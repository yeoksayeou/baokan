<h3>鮑爾溫向下院　宣言促進英法德友誼緩和國際騷擾保障國聯盟約霍爾謂希特勒舉動鑄成大錯</h3>
<p>偷敦英相鮑爾溫在下院開始關於政府國防計畫白皮書之辯論時聲稱、英國外交政策之目的、在爲英帝國與世界各國人民謀取和平、國際軍縮會議屢决努力之使人失望的結果、及他國軍備之逐漸膨脹、已使英國除整頓國防、俾履行其在國聯盟約義務、並維護自己外、別無他法云、首相言及德國最近廢止洛迦諾公的一舉所造成之危局、謂法德間疑忌一日存在、則歐洲永遠和平、一日不能存在云、</p>
<p>工黨領袖艾特里於首相發言後提出工黨彈劾政府政策之動議、謂白皮書不過示人英國從事於軍備競爭耳、工黨議員固準備成立爲集體安全所必要之國防、但不準備更進一步云、自由黨辛克萊稱、白皮書空泛而欠明悉、渠固痛恨破壊條的之舉動、但覺希特勒有建設性質的提議、應予以平心靜氣之研究云、</p>
<p>前外相霍爾言德國在萊茵之行爲、謂渠信德國此舉、實屬大錯、且可謂爲罪行、但渠不願用醜詆之詞、渠以爲德國此舉、撼動國際公的之基礎、因此渠贊成艾登所發雖德國最好朋友、亦不能吾認德國乃今日歐洲難題中及英國國防程序中總原因之言論、渠想下院議員當皆亦以爲然也云、</p>
<p>鮑爾起而發言時、下院無一虛席、極形擁擠、首相先述白皮書之旨趣、繼謂政府雖已屢次失敗、今猶希望可獲締結軍縮恊定之根據、在上週杪時事發展以南、渠已作此語、今仍一再聲明之、以爲政府之目的、國防不獨繫於英國之外交政策、日亦繫於各國之外交政策、戰事一國可發之、而和平則需十五國謀致之、英國政府當繼續施用英國之權威與勢力以緩和國際之不寗、而保障國聯盟的原則之成功、惟英政府未有可忽視他處戰爭之魚險者、亦未有可忽視英國參加國聯之後果者、一方面當設法避免爭端、一方面亦不得閃避其必須有之責任、更不得甘心使其國家無堅强與設備充分之國防、英國必須保持其固有的自由、完全無缺也、渠確信政府不能阻止侵略國之作戰、除非此侵略國深知戰局一開、彼必立遭武裝抵抗耳、歐洲今猶不能語此、新式戰爭之整個元素、厥爲出人不意、未雨綢繆之國家、較諸事後彌縫之國家、實處於更堅强之地位、下院議員聞艾登之言論、感想或不一致、但未有一人不願其巴黎與日內瓦之行順利圓滿也、法德互相疑忌、長此不已、安有歐洲永遠和平之可能、法國欲安全、而德國欲平等、彼等最好希望、已屢决終成畫餅、有時爲法國錯過接受一種提議之機會所致、有時爲德國有所行動破壞條的、震動人心所致、今唯一之希望、在成就德法英三國間之三角友誼、苟不如是、則歐洲終難免除危急恐慌之時代云、</p>
<p>殖民大臣湯姆生起而發言、結束第一日之辯論、謂有一二發言者、竟謂一月之內大戰將作、此說未免神經過敏、以言自治領對於白皮書之態度、在慶祝英皇喬治御極二十五年紀念時、整個國防地位已向自治領之代表言之、此後白皮書內容、亦完蚤轉吿各自治領、各方一致、不獨默認之、且覺此爲應予以援助之政策、各自治領贊助國聯會員國集體安全之辦法、並參加英政府所採行之種種步驟、且有自行設法以安固其防務者、殖民地亦表示願助成英帝國一般防務之準備云、辯論至是、乃展至今日、大的午前十一時可表决、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>艾登演辭全文</h3>
<p>偷敦英外相艾凳今日在下院發言、斥黃德國片面廢止洛迦諾公的之舉動、並宜布英政府對此發展之態度、謂三月六日渠請駐英德大使到外部、吿以十二月十三日駐德英大使通知德政府之提議、主張羅卡諾公的簽宇國應巡行天空公的之談判、英政府認此約之成立、可爲西方三大國間關係穩固之原素、三月七日德大使又到外部向渠聲稱、已接到甚重要文件、旋交出備忘錄、英外相以備忘錄中重耍點指示德大使、復吿以非俟有機會研究此文、並與同僚考慮新局勢後、渠不能作詳細之談話、同時渠又吿德大使、德政府在不駐兵區域之行爲、渠聞之深爲扼腕、想德大使亦當以此舉等於片面取銷自由商定的條的之行爲、渠固知德政府對於法俄條的影響之觀念、惟羅卡諾公的其他簽字國並不抱此觀念、如德政府不理會其他簽的國之意見、而仍抱自己論斷、則儘可提交公斷、渠恐片面廢的在英國朝野輿情上之影響亦茶鉅大、渠與德大使晤談時、言及德國來文之後段、吿以英政府將考慮之、惟覺關於德國對國聯態度之宣言、最關重要、德大使於此、乃謂英首相與外相屢决聲明英政府之政策、以國聯與集體安全爲根據、德政府歡迎合此種意見、乃有此關於國聯之决定、德國願參加此種政策、並未有復入國聯之條件、德政府雖希望將來國聯盟的與凡爾賽和的脫離、而殖民地等權利問題亦獲解决、但此非爲條件、不過爲德國復入國聯之談判事件耳云、</p>
<p>艾登於追述與德大使晤談情形後、繼續致詞日、德國來文之重要、自無待言、余現可爲下院告者、法政府已得英政府之完全同意、而請國聯行政院立即召集、以考慮此局勢矣、國聯行政院爲處理此事之適當機關、聞行政院定下星期五日集議、在未開會時當然未能有何决定、惟除德國外之洛迦諾公的四簽字國、明日將在巴黎交換意見、後日在日內瓦繼續此項談話、英國代表之參加此談話者、將爲掌壓大臣與余二人、時局之進展、在若千方面上現仍曖昧英代表前往日內瓦應付此問題、所抱之覜念與意旨、下院當然願立即稍知之、此乃應有之舉、蓋人人應了解英國此時在歐洲時事中明瞭統一的輿情之穩定的勢力也、吾人其勿自欺、德政府所採片面廢止其所自由承認的義務、而視同無物之行逕、已使國際形勢愈臻糾紛、而愈形嚴重、洛迦諾公的之廢止、與不駐兵區域之佔領、已撼動德政府將來所締結任何契的之信用、本院中或本國中未有一人願寬恕此種步驟者、因其對於國際關係全部結構所賴的條的尊嚴之原則、已予以重大打擊也、余可幸言者、現未有理由可謂德國目前舉動含有仇敵威嚇少意、因德政府在其備忘錄中言及其對於歐洲眞正和平之不可改變的期望、並表示其與法比二國締結互不侵略公的之願意也、但若有人對於英國爲洛迦諾公的簽字國之地位稍有誤會、則英政府認爲有須聲明者、如在爲考慮新局勢所必要之時期中、法比遭受攻擊、致破壊洛迦諾公約第二條、則德國縱吾認此的、英政府亦當認爲榮譽所關、必以此約所規定之形式、出爲被攻擊國之後盾也、在現有環境中、將不良之過去變爲較好之將來、此種轉移實爲艱苦工作、此必爲一般人所共悉者、今西歐和平主要基礎之一、業已傾陷、欲重致和平、則吾人實負重業此基礎之職責、吾人今必以此精神應付德允首之新提議、英政府現將透澈研究之、以期査明其建議可使已被撼動的和平基礎重行鞏固者、究達何種程度、在目前國際事件嚴重狀况中、英政府覺凡可有改善希望之任何機會、皆不宜交臂失之、余以爲余有理由應請下院各黨爲政府後盾、以處理須以世界智慧與政治手腕應付常前艱苦事件云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯認艾登宣言一種緩和勢力法國人士贊否參半</h3>
<p>日內瓦國聯方面今日解釋英國外相艾登在下院之演說、認爲係此次因德國廢棄洛迦諾條的及電新駐兵萊茵河區所引起之危機中、一種緩和之勢力云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎英國艾登外相本日在下議院發表演說、就德國廢止羅卡諾公約行爲、說明英國之立塲、此間政界人士、評論此項演詞、對於艾登貶斥片面廢的行爲之一段、表示滿意、但以爲依照羅卡諾公約規定、如有在萊茵河非武裝區域重行設防者、當與實際侵略行爲視同一體、此層艾登未予道及、殊足惋惜、又觀於艾登演詞、英國對於德國所提建議、現已準備加以考慮、此在法國則業已明白拒絕、於以見英法兩國態度、顯已不同、負責方面以爲英國既係羅卡諾公約担保國、自不能與被担保之法國抱同一見解、以故在國聯曾行政院未採决定之前、英國願採客觀態度、自亦情理之常、惟負責方面又謂、法國或有與德國進行談判之可能、但以下列兩項爲條件、卽　德國軍隊退出萊茵河非武裝區域、　在國聯會主持下舉行會議、日後若與德國訂立協定、應由第三國出而担保是也、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎英國艾登外相、昨日在下議所發表之演說、此間各報均加以評論、大體均謂演詞若干段、足使法國完全滿意、但有數段、空洞無物、蓋艾登所擬原稿、業於昨日午前內閣會議時、經過修改矣、事業報載稱、艾登演詞原稿、係經首相鮑爾溫親自改竄、「首相並以艾登素主擁護國聯會、而前陸軍大臣哈立法克司勛爵、則以親德著稱、故派哈氏於今後對德談判時、翊贊艾登、以資調劑」、該報又稱、比國總理齊蘭、昨日傍晚一抵此間、卽與外交部長佛蘭亭會晤、曾向外長聲明、比國將與法國一致行動、揆其用意、蓋謂非俟德軍由萊茵河沿岸非武裝區域撤退之後、未可進行談判是也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>偷敦外相艾登、本日在下議院所發表之演說、各議員無論多數派與反對派、均一致表示贊成、其言論幷爲全塲一致之歡呼聲、與「君等其各聆取」之聲所間斷、前後共有二决、一决係謂「德國廢北羅卡諾公的、出兵萊茵河非武裝區域之舉、可使德國政府關於履行國際的束之信用、爲之根本動搖、」一决係謂「侵略行動發行之際、英國政府仍願遵守諾言、尊重條約、而援助法比兩國云、國會人士頃評論外相演詞、以爲艾登對於德國希特勒元首所提建議、僅謂當就未來談判形勢、加以考慮、並未逕允開始談判、特談判途徑、亦未閉絕耳、保守黨、自由黨與工黨、對於外相演說、雖均表示贊同、但其所依據之理由各不相同、保守黨以爲、德國廢約之後、該國誠信不孚、無論如何、信誓旦旦、他國愈益不敢推心置腹、惟此際英國陸海空軍、尙嫌薄弱、若果採取强制行動、則責任重大、恐非英國所能擔負、自未可造决出之、至工黨與左蠶自由黨人士、以爲希特勒元首所提建議、並非總國政策主要部份、允其是工纖領袖人士、以爲德國此項建議、係以獲取他國選民之同情爲目的、其關於重返國聯會一層、允具此項作用云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林英首相包爾溫及外相艾登昨在下院所發之演詞、極爲此間報紙所歡迎、德報均以爲英政府深信德國不欲作侵略戰爭、並稱、英外相艾登已啟對歐洲前途作合理的討論之門戶云（十日路透社電）</p>

<p>巴黎法總理薩勞今日在衆院發言、對希特勒廢止洛迦諾公的之備忘錄、作針鋒相對之答覆、謂德國之破壞不駐兵區域、不獨涉及法國安全、且亦影響歐洲和平前途與國聯下集體安全之組織、吾人爲國聯機構决定吾人立場、因國聯命運不久將受危害也、吾入以德國文化與民族德性之名義、請德人慎思其新責任、他國人民甚願德人在歷史中負此責任也、吾人莊重聲明、吾人始終不願侵犯德國之自由與榮譽、法國不以德國之禍爲利、凡可鞏固和平前途與增進法德之談判、法國未嘗拒絕之、但不能在暴力下與吾認自由畫定的條的下談判之也、法國準備與國聯其他會員國聯合、而對於破壞國際條約。破壞集體安全。與破壞和平結構之計謀、予以答覆、一旦國際公法之尊嚴恢復、法國準備與德國談判、德國既已撕毁自願簽定之洛迦諾公的、法國自有其應付之權、法國某報近曾登載希特勒之談片、據謂希特勒願與法國接近、並警告、如不理會此種姿勢、則將發生嚴重後果、此談片發表後、法國駐德大使龐賽卽在柏林有所接洽、法國之和平精神於此可見、總理於是詢問德國之破壞洛迦諾公的與凡爾賽和的、是吾爲希特勒所元法大使龐賽之答覆、繼謂法國承認已多、忍耐已久、蓋希望萊茵河對面有一種情感、以代猜忌與反覆耳、惟德國已以接續打擊條的爲答覆、其最後之打撃、最爲惡劣、不知德國是吾欲威脅法國與之談話乎、總理末謂、與德談話之問題今固存在、但在德國暴力行動所造成空氣中、無一能進行之也、此種事態、不能究其繼續、法政府已决議訴諸國聯、國聯審查破壞洛迦諾公的與凡爾賽和的之行動後、將决定制裁問題云、（十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>希特勒廢約　迫於內部危機　經濟部長外長陸長　會議時曾反對此舉</h3>

<h3>墨索裡尼爲什麽要戰爭</h3>
<p>— Lious　Pisher作　賓符譯</p>
<p>——殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之四（下）</p>
<p>拉底尼和羅索尼最精彩的演辭是我在上院所聽到的。墨索里尼也在那裹受人熱烈地歡呼着，但當披得蒙的皇子和四位護從的皇族到來時，那「薩伏衣」，「薩伏衣」轟雷般的歡呼聲，却也使我不敢相信他們以前不曾吾受過同樣的歡呼。這五位貴人到上議院來，並不坐他們華麗的自動車，而是坐着雙轡的馬車來的。這不過是一種無意識的習慣，但却也可算是一種象徵，一種保守主義的允其是對於地主有密切連繫的象徵。上議院中有許多地主貴族階級的領袖。那是很明顯的皇室貴族和地主的特權階級存在一天，那意大利的全部荒蕪的土地便沒有分配給鬧着土地荒的農民的一天。在上議院中，除了學術界和軍政界的代表外，還坐着許多的大企業家。那又是一種特別賦予的權利。墨索里尼當然討厭這些反動團體的。他只有設法把立法的機能减低，但有一點却是可以證明了，那政治的獨裁者在經濟和社會方面却是不能完全由他獨裁的。</p>
<p>這就回答了墨索里尼爲什麽耍發動朿菲戰爭的問題了。十四年前，意大利幾乎發生了社會革命。工人們實際上已佔據了許多的工廠，如果有更堅决的領導，也許他們早已成功了。農民們皆公開地對他們凄慘的生活叛亂起來。資本家都嚇壞了，經濟也失却了力量只對着意大利在大戰中的所得失望，除却膽小如鼠的法格得外，再也找不到一個比較强幹的人材。於是就來了墨索里尼。當時國內曾經過許多次的武裝衝突，其中有一决便是墨索里尼的法西斯蒂派跟羅索尼的社會工團主義派衝突。墨索里尼終於把羅索尼和其他的人都一起收在他自已的幕下。他以陰險的手段消弭了反對的勢力，並且得到維持現狀派的擁護。接着在那有名的羅馬行進後，便以皇命組織法西斯內閣。墨索里尼又撲滅了工人的組織。他以新的希望和自尊心激勵布爾喬亞。當時鄉村和都市中仍希望着社會革命來解放新的生產力。但是那些希望革命者被壓制着，而反對革命者却很得勢，結果只形成了一種政治的變化。在墨索里尼的壓力之下，這種舊時的問題還在醞釀着。墨索里尼只是盡力地幹。他創辦了許多公共工程以救濟失業，同時却因此增加了國家的負擔。他對於布爾喬亞嚴密地監視者，雖然他曾敎他們自尊，可是他却並不尊重他們。他繼續地救濟他們，使他們不得不馴服。也許他也注意到下層階級的貧困，可是他却不能也不願從事任何經濟或社會的基本改革。</p>
<p>在地主和城市布爾喬亞的生活限度內，墨索里尼對於意大利的經濟方面確已盡了他的所能。但不久他又敏捷地覺察到這種限度是太狹隘了，便開始準備另一種的刺激。這種刺激並不是在帝國發展的經濟利益。法西斯蒂他們自己對於征服阿比西尼亞所得的物質利益也很懷疑的。羅索尼對我說：「我們在阿比西尼亞的行軍，完全靠着大量的金錢並利用空荒的土地。」意大利爲了開發阿比西尼亞不得不借外債，借到了她才能用以購買原料在國內鑄造軍器。一九三四年在伊里特里亞全境只有三千四百的意大利居民，其中大多還是官吏和敎士。什麽能够保證在阿比西尼亞會有較好的結果呢？</p>
<p>法西斯蒂往往注意其他比物質條伴更重要的東西。一九三五年十一月十四日“Messagero”報所載羅馬長官波大依一文中，曾說：「自然，阿比西尼亞的財富是問題的因素之一……是許多因素之一，但並不是最主要的因素。」意大利負有一種使命；她必須去宣揚文化。意大利是壯健的她必須宣洩她的熱情和勇氣。假使意大利在國內發展有很大的可能，她的統治者對於後輩靑年也許就要這樣說：「預備富强起來啊！創造新的機械！建設新的實業和城市，領導着意大利趨向偉大的經濟建設！」然而這些可能是並不存在的。所以統治者說：「戰爭是光榮」——爲戰爭而戰爭。這種神秘的崇拜在處於經濟和社會的絕境中的政府成爲必需了。像血和土地這種抽象的價値以及所謂把歐洲的文化帶到黑暗的非洲去這種高調兒，竟能得到了實在的效果，驅使千百的人民去作最眞誠的努力和最大的犧牲，這未始不是近來宣傳和敎育的力量吧，——雖然現在只有少數的意大利人還在信服征伐阿比西尼亞的高尙的意義。在寡頭統治的拘束之下，意大利法西斯主義作繭自縛着，却又想用利刀斬斷它。但是結還未斷，却先斬傷自己了。無論有着阿比西尼亞與否，法西斯主義者是必須面對意大利國內的問題的。因此，這所謂神秘的崇拜一定將永無止境，而且必然會產生新的目標——埃及，印度？如果英國不經抵抗放棄了阿比西尼亞，到那時意大利也許更會說，佔頒尼羅區域，是此敎化阿比西尼亞還不費時和力啊。</p>
<p>不論他們在阿比西尼亞的收穫多少，意大利的法西斯蒂是永遠不會滿足的。在阿比西尼亞得不到什麽慰藉，墨索里尼也許是知道的。幾星期以前有人聽到他對許多外國人說，阿比西尼亞戰爭也許會把他激成去領導社會革命。他將怎麼幹雖不曾說起，可是這却會有着深長的意義，墨索里尼已很明白地知道他是失敗了。</p>

<h3>兩廣實業考察團報吿（二）</h3>
<p>— 仰自舟中寄</p>
<p>舟中之分組研究與談話</p>
<p>團員在風平浪靜之舟中，適得從容研究之機會，因由團長提議分爲幣制。稅則。工業合作·三組，每組十一人，由團長爲召集人，幣制問題所研究者，爲希望穩定申粤匯兌，其相差率不超過百分之三，更希望粤桂匯兌之平衡，允希望當局之取締非法操縱換兌行市，稅則組所研究者，爲兩省徵收外貨與國貨之稅則，希望應有分別，而工業合作問題，則粤桂貨物之外輸，原料之採集，彼此需要品之交換，在在有密切關係，希望於此行交換意見中，得一溝通貿易之辦法，彼此都得利益，</p>
<p>舟中無意間遇伍廷　先生，伍君爲廣西容縣人，在廣西從政有年，於建設及農村事業允有成績，新簡浙江建設廳長，將赴任，適丁太夫人之憂，此决係回家料理喪事，因得談話之機會，記者因詢廣西之實業狀况，伍君言，一省實業，基於原料交通銷塲三點，桂省近正致力於此三者，希望不久之將來，或有發展之希望，但目下尙談不到實業也，廣西省當局所揭橥之自衛自治自給三大目標，自衛自治尙易做到，以言自給，則談何容易，吾今戚覺到自足自給，施之於省確屬不易，卽一個國家，除了國防關係，或在特殊情况之下，亦覺非常困難，不過藉此多方想法努力生產，未始非國難中之一種辦法，决言今日農村凋敝，首在獎勵副業，與改進手工業，亦屬念要，至較大工業，與其以官廳力量，不如招集熱心之企業家加入合作，惟生產社會化，與歡迎外資，尙是一個硏究間題云云，見解透切，目光如炬，同人均爲敬服，伍君力勸，團員赴桂以後，可經湘贛浙回滬，則此行可得到五省的觀察，似更有價値，船中又遇漢口市政府參議唐少昌君，盛稱，廣西民團之發達，每年訓練五萬人，目下全省已有四十萬人，都屬二十歲左右之靑年，每日侵晨上換，撃劍武術打靶等，均極嫻熟，此項靑年，都爲有職業分子，集中訓練於武鳴，精神之振作，允可敬佩，唐君又言，廣西目下無一土匪，無一乞丐，卽此一點，已見自治自衛之成績，苟於經濟上再得一完蕃之出路，則未來希望，允無限量，凡此均考察團前往觀光前之參考資料也，</p>
<h3>上海之證券業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之十七）　沿革</p>
<p>上海證券業之與起。可分爲三個階段。其一爲民三以前之茶會時一代。其二爲民九以前之公會時代。其三即目前之交易所時代。茲分別說明之。</p>
<p>一茶會時代之證券業，崛起於民國元年。斯特因蘇浙路之收歸國有。及元年六厘公債之發行。一時證券買賣大盛。於是所謂股票掮客之名詞。亦應運而生。初僅二三人。至民三而增至十餘人。其成交方法。買賣價格。均大抵由掮客自由定出。漫無標準。蓋因買賣雙方。對於證券之性質及價值。大半未澈底明瞭。且一般人士。對於各種證券。均欠信仰。故求售者但願早日脫手。而不斤斤於市値之高低也。所以成交方式。亦極簡單。旣無所謂定與買賣。亦無所謂的期成交。故從事證券業之掮客。其於佣金之微收。初無規定。而經營份子。亦極複雜。錢商有之。茶商有之。皮貨商有之。骨董商有之。雜貨商亦有之。誠爲形形色色混合而成之新職業團體也。上文所述。雖不過爲歷史上之一頁。但亦足供研究證券事業之參考也。（未完）</p>

<h3>我國代表出席巴黎　國際天文協會之報吿</h3>
<p>上年七月十日、巴黎國天文協會開會、我國曾派代表二人出席、會后由出席代表高平子（均）向敎部報告出席會議經過、原文甚長、其大要謂「到會人數」計德叫人、奧二人、此二五人、加拿大六人、中國二人、梵諦岡一人、丹麥八人、埃及一人、西班牙十二人、愛都尼一人、美三六人、法一四九人、英八九人、荷二一人、印一人、意二一人、日二人、瑙威二人、波蘭五人、葡萄牙六人、羅馬尼一六人、瑞典七人、瑞士六人、捷克十人、蘇俄八人、共二十五國四百四十一人、（被邀人數內包括正式會員及列席會員、其正式會員各國不同、因各國所組之天文委員會人數不同也、</p>
<p>會議概况、此决開會第一决全體大會、頗爲隆重、但亦只重形式由法國總統蒞臨、敎育部長主席、演說者四人、由巴台附設之國際時辰局用電影表演測時及報時情形、由主任講解、演畢即散會、最后一日上午大會則係通過各分組之决議案、隨讀隨通、極少討論、亦一形式而已、下午大會、則爲新舊職員交替之演說、各職員之選、均在理事會確定、並未在會塲選舉、各分組城舉委員亦然、此外則爲宣布下决大會在瑞典京舉行、下屆會長當選者爲巴台長Esclangonn君、兩决大會中間均爲分組會議以及游覽招待、十日巴黎天文台招待係交際性質、末參觀儀器、十三十五十六等日分組會議、與參觀及宴會、十七日上午全體大會、通過各分組决議案、下午大會幷行閉幕式、</p>
<p>天文展覽會即設於大會會塲之下、所列均爲儀器照片、星氣照片及圖表等項、材料不甚豐富、我國携去紫金山天文台圖冊等亦陳列一案、會后即轉交法國天文學會保存、</p>
<p>各種提案、均爲分組會議討論、照章各提案須於大會開會之前五個月寄到秘書處、印入草案冊內、分送各會員、我國以前尙未加入恊會、並未預備提案、且每組開會時間短促、大的不過一二小時、臨時提案更不可能、惟各組開會時、與會人員、可以自由選擇參加、俾便明瞭現在天文學中各支進行狀况、及此后應走之方向、</p>
<p>此次我國代表二人、會參加各組爲第十組（太陽黑子、）第十一組（色球現氣、）第十二組（太陽放射及光譜、）第十三組（日蝕）第十八組（經度、）第二七及光組（變星、）第三十一組（時辰局）等分組會議、性質注重事實及合件方面、如請求補助費、觀測地點及時間之分配，觀測方法及儀器之選定、名詞記號及印刷品之統一等項、至專屬學理及偭人研究問題而無關合作者、皆不在討論範圍、亦無宣讀論文時間、此點爲我國以后出席時所應注意、其有學理必須在提案中說明者、亦以愈簡愈妙、俾不至占時太多、</p>
<p>加此决太陽黑子組、西班牙代表提議、將太陽面上分別東西兩半及南北兩半計數、乃係根據其個人硏究各半之黑子數各有不同、彼之初步結果爲西半球黑子數常少於東半球、地球在北時、南半球黑子多於北半球、地球在南時、則相反、彼意皆受地球之影響、故有分別計數之提案、此種提案、不能不先講理論、一涉理論、便廢時間、故其一提案之說明、幾占會議時間百分之八十、可見純粹論文更無宣讀之餘暇也、</p>
<p>變星組（第二十七組）討論增加委員及分區觀測、謂備有許多變星圖待用、並請特別注意各型變星、有人全張分區守望新星、未有决議、</p>
<p>日食組（第十三組）主要討論爲日本及蘇俄代表報告一千九百三十六年日食路線地方情形、及觀測隊計劃、日本擬在北海道觀測、蘇俄則在西比利亞擬組織觀測隊五六處云、據此則民國三十年之日蝕、我國對於地方氣候等情形、必須早爲調查、以備提出報告、</p>
<p>色球現象組（第十一組）討論爆發之定義、及增加配錄爆發性黑綫等問題、重要决議、其一、努力改善太陽分光儀之使用、及增設此項儀器於相當地點、俾便在格林維基零時左右、作有益之觀測、其一、觀測爆發性日珥、每間三五分鐘一决、所用儀器、或爲Deslandres太陽分光寫眞儀器、附有視綫速度自記器者、或用太陽分光觀一測寫眞聯合儀器、作目視或照相之觀測、或用B－Iyot式直接或電影法照相觀測、最好此三種方法同時並用、俾日后决定在某天文台特殊氣候情形之下、何種方法最爲相宜、此外各組內均有請求補助費之議案、每組决定后、再送經濟委員會通過、</p>
<p>以上不過略舉各組會議情形之一班、其詳備議案、當俟大會正式報告書內刊布、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（九）（六）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>金髮兒已經被蜀姨母帶走，她的爸爸大吃一驚，他奇怪，驚疑，和急切要知道，「到底是什麼一回事」，他這種詫異的情形顯然還過於裴爾先生。</p>
<p>等過了許多悉力索落，丁丁打打，以及後臺老班淸晰可辨的種種指揮，最後那布幕方跟了悠揚的昔樂冉冉上升，只看見小珮絲－即金髮兒－坐在黃紙做成的火爐旁一個個小小凳上。我們從沒有見過更可愛，小灰娘了；（註五）因爲那灰色的袍子甚是破爛，那渺小的鞋子都已破了，可是那臉兒罩以光亮的髪，十分美麗，而容態却甚頹喪，所以凡看到這個小小戲子的，因爲愛憐之故，微笑之後，也至出涕。她安靜坐着，直到一個聲音輕輕說道：「現在來罷」！－於是她作一聲可笑的嘆聲，並且說道：「呀，我願也我得赴那個跳舞會」！說得那麽自然，致使她的父親在拍其手，　的母親叫了一聲「小寳貝」！他們這麽情不自禁地流露了他們的感情使灰娘也忘了自己，搖着她的頭，以責備的口吻對他們說道：「你們不可以對我說話的。」</p>
<p>（註五）灰娘CinJerella爲泰西民間流傳之故事叙一貧　之美女子，爲後母所虐待，仙人助其赴跳舞會，爲一王子所眷，追之急，遺一小履，王子徵幕各女子，如其能穿着適合者，當娶之，諸女子雖欲削足納屨亦無效，而惟灰娘能之，因娶焉。</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、各月微見回下、本月又進二百元關鬥、蓋以海外花紗漲風已戢、大阪三品紗回跌六七角、於是塲中買者不旺、人氣淡泊、市價盤盤回小、但長豐依然購進、由空翻多、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌六·八。九角至一元一角、午後開盤、近月形勢又緊張、拍至遠月上漲六。七角、二盤後徐徐回落、以大阪三品紗仍向下墮、買氣和平、結果中期比上午收盤價均跌三·四角、餘則勿動、查賣出大孚叫百包、澄記一千二百五十包、大豐一千零五十包、達記一千包、頤大六百五十包、大昌成一千九百五十包、潤康七百包、信誠八百五十包、錦昌九百五十包、合興四百包、買　德大四百九十包、森康六百五十包、同豐五百五十包、仁豐一千一百五十包、益昶一千包、長費二千二百五十包、吉豐九百包、泰昌七百五十包、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現紗銷旺價平</p>
<p>現紗銷場良好、查全日各帮成交統計一千三百二十一包、售價與上日無異、各帮買額如下、</p>
<h3>棉花漲風已　現貨走勢甚佳</h3>
<p>棉市略起反動、因上日漲風太熾、而海外棉市漲風已戢、人心和平、多頭獲利了結、因此市價回平、但現棉情形巽常緊俏、通州花市價大漲云</p>
<p>標花信誠拋出</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、局勢和平、因美棉現貨勿動、遠期跌一至五磅音、印棉雖大漲、組絨漲三羅比半、細絨漲五羅牛、然隔日早已料到、昨則來電無甚作用矣、大阪二品花跌二一三角、近月市勢疲乏、跌五分至一角、拍至遠月、買氣反見濃烈、上漲五分、二·三盤信誠大量拋出、轉趨下挫、結果各月比上日收盤價跌一·二角至三角半、午後開盤、人氣有一度熱烈、近月漲二·三·角、遠漲一·二·角、二盤以後、聞印棉暗盤跌三羅比、市象稍鬆、迨至收盤、聞現棉緊張、市價步昇、遠月復漲、結果近月比上午收盤價漲一角半、遠漲五分、查賣出大孚三千九百擔、振大一千八百擔、廣豐三千五百擔、大昌成一千九百擔、信誠匕千八百擔、長和二千七百擔、益康二千六百擔、買進慎記六千七百擔、元一二千叫百據、益昶三千八百擔、源興昌二千四百擔、泰昌一千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>通花售價猛漲</p>
<p>現棉消費活躍、中外各廠進胃頗強、售價俏利、來源</p>
<h3>美棉漲風曇花一現　英印棉價所漲不少</h3>
<p>美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月漲五至十磅音、旋以外國政治情形、利物浦上漲、同業及外商買進、市價步昂、惜繼起無人、而囤錦處反售出三月期、紐奧崙及棉農亦有套賣、致市價回小、其一後同業買進近期、遠期多頭了結、在華盛頓未有一發展以前、仍抱觀望態度、現需不振、紡織品市一况靜寂、棉業交易所估計、全世界棉花存底、截至正月底止、連同未採之花、共爲二五、六六一、〇〇〇包、內中美棉運同政府借欵之棉、共爲一三、三七四、〇〇〇包、去年同期爲一四、五〇二、〇〇〇包、收盤平穩、計現貨未動、期貨由不動至跌五磅音、英棉現貨漲十一點、期貨漲四至七點、印棉補空及期貨商買進、遇歐洲出口商賣出及多頭獲利了結、輸出暢達、計平果爾漲三·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲六·二五至六·七五羅比、白羅溪漲五·二五至五·七五羅比、原電綠左、（九日電）　又據孟買電、十日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲一百九十五羅比、較上日收盤跌二·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花略跌</h3>
<p>十日大阪電、三品期紗跌一元一角至一元五角、近月爲一百九十一元、遠月爲一百九十一元四角、期棉跌五分至四角、近月爲六十一元七角、遠月爲五十九元四角、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉麥近跌遠漲</h3>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份依然穩固、以洋麥雖回落二三角、惟以國際風雲、未能捉摸、且以歐戰之殷鑒可怖、糧食商人大致看高、故近遠期開價、又較漲一三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初仍俏利、後以粉市回鬆、內地帮之多頭回出、市面遂回落二三分不等、後步情形、半看國外、半看國內新麥之脚地如何耳、現麥市面、見交不多、價則徵好二分、開江北麥五元二角半、天台麥五元二角二分、計七百包、由福阜兩家辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、最近空頭補進、脚地致反鬆懈需要頗談、上週可見供給估計减少二、九三八、〇〇〇斛、加麥可見供給减少一、四一六、〇〇〇斛、</p>
<p>粉上午開盤、各月份又見一致猛升、洋麥價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、難回落二三角左右、惟市塲人心、及一般業外多頭、鑒於歐局變化、防須擴大、故浮空既亟於抵補、內地帮金融幇亦逐步爭進、是以近期雖平、遠期則續漲二三分不等、二盤后因廠方售出、回落近分、迨至下午開盤、交易尙暢、惟近期有多頭回出、遠期則廠方續套、故趨勢又稍軟弱、結果近期跌去一分零、遠期仍好一分以上、全日成交計達八十餘一萬包云、</p>
<h3>客去化突旺　售價步升三四角</h3>
<p>昨日客秈、到頭仍有長江一帶、惟去化突旺、除本街内地外、南北各帮均有應酬、允以囤戶爲最貪、因目下各糧一律飛升、米價合划尙廉、故一得引起囤戶問津、客囤既旺、價乃逐步飛升、上一午已漲二角左右、午後續漲一二角、而形勢尙在繼續望好中、全日開出贛米三千六百五十包、湘漢沙市各米一千八百五十包、台紹安慶等三千五百包、</p>
<p>洋米連日交易不旺、昨本街囤戶與客戶均有問津、還邏米　現貨開三百包外、由廣泰降拋出五月份一千噸、價五元二角半、此價比之上週四元八角之價已漲起四角半之多、大小絞久無交易、昨開出小絞一千九百六十包、大絞八百包、價比去冬已步砌近兀、因售開之貨尙係低决云、又西貢米六千一百包、運往南京、</p>
<h3>食米銷動回漲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源井到四十餘號、市况初則仍疲、後因客尖見漲、故零躉銷場俱現活絡、結果蘇同粳價升一角、南港早稻漲一二角、薄稻計靑烟津威等帮共去近四千包、行情提起一角七分、杜洋尖及陰變兀均見挺秀、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源的卅號、市上各貨去胃白粳店銷轉活、市形高料挺秀、中决漲起一二角、薄稻零銷亦佳、價加尺外、羊杜尖到少銷活、價形加一二角、埠客尖零拆續動、價好角餘、白元零胃平常、價形定局、其餘各貨價亦加緊角外、</p>
<h3>業外紛起購進　糧交市場突形熱鬧</h3>
<p>標準油豆、咋市行情盤旋不一、大連電訊略見一盤漲、實銷尙佳、然無整批出口、故本市廠戶與行號方面繼續拋售、但自歐洲時局變化後、市場上突形熱鬧、往日注意金市證券之客戶均趨糧所、買氣特別見旺、胃口亦比業中爲貪、故開價立即步漲、旋以行廠套賣、市叉回平、收市油價無大出入、而豆價又見步砌二三分云、又十二日雜糧麺粉兩交易所停市一天、</p>
<h3>糖市　興海赤號盤略跌</h3>
<p>開十二元半…成交九百餘包</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢堅定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二元三角、貨基稀缺未成、轉口貨七元一角、略有成交、東赤白及本綿白均原價無更動、號盤有建幫開出安海赤九百餘包、價爲十二元五角、比前略跌、因興化明京赤客貨較廉所致、又潮幫開出枝洋赤八十餘包、較高者十四元二角至一角半、次之十三元七角、又枝赤四十四件、十三元五角、又開出麥茅糖十聽、每擔七元四角、</p>
<h3>海味　冬菇香菌非善價不沽</h3>
<p>冬菇各路來源均跌、更兼存底又薄、如遇大批採辦、即有供給爲難之勢、所以行號手貨、莫不扳緊而沽、售盤因此逐步提高、大阪高貨四百二十元、普通四百元、决至三百八十元、屯溪貨二百四五十元、蘭溪貨二百七八十元、</p>
<p>香菌屯溪到貨不旺、存貨者乘機居奇、售價叫升一百九十元、福建貨亦續有到、惟高檔缺而統貨多、昨日號盤開出、高貨八件、價一百六十八元半·統貨三十三件、價自一百五十五元至一百四十二元、行方進胃尙佳、得以如數售通、</p>
<h3>絲茶　貢熙綠茶客銷活動</h3>
<p>近日洋莊茶市、異常沉靜、各歐莊均以國外茶銷不振、進意至爲冷淡、惟實熙綠茶、昨天津靑島等客帮頗多搜辦、聞已由協泰祥同義興等茶莊辦去八百餘箱、市盤售開十五元五角、此外紅綠茶花香末片、無錫常州等帮亦有六十餘包裝出、價開六元四角左右云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　花色呢絨生意突减</h3>
<p>呢絨交易、昨日依然暢盛、本客均有成交、客幫如四川·江西·長沙·首都等進胃稍健、餘在華北一帶略有購辦、花色貨呢絨西裝料、生意更形减少、據最近國府命令佈告、軍政學界諸機關大小職員、一律改穿中山學生裝、不得再穿西裝、致西裝花色套頭料生意突减、除上海一埠外、內地之專做西裝客衣店、莫不憂形於色、但如元常中厚嗶嘰薄素嗶嘰元常華達呢元素花呢等生意則大爲生色也、</p>
<h3>五金　英會司鐵走勢突盛</h3>
<p>自花旗會司鐵、被廠家及囤戶搜羅後、底貨即吿斷檔、故買主方面、因無貨可購、不得不購買其貨、以資替代、故昨英會司鐵走勢突盛、全市開出共達三叫百箱之多、而繼續收辦者仍多、行情因市貨有供不敷求、是以市盤扶搖直上、每箱開價已漲至三十元、比前好起二元之多、惟連日一歐洲因德國廢約後空氣突緊、故本埠實用此貨之廠家、恐後斷檔、均有收囤心思、故市氣甚好、</p>
<h3>雜訊　三奈號盤又漲一元</h3>
<p>日前號方所辦之三奈、茲已由海元輪運到三十三件、昨已見樣、貨品色澤及身骨均較前批爲次、因値市存斷缺、行方進胃仍濃、當即開出二十七包、價比前反漲一元、趨勢緊秀、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （唐增庚）</p>
<p>戀愛至上主義者說：戀愛是生命之花，戀愛是人生過程中的點　，沒有戀愛，人生就顯出了暗淡，生命也就沒有什麼價值了。</p>
<p>失戀者說：戀愛是辛酸的苦漿，戀愛是葬人意志的墳墓，使人感覺到無限止的痛苦，所以，戀愛亦是一個敲擊瀆心肺的槌子。</p>
<p>同樣是一個戀愛，可是因爲二者處境的不同，就有着兩種不同的見解。其實，戀愛是生命之花也罷，戀愛是葬人意志的墳墓也罷，在這個亂動的時代，我們靑年人拋棄了紛紜無緒的國事，家事，以及自身的切身問題不幹，而來斤斤於戀愛的得失，這亦是太無理智，太沒有絲毫的靈魂了。所以，在各事沒有完全辦妥之前，戀愛的觀念，還是整個的拋棄了罷！</p>
<h3>綠衣使者</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>綠衣使者，是郵差的別號。</p>
<p>我國全國的幅員，雖然是那麼的廣大，但是有炊烟的所在，却沒一處，不深深地印上了綠衣使者的足跡。車輪舟楫，所能到達的所在，有綠衣使者，不用說了，就是滿佈着爲跡獸蹄的深山大谷之中，也儘有綠衣使者跋涉着。現在有公路的所在，大家都覺得往來挺便利，殊不知在公路未通之前的一二十年，綠衣使者，早就把足印，重疊地印在那裹了。目前，在廣袤的西北，還儘有綠衣使者，駕着皮筏，或是推着手車，或是挑着担兒？在那裏來來往往。無疑地，綠衣使者，今日所走的崎嶇之路，便是明日寬廣而平坦的公路的路基。這便是綠衣使者的偉大處之一。</p>
<p>英國人說，英國的國旗，遍於全世界的每一角，所以英國的國旗，是沒有落日的。但是在這裹，我敢大胆地說，綠衣使者，在日夜二十四小時中，是沒有一秒鐘的靜止的。白天，是不用說了。就是在半夜裏，在黎明之前，車站上，輪埠上，儘有綠衣使者，在努力地工作着。在內地，交通阻滯的所在，班信差，無間晴雨風雪，按站而限時的用人力遞送着，維持着交通。這便是綠衣使者的偉大處之二。</p>
<p>都市與農村的繁榮，是相互倚賴着的。而其間的媒介，便是綠衣使者。綠衣使者，雖不是金融家，但金融家，却依賴着綠衣使者，流通着金融。此外，綠衣使者，更負起了游子慰藉高堂的使命，而遞送着平安的竹報。自然，閨中少婦，也是日夕盼望着聊慰相思的家信的到達。至於文化落後的農村，所得的智識滋養料，那是更少不來綠衣使者的努力。沒化若綠衣使者，我國的經濟，文有，等等，更不知將衰落得怎麼可憐呢？這便是綠衣使者的偉大處之三。</p>
<p>偉大哉，綠衣使老！綠衣使者，眞是我國歷史最久，而且是最努力的建設前鋒。</p>
<h3>典妻</h3>
<p>— 妙神</p>
<p>中國幾千年來的封建社會，一向沒有把女人看作一個人，女孩方從母胎中呱呱墮地，大家一聲歎息，便已决定了這女孩畢生的凄慘命運！女人始終是男人的附庸，當然囉，妻子是丈夫的附庸了。卽是一般女人自己的見解：也認爲嫁丈夫無非是嫁一個終身的靠山而已！因此有資格可以做人家靠山的，當然娶妻；到無力再做靠山的時候，這個依賴成性的妻，便有搖搖欲動之勢了</p>
<h3>萬般皆下品</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>不過，在上流社會，因有舊禮敎勢力的澎漲，妻子的心雖搖搖欲動，其如「十目所視，十手所指」，竟不敢有所異圖。祇有下流社會，因不受舊禮敎勢力的節制，便可爲所欲爲了，自己沒有力量做人家靠山，儘可讓妻去跟別人，至於妻子也不以一嫁再嫁爲恥，所以在下流社會中，出讓妻子的風氣，一向是很流行的。</p>
<p>在浙江東面一帶，還流行一種典妻的風俗，譬如本夫因無力贍養妻子，可以典給人家，一方面可以减輕擔負，一方面還可收進些錢。典與賣，當然不同，典妻必有期限，等期限滿了之後，自然還可贖還。有些人雖困於經濟，而夫婦情深，典了之後，藕斷絲連，自尚有破鏡重圓之日。典比賣自然好得多，不過在我們不常聽到的人聽來，不免有些異樣而已。至於受典的人，當然也是窮人囉！他無力娶妻，而又恐子嗣之中斷，費不了多少錢，典人家一位現成妻子，則在期限內所生的兒子，便可作爲傳種接代的香烟了。不過我們於這點上，當對於女人悲痛的際遇，更不勝其同情：女人是完全商品化了！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十四回　利重美人輕傖夫割愛　志高雙足健壯士投荒</p>
<p>張老漢站了靜靜的一聽，果然聽到那胡嫂子在院子裏喊叫，他道：錢會咬人的手嗎？這年月，有了錢就是貴人，沒有錢就是賤人。作姨太太要什麼緊？一不偷人家的，二不搶人家的，只憑了自己這條身子去投靠人家，混衣食飯碗，這有什麼要不得。哼！抗槍桿子當土匪去，將來還可以當司令呢。志前聽了，連連的點了幾點頭，還不曾留意，這位張老漢已不在面前，只聽到他在遠遠的嚷道。。我們西安人的臉，都給你丟盡了。你再要把那位姑娘弄走，我就去告你販賣人口。同時，也聽到胡嫂子回嘴，那聲音，就越走越遠了。志前把社會上的動態，向來是用客觀的眼睛去觀測，因爲如此，向不把人家的得失，放在自己的心上。可是今天的情形，有些奇怪，對於北海的事，總覺得有些不能妥貼。因之張老漢走了，張老漢的聲昔不聽到了，他兀自背了兩隻手在身後，不住的在屋子中間徘徊。走了一會，把背在身後的手，放到前面來，却用右手的拳頭，去打左手的手心：偏着頭，或者沉思一會，點點頭，或者又細想一會。有時也不排徊，坐下來倒一碗茶喝。可是，他把茶斟在茶杯子裹，並不端起來喝，只是空望着而已。這樣的躊躇不定，的莫有兩小時，倒有一個好消息來安慰他一下子，便是這院子裹的旅客，李士廉，他笑嘻嘻的走了進來了。志前對於他，向來持着一種看不起的態度，也就不歡迎他到屋子裹來談天。但是這時候他忽忽的進來了，也攔阻不得，只好照了平常的客套，對他笑着說請坐請坐。李士廉剛是在椅子上坐下，却叉站起來，連連的作了兩個揖道：我實在有一件事要和稈先生商量，不得不來。要不然，我也就不來打攪了。志前聽了這話，兩道眉頭子，恨不得就凑到一塊兒去，可是立刻也想到不應當得罪人家，便笑道：兄弟不懂得什麼，和兄弟商事情，就怕得不着要領的。（四一四）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （一震）</p>
<p>一天，我　早餐後，　着牙，注視着官外紛飛的雨雪，忽然有一種悲慘的斷叫聲傳來，我好奇心動，立刻　着雨雪走出家鬥，原來大岸上　着一個老婦人，伊正滾動着身子，滿身滿臉都是泥漿，那聲音正是伊的嘴巴裏發出來的。一邊立着一個猙獰可怕的　警，他職着大刀，正狠狠地這用皮鞋尖騙着那老婦人。駡着：「他辦的，狗種，你叫！」</p>
<p>這時，那　警踢得滿足了，用大刀唬了他一號。背着兩隻鹽袋走了。老婦人才放聲大哭。</p>
<p>我明瞭這是甚麼一回事，便走過去中慰伊。伊說伊的兒子病了，病得很利害，所以挑了　想賣幾個錢給病人使用，不想又——我見伊委實太可憐了，就遞給八毛錢，伊才停止了抽噎，撑起碎了的雨傘上鎭去。</p>
<p>我莫名地癡立在雨雪中，直至那可憐的人影消失了。</p>
<h3>燈籠</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>「燈籠殼子，一戳就穿」，這是我鄉諷刺一班外表塲面十足，其實裏面空虛的話兒。</p>
<p>據說：這燈籠殼子，是浙省特產，正像蠟燭芯子，一般的須向產地購來，加上一步手工，才得出售，燈籠的式樣：橢圓，長方，澎的，拗的都有，全出在做的人手裏，外行做不來的。</p>
<p>現在新時代裹，燈籠十足落伍了！都市中，除婚喪喜慶人家呆板使用一用，其餘那裏還有人問津。只有，我們鄉下，平日天天可以賞鑑得到，到了舊歷「歲暮」，喔唷！「××堂」，「××郡」紅字燈籠，點得着亮，用途正多：完年禮，齋家堂，送灶，接灶，接財神等，都少不來他。此外，大除夕，各家商店出來討帳，好演着一個「燈籠陣」，有時天色通明，明明用不着燈籠火，討帳人偏是還提着帶來帶去，據說：這暗示「你沒有大年夜，我沒有年初一」的意思。</p>
<p>我還記得小時候，逢到十二月廿四夜送灶，趣極哪！爸爸：鄭重其事，身穿元色緞子外套，足登厚底靴，頭舅紅緯帽子，好像做戲，在送的時候，眞好看！我和弟弟提了燈籠作嚮導，爸爸：拿一塊廿四糖，黏在灶君的嘴上，還哼着：「小囝平日騷擾得你不安，此番上天，總要請你包荒些哪！」爲狀可發一噱</p>
<p>各有千秋</p>
<h3>成人之興趣</h3>
<p>— 大千</p>
<p>美國哥倫比亞大學敎育學院敎授桑戴克氏，ProfEdward　L．Thorndike我國談敎育者類皆耳熟其名，近於其所著之「成人之興趣“Adult　Interests”」一書中發表其測騐六十四男婦老少所得之結果，以示成人之興趣，桑氏之問有趣，所答亦有趣，其允有趣者如下：</p>
<p>羞惡之心人皆有之桑問：「若有人願出重賞，在紐約大馬路及四十二道街口，（按係紐約極繁盛之區）赤手勒死一大雄貓，或砍一豬頭，汝須給領賞若干，乃肯爲之？（按此問係對紐約人之有財產體面者而發）答案男爲二萬五千元，（美金以下準此）女須十萬零五千元，男女體力膽量不同，故所要求有若是之相差，但屬有財產體面者無人願失次體面，則顯而易見，以下諸問，無男女之限，更可以見興趣之眞矣。</p>
<p>惻隱之心亦人皆有之　桑問：「若有人以煮熟之人肉四兩，要汝進食，汝須受賞若干，乃肯爲之？若有新聞記者在旁攝影，汝須索賞若干？」答案大相懸殊，最少男須一，千元，女須五千元以上，男子組之平均數的爲五萬元，如若任人摒影宜傳，則須二千五百萬元；女子在隱蔽處食人肉，大率須七十五萬元，但若當衆行之，亦不過略多於百萬元云。</p>
<p>穢蟲較人肉爲易食　桑問：「若有人懸賞令人食穢蟲，如大臭蟲或長六寸左右之蚯蚓等，汝須若干，乃肯爲之？若穢蟲爲已死者，則須若干乃肯爲之？」結果女子多掉頭不願置答，若認爲不可能，男子則得四千元即願爲之，已死之蟲加倍。數月以前，美國密西西比省曾有女子名爲摩頭者，以被一飲料公司用一不潔之水瓶藏水，誤吞六蠅，訴之法院，判公司償女損失每蠅五百元，故茲男子所索之賞，尙不免失之過高。</p>
<p>母親照片之價値　桑問：「若有人懸賞欲汝唾於汝母親之照片及達爾文華盛頓等照片上，汝須若干乃肯爲之？答案男子須二萬五千元，女子須五十萬元，若達頭文華盛頓等照片，則男子得三十元，女子得二十元，即願爲之矣。本條答案，女子所索唾於其母照片上之代價，二十倍於男子，似女子之愛母，過於男子，惜尙不敵愛錢何！</p>
<p>女腿遠較男腿爲賤　桑問：「若有人懸賞募施割一腿或一臂，汝須若干乃肯爲之？」，男子之答案須數萬萬元，女子則僅索此數之十份之一，若失一臂，則雖僅二十份之一亦願爲之。美國女子以腿爲其體美之一部，在舞台匕每露演之，絕不聞有人願見舞台上男子之粗壯毛腿，故男子亦絕不敢一露演之，意者女子之腿，必遠較男子爲貴，乃其自索之價值適相反，且大相懸殊，殊出意外。</p>
<p>敎堂尊嚴祗値十五元錢　桑問：「若有人令汝在敎堂中正當行禮時作怪囂，汝須若干乃肯爲之？」一少婦答僅須十五元，其餘諸人所索之代價，亦遠較在大街殺豬爲賤，是可以覘美國人對於敎堂之信念矣。</p>
<p>崇拜英雄勝於愛美　桑問：「若因與羅斯福總統，史丹林，墨索里尼，加波（著名電影女明星）談話半日而入獄，汝須於拘留不超過若干時之條件下乃肯爲之？」結果少年男子，大多願以四日監禁與史丹林相談，半日與墨索里尼相談，七分之一日與加波相談；少年女子願以一日監禁與羅斯福相談，兩日半與史丹林相談，一日半與墨索里尼相談，三分之一日與加波一相見；老年男子願以三日半監禁與羅斯福相談，兩日與史丹林相談，十分之一日與加波相談；老年婦人則願以半日監禁與羅斯福相談，九日與史塔林相談，八日與墨索里尼相談，而竟無一老婦願以監禁易與加波相談。我國成語有「苦口婆心」一句，似婆心應和平，茲者老婦愛英雄，殊非所料者矣。</p>
<p>以上諸趣聞，殆無不均可以錢爲解决，雖未必答者即是能行者，而芸芸衆人之心理，於此可見一斑，錢是萬能，亦於此可信，不知此諸趣聞若移諸我國，其答案又當若何？</p>

<h3>靑年通病婚前速治</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵</p>
<p>手淫惡癖。靑年難免。遺精夢洩。成爲通病。設延不治療。則精薄腦弱。病變百出。失去健康。壽命夭促。生機已喪。子嗣無望。結婚行房。均非所宜。吾則生殖腺愈頹廢。早洩腎痿。將更陷入衰弱莫堪也。</p>

<h3>戒烟安全首重治病</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>戒烟之法甚多。如安眠。發泡。抗毒。代替。血淸。變質。抽血皆是也。而允以培補戒法爲最安全。然培補之劑不一。要以有病治病。無病强身爲要。生殖腺製劑俱備上述功用。故爲安全戒烟之無上妙劑。洵戒烟聲中黑籍男女同胞之福屋也。</p>
<h3>（來函照登）胃痛經痛安全戒烟</h3>
<p>（殷培元夫人來函云）余秉賦素薄。柔弱多病。先罹經痛。後患胃痛。痛苦難堪。遂致吸烟成癮。迭决求戒。均以痛患交作。難收全功。去秋以禁令所迫。不容再延。始投函本刋。乞求治法。承編者作答。介紹太和藥房購服「女用生殖素「及「胃痛靈」「健胃素」等三大名藥。依法餌服。胃痛旣吿根治。經來亦不腹痛。且精神煥發。身體壯健。烟毒消除。見烟自厭。爲期四星期左右。烟癮吿斷。克奏安全之功云。</p>

<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>手淫斵喪。房勞過度。生殖腺首當其衝。一再摧殘。形成萎頹。腎痿早洩性病。遂致紛起。息者不惟身體衰弱。且生機喪失。夫職難盡。腎虧精薄。子嗣無望。治療之法。內服生殖腺製劑最效。如欲迅速求瘳。則可兼就著名之性病專家施行電療。則生機重萌。夫職不虧。育麟可期。</p>
<p>最近有羗巨川君來函云。前因昧於保養之理。過度新喪。致罹腎痿早洩等症。百計求治。未奏全效。結婚多年。夫職難盡。遑論子嗣。後投性病專家詹念曾醫師處診治。承施電療。並囑向太和藥房購服「生殖素」名藥。生機頓萌。回復壯健。性病消失。重整夫職。現內子已懷孕多月。足見名醫名藥再造之功。不亞於送子慈航云。</p>
<h3>白帶－子宮炎症</h3>
<p>— 任國祥</p>
<p>白帶一症。概由炎症而起。就其炎症之部位而言之。乃有子宮體白帶。前庭白帶。頸管白帶。陰道白帶等之分。而以子宮炎症引起之白帶患者最多。</p>
<p>本症治法。當內外並重。內服健宮去炎之女性生殖腺製劑。外用乳酸菌膣桿菌肝澱粉合製品。則內外兼施。不論其炎症之部位何在。白帶卽可凈絕。</p>
<p>如王行鉞夫人者。罹有白帶纏綿及月經失調等症。以致久婚不育。翁姑夫婿。交相指摘。去年自投函本刋。求示治法。卽遵覆向中西藥房指購「女用生殖素」內服。並外用「療帶靈」。後接其謝函云。已行秘密自療。匝月而愈。不惟經調帶凈。且身體獲得從來未有之健美云。</p>
<p>（按）「療帶靈」以乳酸菌膣桿菌及肝澱粉爲主劑。故對於白帶外用。克奏美滿之特效也。用法。隔晚納膣內一片至二片。異常簡便。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>如此文明</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>意國飛機最近在阿國境內未佔領地帶散發傳單，誘勸阿人歸順，謂「我們到此，係以文明畀予你們，使你們享富足繁榮。」這話講得很漂亮！曾有意軍官向人聲稱；「意國負有維持世界文明的任務，現時意軍對阿作戰，目的卽爲實行這任務。」又有意著作家也說過：「五十年來，意國對於阿國，雖竭盡心力，使之躋於文明之域，但竟爲該國所拒絕，今决意國出兵東菲，立意亦不外乎是，自有理由可據。」看來意國的征服阿國，倒不算是侵略，而是爲「文明」而戰的！</p>
<p>意國是「文朋國」，不但意國以此自豪，全世界也這樣公認。阿國呢？無疑是個「野蠻國」，至少在意人看來。所以這决意國爲「實行維持世界文明的任務，」爲「使阿國躋於文明之域，」爲「以文明畀予阿國人，」便不得不從歐洲派遣大軍到菲洲去。要是阿對於意國這種善意，能充分理解，以簞食壺漿相迎，低首下心的接受意國所賜予的文明，當不至遭到這一塲的慘殺。不幸阿國人却不願「享富足繁榮」，蠻性不改，敢於抵禦，於是意國只好施用武力，來傳播它的文明。這結果，阿人所受意國的文明禮物，就是飛機的轟炸，和坦克車的衝擊！正像勸降傳單中所說：「你們若能張臂歡迎，視我們如良友，房屋敎堂以及　拏，我們自當秋毫無犯，若不然，則大兵一至，玉石俱焚。」</p>
<p>這便是意國所表現出來的文明！近日意軍大獲勝利，傾城陷地，進迫阿京。一方稱爲國際「和平機構」的國聯，亦在延緩油禁之下，進行和解方策。旦聞意阿雙方，皆有接受和解的表示。四個月來的戰爭，或可吿一結束。今後戰敗的阿國，不免耍割地求和。我們且看意國在野心滿足之後，將如何來宣揚它的文明！</p>
<p>不過侵略國總有許多藉口，如「友邦」的壓迫我國，其野蠻行爲，也不减於意國的對付阿國。然意國不但不承認爲野蠻，還說是要宣揚文明。「友邦」却又是怎樣說法呢？先日有個「友邦」的武官，向外國記者發表談話，稱「此來係站在文化的立塲，謀東亞的和平。」原來「友邦」幾年來調動大軍，踐踏我土，倒是爲「和平」而出此的！怪不得至今「親善提携」之聲，不絕於耳！</p>
<p>然而這便能掩蓋它們的醜惡嗎？</p>
<h3>搬家</h3>
<p>— 許人桀</p>
<p>燈下，丈夫讀完了常天的新聞紙，到後房更換了寢衣出來的時候，對他年輕的妻子說：</p>
<p>「近來我的記憶力眞是太壞了。我沒有說過嗎？昨天看到一所更適合的住宅呢。」</p>
<p>年輕的妻子半躺在床上，開着床頭的小電燈，滿意地讀着一冊愛情小說。小說里的主人是一對年靑夫婦，他們結婚後快活地度着歲月。一天，他們從咖啡店里出來，偶然買了一條航空獎券，却中了二獎。當丈夫從銀行里領了獎金回來，他們互相擁抱着接吻的時候，妻子發現丈夫的西裝小口袋上有一顆菱形的朱印，</p>
<p>年輕的妻子讀到這里的時候，她下意識地抬起頭來瞧她沙發椅里的丈夫，但是丈夫已慢慢地走近床前來了，接着說：</p>
<p>「你是主婦，明天應該親自去看看。」</p>
<p>雖然丈夫已經換上寢衣，妻子的目光還是注意着他的小口袋。她仿佛沒有聽見丈夫的話。</p>
<p>然而丈夫誤會了妻子的意思，俯下頭來親熱地吻了妻子的前額，說：「你估量我又欺騙你嗎？」</p>
<p>妻子馬上聰明地接着说：</p>
<p>「你今天看房子去的嗎？」</p>
<p>丈夫佯怒着奪去了她手里的小說，「我明天去定歲種雜誌你看，這種小說專門寫些愛呵肉呵，不是？…我說看上了一所住宅，在亞爾培路什麽路口，一所小洋房，房租相當便宜，四十兩。你明天要去看看嗎？」</p>
<p>妻子因爲住不慣一樓一底的住宅，她常扭着丈夫撒嬌，她要住小洋房，有一個小花園。早上，在花聞里早餐，晚上，到花園里散步，却是最合於衛生的。她舉着她的同學做例，誰住在環龍路，誰住在辣斐德路，都是小洋房，有花園的。她的最大的意思是住一樓一底太顯得寒酸。</p>
<p>但是丈夫敎書的那個學校常鬧着欠薪，在付不出房租的時候，他總是把公事皮包摔着要改行。所以，他雖懂得妻子的意思，衹溫柔地敷衍着妻子，他有那末多的書，搬一决家總是弄得七零八落，况且，搬一决家是多麼麻煩，到這里來的時候，不費上半個多月嗎？</p>
<p>最近丈夫活動到一筆什麼公費，他告訴妻子要搬家了。但是他又忙着應酬，常常到午夜才回家。前天晚上，這一對年輕夫婦口角了：妻子說他不應該欺騙她，她要回到母家去了。丈夫着了慌，第二天就去看上了一所小洋房，但是回家的時候，妻子已睡熟了，今天又忙着兩個飯局，到這時候才想起。</p>
<p>「亞爾培路什麼路口呢？」妻子笑了「該又是欺騙我！」丈夫更溫柔地握了妻子的手，「那路名我眞忘了。－我的記憶力太壞了。不過亞爾培路祇有這樣一所紅瓦的小洋房，我記得很淸楚的。」他遲疑了一下，可是我明天沒有空</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>我國最近失業人數，據國際勞工局中國分局發表，達五百八十餘萬人之多。譚老三日，此僅據已經得業復失業者而言，若未曾得業而希望得業者，恐亦倍於此數，故無業者而使其有業，失業者而使其復業，這是國家第一件大功。</p>
<p>德國希特勒元首，頃通令全國，於歐戰陣亡將士紀念日，一律懸掛新國旗，新旗係黑白紅三色。譚老三日，前日德國某靑年繫紅領結，地方當局；卽認其爲共產思想的表示，判處徒刑六月，現在國旗亦有紅色，則有何說。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，不然陪着你去。」</p>
<p>妻子輕輕地打着丈夫的肩頭說：「誰要你陪着去呢？——那本書還我，我要看完了睡呢。」</p>
<p>下一天丈夫回家又是午夜了。他一面脫大衣一面問妻子：「那洋房不是很好嗎？」</p>
<p>妻子却是突如其來的　着嘴唇：「房東不是也住在里面嗎？我不要！」</p>
<p>「那有什麽關係呢，隔着一個花園的。而且房東是個寡婦呢。」</p>
<p>妻子從床上跳了起來，抓着丈夫的肩頭連連搖着：「我問你，這一向你到底幹着什麽事，每天半夜三更回來？」</p>
<p>丈夫茫然地注視着妻子的臉。</p>
<p>「好好的又發脾氣了，我明天陪着你再去找。」</p>
<p>妻子凑着燈光，銳利地檢査着丈夫的小口袋，但是什麽都沒有，而丈夫却溫柔地抱着她陪小心。</p>
<p>「隨你的便罷」！妻子在丈夫懷里笑了起來。</p>
<h3>娜拉（八）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作畫　忻炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉：我們結婚後的第一年，他操勞得很過度，他不得不去尋各種額外的事情做，一天到晚辛苦不休。後來他受不住了，害起很重的病來，醫生都說他定要往南方去才會好。我們在意大利住了一年。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：那是我曉得的。你們旅行的費用是你父親供給的。</p>
<p>娜拉：（含笑）不錯，滔佛和旁人都以為是這樣的，但是，但是我父親一個大錢也不曾給過我們，籌劃那筆欵子的並不是別人，就是我。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：是你？那樣一注大欵子統統都是？娜拉，我實在不明白！</p>
<p>娜拉：你要曉得我很費了一些心血。準期付欵這件事，並不是好頑的。所以我不得不各處去東拚西凑一點，有時候滔佛給我錢，敎我添置衣飾，我從來不肯把錢花過一半！去年冬天我運氣好，替人家鈔寫，到夜深　歇，有時候，我疲乏得不了，但是這樣做工賺錢，究竟是快活的，我覺得我很像個男子似的。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：那麽，你的債，究竟還淸了多少了？</p>
<p>娜拉：那很難說，我祗知道我能搜括來的錢都還了債了。但是現在已經沒有關係，我的艱苦已經過去了。</p>

<h3>靑陽港的初冬（十四）</h3>
<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>太陽已經有點西斜了，他們從鐵路飯店走了出來，在　野上的徑道上走着，走過了三五的鄉村人家，蹈過幾頂獨木的渡橋，走，走上了錫滬公路，跨上了那橫越的靑陽港的大橋；秋風一陣陣地吹着，吹着秋華的粽黃的頭髮，雖然不是春風，在這十月的小陽春的天氣，這初冬的春天，已足夠使人沈醉了。當他們跨越了這條靑陽港，循着小道，走到靑陽港站的時候，已經是暮色沈沈了。車子還沒有到，他們在橋上的欄杆上坐着，談着，也不知道這什麽世界，除了他們倆以外。</p>
<p>——眞的，Forever　youro了嗎？</p>
<p>——可不是，有生命的一天，這生命全是為了你，Dians　　吿訴我，你永遠愛我。</p>
<p>——要不是，假如沒有愛，你知道！</p>
<p>——那你知道，這樣大的世界，我們在那兒呢？</p>
<p>卓民抱住了秋華，深了地吻了一下，又一下，趕到火車站買上票，火車已　快開到了。上了車，用他的右手　　秋華的腰，　行重行地　　車行駛　，秋華也閉上了眼睛。在北站下了車，用了徐緩的脚步，走出了站：</p>
<p>——我們好像作了一次蜜月旅行那麽的回來。</p>
<p>——可不是？</p>
<p>——我們幾時還可以再去。（完）</p>

<p>程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書</p>
<p>華美（一〇六〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇　「自由結婚」</p>
<p>社交解放學文明。媒妁無須好訂婚。他是誤解自由把輕薄學。同窗異性托終身。有的是家中已娶糟糠婦。他是，棄舊憐新更訂盟。有的是，微逐情場戀三角愛。到頭各自誤前程。有的是，相逢初次涎垂地。跪着求婚假淚零。有的是，妾愛郎情偷贈戒。若談身世等　萍。有的是，父兄十弟都瞞着。垂老貪花竟誤用情。有的是，獅吼推翻婚約券。要求撫養控重婚。總算是，自由兩字把終身誤。累得那，月老奔波錯認人。要曉得，多情自古空餘恨。好夢由來最易醒。為人莫辜負好靑春。</p>
<p>蔡筱舫果報錄</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇　「宋江」</p>
<p>梁山大盜宋公明。招集紛紛亡命人。甚致於，奪庫戕官傷士卒。打家刦舍據鄉村。况且那，三十六人無賴者。山東河朔敢橫行。替天行道是欺人語。姑待招安穩眾心。偏遇着，官兵捕盜無功績。端只為，眾散無常不易尋。當日裏，徽欽二帝俱無道。用這班，童貫高俅與蔡京。滿朝盡　弄權臣。人心到處難平服。並起帬雄盜弄兵。雖則跳梁皆小醜。烽烟四起欠調停。民窮財盡無糧餉。草寇些須不認眞。大帥幸逢張叔夜。本來他，六韜三略智謀深。竟能　，一夜工夫盡蕩平。到後來，全部著成水滸傳。耐菴施老的妙才情。無中生有虛中實。譜出天罡地煞星。想入非非眞可愛。凑齊一百又八人。妙不過，強盜終歸段景住。還有那，及時好雨送江心。寓意精微極有因。賞格曾懸幾萬貫。故所以，紙牌藉此做輸贏。但不知，長弓短箭何人射。疑假疑眞張字形。梁山結局夢驚醒。</p>
<p>邢瑞亭三笑</p>
<p>華東（一三六〇）下午四時至四時三刻</p>
<p>開篇　「張敞書眉」</p>
<p>京兆風流　事多。　房　日　銷磨。他是晨妝眉樣商量畫。費盡工夫研十斛螺。綵筆題詩雙管　。催妝麗旬共吟哦。硯多餘瀋把羊毫蘸。欲畫那，新月灣灣意若何。深淺間郎時樣否。更翻眉譜盡雙蛾。有的是，月稜寳相翻新樣。有的是，淡淡眉峯淡欲無。有的是，柳葉抽芽差可比。有的是，黛痕新點十眉圖。便把那，綵　銅鏡回眸照。細細雙眉刻意摹。侵曉並肩撞袖畫。碧紗窗下更把頭梳。初不料，春光混漏聞天語。艷屑流傳伉儷和。夫唱婦隨嘉藕配。千秋佳話漢家多。艷記妝台譜于夜歌。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>某報載：「在「春××」中，本有一你瞧！這廣大的公司，會欠你的嗎！」之幽默對白，現聞亦已奉張老大石川之命剪去。使人讀後，不勝剪刀剪刀之嘆。</p>
<p>（子曰：這段消息勿曉得阿是宣傳科「傳」出來的？）</p>
<p>宣傳稿經導演科檢查，據說是「深知世故人情的新猷」，所以「其他各影片公司的吃宣傳飯者，似乎大可仿行。」</p>
<p>讓我再加上一句，如果行之有功，「各影片公司的吃宣傳飯者」，廣該不要忘記該發明人吳「早茶」先生，至少，千秋萬歲之後，也應該鑄一尊銅像來紀念紀念。</p>
<p>（子曰：徐來要二千塊拍「金××」好像並不是正式的宣傳稿。）</p>
<p>明星空傳稿須導演科審查的辦法實行後有一部份科員已拒絕撰宣傳稿。</p>
<p>（子曰：可是半月刊封面還可以自由支配。）</p>
<p>據說「早茶」先生因上任伊始時所說的「我是開口的好先生」一番談話有些未妥，故有否認之意。據我看來，也的確「大有發「書面談話」之必要」，因爲這樣才顯得官派也。</p>
<p>老滕，咱們心照不宣。</p>
<p>（子曰：因爲揚子之言猶在耳旁乎？？）</p>
<h3>最初的歐羅巴之旗</h3>
<p>在這困難繁重之時機中，戲劇家們似乎也應起來作一點工作，前些時曾宣傳排演的反帝名劇「最初的歐羅巴之旗，」據今天消息，上海戲劇電影研究所已決定於最近開始排演。該所第二屆新生上課爲本月十五日，聞於日內加緊籌備此劇之一切，已備十五日之後卽開始工作，聞這次演出時間約在下月中旬，工作人員及演員，約於日內卽可公佈云。</p>

<h3>聯華花絮</h3>
<p>吳永剛，爲今日銀壇導演隊中兩起之最優秀人才，近其任作「浪淘沙」經已完成十分之八。聯華攝製之全部對白有聲片中，將以此片首與全國人士相見，該片非但爲聯華聲片之第一次鉅製，且爲吳永剛與金燄初度合作者有最大成功之作品云。</p>
<p>「迷途的羔羊」，頗爲嗜影者所矚目，全片即將蕆事，可繼「浪淘沙」之後獻映。</p>
<p>寶穆本年準備作更大之努力，此一年中，將以全力導演兩大新片，其已定者爲「幼年中國」，另一新片劇本業經選就，一俟籌備竣事，即行開攝。</p>
<p>吳永剛繼「浪淘沙」後之新作，聞係以學校做背景，寫大學生故事。</p>
<p>楊小仲放棄「野貓」，仍拍三戰士，現正從事分幕。</p>
<p>「到自然去」中所需用之道具，多爲非常之品，而男女員服裝，尤多時式而質料珍貴之物，計該片所用於男女賞服裝之置費，在聯華已破最高之紀錄。</p>
<p>黎莉莉，徐健，龔智華，於「到自然去」中扮十足貴州氣之三姊妹。這三位小姐的生活，可謂驕奪得盡致，即此三位小姐所穿用各式各標之高跟鞋，若陳列一室，直如　女鞋店也。</p>
<p>「浪淘沙」中，溫容扮　嗜酒之水手，醉後大唱「妓女告狀」。按此小調甚盛行於北方之天津。</p>
<p>「慈母曲」扮女敎授之黃篤貞，近日努力學國主，陳燕燕爲其義務敎師。</p>
<p>聯華近拳之鸚鵡，近在「到自然雲」中上鏡頭，此鸚鵡亦能學人語，如「預備，開麥拉」皆能道之。現經孟君謀循循敎導，已能喚「韓蘭根」名，日前爲韓聞，韓當指鸚鵡笑曰：「聽牠道小嘴兒喚我，有說不出來的一種美感，只可惜牠不能對我笑一笑。——」</p>

<h3>Sufficiency of Food is the Most Urgent Task</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since Germany announced the abandonment of the Locarno Pact and marched troops into the Rhineland, the economic world has been greatly shocked. Military stocks in New York have soared, the British and French exchange rates have changed suddenly, the price of silver has soared, and the price of gold has fallen. Even my Shanghai miscellaneous grain market has been rife with speculation, and people are panicking. Some say that China today relies on foreign countries for almost all materials. Without the supply of oil beans from the Northeast, the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry has little room for development. Without the import of foreign wheat, flour mills cannot continue their work. Without the import of foreign rice, the people will starve. Therefore, if the situation changes, the response of the Shanghai market is like a swift echo. It is not yet known whether there will be war in Europe, but the market has already changed like this. If it is realized, or even if there are incidents on China's borders, sea transport is interrupted, foreign goods cannot be imported, and domestic resources cannot be circulated, then the panic of the people and the turmoil of the market will be extremely serious. Therefore, what China urgently needs today is to have sufficient food. In other words, food reserves should be abundant and prepared for contingencies. They can be used for regulation in peacetime and used for preparation in wartime. Sun Tzu said, "An army without baggage is lost, without food is lost, without stockpiles is lost." The advantage of using troops lies in "taking from the people and taking food from the enemy," so there is no suffering of "distant transport and a poor army." If the people have no food and the soldiers have no food, they can collapse without fighting. Some say that last year's harvest was abundant and there was a surplus, and this year's people's food should be worry-free. It is important to know that the truth of the matter is not so. Moreover, even if there is a surplus, it should be purchased in time to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. It is also pleasing that there are very few imports of foreign rice, but it is not known that this is because the converted price of foreign rice is expensive and does not meet the requirements for sales. If the price of retired rice is cheap, there will be transactions. Moreover, the price of japonica rice is also at 11.45 yuan (equivalent to more than 13 yuan per old load). If it becomes more expensive, foreign rice will come uninvited. If the self-owned rice is almost exhausted and a famine strikes, and it is difficult to sustain life with grain, then even if foreign rice is expensive, people will compete for it. The scene of the Republic of China in 1918 and 1919 can serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I believe that for the sake of the people's food at present, our people should have a deep understanding of the current situation of food and adopt effective measures to prevent panic in the people's food this year. For the sake of the people's food in the future, we should discuss the production and self-sufficiency methods. This year's spring is very cold, and the wheat is suitable for cold weather, but there is still some damage. Broad beans and vegetables have been greatly reduced. The spring harvest is used to support the food of farmers in spring and summer. If the harvest is poor, the impact will be very great. The production of rice and grain is not progressing because water and drought take their place, and insect pests are often seen. Farmers are bankrupt and have no funds to fertilize. If irrigation is not promoted and insect pests are not eliminated, all farmers will have the opportunity to borrow to support agriculture, and production will not increase. If the people of the country can exert their ability to improve agriculture and make food barely self-sufficient, then when there is an emergency, the people's hearts will be stable and able to cope with it easily.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Right-Wingers Involved in the Tokyo Incident Were Also Investigated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, the fierce riots of February 26 in Japan were on the surface violent acts by young soldiers, but the situation behind them was quite complicated. Many right-wing groups and their leaders also participated in this riot. The Tokyo Garrison Command and the Metropolitan Police Department cooperated and began a general investigation on March 11. More than 150 Japanese right-wing theorists, including Kita Ikki, Nishida Zei, and Nakamura Sakuma, have been investigated and are currently being seriously interrogated by the military police and the Metropolitan Police Department. Furthermore, the scope of the victims of this failed riot will be quite wide. (10th - China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Declares to the House of Commons Promotion of Anglo-French-German Friendship, Easing International Disturbance, Guaranteeing League of Nations Covenant, Hoare Says Hitler's Actions Were a Great Mistake</h3>
<p>London - When British Prime Minister Baldwin began the debate in the House of Commons on the government's White Paper on national defense, he stated that the purpose of British foreign policy was to seek peace for the British Empire and the people of all countries. The repeated efforts of the International Disarmament Conference had resulted in disappointing outcomes, and the gradual expansion of armaments in other countries had left Britain with no choice but to strengthen its national defense in order to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant and safeguard itself. The Prime Minister spoke of the crisis caused by Germany's recent abolition of the Locarno Treaty, saying that if suspicion existed between France and Germany for one day, then permanent peace in Europe could not exist for one day.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister's speech, Labor Party leader Attlee proposed a motion to impeach the government's policy, saying that the White Paper only showed that Britain was engaged in an arms race. Labor Party members were prepared to establish the national defense necessary for collective security, but not to go any further. Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that the White Paper was vague and lacked clarity. He abhorred the destruction of treaties, but felt that Hitler's constructive proposals should be studied calmly.</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Hoare spoke of Germany's actions in the Rhineland, saying that he believed Germany's move was a great mistake and could even be called a crime. However, he did not want to use abusive language. He believed that Germany's move shook the foundation of international treaties. Therefore, he agreed with Eden's statement that even Germany's best friends could not recognize Germany as the sole cause of the current European problems and Britain's defense program. He thought that all members of the House of Commons would think so as well.</p>
<p>When Baldwin rose to speak, there was not a single empty seat in the House of Commons, and it was extremely crowded. The Prime Minister first described the purpose of the White Paper, and then said that although the government had failed repeatedly, it still hoped to obtain a basis for concluding a disarmament agreement. He had said this at the end of last week's events, and he repeated it again today, believing that the government's purpose was that national defense was not only tied to Britain's foreign policy, but also to the foreign policies of other countries. War could be started by one country, but peace required the efforts of fifteen countries. The British government should continue to use its authority and power to ease international unrest and guarantee the success of the League of Nations principles. However, the British government could not ignore the danger of war elsewhere, nor could it ignore the consequences of Britain's participation in the League of Nations. On the one hand, it should try to avoid disputes, and on the other hand, it must not evade its necessary responsibilities, nor must it be willing to leave its country without a strong and fully equipped national defense. Britain must maintain its inherent freedom, completely intact. He was convinced that the government could not stop an aggressor from waging war unless the aggressor knew that if a war broke out, it would face armed resistance. Europe could not yet say this. The entire element of modern warfare was surprise. A country that prepared ahead of time was in a stronger position than a country that made repairs after the fact. Members of the House of Commons may have had different feelings about Eden's remarks, but no one did not wish him success in his travels to Paris and Geneva. If France and Germany continued to distrust each other, how could there be permanent peace in Europe? France wanted security, and Germany wanted equality. Their best hopes had repeatedly ended in failure, sometimes because France missed the opportunity to accept a proposal, and sometimes because Germany took actions that destroyed treaties and shocked people's hearts. The only hope now was to achieve a triangular friendship between Germany, France, and Britain. If this were not the case, then Europe would ultimately be unable to escape an era of crisis and panic.</p>
<p>Colonial Secretary Thomson rose to speak, ending the first day of debate, saying that one or two speakers had even said that a major war would break out within a month, which was a bit of a nervous reaction. As for the attitude of the Dominions towards the White Paper, the entire national defense situation had been explained to the representatives of the Dominions during the celebration of King George's 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne. Since then, the contents of the White Paper had also been completely conveyed to the Dominions. Everyone was unanimous, not only tacitly acknowledging it, but also feeling that this was a policy that should be supported. The Dominions supported the collective security measures of the League of Nations member states and participated in the various steps taken by the British government, and some even took their own measures to strengthen their defenses. The colonies also expressed their willingness to contribute to the general defense preparations of the British Empire. The debate was then adjourned until today, when a vote could be taken at 11:00 a.m. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Eden's Speech</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke in the House of Commons today, denouncing Germany's unilateral abolition of the Locarno Treaty and announcing the British government's attitude towards this development. He said that on March 6, he had asked the German Ambassador to Britain to come to the Foreign Office to inform him of the proposal notified to the German government by the British Ambassador to Germany on December 13, advocating negotiations on an air pact among the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty. The British government believed that the conclusion of this treaty could be a stabilizing element in relations between the three major Western powers. On March 7, the German Ambassador came to the Foreign Office again to claim that he had received a very important document, and then handed over a memorandum. The British Foreign Secretary pointed out the important points in the memorandum to the German Ambassador and told him that he could not make a detailed statement until he had the opportunity to study the document and consider the new situation with his colleagues. At the same time, he also told the German Ambassador that he deeply regretted hearing about the German government's actions in the demilitarized zone and thought that the German Ambassador should also consider this act equivalent to a unilateral cancellation of a freely agreed treaty. He certainly knew the German government's views on the impact of the Franco-Russian treaty, but the other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty did not hold this view. If the German government ignored the views of the other signatory countries and still held its own judgment, then it could submit to arbitration. He feared that the unilateral abolition of the treaty would have a significant impact on public opinion in the British government and the public. When he met with the German Ambassador, he referred to the latter part of the German letter and told him that the British government would consider it, but felt that the declaration on Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations was most important. The German Ambassador then said that the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary had repeatedly stated that the British government's policy was based on the League of Nations and collective security. The German government welcomed this view, which was why it had made this decision regarding the League of Nations. Germany was willing to participate in this policy and did not have any conditions for re-entering the League of Nations. Although the German government hoped that the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles would be separated in the future, and that the issue of colonial rights would also be resolved, this was not a condition, but merely a matter for negotiations on Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations.</p>
<p>After recounting the situation of his meeting with the German Ambassador, Eden continued his speech, saying that the importance of the German letter was self-evident. He could now tell the House of Commons that the French government had obtained the full agreement of the British government and had requested the League of Nations Council to convene immediately to consider this situation. The League of Nations Council was the appropriate body to deal with this matter. It was heard that the Council was scheduled to meet on Friday. In the absence of a meeting, of course, no decision could be made. However, the four signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, excluding Germany, would exchange views in Paris tomorrow and continue these talks in Geneva the day after tomorrow. The British representatives participating in these talks would be the Lord Privy Seal and himself. The House of Commons would, of course, wish to know immediately the ideas and intentions that the British representatives were holding when they went to Geneva to deal with this issue. This was the right thing to do, because everyone should understand that Britain was now a clear, unified, and stable force of public opinion in European affairs. Let us not deceive ourselves. The German government's unilateral abolition of its freely recognized obligations and its disregard for them had made the international situation increasingly entangled and serious. The abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the occupation of the demilitarized zone had shaken the credibility of any treaties that the German government might conclude in the future. No one in this House or in this country would condone such steps, because they had dealt a major blow to the principle of treaty dignity on which the entire structure of international relations depended. He was fortunate to say that there was no reason to believe that Germany's current actions contained any hostile threats, because the German government had stated in its memorandum its unchangeable hope for a genuine peace in Europe and expressed its willingness to conclude non-aggression pacts with France and Belgium. However, if anyone had any misunderstanding about Britain's position as a signatory country to the Locarno Treaty, the British government believed it was necessary to state that if France and Belgium were attacked during the period necessary for considering the new situation, thereby violating Article 2 of the Locarno Treaty, then even if Germany did not recognize this treaty, the British government would consider it a matter of honor and would certainly come to the defense of the attacked country in the form prescribed by this treaty. In the current environment, turning a bad past into a better future was a difficult task. This must be generally known. Now that one of the main foundations of peace in Western Europe had collapsed, it was our heavy responsibility to rebuild this foundation in order to restore peace. We must now deal with Germany's new proposals in this spirit. The British government would now thoroughly study them in order to ascertain to what extent its recommendations could consolidate the foundation of peace that had been shaken. In the current serious state of international events, the British government felt that any opportunity that might have hope for improvement should not be missed. He believed he had reason to ask the various parties in the House of Commons to support the government in dealing with the difficult events that must be dealt with with global wisdom and political skill.

<h3>The League of Nations Considers Eden's Declaration a Soothing Force, French Figures Are Half For and Half Against</h3>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations today interpreted British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons as a soothing force in the crisis caused by Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and the new troop deployment in the Rhineland. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, explaining Britain's position on Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty. Political figures here commented on the speech, expressing satisfaction with Eden's condemnation of unilateral abrogation, but regretted that Eden did not mention that, according to the Locarno Treaty, the re-establishment of fortifications in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland should be regarded as equivalent to an act of actual aggression. Furthermore, in view of Eden's speech, Britain was now prepared to consider the proposals put forward by Germany, which had already been explicitly rejected in France, thereby showing that the attitudes of Britain and France were clearly different. Responsible parties believed that since Britain was a guarantor of the Locarno Treaty, it could not hold the same views as France, which was being guaranteed. Therefore, before the League of Nations Council made a decision, Britain was willing to adopt an objective attitude, which was only natural. However, responsible parties also said that France might be able to conduct negotiations with Germany, but only on the following two conditions: 1. German troops withdraw from the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland; 2. A conference is held under the auspices of the League of Nations. If an agreement is concluded with Germany in the future, it should be guaranteed by a third country. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here. In general, it is said that some sections of the speech are completely satisfactory to France, but some sections are empty. It is said that Eden's original draft was revised during the cabinet meeting yesterday morning. The 事業報 (Business Daily) reported that Eden's original draft was personally revised by Prime Minister Baldwin. "The Prime Minister also sent Lord Halifax, the former Secretary of War, who is known to be pro-German, to assist Eden in future negotiations with Germany in order to mediate", as Eden himself is a staunch supporter of the League of Nations. The newspaper also claimed that Belgian Prime Minister Janson met with Foreign Minister Flandin shortly after arriving here yesterday evening and told the Foreign Minister that Belgium would act in concert with France, meaning that negotiations could not be conducted until German troops had withdrawn from the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London - The speech delivered by Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons today was unanimously approved by members of both the majority and opposition parties. His remarks were interrupted by unanimous cheers and cries of "Hear, hear!" a total of two resolutions. One resolution stated that "Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and the deployment of troops in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland have fundamentally shaken the credibility of the German government in fulfilling international obligations." The other resolution stated that "in the event of an act of aggression, the British government is still willing to abide by its promises, respect the treaty, and assist France and Belgium." Parliamentary figures commented on the Foreign Secretary's speech, saying that Eden had only said that he would consider the proposals put forward by German Führer Hitler in terms of the future negotiating situation, and had not directly agreed to start negotiations, but the path of negotiations had not been closed. Conservatives, Liberals, and Laborites all expressed their approval of the Foreign Secretary's speech, but for different reasons. The Conservatives believed that after Germany abrogated the treaty, the country's credibility was not trusted. No matter what, other countries were increasingly reluctant to trust each other. However, at this time, the British army, navy, and air force were still too weak. If coercive action were taken, the responsibility would be great and not something that Britain could bear, so it should not be hastily decided. The Labor and left-leaning Liberal Party members believed that the proposals put forward by Führer Hitler were not the main part of the overall German policy. These labor leaders believed that Germany's proposal was aimed at gaining the sympathy of voters in other countries, and that its return to the League of Nations would have this effect. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The speeches delivered by British Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons yesterday were very welcome by newspapers here. German newspapers believed that the British government was convinced that Germany did not want to wage a war of aggression and said that British Foreign Secretary Eden had opened the door to a reasonable discussion of the future of Europe.

<h3>The United States Does Not Want to Be Drawn into the Whirlpool of European War</h3>
<p>Washington - Senators from both parties today stated that the United States should no longer participate in any European war. Senator Norris said that the United States was not in danger of being drawn into the whirlpool, but if one country in Europe started a war, then Japan would join in and attack Soviet Russia, or take the opportunity to develop its power in China. During the last European war, Japan had reaped the benefits, gaining German colonies. Senator King said that if Britain, France, and Belgium failed to recognize the accomplished facts, then there was no hope of averting the disaster of war. Senator Shipstead also said that he did not believe that Hitler was intent on provoking war and that the Locarno Treaty should have been abolished long ago. Everyone knew that it was a source of future war. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Communists Demonstrate Against Germany, Eleven Killed, German Consulate Flag Torn Down</h3>
<p>Cadiz, Spain - Today, communists in Cadiz rioted all day, tearing down and trampling on the German flag from the flagpole of the German consulate. The German consul has protested to the authorities and asked the government to severely punish the troublemakers. Eleven people were killed and twenty-four injured in today's riots. At the same time, the army, carrying armored vehicles, machine guns, and tear gas, mobilized in the streets to suppress the unrest. A large group of rioters stormed a church, stole an image of Jesus, and burned it in the street. In the Toledo area, the left and right factions exchanged fire with pistols and rifles, killing four and injuring nine. There were also riots in other places, such as Castellón, Valencia, Valladolid, and Seville. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

<h3>Locarno Treaty Signatory Countries Paris Conference France Advocates Issuing Warning to Germany Insists Germany Withdraw Troops First, Then Start Negotiations Otherwise, Demands League of Nations Implement Strict Sanctions</h3>
<p>Paris - At a meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here today, France advocated issuing a final ultimatum to Germany, ordering German troops to withdraw from the Rhineland immediately, otherwise strict sanctions would be imposed on Germany. Flandin further advocated that France, Britain, Italy, and Belgium recall their ambassadors to Germany, which was also included in the final ultimatum. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - At the meeting of representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning, French Foreign Minister Flandin first delivered a speech, stating the attitude decided by the French Council of Ministers regarding Germany's unilateral abrogation of the treaty and the dispatch of troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. He said, "France is willing to conduct negotiations with Germany, but with a prerequisite: the international treaty that has been violated must be restored to its original state, that is, the German troops that have entered the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland without authorization must withdraw before negotiations can begin. Germany's violation of international obligations is obvious. When the League of Nations Council meets on Friday, it will certainly condemn it. France is prepared to implement any remedial measures that the Council decides to take." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, France and Belgium have both submitted requests to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, asking him to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council.

This meeting was held this morning at 10:30. France was represented by Foreign Minister Flandin, Belgium by Prime Minister Janson, Britain by Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax, and Italy by Ambassador to France Cerutti. In addition, several experts attended the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m. A communiqué was immediately issued, listing the titles of the representatives of each country, but no news was released. After the meeting, the chief representatives of the countries concerned had lunch together at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Troop Withdrawal Issue French and German Opinions Differ Greatly</h3>
<p>Paris - According to responsible sources, France is prepared to start negotiations with Germany on the following two conditions: 1. Germany first withdraws its troops from the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland; 2. A conference is convened within the League of Nations framework in Geneva. France is unwilling to conduct bilateral negotiations with Germany and only intends to sign a new Locarno Treaty with Germany guaranteed by a third party. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - A German government official spoke to a Reuters reporter today about the conditions proposed by France for France and Germany to begin negotiations, saying that there was absolutely no question of German troops withdrawing from the Rhineland. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Senate and Chamber of Deputies Meet Premier Sarraut Speaks Insists Germany Withdraw Rhineland Troops</h3>
<p>Paris - French Premier Sarraut spoke in the Chamber of Deputies today, giving a tit-for-tat response to Hitler's memorandum abrogating the Locarno Treaty, saying that Germany's destruction of the demilitarized zone not only affected France's security, but also the future of European peace and the League of Nations' collective security organization. We will determine our position through the League of Nations mechanism, because the fate of the League of Nations will soon be endangered. In the name of German culture and national character, we ask the Germans to carefully consider their new responsibilities. The people of other countries very much want the Germans to bear this responsibility in history. We solemnly declare that we have never wanted to infringe on Germany's freedom and honor. France does not profit from Germany's misfortune. France has never refused anything that could consolidate the future of peace and promote negotiations between France and Germany, but it cannot negotiate under violence and under the treaties we freely negotiated. France is prepared to unite with other member states of the League of Nations and respond to schemes that destroy international treaties, collective security, and the structure of peace. Once the dignity of international law is restored, France is prepared to negotiate with Germany. Germany has torn up the Locarno Treaty that it voluntarily signed, and France has the right to respond. A certain French newspaper recently published Hitler's comments, saying that Hitler was willing to get close to France and warned that if this gesture was ignored, serious consequences would occur. After these comments were published, French Ambassador to Germany François-Poncet made contact in Berlin. France's spirit of peace can be seen in this. The Premier then asked whether Germany's destruction of the Locarno Treaty and the Treaty of Versailles was answered by the French Ambassador François-Poncet by Hitler. He continued, saying that France had recognized much and endured for a long time, hoping that there would be an emotion on the opposite side of the Rhine River to replace suspicion and repetition. However, Germany had answered with successive blows to the treaty, the last of which was the worst. He did not know whether Germany wanted to threaten France to talk to it. The Premier concluded by saying that the question of talking to Germany now existed, but nothing could be done in the atmosphere created by Germany's violent actions. This situation could not continue. The French government had decided to appeal to the League of Nations. After the League of Nations examined the actions of destroying the Locarno Treaty and the Treaty of Versailles, it would decide on the issue of sanctions. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to meet this afternoon. At that time, Premier Sarraut will personally attend the Chamber of Deputies to read a speech explaining the government's response measures. It is expected that all members of the Chamber of Deputies will support it and display the spirit of "national unity". In the Senate, Minister of Justice Delbos will represent the government and read the same speech. Some senators who had originally expressed objections to the ratification of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty have now withdrawn their objections at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday. Therefore, when the Senate discusses this treaty on Thursday, it is expected to be passed by a unanimous vote. Foreign Minister Flandin will go to Geneva tomorrow to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Council's thirteen-nation committee to discuss the negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia. He was originally scheduled to rush back to Paris on Thursday to explain the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Since there is now a good chance that this treaty will be passed smoothly, he can stay in Geneva and wait for the League of Nations Council to discuss the German problem on Friday, without having to make a hasty trip back home.

<h3>Frequent French Military Movements; Bank Run Occurs Near the Border; British Fleet Mobilizes in Egyptian Port</h3>
<p>Paris: Following Germany's entry into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, French military movements in the eastern border towns have been frequent. According to reports from Belfort, troops passed through the city today, heading to the Rhine River to reinforce defenses. A report from Compiègne states that several defense units originally stationed at Mont Vaudois have left their camps and are heading to various fortresses along the Franco-German border. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: France continues to strengthen its defenses along the border. The Southern Army Corps has arrived at the border fortification zone, and the 6th Brigade of the Moroccan Tirailleurs Division has moved from the Rhône Valley to Montmédy. Troops have been deployed to reinforce the 6th, 7th, and 21st defense sectors. On the German side, military movements are also ongoing. According to reliable sources, the German military strength in the Rhineland is now comparable to that on the eve of the Great War. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Metz: Since Germany's entry into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, there has been widespread anxiety in the eastern part of France, reflected in bank runs in cities of Alsace-Lorraine. One savings bank in Metz reportedly experienced withdrawals of three million francs. Meanwhile, France is making every effort to consolidate its eastern defenses. According to reports from Nancy, twenty trains fully loaded with trucks, tanks, and soldiers departed from Toul for the border today. It is reported that the German side is also preparing for all eventualities. The Saar Defense Force is constructing outposts on the high ground and has arrested several individuals who previously advocated for the independence of the Rhineland. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Demilitarized Zone of the Rhineland Now Garrisoned by 60,000 German Troops; Half Are Reformed Police</h3>
<p>Berlin: The demilitarized zone along the Rhine River is now garrisoned by 60,000 German troops. Half of them are police forces who have been stationed in the Rhine area for some time and have recently been incorporated into the national defense forces. The other half are regular national defense troops, who have arrived successively in the past two days. The German government has not issued a notification regarding the incorporation of the police into the national defense forces, but it is confirmed by the declarations made by the chiefs of police in Cologne and other cities. In general, the German garrison there has at least four divisions, as well as several air force squadrons. According to various newspapers, these squadrons are stationed in Düsseldorf, Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz, Mainz, Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, Speyer, and Heidelberg. It is also reported that Aachen, Trier, and Saarbrücken have only a few companies, but when combined with the police forces already stationed in these three locations, the number is considerable. Furthermore, two squadrons of fighter planes are stationed in Frankfurt, Mannheim, Cologne, and Düsseldorf. The Nazi Party's newspaper, the Angriff, claimed that when the troops arrived in Cologne, bomber planes soared overhead, but this was not mentioned in the official announcement. In addition, there are thirteen artillery battalions in the demilitarized zone, each divided into three companies, as well as many tanks and anti-tank machine gun teams, all of which arrived at the same time as the infantry.

<h3>Rumors in Rome: Two Italian Divisions to be Recalled; Request to UN to Lift Sanctions</h3>
<p>Rome: It is widely rumored here today that General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, and two divisions of Italian troops on the Eritrean front will be recalled soon. This is largely due to the tense European situation following Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. It is widely believed that the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa has received instructions from Rome to order a halt to the offensive against Ethiopian forces on the northern and southern fronts in the coming days. Italian forces will, of course, hold the areas they have occupied, but although there will be no formal truce, small-scale battles are inevitable, and the Italian army will avoid large-scale operations. Italy is determined not to abandon its important demands on East Africa and is eager to remain a major power in Europe. According to rumors here, Italy's demands on East Africa have now gained more sympathy and understanding from various countries. This may lead to the restoration of the Stresa Front and allow Italy to re-establish itself on the side of Britain and France. At the same time, Italy is quietly observing how the League of Nations will deal with Germany's open violation of treaties. It is widely expected that Italy will demand the immediate lifting of sanctions against Italy as a bargaining chip for cooperation with France and other countries. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Abrogation of Treaty Driven by Internal Crisis; Economy Minister, Foreign Minister, and Army Chief Opposed Move at Meeting</h3>
<p>London: According to the Berlin correspondent of The Times, Hitler's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty was a desperate step driven by internal difficulties. Germans are convinced that the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty will facilitate the passage of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, but few observers had expected Hitler to risk Germany's relationship with Britain and France by sending troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. The Minister of Economy and President of the Reichsbank, Dr. Schacht, and other moderate leaders had urged Hitler to re-engage with Western European countries to save Germany's financial and economic situation, as Germany's efforts to rebuild and raise funds to meet rearmament were already evident in the expansion of government loans. The leaders of the Nazi Party opposed Schacht's advice. It is rumored that last week, when Hitler met with Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Hitler's disarmament commissioner Ribbentrop, Aviation Minister Göring, Defense Minister Blomberg, and Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder, all except Schacht, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Army Commander-in-Chief Fritsch favored reoccupying the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. This decision was then made, and Schacht threatened to resign in favor of someone else. It is widely believed that Hitler's sudden decision was prompted by Britain's guarantee of France's security against German aggression in the Rhine and the momentum of French support for the oil embargo against Italy. The moral implications of violating the Locarno Treaty do not seem to have been considered by the German authorities. However, it should be known that Germany's current political system is the result of years of compromise and adaptation. If it can achieve its goals, the public will not question the methods used, and newspapers are now controlled by the authorities, so most</p>
<h3>Future Measures of the New Japanese Cabinet; All Policies to Follow the Military's Lead; Diplomacy to Focus on Cooperation with Europe and America; Strengthening Stance Against Russia; Future Actions Toward China Remain Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Nanjing: After the coup, the Japanese cabinet, after several difficulties and setbacks, was finally formed by Hirota on the evening of the 9th, shouldering the heavy responsibility of restoring the situation. According to observers familiar with Japanese politics, Hirota spent five days of labor negotiating with the military to complete the formation of the cabinet, succumbing to the military's demands. Therefore, although the new Japanese cabinet is headed by a diplomat, the power of the military will undoubtedly be further expanded than before. According to sources here, the new cabinet will not only strive to expand the military budget, but also all future policies will follow the military's lead. Although the Japanese side claims that the new cabinet's diplomatic policy has not changed, judging from the current situation, it is expected that it will adopt cooperative steps with Europe and the United States to avoid Japan's isolated position in the international community. In the short term, there will be concrete manifestations of strengthening its stance against Russia. Recently, Germany announced its withdrawal from the League due to its opposition to the Franco-Soviet Pact. In the future, it will form a confrontational state with Russia and France. The relationship between Japan and Germany has a great impact on the situation in the Far East and is of great concern to the world. As for diplomacy with China, Hirota's established three principles will not be abandoned, but whether his steps will adopt aggressive tactics is difficult to predict at this time. All parties are paying close attention to the future actions of the new cabinet. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>

They only decided not to leave the military ranks. (China United News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Why Does Mussolini Want War?</h3>
<p>— By Lious Pisher, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>—— Observations on the European Situation Under the Shadow of War, Part 4 (Continued)</p>
<p>The most brilliant speeches by Ratini and Rossoni were what I heard in the Senate. Mussolini was also greeted with enthusiastic cheers there, but when the Prince of Piedmont and four accompanying members of the royal family arrived, the thunderous cheers of "Savoy! Savoy!" made me dare not believe that they had not received the same cheers before. These five dignitaries came to the Senate not in their gorgeous automobiles, but in horse-drawn carriages with double reins. This is just an unconscious habit, but it can also be regarded as a symbol, a symbol of conservatism, especially closely related to the landlords. There are many leaders of the landlord aristocracy in the Senate. It is very obvious that as long as the royal aristocracy and the landlord privileged class exist, the entire barren land of Italy will not be distributed to the farmers who are suffering from land scarcity. In the Senate, in addition to representatives from academia and the military and political circles, there are also many large entrepreneurs. That is another specially granted right. Mussolini certainly hates these reactionary groups. He can only try to reduce the legislative function, but one point can be proved: the political dictator cannot be completely dictatorial in economic and social aspects.</p>
<p>This answers the question of why Mussolini wants to launch the Ethiopian War. Fourteen years ago, a social revolution almost broke out in Italy. The workers had actually occupied many factories, and if there had been more determined leadership, perhaps they would have succeeded long ago. The peasants openly rebelled against their miserable lives. The capitalists were frightened, and the economy lost its strength. They were disappointed with Italy's gains in the Great War. Except for the cowardly Facta, they could not find a stronger talent. Then came Mussolini. At that time, there were many armed conflicts in the country, one of which was the conflict between Mussolini's Fascist Party and Rossoni's Social Syndicalist Party. Mussolini finally brought Rossoni and others under his own command. He eliminated the opposing forces by insidious means and won the support of the pro-status quo faction. Then, after the famous March on Rome, he organized the Fascist cabinet by imperial order. Mussolini also extinguished the workers' organizations. He inspired the bourgeoisie with new hope and self-esteem. At that time, both the countryside and the cities still hoped that a social revolution would liberate new productive forces. But those who hoped for revolution were suppressed, while those who opposed revolution were very powerful. As a result, only a political change was formed. Under Mussolini's pressure, these old problems are still brewing. Mussolini is just trying his best. He created many public works to relieve unemployment, but at the same time, he increased the burden on the country. He closely monitored the bourgeoisie. Although he had taught them self-esteem, he did not respect them. He continued to relieve them, making them have to submit. Perhaps he also noticed the poverty of the lower classes, but he could not and would not engage in any fundamental economic or social reforms.</p>
<p>Within the limits of the lives of the landlords and urban bourgeoisie, Mussolini has indeed done his best for Italy's economy. But soon he quickly realized that this limit was too narrow and began to prepare for another stimulus. This stimulus is not in the economic interests of imperial development. The Fascists themselves are also very skeptical of the material benefits gained from conquering Abyssinia. Rossoni said to me: "Our march in Abyssinia completely relies on a lot of money and the use of barren land." Italy had to borrow foreign debts in order to develop Abyssinia, and only by borrowing could she buy raw materials to manufacture weapons in the country. In 1934, there were only 3,400 Italian residents in the entire territory of Eritrea, most of whom were still officials and teachers. What can guarantee that there will be better results in Abyssinia?</p>
<p>Fascists often pay attention to things more important than material conditions. An article by Bo Daai, the Governor of Rome, published in the "Messagero" newspaper on November 14, 1935, said: "Naturally, the wealth of Abyssinia is one of the factors in the problem... It is one of many factors, but not the most important factor." Italy has a mission; she must promote culture. Italy is strong; she must vent her passion and courage. If Italy had great potential for development at home, her rulers might say to the younger generation: "Prepare to become rich and strong! Create new machines! Build new industries and cities, and lead Italy towards great economic construction!" However, these possibilities do not exist. So the rulers said: "War is glorious" — war for the sake of war. This mystical worship has become necessary for governments in economic and social straits. Abstract values such as blood and land, as well as the so-called high-sounding tune of bringing European culture to dark Africa, can actually achieve real results, driving hundreds of millions of people to make the most sincere efforts and the greatest sacrifices. Isn't this the power of recent propaganda and education? — Although now only a few Italians still believe in the lofty significance of conquering Abyssinia. Under the constraints of oligarchy, Italian fascism is spinning a cocoon and binding itself, but wants to cut it off with a sharp knife. But before the knot is broken, it first hurts itself. Whether there is Abyssinia or not, the Fascists must face the domestic problems of Italy. Therefore, this so-called mystical worship will certainly be endless and will inevitably produce new goals — Egypt, India? If Britain gives up Abyssinia without resistance, then Italy may say that occupying the Nile region is less time-consuming and labor-intensive than civilizing Abyssinia.</p>
<p>No matter how much they harvest in Abyssinia, the Italian Fascists will never be satisfied. Mussolini may know that he will not get any comfort in Abyssinia. Someone heard him say to many foreigners a few weeks ago that the Abyssinian war might inspire him to lead a social revolution. Although he did not say how he would do it, it would have profound significance. Mussolini clearly knew that he had failed.</p>

Otherwise, they will be punished separately in accordance with the regulations on the punishment and reward of civil and military officials in the bandit suppression area. All civil and military officials responsible for bandit suppression should be stationed in the bandit area, approach the people, and earnestly supervise. All important counties in the bandit suppression area should be temporarily treated as first-class counties and strengthen the strength of the local district offices. Each county in the bandit area should select excellent county magistrates for transfer and use. The counties bordering the three provinces should cooperate with each other and jointly suppress bandits in accordance with the principle of joint defense. The roads in the border area of the three provinces should be completed and connected as soon as possible to facilitate military operations. The telephone lines in the border area of the three provinces should be completed and interconnected as soon as possible. (9th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Sends Troops to Assist in Suppressing the Remnants of Bandits on the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Zhang Dingcheng's Forces Rampant in Xiayang; Yongding Fellow Association Cables Guangdong for Assistance</p>
<p>Guangzhou Newsletter: The remaining bandits on the Fujian-Guangdong border have become rampant again recently. Zhang Dingcheng's forces, which were previously suppressed by the government army, have gathered their remnants and fled back to Yongding, Shanghang, and Wuping, and are colluding with Zhou Lixing's forces and Gu Dacun's forces in Kanshi to stir up trouble in the Lantian Xiayang area, burning, looting, and killing. The local people have moved, and the local people have repeatedly appealed to the Fujian and Guangdong authorities to send troops to join forces to save the people in the bandit area from fire and water. The Fujian authorities previously sent the army's division to advance and search from Nanjing and Longyan, but the bandits stubbornly resisted in Xiayang, and are still under siege. The Yongding Fellow Association in Guangdong hopes that the banditry in their hometown will be put down as soon as possible, and has sent cables to the Guangdong authorities to quickly send troops to assist in the suppression. The authorities yesterday ordered the Independent First Division Huang Renhuan's department, which was stationed on the Fujian border, to send troops to Yongding for suppression. In order to consolidate the border defense in eastern Guangdong, the authorities will transfer a certain brigade from the province to Fengshun to search and suppress the local bandits in Fengshun and Raoping.

<h3>W皖省 Establishes Agricultural Warehouses Across the Province: Adjusting Production and Sales, Lowering Prices, and Rescuing the Collapsing Rural Economy by Establishing an Agricultural Warehouse Management Office to Manage Everything</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province's agricultural products, especially rice, have long been famous domestically. In recent years, due to the decline of the rice market and the collapse of the rural economy, people's livelihoods have suffered. So-called rural revitalization through agricultural cooperatives and agricultural loans, although a way to help the rural economy, how far cooperative ventures can be promoted, and how much money can be loaned to rural areas, may have little effect in this entire rural death crisis. The only way to save it is to adjust production and sales and regulate grain prices. However, in recent years, droughts and floods have occurred almost throughout the country. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other southern provinces have mostly used foreign rice to supplement food, and even counties along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province have imported it. Even in rice-producing areas of Anhui Province, such as Hefei and Sanhe, there are still contradictory facts of overproduction and low grain prices. According to the statistics of rice exports in the 24th year of the Republic, excluding rice and miscellaneous grains from northern Anhui counties collected and exported through Bengbu, the rice and grain exported from Wuhu in southern Anhui totaled 5,122,900 shi and 3,966,823 shi of miscellaneous grains in twelve months, totaling over 9,089,000 shi, proving that Anhui Province's agricultural production is indeed surplus. However, after the autumn harvest, farmers in various counties, fearing low prices, wanted to wait for a better price to sell, but due to their own debts and the pressure of life, they had no choice but to sell at low prices to rice merchants. The rice merchants then hoarded and speculated, and then resold it to farmers at high prices during the lean season of the following year. During this turnaround, the exploitation and losses suffered by farmers were profound and huge, leading to the bankruptcy and collapse of the entire rural economy. The Anhui Provincial Government has recently made its greatest effort to establish rural warehouses to engage in the sole task of adjusting production and sales and regulating grain prices. These warehouses are planned to be established throughout the rice-producing areas, with a general management office in Anqing or Wuhu. The provincial government has decided to appoint Yang Mianzong, Director of the Department of Finance, as the concurrent director of the management office, and Liu Yiyan, Director of the Department of Construction, as the deputy. It is divided into three sections: general affairs, technology, and finance. The biggest task of the finance section will be to plan the issuance and circulation of agricultural warehouse securities throughout the province, the control and liaison of agricultural warehouse agricultural product transportation and sales, and the allocation of agricultural warehouse funds throughout the province. As for the agricultural warehouse funds, since the Anhui Province decided to invite the national banking community to hold an economic conference in Wuhu, the banking community has agreed to invest 4 to 5 million yuan, so the establishment of agricultural warehouses can be realized in the near future. The organizational regulations of the Agricultural Warehouse Management Office are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Anhui Provincial Government has established the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Village Management Office to manage the province's agricultural warehouses, regulate food supply and demand activities, and rural finance. Article 2: The Agricultural Village Management Office shall have one director and one deputy director, who shall oversee all affairs of the office. Under them is a secretary, who shall be responsible for planning and managing all matters to be handled by the office under the direction of the director and deputy director. Article 3: The Agricultural Warehouse Management Office shall have three sections: general affairs, finance, and technology. Their responsibilities are as follows: (A) General Affairs Section: Matters relating to the custody of seals; Matters relating to the receipt and dispatch of documents; Matters relating to the storage and organization of files; Matters relating to accounting, cashier, and general affairs; Matters relating to other matters not belonging to the financial and technical sections. (B) Finance Section: Matters relating to the allocation of funds for agricultural warehouses throughout the province; Matters relating to the issuance and circulation of agricultural warehouse certificates throughout the province; Matters relating to the control and liaison of agricultural warehouse agricultural product transportation and sales throughout the province; Matters relating to the research and implementation of agricultural warehouse accounting throughout the province; Matters relating to the assessment of agricultural warehouse business throughout the province; Matters relating to the guidance and training of agricultural warehouse management personnel throughout the province; Matters relating to other matters to be handled. (C) Technical Section: Matters relating to the design of the construction and repair of agricultural warehouses throughout the province; Matters relating to the technical guidance of agricultural product storage and inspection of agricultural warehouses throughout the province; Matters relating to the technical facilities for agricultural product packaging, transportation, and sales of agricultural warehouses throughout the province; Matters relating to the selection and installation of equipment for agricultural warehouses throughout the province; Matters relating to other matters to be handled. Article 4: The General Affairs Section shall have one director and two clerks. The Finance and Technology Sections shall each have one director, one inspector, and two to four clerks. Article 5: The Agricultural Warehouse Management Office may employ employees as necessary for its affairs. Article 6: The detailed rules for the Agricultural Warehouse Management Office shall be determined separately. Article 7: These regulations shall be implemented after being approved by the Provincial Government Committee meeting (March 8).</p>
<h3>General Situation of Highway Transportation in Henan Province: The Number of Open Road Lines is Gradually Increasing and Has Reached 2,000 Kilometers; the Decline of the Rural Economy Has Greatly Affected Highway Business</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: Highway construction is a complex and multifaceted undertaking. To achieve complete facilities, sufficient financial resources are essential. Henan Province has been operating highway transportation for more than four years, and the number of open road lines has gradually increased. At present, the total has reached 2,000 kilometers, making rapid progress. Since Zhang Jingyu took charge of the construction of Henan Province, he has gradually improved highway transportation. In the past two years, significant progress has been made, and funds are currently being raised to purchase vehicles to expand operations. The situation of highway transportation in Henan Province is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Current Status of Engineering</p>
<p>The highways opened to traffic in Henan Province total 1,923.98 kilometers, with 25.52 kilometers paved with coal and gravel, and 11.52 kilometers paved with brick and gravel. A total of 4,344,213 cubic meters of earthwork has been completed, 206,166 cubic meters of rock excavation, and 276 girder bridges have been built, totaling 4,632 meters in length. Among the major projects, the Shihe Bridge on the Xin-Huang Road is 360 meters long, the Zhuganhe Bridge is 396 meters long, the Xiao Huanghe Bridge is 47 meters long, and the Rufen Bridge on the Xu-Wan Road is 141 meters long. Seventeen culverts made of reinforced concrete have been built, totaling 1,203 meters in length, with 371 culverts and 541 water pipes. The completed highway construction projects in the province (excluding earthwork built by conscripted labor) include: (1) The Xin-Huang Road on the Beijing-Shaanxi main line, 102 kilometers long; the Huang-Shang Road, 39.84 kilometers long; the Shang-Ye Road, 54.95 kilometers long; (2) The Huang-Xiao Road on the Bian-Yue main line, 65 kilometers long; the Luo-Xuan branch line, 57.1 kilometers long; the Huang-Jing branch line, 64.45 kilometers long; the Shang-Jing branch line, 19 kilometers long; the Shang-Sha branch line, 33.5 kilometers long; the Shang-Jing branch line, Sha-Jing Road, 25.54 kilometers long; the Nan-Li branch line, Fang-Huang Road, 18.9 kilometers long; the Shang-Gu branch line, Fang-Guo Road, 16 kilometers long; (3) The Kai-Xu provincial road, 105 kilometers long; (4) The Kai-Dao Road, Kai-Liu section, 11.52 kilometers long; In addition, the Lin-Tai branch line, and the Yu-Xu-Xu-Zhou sections, total 155 kilometers long; (5) The An-Kai provincial road, Dao-Kai section, 108 kilometers long; the Dao-Pu branch line, 58 kilometers long; are all built by conscripted labor and are not included in the construction cost. The total construction cost of the above roads is 2,005,614 yuan, with an average construction cost of 1,068 yuan per kilometer. This cost is only one-third of the regulations of the Economic Commission and the road construction costs of other provinces. The frugality of road construction costs in Henan Province can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Economic Situation Along the Route</p>
<p>There are a total of sixteen highway lines open to traffic in the province, passing through seventy towns (39 county towns and 31 townships). (1) The Kai-Yu line starts from Kaifeng, passes through Zhuxian Town, Weimin, Youchuan, Xuchang Quanshi, and ends at Yu County. (2) The Kai-Dao line starts from Kaifeng, passes through Liuyuan Kou, Fengxue, Banshi, Tunhua County, and ends at Daokou. (3) The Kai-Zhou line starts from Kaifeng, passes through Chenliu, Qi County, Chuanji, Longquji, Taikang, Huaiyang, and ends at Zhoukou. (4) The Kai-He line starts from Kaifeng, passes through Qudianji, Kaoyu, Wang Haotun, and ends at Heze County, Shandong Province. (5) The Kai-Xiang line, in addition to the same route as the Kai-Yu line from Kaifeng to Weiminji, passes through Ling, Fugou, Xihua, and ends at Zhoukou. (6) The Xu-Nan line starts from Xuchang, passes through Yingqiao Town, Xiang County, Ye County, Baoan Station, Fangcheng, Bowang Town, and ends at Nanyang. (7) The Xu-Lin line, in addition to the same route as the Xu-Nan line from Xuchang to Xiang County, passes through Bang County and ends at Linru. (8) The Shang-Bao line, A. The Zhou-Wu section starts from Zhoukou, passes through Tanzhuang, Luohe, Wucheng, and ends at Wuyang. B. The Zhou-Hao section starts from Zhoukou, passes through Huaiyang, Luyi, Wuyang, and ends at Hao County, Anhui Province. (9) The Zhou-Ying line starts from Zhoukou, passes through Shuizhai, Huaidian, Jieshou, Jiuxianji, and ends at Yingzhou, Anhui Province. (10) The Zhou-Zhu line, A. The Ru-Zhu section starts from Runan and ends at Zhumadian. B. The Ru-Luo section starts from Runan, passes through Shangcai, and ends at Luohe. (11) The Nan-Zhen line starts from Nanyang, passes through Liaohe Town, and ends at Zhenping. (12) The Xin-Huang line starts from Xinyang, passes through Wulidian, Luoshan Zhaihe, and ends at Dan Chuan. (13) The Huang-Ma line starts from Huangchuan, passes through Shawo, and ends at Macheng, Hubei Province. (14) The Huang-Ye line starts from Huangchuan, passes through Shuangliushu Shangcheng, and ends at Yejiaji, Anhui Province. (15) The Huang-Jing line starts from Huangchuan, passes through Guangshan Popihe, and ends at Jingfu. (16) The Huang-San line starts from Huangchuan, passes through Chunhepu Gushi, and ends at Sanhejian, Anhui Province. The economic situation along the route, except for the Kai-Yu, Kai-Zhou, and Xu-Nan lines, where production is relatively abundant and slightly flexible, the Kai-He, Zhou-Ying lines are all declining, and the areas passed through by the Huang-Ma, Huang-Jing, and other counties in the southern Henan special zone have been ravaged by bandits and economic difficulties have reached an extreme point. In recent years, droughts and floods have been intertwined, and the Communist bandits have been rampant, so the rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>Among the open road lines in Henan Province, the Kai-Yu, Kai-Xiang, Xu-Nan, and Xin-Huang lines have relatively developed passenger transport, with a monthly income of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The Shang-Bao, Kai-Dao, and Kai-He lines are second. The Huang-Jing, Huang-San, and other lines have the lowest income, with only a few hundred yuan per month. Passenger transport is more developed in March, April, May, September, October, and November, with a monthly income of about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. In the severe winter and autumn floods, either the sky is covered with ice and snow, or it is rainy, and the vehicles are difficult to drive on the unpaved highways once it rains and snows. According to statistics, passenger transport income in the 23rd year of the Republic was 313,757 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen, accounting for 92.6% of the total income. However, freight transport in Henan Province has never been developed. The reason is that labor is cheap, and the value of transportation by earthen vehicles or packhorses is only equivalent to three grades of trucks (the price of three grades of goods is 3 jiao and 2 fen per kilometer per ton), or one-third to one-quarter of the freight. Truck freight transport is therefore greatly affected. After the opening of the roads in southern Henan in July of the 23rd year of the Republic, they are connected to the Ping-Han Road and close to Hankou, and the prices of goods fluctuate from time to time. In order to rush to sell goods and make huge profits, some merchants take the highway, and freight transport has developed slightly. According to statistics, freight transport in one year was more than 390,000 kilograms, and the freight was 15,583 yuan, 3 jiao and 6 fen, accounting for 4.6% of the total income. In addition, mail transport is also handled, with a value of 1 fen and 4 li per kilogram for 50 kilometers. The income from mail transport in the 23rd year of the Republic was 6,012 yuan, 4 jiao and 6 fen, accounting for 1.78% of the total income. According to Henan Province's own highway transportation, the business was good when it was first started, and the repair costs of the new cars were very low, so there were repeated surpluses. By the 22nd year of the Republic, affected by natural disasters and the decline of the rural economy, the business was very sluggish. Although everything has been reorganized and expenditures have been reduced as much as possible, the expenditures still reached more than 92% of the income due to excessive repair costs, which is not satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Inspector Wang Arrives in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Wang Gongyu, the newly appointed Administrative Inspector and concurrently Security Commander of the Songjiang District, recently sent personnel to Songjiang to survey and determine the People's Education Center as the location of the office together with the county government, and to arrange everything. Now Inspector Wang has completed the handover of his duties in Tongshan and arrived in Songjiang by Jingzha train on the afternoon of the 10th. There were three followers. County Magistrate Li and Zhao Zanchen, captain of the 12th Security Brigade, personally went to the station to welcome him. The New Songjiang Society is temporarily used as the headquarters, and arrangements are being made to enter the office to work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Envoy Arrives in Songjiang for Inspection</h3>
<p>Ding Chaowu, the supervisory envoy of this province, is currently inspecting the agencies of various counties in this province to see the progress of government affairs. It is reported that he will arrive in Songjiang on the 11th to inspect the situation of various agencies to promote it.</p>
<h3>Gambling is Rampant in Urban and Rural Areas of Suzhou</h3>
<p>Gambling has always been rampant in Suzhou, but it has become more prevalent in the past two years. During the transition period of the county magistrate and the training of the director of the public security bureau in the province, gamblers took the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities. Gambling dens were set up in various urban and rural areas, with considerable rules. Although the police districts broke up seven or eight major gambling cases in Lumu and other places in the past few days, arresting more than one hundred gamblers, who were all sent to the court for punishment, there are large-scale gambling places in Suzhou Township and Li Shu Township. After the Public Security Bureau sent an inspector to investigate, they immediately sent personnel to investigate. They had already moved after hearing the news. The Public Security Bureau specially ordered its subordinates yesterday (9th) to conduct strict investigations to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>The General Labor Union Asks for the Suppression of Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, the spring weather has turned into winter, and the climate has been severely cold. Spring-ripening plants such as wheat and rapeseed have been greatly affected. This summer's harvest will definitely be reduced. Because of this, rice shops in Suzhou have been hoarding and speculating, causing rice prices to rise continuously to more than one yuan a week. Ordinary people are complaining, and other vegetables have also increased in price. In view of this, the Wu County General Labor Union specially pleaded for the poor people and submitted a petition to the Wu County Government and the County Party Department yesterday (10th), requesting the suppression of rice prices and strictly prohibiting profiteering merchants from hoarding and speculating, in order to maintain the livelihood of the people. The County Chamber of Commerce will also convene rice industry representatives in the coming days to discuss the rice price issue.</p>
<h3>The Body of a Child Died Unexplainedly, and an Autopsy Was Performed</h3>
<p>Ma Ada, the son of Ma Shengjue, a villager in Zhangjiagang Township, Xijing, Suzhou Township, was only thirteen years old. He hanged himself to death the day before yesterday. At that time, he was approved by the local court to be exempted from autopsy. However, the neighborhood suddenly spread that Ma Ada's death was caused by his mother, Ma Wu, who abused him and injured him to death. The police district reported to the local procuratorate, which sent Prosecutor Lu and the police to the township to open the coffin for autopsy yesterday (10th). It was found that there were slight injuries on the waist and back, but they were not the cause of death. He returned to the hospital in the afternoon and will summon Ma Wu and Ma Shengjue for interrogation and verification.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Educational Personnel Appeal</h3>
<p>The People's Education Promotion Association and the Social Education Federation of this county previously received an order to close all social education institutions before the 15th of this month, causing the staff to live a hard life. They discussed and decided to unite various counties to appeal unanimously. Wu County expressed sympathy for this move by the association and specially sent representatives Ma Xishui to Wuxi to negotiate and jointly appeal to the county magistrate and the director of education to go to the province to express their grievances and plead for the social education colleagues. At the same time, they requested the province to find ways to provide relief, and that the salaries of the staff of the social education institutions that should be closed should be paid until the end of the July semester of this year to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Rice and Bean Industry Association Re-election</h3>
<p>The Rice and Bean Industry Association of this county held a re-election the day before yesterday. Voting began at 1:00 p.m. and the ballots were counted at the time. As a result, Zhao Zixin, Yu Yunxiang, Qiu Zixin, Li Shenchen, Yin Zhujun, Xie Weihan, Xu Zhihe, Ren Zishan, Qian Nianxiu, Tao Yin Fu, Hu Baoxun, Yu Chongkun, Chen Hongyuan, Wang Weichen, Zhou Yichen and other fifteen people were elected as executive members, and Xi Xuchu, Xu Rongqing, Chen Shijin, Tong Yiqun, Guo Yangyi, Li Dongshan, Chen Zilin and other seven people were elected as alternate executive members. Zhao Zixin, Li Zhongchen, Yin Zhujun, Qiu Zixin, and Xie Weihan were elected as standing members, and Zhao Zixin was elected as the standing chairman.</p>
<h3>The Defense String Donation is Collected as Usual</h3>
<p>The county government held its 60th political affairs meeting yesterday, chaired by Wang Rongsan. It was resolved that: 1. The County Party Department's Supervisory Committee sent a letter requesting the cancellation of the defense string donation when compiling the new budget for the 25th year of the Republic to ease the burden on the people. After investigation, the defense string donation is 2 cents per string ticket per period. There are about 580,000 households in this county throughout the year, with a total of 1.16 million string tickets in two periods, and 22,200 yuan should be collected, which has been allocated for the expenses of the security team. Now it is ordered to be paid to the province on a monthly basis starting from March of this year. The county has no other funds to offset it, so it will be collected as usual for the time being, and it will be submitted to the province for approval after raising offsetting measures. 2. The farmland in the North Seventh Fang Town of the Ninth District was damaged by white grubs last autumn, and the rural areas are impoverished. The county sent a letter to the Red Swastika Society and the Borren Charity Association to find ways to provide relief. 3.

<h3>Pirates Rob Yuhuang Pavilion in Taicang</h3>
<p>Yonglian, the abbot of the Yuhuang Pavilion in Chuanshan, the fourth district of the county, and five or six disciples were sleeping on the night before when twenty pirates suddenly came, speaking in a mixed accent, each holding sharp knives and other weapons. They first stabbed the accountant Wu Youxian six times, and the monks were injured to varying degrees. After looting for about an hour, they all roared and fled in all directions. The loss was about several hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Takeover of the Dada Steamship Bureau in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin branch of the Shanghai Dada Steamship Company was originally contracted by Chen Peisheng from Nantong for many years, but Chen suddenly passed away the year before last, and all the contracted affairs were taken over by Chen Zitiqing. However, in recent years, the company has owed thousands of yuan to the Shanghai General Bureau. Last winter, the Shanghai company sent personnel to Cheng to collect the debt. The branch could not cope, and the staff raised 3,000 yuan to pay it off before they could get through the difficulties. The company intended to reorganize the branch in this county, so at the end of last month, it formally entrusted Zhang Gongren (Jianhou), the current special commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, to take over. Zhang once came to Cheng last month to discuss the handover procedures with Chen and others, but failed to reach an agreement for a while. Zhang immediately left Cheng to go elsewhere. On the 5th of this month, Zhang received a notice from the Shanghai General Bureau, ordering him to take over and formally operate on the same day. After receiving the notice, Zhang appointed Chen Baochu to come to Cheng to take over. However, the previous operator Chen Tiqing was unwilling to accept it and made things difficult, so in recent days, all the unloaded Cheng goods have been changed to Liuxi Port on the opposite bank. Zhang has now sent a letter to the local authorities to send police to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Xiangshan Has Collapsed into the Yangtze River in Nantong</h3>
<p>The river bank in Tongyi has been collapsing extremely severely in recent days. In the Nansha area, more than ten feet of farmland has collapsed into the river in one day and night. Xiangshan, southwest of Langshan, has now entered the river. Once the spring flood arrives, Langshan may also collapse into the river, returning to its early Qing Dynasty state. Because the local area's soil retention funds can only be used to build dikes, the cost of emergency rescue is huge, and the province is calling for help.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Staff Members of the District Security Department</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Security Headquarters was reorganized. Commander Ge Tan appointed the following staff members: Chief of Staff Peng Longxiang, Staff Officer Jiang Binyuan, Director of Management Wu Jingxiu, Quartermaster Li Xun, Military Judge Zhu Feiru, and Director of the Escort Office Hu Rui. The Yuan Dou Bridge area in the city, the city root base, and the official land in the four townships and Taiying are all military properties. They were previously leased by the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, and lease certificates were issued to collect rent. During the last land report, most of these military properties were merged with the people's land, and they could not be divided, so they were all taxed according to the string. All the tenants now do not know where to pay the rent and taxes, and it is also inconvenient to pay both sides, causing duplication. The county government sent a letter to the Department of Finance for instructions, and now it has received instructions stating that the military properties in the county have always been paying rent, and there is no need to levy grain tax again. This land is different from the people's land. It should be registered separately after the land report to avoid confusion.</p>
<h3>Jia Length Commits Assault and Surrenders to the County</h3>
<p>Wang Shaokang, the head of Jia of Luo Dawei in Touqiao, the third district of Jiangdu, used a rake to injure his sister-in-law Yin, causing serious head injuries with blood and flesh blurred. Those who upheld justice reported to the garrison security team. At that time, Wang had already thrown the rake into a nearby ditch and surrendered himself to the township official in charge. Just in time, the town chief Peng Songjiu had received the report and prepared a document overnight to send Wang Shaokang to the Third District Office. Yesterday (8th), the district had transferred him to the county government. However, the murder weapon, the rake, is still in the shallow ditch, with the rake head buried in the mud and the handle standing in the water, two feet long. It is temporarily guarded by the township official.</p>
<h3>Luo, the President of the Court, Dies, and His Father-in-Law Dies of Grief</h3>
<p>Luo Zhizhen, the president of the Jiangdu Local Court, died of illness at the private residence of Bai Liufang on South Gate Street yesterday (8th) at about 6 p.m. Luo was from Hubei and was a lawyer in E for five years. He came to Changjiang Jiangdu Court on July 1 last year and worked very seriously. However, he was kind and fond of Buddhism and showed excessive sympathy to prisoners. Two weeks ago, he suffered a sudden outbreak of hemoptysis and took a leave of absence for recuperation. The court affairs were temporarily handled by Shao Yunwen, a judge. Unexpectedly, the illness became more serious every day, and he sent a telegram to Hankou to invite his father-in-law Li Jingan (79 years old) to come to Yangzhou for medical treatment. Li was originally a famous Chinese doctor. Yesterday (8th) afternoon, he arrived here, but Luo was already in his dying moments and there was nothing he could do. Soon after, he died, leaving behind a wife, three sons, and two daughters. The youngest was still in swaddling clothes. Li, at his advanced age, witnessed this tragedy. He grieved not only for the death of his son-in-law but also for the loss of his jewel of a daughter. Overwhelmed with grief, he sighed loudly this morning (9th) at about 6 a.m. and died at Luo's residence. Currently, Luo's wife, Mrs. Li, is still sick. She has sent a telegram to her family in Hubei. At the same time, the court also sent a telegram to the High Court. They received an order to have Judge Shao temporarily act as Luo's replacement. It is reported that Luo's remains were placed in a coffin at the hour of Xu on the 9th. Li's remains are waiting for his family in Hubei to come to Yangzhou before they can be placed in a coffin.</p>
<h3>District Office Smashes Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the kidnapping case of the son of Gong Ping, a resident of the 14th Bao of this city, the Third District Office recently obtained a tip and dispatched Inspector Jiang, who apprehended the principal offender, Ni Bangzhi, in the Houshantou area. Ding Jiangshi, Yin Zhongwen, Wei Shazi, Lu Zishan, and five others were also arrested. During the search of the three bandits, Ni, Yin, and Wei, a total of sixty-two yuan in ransom notes with secret markings made by the Gong family were found. According to their confession, accomplices Wu Anbao, Wu Duoshan, Lu Mingzhu, and Fu Yiliang were arrested in Yao Huaying. Five long and short guns and ten yuan of the same banknotes were seized on the spot. After questioning at the station, all one thousand suspects were handed over to the county for legal processing.</p>
<h3>District Headquarters Sentences Soil Trafficker</h3>
<p>The well-known soil trafficker, Yu Shaoshan (from Shanghai), was found transporting over forty bags of soil by train from Shanghai to He on February 7. He was intercepted by the Public Security Bureau at the Jiaxing Railway Station. He was taken to the bureau and transferred to the District Security Command for interrogation. After the military judge examined the case, Yu Shaoshan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment yesterday for the crime of drug trafficking.</p>
<h3>Strictly Urging the Collection of Land Tax</h3>
<p>Since the 16th year of the Republic of China to the 24th year, the arrears of land tax owed by the people of Jiaxing, including provincial and county taxes, total more than five million. The county government has now been ordered to handle the tax clearance. From March 1, all fines for late payment of land tax will be waived. On the one hand, the province will send commissioners to the county to expedite collection. The county government has also formulated several measures to repay the arrears in installments. Failure to meet the deadline will result in detention and forced recovery according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Orders Strict Collection of Salt</h3>
<p>The dispute over the suspension of salt collection in various areas of eastern Zhejiang has lasted for ten months. Representatives of salt farmers have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Transportation Office. After lengthy negotiations, the Ministry of Finance has decided to order the Liangzhe Transportation Office to urge all areas to resume the full collection of salt and to collect the four-tenths of the quota not collected in the 24th year. This order has been relayed for compliance. Recently, a "eating big households" trend has emerged among salt farmers in Yuyao, which was stopped and resolved by the tax police. For fundamental relief, the Transportation Office plans to relocate some salt farmers to cultivate land in Jiangxi Province, with the government providing housing to solve their living problems as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Jiahu Road to Open Next Month</h3>
<p>In order to complete the Jiahu Highway, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau has leased the road to the Jiahu Motor Vehicle Company, organized by Wu Yushen and Chen Qinshi, for operation. A loan of 250,000 yuan has been secured to meet the needs of the project. Both parties have signed a contract. The first payment of 100,000 yuan has been made, and the second payment of 160,000 yuan is scheduled to be made by the end of this month. After the completion of all earthwork and bridge projects on April 15, the remaining amount will be fully paid. The lease term for the road is 20 years. Jin Tanghou has been publicly appointed as the manager of the commercial company, and it is planned to purchase 40 passenger vehicles to start operations in April.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fengxin Road to be Operated by Merchants</h3>
<p>The Fengxin Highway, managed by the Fourth District Management Office of the Provincial Highway Bureau, has recently experienced a surge in passengers and booming business. However, due to the scarcity of vehicles, supply cannot meet demand, resulting in passengers waiting for two to three days for a car. The Provincial Highway Bureau has decided to invite merchants to operate the road. The Hao Xin and You Feng long-distance bus companies have jointly leased the road. The managers of the two companies have been instructed to go to Hangzhou for negotiations, and the contract will be signed soon.</p>

<p>Foreign Loan Interest Rates Rise</p>
<p>Recently, the market has improved, and the financial situation has gradually become active. Various industries are actively expanding their operations, leading to a situation where the demand for funds in the money market exceeds the supply. Yesterday, the foreign loan interest rates rose to one jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets, which means one jiao of interest per thousand yuan per day. According to the market spokesman, since the opening of the market this year, the foreign loan interest rates were as low as five or six fen, and at most seven or eight fen, due to the sluggish market conditions. The current rise to one jiao is purely due to the need for funds for various industries to purchase goods.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Federation Fetes Mr. Joyce</h3>
<p>British chemical expert Dr. Joyce came to China from Japan. The China Industrial Federation hosted a banquet yesterday at 2:00 PM at the International Recreation Club, inviting domestic chemical experts to attend. Those present included Xu Shanxian, Xu Zhengkeng, Pan Lujie, and foreign guests Sacs, Goth, Malford, and others. Chairman Qian Chengxu delivered a welcoming speech, stating that today, the China Industrial Federation welcomes British Dr. Joyce, and is honored to have both Chinese and foreign experts present. China's chemical industry has been striving for promotion in recent years. The most prominent example is the establishment of the China Industrial Gas Refining Company four years ago, which primarily produces industrial oxygen cylinders. This year, on New Year's Day, the Tianli Light Gas Factory was also opened. However, these are just the beginnings of our country's chemical industry. We expect that in the near future, there will be more chemical industrial plants, such as coal-to-oil factories, established one after another to lay the initial foundation for China's production of raw materials. Regarding this, our association has a proposal. Within the scope of light industry, such as artificial leather, spray paint, artificial ivory, oil extraction, film production, artificial musk, etc., our country has no domestic production and all rely on foreign sources. We are deeply pleased that Dr. Joyce is an expert in several of the aforementioned fields and has extensive practical experience. Therefore, our association will take the opportunity of today's reception for Dr. Joyce to invite colleagues in China who are interested in the chemical industry to our association's office at 115 Hankou Road at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th of this month to publicly entertain guests. At the same time, we will invite Dr. Joyce to attend and give a lecture and experiment. We will greatly welcome the presence of domestic colleagues. Dr. Joyce then gave a brief reply, and the event ended.</p>

<h3>Xu Fu Appointed to Office on 16th</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Presides over Swearing-in Ceremony, Internal Staff to Remain Unchanged, According to Shen Shi News Agency, after the Central Government appointed Xu Fu as the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau and concurrently as the Director of the Land Bureau, Xu once went to Beijing to visit Minister Kong and attend a meeting of the Board of Directors of the China Farmers Bank. After returning to Shanghai, he was originally scheduled to fly to Fujian on the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong flight yesterday morning (the 10th) to handle the handover matters of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance. However, the Central Government considered that the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Land Bureaus are critical to municipal administration and should not be left vacant for too long. Therefore, a special order was issued to Xu to take office in Shanghai before proceeding to Fujian. After receiving the order, Xu postponed his trip to Fujian and decided to first take office as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Land Bureaus. According to the reporter of Shen Shi News Agency, Xu is scheduled to take office as the Director of both bureaus at 9:00 AM on the 16th of this month (Monday) in the city center.

<h3>Maritime Accidents and Incidents</h3>
<p>The Steersman of Donghua Damaged by Ice, Maller Hits Reef, Shelters in Taiwan, Unstuck and Returns to Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Yongyuan Shipping Company's Donghua was sailing to Yantai and Longkou, but due to the extensive ice on the sea, it encountered thick ice near Jimu Island, making navigation difficult. The Donghua was squeezed by the ice, causing damage to the rudder at the stern. The ship has now anchored outside Zhongkou and is undergoing repairs. The shipowner has sent a telegram to Shanghai, stating that after repairs are completed, the ship will sail to Longkou to unload cargo.</p>
<p>Maller Rescue</p>
<p>The Maller, chartered by the Taichangxiang Customs Broker on behalf of the British shipping company Gracie &amp; Co., was loaded with miscellaneous goods in Shanghai and sailed to Quanzhou, Fujian. Last Wednesday, the ship encountered a severe storm, and the hull was struck by the waves, hitting a reef near an island opposite Taiwan. The iron plates were punctured, and seawater leaked in, causing significant damage. The ship risked sailing to Taiwan, used cement to patch the leaks, and then proceeded to Quanzhou. The cargo suffered significant losses. According to the person in charge of Taichangxiang, the ship has escaped danger and is unharmed. The insurance company responsible for the marine insurance is handling the damaged cargo, and the insurance association has sent personnel to Quanzhou to inspect the situation.</p>
<p>Yushun Insurance</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushun was the first ship to be trapped by ice outside the Dagu Port in the Bohai Sea. Around January 10, it suffered damage and returned to Tanggu after traveling seven nautical miles in 64 hours. At that time, the ship returned to Tanggu Port for repairs, and the bow was damaged by the ice. Since then, the sea has been blocked by ice, and Yushun has repeatedly attempted to set sail, but has been unable to do so. It finally left Tanggu on the 9th of this month and sailed back to Shanhaiguan. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 12th).</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Starts Reorganizing Old Debts</h3>
<p>Cai Zengji Denies External Rumors of Solution, According to New Sounds News Agency, as of now, the old debts of the China Merchants Bureau, including accumulated interest over the years, total approximately 30 million yuan in national currency. The creditors, such as the British HSBC Bank, the American China Commercial Company, and the banking syndicate composed of various Chinese banks and money shops, have used docks, warehouses, and properties as collateral. During the tenure of Zhao Tieqiao, Li Zhonggong, and Guo Waifeng as commissioners, and Li Guojie and Liu Hongsheng as general managers, attempts were made to reorganize the debts, but the large amount of old debts made it difficult to handle. The bureau's business had improved during Liu's tenure as general manager, and revenues and expenditures were able to match, with profits at the end of each year. However, the amount of profit was far from enough to repay the interest on the old debts. At the same time, the creditors were understanding and willing to waive part of the interest to facilitate reorganization. After Cai took office as general manager, he first prepared a plan to reorganize the old debts and is currently in contact with Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng. As for external rumors that a solution has been reached and the government will assume the debts, reducing the interest rate from one percent to four per mille, General Manager Cai has officially denied this.</p>
<h3>Local Japanese Spinning Mills Change Product Policy, Which Can Be Learned by Chinese Spinning Mills</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Nichinichi Shimbun, the Japanese textile industry in Shanghai has been mainly engaged in cotton silk products, but is gradually shifting towards cotton fabrics. At the same time, in order to reduce costs and adapt to the current economic recession, Japanese spinning mills have recently been adding weaving machines one after another. For example, the Rihua Textile Factory in Pudong originally had only 736 machines, but has now added 700 machines. On the one hand, the factory equipment is being expanded, and a construction tender has been announced.</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica and Zhejiang Construction Bureau Co-Establish Meteorological Observatory in Dinghai</h3>
<p>The Required Funds Fully Allocated and Construction to Start Immediately and to be Completed in One Month, According to Shen Shi News Agency, Academia Sinica and the Zhejiang Construction Bureau believe that meteorological facilities along the coast of Zhejiang Province are critical to navigation, water conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, and other aspects. They jointly decided to co-establish a meteorological observatory in Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang. The Academia Sinica was originally responsible for the cost of purchasing instruments, while the fishing industry and the Dinghai County government were responsible for raising funds for building construction and internal miscellaneous equipment. The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau was to be responsible for 200 yuan per month for ongoing expenses, and the Academia Sinica was to be responsible for 100 yuan per month. Subsequently, due to the tight budget of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the bureau's expenses for the second half of the 24th year were eliminated, and the construction and equipment costs were insufficient due to the fishing industry's inability to raise the required amount. Therefore, both parties recently agreed to transfer the funding for the nine months from July of the 24th year to March of the 25th year to supplement the shortfall. The three months of funding that the Water Conservancy Bureau should have allocated has been re-allocated from the temporary expenses, so that construction can begin immediately, with the goal of completing the construction of the meteorological observatory within one month.</p>
<h3>Class A Unified Government Bonds: Exchange Begins Today; Regulations for Banks and Customers on Exchanging Bonds Held as Security or Collateral</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to consolidate domestic government bonds and other securities, submitted a proposal to the Central Government to issue unified government bonds. After the bond certificates were printed, it was decided that starting today, the Bond Exchange Office on Jiangxi Road in this city, as well as the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in various locations, would handle the exchange. To facilitate customers, the various banks in this city, through their association, have drafted exchange procedures on behalf of customers and announced them for public knowledge. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Class A Unified Bonds Can Be Exchanged Starting Today</p>
<p>Exchange of Class A Unified Government Bonds will commence today. Holders of 22nd Year Patriotic Treasury Bonds, Short-Term National Treasury Certificates, 18th Year Customs Treasury Bonds, 22nd Year North China War Zone Bonds, Security Bonds, and 19th Year Customs Treasury Bonds can request application forms starting today. After filling them out, submit them along with the old bonds to the Bond Exchange Office to receive a temporary receipt. After five days, the new bond certificates can be exchanged for the receipt. The smallest denomination of the new bonds is ten yuan. If the remaining amount after the exchange is less than one yuan, the Exchange Office will pay the stamp tax accordingly. If the remaining amount is within ten yuan, the difference can be paid in cash at 98% of the face value to exchange for a bond certificate. The Bond Exchange Office in this city is located at 452 Jiangxi Road. The Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in various locations will handle the exchange on behalf of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Bank Announcement of Exchange Procedures</p>
<p>The Bankers' Association of this city, in conjunction with its member banks, has formulated five regulations for exchanging unified government bonds on behalf of customers with bonds held in custody or as collateral, as follows: To facilitate customers who have entrusted bonds for safekeeping or as collateral for loans, the banks will exchange the old bonds for new bond certificates on their behalf. If the customers who have entrusted bonds for safekeeping or as collateral for loans do not require the banks to exchange on their behalf and wish to exchange themselves, they must notify the banks immediately; otherwise, it will be deemed that they have entrusted the exchange according to the first regulation. For each type of old bond, if the remaining principal is less than ten yuan, it should be made up to ten yuan with national currency calculated at 98%. Customers should bring their previous bond custody receipts and bond collateral receipts to the bank to exchange for new government bonds within two weeks after the exchange date stipulated by the Ministry of Finance for each type of bond, as announced in the bulletin. The original seal must be brought with the receipt for verification and a new receipt will be issued. In the future, principal and interest will be received with the new custody receipt. If customers who have entrusted bonds fail to exchange for the new custody receipt by the deadline, the names of the bonds listed on the old custody receipt will be invalid. The bank will store the new government bond certificates to be exchanged according to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. Because these new government bonds are subject to lottery, it is hoped that customers will exchange for the new custody receipt as soon as possible to avoid losing the right to participate in the lottery for the new government bonds. Please pay special attention.</p>

It was decided to notify users to contact each other. The Shanghai Medical Review Society wrote, stating that starting this month, it would unanimously refuse to pay telephone bills to prompt the company to realize the issue. It was decided to comply.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Ministries of Finance and Industry to Request Increased Import Tax on Wax Paper</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministries of Finance and Industry in Nanjing, stating: "Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry: On the 9th of this month, the Municipal Paper Industry Association sent a letter stating: 'Recently, a letter from our member, the Meijin Wax Paper Factory Co., Ltd., stated: Wax paper has not been manufactured in China in the past. According to the Maritime Customs Reports for the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China, the total annual import volume of foreign wax paper was approximately 8,000 reams. The amount lost over the years is alarming. In view of this, our factory has been determined to conduct research and establish a factory specializing in wax paper production, in the hope of recovering some of the lost profits. Since the introduction of our Peacock brand wax paper, we have had a monthly production of 5,000 to 6,000 reams. Thanks to the promotion of various sectors, the future of domestic goods seems to have a glimmer of hope. However, foreign goods are being dumped one after another, deliberately infringing upon our market. If we do not quickly seek to suppress this, the future of domestic goods will be dire. Therefore, we are requesting the Ministry of Industry to provide protection and assistance, and also to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Customs to increase the import tax rate on foreign wax paper.' We believe that your esteemed association is leading effectively. Therefore, we are writing to request your protection and promotion, and to assist in forwarding this request so that the goal of increasing the import tax rate on foreign wax paper can be achieved quickly, so as to suppress foreign goods, etc.' According to this, the factory was established in June of the 24th year of the Republic of China and reportedly has a paid-up capital of 140,000 yuan. It holds company registration license number 832 and is located on Feihong Road in Shanghai. It uses new machinery to imitate foreign-style wax paper and has already succeeded. The quality and gloss of the paper are comparable to foreign goods and are very popular with Chinese people in the market. The import of foreign wax paper is estimated to be more than 8,000 reams per month. The factory, which was established not long ago, already has a monthly production of 6,000 reams. Two-thirds of the total sales of foreign wax paper can be replaced by domestic goods. If it can gradually advance and increase production, it will soon be popular throughout the country, and there will be no need to rely on foreign sources for wax paper. However, according to the current market situation, due to the low-price dumping by foreign merchants, the factory cannot even maintain its costs. If no measures are taken to suppress this and the foreign goods are allowed to encroach upon the market, the future of domestic goods will be dire. The Association has submitted a letter enclosing six samples of paper and respectfully requests your esteemed association to examine them, and to forward this request to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the current import tax rate on foreign wax paper be raised when the import tariff is revised, so as to maintain the domestic goods that are just beginning to take shape and prevent the encroachment of foreign goods, etc.' Sample paper is also attached to the letter. According to this, wax paper is mostly imported from foreign countries, with imports from our eastern neighbors being the largest. Today, the Meijin Wax Paper Factory is able to amass capital and equip itself with machinery to imitate foreign-style wax paper, and already has a monthly production of 6,000 reams, which is sufficient to compete with foreign wax paper. However, at a time when domestic wax paper is just beginning to take shape, foreign paper is actively dumping its products using its special financial resources and influence, which is a major blow to domestic paper. The Association intends to request that the import tax rate on foreign wax paper be increased when the import tariff is revised, which is the only way to protect imitated machine-made foreign goods. Therefore, we are enclosing two samples of paper and respectfully telegraphing your departments for your examination and approval. We humbly request that you forward this request to the Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the import tax rate on foreign wax paper be increased to prevent dumping and protect domestic paper. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, respectfully. Jiayin."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Sydney, Australia Donate to Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road has been providing disaster relief services for the Jianghe River floods. It has successively raised a significant amount of relief funds and supplies, which have been distributed to disaster areas. Many survivors have been able to live off of these supplies. Recently, because the floodwaters in the disaster areas have not receded completely, most of the disaster victims want to return home but have no home. They want to farm but have no seeds. They are still living a precarious life. The association, witnessing this situation, could not bear to sit idly by. It decided to launch a spring relief effort and continue to provide assistance. It appealed to people at home and abroad for donations. Many people were touched and generously donated large sums of money. Overseas Chinese organizations were even more enthusiastic in their donations. In total, they have remitted more than 100,000 yuan in relief funds. Recently, Mr. Wang Gongfang, the Consul General of Australia in Sydney, also remitted more than 660 yuan in national currency, stating in his letter that he plans to continue raising and sending funds. Overseas Chinese are concerned about the disaster victims and do not forget those far away. This is truly a model for the world.</p>

<h3>Land Bureaus of Shangnan and Nanhui Counties to Jointly Measure Border Areas with Isolated and Interspersed Lands</h3>
<p>Since the Shangnan and Nanhui county governments surveyed and measured the land, there are still many isolated and interspersed lands in the fifth district of Pudong, on the border between Shangnan and Nanhui, which have not been rectified to this day. Owners cannot register for the time being. Now, Chen Hang District Chief Xing Zhigang and Zhoupu District Chief Shen Shunan have invited the heads of the Shangnan and Nanhui Land Bureaus, Jin Yanze and Li Zhiping, respectively, to lead surveyors to conduct on-site measurements. Once the measurements are completed, owners can immediately submit forms for registration.

The supplementary measurements have now been completed, and the interspersed boundaries were rectified yesterday to facilitate local administration.</p>
<h3>Husband Suffering from Mental Illness: Zhang Xiuying Sues for Divorce; What Illness Does the Defendant Have? Forensic Medical Examination Needed</h3>
<p>Xu Shunfa, the son of Xu Yunpei, a local wealthy merchant residing on Houjia Road in this city, married Zhang Xiuying four years ago. Recently, Zhang Xiuying, with the assistance of lawyer Hu Jue, filed a lawsuit in the local court seeking a divorce from her husband, Xu Shunfa. Her reason is that the defendant suffers from a mental illness and is currently being treated at the Chinese Mental Hospital. Since the defendant suffers from madness, the plaintiff's lifelong happiness is almost completely deprived. Instead of living a nominal married life, it is better to break away. She also requests the second defendant, Xu Yunpei, to be responsible for paying alimony. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the parties through Judge Cao Baozhen. Because the defendant did not appear, the case could not proceed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Cao again presided over a trial in the Civil Court No. 10. The defendant still did not report, but was represented by a lawyer. The plaintiff, Zhang Xiuying, arrived in court with lawyer Hu and testified as described above. The defendant's lawyer then stood up and argued that the illness suffered by the defendant, Xu Shunfa, was typhoid fever, not incurable madness, and that there was a diagnosis from Puyu Hospital that could prove this. The plaintiff's lawyer then rose and said, "Please have the court designate a reputable hospital to identify what illness the defendant is suffering from." Judge Cao designated the Zhenru Forensic Medical Research Institute on the spot. In consideration of the cold weather, he postponed the summons to the defendant to go to the institute for identification by a few days for the defendant's safety, and would then rule based on the findings. The court adjourned after the instructions.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Case of Mr. Graf, General Manager of Banque Franco-Chinoise</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment; Mr. Graf Plans to Appeal, Refusing to Accept the Verdict</p>
<p>Mr. Graf, a German national who served as the Vice Chairman and General Manager of the defunct Banque Franco-Chinoise, was accused of privately converting 32,000 yuan in cash, deposited by depositor Yang Xiqing with Budetuo for safekeeping, into a notice deposit. This morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the First Special District Court, announced the verdict. The main points of the verdict stated: "Graf is found guilty of continuous breach of trust and sentenced to six months imprisonment, along with a fine of 1,000 yuan. If the fine is converted to labor service, the daily amount will be calculated at 3 yuan, in proportion to the six-month imprisonment. The remaining parts of the accusation are dismissed. Regarding Yang Xiqing's incidental civil suit, the defendant shall compensate the plaintiff with 20,000 yuan in national currency, along with a statutory interest rate of 5% per annum from June 14th, 1935, until the date of execution. The plaintiff's remaining claims are rejected." Since the collapse of Banque Franco-Chinoise, its top officials who have been convicted include former Chairman Dang Wen and Bai Lang. Now, with the addition of Graf, the total number is three. However, Mr. Graf was not present at the verdict announcement this morning, and there were no changes to the 20,000 yuan cash guarantee he had previously submitted. It is reported that Mr. Graf plans to file an appeal within the legal time limit.</p>
<h3>Law and Politics College Professors Sue for Owed Tuition; Lawyers Argue for a Long Time, Judge Advises Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenjing from Fujian and Lang Luxun from Zhejiang were hired to teach courses at Shanghai Law and Politics College last year. Due to the college's financial difficulties, they were owed over 500 yuan in tuition fees. Recently, Chen and Lang hired lawyers to file a lawsuit with the civil division of the Second Special Court, seeking to recover the owed wages and requesting the court to order Zhang Shizhao, the legal representative of the Law and Politics College, to repay the full amount. The court approved the request and summoned the parties yesterday morning. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case and the object of the request, the defendant's lawyer did not acknowledge the plaintiff's request. However, they claimed that according to the teaching affairs office, the second plaintiff's French teaching skills were inadequate and he was irresponsible, resulting in him being unpopular with students. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested the clerk to record the defendant's lawyer's statement. The judge considered that this matter was unrelated to the wage arrears case and did not need to be recorded. However, the plaintiff's lawyer repeatedly insisted, stating that a scholar's reputation is their second life, and that the second plaintiff in this case had been teaching at Shanghai Guanghua, Fudan, and other universities for many years and that the situation was not as the defendant's lawyer described. Moreover, the owed salary had been reduced by 70% or 80%, leaving less than half, and had been delayed without payment. Even if there was no salary, the plaintiff would be willing to be a voluntary professor. The lawyers argued for a long time, and the judge strongly advised both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court and adjourned the case for another scheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Bribery, Recantation, and Incitement to Perjury: Investigation into Gu Zhuxuan's Case Concluded; Defendants Thoroughly Deny Gu Songmao Posted Bail for Release, Remaining Defendants Returned to Custody</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a key suspect in the incitement of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, was suspected of bribing Chief Warden Wu Lu and others while being held in the external medical prison, inciting the felons Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, among others, to recant their testimonies. Gu's elder brother, Gu Songmao, was also suspected of involvement. Following repeated investigations by the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, it was concluded that Gu Zhuxuan, Wu Lu (the chief warden of the Second Special Court's detention center, previously assigned to Guangci Hospital to oversee Gu Zhuxuan), Ma Xianxian, the warden of the detention center Ma Xianxiang, the brothers Ma Xiancai, Wang Yushou, and Gu Songmao, totaling seven individuals, were suspected of jointly inciting perjury. The case was brought before the criminal division of the same court. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan, presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants Gu Zhuxuan and Gu Songmao were represented by lawyers Jiang Yiping and others. The court ordered the defendants to be brought forward and first questioned regarding their age and origin. Gu Zhuxuan was 50 years old, from Yancheng. Gu Songmao was 55 years old, from Yancheng. Wu Jingnian was 51 years old, from Yangzhou, serving as the chief warden of the Second Special District Detention Center. Ma Xianxiang was 23 years old, from Anhui, serving as a warden in the detention center. (Ma Xianxian, Ma Xiancai, and Wang Yushou were at large and not present.) Subsequently, Chief Prosecutor Qiao rose and stated the reasons for the prosecution, roughly stating that during the trial of Gu Zhuxuan for allegedly inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, witness Zhang Tinggui, after taking an oath, and the original informant Zhao Guangfu, who had not taken an oath, both unequivocally testified that the assassination of Tang Jiapeng was indeed instigated by Gu Zhuxuan. Later, this court based its judgment on their testimonies and convicted Gu. However, by the second instance of the trial, the reason for the changes in the testimonies of the various criminals was that Gu Zhuxuan had instructed Wu Lu to negotiate with Ma Xianxian and the fugitives Ma Xianxiang, Ma Xiancai, and Wang Yushou, among others, to incite Zhang Tinggui, telling him to recant his testimony during Gu Zhuxuan's appeal hearing and promising him a large sum of money in the future. Later, Zhang Tinggui reported this, and the evidence included two deposit books, one under the name of Wang Chunhua and the other under the name of Zhang Sen, which were successively deposited in the Daya Bank and were once taken by Zhang Tinggui and deposited in the hands of the inmate Cao Shida. Later, it was found that the funds were repeatedly delivered from Ma Xianxian to Gu Zhuxuan's home, handled by Gu Songmao, and paid out in cash, which was then transferred by Ma and deposited in the Daya Bank. From this, it can be seen that Gu Zhuxuan's bribery and recantation have been proven by the facts. Moreover, the successive escapes of Ma Xianxiang, Ma Xiancai, and Wang Yushou make the facts even clearer. The details of the prosecution are stated in the indictment, requesting a trial according to the law, etc. The court ordered the defendants to be questioned separately, starting with Gu Zhuxuan. Asked where he was being held, he replied, "In the external medical prison." Asked if he had bribed Ma Xianxian and others in the detention center to incite recantations, he replied, "At the entrance of the external medical prison, there are three detectives and two plainclothes officers from the police station, along with one warden, watching day and night. How could there be any bribery or incitement of wardens to recant? I have never given them a single copper coin. After I was detained, my external businesses all failed. Where would I get a large sum of money to bribe?" Asked if Zhang Tinggui testified that he had sent people to contact him four times, he replied, "That is not the case." Asked if the bribery to recant was the intention of his family or himself, he replied, "I am completely baffled by the discovery of this matter. In prison, my every move is watched. Zhao and Zhang are like my enemies, why would I give them a single penny? Moreover, they previously tried to extort money from me, and I refused, leading to this false accusation. I am now willing to die fighting them in court, and I am not willing to give them money." Asked why Zhang Tinggui recanted in the appellate court, he replied, "Their testimonies always differed." Further asked, "The prosecutor questioned Zhang Tinggui, who testified that it was advocated by Gu Si Lao Chuang, who called Ma Xianxiang to relay the incitement to recant, and that Ma Xianxiang stated that he contacted your wife, Cai, and your elder brother, Songmao, to obtain the money," he replied, "My elder brother, Songmao, did pay for a lawyer to seek justice for me, but he would never pay money to buy a crime for me." Asked if he had ever met Ma Xianxiang and his brothers, he replied, "I have never met them." The court then summoned Gu Songmao to the stand and asked, "Who is Gu Zhuxuan to you?" He replied, "He is my younger brother." Asked if he often visited him, he replied, "I used to visit often last year, but I haven't visited once this year. Usually, his female relatives come to visit." Asked if he contacted Zhang Tinggui and others to recant, he replied, "That was not me." Asked if Zhang Tinggui testified that he was contacted by Ma Xianxiang, he replied, "I don't know who Ma Xianxian is." Asked if the Daya Bank deposit book was real, he replied, "I don't know." Asked if he had any notes during each visit, he replied, "Yes, and we had to speak softly because there were people watching nearby." Asked if Zhang Xiaosizi also testified that Chief Wu contacted them, he replied, "That is not the case. No one has ever come to my house asking for money." Asked if the prosecutor was now prosecuting him for aiding and abetting perjury, he replied, "You cannot unjustly accuse me of a crime." Asked if he knew Chief Wu, he replied, "I knew him because I often went to visit." At this point, Wu Lu was summoned to the stand and asked, "How long have you been the chief warden?" He replied, "Half a year." Asked when he went to Guangci Hospital, he replied, "I was transferred there on November 11th last year, and it has been four months now." Asked if he had also transferred Ma Xianxiang and others there, he replied, "I have never seen them." Asked what the rules were for meeting with inmates, he replied, "You must first register at the detention center and then meet, once every three days, and the detention center sends someone to watch each time." Asked if he had ever been to Gu's house, he replied, "No." Asked if the prosecutor was prosecuting him for perjury, he replied, "The prosecutor is using the inmates' testimonies to accuse me." Asked if Zhang Xiaosizi said that Ma Xianxian was his apprentice, he replied, "No." Asked if he knew about the deposit book, he replied, "I don't know. I have been working in prisons for over ten years, and I have never done anything out of the ordinary." The court then ordered Ma Xianxiang to be brought forward and asked, "How many years have you been working?" He replied, "Three years." Asked if Ma Xianxian and Ma Xiancai were his relatives, he replied, "Yes, they are." Asked if he often interacted with them, he replied, "Although they are relatives, we don't interact often and don't talk." Asked if he knew about the recantation efforts, he replied, "I don't know." Asked if he was Wu Lu's apprentice, he replied, "No." Asked if Wu Lu had told him to contact Ma Xianxian and Ma Xiancai, he replied, "That is not the case." Asked if the prosecutor had questioned him several times, he replied, "Twice, and I also said I didn't know." Judge Li ruled that the investigation into this case was concluded and that another hearing would be scheduled at a later date. Gu Songmao was released on bail by the original guarantor, and the remaining defendants were returned to custody. Wu Lu and Ma Xianxiang's requests for bail were denied.</p>

<h3>Stepmother's Rampage: Daughter Covered in Wounds; Couple's Testimony Evasive and Cruel; Deserving of Punishment</h3>
<p>Cai Wenming, a native of Tongzhou, is thirty years old. His first wife passed away five years ago, leaving behind a daughter named Yueying, who is now eight years old. Two years ago, Cai remarried a woman surnamed Hu from Suzhou (twenty years old). They initially lived together at 16 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road. Hu was particularly violent and often abused Yueying. On the fifth of this month, Cai moved the family to a garret room at No. 16, Lane 582, Zhejiang Road. However, Hu did not change her nature and continued to beat Yueying with an iron hammer. Cai also aided the abuse, resulting in Yueying being covered in wounds, a truly pitiful sight. On the eighth of this month, Hu once again employed her old tricks, severely beating Yueying eight times in one day and depriving her of sufficient food. Kong Zaoxian and Qiu Ahquan, who lived in the same residence, couldn't bear to hear Yueying's cries every day and reported the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Qiu Sijiu was ordered to arrest Cai Wenming and Cai Hu, and confiscated the iron hammer and broken clothes hanger used in the abuse. Cai Yueying was sent to Guangren Hospital for examination, confirming severe injuries. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation, stating that Yueying had repeatedly claimed to be hungry while at the police station, and it was discovered that she had not eaten for two days. Detectives bought her food to satisfy her hunger. They are being prosecuted under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, for abusing a girl under sixteen years of age, causing obstruction to her reproductive development, and requesting severe punishment under the law. Subsequently, Cai Yueying was brought before the court. Her face was completely bruised and swollen. Initially, she testified that the two defendants had never beaten her. Judge Qian Hongye realized that she was afraid of the two defendants and dared not speak the truth. He ordered the police to temporarily remove the two defendants from the courtroom, and the girl then revealed the truth, saying that her stepmother (i.e., Cai Hu) had started beating her within days of moving in, striking her shoulders and legs with an iron hammer, and that her father (i.e., Cai Wenming) also beat her severely with a clothes hanger, and did not allow her to eat her fill, and that she had not had enough to eat for five days. The court then ordered the two defendants into the courtroom, but they both denied abusing the girl, offering exceptionally cunning testimonies. Judge Qian found the defendants' methods so vicious as to be deeply abhorrent. Since Cai's injuries needed to be examined by a forensic doctor, he ordered the case adjourned for another week. The defense lawyer requested bail, which the court rejected.</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin Departed Shanghai by Ship Yesterday Morning; Was Entertained by Hu Die, Watched a Play with Mei Lanfang, and Said He Enjoyed His Visit to Shanghai and Would Return for a Longer Stay</h3>
<p>The world-renowned comedic film star Charlie Chaplin, along with actress Paulette Goddard, Goddard's mother, and Chaplin's Japanese private secretary Yoshito Mimori, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Coolidge. That evening, they returned to the ship and departed for Hong Kong at nine o'clock yesterday morning, then on to Manila in the Philippines, then Saigon in Annam, and finally Singapore, before reaching Batavia, Java. It is planned that after a month or two, they will return to the United States via the same route, and will pass through Shanghai again for a longer stay. Mr. Chaplin praised his trip to Shanghai, saying that it was very interesting, and that the beauty and loveliness of Chinese women far surpassed that of European and American women. Mr. Chaplin checked out of his room at the Cathay Hotel around 7 o'clock the night before last to accept an invitation from the Chinese movie star Hu Die. During the dinner, he told Ms. Hu, "I have not yet seen any of the films starring you. When I return to Shanghai, the first thing I will do is watch a film starring you." The famous Peking opera performer Mei Lanfang was also present. Mr. Mei and Mr. Chaplin had met in Hollywood several years ago. Chaplin patted Mei on the shoulder with both hands and said, "It has only been a few years since we last met. At that time, both of us had black hair, but now my hair is gray, while your hair is still completely black. Could it be that you will never have a single white hair?" He laughed heartily. Then, Mr. Mei and Mr. Chaplin went to the Xinguang Grand Theater to watch a play. Mr. Chaplin immediately responded without hesitation, saying, "This is indeed something that I find immensely interesting," and so on.</p>
<h3>Shen Yanling's Heart is Too Hard; Why Sever the Mother-Son Relationship? Cheng Yuzhen Asks to See Her Sons Three Times a Month, With No Other Motive; She Weeps as She States Her Case; The Argument Concludes, and the Verdict is Scheduled for the Afternoon of the 14th</h3>
<p>Shen Yanling, a native of Wu County residing at 243 Gordon Road, once took the famous courtesan Cheng Yuzhen as his concubine. After she bore him three sons in succession, he severed their relationship. Subsequently, Cheng sued Shen twice because he did not allow her and her sons to meet, considering it illegal. Now, she is persisting and again suing Shen in the First Special District Local Court. On the 24th of last month, Judge Peng opened the court, but both parties did not appear in person, so the hearing was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held, but the defendant again claimed illness and did not appear. According to the plaintiff, Cheng Yuzhen, she was taken as Shen Yanling's concubine at the age of fifteen and lived with him in Jiufu Lane, Mondeland Road, while Shen's family was in Fengji Lane on the Great World Road. She separated from Shen at the age of twenty-three, after bearing him three sons, now eleven, ten, and seven years old, all of whom are currently in school. Shen's principal wife had no children. She lived with Shen for nine years, but never went to Shen's house. The reason for the separation was that Shen did not provide support and never visited Jiufu Lane, so she lived by borrowing money. Therefore, Shen made an agreement to separate from her and gave her 10,000 yuan to pay off debts. The three sons born to them were immediately taken away by Shen. However, she only knew that the relationship as husband and concubine was severed. Later, she learned that the relationship between mother and sons was also severed, and that was when she started the lawsuits. It has been five years since she saw her sons. She continued, sobbing, as tears streamed down her face, that she now requested permission to visit her sons at Shen's house three times a month until she died, and proposed that Sunday afternoons be the time for the mother and sons to meet, so as not to interfere with the three sons' studies. Furthermore, she had to visit on the three sons' birthdays, and she had no other requests. The defendant's lawyer, representing the defendant, stated the reasons for opposing the plaintiff's request, saying that of the three sons born to the plaintiff, one son was raised by Shen's wife, and the other two sons were with the plaintiff. When the separation agreement was signed, the plaintiff only cared about money and did not want her sons, so Shen gave 10,000 yuan and the agreement stated that the mother-son relationship was severed. Before the ink was dry, the plaintiff regretted it and repeatedly brought lawsuits, now for the third time, and each time she filed a lawsuit and asked people to mediate. The purpose is not difficult to imagine. The plaintiff came from a prostitute's background. When she lived with Shen, she was not allowed to enter Shen's house. Now that they have been separated for a long time, she is even less allowed to go. Moreover, the three sons are all young, and the defendant is responsible for their guardianship. If she is allowed to visit, and she takes the opportunity to take the sons away, what will happen? Fortunately, the result of the first lawsuit determined that the mother-son relationship existed. It seems that the sons can meet their mother when they reach adulthood, and the defendant really cannot allow them to meet at present. The plaintiff's lawyer retorted that the separation agreement was obtained by deception, that only Shen's lawyer was present, and the plaintiff did not participate. Shen's intentions are evident from this. If the plaintiff really agreed, she would not have filed a lawsuit to confirm the invalidity of the contract one month after signing. The purpose of the second lawsuit was to request alimony, and this time she is only requesting to meet, which is by no means a repeated lawsuit. Moreover, before this lawsuit, he had asked her what her purpose was, whether it was nominally to meet her sons but actually to hope for money. The plaintiff cried bitterly because she missed her sons, and vowed that she had no intention of using it as a pretext for anything, and that was when he accepted the commission. As for the defendant's reason for not allowing the plaintiff to meet her sons, because the plaintiff came from a prostitute's background, if she entered Shen's house, it would definitely cause unrest in his family, and there was also the worry that she would take the sons away. All of these arguments are not enough to counter the plaintiff's request. If it is said to wait until the sons reach adulthood, it is as difficult as waiting for the Yellow River to run clear. Therefore, the plaintiff's request is not only legal but also reasonable, and a judgment should be made according to the law. After both sides finished their arguments, Judge Peng ordered that the verdict be announced on the afternoon of the 14th of this month.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Murder: Li Yisan Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The major robbery and murder case in Zhabei was ordered by the court to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. On the afternoon of the 24th of last month, at 6:30 p.m., two robbers with weapons broke into the home of Lu Shide at 584 Chedajiao, Gordon Road, intending to rob. At that time, Lu's younger brother, Lu San, was in the bedroom. Hearing the alarm, he came out to investigate and was shot by the robbers, hitting a vital spot and killing him on the spot. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the two robbers turned to flee, but were caught by Lu Shide's son, Lu Xuewu, who grabbed Li Yisan, a native of Jiangbei, one of the robbers who fired the gun, along with a pistol, and handed them over to the Indian police, who took them to the Gordon Road Police Station. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives captured another suspect, Mei Shitian, and brought him to the First Special District Court. After clear confessions, the court ordered the sentence. The details of the case have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the Eighth Criminal Division and announced the verdict: Li Yisan, carrying a weapon, jointly broke into the house at night for robbery, resulting in death, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life. Mei Shitian was found not guilty. After the announcement, an investigator from the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted a case, stating that it was found that the two defendants, Li and Mei, had committed a major robbery and murder case at 12 Songshan Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, on the 12th of last month. Therefore, he requested permission to transfer them. Judge Wu ordered Li Yisan to be handed over to the personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be taken back, and the pistol and bullets were sent along with him. Mei Shitian was released on bail pending further summons and ordered to report to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Over Watching a Peep Show: Chen Shaoliang Brandishes a Gun as a Threat; Surrounded and Unable to Escape, He is Eventually Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Shaoliang, 21 years old, a native of Suzhou; Yuan Yunqing, 22 years old; and Ling Shouxin, 22 years old, a local resident, are all employed as detectives or translators in a certain agency in the French Concession of this city. The night before last, the three of them made an appointment to watch a play at a certain theater. When the play ended and the audience dispersed, it was already midnight. They then went together for a late-night snack. However, feeling that their enjoyment was not yet complete and having nowhere to go, they suddenly had a whimsical idea and agreed to go watch a peep show. After the three of them had eaten their fill, they took three rickshaws and went straight to No. 1, Lane 272, Haining Road. After negotiating the price, they agreed on a total fee of 2 yuan and 40 cents, which was to be paid in advance. Chen and the others paid the amount in full and sat down to watch. When the show ended, Chen and the others had lost interest and were about to leave. Unexpectedly, the madam of the den suddenly wanted to demand double the usual tip from Chen and the others. One side firmly refused to pay, which led to a dispute. In the midst of the stalemate, Jiang Asheng, the rickshaw driver hired by the den, suddenly stepped forward and blocked the way, creating a threatening situation. Seeing that the situation was not good, Chen Shaoliang could not help but become anxious and took out his service pistol from his waist to threaten Jiang Asheng and the others. Unexpectedly, Jiang Asheng, upon seeing the pistol, ran frantically downstairs, shouting for help, which alarmed the nearby neighbors and others who came to inquire. As a result, Chen and the others were surrounded and unable to escape. Before long, a patrolman happened to pass by the area and took both parties to the police station for further disposition.</p>
<h3>Land Subsidence on Datong Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>At around 3 p.m. yesterday, the land on Datong Road, Zhabei (south of Xinjiang Road), suddenly subsided, forming a large hole in the middle of the road. Looking at the road surface, the ground below had subsided, like an eggshell. Fortunately, the police officer on duty there became aware of it and immediately reported it to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works by telephone. The Bureau sent personnel to investigate and, in addition to blocking vehicles and pedestrians to avoid danger, immediately reported back to the Bureau and dispatched workers to fill the hole and facilitate traffic. It is said that the reason for the land subsidence was that the roadbed was not firmly filled when the road was originally built.</p>

<h3>Wife Taken, But Husband Beaten Instead: Yu Qunlou Petitions the Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yu Qunlou's wife, Yu Zhangshi (26 years old), of Zhangjiangzha, Pudong, secretly fled without a trace in February of last year. Only recently did Yu Qunlou discover that his runaway wife was hiding in the home of a Mr. Lu in Sanxuhang, Zhenru, and was living with him. He went to the address and found her there. However, she was heavily pregnant and about to give birth. Yu wanted to take her back, but Mr. Lu stepped forward to obstruct him, accusing Yu of impersonating his wife, and beat and insulted him. Yu felt that his wife had been seized by another man, but he was beaten instead when he tried to retrieve her, which was difficult to accept. He filed a petition with the Procuratorate of the Local Court, requesting an investigation and the release of Zhangshi to him. After receiving the petition, Judge Xie Lian ordered both parties to appear in court for questioning and handling according to the law.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Inn: Two Extortionist Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Ye Yusi, a detective's assistant, learned at around 8 p.m. last night that robbers were hiding in Room 20 of the Wuzhou Inn at No. 4, Lane 295, Wuzhou Road. They secretly went to arrest them in coordination with a Western detective. They arrested two men from Anhui, Li Zhongquan and Liu Xianshao, in the room, and seized a pistol and five bullets, which were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Bureau of Public Works, described the situation and stated that it was found that these people, along with an escaped person surnamed Xu, had written a threatening letter and sent it to the owner surnamed Wang of the Gongxing Iron Factory on Linqing Road, extorting 30,000 yuan, and arranged to meet on Mayu Mountain Road to hand over the money, otherwise they would use a pistol to kill them. He requested a postponement of the case for further investigation. Detective Shao and Detective's Assistant Ye reported the details of the case and presented the pistol and bullets for inspection. When questioned, Li Zhongquan confessed that he was invited to the inn by a person surnamed Xu. At first, he did not know what was happening. Then, he was asked to write a letter to the Gongxing Iron Factory demanding 10,000 yuan. This letter was written the night before last and sent to the mailbox on the road by a person named Xiaojin Lin, a native of Tongzhou, who is currently at large. They were supposed to negotiate behind the towel factory on Mayu Mountain Road. He did not go. This matter involved Liu Xianshao, the escaped Xu, and Xiaojin Lin, a total of four people. Liu Xianshao confessed that he was also invited by a person surnamed Xu, and the pistol was borrowed by him from a friend for appraisal. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled a further investigation in seven days.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Student Hu Peihuan's Purse Snatching Case Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hu Peihuan, a female student at Fudan University, had her purse snatched by a robber at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Shanxi Road at around 7 p.m. on January 20 of this year. A Chinese policeman No. 2211 from the General Patrol Bureau helped to chase after him. The policeman fired four shots because the fleeing robber did not obey the order to stop and reached into his bag, killing him. Now, the family of the deceased, Sun Dayuan, Sun Fei, has filed a petition with the First Special District Court, accusing the policeman No. 2211 of murder. The First Special District Court has summoned him once. The police station has refused to accept the summons for the policeman and has not prepared a case transfer form. Sun Fei is unable to stay in Shanghai for long due to living conditions, so she has filed a petition to withdraw the lawsuit. The court believes that this case should be investigated, so it ordered a postponement and another summons after the last hearing. The details of the case have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., Judge Liu Yugui of the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court continued the hearing. Sun Fei and the Chinese policeman No. 2211 had not arrived yet. The witness Hu Peihuan was absent due to school exams and was represented by Qi Huwushi. A clerk from Yuezhong Guihua Perfume Shop, Guo Xinxin, was also unable to attend because he recently fell from a building and was seriously injured, and was represented by his colleague Zhou Xihua. A clerk from Hongchang Cigarette Paper Shop, Yu Xinkang, personally attended the court. Hu Wushi stated that on that day, she and Hu Peihuan were shopping at the Sanyou Industrial Company. Peihuan was in front, and she was behind. When they passed Guanshengyuan, a robber in a blue cloth short shirt came forward and snatched Peihuan's handbag. Peihuan chased after him. She was too frightened to know what happened after the policeman fired his gun. However, the clothes and figure of the deceased seemed similar to the robber. Yu Xinkang testified that he saw a person running out of Huajin Lane, followed by many people, but he did not see the face clearly. He only heard rumors and did not witness it himself. Judge Liu stated that Hu Peihuan still had to be summoned to court for questioning and ordered the hearing to be postponed to the 17th.</p>
<h3>Chen Jinming Kicks Over a Cradle, Infant Dies</h3>
<p>Cai San, a 42-year-old native of Haimen, who lives at No. 13, Renle Lane, Caojiazhai, works as a cart pusher. Last month, he owed Chen Jinming, a fellow villager, 6 yuan and 50 cents. He repeatedly demanded the money, but to no avail. At 10:45 p.m. the night before last, Chen came to Cai's place again to demand the money, and a conflict broke out between them, resulting in a brawl in the living room. Cai's cohabitant, Xing Cailin, had a two-year-old son, Chunguan, who was sleeping in a cradle. Chen accidentally kicked over the cradle, and Chunguan fell to the ground from the cradle. He was so frightened that he did not make a sound and died at 8 a.m. yesterday morning. Xing Cailin reported the matter to the Caojiadu Public Security Branch, who arrested Cai and Chen and brought them to the case for questioning and handling.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Woman Found Chopped to Death on Rue Pottier Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The woman living on the mezzanine floor of the living room at No. 132 Rue Pottier in the French Concession, whose surname and origin are unknown, was about 25 or 26 years old and was heavily addicted to opium. Suddenly, yesterday morning, while the woman was still asleep, she was slashed more than ten times on her left cheek with a kitchen knife, the deepest being three or four inches, two times on her right leg, breaking her leg bone, and her left middle finger was also chopped off. She died instantly. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. The murderer was silent when committing the crime, so the people living with her did not hear any noise. It was not until around 10 a.m. that Ms. Gu Ding, a woman from Shandong who lived on the front floor, went downstairs. When she reached the mezzanine floor, she saw the door of the room open and bloodstains on the bedding and floor. The smell of blood was overwhelming. She found that the woman had been chopped to death in bed and informed the landlord, Ji Lishi (32 years old, from Shandong), who reported the matter to the Xiafei Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and seized a murder weapon (and found a set of opium paraphernalia next to the deceased's pillow). They inquired about the landlord and found out the name and age of the deceased's lover. However, the deceased had no family, so it was impossible to know her surname. The body was transported to the mortuary of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. The police station ordered detectives to investigate the murderer (name temporarily withheld). In the afternoon at 3 p.m., they reported to the Second Special District Court, and the chief prosecutor, accompanied by a forensic doctor and a recorder, arrived at the scene to confirm that the unnamed female corpse had died from knife wounds. The corpse was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. The murderer is being strictly investigated by the Police Department. It is reported that this case was caused by a quarrel between brothers over a mistress. The police are currently investigating and have detained the deceased's lover's father, ordering him to hand over the murderer. The truth will soon be revealed.</p>

The god-child Hua Dan Li Huimin Yin Wenzhao's kind of mixed sadness and joy is difficult to compare even for adult Kunling, which is really commendable. There are also Li Huisen and Huilan's little monks, who are funny and make people laugh at first sight. Participating in the performance is like icing on the cake. It is expected that when the three episodes are performed, the full sign of the hao will be hung high every night.</p>

<h3>Medical Field</h3>
<p>The Famous Doctor Fang Gongpu's Treatment Continues The famous doctor Fang Gongpu of Chaoyang is a descendant of Fang Xiaoru, a sage of the Ming Dynasty. He has learned extensively from the past and present, and has rich experience. He has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years and has saved countless lives. A few days ago, he treated Mr. Ma Qizhou, a famous painter, for a severe disease. The disease was very serious and the doctors were helpless.

<h3>Report of the Guangdong and Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group (II)</h3>
<p>— Sent from the Boat</p>
<p>Group Research and Discussions on the Boat</p>
<p>The members of the group had the opportunity to conduct in-depth research during the smooth and calm boat journey. Upon the suggestion of the group leader, they were divided into three groups: currency system, tax rules, and industrial cooperation. Each group consisted of eleven members, with the group leader serving as the convener. The currency system group focused on stabilizing the exchange rate between Shanghai and Guangdong, aiming for a difference of no more than three percent. They also hoped for a balance in the exchange rate between Guangdong and Guangxi and urged the authorities to crack down on illegal manipulation of exchange rates. The tax rules group studied the tax rules for foreign and domestic goods in both provinces, hoping for distinct regulations. The industrial cooperation group emphasized the close relationships between Guangdong and Guangxi in terms of exporting goods, collecting raw materials, and exchanging necessities. They hoped that through this trip, they could exchange ideas and find ways to promote trade, benefiting both sides.</p>
<p>An Unexpected Encounter with Mr. Wu Ting on the Boat</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is from Rong County, Guangxi. He has been involved in politics in Guangxi for many years and has achieved significant results in construction and rural development. He was recently appointed as the Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province and was about to take office. However, he was in mourning for his late mother and was returning home to handle the funeral arrangements. This provided an opportunity for conversation. The reporter inquired about the industrial conditions in Guangxi. Mr. Wu stated that the industry of a province is based on three points: raw materials, transportation, and sales. Guangxi is currently focusing on these three areas, hoping for development in the near future, but it is not yet possible to talk about industry. The three major goals of self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency put forward by the Guangxi provincial authorities are easier to achieve in terms of self-defense and self-government. However, self-sufficiency is easier said than done. Today, it is clearly felt that self-sufficiency is indeed difficult to achieve at the provincial level. Even for a country, it is very difficult except in cases related to national defense or under special circumstances. However, by thinking and striving for production in various ways, it may be a way to overcome national difficulties. It is also important to encourage sideline occupations and improve handicrafts. As for larger industries, it is better to invite enthusiastic entrepreneurs to join in cooperation than to rely on the power of government agencies. However, the socialization of production and the welcoming of foreign investment are still research questions. His insightful views were admired by all. Mr. Wu strongly urged the group members to return to Shanghai via Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang after visiting Guangxi, so that the trip could provide observations from five provinces, which would be more valuable. On the boat, we also met Mr. Tang Shaochang, a councilor of the Hankou Municipal Government, who highly praised the development of the Guangxi militia, which trains 50,000 people every year. Currently, there are 400,000 people in the province, all of whom are young people around the age of twenty. They start training every morning, and are proficient in fencing, martial arts, and target practice. These young people are all employed and are concentrated for training in Wuming. Their vigorous spirit is admirable. Mr. Tang also stated that there are no bandits or beggars in Guangxi, which shows the achievements of self-government and self-defense. If an outlet for economic self-sufficiency can be found, the future prospects are unlimited. All of this is reference material for the inspection group before visiting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Securities Industry</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit Information</p>
<p>(A Summary of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 17) History</p>
<p>The rise of Shanghai's securities industry can be divided into three stages. The first is the tea house era before 1914. The second is the guild era before 1920. The third is the current exchange era. These are explained separately below.</p>
<p>The securities industry in the tea house era rose in 1912. The nationalization of the Stein Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway and the issuance of the six-cent public bonds in 1912 led to a surge in securities trading. As a result, the term "stock broker" also emerged. Initially, there were only two or three people, but by 1914, the number had increased to more than ten. The transaction methods and prices were largely determined freely by the brokers, with no standards. This was because most buyers and sellers did not fully understand the nature and value of the securities, and the general public lacked confidence in various securities. Therefore, sellers were willing to get rid of the securities as soon as possible, without worrying about the high or low market value. Therefore, the transaction method was also very simple. There were no fixed bids or sales, and there were no term transactions. Therefore, the brokers engaged in the securities industry did not have any regulations on the small collection of commissions, and the operating entities were also very complex. There were money merchants, tea merchants, leather merchants, antique merchants, and grocery merchants. It was truly a new professional group formed by a variety of colors. Although what is described above is only a page in history, it is sufficient for studying the securities business. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Report of Our Country's Representative Attending the International Astronomical Union in Paris</h3>
<p>On July 10th of last year, the International Astronomical Union held a meeting in Paris. Our country sent two representatives to attend. After the meeting, the attending representative, Gao Pingzi (Jun), reported the proceedings of the meeting to the Ministry of Education. The original text was very long. The main points are as follows: "Number of Attendees" included 10 Germans, 2 Austrians, 25 from various countries, 6 Canadians, 2 Chinese, 1 Vatican representative, 8 Danes, 1 Egyptian, 12 Spaniards, 1 Estonian, 36 Americans, 149 French, 89 British, 21 Dutch, 1 Indian, 21 Italians, 2 Japanese, 2 Norwegians, 5 Poles, 6 Portuguese, 16 Romanians, 7 Swedes, 6 Swiss, 10 Czechs, 8 Soviets, totaling 441 people from 25 countries. (The number of invitees included both formal members and observers. The number of formal members varied from country to country, depending on the number of members in each country's astronomical committee.)</p>
<p>Meeting Overview: The first decision of the meeting was a plenary session, which was quite grand but also largely ceremonial. The President of France attended, with the Minister of Education presiding. Four speakers gave speeches. The International Time Bureau, affiliated with the Paris Observatory, used film to demonstrate time measurement and reporting, with explanations from the director. After the demonstration, the meeting adjourned. On the last day, the morning plenary session involved passing resolutions from various subgroups, with reading and passing done quickly and with very little discussion, which was also largely ceremonial. The afternoon plenary session consisted of speeches by incoming and outgoing officers. The election of all officers was decided by the board of directors and did not take place at the meeting. The same was true for the election of committee members in each subgroup. In addition, it was announced that the next general assembly would be held in Stockholm, Sweden, and that the president-elect for the next session would be Mr. Esclangon, the director of the Paris Observatory. Between the two plenary sessions were subgroup meetings, tours, and receptions. The reception at the Paris Observatory on the 10th was a social event, without instrument viewing. Subgroup meetings, visits, and banquets were held on the 13th, 15th, and 16th. The plenary session on the morning of the 17th passed the resolutions of the various subgroups, and the afternoon plenary session also included the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>The astronomical exhibition was located below the meeting hall. The exhibits consisted of instruments, photographs, star charts, and diagrams. The materials were not very extensive. Our country brought albums from the Purple Mountain Observatory, which were also displayed in a case. After the meeting, they were transferred to the French Astronomical Society for preservation.</p>
<p>Various proposals were discussed in the subgroup meetings. According to regulations, all proposals had to be sent to the secretariat five months before the start of the general assembly, printed in a draft booklet, and distributed to all members. Our country had not yet joined the association and had not prepared any proposals. Moreover, the meeting time for each group was short, no more than one or two hours. It was impossible to make impromptu proposals. However, during the subgroup meetings, attendees could freely choose to participate, in order to understand the current state of progress in various branches of astronomy and the direction to be taken in the future.</p>
<p>This time, the two representatives from our country participated in the meetings of the following groups: Group 10 (Sunspots), Group 11 (Chromospheric Phenomena), Group 12 (Solar Radiation and Spectrum), Group 13 (Eclipses), Group 18 (Longitude), Group 27 (Variable Stars), and Group 31 (Time Bureaus). The nature of the meetings focused on facts and collaborative matters, such as requests for funding, allocation of observation sites and times, selection of observation methods and instruments, and standardization of terminology, symbols, and printed materials. Matters pertaining solely to academic theories and individual research problems unrelated to cooperation were not within the scope of discussion, nor was there time to present papers. This is a point that our country should pay attention to when attending in the future. If academic theories must be explained in the proposals, they should be as concise as possible so as not to take up too much time.</p>
<p>For example, in the Sunspot Group, the Spanish representative proposed counting sunspots separately for the eastern and western halves of the solar surface, and for the northern and southern halves, based on his personal research that the number of sunspots differed in each half. His preliminary result was that the number of sunspots in the western hemisphere was often less than in the eastern hemisphere. When the Earth is in the north, the southern hemisphere has more sunspots than the northern hemisphere, and vice versa when the Earth is in the south. He suggested that this was all influenced by the Earth, hence the proposal to count them separately. This type of proposal inevitably requires discussing the theory first, and delving into theory wastes time. Therefore, the explanation of his one proposal took up almost 80% of the meeting time, which shows that there was no time for purely academic papers.</p>
<p>The Variable Star Group (Group 27) discussed increasing committee members and regional observation, saying that many variable star charts were available for use, and requesting special attention to various types of variable stars. Someone proposed a full-scale regional watch for new stars, but no resolution was made.</p>
<p>The main topics discussed in the Eclipse Group (Group 13) were reports from representatives of Japan and the Soviet Union on the local conditions along the path of the 1936 solar eclipse and plans for observation teams. Japan planned to observe in Hokkaido, while the Soviet Union planned to organize five or six observation teams in Siberia. Based on this, our country must conduct an early investigation of local climate and other conditions for the solar eclipse in 1941 in order to submit a report.</p>
<p>The Chromospheric Phenomena Group (Group 11) discussed the definition of flares and the problem of increasing the recording of explosive dark filaments. Important resolutions included: First, to strive to improve the use of solar spectrographs and install this type of instrument at suitable locations to facilitate useful observations around Greenwich Mean Time; Second, to observe eruptive prominences every three to five minutes, using instruments such as the Deslandres solar spectroheliograph with a line-of-sight velocity recorder, or a combined solar spectroscope and spectrograph for visual or photographic observations, or B-Lyot-style direct or cinematographic photographic observations. It is best to use all three methods simultaneously to determine which method is most suitable under the specific climatic conditions of a particular observatory. In addition, each group had proposals for funding requests. After each group made a decision, it was then sent to the Economic Committee for approval.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief overview of the meeting situation in each group. A detailed record of the proposals will be published in the official report of the general assembly.</p>
<p>Also, although international conferences can use multiple internationally accepted languages, according to this experience, only English and French are actually used. Those speaking English have French translations, and those speaking French have English translations. In Europe, the use of French seems to be more common than English. This situation can serve as a mirror for our country's future attendees.</p>
<p>Our Country Formally Joins the International Astronomical Union and Elects Committee Members: Our country has not yet formally joined the International Astronomical Union. This time, the application for membership was made in the name of the Chinese Astronomical Society, because the association's charter requires membership in the name of a country, which would require first establishing an astronomical committee and the membership fee would increase according to the country's population, which would be a considerable amount. Therefore, it is more convenient to apply for membership temporarily in the name of the Chinese Astronomical Society. After the letter from the Chinese Astronomical Society was sent to the association's secretary, it was said that it would be forwarded to the board of directors for a decision. The secretary-general later sent a letter stating that the Chinese representative was invited to attend the meeting of the association's Economic Committee on the 16th. I attended the meeting on that date and explained that China's application for membership was based on the Chinese Astronomical Society as the main body, and that the Chinese Astronomical Society was a private group organized by Chinese astronomers and related organizations. Although it could represent the intentions of the Chinese astronomical community and coordinate its activities, its financial strength was quite limited, and there were some difficulties with the membership fee, which could be handled flexibly. The committee members replied that there should be no problem with China's membership, and that the difficult situation of the Chinese Astronomical Society was understandable. The membership fee could be temporarily waived, but it was hoped that it could be joined in the name of the government in the future so that the membership fee could be paid accordingly. According to the association's regulations, the country with the largest population should pay eight units of membership fees. The unit was previously 400 gold francs. The Economic Committee proposed that it be changed to 300 gold francs per unit after the budget, which has been approved. The funding approved by the various subgroup meetings was also sent to the Economic Committee for final approval. Since China has joined, it should have the right to be elected as a member of the subgroups. Therefore, the list of candidates was sent in the name of the Chinese Astronomical Society and given to the Secretary-General of the Association. As a result, three people were elected: Gao Lu (Group 3 Nomenclature and Symbols), Yu Qingsong (Group 12 Solar Radiation and Spectrum, Group 36 Spectral Photometry), Jiang Neiran (Group 18 Longitude).</p>

<h3>The Chinese Arts Education Society Cables the Ministry of Education to Restore the Number of Arts Education Hours in Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>Telegrams to Art Teachers Nationwide Urge Joint Efforts, Meeting of Art Teachers in Shanghai on the 12th to Discuss</p>
<p>Standards, reducing the number of teaching hours for art subjects, which is considered not only to hinder the progress of art education but also to violate educational principles, greatly affecting education and national culture. The association, with its responsibilities, finds it difficult to remain silent, so it convened its 11th board meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Directors Shi Peng, Wu Kechang, Fu Boliang, Zhu Zhiwei, Wang Yungong, Shi Wenbin, Zhu Yunsong, Zhang Meisun, Shen Lü, Ma Gongyu, He Mingzhai, supervisors Xie Gongzhan, Yu Jifan, etc., were present.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: The meeting was chaired by Wu Kechang, the managing director, with Zhu Zhiwei as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 1932. In junior high school, manual arts were two hours per week in the first and second grades and four hours per week in the third grade, but after revision, it was reduced by two hours. Drawing was two hours per week in the first and second grades, but now it is reduced by one hour. Music was two hours in the first grade, but now it is reduced by one hour. In senior high school, drawing was one hour per week in the first grade, but now it is reduced by half an hour, and two hours per week in the second and third grades, but now it is reduced by half an hour.</p>
<p>Resolution to Strive: This revision of the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, reducing the number of teaching hours for art, not only hinders the progress of art education but also violates educational principles. Two resolutions were passed: 1. Telegraph the Ministry of Education to promptly restore the original number of teaching hours for art subjects to maintain art education. 2. Telegram art teachers and art organizations in primary and secondary schools nationwide to strive for joint efforts, and appoint Shi Chongpeng, Ma Gongyu, and Wu Kechang to draft the telegram.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting: In view of the importance of the issue, the association has scheduled a tea party for 1:00 PM on the 12th of this month (Thursday) at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Amiral Meru in the French Concession of this city, inviting art teachers and art experts from primary and secondary schools throughout the city to gather and discuss. The association has already sent out notices, but fearing that the time is short and the notices may not be comprehensive, all art teachers in the city are welcome to participate freely.</p>

<p>It is still difficult to be optimistic about the future before encountering strong teams. Although Donghua lost once, the hope of winning the championship is still high.</p>
<p>In order to expedite the conclusion of the Western League Football Tournament, the number of games has been increased since last week, reaching as many as 38. There are also 30 games this week. The situation in each group has changed to some extent. Among Group A, only the French Business and Youyou teams remain undefeated, and their momentum is the strongest. Although Donghua is in sixth place with eight points, their strength is not weak. Although Youyou is currently in second place, they have not yet encountered strong teams, and their performance in the match with Socar the day before yesterday was average. It is impossible to be optimistic about their future. In Group B, the Youth Team still holds the top spot without major changes. The situation in each group is listed on the right.</p>

<h3>Statement from the Nanhua Small Football Team</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I write to you directly. In today's publication of your esteemed newspaper, regarding the news of the Pudong Small Football Association, there are mentions of our team that are severely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I will record the details as follows: "Our team's match against Shixin was held on the 23rd of last month, at which time our team won with a score of 3-0. After the match, Shixin players raised unnecessary issues, claiming that our team had ineligible players participating in the match. The referee, Huang Bingxing, verified each player individually, and there were no objections. The reason for this is that Shixin is the fundamental team of the Pudong Small Football Association, and they have long regarded the championship as their exclusive property. Now that Shixin was suddenly defeated by our team, they fabricated facts, claiming that there was an impersonation incident on our team and ruled that our team lost. However, if impersonation were indeed a fact, according to the regulations, our team's qualification to compete should be revoked. Why was our team only ruled to have lost? Furthermore, if there was an impersonator, his name should have been pointed out. Why do they vaguely claim to revoke his individual qualification? Who is this person whose qualification is being revoked? These two points alone are clear evidence of fabricated facts. In conclusion, there are many dark secrets within the association. They feign promoting sports under a beautiful name, but in reality, they are engaging in the practices of petty merchants. In addition to having submitted the above-mentioned facts to the association, we also request that you grant us a letter to correct this. We would be immensely grateful. With this, we respectfully wish you good health. Sincerely, The Huazhi Small Football Team, March 10th."</p>
<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(9)(6)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The golden-haired child had already been taken away by the aunt from Sichuan. Her father was greatly surprised. He wondered, was suspicious, and was eager to know, "what on earth was going on." His astonishment was obviously greater than that of Mr. Bell.</p>
<p>After much rustling and banging, and all sorts of clearly discernible commands from the old backstage manager, finally, the curtain rose slowly along with the melodious music. All that could be seen was little Patty – that is, the golden-haired child – sitting on a tiny stool next to a stove made of yellow paper. We had never seen a more adorable little Cinderalla; (Note 5) because her gray robe was very tattered, and her tiny shoes were already broken, but her face, lit by bright hair, was very beautiful, while her expression was very dejected, so everyone who saw this little actress, out of pity, after smiling, even shed tears. She sat quietly until a voice gently said, "Come now!" – whereupon she gave a funny sigh and said, "Oh, I wish, oh, I could go to that dance!" She said it so naturally that her father clapped his hands, and her mother cried out "Little darling!" They so involuntarily revealed their feelings that Cinderalla herself forgot herself, shaking her head and saying to them in a reproving tone, "You mustn't speak to me."</p>
<p>(Note 5) Cinderella is a popular Western folk tale that tells the story of a beautiful girl from a poor family who is abused by her stepmother. A fairy helps her to go to a dance, where she is favored by a prince. He pursues her in haste, and she leaves behind a small slipper. The prince seeks all the women, saying that whoever can wear it suitably will be his bride. Although the women try to cut off their feet to fit the slipper, it is of no use, and only Cinderella can wear it. Therefore, he marries her.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Debt Positions Exceed Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange continued to weaken. Although the fourth type of bond was slightly raised, it was not effective at all. This was because internal and external troubles were pressing in. Internally, the issue of autonomy recently arose again in Fujian. Externally, the situation in Europe was becoming increasingly tense. People were deeply impressed by the year 1936, and they became even more apprehensive upon hearing this. However, the bond market, in this season of multiple troubles, was still a fleeting opportunity. In the past two days, the price increases had been slightly slackened, and market prices had gone downhill. In fact, trading had not increased at all, but market prices had become increasingly depressed due to oversupply. Once trading booms, there may be huge changes. It is still in the brewing period. The processes yesterday mostly weakened gradually. Although there were no huge rises and falls, there was no turnaround in the sluggishness. In the morning closing, although the fourth type of bond saw some buying, the majority raised it by one or two cents. But in the afternoon, it was still spiritless, and market prices on the floor were relaxed. The most common drop from the morning opening was one or two cents to four cents. The rest were only fluctuating by one or two cents. In terms of selling, the 16th and 47th types were more common, and the rest were still only entering and exiting sporadically. As a result, market prices continued to fall by between 0.015 and 0.07 yuan. The total number of transactions was 4,075,000 yuan. The results of its rises and falls are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan):</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Suddenly Plunge</h3>

Small exchange stocks also fell. The bond market was slightly lower. The total number of transactions for the day was 2,750,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Bulls Take Profits; Standard Yarn Market Sentiment Turns Bearish</h3>
<p>After the yarn market surged the day before, profit-taking occurred yesterday, and floor prices eased. At the same time, the Osaka Sampin yarn market also fell back by more than one yuan, so market prices turned bearish. However, the large amount of funds in the financial sector was not fully released, and spot yarn trading could still be maintained. However, the industry is still leaning towards the short side.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls Back by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with slight declines in all months. The current month re-entered the 200 yuan mark. This was because the rising trend of overseas cotton yarn had subsided, and Osaka Sampin yarn had fallen back by six or seven cents. As a result, buyers in the market were not enthusiastic, and sentiment was weak. Market prices fell back steadily. However, Changfeng still bought in, turning from short to long. As a result, all months fell by 0.06, 0.08, and 0.09 cents to 0.011 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened with tense conditions in the near months, rising by 0.06 or 0.07 cents in the far months. After the second session, it slowly fell back. Since Osaka Sampin yarn was still falling, buying sentiment was peaceful. As a result, the middle months fell by 0.03 or 0.04 cents compared to the morning closing price, while the rest remained unchanged. It was found that Dafu sold 400 packages, Chengji 1,250 packages, Dafeng 1,050 packages, Daji 1,000 packages, Yida 650 packages, Dachangcheng 1,950 packages, Runkang 700 packages, Xincheng 850 packages, Jinchang 950 packages, and Hexing 400 packages.

<h3>Cotton's Rising Trend Has Subsided; Spot Trends Are Very Good</h3>
<p>The cotton market rebounded slightly. Because the rising trend the day before was too strong, and the rising trend of overseas cotton markets had subsided, people's sentiment was peaceful, and bulls took profits. Therefore, market prices fell back to flat. However, the spot cotton situation is extremely tight. The prices of Tongzhou flower markets have risen sharply.</p>
<p>Standard Flowers Were Released by Xincheng</p>
<p>The standard flower market opened in the morning with a peaceful situation. Because US cotton spot was unchanged and forward fell by one to five pounds, Indian cotton rose sharply, with coarse velvet rising by 3.5 rupees and fine velvet rising by five rupees. However, this was expected the day before, so yesterday's telegram had little effect. Osaka Ni-hin flowers fell by 0.213 yuan. The near-month market trend was weak, falling by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. However, the buying interest was strong for the forward months, rising by 0.05 yuan. Xincheng released a large quantity in the second and third sessions, turning downwards. As a result, each month fell by 0.012 to 0.035 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened with a once-enthusiastic atmosphere. The near months rose by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan, and the far months rose by 0.01 and 0.02 yuan. After the second session, it was heard that the Indian cotton dark market had fallen by three rupees, and the market image relaxed slightly.

<h3>American Cotton's Rising Trend Was a Flash in the Pan; British and Indian Cotton Prices Rose Significantly</h3>
<p>The American cotton market opened with a sluggish situation. All months rose by five to ten pounds. Then, due to the foreign political situation, Liverpool rose. Traders and foreign merchants bought in, and market prices stepped up. Unfortunately, there was no follow-up, and the stocking office sold off March contracts. New Orleans and cotton farmers also sold short, causing market prices to fall back slightly. After a while, traders bought near-term contracts, and far-term bulls took profits. Without any development in Washington, they remain in a wait-and-see attitude. Current demand is weak, and the textile market is quiet. The Cotton Exchange estimates that the world's cotton reserves, as of the end of January, including unpicked flowers, totaled 25,661,000 bales, of which 13,374,000 bales were cotton from China and the United States, including cotton lent by the government. The same period last year was 14,502,000 bales. The closing was stable, with the spot market unchanged and the futures market ranging from unchanged to a drop of five pounds. British cotton spot rose by 11 points, and futures rose by four to seven points. Indian cotton covered shorts and futures traders bought in, encountering European exporters selling and bulls taking profits. Exports were smooth. Pingle rose by 3.25 rupees, Omu rose by 6.25 to 6.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 5.25 to 5.75 rupees. Original telegram green, (9th telegram). According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairoxi flowers on the 10th was 195 rupees, a decrease of 2.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Sampin Yarn and Flowers Fell Slightly</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 10th, Sampin futures yarn fell by 1.1 to 1.5 yuan, with the near month at 191 yuan and the far month at 191.4 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.05 to 0.4 yuan, with the near month at 61.7 yuan and the far month at 59.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Near-Term Futures Flour and Wheat Fall; Far-Term Rises</h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, each month remained stable. Although foreign wheat fell back by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan, the international situation was unpredictable. And the lessons of the European war are terrible. Grain merchants generally have high expectations. Therefore, the opening prices for near-term and far-term contracts also rose by 0.01 and 0.03 yuan, respectively. Until the afternoon opening, it was still profitable at first, but then the flour market loosened, and the inland gangs returned to sell, so the market fell back by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. The subsequent situation depends half on foreign countries and half on how the local situation of domestic new wheat is. The current wheat market does not see much delivery, and the price is slightly better by 0.02 yuan. Kaijiangbei wheat is 5.25 yuan, and Tiantai wheat is 5.22 yuan, totaling 700 packages, which were handled by the Fu and Fu families.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat, the recent shorts covered positions, and the local situation caused the needs to relax quite a bit. Supply visible last week is estimated to have decreased by 2,938,000 bushels, and Canadian wheat visible supply decreased by 1,416,000 bushels.</p>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning, and each month saw a consistent sharp rise. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago and Canada fell back by about 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. However, the market sentiment and general outside bulls, in view of the changes in the European situation, must be prepared for expansion. Therefore, floating shorts were eager to cover positions, and inland gangs and financial gangs gradually strove to enter. Therefore, although the near-term was flat, the far-term continued to rise by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. After the second session, the factory sold, falling back nearly 0.01 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, trading was still smooth. However, near-term saw bulls return to sell, and far-term saw the factory continue to hedge, so the trend was slightly weaker. As a result, the near-term fell by 0.01 yuan, and the far-term was still better by more than 0.01 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day reached more than 880,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Customers Depart; Sales Suddenly Boom; Selling Prices Step Up by 0.03 and 0.04 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's khách tiên (coarse rice) still came from the Yangtze River area. However, sales suddenly boomed. In addition to the local area, the north and south gangs all had transactions. It is said that the stocking households were the most greedy. Because all grains are rising sharply at the moment, rice prices are still relatively cheap. Therefore, it attracted the attention of stocking households. With khách stocks booming, prices gradually soared. It had already risen by about 0.02 yuan in the morning, and it continued to rise by 0.01 and 0.02 yuan in the afternoon. And the situation is still continuing to look good. A total of 3,650 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,850 packages of Hunan-Hankou-Shashi rice, and 3,500 packages of Taizhou-Shaoxing-Anqing rice were opened for sale.</p>
<p>Foreign rice trading has not been prosperous in recent days. Yesterday, local stocking households and customers all inquired. In addition to the 300 packages of huan luo rice spot that were opened, Guangtai descended and released 1,000 tons of May deliveries at a price of 5.25 yuan. This price has risen by as much as 0.45 yuan compared to the price of 4.8 yuan last week. There has been no trading in large and small jiaos (glutinous rice) for a long time. Yesterday, 1,960 packages of small jiao and 800 packages of large jiao were opened for sale. The price is gradually approaching its original price compared to last winter because the goods sold are still low. In addition, 6,100 packages of Saigon rice were shipped to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Revive and Rise</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 40 sources from various gangs arrived. The market situation was tired at first, but later, because customer demand increased, both retail and wholesale sales became active. As a result, the price of Suzhou-Tongxiang japonica rice rose by 0.1 yuan, and the price of Nanhang early rice rose by 0.12 yuan. Nearly 4,000 packages of thin rice, including Qingyan Jinwei and other gangs, were sold, and prices rose by 0.17 yuan. Du Yangjian and Yin Bian兀 both showed a good appearance.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 30 arrivals from various roads in Hexia. Each type of good in the market, such as white japonica rice store sales, turned active. The market situation was high, and prices showed a good appearance. The middle price rose by 0.12 yuan. Thin rice retail sales were also good, and prices increased. Yang Du Jian arrived less and sold actively, and prices increased by 0.12 yuan. Port customer sales continued to move, and prices were good. White yuan sales were average, and prices remained stable. The prices of other goods also increased.</p>
<h3>Non-professionals Rush to Buy; Grain Exchange Market Suddenly Becomes Lively</h3>
<p>The standard oil bean market saw fluctuating prices yesterday. The Dalian telegram showed a slight rise in one session, and actual sales were still good. However, there were no wholesale exports, so local factories and firms continued to sell. However, after the changes in the European situation, the market suddenly became lively. Customers who had previously paid attention to the gold and securities markets all turned to the grain exchange. The buying sentiment was particularly strong, and the appetite was greedier than those in the industry. Therefore, the opening prices immediately rose. Then, the factories hedged, and the market returned to flat. The closing oil price did not change much, but the bean price rose by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. In addition, the two grain and flour exchanges will be closed for one day on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Xinghai Red Sugar Opening Price Slightly Falls</h3>
<p>Opening at Twelve Dollars and Fifty Cents... Over 900 Bags Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm. The guild's quotation for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot goods was twenty-two dollars and thirty cents. There was no transaction due to the scarcity of the goods. Transit goods were seven dollars and ten cents, with slight transactions. Dongchi white sugar and locally produced cotton white sugar remained at the original prices without changes. The asking price included Jiandang offering more than 900 bags of Anhai red sugar at twelve dollars and fifty cents, slightly lower than before, due to the relatively cheaper Xinghua Mingjing red sugar from customer goods. In addition, the Chaozhou group offered more than 80 bags of Zhiyang red sugar, with the higher price at fourteen dollars and twenty cents to twenty-one and a half cents, and the next at thirteen dollars and seventy cents. Furthermore, 44 pieces of Zhichi sugar were priced at thirteen dollars and fifty cents. Additionally, ten tins of wheat straw sugar were offered at seven dollars and forty cents per picul.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Winter Mushrooms and Fragrant Mushrooms Are Not Sold Unless the Price Is Good</h3>
<p>The prices of winter mushrooms from various sources have fallen, coupled with the thinness of existing stocks. If large-scale purchases are encountered, there will be difficulties in supply. Therefore, firms holding goods are tightly holding on to them and selling carefully, so selling prices are gradually increasing. Osaka high-quality goods are at four hundred and twenty dollars, ordinary goods at four hundred dollars, and determined to be at three hundred and eighty dollars. Tunxi goods are at two hundred and forty to fifty dollars, and Lanxi goods are at two hundred and seventy to eighty dollars.</p>
<p>The arrival of fragrant mushrooms from Tunxi is not strong, and those who have stocks are taking the opportunity to hoard them, with the selling price being raised to one hundred and ninety dollars. Goods from Fujian also continue to arrive, but high-end goods are lacking, while general goods are abundant. Yesterday, the asking price was set for eight pieces of high-quality goods at one hundred and sixty-eight and a half dollars. Thirty-three pieces of general goods were priced from one hundred and fifty-five dollars to one hundred and forty-two dollars. The firms' appetite was still good, allowing them to sell everything.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gongxi Green Tea Has Active Customer Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign firms' tea market has been unusually quiet. European firms are very indifferent due to sluggish tea sales abroad. However, for Shixi green tea, many customers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places have been searching for it yesterday. It is reported that tea firms such as Xietai Xiang and Tongyixing have handled more than 800 boxes. The market price opened at fifteen dollars and fifty cents. In addition, sixty or more packages of red and green tea, flower-scented tea, and tea waste from Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places were also shipped out, with prices opening at around six dollars and forty cents.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Business in Fancy Woolens and Serge Suddenly Decreases</h3>
<p>The trade in woolens and serge was still prosperous yesterday. Local customers all had transactions. Customers from Sichuan, Jiangxi, Changsha, the capital, and other places had slightly stronger appetites. Those in North China slightly purchased. The business in fancy woolens and serge for suits has further decreased. According to the recent order bulletin from the National Government, all officials of all sizes in military, political, and academic institutions must wear Zhongshan student uniforms and are not allowed to wear suits anymore, resulting in a sudden decrease in business in fancy suit materials. Except for Shanghai, clothing stores specializing in suits in the inland areas are all showing signs of worry. However, the business in Yuanchang thick and medium-thick serge, thin plain serge, Yuanchang worsted, and plain fancy woolens is thriving.</p>
<h3>Hardware: British Hui Si Iron Shows a Sudden Surge</h3>
<p>Since the American Huishi iron was searched for by factories and hoarders, the bottom supply has been exhausted. Therefore, buyers, having no goods to buy, have no choice but to purchase those goods as substitutes. Thus, yesterday, the British Huishi iron showed a sudden surge. The city offered a total of three hundred boxes, and there were still many continuing to purchase. The market situation is such that the supply of goods cannot meet demand, so the market price is soaring, with the opening price per box having risen to thirty dollars, two dollars higher than before. However, because the situation in Europe has suddenly tightened in recent days due to Germany's abandonment of the treaty, factories in this city that actually use this product are afraid of future shortages and are all thinking of hoarding it, so the market sentiment is very good.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Sannai's Asking Price Rises by Another Dollar</h3>
<p>The sannai that the asking price party handled a few days ago has now been transported by the Haiyuan Wheel in thirty-three pieces. Samples were seen yesterday. The color and quality of the goods are inferior to the previous batch. Because of the current shortage in the market, the firms' appetite is still strong. Twenty-seven packages were immediately offered, and the price was one dollar higher than before, showing a tight trend.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Statistics on Business Suspensions in the Twenty-Fourth Year</h3>
<p>Statistics on Bankruptcies, Suspensions of Business, and Work Stoppages in Industries, Commerce, and Finance in Shanghai Last Year</p>
<p>The China Economic Statistics Research Institute is an organization dedicated to the study of economic statistics. Since its establishment more than five years ago, the institute has conducted two Shanghai industrial surveys and one national industrial census. Its publications include the preliminary report of the Shanghai Industrial Survey, the Shanghai Silk Industry Survey Report, and the Shanghai National Goods Factory Survey Record. It also publishes the Economic Statistics Monthly Journal on a monthly basis. Now, the institute has compiled statistics on bankruptcies, suspensions of business, and work stoppages in industries, commerce, and finance in Shanghai in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, which are published below:</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Tang Zenggeng)</p>
<p>Advocates of love-above-all say: Love is the flower of life, love is a milestone in the journey of life; without love, life appears dim, and life has no value.</p>
<p>Those who have lost love say: Love is a bitter brew, love is a tomb that buries one's will, making one feel boundless pain. Therefore, love is also a hammer that strikes and blasphemes the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>It is the same love, but because of the different circumstances of the two, there are two different views. In fact, whether love is the flower of life or the tomb of burying one's will, in this chaotic era, our young people abandon the confusing national affairs, family affairs, and personal problems, and are preoccupied with the gains and losses of love. This is too irrational and lacks any soul. Therefore, before all matters are fully settled, the concept of love should be completely abandoned!</p>
<h3>Green-Clad Messenger</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Green-clad messenger is another name for the postman.</p>
<p>Although our country's national territory is so vast, there is not a place with cooking smoke that has not been deeply imprinted with the footprints of the green-clad messenger. Wherever wheels and boats can reach, there are green-clad messengers, needless to say. Even in the deep mountains and valleys filled with the tracks of wild beasts, there are still green-clad messengers trekking. Now, where there are highways, everyone feels that traveling is very convenient, but few people know that one or two decades before the highways were built, green-clad messengers had already repeatedly imprinted their footprints there. Currently, in the vast Northwest, there are still many green-clad messengers driving leather rafts, pushing handcarts, or carrying burdens back and forth. Undoubtedly, the rugged road that the green-clad messenger walks on today is the roadbed for the wide and flat highway of tomorrow. This is one of the great aspects of the green-clad messenger.</p>
<p>The British say that the British flag is spread over every corner of the world, so the British flag has no sunset. But here, I dare to boldly say that the green-clad messenger has not a single second of stillness in the twenty-four hours of day and night. The daytime goes without saying. Even in the middle of the night, before dawn, there are green-clad messengers working hard at stations and wharves. In the interior, where transportation is obstructed, postal messengers deliver mail by hand, according to schedule and limited time, regardless of sunny or rainy weather, wind or snow, maintaining transportation. This is the second great aspect of the green-clad messenger.</p>
<p>The prosperity of cities and rural areas is mutually dependent. And the medium between them is the green-clad messenger. Although the green-clad messenger is not a financier, financiers rely on the green-clad messenger to circulate finances. In addition, the green-clad messenger also undertakes the mission of comforting parents with news from traveling children, delivering safe bamboo reports. Naturally, young women in their boudoirs also look forward day and night to the arrival of family letters that can comfort their longing. As for the culturally backward rural areas, the nourishment of knowledge they receive cannot be obtained without the efforts of the green-clad messenger. Without the green-clad messenger, how pitiful would our country's economy, culture, etc., decline? This is the third great aspect of the green-clad messenger.</p>
<p>Great, green-clad messenger! The green-clad messenger is truly the oldest and most hardworking construction vanguard in our country's history.</p>
<h3>Selling One's Wife</h3>
<p>— Miao Shen</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Chinese feudal society has never regarded women as human beings. When a girl is born from her mother's womb, everyone sighs, and this determines the girl's miserable fate for life! Women are always appendages of men. Of course, wives are appendages of husbands. Even the views of ordinary women themselves are that marrying a husband is nothing more than marrying a lifelong patron! Therefore, those who are qualified to be patrons of others naturally marry wives; when they are no longer able to be patrons, the wife who is dependent by nature is likely to waver.</p>
<h3>All Other Professions Are Inferior</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>However, in the upper class, due to the rise of the old ethical forces, although the wife's heart is wavering, she does not dare to act differently because "ten eyes are watching and ten fingers are pointing." Only in the lower class, because they are not restricted by the forces of the old ethics, can they do whatever they want. If they do not have the power to be patrons of others, they can let their wives go with others. As for wives, they are not ashamed of marrying again, so the practice of selling wives has always been very popular in the lower class.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of Zhejiang, there is also a custom of pawning one's wife. For example, if the husband is unable to support his wife, he can pawn her to someone else, which can reduce the burden on the one hand, and also bring in some money on the other hand. Pawning is of course different from selling. Pawning a wife must have a time limit. After the time limit expires, she can naturally be redeemed. Some people are trapped by economics, but the couple has deep feelings. After pawning, there is still a day for broken mirrors to be reunited. Pawning is naturally much better than selling, but it sounds a bit strange to those who don't often hear about it. As for the person who accepts the pawn, of course, he is also a poor person! He cannot afford to marry a wife, but he is afraid of the interruption of his descendants. Without spending much money, he can pawn someone else's existing wife, and the son born within the time limit can be used as the incense to pass on the lineage. However, in this regard, we cannot help but sympathize with the woman's tragic situation: women are completely commodified!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Four: Valuing Profit Over Beauty, the Rough Fellow Reluctantly Gives Up Love; With Lofty Ambitions and Strong Feet, the Brave Man Ventures into the Wilderness</p>
<p>Old Man Zhang stood and listened quietly, and sure enough, he heard Hu's sister-in-law shouting in the yard. He said, "Will money bite your hand? These days, having money makes you a nobleman, and not having money makes you a commoner. What's so bad about being a concubine? You're not stealing from anyone, you're not robbing from anyone, you're just relying on your own body to rely on someone else for food and clothing. What's wrong with that? Humph! If you go to carry a gun and become a bandit, you can become a commander in the future." When Zhixian heard this, he nodded repeatedly. He hadn't paid attention yet, but Old Man Zhang was no longer in front of him. He only heard him shouting from afar. "We Xi'an people have lost all face because of you. If you try to take that girl away again, I'll report you for trafficking in human beings." At the same time, he also heard Hu's sister-in-law retort, and the sound became farther and farther away. Zhixian has always used an objective eye to observe social trends. Because of this, he never puts other people's gains and losses in his heart. But today's situation is a bit strange. He always feels that something is not right about the North Sea affair. Therefore, after Old Man Zhang left, and he could no longer hear Old Man Zhang's voice, he was still walking back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back. After walking for a while, he put his hands in front of him, but used his right fist to hit the palm of his left hand: tilting his head, or thinking for a while, nodding, or thinking carefully for a while. Sometimes he didn't walk back and forth, but sat down and poured a bowl of tea to drink. However, he poured the tea into the teacup, but didn't pick it up to drink, just staring at it blankly. After hesitating like this for almost two hours, a good news came to comfort him for a moment, that is, Li Shilian, a traveler in this courtyard, walked in with a smile. Zhixian has always held a contemptuous attitude towards him, so he doesn't welcome him to come to the room to chat. But at this time, he suddenly came in, and he couldn't stop him, so he had to smile at him and say, "Please sit down, please sit down," according to the usual politeness. As soon as Li Shilian sat down on the chair, he stood up again and bowed twice in a row, saying, "I really have something to discuss with Mr. Gan, and I have to come. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother you." When Zhixian heard these words, his eyebrows almost came together, but he immediately thought that he shouldn't offend people, so he smiled and said, "Brother doesn't understand anything. If you discuss things with brother, I'm afraid you won't get the point." (414)</p>
<h3>What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Yi Zhen)</p>
<p>One day, after I finished breakfast and was brushing my teeth, I looked at the rain and snow flying outside the window. Suddenly, I heard a tragic cry. Curious, I immediately went out of the house in the rain and snow. It turned out that an old woman was lying on the river bank. She was rolling her body, and her whole body and face were covered in mud. The sound was coming from her mouth. Beside her stood a ferocious and terrifying police officer. He was holding a large knife and kicking the old woman hard with the tips of his leather shoes, scolding, "Damn you, you dog, you're yelling!"</p>
<p>At this time, the police officer kicked to his satisfaction, waved his big knife at her, and walked away carrying two salt bags on his back. The old woman then cried out loud.</p>
<p>I understood what was going on and went over to comfort her. She said that her son was sick, very sick, so she picked up salt to sell to get some money for the patient, but she didn't expect it to happen again – I saw that she was really too pitiful, so I gave her eighty cents, and she stopped sobbing, propped up her broken umbrella, and went to town.</p>
<p>I stood blankly in the rain and snow for no reason until the pitiful figure disappeared.</p>
<h3>Lantern</h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>"A lantern frame, a poke and it's through," is a saying in my hometown to satirize those who are full of appearance, but are actually empty inside.</p>
<p>It is said that this lantern frame is a special product of Zhejiang Province. Just like candle wicks, it must be purchased from the place of origin and then hand-crafted before it can be sold. The styles of lanterns are: oval, rectangular, bulging, and twisted. All depend on the hands of the maker, and amateurs cannot make them.</p>
<p>Now in the new era, lanterns are completely outdated! In cities, except for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, where people use them rigidly, no one else asks about them. Only in our countryside can they be appreciated every day. When the old lunar year comes to an end, oh my! Red-letter lanterns with "×× Hall" and "×× Prefecture" are lit up, and they have many uses: completing the year-end ceremony, honoring the ancestors, sending off the stove god, welcoming the stove god, and welcoming the god of wealth, all of which are indispensable to him. In addition, on New Year's Eve, stores come out to collect debts, putting on a "lantern formation." Sometimes the sky is clear, and there is no need for lantern light, but the debt collectors insist on carrying them around, it is said that this implies "You don't have New Year's Eve, I don't have New Year's Day" meaning.</p>
<p>I still remember when I was a child, sending off the stove god on the twenty-fourth night of the twelfth month was extremely interesting! Dad: solemnly dressed in a yuan-colored satin coat, thick-soled boots, and a red-latitude hat, looking like he was acting in a play. He looked really good when he sent it off! My brother and I carried lanterns as guides. Dad: took a piece of twenty-four candy, stuck it on the stove god's mouth, and hummed, "Little kids usually disturb you and make you uneasy. This time you go to heaven, please forgive us!" The appearance is enough to elicit a laugh.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Own Merits</p>
<h3>Interests of Adults</h3>
<p>— Daqian</p>
<p>Professor Edward L. Thorndike of the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States is well-known to those who talk about education in our country. Recently, in his book "Adult Interests", he published the results of his tests on sixty-four men and women, old and young, to show the interests of adults. Mr. Sang's questions are interesting, and the answers are also interesting. The interesting ones are as follows:</p>
<p>Everyone has a sense of shame and disgust. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone is willing to offer a heavy reward to strangle a large male cat with his bare hands or chop off a pig's head at the intersection of New York's Grand Avenue and 42nd Street (note: this is the most prosperous area of New York), how much reward would you have to receive before you would be willing to do it?" (Note: This question is addressed to people in New York who have property and status). The answer for men is 25,000 yuan (US dollars hereinafter), and the answer for women is 105,000 yuan. Men and women have different physical strength and courage, so the requirements are so different. However, it is obvious that no one with property and status is willing to lose their status. The following questions, without gender restrictions, can better see the truth of interest.</p>
<p>Everyone also has a sense of compassion. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone wants you to eat four taels of cooked human flesh and gives you a reward, how much reward would you have to receive before you would be willing to do it? If a reporter is taking pictures next to you, how much reward would you have to ask for?" The answers are very different. The minimum for men is 1,000 yuan, and the minimum for women is 5,000 yuan. The average number for the men's group is 50,000 yuan. If you allow someone to advertise, you need 25 million yuan; women generally need 750,000 yuan to eat human flesh in a hidden place, but if you do it in public, it will only be slightly more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>Filthy bugs are easier to eat than human flesh. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone offers a reward for people to eat filthy bugs, such as large stink bugs or earthworms that are about six inches long, how much would you have to pay to be willing to do it? If the filthy bug is dead, how much would you have to pay to be willing to do it?" As a result, most women shook their heads and were unwilling to answer. If they think it is impossible, men would be willing to do it if they got 4,000 yuan. The dead bugs would be doubled. A few months ago, in Mississippi, USA, a woman named Motor sued a beverage company for accidentally swallowing six flies because a dirty water bottle was used to store water. The court ordered the company to compensate the woman for a loss of 500 yuan per fly. Therefore, the reward demanded by the man here is still too high.</p>
<p>The value of a mother's photo. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone offers a reward for you to spit on photos of your mother and photos of Darwin and Washington, how much would you have to pay to be willing to do it?" The answer for men is 25,000 yuan, and the answer for women is 500,000 yuan. If it is a photo of Darwin and Washington, men would be willing to do it for 30 yuan, and women would be willing to do it for 20 yuan. The price demanded by women for spitting on their mother's photos is twenty times that of men. It seems that women love their mothers more than men, but unfortunately it is still not as good as loving money!</p>
<p>Women's legs are far cheaper than men's legs. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone offers a reward for amputation of a leg or an arm, how much would you have to pay to be willing to do it?" The answer for men is tens of millions of yuan, while women only ask for one-tenth of this number, and even one-twentieth of this number if they lose an arm. American women consider legs to be a part of their beauty, and they are often shown on stage. I have never heard of anyone who wants to see men's thick and hairy legs on stage, so men never dare to show them. I thought that women's legs must be much more expensive than men's, but their self-demanded value is the opposite, and there is a big difference, which is very unexpected.</p>
<p>The dignity of the church is only worth fifteen yuan. Mr. Sang asked: "If someone asks you to make a strange noise in the church during the ceremony, how much would you have to pay to be willing to do it?" A young woman answered that she only needed 15 yuan. The price demanded by other people is also far cheaper than killing pigs in the street, which shows the Americans' belief in the church.</p>
<p>Worshiping heroes is better than loving beauty. Mr. Sang asked: "If you go to jail for talking with President Roosevelt, Stalin, Mussolini, or Garbo (a famous movie star) for half a day, how long would you have to be detained before you would be willing to do it?" As a result, most young men are willing to talk to Stalin for half a day under the condition of four days of imprisonment, talk to Mussolini for half a day, and talk to Garbo for one-seventh of a day; young women are willing to talk to Roosevelt for half a day under the condition of one day of imprisonment, talk to Stalin for half a day under the condition of two and a half days, talk to Mussolini for half a day under the condition of one and a half days, and talk to Garbo under the condition of one-third of a day; old men are willing to talk to Roosevelt for half a day under the condition of three and a half days of imprisonment, talk to Stalin for half a day under the condition of two days, and talk to Garbo for one-tenth of a day; old women are willing to talk to Roosevelt for half a day under the condition of half a day of imprisonment, talk to Stalin for half a day under the condition of nine days, talk to Mussolini for half a day under the condition of eight days, and no old women are willing to talk to Garbo in exchange for imprisonment. There is a Chinese idiom "bitterly persuade", which seems that old women should be peaceful, but now old women love heroes, which is not what I expected.</p>
<p>Almost all of the above anecdotes can be solved with money. Although the answerers may not be the ones who can do it, the psychology of the masses can be seen here. Money is omnipotent, and this can also be believed. I don't know what the answer would be if these anecdotes were moved to our country.</p>

<h3>Women's Health and Beauty</h3>
<p>The golden age of women lies in youth. The most valuable thing about youth is health and beauty. Due to physiological reasons, women age more easily than men. Also, due to environmental reasons, it is easier for them to get sick and harder to see a doctor. Why do I say this? Because women have menstruation, childbirth, and other things that are very different from men. If they suffer from leucorrhea, vaginal discharge, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, etc., they are always regarded as hidden diseases, and it is difficult to tell them. Their situation is also very pitiful.</p>
<p>Women's health and beauty can also be divided into three stages: virgin beauty, honeymoon beauty, and young woman beauty. The art of health and beauty, makeup, is its superficial aspect. Strengthening the body is its essence. This magazine is not a special magazine for beauty and makeup. Therefore, I will discuss its essence while omitting its superficial aspect.</p>
<p>The way to strengthen the body is to treat the disease if there is a disease, and restore the beauty of health and strength. If there is no disease, then keep the face and always keep the youth of that year. How to do it? Take female gonadal preparations daily to remove diseases, regulate menstruation, promote metabolism, and restore youth.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) Regulates Menstruation, Treats Leucorrhea, Soothes the Fetus, and Protects Production</h3>
<p>"Female Gonadotropin" can also remove depression, calm the liver, and develop breasts.</p>
<p>(Report by Dr. Qiao Wenbin) Last spring, Mrs. Lu Songxi came to complain of metrorrhagia, leucorrhea, and miscarriage. After I prescribed the formula, I told her to buy "Female Gonadotropin" from the Sino-French Pharmacy for internal use and "Leucorrhea Spirit" for external use. In about three weeks, she achieved satisfactory results. Her breasts were tall and fully expressed the beauty of a young woman. Her body was strong and her spirit was radiant. Her menstruation was smooth and her leucorrhea was completely gone. Last winter, she gave birth to a male child. Her milk was sufficient and the baby was strong and sturdy. Recently, I was introduced to her neighbor to treat dysmenorrhea and other diseases. I saw that her complexion was rosy and she had regained the beauty of her youth.</p>
<h3>Common Diseases of Young People Should Be Treated Quickly Before Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The bad habit of masturbation is inevitable for young people. Nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea have become common diseases. If treatment is delayed, the sperm will become thin and the brain will become weak. Hundreds of diseases will occur, health will be lost, life will be shortened, vitality will be lost, and there will be no hope for offspring. It is not appropriate to get married and have sex. Then the gonads will become more and more decadent. Premature ejaculation and kidney impotence will only fall into weakness.</p>
<p>Last fall, a patient, Yu Yongqing, came to me for treatment of his spermatorrhea and weakness because he was about to get married. After I told him to buy and take "Himidol Sperm Solidifying Tablets" and "Gonadotropin" from the Jicheng Pharmacy, the effect was significant after taking them. All the symptoms were eliminated. He regained his strength and renewed his vitality. He happily thanked me and left. It was not even a month after I counted my fingers. The wedding date was approaching, and he happily thanked me and left.</p>
<h3>(Doctor's Report) The Residual Poison Has Not Been Cleared, the Joints Are Sore</h3>
<p>(Report by Dr. Yu Bofu) Last fall, Xia Rongkun came to complain that he had suffered from venereal disease before. Although he was cured after injections and medication, the residual poison was difficult to get rid of, causing him to often feel pain in his joints. The pain was even worse every time the solar term came. His good body was like a solar term chart. After I told him to buy and take "Strongton's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Huamei Pharmacy, he immediately felt relaxed in his bones after finishing one box. He then took several boxes with peace of mind. All of his illnesses were cured and the residual poison was completely removed. His joints were comfortable. He repeatedly thanked the famous medicine for its effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Smoking Cessation Safety Primarily Emphasizes Treatment</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>There are many methods for quitting smoking, such as using sleeping pills, blistering agents, antitoxins, substitutes, serums, denaturants, and bloodletting. However, methods that focus on tonifying and nourishing are the safest. The tonifying agents vary, but the key is to treat illnesses when present and strengthen the body when healthy. Gonadal preparations possess all of the aforementioned benefits, making them the supreme and safest remedy for quitting smoking, truly a blessing for both men and women addicted to smoking.</p>
<h3>(Published as Received) Safe Smoking Cessation for Stomach Pain and Menstrual Pain</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mrs. Yin Peiyuan): I am naturally weak and prone to illness. I first suffered from menstrual pain and then stomach pain, which were unbearable. This led me to become addicted to smoking. I repeatedly resolved to quit, but the pain always interfered, making it impossible to succeed completely. Last autumn, due to the pressure of the ban, I could no longer delay. I sent a letter to this publication seeking a treatment method. The editor responded by recommending that I purchase and take "Female Gonadal Extract," "Stomach Pain Remedy," and "Stomach Strengthening Pills" from Taihe Pharmacy, three famous medicines. After taking them as directed, my stomach pain was completely cured, and I no longer had abdominal pain during menstruation. Moreover, my spirit was revitalized, my body strengthened, and the toxins from smoking were eliminated. I developed an aversion to cigarettes. In about four weeks, I successfully quit smoking safely.</p>
<h3>Impotence and Premature Ejaculation Make it Difficult to Fulfill Marital Duties</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Masturbation and excessive sexual activity take a toll on the gonads. Repeated damage leads to atrophy, causing impotence, premature ejaculation, and venereal diseases. The consequences are not only physical weakness but also the loss of vitality and the inability to fulfill marital duties. Kidney deficiency and thin semen make it impossible to have children. The most effective treatment is to take gonadal preparations internally. For rapid recovery, one can also seek electrotherapy from a renowned venereal disease specialist, which will revive vitality, restore marital function, and make it possible to have offspring.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Jiang Juchuan wrote a letter stating that he had previously been ignorant of proper care and suffered from impotence and premature ejaculation due to excessive indulgence. He sought treatment in various ways without complete success. After being married for many years, he found it difficult to fulfill his marital duties, let alone have children. Later, he consulted Dr. Zhan Nianceng, a venereal disease specialist, who administered electrotherapy and instructed him to purchase and take "Gonadal Extract" from Taihe Pharmacy. His vitality was immediately restored, his health improved, and his venereal disease disappeared. He was able to resume his marital duties. Now, his wife has been pregnant for many months, demonstrating the regenerative power of famous doctors and famous medicines, no less than the Bodhisattva Guanyin delivering children.</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea - Uterine Inflammation</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is generally caused by inflammation. Based on the location of the inflammation, it can be divided into uterine body leukorrhea, vestibular leukorrhea, cervical leukorrhea, and vaginal leukorrhea. Leukorrhea caused by uterine inflammation is the most common.</p>
<p>The treatment should emphasize both internal and external approaches. Internally, take female gonadal preparations to strengthen the uterus and reduce inflammation. Externally, use a combination product of lactic acid bacteria, vaginal bacilli, and liver starch. This combined approach, regardless of the location of the inflammation, can completely eliminate leukorrhea.</p>
<p>For example, Mrs. Wang Xingyue suffered from chronic leukorrhea and menstrual irregularities, which led to infertility after many years of marriage. Her parents-in-law, husband, and others blamed her. Last year, she sent a letter to this publication seeking treatment. Following the advice, she purchased "Female Gonadal Extract" from a Chinese and Western pharmacy for internal use and "Leukorrhea Remedy" for external use. Later, she sent a thank-you letter stating that she had undergone secret self-treatment and recovered within a month. Not only were her menstruation and leukorrhea regulated, but she also achieved a level of health and beauty she had never experienced before.</p>
<p>(Note) "Leukorrhea Remedy" uses lactic acid bacteria, vaginal bacilli, and liver starch as its main ingredients, making it highly effective for external use in treating leukorrhea. Usage: Insert one or two tablets into the vagina every other night. It is extremely simple.</p>

<p>(1) Safe Addiction Breaking for Stomach Pain and Smoking</p>
<p>Venereal disease cured, spirit happy!</p>
<p>Patient: Liu Yongxiao, local, 38 years old, businessman. (Chief Complaint): Premature ejaculation, stomach pain, stopped smoking. (Medical History): Mr. Liu was poisoned by obscene books at a young age and developed the bad habit of masturbation. Relying on his strength, he did not repent, resulting in damage to his sexual function. After marriage, he suffered from severe premature ejaculation and also suffered from stomach pain due to improper diet. He became addicted to smoking six years ago, making it impossible to treat the disease or quit the addiction. Last autumn, he attempted to quit smoking but experienced pain, forcing him to give up halfway. He was then referred to me by a colleague for treatment. (Treatment): In addition to using the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy, I also prescribed "Gonadal Extract," "Stomach Pain Remedy," and "Stomach Strengthening Pills," three famous medicines, from Zhengwei Pharmacy. His stomach problem was completely cured. Because "Gonadal Extract" has the effect of treating premature ejaculation and breaking smoking addiction, it was completely effective.</p>
<p>(2) Rapid Cure of Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>A lesson for those who ruin themselves through masturbation!</p>
<p>Patient: Yao Fuquan, Anhui, 22 years old, worker. (Chief Complaint): Spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, thin semen, weak brain. (Medical History): Mr. Yao was tempted by bad friends and developed a severe habit of masturbation, which atrophied his gonads, leading to spermatorrhea. Furthermore, he had many extramarital affairs, which led to premature ejaculation. Last autumn, he sought treatment before his wedding because of thin semen and a weak brain. (Treatment): In addition to administering electrotherapy and advising him on health maintenance, I also prescribed medication based on his symptoms. I instructed him to purchase "Gonadal Extract" and "Himitol Sperm Strengthening Pills" from the Western Medicine Department of Xinxin Company. Once his sperm gate was secured, the problem was naturally alleviated. His semen was sufficient, his brain healthy, and his body recovered strongly. His qi and blood were abundant, and his spirit was revitalized. Even when work was busy, he did not feel tired at all. As his wedding date approached at the beginning of winter, he happily thanked me and left.</p>

<p>Illness shackles removed at once!</p>
<p>Patient: Mrs. Sha Xuelian. (Chief Complaint): Kidney deficiency, lower back pain, rheumatic bone pain. (Symptoms): Mrs. Sha had insufficient endowment and a weak body. She often suffered from irregular menstruation, sometimes too much, sometimes too little, sometimes early, sometimes late. She also suffered from lower back pain and bone pain, which were neglected for a long time. In recent years, she also developed uterine inflammation. Last autumn, I diagnosed her with leukorrhea, which she secretly kept hidden, causing her great pain. (Presenting symptoms): Leukorrhea, numbness in hands and feet. (Treatment): I prescribed "John Stein's Bone Pain Pills" to treat her bone pain and numbness and "Female Gonadal Extract" internally and "Leukorrhea Remedy" externally to regulate menstruation and treat leukorrhea, treating her uterine inflammation and restoring the lightness and health of her kidneys and lower back. Mrs. Sha purchased the medications from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and used them internally and externally as directed for about a month, achieving the aforementioned satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Many Years of Infertility Re-ignite Vitality</p>
<p>Famous Medicine Brings a Child, Joy Fills the Home!</p>
<p>Patient: Fan Dongsui, Hubei, 30 years old, businessman. (Chief Complaint): Impotence, infertility after many years of marriage. (Medical History): Mr. Fan suffered from severe neurasthenia due to overwork. In addition, unregulated sexual activity caused atrophy of the gonads, leading to impotence, making it difficult to fulfill his marital duties and feeling a lack of zest for life. He came for consultation last spring through a friend's referral. (Presenting symptoms): Neurasthenia. (Treatment): In addition to administering electrotherapy, I determined that Mr. Fan's illness originated in the gonads and could not be treated with ordinary tonifying preparations. Therefore, I prescribed "Gonadal Extract" and instructed him to purchase it from China-England Pharmacy. After taking it, his vitality was re-ignited, and his impotence suddenly disappeared. The symptoms of neurasthenia gradually disappeared. Last winter, I was introduced to his partner, Mr. Ma, who came to treat premature ejaculation. He told me that they had already had a child.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Such Civilization</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, Italian planes dropped leaflets in unoccupied areas of Algeria, enticing Algerians to submit, saying, "We have come here to bestow civilization upon you, so that you may enjoy wealth and prosperity." These are beautiful words! An Italian officer once claimed to people, "Italy has the responsibility of maintaining world civilization. The purpose of the Italian army's current war against Algeria is to fulfill this mission." An Italian writer also said, "For fifty years, Italy has exhausted its efforts to bring Algeria into the realm of civilization, but it has been rejected by that country. Now Italy has decided to send troops to East Africa, and the intention is none other than this, for which there is a justified reason." It seems that Italy's conquest of Algeria is not an invasion, but a war for "civilization"!</p>
<p>Italy is a "civilized country," and not only is Italy proud of this, but the whole world also recognizes it. Algeria? Undoubtedly a "barbaric country," at least in the eyes of Italians. Therefore, in order for Italy to "fulfill the mission of maintaining world civilization," to "bring Algeria into the realm of civilization," and to "bestow civilization upon the Algerian people," it had no choice but to dispatch a large army from Europe to Africa. If Algeria could fully understand Italy's goodwill and welcome them with food and drink, humbly accepting the civilization bestowed by Italy, it would not have suffered this massacre. Unfortunately, the Algerians were unwilling to "enjoy wealth and prosperity," their barbaric nature did not change, and they dared to resist. Therefore, Italy had no choice but to use force to spread its civilization. As a result, the gift of civilization that the Algerians received from Italy was the bombing of airplanes and the impact of tanks! Just as the surrender leaflets said, "If you can welcome us with open arms and regard us as good friends, we will not commit the slightest offense against your homes, churches, and possessions. Otherwise, when the army arrives, everything will be destroyed."</p>
<p>This is the civilization that Italy has demonstrated! Recently, the Italian army has achieved great victories, capturing cities and seizing land, and advancing on the Algerian capital. The League of Nations, which is known as an international "peace organization," is also implementing reconciliation strategies under the delay of the oil embargo. It is reported that both Italy and Algeria have expressed their willingness to accept reconciliation. The four-month war may come to an end. In the future, defeated Algeria will inevitably have to cede territory in exchange for peace. Let us see how Italy will promote its civilization after its ambitions are satisfied!</p>
<p>However, aggressor countries always have many excuses. For example, the "friendly nation" that is oppressing our country, its barbaric behavior is no less than that of Italy in dealing with Algeria. But Italy not only does not admit to being barbaric, but also says that it is spreading civilization. What does the "friendly nation" say? A "friendly nation's" military officer recently made a statement to foreign reporters, claiming that "we are here to stand on a cultural footing and seek peace in East Asia." It turns out that the "friendly nation" has been mobilizing large armies for several years, trampling on our land, and is actually doing this for "peace"! No wonder the sound of "friendship and cooperation" has been incessant!</p>
<p>But can this cover up their ugliness?</p>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Xu Renjie</p>
<p>Under the lamp, the husband finished reading Chang Tian's newspaper. When he came out from the back room after changing into his sleeping clothes, he said to his young wife:</p>
<p>"My memory is really bad lately. Didn't I tell you? I saw a more suitable house yesterday."</p>
<p>The young wife was half-lying in bed, with the bedside lamp on, reading a romance novel contentedly. The protagonists in the novel were a young couple who were happily spending their days after getting married. One day, when they came out of a cafe, they happened to buy an airline ticket, which won the second prize. When the husband came back from the bank after collecting the prize money, as they embraced and kissed each other, the wife noticed a diamond-shaped red mark on her husband's suit pocket.</p>
<p>When the young wife read to this point, she unconsciously raised her head and looked at her husband in the sofa chair, but the husband had slowly approached the bed and continued:</p>
<p>"You are the housewife, you should go and see it yourself tomorrow."</p>
<p>Although the husband had already changed into his sleeping clothes, the wife's gaze was still focused on his small pocket. She seemed not to have heard what her husband said.</p>
<p>However, the husband misunderstood his wife's meaning, lowered his head and affectionately kissed his wife's forehead, and said: "Do you think I'm deceiving you again?"</p>
<p>The wife immediately cleverly continued:</p>
<p>"Did you go to see the house today?"</p>
<p>The husband pretended to be angry and snatched the novel from her hand. "I'll order you a magazine every year. These kinds of novels are all about love and flesh, aren't they?…I said I've seen a house, at the intersection of Albert Road and something, a small Western-style house, the rent is quite cheap, forty taels. Do you want to go and see it tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Because the wife was not used to living in a one-story house, she often twisted her husband and acted coquettishly, she wanted to live in a small Western-style house with a small garden. In the morning, breakfast in the flower garden, and in the evening, a walk in the garden, is the most hygienic. She cited her classmates as examples, whoever lives on Huanlong Road, whoever lives on Lafayette Road, are all small Western-style houses with gardens. Her biggest intention was that living in a one-story house was too shabby.</p>
<p>However, the school where the husband taught was often in arrears with wages, and when he couldn't pay the rent, he always slammed his briefcase and wanted to change careers. Therefore, although he understood his wife's meaning, he only gently perfunctorily comforted his wife, he had so many books, moving always made a mess, and besides, moving was so troublesome, didn't it take more than half a month to get here?</p>
<p>Recently, the husband got his hands on some public funds, and he told his wife that they were going to move. But he was also busy with social engagements and often didn't come home until midnight. The day before yesterday evening, this young couple quarreled: the wife said he shouldn't deceive her, she wanted to go back to her mother's house. The husband panicked and went to see a small Western-style house the next day, but when he came home, the wife was already asleep. Today, he was busy with two banquets, and he didn't think of it until this time.</p>
<p>"Albert Road, what intersection?" the wife smiled "You must be deceiving me again!" The husband held his wife's hand even more gently, "I really forgot that road name. - My memory is too bad. But there is only such a small red-tiled Western-style house on Albert Road, I remember it very clearly." He hesitated for a moment, but I don't have time tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Lies</h3>
<p>According to the Chinese branch of the International Labour Office, the number of unemployed people in our country recently reached more than 5.8 million. Tan Lao San said that this is only based on those who have been employed and then lost their jobs again. If those who have never been employed and hope to be employed are included, it is probably more than twice this number. Therefore, making those who are unemployed employed and making those who have lost their jobs re-employed is the country's top priority.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Hitler recently issued an order to the whole country that on the memorial day for soldiers killed in the European War, new national flags should be hung uniformly. The new flag is black, white, and red. Tan Lao San said that the other day a German youth wore a red bow tie, and the local authorities immediately regarded it as a sign of communist thought and sentenced him to six months in prison. Now the national flag also has red, so what can be said?</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>, otherwise I'll go with you."</p>
<p>The wife gently hit her husband's shoulder and said, "Who wants you to go with me? - Give me back that book, I want to finish reading it and go to sleep."</p>
<p>The next day the husband came home again at midnight. While taking off his coat, he asked his wife, "Isn't that Western-style house very good?"</p>
<p>The wife suddenly pouted: "Doesn't the landlord also live inside? I don't want it!"</p>
<p>"What does that matter? It's separated by a garden. And the landlord is a widow."</p>
<p>The wife jumped out of bed, grabbed her husband's shoulders and shook him repeatedly: "I'm asking you, what exactly have you been doing lately, coming back in the middle of the night every day?"</p>
<p>The husband stared blankly at his wife's face.</p>
<p>"You're throwing a temper for no reason again. I'll go with you to find it again tomorrow."</p>
<p>The wife leaned into the light and sharply checked her husband's pockets, but there was nothing, while the husband gently hugged her and apologized.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want"! The wife laughed in her husband's arms.</p>
<h3>Nora (8)</h3>
<p>— Wan Chao Chen (Artist) Xin Xin (Text)</p>
<p>Nora: The first year after our marriage, he worked himself too hard. He had to look for various extra things to do and worked tirelessly all day long. Later he couldn’t stand it and became very ill. The doctors all said that he had to go south to get better. We lived in Italy for a year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: I know about that. Your father supplied the expenses for your trip.</p>
<p>Nora: (Smiling) That’s right, Torvald and others all thought it was like that, but, but my father never gave us a single penny. It wasn’t anyone else who planned that sum of money, it was me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: You? Such a large sum of money was all? Nora, I really don’t understand!</p>
<p>Nora: You must know that I spent quite a bit of effort. Paying the installments on time is not a good game. So I had to piece together a little bit everywhere. Sometimes Torvald gave me money and told me to buy clothes, but I never spent more than half of the money! Last winter I was lucky enough to copy things for people and stayed up late. Sometimes, I was too tired, but doing this work and earning money was really happy. I felt like I was a man.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: So, how much of your debt have you paid off?</p>
<p>Nora: It’s hard to say. I only know that all the money I could scrape together has been used to pay off the debt. But it doesn’t matter now, my hardships have passed.</p>

<h3>Early Winter in Qingyang Port (14)</h3>
<p>— Qiuyuan</p>
<p>The sun was already a little westward. They walked out of the Railway Hotel, walking on the path on the open field, passing by three or five rural houses, stepping over several single-log bridges, walking, walking onto the Xihu Highway, crossing the bridge over Qingyang Port; the autumn wind blew in gusts, blowing Qiuhua's brownish-yellow hair, although it was not the spring breeze, in this little spring weather in October, this early winter spring, it was enough to intoxicate people. By the time they crossed Qingyang Port and followed the path to Qingyang Port Station, it was already dusk. The car hadn't arrived yet. They sat on the railing on the bridge, talking, not knowing what kind of world this was, except for the two of them.</p>
<p>——Really, Forever yours?</p>
<p>——Of course, for the day I have life, this life is all for you. Dians, tell me, do you love me forever.</p>
<p>——If not, if there is no love, you know!</p>
<p>——Then you know, in such a big world, where are we?</p>
<p>Zhuomin hugged Qiuhua and kissed her deeply, again and again. He rushed to the train station to buy tickets, and the train was about to leave. He got on the train, put his right hand around Qiuhua's waist, kissed her again and again. The train started moving and Qiuhua also closed her eyes. They got off the car at the North Station, walked slowly out of the station:</p>
<p>——We seem to have come back from a honeymoon trip.</p>
<p>——Isn’t it?</p>
<p>——When can we go again. (The End)</p>

<p>Huamei (1060) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Free Marriage"</p>
<p>Social liberation learns civilization. Matchmakers are no longer needed to arrange marriages. People misunderstand freedom and learn frivolity. Classmates of the opposite sex entrust each other with their lives. Some already have wives at home. Yet, they abandon the old and love the new, making new alliances. Some, slightly pursuing love in the field of romance, engage in triangular affairs. In the end, they each ruin their future. Some, upon first meeting, drool with desire. They kneel and propose marriage with fake tears. Some, the concubine and the lover secretly exchange rings. When discussing their backgrounds, they are like duckweeds. Some hide it from their fathers, brothers, and all ten siblings. In their old age, they mistakenly use their feelings to covet flowers. Some, a roaring lion overturns the marriage contract. They demand alimony and accuse bigamy. In short, the two words "freedom" mislead their lives. It exhausts the Old Man Under the Moon, who mistakenly recognizes people. You should know that, since ancient times, amorousness has only left regrets. Good dreams are always the easiest to wake up from. Do not waste your good youth.</p>
<p>Cai Xiaofang's Record of Retribution</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Song Jiang"</p>
<p>The Liangshan bandit Song Gongming. Assembles a crowd of fleeing people. They even seize warehouses, kill officials and soldiers. Rob homes and plunder villages. Moreover, those thirty-six ruffians. Dare to be tyrannical in Shandong and Hebei. "Acting on behalf of Heaven" is deceptive language. For the moment accept amnesty to stabilize the hearts of the people. Unfortunately, the government troops are unsuccessful in capturing the bandits. Because the crowd scatters and is difficult to find. In those days, Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong were both immoral. They employed that bunch of Tong Guan, Gao Qiu, and Cai Jing. The entire court is filled with treacherous ministers. People's hearts are difficult to appease everywhere. Various heroes rise up and bandits wield weapons. Although their jumping and clowning are petty. Smoke from the beacons rises everywhere, lacking mediation. The people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, lacking provisions. The bandits are a bit insincere. Fortunately, the commander meets Zhang Shuye. Originally, he possessed deep wisdom and strategy of the Six Secret Teachings and the Three Strategies. He was able to completely pacify the area overnight. Later, the entire story was written into the Water Margin. Enduring Ann Shi's ingenious talent. Creating something from nothing, making the empty into reality. Depicting the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends. The far-fetched imagination is truly lovely. Making up exactly one hundred and eight people. Wonderfully, the bandits eventually belong to Duan Jingzhu. And there is also the Timely Rain Song Jiang. The implied meaning is extremely profound. Bounties were offered for tens of thousands of strings of cash. Therefore, playing cards were used to gamble and win. But I do not know, who shot the longbow and short arrow. A form that is questionably real resembling the character Zhang. The ending of Liangshan is a dream that awakens.</p>
<p>Xing Ruiting's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Huadong (1360) 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Zhang Chang Paints Eyebrows"</p>
<p>The affairs of the elegant 京兆 are many. Spent all day in the room. He discusses and draws the eyebrow styles in the morning makeup. Spending effort to grind ten buckets of screws. Colors of poetry on both 管. Encourage the beauty 共吟哦. Excess ink to fill the sheep's hair. The desire to paint the new moon. Deep and shallow between the styles. More flipping of the eyebrows. There are new styles of the moon. There are light brows. There are willow leaves. There are new touches on the eyebrow. Put that mirror of colors. Fine eyebrows. Under the window. Unexpectedly, the beautiful 屑流传伉俪和. Thousands of years of beautiful Chinese home. Beauty records the makeup to the night song.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>A certain newspaper reported: "In "Spring ××," there was originally a humorous dialogue: 'Look at this large company, would it owe you money!'" It is now heard that it has also been cut by Zhang Laoda Ishikawa's order. After reading it, one cannot help but sigh at the scissors, scissors.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: This piece of news, is it "transmitted" by the propaganda department?)</p>
<p>The propaganda draft was checked by the director's department, and it is said to be "a new initiative that deeply understands the ways of the world," so "other film companies that eat propaganda rice, seem to be able to imitate."</p>
<p>Let me add another sentence, if it works well, "film companies that eat propaganda rice" should not forget the inventor, Mr. Wu "Early Tea," at least, after thousands of years, they should also cast a bronze statue to commemorate him.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Xu Lai wanting two thousand dollars to film "Gold ××" doesn't seem to be a formal propaganda draft.)</p>
<p>After the implementation of the method of having the director's department review the Star's empty drafts, some staff members have refused to write propaganda drafts.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: But the semi-monthly cover can still be freely distributed.)</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. "Early Tea" had some inappropriate remarks when he took office, "I am a good gentleman to speak with," so he has the intention of denying it. In my opinion, it is indeed "necessary to issue a 'written statement'," because that is how it appears official.</p>
<p>Old Teng, we understand each other without saying it.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Because Yangzi's words are still fresh in our ears??)</p>
<h3>The First Flag of Europa</h3>
<p>In these difficult and heavy times, dramatists should also stand up and do some work. The anti-imperialist play "The First Flag of Europa," which was promoted some time ago, according to today's news, the Shanghai Drama Film Research Institute has decided to start rehearsals recently. The second session of new students at the institute will start on the 15th of this month. It is heard that preparations for everything related to this play are being intensified these days. Work will begin immediately after the 15th. It is heard that the performance time is around the middle of next month. The staff and actors will be announced in these days.</p>

<h3>Lianhua Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Wu Yonggang, is one of the most outstanding talents in today's silver screen director team, recently his work "Waves Washing Sand" has been completed eighty percent. Among all the sound films with dialogue produced by Lianhua, this film will be the first to meet the people of the country. This film is not only Lianhua's first major sound production, but also Wu Yonggang and Jin Yan's first collaboration, which is said to be a great success.</p>
<p>"The Lost Lamb," is quite anticipated by movie lovers, the entire film is about to be completed, and can be shown after "Waves Washing Sand."</p>
<p>Bao Mu is preparing to make greater efforts this year. This year, he will direct two major new films with all his strength. One that has been decided is "Childhood China," another new film script has been selected, and as soon as preparations are completed, filming will begin.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's new work after "Waves Washing Sand," is said to be set in a school, writing about college student stories.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong abandoned "Wild Cat" and is still filming Three Soldiers, and is currently dividing the scenes.</p>
<p>The props needed in "Go to Nature" are mostly extraordinary items, and the costumes for the male and female actors are even more fashionable and made of precious materials. It is estimated that the cost of the male and female costumes used in the film has broken Lianhua's highest record.</p>
<p>Li Lili, Xu Jian, Gong Zhihua, play three sisters full of Guizhou spirit in "Go to Nature." The lives of these three young ladies can be said to be extremely extravagant. The various high-heeled shoes worn by these three young ladies alone, if displayed in a room, would be like a ladies' shoe store.</p>
<p>In "Waves Washing Sand," Wen Rong plays a wine-loving sailor, singing "Prostitute's Complaint" when drunk. According to this tune is very popular in Tianjin, North.</p>
<p>Huang Duzhen, who plays a female professor in "Song of the Loving Mother," has been working hard to learn Mandarin recently, and Chen Yanyan is her voluntary teacher.</p>
<p>Lianhua's recent fist-sized parrot, recently appeared in "To Nature." This parrot can also learn human language, such as "Ready, Camera" can be said. After Meng Junmou's patient teaching, it can already call "Han Langen" by name. When Han heard it the other day, Han pointed to the parrot and smiled, "Listening to it call me with its little mouth, there is an indescribable sense of beauty, it's just a pity it can't smile at me. ——"</p>
