<h3 id="c46">法國人民政權的曙光 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>最近歐洲政局的各方面發展。沒有一件不是値得我們深切注意的。意德會議與西班牙不干涉協定名存實亡所引起的重大影響。當然是不用說了。就是法國人民政府的轉危為安。也於歐洲和平有極大的關係。而給予我們以一個很寳貴的敎訓。</p>
<p>法國人民陣綫自從去年二月六日法西斯黨暴動後組織以來。在今年五月的議會選舉中就獲得空前的勝利而組成人民政府。法國人民政府的出現。不但是共和制度的有力保衛。而且對於歐洲以至於國際和平。也是一層重要的保障。不過人民政府執政後不到半年。由於內部發生很大的裂痕。幾致全部動搖。人民陣綫的內部為什麽會發生裂痕呢。要回答這個問題。我們就得先明瞭人民陣綫組成的份子與目的。法國人民陣綫的構成分子。是左翼的三个個政黨。卽急進社會黨。正統派社會黨與共產黨。他們的政綱是各不相同的。其所以能够組成共同陣綫。是因為那時法西斯派的勢力很大。二月六日的大暴動。幾使無數人民流血得來的共和制度全部推翻。於是左翼各黨就聯合組成人民陣綫。集中力量。以保衛共和制度。反抗法西斯政權。所以勃倫總理說得好。「法西斯團體實為人民陣綫的父母。」</p>
<p>人民陣綫因為集中團結的力量。在今年五月選舉勝利後。就得組成人民政府。不過他們雖有共同的政治綱領。但因為各黨所代表的利益究竟不同。所以總免不了發生若干的裂痕。尤其是選舉勝利後各地被壓迫工人的羣起罷工。佔領廠屋激起了代表中產階級利益之急進社會黨的不滿。當時因為人民政府　握政權。反動派的勢力仍非常高漲。因此內部糾紛未立時爆發出來但到了最近因為人民政府施政的得當法西斯派勢力已稍减低。於是這裂痕就逐漸擴大起來急進社會黨的右翼份子堅决要排擠共產黨於人民陣綫之外。在比亞利茲城急進社會黨大會的前夕。形勢顯得非常的危急。但後來終因各黨的顧全大局。尤其是共產黨的讓步。（如表示保守秩序與尊重私人財產）急進社會黨仍决議參加人民陣线。於是人民政府的甚礎才又轉危為安。</p>
<p>法國人民政府某礎的鞏固。不但使國內反動派的勢力無從抬頭。共和制度得以確保。而且在國際方面。也增加了集體安全制度的力量。而給予侵略陣綫以一個很大的打擊。因為法國人民政府是採取和平的外交政策的。</p>

<p>靑海地處邊遠、交通阻塞、在滬求學者幾無一人、中國敎育學會上海分會邊疆敎育委員會陳鶴岑·劉湛恩·舒新城·何淸需諸氏、有　及此、與新靑海社設法爲靑海靑年謀實地求學、以備邊疆寶用、新靑海社特派　社編輯部主任張得善、來滬與陳劉舒諸氏接洽結果、招收靑海學生十一名、補助膳宿、　滬求學、並與靑海省敎育會新靑海社共同負担招生事宜、所招學生共十一名、已於本月二十六日早八時到京、二十七日十二時二十五分搭車來滬、由新靑海社編輯部主任張得善率領、當日下午九時抵此、上海社記者特趨訪張君、探詢經過情形如下、</p>
<p>招生經過</p>
<p>此次招生爲愼重起見、經靑海省敎育會楊希堯顧懷豐等、與新靑海社鄧欽義馬尊偉等、於八月二十日商定招生辦法、當卽登報招生、中間經過筆試、體格檢騐、於八月二十八日竣事、錄取學生十二名、</p>

<h3 id="c94">全國教育槪况（一） <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>（尃科以上學校就業訓導班講演）</p>
<p>各位、今天要向各位講講我國現在敎育概况、分成四個部分來講、(一）全國初等敎育狀况、（二）全國中等敎育狀况、（三）全國高等敎育狀况、（四）全國社會敎育狀况、</p>
<p>（一）全國初等敎育狀况初等敎育是敎育系統中最低級的敎育、初等機關、大致可分爲「幼稚園」和「小學」兩種、</p>
<p>幼稚園是招收年齡尚未達到入小學的兒童、卽四歲至六歲的兒童而施以敎育的、設立幼稚園的最重要目的、是就幼兒喜動和愛羣的天性敎以種種遊戲活動、去强壯他的身體、練習他的感官、並增長他的觀察和組織的能力、這是一般幼兒共同的需要、特別是從事職業無暇照顧子女的母親或是缺少保育幼兒知議和經騐的家庭、如能把幼兒送到幼稚園去、更爲妥善、我國幼稚園數量甚少、據敎育部二十二年度統計、全國幼稚園共一千零九十七校、幼兒僅四萬七千五百十二人、雖則各年度均有進步、但距離實際需要相差當然很遠、在這四萬多幼兒中、男孩約佔百分之五七·七、女孩約佔百分之四三·三、男女白分比很相近、我國男女敎育機會均等、祇有幼稚園內尚可勉强談到、其餘一般中小學及大學均比不上、在幼稚敎育方面、這是一件差堪自慰的事情、</p>
<p>現在講到小學、小學爲施行國民義務敎育的塲所、修業年限六年、前四年爲初級小學、後二年爲高級小學初級小學得單獨設立、在敎育未普及以前、初級小學爲國民最低限度應受之義務敎育、凡六足歲之兒童、均須入初級小學、遇有特殊情形者、得展至九足歲按照規定、小學以不收學費爲原則、遇有地方不得已情形時、亦得酌量徵收、在公立小學每人每學期、初級者至多不得過一元、高級者至多不得過二元、在私立小學每人每學期初級者至多不得過三元、高級者至多不得過六元、而在微收學費之小學應設有三分之一、以上的貧苦兒童免費學額、遇有無力繳納學費者、小學校長應酌量情形免除其學費之一部或全部、</p>
<p>義務敎育年限各國不同、如日本六年、美國七年以上、德國法國及比國八年、英國九年以上、而我國僅爲四年，就是這短短的四年、還有許多兒童、因爲貧苦的原故不能入校、雖已入學、而仍不能讀完、因此之故敎育部爲推行義務敎育普及起見、一方面督促地方廣設上述的高級小學及初級小學、一方面規定地方得設簡易小學及短期小學以資救濟、各省市應斟酌地方情形辦理各種小學、人民自由選擇一種相當的小學、而使其子弟入學、以求全國民都能受最低限度的義務敎育、據地二十二年度敎育部的統計、全國共有小學二十五萬七千九百九十八校內初級小學二十萬八千　　零九校、高初合設小學二萬二千三百十九校、簡易小學四千零四十四校、短期小學二千六百零三校，其他六百二十三校、小學生共計一千二百三十三萬五千九百六十七人、內初小生一千一百零八萬三千二百五十三人、高小一百零六萬六千九百五十五人、簡小生八萬二千一百八十人、短小生八萬四千五百十一人、其他生一萬九千零六十八人、每千人口中有小學生約二十七人、受義務敎育的兒實佔學齡兒童的爲百分之二十五弱、較諸敎育已普及的先進各國固然相差很多、卽較之現代新興國家如波蘭·土耳其。蘇俄等國也是比不上的、因爲牠們的入學兒童大都已經達到學齡兒童百分之九十以上了、</p>
<p>二十四年教育部遵照第四屆中央執行委員會第五次全體會議實施義務敎育治標治本兼顧的方案、製定一個義務敎育的十年計劃、卽實施義務敎育暫行辦法大綱、於去年公布、其施行程序分爲三期、</p>
<p>第一期自民國二十四年八月起、至二十九年七月止、餘擴充原有小學外、廣設一年制短期小學、在本期最後一年卽二十九年務使全國學齡兒童、至少受一年短期小學敎育者、達到百分之八十以上、第二期自民國二十九年八月起、至三十三年七月止、在此期內、將一年制短期小學、逐漸改爲二年制短期小學、在本期最後一年卽三十三年務使全國學齡兒童、至少受二年短期小學敎育者、達到百分之八十以上、</p>
<p>第三期自三十三年八月起、應將二年短期小學逐漸改爲四年的初級小學、務使全國舉齡兒童至少都受釗四年的義務敎育、</p>
<p>現行的一年制短期小學、招收年滿九歲至十二歲的兒童、援以國語算術公民及體育、不收學費、學生課業用品、亦由學校免費供給、凡應入學而不入學者、先勸告其父兄、令其入學、如屢受勸告而仍不令其孑弟入學者、處以一元至五元的罰金、仍責令其子弟入學、</p>
<p>不過要實施這種義務敎育的十年計劃、首先須要　備經費、過去義務教育進行的遲緩、困於經費、實爲重大原因之一、此次擬具十年計劃時、對於　劃經費一節、除令各省市目行籌措外復由中央撥欵補助、二十四年度中央補助各省市三百二十萬元、一十五年度增至四百七十五萬元、以後更擬逐年增加、同時督促各省市亦逐漸籌增、希望義務敎育之推行、不以經費困難而遲緩、</p>
<p>經費旣定、敎育部一方面、（一）成立敎育部全國義務敎育委員會、襄理全國義務敎育、（二）審核各省市義務敎育經費之收支、（三）指派督學專員分赴各省市視察督促並輔導、他方面、（一）通令各省市擬具實施義務敎育計劃並確定之、（二）通令各省市組織省縣市義務敎育委員會以襄助各省縣市主管敎育行政機關辦理義務敎育、（三）通令各省市劃分小學區、的以千左右劃分一小學區、積極從事短期小學之設立、近年來全國計增短期小學的四萬八千校、短期小學班一萬六千級、學生四百餘萬、本年度敎育部爲推動各省市辦理義敎工作起見、特在京舉辦義敎幹部人員　費班、由各省市保送辦理　　人員來京受訓、此項訓　現已開始、將來各學員回省以後、須負訓練各縣市義敎人員之責、務使從事義敎工作人員對於一切法令幾章，及進行方法能明白認職、切實進行、（未完）</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份又呈疲滯之象、洋麥報價、雖續好一角三四角不等、惟以大連物價趨疲、小麥人心、亦爲之帶軟、更以市値太高、大多頭亦逐漸减少、澳麥謠傳、又有八元五角還價之電訊、致人心步鬆、較前日又跌五六分、迨至下午開盤、初仍續小三四分、二盤以後、因人心漸定、浮空抵補、回漲五六分、結果祗近小六分、遠期小一三分、現麥市面、仍然平穩、惟標準連小兩日、現麥不動、故廠方進胃已懈、當須擯小幾分、山東麥開六元零五分、洋河麥六元零五分、决六元、崇明麥五元八角二分、决七角、黃喬麥五元八角十分、蕪湖麥五元九角三分、由申大辦四千包云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到近四十號、貨共八千餘石、客帮包胃續見暢旺、有靑烟平津等帮辦新薄稻近三千包及厚新粳七八百包、惟本街方面仍屬平常、致市况尚難振作、結果厚新粳平定、菉種百哥等高料較能站住外、中段貨猶貶近角、杜尖則店胃殊健、續升角許、洋尖因亦帶高一角、厚薄破粳無一定之標準、新陰則以到旺銷滯、再跌三四角之巨、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十一二號市上去化平常、破粳新粳形勢平疲、菉種窰柿包胃暢銷、市價挺緊、客尖定立、陰變元價小角外、其餘各米價亦見疲勢、</p>

<p>價漲一角半</p>
<p>昨日客秈新到一萬多包、而去路更活、市面乃呈步砌之局、昨客化南北均活、允以河南帮與粤汕爲佳、河南帮前曾一度辦裝、昨日去胃較貪、允以河南之歸德一帶需要爲殷、汕粤與本街亦均暢辦機米、因此機米續漲一角至一角半不等、糙米粵胃稍淡、行情祇續漲三五分而已、全日開出贛米六千包、湘米七千包、台州米一百八十包、沙市米五百包、廠粞一百包、</p>

<p>日本在海外搜辦不絕　期貨須五六月後可定</p>
<p>黑鐵頭子（卽黑頭皮之頭子）爲油漆筒鐵類等之必需品、惟前因存貨湧旺、到源不絕、市塲趨勢萎靡不振、標準開價亦十分軟弱、每市出行惰　沽五元四五角、最近數日、海外來電、多謂此項貨色、被日本購辦、來華之貨、須等五六個月後、方有期貨可定、致本埠需用此貨之廠家、大起恐慌、　出收羅、但市貨月經搜辦之後、卽告缺乏、行情因之在跳不已、每市担價竟漲六元四角、　尚無大批現貨可購、而漢津川贛諸能昨日對於此貨、亦多問津、預料市象前途、一時尚不易轉鬆云、</p>

<p>玉山珍眉復轉活動</p>
<p>昨據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市經各洋行與外洋買方數决電報往還後、市情已略有發展、平水各茶日前已有多數走銷、各路珍眉昨亦　相當成交、計怡和進各路珍眉七百八十箱、內玉山遂安價卅一元至卅四元五角、徽州及普通屯溪價四十九至五十二元、錦隆進銷美莊之鳳眉三百箱、價三十四元、及十六元之秀眉百餘箱、保昌進屯珍百餘箱、價六十二元、及秀眉二百箱、價廿七元、觀塲上成交者以低莊珍眉較多、且查該項存茶已稀云、</p>
<p>又訊、今庚綠茶市况、前因外滙相宜、屯溪鍪源等路高莊貨、易於走銷、中低莊貨、頗多擱滯、近以法國佛郞貶値、華茶運往摩洛哥、成本突高百分之二十以上、而市上玉山開化等路茶、價格亦低至極點、因此之故、低莊綠茶、近來業已微露生機、已由怡和協和錦隆等行、辦進六百餘箱、市盤　出三十一元至三十四元、行情至爲低廉云、　　統計　九月份重要畜產品輸出狀況</p>

<h3 id="c199">麥哲倫Ferdinand　Magellan(1470-1521) <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 樹英</p>
<p>－最初完成世界一周的探險家－</p>
<p>我們翻開世界地圖來看，就可以在南美的最南端，看到一個很著目的海峽，呌做麥哲倫海峽，麥哲倫本來是人名，以人名做海峽名，大家看了，恐怕都要發生一種疑問，並且相信這個海峽，定有其來歷吧。我們下面就是要說這僩海峽的來歷，和發見這個海峽的偉大探險家。</p>
<p>原來從前的人，都以爲地球不是球狀，自從哥倫布發見新大陸後，才證明地球的確是球狀。但是哥倫布以爲他所發見的新大陸，就是印度的一部分，這一點是哥倫布的錯誤，他想像的地球太小，他不知道他所發見的聖薩爾瓦多島，是另一塊西方大陸，中間還隔着茫茫無際的大洋，大洋的彼岸，才是東洋的印度。</p>
<p>但是葡萄牙人麥哲倫所看到的，就不與哥倫布一樣，他認爲哥倫布所到的地方，决不是東洋，在東半球與西半球之間一定還有新的大陸，橫梗其中，若要判東洋，必須經過這塊新大陸，才能到達。所以後來麥哲倫就在這個信念之下，加上他的勇敢與探險的精神，開始他的探險生活，雖然中途經過許多波折，並且　這决探險，喪送了他的生命，但是終於證明他的見解是對的，而最初完成世界一周，也就是他們一行人。</p>
<p>上面我們已經說過，麥哲倫是葡萄牙人，於西歷一四七〇年出世的，比哥倫布小二十歲，所以當哥倫布抵美洲西岸時，他才有十二歲。年長後在葡國艦隊充當志願兵，所以特別精於航海術，通曉地理學，實戰學等，後來因爲種種關係，離開葡萄牙，到西班牙王室服務，不久麥哲倫得到西班牙王的信任，答應帮助似完成探險的志望。</p>
<p>麥哲倫得到西班牙王的帮助後，喜出望外，遂率領二百五十人，乘帆船五隻，於西歷一五一九年九月二十日從西班牙出發，帆船大的兩隻約有一二〇噸左右，其餘三隻較小些。自出發後，日夜兼行，於十一月二十九日始抵南美新大陸，這裏的土人，看見麥等一隊人來，警爲神仙，對他們帝來的東西，視爲珍寳，拿家畜及一切食物來同他們換取小鈴，小刀，鐵斧等等東西。</p>
<p>他們再沿海岸南行，經過了許多前人沒有到過的地方，後來因爲天氣轉壞，不得不暫時停止前進，就在一個呌做聖安周里灣的地方渡過冬天，因此延長預定日期，麥哲倫恐怕食糧不够，以‘後航海發生危險，故决定節制食糧，規定各船員食糧的分量。不幸船員中有嫉妒麥哲倫的成就，而專與麥爲難的，名字呌做卡爾達格那，他率領一部分船員，反對分配食糧，船員受其欺騙者頗不少，打算共分乘三船，離麥而去，幸而在事先被麥哲倫探知此項險謀，他以其過人的才能和手段，才把陰謀破壞，壓服了反對分配食糧的風潮，經他詳加審間後，有許多願意悔過的，仍許其回船，只有卡等數人，始終反對不願悔過，所以在他們的船出發時，便把此數人留在島上，不讓其同道歸來。</p>
<p>叛亂結束後，麥哲倫再令船揚帆，繼續向南前進，然而行行重行行，海岸綫終於連綿不已，欲至之地，渺無影跡，但麥哲倫决不因此失望，勇往向前，終於一五二〇年十月二十一日，走完海岸，發見海峽，這就是我們在地圖上所見釗的麥哲倫海峽。麥氏以堅苦耐勞的心，終於得到這個報酬，水手們此時也歡喜若在，有的竟勸麥從此轉回，說是旣發現海峽，對國家已有莫大的貢獻了，但麥氏仍主張前進，通過海峽，船父到茫茫大洋中，氣候溫和，水波不興，這就是太平洋了。他們以爲通過麥哲倫海峽，不久就可以到東半球了，殊不知船又到大洋中來，但是麥哲倫決不灰心，繼續航行，又是一二個多月，他們食糧已盡，水又汚濁，正將陷入囓食帆布的時候，所幸船員們因受麥哲倫英雄的勇氣所感化，終無畏懼與哀怨之聲，五隻船仍勇往一直向前駛去，但因生活太苦，水不淸潔，病的死的一天比一天多，故决意在拉特侖島休息，數天後又繼續前進，不數日，竟到了菲律賓羣島，菲律賓人以爲他們都是東方的國家，其實他們是來自葡萄牙，是西方國家的旅行者，所以地球是圓的，由此更得證明。</p>
<p>麥哲倫的成功，完全在堅心耐苦和百折不回的毅力。他克服了一切困難，甚至限制食糧，足證「有志者事竟成一的格言。無論什麽人，只要卜了堅心，能够忍耐勞苦，我想定有所成。</p>
<p>但是不宰得很，麥哲倫雖有道樣的大功，開了旅行世界一周的新紀錄，在歷史上有永垂不朽之名的偉人，後來竟因他信奉耶蘇敎，在菲律賓傳佈耶敎，以致引起土人的反對，經土人多方搗亂的結果，他不顧自己人力少，决啻以武力征服土人，他只靠自己的兵器比土人的好，所以他竟大胆帶着六十餘人，與土人一千多人相戰，結果衆寡不敵，敗於土人之手，就在敗退的時候，麥哲倫終被土人的毒槍擊傷，雖然麥亦擊退數十個土人，但終因衆寡太相縣殊，被土人殺死，這絕世的大探險家，要不因爲傳敎，必能平安與同行者回到西班牙。後來他的同行者，於一五二二年九月六日，在盛大的歡迎之下，安抵西班牙，雖然所剩無幾，但週遊世界的事業，却從此成功。</p>
<h3 id="c200">「靖難之變」的方氏黨族禍 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 深綠</p>
<p>凡是一個國家，到了變亂的時候，總會出現忠臣烈士，以殺身成仁，拾生取義，來激發民氣，振起國魂；但當局總是用高壓手段，想來制止道個激烈的行動，結果便演成了種種殘酷的慘劇。</p>
<p>明太祖朱元璋，以平民起義，殺退胡人，統治中國，倒也風調雨順，國泰民安。直到洪武三十一年五月裏，太祖染了重病，一月以後，竟至一病不起。臨終遺囑；皇位由嫡孫允炆承襲，因爲允炆聰明孝友，天下早已歸心，並且循例從嫡，嫡子亡故，理應輪到嫡孫，所以允炆當卽遵囑就位，以明年爲建文元年。這便是惠帝。</p>
<p>那時惠帝有個叔叔，名字呌棣的，生性橫兇，見惠帝的爸爸早故，就有篡佔帝位的意思，太祖也知道他的用意，便把他遣到北平，封爲燕王，以爲這樣一來，他雖有惡意，也勢力遙遠，不能實現了。豈知燕王棣北去後，就秣馬練兵，稱覇一方；太祖死了不久，他更藉口反對惠帝聽用方孝孺等建議更定官制，托名「靖難」，起兵南犯了。</p>
<p>燕王一路打到南京，直入金川門。都城被陷，宮中火起，死了不少的人，惠帝也不知去向了，燕王恐人心不服就命取得皇后的尸骸，備禮殮葬，宜且言惠帝自焚身死，他就自立爲皇一名爲成祖，那是建文四年六月的事。七月，成祖改那年爲洪武三十五年，廢除新制，恢復舊制，明年爲永樂元年。在成祖當時以爲這樣做，是應天順人的，那裏顧到後世的非論呢。</p>
<p>這裏再說起方孝孺先生，他是浙江省寗海縣人，他的爸爸克勤，是洪武年間的一個好官，孝孺從少就聰慧異人，有「小韓子」之譽；到大來品行端莊，學問淵博，明太祖稱他爲莊士」；蜀獻王也曾聘他做世子的敎師，題其書舍呌「正學廬」：到惠帝卽位。召爲侍講，一切大政，都是和他商議好了，然後施行和。</p>
<p>成祖旣用暴力篡佔了惠帝的帝位，因爲聽納姚廣孝的話，以爲方孝孺是天下的讀書種子，不可殺害他，所以成祖當即位時，就把他召來，命他起草詔文，孝孺因惠帝被迫自殺，國位被僭，非常悲憤，就通身穿著孝服，哭上殿來。那時成祖下榻勸慰道：「先生何必這樣悲傷呢？我不過學周公輔助成王罷了！」孝孺聽了氣憤的說</p>
<p>「成王在那裏」？</p>
<p>「他自己焚死了」。</p>
<p>「那末何不立成王的兒子呢」？</p>
<p>「國家全靠長君」。</p>
<p>「那末何不立成王的弟」？</p>
<p>「這是騰的家事，不要你管」，</p>
<p>這時成祖有了怒意，敎左右把筆墨紙札交給孝孺，說道：「紹文非先生起草不可！」孝孺以這是悖叛大義的事，不能爲威武以屈服，把筆丟在地上，且哭且駡道：「……你要殺就殺罷，要我覃詔是不肯的」燕王那裏肯休，怒道：「你怎能就死得這麽便宜，我還要滅你的十族哩！」威逼着定要他寫，孝孺知勢如路虎，不能罷休。索性寫了「燕賊篡位」四個大字，遞將上去，成祖看着，眞個是「怒從心上起，惡向胆邊生」，立命侍衛將他繫逮下獄。後來便同尚書齊泰太常卿黃子澄綁到市上斬了。孝孺臨刑的時候，慨然就死，一點也不悲傷，並做了一首絕命詞道：</p>
<p>「天降亂離兮孰知其由？</p>
<p>奸臣得計兮謀國用猶。</p>
<p>忠臣發憤兮血淚交流，</p>
<p>以此徇　兮抑復何求？</p>
<p>嗚呼哀哉兮庶不我允。</p>
<p>那時他還只有四十六歲。</p>
<p>他的妻鄭氏，和兩個兒子－中憲中愈－，聽到這個消息，都自縊而死，兩個女兒－貞，淑－也投在秦淮河裏自殺了，</p>
<p>孝孺的弟弟孝友，常案發就刑時，孝孺見着他，不覺傷心落淚，孝友却口吟一絕道：</p>
<p>「阿兄何必泪澘澘？</p>
<p>取義成仁在此間，</p>
<p>領表柱頭干載後，</p>
<p>旅魂依舊到家山。」</p>
<p>這多悲壯呀！有是兄必有是弟，眞眞不錯。</p>
<p>他的朋友學生們，被當局指爲「方黨」，而被遺謫或處死刑的眞不知有多少，如童伯綠調戍盧龍，張祐兄弟五人編發邊衛，陜西按察僉事鄭公智，林熹猷各論死，太常少卿盧原質和弟盧原樸滅家，進士張祐和兪尹璋也因此自殺。……</p>
<p>滅族的行文到了先生的故里－寗海－，寗海縣當局那敢怠慢，火速派兵搜捕，眞弄得鬼哭神號，鷄犬不奪，其族人　成，先後被殺的，共計八百二十七入，尸積成山，血流成渠，無人敢去收拾。那時有個名呌馬子同的，激於義憤，便把這許多尸首丟入一個井裏，自己也跳下井去自殺了，後來這口井裏的水，不知紅了多少日子。到了萬曆年間，縣令吳萊才在這井上建了一個亭子，題上「義井忠泉一四字，現在這義井亭還在寗海城內大街，凡是經過的人，無不表示憑吊和景仰。</p>
<p>當時凡藏孝孺文章的，都論死罪，他的同鄉章樸先生，因爲收藏方集。被寗波郡序班楊善所告發，成祖非常生氣，把他捕去，他的弟弟宗簡也跟了走，哭着打着」登聞鼓」，情願什死，也就一同被逮。審判時章樸說。。孝孺旣因效忠國家而被戮，他的文章，大都更是閘揚先王之道，不能算是罪惡的東西！」法官把這話傳給成祖，成祖更生氣，立命綁赴市上斬首，章樸臨死時顏色不變，從容吟詩，宗簡也吟詩相和，他們就一同被殺了。（現在行世的文集，是王稌抄傳下來的。）</p>
<p>因爲人人危懼黨禍，恐被累及，方孝孺的尸骸也沒人敢去收拾。他的表侄鄭珣，到浦江和他的學生王稌計劃到金陵負遺骸歸葬故鄉，却被當局知道，被捕下獄，後來因爲成祖偶然想到王稌的祖父王褘，是先朝的忠臣，特予赦宥，而方先生的遺骸，仍被草草的葬在南京聚實門外，那裏就是他就刑的地方。</p>
<p>當方氏被滅族時，人人都是嘆息方氏無後，眼看要絕嗣了。幸得孝孺的次子意，爲前刑部尚齊邑尉魏潭所藏　，就此傳下一脈。那時有個秀才兪學夔，是寗海人，探知這個消息，非常欣喜，但他對魏澤有些懷疑，不敢直去認，乃假裝瘋人，在金陵市上乞食，一天，在城隅碰着魏澤，就狂歌道：</p>
<p>「當年豫讓豈純臣，猶肯呑炭併漆身。</p>
<p>堪笑今來執政者，叩頭新主乞恩綸。」</p>
<p>又道：</p>
<p>「不慚周粟可偷生，首陽節義如　萍。</p>
<p>向日都兪今反目，區區尚願效程嬰。」</p>
<p>魏澤理會他的意思，故意喝道：「瘋子走開！」隔二天，又在市上碰着，仍舊在佯歌唱，魏澤乃秘密地寫了一封信給他，把孝孺文稿，和方憲也盡託付與他。學夔便帶了方憲航海匿居島中，一個月後看看無動靜，才沿着海邊走到松江靑村，每天捕魚度日，後來打聽出華亭縣裏的兪允任勉二人，是孝孺的鬥生，學夔便入城訪問，並交出魏澤的信，二人看了又驚又喜，就設法安置他們二人。因爲黨禁嚴密，他們改姓余，遷住白沙里，日耕夜讀，方氏後裔，在兪義士保護之下，就住在華亭縣了。</p>
<p>方先生爲爭正義而犧牲，諸烈士爲擁護正義而慷慨就義，當此國難日亟的時候，給予我們如何的啟示啊！</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3 id="c201">談談雜誌 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 胡行之</p>
<p>－並有兩個要求－</p>
<p>書籍為人生求知的食糧，凡是近代的人都沒有不需要牠的。不要說成人是需要，卽兒童也是需要，所以一國的文化程度如何，只要看這一國的出版物之質與量就可以爲斷。</p>
<p>惟書籍範圍太廣，有專門的硏究書，有學校的敎科書，也有消閒的小說等等，非一時所能盡談，現在我所要說的，爲雜誌一項。</p>
<p>所謂雜誌，其實也包羅萬象。因其性質不同，也有專門的，也有一般的，也有專重文藝的，也有專重經濟或政治以至於世界大勢的，甚至專以漫畫或曲綫美爲號召者，形形色色，五花八門，眞是盡世界之大觀。</p>
<p>但不管形式是如何多，種類是如何複雜，大別之，則可分爲三類。即軟性的，硬性的，及硬軟兼收的是。</p>
<p>一般以研究學術爲主者，通常謂爲硬性的，以消閒爲主的，則謂爲軟性的，而一半供給知識，一半含有消遣性質的，則謂之硬軟兼收的刋物。不過絕對硬性的少，以絕對軟性或硬軟兼備的，較佔多數。</p>
<p>就發刊的時期上說，有定期刊物和不定期刊物二種。定期的有年刊，季刊，兩月刋，月刋，半月刋，週刋………等，不定期的大半為學社的集團刊物，研究性的居多。</p>
<p>以前的雜誌，尤其在革命潮流澎湃的時候，動輒談論政治，大半含有鼓吹性與宜傳性的。近時政治稍形安定，研究學術之風較盛，所以專門硏究性的刋物，已稍抬頭，這不能說不是一可喜的現象。其實，也是必然的現象。</p>
<p>不過世界形勢，正在澎湃的波動，國際變化，瞬息萬變，以是研究國際淸形的刊物，尚是極爲發達，這也是時代所促成的。</p>
<p>學術智識，雖是人人需要，但資本主義下的敎育制度，窮人是沒法享受讀醫的權利，以是應這需要而起，有所謂種種帮助自學的雜誌，「讀書靑年」，「讀書月刊」………等就是。</p>
<p>世界經濟不景氣，農村破產，社會上失業的人，日益增加，於是想謀一種副業，以爲自生之道，於是就有所謂「農村副業月刊」，「養鷄雜誌」等等的出現了。</p>
<p>靑年徬徨岐途，多是喜讀文藝作品，以爲精神上的安慰，從前創造社出版的種種小說和雜誌，博得了許多靑年的歡迎，就是明證。所以文藝刊物到現在還是在盛旺發展之路，「作家」「文學家「中流」「譯文」以及「文學」「文藝季刊」等等，好像是層出不窮的。</p>
<p>也有刊物是以人爲對象，如專對中學生的，有開明的「中學生」，北新的「靑年界」，正中的「靑年月刊」等等；專對敎育界爲對象的，有「敎育雜誌」「敎育界」「初等敎育」等等；至以小學生爲對象的，則是更不勝枚舉了，不過大多是圖文並重的。</p>
<p>最近又有所謂幽默雜誌的出現了。這種幽默性的雜誌，平心說來，也自有可取之處，不過不應以幽默爲正經。「宇宙風」「論語」，便是此派雜誌的代表。</p>
<p>由幽默的分支，兼採革命掌故，而以談文史爲號召者，有逸經，銷路亦稱不惡。</p>
<p>人不向上即向下，但向上如逆水行舟，不是極有把握者不能，於是便都容易向下了。肉慾性感，是最易引誘人的；嘻笑漫駡，是最易博人歡喜的，於是爲投時人所好，便有種種無聊的刊物出現。滿篇曲綫肉感，女人裸像，「王先生別傳」，「漫畫界」，「漫畫世界」等，不一而足。這也是想在無聊中求慰安的心理而出發的。其與此合拍者，有海上之一元五票的跳舞塲，少女歌舞團，以至按摩室及不堪形容的玩意兒等等。</p>
<p>硬性刊物專供學術上的研究的，或者是給人當一種知識的鎖　。閱之有益，但可惜現在這種有價節的刊物太少了。</p>
<p>就性質上分，雖有軟性與硬性之不同，但最好是要硬性者亦把牠軟性化。「歷史小品」，「科學小品」，即是這種手法之創製。其實何嘗以「歷史」「科學」如是呢？「政治」「經濟」及其他，也未嘗不可如是。</p>
<p>旣名雜誌，當求其雜。但維者不是全無系統，即要新鮮活潑之意。材料當瀾應環境時令，編排當力求活潑，封面揷畫，應時時變換，不要使人一見如故，毫不能引起興趣。</p>
<p>軟性的刋物，雖是在討人喜歡，但千篇一律，久而亦要生厭。我以爲軟中略可硬化，換言之，即應具有知識性的文字和圖畫。</p>
<p>定期刊物，初多月刊，近則最流行的爲半月刊，决之爲周刊。時期太長，猶如典籍，時期太短，其篇幅自薄，一覽無餘，亦無意義。故較軟性的自以半月刊爲宜，較硬性的，則以月刊爲適當</p>
<p>我國雜誌，十年前是大多不能按期出版的。現在各雜誌總算都能準時出版了。有幾家也有早出。但有幾家尚不能如期，總應力求準確爲是。</p>
<p>雜誌之最討厭的，爲腰斬。出了創刊號，或者是出了五期十期便停版了，這是使一般讀者多麽悵惘啊。</p>
<p>中國近時雜誌雖多，尚無內容十分充實的雜誌。如日本的「中央公論」「改浩」「新潮」等，質量俱佳，洵屬難得。我在這裏，很希望集中人村及資力，辦一個最理想的雜誌。</p>
<p>我還有一個最後的要求，卽是希望大家合力，來辦一個最通俗的雜誌，務使人人能懂，個個有味，在極淺近極有趣的文字裏，來促成敎育的普及，提高文化的水準</p>
<p>不知這麽一點願望，何時能够實現？</p>

<p>在目前的出　界正鬧着「荒蕪」「不充實」的現在，要找一本爲學生們作最忠實的報導和研究以”指不的刊物，我覺得「中國學生」是値得推薦的。</p>
<p>有一些雜誌，常使讀者在讀後感到毫無意義，有時還會感到極度的空虛。這在「中國學生」顯然是沒有這種現象，而會給讀者們一個美滿的收獲。自然，這裏最大的原因，就是「中國舉生」，純粹是以中國現階段爲對象，而代替夢生們解决許多切身的問題，這是「中國學生」，是告成功的一點！</p>
<p>就是以最近出版的第三卷八期而言：展開了成幅的「全國童子軍大檢閱」的對面圖後，除學生方面自己所撰的文字以外，而且還包含了一個「我考進了大學以後」的特輯，而原有的「各地學生生活」，「學生呼聲」等，還楚一仍其舊。給學生們一個指導和修養的，那是有「每週評論」，「現代敎育」，「修養講話」，「國際時事講話」，「文藝集體」等欄，另外還具有純報道性的趣味化的「學府新聞」，專爲學生們創辦的刊物而內容如此充實，實在値得我們稱道與推薦的，筆者是很忠實地爲讀者介紹這本定期刋物。</p>
<h3 id="c203">從「談風」說到幽默 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 哲人</p>
<p>不久之前，在有些報上看到一點消息，說又將有一個幽默雜誌快要出版了，名字呌『談風』，並說他們發刊旨趣是鑒於林語堂先生之主張『幽默』，三四年來苦心孤詣地而猶未得到成功，『談風』是要完成林語堂先生未竟之志的。不錯，我們讀者總是歡迎的，至少，荒蕪的出版裏也算多一種刋物了。</p>
<p>「談風」是二十五日出版的，但我們二十二日就看到了，這現象多少是好的。可是內容呢？封面上是印着林語堂先生的原稿，翻開來卷首的揷圖是「觀迎」林先生去國的照片，背面又是林先生的手跡；文字呢？是有林先生的「與友人書」，另外「緣起裏也有說不完的林先生，自然，末了的「編餘贅語」裏更非提到林先生不可，偉矣哉！語堂先生也！</p>
<p>對於這樣一種刊物，主張淸閑，滿腔士大夫氣，一派風雅氣象，我們是不能給它一個較高的評價的。可是在這裏我們不能不提到他們所不喊的幽默了。我說「幽默」是不能單獨存立的一種文學作品，我們所能承認「幽默」是文學中的一種風格，假使嚴正地說起來，那是文學中的一個小丑而已。不過，我們承認「幽默」是天才，是先天的遺傳，而不是後天的學習，更不是勉强的模仿就可以。假使「幽默」是受不了苦悶的現實而由內心所發出的慨嘆，那未，對於目前悲慘的境遇未免看得太小了，太輕了。</p>
<p>至於那批提倡「幽默」者推崇晚明的袁中郎袁小修等，那更是笑話，這不啻他們自認「幽默」爲士大夫文學的借尸還魂的鐵證了！</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3 id="c205">夫婦感情淡薄的恢復方策 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>……夫婦間若發生性的障碍後家庭間就充滿着「失和「痛苦」「淡薄」原素　……「性力」健全則夫婦生活的基礎穩固纔能够產生所謂純潔的兩性之愛　……不僅是這樣而且將來有絕嗣的危險希望賢明的夫婦們必須特別注意</p>
<p>兩性的結合本來為求快樂與幸福，但有的竟大相逕庭，不但沒有所謂快樂及幸福，家庭間竟充滿著「痛苦」「失各」「淡薄」的原素。這是什麼緣故呢？其原因固然有種種不同，但其中最主要者，厥因夫婦間發生性的障碍症所致。照事理方，本來構成夫婦生活的基礎，就在「性力」的健全，「性力』健全之後，纔能够產生所謂「兩性之愛」，假若夫婦間因了身體的不濟喪失此性愛的原動力之後，無論你容貌怎樣端正，環境怎樣舒適，夫婦的感情依然不會美滿，能在不知不覺間遭遇淡薄的感覺。</p>
<p>但性的障碍症主角，百分之八十以上均屬男性，男性何以獨多此現象？類多因性的神經衰弱而起，例如幼年時代的過度手淫，致主宰發育及性能的靑春腺（卽生殖腺）遭受摧殘，結果性器的發育被迫停止，同時性生活主要的勃起力爲之不能。</p>
<p>此外，雖非手淫之故，或因早婚，或在婚後濫用性器，或於未婚前涉足娼寮，致身染淋毒，使生殖腺受損，性神經衰弱症遂不能免。早洩，陽萎，夢遺，遺精等都是上述幾種原因而誘起的症狀。</p>
<p>在女子方面，祇是冷淡症與不感症兩種。息者能使男子性神經衰弱增加，二者間有着互相因果的關係。</p>
<p>但夫婦間無論那一方面，若有上述缺陷時，美滿的家庭自然就會生出破綻，結果發生許多意外的爭議，與悲劇，以給報紙充實內容。不僅是這樣，而且將來有絕嗣的危險，希望賢明的夫婦們要特別注意，並深加反省？</p>
<p>所以夫婦間無論那一方面，若發現前述症狀時，務須阜期施以適當治療，以奠定夫婦間幸福的基礎。</p>
<p>關於其治療方法，依余多年來的經騐，及國外名醫與病院的推薦，此時應服以眞正生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」。</p>
<p>「生殖素」係從雄壯動物的生殖腺提取其精華而製成，故服後能使靑春腺强壯，性的機能活潑而亢進，使不姙者獲孕。陽萎，早洩消失無蹤，惟有遺精者應兼以「希米脫氏固精片」止之。如有淋病者，則同時須服黃色素伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」則其奏效，遠勝他藥</p>
<p>療養指導</p>
<h3 id="c206">骨節酸痛的根本療法 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>……本症的發生純由瘋濕血毒的侵襲　……本治及兩種制劑確具實效</p>
<p>最使人惴惴不安者，莫如老年時的骨節酸痛了。骨節酸痛一症，並非說老年人必患之症。不過本症在年歲較高者，因抵抗力薄弱，靑年時所受的瘋濕與血毒乘機侵襲，因此罹者普遍。如能早期預防，或衛生得當，卽可避免，卽使發作，亦不若想像的劇烈了。反之，在靑年時卽可爆發。例如體弱者在工作稍繁後卽能感覺腰背酸痛之苦，此種人一入暮年，必被骨痛症劇烈侵襲無疑。</p>
<p>年輕人的腰背酸痛，卽爲將來年老時骨痛的導線，也就是半身不遂症的候補者。</p>
<p>每一個半身不遂患者，必經過腰背酸痛的發作，若放任不治，能蔓延及於全身骨節，四肢麻木，筋絡抽攣，結果，動脈漸形硬化，悲慘的中風症遂卽實現。</p>
<p>因此之故，對於吾人日常的疾病療養不可不知。第一應知本症發作的原因，完全由於瘋濕內蘊與血份不潔。故根本療法，必須服具有袪瘋，除濕，淸毒及預防動脈硬化功效的「强斯登氏骨痛片」，余留德十年關於治療本症的對症良藥，首推此片，同時應曉得「生殖素」能使吾人精神充足，抵抗力增强。故體弱者。盡多服此以預防骨痛的發作，故連帶提及</p>

<h3 id="c207">尿酸促成骨痛的治法 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>生活的担子緊壓着世界上每一個人，使他們終日奔波，儘量出賣其精力，只在每日短暫的餘暇，方得少停喘息，過度的疲勞帶來了血液中過量的尿强酸，這些酸素漸結成晶體，鑽入骨節之間，正像赤裸的足踏在碎玻璃上似的，這些酸素的結晶擦得骨節痛澈心肺</p>
<p>於是許多給生活壓得喘不過氣的人們，當他們還需要和運命掙扎時，竟以骨節痠痛，逢節或操勞太甚，便宛轉呻吟於枕席之間，病痛大發時，不消說，工作也無法繼續，坐視一家老幼忍飢耐寒，走頭無路</p>
<p>現代的醫學專家，均能本數十年的經騐，以硏究發明對症良藥爲己任，像美國强斯登博士的發明骨痛片，卽其例也</p>
<p>「强斯登氏骨痛片」的功效，確眞袪瘋除濕，淸血毒，防尿酸及預防動脈硬化的種種特點，故近數年來，雖有數千百種同樣的藥類問世，均不能與之比並。</p>
<p>各國名醫對該藥之推崇，有口皆碑，據倫敦『科學雜誌』所載云：這位一生以濟人利世爲志的醫學家强斯登博士，能紋蓋自己的腦汁，作過無數决的試騐，成此確具巨效的片劑，僅在英倫一地每年藉此特效的骨痛片治愈息者不下數十萬人公認爲治骨痛的唯一良藥云</p>

<h3 id="c208">遺精應有深思遠慮的必要 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>……遺精若不治愈能使性神經衰弱異常使有妻子增惡的危險　……性教育普及的歐美青年均知及早治療故所蒙弊害亦較少</p>
<p>丈夫性能的薄弱－如陰萎早洩，已成爲離婚案之主要理由之一。女權昌明的今日，婦女們已不甘忍着一肚皮幽怨，只於背人處偷彈珠淚；她們爲了爭取人生應享的利益，不能不與那種虛有其表的男人仳離。翻開報紙一看，這樣的新聞决非少見。每個未婚的靑年，覩此當有所警覺，及早檢討自身的狀態，以像防他年之悲劇。</p>
<p>此等陰萎早洩之疾决非驀然出現的，遺精常是他們的前驅。原來壯盛的靑年於精液充沛之際，滿極而溢，或半月，或一月而一度遺精固屬無害，但若每二三日，或每日，密接地常常遺洩，這現象所表現的除了精關寬吔以外，還有什麽別的呢？</p>
<p>精關旣然寬弛，患者必然難以控制其射精作用；精液的遺漏旣多，人生的資源消耗過度，精神過勞，神經中樞疲乏，勃起力入於麻痺狀態，遂成陰萎。所以不論就理論或事實言，遺精和陰萎早洩實有不可分離的關係。每個遺精病患者皆應自知他日有做一個令妻不滿足丈夫的資格。</p>
<p>若干愚昧的人士以爲結婚之後，遺精卽能自愈，這未免是種太可笑的幻想，須知性神經衰弱的症候，加一個滿足性慾的機會是會更嚴重一昼的。歐美各國性敎育已漸普及，一般靑年都洞明個中利害，均知於婚前及早治愈，以增進他日之幸福的。幷且醫藥的進步已使他們無需乞靈於醫士的診察，只要購藥自療就成。德國希米脫博士是他們的便利的施與者，他以畢生的苦心，硏究成功一種特效片劑，名爲「米脫氏固精片」，具有鞏固精關的偉大效力，一經服用，射精作用更得到一重的束，不會泛濫橫决。</p>
<p>斯丹那博士採取新鮮的　壯　物之生殖腺內分泌精液，提煉製成『生殖素』一藥，更與「米脫氏固精片」有相得益彰之效。原來固精片的效力止于精關的鞏固，至於精神過勞及精液之過度消耗所造成之虛弱現象，當服用「。生殖素」以補救之。使生殖腺之分泌旺盛，人生所需資源充足而無耗竭之患，那麼自然而然精强力壯，性神經衰弱的病態一掃而空，結婚以後，必不致爲嬌妻所輕視了。</p>

<p>（二）少年縱欲之流毒及挽救</p>
<p>患者林文通，年二十五歲，福建泉州人。主訴——少時爲侍婢所誘，屢行非禮，致阻發育，成未老先衰之狀。病歷——幼而喪母，繼母遇之酷，輒與故婢某同宿，林君十齡時，婢年已十八，頗解風情，誘少主與爲非禮之行，童子無知，習以爲常，十四歲時已發育，益縱慾，遂爲終身之害。林君十六歲時，其婢適人，始得厲行攝生，然身體發育不良，腦力薄弱，學業每落人後，自感身同廢人，未敢言婚娶。治療方法——施以電療手術，幷投以大量生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，使生殖腺重事正規之發育成熟，俾內分泌旺盛，性機能恢復，精神充足，腦力發達，施治三月，所有目的果得完全達到。（「希米脫氏固精片」與「生殖素」均用鐵盒裝；舊用紙盒瓶裝之存貨早已收回取消，市上現所發現之紙盒者皆奸商影射之僞貨。愼勿怏服而致受害）</p>

<p>我的戒煙經過</p>
<p>追憶以往的創傷　慶祝今後的餘生</p>
<p>我開始吸鴉片的第一日，早在十二年前當江浙齊慮內戰的時候。我最初吸煙的地方，是在愛多亞路大名鼎鼎的寳裕里，這是我還牢牢記着的。祇經過一星期的同流合污，就使我足足做了十二年的老槍，我所以這樣容易成癮的緣故，實在因為素有毛病。</p>
<p>當我吸上鴉片煙的第四年，會被法捕房拘去羈捕一夜，罰了三十元方始釋出。從此之後，我再也不敢在燕子窩裏吸煙了。我就向家庭疏通，因我素有疾病，經過幾决惋轉陳述，居然如願以償，從此我在家裏吸煙了。我有個伯父，他是最要面子的。見了我如此下流，大發脾氣，硬要我戒除，並且向我的父親警告。渾然，我在這種情況之下，就開始戒煙了。弄得我奄奄一息，不僅骨瘦如柴，精神也陷入昏迷狀態，我實在不能支持了。他們見了此種情形，恐防我生命危險，祇得任我重復吸煙。到了今年秋初，因爲家庭的每况愈下，由曾戒的朋友指導，服以生殖腺素製劑「生殖紫」作培補戒煙，因爲朋友說我身體太弱，非此不可，果然，實行此合理的戒煙法後，以前所嘗到的戒煙痛苦，此次已不復感覺了，祇服兩月，完全斷癮。恩之眞幸運也。（按眞正「生殖素」槪係鐵盒裝，有裝紙盒者皆爲胃牌貨）</p>

<p>……乳房的高聳臀部的曲線都可期望　……近代的美容術已達登峯造極之境</p>
<p>採取雄壯動物靑春腺（卽生殲腺）內分泌的精華，以補充人體生殖腺內分泌的不足，卽能使其人的衰老俄延。面部的皺痕卽能隱沒，同時容顏的色澤嬌艷，保持常年靑春，此確爲近代美容術最進步的獲得，而且在學術上也是最有趣味的貢獻。</p>
<p>當此法尚未發明之前，有巴黎的女醫，以其手法巧妙，能使五六十歲老太婆的皺臉，變成豐潤光滑，但此手術，經過幾個月以後，較比原來的皺皮，更見增劇，結果是大爲失敗。故自補充生殖腺紫於人體的美容術發明以來，不美的女子無需施用手術，祇須服眞正生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」之後，能使生殖腺轉强，消化器及新陳代謝的機能促進，皮膚的脂肪組織逐漸旺盛，不僅容顏嬌美，同時發育轉佳，乳房也就高聳而豐腴，臀部的曲線驟然顯露，故近代科學的進步，已達登峯造極之境，此不僅美容術而已。</p>

<h3 id="c215">「道德淪亡」乎？ <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>現在是復古派們搖頭嘆息於「道德淪亡」的年頭，尤其是談起女人，古得可以的大人先生們更不惜找出許多許多的忠謚加在她們頭上，好像中國之所以到現在這樣地步者，完全是這般「妖孽」們所作的「孽」。</p>
<p>細按實際，現在女人們的裝飾，和復古派的母親們時代的裝飾，的確是大不相同了，例如頭髮：復古派的母親們腦後大概總是有一個髮髻的，而現在，則卽使不是燙髮，上海的年靑的女人們大概總已經成了「鴨屁股」。再例如脚，復古派的母親們是有一雙「三寸金蓮」的，而現在的一般女人們，卽使不是天足，也總早已把裹脚布解掉了，變成爲「文明脚」。據復古派說起來，脚大是爲了容易逃難，所以近來的內憂外患，日漸加深者，還是由於女人的脚的解放引來的。至於男人的脚大是否是主逃難？那却似乎沒有回答。</p>
<p>但其實，女人的服裝卽使跟以前不同，她們的舊道德觀念還是依舊的，例如「寗波女子王美麗，年華二八，……見女貌美，屢思勾引，女終不之理，嗣復有信函數通寄給，女亦不答，致於十八晚九時許，徐曾派男子三名往女之居處，該三人均自稱爲新聞記者，並邀女需於明日出外與徐會晤，如不從則欲將伊與徐之戀愛經過披露報章，種種恫嚇言詞，女因而畏懼，出此自殺之心，……」。照理如果換了種裝飾，就是把「道德淪亡」了的話，那位「年華二八」的王小姐是决不會「因而畏懼，出此自殺之心」的。然而，他終於「自殺」了。——果眞是「自殺」的嗎？並不，她是被舊道德觀念殺死的。因爲她怕新聞記者（？）把她的　戀愛經過（就姑且承認有戀愛關係的吧！）披露報章」，以致「出醜露乖」。</p>
<p>至於這三個自稱爲新聞記者的是否是眞的新聞記者呢？因爲現在還沒有下文，無法斷定。就姑且說新聞記者中有這樣的害羣之馬罷，如果那位王小姐是受了新思潮的洗禮的話，她是會無懼於把戀愛經過在報章上發表的（事實上我們也沒有見過正當的報紙有把一個女工的戀愛在報紙上披露的）然而，正因爲那位王小姐受舊道德的毒太深，認戀愛爲見不得人面的「醜事」，於是被自稱爲新聞記者的有隙可乘，而一個純潔的大有可爲的年靑的生命也就此休矣。以此例彼，在相同遭遇下被舊道德所吞噬的生命不知道有多少。</p>
<p>然而，復古者却還是口口聲聲的在說「道德淪亡」。好像現在民族的奄奄無生氣，對任何事情不敢反抗者，全是因爲「道德淪亡」的緣故。</p>

<p>秦始皇，漢武帝，是最著名的求不死之方者。他們以天下享，自然不肯放棄這種快樂而死去。而魏晋的號稱灑脫的士大夫，也努力的服藥，可見卽使「灑脫」，對於生死，也不肯馬虎的。「千古爲難唯一死」？</p>
<p>死掉，自然萬事都已，也不會再感到寂寞了。他們的死的寂寞，到是在生的時侯，看到別入的死去而感到的。世說載：</p>
<p>「王濬爲尚書令，着公服，乘軺車，經黃公酒墟下過，顧謂後車客：吾昔與稽叔夜，阮嗣宗，共酣飮此壚，竹林之游，亦豫其末。自稽生夭，阮公亡以來，便爲時所羈紲，今日視此雖近，邈若山河」！</p>
<p>「王子猷子敬俱病篤，而子敬先亡。子猷問左右，「何以都不聞消息？此已喪矣」，語時不悲，便索輿來喪，都不哭，子敬素好琴，便徑入坐靈床上取子敬翠彈，弦旣不調，擲地云：子敬子敬，人琴俱亡，」因慟絕良久，月餘亦卒。」</p>
<p>「一棺附身，萬事都已，」這當然引起朝露的人生之感。「大哉死乎，君子休焉，小人息焉！」其實，什麽君子與小入，什麽英雄與豪傑，一死眞的什麽都完了，這有生物以來，就有的威脅，使人類成了非常深固的恐死症。世說更載：</p>
<p>「任育長嘗從棺邸下度，流涕悲哀，王丞相曰：此是有情痴」，其實王丞相的話，是不對的，任育長的所以流淚，主要的，是因爲感到自己的將來，也將如此。所以，後人的不肯寫關於死的文章，甚至於避諱死之一字，都是這種恐死症的極度發揮罷了。</p>
<p>舊俄契訶夫有一個劇本，名呌「人之一生，」這是一個象徵劇，他用一個拿着一支蠟燭的灰色的人，象徵着自然，他初燃着蠟燭時說：「一個人生出了」。他在蠟燭燃到中段時，脫明他的各種生活；終於在蠟燭熄時說：「這一個人死掉了。」這灰色的劇本；實在有力的說朋了人生的無常。同時更具體的表示了像蠟燭熄滅一樣的死的概念。使我們讀了，這本劇本，不自止的心會沉重了起來。</p>
<p>此外，我更舉出一篇呌做「紅的笑」的小說，在那裏，作者把「死」寫成「紅的笑，通紅的沒有牙齒的笑」。這實在，眞的使人恐怖，</p>
<p>中國文學中，關於死的最有合作品，是「薤露歌」，但是這篇東西中，主要的意思，還不過說「人生早露」此後，關於這種意思的作品，我們看得太多了。還魂記：「如花美眷，如水流年」。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>二句曾經陶醉過多少人的靈魂。但是讀者仔細想，這二句中，所含的悲哀，除了年華像水一樣的流去，一天天接近死亡外還有什麽？雖說「美人自古如名將，不許人間見白頭，」而有多少白髮老嫗，當時也是朱顏美女呢？我們到底沒有看邊因爲保持美貌靑春而自殺的人</p>
<p>旣然不甘寂寞，又不能避免死，於是他們就創造出死後有知，和鬼」來安慰自己了　我們在熟人中，往往看到篤信鬼神的老人，他們的年青時代，也是不大相信的。原因是自知離去世之期近，不製造出一個安慰自己的觀念來，又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>除了相信死沒有知外，就是「務留身後之名」了，這當然也是不甘寂寞的表現。不過，更爲「無可奈何」罷了。</p>
<p>「前不見古入，後不見來者，念天地之悠悠，獨愴然而涕下，」在陳子昂的這篇詩中，我們嗅到了死的寂寞。</p>
<p>自然對於「死」比較達觀一點永久的人，也不是沒有的，舌筆錄云：</p>
<p>「裴晋公性弘達，不好服食，每語人曰，鷄猪魚蒜，逢着則吃：生老病死，時至則行」</p>
<p>同時，劉伶載酒荷鏟曰「死便埋我」這種眞止曠達不但力矯當時「服食」之習並且更譏笑了多少假超脫也。</p>
<p>至于近人，那末，魯迅先生死前發表的一篇「死」也是一篇决絕的關于死的文章，最後讓我抄二句成語來作「死者已矣，生者何堪」？這才是我寫這篇東西的原因！江文通李太白的賦恨不是都以「一朝魂斷飮恨千秋爲主嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c219">樂培園 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——赶　個月廿三的土地廟，我准在廟里等你。</p>
<p>一個久病的同級學友，環境壓迫他走上懦弱的衰亡的路，那麽一個大家庭，又恰巧有優美的享受，在古老的被對建勢力埋伏最深的故城里，是不允許所謂「少爺有放肆的舉動的，這，纏在他周圍的，除了牌聲酒氣之外，想溜一趟公園或者比較淸靜些的地方換一下空氣，那簡直休想，「家敎」不給他有這樣的空閒。</p>
<p>於此，肺病在逐漸的伸張起來，飮食·課程，什麼都跟他無緣·之後，他還該威謝病的施給，得藉了「診病」的題目走出來痛快的領略一下「家庭」以外的環境。</p>
<p>不用說，這次他約我到土地廟，也是用同一的手法，目的是不難想像得到的，在信的結尾，他還怕把地方弄錯，特別指出來是在靠近章儀門的那一個，</p>
<p>這請求，我沒有方法拒絕，計算着日子，還有兩天天！</p>
<p>廟會在故城里算不得希奇的，每個月輪流的舉行着，什麽逢三（註）土地廟，逢十隆福寺之類的旣成習俗，會輕巧的印在一般老於奔走的人的心上，那樣子，還有些像「赶塲」的雛形，但在規模上是完善得多了。各色貨物從整個的廟里伸展到半條街上，人，擠着，讓聲浪打成了一片，挑選，爭奪，呌喊，謾駡……太平凡了，已引不起人們的注意。</p>
<p>懷了欣快的心情，遵守了的定的時間，赶到了廟里，然而，沒有的定一個相當固定的地點，人又那樣多，怎樣能去尋找這肺病侵襲的小老人呢？沿了連親的布棚子轉着，轉着，之後，我想他也許在廟後的那個大空塲子里，被可愛的花草吸住了，那里使他戚覺到無上的趣味？</p>
<p>這里的人也不在少數，又那里有什麽踪影呢？換了張惘的情緒從後身的　一條路上穿過來，街口，掛了「樂培園」的牌子，這條胡同怪生疏的，由形勢上端量，穿了過去，一定就是大街。</p>
<p>簡直是另外的一個環境，雖然和廟曾僅僅祗有一墻之隔，可是，却有兩個世界呵。</p>
<p>衣服刻劃着他們的生活待遇，初秋的風吹着，短打，不穿襪子，敞胸，可以說樣色俱全，街口的那兩個茶館里，有的還高盤着脚掌，挖着脚泥。整條灣曲的胡同里，充滿了嘈雜的景象（未完）</p>

<p>洋白糖</p>
<p>在××帝國主養壓榨下的中國，是沒有一塊安全地方的——東二省是早已亡了：華北也差不多了。上海，也開來了一大批一大批的兵，而走私，也侵入到窮透的農村裏，斷絕了小商人的生活——</p>
<p>李老闆，是個忠厚的長者，但老實人在　世界上是不能生存的，所以給王老闆販了走私糖，搶了他南貨店的生意。他就呌老婆和剛從上海放暑假回來的女兒李華英二人，燒點蓮子湯，想請王老闆及那鄉下的各店老闆吃一頓，乘這機會將私貨問題討論一下，來制照私詔的販賣。</p>
<p>於是，母親和女兒幹緊剝蓮子。母親厭天熱，女兒　談論走私的害處，以致將運子也弄坯了，遭了母親的咕噥。這是，李老闆跑進來。他對于今天的會議，抱着很大的希望：他又談起上海許多學生下鄉緝的事。——這對于母親的封建的腦袋，還以爲「小孩子能做得什麽，還不是一時的高興。」</p>
<p>正說着，李華英的男同學張亦鵬來了，報告學生們立刻要在火車站集中緝私的事，要李華英就去。女兒不管母親的反對，勇敢地答應。</p>
<p>這天來的客人有：</p>
<p>高榮堂——高老闆的代表，一個少年老成的典型。</p>
<p>王老闆——奸滑的販私貨的商人。</p>
<p>劉老闆——胆小的慢性的商人，中國的鄉老頭兒的典型。</p>
<p>於是大家開會了。年輕人是顯示出了靑的浩力？新社會的曙光　　　榮</p>

<p>也覺悟了自己的危機，努力總使　會成功。</p>
<p>會議室的隔壁，那店堂裏，店員和學徒遵照了李老關的話，就銅板狠命的拋在錢櫃裏，以遮飾生意的清淡。</p>
<p>但會議開得毫無結果。王老闊　到車站上有學生緝私的消息，急忙悄悄溜走了，李華英也悄悄溜走到車站上去帮助緝私。而會議的結束，是在店門外的一片「退貨」「退錢」的噪鬧聲中。</p>
<p>結果，羣衆捉住了王老問闆的同黨——火車站的職員，就將王老闆的販私事件暴露了。於是，漢奸——在羣衆的抗×救之努潮中，無疑是不能存在的！</p>

<p>這是一個描寫畢業卽失業的戲，是廣大的中國青年生活的縮影；出路，出路，在這個社會裏何處去找青年的出路，解决青年人的苦悶，是這劇的主題。</p>
<p>劇作者是曾編導過「鄕愁」「上海十四小時」「船家女」的沈西苞氏。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」素描出四個生活在上海的知識青年，他們都是非常善良的，但在這個龐大的會里，却找不到一口飯吃，雖則大學是畢業了。作者是非同情於他們的，但這里不　是點單純的同情，而具着一種有力的指示。</p>
<p>這兒的四個年青人是：頹衰的，他結果是自殺了；積極的，他是失掉了老家從東北回來的，結果打回了老家去；還有兩個是　幹的和樂天的。他們曾找到了職業，但仍然失了棄，作者在這里指示出失業幷不是人的不努力，而是整個的社會問題。</p>
<p>任演這四個角色者是趙丹，呂班，伊明，劉尙文，女角是茵，白楊。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Staff Officer He Zhi returned to Tianjin by military plane from Changchun at 1:00 PM on the 28th. He immediately went to Tashiro's residence in Zhangyuan to report the results of his exchange of views with Itagaki. At 4:00 PM, Tashiro convened a meeting of his staff at his residence to discuss the current situation and diplomatic issues. More than 20 people, including Hashimoto, Iida, He Zhi, and Sentada, participated. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. It is rumored that the Kwantung Army and the North China Army will jointly issue a statement regarding Sino-Japanese diplomatic affairs, but the method of presentation has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to external sources, the North China Army believes that a diplomatic crisis is imminent and that there may be a significant change in Sino-Japanese negotiations. Therefore, Tashiro specifically ordered He Zhi to go to Changchun to exchange views. As a result, there will be further disturbances on the eastern border of Suiyuan within the next few days. Wang Ying's troops have recently completed their reorganization and have been fully replenished, along with the troops of Jin Jia-san and Li Shou-xin. It is feared that there will be incursions within the week. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly appointed Japanese Infantry Brigade Commander stationed in Jinxi, Usayama Kumatarō, along with his adjutants and staff officers, arrived in Tianjin from his post on the morning of the 28th to visit Tashiro and Hashimoto for discussions. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) There are reports that Wang Ying's bandit troops are being transferred eastward to Rehe. The bandit troops in Rehe have mostly concentrated around Weichang, numbering around 10,000. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 27th to discuss the content of the new instructions for Sino-Japanese negotiations to be carried by Consul-General Suma. After discussions between Isogai, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, and Consul-General Suma, the opinions of the Army and Foreign Ministries were completely aligned. At 5:00 PM, Foreign Minister Arita invited Consul-General Suma to his office, personally handed over the instructions based on the consensus of the three ministries (Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry), and held important discussions for one hour regarding the future direction of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Consul-General Suma then met with Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, to discuss administrative issues and to ensure that nothing was overlooked. At 9:30 PM, Consul-General Suma took a fast train from Tokyo Station to quickly return to his post. He plans to meet with Army Attaché Kita and Naval Attaché Sato immediately after arriving in Shanghai. He will arrive in Nanjing on the 1st to convey Foreign Minister Arita's instructions and the opinions of the Foreign Ministry to Ambassador Kawagoe. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Kobe) Suma told a guest here today that he is currently carrying instructions from Foreign Minister Arita to Ambassador Kawagoe, with the aim of making China more aware of Japan's views. The fundamental spirit of these instructions is that Japan's demands have not changed from the beginning. There is no other way but to proceed with the originally established goal. He hopes that China will respond soon to Japan's unchangeable firm attitude, so that the negotiations can be successfully concluded. It was initially believed that the instructions to Kawagoe were a restatement of Japan's firm insistence on fundamentally adjusting Sino-Japanese relations based on the demands already put forward by Japan. Suma's words are sufficient to confirm this. According to reports, Suma, carrying the new instructions from the Japanese government to Ambassador Kawagoe, departed for Shanghai this morning on the French ship Aramis. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before departing for Kobe, Consul-General Suma, stationed in Nanjing, stated in an interview that his mission to return to Japan was to report on the true progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations to the authorities. Foreign Minister Arita, after listening to his report, felt regret that Japan's plans had not been thoroughly understood by China. Therefore, before his return to his post, he handed over various new instructions for him to convey to China. The basis of the new instructions is that there has been no change to Japan's established views. Currently, there is no alternative but to continue forward so that their goals can be achieved smoothly. Ambassador Kawagoe will continue negotiations with China based on the results of his consultations in Tokyo. Furthermore, Consul-General Suma, in a meeting with a Yomiuri Shimbun reporter at Atami, admitted that acknowledging the status quo would mean restricting future development. The Chinese people are currently expressing great anxiety about Japan's intentions, and Japan is also expressing doubts about China. The mission of diplomats is to dispel such psychology. He is now rushing back to his post to continue the war of attrition. Consul-General Suma will depart by ship from Kobe on the afternoon of the 28th and arrive in Shanghai on the 30th, returning to Nanjing on the 31st. Yang Yunzhu, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, traveled to Yokohama with Consul-General Suma on the 27th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Odawara: Consul-General Suma stated in a conversation in the train, saying that he has decided to return to the country to report on the situation of Sino-Japanese negotiations. After Foreign Minister Arita obtained this report, he issued various instructions to him when he was returning to his post. The fundamental expression of these instructions is that Japan's position has not changed from beginning to end. The Japanese government has no other way but to proceed towards the original purpose. After returning to his post, he will convey these instructions to Ambassador Kawagoe and continue negotiations with the Chinese authorities to make the negotiations a satisfactory success. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Odawara: It is planned that Consul-General Suma will meet with Toyota, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau, in Kobe, to report on the policy determined by the Army and Foreign Ministries, and exchange important opinions. (Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Consul-General Suma originally planned to return to his post on the Maya Maru on the 28th, but later changed his plans and will instead travel to Shanghai on the French steamship Aramis. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Osaka: Japanese Consul-General to Nanjing, Suma, arrived in Kobe from Tokyo at 7:30 AM this morning. He immediately visited Toyota, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, and others, to report on his return to the country and his contacts with the Foreign Ministry authorities, listen to the opinions of the naval authorities, and hold important consultations. (China United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Consul-General Suma left Tokyo yesterday and headed west to return to Nanjing. Previously, Foreign Minister Arita summoned Suma to his official residence at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:00 PM in the afternoon, personally gave him new instructions, and conducted the final important discussions, which lasted an hour before ending. Subsequently, Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, also had a long private conversation with Suma. According to informed sources, although the Japanese side's diplomatic policy towards China has not changed, its attitude has become slightly more moderate. The focal points of the negotiations, namely the issues of North China and anti-communism, are the crux of adjusting diplomatic relations. However, if both sides can find a path within a wider scope, it may not be difficult to reach a solution. (China United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations have entered a silent phase because Suma has returned to report, and Japanese telegrams transmit that he carries new instructions from the Foreign Ministry determined by a three-ministry conference.

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Poncet, Secretary of the French Embassy in Tokyo, on the order of French Ambassador Charles-Arsène Henry, visited Mr. Amau, spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry today and denied recent reports from Shanghai in Japanese newspapers regarding France's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese negotiations. According to the reports, French Ambassador to China, Naggiar, recently spoke with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, implying that if Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism is aimed at dealing with Soviet Russia, the scope of implementation of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement will not be limited to Europe, but will also extend to the Far East. Poncet also denied that Ambassador Naggiar had been secretly working with Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, to obstruct the progress of the Nanjing Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that this information was pure fabrication. Ambassador Naggiar has never expressed that the French government holds this attitude. Ambassador Naggiar has not met with Ambassador Kawagoe recently, and the French government has repeatedly officially announced that the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement is limited to Europe. As for the claim that Ambassador Naggiar is secretly working to obstruct the progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, it is completely untrue. Such rumors are sufficient to cause misunderstandings among the Japanese people, and he hopes that the Japanese government will correct them. Mr. Amau replied that Japan firmly believes in the declaration that the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement is limited to Europe, and he does not believe the rumors that Western ambassadors are currently engaged in secret activities regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. This is because Sino-Japanese negotiations should only be handled by China and Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

According to him, the autumn harvest has been reaped this year, and all localities have reported bumper harvests. According to custom, grain prices should fall. However, grain prices have suddenly risen in various places in the past month, initially limited to flour and wheat, but now rice and grain have also increased accordingly. Various sectors of society have appealed to the government, requesting a ban on grain exports to maintain price stability. Recently, Jiangsu Province has already implemented a ban on grain exports. The grain problem seems to be becoming increasingly serious. Examining the continuous rise in grain prices at present, there are two main reasons: the development of agricultural storage businesses in various provinces, with a large amount of storage, and banks also investing in rural areas to provide grain mortgage loans, absorbing a lot of grain. This is one reason. Farmers in various places are hoarding due to the bumper harvest, waiting for higher prices to sell the surplus grain. Other people are also hoarding grain due to the prolonged drought, planning reserves. This is the second reason. Due to the above two reasons, the supply of grain on the market cannot meet the demand, resulting in a continuous rise in prices. In addition, wheat-producing countries around the world have all experienced poor harvests this year, leading to a sharp decline in imports. Some people are actively sending personnel to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River to buy large quantities of grain, and unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate and hoard, which is another reason for the continuous rise in grain prices. Minister Kong has been closely monitoring the development of this issue for a long time. I, Gao Bingfang, as the Director of the Tax Department, am in charge of this matter under orders, and I am also very concerned about the planning and coordination work. All grain purchase, storage, and transportation matters are now being handled by Wang Baolun, Chen Zhensheng, Xi Yan, Zhao Shifu, and others appointed by the Central Bank. Chen has gone to Wuwei, and Xi has gone to Ganzhou, starting with investigating market prices and carefully seeking stabilization measures. Once there is a surplus of grain on the market, the local branches of the Central Bank will purchase it to meet the need for grain regulation. In the future, depending on the development of the business, the Ministry may establish a grain management agency to take on the responsibility, so that grain prices will not rise or fall excessively, and the public will not feel panic about food. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because of the soaring grain prices, various parties have requested a ban on grain exports. The Ministry of Finance has scheduled a meeting of relevant agencies such as the Ministries of Industry, Interior, Railways, Communications, and the Customs Administration within the next few days to discuss measures, so as to decide on measures to ban exports on the one hand and measures for transportation and sales on the other hand, to stabilize rice prices and regulate public food supply. The Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Interior will jointly establish a management agency to be specifically responsible for this matter. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">British Sailor Insult Incident: British Government Protests to Japan; Demands Compensation for Losses; Commander of the British Fleet in China Suspends Visit to Japan <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government has notified the Japanese government, demanding compensation for the accidental incident that occurred recently in Keelung, Taiwan, because several sailors from the British submarine supply ship "Medway" were abused by Japanese police. After this incident, Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has decided to postpone the original plan to visit Japanese territorial waters. Little is currently cruising in Chinese territorial waters and was scheduled to arrive in Japan on the 30th aboard the British ship "Berwick." The following is an excerpt from the British official statement issued yesterday:</p>
<p>"On October 7, an accidental incident occurred in Keelung, Taiwan, in which three British sailors were abused by Japanese police. At the time, there was a dispute over the payment of streetcar fares. However, the British side has clear evidence to prove that the fare had been paid. As a result of the argument, the three British sailors were taken to the police station. Unexpectedly, they were all injured during detention, one of whom had his jaw broken. At that time, a British naval officer stepped in to intervene and was also insulted by the Japanese police. The British government has now notified the Japanese side, demanding appropriate compensation for this accidental incident. At the same time, the official visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China to various Japanese ports must also be temporarily cancelled."</p>
<p>It is rumored that the British sailors were arrested for filming Keelung Fortress, which is a misunderstanding. It is said that several days before this incident, a British officer was falsely accused by Japanese police of taking photos of the fortress. In fact, this officer was taking photos of the submarines docked on either side of the "Medway" warship. Unexpectedly, he accidentally included part of the coastline in the photo, which led to the false accusation. Currently, the "Medway" is stationed in Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, someone inquired with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the fact that Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has postponed his visit to Japan aboard the cruiser "Berwick," and the reasons for it. According to the answer, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs knows nothing about it. The British Embassy in Japan only announced the news that Vice Admiral Little has postponed his visit to Japan and does not want to comment on this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Dawn of the French People's Government <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Recently, all aspects of the European political situation have been developing in ways that are worth our deep attention. The significant impact caused by the Italo-German conference and the nominal existence of the Spanish non-intervention agreement goes without saying. Even the recovery of the French People's Government is of great relevance to European peace and provides us with a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>The French People's Front, since its organization after the February 6th fascist riots last year, achieved an unprecedented victory in the parliamentary elections this May and formed the People's Government. The emergence of the French People's Government is not only a strong defense of the republican system but also an important guarantee for European and even international peace. However, less than half a year after the People's Government took office, a major rift occurred within it, almost shaking the entire foundation. Why did this rift occur within the People's Front? To answer this question, we must first understand the composition and purpose of the People's Front. The French People's Front consists of three left-wing parties: the Radical Socialist Party, the Orthodox Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. Their political programs are different. The reason they were able to form a common front was that the power of the fascists was very great at that time. The great riot of February 6th almost completely overturned the republican system that countless people had shed blood to obtain. Therefore, the left-wing parties united to form the People's Front, concentrating their strength to defend the republican system and resist the fascist regime. Therefore, Premier Blum said it well: "The fascist groups are indeed the parents of the People's Front."</p>
<p>Because of its concentrated and united strength, the People's Front was able to form the People's Government after winning the election in May of this year. However, although they have a common political program, because the interests represented by each party are ultimately different, some rifts are inevitable. In particular, the mass strikes and factory occupations by oppressed workers in various places after the election victory aroused dissatisfaction among the Radical Socialist Party, which represented the interests of the middle class. At that time, because the People's Government held power and the forces of reactionaries were still very high, the internal disputes did not immediately erupt. However, recently, because the People's Government's administration was appropriate, the power of the fascists had slightly decreased. Thus, this rift gradually expanded. The right-wing elements of the Radical Socialist Party were determined to exclude the Communist Party from the People's Front. On the eve of the Radical Socialist Party Congress in Biarritz, the situation seemed very critical. However, in the end, due to the overall interests of all parties, especially the Communist Party's concessions (such as expressing the maintenance of order and respect for private property), the Radical Socialist Party still decided to participate in the People's Front. Thus, the foundation of the People's Government was once again stabilized.</p>
<p>The consolidation of the foundation of the French People's Government not only prevents the forces of reactionaries from rising at home and ensures the republican system but also increases the strength of the collective security system internationally and deals a major blow to the aggression front because the French People's Government adopts a peaceful foreign policy.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Fascist Group's Power Rises Daily, Soviet Union Prepares for Self-Defense, European Situation Changes, External Support Unreliable, Expand Armaments to Prevent Japanese-German Invasion <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(London) Due to the Spanish civil war and the increasingly large fascist group in Europe, the Soviet Union's international position has been greatly weakened. Therefore, it is now preparing a self-defense plan so that it can resist without external support. Soviet military experts believe that the most indispensable thing is an air force capable of resisting simultaneous attacks by Japan and Germany. The distance between the eastern and western borders of the Soviet Union is too great, and transportation is inconvenient, so both sides must pay attention. However, Soviet spokespersons here firmly assert that the Soviet Union's purpose is purely self-defense and that it is only focused on developing its vast natural resources. Now, France can no longer assist the Soviet Union based on the Franco-Soviet alliance. Since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty and re-established armaments in the Rhineland, France has been unable to cope. Recently, the King of Belgium restored the neutral policy before the European war, so that France can no longer send troops through Belgian territory. It is said that the Little Entente also intends to follow Belgium's example, especially Romania and Yugoslavia. Britain has always been very indifferent to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and has recently become more opposed to it because Germany insists that if it wants to re-sign the Locarno Treaty, it must guarantee that the Soviet Union is not allowed to participate, and its proposal has been successful. Observers believe that Britain's recent attitude in the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee is most noteworthy, that is, the representatives of neutral countries saw the committee chairman, Sir Plymouth, accept Germany's reply to the Soviet Union's protest as "satisfactory," and were also surprised.

<p>(Paris) During yesterday afternoon's cabinet meeting, the Spanish issue was submitted for research. A unanimous resolution was made to continue the non-intervention policy. Subsequently, Cabinet Assistant and Minister of National Defense Daladier declared that the law on the nationalization of various factories in the defense industry would be implemented within days. Finance Minister Olivari immediately submitted the 1937 budget, with total expenditure of 42,000,000,000 francs, not including defense expenditures. After offsetting the large income and expenditure, the deficit will reach 15,000,000,000 francs. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense will submit a new plan to replenish the northern border defense, which will inevitably involve a huge expenditure. Today's cabinet meeting also discussed the provincial fiscal reform plan, and it was decided that certain expenditures of the provincial governments, such as air defense expenditures, should be borne by the central government. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources recently claimed that State Councillor and Minister of National Defense Daladier will soon travel to the northern border area with General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff, to inspect defense affairs and study various national defense measures. Regarding this matter, the Morning Post reported, "The government is about to ask Congress to increase national defense expenditures to build fortifications on the northern border. Since the King of Belgium announced a neutral policy, it is necessary to organize border defense there." (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Belgian Capital The parliament held a temporary meeting today to discuss the army reform plan.

Political figures believe that the Socialist Party now also recognizes the need to strengthen national defense, so the army reform plan can be passed by a large majority vote.

<p>(Rome) Today is the 14th anniversary of the Fascist Party's "March on" Rome and the first anniversary of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and the establishment of the African Empire. Celebrations are held throughout the country, which are more lively than in previous years. In the capital, representatives from Fascist Party departments across the country have come to participate and have sent their party flags to the capital for display. This is also the first such ceremony in fourteen years. In addition, the government has engraved a commemorative map of Italian overseas colonies in 1936 on the marble wall of the "Imperial Avenue," ranking it among the four maps of the Roman Empire. Its importance is evident. The unveiling ceremony of this stone-carved commemorative map was held this morning and was personally presided over by Mussolini. At 11:00 AM, representatives of Fascist Party members from various places, holding flags, gathered in Venice Square (in front of the Prime Minister's Office). Representatives from overseas branches also participated in uniform. The Prime Minister gave a speech saying that the fifteenth year of the Fascist era has begun today, and it is expected that this year's achievements will be on par with the past year, "because our beliefs and aspirations are as sharp and tenacious as the steel of our bayonets, and we will overcome any obstacles."

<p>The News reported on October 18th that Chinese medical scientist Tao Chishun advocated "Chinese Health Statistics," saying that in the last century, China's population has increased very slowly, and that is because the world is becoming more and more complex, requiring too much brain power and physical exertion. If you don't use your brain and exert yourself, you can't survive, so you have to work hard, which affects physical weakness and illness, premature aging, and early death. How can the population increase dramatically? How can the body be strong? The only way to remedy this is through exercise and nourishment.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the assassination of Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai in Hankou, his body was moved to the Bankers' Association. The entire Provincial Government Committee held an emergency meeting that evening and appointed Lu Zhu, a member of the Provincial Committee and Secretary-General, as acting chairman and reported it to the Central Government for record. On the 26th, a public notice was issued to all sectors, and the Provincial Government and all departments continued to operate as usual. However, the regular meeting on that day was suspended to express mourning. Yang's body was originally scheduled to be placed in a coffin on the 26th, but it was postponed by one day because his eldest daughter, Ms. Yixi, had not yet arrived. Many people from all walks of life went to the mourning hall to pay their respects. A telegram of condolence from the Central Executive Committee has also arrived in Hubei. Military and political dignitaries and consuls from various countries in Hankou have also sent telegrams of condolence, totaling more than a thousand. The funeral preparatory office held a meeting at the Bankers' Association on the 26th and resolved nine points: (1) A small coffin will be placed at 3:00 AM on the 27th. After Chairman Yang's family arrives, a large coffin will be placed; (2) The coffin will be moved to the newly built library in Baobingtang, Wuchang, on a scheduled date; (3) The funeral committee will move to the Provincial Government office after the coffin is moved to Wuchang; (4) The memorial service will be held in the Provincial Government; (5) On the day of the coffin's movement and the memorial service, all of Hubei Province will fly flags at half-mast to express mourning; (6) The funeral committee will be officially established on the same day, and the name of the preparatory office will be abolished; (7) He Chengjun is appointed as the director of the funeral committee, and Chen Jicheng and Lu Zhu are appointed as deputy directors; (8) A ceremony group will be added to the funeral committee, and Li Shucheng will be appointed as the chief clerk; (9) Chen Fang is appointed as the chief clerk of the document group, Deng Xiangyu and Yu Huanzheng are appointed as deputy chief clerks, Cheng Qibao is appointed as the chief clerk of the reception group, Jia Shiyi is appointed as the chief clerk of the accounting group, Nan Kui and Zhou Qian are appointed as deputy chief clerks, Meng Guangpeng is appointed as the chief clerk of the general affairs group, Xing Yaoshen, Jia Baosan, and Cheng Wenxun are appointed as deputy chief clerks, Liu Shoupeng is appointed as the chief clerk of the arrangement group, He Hengfu, Jin Jutang, and Hong Yanbin are appointed as deputy chief clerks, Liu Zushun is appointed as the chief clerk of the security group, Cai Mengjian and Wang Yufen are appointed as deputy chief clerks, Li Shucheng is appointed as the chief clerk of the ceremony group, and Yi Jueqian and Ye Jialong are appointed as deputy chief clerks. The decision was immediately announced to all parties to start work. The incident was very sudden. According to eyewitnesses, at about 1:00 PM on the 25th, a person was wandering on a wharf along the riverbank, sitting on a bench on the sidewalk. When he saw a car arrive, he immediately stood up. It was said that he had been waiting for Yang for two hours. At 3:15 PM, Yang's car arrived at a wharf. After getting out of the car and stepping onto the stone steps, the murderer rushed forward, pulled out a gun, and shot. After Yang was shot, his guards chased after the murderer and fired six shots, but missed. The ammunition was exhausted. The murderer dropped his pistol while fleeing. He turned back to pick it up, but the police on duty arrived and stopped him. The police in front came out to intercept him and finally captured him. The crowd beat him up, but the murderer remained calm and stopped them from beating him, saying, "I am not an ignorant person. I can go with you." Later, after strict interrogation, he confessed his name as Cheng Xiechao and admitted to assassinating Yang, claiming that he had been in Hankou for a long time and had lived in the Taian Inn on He Street. He moved to the Jinghan Hotel on the 18th. The military and political authorities decided that the case would be tried by a special military court jointly formed by the Pacification Headquarters, the Garrison Command, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Gendarmerie Corps. It is believed that some clues can be obtained from this. As for the five suspects arrested at the Jinghan Hotel, they were jointly tried by the Investigation Division and the Gendarmerie Corps at the police station on the 26th. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were not related to the case, and they were all released on bail. (October 26th)</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Yang Yongtai was assassinated in front of the Jianghan Customs House in Hankou the other day. This is the first time since 1926 that a high-ranking official has been killed by thugs. Chairman Lin of the National Government and President Jiang of the Executive Yuan have sent telegrams of condolence to his family. Central Party, government, and military institutions have also sent Liu Bohua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, to Hubei to offer condolences. Liu arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 12:00 noon on the 27th and arrived at 2:40 PM. Yang's eldest daughter, Ms. Yixi, third daughter, Ms. Qiuxi, fourth daughter, Ms. Yanxi, and fifth daughter, Ms. Chenxi, also arrived by China Aviation Corporation plane from Shanghai. At that time, Yang's body had already been placed in a small coffin at 3:00 AM. They wept bitterly over the coffin, and the scene was extremely tragic. However, his wife, Ms. Li Wuzhen, remained in Shanghai due to illness. His second daughter is studying in England, and although a telegram has been sent to notify her, it is feared that she will not be able to return to China. His sixth daughter, Ms. Xi, and son, Huaixi, were with Yang in Hubei. The funeral committee, considering that Yang's family had arrived, placed Yang's body in a large coffin at 6:00 PM and held a public memorial service, presided over by Liu Zhenhua, He Chengjun, and Lu Zhu.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, the Central Government Representative, wrote in his eulogy: "On this 28th day of October in the 25th year of the Republic of China, the day of the great coffin placement of the late Chairman Yang Changqing of the Hubei Provincial Government, Zhenhua, on behalf of the Central Government, came by plane to offer sacrifices with wine, flowers, and incense to the spirit of my brother Changqing. Zhenhua was in Nanjing when he suddenly heard the news of the misfortune. My heart was broken, and I could not eat or sleep in peace. Therefore, despite my weak health, I chartered a plane to Hubei, wanting to see my old friend one last time before the coffin was closed. Now, his face is still the same, but his voice and appearance are gone. Where should these tears of grief come from? Zhenhua's grief is not the private grief of one person. It is because my brother's body was a pillar of the country, an arm of Chairman Jiang. Now that my brother is dead, the country has lost a pillar, and Chairman Jiang has lost an arm. How can the loss be measured? Therefore, today's crying is not Zhenhua's crying for his brother, but the crying of all those who are heartbroken throughout the country. I still remember our casual conversations, and my brother often said with emotion that we should follow Chairman Jiang's efforts to rebuild the country and the nation, so that we can also be virtuous assistants of the Zhongxing. How could I have thought that my brother would not fulfill his ambition, would not see the Zhongxing of the country, and would leave us to die first? However, my brother's ambition is also our ambition. From now on, we can only follow Chairman Jiang and redouble our efforts to complete the cause of national revival to comfort my brother's spirit in heaven. What is most unbearable is that my brother died suddenly with a heart full of patriotic enthusiasm, and without leaving a single word of his will. With my brother's noble character, like the Chengdu mulberry and the Hunan orange, combined with a weak wife and young children, he left without looking back. This is truly something that makes my heart break every time I think about it. However, the unfinished business of my brother today is the responsibility of those who survive him. Moreover, my brother is very smart and will surely have achievements in the future, and will be able to continue my brother's legacy. Let my brother be comforted in the afterlife. This is something that can be foreseen by heaven and humanity. It is so sad, so painful, Chang brother, Chang brother, do you know my sorrow? Enjoy the sacrifice."</p>
<p>He Chengjun and representatives of Party, government, military, police, and other organizations wrote in their eulogy: "On this 27th day of October in the 25th year of the Republic of China, He Chengjun, Special Envoy of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stationed in Hubei and Pacification Director, led representatives of Party, government, military, police, and other organizations to offer sacrifices to the spirit of the late Chairman Yang of the Hubei Provincial Government, saying, 'Looking back at our public, containing plans and expressing loyalty, presiding over the Altar, discussing with breadth and depth, controlling financial power, taking on heavy responsibilities, achieving merit in our hometown, and being respected in Guangzhou. When assisting Yuanrong, serving in three provinces, planning in the tent, deciding victories and predicting enemies, We were bestowed with trust and appointed to the border region, rejuvenating Jianghan, praising the customs of Jianghan, Zhou official six lines, Guanzi four dimensions, clarifying the essentials, advocating grand rules. Given time, we hoped for great governance. How could we have imagined that we would be ambushed and that the virtuous would suddenly pass away? The shocking news spread, and we shared the same boat through storms, sharing worries and dangers. Since we have entrusted our sincere friendship, we feel even more grief. White horses and plain cars mourn at the mourning hall, pouring wine into the cup, and offering sumptuous dishes. May the gods come and be on our side. Alas, enjoy the sacrifice.'"</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Government wrote in its eulogy: "On this 27th day of October in the 25th year of the Republic of China, Lu Zhu and other members of the Hubei Provincial Government and officials of all subordinate agencies respectfully offer sacrifices to the spirit of the late Chairman Yang, saying, 'Oh, our public, with extraordinary talent, early participation in the National Assembly, upright words and eloquence, opening the mansion in Guangdong, grand facilities, assisting Yuanrong, meritorious deeds in the tent, going out to suppress Hubei, nourishing Jianghan, bearing heavy burdens and reaching far, adhering to the three lines, working diligently day and night, governing and planning, and all measures were taken. It has already taken shape, Yiyang Zhibiao, Nampithe similar, recorded in the history books, demonstrating political transformation. Alas, my colleagues, fortunately relying on leadership, inspiring our spirit, and hoping for great achievements. Unfortunately, Wu Tian did not pity us, and we were suddenly ambushed. With a single gaze of composure, alas, our Uncle, the Nanguo Gan Tang, always cherishes the fear of Zhao, the Chu xie soars, and the Jiuquan does not work, alas, enjoy the sacrifice."</p>
<p>Yang's coffin has now been decided by the funeral committee to be moved to the newly built Provincial Library in Baobingtang, Wuchang, on the 2nd of next month, and a memorial service will be held at a later date. After Yang's death, the entire Provincial Government Committee, in order to ensure that government affairs are not interrupted, appointed Lu Zhu, a member of the committee and Secretary-General, to temporarily act as chairman and take temporary responsibility. At the same time, they telegraphed President Jiang to send someone to preside over the matter. It is reported that Jiang has already telegraphed Hubei, instructing Meng Guangpeng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to temporarily act as chairman. As for the criminal Cheng Xiechao, who was stabbed, after several strict interrogations, his confession is still flickering. He was transferred to the Army Prison on the 27th to await a joint trial by a special military court formed by various agencies. It is said that he will be transferred to the Central Government for questioning. Of the suspects arrested, five were released on bail on the 26th, but it is reported that several others have been arrested and are still being detained awaiting interrogation. (October 27th)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In Shishi and the coastal area outside the South Gate of Quanzhou, certain figures have been very active recently. A few days ago, in the Linkou Township area, a number of Taiwanese suddenly appeared, disguised as street performers doing magic tricks and selling plaster. They went deep into the countryside, acting strangely. They carried two cloth-made dragon flags with the words "National Salvation Corps" written on them. They beat drums and gongs to attract ordinary villagers and engaged in extensive propaganda. They first started by talking about Zheng Chenggong's resistance against the Qing Dynasty in Taiwan, and then praised Japan's wealth and strength, and finally talked about the necessity of cooperation between China and Japan. They traveled around various villages and made the same arguments everywhere, while the business of selling plaster seemed insignificant. Moreover, although Shishi is an important commercial and transportation hub in southern Fujian, it is by no means a scenic spot. Four foreigners (including one woman) who did not carry passports also traveled to Shishi and the surrounding villages the other day. Among them, there were those who could speak the Southern Min dialect and specialized in questioning ignorant villagers about the local situation and writing it down in books. It can be said that they must have a purpose. (October 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the Border Area of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui Moves to Quzhou; All Sectors in Jiangshan Hold a Grand Farewell Party; Zhang Fakui Delivers a Reply, Encouraging Efforts in Construction <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Jiangshan Correspondence: Since the headquarters of the General Commander for the Suppression of Bandits in the border area of the four provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been stationed in Jiangshan, eight months have passed in an instant. During this period, General Commander Zhang Fakui, in addition to earnestly engaging in the suppression of remnant bandits, has also actively promoted and spared no effort in all local construction. The most prominent achievements include the implementation of compulsory literacy education for the masses, the construction of Zhongshan and Zhongzheng Avenues, and the rigorous implementation of the New Life Movement, which has transformed the old Jiangshan, which was filled with apathy, into a new Jiangshan full of vitality. Recently, in order to facilitate the command and suppression of bandits, the headquarters moved to Quzhou. The local people of this county, having heard the news beforehand, tried unsuccessfully to persuade them to stay. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on the 26th of the month, the "Jiangshan All Sectors Farewell General Commander Zhang's Departure to Sanqu Farewell Commemorative Meeting" was held at the Public Gymnasium in the city to express their thoughts. On that day, more than a hundred groups from Party, government, military, agriculture, industry, commerce, and education, and more than ten thousand people participated. General Commander Zhang and all the officers and soldiers of the headquarters arrived on time. The military band played loudly. First, the presidium and representatives of various groups delivered speeches, unanimously praising General Commander Zhang's efforts in suppressing bandits, his strict discipline in governing the army, and his enthusiasm for construction over the past eight months, expressing their intention not to forget his prestige. Then, they presented embroidered flags with the words "Guardian of the Country," "Meritorious Deeds in the Party-State," "Guaranteeing the Southeast," and "Benefiting the People of Jiang" to commemorate him. Then, General Commander Zhang delivered a reply, saying that in the past eight months, he had asked himself whether he had made many contributions to the Party-State and the local area. However, he was so warmly welcomed by the elders of all sectors in Jiangshan, which he did not dare to take. Now, based on the meaning of the ancient farewell remarks, he hoped that the Jiangshan compatriots would unite in spirit, cooperate with each other, and build a new Jiangshan as the foundation for the future revival of the Chinese nation. His words were very alert, and the whole scene was moved. Finally, all the people formed a team to go to the bus station outside the South Gate to see him off, and set off firecrackers all the way. The situation was extremely warm.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Jiangsu Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits the Private Export of Foodstuffs; Sea Transport Requires Passports; County Governments Responsible for Inspection <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the beginning of autumn, although Jiangsu Province has had a bumper harvest of food crops, prices have soared. It is believed that the main reasons are the private export of food by grain merchants and hoarding for profit. Ordinary people are suffering immensely. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially formulated the "Provisional Measures for Strictly Prohibiting the Export of Foodstuffs from Jiangsu Province," which was passed at the Provincial Government meeting on the 27th. The details are recorded as follows: (1) These provisional measures are specially formulated in order to maintain the people's food supply in this province. (2) Foodstuffs from various counties in this province are allowed to circulate freely, except for transportation that requires a passport for sea transport. The aforementioned passports shall be issued by the county government where the business firm purchasing the foodstuffs is located. No fees shall be charged for passports. (3) If other provinces or cities report a need and are approved by the provincial government for assistance, the provincial government shall issue a passport for the grain to leave the province. The county government at the place of exit shall verify the compliance before allowing it to pass; otherwise, it will be considered private export. (4) County governments of counties along the Yangtze River, along the coast, and bordering neighboring provinces are responsible for inspecting foodstuffs leaving the territory. However, they must not deliberately create difficulties, extort money, or engage in favoritism. Violations will result in severe punishment for the responsible officials and strict legal action against all other personnel involved. (5) Anyone who encounters food from this province being privately transported out to sea at various ports along the Yangtze River and along the coast can report it to the local government or maritime customs office to intercept it. (6) If a rice merchant is found to be privately exporting foodstuffs to sea, in addition to confiscating the foodstuffs, they will also be ordered to suspend their business operations. (7) For foodstuffs seized during private exports to sea or out of the province, if the quantity is below 50 shi, all shall be used as rewards; if it is between 50 shi and 100 shi, 50% shall be used as rewards, and the remaining 50% shall be transferred to the Food Management Committee for storage; if it is above 100 shi, one-quarter shall be used as rewards, and the remaining three-quarters shall be transferred to the Food Management Committee for storage. (8) The rewarded foodstuffs shall be distributed with 60% going to the informer and 40% to the local government or customs office that accepted the report and intercepted the goods. (9) If a person reports the private export of foodstuffs to sea or out of the province with malicious intent, they shall be severely punished according to the law once verified. (10) These provisional measures shall be implemented upon deliberation and promulgation by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>

<p>Recently, bandits have run rampant in the Suzhou countryside, and robberies are frequently heard. Farmers in the four villages cannot sleep peacefully. A few days ago, major robbery cases occurred in Zhouzhuang and other villages, and the authorities are strictly investigating. Unexpectedly, a boat sailing from Dongting Dongshan to Huzhou in Zhejiang Province encountered another bandit boat with more than ten bandits carrying weapons on the 27th while passing through Jueshan in Taihu Lake. All passengers on board were robbed, losing more than 500 yuan. The bandits fled to the lake area of Huzhou in Zhejiang Province. On the same day, robberies of boats also occurred near Dongshan, but the losses were minimal. The Second District Commissioner's Office convened a water and public security meeting of the eight counties on the 28th to discuss the Taihu Lake bandits. With the approach of winter prevention, it will join the Zhejiang Provincial water and land teams to conduct a large-scale encirclement and suppression to maintain security in the four villages.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Wuxi: The Surge in Cotton Yarn Prices Has Subsided <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The market price of cotton yarn in this city soared in the past week due to brisk sales. Recently, foreign cotton has not improved, and the price surge has subsided. Market sentiment has also become sluggish. Yesterday, the price of various brands of cotton yarn fell by several jiao to two yuan per piece. It is predicted that there is still a possibility of further price declines in the future market. Furthermore, it is learned that the market situation for rice and paddy in this city has also declined by about one jiao per dan due to a surge in arrivals and sluggish sales. Clear white japonica rice is priced at 9.2 yuan. However, some merchants are still shipping rice and grain abroad, and it is hoped that the authorities will stop this to maintain the people's food supply. It is reported that 200 rice boats were intercepted at the junction of Wuxi and Jiangyin a few days ago.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Establishment of a Health Office <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The county government of this city is planning to establish a county-wide health office, which County Magistrate Long is actively pursuing. The first preparatory meeting was convened yesterday and resolved the following: (1) It will have three sections: General Affairs, Architectural Design, and Construction. Li Shouxuan was appointed as the head of the General Affairs section, Zhang Fulin as the head of the Architectural Design section, and Wu Yifeng as the head of the Construction section. (2) There are currently two types of organizational systems for the Health Office. Mountain Consultant Weng Zhilong, Zai Yuanchen, and Committee Member Wu Yifeng will jointly discuss and review them. (3) The number of staff will be reviewed by the previous case review committee. (4) In addition to allocating 18,800 yuan specifically for equipment costs, the remaining funds will be used for construction costs. It is estimated that at least an additional 10,000 yuan will be needed to meet the needs, which will be submitted to the province for approval. (5) The establishment expenses for the Health Office and the County Hospital have been approved. The allocation ratio for each item will be reviewed by Consultants Weng and Wang, and Committee Member Wu. It was also decided to build the location near Deyuan Road in Ximen. Once the blueprint is finalized, bidding can be invited for construction.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a person in the Xixu town of this place suddenly died of crab poisoning. Zhao Meixuan from Yangshe went to Qian Yixing's southern goods store in Xushi the day before yesterday to collect payments. Because Mr. Qian and Mr. Zhao were old friends, Qian entertained Zhao with a large crab before dinner, and they ate it together. Unexpectedly, Zhao was already ill. Because he liked crabs very much, he ate four or five in a row. At the time, there was nothing unusual, but at midnight, he had severe abdominal pain and died at dawn. Therefore, Mr. Qian was greatly shocked and sent someone to quickly report to his family to collect the body.</p>

<p>Zhuang Liangxian, the head of the Xizhang Township, is 75 years old this year. He owns three to four thousand mu of fertile land and is the richest man in the entire township. Mr. Zhuang has married three wives, who have passed away one after another. He has two sons and two daughters, the oldest of whom is thirty years old and the youngest still a child. This spring, Mr. Zhuang, feeling lonely in his solitary residence, met Ms. Gui Yuejing, a female teacher at a certain school, who is 31 years old this year. Zhuang immediately asked someone to act as an intermediary and hired her as his next wife with 1,400 yuan in cash and 1,000 mu of fertile land. They were engaged in July, but unexpectedly, his eldest son and brother-in-law (former wife) opposed it and blocked its progress. Both parties sued in the county judiciary. Zhuang was once detained, causing the rice stored at home to be stolen and sold. The lawsuit is still ongoing. However, Mr. Zhuang's marriage is still his intention and continues to proceed. On the 27th, he held a wedding ceremony with Ms. Gui at his residence outside the East Gate. Lawyers Yu Chengmei and He Baoshu were hired to witness the marriage. White hair and a red face became a good story for a while. Later, according to the septuagenarian groom's public statement, "Although there is an age difference between my wife and me, there are no regulations in law." In other words, it is legal. "However, my marriage is not for the sake of succession. I already have children and grandchildren, so it is out of the question. However, in my own life, I have a companion." After he finished speaking, everyone laughed.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance's pilot Tong-Ru-Chong-Hai District Investigation Smuggling Intelligence Office was ineffective and had many drawbacks.

<p>The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau stated that the dikes on the east and west banks of the various counties along the canal are densely populated with shops and residents. According to the ban on building houses on the canal dikes, they should all be demolished. However, the method of gradually abolishing them was determined, but people still arbitrarily abused them, which greatly hindered the dike construction. It is urgent to strictly ban them. The county government of this county yesterday received an order to be responsible for protecting the dike works on the east and west banks of the towns along the canal. It is strictly forbidden for merchants and residents living in the towns along the dikes to damage the top and body of the dikes, dump garbage, or dig dike soil, resulting in the increasing incompleteness of the dike body and dike slope. After this prohibition, if the above situation occurs again, the township heads will report to the county to arrest and severely punish those responsible.</p>

<p>There are more than 50 hotels in this city. In the winter of 1932, the county government formulated rules for managing hotel operations and issued business licenses, which has been more than three years. The county government, in view of the imminent arrival of winter prevention and the extremely tense situation, believes that some unscrupulous hotels may harbor dirt and filth and easily allow bandits to hide and harm the local area. In order to maintain local stability, it has re-formulated management rules and exchanged business licenses. New ones cost two yuan each, plus five jiao for stamp duty; exchanges cost one yuan, plus five jiao for stamp duty. It has also issued a public announcement.</p>

<p>Although the autumn harvest of food crops in the coastal areas this year has been greatly reduced compared with previous years, it is still sufficient to supply the local people if there are no unscrupulous merchants manipulating purchases and exports. However, in recent months, a certain country has used unscrupulous merchants to purchase food in large quantities in various parts of the coastal areas, transporting it by rail and shipping it, amounting to thousands of bags a day, causing food prices to rise several times a day. Taking Song flour as an example, the value of each bag was only 3.4 yuan last month, but now it has risen to 4.05 yuan. The prices of other various foods have also risen by 30% to 40%. The general public is crying bitterly. In the blink of an eye, the severe winter of ice and snow will arrive. If the authorities do not find a way to ban exports, the food supply in the coastal areas will be even more unimaginable.</p>

<p>Zhang Kaibang, a resident of the Seventh Bao of Lugou Township, Lianyungang City, is over 30 years old and earns a living as a woodcutter. Because the firewood and grass in the nearby mountains have been almost exhausted, he discussed with his neighbor Cheng Sen and others to go to distant places to cut grass. Yesterday morning, at the time of the rooster crowing, Kaibang got up and entered the mountain. Cheng and others also followed him into the mountain. While Cheng and others were walking, they suddenly heard Kaibang calling for help in front of them and shouting "Snake!" Cheng and others rushed forward and saw a giant snake, about two zhang long, with blue scales, bright and dazzling. The snake's tail was wrapped around Kaibang's body. Seeing this, Cheng and others used shoulder poles and sickles to kill the snake and carried Kaibang to a nearby farmer's house. After washing his face with clean water, he was able to speak. According to experts, the snake is called a grass snake and does not bite. It has two whiskers. It coils around people, uses its whiskers to probe people's nostrils, and sucks their brains, causing them to die immediately. The whole snake weighed 96 jin. Farmers who heard the news came to watch in an endless stream.</p>

<h3 id="e88">This Year's Measures by the Ministry of Education to Subsidize Hardworking Students from the Northeast <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai social sector yesterday ordered public and private secondary schools and private colleges and universities, saying, "The Ministry of Education's Northeast Youth Education Relief Office's telegram stated that the office's subsidies for Northeast students in 1940 were previously reviewed and processed by sending the regulations, nomination forms, deadline for nominations, and notes. However, the Northeast students of all levels of schools have claimed that they did not understand the meaning of the free quota and public expense quota programs promulgated by the Ministry, mistakenly believing that applying for a certificate of poverty could obtain the subsidy from the office, resulting in a lack of nominations. It would be a pity if they lost the opportunity to receive a subsidy because of this. Please find a way to remedy it. Therefore, the office affairs meeting resolved: (1) The deadline for schools at all levels in all provinces and cities to nominate hardworking students from the Northeast is extended to the end of this year. Those who have sent the nomination documents to the office and declared that they will submit the missing documents are also limited to submit them before the end of October. No extensions will be granted to ensure the integrity of official duties. (2) In the future, if Northeast students in various schools apply for a certificate of poverty, the schools should first assess them. If it is confirmed that they are poor and have lived in a place for less than three years (those who have lived in a place for three years should apply to the local competent educational administrative agency), and the school has free and public expense quotas according to the regulations, the school will forward them to the office for verification. The office will no longer directly accept applications. Those who mistakenly believe that applying for a certificate of poverty can obtain the subsidy from the office should be explained by the schools to avoid misunderstandings. In addition to sending telegrams, this is hereby sent to you for your information and to inform all schools under your jurisdiction. This is a public friendship." Therefore, after reviewing the case, the city Education Bureau received the regulations and forms sent by the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education and ordered them to be followed. Now, according to the previous, it is ordered to be informed of this order.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Status of National Academic Institutions and Organizations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics on national academic institutions and organizations, which have increased year by year. Before the founding of the Republic of China, there were only five. From the first year of the Republic of China to the third year, there were six each year. In the fourth year, there were ten; in the fifth year, there were thirteen; in the sixth year, there were fourteen; from the first year of the Republic of China to the tenth year, there were seventeen each year; in the eleventh year, there were twenty-one; in the twelfth year, there were twenty-three; in the thirteenth year, there were twenty; in the fourteenth year, there were thirty; in the fifteenth year, there were thirty-seven; in the sixteenth year, there were forty-five; in the seventeenth year, there were fifty-four; in the sixteenth year, there were seventy; in the nineteenth year, there were eighty-six; in the twentieth year, there were ninety-six; in the twenty-first year, there were one hundred and thirteen; in the twenty-second year, there were one hundred and twenty-eight; and in the twenty-third year, there were one hundred and forty-four. Among them, there are 35 academic institutions and 109 academic organizations. Among these 109, there are 22 general categories, 7 sports categories, 34 practical categories (8 science, 4 agriculture and forestry, 10 engineering, 12 medicine), and 46 literature categories (8 literature and art, 22 social sciences, 16 education). The academic institutions and organizations are distributed as follows: 56 in the capital city, 36 in Shanghai, 14 in Beiping, ten in Jiangsu, six in Fujian, and three each in Guo and Jie. There are one each in Zhejiang, Hebei, Qing (Dao), Hunan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Sui, and one each in Anhui, Henan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Wei. According to their distribution, the capital city has the most, ranking first, Shanghai ranks second, and Beiping ranks third. Among the 35 major academic institutions in the country, such as the National Central Research Institute, the Beiping Research Institute, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry, all occupy important positions in the academic community. The remaining ones are newly established, provincial, or municipal. Their total annual expenditure is more than 4.6 million yuan, and their annual income is more than 4.48 million yuan (the annual income of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center is 480,000, and the annual expenditure is 550,000; the annual income of the Central Guoshu Hall is 60,000, and the annual expenditure is 70,000; the annual income of the Forensic Medical Institute is 3,000, and the annual expenditure is 66,000, all of which are insufficient to cover expenses). The equipment status is mainly divided into instruments, specimens, books, medicines, and special equipment. The personnel are divided into staff and researchers, full-time staff of more than 260, full-time researchers of more than 250, part-time staff of more than 140, part-time researchers of more than 180, staff of more than 550 who are not divided into part-time, and researchers of more than 509. A total of 262 research projects have been completed, and 331 are still in progress. A total of 507 publications have been published, including 128 series, 27 periodicals, and 352 other reports and special publications. The national academic and health organizations total 109, with an annual income of more than 786,000 yuan and an annual expenditure of 769,000 yuan. There are more than 2,700 staff members and 52,900 members, including more than 1,780 new members. There are more than 980 publications, totaling 3,399, including 84 periodicals and 501 other magazines, reports, and special publications. The increase in academic institutions and organizations over the years has been most vigorous since the establishment of the National Government in 1927, which can be called the most prosperous era in the 20 years since the founding of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Qinghai Students Come to Shanghai to Study <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Twelve arrived here yesterday</p>
<p>Qinghai is located in a remote area with blocked transportation. There are almost no students studying in Shanghai. Chen Hecen, Liu Zhanen, Shu Xincheng, He Qingxu, and other members of the Frontier Education Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Education Society are concerned about this. They worked with the New Qinghai Society to find ways for Qinghai youths to study in practice to prepare for the development of the frontier. The New Qinghai Society specially sent Zhang Deshan, director of the editorial department, to Shanghai to contact Chen, Liu, Shu, and others. As a result, eleven Qinghai students were recruited and subsidized for food and accommodation to study in Shanghai. The Qinghai Provincial Education Association and the New Qinghai Society jointly undertook the recruitment. A total of eleven students were recruited and arrived in Beijing at 8:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month. They took a train to Shanghai at 12:25 p.m. on the 27th, led by Zhang Deshan, director of the editorial department of the New Qinghai Society. They arrived here at 9:00 p.m. that afternoon. The Shanghai Society reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang to inquire about the details.</p>
<p>Recruitment Process</p>
<p>For the sake of prudence in this recruitment, Yang Xiyao and Gu Huaifeng of the Qinghai Provincial Education Association and Deng Qinyi and Ma Zunwei of the New Qinghai Society agreed on the recruitment method on August 20. They immediately posted recruitment advertisements, underwent written tests and physical examinations, and completed the process on August 28, enrolling twelve students.</p>
<p>Route</p>
<p>The students were all going out for the first time and were not familiar with transportation. Led by Ma Lingwei, director of the General Affairs Department of the New Qinghai Society, they set off from Xining on September 5 and arrived in Lanzhou on the 10th. Unfortunately, the Red bandits blocked the road, and the Xilan Road was blocked. After waiting until the 17th, they decided to take rafts along the Yellow River on the 27th. After passing through the Sangye Gorge, Boiling Man Pot, Dazhaobi, Xiaozhaobi, Yin and Yang , and other dangerous places, they traveled by water for ten days and arrived in Ningxia on October 10. There was a tense suppression of bandits in Ningxia. After waiting for four days, they took a boat on October 16 and traveled day and night, arriving in Baotou on the 18th. They took a car to Ban at 5:00 p.m. that evening. Due to the hardship of the journey, they rested for three days and took the Pingpu car at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th, arriving in Beijing on the 26th. This time, they received a lot of help from Acting Chairman Ma Bufang, Director Yang Xiyao, Gansu Pacification Director Zhu Yimin, and Chief Li Shijun of the 29th Army, making the journey much easier. They arrived in Shanghai by car at 12:25 p.m. today. Although the students have been through a long journey, they are all in good spirits and there were no accidents along the way.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhang said that the Qinghai students were warmly welcomed in Shanghai during the 6th National Games last year, and their spirits were greatly lifted. Many are willing to come to Shanghai to learn applied science and plan to build the frontier. This decision has also been promoted by the educational circles in Shanghai, which is deeply appreciated. Qinghai is located in the remote northwest and is an important strategic location for national defense. Therefore, the responsibility of Qinghai youths is great. I hope that people from all walks of life in Shanghai will provide more assistance so that aspiring youths can have the opportunity to study and develop their abilities, and the entire Qinghai people will benefit greatly. In addition, it was originally planned to recruit two female students to study midwifery, but unfortunately, the older female students in Qinghai cannot leave their environment, and the younger ones are inconvenient to manage, and their families are not at ease. Therefore, they could not be recruited. However, there are many who are willing to come to Shanghai to study, so we have to wait for the future. The list of students is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e93">General Education Overview (1) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>(Lecture at the Employment Guidance Class for Colleges and Above)</p>
<p>Hello everyone, today I will be talking to you about the current state of education in our country, which I will divide into four parts: (1) the state of elementary education nationwide, (2) the state of secondary education nationwide, (3) the state of higher education nationwide, and (4) the state of social education nationwide.</p>
<p>(1) The State of Elementary Education Nationwide Elementary education is the lowest level of education in the educational system. Elementary institutions can be roughly divided into two types: "kindergartens" and "primary schools."</p>
<p>Kindergartens are for children who have not yet reached the age of primary school enrollment, that is, children aged four to six, and provide them with education. The most important purpose of establishing kindergartens is to use various games and activities to teach young children, based on their natural inclination to move and love being in groups, to strengthen their bodies, exercise their senses, and increase their ability to observe and organize. This is a common need for all young children, especially for mothers who are busy with work and have no time to take care of their children, or for families that lack the knowledge and experience to care for young children. It would be more appropriate to send the young children to kindergartens. The number of kindergartens in our country is very small. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there were a total of 1,097 kindergartens nationwide, with only 47,512 children. Although there has been progress in each year, the gap with actual needs is still very large. Among these 40,000+ children, boys account for about 57.7%, and girls account for about 43.3%. The male to female ratio is very close. Equal educational opportunities for men and women in our country can only be勉强talked about in kindergartens. The rest of the general primary, secondary schools, and universities are not as good. In terms of preschool education, this is a somewhat comforting thing.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about primary schools. Primary schools are the place where compulsory national education is implemented. The duration of study is six years. The first four years are junior primary school, and the last two years are senior primary school. Junior primary schools can be established independently. Before education is universalized, junior primary school is the minimum compulsory education that citizens should receive. All children who are six years old must enter junior primary school. In special circumstances, they may be extended to nine years old. According to regulations, primary schools should not charge tuition fees in principle. In situations where local areas have no choice, they may also collect fees as appropriate. In public primary schools, the maximum fee per person per semester should not exceed one yuan for junior grades and two yuan for senior grades. In private primary schools, the maximum fee per person per semester should not exceed three yuan for junior grades and six yuan for senior grades. Primary schools that charge tuition fees should have one-third or more of their student body enrolled as poor children who receive free tuition. If a student cannot afford to pay tuition, the primary school principal should consider the situation and waive part or all of the tuition.</p>
<p>The length of compulsory education varies from country to country. For example, it is six years in Japan, seven years or more in the United States, eight years in Germany, France, and Belgium, and nine years or more in the United Kingdom, while it is only four years in our country. Even with these short four years, many children cannot attend school because of poverty. Even if they have enrolled, they still cannot finish their education. Therefore, in order to promote the popularization of compulsory education, the Ministry of Education has, on the one hand, urged local areas to widely establish the aforementioned senior and junior primary schools, and on the other hand, stipulated that local areas may establish simplified primary schools and short-term primary schools to provide assistance. Each province and city should handle various types of primary schools according to local conditions, and people are free to choose a suitable primary school and enroll their children, so that all citizens can receive the minimum compulsory education. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there were a total of 257,998 primary schools nationwide, including 208,009 junior primary schools, 22,319 primary schools that jointly operate both junior and senior grades, 4,044 simplified primary schools, 2,603 short-term primary schools, and 623 other types of schools. There were a total of 12,335,967 primary school students, including 11,083,253 junior primary school students, 1,066,955 senior primary school students, 82,180 simplified primary school students, 84,511 short-term primary school students, and 19,068 other students. There are about 27 primary school students for every thousand people. The children receiving compulsory education actually account for less than 25% of school-age children, which is much lower than the advanced countries where education has been popularized. It is also inferior to modern emerging countries such as Poland, Turkey, and Soviet Russia, because the number of children enrolled in their schools has generally reached more than 90% of school-age children.</p>
<p>In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Ministry of Education, in accordance with the Fourth Central Executive Committee's Fifth Plenary Session's plan to implement compulsory education, both as a stopgap measure and a fundamental solution, formulated a ten-year plan for compulsory education, namely the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education, which was announced last year. Its implementation procedure is divided into three phases:</p>
<p>The first phase is from August of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) to July of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). In addition to expanding existing primary schools, a large number of one-year short-term primary schools will be established. In the last year of this phase, namely the 29th year of the Republic (1940), at least 80% of school-age children nationwide should receive at least one year of short-term primary school education. The second phase is from August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) to July of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944). During this phase, one-year short-term primary schools will be gradually converted into two-year short-term primary schools. In the last year of this phase, namely the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), at least 80% of school-age children nationwide should receive at least two years of short-term primary school education.</p>
<p>The third phase is from August of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944). Two-year short-term primary schools should be gradually converted into four-year junior primary schools, so that all school-age children nationwide receive at least four years of compulsory education.</p>
<p>The current one-year short-term primary schools enroll children aged nine to twelve and provide them with instruction in the national language, arithmetic, civics, and physical education. Tuition is free, and students' school supplies are also provided free of charge by the school. Those who should enroll but do not will first have their parents or elder brothers persuaded to allow them to enroll. If, after repeated persuasion, they still do not allow their children to enroll, they will be fined one to five yuan and still be ordered to allow their children to enroll.</p>
<p>However, in order to implement this ten-year plan for compulsory education, it is first necessary to prepare funding. In the past, the slow progress of compulsory education was due to financial difficulties, which was a major reason. When formulating the ten-year plan this time, in addition to ordering provinces and cities to raise funds on their own, the central government also allocated funds to subsidize them. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the central government subsidized provinces and cities with 3.2 million yuan. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), this was increased to 4.75 million yuan, and it is planned to gradually increase this amount in the future. At the same time, provinces and cities are also urged to gradually raise more funds, in the hope that the promotion of compulsory education will not be delayed due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>With funding secured, the Ministry of Education, on the one hand, (1) established the National Compulsory Education Committee of the Ministry of Education to assist in the national compulsory education, (2) reviewed the income and expenditure of compulsory education funds in various provinces and cities, and (3) appointed supervisors to go to various provinces and cities to inspect, urge, and provide guidance. On the other hand, (1) it issued a notice to all provinces and cities to formulate and determine plans for the implementation of compulsory education, (2) it issued a notice to all provinces and cities to organize provincial and county compulsory education committees to assist the competent educational administrative organs of the provinces, counties, and cities in handling compulsory education, and (3) it issued a notice to all provinces and cities to divide primary school districts, dividing each district into approximately one thousand households, and actively engaging in the establishment of short-term primary schools. In recent years, a total of 48,000 short-term primary schools and 16,000 short-term primary school classes have been added nationwide, with more than 4 million students. This year, in order to promote the work of compulsory education in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education has specially organized a training class for compulsory education cadres in Beijing. 各省市recommendedrelevant personnel to come to Beijing for training. This training has now begun. In the future, after the trainees return to their provinces, they will be responsible for training compulsory education personnel in the counties and cities, so that the personnel engaged in compulsory education work can clearly understand and implement all laws, regulations, and procedures.

<p>From the perspective of this type of sports program, it can be seen that Soviet Russia uses all-around sports methods to promote sports among the people. Members of various groups who pass the exam are awarded certificates and medals by the central government. Those who pass the first-level exam must continue training for one year before they can take the first-level exam. The second-level sports standard includes 24 items, including physiology, hygiene, and sports theory. Those who obtain the second level can enjoy the rights of various sports associations and can directly enter sports schools. In 1935, there were 10,000 people nationwide who obtained the first-level award. By the summer of 1926, this had increased to more than 3.6 million people. There were 5,000 people who obtained the second-level award, including 200 women. 600,000 children obtained the Dyamo award. According to national statistics, approximately 8.71 million people participated in sports, with women accounting for one-third. In the past two years, approximately 200 sports fields have been built in various cities, schools, factories, military camps, etc. In the Soviet Union's second five-year plan, physical education is the main undertaking for training the people. Therefore, special attention is paid to the planning and design of training sports instructors. There are currently four vocational schools specializing in physical education, with more than 4,000 male and female students. In the past three years, 20 physical education secondary schools have been added, with 4,200 male and female students. In addition, 25 physical education departments have been attached to various normal schools, with more than 2,900 students. In total, there are more than 10,000 people studying physical education. In 1935, the graduates from various levels of schools were: (A) 415 physical education specialists, (B) 476 secondary physical education school graduates, (C) more than 900 graduates from normal school affiliated departments, (D) approximately 2,000 people from special physical education training classes.

<h3 id="e121">After Jiangsu Province Banned Grain Exports, Shanghai Will Also Properly Arrange Measures - Provincial and Municipal Governments Cooperate to Prevent Unscrupulous Merchants from Manipulating <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that this year, most parts of Jiangsu Province have reported bumper harvests, but the prices of various grains are still rising sharply. One reason is that unscrupulous merchants buy and transport them for export, and the other is that foreign merchants buy them in bulk in the interior. As a result, people are restless and grain prices are rising. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, for the sake of maintaining the people's food supply, has strictly prohibited the export of grain and has also imposed controls on transportation to other provinces and cities in the country.</p>
<p>Grain Problem in This City</p>
<p>This city relies on Jiangsu Province for its grain supply. It is learned from grain merchants that the current ban on grain exports formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government is not a ban on exports out of the province. Therefore, this city can still have grain produced in Jiangsu Province transported to Shanghai. However, the procedures still need to be approved by the government before passports can be issued for transportation. Therefore, this city hopes that the procedures can be quick and simple, because this city is a commercial and industrial area and has a large population, so it needs a large amount of grain supply from various provinces.</p>
<p>Suzhou and Shanghai Consult on Cooperation</p>
<p>This city is a major trading port, and unscrupulous merchants are very active. Therefore, the city government is also studying detailed measures regarding grain exports. Generally, merchants who transport grain for export must first report to the government the destination and the quantity of transportation before signing the passport. At the same time, the customs must also be notified that exports are only allowed with a passport. Now that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has implemented a ban on grain exports, this city, which is connected to Jiangsu Province, should formulate detailed measures as soon as possible to implement them in order to achieve cooperative results.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Measures to Exempt Cooperatives from Stamp Duty <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Replied to the Municipal Government Yesterday - Except for Accounting Books and Registration Certificates, All Others Should be Affixed with Stamps According to Law</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, explaining the measures to exempt cooperatives from stamp duty. The letter stated that according to the Shanghai Municipal Government's letter No. 484 of October 8, 1936, submitted by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the China Economic Credit Insurance Cooperative requested the Ministry to instruct and verify whether stamp duty can be exempted on the cooperative's books and documents, etc. After reviewing the Cooperative Law's Article 6 stipulates that cooperatives may be exempt from income tax and business tax, but stamp duty and other taxes are not included. The Stamp Duty Law's Article 3, Section 6 stipulates that the certificates used by cooperatives are exempt from stamp duty, which is limited to accounting books. There are no clear provisions for exemption on other certificates. However, the registration certificate issued to the cooperative by the competent authority has been approved by the Ministry of Industry, stating that this registration certificate is issued specifically for inspection and suppression. After verification by the Ministry, it should be exempted in accordance with the provisions of the 32nd item of the Stamp Duty Rate Table's tax-exempt category. Except for accounting books and registration certificates, all other certificates used by the China Economic Credit Insurance Limited Liability Cooperative should be affixed with stamps according to law to emphasize tax law. The aforementioned reply is hereby issued for your review and compliance.</p>

<p>Dagong News reports that the Zhejiang Provincial Government recently issued an order from the Department of Civil Affairs to the governments of various counties, strictly prohibiting the export of rice and grain from Zhejiang Province, because the export of rice and grain within the province affects the people's food supply. Therefore, rice transport ships from various gangs have been detained in the Jiaxing and Pinghu areas in recent days, and rice merchants and boatmen have also been arrested. At the same time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided at the routine meeting on the 27th to formulate ten provisional measures to strictly prohibit the export of grain, and promulgated them for implementation. The Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association of this city believes that the authorities of the two provinces prohibiting the export of rice affects the people's food supply and has repeatedly received reports from colleagues and rice merchants in various places requesting assistance. Therefore, at 3 pm yesterday, a temporary emergency meeting was convened at the New Kaihe Guild Hall to discuss countermeasures. Chairman Gu Xinyi first had each member report on the situation of rice ships being detained in Zhejiang Province and the strict prohibition of exports in Jiangsu Province, and then began to discuss. The following three measures were decided: (1) Appoint Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Chen Ziyi as three representatives to present a petition to Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 2 pm on the 29th (today), requesting that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces immediately revoke the ban and release the rice ships and merchants. (2) Petition the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a petition to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, asking them to consider the people's food supply and revoke the ban. (3) Recommend Gu Xinyi to represent the association to petition the Executive Yuan in Beijing. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. It is reported that Gu will take advantage of the opportunity to present a plane to Beijing to celebrate the birthday and will bring the petition to Beijing on the 31st (tomorrow) to petition the Executive Yuan, requesting that an order be issued to the authorities of all provinces to regulate the national food supply without relying on provincial or municipal administrations.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, saying, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 27th of this month, the Motor and Silk Weaving Factory Association of this city stated in a letter that, in order to assist the government in carrying out anti-smuggling and to maintain the sales of legitimate goods, the association will conduct identification of silk fabrics produced by members starting from October 1st, and affix a stamp on both ends of the silk to prove it. Currently, the products of members, whether old or new, have been stamped at the same time, and it is expected that all procedures will be completed before the 3rd of October, so that starting from November 1st, all silk fabrics produced by members will have the stamp of the association to prove it. If there are any silk fabrics that have not been stamped, it means that they have not been subjected to identification procedures, and the association will no longer provide proof. In this way, when the products of members are transported and sold to the interior, the anti-smuggling agencies along the way can easily identify them at both ends of the silk, so that legitimate domestic products can have the opportunity to be transported and sold conveniently. In addition to submitting two copies of the association's silk fabric identification rules, we are also sending two copies of the seal of the silk fabric certification stamp affixed to both ends of the silk for your review and approval. Please forward them to the Ministry of Finance and order the anti-smuggling agencies in various provinces and cities to verify this seal when inspecting the products of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory, and allow them to be released with the transport or distribution license to prove it, and to facilitate transportation and sales. To the meeting, the association conducts identification procedures for the products of the entire city's silk weaving factory colleagues, dividing them into four categories: silk fabrics, silk interwoven fabrics, rayon fabrics, and rayon interwoven fabrics. All goods identified by the association are stamped with the name of the product at both ends of the piece to distinguish them. It is for the purpose of assisting anti-smuggling personnel in identifying silk fabrics and maintaining the transportation and sales of domestic silk. It is beneficial to both commercial inspection and administration. We are sending the original silk fabric identification rules and a copy of the silk fabric certification seal for your Ministry's review and approval. It is publicly convenient to order the anti-smuggling agencies in various places to pay attention to it. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce expresses its gratitude."</p>

<p>Guangdong shipping merchants are seeking the cancellation of the annual and seasonal fees for ferryboats and electric boats in the province. The Shipping Association convened a meeting and recommended Chairman Xie Zhongchi to go to Beijing to petition. Mr. Xie has already left Guangdong and arrived in Shanghai and will go to Beijing within days to present everything to the relevant ministries and commissions of the Central Government. According to reporters, the fees have been collected by the Port Authority for a long time. Shipping merchants have repeatedly requested cancellation in the past, but it has not been approved. Now, since the establishment of the Guangdong Bureau, the Ministry has established a Maritime Affairs Bureau to handle maritime affairs, and the Department of Construction has established a Shipping Administration Bureau to preside over the collection. Shipping merchants believe that the amount of the tax is not stipulated in the maritime regulations. At a time when national political orders are unified, it seems inappropriate to have such a tax that is like an excessive miscellaneous tax. Therefore, they deeply hope that the Central Government will consider the people's difficulties and order the abolition of the tax to benefit shipping merchants. It is also heard that the tax revenue of more than 200,000 yuan a year is only enough to cover the administrative expenses of tax collection. If it is abolished by order, it will have no impact on finance or construction.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Inventor Yang Ming Establishes Invention Research Organization <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Membership from All Circles</p>
<p>Inventor Yang Ming has recently invented a method of extracting white sugar from flour and brown sugar. In order to enable research and investment from all circles, he has established the China Invention Research Institute. The invention process is described below:</p>
<p>Invention Process: In the summer of the 23rd year, Yang Ming felt that China's sugar industry was underdeveloped. The national business revenue each year reached more than 10 million yuan. In particular, the consumption of white sugar all relied on foreign goods, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, he used his academic knowledge to study how to extract white sugar from brown sugar and flour. The method is to first extract brown sugar to increase its sweetness by half of the original brown sugar, and then add flour and mix it to make flour sugar. Its use and sweetness are equal to white sugar, and its cost is half the market price of white sugar, which is of great importance to the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Establishment of Research Institute: Now, in order to expand research, Mr. Yang has specially established the China Invention Research Institute to provide services to the national industrial and commercial circles in terms of invention and research, and to assist in soliciting joint membership from all circles across the country. The methods are divided into five groups: (1) Economic Sponsorship Group, (2) Research Cooperation Group, (3) Contacts Group for All Circles, (4) Office Service Group, and (5) Auxiliary Learning Group.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Weaving Factory Employees Beat Gatekeeper Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News reports that workers Zhang Paxi, etc. from five silk weaving factories in this city, Baohua, Tiancheng, Yiyou, Yucun, and Yongfeng on Baoli South Road in Caojiadu, recently convened a meeting to organize the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union and have obtained a permit from the Municipal Party Department and are actively preparing for it. However, due to misunderstandings on the part of the capitalists, the Baohua Factory first laid off 12 worker representatives from the factory, including Zhang Boxi, Xu Housheng, Huang Heqin, Zhu Shengrong, Zhou Ju'e, Zhou Xian'e, Zhang Yuzhen, and Shen Cuixian, on the grounds of sluggish production. At the same time, Tiancheng Factory also dismissed four worker representatives, and Yiyou Factory dismissed 16 people, which aroused public indignation among the workers. At about 5 pm yesterday, Zhang Paxi and more than 30 of the laid-off workers first went to the Baohua Factory to request reinstatement. Because the factory owner Chen Bingjun was not present, they could not get what they wanted. Passing by the Yucun Factory, the workers in the factory heard the news and all rushed out to respond. Several gatekeepers and staff members of the factory immediately attacked the workers, and a mutual fight broke out between the two sides. The Caojiadu Public Security Bureau heard the news and immediately sent Inspector Zhao to lead more than 60 police officers to disperse the workers. As a result, several people, including Zhang Boxi, Xu Housheng, Qian Zhangxi, Zhang Jinhua, Zhang Hepeng, and Wang Lingfeng, were seriously injured, and more than 30 people, including Li Taohua, Shi Juan'er, Qian Cengyun, Qian Zhangfei, Qian Fenzhu, and Qian Shengzhu, were slightly injured. The injured workers involved in the incident have now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

The Staff Reduction Committee has a total of five members, namely, Fessenden (American Director), Keswick, and Bageire (both British Directors). First, Director-General Fessenden submitted a memorandum to the Chairman, suggesting the exploration of some practical approaches to achieve real reductions in the Municipal Council's existing personnel expenses without causing undue interruption of work. The memorandum drafted at that time was considered sufficient for the committee to follow, so no formal instructions were presented. The committee's discussions included staff salaries and service regulations, but the issue of staff quotas was not included.</p>

<p>Jumping Ashore from the Bow of a Boat, Unfortunately Falling into the River and Drowning</p>
<p>Zhong Huairui from Gaoyou and his son Zhong Shun, 18 years old, have been setting up a beef noodle stall at the Huacheng Wharf, and the business has been quite good. Unexpectedly, the crew of the Lisheng boat, which was docked at the wharf the day before yesterday, summoned Zhong to get a bowl of beef noodles to eat on the boat. At about 10 o'clock, Zhong Shun boarded the ship to collect the noodle money and bowl. Just as he was about to return to the shore, the ship unexpectedly set sail and was two or three feet away from the wharf. Zhong disregarded everything and jumped off the ship. Although the crew and others tried to dissuade him, it was too late. He fell into the river and tragically drowned. It was not until the afternoon that the body was recovered. The Huishan Police Station, which has jurisdiction over the area, was informed and ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Felun Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, the prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and recorder Zhu Zuyi, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. According to the detectives' report, Mr. Song then ruled that the deceased, Zhong Shun, was a male and had drowned to death before his death. The body was handed over to his father, Zhong Huairui, for burial after signing a statement.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Foreign Merchant Steamer Runs Aground Repeatedly – New Channel Discovered in the Yangtze River – Jiangxin Steamer Has Found a New Waterway <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Recent significant changes in the Yangtze River waterway, due to a sharp drop in water levels, have rendered several sections impassable for river transport. It has become necessary to find new channels to facilitate traffic. The Jiangxin, a steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recently entered port. A reporter visited the ship’s owner, Mr. Huang Youshi, to inquire about the Yangtze River’s water conditions and the search for new waterways. Mr. Huang explained in detail that the rapid and early retreat of the Yangtze River this year is rare in its history. When the ship set out from Hankou, the water level was measured at twenty-seven feet. Upon reaching a location below Datong, known as</p>
<p>Earth Bridge Lighthouse</p>
<p>the water level had dropped significantly, causing changes in the navigation route. A foreign merchant steamer, the Mareitta, loaded with cargo from Hankou bound for Shanghai, ran aground at Zhangjiagang, downstream of Jiujiang, due to the sharp drop in water levels. Despite strenuous efforts, the cargo was transshipped, and the vessel managed to escape the initial grounding. As it proceeded downstream towards the Earth Bridge Lighthouse waterway below Datong, where the customs authorities had erected a beacon to indicate the navigation path, an unexpected change in the waterway occurred. The Mareitta, sailing along the designated route at that location,</p>
<p>Ran Aground a Second Time</p>
<p>in the Earth Bridge Lighthouse waterway because the water level had dropped below twenty feet. Since the steamer required a draft of more than twenty-one feet, it became deeply mired in the shallows and could not extricate itself. An urgent telegram was sent to Shanghai requesting assistance. Jardine Matheson sent three of its largest tugboats and eight large iron barges to the scene, planning to first lighten the steamer by transferring its cargo before attempting to refloat it. The Jiangxin steamer passed by while the rescue operation was underway. To ensure safety, Mr. Huang did not dare to follow the original navigation route and instead sought a new path, finding a depth of thirty-one and a half feet on the outer circle, thereby safely passing through. Upon the ship’s arrival in Wuhu, Huang Youshi reported the situation to the Wuhu Customs, who agreed to</p>
<p>Relocate the Beacon</p>
<p>to prevent further mishaps to river steamers. Simultaneously, a notice would be issued to all vessels to use the outer circle. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the Jiaoshan section of the Yangtze River near Zhenjiang, another significant hazard was discovered. The Jiaoshan section is typically a thoroughfare for upstream and downstream river traffic, but its riverbed contains numerous reefs. Normally, the water is deep enough to pose no obstacle to navigation, and river steamers pay little attention to them. However, due to the significant drop in water levels, the reefs were now only ten feet below the surface, while Yangtze River steamers typically require a draft of eleven feet or more. Vessels passing through this area risked striking the reefs, which posed a severe danger. Upon assessing the situation, Captain Huang was greatly alarmed and quickly diverted the ship to the</p>
<p>Dagang Waterway</p>
<p>bypassing Jiaoshan on the right to avoid this extremely hazardous zone. After the Jiangxin steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday, in the afternoon, Mr. Huang Youshi went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to report on the Yangtze River channel’s water levels and changes. He requested that the company promptly inform all its Yangtze River steamers to use the Dagang route when navigating up and downstream past Jiaoshan to avoid colliding with the reefs, and to use the outer circle at the Earth Bridge Lighthouse for safety. Given the rapid drop in water levels, there is concern that within a month, the Yangtze River channel will follow in the footsteps of Changsha and become impassable. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram from Xiangdian stating that the water level above Lulin Tan in Changsha was only two feet, making it impossible for even larger barges to pass, and only small boats with a draft of just over one foot could carry cargo.</p>

Recently, she has been dancing at the Good Friends Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII. Yesterday afternoon, around 6 PM, Li discovered that a new dress she had bought had been pledged by her husband, Lu Genrong, leading to an argument between the couple. In a moment of anger, Li climbed onto the windowsill of the garret and jumped, attempting suicide. After falling to the ground, she spat out blood and fell unconscious. Her family rushed to report the incident to the police, who summoned an ambulance and transported her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Her condition is very critical.</p>

<p>Origin of the Dharma Assembly</p>
<p>In the summer of this year, the Bodhi Society, the Buddhist Jingye Society, and benevolent believers from all walks of life initiated the Bingzi Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly. At that time, Han and Tibetan monks, both exoteric and esoteric Dharma masters, gathered in one place to preach the scriptures and practice the Dharma, benefiting sentient beings. It was a complete and extraordinary event. For months, various regions have experienced abundant harvests and the people have enjoyed their work. The participants deeply appreciate the Buddha’s compassion and are increasingly diligent. The Dharma gate is immeasurable, and they vow to follow their studies, requesting the turning of the Dharma wheel without fatigue. They considered that to eliminate the five defilements of this land, one must take Amitabha’s great vow as the principle, and to eliminate the three poisons of sentient beings, one must take Avalokitesvara’s great compassion as the foundation. However, Amitabha’s vows cannot be achieved without Avalokitesvara’s compassion, so the great compassion Dharma assembly must be widely promoted. Venerable Master Yin, a respected elder of our time, whose merits, practices, and vows are universally admired, has been cultivating the Tao in Wumen in recent years, practicing meditation in seclusion. Moved by the chaos in the world, his compassionate vows have become even stronger. The residents of this society, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, and Guan Jiongzhi, and others, went to Suzhou to request him to propagate the Dharma. The Venerable Master, with great compassion, readily agreed. Therefore, on November 21, they will respectfully welcome the Dharma chariot to Shanghai to preside over the establishment of the great compassion Dharma assembly for seven days, while holding the Buddha’s name, dedicating the merit to protecting the country and relieving disasters, and speaking to the masses about the Pure Land Dharma, hoping that everyone will practice. This is truly a rare opportunity. They also invited Dharma Master Yuan Ying to lead the congregation in incense cultivation, adorning the congregation with incense light. The Avatamsaka Sutra initially taught Samantabhadra with the ten great vows, leading to the Amitabha Buddha in the Pure Land. The Universal Gate Chapter of the Lotus Sutra greatly extols the merits of reciting the name of Avalokitesvara. It is known that Amitabha and Avalokitesvara encompass the entire teachings of the Tathagata from beginning to end. If one can recite the name of Amitabha with one thought, then that one thought resonates with the compassion of the two sages. If one recites the name of Amitabha with every thought, then every thought resonates with the compassion of the virtuous sages. Pure thoughts follow one another, eliminating greed, anger, and delusion. If everyone is like this, then this world will become a Pure Land, the nation will be secure, and disasters will cease. It is hoped that all great benefactors will generate a Bodhi mind, rejoice in the merits, and jointly accomplish this adornment. This is the beginning.</p>

<p>Zhou Liu, a Jiangbei woman residing at No. 3408 Hart Road, gave birth to a son named Xiao Heitan (Small Black Coal) last year. A few days ago, Xiao Heitan suddenly fell ill. As her husband, Zhou Jianguo, was knowledgeable in medicine, he treated the child himself. However, on the 26th of this month, Xiao Heitan passed away due to the severity of his illness despite medical treatment. The Zhou family then purchased a small coffin for the burial and hired someone to carry it out and abandon it in a wasteland on Maibai Road. Unexpectedly, around 8 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Constable No. 2752 of the Putuo Road police station reported receiving information about a child crying inside a small coffin in the wasteland on Maibai Road. The constable went to investigate and confirmed the report. He immediately telegraphed the police station, which dispatched an ambulance to the scene, and the child was removed from the coffin. He was taken to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that the child was not dead but was suffering from pneumonia and was admitted for treatment. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to identify the child’s family to investigate why they had abandoned the child, who was still alive. Zhou Liu and Zhou Jianguo were taken into custody by the police station. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Shi Yaotang prosecuted them in Special Court No. 1 for abandonment under Article 194 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, both defendants confessed that Xiao Heitan was their biological son and had indeed died a few days ago, so they placed him in a coffin and abandoned him in the wasteland, but they did not know how he had been revived. Judge Fu acquitted Zhou Liu and Zhou Jianguo in court, but they were each released on bail of 200 yuan pending appeal. The child will remain in Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>

He will take a boat back to Shanghai with his car in a few days. There were four people in the car on this trip, in addition to Bullock himself, one was an employee of the China Travel Service, one was a mechanic, and one was a servant. In addition to gasoline, the car also carried wooden boards for crossing rivers, as well as shovels, food, luggage, and other items. This trip can be described as an unprecedented feat.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Robbery and Murder of Indian Constable Case – Key Suspects Apprehended One After Another – Because Details of the Case Have Not Been Thoroughly Investigated, the Two Suspects Will Be Detained for One Week for Further Interrogation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd of last month at 10:05 AM, the home of Dr. Liu Yixiang at No. 3, Lane 429, Marius Road, was suddenly invaded by multiple robbers intending to rob the premises. When Liu’s family members shouted for help, the robbers were unable to carry out the robbery and fled. Indian Constable No. 498, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and grabbed one of the robbers. During the struggle, the other robbers opened fire on the constable, fatally wounding him. All the robbers managed to escape. Later, Chief Detective You Agen of the Zhabei police station, detectives Lang Chengpei, and Bao Tan Wu Shoushan, learned that Chen Zhikang (also known as Chen Ligen, Jin Sikang, F桶者), a local resident, was the main suspect in the case. However, Chen’s whereabouts were uncertain, but he was known to be active in Zhabei and Dachang. They then worked with detectives from the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau to wait in Dachang, but without success. They then encountered Chen at No. 564 Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei and immediately arrested him, taking him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Chen confessed to the crime and stated that the instigator of the case was his boss, Xu Siwen (nicknamed Siwen Map皮, who had many followers). Detectives then arrested Xu at No. 620 Zhejiang Road at 1:25 AM the day before yesterday. Based on Xu’s confession, they apprehended Yao Zanfu (also known as Bingsheng) at No. 51 Linyin Road and Sun Qishun at No. 87 Songyuan Road, working with detectives from the Shanghai Public Safety Bureau. Yao and Sun were temporarily detained at the Public Safety Bureau. Chen and Xu were escorted to the Criminal Division of Special Court No. 1 at 9 AM yesterday. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the situation and stated that the suspects had just been arrested and had not yet been thoroughly investigated, and that two other suspects were currently detained at the Public Safety Bureau. He requested permission to detain them. When questioned, Chen Zhikang confessed that on the day of the incident, Xu Siwen invited Yao Zanfu, Sun Qishun, and him to Xu’s home at No. 11 Chengxin Lane, Huade Road. Xu and Sun each carried a pistol, and he carried a fake pistol. They went to rob, but were unable to complete the robbery and left. An Indian constable then arrested Sun Qishun, and Xu then opened fire and shot the constable. When questioned, Xu Siwen completely denied the charges. Criminal Division Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confessions and ordered that the suspects be detained for one week for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhu Agen, a native of Wuxi, was carrying a bag of red pills, each containing one thousand pills, on his person around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, intending to transport them to a certain place for sale, when he was spotted by Chinese Detective Jin Haibo, who suspected his behavior. He ordered him to stop for a search, but Zhu, in a panic, ran away towards Feren Road. Detective Jin gave chase, and Zhu threw the red pills to the ground. As a result, he was still captured. At that time, a Japanese person picked up the bag of red pills and left. He had to take the other bag to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and said that the defendant had a similar case in the near past and had served eight months in prison. He was released in May of this year and was incorrigible. He asked for severe punishment. Detective Jin then reported the process, and the poison pills were presented for inspection. When questioned by the defendant, his statement was ambiguous. Judge Xiao Xiezhen sentenced Zhu Agen to ten years of imprisonment, and the exhibits were confiscated.</p>

<p>Zhou Amao, a 18-year-old from Ningbo, was an apprentice at the American Fruit Store at No. 1253 Jing’an Temple Road. Yesterday noon, he rode his bicycle to deliver goods. At 12:25 PM, while traveling west on Haig Road at the intersection of Diefeng Road, he was hit by public bus No. 427, registration No. 15089, of the British-owned Public Omnibus Company, which ran between Jing’an Temple and Hongqiao. The bus, driven by Zheng Changyou, a man from Jiangbei, was also traveling west, coming from behind Zhou’s bicycle. Because driver Zheng Changyou was careless, he knocked down Zhou along with his bicycle, dragging them for more than three yards before the bus finally stopped. Zhou was pinned under the bus, his right ribs and both arms were crushed, and he was only slightly conscious, spitting up blood. Chinese Constable No. 30002 of the Jing’an Temple Police Station saw the incident and gathered pedestrians to lift the front of the bus and pull Zhou out. He was immediately taken to the Red Cross General Hospital, but he died before he could receive treatment. The French Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate the incident. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for an autopsy and the case was reported to Special Court No. 1 to send personnel to examine the body today.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Posing as Hospital to Solicit Donations and Defraud – Police File a Public Prosecution – Three Women Seem Deeply Regretful with Tears Streaming Down Faces – The Case Was Heard Yesterday and Sentencing Scheduled for Tomorrow <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Detective No. 10 of the Putuo Road Police Station and Western Detective Captain Boden previously cracked a case within the concession involving young women who specialized in falsely claiming to represent the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital and the Guangji Charity Hospital to solicit donations and defraud people. The suspects, Yang Ying (i.e., Yang Ling, Yang Wenzhun), Sun Suozhen, Sun Cuilan (i.e., Sun Amao), and male accomplices Zhang Xuexiang, Sun Laisheng, and Zheng Guantai (i.e., Doulou Afu, manager of the Zhonghua Rolling Mill), were handed over to the First Special District Court. It was learned that all the defendants specialized in</p>
<p>Soliciting Donations by Deception</p>
<p>as their occupation. Since 1933, up until their arrest, they had committed countless crimes within the Public Concession, amounting to hundreds and thousands of cases. The amount of fraudulently obtained donations was also staggering, totaling tens of thousands of yuan. The court ordered a further investigation into the matter. The police have now completed their investigation into the case and yesterday morning, they handed it over to the First Special Court, where police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution under Article 340 of the Criminal Code for habitual fraud. He also</p>
<p>Stated the Case</p>
<p>The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Xiufang to appear in court to defend them. When questioned, defendant Yang Ying stated that she was originally from Jiading and was brought to Shanghai in 1933 by Sun Cuilan, who introduced her to Zheng Guantai to work as a fundraiser. She first went to Hong Kong and raised 2,000 yuan with Zheng and Sun before returning to Shanghai. At that time, Zheng paid her a monthly salary of ten yuan. Later, she fundraised in Shanghai under the name of the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital. In January of this year, she had some disagreements with Zheng, and Zheng's hospital</p>
<p>Also Closed Down</p>
<p>She returned to her hometown and came to Shanghai again in April, hired by Hu Weimin, who claimed to be the director of the Guangji Charity Hospital, and continued to work as a fundraiser until she was arrested this time. Zheng Guantai stated that he met a person named Lin Zhenchun on the road, and Lin said that he wanted to start a hospital and asked me to be a director. When he said that there were financial difficulties, he planned to hire young women to go out and solicit donations. Lin then introduced Sun Cuilan, who in turn introduced Yang Ying, and fundraising began. Sun Laisheng was recommended by me to Lin as a tea servant,</p>
<p>With a Monthly Salary of Eight Yuan</p>
<p>Sun Suozhen’s monthly salary was fourteen yuan, and my monthly salary was twenty yuan. When questioned, Sun Suozhen, Sun Laisheng, and Sun Cuilan all gave vague answers. Zhang Xuexiang said that he was related to Yang Ying and came to Shanghai recently because he was unemployed, only for four days, and was arrested for sending letters at Yang’s behest. Judge Chuan Lin reviewed the confessions and said that Yang and the other three women were all young and well-educated. Instead of thinking about finding a proper outlet or choosing someone to serve, they were exploited, ruining their reputation and morals. Once arrested, they could not escape the clutches of the law, which was pitiful. The two women, hearing this argument, lowered their heads without a word, tears streaming down their faces.

<p>Husband Claims They are Divorced – Court Orders Investigation for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Fan Tinggui, a 36-year-old native of Wuxi, runs the Xin Hengtai Iron Factory at No. 102 Singapore Road. On November 12, 1920, he married Zhu Yundi in his hometown. After the marriage, they lived together in Shanghai for five years, and had a daughter named Yuying, who is now nine years old. However, recently, the couple's relationship suddenly deteriorated. On July 13 of this year, Zhu Yundi suddenly swallowed a gold ring in a suicide attempt. Since then, they have agreed to divorce. On June 2 of the lunar calendar, a divorce agreement was established, with Fan paying Zhu 3,000 yuan. Zhu</p>
<p>Also Moved Out</p>

Fan then married Luo Lili (also known as Yingming, 17 years old) on September 7 of this year at the Yipinxiang Restaurant at No. 270 Rue Chapsal and lived together in the factory. Unexpectedly, Zhu suddenly denied knowing about the divorce agreement, filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Fan of bigamy. Because a husband and wife could not file a lawsuit against each other, the court instructed that it would not be accepted. Zhu then hired lawyer Wang Shizong on the 19th of the month and reported the case to the Laozha Police Station, requesting</p>
<p>A Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Chief Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Li Shugui conducted an investigation and requested the First Special District Court to issue a summons, summoning Fan Tinggui and Luo Lili to the Criminal Division of the court yesterday morning. Judge Qian Hongye presided over the hearing. First, police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and charged them with bigamy under Article 237 of the Criminal Code. Zhu then stated the circumstances of her marriage to Fan, claiming that her move was for health reasons and not a divorce from the defendant. When questioned, Fan Tinggui stated that although the plaintiff was his wife, they</p>
<p>Were Already Divorced</p>
<p>There was a written document with the plaintiff’s cousin, Zhu Rongchu, and aunt, Chen Xikang, as witnesses. The 3,000 yuan alimony was given by me to Zhu Chen and transferred to the plaintiff. Because they were already divorced, he married Luo. When questioned, Luo Lili stated that she knew Fan had a wife, but because they were divorced, she married him. Zhu Yundi denied that she had divorced Fan and received the 3,000 yuan alimony. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, then produced evidence that the plaintiff had deposited 1,000 yuan of the 3,000 yuan alimony she received in the Si Ming Bank and 1,000 yuan in the Shanghai Bank, and should be investigated. Judge Qian then ordered the case to be adjourned for one week, ordering the police to investigate whether the plaintiff’s deposit and the house she currently lives in were rented by Fan.</p>

<p>Zhang Sun Xiuzhen, a 38-year-old woman from Hangzhou, currently residing at No. 2 Guangyu Lane, Jialu Road, French Concession, Shanghai, became lonely after her husband, Zhang Rongshun, passed away from illness in August of the 21st year of the Republic of China. She then began a relationship with Jiang Yuequan (age 50, from Shaoxing), the manager of the Guanghua Mirror Factory on Yongxing Road, Zhabei. She conceived three times, one of which was twins, resulting in four children. Currently, three children are alive and living with Ms. Zhang’s son from her previous marriage, Zhang Xuchu, in the same residence.</p>
<p>For years, despite the</p>
<p>Age Disparity</p>
<p>the relationship has been quite good. Recently, because Jiang had not visited her for a long time, she felt she was aging and being abandoned. Consequently, she hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the local court against Jiang for disrupting her family, deceiving her out of her property, and abandoning his illegitimate children. The lawsuit roughly stated that after her late husband's death, the defendant came to her home with sweet talk and false diligence, taking advantage of the plaintiff's naivety as a woman and her weak will, and her orphaned son Xuchu and others being young children. As a result, she lost her chastity, and her son recognized a false father. Over the past five years, she conceived</p>
<p>Three Illegitimate Pregnancies</p>
<p>resulting in four children, one of whom passed away. Currently, three children are alive. They rented a place with the defendant above the Renshoutang Pharmacy on Datong Road, Zhabei. She had registered Jiang Ji'an, also known as Yuequan, in the household registration. In the process, she was deceived out of more than 10,000 yuan of inheritance, as well as gold jewelry, clothing, and other items. Now, seeing that the plaintiff is old, her inheritance has been exhausted, and his desire has been satisfied, he has discarded her like worn-out shoes, and has not come for two months, leaving her children starving and crying.</p>
<p>His intentions are malicious</p>
<p>He has committed crimes under Articles 294, 339, and 343 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi held a court hearing. The plaintiff stated that after cohabitating with Jiang Yuequan, she was deceived out of 3,000 yuan in tin foil, 2,000 yuan in savings, another 1,500 yuan, another 200 yuan, another 500 yuan, another 200 yuan, 200 yuan for her parents-in-law, another 700 yuan, and 1,000 yuan for the Jiangwan house rent, a tomb deed, as well as gold bracelets, a gold watch, and grey squirrel fur clothing. After living with him, she had four children. Now he has abandoned her, causing the rent to be unpaid for eight months, and he himself has not visited her for two months.</p>
<p>Seeking Legal Justice</p>
<p>and demanding the return of money. The defendant, Jiang Yuequan, hired lawyer Yuan Hanyun to appear in court and stated, "I went to Shaoxing to recover from an illness, which is why I only missed seeing her for two weeks. I didn't know she would be so impatient and sue me for no reason. As for the money and property, it's all fabricated. Moreover, I have been providing her monthly living expenses without fail. Otherwise, how could a young woman be supporting an old man?" The judge, noting that the two parties have already had many children together, suggested that they first try to reach a settlement outside of court, before delving into the details. Therefore, the hearing was postponed for further investigation.</p>

<p>The Shaoxing Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai founded a primary school in Shanghai to educate the children of Shaoxing. Tang Liqing was hired as the principal. The school's funding was subsidized annually by the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Bureau with 2,000 yuan, divided into four installments. Tang was responsible for collecting the funds with a letter of introduction from the association's board of directors. It was not until the end of last year, when Tang left his position and a new principal was hired, that it was discovered that Tang had embezzled two installments of the subsidy, totaling 1,000 yuan. At that time, the directors of the association had a fellow-townsman relationship with Tang and considered the ties of kinship. They were reluctant to immediately pursue the matter legally and only warned him in the newspaper to quickly clear the debt to avoid losing his reputation. However, Tang has still ignored the matter. Therefore, the association decided to send officer Qian Youlan as a representative to file a criminal lawsuit against Tang with the First Special District Local Court for embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng held a court hearing. The defendant, Tang Liqing, is currently missing and cannot be located. According to Qian Youlan, who appeared in court, after discovering Tang's fraudulent activities, he also stated that he did not know the defendant's whereabouts. Judge Huang stated that since the defendant's whereabouts are currently unknown, the case is difficult to proceed with and decided to temporarily suspend the trial, instructing the plaintiff to investigate the defendant's whereabouts and then, in the name of the association's chairman, submit a request for further summons.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Chamber of Commerce Writes to the French Municipal Council Requesting to Stop the Abuse of Confiscating Rickshaw Licenses <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, On the 27th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association, requesting that we urge the French Concession Municipal Council to stop the police from abusing the confiscation of rickshaw licenses in order to show compassion. The letter stated that the rickshaw pullers' daily business has been declining sharply in recent years due to the widespread availability of buses and trams, and the poor economic situation. Their situation is already extremely pitiful. However, the French Concession police department is strict and demanding with rickshaw pullers, often finding fault with them, resulting in frequent penalties of license confiscation. Each penalty costs 40 cents or 1 dollar, so that the rickshaw pullers' hard-earned income is often not enough to pay the fines. Those who cannot redeem their licenses immediately are often penalized double the amount after several months. Furthermore, each police officer regards the number of rickshaw licenses confiscated as a standard for measuring their performance. The more, the better. For example, the Mailan Police Station redeems licenses all day long, with rickshaw pullers coming and going in an endless stream, resembling a business operation. The authorities are completely focused on fines and do not care about the rickshaw pullers' difficult business. The association has heard and seen this and cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, we respectfully request that your council forward this matter to the French Concession Municipal Council to strictly prohibit this practice, and instruct all police stations not to arbitrarily confiscate licenses and to reduce the amount of the fines to show that the purpose is to improve traffic and not to collect fines, thereby reducing the suffering of rickshaw pullers, which is to cultivate the vitality of society." Based on this, the rickshaw pullers' operation in the concession, assuming there are any accidental violations of traffic regulations, the police officers do not ask whether there is any intention to violate the regulations, and generally confiscate the licenses. The redemption cost is no less than 40 to 50 cents. May I ask how much hard work does a rickshaw earn a day? Whenever the police confiscate the licenses, the rickshaw pullers beg with sad faces and tears, completely revealing a situation of being unable to afford the fines. In order to improve traffic, your bureau should also consider the lives of ordinary rickshaw pullers. We should respectfully request that you promptly inform the Military Affairs Department that in the future, rickshaw pullers, assuming they commit a police violation, should first be given a warning with a mark, and not immediately confiscate the license and send them for a fine, in order to show compassion. We sincerely hope you will consider this.</p>

<p>Russians P. Bukneits and Chinese Tan Wenhu, Bao Jun, etc., were arrested by the police for impersonating customs officers to defraud Koreans Jia Jiong Bai and Li Xinkui of 13,000 yuan. The details of their case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the hearing in Criminal Court No. 9. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that it has been discovered that before October 5th of this year, Pi and others had defrauded Japanese Kasa Kawa Fujisaburo of the Zhongxing Foreign Firm at No. 182 Kunshan Road of 12,000 pounds of rayon worth 8,100 yuan. The fact is that the defendant Bao Jun usually had contacts with Kasa Kawa. In February of this year, Bao told Kasa that he had many connections with customs officials. If rayon was transported to Shanghai, only a small amount of customs duty needed to be paid. Bao also introduced Pi to Kasa. At that time, Kasa believed it to be true and shipped rayon worth 8,100 yuan from Japan. After the goods arrived in Shanghai, Pi and others used deception to make Kasa hand over the bill of lading to them for safekeeping. Afterwards, they took the goods out and sold them at a low price of 4,000 yuan. Now, due to the urgency of the case, many documents have not been translated yet. Therefore, he requested that the detention period be extended and the case be adjourned. Judge Pan interrogated Kasa Kawa and the defendants and ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Now Completed and Ready for Publication</p>
<p>The Ningguo County Gazetteer was revised during the Kangxi, Qianlong, and Daoguang dynasties of the former Qing Dynasty. However, the editions published during the Qianlong and Daoguang periods were destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion and no longer exist. The only extant edition is the one published during the Kangxi period, which is now over 200 years old and has not been revised since. Local historical documents are difficult to research. During the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, there were repeated discussions about revising the gazetteer, but due to changes in personnel and the high cost, the resolutions were made but the book was never completed. Yang Xiaotian, a native of Ningguo County, is enthusiastic about local public welfare and has provided much financial assistance. Ningyang Park in the county was built with funds donated by Yang. Recently, Yang donated a large sum of money again, enabling the county gazetteer to be revised. The Ningguo County Government hired scholars Li Zhongcheng and Xu Yuntao to lead the project, and hired more than ten interviewers to collect and compile the information. The project took two years and is now completed. It has been handed over to the Hanwen Zhengkai Printing House on Wangping Street in Shanghai for printing. The printing is currently in progress. The gazetteer also includes a preface by the late master of Chinese studies, Mr. Zhang Taiyan. It is expected to be published this year. From now on, not only will the local historical documents of Ningguo County not be lost, but a portion of the anecdotes of Anhui Province can also be researched, which will further enhance local culture.</p>

<p>Lawyer Association Proposal</p>
<p>Shanghai Lawyers Association members Zheng Wentong, etc., stated that civil appeal cases often lack essential elements, resulting in their rejection. They proposed a remedy and suggested that the Lawyers Association submit it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to allow the issuance of an order to all courts nationwide that whenever appeal cases lack essential elements, they should be ordered to be corrected first for remedy. The Association has submitted this case to a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members. After review by the assigned members, it was resolved to submit it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and request that an order be issued to all county courts nationwide that whenever appeal cases lack essential elements, regardless of whether they are represented by a lawyer or drafted by a lawyer, the appellant should be ordered to correct them first for remedy. Yesterday, the Standing Committee submitted a document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting its adoption and the issuance of an order to all courts nationwide to comply.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Upon reading the news item "Workers Engaging in Armed Fights Due to Carrying Goods" in the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on the 28th of this month, it was mentioned that "the old-school workers plan to support Xu Jintang, a standing committee member of the labor union, as their leader, hence the intense infighting," and so on. However, the standing director of our union is Comrade Tang Shanlin, not Xu Jintang. Furthermore, Xu Jintang is not listed on our union's membership roster. We believe this is a rumor. The unfortunate incident occurred because the workers suffered excessive oppression and exploitation of wages by the contractor Li Shibao. Therefore, our union petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau twice to convene a mediation. However, that Li Shibao disregarded everything, using force to oppress and dismiss all our union members, hiring seventy or eighty new workers to replace them, which led to this tragic event. This is truly regrettable. Besides reporting the situation to the Party and government authorities for investigation, we fear that the rumors are inaccurate. Therefore, we specially request your esteemed newspaper to correct this, fulfilling our public duty. Respectfully submitted to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Shanghai Fourth District Civil Ship Carrying Trade Union, October 28th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Upon reading the news item in your esteemed newspaper about the tension between the two sides and the armed fight among fruit workers, we find it inconsistent with the facts. We hereby send this letter to your newspaper, requesting you to correct it as follows: (1) The fruit carrying workers employed by our company are all casual laborers, with no distinction between old and new factions. This unfortunate incident occurred due to casual laborers fighting over work. (2) The report in your newspaper stating that foreman Li Shibao frequently oppressed and exploited the workers' wages is absolutely untrue. Our company has never had the title of "foreman." The workers' wages are paid directly by each shop according to the amount of work done, so there is no possibility of wage exploitation. We earnestly request your esteemed newspaper to publish the aforementioned facts to correct public opinion. Respectfully submitted to Shen Bao, Shanghai Guang Bang Fruit Industry Lianyi Hall, October 28th.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Existing sales are sluggish. Although cotton yarn wants to rise, it still falls. November has already passed the 220-yuan mark.</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation was very soft. This is because existing yarn sales are sluggish, and the cloth trade is also slack, causing market prices to fall. There is a lot of panic, and more people are cutting their losses. In fact, the previous surge was too violent, so this kind of reaction was expected. The November futures yarn has fallen sharply by 12.6 yuan from the peak on the 20th. If there are no unexpected changes, it may be stable for the time being. The key to the future still depends on whether actual sales improve.</p>
<p>Speculative yarn buyers are panicking and cutting their losses.</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for speculative yarn saw a slight improvement in sentiment due to the rebound in imported cotton. All months rose by one yuan. The second round of trading saw a slight drop. The third round of trading saw a sharp rise of four yuan in near-month Osaka Grade 3 yarn and two yuan in far-month yarn, boosting morale and causing a further rise of five or six jiao. By the time the market closed, news that yarn sales were sluggish and customer purchases were weak caused the market to decline, and all months rose by only three, six, nine jiao to one yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw sluggish spot yarn transactions and speculative buyers cutting their losses, causing a sudden surge in the decline. Near-term contracts fell by two yuan, and far-term contracts also fell by one and a half yuan. After the second round of trading, near-month contracts remained weak and broke through the 220-yuan mark. Far-month contracts were better. The spot yarn trade was too sluggish. As a result, November contracts fell by 2.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and far-term contracts fell by one to two yuan. It is recorded that Juxing sold 3,300 bales, Jinchang 1,550 bales, Zhenda 850 bales, Shenji 1,000 bales, Yicheng 1,400 bales, Hengyi 3,000 bales, Senkang 3,500 bales, and Changfeng 4,150 bales. Zhunyuda bought 2,200 bales, Minghua 1,850 bales, Fengtai 2,600 bales, Wangtai Yu 1,550 bales, Taichang 1,400 bales, Runkang 1,550 bales, Heyu 1,350 bales, Yu Chang 2,300 bales, Dachangcheng 1,200 bales, Jinkang 800 bales, and Dachang 850 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 696,80</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Only to Inland and Guangdong</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were mediocre. A total of 360 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices ranging from 221 to 222 yuan, and thread prices falling by 3 to 4 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 325 Guangdong 35</p>

<p>The cotton market continued to decline, and market sentiment became increasingly weak. This is because arrivals from all routes are gradually increasing, and goods received last month are also being cashed out. The spot market for November and December remains loose, and small investors are alarmed, causing market prices to decline directly. However, China cotton has rebounded yesterday.</p>
<p>Speculative Cotton Falls Another Half Yuan</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for speculative cotton saw a slight increase in American cotton, but market sentiment did not appear very strong. Near-month contracts rose slightly by 0.15 yuan, mid-month contracts fell by 0.15 yuan, and far-month contracts remained unchanged. The second round of trading saw a fall in near-month contracts and a rise of 0.1 yuan in far-month contracts. By the time the third round closed, the slump in the yarn market weakened market sentiment, and all months fell sharply by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. As a result, all months fell by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a surge in the decline of near-term contracts, with many sellers pushing prices down by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, dragging far-month contracts into the whirlpool. The second and third rounds of trading remained weak and sluggish. By the time the market closed, there was a slight recovery. As a result, all months fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Shenji sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Juxing sold 6,200 dan, Zhenda 4,400 dan, Heyu 6,700 dan, Renfeng 5,500 dan, Weifeng 14,600 dan, Fukang 2,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,000 dan, Hengyi 7,100 dan, Yuan 2,600 dan, Yongda 5,200 dan, and Xinchang 1,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with unfavorable news from Liverpool. Foreign merchants closed out their long positions, causing a drop of 2 to 5 points for each month. Afterwards, there was limited buying in December futures, and frost in Oklahoma caused the stock market to react, pushing prices back up. The situation in the market, after a round of long position closings, has become more stable, and the current market price is consistent with a cotton harvest of around 12 million bales. Short sellers are willing to cover, but buyers are generally hesitant. The weather forecast predicts clouds in the east, with unstable weather, light frost in North Carolina, clear skies in the central region, and clouds in the west. Before the close, long positions were closed out, and short covering and inter-dealer buying occurred. Spot prices rose 15 points, and futures prices rose 10 to 16 points. English cotton spot prices fell 13 points, and futures prices fell 12 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to old long position closings and futures traders selling, but later strengthened due to short covering and spot traders buying. Pirgaon fell 1 to 2.25 rupees, Oomra fell 2.25 rupees, and Broach fell 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 27th):</p>

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was flat and weak. Speculative yarn and cotton once retreated, eventually trending downstream, making it difficult to boost morale, resulting in a stagnant cloth market. Profitable holders of goods continued to dump them at low prices. However, the sales performance of various customer routes was still good. Those in Shanghai who had placed orders for various cloths were particularly eager to pick up their spot goods. Factory production remained extremely tight, no less so than before. Therefore, the factories' attitudes remained quite calm. White goods, coarse cloth, and heavyweight goods remained scarce. Recently, small amounts of military uniforms have been added in various places, but there are no spot goods available to meet the demand, and the market remains firm. The supply of lightweight coarse cloth on the market has gradually increased, with slight inventory. However, the demand for 11-pound and 9-pound coarse cloth for jacket linings is increasing daily, and the market decline is also minimal. Recently, the market price of fine twills has been exceptionally high because the uniforms for civil training in various places this year all use dyed twill cloth. Therefore, the demand is huge, and the cost of soft fine cloth is also high (3 or 4 jiao per bolt). Yesterday, customer groups continued to ship goods in large quantities. Small amounts of new dyed goods were also sold, and prices were also stable. The ports of Changsha, Hankou, Anqing, Wuhu, and Jiujiang were the busiest, while the sales of goods to the southern routes of Guangdong, Yunnan, and Fujian were also smooth. Most of the goods shipped were pre-ordered, with only slight additions of fine and coarse cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Domestic Woolen Fabrics Are in Particularly Strong Demand <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Creating unprecedented new records.</p>
<p>A phenomenon after rural areas have improved</p>
<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric trade was very prosperous, and the trade association's trend was excellent. The supply of most domestic woolen fabrics could not meet the demand, resulting in prices rising one after another. Although the raw material of woolen yarn has risen sharply, the market progress this autumn, abundant agricultural harvests, lack of inventory in various ports, and increased purchasing power of customers are all major reasons. Therefore, if there are no changes in the current situation, the woolen fabric market should make greater progress. Yesterday, Dalong, Zhanghua plain serge, Zhanghua Renli uniform flannel, Xiexin straight tribute Western suit flannel all saw increases. Lianyi sold six or seven tenths without any goods. The briskness of the market can be said to be an unprecedented new record for domestic woolen fabrics.</p>

<p>The gold market still showed signs of weakness yesterday. Large players continued to wait and see. Under the wavering of speculators, there was an oversupply, resulting in a continued fall of 1.3 yuan. The overseas silver market, both in England and the United States, was flat in the early morning. The forward silver price in Montreux was unchanged and up to 70 points. Exchange rates opened flat and closed higher. The price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were flat in both England and the United States. The customs gold unit was unchanged. The listed standard price for speculative gold remained at 1156.8 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower, but immediately failed to recover. Speculators closed out their positions, leading to a surge in selling. The short positions took advantage of the low prices to cover slightly, making it still easy to pull up. The HSBC's listed exchange rates revealed that England and the United States were flat, and the silver balance tax was unchanged. The situation in the afternoon still showed an oversupply, and the downward trend restarted. Although there was still a rebound after the fall, the will of the large players was dispersed, making it easy for strength to be shown. The trend at noon was still weak. The situation in the half-day market will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1156.2 yuan, down 0.2 yuan from the previous close. Shenkang Hengyu Qiafeng Yongxiang Feng sold off, falling to 5.3 yuan. Dadecheng Tongfeng Heng slightly advanced, rising to 5.9 yuan. The HSBC's listed exchange rates were flat in both England and the United States, and the silver balance tax was also flat.

Ji Chishan spot trading houses Shengyuan Yong sold dozens of taels, with a premium of 13 yuan. The buying price was a premium of 8 yuan. Tianjin goods were a premium of 11.25 yuan, but there were few sellers. The swap period turned calm.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was limited. In summary, Fuxing Yongda Decheng Heng Chu Kuan Taiheng Yuanmao Yong and others were on the buying side, while Yida Xiangfeng Shengyuan Yong Qialan Yong Shenkang and others were on the selling side. Yuanmao Yong first advanced and then exited, while Dadecheng exited and then re-entered.</p>
<p>The situation in the second half of the day was even weaker. The morning opening was 1156.2 yuan, which was the highest price. The afternoon closing was 1155.1 yuan, with the lowest price at 1155 yuan, a fluctuation of 1.2 yuan. As a result, it fell by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous performance.

<h3 id="e189">Securities- Retail Investors Are Buying More and Selling Less- Public Bonds Hover and Show Firmness- December Futures Have Already Debuted and Begun Trading Yesterday <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation returned to hovering. December futures have already begun trading. Although all contracts were fully opened, trading was extremely sparse. Most groups are waiting and watching. Major players rarely entered or exited the market. Retail investors are slightly embellishing the market. The spot market is firm, remaining in a hovering state. The diplomatic situation is still brewing and waiting for changes. At this critical juncture, both the long and short positions have a sense of not knowing what to do. The market situation is also in a state of uncertainty. The future still depends on the situation for a turnaround. The process yesterday was generally hovering with firmness. There were more transactions in the morning, and market prices also saw a slight increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan due to retail investors buying more and selling less. The 4th contract first advanced and then exited. Both rounds of trading saw a slight increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Trading in the afternoon was extremely slow. The opening price was only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan for Class E contracts. Although all the remaining contracts were opened item by item, the market price absolutely did not fluctuate. The closing price also did not fluctuate for most contracts, with a few slightly better by around 0.1 yuan. As a result, excluding the new December contracts, the November contracts were mostly slightly better by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was only 219.500 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, again presented a consistent decline. Chicago's quotations for foreign wheat were good by 0.1 yuan, while Canada's were good by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan, respectively. When the prices were opened, market sentiment was initially calm, but market sentiment was not as strong as before. Because the standard decline was considerable, the factory was gradually selling off to hedge, and the number of chips was relatively abundant. The reason for the major decline in market sentiment was the rumor that there was a telegram about Australian wheat, with the asking price being approximately 2.5 yuan. Although it has not yet approached the price, market sentiment is naturally weak. Therefore, both near and distant terms consistently declined. By the time the afternoon opened, near-term market sentiment was still sluggish. The November contract fell to a low of 3.68 yuan, down 0.1 yuan from the previous week's high. Later, outside investors bought in, and market sentiment stabilized. The final result was a decline of 0.01 to 0.04 yuan. After observation, the reason for the decline was that it gradually approached the foreign wheat and the market has reached its peak. Therefore, a storm is inevitable.</p>

<p>Future Market Correction Leads to Slight Stabilization</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, at the morning opening, showed signs of sluggishness in all months. Although foreign wheat quotations continued to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 jiao, the weakening of wheat prices in Dalian softened sentiment. Furthermore, due to high prices, bullish sentiment gradually decreased. Rumors of Australian wheat offers at 8.5 yuan per picul further loosened sentiment, causing prices to fall by 5 to 6 fen compared to the previous day. However, at the afternoon opening, the decline continued initially by 3 to 4 fen. After the second session, as sentiment gradually stabilized, short covering pushed prices up by 5 to 6 fen, resulting in a final rise of only about 6 fen for nearby contracts and 1.3 fen for distant contracts. The spot wheat market remained stable, but standard "Lian" wheat has remained unchanged for two days, so factories have become less eager to purchase. Consequently, Shandong wheat was quoted at 6.05 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 6.05 yuan, "Jue" wheat at 6 yuan, Chongming wheat at 5.82 yuan ("Jue" at 7 jiao), and Huangqiao wheat at 5.81 yuan. Shen Da handled 4,000 bags, it was said.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various regions totaled nearly 40, amounting to over 8,000 shi of goods. Demand from out-of-town buyers continued to be strong, with nearly 3,000 bags of new "bo" rice and 700 to 800 bags of thick new japonica rice being purchased by Qingyan, Tianjin, and other regions. However, the local market remained ordinary, making it difficult to boost market activity. As a result, thick new japonica rice remained stable. High-quality varieties such as "Lu Zhong Bai Ge" were able to hold their ground, while mid-range goods fell by nearly a jiao. "Du Jian" rice, however, was in high demand among retailers, continuing to rise by approximately one jiao. "Yang Jian" rice also rose by one jiao due to the trend. There was no fixed standard for thick and thin broken japonica rice. New "yin" rice, due to strong arrivals and sluggish sales, fell by a significant 3 to 4 jiao.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the 31 to 32 sources from various river ports saw ordinary market activity. Broken japonica rice and new japonica rice showed flat and sluggish trends. "Lu Zhong Yao Shi" rice was in strong demand among buyers, and market prices were firm. "Ke Jian" rice remained stable. With the exception of "yin" rice, which was marginally lower than the original price, the prices of other rice varieties also showed signs of weakness.</p>

<p>Price Rises by 1.5 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags of machine-milled indica rice arrived, and sales were even more active, resulting in a gradually improving market situation. Sales of machine-milled rice were active both north and south, particularly to Henan and Guangdong/Shantou. Henan had previously made purchases, and demand was even greater yesterday, especially from the Guide area of Henan. Shantou, Guangdong, and the local market also actively purchased machine-milled rice. Consequently, the price of machine-milled rice continued to rise by 1 to 1.5 jiao. Sales of brown rice to Guangdong were slightly weaker, and prices only continued to rise by 3 to 5 fen. Throughout the day, 6,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 7,000 bags of Hunan rice, 180 bags of Taizhou rice, 500 bags of Shashi rice, and 100 bags of factory "xi" were sold.</p>

<p>Japanese Continuously Searching Overseas, Futures Orders Possible Only After Five or Six Months</p>
<p>Black iron sheets (specifically, the sheets used for black-headed nails) are essential for products such as paint cans and ironware. However, previously, due to abundant inventories and continuous arrivals, the market trend was weak and lackluster, and standard quotations were also very soft, with each picul selling listlessly at 5.4 to 5.5 jiao. In recent days, overseas telegrams have indicated that this type of product has been purchased by Japan, and deliveries to China may only be possible for futures orders placed five to six months from now. This has caused panic among local manufacturers who need this product, leading to frantic searches. However, after a month of scouring the market, supplies have become scarce, causing prices to jump repeatedly. The price per picul has risen to 6.4 yuan. It is said that there are still no large quantities of spot goods available, and buyers from Hubei, Tianjin, Sichuan, and Jiangxi also inquired about the product yesterday, suggesting that the market situation is unlikely to ease in the short term.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants' Association set prices, keeping the original prices for "er si liang bai" and "si ba jiu hao dong bai" unchanged. The factory prices for "Mian Bai Zhen" and "Da Hua Jin Xin" grade 1 were 20.5 yuan, with others following the previous discounts. Regarding grade-numbered goods, a buyer from a certain region offered 13.9 jiao for over a hundred bags of "Yu Ji Ti Qing," and 13.5 to 13.4 jiao for remaining bags of "Huanggang Qing Bai," with other miscellaneous "Qing" sugars seeing some sporadic transactions.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation held its second weekly auction for Guangdong sugar. The total amount set was over 9,000 "ju". Bidding was spirited, with 680 bags of "Shunde Factory Five Rams Coarse White" being sold at 21.5 yuan, 100 bags of "You Tou" at 21.3 jiao, and 185 bags of "Fu" at 20.09 jiao. The original price for city-produced sand sugar was not met, with a total of 1,065 bags being sold.</p>

<p>The sales of daylilies have gradually become more active recently. A total of 500 to 600 bags were purchased by Quanzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Taiwan buyers. Buyers from Guangdong are shipping directly to Zhenjiang, causing the market to tighten. Currently, top-grade "zhuang" daylilies are quoted at 27 yuan, "Daxing" daylilies at 25.3 jiao, and "xiang zhuang" daylilies at 24.2 jiao, while "jue" daylilies vary from 22 to 23 yuan. Quoted prices are higher than before, showing signs of further increases.</p>

<p>Yushan Fine Teas Resume Activity</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Trade Association yesterday, after several telegraphic exchanges between various foreign firms and overseas buyers regarding the green tea market, the market situation has slightly improved. A large quantity of Pingshui teas have been sold in recent days, and a considerable amount of various fine teas have also been traded yesterday. Jardine Matheson purchased 780 boxes of fine teas from various regions, including Yushan and Suian teas priced at 31 to 34.5 yuan, Huizhou and ordinary Tunxi teas priced at 49 to 52 yuan. Kin Lung sold 300 boxes of Phoenix teas from American plantations, priced at 34 yuan, and over 100 boxes of Xiu teas, priced at 16 yuan. Bochang purchased over 100 boxes of Tunzhen teas, priced at 62 yuan, and 200 boxes of Xiu teas, priced at 27 yuan. On the market, low-grade fine teas are traded more frequently, and the existing stock of these teas is said to be scarce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning the green tea market this month, previously, due to favorable foreign exchange rates, high-grade goods from Tunxi, Mouyuan, and other regions were easily sold, while medium- and low-grade goods were largely滞滞 stagnant. Recently, with the devaluation of the French franc, the cost of transporting Chinese tea to Morocco has suddenly increased by more than 20 percent. Meanwhile, the prices of teas from Yushan, Kaihua, and other regions in the market have also fallen to extremely low levels. As a result, low-grade green teas have recently shown signs of recovery. Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Kin Lung, and other firms have purchased over 600 boxes, with prices on the market ranging from 31 to 34 yuan, which is considered very low.

<p>— Shu Ying</p>
<p>－The First Explorer to Circumnavigate the World－</p>
<p>When we open a world map, we can see a very prominent strait at the southernmost tip of South America, called the Strait of Magellan. Magellan was originally a person's name, and using a person's name as the name of a strait, everyone who sees it will probably have some doubts and believe that this strait must have a history. Below, we will talk about the origin of this strait and the great explorer who discovered it.</p>
<p>Originally, people used to think that the Earth was not spherical. It was not until Columbus discovered the New World that it was proven that the Earth was indeed spherical. However, Columbus mistakenly believed that the New World he discovered was part of India. He imagined the Earth to be too small. He did not know that the island of San Salvador he discovered was another continent in the West, separated by a vast ocean. The other side of the ocean was India in the East.</p>
<p>However, what the Portuguese Magellan saw was different from Columbus. He believed that the place Columbus reached was definitely not the Orient. There must be a new continent between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, blocking the way. To reach the Orient, one must pass through this new continent. Therefore, later, under this belief, coupled with his courage and spirit of exploration, Magellan began his life of exploration. Although he went through many twists and turns, and even lost his life in this exploration, he finally proved that his vision was correct, and it was his party that first completed the circumnavigation of the world.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, Magellan was Portuguese, born in 1470 AD, twenty years younger than Columbus, so he was only twelve years old when Columbus reached the west coast of America. After growing up, he served as a volunteer in the Portuguese fleet, so he was particularly proficient in navigation, geography, and practical warfare. Later, due to various reasons, he left Portugal and served in the Spanish royal family. Soon, Magellan gained the trust of the King of Spain, who agreed to help him realize his ambition of exploration.</p>
<p>Magellan was overjoyed after receiving the help of the King of Spain. He led 250 people on five sailing ships and set off from Spain on September 20, 1519 AD. The two larger sailing ships were about 120 tons each, and the other three were smaller. After setting off, they traveled day and night, and finally reached the new continent of South America on November 29. The natives here saw Magellan and his team coming and regarded them as gods. They regarded the things they brought as treasures and exchanged livestock and all kinds of food for small bells, knives, iron axes, and so on.</p>
<p>They continued to travel south along the coast, passing through many places that no one had ever been to before. Later, because the weather turned bad, they had to temporarily stop advancing and spent the winter in a place called St. Julian Bay, thus extending the scheduled date. Magellan feared that the food supply would not be enough and that there would be danger in navigation later, so he decided to ration the food, stipulating the amount of food for each crew member. Unfortunately, some crew members were jealous of Magellan's achievements and deliberately made things difficult for him. His name was Cartagena. He led a part of the crew to oppose the distribution of food. Quite a few crew members were deceived by him and planned to divide into three ships and leave Magellan. Fortunately, Magellan discovered this dangerous plot in advance. With his extraordinary talents and means, he broke the conspiracy and suppressed the opposition to the distribution of food. After careful interrogation, many who were willing to repent were allowed to return to the ship. Only Cartagena and a few others still opposed and refused to repent, so when their ship set off, these people were left on the island, not allowed to return with them.</p>
<p>After the rebellion ended, Magellan ordered the ship to set sail again and continue southward. However, the coastline was endless, and there was no trace of the place they wanted to reach. But Magellan never despaired. He bravely moved forward and finally, on October 21, 1520, finished the coastline and discovered the strait. This is the Strait of Magellan that we see on the map. Magellan finally received this reward with a spirit of perseverance and hard work. At this time, the sailors were also overjoyed. Some even advised Magellan to turn back from now on, saying that since they had discovered the strait, they had already made a great contribution to the country. But Magellan still insisted on moving forward, passing through the strait, and the ship reached the vast ocean, the climate was mild, and the waves were calm. This is the Pacific Ocean. They thought that by passing through the Strait of Magellan, they would soon reach the Eastern Hemisphere, but they did not know that the ship had entered the ocean again. However, Magellan never lost heart and continued to sail. After another month or two, their food was exhausted, and the water was turbid. They were about to resort to gnawing on the canvas when, fortunately, the crew members were inspired by Magellan's heroic courage, and there was no fear or complaint. The five ships still bravely sailed forward. However, because life was too hard, and the water was not clean, more and more people died of illness every day, so they decided to rest on the island of Rateron. After a few days, they continued to move forward. In a few days, they reached the Philippine Islands. The Filipinos thought that they were all Eastern countries, but in fact, they came from Portugal and were travelers from Western countries, so it was further proven that the Earth is round.</p>
<p>Magellan's success was entirely due to his perseverance and indomitable will. He overcame all difficulties, even rationing food, which proves the saying that "where there is a will, there is a way." No matter who it is, as long as they have determination and can endure hardship, I think they will definitely achieve something.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, although Magellan had such great achievements, opened a new record for traveling around the world, and became a great man with immortal fame in history, he later preached Christianity in the Philippines because of his belief in Jesus, which aroused the opposition of the natives. As a result of the natives' sabotage in various ways, he disregarded his own small number of people and decided to conquer the natives by force. He only relied on the fact that his weapons were better than those of the natives, so he boldly led more than sixty people to fight against more than a thousand natives. As a result, they were outnumbered and defeated by the natives. During the retreat, Magellan was finally wounded by a poisonous spear from the natives. Although Magellan also repelled dozens of natives, he was eventually killed by the natives because of the disparity in numbers. If this great explorer of the century had not preached, he would have been able to return to Spain safely with his companions. Later, his companions arrived safely in Spain on September 6, 1522, amidst a grand welcome. Although few were left, the cause of circumnavigating the world was thus successful.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Fang Clan's Disaster in the "Jingnan Campaign" <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Lu</p>
<p>Whenever a country is in turmoil, loyal ministers and martyrs will always emerge, sacrificing their lives for righteousness and inspiring the people and reviving the national soul. But the authorities always use high-pressure tactics to try to stop this fierce action, and the result is the development of all kinds of cruel tragedies.</p>
<p>Zhu Yuanzhang, the Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, rose up as a commoner, drove back the Hu people, and ruled China, which was also prosperous and the people lived in peace. It was not until May of the thirty-first year of Hongwu that Taizu contracted a serious illness. A month later, he died of illness. His will stated that the throne should be inherited by his嫡grandson Yunwen, because Yunwen was intelligent and filial, and the world had already turned to him, and it was customary to follow the嫡line. When the嫡son died, it was the嫡grandson's turn, so Yunwen immediately ascended the throne as instructed, and the following year was the first year of Jianwen. This was Emperor Hui.</p>
<p>At that time, Emperor Hui had an uncle named Di, who was naturally fierce and violent. Seeing that Emperor Hui's father had died early, he had the intention of usurping the throne. Taizu also knew his intentions, so he sent him to Beiping and made him the Prince of Yan, thinking that in this way, even if he had evil intentions, his power would be far away and could not be realized. Who knew that after the Prince of Yan went north, he trained his troops and dominated one side. Not long after Taizu died, he used the excuse of opposing Emperor Hui's advice to use Fang Xiaoru and others to change the official system, and under the guise of "Jingnan," he raised troops to invade the south.</p>
<p>The Prince of Yan fought all the way to Nanjing and entered the Jinchuan Gate directly. The capital was captured, and a fire broke out in the palace, killing many people. Emperor Hui's whereabouts were unknown. The Prince of Yan, fearing that the people would not submit, ordered the queen's remains to be obtained, prepared for burial with courtesy, and also said that Emperor Hui had died by self-immolation. He established himself as emperor, named Chengzu, which was in June of the fourth year of Jianwen. In July, Chengzu changed that year to the thirty-fifth year of Hongwu, abolished the new system, restored the old system, and the following year was the first year of Yongle. Chengzu thought at the time that doing so was in accordance with the will of heaven and the people, and he did not care about the criticism of later generations.</p>
<p>Here, let's talk about Mr. Fang Xiaoru again. He was from Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province. His father, Keqin, was a good official during the Hongwu period. Xiaoru was intelligent and different from others from a young age, and was known as "Little Hanzi." When he grew up, he had a dignified character and profound knowledge. Ming Taizu called him "Zhuangshi." The King of Shu Xian also hired him as a teacher for the世子, and named his书舍 "Zhengxue Lu." When Emperor Hui ascended the throne, he was summoned to be a侍讲, and all major policies were discussed with him before they were implemented.</p>
<p>After Chengzu usurped Emperor Hui's throne by violence, he listened to Yao Guangxiao's words, thinking that Fang Xiaoru was the seed of scholars in the world and could not be killed. Therefore, when Chengzu ascended the throne, he summoned him and ordered him to draft the诏文. Xiaoru was very sad and indignant because Emperor Hui was forced to commit suicide and the throne was usurped, so he wore filial piety clothes all over his body and cried to the palace. At that time, Chengzu comforted him: "Why is先生so sad? I am just learning from the Duke of Zhou to assist King Cheng!" Xiaoru said angrily after listening</p>
<p>"Where is King Cheng?"</p>
<p>"He burned himself to death."</p>
<p>"Then why not establish King Cheng's son?"</p>
<p>"The country depends entirely on the长君."</p>
<p>"Then why not establish King Cheng's brother?"</p>
<p>"This is Teng's family matter, don't you interfere,"</p>
<p>At this time, Chengzu became angry and taught his subordinates to hand over the笔墨纸札to Xiaoru, saying: "Shaowen must be drafted by先生!" Xiaoru thought that this was a matter of betraying great righteousness and could not be subdued by might, so he threw the pen on the ground, and cried and scolded: "... You can kill me, but I will not覃诏!" King Yan was unwilling to give up and said angrily: "How can you die so cheaply, I will also destroy your ten clans!" He forced him to write, Xiaoru knew that the situation was like a tiger on the road and could not be stopped. He simply wrote the four characters "Yan thief usurped the throne" and handed them up. Chengzu looked at them, and it was true that "anger rises from the heart, and evil grows from the胆." He immediately ordered the guards to arrest him and put him in prison. Later, he was tied to the market and beheaded together with Shangshu Qi Tai and Taichangqing Huang Zicheng. When Xiaoru was executed, he died with great courage and was not sad at all, and wrote a poem of绝命词:</p>
<p>"Heaven sends chaos, who knows the reason?</p>
<p>奸臣 gets his way, and the country is used like you.</p>
<p>Loyal ministers are angry, blood and tears are flowing,</p>
<p>Take this to seek殉, what else can you ask for?</p>
<p>Alas, alas, may you not allow me."</p>
<p>At that time, he was only forty-six years old.</p>
<p>His wife, Zheng Shi, and two sons - Zhongxian Zhongyu - all hanged themselves to death when they heard the news, and two daughters - Zhen and Shu - also committed suicide by throwing themselves into the Qinhuai River.</p>
<p>When Xiaoru's younger brother, Xiaoyou, was arrested and executed, Xiaoru saw him and couldn't help but feel sad and shed tears, but Xiaoyou chanted a jue句:</p>
<p>"Why does阿兄weep 澘澘?</p>
<p>Taking righteousness and becoming benevolence is here,</p>
<p>After the領表柱頭 for thousands of years,</p>
<p>The旅魂 still returns to 家山."</p>
<p>How tragic! There must be a brother if there is a brother, that's really right.</p>
<p>His friends and students were designated as "Fang's Party" by the authorities, and it is not known how many were遗謫or executed, such as Tong Bolü being transferred to Lulong, Zhang You's five brothers being sent to the border guards, Zheng Gongzhi, the assistant inspector of Shaanxi, and Lin Xiyou being sentenced to death, Lu Yuanzhi, the少卿of Taichang, and his brother Lu Yuanpu being滅家, and进士Zhang You and俞尹璋 also committed suicide because of this. ...</p>
<p>The decree of灭族 arrived at先生's hometown - Ninghai - and the Ninghai County authorities did not dare to neglect it. They quickly sent troops to search and arrest, which really made ghosts cry and gods howl, and chickens and dogs were not spared. A total of 827 people of his clan were killed one after another, and the corpses piled up into mountains and the blood flowed into rivers. No one dared to clean them up. At that time, there was a man named Ma Zitong, who, moved by righteousness and indignation, threw these corpses into a well and committed suicide by jumping into the well. Later, the water in this well was red for many days. During the Wanli period, Magistrate Wu Lai built a pavilion on this well and inscribed it with the four characters "义井忠泉." Now this Yijing Pavilion is still on Dajie Street in Ninghai City, and everyone who passes by expresses condolences and admiration.</p>
<p>At that time, anyone who hid Xiaoru's articles was sentenced to death. His fellow countryman, Mr. Zhang Pu, was reported by Yang Shan, the county序班of Ningbo, for collecting Fang's collection. Chengzu was very angry and arrested him. His younger brother, Zongjian, also followed him and cried and beat the "登闻鼓," willing to die and was also arrested. During the trial, Zhang Pu said. "Xiaoru was killed for being loyal to the country, and most of his articles praised the ways of the former kings and cannot be regarded as evil!" The judge passed these words to Chengzu, who became even more angry and immediately ordered him to be taken to the market and beheaded. Zhang Pu's face did not change when he was about to die, and he chanted poems calmly, and Zongjian also chanted poems in harmony. They were killed together. (The currently circulating collection of articles was copied and passed down by Wang Tú.)</p>
<p>Because everyone was afraid of the Party's disaster and was afraid of being implicated, no one dared to clean up Fang Xiaoru's remains. His表侄 Zheng Xun planned to take the remains to his hometown for burial with his student Wang Tú in Pujiang and Jinling, but was known by the authorities and was arrested and imprisoned. Later, because Chengzu accidentally thought of Wang Tú's grandfather, Wang Yi, who was a loyal minister of the former dynasty, he was specially pardoned, and Mr. Fang's remains were still hastily buried outside Jushimen in Nanjing, where he was executed.</p>
<p>When Fang's clan was滅族ed, everyone sighed that Fang's clan had no descendants and was about to be 절嗣. Fortunately, Xiaoru's second son Yi was hidden by Wei Tan, the former刑部尚齐邑尉, and thus passed down a lineage. At that time, there was a秀才 Yu Xuekui, who was from Ninghai, and was very happy to learn of this news, but he was somewhat suspicious of Wei Ze and did not dare to recognize him directly. He pretended to be a madman and begged for food in the Jinling market. One day, he met Wei Ze in the corner of the city and sang wildly:</p>
<p>"In the past, Yurang was not a pure minister, but he was willing to swallow炭 and lacquer his body.</p>
<p>It is laughable that the执政者 of today叩头to the new master and beg for grace纶."</p>
<p>Also said:</p>
<p>"Do not be ashamed of the Zhou Su, but 偷生. Shouyang's节义is like 萍.</p>
<p>向日 都俞 now turn against each other,区区still willing to emulate 程婴."</p>
<p>Wei Ze understood his meaning and deliberately shouted, "Madman, get out!" Two days later, he met him in the market again and continued to sing 佯. Wei Ze secretly wrote a letter to him and entrusted him with Xiaoru's manuscript and Fang Xian. Xuekui took Fang Xian by sea and hid on an island. After a month, he saw that there was no movement, so he walked along the coast to Qingcun, Songjiang, and fished every day to make a living. Later, he inquired that Yu Yunren and Ren Mian in Huating County were Xiaoru's 斗生, so Xuekui entered the city to visit and handed over Wei Ze's letter. The two were surprised and happy to see it, and tried to arrange them. Because the ban on parties was strict, they changed their surname to Yu and moved to Baisha里,耕 night reading, Fang's descendants, under the protection of Yu's righteous men, lived in Huating County.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang sacrificed for justice, and all the martyrs慷慨ly died for upholding justice. What kind of inspiration does this give us at this time of national crisis!</p>

<h3 id="e200">Talking about Magazines <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xingzhi</p>
<p>－With Two Demands－</p>
<p>Books are the food for people to seek knowledge, and all modern people need them. Not to mention adults, even children need them, so the level of culture of a country can be judged by looking at the quality and quantity of its publications.</p>
<p>However, the scope of books is too broad, including specialized research books, school textbooks, and casual novels, etc., which cannot be fully discussed at one time. What I want to talk about now is magazines.</p>
<p>The so-called magazine actually encompasses everything. Because of its different nature, there are specialized ones, general ones, those that focus on literature and art, those that focus on economics or politics, and even those that are known for cartoons or曲线美. The various types are really a glimpse of the world.</p>
<p>But no matter how many forms there are and how complex the types are, they can be roughly divided into three categories: soft, hard, and a combination of hard and soft.</p>
<p>Those that generally focus on academic research are usually called hard, those that focus on leisure are called soft, and those that provide knowledge and have a recreational nature are called hard-soft publications. However, there are few absolutely hard ones, and the absolutely soft or hard-soft ones account for the majority.</p>
<p>In terms of the time of publication, there are two types: regular publications and irregular publications. Regular ones include annual publications, quarterly publications, bi-monthly publications, monthly publications, semi-monthly publications, weekly publications, etc. Most of the irregular ones are group publications of academic societies, and most of them are research-oriented.</p>
<p>In the past, magazines, especially during the turbulent revolutionary wave, often talked about politics, and most of them contained a nature of promotion and propaganda. Recently, politics has become slightly more stable, and the trend of academic research is more popular, so specialized research-oriented publications have slightly emerged, which cannot be said to be a gratifying phenomenon. In fact, it is also a necessary phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, the world situation is in a turbulent wave, and international changes are changing rapidly, so publications that study international situations are still very developed, which is also promoted by the times.</p>
<p>Although academic knowledge is needed by everyone, the education system under capitalism deprives the poor of the right to enjoy medicine and reading. In response to this need, there are various magazines that help self-study, such as "Reading Youth" and "Reading Monthly."</p>
<p>The world economy is in recession, rural areas are bankrupt, and the number of unemployed people in society is increasing day by day, so people want to find a sideline to make a living, so there are so-called "Rural Sideline Monthly" and "Chicken Raising Magazine," etc.</p>
<p>Young people are wandering on the wrong path and mostly like to read literary works as spiritual comfort. The various novels and magazines published by the Creation Society in the past have won the welcome of many young people, which is clear proof. Therefore, literary publications are still on the road to prosperity and development, such as "Writer," "Literary Artist," "Midstream," "Translation," and "Literature" and "Literary Quarterly," etc., which seem to be emerging one after another.</p>
<p>There are also publications that are aimed at people, such as "Middle School Student" published by Kaiming, "Youth Circle" published by Beixin, and "Youth Monthly" published by Zhengzhong, which are specifically for middle school students; "Education Magazine," "Education Circle," and "Elementary Education," etc., which are specifically for the education sector; and those for elementary school students are even more numerous, but most of them focus on both pictures and texts.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been so-called humorous magazines. Frankly speaking, these humorous magazines also have their own merits, but humor should not be taken as a serious matter. "Cosmic Wind" and "Analects" are representatives of this type of magazine.</p>
<p>From the branch of humor, combining revolutionary anecdotes and talking about literature and history, Yijing is well-known for its sales.</p>
<p>People either go upward or downward, but going upward is like sailing against the current, which cannot be done without great certainty, so it is easy to go downward. Carnal sensuality is the easiest to seduce people; laughing and scolding are the easiest to win people's favor, so in order to cater to the preferences of the times, there are various boring publications. Full of curvy sensuality, nude images of women, "The Unofficial Biography of Mr. Wang," "Cartoon Circle," "Cartoon World," etc., are endless. This is also the psychology of seeking comfort in boredom. Those who are in tune with this include dance halls on the sea with five tickets for one yuan, girl singing and dancing troupes, massage parlors, and indescribable toys, etc.</p>
<p>Hard publications are dedicated to academic research or serve as a kind of knowledge lock. They are beneficial to read, but unfortunately, there are too few of these valuable publications now.</p>
<p>Although there is a difference between soft and hard in terms of nature, it is best to soften the hard ones. "Historical Essays" and "Scientific Essays" are the creations of this technique. In fact, why only "history" and "science" like this? "Politics," "economics," and others can also be like this.</p>
<p>Since it is called a magazine, it should be diverse. But维者is not completely unsystematic, that is, it should be fresh and lively. The materials should be in response to the environment and seasons, the arrangement should be as lively as possible, and the cover插画should be changed from time to time, so that people will not feel familiar at first sight and cannot arouse interest at all.</p>
<p>Although soft publications are designed to please people, they will become boring after a long time. I think the soft ones can be slightly hardened, in other words, they should have knowledge-based text and pictures.</p>
<p>Regular publications were mostly monthly publications at first, but recently the most popular ones are semi-monthly publications, and weekly publications are determined. If the period is too long, it is like classics, if the period is too short, the length will be thin, and it will be meaningless to see it at a glance. Therefore, semi-monthly publications are more suitable for softer ones, and monthly publications are more suitable for harder ones.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, most of the magazines in our country could not be published on time. Now, all magazines can be published on time. Some have even been published early. But some still cannot be published on schedule, so we should strive for accuracy.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing about magazines is being腰斩ed. It is very disappointing for readers when the inaugural issue is published, or five or ten issues are published and then the publication is stopped.</p>
<p>Although there are many magazines in China recently, there are still no magazines with very substantial content. For example, Japan's "Central Public Opinion," "Gaizhao," and "New Tide" are of good quality and are truly rare. Here, I hope to concentrate people and resources to run the most ideal magazine.</p>
<p>I also have one last request, that is, I hope everyone will work together to run the most popular magazine, so that everyone can understand it and everyone can enjoy it, and promote the popularization of education and improve the level of culture in the most simple and interesting text.</p>
<p>I wonder when this little wish can be realized?</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Weekly Magazine Introduced to Students <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ren</p>
<p>In the current publishing world, which is plagued by "barrenness" and "incompleteness," to find a publication that provides the most faithful reports and research for students to "guide them," I think "Chinese Student" is worth recommending.</p>
<p>Some magazines often make readers feel meaningless after reading them, and sometimes even feel extremely empty. This is clearly not the case in "Chinese Student," and it will give readers a satisfactory harvest. Naturally, the biggest reason here is that "Chinese Student" is purely aimed at the current stage of China and solves many of the students' own problems. This is the point where "Chinese Student" has succeeded!</p>
<p>Taking the most recently published Volume 3, Issue 8 as an example: after unfolding the full-page "National Boy Scouts Grand Review" facing picture, in addition to the text written by the students themselves, it also includes a special feature of "After I Got into College," and the original "Student Life in Various Places," "Student Voices," etc., are still the same as before. To give students guidance and cultivation, there are columns such as "Weekly Review," "Modern Education," "Cultivation Speech," "International Current Affairs Speech," "Literary Collection," etc. In addition, there is also a purely journalistic and interesting "School News." A publication created specifically for students with such substantial content is really worth praising and recommending. I am faithfully introducing this periodical to readers.</p>
<h3 id="e202">From "Chatting About Wind" to Humor <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Philosopher</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw some news in certain newspapers saying that another humor magazine was about to be published, named "Chatting About Wind." It said that their publishing aim was based on Mr. Lin Yutang's advocacy of "humor," and that after three or four years of painstaking effort without success, "Chatting About Wind" was to complete Mr. Lin Yutang's unfinished ambition. Of course, we readers are always welcome; at the very least, it's one more publication in the barren publishing scene.</p>
<p>"Chatting About Wind" was published on the 25th, but we saw it on the 22nd, which is somewhat good. But what about the content? The cover is printed with Mr. Lin Yutang's original manuscript, and the opening illustration is a photograph of "Welcoming" Mr. Lin's departure from the country, and the back is again Mr. Lin's handwriting. As for the text? There is Mr. Lin's "Letter to a Friend," and the "Preface" also has endless mentions of Mr. Lin. Naturally, the final "Editor's Notes" cannot avoid mentioning Mr. Lin either. How great! Mr. Yutang!</p>
<p>For such a publication, which advocates leisure, is full of scholar-official airs, and exudes an air of elegance, we cannot give it a higher evaluation. But here we cannot help but mention the humor they claim to promote. I say that "humor" cannot exist as a standalone literary work. What we can acknowledge as "humor" is a style in literature. Strictly speaking, it is just a clown in literature. However, we acknowledge that "humor" is a talent, a congenital inheritance, not a learned skill, much less something that can be forced or imitated. If "humor" is a sigh from the heart in response to unbearable suffering, then it takes the current tragic situation too lightly, too superficially.</p>
<p>As for those who advocate "humor" and revere the late Ming dynasty's Yuan Zhonglang and Yuan Xiaoxiu, that is even more of a joke! This is nothing less than ironclad proof that they regard "humor" as the resurrection of scholar-official literature!</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Student Publications</p>
<p>Details the functions, types, editing, and management of school newspapers; as well as the functions and contents of student handbooks, and how student handbooks are produced; also discusses the purpose, functions, and contents of student yearbooks.</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Music and Drama</p>
<p>Details the value of music in education, the organization of concerts, choral singing and ensembles; the organization of drama clubs, the principles of play selection, points to note before preparing for a performance, and points to note for actors during a performance.</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Speech and Debate</p>
<p>Details the importance of speech, the steps for holding speech meetings, speech judging, speech guidance, and speech research societies; the importance of debate, debate topics, the steps for holding debates, and debate judging.</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Sports</p>
<p>Details the purpose of sports, the meaning of success, the phenomena of general school extracurricular sports, equal opportunities to participate, and sports competitions.</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Social Service</p>
<p>Details civil schools, popular lectures, the New Life Movement, etc.</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Management of Extracurricular Activity Funds</p>
<p>Management of extracurricular activity funds, two appropriate accounting systems, and all aspects of a centralized accounting system.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two appendices, one is a list of major reference books in Chinese and English, and the other is a glossary of Chinese and English terms.</p>
<p>The book has a total of four hundred and thirty-six pages, each chapter is discussed in detail, forming a vast work. The publication of this book will not only transform the old concept of rote learning that has historically plagued our nation, but also serve as a pioneer for the development of new education experiments in our country. If school authorities can implement it one by one, the new education ideal of "education is life" and "school is society" will surely be realized. New educators, seeing the assertion that extracurricular activities are as important as classroom work, can fully express themselves, and their contribution to the education community of our country is self-evident.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Strategies for Restoring Weakening Marital Affection <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>…If sexual obstacles occur between couples, the family will be filled with elements of "discord," "suffering," and "weakening"… A healthy "sexual power" establishes a solid foundation for marital life, allowing for the generation of so-called pure love between the sexes… Not only that, but there will also be a risk of infertility in the future. Wise couples must pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>The union of two sexes is originally for the sake of joy and happiness, but some are completely the opposite. Not only is there no so-called joy and happiness, but the family is filled with elements of "suffering," "discord," and "weakening." What is the reason for this? Although there are various reasons, the most important one is due to sexual dysfunction between couples. Reasonably speaking, the foundation of married life lies in a healthy "sexual power." Only with a healthy "sexual power" can the so-called "love between the sexes" be generated. If a couple loses this driving force of sexual love due to physical problems, no matter how upright your appearance is or how comfortable your environment is, the marital affection will still not be satisfactory, and a feeling of weakening will inevitably be encountered unknowingly.</p>
<p>However, in the issue of sexual dysfunction, more than 80 percent belong to men. Why do men experience this phenomenon so much more? It is mostly caused by sexual neurasthenia. For example, excessive masturbation in childhood destroys the adolescent gland (i.e., the reproductive gland) that governs development and sexual function, resulting in the forced cessation of sexual organ development and the inability to achieve the main erectile force for sexual life.</p>
<p>In addition, even if it is not due to masturbation, it may be due to early marriage, abuse of sexual organs after marriage, or exposure to brothels before marriage, resulting in infection with gonorrhea, which damages the reproductive glands and cannot avoid sexual neurasthenia. Premature ejaculation, impotence, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, etc., are all symptoms induced by the above-mentioned reasons.</p>
<p>On the female side, there are only two types: frigidity and anorgasmia. The former can increase sexual neurasthenia in men, and there is a mutual causal relationship between the two.</p>
<p>However, if either party in a marriage has the above-mentioned defects, a perfect family will naturally develop flaws, resulting in many unexpected disputes and tragedies, enriching the content of newspapers. Not only that, but there will also be a risk of infertility in the future. Wise couples should pay special attention to this and deeply reflect on it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if either party in a marriage discovers the aforementioned symptoms, it is necessary to seek appropriate treatment as soon as possible to lay the foundation for a happy marriage.</p>
<p>Regarding its treatment method, according to my many years of experience and the recommendations of famous foreign doctors and hospitals, a genuine reproductive gland extract, "Reproductin," should be taken at this time.</p>
<p>"Reproductin" is made from the essence extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals, so after taking it, it can strengthen the adolescent gland, make sexual function lively and vigorous, and allow infertile people to conceive. Impotence and premature ejaculation disappear without a trace. Only those with spermatorrhea should also take "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to stop it. If there is gonorrhea, then simultaneous use of the pigment-vaccine combination preparation "Antilin" will be far more effective than other drugs.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Fundamental Therapy for Bone and Joint Pain <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Junshi, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>…The occurrence of this disease is purely due to the invasion of rheumatic blood toxins… This therapy and the two preparations are indeed effective.</p>
<p>The most unsettling thing is bone and joint pain in old age. Bone and joint pain is not necessarily a disease that only affects the elderly. However, this disease is common in older people because of weakened resistance, and the rheumatic toxins and blood toxins they suffered in their youth take the opportunity to invade. If it can be prevented early or if hygiene is appropriate, it can be avoided. Even if it occurs, it is not as severe as imagined. Conversely, it can erupt in youth. For example, weak people can feel the pain of back pain after a little hard work. Such people will undoubtedly be severely attacked by bone pain in their old age.</p>
<p>Lower back pain in young people is the guide wire for bone pain in old age, and is also a candidate for hemiplegia.</p>
<p>Every hemiplegic patient must have gone through episodes of lower back pain. If left untreated, it can spread to the bone joints throughout the body, numbness in the limbs, and spasms of the muscles. As a result, the arteries gradually harden, and the tragic stroke is then realized.</p>
<p>For this reason, one must know about the treatment of our daily diseases. First, one should know that the cause of the disease is completely due to internal rheumatic accumulation and unclean blood. Therefore, the fundamental therapy must be to take "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets," which have the effects of dispelling rheumatism, removing dampness, clearing toxins, and preventing arteriosclerosis. In my ten years in Germany, this tablet is the most recommended medicine for treating this disease. At the same time, it should be understood that "Reproductin" can make us feel full of energy and enhance our resistance. Therefore, weak people should take more of it to prevent the onset of bone pain, so it is mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>Bone Pain Common Discourse</p>
<h3 id="e206">Treatment for Bone Pain Caused by Uric Acid <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The burden of life weighs heavily on everyone in the world, causing them to toil all day long, exhausting their energy, only to get a short respite during the brief leisure hours of each day. Excessive fatigue brings excessive uric acid into the blood. These acids gradually crystallize and drill between the bone joints, like bare feet stepping on broken glass. These acid crystals rub the bone joints, causing pain that pierces the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Thus, many people who are overwhelmed by life, when they still need to struggle with fate, actually suffer from bone and joint pain. When the joints hurt, or when they work too hard, they writhe and groan in bed. When the pain is severe, needless to say, work cannot continue, and they sit idly by while their families endure hunger and cold, with no way out.</p>
<p>Modern medical experts can take decades of experience to research and invent targeted medicines as their mission. The invention of bone pain tablets by Dr. Johnston of the United States is an example of this.</p>
<p>"Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" truly have the characteristics of dispelling rheumatism, removing dampness, clearing blood toxins, preventing uric acid, and preventing arteriosclerosis. Therefore, in recent years, although thousands and hundreds of similar drugs have been introduced, none can compare with them.</p>
<p>The praise of famous doctors from various countries for this drug is widely known. According to the London "Science Magazine," Dr. Johnston, a medical scientist who has dedicated his life to helping people, has been able to cover his own brainpower and conduct countless definitive experiments, creating this tablet that is truly effective. In England alone, hundreds of thousands of sufferers are cured by this special bone pain tablet every year. It is recognized as the only good medicine for treating bone pain.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Nocturnal Emission Requires Deep Thought and Long-Term Consideration <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>…If nocturnal emission is not cured, it can cause extreme sexual neurasthenia, increasing the risk of marital discord… Young people in Europe and America, where sex education is widespread, know to seek early treatment, so they suffer less harm.</p>
<p>A husband's sexual weakness - such as impotence and premature ejaculation - has become one of the main reasons for divorce cases. In today's age of empowered women, women are no longer willing to endure a bellyful of resentment, shedding tears in secret; in order to fight for the benefits they are entitled to in life, they have no choice but to divorce men who are merely outwardly impressive. Opening the newspaper, such news is not uncommon. Every unmarried young person should be alert to this and examine their own condition early to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<p>Such diseases as impotence and premature ejaculation do not appear suddenly. Nocturnal emission is often their precursor. Originally, strong young people have abundant semen, which overflows when full, and nocturnal emission once every half month or month is harmless, but if it occurs frequently every two or three days, or every day, what does this phenomenon show other than a loosened seminal gate?</p>
<p>Since the seminal gate is loosened, patients will inevitably have difficulty controlling their ejaculation; since semen leakage is excessive, the resources of life are consumed excessively, the spirit is overworked, the nerve center is exhausted, and the erectile force enters a state of paralysis, resulting in impotence. Therefore, whether in theory or in fact, nocturnal emission and impotence premature ejaculation are inextricably linked. Every nocturnal emission patient should know that he is qualified to be a husband who will not satisfy his wife in the future.</p>
<p>Some ignorant people think that nocturnal emission can be cured after marriage. This is a ridiculous fantasy. It should be known that the symptoms of sexual neurasthenia will be more serious with the chance to satisfy sexual desire. Sex education has gradually become widespread in European and American countries, and the general public understands the pros and cons, and knows to seek early treatment before marriage to increase their future happiness. And the progress of medicine has made it unnecessary for them to beg for the examination of doctors. As long as they buy medicine for self-treatment, it will be successful. Dr. Hemitol of Germany is their convenient benefactor. He has devoted his life to researching and successfully producing a special tablet called "Mitto's Sperm Consolidation Tablet," which has the great power to consolidate the seminal gate. Once taken, the ejaculation function will be more tightly bound and will not be rampant.</p>
<p>Dr. Stanna extracted and refined the semen secreted from the endocrine glands of the adolescent gland of fresh and strong animals to make a drug called "Reproductin," which has a mutually beneficial effect with "Mitto's Sperm Consolidation Tablet." The efficacy of sperm consolidation tablets is limited to the consolidation of the seminal gate. As for the weakness caused by mental overwork and excessive consumption of semen, "Reproductin" should be taken to remedy it, so that the secretion of the reproductive glands is vigorous, the resources needed for life are abundant and there is no fear of depletion, then naturally the sperm is strong and the strength is great, and the pathological state of sexual neurasthenia is swept away, and after marriage, it will not be despised by his beloved wife.</p>

<p>(1) Masturbation as an Obstacle to Family Happiness</p>
<p>Patient: Li Jingsheng, 27 years old, Wujin, Jiangsu. Chief complaint – Excessive masturbation in his youth led to the disease of nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. Impotence after marriage, two marriages ended in divorce. Medical history – He knew how to enjoy rubbing his genitals with his fingers at the age of twelve, and then often masturbated during development. He realized his mistake at the age of eighteen, but it was too late. He was physically and mentally exhausted all day long, tired and lazy, and his memory and thinking power had declined to the extreme. He suffered from head heaviness, headaches, insomnia, night sweats, and frequent nocturnal emissions, and often unconsciously leaked semen when exerting himself or being excited. After marrying at the age of twenty-four, although his passion was boiling, he was unable to fully erect, and was greatly hated by his wife. Within half a year, he divorced. His parents did not understand the cause and forced him to marry again. After two months, he went home. Li was depressed and unhappy, and angrily ran away, wandering in Shanghai. He saw the news in the newspaper by chance and came to seek medical treatment. Treatment method – Mr. Li's illness is quite deep and must be treated from the root. First, "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" are used to consolidate his seminal gate and eliminate the scourge of nocturnal emission forever. At the same time, a large amount of reproductive gland extract, "Reproductin," is administered to remedy the reproductive gland that was destroyed early in development. After more than two months, the nocturnal emission stopped, and the sexual function completely returned to normal. Mr. Li was happy to be reborn.</p>
<p>(2) The Evils and Salvation of Youthful Indulgence</p>
<p>Patient: Lin Wentong, 25 years old, Quanzhou, Fujian. Chief complaint – Induced by a maid when he was young, he committed immoral acts repeatedly, which hindered development, resulting in a state of premature aging. Medical history – He lost his mother at a young age, and his stepmother treated him harshly. He often slept with an old maid. When Mr. Lin was ten years old, the maid was already eighteen years old and understood romance well. She seduced the young master to engage in immoral acts. The ignorant child became accustomed to it. At the age of fourteen, he had developed and indulged in lust, which caused lifelong harm. When Mr. Lin was sixteen years old, his maid married, and he began to strictly follow the rules of health preservation, but his physical development was poor, his brain power was weak, and his studies always lagged behind others. He felt like a useless person and did not dare to speak of marriage. Treatment method – Electrotherapy surgery was performed, and a large amount of reproductive gland extract, "Reproductin," was administered to make the reproductive glands re-engage in regular development and maturation, so that internal secretion was vigorous, sexual function was restored, spirit was sufficient, and brain power was developed. After three months of treatment, all the goals were completely achieved. ("Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" and "Reproductin" are both packed in iron boxes; the old stock in paper boxes and bottles has long been recalled and canceled. The paper boxes found on the market now are all counterfeit products imitated by unscrupulous merchants. Do not take them carelessly and suffer harm.)</p>

<p>Mr. Cai Yimin from Jiangjun Lane, Nanjing, wrote: I have been suffering from stomach disease for many years and have almost given up eating and drinking. At first, my abdomen was congested, and later it was in bursts of pain. Seeking medical treatment was ineffective, and I could only listen to fate. Suddenly, a friend from Shanghai visited and said that there were two kinds of medicine: "Stomach Pain Relief," which could relieve pain, and "Stomach Tonic," which could promote appetite and aid digestion. So I bought them and tried them, and they were indeed as good as they were praised.</p>

<p>Ms. Hong Suying from Peng Road in this city wrote: Leukorrhea in women is almost a common disease. Due to shame, they often avoid seeking medical treatment. I am also one of them. Fortunately, I recently learned that there is a topical medicine that is suitable for self-treatment, which cured my hidden disease. Therefore, I am sending a special letter to thank you and hope that my female compatriots will jointly adopt this medicine so that their health can be improved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Lanchun from Wangfujing Street, Beiping, wrote: When I was young, I was determined to have fun. I was especially used to visiting the rouge powder in the north, which led to contracting gonorrhea. I felt extremely painful when urinating. I have also tried many drugs on the market, most of which are not very effective. Recently, with a tentative mentality, I bought and took "Antilin." I heard that it is a combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine, and it has been completely cured, which is really rare.</p>

<p>Mr. Zheng Gefei from Edward Road in this city wrote: When I was developing, I was with bad friends and often discussed the mysteries of the two sexes, which developed the bad habit of masturbation. Although I knew to quit later, I often had nocturnal emissions. Recently, I read your magazine and learned that there are two medicines, "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" and "Reproductin," which are very suitable for my needs. So I bought half a dozen of each. After taking them, the disease I suffered was gone. I realized that what your magazine said was indeed not false and can be a good guide for young people.</p>

<p>My Smoking Cessation Experience</p>
<p>Recalling Past Traumas, Celebrating Future Life</p>
<p>The first day I started smoking opium was as early as twelve years ago during the Jiang-Zhe War between Qi and Lu. The first place I smoked opium was in the famous Bao Yu Lane on Edward Road, which I still remember firmly. After only a week of mingling with them, I was an old gun for a full twelve years. The reason why I became addicted so easily was because I had problems.</p>
<p>In the fourth year after I started smoking opium, I was detained by the French patrol for one night and fined 30 yuan before I was released. After that, I never dared to smoke in a nest of swallows again. I made arrangements with my family. Because I had always been sick, I made several desperate statements, and I finally got my wish. From then on, I smoked at home. I had an uncle who was very concerned about face. Seeing me being so depraved, he became very angry and insisted that I quit, and warned my father. Suddenly, in this situation, I started to quit smoking. It made me gasp for breath, not only was I skinny, but my spirit also fell into a state of coma. I really couldn't support it. Seeing this situation, they were afraid that my life would be in danger, so they had to let me resume smoking. In early autumn of this year, because the family was getting worse and worse, under the guidance of a friend who had quit, I took the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin Purple" as a tonic to quit smoking, because my friend said that my body was too weak, and this was a must. Sure enough, after implementing this reasonable smoking cessation method, the pain of smoking cessation I had experienced before was no longer felt this time. After only two months of taking it, I completely quit. God is really lucky. (Please note that the genuine "Reproductin" is always packed in iron boxes, and those packed in paper boxes are all stomach brand goods)</p>

<p>…High breasts and curved hips can be expected… Modern beauty techniques have reached the pinnacle of perfection.</p>
<p>Taking the essence of the endocrine glands of the adolescent gland (i.e., the reproductive gland) of strong animals to supplement the lack of endocrine in the human reproductive glands can delay the aging of the person. Facial wrinkles can be hidden, and at the same time, the complexion is delicate and keeps the youth for many years. This is indeed the most advanced acquisition of modern beauty techniques, and it is also the most interesting contribution in academics.</p>
<p>Before this method was invented, there were female doctors in Paris who were able to turn the wrinkled faces of old women in their fifties and sixties into plump and smooth faces with their skillful techniques, but after a few months of this surgery, the wrinkled skin became more severe than the original, and the result was a major failure. Therefore, since the invention of the beauty technique of supplementing reproductive gland purple in the human body, unattractive women do not need to use surgery. As long as they take genuine reproductive gland extract, "Female Reproductin," they can make the reproductive glands stronger, promote the function of the digestive organs and metabolism, and gradually make the fatty tissue of the skin vigorous. Not only is the complexion delicate, but also the development is improved, and the breasts are high and plump, and the curves of the hips suddenly appear. Therefore, the progress of modern science has reached the pinnacle of perfection. This is not only a beauty technique.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Is "Moral Degeneration" at Hand? <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>These are the years when retrogressive people shake their heads and sigh about "moral degeneration." Especially when talking about women, the old-fashioned gentlemen spare no effort to affix many complimentary titles upon them, as if China's current plight is entirely the result of the "evil deeds" committed by these "monstrous creatures."</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the way women dress now is indeed vastly different from the way the mothers of retrogressive people dressed in their time. For example, hairstyles: the mothers of retrogressive people probably always had a bun at the back of their heads, but nowadays, even if they don't get perms, young women in Shanghai have mostly adopted the "duck's bottom" style. Another example is feet: the mothers of retrogressive people had a pair of "three-inch golden lotuses," whereas most women now, even if they don't have natural feet, have long since unbound their feet and transformed them into "civilized feet." According to retrogressive people, large feet are for easier escape in times of disaster. Therefore, the increasing domestic and foreign troubles are still due to the liberation of women's feet. As for whether men's large feet are for escaping disaster? That doesn't seem to have been answered.</p>
<p>But in reality, even if women's clothing is different from before, their old moral concepts remain the same. For example, "Miss Wang Meili of Ningbo, aged twenty-eight, ... Seeing the woman's beauty, Xu repeatedly thought of seducing her, but she consistently ignored him. Afterward, he repeatedly sent her letters, but she did not respond. Consequently, around 9 p.m. on the 18th, Xu sent three men to her residence. The three men all claimed to be news reporters and invited her to meet Xu outside the next day. If she refused, they would disclose the details of her love affair with Xu in the newspapers, using all sorts of intimidating words. As a result, the woman became afraid and contemplated suicide..." Logically speaking, if changing one's attire meant "moral degeneration," then that Miss Wang, "aged twenty-eight," would never have "become afraid and contemplated suicide." However, she ultimately "committed suicide." -- Was it really "suicide"? No, she was killed by old moral values. Because she feared that news reporters (?) would "disclose the details of her love affair (let's assume there was a love affair!) in the newspapers," leading to "shameful exposure."</p>
<p>As for whether these three people claiming to be news reporters were genuine news reporters, it's impossible to say for sure because there hasn't been any follow-up. Let's just assume that there are such black sheep among news reporters. If that Miss Wang had been influenced by new ideas, she would have been unafraid to have her love affair published in the newspapers (in fact, we have never seen a respectable newspaper disclose a female worker's love affair in the newspaper). However, precisely because that Miss Wang was too deeply poisoned by old morals, considering love as a "scandalous affair" that could not be exposed, she was taken advantage of by those claiming to be news reporters, and a pure and promising young life came to an end. Using this example, we don't know how many lives have been devoured by old morals under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>However, retrogressive people continue to say, "Moral degeneration is at hand." It seems that the current national apathy and unwillingness to resist anything are all due to "moral degeneration."</p>

<h3 id="e217">Death (Part II) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>Emperor Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han were the most famous seekers of immortality. Having the enjoyment of the world, they were naturally unwilling to give up this pleasure and die. Even the supposedly free-spirited scholars and officials of the Wei and Jin dynasties diligently took elixirs. This shows that even those who were "free-spirited" were not careless about life and death. "Death is the only thing difficult since ancient times"?</p>
<p>Once dead, of course, everything is over, and one will no longer feel lonely. Their loneliness about death is felt when they are alive, seeing others die. *Shi Shuo Xin Yu* records:</p>
<p>"When Wang Jun was appointed as Shangshu Ling, he wore his official robes, rode in a light chariot, and passed by the old site of Huang Gong's wine shop. He turned to the guest in the back carriage and said: 'I used to drink here with Ji Shuye and Ruan Sizong, and even participated in the Bamboo Grove gatherings. Since Ji's early death and Ruan's passing, I have been constrained by the times. Although I see this place so close today, it feels as distant as mountains and rivers'!"</p>
<p>"Prince Ziyou and Prince Zijing were both seriously ill, but Zijing died first. Ziyou asked the attendants around him, 'Why haven't I heard any news? He must have passed away.' He didn't show any grief while saying this. Then, he asked for a sedan chair to go to the funeral. He didn't cry at all. Zijing had always loved playing the zither, so he went straight in, sat on the bier, and took Zijing's green zither. The strings were out of tune, so he threw it on the ground and said: 'Zijing, Zijing, both the man and the zither are gone.' Then, he grieved so much that he fainted for a long time. He also died more than a month later."</p>
<p>"A coffin to cover the body, everything is over," this naturally evokes the feeling of a transient life. "How great is death! The virtuous rest, and the petty cease!" In fact, what virtuous and petty people, what heroes and outstanding figures, death truly ends everything. This threat that has existed since life began has made humanity deeply fearful of death. *Shi Shuo Xin Yu* further records:</p>
<p>"Ren Yuchang once passed under a coffin shop, shedding tears of sorrow. Prime Minister Wang said: 'This is a sentimental fool.'" In fact, Prime Minister Wang's words were incorrect. The main reason why Ren Yuchang shed tears was because he felt that his own future would be the same. Therefore, later generations' unwillingness to write about death, and even their avoidance of the word "death," is the extreme expression of this fear of death.</p>
<p>Chekhov, a Russian writer, has a play called "The Life of Man." It is a symbolic play. He uses a gray person holding a candle to symbolize nature. When he first lights the candle, he says: "A person is born." When the candle is halfway burned, he describes various aspects of his life. Finally, when the candle goes out, he says: "This person has died." This gray play powerfully demonstrates the impermanence of life. At the same time, it concretely expresses the concept of death like a candle being extinguished. When we read this play, our hearts can't help but feel heavy.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to mention a short story called "The Red Laugh." There, the author writes about "death" as "a red laugh, a completely red, toothless laugh." This really scares people.</p>
<p>In Chinese literature, the most relevant work about death is "The Song of Dew on Leeks," but the main idea of this piece is simply that "life is as short as morning dew." Since then, we have seen too many works about this idea. *The Peony Pavilion*: "Such beautiful sights, like water flowing through the years."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>These two lines have intoxicated many souls. But if readers think carefully, what is the sorrow contained in these two lines, besides the fact that time flows like water, getting closer to death day by day? Although it is said that "beauties have always been like famous generals, not allowed to show white hair in the world," how many white-haired old women were once beautiful beauties? We have not seen anyone commit suicide to maintain their beauty and youth.</p>
<p>Since they are unwilling to be lonely, and they cannot avoid death, they create the idea of consciousness after death and "ghosts" to comfort themselves. Among our acquaintances, we often see elderly people who firmly believe in ghosts and gods. In their youth, they did not believe in them much. The reason is that they know the time of their departure is near. How else can they create a concept to comfort themselves?</p>
<p>Besides believing that there is no consciousness after death, there is also "striving to leave a name behind." This is certainly also an expression of being unwilling to be lonely. However, it is even more "helpless."</p>
<p>"I do not see the ancients before me, nor the followers after me. Thinking of the vastness of heaven and earth, I shed tears in sorrow." In Chen Ziang's poem, we smell the loneliness of death.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also people who are more optimistic about "death." *She Bi Lu* says:</p>
<p>"Duke Pei Jin had a magnanimous nature and did not like to take medicine. He often said to people, 'I eat chicken, pork, fish, and garlic whenever I come across them; when the time comes for birth, old age, sickness, and death, I go.'"</p>
<p>At the same time, Liu Ling carried wine and a shovel, saying, "Bury me when I die." This truly uninhibited spirit not only strongly corrected the then-fashionable practice of "taking elixirs" but also ridiculed many false transcendentalists.</p>
<p>As for modern people, Lu Xun's "Death," published before his death, is also a resolute article about death. Finally, let me copy two idioms as the conclusion: "The dead are gone, how can the living bear it?" This is the reason why I wrote this piece! Jiang Wentong and Li Bai's fu poems are not all about "a soul dying and drinking hatred for thousands of years"?</p>
<h3 id="e218">Le Peiyuan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>—— Come to the Land God Temple on the 23rd of this month, I will be waiting for you in the temple.</p>
<p>A classmate who had been sick for a long time, his environment forced him onto the path of weak decline. A large family, with its exquisite enjoyment, in an ancient city deeply ambushed by opposing forces, does not allow the so-called "young master" to act wantonly. Surrounding him, besides the sounds of mahjong and the aroma of wine, trying to sneak out to a park or a quieter place to get some fresh air is simply out of the question. "Family rules" do not give him such leisure.</p>
<p>As a result, the lung disease is gradually spreading. Food and courses are all out of the question for him. After that, he should still thank the disease for its gift, using the excuse of "seeing a doctor" to come out and thoroughly enjoy the environment outside the "family."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this time he asked me to go to the Land God Temple, using the same method. The purpose is not difficult to imagine. At the end of the letter, he was still afraid of getting the location wrong, specifically pointing out that it was the one near Zhangyi Gate.</p>
<p>I had no way to refuse this request. Counting the days, there were still two days left!</p>
<p>Temple fairs are not uncommon in the ancient city. They are held in rotation every month. The established customs of the Land God Temple on the third day (note) and the Longfu Temple on the tenth are lightly imprinted on the minds of those who are old at running around. It is a bit like a prototype of a "market," but it is much more complete in scale. All kinds of goods extend from the entire temple to half a street. People squeeze, letting the sounds become one. Selection, competition, shouting, scolding... It is so common that it no longer attracts people's attention.</p>
<p>With a happy mood, I arrived at the temple at the appointed time. However, without a relatively fixed location and with so many people, how can I find this small old man afflicted with lung disease? I walked around the connected cloth tents. After walking around, I thought that perhaps he was in the big open space behind the temple, attracted by the lovely flowers and plants. Did that place make him feel an unparalleled interest?</p>
<p>There were also quite a few people here, but where was there any sign of him? Changing to a mood of disappointment, I walked through a path behind me. At the street corner, a sign with "Le Peiyuan" was hung. This alley was strangely unfamiliar. Judging from the terrain, passing through it would definitely lead to the main street.</p>
<p>It was simply another environment. Although it was only separated from the temple by a wall, it was like two different worlds.</p>
<p>The clothes depicted their living conditions. The early autumn wind was blowing. Short clothes, no socks, open chests, it can be said that there was everything. In the two teahouses at the street corner, some people were even sitting with their feet up high, digging out dirt from their feet. The entire winding alley was full of noisy scenes (to be continued).</p>

<p>White Sugar</p>
<p>In China, which is oppressed and exploited by the ×× Empire, there is no safe place - the three northeastern provinces have already been lost: North China is almost gone. In Shanghai, large batches of soldiers have also come, and smuggling has also invaded the poor rural areas, cutting off the lives of small merchants -</p>
<p>Boss Li is a kind and honest man, but honest people cannot survive in the world, so he was robbed of his business by Boss Wang, who sold smuggled sugar, robbing him of his native goods store business. So he asked his wife and daughter Li Huaying, who had just returned from Shanghai for summer vacation, to cook some lotus seed soup, wanting to invite Boss Wang and the bosses of various stores in the countryside for a meal, taking this opportunity to discuss the smuggling issue in order to control the sale of smuggled goods.</p>
<p>So, the mother and daughter busily peeled lotus seeds. The mother hated the hot weather, and the daughter talked about the harm of smuggling, so much so that she ruined the lotus seeds, incurring the mother's grumbling. At this time, Boss Li ran in. He had high hopes for today's meeting: he also talked about many students in Shanghai going to the countryside to seize smuggled goods. - For the mother's feudal mind, she still thought that "what can children do, it's just temporary excitement."</p>
<p>Just as they were talking, Zhang Yipeng, Li Huaying's male classmate, came to report that the students were about to gather at the train station to seize smuggled goods and wanted Li Huaying to go. The daughter bravely agreed, regardless of her mother's opposition.</p>
<p>The guests who came that day included:</p>
<p>Gao Rongtang - Gao Boss's representative, a typical young and mature person.</p>
<p>Boss Wang - A cunning smuggler.</p>
<p>Boss Liu - A timid and chronic merchant, a typical Chinese country old man.</p>
<p>So everyone had a meeting. The young people showed their youthful vigor? The dawn of the new society Rong</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>He also realized his own crisis, striving to make the meeting a success.</p>
<p>Next to the meeting room, in the store, the clerk and apprentice, following Boss Li's words, threw copper coins hard into the cash register to cover up the business's sluggishness.</p>
<p>But the meeting was fruitless. Boss Wang heard the news that students were seizing smuggled goods at the train station, so he hurriedly slipped away quietly. Li Huaying also quietly slipped to the train station to help seize smuggled goods. And the end of the meeting was in the midst of the noisy shouts of "return the goods" and "return the money" outside the store.</p>
<p>As a result, the crowd caught Boss Wang's accomplice - a train station clerk, exposing Boss Wang's smuggling incident. Therefore, traitors - cannot exist in the crowd's anti-Japanese salvation efforts!</p>

<p>China-West (1040) 1-1:45 pm</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Ode to the Red Cliff"</p>
<p>Elegant scholar writes about Huangzhou. Every day he roams freely along the river. On the day of Renxu in the autumn of Jiwang. Talking with two or three close friends. Xiao Tong ascends the Red Cliff boat. Soon the moon rises on the eastern mountain. Leaning on the railing, looking at Dou Niu. Plucking the strings to make a clapper to sing the bright moon. Often bringing Taibai full. A song of Qingge and a drink of wine. Guests harmonize and the sound is melodious. Like a bereaved woman weeping in a lone boat. It's like Cao Mengde back then. Composing poems and playing with Xingyouyou. Descending Jiangling. Breaking Jingzhou. The axis is thousands of miles downwind. It is indeed a disaster for a lifetime. I don't know where he is now. Thirty-six thousand are easily passed. How lucky is it to be a mayfly in life. But one must see through the vain fame and fortune. Talking about poverty, I am also ashamed. Wash the cup and drink. Leftovers are collected. The cups and plates are in disarray. Sleeping on the boat together.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Prelude to "Crossroads" <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>This is a play that depicts the situation of graduating and then being unemployed. It is an epitome of the lives of the vast number of Chinese youth. A way out, a way out, where can the youth find a way out in this society? Solving the depression of young people is the theme of this play.</p>
<p>The playwright is Shen Xibao, who has directed "Nostalgia," "Fourteen Hours in Shanghai," and "Boatman's Daughter."</p>
<p>"Crossroads" sketches four intellectual youths living in Shanghai. They are all very kind, but they cannot find a bite to eat in this huge society, even though they have graduated from university. The author has great sympathy for them, but this is not a simple sympathy, but a powerful indication.</p>
<p>The four young people here are: the decadent one, who ends up committing suicide; the active one, who lost his home when he returned from the northeast, and ended up returning to his hometown; and there are two who are both capable and optimistic. They had found jobs, but still lost them. The author here indicates that unemployment is not due to people's lack of effort, but to the entire social problem.</p>
<p>The four roles are played by Zhao Dan, Lü Ban, Yi Ming, and Liu Shangwen, and the female roles are played by Yin and Bai Yang.</p>
