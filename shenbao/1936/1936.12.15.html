<h3>英法調解西班牙內戰　德意葡復文欠明晰　希望各國能補充說明　西班牙叛軍反對調解</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於英法兩國政府所提調解西班牙內亂一項建議、德意志與葡萄牙兩國所提覆文、業於昨日送達英國外務部、外務部閱悉之後、當因內容尙欠明晰、仍望各該國政府、能以補充說明、茲悉德國政府擬淤本日發表宣言、切實說明該國意向、甚望葡國政府亦能切實表明態度云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英法所提調解西班牙內戰之建議、德政府已覆文送交英法駐柏大使、內稱、德國準備贊助恢復西班牙和平狀態與防杜戰禍延及歐洲他處之一切計畫、如其他政府能提出調解具體辦法、德國準備合作，加以研究、惟其他政府對於德國所願阻止志願兵源源開入西班牙一節、未予實同、德政府殊以爲憾、德政府之意、停止直接與間接干涉、須併爲一事以處理之、至於德政府之承認西班牙國民軍政府、蓋鑒於另一作戰方面舉動野蠻、而以爲西班牙無共他分子能以輔助其國民自居、　以與西班牙政府方面殊難任何諒解故也、（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（一）各項措置、凡目的在於阻止西班牙內戰之繼續擴大者、德國均準備加以贊助、</p>
<p>（二）德國政府、曾於八月二十七日、勸告各國、應將禁止志願兵赴西班牙投效一項、列入不干涉辦法之內、所惜其他各國政府、對於此層、並未有所决定、遂使西班牙局勢　益臻嚴重、德國政府、現以爲禁止任何直接或間接干涉西班牙內戰之辦法、應作整個討論而後可，</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>非常時期的金融和物價</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>昨日本市商品市塲的紊亂。與市價漲落的懸殊。是非常時局在經濟界的明顯的反映。公債受時局的影響最敏捷。起先本有不開市之議。一經開市。統一各債無一不跌去四元。而至停板。這是統一債上市以來未有的現象。紗花更奇特了。本月期紗開盤跌去五元餘。二盤卽回漲十二元。花亦漲一元數角。此種漲跌。除了商人的心理作用。實在沒有多大的理由。最可驚異的。粉麥雜糧油餅漲得好似沒有止境。例如粉價自一月期以下都高至四元三角以上。期麥開至七元一角二。已到數十年來所未有的價格了。豆油每担已在二十四元四角。生油亦至二十二元。如回想到去年行情。單就油類來說。我們生活費的支出。已加起一倍有餘了。</p>
<p>標金一年來本無甚出入。昨日由于投機的機會。一日之中居然有十四元的起伏。結果是漲起五元四角。此外如五金桐油反爲了時局不安而停頓。其實在漲暴跌固不該。交易停頓亦不必要知時局不安。吾人更不應自相驚擾。徒增其不安之因素。因爲我們如果要使當前危險的時局獲得有利的解决。不能不同時努力於經濟的安定的。</p>
<p>安定經濟之道。首在安定金融。在這非常期問。國民對於法幣。不應再懷絲毫的疑慮。如昨日之大家爭購外匯。實是很可痛心的情形。我們應知惟有策金融的安定。才能自拔於困境。否則各自爲謀。適足造成害人害己的結局而已。我們以爲在這時期。負金融全責者對於金融。固應作周密的籌畫。社會大衆。尤其是金融工商業及一般富翁。爲自己着想。爲國家着想。也都　絕對的信任政府的貨幣政策不可。</p>
<p>至於物價飛漲。至如昨日之甚。顯然是失常狀態。如果再不圖謀善後。前途實很可慮。我們以爲負有指導工商業之責者。對於不合理的物價上漲。應當立卽出而糾正。有時竟亦不妨加以制止。因爲消極的的制正是維持市面最簡捷的方法。現在總結賬期漸近。倘若經濟界一有變故。工商業勢必要再受重大的打擊。我們必須防患於未然纔是。</p>
<h3>日蘇間　漁業協定無簽訂望　各方抨擊有田外交政策　廣田內閣明春恐將辭職</h3>
<p>（東京）自日本駐蘇大使重光葵、與蘇外委李維諾夫第一次會見後、日蘇漁業協定、無在本年年底前簽訂之希望、已極端明顯、李維諾夫表示、蘇政府不信日德協定之目的僅在反共、蓋日德之地理位置、明白表示兩國目標之何在、故蘇政府在未决定其新態度前、不欲置答云云、蘇聯之强硬態度、可於李氏之表示窺見之、有田昨復訓令重光、加倍努力、促請蘇聯簽字、但一般人恐此種努力、終歸無效、日本各報抨擊廣田有田之外交政策、視前益烈、盛傳各黨準備對內閣加以糾彈、同時樞密院亦正事迫究政府外交失敗之責任、現恐有田之辭職、難以避免、其期殆在來年春初、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於日蘇漁業條約調印事、蘇俄於九日重光大使與李托維諾夫會談時、答稱、目下蘇俄政府現在審議日蘇漁業條約調印之措置、待决定方針後、再通吿日本政府云、故外務省方面以樂觀的觀察、等待蘇俄方面之復文、然蘇俄方面、因條的上之義務、不僅有調印漁業條約之義務、且自該條約毀棄後、其所蒙影響、顯較日本允重大、因此由下列各點觀之、如蘇俄方面之拒絕調印等、似非可得而預想、</p>
<p>日本之漁業權、爲實歷二年以來較古之旣得權益、甚且依據樺太千島交換條約日俄基本條約等而爲所確認者、况依日俄構和條約第十一條、蘇俄方面負有與日本作成協定之義務、故蘇俄方面旣承認國際條約之存在、則蘇俄實不得拒絕調印該漁業條約、</p>
<p>蘇俄方面依漁業條約之規定、製作北洋漁業起用日本臣民之體裁、以保持國家之體面、設一旦而爲無條約狀態、則日本國民之强行在北洋出漁、亦屬顯然之事、故蘇俄國家之體面、由是致有瑕疵、</p>
<p>漁業條約爲拘束日本北洋漁業之自由企圍、由一定之限制使行使漁業樣、故日本若得脫此拘束自由出漁、則蘇俄之不利甚巨、而於日本之漁業權於實質的殆無影響，蘇俄方而由國論擾亂策迄明年初春、出諸遷延調印之陋劣態度、此乃不難預想者、由斯以上之客觀情勢而論斷、則結局確信不久或將調印、（十四日同盟電（</p>

<p>張學良爲什麼會叛變、因爲張學良、是負有西北勦匪的責任、然而這幾年他在西北一帶勦匪的成績、却不很好、不但剿匪成績不佳、同時因勦匪之故、他的力量又受了相當的損失、因爲他的部隊、不能勦匪、他就感覺勦匪困難、爲勦匪困難、他就不願意勦匪、但是他不說不願意勦匪、却托詞主張容共、以掩飾他不能勦匪的過失、我們在國民革命運動過程當中、碰見了一個空前的外患國難、幾幾乎使我們全國人民手足失措、同時、中國有共產黨的擾亂、如果我們在國民革命的過程中、祇遭遇外息、而沒有共產黨的擾亂、沒有共產黨在國內牽制、我們相信當前國難的解除、一定可以有相當把握、至少我們可使國難不會加重到今日這樣、中國當前國難之所以如此嚴重、使我們到今日還沒有解除國難的十分把握、最大的牽制力量、就是中國的赤匪、中國赤匪、過去　江西湖南安徽福建浙江等省邊界、擾亂了六七年之久、非但　幾省人民所受了不可計算的損失、同時又牽制了我們國軍達數十萬之多、自前年赤匪在江西湖南安徽福建浙江等省邊境、遭我國軍大舉圍勦、受創崩潰、西竄到四川陝西甘肅一帶、在那一帶擾亂、又有二三年之久、又牽制了不少國軍、所以共產黨在中國擾亂將近有十年之久、這十年來、不但使中國各地受到無可計算的損失、並且牽制我們國家的建設、牽制我們不能以全力來應付外患、解除國難、其次、我們所以不能容共、第一、是因爲我們現在最迫切的需要、是民族的自决、與獨立運動、而共匪　主張階級鬥爭、分化民族的力量、第二、共匪仰承第三國際的鼻息、實爲一種赤色的漢奸、外息的僞匪、固足以　中國、內亂的共匪、亦為中國民族的大患、所以共黨主義、决不能救中國、眞正適合中國能救中國的主義、是一民主義、我們如果要中國不亡、要中國獨立、要中國復興、我們不但不能容納赤匪、並且要根本上來殲赤匪、我們要建設新的中國、要復興中華民族、非要殲滅赤匪不可、我們要禦侮救國、我們更非要殲滅赤匪不可、所以蔣委員長要安內後再攘外、要先拿國內安定後、纔能以全國的力量集中起來、一致對外、如果國家不統一、國內有赤匪擾亂、我們就不能對外、這是很淺而易見的道理、</p>
<p>張學良此次借　容共、就是違反了我們國家的國策、我們的國策是什麽、我們的國策就是勦匪、除奸、禦侮、救國、勦赤匪、除漢奸、禦外侮、救國家、是我們的國策、張學良要聯共、卽違反國策、違反國策、就是與我們全國四萬萬五千萬人民作對、違反全國人民的公意、來顚覆我們的國家、他圍困蔣委員長、卽是予我們全國人民在積極作救广圖存復興民族運動的時候以一大打擊、這一個打擊、不僅足使我們救广圖存的工作、因而停頓、並且足使我們國家民族的前途、發生極大的危險、在今日這樣情形之下、我們全國人民、應知道此事事態之重大、更要一致豐結起來、來擁護蔣委員長、並以全國一致的很嚴正的態度、來要求張學良、從速恢復蔣委員長的自由、勿使我們國家失了重心、同時、全國人民還應一致擁護國民政府、及其勦匪除奸禦侮救國的國策、並擁護中央處分張學良的辦法、在地方我們應嚴防共黨、及其他一切漢奸擾亂地方造謠煽惑、而我全國人民、尤應了解國難之嚴重、一致在中央領導之下、進行勦匪除奸禦侮救國的工作、勿可輕信謠言、自亂步驟、致爲敵人所乘、尤其是我們上海、上海是我們全國經濟的重心、上海這個地方、關係於全國者很大、我們上海市市民受此意外打擊、在萬分痛心之餘、尤應十分鎮靜沈着來應付此時局、聽候政府處置、上海的治安、我們政府負有完全的責任、絕對不使地方治安有何影響、希望上海市市民、鎭靜沈着、與上海市政府共同來維持這個困難的局面、如果全國人民、尤其是上海市市民、能够鎭靜沈着、聽候政府處置此西安事變、並一致團結擁護國民政府與蔣委員長、我相信此次事變、不難卽可解决、因爲西安方面張學良的部下、還不乏深明大義之人卽張學良本人所以出此謬舉、恐亦爲環境所迫、非完全出諸自動、我想他也决不敢完全不顧全國人民的公意、而一意孤行的、所以祇要全國人民鎭靜沈着擁護政府、我敢斷言此事一定很快就可解决的、</p>
<h3>宋子文接見記者　發表重要談話　是否赴西安一行待命於政府　宋受孔囑留滬金融市塲平穩</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會常委兼中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、此次南下赴粵桂視察、業於前日北返抵滬、昨日正午、在中國銀行接見新聞記者、發表重要之談話如下、</p>
<p>西安事變須速解决</p>
<p>據宋氏談、關於西安事變、本人所得之消息、均如報載、蔣院長在西安絕對安全、本人以爲西安事變、乃係國家最不幸之事、目前急須用有效之方法、於最短期內解决、蓋以全世界之目光刻正集中於中國也、本人與蔣院長公私之關係、及與張學良多年之友誼、均爲人所共知、在此特殊關係之中、如有任何可能解决之辦法、本人極願在政府指導之下、盡最大之努力、至於採取何種方法、須待政府决定、本人是否有赴西安一行之必要、亦待命於政府也、端納已抵洛陽、卽將轉往西安、本人受孔財長之囑託留滬、對於金融方面、加以照料、目前市塲尙稱平穩、中·中·交·三行、對於外匯照常無限制買賣、</p>
<p>粵省發展必甚迅速</p>
<p>宋氏繼述赴粵經過云，本人自隨北伐軍離粵後、在七年前曾返粵一行、此次爲第二回，所得感想甚爲深刻、尙憶北伐時、在粵商議黨國大政、擬定兩種方案、其一爲整理粵省經濟以鞏固黨國基礎、其二爲出師北伐、以完成革命、當時經决定採取後者、故卽興師北伐、而粵省經濟卽陷於停頓、數年來且與其他各省阻絕、其最顯著者、如（一）幣制之不同、其與各省之匯兌須以港幣轉輾換算、（二）交通之阻隔、以前全由海道、現在統一完成、粵漢鐵路亦且通車、故在經濟上已與全國打成一片、以後之發展當甚迅速而宏大、</p>
<p>滬金融界紛往投資</p>
<p>論粵省之經濟政策、以前因在阻離之狀態下、故均以一省爲單位、如粵省並不產棉、而亦自營紗廠、其他工業亦以自產自給爲原則、粵民食米、自產不足、則仰給於暹羅、漏巵甚鉅、現自交通改善、統一完成後、其經濟計劃、自以國內一份子作打算、此係自然之趨勢、粵省地方富庶、將來之發展、當無限量、金融界前以幣制不統一、故均裏足不前、現則紛紛前往投資、如交通金城大陸等，均在計劃設置分支行、近因食米受商人操縱、糧價騰貴、省當局爲調節民食、向金融界接洽辦運湘米、卽此一端、可知以後粵省之復興、與全國經濟金融關係之一般、</p>
<p>開發計劃重各點</p>
<p>朱氏又談，此行曾往海南島視察、其原因有二、蓋渠原籍係海南文昌縣、便道返籍省視、而該島在中國經濟上之特殊地位、有亟謀開發之必要、宋氏謂在交昌時、曾向該地記者詳談、想已見報載、惟概言之、我國雖地大物博、但僅海南島則有熱帶物產、植物如樹膠榔子咖啡、鑛產亦豐富、而尤以錫爲大宗、我國每年入超甚鉅、而熱帶物產之輸入甚多、開發該島、可挽回不少漏巵、其於國內經濟之重要可想見、至於開發計劃之最要者、爲一、開闢海港、在海口附近築港埠、二、建築鐵路、由海港東經文昌而至島之南部、以便物產之輸運、約需費二千五百萬至三千萬元、在粵省大陸、則擬與建粵梅鐵路、以東達福建、北貫江西、在經濟及國防上、均甚重要、建費約四千四五百萬元、至黃埔闢港擬造成二等港、第一步濬深珠江、使八九千噸商輪可進出該港、其費用約六百萬元、以後進行者、則爲建造碼頭棧房及鐵路等、以上各項計劃、省當局在積極進行中、將來全國經濟委員會、將予以技術上之恊助、</p>
<p>桂省出路厥在礦產</p>
<p>李宗仁白崇禧兩氏均屬老友、此次應邀赴桂暢聚、便道並視察桂省之經濟情形、並未談及任何政治及財政問題、桂省異常貧窮、然全省頗有組織、因此可應付經濟上之困難、廣西原爲入超之省、邇來努力生產、及抵制奢侈品之輸入、得以减少入超之數量、桂省礦產甚多、以後經濟上之出路當在此也、桂省幣制改革之後、金融界當紛往籌設分行、正如粵省目前之情形也、</p>
<h3>西安事變後　滬陜匯兌照常　歐亞機停降西安隴海路停運　至昨晚潼關以上電報仍未通</h3>
<p>西安事變發生後、滬陝間匯兌、各銀行照常收受、滬新等航錢、中止在西安等處降落、滬陝電訊、截至昨晚止、潼關以上、仍未接通、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>滬陜匯兌照常收受</p>
<p>西安爲陝西之省會、中央中國交通中國農民上海等銀行、均設立分支行、辦理國內匯兌、自西安事變發生後、關於上海至陝省各地匯兌、新聲社記者昨晚向中國銀行探悉、以上各銀行、均照常收受、惟各業以西安等處甚爲混亂、故匯欵暫時觀望、數額因之驟减、</p>
<p>陸空交通均受影響</p>
<p>歐亞航空公司滬新錢機、雖照常飛行、經過西安時、則中止停降、至於蘭州至包頭綫、寗夏至蘭州段已停航、包頭至寗夏段、公司未得報吿、隴海鐵路暫通至華陰後、該路聯運貨車、因輸送繁忙、不得已暫行停運、招商局行駛連雲港各輪、已减少船隻、</p>
<p>潼關以上電報受阻</p>
<p>昨據交通部上海電報局消息、陝西省潼關以上、如西安·蘭州·華陰·赤水·渭南·零口·新豐·臨潼·咸陽·白水·　鷄·蒲城·三原·等處電報、截至昨晚仍受阻未通、惟潼關以下隴海沿綫各地電報、則照常通達、</p>

<h3>市黨部昨擴大紀念週　國人應認識努力　陶百川報吿摘録　歷數張學良之非</h3>
<p>國民社云、本市市黨部、昨日上午召集各區分部代表五百餘人、舉行擴大紀念週、由常務委員陶百川、對時局作重要報吿、茲摘錄其辭於下、（一）本月十二日、張學良突在西安率部叛變、同時刦持蔣委員長、並發出通電、主張推翻國民政府、聯合共產黨中央對此、已有適當處置辦法、各省亦皆效忠中央、蔣委員長現尙安全、此爲不幸中之大幸、（二）査張學良叛變少原因、雖然說是爲了政治主張、其實張學良是一個扶不起的劉阿斗、他個人懂得什麽政治、他的叛變、第一是因為中央要他剿赤匪、而他爲保全貫力、不但不願剿赤匪、反去勾結赤匪、同時爲文飾自己的過失、就高唱不剿赤匪的口號、所以這次事變、完全是舊式軍閥保持地盤反抗中央的老把戲、（三）張學良通電說要打回東北老家去、這顯然是欺人之談、一個不守東北老家、而把老家拱手送人的人、誰相信他能打回東北老家去、而且要打回老家、必須擁護領袖、鞏固中央、團結內部、充實國力、而後方有辦法、像他那種行動、乃是要打倒領袖、推翻中央、解散內部的團結、消滅國家的力量、充其極則中國恐將變爲西班牙第二、如何能够打回老家、東北是張學良一手斷送的、他從前斷送了東北、現在又在斷送西北、他眞是民族的罪人、我們人民能容忍這個罪人的行動麽、（四）張學良通電說要聯合共產黨、這是一個極危險的主張，共產黨的背景在第三國際、共產黨的立塲是階級鬭爭、而中國現在是要做民族自决和民族獨立的運動、我們不能讓階級鬭爭來消滅民族鬭爭的力量、我們不能讓第三國際來决定我們的民族命運、因此我們不能聯合共產黨、我們不能聯合白色帝國主義的漢奸、我們同樣也不能聯合第二國際的工具、（五）張學良通電說要聯俄、我們應先考慮俄國有無對日戰爭的必要和决心、俄國是否願與中國聯合、俄國有無帮助中國的力量、我們有理由可以相信、（甲）因爲日本竭力想交歡俄國、因爲俄國對日本並無必戰的原因、因爲俄國在歐洲很受意德的牽制、所以蘇俄現在沒有對日戰爭的决心、我們承認、對蘇聯表示友誼和好感、則是現政府早在竭力進行、無待張學良來提議、更何可扣留領袖稱兵作亂、（六）總之張學良這决叛變、對蔣委員長個人是忘恩負義、對中央政府是犯上作亂對赤匪共黨是勾結、他們繼續危害中國、對察綏匪僞是助長他們的氣燄、以自壞其萬里長城、對蘇聯是犯了單相思病、而對他自己則自掘墳墓、中國因此所受的損失、眞是不堪想像、張學良眞是國家民族的罪人、（七）我們現在的任務、（甲）重新申明擁護蔣委員長、並要求張學良立卽無條件恢復蔣委員長的一切自由、（乙）重新申明擁護國民政府及其剿匪除奸禦侮救國的國策、（丙）擁護中央處分張學良的辦法、（戊）嚴防赤匪共黨、以及其他一切漢奸擾亂地方（已）不准赤匪共黨、以及其他一切漢奸混在民衆中間、造謠煽惑、庚民衆應了解國難之嚴重、務須在中央領導之下、進行剿匪除奸禦侮救國的工作、不可輕信浮言、自亂步驟、致為敵人所乘、八黨與國家處此嚴重開頭、凡屬本黨同志、皆應獻身黨國、第一領導人民做判上列六點、第二要個人皆負起警察和偵探的責任、防止一切敵人搖動人心破壞治安、古語說得好、士窮見節義、世亂識英雄、現在正是我們試騐的時候、願同志們大家努力、</p>

<h3>救護綏遠前綫將士之急切需要（下）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周博士講江晦鳴記</p>
<p>三　防毒需要</p>
<p>現代戰爭的勝敗，决於軍備的良窳，似乎已無可非議。但有的時候，並不是如此簡單，還要關係到「天時」「地利」「人和」上面去。大家都知道，現在戰爭中最犀利的武器，要算空軍，空軍的權威，能在幾分鐘以內，燬滅敵人的城市，毒斃成數的軍民，只要注意國防的國家，莫不在那裏積極的準備，希望每年增加空軍的數字，可想而知空軍在戰爭中的權威了。甚而有許多軍事家說一未來世界的不安，都要繫命於空軍的賜予！我們耳鼓裏常聽見這種議論，我們無時無刻不在那裏當心着敵人的空襲。綏遠的將士們，常然也是十分顧慮的。</p>
<p>自從奪回百靈廟前的幾塲血戰，我們又似乎經騐到··敵人的飛機完全失却了控制力！不用說，這都是天時地利有益於我們。我們知道，當敵人空襲的時候，施放毒氣，是要借助屬力的，這裏所謂風力，要有一定的風向和不甚激烈的風力，才能趁其目的；可是綏遠那地方，原是一片荒漠，氣候的冷澈刺骨，每在攝氏零度以下十五度左右，有的時候，早晚氣候的變化，很有極大的變遷，所以風向不僅沒有一定的，而且風力的狂飇浪捲，更是無法把握；那些空襲下的毒氣，不僅在半空中吹散到不知去向，有的時候，反有吹向自己陣營的危險，他人的陣營地面上所能受到的，眞是幾希極微！因此敵人毒氣的威力，也就好似英雄無用武之地的一樣。同時，在我們國十的綏遠，那地方很少崇山峻嶺，惟有大地平原，遍地黃草，漫無人烟，入夜遠望，宛如天地一色，敵人的飛機，又失却了他們的爆炸力。就是敵人的飛機，不惜亂擲炸彈，但被炸的機會，確是很少，正同買航空獎券，多少决未必命中一决，因爲那地方很少有飛機投彈的目標，幸運間我們又佔有地利。</p>
<p>更興奮地，前綫戮戰的將士，個個爲了要爭民族的光榮而戰，死已早置度外，不啻極得人和。不過，我們觀察所得，還有一個小的顧慮，雖然敵人的飛機失却了他們的戰鬥力，可是，我們的將士總不免有些提防，這與戰鬥上的，力量不可謂沒有减少，所以，我認爲防而不備，還是必要，後方援助他們的人，仍有積極捐助防毒而具，及禦寒用品，如手套，棉被，背心等，輸送前方，以增加他們殺敵致果的必要。</p>
<p>四　今後救護的方針</p>
<p>綏遠的戰爭，就是中華民族生存的戰爭，那末，救護事業就應該由全中華民族中有救護知識的人才，共同策動的必要。所以上海方面擔任救護事業的公團，紅十字會等，就負有聯絡各地護人才，救護組織，集中分配的措置。北平，也可算是中國的國防前綫，那些地方救謎人才很是可觀，而又便於供應前綫的需要，所以本人尙須至北平一行，商得密切的聯絡。我們認爲今後救護工作，旣非一隅一地之事，就應該由全國共同負起，以應前方如何需要，而决其對策，阿以宣吿於國人者，至於詳細的辦法，限於時間，等待有了機會，再作公開的報吿。</p>
<p>末了，我記得閻百川先生，傅宜生先生，他們在克復百靈廟以後，先後對我們的表示，他們認爲未來的勝利，要繫於「哀軍必勝」的四字上，我們切不可以爲百靈廟收復，就從此驕怠，我們還要想到收復百靈廟以後的前途，還有荊棘，要不輕敵，要不誇功，才可以收復其他的失地，這些鼓勵，完全要靠着後方的人士，不斷的鼓勵激揚，還要不斷地給予物質的援助才行。更進一步說，不要以爲打勝仗就援助，打敗仗就縮手，勝敗乃兵家常事，前綫的健兒，很需要後方人士的精神和物質，給予他們的偉大鼓勵的。</p>
<p>記者附言：本篇因龐先生忽促就道，北上赴平，未及請其指正，容有記錄錯誤，由記者負責。</p>
<h3>戰時救護統制問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>國運無日不在非常時期中，綏遠之戰已呈緊張之局面，寒冬已屆，而我戰士近正於邊陲浴血應戰，據聞綏束匪軍又已開始運用化學戰具於其前方，在此化學毒氣發揮殺人效用時，對於前綫戰士之救護實爲不可緩之事也目前綏遠戰幕已揭，我軍已佔據百靈廟，其激烈殘酷，其傷亡情形，其痛苦危亡悲殘之狀定有不堪言者，况在此塞外醫藥落後，大批醫藥之運輸及衛生用具之徵集與救護人員之發動均爲當務之急，近年來國一人對於應付非常時期中各項問題均有所一研究，而對於救傷療疾之救護問題則未一見提出討論，此實爲遺恨之事也，報載中國男護士改進社擬統一救護陣容（見十一月二十日京中各報）革命先進何香凝女士近又徵集黨國名流書畫展覽將所得之資爲籌組前綫救護隊之用此實爲難能可貴之舉，上海各界聞人正組織一較永久性之救護事業委員會，各界名流又熱烈匡助，此均爲良好之現象也，政府於此時正擬作統制之舉以免步驟零亂，筆者不揣冒昧，特將平日研究心得草成斯篇以供國人參考，仍望賢者不吝給以糾正。</p>
<p>國家之創立衛生機關，其主要點卽平日爲民衆作保健工作預防疾病所謂謀人類社會之幸福是也，若遇一旦國家戰事爆發其責任卽爲救護醫療作戰同志之傷病，我愛國戰士爲國勤勞效命沙塲，蹈鋒鏑冒風霜在槍林彈雨中忍飢枵腹，傷病勢所難免，若無一適當之救護機關爲之救護治療則國家將因傷病而减少作戰之能力，對於戰事亦頗不利，若果救護得力則雖有傷病亦可轉危爲安迅速就途復執干戈效命疆塲以達保邦衛國之旨趣，故此戰時救護機關之重要非特直接對戰士有關，而間接對於國家前途影響亦頗巨也。近年來世界各列强雖對軍備力加擴充然同時亦兼籌衛生設施最明顯者如日本國將全國衛生行政劃分爲二種一卽爲「一般衛生」，專爲民衆作保健工作直屬於內務省，一卽爲「特殊衛生」專爲籌劃軍營衛生所謂國防衛生，直轄於陸軍及海軍省管理是也。作者於八月由日考察返國時對於該國衛生之觀感曾草成一文介紹之，諒國人於中央日報前　學週刋內見之矣。再如意亞之戰當初　生時意軍士兵因不服亞國氣候與水土因病而亡者頗不乏人後意國當局有囊及此乃調國內醫學專家開赴前方加以研究另又令該國之男護士隨同萬國紅十字會救護隊共同工作，意亞之戰，意國雖以軍械良好勝，然亦不得不歸功於該國之衛生與救護之得法也。目前各國處於此非常時期中，外寇侵凌黎國同仇，邊陲戰幕已展，收復失地至爲急迫，允應未雨綢繆預爲計劃，以備戰事擴大時之須，否則臨渴掘井則應付定艱，茲先述政府對於救護統制之要則於後。</p>
<p>政府對於戰時救護應加以統制自不待言，其統制之原則有二，一爲人力之集中一爲財力之集中，設平日無相當統制，一旦須人應用，則將戚供求不應，手足無所措之弊而工作亦將致紊亂無系指揮不便之地步，先述集中人力。</p>
<p>甲集中人力··非常時期中人力實爲重要，政府於此時應量才而用，將組織之醫藥衛生團體加以嚴格與系統之統制以便指揮而利工作，故應於首都所在地組織一永久性之全國救護事業委員會以便統籌兼顧該委員會內並應網羅社會名流與熱心社會服務者若干人共同組織之，吾國過去醫學教育與衛生事業之不發達，其根原卽平日政府與入民對於衛生設施均不加聞問，因之暗中則受醫閥趁機操縱與壓制，所謂門戶之見，排除異己，比比皆是，故有中西醫之對立，進而更有所謂英美派與德日派之分岐，近更進有醫師與護士之論戰鈎心鬥角，此種畸形事件實爲吾衛生與醫教之恥耳。今後切望民衆力促政府加以調整，而更望最高衛生行政當局，應開誠布公容納各種人才以求事業上之精進，切不可再蹈覆轍，以門戶爲主以派別爲見，給予民衆惡劣之影響也此亦爲統制救護工作中之人事問題，關於人才集中亦可分爲二項言之卽組織與訓練是也。組織爲推動事業之原動力，無組織卽無系統，亦可言之爲無團結，若內部組織不健全對於事業之進展亦當受有若干阻礙，試觀吾國過去參加前錢救護之效果若何？成續何在？一言以論之實無成效可言，筆者亦曾數决參加前綫救護工作身歷其境，故對此亦有相當經騐也。考失敗之原因卽政府對救護無統制是也。無通盤計劃是也，如各民衆團體熱心公益紛紛組織救護隊參加前綫，平日旣乏訓練至前錢又無組織，此所謂烏合之衆是也，憑一時之情威是否能持支長久？故前綫雖見有紅十字之旗幟，但工作日漸于陷入閒散懈怠狀態之下，往往因人事問題致意見紛岐，此組織小健全也，後方藥品接濟運輸又不得其法，對于政府又失聯絡，此訓練不得其法也，結果若何？均功虧一簣，貽笑四方，此次抗敵之戰非局部問題，吾人對于救護問題是否仍在畸形狀態下發展抑求政府統制之，前車可鑑亡羊補牢非晚也幸當局注意及之。</p>
<p>（一）組織：爲使應付未來及目前環境起見吾國於首都所在地廳從速組織一永久性之全國防毒救護事業委員會，由政府負責領導之其組織應分爲雙重組織，卽總會之下於各省市縣設立分會，若遇一旦須人應用則可在數分鐘內召集之，平日無事則可作民衆保健及預防工作，此項工作應爲委員制除衛牛機關及軍事當局爲當然委員外，應另聘請專家担任研究工作委員會之下分設各部其組織如下。</p>
<p>（一）總務—專司文書財政庶務之管理及下屬各部事宜。</p>
<p>（二）組織—專司擴充會務及各組與調査登記之工作事宜。</p>
<p>（三）宣傳—專司文字演講出版編輯及情報事宜。　　（四）研究—專司研究各項醫學防毒治療及討論會內進行方針事宜。</p>

<h3>關於熱帶病三個字名詞上的商討（上）</h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>熱帶病三個字，是明顯地拿地理做標準，包含一切在熱帶上發生的病症，卽使屬於世界性的病症，Cosmopililical　Diseases而發生在熱帶區域，也可稱他做熱帶病，反之，在熱帶習見的病症，而發生在寒溫二帶地域內；就邏輯學的原則上講，不能稱他做熱帶病，可是，爲着習慣的便利關係，人們也稱他做熱帶病！舉個例罷！如瘧疾，Malaria是熱帶病學中的重要角色，然而在極寒的俄羅斯北部；也有他的踪跡！</p>
<p>善者！孟松氏，Manson在他的名著熱帶病學Manson＇s　Tropical　Diseases的序言中，開宗明義，劈頭就說『我拿熟帶病這三個字來做此書的名稱，其動機泰半在取共便利而沒有考慮其正確性！The　title　which　I　have　elected　to　give　to　this　work，Tripical　Diseases．is　more　convenient　than　accurate這一句話出之於熱帶病學的當代權威之口，當然是可以做引證的資料了！</p>
<p>在我們多溫少熱地帶立國的中國，帶熱病這個名詞的歷史，還不頂長久，醫學界中對此的注意，也不過是幾十年來的事情，一般社會中上對此的認識，也許只限於現在　常識水平錢以上的先生們，這是跟着醫學史進展有連繫的事實，况且又是近來的舶來品，並不是小子的狂妄，輒敢小覷人們呢　！何况所謂科學化的西醫，在我國只好說還在萌芽時代，這個最後下種，最幼稚的醫學產物，當然還是一個生客</p>
<p>値得我人注意而引動我的指頭筆頭的動機，是教育部醫學教育委員會（記得是這樣的一個公開的機關名稱？（的决議，在這個决議中，把熱帶病這一門科目，列爲醫學生後期必修科目之一，曾經通令全國的專科以上醫學教育機關遵照奉行，特設講座，（這一件事我是祗在報章記載上讀到實情如何都不大明白這樁事情，證明熱帶病在醫學中所佔的地位，此其一。熱帶病在中國有認識的必要，此其二。這一件議案，確立了熱帶病在中國將來發展的基礎，委員們眼光的遠大，計劃的周詳，毅然的决意，眞是可欽可佩。在這裏我行着一個無名小卒心香一瓣式的敬禮！可是話又說回頭，我忽然記着了一句聖人的經言，呌　名正則言順。一切的事物，都需要一個名，形成一切事物本身靜態動態及其意義的總標記。名不正，則非但言不順。恐怕還欲走錯路綫，在革命的今日潮流中順從着習慣的傳統觀念，而把在寒溫地帶也產生的病症，也稱做熱帶病，或至少是把它列入熱帶病，似乎不很合理化！我們有愼重考慮，將他校正，跟重新分配的必要。不能够人云亦云，就此含糊過去，在他人是已有歷史，不易翻身。在我們正當開始，欲把他正名或改造，正是一個絕好的機會呢！</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>

<h3>介紹一種新型醫刊（下）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>的確的，目前的醫界情形，與幾年前的情景，幾乎絲毫沒有變動；所有的醫學刊物中，很少能把脫得了我上述的情形，仍然犯着不上不下的毛病。正眞適合民衆口胃的大衆化的醫刋，固然很少，而切切實實足供醫界同道的　閱，作為臨瞪醫師的精神的食糧的，更其少了。而楊醫師現在所主編的這一種可以說是異軍特出的新型醫刋，就不同了：這不是一般性的通俗，相反地，表明白，這是一種專供醫界同道參閱的專門化的醫刋：待我們看了牠的內容之後，才毫年疑義認定牠是名符其實，確實算保上一種專門化的醫刋，合乎一般醫師診餘之暇的良好讀物。</p>
<p>他這刋物的取材，全是採譯自各國的各種醫學雜誌，所以一種道地的介紹工作。其中更有一個特點，就是牠所有的題材文字，多屬實際的應用，絕少理論方面的探討；正因如此，才更適合於一般臨證醫師的參閱，更有裨益於一般臨瞪醫師的實用。雖然，醫學的理論，也與實際是同樣的重要，一切的實際是少不了理論的根據的；但一般的醫學文字，却往往因理論的冗長而耗費多量的篇幅，確是事實。而就一般診務紛忙的臨證醫師說，往往爲了時間所限，讀牠至不經濟：這正如編者的綠起上所說「每篇讀完，常有無裨實用之憾」的實在情形。編者的毅然創辦了這個刋物，也就看明了這種實際情形：他挺身而任這項媒婆式的　搬運工作，也就爲了一般診務紛忙的臨證醫師，要各人在診務百忙中流覽各種切重理論，缺少實用的醫學雜誌，在時間甚不經濟，甚至於事實上所不允許，然又不能因此而可以缺少了這種日新月異的醫術新知的吸收參閱的緣故哩。他這一個苦心和精神，是很値得我們感佩的！</p>
<p>還有，在他這刋物的編輯上，也有一個很値得注意的地方：在牠的序目中，所有醫療中的各科目，幾乎完全具備：有內科外科，也有婦科小兒科，更有眼耳鼻喉科，以及皮膚，花柳，泌尿等，科目，各科都有幾篇專述的文字。在醫療上的科目上，幾乎是應有盡有的了。這在編者的用心，很顯然地，是要供普通的全科醫師，因可以從各方面都能獲到醫療上的各種新知醫術，卽專門於某某一科兩科的專科醫師，也有他可以參閱的題材資料，這確也是該刋的一個特色之處。</p>
<p>說到牠的內容文字呢，確屬篇篇新穎深佩其選擇之精，譯筆也能信達明晚。如果編者以後都能本此精神做去，我相信，是能達到使讀「讀一篇卽有一篇之用，讀一期卽有「期之益」的這一個目的的。</p>
<p>至於其中各精彩處，我不能在這兒多費篇幅，逐一作介了；還請讀者自己去直接領受吧</p>
<p>我得到了這一份新型醫刋現代診療譯叢之後，好像編者替我還了我幾年來所拖欠下來的一筆債欵做的心頭一舒。</p>
<p>最後，我還得附帶一句：該刋的定價，雖非過昂，然如能爲普及定戶起見，再將定價低减一點，那末讀者也一定能够增多起來的。定戶增多，讀者普遍之後，該刋的效力，該刋的發展，亦就會越加宏大而迅速了。</p>
<p>我除了在此將這一份寶貴的禮物－現代診療譯叢－沉重地介紹於全國醫界的讀者之外，並視該刋的前程無量！（完）</p>

<h3>紗花　變動莫測　紗花大紊亂</h3>
<p>跌得兇漲得更兇　漲得快跌得更快　結果是　紗漲五元餘　棉高一元許</p>
<p>紗市兎起　落、局勢異常紊亂、蓋以西安事態嚴重、人心驚惶不定、證券狂跌、但有一部份投機商、益覺活動、因此市面狂漲猛跌、至現紗實際交易亦甚缺乏、本月成交雖有一千四百包外、大半含投機性質、前途殊乏把握、</p>
<p>市價上落甚鉅</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因西安事變嚴重、人心紊亂、十二月期猛瀉五元一角、一月期跌一元九角、拍至二三月期、市况急變、買風濃烈、傳言紛起、買者蜂擁而來、狂漲五元半至六元半、二盤開拍十二月期飛騰十二元、為二百六十元、一月亦跳九元、二月勿動、三月期回跌五角、迨至三收盤、獲利者了結、稍形回挫、市塲混亂不堪、標紗結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲四元至六元四角、午後延至三時開盤、氣勢尚緊、二盤後、因多頭了結、市價回落、迨至收盤、稍形回漲、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一元半、遠期平定、查賣了錦昌四千二百包、昶記一千一百包、合興一千二百五十包、德大一千一百五十包、聚興三千六百包、義成二千五百包、泰昌一千八百包、益昶一千六百包、長豐一千五百五十包、協成一千七百包、買進裕大一千包、大孚二千八百包、恒益三千六百包、明德二千三百包、興昌一千七百包、森康一千九百五十包、愼記五千七百五十包、大昌成六千四百包、潤康三千七百包、大昶二千七百包、福康一千二百五十包、達記一千包、茲將一日間行市比較及存賬數列後、</p>

<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計一千四百二十包、售價漲五元、　漲七元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市受時局影響、又有一說、外埠花價大漲、隴海路運貨不通、一般神經過敏者謂、棉花來源發生問題、於是買氣尤激、遠月漲出五元開外云、</p>
<p>期棉前市至二時收盤</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因遠期紗回升、市傳浮言繁興、皆屬利多、買勢殊强、各月猛跳一元三四角、二盤以後、仍形平靜、迨至三收盤、微見回挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元零五分至一元四角、拍至二時始吿收盤、午後開盤、市情轉平、因上午漲風過激、引起獲利者了結、　回挫、迨至收盤又復回上、結果本月比上午收盤價跌六角、遠跌一角、查賣出聚興一萬四千担、明德一萬一千四百担、泰昌四千担、潤康一萬三千六百担、協成一萬六千八百担、福康七千九百担、益康九千八百担、吉豐五千八百担、振大九千一百担、福源三千七百担、益昶三千七百担、信誠七千五百担、買進、合興二萬零八百担、遠記五千一百担、大豐五千七百担、大孚五千五百担、裕大五千八百担、森康五千四百担、興昌五千二百担、大昌成一萬零三百担、大昶一萬一千四百担、長和二萬七千担、益昶四千六百担、茲將一日間行市比較及存賬數列後、</p>

<h3>證券　公債一拍卽停　經紀人請停市未許　開盤後固跌勢非常</h3>
<p>昨日公債市塲、為環境上忽起劇烈變動、市價一致暴跌、市塲人心、亦極形混沌、檯頂上滿佈著恐慌氣象、多頭大多均多斬割、時見售出、市價於風聲鶴唳之局勢籠罩下、因吸收籌碼、驟見絕跡、一律下降、統行停拍、蓋自有統一各債開拍以來之創舉、當上午開盤、因時局之嚴重趨惡、經紀人公會、因深恐劇變、曾召集各經紀人會議、有申請交易所理事會及監理員停拍之舉、惟以事出於預料、至十時後照常開拍、然後形勢凶险、人氣倉惶、買戶頓見絕跡、市價一致猛跌、逾出四元、竟吿停杯、惟多頭急於斬割、於暗盤中再跌一二元、賣出者甚湧、故趨勢頹靡之狀、狀屢少有、及至午後、因有謠言之轉後、散戶空頭亦起抵補、暗盤略趨回升、與停板行市相等、但為　境尚多嚴緊變化、而債市現尚昂居價高、今日恐難平復、九六公債、初因人心慌張、晨初開盤竟跌至六元、亦為兩年來之最低價、惟後經十四號及散戶之收購、於二三四盤逐步回升、至七元半左右收市、全日結果、一致猛挫三元七角半至四元零五分、九六亦小一元一角半、成交總計一千七百七十五萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油頓呈觀望</h3>
<p>白桐油、漢市因到不敷鉅、現油最俏、市面亦逐步遞加、前週售洋荘尚在每擔四十八元五角遞升至五十元、乃上週又由五十元零五角而五十一元而至五十一元五角矣、昨日雖為星期、本無市面、然市塲上形勢仍非常俏俐、惟聞西安事變後、恐由時局影響及於金融、商業當有轉變之　、桐油縱　對外貿易、國內銷塲不無關係、故市况未可預卜、浙江方面、前昨兩日尚做每擔五十二元江交、而杭州行家在本埠售申交須五十二元七八角及五十三元、昨日得到時局消息後、賣買均不接談、似入停頓狀態矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　華絲出口不振</h3>
<p>六個月間較减一萬五千包</p>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報吿十一月份蠶絲出口、計輸出白廠絲六、二一三包、黃絲經二〇七包、黃土絲三一二包、灰絲一七六包、雙喜絲一九五包、其計七、四七六包、較十月份之四、三二二包、增加三、一五四包、惟本年六月以來輸出總數二五、七九六包、較去年同期則仍相差一四、九五七包、足見華絲輸出之衰落、愈趨嚴重、茲列十一月份統計於左、</p>
<p>註：本年份係自民國廿五年六月至廿七年五月</p>
<p>去年份係自民國廿四年六月至廿五年五月</p>
<h3>洋荘絲經仍少轉機</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、僅橫濱有市、絲價依然疲跌、殊無生氣、計現貨較上週六跌一〇元、期貨跌一六元、申埠洋荘絲市、仍未有轉機、用戶絲銷、亦覺微尠、行盤下跌五元强、全日售開僅二十五包、絲市人心頗感消沉、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白成交大增</h3>
<p>昨稱市以時局關係、趨勢特緊、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨呌二十一元六角半、比升一角、轉口貨六元二角、比升八分、東白亦轉升、現貨四號J嘜二十一元六角半、比升八角半、八號N嘜二十一元三角、比升一角八分、均有成交、轉口貨四號呌六元四角、八號六元二角、九號六元、現貨二十一元一角、比前日均漲一角、本廠綿白振記金心大華等一號均二十元四角、號貨有廣潮龍開出新祝靑五十包、貨頗佳、價為十四元、海南赤一百十八包、十四元一角、比升一角、本廠一號冰二十五元四角、二號二十五元三角、</p>

<h3>南北貨　漢市湘蓮劃申不合</h3>
<p>湘蓮近來漢市頗緊、故劃申雜合、如較高之貨漢價需四十二三元、查此間行盤以銷路不旺、趨勢較平、衡州等貨四十三元左右、頂上湘潭四十六七元、白蓮到存均稀、申售四十七元、交易亦稀、</p>
<h3>五金　五金內外交易驟停</h3>
<p>自蔣委員長在西安被張學良刦持之後、申市五金交易突呈慘黯狀態、蓋　家客帮均停止辦貨、而同業對於海外定貨交易、亦吿斷絕、是以昨市情形頗現冷落、昨市外匯驟軟、故業此者頗蒙不利、倘來日時局再不轉機、則五金業前途、恐不易樂觀、</p>
<h3>呢絨　駱駝羢銷路何好</h3>
<p>駱駝羢國貨中實緊條　之下檔一元一二角者、漢口帮大有裝辦、均做大帮號衣裏子之用、致近日市面突好、長毛駝羢卽海白龍、又名開摩太克斯、現頗風行、時新男女定製大衣、多用此料、十元許者殆盡、除某公司外、存貨亦少、雙面黃駝羢銷路亦極暢、奈日貨到存充斥、價仍下游、</p>
<h3>時勢所造成之糧食非常市面</h3>
<p>小麥已發見數十年來未有之高價　粉價節節上漲遠期皆出四元三角　紅糧苞米油餅蔴豆漲度皆屬非常　獨米價除薄稻外客秈轉呈停頓狀</p>
<p>粉價四三三</p>
<p>昨日粉市、又見　大風波、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近漲三角零、遠漲九角零、坎拿大漲三四六角、當開價時、以洋麥報漲、而陜方突起變亂、一般以時局不靖、麵粉行市、當然看高、本月份開價尚平、祗好二三分、一二月份則亟漲七八分、但至三四月份、則又突漲至一角之限度、人心因時局而激昂、又為市塲增一種新資料也、迨至下午開盤、本月份及一月份、尚在限度之內、二月份起則均漲一角、因此人心雖昂、交易則已趨冷落、往後情形、當以時局澄淸為轉移云、</p>

<p>麥價七一二</p>
<p>期麥開盤、亦一致騰漲激昂、其原因亦同上述、以為於小麥來源、當然影響甚巨、故開價後、各月份喊價一致激昂、計近期漲近角、遠期漲一角零、迨下午開盤、近期因事實不致缺貨、人心尚定、遠期則因外匯轉縮、人心愈緊、致漲度亦較鉅、一月份至四月份計漲一角二至一角九分、三四月份之最高價、均高至七元一角二分、此種紀錄、實為幾十年來所未一見也、現麥市情、亦殊緊張、廠方進胃尚活、山東麥開至六元八角半、次八角、七角半不等、由福新申大阜豐辦一萬五千包云、</p>

<p>油餅旣飛騰</p>
<p>昨日標準油豆餅一變、業外買氣更旺、一般人尚恐有意外之變化、乃亟亟收買、兼之大連電訊報漲、並傳國際間油豆需要增加、因之　油收價較漲五角左右至七角、標豆激漲一角一分至五分、標餅亦跟漲三五分、</p>
<p>豆油價更昂</p>
<p>豆油市况、不脫大連數度狂跳之影響、蓋以各產區供應不足、洋荘銷塲勢若鯨呑、致大連取引所行情新高價層出、本市　之激盪、刻下本市內地去路、均有年底備冬之需、市價更得扶搖直上、昨晨先因標準趨軟、賣買相持、入後大連劇升、標準與現貨疾驅猛進、結果飛漲九角至一元、成交各油九百餘件、花生油亦然、橫升三四角、計成交一千六百件、</p>
<p>雜糧無不貴</p>
<p>本市各糧價、受世所造之劇烈漲風、為勢頗猛、似紅糧（卽高粱籽）已開四元一角外之價、綠豆均出五元大關、苞米須四元二三角、故黃豆市面更形奔騰、昨市郯城豆比上週六再砌一角、價為五元九角半、由榨油廠辦去三千五百包、新安鎭豆八百包、現廠胃雖無暢流之狀、然趨勢不懈、其餘各豆漲六七分不等、去路由本街內地及南洋帮等問津各豆三千餘包、芝蔴市之尖銳勢無喝止、昨沙市蔴開十二元、較前市足　七角、其他各蔴均砌三四角、統市交易、各蔴一千二百包、洋荘凈貨因無供給、致未做開、大勢趨漲、固不在毛貨之下、</p>
<p>米價獨平常</p>
<p>昨日南市到米船百十餘號、共米二萬三千餘石、其中薄稻八十餘號、天雨濛濛、人心轉好、本道銷塲稍佳、薄稻包子初呆後動、計辦去萬餘包、行情高起五分、中關貨升一角、厚粳只有零星交易、行市平定、杜洋尖及陰變元悉屬相仿、北市到船二十四五號、反因陰雨、致少交易、市價亦無甚榮辱、客秈續見平疲、因邇日長江來源不絕、而去化日减、更因陜　變化、河南陜西一帶均經停辦、到頭仍有萬包左右、昨日成交祗四千許、除油頭辦去湘米二千二百六十一包外、本街亦應酬江西溫台各米二千包左右、其他均無交易、滬南米市、因本年以薄稻銷路為最、故市面凌駕閘北而上之、且以碼頭設備完全、故昨日雖雨、交易仍能照常進行、不似北市之冷靜、惟昨日市上銀根已見緊、今日交易恐不能如往日之熱鬧也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布市亦極混沌　廠方停止出售各貨　客戶購辦亦呈觀望</h3>
<p>昨棉布市况、以西安發生重大變端、商塲形勢亦極混沌、晨市標紗開盤猛跌五元、出人意外、業中心思不一、怡和廠十六磅五福雙象十四磅、單鹿藍雞首先報跌一·二角、輕磅粗布售盤如故、成交一百數十包、餘貨亦略有小額成交售盤平平、實以賣買方意態不定、均呈觀望之象、未幾標紗二盤條跳起十二元、廠方卽停止出售各貨、日商洋行停止客家出取棧單、因之現棧單及現貨驟形俏俐、喊價不一、午後標紗花逐漸回跌、日商洋行細布斜按上週市市盤加一角左右稍有開出、市情略形平定、小額交易、起每疋五分至一角、然市上大多數貨目、以廠家無意開價、客戶亦無堅决買進意思、交易陷於呆頓云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳鐵吾）</p>
<p>人生旣是宇宙舞台前被排定的一個角色，在這非常時期裏，就應多演幾齣「薛仁貴征東」和「漢光武復國」。</p>
<p>「山伯訪友」「隔墻相會」，這一類充滿桃色趣味的活動，固然也是人生所不可免的、但「人為刀俎，我爲魚肉·」在這連我們立足的舞台也快要毀滅的現在，生存已發生絕大的問題，那容你在芙蓉帳裏，安閒的度着「愛」中生活呢？</p>
<p>茫茫的人海裏，這一幕人生的戲，正正經經扮做岳武穆的，固不乏人：但塗起了花臉，演奸臣秦檜的，亦大有人在；流芳遺臭，歷史家的筆下，最寫得分明。</p>
<p>戲越唱得精采，留在觀眾腦膜上的印象越深刻；人生越幹得田轟轟烈烈，博得人家的信仰也愈深。</p>
<p>要想在人生短短的程途上，留下一些痕跡，就應當打起精神，演這幕人生的戲。</p>
<h3>初冬遊龍華</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>是一個初冬的星期日，我是孤獨地，邁開了輕鬆的步子，踏上了龍華道。</p>
<p>在這木葉盡脫的季節中，漫遊以桃花稱勝的龍華，似乎似太無謂了，然而我覺得，春季，是龍華的飛黃騰達之時，是一臉的得意與倨傲，在現在這個季節中，才能見到龍華的本來面目。在燈紅酒綠之間，欣賞臉上煊染着一厚層脂粉的美人，我以為還不如欣賞一個不施脂粉的村婦，或許還能實際的領略得二三分的天然的美麗。這便是我去觀賞一下在寒威籠罩之下的龍華的動機。</p>
<p>一步一步的挨着近龍華，像拳兒也似的一個個桃樹枝兒，靜靜地高擎着，站在路旁的桃園裡。雖然在暮春季節中，我曾見這化學分析　桃椿兒上，都披上了錦繡也似的紅花綠葉，受盡了遊人的贊頌，然而今天，我是見到了他們的本來面目了，他們的灰黑而龜裂的樹皮，是那麼的憔悴得毫無生意，正像美人早起，臉兒是萎黃得怕人。「桃花紅粉」，「美人骷髏」，一切可作如是觀。</p>
<p>暮春季節中，龍華道上，是裙屐翩翩，馬輪如水，可是在這初冬裏，遊人是難得見到一二了。沿途所見的，不是西裝的先生們，高跟履的太太們，點綴在這寂寞的龍華道上的，只是些荷鋤担荣的村農，以及坐在籬邊門首，補綴哺乳的農婦而已。此外，就不過是些鷄鳴狗吠，雀噪鷹啼，和着龍華寺的鐘聲，混凝而成的一片家村天籟。雖然有時也還有一輛二輛流綫型的汽車，疾馳而過，然而也不過是偶然的一輛二輛而已，在事實上，還不足以破壞却林子間的縷縷炊煙，所交織成的一幅初冬的美麗風景畫，一幅富有中古趣味的風景畫。</p>
<p>於是乎我想，再過幾天，白雪飄上大地，飄上了每一個桃椿，飄上了古寺，飄上了那個塔兒，飄上了週遭的竹籬茅舍，整個龍華，完全沉浸在銀色也似的白雪中，其淡裝素抹的風韻，或許是比了三四月間的一片嫣紅，是更値得留戀。但是上海人，是喜歡趕熱鬧的，下雪天，若是有誰趕上龍華去，那準會給人笑是瘋子。所以只聽人往龍華看桃花，沒有往龍華賞雪的。</p>
<p>初冬的龍華，我是欣賞着了，但是，我在歸途中，我不住地在肚子裏盤算着，再過些時待老天扯下了白絮也似的瑞雪，掩蔽住了整個龍華時，我準得再到這裏來，印上幾個足印，勿使村農僧侶，獨自飽飫了雪後的龍華風光。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅事報相思</p>
<p>國器點點頭道：李小姐又重言以申明之了。交朋友要誠實，他這種態度是對的，李小姐的話也是對的。友梅抿嘴微微一笑，似乎他也帶有一點羞態了，將臉微揚着向了天花板，因道：表哥對於這個消息，有什麼感想。哦！我衝過了，又重問一句。嘻嘻。國器也是一笑。將摺扇收起，在手心裡微微的敲打着，放出很沉着的樣子，皺了眉道：小姐們有了這樣的事，當然總是不幸。不過汪小姐的對方不知是怎麼一個人才？若是相配得過，縱然婚姻不是自己的意思，究竟還不差什麼分寸。友梅道：這個我雖不十分明白，但是聽說那個人在上海　書，很貪玩，讀書只是掛幌子罷了。表哥想想罷浮浪子弟，和怎能說到一外。古言道得好，名花落溷，我看萝蘭，也　成了落溷之花了。國器笑道:那也太言重。友梅道：雖然我比得厲害一點。但是也替他可惜起來，覺得還不止如此。國器微微的歎了一口氣。友梅笑道：我是來拿回信的，表哥的回信呢？國器道：像我所送的那點東西，已經不用送去了這一信……　着這話，眼睛望到書桌上，友梅是隨？他的眼光看過來，便笑道：照樣也是這樣的小信封。國器臉色正了一正道：李小姐，我們雖不常見你必能了解我，我不是那種損人利己的人。江小姐現在旣是這樣苦惱，我若再送東西給他，那是說友誼進步。同時呢，彼此友誼進步，反　他的婚姻不圓滿，那不是去安慰他，那去加重他的苦惱。友梅說突然的問上一句話道：那麼，表哥對他的友誼打算，就從此終了嗎？他問話的聲音是提高了一點，胸脯子也隨着向上一挺，表示一種證據加強的意味。國器原來的話，是說得很順嘴的，一氣直下。到了這時，也突然語塞了竟是向友梅望着說不出話來。友梅道：不但此也，萝蘭旣然不避嫌疑，送了表哥一樣很珍貴的東西。怎麼表哥倒是安然受之，並不回禮呢？國器道：我覺得……在這三個字下面他又無法繼續，只是把摺扇展開，在胸面前很　輕的揮着。友梅看他那樣子，又對微微笑了一笑。便站起來又半側了身子向他看一看，因道：表哥，你桌止這個小小的信封，可以讓我拿走吧嗎？（一一〇）</p>
<h3>借壽討壽</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>世俗有向神道借壽之舉。這雖是迷信，然因出於孝恩或其能愚誠，故人遂不以爲非。譬如父或母染着重病，而醫生亦俱吿束手了　那時爲人子的因人事已盡，無法回天，一時爲孝恩所衝動，遂不得已向當坊土地虔誠祝吿，願減己壽，以益親年。這原是渺茫的。幸而父或母命不該絕，朝病愈了；於是什麼酬神演劇哩還願上匾哩，遂視爲天經地義之事，否則便是褻瀆神明，不是玩的</p>
<p>某甲酷信神佛，鄉裡都稱爲水善士。那年，他母親病了，大病了，且中西醫生亦俱回絕了。某甲真急得什麼似的，因暗向當坊土地禱吿，—據說還寫下陰狀的—願減壽十年，以益母壽。也不知是神道果有靈威，還是某母陽壽未盡，居然伊的病體竟日痊一日了。事後，他們母子倆自然歡天喜地，要進香上匾，以答神府：且從此之後，某甲俱被隣裡親戚們稱爲孝子，而某甲亦當之無愧！</p>
<p>這還是十年前的事。那末，十年之後，這位孝子又「孝」得怎麼樣呢？這位孝子因娶妾，嫖妓，納外室等事，時向鞭母索錢。初猶軟索，繼以硬索；不遂其意，則拍桌大罵，我欲一拳打死老母而後快。一天，某甲竟異想天開，突向其母索還壽債。伊因說道：「餘壽十年，我已活過來了，呌我怎樣還給你呢」？這位孝子因示以還壽之法，謂先備陰狀向原土地聲請，然後再把匾額除下。這樣神明自有辦法了，</p>
<p>迄今某甲還在嚷　「討壽，還壽」，此一筆債不知何時可了哩！</p>
<h3>麪　神聖</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>本市援綏運動印象</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>上海的市民，對於維持國家民族生存的自衛素來是很熱誠地擁護　援助的；這從上海一二八抗戰和東北義勇軍抗敵等經過中，已經　了充分的表現了。到了目前，外侮雖然愈加鵬通，而民衆的愛國情緒亦愈益激昂，那只要看最近的綏遠吿警，我們前線將士的歷勇抗敵，與後方民衆的熱烈援助，便可得到一個有力的敎訓！</p>
<p>綏遠是我們的國防最前綫，同時，也是我們的國防最後綫；因爲，要是這一條防綫給敵人破壞之後，我們的國家就會不能再保，然而，我們的決心抗戰，卻非從這條防綫上抗起不可，因爲它是東北四省失陷及冀察事件發生後；我國中原的最後屏障。這關係國運最後存亡的綏邊戰事，終於由　　多　而揭開了大戰的序幕；並且那興奮的，血腥的消息，從那凜冽的西北風中，從那各地報紙上傳過來，　百　廟克復，匪僞反攻失敗，匪軍反正，敵　轟炸鳥蘭花，塞外殺寒，氣候降至零下三十七度………而前方守士將士矢忠保國，捍衛疆土的熱忱，較過去抗敵情形尤爲　壯，所以自　戰備一啟，華北及各地的援綏運動，和慰勞將士者就風起云勇，熱烈響應了。</p>
<p>尤其令人欣慰興奮的是，我們每天在報上讀到許多値得感動的新聞，譬如：各地獄囚的絕食助捐，小販車夫能及乞丐的節食賣獻國家，兒童的省下糖菓玩具費援綏，本市各團　各廠商發起的一日運動，一角運動，一元運動，甚至一篇（稿費）運動，婦女界也在宣傳捐款，及捐贈絨衫，棉衣，手套，耳袋等……這些，這些，都在風靡一時地盛行着。到目前爲止，就拿上海埠的援綏捐欵來說，總數已在百萬以上了，於此可見那種破天荒　熱烈情緒，表現出了民族自救的眞精神。</p>
<p>每天，報紙上吿訴了我們前綫捷音之外，還報吿給我們許多團體，廠商，及機關中的捐欵情形和捐欵數目；在那些捐欵里面，有富翁袋裡的　吝錢，有小販，車夫，工人的汗血錢，有太太小姐們的脂粉錢，數目大的有數千數萬，數目小的有幾分幾毛。而且，這幾天隨便走在什麼地方，都可聽到一串關於綏遠情形和援綏捐欵的談話。這次的援綏運動，可以說是全國上下男女老幼的總動員了。雖然不曾貼過什麼標語，不曾喊過什麼口號，但在每一個民眾的激昂情緒上，每一個國民的興奮談話中，便能得到那永遠不能應滅的深刻印象！</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>廣西的回憶</h3>
<p>— 樊桐山</p>
<p>南下視察商業之動機，遠在一年前，良以粵桂兩省年來努力建設，得有極好成績，興辦工廠事業，日益增廣，頗爲國人所稱譽，而蘊藏之富，更足供研究經濟者以絕好的市井資料。本年夏，友人鄧世雄君，有往該兩省作實地考察之議，因與結伴同行，相約假道星埠順赴安南而至河內，再由鎮南關往龍州轉　，途經柳梧兩州而到粵省。作長途之考察，惟以時間所限，在星埠安南等處，躭擱兩星期，卽由河內到鎮南關，假道龍州赴邕，在龍州起程，係坐汽車到達南寗，費時不過四句釧，即抵目的地，我等到該地係七月八日，斯時正值該省作抗×救亡之時期，南寗地面，一變而爲最重要區域，軍事佈防，形勢吃緊，往來該地者，均受檢查，我等初抵該處，驟聞抗×救國之呼聲，不覺興奮起來。</p>
<p>我記得還有一樣最奇突的事，就是南寗市面高有人力車，（梧州則有人力車而沒有公共汽車）而獨有公共汽車，問他的原故，據說是李白他們的政令，也就是人道和平等主義，所以不許設置人力車，公共汽車係各馬路都有，出入卻很便利，並且規定每十數分鍾之內，必須有一部汽車經過各站，便得乘車者不致久等，同時軍人另有軍用公共汽車，也是規定時間往來，各路有站，凡屬乘坐該車，是不要車資，係中政府給欵的，所以民用公共汽車內，是沒有一個軍人往來，但車資也很便宜，比較上海經濟得多了。</p>
<p>南寗的民風很儉樸也很講禮義，商號交易也是客氣得很，百姓們不論老的少的，都要受過軍事訓練，很有勇武的精神，全省一律「武裝化」，在軍事戒備時期，就可以立刻編成民團，等到軍事解嚴了，也就馬上復員，仍操舊業，這就是遵照孫總理所謂化兵爲農的遺訓，也就是白健生氏所行的三自政策。至於婦女們，亦受軍訓，並且都很樸實，也是穿布服的多，化妝品是少有光顧，出外來的婦女們一律是本來面目，表現也一種自然美，沒有搽脂抹粉和那種妖冶的怪象，這在國內是開婦女界的新紀錄，最近組織的民團，婦女參加的很多，他們的工作，是救護隊居多，其他如服務軍師旅各部的政治和幹部的工作，也很不少，綜之民眾的精神，能到這般地步，是他們主政者的統治精神也就是民眾們擁戴服從的結果。</p>
<p>桂省自厲行新政以來，在省內竪立四大區的標誌，卽梧州爲商業處，南寗爲政治區，柳州爲工業區，桂林爲文化區者是，我們一到柳州，又是一番新的景象。</p>
<p>梧州爲文本商業集中之區，街市繁盛，建築宏麗，四週皆山，街道亦多在山坡築路，江水貫流，風景殊佳，有省辦之桐油廠，製藥廠，自來水廠，及兩廣合辦之硫酸廠等，我們遊覽全市，及參觀各工廠，以桐油廠營業較爲發過，製藥廠則分化騐製藥兩部，於去年一月間開辦，秩序井然，極有精神。</p>
<p>桂林環城皆山，加以灕江沿岸，更有許多清溪危澗，觸目成景白，看不厭，所謂桂林山水甲天下誠非虛語，我們在桂林因時間所限，只有幾天的時間，遊覽名勝古跡，正如走馬看花，僅得大槪，後來我們就參觀幾個中等學校，辦理都很嚴，成績是不必說，當然很好的，那裏的學生一律穿着灰布的軍服，走起路來雄糾糾氣昂昂的，都有尚武的精神，完全受過軍訓，象徵着他們就是新中國的棟樑，復興民族的柱石。</p>
<p>廣西的行政設施，完全根據前年黨政軍聯席會議通過的「廣西建設綱領」辦裡，廣西的建設綱領一共有二十七條條文，內分政治，經濟，文化，軍事，等四大原則，都是實際的指南針，並非空洞的宣傳，講到他們的政治建設，現在已健全政治基層，推進各種建設事業，並厲行，發揚公正廉潔的政治風尚，提高行政交通，實施公務員訓練，以上種種，均見諸事實，已有相當的政績可以證明。</p>

<h3>西安事變與援綏</h3>
<p>— 史揖</p>
<p>在綏遠的戰事還祗吿一段落，敵人正預備迫使他的傀儡來捲土重犯的時候，不幸得很的，却讓我們見到了西安的非常事變。</p>
<p>關於西安事變的處置，國府的十三日明令裏已明白地吿訴了我們：「此次西安事變，政府自有適當之處置，所有京內外各機關一切政務，仍本旣定方針，照常進行，全國人民，亦應各安生業，毋得輕信謠言，自相紛擾，……」。我們自然不必「自相紛擾」。但由於西安事變所引起的影響，由於西安事變所給予前綫將士和後方民眾的打擊，我們却是無法否認的。</p>
<p>由於西安事變的發生，我們在今天報上就可以看到已經有好幾個援綏團體的緊要傳言决定「展期召集了。緊要傳言召集雖並不是就是馬上產生了援綏的力量，但因為「展期」而把援綏的力量也「展期」了，則是事實。</p>
<p>而另一方面，因為我們國內的事變所誘致，敵人將乘隙來攻，也將成為必然的事實；一方面我們旣已减損了援綏的力量，而另一方面，却又加緊了敵人的壓迫，試問這樣下去，將會發展至如何局面？</p>
<p>如果敵人來侵，綏遠的將士們將更奮勇的抗敵，那是我們所深信的。西安的事變，有國府諸公約「適當之處置」，將化干戈為玉帛，也是我們所願望，所相信。所以，西安事變的發生，雖足使我們的感情一時趨於惶惑，而經過理知的衡量，我們却應該因為西安事變的發生，而更脚踏實地的幹下云。為事變所惶惑震駭的，　非惟與事變的解决無補，並且更足使事變趨於紛擾。</p>
<p>基於上面這點認識，因之敢向全國同胞進以懇切的忠吿：我們不要因為國內非常的事變，而惶惶不可終日，忽略了對外的抗敵。反之，正因為事變之來，將誘致外敵更大的壓迫，我們該更集中力量來積極奮鬥，來為垂危的祖國爭生存！</p>
<p>所以，援綏運動，如果並非迫不得已，我們不僅不該展期召集，並且還應該「提早召集」；不僅應該照常的援助綏遠，並且還應該盡更大的力量來援助綏遠！</p>
<p>我們應該用事實來向各國昭吿：中國人民，卽使是在國內非常的事變中，還是有力量來抵禦外來的侵略的！</p>
<h3>金沙江</h3>
<p>— 函谷</p>
<p>伴着金沙江的人們，是看慣了江上景色的。</p>
<p>曉光呑食了黑暗，雞聲繚繞在江岸的樹梢。江上披起一層薄霧，在遠處交織成一道朦朧的綱子，和遠山一齊糢糊了。朝霞絢爛的畫染天邊，像一塊塊殘破的鮮紅的地毯，像一堆堆嬌艷爛縵的桃花瓣，揭穿了白霧，映着鏡子般的江水，在水里印着淡紅色的浮動的雲彩，和搖撼的山，蓊鬰的叢林，岸邊點頭的楊柳。江邊的路上，樹林里，不時送來一兩聲趕馬人的呼哨，和驢騾叮噹的嚮鈴。山上叢林里，斫柴人唱起山歌，浮蕩着天眞的笑聲，漸漸的江材的炊烟，縷縷升起，陽光輕悄的吻着江面，金沙江更燦爛了。水底好像開着一片桃花林</p>
<p>月夜，金沙江變淸瘦了。白的月光映在白的水上，江面茫茫一片，好像十里平原。微風吹起水上的漣漪，麥浪般的波紋，一層層的起伏着，江底的山，叢林，搖籃似的擺動。江村的狗吠，和着山上的狼號，由高處反　回來，月光和金沙江更凄淸了。漁人點着火把，拿着又，守着綱，等魚籃里裝滿了活魚，唱着山歌回去了。明早賣了魚，打兩斤燒酒，喝他個昏昏醉。</p>
<p>秋風吹着江面的時候，金沙江換上了一件碧綠色的夾襖，印花水底的天空，和江水分不出顏色。山上紅樹襯着綠的江水，更鮮艷了。枯黃的柳葉，一片片被風吹到江上，隨波浪飄漾着，江邊的大石頭漸漸的露了出來。水一天比一天淸而且淺了。江村的婦女，坐在大石頭上洗着衣服，直到太陽徧西，才背起大包袱，和着山上放牛娃兒的歌曲，踏着殘陽回去。</p>
<p>若是楊花漂泊的季節，金沙江豐膄些了。野花點綴着靜靜矗立的山。一些不知名的蟲，悄悄的在草上爬過。畫眉，斑鳩，在林叢裏跳躍着，歡愉的，朗朗的唱着各樣的調子，羊帬，零散的蹓跶在花江邊的柳林里，　　的唱着悲歌，無邪的陶醉，花綠色的大自然中，把江上的景色渲染得更醉人了。</p>
<p>布榖鳥在叢林中把暑熱呌出來，金沙江喘息着，好像快要臨盆的孕婦，天上黑雲馳騁着，一個豁閃，打江面掠過，刮拉拉一聲炸雷，大雨便傾入江中了。於是江上，山間，混成白茫茫一片，但太陽一出來，江又變了樣子。</p>
<h3>參觀上海養魚工學圃</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>昨天，到大塲去參觀了上海養魚工學圃。</p>
<p>我們到餘慶橋下了車，問了好多個信，繼找到了楊樹園。照例，我們把自己的來意向那園主說明了之後，他就派了一個人去把魚塲的門開了，引導着我們去參觀。</p>
<p>魚塲是在園的對面，大約有二畝多地方，傍邊也有一個園，但還在計劃建築中。魚池的位置本來是一條小河流的支梢，經他們加了一番改造，及在一端築了一個壩，使它和那條河流隔絕後，便成了一個長形的魚蕩了。這池並不怎樣深，水最深的時候不過二丈，現在祗有一丈來往，池裏的魚秧現已放有五種，白魚，靑魚，鯤魚，鯉魚，鰱魚，其中白魚最多，靑魚次之。獲利方面要算鰱魚最厚，鯉魚的利益最薄，因為鰱魚的生長旣迅速，飼料又普通，平均八個月卽可起水出售了。</p>
<p>現在，他們池裏的魚秧共有一千五百尾，每尾大約已有四五兩，不過目前還在試辦時期內，一切設備還非常簡陋</p>
<p>那兒的地位很好，水源不　有缺乏或過剩之時，因為池的傍邊就有一條河流，一灣綠水，幾枝垂楊，要是在春光明媚的季節，或長日炎炎夏天，這風景我相信一定是很可愛的。</p>
<p>參觀過了魚池，又回到楊樹園裏，該園面積約佔地三畝來往，四周用板籬築着圍牆，中間聳立着一座洋樓，和一座矮矮的工役房，那裏一半是園藝圃，及養雞園，還有一半，他們現正在開池挖穴，預備養美國種珍貴巨蛙。</p>
<p>到各處去參觀過了之後，那位園主人便又把我們請到了會客室裏，同時他吿訴我們，他是廣東人，因為他本人對於農村副業很有興趣研究，尤其是覺得養魚，在我國實在是一椿値得提倡的事業。</p>
<p>一畝魚池大約可養魚二千尾至四千</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>尾，一年起池一次，魚的生長速度，鰱魚每年可長一斤餘，靑魚白魚等大約一斤，鯉魚則祗十兩至十一兩，其普通飼料大都是水草之類，其他便是荳餅及各種軟體動物。每畝池子年約需費一百元至二百元，而收穫亦有二百元至四百元，照此推算，一畝魚池年約可餘一二百元之譜，而苟在十畝魚池管理則一年亦可有一二千元之進益了。</p>
<p>魚池在湖濱等處的，每個至少五畝以上，然而管魚池者最怕的是大水，及池中闖入黑魚，因為這些都是養魚家的災星。</p>
<p>他們池裏這些魚秧據說全是由蘇州等處運來的，但是無論那個池子都不必放鯽魚種，其日後自會有鯽魚的，那原因是鯽魚可由水中搶入，或從水草中帶進了魚籽，在池裏孵化的。</p>
<p>題那「養魚工學圃」的動機，將來是計劃讓一般有志於魚業的同志，全有實習機會，但目前還正在進行籌備中。</p>

<h3>In Order to Rescue Mr. Chiang, Dundas Flew to Xi'an Yesterday Afternoon. Zhang Xueliang Telegraphed to Nanjing Saying that Qian Dajun Had Died. Feng Qin'zai Telegraphed to Yu Youren, Expressing Ignorance. Zhang Xueliang's Artillery Regiment Stationed in Xuzhou Disarmed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Advisor Dundas flew west from Luoyang by plane on the morning of the 14th and landed in Xi'an at 2 pm. Nanjing has received a telegram from relevant parties and expects a follow-up report on the 15th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Chiang's advisor Dundas flew from Luoyang to Xi'an on the morning of the 14th. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dundas and Huang Renlin flew to Luoyang on the 13th. It is said that they flew from Luoyang to Xi'an on the morning of the 14th, according to evening newspapers. When Huang and Dundas flew to Shaanxi, friends in Luoyang sent a plane to escort them. According to the original plane's report upon returning to Luoyang, the plane carrying Dundas and Huang arrived in Xi'an at 10 am, and it was confirmed that many people from Xi'an were at the airport to welcome them. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xi'an Telegraph of the 14th is still unable to communicate. It is said that the Longhai Railway Bureau stopped selling passenger tickets yesterday and today. The Eurasia Company's plane flying from Shanghai to Chengdu on the 14th was also suspended due to the Shaanxi incident. The Beijing Company received a telegram from Shanghai, notifying all post offices to suspend airmail to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Shaanxi, Chongqing, and Chengdu. As for express and registered mail sent to Xi'an and Lanzhou, the post office will still accept and send them as usual. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Feng Qin'zai's brief telegram to Yu Youren was sent at 8:20 am and received at 8:45 pm. The original text: "Respected telegram acknowledged. Have forwarded it to Weiru. I knew nothing about the Xi'an Incident beforehand. After the incident, communication was blocked, and the truth is unclear. I love and protect the Party and the country, and the defense of my troops is important. I will definitely not act rashly. I hope you will often enlighten me and use it as a guide. I send this telegram in reply." (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The 15th Regiment of the 8th Artillery Brigade stationed in Xuzhou was originally a Northeast artillery unit. After Zhang's rebellion, the regiment commander Shi Jiru disarmed to show his peaceful attitude. Currently, Shi still leads unarmed soldiers to be stationed in Xuzhou awaiting orders. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Australian Dundas, who once served as Zhang Xueliang's advisor and is also a close friend of Chairman Chiang, went to Xi'an by plane today. On the one hand, he intends to rescue Mr. Chiang from danger, and on the other hand, he intends to dissuade Zhang from taking such a heartless and mad action. At present, the rebels under Zhang Xueliang have taken the national leader and many other senior officials in Shaanxi as hostages. The central government believes that Dundas is loyal and trusted by the Chinese people, hoping that he can resolve the current crisis this time. It is said that Dundas took a train from Nanjing to Luoyang last night and received a long-distance telephone report from there this afternoon, saying that Dundas had departed from Luoyang at 10:30 this morning and flew to Xi'an. Because the rebel leader has agreed to Dundas landing in Xi'an, everyone hopes that Zhang Xueliang is prepared to negotiate. People here are eagerly awaiting Dundas's report after arriving in Xi'an because they can use it to understand the true course of the Xi'an Incident. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the central government army and the rebels under Zhang Xueliang had a fierce battle in Xianyang, which is fifteen miles northwest of Xi'an. According to news brought back by central government planes, the city is guarded by troops loyal to the government, and they are resisting the larger number of rebels. A telegram from Zhang Xueliang received here says that Qian Dajun, Director of the First Adjutant Room of Mr. Chiang's headquarters, has died. Although Zhang's telegram stated that Mr. Qian's death was due to suicide, officials here believe that Qian was killed on Saturday morning when the rebels attacked Chiang's guards. It is said that Chiang's guards resisted bravely at the time. It is rumored that there was street fighting in Xi'an City when the incident occurred. Three regiments of the Central Army stationed in the city resisted the troops of Liu Duoquan's division under Zhang Xueliang for several hours. Although there was no resistance on the evening of that day, fighting continued the next morning. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tonight, news received here stated that the vanguard of the Central Army advanced along the Longhai Railway with little resistance from Zhang's army. Most of them allowed the Central Army to disarm without fighting. Few resisted. Feng Qin'zai, the division commander under Yang Hucheng, promised to be loyal to the Central Government. Today, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed that Qian Dajun had committed suicide. It is now known that Qian is still alive. Although Qian suffered a serious injury to his left arm, he apparently escaped to Xianyang. Tonight, rumors of a Xi'an uprising are circulating here, but because there is no official confirmation, the public does not believe it. The government is now in constant communication with loyal troops in Shaanxi. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng has also joined the rebellion. Lanzhou is now peaceful. Yu Xuezhong and his troops stationed in Gansu Province are loyal to the Central Government. Xi'an is only surrounded by one division of Zhang Xueliang's troops. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan Xishan told reporters today that he had telegraphed He Yingqin yesterday, agreeing to adopt various methods immediately to restore Mr. Chiang's freedom. He also said that the first report he received about the Xi'an Incident came from Nanjing, and he immediately convened meetings with his subordinates several times, all advocating that the first effort should be to rescue Mr. Chiang from danger. It is said that in addition to Jiang Zuobin, Jiang Dingwen, and Chen Jicheng, Yu Xuezhong of Zhang Xueshi's troops was also detained with Mr. Chiang because he strongly opposed this rebellion. As for the previous rumors that Chen Cheng, the Chief of the Military and Political Department, was detained, it is widely rumored here that he had left Shaanxi before the incident, but this statement cannot be confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Northeast Compatriots Discuss Rescuing Mr. Chiang</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Northeast compatriots gathered at Wu Yuanlian's residence on the 14th. Many veteran politicians and prominent figures attended. They resolved to: (1) issue a circular telegram to all Northeast compatriots in the country, calling on them to rise up and rescue Chiang; (2) telegraph Zhang Xueliang, urging him to rein in his actions and prioritize the national interest and the leader, and quickly send Chiang out of danger; (3) send respected compatriots to Shaanxi to lobby for rescue. The telegram was signed by 27 people, including Wang Shuhan, Liu Shangqing, Zhang Xiang, and Zhang Guochen. Wang Shuhan and Mo Dehui received invitations from Kong and He of the Central Government late at night on the 13th to discuss emergency rescue measures. Wang Shuhan took a China Aviation plane to Beijing on the afternoon of the 14th. Mo Dehui changed his flight to the morning of the 15th because he was attending a meeting of Northeast compatriots in Peiping on the 14th. The Northeast compatriots in Peiping also convened a meeting to respond, and various parties sent circular telegrams urging Northeast compatriots to quickly rise up and rescue Chiang. A certain Northeast figure said that the scattered compatriots in Peiping and Tianjin unanimously condemned Zhang's actions this time. If the rumor that Chiang has escaped danger is true, it is a lucky stroke of fate; otherwise, they should do everything possible to prevent Zhang from taking improper actions. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The Disarming of Zhang's Troops Stationed in Luoyang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The disarming of Zhang Xueliang's artillery brigade stationed in Luoyang: At 10:00 am on the 12th, Zhu Shaozhou, the Luoyang Garrison Commander, was on the phone with Qian Dajun in Xi'an because of something, but the call was suddenly interrupted, which made him very suspicious. At the same time, he learned that telegrams and telephones west of Tongguan were all out of service, and he knew that something had happened. He urgently telegraphed Minister He. At 11:00 am, Huang Yong'an, the brigade commander of Zhang Xueliang's artillery brigade stationed in Luoyang, received a secret telegram from Zhang, ordering him to rebel and occupy the airport, arsenal, and Central Bank. At that time, Zhu's troops had already been dispatched to guard. Zhu learned that Zhang had sent a telegram to Huang. Because Zhu and Huang had a very close personal relationship, he urgently called Huang to inquire. Huang immediately held the telegram to see Zhu. Zhu held a gun and asked Huang what his intentions were. Huang replied that he would definitely not listen to the rebellious order. Zhu was overjoyed and said that if you contribute to the Party and the country, the Party and the country will definitely not fail you. Zhu immediately led his own troops to surround the artillery brigade and the machine gun battalion and disarmed them all. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rumors of Mr. Chiang's Escape in Peiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain source, known to be reliable, claimed to have received news of an uprising in Xi'an. It is said that Mr. Chiang has regained his freedom and is currently on his way back to Nanjing, while Zhang Xueliang has been detained. It is extremely difficult to confirm this news at present, so it must be taken with a grain of salt. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) People are concerned about Mr. Chiang's safety. News came out of the Tianjin U.S. military camp in the evening that Mr. Chiang had escaped danger and flown to Luoyang, and that Zhang Xueliang had been killed by his subordinates, but it was difficult to verify. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News received here tonight stated that Yang Hucheng led an uprising in Xi'an, and Mr. Chiang has escaped danger. It is said that Yang initially agreed with Zhang Xueliang, but later persuaded Zhang to hand over Chiang to him to be kept in the inner city of Xi'an. After Yang obtained Chiang, he immediately revolted and commanded his troops to fight Zhang's army. Yang's army has a total of two divisions, and Zhang's army has a total of three divisions. This news has not yet been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng's report at the Central Memorial Week on the 14th, was as follows: Fellow comrades, today is the third day since the Xi'an Incident occurred and our one and only supreme leader, Mr. Chiang, encountered misfortune. Comrades, you must feel great grief and resentment about this incident. Mr. Chiang's misfortune is a great misfortune for the nation, and the severity of his situation is greater than that of the Premier's misfortune at Guanyin Mountain eleven years ago. This is something everyone can understand. Since the Premier's misfortune at Guanyin Mountain, the Premier's fearless spirit has been demonstrated to the people of the country. Not only did it increase the excitement of a group of comrades, but at that time, even the general public, even those who usually opposed and ridiculed the Kuomintang, spontaneously developed a sense of admiration, recognizing the courage and spirit of the Kuomintang, which was truly extraordinary and unimaginable to ordinary people. In recent years, the national crisis has deepened day by day. Thanks to the efforts of our comrades, with their courage and spirit of the past, and especially with Mr. Chiang's meticulous planning and leadership, the unification of the country has been completed. Comrades deeply believe that from now on, under the leadership of Mr. Chiang, we will be able to solve the national crisis and revitalize the nation in the near future. Who knew that out of the blue, Mr. Chiang suddenly encountered misfortune in Xi'an. In this extraordinary incident, we must understand that grief, anger, and anxiety will not solve Mr. Chiang's problem. Everyone should unite even more, display the inherent courage and spirit, and quickly seek to quell the incident. Only in this way can we live up to the Premier who created the Party with great difficulty, and to Mr. Chiang, our only leader, who painstakingly planned and led our comrades to complete unification. As for the details of Mr. Chiang's misfortune, there has been no special news as of this morning. I received this news relatively late, around 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th. After hearing about it, I was very surprised and visited various comrades to discuss it. According to the Railway Bureau's report, at 9:00 AM on the 12th, soldiers went to the Lintong Station and told the stationmaster, "The train must listen to his instructions and cannot be driven arbitrarily." It wasn't until 9:00 PM that we received a telegram about the Xi'an mutiny, stating that Liu Duoquan, the commander of the 105th Division, led his troops in a rebellion in Xi'an. However, it was impossible to confirm exactly where the rebel soldiers were. On the morning of the 13th, planes were dispatched to investigate. According to the report, it was in the Huaqing Pool area south of Lintong. At that time, a plane went down and was surrounded by rebel soldiers. It is said that Mr. Chiang was staying at Huaqing Pool on the evening of the 12th. Zhang Xueliang's treasonous telegram was received by the Ministry of Military Affairs at 6:00 or 7:00 PM on the 12th. There were also two other telegrams, one to Mr. Kong and one to Madam Chiang. His treasonous telegram does not seem to be doing the work of resisting the enemy. The first is to reorganize the National Government, and the second is to unite various parties and factions. This is very clear. His purpose is, first, to overthrow the National Government, and second, to overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang. And the listing of names in this telegram is extremely distorted and slanderous, even including generals who have always absolutely supported the Central Government and obeyed the leader, even Qian Dajun, the director of the Chairman's office. No one would believe that these people would follow Zhang Xueliang in rebelling. Therefore, this kind of despicable, clumsy, and childish method can only deceive oneself and not others. Zhang is the son of a frivolous aristocrat. He previously committed the crime of losing territory. Now, instead of expiating his crimes through meritorious service, he is committing this act of treason and rebellion. For the sake of our Party, our country, our nation, and for the sake of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor, we must follow the Central Government's decision and severely punish him. To ensure the safe return of our leader, Mr. Chiang, we must quickly quell the incident. Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, provincial chairmen and local generals have sent telegrams to the Central Government, expressing their deep hatred for Zhang Xueliang's rebellious behavior and expressing their sincere support for the Central Government. It can be seen that all responsible officials and generals throughout the country, except for Zhang Xueliang, can clearly see the interests of the country. Under the command of the Central Government, we seek the revival of the nation. At this time of extraordinary incident, everyone must cherish the inherent love, unity, and sincerity, strengthen solidarity, display the Kuomintang's great courage and spirit, and eliminate the rebellion. We must increase our courage in the face of danger and difficulty, not looking left or right. I believe that the chaos can be quelled soon, and the leader will be able to return soon. Comrades of the Party, do not hesitate, unite and strive forward! (Applause) Then, Committee Member Feng gave a speech, saying, "I just heard Mr. Ju's speech, and I think it is very right. I knew long ago that Zhang Xueliang was too young and easily susceptible to inducement and threats. Now he has so foolishly done this kind of treasonous thing. At this time, we must seize the crucial time and quickly rescue our supreme leader. Local officials and generals were very distressed after hearing about this incident and sent telegrams expressing their sincere support for the Central Government. With this phenomenon, we can believe that our country and our Party will not be shaken by this incident, and our supreme leader will be able to return safely in the shortest time. I hope that all comrades will remain calm, make up your minds, and firmly believe that only the Chinese Kuomintang and only the Premier's Three Principles of the People can save our Republic of China and revitalize our Chinese nation. Everyone must work hard with one heart and one mind!" (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin's report on the Xi'an Incident at the National Government Memorial Week: This Xi'an mutiny came suddenly, and people throughout the country, regardless of gender, age, or child, all sighed and hated it, because the national political structure, after the unanimous efforts of all parties, had already reached a unified and powerful situation. The remaining Red bandits were also just cowering in remote and desolate places, and could be eliminated soon. The harassment of the Suiyuan bandits and puppets had also been repelled repeatedly. The great cause of national revival had already seen the dawn. The national consciousness of the people throughout the country, especially in the past one or two years, has been vigorous and vigorous. Under this environment, if civil and military officials can obey the government's orders, move in an orderly manner, and proceed in unison, then in a few years, political construction can be on the right track, and the national humiliations of the past can be redressed one by one. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang was misled by heretical theories, acted arbitrarily, and even fundamentally violated the Central Government's assigned mission to suppress the bandits, colluding with the rebellious bandits, holding the superiors hostage, prolonging the lives of the remaining bandits, delaying the Central Government's major plans, harming the locality, and poisoning the people. Although from a military perspective, it is not difficult to use the Central Government's strong military force to quell the rebellion in one fell swoop, and it will not cause any major impact, the more the national army is consumed, the more the national strength for external self-defense is lost. Moreover, the military's duty to obey will inevitably be corrupted, and international credibility will inevitably suffer a blow. If this continues stubbornly, the entire country will suffer irreparable losses in spirit. How lamentable. Zhang Xueliang's touted slogans, according to reports, are so-called "accommodating the Communists and resisting the enemy." This is really naive and ridiculous, because the goal of resisting the enemy is to seek survival, and the result of accommodating the Communists will inevitably lead to destruction. Therefore, resisting the enemy and accommodating the Communists together is fundamentally harmful and not beneficial, and cannot achieve the goal of saving the country and preserving its existence. Moreover, as far as Zhang Xueliang himself is concerned, he did not resist the war at the time of the September 18th Incident, but wants to resist the war five years after the loss of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. He does not resist the war between the white mountains and black waters, but wants to resist the war in a place far away from the enemy. He does not resist the war under the guidance of the Central Government, but wants to resist the war after rebelling against the Central Government. Even a three-foot-tall child should know that his ambition is to seek glory and is difficult to put into practice. Furthermore, judging from the Central Government's kindness and righteousness towards Zhang Xueliang and his troops, it can be described as high as the sky and thick as the earth. The loss of the four provinces was not punished. It was originally hoped that he would be moved to repay the country and atone for his sins. It was never expected that he would be so despicable and repay kindness with ingratitude, acting recklessly and wantonly. Since ancient times, loyalty and courage to serve the country has always been the morality that men should have. Zhang Xueliang and his troops' love for their homeland, their longing for their ancestors' tombs, and their determination to avenge their shame are in line with human nature and heavenly principles. However, if they do not obey the orders of their superiors, do not listen to the government's commands, and do not act in unison, but want to collude with the remaining bandits that the government has been suppressing for many years, and act arbitrarily, I am afraid that loving the country will lead to misleading the country. The goal of resisting the enemy has not been achieved, but the disaster of the Communist bandits' prairie fire has reappeared in the Northwest. Zhang Xueliang is definitely not so foolish, and his subordinates must not be so ignorant as to fail to see this. One must know that a moment of impulse can lead to a serious mistake, to the point of ruining one's life and reputation. The Central Government has always advocated leniency and hopes that he can have a great awakening and change his ways. The government's suppression of bandits and resistance to foreign insults are all carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the Central Committee. The highest-ranking officials in the government and military are only executors, and cannot make any changes to the major policies. Now, although President Chiang is temporarily trapped, those who follow the Central Government's policies will inevitably continue to carry them out to the end, and there will be no changes due to President Chiang's temporary inability to perform his duties, and even less will there be any wavering due to President Chiang's being held hostage. Now, officials and people throughout the country fully support the policies of the Central Government, as can be clearly seen from the recent telegrams from important frontier officials and groups in various provinces. Anyone who violates the government's policies and acts in a bizarre way will surely be abandoned by the people of the world. His failure can be seen immediately. Reining in on the edge of the cliff, preserving the vitality of the country and nation, and preserving one's own reputation, is what is expected of Zhang Xueliang and his generals and soldiers. Furthermore, at this time of extraordinary incident in the country, all of us throughout the country, especially those in the government, should adopt a calm attitude. We should continue to do our daily affairs as usual, and we should intensify our efforts. Regarding Party, government, and military affairs, we should continue to move forward in full accordance with the established policies of the Central Government. Regarding local security, we hope that local officials will pay more attention to maintaining it and strive for stability. In short, at this time when the incident is serious, calmness is essential. It is important not to panic and disturb yourself, and not to listen to rumors. I believe that as long as we can stand firm, respond calmly, obey our superiors more, and abide by orders, it will not be difficult to completely resolve this incident in a short period of time. Let us encourage each other! (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun reported at the municipal government memorial week on the 14th, saying that Zhang Xueliang, as a senior frontier official, dared to hold the commander-in-chief hostage and fight against his superiors. This kind of traitorous rebel can be killed by everyone. Zhang's past crimes are well known. This time, he raised troops to rebel against the government. Judging from the past, we know that he will inevitably fail. We don't need to be anxious about Chairman Chiang's safety. Military and political leaders of various provinces have sent telegrams one after another, expressing their sincere support for the Central Government. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's escape is only a matter of time. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a memorial week on the morning of the 14th, chaired by Foreign Minister Zhang, and reported on the Xi'an rebellion. Listeners were all indignant. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Telegrams Zhang Xueliang to Advise Him to Quickly Return Chiang's Freedom; Song Summons Generals to Discuss in Peiping; Ma Xiangbo Also Telegrams Zhang to Advise Him</h3>
<p>(Peiping) All the generals of the Twenty-ninth Army have arrived here to discuss the situation of the Xi'an Incident with Song Zheyuan. Liu Ruming, Feng Zhian, and Zhang Zizhong also rushed to attend. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Song Zheyuan today, stating that Chairman Chiang is currently in Xi'an City and that he is responsible for guaranteeing his safety, so there is no need to worry. Song replied in a telegram, advising Zhang to think carefully about the situation caused by the incident and to quickly restore Chairman Chiang's freedom, and also stated that if Mr. Chiang is released first, all requests can be discussed at length. Chairman Lu Han Fuju has telegraphed He Yingqin, advocating for ways to rescue Chairman Chiang from danger, as the first step in resolving the Xi'an Incident. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Song Zheyuan on the morning of the 14th after the rebellion in Xi'an, reporting the incident and stating that Chairman Chiang is currently staying in Xi'an and is safe. Song immediately replied with a telegram advising him, hoping that Zhang would prioritize national affairs and heed the will of the people, and quickly escort the Commissioner back to Beijing, so that everything could be discussed at length, and urging him not to be taken advantage of by those who sow discord. At the same time, the original text was telegraphed to the Central Government for reporting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Xiangbo telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 14th, advising him: "Having read the newspaper and knowing that you are holding Mr. Chiang, I believe that if you want to avenge your father and the country, you must not harm the vitality of the country, otherwise you will be laughed at by the enemy as the Chu people killing Ziyu. I hope you will inform all parties of this idea, prioritizing the country, so that countries in the East and West will know the morality of the Chinese nation of enduring for the sake of the country. The old man is speaking for the country, not for personal gain. I think you will understand." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Telegrams from All Sides are Flying; Condemnation of Zhang Xueliang; Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, and Others Jointly Telegraph the Central Government, Requesting that He Yingqin Shoulder the Difficult Task</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, and other generals jointly issued a public telegram, saying, "We have just sent a telegram to the Central Government, stating that this time, Zhang's rebellion is reckless, betraying the Party and the country, without any shame or fear, and daring to coerce. It is intolerable to heaven and earth and resented by the people of the country. We beseech you to quickly make a plan, immediately issue an order to punish and attack, to uphold the law and save the country from danger. Regarding all national military affairs, we also beseech you to order Minister Jinggong to shoulder the difficult task and grant him full authority to facilitate command." At this time of national crisis, it is an opportunity for us soldiers to serve. Saving the Party and saving the country, we believe that we have the same feelings. We earnestly request unanimous advocacy and joint upholding of righteousness. With the utmost indignation, Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, Liu Zhenhua, Wei Lihuang, Sun Lianzhong, Pang Bingxun, Liu Maoen, Wan Yaohuang, Zhu Shaozhou, Huang Jie, Li Mo'an, Zhou Yan, Li Bifan, Huang Guanghua, Song Kentang, Lü Ji, Feng Anbang, Wu Tinglin, Chi Fengcheng, Liu Kan, Zheng Dongguo, Chen Tie, Li Tiejun, Wang Xiushen, Yan Xunfu, He Zhizhong, Bai Huizhang, Yang Qutong, Tang Junde, Xiang Chaozhong, Liang Hongen, Liu Bingcui, Wang Jinvi, Zhong Bin, Qian Lunti, Bao Gang, Zhang Zhan Kui, Huang Yong'an, Ruan Xun, Zheng Tingzhen, Zhang Huatang, and others kowtow." (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters and various groups of farmers, workers, businessmen, students, and women issued a public telegram on the 14th, saying, "To all provincial and municipal Party headquarters throughout the country, and forwarded to all agencies, groups, schools, and newspapers: This time, Zhang Xueliang led his troops in a rebellion and held the commander-in-chief hostage, acting arbitrarily. This kind of absurd behavior is an evil precedent unprecedented in Chinese and foreign history. Zhang Xueliang's crime of losing territory and harming the country in the September 18th Incident was already unforgivable. The Central Government was magnanimous and forgiving of his past, opening a path for him to start anew. Chairman Chiang even treated him with sincerity, hoping that he would atone for his sins through meritorious service. If Zhang Xueliang had any conscience, he should have been grateful and repaid the country. However, he harbored evil intentions, betrayed the Party and the country, and followed Chen Jiongming's old tricks, causing the leader to suffer misfortune. He has completely lost his rationality and cut himself off from humanity. In recent years, the country has been beset by internal and external troubles. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang led the country in arduous struggle and completed peaceful unification, allowing the country to enter a bright realm. Zhang Xueliang was exploited by the Red bandits and reactionaries, raising troops to incite chaos, disregarding national disasters and family feuds, recognizing thieves as his father, and advocating for the enemy, in an attempt to overthrow the Republic of China and plunge the country into an irrecoverable abyss. He is truly a sinner against the nation and the country. After the occurrence of this incident, the Central Government immediately issued an order to severely punish him. The established national policy of suppressing bandits and resisting foreign insults will adhere to a consistent approach. While calmly preparing, we seek the survival and way out for the entire Chinese nation, and we will not be intimidated by Zhang Xueliang's blackmail. At this time, if Zhang Xueliang can rein in on the edge of the cliff, repent, escort the leader back to Beijing, and await punishment, the people of the country may still give him a final opportunity to start anew. If he still stubbornly refuses to come to his senses and persists in his own way, he will not only be intolerable by Party discipline and national law, but also be the public enemy of the entire Party and the entire country. Comrades and compatriots throughout the country should immediately rise up and condemn him, and request that the Central Government severely punish him, so that those who betray the Party and the country will be duly punished, and the national discipline will be upheld. This telegram is urgent. We hope for unanimous advocacy. The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang and the groups of farmers, workers, businessmen, students, and women kowtow." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang's rebellious and insubordinate actions in Xi'an have caused anger and indignation among the people of the country. Over one hundred and seventy young generals throughout the country, including Hu Zongnan, Huang Jie, Li Mo'an, Sun Yuanliang, and He Zhonghan, jointly issued a public telegram, stating that Zhang's betrayal of the Party and the country is evident and requesting that the Central Government issue an order to suppress him in order to prompt Zhang's final awakening. It was also presented to Minister He. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Full text of the public telegram (omitted titles): "It is recognized that Zhang Xueliang, at a time when the country has been unified and society is becoming stable, dared to raise troops to cause chaos and coerce the leader. At the same time, he arbitrarily issued a public telegram, spreading his absurd claims of colluding with the Red bandits to overthrow the government. His crime of betraying the Party and the country is already evident. The Central Government has now resolved to deprive Zhang of all his positions and hand him over to the Military Commission for strict handling. We believe that for this traitor who destroys Party discipline and national law, the government should immediately issue an order to suppress him, in order to prompt Zhang Xueliang to rein in on the edge of the cliff, escort the leader to the south, and immediately release the soldiers, binding himself and awaiting punishment at the national gate. If he still stubbornly refuses to come to his senses and continues to rebel, we vow to don armor and wield weapons, unite and await orders, use Zhang to attack and uphold discipline.

<p>Presented to Minister He: "Minister, upon hearing the news of Zhang Xueliang's rebellious actions, causing the commander-in-chief to be unable to perform his duties, the masses were filled with anger and vowed to have nothing to do with Zhang. Now that the Central Government has resolved that all national troops will be under your command and control, we vow to wholeheartedly support and obey your orders. We also earnestly request that the government follow the Central Government's resolution to hand Zhang over to the Military Commission for strict handling and immediately issue an order to suppress him, in order to uphold the law and consolidate the central government. With utmost urgency, we await your orders." (Signatures are the same as in the public telegram, omitted) (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Issues Statement: Zhang Xueliang Should Redeem Himself and Strive for National Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Our correspondent reports on the 14th regarding the Xi'an Incident: A special visit was made to Vice Chairman Feng of the Military Affairs Commission, who kindly issued the following statement: China's most important issue at present is achieving national freedom and rejuvenation. To achieve this goal, it depends on the sincere unity of the entire nation, gathering all the nation's material resources, financial resources, human resources, and intelligence to defend the country and recover sovereignty. In recent years, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the government and the people have strived together, and significant progress has been made in military and diplomatic affairs. The continuous victories of the Suiyuan National Army recently are both a sacred manifestation of the nation's military and civilians' patriotism and the result of unified command and joint efforts. At a time when foreign troubles have not yet ended, and the recovery of lost territory has only just begun, correct strategies and unified guidance are required. Therefore, protecting the safety of the highest military and political leader is the greatest responsibility of the nation's military and civilians. Zhang Xueliang's actions this time, regardless of his political views, are clearly illegal and violate discipline. Zhang Xueliang has often declared his intention to avenge his father and wipe out national humiliation, but even in this regard, it must be done under centralized and unified leadership to be effective. Otherwise, the country will not be a country, and the father's revenge and national humiliation will never be redressed. Therefore, the current government's clear order of dismissal is to promote Zhang Xueliang's awakening, prompting him to escort Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing immediately and, under Chiang Kai-shek's unified leadership, redeem himself and sacrifice himself to avenge his father and wipe out national humiliation. Otherwise, such ungrateful actions will inevitably lead to his own ruin and disgrace. At a time when the country has suddenly suffered such an unfortunate event, the people of the whole country and officials at all levels are naturally extremely angry and anxious, worried about the aggravation of foreign troubles and pained by the imminent danger of fratricide. They are also worried about the safety of the highest leader. Therefore, they must strive calmly, fulfill their duties, and work hard to protect the leader and defend the country.

According to a semi-official announcement, the meeting decided as follows: Regarding Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, the Japanese government must not only wait for accurate information, but also should not take any action that exploits the chaos in China for Japan's own purposes or easily leads to misunderstandings, because Japan's responsibility is to be a stabilizing factor in East Asia. Therefore, Japan should currently adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the development of the situation and avoid taking active actions. The semi-official announcement also stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has obtained the full understanding of the Army and Navy regarding the above policy. (Central Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the seriousness of the Xi'an Incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened an emergency meeting at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 13th. After four hours of discussion, it was decided that the Japanese government's policy should be to observe the development of the situation with a fair and cautious attitude. The meeting ended at 10 PM. Foreign Minister Arita is scheduled to report to Prime Minister Hirota on the 14th and convene a meeting of the Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministers within days to further coordinate and then submit it to the Cabinet for a formal decision on the 15th.

<h3>Britain and France Mediate the Spanish Civil War; Germany, Italy, and Portugal's Replies are Unclear; They Hope Other Countries Can Provide Supplementary Explanations; Spanish Rebels Oppose Mediation</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the proposal by the British and French governments to mediate the Spanish Civil War, the replies from Germany and Portugal were delivered to the British Foreign Office yesterday. After reviewing them, the Foreign Office believes that the content is still unclear and hopes that the governments of those countries can provide supplementary explanations. It is learned that the German government plans to issue a statement today to clearly explain its intentions, and it is hoped that the Portuguese government will also clearly state its attitude. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the proposal by Britain and France to mediate the Spanish Civil War, the German government has sent a reply to the British and French ambassadors in Berlin, stating that Germany is prepared to support all plans to restore peace in Spain and prevent the war from spreading to other parts of Europe. If other governments can propose concrete mediation measures, Germany is prepared to cooperate and study them. However, the German government regrets that other governments have not effectively agreed to Germany's wish to prevent the influx of volunteer soldiers into Spain. Germany believes that stopping direct and indirect interference must be dealt with as one issue. As for the German government's recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government, it is because it considers that no other elements in Spain can help its people to govern themselves due to the barbarous actions on the other side of the conflict. Therefore, it is difficult for Germany to reach any understanding with the Spanish government. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British and French governments recently sent notes to the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, suggesting that they jointly find ways to mediate the Spanish Civil War. The German government yesterday sent separate notes to the British and French governments in response. It is learned that the content of the German note is divided into the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Germany is prepared to support all measures aimed at preventing the continued expansion of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>(2) On August 27, the German government advised all countries to include the prohibition of volunteer soldiers going to Spain in the non-intervention measures. Unfortunately, other governments did not make a decision on this, which made the Spanish situation more serious. The German government now believes that measures to prohibit any direct or indirect interference in the Spanish Civil War should be discussed as a whole.</p>
<p>(3) Germany expresses sympathy for the cooperation of various countries in mediating the Spanish Civil War. However, at the same time, the German government has something to declare: the German government has previously recognized the Nationalist authorities as the legitimate government of Spain. This action expresses Germany's opinion that the government of Burgos is the only factor representing the Spanish people. Whether it is helpful to seek reconciliation with the opposition is questionable, because the opposition to the Nationalist government is now controlled by anarchists. Under these circumstances, the German government does not see the possibility of organizing a referendum for the Spanish people in accordance with normal procedures. However, if other governments can propose practical and concrete suggestions for mediating the civil war, the German government is still willing to consider its implementation. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the proposal by the British and French governments to mediate the Spanish Civil War, the Italian government's reply was delivered to Britain yesterday. Its content is divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) The Italian government shares the same feeling with the British and French governments, who both want to prevent the expansion of the Spanish civil unrest and hope that Spain will restore order.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issuance of a formal declaration, reiterating the various non-intervention measures and enriching them, the Italian government proposed at the beginning of the outbreak of the two countries' civil war that if the non-intervention policy is to be effective, then the recruitment of volunteer soldiers, the solicitation of subsidies, and various propaganda methods should all be prohibited. It is firmly believed that if this proposal had been implemented at that time, it would have been easier than now. Although the Italian government is still willing to join the United Kingdom in studying various measures to enrich the non-intervention agreement and strictly implement the monitoring system, it is "on the condition that all these measures are accepted."</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the proposal by the British and French governments to mediate the Spanish Civil War and order the people of that country to hold a referendum to determine the political system, Italy is also willing to accept it, but "the Italian government has doubts as to whether a referendum can be implemented in Spain under the current situation." Furthermore, from an objective point of view, "the Spanish Nationalist government has successively gained the support of the majority of the people and possesses a large part of the country's territory. The will of the Spanish people has already been expressed because of this, and it is undeniable." On the contrary, the Valencia government in that country has anarchistic tendencies, and its brutal acts are countless. "Therefore, reconciliation is extremely difficult. However, the Italian government is still willing to do its best to work for peace. If the governments of various countries believe that it is necessary to put forward various suggestions, Italy is naturally prepared to consider them in a spirit of friendly cooperation." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to people from the Portuguese delegation to the League of Nations, the Portuguese government's reply to the proposal by Britain and France to mediate the Spanish Civil War expresses acceptance of the principle of implementing non-intervention measures. However, it does not recognize the possibility of mediation under the current circumstances. Portugal can only consider the practical methods of implementing mediation if both parties in the Spanish Civil War first accept mediation. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Salamanca: A key figure in the Nationalist government recently commented on the proposal by the British and French governments to mediate the civil war, saying, "The struggle waged by the Nationalist army has no room for reconciliation. If we want to end the struggle, it will be either our army winning or the Red Army surrendering. There is no other way. Those who propose mediation have not taken into account the true situation in Spain, and they are also ignorant of the root of the Spanish incident. In fact, the two concepts of religion and patriotism dominate the Spanish Civil War and do not allow for any concessions. Some say that the Spanish Civil War may affect the current situation in Europe. This statement is not without reason, but our goal is to rebuild a Catholic and imperial Spain, so we should not make any compromises." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Committee Discusses Amendment of the Covenant; Chilean Representative and Spanish Foreign Minister Negotiate the Issue of Relieving Women, Children, the Elderly, and the Weak</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee on the Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations, namely the Committee of Twenty-Eight, is scheduled to hold its first resolution meeting at 3:30 PM today in order to elect the Presidium and formulate the work program. It is generally believed that the Belgian representative, Mr. Bourquin, will come forward to serve as chairman. The work of the committee may have to be extended until the end of this week before it can be concluded. The French Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, former French Foreign Minister Mr. Peng Gu, arrived here at 9:40 AM today to participate in the meeting. Although Italy is one of the member states of the committee, it did not send personnel to attend. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the Spanish Civil War issue, the Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, the Chilean Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Edward, has agreed with the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Talier, to move a part of the Spanish refugees, especially women, children, the elderly, and the weak, housed in the Chilean Embassy in Madrid to a completely neutral area. After the temporary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations closes, Mr. Edward will continue the talks through diplomatic channels. He is scheduled to return to his post in London tomorrow evening. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Regarding the issue of the Turkish ethnic minorities in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, the Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to discuss it this afternoon. The French and Turkish delegations were preparing separately this morning. According to the scheduled procedure, the Council will hold a closed meeting at 5 PM this afternoon, and then hold an open meeting, where Turkish Foreign Minister Mr. Rüştü will deliver a speech to explain his country's views. The French representative, French Foreign Minister Mr. Weygand, may submit a reply tomorrow morning. Mr. Weygand met this morning with British Undersecretary of State Lord Cranborne, Soviet Ambassador to France Mr. Potemkin, and Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, the Chilean Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Edward. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is generally believed that Turkey will demand that each of these cities enjoy autonomy and be governed by the League of Nations, so that they are in the same position as the Free City of Danzig. At that time, the Council will appoint a rapporteur to study this issue and submit a report at the regular meeting of the Council in January next year. From now until then, the Council will take several measures as a transition. It is generally believed that France and Turkey have always had strong diplomatic relations and want to maintain them. There will naturally be no difficulties when the Council discusses this case today. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Angora: The Turkish Prime Minister declared today that the Turkish government will demand independence for the ethnic minorities in Alexandretta. He also said that until a suitable solution is found, Turkey is determined to take the necessary steps to achieve autonomy in the area. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Madrid is Heavily Defended; French Newspaper Reporter Dies in a Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Madrid: No battles took place in the vicinity of the city today. In addition, the weather was sunny, and many members of the militia took the opportunity to stroll around the city and take a break. There are often photographers on the streets taking pictures of militia and syndicalist figures. These people all take brave poses in front of the camera, holding weapons and pretending to shoot at invisible enemies, while young people watch from the side, laughing loudly. Until 4 PM, several cannon sounds were heard, and two shells fell near the telephone bureau, fortunately without injuring anyone. Mr. Trapol, a reporter for the French Paris Evening News, was shot by Nationalist planes while flying in the city of Pastrana (about 100 kilometers from Madrid) a few days ago, and eventually died of serious injuries. His remains have recently been transported from here to the port of Valencia in the southeast, and then transferred to France for burial. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Five government bombers and five fighter planes attacked the Vitoria airfield today, destroying it and shooting down two rebel bombers. One government plane also crashed. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Talavanara: Special report from our correspondent: The government forces are heavily defended in the university district and the old royal palace area in the western suburbs of Madrid. Every night, at the sound of anything suspicious, they attack the Nationalist forces. The Moroccan guest army and regular army under their command do not return fire. The government forces have also placed strong barbed wire in front of the first trench on Rosales Avenue in the northwest suburbs, and used "chevaux de frise" to protect the forward patrols. On the northern side of the Dedune district, the government forces have built new fortifications with reinforced concrete. As for the southern side, the government forces' outpost seems to have retreated slightly. Observing the situation on the front lines of various countries, the government forces now seem to be preparing to resist the Nationalist forces' attack. The artillery teams of both sides did not move today, and only a few fighter planes flew in the air without dropping bombs. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Political Strife Resurfaces in Barcelona; Socialist Party Demands Reorganization of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Barcelona: Political strife has recently occurred within the Executive Yuan of the Catalonia Autonomous Region, and there is talk of reorganizing the Executive Yuan. A key figure in the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, Congressman Komo Lera, who once held an important position in the Executive Yuan, has issued a statement explaining the political strife, which is worthy of attention. He said: Since Germany and Italy recognized the Franco government, the political situation has changed. The Unified Socialist Party to which I belong was the first to raise this issue, because the current power of the autonomous region government to plan the war and resist the rebels is not sufficient. Therefore, our party proposes to reorganize the Executive Yuan of the autonomous region government into a government with full powers, so that the National Confederation of Labor (CNT) belonging to the anarchist faction, the General Union of Workers (UGT) belonging to the socialist faction, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), the Metalworkers' Union, etc., can all participate, and the Intelligence Committee and the National Defense Department should be abolished, because all members of the Executive Yuan have full power to select and replace their colleagues. The reorganized Executive Yuan should devote all its efforts to directing the war, and the issue of the future social organization should be temporarily shelved. Komo Lera also confirmed the claim that the Unified Socialist Party demanded that the Marxist-Leninist Workers' Party (POUM) withdraw from the Executive Yuan, saying that the POUM attacked several decisions of the Executive Yuan, especially its criticism of the Soviet Union, so it could no longer be allowed to participate in the government. Finally, he clearly condemned the various tendencies to separate Catalonia from Spain, saying that "international fascists are spreading rumors" to mislead people into believing that the separation movement is supported by the Third International, which is completely untrue. According to Komo Lera, who is known to be friendly with Soviet Consul Endonov in Catalonia, this statement shows that the Soviet government is frankly opposed to Catalonia's independence. In addition, the Marxist-Leninist Workers' Party (POUM) newspaper "Combat" opposed the proposal of the Unified Socialist Party to abolish the Intelligence Committee and the National Defense Department, saying that these two agencies are necessary for the working class to monitor internal order and military organization and should not be abolished. "Combat" also opposed the proposal of the Unified Socialist Party to temporarily shelve the social revolution during the war. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>France is Willing to Negotiate Economics with Germany with Military Reduction as a Condition</h3>
<p>(London) French Prime Minister Léon Blum told a Paris correspondent for the News Chronicle yesterday that "France is now prepared to assist Germany so that its economic situation can return to normal, but with the condition that it accept the standard of general disarmament and agree to assist Europe in putting the political situation back on track."

<p>(London) Naval negotiations between Britain and Turkey began this morning. The British representative is Sir Craige, Naval Advisor to the Foreign Office, and the Turkish representative is Ambassador Auchie to the UK. Both sides also brought naval experts to assist. In this regard, the Turkish side has made a request that the Anglo-Russian naval negotiations should be used as a blueprint. After Britain, France, and the United States established the new naval treaty in March of this year, Britain has conducted separate negotiations with Poland, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, asking them to sign on. In addition, Britain plans to have the same negotiations with Greece and Yugoslavia. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

It is now confirmed that they will meet with German leader Hitler tomorrow before returning to Hungary. Koczma made a statement in Berlin, stating that upon his return, he plans to establish labor service groups modeled after the German system. This announcement has been met with strong criticism from Hungarian opposition figures. Furthermore, regarding Hungary's relations with Romania and Yugoslavia, Germany advocates for improvement. Hungarian figures who want to amend treaties fear that their views will be threatened and are also unhappy about this. Additionally, a commercial agreement between Hungary and Yugoslavia is about to be signed. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Finance and Prices in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Yesterday, the disorder in the Shanghai commodity market and the sharp fluctuations in prices were a clear reflection of the extraordinary situation in the economic sphere. Government bonds are the most sensitive to the impact of the situation. Initially, there was a discussion about not opening the market at all. Once the market opened, all unified bonds fell by four yuan and reached the limit. This is an unprecedented phenomenon since the unified bonds were listed. Cotton yarn was even more peculiar. The current month's yarn opened down by more than five yuan, but immediately rebounded by twelve yuan in the second session. Cotton also rose by one yuan several jiao. Apart from the psychological effects of merchants, there is really not much reason for these rises and falls. What is most astonishing is that flour, wheat, grains, oil, and bean cakes are rising as if there is no end in sight. For example, flour prices for the January period and beyond are as high as four yuan and three jiao or more. Future wheat opened at seven yuan, one jiao and two fen, which is an unprecedented price in decades. Soybean oil is already at twenty-four yuan and four jiao per dan, and raw oil has also reached twenty-two yuan. If we recall last year's market conditions, just in terms of oil alone, our living expenses have more than doubled.</p>
<p>The margin of fluctuation has not changed much in the past year. Yesterday, due to speculative opportunities, there was a fluctuation of fourteen yuan in one day. The result was a rise of five yuan and four jiao. In addition, items such as metals and tung oil were suspended due to the unrest of the situation. In fact, extreme rises and falls are not right. Suspension of transactions is also unnecessary. Knowing that the situation is unstable, we should not alarm each other, thus adding to the factors of instability. Because if we want to achieve a favorable resolution to the current dangerous situation, we must also strive for economic stability.</p>
<p>The way to stabilize the economy is to first stabilize finance. In this extraordinary period, the people should no longer have any doubts about legal tender. The situation of everyone rushing to buy foreign exchange yesterday was very distressing. We should know that only by stabilizing finance can we extricate ourselves from the困境. Otherwise, pursuing individual interests will only lead to a harmful outcome for everyone. We believe that in this period, those who are fully responsible for finance should make thorough plans for finance. The general public, especially financial, industrial, and commercial circles, and the wealthy, should also absolutely trust the government's monetary policy for their own sake and for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>As for the soaring prices, which were so severe yesterday, it is clearly an abnormal state. If we do not seek to remedy the situation, the future is very worrying. We believe that those who are responsible for guiding industry and commerce should immediately come forward to correct unreasonable price increases. Sometimes, it may be necessary to stop them. Because passively restricting is the simplest way to maintain the market. Now that the closing period is approaching, if there is a change in the economic sphere, industry and commerce will inevitably suffer a major blow. We must take precautions before it happens.</p>
<h3>No Prospect of Fisheries Agreement Between Japan and the Soviet Union; Various Parties Criticize Arita's Diplomatic Policy; Hirota Cabinet May Resign Next Spring</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is extremely clear that there is no hope of signing a fisheries agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union before the end of this year, since the first meeting between Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Aoi and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Litvinov stated that the Soviet government does not believe that the purpose of the Japanese-German agreement is solely to oppose communism, because the geographical location of Japan and Germany clearly indicates the goals of the two countries. Therefore, the Soviet government does not want to answer before deciding on its new attitude. The Soviet Union's tough stance can be seen from Litvinov's statement. Arita instructed Shigemitsu yesterday to redouble his efforts to urge the Soviet Union to sign, but the general public fears that this effort will be ineffective. Japanese newspapers are criticizing the diplomatic policies of Hirota and Arita more and more intensely. It is rumored that various parties are preparing to impeach the cabinet. At the same time, the Privy Council is also seriously investigating the government's responsibility for the failure of diplomacy. It is now feared that Arita's resignation is unavoidable, and the period is probably in early spring next year. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the signing of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, when Ambassador Shigemitsu met with Litvinov on the 9th, the Soviet Union replied that the Soviet government is now considering measures to sign the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, and will notify the Japanese government after a decision is made. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is waiting for a reply from the Soviet Union with optimistic observations. However, from the Soviet Union's perspective, the obligations under the treaty not only include the obligation to sign the fisheries treaty, but also the impact it has suffered since the treaty was abolished is significantly greater than that of Japan. Therefore, from the following points of view, it seems impossible to foresee that the Soviet Union will refuse to sign.</p>
<p>Japan's fishing rights are long-standing vested interests that have existed for two years, and have even been confirmed based on the Sakhalin-Chishima Exchange Treaty and the Japan-Russia Basic Treaty. Moreover, according to Article 11 of the Japan-Russia Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union has an obligation to conclude an agreement with Japan. Therefore, since the Soviet Union recognizes the existence of international treaties, the Soviet Union must not refuse to sign the fisheries treaty.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Fisheries Treaty, the Soviet Union created a format for employing Japanese citizens in North Pacific fisheries in order to maintain its national dignity. If it is in a state of no treaty, it is obvious that Japanese citizens will forcibly fish in the North Pacific. Therefore, the dignity of the Soviet Union will be flawed.</p>
<p>The Fisheries Treaty restricts the freedom of Japanese North Pacific fisheries and allows the exercise of fishing rights with certain restrictions. Therefore, if Japan is free from this restriction and freely fishes, the Soviet Union will be greatly disadvantaged, and Japan's fishing rights will have virtually no impact. The Soviet Union is disturbed by national debate until early spring next year, and this is not difficult to predict. Judging from the objective situation above, the ending will certainly be signed soon. (Daimon dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Former King of England Arrives in Vienna; Stays in an 800-Year-Old Castle</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Former King Edward of England arrived today at Count Losos' 800-year-old castle, and immediately spoke with Mrs. Simpson by telephone for a long time. The former king's arrival in Austria this time is not comparable to a monarch's tour. He only brought one attendant and one dog. When he arrived in Vienna, only the British minister and some Austrian officials welcomed him. There was no lively scene of military music and troops around. (Guomin dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Duke of Windsor, the former King of England, arrived here last night from Innsbruck in western Austria by special train. He looked very healthy and immediately took a car to Enzesfeld, fifteen miles outside Vienna, as a guest of Baron Rothschild. Enzesfeld is a very large hunting ground, occupying fifteen square miles, with a giant manor built in the middle, with forty rooms. When the former king's special train approached the station last night, the police immediately posted sentries in front of and behind the sleeping car, not allowing anyone to approach. When the car arrived at the station, the only greeters were Sir Selby, the British Minister to Austria, and no representatives from the Austrian government were at the station. The former king wore a black coat with a leather collar and a black and red wool scarf. After entering the station, he went back to the VIP lounge and then suddenly retreated, inviting photographers to take pictures of him. The group then returned to the platform, and the former king happily allowed the photographers to take his portrait. He then boarded Baron Rothschild's car. His cavalry officer, Lieutenant Colonel Lief, relayed to everyone that he had not decided how long to stay in Austria, and expressed his gratitude to the reporters and photographers who came with him for not disturbing him during the journey. The former king brought a small hunting dog on this trip, and the public only saw him twice during this trip. The first time was when he went for a walk at the port of Boulogne in northwestern France, and the second time was when the train arrived in Innsbruck, and the former king admired the snowy scenery outside the window. The former king's whereabouts are kept secret. The police in England, France, Austria, and Switzerland have all provided strict protection. The French Detective Department once hung a carriage behind the special train. Every time it arrived at a station, the detectives were distributed on the platform where the former king's sleeping car was parked. It is said that there were police guarding every kilometer along the way. When the train arrived in Basel, Switzerland, the French and Swiss police changed defenses. When the train arrived at Buchs, a town on the Austrian-Swiss border, the Austrian and Swiss police also changed defenses. The reporters traveling with the special train almost lost track of the former king. Later, in order to comfort the reporters, the former king finally agreed to tell them his final destination. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) After staying in Enzesfeld for a few days, the former king will go to Kitzbühel for a short stay to engage in winter sports, and then visit Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the regent. He will then return to Vienna to consult with ear specialist Dr. Neumann. The special train taken by the former king was attached to the Paris-Vienna express train in Zurich, Switzerland, and headed to Austria. At noon, it arrived in Feldkirch, a city on the border between Switzerland and Austria. More than 50 reporters flocked to the train to find the former king, but the former king was dining in the carriage and did not go out, so they did not get to see him. Later, when the special train arrived in Innsbruck, a postal and telecommunications bureau official boarded the train and presented the former king with a telegram from England, asking the former king to speak to London on the long-distance telephone immediately. However, the former king only replied with a telegram. When the special train arrived in Kitzbühel, the former king received another telegram. According to some people, the telegram was sent by Mrs. Simpson, who had taken a train to meet him in Vienna. However, other people claimed to have seen Mrs. Simpson in the former king's carriage. After reading the second telegram, the former king ordered his entourage to inform the reporters traveling with him that his trip was of a private nature and asked them not to disturb him. What he wanted to say had been explained in detail in his radio broadcast last Friday, and there was nothing to add. Once he arrived in Vienna, he would allow the reporters to take pictures of him. The special train stopped in Kitzbühel for a longer time than usual, because the manager of the "Grand Hotel" had to board the train to greet him. The former king received him and told him that he would return to Kitzbühel soon. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that Parliament is willing to grant former King Edward a considerable retirement allowance. Members of Parliament believe that if the former king's financial situation is not very good, or if he places himself or the government and the royal family in an awkward situation, the people will always remember his eventful reign of eleven months. Therefore, the opinion of Parliament seems to be in favor of the government immediately allocating a retirement allowance of £50,000, and it is believed that although Edward did not fully satisfy the people after ascending the throne, he was the most outstanding Prince of Wales in British history when he was the heir apparent. At present, all parties seem to be doing their best to promote the idea of quickly forgetting the period when Edward was in power. The impression Edward gave people was very different from that of the late King George V. The new king's name, George VI, also has this intention. Newspapers today all praise the new king's sense of responsibility and his concern for the throne, and are full of praise for the new queen's demeanor. (Guomin dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Cannes It is said that Mrs. Simpson has purchased a farm near Tunis in North Africa. The village of La Rouveyre, where Mrs. Simpson lives, denied the rumor today. According to a Tunis newspaper this morning, Mrs. Simpson purchased a large farm overlooking the Bay of Hammamet, thirty miles outside Tunis. It is also rumored that Mrs. Simpson has departed from here to Austria, but Lord Brownlow, a friend of the former King of England, has solemnly stated to the press on behalf of Mrs. Simpson that Mrs. Simpson still intends to stay in the Riviera. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Cannes The number of reporters in front of the Villa Lou Vie has decreased. It is reported that Mrs. Simpson has been writing letters all day today and has not left the house. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France Mrs. Simpson requested protection from the French police after the Scottish detectives withdrew, and permission has been granted. (Guomin dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Church of England Regrets Former King's Abandonment of Public Duty for Personal Pleasure</h3>
<p>(London) The Archbishop of Canterbury, Lang Fu Shi, issued a sound recording speech today, expressing deep regret over the decision of former King Edward to abdicate, saying that Edward VIII should not abandon his high and sacred trust from God for personal pleasure. Although the motive for his abdication is very strong, he has lost high hope and abandoned a major trust, which is both shocking and sad. What is strange is that he does not seek his happiness in accordance with the Christian principles of marriage and the etiquette and customs of the nation. Those who support him should know that the people have their own public opinion. But how can we forget Edward's great ambitions and sincerity in his youth, and his efforts to help the poor and his efforts at home and abroad? We must not forget this, and we have to call out from the bottom of our hearts: "What a pity! What a pity!" (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday was Sunday. When the bishops preached in church, they mostly discussed the abdication of former King Edward, namely the Duke of Windsor. Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: "The British subjects believed in and loved the former king so much that they could not love him anymore. The former king actually abandoned his honor and abandoned his subjects, which is surprising and regrettable. The happiness that the former king seeks does not conform to the Christian marriage system, and his behavior is greatly different from the instincts of the British people and the models they adhere to. This is truly regrettable. The British people should take this as a lesson and not repeat this mistake." Bishop Bradford said, "We deeply regret the decision made by the former king, but what is more clear is that the former king had already made up his mind and never changed his original intention." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Industrial Requisition Plan; Secretary of War Says There Is No Intention to Prepare for War; It Is Also of the Same Nature as the Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that more than 20,000 factories across the United States have been investigated in detail by the Army and Navy General Staffs in order to draft a wartime factory mobilization plan. The investigation items include the factory's capital, the number of workers, the items produced, and the quantity produced. Secretary of War Woodring said today, "Now we know what is needed in wartime, and the location and time required for the production of all supplies." Woodring also solemnly declared that the industrial requisition plan drafted by him and Secretary of the Navy Swanson had no intention of preparing for war, but only wanted to enable the U.S. military to use domestic resources during wartime to obtain supplies in the most economical and effective way. This plan, even if implemented, is of the same nature as the Neutrality Law and will not take effect until after a declaration of war. However, once a declaration of war is made, the president will have full power to control all domestic finance, transportation, agriculture, industry, and mining. As for the content of the plan, it includes the following points: (1) Stipulate prices, wages, land prices, and rents. (2) Control the manufacture and distribution of goods with a license system. (3) Strictly manage the nation's commodity, stock, and securities trading markets. (4) Prevent hoarding and speculation. (5) Requisition industrial management talents to serve the government. (6) Requisition all industries. (Guomin dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Qingdao Japanese Cotton Mills Resume Work; Seven-Tenths of Workers Arrive at the Mills; Authorities Send Personnel to Monitor Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) The Japanese cotton mills in Qingdao resumed work one after another on the morning of the 14th. The number of workers arriving at each mill accounted for a little more than seven-tenths. The remaining workers who left Qingdao will gradually return to Qingdao within days. Starting on the 14th, the Public Security Bureau specially dispatched a large number of police and security teams to guard the vicinity of the mills to prevent disorder. The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to each mill to monitor the resumption of work. Regarding the withdrawal of the Japanese Marines, the Japanese side stated that they would handle the agreement of resuming work and withdrawing troops on one side. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Nine Japanese cotton mills that had been on strike have all resumed work this morning. It is expected that all work will be completed within one or two days, so the labor unrest can be said to have subsided. The rumor that the landed Japanese naval marines will withdraw today has not been verified. The Chinese semi-official side believes that they will not withdraw within three or four days. However, the overall situation here is completely peaceful. This morning, a Chinese shop owner entered the sentry line set up outside the wharf where a Japanese cruiser was moored and was stabbed by a Japanese sentry with a bayonet. The Chinese authorities have protested to the Japanese Consul General. This case should be resolved peacefully. The person did not understand Japanese and accidentally entered the sentry line. After being stabbed by the Japanese soldier, he fled in a hurry. The Japanese soldier chased after him and stabbed him again, causing serious injuries. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>The Momentum of the Puppet Troops in Northern Chahar Has Faded Away, While the Bandit Troops in Jehol Have Become More Active. The Majority of the Bandit Troops are Concentrating in Guyuan and Advancing Westward Step by Step. A Certain Party is Transporting Large Quantities of Military Supplies to Aid the Puppet Troops in Jehol.</h3>
<p>Jia Temple Dispatch: The puppet bandit troops of Li Shou-hsin and Wang Ying in Northern Chahar, after their recent failed counterattacks on Bailingmiao, Northern Sui, and Wuchuan, have become increasingly disorganized. After the successive defections of Jin Xianzhang and Shi Yushan from Wang's troops, they have already disintegrated. The remaining troops of Li Shou-hsin are also dwindling. On October 10, a certain special agency here, after discovering that Wang Ying himself was indeed in contact with the Sui army to express his allegiance, was extremely angry. It immediately notified all special agencies in Northern Chahar to offer a large reward for Wang Ying's capture. The reason is that Wang Ying has been active in foreign affairs since the autumn of this year, for more than four months, and has spent more than one million yuan in military expenses. This decisive battle was launched, and new-style weapons were exchanged with his troops. Now, nothing has been achieved, and his troops have turned over all their sharp weapons to the Sui army. Therefore, they hate him to the bone. If he is captured, he will follow in the footsteps of Dao Yi, which is Wang Ying's fate. Few people know the whereabouts of Wang himself. As for the current situation in Northern Chahar, I will briefly describe what I have seen and heard as follows:</p>
<p>The Jehol Army: Suddenly Active</p>
<p>Since the puppet bandits in Northern Chahar suffered several defeats, their momentum has faded away. A certain party took this opportunity to order its regular troops and the bandit troops in Jehol to advance westward step by step, replacing the puppet bandits in their former positions. Therefore, the Jehol army has been actively deployed recently. Wang Jingshou's troops are responsible for the defense of the Duolun, Zhangbei, and Nanhouchang areas. Zhang Hai-peng is responsible for the defense of Guyuan, Kangbao Baochang, and Shangdu. Their regular troops are interspersed among them. The majority of the Jehol army is now concentrating in Zhanyuan, gradually advancing westward. Today (November 11), the head of a certain special agency declared to the bandits and puppets here that they will never be allowed to retreat another step. It has been decided to set up a forward supply station in Zhangbei, and the main supply station will still be located in Duolun. It is also heard that a certain party intends to dig trenches along the Great Wall, which is currently under planning, probably as a precaution when necessary.</p>
<p>Recent Deployment of the Jehol Army</p>
<p>The current deployment of the Jehol army is as follows: More than 1,000 artillerymen of Zhang Hai-peng's rebel army, carrying more than 30 steel cannons, arrived at the Li Jiayingzi in Baochang County on the evening of the 9th of this month. Eight hundred cavalrymen arrived at Yutiaogou. In Tuchenzi, which belongs to Kangbao County, there are also more than 800 infantrymen of the same troops and 300 regular troops of a certain party. More than 3,000 people have been concentrated between Shangdu and Jia Temple. There are also 2,000 troops in Pangjiang. Wang Jingshou's troops are advancing from Duolun to Houchang. About 1,000 regular troops of a certain party are stationed in Qitai and Batai west of Shangdu and Pangjiang. The security team they recruited is now stationed in Daolanhada and Shitai, west of Shangdu, after the failed counterattack on Bailingmiao. In addition, there are more than 3,000 Mongolian bandit troops stationed in the Hatuoha area west of Shangdu. The majority of Li Shou-hsin's rebels are now stationed in Shangdu. Li himself often travels between Jia Temple and Shangdu.</p>
<p>A Certain Party is Transporting Weapons to Help the Bandits</p>
<p>The weapons and ammunition used by the bandits and puppet troops in Northern Chahar are fully supplied by a certain party. The large shipment of ammunition transported from Tianjin the other day has been completely transported to Zhangbei, Jia Temple, Shangdu, and Nanhouchang. Most of the poison gas shells were transported to Nanhouchang to prepare for a second westward invasion and reconciliation, using aircraft and poison gas as the main weapons. The technical personnel who guide the release of poison gas arrived in Zhangbei on the evening of the 9th of this month, about a dozen people. The aircraft pilots arrived in Duolun from Chifeng on the 7th of this month, about thirty people. Today (November 11), they arrived in Zhangbei and transferred to the Nanhouchang Pass. The routes for a certain party to supply military supplies to the rebel troops are very convenient, one via the Ping-Sui Railway and the other via Jehol, greatly aiding the bandits.</p>
<h3>Han Fu-qu's Proclamation: Taking Safeguarding the Country and Protecting the People as His Mission - Those Who Create Rumors and Stir Up Trouble Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Han Fu-qu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander of the Shandong Security Force, in view of the recent unclear situation and the deepening national crisis, and for the sake of local security, has issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting the creation of rumors and incidents. The full text of the proclamation reads: "For the proclamation, recently the situation has been unstable, the national crisis is deepening, and those who like to cause trouble and rejoice in misfortune often make reckless speculations, causing disturbances and doubts, which are not conducive to local security. This Chairman and Commander has always taken safeguarding the country and protecting the people as his mission, and cannot but take precautions in advance. From now on, anyone who creates rumors and stirs up trouble sufficient to disturb the people's hearts will be dealt with by military law once discovered. In addition to ordering the military and police to investigate and arrest them at any time, this proclamation is issued for public knowledge. All people from all walks of life must strictly abide by it and not violate it. This proclamation is hereby issued, Han, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander of the Shandong Provincial Security Force." (13th)</p>
<h3>Recent Financial Situation in Guangdong Province: The Authorities are Actively Purchasing Silver from Various Subordinate Areas; The Conversion to the Silver Dollar Standard is Not Yet Possible in the Short Term; The Business Community Again Requests a Reduction in the Additional 5% Rate</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the authorities actively reorganized Guangdong's finances, considerable progress has been made in purchasing silver. Therefore, there has recently been an increase in the issuance of Guangdong mill notes to facilitate the purchase of silver. The reason why villagers in various subordinate areas are selling silver one after another is that the end of the year is approaching, the rural economy is difficult, and they have no choice but to exchange their daily savings for general mill notes to maintain the status quo. It is estimated that there are still about 10 million yuan worth of silver in various subordinate areas. Currently, the authorities are using mill notes to collect silver, so there is no talk of converting to the silver dollar standard yet. However, the ratio between the silver dollar (national currency) and mill notes has remained between an additional 5% (or an additional 4.9% and some change) for several days. Most merchants believe that this is ultimately not a blessing for the people of Guangdong, because Guangdong mill notes have considerable value and cannot be depreciated so much. People in the business community have repeatedly requested the authorities to change this ratio between silver dollars and Guangdong mill notes to avoid huge losses to merchants, but the financial authorities have not responded. The 5% ratio is determined by the central government based on various circumstances and is difficult to change rashly. Therefore, the Guangzhou Industrial Federation has recently submitted another request to reduce the rate. The petition is as follows: "We have found that Guangdong Province has always used mill dollars as the standard for paying national taxes. Before 1932, an additional 2% or 2.5% was added for water compensation. Before the recovery and in the early years of the Republic of China, the ratio for silver dollars was an additional 1.5%. Recently, in August of this year, it was set at an additional 3%. When the Guangdong situation was unified, politics were clarified, and a new beginning was made with the people, the central government remembered the sufferings of the people of Guangdong over the years under cruel governance and heavy burdens, and resolutely banned opium and gambling, abolished harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and relieved the people of Guangdong from suffering. Suddenly, the ratio for silver dollars was raised to an additional 5%. The harm to the people has not yet been thoroughly eliminated, and the burden of higher water compensation has been abruptly increased, which is not worth the loss. How can the people's lives bear it? Guangdong Province has suffered the impact of the world's economic downturn for years, and all industries have declined. If we add the high water compensation for exchanging mill notes for silver dollars, then the mill notes issued and circulated in the market by the two banks of the province and city amount to more than 100 million yuan. Discounting by an additional 5%, only about 80 million silver dollars can be obtained, which is invisibly one-third less. The entire economy of Guangdong is tantamount to bankruptcy. How can we hope for its recovery? It is more than enough to maintain it in many ways, but one end is destroyed and there is more than enough. The provincial business community has discussed it repeatedly in recent days, and unanimously decided that the ratio of mill notes to silver dollars should be set at an additional 3% for water compensation, which is indeed appropriate. Judging from the public opinion of all sectors, it is also the same. The entire membership of our association has further studied it and believes that the economic life and death of Guangdong Province is at a critical juncture, and the gains and losses are of great importance. Moreover, exchanging mill notes for silver dollars is nothing more than exchanging notes for notes. Even if it is exchanged at the same price, the central government's finances will not suffer any losses, while the economy of the people of Guangdong will regain a slightly higher position. If it can be balanced with foreign exchange in the future, then all industries will be easier to maintain, and vitality can be gradually restored. We are grateful to the central government for its kindness, and the people of Guangdong have made a contribution equal to rebuilding. We earnestly request the government officials to give special consideration, listen to the public opinion of the entire province, and issue a clear order that Guangdong Province's mill notes be allowed to follow the ratio of an additional 3% for silver dollars, so as to reassure the people and maintain the Guangdong situation. The Guangzhou Industrial Federation, all members, respectfully bow." (December 12)</p>
<h3>Huainan Railway Expands Joint Transportation; Huai River Shipping Increases Schedules; Railway Expands Joint Transportation Stations</h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Since the Huainan Railway launched the Huai River joint transportation, water and land transportation has been quite convenient, and business is booming. The Huai River Shipping Cooperative, which handles joint transportation here, initially only used the Feipeng and Feiying steamboats to operate the short Beng-Tian route, traveling between Bengbu and Tianjia'an. Later, as passenger and cargo increased and ships were insufficient, they purchased a Lishang small wheel and leased a Hui Xing diesel boat from Hui Tong Company, successively joining the route. Before long, the Huaijia, Jianghuai, Yingshang, and Tai'an four small wheels of Changzhun Company also joined the cooperative. At this point, the joint transportation office had eight ships, operating on a rotating schedule. Last month, the Beng-Zheng long route was added, with two express boats traveling between Bengbu and Zhengyang, respectively. Recently, the Beng-Huai short route has been added, with four upbound and downbound ships operating daily between Bengbu and Huaiyuan, to facilitate merchants and travelers. It was test-sailed yesterday (11th) and the results were good. And the goods near the cooperative wharf are piled up like mountains. The company recently set up a freight station to facilitate the stacking of goods. The Huainan Railway, in order to facilitate merchants and promote joint transportation, has been approved by the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Jiangnan Railways to handle the joint transportation of ordinary goods in addition to joint transportation for goods such as rice, wheat, and soybeans. All cargo names and full or partial carloads are not restricted. The two railways have also opened up freight originating on the Huainan Railway, and the joint transportation stations have been expanded, adding various wharfs along the Huai River that belong to the Huai River Shipping Cooperative as joint transportation stations. They have already jointly revised the interim measures for the three-railway cargo joint transportation and submitted them to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. It has been temporarily approved to follow and implement expansion.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province: Bumper Cotton Harvest This Year; Cotton Fields Exceed 560,000 Mu; Output Exceeds 240,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Quzhou Dispatch: Zhejiang Province has always been known as a region with abundant cotton production in the southeast. In recent years, the provincial authorities have actively implemented production and construction, and have made efforts to promote cotton planting. The improved cotton fields in various counties have increased from several thousand mu to more than 100,000 mu, and the production of upland cotton has increased from several thousand dan to more than 100,000 dan. The increase in rural income has been estimated at more than one million yuan. This year, the promotion of cotton fields in various counties has reached more than 100,000 mu, including 50,000 mu planted with Million China Cotton in the implementation areas of Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Yuyao, and 60,000 mu planted with acclimatized American cotton in the implementation areas of Haiyan, Shangyu, Cixi, Zhenhai, and Dinghai. This year, due to suitable weather, even rainfall, and the guidance of promotion personnel, sowing, fertilization, weeding, and pest control were carried out in accordance with the predetermined procedures. Cotton farmers in various places have been willing to accept it because they have sold at good prices for many years. Therefore, the bumper harvest of improved cotton this year is unprecedented. The Million China Cotton in the Xiaoshan implementation area and the acclimatized American cotton in Nanhong Village and Meishan Island in the Zhenhai implementation area are considered the best. The yield of Million China Cotton is more than 150 catties per mu, and the yield of acclimatized American cotton is more than 200 catties per mu, with some reaching 300 catties. The yields in the Haiyan and Yuyao implementation areas are also good. In total, among the more than 20 counties that produce cotton in the province, the largest producer is Yuyao, with 15,000 mu of improved cotton fields, producing 11,520 dan, and 745,762 mu of native cotton fields, producing 563,796 dan. The total area of native cotton and improved cotton is 760,763 mu, and the total output is 575,316 dan. Second is Xiaoshan, with 16,000 mu of improved cotton fields, producing 61,440 dan, and 246,005 mu of native cotton fields, producing 88,560 dan. The total area is 262,000 mu and the output is 94,704 dan. Third is Pinghu, with 1,200 mu of improved cotton fields, producing 641 dan, and 138,800 mu of native cotton fields, producing 49,963 dan. The total area is 140,000 mu and the output is 50,429 dan. The remaining 10+ counties, including Cixi, have a total of 63,200 mu of improved cotton fields, producing 34,147 dan, and a total of 496,091 mu of native cotton fields, producing 198,070 dan. The total area of cotton fields in each county is 561,285 mu, and the total output is 244,212 dan. The average yield per mu is 180 catties of improved seed cotton and 137 catties of native seed cotton. According to the market price last month, each mu can earn 29 yuan, 5 jiao, and 3 fen of silver, and each mu of native cotton can earn 20 yuan, 6 jiao, and 4 fen of silver. The income from one mu of improved cotton is on average about 9 yuan higher than that of native cotton. If we consider the recent soaring price of cotton yarn, the estimated value will still be more than this amount. (December 11)</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Rice Market Suddenly Falls</h3>

The price of rice such as coarse rice and white rice has fallen by about 5 jiao per dan, and the price of rice such as japonica rice and indica rice has fallen by more than 2 jiao. Wheat has also fallen by about 2 jiao. Merchants from Xi'an who had ordered rice and grain in Wuxi had shipped 7,000 to 8,000 shi in the past two days, and there are still more than 20,000 shi of rice and grain piled up at the station, waiting to be loaded and shipped.</p>

<h3>Changzhou: Confiscated Export Rice</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government complied with the Executive Yuan's order to lift the ban on rice exports, according to the Zhenhai Customs investigation, the number of rice shipments transported by ships and lighters has reached more than 5,000 shi in recent days. Merchants are hoarding and speculating, and rice prices are soaring everywhere. Zhang Mingfu, the manager of the Hengtai Rice Store in Xutang Town in the fourth district of Wuyi, hired a boat the night before last to load more than 100 shi of rice, but it is unknown where it was being transported. Chen Zhesheng, the director of the ship inspection office in the town, sent someone to investigate. Since there was no transportation passport and no sales location, it was immediately detained. On one hand, the security team stationed in the town was guarding it, and on the other hand, Director Chen reported to Wang Zushu, the district chief of the fourth district, who telegraphed the county government for verification. The county government then telegraphed the provincial government for instructions on how to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Confiscated Smuggled Rice</h3>
<p>It is recently learned that a certain party is buying a large amount of grain, so all parties are paying close attention to the transportation of food at various ports. Ten days ago, the Xunpu port here was intercepted by the patrol ship of the town office and seized two rice boats carrying more than 90 shi of rice. There was no rice transportation passport. Shen Chuan's Xia Donglin claimed to have been entrusted by Chongming rice merchant Ni Shengmao to come to Changshu to purchase rice. After being investigated by the county government, it was confirmed that it was smuggled out of the country. It has now been reported to the provincial government for approval. In accordance with the measures prohibiting rice exports, all of it will be confiscated and turned over to the public, and 40% will be used as a reward for those who handled the case. The county government is now recruiting merchants to auction it off, which can fetch about 600 yuan. It is also reported that the Baimao port security detachment also seized a smuggled rice boat and will handle it in the same way.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Water Patrol Team Seizes Opium</h3>
<p>The provincial capital's water patrol team, based on reports that a large amount of opium was being transported to the Bagang port for sale, dispatched multiple detectives and other personnel, traveling by boat to the port on the 7th. They seized 45 bags of opium at the Datong Wheel Branch dock, and then arrested the branch manager Yan Zhenglu, the opium offender Yan Hanzhang, and a Mr. Zhang from the Hongda Tea House, and transferred them to the province for disposal.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Unrest in the Lower Reaches of the Changhuai River</h3>
<p>The Hongze Lake area in the lower reaches of the Changhuai River has always been a breeding ground for bandits. In this year of famine, the *Huanfu* are restless, and the bandits are lurking and multiplying. Recently, scattered bandits have been discovered near Shuanggou, taking the opportunity to rob and loot. Chen Shaowu Hotel in the town was recently robbed clean, and the owner was stabbed and a child was kidnapped. Yang Zehuan, the director of the Wuhe Water Police Bureau, sent a team to suppress the bandits, killing the hostage and capturing the bandits Chen Zhiyou and the suspected boatman Lu Huai. They were all escorted to Bengbu and handed over to the judicial section of the Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu's Report at the City Government Yesterday: Sanctioning Rebellion to Save the Nation; Hoping Citizens Remain Calm and Support National Policy; Wishing Mr. Zhang Would Realize His Error and Consider the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the city government held its weekly memorial service yesterday morning, during which Mayor Wu reported on "Sanctioning Rebellion to Save the Nation." The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Comrades, today there is a very important matter to report to you. This important matter, I believe you have already seen in yesterday's and today's newspapers. This matter is the rebellion of Zhang Xueliang's troops in Xi'an on the 12th, their surrender to the Communist Party, and the encirclement of Chairman Chiang in Xi'an. This can be considered the most unfortunate and heartbreaking event in the history of China's revival. This has dealt a great blow to the construction of our new China, the revival of the Chinese nation, and the arduous work of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country. After this incident occurred, it can truly be said that "it saddens those who are close and gladdens those who are enemies."</p>
<p>For the past ten years, the people of China have encountered unprecedented difficulties and dangers. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, we have achieved what we have today amidst these unprecedented difficulties and dangers. Today's achievements, progress, and construction in China are so great and rapid that they are unmatched by any era in Chinese history. This great and rapid achievement is a ray of dawn for the revival of the Chinese nation and gives the people of the country the belief that the Chinese nation will not perish. Now, just when China's future is beginning to show a glimmer of hope, and when the domestic and foreign affairs departments have found solutions, such a heartbreaking and unfortunate event has occurred. Naturally, this has dealt a great blow to our country's future. If we do not respond properly to this blow, our country's fate will decline from this point onward. In the process of building a new China, the initial condition required is to have a leader to command it so that the strength of the whole country can be concentrated and effectively developed. The cultivation of a great leader cannot be achieved in three or four years; it requires long-term efforts. Chairman Chiang is diligent, responsible, and strives for the country. His decades of meritorious service in following the Premier, his civil and military achievements, are too numerous to mention. It is no easy feat for him to be universally loved and supported by the people. Now, let us first list the major achievements of Chairman Chiang's leadership of the people of the country in the past ten years, as follows: First, the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. Second, the establishment of the foundation of the National Government in Nanjing, providing the whole country with a unified government. Third, in the past two or three decades, the people of the country have never been able to achieve true unity, but today we have finally achieved true unity. Fourth, in the past, the people of the country passively obeyed the government. Today, the people of the country not only passively obey the government but also actively cooperate with the government and support the government. The strength of our entire country has been concentrated. Fifth, the most important aspect of China's construction is transportation. Due to China's vast territory and inconvenient transportation, all undertakings could not be implemented as scheduled. In recent years, among the active construction projects throughout the country, the most difficult one is transportation construction, such as highways and railways throughout the country, which we have already built. Sixth, the popularization of mass education, the improvement of mass knowledge, the development of national consciousness, the strict enforcement of national discipline, and the advocacy and implementation of the New Life Movement are all great works in the spiritual construction of the nation. These are some of the achievements made by Chairman Chiang in leading the people of the country during the period related to China's revival. This achievement is the foundation for the revival of the Chinese nation. Unexpectedly, today, Chairman Chiang, who is leading the people of the country to strive for national revival, is besieged by rebel troops, causing a great blow to the future of the Chinese nation's revival. This is truly a very important and heartbreaking event.</p>
<p>Why did Zhang Xueliang rebel? Because Zhang Xueliang is responsible for suppressing bandits in the Northwest. However, in recent years, his performance in suppressing bandits in the Northwest has not been very good. Not only is his performance in suppressing bandits poor, but his strength has also suffered considerable losses due to the suppression of bandits. Because his troops cannot suppress bandits, he feels that suppressing bandits is difficult. Because suppressing bandits is difficult, he is unwilling to suppress bandits. However, he does not say that he is unwilling to suppress bandits but uses the pretext of advocating tolerance of the Communists to cover up his failure to suppress bandits. In the process of our National Revolution, we encountered an unprecedented foreign invasion, which almost caused the people of the country to panic. At the same time, China has been plagued by the Communist Party. If we had only encountered foreign invasions in the process of the National Revolution without the disturbance of the Communist Party and the Communists' internal restraint, we believe that the current national crisis could have been resolved with considerable certainty. At the very least, we could have prevented the national crisis from escalating to its current state. The main reason why China's current national crisis is so serious, to the extent that we still do not have complete confidence in resolving the national crisis, is the Chinese Red bandits. In the past, the Chinese Red bandits disturbed the borders of provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, and Zhejiang for six or seven years, causing incalculable losses to the people of those provinces and restraining hundreds of thousands of our national troops. Since the Red bandits in Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces were besieged by our national troops on a large scale last year, they suffered a crushing defeat and fled westward to the areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, where they have been causing disturbances for two or three years, restraining many national troops. Therefore, the Communist Party has been causing disturbances in China for nearly ten years. During these ten years, not only have various parts of China suffered incalculable losses, but our national construction has also been restrained, preventing us from using all our strength to cope with foreign invasions and resolve the national crisis. Furthermore, the reason why we cannot tolerate the Communists is that, first, our most pressing need now is national self-determination and independence, while the Communists advocate class struggle and divide the strength of the nation. Second, the Communists rely on the Third International, making them red traitors and pseudo-bandits of foreign aggression. Foreign aggression is already enough to threaten China, and the Communists' internal rebellion is also a major disaster for the Chinese nation. Therefore, communism can never save China. The doctrine that truly suits China and can save China is the Three Principles of the People. If we want China not to perish, to be independent, and to revive, we must not only not tolerate the Red bandits but also fundamentally eliminate them. If we want to build a new China and revive the Chinese nation, we must eliminate the Red bandits. If we want to resist foreign aggression and save the country, we must eliminate the Red bandits. Therefore, Chairman Chiang wants to first pacify the internal situation and then resist foreign aggression, to concentrate the strength of the whole country after the domestic situation is stabilized and unite against foreign aggression. If the country is not unified and there are Red bandits causing disturbances domestically, we cannot resist foreign aggression. This is a very simple and obvious principle.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's tolerance of the Communists this time violates our country's national policy. What is our national policy? Our national policy is to suppress bandits, eliminate traitors, resist foreign aggression, and save the country. To suppress Red bandits, eliminate traitors, resist foreign aggression, and save the country is our national policy. Zhang Xueliang's alliance with the Communists violates the national policy, which means opposing the 450 million people of the country and overturning our country against the public will of the people. His encirclement of Chairman Chiang is a major blow to the people of the country at a time when they are actively working to save themselves, seek survival, and revive the nation. This blow will not only cause our work to save ourselves and seek survival to come to a halt but also pose a great danger to the future of our country and nation. Under the current circumstances, the people of the country should realize the gravity of this matter and unite to support Chairman Chiang. They should also demand that Zhang Xueliang restore Chairman Chiang's freedom as soon as possible, so that our country does not lose its center of gravity, with a very serious attitude unanimously throughout the country. At the same time, the people of the country should also unanimously support the National Government and its national policy of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country, and support the central government's measures to deal with Zhang Xueliang. Locally, we should strictly guard against the Communist Party and all other traitors who are causing disturbances, spreading rumors, and inciting trouble. The people of the country should understand the seriousness of the national crisis and unite under the leadership of the central government to carry out the work of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country. They should not lightly believe rumors, disrupt their steps, and be taken advantage of by the enemy. Shanghai, in particular, is the economic center of our country, and Shanghai is of great importance to the country. The citizens of Shanghai, in addition to being deeply saddened by this unexpected blow, should be very calm and composed in dealing with this situation, await the government's handling, and the government bears full responsibility for Shanghai's security and will absolutely not allow it to have any impact on local security. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will remain calm and composed and work together with the Shanghai Municipal Government to maintain this difficult situation. If the people of the country, especially the citizens of Shanghai, can remain calm and composed, await the government's handling of the Xi'an Incident, and unite to support the National Government and Chairman Chiang, I believe that this incident can be resolved without difficulty. Because there are many people in Zhang Xueliang's subordinates in Xi'an who are deeply aware of the righteousness, and Zhang Xueliang himself, in taking this wrong action, is probably forced by the environment and not entirely acting on his own initiative. I think he would not dare to completely disregard the public will of the people of the country and act arbitrarily. Therefore, as long as the people of the country remain calm and support the government, I dare say that this matter will be resolved quickly.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Meets with Reporters and Makes Important Remarks; Whether to Go to Xi'an Awaits Government Orders; Song Remains in Shanghai at Kong's Request to Stabilize the Financial Market</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, returned to Shanghai from his inspection tour of Guangdong and Guangxi the day before yesterday. At noon yesterday, he met with reporters at the Bank of China and made the following important remarks:</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident Must Be Resolved Quickly</p>
<p>According to Song, regarding the Xi'an Incident, the news he received was the same as reported. President Chiang is absolutely safe in Xi'an. He believes that the Xi'an Incident is the most unfortunate event for the country. Currently, effective methods must be used to resolve it in the shortest possible time, as the eyes of the world are focused on China. His personal and official relationship with President Chiang and his long-standing friendship with Zhang Xueliang are well-known. In this special relationship, if there are any possible solutions, he is willing to make his best efforts under the guidance of the government. As for what methods to take, it must be decided by the government. Whether it is necessary for him to make a trip to Xi'an also awaits orders from the government. Endona has arrived in Luoyang and will soon transfer to Xi'an. He was instructed by Finance Minister Kong to stay in Shanghai to take care of financial matters. Currently, the market is relatively stable. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications continue to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Will Develop Very Rapidly</p>
<p>Song continued to describe his visit to Guangdong, saying that this was his second return to Guangdong since he left with the Northern Expeditionary Army. His impressions were very deep. He recalled that during the Northern Expedition, he discussed major party and national policies in Guangdong and formulated two plans: one was to reorganize the economy of Guangdong Province to consolidate the foundation of the party and state, and the other was to launch the Northern Expedition to complete the revolution. At that time, it was decided to adopt the latter, so the Northern Expedition was launched, and the economy of Guangdong Province fell into stagnation. For several years, it was isolated from other provinces. The most obvious examples are: (1) the difference in the monetary system, and the exchange with other provinces required conversion through Hong Kong dollars, and (2) the obstruction of transportation, which was previously all by sea. Now that unification is complete and the Yuehan Railway is open to traffic, it has become one with the country economically, and its future development will be very rapid and grand.</p>
<p>Shanghai Financial Circles Invest in Guangdong</p>
<p>Discussing Guangdong's economic policy, previously, due to the state of separation, it was based on a single province. For example, Guangdong Province does not produce cotton, but it also operates its own yarn factories. Other industries also follow the principle of self-sufficiency. The people of Guangdong eat rice, but their own production is insufficient, so they rely on Siam, resulting in a huge leakage. Now that transportation has improved and unification has been completed, its economic plan naturally takes the country as a unit. This is a natural trend. Guangdong Province is rich, and its future development will be unlimited. Previously, the financial circles did not move forward because the monetary system was not unified. Now, they are investing, such as Bank of Communications, Jin City Bank, and the Mainland Bank, all of which are planning to set up branches. Recently, because food rice has been manipulated by merchants, and grain prices have risen, the provincial authorities are negotiating with the financial circles to transport Hunan rice to regulate the people's food supply. From this alone, it can be seen that the revival of Guangdong Province and the general economic and financial relations of the country are interrelated.</p>
<p>Development Plans Emphasize Various Points</p>
<p>Zhu also said that he had visited Hainan Island, and there were two reasons for this: he was originally from Wenchang County, Hainan, and conveniently returned to his hometown to visit, and the island's special position in China's economy made it necessary to seek development. Song said that he had spoken in detail to reporters in Wenchang, which he believed had been reported. However, in general, although our country is vast and rich in resources, only Hainan Island has tropical products, such as rubber trees, betel nuts, coffee, and rich minerals, especially tin. Our country has a huge trade deficit every year, and many tropical products are imported. Developing the island can recover a lot of leakage, and its importance to the domestic economy can be imagined. As for the most important development plans, they are: 1. Opening up seaports and building ports near Haikou. 2. Building a railway from the seaport east through Wenchang to the south of the island to facilitate the transportation of products, costing approximately 25 million to 30 million yuan. In Guangdong Province, it is planned to build the Yuegui Railway to reach Fujian in the east and Jiangxi in the north, which is very important economically and defensively, costing approximately 44.5 million yuan. The Huangpu Port is planned to be built into a second-class port. The first step is to deepen the Pearl River so that merchant ships of 8,000 to 9,000 tons can enter and exit the port, at a cost of approximately 6 million yuan. Subsequent progress will involve the construction of wharves, warehouses, and railways. The provincial authorities are actively carrying out the above plans, and the National Economic Council will provide technical assistance in the future.</p>
<p>Guangxi's Way Out Lies in Minerals</p>
<p>Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi are both old friends. He was invited to Guangxi for a pleasant gathering and conveniently inspected Guangxi's economic situation. He did not discuss any political or financial issues. Guangxi is extremely poor, but the province is well-organized, so it can cope with economic difficulties. Guangxi was originally a province with a trade deficit, but recently, it has worked hard to produce and resist the import of luxury goods, which has reduced the amount of the trade deficit. Guangxi has many minerals, and its economic way out in the future should be in this area. After the reform of the monetary system in Guangxi, the financial circles will rush to set up branches, just like the current situation in Guangdong Province.</p>
<h3>After the Xi'an Incident, Shanghai-Shaanxi Remittances Continue as Usual; Eurasia Aircraft Cease Landing in Xi'an; Longhai Railway Stops Operations; Telegraphs Above Tongguan Still Not Open Last Night</h3>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident, remittances between Shanghai and Shaanxi were still accepted by various banks. Shanghai-Xinjiang aircraft stopped landing in Xi'an and other places. Telegraph communications between Shanghai and Shaanxi were still not open above Tongguan as of last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Shaanxi Remittances Continue to Be Accepted</p>
<p>Xi'an is the capital of Shaanxi Province. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Farmers' Bank, and Shanghai Bank all have branches there to handle domestic remittances. Since the Xi'an Incident, regarding remittances from Shanghai to various places in Shaanxi Province, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Bank of China last night. All of the above banks are still accepting remittances as usual. However, since the industry believes that Xi'an and other places are very chaotic, remittances are temporarily being observed, and the amount has therefore decreased sharply.</p>
<p>Land and Air Transportation Are Affected</p>
<p>Although the Eurasia Airlines' Shanghai-Xinjiang aircraft are still flying as usual, they have stopped landing in Xi'an when passing through. As for the Lanzhou-Baotou line, the Ningxia-Lanzhou section has been suspended. The company has not received reports on the Baotou-Ningxia section. After the Longhai Railway temporarily opened to Huayin, freight cars on the railway were temporarily suspended due to busy transportation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has reduced the number of ships traveling to Lianyungang.</p>
<p>Telegraphs Above Tongguan Are Blocked</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications yesterday, telegraphs in Shaanxi Province above Tongguan, such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, Huayin, Chishui, Weinan, Lingkou, Xinfeng, Lintong, Xianyang, Baishui, , Jiji, Pucheng, and Sanyuan, were still blocked and not open as of last night. However, telegraphs in various places along the Longhai Railway below Tongguan were open as usual.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Strictly Preventing Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Order to Not Neglect Work or Strike; Order to Strictly Prevent Reactionary Elements</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee for the Xi'an Incident to discuss countermeasures, decided to strictly prevent the occurrence of labor disputes, and prevent the activities of reactionary elements. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures Decided at the Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at 10:00 AM yesterday, attended by Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Na Xubai, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Kechang, Long Peiyun, Gong Yuting, Li Hua, and more than a dozen others. First, Chairman Zhu Xuefan reported on the sudden outbreak of the Xi'an Incident, which caused nationwide outrage. The Federation had already telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to rein in his horse on the brink of the precipice. In order to prevent the activities of reactionary elements, this meeting was convened again to discuss measures. The following cases were resolved: (1) To convene a meeting of various trade unions on the 15th to report on the incident and hope that the comrades in the labor community will deal with it calmly. (2) To order various trade unions to strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to be active and absolutely avoid the occurrence of labor disputes. (3) To petition the party and government agencies to jointly issue a notice, severely warning capital in this critical period not to lay off workers or reduce wages, causing disputes. (4) To telegraph national mass organizations, requesting them to send representatives to Xi'an to personally persuade Zhang Xueliang to cease hostilities and restore Chairman Chiang's freedom. (5) To unite with groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and local associations to concentrate steps and jointly deal with the emergency incident, and to push Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Shao Xubai to contact separately.</p>
<p>Order Various Trade Unions to Strictly Prevent Labor Disputes</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued an order to all affiliated trade unions in the city yesterday, stating, "In order to issue a notice, the Xi'an Incident has occurred, and the situation is extremely critical. Our city's workers should take a calm and composed attitude, quietly await the proper handling by the central government, and strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to be active to maintain local order. If there are any labor-capital disputes in various industries, they should be submitted to the party and government agencies for mediation in accordance with legal procedures. It is absolutely forbidden to neglect work or strike, causing labor disputes, and giving villains an opportunity to take advantage of. In addition to submitting it to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government, please issue a joint notice, severely warning the capital of various industries not to take the opportunity to lay off workers or reduce wages, causing disputes. It is ordered that various trade unions immediately order the affiliated workers to comply with it together. This order."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Organizations Unanimously Telegraph Zhang Xueliang Urging Him to Protect Chiang, Cherish National Vitality, and Strive Together to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>Five Organizations Including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Associations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Associations, Bankers' Association, and Money Trade Association jointly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang urging him to exercise restraint, and also telegraphed Yan Xishan to continue suppressing the bandits in Suiyuan. The original telegram reads: (1) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the people of the whole country have been extremely excited and eagerly anticipating a unified effort to save the nation. Is there any other way? Even if there are occasional differences in political views, they can be discussed frankly with the aim of achieving perfection. How can one rely on force and coercion, destroying one's own line of defense? We specially send this telegram to urge you to prioritize the future of the country and the nation, protect the safety of Chiang Kai-shek, cherish the nation's vitality, strive for peace, and save China. We eagerly await your reply. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Associations, Bankers' Association, Money Trade Association, and Shipping Association. (2) To Deputy Chairman Yan of Taiyuan, The Xi'an Incident has shocked the whole country. We earnestly request you to quickly arrange for the rescue of Chiang Kai-shek from nearby. The military situation in Suiyuan and Chahar is at a critical juncture. We hope that you will, based on the established principles of the Central Government, fully shoulder the responsibility and continue the suppression of bandits, lest they take advantage of the situation. The citizens of Shanghai are willing to fully support you. We respectfully present our views and hope you will take them into consideration. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Local Associations.</p>
<p>Ningbo Native Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai, regarding the Xi'an Incident and the abduction of Chairman Chiang, which is of utmost importance to the country's safety and well-being, convened an emergency meeting. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Le Zhenbao, Yuan Ludeng, Chen Zhonggao, Shui Xiangyun, Xu Shengchan, Fu Xiao'an, Fang Jiaobo, He Shaoting, Ye Xianggao, Le Rucheng, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Zuo, Mao Heyuan, Zhang Yongni, Jin Tingsun, Zhang Jiguang, Yan Fang, Zhu Meixian, Shi Zhikun, and Wu Chongjin, among others. Chaired by Yu Qiaqing, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn. It was resolved to send a special telegram to Zhang Xueliang to protect Chairman Chiang and release the soldiers. There was also a lengthy discussion on maintaining social and economic stability. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, At a time when foreign troubles are frequent, and the people of the country should be united, we suddenly hear that your subordinates have different opinions, causing Chairman Chiang to be trapped in a dangerous situation, which deeply alarms us. We believe that Chairman Chiang is the commander-in-chief of the entire country and his safety is of utmost importance. We earnestly hope that you will pull back from the brink, protect him, and release the soldiers to stabilize the overall situation. Respectfully, the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan</p>
<p>To Zhang Hanqing, my younger brother from Xi'an, and all military division commanders, brigade commanders, and regimental commanders of the Northeast Army, I have just heard that your troops suddenly disagreed with Chiang Kai-shek and detained him in Xi'an. I am bedridden and extremely bewildered. Chiang Kai-shek loves the country, is loyal to the public, and possesses great talent and magnanimity, which is admired by all. In the face of national crisis, our safety is tied together. The people revere and support him deeply, and the camaraderie between us is strong. Moreover, he has always shown you loving care from the bottom of his heart. We have supported each other for eight years, always as one. Even if there are differences in political views, you can discuss them sincerely. To resort to military coercion is causing public criticism. The situation is unclear due to blocked communication. Given your upright nature, I do not believe that you would do such a thing. Or is there some other difficulty, forcing you to take risks? I have known you for two generations and am always thinking of you. My concern for the country and love for you is unwavering and grows stronger with age. I earnestly hope that you will consider my humble words, change course immediately, and send Chiang Kai-shek back to Nanjing as soon as possible. All political views should be discussed with the Central Government. This will surely dispel resentment and allow us to overcome difficulties together. Do not be reckless, lest you end up in danger and unease. I sincerely hope you will adopt my humble advice. I am looking westward, eagerly awaiting your reply. Zhu Qinglan.</p>
<p>Hanxue Society</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Hanxue Society telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying, "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, As the Suiyuan Incident unfolds and the nation faces dire difficulties, we are shocked to hear that you have seized the commander-in-chief and staged a military coup. Since the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the country and its people have suffered from internal strife for nearly twenty years. Fortunately, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, with the people's interests at heart and peace as his guiding principle, has strived for unification and construction, leading to the situation we have today. Efforts such as economic recovery, preparations for resisting aggression, and large-scale construction are all entrusted by the people of the whole country to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, with the expectation of rapid completion, which you are well aware of. We never expected that you would suddenly disrupt this progress with such an unfortunate incident. We are truly perplexed and cannot understand. If the above-mentioned great plans for national revival and resisting aggression are not correct, why do you not express your great views so that public opinion can choose whether they are correct or not? If the progress of the above-mentioned national salvation endeavors is not fast enough, you have served the party and the country for many years, so why have we not seen you propose any plans beforehand? As for the chances of success in international relations, one should decide after the start of a national war based on the opportune moment. If it is the will of all the people, it cannot be violated by one or two military leaders. If it is what all the people hate, it cannot be monopolized by one or two military leaders. Therefore, your action of detaining the commander-in-chief has nothing to do with the goals you seek. We do not know why you must take this path. Furthermore, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's leadership position today depends on the collective strength of the people of the whole country. The convergence of the power of the people of the whole country also depends on Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's long-term, continuous, and practical efforts for the welfare of the country and the people. His immense power is built on the collective strength and trust of the people. To seize what the people trust will surely be hated by the people. Since ancient times, none who have done this have escaped destruction. If you are truly for the country and the people, why do you not present your decisions, using peaceful means that do not endanger the foundation of the nation, and submit them to public opinion to determine their acceptance or rejection? At the same time, you should immediately restore the freedom of the supreme commander, so as not to cause significant losses to the future of national defense in the process. In this way, your sincerity and enthusiasm can be fully demonstrated to the masses, and you can gain the understanding of the people of the country. Moreover, we have seen Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's consistent pursuit of peace in the handling of the situation in the Southwest this autumn. We believe you have also already considered this and have no concerns. In this era, if military force can be used for personal gain, then Mr. Chiang Kai-shek would no longer be detained by you. How can you guarantee that no one will follow your example in the future? Time is fleeting and does not allow for delay. This special telegram is sent in the hope that you will accept it. Respectfully, the Shanghai Hanxue Society."</p>
<p>Telegrams from Other Parties</p>
<p>In addition, the party branches of the two railways telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, urging him to pull back from the brink and promptly restore Chairman Chiang's freedom, so as not to affect the country and the nation. The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed, hoping that he would change his plans and remember that we are all in the same boat. Return to the capital quickly, demonstrate virtue, and block evil, to preserve a little integrity for our Chinese people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Executive Committee of the Third District of the Shanghai Municipal Kuomintang also telegraphed, urging him to pull back from the brink, order his subordinates to cease the rebellion and return to the right path. The nation and the country truly rely on this. In addition, the China National Products Maintenance Association telegraphed, urging him to awaken and restore the chairman's freedom, and to allow the Central Government to handle the matter, and not cut himself off from the people. Furthermore, the Northeast Native Association in Shanghai denounced Zhang Xueliang, stating that he had been expelled from the association. Moreover, the Shanghai Loyalty Association issued a public telegram urging him to repent, respectfully escort the chairman back to the capital, and plead guilty. The Central Government is generous and will surely not investigate deeply.</p>
<h3>Four Elders in Shanghai, Wu Zhihui Has Already Gone to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang Will Go Soon</p>
<p>Due to Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, the Central Government is preparing a solution. Important figures in Shanghai, such as Central Committee member Wang Chonghui, had already gone to Nanjing one after another the night before last. It is now known that of the four elders, except for Cai Yuanpei, who is ill, Wu Zhihui went to Nanjing by train the day before yesterday morning. Li Shizeng and Zhang Jingjiang are now awaiting news from all sides and will also go to Nanjing soon. It is currently undecided whether Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, who are stabilizing Shanghai, will also go to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Is Not Feeling Well</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng has not been feeling well recently. The doctor has advised him to rest for a few days. He has declined all social engagements. All important documents are still being processed as usual.</p>
<h3>Expanded Commemorative Week at the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday: The People Should Recognize the Effort, Tao Baichuan's Report Excerpts: Enumerating Zhang Xueliang's Wrongs</h3>
<p>According to the National Society, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters convened more than 500 representatives from various district branches yesterday morning to hold an expanded commemorative week. Standing Committee member Tao Baichuan gave an important report on the current situation. Excerpts from his speech are as follows: (1) On the 12th of this month, Zhang Xueliang suddenly rebelled in Xi'an, leading his troops, while simultaneously detaining Chairman Chiang and issuing a circular telegram advocating the overthrow of the National Government. The Central Government has appropriate measures to deal with this, and all provinces are loyal to the Central Government. Chairman Chiang is currently safe, which is a blessing in disguise. (2) Upon investigation, there are few reasons for Zhang Xueliang's rebellion. Although it is said to be for political reasons, Zhang Xueliang is actually an incompetent Liu A Dou. What politics does he understand? His rebellion is primarily because the Central Government wanted him to suppress the Red bandits, and in order to preserve his power, he not only did not want to suppress the Red bandits, but colluded with them. At the same time, to cover up his mistakes, he chanted the slogan of not suppressing the Red bandits. Therefore, this incident is entirely an old trick of old-style warlords resisting the Central Government to maintain their territories. (3) Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram said that he wanted to fight back to his old home in the Northeast. This is clearly a deception. Who would believe that someone who did not defend his old home in the Northeast and handed it over to others could fight back to the Northeast? Moreover, to fight back to his old home, one must support the leader, consolidate the Central Government, unite internally, and strengthen national power before there is any way to do so. His actions are to overthrow the leader, overthrow the Central Government, dissolve internal unity, and eliminate national power. At worst, China may become a second Spain. How can he fight back to his old home? The Northeast was destroyed by Zhang Xueliang himself. He destroyed the Northeast in the past, and now he is destroying the Northwest. He is truly a sinner of the nation. Can we, the people, tolerate the actions of this sinner? (4) Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram said that he wanted to unite with the Communist Party. This is an extremely dangerous proposal. The Communist Party's background is in the Third International, and the Communist Party's position is class struggle. What China needs now is to make a national self-determination and national independence movement. We cannot allow class struggle to eliminate the power of national struggle. We cannot let the Third International decide our national destiny. Therefore, we cannot unite with the Communist Party. We cannot unite with the traitors of white imperialism, and we cannot unite with the tools of the Second International. (5) Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram said that he wanted to ally with Russia. We should first consider whether Russia has the necessity and determination to wage war against Japan, whether Russia is willing to unite with China, and whether Russia has the power to help China. We have reason to believe that (a) because Japan is trying its best to befriend Russia, because Russia has no reason to fight Japan, and because Russia in Europe is heavily constrained by Italy and Germany, the Soviet Union currently has no determination to wage war against Japan. We admit that expressing friendship and goodwill to the Soviet Union is something that the current government has been diligently doing for a long time, without waiting for Zhang Xueliang to propose it, let alone detaining the leader and rebelling. (6) In short, Zhang Xueliang's rebellion is ungrateful to Chairman Chiang, rebellious against the Central Government, colluding with the Red bandits and the Communist Party, continuing to endanger China, and helping the bandits and puppets in Chahar and Suiyuan to boost their arrogance, destroying our Great Wall. He is suffering from unrequited love for the Soviet Union, and he is digging his own grave. The losses suffered by China as a result are truly unimaginable. Zhang Xueliang is truly a sinner of the country and the nation. (7) Our current tasks are: (a) to reaffirm our support for Chairman Chiang and demand that Zhang Xueliang immediately and unconditionally restore all of Chairman Chiang's freedom; (b) to reaffirm our support for the National Government and its national policy of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country; (c) to support the Central Government's measures to punish Zhang Xueliang; (d) to strictly prevent the Red bandits and the Communist Party, as well as all other traitors, from disturbing the local area; (e) not to allow the Red bandits and the Communist Party, as well as all other traitors, to mix with the people, spread rumors, and incite them; (f) the people should understand the severity of the national crisis and must, under the leadership of the Central Government, carry out the work of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country, and must not easily believe rumors, disrupt their own steps, and be taken advantage of by the enemy. (8) The party and the country are at this serious beginning. All comrades of our party should devote themselves to the party and the country. First, lead the people to do the above six points. Second, everyone must take on the responsibility of the police and detectives to prevent all enemies from shaking people's hearts and undermining security. As the saying goes, "A scholar's integrity is seen in poverty, and a hero is known in times of chaos." Now is the time for us to be tested. May our comrades work hard.</p>

<h3>Women's Comfort Association Continues to Collect Winter Supplies</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Women's Community Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort Association launched the campaign to collect cotton vests, gloves, and other winter supplies, women and school groups from all walks of life, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, have actively donated. The association yesterday received the following donations: (1) Huiqun Girls' School: 101 silk cotton vests, 150 pairs of gloves.

<h3>Red Cross Society Appeals for Donations of First Aid Medicine Kits</h3>
<p>Since the China Red Cross Society unified the organization of the Suiyuan war relief efforts nationwide, many doctors from various places have actively participated. Therefore, there are many talented people at the front line. However, due to the shortage of materials in North China, they all rely on supplies from Shanghai. Each member of the rescue team in Suiyuan must have a medicine kit containing three categories of supplies: (1) surgical instruments, (2) dressing supplies, (3) medicines, all of which are indispensable for rescue work. The quantities have been determined and calculated, and the original cost is 10 yuan in national currency per kit. Now that the society's existing reserves have been successively transported to the front, they are still insufficient for distribution. If a major war occurs, they will be even more needed. We hope that our countrymen and gentlemen will generously donate medicine kits or money to purchase them. With a small amount of money, countless lives can be saved, humanity can be protected, and the nation can be relieved. We urge everyone to quickly initiate donations. Please contact the Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road, or call 34366 for a detailed response.</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations Jointly Appeal to Overseas Chinese for Disaster Relief</h3>
<h3>Telegraphs to Various Consulates and Overseas Chinese Communities, Asking for Maximum Donations of Money and Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity and Police Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to consulates and overseas Chinese business associations in various places: (Titles omitted) "The bandits and puppets have invaded the border. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers have fought bravely and repeatedly defeated the fierce enemy. When you hear this, you should be happy. However, defending against aggression requires sustained effort. To ensure that our soldiers are willing to fight and to inspire the national spirit, it is especially important to ensure that the people in the war zone are not displaced and can fulfill their duties in the rear. The government should be responsible for the replenishment of military supplies, while disaster relief in the rear is the undeniable duty of the people. The Shanghai charity organizations have always taken saving the people as their mission. Therefore, this association has been initiated. All disaster relief measures have been detailed in the Shen Xin newspapers. It is hoped that you are aware. Your association (consulate) has always been known for its love of the motherland and its enthusiasm. You have always actively contributed to disaster relief. The current military disaster in Chahar and Suiyuan is particularly severe. We sincerely appeal to you to uphold your traditional spirit of patriotism, do your best to donate, and remit to the association continuously, whether it be relief goods or money. We will immediately remit them to the disaster area and inspect and distribute them on the ground. Saving the people and saving the country will be deeply appreciated. We hope that you will consider this.

<h3>Meeting Minutes of the National Accountants Association</h3>
<p>The National Accountants Association held its fourth board meeting yesterday at its office at No. 59 Hong Kong Road. Board members Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Xie Lin, Chen Riping, He Yuanming, Wang Haifan, Wang Sifang, Bei Zuyi, Lang Junwei, Wen Yiyou (Jiang representing), Chen Chaolun (Xi representing) attended. Chairman Xie Lin presided over the meeting. (A) Reporting Matters: 5 items (omitted). (B) Discussion Matters: (1) "Upon investigation, the number, names, and brief resumes of the assistant accountants when accountants apply for registration are clearly stipulated in the Accountants Regulations as matters that should be registered. However, the transfer of this registration to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by local industrial and commercial administrative offices varies in speed. Registered accountants and their assistants have no registration certificates to prove their registration. Furthermore, assistants with diplomas in commercial or economic fields from specialized schools need to prove their years of service with the registration date. It is proposed to request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to instruct industrial and commercial administrative offices nationwide to issue a registration certificate to accountants and their assistants upon registration, listing their names, brief resumes, and registration date separately to serve as proof. In addition, it is requested to add the above method to the implementation rules of the Accountants Regulations for permanent compliance." (Resolved) Passed. Director Xie Lin was appointed to draft the petition. (2) "Upon investigation, the organization procedures, establishment date, and list of past officers and membership numbers of each member association are not on file in this association for reference. Should the association draft a form and send it to each association for completion?" (Resolved) Director Bei Zuyi was appointed to draft the form. (3) "Various income tax regulations are currently planned to be compiled into a booklet and distributed to each member association for forwarding to members for reference." (Resolved) 1,000 copies will be printed and distributed to each association immediately.</p>
<h3>Sworn Brothers Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>Xu Xuehui, a native of Songjiang and former director of the Gansu Opium Prohibition Bureau, had his face splashed with nitric acid in March of this year on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. Gao Jinsheng, the perpetrator, was arrested on the spot and sentenced to four years of imprisonment by the Second Special Court, and is currently appealing. However, Xu suddenly filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court, accusing Zhu Guanghan, a wealthy businessman from the same hometown, of instigating Chen Axi to instruct Gao Jinsheng to cause harm, requesting punishment, and demanding compensation of 10,000 yuan for damages. Zhu Guanghan also filed a ten-point defense, stating that he and the plaintiff were sworn brothers for more than ten years, and that recently, due to unsuccessful loan applications, the plaintiff had fabricated accusations and attempted extortion. He also hired attorney Gu Changyuan to file a counterclaim for false accusation. After the court received the complaint, Judge Wu Deying presided over the trial. However, Judge Wu was transferred to the Xuzhou Jiangsu Higher Branch Court by order of the Ministry, so Judge Yu Deren has taken over the trial. Recently, Judge Yu was also transferred to be an execution judge, so the case is now being handled by Judge Liu Bojun, who has scheduled a retrial for the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan May Be Released Soon; Second Special Court Has Approved 20,000 Yuan Bail; Gao Third Branch Court Ruling Will Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a native of Yancheng, was arrested on the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1934 on suspicion of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. After a preliminary trial by the Second Special Court, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. Upon appeal to the Gao Third Branch Court, the original verdict was overturned, and he was declared innocent. However, during the final stage of the appeal trial at the Gao Third Branch Court, another prisoner accused Gu of bribing the guards and bribing Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, known as Xiao Sizi, to recant their confession of instigating perjury. He was also accused of smoking opium in the prison hospital outside Guangci Hospital. The prosecutor of the Second Special Court and the Police Department separately filed public lawsuits. His instigation to perjury case is currently under trial. The opium case has concluded after two trials by the Second Special Court and the Gao Third Branch Court, and he was sentenced to eight months in prison and deprived of his civil rights for one year. The opium case has been sent to prison for execution, with the sentence expiring on January 12 of next year. Gu had previously requested that the time he spent in detention last year be deducted from his sentence, but this was rejected by the Gao Third Branch Court. Gu then applied to the prosecutor of the Gao Third Branch Court for a reduction in his sentence, which was approved by the prosecutor. He then requested a reduction in his sentence from the Criminal Division, which was approved by the Criminal Division, granting a one-month reduction in his sentence. Therefore, Gu has now been released from prison and transferred to the detention center. However, because the Police Department was dissatisfied with Gu's acquittal in the murder case, they requested the prosecutor of the Gao Third Branch Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The instigation to perjury case is being retried by Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court, and the trial has not yet concluded. Gu has now submitted a statement to the Gao Third Branch Court and the Second Special Court, which has been approved, allowing him to find two reputable guarantors and provide a 20,000 yuan guarantee to stop the detention. The ruling from the Gao Third Branch Court has not yet been issued, but it is expected to be approved. Gu's family is rushing to complete the bail procedures. Within ten days, Gu may regain his freedom.</p>
<h3>Cai Fu-fu Accused of Obstructing Family</h3>
<p>Court to Resume Hearing Shortly</p>
<p>I, Cai Fu-fu, also known as Cai Xuzhou, have operated the Ming Yue Lou teahouse on Xiaolin Road, Mabai Road in western Shanghai for many years. Although Cai is over forty years old, he still has a fondness for women. On April 11th of this year, he lured Jin Di, the daughter of Wang Yegen, who resides at No. [Number] in the vegetable market alley on Shenglu Road, to the Hongxiang Hotel for illicit relations. This was discovered by the girl's father, who, together with his wife, rushed to the hotel and apprehended the two. At that time, Cai immediately sought mediation to settle the matter. However, on May 11th, Jin Di suddenly disappeared again. After investigation by Wang Yegen, it was learned that Cai had lured her away again, but her whereabouts remained unknown, making it impossible to report her disappearance to the authorities. It was not until November 16th that Jin Di was found to have died suddenly at the home of her uncle, Chen Xinglin. It is rumored that this resulted from Cai's drunken misconduct. Therefore, Wang immediately reported the matter to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, which detained Cai. Jin Di's body was sent to the court for examination. Although the result indicated death from illness, Wang believes that Cai and Chen conspired to seduce his daughter and has filed a separate complaint with the local court, accusing Cai of obstructing family. The court accepted the complaint and issued two summonses. However, because key witnesses Yin Jubaobao and Cai Futang's wife have not yet come forward, the hearing was postponed. It is reported that the case will be resumed shortly.</p>
<h3>Child Accidentally Eats Opium, Dies from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Liang Jinchun, a 60-year-old Cantonese man, currently works at the Nanjing Capital Grand Theater. Five years ago in Shanghai, he took a Suzhou woman, Shi (22 years old this year), as his concubine. Over the past five years, they have had three sons. The eldest son is five years old this year, the second son is four years old, and the youngest son, A Xin, is just two years old. Liang is in Nanjing, while Shi lives with the three children in a three-story building at No. B442, Xinmin Village, Malang Road in the French Concession. A few days ago, Shi suddenly suffered from a headache and purchased a small box of opium, costing [Number] jiao, to make headache paste. The remaining opium paste was placed on a table. On the night of the [Number]th, Shi's youngest son, A Xin, played with the paste and asked for a biscuit. Shi did not notice that the biscuit in the child's hand was contaminated with the paste. As a result, he was poisoned. At seven o'clock the next morning, the child had a seizure due to the poisoning. Shi then realized what had happened and immediately sent him to Guangci Hospital. However, the child's internal organs had been severely damaged by the poison, and treatment was ineffective. He died at two o'clock yesterday morning. The hospital reported the incident to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The child's body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Special Second Court, and a court police officer went to the hall and confirmed that the death of Liang A Xin was indeed due to accidental opium poisoning. The body was handed over to the mother for burial.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhongfen Case: Litigation Unresolved; Liu Huizhen Sues for Son's Upbringing Expenses, Claiming $9,600</h3>
<p>Yang Zhongfen, a secretary at the Zhongnan Bank from Fujian, previously cohabitated with Liu Huizhen, a prostitute from the Meiyu brothel. Subsequently, a son was born, named A Li. However, after A Li's birth, Yang suddenly abandoned both Liu and A Li. Liu filed an abandonment lawsuit against Yang in the First Special District Court. After a trial, the court sentenced Yang to six months imprisonment, with a suspended sentence. Yang was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Now, Liu has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, claiming that A Li is one year old and that the costs from now until his adulthood will be substantial. She argues that Yang should bear these costs, and therefore requests the court to order Yang to pay A Li's upbringing expenses of 50 yuan per month until he reaches the age of sixteen, totaling 9,600 yuan in national currency. This case was originally handled by Judge Tao Dejun, but due to Judge Tao's illness, Judge Xu Fuji is acting as a proxy. Yesterday, the Fourth Civil Division held a hearing, issuing an order for a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case on Shanhai Pass Road: One Thief Apprehended</h3>
<p>Victim's Losses Valued at One Thousand Gold</p>
<p>At around 7 p.m. last night, four bandits suddenly went to the residence of a [Surname] family at No. 817, Shanhai Pass Road, to carry out a robbery. Only two of the bandits carried handguns. After entering the house, they confined all the men and women inside, and then began to search and loot. They left after about half an hour, having stolen property worth more than four thousand gold. However, when the bandits left the house, the police on duty in the area had already received a report. Upon seeing the bandits escaping, they ordered them to stop. In desperation, the bandits fired a shot. The police returned fire, knocking down one of the bandits and seizing a handgun. The remaining bandits escaped. The apprehended bandit was immediately taken to the police station, pending the capture of his accomplices.</p>
<h3>House Collapse on Zhejiang Road Injures People</h3>
<p>A house belonging to the Yiyuan pawnshop at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road in the Public Concession was in disrepair. Workers were hired to repair it a few days ago. Unexpectedly, at around 10 p.m. last night, the high wall along the road suddenly collapsed with a crash. Some pedestrians were buried in the rubble. Patrol officers who heard the noise arrived and reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the scene to maintain order. The injured pedestrians were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, their injuries were not serious, and they were discharged after being bandaged. The collapse of the wall blocked traffic, which was quickly restored.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Organizes Maternal and Infant Health Services</h3>

<h3>Rickshaw Inspections Have Now Begun</h3>
<p>Rickshaws, or Category B collapsible vehicles, in the Public Concession, that is, handcarts whose load does not exceed five pounds, are inspected annually by the Traffic Section of the Police Department as usual. The inspection period for this year is from the 14th to the 31st of this month. Therefore, this inspection has already begun since yesterday. However, there are not many days left.

<h3>Rainfall Reduced This Year: Yangtze River Approaching Dryness</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou Water Level Lowest at Just Over Two Feet; Navigation Difficult, Shipping Companies All Complaining Bitterly</p>
<p>Although Shanghai yesterday recovered with drizzling rain, the rainy season is over, so the amount of rain poured is very small. Compared with last year, it is even less. At the same time, the climate is warm, and rice borers in the fields cannot be killed, causing great damage to crops. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reduced Rainfall</p>
<p>A reporter learned from the Junchu Dredging Bureau that the amount of rainfall in Shanghai last month was only 1.85 inches. Compared with the rainfall of 3.2 [Number] inches in the same period last year, it decreased by more than 1.5 [Number] inches. Furthermore, in October of this year, Shanghai did not have any rainfall, so the climate this year is extremely dry. Therefore, infectious diseases in winter are also more numerous than last year. Recently, the weather has been warm, unlike winter, so rice borers in the fields cannot be killed and are easily bred. Therefore, crops will be damaged.</p>
<p>River Water Dry</p>
<p>At the same time, the amount of rainfall in the Yangtze River Basin this year is less than that of Shanghai. As a result, the water level along the river is falling daily and is approaching the trend of dryness. A reporter learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that the water levels along the coast from Wusong to Xuanxang are as follows: Yichang, the 14th, 2 feet 2 inches; Hankou, 2 feet 4 inches; Jiujiang, 4 feet 5 inches; Anqing, 3 feet 80 [Number] inches; Wuhu, 3 feet 6 inches; Zhenjiang, 6 feet 1 inch.</p>
<p>Difficult Navigation</p>
<p>The navigation draft limit is 12 feet 1 inch for the Wuhu to Jiujiang section downstream and only 9 feet 6 inches for the Jiujiang to Hankou section. As a result, medium-sized ships with slightly heavier drafts are also difficult to navigate. In particularly shallow areas, transportation is impossible without reducing the load and using barges. Although shipping companies have already increased shallow water fees, due to the early arrival of the shallow water season, operations are difficult, and business is declining. Everyone is complaining bitterly.</p>
<h3>Tang Hao and Others Advise Shi Liang to Surrender Because the One-Week Deadline is Approaching</h3>
<p>Lawyer Shi Liang, along with Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, etc., who were arrested at the same time, was released on bail at the time, but avoided surrendering to the authorities. Therefore, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office held a court session on the 12th of this month. That night, lawyers Tang Hao and Zhang Zhirang presented Shi Liang's handwritten letter in court, agreeing to extend the deadline by one week to surrender herself, etc. This has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that lawyers Tang and Zhang, with half of the one-week deadline passed, published a notice yesterday, earnestly advising Shi Liang to surrender herself due to illness as soon as possible. The notice is recorded below. On the 12th of this month, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office held a court session and presented a letter sent from Suzhou as evidence. They were ordered to earnestly advise you to come to the case. You can go to the Second Special Court or the Third Branch of the High Court. It is even easier to go to the Jiangsu High Court nearby. The court order is very earnest and allowed an extension until the 19th of this month. We hope that you will surrender yourself as soon as possible, even if you are ill. We are very eager for it. Tang Hao, Zhang Zhirang, together.</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Center Begins Accepting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization Federation, seeing that the weather is suddenly cold and the poor are pitifully cold and hungry, prepared the winter relief center held in previous years early, borrowing all the remaining houses of the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Railway Station. The sheds and internal layout have been completed yesterday and are scheduled to start accepting people today (the 15th) so that the poor can go to the center and have food and clothing to get through the cold winter. The funding for the center's supplies, with food, fuel, cotton clothing, and bedding as the main items, requires funds. In addition to the 2,000 yuan allocated by the municipal government, the donations pledged by various charity organizations are also allocated for application according to the number of the previous year. Those who have donated funds to the association in recent days include the Zhenwu Committee's Shanghai Office for 1,000 yuan, the Protecting the Country and Eliminating Disasters Dharma Assembly, China Merchants Electric Company, Mr. Yan Weilian, and Guangyitang each for 500 yuan, Inland Water Company and the Flour Exchange each for 300 yuan, and Ye Zicai's fundraising for Mr. Gong Fuxing for 100 yuan. The Zhenwu Committee's Shanghai Office has also donated 126 pieces of old clothing, 52 pieces of old shoes, hats, and socks, 30 old quilts, one old cotton batting, and four old single quilts. Mr. Zhu Jinyu's fundraising for Mr. Cao Lianxun has donated 500 sets of new cotton clothing, which is very enthusiastic. At this time of severe cold weather, we hope that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously.

<h3>Liu Dongbao Does Not Recognize His Birth Mother; Mother Angrily Attempts Suicide by Poisoning; Sent to Far Eastern Hospital for Treatment; Police Report the Incident for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yan Yueying, a woman from Suzhou, is currently 40 years old. Her home is at No. 486, Qipu Road. In her youth, she entered prostitution. She was appreciated by Liu Chengru, a wealthy businessman from Huzhou residing in Shanghai South, and was soon betrothed to him as a concubine. However, because the first wife was fierce, Liu and Yan lived in separate houses. Eventually, the affair was discovered by the first wife, who went to make a scene. Therefore, Liu and Yan moved to a villa in Qingdao and had a son, named Liu Dongbao. A few years ago, Liu Chengru passed away. Yan was forced to leave by the first wife. Dongbao was adopted by Liu's first wife. Now, Dongbao is grown up and has inherited Liu's estate, becoming wealthy. However, his birth mother, Yan, has not remarried since leaving, and has lived a hard life alone for many years. Her meager savings have been used up, and she is living a difficult life. She once asked her biological son, Dongbao, to confirm their mother-son relationship. However, Dongbao was limited by the conditions for inheriting Liu's property and refused. Therefore, the two have been involved in lawsuits in court twice, and Yan lost both times. However, Yan is still pursuing a supreme court appeal. She once went to Dongbao's home at No. 16, Donghai Road, to ask him to consider their mother-son relationship and provide alimony. Unexpectedly, Dongxian not only did not recognize her but also drove Yan out and cursed her. After returning home, Yan was overcome with grief and took poison in secret to end her life. Fortunately, the servant noticed and rushed her to the Far Eastern Hospital for treatment. After the hospital learned the reason for the poisoning, it immediately reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. Therefore, this case may give rise to legal issues.</p>

<h3>Changshu Guild Hall Asks for Relief: Illegally Pledged Public Property</h3>
<p>Dagon Society said that the public property of the Changshu Guild Hall in this city (previously reorganized from the Changzhao Rice Industry Guild Hall) was illegally pledged to the Pudong Bank and illegally auctioned. It was presented to the Municipal Party Department, Social Bureau, and Local Association President Du Yuesheng for relief. The original presentation reads: It is noted that our guild hall was established in the Guangxu period by merchants from Yumi Shipping. The money was collected to purchase land and build several houses at No. 31, Xinxin Street, outside Dadongmen. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, there was a dispute over property rights with merchants from Changshu inland. For the sake of determining ownership, Cao Zhenqing, former chairman of the Changshu Fellow Association, who has always been irrelevant to the guild hall, borrowed the name of the party department and deceived the ship merchants. He sent a letter to the custodian Zhang Chengxian and defrauded him of a land deed certificate. Xu Zaixiang came forward (it was found that the guild hall had no such person) and privately pledged it to Pudong Bank. After repeated negotiations, Cao Zhenqing claimed that it had been lost. When our guild hall reported to the Land Bureau to re-register, the bureau suddenly claimed that the land deed certificate had been taken care of by the Pudong Bank and could no longer be reported as lost. However, before accepting the pledge, Peabody Bank did not investigate with the guild hall whether the mortgage was with the guild hall's consent. This is illegal, one. According to the general practice of banks, all public property must be handled with care, and must never be accepted with private feelings or ignorance. According to government regulations, when public property is mortgaged and sold, it must be submitted to the competent authority for approval. Moreover, the land deed certificate was illegally pledged. This is illegal, two. The industry established by the funding of many people belongs to public property, while that established by the sole investment of individuals belongs to private property. Banks are not ignorant children, and do not understand human affairs. Now the bank forcibly recognizes the public property that has considerable relationship in history as Xu Zaixiang's private property and calls a deer a horse. The malpractices in this are confusing. This is illegal, three. In short, if this public property is mortgaged due to the economic difficulties of the organization itself, it deserves the crime. Even if it is auctioned, we will be willing to do so. Now it is bankrupt due to illegal pledging, so the accumulated sweat and blood of hundreds of ship merchants, the industry created by hardship, is ruined. People are ruthless, and ship merchants will inevitably feel regret and heartache. I respectfully think that you (Society) (Bureau) (President) (are the superior authorities for guiding and supervising people's organizations) (are local leaders). Please note that our guild hall has been difficult to build up, and grant relief at this time when it is about to be implicated and bankrupt. On the one hand, our guild hall will continue to appeal according to law, and look forward to the truth coming out and our property being returned. And we respectfully inform the wise people of the society not to easily take over and accept it before the property dispute is resolved. If it becomes a reality, our ship merchants will deal with it. I am about to present it in tears, and I cannot fully express my desire. Respectfully presented, the entire four hundred ship merchants of the Changshu Guild Hall in Shanghai kowtow together.</p>

<h3>Sentence for Illegally Carrying Opium Residue</h3>
<p>Five Months Imprisonment, Three Years Probation</p>
<p>Zhang Yinkui from Tongzhou was found carrying a bag of opium residue weighing 125 pounds at around 8:20 AM on the 6th of this month near the intersection of Tiantong Road and North Sichuan Road. He was stopped and apprehended by Chinese detective Tang Guangfu. Zhang claimed that he worked as a rickshaw puller at the Jizhitang Pharmacy at No. 236 North Shanxi Road and that the opium residue was purchased from a certain Jia at Sanguantang Lane, Huaji Road, at the direction of his boss, Li Bingchen, for use in making pills. Detective Tang went to the pharmacy to investigate, but the boss, Mr. Li, was not there, so he was taken to the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for detention.

<h3>Hengjiu Bank Sues Zhou Weishi for Not Settling 10,000 Yuan Mortgage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Case Was Studied Once, Resulting in a Continued Hearing with Witnesses</p>
<p>Zhou Weishi, a wealthy Suzhou merchant in his sixties who owns the famous Zhou Gengji Accounting Firm and resides at No. 379 Paofengting Road, was recently sued by Hengjiu Bank in the First Special District Court for failing to settle a 10,000 yuan mortgage. Yesterday, Judge Xu Fuji summoned him to the Fourth Civil Court. The lawyer representing Hengjiu Bank presented the case, stating that the defendant had mortgaged 10,000 yuan to the plaintiff under the name of Zhou Gengji for a term of six months. After repeated extensions, the term expired at the end of October of this year, but the defendant still failed to repay the debt, hence the lawsuit. The plaintiff requested a judgment ordering full repayment and interest at a rate of 8% per month until the date of enforcement, and also requested permission for provisional execution, as Zhou was on the verge of bankruptcy with debts of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Without provisional execution, it would be difficult to recover the debt. Zhou's lawyer argued that the defendant owed a total of 550,000 yuan to various creditors, who formed a group and appointed Ruichang Bank as their representative. The defendant entered into a trust agreement with Ruichang, using the land in Chun Geng Li as collateral. The agreement was certified by lawyer Huang Yiyan. One of the members of the plaintiff group broke away and filed a separate lawsuit, which was illegal and should be dismissed. The court summoned lawyer Huang to testify about the agreement. Judge Xu then announced that the hearing would be postponed for further examination with witnesses.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Province Implements a Hundred Industries Education Plan. Using Educational Methods to Improve the Skills of Workers in All Industries and Instill Basic Knowledge of Citizenship</h3>
<p>In view of the current decline in all industries and economic recession in Jiangxi Province, the province has launched education for all industries to improve the knowledge and skills of workers in all industries, increase work efficiency, and promote the prosperity of all industries and economic recovery. The province has formulated and promulgated the Outline of the Implementation Plan for Education in All Industries and the Organizational Regulations for the Committee for the Implementation of Education in All Industries. The current committee was officially established in the Department of Education on the 17th of this month. A meeting was held on the same day to decide on the principles and steps for the general establishment of remedial classes for all industries, to be implemented in stages. Currently, a white-collar survey is being actively conducted. It is estimated that there are a total of 8,224 factories, companies, and shops in the provincial capital, with a total of 34,455 male and female workers. It is planned to conduct training for workers in the leather-making, printing, rattanware, carpentry, clay work, porcelain painting, sewing, dyeing, hotel, knitting, soy sauce garden, woodenware, and southern goods and dried fruit industries in the early stage. Remedial classes will be established soon. Remedial classes for other industries are also being planned. The Outline of the Implementation Plan for Education in All Industries is attached below:</p>
<p>Outline of the Implementation Plan for Education in All Industries in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>(1) Significance: In view of the current decline in all industries and economic recession in this province, this province is using educational methods to improve the skills of workers (including shop assistants) in all industries and instill basic knowledge of citizenship, hence the name Education for All Industries. (2) Principles: I. To enable those who have jobs to be proficient in their profession and at the same time enjoy their work. II. To enable unemployed youth who have received vocational training to return to work. III. To use existing specialized talents and equipment to form classes for training. IV. To liaise with relevant agencies for division of labor and cooperation. (3) Supervision and Guidance Agencies: In addition to the Department of Education being the supervisory agency for education in all industries, the provincial government will convene the heads of relevant agencies, industry leaders, and people enthusiastic about education in all industries to organize the Jiangxi Provincial Committee for the Implementation of Education in All Industries (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to be responsible for investigation, design, and guidance matters. The organizational regulations will be determined separately. (4) Teaching Venues: A. Provincial vocational schools and mass education institutions, and provincial factories should all set up remedial classes for all industries. The subjects and types will be designated separately. B. Factories, companies, shops, etc., with 20 or more employees should set up remedial classes themselves in the factory, company, or shop. Those with fewer than 20 employees should jointly set up remedial classes with nearby businesses in the same industry, using the larger of the jointly established factories, companies, or shops, or the trade association as the teaching venue. However, factories, companies, shops, etc., whose employees have already entered remedial classes in item A do not need to set up or jointly set up remedial classes themselves. After the establishment of the first two types of remedial classes for one month, a form should be filled out and submitted to the Department of Education. The form will be determined separately. Those belonging to item B may request the Department of Education or the Committee to send personnel for guidance when they are established. (5) Curriculum: The curriculum of the remedial classes for all industries is divided into two categories: basic knowledge of citizenship and vocational guidance. The subjects are as follows: A. Those related to basic knowledge of citizenship: General meaning of the Three Principles of the People, Citizen's Guide, Current Affairs Lectures. B. Those related to vocational guidance: Service ethics, vocational knowledge (established according to the needs of each industry), vocational skills (emphasizing the transmission of technology and experience). In the above-mentioned teaching, the principle is that the time allocated to basic knowledge of citizenship accounts for one-third, and vocational guidance accounts for two-thirds. (6) Teachers: A. The teachers of the remedial classes for all industries are hired by the original establishment agency, or the Committee may be requested to select and send them. In addition to hiring from all parties, a teacher registration for all industries will be held. Any person who is confident in their skills in a certain industry and volunteers to be a teacher in the industry can register. The Committee will handle it. B. For those remedial classes for all industries that belong to handicraft guidance, the Committee will handle it jointly with the Handicraft Research Institute of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. (7) Expenses: A. Items: I. Teacher salaries are standardized at 50 cents to one yuan per hour. II. Material consumption is determined separately according to the nature of the subject. III. Office expenses are limited to necessary lighting, stationery, etc. B. Sources: I. Those affiliated with provincial vocational schools and mass education institutions, and provincial factories, the expenses are budgeted by the respective institutions, and submitted to the Department of Education for approval and paid from the provincial education funds. II. Factories, companies, and shops that set up remedial classes, the expenses are borne by the respective factories, companies, and shops (if they are jointly established by the same industry, the expenses are shared equally by the jointly established factories, companies, and shops based on the number of students), but subsidies may be granted from the provincial education funds. The subsidy standards will be determined separately. (8) Duration of Remedial Classes, Time, and Number of Hours: The duration of remedial classes is determined according to the nature of each industry, ranging from three months to six months. The number of remedial hours per week ranges from three hours to six hours, and the principle is to use spare time for remedial classes. (9) Certificate of Completion of Remedial Classes: After the completion of the remedial classes, a certificate of completion of the remedial classes will be issued after passing the examination by the Department of Education.

After verification, appropriate spiritual or material assistance will be provided. (11) Implementation Procedure: First, start with the workers in various industries in Nanchang City. All workers in various industries in this city must receive education. The order in which various industries hold remedial classes will be determined by the Department of Education, submitted to the provincial government for public announcement, and enforced. Once the city has achieved results, it will be extended to various counties and cities. (12) This Implementation Plan Outline shall be implemented after being approved by the Jiangxi Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Tian Bolie Returns to England by Ship, Publishes Letter to Chinese Historians (1) Welcoming China to the International Historical Society</h3>
<p>International Historical Society President Tian Bolie, at 8:30 yesterday morning, boarded the Changxing Company's "Queen of Asia" ship to Singapore, en route back to England. Representatives from various cultural organizations in this city, including Kang Xuanyi, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Hongfan, Chen Derong, Lei Guoneng, Li Enshao, and others, went to the port to see him off. Before his departure, Tian also published a letter to Chinese historians, which Kang Xuanyi translated into Chinese and published as follows: "At this critical time, I bid farewell to China, hoping that Chinese scholars will live up to their past reputation. It is especially important to remember that concentrated knowledge can have a great impact not only on the people and nation but also on the entire world. China should demonstrate its position in European and world academic conferences and achieve success through knowledge and scholarship. Previously, at the Beijing YMCA, I listened to a Chinese student English speech contest, which was very interesting. The mouths of these young people were full of nationalistic ideas. They spoke of the sorrows and humiliations of the country and its painful state in the international community, which made me sympathize with the enthusiasm of the youth and recall the era when Germany, a great European power, issued the same lament. Germany was then divided, ravaged, and suffering. The great poet Schiller said to Germany at that time, 'Only one thing can comfort you: though your land is ruled by others, Germany possesses the intellectual world and can still claim supreme status here.' I am neither a poet nor a politician, and as a member of an international organization, I feel it is inconvenient to freely express any preference for any nation or people. But one thing is certain: no country in the world has demonstrated as much in the world of thought and scholarship as China. She absorbs Western scholarship and enriches it with her own immortal traditions. There has been great progress in this regard. I am convinced that if China can adopt the right methods, it can be equal to any country on earth in terms of thought. Politics and war are dangerous games, and their results are often uncertain. The path to success through knowledge and scholarship, although difficult, is assured. China's lofty position in the world of knowledge, once chosen, can be established at any time. It is not enough for China to merely promote and absorb Western scholarship; it should also contribute its own renewed culture to the culture of every country in the world. Every nation should have its national and international aspects. Every nation has something to contribute to creating the honey of international life and achieving the great success of universal science. Every nation is related to the international community, and all who give or take from it will be blessed. I am not now talking about the world of politics, which is indeed encountering difficulties, as you all know. I am talking about the world of thought and knowledge and the world of scholarship, which are so closely related to the noblest traditions of your nation. At this moment, China can join international organizations, and other countries will not only recognize its past contributions but also benefit from its present contributions, and China will also benefit from them. Now, China goes to Europe and the United States to seek Western scholarship and then brings it back to China. But she has not yet fully participated in international academic organizations. Assuming that China has worked hard to save itself in terms of knowledge, it should not only express itself within China; it should not be confined to the Great Wall. It must show its position in European and world academic conferences. Can China do it then? I answer: yes, yes, it can definitely do it. In several knowledge organizations, China's position can be felt. First, Mr. Bonner, Chairman of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, came here several years ago and worked hard to establish a National Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. I know to this day that the association has been helpful to China, and China must know that there is nothing more to hope for from the association than stimulation and guidance. Moreover, on a level plane, it is very difficult to guide literature, art, and science by solitary power. I think in Europe, in fact, there must be a special international organization for each special discipline. (To be continued)"</p>

<h3>The Urgent Need to Rescue and Protect the Soldiers at the Suiyuan Front (Continued)</h3>
<p>— A Lecture by Dr. Pang Jingzhou, Recorded by Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>3.  Defense Against Poison Gas</p>
<p>The victory or defeat of modern warfare is determined by the quality of military equipment, which seems to be undeniable. But sometimes, it is not that simple and also depends on "heavenly timing," "geographical advantages," and "human harmony." As everyone knows, the most formidable weapon in modern warfare is the air force. The air force's authority can destroy enemy cities and poison countless soldiers and civilians within minutes. Any country that pays attention to national defense is actively preparing and hoping to increase the number of its air force every year. It is conceivable how authoritative the air force is in warfare. Many military strategists even say that the future insecurity of the world depends on the gift of the air force! We often hear these arguments in our ears, and we are constantly worrying about enemy air raids. The soldiers in Suiyuan are naturally very concerned as well.</p>
<p>Since the bloody battles to recapture Bailingmiao, we seem to have experienced that the enemy's aircraft have completely lost their control! Needless to say, this is because heavenly timing and geographical advantages are beneficial to us. We know that when the enemy launches an air raid, releasing poison gas requires the help of wind power. This so-called wind power must have a certain direction and not too strong intensity to achieve its purpose. However, Suiyuan is originally a desert, and the climate is extremely cold, often below minus 15 degrees Celsius. Sometimes, the temperature changes greatly in the morning and evening, so the wind direction is not only uncertain, but the gales are also uncontrollable. The poison gas released by the air raids is not only blown away into the unknown in the air but sometimes even poses a danger of being blown back into its own camp. The impact that the enemy's camp surface can receive is minimal! Therefore, the power of the enemy's poison gas is like a hero with no place to use his skills. At the same time, in Suiyuan, our country, there are few high mountains, only plains, yellow grass everywhere, and no one around. Looking into the night, it is as if the sky and earth are one color. The enemy's aircraft have also lost their explosive power. Even if the enemy's aircraft indiscriminately drop bombs, the chance of being bombed is very small, just like buying an aviation lottery ticket, where it is never certain to win. Because there are very few targets for aircraft to bomb in that area, we are lucky to have the advantage of geography.</p>
<p>Even more excitingly, the soldiers fighting on the front line are all fighting to win national glory, and death has long been put aside. However, we observed that there is still a small concern. Although the enemy's aircraft have lost their combat power, our soldiers cannot help but be somewhat defensive, which cannot be said to have reduced their fighting strength. Therefore, I believe that it is still necessary to be prepared for prevention. Those who support them in the rear should still actively donate anti-poison equipment and cold-weather supplies, such as gloves, cotton quilts, and vests, and transport them to the front to increase their necessary weapons for killing the enemy.</p>
<p>4.  Future Rescue and Protection Policies</p>
<p>The war in Suiyuan is a war for the survival of the Chinese nation. Then, the rescue and protection work should be jointly planned by talents with rescue and protection knowledge from the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, public organizations and the Red Cross Society in Shanghai, which are responsible for rescue and protection work, have the responsibility of contacting rescue talents and rescue organizations in various places and concentrating and distributing them. Beiping can also be regarded as the front line of China's national defense. There are many rescue talents in those places, and it is easy to supply the needs of the front line. Therefore, I still need to go to Beiping to discuss close contact. We believe that future rescue work is not a matter for one corner or one place and should be jointly undertaken by the whole country. What the front needs will determine the countermeasures to be announced to the people of the country. As for the detailed methods, due to time constraints, I will make a public report when there is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Finally, I remember that Mr. Yan Xishan and Mr. Fu Zuoyi both expressed to us after the recovery of Bailingmiao that they believed that future victory would depend on the four words "a grieving army will win." We must not be complacent because Bailingmiao has been recovered. We must also think about the future after the recovery of Bailingmiao, and there are still thorns. We must not underestimate the enemy and not brag about our achievements in order to recover other lost territories. These encouragements completely depend on the continuous encouragement and inspiration of the people in the rear, as well as the continuous provision of material assistance. Furthermore, do not think that we should only provide assistance when we win a battle and withdraw our hands when we lose. Victory and defeat are common in military affairs. The brave soldiers on the front line need the spiritual and material greatness given by the people in the rear.</p>
<p>Reporter's Postscript: Because Mr. Pang was suddenly urged to go to Beiping, there was no time to ask him to correct this article. The reporter is responsible for any recording errors.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Wartime Rescue and Protection Control (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>The national fortune is always in a very difficult time. The war in Suiyuan has become tense. The cold winter has arrived, and our soldiers are fighting bloody battles in the frontier. It is reported that the bandit army in Suiyuan has begun to use chemical weapons in its front. At a time when chemical poison gas is killing people, the rescue and protection of soldiers on the front line is an urgent matter. The war in Suiyuan has begun, and our army has occupied Bailingmiao. The fierce cruelty, the casualties, and the painful, dangerous, sad, and disabled conditions must be unbearable. Moreover, in this border area where medicine is backward, the transportation of large quantities of medicines, the collection of sanitary equipment, and the mobilization of rescue personnel are all urgent matters. In recent years, people in the country have studied various issues in response to very difficult times, but no one has proposed a discussion on the issue of rescue and treatment. This is truly regrettable. According to reports, the Chinese Male Nurses Improvement Association plans to unify the rescue lineup (see various newspapers in Beijing on November 20). Revolutionary elder Ms. He Xiangning has recently collected exhibitions of calligraphy and paintings by famous Party and state figures and will use the proceeds to organize a frontline rescue team. This is truly commendable. Prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai are organizing a more permanent rescue undertaking committee, and prominent figures from all walks of life are enthusiastically helping. These are all good phenomena. At this time, the government is planning to take control to avoid chaotic steps. The author takes the liberty of drafting this article based on his daily research experience for the reference of the people of the country, and hopes that wise men will not hesitate to correct it.</p>
<p>The main point of the establishment of a health agency by the state is to provide health care services to the people and prevent diseases on weekdays, so-called to seek the happiness of human society. If a national war breaks out, its responsibility is to rescue and treat the wounded and sick comrades in arms. Our patriotic soldiers work hard and serve the country on the battlefield, braving the frost and enduring hunger in the hail of bullets. Injuries and illnesses are inevitable. If there is no appropriate rescue agency to rescue and treat them, the country will reduce its combat capability due to injuries and illnesses, which is quite unfavorable to the war. If the rescue is effective, the wounded and sick can turn danger into safety and quickly return to the battlefield to protect the country. Therefore, the importance of wartime rescue agencies is not only directly related to the soldiers but also indirectly has a huge impact on the future of the country. In recent years, although the world's major powers have stepped up their military expansion, they have also planned for health facilities. The most obvious example is that Japan divides the national health administration into two types: one is "general health," which specializes in providing health care services to the people and is directly under the Ministry of the Interior; the other is "special health," which specializes in planning military health, so-called national defense health, and is directly under the management of the Army and Navy Ministries. When the author returned to China from Japan in August, he drafted an article introducing his observations on the country's health, which I believe the people of the country have seen in the Central Daily News's previous _ academic weekly. Another example is the Italian-Ethiopian War. At the beginning of the war, many Italian soldiers died of illness due to their inability to adapt to the climate and water of Ethiopia. Later, the Italian authorities realized this and sent medical experts to the front to study it, and also ordered male nurses to accompany the International Red Cross rescue team to work together. In the Italian-Ethiopian War, Italy won because of its good military equipment, but it must also be attributed to the country's health and effective rescue. At present, all countries are in this extraordinary period. Foreign enemies are invading, and the people of the country are fighting together. The war on the border has begun, and the recovery of lost territories is extremely urgent. We should plan ahead to prepare for the expansion of the war; otherwise, it will be difficult to cope with it. First, I will state the main points of the government's rescue control below.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the government should control wartime rescue. There are two principles for its control: one is the concentration of human resources, and the other is the concentration of financial resources. If there is no proper control on weekdays, there will be a shortage of supply and demand, a lack of measures, and the work will be chaotic and unsystematic, making command inconvenient. First, let's talk about the concentration of human resources.</p>
<p>A. Concentration of human resources... Human resources are very important in extraordinary times. At this time, the government should use its talents and strictly and systematically control the organized medical and health groups in order to facilitate command and benefit work. Therefore, a permanent national rescue undertaking committee should be organized in the capital to take overall consideration. The committee should also include social celebrities and those who are enthusiastic about social service to organize it together. The underdevelopment of medical education and health undertakings in our country in the past originated from the fact that the government and the people did not pay attention to health facilities, so the medical giants took the opportunity to manipulate and suppress them in the dark. The so-called sectarianism and exclusion of dissidents were everywhere. Therefore, there was a conflict between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and then there was the division between the British-American and German-Japanese factions. More recently, there has been a debate between doctors and nurses, and the infighting is a disgrace to our health and medical education. In the future, we sincerely hope that the people will urge the government to adjust it, and we hope that the highest health administrative authorities should be open and aboveboard and accommodate all kinds of talents in order to improve the undertaking. We must not repeat the same mistakes and take sectarianism as the main focus and factionalism as the basis, giving the people a bad impression. This is also a personnel problem in the control of rescue work. The concentration of talents can also be divided into two categories: organization and training. Organization is the driving force for promoting the undertaking. Without organization, there is no system, which can also be said to be no unity. If the internal organization is not sound, the progress of the undertaking will also be hindered. Try to observe the effect of our country's participation in the pre-money rescue in the past. What are the achievements? In a word, there is no effect at all. The author has also participated in frontline rescue work several times and has experienced it personally, so he also has considerable experience in this regard. The reason for the failure is that the government has no control over rescue. There is no overall plan. For example, various civil groups are enthusiastic about public welfare and organize rescue teams to participate in the front line. They lack training on weekdays and have no organization in the pre-money. This is the so-called rabble. Can they maintain it for a long time based on temporary feelings? Therefore, although the Red Cross flag can be seen on the front line, the work gradually falls into a state of idleness and slackness, and opinions often diverge due to personnel problems. This organization is not sound. The supply and transportation of medicines in the rear is not correct, and they are not in contact with the government. This training is not correct. What is the result? All efforts are wasted, and everyone is ridiculed. This war against the enemy is not a local problem. Is our approach to the rescue problem still developing in an abnormal state or should we ask the government to control it? The previous car can be a lesson, and it is not too late to make amends. Fortunately, the authorities have noticed it.</p>
<p>(1) Organization: In order to cope with the future and the current environment, our country should organize a permanent national anti-poison rescue undertaking committee in the capital as soon as possible, which will be led by the government. Its organization should be divided into a dual organization, that is, a general assembly should be established under the provinces, cities, and counties. If people are needed, they can be called together in a few minutes. If there is nothing to do on weekdays, they can do public health and prevention work. This work should be a committee system. In addition to the sanitation agencies and military authorities as ex officio members, experts should be hired to conduct research work. The committee should be divided into various departments, and its organization is as follows.</p>
<p>(1) General Affairs—Specially responsible for the management of documents, finance, general affairs, and matters of the subordinate departments.</p>
<p>(2) Organization—Specially responsible for expanding the association's affairs and the work of various groups and investigation and registration.</p>
<p>(3) Publicity—Specially responsible for writing, speeches, publishing, editing, and information matters. (4) Research—Specially responsible for researching various medical, anti-poison, and treatment matters, and discussing the association's direction.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Term "Tropical Diseases" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xiaozu</p>
<p>The term "tropical diseases" clearly takes geography as the standard, encompassing all diseases that occur in the tropics. Even world-wide diseases (Cosmopililical Diseases) that occur in tropical areas can be called tropical diseases. Conversely, diseases that are commonly seen in the tropics but occur in cold and temperate regions cannot be called tropical diseases based on the principles of logic. However, for the sake of convenience, people also call them tropical diseases! Let's take an example! For example, malaria is an important character in tropical medicine. However, it can also be found in the far north of Russia!</p>
<p>Good! Manson, in the preface to his famous book Manson's Tropical Diseases, clearly stated, "I take the term 'tropical diseases' as the name of this book, mostly for convenience without considering its accuracy!" The title which I have elected to give to this work, Tripical Diseases. is more convenient than accurate. This sentence came from the mouth of the contemporary authority on tropical medicine, and it can of course be used as a cited document!</p>
<p>In China, a country that is mostly temperate and less tropical, the history of the term tropical disease is not very long. The medical community's attention to it has only been a matter of decades. The general public's understanding of it may be limited to the gentlemen above the level of current common sense. This is a fact that is related to the progress of medical history, and it is also a recent imported product. It is not that I, a kid, dare to underestimate people! What's more, the so-called scientific Western medicine can only be said to be in its infancy in our country. This last-seeded and most naive medical product is, of course, still a stranger.</p>
<p>What deserves our attention and motivates me to move my fingers and pen is the resolution of the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education (I remember that this is a public agency name?). In this resolution, the subject of tropical diseases was listed as one of the compulsory subjects for medical students in the later period. It was once ordered to be followed by medical education institutions above the specialist level across the country, and special lectures were set up. (I only read about this in the newspapers. I don't know much about the truth.) This incident proves the position that tropical diseases occupy in medicine. Secondly, it is necessary to recognize tropical diseases in China. This bill has established the foundation for the future development of tropical diseases in China. The committee members' vision, detailed planning, and firm determination are truly admirable. Here, I offer a small tribute in the form of a nameless soldier's incense! But then again, I suddenly remembered a sage's saying: "If the name is correct, then the words will be smooth." All things need a name, forming the total mark of the static, dynamic, and meaning of all things themselves. If the name is not correct, then not only will the words not be smooth, but I am afraid that we will take the wrong path. In today's revolutionary trend, following the traditional concept of habit and calling diseases that also occur in cold and temperate regions tropical diseases, or at least listing them as tropical diseases, does not seem very reasonable! We need to carefully consider and correct it, and redistribute it. We cannot just follow others blindly and let it pass vaguely. In others, it is an established history and difficult to change. When we are just starting and want to rectify or transform it, it is a perfect opportunity!</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Three, Morning Glory, *Pharbitis Nil*, Chois.</p>
<p>(Plant) A common annual vine cultivated for ornamental purposes. The petioles are discarded, and the leaves are deeply lobed, with the central lobe elliptical, sharply pointed, entire, and the base expanded. Funnel-shaped flowers emerge from the axils, with the pedicels shorter than the petioles, bearing 1-3 flowers. The capsules are formed by three carpels, shaped spherically.</p>
<p>American Morning Glory, *P. hederacea*, Chois. The leaves are deeply lobed, with the central lobe ovate and the base expanded. The pedicels are short, bearing only one flower.</p>
<p>(Cultivation Method) For the purpose of harvesting seeds for medicinal use, make ridges 2 feet 5 inches wide. In May or June, sow 2-3 seeds every 1 foot 2 inches along the ridges. Allow the vines to creep along the ground. Around November, when the fruits are fully mature, uproot the entire plant and dry it. Then, strike the plants with a pole to separate the seeds, and winnow them in a sieve for selection. Each acre can yield about one *dou* of seeds, weighing approximately 18 *jin*.</p>
<p>(Medicine) Morning Glory Seed, *Semen Pharbitidis*, is obtained by collecting the seeds. There are two types: grayish-white and dark brownish-black. For medicinal use, the grayish-white type is preferred. They are wedge-shaped, 5 mm long, 3 mm wide, with a hard and brittle, wrinkled seed coat, containing a white embryo inside. The taste is mild, like oil.</p>
<p>(Components) The purgative component in the seeds is a resin glycoside called Pharbitin, present in an amount of about 2%. Pharbitinsaure is a glycoside formed by the combination of Methylpentose and glucose in B-Dioxymyristinsaure. The seeds also contain about 10% fatty oil.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) It is traditionally said that Morning Glory Seed is effective as a strong purgative. Due to its significant laxative effect, caution is required when using it. The dosage is 1-3 *fen*, taken internally as a powder.</p>
<p>Morning Glory Seed can be used as a substitute for Jalap root. Morning Glory Resin, prepared for this purpose, can also be used as a substitute for Jalap Resin. (Dosage: 0.5-0.7 *fen*.)</p>
<p>Method for preparing Morning Glory Resin: Finely crush Morning Glory Seed, soak it in warm alcohol, then distill off the alcohol from the soaking solution. Wash the remaining residue with water and dry the portion that floats on the water.</p>
<p>The British Pharmacopoeia includes the seeds of American Morning Glory, called Kaladna (Indian local name). It also includes Compound Kaladana Powder (*Pulvis Kaladanae Compositus*) and Kaladana Resin (*Kaladana Resina*).</p>
<p>Example prescription: Compound Kaladana Powder (British Formulary)</p>
<p>Morning Glory Seed 3.0, Cream of Tartar 6.0, Ginger Powder 1.0 - Daily dose 0.6-4.0 *fen*.</p>
<h3>Introducing a New Type of Medical Journal (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Indeed, the current situation in the medical field is almost unchanged from a few years ago; few of the medical publications available can escape the situation I described above, still suffering from being mediocre. Truly popular medical journals that cater to the public are rare, and those that genuinely provide colleagues in the medical field with reading material and serve as a source of intellectual nourishment for practicing physicians are even fewer. However, this new type of medical journal, currently edited by Dr. Yang, can be described as an unconventional and outstanding publication. It is not generally popular; on the contrary, it explicitly states that it is a specialized medical journal for medical professionals to consult. After examining its content, we can undoubtedly confirm that it truly lives up to its name as a specialized medical journal, suitable for general practitioners to read during their leisure time after seeing patients.</p>
<p>The content of this journal is entirely translated from various medical journals from different countries, making it a genuine introductory work. Another distinctive feature is that all of its topics and texts are mostly practical applications, with very little theoretical exploration. Precisely because of this, it is more suitable for general practicing physicians to consult and more beneficial for their practical use. Although medical theory is equally important as practice, and all practice relies on theoretical foundations, it is a fact that general medical texts often consume a large amount of space due to lengthy theoretical explanations. For general practitioners who are busy with their clinical duties, reading such texts is often uneconomical due to time constraints. This is exactly the real situation described in the editor's statement of purpose: "After reading each article, there is often a regret that it lacks practical use." The editor's resolute founding of this journal clearly demonstrates an understanding of this practical situation. He stepped forward to take on this "matchmaker-like" transportation work for the general practitioners who are busy with their clinical duties, so that individuals could browse various medical journals that emphasize theory but lack practical application in the midst of their busy clinical duties, which is uneconomical in terms of time and even practically impossible. However, they cannot afford to miss out on absorbing and consulting the latest medical knowledge that is constantly evolving. His dedication and spirit are truly admirable!</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is another noteworthy aspect in the editing of this journal: in its table of contents, almost all medical specialties are fully covered, including internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dermatology, venereology, urology, etc. Each specialty has several specialized articles. It almost covers all medical specialties. Clearly, the editor's intention is to provide general practitioners with access to various new medical knowledge and techniques from all aspects. Even specialists who specialize in one or two specific fields can find relevant materials to consult. This is indeed a characteristic feature of this journal.</p>
<p>As for its content, the articles are truly novel, and I deeply admire the editor's selection, and the translation is accurate and clear. If the editor can continue to maintain this spirit in the future, I believe that the journal can achieve the goal of making readers "benefit from each article they read" and "benefit from each issue they read."</p>
<p>As for the various highlights within, I cannot elaborate on them one by one due to space limitations. I urge readers to experience them directly for themselves.</p>
<p>After receiving this new type of medical journal, "Modern Diagnosis Translation Series," I felt a sense of relief, as if the editor had helped me repay a debt that I had been owing for several years.</p>
<p>Finally, I must add one more point: although the price of this journal is not excessively high, if the price could be reduced further to increase the popularity of subscriptions, the number of readers would certainly increase. With more subscribers and a wider readership, the effectiveness and development of this journal would become even greater and faster.</p>
<p>In addition to heavily recommending this valuable gift—"Modern Diagnosis Translation Series"—to readers in the medical field across the country, I also see boundless potential for the journal's future! (The End)</p>

<h3>Finance: Frenzied Gold Auction; Despite Unlimited Supply from a Certain Bank, It Briefly Broke the 70 Yuan Barrier; Daily Fluctuations Reached 14 Yuan; The End Result was a Rise of 5 Yuan and 4 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was stirred by the Xi'an Incident, which excited people's hearts. A certain bank initially dumped large quantities at the opening price, but to no avail, and the price briefly broke through the 70 yuan mark, before reversing. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw British prices flat and American prices stable. The forward silver price in Montreaux shrank by 5 hao and 1.5 li respectively. Exchange rate fluctuations were minimal. The price of London bullion rose by 0.5 pence. The Central Bank's official rate announcement showed both British and American prices flat. The Customs Gold Unit rose by 2 li. The standard auction gold price was posted at 1153 yuan and 4 jiao. People's hearts turned bullish due to the Xi'an Incident. Off-market preliminary trading opened with Hengyu, Lifeng, Hengchang, Yongfu Xing, Yongyu, and Xixiang all entering the market, causing the price to rise to 60 yuan. Dingkang and others supplied unlimited amounts of gold for settlement, causing the price to fall back to 57 or 58 yuan. However, due to varying buying interests, there was much struggle. The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, a certain bank continued to sell unlimited amounts at the limit price of 58 yuan, so although buyers surged, the situation could still be maintained. The HSBC official rate announcement showed both British and American prices shrinking, and the Silver Equalization Tax remained unchanged. At this time, there were repeated struggles. When, after 10 o'clock, those who initially advocated unlimited selling began to feel that they could not sustain it and withdrew, coupled with the extreme tightness of foreign exchange, the upward trend erupted, and the price even broke through the 70 yuan mark. Afterwards, the aforementioned bank still supplied gold from time to time, but because people's hearts were already bullish, short positions covered and long positions increased. After this, although the price fell, it repeatedly rebounded, struggling between 61 and 69 yuan from time to time. The after-market was still tight. Unexpectedly, the aforementioned bank continued to dump gold, so buyers became wary. However, because the domestic market was still tight, there were repeated struggles in the middle. Later, although rumors improved, the price once retreated to within 60 yuan, and many long positions took the opportunity to increase, easily rebounding. Indian silver rose by a total of 3 annas, but to no avail. In the end, the price remained outside the 60 yuan barrier. Now, the market conditions of the entire day are recorded below.</p>

But with the HSBC official rate announcement revealing that British prices were down 0.09375 and American prices were down 0.125, people's hearts remained bullish, coupled with the extreme softness of the exchange market, buyers surged. The announcement that the Silver Equalization Tax would not be changed was able to support the market for a while.

The January listed price was 1164 yuan, with morning replenishment at 1162 yuan. Refined gold was increased by 10 yuan, to 1168 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Unpredictable Fluctuations; Cotton Yarn is in Great Disarray</h3>
<p>Falling Violently and Rising Even More Violently, Rising Quickly and Falling Even Faster. The Result is: Yarn Rises by More Than 5 Yuan, Cotton Rises by About 1 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is rising and falling rapidly, the situation is extremely chaotic. This is because the Xi'an incident is serious, people's hearts are frightened and unsettled, and securities are plummeting. However, some speculators are becoming more active, so the market is rising and falling wildly. Actual transactions of existing yarn are also very lacking. Although 1400 bales have been traded this month, most of them are speculative in nature, lacking confidence in the future.</p>
<p>Market prices fluctuate greatly.</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market saw the December contract plummet by 5 yuan and 1 jiao and the January contract fall by 1 yuan and 9 jiao due to the seriousness of the Xi'an incident and the confusion of people's hearts. When auctioned to the February and March contracts, the market situation changed rapidly, the buying interest was strong, rumors arose, and buyers flocked in, soaring by 5 yuan and a half to 6 yuan and a half. The opening of the second auction saw the December contract soar by 12 yuan, to 260 yuan, January also jumped by 9 yuan, February was unchanged, and the March contract fell back by 0.5 jiao. By the third closing, those who made profits settled, and the price fell back slightly, the market was extremely chaotic. As a result of the standard yarn, each month rose by 4 yuan to 6 yuan and 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon was extended to open at 3 o'clock, the momentum was still tight. After the second auction, the price fell back as many long positions settled. By the closing, it had risen slightly again. As a result, the current month fell by 1 yuan and a half compared to the morning closing price, and the forward contract was stable. It was found that Jinchang sold 4200 bales, Changji 1100 bales, Hexing 1250 bales, Deda 1150 bales, Juxing 3600 bales, Yicheng 2500 bales, Taichang 1800 bales, Yichang 1600 bales, Changfeng 1550 bales, and Xiacheng 1700 bales. Yuda bought 1000 bales, Dafu 2800 bales, Hengyi 3600 bales, Mingde 2300 bales, Xingchang 1700 bales, Senkang 1950 bales, Shenji 5750 bales, Dachangcheng 6400 bales, Runkang 3700 bales, Dachang 2700 bales, Fukang 1250 bales, and Daji 1000 bales. The comparison of the market prices and the number of existing accounts for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Existing Yarn Rises by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Sales of existing yarn are still good. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 1420 bales for the day, the selling price rose by 5 yuan, and the price rose by 7 yuan. The buying amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<p>The cotton market was affected by the political situation. Another theory is that the price of cotton in other ports has risen sharply, and transportation on the Longhai Railway is blocked. Some oversensitive people say that there is a problem with the source of cotton, so the buying interest is even more intense, and the price of the distant month has risen by more than 5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Forward Cotton Market Closed at 2 PM</p>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market saw the forward yarn rebound, and rumors were rampant, all of which were bullish. The buying momentum was particularly strong, and each month jumped by 1 yuan and 3-4 jiao. After the second auction, it was still calm. By the third closing, a slight pullback was seen. As a result, each month rose by 1 yuan and 5 fen to 1 yuan and 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The auction closed at 2 PM. The market situation turned flat in the afternoon. Because the morning rise was too aggressive, it caused those who had made profits to settle, and there was a pullback. By the closing, it had recovered again. As a result, the current month fell by 6 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the distant contract fell by 0.1 jiao. It was found that Juxing sold 14,000 dan, Mingde 11,400 dan, Taichang 4,000 dan, Runkang 13,600 dan, Xiacheng 16,800 dan, Fukang 7,900 dan, Yikang 9,800 dan, Jifeng 5,800 dan, Zhenda 9,100 dan, Fuyuan 3,700 dan, and Yichang 3,700 dan.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Stopped Immediately After the First Auction. Brokers Requested a Market Halt, but It Was Not Permitted. The Downward Trend After the Opening Was Extraordinary.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's government bond market experienced a sudden and drastic change in the environment, with market prices falling sharply across the board. The market sentiment was also extremely chaotic. Panic filled the trading floor, with most long positions being liquidated and sold off. Under the shadow of rumors and alarm, the absorption of chips suddenly disappeared, and prices uniformly declined. Unified auctions were halted, which was unprecedented since the unified bond auctions began. During the morning opening, due to the serious deterioration of the situation, the Brokers Association convened a meeting of brokers, requesting the exchange board of directors and supervisors to halt the auction, but because the matter was unexpected, the auction resumed as usual after 10 o'clock. Then the situation became dangerous, the atmosphere was panicked, buyers suddenly disappeared, and market prices fell sharply across the board, exceeding 4 yuan, and trading was suspended. However, long positions were anxious to liquidate, and the price fell another 1-2 yuan in the dark market, with sellers surging. Therefore, the trend was decadent, a state rarely seen. By the afternoon, due to rumors of a turnaround, retail short positions began to cover, and the dark market rose slightly, equal to the suspended market price. However, the situation was still tight and volatile, and the bond market was still priced high, so it may be difficult to recover today. The 96 Government Bonds initially fell to 6 yuan due to panic, which was also the lowest price in the past two years. However, after the purchase by the 14th and retail investors, the price gradually rose in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th auctions, closing at around 7 yuan and a half. As a result, the overall drop was a sharp 3 yuan and 7.5 fen to 4 yuan and 5 fen, and 96 also fell by a small 1 yuan and 1.5 fen. The total transaction volume was 17,755,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil Suddenly Becomes Cautious</h3>
<p>Due to insufficient supply in the Han market, tung oil is currently most popular, and the market is gradually increasing. Last week, the selling price to foreign merchants was still at 48 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, gradually rising to 50 yuan. Last week, it rose from 50 yuan and 5 jiao to 51 yuan and then to 51 yuan and 5 jiao. Yesterday, although it was Sunday, there was no market, but the situation in the market was still very bullish. However, after hearing about the Xi'an Incident, it is feared that the political situation will affect finance and commerce, and there will be changes in the trend. Tung oil is related to foreign trade, and the domestic sales market is also related, so the market situation cannot be predicted. In Zhejiang, the past two days have still been doing Jiangjiao for 52 yuan per dan, while Hangzhou traders need 52 yuan and 7-8 jiao and 53 yuan to sell Shenjiao in this port. After receiving news of the political situation yesterday, buyers and sellers were not in contact, and it seemed to have entered a standstill.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Poor Silk Exports</h3>
<p>Reduced by 15,000 Bales in Six Months</p>
<p>According to the report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the silk exports in November were: 6,213 bales of white filature silk, 207 bales of yellow silk warp, 312 bales of yellow tussah silk, 176 bales of gray silk, and 195 bales of Shuangxi silk, totaling 7,476 bales. This is an increase of 3,154 bales compared to the 4,322 bales in October. However, the total number of exports since June of this year is 25,796 bales, which is still 14,957 bales less than the same period last year, indicating that the decline in Chinese silk exports is becoming more serious. The statistics for November are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Note: This year is from June of the 25th year of the Republic of China to May of the 27th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Last year is from June of the 24th year of the Republic of China to May of the 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Silk Market in Foreign Firms Still Lacks a Turning Point</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market only saw activity in Yokohama, where silk prices continued to decline, lacking vitality. Spot prices fell by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday, and futures fell by 16 yuan. The silk market in Shanghai foreign firms still shows no sign of a turnaround. User silk sales also felt minimal. Trading prices fell by a strong 5 yuan, with only 25 bales sold throughout the day. Sentiment in the silk market is quite depressed.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Large Increase in Transactions of Guangdong Coarse White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend was particularly tight due to the situation. The association set the price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods at 21 yuan 6.5 jiao, an increase of 1 jiao. Re-export goods were priced at 6 yuan 2 jiao, an increase of 8 fen. Eastern white sugar also rose. Spot No. 4 J mark was 21 yuan 6.5 jiao, up 8.5 jiao, and No. 8 N mark was 21 yuan 3 jiao, up 1.8 jiao, all with transactions. Re-export No. 4 was priced at 6 yuan 4 jiao, No. 8 at 6 yuan 2 jiao, No. 9 at 6 yuan, and spot at 21 yuan 1 jiao, all up 1 jiao from the previous day. This factory's cotton white Zhenji, Jinxin, Dahua, and other No. 1 goods were all 20 yuan 4 jiao. Among the numbered goods, Guangchao Long opened 50 bales of Xin Zhu Qing, with good quality and a price of 14 yuan. Hainan red was 118 bales, at 14 yuan 1 jiao, an increase of 1 jiao. This factory's No. 1 ice sugar was 25 yuan 4 jiao, and No. 2 was 25 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Joint Company: Yesterday was the due date for this first batch of bidding and exchange of Guangdong sugar, with a total quota of over 14,000 bags. Bids were as before. Shunde Factory's Wuyang coarse white was successfully traded at 6,716 bags, at 21 yuan 3 jiao. Shi Xin Factory was 1,820 bags, at 21 yuan 1 jiao. Shantou was another 175 bags, at 20 yuan 9 jiao, totaling 8,711 bags sold.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds from Hankou Clash with Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds have been quite tight in the Hankou market recently, so the assortments do not match Shanghai. For higher quality goods, the Hankou price requires 42-43 yuan. However, this market's trading prices are relatively flat due to weak sales. Hengzhou goods are around 43 yuan, and top-quality Xiangtan is 46-47 yuan. White lotus seeds are scarce both in terms of arrivals and inventory. Shanghai sells at 47 yuan, but transactions are also rare.</p>
<h3>Metals: Internal and External Transactions in Metals Suddenly Halt</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was detained by Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an, metal transactions in Shanghai have suddenly become bleak. Both domestic and foreign customers have stopped processing goods, and the industry has also cut off transactions for overseas orders. Therefore, the market situation yesterday was quite deserted. The foreign exchange rate in the market suddenly softened yesterday, so those in this business suffered losses. If the situation does not improve in the coming days, the future of the metal industry may not be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics: Camel Wool Sales Are Quite Good</h3>
<p>Among the domestic camel wool fabrics, those with tight fibers and a price of 1 yuan 1.2 jiao are being heavily purchased by Hankou merchants, who are using them for lining in large-brand clothing. This has led to a sudden improvement in the market. Long-haired camel wool, also known as "Kai Mo Tai Ke Si" (likely a transliteration), is currently quite popular. Many fashionable men's and women's custom-made coats use this material. Those priced around 10 yuan are almost all sold out, and except for a certain company, inventory is also low. Double-sided yellow camel wool is also selling very well, but the market is flooded with Japanese goods, keeping prices low.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Grain Market Created by the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Wheat has reached a high price unseen in decades. Flour prices are rising steadily, with forward prices all above 4 yuan 3 jiao. Red sorghum, corn, oil cakes, and sesame beans have all seen extraordinary increases. Only rice prices, except for thin paddy, have remained stagnant for passenger grade.</p>
<p>Flour Price 433</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw another major disturbance. Due to the reported increase in the price of foreign wheat, with Chicago up 0.3 jiao in the near term and 0.9 jiao in the long term, and Canada up 0.346 jiao. When prices opened, foreign wheat was reported to be up, and the sudden turmoil in Shaanxi led many to expect higher flour prices due to the unrest. Prices for the current month opened relatively flat, only up 0.2-0.3 jiao, while prices for January-February jumped by 0.7-0.8 jiao. However, prices for March-April suddenly jumped to the limit of 0.1 jiao. Public sentiment was agitated by the situation, adding a new factor to the market. By the afternoon opening, the current month and January were still within limits, but prices from February onwards all increased by 0.1 jiao. Therefore, although public sentiment was high, transactions became sluggish. Future developments will depend on the resolution of the situation.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Yesterday's Close Comparison</p>
<p>December 4.2950 4.1500 4.2800 Up 0.0575</p>
<p>January 4.2950 4.2500 4.2875 Up 0.0825</p>
<p>February 4.3100 4.2675 4.3100 Up 0.1000</p>
<p>March 4.3300 4.3000 4.3300 Up 0.1000</p>
<p>April 4.3300 4.3300 4.3300 Up 0.1000</p>
<p>Wheat Price 712</p>
<p>The opening of wheat futures also saw a uniform surge, for the same reasons as above, believing that it would have a significant impact on wheat sources. Therefore, after the opening, prices for all months rose sharply, with near-term prices up nearly 1 jiao and long-term prices up 1 jiao. By the afternoon opening, near-term prices stabilized due to the lack of actual shortages, but long-term prices became tighter due to the shrinking foreign exchange rate, leading to a larger increase. Prices for January to April increased by 0.12 to 0.19 jiao. The highest prices for March and April both reached 7 yuan 1.2 jiao. This record is truly unprecedented in decades. The current wheat market is also very tense. Factories are still actively purchasing, with Shandong wheat opening at 6 yuan 8.5 jiao, followed by 8 jiao and 7.5 jiao. Fuxin, Shenda, and Fufeng purchased 15,000 bags.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Yesterday's Close Comparison</p>
<p>December 6.81 6.78 6.79 Up 0.10</p>
<p>January 6.93 6.85 6.93 Up 0.13</p>
<p>February 7.06 6.96 7.07 Up 0.19</p>
<p>March 7.12 7.07 7.11 Up 0.15</p>
<p>April 7.12 7.06 7.12 Up 0.16</p>
<p>Oil Cakes Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday, standard soybean oil cakes changed hands, and outside buyers were even more active. Generally, people were still afraid of unexpected changes, so they were eager to buy. In addition, Dalian telegraph reported a price increase, and it was rumored that international demand for soybean oil had increased. As a result, the closing price of oil rose by about 0.5 to 0.7 jiao. Standard beans rose sharply by 0.11 to 0.15 jiao, and standard cakes also followed suit by 0.03 to 0.05 jiao.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Prices Even Higher</p>
<p>The soybean oil market situation is inseparable from the influence of Dalian's several sharp jumps. Due to insufficient supply in various producing areas and foreign firms' sales behaving like a whale swallowing the sea, new high prices are constantly emerging in the Dalian Exchange. The disturbances in this city and the current inland destinations of this city all have a need for winter preparations at the end of the year, and the market price is even more likely to rise sharply. Yesterday morning, sales were stagnant because the standard tended to be soft. After entering Dalian, the standard and spot goods sped forward rapidly, and as a result, they soared by 0.9 to 1 yuan. More than 900 pieces of various oils were traded. Peanut oil was also the same, rising horizontally by 0.3 to 0.4 jiao. It is estimated that 1,600 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>Various Grains Are All Expensive</p>
<p>The price of various grains in this city has been subject to a drastic rise in prices created by the world, and the momentum is quite strong. Red sorghum (i.e., sorghum seeds) has already opened at a price of 4 yuan 1 jiao. Green beans have all broken the 5 yuan mark. Corn requires 4 yuan 2.3 jiao, so the soybean market is even more turbulent. Yesterday, Tancheng beans in the market rose by another 0.1 jiao compared to last Saturday, with a price of 5 yuan 9.5 jiao, and 3,500 bags were purchased by oil extraction plants. Xinan Town beans were 800 bags. Although the current factory appetite is not smooth, the trend is tireless. The remaining various beans rose by 0.06-0.07 jiao. The destinations are this street's inland areas and Nanyang Gang, etc., inquiring about 3,000 bags of various beans. The sharp momentum of the sesame market has not stopped. Yesterday, Shashi sesame opened at 12 yuan, a full 0.7 jiao higher than the previous market. Other various sesames rose by 0.03-0.04 jiao. In the general market transactions, there were 1,200 bags of various sesames. Due to the lack of supply of pure goods from foreign firms, no business was done, and the overall trend is upward, certainly not below that of raw goods.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Alone Are Normal</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 110 boats of rice arrived in the South Market, totaling more than 23,000 stones of rice. Among them, more than 80 boats were thin paddy. The rain was drizzling, and sentiment turned positive. The local sales market was slightly better. The thin paddy bales initially stagnated but then moved, with about 10,000 bales sold, and the prices rose by 0.05 jiao. Middle-quality goods rose by 0.1 jiao. There were only sporadic transactions of thick japonica rice, and the market was stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were all similar. In the North Market, 24-25 boats arrived, but due to the cloudy and rainy weather, there were few transactions, and the market price did not rise or fall much. Passenger grade rice continues to be flat and weak. Because the source of the Yangtze River has been continuous recently, and the pace of consumption has decreased day by day, and more because of the changes in Shaanxi, Henan and Shaanxi have stopped business, there are still about 10,000 bags left. Yesterday's transactions were only about 4,000 bags. In addition to the oil merchants purchasing 2,261 bags of Hunan rice, this street also supplied Jiangxi and Wenzhou rice to about 2,000 bags. There were no other transactions. The Shanghai South Rice Market's sales are the best this year of thin paddy rice, so the market surpasses Zhabei, and because the wharf facilities are complete, transactions were still able to proceed as usual yesterday despite the rain, unlike the calmness of the North Market. However, money in the market was already tight yesterday, and the transaction today may not be as lively as in the past.</p>
<h3>Textiles: The Cloth Market is Also Extremely Chaotic; Factories Halt Sales of All Goods; Customers' Purchases Also Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was such that, with a major incident occurring in Xi'an, the market situation was also extremely chaotic. The morning market's opening price for yarn plummeted by five yuan, an unexpected development. Industry players were of divided opinions. Yihua Factory's 16-pound Five Blessings, Double Elephant, and 14-pound Single Deer Blue Chicken brands were the first to report a price drop of 1.2 jiao. Sales of lightweight coarse cloth continued as before, with a hundred-plus bales changing hands. The remaining goods also saw some small transactions, with sales prices remaining flat, as both buyers and sellers were indecisive and adopted a wait-and-see approach. Before long, the second round of yarn prices jumped up by twelve yuan, and factories immediately halted sales of all goods. Japanese trading houses stopped accepting customer orders from the Hakka consignment houses, causing existing consignment notes and spot goods to suddenly become sought after, with varying asking prices. In the afternoon, the benchmark yarn price gradually fell back down. Japanese trading houses slightly increased the price of fine cloth twill by about one jiao compared to last week's market price and resumed sales. The market situation calmed down slightly, with small transactions increasing by five fen to one jiao per bolt. However, for most goods on the market, factories were unwilling to quote prices, and customers were not determined to buy, causing trading to stagnate, it is said.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Chen Tiewu)</p>
<p>Since life is a pre-arranged role on the stage of the universe, in these extraordinary times, one should perform a few more acts of "Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition" and "Emperor Guangwu's Restoration."</p>
<p>"Shanbo Visits Friends" and "Meeting Across the Wall," such activities filled with romantic interest are indeed unavoidable in life. But with "humans as the cleaver and chopping board, and we as the fish and meat," and with even the stage on which we stand about to be destroyed, survival has become a major issue. How can you leisurely spend your days in the boudoir, living in "love"?</p>
<p>In the vast sea of people, there is no shortage of those who earnestly play the role of Yue Fei: but there are also many who put on painted faces and play the treacherous minister Qin Hui. Fame and infamy are most clearly written in the historian's pen.</p>
<p>The more brilliant the play, the more profound the impression left on the audience's minds. The more heroic and earth-shattering one's life, the deeper the faith one earns from others.</p>
<p>If you want to leave some traces on the short journey of life, you should perk up and perform this play of life.</p>
<h3>Early Winter Visit to Longhua</h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>It was a Sunday in early winter. I was walking alone, with light steps, onto Longhua Road.</p>
<p>In this season when the leaves have all fallen, wandering around Longhua, which is famous for its peach blossoms, seems rather pointless. However, I feel that springtime is the time when Longhua flourishes, a time of smugness and arrogance. Only in this season can you see Longhua's true face. I think that admiring a beauty with a thick layer of makeup between bright lights and green wine is not as good as admiring a village woman without makeup, perhaps then you can actually appreciate two or three parts of natural beauty. This is my motivation for taking a look at Longhua under the grip of the cold.</p>
<p>Step by step, I approached Longhua. Like small fists, the branches of the peach trees stood quietly in the orchards along the road. Although in the late spring season, I had seen these peach trees covered in brocade-like red flowers and green leaves, receiving praise from tourists, today I saw their true faces. Their gray-black and cracked bark was so haggard and devoid of life, just like a beauty in the early morning whose face is frighteningly pale. "Peach Blossom Blush," "Beauty's Skull," everything can be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>In the late spring season, Longhua Road is filled with silk robes and carriages, and horse-drawn carts flowing like water. But in this early winter, it is rare to see even one or two tourists. What can be seen along the way are not gentlemen in suits and ladies in high heels. The only things that decorate this lonely Longhua Road are farmers carrying hoes and loads, and peasant women sitting by the fences, mending clothes and breastfeeding. Besides these, there is nothing but the sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking, birds chirping and hawks calling, mixed with the sound of the Longhua Temple bell, forming a rustic chorus of nature. Although occasionally one or two streamlined cars speed past, they are only occasional, and in fact, not enough to disrupt the wisps of smoke rising from the groves, which weave together to form a beautiful landscape painting of early winter, a landscape painting full of medieval charm.</p>
<p>And so I think, in a few more days, white snow will flutter onto the earth, onto every peach tree, onto the ancient temple, onto the pagoda, and onto the surrounding bamboo fences and thatched huts. The entire Longhua will be completely immersed in silver-like white snow. Its lightly made-up and plainly dressed charm may be more worthy of longing than the expanse of bright red in March and April. But the people of Shanghai like to join in the fun. If anyone goes to Longhua on a snowy day, they will surely be laughed at as a madman. So you only hear people going to Longhua to see peach blossoms, not going to Longhua to appreciate the snow.</p>
<p>I have appreciated Longhua in early winter. But on my way home, I was constantly thinking in my stomach that in a while, when heaven tore down auspicious snow like white catkins, covering the entire Longhua, I must come here again and leave a few footprints, so that the villagers and monks would not be the only ones to fully enjoy the snow-covered scenery of Longhua.</p>
<h3>Changing Nests and Mating Luan Birds</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Vowing Loyalty with a Cup of Water, Lamenting in the Green Lamp's Dim Light; Promising Marriage with Golden Rings, Reporting Yearning Through the Red Affairs</p>
<p>Guoqi nodded and said, "Miss Li is repeating herself to clarify matters. It is right to be honest when making friends, and Miss Li's words are also correct." Youmei pursed her lips and smiled slightly, seemingly with a hint of shyness, raised her face slightly towards the ceiling, and asked, "What are your thoughts on this news, cousin? Oh! I spoke too quickly, and asked again. Hehe." Guoqi also smiled, put away his folding fan, tapped it lightly in his palm, putting on a very calm appearance, frowned and said, "It is always unfortunate when young ladies have such things happen. However, I wonder what kind of person Miss Wang's partner is? If they are well-matched, even if the marriage is not of her own volition, it won't be too bad." Youmei said, "Although I don't understand it very well, I heard that that person is studying in Shanghai, is very playful, and studying is just a façade." Cousin, think about it, a frivolous young man, how can that be good? As the old saying goes, a beautiful flower falls into the dung heap, I think Luo Lan will also become a flower fallen into the dung heap." Guoqi smiled and said, "That's too much." Youmei said, "Although I am being a bit harsh, I feel sorry for her and feel that it's more than just that." Guoqi sighed slightly. Youmei smiled and said, "I'm here to get a reply, cousin. Where is your reply?" Guoqi said, "With the little something I sent, there's no need to send a letter... " As he said this, his eyes looked at the desk. Youmei followed his gaze and smiled, "It's still the same small envelope." Guoqi's expression became serious, and he said, "Miss Li, although we don't see each other often, you must understand me. I am not the kind of person who harms others to benefit myself. Since Miss Jiang is already so distressed, if I send her something again, it would imply an advancement in our friendship. At the same time, if our friendship advances, but her marriage is not fulfilling, then I would not be comforting her, but adding to her distress." Youmei suddenly asked, "So, does cousin plan to end his friendship with her from now on?" The tone of her question was slightly raised, and her chest also slightly lifted, indicating a strengthening of her evidence. Guoqi's words were originally spoken very smoothly, in one breath. But at this moment, he suddenly became speechless, simply looking at Youmei, unable to say a word. Youmei said, "Not only that, since Luo Lan didn't avoid suspicion and sent cousin something very precious, why did cousin accept it so calmly and not return the favor?" Guoqi said, "I feel..." After these three words, he couldn't continue, just opened his folding fan and waved it very lightly in front of his chest. Youmei looked at him like that and smiled slightly again. Then she stood up and half-turned her body to look at him, and asked, "Cousin, can I take away this small envelope on your desk?" (110)</p>
<h3>Borrowing Longevity and Demanding Longevity</h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>It is a common practice to borrow longevity from deities. Although this is superstition, people do not regard it as wrong because it stems from filial piety or sincere foolishness. For example, if a father or mother is seriously ill, and the doctors have all given up, the son, having exhausted all human efforts and unable to turn the tide, is driven by filial piety to sincerely pray to the local Earth God, willing to shorten his own lifespan to extend his parent's. This is originally uncertain. Fortunately, if the father or mother is not destined to die, and their illness improves, then they see the acts of offering thanks to the gods with performances and presenting plaques as a matter of course; otherwise, it would be seen as sacrilege, not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>A certain person, Jia, was a devout believer in gods and Buddhas, and the villagers called him a kind person. That year, his mother fell ill, seriously ill, and both Chinese and Western doctors had given up. Jia was truly anxious, so he secretly prayed to the local Earth God—it is said that he even wrote a petition in the underworld—willing to shorten his lifespan by ten years to extend his mother's. Whether it was the deity's divine power or his mother's lifespan was not yet exhausted, her illness gradually improved day by day. Afterwards, the mother and son were naturally overjoyed and wanted to offer incense and present plaques to thank the divine realm. From then on, Jia was called a filial son by the neighbors and relatives, and Jia accepted it without shame!</p>
<p>This happened ten years ago. So, ten years later, how "filial" is this filial son? This filial son, due to marrying concubines, visiting prostitutes, and keeping mistresses, often demanded money from his mother. At first, he coaxed, then he demanded forcefully; if he didn't get his way, he would slam the table and scold, wishing he could punch his old mother to death and be done with it. One day, Jia had a bizarre idea and suddenly demanded that his mother repay the longevity debt. She said, "The ten years of longevity, I have already lived through, how can I repay you?" This filial son then showed her the method of repaying the longevity, saying to first prepare a petition in the underworld to petition the original Earth God, and then remove the plaque. Then the deities would naturally have a way.</p>
<p>To this day, Jia is still clamoring to "demand longevity, repay longevity," and it is unknown when this debt will be settled!</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Shanghai Support Suiyuan Movement</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The citizens of Shanghai have always been very enthusiastic in supporting and assisting in the self-defense of the survival of the nation and its people; this has been fully demonstrated in the Shanghai January 28th Resistance War and the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. At present, although foreign aggression is becoming more rampant, the patriotic sentiments of the people are becoming more and more intense. Just look at the recent Suiyuan alarm, the brave resistance of our frontline soldiers, and the enthusiastic assistance of the people in the rear, and you can get a powerful lesson!</p>
<p>Suiyuan is our most forward line of national defense, and at the same time, it is our last line of national defense; because if this line of defense is destroyed by the enemy, our country will no longer be able to protect itself. However, our determination to resist must start from this line of defense, because it is the last barrier in the Central Plains of our country after the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the occurrence of the Hebei-Chahar incident. This Suiyuan war, which is related to the final survival of the country, was finally unveiled by the multi-faceted military and opened the prelude to the war; and the exciting and bloody news, from the cold northwest wind, from the newspapers everywhere, came that the temple was recaptured, the bandit pseudo-counterattack failed, the bandit army revolted, the enemy bombed Wulanhua, and the climate in the frontier dropped to thirty-seven degrees below zero... and the patriotism and enthusiasm of the soldiers guarding the frontier to defend the territory were even stronger than in the past anti-Japanese situation. Therefore, since the war preparation was launched, the Suiyuan support movement and the comforting of the soldiers in North China and other places have risen like wind and clouds, and the response has been enthusiastic.</p>
<p>What is especially gratifying and exciting is that we read many moving news in the newspapers every day, such as: prisoners in various prisons going on hunger strikes to help with donations, peddlers and rickshaw pullers and beggars saving food and selling it to dedicate to the country, children saving their candy and toy money to support Suiyuan, and various groups and manufacturers in this city launching one-day movements, one-corner movements, one-yuan movements, and even one-article (manuscript fee) movements. The women's community is also publicizing donations and donating woolen shirts, cotton clothes, gloves, earmuffs, etc.... These, these, are all prevailing for a while. So far, just take the Suiyuan support donations in Shanghai, the total number has been more than one million, which shows the unprecedented enthusiastic mood, showing the true spirit of national self-salvation.</p>
<p>Every day, the newspaper tells us about the good news from the front line, and also reports to us the donation situation and the amount of donations from many groups, manufacturers, and institutions; in those donations, there are stingy coins from the pockets of the rich, sweat and blood money from peddlers, rickshaw pullers, and workers, and powder money from ladies and misses. The large numbers are thousands or tens of thousands, and the small numbers are a few cents. Moreover, these days, wherever you go, you can hear a series of conversations about the situation in Suiyuan and the Suiyuan support donations. This Suiyuan support movement can be said to be a general mobilization of men, women, old and young throughout the country. Although no slogans have been posted and no slogans have been shouted, the deep impression that can never be extinguished can be obtained in the agitated emotions of every people and in the excited conversations of every citizen!</p>
<p>Local Customs and Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Memories of Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Fantongshan</p>
<p>The motive for going south to inspect commerce was a year ago, because the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi have worked hard in construction in recent years and have achieved excellent results. The establishment of factories and industries has been increasing day by day, which has been praised by the people of the country, and the richness of the deposits is enough to provide economic researchers with excellent market data. This summer, my friend Mr. Deng Shixiong had a proposal to go to these two provinces for field investigation, so I partnered with him to travel together, agreed to take the Xingbu route to Annam and then to Hanoi, and then from Zhennanguan to Longzhou, passing through Liuzhou and Wuzhou to Guangdong Province. For a long-distance inspection, but due to time constraints, we delayed for two weeks in Xingbu, Annam, etc., and then went to Zhennanguan from Hanoi, took the Longzhou route to Yong, and took a car from Longzhou to Nanning, which took no more than four sentences and arrived at the destination. We arrived there on July 8th, when the province was in the period of resisting × and saving the country. The ground of Nanning changed into the most important area, the military deployment was tense, and those who came and went to the area were inspected. When we first arrived there, we were excited to hear the cry of resisting × and saving the country.</p>
<p>I remember one of the most bizarre things was that there were rickshaws in the Nanning market (Wuzhou has rickshaws but no public buses), but only public buses. When asked why, it was said to be Li Bai's policies, that is, humanitarianism and egalitarianism, so rickshaws were not allowed to be set up. Public buses are available on all roads, and it is very convenient to get in and out, and it is stipulated that a bus must pass each station within every ten minutes, so that passengers do not have to wait for a long time. At the same time, soldiers have separate military public buses, which are also scheduled to travel back and forth, with stations on each road. There is no fare for riding this bus, which is funded by the central government, so there are no soldiers coming and going in the civilian public buses, but the fares are also very cheap, much more economical than Shanghai.</p>
<p>The folk customs of Nanning are very simple and also pay attention to etiquette. The transactions in the shops are also very polite. The people, whether old or young, have to undergo military training and have a very brave spirit. The whole province is uniformly "armed". During the period of military alert, they can immediately be formed into militias. When the military emergency is lifted, they will immediately be demobilized and return to their old business. This is in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's legacy of turning soldiers into farmers, which is the three-self policy implemented by Bai Jian Sheng. As for the women, they also receive military training and are very simple. Most of them wear cloth clothes and rarely patronize cosmetics. The women who come out are all in their original faces, showing a natural beauty, without rouge and powder and that kind of enchanting weirdness. This is a new record for the women's world in China. Recently, many women have participated in the organized militias. Their work is mostly in rescue teams, and there are also many others, such as service to the political and cadre work of the military divisions and brigades. In summary, the spirit of the people can reach this level because of the ruling spirit of their rulers, which is the result of the people's support and obedience.</p>
<p>Since Guangxi implemented the new policy, it has erected the four major districts in the province, namely Wuzhou as the commercial office, Nanning as the political district, Liuzhou as the industrial district, and Guilin as the cultural district. When we arrived in Liuzhou, it was another new scene.</p>
<p>Wuzhou is the text center of commerce, the streets are prosperous, the architecture is magnificent, surrounded by mountains, and the streets are mostly built on mountain slopes. The river runs through, and the scenery is very beautiful. There is a provincial tung oil factory, a pharmaceutical factory, a tap water factory, and a sulphuric acid plant jointly run by Guangdong and Guangxi. We visited the whole city and various factories. The tung oil factory is more developed, and the pharmaceutical factory is divided into two departments: chemical and pharmaceutical. It was opened in January last year, and the order is well-organized and very spirited.</p>
<p>Guilin is surrounded by mountains, and along the Li River, there are many clear streams and dangerous ravines, which are eye-catching and never tire of seeing. The so-called Guilin landscape is the best in the world, which is not a false statement. We only had a few days in Guilin due to time constraints. Visiting the famous scenic spots and historical sites is like riding a horse to watch flowers. We only get a rough idea. Later, we visited several secondary schools, which were very strictly managed. The results are needless to say, of course very good. The students there all wear gray cloth military uniforms and walk with a heroic spirit. They all have a martial spirit and have been fully trained, symbolizing that they are the pillars of the new China and the pillars of the rejuvenation of the nation.</p>
<p>The administrative facilities in Guangxi are completely based on the "Guangxi Construction Program" passed by the joint meeting of the Party, government, and army last year. The Guangxi Construction Program has a total of twenty-seven articles, divided into four major principles: politics, economy, culture, and military. They are all practical guides, not empty propaganda. Speaking of their political construction, they have now improved the political grassroots, promoted various construction undertakings, and vigorously implemented and promoted a political style of fairness, integrity, and incorruptibility, improved administrative transportation, and implemented civil servant training. All of the above are evidenced by facts and there have been considerable political achievements that can be proven.</p>

<h3>The Xi'an Incident and Aid to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>While the battle in Suiyuan has only come to a temporary halt, and the enemy is preparing to force his puppets to stage a comeback, unfortunately, we have witnessed the extraordinary Xi'an Incident.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the Xi'an Incident, the National Government's decree on the 13th clearly stated to us: "The government has its own appropriate handling of this Xi'an Incident. All government affairs of all institutions inside and outside the capital will continue as usual according to the established policy. The people of the whole country should also live in peace and industry, and must not lightly believe rumors and disturb each other..." Naturally, we do not need to "disturb each other." But we cannot deny the impact caused by the Xi'an Incident, or the blow the Xi'an Incident has given to the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear.</p>
<p>Due to the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident, we can see in today's newspapers that several Suiyuan support groups have urgently issued statements deciding to "postpone the assembly." Although the urgent convocation does not immediately produce the strength to support Suiyuan, it is a fact that the strength to support Suiyuan has also been "postponed" due to the "postponement."</p>
<p>On the other hand, due to the domestic incident, the enemy will seize the opportunity to attack, which will also become an inevitable fact; on the one hand, we have reduced the strength of Suiyuan support, and on the other hand, we have intensified the enemy's pressure. May I ask, how will this situation develop?</p>
<p>If the enemy invades, the soldiers of Suiyuan will fight more bravely against the enemy, which we firmly believe. The Xi'an Incident has been dealt with "appropriately" by the officials of the National Government, and turning hostility into friendship is what we desire and believe. Therefore, although the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident may make our emotions momentarily confused, after rational consideration, we should work more steadfastly because of the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident. Being confused and shocked by the incident will not only not help to resolve the incident, but will also make the incident more chaotic.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, I dare to offer sincere advice to compatriots across the country: we must not be so frightened all day long because of the extraordinary domestic incident that we neglect to resist foreign enemies. On the contrary, precisely because of the coming of the incident, which will induce greater pressure from foreign enemies, we should concentrate our efforts to actively fight and fight for the survival of the endangered motherland!</p>
<p>Therefore, the Suiyuan support movement, if not absolutely necessary, we should not only not postpone the assembly, but also "advance the assembly"; we should not only support Suiyuan as usual, but also do our best to support Suiyuan!</p>
<p>We should use facts to proclaim to all countries: The Chinese people, even in the midst of extraordinary domestic incidents, still have the power to resist foreign aggression!</p>
<h3>Jinsha River</h3>
<p>— Hangu</p>
<p>The people who live alongside the Jinsha River are accustomed to the scenery of the river.</p>
<p>The dawn devours the darkness, and the crowing of chickens lingers on the treetops along the riverbank. The river is covered with a thin layer of mist, which weaves into a hazy net in the distance, blurring together with the distant mountains. The radiant morning glow paints the horizon, like pieces of tattered bright red carpets, like piles of delicate and enchanting peach petals, piercing through the white mist, reflecting on the mirror-like river water, imprinting pale red floating clouds, and swaying mountains, lush forests, and nodding willows on the banks. On the road along the river and in the forests, one or two whistles from horse herders and the clanging of donkey and mule bells are heard from time to time. In the mountain forests, woodcutters sing mountain songs, floating with innocent laughter. Gradually, the smoke from cooking by the riverside rises in wisps, and the sunlight gently kisses the river surface, making the Jinsha River more brilliant. It seems as if a peach blossom forest is blooming at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>On moonlit nights, the Jinsha River becomes thinner. The white moonlight reflects on the white water, and the river surface is vast, like a ten-mile plain. A gentle breeze stirs up ripples on the water, and wave-like patterns rise and fall in layers, like wheat waves. The mountains and forests at the bottom of the river sway like cradles. The barking of dogs in the riverside village, mixed with the howling of wolves on the mountain, echoes back from the high ground, making the moonlight and the Jinsha River even more desolate. Fishermen light torches, hold nets, wait for the fish baskets to fill with live fish, and return singing mountain songs. They will sell the fish tomorrow morning, buy a couple of catties of liquor, and drink until they are dazed.</p>
<p>When the autumn wind blows on the river surface, the Jinsha River puts on a turquoise jacket, and the sky printed at the bottom of the water is indistinguishable in color from the river water. The red trees on the mountain set off the green river water, making it more vibrant. The withered yellow willow leaves are blown into the river by the wind, drifting with the waves, and the large stones by the river gradually emerge. The water becomes clearer and shallower day by day. The women of the riverside village sit on large stones washing clothes until the sun inclines to the west before carrying their large bundles on their backs and returning in the setting sun, accompanied by the songs of the cowherds on the mountain.</p>
<p>If it is the season when willow catkins drift, the Jinsha River is plumper. Wildflowers dot the quietly standing mountains. Some unknown insects quietly crawl over the grass. Thrushes and turtle doves hop and jump in the forest, singing various tunes joyfully and loudly. Flocks of sheep leisurely stroll through the willow forests by the flower river, singing sad songs, innocently intoxicated by the flower-green nature, rendering the scenery on the river even more intoxicating.</p>
<p>The cuckoo bird cries out the heat in the forest, and the Jinsha River pants, like a pregnant woman about to give birth. Dark clouds gallop in the sky, a flash of lightning sweeps across the river surface, and a crack of thunder bursts, and heavy rain pours into the river. Then, the river, the mountains, and the valleys become a vast expanse of whiteness. But as soon as the sun comes out, the river changes its appearance again.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Shanghai Fish Farming Industrial School</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Dachang to visit the Shanghai Fish Farming Industrial School.</p>
<p>We got off the bus at Yuqing Bridge, asked many times, and finally found Yangshu Garden. As usual, we explained our intentions to the owner of the garden, and he sent someone to open the gate of the fish farm and guide us to visit.</p>
<p>The fish farm is opposite the garden, covering an area of about two mu. There is also a garden next to it, but it is still under planning and construction. The location of the fish pond was originally a branch of a small river. After they made some modifications and built a dam at one end to isolate it from the river, it became a long fish pond. The pond is not very deep. The deepest part of the water is no more than two zhang, and now it is only one zhang or so. There are currently five types of fish fry in the pond: white fish, grass carp, silver carp, common carp, and bighead carp. Among them, white fish are the most numerous, followed by grass carp. In terms of profit, bighead carp are the most profitable, and common carp are the least profitable, because bighead carp grow quickly and the feed is common. On average, they can be harvested and sold in eight months.</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of 1,500 fish fry in their pond, and each fish is about four or five taels, but it is still in the trial period, and all the equipment is very simple.</p>
<p>The location is very good. There is no shortage or excess of water, because there is a river next to the pond, a bay of green water, and several drooping willows. In the season of bright spring or long hot summer, I believe this scenery must be very lovely.</p>
<p>After visiting the fish pond, we returned to Yangshu Garden. The garden covers an area of about three mu, surrounded by fences built with boards. In the middle stands a Western-style building and a low-lying worker's house. Half of it is a horticultural garden and chicken farm, and the other half is being dug to prepare for raising American precious giant frogs.</p>
<p>After visiting all the places, the garden owner invited us to the reception room. At the same time, he told us that he was from Guangdong, because he himself was very interested in studying rural sideline occupations, especially he felt that fish farming is a cause that is worth promoting in our country.</p>
<p>One mu of fish pond can raise about 2,000 to 4,000 fish.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Each year, the fish is harvested once. The growth rate of the fish is that bighead carp can grow more than one catty per year, grass carp and white fish are about one catty, and common carp are only ten to eleven taels. The common feed is mostly aquatic plants and various soft-bodied animals. Each mu of pond costs about 100 to 200 yuan per year, and the harvest is also 200 to 400 yuan. According to this calculation, one mu of fish pond can yield about 100 to 200 yuan per year, and if ten mu of fish pond are managed, there can be a profit of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Fish ponds in lakeside areas are at least five mu or more, but the most afraid of those who manage fish ponds are floods and the intrusion of black fish into the pond, because these are the disasters of fish farmers.</p>
<p>It is said that all the fish fry in their pond were transported from Suzhou and other places, but it is not necessary to put crucian carp species in any pond, and there will be crucian carp in the future, because the reason is that crucian carp can rush in from the water or bring fish roe from the aquatic plants, and hatch in the pond.</p>
<p>The motive for the title "Fish Farming Industrial School" is to plan to give all comrades who are interested in the fish industry practical opportunities in the future, but it is currently still in preparation.</p>

<p>The entire play exposes the licentious and unrestrained ugliness of the warlord era in the 12th and 13th years of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The main character, Wang Quanhai, is a typical warlord. He was originally a bandit who was lucky enough to be reorganized and made a garrison commander. The villain gains power, and a rude fellow with no knowledge becomes mighty with a gun. Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, Qingdao... wherever he usually goes, there is an extremely luxurious palace and charming concubines.</p>
<p>Once, he was ordered by Master Xue to be stationed in Beijing for a long time. Therefore, before any important matters were handled, the most important first thing was, of course, to organize a mansion to get a new concubine...</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Sino-Western (1040) From 1 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Wang Shipeng Visiting the Prime Minister"</p>
<p>Ten years of hard work in a poor room. He became famous all over the world in one fell swoop. Yesterday, the Jade Forest banquet was bestowed by the emperor. Today, it is right and proper to visit the prime minister. The Tanhua and Bangyan (second and third place in the imperial exam) sent letters together. They bowed low and respectfully greeted each other in the drawing room. After a few words of greeting and tea, the prime minister urged the top scholar to stay. You are the best among the three hundred candidates. Your literary talent shines brightly like the stars. My little daughter is waiting to be betrothed. I would like to invite you to be my son-in-law. The top scholar left his seat and addressed the prime minister. The golden hairpin has already been matched to the right family. The wife who shared hardship cannot be abandoned. Friends in poverty should not be forgotten. Stopping the wife and remarrying disrupts the moral order. Honor and wealth cannot suppress an extraordinary man. Wealth and status cannot tempt an ambitious man. He refused the marriage, and the treacherous prime minister was furious. It was too absurd to leave without saying goodbye. Thinking, this boy is ignorant and speaks bluntly. No discussion, who will discuss it with you again? He was ordered to be transferred to Chaoyang.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Re-Releases "Chastity"</h3>
<p>Since the Nanjing Grand Theater honorably presented MGM's blockbuster "Chastity" last week, the audience has been as high as the tide every day, so that many people are unable to get tickets. The reason why this film is so embraced by audiences around the world is really because of the touching story, the famous actors, the magnificent scenery, and the successful director. This time, the Nanjing Grand Theater, in response to the enthusiastic demands of all walks of life, will re-release "Chastity" for three days after "La Dame aux Camélias."</p>
<h3>"Thunderstorm" Lead Actress Zhao Huaishen Comes to Shanghai to Film "Street Angel"</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhao Huaishen, the mainstay of the China Traveling Theater Troupe and the younger sister of writer Zhao Jingshen, is well-known in the drama world. When the plays "Thunderstorm" and "Resurrection" were performed in Peiping, Shanghai, and the two Hubei provinces, they were famous far and wide. Ms. Zhao's portrayal of a cold, gloomy, and somewhat morbid character in these two plays is particularly profound. Recently, Yuan Muzhi's new work "Street Angel" by the Star Film Company has a prostitute role, which is a character who has experienced many vicissitudes and tasted the sweetness and bitterness of life. It is quite suitable for the character played by Ms. Huaishen. Therefore, Yuan Muzhi consulted with Mr. Tang Kuichou and temporarily borrowed Ms. Zhao from the China Traveling Theater Troupe. The agreement has been finalized, and Ms. Zhao Huaishen set off from Hunan to Shanghai yesterday. After resting for a few days, she will soon begin living under the mercury lamp.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Interesting Facts About "Female Student"</h3>
<p>Chen Qixia, the lead actress of "Female Student," went to Baidai Company yesterday to record the new songs "Female Student" and "Spring Breeze Niaona" from "Female Student," accompanied by the Baidai Orchestra. The chapters were sonorous, and the singing was graceful, with very satisfactory results.</p>
<p>There is an early exercise scene in "Female Student." A practical shooting was held at China Middle School the other day. The male students were trained by a military instructor, and the female students did freehand exercises, directed by Teacher Shen. The movements were neat and the spirit was lively. The lead actors of the film, Chen Qixia and Tao Jin, also joined the performance, full of vigor, which made people yearn for it.</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng, who plays the blind old woman in "Female Student," and Liang Kaiyuan, who plays the blind old woman's young son, are an old pair of partners in "Mother." In "Female Student," the two play a mother and son who have suffered a lot, and their expressions are even more moving than in "Mother."</p>
<p>Leng Bo played a small rickshaw puller in "By the Huangpu River." Because he was careless in pushing the cart, he fell into the river from the bridge. Now, in "Female Student," he plays an old carpenter who also falls from the scaffolding because he lost his footing while building a house. He falls again and again, which can be described as a falling star shining brightly.</p>
