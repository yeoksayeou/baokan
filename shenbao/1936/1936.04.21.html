<h3>西半球國際聯盟計畫</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自德意日諸國恣意破壞國際條的舊大陸之集體安全已形存實亡歐亞二洲戰雲密佈日內瓦制度之失敗適與西半球諸國以刺激近者汎美洲和平會議正在積極籌備中熱心於新大陸和平者昌言西半球國際聯盟之組織此項計畫已由三多明各國提出得烏拉圭國之附議彼平素漠然於國際合作之美國亦有積極之表示據華盛頓方面消息美國所提之新大陸和平計畫要點凡四卽美洲各國關稅之休戰也以經濟制裁手段對付美洲之侵略國家也樹立常設之安全制度以保障美洲和平也及對於歐洲戰事一致採取中立政策也</p>
<p>第一項之關稅休戰爲赫爾國務卿之一貫政策第四項之對歐中立則爲美國傳統之外交方針惟經濟制度及常設安全制度爲美國平素所反對今華盛頓方面有此種表示其意義深長有足令人注意者</p>
<p>西半球諸國之所以有新的國際聯盟之要求者蓋深覺日內瓦之國際聯盟已不足維持世界之和平日內瓦制度自成立以來論者卽認爲歐洲一隅之組織而於亞洲美洲之事無積極參預之能力與决心美洲之事因盟的中承認門羅主義及美國之不加入國際聯盟實際上已離開國際聯盟之範圍亞洲之事自九一八以後英法諸國優容日本之侵略行爲實際上亦已非日內瓦之長鞭所能及意阿之戰爭起德國廢除凡爾賽及羅卡諾之呼聲化爲實際之行動日內瓦於歐洲本身之事且無力處置奚言亞洲與美洲故加入國聯之中南美各國有失望之感而年來華盛頓方面因赫爾國務卿之提倡睦鄰政策對於中南美各邦形式上表示誠懇之友誼其於古巴則廢除束縛古巴自由侵奪古巴主權之柏來脫修正案其於尼加拉加等國則撤回美國之軍隊其於哥侖比亞諸國則訂定互惠之關稅條的美國與拉丁美洲關係之改善誠赫爾外交之成功亦華盛頓戰勝日內瓦之主要原因也</p>
<p>至於美國之所以放棄其獨行獨斷之態度而願在經濟上政治上與拉丁美洲各國携手合作者其最大原因在於取得美洲市塲之全部而排除英法意德諸國勢力於新大陸以外過去金元外交已引起拉丁美洲諸國之反感排美賴債之事時有所聞夫以暴力相脅弱者必百端求反抗之途徑過去南美諸國之親英仇美良以美國之高壓政策使諸國在感情上受至大之刺激作用愈大反作用亦愈有力自世界經濟恐慌之潮襲擊美國美貨不得推銷於世界市塲歐洲亞洲均競築關稅壁壘故羅斯福總統一改過去之態度舍遠求近致力於改善中南美諸國之國交而增加美國南進之貿易數額然經濟之合　必以政治的和平爲條件新大陸秩序之安定爲美國利益之所在此華盛頓政府所以努力於西半球之集體和平之主因也</p>
<p>至於此種集體和平其程度何若其成效如何吾人尚不能加以判斷美國之目的在於經濟之互助拉丁美洲各國之目的則在於政治上之平等富强甲天下之美國果願與巴拿馬三多明各諸國爲伍在西半球之國際盟壇上同享票之權乎西半球小國林立除巴西智利阿根廷以外鮮有足稱者果</p>
<p>國有侵略之行爲諸國對美能作有效之制裁乎此種問題均不易解决故西半球國際聯盟視爲理想則可實現之期恐尚甚遼遠也</p>

<h3>穩定世界銀價　中美英商締協定　美官方無明確表示　銀價上騰投機所致</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間官方對於中美英三國將締結協定、穏定銀價及支持中國通貨之說、不願批評、據紐的商報今日所載社評、則謂中國銀行家陳光甫與財長毛根韜談話之後、或將有此建議、此間最有力方面表示、目前尚不致有此協定、至於銀價之上騰、則若干官塲認爲係投機活動、而非國際間之協議、投機家或預料有類此之協定、然此時適爲印度之結婚季、因之白銀需要旣大增、每年輒形上升、商報謂協定之宗旨、爲美國將以比較世界市塲稍高之價格購買中國之現銀、而中國則允許不以現銀在他處出售、如此卽可避免以後世界銀價之不定、英國則供給信用、擴大中國銀行之外匯來源、而穩定元價云、（二十日國民社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）此間金融界中人預料美財長摩甘索與游美中國銀行家關於貨幣之談判、可產生美國允收買中國白銀之結果、如是則美國可滿足其購銀案之需要、而出價較在他處爲低、同時中國有現金存於國外、則中國匯兌地位可較國內存銀更爲人所信任、泰晤士報評論中美談話、謂美國已向中國購得大宗白銀、刻在華盛頓之中國銀行家頗有代表南京當后談判一種協定之資格云、就今日現象觀之、執有白銀者準備出售、惟金融新聞則謂其意存觀望、冀恢復去年十二月間所遭之喪失、泰晤士報謂投機家去　已受損失、大爲失望、今猶擬作多頭活動，實可使人訝異云、倫敦人士現認銀市刻處於極危險之狀况中、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>反對皖省統制祁茶　洋莊茶業議决停兌　昨晨向市商會請願援助商會急電皖省採納意見竭力勸導展緩停兌期限</h3>
<p>上海洋莊茶業公會、反對皖省府統制運銷祁茶、置茶棧於絕地、經前日大會議决、今日起實行停兌、昨晨向市商會請願援助、市商會除勸導展緩停兌期限外、並急電皖省府採納茶業意見、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>茶業要求</p>
<p>洋莊茶業公會、為皖省府統制運銷祁茶、提出四項要求、　推銷組以各棧經理為主體、一切辦事員工、完全由各棧調用、　佣金仍照向例、抽取百分之二、　茶箱運至上海時、須立時將提單交推銷組、俾卽提茶出樣、以免貽誤市面機會、　凡與推銷有關之經濟事項、一律由本組直接辦理、曾推派代表孫子茀·卓華譜·卓鏡澄·等三人、赴皖向財政建設兩廳陳述意見、當經兩廳長完全容納、茶歸官運、由各棧組織推銷處、全歸棧方主辦、官不干涉、該代表等認為滿意、返滬報吿、並呈請皖省府批示、</p>
<p>議决停兌</p>
<p>該公會以　呈請皖省府批示執行、距今已六日、並無隻字覆到、而祁方皖省派委逼勒各茶號登記、且有轉領官欵者、旣領棧欵、復領官欵、轇轕不淸、且皖官廳曾對三代表稱說、事旣已妥恊、官不放欵乃不逾時而需食前言、剝削吾等權利無遺、各業為合法機關、有七八十年之歷史、張羅鉅欵、放與茶號、以遂什一之利、且自皖建廳在全經會提出運銷祁茶辦法、本會以其類於統制、電呈中央層峰及皖府、嗣接經委會復市商會轉來感電、僅原則通過、但須顧及茶商（卽茶棧）之失業及債務、並非統制祁茶、而皖府冬電、祇稱研討運銷非統制、不碎茶棧放欵、毋庸疑慮、各等因、是以進行向祁方放欵至百餘萬、今鉅欵放出、皖省府突行統制運銷、奪運奪銷、經手用金、不獨礙及茶棧、且吃盡茶棧脂膏、制茶棧死命、茶棧是售茶機關、已墊出血資之茶、而弗能經售、寃抑至此、呼籲無門、三代表於無可如何中、委曲求全、下下之策、今仍若此、全體茶棧、慄慄自危、今日統制祁茶、明日統制婺屯茶、平水茶、勢將同歸於盡、不得不為勉救血本計、從二十一日起、一律止兌各處所來到期匯票、未見票者、亦不簽字、聽候解决、如有同行私兌私簽、本會不認為會員、如茶號有欵存在茶棧、此另為一事、當然照兌、以昭公允、</p>

<h3>走私聲中　國糖滯銷影響航業　滬津運貨僅三之一各公司議運費收現</h3>
<p>在此北　走私日見擴大聲中、滬上航運亦受重大打擊各輪公司已在協商救濟辦法、亟將詳情分述如下、</p>
<p>國糖無法銷運</p>
<p>自廣東國糖暢運來滬後、因有免稅之特惠、照例可以暢銷全國、然實則適得其反、粤糖到滬雖多、而去路大阻、堆存貨棧、宛如山積、後來者已無儲存地、據經營國糖業之鄭澤南君言、粤糖銷路所受之打擊、其主要點卽在北洋之走私糖、僅僅北洋一隅、走私糖年達七百萬担、卽平均月有六十萬担以上、如當局不用有效制止之方策、則國糖已難望起色矣、</p>
<p>航業受大打擊</p>
<p>北洋航業、除冰河開凍時積阻之貨、曾經有一時期由各商輪趕裝、營業稍佳外、向例每當春季、各貨均發動採辦、航輪水脚亦可起色、詎今春情勢大異、近一月來、滬津兩地之來去貨、均退落至極度、僅及往年三分之一、故招商局减為兩船、勉强航行、三北公司計劃復航滬津、迄未派船、因無貨可運、無一次不虧耗、根本原因、端在走私貨暢售北方耳</p>
<p>减運費收現金</p>
<p>因此本埠各輪公司、特議定將所加之運津水脚、减去百分之四十、（原惟上海去貨極少、各公司刻議定從上海運津及他處、運費一律收現、不再記賬、同時天津航業界更以本年生意銳落、派繳之吳淞商船學校經費之噸稅、决計停付、已電請滬航商一致呈部請免云、</p>

<h3>上海英國學校概况（三）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>行政組織該校校務係由校務委員會主持。校務委員會有委員七人：其中四人係由雷司德遺產基金保管委員會推選；另有三人則由聖三一座堂推選。關於校產及基金保管等事項由校務委員會負責担任；其他校內一切訓練事項則委託校長全權處理。</p>
<p>該校學生人數不多，是以行政組織頗為簡單。校長負全校行政的責任；僅有書記一人從傍襄助。關於校中一切經費保管及收支事項，另由校務委員會委託湯生會計師代辦；此種辦法亦可减輕校長職務。全校敎職員每月舉行月會一决，報吿各級學生學業成績及討論督促學生學業的辦法。</p>
<p>經費收支情形　該校一九三四年度全年支出决算有十四萬二千餘元：內中敎職員薪金校工工資以及校長敎師輪流回國川資津貼的　十萬元；佔全部支出百分之七十。收入項下學費收入的計三萬七千餘元，佔全部收入百分之二十六；雷司德遺產基金收入及生息的計九萬四千餘兀，佔全部收入百分之六十六；其他工部局補助金及零星收入的計一萬一千元，佔全部收入百分之八。</p>
<p>學生學費數額各年級略有不同。預科第一，第二年學生每年付學費二百元；中學部初級第一，第二年及高級第一年學生每年付學費二百七十五元；高級第二年至第四年學生每年付學費三百三十元。書籍用品費每生每年付十五元；另有運動費每生每年付四元。學費及書籍用品費均係按月繳付，由家長直接繳付湯生會計師。該校對於兒童衆多家庭訂有减費辦法。一個家庭如有兩偭以上兒童進入該校肄業，第一個兒童付全費，第二第三個兒童每人即可减少五元。學生因病請假，如假日過長，家長可致函校務委員會，請求繳付半費。該校因學生人數頗少，而規模完備，開支浩繁，是以每生每年所耗之敎育費頗大。該校一九三四年支出决算為十四萬二千餘元，全年學生人數的計三百名，則每生每年所耗之敎育費平均的佔四百七十元，此數實屬不小！</p>
<p>四、「士君子訓練」</p>
<p>士君子（Gemleman）訓練是英國教育的一個特點。英國公立學校的理想就是養成守法的士君子。該校敎育當然也有同樣的理想。士君子訓練可從形式和實質兩方面來說明。在形式方面，所有學生必須穿戴規定帽衣帽，以資統一。該校規定學生衣帽的格式如下：灰色長褲或短褲，運動衣（校色），灰襪，學校領結，翻領襯衫司不打領結），灰襯衫，校帽。</p>
<p>校長敎師上課時亦穿學士衣以示表率。學生平時上課須遵守秩序，且須彬彬有禮。</p>

<h3>吐痰的哲學</h3>
<p>— 古人偉</p>
<p>不是我學了醫，神經過敏些，自小生長在一個鄉村裹，却早就養成一種不隨便吐痰的好習慣了。記得在很小的時候，便討厭人家的吐痰，甚至在傭人們搬菜搬飯的時候，總是不許他們講話的，怕他們嘴裹的吐液會噴到菜裹或飯裹去。爲了厭惡而發生注意，所以我處處都留意人家的吐痰的。前天在電車上，忽然看見（也是常見的）一位同胞把痰吐在車內的地板上，立刻又見對面坐着的一個洋人，翻白起他的綠眼，同時有一種鄙視的狀態，一種不易形容的洋式表情，流露在他的眉問眼角，那時我又羞又怒，却漲紅了臉，而那位吐痰的人反亳不介意，洋洋自得的樣子把頭向着窗外。這怎不呌外人到處輕視我們中國人呢？像這樣的事實，正不知多少。</p>
<p>近來衛生的運動，防癆的吶喊，也不知河日何時能得到良好的反饗，因為把向來為人提倡的「公德」來說，至今也沒有多少人能够注意到牠，不顧全公德的，他始終也不會顧全到公衆的衛生。往往也有許多明知故犯的事情，譬如明知鼻涕是骯髒的，偏要揩在公用的面巾上明知傷風是可以傳染的偏要在街頭巷尾滿貼「出賣重傷風」的廣告，雖然，主顧未必惠然肯來，但這種種都顯示我們國人的不重公德，一種移害於人的劣根性，在他們的心理上，以為把疾病傳染給人，自己的病就可以獲愈了，其實要曉得疾病的能够傳染的，傳染給人之後，自己的病非但不能减輕分亳有時反可加重起來，因為倘使你一個人生病，環境都是好的，也可帮助你病的全愈；大家都病了，環境變壞，你的病也只有越發增加起來了。所以破壤公衆衛生，卽是破壞個人衛生，損害公德，卽是損害私德，諺云「害人者，人恒害之」—同胞們，天網恢恢，不要作孽呀！</p>
<p>現在話說回頭，講到吐痰，痰是氣管裹的分泌物，生理上天然的作用要呌牠排出到外面來的時候，我們也母得故達的，最怕是有痰要吐吐不出，湧塞在肺腑裹，那才苦呢。所以有痰總得耍吐，因為假使絕對的「禁止吐痰」，你要把這口痰塞在喉頭，又不適意，含於口中，又何日是了，吞到肚裏，更不相宜，那麽只有一吐為快。不過吐痰自有吐痰的方法，自有吐痰的哲學業——並非我濫用文字，人家也有「吃飯哲學」的例子——你該怎樣吐痰，請看下列各條條：</p>
<p>因為痰可以傳帶疾病，所以吐痰最好隨時隨地都吐在自己的手巾上，不傷於人，不害於己。</p>
<p>手巾不備的時候，在家吐在痰盂裹，在外吐在有汚水流通的處所（如馬路邊上的陰溝）。</p>
<p>假使以上兩種都辦不到時，那只好吐在不常有人行走或居住的地方，和</p>
<p>不容易有灰塵飛揚的地方。</p>
<p>假使習慣一時不易改掉，就是要任意的亂吐，也得四顧有吾行人，免得吐到別人身上。</p>
<p>吐痰時勿用氣力，只耍用舌尖把痰送到口邊，上下的牙齒和兩曆一刮，痰便吐下了，因為用力時，痰沫噴散，會吹到別人的臉上，或附近的食物上，這再使入難堪沒有了，往往見人在霄車上，也很猛力的向窗口吐痰，於是吐沫的飛散，隨着窗外的風會像毛毛雨般的向着隣座的人迎而吹來，這多麼使人討厭！而且車外行人，有時也會被害，這是多麼不道德的一件事！還有雜貨店裏的夥友們，當他們門市爾條，生意淸淡的時候，便伏在櫃台上，很力的把痰吐到馬路邊上有時正巧行入走過，吐到人家身上，相罵相打也是常見的事實。聽說他們有意要用力吐得很遠的，吐得遠時，表示他的「元氣充足」，其實正是你的元氣大傷啊！朋友！善自珍重！趕快改去這種不好的習慣吧！</p>
<h3>變質性格與性格變質</h3>
<p>— 宗澤</p>
<p>—常人亦有性格變化的可能—</p>
<p>所謂變質，是指人類精神上的變化而言，從醫學的立塲說來，可分為二種，一是由於先天性的或精神病者的遺傳，一是在人類出世以後由於刺激和抑壓作用所造成而其症狀近乎像精神病者的一般，這一類人便稱之謂變質者，其大體可分為精神病素質者，傾向者，變性者三種，前者為最輕，决者較重，後者為最重。</p>
<p>所謂精神病物素質者，就是在康健的人往往亦有之，在遇到某一種機會（例如姙娠，精神過勞，月經，身體的疾患等塲合）卽呈現精神病者的傾向，所謂精神病的傾向者是指近似精神病患者在平素明顯地已呈病的症狀（如神經過敏，強迫觀念，恐怖症，衝動的動作等等）而尚未進入眞正的精神病的境地而言。所謂精神病的變性者，是指最切近於精神病者而其人的道德心非常惡劣，知能方面亦呈特別的不良者而言。</p>
<p>近世科學昌明，對於人的性格變質的原因，學者解釋不一，如前所述人的性格變質的原因，一是由於先天和遺傳的，一是由於刺激和抑壓作用造成的，但據最近精神分析學的學者，就人類意識以外一切無意識的行為加以精細研究的結果，亦有人吾認前者（先天遺傳）的一說，而認為人類性格的變質都屬於後天的。</p>
<p>這裏先把變質者的性格略舉一下，然後我們再說明其變質的原因。</p>
<p>凡與常人的性格不同而特異的，謂之變質性格，變質性格在此可以例舉的如自我心的頑強，多姿意的奇行，言行的不一致，喜怒無常，遇事非恐縮卽妄為，痴呆，喜處待動物，對人慘酷茍刻，對己則寬大自赦，知能發達的不平均，卽如對某一種技能有騖異超特的成續，而對其他方面就顯示特別的低等能等。自然，這種種的性格，並非绝對地只限　某一種人才會有的，卽使在尋常健康　人也多少會發現這種性格的存在，所錯者惟強弱之不同而巳。近代人大都趨向物質，人類內心的抑壓一天強似一天，精神生活由穩定而趨於相反的極端，因此非苦悶也卽是煩惱，內心的抑壓愈甚，精神上的刺激愈深，結果，卽是常人也極易陷於病的性格的變質。</p>
<p>我們人的精神概括地說來是由二個傾向所組成的，一是無限制的要求，一便是對踱的對這無限制要求的限制，福勞特把前者廣義地歸諸快感的追求，後者一概包抱在抑壓作用（現實的抑壓）裏面，而這種抑壓作用的開始，在人生出世以後，卽是從哺乳兒的授乳時起便有了快戚追求（口唇快感）的傾向，而這口唇快感的追求，大的繼續到一年以上，幼兒的興趣便漸漸的轉向排泄行為（肛門性感）上去，生後第二年的幼兒大抵對排泄行為甚戚興味而藉此度其自樂其樂的生活，再過了些時，在生後第三四年的幼兒，便對性器發生了趣味（幼兒自慰），或喜用目諦視（諦視慾）其性器，或喜以生殖器呈露（露出慾）於他人之前，而且在這個時期又喜虐待小動物（蟻蠅等類）藉着剝殺生物的行為（加虐性或Sndism）來發洩他的欲求，如是幼兒經過了一定的時期，直等到六七歲的時侯，這一種傾向就漸漸的藏匿起來，而繼之以起的卽是一種羞恥心，同情心，嘔吐感等等漸决趨向於道德的一方面來了，到這個時期，就是所謂潛伏期了。</p>
<p>如前所述，幼兒必在一定時的間內，度其追求快感的享樂生活，而在這個時期吾人若處置不得其法，就很容易構成幼兒精神上的變態，也就是變質者和精神神經病者的造成時期。</p>
<p>所請處置不得其法是怎樣的不得法呢？在這一點上還須加以說明。我們已知道入自出於母胎以後，其最初所表現慾望（本能）的形式，實由哺乳時開始，幼兒藉着哺乳時的口唇快感而度其享樂的生活，所以換言之，哺乳卽是幼兒的天國，而這樣的天國生活繼續到一年以上，孩子便達到了斷乳時期，斷乳以後的幼兒對他的親母往往有憎恨與嫌惡的傾向，且時時孕蓄着一種復　的心理而形成所謂幼兒倔強的性質，在這個時期為人之母者若不理解幼兒的心理對其倔強行為或予以苛責，或施以體罰，則幼兒必由憎恨而趨向恐怖，在不可避免的抑壓下，幼兒不得不把自己所心愛的東西放棄，而穉弱的深心中還時刻憧憬着恐怖的觀念，就在這種情形之下，極易造成幼兒性格的變質。不但如是，幼兒在極度的憎恨與恐怖以後，竟無法擺脫其所授的印象，卽如最喜吃乳的幼兒，在斷乳後於食物中發現了像乳一般的東西時，便立能催起幼兒的嘔吐感（歇斯的里性嘔吐</p>
<p>依據上述的理由，對幼兒性感方面的處置若用同一的形式來應付，則結果不消說是會造成幼兒對性器發生嫌惡的心理，也有竟達於成年期，還不能消散其頑毒的觀念，而所謂結婚恐怖症等的造成，實是種因於此。</p>
<p>由前述的情形所構成的性格的變質，我們若用適當的精神分析法（分析治療）去處置，也不難達到矯</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>正的目的。</p>
<p>人類精神的組織是非常複雜的，而所謂性格變質的原因當然也不祇以上所述的一端。挽近歐美各國對於早發性痴呆與幼若性神經症等都主張用預防的方法，因為這一種病的產生，對於整個民族的健全上有極大的影響，所以它實是個很嚴重的社會問題，但欲使這種病的不蔓延，一方面固然要用改良環境的一策來從事預防，而另外一方面還須籍着萬能的科學（醫學）來挽救那些可憐的已成病的一羣。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（八十五）眼瞼內翻症又眼瞼翻症</p>
<p>如前所述，幼兒必在一定的時</p>
<p>眼瞼是一個保護眼球的器官。主宰瞼裂開閉的機能。可使眼球前面濕潤。並能保持眼球的淸潔。驅除塵埃等物的侵入。主持開眼運動。則有上眼瞼舉肌。主持閉眼運動。則有眼輪匝肌。眼瞼中並有軟骨。稱為眼臉軟骨。是肉强刃的結締組織而成。牠的結膜。稱為眼瞼結膜。是一個最易患病的部位。就是可怕的沙眼。也是在此處發病。眼瞼的前緣。生有毳毛。是卽所謂睫毛。眼瞼的形狀。本係旣不內翻。而又不外翻。但是遇有病理關係的機會。便可發生這兩種的異常。茲將內翻及外翻的原因與種類。略述如左。</p>
<p>（甲）眼瞼內翻症　由牠的原因可別爲三。</p>
<p>瘢痕性內翻症——在沙眼（最多），結膜的腐蝕，及結膜的外傷等時。眼臉結膜常起瘢痕性收縮。以致發生內翻。</p>
<p>痙攣性內翻症—在角膜有泡疹或潰瘍的時候。每因眼輪匝肌的收縮而起本症。</p>
<p>皮膚性內翻症——在小兒下眼瞼皮下脂肪多的時候。或在老年人皮膚弛緩的時期。常可引起輕度的內翻。</p>
<p>眼瞼一旦內翻。睫毛卽行內轉。於是刺戟角膜。發生流淚及異物感覺。或竟釀成角膜混濁或潰瘍。</p>
<p>（乙）眼臉外翻症由牠的原因，可別為四。</p>
<p>瘢痕性外翻症——常眼瞼皮膚受有創傷，火傷，或眼窩緣骨疽等等的經過後。皮膚常起瘢痕性收縮。以致眼臉外翻。眼臉結膜亦卽向外曝露。於是惹起流淚，眼瞼濕疹，結膜發赤肥厚，，角膜混濁或潰瘍等等症候。</p>
<p>麻痺性外翻症—患顏面神經麻痺的時候。眼輸匝肌屢變弛緩。而起輕度的外翻。</p>
<p>結膜炎性外翻症——乃因結膜炎性肥厚而發。在有重沙眼的時候。常可遇見此種外翻。</p>
<p>老人性外翻——老年人的皮膚及肌肉大都無力而弛緩。此時常能引起輕度的眼瞼外翻。</p>
<p>眼驗無論內翻或外翻。須由專科醫師施行手術。方可回復原狀。吾則旣損美容。而又貽害角膜。切不可忽視啊。</p>
<h3>國產之藥物用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（植物）原產於熱帶，各地均可栽培，一年生蔓劃也。全株密布粗毛。葉互生，長柄，似心臟形，作掌狀五遣裂，裂片爲齒緣，頭銷鈍。雌雄同株。夏日由葉與莖間開五裂黃色之大合瓣花。漿果呈大小不同葫蘆形。</p>
<p>南瓜　C.moschata,　Duch.　var.　melonae　formis，　Makino漿果較前種爲大，作扁球形，有從溝，上下兩面爲凹形。</p>
<p>（生藥）南瓜仁Semen　Cucurbitae，係採集上列兩種植物之而成、本品爲扁橢圓形，長約１.５公分，尖端狹長。其IO個之重量，約相當於一公分、種皮呈淡黃色，頗薄，略帶軔性。中藏白色肥大之芽胎。味緩和，與油頭相似</p>
<p>（成分）種子約含有34％　之脂肪油，其主要成分則由Linlsaure，油酸Ｐlmitinsaure　Stearinsaure等之Glycerid而成。又含有Vrease.</p>
<p>果肉含有黃色素Carotin　及Adenin,　Asparagin,　Trigonellin　等之鹽基。</p>
<p>多食南瓜，皮膚往往轉成黃色，卽所備用柑皮症Carotinosis是也。蓋此種Carotin　在體內並不變化，與汗液同行排出，卽將皮膚角質層之脂肪染成黃色者也；但與康健無何等危害。若新陳代謝压盛時，則能迅速消失。多食蜜相，亦發生相同之症狀。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十九）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一三九問）　那種食物，對於牙齒的營養為最有價値？</p>
<p>答　富於鈣質（卽石灰　），憐質，丙種和丁種維他命的食品，如肉類，魚類，牛奶，蛋黃，水果，疏菜等，對於牙齒和骨骼，均很有益。</p>
<p>（第一四〇問）　那種食物，對於牙齒沒有什麽益處的？　　答　為炭水化物類食物，包括澱粉類，如米麥薯等，和糖類兩類。這兩類食物，或是兩類的混合製品，祇能供給身體的熱力和動力，極少增牛和修補細胞的力量，所以不能營養牙齒，而且這類食品富有粘性，常易粘附牙齒，易致蛀蝕。</p>
<p>（第一四一問）　飲食對於牙齒的影響，為什麽在兒童時代最為顯著？</p>
<p>答　兒童時代，為生長時期，一生牙齒建基於此，必需富有滋養料的食物，以助牙齒骨骼和肌肉的生長；吾則發育必受阻挫。斷乳後所食的仍應以獸奶為主，其他為輔。年紀漸長，其他雜品，可漸增加，如魚肉蛋水果蔬菜等均應多食。</p>
<p>（第一四二問）　我國兒童的食物，有什麽大缺點？　　答　我國兒童的食物多偏於炭水化物類方面。孩童到了斷乳後，所食的多係粥飯糕餅糖果等物，少食魚肉奶蛋等生長必需之物。就是到一二十歲生長還沒有完成的靑年，允其貧苦之家，食物也多是這樣偏重：熱力和動力的供給過多，生長資料的供給過少。結果，不但是牙齒和骨骼不能堅强，就是身體其他各部也不能充份發達。國人體力的弱，食物的不適宜，也許是一大原因。負敎育責任的人，對於學童飲食的不良，實在是應該去注意和改善。</p>
<p>（第一四三問）　補救國人飲食滋養的不足，有什麼裨益於牙齒的良好輔助食品？</p>
<p>答　我國社會中，富裕之家究少，貧苦之家居多，不要說很多人沒有食物營養的知識，就是知道魚肉牛奶等的滋補價値，也無力常時購辦。耍補救一般人飲食中滋養的不足，可以常常服用淸魚肝油，魚肝油的好處有三：　所含滋養料較任何他油為富，其中甲丁兩種維他命含量極多，對於牙齒和全身的榮養均很有益。　較他種油易消化，且能帮助燐鈣的吸收。　淸魚肝油的價極廉，四元左右可買一加侖，足供成入數月之需，每月所費不過一元。這樣價廉而又可靠之滋補品，實在最適於我國社會，可以普及一般民衆，其在兒童，允宜常年服用，以增加全身的榮養和牙齒的抵抗力，有些人因嫌淸魚肝油腥味不肯服用，其實耐心服一二週後，當不再感什麽困難，不必化多錢去買那魚肝油的製品，又內地鄕村兒童，無牛奶而又不易得魚肝油的，可多食蛋，蛋黃也和魚肝油一樣，很有益於牙齒的。</p>
<p>（第一四四問）　食物對於牙齒的益處，和食物消化的難易，有什麽關係？</p>
<p>答　難消化的食物，雖富於滋養料，也於牙齒無益，故食物須選易於消化的，但食物消化的難易，很難判別，而且因人而異，但若憑谷人的嗜好選擇，較為適當，卽適合胃口的食物，大都易於消化，若和口胃不合的，不應多食。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八七）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十三章　肺結核之預防</p>
<p>一提到本症預防，不免要連帶想到另一問題，就是：本症發生的原因究竟何在呢？這方面的答覆，當然是離不開結核桿菌的。但是我們耍曉得，每一種傳染病之成立，係必須有二種條件的；一為病原菌之存在，二為身體防禦力之缺乏，這二都是各有各的特點，缺一卽不為功的。所以單獨病原菌侵入人體，並不一定能構成病變；反過來說，身體防禦力雖缺乏，若無病原菌之存在，也是不能成立傳染的。舉個例來說，像肺炎症的肺炎重球菌，在尋常人們的喉部係時可見着的，如果一朝受了感冒，身體防禦力缺乏，纔可構成本症的。白喉症也是一樣。並不是口腔裏面一有了肺炎重球菌或白喉菌，就會馬上發生此二症的——肺結核症的情形，當然也不外此例。他的病原菌（結核菌）之侵襲人體，係在任何時間或空間都屬可能之列的；但結果並不是個個都構成本症。換句話說，就是：在全體人類裏面，總究還有一大部分人們，並非結核症患者；根據這一種事實，我們也可以看到人們身體防禦力之强弱一層，其關係是如何重大的了—</p>
<p>根據上述的原理，那末，對於本症之預防方針，係可分為兩方面出發的。第一為撲滅吾人社會上之病原菌；第二使人人養成一種卽使病原菌侵入體內，亦得以防禦之體質。前者係消極的，後者乃積極的。現在且先談第一種。</p>
<p>我們曉得，尋常急性傳染病之發生，大概總有他的流行蔓延之徑路的；如果就肺結核病人來說，此中首屈一指，最易為蔓延之媒介者，自不能不推患老們之「喀痰」了—這裏面所含的病菌數目，殊足驚人，據專家們精密統計，在重症患者一决喀出之痰量中，為數已近三億，如果合一晝夜排除之痰計之，則更須增加數十倍以上，這都足以向其他康健人們侵襲而蔓延無窮的。一個病者在短期中已經如此，遑論全體的病者呢—所以要想撲滅結核菌，第一應該處置病者的喀痰；復决，關於病人排泄的糞便，衣服，器具，書籍，住室，等種種，係無處沒有結核菌之存在，都應該用嚴密的滅菌手續方行；共間每一種方法情形，都放在後面再說。但或者有人一定要問：經過這樣嚴密滅菌手續，是不是結核菌會完全消滅？是不是本症蔓延之徑路會從此中絕？這是當然不成功的。尋常的急性傳染病像霍亂，鼠疫，或者屬諸可能之列：因為此等病症常限於一定之地方而蔓延，其傳染途徑，也比較係很明暸的。肺結核症則絕對不能相提並論。第一，結核菌因有脂狀或蠟狀物質之被覆，抵抗力很强，故極不容易死滅，就是他的最大敵人日光，也可以在射入時飛揚而起，而向他方蔓延的。第二結核菌並非僅存於本症患患者之體內，卽尋常健康者之體內，也是無處沒有的；痛快的說一句，就是：在人類任何之室內，絕對不能保瞪何處無結核菌之存在的—所以祗須一與人類相接觸，幾乎和接觸結核菌是一樣的；如果想避免結核菌之接觸，除非與人類完全絕交息游方可，這是誰也知道是辦不到的—那末，所謂滅絕社會上結核菌之不能成爲事實，當然是不言而可喻了！</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （寒）</p>
<p>曾記得日本室伏高信氏說：「婚姻的長歷史到什麼時候終止，不是今天所能預言的，但今天存在的婚姻的形式，終止期已經迫近，我想今天可以斷定它是十分精確的，」</p>
<p>大多數的人都說戀愛是黑暗的，卑陋的，其實照我看起來，戀愛却是光明的，因為沒有戀愛的人，如同秋天的枯樹一般，它盼望着春天的降臨。</p>
<p>阿拉伯人批評女性美的律例是：頭髮，眉毛，瞳孔，眉睫這四件要黑的，頭，頸，足裸，前臂這四件要圓的，皮膚，眼白，牙齒，腿，這四件要白的，舌頭，嘴唇，牙齦，面頰，這四件要紅的，黑圓，白，紅四件，都照以上的規定，才是眞正的美人兒。</p>
<p>戀愛這東西，不過是一個好聽的名詞，不是為了以濟的關係，就是為了解决性慾，老實講一句，眞正的戀愛能有幾人，所以吳稚睴老先生說得好：「堅决的說到男女之愛，純粹祇有性慾而已，」</p>
<p>「戀愛是人生的秘鑰，有了戀愛之後，才有人生，倘把戀愛抽了去，那末，人生有什麼意味呢？」這是日本北村透谷關於戀愛的評語，的確，這才是眞實的批評。</p>
<h3>帮忙</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>「帮忙」這個名詞，在中國的社會間可說是最普遍的了，尤其在上海人的口中，隨時隨地都可以聽到這種語調的，按照人類生存的原則上說，彼此本應當具有互助的精神，試思人生是這樣的擾攘，世事又是那樣的繁複，為公，為私，為人，為己，誰都處在紛亂的包圍中，就是所謂有閒階級，他也未嘗沒有他所幹的事，不過他所幹者，迺是追尋娛樂方面的，卽俗所謂「無事忙」吧了。</p>
<p>旣是人人多在忙着，誰又能帮誰呢？不過忙却有緩急之分，緩性的忙，儘可假以時日，從容辦理，但你若遇到短促的時間內，必須辦好一件重大的事項，而且因人手稀少，這便是急切的忙，在這時間，非法請你的至友，來帮忙一下不可。</p>
<p>其他帮忙的範圍亦很廣，比如有利於甲方，而無碍於乙方的事，但一經舉手，一提足之勞，便可達到目的，這種也稱為帮忙，吾人視能力所及，亦不容推諉的，獨有一種帮忙，最為困難，而且却占了帮忙聲中的大多數，便是向人「借錢」或「討債」，在錢未借到或債未討到的時候，你至少應向對方的人，懇請他帮帮忙，雖則對方肯容納你的要求與否，未可逆料，但你所處的地位關係，是不得不向他婉詞申請，這也許是小小的人生哲學吧。</p>
<h3>記太倉小普陀觀桃</h3>
<p>— 戴欲仁</p>
<p>南渡觀桃，為春日遊觀之樂事，余亦驅車往焉。自余家（滬西）循錫滬路至太倉南站，適有三十五英里，汽車一時許即達，自站依小道前進，沿途桃林遍處，綿互數百畝，留連紅雨叢中，已若置身桃花源裏，淺水灘邊，間或植李花數株，亦値盛　，滿樹皆白，點綴其間，亦復生色不少，行里許而至小普渡，錫滬公路特設臨時茶室數處，並於廟內設癢癢桃園菜社，余等乃午餐於此，嘗該地名菜膽鷄火麵筋，味殊鮮美；並購得土產糟汕肉鬆數事。廟奉觀音大士，而適在南渡，故名小普陀，前臨瀏河支流，隔岸桃林廣植，舊有石橋可通，惜毀於一二八之役，現尚未修造，乃乘舟而渡，陽光反映，流水為紅，輕舟容與，頗繞異趣。至對岸一付，流水環繞於千株桃柳之中，茅舍柴扉，村童三五，嘻笑自若，余等戲擬此處為弄陵舟子之舊遊地，乃相顧而笑，復自原渡而返，余等此行，由錫滬公路招待員陳霞庭君誠摯引導，復邀余等至城內汪園公園遊覽，使此行更增興趣，心感實深，傍晚歸來，爰為之記。</p>
<h3>蘇木路上</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>我們每次從故鄉洞庭出來，都是先趁小汽油船到木凟，在木凟搭蘇木班內河輪船抵胥門後再僱車至火車站的。這雖祇有那麼短的一條旅程，郤要更換三四回的舟車；要是沒有什麼行李，溜着一個兒身子的倒還猶可，但有時携帶了一點東西那就够麻煩了。况且从老家到汽船埠頭，從汽車縏埠頭到輪船碼頭，都有很遠的距離；那末，這其間只好將行李呌脚伕送，所以我每次的歸去，對於這段旅途郤非常的感到痛苦。</p>
<p>最近各處都在建設公路，以利交通，於是蘇木公路亦在去年完成了。那裏已由蘇福長途汽車公司正式通車，因此我這一次來回都是捨內可而走了公路的，雖則還沒有達到我理想中的一般便利，但較先前郤確實要省事得多了。</p>
<p>車行的經過是由蘇州火車站，經過閶門，胥門，西跨塘，至木凟，兼灣靈巖山下，票價從蘇州火車站到木凟原定三角五分，現在减收八折，並且行李是免費的。</p>
<p>我所乘的兩次，人心乎並不怎樣多，但因為由於發動機的馬力不够和道路的高低不平，使車身震撼得十分利害；我們坐在裏面，有點感到車子像要傾覆的樣子。人常常會被從座墊上拋起來的，肚裏的肺腸也給激得翻騰着，尤其是幾個有年紀的女太太們，眞是不堪其苦。</p>
<p>在車行的時候，聲音很大，差不多將耳臘都震得碎裂，腦子也給激得有戰脹痛起來。</p>
<p>我從這次乘車上，覺得蘇木公路學局在為交通謀便捷外，更需注意到乘客的安全，譬如那許多不完全的路應該從速趕築完竣，路上一些多餘的石子需要除去。不然這樣下去是會使一般旅客頭痛而害怕的。</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （狄秀之）</p>
<p>前閱本欄筆嘉君所記在四馬路及南京路一帶常常會碰到一個很遲鈍的中年人，老是拿着不普通的信封，逢人便問楊樹浦在什麼地方一則。作者亦曾遇見多次。為俗明瞭個中秘密起見，曾尾隨其人，至六馬路中央大戲院西首久泰烟紙店內，始將個中秘密，完全突破，爰誌之以告讀者。（以下為該中年人談話。）</p>
<p>「余（該中年人自稱）為北方人，（姓名不肯宣佈）現在黃河路，前在東北軍某師充任連長。九一八事變發生，曾身經數戰，以負傷送入後方醫院治療。滿擬傷愈出院，繼續為國家效勞，詎不久東北版圖易色，而余亦以傷在臀部，愈後已不能繼續馳驅疆場。家中尙有一妻兩子，兩子尙在稚齡，生活維艱，因之遂偕一妻兩子來滬謀生。惟滬上人地生疏，安有余挿足之地，不得已遂每日至各熱鬧馬路中，以間路至楊樹浦為由，偽作身體衰弱，不勝行路，急欲趁車趕路之狀，向路人乞取銅　數枚，以供一家數口之溫飽而已。」言已若不勝其感慨者，並出示其身上因戰事所受之創痕以示余，嗣在該烟紙店內買一信封，託該店夥友代為書就楊樹浦……路……號……先生收等字樣。其人蓋亦一可憐蟲也。</p>

<h3>上海物品助賑會之福果券</h3>
<p>— 南丁</p>
<p>去歲，各地江河泛濫，受其災害的災民，不下千百萬人，尤以蘇北各區，水災的重大，較甚於別區。到了今年，在此春令，正是耕耘的時期，受水災的災民，在去年經了急振和冬振，得以苟延殘喘，到了這時，不急作春振，使農民耕耘，今年的生活，必又困難至不堪設想，所以這時春振的重要，越重於急振和冬振，倘不籌振，竟要把以前的救災功德，全功盡棄，上海籌募各省水災義振會，因了這一點，對於春振的籌募，很是努力，恰巧蘇州有一位毀家助振的大善士姚老太太，將伊所有海紅坊花園洋房—平屋—基地—珠寶—價値六萬餘元的產業，完全捐做春振之用，因此便成立了物品助振會，發行一種福果券，一面再向各界徵求贈獎物品，一面戲募振欵，贈送福果券，辦理以來，成績斐然，現在把這造福於災民的福果券詳細情形，誌之於下。</p>
<p>福果券辦法—福果券的發行，這一次已為第二次，民十七年，曾發行過一次，民十七年，曾發行過一次，由王一亭主辦，額定二萬張，頭獎是三希堂希有珍品太版十三行眞跡。這一次與上次，略有不同，主席委員是現任國府振委會主席朱慶　氏，辦事處主任，是振委會委員成靜生氏，副主任袁委梅和金紹武，常務委員，有王一亭黃涵之等人，都是老於振務的名人，辦事毅力的偉大，自在意中。這次福果券的額數，共一萬二千張，凡是捐春振欵十元，便贈券一張，全數共十二萬元。最高的獎品便是姚老太太所捐的蘇州海紅坊花園洋房一宅，價値　萬元，二獎是　慕汾君所捐的通雲港良田五百六十畝，價値一萬八千元，其餘尙有汽車，平房，基地，珠寶，古玩，名人書畫，日常用品，等一切物件，每一張福果券，必能得到一種或幾種的贈品，所以捐振欵接受福果券的善士，「旣種福因，又得喜果」，實是一舉兩得的善事。</p>
<p>市商會徵募—本市市商會，因福果券是極重要振災工作，有關於災民的生死存亡，必須同心協力，使得到良好的結果。經物品助振會辦事處主任，成靜生氏，與市商會主席俞佐廷氏，顧問王曉籟氏，和徐寄　氏等的接洽，担任統一得募，由市商會去徵求贈獎物品，勸認振欵，接受福果券，所定的數額，福果券三千張，物品六千件。市商會的熱心振災，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>已認出券數—福果券共一萬二千張，捐振欵十元，即贈券一張，自經開始勸募以來，成績之佳，出人意料，已認出的券數，竟達一萬一千八百餘張，所存的只有一百餘張，所以五月一日的欲種福因而得善果的善士，要接受福果券，也得從速，不然，便要有向隅之憾了。認券最大的共有兩處，一處是江蘇省政府三千張，一處便是本市市商會三千張，其餘本埠交易所公會和交易所經紀人公會一千張，朱慶瀾在南京經勸一千張，宋哲元，蕭振瀛，劉鎭華，合一千五百張，成靜生三百張，王一亭二百張，以及熊秉三，郁葆青，朱少屏等，各認多張，此外杜月笙和張嘯林兩公，都慈善為懷，認勸不少，總數多已了一萬一千八百餘張，預料在短時間內，便可以全數認盡。</p>
<p>贈獎品一覽—福果券內須達到三六九等券有贈的目的，除了蘇州房地產，連雲港田產，珠寶之外，還不足支配，因此積極向各界徵求。現在除了市商會捐助的六千件外，已收到的有二千餘件，內中貴極的甚多。古玩方面有王鎭生君捐助的漢銅投壺，漢銅洗周製大圍屏，周製中挿屏，雕刻小挿屏，康熙雕瓷青龍香薰，乾隆琺瑯挿屏，靈壁石等八件。吳蘊齊的古磁花瓶。名人字畫，更不計其數，唐六如，費　樓，四王，成親王，米南宮，錢南園等都有。日常用品，熱水瓶玻璃杯，香烟等等，無一不全地，珠寶，將來券券有優良貴重的贈品，自無問題。這也是各界對於救災，非常熱心的效果，也是各界善士的功德無量，因這次災區災民，得到救濟，便可以耕種，生活得以解决了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲悵千秋</p>
<p>蓋聞相思難治，唯卜又棲。角酒不已，同歸一醉。故海枯石爛猶訂約於他生。花落鵑啼，徒遺悵於今日。</p>
<p>蓋聞慶父不除，終悲魯難。匈媽未滅，何以家為：</p>
<p>我正這樣的一首一首向下看着蘭厂却自言自語的說：花東鵑啼，徒遺恨於今日，兩個之中，必去了一個。這段事是很平凡的，只是在各自有我之後，還有樓上立盡黃昏，身不甘於泥絮，這倒是一頁奮鬥史。若是着眼在這裏把小說做下去，倒也是這過渡進代，少不得的一種文字。我說：那是當然的。我們要明白，這付託我作小說的人，是希望我們與他一種同情，自然也就要寫得讓讀者都同情起將手按住　了那詩　，笑說：我不願再念了、我若是再念，把書中故事，差不多全知道了，將來看你的小說，就沒有意思了。我笑說：你倒這樣感到興趣，你替這小說起一個名字罷。蘭厂說：名字嗎？你就在這二十四首聯珠上去找就是了。我聽說眞個把二十四首聯珠，捧到一邊，仔細　摸了一會。那最後一首，却有　巢　鳳，憶別泥　八個字。便拍着手說有了有了，就是換巢　鳳罷。有了這四個字，惜別泥雲，的意思已經在裏面了。蘭厂舉着茶碗喝茶，想了一想，點頭笑說：很可以，這就是不著一字，盡得風流。雖然有些古典，色彩，可是這四個字也還通俗。為求著含混出之起見這也妥。我說：不是如此。我們作書的人，總是和書裏的人同情的，在書名上表示了，我們的意見，或者為讀者所不滿。我們不如，就事說事，讓別人去世評罷。蘭厂說：那末，你對書裏人，是不加批評嗎？我笑說：</p>
<p>柳條伸出宮牆外，付與旁人道短長。</p>
<p>蘭厂似乎接受了我的意思，伸出手來和我握了一握。我們的話，到這裏為止，以下，就是書中人的話了。（一一）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>此身捨了往哪裏去？</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>以利斧殺死主人張德富張趙氏，纏訟三年，轟動故都的釣魚台長工王柱兒，終被最高法院判决死刑，於昨日由高等法院執行絞决。王柱兒在看守所中經佛敎會派員感化，他是已有覺悟了。所以當他被提出看守所，他請所丁將他的僧家裝束取了出來，把灰布僧衣和香黃僧鞋穿上，把佛珠套在頭上，然後手裏拿了一本金剛經，才跟着法警走上汽車，馳往刑塲去了，而刑塲絞機北面，也佈置了一尊佛像，旁有白布輓聯一付，上聯是「此身捨了往哪裹去？」下聯是：「求阿彌陀佛接引來，」那位王柱兒就面着佛像和輓聯不十分鐘捨了此身往極樂世界去了。</p>
<p>處决囚犯，通常是給他酒喝，使共在行刑時少受痛苦。有的神父也代為祈禱，使他上天堂，可是誰都不相信那廢話，原因非常簡單，中國人向來是相信天堂上只有「天老爺，」而無所謂「主」的，大多囚犯還是把兇烈的酒喝個昏醉而死去的，現在却「對症發藥，」施以佛敎感化，果然王柱兒當行刑前非但不怕死，在絞架上面着北方，他是看見他的極樂世界了。你看，他向佛像高聲誦經，並向之三叩首，卽端立受刑，面無憂色，那種大方的視死如歸，不是比神父祈禱，比給喝兇烈的酒効力大得多了嗎？</p>
<p>上海佛敎會有「保護動物會」組織的，原因是動物為有生命的，殺之未免太殘忍心，所以甚至勸人在走路時也該當心把螞蟻踏死。而現在把一個罪大惡極的囚犯施之以佛的感化，使他在行刑前不受痛苦，並送到「極樂世界，」那也是我佛的一番婆心呵—王柱兒捨了此身也不枉了。</p>
<h3>春荒</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>是春天了，可是。乾燥的北風還是軟洋洋的吹着，遠遠的靑山，草色是那麼淡淡的，沒有一點兒蓬勃的景色，就好像是閙過了可怕的災荒，樹林里的鳥語早就聽不到了，也許是害怕他們的性命完結在飢餓的人羣手里吧，也許是受了天然的巨創，悄悄地完結了自己的生命吧——</p>
<p>樹林的梢間還在吹着哨子，可是，已沒有那輕幽的葉片底歌聲，一望過去，完全是深秋的景色啦，那麽荒凉，那麽疲乏，從古舊的黃土層里透出來沉悶的香氣，跟着春天里的秋風輕輕地揚盪若，一切的，都已顯出了回復到原始的時代一樣的荒凉了，遼遠地展開着的平野，草原，田塲，河冲，都一樣地罩上了深秋的顏色。</p>
<p>村落里的人們都是現出了惶恐的氣色。</p>
<p>「千殺刀的天，今年又春荒了—一切都沒有收穫，田塲變了荒凉的地帶了。」</p>
<p>年輕的小三子，臉孔好像舊的黃土，淸瘦得一頭猴子似的，那深凹進去的死灰色的眼珠子瞪着。他已沒有勁兒了。但他還指着天，指着地，指着神靈，迸出了泡沫來的說着。然而，那對於他沒有一點用處，他挨了一個月飢，挨了一個月的寒冷，就好像生了一塲大病一樣，軟洋洋的不起勁，靠着牆，望着天空，又望着奄奄一息的，快要死的母親，她躺在床上，沒有了被頭，只有破壞了的棉絮和布片組合的東西，加上了那乾乾的黃稻草，當她聽到了兒子的怨憤底話，又睜開了那沒有光彩的眼睛，從陰暗的角落里看過去，只是一條蓬似的，她嘆了一口氣的。</p>
<p>「你不能怨駡天神呀—那是我們的命運不好！」</p>
<p>小三子好豫沒有聽到一樣，又望着家里的一切，一切都完了，牲畜連不肯殺的母鷄也吃完了，……想着，不禁嘆了一口氣，他想逃亡，可是還有母親，還有小妹妹，他怎能丟開她們呢？當他想到周家的兄弟和阿光他們一夥子，跟着長江下流一帶找生活去了，他的眼也紅了起來啦：「不過，聽說荒了好幾十縣呢，那兒不是一樣的死嗎？」</p>
<p>「兒子，小英那兒去呢？當心她跌落河里—那地方是很齷齪的（意思是有鬼怪，）兩天前，三個外村的孩子在那兒浸死了。」母親還是那麽吃力的說着·「你去找她來吧！」</p>
<p>「她自己會來的。那地方聽說有番芋！有好多孩子都到那兒去掘，也許，她會帶一點來的，樹葉，樹皮，你都不好吃呀！」</p>
<p>這個時侯，從外面奔來了一個十二三歲的女孩子，她的臉靑黃得那麽可怕，口張着，差點兒還要絆跌在階石上；氣喘喘地說不出一句話來。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「喂—發生了什麽事呀？」</p>
<p>小三子驚異地問，但是，他的身子還沒有動。</p>
<p>「我……我跟瓊姐一塊兒到河邊去，想掘取一兩塊番芋，呵!那是多麼可怕呀，我聽到瓊姐說：「這兒有鬼，兩天前迷失了三個孩子了，不知道那兒去呢？「可是，我們跑了不久，在那最陰暗的角落里，看見有三個人頭，呀！骨，……眞把我們嚇煞了。」</p>
<p>小央氣喘喘的說着，小三子張大了恐怖的眼珠子。</p>
<p>「我們馬上逃，拼了命的逃走着，我們還好像聽到有入在那里說：「女孩子的肉最好！」呀！我們的眼也昏迷了啦！」</p>
<p>小三子的臉痙攣着，嘆了一口氣，又望望小英的竹笠，，那兒有許多細嫩的草，連着泥土的根，還躺着五個小小的蛋，比鷄蛋還要小，比鳥蛋還要大，有許多斑紋和細點。小三子簡直快樂得跳起來的呌着：</p>
<p>「媽媽，妹妹拾了蛋回來啦，我燒給你吃，……</p>
<p>母親的臉有點兒笑容，在痙攣地說着：</p>
<p>「給小英吃吧！給小英吃吧！可憐她呀！」</p>
<p>晚上，小英和母親兩個都吃了蛋，小三子只吃過草根。可是不够兩刻。母親和小英中了那蛋的毒，痛苦地呻吟了一會就死了。</p>
<p>小三子悲哀地提着腦袋，拖着腿兒的跑出了村：</p>
<p>「我們走吧！在這兒等死嗎？」幾個靑年人又走上逃亡的路了。</p>
<h3>新聞</h3>
<p>— 馬</p>
<p>二先生兩天沒有上茶樓，那是希有的事，等於這茶樓上突然有個牛客降臨一樣地使人驚奇，茶堂阿九更是逢人便問：「二先生病了？」或「二先生出門了？「</p>
<p>這茶樓本來祗做着幾個稀有的主顧，都是本城有面子的人，他們有的是錢，祗要舒服，寫意，茶錢比普通茶樓貴上一倍多，他們是並不在乎的。每天吃過中餐，都像被什麼束西牽引着似的，穿着齊齊整整地上茶樓來了。各人都有固定的座位，有的自己帶茶壺茶葉來，一切都像在家裏一樣自由。茶堂阿九時常收集一點近城的新聞，信口開河博那些爺們的歡心。像某家的媳婦兒生得怎樣漂亮；某某的老婆偸漢子，爺們所以每天上茶樓來就是因為家裏聽不到那些風化的新聞。大家嘻呵哈的撩着天兒，日子很易容地打發過去。太陽一落山，就商議着今兒晚上的去處了，某邀某上他家去打牌，某某等上私娼牡丹家去，於是第二天茶樓上又有了談笑的資料。在茶樓上他們沒有一個是紳士。</p>
<p>但是二先生兩天沒有上茶樓却沒有一個人知道，因為他家裏人都不知道他上那兒去的，二先生的堂兄弟吿訴了他昨天去探訪的結果後，茶堂阿九彷彿一個祝由科似的跳了起來，「正是這回事了！」</p>
<p>他看見爺們都由他這句話張大了嘴巴的時侯，他故意裝了個鬼臉，彷彿城隍廟裏的小熱昏，一步步走到屋子的中央，打開他那張善於談笑的話匣子，</p>
<p>「二先生交桃花運了。上個月他上墳回來，不是說在北涇看見一個媳婦兒，怎樣模樣，怎樣漂亮，二先生要我探聽是誰家的老婆。」他拍了一下手掌，接着說：「正是這回事，他跑上北涇去了。」</p>
<p>這是個再好沒有的新聞，爺們有新聞聽，一巴肩胛把阿九拖扯着，彷彿一羣附羶的蒼蠅，把阿九圍在垓心，他們之間現在巳分不淸楚爺們和茶堂的階級了，拉呵扯的希望阿九把這新聞結尾演述出來。茶堂阿九旣是個胡扯新聞的好手，而且他懂得爺們的脾胃，在講新聞這件事上是祇有阿九賣關子的。他從容地打了個哈哈，橫開一雙生着毛的粗手攔住了最近身的兩位爺們，一個小學敎師講課那樣子說了：</p>
<p>「慢來，慢來！」阿九從耳根後搜出一截烟尾來，另一支手從衣袋里掏火柴的時候，有一枝燃着火的美麗烟捲從人叢中凑到他手上，阿九並不從那支手上去探索給烟的人，馬上把烟捲貼到嘴唇上，才講述這件爺們等候着的新聞：「二先生的脾氣我怎會不曉得，他是開口要，閉口到的，那天他吿訴我那媳婦的模樣兒後，我當夜到北涇去。哼，這眞是拿手戲，在北涇茶館裏沒有坐一盞茶，我打探得「明明白，」他鬥着眼珠瞟瞟一下爺們的臉「那雌頭（女人）是個寡婦呢。男的死了，家裏有瞎眼的婆婆，沒有穿，沒有吃，那是再好辦沒有了。你們看吧，」他用拇指食指打了個圈兒「二先生就喜歡這道兒，這兩天不趕上北涇上什麼地方去呢？他還要瞞着二太太呢！」</p>
<p>阿九歇了一口氣，馬上有四五張白嫩的手拍着阿九的肩頭，也有幾個彷彿看了一齣得意的戲，呌好起來。阿九故意再賣弄一下他的本領說：「這道兒的事，阿九沒有辦不了的！」</p>
<p>爺們一個個回到籐椅上去，他們用自己的經騐來猜想那寡婦的漂亮。二先生的堂兄弟好像又想到了一個什麽事突然站起來說：</p>
<p>「噲，我們今晚一同上二哥家去，說是二哥的我們去打牌的，看二嫂的模樣兒。」</p>
<p>這提議還沒有得到同意，一個小厮一頭野貓那樣子從樓梯上竄上來，阿九見是二先生家的小厮，學着一種草台班的腔詞唱了：「提起曹操，却曹操的家童到……」</p>
<p>衆人沒有笑出來，小厮氣急的冲着二先生的堂兄弟說：「三少爺快回家去，二少爺出門天，被人打傷了，北涇阿才今天用板門抬他回來的……」</p>
<p>阿九頓時張大了嘴巴，爺們的面孔轉了色，三少爺馬上尾着小厮下樓去了……</p>

<h3>「父子英雄」雜訉</h3>

<p>據王次龍報吿，一父子英雄」已完成十分之三</p>
<p>魏鶴齡飾一沉毅果敢之警察大隊長，因個性適合，演出成績極盡優美，對白音浪，允為淸晰明爽。</p>
<p>「父子英雄」全劇均是「力」的表演。</p>
<p>鄭孟霞初次上鏡頭，但表情之佳，動作之美，處處莫不現示其豐富的天才。</p>
<p>有幾千警匪爭鬥場面，因求迫眞起見，悉用眞槍，緊張之狀，實非筆墨所能形容。</p>
<p>故事多曲折，高潮多起伏，也是「父子英雄」的特點。</p>
<p>因着劇情關係，攝影也顯得恐怖萬分。</p>
<p>全劇中最緊張的部分，即是王引査探匪窟，地道機關的場面，佈景師包天鳴為增加戲劇力量，對此佈景特別重視，日來正專心打設圖樣，期能獲到佈景效果。</p>
<p>王乃東飾匪魁，據他自己說對此種角色較有興趣和把握，故其能有比前更優越之貢獻自無疑義。</p>

<h3>「迷途的羔羊」中的「老虎」與葛佐治</h3>
<h3>彩色片「松嶺恩仇記」</h3>
<p>爲電影界開一新紀元</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司最新出的「松嶺恩仇記」The　Trail　of　The　Loneseome　Plne　一片，聞巳定於星期三（二十二日）晚九時一刻起，在大光明大戲院獻映。這個片子，將在電影史上佔着很光榮的一頁，因為這是第一部完全戶外攝製的天然彩色影片，銀慕上的一景一物，和原來物體的色彩，毫無以異。單說那「日落」一幕，這是我們在銀幕上第一决看見眞正的日落景像，因為攝製普通影片的時候，受着空氣的條件所束縛，大都在日出的時候去攝取，因為黑白影片，對於日出日落看上去是沒有分別的，不過彩色片就不行了，因為日出的色彩和日落的色彩是不同的，彩色攝影機，這决在日落的時候攝取日落的景像，巳經獲得極大的成功。雪爾維薛耐是本片的主角，就已前的成績看起來，我們該相信這片子一定是値得一看的吧。</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>演員的保障（下）</p>
<p>可是中國的電影界是怎樣呢？這樣起碼的保障，似乎到現在還沒有，演員在水上淋過，能够喝一盃燒酒的，那似乎還是大明星纔有這樣的「殊遇」，至于臨時演員，或起碼脚色，則給你脫下濕淋淋的衣服，讓你在火爐旁邊煨一下火，那巳經是天樣的恩典了。至于從丈餘高的上面跌下，沒跌得爬不起來，那自然是你的運氣，要是跌痛了腰或跌傷了腿，就給你貼上一塊「傷膏」，至于送到醫院去，那是跌得「動彈不得」才有的事。</p>
<p>當然，跌傷了之後是吾痊愈，痊愈之後會不會復發，會不會成為終身的毛病，那是管不了許多的。</p>
<p>然而，一個演員在「為藝術而犧牲」的大招牌之下，在老闆們因掙錢而微笑之下，難道他所受到的待遇就此為止了嗎？</p>
<p>演員們，以及其他的電影從寧員們，你們的保障在那裏？</p>
<p>中國電影無論貧困到怎樣地步，演員仍這樣微薄的保障無論如何是應該讓他有的，而身為演員的電影從業員們，這樣微薄的保障也無論如何應該起來力爭的。</p>

<h3>Chiang in Chengdu: Individually Summons Various Generals, Gives Personal Instructions on Bandit Suppression Strategies, and Hosts a Banquet at the Provisional Headquarters; Chiang Attends Expanded Memorial Week Speech at Provincial Party Headquarters, Encouraging the People of Sichuan to Take on the Responsibility of National Revival</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) After attending the Memorial Week ceremony on the morning of the 20th, Chairman Chiang returned to the military academy's provisional headquarters to rest briefly. Starting at 4 PM, he separately summoned Guan Jiyu, Hu Shuhua, Li Houru, the heads of the central and China Agricultural Banks' Chengdu branches, Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Pan Wenhua, Tang Shizun, Wang Zuanxu, Li Jiayu, Sun Zhen, and others for individual talks. At 8 PM, he summoned Xue Yue, Wu Qiwai, Zhou Hunyuan, and others to give instructions on bandit suppression, and immediately hosted a banquet at the provisional headquarters. Gu Zhutong, He Guoguang, Xu Yuanquan, and others were also invited to attend the banquet. They all departed around 9 PM. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Chairman Chiang attended the expanded Memorial Week speech at the provincial party headquarters at 9 AM on the 20th. The main theme of his speech was the twelve articles of the party member code passed by the Fifth National Congress, encouraging the people of Sichuan to shoulder the responsibility of national revival. Chiang arrived from the provisional headquarters on time, first inspected the party headquarters for a week, then went to the auditorium to preside over the Memorial Week ceremony. Gu Zhutong, Wu Zhongxin, Qian Dajun, He Guoguang, Xu Yuanquan, Xue Yue, Liu Wenhui, Deng Hanxiang, Ren Hongjun, and more than a thousand leaders from all sectors of the party, government, military, and academia all attended the lecture. Chairman Chiang first stated that after being away from Sichuan for half a year, he deeply felt that all aspects of military affairs, government, society, especially education, had made very significant progress, which was extremely gratifying. Sichuan is a natural base for national revival, and completing the great cause of national revival is the responsibility of the people of Sichuan, and also the glory of the people of Sichuan. Sichuan is uniquely endowed by nature, and since Heaven has given happiness, it should shoulder extraordinary responsibility for the country and the nation, and not disappoint the era in which it was born, its parents, leaders, and descendants for thousands of generations. He continued by saying that in order to fulfill responsibility and achieve glory, one must have a correct foundation and goal, and the Three Principles of the People are the common goal of the whole country. In the past, in order to accomplish the Three Principles of the People, the purpose was to eliminate the Red bandits and remove national obstacles. The current slogan must go a step further: how can we save the country, how can we achieve twice the result with half the effort, and quickly save our country? If we want to know the principle of revival and prosperity, we must first understand the principle of past poverty, weakness, and chaos, and the crux of the matter lies in the decline of national morality, the lack of spirit, and the existence of only a shell. Therefore, only by promoting morality can we save the country from danger. Even without soldiers, guns, or cannons, people would never dare to bully us. Morality resides in the hearts of the people, and with just a change of mind, we can revive the nation. Chairman Chiang continued by saying that the most fundamental principles that we should follow in our lives are the twelve articles of the party member code passed by the Fifth National Congress. Not only should party members abide by them, but the entire country should abide by them. At this point, Chiang recited the code aloud and asked everyone to stand up to show respect: Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism; Filial piety is the foundation of family harmony; Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with people; Faithfulness and righteousness are the foundation of building a career; Peace is the foundation of living in the world; Etiquette is the foundation of managing affairs; Obedience is the foundation of responsibility; Diligence and frugality are the foundation of service; Honesty and cleanliness are the foundation of strengthening the body; Helping others is the foundation of happiness; Knowledge is the foundation of saving the world; Perseverance is the foundation of success. He also explained each article one by one, and elaborated repeatedly on helping others being the foundation of happiness, saying that selflessly helping others is the inherent virtue of the nation, and it is also the reason why China has so many people and such a long history. He also elaborated on the importance of perseverance in achieving success. The listeners were deeply moved. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) The remaining bandits led by Zhu and Xu are now entrenched in a corner of the Sichuan-Kang border, and their main force has been dispersed. Chairman Chiang has personally ordered the various armies in Sichuan to dispatch elite troops to jointly pursue and suppress them, with the aim of annihilating them in one fell swoop and eradicating them completely. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying is scheduled to meet with Nagami at the Zhang Garden residence at 8 AM on the 21st to exchange views on Hebei-Chahar diplomacy and anti-communism. Because Matsumuro will come to Tianjin within days to assist Nagami in discussing anti-communism matters with us, Song has postponed his return to Beiping. The two items of diplomacy and anti-communism will be handled by Xiao Zhenying and Chen Juesheng in place of Song for talks with Nagami and Matsumuro. Song will personally participate in the talks after opinions are consistent. The two matters of Hebei-Chahar diplomacy and anti-communism are proceeding simultaneously. The Japanese side emphasizes anti-communism, while we emphasize the cancellation of the Hebei-East organization. There is no change in Hebei-East diplomacy. The Japanese side has submitted methods to us and has received instructions from Tokyo via telegram. We will inquire about its final intentions after the talks with Nagami on the 20th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Nagami's return was delayed until noon on the 20th because troops returning to their home country were boarding a ship for export, and Song's scheduled meeting on the morning of the 20th did not take place. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Meicun, chief of staff of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and Feng Zhian, commander of the 37th Division, were summoned to Tianjin by Song on the evening of the 20th to discuss anti-communism matters in southern Hebei. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, after returning to Tianjin, Nagami will immediately convene a conference of Japanese military officials from various parts of North China to instruct the Japanese government's diplomatic policy and study everything. The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue must be discussed after the meeting. The location is undecided in either Beiping or Tianjin. It is reported that the Japanese side already has a fixed proposal on the Hebei-East issue. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Responsible authorities in Hebei and Chahar stated that the solution to the Hebei-East issue brought back by Nagami is relatively moderate, and there is a possibility of rapprochement between the two sides. However, the key still lies in the anti-communism issue, but the focus of each side is different. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the diplomatic situation in North China, generally speaking, is still relatively calm and stable at present, and there is no particular tension. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military部 dispatched Major Takahashi, wearing Chinese clothing, to explore Outer Mongolia. The Japanese side in Tianjin gave him a special send-off on the 20th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to well-informed sources, Colonel Nagami, the chief of staff of the Japanese Garrison Army 駐屯軍, will be reassigned and carries a plan from the military部 to solve various problems in North China.

It is expected that the long-delayed Sino-Japanese negotiations in North China will have a new development in the near future. (20th Chinese United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan did not leave Tianjin on the 20th due to matters, and will have to postpone his trip to Beiping for a few days. After Nagami returns to Tianjin, he is scheduled to meet with Xiao Zhenying on the 21st to start discussions on various issues. The abolition of the Hebei-East puppet organization is one of them. It is reported that the two sides can hope for rapprochement on this matter. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Political Council: Establishment of Construction Committee; Liu Zhe Delivers Instructions on Behalf of Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Construction Committee was established at 10 AM this morning. Men Zhizhong and all members participated in the establishment ceremony. Liu Zhe delivered instructions on behalf of Song Zheyuan, saying that the Political Council had many construction matters in Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin, and the construction bureaus of the two provinces and cities had not been able to take care of the construction of the entire province, so after repeated discussions, it was decided to establish the Construction Committee. I hope that the committee members will study construction projects related to the national economy and beneficial to people's livelihood and handle them in advance. Men Zhi answered, saying that the scope of this committee is to build highways and develop water conservancy and agricultural communities, to seek production with the slogan of economic construction, to restore rural areas, and to enrich and strengthen the country.

<p>(Tianjin) Smuggling groups of ronin浪人 are rushing to sell off their goods to get cash because there is too much smuggled goods piled up in Tianjin, which is accumulating capital. Smuggled goods imports were suspended on the 19th and 20th. Customs investigations have revealed that 220,000 bags of sugar, 50,000 boxes of rayon, totaling 1.5 million pieces, and 30,000 bundles of cotton cloth are currently stored in a certain restricted zone in Tianjin, which must be sold off within at least one month. Temporary smuggling is unlikely to recur. In order to dump smuggled goods, the ronin have sent people to the hinterland of Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces for investigation, and are contacting small capital merchants to sell on consignment. The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin has been processing fake tourist visas for Japanese people for several days, five or six cases a day. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) How should the much-anticipated constitutional draft be further revised? It is now understood that the Central Constitutional Draft Review Committee has made a preliminary decision and has drafted a review report, which has been submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval. The Central Standing Committee, originally scheduled to be held on the 20th, has been rescheduled because it is awaiting Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian, and others to attend the meeting and express their opinions. It is reported that the Central Constitutional Draft Review Committee's review report has made concrete provisions for each point that should be further amended in the constitutional draft. The added transitional clauses are listed in the chapter of the annex to the original draft, but the name of the annex chapter has been changed to "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution." The important contents of the transitional clauses are: The National Assembly convened to formulate the constitution shall be the first National Assembly; The county magistrate shall be temporarily appointed by the government, and shall be elected by the people after the completion of local autonomy; Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan shall be temporarily elected in part and temporarily appointed by the government in part, and shall be fully elected by the people at an appropriate time; The issue of the implementation of the Constitution is not to make a provision of "to be implemented from the date of promulgation" in the Constitution, and will be stipulated by a resolution of the National Assembly in the future; Granting the president the power to issue emergency orders has been listed in the chapter on the central political system in the section on the president, and stipulates that in the event of an emergency or a major change in the economy that requires rapid disposal, the president may issue an emergency order after submitting it to a meeting of the Executive Yuan for resolution; The term of office of the president, vice president, and national representatives shall be changed from four years to six years; The term of office of the heads of the five Yuan and the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan shall also be changed from four years to three years. Articles 139 to 144 in the chapter on education in the original draft involve trivial details and have been deleted and combined into one article. In addition, the opinions of all parties have not yet been concentrated on the issue of "the president's overall administrative power." Some advocate not stipulating it, some advocate changing it to "the president's overall political affairs," and some also advocate maintaining the original plan and stipulating it in the Constitution. How to solve it should be decided during the Central Standing Committee this week. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Correction to Chairman Lin's Speech at the Memorial Service for Establishing the Capital in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The previous telegram regarding Chairman Lin's speech at the memorial service for the ninth anniversary of the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing on the 18th should be corrected. The original speech was as follows: "...It is not just Nanjing's local fortune. Its importance is extremely closely related to the prosperity and decline of China's national destiny and the peace of the Far East. If the countryside goes bankrupt and the four seas are in distress, the capital cannot prosper alone. If the border areas are in trouble and the bandit disasters in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces are not eliminated, the capital cannot celebrate stability alone. Since ancient times, it has been said that 'adversity makes a nation strong.' We hope that the past national disasters have reached their limit. When things reach their extreme, they will turn around. We should uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, continue the spirit of establishing the capital in Nanjing, work hard, and consolidate the national foundation..." Should be changed to "...We must first make all places stable and prosperous. Therefore, we hope that the leaders who have local responsibilities will pay attention at all times and strive to carry out construction on the one hand, and pay attention to stabilizing the people on the other. The two things can be done simultaneously in order to achieve Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great hope and mission of building the capital in Nanjing..." 20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

(20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At noon on the 20th, a boiler exploded in the newly built Xin Du Bathhouse in Changjing Lou, Beijing, causing a tragic disaster in which eleven people were killed and more than thirty were injured. The Xin Du Bathhouse opened on February 2nd and had been doing good business. Recently, because the old boiler was not suitable, a new boiler was replaced. A test run was conducted at 4 PM on the 20th, and suddenly there was an explosion, and the houses collapsed. Bathers and tea servants rushed to escape, and some were even naked. One can imagine the chaos of the situation. After the police station received the news, it immediately dispatched dozens of policemen to maintain order. Doctors from the Drum Tower and Central Hospitals rushed to rescue the injured, rescuing more than thirty injured people and sending them to the two hospitals for treatment. Nine bodies that were bombed and crushed were excavated on the spot, bloody and unrecognizable. There was still one body that was half-covered by a wall, half hanging in the pool, that had not been excavated. As for the workers beside the boiler, they must have been killed in the explosion, but the exact number has not yet been determined. One person sent to the Central Hospital died from his injuries. One person and two children in the Drum Tower Hospital are also in critical condition. After the accident, the police immediately blocked traffic to maintain order. However, nearby residents, knowing that their families had gone to bathe, rushed to observe, causing overcrowding. The police had no choice but to use water to drive them away, and the cries of women were even more painful. Sun Yonglu, the manager of the bathhouse, has been summoned for questioning to investigate responsibility and discuss follow-up matters. As for the cause of the boiler explosion, whether it was due to poor quality or excessive heat, it is not yet known. (20th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Central Authorities Hold Two Weekly Memorial Services; Jiang Zuobin Presides and Reports; Chairman Lin Speaks on the Guiding Principles of Exercising Civil Rights</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Authorities held the twentieth weekly memorial service at nine o'clock in the morning on the 20th. Present were Central Committee members Jiang Zuobin, Jing Hengyi, Lin Sen, Li Zonghuang, Wang Yongbin, He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, Yu Feipeng, Hong Ludong, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Qi, Xu Enzeng, Hong Lanyou, Huang Musong, Zhang Zhen, and all staff members, totaling more than 700 people.

Officials from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions are also invited to give lectures to the trainees. The second phase is about to be completed, and the third phase is being convened. The purpose of running the institute is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>To enable the actual situation of each county and city to reach the central government, and to enable the responsible personnel of each county to fully understand the intentions of the central government's various policies and decrees. After such communication between the central and local governments, it is hoped that local administration can be effectively promoted, and the central government's policies and decrees will be practical, so as to avoid the irresponsibility of merely producing meaningless official documents. Local administrative personnel can be educated and instructed by the central government officials. Jiang finished his speech and the meeting adjourned at 9:40 AM.

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave an impromptu speech on "The Guiding Principles of Exercising Civil Rights." The ceremony ended at 10:30 AM after the speech. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech on "The Guiding Principles of Exercising Civil Rights" at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the morning of the 20th. He first elaborated in great detail on the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the separation of powers and functions. He also said that the Chinese people have just been liberated from an autocratic regime and may not understand how to exercise civil rights. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had also considered this point, so he wrote "The Fundamentals of Civil Rights" and stipulated the three stages of military government, tutelage government, and constitutional government in the Outline of National Reconstruction, proceeding in an orderly and methodical manner. This is truly patient guidance and painstaking effort. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen is not only the founding father of the Republic of China, but also the guide for all the people of the Republic of China to exercise civil rights. He went on to say that the draft constitution will be promulgated soon, and the start of constitutional government is not far away. How the people will exercise civil rights, consolidate the central government, and build an omnipotent and stronger government to lead the people of the whole country and lay the foundation for the Republic of China for ten thousand years is a matter for the National Assembly to discuss at length. However, I am therefore reminded of the greatness of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's invention. I feel that the rights of the people and the abilities of the government are closely related. When we recall the difficulties that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the martyrs of our party, and other comrades faced in creating the Republic of China, we cannot help but feel endless emotion. Therefore, today's topic of exercising civil rights is a way to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen and to drink water and remember its source. Finally, I hope that everyone will study together, implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's invention, build the country with the people, and advance towards universal harmony, completing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will.

<h3>The Western Hemisphere International League Plan</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries have arbitrarily destroyed international treaties, the collective security of the Old World has become virtually defunct. War clouds are densely gathering over Europe and Asia. The failure of the Geneva system has stimulated the countries of the Western Hemisphere. Recently, the Pan-American Peace Conference is being actively prepared, and those enthusiastic about peace in the New World are advocating the organization of an international alliance in the Western Hemisphere. This plan has been proposed by the Dominican Republic and supported by Uruguay. The United States, which has always been indifferent to international cooperation, has also expressed active interest. According to sources in Washington, the main points of the New World Peace Plan proposed by the United States are as follows: a tariff truce among the countries of the Americas; the use of economic sanctions against aggressor countries in the Americas; the establishment of a permanent security system to guarantee peace in the Americas; and the adoption of a unified neutral policy towards European wars.</p>
<p>The first item, the tariff truce, is the consistent policy of Secretary of State Hull. The fourth item, neutrality towards Europe, is the traditional foreign policy of the United States. However, the economic system and the permanent security system are what the United States has always opposed. The fact that Washington has made such a statement has profound significance and is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The reason why the countries of the Western Hemisphere have a new demand for an international alliance is that they deeply feel that the International League in Geneva is no longer sufficient to maintain world peace. Since its establishment, the Geneva system has been considered by commentators as an organization in one corner of Europe, without the ability or determination to actively participate in matters of Asia and the Americas. The matter of the Americas has actually left the scope of the International League due to the League's recognition of the Monroe Doctrine and the non-participation of the United States in the International League. Regarding the matter of Asia, since the September 18th Incident, the tolerance of the invasion of Japan by Britain and France has actually been beyond the reach of the Geneva whip. With the outbreak of the war in Italian Abyssinia, the calls of Germany to abolish Versailles and Locarno have turned into practical actions. Geneva is unable to deal with matters in Europe itself, let alone Asia and the Americas. Therefore, the countries of Central and South America that joined the League of Nations have a sense of disappointment. In recent years, Washington has been promoting the Good Neighbor Policy under the leadership of Secretary of State Hull, and has expressed sincere friendship to the Central and South American countries in form. It abolished the Platt Amendment, which bound the freedom of Cuba and encroached on Cuban sovereignty, in Cuba. It withdrew American troops from countries such as Nicaragua. It signed reciprocal tariff treaties with countries such as Colombia. The improvement of the relationship between the United States and Latin America is truly the success of Hull's diplomacy and the main reason for Washington's victory over Geneva.</p>
<p>As for why the United States is abandoning its attitude of acting alone and is willing to cooperate with Latin American countries in economic and political terms, the biggest reason is to obtain the entire American market and exclude the forces of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany from outside the New World. In the past, dollar diplomacy has aroused resentment from Latin American countries, and incidents of rejecting the United States and defaulting on debts have occurred from time to time. If the weak are threatened with violence, they will inevitably seek ways to resist in every possible way. The pro-British and anti-American sentiments of the South American countries in the past were due to the high-pressure policies of the United States, which caused the countries to suffer great emotional stimulation. The greater the effect, the greater the reaction. Since the tide of the world economic crisis hit the United States, American goods could not be sold in the world market, and Europe and Asia were competing to build tariff barriers. Therefore, President Roosevelt changed his past attitude, abandoned the distant and sought the near, and devoted himself to improving the national relations of Central and South American countries and increasing the amount of American trade to the south. However, economic cooperation must be conditioned on political peace. The stability of the New World order is in the interest of the United States. This is the main reason why the Washington government is striving for collective peace in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>As for the extent and effectiveness of this collective peace, we cannot yet judge. The purpose of the United States is economic mutual assistance, while the purpose of the Latin American countries is political equality. Is the wealthy and powerful United States willing to join Panama and the Dominican Republic and share the right to vote in the international arena of the Western Hemisphere? Small countries are everywhere in the Western Hemisphere, and few are worthy of mention other than Brazil, Chile, and Argentina.</p>
<p>If a country engages in aggression, can the countries make effective sanctions against the United States? These problems are not easy to solve. Therefore, the Western Hemisphere International League can be regarded as an ideal, but the date of realization may be very distant.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing World Silver Prices; China, the United States, and Britain Reach Agreement; U.S. Officials Make No Clear Statement; Silver Price Increase Due to Speculation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials here are unwilling to comment on the claim that China, the United States, and Britain will reach an agreement to stabilize silver prices and support the Chinese currency. According to an editorial published in the New York Commercial News today, this proposal may come after the Chinese banker Chen Guangfu spoke with Finance Minister Morgenthau. The most powerful sources here indicate that there will not be such an agreement at present. As for the rise in silver prices, some officials believe that it is due to speculative activity rather than an international agreement. Speculators may anticipate such an agreement, but this is also the wedding season in India, so the demand for silver has increased greatly and always rises every year. The Commercial News said that the purpose of the agreement is that the United States will buy Chinese silver at a slightly higher price than the world market, and China will allow it not to sell silver elsewhere. In this way, the uncertainty of world silver prices can be avoided in the future. Britain will provide credit to expand the foreign exchange sources of Chinese banks and stabilize the exchange rate of the yuan. (20th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter learned from responsible sources today that the silver issue was the main topic of discussion between Finance Minister Morgenthau and the head of the Chinese banking group, Chen Guangfu. However, the issue of establishing a silver agreement to jointly assist China by the United States and Britain has not yet been raised. The news from New York regarding this matter is groundless. Although the United States and Britain have long expressed their interest in the financial and political integrity of China, they have not yet considered joint action towards China. The talks did not involve the establishment of a tripartite silver agreement. It is believed here that if the United States continues to purchase Chinese silver, this move will be completely in line with the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act. Also, the price paid by the government for silver will not exceed the market price of the world market, so as to avoid criticism from domestic public opinion during this year's election. Experts here do not believe that China will sell a large amount of silver, because China must retain a large amount of silver as currency reserves. (19th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Financial circles here expect that the currency negotiations between U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and the Chinese bankers visiting the U.S. may result in the U.S. agreeing to buy Chinese silver. If so, the U.S. can meet its needs under the Silver Purchase Act and offer a lower price than elsewhere. At the same time, China has cash deposited abroad, so China's exchange rate position can be more trusted than domestic silver reserves. The Times commented on the Sino-U.S. talks, saying that the U.S. has already purchased a large amount of silver from China, and the Chinese bankers in Washington are qualified to represent the Nanjing government in negotiating an agreement. Judging from today's situation, silver holders are preparing to sell, but the Financial News said that they are waiting and hoping to recover the losses they suffered in December last year. The Times said that speculators have suffered losses and are greatly disappointed. It is surprising that they still intend to be bullish.

<h3>British Ship Passing Marseille Heading East; Antiquities Safe and Sound; Exhibition to be Held in Nanjing in June</h3>
<p>(Marseille, France) The British Shipping Company's mail ship "Rampur," carrying Chinese antiquities back to China, ran aground outside the port of Gibraltar and was stranded for 36 hours before it was rescued.

<h3>Japanese Complete Basic Survey for Developing North China's Economy</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), which is working to develop the economy of North China, has been cooperating with the Tianjin Garrison for the past year to carry out a basic economic survey with great sacrifice as a preparatory work. At the end of last year, in order to ensure its smooth implementation and progress, it established an office in Tianjin. As a result of the urgent survey, the survey of finance, commerce, industry, etc. within the basic department was completed at the end of March. Currently, it is investigating the remaining departments of transportation, railways, ports, and agriculture. Mantetsu has drafted a survey report on the completed departments and submitted it to the authorities. Based on this basic survey, it will cooperate with relevant agencies to conduct practical research to make it concrete. The goal of its implementation is to absolutely avoid the North China industry oppressing the Japanese and Manchurian industries or conflicting with each other. The fundamental principle is to form a so-called "China-Japan-Manchuria" economic group with China, Japan, and "Manchuria" helping each other. Under this principle, Mantetsu will induce domestic and Mantetsu capital to invest in North China. (20th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese-Egyptian Trade Negotiations; Japanese Representative Rejects Egyptian Proposal; Will Raise Prices to Stop Dumping</h3>
<p>(Cairo) The trade talks between Japan and Egypt are currently underway here. According to Dr. Kasama, the Japanese representative, Japan is well aware that the cutthroat dumping method will eventually harm its commerce. Therefore, it will soon implement a new foreign trade policy. Dr. Kasama rejected Egypt's conditional proposal to abolish the 40% surtax on Japanese goods, saying that Japan may soon raise prices instead of dumping, so there is no need to pay the surtax. If so, although sales will decrease, the increased price can offset the loss. Dr. Kasama informed the Egyptian government that Japan plans to reduce the goods sold to Egypt to the total value of its purchase of Egyptian cotton. According to this method, Japan's export trade to Egypt will decrease by 23% compared with the previous year. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Build Many New Ships; Engage in Pearl Fishing in the South Pacific; Profits Nearly £300,000 Last Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Thirty-six Japanese pearl fishing boats engaged in pearl fishing in the Arafura Sea between the Dutch East Indies and Northern Australia last year, earning a profit of nearly £300,000.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Discusses the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute; Italian Representative Insists on Peace Conditions; Ethiopia Demands Increased Sanctions from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a secret meeting this morning at 10:45 AM, chaired by Australian representative Bruce. It was resolved that this extraordinary session would not be adjourned today. Subsequently, at 11:00 AM, an open meeting was convened. French representative and Minister Without Portfolio, Pengou, and Italian representative Aloisi sat to the right of the chairman, while British representative and Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet representative and Ambassador to France, Potemkin, sat to the left. Ethiopian representative and Minister to France, Walta, sat at one end of the horseshoe-shaped conference table. Attendance was quite sparse. First, the chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, Madariaga, read the report (regarding the mediation of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute). The conclusion stated that an immediate cessation of hostilities in East Africa and the restoration of peace through reconciliation was hopeless under the current circumstances. Chairman Bruce then proposed that representatives from both countries express their views. Italian representative Aloisi and Ethiopian representative Walta then spoke in succession, their speeches being lengthy and not finishing until the adjournment. Aloisi's language was moderate, and his arguments consisted of three points:  The two parties should conduct direct negotiations;  These negotiations should be held outside Geneva;  Italy must wait until the preliminary peace terms are established before ceasing hostilities in the northern front. Ethiopian representative Walta, however, demanded that all sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant be fully implemented. The Administrative Council then extended the meeting to 3:00 PM this afternoon, when British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Minister Without Portfolio Pengou expressed their opinions. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During this morning's non-public meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council at 10:30 AM, Italian representative Aloisi spoke, accusing Ethiopia of not making efforts for reconciliation. He also stated that he did not believe the Committee of Thirteen had the authority to investigate the use of poison gas in the Ethiopian war zone. Furthermore, he asserted that Italy could not cease hostilities until the preliminary conditions for peace had been established and the security of Italian troops was guaranteed. Ethiopian representative Mariamou then spoke, lodging a protest, accusing the League of Nations of failing to provide Ethiopia, which had been subjected to aggression, with the assistance it deserved. He also requested that the League of Nations fully invoke Article 16 of the League Covenant and implement sanctions.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a passionate speech, stating that if aggression were allowed to succeed, the League of Nations could not exist. Aggression must not be allowed to benefit.</p>
<p>Italian representative Aloisi stated that no government had ever shown as much goodwill toward the League of Nations as Italy. Italy had never refused to participate in any discussion initiated by the League of Nations. However, Italy had to adhere to its own principles and suggestions. Regarding the recent negotiations in Geneva, the Italian government had agreed that the League of Nations could send representatives to participate in the peace talks, demonstrating that its actions did not deviate from the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. Italy's proposals did not conflict with international law or the League of Nations Covenant. Its proposal was the best way to achieve reconciliation. The failure of the reconciliation process was the responsibility of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government rejected all proposals and admitted that its representative came to Geneva with the intention of not negotiating. Regarding the use of poison gas in the East African war zone, the Italian government had the right to retaliate against Ethiopia's atrocities. He opposed the Committee of Thirteen's recommendation to investigate this matter, arguing that this action was not within the committee's jurisdiction and that this was a major issue that should not be discussed hastily.</p>
<p>Ethiopian representative Mariamou refuted the claim that Ethiopia was responsible for the failure of the peace talks, stating that the world should not have any illusions that Ethiopia was responsible for the failure of the peace talks. In reality, Italy deliberately delayed the negotiations to slow down the implementation of sanctions. Polish Foreign Minister Beck stated that the Polish government was prepared to cooperate in finding a solution that could protect the League of Nations Covenant and the future of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Geneva The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting this morning at 11:00 AM. Italian representative Aloisi immediately delivered a speech, explaining his country's position. He stated that his country had always treated the League of Nations with goodwill and had never refused to attend discussions. It wanted all the provisions of the Covenant to be implemented, not just certain clauses. Regarding the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, Italy had agreed to maintain contact with the League of Nations and the Committee of Thirteen, and it was willing to notify the League of Nations of the results of direct negotiations. "Italy not only respects the letter of the League of Nations Covenant, but also its spirit. Justice and fairness must be upheld. If respect is not given and the history of human life is not understood, then the League of Nations Covenant is meaningless, because human civilization is not static but dynamic and must be understood." Aloisi also stated that negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia should be conducted outside Geneva, which does not conflict with the League of Nations Covenant or diplomatic practice. As for Italy's refusal to cease hostilities before the establishment of preliminary peace terms, the reason was that it did not want Ethiopia to use this opportunity to catch its breath and reorganize its troops to replenish its strength, forcing Italian troops to fight again. In short, the preliminary conditions for peace negotiations proposed by the Italian government were the best way for Italy and Ethiopia to compromise with each other. Ethiopia had long decided that it was unwilling to conduct negotiations, and the Committee of Thirteen's mediation efforts failed, for which Ethiopia should bear the responsibility. Aloisi finally responded to the Committee of Thirteen's inquiry regarding the use of poison gas, stating that this issue was not within the scope of the committee's jurisdiction and that the important rights to which all parties concerned are legally entitled should not be decided without due process. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At this morning's open meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, after Italian representative Aloisi delivered his speech, Ethiopian representative Walta then spoke. He began by stating that his government had protested on the 18th of this month against the League of Nations' delay in providing assistance to Ethiopia in accordance with the Covenant. As for the Italian government's suggestion to the Committee of Thirteen, which was to request peace negotiations, it only accepted it in principle. Its intention was to delay the implementation of sanctions by the League of Nations, allowing it to postpone the oil embargo and to use this opportunity to bargain as a condition for its participation in various European issues. Walta finally requested the Administrative Council to fully implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant to prevent the aggressor from doing as it pleases.

<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Plan to Draft a Resolution; Respect the Spirit of the Covenant; Call on Italy and Ethiopia to Cease Hostilities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of various countries in the League of Nations Administrative Council who have no direct relationship with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute drafted a resolution this morning, preparing to submit it to the Administrative Council for discussion. The content reportedly explains that the failure of the Committee of Thirteen's mediation efforts was due to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal of four preliminary conditions for peace negotiations (as seen in yesterday's dispatch). It also makes a renewed appeal to Italy, stating that now is the time when international cooperation is necessary to maintain peace and that the country must uphold the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and strive to resolve the current dispute. In addition, the report submitted by Madariaga, chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, and Ethiopia's acceptance of the League of Nations' invitation to participate in peace negotiations will be placed on file. Regarding the methods of warfare used by the belligerents, it will be declared that both countries are signatories to the 1925 Geneva Protocol and should refuse to use poison gas. British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Minister Without Portfolio Pengou, and Spanish representative and Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, Madariaga, are currently reviewing this draft resolution. Once the review is complete, it will be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>To Cope With the Current European Situation, Britain and France Reach a Compromise; Outcome of Talks Between Eden and Pengou; Mutual Concessions to Maintain Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Paris) As a result of talks held in Geneva last Friday (17th) between British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Minister Without Portfolio Pengou, the two countries have reached a consensus on the current situation in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Renowned journalist Bay wrote an article in the Écho de Paris, commenting on this matter, saying, "The British and French delegations believe that the compromise reached by Eden and Pengou is a kind of exchange of mutual concessions based on a friendly spirit, so that the situation will not create more complications and the position of the League of Nations will feel threatened. Eden's achievements at the time were nothing more than the following: France must not act impulsively, leading to an angry withdrawal from the League of Nations, because although the League of Nations is powerless to solve the Rhineland problem, if France breaks with the League of Nations, it will make the Nile River problem (referring to the relationship between Britain and Italy) more difficult. France must not cancel the current sanctions against Italy and must continue to adhere to the League of Nations Covenant. Regarding the Rhineland problem, Britain will conduct negotiations with Germany to consider the peace plans proposed by Germany and France at the same time, but France must allow time for Britain to proceed leisurely. Pengou's achievements are as follows: Although the current sanctions against Italy can be maintained, they should not be intensified. Britain must treat the Rhineland incident and the Italo-Ethiopian dispute equally and must not favor one over the other, so as not to increase Germany's arrogance and lead to further acts of breaking the treaty, and Italy will not be disappointed, because Italy is now ready to rejoin the European collective security organization. Regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the British and French governments must cooperate sincerely to find a peaceful solution." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations is Untrustworthy; Ethiopians Must Rely on Their Own Strength</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa The Ethiopian delegation to the League of Nations has reported to the government the failure of the Committee of Thirteen's reconciliation efforts. Official sources have stated that the Ethiopian government is extremely disappointed to hear this news, because Ethiopia has always trusted the League of Nations. From now on, it will have to rely on its own strength. These sources also stated that Italian troops are now advancing towards the capital, and resistance will be encountered along the way. However, if the Italian troops defeat the Ethiopian army, the capital is an undefended city, and it is not planned to send troops to defend the vicinity. However, the official sources refused to say where the Ethiopian troops are concentrated, how many troops there are, and where the Italian troops have arrived. Regarding the talk of the government moving south, although there is such a saying, it has not yet been decided. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Only Eighty Miles From Addis Ababa; Ethiopian Troops Prepare for Final Resistance; Men and Women, United in Hatred, are Willing to Fight to the End; Foreign Nationals Flee for Their Lives, Causing Roads to Become Clogged</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa It is reported that Italian troops are only eighty miles from the city, and Ethiopian troops are currently preparing for a final defense to protect the capital. The patriotism of the Ethiopian people has not diminished. Yesterday, a crowd gathered at the racecourse to listen to the Ethiopian King's edict, ordering men capable of wielding weapons to gather weapons, bullets, and food and wait for orders to depart, with those who disobey being whipped and fined. Five thousand people immediately announced that they were willing to fight to the death. The luckier ones had received rifles, while the rest had only knives and spears. Ethiopians from the western provinces, along with newly recruited soldiers, plan to consider Addis Ababa an undefended city to avoid Italian aircraft attacks. Therefore, they will not enter the capital, but will join the King and Crown Prince's army in the mountains for a final defense. Although the King's whereabouts are still unclear, it is reported that he is determined to fight to the end and still leads the most important part of his army. Italian troops are now apparently advancing from Taissi in two directions. One is probing the town of Awash, on the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, which is ninety-five miles east of Addis Ababa. The other is approaching the town of Agabah, fifty miles north of Awash, and gradually approaching the mountains of North Assab. It is reported that the Crown Prince, using heavy rain and high mountains as cover, has reorganized his troops in Taissi and retreated to defend the mountains of North Assab. It is widely believed that even if Italian troops occupy Addis Ababa, the King can still retreat to the mountains further west and harass the Italian troops' long lines of communication caused by their rapid advance. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Although the Ethiopian army has suffered heavy losses and morale has been low in the past few weeks, Ethiopian women are not afraid and are still urging their men to resist the Italian army. Hundreds of women and five thousand disorderly people armed with knives, spears, and a few guns gathered in the suburbs to discuss the issue of defending the capital. Before the meeting, the government issued a declaration stating that all men must do their best to defend their freedom and that it is better to die as Ethiopian ghosts than to live as Italian slaves. The spirit of Adwa will never die. The guards hope that Addis Ababa can be spared from Italian air attacks. Today, they ordered the retreating northern troops to detour. At the same time, a special train full of refugees headed towards Djibouti. However, neutral observers believe that fighting will soon break out in Addis Ababa, with most women and men sharing the responsibility of defending the city. Officials here are concerned about General Nasibu's troops due to the lack of battle reports from the southern front. The claim that Italian motorized troops have occupied Jijiga has not yet been confirmed here, but it is reported that the Ethiopian army is unwilling to defend the 12,000-foot-high Tarmaber Pass, which is the only way for the Italian army to attack Addis Ababa. The Italian army must climb 8,000 feet to reach the plains. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The government recently ordered all residents of the city to gather at the racecourse, where a palace spokesman appealed to the residents to arm themselves in order to resist the Italian army as strongly as possible. It is not yet known where the Italian troops have arrived at this time. The people of the capital are quite panicked. Rumors have it that most officials have taken their families out of the capital, while foreign nationals have gathered in their respective embassies, packing their luggage and preparing to leave the capital tonight or tomorrow morning. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Foreign nationals here are greatly alarmed by rumors that Italian troops will arrive within days. Belgian military officers and many other foreign nationals are preparing to depart today for Djibouti in French Somaliland. The German embassy has instructed German nationals and those under its protection where to go when the Italian army enters the city, and has ordered them to make a list of all their belongings and prepare bedding and food to be stored in the embassy. It is expected that the Ethiopian government will decide to move the capital sooner or later. British and Belgian medical teams have now arrived in Addis Ababa from the northern front. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa Since last night, the people of Addis Ababa have been in a state of great panic, with people fleeing with their elderly and children. The roads outside the city are almost completely clogged. This atmosphere of terror has also affected foreigners, who are also moving to safe places to avoid Italian bombing. At the same time, the train to Djibouti is so crowded with refugees that there is no room left. Furthermore, according to消息the Associated Press, Italian troops have crossed the Lot River and are no more than sixty miles from Addis Ababa. This news has been confirmed by Ethiopian messengers. Judging from the current situation, the Ethiopians do not seem to have the courage to defend Addis Ababa to the death. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The British Embassy here is gradually becoming the last center of activity in Addis Ababa. Most of the people are now requesting to be accommodated in the protected area. The perimeter of the embassy's open space has been set up with barbed wire, and a company of Indian soldiers is stationed there, led by British officers. The embassy can accommodate the three thousand foreigners currently residing here, and is equipped with gas masks and food and water. Of the foreigners here, two thousand are British nationals, mostly Indians. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa It is rumored that Italian troops have arrived at Enkoba, which is a key point on the main road between the capital and Dessie, 125 kilometers northeast of the capital and 150 kilometers southwest of Dessie. If this news is confirmed, then one of the most difficult sections between the capital and Dessie has been crossed by the Italian troops. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Between Two Armies on the Southern Front; Heavy Losses in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Fall of Harar Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(Rome) Rumors have it that Italian troops on the southern front have occupied Harar and Jijiga, but official and semi-official sources have not confirmed this news. Well-informed sources have also stated that, according to frontline reports, Italian General Nasi's troops on the southern front have been fighting fiercely for days with Ethiopian General Nasibu's well-equipped troops, and only yesterday did they manage to win and advance on the Addis Ababa-Dananah Sagaaga-Dagaa Modo road. Therefore, the claim that Harar and Jijiga have been occupied is probably premature. Furthermore, although recent reports say that Italian troops have won a complete victory, there has never been any mention of the Ethiopian army having been routed, because it is rumored that General Nasibu still has reinforcements that can be dispatched. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, telegraphed today that Italian troops have launched an offensive against Harar. General Graziani's troops on the southern front began their attack at dawn on April 14th. General Nasi's Libyan division fought fiercely with General Taitantu's troops on the left flank of the Italian front. The Ethiopians suffered hundreds of deaths, including several important chieftains. The Italians suffered only ten white officer casualties and several hundred soldiers killed or wounded. However, three air force officers were injured, and two aircraft crashed into their own lines. The battle was extremely fierce, lasting for two and a half days, and as a result, the enemy was completely defeated.</p>
<p>According to a correspondent with the Italian troops on the southern front, the battle went as follows: Ten white officers and six hundred Libyan and Somali soldiers were killed. Ten thousand Ethiopian troops participated in the battle, carrying new weapons and a large number of machine guns. They dug trenches and held fast near the narrow gorge of the Golawadi River, and used caves and cliffs to place machine guns to suppress the Italian troops. On April 15th, a large Libyan unit, with mixed and Somali troops on both flanks, stormed the gorge in heavy rain with tanks and field artillery. At dusk, they reached a tributary of the Golawadi River. The next morning, they continued their attack with the help of three Libyan regiments. Ethiopian machine gun bullets were as dense as rain. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat for several hours without a clear winner. At midnight, the Ethiopian troops risked an attack, trying to encircle the Italian front line, but were repulsed. At dawn, a Taibazi unit launched an encircling attack and was ambushed by Ethiopian troops, many of whom died in a hail of machine gun bullets. At the same time, three Libyan regiments defended the Ethiopian troops who were fiercely attacking the Italian left flank. So the Italian commander, Nasi, used all the reserves to fight. Seeing their leader killed, the Ethiopian troops all lost their will to fight and retreated. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Scotland: Water Monster Appears Again; Over Ten Feet Long, Covered in Scales; Head Shaped Like a Snake, Makes a Hissing Sound</h3>
<p>(London) It is said that there is a monster in Loch Ness, Scotland, which appears and disappears unpredictably. According to three students from the University of Glasgow, the monster has recently appeared again. They all witnessed it and said, "Last Saturday evening, we were idle after class, so we went for a walk in the countryside. We came to a towering cliff about eight kilometers outside Fort Augustus, so we sat down next to it to rest. Suddenly, we heard a hissing sound in the lake, and then we saw a monster, covered in scales, its color dark brown, emerging from the water and swimming towards the shore. It moved extremely quickly, and when it was about forty meters from the shore, it suddenly dodged, as if it had seen something dangerous, but then it disappeared into the lake. This lasted for about two minutes. The monster was nine meters long, with a very small head, like a snake's head, and very small eyes. It moved extremely quickly, emitting a loud noise, like boiling water bubbling or like the sound of the "Mingyu" ship sailing. When it moved, its body undulated up and down in a wave shape, and it seemed to have three peaks on its back." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Australia Boycotts Japanese Goods; Japan Decides to Retaliate; Government Considering Measures</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that if Australia continues to enact high tariffs to block Japanese goods, the Japanese government will be forced to take retaliatory measures. Australia is now severely restricting Japanese goods, but is very accommodating to cotton cloth and rayon. If Australia's policy continues, Japan's trade with Australia will be put to death. The Japanese government is currently considering the most appropriate measures to deal with this situation, and may be forced to adopt restrictions on Australian goods such as wool and wheat, and purchase them from other countries instead.

<p>Jerusalem - Following the outbreak of conflicts between Arabs and Jews yesterday, the situation is serious. All shops in Jaffa are closed, and streets are patrolled by helmeted police officers. The military is also on alert. It is reported that Jews killed two Arabs in retaliation for the killing of one Jew. When the two Arabs killed yesterday were being buried, the two sides clashed, resulting in a major conflict. According to police reports, the Arabs were fighting among themselves, resulting in the deaths of two people, which were not caused by the Jews. After the unrest, order was restored through the vigorous suppression by the military and police. According to reports from the Jewish side, nine Jews died during the disturbances, eleven were seriously injured, and twenty-eight were slightly injured. It is reported that there were also casualties on the Arab side. The government has decided to do everything in its power to minimize the possibility of further unrest. Sir Arthur Wauchope has been ordered to consider issuing emergency ordinances if necessary. Last night at 9:00 PM, a curfew was announced in Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Therefore, the two places were very quiet after nightfall. Jewish merchants stationed in Jaffa, fearing the recurrence of unrest, have now fled to Tel Aviv. During yesterday's clashes, a British engineer and his wife were hit by stones thrown by rioters. Although they were both hit, they were only slightly injured. The telephone lines between Jerusalem and Jaffa are now controlled by the government, but transportation between Jaffa and Haifa has been completely suspended. According to the government's latest report, the situation is not expected to deteriorate. Although the military is on alert, there is no need to deploy them yet. (Reuter, 20th)</p>

<h3>Greece Increases Military Spending - National Defense Plan to be Completed in Four Years - Reply to Turkey to be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>Athens - The Greek government decided today to increase national defense spending by 6,200,000 drachmas. The national defense plan will be completed in four years. (National Telegraph, 19th) Athens - According to officials here, the Greek government's reply to the Turkish government's note regarding the Dardanelles Strait will be delivered within the week. The wording of the reply note is said to be friendly. Public opinion here believes that if the Great Powers are willing to repeal the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the strait, Greece should have the right to arm the islands of Samothrace and Lemnos. If the League of Nations is willing to repeal Article 18 of the Treaty of Lausanne, then Greece can demand the repeal of Article 13, thus enabling Greece to have the right to arm the islands of Chios and Samos. The Greek press generally agrees with this view and says that Greece is prepared to participate in future conferences regarding Turkey's demands. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin - Kawagoe Promoted to Ambassador - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Sone to Tianjin to Negotiate - Will Return Home Next Week to Receive New Mandate</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Regarding the selection of an ambassador to China, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after Arita's assumption of the position of Foreign Minister, had five candidates in mind. Among them, there were three who were considered most suitable and familiar with the situation in China: one was Tani Masayuki, the former Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Manchukuo, one was Sangishima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the third was Kawagoe Shigeru, the Consul-General stationed in Tianjin. Tani Masayuki was deemed unsuitable because Nan Jiro, the Commander of the Kwantung Army of the Ugaki faction, had lost power and was not approved by the current military. Sangishima was also deemed unsuitable because his current position was too important and a demotion would have left a void that could not be easily filled. Kawagoe, on the other hand, was on friendly terms with Vice Chief of Staff Umezu Yoshijiro. Military officials such as Nishiō (former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army) also had a good relationship with him. After Arita made a proposal to solicit the opinion of the military, he received their approval without much difficulty. Therefore, it was decided to promote him. However, out of caution, Arita specially sent Sone Masaru, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Tianjin on the 13th of this month to meet with Kawagoe, discuss his opinion, and also to visit the Japanese military commander stationed in Tianjin, Tada, to explain the intention to appoint Kawagoe. On the 14th, he transferred to Beiping and then flew to Jinan and Qingdao to inquire about the opinions of Nishida, the Consul-General stationed in Jinan, and Nishi, the Consul-General stationed in Qingdao. On the 17th, he returned home to report. According to Nishida, the Deputy Consul of Japan stationed in Tianjin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' order has not yet been issued. Whether Kawagoe will be promoted to Ambassador to China will be announced within two weeks. However, on the 17th, Kawagoe, in response to visitors, did not strongly deny the rumor of his promotion to ambassador. As for his own return home to receive the mandate, it must wait for the official order to be issued.</p>
<p>Kawagoe is currently 53 years old. He was originally a First-Class Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has served as Consul in Hankou and Guangzhou, and Consul-General in Jilin, Qingdao, and Jinan. He has been in China for 15 years. He came to Tianjin in 1935 to serve as Consul-General, and it has been one year and seven months. Since the Great Wall Incident in 1933, North China's diplomacy has been handled directly by the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, as well as military attachés stationed in Beiping and the Director of the Shanhaiguan Special Agency. Everything did not go through the hands of consular officials. The Consul-General and Consuls were like sinecures, with nothing to do. Occasionally, there would be one or two protests, which were also at the request of the military. Under these circumstances, no one could tolerate it, but Kawagoe alone was able to comply, so he did not clash with the military. This is why he was able to gain the sympathy of the military.

<h3>Japanese Consulate in Xiamen Negotiates Permanent Lease Rights; Taiwanese Rent Land and Forcibly Occupy Wasteland; City Government Orders Relocation of Graves Within Boundary</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese consul in Xiamen has been negotiating with the municipal government to request recognition of the permanent lease rights of Japanese residents and Taiwanese in Xiamen. The total population of Xiamen is over 180,000, and the Taiwanese Japanese population is over 15,500, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the population. The current Taiwanese are Minnan people who moved from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou before Japan occupied Taiwan and were later incorporated into Japanese nationality. Their customs, language, race, and history are inseparable from those of Minnan people. Now, their nationalities are completely different. Therefore, the Taiwanese in Xiamen can enjoy all privileges by virtue of their Japanese nationality, and they can also mingle in the city, posing as Chinese people and stealing the general rights of Chinese people. This is the origin of the recent negotiation of permanent lease rights for Japanese. The Taiwanese have lived in Xiamen for a long time, and private transactions among the people have gradually involved buying land and properties. Today, the Taiwanese in Xiamen own a large number of real estate properties such as land and houses. However, according to international law, foreigners cannot purchase real estate such as land or enjoy permanent lease rights within our country. Therefore, although the Taiwanese in Xiamen actually possess a large amount of real estate that has become a "fait accompli," and they privately exercise their "vested rights" of ownership, it is not permitted by law. Therefore, when legal issues are involved, such as lawsuits or others, the courts all make judgments based on the law, denying the permanent lease rights of foreign residents. As for the Japanese consulate's request to the municipal government for "recognition of permanent lease rights by the Chinese government," the motive stems from the case of the Japanese purchasing the site of Daguanyuan to build the Hongan-ji Temple. On April 9, the Japanese consul in Xiamen instructed the Taiwanese residents' association, saying, "In recent years, the Chinese courts have repeatedly ruled based on precedent No. 1757 of the Supreme Court of China in the twentieth year, denying the permanent lease rights of imperial subjects in this port. This is very unfavorable to us. Regarding this matter, we are currently negotiating with the Chinese people. For reference, please conduct a detailed investigation and report on whether Chinese courts have executed precedents recognizing imperial real estate permanent lease rights from around the twentieth year of the Republic of China to the present day." The Taiwan Association relayed the original order to various nationalities for investigation on the 14th. As for the Daguanyuan land purchase case, the land is located at the foot of Bailudong Mountain in the eastern part of Xiamen City, covering an area of eight or nine hundred square zhang. Initially named "Dahuayuan," it was originally a wilderness. The landlord was surnamed Chen, and it was passed down for more than two hundred years. Fifty years ago, it was still owned by Chen Shi, his successor. Later, Chen mortgaged it to his brother-in-law Wang Zhenfa, and soon sold it outright, becoming Wang's property. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, seven Taiwanese residents, Zhang Youji, Wang Wanji, Zheng Youyi, Chen Jingshan, Wu Yunfu, Lei Yi, and Cai Shixing, rented it from Wang for 1,000 yuan for a term of 60 years to build Daguanyuan. The original rented land was not very large. Zhang and others repeatedly occupied nearby wasteland, gradually encroaching on the foot of Bailu Mountain, and then encroaching on the Bailudong Temple land, and quarrying mountain stones, which once caused a backlash. They expanded it into today's area of eight or nine hundred square zhang. Within the boundary, there are more than eighty new and old graves. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhenfa resold it for another 1,000 yuan, and it became the property of Zhang and others. Later, the garden was also abandoned. Japanese Buddhists established the Hongan-ji Temple in Xiamen in the early years of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, but the temple site has always been rented. Last year, the Japanese consulate, led by Zhang Shaochuan and Dube, the chief of the Japanese police department, proposed building the Hongan-ji Temple on the Daguanyuan site. With the consent of Zhang and others, except for Wang Wanji's deceased family members in Taiwan, the remaining six signed and donated the Daguanyuan land to the Hongan-ji Temple, and raised 20,000 yuan from the Taiwanese as construction funds, which was deposited in the Bank of Taiwan. The abbot of the Hongan-ji Temple, Japanese monk Kanda Keiu, submitted a request to the Xiamen Public Security Bureau and the municipal government for record and permission to build the temple, and announced the relocation of graves within the boundary. The municipal government initially could not put it on file, and the Japanese consul came to negotiate. The municipal government then submitted a request to the provincial government for instructions, but the provincial government did not approve it, and forwarded it to the central government for instructions, and consulted the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but received no reply. However, the Japanese consul urged for a reply very urgently, and urged to announce the relocation of graves within the boundary first. The municipal government actually accepted the request, and announced on March 24, stating, "Within the old site of Daguanyuan, construction will soon begin. All graves within the boundary must be relocated by themselves within one month. After the deadline, the Public Works Bureau will relocate them on behalf of the owners," etc. The announcement did not mention "Letter from the Japanese Consul" or "Report from Japanese monk Kanda Keiu," nor did it mention "Building Hongan-ji Temple" or the names of the landlords. It is said that their intention is that national sovereignty cannot be easily promised. Once there is a word, it will be seized by the Japanese consul as evidence of "the Chinese government's recognition of the permanent lease rights of imperial subjects." This case is still under negotiation. Whether the establishment of permanent lease rights for Japanese in Xiamen will have a huge impact on the present and the future, so all parties are paying close attention to it. (April 19)</p>
<h3>Siam Revises Tariffs; Import Tax on Chinese Tea Increases Fourfold; Tax Rates on Chaozhou Porcelain and Sweeteners Imported into Siam Are Particularly High</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Siamese government has been implementing a policy of cracking down on overseas Chinese education in recent years, and under the direction of a certain country, it has increased import taxes on Chinese goods by more than ten times, making Chinese goods more expensive and difficult to sell. The people of that certain country can take the opportunity to monopolize the entire Siamese market and dump their own goods. The Shantou Siamese Chamber of Commerce, after receiving the news, was afraid that its members would not understand the severity of the Siamese tax increase, so it held a meeting to make a decision. On March 31, it temporarily suspended the allocation of a gang and investigated the actual situation of the tax increase, and then shipped the goods. It has now been learned that the period of the tax increase will be implemented from the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar. The tax rates originally stipulated on that day have been revised and gradually increased. However, although the Siamese government has new tax regulations for goods transported from Chinese ports, it still mostly does not collect taxes according to the rates, but separately increases the collection. The Siamese suburban chambers of commerce feel more and more difficult to allocate and transport goods. It is found that the tax on porcelain is the highest in this Siamese tax increase, followed by various kinds of raw vegetable dried sweeteners. Also, Guangdong tea merchants received a telegram from Siamese tea merchants, saying that the Siamese government has greatly increased the import tax rate on Chinese tea, about four times more than before. The increased import tax has increased from 90 cents per piece to 5 baht, that is, 2 baht per 100 kilograms (the tax increase is about four times stronger). Therefore, it has a great impact on the export of our Chinese tea. Tea merchants and others have jointly telegraphed the authorities to ask for relief. (April 17)</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Staff Member Arrested for Smuggling Military Supplies; Ma Guangwu Carried 400 Bullets and Was Exposed by Railway Police and Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jinan Station of the Jinpu Railway cracked a case of a train captain smuggling military supplies today (the 18th), which has aroused great attention from the society. Train No. 301 from Pinghu arrives in Jinan at 3:00 a.m. every day as usual, and departs from Jinan to Bohai at 3:31 a.m. Today (the 18th), when the train entered the station, the train captain Ma Guangwu, wearing plain clothes, carried a handbag and got off the train in Jinan, looking quite flustered. Railway policeman Liu Hanqing happened to be on duty on the platform. Seeing his suspicious appearance, he immediately stepped forward to question him. According to Ma, he is the train captain of this railway, and what he is carrying are batteries and other items. Liu asked to inspect it, but Ma insisted on refusing. After arguing for a long time, he opened it for inspection. Unexpectedly, there were 400 rounds of military bullets in the box. Liu Hanqing immediately took Ma to the Jinpu Railway Police Section for interrogation because the matter was of great importance, and telegraphed the Jinpu Railway Bureau to ask for instructions on how to deal with it.

<h3>At the Junction of Jiangsu and Shandong, Bandits Rob Merchant Ships and Passengers; Now They Have Fled from Jiangsu Province to the Hanzhuang Area; The Shandong Special Detective Team Is Tracking and Suppressing Them</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In the area where southern Shandong Province and Jiangsu Province meet, because the area is remote and transportation is inconvenient, bandits often appear. Although the Shandong Provincial authorities have repeatedly sent troops stationed in the area to search and suppress them, they move around, making it very difficult. Bandits often appear and harass the border areas, causing great harm to the local area. Yesterday (the 17th) at about 4:00 p.m., more than 30 bandits with complete firearms, all wearing plain clothes, fled from the Jiangsu border to the Hanzhuang area of Shandong Province. Coincidentally, there were three merchant ships on the lake, fully loaded with passengers and goods, passing through the area. The bandits immediately boarded the ships and forced the boatmen to drive to the vicinity of Chengzi Temple, and robbed a total of three merchant ships and kidnapped twenty or thirty men and women. Subsequently, the third special detective team leader Yan Yizhai, who was stationed in Nanyang Lake, received a report, and immediately led many detectives on a steel-plated boat to track them. When they sailed to the vicinity of Chengzi Temple, they were very close to the bandit ships. They immediately fired their guns, and after about two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and fled south. The detectives then recovered the three robbed merchant ships and all the kidnapped men and women. After the team leader questioned them about the kidnapping, Lang telegraphed the Jinan Special Detective Headquarters for a detailed report, and continued to track and pursue the fleeing bandits on the original ship. After receiving the report, the team leader Liu Yaoting immediately telegraphed the various detachments stationed in Jinan to immediately send more detectives to assist in the suppression. Liu Yaoting also believed that the bandits in the area had not yet been suppressed, so he took the Jinpu Train No. 21 to Jining at about 8:00 p.m. today (the 17th) and went to supervise the suppression in person. After the bandits are suppressed, he will also go to Zaozhuang. (April 18)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Holds Anti-Smoking Conference; Promotes a Four-Year Ban Plan; Government Hopes That People Will Work Together; Use Social Forces to Eliminate the Opium Poison</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: In order to understand the implementation of anti-smoking policies in various places and complete the four-year ban plan, the Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Committee held a meeting in the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce building at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, with anti-smoking committee members from various counties such as Yan Huiyu and Li Renzai attending, totaling more than 70 people. Li Jihong, the secretary of the Anti-Smoking Association, was sent to attend and guide. Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, Director Yu Min, Ye Xiufeng, Ye Chucang, Gu Ziyang, and Leng Yuqiu all attended. After the meeting, Zhou Houjun, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, reported the significance of convening the meeting and the future mission, roughly stating that he requested to obtain the situation after the implementation of the anti-smoking policies in various counties and the efficiency achieved, in order to discuss the methods to thoroughly eliminate opium poison in the future, and hoped that everyone would gather the power of social sanctions to supplement the lack of political power. Secondly, he reported the shortcomings of the anti-smoking policies in various counties and the methods for future improvement, and fulfilled the promise of a four-year ban. Secondly, Li Jihong, the representative of the General Association, reported Chairman Jiang's determination to ban drugs. Thirdly, Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government delivered a speech, roughly stating that Jiangsu's four-year ban on opium poison plan has passed 19 months. In the next two years, he hopes that everyone will work together. There are 300,000 smokers in Jiangsu. After the anti-smoking policy is completed, 300,000 smokers will become 300,000 strong men, and the annual financial resources will be at least 20 million to 40 million yuan more. To use such a large amount of manpower and financial resources to do business will not only make Jiangsu rich, but also make the country strong. Time is very urgent, and we cannot allow ourselves to be negligent for a moment. You are either local leaders or local gentry, and you should stand on the same front as the government, use social forces to eliminate the opium poison that harms the country and the people. Education and publicity have a great auxiliary effect on the anti-smoking policy. I hope you will also work hard to promote it. Thirdly, Gu Ziyang, the member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Director Yu Min delivered speeches. Yu said that there were about 310,000 smokers registered in Jiangsu in two instances, and more than 90,000 people have quit. Looking at the numbers, there has been considerable success. The mission in the future is even more important. I hope the conference will study it more. Thirdly, Ye Chucang gave a speech, roughly stating that the current tax is a period of government, people, and opium offenders fighting to the end. I hope to carry it through to the end, so that it can be banned in four years. Use the word "strict" to make opium offenders never be able to raise their heads. Thirdly, Zhang Yipeng gave a speech, hoping that the government will strive to make the equipment complete for poor people to quit smoking, and should carefully consider the lives of smokers, allocate a large sum of money to handle all anti-smoking matters, and on the other hand, use severe penalties and strict laws again, and there is absolute confidence in banning it in four years, etc. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 p.m., and the first meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. to discuss the proposals.</p>

<h3>Suzhou: Refugees and Villagers Fight</h3>
<p>In the Guo Xiang, Baodai Township, and Sheng Village areas of Suzhou, 193 refugees from Linqu County, Shandong Province, led by Wang Dechang, arrived at noon on the 19th. Because they were hungry, they took rice flour and other items from the farmers without permission, which aroused the anger of the farmers in the whole village, who held wooden sticks and other things and fought with the refugees. The refugees also showed no weakness, and the two sides fought fiercely, and the situation was very serious. Shen, the captain of the first detachment of the security team stationed in Chefang Township, learned about the incident, and together with Zhou, the police officer in charge of the police district, led ten policemen to rush to the scene to suppress the riot. At that time, the refugees stopped fighting when they saw the police team arriving.

At that time, the police team took the refugees to the airport outside the Shunmen, and took the refugee representatives Wang Dechang and Han Yingxiang into custody. The injured were sent to the county hospital for treatment. That night, the township head Fu Xuxing and others were summoned to the Panmen Outside Water Patrol Team headquarters to mediate.

<p>The villagers in the area near the Jiangdu Earthwork Project Office of the Jiangsu Construction Department rioted because of the land price issue, surrounding Shu Guohua, the director of the Construction Bureau and director of the office, injuring construction workers, and taking away the supervisor Ge Jiasheng and others.

Director Shu went to the province on the morning of the 19th to report on the riot. It is said that Shen, the director of the Construction Department, in addition to telegraphing the county government to issue a notice of persuasion regarding the villagers' coercion, also instructed Director Shu to rush back to the county and follow the county government to earnestly persuade them. If the villagers are again bewitched by others and act arbitrarily, they will be severely punished. The county government has now issued a notice in accordance with the order of the department head. However, some villagers came to the city on the morning of the 19th to petition. Later, Zhang Shu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, announced that the land price would be issued within days, and then they withdrew from the city.

<p>The first branch of the County Public Security Bureau is making every effort to implement the New Life Movement and rectify the appearance of the city. All kinds of vendors on the streets are banned. According to the local custom of this county, the chamber pots of various shops and households are usually emptied by people from the vegetable gardens inside and outside the city every morning, usually after 10:00 a.m. Since the previous day, the bureau has stipulated that the time for emptying chamber pots is from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. every morning, and those who are overdue will be confiscated, and vegetable gardens are prohibited from setting up stalls to sell vegetables on the streets. Therefore, the vegetable merchants cannot set up stalls to sell vegetables in the morning, and the time for emptying chamber pots is short, so they all went on strike and closed the market today (the 18th). There is not a single vegetable stand on the street, and all the chamber pots in the houses are full, and everyone looks worried. It is also heard.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Farmers Killed by Beating</h3>
<p>A tragic murder case occurred yesterday at Li Jiabang, south of Xingqiao, outside the East Gate. The details are as follows: The deceased, Yuan Alian, was 27 years old and his family was extremely poor. His wife, surnamed Chu, is 24 years old. He originally cultivated 10 mu of land in the urban area of Li's family. Since his father's death, he has owed rent rice for two years. He has gradually paid it back, but there is still a little left. The Li family relied on their power to force the land to be returned, and hired Wang Shenman from Wenzhou to cultivate it. At the beginning of spring ploughing, Wang, together with his worker A Ning, used a hoe to cut off the soybeans planted by Yuan Alian in the field yesterday afternoon. A'lian got the news and went to stop them, but unexpectedly touched their anger, and they started beating him. They hit him in the chest and ribs. The worker A Ning also followed suit as an accomplice. A'lian cried out miserably, but no one responded. Shenman tied A'lian's neck with a rope and dragged him desperately for about half a li. He was seen by the farmer Ma Qijie, who rushed to rescue him, but he was already dying. Although Qijie dragged him back to Yuan's house, he died shortly after. The deputy township head Yuan Jungong, who was the deceased's uncle, secretly reported to the police station, and the two criminals were arrested and sent to the court. The prosecutor Zhang Bing immediately led the police to the countryside for an autopsy. The autopsy found that the corpse was completely blue and purple, and it was indeed beaten to death before his death. The court opened a trial at 6:00 a.m. today. The two criminals looked extremely fierce and smiled calmly. The deceased's wife, Chu, cried uncontrollably, and everyone who saw it felt sorry for her.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony for the Houhuang Monument</h3>
<p>All education personnel and primary and secondary school students in the county raised more than 970 yuan to build a monument to commemorate the loyal martyrs Hou Tongzeng and Huang Chunyao, who were unyielding during the three massacres at the end of the Ming Dynasty, on the original site of the basketball court in Kuishan Park, in order to awaken national consciousness. The inscription on the monument has been written and carved in stone by Huang Shizuo. The model of the entire monument was made by Ling Junping, the inventor of the abacus. The Education Bureau convened representatives from various schools to hold a foundation stone laying ceremony at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, and construction began. It is scheduled to be completed within half a month, and a grand unveiling ceremony will be held in mid-May.</p>
<h3>A Bizarre Theft Occurs in the City</h3>
<p>On the night of the 5th, Dai Guanwu's house on Nandajie in the city was stolen a No. 1767 pistol, ten gold buttons, and a bunch of iron box keys without the door being opened. The situation was bizarre. The principal has reported it to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury of Principal at Qianmentang</h3>
<p>The house of Qin Zanwen, the former township head of Qianmentang Town in the fourth district, was broken into by more than ten mixed bandits carrying pistols at midnight on the 13th. They first cut off the urban and rural telephone lines and jumped in from the back door. Zanwen happened to be away from home, and the bandits injured his son Yiyan and ransacked the house, stealing clothing and legal tender worth a total of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: West Anhui Spring Tea on the Market</h3>
<p>The Huangya tea produced in western Anhui has always been famous and is known as the world along with the red tea in southern Anhui. Red tea can be sold abroad, and Huangya tea is only sold in Shandong Province, so its momentum is inferior to that of red tea. . This year, it was originally hoped that the tea trees in the Liuan area would grow vigorously and prosper, increasing production prospects. In the early spring, there was continuous rain and snow, and the weather was unusually cold, and the tea buds in the mountains suffered great damage, which affected the branches and leaves. Fortunately, the climate turned warm near Qingming, so they could flourish. However, the tea is dark, which is a sign of being cold. Now that Grain Rain is approaching, the tea farmers go to the mountains to pick and roast it, and then pick it again before putting it on the market, waiting for a good price to sell. Last year's market price was 3 yuan per basket, and the price was not high. However, due to the poor market conditions, most tea merchants suffered losses. It is feared that fewer people will go to transport it this spring than last year's enthusiasm. It is learned that some tea merchants from Shandong have already crossed the Bengbu River to set up a shop for buying and transporting. It is heard that there is still a lot of old tea in stock, so the market price is slightly lower than last spring at the beginning of the weighing. Because of the tea transportation relationship, the Changhuai shipping industry will also flourish.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Following the ceremonial rituals, Chairman Lu Jingshi delivered an opening speech, stating in brief: "Fellow representatives, today is the first day of Shanghai's Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week, and we are holding this propaganda conference to explain the significance of the government's determination to ban smoking. We hope that the people will cooperate with the government to work together to eradicate smoking and drugs. The harm of opium is well known to the people. It not only causes individuals to degenerate and families to go bankrupt, but it is also enough to destroy our country and exterminate our nation. We know that the national crisis is serious today, and to trace the cause of the national crisis, it was the Opium War. Because of the Opium War, unequal treaties were signed. Afterwards, various countries knew of our country's weakness and successively coerced our country into signing unequal treaties to bind us. The history of our country's anti-smoking efforts began with Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Liangguang during the Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, although there was also anti-smoking, the warlords were divided, and government orders were not enforced. They even protected opium as a way to make money, so there was little success. After the Nationalist Government established its capital in Nanjing, it followed Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug instructions and implemented anti-smoking. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also strictly formulated anti-smoking laws and vigorously implemented anti-smoking and anti-drug measures, deeply feeling that the country and nation could not be revived without eradicating smoking and drugs. The Nationalist Government's three-year anti-drug and six-year anti-smoking plans are also for this reason. Now the government has made the greatest determination and hopes that compatriots across the country will cooperate with the government to promote it together. It is also hoped that smokers across the country will understand the advantages and disadvantages and implement abstinence. Our country has now reached a critical moment of survival. If we want to save the national crisis, we must start by strengthening our bodies, because strengthening the body is the foundation of strengthening the country, and rejecting drugs and banning smoking are prerequisites for strengthening the body."</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>Following that, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, stating in brief: "China has a large land and population, ranking first in the world, but the weakness of the national physique is an undeniable fact. The reason for the weakening of the national physique is the large number of people who are addicted to opium, willingly heading towards the path of suicide. Even with just cigarettes, the annual losses are great. A single spark can start a prairie fire. I hope that everyone here will do their best to promote this." Then, Dai Lizhen delivered a speech, stating in brief: "The significance of anti-smoking has been thoroughly explained by Chairman and Mr. Wang. I am a representative of the Public Security Bureau, and this bureau is the agency for implementing anti-smoking measures, so I would like to briefly explain the registration procedures. There are 100,000 smokers in this city, but only over 30,000 have registered with this bureau. Several thousand have already quit smoking, totaling about 40,000, only accounting for one-third of the total. Now the government is magnanimous and is re-registering. Those who have already registered have started to receive licenses. I sincerely hope that smokers will register as soon as possible and avoid being misled." Then, Mayor Wu's representative, Zhang Yuanruo, delivered a speech, stating in brief: "The significance of anti-smoking lies in the revival of the nation. To go a step further, it lies in eliminating the national crisis. The method of anti-smoking should start with reforming our lives, because the majority of our people have irregular lives. Therefore, the method of anti-smoking should start on the one hand with passive anti-smoking and on the other hand with actively reforming our lives." Huang Zaoxiong then delivered a speech, stating in brief: "Anti-smoking is an important plan for saving the country, a prerequisite for reviving the nation. Anti-smoking is an essential element for creating family happiness. Anti-smoking is a method for personal survival." Zhou Xuexiang delivered a speech stating in brief, "To live, one must ban smoking; to be healthy, one must reject drugs; to save the country, one must also implement anti-smoking." Finally, Zhang Shengcai delivered a speech, stating in brief: "The National Anti-Drug Association has investigated the national smoking and drug statistics as follows: In Yunnan, people, men, women, old and young, all smoke opium. Even newborn babies are addicted to smoking and drugs. In the 20 war-torn counties, smoking and drugs are rampant, which is extremely tragic. Some smokers even sell their blood when they have no money to smoke, at 20 yuan per pound, because their blood contains toxic substances. Smokers across the country account for 3% of the total population, totaling 15 million people. On average, each person smokes for 3 jiao per day, costing 4.5 million yuan per day, with annual losses reaching 1.6 billion yuan."</p>
<p>Slogans and Posters</p>
<p>(Slogans) "Everyone rise up and eradicate smoking and drugs!" "Support Director-General Chiang's anti-smoking efforts!" "Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party!" "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live the Republic of China!" (Posters) "Smokers who request to quit smoking do not have to spend money." "Opium pills and morphine needles are poisonous substances that destroy the body, bankrupt the family, destroy the country, and exterminate the race."

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Held Emergency Executive Committee Meeting; Someone Pretended to Be from the Chamber to Investigate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held two temporary emergency meetings to discuss how to deal with the matter of someone pretending to be from the Chamber to investigate the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, the Chamber held a temporary emergency meeting. The attendees included Chairman Yu Zuoting, Executive Committee members Xu Jilong, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, and Ma Jiliang. First, the Chairman reported that Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing had allegedly pretended to be the Chairman to investigate the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, attaching two pieces of evidence and requesting a thorough investigation. It was resolved that if this matter was true, it should be dealt with strictly according to the law. However, for the sake of prudence, the Supervisory Committee was asked to investigate the facts thoroughly before further action was taken.</p>
<p>Second Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday (20th) at 2:00 PM, the Chamber held another temporary emergency meeting. The attendees included the Chairman and all Executive Committee members, discussing the case reported in the newspapers today that Zhang Rongchu had failed in managing the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and had issued a public notice explaining the causes and consequences.

<p>After receiving the resolution of the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Committee will convene a meeting to discuss the matter. The Supervisory Committee members are Fang Jiaobo, Du Yuesheng, Pei Yunqing, Shen Tianxin, Chen Ziming, and others.</p>
<h3>Opposing Anhui Province's Monopoly on Qimen Tea Foreign Tea Firms Decide to Suspend Exchange Yesterday Morning, Petitioning the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for Assistance The Chamber of Commerce Sends Urgent Telegram to Anhui Province to Adopt Opinions and Exert Every Effort to Urge Postponement of the Suspension Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association, opposing the Anhui Provincial Government's monopoly on the transportation and sale of Qimen tea, placing tea firms in a desperate situation, decided at a general meeting the day before yesterday to suspend exchange from today. Yesterday morning, they petitioned the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for assistance. In addition to urging a postponement of the suspension deadline, the Chamber of Commerce sent an urgent telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government to adopt the tea firms' opinions. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tea Industry Demands</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Firms Association, in response to the Anhui Provincial Government's monopoly on the transportation and sale of Qimen tea, put forward four demands: The sales team should be composed mainly of managers of various firms, and all office staff should be transferred from various firms. Commissions should still be drawn at 2%, as in the past. When tea boxes are transported to Shanghai, the bill of lading must be immediately handed over to the sales team so that tea samples can be extracted to avoid delaying market opportunities. All economic matters related to sales should be handled directly by this team. They sent representatives Sun Zifu, Zhuo Huapu, Zhuo Jingcheng, and others to Anhui to present their views to the Finance and Construction Departments. The two department heads completely accepted, with the tea being transported by the government and the sales office organized by the firms, entirely managed by the firms, with no government interference. The representatives were satisfied, reported back to Shanghai, and submitted a request for instructions from the Anhui Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Decision to Suspend Exchange</p>
<p>The association believes that six days have passed since the submission of the request for instructions to the Anhui Provincial Government, and there has been no reply. However, the Anhui Provincial Committee is forcing various tea shops in Qimen to register and is transferring government funds to those who have already received firm funds. The accounts are unclear. Furthermore, Anhui officials once told the three representatives that since the matter had been settled, the government would not release funds, only to renege on their promise soon after, depriving us of our rights without leaving anything behind. Each industry is a legitimate organization with a history of seventy or eighty years, raising large sums of money to lend to tea shops in order to pursue a tenth of the profit. Since the Anhui Construction Department proposed a method for transporting and selling Qimen tea at the National Economic Conference, the association believed that it was similar to a monopoly and telegraphed the central leadership and the Anhui government. Subsequently, they received a sensitive telegram from the Economic Commission relayed by the Chamber of Commerce, stating that it was only approved in principle, but the unemployment and debts of tea merchants (i.e., tea firms) must be taken into account, and it was not a monopoly on Qimen tea. The Anhui government's winter telegram only stated that the transportation and sale were being studied and were not a monopoly, and the lending of funds to tea firms should not be doubted. For these reasons, they proceeded to lend over a million yuan to the Qimen side. Now that large sums of money have been lent out, the Anhui Provincial Government suddenly imposed a monopoly on transportation and sale, seizing transportation and sales, and handling funds. This not only affects the tea firms but also eats away at their profits and controls their fate. Tea firms are tea-selling agencies that have already advanced funds for tea but are unable to sell it. The injustice is so great that there is no way to appeal. The three representatives, in desperation, sought a compromise as a last resort, but it is still the same. All tea firms are in mortal fear. Today, Qimen tea is monopolized; tomorrow, Wutun tea and Pingshui tea will be monopolized, and they will all perish together. They have no choice but to suspend the exchange of all arriving drafts from various places from the 21st onwards in order to save their capital. Those who have not seen the drafts will also not sign them, pending a resolution. If any colleagues privately exchange or sign, the association will not recognize them as members. If tea shops have funds deposited in tea firms, this is another matter and will of course be exchanged to show fairness.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Persuasion</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Foreign Tea Firms Association sent representatives Chen Yizhou, Hong Mengpan, Sun Zifu, Zhuo Huapu, Ye Shichang, Ye Jingqi, Peng Zhiping, Jiang Chuitao, Wu Naibai, Xu Zhenhua, and others to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to petition, stating that the Anhui Provincial Government monopolized the transportation and sale of Qimen tea and the resolution of the emergency meeting on April 19 to suspend the exchange from the 21st. Secretary Yan Esheng received them and stated that tea is an export product and is of great importance to international trade. Please postpone the suspension deadline. The Chamber will telegraph the Yuan, Bu, and Provincial Governments to adopt the tea industry's demands. The representatives were satisfied and agreed to postpone for two days.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram to Anhui Province</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce urgently telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government, stating, "Urgent, To the Anhui Provincial Government, The monopoly on the transportation and sale of Qimen tea places tea firms in a desperate situation. The Foreign Tea Firms Association of Shanghai sent three representatives, Sun, Zhuo, and others, to pay a visit and request relief, and four opinions were put forward, which were accepted. However, it has been reported that the Red Tea Transportation and Sales Association is actually releasing funds to tea shops that have already received funds from tea firms. The tea firms in this city were shocked upon hearing this and convened an emergency meeting of colleagues on the 19th of this month, deciding that from the 21st of this month, all tea firms will suspend the exchange of all arriving drafts from various places for both red and green tea, and those who have not seen the drafts will not sign them. Our association, considering the urgency of the situation and the great importance to the tea [character missing], immediately advised against it, and it was agreed that the aforementioned resolution would be postponed for two days to allow for a solution. If there is still no fair solution to follow within two days, the more funds the tea firms lend, the greater the losses will be. The authorities who love farmers and merchants would never be willing to do this. Therefore, we urgently telegraph to present the four opinions submitted by the three representatives and request that they be ordered to be followed in order to maintain the livelihood of the tea firms, which are on the verge of extinction. The telegram is urgent and awaiting a reply. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully, [character missing]."</p>
<h3>Amidst Smuggling Rumors, National Sugar's Stagnant Sales Affect Shipping Industry; Only One-Third of Cargo Transported Between Shanghai and Tianjin; Companies Discuss Collecting Freight in Cash</h3>
<p>Amidst the growing rumors of smuggling in the north, Shanghai's shipping industry has also been severely hit. Various shipping companies are negotiating rescue measures. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>National Sugar Unable to Be Sold</p>
<p>Since Guangdong National Sugar was transported to Shanghai, it should have been sold well across the country due to its tax-free preferential treatment. However, in reality, the opposite has happened. Although a lot of Guangdong sugar has arrived in Shanghai, the way out is greatly hindered, and it is stored in warehouses, like mountains. Later arrivals have no place to store. According to Mr. Zheng Zenan, who is engaged in the National Sugar industry, the main point of the blow to the sales of Guangdong sugar is the smuggled sugar in the North. In the corner of the North alone, smuggled sugar reaches 7 million dan per year, which averages more than 600,000 dan per month. If the authorities do not use effective measures to stop it, then National Sugar is difficult to expect to improve.</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Severely Affected</p>
<p>Northern shipping, except for the goods accumulated when the ice river was unfrozen, has had a slightly better business period due to the rush loading of various merchant ships. As usual, every spring, all goods are started to be purchased, and the shipping rates of navigation ships can also improve. The situation is very different this spring. In the past month, the incoming and outgoing goods between Shanghai and Tianjin have fallen to the extreme, only reaching one-third of the past years. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau has reduced to two ships, struggling to sail. The Sanbei Company planned to resume the Shanghai-Tianjin voyage, but has not sent ships because there is no cargo to transport and there is no loss at all. The fundamental reason is that smuggled goods are sold smoothly in the north.</p>
<p>Reduce Freight Rates and Collect Cash</p>
<p>Therefore, the various shipping companies in this port have specially agreed to reduce the added shipping rate to Tianjin by 40% (originally, there were very few outgoing goods from Shanghai). The companies are currently discussing that the freight from Shanghai to Tianjin and other places will be collected in cash, and no longer recorded in the account. At the same time, the Tianjin shipping industry is even more so because this year's business has plummeted, and the tonnage tax paid to the Wusong Merchant Ship School is determined to be stopped. A telegram has been sent to the Shanghai shipping merchants to unanimously submit to the ministry to request exemption.</p>

<p>Since his assumption of office, the Shanghai Municipal Police Chief Cai Jingjun has worked extremely hard to promote the New Life Movement. Given the complexity of Shanghai's environment and the deeply ingrained habits of its citizens, achieving ideal goals has not been fully realized. However, the results of a year's effort have undeniably improved the cleanliness and order of the northern and southern districts, earning praise from both Chinese and foreign observers. To ensure that the police force fully understands the significance of labor service in the New Life Movement, receives adequate training, and that citizens understand the police force's attitude towards promoting the New Life Movement, following the first labor service mobilization on March 20th, involving over two thousand police officers and directing various branch bureaus and teams to dispatch more officers to participate in the ongoing district cleaning campaigns.

<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese Organize Fatherland Sightseeing Group; Scheduled to Return to China Next Month and Arrive in Shanghai; Sightseeing in Beijing-Hankou-Pingjin (Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin) and Other Places</h3>

Participants are all overseas Chinese youths, with a group of thirty to forty members. They are scheduled to depart on the French Shipping Company's ship "Chizidanieru" on the first of next month, arrive in Hong Kong on the twelfth for a one-day stay, and then continue north via Xiamen, arriving in Shanghai on the sixteenth.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchant Qiu Yujin Contacts National Goods Promotion; Visiting Various National Goods Factories in Shanghai These Days</h3>
<p>Qiu Yujin, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant from Nanbang Port, Sumatra, Dutch East Indies (Nanyang), recently returned to China. After visiting Guangdong and Beijing, he met with central overseas Chinese affairs authorities and the Minister of Industry, and investigated the current situation of domestic industries. Mr. Qiu is currently staying in Shanghai for several days to complete his mission. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Mr. Qiu at the hotel. According to him, during his stay in Shanghai, he received warm hospitality from various organizations such as the International Trade Bureau, the China National Industrial Foreign Trade Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, and was introduced to major factories for visits. He expressed his deep gratitude. He now feels that domestic factories are able to use new-style machinery and produce excellent products, which are comparable to those of Europe and the United States. However, in terms of designs, decorations, and illustrations, they seem to be not entirely suitable for the Dutch East Indies market and should be improved. The reason for my return to China this time is to introduce national goods to foreign countries for promotion, so that the sales of national goods will become more and more widespread. I have now collected more than a thousand kinds of samples. When I return to Batavia, I will exhibit these more than a thousand kinds of samples at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce there. Now Shanghai factories are planning to organize an inspection team, which can depart around July. When they arrive in Batavia, they can sign contracts and order goods. I have already informed the Batavia Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in advance and asked Consul General Song to notify all overseas Chinese organizations to hold a meeting to prepare a warm welcome. In order to facilitate the reception, thirty outstanding students have been selected to serve as translators.</p>

<p>Mr. Huang is scheduled to go to Nanjing and other places for investigation. According to the New Voice News Agency, the Overseas Chinese Federation hosted a banquet at Jinlong Restaurant yesterday at noon to welcome Huang Chaolong, President of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies (Nanyang), Lin Guichi, Zheng Chaofan, etc. Lin Die, Liu Chengcan, Huang Jianzhong, Xie Nanguang, Zhang Xiqi, Xie Denan, Peng Shengfu, and Yang Lishu, representative of the China Chemical Industry Society, Le Bin, manager of Taikang Canned Food Company, and other thirty people attended. Chairman Lin Die delivered a welcome speech. Xie Denan and Liu Chengcan delivered reports successively. Then Mr. Huang delivered a speech of thanks. Methods for promoting national goods to Nanyang were discussed on the spot. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, today our association welcomes Mr. Huang Chaolong. We are very pleased that representatives from various factories are attending and discussing the issue of national goods with us. Because President Li Fulin has not yet arrived in Shanghai, I will represent him. I apologize if the reception is not adequate. Mr. Huang has a long-standing reputation in the Surabaya business community. His return to China this time is to promote the sales of national goods to Nanyang, which is worthy of our welcome. Xie Denan and Liu Chengcan will report. Mr. Huang's ancestors were engaged in business in Surabaya, and their credibility was outstanding. When Mr. Huang took over and expanded the old business, progress was made by leaps and bounds. Today, he is considered a leader by the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's Response</p>
<p>I am very grateful for the welcome from the gentlemen of the Overseas Chinese Federation today, which I really do not deserve. I would like to briefly mention a few points based on my observations for the consideration of the gentlemen:</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies hold the commercial rights there. Europeans who go to Nanyang to do business cannot negotiate transactions with the natives without the mediation of the overseas Chinese. Therefore, whether overseas Chinese collect scattered local products in various villages and transport them to ports such as Surabaya for sale to foreign firms and export to European and American countries, or transport various crafts from various countries and sell them to the natives through the hands of overseas Chinese, they can earn one-tenth of the profit.</p>
<p>Since the invasion of Japanese forces, wherever the overseas Chinese set foot, the Japanese have followed suit. As a result, Japanese goods are imported into the Dutch East Indies without the need for overseas Chinese. Japanese small businessmen directly trade with the natives. As a result, more and more overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are unemployed.</p>
<p>The Dutch government has always suspected that there are quite a few radical elements among our overseas Chinese, fearing that they may have political effects, and has taken strict precautions. Until recently, it realized that the invasion of Japanese forces is not only economic, but also has political effects, which is very different from the overseas Chinese's mere pursuit of local prosperity and commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, we must restore the important position that overseas Chinese held in Nanyang in the past and develop the domestic industry, which all depend on the practical cooperation and rapid catch-up of the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad. I hope that the industrialists in this port will not hesitate to give their advice. It is a great honor.</p>
<p>Visiting Various Places</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's return to China this time is to investigate the domestic industry and contact various manufacturers in this city to discuss methods for promoting national goods to Nanyang. Therefore, it has been discussed on the spot, and he will also contact the China National Goods Production and Sales Trade Association in the coming days. Taikang Company and China Chemical Industry Society, etc., are also planning for Mr. Huang to visit today. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, Mr. Huang also plans to go to Nanjing and other places for investigation.</p>

<h3>For Silver Management Rules, the Silver Industry Guild Held a General Meeting Yesterday; There Are Indeed Difficulties in the Fact That Chemical Silverware, Please the Ministry of Finance to Temporarily Suspend the Execution Before Resolving</h3>
<p>The Silver Industry Guild held a general meeting of all members yesterday to discuss the silver management rules. More than 100 members including Shan Hexuan, Yuan Guoxiang, and Sun Bing attended. Chairman Yuan Xingzhi reported that the Ministry of Finance issued silver management rules last year, restricting the use of chemical silver to make utensils, and only allowing the addition of 30% silver when necessary. However, chemical silver is hard, brittle, and easy to break. Adding 30% silver is also too hard and cannot withstand the hammer. Although repeated tests have been carried out, it cannot be made into ornaments. The deadline is approaching in a blink of an eye. If pure silver is used for manufacturing again, it will be no different from violating the punishment regulations that are about to be promulgated. Therefore, our industry has reached the critical point of survival, and a practical remedy should be discussed. Then Yuan Hongjun, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave guidance. Then it was resolved that (1) a petition delegation will be organized to request relief from higher authorities; (2) the date of the petition will be determined by the executive committee; (3) before the silver management rules are resolved by petition and amendment, please ask the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend the execution; (4) if necessary, the carpenters, engravers, and other seven parts will jointly petition as main workers; (5) send a circular to fellow industries in various ports to proceed in unison. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Exchanging Silver for Legal Tender is May 3rd</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously approved the request from remote provinces to extend the deadline for exchanging silver for legal tender to May 3rd. The deadline is now approaching. In the future, those who continue to use silver coins, or use silver as a general currency, or buy and sell silver for profit, will be dealt with in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Offenses Against the National Currency, which will be passed by the Legislative Yuan this week. The regulations impose severe penalties on those who use or buy and sell silver, including confiscation of the silver and imprisonment. The authorities hope that those who still have silver should exchange it for legal tender before May 3rd to avoid losses and imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Case Heard; One Case Sentenced Yesterday; 50 Days of Detention with Probation Granted; Another Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 27th</h3>
<p>A major dispute occurred at the Maigen Road rickshaw driver registration office on the 14th of this month. Police officers, including Chinese Chief Detective Tao Shiwei, were injured by rickshaw drivers. Eleven people, including Luan Fusheng, were arrested at the time. Another fifteen people, including Feng Wanxiang, who had robbed rickshaw drivers of their armbands, were also arrested by the police. Luan Fusheng and the other ten were prosecuted by police lawyer Zhang Tianyin for obstructing official duties and causing injury. Feng Wanxiang and the other fourteen were prosecuted by police lawyer Qian Xunjiu for restricting freedom. The Luan case was adjourned by the First Special Court. The Feng case was concluded yesterday morning. Judge Fu Lin ruled that Feng Wanxiang, Zhao Bao'an, Chen Xijiang, Zhou Chenglin, Yang Wulin, Yang Xuelong, Wu Yubiao, Bao Zuogui, Hua Busheng, Chou Shunrong, Bao Shuangquan, Zhou Youcai, Zai Mingchang, Dong Dechun, and Mei Xuewu were each sentenced to fifty days of detention, with two years of probation. The Luan Fusheng case was heard by Judge Tan in the Eighth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang withdrew the charge of injury and prosecuted only for obstructing official duties. Chinese Chief Detective Tao Shiwei, who had recovered from his injuries, appeared in court and testified about the incident. After hearing the testimony of the defendants, the court scheduled the sentencing for the 27th.</p>
<h3>Li Jinhui's Song and Dance Troupe's Loan Case Continues; Li Claims Remaining Funds Were Not Received; Responsibility for Breach Should Not Be Borne by Him</h3>
<p>Li Jinhui, the head of the Bright Moon Song and Dance Troupe, entered into a loan agreement with the Nanyang Chunqiu Company in the winter of 1934. The Chunqiu Company loaned Li 5,000 yuan for costumes and 2,500 yuan for travel expenses. The Bright Moon Troupe was required to perform in Nanyang. In addition to repaying the loan from ticket sales, the Chunqiu Company was also to share a portion of the profits. Chen Xiaodie acted as guarantor for the agreement. Because Li did not fulfill the agreement, the Chunqiu Company commissioned Hu Guigeng to file a lawsuit against Chen Xiaodie in the First Special District Court, seeking to enforce the guarantee. The First Special Court summoned Chen Xiaodie once. Chen Xiaodie argued that Li's failure to go to Nanyang was because the plaintiff did not pay the travel expenses in full, and that Li did not intentionally breach the agreement. The plaintiff insisted that all payments had been made. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. The circumstances were reported in the April 8th issue of this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Twelfth Civil Court. Hu Guigeng stated that after paying 5,000 yuan at the time of signing the agreement, Lang Jingshan subsequently paid Li 1,200 yuan, and the remaining 1,300 yuan was paid to Li on May 8th. Lang Jingshan testified that he had indeed paid 1,200 yuan to Li Jinhui. Li Jinhui then stated that he had only received 5,000 yuan for costumes and 1,200 yuan from Lang. He had not received the remaining 1,300 yuan, so he was not in breach of the agreement. The plaintiff should be responsible for the breach. Moreover, this was a personal matter, and Chen Xiaodie was only a guarantor. The plaintiff should have listed him as the first defendant and it was unfair to sue only the guarantor. The court advised both parties to settle the matter amicably, but they could not reach an agreement. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested that Li be added as a defendant. The court ordered an adjournment for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Maid Runs Away; Mistress Accused of Abuse; Incident Occurred in the Extraterritorial Road Construction Area</h3>
<p>Zhu Yonghe, from Hangzhou, who runs a coal mine, and his wife, Shi, reside at No. 92, Gugucun, No. 361, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. In June of last year, they bought a 15-year-old Anhui girl, Hang Cuier, as a maid for ten yuan. On April 12th of this year, Zhu and Shi believed that Hang's character was questionable and that she had stolen one yuan in legal tender. They and Shi's brother, Shi Songshan, used wooden rulers and feather dusters to beat her severely. The next day, the girl, unable to endure the abuse, ran away on her own. While walking through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hart Road, she was spotted by Chinese police officer No. 2824, who took her to the police station. After learning about what happened, he sent Hang to the First Special Court. Judge Ye temporarily sent her to the Women and Children's Relief Association. Zhu, Shi, and Shi Songshan were separately prosecuted by the police. Yesterday morning, the Jing'an Temple Police Station requested the First Special Court to issue a summons for Zhu, Shi, and Shi Songshan to appear in the Eighth Criminal Court, charging them with abusing a girl under the age of sixteen under Article 286 of the Criminal Code. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, on the night of April 11th, the defendant, Zhu, noticed that one yuan in legal tender was missing. Later it was found in the space between the boxes, it was determined that it was stolen by Hang Cuier. The next morning, they dragged Hang to a small room and beat her with wooden boards. Shi Songshan struck her with a feather duster. The girl then escaped on her own. She first stayed overnight at the home of a woman named A Ying at No. 8, Dapengfang, Hart Road. But after Hang ran away, Zhu sent the female servant Wang Zhu to look for her. On Hart Road, the woman found her and insisted on taking her home, but she refused.</p>
<p>Shouting on the way, the Chinese police took her to the police station and sent Hang to the Red Cross Society, where it was confirmed that she had minor injuries on her buttocks and legs, etc. According to Hang Cuier, she is fifteen years old, named Yuesheng, born in the year of the dog, originally from Anhui. Her mother died early, and her father was serving in the army, so in June of last year, she went to Kazikou to find her father. Unexpectedly, she encountered kidnappers. In Wuhu, she was sold to Zhu's cook for forty yuan and went to Shanghai via Nanjing to work as a maid. She has been beaten three times in total. This time, the lady of the house (i.e., Zhu)</p>
<p>Accused me of stealing money and together with her young uncle (i.e., Shi Hangshan) beat me severely with wooden boards and feather dusters, etc. Zhu stated that Hang Cuier was adopted as her daughter and had repeatedly stolen money and she had never scolded her. This time she stole one yuan in legal tender again, and it was found on her.</p>
<p>She was slightly rebuked. Shi Songshan said that he used to work as a clerk at the Jinsheng Money Shop in Zhenjiang and had just come to Shanghai on March 2nd to visit his sister. He admitted to the beating and hired a lawyer to defend him in court. Judge Tan, after examining the evidence, ruled that the location of the incident was in an extraterritorial road construction area and should be handled by the District Court. Zhu and Shi were each released on bail and ordered to report to the Shanghai District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Pujiang Robbery Cracked; Both People and Loot Recovered; To Be Sent to Court Today</h3>
<p>Yang Jinfu, the branch boatman of the Chen Jiangji Barge Company, moored his barge outside the China Soap Factory pier in Yangshupu on the night of the 16th of this month to wait overnight to load soap the next day. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM on the 17th, a sampan came from the shore and approached Yang's boat. Five robbers jumped out. Three of them entered the front and back cabins and tied up several crew members. Then, they entered the back cabin and threatened Yang and his wife, Zhou, with knives, demanding that they hand over 2,000 yuan in cash and five gold rings. When Yang and the others replied that they did not have these items, they were stabbed several times. Yang was stabbed twice in the shoulder and arm, and Zhou was stabbed three times. Their clothes were covered in blood. The robbers searched them at will and robbed them of cotton-padded and unlined clothing and ornaments worth more than 200 yuan. They then boarded the original sampan, landed, and fled. The incident was reported to the Customs Water Police Station, and the two injured people were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, Chinese police officer No. 572 of the Public Concession Yangshupu Police Station apprehended a person carrying a package on Yangshupu Road. Because he gave evasive answers, he was taken to the police station. He confessed that the items were stolen from Yang's boat. After dawn, the Water Police Station was notified to take the suspect back. He confessed that his name was Zhao Mingshan, 26 years old, from Tongzhou. He used to be a barge captain. He claimed that Cai Zaifu and Xiaoquan Lin had initiated the robbery. Detectives from the police station went to the Juxing Tea Garden on Zhabei Road, Hongkou, and arrested Cai. He claimed that he did not know about the robbery, but that Xing Shunqing, who used to work as a captain on Yang Jinfu's boat, and Shi Sanlang, who used to work as a captain on Chen Jiangji's barge, and another unemployed crew member, Wang Miaofa, had asked him to join the robbery, but he did not participate. After obtaining this clue, the detectives searched in all directions and arrested Shi and Wang on the days before yesterday. They confessed that Xing Maoqing, who was at large, was the mastermind. After the robbery, they threw the knives and the heavy stolen goods, such as a gramophone, into the river to escape. The detectives then recovered all of the stolen goods and took Ge Aqiao, the sampan man No. 3550, who had not reported the incident, along with the sampan, to the police station. This morning, the suspects and the two injured plaintiffs will be sent to the District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhou Chunbo's Son Kidnapped; Two Accomplices Arrested; Pretended to Represent the Victim to Negotiate in Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Shanghai police have not yet learned the details of the kidnapping of Zhou Chunbo's fourth son, Jiasheng, at No. 135, Pubofang, Luban Road, French Concession. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. After Zhou's nanny, Jin Zhou, took the young master out, Zhao Jin, a relative of the nanny, pretended to visit Zhou's family to comfort them and offered to help find the child's whereabouts. Little did they know that the woman was also an accomplice of the kidnappers, secretly inquiring about information from the Zhou family and reporting it to her accomplices. Zhao Jin then introduced Lu Ren, Zhenwu (also known as Guangming, 30 years old, from Shaoxing), to represent the Zhou family in negotiating the ransom. On the 16th, Lu Zhenwu, entrusted by Zhou, took 80 yuan, ham, and wine and traveled by boat to Zhenhai, claiming to be negotiating. He spent a week sightseeing and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 18th. At this time, the case had already been solved in Shanghai, but Lu was unaware. However, Lu's movements had been secretly followed by detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhong Benchang, and Dai Rongji of the French Police Station. When Lu arrived at Zhou's house to report on the negotiations in Ningbo, the detectives immediately arrested Lu and Zhao Jin (also known as Su Lan, 43 years old). They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that there were still accomplices in the case being investigated in the First Special Court and requested an adjournment to be tried together after the accomplices' case was submitted. Lu Zhenwu and Zhao Jin both stated that although they represented the Zhou family in negotiating with the bandits, they had no conspiracy and requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhang Chaozuo ordered them to be remanded in custody and granted an adjournment to be tried together on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<h3>North Bridge and Qianliang Temple Held Market Fairs Yesterday; Goods Piled Up and Villagers Swarmed; Trading and Returning, Each Getting What They Wanted</h3>
<p>North Bridge and Qianliang Temple in Shanghai County (both along the Shanghai-Minhang section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway) traditionally hold large open-air markets on the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, which villagers call festival markets. Yesterday, the two festival markets opened simultaneously as scheduled. Most of the goods were agricultural tools, such as iron tools such as hoes, shovels, plows, rakes, knives, and axes, and household items made of bamboo and wood. Various stalls occupied almost all of the open space in the two market streets. Farmers from the surrounding villages raised funds to come to the market, wandering around and choosing what they needed. The crowd was no less than 30,000 to 40,000 people, which was a grand occasion. The North Bridge Pingshan People's Education Museum took advantage of the opportunity to show various educational films. The audience was very crowded. These markets traditionally last for three days, so they will end tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Convened the Third Meeting with the Film Industry Yesterday; Decided to Cooperate with the Film Industry on Three Principles</h3>
<p>The Central Party Department's Propaganda Department convened the third meeting with film company executives yesterday at the Shanghai Municipal Government Conference Hall. More than 30 representatives from companies such as Star, Lianhua, Xinhua, Yihua, Tianyi, Yueming Kuailelin, Jixing, and Shanghai attended, including Wen Jianyun, Zhang Shichuan, Luo Mingyou, Zhang Shankun, Ouyang Yuqian, Yan Youxiang, and Shao Cunren. From the central government, Deputy Minister Fang Zhi, Secretary Chuan Qixue, Director Zhang Beihai, Chairman of the Film Inspection Committee Luo Gang, and other committee members of the Central Cultural Planning Committee Ma Yuanfang, and the Central Script Review Committee Gan Yugeng, etc., as well as representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Pan Gongzhan and the Municipal Government Li Dachao. Deputy Minister Fang presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating in brief that this was the third time the Central Propaganda Department had convened a meeting with film industry representatives. In the past year, there had been very few opportunities for central comrades engaged in the film industry to meet with everyone. He hoped that they would exchange ideas as much as possible to promote the effect of division of labor and cooperation. In the past year, the Central Propaganda Department had been thinking about how to assist the film industry in developing the film business. He was sure the film industry colleagues felt the same. The central government was apologetic about the results of the previous two meetings because it could not completely fulfill the hopes of the film industry colleagues. On the other hand, the central authorities were comforted by the fact that after meeting with everyone twice, they were able to understand the actual situation of the film industry and were able to do their best to assist in the development and convenience of the film industry. He hoped that everyone would express their opinions based on actual facts and that the central government would accept and consider them as the basis for future joint efforts between the central government and the film industry. Shanghai Municipal Party Committee representative Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, and the Central Propaganda Department's Film Affairs Department, the Central Film Inspection Committee, the Central Script Review Committee, the Central Cultural Affairs Planning Committee, and representatives of various film companies reported. They had lunch and took photos at the Municipal Government at noon and continued the meeting in the afternoon, discussing many proposals. Finally, regarding the future central style of domestic films, three principles were decided as follows:  Promote national consciousness to fulfill the mission of safeguarding national defense with films.  Carefully select film themes that are technically suitable for the times to promote the effectiveness of film education during times of national crisis.  The realistic depiction of film plots should fully assist in the promotion of the New Life Movement. At 5:00 PM, more than a dozen attendees from various companies proposed a toast to the revival of the Chinese nation and the health of the leader, and then the meeting adjourned. The result was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu Xuefan, a member of the Central Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and director of the Dagong News Agency, recently received an order from the central government to attend the 20th International Labour Conference as a representative of China. Mr. Zhu has been very busy with farewell banquets from various circles in recent days. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, he attended a farewell banquet held by colleagues from the Dagong News Agency.

<h3>National Radio Stations to Broadcast Central Programs; The Executive Yuan Orders Provincial and Municipal Governments to Comply; To Be Implemented from 8:00 PM Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office believes that the broadcasting range of the Central Radio Station can reach Southeast Asia, the United States, and Australia. It has been tirelessly improving the programs, sparing no effort. In addition to publicizing Party principles and politics, it focuses on adult education, children's education, and promotes noble entertainment and moral cultivation, in order to prevent the public from being corrupted by low-level entertainment and to catch up with European and American radio stations. Recently, in order to unify the propaganda steps, it presented a report to the Central Executive Committee, which forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, ordering the broadcasting stations to uniformly broadcast the programs of the Central Radio Station from 8:00 PM to 9:05 PM (except Sundays) from yesterday onwards. It is now learned that the programs will temporarily be brief news, current affairs reviews, celebrity speeches, academic speeches, and dramas of great value. In the future, they will gradually be improved so that the people of the country can be edified. The local radio stations will reduce the difficulty and cost of recruiting programs. However, private radio stations without broadcasting equipment should temporarily suspend broadcasting during this period to avoid differences, so that will is concentrated and effectiveness is achieved quickly. The people of the country, no matter how far or near, even if they only have simple crystal radios or one or two vacuum tubes, can enjoy high-quality programs at a very low cost.</p>

<h3>Convenient Access to Yu Mountain; Special Boats Available for Direct Travel</h3>
<p>Huafeng Third, was originally a famous scenic spot in Songyi, and among the nine peaks, Yu Mountain is the best. Firstly, Yu Mountain has two mountains, East and West, linked together. Secondly, West Yu Mountain has both natural scenery and a Catholic church built on it, which is extremely solemn. The scenery is naturally special. However, transportation from Shanghai to Yu Mountain has always been inconvenient. Now that the motor road from Shanghai to Sijing has been opened, the company has specially prepared two small boats at the Zhuanqiao Station near Sijing, which will travel exclusively to Yu Mountain, with a total of twelve round trips per day, to facilitate tourists. It is now between spring and summer, with pleasant weather and warm sunshine. In addition, the Marian month is approaching. It will be doubly convenient for literati or religious believers to go to the mountain.</p>
<h3>The New Taicang Daily to be Revived</h3>
<p>The New Taicang Daily was the only publication of young Taicang natives residing outside their hometown ten years ago. Its principles were pure, its arguments were fair, and it contributed greatly to the local area, earning it the respect of society. However, it ceased publication more than seven years ago due to a lack of leadership. Now, former members of the newspaper, including Di Junwu, Qian HaoCheng, Shen Boli, He Yuanming, Gu Yinqian, Wu Jingwen, Gu Yanbin, Ye Zhengong, Ye Bingruo, and others, believe it is necessary to revive it. Therefore, they held a luncheon at the Jinlong Restaurant on Xizang Road in Shanghai on the 19th of this month to discuss the matter. Those present included Di Junwu, Cui Yanbing, Qian HaoCheng, He Yuanming, Shen Boli, Zhu Shoutong, and fourteen others. Shen Boli presided over the meeting, and Ye Zhengong served as the recorder. It was resolved that the New Taicang Daily would resume publication immediately. Shen Boli, Qian HaoCheng, Zhu Shoutong, Wu Jingwen, He Yuanming, Ye Bingruo, and Gong Junru were appointed as editors, and Minqiu as the accountant. The office will be located at the northern end of Lujia Bridge in Taicang City, and the Shanghai liaison office will be located at Guoguang Middle School on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai. It is also reported that Di Junwu, Qian HaoCheng, He Yuanming, and others plan to launch the New Taicang Society to unite the young people of their hometown and dedicate themselves to social undertakings. The draft constitution of the society has already been entrusted to Di Junwu, He Yuanming, and Shen Boli to draft.</p>

<h3>Headless Monster Fetus</h3>
<p>Zhong Liansheng, a merchant from Yangjing Town in Pudong, is 40 years old. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he married a woman named Chen from Jiangyin. Although their relationship has been good since their marriage, they still have no children. Both husband and wife have felt regretful. Every year, they pray to gods and Buddhas and take medicine, spending a lot of money. In July of last year, Chen suddenly became pregnant, and the couple were overjoyed, believing it was a blessing from the gods. On the 15th of this month, Chen went into labor and hired Zhou, a local midwife, to assist with the delivery. After more than three days, she still had not given birth. The mother was in great pain, and the midwife was helpless. Therefore, Yuan Huiyu and Zhang Hengdi, two female doctors from the Hongkou Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital in Tilanqiao, were hired to perform a surgery and remove the fetus. Although the fetus was male, it only had feet and no head or hands. Zhong believed it was unlucky and wanted to bury it. The two female doctors felt that the monster fetus had research value and requested it from him. Zhong refused, believing it was a matter of face. They then took a photo to provide for the study of physiologists and medical experts.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ship Collisions and Notes</h3>
<p>Rongxing Crashes and Damages Pier</p>
<p>The Rongxing, a ship belonging to the Zhaoxing Shipping Company of this port, weighs 833 tons, is 185 feet long, 36 feet wide, and 23 feet deep, with a draft of 14 feet. It was sailing from Shanghai to Beiyang. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Tianjin stating that when the Rongxing was docking at a pier in Tianjin, it crashed into the pier due to strong winds and high tides. Two barges, No. 140 and No. 61, belonging to the Yixing Company, were parked outside the pier and were badly damaged by the Rongxing. After damaging the two barges, the Rongxing also damaged the pier. Inspectors are currently being dispatched, and the extent of the damage is still being reported.</p>
<p>Haiyuan Sinks a Civilian Boat</p>
<p>The Haiyuan, a new Hai class vessel of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sailing from Nanhua to Shanghai. When the ship reached the Huangpu River, a civilian boat carrying garbage sailed out. When the boat reached the front of the Dongyang Wharf, it was violently hit by the Haiyuan and sank into the river immediately. The boat owner, Xia Xuegeng, and the boatmen fell into the water. Fortunately, a small tugboat nearby arrived in time to rescue the boatmen, and no lives were lost. Xia Xuegeng has reported the incident to the Fenghua Native Place Association in this port and has lodged a serious protest with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, demanding compensation for the loss. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has inquired with the captain on duty, who said that the civilian boat sailed across the river and ignored the whistle warnings. The company claims that the responsibility for the sinking lies with the civilian boat and that the Haiyuan is not responsible for the collision, and has rejected Xia Xuegeng's request.</p>
<h3>Zoo Elephant Electrocuted Itself Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>Xiangzuo Workers Clash with the Security Corps; Daring to Rob a Pistol Results in the Arrest of Four People; A Woman Was Severely Injured and Her Life is in Danger</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM yesterday, dozens of people claiming to be workers from Xiangzuo arrived at the Xiangzuo opened by Zhang Binsheng at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, and forced the workers to hold a meeting. Zhang ran to the No. 2 Defense Section of the Pengpu District Security Corps nearby to report the incident. Squad Leader Li Huaizhang immediately went to investigate, resulting in a conflict. In the confusion, the squad leader lost a six-inch, white Brownlim pistol, number 152795, with four bullets inside. A neighboring woman, Xia Lishi, was also injured and sent to the Pushan Hospital on Qinmin Road. Her life is in great danger. The corps members and team members arrived and arrested four people, bringing them to the team for interrogation. The team then prepared a letter and sent them to the Xinwen Branch Bureau. The following is an excerpt from the team's draft letter: "We are writing to inform you that Squad Leader Li Huaizhang of our Zhongshan Road Defense Section presented to the team witnesses Zhang Binsheng, worker Ge Si, Shi Youliang, Chen San, and Lin Daohuo to report that at around 10:00 AM today (yesterday), more than 60 workers, led by Ge Si, Chen San, and Lin Daohuo, went to the Xiangdian opened by Zhang Binsheng and forced the workers to hold a union meeting. Then Shi Youliang led 50-60 people from the south to the scene. The squad leader, seeing this, changed into armed attire and asked the workers for a meeting notice, but there was none, so he prohibited them from breaking into Xiangzuo. Unexpectedly, Ge Si and Shi Youliang were the first to start fighting, and Shi Youliang ordered the crowd to rob the squad leader's six-inch, white Brownlim pistol, number 151795, with four bullets. By the time the corps members and team members arrived, the crowd had scattered and fled. Neighbors helped to capture Ge Si, Shi Youliang, Chen San, and Lin Daohuo, and presented them to the team for disposition. According to Zhang Binsheng's statement, Ge Si, Chen San, and Lin Daohuo were the first to go to the Xiangzuo and forced the workers to hold a meeting. Although some workers had verbally notified the Xiangzuo of a strike a few days ago, there was no written notice. It is true that dozens of people arrived from the south. According to Ge Si, Shi Youliang, Chen San, and Lin Daohuo, they admitted to striking and holding a meeting, but Shi Youliang claimed that there were only a dozen or so people and denied robbing any weapons. This case involves forced strikes, disobeying prohibition, and daring to lead a crowd to rob weapons, which is a disregard for the law. Therefore, we are sending this letter to your bureau along with all the witnesses and evidence for your interrogation, with sincere respect. This is addressed to the Xinza Branch Bureau of Shanghai Municipality. The names, ages, and addresses of the defendants are recorded below: Plaintiff: Li Huaizhang, 40 years old, from Qingjiang. Defendants: Ge Si, 45 years old, from Tongzhou, residing in no fixed place; Shi Youliang, 40 years old, from Changzhou, residing at Changlezhai Xiangdian, Yaojia Stone Bridge, Zhabei; Chen San, 40 years old, from Tongzhou; Lin Daohuo, 43 years old, from Taixing. The above two people reside at 27 Huade Road, Tilanqiao in the Concession. Witness: Zhang Baosheng, 30 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at 31 Yugang, Zhabei. In addition, we have learned that the severely injured woman, Xia Lishi, is 51 years old, from Yancheng, residing in the Tiger Stove at 30 Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, and is currently in the hospital. According to Dr. Jia Shirong, she is currently in a critical condition. We also understand that the case has been interrogated by Bureau Officer Huang Chongren and sent to the Public Security General Bureau."</p>
<h3>The Public Concession's Fire Department Implements Austerity Guidelines; Subcommittee Presents Proposals to the Board of Directors; Advocates for Actively Training Chinese Staff</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the Ward Road Prison last summer and the transfer of all Western prisoners, there has been discussion of building a central fire station on the original site of the former Xiamen Road West Prison. This proposal was previously approved in principle by the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council, but due to the difficulty in raising construction funds, all plans had to be postponed. At the same time, the Director of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council felt that the development of the Public Concession Fire Brigade had been too rapid since 1920 and that the personnel should be reduced. Therefore, the Board of Directors appointed three directors, Kanai, Chillerly, and Bubo Zhuojiang, to form a subcommittee to investigate the organization and cost savings of the Fire Department. As it took a long time to obtain statistics on fire construction in various Eastern cities, the subcommittee was not able to meet until February of this year. Yesterday, the committee held ten meetings and personally investigated the general office of the Fire Department, the important branch stations, and the storage sites, and submitted a report to the Board of Directors, which was adopted at the Board of Directors meeting on the 8th of this month. According to the report of the subcommittee, the current personnel of the Fire Department should be appropriately reduced, and there is also room for savings in terms of equipment. In the future, after the implementation of austerity measures, the efficiency of the work will not be affected. The main points of the report are listed below: Abolish the Jisi Fei'er Branch Station; Reduce the number of fire trucks by seven; Reduce the number of personnel in the general office from fifteen to thirteen; Reduce the number of foreign staff in each station from forty-four to twenty-six; Reduce the number of Chinese staff from seven hundred and eighty-one to six hundred and forty-eight; Abolish three lookout towers and replace all other foreign staff with Chinese staff. According to the estimates of the Director of the Finance Department, the result of the above reductions is that the public treasury will save approximately 220,000 yuan per year. The subcommittee stated that after the Board of Directors accepted all the proposals in the report, the implementation and timing of the implementation would be decided by the Board of Directors. The committee praised the efficiency of the current Fire Department, but felt that the efficiency would not be adversely affected after the implementation of austerity measures. The Jisi Fei'er Fire Brigade was originally temporary, pending the completion of the Jing'an Temple Branch. Now that the Jing'an Temple Branch is sufficient for the western suburbs, the Jisi Fei'er Branch can be abolished. As for the reduction in the number of fire trucks, the method is to divide the six important branch stations into three major departments, each with seven ordinary fire trucks, one of which is a spare truck, and a turntable. The subcommittee claims that this reduction in the number of fire trucks will not hinder the work or reduce efficiency, but will save a lot of recurring expenses and personnel salaries. Furthermore, the reduction in the number of foreign personnel is the result of a detailed investigation of the allocation of duties of each foreign staff member. According to the committee's report, each branch only needs four foreign staff members, and many daily affairs can be handled by Chinese. However, the number of current fire prevention inspectors cannot be reduced, and the training of Chinese staff is also an urgent matter. The number of foreign personnel currently advocated is not a fixed number, and Chinese staff can be used to replace foreign staff in the future after they have received sufficient training and achieved outstanding efficiency. The current proposal to reduce the number of Chinese staff is based in part on the reduction in the number of machines and in part on the surplus set aside for sick leave and personal leave, and there is room for discussion. Furthermore, of the six existing lookout towers, three have no significant results and should be abolished immediately. The Board of Directors has decided to expedite the planning of how to implement the above sections of the austerity measures proposed by the subcommittee on the Fire Department.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Straw Shed in Lujiazui</h3>
<p>More than 100 straw sheds were built along the Xiaobang Beach outside the warehouse of the British American Tobacco Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong. They were connected for dozens of feet without interruption and were inhabited by poor people from Jiangbei. At around 2:30 AM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Yang Huaichun, a Shandong native who opened a pancake shop at No. 36. He was playing mahjong with friends for too long and was frying oil cakes for food. The flames from the stove caught fire to the straw house, and it quickly became out of control. The neighbors were awakened from their sleep and saw the fire, and they fled for their lives with the elderly and children. The British American Tobacco Factory requested the Pudong District Fire Brigade to report the incident, and Director Zhao immediately led his staff to drive to the scene to rescue. The British American Tobacco Factory fire brigade also assisted on the scene, but because the straw houses were extremely flammable, it was impossible to put out the fire for a while. After burning for more than an hour, the firefighters tore down the straw houses at the west end to stop the fire, and the fire gradually went out. A total of more than 50 straw houses were burned, and the loss was estimated at two to three thousand gold. After the fire was extinguished, the Pudong Public Bureau found that there were no deaths or injuries and took Yang Huaichun, the cause of the fire, to the bureau and transferred him to the General Bureau for disposition.</p>

Entertainment venues regularly perform a play, and the income is transferred to the donation. The Empire and Golden two theaters have already held performances, and other theaters can also handle it recently. The Party and National Flag Sales General Bureau suggested increasing national consciousness and encouraging shops and households in the city to purchase flags, with 15% of the sales price being used to purchase aircraft. The office should earnestly support and promote this. Furthermore, Xianghai Confectionery Company sent a letter stating that it would promote the sale of 50,000 yuan worth of the company's candy and donate half of the proceeds to purchase aircraft. Letters have been sent to various schools to sell the candy on a regular basis. Since the campaign to commemorate donations to purchase aircraft began, various solicitation teams have sent letters requesting that activities be expanded and intensified, and have reported their results. It is hoped that various field secretaries will work hard to assist and improve the results so that the mission can be completed on schedule. Various industries are collecting aviation nation-saving funds, which are progressing smoothly with the support of people from all walks of life. In order to lay the foundation for the development of aviation nation-saving and civil aviation, the association has completed the construction of a clubhouse and exhibition hall in the city center, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for May 5. Preparations are currently underway, and commemorative publications are being collected to promote the event.

Furthermore, the joint examination methods are only to assess students' academic performance. According to the regulations of the revised middle school and normal school regulations, students who fail their conduct or physical education scores will not be promoted or graduated. Each school should strictly assess the conduct and physical education scores of the graduating students and should not allow them to participate in the joint examination solely because their academic performance is passable, regardless of whether their conduct and physical education scores are passable.

<h3>Hu Shi Lectures on the Thought of the Yan-Li School</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) At 4:00 PM on the 20th, the Capital Lecture Hall held its eighth lecture at Central University. Wang Shijie, Luo Jialun, Lei Zhen, and more than 1,500 faculty, staff, and students from universities and colleges in the capital attended. Hu Shi lectured on "The Thought of the Yan-Li School." The gist of his speech was that from the Eastern Han Dynasty to the Northern Song Dynasty, for more than a thousand years, Indian religious thought was imported into our country. Later, Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism was influenced by it, advocating either meditation or the investigation of things, which were not the positive and active philosophy of life of ancient China. Although it used opposition to Indian thought as its slogan, it failed to restore the cultural thought rooted in China. The Yan-Li School was a kind of anti-Neo-Confucian movement, seeking to restore the true cultural thought rooted in China. The founder of this school, Yan Yuan, made three contributions in thought: Overturning the dualistic view of life and the universe since the Song and Ming Dynasties, and valuing the physical body and the real world; Advocating practice, believing that only through practice can one know right and wrong, truth and falsehood, which is a kind of dynamic educational philosophy; Advocating practicality, opposing book education. Hu cited extensively and eloquently, and the audience expressed great satisfaction.</p>
<h3>Ye Chengyi on Sichuan Education Discusses National Education Throughout the Country (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Ye Chengyi, an expert in educational investigation, has been running schools in Sichuan for twenty years and enjoys a great reputation. Last autumn, he went to more than ten provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Pinghan, etc. to investigate national education. He gave more than ten lectures on national education issues wherever he went, and was very popular. Mr. Ye returned to Beijing yesterday after his investigation. The reporter visited him and learned that he would write "My Views on Reforming Chinese Education" and "How to Implement Compulsory Education in China" based on his investigation, which will be published in three months. He agreed to first talk about the current situation of national education in various provinces and cities and his feelings about the investigation, which are recorded below. The reporter asked, "Sir, you have been engaged in the national education movement for a long time and have a very clear understanding of the importance of national education. Now I would like to hear the details." Ye replied, "I feel that our country has been running schools for forty years, but has completely ignored the implementation of national education, so that the people who are called the citizens of the Republic of China still mistakenly believe that there is an emperor and lack people who are in line with the times and citizens who are in line with the national conditions. That is why there is such a serious national crisis today. Now that foreign troubles are imminent, and things are about to happen, people are gradually awakening. So they are busy and chaotic, either training out-of-school youths and adults here and there bit by bit, or relieving rural areas, hoping to solve the urgent problem. It is a bit late to dig a well when thirsty, because whether it is young people or adults, they have already formed a tendency to be obedient people of the emperor, and the die is cast, and it is extremely difficult to transform them. But if our people want to seek a fundamental solution, and hope to avoid national disasters in the future, the only way to start with the entire national education can be effective. Otherwise, the national crisis will inevitably become serious to the end, until it becomes unmanageable, and the country will be destroyed and the species reduced. I am now summarizing what I said, the so-called national education movement has two meanings: The symptomatic approach is to quickly train the youth and adults of the whole country, and it is necessary to pay attention to teaching the farmers in the countryside to know what it is (there is no time to teach them why), without explaining the reasons, and striving to cultivate their awareness of following actions. This is the so-called sorting out bad money and doing everything to obey the destiny. The fundamental solution is to make the greatest determination to use a large amount of financial resources to force school-age children across the country to enter school, eradicate the traditional national inferiority, and establish a new national consciousness. It is called casting perfect new coins and sowing the seeds of revival. In short, my understanding is that without citizens who are in line with the times, the country will perish." The reporter asked, "Sir, after passing through various provinces and cities, what is the situation of their national education?" Ye replied, "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and major cities and experimental areas have strong economic power, have been running schools for a long time, and have achieved good results. Shandong has been gradually implementing compulsory education since 1930. The people in charge have a fighting spirit in a bad environment. The people in the education field have far-reaching plans, and the publicity is effective. People are willing to invest in running schools. Many counties, such as Qihe, have people signing and stamping seals to levy taxes according to mu, and each village has a school, which is really rare. However, although this method has been approved by the provincial and provincial departments, it has not been finally approved, which is worth noting. In the past, Hubei focused on cities. The provincial education funds were only more than 1.7 million. After Director Cheng took office, he tried his best to focus on local education, vigorously implemented joint insurance to set up schools, mass education, and special education, and achieved very good results. Short-term elementary schools in various counties are also established on schedule. There are many private or clan-established elementary schools in Hunan counties, and the funding in each county is more than that in Hubei. The education field is very energetic. Director Zhu travels to various counties from time to time to promote compulsory education with great efforts. The education field in Guangxi Province has a unified consciousness and consistent methods. All private schools are closed, and each village has a school. His national education facilities have far-reaching and deep ambitions, preparations suitable for national conditions and local environment (self-edited textbooks), a spirit of continuous progress, and hard-working behavior. The organization and training of youth and adults are also very hard. Collection horns can be heard everywhere at dawn, but because of the lack of talent and economy, the quality is not perfect. They say they are seeking existence first. Primary schools in Guangdong are still developed, and the enrollment of children has reached 39%. The provincial primary education continued for a total of more than 1.6 million, and there are many perfect elementary school buildings in the countryside, most of which were established with donations from overseas Chinese."</p>

<h3>Yu Lie Crossed to the East Yesterday for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yu Lie, styled Gangfu, is 34 years old and belongs to Yuqian, Zhejiang. He has served as an executive member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, head of the training and instruction section for provincial party affairs personnel, president and editor-in-chief of the MinGuo Daily, and director of moral education in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, and teacher of Chinese language and civics for more than ten years, and has achieved remarkable results.

Now, in order to seek further studies and to familiarize himself with the actual situation of neighboring countries, Mr. Yu took a boat to the East yesterday (the 19th) morning to conduct research on specific issues and to investigate the actual situation of Japanese society. Many relatives and friends in Hangzhou and Shanghai heard the news and went to the port to see him off.</p>
<p>School Survey</p>
<h3>Overview of Shanghai British School (3)</h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Administrative Organization The school affairs of the school are presided over by the School Affairs Committee. The School Affairs Committee has seven members: four of whom are elected by the Leicester Heritage Fund Management Committee; and three are elected by the Holy Trinity Cathedral. The School Affairs Committee is responsible for matters such as school property and fund management; other training matters within the school are entrusted to the principal with full authority.</p>
<p>The number of students in the school is not large, so the administrative organization is quite simple. The principal is responsible for the administration of the entire school; only one secretary assists him. The School Affairs Committee entrusts Thomson Accountants to handle all financial custody and income and expenditure matters in the school; this method can also reduce the principal's duties. All teachers and staff hold a monthly meeting every month to report on the academic performance of students at all levels and discuss and urge students to study.</p>
<p>Financial Income and Expenditure In 1934, the school's annual expenditure budget was more than 142,000 yuan: of which the salaries of teachers and staff, the wages of school workers, and the subsidies for the principal and teachers to return home in rotation accounted for 100,000 yuan; accounting for 70% of the total expenditure. Of the income items, tuition income accounted for more than 37,000 yuan, accounting for 26% of the total income; income and interest from the Leicester Heritage Fund accounted for more than 94,000 yuan, accounting for 66% of the total income; other subsidies from the Public Works Bureau and miscellaneous income accounted for 11,000 yuan, accounting for 8% of the total income.</p>
<p>The amount of student tuition varies slightly from year to year. Students in the first and second years of the preparatory course pay 200 yuan per year; students in the first and second years of the junior high school and the first year of the senior high school pay 275 yuan per year; students in the second to fourth years of the senior high school pay 330 yuan per year. The cost of books and supplies is 15 yuan per student per year; and the sports fee is 4 yuan per student per year. Tuition fees and book and supply fees are paid monthly, and parents pay directly to Thomson Accountants. The school has fee reduction measures for families with many children. If there are two or more children in a family studying at the school, the first child pays the full fee, and the second and third children can each reduce 5 yuan. If a student is absent due to illness and the holiday is too long, the parents can send a letter to the School Affairs Committee requesting to pay half the fee. Because the school has a small number of students, but it is complete in scale and has a lot of expenses, the education expenses spent on each student each year are quite large. The school's expenditure budget in 1934 was more than 142,000 yuan, and the number of students throughout the year was 300, so the average education expense spent on each student each year accounted for 470 yuan, which is really not a small number!</p>
<p>4. "Gentleman Training"</p>
<p>Gentleman training is a feature of British education. The ideal of British public schools is to cultivate law-abiding gentlemen. The school's education naturally has the same ideal. Gentleman training can be explained from both formal and substantive aspects. In terms of form, all students must wear the prescribed hats and clothing to achieve unity. The school stipulates the format of students' clothing and hats as follows: gray trousers or shorts, sportswear (school color), gray socks, school tie, collared shirt (not a bow tie), gray shirt, school hat.</p>
<p>The principal and teachers also wear academic gowns during class to set an example. Students must abide by order in class and be polite.</p>

<h3>National Sports Association Announces List of Participants for Track and Field Training – Registration Closed Yesterday – Starts in Beiping on the 23rd</h3>
<p>The selection committee has decided to start registration first for the track and field team participating in the World Games, and to gather strong athletes from across the country who have announced standard results. Training will begin at Tsinghua University in Beiping on the 25th and end on May 25th. Then the team will be reorganized and come south to Shanghai, where a selection competition will be held on May 31st. Foreign track and field experts will also be invited to participate to increase the interest in competition. The registration has been closed yesterday. The provinces, cities, and districts have successively registered with the Sports Association. Fu Jincheng of Singapore also registered through Hu Wenhu yesterday to participate in the preliminary election. However, when arriving in Beiping, he must wait for the test results to pass before he can be treated equally. The list of registrations is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Women's Training for the World Games Abolished – Swimming Representatives to be Determined After Zhou Jiaqi Returns to Shanghai – Two Football Representatives Stay in Hong Kong Due to Matters</h3>
<p>The preliminary training for my participation in the track and field events of the World Games closed registration yesterday. Liu Changchun, a short-distance running athlete, also sent a quick letter to the Sports Association yesterday, reporting that he would not participate. The entire list was announced yesterday afternoon. According to Shen Siliang's talk to the Guoguang News Agency reporter, this decision on my participation in the World Games, regarding women's track and field training, has been abolished because Tsinghua has no spare rooms to accommodate female athletes. Moreover, the World Games does not invite female athletes, so women's training, in my opinion, is not necessary. As for the swimming athletes, after Mr. Zhou Jiaqi returns to Shanghai, after another negotiation, a decision can be made. After Mr. Rong Qizhao returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he has already met and talked about the football preliminary election in Hong Kong. The football delegation has been scheduled to depart from Hong Kong for Shanghai tomorrow (22nd). Two of the representatives cannot come together due to matters, so a total of 20 people will come to Shanghai. In the future, the competition matters in Nanyang have been properly negotiated. It was previously reported that there were often questions in Singapore, which have now been successfully resolved, because the Sports Association has received a reply from the Tiger Sports Association expressing its approval.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Talks about Participating in the World Games – Going to Germany and Canada to Observe and Learn – Mr. Zhang Arrived in Shanghai a Few Days Ago and Will Return to Tianjin Starting Today</h3>
<p>Zhang Boling, director of the National Sports Association and delegate of the World Games, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago (18th) and stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road. The reporter went to visit him and accepted his views on our country's participation in the World Games. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Germany to Participate and Learn Zhang said, "Although our country's sports have developed rapidly in recent years, there is still little contact with Western countries. Germany is an advanced country in sports, and its domestic sports administration and various facilities are worthy of our country's imitation. This decision on our country's participation in the World Games, although the number of events is not large, the representatives sent are all energetic and experienced athletes. With this opportunity, they can visit and hone in that country, and return in the future to provide the government with adoption. As for the hope of scoring points, according to my observation, except for football, which is still above the level, it can compete with other countries. The basketball aspect is far from the United States, and there is even less certainty in track and field."</p>
<p>Basketball Training Achieved Excellent Results Zhang continued, "The date of the World Games is approaching in an instant, and our country has actively prepared. The basketball representatives have been selected and are now training at Tsinghua University in Beiping. I went to Ping once before to inspect. Mr. Dong Shouyi is very hard-working in his guidance, and the training is very successful. It is expected that the training will end and the results will be considerable. In addition, the football representatives have just announced the selection in Hong Kong, and the track and field representatives will also be concentrated for training."</p>
<p>Presiding over School Affairs Unable to Go to Germany Zhang finally continued, "I attended the meeting of the Palace Museum in Beijing on the 18th and came to Shanghai to attend today's Nankai Alumni Association. I plan to return to Tianjin on the 21st. As for this World Games, because I will go to Chongqing in mid-August to preside over the opening ceremony of Nanyu Middle School, I am afraid that I will not be able to accompany them to Germany."</p>
<h3>China-England Firing Last Shot – Shen Lince Defeats Borkell – Result 600 Points to 595 – Today Ding Mingyi vs. Burton</h3>
<p>Shen Lince, a veteran of shooting in our country, relied on his last shot yesterday to score 26 points in a row, and instead defeated the Englishman Borkell with 600 points to 595 points. In the China-England International Shooting Competition, the Chinese team won five more points, still leading by 49 points in front. Starting at 5:30 PM today, Ding Mingyi will face Burton. The two have outstanding skills, precise strategies, and rich experience. The competition of 600 points will be very tense and worth watching.</p>
<p>Three Major Periods The two have superb skills and sufficient experience. In the process of 600 points, it can be divided into three major periods. In the first period, Shen occupied the upper hand, scoring huge points in a row, with a difference of 175 points to 125 points (50) and 295 points to 210 points (85 points). When the 71st shot was approaching, another period was formed. Borkell came from behind, and once led with 563 to 474 points (a difference of 89 points). Shen's largest record also appeared, and the highest score of 51 points in the three games became the key to the outcome of the battle between the two sides. Shen came with a shot of 26 points in the 89th shot. This last shot created a victory of 600 points to 595. Shen's scores were 23, 38, 35, 29, 31, 22, 20, 51, 30, 26, etc. Borkell's scores were 29, 21, 27, 39, 36, 20, 22.</p>
<p>Last Shot At the beginning of the 15 shots, the two seemed to suffer from the disease of getting on the court. Until the 26th shot, Shen gained 38 points in one shot with his all-round skills, and from then on, his face was renewed and he took the upper hand. Before long, he scored a few shots in a row, such as 25 points, 29 points, 31 points, and 22 points, forming a difference of 295 to 210. From the 48th shot, Borkell's time came and he continued to progress. Shen seemed to be trapped in thorns and at a loss. By the 71st shot, Borkell scored 39 points in one shot, suddenly surpassing 30 points, forming a ratio of 464 to 434. Continuing to add 36 and 0 points in two shots, it became 520 to 446 (a difference of 74). In the 80th shot, he got two more points, resulting in a difference of 89 points (563 to 474). When Shen's momentum declined, he worked hard to cheer himself up, and fully expressed the skills and experience he had gained in more than ten years in the 81st shot, creating the highest record of 51 points in the three games. Borkell's bad luck increased frequently, and he often lost by a hair's breadth. At that time, Shen scored another 30 points in one shot, becoming 574 to 588. It was Borkell's turn, and when he reached 595, 5 points short of 600 points, he suddenly missed his hand carelessly. Shen completed 26 points in one breath, reached the end point first in one shot, and won the victory.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Open Handball Exhibition Opened Yesterday – Singles and Doubles Were Won by Chinese – Sun Jialu Easily Took Pei Qi in the Singles Competition – Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu Won in the Doubles</h3>
<p>The Western Youth-sponsored Open Handball Tournament opened yesterday afternoon. The first two groups, Naditi and Li Bie, forfeited, and Annakov and Smith got it without labor. In the third group, Bainatoff vs. Bauseli, Bauseli made a smooth shot and won the first game first, but in the second and third games, he was defeated and lost from victory to defeat with two to one. Bauseli is one of the famous Western players, but he was miserably defeated by Bai today, which is unexpected. In the fourth group, Sun Jialu vs. Bei Qi, Sun shot the ball with both hands, making it difficult for Bei Qi to parry. After several rounds, he was able to find his way left and right, and he immediately won two games in a row with 21 to 4 and 21 to 8. The final doubles were Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu to Linertklick. Hua Yan used the martial arts hit method, and in the first game, they made the opponent stumped. In the second game, China Yan was determined to win the ticket, and the offense and defense were not as cautious as in the first game, so Lake took advantage of the situation and lost a game. However, the final victory still belonged to the two. The scores of each group and today's schedule are recorded below.</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of Spitting</h3>
<p>— Gu Renwei</p>
<p>It's not because I studied medicine and became a bit neurotic, but having grown up in a village since childhood, I had already developed a good habit of not spitting casually. I remember when I was very young, I disliked people spitting, and even when the servants were carrying dishes and rice, I would never allow them to speak, fearing that the saliva in their mouths would spray into the dishes or rice. Because of my dislike, I paid attention, so I always noticed other people's spitting. The day before yesterday, on the tram, I suddenly saw (also often seen) a compatriot spitting phlegm on the floor of the car, and immediately saw a foreigner sitting opposite, rolling his green eyes, and at the same time showing a look of contempt, a kind of indescribable Western expression, revealed in his eyebrows and eyes. At that time, I felt both ashamed and angry, and my face turned red, but the person who spat phlegm didn't care at all, and turned his head out of the window with a self-satisfied look. How can this not make foreigners despise us Chinese everywhere? There are countless facts like this.</p>
<p>Recently, the hygiene movement and the anti-tuberculosis campaign, I don't know when they will get a good response, because when it comes to the "public morality" that has always been advocated, not many people can pay attention to it to this day. Those who do not care about public morality will never care about public hygiene. There are often many things that are knowingly done wrong, such as knowing that snot is dirty, but insisting on wiping it on a public towel; knowing that colds can be contagious, but insisting on posting advertisements for "selling severe colds" all over the streets. Although customers may not be willing to come, all of this shows that our countrymen do not value public morality, a kind of inferior nature of harming others. In their minds, they think that spreading diseases to others will cure their own diseases, but in fact, they should know that diseases can be contagious. After spreading them to others, their own diseases will not only not be reduced by a fraction, but may even be aggravated, because if only you are sick, the environment is good, which can also help you recover completely; if everyone is sick, the environment deteriorates, and your disease will only increase. Therefore, destroying public hygiene is destroying personal hygiene, and harming public morality is harming private morality. As the saying goes, "Those who harm others will be harmed by others"—compatriots, the net of heaven is vast, don't do evil!</p>
<p>Now, let's get back to the topic of spitting. Phlegm is the secretion in the trachea. When the natural physiological function requires it to be discharged, we can't deliberately resist it. The worst thing is when you have phlegm but can't spit it out, and it blocks your lungs, that's really painful. So you always have to spit out phlegm, because if you absolutely "prohibit spitting," you have to stuff the phlegm in your throat, which is uncomfortable, and keep it in your mouth, which is endless. Swallowing it into your stomach is even more inappropriate, so you can only spit it out. However, there are methods for spitting, and there is a philosophy of spitting—it's not that I'm misusing words, people also have examples of a "philosophy of eating"—how should you spit phlegm? Please see the following:</p>
<p>Because phlegm can transmit diseases, it is best to spit on your own handkerchief at any time and place, without hurting others or harming yourself.</p>
<p>When you don't have a handkerchief, spit into a spittoon at home, and spit in a place with flowing sewage outside (such as a gutter on the side of the road).</p>
<p>If both of the above are not possible, then you can only spit in places where people don't often walk or live, and</p>
<p>Places where dust is not easily blown around.</p>
<p>If the habit is not easy to change for a while, and you just want to spit arbitrarily, you also have to look around for pedestrians, so as not to spit on others.</p>
<p>Don't use force when spitting. Just use the tip of your tongue to send the phlegm to the edge of your mouth, and scrape it with your upper and lower teeth, and the phlegm will be spit out, because when you use force, the phlegm scatters and sprays onto other people's faces or nearby food, which is even more embarrassing. I often see people on trams spitting vigorously towards the window, so the spit scatters, and along with the wind outside the window, it will blow like drizzle towards the people in the neighboring seats, which is so annoying! And sometimes pedestrians outside the car will also be harmed, which is such an immoral thing! There are also shopkeepers in grocery stores. When their business is slow, they lie on the counter and spit phlegm very hard on the side of the road. Sometimes, it happens that a pedestrian walks by and spits on them, and it is common to see them scolding and fighting. I heard that they intentionally spit very far with force. When they spit far, it shows that their "vital energy is sufficient," but in fact, it is your vital energy that is greatly damaged! Friends! Take care of yourself! Quickly change this bad habit!</p>
<h3>Character Change and Character Deterioration</h3>
<p>— Zong Ze</p>
<p>—Ordinary people may also have character changes—</p>
<p>The so-called deterioration refers to changes in the human spirit. From a medical standpoint, it can be divided into two types: one is due to congenital or hereditary factors in mental patients, and the other is caused by stimulation and repression after a person is born, and its symptoms are similar to those of mental patients. These people are called degenerates, which can be roughly divided into three types: mental disorder constitution, tendency, and transsexual. The former is the lightest, the latter is more serious, and the latter is the most serious.</p>
<p>The so-called mental disorder constitution is often found in healthy people. When they encounter a certain opportunity (such as pregnancy, mental overwork, menstruation, physical illness, etc.), they show a tendency to mental disorders. The so-called mental disorder tendency refers to the fact that patients with mental disorder-like symptoms already show obvious symptoms of the disease in ordinary times (such as neurasthenia, obsessive ideas, phobias, impulsive actions, etc.) but have not yet entered the realm of true mental disorders. The so-called mental disorder transsexual refers to those who are closest to mental patients and whose morality is very bad, and their intelligence is also particularly bad.</p>
<p>In modern times, with the development of science, scholars have different explanations for the causes of character deterioration. As mentioned earlier, the causes of character deterioration are either due to congenital and hereditary factors or due to stimulation and repression. However, according to scholars of recent psychoanalysis, who have conducted detailed research on all unconscious behaviors outside human consciousness, some people also recognize the former (congenital heredity) and believe that the deterioration of human character is all acquired.</p>
<p>Here, I will first briefly list the characteristics of degenerates, and then we will explain the reasons for their deterioration.</p>
<p>Any character that is different from ordinary people and peculiar is called a degenerate character. Examples of degenerate characters that can be listed here are stubborn ego, capricious eccentricities, inconsistency between words and actions, moodiness, fear or recklessness when encountering things, dementia, preference for treating animals, cruelty and harshness to others, leniency and self-forgiveness to oneself, and uneven development of intelligence, such as having outstanding achievements in a certain skill, while showing particularly low abilities in other areas. Naturally, these kinds of characters are not absolutely limited to a certain kind of talent. Even in ordinary healthy people, such characters can be found to some extent, the only difference being the strength and weakness. Nowadays, people mostly tend to material things, and the repression of the human heart is getting stronger day by day. Mental life has changed from stability to the opposite extreme, so it is either distress or annoyance. The more severe the internal repression, the deeper the mental stimulation. As a result, even ordinary people are very prone to character deterioration.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the human spirit is composed of two tendencies: one is unlimited demands, and the other is the restriction of these unlimited demands. Freud broadly attributed the former to the pursuit of pleasure, and the latter is generally included in the repression (realistic repression). The beginning of this repression is from the time a person is born, that is, from the time a breastfed infant is given milk, there is a tendency to pursue pleasure (oral pleasure). This pursuit of oral pleasure continues for more than a year, and the infant's interest gradually turns to excretion behavior (anal sensuality). Infants in their second year generally have great interest in excretion behavior and use this to spend their self-enjoying lives. After some time, infants in their third and fourth years develop interest in sexual organs (infant masturbation), or like to look at (voyeurism) their sexual organs, or like to expose (exhibitionism) their genitals to others. Moreover, during this period, they also like to abuse small animals (ants, flies, etc.) to vent their desires through the act of stripping and killing living things (sadism or Sadism). Thus, after a certain period, infants gradually hide this tendency until they are six or seven years old, and what follows is a kind of shame, sympathy, vomiting sensation, etc., gradually tending towards the moral aspect. This period is called the latent period.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, infants must spend their lives enjoying the pursuit of pleasure within a certain period of time, and if we do not handle it properly during this period, it is easy to cause mental abnormalities in infants, which is the period when degenerates and mental and neurological patients are created.</p>
<p>What is meant by improper handling? This point needs to be further explained. We already know that the first form of desire (instinct) expressed by a person after leaving the womb begins with breastfeeding. Infants enjoy their lives through the oral pleasure of breastfeeding. Therefore, in other words, breastfeeding is the infant's paradise, and after this paradise life continues for more than a year, the child reaches the weaning period. After weaning, infants often have a tendency to hate and dislike their parents, and they always harbor a psychology of revenge, forming the so-called stubborn nature of infants. If the parent does not understand the psychology of the infant and criticizes or punishes the stubborn behavior, the infant will inevitably turn from hatred to terror. Under unavoidable repression, the infant has to give up what he loves, and the weak heart is always filled with terrifying concepts. Under these circumstances, it is very easy to cause character deterioration in infants. Not only that, but after extreme hatred and terror, infants cannot get rid of the impression they have received. For example, when an infant who loves to eat milk the most finds something like milk in food after weaning, it can immediately trigger the infant's vomiting sensation (hysterical vomiting</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, if the handling of infant sensuality is dealt with in the same form, the result will undoubtedly cause the infant to develop a dislike of sexual organs, and some may even reach adulthood without being able to eliminate their stubborn views. The so-called marriage phobia, etc., is actually caused by this.</p>
<p>If we use appropriate psychoanalysis (analysis treatment) to deal with the character deterioration constituted by the aforementioned situation, it is not difficult to achieve</p>

<p>the purpose of correction.</p>
<p>The organization of the human spirit is very complex, and the causes of character deterioration are certainly not limited to the above. In recent years, European and American countries have advocated the use of preventive methods for early-onset dementia and juvenile neurosis, because the occurrence of these diseases has a great impact on the health of the entire nation, so it is indeed a very serious social problem. However, in order to prevent the spread of this disease, on the one hand, we must use the policy of improving the environment to engage in prevention, and on the other hand, we must also rely on omnipotent science (medicine) to save those poor people who have become ill.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(85) Entropion and Ectropion</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, infants must spend a certain amount of time</p>
<p>The eyelid is an organ that protects the eyeball, dominating the function of opening and closing the palpebral fissure. It can keep the front of the eyeball moist and maintain the cleanliness of the eyeball, removing dust and other objects from entering. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle dominates the opening of the eye. The orbicularis oculi muscle dominates the closing of the eye. There is cartilage in the eyelid, called the tarsal plate, which is made of strong connective tissue. Its conjunctiva, called the palpebral conjunctiva, is the most susceptible part of the disease. The terrible trachoma also occurs here. The anterior edge of the eyelid has villi, which are called eyelashes. The shape of the eyelid is neither entropion nor ectropion. However, when there is an opportunity for pathological relationship, these two abnormalities can occur. The causes and types of entropion and ectropion are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(A) Entropion can be divided into three types due to its causes.</p>
<p>Cicatricial entropion—In trachoma (most common), corrosion of the conjunctiva, and external injuries of the conjunctiva, the palpebral conjunctiva often causes cicatricial contraction, resulting in entropion.</p>
<p>Spasmodic entropion—When there are herpes or ulcers on the cornea, this disease often occurs due to the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle.</p>
<p>Cutaneous entropion—When children have a lot of subcutaneous fat in the lower eyelid, or during the period of skin relaxation in the elderly, mild entropion can often be caused.</p>
<p>Once the eyelid is inverted, the eyelashes will turn inward, thus stimulating the cornea, causing tearing and foreign body sensation, or even causing corneal opacity or ulcer.</p>
<p>(B) Ectropion can be divided into four types due to its causes.</p>
<p>Cicatricial ectropion—After the eyelid skin has been traumatized, burned, or osteomyelitis of the orbital margin, the skin often causes cicatricial contraction, resulting in ectropion. The eyelid conjunctiva is also exposed outward, thus causing tearing, eyelid eczema, conjunctival redness and thickening, corneal opacity or ulcer, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Paralytic ectropion—When suffering from facial nerve palsy, the orbicularis oculi muscle often becomes relaxed, causing mild ectropion.</p>
<p>Conjunctivitis ectropion—It is caused by conjunctivitis thickening. This kind of ectropion can often be seen in cases of severe trachoma.</p>
<p>Senile ectropion—The skin and muscles of the elderly are mostly weak and relaxed. At this time, mild ectropion can often be caused.</p>
<p>Whether the eyelid is entropion or ectropion, a specialist doctor must perform surgery to restore it to its original state. Otherwise, it will damage the appearance and harm the cornea. It should not be ignored.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(Plant) Originally from the tropics, it can be cultivated everywhere. It is an annual vine. The whole plant is densely covered with coarse hairs. The leaves are alternate, with long petioles, heart-shaped, palmately five-lobed, with toothed edges and blunt tips. Monoecious. In summer, it bears large yellow, five-lobed, connate petals between the leaves and stems. The berries are gourd-shaped in different sizes.</p>
<p>Pumpkin C. moschata, Duch. var. melonae formis, Makino The berries are larger than the previous species, oblate-spherical, with longitudinal grooves, and concave on both upper and lower surfaces.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Pumpkin Seed Semen Cucurbitae, collected from the above two plants. This product is flat oval, about 1.5 cm long, with a narrow tip. The weight of 10 of them is equivalent to about 1 gram. The seed coat is light yellow, quite thin, and slightly tough. The white, fat embryo is hidden in the middle. The taste is mild and similar to oil.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The seeds contain about 34% fatty oil, the main components of which are Glycerides of Linlsaure, oleic acid Plmitinsaure Stearinsaure, etc. It also contains Vrease.</p>
<p>The pulp contains the yellow pigment Carotin and the bases Adenin, Asparagin, and Trigonellin.</p>
<p>Eating too much pumpkin often turns the skin yellow, which is the so-called carotenemia Carotinosis. This Carotin does not change in the body, and is excreted along with sweat, staining the fat of the stratum corneum of the skin yellow; but it is not harmful to health. If the metabolism is strong, it can disappear quickly. Eating too much tangerines also causes the same symptoms.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Pumpkin seeds can be used as a drug to expel tapeworms. The dosage for one time is 30 grams. First remove the seed coat, crush it in a mortar, add water, and make a milky liquid for consumption.</p>
<p>(3) Snake Gourd Trichosanthes Cueumeroidis, Maxim.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows wild in the wilderness, a perennial vine. Stems and leaves are densely hairy, with tendrils, but do not branch. The leaves are dark green, alternate, with petioles, heart-shaped, with 3-5 shallow lobes and blunt tips. Dioecious. In summer, it bears white unisexual flowers, with 5-lobed corollas, and the edges of the lobes are thread-like and finely split. The berries are red when ripe and are extremely round.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) Snake Gourd Root Radix Trichosanthis Cucumeroidis, collected from its roots, peeled and dried. This product is a off-white irregular piece, the size of which is similar to that of Trichosanthes kirilowii root. The fracture surface is white and powdery, with a firm and brittle texture.</p>
<p>Snake Gourd Seed Seneb Trichosantbis Cucumeroidis collected from its seeds. This product is flat oval or rectangular, about 1 cm long, 5 mm wide, and 3 mm thick. There is a 5 mm wide ring in the center, slightly raised, with obvious pits at both ends. The surface is gray or dark brown, rough in texture, and easily broken.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The root contains a large amount of starch.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Old prescription: Old snake gourd root has special effects on treating jaundice and blood in the stool. It is also diuretic and promotes lactation, and is also effective. The daily dosage is 8 grams, used as a decoction. Trichosanthes kirilowii root can also be used as a substitute. Snake gourd seeds also have effects in treating jaundice and blood in the stool.</p>
<h3>Tooth Knowledge Q&amp;A (29)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 139) What kind of food is most valuable for the nutrition of teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Foods rich in calcium (i.e., lime), phosphorus, and vitamins C and D, such as meats, fish, milk, egg yolks, fruits, and vegetables, are very beneficial for teeth and bones.</p>
<p>(Question 140) What kind of food has little benefit for teeth? Answer: Carbohydrate foods, including starches such as rice, wheat, potatoes, and sugars. These two types of food, or mixed products of the two types, can only provide the body with heat and energy, and have very little power to increase and repair cells, so they cannot nourish teeth. Moreover, these types of food are very sticky and easily adhere to teeth, making them prone to decay.</p>
<p>(Question 141) Why is the impact of diet on teeth most significant in childhood?</p>
<p>Answer: Childhood is a period of growth, and the foundation of teeth for life is laid at this time. Foods rich in nutrients are necessary to help the growth of teeth, bones, and muscles; otherwise, development will inevitably be frustrated. After weaning, animal milk should still be the main food, with other foods as supplements. As age increases, other miscellaneous foods can be gradually added, such as fish, meat, eggs, fruits, and vegetables, all of which should be eaten more.</p>
<p>(Question 142) What are the major shortcomings of children's diets in our country? Answer: Children's diets in our country are mostly biased towards carbohydrates. After children are weaned, they mostly eat porridge, rice, cakes, pastries, and candies, and eat less fish, meat, milk, eggs, and other essential foods for growth. Even for young people in their teens or twenties whose growth is not yet complete, even in poor families, the diet is mostly weighted in this way: too much supply of heat and energy, and too little supply of growth materials. As a result, not only are teeth and bones not strong, but also other parts of the body cannot fully develop. The weakness of the physical strength of the Chinese people and the unsuitability of food may be a major reason. Those responsible for education should really pay attention to and improve the poor diet of students.</p>
<p>(Question 143) What beneficial supplementary foods are there to compensate for the lack of nutrition in the diet of the Chinese people, which are good for teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: In Chinese society, there are few wealthy families and many poor families. Not to mention that many people do not have knowledge of food nutrition, even if they know the nourishing value of fish, meat, milk, etc., they cannot afford to buy them regularly. To compensate for the lack of nutrition in the general diet, you can often take cod liver oil. Cod liver oil has three benefits: The nutrients it contains are richer than any other oil, and it contains extremely high amounts of vitamins A and D, which are very beneficial for the nutrition of teeth and the whole body. It is easier to digest than other oils and can help the absorption of phosphorus and calcium. Pure cod liver oil is extremely cheap, about four yuan can buy a gallon, enough for an adult for several months, the monthly cost is only one yuan. This kind of cheap and reliable tonic is really most suitable for Chinese society and can be popularized among the general public. For children, it is advisable to take it all year round to increase the nutrition of the whole body and the resistance of teeth. Some people refuse to take pure cod liver oil because they dislike the fishy smell. In fact, after patiently taking it for one or two weeks, they should no longer feel any difficulty. There is no need to spend more money to buy cod liver oil products. Also, for children in inland rural areas who do not have milk and are not easy to get cod liver oil, they can eat more eggs. Egg yolks are as beneficial to teeth as cod liver oil.</p>
<p>(Question 144) What is the relationship between the benefits of food for teeth and the ease of food digestion?</p>
<p>Answer: Food that is difficult to digest, even if it is rich in nutrients, is of no benefit to teeth. Therefore, food must be selected that is easy to digest. However, the ease of food digestion is difficult to judge and varies from person to person. However, it is more appropriate to choose according to personal preferences, that is, foods that suit the appetite are generally easy to digest, and foods that do not suit the appetite should not be eaten more.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (87)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Prevention of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>When it comes to the prevention of this disease, one cannot help but think of another question, which is: What exactly are the causes of this disease? The answer to this question, of course, cannot be separated from tubercle bacilli. However, we must understand that the establishment of every infectious disease must have two conditions: one is the existence of pathogenic bacteria, and the other is the lack of the body's defense ability. These two have their own characteristics, and neither is complete without the other. Therefore, the entry of pathogenic bacteria into the human body alone does not necessarily constitute a pathological change; conversely, although the body's defense ability is lacking, if there is no existence of pathogenic bacteria, infection cannot be established either. To give an example, like pneumococcus for pneumonia, it can often be seen in the throats of ordinary people. If they catch a cold and lack the body's defense ability, this disease can be constituted. Diphtheria is the same. It is not that as soon as there is pneumococcus or diphtheria bacillus in the oral cavity, these two diseases will occur immediately—the situation of pulmonary tuberculosis is, of course, no exception. The invasion of the human body by its pathogenic bacteria (tubercle bacilli) is possible at any time or space; but the result is not that everyone constitutes this disease. In other words, in the entire human race, there is still a large proportion of people who are not tuberculosis patients; based on this fact, we can also see how important the strength of the body's defense ability is—</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, then, the prevention policy for this disease can be divided into two aspects. The first is to eliminate the pathogenic bacteria in our society; the second is to enable everyone to develop a physique that can defend against pathogenic bacteria even if they enter the body. The former is passive, and the latter is active. Now let's talk about the first one.</p>
<p>We know that the occurrence of ordinary acute infectious diseases generally has its route of epidemic spread; if we talk about patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the most important and easiest medium for spreading is the "sputum" of the patients—the number of bacteria contained in it is quite alarming. According to precise statistics from experts, the amount of sputum coughed up by a seriously ill patient at one time is close to 300 million. If we calculate the sputum excreted in one day and night, it needs to be increased dozens of times more, which is enough to invade and spread infinitely to other healthy people. One patient is already like this in the short term, let alone all the patients—so if we want to eliminate tubercle bacilli, the first thing we should do is deal with the sputum of patients; moreover, regarding the patient's excreted feces, clothing, utensils, books, living rooms, etc., there is no place without the existence of tubercle bacilli. Strict sterilization procedures should be used; each method and situation will be discussed later. But perhaps someone must ask: After such strict sterilization procedures, will tubercle bacilli be completely eliminated? Will the route of spread of this disease be cut off from now on? This is certainly not successful. Ordinary acute infectious diseases such as cholera and plague may be possible: because these diseases are often limited to a certain place and spread, and their transmission routes are also relatively clear. Pulmonary tuberculosis cannot be compared with them at all. First, tubercle bacilli have a coating of fatty or waxy substances, and their resistance is very strong, so they are extremely difficult to kill. Even sunlight, their greatest enemy, can fly up when it shines on them and spread to other places. Secondly, tubercle bacilli are not only present in the bodies of patients with this disease, but also everywhere in the bodies of ordinary healthy people; to put it bluntly: in any human room, it is absolutely impossible to guarantee that there is no tubercle bacillus—so just contacting humans is almost the same as contacting tubercle bacilli; if you want to avoid contact with tubercle bacilli, unless you completely break off contact with humans, which is impossible for anyone—then, it goes without saying that the so-called extermination of tubercle bacilli in society cannot become a reality!</p>
<h3>Introduction to Domestic Rubber Plaster</h3>
<p>Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory has recently self-produced Changming brand rubber plaster. Most of the materials used are domestic products, and experts are hired to guide the manufacturing method. Therefore, the viscosity is extremely strong, it is durable for storage, and the packaging is divided into five types, with all sizes available. It is indeed a good domestic product, so it is specially introduced.</p>

Bids at 20 and 66 were the most common, and sales at 16 and 35 were more common, rising by five fen, a jiao to three jiao and a half. In the next plate, No. 66 continued to buy in, and Nos. 11 and 47 also had considerable demand. Retail investors had a particularly strong appetite, continuing to rise by one or two jiao to four jiao and a half. After the market opened in the afternoon, No. 54 suddenly had a huge demand. Nos. 4, 11, and 47 also had appetite from time to time. Retail investors covered their positions very enthusiastically. No. 35 continued to gain ground. Type D this month actually surged to 63 yuan and 3 jiao, a sharp increase of 1 yuan and 2 jiao. The rest also increased by three, four, or five jiao. Type E also rose by seven jiao and a half. The market had calmed down at the close. Types E and D were slightly weak. Type C rose near the end and long term, but the long term for Type A rose another 3 jiao, discovering a new high price of 67 yuan and 2 jiao. Nos. 5, 23, and 35 bought in, and the trend has become stable. This kind of market price will either rise or fall, and it is difficult to stabilize. As a result, the market price continued to rise across the board, increasing by seven jiao and a half to one yuan and two jiao. No. 96 also increased by one or two jiao, while Jin Chang was only slightly more than half a yuan. The total number of transactions was 8.38 million yuan. Here is a list of the results of the price increases and decreases, in comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Poor First Quarter Profits, Transactions on the New York Stock Market Are Extremely Stagnant</h3>
<p>Transactions on the New York stock market are extremely stagnant, with mixed price increases and decreases. The first quarter profit reports of some companies were very poor, such as the profits of ten auto parts companies being 18% lower than last year, and the profits of construction materials companies being 28% lower than last year. Steel stocks other than Wolds were mixed. Auto, oil, and silver stocks were still positive, while a few fell. The small exchange and the bond market fell slightly. Half-day trading volume was 810,000 shares. Here is a list of the Dow Jones New York indices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Although Actual Sales Are Improving, Yarn Futures Are Still Depressed, Actually Suppressed by the Recent Period</h3>
<p>The yarn market is unable to recover and is completely unexciting. The market is unusually depressed and morale is low. The delivery period for April futures is approaching, with only five trading days left. It is rumored that there are about 3,000 bales of new delivery chips. The recipients are probably still arbitraging.</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Falls by Four or Five Jiao</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with slight increases in each month, but the market situation was very calm. Transactions on the floor were very scarce. After the second plate, it turned down again. As a result, each month fell by 2.3.4.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the market opened in the afternoon, the market state was extremely flat and weak. Transactions were silent. However, the business of actual yarn was relatively improved, and demand in the south developed. However, the market sentiment was depressed due to the delivery relationship this month. As a result, each month fell by one or three jiao compared to the morning closing price. Check the sales records of 500 bales from Tongji, 900 bales from Daji, 550 bales from Xiecheng, 900 bales from Hengchang, 350 bales from Renfeng, 350 bales from Dafu, and 350 bales from Xincheng. The purchases were 900 bales from Dafeng, 450 bales from Mingde, 350 bales from Senkang, 500 bales from Tonghe, 500 bales from Jinchang, and 950 bales from Shenji. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>South China Yarn Sales Are Active Actual yarn sales are still quite thin, and purchases in South China are improving. Check the statistics of all the gangs buying a total of 2,094 bales throughout the day. The selling price is firm. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Atmosphere Calm</h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish, with no clear gains or losses to be seen. However, Indian cotton has been steadily rising recently, and the trend for American cotton is also good. Market sentiment is lackluster, mainly due to rumors circulating in the market about a potential loan negotiation involving American wheat, leading to a lack of buyers. Only Tong Kee is gradually increasing its purchases, having already reached 95,000 bales.</p>
<p>Minor Fluctuations in Traded Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton futures market opened higher due to the strength of American cotton, rising by 4 to 7 pounds. Indian cotton coarse yarn showed particularly strong upward momentum, rising by 0.5 to 2 rupees. Osaka's three-brand cotton futures fell by one yuan after a squeeze earlier this month. Market sentiment was calm. After the second session, it was reported that the yarn market was weak, and the delivery of coarse yarn for this month was abundant, creating significant pressure. It is said that the bulls are also preparing to take delivery, so the situation for this month is still firm. As a result, the current month's contract closed five points higher than the previous day, while the distant months remained unchanged. In the afternoon session, the market opened sluggishly. As a result, the near month remained unchanged, while the distant months fell by one jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,100 bales of Ji Feng, 1,200 bales of Jin Chang, 1,000 bales of Quan Xing, 1,800 bales of Shen Ji, 1,000 bales of Sheng Yuan, 1,600 bales of Xin Cheng, 1,200 bales of Ming De, 2,000 bales of Run Kang, and 1,200 bales of Yuan Xing Chang. Purchases included 1,000 bales of Tong Fu, 2,700 bales of Tong Kee, 2,600 bales of Chang Feng, 1,900 bales of Yi Kang, and 2,100 bales of Chang He. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Stalled - Spot Trading Stagnant, Factory Demand Quiet</p>
<p>Spot consumption is stagnant, and factory demand is quiet. The source of Yao cotton is 250 bales, Tong cotton is 280 bales. Bao cotton is at 56.75.  Ri Hua Factory intake is 168 pieces, spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Last Week, Indian Cotton Spot Prices Gradually Strengthened</h3>
<p>Indian cotton spot prices strengthened last week. Although overseas market news was good, due to pessimistic views on the American cotton government plan, "White Luo Creek" could not catch up. The price difference between "White Luo Creek" and American cotton widened. However, Japan's demand for all types of cotton is strong, so prices are very firm in the near term. The May contracts for Oumula and Pingguoer are showing strength. The April-May "White Creek" contracts are being covered by short sellers. Japanese exporters are buying in large quantities, which has also turned prices firm and high. With support from China and Japan, "White Luo Creek" spot prices are gradually strengthening, and short sellers are no longer pressing the market. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>
<h3>Three-Brand Yarn Falls, Cotton Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram of the 20th: Three-brand yarn futures fell by 2 to 8 jiao, with the near month at 196.3 yuan and the distant month at 196.9 yuan. Distant cotton rose by 1 jiao to falling 1.1 yuan, with the near month at 64.75 yuan and the distant month at 61.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains - Sunny Weather Weakens Flour and Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, prices for all months were stable initially, but then showed signs of softening. Because overseas wheat quotations, Chicago near-term rose 4 jiao and far-term rose more than 7 jiao, and Canada rose 2.3 jiao, the initial prices stabilized people's hearts. Soon after, the weather became exceptionally favorable, and wheat seedlings sprouted very quickly everywhere, so some of the bulls gradually sold off, and market sentiment weakened. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were not brisk, but the bulls continued to sell off, and small factories also slightly sold off distant months, so prices for all months fell another fen. Going forward, the rise of the overseas wheat market will inevitably have a pull effect.</p>
<p>When the wheat market opened this morning, prices for all months were stable. Although overseas wheat was high, the domestic weather was good, and the impression of the wheat seedlings was very good, so the industry and outsiders were all calm. Although there were no large-scale sell-offs, the trend for all months was downward, falling 2 to 3 fen compared to the previous week. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions gradually became active, because market sentiment was also weak, and bids were slightly soft again. If the weather does not change and the wheat seedlings thrive, the wheat market may weaken. Because the factories have no appetite, no spot wheat has been delivered.</p>
<p>The overseas wheat market continues to be dry, with no rain forecast. If it does not rain on Sunday, it may rise again on Monday. It is expected that the bulls will take profits at that time. Flour sales and spot demand are both strong.</p>
<h3>客秈 Rice Arrives and is Quickly Cleared</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the momentum of 客秈 rice was not strong. The source was mostly Jiangxi, but the number arriving recently was only several hundred bags. 米 from 温台 had an intention of being shipped to Shanghai to be sold because of the weather gradually getting hot. However, most of the cargo owners are currently insisting on holding and are unwilling to sell easily, but the appetite for those importing it is weak, so yesterday 84 bags of 成交 米 and 830 bags of 温台 rice were sold, totaling less than 1000 bags. Prices are still similar to those of the previous market because both parties are adamant, so the market has remained stable.</p>
<h3>河下 Rice Sales Clear but Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>(沪南) Yesterday, the total number of sources from various gangs was more than ten (totaling more than 4,000 shi). The sales market in this street is still dull. Tianjin and Qingdao gangs only handle 1,600-1,700 bags, so the market continues to be weak. The price of 厚早粳 rice fell by about a corner again, 薄稻 短 rice fell by a corner, and 社洋尖 rice also softened. 陰變元 is flat and tired.</p>
<p>(沪南) Yesterday, the number of sources from various routes in 河下 was unknown. The market for various goods is still weak. The market price for 白粳 is high, and the middle and second grades are slightly lower by 角许. 薄稻 is also tired by about 角,羊杜埠尖 price is tired by 五六分, 客尖 is tired by 小三四分, 陰 定立, 白元 price is 小一二角, and the prices of other goods are weak.</p>
<h3>Oil and Soybean Cake Both See Declines</h3>
<p>The oil and soybean cake market has declined compared to last week. Because after the surge, actual sales have plummeted, and the market is bearish. However, the goal of soybean oil is that the source will not surge, and people's hearts are not easily over-inflated, and yesterday it fell 角许. The spot market has not opened yet, only 成交 大连 oil 100 pieces for 2-3 days, soybeans also have no big appetite, and the market price is falling by about 角. It is estimated that 3 carts of 四平街 beans, 400 bags of 浦東杜豆 and 110 bags of 崇明沙黃 are opening, soybean cake is only sporadic sales, 成交 四牌 cake 3000 jin, and prices fell 四分.</p>
<h3>Seafood - All Goods Sold Out Immediately Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>(Shortage of Shrimp Tails in Both Arrival and Inventory) The inventory of 金鈎尾 in this port has been exhausted. According to Hong Kong telegrams yesterday, it has risen by 5 yuan compared to last week. The cost of marking in Shanghai is about 120 yuan. The firm's goods have been tightened. Yesterday, the market price for large, good goods was 112 yuan, at least 110 yuan, and the price for the unified goods was 106-107 yuan. The goods of 金山尾 had been cleared. Yesterday, 32 barrels of small, ordinary goods arrived, and the numbers were opened at 124 yuan. The price of 田扁尾 was also opened at 8 pieces, the price being 109 yuan, and the price of 田蝦 was 4 pieces, the price being 98.5 yuan. The market prices of the various stalls were raised by 50 yuan or 10 yuan compared to before, and there were many people who wanted the goods. It is said that the numbered goods were sold out according to the number, and the price may rise again in the future. National shrimp tails such as Yantai, Wenzhou, Jiangbei, Tianjin, etc., Singapore Xiangshan, Japanese 元東, and 朝鮮 東 are now rare in both arrival and inventory, and the market is firm, and the prices are the same as before, with no changes.</p>
<p>(Seaweed Sales Bids Rise) The weather is stepping up, and customer sales are gradually booming, and the base goods of the various stalls are not enough, and those with inventory are temporarily unwilling to sell them, waiting for goodness, and the sales bids are gradually high, and the market price of 大方玻璃紫菜 at 馆 is 155 yuan, 中方 123 yuan, 高货 110 yuan for 小方, sub-grades 90 yuan, 州 小方 82 yuan, 外出货 for Ningbo is 110 yuan for the top grade, 90 yuan for the unified hand, and 70 yuan to 85 yuan for the 象山 goods.</p>
<p>(Inventory of 哈士蟆 is less than 1,000 jin) In recent years, production has increased greatly, and demand has also become more popular than before, although the source is surging, but the customer road also expands gradually, and it goes away as soon as it arrives, and there is little inventory left. The market price of large, good red-bellied goods from Jilin is 200 yuan, the original unified goods are 180 yuan, large 安东 goods are 175 yuan, medium are 160 yuan, and 高丽 goods are 150-160 yuan. Currently, the street inventory is less than 1,000 jin in total, and if there are batches of major customers, it is feared that there will be a shortage of goods to supply.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - European Sales Not Smooth, Yokohama Silk Telegram Futures and Spot Prices Both Fall, Shanghai Silk Market Also Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York was closed on Sunday, and the Yokohama telegrams indicated that silk prices fell another five yuan and futures prices fell fifteen yuan. Overseas silk sales have not been smooth. Although Jardine Matheson and Sin Fung advanced 40 bales of white factory silk, the prices were still clear. However, due to the stagnant overseas silk market, the silk telegrams issued by various export firms were rarely traded. As a result, the Shanghai silk market has gradually weakened.</p>
<h3>Qimen New Tea on the Market</h3>
<p>Due to the warm weather in recent days, the tea buds of the new Qimen black tea are developing rapidly. Most of the sunny mountain areas have already sprouted leaves. Each tea household has started picking on the 18th. The tea making houses have already started collecting green leaves in order to rush to make tribute tea for foreign companies to sell.</p>
<h3>Suian Green Tea Also Emerging</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's Suian green tea, in recent years, tea-making houses have adopted the method of collecting green leaves. Therefore, mountain households are practicing early picking. According to the news obtained by the tea gang yesterday, new green tea has also emerged. Tea factories such as Dadechang, Yichengxiang, and Gong Sheng in this city have sent people to rush to collect and purchase.</p>
<p>Sugar Market - The Inventory of Foreign Sugar in this City is Increasing (as of April 18)</p>
<h3>Metals - Green Lead Market Firm</h3>
<p>Recently, the green lead market has been very good because of the promotion of the tea shop gang. However, the inventory is thin and people are confident. The market price is quite good, and the market price is 23.5 yuan per dan. Yesterday, the market opened more than 400 pieces, opened by a metal shop on North Suzhou Road. In addition, I heard that the business of printing houses and type houses has also made progress.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous arrival of goods in the Hunan lead market, the market atmosphere is stable. The standard opening price, so it is not easy to improve, and it is still 21.5 yuan per dan. I heard that the transaction is only 70-80 pieces, which are handled by the mainland gang.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Palise Cloth Sales Extremely Strong - Pale Gray More Short</h3>
<p>Palise cloth, recently, many local customers have produced products, and retail clippings in stores and suit tailor-made clothing businesses have also increased day by day. Both Eastern and Western goods are selling well. Among domestic goods, such as Hongsheng brand goods, production is overwhelmed. Western goods are commonly sold for 4.12 yuan, and Eastern goods are currently sold for 1.65 yuan per yard in the whole box, and 5 fen or 1 jiao is added to the color selection of each piece. Chengdu Gang and Jiangxi Changsha Gang, Beijing-Hangzhou Second Road and Hankou Gang have all purchased goods, and the market situation is very active, and pale gray colors are more short.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous - Raw Starch Thin Inventory, Low Sales, Market Stable</h3>
<p>Raw starch is produced in the Dutch East Indies and imported to China. It has been only twenty years. In the beginning, only a few were shipped to be used for making dishes and thickening, and the grading and manufacturing steps were broadened. Countries such as Britain, Russia, Japan and the United States have also successively imitated and competed with each other, and the production has increased greatly. The number of goods transported and sold domestically is very large. According to last year's import statistics, it is about more than 100,000 dan, worth 1 million yuan. Although it is a lower-level general import goods, the annual leakage is also alarming. It was not until last year that domestic Wenzhou goods were produced to抵貨之銷, but the manufacturing art is not top-notch, and the color is inferior, so its 銷 cannot be compared with foreign goods. Fortunately, the dividing line is light and the price is cheap, and it can抵頡 also with foreign goods. The current market price for domestic Wenzhou goods is 11.2 yuan for No. 1, 10.08 yuan for No. 2, and 16 yuan for No. 1 Fiqilin brand for Dutch products, 15.3 yuan for Human Gun brand, 9.5 yuan to 9 yuan for No. 3 Hand brand and Three Fish Three, etc., 11 yuan for No. 1 goods from the East. Currently, the inventory of each goods is not enough, but the daily customer sales are flat and the market is less glorious, and if the market turns strong, there is a possibility of rising.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Cold)</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Takashin Murofushi of Japan said, "When the long history of marriage will end cannot be predicted today, but the end of the form of marriage that exists today is approaching. I think it can be determined with great precision today."</p>
<p>Most people say that love is dark and base, but as I see it, love is bright, because those without love are like withered trees in autumn, hoping for the arrival of spring.</p>
<p>The Arab rules for criticizing female beauty are: the hair, eyebrows, pupils, and eyelashes should be black; the head, neck, ankles, and forearms should be round; the skin, whites of the eyes, teeth, and legs should be white; and the tongue, lips, gums, and cheeks should be red. Black, round, white, and red must all conform to the above regulations to be a true beauty.</p>
<p>Love is just a beautiful noun, either for a mutually beneficial relationship or to satisfy sexual desire. To be honest, how many people can truly have love? Therefore, old Mr. Wu Zhihui said it well: "To resolutely say that love between men and women is purely sexual desire."</p>
<p>"Love is the key to life. Only after having love can there be life. If love is taken away, then what is the meaning of life?" This is the Japanese Kitamura Tokoku's comment on love. Indeed, this is a true criticism.</p>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The term "help" can be said to be the most common in Chinese society, especially in the mouths of Shanghainese. You can hear this tone anytime, anywhere. According to the principles of human survival, people should have a spirit of mutual assistance. Think about how turbulent life is and how complex the world is. For the public, for the private, for others, and for oneself, everyone is in a chaotic encirclement. Even the so-called leisure class has things to do, but what they do is to pursue entertainment, which is commonly known as "busy with nothing."</p>
<p>Since everyone is busy, who can help whom? However, busyness has varying degrees of urgency. Gradual busyness can be dealt with calmly over time, but if you encounter a major matter that must be done well in a short period of time, and because of the scarcity of manpower, this is urgent busyness. At this time, you must ask your close friend to help.</p>
<p>The scope of other help is also very broad. For example, things that benefit Party A and do not harm Party B, but can achieve the goal with a simple effort, are also called help. We should not refuse to do what we can. However, there is one type of help that is the most difficult and accounts for the majority of help requests, which is "borrowing money" or "collecting debts." Before the money is borrowed or the debt is collected, you should at least ask the other party to help. Although it is impossible to predict whether the other party will accept your request, given your position, you have no choice but to make a polite request. This may be a small philosophy of life.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting Peach Blossoms at Little Putuo Temple in Taicang</h3>
<p>— Dai Yuren</p>
<p>Visiting peach blossoms on a spring outing is a joyful event. I also drove there. From my home (West Shanghai), I followed the Xihu Road to Taicang South Station, which was about thirty-five miles away. The car arrived in about an hour. From the station, I advanced along a small road. Peach forests were everywhere along the way, stretching for hundreds of acres. Lingering in the red rain, it was as if I were in a peach blossom paradise. Beside the shallow water, a few plum trees were planted intermittently, and they were also in full bloom, with trees full of white, which embellished them quite a bit. After walking for about a mile, I arrived at Little Putuo. Temporary tea rooms were specially set up on Xihu Road, and a "Tickling Peach Garden Vegetable Society" was set up in the temple. We had lunch here, tasted the local specialty "chicken gall fire gluten noodles," which were very delicious, and purchased a few local specialties such as "dregs of meat floss." The temple enshrines Guanyin Bodhisattva, and it happens to be in Nandu, hence the name Little Putuo. In front of the temple is a tributary of the Liu River. Across the bank, peach forests are widely planted. There used to be a stone bridge that could connect, but it was destroyed in the January 28th Incident and has not yet been repaired. So we took a boat across. The sunlight reflected, and the flowing water was red. The light boat was slow and leisurely, which was quite interesting. On the opposite bank, the flowing water surrounded thousands of peach and willow trees. Thatched huts and wooden doors, village children in groups of three or five, laughed freely. We jokingly suggested that this place was the old playground of boatmen, so we looked at each other and laughed. Then we returned from the original crossing. On this trip, we were sincerely guided by Mr. Chen Xiatin, a receptionist from the Xihu Road, and he also invited us to visit Wangyuan Park in the city, which added more interest to this trip. I am deeply grateful. In the evening, I returned and wrote this record.</p>
<h3>On the Su-Mu Road</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Every time we come out of our hometown Dongting, we first take a small gasoline boat to Mudu, and then take a Su-Mu inland river steamer to Xumen, and then hire a car to the railway station. Although this is only a short journey, we have to change boats and cars three or four times. If there is no luggage, it is still okay to slip away alone, but sometimes it is troublesome to carry something. Moreover, there is a long distance from the old house to the汽船埠頭, and from the汽車縏埠頭 to the steamer dock. Therefore, during this period, I had to have the luggage sent by the porter, so every time I returned, I felt very painful about this journey.</p>
<p>Recently, roads have been built everywhere to facilitate transportation, so the Su-Mu Road was also completed last year. The Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company has officially opened to traffic there, so I took the highway this time and back instead of staying in 可. Although it has not reached the general convenience in my ideal, it is indeed much easier than before.</p>
<p>The bus route passes through Suzhou Railway Station, through Changmen, Xumen, and West Kuatang, to Mudu, and at the foot of Jianwan Lingyan Mountain. The original fare from Suzhou Railway Station to Mudu was set at 3.5角, but now it is reduced by 20%, and luggage is free.</p>
<p>The two times I rode, there weren't many people, but because of the insufficient horsepower of the engine and the unevenness of the road, the car body shook very badly. When we sat inside, we felt a little like the car was about to overturn. The lungs in our stomachs were also agitated, especially for several elderly women, it was really unbearable.</p>
<p>When the car was running, the sound was very loud, almost shattering the ear wax, and the brain was also agitated and pained.</p>
<p>From this ride, I feel that the Su-Mu Road Bureau should not only consider the convenience of transportation, but also pay more attention to the safety of passengers. For example, the many incomplete roads should be completed as soon as possible, and some of the extra stones on the road need to be removed. Otherwise, this will cause headaches and fear for general travelers.</p>
<h3>Record of What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Di Xiuzhi)</p>
<p>I recently read in this column that Mr. Biji wrote that he often encountered a very slow middle-aged man on and around Simar Road and Nanjing Road, always holding an unusual envelope, asking people where Yangshupu was. The author has also encountered it many times. In order to clarify the secrets, he followed the man to Jiutai Cigarette Paper Store on the west side of the Central Grand Theater on Liuma Road, and then he completely broke through the secrets. I will write this down to tell the readers. (The following is a conversation with the middle-aged man.)</p>
<p>"I (the middle-aged man claimed) am from the north (he refused to announce his name). I am now on Huanghe Road. I used to serve as a company commander in a certain division of the Northeast Army. When the September 18th Incident occurred, I went through several battles and was sent to the rear hospital for treatment due to injuries. I fully intended to be discharged from the hospital and continue to serve the country. Unexpectedly, the Northeast territory soon changed color, and I was unable to continue fighting on the battlefield due to injuries to my buttocks. There are still a wife and two children in my family. The two children are still young and life is difficult. Therefore, I came to Shanghai with my wife and two children to make a living. However, I am unfamiliar with Shanghai and have no place to insert my feet. I had no choice but to go to the bustling roads every day, pretending to be lost on the way to Yangshupu, feigning physical weakness, unable to walk, and eager to catch a car, begging passers-by for a few copper coins to provide for the livelihood of my family." After he said this, he showed me the wounds he had suffered in the war to show me, and then bought an envelope in the cigarette paper store, entrusting the store clerk to write the words "Mr. So-and-So, So-and-So Road, Yangshupu... Receive" on it. The person is also a pitiful worm.</p>
<p>Miscellany</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Relief Association's Fortune Fruit Tickets</h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Last year, rivers and streams overflowed in various regions, and the number of disaster-stricken people affected reached the millions. In particular, the severity of the floods in various areas of northern Jiangsu was greater than in other regions. Now, this spring, it is the time for plowing and cultivation. The disaster victims, having received emergency and winter relief last year, managed to survive. At this time, if spring relief is not urgently implemented to enable farmers to cultivate their land, this year's livelihood will inevitably become unbearably difficult. Therefore, the importance of spring relief at this time outweighs that of emergency and winter relief. Failure to plan for relief would negate all previous efforts in disaster relief. The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces is working hard to raise funds for spring relief because of this point. Coincidentally, there is a great philanthropist in Suzhou, Old Madam Yao, who destroyed her home to aid in relief. She completely donated all her properties in Haihongfang Garden—bungalows—land—jewelry—worth over 60,000 yuan for spring relief purposes. Therefore, the Goods Relief Association was established to issue a type of Fortune Fruit Ticket. On the one hand, it solicits donations of prizes from various sectors. On the other hand, it uses fundraising to issue Fortune Fruit Tickets. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. The detailed information about these Fortune Fruit Tickets, which benefit disaster victims, is recorded below.</p>
<p>Fortune Fruit Ticket Method—The issuance of Fortune Fruit Tickets is now in its second round. The first round was issued in 1928, organized by Wang Yiting, with a fixed amount of 20,000 tickets. The top prize was the authentic calligraphy of the Thirteen Hongs from the Sanxitang rare collection. This time, it's slightly different from the last time. The Chairman of the Committee is Zhu Qinglan, the current Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee. The Director of the Office is Cheng Jingsheng, a member of the Relief Committee. The Deputy Directors are Yuan Weimei and Jin Shaowu. The Standing Committee members include Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, all famous figures experienced in relief work. The greatness of their dedicated efforts is self-evident. This time, the number of Fortune Fruit Tickets is 12,000, and for every donation of 10 yuan for spring relief, one ticket is given, totaling 120,000 yuan. The highest prize is a house in Haihongfang Garden in Suzhou donated by Old Madam Yao, worth 50,000 yuan. The second prize is 560 mu of fertile land in Tongyun Port donated by Mu Fenjun, worth 18,000 yuan. Other prizes include cars, bungalows, land, jewelry, antiques, calligraphy and paintings by famous people, daily necessities, and all kinds of items. Each Fortune Fruit Ticket will surely receive one or several prizes. Therefore, philanthropists who donate for relief and receive Fortune Fruit Tickets "both sow the seeds of fortune and reap the fruits of joy," truly a good deed with double benefits.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Solicits Donations—The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that Fortune Fruit Tickets are an extremely important disaster relief effort, related to the life and death of disaster victims, and must be undertaken with united efforts to achieve good results. After negotiations between Cheng Jingsheng, Director of the Goods Relief Association Office, and Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, Advisor, and Xu Ji, etc., the task of unified fundraising was undertaken by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They solicit donations of prizes, encourage subscriptions for relief funds, and accept Fortune Fruit Tickets. The set amount is 3,000 Fortune Fruit Tickets and 6,000 items. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's enthusiasm for disaster relief is evident here.</p>
<p>Number of Tickets Subscribed—A total of 12,000 Fortune Fruit Tickets are available, and for every donation of 10 yuan, one ticket is given. Since the start of fundraising, the excellent results have exceeded expectations. The number of tickets subscribed has reached over 11,800, leaving only a little over 100 tickets. Therefore, philanthropists who wish to sow the seeds of fortune and reap good results by May 1 must accept Fortune Fruit Tickets as soon as possible, otherwise, they will regret it. The two largest subscribers are the Jiangsu Provincial Government with 3,000 tickets and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with 3,000 tickets. The remaining subscriptions include 1,000 tickets from the local Exchange Association and Exchange Broker Association, 1,000 tickets solicited by Zhu Qinglan in Nanjing, 1,500 tickets jointly subscribed by Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, and Liu Zhenhua, 300 tickets by Cheng Jingsheng, 200 tickets by Wang Yiting, and multiple tickets each by Xiong Bingsan, Yu Baoqing, and Zhu Shaoping. In addition, Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin are both charitable and have solicited many subscriptions. The total number has already exceeded 11,800, and it is expected that all tickets can be fully subscribed in a short time.</p>
<p>List of Prizes—Fortune Fruit Tickets must reach certain levels to have a chance of winning prizes. In addition to real estate in Suzhou and land in Lianyungang, there are not enough prizes to distribute. Therefore, there is an active solicitation from various sectors. Currently, in addition to the 6,000 items donated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, over 2,000 items have been received, many of which are extremely valuable. In terms of antiques, Mr. Wang Zhensheng donated eight items, including a Han bronze touhu (pitch-pot game), a Han bronze washbasin, a Zhou-made large enclosing screen, a Zhou-made medium-sized inserted screen, a carved small inserted screen, a Kangxi carved porcelain blue dragon incense burner, a Qianlong enamel inserted screen, and Lingbi stones. Wu Yunqi donated an antique porcelain vase. There are countless calligraphy and paintings by famous people, including Tang Yin, Fei Danxu, the Four Wangs, Prince Cheng, and Mi Nan Gong, Qian Nanyuan, etc. There is no shortage of daily necessities such as thermos flasks, glass cups, cigarettes, etc. In the future, every ticket will have excellent and valuable prizes, which is not a problem. This is also the result of the great enthusiasm of all sectors for disaster relief and the immeasurable merit of all philanthropists. Because the disaster victims in the disaster area are being helped, they can cultivate their land and solve their livelihood problems.</p>
<h3>A Nest of Lovebirds</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near Double Ninth Festival, Seeking Serenity in a Small Gathering; Weaving Old Dreams Like Pearls, Drinking Sadly for a Thousand Years</p>
<p>It is said that the pangs of longing are difficult to cure, only divination can ease them. Drinking wine endlessly, let us return to a drunken stupor. Though the seas may dry and stones may crumble, we still make vows for the next life. As flowers fall and cuckoos cry, only regret remains for today.</p>
<p>It is said that unless Qingfu is eliminated, the tragedy of Lu will persist. Unless the Xiongnu are destroyed, how can there be a home?</p>
<p>I was looking down at these poems, one by one, when Lan Chang said to himself: "As flowers fall and cuckoos cry, only regret remains for today; of the two, one must go." This matter is very ordinary, but only after each has asserted themselves, and there is the standing on the upper floor until dusk, unwilling to become mud, is this a page of struggle. If we focus on this and continue the novel, it would also be a kind of writing that is inevitable in this transitional era." I said: "That's for sure. We must understand that the person who entrusted me to write this novel hopes that we will sympathize with him, so naturally we must write it in a way that makes the readers sympathize too." He then pressed his hand on the poems and said with a smile: "I don't want to read any more. If I read any more, I'll know almost the whole story of the book, and it won't be interesting to read your novel later." I smiled and said: "You seem very interested. Why don't you give the novel a name?" Lan Chang said: "A name? Just look for it in these twenty-four Linked Pearls." Hearing this, I truly picked up the twenty-four Linked Pearls and carefully examined them for a while. The last poem had the words "Nest, Phoenix, Remembering Parting, Mud." So I clapped my hands and said, "I've got it, I've got it! Let's call it 'A Nest of Lovebirds'." With these four words, the meaning of "reluctant parting, mud, cloud" is already in it. Lan Chang held his teacup, took a sip, thought for a moment, and nodded with a smile: "Very good, this is capturing the essence without using a single word. Although it has some classical colors, these four words are still popular. It's also appropriate for the sake of being ambiguous." I said: "It's not like that. We writers always sympathize with the people in the book. If we express our opinions in the title, it may not be satisfactory to the readers. It's better to just state the facts and let others judge." Lan Chang said: "In that case, you won't criticize the people in the book?" I smiled and said:</p>
<p>"The willow branches extend beyond the palace walls, inviting others to gossip about their affairs."</p>
<p>Lan Chang seemed to accept my meaning, and reached out to shake my hand. Our conversation ended here, and what follows is the story of the people in the book. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Where to Go After Giving Up This Body?</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Wang Zhuer, a long-term worker at Diaoyutai, who killed his master Zhang Defu and Zhang Zhao's wife with an axe, was finally sentenced to death by the Supreme Court after three years of litigation that caused a sensation in the ancient capital. He was executed by hanging yesterday by the High Court. Wang Zhuer had been enlightened by members of the Buddhist Association in the detention center. He was already aware. So when he was taken out of the detention center, he asked the jailer to bring out his monastic attire. He put on the gray cloth monastic robe and saffron-yellow monastic shoes, placed the prayer beads over his head, and then, holding a Diamond Sutra in his hand, followed the bailiff onto the car and drove to the execution ground. On the north side of the gallows at the execution ground, a statue of Buddha was also placed, with a pair of white cloth elegiac couplets beside it. The upper line read, "Where to go after giving up this body?" The lower line read, "Seeking Amitabha Buddha to guide the way." That Wang Zhuer, facing the Buddha statue and the elegiac couplets, gave up this body and went to the Western Paradise in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>Usually, condemned prisoners are given wine to drink to reduce their pain during the execution. Some priests also pray for them to go to heaven, but no one believes that nonsense. The reason is very simple. Chinese people have always believed that there is only "Old Man Heaven" in heaven, and there is no so-called "Lord." Most prisoners still drink the strong wine until they are drunk and die. But now, a "prescription is given to the disease," and Buddhist enlightenment is applied. Sure enough, before the execution, Wang Zhuer was not only not afraid of death, but also saw his Western Paradise when he faced the north on the gallows. Look, he loudly recited the sutras to the Buddha statue and kowtowed three times, then stood upright to receive the execution, without any worried look on his face. Isn't that much more effective than the priest's prayers and giving him strong wine to drink?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association has an organization called the "Animal Protection Association" because animals are living beings, and it is too cruel to kill them. So they even advise people to be careful when walking and not to step on ants to death. And now, a heinous prisoner is subjected to the enlightenment of Buddha, so that he does not suffer before the execution and is sent to the "Western Paradise." That is also a compassionate heart of our Buddha—Wang Zhuer did not give up this body in vain.</p>
<h3>Spring Famine</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>It's spring, but. The dry north wind is still blowing lazily. The distant green mountains have such pale grass colors, without any vigorous scenery. It's as if there has been a terrible famine. The songs of birds in the woods have long been unheard of. Perhaps they are afraid that their lives will end in the hands of hungry crowds, or perhaps they have suffered a natural disaster and quietly ended their lives——</p>
<p>The tops of the trees are still whistling, but there is no longer the light and faint singing of the leaves. Looking across, it is completely the scenery of late autumn, so desolate, so tired. The muffled fragrance emanating from the ancient yellow soil layer lightly flutters with the autumn wind in spring. Everything has shown the desolation of returning to the primitive era. The vast plains, grasslands, fields, and riverbeds are all covered with the colors of late autumn.</p>
<p>The people in the villages all show a look of panic.</p>
<p>"Damn it, another spring famine this year—nothing has been harvested, and the fields have become desolate areas."</p>
<p>Young Xiao Sanzi's face is like old yellow earth, as thin as a monkey, with sunken, dead-gray eyes staring. He has no energy anymore. But he is still pointing at the sky, pointing at the earth, pointing at the gods, and saying with foam coming out of his mouth. However, that is of no use to him. He has suffered a month of hunger and a month of cold, just like having had a serious illness, listless and without energy. Leaning against the wall, looking at the sky, and then looking at his dying mother, who is lying on the bed without a quilt, only things composed of broken cotton and cloth pieces, plus dry yellow rice straw. When she heard her son's complaints, she opened her dim eyes and looked from the dark corner, just a matted mess. She sighed.</p>
<p>"You can't complain about the gods—it's our bad fate!"</p>
<p>Xiao Sanzi seemed not to hear it, and looked at everything in the house again. Everything is over. Even the hens that they were reluctant to kill have been eaten... Thinking, he couldn't help but sigh. He wanted to flee, but there was still his mother and little sister. How could he abandon them? When he thought of the brothers from the Zhou family and Ah Guang and their gang, who had gone down the Yangtze River to find a living, his eyes turned red. "However, I heard that dozens of counties are experiencing famine. Isn't it the same death there?"</p>
<p>"Son, where did Xiao Ying go? Be careful she falls into the river—that place is very filthy (meaning there are ghosts). Two days ago, three children from other villages drowned there." The mother still said with such difficulty. "Go find her!"</p>
<p>"She'll come back by herself. I heard that there are sweet potatoes there! Many children have gone there to dig. Maybe she'll bring some back. Tree leaves and bark are not good for you to eat!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl came running from outside. Her face was so frighteningly pale, her mouth was open, and she almost tripped over the steps, gasping for breath and unable to say a word.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Hey—what happened?"</p>
<p>Xiao Sanzi asked in surprise, but his body didn't move.</p>
<p>"I... I went to the riverbank with Sister Qiong, wanting to dig up a couple of sweet potatoes. Oh! It was so scary. I heard Sister Qiong say: "There are ghosts here. Three children went missing two days ago. I don't know where they went!" But we ran not long before we saw three heads in that darkest corner, ah! Bones... It really scared us to death."</p>
<p>Xiao Ying said breathlessly, and Xiao Sanzi's eyes widened in horror.</p>
<p>"We ran away immediately, fleeing for our lives. We even seemed to hear someone saying there, "Girl's meat is the best!" Ah! Our eyes were dizzy!"</p>
<p>Xiao Sanzi's face convulsed, and he sighed, looking at Xiao Ying's bamboo hat, which had many tender grasses with mud roots, and five small eggs, smaller than chicken eggs and larger than bird eggs, with many speckles and fine dots. Xiao Sanzi simply jumped up with joy and shouted:</p>
<p>"Mom, my sister picked up eggs! I'll cook them for you...</p>
<p>The mother's face had a little smile, saying convulsively:</p>
<p>"Give them to Xiao Ying! Give them to Xiao Ying! Poor her!"</p>
<p>In the evening, both Xiao Ying and the mother ate the eggs. Xiao Sanzi only ate grass roots. But not even for two quarters of an hour. The mother and Xiao Ying were poisoned by the eggs and died groaning in pain.</p>
<p>Xiao Sanzi sadly held his head and dragged his legs out of the village:</p>
<p>"Let's go! Are we waiting to die here?" Several young people set out on the road of escape again.</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>— Ma</p>
<p>Mr. Er hasn't been to the teahouse for two days, which is a rare occurrence. It's as surprising as a stranger suddenly appearing in this teahouse. Tea attendant Ah Jiu asks everyone he meets, "Is Mr. Er sick?" or "Has Mr. Er gone out?"</p>
<p>This teahouse originally only catered to a few rare customers, all of whom were influential people in the city. They had money and only wanted comfort and ease. The tea was more than twice as expensive as in ordinary teahouses, but they didn't care. Every day after lunch, they would come to the teahouse dressed neatly, as if drawn by something. Each person had a fixed seat, and some brought their own teapots and tea leaves, everything was as free as at home. Tea attendant Ah Jiu often collected some news from nearby and spoke wildly to please those gentlemen. Like how beautiful someone's daughter-in-law was, or how someone's wife was cheating on her husband. The gentlemen came to the teahouse every day because they couldn't hear those scandalous news at home. Everyone chatted and laughed, and the days passed easily. When the sun set, they would discuss where to go tonight. Someone would invite someone to his house to play cards, and others would go to the private prostitute Mudan's house. So the next day, there would be more material for talk in the teahouse. In the teahouse, none of them were gentlemen.</p>
<p>But no one knew that Mr. Er hadn't been to the teahouse for two days, because his family didn't know where he went. After Mr. Er's cousin told him the results of yesterday's visit, tea attendant Ah Jiu jumped up like a sorcerer, "That's exactly what happened!"</p>
<p>When he saw the gentlemen opening their mouths wide at his words, he deliberately made a grimace, like a small hothead in the City God Temple, walked step by step to the center of the room, and opened his talkative chatterbox:</p>
<p>"Mr. Er is having a love affair. Didn't he say that he saw a woman in Beijing when he returned from visiting the grave last month, how she looked, how beautiful she was. Mr. Er wanted me to find out who's wife she was." He clapped his hands and continued, "That's exactly what happened, he ran to Beijing."</p>
<p>This was the best news, the gentlemen had news to listen to, they dragged Ah Jiu by the shoulders, like a swarm of flies around a sheep, surrounding Ah Jiu in the center. The class distinction between the gentlemen and the tea attendant was now unclear, they pulled and tugged, hoping that Ah Jiu would finish the story. Tea attendant Ah Jiu was a good hand at making up news, and he knew the gentlemen's tastes. Only Ah Jiu would hold back on telling the news. He calmly laughed, and held out a pair of hairy, thick hands to stop the two gentlemen who were closest to him, and said like an elementary school teacher lecturing:</p>
<p>"Slow down, slow down!" Ah Jiu pulled out a cigarette butt from behind his ear, and when his other hand was taking out a match from his pocket, a beautiful cigarette lit with fire reached his hand from the crowd. Ah Jiu didn't try to find out who gave him the cigarette from that hand, and immediately put the cigarette to his lips before telling the gentlemen the news they were waiting for: "How could I not know Mr. Er's temper? He asks for it as soon as he opens his mouth, and he gets it as soon as he closes it. The day he told me what the woman looked like, I went to Beijing that night. Hmph, this is my specialty, I didn't sit for a cup of tea in the Beijing teahouse, and I found out everything clearly." He squinted his eyes and glanced at the gentlemen's faces, "That female head (woman) is a widow. The man died, and there is a blind mother-in-law at home, with no clothes to wear and no food to eat, that's the easiest to deal with. You see," he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger, "Mr. Er likes this kind of thing, if he doesn't rush to Beijing these two days, where else would he go? And he still wants to hide it from his second wife!"</p>
<p>Ah Jiu took a breath, and immediately four or five tender hands patted Ah Jiu's shoulder, and some seemed to be watching a satisfactory play and applauded. Ah Jiu deliberately showed off his skills again and said, "There's nothing Ah Jiu can't do in this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>The gentlemen one by one returned to the rattan chairs, they used their own experience to guess the widow's beauty. Mr. Er's cousin seemed to have thought of something again and suddenly stood up and said:</p>
<p>"Hey, let's go to Mr. Er's house together tonight, and say that we are going to Mr. Er's to play cards, to see how his second wife looks."</p>
<p>Before this proposal was agreed upon, a servant rushed up the stairs like a wild cat. Ah Jiu saw that it was Mr. Er's servant and sang in a kind of grassroots opera tone: "Speaking of Cao Cao, Cao Cao's houseboy arrives..."</p>
<p>The crowd didn't laugh, the servant rushed to Mr. Er's cousin anxiously and said, "Third Young Master, hurry home, Second Young Master went out today and was beaten, Ah Cai from Beijing carried him back on a plank door today..."</p>
<p>Ah Jiu suddenly opened his mouth wide, the gentlemen's faces changed color, and Third Young Master immediately followed the servant downstairs...</p>

<p>With the discussion on downloading national defense dramas reaching a fever pitch, and the national crisis imminent, the drama circles in broadcasting want to show their mission. However, due to objective environmental constraints, what they want to do is not allowed. This is really pitiful!</p>
<p>However, every drama group hopes to be active and awaken the compatriots who are drunk in their dreams within the possible scope. Regardless of whether this meager and weak force is enough or effective, they have not thought about that. They only know to do their best!</p>
<p>"A Patriotic Heart" unfolds the different patriotic hearts of a mother and daughter. The daughter, Tang Yanan, is an enthusiastic patriot, while the mother, Mrs. Tang, is a non-Chinese. Although she is married to a Chinese man, she does not love China. She deeply loves her own country and sometimes even tries to do work that benefits her home country. Because of this, the mother and daughter will absolutely not compromise. In this lack of compromise, the mother and daughter conflict over matters that are different from the interests of both sides. Standing on different positions, both sides abandon the relationship between mother and daughter, resulting in a physical fight. Although the daughter is victorious, the mother's eyes are pierced by glass and she goes blind, completely losing her sight.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News about "Father and Son Heroes"</h3>
<p>— Yulin</p>
<p>According to Wang Cilong's report, "Father and Son Heroes" is one-third completed.</p>
<p>Wei Heling plays a resolute and decisive police captain. Because of his suitable personality, his performance is extremely excellent, and his dialogue is clear and refreshing.</p>
<p>The entire play of "Father and Son Heroes" is a performance of "force."</p>
<p>Zheng Mengxia is on camera for the first time, but her expressions are excellent, her movements are beautiful, and everywhere shows her rich talent.</p>
<p>There are several thousand scenes of police and bandits fighting. In order to pursue realism, real guns are used. The tension is beyond description.</p>
<p>The story has many twists and turns, and the climax has many ups and downs, which is also a feature of "Father and Son Heroes."</p>
<p>Due to the plot, the photography also appears extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The most tense part of the whole play is Wang Yin's investigation of the bandit den, the underground tunnel mechanism scene. Set designer Bao Tianming attaches special importance to this set in order to increase the dramatic power. He is currently focusing on designing drawings in the hope of achieving the set effect.</p>
<p>Wang Naidong plays the bandit leader. According to him, he is more interested in and confident in this type of role, so there is no doubt that he will be able to make a more superior contribution than before.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiu, who was injured in the police-bandit melee scene filmed the day before yesterday, has been able to continue working because it was not a vital injury. However, Wang Zhongkang has not been able to move due to a broken back and is still being treated at the Red Cross Hospital.</p>
<h3>"Tiger" and Ge Zuo Zhi in "The Lost Lamb"</h3>
<h3>Color Film "Songling Enmity Records"</h3>
<p>Creating a New Era for the Film Industry</p>
<p>Paramount's latest film "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" is rumored to be scheduled to premiere at the Grand Brightness Theater starting at 9:15 PM on Wednesday (the 22nd). This film will occupy a very glorious page in film history because it is the first natural color film completely shot outdoors. The scenery and objects on the silver screen are no different from the colors of the original objects. Just talking about the "sunset" scene, this is the first time we have seen the real sunset scene on the screen because when shooting ordinary films, restricted by air conditions, most of the shots are taken at sunrise because black and white films do not distinguish between sunrise and sunset, but color films will not work because the colors of sunrise and sunset are different. Color cameras have already achieved great success in capturing sunset scenes at sunset. Shirvi Schneid is the protagonist of this film. Judging from her previous achievements, we should believe that this film is definitely worth watching.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Security for Actors (Part 2)</p>
<p>But what is the situation in the Chinese film industry? Such basic security seems to still not exist. It seems that only big stars have such "special treatment" of being able to drink a cup of burning wine after being drenched in water. As for extras or basic roles, taking off your wet clothes and letting you warm yourself by the stove is already a heavenly grace. As for falling from a height of more than ten feet and not being unable to get up, that is naturally your luck. If you hurt your waist or injure your leg, you will be given a "pain plaster". As for being sent to the hospital, that is only something that happens when you are "unable to move."</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't matter whether the injury heals completely, whether it will recur after healing, or whether it will become a lifelong problem.</p>
<p>However, under the big banner of "sacrificing for art," under the smiles of bosses making money, is that all the treatment an actor receives?</p>
<p>Actors, and other film workers, where is your security?</p>
<p>No matter how poor Chinese films are, actors should at least have such meager security, and film workers who are actors should at least stand up and strive for such meager security.</p>
