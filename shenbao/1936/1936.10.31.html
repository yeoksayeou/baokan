<h3>中宣部發告國人書</h3>
<p>（南京）中央宜傳部爲獻機祝壽發吿國人書、原文如下、</p>
<p>今歲十月三十一日、爲本黨領袖蔣委員長五旬初度之辰、舉國上下、莫不鼓舞歡忻、奔走相吿、因發於欽仰擁護之誠、迺有獻機申祝之舉、此數月問、國人踴躍輸募、購機呈獻、惟恐或後、其熱烈之狀、實空前所未有、此乃蔣委員長之偉績豐功、仁心盛德、有以戚召而致、非偶然也、</p>
<p>乃者蔣委員長節的爲懷、謙遜有加、雅不願以一人之生辰、使社會多所糜費、曉諭全國、停北慶祝、此其恭讓之德、允足爲舉世矜式、惟就吾國民言之、今茲之集欵購機、奉獻國家、純以發於愛戴領袖及充實國防之熱忱、而不能自已、此與世俗之稱觴獻頌、逈乎不同、固自有其重大之意義存焉、敬舉數點、以吿國人，</p>
<p>一、獻機慶祝、乃所以表示國民之竭誠擁護領袖也，民國成立以來、國步艱難、外患內憂、交相煎迫、賴蔣委員長繼承、總理遺志、領導國民革命、義師所至、舉國風從、軍閥餘孽、遂吿肅淸、繼以赤燄髙張、數省淪陷、遂復馳驅戎馬、剿撫兼施、經數年之艱苦奮鬥、各省赤禍、相繼敉平、乃盡全力銳意建設、鞏固國基、於以完成全國統一之局面、開民國史上之新紀元、此允爲我國民所不能一日忘者、値茲誕辰、全國一致、獻機祝壽、正所以伸擁護領袖、愛黨愛國之忱也、</p>
<p>二、獻機慶祝、乃所以表示國民自動努力充實國防也、近代軍事及交通利器、首重航空、所謂「無空防卽無國防、」洵非虛語、法國福煦大將之言曰、『世界第二决大戰、將决勝於空中』、誠以今後之戰爭、已由平面的而進爲立體的、非僅恃陸海軍作戰所能奏功、而將來大戰之最後勝負、必將於空軍卜之、蓋空軍之爲用、不獨可摧毀敵人於前綫、抑亦能破壞敵軍之後防、觀乎最近世界列强、莫不以經營空軍爲莫大之急務、職是故也、吾國國防空虛、實力不足、已爲無可諱言之事實、誠欲救國圖存、首當以充實空防爲基礎、况發展空軍、其費用省而效力大、全國人民苟能踴躍輸將、不難計日而覩成效、是則今日之獻機祝壽、實不啻爲吾民族「自力更生」之發軔、亦卽吾國人自動充實國防之表現、質言之、吾人卽視此舉爲發展空防之嚆矢、固無不可也、</p>
<p>三、獻機慶祝、乃所以表示國民之擁護和平統一也，國內統一、爲救國之初步工作、此已爲憂國人士之所共識、過去吾國國力衰弱之主因、良由不能團結統一、有以致之、十年以還、蔣委員長在內憂外患之中、爲國馳驅、卒使舉國人心之意嚮、趨於一致、全國統一之局面、賴以永奠、迄乎今日、國人咸曉然於非精誠團結不足以救亡、此實足認爲全國人心覺醒之朕兆、自今以後、吾中華民族、已開始獲得自救救國之基本力量矣、推其所以然之由、非賴蔣委員長偉大精神之所感召、及其艱苦奮鬥所得來之成績、誠莫克以臻此、是以獻機祝壽之舉、更可認爲國民慶祝和平統一與鞏固精誠團結之表現、固不僅以示國人擁護領袖充實國防之熱誠已也、</p>
<p>抑更有進者、吾國民於獻機慶祝蔣委員長五秩誕辰之際、允有當深切體認者一事焉、自全國統一以後、果宜若何鞏固國基、及若何復興民族、經緯萬端、咸待戮力、從此國民之責任、日益加重、則吾領袖之仔肩、亦日益艱鉅、觀乎蔣委員長之宵旰勤勞、不遑寗處、其刻苦辛勤公忠體國之精神、與百折不回之毅力、實予國人以共見、吾人旣竭誠擁戴領袖、卽當體念目下國家所處之環境、與吾領袖謀國之苦心、自茲舉國一致、在領袖指導之下、以絕對之信仰、奉行領袖之主張、以一貫之赤誠、更作持續之奮鬥、一切舉動、咸當以整個民族之最大福利爲出發點、如新生活運動、國民經濟建設運動、節的運動、勞動服　諸端、皆目前當務之急、循此邁進、庶幾國運日臻强盛、而革命得竟全功、吾人所以擁護領袖者在此、而所以報效國家者亦在此、此尤爲吾國民於今日獻機慶祝之餘、所當身體而力行者也、（三十日電）</p>

<h3>蔣介石先生的家庭教育與學術修養</h3>
<p>— 邵元冲</p>
<p>爲介石先生五秩誔辰作</p>
<p>歷史家　對於時代中心人物的觀察，不但要明瞭其事業之所以偉大，還須要能認識其平時思想與學問上之修養，不但要深切注意共箇性之特點，更須深知其造成此種特性之家庭環境與家庭敎育。根據以上兩種條件，現在來對一般尊崇介石先生的同志同胞，將介石先生的家庭敎育與學術修養方面，就我所知的來作一個忠實的叙述。</p>
<p>民國紀元前　二十五年（舊曆丁亥——陽曆一八八七）介石先生誕生於浙江奉化錦溪的溪口鎭。這一年就是總理從廣州轉學到香港雅麗醫院附設之醫學校，與同學陳少白陸皓東諸先生昌言革命的時候。</p>
<p>介石先生　的先代，務農的居多，到其祖父玉表公改營商業，特別經營鹽業茶業，家中生計就漸漸充裕起來。玉表公又是一位樂善好施的長者，凡是親戚朋友有婚喪或緩急之事請他帮助的，都能够予以接濟。對於地方的公益，如修路補堤等事，統統盡力贊助，而几親身督理，力求完善。其所居附近錦溪的地方，爲寗波紹與台州三府之連界，有一條嶺名爲武嶺，爲三府人民往來必經之通路，因爲地　荒僻，人烟稀少，並無茶館飲食之處，玉表公乃在嶺上佛院，預備乾糧茶水，供給行人，許多年沒有問斷，行人非常感激。，玉表公又通醫理，常常爲人診治。也喜歡硏究佛學，因此發揮其仁慈博愛的精神。以濟人度世。治家雖嚴。而對人則親厚。介石先生幼年多病，玉表公常常自己替他診治極爲愛惜，因此介石先生幼年對玉表公之印象很深，而玉表公對於治家嚴待人厚爲社會盡力的美德，影響於介石先生後來的修養者不少。</p>
<p>介石先生的父親　肅庵公性情　直，處事公正，待人誠摯，自持勤儉，容貌毅重，較玉表公約性格更富於陽剛一方面。當玉表公時因經營鹽業，家計頗裕，而肅庵公十餘歲時，正値滿淸道光咸豐之時，太平天國軍興，浙江常爲太平軍與淸軍共爭之地，因此地方殘破，百業皆廢，玉表公畢生經營之鹽業亦被破壞，後來浙江軍事稍定，肅庵公繼承父志重振鹽業，發揮其幹練的能力，不到數年，就完全恢復。在鄕間好排難解紛，主持公道，對於公益事業極爲努力，地方敎育亦盡力興辦，凡無資求學者多予以濟助，因此造就的極多。其對家庭敎育方面，嘗對介石先生兄弟曰：「我因少年時繼承了先人的遺業，不能爲國盡力，但我還仍願對於地方上的公益和敎育，及改良風俗方面，盡相當努力，使地方安寧，親族和睦，你們可以專心讀書，將來如果有所成就，也可以彌補我的缺憾一。這番誠懇的家訓，給介石先生兄弟很大的感動。肅庵公到晚年時雖然愛子很切，但仍敎督很嚴，期望也逾深，因此介石先生後來對求學與國事方面的努力，實在與肅庵公約家敎有重大關係。肅庵公旣有這許多的美德與特性予介石先生精神上重大之陶冶，不幸因畢生勞瘁以致不克久享大年，五十三歲卽逝世，那時介石先生方九歲，其悲痛可知了。</p>
<p>介石先生　少年時，不但深受祖與父的家敎，卽受其母王太夫人的敎訓影響也很大。因介石先生髫年喪父，故王太夫人以一身　兼父母之責，訓子不倦，有述犯時，並痛加責懲，不稍姑息。介石先生十三歲出外求學時，王太夫人垂淚訓之曰：「自汝父之歿，吾辛辛苦苦使汝讀書者，非欲汝攫顯宦擁厚資也，所望爲國自愛，保先入之令名足矣，」此等訓辭，平時亦常常吿誡，故介石先生甚受感動。介石先生十八歲時赴日本習陸軍，太夫人深爲嘉許，並爲籌集旅資學費，使得成行，且在家中生活更加節儉，使學費不致缺乏。辛亥秋武昌革命軍起，江浙一帶亦繼續響應，其時介石先生在滬杭一帶督師，其家鄉親友聞知消息，多異常驚懼，但太夫人毫不惶恐，並說「男兒報國，死則死耳，何足爲慮。」以後江浙光復，捷報到家，太夫人亦處之如素，且於家書中，仍以爲國盡力，始終不懈等語時加警惕。介石先生在上海之時，雖屢决迎養，太夫人輒小住數日，仍返鄉中，安度其淡泊之生活，二决革命失敗，介石先生亡命海外，嘗以公和之急，馳書白母，太夫人皆力籌濟之，雖有危辭勸北之者皆不聽，其勇决慈仁之精神，入皆敬服。總理於民國五年，曾題贈「敎子有方」橫額以褒美之，而對地方公益與敎育之盡力，及對鄕里親族之周濟，皆承肅庵公之志繼續不懈。又好研究佛典，對於楞嚴維摩金測諸經，多能通其要義，這也於修養上有重大的影響。</p>
<p>介石先生　旣自幼至壯，歷承其祖父與父母嚴正的家庭訓育，故對身心修養上已有了剛健篤實的基礎，而急公好義的遺傳性，又爲其後來努力國事的先天萌芽，凡其特性中剛强的箇性，熱烈的情緒，勇决的精神，簡潔的生活，無不與其庭訓有關，由此可見家庭敎育對於箇性陶冶關係之密切了。</p>
<p>關於介石　先生革命情緒之養成，據其從前吿我，係因其先世自明亡遷浙以後，滿淸統治中國，蔣氏祖先曾有遺訓誥誡子孫，不作滿淸官吏，因此成爲家庭敎育中重要之訓條。後來介石先生到日本留學以後，因得受總理之指導，加入同盟會，對於革命大義，認識更加深切，其後又與陳英士先生等結交，因此其革命的情緒，更爲熱烈。但共最初革命思想的萌芽，也可以說與家庭敎育有重大的關係。</p>
<p>以上所叙，對於介石先生的性情，及革命思想之養成，與其家庭敎育之關係，可以得到深刻的槪念。現在再來略叙介石先生的學術修養方面。</p>
<p>介石先生治　學的態度，是苦做實做的，他從不希望用簡單省力省時的方法，求得髙深的學問基礎，他應用了從前許多學者治學的方法，如看一部書必須從頭至尾的圈點，以至寫剳記，註眉批，將書中的要義用硃筆劃出或點明的種種方法，他在許多認爲基本應精讀的書上，都用這種方法細密的研讀。他在民國十一二年東江軍事的挫折上，最大的憾事，便是將幾本日記和幾部加批並經過圈點的書籍失去了。現在存在他奉化家中書室，和廣州黃埔軍官學校校長辦公室，以及他隨身的一部分書籍中，可以找到許多種書，是經過他圈點批註及用硃筆藍筆劃過注意符號的，這都是他治學努力的成績。</p>
<p>介石先生早年因爲要養成有恒的習慣，就每天寫日記，這二十幾年中可說是沒有間斷，雖然因事情繁忙不能寫得很詳細但是每日總寫幾行，或是寫幾句。其日記的內容除了記事與所讀之書以外，對於性情修養之考察也自己忠實記出，如性情有無躁急之處，對人有無過分嚴厲予人難堪之處，雜念是否時起等等，無不隨時記出。至對於在上海秘密時期之記載，則每用隱語代表，如民國四年冬在上海肇和兵艦發難之時，日記中以「學校開會」代表「肇和發動」以禮堂打鐘」代表「海軍開砲」因此這一部極有歷史價値之手寫日記，將來如果作可能的發表，其中許多事實和隱語恐怕還非請介石先生自己作註解不可。</p>
<p>介石先生　對於修養上的基本書籍，除了總理的全部遺敎以外，可說得力於王陽明與曾國藩的著作最大，介石先生對於這兩家的全集，不但從頭至尾有系統的閱讀批點，而且反覆閱讀溫習，可說是百讀不厭。陽明與湘鄉皆在艱難中創造事功，這給介石先生遇到困難挫折的時候精神上一種極大的鼓勵。而總理一生之艱難奮鬥，尤其是廣州蒙難的幾十天中，在事實上得到一種眞切的訓練，爲其一生得力最大之處，至介石先生數十年中所閱讀的書當然很多，然基本精讀之書，也不過三十多種，現將其前數年自己開列選讀各書之目錄列舉於下：</p>
<p>五經　四子書　孔子　家語　左傳　戰國策　六韜　孫子　吳子　莊子　韓非子　楚辭　史記　資治通鑑　淸史　西洋史　歐戰史　普法戰史　拿氏戰史　日俄戰史　巴爾克戰術　各種軍事學　戰時正義　亞洲地理　世界地理　古文辭類纂　諸葛亮岳武穆文天祥戚繼光各集　曾國藩全集　胡林翼全集　左宗棠集　駱秉章集　李鴻章集　中國哲學史　心理學　統計學　社會學　經濟學</p>
<p>照上列這三十　幾種書的內容分析起來，可以說包括中國倫埋思想，中國政治哲學，中國史與世界史，中國軍事學原理與世界軍事學，中國文學，中外地理，以及一部分基本社會科學，若能融會貫通，也的確可以造成政治的基本學說了。這幾十種書旣是介石先生學術修養的基礎，希望大家要細細的體會。</p>
<p>以上所叙，不過介石先生學術修養與家庭敎育的片段，但由此可以證明，凡是一般要效法介石先生的，應該從他實際生活上，實際努力上，從平實處，刻苦處，細微處來下功夫。而一般父兄欲　培養子弟成材，也應該效法介石先生尊人的家敎慈愛而不姑息，立身行事處處給子弟一個做人的榜樣。這樣就是子弟將來不一定有非常的成就，至少也可以成為受規矩能自立的人，不至遺累於社會。一個國家的生存發展與進步，固然需要少數弘濟艱難的領袖，來負荷艱鉅，也需要多數急公守法博施濟衆自立自給的良民，來保持社會的安定，這是在本文結束中一層附帶的希望，望讀者注意。</p>

<h3>集中國力擁護領袖以求民族之生存</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>—在上海市國民軍訓會聚餐慶祝蔣委員長五　十壽辰席上演講詞—</p>
<p>今天我們上海市担任國民軍事敎育和公民訓練職務的全體同志，在此舉行聚餐大會，慶祝蔣委員長五十壽辰；我們對於這一個盛大慶祝會的意義，應當有一個深切的認識。</p>
<p>各位同志，要知道，中國今日所最需要的，是什麽？中國今日所最需要的，就是要有：</p>
<p>一個賢明的領袖；</p>
<p>一個有主義的黨；</p>
<p>一個强有力的政府</p>
<p>我們如果有了一個賢明的領袖，一個有主義的黨，和一個强有力的政府；不要說當前嚴重的國難，可以解除；就是比今日再嚴重十倍，我們也可以有力量來把他克服！</p>
<p>在過去，我們一般國民，對於挽救國難的條件，沒有認識淸楚；因此大家不能集中所有的力量來貢獻給領袖；而我們的領袖，也無從利用全國的力量來克服當前的環境，來解除當前的國難。假使在十年前，我們的民衆，能有這樣的覺悟，知道擁護領袖，擁護黨，擁誕政府，我敢信，决不會發生今日的國難；卽使發生，也早已把它克服了，解除了！</p>
<p>但是，現在的國民，已經覺悟了：已經深刻的認識到國家危機的嚴重；已經深刻的認淸楚挽救國難的途徑；已經準備着犧牲一切，拿所有的力量，心悅誠服的來貢獻給我們的領袖，來爲我們的領袖所用：使我們的領袖，能够拿這種磅礴偉大的力量，來挽救當前的危亡，來復興我們的民族。這不是過於樂觀的空想，而已有實際事實在表現。祇要看最近全國各地，我們民衆對於今年蔣委員長五十壽辰的認識，就可以證明。一向不問國事的民衆，現在已異常的興奮；無論男女老幼，幾乎個個都知道蔣委員長的五十壽辰；都知道對蔣委員長表示敬意；都相信蔣委員長是一個堅苦卓絕的領袖；是民族國家的救星。這一種全國一致，熱烈擁戴的國民的精神，在前幾天本市舉行中正隊命名典禮的時候，表現得更爲澈底。那一天，我們在龍華飛機塲有十幾萬民衆。爲什麽那天會有十幾萬人，來參加命名典禮呢？難道他們是來看熱鬧的嗎？不是，他們是來參加中正隊飛機命名典禮的，因爲這中正隊命名典禮的意義是非常重大，是充實國力，鞏固國防的一個莊嚴的典禮。從那一天國民精神的表現，我們可以說，中國入民，現在已有認識，已有覺悟，已曉得擁護頒袖，擁護黨，擁護政府；已認淸這三個條件，非具備不可；有了這三個條件，才能復興國家。而在這三個條件中，最重要的還是人。古語云：「得人則治」。所以，我們一定要有一個賢明的領袖，才可以建立强固的黨和政府。現在國難雖甚嚴重；但是，我們很樂觀，我們已有了一個堅苦卓絕，領導民衆的賢明的領袖；我們全國四萬萬五千萬民衆，也能一致的表示擁戴的熱誠；心悅誠服的願以一切力量集中起來，貢獻給領袖，使我們的領袖，能利用這種强大的力量來應付，來克服當前的國難！</p>
<p>各位　都是担任軍事敎育職務的，軍事敎育是民衆敎育最重要的部份。上海市民衆今日能有這樣的覺悟，能够對領袖，黨，和政府，有這種認識，不能不歸功於各位工作的努力。所以對於各位過去的勞績，今天本人應該表示敬意。不過今後的工作，更爲艱鉅。我們今日是要從死裏去求生。要四萬萬五千萬同胞，都能集中力量，擁護領袖，爲國犧牲，國家才有生路，民族才能復興，這就不能不希望各位今後加倍的努力！最後我們髙呼着：</p>
<p>蔣委員長萬歲！</p>
<p>中國國民黨萬歲！</p>
<p>中華民國萬歲！</p>
<h3>蔣公介石五秩壽誕</h3>
<p>— 兪飛鵬</p>
<p>中華民國　二十五年十月三十一日，爲軍事委員會委員長兼行政院長蔣公介石五秩壽辰，中央黨部國際宣傳處擬刋行祝壽專集，徴文於鵬，竊以蔣公再造民國，統一華夏，其平生勳業事蹟，殆爲國人共聞共見，並能共道，無待鵬之稱述其萬一。</p>
<p>惟鵬之於公，少同里閈，長隸帡幪，追隨戎馬之間者，垂二十年，親炙日久，深知公之所以逈異恒流者，不僅在才略之卓越，而在人格之偉大，其所以能養成此偉大之入格，蓋完全得力於忠孝二字也。</p>
<p>公天資英邁，沈毅絕倫，蚤歲富於民族革命思想，淸季加入同盟會後，始而從陳公英士起義滬江，卓著戰績，繼則追隨總理孫公，一方致力軍事建設，樹立革命基礎，一方策畫出征軍事，剪除南北軍閥，殫智竭慮，置成敗利鈍生死於度外，以翊贊總理，扶植主義，鞏固黨國，如公之忠，雖古昔民族英哲不是過耳。</p>
<p>公髫失怙，王太夫人辛苦艱難，以育以敎，旣遣其求書異國，復許其委身革命，而公至性過人，能先意承志，以事太夫人，太夫人之所示，未嘗有違，太夫人之所禁，未嘗擅行，門庭之內，融融洩洩，數十年如一日，鄕里僉知稱羨，先哲有言，求忠臣必於孝子之門，然則公之所以能效忠於國，而盡救國之責任者，抑又孝行之所擴充也。</p>
<p>人心之陷溺，風俗之敗壞，至今日而極矣，公本其素性夙行，思以忠孝之道挽救人心世俗，而培養國脈，是誠對症下藥，非尋常政治家所可企及，吾人所馨香禱祝以求者，公此種偉大之救國方略，普施天下，而完全成功，因救國者以壽國，則公之偉大人格，亦當與國同壽矣，鵬之所欲言者如此，交通部政務决長代理部務俞飛鵬</p>

<h3>如何應付當前之糧食問題</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>本年自豆麥米穀出新以來市價有增無减遂引起各方面之注意說者以爲漲因所在由於銀行投資農村承辦糧食抵押放欵及各省農倉事業發達而致儲藏甚多再則由於農民多爲豐收囤積餘糧待價而沽或慮天旱成災紛圖儲備因之而糧價飛漲誠如所說是亦可喜之現象也蓋豐收而果爲事實積聚餘糧以防凶歲事無有善於此者何况爲積儲而漲漲至有害於當前之民食時勢必停止積儲或竟出其所儲之糧而耀之以平準糧價此不但無妨於民食且有調節之益則糧價一時之食固不足慮若積儲之目的爲別有所在或蓄以居奇或資爲操縱心存奢望意在牟利則糧價愈貴愈堅其囤積之心縱市吿糧荒人艱粒食亦豈能動若輩之意使騰貴之原因在此則誠屬可慮而不得不另求有效之處置矣至農民因豐收有餘而思待價以沽及秋旱日甚而思積穀防飢依照目前一般農民之經濟能力當爲絕對少數卽有圃積數亦甚微似不足成爲糧價上漲之主因也</p>
<p>當八省市糧食會議開會之際曾由滬市代表提議籌設糧食運銷局調節民食平準糧價及經設處籌備終以欵鉅事大移歸財部籌辦最近政府方面又有成立一糧食主管機關及禁止食糧出口等問題有卽日召集有關各部會會議之說而江蘇浙江兩省亦以近來糧價日漲半由糧商私運所致有嚴禁食糧出口之舉上海雜糧業以此事障碍流通有妨滬地民食正在呼籲解禁凡此皆糧價上漲聲中所直接引起之影響也</p>
<p>夫欲談解决民食問題其道多矣豈此短評所能盡簡要言之今日糧價之上漲有如「銅山東崩洛鐘西應」產銷各地之糧價此漲彼應固非一地漲而一地賤而有賴於運銷之調劑故運銷雖爲解决民食問題之要著尙非目前之急務旣一方面談運銷則重在流通而一方面乃限制出境此又何說乎要知今日問題之癥結似不在於禁止出口蓋年來米糧北運不絕吾人早以爲可慮所謂「用兵之利在乎「取用於民因糧於敵」方無「遠輸貧師」之患」（見三月十一日本報時評）故禁止卽使見諸實行而彼方目的所在能否必其不襲走私之故技且我國門戶洞開甌脫猶存更能必其到達起岸之後不轉運之他乎卽使無此顧慮毅然實施亦須全國皆禁止出口並陸路亦有防範而其效始著蓋不如是則夾帶出境仍無可防制若實施檢騐過境米糧則又慮苛擾病商矣至各省間之流通加以限制不但啟留難之漸設羣起傚允又將失調節之利何况壤土相接形如犬牙一水之隔分屬兩省此疆彼界之間如胡越之相視雖未出於遏糴之一途而其不便已足爲糧食流通之障礙矣</p>
<p>爲今之計除糧食之運銷積儲容當別論外竊謂宜注意下列數端（一）現在保甲之制推行甚力食糧生產調査不難計日竣事一方面就糧食之集散口岸調査到銷之數則糧食產銷自得較確實之數字可用爲調節之張本（二）糧食市塲如何减少外來勢力之支配並如何加以實際上之管理而杜投機分子之操縱此當卽籌實施者（三）應辦理公開囤積庶於獎勵積儲之下防止商人之居奇（四）設糧食管理機關於糧食集散口岸此項機關不可由各方面雜凑而成必須有專事負責之人員官商合作辦理糧食各事宜（五）在目前如認爲糧價已高應稍加節制則請銀行界暫弗作投資農村收儲糧產之種種宣傳以堅投機分子及國戶之心理並暫行停買以緩和市塲之緊張至食糧究竟豐收至如何程度有無餘剩抑仍不足要吾另籌整個之計畫旣不可顧慮太深亦不宜看事太易應以公衆福利爲前提而從事實上謀解决也。</p>

<h3>西政府軍反攻　瑪德里轉危爲安　用坦克車飛機作戰　京南三重鎮告克復</h3>
<p>瑪德里　據政府宣稱、政府軍在瑪德里陣綫之南區與東南區大舉反攻後、獲有重要之勝利、政府軍已克復陀維拉斯科·拉加爾柴達·及西西那三鎭、國民革命軍本準備由該三鎭向首都作最後之進攻、此外政府軍復完全控制瑪德里與阿朗育茲間之鐵路錢、頃正向距首都二十五哩之伊里斯加城方面前進、據陸軍部發表公報、宣布此役詳情、謂政府軍反攻後、在南面陣綫獲得極大之進步、結果國民革命軍已在他方陣綫調步兵砲隊與摩洛哥騎兵增援云、在過去三日之中、政府飛機曾在北面西北與西南陣綫擊落國民革命軍飛機三十架、瑪德里方面雖未公布確訊、但城內之空氣似已漸趨寧靜、西總理加巴萊洛已發表一驚人官言、謂民團現因已備有坦克車及充分之軍火、故能安然前進、而在二十四小時內使首都脫離危險、據稱、叛軍因民團猝然以坦克車飛機與鐵甲火車奮勇進攻、不及抵禦、遂被迫退却、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　京城本日第一次獲得政府軍勝利之捷報、居民咸大爲興奮、且今晨加巴萊洛總理發表告民衆書、表示政府抗戰决心、允獲得良好印象、政界人士則以本日政府軍之勝利、比之於歐戰時瑪恩河之役、（按一九一五年德軍進迫巴黎時、法國霞飛統帥率部抗戰、敗德軍於瑪恩河、轉危爲安、是爲歐戰中之一著名戰役、）本日此間復有裝甲火車一列、馳往格里農小村、此外政府軍日前已秘密凖備裝甲火車數列、卽數日來猛攻通至西烏達勒阿爾及阿朗育茲之鐵路綫時所用者、政府軍不僅在中路前錢採取攻勢、聞在其他各處前綫亦將改取攻勢、京城居民關心內戰形勢發展、現達最高點、城內各街道時見傷兵行走、其中大多數係足部爲機關槍彈及手溜彈所擊傷、今晨京城並有政府軍飛機數架在天空散擲宣言、勸吿京城居民投効官軍、以參加防衛京城之大戰云、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西政府表示　抗戰決心　發表告民衆書</h3>

<h3>對西班牙內亂　英維持中立　防杜戰禍延及全歐　艾登演說袒葡抑俄</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院辯論因西班牙內戰發　生國際現局之際、外相艾登切實聲明英政府仍固守不干涉西班牙事務政策、否則大局必將混亂、而起國際之相互詬責、或不免促或戰爭、艾氏謂此種政策、已獲英國人民大衆之贊助、英國人民深以西班牙兩黨自相水火、任意殺戮爲憾、但相信彼等政府之主要職責、乃在防杜戰禍由發生之不幸國家境內蔓延於他國、</p>
<p>今日下院開會時、議員席與旁聽席皆吿人滿、許多外國之大使與正使亦列席其間、首相包爾溫今爲病後第一次出臨下院、面容微現灰白、但發言結束辯論時、精神尙佳、</p>
<p>艾登於演說之始、詳述不干涉協定成立前之種種事獰、分析該協定所及於互爭雙方之效果、並答覆關於該恊定實施之指摘、艾登否認法政府在英政府壓迫下發起該恊定之謠言、謂法政府自己發起此舉、英政府之意、此舉實大有助於歐洲之和平、今其有人否認不干涉政策爲最足維持歐洲和平之政策乎、下院所須討論者厥唯此點、渠知一般民衆有指該協定之實施、志在抵制西班牙政府者、甚至有人謂該協定已决定西班牙內戰進行之途徑、艾登於是乃詳加指駁、以證明諸說之謬誤、謂倡此諸說者之意中、以爲苟無此項協定、則西班牙政府可獲外國充量軍火之接濟、而可消除其原有之不利各點、再、在該協定成立之前、各處毫無爭辯、但國民軍則獲不止一方面之大批軍火接濟、每方面所得軍火接濟之總源、爲意德法俄英五國、俄意德三國製造大批武器歷時巳久、不難以軍火協助彼等所贊助之一方而異常迅速、但意國在地理上所處之地位極佳、故其供給軍火也較俄爲便、至於英國因其　防程序之需要、故縱無　干涉協定、其軍火所能接濟西班牙者於戰事之勝負並無重要關係、渠不能爲法國發言、惟處目前歐洲大局緊張之際、而請法國供給大批軍火、其困難不煩想像而可知、故渠願請諸議員有以爲不干涉恊定之實施完全不利於西班牙政府者、重行考慮此事、而沉味渠頃間所發之辯論、外相繼述及該協定之實施與國際委員會事、謂英政府曾盡其力之所能、使委員會發生效果、而趕速進行一切討論、英代表在昨日該委員會會議中、猶提出監視西班牙海陸入口各點之建議、外相於是乃抨擊蘇俄對葡萄牙之熊度、謂英政府未嘗須臾贊助蘇俄監視葡國海港之建議、今就公道言、英政府所接各種情報未有證明葡國首違反不干涉協定者、</p>
<p>外相至是吿知下院、謂英政府今後仍將與法政府密切接觸、希望共同决定一切、因此兩民治政府皆負有重要職責也、艾登繼乃嘉讚英國海軍、英海軍共由西班牙載出難民六千人、其中英人佔二千之數、許多外國政府已來文申謝云、</p>
<p>外相演說畢、工黨議員格林武氏。自由黨領袖辛克萊氏。均要求明悉巴里利克羣島之眞相、因外傳意軍現已控制諸島故也、格林武氏謂直布羅陀現以笑顏對西班牙法西斯煎、而以怒顏對矢忠西班牙政府老、辛克萊氏謂西班牙法西斯黨非得意國之輔助、不能成功、此必預先商妥者、辛氏發言主張維持不干涉協定、謂法國或英國以砲一尊供給西班牙、而意國與德國則能供給五十尊之多、故今仍宜維持不干涉恊定、</p>
<p>首相包爾溫發言結束辯論、謂雙方咸小免有違反不干涉協定之處、但其重要尙不足使英國修改具政策、自八月杪起、英國繼續推　其在西班牙人道的努力、英政府曾　西班牙政府交換人質而經拒絕、故後來向蒲爾哥斯當局提出此議、惟英政府曾單獨進行一切、頗獲效果、駐瑪德里之英代辦曾會同外交團私請西政府遏止私人仇殺、並置可靠衛隊於各監獄、現時西班牙當局已給予保證、對於一切屠殺情形、將悉行停止、各方籲請之美滿結果、立時可見、</p>
<p>包氏繼言、就英國方面而論、共產與法西斯兩種勢力、皆無從施其技倆、此則應感謝上帝者也、渠意以爲民治與專制兩種政體之區別、卽在前者將其所有之煩擾情事公布於世、而在專制之下、吾人對於其紛擾之何在、必須加以推測、包氏復稱、「英國政治之制度比較健全、雖有紐飛爾特爵士與航空部發生意見之事、但亦範圍甚小、外間所傳、皆係宣傳過甚、並非眞相、包氏對於共產及法西斯兩種主義、皆抨繫不遺餘力、繼述及有人以爲德國他日或將攻擊英國一節、謂英國之危險並不在於德國、渠以爲戰爭之慘禍、並無不可避免之理由、</p>
<p>包氏之結語曰、「吾人目下所努力進行者、厥爲世界之和平是也」、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英國會　昨日開幕　宣讀佢諭旨　述及外交內政</h3>
<p>（倫敦）日昨國會複會之後、兩院議員頃於本日晨間集合於上議院、舉行開幕典禮、司法大臣海爾珊子爵適在假斯中、當由兩院聯席委員會主席翁斯洛勛爵代爲官讀國王愛德華八世詔書、國王御駕幷未親臨、反對派各黨領袖亦未出席、國王詔書有云、「朕與各國始終保持友好關係」、幷述及英國政府前於八月二十六日與埃及所成立之同盟條約、略謂、「英埃兩國睦誼素篤、合作無間、今茲訂立同盟條約、一俟國會核准之後、則兩國關係卽將開一新紀元、而原來合作精神、亦當發揚而光大之、此朕所厚望者也」、决述及七月間蒙德婁會議克底於成、無任慶幸、至</p>

<h3>上海　工部局小學概況（一）　本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</h3>
<p>上海公共租界工部局在界內設立華童小學日校六所，夜校二所；共有學生四千八百八十六人，本文對於工部局立華童小學日校及夜校各項設施將作簡要介紹。至於工部局立西童公學及華童中學各項設施以不屬本文範圍，暫行從略。筆者承工部局華人教育處處長陳鶴琴先生多方指導，並蒙各華童小學日校校長及夜校主任多方供給材料，均此誌謝！</p>
<p>一，辦學經過</p>
<p>上海公共租界工部局設立華童小學，始於民國十七年十月八日。原來工部局曾在租界內設立華童中學四所；惟華童小學則尚未開辦。華董虞洽卿諸位先生鑒於租界內幼年學齡兒童的衆多，乃於最初參加公共租界董事會議時，卽行提出租界內應多設華童小學，並由華人主辦管理。此案經過工部局董事會詳細討論之後，乃通過由華人先行試辦華童小學兩所；並聘請兒童教育專家陳鶴岑先生擔任工部局華人教育處處長，主持租界內華人教育事宜。</p>
<p>民國十七年十月八日工部局芷式開辦東區北區華童小學各一所：東區小學位於匯山路一百五十號；北區小學位於靶干路二百二十八號。兩校校舍均係租賃西式住宅。最初兩校入學兒童合計僅有一百六十五人。十九年九月靶千路北區小學遷入克能海路華童公學校舍內開學。（因為華童公學巳另有較大之校舍）自此以後，北區小學乃有正式校舍。同年九月，工部局早在西區愛文義路九一四號租賃民房，開辦西區小學一所。這時，華童小學已增至三所：學生人數亦增至一千一百四十七人。</p>
<p>二，八年教育　計劃</p>
<p>爲計劉及改進租界內教育設施起見，工部局特於十九年六月十八日設立一學務委員會。該會委員共有九人，華人委員先後參加者計有劉湛恩，歐元懷，袁履登，林康侯，陳蔗靑，奚玉書諸位先生。該委員會會於一十年建議工部局，實施八年教育計劃。此項教育計劃經工部局董事會正式通過，惟保留至二十三年年底有再行複議之權。八年教育計劃中關係華人教育之擴充及改進方面者有：（一）目二十年起至二十七年止，每年添建男女兼收之華童小學兩所，每所可容學生六百名。（二）二十年年內應增設華人女子中學一所；二十三年年底以前，另行增設華人女子中學一所。（三）現有之華童公學四所應逐漸改為較為確定之中學，與中國政府所頒佈之中學制度相符。（四）華童中學之校長，行政人員，及教員等，均宜於可能之時，聘用勝任之華人充任。（五）租界內之私立華人中小學，辦理成績優良者，得請求工部局補助經費。</p>
<p>根據上項教育計劃，工部局曾於二十年九月九日租賃麥特赫司脫路二百三十三號民房開辦華人女子中學一所。又於二十一年四月租賃華德路招商局公學原有校舍開辦華德路華童小學一所。又於二十一年九月在新閘路完成華童小學新校舍一所；原在愛文義路上學之西區小學學生乃正式遷入新校舍上課。又於二十二年二月在荊州路完成新校舍一所；同年三月一日正式招生開學。此時匯山路東區小學校舍亦經工部局買進，改為東區女子小學校舍；將新開之荊州路小學改為東區男子小學。華德路小學則為東區男女生兼收之小學。關於第三。第四第五。一二項建議，工部局也曾在相當範圍內努力實行，現不贅述。那時，全世界處於不景氣狀態，上海公共租界也受深刻的影響。工部局各項捐稅收入銳减；所以在二十三年年底工部局董事會對於學務委員會所建議之八年教育計割複議暫綏進行，因此每年添建華童小學兩所之計劃未能全部實現。</p>
<p>二十四年十月，工部局在局立莉州路小學校舍內聞辦荊州路夜校一所，收錄在工廠作工而未完畢初小程度之男子職工。本年二月，又在工部局匯山路東區女子小學校舍內開辦匯山路夜校一所，收錄在工廠作工而未完畢初小程度之女子職工。本年四月，又在　路西童公學原有校址添辦二部制華童小學一所。到目前止，工部局已在租界內開辦華童小學日校六所，夜校二所；現在將八所與校的校名，地址和設立年月調查抄錄於後：</p>

<h3>美棉新買賣大見减少</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况另滯、各月由跌二磅音至漲一磅音、同業及外商買進、惟套賣仍有增無减、新買賣大减、同業大半觀望、現需較靜、脚地尚堅、布市堅而呆、收盤時一部份補空、頗形穩定、計現貨跌一磅音、期貨跌一至五磅音、英棉現貨跌七點、期貨跌一至四點、印棉初因多頭了結而疲、旋因一部份空戶抵補及同業買進而堅、終因經紀商賣出再軟、計平果爾跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·五至一羅比、白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（二十九日電）</p>

<h3>疋頭　到期日廠細布　號家頗有跌價出籠</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、因標紗花交割、市勢平靜、且月底已到、各號家所訂日廠本月份貨細布、最占多數、照日廠向例、卽使無現貨、亦須悉數墊出、故心思看低者暗中跌價、出籠者殊不乏人、市盤混亂、但廠方並無廉意、故多數執貨者、均準備墊銀、以觀下月市面、且月內餘額、為數已屬無多、客帮本街均乏進意、惟　催定貨、現各布廠　多、　交、惟以週前受紗綫斷擋影響、出數大减、以致誤期、貨額殊巨、本廠粗布因週前升漲過速、達二·三元之巨、目下雖逐步回跌、仍難站定、昨各廠重磅粗布仍有跌價一·二角之譜、色貨之斜藍布直貢嗶嘰縐呢印花貨市勢均軟、售盤尚未更動、獨白絨布雙面絨彩條絨市銷續盛、現貨缺乏、最為挺秀云、</p>
<h3>西貨啥咪呢更受歡迎</h3>
<p>啥咪呢邇來市銷暢旺、本街內地帮之裁縫店、俱有需辦、因門莊定製之西服顧客、齊有指選故耳、惟現市所存者、大半均為下檔四五元一碼之國貨、其七八元一碼之元常灰素四貨啥咪則頗形軋缺、故近日掮客跑街、搜羅甚忙、為數雖不多、而空氣巳隨之轉緊、價卽由之上漲矣、昨正眞頭號啥咪呢、拆貨店分料每碼開售十二元、普通為八元七角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　麺粉稍受洋麥挫折</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後各月份均呈回跌之象、因洋麥報價、芝加哥跌二三角、坎拿大跌七角左右、利物浦跌一二便士、故開價時、人心大感不安，近遠期開價卽小二分左右、而天津交易所已有定期開拍之說、此後局面、當有爭競之可能、故盤以後、交易甚少、價微平疲、迨至下午開盤、交易較暢、市亦略升、囚業外心思、終以洋麥雖跌、定價尚未接近、故擯持甚力、照此種趨勢、或者所傳洋麥免稅後、使廠方有充裕之拋碼、人一心方易就範云，</p>
<h3>澳麥有出口可能　期麥逐難振作</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份一至說落、因洋麥報價、反跌甚猛、且傳澳麥之估計、實有輸出之可能、報價鬆動、常非無因、故開價時各月份較之前日、即跌三四分至七八分、惟市塲籌碼、因國麥落令、常感不暢、是以交易未見大暢、迫至下午開盤、交易仍清、惟以粉市跌度無幾、且出戶稀少、故喊價又復高升、較上午回好四五分、現麥市面、高貨未開、二檔貨價仍平定、開山東麥六元零五分、洋河麥六元零五分、决零一分、瑤灣麥六元零二分、蚌埠麥六元零三分、漢口麥五元八角、江北麥五元九角四分、淮安麥五元九角七分、崇明麥五元七角半、由福新辦一萬包、阜豐辦三千餘包云、</p>
<h3>河米跌價後客銷復動</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到四十四五號、貨共九千餘石、內仍以新薄稻居多、故薄稻市况、初因包胃轉懈、零銷呆滯、售方喊價頗低、跌風殊熾、惟經此一跌、客帮又見活動、結果計靑姻平津等帮辦去三千餘包、行情高料跌二角三五分、中關竟瀉下四五角之巨、厚新粳因亦降落角半、僅杜洋尖賴貨稀、尚稱堅穩、新陰元則步步下游、再貶二尺、厚薄破粳平庸、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源三十三四號、市上去路平淡、特新粳市價挺立、中决破粳新粳價略帶緊、羊埠客尖價加一角、杜尖跟緊六七分、菉種高貨包胃動辦、價尚和平、中决者零銷亦呆、價小一角左右、變元價短一角、陰元又小二角零、</p>
<h3>客秈豫省去路續暢</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、本有繼續飛騰之象、惟到頭仍旺、而粤帮去胃略懈、故市價未能再度在漲、然以產價高昂、貨主始終堅持、且粤帮雖未如前日之貪辦、但仍有揀高吸收、粤帮除辦去高糙三千包外、並有江西機早米二千多包之成交、河南帮亦續辦機早各米、祇嫌東輛不足、未克暢辦、至其後胃依然旺暢也、本街進胃仍活、故交易雖减、而行情仍見步砌三五分至近角、全日開江西米五千二百五十包、湘米一二千一百五十包、漢糙一千包、廠元五十包</p>

<p>二百磅會司鐵因到存俱稀、市况甚佳、而最近日本又向海外搜羅、以致來華之貨、益感稀少、行情陡見升漲、刻市如老鋼廠貨每箱沽三十六元、新鋼廠貨三十五元、野鶏貨沽三十四元五角、比前好起五角至一元不等、據同業消息、近來各國均在積極擴充軍備、會司鐵出品、遂大為减少、近期固已無貨、卽遠期亦須等至明年二三月份、方有期貨可定、故頂料申市到貨必稀、查交易昨市開出達六七百箱之多、購戶多為客帮及本街製罐廠、惟玩具及香烟等廠、則近來交易較為寂寞云、</p>

<h3>糖市　綿赤汕頭產轉鬆</h3>
<p>昨枘市趨勞平軟、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貸一十一元六角、無上幕、轉口貨六元一角半、比小五分、東白四八九號、均呌原價、成交寥寥、本廠綿白振記一號二十元半、一號二十元一角、三號十九元七角、四號十九元三角、五號十八元九角、號貨綿赤近以產價見鬆、號盤隨降、較之高價時前後的小五六角、海南赤趨勢較堅、無上落、雜路赤亦少開出、市象平疲、</p>
<p>合組公司昨為本週第三次標兌粤糖之期、計總定額為七千六百餘包、標價如前、成交仍少、當售出順德廠五羊組白三百十五包、二十一元半、市新廠又一百包、二十一元三角、汕頭高又一首包、二十一元三角、普通又一百包、二十一元一角、决莊及中砂白標原價均未售出、統共僅成六百十五包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　生晒肉來源仍稀</h3>
<p>昨到二十一件…今日可見樣</p>
<p>生晒桂圓肉、近以來源仍稀、市勢堅挺、查昨日嘉應輪入口如石碼同安等貨、統共僅到二十一件、因之人心頗佳、聞今日可以見樣開盤、大約同肉可望加漲一二元、碼肉因已達六十元、或須暫定、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲市活動　華絲外銷反成擯局</h3>
<p>廠商原料缺乏難以應市</p>
<p>昨日海外絲市、紐的交易所行盤、近遠兩期貨品、均開原價、橫濱上午徵升二元至七元左右、但至下午則回小十二元許、里昂絲市仍堅挺、上海絲AB兩等級一致漲二法郎、廣東絲漲·五〇法郎、申埠絲市因索價太高、內外絲銷均少售開、際此國外絲市活動時期、本為外銷良機、而觀邇來市情、則日趨擯局、殊屬不解、但一般廠商亦各有苦衷、據聞日前除建廳及永泰等較大資本之絲業機關外、原料缺乏、已成為普遍之現象、故十一月至十二月間、一部分絲廠雖不停工者、蓋今之絲價、欲低不能、高又難售、而外銷絲之有賬無絲、有貨無賬、猶為歷年常情、為整個絲業言、實為一最大缺憾、深望改良蠶絲號對此生絲營業機構上之缺點、亦加注意之、</p>
<h3>特載　非常時期的　民食問題</h3>
<p>天　我生</p>
<p>本來各省縣已在積極建設倉庫，但是平時的倉庫，為便管理起見，固宜各縣集中，而在非常時期，則宜散布各鄉，萬不可為孤注之一擲。現行保甲制度，已見成功，大可利用當地原有的社廟，來做倉庫，只要做上幾工木作泥水，馬上可以成立社倉。責成甲長先把當地居民，所需糧食，的略計算一下，假定一百戶，平均五口，則依古訓所謂一人二合米，一錢鹽，每日應需一右半米，十斤鑒，儲備半年之計，但有六百石殺，二十担鹽，卽可免於恐慌。如有一不足，則向外購入，宜早莫週，核其總値，至多不過二千元耳。假如由甲長組織五百元之合作社，每股五元，加四倍之保證責任，卽向銀行貸欽收買，凡有一担谷儲入社倉者，先付七成之價，其餘三成，則分六期分給，卽雇長工數名，絡繹馨碓成米出耀，由甲長專司其事，一而由銀行派人保管，所負責任，不過一一千元，人選自易，用人亦卽不患其多，社倉之虛實，不難一望而知，卽於信用上有確實之保證，並以民匽駐在其中，用資保律，吃大戶之危險，亦可免焉。卽在銀行方面，與其將鈔票捆識出境，母寗藏富於民，使得流通於鄉鎭之間，以增信用，蓋於收買之際，付出者　鈔票，而在耀出之際，收入者亦為鈔票。凡為甲長，莫不由戶長公舉而來，至少必有相當之信用及財產，故吾以為社倉制度，實至輕而易舉，防徽防蛀，亦易設施，比之集中屯積，或生叢弊，而臨危又感移民移粟之兩難者，不且事半而功倍之耶　至於付價七成，或疑農民有所難色，實則種戶收穫，無不自留其食，所急急於戀錢者，原不過十之七耳。目因急於變錢，每被殺價，忍痛劃棄，本出無奈，今以儲入社會，不管為自家雨雪之糧，比之屯稍家中，尤為穩妥，在保甲制度之下，卽不難於足食足兵，以取民信，吾甚願我實明政府，速起行之。蕉子有云，「天行有常，不為堯存，不為桀亡」，故吾以為無倫共為非常時期，與平常時期，吾民以食為天，吾人固當法天行事，盡其天職，庶不致如杞人之憂天焉。惟是大亂居鄉，卽鄕村戶口，勢必增多，故於食備之量，至少常較平時加十分之三耳。</p>

<h3>從女權運動說到女子自強問題</h3>
<p>— 守卓</p>
<p>女權運動的呼聲，似乎不是最近才發現的；然而女權運動的結果究竟有什麽成績，恐怕誰也不能肯定的答復吧！女權運動的目的，亁脆的說一句，就是求男女的平等，也可以說女子要股離以前非人的地位，而躋於人的地位，享人類應享的權利，盡人類應盡的義務。當然，這種目的要普遍的達到，而不是一部分的達到，否則局部的解决，暫時的解决，都不是根本的辦法。</p>
<p>雖然在目前的中國，機關商店都有了女區員的蹤跡，文增竇苑，時時有些婦女的作品，似乎可以說女權運動有了相當的效果。但是我們試一問社會上對於女職員的評價如何？再一問就菜的女子有多少？職業婦女所做的工作是什麽？我們會恍然大悟，而下一肯定的斷語道：婦女運動還期待着我們的自强努力呢。</p>
<p>現在的時代，是生存競爭的時代唯有適者才可生存。—取得生存的權利—唯有優者才可勝利。—打破惡劣的環境，—我們要求適，要求優，只有自强奮鬥，只有切實工作，喊幾聲口號，求人家憐惜，不過是自騙的手段罷了。至於强奮鬥的必要條件，至少應具備下列三點。</p>
<p>（一）有正確的思想—在一切準備之先，我們要矯正錯誤的觀念，建立正確的思想，要知道我們的要求，是確立平等</p>
<p>的基楚，決不是單求權利方面或者享樂方面的滿足。譬如我們固正要求女子參政權；但是我們絕對不應該誤認女子在家操作和撫養小孩是可鄙棄的工作。我們祇要求有平等的精神，在政治上教育上社會上沒有重男輕女的習慣存在，我們無論做官做教員做家庭工作都有同樣的重要性。至於有少政女子以為女權運動的目的，在使女子脫離了家庭的束縛，而儘量在家庭外面去自由享樂，所以即不願為家庭而操作，又不能為社會服務，祗學會了些時髦的口語，在社會上分利享樂，結果徒然加重了社會對女了輕視的程度，這都是思想錯誤的結果。</p>
<p>（二）有强健的體魄—我們知道做每一件事情都要有健全的體魄，女子要負起社會國家的一半責任，當然先要有健全的體格。但是我們中國女子素來以多愁善病出名的，體格的不健全眞是無可諱言，所以社會上一般的論調，總說女子工作的効率遠不及男子。女子果眞是這樣嗎？我們不看見蘇俄的女子，參加軍事工作，同男子負一樣的責任，我們中國農村裏的婦女，也有許多地方和男子同樣地在田問操作，難道不是一個强有力的反證嗎？所以我們只要積極的訓練，也不難有健全的體魄，來負起重大的責任。現在我們急須喚起大衆的注意，用最大的努力，來鍜練强健的體魄。</p>
<p>（三）有專長的技能—有—有了正確的思想，健全的體魄，還要有專長的技能，然後可以任重致遠。所謂專長的技能，決不是略知一些皮毛，是要對某一種事業或者某一件工作，有深刻的研究，長期的訓練，一旦担任了這一種任務以援，非但能够應付裕如，並且要把個人的才能，儘量發揮，求得良好的成績。關於這一點，我們要求辦理婦女教育的人們注意專業的訓練，同時希望正在求學的女子，决定一個方針，全神貫注以求專長技能的養成。當然專業訓練要適應環境的需要，迎合各個人的志趨能力，决不是呌大家削足就履，走同一的道途。</p>
<h3>美國的職業婦女</h3>
<p>— 魯沙白</p>
<p>—各國婦女職菜現狀的對話—</p>
<p>A：近來我常聽見人說婦女要求解放，先要得着職業的平等，這要求當然是根據經濟獨立的原則而起，但或許也是看見先進國家婦女職業的發達而才提出這「口號」。我現在想，知道點各國職業婦女的狀况，希望你先講點美國職業婦女的現狀給我聽。</p>
<p>B：好的，好的，我們可以坐下來談，請你隨意問吧</p>
<p>A　：我想知道點美國職業婦女在社會上的地位。</p>
<p>B：她們在社會上的地位在世界上算是最高等的，不過她們的自覺却不及英國的職業婦女，但在社會地位上是比較其他各國高出好多倍</p>
<p>A　：她們一個日拿多少薪水呢？</p>
<p>B：她們就職的範圍很廣……，上自報館的編輯主任，公司的社長，下至打字員，百貨店的女店員，她們都過着很優裕的生活，不過不能一概而論，常然自己有資本經營事業的婦女除外，平均每年以收入五千美金的人最多。美國職業婦女工資最低的、，是百貨店的女店員和沒有什麼特長的事務員，現在不景氣的時候工資隨之低落，一週至多拿到十二美金上下（合國幣三十六元。）女傭工資更低。在景氣的時候黑人每月可賺到七百美金，但自從發生經濟恐慌後，也就今非昔比了，她們只要有棲身和噉飯之地，就可以為人效勞，也顧不到工錢的多少了！不過當廚子有手腕的黑人，薪金仍然很高……。白人女傭，相當好的每月可得三十五美金。一般職業婦女充當速訊兼打字的很多，一週間可得二十五到二十八美金，女秘書每月可拿到六十至一百定金。</p>
<p>A：現在我想起了再來問問關於婦女職業的部門？</p>
<p>B：她們就職的人數和男子濿不多，每一個職業部鬥裏長都有她們參加，並且都佔相當重要的地位。她們在政治上也有做縣長，市長，和公使等要職的。她們還參加各種調杳研究的工作，像科事研究室，機械工程建築設計等工作上，都有她們的活動，這是我們中國婦女所罕見的。這種婦女因為是用頭腦的高級技術工作，所以她們所得的報酬也較多。</p>
<p>A：美國對於職　婦女的社會設施完備不完備呢？</p>
<p>B：美國的社會設施是相當發達的。</p>
<p>A：美國也有託兒所等設施嗎？</p>
<p>B：專為職業婦女而設立的是沒有，不　　　　　，是和託見所一　的性實。</p>
<p>A：職　婦欠有病的時侯，國家是不是有療養院回種設俌呢？</p>
<p>B：雖然國家沒有　備，但是各區在社會事業的名義下，也設有公共的病院，醫樂費只收半價。</p>
<p>A：她們對於政治是否關心呢？幾歲才有選舉權呢？在選舉的時候有沒有棄權的事情呢？</p>
<p>B：她們對於政治是比較關心的，一般的女子，到二十一歲便有選舉權，工廠的女工大都有組織，所以對於政治的意識比較明顯，棄權的事是很少的。普通的婦女有一部分比較注意政治，但大部份也取不聞不問的熊度，甚至於有些有選舉權的都自行放棄。</p>
<h3>女職員的本分</h3>
<p>— 成培珍</p>
<p>我們婦女界在社會上服務，除具有相當的學識和經騐外，更須有儉樸的精神，謙和的熊度，誠實的品行，則我各界的女職員，將來的發展，未可限量也，如果一有了位置，就抱着一種驕傲的熊度，奢侈的慾望，浪漫的心性，塗脂抹粉，秀髮蓬鬆，專事修飾，而不以本身職務上的本分為前提，那末非但不合女職員的身分，而且還有一個花瓶的雅號，實在是自降人格的舉動啊！像這樣喜歡濫出風頭的女職員，為任何機關或商店所大忌，對於本身的前程，大有不利之處，且每月所得的薪水有限，以辛苦換來的汗血金錢，何必定要揮霍於奢侈的妝飾方面去呢！</p>
<p>要知道公家各機關，及資本家方面，僱用女職員的本意，是要提倡女子職業的發達，並為婦女界謀生計起見，因為女子的辦事精神，比較的精細一些，其性情也和氣一些，其薪水也比男職員略低，一方面却迎合社會人士的心理，可以招徠顧客，「顧客們都以女職員和靄而樂之」，而於營業前途，大有關係，並不是招請幾位女職員來做花瓶式的點綴品啊！願我親愛的女同志們，大家一致起來，保持着固有的人格和信用，提倡我們女權之發達，我全國二萬萬女同胞，與有光榮也。</p>
<p>至於公家各機關裏頭，也有許多女同志們在這裏服務，其學識和經騐，却是比較的高尚一些，對於無謂的奢侈和虛榮方面，當然已淡薄得多呢！但是地位較高的女職員，其於交際應酬，為潮流和時勢所趨，也有免不了被物質文門所診感）之處，在這點上，却是社會上不能穩定一部分女子生活的一大原因　尤其是在大都市會裏過生活的女子，能儉樸而潔身自好者，的確是難能可貴的人物了。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們婦女界，旣然有了相當的職業，對於經濟方面，自能可以獨立，並可减輕父兄或丈夫的一部分負擔，亦足以補助家庭經濟之不足，大凡為婦女者，不能不體諒父兄或丈夫的擔負恭重，謀生艱難而忽之：</p>
<p>茲乘寫稿之便，將我一位女友孫咉雪女士的儉樸和辦事耐勞的精神寫在下面。</p>
<p>她是一個二十四歲的貧家女，幼年失學，只有初小程度，在五年之前，進某洋行出口部當一個小小的女職員，月薪只有十二元，因為她辦事勤愼，秉性謙和，所以該行的經理先生，也非常器重她，她的智識和經騐，也漸漸地進步了，現在已經升到出口部女職員的管理主任，內有十二個女職員，都受她的指揮，所以她的前程，也未可限量呢。</p>
<p>她的薪水，也漸漸地加到三十五元了，至於她的日常生活，則不過租住亭子間一間，房租四元，每月支出，不到十五元，其衣服的樸素，妝飾的簡單，是常人所不能及的，每日只需飯菜一百數十文，中午在行裏只買光麵一碗充饑，她的節儉，的確是不忘幼時早失怙恃的貧苦境况，所以一年之中，沒有一决到過遊戲塲和電影院，到了星期六的下午和星期日，則做些洗衣女紅及結絨線等工作，所以她的經濟方面，也很充裕，現在已有一千數百元的儲蓄欵項了。總之她的積蓄，是從節儉和勞苦中得來的，像孫女士的品行，和辦事精神，是値得我們女界崇拜的一個好榜樣呢！</p>
<h3>洗滌</h3>

<p>滌去污垢還我清白</p>
<h3>割稻時節的農村婦女</h3>
<p>— 德隣</p>
<p>現在已到了割稻的季節了，秋天的鄕村，是一片富責氣象。阡陌隴頭，充滿了農夫農婦每個的歡笑聲，隻鷄斗酒，覺年樂的圖畫，將在竹籬茅會亂石堆砌的矮牆角落裏展開着。秋！可愛的秋，竟將平素窮荒的田野，鋪滿了黃金，等待人們去收拾</p>
<p>這時的農民，正在上勁地打稻，你到鄉下去，你將看見在秋陽下隨風波揚的；割下了在田裏縱橫雜陳的，那不是結實桑纍金黃色的稻穗麽？這是勞力汗水沃成的代價；這是手胼足胝辛勤的酬報，你瞧，在田裏匍匐割着稻的；擔着在陌頭走的，那不是在勞苦地工作的農夫農婦麽？</p>
<p>金黃色蓬鬆的髮絲，髮髻拖到了背脊上！『油然的汗，在額角上開看曲折的小河流，胸前聳起的兩個乳峰，給一步步的動兒顫動着，沾滿了污泥的小腿，好像一枝泥藕，走上了平原之地，把擔兒歇在鷄棚牛棚的角落裏，跑進了泥磚堆砌的茅屋裏，解開了衣裳的鈕扣，曲了腰把乳頭送進了睡在竹壯裏未及週歲的嬰孩嘴裏，手搖了那竹牀，嘴裏哼着搖搖寶賓睡一覺的調子。這種農婦們的生活，何等的質樸，一天到晚忙碌地勞苦着，日裏除掉了在田裏工作之外，又要洗滌，烹飪飼嬰孩。都市裏的太太們，小姐們，少奶奶們，專事在鈞心鬥角地修飾，競爭美觀，享受着優越的生活，試問曾耗過勞力血汗麽？只憑了肉體來引誘，來交換，終牛做了男子的寄生蟲，還沒有覺悟。</p>

<h3>謝祖儀女士談女青年運動</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>女靑年須知自身責任具獨立人格！　自動的謀生活改善和意識的向上！</p>
<p>上海女靑年會，自喬遷靜安寺路以後，會所比圓明園路時寬暢得多，會務也有相當的發展。可是這Y.W.C.A.，；比起Y.M.C.A.來，那還差得很遠，難道女子眞的不敵男子麽？我希望婦女界也一致奮起，合羣策羣力來苦幹一番，充分地表現婦女服務社會的精神。有人說該會近一年來，經總幹事謝祖儀的擘劃經營，已比從前進步得多了。講到謝女士的學識才能，的確很優越，她原籍四川，從小生長上海中西女學　業後，留美六年，得芝加大學社會學碩士位。當她留美時，會幹過女靑年會的實際工作，她覺得研究社會學，是應該體味現實的社會，從事改良社會的運動，所以幹這項工作，正是用其所學；機會也巧，去年回國到滬，便榮膺　幹事的職務，前天下午我會去訪問，請她發表女靑年運動的意見，大四有二一點，可以報告給讀者。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>到現在，許多人還不很明瞭女靑年的宗旨，女靑年會實在是改造社會的婦女集團，是社會教育的機開，是捐女運動的先導者；領導着舞數熱烈的女青年，本着基督改造社會的使命，培養婦女的自覺心和團結力。它是有國際性與永久性的，不論那一國，君主與民主，或是獨裁與共產的國家，都有女靑年會的組織，譬如像蘇聯，名義上沒有女靑年會，而類似的婦女集團，還是有的。所謂自覺心，是說每一個婦女，必須明暸她本身對於社會國家的責任，與獨立向上的人格，不必人家來提醒，我自己先自覺悟到了。所謂團結刀，便是各個自覺的婦女，應該一致團結，那來謀自身的解放，或參加什麼運動，纔有力量。讒能達到最終的目的。女靑年會把各界婦女組織起來，使她們自動的謀生活的改善，和意識的向上：以本會員有職業婦女，勞動婦女，家庭婦女，以及一般少女，視各方面的年齡與興趣的不同，施以種種有效的訓練，把各人所有的經騐，互相交換，要使大家感覺滿意為止。例如對上層婦女和智識階級，女靑年會要喚起她們忍識人生的鶯義，用自己的才能，智識和金錢，去輔助別人，造就為全人類效勞的領袖。對下層婦女，使她們增長能力，謀自身的解放，不要依靠他人，而做可憐的寄生蟲！</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我們的願望，女靑年會成為各界婦女眞正的中心集團，一切的工作，不但與婦女界發生密切關係，謀女界共同的幸福；更須與社會各方有聯擊的關係，使外界知道這是提高女權幹實際工作的婦女大集團。本會自去年遷入新統後，會務推進上得到許的便利，應有的設備都完備了。會內分為成人教育，平民教育，勞工，少女，職業介紹，宿舍，體育，國際支部等八部。事工方面：依各界婦女的需要，分設研究會，（兒童心里，時事研究，婦女問題，健康生活等，）交誼會，參觀團，名人演溝，旅行，夏令營，補習班，（各國語文，家政，交際，昔樂，打字等），本會承社會士女的贊助，辦理各項事工，以最經濟的方法，求服務最高的效能，希望全上海女同胞，都能贊助我們，參加我們謀大衆福和的活動！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>謝女士對於婦女職業，也發表了一些感想：一現在一般青年，剛出來做事，便流露消極失望的情緒，一半因為自己不努力，一半因限於環境，不能發展其才能；而大多數婦女服務的機會太少，此後希望男子們給婦女服務的機會更多些。媂女自身在求學時期，應充分訓練，充分準備，纔可以應付一切艱鉅的重任。現時婦女界並非有人才，好些地方，實在不會做到「發掘人才」的工作。有些人常批評婦女辦事的不力，究其實際，他們所用的是私人，才具平庸的私人，所以我說上至政府機關，下至公司商號，必須選拔真才，勿埋滅了勇敢有爲的青年，職業界就業的機會，尤須完全平等盡量開拓廣大的路綫，蔗幾人盡其才，物盡其用。婦女們要自身覺悟，勉力　門，女橡自會增高，解放綫有出路！</p>

<h3>下意識者（下）</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>公路汽車的位置原是講不釗舒服兩個字的，一排五個人，差不多已經撑足了，要轉動都難；一帆上車時，祇剩下末排上三個位置，偏是那大胖子又搶得快，只一擠便把一帆擠開了，他自己就搶了一個靠窗的位置，把他那位太太排在第二個，再裏頭個——中央最不舒服的一個。——便承他的情，總算是給一帆留了。而且因為他自己太胖了，他和他太太兩個，足足佔了二個又四分之一的位置，一帆所佔的連一個座位都不滿，沒法祇得勉强塞了下去。</p>
<p>大胖子軍官自然是沒有人注意的，他太太却就成了全車十四位男性（尚有三位女性）的視錢中之處；帆自從在招待所門前跟他們一起乘車上車站來，一直判和伊並肩坐下，原不集對伊注視過，現在瞧所有的人全在發獃似的向伊偷看，便覺得自己彷彿也有向伊看一看會的必要。</p>
<p>看當然就看了，一看之後的印象如可呢？一帆未來以為西北是一片沙漠地的觀念却因因这一看而自覺不能成立了。，同時他又覺得像這樣一位美艷的女性，根本是不記和那肥蠢的軍官同行的，如其那軍官昨夜眞有過毆辱伊的行為，那更是罪大極惡，不可寬恕了。由于這一個感想，便又連帶使他起了憐惜和憎惡的心理，粦惜是對于那女人，憎惡是對於那軍官。</p>
<p>那軍官上車不久，便低下了頭，睡得鼾聲如雷；又且把他那痴肥不堪的身子沒命望他老婆身上靠着，他老婆顯然是很憔悴的樣子，但並不想睡，彷彿正懷着什麼心事。可是伊也支持不了伊丈夫的肥軀，便乘勢倒過一帆這邊來，一帆瞧自己左邊是一個白髮蕭蕭的老婆子，當然不能也乘勢倒過去，祇得用一些力，勉强給他們支持着。這時候那女人的半個身子已差不多全靠在一帆身上了；蓬鬆的秀髮，神秘的香氣，頓時使從不接近異性的一帆感受到了一種神秘的刺激。他幾决想用力把他們擠回過去，却又覺得很不忍，因為他知道這樣是一定要使那擠在中間的軍官太太兩面受敵的，多去祇有勉强忍耐着。可是另外又發生了一層困難，便是他自己的視綫，不知怎樣，生往要集中在這位軍官太太的臉部以及全身的其他各處，而這位軍官太太的眸子似乎也在注意着他，並且透着一種盈欲語的神情。一帆覺得這樣是太危險了，還獻他隨身帶着，幾本小說，便取出一本來瞧着，不料那女人也覺得太煩悶，便格外靠近過來，跟他合看着。一帆應伊遠遠地看過來。不免很吃力，便爽快把這本小說授了過去，自己方卜取出了一本。，伊倒也不拒絕，祗向他嫣然一笑。這一笑便把一帆看書的注意力分散了，他的險雖對着醫，可是書上的字他却並不看見，祇像全變了白紙一樣，有時還會把眼球斜過去，向伊偷看，伊像並不覺得一帆在看伊，可是伊那一本書上的頁數，却好半晌沒有翻動，一頁書約摸看了十多分鐘。後來伊又從自己的皮夾裏取出了一支塗嘴唇用的紅膏來，就在一帆的書上寫了。：「姓？」兩個字，一帆僅低聲應了一個劉字；伊又寫「往？去」，一帆，僅兑蘭州，伊又寫了一個「同」了。一帆漸斬旦大了，便把嘴向那軍官一呶，悄悄問道：「他是誰一？伊仍在上答復，寫了一個「孽二字。這個字一寫出，兩個人不由同時嘆了一口氣。幸而旁人都不會注意，他們便機統一問一答地密談下去，及至汽車開到某處，彼此已非常熟悉了，一帆的右手和伊的左手也已緊緊地屋上兩二三個鐘了；後伊還在書上寫了逃」「逃」兩固大字。一帆却委實無此旦量，祗得悄悄地安慰伊道：「到蘭州再商量」。</p>
<p>這晚大家都在車站附近打尖，一帆實在過不慣那樣齷齪的十坑生活，到半夜還沒有睡去，正坐在一盞黯淡的煤油燈下呆想着那車上飛來的情侶，突然聽得有人槌們，接著就聽得有一條欵抖着的女人聲音在和寓主人爭吵，一帆慌忙搶出去，瞧著，來的真是伊。伊一瞧見他，便來不及的擈過來，讓他擁抱着進了屋子。一帆還沒有坐下，伊就搶著告訴他伊丈夫方才得了緊急命令，搭軍用車先走了。一帆也不知道是歡喜是哀愁，祗覺得自己的一顆心快要跳出腔子來了</p>
<p>第二天，這兩個人便以極張皇的態度，改搭西安車實行私奔了，其時一帆已完全忘掉了他那第一次問世的塑像了，但他也不敢就回上海，他害怕他父　會責罵他；然而，從此他果然不能回去了，因為他跟這軍官太太私奔的一回事，不久就在各處新聞紙上鬧出來了，雕刻家劉一帆變成了給社會所唾棄的罪人。各方面都在譏笑着：</p>

<p>（因閣下分屬同道不必如對答一般病家之細論根葉）（五）上藥外，並服「當歸兒」（Tancno），一日三决，每次一茶匙，至經通為止。（六）可，但燕窩銀耳無多大滋補能力。（七）『利凡命』（Livemin）及Easton’s　Syrup·　（八）整理便通，催進營養，行適當運動（不可過激），減少房事（每星期或半月一决）·（九）婦科醫師，均能治療。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>幷垣又發生和中公司案</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>據天津電，幷垣又發生和中公司案，係無照日僑，田中義郎武田米雄，八日到幷，買通奸民，頂名租屋，設和中公司，走私販毒，屋主悉其眞相，懼獲罪，告官，經晋法院判承租人徒刑，勒令田中退屋，拒不肯，怯院根據華人訴訟常例，杳封房屋，田中電撕毀封條，且愬於河野特務機關，提出抗議，無照僑民，任意在內地賄通奸　，組織走私販毒機關，已破壞國際慣例，而法院根據華人訴訟常例，查封，而田中竟撕毀封條，蔑視我國官憲，莫此為甚。</p>
<p>而對方非但不自覺悟，反提出嚴重抗議，藉口保護僑民，欲增派軍警，日軍部且稱交涉若無結果，將取自衛行動，自衛行動之解說，原來如此？眞是別有解說，眞是聞所未聞，川越大使現在駐京，正欲與我國當局，調整中日關係，而一方又在幷垣製造走私販毒事件，一方在平律演習大換，故華盛頓郵報謂，日本此項操演，實係一種具有確定目的之軍事行動，顯欲强迫中國政府，接受其關於華北之要求，此種操演，無非示威，美報的觀察，天然很看得明白，而我國朝野，對於此種行動，亦豈能認為正當，而寂然無動於中乎。</p>
<p>不過國際問的交涉，自有正常的軌道，假定眞心欲取外交方式交涉，在華北方面，不應該再有此種非常的舉動，假定欲以武力自由行動，則儘可以自由不，而必再取交涉的形式，今一方而使節在京與我政府當局交涉，而另一方面仍不顧一切，自由行動，此種交涉，完全毫無誠意，已可概見，又據昨日東京電傳，須磨總領事携來之中日交涉新訓令案內容，謂此項訓令之根本精神，為日本之要求，始終未有變動，今舍進行最初所定之目的外，別無途徑可循云云，如此則日方之旣定方針，完全不肯讓步，則我國亦惟有所以謀自存自救之策而已，舍此而外，亦尚有何途之從而出哉？</p>
<p>又據倫敦電訊，謂，蘇俄近來因西班牙之內戰關係，而歐洲之法西斯集團勢力，復日益龐大，已使其國際地位，大為削弱，　今日已準備自衛計劃，俾可無須外援以事抵抗，此說誠然，一個國家，不能自力自救，而專靠他人為之援助，本來是靠不住的，我們全國人民，取此最惡劣的環境之下，當思有以自奮，當思所以自救，當思準備作為國最後之犠牲，不要靠入，也不要怕人，當沉着應付，以戰勝此惡劣之環境，方不愧為我中華民國之人民。蓉</p>
<h3>房屋地產評價會</h3>
<p>— 蓉</p>
<p>（內地通訊）「房屋地產評價會」這個名稱是作者杜撰的，因為，現在雖有許多衣襟上掛着證章的「吃公事飯」的在大街小巷要房屋，地產的主人塡上一張表格，沽定房屋地產的價格，但是這項「公事」機關却沒有正式成立，旣是沒有正式機關，自然名稱是沒有預先發表的必要了。作者為了行文便利起見，就姑且以一房屋地淤評價會」稱它了，我想將來也不過改換幾個字而而已，房屋地產已經被判决了要評價是無怯改動的。</p>
<p>我們這個小小的縣城，因為歷史上的關係，與乎有一條鐵路的貫通，自從幾决戰爭之後，也頗為「摩登化」了。最先，是服裝上的變化，除了每天要下田車水分秧的「道地」鄕下人，住在城裏</p>

<p>Venue Arrangement: The ceremony venue is now ready. There are three platforms inside the field, the central one being the main platform. The front is decorated with pine branches and flowers, with blue, white, and red striped cloth underneath. A couplet is hung on both sides of the platform. The upper couplet reads: "Millions contribute their mite; thousands make a robe; ten thousand miles away, sincere hearts offer respect and admiration for the leader." The lower couplet reads: "At forty, he swore an oath; at fifty, we celebrate his birthday; for ten years, he worked tirelessly to establish the nation alone."

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Reflections on His Fiftieth Birthday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued reflections on his fiftieth birthday. The original text is as follows: "I, Zhongzheng, have spent half my life in hardship and worry. I have devoted myself to serving the nation through revolution, but I have not achieved even one percent of my aspirations. Now, suddenly, I have reached the age of fifty. Since before adulthood, I have participated in the revolution and joined the military, receiving education and support from the nation. For more than thirty years, everything I have eaten and worn, and all my necessities of life, have been provided by the nation. None of this is not the result of the people's hard work and sweat. I have received deep and generous grace. Now, I am also deeply grateful to my compatriots at home and abroad, both men and women, old and young, for saving money and purchasing airplanes to offer congratulations. I am moved by this sincerity and greatly encouraged. The exhortations and expectations of my compatriots are so great that I feel ashamed and apprehensive, unsure of how to repay them. Moreover, I recall the teachings of my mentors, the support of my comrades, and the shared hardships and successive sacrifices of my fellow soldiers. The past events are vividly before me. Now, as a survivor of many wars, I am still breathing. Looking up to heaven and down to earth, I truly do not know how to express my feelings. The most profound impression that I cannot forget for a single day is the nurturing and education I received from my mother, who raised me to adulthood. Up to now, the trees on my mother's grave have grown tall, but her hopes for her son to serve the nation, purify society, and not disgrace his ancestors have been delayed and unfulfilled. The Party and the nation face many difficulties, the people's livelihoods are exhausted, and the task of rejuvenation is still far ahead. As time passes and I am ashamed of not fulfilling my duties, I feel uneasy and anxious. Therefore, I will talk about my mother's way of protecting the family and teaching her children, as well as the hardships of growing up as an orphan. I also wish to share the meaning of perseverance and self-improvement with my compatriots and comrades in the cause of serving the nation. I grew up in a remote village. My family was only able to make ends meet. My ancestors and father cultivated and studied for generations, diligent and frugal, accumulating a small amount of wealth. I lost my father at the age of nine, leaving a family of widows and orphans, helpless and without support. At that time, the government was corrupt, and officials and powerful families took advantage of their positions to abuse their power. Because my family was weak, we became a target of their greed, suffering bullying and threats every day. We were often forced to provide labor and had our property seized, unable to protect our ancestral lands. We were even framed in court and subjected to all kinds of humiliation. There was no justice in the village, and many relatives stood by and watched. My mother and I endured our anger and pain, which was beyond description. At this time, I relied on my mother, who based her actions on benevolence, upheld her integrity, and resolutely took on the responsibility of protecting the family and raising her children. Externally, she dealt with powerful families, protected the weak, and internally, she harmonized the family and organized the household. She personally took on all burdens and was careful in all matters. She deeply loved me, as if I were a baby, and her discipline was stricter than that of a teacher. She checked what I carried when I went out, inquired about where I went when I was playing, tested what I had learned when I returned from studying, taught me how to sweep, clean, and respond to people, and taught me the way of hard work and self-reliance. She ordered me to personally do menial and humble work to temper my body and mind. She went to bed late and rose early, putting all her efforts into raising her orphaned son to adulthood. As a child, I was stubborn and did not accept rules. I was also born weak and often bullied. When I grew older, I decided to go abroad to study military affairs. The neighbors were surprised and tried to stop me. It was my mother who overcame all the opposition and struggled to support me in my studies. After hearing about the righteous cause of the revolution, I devoted myself to the Party and the nation, experiencing many hardships and dangers. My relatives warned each other and dared not communicate with me. It was my mother who believed in me without doubt, found ways to encourage me, and worked hard to support the family and strengthen my resolve. In the founding year of the Republic of China, I was finally able to provide for my mother and fulfill her hopes. However, twenty-five years have passed since then. Because warlords seized the country, the Three Principles of the People were not implemented, and the revolutionary cause suffered repeated setbacks. It was my mother who earnestly warned me and encouraged me not to be discouraged or give up, but to persevere to the end. From the time I was nine years old until I was twenty-five years old, my mother was constantly worried and concerned about the difficulties facing the family. After I was twenty-six years old, my mother was always worried about my life as a fugitive. My mother firmly believed that her only responsibility was to rebuild our family. She once told me that as a weak widow, she had experienced unbearable situations in the world. When she was lonely and helpless, she did not know how to protect herself. The only thing she firmly believed in was that her orphaned son must be educated and raised in order to achieve success and that our family must have descendants. Therefore, she should work hard to help herself and not disgrace the family. She also said that difficulties and hardships are common in the world, but self-reliance and self-improvement must be done to the best of one's ability. Therefore, the more difficult the family is, the more important it is to maintain etiquette. The weaker the family is, the more important it is to strengthen one's ambition. The only way for orphans and the weak to survive is to work hard, strive for self-reliance, and persevere. When I decided to join the revolution, my mother often encouraged me with the meaning of serving the nation with filial piety. She said that when recalling the precarious situation of our family in the past, we should extend this feeling to the world so that there would be no more tragedies of the strong oppressing the weak. Therefore, taking care of one's physical needs and seeking worldly fame are not the ways to fulfill filial piety. A man should devote himself to the country and not disgrace his parents. All these wise words were taught to me by my mother on how to conduct myself in the world. Although I have tried to follow her teachings, I have not yet been able to comfort my mother's spirit in heaven. Every time I remember the scenes of my widowed mother and orphaned son relying on each other, I feel that I have no way to repay her immeasurable kindness. I have received grace from the nation and cherish my mother's teachings. I often reflect on my life before the age of fifty and ask myself what kind of person I am. I cannot help but admit that the first twenty-five years of my life were filled with hardship, family difficulties, loneliness, and a struggle to learn and act. The second twenty-five years of my life have been filled with the burden of national difficulties, hardships, and trials. Time passes quickly. I do not know if there will be another twenty-five years of my life, and I do not know what kind of person I will be in those twenty-five years. From deprivation comes recovery. The world's affairs change all the time, and reason makes all things believable. I cannot help but further elaborate on the way for our compatriots to establish the nation. Sages have said that the nation is based on the family. Therefore, the principles of family prosperity and decline can be applied to the nation. The rise and fall of a nation are not constant, just as the rise and fall of a family are not fixed. It may not be able to withstand the blows and eventually perish, or it may rise up and become rich and strong. It all depends on the awareness and efforts of its people. The affairs of the world are no different, and the historical records of newly emerging countries in the past hundred years are sufficient models for us today. There is no harvest without labor, nor is there fruitless cultivation. Only by combining consistent sincerity and continuous effort can any difficulties be overcome. As far as my personal experience is concerned, my family was weak and in danger when I was young. However, the invasion of powerful families could trap my mother and me in difficulties, but it could not crush my mother's ambition to protect the family and teach her children, nor could it prevent my family from seeking more happiness. It is clear that safety, danger, good fortune, and misfortune in the world are all self-inflicted and that turning weakness into strength must rely on self-reliance. Since the death of Sun Yat-sen fourteen years ago, our country has been beset by internal and external troubles. Initially, the red flames covered the sky, and the Party and the nation were in danger. Then, foreign invasions occurred frequently, and the Northeast was lost. During this time, suspicion and slander arose, and the lives of the people and the fate of the nation were uncertain for more than ten years. The urgency and severity of the situation were much greater than when I lost my father at the age of nine. However, I still believe that temporary difficulties are not to be worried about, the decline of justice is not to be feared, and the weakness of national power is not to be lamented. The key to survival and prosperity lies in whether our people have the determination to be diligent, know shame, work hard, and strive for self-reliance. If all my compatriots can devote themselves to serving the nation with the ambition to rebuild the family as orphans, the country's transition from danger to safety can be expected soon. If all the women in our country can devote themselves to managing the household and teaching their children, understand etiquette, and understand justice, it will be greatly beneficial to the nation's prosperity, strength, and happiness. As far as my personal life is concerned, from my childhood to the present, I have benefited greatly from the family education of my virtuous mother and the assistance of my good wife. If all the 200 million women in our country can protect their families and teach their children like my widowed mother, and if all sons can protect their country, how can we not revive China? In general, the way for both the nation and individuals to compete in the world is none other than self-reliance, self-help, and self-improvement. Only self-reliance can ensure survival, only self-help can gain the help of others, and when a country is declining and weak, its people should be aware of the dangers of their environment, understand the weakness of their own position, not be intimidated by violence and lose their courage, and not be obsessed with quick results and disrupt their hearts. This is the meaning of hard work and self-improvement, which is also the key to national revival. It should be consistently and sincerely practiced from beginning to end. The teachings of our ancestors place filial piety first. Sun Yat-sen once said that our people have their own way of establishing a country and should not merely imitate the superficial aspects of foreign countries, nor should they copy the hegemony of imperialists. The eight virtues of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" are the inherent spirit and morality of our Chinese nation, and filial piety is especially emphasized in Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It can be seen that the way to establish China has always been based on filial piety. The greatest form of filial piety is to respect one's parents, which means not disgracing them. Respecting one's parents means carrying forward the legacy of our ancestor, the Yellow Emperor. Not disgracing one's parents means not bringing shame upon them. With the long history and culture of our nation, if we do not destroy ourselves, who can destroy us? If all my compatriots have the awareness of "being ashamed of not being as good as others" and are vigilant day and night in their determination to wipe out shame and strive for strength, never giving up, then the meaning of not disgracing one's parents will be achieved. I feel deeply ashamed of not fulfilling my responsibilities to my family and nation. I have not lived up to the expectations of the people, nor have I repaid my widowed mother for her hard work in raising me. How can I dare to believe that I can shoulder the heavy responsibility of protecting the family and teaching the children that my widowed mother had during her lifetime? I will try my best to fulfill my duty to serve the nation to the best of my ability. However, reflecting on the times and applying small things to big things, I hope that all my compatriots will consider themselves orphans, encourage themselves with sincerity, unite together, work hard, and strive for self-reliance to preserve our nation's history for thousands of years. My intentions are sincere, and my expectations are high. If the wish to repay the nation is not fulfilled for one day, the suffering of the people will not be alleviated for one day. Therefore, I will not hesitate to state what I have felt today, to reveal the mistakes of the past, and to make amends in the future. If all my compatriots at home and abroad do not consider my words to be wrong, understand the way to national prosperity, work together diligently, and jointly dedicate themselves to the fundamental path of serving the nation, then this is my greatest wish, and it is also what I hope to repay the nation and all my compatriots."

<h3>Ministry of Propaganda Issues Appeal to the Nation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department issued an appeal to the nation for the airplane presentation celebration. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"This year, October 31st is the fiftieth birthday of our Party leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The entire nation is filled with excitement and joy, spreading the news to each other. Out of sincere admiration and support, there has been an airplane presentation to offer congratulations. In the past few months, people across the country have enthusiastically donated money and purchased airplanes to present them, fearing that they might be late. The enthusiasm is unprecedented. This is because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's great achievements, benevolent heart, and virtue have inspired and attracted people, and it is not accidental.</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been frugal and humble, not wanting his birthday to cause society to waste money. He has instructed the nation to stop celebrations. His respectful and modest virtue is a model for the world. However, from the perspective of our people, the current fundraising and purchase of airplanes to present to the nation is purely out of love for the leader and enthusiasm for strengthening national defense, and it cannot be stopped. This is very different from the common custom of offering toasts and praises, and it has its own significant meaning. I would like to mention a few points to inform the nation:</p>
<p>1.  Celebrating with airplane presentations is a way to express the people's sincere support for the leader. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the nation has faced difficulties, with both external and internal troubles pressing upon it. Relying on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inherit Sun Yat-sen's legacy and lead the National Revolution, wherever the righteous army went, the nation followed. The remnants of the warlords were wiped out. Then, with the red flames spreading and several provinces falling, he once again led the military to suppress and appease, and after years of hard struggle, the red disaster in various provinces was pacified. He then devoted his full efforts to building and consolidating the national foundation, completing the unification of the country and opening a new era in the history of the Republic of China. This is something that our people cannot forget for a single day. At this birthday, the whole country is united in presenting airplanes to celebrate, which is precisely to express the sincere support for the leader and love for the Party and the nation.</p>
<p>2.  Celebrating with airplane presentations is a way to show the people's voluntary efforts to strengthen national defense. In modern military and transportation, aviation is the most important. The saying "without air defense, there is no national defense" is true. French General Foch said, "The second world war will be decided in the air." This is because future wars have moved from the horizontal to the vertical. It is not enough to rely solely on the army and navy to succeed, and the final victory of future wars will be determined by the air force. Recently, the world's powers have been making the development of their air forces their top priority. The emptiness of our national defense and the lack of strength are undeniable facts. If we sincerely want to save the country, we must first build a solid foundation for air defense. Moreover, developing the air force is cost-effective and has great results. If the people of the whole country can enthusiastically donate, it will not be difficult to see results soon. Therefore, today's airplane presentation is nothing less than the beginning of our nation's self-reliance and the expression of our people's voluntary efforts to strengthen national defense. In other words, we can regard this event as the beginning of the development of air defense.</p>
<p>3.  Celebrating with airplane presentations is a way to show the people's support for peace and unity. Domestic unity is the first step in saving the country. This is already a consensus among patriots. In the past, the main reason for our country's weakness was that it could not unite. In the past ten years, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been running around for the country amidst internal and external troubles, finally making the people's hearts in the country move towards unity. The situation of national unity has been permanently established. Today, the people of the country are aware that without sincere unity, it will not be enough to save the country. This is enough to be considered a sign of the awakening of the national spirit. From now on, our Chinese nation has begun to acquire the basic strength to save itself. The reason for this is that it is not only thanks to the inspiration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's great spirit, but also the achievements he has made through his hard struggle. Therefore, the airplane presentation can also be regarded as an expression of the people's celebration of peace and unity and the consolidation of sincere unity. It is not only to show the people's enthusiasm for supporting the leader and strengthening national defense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our people should deeply understand one thing during the airplane presentation to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday. After national unity, how should we consolidate the national foundation and revive the nation? There are many things to do, and we must all work together. From now on, the responsibility of the people will increase day by day, and the burden on our leader will also become increasingly difficult. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's tireless work and dedication to the country are evident to the people. We sincerely support the leader and should also consider the current environment of the country and the leader's hard work for the country. From now on, the whole country should unite under the leadership's guidance, follow the leader's propositions with absolute faith, and continue to struggle with consistent sincerity. All actions should be based on the greatest welfare of the entire nation. The New Life Movement, the National Economic Construction Movement, the Frugality Movement, and the Labor Service are all urgent tasks at present. If we follow this path, the national fortune will become stronger and the revolution will be completed. This is why we support the leader, and it is also why we serve the nation. This is especially what our people should do after today's airplane presentation. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Congratulations from the President of the Control Yuan on His Birthday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The 31st of this month is Vice-Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. The Control Yuan, through its president, respectfully composed birthday greetings to offer congratulations. The text is recorded below. "Toiling with worry for the sake of national prosperity" is an ancient teaching with validity. Our nation has already experienced the hardships of initial creation. The period of political tutelage is approaching completion, and unification is being successfully announced. The people of the nation are urged to be cautious and attend to the restoration. In the history of our nation, a new era is truly dawning, and Mr. Chiang's fiftieth birthday coincides with this moment. The people of the nation are all competing to offer aircraft as birthday gifts for Mr. Chiang. This is not just a celebration for one person or one family, but a cause for joy and encouragement for the entire nation, with voices singing praises in unison. Right-Ren has served alongside Mr. Chiang in revolutionary work, and having a relatively intimate knowledge of his life and character, it is my duty to offer words to express my heartfelt congratulations. I have often contemplated the times and admired contemporary figures. Those who link their own fate to the destiny of the era, concerned about the safety of the nation and the people, as well as the rise and fall of society, exist in every country in the world. However, Mr. Chiang, with his extraordinary talent, inherited the legacy of the Premier, leading the national revolution and shouldering the great responsibility of party affairs, military affairs, politics, and social transformation. He stands out above the common, possessing the strengths of all contemporary leaders. His divine work has been rarely matched in history. In recent years, Mr. Chiang, amidst his military and pacification efforts, has engaged in political reform and educational innovation, dedicating much effort to the cause of national revival. Therefore, I will recount a few matters for the people of the nation, so that those who admire Mr. Chiang will not only be amazed by the magnitude of his achievements but will also be convinced of the greatness of his virtue and accomplishments. When a nation stands in the world, it must have the will to rise. However, in today's turbulent international situation, the spirit and morality of the nation are essential resources for establishing a country. Our nation's politics has always emphasized civil virtue, rarely speaking of military achievements. As a result, there is a habit of valuing civil matters over military ones. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, literary composition has been used to select officials. As a result of these malpractices, scholars buried themselves in classics and became empty and impractical. They were content with inaction and gradually became weak. The vitality of the nation was thus diminished. The Qing scholar Li Shugu said, "When the spirit of writing and ink is abundant, the spirit of economics is lacking. The demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was due to this." His words are truly filled with emotion. After the opening of the seas, the utilitarian theories of Europe and Asia came along with their machinery and technology. Human desires ran rampant, and customs became extravagant. The lives of the people lost their normal course. In terms of self-cultivation, they lost their grasp of the eight virtues and four principles. In terms of behavior, they fell into a state of licentiousness and disorganization. If this continued, the nation would no longer be a nation. Mr. Chiang was deeply concerned about this, so he advocated the New Life Movement to correct the evils of the time, restoring our nation's inherent virtues from within and drawing on the civilization of the world from without. In less than two years, the wind swept through the grass. The things of muddling along and seeking temporary ease, and the behavior of seeking profit and forgetting righteousness, are already rarely seen in public society. The hearts of the people throughout the country have been revitalized. All of this is due to Mr. Chiang's accumulated diligence and dedication, disciplining himself in a regulated life, and thus being able to inspire the masses, change customs, and make great contributions to the nation and the people. Mr. Chiang also believes that the people of the nation, both in and out of government, are accustomed to being weak and indulging in a lethargic atmosphere. Their muscles and bones are becoming lax, and their physical strength is declining. Therefore, he also promoted labor service to invigorate the nation's sluggish spirit. Taking "action as the starting point" and adding the basic concepts of his revolutionary philosophy is also for this reason. Mr. Chiang believes that "action" is the only driving force for creating everything in the universe. Being proactive is the source of all prosperity for the nation, people, and society, and being passive is a good remedy for saving human corruption, laziness, and the nation's decline and danger. This is the same as the "work and training" and "labor obligations" advocated by various modern countries. The principles set by Mr. Chiang are all based on the spirit of the Chinese Kingly Way, with "altruism" and "upward progress" as their norms. Their meaning is truly vast. Mr. Chiang once said that people in the 20th century should all be independent individuals and, at the same time, social beings. Only as independent individuals can they progress upward to create their future continued life. Only as social beings should they also be altruistic to improve the well-being of all mankind. Only then can the true meaning and value of life be expressed. Therefore, the people's diligent service should not only serve the nation and society with the spirit of labor, but also the individual's life should be integrated with the life of mankind to create an eternally continuous life for mankind. These words are excellent, how broad and sincere they are! In recent years, our nation's national economy has been repeatedly attacked by the world's financial storms and has fallen into a state of acute panic. The countryside is desolate, industries are declining, financial capital is experiencing frequent crises, foreign trade is shrinking, and the lives of ordinary people are barely surviving on the road to starvation. Mr. Chiang deeply believes that this is the greatest crisis facing China today. He is deeply concerned and thinks hard to find a way for the nation to regenerate itself. Therefore, he has widely advocated the National Economic Construction Movement to awaken the nation's self-awareness, to concentrate all the forces of the government, the people, and various public and private groups, to simultaneously construct material and spiritual aspects, to alleviate the current crisis and the people's hardships. The National Economic Construction Movement is spreading throughout the country, and practical achievements are now being promoted. On the negative side, we are abolishing excessive taxes, reducing export duties, strictly prohibiting the excessive issuance of paper money, and stopping speculative activities to eliminate obstacles to the development of the national economy. On the positive side, we are improving agriculture, revitalizing agriculture, protecting minerals, adjusting labor relations, opening up roads, developing transportation construction, controlling the economy, and supporting industry and commerce, internally seeking to increase total production and solve the needs of people's livelihoods, and externally increasing export products to seek trade balance. Recently, the National Government increased the capital of the three central national banks to seek stability in the social economy and relief for agriculture, industry, and commerce. This is also the beginning of national economic construction. From this perspective, Mr. Chiang's National Economic Construction Movement plan is broad, profound, and closely aligned with the current needs of the Chinese people, and is a necessary resource for the construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Compared with the restoration policies currently being pursued in the United States and the five-year construction plan of Soviet Russia, it is not inferior. The domestic and international environment we are in today is more dangerous and urgent than ever before in history. External troubles are rampant, the territory is shrinking daily, and the nation is sinking and facing destruction. However, Mr. Chiang is loyal and upright, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, facing the people in a situation of blood and tears. His determination is unwavering, and he does not hesitate to take risks and overcome difficulties. He has been able to wash away flaws, dissolve divisions, and promote love and sincerity in the world. He has been able to guide the current situation of peace and unification, and the difficulties of the future may be even greater than today. I firmly believe that Mr. Chiang will be able to use his perseverance and sincerity to overcome all difficulties, control all affairs, and revive our nation and people, to complete the great cause of the Three People's Principles revolution, and to lead the four hundred million compatriots to the realm of benevolence and longevity. Therefore, I recite the poem "Nanshan You Tai" (Southern Mountain Has Arborvitae): "Happy is the prince, the light of the country. Happy is the prince, may you live ten thousand years without end." This is to celebrate the nation and also what we offer in our congratulations. (Central News Agency telegram, 30th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Military Exercises in Beiping and Tianjin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged a Protest</h3>
<p>Forcibly Occupying Civilian Houses and Cutting Off Transportation, Illegal, Unreasonable, and Shocking</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the 26th of this month, the "military" stationed in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places has been conducting large-scale exercises for ten days, centered on Fengtai, including Beiping, Tianjin, and the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The number of participating troops has reached more than 7,000. They have forcibly occupied hundreds of civilian houses in the suburbs of Tianjin, forcing out residents. At the same time, they have conscripted civilian laborers, firewood, and other items, causing great disturbance. The continuous tense exercises have cut off transportation in the nearby areas. Most of the civilian houses in the Dazhigu and Shicheng areas have been damaged, and crops have also been cut down. It is truly shocking that foreign troops in our country's territory have taken such illegal and unreasonable actions. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Japanese military's actions violate treaties and international law and undermine our country's sovereignty, and has sent a note to the Japanese Embassy to protest.

<h3>The Truth About the Japanese Forcibly Renting Civilian Houses and Causing Trouble in Taiyuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged a Protest with the Japanese Side, the Tianjin Japanese Consulate Has Sent Police to Taiyuan Urgently, Japanese Police Are Still Stationed at Tanaka's House</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The city house at No. 4 Ansi Street in Taiyuan was previously verbally rented by Wang Junde, a Hebei native, from the landlord. However, the landlord discovered that Wang had a background and often ordered him to find a reliable guarantor to ensure that he would not rent the house on behalf of others. Wang avoided showing his face because he had no reliable guarantor. Suddenly, two Japanese, Takeada Sueo and Tanaka Yoshitaro, forcibly occupied the house, claiming that they had entrusted Wang to rent the house and intended to set up a business. The two sides were unable to reach a decision. Then, Takeada left Taiyuan for Tianjin, and Tanaka frequently came to the house to inspect it. On the 26th of this month, Takeada returned to Jin and occupied the house again. On the 27th, the Jin authorities, together with the street chief, the deputy street chief, and the Japanese servant, counted and sealed the medicines and equipment in the house that were inconvenient to carry and temporarily stored them in the room. They escorted Takeada Sueo to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou, and the landlord and the police bricked up the door and sent police to patrol it. Then, Tanaka Yoshitaro suddenly gathered five Japanese, including Otsugake Takezo, Yamada Yoshiichi, etc., wearing military uniforms and carrying pistols, broke open the bricked door, occupied the house, drank alcohol, made noise, and threw bricks at the street, breaking the glass of nearby shops. They also hung a wooden sign at the door, written in Japanese, meaning that the house was temporarily managed by the Japanese army for reasons. This is the truth about the Japanese forcibly renting houses and causing trouble in Taiyuan. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Japanese side. The Japanese Allied News Agency's claim that there is anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiyuan and that Shanxi officials are expelling Japanese merchants is obviously inconsistent with the facts. (Central News Agency telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The investigator Cheng Maoyu, from the Taiyuan Japanese Police Outpost, came to Tianjin on the 30th to report that the Hezhong Company, established by Tanaka, was located at No. 1 Fangyou East Lane in Taiyuan. Next door was the Xieshan Hospital, established by Wang Junde, a Chinese. At the end of July, the Xieshan Hospital moved to Anshijie, and Wang privately rented the former site to Tanaka to convert it into a drug dealership. The Taiyuan ban prohibited private rentals to Japanese, so someone reported it, and the court ruled that the house should be returned to the original owner for rent. Tanaka refused, and a dispute arose this month when the court enforced the order. (Special telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nishi, a secretary at the Japanese Consulate in Taiyuan, sent a telegram to the Tianjin Consulate on the 30th reporting the current situation of the Japanese residents, saying that 32 men and women were being housed at the Takahashi Mansion and requesting more police protection. Japanese police are stationed at both Tanaka Yoshitaro's Hezhong Company and residence. According to the Tianjin Japanese Consulate, there are a total of 29 Japanese residents and 4 Koreans in Taiyuan, and they are all safe. (Special telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Special Issue for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday</p>
<h3>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's Family Education and Academic Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Shao Yuanchong</p>
<p>Written for Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday</p>
<p>Historians, when observing central figures of an era, should not only understand the greatness of their achievements but also recognize their usual thoughts and academic cultivation. They should not only pay close attention to the characteristics of their personality but also deeply understand the family environment and family education that shaped these characteristics. Based on the above two conditions, I would like to provide a faithful description of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's family education and academic cultivation, as far as I know, to the comrades and compatriots who respect him.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years before the founding of the Republic of China (Dinghai year in the lunar calendar - 1887 in the solar calendar), Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was born in Xikou Town, Jinxi, Fenghua, Zhejiang. That year, Sun Yat-sen transferred from Guangzhou to the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, affiliated with the Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, and discussed revolution with classmates such as Chen Shaobai and Lu Haodong.</p>
<p>Most of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's ancestors were farmers. His grandfather, Duke Yu Biao, changed to engaging in commerce, especially managing the salt and tea industries, and the family's livelihood gradually became prosperous. Duke Yu Biao was also a kind-hearted elder who helped relatives and friends with weddings, funerals, or emergencies. He also fully supported local public welfare undertakings, such as road repairs and dike construction, and personally supervised them to ensure their perfection. The area near Jinxi where he lived was the junction of Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou prefectures. There was a ridge called Wuling, which was a necessary passage for people from the three prefectures. Because the area was desolate and sparsely populated, there were no teahouses or places to eat. Duke Yu Biao prepared dry food and tea at the Buddhist temple on the ridge to provide for passersby, without interruption for many years, and the passersby were very grateful. Duke Yu Biao was also knowledgeable in medicine and often treated people. He also liked to study Buddhism, thus promoting his spirit of benevolence and universal love to help people and save the world. He was strict in managing the family but kind to people. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was often sick in his childhood, and Duke Yu Biao often treated him himself and cherished him very much. Therefore, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek had a deep impression of Duke Yu Biao in his childhood, and Duke Yu Biao's virtues of strict family management, kindness to people, and dedication to society had a great influence on Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's later cultivation.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's father, Duke Su'an, was straightforward in nature, fair in dealing with affairs, sincere in treating people, self-disciplined and thrifty, and had a resolute appearance. Compared with Duke Yu Biao, he was more masculine in character. When Duke Yu Biao was managing the salt industry, the family was quite wealthy. However, when Duke Su'an was in his teens, it was during the reigns of Emperor Daoguang and Emperor Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty. The Taiping Rebellion rose, and Zhejiang was often a battleground for the Taiping Army and the Qing Army. As a result, the local area was devastated, and all industries were abandoned. Duke Yu Biao's lifelong management of the salt industry was also destroyed. Later, when the military situation in Zhejiang stabilized slightly, Duke Su'an inherited his father's ambition to revitalize the salt industry, giving full play to his capable abilities. In just a few years, he completely restored it. In his hometown, he liked to mediate disputes and uphold justice, and he worked hard for public welfare undertakings. He also made every effort to promote local education and provided assistance to many people who sought education without funds, thus cultivating a large number of talents. Regarding family education, he once said to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and his brothers: "Because I inherited the legacy of my ancestors in my youth, I cannot serve the country to the best of my ability. However, I still wish to make considerable efforts in local public welfare, education, and improving customs, so that the local area can be peaceful and the family can be harmonious. You can concentrate on studying, and if you achieve something in the future, you can also make up for my shortcomings." This sincere family instruction greatly moved Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and his brothers. Although Duke Su'an loved his sons very much in his later years, he still taught and supervised them very strictly and had even higher expectations. Therefore, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's later efforts in his studies and national affairs were indeed closely related to Duke Su'an's family education. Duke Su'an had so many virtues and characteristics that greatly influenced Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's spirit. Unfortunately, due to lifelong hard work, he was unable to enjoy a long life and passed away at the age of fifty-three. At that time, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was only nine years old, and his grief can be imagined.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek not only deeply benefited from the family education of his grandfather and father in his youth but also greatly influenced by the teachings of his mother, Madam Wang. Because Mr. Chiang Kai-shek lost his father at a young age, Madam Wang took on the responsibilities of both parents, teaching her son tirelessly. When he made mistakes, she would severely reprimand and punish him without any leniency. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek went out to study at the age of thirteen, Madam Wang tearfully instructed him: "Since your father's death, I have worked hard to educate you, not because I want you to seize high office and possess great wealth, but because I hope you will love yourself for the country and preserve the good name of your ancestors." She often gave such instructions, so Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was very moved. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek went to Japan to study military science at the age of eighteen, Madam Wang greatly praised him and raised travel expenses and tuition fees to enable him to make the trip. She also made the family life more frugal so that tuition fees would not be lacking. In the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, the Wuchang Revolutionary Army rose up, and the Jiangzhe area also continued to respond. At that time, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was supervising the army in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. When relatives and friends in his hometown heard the news, they were mostly extremely frightened, but Madam Wang was not panicked at all and said, "A man serves the country, and death is death. What is there to worry about?" Later, when Jiangzhe was restored and news of victory reached home, Madam Wang remained calm and continued to warn him in her family letters to do his best for the country and never slacken. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was in Shanghai, although he repeatedly decided to welcome her to live with him, Madam Wang only stayed for a few days and returned to her hometown to live her simple life. When the revolution failed for the second time, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek fled overseas. He once wrote to his mother in a public and urgent manner, and Madam Wang tried her best to help him. She did not listen to those who advised him to return north, and everyone admired her courageous and compassionate spirit. Sun Yat-sen presented a horizontal plaque inscribed "Educating Children with Excellence" in the fifth year of the Republic of China to praise her. She continued to carry on Duke Su'an's ambition to devote herself to local public welfare and education and to help her relatives and clansmen. She also liked to study Buddhist scriptures, and she was able to understand the essentials of the Surangama Sutra, the Vimalakirti Sutra, and the Diamond Sutra, which also had a significant impact on her self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Chiang Kai-shek received strict family education from his grandparents and parents from his youth to adulthood, he already had a solid foundation for physical and mental self-cultivation. The inherited qualities of eagerness for public good and righteousness were also the innate seeds for his later efforts in national affairs. All of his characteristics, such as his strong personality, passionate emotions, courageous spirit, and simple life, were related to his family instructions. From this, it can be seen how close the relationship between family education and personality cultivation is.</p>
<p>According to what Mr. Chiang Kai-shek told me before, his revolutionary sentiments were cultivated because, after his ancestors moved to Zhejiang after the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty ruled China, and Chiang's ancestors had left instructions warning their descendants not to become Qing officials. Therefore, this became an important precept in family education. Later, after Mr. Chiang Kai-shek went to Japan to study, he was guided by Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui. He had a deeper understanding of the great cause of revolution. Later, he became friends with Mr. Chen Qimei and others, so his revolutionary sentiments became even more passionate. However, the initial seeds of his revolutionary thought can also be said to be closely related to family education.</p>
<p>The above narration provides a deep understanding of the relationship between Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's temperament, the cultivation of revolutionary thought, and his family education. Now, let's briefly describe Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's academic cultivation.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards learning is to work hard and do practical things. He never hopes to use simple, labor-saving, and time-saving methods to obtain a deep academic foundation. He applied the learning methods of many scholars in the past, such as circling and marking a book from beginning to end, writing notes, adding marginal notes, and using red pens to highlight or mark the key points in the book. He used these methods to carefully study many books that he considered essential to read carefully. His greatest regret in the setbacks of the Dongjiang military campaign in the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic of China was the loss of several diaries and several books that had been annotated and circled. In the study at his home in Fenghua, the principal's office of the Huangpu Military Academy in Guangzhou, and some of his personal books, many kinds of books can be found that have been circled, annotated, and marked with attention symbols in red and blue pens. These are all the results of his hard work in learning.</p>
<p>In his early years, in order to develop a habit of perseverance, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek wrote a diary every day. It can be said that there has been no interruption in the past twenty years. Although he cannot write in great detail due to busy schedules, he always writes a few lines or a few sentences every day. In addition to recording events and the books he has read, the content of his diary also faithfully records his self-examination of his temperament and self-cultivation, such as whether his temperament is impetuous, whether he is overly harsh to others and makes them feel embarrassed, whether distracting thoughts arise from time to time, and so on. As for the records of the secret period in Shanghai, he often used hidden language to represent them. For example, when the Zhaohe warship launched an attack in Shanghai in the winter of the fourth year of the Republic of China, the diary used "school meeting" to represent "Zhaohe launched" and "ringing the bell in the auditorium" to represent "the navy opened fire." Therefore, if this extremely historically valuable handwritten diary is published in the future, many facts and hidden languages ​​in it may have to be explained by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek himself.</p>
<p>In addition to Sun Yat-sen's complete legacy, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has benefited the most from the writings of Wang Yangming and Zeng Guofan in terms of basic books on self-cultivation. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek not only systematically read and annotated the complete works of these two families from beginning to end but also repeatedly read and reviewed them and could be said to be never tired of reading them. Yangming and Xiangxiang both created achievements in difficult times, which gave Mr. Chiang Kai-shek a great spiritual encouragement when he encountered difficulties and setbacks. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle, especially the dozens of days of hardship in Guangzhou, provided a genuine training in practice, which was the most beneficial part of his life. Of course, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has read many books in the past decades, but the basic books that he has read carefully are only about thirty kinds. Now, I will list the catalogue of books that he himself listed and selected for reading in the past few years:</p>
<p>Five Classics, Four Books, Confucius' Family Sayings, Zuo Zhuan, Strategies of the Warring States, Six Secret Teachings, Sun Tzu, Wu Tzu, Zhuangzi, Han Feizi, Chu Ci, Records of the Grand Historian, Zizhi Tongjian, History of the Qing Dynasty, Western History, History of the European War, History of the Franco-Prussian War, History of Napoleon's Wars, History of the Russo-Japanese War, Barker's Tactics, Various Military Science Studies, Just War Theory, Asian Geography, World Geography, Ancient Prose Compilation, Various Collections of Zhuge Liang, Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, and Qi Jiguang, Complete Works of Zeng Guofan, Complete Works of Hu Linyi, Collection of Zuo Zongtang, Collection of Luo Bingzhang, Collection of Li Hongzhang, History of Chinese Philosophy, Psychology, Statistics, Sociology, Economics</p>
<p>Analyzing the contents of the above-listed thirty-odd kinds of books, it can be said that they include Chinese ethical thought, Chinese political philosophy, Chinese history and world history, Chinese military science principles and world military science, Chinese literature, Chinese and foreign geography, and a portion of basic social sciences. If they can be integrated and understood, they can indeed create the basic theories of politics. These dozens of books are the foundation of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's academic cultivation, and I hope everyone will carefully understand them.</p>
<p>The above narration is just a fragment of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's academic cultivation and family education, but it can prove that those who want to emulate Mr. Chiang Kai-shek should work hard in his actual life, in his actual efforts, from the plain, arduous, and subtle aspects. In general, fathers and brothers who want to cultivate their children into talents should also emulate Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's respectful family education, loving but not condoning, and give their children an example of how to be a person in everything they do. In this way, even if the children do not necessarily have extraordinary achievements in the future, at least they can become people who are disciplined and self-reliant and will not burden society. The survival, development, and progress of a country certainly require a few leaders who can overcome difficulties to shoulder heavy responsibilities, but they also require a large number of good citizens who are eager for public good, abide by the law, are generous and helpful, and are self-reliant and self-sufficient to maintain social stability. This is an additional hope at the end of this article, and I hope readers will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Striving for National Survival by Concentrating National Strength and Supporting the Leader</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>—Speech at the Shanghai National Military Training Association's Dinner Celebrating Chairman Chiang's Fiftieth Birthday—</p>
<p>Today, all comrades in Shanghai who are responsible for national military education and civic training are holding a dinner party here to celebrate Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. We should have a deep understanding of the significance of this grand celebration.</p>
<p>Comrades, what is China most in need of today? What China most needs today is:</p>
<p>An enlightened leader;</p>
<p>A party with principles;</p>
<p>A strong and powerful government.</p>
<p>If we have an enlightened leader, a party with principles, and a strong and powerful government, not only can the current serious national crisis be resolved, but even if it is ten times more serious, we can have the strength to overcome it!</p>
<p>In the past, our general public did not clearly understand the conditions for saving the country from its difficulties. Therefore, we could not concentrate all our strength to contribute to the leader, and our leader had no way to use the strength of the whole country to overcome the current environment and resolve the current national crisis. If, ten years ago, our people had such awareness, knowing to support the leader, support the party, and support the government, I dare to believe that today's national crisis would never have occurred; even if it had, it would have been overcome and resolved long ago!</p>
<p>However, the people now are awakened: they have deeply recognized the seriousness of the national crisis; they have deeply recognized the way to save the country from its difficulties; they are ready to sacrifice everything, and willingly and sincerely contribute all their strength to our leader, to be used by our leader: so that our leader can use this majestic and great strength to save the current crisis and revive our nation. This is not an overly optimistic fantasy, but a reality in practice. Just look at the recent awareness of Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday among our people across the country, and you can see the proof. The people, who never cared about national affairs, are now extremely excited; whether men, women, old, or young, almost everyone knows about Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday; they all know to express their respect for Chairman Chiang; they all believe that Chairman Chiang is a persevering and outstanding leader, and the savior of the nation and the country. This kind of national unity and enthusiastic support of the people was expressed even more thoroughly at the naming ceremony of the Zhongzheng Squadron held in this city a few days ago. That day, we had over ten thousand people at the Longhua Airport. Why did over ten thousand people come to participate in the naming ceremony that day? Were they just there to watch the excitement? No, they were there to participate in the naming ceremony of the Zhongzheng Squadron aircraft, because the significance of the Zhongzheng Squadron naming ceremony is very significant; it is a solemn ceremony to strengthen national power and consolidate national defense. From the manifestation of the national spirit that day, we can say that the Chinese people now have recognition, have awareness, know how to support the leader, support the party, and support the government; they have recognized that these three conditions must be met; with these three conditions, the country can be revived. And among these three conditions, the most important is still people. As the ancient saying goes: "He who gains the people will prosper." Therefore, we must have an enlightened leader in order to establish a strong party and government. Although the national crisis is very serious now, we are very optimistic; we already have a persevering and outstanding, enlightened leader who leads the people; our 450 million people across the country can also unanimously express their enthusiasm for support; willingly and sincerely willing to concentrate all their strength and contribute it to the leader, so that our leader can use this powerful force to deal with and overcome the current national crisis!</p>
<p>Everyone here is responsible for military education, and military education is the most important part of public education. The fact that the people of Shanghai have such awareness today, and have such recognition of the leader, the party, and the government, cannot but be attributed to the efforts of your work. Therefore, I should express my respect for your past achievements today. However, the work ahead is even more arduous. Today, we must seek survival from death. Only when 450 million compatriots can concentrate their strength, support the leader, and sacrifice for the country, will the country have a way to survive, and the nation can be revived. Therefore, we cannot but hope that you will redouble your efforts in the future! Finally, let us shout loudly:</p>
<p>Long live Chairman Chiang!</p>
<p>Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!</p>
<p>Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Yu Feipeng</p>
<p>October 31st, the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, is the fiftieth birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan. The International Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters plans to publish a special collection of congratulatory articles. I, Peng, was asked to contribute an article. I humbly believe that Chairman Chiang's achievements in recreating the Republic of China and unifying China are almost universally known, seen, and spoken of by the people of the country. There is no need for me, Peng, to describe even a fraction of them.</p>
<p>However, my relationship with Chairman Chiang is that we were from the same village in our youth and have been under his command for a long time. I have followed him on the battlefield for nearly twenty years. Having been close to him for a long time, I deeply know that what distinguishes him from ordinary people is not only his outstanding talent and strategy, but also his great personality. The reason why he can cultivate this great personality is entirely due to the two virtues of loyalty and filial piety.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is naturally intelligent, with unparalleled perseverance. He was rich in national revolutionary ideas in his early years. After joining the Tongmenghui in the late Qing Dynasty, he first followed Chen Qimei in launching an uprising in Shanghai, achieving remarkable military successes. Then, he followed President Sun Yat-sen, on the one hand, dedicating himself to military construction, establishing a revolutionary foundation, and on the other hand, planning military expeditions to eliminate warlords in the North and South, exhausting his wisdom and considering success or failure, gain or loss, life or death as secondary, in order to assist President Sun, support the Three Principles of the People, and consolidate the party and the country. Chairman Chiang's loyalty is no less than that of ancient national heroes and sages.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang lost his father in his childhood, and Madame Wang worked hard to raise and educate him. She allowed him to study in foreign countries and permitted him to devote himself to the revolution. Chairman Chiang was exceptionally filial and able to anticipate and carry out her wishes in serving Madame Wang. He never violated her instructions, and never acted presumptuously in matters she forbade. Within the family, there was harmony and joyfulness for decades, as the villagers knew and admired. As an ancient sage said, "To seek loyal subjects, one must look to the families of filial sons." Therefore, Chairman Chiang's ability to be loyal to the country and fulfill his responsibility to save the country is also an extension of his filial piety.</p>
<p>The depravity of people's hearts and the corruption of customs have reached their peak today. Based on his inherent nature and long-standing practices, Chairman Chiang intends to use the principles of loyalty and filial piety to save people's hearts and customs, and to cultivate the nation's vitality. This is truly prescribing the right medicine for the disease, something that ordinary politicians cannot aspire to. What we sincerely pray for is that Chairman Chiang's great strategy for saving the country will be widely implemented throughout the world and achieve complete success. By saving the country to prolong the country's life, Chairman Chiang's great personality will also last as long as the country. This is what I, Peng, want to say. Yu Feipeng, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications</p>
<h3>A Collection of Chairman Chiang's Recent Two Years of Words and Deeds</h3>
<p>— Tao Guoren</p>
<p>This month, on the 31st, we respectfully celebrate Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. People from all walks of life joyfully offer their congratulations. However, Chairman Chiang insisted on humility and was unwilling to burden the people with expenses for his personal birthday. Therefore, he issued instructions that, in addition to congratulatory messages, no gifts should be accepted (all birthday plaques, scrolls, etc. received by the Military Commission in recent days have been returned to the senders). However, the act of purchasing aircraft to celebrate his birthday expresses the sincerity of supporting the leader and increases the country's ability to resist aggression, truly an unprecedented event. Recalling that Chairman Chiang worries about national affairs and has no time to rest, especially in recent years, feeling the devastation of the Communist bandits internally and the encroachment of friendly nations externally, he often goes to various places to personally give instructions. Therefore, his usual wise words and exemplary actions are abundant. Thus, I respectfully compile this brief collection to provide the people of the country, in this time of national crisis, with a deep recollection of the leader's virtue and hard work.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Deal with the Current Food Problem</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the new crops of soybeans, wheat, rice, and grains came onto the market this year, prices have been rising continuously, attracting attention from all quarters. Some argue that the reason for the price increase is due to banks investing in rural areas, undertaking grain mortgage loans, and the development of agricultural warehouses in various provinces, leading to large stockpiles. Furthermore, many farmers, having had a good harvest, are hoarding surplus grain to sell at a higher price, or are worried about drought and disaster, and are scrambling to store up reserves, resulting in soaring grain prices. If this is indeed the case, it is a welcome phenomenon. For if there is truly a bumper harvest, accumulating surplus grain to guard against famine years is an excellent practice. Moreover, if prices rise due to stockpiling, and rise to the point of harming the people's current food supply, the stockpiling will inevitably stop, or they will even release their stored grain to stabilize prices. This not only does not hinder the people's food supply, but also has the benefit of regulation. Therefore, the temporary rise in grain prices is not a cause for great concern. However, if the purpose of stockpiling is for other reasons, such as hoarding for profit or using it for manipulation, with extravagant hopes of profiting, then the higher the grain price, the firmer their determination to hoard. Even if the market reports a grain shortage and people are struggling to find food, it would be impossible to move the minds of such people. If the reason for the soaring prices lies here, then it is truly a cause for concern and requires alternative effective measures. As for farmers thinking of selling at a higher price due to a surplus from a good harvest, or thinking of stockpiling grain to prevent hunger due to the increasing autumn drought, given the current economic capacity of the average farmer, they would be an absolute minority. Even if they do hoard, the quantity would be very small and unlikely to be the main cause of rising grain prices.</p>
<p>During the meeting of the eight provinces and cities on food issues, the Shanghai representative proposed establishing a grain transportation and sales bureau to regulate the people's food supply and stabilize grain prices. Preparations were eventually moved to the Ministry of Finance due to the large sums of money and the magnitude of the undertaking. Recently, the government also discussed issues such as establishing a food authority and banning food exports, with talks of immediately convening meetings of relevant ministries and commissions. The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang also believe that the recent rise in grain prices is partly due to grain merchants smuggling grain, and have taken measures to strictly prohibit food exports. The Shanghai grain industry believes that this matter obstructs circulation and hinders the people's food supply in Shanghai, and is calling for the ban to be lifted. All of these are direct consequences of the rising grain prices.</p>
<p>There are many ways to address the issue of the people's food supply; how could this short commentary cover them all? In short, the rise in grain prices today is like "when Copper Mountain collapses in the east, the Luoyang bell rings in the west." Grain prices in production and sales areas rise in response to each other, so it is not a matter of one place rising while another place falls, requiring transportation and sales for adjustment. Therefore, while transportation and sales are an important aspect of resolving the people's food supply, they are not the most urgent task at present. If, on the one hand, we are talking about transportation and sales, emphasizing circulation, and on the other hand, we are restricting exports, what is the meaning of this? It is important to understand that the crux of the problem today does not seem to lie in banning exports. In recent years, rice and grain have been continuously transported to the north, which we have long considered a cause for concern. As the saying goes, "The benefit of using troops lies in taking from the people and feeding on the enemy," so that there is no worry of "distant transport impoverishing the army" (see this newspaper's current commentary on March 11). Therefore, even if a ban is implemented, can we be certain that the other party will not resort to the old trick of smuggling? Moreover, with China's doors wide open and smuggling still prevalent, can we be even more certain that after reaching the shore, it will not be transshipped elsewhere? Even if there are no such concerns and we resolutely implement the ban, it must be a nationwide ban on exports, with prevention also on land routes, before it can be effective. Otherwise, smuggling will still be unstoppable. If we implement inspections of grain crossing borders, then we worry about harassing merchants. Restricting circulation between provinces not only opens the door to obstruction but also risks losing the benefits of regulation if others follow suit. Moreover, with adjacent lands forming interlocking patterns, and provinces separated by a single stream, the borders between them are like those between disparate regions. Although it does not amount to cutting off grain supplies, the inconvenience is already enough to hinder the circulation of food.</p>
<p>For the current situation, besides the transportation and sales and stockpiling of grain, which should be discussed separately, I believe we should pay attention to the following points: (1) The current Baojia system is being vigorously promoted, making it easy to complete the survey of food production in a short period of time. On the other hand, by surveying the quantity sold at the collection and distribution ports of food, we can obtain more accurate figures on food production and sales, which can be used as a basis for regulation. (2) How to reduce the control of external forces over the grain market and how to practically manage it to prevent manipulation by speculators should be planned and implemented immediately. (3) Public stockpiling should be implemented to prevent merchants from hoarding for profit while encouraging stockpiling. (4) Food management agencies should be established at food collection and distribution ports. These agencies should not be composed of various parties but must have dedicated personnel responsible for managing all food-related matters in cooperation with officials and merchants. (5) If, at present, it is believed that grain prices are already high and should be slightly restrained, then please ask the banking sector to temporarily refrain from making various promotions for investing in rural areas and stockpiling grain to reassure speculators and national households, and temporarily stop buying to ease market tension. As for the extent of the bumper harvest, whether there is a surplus or still a shortage, we must formulate a comprehensive plan. We should not be overly cautious or take things too lightly but should prioritize the public welfare and seek solutions based on facts.</p>
<h3>UEDA Kenkichi Meets NAMI Jirō, Discusses Manchukuo-Korea Cooperation, Strengthening Security, and Developing Resources</h3>
<p>Seoul - The Governor-General of South Korea and his party departed Unggi at 8:00 AM on the 29th, traveled along the banks of the Tumen River, and arrived in Tumen at 4:25 PM. They dined with Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army at the consular branch office and held important discussions from 5:00 PM until 7:30 PM, resuming the discussions at 8:00 PM and concluding at 10:40 PM. (Kyodo Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Tumen - When the two generals, NAMI and Ueda, met with the press corps, Governor-General NAMI stated to the reporters regarding the content of the meeting: "Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army and I happened to be conducting our initial inspections at the same time, separated only by the border. We considered this a good opportunity, so we held a meeting. The content of the discussions cannot be disclosed at this time. In essence, we fully discussed the inseparable economic relationship and the issue of strengthening security based on the principle of Manchukuo-Korea unity." After further discussions from 8:00 PM, the two generals issued a joint statement, stating: "Governor-General NAMI of South Korea is inspecting North Korea, and Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army is simultaneously inspecting the JianDao area. Both sides considered this a good opportunity and thus held a meeting. Governor-General NAMI obtained the Emperor's approval and arrived in Tumen at 4:00 PM on the 29th, where he met with Commander Ueda at the consular branch office. Both sides believe that this will greatly benefit the future relationship between Korea and Manchukuo. The accompanying generals also held thorough discussions on matters under their respective jurisdictions." (Kyodo Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>British Government Resolves to Strictly Curtail Fascist Activities</h3>
<p>(London) - Home Secretary Lloyd declared in the House of Commons today that the British government will make every effort to prohibit Fascism and anti-Semitism. The "mischievous actions" of the London Fascists must be prohibited. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Government Forces Launch Counteroffensive, Madrid's Situation Stabilizes, Using Tanks and Aircraft in Combat, Three Towns South of the Capital Recovered</h3>
<p>Madrid - According to government announcements, government forces have achieved significant victories after launching a major counteroffensive in the southern and southeastern sectors of the Madrid front. Government forces have recaptured the three towns of Torrejón de Velasco, La Guardia, and Ciempozuelos. The Nationalist Revolutionary Army had been preparing to launch a final offensive on the capital from these three towns. In addition, government forces have completely controlled the railway line between Madrid and Aranjuez and are currently advancing towards Illescas, located 25 miles from the capital. A military bulletin detailing the campaign stated that government forces had made great progress on the southern front as a result of the counteroffensive, forcing the Nationalist Revolutionary Army to transfer infantry, artillery units, and Moroccan cavalry reinforcements from other fronts. In the past three days, government aircraft have shot down thirty Nationalist Revolutionary Army aircraft on the northern, northwestern, and southwestern fronts. Although Madrid has not announced definitive news, the atmosphere in the city seems to be gradually calming down. Prime Minister Caballero has issued a startling official statement, stating that the militia is now prepared to advance safely because they have tanks and ample munitions, and that they will remove the danger from the capital within 24 hours. It is reported that the rebels were caught off guard by the militia's sudden and courageous offensive with tanks, aircraft, and armored trains and were forced to retreat. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The capital city today received its first reports of government forces' victories, and the residents were greatly excited. Furthermore, Prime Minister Caballero's proclamation to the people this morning, expressing the government's determination to resist, received a good impression. Political figures compared today's victory of the government forces to the Battle of the Marne in the European War (Note: In 1915, when the German army pressed on Paris, the French commander Joffre led his troops to resist and defeated the German army at the Marne River, turning the crisis into safety. This was a famous battle in the European War). Today, an armored train also went to the small village of Getafe. In addition, the government forces had secretly prepared several armored trains a few days ago, which were used in the recent fierce attacks on the railway line leading to Ciempozuelos, Alcorcón, and Aranjuez. Government forces are not only launching offensives on the central front but are also reportedly planning to change to offensive operations on other fronts. The concern of the residents of the capital regarding the development of the civil war has now reached its highest point. Wounded soldiers can be seen walking along the streets of the city, most of whom have suffered foot injuries from machine gun bullets and hand grenades. This morning, several government aircraft scattered declarations in the sky over the capital, advising the residents of the capital to join the official army to participate in the great battle to defend the capital. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Expresses Determination to Resist, Issues Proclamation to the People</h3>
<p>Madrid - Prime Minister Caballero issued a proclamation to the people, expressing the government's determination to resist. It was delivered to the troops on the central front this morning, and the commanders gathered the soldiers to read it aloud in public. The text stated: "Since the Fascist traitors marched on the capital, their combat power has been declining day by day, becoming an arrow at the end of its flight. On the government side, the unity is increasing, and powerful mechanized military equipment has been put in place, including tanks and aircraft, without exception. We should take the opportunity to severely wound the traitors. All my comrades, listen to me: at dawn today, our artillery and armored trains will fire first, and the air force will strafe with machine guns. Then, the tank troops will advance and attack the weakest points of the rebel positions. Then, all the soldiers will jump forward, attack the enemy fiercely, and annihilate them. The traitors who lead a small number of troops to their deaths will be punished by public opinion, and our wives and sisters will be rescued from now on. All my comrades, move forward!" After hearing this declaration, the government forces were inspired and launched a major offensive amid shouts of "Never let the traitors pass," successively overcoming the three key towns of Vallecas, Torrejón de Velasco, La Guardia, and Ciempozuelos south of the capital and are now continuing to advance in the direction of Illescas. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Rebels Propagate Russian Troops Participating in the War</h3>
<p>Lisbon - The headquarters of General Varela, commander of the Spanish Nationalist Army, issued a public announcement this morning stating that among the government soldiers captured in the fighting near Madrid yesterday, there were more than 300 Russian soldiers who had recently arrived from Soviet Russia and could not understand a single Spanish word. The announcement also stated that, according to captured government officers, there is now a Soviet Russian general commanding the government forces, concentrating all the troops in the southwest of Madrid, leaving only a very weak outpost force to guard the Guadarrama front. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Government Forces Achieve Victory in Offensive on the Northeastern Front, Occupy Huesca</h3>
<p>Barcelona - The Catalan Autonomous Government recently announced that government forces entered Huesca yesterday, occupying the lunatic asylum, slaughterhouse, and several large buildings in the city held by the rebels. In addition, government forces also recaptured the two towns of Bumbi and Espa-Pompiros on the Aragon front and occupied part of the city of Jaca. (Havas Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>Continuous Heavy Rain Obstructs Rebel Advance</h3>
<p>Rabat, Morocco - According to a broadcast from the Nationalist Army radio station in the Taza region of Spanish Morocco, continuous heavy rain has delayed the advance of the Nationalist Army columns on Madrid considerably, but there may be more significant news tomorrow. At the same time, the Nationalist Army radio station in Córdoba broadcast an order from Nationalist leader General Franco, ordering all reserve troops to report within five days. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Talavera de la Reina - A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that the Nationalist Army expects Madrid to fall in early next week. At that time, the Moroccan indigenous troops will be the first to enter the city from the southwest, occupying the key points of the city center, such as the government offices, radio station, and post office. Then, the tank troops will enter the city, followed slowly by the Moroccan regular army and foreign troops to prevent ambushes. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Rome Denies Bombarding Spanish Coast</h3>
<p>(Rome) - The authorities today formally denied the Spanish government's accusation that Italian warships had bombarded the Catalan coast. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>No Naval Battle Occurred in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>(London) - There were reports of loud cannon fire in the Strait of Gibraltar between Ceuta in Spanish Morocco and Algeciras in Spain, and it was widely believed that it was a fierce battle between warships of the Spanish government forces and the Nationalist Army in the Strait. It is now learned that the cannon fire was due to artillery practice by the Gibraltar forces today. The Gibraltar authorities have formally stated that no naval warfare occurred in the Strait yesterday or today. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>Britain Maintains Neutrality on the Spanish Civil War, Prevents the Spread of War to All of Europe, Eden's Speech Favors Portugal and Opposes Russia</h3>
<p>(London) - During the debate in the House of Commons today on the international situation arising from the Spanish Civil War, Foreign Secretary Eden emphatically stated that the British government would continue to adhere to its policy of non-interference in Spanish affairs, otherwise the situation would inevitably become chaotic, leading to international mutual accusations or perhaps even promoting war. Eden said that this policy has been supported by the majority of the British people. The British people deeply regret the mutual strife and arbitrary killings of the two Spanish parties but believe that the main responsibility of their government is to prevent the spread of the war from the unfortunate country to other countries.</p>
<p>When the House of Commons convened today, the seats for members and the public galleries were full. Many foreign ambassadors and ministers were also present. Prime Minister Baldwin attended the House of Commons for the first time after his illness, his face slightly pale, but he was in good spirits when he finished his speech at the end of the debate.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Eden detailed the various events before the conclusion of the non-interference agreement, analyzed the effects of the agreement on the two sides, and responded to the accusations regarding the implementation of the agreement. Eden denied rumors that the French government initiated the agreement under pressure from the British government, saying that the French government itself initiated this move. The British government believes that this move is of great help to the peace of Europe. Now, is there anyone who denies that the non-interference policy is the policy that best maintains the peace of Europe? The only point that the House of Commons needs to discuss is this. He knows that the general public believes that the implementation of the agreement is aimed at resisting the Spanish government, and some even say that the agreement has determined the course of the Spanish Civil War. Eden then refuted in detail to prove the fallacy of the various statements, saying that the intention of those who advocated these statements was that without this agreement, the Spanish government could obtain a large amount of foreign arms supplies and eliminate its original disadvantages. Furthermore, before the establishment of the agreement, there was no dispute everywhere, but the Nationalist Army received large amounts of arms supplies from more than one source. The total source of arms supplies for each side was the five countries of Italy, Germany, France, Russia, and Britain. Russia, Italy, and Germany had been manufacturing large quantities of weapons for a long time, making it easy to assist one side they supported with weapons quickly. However, Italy is in an excellent geographical location, so its supply of weapons is more convenient than Russia. As for Britain, due to the needs of its defense procedures, even without the non-interference agreement, the arms that Britain could supply to Spain would not have a significant impact on the outcome of the war. He cannot speak for France, but in the current tense European situation, it is difficult to imagine the difficulty of asking France to supply a large amount of arms. Therefore, he would like to ask the members who believe that the implementation of the non-interference agreement is completely unfavorable to the Spanish government to reconsider this matter and contemplate the debate he has just made. The Foreign Secretary continued to mention the implementation of the agreement and the International Committee, saying that the British government had done its best to make the committee effective and expedite all discussions. The British representative even proposed a proposal to monitor the land and sea entry points of Spain at yesterday's meeting of the committee. The Foreign Secretary then criticized Russia's attitude towards Portugal, saying that the British government had never supported Russia's proposal to monitor Portuguese ports. Now, in fairness, the various information received by the British government has not proven that Portugal has violated the non-interference agreement.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then informed the House of Commons that the British government will continue to maintain close contact with the French government, hoping to jointly decide everything because both democratic governments bear important responsibilities. Eden then praised the British Navy, which had transported 6,000 refugees from Spain, including 2,000 British nationals. Many foreign governments have sent letters of thanks.</p>
<p>After the Foreign Secretary's speech, Labour Party member Greenwood and Liberal Party leader Sinclair both requested clarification of the truth about the Balearic Islands, as it was rumored that Italian troops had now taken control of the islands. Greenwood said that Gibraltar is now smiling at the Spanish Fascists and frowning at those loyal to the Spanish government. Sinclair said that the Spanish Fascist Party could not succeed without the assistance of Italy, which must have been agreed upon in advance. Sinclair advocated maintaining the non-interference agreement, saying that if France or Britain supplied one cannon to Spain, Italy and Germany could supply fifty cannons, so it is still advisable to maintain the non-interference agreement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin made a speech to end the debate, saying that both sides had inevitably violated the non-interference agreement to some extent, but its importance was not enough to make Britain revise its policy. Since the end of August, Britain has continued to promote its humanitarian efforts in Spain. The British government had exchanged hostages with the Spanish government but was rejected, so it later made this proposal to the Burgos authorities. However, the British government has been doing everything alone, and it has been quite effective. The British representative in Madrid, together with the diplomatic corps, privately asked the Spanish government to curb private feuds and place reliable guards in various prisons. Now, the Spanish authorities have given assurances that all killings will be stopped, and the beautiful results of the appeals from all parties will be immediately visible.</p>
<p>Baldwin continued, saying that as far as Britain is concerned, both the communist and fascist forces have no way to exercise their skills, and we should thank God for this. He believes that the difference between democratic and autocratic political systems lies in the fact that the former publishes all its troubles to the world, while under autocracy, we must speculate on where its troubles lie. Baldwin further said, "The British political system is relatively sound. Although there are differences of opinion between Sir Nevile Henderson and the Air Ministry, the scope is also very small. The outside world has been exaggerating and it is not the truth." Baldwin spared no effort in criticizing both communism and fascism, continuing to say that some people believe that Germany may attack Britain one day, saying that Britain's danger is not in Germany. He believes that there is no reason why the tragedy of war cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Baldwin concluded, "What we are working hard to do now is world peace." (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Opens Yesterday, Reads the King's Speech, Mentioning Foreign Affairs and Domestic Affairs</h3>
<p>(London) - After the resumption of Parliament yesterday, members of both houses gathered in the House of Lords this morning for the opening ceremony. As the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Hailsham, was on vacation, Lord Onslow, Chairman of the Joint Committee of both houses, read the speech of King Edward VIII on his behalf. The King did not attend in person, and the leaders of the opposition parties did not attend either. The King's speech stated: "I have always maintained friendly relations with all countries," and mentioned the Treaty of Alliance concluded between the British government and Egypt on August 26, stating, "The friendship between Britain and Egypt has always been profound, and cooperation has been seamless. The conclusion of this Treaty of Alliance, once approved by Parliament, will open a new era in the relationship between the two countries, and the original spirit of cooperation should be carried forward and expanded. This is what I hope for." The speech also mentioned that the Montreux Conference in July was successfully concluded, which is very fortunate.</p>

<p>Britain remains committed to the principles contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Britain is also continuing negotiations with the countries concerned on the conclusion of the New Locarno Pact. As for the Spanish Civil War, it is of the utmost concern. The country is in turmoil, and the people are suffering. The British Navy is doing its best to provide disaster relief and care for its neighbors, in accordance with tradition. The consistent policy of the British government is to strive to find ways to prevent the tragic and unfortunate dispute from spreading. When the French government took the lead in proposing the conclusion of a non-interference agreement, the British government responded and resolutely conducted negotiations with France and other countries to implement the agreement. To this end, the King reiterated the process of the establishment of the Anglo-French-American Monetary Agreement, saying that what he did was to adjust the currency prices of each country through joint action. "I firmly believe that the measures recently taken by the French government and other governments will pave the way for international trade."

<h3>British House of Commons Pays Close Attention: Future of Sino-Japanese Negotiations. Eden States the Far East Situation Can Generally Tend Toward Conciliation.</h3>
<p>Britain Insists on Not Recognizing the Puppet State</p>
<p>(London) In today's session of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Sir Michaelson asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether the government had any plans to recognize "Manchukuo." Eden replied, "The attitude adopted by the British government will continue to follow the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, 1932." (Note: That resolution stipulated that all member states of the League of Nations should not recognize "Manchukuo.") Liberal MP Mond raised several questions regarding the situation in China, to which Eden responded, "Regarding the situation in southern China, disputes arose between the central Chinese government and the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi this summer, but they were ultimately resolved satisfactorily. As for the situation in North China, there have been few significant changes, but the amount of smuggled goods imported into North China appears to have decreased significantly. Regarding the negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments in Nanjing, the British government sincerely hopes that these negotiations can lead to a general easing of tensions in the Far East."

<h3>Anti-Fascist Activities: Government Expands Propaganda.</h3>
<p>Brussels: The government is currently conducting extensive propaganda to oppose the activities of the Fascist Rexist Party. Minister of Justice Bovesse delivered a radio broadcast speech today, stating, "If we sit idly by and watch heresies spread without correcting them, people will think that we, the people of Belgium, are about to return to a state of slavery. There are those who silence people's pens and mouths while claiming to be democratic, but I am not one of them. It should be known that Rexist leader Degrelle is not a member of parliament elected by the people, and yet the Rexist members of parliament follow his lead blindly. How can this be permitted by our country's political system? If these instigations were limited to gatherings, and if their audience were only ignorant women, children, petty merchants, and rural fools, then they would have the right to do so, and the government would not want to interfere. However, if they use the name of freedom to carry out illegal riots, the government would be making a serious mistake if it permitted it. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the state organs and the legal system to oppose any violent attacks." (29th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Turkey Abolishes: Trade Agreement with Japan.</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 29th, the Turkish government notified Miyazaki, the acting ambassador stationed in Turkey, in a document dated the 28th, that it was abolishing the provisional Japan-Turkey trade agreement. Therefore, this agreement will expire on January 2nd of next year. However, the Turkish government stated that it was prepared to begin discussing the fundamental issues regarding the establishment of a new treaty with Japan. The provisional Japan-Turkey trade agreement was signed on December 22nd, Showa 9 (1934), stipulating that both countries could export goods worth up to 4 million Turkish lira with a compensatory nature.

<h3>Bishop of Hong Kong Praises Chinese Women</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong, Hall, gave a speech at the Central Women's Christian Association here yesterday, praising Chinese women highly. He stated, "Chinese women are rich in guidance and judgment ability, and they also have perseverance. I am amazed by this. China has repeatedly been forced into difficult circumstances, but the women of that country have ultimately been able to exercise great common sense to deal with it, which is truly commendable. I firmly believe that that country will occupy a very important position in the world, and its achievements will be determined by the tasks undertaken by the women of that country. Some say that if Chinese youth are too enthusiastic about Westernization, then Soviet Russia will become their spiritual leader, but that is not accurate." (30th Havas)</p>

<h3>France Expands Navy: Adds 51 New Ships: Submarines Occupy Important Position.</h3>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources recently stated that the 1937 naval construction plan proposed by Navy Minister Gasnier has been approved by the cabinet. The plan advocates the construction of 51 new ships, totaling 47,000 tons, including one 8,000-ton cruiser, two 1,850-ton destroyers, a number of 1,000-ton destroyers, three 1,500-ton submarines, two small submarines, two special submarines, 28 small gunboats, a number of submarine destroyers, four aircraft carrier transport ships, two colonial patrol aircraft, two torpedo transport ships, and one oil tanker. As for the main battleship category, there are already four ships under construction, two with 35,000 tons and two with 26,500 tons. Once they are completed, they will be sufficient for deployment, so it is not planned to add more in the next year. In addition, there are six 7,200-ton cruisers that can be completed and incorporated into the fleet, and there are also 32 2,000-ton destroyers, so it is not planned to add more. However, certain types of destroyers, which have been suspended since 1926, must be rebuilt. From the above, it is clear that submarines are still the most important category. However, considering the characteristics of the 1937 naval construction plan, the number of small ships is also relatively large, which goes without saying. Regarding this plan, the Petit Parisien newspaper recently published a commentary, saying, "This plan can be called transitional. Its purpose is to supplement the insufficient number of small ships belonging to the French fleet, and then, within a short period of time, to propose a new plan advocating the construction of two 8,000-ton cruisers and one or two aircraft carriers."

<h3>Japanese Troops in North China: Exercise Occupation of Tianjin: Red and White Armies Engaged in Several Fierce Battles: Plainclothes Units Also Participated in Combat: Dense Gunfire, Realistic Situation.</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese garrison in North China is holding a major exercise. The first section, a joint exercise of the linked regiments, began on the 26th, simultaneously in Tianjin and Beiping, and ended late on the 28th. The troops rested on the 29th. On the morning of the 30th, the second section of the regiment anti-confrontation exercise began, with Fengtai, Changxindian, and Lugouqiao, where the Beiliu Road, Pinghan Road, Ping Sui Road, and Pingjin Road cross the tracks, as the center of contention. On the morning of the 31st, fierce battles were held again at the Yongding River and Lugouqiao, with engineers building rafts and bridges and forcibly crossing the river, applying modern tactics as a large-scale field battle, which ended that evening. Japanese Commander Tadashi ordered Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Senior Staff Officer Iida, Section Chief Sentada, and other relevant staff officers to go to Tongzhou on the morning of the 2nd. A command headquarters was established in the local special affairs agency to direct the major exercise of the entire Japanese garrison in North China. The puppet Ji Army government, for the sake of driving the workforce, established a Japanese Military Exercise Support Association, which was responsible for handling all matters related to the exercise supply, led by Wang Jizhang, the puppet Tongzhou County Governor. The intentions behind the joint exercise of the Tianjin suburban linked regiment from the 26th to the 28th are extremely profound, which are described in detail below.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops participating in the Tianjin suburban exercise were divided into Red and White teams. According to the hypothetical strategy of the military headquarters' combat section, the Red Army was the main defender, and the White Army was the attacker. At the same time, it was assumed that the Red Army was us and the White Army was the Japanese, with the goal of contending for Tianjin. The units in charge of the attacking army were the Shanhaiguan, Tanggu, and Tangshan guard troops, numbering more than 800 people, linked to more than 700 special branch troops from Lü, Tang, and Qin, for a total of more than 1,500 people. The units in charge of the defending army were the troops stationed in the Tianjin Haiguang Temple and Dongjuzi barracks, numbering about 1,800 people. The remaining chemical warfare, tank, engineer, and communications squads were also separately added to both sides. The exercise began at 6:00 AM on the 26th, assuming that the White Army attacked from the sea and landed at Tanggu, intending to occupy Tianjin. The Red Army received the report and urgently mobilized a large number of troops, rushed to the suburbs of Tianjin to deploy defenses, and the two sides had an unexpected encounter battle near Junliangcheng on the Tangjin section of the Beining Road. The White Army reinforcement troops also arrived from Shanhaiguan, using chemical warfare equipment to cooperate in a fierce attack. The Red Army then changed its strategy, using a large cavalry detour, went out from Lutai in Ninghe County, and cut off the Tang Yu connection between the White Army. As a result, the White Army retreated and gathered between Tang Zhan and Xianshugou to wait for the enemy. That evening, the president of the Tianjin Japan Reservists Association, Tamura, summoned 420 reservists, linked the volunteer corps, the Ji Bei Riding Society, the National Defense Women's Association, and more than a thousand armed expatriates, organized a plainclothes team, assumed that the Red Army was the enemy, and specially disturbed the Tianjin suburbs of Dazhigu and Sunzhuang, etc., for support and defense. The White Army in the Xianshugou area also harassed the Red Army's positions with a small number of troops, resulting in skirmishes and night battles. At 7:00 AM on the 27th, the Red Army dug trenches in the Chentangzhuang, Xianshugou, and Junliangcheng areas for a long-term defense. The White Army then launched a fierce attack with tanks, armored vehicles, and field artillery, causing the Red Army to fall into a bitter battle. The White Army cavalry also detoured from Junliangcheng separately, and the reservists also succeeded in their support and defense activities. At this point, the Red Army felt the pressure of artillery fire and the rear defense was shaken, so it abandoned the Xianshugou position and retreated. On this day of the exercise, traffic within 50 miles of Xianshu was completely cut off. The density of the artillery fire was heard for dozens of miles, and the scene was realistic, almost no different from actual combat. Hashimoto, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison, led staff officers Adachi, Kai, attached officer Suzuki, and Nagamine to inspect in the morning, and gave instructions to the commander of the attacking army, Tangshan's Shinobe, and the commander of the defending army, Huangdao, the commander of the Tianjin Second Regiment. The exercise on the 28th, continued the items of the 26th and 27th from 10:00 AM, as the final decisive battle. The Red Army launched a counterattack towards Xianshugou and Junliangcheng separately, and defended Dazhigu and Dongjuzi to form a triangular position. The Japanese army advanced along the Haihe River and the Beining Road with two wings, and contacted the reservists in Tianjin, breaking the Red Army in Junliangcheng and Dazhi at once. The Red Army then retreated along the Pingjin road to Yangcun and Beicang. After that, they continued to exercise the pursuit battle. The White Army headquarters entered Tianjin, assuming cooperation with the reservists, the National Defense Women's Association, and the Volunteer Corps to search for the remaining enemies and occupy Tianjin. On the one hand, they pursued along the enemy's retreat route. After the Red Army was defeated, they collected troops in Yangcun and Beicang for the final resistance. After 9:00 PM, until 3:00 AM on the 29th, night battles took place in Yangcun and Beicang, with field artillery firing light-emitting bombs and incendiary bombs to exhaust the effectiveness of the new weapons. On the 29th, the troops from Jin, Tang, Yu, and Tang were transported to the Houtai area of Beiping. At 0:50 AM, 700 infantry and artillerymen, 50 horses, and 6 field guns were loaded on a special train and opened to Anding. At 1:30 AM, there were 70 infantrymen and 140 horses, which also opened to Anding. At 3:00 AM, 160 artillerymen, 8 heavy guns, and 5 trucks were loaded on a special train and opened to Anding. At 3:40 AM, 6 field guns, 70 artillerymen, and 16 armored vehicles were loaded on a special train and opened to Anding. At 7:00 AM, 120 Tanggu cavalrymen, 800 Tianjin infantrymen, and 4 field guns were taken by the Ping Shen second train to Anding, and the command headquarters of the Second Regiment was placed in Anding as the rear defense. From the morning of the 30th, they advanced to Fengtai and fought against the First Regiment of Beiping. The command headquarters of the brigade commander Kawabe was established at Fengtai Railway Station on the 29th. (29th)</p>

<h3>The Deployment of the Japanese Army's Large-Scale Exercise in North China: An Unprecedented Event Since the Boxer Rebellion</h3>
<p>This time, the Japanese army conducted a large-scale exercise in the vicinity of Beiping (now Beijing), Hebei Province, with over 7,000 participants. For about ten days, everything centered around Beiping. The grandeur of the military presence, the precision of the deployment, and even the participation of chemical warfare units represented an unprecedented move by foreign troops in China since the Boxer Rebellion. The foreign armies' ability to station troops in Tianjin and Beiping stemmed from the anti-foreign sentiment of the Boxer Rebellion and was stipulated in the Boxer Protocol of 1901. However, the spirit of the agreement was merely to maintain transportation between Tianjin and Beiping. Therefore, although various countries had troops stationed there, the numbers were very limited. Leisurely drills were mostly confined to the Legation Quarter and its surrounding open spaces (the open space around the Legation Quarter was not allowed to have buildings constructed, which was also recognized at the time, to meet the security needs of the legation area). During their spare time they went to the Babaoshan ball field, and annual exercises were mostly conducted near the Shanhai Pass. There was never a case of troops openly displaying their armor near Beiping. In recent years, Japan has expanded its military presence, initially using the Boxer Protocol as an excuse, and then moving forward without restraint, continuously increasing its troop numbers. Furthermore, it has taken another step by stationing troops in Fengtai and conducting exercises in the suburbs of Beiping. Although we have records of this exercise, they are often vague and lack detail, insufficient for the general public's understanding of military affairs. Here, we present the basic operational table and a simplified map of the exercise for the readers to study, hoping they can gain some insight into the situation.</p>
<p>Basic Table of Operations for the Japanese Garrison Army's Autumn Exercise</p>
<h3>Exercise Overview</h3>
<p>26th: 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM, areas west of Beiping and north of Fengtai.</p>

<h3>Suzhou: Reconstructing the Wannian Bridge with Labor and Funding</h3>
<p>Due to merchant requests, Wuxian Construction has begun reconstruction of the Wannian Bridge outside Xumen, which is the most heavily traveled bridge. The bridge will be lowered by five feet and replaced with a wooden surface. The estimated cost is 9,500 yuan, with work scheduled to begin on November 1st. However, the contractor had already dismantled the bridge surface before building a pontoon bridge, obstructing traffic. Therefore, the business community inside and outside Xumen expressed opposition, demanding that the construction bureau build a pontoon bridge first. They also suggested changing the bridge surface to reinforced concrete for a permanent solution, with the necessary funds raised by the business community. The construction bureau considered this matter to be difficult to change after reporting it to the construction department. Building a pontoon bridge would be costly due to the wide river surface. Therefore, a changed method was to set up four ferries to transport passengers and facilitate transportation. This has been resolved and construction will begin immediately, with completion expected in two months.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Young Woman Jumps from Train in Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>At 6:15 PM on the 28th, a train on the Jinxi Line, departing from Shanghai, was passing through Anting Station in the county's third district when suddenly a young woman jumped from the window in a suicide attempt. Fortunately, a passenger noticed and quickly alerted the driver to apply the brakes. The attendants then helped the woman up, seeing that her face was badly scraped and bleeding profusely, and she had also suffered internal injuries. She was later put back on the train to Suzhou for medical treatment. It is reported that the woman's name is Zai Qian, 21 years old, from Suzhou. Because her parents prevented her from pursuing further studies, she developed suicidal thoughts.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Widening Streets in Busy City Center</h3>
<p>Within Wuyi County, Dajie (Main Street), Fuzhijie (Prefecture Direct Street), Juqianjie (Bureau Front Street), and Xianhengjie (County Horizontal Street) are the busiest.

The following is an excerpt of the plan: (1) Road width: Dajie, Fuzhijie, Beihoujie (North Back Street), Juqianjie, Xianhengjie - 8 meters for the roadway, 2 meters for the sidewalk on each side. (2) Expenses: The construction expenses will be borne 40% by the government and 60% by the residents on both sides, calculated based on the average frontage. If not self-produced, then shared jointly according to the Sixth Code. (3) Engineering plan: The road surface will be paved with cobblestones, and the sidewalks will be paved with yellow bricks or cement. (4) Drains: The main drain will be improved based on the original main drain, and side drains will be added every 25 meters. (5) Bridges: The county will allocate funds from the construction expenses to rebuild them. (6) Free building permits will be allowed when demolishing houses, and demolition costs will be handled in accordance with the average profit and loss rules for urban road construction land in Jiangsu Province. It is also heard that the county government will submit the approved plan to the provincial department for review and approval before announcing the widening and starting construction.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Grain Leaving the Country</h3>
<p>This county is a center for the collection of rice and grain, and a large number of rice and grain from various places are transported to Wuxi for sale. Therefore, every time new grain enters the market, rice shops try their best to purchase goods, and warehouses are filled to capacity, causing market prices to fall. Although this year's new harvest is more abundant than in previous years, the sources from various ports are extremely scarce, and the consumption is quite good, resulting in a firm market in this city. In recent days, batches of rice and paddy have been loaded and transported out of the country, reportedly heading to Chang'an, Luoyang, Tongshan, and other places. Within these five days, 800 tons have been shipped out every day, all using train carriages. It is evident that the amount shipped out this month is quite astonishing. In addition, the market price of flour has also increased due to brisk sales. The reason for the brisk sales is attributed to the strong purchasing power of Shaanxi, Luoyang, Weinan, Tongshan, and other places. The amount of flour shipped out yesterday was over 10,000 bags, totaling five train cars. It is said that the amount within these three days is also astonishing. Upon learning of this, the County Party Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to the train station and warehouses to investigate and take measures to prevent the loading and transportation in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Changshu: The Second Departure of the Malaria Eradication Team</h3>

In just one day, the number of people seeking treatment reached 274, of whom 44 were injected with malaria treatment drugs. The situation was very crowded. It is heard that the third departure of the team is scheduled for November 3rd.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Cracking a Case of Instigating Robbery of One's Father</h3>
<p>Magistrate Ma Zhenbang of Jiangdu County, due to repeated banditry in the seventh district, ordered the security police captain to rush to investigate. It is now known that the captain led a team of 40 men to the district and apprehended Shen Shirong, a bandit who robbed Wang Guisong, a local villager, of over ten yuan in legal tender and shot Wang Guisong in the waist and head, and also injured Wang's wife, Chen. Shen confessed to being instigated by Wang Chunlin. Wang Chunlin, as well as other suspects in the case, Jiang Chengding, Gu Jiayu, and Wu Zhaoqing, were subsequently apprehended. Wang Chunlin confessed to the instigation. All of the arrested have been transferred to the county government and are awaiting legal proceedings. It is reported that three other bandits are still at large and are being investigated. The victim was afraid of retaliation from the bandits and did not dare to report the case.</p>
<h3>Section Chief Accused of Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Yao Haicong, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Jiangdu Public Security Bureau, was accused by Liu Shengya, a first-level police officer from the First Precinct, of crimes such as dereliction of duty, assault, illegal detention, and abuse of power. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Public Security Bureau sent a document and dispatched bailiff Guan Jiazhen and police officers Yang Hui and Wang Xinhua to escort the Section Chief to the Jiangdu District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, Xia Weishang, opened the court, summoned the plaintiff's witness, Xu Zhongyuan, to the court for questioning, and ordered Yao to provide two reputable shopkeepers as guarantors and a cash guarantee of 200 yuan. It is heard that because it was difficult to find a guarantor, it was changed to Inspector Meng Shiyu acting as guarantor, and the guarantee was reduced to 150 yuan. As for the details of the case, due to a misunderstanding in which the First Telephone Precinct ordered ten pieces of clothing to be sent to the bureau, Police Officer Liu was beaten eighty times on the palms of his hands, followed by several blows with a stick, and was detained for ten days.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: The Closing of the Zhejiang Provincial Private Electricity Industry Association Meeting</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the National Private Electricity Industry Association has held annual meetings in Jiaxing, Wuxing, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Xiashi. The eighth annual meeting was held at the Minghua Power Plant in Pinghu. It opened the day before yesterday (26th), with over 300 representatives from the Construction Committee, including Wu Yulin, representative of the Ministry of Communications, Zhu Chongguang, representative of the Construction Department, Lao Naixin, and representatives, members, and guests from all sectors of the Party, government, and military. Yang Yunong, Shen Sifang, Ye Yangwu, Wen Hanpo, and Han Yimin were elected to the presidium, with Shen Sifang presiding and delivering the opening address. He briefly stated that the association was established in the same year as the National Association and has been running for eight years. During these eight years, under the supervision and maintenance of the central and local competent authorities, and with the efforts of the association's colleagues, the electrical industry in Zhejiang Province has made considerable progress. Regrettably, although the central government has various good laws and regulations, such as supervision regulations, rules for dealing with electricity theft, and rules for preventing military police organs and troops from forcibly using electricity, the trend of electricity theft in various places has not subsided slightly. Military police agencies forcibly using electricity and refusing to pay are also frequently heard of. The harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees have not been completely abolished. How to ensure that central laws and regulations are effectively implemented in the future depends on the supervision of the competent authorities and the efforts of the association's colleagues. On the one hand, the industry itself should also step up its work, revitalize its business, reduce costs, and ensure continuous supply, so that users can enjoy affordable benefits. The electrical industry is the lifeline of the country and the foundation of economic construction. In this extraordinary period, it bears a heavier responsibility. Before the fall of the Northeast, the electrical industry was controlled by foreigners. Recently, they have turned their attention to North China. If our private electrical industry cannot revitalize itself, the government does not protect it, and users do not understand it, it will inevitably gradually fail, and foreigners will seize the opportunity to step in and replace it. The degree of danger is really unthinkable. Conversely, China's electrical industry currently has more than 440 companies, with a capital of over 11 million, and hundreds of thousands of employees. If our government can use its talent and resources for the benefit of the country and train them, it can become the greatest force in national defense. The various representatives then delivered speeches, and members and guests gave speeches, which will not be recorded in length. The general meeting of members continued for two days on the 27th and 28th, and closed on the 29th. This time, Shanghai national electrical appliance manufacturers such as Zhonghua, Huade, Huasheng, and Yapuer, all attended the meeting and displayed their products at the venue. Employees of the Shaoxing Daming Company also borrowed the Xinmin Theater to perform for two days to add to the festivities.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Bureau Official Embezzles and Flees</h3>
<p>Chen Wenhui, an official of the Fengqiao Public Security Bureau in Jiaxing, released a suspect, Shi Huchen, after accepting a bribe of 40 yuan, which was paid through Cao Shuping, a clerk from Hanbei Township. This caused a great uproar. The township chiefs of Hantang, Hanzhong, Hanaan, and Daqiao jointly submitted a report to the authorities. Dai Wenhao, the deputy chief of Hanzhong Township, personally requested Wang Mingyi, the director of the Fengqiao Public Security Bureau, to investigate. Wang Xianqiang, the supervisory commissioner, instructed supervisory officers Zhuo Shaosheng and Huang Bingquan to conduct a secret investigation on the spot. The case was verified, and it was also discovered that Chen had privately confiscated fines without issuing receipts in many cases. However, bureau official Chen Wenhui had already fled after committing the crime. Later, it was verified that Shi Huchen and Cao Shuping were indeed involved. Liu Hu presented the report to Commissioner Wang for review and action.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Association Submits to the Municipal Government for Assistance in Enforcing Liens</h3>
<p>Tenants Evading Rent Damage Landlords - Requesting Police Bureau Attention - The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association held a special meeting to discuss the issue of landlords' liens on tenants who owe rent and submitted a request to the Municipal Government, requesting the government to order its subordinates to assist in enforcing such rights. The original request stated: Submitted for the matter of tenants evading rent, causing landlords to suffer damage. We earnestly request that you instruct the Public Security Bureau to instruct its branches to pay attention to the legal right of lien and provide assistance in maintaining it. Recently in Shanghai, due to the poor economic situation, many tenants accumulate large amounts of rent arrears. Instead of settling them, they secretly move away with their families. In the short time available, the landlords cannot file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. If they report to the police station and request them to stop the tenant, the police often use the excuse that the matter concerns civil affairs, and even discourage the landlord from exercising the right to retain the tenant's belongings, thus facilitating the tenant's escape. As a result, the landlords suffer losses and have no way to appeal. However, Article 445 of the current Civil Code of China states that the lessor of real estate has a lien on the lessee's belongings placed on the real estate for the debts arising from the lease contract. Article 447 states that if the tenant has the right to object, he may, without petitioning the court, immediately prevent the lessee from taking away the goods subject to the lien. If the lessee leaves the leased real estate, he may also possess the goods. According to the above articles, the landlord naturally has the right to exercise his lien on tenants who secretly move away due to rent arrears. If disputes arise as a result, they must be reported to the police station for assistance in handling the matter and maintaining order. The association has repeatedly received reports from its members about the difficulties encountered, and we earnestly request that you forward them to the government for review and approval, and instruct the Public Security Bureau to instruct its branches to pay special attention to the provisions of Articles 445 and 447 of the Civil Code. In the future, when tenants secretly move away due to rent arrears and the landlord exercises his right of lien in accordance with the law, they should be given full assistance to protect their rights and avoid losses. We await your urgent orders with utmost respect. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government. We also understand that the association has separately sent letters to the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Works Department, ordering the police stations to assist (text omitted).</p>

<p>Simple Life Insurance to be Launched Next Month, Regular Seamen's Climbing Competition to be Held - The China Seamen's Club, located at Taili, Zhaojia Road, Shanghai, has been established for more than two months. Recently, following the order of the Special Party Department of the China Seamen, it has added a public welfare section. All seamen's welfare undertakings will be handled by this section. Currently, it is preparing for simple life insurance for seamen, and will also regularly hold seamen's children's party lectures and seamen's climbing competitions. In addition, the Special Party Department of the China Seamen and the China Seamen's Union have allocated funds to establish a fund management committee. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Life Insurance - The seamen's life insurance offered by the department is handled in accordance with the postal savings simple life insurance regulations. It has been negotiated and agreed with the post office that the Seamen's Savings Insurance Association will be established on the first of next month. The association will include both savings and insurance businesses, but will temporarily only offer simple life insurance, and will offer savings later.</p>
<p>Party Lecture - In order to increase the interest of seamen's children in studying party principles and practicing Mandarin speeches, the department has scheduled a party lecture competition for students of seamen's children's schools on November 12. Students from all seamen's children's schools have been notified to participate, and prizes have been solicited from various shipping companies and seamen's organizations.</p>
<p>Climbing Competition - The climbing competition is promoted by the Central Ministry of Civil Training. The department, following the orders of its superiors and considering the environment of Shanghai, has selected the Longhua Pagoda as the climbing location. Notifications have been issued and the event is scheduled to be held on November 1. At the same time, there will be an excursion. All participating seamen will gather at the department at 9:00 AM on that day and depart for the competition at 10:00 AM. There will be prizes for the top three winners.</p>
<p>Fund Management - The fund management committee of the department has, after its fourth meeting of executive members, elected Peng Bowei and thirteen others as management committee members. They will soon begin organizing the committee.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department to Hire More Chinese Doctors</h3>
<p>The SMC Health Department determined that since school medical affairs are increasingly busy, and since the new Chinese Children's School was established on Montauban Road, it is expected that 1,000 Chinese children will enroll next year, therefore the department is unable to cope with the pressure. At the beginning of the year, the Department submitted a request to the Board of Directors, seeking approval to hire one Chinese deputy medical director (including an attendant and a second-class clerk). This matter was approved in principle by the Board of Directors on February 5 of this year, but due to financial constraints, the appointment has not been implemented. Recently, the Director of the Health Department stated that the need is urgent. If the appointment is not implemented, four of the six trachoma treatment centers for schoolchildren currently being operated will have to be closed. There are barely enough personnel to meet the current needs. However, Chinese schoolchildren who suffer from trachoma account for nearly 50%, and blindness among Chinese people is mostly caused by trachoma. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to stop the treatment of trachoma. After discussion by the Health and Finance Committees, it was agreed that although the financial situation is more difficult than at the beginning of the year, the health of children and the hygiene of citizens are at stake and cannot be stopped. Therefore, the Board of Directors was requested to approve the request so that it could proceed as soon as possible. The Department is expected to make the appointment on January 1 of next year. The total cost is estimated not to exceed 7,200 yuan per year.</p>
<h3>Wang Shouyu's Home Suffers a Fire</h3>
<p>The home of Wang Shouyu, a native of Qingjiang, at No. 324 Jun'an East Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire at around 11:20 PM last night. The flames lit up the sky and threatened to spread to the neighboring Weisheng Velvet Factory. Fortunately, firefighters from various sections of Zhabei North Fire Brigade arrived with pumps and water hoses and were able to extinguish the fire. The damage amounted to over 2,000 yuan. Wang Shouyu, where the fire started, was taken to the police station for questioning and was transferred to the General Bureau for further interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Assassination Case on Jiaozhou Road: The Deceased, Kang Wenjin, Was a Notorious Bandit, Killed Due to a Dispute over Loot and Adultery; The Court Interrogated the Perpetrators Yesterday</h3>
<p>At approximately 9:50 PM on the 11th of this month, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Lane 273, Jiaozhou Road, Yanping Road, West Shanghai. A man was found with as many as fifteen or sixteen bullet wounds. When discovered by Chinese constable No. 1920, the man was already dead, and the perpetrators had fled. Therefore, it was difficult to determine the identity of the deceased. Later, the investigators from the Putuo Road Police Station searched the deceased's pockets and found several pieces of paper and train tickets. Through investigation, they learned that the deceased was named Kang Wenjin, residing at No. 940 Dongmali, Binlang Road. However,</p>
<p>How He Was Killed</p>
<p>remained unclear. Last Thursday, Chief Chinese Detective You A'gen, Detectives Li Shugui, Weng Hongxun, and Detective Chen Shanji of the Lao Zha Police Station arrested three Anhui natives, Chen Ruiting, Wu Yuyuan, and Zhang Jinchun, in Dingxiang Lane, Avenue des Soeurs, in the French Concession. A Mauser pistol and ten bullets were found on Zhang, along with a handgun and eleven bullets, and they were handed over to the First Special District Court for detention. After turning over the suspects, the police</p>
<p>Turned Over Two Guns</p>
<p>to the firearms experts for inspection. It was found that the two guns were related to the Lafei Theater robbery on April 19 and the Kang Wenjin assassination case. The detectives then launched an investigation. The results showed that Kang Wenjin, an Anhui native, was a notorious bandit from Zhenjiang. Gu Zhenrong, Niu Min, Zhao Guangzhong, and others were Kang's accomplices. Gu was a Muslim, and his aunt was also married to a Muslim. However, she had an affair with Kang, causing Gu to</p>
<p>Harbor Great Hatred for Kang</p>
<p>but he did not reveal it, so Kang and others remained on good terms. Recently, Kang, Fu, Yang, and Zhao came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang. Kang resided at the home of his fellow villager, Cai Ruhai, at No. 940 Dongmali. On October 10, Zhao Guangzhong invited Chen Ruiting, Wu Jinyuan, and Zhang Chun'an to rob Ma Liangxi's home at an address without a number on Hart Road at 8:30 PM, obtaining 45 yuan in property. This was discovered by Kang, who then wanted to</p>
<p>Share the Loot with Zhao</p>
<p>causing Zhao to also bear a grudge against Kang. Gu Zhenrong also planned to kill Kang to avenge the adultery with his aunt. Therefore, Gu and Zhao agreed with Yang Min, Cai Ruhai, Chen Ruiting, Wu Jinyuan, and Zhang Jinchun that when Kang went to Yanping Road to watch a small Anhui opera on the 11th, Gu and the other seven would falsely claim to Kang that they wanted to rob a certain place and asked Kang to</p>
<p>Go with Them</p>
<p>Kang, unaware of their plan, went along with them. At the time, Gu, Yang, and Zhao</p>
<p>Were Walking in Front</p>
<p>While Chen, Cai, Wu, and Zhang were following behind. When they reached the entrance of Lane 273 on Yanping Road, Gu and the others pulled out their guns and shot at Kang. Because Kang tried to escape, Gu and the others fired wildly, causing Kang to suffer numerous injuries and die on the spot. Gu and the others then scattered and fled. Chen Ruiting also led the detectives to the scene of the crime to demonstrate the situation at the time. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the trial. Judge Qian Hongye of the First Special Court took his seat in the Criminal Court and interrogated the suspects. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police Station</p>
<p>Clarified the Previous Events</p>
<p>and filed charges of murder and joint robbery in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 328, and Article 321, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Ma Liangxi then turned himself in, proving that Wu Jinyuan held the gun during the robbery at the scene. Then, the Western detectives proved the inspection of the gun. Upon questioning Chen Ruiting and Gu Jinchun admitted to participating in the robbery of the Ma family and the murder of Kang Wenjin. Wu Jinyuan was also at the scene, but claimed that he and the others were behind when Kang was killed and did not fire a gun. Wu Jinyuan flatly denied the charges. Judge Qian reviewed the confessions and adjourned the case for further questioning in a week.</p>
<h3>Meihua Bank Case: British Director Appears in Court, Submits List of Meihua Shareholders, Says Bao Ziwen and Others Are Directors, But Bao and Others Deny Any Connection</h3>
<p>The British-owned Meihua Bank suddenly collapsed before it had been in business for a month. After the Chinese Chairman of the Board, Gu Yubo, fled, the British directors Yelu, Menglei, and Malet filed a criminal self-complaint against the Chinese persons in charge, accusing them of fraud and breach of trust. The Chinese depositors of the bank also followed suit and filed lawsuits against Gu Yubo and others. After investigations by the First Special District Court, Gu Yubo, Liu Tongfu, and Shen Jingzhong were either wanted or the trial was suspended due to their whereabouts being unknown. Bao Ziwen and Chen Yizai, who were in custody, were each ordered to</p>
<p>Post 8,000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>And Sun Wenkui was entrusted to his lawyer Lin Shenqing for bail. Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, Qian Chengxu, Wu Chunlei, Wang Zhonglin, and others were ordered to appear for questioning. All of these details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court for a continuation of the trial. The defendants Bao, Chen, and Sun, as well as Wu Chunlei, all appeared in court in person. Zhang, Li, Wang, Qian, and Lin Kanghou were still represented by their defense lawyers. The lawyers for the British directors Yelu and others submitted the Meihua Bank's</p>
<p>Shareholder List</p>
<p>Stating that Bao and Chen were both shareholders of the bank. The list was shown to Bao and Chen in court, but they both denied it, claiming that they had never seen the list and that it was fabricated. The court then summoned the two British directors, Menglei and Yelu, and Malet, to testify one by one about the relationship between the defendants Bao and Chen and Meihua Bank. All three stated that when they dined with Gu Yubo and Li Yichou, Gu and Li said that Bao was a major Chinese shareholder and was elected as a director by the Chinese shareholders, and that Chen was a shareholder and also served as deputy manager. In fact,</p>
<p>There Were Only Two Chinese Directors</p>
<p>Gu and Li. According to British law, the quota for Chinese directors was set at two. Later, although a third seat was added for the Chinese and Bao assumed the position, it was never realized, and the bank collapsed. Therefore, Bao's qualifications as a director were never recognized by the British Consulate. Upon questioning, Bao and Chen both denied being shareholders of Meihua Bank and holding positions as directors or deputy managers. As for the photo of all the directors taken on the bank's opening day, in which Bao was included, Bao claimed that because he</p>
<p>Went to the Bank to Congratulate</p>
<p>And was talking to Li Yichou when the photo was taken, he was included in the photo. Later, the court re-examined the receipt submitted by lawyer Lin Luanqing in the past, which showed that Bao and Chen had received salaries for March. The plaintiff's agent lawyer, Wu Peng, submitted a list of Meihua employees, and the bailiffs requested by Yelu and others submitted books showing that Bao, Chen, and Sun all had deposits. Each item was shown to them, but Bao and Chen</p>
<p>Absolutely Denied</p>
<p>Holding any position, receiving any salary, and denied having any deposits in Meihua. Sun Wenkui also said that he had no deposits. Therefore, Jiang Yiping, the defense lawyer for Bao and Chen, requested that an accountant be selected to thoroughly audit the entire accounts of the bank, saying that otherwise, the inside story of this entire scam would be difficult to expose. The audit fee should be borne by Bao and Chen, who were extremely willing to do so. Judge Huang stated that the case should be investigated further and adjourned the trial for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Zhang Ronghe Not Guilty in the Hainan Road Japanese Sailor Case, Still Detained Pending Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhang Ronghe, a porridge stall vendor from Taizhou, was accused of hiding a Mauser pistol, the weapon used to murder Japanese sailor Taminato Asahiko, inside a sand box at the entrance of Lane 15, Hainan Road, North Szechuan Road, at 8:20 PM on the 23rd of last month. The incident was witnessed by a Japanese man named Horiye Tadashi, who arrested Zhang. The Hongkou Police Station filed a public prosecution against Zhang in accordance with Article 165 of the Criminal Code for destroying evidence. The case was repeatedly tried by Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court, and the defendant hired lawyer Dan Yuhua to defend him. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the announcement of the verdict. Judge Zhong Qing, together with Prosecutor Tang, took their seats in the Criminal Court at 2:15 PM and announced the verdict, stating the main text as follows: Zhang Ronghe is not guilty. The Mauser pistol is confiscated. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Police Station stated that he still needed to consider whether to appeal and requested that the defendant be detained pending the appeal. Judge Zhong then ordered that Zhang Ronghe be temporarily detained at the Police Station pending the appeal.</p>
<h3>Headmaster Accused by Female Teacher: Students Return Summons, Indecent Assault and Moral Offense Case; Attempts at Reconciliation Fail</h3>
<p>Jingming Middle School, located at the intersection of Route du Père Huc and Rue Sapey, in the French Concession, was reorganized and renamed by Lin Jun (in his thirties) from Pubo, who took over Southern Middle School this year and serves as its headmaster. The school is developing well. Lin is now being sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Shen Fuzhen, a female English teacher from Suzhou, who accuses him of indecent assault and moral offense and requests the law to investigate. According to the lawsuit, the court initially decided to summon both parties for interrogation in court by Judge Zhang Chaozu. Because both parties failed to appear, the hearing was rescheduled. On Tuesday, the 27th of this month, the plaintiff still did not appear. Only the defendant, Lin Jun, had his lawyer appear on his behalf, stating that the case was currently being settled out of court and that the defendant had received a letter from the plaintiff indicating that a settlement could be reached. The official stated that the case was subject to prosecution and could be withdrawn. If both parties reach a settlement out of court, they can immediately file a motion with the court to withdraw the case. Because both parties have not yet reached a settlement and withdrawn the complaint, Judge Zhang visited the Criminal Court 2 again yesterday afternoon to summon both parties. Neither party appeared, nor did any lawyers appear on their behalf. Chen Mo (22 years old, from Nanhui), a student from Jingming Middle School who received the plaintiff's summons on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that after receiving the summons, he</p>
<p>Delivered it to the Plaintiff</p>
<p>This time, after receiving the summons on behalf of the plaintiff, he delivered it to the Central Hotel. The plaintiff had moved her residence, so the summons could not be delivered. He requested that the summons not be sent to the school. The official stated that the plaintiff's address on the lawsuit was the school, and the court sent the summons in accordance with the law. If the plaintiff was not there, you can refuse to accept the summons, but you cannot refuse the court's delivery of the summons to the school. He scheduled a new date to summon the plaintiff and the defendant to appear in court for trial.</p>
<h3>Cruel Superstition: Dismembering an Infant</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a patrol officer in a barren field on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, discovered a discarded infant corpse. The infant, named Lü Jinchun, was about three or four years old. The four limbs had been dismembered with a knife, and the flesh and blood were blurred. He was taken to the police station and questioned. Lü confessed that because his child was not growing up, he believed people's words and dismembered the corpse, hoping that he would not have any more children to collect debts. The police considered the case to involve damage to a corpse and abandonment and handed it over to the Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Huang Zhichang Applies to the Court to Withdraw Bail for Bao Gang</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Approves Transfer to Police for Arrest</p>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang was accused by Cui Changgui, a driver from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's special affairs division, of seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua at the local court, and of hiding in the home of Zhang Qinghong, the district chief of Chuansha's Third District, and instigating a divorce. After the public prosecution was filed and repeated inquiries were made, Bao's wife filed a complaint with the Control Yuan accusing Zhang Datong of dereliction of duty and abuse of arrest. After the Control Envoy Office specially appointed Chang to investigate in Shanghai, the local court immediately added a bail of 3,000 yuan from a shop guarantor for Bao Gang, and the accomplice, tea room worker Zhang Xinkui, was detained without bail. However, Bao Gang claimed illness and did not appear for a continued hearing the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his guarantors, Huang Shun and Huang Zhichang, the owner of Mu [missing character] Hao, hired lawyer Zhou Yongding to submit a statement to the local court to withdraw the bail, claiming that Bao Gang's first absence from court after being released on bail had already raised suspicion. When they went to inspect his home in New Shou'an Lane, Ba Xian Bridge, they found that Bao Gang's family had already moved valuable items, and Bao was also not at home. Later, he was found in a house at the intersection of Chu Qiaqing Road. They reported to the police, but the police said that without official documents from the court, they could not accept the case, so they had to send someone to monitor him. They specially filed a case requesting the dispatch of police to arrest him, otherwise there was a risk of escape. After Judge Xie opened the court and questioned the matter, he immediately dispatched bailiff Cao Zi to visit Tang Shizhu at 4:00 PM, holding the document to the police station to arrest Bao and await transfer to the Special District Court for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Extorting the Manager of the Jai Alai Stadium: Yang Yiping Sentenced; Continuous Fraud Leads to One Year Imprisonment; Yang Hears the Verdict and Bows Silently Without a Word</h3>
<p>The Spanish manager of the Jai Alai Stadium on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, Asolin (transliteration), received several threatening letters last month from bandits extorting 500,000 yuan, and also specified correspondence with the Dongya Hotel and Huang Yuanliang. He immediately reported to the French police. Later, after investigation by detectives in collaboration with the Lao Zha Police Station of the Public Concession, Yang Yiping (24 years old), a native of Fujian from the Philippines, was arrested at the Dongya Hotel in the Xian Shi Company on the 30th of last month. He was taken back to the French police station and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. During the investigation, it was also found that Yang had successively impersonated Song Yuanyuan and a certain Ye, writing letters to Shanghai Mayor Wu and Nanjing Control Yuan Vice President Xu Chongzhi, seeking relief. The police legal counsel filed a public prosecution based on the charges of attempted extortion and forging documents to obtain property. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo repeatedly questioned and investigated in court, Yang only admitted to impersonating names and requesting relief from Mayor Wu and Vice President Xu, denying that he had sent letters to the Jai Alai Stadium for extortion. He was advised to conclude the debate, and the date for sentencing was set. These matters were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang attended the First Criminal Court, brought the defendant to the dock, and sentenced Yang Yiping to six months of imprisonment for continuously forging private documents sufficient to harm others, and eight months of imprisonment for attempted extortion, to be served concurrently for one year. He also explained the brief reasons for the judgment to the defendant, advising him that if he did not agree with the judgment, he could submit a statement to the court within ten days after receiving the judgment to declare an appeal. After the advice was given, the defendant was ordered to be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period. Yang heard the verdict and bowed his head silently without a word. He was immediately taken away by the bailiff and sent to the detention center for custody.</p>

<h3>Huang Weiru and Zhu Ziyun Counter-Accuse Each Other; Court Judgment; The Zhu Brothers' Medical Practice Is Believable; Huang's Lawsuit Arises from Misunderstanding and Is Not False Accusation</h3>
<p>Huang Weiru, a local resident, recently suffered from a throat ailment and went to the clinic of throat specialist Zhu Ziyun to get a number for treatment. Unexpectedly, the person providing the consultation at that time was not Zhu himself. Huang believed that he had come to the clinic because of his reputation, but Zhu was using someone else to practice medicine under his name, which was deceitful. Therefore, afterwards, he accused Zhu of fraud and breach of trust at the First Special District Local Court, requesting that Zhu Ziyun be summoned and punished according to Articles 339 and 342 of the Criminal Law. After being accused, Zhu hired lawyer Lu Qi to defend himself and filed a counterclaim against Huang. Judge Chuan Lin had already</p>
<p>summoned both parties</p>
<p>for interrogation and declared Zhu and Huang not guilty. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Now, the judgment of this case has been delivered to both parties yesterday. The reasons for the judgment are described in two parts, self-accusation and counterclaim. The self-accusation part states that the facts of a crime should be determined by evidence. The plaintiff in this case claims that the defendant, Zhu Ziyun, practices medicine in Xian Hu Alley, Zhoujiazui Road. On October 8 of this year, the plaintiff, suffering from a throat illness, knew that the defendant was a throat specialist. On that day, in the early morning, he specially went to register and paid</p>
<p>a special registration</p>
<p>fee of two yuan and forty cents for treatment. However, the doctor was not the defendant himself. It was Luo who used his name as a slogan and replaced him with a person with no experience to diagnose, in order to defraud patients of money, which is fraud and breach of trust. He requested that the defendant be punished according to the law and presented two pieces of film hanging with the sign of Zhu Ziyun's medical residence as evidence in court. During the interrogation of the defendant, he claimed that his medical residence was jointly run by him and his brother Zhu Zhongyun, and Zhu Zhongyun was also a doctor with</p>
<p>a National Medical Association</p>
<p>membership certificate and a health bureau license as proof. He also submitted many old prescriptions returned by patients. After reviewing the prescriptions, there were the words "Zhu Brothers' Clinic Stationery". It is credible that the defendant claimed that the brothers practiced medicine together. The film submitted by the plaintiff, the sign of Zhu Ziyun's medical residence, was attached to the side of the China-Upper Pond Pharmacy signboard, not the sign hanging at the defendant's door. It cannot be simply assumed that the defendant has a false name calling for</p>
<p>defrauding patients</p>
<p>of money based on this film alone. Moreover, the evidence presented by the defendant confirms that he and his brother practice medicine together. Even if the defendant himself did not come out for treatment on the day the plaintiff sought medical treatment, he cannot be said to have violated good faith. The counterclaim part states that the crime of false accusation requires the intention to subject another person to criminal or disciplinary punishment by fabricating facts as its constituent element. The counterclaimant in this case did not personally</p>
<p>receive medical treatment from the brothers</p>
<p>of the defendant in the counterclaim, as admitted by the defendant in the counterclaim himself. Although the counterclaimant is</p>
<p>practicing medicine with his brothers</p>
<p>, the counterclaimant suspected that the medical residence was solely established by the defendant in the counterclaim because there was a sign of Zhu Ziyun's medical residence next to the signboard of the China-Upper Pond Pharmacy. Because he believed in the medical skills of the counterclaimant, he registered for treatment but did not see the person he wanted to see in his heart, accusing him of calling for an empty name and defrauding patients of money. This kind of behavior clearly arises from misunderstanding. It is difficult to simply regard it as having constituted the elements of the crime of false accusation. In summary, based on Articles 293, Paragraph 1, 332, and 335 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is made according to the main text.</p>
<h3>Unable to Afford a Wedding, A Car is Used for a Kidnapping Wedding</h3>
<p>Jiang Qinghua, a native of Gaoyou, 23 years old, who lives in a bungalow without a number in Yangshupu, works as a worker in the Dongyang Cotton Mill on the same road. Six years ago, he was engaged to Han Jinlin (19 years old), a girl from the same village. Her father, Han Ronggen, works in the Tongxing Cotton Mill and lives at No. 10 Yuezhou Road. Jiang Qinghua's mother died of illness a month ago. Later, he asked a matchmaker to ask the girl's father to choose an auspicious day for the wedding, because Han Ronggen wanted a betrothal gift of 240 yuan and 17 pieces of clothing before he would agree to the marriage. Unable to resolve the matter, at 7:30 PM on the 19th, he hired a car with his elder brother Jiang Yanyuan and cousin Zhu Jiangshi and drove to Han's house. While the girl's father, Ronggen, and elder brother, Baofu, were still working at the Tongchang Cotton Mill and had not returned home, they dragged the girl out of the bedroom, pulled her into the car (commonly known as a kidnapping wedding), and drove her back to his home, forcing her to worship heaven and earth. Later, Zhu Jiangshi took off the girl's pants and hid them on the bed, preventing her from taking a single step beyond the bed. Waiting for the girl's father to react aggressively, the girl could not escape and cried bitterly on the bed. Han Ronggen and his son returned home from the factory and learned the whole story from the second landlord, Xin Linfa, a native of Ningbo. They reported to the Huishan Police Station. Detectives Sun Aizhong and Shen Binkui secretly went to the address and arrested Jiang Qinghua, Jiang Qiyuan, and Zhu Jiangshi. They put the girl in her lower clothes and took them all to the police station. The girl was taken back by her father, and Jiang Qinghua, his brother, and Zhu were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court and questioned by Judge Xiao Xiefen at the Third Criminal Court. The girl said that she had to be welcomed with a sedan chair, and her father, Han Ronggen, also demanded a supplementary betrothal gift of 200 yuan and to be carried in a sedan chair. After Judge Xiao advised both parties, he sentenced Jiang Qinghua, Jiang Qiyuan, and Zhu Jiangshi to one month of imprisonment each, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Two Reporters Whose Footprints Cover the World Arrive in Shanghai; Hillersen Replaces the Capital's Construction; Lies Mussan Meets Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The "Chinese-language News" reports that two famous Danish journalists have met in Shanghai. Soon, each will represent the newspaper they serve and enter the Chinese mainland along different long journeys. Although the world is big, one person considers it small. These two people's footprints cover the earth. One has been collecting news for 25 years. The two recently met in Abyssinia and are now meeting again in China. Soon, they will part ways again and each pursue their careers. Unless the world experiences a major war or major event, it is not known when they</p>
<p>will be able to reunite</p>
<p>again. One of these two people is Mr. Hillersen. For the past 25 years, he has been a reporter for the Copenhagen Berlingske Tidende whenever a major event occurred in the world. The other is Mr. Lies Mussan. Although he has only been in the journalism industry for ten years, he has been a special correspondent for the Politiken newspaper whenever a major event occurred on three continents. He plans to fly to Sichuan next week, then take a boat to Yichang, decide to fly to Hankou again, and then take a train to Guangzhou. Mr. Hill's</p>
<p>anecdotes are numerous</p>
<p>In 1911, the Louvre Museum in Paris lost a famous painting. Mr. Hill happened to be returning to Copenhagen. The local officials made a bold statement, saying that the Copenhagen National Art Museum would never experience such a theft. So, Mr. Hill entered the museum and secretly took a huge famous painting and left, hiding it for twelve hours. For a time, the police and law enforcement agencies were panicked. Mr. Hill has circled the world three times. This is his third time coming to the Far East. The last time was in 1928 to 1929,</p>
<p>residing in Inner Mongolia</p>
<p>for over a year, and later making shorter stays in Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing. At that time, Nanjing had just become the new capital, and everything was still simple. Mr. Hill recently visited Nanjing again and saw that its appearance had been completely renewed, and he praised it endlessly. Since the Balkan War, Mr. Hill has participated in almost every war. His ability to explore news is outstanding, so Danish newspaper readers all regard Mr. Hill as a standout among war correspondents. During the recent Italo-Ethiopian War, Mr. Hill stayed in Ethiopia for two and a half months, while Mr. Lies</p>
<p>watched the war for five months</p>
<p>Mr. Hill then went from Ethiopia to Egypt, because the country was experiencing political turmoil at the time, and then returned to Copenhagen to spend the summer. This time, he came to China via the Suez Canal and will return to his country in the autumn of next year. Whenever Mr. Hill goes to a country, he visits its head of state and political figures. While in China, he will visit Chairman Chiang and other officials. Mr. Lies,</p>
<p>initially in Paris</p>
<p>served as a reporter for the Politiken newspaper for two years, then as a news editor, and then as a special correspondent for the newspaper in Europe, South America, North Africa, Greenland, and Iceland. During the Sino-Russian War, he accompanied the King of Abyssinia to Taixi and almost met with disaster. This time, he came to China from Denmark with his wife, passing through Abyssinia, Manchuria, Jehol, and Zhangjiakou. After that, he came to Shanghai from North China. When he goes to the mainland next week, his wife plans to stay in Shanghai. The couple is scheduled to return to their country in February of next year. Mr. Hill plans to linger in Shanghai for a while before entering the mainland again.</p>
<h3>Minhang Ferry Overturns; More Male and Female Bodies Retrieved; Total of Fourteen; Public Organizations Discuss Aftermath</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, the Luo A'gou ferry in Minhang Town, South Shanghai, overturned in Peimian due to wind. In addition to the 16 men and women rescued on the spot, including He Qingtian, Li Yousheng, Yuan A'fa from Zhugang Township, He Chunquan, Ding Yousheng from Dingqiao Township, and the boat owner Luo A'gou Jiang Chunquan, there were more than 20 other passengers who were not rescued and drowned tragically. Later, Zhang Jingqing, the district chief of the First District of the town's water public security, and Wang Xingyuan, the captain of the special task force, supervised the patrol boats and hired more than ten temporary net boats to work with the water police to retrieve the bodies of Li Yishou, Zhu Yunpu, Wang Ziqing, Pan A'bao, Li Jinru, He A'tu, He Xiangeng, Wang Guansheng, Wang Wangshi, and other nine men and women from the Huangpu River. The family members took them back with a written guarantee for burial. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. Later, because the tide of the Peijiang River rose sharply for a while, it was not easy to salvage. Until the day before yesterday, the drowned bodies floated to the surface of the river. Fourteen more men and women were recovered, including Zhao Yousheng, 59 years old, residing in Chen Chunxiang's household, 1st Bao 1st Jia 7th household, Ruan Jincai, 32 years old, residing in 1st Bao 5th Jia 1st household, Li Jingen, 25 years old, residing in 1st Bao 6th Jia 7th household, Li Guoqing, 5 years old (Li Jingen's son), Li Zhushi, 31 years old, residing in 1st Bao 6th Jia 8th household, Zhang Jinsong, 45 years old, residing in 1st Bao 8th Jia 9th household, Lu Botian, Zhu Jihai, ages unknown, residing in 2nd Bao, He Kunsheng, 27 years old, residing in 3rd Bao 4th Jia 1st household. The above ten bodies were all from Zhugang Township. Ma Jinsheng, 18 years old, residing in 5th Bao, Fei Sihai, 34 years old, residing in 4th Bao. The above two bodies were from Dingqiao Township. Wang Jialu, 31 years old, residing in Xiaotang, Liu Qianshi, 24 years old, residing in Wujiaqiao. The above two bodies were from Dongtai. All of them have been claimed by their families for burial.

A family of three generations, grandfather, father and son, died unnaturally. It is now reported that local public organizations are gathering to discuss the aftermath and to provide compensation to the families of the deceased. The boat owners Luo A'gou and Jiang Chunquan have been requested by the families of the deceased to be handed over to the Fengxian County court for legal action.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in This Port Overnight</h3>
<p>In recent days, the weather in this port has been very warm, with the Fahrenheit thermometer rising to around 80 degrees. However, in the past two nights, heavy fog has risen.

According to general predictions, the weather will change soon, either wind or rain.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Letter to the Municipal Council to Stop Water Cuts</h3>
<p>Why Not Notify of Increased Deposits? Company Responsible for Dangers</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayer Association of the Public Concession yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating, "Dear Sirs, we have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Yangzhou, which states, 'We have learned from our Standing Committee member, Mr. Li Zhixi, that I have a house at No. 11, Lane 62, Jishan Lane, Songpan Road, East District, Yangshupu, six shops at the entrance of Lane 55, opposite this lane, No. 47, and a house at No. 16, Xiuren Fang, Zhoujiapai Road, totaling more than forty rooms, with more than three hundred tenants inside. For decades, we have used the Shanghai Waterworks Company's water and have never owed fees. On the morning of the 26th of this month, the company suddenly cut off the drinking water to the above three places. Initially, we thought it was because the water bill for this month had not been paid, and we immediately sent the fee and asked them to quickly reconnect the line. However, the company replied that this cut was not for overdue fees. If we want to continue using water, we need to add a deposit of 160 yuan for all three places. I then investigated the neighboring Kuoyu Lane, Jingsui Lane, Songmao Fang, and Mingde Lane. The deposits for each household are still the same. I don't know why they are increasing only for my place. Moreover, the company did not send a single piece of paper to inform us beforehand and immediately took such resolute measures, which seems to be disallowed even by legal persons. Moreover, water and fire are essential for people and cannot be without them for a day. Cutting off people's drinking water is tantamount to cutting off people's lives. Now, more than three hundred tenants are pressing us and there is no end to the blaming. I have no choice but to hire workers to carry water for supply, temporarily avoiding a disturbance. However, the matter concerns the safety of more than three hundred people, and we are forced to ask the association to convey this to the Chinese Taxpayer Association and ask it to strictly prohibit the company and order it to restore the water to its original state immediately. If the company delays again and dangers or other accidents occur as a result, and all losses this time, the company must be fully responsible. As for increasing the deposit, we will follow the public's decision and not hold dissenting opinions, etc.' The association believes that increasing the deposit is a whole plan of the company and should not be directed at individuals, and it is another issue. Since there was no prior notification, how can it be justified to cut off people's drinking water? Such oppressive behavior is truly beyond the norm of the commercial market. Your association is the guarantor for Chinese taxpayers, so we specially and solemnly ask you to uphold justice and strictly order the company to release the water immediately to avoid accidents, etc. We hope so." The association believes that the waterworks company did not notify in advance about increasing the deposit and then immediately used resolute measures to cut off people's drinking water, causing the lives of more than three hundred citizens to be hindered. This method is not only inconsistent with commercial norms but also sufficient to affect social order. In addition to reserving all claims for compensation for losses caused by the water cut, we are specially writing to request your bureau to quickly and strictly order the waterworks company to immediately release the water to avoid serious accidents. We hope so. To the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, Shanghai Municipal</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Show at the Garden</h3>
<p>The chrysanthemums at the Garden are renowned in the city. During this clear and refreshing autumn season, those with a love for chrysanthemums like Tao Yuanming flock to admire them.

This year, there was little rain in the summer and early autumn, which was unfavorable. Without the art of growing chrysanthemums, it would be difficult to achieve this state. Moreover, the Garden's staff is very attentive. If there are any questions about cultivation, they will explain them in detail, leaving no doubts. This kind of sincerity in welcoming visitors and spirit of service is truly admirable. In addition, the Garden has been ordered to merge with the Agricultural Experiment Field and the original botanical garden of the Education Bureau from October, reorganizing into the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Field. In the future, the scale will be even larger.</p>

<p>Resolution of the Osram Trademark Dispute   The German firm Osram Trading Company in this city originally used the "Osram Trading Company" as the trademark for Osram light bulbs. Later, the Huiming Factory used the four characters "Osram Brand" on the batteries produced by the factory. The Osram Trading Company, considering that it had not given its consent and the unauthorized use of the same name would easily cause confusion to the outside world, requested the Trademark Bureau to prohibit other companies from using the "Osram" trademark. The trademark of the Huiming Factory was cancelled, but the factory refused to accept this, arguing that the Osram Trading Company had not registered the trademark and petitioned the Trademark Bureau to review the case. The Osram Trading Company argued that since its company name had not been permitted, no one should be allowed to use it, and registration was irrelevant. The Trademark Bureau handled the matter impartially and ordered the Huiming Factory not to use the "Osram" name anymore.</p>

<h3>School and Social Education Institutions   Teachers and Staff Should Pay Income Tax   Elementary School Teachers and Staff Are Exempted   The Jiangsu Education Department Specifically Notifies All Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, regarding whether the income tax of school teachers and staff should be collected at the same time as civil servants, and whether staff of county-level social education institutions can be exempted, has not been clearly stipulated.

<h3>General Overview of National Education (3)</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>(Lecture at the Vocational Guidance Class of Specialized Schools)</p>
<p>Universities and independent colleges aim to study advanced knowledge and cultivate specialized talents. They recruit high school graduates and have a longer duration of study than specialized schools. Medical schools have five years, and other colleges have four years. Universities are divided into colleges of liberal arts, science, law, education, engineering, business, medicine, and agriculture. A school must have three or more colleges, and one of the colleges must be in science, agriculture, engineering, or medicine, to be called a university. If there is only one or two colleges, it cannot be called a university, but only a "College of..." For example, the National Shanghai College of Commerce has only one college of commerce, so it is called the Shanghai College of Commerce. Another example is the private Ginling Women's Arts and Science College, which consists of the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Science, but does not have three colleges, so it is called Ginling Women's Arts and Science College, and cannot be called Ginling Women's University. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 21st and 22nd academic years, there are a total of 41 universities nationwide, including 13 national universities, 8 provincial universities, and 20 private universities. There are a total of 38 independent colleges nationwide, including  national colleges, 11 provincial colleges, and 22 private colleges. There are a total of 79 universities and independent colleges. Among these 79 schools, 48 have colleges of liberal arts, 31 have colleges of law, 16 have colleges of commerce, and 13 have colleges of education. These belong to the liberal arts category, totaling 108 colleges. 41 have colleges of science, 22 have colleges of engineering, 13 have colleges of medicine, and 13 have colleges of agriculture. These belong to the science and engineering category, totaling 89 colleges. In terms of national universities and independent colleges, there are more colleges in the liberal arts category. There are a total of 37,257 students in national universities and independent colleges, including 19,139 in public institutions and 18,118 in private institutions. Comparing public and private institutions, the number of students is not very different, but the number of schools is greater in private institutions (37 public institutions and 42 private institutions), which is the opposite of specialized schools. Furthermore, the total number of students in specialized schools, universities, and independent colleges is 41,768. Separating by field of study, there are 15,698 science and engineering students in the colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, and 26,041 liberal arts students in the colleges of liberal arts, law, commerce, and education. (28 students have not been assigned to a college and are not included in the percentage calculation). The percentage is 63.39% for liberal arts and 37.61% for science and engineering. There are almost twice as many liberal arts students as science and engineering students.</p>
<p>The distribution of national universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools also varies greatly. The place with the most is Shanghai, with 27 schools. The place with the least is one school, such as in Anhui and Yunnan provinces. Some provinces do not have a single school, such as Guizhou province. This is due to transportation and cultural factors. In the future, we should pay attention to adding one or two schools in places without schools above the specialized level to adjust higher education.</p>
<p>University graduate schools recruit university undergraduates to study advanced academics and provide a place for faculty to research. The research period is at least two years. They are located within universities or independent colleges and are divided into graduate schools of liberal arts, science, law, education, agriculture, commerce, and medicine. Those with three or more graduate schools are called graduate schools, and those that have not established three graduate schools are only called a certain graduate school, not a graduate school. There are ten universities and one college in China with graduate schools, namely the National Central University's Graduate School of Science, Department of Mathematics, Graduate School of Agriculture, Department of Agronomy, Peking University's Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Department of Chinese Literature and History, Graduate School of Science, Department of Mathematics, Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Law, Tsinghua University's Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Department of Chinese Literature, Department of Foreign Languages, Department of Philosophy, Department of History, Graduate School of Science, Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry, Department of Mathematics, Department of Biology, Graduate School of Law, Department of Political Science, Department of Economics, Wuhan University's Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Department of Economics, Sun Yat-sen University's Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Department of Chinese Language and Literature, Department of History, Graduate School of Education, Department of Education, Department of Educational Psychology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Department of Forestry, Department of Soil Science, Peiyang Engineering College's Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Mining and Metallurgy, Private University of Nanking's Graduate School of Science, Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Agriculture, Department of Agricultural Economics, Soochow University's Graduate School of Law, Department of Law, Yenching University's Graduate School of Science, Department of Chemistry, Department of Biology, Graduate School of Law, Department of Political Science, Graduate School of Liberal Arts, Department of History, Nankai University's Graduate School of Science, Department of Chemical Engineering, Graduate School of Commerce, Department of Economics, Lingnan University's Graduate School of Science, Department of Biology, Department of Chemistry. There are a total of 32 graduate schools, seven in science, five in law, four in liberal arts, three in agriculture, two in engineering, and one each in commerce and education, but there are no graduate schools in medicine.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary Schools (1)   Special Dispatch from This Newspaper   Investigation by Hu Zuyin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has established six Chinese elementary day schools and two night schools within the concession, with a total of 4,886 students. This article will provide a brief introduction to the various facilities of the Chinese elementary day schools and night schools established by the Municipal Council. As for the various facilities of the Western Public School and Chinese Middle School established by the Municipal Council, they are not within the scope of this article and will be temporarily omitted. The author is grateful to Mr. Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, for his guidance, and to the principals of the Chinese elementary day schools and the directors of the night schools for providing materials.</p>
<p>1.  History of School Establishment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council established Chinese elementary schools starting on October 8, 1928. The Municipal Council had already established four Chinese middle schools in the concession, but Chinese elementary schools had not yet been opened. Mr. Yu Qiaqing and other Chinese directors, in view of the large number of young school-age children in the concession, proposed at the initial meeting of the Public Concession Board of Directors that more Chinese elementary schools should be established in the concession, and that they should be managed by Chinese. After detailed discussion by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, it was approved that two Chinese elementary schools should be established on a trial basis by the Chinese first, and Mr. Chen Heqin, an expert in children's education, was hired as the Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council to preside over Chinese education in the concession.</p>
<p>On October 8, 1928, the Municipal Council officially opened the Eastern District and Northern District Chinese elementary schools: the Eastern District Elementary School was located at No. 150 Huishan Road; the Northern District Elementary School was located at No. 228 Bagan Road. Both schools rented Western-style residences. Initially, the two schools had a total of only 165 students. In September 1930, the Northern District Elementary School on Bagan Road moved into the Chinese Public School building on Kenning Road. (Because the Chinese Public School had a larger school building elsewhere) From then on, the Northern District Elementary School had a formal school building. In September of the same year, the Municipal Council rented a civil house at No. 914 Avenue Road in the Western District and opened a Western District Elementary School. At this time, the number of Chinese elementary schools had increased to three: the number of students had also increased to 1,147.</p>
<p>2.  Eight-Year Education Plan</p>
<p>In order to plan and improve the educational facilities in the concession, the Municipal Council established a School Affairs Committee on June 18, 1930. The committee had a total of nine members, and the Chinese members who participated successively included Mr. Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Zheqing, and Xi Yushu. The committee suggested to the Municipal Council in 1931 that an eight-year education plan be implemented. This education plan was formally approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, but it was reserved for reconsideration at the end of 1934. The aspects of the eight-year education plan related to the expansion and improvement of Chinese education included: (1) From 1931 to 1938, two Chinese elementary schools for both boys and girls should be added each year, each accommodating 600 students. (2) One Chinese girls' middle school should be added in 1931; another Chinese girls' middle school should be added before the end of 1934. (3) The existing four Chinese Public Schools should be gradually converted into more definitive middle schools, in line with the middle school system promulgated by the Chinese government. (4) The principals, administrative staff, and teachers of Chinese middle schools should, as far as possible, be replaced by competent Chinese personnel. (5) Private Chinese elementary and middle schools in the concession that are well-managed may request financial assistance from the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>According to the above education plan, the Municipal Council rented a civil house at No. 233 Meadow Road on September 9, 1931, and opened a Chinese girls' middle school. In April 1932, it rented the original school building of the Zhaoshangju Public School on Huade Road and opened a Huade Road Chinese elementary school. In September 1932, a new Chinese elementary school building was completed on Xinzha Road; the students of the Western District Elementary School, which was originally studying on Avenue Road, formally moved into the new school building for classes. In February 1933, a new school building was completed on Jingzhou Road; it officially started enrolling students on March 1 of the same year. At this time, the Municipal Council also purchased the Huishan Road Eastern District Elementary School building and converted it into the Eastern District Girls' Elementary School building; the newly opened Jingzhou Road Elementary School was converted into the Eastern District Boys' Elementary School. The Huade Road Elementary School was a co-educational elementary school for both boys and girls in the Eastern District. Regarding the third, fourth and fifth points, the Municipal Council also made efforts to implement them within a considerable range, which will not be repeated here. At that time, the world was in a state of depression, and the Shanghai Public Concession was also deeply affected. The Municipal Council's various tax revenues decreased sharply; therefore, at the end of 1934, the Municipal Council Board of Directors reconsidered the eight-year education plan proposed by the School Affairs Committee and temporarily suspended its implementation. As a result, the plan to add two Chinese elementary schools each year was not fully realized.</p>
<p>In October 1935, the Municipal Council opened a Jingzhou Road night school in the Lizhou Road Elementary School building, enrolling male workers who worked in factories and had not completed elementary school. In February of this year, it opened a Huishan Road night school in the Huishan Road Eastern District Girls' Elementary School building, enrolling female workers who worked in factories and had not completed elementary school. In April of this year, it added a two-part Chinese elementary school at the original site of the  Road Western Public School. To date, the Municipal Council has opened six Chinese elementary day schools and two night schools in the concession. The names, addresses, and establishment dates of the eight schools are surveyed and copied below:</p>

<h3>East China Universities Prepare for Speech and Debate Competition</h3>
<p>The Speech and Debate Association, organized by students from universities in East China, has been hosted by National Central University this year. It has been established for many years, and the English and Chinese speech and debate competitions held in previous years have achieved excellent results. It is now known that the speech and debate competition for this semester is being prepared by National Central University in Nanjing. Letters will be sent to member schools such as Jiaotong, Jinan, Fudan, Guanghua, Daxia, Ginling, Soochow, Datong, Chizhi, and Fazheng to first hold representative preliminary elections, and then convene a representative assembly on a regular basis to discuss the competition date, location, judges, and other matters.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Notifies Public and Private Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Purchase the "Modern High School Composition Essence" and "Modern Junior High School Composition Essence" published by the Diligent Bookstore, No. 392 Laozhaoshenfu Road. These two books are collections of selected student compositions from over 4,000 middle schools across the country. The education authorities have unanimously praised them. After reading these books, students can expand their writing ideas, broaden their minds, and study the works of others, which will increase their own thoughts and writing skills. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has issued Order No. 425 to the city's private middle schools to purchase these books. The original order is recorded as follows: "According to the report of the Diligent Bookstore, No. 392 Laozhaoshenfu Road, 'The Bureau believes that middle school students are the backbone of society, and the Chinese language course is the foundation of all courses. Whether it is in terms of individuals or society, it will affect the entire nation and country in the future. Therefore, during the middle school period, the writing skills of composition must be rigorously practiced in order to express ideas clearly and accurately, so that they can further their studies and research various academic subjects, and can retreat to apply practical knowledge and serve society. Otherwise, if the foundation is not solid, they will lose their way, and in recent years, middle school students have neglected basic literature and art because of their research in science, resulting in poor performance and difficulty in mastering various subjects. If they want to further their studies in various academic subjects, they must first work hard, explore literature and art, practice writing, and demand an increase in writing ability. Although there is more than one way, reading appropriate works is the most important. Although there are many publications on the market, they are either lengthy works or have complex ideas, which are not suitable for middle school students to read. In the past, although there were publications of student achievements, the themes were limited to classics and history, and the ideas tended to be outdated, which is not what is needed in the current era of rapid production and construction. Moreover, there is no object of comparison, and if they are allowed to explore blindly, progress will be slow. In response to this need, the Bureau has collected student composition achievements from public and private high schools and junior high schools in various provinces and cities across the country, spending six months, edited by Ma Chonggan, and reviewed by experts Hu Pu'an, He Shuangqiu, Xie Engao, and others. Based on the Chinese language curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, we have selected the National Modern High School Composition Essence and the National Modern Junior High School Composition Essence, each in four volumes. The content is divided into thirteen categories, and the themes include the universe, insects, and the construction of national revival. This is a textbook for middle school students to study on their own after class, to compare and contrast themselves, and to supplement the deficiencies of the Chinese language textbook, promote writing skills, and is necessary for general middle school students. We respectfully attach a copy of each book for your review and request your approval to notify all public and private high schools and junior high schools in the city to consider purchasing them and inform students to purchase them to promote and value culture, which is a great public benefit.' According to this, the selection standards of the two books, National Modern High School Composition Essence and National Modern Junior High School Composition Essence, published by the bookstore, are still practical. If the schools need them, they can consider purchasing them. In addition to the approval and separate orders, the school is hereby ordered to be informed. This order is issued by Director Pan Gongzhan on October 16, 1936. The special price for the two books is 1.7 yuan each, and the special price for purchasing any two books together is 3 yuan. The registered postage for each book is 16 cents. The bookstore's retail department at No. 277 Sima Road in this city also sells them at the same price."</p>

Furthermore, the association held a standing committee meeting yesterday at the YMCA, resolving: (1) to hold the mathematics discussion on November 18th at the East Hall on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, soliciting topics from various schools and assigning Shanghai High School and Guanghua School to be responsible for organizing them; (2) to organize a lecture group, appointing Zheng Xi-gu, Liao Mao-ru, Sun Kang-zeng, Yin Yi-wen, and Shen Ti-lan as speakers, with the topic set as "Youth and the Nation," and tasking Zheng Xi-gu and Liao Mao-ru with drafting an outline, first lecturing at member schools of the association and then giving public speeches to stimulate public morale; (3) to request the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in implementing special education, such as providing anti-gas equipment, military lectures, and military drills.

<h3>Accumulation of Newly Added Equipment Value in National Higher Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday released statistics comparing the accumulated value of newly added equipment in national colleges and universities over the past few years, as follows:</p>
<p>(Explanation) (1) The terms A, B, and C each represent value, accumulated value over the years, and multiple of accumulated value over the years. All values are in units of one thousand yuan. For example, A value of 81 for health equipment means 81,000 yuan. The rest can be inferred similarly. Also, a multiple of 1.00 means one time, and 1.99 means one time plus 99% of a fraction, less than two times. The rest can be inferred similarly. (2) The value of school equipment for the 20th year (of the Republic) is 923,000 yuan, including health equipment. The expenditure on health equipment for that year was not analyzed separately. (3) In terms of the average percentage of each item, health equipment accounts for 1.83%, school equipment accounts for 15.33%, books account for 17.54%, instruments and machines account for 28.49%, and building repairs account for 36.81%.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Art Academy Volleyball Team Visits Shanghai - Winning the First Battle, Slightly Defeating Chi Chee University - Chi Chee University's Efforts Fall Short at Three to Two</h3>
<p>The National Hangzhou Art Academy volleyball team has been the champion team in Hangzhou for many years. Recently, it surpassed its strong rival Aviation Team in the same city to win the Martyr's Cup Championship for the 25th year (of the Republic). Most of the team members, such as Zhao Yun-xiu, Zhao Chong-huo, and He Shu-sheng, are famous players from the National Games. This season, new players Mo Gui-xin and Wei Zhi-yang have been added, making the team even more formidable. The team, led by team leader Mr. Li Xin-biao, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning for sightseeing. Yesterday afternoon, they played a friendly match with the strong Chi Chee University team at the university's court. The two powerful teams met, resulting in a fiercely contested match. After the exchange, the Art Academy was sharp and aggressive, with flexible coordination between the front and back rows, taking the lead with a score of 21 to 11. In the second and third games, Chi Chee University refused to give in, with the forwards and guards shouting in unison, quickly winning with two scores of 21 to 18, reversing the situation to two to one and gaining the upper hand. All that was needed was to win one more game to secure the final victory. Both sides were attacking and defending, making it difficult to break the deadlock. However, the Art Academy's forwards Wei and Zhao were skilled in spiking and pressing, their attacks as sharp as cannonballs. He Shu-yun coordinated in the center, making every shot count, and they managed to win back the fourth game with a score of 21 to 12, resulting in a tie. The final decisive game was particularly tense, with both sides putting everything on the line, unwilling to give an inch. Chi Chee University had the right to change sides first, giving them a superior position. Unexpectedly, the Art Academy launched a surprise attack, catching the home team off guard, and quickly took the lead with a score of 21 to 16, securing the final victory. The overall result was three to two, with Chi Chee suffering a slight defeat. The lineups were as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities - Both Long and Short Positions Wait and See in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange resumed trading after being closed for a day, the market situation still hovered without much rise or fall. In general, it has not yet escaped the brewing stage. It is difficult to predict whether there will be any changes in the future. Both the long and short positions have their own reasons for observing, so they are observing each other, and the situation is even more stagnant. Before Sino-Japanese diplomacy can be opened up, the market price will likely not develop easily. Yesterday's progress: In the morning, the type C bonds opened slightly firm, but later the selling pressure was slightly stronger, and the subsequent ones all saw weakness, falling by a small 5/100th to 2.5/100ths of a yuan. In the closing session, retail investors sold, which was relatively lively, and then fell by another 5/100ths to 2/100ths of a yuan. In the afternoon opening, the 32nd and 35th numbers saw quite a bit of selling, and the type C quick delivery fell by 0.3 yuan, while the rest also fell by a small 5/100ths to 2/100ths of a yuan. Only the type A forward contracts were good by 0.1 yuan. At the close, scattered retail investors bought, and the table rose while the shorts covered their positions. Although the type C continued to fall slightly by about 0.1 yuan, the rest all rose slightly by 5/100ths to 2/100ths of a yuan. As a result, the market price was slightly better for the type A of this month by 5/100ths of a yuan, while the rest all fell slightly by 5/100ths to 0.3 yuan. The total turnover was 4,315,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Amidst Cheerful Yarn Sales, Stocks of Chinese and Foreign Yarn Mills Surge</h3>
<p>Recently, cotton yarn sales have surged, and various yarn mills are unable to meet the demand, with a hectic pace of business. Operations have improved, and profits are very high. The stock market naturally began to buy stocks of yarn mills. Stock prices rose sharply. The old stocks of Shanghai Japanese yarn mills rose by 20%, and the new stocks rose by 30%. The stocks of the British-owned Ewo Yarns soared. Chinese yarn mill stocks also rose, but Chinese mill stocks are not publicly traded, so trading is reduced. The price increase is also about 20%.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn   October Cotton Yarn   Settlement Overview and Process   Yarn Price Soars, Peak Reaching 240 Yuan   Settlement Amount Totals 7,550 Bales   Cotton Price Hits High of 43.60 Yuan   Amount Reaches 113,400 Dan</h3>
<p>Yarn: The October contract of Yu Ji Brand Yarn started at 203 yuan on September 1st of this year, showing a slight increase. Following the announcement of the Sino-British currency issue, public sentiment became uneasy. Coupled with rampant smuggling in North China and sluggish real demand, bearish forces seized the opportunity to become highly active, with heavy selling pressure. Market prices plummeted, breaking the 200 yuan mark in mid-month, reaching a low of 196.10 yuan. Subsequently, due to vigorous buying from certain quarters, rumors of the issuance of circulating notes, and a general surge in overseas yarn and cotton prices, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and market prices rebounded. By early July, estimates of American cotton yields surged by 60 points, further boosting market confidence, and prices advanced, reaching a peak of 219.80 yuan. Subsequently, due to abundant cotton production in our country, cotton prices declined, selling pressure resurfaced, and financial sentiment shifted from bullish to bearish, returning to 196 yuan. In the most recent two months, due to the development of yarn sales and brisk purchasing by various merchant groups, almost all 30,000 bales of spot goods in yarn and cloth warehouses were swept away. Factories reported yarn shortages, and market prices rose steadily. Short sellers became greatly alarmed, with the highest price reaching 240 yuan, marking a new high in five years. The closing price was 211.11 yuan, an increase of 28 yuan from the opening price. As a result, 7,550 bales remained, an increase of 1,200 bales compared to the previous month. The settlement price for the last three days was averaged at 236 yuan, a sharp increase of 35 yuan compared to the previous month. The delivered goods included 450 bales of new 20-count Jincheng yarn, 200 bales of Shuanglu yarn, 50 bales of Jinta yarn, and the remainder being old stocks. The brokerage firms and quantities involved in the delivery between the buying and selling parties are recorded below:</p>

<p>Cotton: The October cotton contract opened at 41.15 yuan on May 1st of this year. At that time, due to the good yarn market, prices rebounded after falling, struggling around the 40 yuan mark for a long time. On July 8th, the estimate of American cotton fields was released, jumping 60 points, and market sentiment soared, rising to 43.10 yuan. Subsequently, on August 20th, the estimate of cotton production in our country was released, indicating a bumper harvest, with the national output exceeding 16.1 million dan. The market was shaken, and selling pressure was strong. At the same time, the banking sector shifted from bullish to bearish with large volumes. Market prices plummeted, with the low reaching 36.85 yuan. Recently, due to the improvement in yarn sales, the amount of short selling was said to be difficult to fulfill. Prices soared by more than 2 yuan in one day, with the peak reaching 43.60 yuan. A day later, due to the authorities' efforts, the settlement was expected to be resolved. Prices plunged 1.5 yuan to close at 40.07 yuan. As a result, 113,400 dan remained. The settlement price for the three days was averaged at 41 yuan. The delivered goods included Chen Zu Rong, Taicang cotton, Huoji cotton, Shaanxi cotton, Shashi cotton, and Lingshi cotton.

<h3>Spot Yarn Prices Still Fall on Settlement Day</h3>
<p>Due to the October settlement procedures for marked yarn and cotton, the Chang Market stopped its meetings. Spot yarn merchants still came to the market. Spot business remained sluggish, and customer appetite was weak. It was found that only 170 bales were traded by inland merchants in the morning and 10 bales by Guangdong merchants, totaling 180 bales. The selling price fell by 1 to 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>New American Cotton Sales Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. Prices for various months fell by two points to rise by one point. Industry players and foreign merchants bought in, but short selling continued to increase. New sales were greatly reduced, and most industry players remained on the sidelines. Real demand was relatively quiet, and the footing was still solid. The cloth market was firm but stagnant. Some short covering occurred at the close, stabilizing the market to some extent. Spot prices fell by one point, while futures prices fell by one to five points. British cotton spot prices fell by seven points, while futures prices fell by one to four points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to long liquidation, but then firmed due to short covering by some and buying by industry players. However, it softened again due to selling by brokers. Pingguoer fell by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.5 to 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi remained unchanged, according to the original telegram. (Telegram of the 29th)</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 30th was: Bailuoxi at 218 rupees, down 0.75 rupees; Aomula at 195.5 rupees, down 1 rupee; and Pingguoer at 157 rupees, down 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods   Factory Fine Cloths Due on the Expiry Date   Trading Houses Quite a Few Selling Off at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was quiet due to the marked yarn and cotton settlements. Moreover, as the end of the month approached, most trading houses had ordered fine cloths from Japanese factories for this month. According to Japanese factories' usual practice, even without spot goods, they must all be delivered. Therefore, those who thought the price would fall secretly reduced prices, and quite a few were selling off. The market was chaotic, but the factories had no intention of lowering prices, so most who held goods were prepared to put up money and wait for next month's market. Moreover, the remaining amount for the month was not much. Customers and merchants on this street lacked the intention to buy, only urging to finalize orders. Currently, cloth factories have many orders and are not delivering. However, due to the yarn and thread shortage that affected them weeks ago, the number of deliveries was greatly reduced, causing delays and resulting in huge outstanding orders. This factory's coarse cloths rose too quickly weeks ago, reaching as high as 2.3 yuan. Although they are gradually falling back now, it is still difficult to stabilize. Yesterday, each factory's heavy coarse cloths still fell by 1 to 2 jiao. The market for colored goods such as oblique blue cloth, Zhigong Serge, crepe and printed goods was soft, and selling prices had not yet changed. Only white flannel, double-sided flannel and colored striped flannel continued to sell well, with shortages of spot goods, making them the most popular.</p>
<h3>Western Suit Fabrics (Shameen) are Even More Popular</h3>
<p>Shameen has been selling well recently. Tailor shops of local merchants on this street all need to purchase it because customers who order custom-made Western suits from door shops all specifically choose it. However, most of what is currently in the market is lower-grade domestic goods priced at 4 to 5 yuan per yard. The higher-grade, plain gray, solid color Western suit fabrics priced at 7 to 8 yuan per yard are quite scarce. Therefore, brokers have been busy running the streets to search for them recently. Although the quantity is not large, the atmosphere has become tighter, and prices have risen accordingly. Yesterday, genuine first-grade Shameen was being sold by retailers at 12 yuan per yard, and ordinary Shameen was being sold at 8.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food   Flour Slightly Set Back by Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a downward trend in all months after the opening of the market in the morning. This was because the price of foreign wheat was reported to be falling, with Chicago down 2 to 3 jiao, Canada down about 7 jiao, and Liverpool down 1 to 2 pence. Therefore, when prices opened, people felt very uneasy, and near and far month prices immediately fell by about 2 fen. Moreover, there was talk that the Tianjin Exchange would hold regular auctions. After that, there would likely be competition, so there was very little trading after the market opened, and prices were slightly flat. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was busier, and the market rose slightly. People in the industry thought that although the price of foreign wheat had fallen, the price was still not close, so they resisted very strongly. According to this trend, perhaps if the rumored tax exemption on foreign wheat gives factories ample stock to dump, then people will easily comply.</p>
<h3>Australian Wheat May Be Exported   Futures Wheat Is Difficult to Rally</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw prices fall in all months when the market opened in the morning. This was because the price of foreign wheat was reported to be falling sharply, and it was rumored that Australian wheat could be exported, and prices were easing, which was not without reason. Therefore, when prices opened, the prices for each month were 3 to 4 fen to 7 to 8 fen lower than the previous day. However, because the national wheat falling order made stocks in the market tight, trading was not very busy. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still slow. However, because the flour market did not fall much and there were few sellers, prices rose again, recovering 4 to 5 fen compared to the morning. In the spot wheat market, high-grade goods had not opened, and second-grade goods prices remained stable. Shandong wheat opened at 6.05 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 6.05 yuan, Jue Ling wheat at 6.01 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 6.02 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 6.03 yuan, Hankou wheat at 5.8 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 5.94 yuan, Huaian wheat at 5.97 yuan, and Chongming wheat at 5.75 yuan. Fuxin purchased 10,000 bags and Fufeng purchased more than 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>River Rice Sales Recover After Price Drop</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 44 to 45 boats from various merchants arrived with a total of more than 9,000 shi of goods, mostly new and thin rice. Therefore, the thin rice market initially weakened as customer appetite waned and retail sales were sluggish. Sellers' asking prices were quite low, and the price drop was very strong. However, after this drop, merchants were active again. As a result, Qingying, Pingjin and other merchants bought more than 3,000 bags, with prices of high-quality goods falling 2 jiao 3 to 5 fen. Prices for medium-grade goods plummeted by as much as 4 to 5 jiao. Thick new japonica rice also fell by 1.5 jiao. Only Du Yangjian, due to the scarcity of goods, was still considered firm. New Yin Yuan, on the other hand, continued to decline, depreciating another 2 jiao. Thick and thin broken japonica rice was mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 33 to 34 boats arrived from the river, and the market was quiet. The market price of particularly new japonica rice was firm. The prices of medium and broken new japonica rice were slightly tight. The price of Yangbu Kejian rice increased by 1 jiao, and the price of Du Jian followed closely by 6 to 7 fen. The appetite for high-quality green-seed goods was active, and prices were still peaceful. The retail price of medium-grade goods was also sluggish, down by about 1 jiao. The price of Bian Yuan was short by 1 jiao, and the price of Yin Yuan was down by another 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Customer Xiang Rice from Henan Province Continues to Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xiang rice market had the appearance of continuing to soar, but in the end, it was still strong, while the Guangdong merchants' appetite slightly waned, so the market price failed to rise again. However, due to the high production price, the owners insisted on holding on, and although the Guangdong merchants did not buy as greedily as the previous day, they still picked high-quality rice to absorb. In addition to buying 3,000 bags of high-quality rough rice, the Guangdong merchants also traded more than 2,000 bags of early Jiangxi machine-milled rice. The Henan merchants also continued to buy various early machine-milled rice, only regretting that the amount of Dongliang was insufficient and they could not buy freely. After that, appetite was still strong and smooth. The appetite of merchants on this street was still active, so although trading decreased, prices still rose by 3 to 5 fen to nearly 1 jiao. Throughout the day, 5,250 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,250 bags of Xiang rice, 1,000 bags of Han rough rice, and 50 bags of factory Yuan rice were traded.</p>
<h3>Metals   Club Iron Supply is Disrupted</h3>
<p>Countries Expanding Armaments… Output Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Two hundred-pound club iron is in very good condition due to the scarcity of both arrivals and inventory. Recently, Japan has been searching overseas, resulting in even fewer goods coming to China. The market price has suddenly risen. Currently, old Gangchang goods are selling for 36 yuan per box, new Gangchang goods for 35 yuan, and Yaji goods for 34.5 yuan, which is 5 jiao to 1 yuan better than before. According to industry sources, countries have been actively expanding their armaments recently, and the output of club iron has been greatly reduced. There are no goods in the near term, and even for the long term, futures orders can only be placed for February and March of next year. Therefore, the supply of goods arriving in the Shanghai market is bound to be scarce. It was found that as many as six to seven hundred boxes were traded in the market yesterday. Most buyers were customers and can factories on this street, while factories such as toy and cigarette factories have been quieter recently.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market   Mianchi and Shantou Products Turn Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was tending towards flat and soft. The association's benchmark for No. 24 coarse sugar white spot was 11.6 yuan, with no upward limit. Transit goods were 6.15 yuan, down by 5 fen. Dongbai numbers 4, 8 and 9 were all priced at the original price, with few transactions. The price of Mianbai No. 1 from this factory was 20.5 yuan, No. 2 was 20.1 jiao, No. 3 was 19.7 yuan, No. 4 was 19.3 jiao, and No. 5 was 18.9 jiao. As the production price of numbered Mianchi goods has softened recently, the price has also decreased, around 5 or 6 jiao compared to the high price. Hainan Red goods were tending to be firmer, with no ups or downs. Miscellaneous Red goods were also rarely opened. The market was flat and tired.</p>
<p>The joint company held the third tender for Guangdong sugar this week. The total quota was more than 7,600 bags. The tender price was the same as before, but there were still few transactions. Only 315 bags of Shunde factory's Wuyang group white sugar were sold at 21.5 yuan, 100 bags of Shixin factory's sugar were sold at 21.3 jiao, 1 first bag of Shantou Gao was sold at 21.3 jiao, and 100 bags of ordinary sugar were sold at 21.1 jiao. Both Juezhuang and Medium Sand White tenders were not sold at the original price. In total, only 615 bags were sold.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods   Raw Dried Meat Supply Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Twenty-one pieces arrived yesterday... Samples can be seen today</p>
<p>The supply of raw dried longan meat has been scarce recently, and the market has been firm. It was found that the Jiaying wheel imported goods such as those from Shikma and Tongan yesterday, totaling only twenty-one pieces. As a result, public sentiment was quite good. It is said that the samples can be seen and opened today, and it is expected that the price of the same meat will increase by 1 to 2 yuan. Because the price of yard meat has reached 60 yuan, it may need to be temporarily fixed.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea   Overseas Silk Market Active   Hua Silk Exports Turn Into a Dilemma</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Lack Raw Materials and Cannot Meet Market Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market saw the New York Exchange trade at the original price for both near-term and far-term goods. Yokohama rose by about 2 to 7 yuan in the morning, but fell back by about 12 yuan in the afternoon. The Lyon silk market remained firm. Shanghai silk AB grades both rose by 2 francs, and Guangdong silk rose by 0.5 francs. Because the asking price of silk in Shanghai was too high, both domestic and foreign silk sales were small. At this time of activity in the foreign silk market, it was a good opportunity for exports, but looking at the recent market situation, it is becoming a dilemma, which is quite puzzling. However, manufacturers generally have their own difficulties. It is said that apart from larger silk institutions such as Jianting and Yongtai, the lack of raw materials has become a common phenomenon. Therefore, although some silk factories do not stop production from November to December, the current price of silk cannot be lowered, and it is difficult to sell at a high price. The fact that exports have accounts but no silk and goods but no accounts is still a common occurrence over the years, which is a major shortcoming for the entire silk industry. It is hoped that the Silk Improvement Bureau will also pay attention to this shortcoming in the organization of raw silk businesses.</p>
<h3>Special Article   The Food Problem in Times of Crisis</h3>
<p>By Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Originally, the provinces and counties were already actively building warehouses, but for the sake of management, the warehouses in peacetime should be concentrated in each county, while in times of crisis, they should be distributed in various villages, and one should never put all eggs in one basket. The current Baojia system has been successful, and the existing local shrines and temples can be used as warehouses, which only requires a few carpentry and masonry jobs to establish community granaries. The chief of the Jia should be responsible for roughly calculating the amount of food needed by the local residents. Assuming one hundred households, averaging five people, then according to ancient precepts, one person needs two he of rice and one qian of salt, which means that each household needs one and a half dou of rice and ten jin of salt per day. Calculating the reserves for half a year, only six hundred shi of rice and twenty dan of salt are needed to avoid panic. If there is a shortfall, it should be purchased from outside as soon as possible, with a total value of no more than 2,000 yuan. If the chief of the Jia organizes a 500-yuan cooperative, with each share costing 5 yuan, plus a guarantee liability of four times, then they can borrow money from the bank to purchase goods. For every dan of grain stored in the community granary, 70% of the price should be paid first, and the remaining 30% should be paid in six installments. Then, a few long-term workers should be hired to hull and mill the rice, and the chief of the Jia should be responsible for this. A person should be sent by the bank to take custody of the granary, and the responsibility is only 1,000 yuan, so the person is easy to choose, and there is no need to worry about too many people. The actual situation of the community granary is easy to see, and there is a reliable guarantee on credit, and a People's Corps should be stationed in it to maintain order, and the danger of eating large households can also be avoided. On the bank's side, instead of bundling up banknotes and sending them out of the country, it is better to hide wealth among the people and make it circulate among the villages and towns to increase credit. When buying, banknotes are paid, and when selling, banknotes are also received. All chiefs of the Jia are elected by the heads of households, and they must have considerable credit and property. Therefore, I believe that the community granary system is very easy to implement, and it is also easy to prevent mildew and moths. Compared with centralized storage, it may produce many abuses, and it is difficult to relocate people and transport grain in times of crisis, which is not only half the effort but twice the result. As for paying 70% of the price, some may suspect that farmers will be reluctant. In fact, farmers always keep their own food after harvesting, and the reason why they are so eager to sell money is only 70% of the total. Today, in order to change money urgently, they are always killed in price and reluctantly give up, which is out of helplessness. Now, storing it in the society is more secure than storing it at home, regardless of whether it is for their own food. Under the Baojia system, it is not difficult to have sufficient food and troops to gain the trust of the people. I sincerely hope that our wise government will start doing it quickly. Jiaozi said, "The heavens have their own laws, which do not exist for Yao and do not perish for Jie." Therefore, I believe that regardless of whether it is a time of crisis or a time of peace, our people take food as their heaven, and we should act according to the laws of nature and fulfill our duties so that we will not be like the people of Qi who worry about the sky. However, in times of great chaos, the rural population will inevitably increase, so the amount of food reserves should be at least 30% more than usual.</p>

<h3>From the Women's Rights Movement to the Issue of Women's Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>By Shou Zhuo</p>
<p>The call for women's rights movement does not seem to be a recent discovery; however, what achievements have the women's rights movement actually made? Perhaps no one can answer with certainty! The purpose of the women's rights movement, to put it bluntly, is to seek equality between men and women. It can also be said that women want to break away from their previous inhuman status and rise to the status of humans, enjoying the rights that humans should enjoy and fulfilling the obligations that humans should fulfill. Of course, this goal should be universally achieved, not partially achieved, otherwise partial solutions and temporary solutions are not fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>Although in today's China, women can be seen in agencies and shops, and women's works are sometimes seen in literary publications, it seems that the women's rights movement has had a considerable effect. However, if we ask how society evaluates female employees? And how many employed women are there? What kind of work do professional women do? We will suddenly realize and make a definite judgment: the women's movement is still waiting for our self-improvement efforts.</p>
<p>The current era is an era of survival of the fittest. Only the fittest can survive—to obtain the right to survive—only the best can win—to break the bad environment. We demand to be fit, we demand to be excellent, only through self-improvement and hard work, only through practical work. Shouting a few slogans and begging for sympathy is just a self-deceptive means. As for the necessary conditions for self-improvement and hard work, at least the following three points should be possessed.</p>
<p>(1) Having correct thoughts—Before any preparation, we must correct wrong ideas and establish correct thoughts, and we must know that our demands are to establish equality at the foundation, and it is by no means a single pursuit of rights or satisfaction of pleasure. For example, we are indeed demanding women's suffrage; however, we absolutely should not mistakenly think that women's work in operating and raising children at home is despicable. We only demand to have an equal spirit, and there should be no habit of favoring men over women in politics, education, and society. Whether we are officials, teachers, or doing family work, we all have the same importance. As for some young women who think that the purpose of the women's rights movement is to free women from the shackles of the family and enjoy freedom outside the family as much as possible, so they are unwilling to work for the family and cannot serve the society, and they only learn some fashionable language, and share benefits and enjoy pleasure in the society, as a result, they only increase the society's degree of contempt for women, all of which are the result of wrong thoughts.</p>
<p>(2) Having a strong physique—We know that doing everything requires a healthy physique. Women must assume half of the responsibilities of society and the country, so of course they must first have a healthy physique. However, Chinese women have always been famous for being sentimental and sickly. The lack of physical fitness is indeed undeniable. Therefore, the general public opinion in society always says that women's work efficiency is far inferior to that of men. Is that really the case for women? We do not see women in Soviet Russia participating in military work and bearing the same responsibilities as men. There are also many women in rural China who operate in the fields in the same way as men. Is this not a powerful refutation? Therefore, as long as we actively train, it is not difficult to have a healthy physique to assume major responsibilities. Now we urgently need to awaken public attention and use our best efforts to forge a strong physique.</p>
<p>(3) Having specialized skills—Having—Having correct thoughts and a healthy physique, we must also have specialized skills before we can take on important responsibilities and go far. The so-called specialized skills are by no means knowing some smattering, but having in-depth research and long-term training on a certain business or a certain job. Once we take on this task, we can not only cope with it easily, but also maximize our personal talents and seek good results. Regarding this point, we ask people who run women's education to pay attention to professional training, and at the same time, we hope that women who are currently studying will decide on a direction and concentrate on the cultivation of specialized skills. Of course, professional training must adapt to the needs of the environment and cater to individual ambitions and abilities. It is by no means asking everyone to cut their feet to fit their shoes and take the same path.</p>
<h3>American Working Women</h3>
<p>— by Lu Shaba</p>
<p>— A Dialogue on the Current State of Women's Occupations in Various Countries —</p>
<p>A: Lately, I often hear people say that women seeking liberation must first achieve equality in employment. This demand is naturally based on the principle of economic independence, but perhaps it also stems from seeing the development of women's occupations in advanced countries, leading to this "slogan." I would like to know about the situation of working women in various countries. Could you start by telling me about the current situation of American working women?</p>
<p>B: Sure, sure, we can sit down and talk. Please feel free to ask.</p>
<p>A: I would like to know about the social status of American working women.</p>
<p>B: Their social status is among the highest in the world. However, their self-awareness is not as strong as that of British working women, but their social status is much higher than that of other countries.</p>
<p>A: How much salary do they earn per day?</p>
<p>B: Their employment scope is very broad... From editors-in-chief of newspapers and company presidents to typists and female sales clerks in department stores, they all live a very comfortable life. However, it cannot be generalized. Of course, women who have their own capital to run businesses are excluded. On average, most people earn an annual income of $5,000. The lowest-paid American working women are female sales clerks in department stores and office workers without special skills. During the current economic downturn, wages have fallen accordingly, with a maximum of twelve US dollars a week (equivalent to 36 yuan in national currency). The wages of female servants are even lower. During prosperous times, black people could earn $700 a month, but since the economic panic, things are no longer the same. As long as they have a place to live and food to eat, they are willing to work for others, regardless of how much they get paid! However, black cooks with skills still have very high salaries... Good white female servants can earn $35 a month. Many general working women work as stenographers and typists, earning $25 to $28 a week. Female secretaries can earn $60 to $100 a month.</p>
<p>A: Now I remember, let me ask about the departments where women work?</p>
<p>B: The number of women employed is not much different from that of men. They participate in every occupational department and occupy a fairly important position. In politics, they also hold important positions such as county magistrates, mayors, and ambassadors. They also participate in various investigation and research work, such as scientific research institutes and mechanical engineering architectural design. This is rare for Chinese women. Because these women are engaged in high-level technical work that uses their brains, they receive more compensation.</p>
<p>A: Is the social infrastructure for working women in the United States complete?</p>
<p>B: The social infrastructure in the United States is quite developed.</p>
<p>A: Are there facilities such as daycare centers in the United States?</p>
<p>B: There are no facilities specifically established for working women, but their nature is the same as that of daycare centers.</p>
<p>A: When working women are sick, does the state have sanatoriums or other facilities?</p>
<p>B: Although the state does not have such facilities, each district also has public hospitals under the name of social undertakings, and medical expenses are only charged half price.</p>
<p>A: Are they concerned about politics? At what age do they have the right to vote? Do they abstain from voting during elections?</p>
<p>B: They are relatively concerned about politics. Generally, women have the right to vote at the age of twenty-one. Female workers in factories are mostly organized, so their political awareness is more obvious, and abstentions are rare. Some ordinary women pay more attention to politics, but most of them take a don't-ask-don't-tell attitude, and some even give up their right to vote.</p>
<h3>The Duty of Female Clerks</h3>
<p>— by Cheng Peizhen</p>
<p>When women in our community serve in society, in addition to having considerable knowledge and experience, they must also have a spirit of thrift, a humble attitude, and honest character. Then, the future development of our female clerks in various fields will be unlimited. If, once they have a position, they hold a proud attitude, extravagant desires, and romantic disposition, applying rouge and powder, and having disheveled hair, only engaging in dressing up, without taking their own duties as a prerequisite, then not only will they not fit the identity of a female clerk, but they will also have the nickname of a "vase," which is really a move to lower their own personality! Female clerks who like to show off are greatly tabooed by any organization or store, which is very unfavorable to their own future. Moreover, the monthly salary is limited. Why must the hard-earned money be spent on extravagant decorations!</p>
<p>It must be known that the intention of public institutions and capitalists to hire female clerks is to promote the development of women's careers and to seek a livelihood for women. Because women's work spirit is relatively meticulous, their temperament is also more gentle, and their salaries are slightly lower than those of male clerks. On the one hand, they cater to the psychology of the public, which can attract customers, "customers are happy with the amiable female clerks," which is of great importance to the future of the business. They are not hiring a few female clerks to serve as vase-like decorations! I hope that our dear female comrades will unite together, maintain their inherent personality and credit, and promote the development of our women's rights. Our 200 million female compatriots across the country will also have glory.</p>
<p>As for the public institutions, there are also many female comrades working here. Their knowledge and experience are relatively more noble. Of course, they are much less interested in unnecessary luxury and vanity! However, female clerks with higher positions are inevitably infected by material civilization in social occasions, which is a major reason for the unstable lives of some women in society. Especially women who live in big cities, those who can be thrifty and keep themselves clean are indeed rare and valuable people.</p>
<p>In short, since we women have considerable occupations, we can be economically independent, and can reduce part of the burden of fathers, brothers, or husbands, and can also supplement the insufficiency of family finances. In general, women cannot fail to understand the heavy burden of fathers, brothers, or husbands, and the difficulty of making a living.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of writing this article, I will write down the thrift and hardworking spirit of my friend, Ms. Sun Yingxue.</p>
<p>She is a 24-year-old girl from a poor family who lost her education in her childhood and only has an elementary school education. Five years ago, she entered the export department of a foreign firm as a small female clerk with a monthly salary of only twelve yuan. Because she is diligent in her work and has a humble nature, the manager of the firm also values her very much. Her knowledge and experience have also gradually improved. Now she has been promoted to the management director of the export department female clerks, and there are twelve female clerks under her command, so her future is also unlimited.</p>
<p>Her salary has gradually increased to thirty-five yuan. As for her daily life, she only rents a small room, with a rent of four yuan. The monthly expenditure is less than fifteen yuan. Her clothing is simple, and the decoration is simple, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. She only needs to eat a few hundred cents of food every day. At noon, she only buys a bowl of plain noodles to fill her hunger in the firm. Her thriftiness is indeed not forgetting the poverty of losing her parents early in her childhood. Therefore, she has not been to amusement parks or movie theaters for a year. On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, she does some laundry and needlework and knits woolen threads, so her financial situation is also very affluent. She now has savings of one thousand and several hundred yuan. In short, her savings come from thrift and hard work. Ms. Sun's character and work spirit are a good example worthy of worship in our women's community!</p>
<h3>Washing</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Wash away the dirt and return my purity</p>
<h3>Rural Women During Rice Harvesting Season</h3>
<p>— by Delin</p>
<p>Now it is the rice harvesting season. The autumn countryside is a scene of wealth and responsibility. The fields are full of laughter from farmers, both men and women. The picture of a joyous year with chickens and wine will be unfolded in the corners of bamboo fences, thatched huts, and rubble walls. Autumn! Lovely autumn, actually covering the usually barren fields with gold, waiting for people to collect it.</p>
<p>At this time, the farmers are working hard to thresh the rice. If you go to the countryside, you will see them waving in the autumn sun; those cut down and lying crisscrossed in the fields are not the fruitful and golden ears of rice? This is the price of hard work and sweat; this is the reward for hard work and dedication. Look, those who are crawling in the fields to cut rice; those who are carrying it on the paths, are not those hard-working farmers, both men and women?</p>
<p>Golden and fluffy hair, the bun dragged to the back! "The oily sweat flows on the forehead like winding little rivers. The two breasts rising in front tremble with each step. The small legs covered with mud, like a muddy lotus root, walk on the plain, put the burden in the corner of the chicken coop and cattle shed, run into the mud-brick thatched hut, untie the buttons of the clothes, bend the waist and put the nipples into the mouth of the infant who is not yet one year old and sleeping in the bamboo bed, shake the bamboo bed, and hum the tune of "rocking, baby, sleep for a while" in the mouth. What a simple life these rural women live, working hard all day long. In addition to working in the fields during the day, they also have to wash clothes, cook, and feed the baby. The ladies, young ladies, and young mistresses in the city are dedicated to fighting each other and competing for beauty, enjoying a superior life. Have they ever spent their hard work and sweat? They only use their bodies to seduce and exchange, and eventually become parasites of men, without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Special report from this newspaper</p>
<h3>Ms. Xie Zuyi Talks About the Young Women's Movement</h3>
<p>— by Ping</p>
<p>Young women must know their own responsibilities and have an independent personality! Automatically seek improvement in life and upward consciousness!</p>
<p>Since moving to Jing'an Temple Road, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has a much more spacious building than the one on Yuanmingyuan Road, and its activities have also developed considerably. However, this YWCA is still far behind the YMCA. Is it really that women are no match for men? I hope that the women's community will also rise up together, unite and work hard to fully demonstrate the spirit of women serving society. Some people say that in the past year, under the planning and management of General Secretary Xie Zuyi, the association has made much more progress than before. Speaking of Ms. Xie's knowledge and talent, it is indeed very superior. She is originally from Sichuan. She grew up in Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' School. After graduation, she stayed in the United States for six years and obtained a Master of Arts in Sociology from the University of Chicago. When she was studying in the United States, she had done practical work in the YWCA. She felt that studying sociology should be related to the real society and engaging in the movement to improve society. So doing this work is exactly what she learned. It was also a coincidence. Last year, when she returned to Shanghai, she was honored to be the General Secretary. The other day, I went to visit her and asked her to express her opinions on the young women's movement. There are two main points that can be reported to readers.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Until now, many people still do not understand the purpose of the young women's movement. The YWCA is actually a group of women who are transforming society. It is a social education mechanism and a pioneer of the women's movement; leading countless enthusiastic young women, based on Christ's mission to transform society, cultivating women's self-awareness and solidarity. It is international and permanent. No matter what country it is, monarchical and democratic, or dictatorial and communist, there are YWCA organizations. For example, in the Soviet Union, there is no YWCA in name, but similar women's groups still exist. The so-called self-awareness means that every woman must understand her own responsibility to the society and the country, and the independent and upward personality, without being reminded by others, she must first realize it herself. The so-called solidarity means that each self-aware woman should unite together to seek her own liberation or participate in any movement, so that there is strength. Only then can the ultimate goal be achieved. The YWCA organizes women from all walks of life, so that they can automatically seek improvement in life and upward consciousness. The members include working women, working women, housewives, and general young women. According to the different ages and interests of all aspects, various effective trainings are implemented, and everyone's experience is exchanged, so that everyone feels satisfied. For example, for upper-class women and the intellectual class, the YWCA wants to awaken them to recognize the meaning of life, and use their talents, knowledge and money to assist others, and create leaders who serve all mankind. For lower-class women, enable them to increase their ability, seek their own liberation, and not rely on others to be pitiful parasites!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Our wish is that the YWCA will become a true central group for women from all walks of life. All work should not only have a close relationship with the women's community and seek the common happiness of the women's community; it must also have a relationship with all aspects of society, so that the outside world knows that this is a large group of women who are raising women's rights and doing practical work. Since the association moved into the new system last year, it has been very convenient to promote the association's affairs, and the necessary equipment is complete. The association is divided into eight departments: adult education, mass education, labor, young women, career introduction, dormitory, sports, and international branch. In terms of work: according to the needs of women from all walks of life, research societies (child psychology, current affairs research, women's issues, healthy living, etc.), friendship societies, visiting groups, celebrity speeches, travel, summer camps, and tutoring classes (foreign languages, home economics, social interaction, music, typing, etc.) are established. The association undertakes various affairs with the support of social women and men, seeking the highest efficiency of service with the most economical methods. We hope that all female compatriots in Shanghai can support us and participate in our activities to seek the well-being and harmony of the masses!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Ms. Xie also expressed some feelings about women's careers: 1. Now, young people in general show negative and disappointed emotions when they first come out to work, half because they are not diligent and half because they are limited by the environment and cannot develop their talents; and most women have too few opportunities to serve. In the future, I hope that men will give women more opportunities to serve. Women themselves should fully train and prepare themselves during their school years so that they can cope with all arduous tasks. At present, there is no talent in the women's community. In some places, the work of "discovering talent" cannot be done. Some people often criticize women for not being effective in their work. In fact, they use private individuals, private individuals with mediocre talents. Therefore, I say that from government agencies to companies and shops, it is necessary to select true talents and not bury brave and promising young people. Opportunities for employment in the vocational community must be completely equal and the vast avenues must be opened up as much as possible, so that everyone can use their talents to the best of their ability. Women must be self-aware and strive hard. The value of women will naturally increase and there will be a way out for liberation!</p>

<h3>The Subconscious (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— by Yin</p>
<p>The seats on the highway bus were not comfortable at all. Five people in a row were almost full, and it was difficult to turn around. When Yifan got on the bus, there were only three seats left on the last row, but that fat man was quick to grab one, and he squeezed Yifan away. He grabbed a seat by the window for himself, arranged his wife in the second one, and the innermost one—the most uncomfortable one in the center—was a favor he did to Yifan. And because he was too fat, he and his wife occupied two and a quarter seats in total. The seat Yifan occupied was not even one full seat, so he had to squeeze in reluctantly.</p>
<p>The fat military officer was naturally unnoticed, but his wife became the focus of all fourteen men in the car (there were only three women). Since Yifan got on the bus with them in front of the hostel and sat down next to her, he had never paid attention to her. Now he saw everyone staring at her in a daze, so he felt that he also had to take a look at her.</p>
<p>Of course, he looked at her. What was his impression after taking a look? Yifan's preconceived notion that the Northwest was a desert could not stand after this look. At the same time, he felt that a beautiful woman like her should not be traveling with that fat and stupid military officer. If that military officer had really abused her last night, it was an unforgivable and heinous crime. Because of this feeling, he was filled with pity and hatred. The pity was for the woman, and the hatred was for the military officer.</p>
<p>The military officer lowered his head and snored soon after getting on the bus. Moreover, he leaned his fat body against his wife as if his life depended on it. His wife looked very haggard, but she did not want to sleep, as if she was worried about something. However, she could not support her husband's fat body, so she leaned over to Yifan's side. Yifan saw that there was an old woman with white hair on his left, so of course he could not lean over to her. He had to use some strength to support them reluctantly. At this time, half of the woman's body was almost leaning on Yifan; her fluffy hair and mysterious fragrance immediately made Yifan, who had never been close to the opposite sex, feel a mysterious stimulus. He almost decided to use force to squeeze them back, but he felt that he could not bear to do so, because he knew that doing so would definitely make the military officer's wife in the middle attacked from both sides. He had to endure it reluctantly. However, another layer of difficulty arose, that is, his own line of sight, somehow, insisted on concentrating on the face of this military officer's wife and all other parts of her body, and the eyes of this military officer's wife seemed to be paying attention to him, and revealing a kind of amorous expression. Yifan felt that this was too dangerous, but luckily he had a few novels with him, so he took one out to look at. Unexpectedly, the woman also felt too bored, so she leaned closer and looked at it with him. It was very difficult for Yifan to see it from afar, so he simply handed the novel over and took one out himself. She did not refuse, but smiled sweetly at him. This smile distracted Yifan's attention from reading. Although his eyes were on her, he could not see the words on the book. It was as if they had all turned into white paper. Sometimes he would also slant his eyeballs and steal a glance at her. She did not seem to notice that Yifan was looking at her, but the page numbers on her book had not turned for a long time, and she read about ten minutes for one page. Later, she took out a lipstick from her wallet and wrote on Yifan's book: "Last name?" Yifan only whispered the word Liu; she wrote "Going? To," and Yifan, only Lanzhou. She wrote another "Together." Yifan gradually became bolder, so he pouted his mouth to the military officer and quietly asked, "Who is he?" She was still not answering, and wrote the word "Evil." As soon as this word was written, the two of them could not help but sigh at the same time. Fortunately, no one else noticed, so they secretly talked to each other with one question and one answer, and by the time the car arrived at a certain place, they were already very familiar with each other. Yifan's right hand and her left hand had also been tightly held together for two or three hours; later, she also wrote "Escape," "Escape" in large letters on the book. Yifan really did not have this courage, so he had to quietly comfort her and said, "Let's discuss it again when we get to Lanzhou."</p>
<p>That night, everyone was roughing it out near the station. Yifan really could not get used to that dirty pit life. He had not fallen asleep by midnight. He was sitting under a dim kerosene lamp, thinking blankly about the lovers he had met on the bus. Suddenly, he heard someone knocking on the door, followed by a trembling woman's voice arguing with the landlord. Yifan hurriedly rushed out to see what was going on. It was really her. As soon as she saw him, she rushed over and hugged him into the house. Before Yifan could sit down, she rushed to tell him that her husband had just received an emergency order and had left on a military vehicle. Yifan did not know whether to be happy or sad, but he felt that his heart was about to jump out of his chest.</p>
<p>The next day, the two of them changed to a Xi'an car in a very flustered manner and eloped. At that time, Yifan had completely forgotten about his first sculpture that was about to be published. However, he did not dare to go back to Shanghai, because he was afraid that his father would scold him; however, from then on, he really could not go back, because the news of his elopement with the military officer's wife soon spread in newspapers everywhere, and the sculptor Liu Yifan became a sinner spurned by society. Everyone was ridiculing:</p>
<p>"The subconscious! The subconscious!"</p>

<p>Scrofula</p>
<p>No. 64, Mr. Peng Shuchen from Tongan Lane, Xinma Road, Nanshi asks: A friend's wife is reportedly not virtuous. According to her husband, "A lump has grown where her left leg connects to her lower abdomen, and it is growing larger every day. He immediately asked a Chinese medicine doctor to inject '606,' but the swelling worsened after the injection. The center of the lump has softened." He asks: (1) Is this syphilis? (2) Was there a mistake in the 606 injection? (3) What is a reliable treatment? (4) Does this illness constitute grounds for divorce?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It is not syphilis, it is scrofula. (2) It was already incorrect for the Chinese medicine doctor to inject 606; injecting an anti-syphilis drug into scrofula is completely absurd. (3) The center has softened, indicating it has festered. Please see a doctor to have it incised. Before it festered, injecting Teku-pin and using Mecuary ointment might have reduced it, but that is no longer possible. (4) This is a legal question, so I will not answer it.</p>
<p>Pubic Lice</p>
<p>No. 65, Mr. Sun Xiaobao from Laobaisheng Branch Road, Caojiadu asks: My husband does not behave properly and frequents prostitutes, despite my earnest advice. Two days after intimacy with my husband, my vulva became unbearably itchy, and there are eight-legged lice on my pubic hair, which are impossible to catch all of. There is also something that looks like yellow sand on my pubic hair. Therefore, I ask: (1) What is this illness? (2) Is it related to venereal disease? (3) How can it be cured? (4) What is the yellow sand?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Pubic lice. (2) It comes from unclean sexual intercourse, but it is unrelated to venereal disease. (3) Apply 2% Neochrome. (4) Lice eggs.</p>
<p>Eliminating Roundworms</p>
<p>No. 66, Mr. Duan Jingbi from Zhangjiazhai, Aiwenyi Road asks: My eldest son is five years old this year. Although he eats a lot, he does not gain weight, his complexion is yellow, he is weak, his belly is large, and he often scratches his anus. Sometimes he excretes roundworms that look like fly larvae. The doctor said they were roundworms, so I bought goosefoot and fed it to him. Although he excreted many, he is not completely cured. He asks: (1) Are these roundworms? (2) What medicine is most reliable? (3) Are you confident in treating this disease?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) They are pinworms, not roundworms. (2) Inject Santoninsol and use a 5% Tryierin solution for enemas every day. (3) Yes.</p>
<p>Intending to Quit Opium</p>
<p>No. 67, Mr. Zhang Zhongfu from Yugu Village, Yuwei Road asks: I previously discussed with my friend Mr. Song your methods of quitting opium, and I admire them greatly. I have been trapped by opium for a long time and cannot stop freely. Moreover, the National Government has issued clear orders, so I also intend to ask you to help me escape this bitter sea. However, I have several questions to ask, please reply in detail: (1) I have been using opium for ten years, will there be any problems quitting? (2) I have a history of back pain, will it recur during the quitting period? (3) Is it necessary to inject, and if so, what medicine?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) No problem. (2) Possible. (3) It varies depending on individual constitution, but injecting Antiopin during the quitting period and injecting phosmin after quitting are indispensable.</p>
<p>Brief Answers on Syphilis</p>
<p>No. 68, Answer to Mr. Zhang Anyi from Xiangrui Lane, Haining Road: (1) Gonorrhea and syphilis can be transmitted simultaneously. (2) The small particles are not syphilis or gonorrhea, but red tinea. (3) Blood tests at the health bureau are reliable.</p>
<p>No. 69, Answer to Mr. Wang Jiasen: (1) The lump inside the foreskin is a chancre. Please have a blood test to determine if it is a hard or soft chancre before determining treatment. (2) Treatment is described in (1). It cannot be treated by applying medicine yourself. (3) There is no need to circumcise. (4) It is a type of venereal disease.</p>
<p>No. 70, Answer to Mr. Wu Jiaju: (1) We can perform blood tests here. (2) Using the Kahn test. (3) The fee is two yuan. (4) 914 injections range from three to five yuan, but according to your described symptoms, neurosyphilis will not respond to simultaneous injections of mercury-based "Mersen."</p>
<p>Announcement: In the future, please do not ask in letters how much medicines or injections cost, as it has no value and is not worth a reply.</p>
<p>Brief Answers on Various Illnesses</p>
<p>Too Overweight—No. 71, Ms. Wu Aimei: (1) Excessive eating is related to obesity. When undergoing obesity treatment, the daily caloric intake must be reduced to half of the usual amount. (2) Irregular menstruation is also related to obesity. Please regularly take "Tancno" for treatment. (3) Thyroid tablets can be taken, but only under the supervision and guidance of a doctor, otherwise there are many dangers.</p>

<p>Is Gonorrhea Cured?—No. 73, Mr. Wang Xiaogang, No. 178, Minguo Road: Since there are no gonococci in the urine, the gonorrhea is completely cured. The presence of a single gelatinous globule will not cause the disease to recur.</p>
<p>Asthma—No. 74, Ms. Wang Xiuying, Dusiwei Road: (1) It is "bronchial asthma." (2) Take "Ephedrin Sulphate 'Star Brand'." (3) Ma Bao is an old medicine, I am not familiar with it. (4) Determined after diagnosis. (5) Fees vary among doctors. (6) "Vitamin B" is not only for men, but also for women, and it is often effective. I usually use "Vitamin-b 'Star Bran-d'."</p>
<p>Chancre</p>
<p>No. 75, Mr. Xiao Zhiteng from the Gongyi Yarn Factory, No. 150, Laobosen Road asks: A friend of mine has been misbehaving, and after a night with a prostitute nearby, a red spot appeared on the contact area of his foreskin and glans within a month. It soon ulcerated, making movement difficult. Therefore, he asks: (1) Is it a chancre? (2) Can it heal without treatment? (3) What is the treatment method? (4) Is there any danger if left untreated?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) It is a hard chancre. (2) No. (3) Inject 606 and apply Haibiform locally. (4) This disease is an early symptom of syphilis, so if left untreated, the disease will worsen and enter the second and third stages of syphilis's normal course. It can be a lifelong affliction or even lead to death.</p>
<p>Severe Headache</p>
<p>No. 76, Mr. Huang Qiang from Fuxu Lane, Kader Road asks: My mother is over sixty years old, but her physique is still strong and shows no signs of aging. Her muscles are full. However, she often has headaches, and she says she feels like a pump is pushing inward in her head when the pain occurs. Therefore, I ask: (1) What is the cause? (2) What medicine should she take? (3) What will happen if left untreated?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) High blood pressure, cerebral congestion. (2) Take "Bndojodin." It is best to check blood pressure once before taking it. (3) There is danger if left untreated.</p>
<p>Cessation of Menstruation</p>
<p>No. 77, Mr. Huang Xiangbin, No. 31, Zhongshipi Lane asks: I have a friend Mr. Du who sent a letter from the countryside to ask about his wife's illness. Although I studied medicine, I only specialized in oral medicine, so I cannot answer my friend's questions. Therefore, I am writing to seek your advice. I would be extremely grateful for your guidance. I have excerpted the patient's condition from the letter as follows! Before the illness: The patient married my friend last year. Because the woman's body was weak, and they engaged in excessive sexual activity after marriage, she became ill. Seven or eight hours after intercourse, she feels distension in her lower abdomen and cannot control her urination. What is the reason for this? However, it improves after resting quietly. (2) After two months, her menstruation stopped. Initially, she thought she was pregnant, but there are no signs of pregnancy. It has been stopped for four or five months now. Because there are no good Western doctors in the countryside, she was diagnosed by Chinese medicine doctors, who said it was "due to overwork and emotional stagnation, causing blood stasis." They prescribed strong and hot remedies such as "donkey-hide gelatin," "dried ginger," and "fish roe," but they were ineffective. (According to her, the patient dislikes heat and usually takes cooling remedies.) Now she is mentally weak, dizzy and listless, her abdomen is often distended, she feels chest tightness during movement, and she has dizziness and blurred vision. Later, a Chinese medicine doctor said, "It is due to cold blood in the uterus causing coagulation," and prescribed the same medications as above, and also used two Chinese cotton strips, soaked them in hot water mixed with medicine, and wrapped them around her lower abdomen to increase the temperature of the uterus and melt the blood; as a result, it backfired, causing abdominal pain and diarrhea, making her limbs even weaker. Therefore, I dare to ask: (1) What is the source of the illness? (2) What is the progression? (3) What will be the future outcome? (4) What are the treatment methods? (5) Are there any particularly effective drugs? (6) Can she eat nutritious foods such as chicken, duck, bird's nest, and white fungus? (7) Are there any particularly effective tonics in Western medicine? (Please also specify where to buy them and the price.) (8) What aspects of health preservation should she pay attention to? (9) Please recommend a famous doctor! Answer: (1) The disease is called "Amenorrhea." There are many causes, such as "incomplete development of the uterus or ovaries," "ovarian dysfunction," "chlorosis," "tuberculosis," and "mental illness." It is difficult to generalize, but most cases are due to ovarian dysfunction. (2) With proper treatment, there should be no major problems. (3) See (1) and (2). Abdominal distension after intercourse is common and not a cause for concern. Urinary incontinence is also caused by mental excitement. (4) Oral or injectable "female hormone preparations," such as (Ovarin Substancc) (Because you are a fellow professional, I will not elaborate on the details as I would for a regular patient.) (5) In addition to the above medicine, also take "Tancno," three times a day, one teaspoon each time, until menstruation returns. (6) Yes, but bird's nest and white fungus do not have much nutritional value. (7) "Livemin" and Easton's Syrup. (8) Regulate bowel movements, promote nutrition, engage in appropriate exercise (not too strenuous), reduce sexual activity (once a week or every half month). (9) Gynecologists can all treat this.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>The Hezhong Company Case Occurs Again in Baoyuan</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>According to a Tianjin dispatch, the Hezhong Company case has occurred again in Baoyuan. The case involves two unlicensed Japanese residents, Tanaka Yoshio and Takeda Yoneo, who arrived in Baoyuan on the 8th and bribed a traitorous citizen to rent a house in their name, establishing the Hezhong Company for smuggling and drug trafficking. The landlord, aware of the true situation, feared being punished and reported it to the authorities. The Jin Court sentenced the tenant to imprisonment and ordered Tanaka to vacate the house, but he refused. The court, according to common practice in Chinese lawsuits, sealed the house. Tanaka tore off the seals and complained to the Kono Special Service Agency, protesting. Unlicensed foreign residents arbitrarily bribing traitors in the interior to organize smuggling and drug trafficking agencies has already violated international practice. The court, acting according to common Chinese lawsuit practice, sealed the house, but Tanaka tore off the seals, showing extreme contempt for our national authorities.</p>
<p>Not only is the other party unaware of their wrongdoing, but they have also lodged a serious protest, using the pretext of protecting foreign residents to increase military police deployment. The Japanese military has even stated that if negotiations are unsuccessful, they will take self-defense actions. Is this the explanation of self-defense actions? It is truly a different interpretation, truly unheard of. Ambassador Kawagoe is currently stationed in Beijing, intending to adjust Sino-Japanese relations with our national authorities, but on one hand, they are creating smuggling and drug trafficking incidents in Baoyuan, and on the other hand, they are conducting large-scale military exercises in Pingjin. Therefore, the Washington Post stated that this Japanese maneuver is a military action with a clear purpose, evidently intended to force the Chinese government to accept its demands regarding North China. This maneuver is nothing more than a demonstration of force. The American media's observation is naturally very clear, and can our nation, both government and people, view this action as justified and remain indifferent?</p>
<p>However, international negotiations have their normal course. Assuming there is genuine intention to negotiate through diplomatic channels, there should be no more extraordinary actions in North China. Assuming they wish to take free action by force, they are free to do so, but why must they take the form of negotiations again? On one hand, the envoy is negotiating with our government authorities in Beijing, while on the other hand, they disregard everything and take free action. The complete lack of sincerity in these negotiations is evident. Furthermore, according to yesterday's Tokyo dispatch, the content of the new instructions for Sino-Japanese negotiations brought by Consul General Suma stated that the fundamental spirit of these instructions is that Japan's demands have not changed and that there is no way to deviate from the initially determined goals. If this is the case, then the Japanese side is completely unwilling to compromise, and our country can only devise strategies for self-preservation and self-rescue. Is there any other way out?</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, due to the Spanish Civil War and the increasing power of fascist groups in Europe, Soviet Russia's international position has been greatly weakened. Today, it is preparing a self-defense plan to resist without external assistance. This statement is true. A country cannot rely on others for assistance if it cannot save itself. Our entire population, under this worst of circumstances, should think of self-reliance, self-rescue, and be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for the country. Do not rely on others, and do not fear others. We should respond calmly to overcome this harsh environment and be worthy of being citizens of the Republic of China. Rong</p>
<h3>Real Estate Assessment Association</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>(Inland Correspondence) "Real Estate Assessment Association" is a name coined by the author, because although there are many "public servants" wearing badges on their lapels in the streets and alleys asking house and property owners to fill out a form and appraise the prices of houses and properties, this "public service" agency has not been formally established. Since there is no formal agency, naturally there is no need to pre-announce the name. For the sake of convenience, the author will tentatively call it a "Real Estate Assessment Association." I think that in the future, it will only change a few words. It has been decided that real estate will be evaluated and there is no way to change that.</p>
<p>Our small county town, because of historical reasons, and the existence of a railway line, has become quite "modernized" since several wars. The first change was in clothing. Besides the "local" villagers who work in the fields every day, those living in the city</p>
