<h3>歐局緩和之轉機</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>希特勒片面廢棄羅卡諾公的德軍重行開入萊因河非武裝地帶以禮歐洲和平局勢驟受威脅伕此兩國共同要求國聯對德此種行動加以制止羅卡諾公的其他簽字國家亦願予以援助巴黎會議因而產生但會議兩臼仍無結果於是英國邀請各簽的國及國聯行政院往倫敦開會繼續討論此項問題倫敦會議現已開幕德國接受國聯邀請派里本特洛浦出席而羅卡諾公的簽字國家亦已商得妥協主張互關非武裝區域是則由德國廢的所釀成之嚴重局勢其將由此暫趨緩和歟</p>
<p>歐局之能吾緩和首當視英怯之旨趣如何萊因地帶本為德國領士歐戰援怯國老虎總理曾欲宰割其地創立萊因共和國以為德怯間之緩衛嗣以格於威爾遜主義乃存共名去其實闢為非武裝區域載於和的之內以阻穗國之西使一九二五年英伕意此四國為重行保瞪此項條欺之有效起見簽訂羅卡諾公的由德國再度承認奪重萊因河地帶之非武裝區城自此以援法國以萊因邊界不我再受德國威脅對該處之防禦工事與動員計劃即不谷注意今德國擅自廢的進兵萊因鈇國東攬國防威受重大威脅其皇皇不可終日而堅持亟須有以制止者乃勢所當然英國保守鐵本惜恨蘇聯自握政權以來即揚德抑怯對以「防蘇」相標情者恆予以便利希特勒固亦以「防蘇」之先鋒自號其能得英保守黨之靑陳亦勢所使然去年英德海軍協定成立德國海軍力量增加「納粹」黨人大有一試身手於波羅的海之意此决德國廢的英國又自始主張由羅卡諾公的簽字國家與德談判以避免制裁緩和局勢其袒德之心愈益顯著而意國復乘機要挾倡言反對制裁法國在此種國際形勢之下自難堅持其對篠制裁之主張歐局之所以可望暫趨緩和者此其一因</p>
<p>其决歐洲各小國之態度對於歐局亦大有關係西歐之比國與德國接壤其因穗國進兵萊因所受之影響與怯國一致其態度自屬親伕瑞士興荷蘭雖向守中立但扳以德國之軍事訐劃頗有假道進襲鈇此之勢對德廢的當不致澳視小偽的國本為伕國之與國其惜德親鈇殊無疑義巴爾幹協的各國除小協的中之羅南兩國外尚有希臘與士耳其希臘固惟英之馬首是瞻而士耳共則與蘇聯邦交數陸更鑒於德國東進政策對德亦了無好戚中歐之奧國素反德國態度芸為明瞭惟甸牙利與巴爾幹之保加利亞則仍親德至於波蘭雖與德國締有十年互不侵氾條的但兩國間之關係尚未臻發盡善而波蘭政府最扳向伕大使表示將竭力履行怯波聯盟下之義務或可謬為波蘭政府轉向之預示準此以觀歐洲各小國在希特場片面廢的之下顯有團結一我以對德國之勢此决德國竟能接受國聯邀請出席行政院會議未始非由於周圍環攬之影響歐局之所以可望暫趨緩和老此其二因</p>
<p>由上以觀德國廢的所引起之歐洲嚴重局勢或可因國際蘭係之趨化而暫趨緩和矣然吾人於此實尚不能無戚往者日本違反華盛頓公的而進兵東北四省僅獲國際道義上之譴責其援意國違反國聯盟的于·十一·十五諸條而稱兵東菲僅獲不澈底之制裁今者德國遠反羅卡諾公的而又不但未受制裁反有相與妥協之機會今世之國際公的其尚有奪嚴可言乎</p>

<h3>國聯行政院通過　譴責德國違反條約　德國代表出席侃侃而談　羅卡諾公約國成立協定　德方認為難作談判基礎</h3>
<p>倫敦　國聯行政院在德總代表陳述後、今日下午一致通過法比斥責德國毀背羅卡諾公約與凡爾賽和約之動議、獨德國投不同意票、但其票不生效、厄爪多缺席、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　羅卡諾公約各簽字國代表、頃於本日午後二時開會、對於各該國擬向國聯會行政院提出之建議案、即關於德國違反條約之善後辦法、頃已成立妥協、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日宣布羅卡諾公約簽字國、即英·法·比·意·四國對於德國片面廢止羅卡諾公約並派兵重佔萊茵地非武裝區域所引起之各問題、已商妥協定、其辦法如下、</p>
<p>（一）法俄互助協定提交海牙國際法庭判決其否與羅卡諾公約相牴</p>
<p>（二）在德國邊界關非武裝區域、其警務由國際警隊担任、（英國建議非武裝區域應關入法比兩國、但法國反對此議、因照此實行、則法國須將其鞏固之邊防工程拆毀也、）</p>
<p>（三）英法兩國參謀部共籌保衛邊界之計畫、</p>
<p>據公報宣稱、羅卡諾公約國昨夜十時在英外部開會、至今日上午二時始散、草定上述之協定、惟其中尚須作某項保留、而須續加討論、此項保留多關於英法軍事當局在法德邊界所應施之計畫者、羅卡諾公約國今日將再集議、協商此協定之細則、但須先得英法政府之認可、而後始能實施、此協定告成之消息、已使緊張空氣大為和緩、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德人方面以為此協定所載之談判根據、未必可為希特勒所贊同、尤其是規定以國際警隊佔領德國邊界二十公里區域之第二點、蓋德國官場已發完全不能接受此點之批評也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>德代表向國聯　宣布廢約理由　獨立國主權不容受限制　法俄互助條約危害德國</h3>
<p>倫敦　今晨十時三十分、國聯行政院在非公開會議後、舉行公開會議、德總代表里賓特辦浦將軍曾發表長篇演說、陳述德國所以片面廢止羅卡諾公約及派軍重佔萊茵非武裝區域之理由、里氏演說畢、即延會至午後三時、俾他國代表獲發言之機會、開會之初、德代表即起立發言、希望德國與國聯關係之恢復、得為歐戰後沉　多年經過多重紛亂之歐洲歷史上一大轉機、</p>
<p>繼謂德國對於羅卡諾公約之根本態度、已於三月七日經希特勒說明、該約之主要特點、厥為防止法比一方面與德國一方面需用武力、簽字各國曾以担負加於德國、而使地位重要戶口繁盛之萊茵區無任何軍事上之保護、就公道立場而言、對一國主權加此限制、終將為一國所不能容忍之條件、</p>
<p>里氏次　舉德國反對法俄互助條約之理由如下、</p>
<p>該條約後共有二萬七千五百萬人民之兩國相結合、</p>
<p>兩締約國各具有世界上甚強厚之軍力</p>
<p>該約專事防禦德國、</p>
<p>蘇俄與德國隔離甚遠、德國不能攻擊之、既與捷克締結軍事聯盟、則其界綫間接連於德國邊陲、</p>
<p>法俄兩國成此條約後、可自為自己案件之裁判人、蓋彼等可隨意指任何國為侵略國、而不必經國聯為之也、</p>
<p>里氏於是申述第五點、並德國認此條約為不合法之理由、謂法俄互助條約之第一欵、使法國能決定德國或蘇俄是否為侵略國、並附有一種保留、法國得依其自己決議、作軍事佈置、而不受羅卡諾公約担保國即英意兩國所施之制裁計劃、此種保留、在法律上與事實上實不能有效、因法國欲預知担保國之態度、實不可能也、德國對於該約所以恐慌者、一國在加於國聯所指為侵略國之制裁中、得到其權利上之小安慰、而已為勢力絕大之軍事聯盟國所攻擊矣、此種極大之聯盟、自東亞而達英吉利海峽者、有何制裁能打擊之乎、兩國如此龐大、而在國聯中復為有裁決力之會員、更在軍事上為有力分子、就實際言、欲施以制裁、實為不可思議之事也、</p>
<p>里氏於是詢問行政院、德政府既簽定羅卡諾公約、倘發見一種情勢、使德國獨肩担負、如後此所發見者、德政府仍須履行該約之義務、其在情理中乎、德法兩國既因羅卡諾公約而在彼此關係中放棄其武力、但若對法俄互助條約、乃一方面所成立軍事性質互助新義務以防他方面者之解釋、在德政府之堅決信念與公道解釋中、實為絕對不可能之事、如在羅卡諾公約締結時有此見解、則締約國方面責當注意及此、果爾、則羅卡諾公約永不能成立矣、法國所稱法俄為抵制德國重整軍備起見、兩國不得不成此協定、此說顯屬錯誤、蓋羅卡諾公約規定恢復法德兩國間、軍事平等、因其結尾之議定書、曾確定法國與其他各國踵行德國軍　之義務也、德國因法國拒絕依此方法恢復平等、乃迫不得已、依自己之途徑、告成平等、而達羅卡諾公約之目的、德國未締結任何種之軍事聯盟、德國屢向法國作和平之貢獻、而皆為法國拒絕或漠視之、法國既批准法俄條約、希特勒乃採行唯一可能之行動、而恢復德國在其全部領土之完全主權、德政府對於德國片面破壞羅卡諾公約之責言、認為不正確、且不公道、而駁斥之、蓋羅卡諾公約實為法國行為註銷無效也、</p>
<h3>德國不願　訴諸世界法庭　法俄條約與羅卡諾　是否觸尚待决定</h3>
<p>以言法國提議法俄互助條約提交國際法庭公斷一節、則渠有一言足以答之、即此問題除純粹法律方面外、尚有甚重大之政治意味、其實際上之解決、非可求諸法庭是也、如欲以簽字國之談判澄清此事、則德政府更未能行其成功、渠作此言、誠為扼腕、已往之經　已證明依此辦法之舉動、從未達到切實之目的、以言將來、則德國主權既已及於其全境矣、平等既已成就矣、</p>
<h3>德國準備　與法棄嫌修好　藉以改造歐洲和平</h3>
<p>德國現願意並準備終止關於法律精神中錯誤之可憾的一頁史、羅卡諾公約消滅後、德國人民乃釋其精神上與政治上之重負、德國人民現願與其隣邦其處於和平與友誼中、並就其能力所及、從事於歐洲真正團結之改造工作、德國決計將來以充分主權國與外國締造條約、自由而不受束縛、藉以終止法德間之緊張、德元首已以此種精神對歐洲和平提出歷史上空前之貢獻矣、其內容與德國建議之實施、無需批評、其中包含甚廣、凡以歐洲幸福為懷之各政治家、皆願見其以一種方式或他種方式實現之云、</p>
<p>里氏演說時、會場景象、甚為嚴肅里氏服裝、純屬黑色、為最先抵聖哲姆斯宮諸代表之一、即由主席卜魯斯迎見之、迨宣布開會、德代表均就席、里氏突見法外長佛蘭亭、即步至圓案前、佛氏乃起立、而相握手、繼意總代表駐倫敦大使格蘭第與德諸代表握手、里氏發言頗捷、佛蘭亭倚椅背而坐、目注天花板、格蘭第則交臂而坐、而呈從容鎮定之象、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>國聯行政院　前日開會情形　意表示實踐羅卡諾義務</h3>
<p>倫敦　國聯會行政院於午後三時四十五分、舉行非公開會議、先將本日會議程序、予以決定、嗣於四時舉行公開會議、主席澳洲代表勃魯斯、當由英·意·波蘭·西班牙·丹麥·羅馬尼亞·與葡萄牙七國代表相繼發表演說、至午後六時散會、並定於明晨十時繼續開會、至德國代表里本特洛甫、則於午後五時十分始行趕到倫敦、不及參加會議、故由德國大使館秘書希登、以觀察員資格列席旁聽、茲將各國代表演詞、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>英國艾登最先發言、略謂「凡爾賽和約關於萊茵河非武裝區域之條欵、已遭破壞、事實具在、不容否認、此際言人所負職責、既極艱辛、其所可產生之後果、又極嚴重、則應付之際、不可不審慎將事也、惟是現行局勢、包含兩種要素、吾人為緩和人心與建設和平而工作、自可予以利用、要素維何、即（一）違約行為、雖極顯著、但不致立即引起戰事威脅、而羅卡諾公約所規定應在某種情形之下、加以援引之條文、亦毌須立即援引之、以故吾人　可乘審慎與果斷之態度而從容有所作為、（二）任何局勢縱使嚴重、亦必留有機會、可資利用是也」、艾登嗣謂、國聯會行政院當以盟約全部條欵作為南針、俾就各種觀點、考慮現行局勢、蓋行政院固有此權利、抑亦職責所在也、「吾人務當設法維持和平、且當更進一步而使戰爭之可怖幻象、今後不復現於吾人眼前、為達到此項目的起見、各種方法均當研究、蓋時至今日、國際信心已大為動搖、全體國家均應通力協作、以冀恢復信心、建樹安全制度、此在吾等國家同係西歐大國、尤為當仁不讓也」云云、</p>
<p>意大利駐英大使格蘭第繼起發言、謂德國在萊茵河沿岸重行設防一舉所產生之問題、應按照理性求覓解決、而不可徒尚感情、「惟是違約行為、出於泱泱大國之手、而為奠定和平發揮文化、該國之合作又屬不可或缺、此則吾人所尤為感慨不已者也、意國對於所負責任完全了解、茲願遵守各項義務」、格蘭第嗣述及意國所受制裁辦法、謂意國一方面係被制裁之國、另一方面則係羅卡諾公約之担保國、此兩地位未免矛盾、應請行政院注意、「夫意何爭端、僅係殖民地事件、其意義原不應過於擴大、何期歐洲和平、竟一度繋於此案、國聯會對於意國所採決定、足使羅卡諾公約之政治基礎、為之削弱、此實促成現行局勢主要原因之一也」、格蘭第繼又　請各國、證明其善良意志、庶幾「建設和平猶有一綫之望」、最後格蘭第說明歐洲得以措於磐石之安、意國過去功績亦足多者、並謂「一般人對於已往種種、似均不予注意、今後建設事業、務當以下列兩項為本、即　民族生命之需要、各國應相互了解而予以尊重、　各國對於現代文化之權利利益與義務所抱觀念、應歸統一是也」云、</p>
<p>波蘭外交部長柏克上校、對於德國違反條約在萊茵河沿岸非武裝區重行設防之事、主張由行政院予以登記、並由羅卡諾公約各簽字國加以審核、並謂羅卡諾公約簽訂之際、原非波蘭所歡迎、但波蘭仍承認該公約係在法波兩國盟約範圍之內、迨一九三四年一月、波蘭與德國簽訂互不侵犯條約、乃係以相互尊重與和平願望作為基礎、以樹立兩國間之關係、至波蘭根據以前各項協定（指法波盟約等而言）所負義務、亦不以法俄互助公約之訂立而有所變更、此後波蘭又與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約、其目的係使東歐和平臻於穩固、此際波俄兩國善鄰關係、仍以此項條約為歸、」柏克結論謂、任何事件凡與某一國家之利益有關者、則討論之際、自應由該國參預其事也云云、</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥、以小協商各國名義發言、謂在現行形勢之下、國聯會一旦失敗、則集體安全制度即將夭折、又謂羅卡諾公約雖由德國加以腹止、但就英法比意四國言之、固繼續有效也云云、葡萄牙外長蒙德羅最後發言、對於蒂社樓斯哥所言、加以贊助、行政院旋即散會、（十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>先講太乾的補救方法，就是灌溉，這偭問題可分爲灌溉的方法，和灌溉後土壤中所起的變化兩層。液溉的方法很多，一種是引水灌溉，這是引高處的河流以液溉低地，我國的涇惠渠就是用這個方法，現在已經有很大的成功。同時在陜西叉有許多別的渠，像洛惠渠，渭惠渠，不久都可以成功了。第二種是積水灌溉，積水的意思，是在高的地方，或者山裏築一個壩，將水堵住了，而且把水位提高，如是就可以居高臨下的灌溉。再有一種是抽水液溉，是將低處的水抽到高處，作爲灌溉之用。至於抽水的方法，在美國有的地方是用洋鐵水管子，在我們中國沒有這種水管子，都是用渠，渠的組織，往往有幹渠，幹渠旁邊再有許多支渠，農家就想法將支渠裏的水，引到他們的地上。還有一種是鑒井，在河北省的南部，利用井水灌溉的地方很多，他們費三四十塊錢鑒一個井，在兩三年以內，便可將本錢拿回來。井的種類又有兩種，一種是土井，一種是洋井，他們的不同的地方，就是土井淺一些，洋井深一些；土井是用本地的水，洋井大都是用遠地方的水；費用方面，土井便宜，洋井較貴。此外太乾的地方，有時候可以利用耐旱的植物，然而這也有限制，如果雨量在三百　以下，無論如何總是不行的。至於太濕的土地，如果水可以留得住，那麽栽水稻最好，吾則，可以用排水的方法，將水排出。排水的方法有兩種，一種是用陰溝的方法，一種是用陽溝的方法，用陰溝排水的地方，在我們中國是沒有聽到過。用陽溝排水則很普通。排水的組織和灌溉的組織，採同樣一個原理，都是利用水從高處流到低處去的作用。</p>
<p>改良山地的第一步手續，是要阻止冲蝕的作用。所謂「冲蝕」是指表土受雨水的冲洗而流失。要防止道樣的冲蝕，最好的方法是使這處土地不呈坡形，然一下子將高的地挖平，低的地塡高，事實上是辦不到，而且對於土壤也是不合宜的。所以造梯形地的方法，也只能慢慢的將地形改變。如果將山地的地形改變不容易辦到，最好讓這塊地方長草，好的草，所獲的利息也不差，如果要種糧食的話，至少不要上下耕，要橫着耕。山地的另一個毛病，是缺乏蓄水的能力，要增加蓄水的能力，一方面應當深耕，一方面應當增加腐植質，因爲腐植質可以蒂水，同時也可以抵抗冲蝕的作用。</p>
<p>太鬆的土是缺乏粘土，那麽，補救的方法，是增加粘土，這個方法很合實用。我們有幾個例可以看看在河南的北部有一個地方，原來是很肥的粘質土，自從經過黃河泛濫之後，面上蓋了很深的一層砂子，現在在這邊種地的人，往往挖一條五六尺深的溝，以挖到粘土爲止，再將底下的粘土運到砂面上，然後塡沒了這條溝，在旁邊再挖，道樣繼續的挖，繼續的塡，那邊的沙土就變成很好的地了。復决，粘土不一定要在底下挖起來，在武昌附近，也有許多砂土，就利用附近小河裏的泥塡在面上，他們的結果也很好。砂土用這種方法改良了以後，往往成爲很好的土壤。這一類土的質地很鬆而且有相當的粘性，種蔬菜是特別合宜，做果園，苗圃也很相宜。這一種改良土壤的方法看起來是很笨，而實際上的效用却很大。在江蘇的盬墾區，也有翻土的方法，那是將底下鹽分少一些的土翻到面上來。兄弟在三個月以前在歐洲匈牙利也看到同樣的專實。所不同的，他們翻土的理由是有另外一種作用罷了。至於太粘的土，照理論上講應當加砂，然而事實上兄弟却沒有見過，也沒有聽過，這個原因，大概是因爲粘土多的地方，往往沒有砂；就是有少量的砂，也不中用，不像砂土裏邊加一些粘土，便可以有很大的改變。依兄弟所想到的，如果這種地方的水可以積起來，應當種水稻，不過較小的地方，像種蔬菜，花卉一類的植物，所需要的土地，不到兩三畝，那麽，加砂也行。除却加砂以外，改良粘土的方法，還可以加充分的腐植質，腐梳質的性質可以使得粘土變鬆，太鬆的土如果加了充分的腐植質，也可以使得牠變得粘一些，並且腐植質不僅可以改變太粘太鬆的性質，同時也是很好的肥料。廐肥，人糞，堆肥種種，都是腐械質，又太粘的土往往阻止水分的排泄，所以這樣的土往往太濕。利用排水的方法，也是改良粘土的一種辦法</p>
<p>改良土壤下邊有硬磐的方法，要看磐的種類而定。就大體而論，磐有兩種，一種是因爲底下一層，粘土很多，卽所調粘土磐。一種是因爲上邊滲據下去的物質，到底下的時候，起了化學作用而沈澱，因此就把沈澱的一層土壤結成一種磐層，這種磐層，有的時候很硬，像石塊一樣。對付這樣的磐層的方法，在美國種果樹的地，有時候用炸藥把牠炸碎了，然後再種。不過使用炸藥的方法碰到粘土的磐層，便沒有用了。因爲粘土磐在炸的時候，雖然碎了，但在下雨以後又固結起來，像道樣的土，只好種淺根的作物。而不能期望牠成爲一個頂好的土壤。此外，土壤太簿也是沒有辦法，只能種淺根的植物，或者讓牠長草，希望牠慢慢的將腐爛的草積聚起來，再加以風化的作用，使牠變深一些，至少也應當使得這層薄土，不要再遺失了。兄弟曾經在江西的東北部分，看到許多地方，最初是土壤薄，沒有長作物，後來這薄薄的土也遺失了，現在所見的都是石層，這種情形，須要幾千年才可以恢復，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>天生土壤的第五種是土壤的鈉化作用，這個問題講起來是很長，今天只能很簡單的講一講。鈉化土所以壞的原因，是由於土壞裏含有食鹽，食鹽留在土裏的時候旣久，鹽裏的鈵質和土起了化學作用，那麽這塊土的性質就更壞了。改良這種土壤的方法，第一，截止鹽的來源。第二，减少土裏邊的鹽分。第三，如果土壤中的鈉質和土起了化學作用，那麽，一定要把這些鈉取出來。</p>
<p>兄弟這兩天的所購的土壤改良法，內容很廣泛，差不多已經把最顯著的幾種影響土壤的因子都包括在內。一塊土壤的不好，不一定什麽因子都有，有一個兩個不好的因子已經够受了。諸位如果遇有實際問題的時候，第一先認淸不良的因子，將這幾個因子分析一下，應當適應的，便設法週應；可以改良的，便從事改良。有時候適應和改良，可以同時進行。如是，土壤的性質，自然好了。</p>
<p>最後，諸位要記得，一種土壤，必定有一種最經濟的利用方法，而這種利用的方法，不僅隨土壤本身爲轉移，而且要看各種環境而定。我們必須首先對環境加以仔細的考査和研究，然後才可以成功。</p>

<h3>高橋財政後的馬塲財政</h3>
<p>— 東京通信</p>
<p>日本二·二六事變後、產生了現在的廣田內閣、而支持廣田內閣的中心力量、就是馬塲財政、</p>
<p>日本社會經濟政治的矛盾、由二·六事變可以說明、不過這種矛盾的實質、在這裏且不要分析牠、這裏要特別指出的一點、卽對於國際戰爭的積極準備、日本自二·二六事變後、就更加强化了、此决二·二六事變的結果、使岡田內閣、不能不歸於解體、但新內閣的總理大臣不是別人、而就是岡田內閣時曾經主張「國際貿易自由」確定「對華三大原則」的廣田外相、由廣田外相變為廣田內閣、在對內對外政策上、並沒有根本的變動、變動的主點、是岡田內閣還有三分不受軍部的指揮、廣田內閣是完全聽軍部指揮的、當廣田要拜受組閣大命的時候、只因為軍部提出「廣田對於非常時局的認識不足」一語、於是廣田內閣流產說便在各報紙的號外上喧騰起來了、一直到廣田表示完全接受軍部的指導時、廣田內閣才得成立、因此、現在廣田對於非常時局的認識、當然可以說是很充分而非不足的了、因為他已同意國防强化。產業張化。戰爭的準備張化了、但是此等　化、怎樣才能完成呢、强化的基礎、當然是日本的財政經濟、因此今日的馬塲財政、便成為了各方注意的焦點、馬塲决不是一個平常的小民、他原是日本勸業銀行總裁、貴族院議員、以及所謂財政通、而現在更是廣田內閣中的財政大臣、在馬塲的聲明中、最重要的中心點、是樹立打開非常時局的財政政策、在此非常時局下、國防强化的實行、是毫無疑義的、所謂國防强化、主要的當然就是海陸空軍的强化了、但國防强化、就必須要有强化國防的財源、然則馬塲將用什麼方法才能籌出此種浩大的國防强化費用呢、此種浩大的軍費、文將要呌那些人們去負擔呢、</p>
<p>在二·二六事變中犧牲的前　高橋財政大臣、會主張公債漸减、並認為增稅的時機未至、而今日的馬塲財政、恰和高橋財政對立、馬塲主張增稅、改革稅制、同時認為債可以增發、增稅和增發公債、便是新財源籌出的一個主要方法、財源籌出的方法、和被加重負擔的人們、都是已經决定了、只不過具體的條文還未發表、但馬塲財政、自本月九日發出聲明後、而具體條文還未發表的這幾天、惹起了財界的非常變動、第一、三月十一日、一般的股票價共跌落三億五千萬元、第二、軍需工業、尤其是造船工業的股票、非常暴騰、這變動說明了甚麼呢、第一說明這變動是一部份大資產層和中小資產層對於統制經濟的反動、由國防强化的財政政策、必然走上軍事的經濟政治的統制、此種統制經濟、是資本主義發展到國際戰爭前夜的一種經濟組織、同時也更是資本更集中的一種經濟組織、在此種統制經濟下、一部份資產家的自由和利潤、必受到强制、股票跌價的主因之一、就是對此强制的預防的抗爭、同時也就說明了市民對於增稅的恐怖、第二說明、國際政治的危機更深化了、此種危機將使國外塲更加縮少、而國內市塲的出路、只有般的軍需工業、所以軍需工業的股票暴騰、而其他却都有跌落的傾向、</p>
<p>這一變動、母寗說是一部份財界在對馬塲財政的示威、但此種示威、當然是不能持久的、因國防及產業强化的基礎、已經被確定而且被公認了、昭和十二年度以後的日本軍事預算、當然大膨脹、這是毫無疑問的、當財界開始發生巨變時、馬塲却曾對財界聲明、他的政策、决不給財界以急激的打擊、換言之、卽雖則增稅、但對財界的利益、是必定尊重的、這再三的聲明、當然又是在想緩和一部份財界之反抗的、</p>
<p>目前對於日本農村經濟的凋零、以及勞動問題、馬塲雖沒有提到、但在求國民生活的安定一點上、已經表示注意到了、為求國內政治的安定、多使較下層的國民加重負擔、是不大合算的、（雖然在事實上不能不加重）、那末結果仍然是一面行着國內增稅、而最主要的一面、却是使財政政策和軍事政策並駕齊驅、同向國外求急激的發展、</p>
<p>在今日意阿戰爭還未結束、希特勒突然占據非武裝地帶的萊茵沿岸、馬塲財政呢、當然是站在東方的進軍喇叭後、作　極的軍需佈置、（三月四日石莫）</p>

<h3>漢粵紀行（九）</h3>
<p>（本報記者旅行通信）　自樂昌至廣州</p>
<p>到樂昌後，車站上有一事可紀者，卽所有脚夫，女子佔三分之二，男子反寥寥無幾。女脚夫泰半赤足，壯健逾恒，挑數十公斤之行李，若無所事者。此等情狀，匪特江浙所絕無，卽在北方，亦從未見過，男女平等，應從工作平衡入手，女脚夫眞可貴矣。</p>
<p>粵漢路株韶段工程，原自廣東之韶州起，至湖南之株州止，惟韶州至樂昌間工程（卽第一總段），早已竣事，卽移交廣韶路局接管，故余等現在至樂昌，可謂為株韶段工程局之終點，亦卽廣韶段路局之起點也。余儕在湘省境內自長沙至小塘（湘粵邊界），一路與各種人物接談，言語絕無隔　，嗣入粵境之坪石，已微感扞格，直至樂昌，乃完全廣東化，言語旣苦未相通，遂不得不大做手勢，作啞旅行矣，所幸株韶局稽查何景崇君伴余等至廣州，充作舌人，方無困　。</p>
<p>樂昌為北江大邑，馬路多係水門汀，猶無人力車，往來惟恃徒步。從車站至市廛，的十分鐘卽達，第一觸於目者為烟館之多，若白雲烟館，若雲霞戒烟室，幾於望衡對宇，所在皆是。此外銀牌番攤，亦到處可見。菜館之中，且盛行女招待，門首張鉅板，大書一新到省港女職工」，以為號召，所謂省港者，係指廣州香港而言，一若江浙內地，認蘇滬女子為最時髦者也。此間娼妓，亦復盛行，妓多寓花舫上，與江山船彌復相似，水上笙管嗷嘈，凡喜徵逐者，多於此駐足焉。入慕，余等由何君導往粵漢酒店，係樂昌最大之旅館，而汚穢特甚，二樓為菜室，往來雜沓，旅館部份，在三樓四樓，因無電火，煤氣燈强烈刺眼，鄰室終宵雀戰，嘻笑怒駡並作，雖不解何語，以意度之，殆輸贏結賬之局面耳。</p>
<p>自此赴粵，須換毫洋票，樂昌　肆，對中國銀行之法幣，最樂於承受，而兌價亦較高，其他各銀行之法幣，雖亦承兌，但價格每元相差一毫之鉅，行旅者幸注意及之。</p>
<p>樂昌駐兵甚多，而紀律極佳，兵士間有冶游者，長官伺於門外，俟其出而就地笞其臀，圍觀者衆，兵士赧顏，遂不敢再往，懲一儆百，乃絕妙絕趣之方法也。</p>
<p>十日晨，黎明起程，卽趨車站，車站附近，號角大鳴，兵士方在操演，粵省治軍之動，於此可見。七時，廣韶段火車開行，至午後四時抵廣州。</p>
<p>至廣州後，余等以一日之光陰，參觀各處名勝，最令余感喟者，為新建之十九路軍抗日紀念碑，徘徊瞻眺，未忍卽去。第二日，乘廣九車至香港，復由港往澳門及石岐小游，過翠亨村，謁總理故居。十四日自港乘傑佛遜總統輪，於十六日歸滬。綜余自上月廿八日離滬至歸來時止，共十八日，歷時雖暫，而所得之兒聞，乃至有興會，旅行為活動之學校，非虛語也。</p>

<h3>上海之魚鮮業　（三）　中國微信主編　（上海工商業概况之十八）</h3>
<p>五。實業部創設之上海魚市場，從前節觀察，吾人可知魚鮮之市價，變化甚速，漲落甚大，對於一般漁民及市民，均極不利，同時外貨傾銷，利權外溢，亦為一嚴重問題，實業部因有鑒於此，乃於民國二十三年春開始籌備上海魚市場，以謀對外對內之統制與調整。惟因經費關係，遷延二年，目下大體已吿完成，四月初且可正式開幕矣，今將其各項情形介紹於次。</p>
<p>上海魚市場之地址，為楊樹浦路底定海橋北哩許，介於市中心區及公共租界之間，佔地的四十餘畝，沿浦一帶計長六百零一呎，建造碼頭五座。所建房屋，計有三層樓辦公室一，上加三層之瞭望台一，競賣場一，經紀人辦公處數十幢，冷藏庫與自來水塔各一，均用鋼骨水泥建造。冷藏庫占地計一，七八八·八八立方尺，內設冷庫五間，製冰廠一，並有機器房辦公室等，其冷藏室內足供藏魚一千五百噸。魚市場之資金定為一百萬元，其中九十萬元將耗於開辦費用，如建築生財等，其餘十萬元則為流動資金，預計每年盈餘可達二十餘萬元。舊式魚行，因該魚場一旦實現，必受相當影響，故要求百萬資金各出一半，作為官商合辦，實部因經費關係，亦同意合辦原則，惟一般冰鮮漁商則加反對，要求實部維持國營（三月五日冰鮮漁商同人公益社，曾備文呈　實部，披陳緣由，詳細精參閱三月六日申報）。此乃魚市場內部問題，無關該場前途之發展也。（完）</p>

<p>「啊，可是你最先是取笑那個意思的，直到現在還要取笑我和我的那些意思。你不是預料男女同學一定是一敗塗地的嗎？可是現在你看結果多麼好；」她於是指點到這一羣童子男女在一同跳舞，唱歌和談話。一種投契的情形是最顯明沒有的了。</p>

<h3>舊情</h3>
<p>— 全衡</p>
<p>已經是好幾天以前的事情了。辦公處的聽差給我帶來一張會客單子，對於這個來到了半年而始終沒半個客人也沒封信札的孤獨的女孩子底有人訪問，我瞧見他的眼睛里露着驚奇，疑慮的光芒。</p>
<p>我底心也驀地一怔，不是奇異有客人來訪問，而是驚奇着我的地址怎麽會給人知道，這半年，爲了自己的工作，爲了不給人家過度的注意，不論在親戚朋友中間，我是輕易不吐露半個關於我個人的生活的字的。</p>
<p>來客倒底怎麼會曉得我在這里吃飯的呢，我禁不住由驚訝轉成坦心了。</p>
<p>我端詳着手里的會客單子，那上面，清清楚楚的寫着兩個秀麗的字，「之榕」，這名字對於我實在是驀生的，我想過了我記憶中的熟識的朋友，我底許多朋友們中間都沒有這樣一個名字，然而，再細細的察看一下字跡，這字跡我彷佛在那里會經看過，不，這字跡應該是我以前頂熟識的朋友寫下來的，不然，爲什麼它一刺進我的眼廉，就喚回了我腦海里已經迷糊了的影子呢？</p>
<p>「是華？難道華會來看我？不會的，我們是巳爲着所走的路不同而分手了。」</p>
<p>懷着忐忑的心，昌着險（照理我是不應冒失地跑出去見客的）我踽踽地跟着聽差的指引，跑到會客室里來。</p>
<p>「宜，你好？」是那樣爽脆的聲音，半年以前咱們在學校里時候，我連做夢也沒有想到這粗魯的聲音會得從溫柔得像三月星的春風的華底喉嚨里發出來的，筆直地矗立在我前面的是一個換了樣子的青年。</p>
<p>「啊！是你，華！」我驚叫了起來，一個一辯因爲各人的憧憬兩樣而疏淡，甚致輕蔑的槍尖現在反轉來刺自己的心了，我感到內疚，或者說是羞慚，我看錯了人；而華，這個我可以發誓在她的身上再也找不到半點舊的影子的姑娘，她的大而黑的手掌早已把我下垂着的右手拉了起來，握得那樣緊緊地。</p>
<p>「宜，你找得我好苦，我在家一聽見你跑上海便馬上跟着來，我想你是會跑到你常說的應該去的地方去的，我跑到那里去找你，沒有，我想盡方法探聽你的踪跡，也沒有，然而，我總堅信著你一定在上海，我相信宜不是那麽一個容易回過頭來的人，直到前天，在一個地方我終於看到你了，宜，你不會相信在那許多另一類型的人中間，有着一個人是華，我用着那樣親密的眼光注射着你，我的心是怎樣的激動着，眼眶里幾乎進出淚水來，宜，我知道跑到這地方來看你，也許對你是有不利的，可是，熱情使得不顧一切地冒著險，我一定得來看看你，我有許多話要跟你說，我們離開了巳經半年。」</p>
<p>使勁地搖動着我的手，用着很大的力氣。</p>
<p>「我們離開了已經半年，」這句話重重地釘在我心上，半年里我做了些什麽出來？我拋下了走路時頂親密的伴侶，我虛驕地拿理由來保護我的週身，我這樣沒有勇氣的人，我是不配領受朋友們的充滿着熱與愛的心的！</p>
<p>我得給自己嚴重的懲罰，只有毫不掩飾地剝下自己的外套來才對得住我的朋友們，是的，我得這樣做，從今以後我不好好地邁開着大步走路便算不得是個人！</p>
<p>看着我不響，華以爲我心里在想着什麽事，轉低了聲音說：「宜，爲什麽不開口？我們同有着一個太陽，我們同向着太陽走，爲什麽聽見了我也那麽高高興興地趕路反而不高興了呢？」這樣說着，還是筆直的矗立在我的前面，像一座荘嚴無比的實塔。</p>
<p>我笑了，我大聲地笑了，只有瘋狂的笑聲才能掩蓋掉我心里的痛苦的自責，我應該觀喜我給一個朋友有力地從快要吞噬掉自己的陷穽里拉了回來，這個朋友就是被我輕輕地掉下過的筆。</p>
<p>在當時，我只這樣想：「失去一個朋友算得什麽呢？失去一個像華樣的朋友正像廣漢的砂海里給狂風捲去了粒砂子一樣。」</p>
<p>現在，我們的先生底話又在我耳邊響起來了，我記得不錯，那個時候正是我們爲着要求眞理而掀起了一個巨大的浪潮的時候，我們瘋狂地拋下了自己的學業，時間，精力，來爭取自由，我們要給後來的姊妹們開闢一條平坥的道路，可是，我們的結果是在猛鷹的巨爪下犧牲了。眞理給埋葬着，我們詛咒眞理，我們也詛咒每一個人！</p>
<p>在被迫着離開女師的最後一天，先生的顫巍的身影在我們面前出現了。他說：「孩子們！千萬不要爲了一點小的挫折就垂頭喪氣啊！一粒砂子是堆不起實塔來的，你們不能放鬆，你們之間是應該黏得緊密的。」</p>
<p>我第一人個否認了先生的話，我第一個拋下了舊情，丟却了一切希望。</p>
<p>華也笑着，臉上露着光輝。「坐下吧」，到現在我才想着我們是應該坐下來後談個痛快的，我要把我自己的缺點，錯誤歴陳在華的前面，讓她給我嚴厲的批判。</p>
<p>誰說感情之錬不能縛住兩個已經分開了的行人的腳呢？只要里面多滲人堅硬的鐲，我們的頭頂上有着同一的光明的太陽，在這樣好的太陽光底下，我們有什麽理由不走一條道路，爲着我們的工作與事業，而一定要隔着小渓溝相互不理睬呢？</p>
<p>舊情使我與奮得臉頰都紅了起來。</p>
<h3>垂死者底主張</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>七八十個男男女女被長期的水災逼着從自己的村荘逃到一個山崗上面了。他們在那裹過着飢寒，疾病，非常痛苦的生活，等待自己的末日。走開和牢守的意見兇狠地在人羣中交戰着。以爲後者對的人數還比較多，他們不能夠離開這包含他們全部氖物的被淹沒了鄕村，雖沒有計算過自己還能夠餓着病着過幾天，但他們相信水是終歸要退回河裹去的。</p>
<p>每一天都是陰鬰慘淡地帶着沒有結束的怨恨——有時並沒有意識到因爲什麽而發生這樣過去了。太陽已經永遠從天空中消失掉，代以重疊的肥厚的雲塊。這些極不容易消散的雲塊無恥地盤据在人們頭頂上，時時變換着顏色，乳白，灰黑……膨脹着，盡力吞掉天空中每一個角落的比較清朗的碎片——人們底靈魂曾經把自己的希望穿過黑雲而牢牢地縛在那上面的。下一次大雨，爬了上岸——甚至預備爬上山崗的江水更高漲　。……淋得精濕了的人類在冷風中吹乾了……有些人死掉，有些人加重了疾病——構成山崗上最顯著的變動。</p>
<p>一個微雨的有點冷的夏天的下午，他們又紛紛議論着他們底行止，這當兒有一個垂死的人貢獻了他底有力的意見。</p>
<p>徐星，那害熱病的男人，玩木馬一樣地用兩手和膝蓋爬行過來。……停住了，他底染滿了涎沫扣汚泥的絡腮鬍子開始轉動，嘴裹冒出嘻嘻的噴氣。「到德頭村去！」——他底眼睛像熟透了的蘋婆果，吃力地說出這個村名來。</p>
<p>圍住他地人們受了異樣辛酸的感動，屏息着，沒有一個願意在這當兒阻擾他底話。一個主張走的男人正感到需要人來幫助他證明他底意思，渾身搖動起來了；一個女人用手使力按住自己的小小的伶俐的鼻子。</p>
<p>粗大而不加修飾地，垂死的徐星說了。</p>
<p>「……不要以爲你們就救得活我……我底老婆，這邊兩個人和那邊三個人！吿訴我你們打算拿什麽來救起那些病疼呢！又蠢又奇怪……簡直是，又蠢又奇怪！歪嘴三貓說：一條命賠一條命——他要殺人的時候就這樣說。笑話呀鄕里！你們給我們賠出來——還是我們有什麽好處呢？——走吧契弟，老婊子！這裹又沒有你們一點事：我們死掉了，我們自己會鑽進泥土裹面去的！……我底魂魄還要趕去投胎，如果你們大家都死在這裹，你們就會不讓我去。不好良心的東西。……人在有災難的時候就忘記了良心。就連鼻子也堵了起來，變成笑壞人的憨狗！你們底鼻子只會嗅出一條回老家的舊路，可是那裹已經沒有了吃的，穿的，住的，沒有了親戚朋友，祖先和神靈——什麽都沒有了！「我會做好吃的菜，可是沒有得給你的。自己滾開去找吧！」我講這句話，一共講了十三年。……難道你們底鼻子不會朝有得吃的地方嗅麽？你們懶。去吧縣知專找出來——不要倚賴誰人——你們自己對他說：你們一定要吃東西了。就是這樣，你們一定要吃東西了！……」</p>
<p>他底力量撑不住倒了下去。後來他們决定走了。……徐星是不能走的，這很明白，他曾經吿訴了別人，他預備用死去幫助决定他們底生路。</p>

<h3>牢子裏的一幕喜劇</h3>
<p>— 思慕</p>
<p>這是監獄，不，模範監獄，比起舊式的牢子或拘留所來，的確是富麗堂皇子。不要說別的，就是那瞪亭子，也夠氣勢了：玲瓏地在半天上據着，在周圍十里內，連裹頭看守人荷着長槍也可以看見；一人黑，一戔亮晃晃的電燈在那上頭懸着，閃爍着，像是妖魔的一隻眼睛，像是出在西方的一顆黃昏星——是的，那是好幾千人的運命繫着的星。圍牆照例是捶天的高，縱然已有鋼鐵似的洋灰打着。牆裹頭一樣是「鐵」在君臨着；一重又一重的閘門，柵欄，門側一桿又一桿的長槍，門內千條萬套的鎖鏈和鐐銬，構成「鐵」的王國。乙乙的沈重的門戶開閉的聲音——「鐵」的聲音；間作的一串的清脆的瑽琤的異響——「鐵」的異響。裝有鐵格子的窗戶高高的開着，但是在白盡裹點着電燈的過道還是一片陰沈。</p>
<p>牢子終古是牢子啊！</p>
<p>倉外的鐵門次第的開了，一個作頭陀打扮的和尙，有教誨師引着，一班持着念珠的男女簇擁着，邁着方步，大搖大擺地進來。可是別幻想這是地藏王的地獄巡視，甚或目蓮的破地獄，因爲這兒只是人間。</p>
<p>一行人誓到樓上一個滿掛着格言牌，講堂似的大屋子裹便停步了。才坐下半晌，雜着鐵的　擦的急響的一片葉葉的木屐聲湧進來，踉蹌魚貫前行的是二十多個男犯人——帶有一隻腳镣的沒有腳镣而像軟腳鵝似的，——隨後喧噪一湧而入的是女獄卒領着，夾有孩子嬰兒的女犯人之羣。雙方木偶似的變身合十剛做完，管牢子的老太婆瞪著眼猛喝一聲道：「嚷甚麽，好好的坐！」剛才初進門進掛在一些人的臉上的徵笑，像天冬的一閃的淡黃的日頭影那樣，登時就歛回了。</p>
<p>除了有三幾個十四五歲的童犯逼要站着之外，座位總算把全體擠得下了。跟和尙來的男女「居士」（讓我這樣子稱呼他們吧）的眼睛不約而同的向犯人射過來，仔細把他們打量着，在那裹頭縱然也穿舊西裝衣褲的青年男子，頭梳得光滑的少奶奶似的女人，但是支配他們——尤其是男犯人——的，却有一個特殊的型；首先，藏在深凹的睛眶裹的眼睛是那樣的枯呆陰沈，像是千年的腐土之於埋在地下的古銅鏡子那樣，無窮盡夜把牠們的光芒磨過乾凈了；在這樣一雙的眸子中，憂愁，痛苦，憤恨，絕望和空虛凝結膠滯着。深陷的兩頰，高慫的觀胄，拏長的嘴唇，沒有表情而有强烈的表情的力量。面色死白，腫黃，也有緋紅的，紅得像肺癆病者潮熱時一般。一句話，漫畫集裹頭的窮人頭的輪廓，相命館門前的掛圖中的苦命相和賤相，在這裹找到牠們的近似形。</p>
<p>「衆位佛友」，低沈的聲音開始從法師的口中含吐出來，「今天給衆位講的是「三世六道和十業」……」</p>
<p>法師的蓋得長長的頭髪和鬍子，襯上一件寬長的黑色棉襖，倒像是俄國革命前夜的大僧正刺斯普丁。</p>
<p>「甚麽是六道呢？上三界天道人道和阿修羅，下三界，地獄，餓鬼畜生。……十八層地獄的苦處講之不盡，五十年爲一晝夜，眞是漫漫的長夜哩！」法師接着帶笑的把餓鬼描畫出來，甚麽燈心似的脖子呵，　一般大的肚子呵，吞着火當作食糧呵，土話中雜着文言，背書似的念着。講到「身業」中的「不殺」，「不盜」，「不淫」的時候，「國家」「法律」「社會秩序」「風化」一類的字賬跟着「地獄」「地應」一塊跌出來。</p>
<p>下午的和暖的陽光從西南窗射進來，瞳瞧的一片曬在地板上，晒在囚犯的肯上，臉上。吹進來的南風膩熱中帶着沈重的濕氣，列在東窗外的數疊遠山和一業雜樹閃耀着黃金色。外頭一切都似綻裂着生機，一對小鳥兒撲喇的一聲從南窗飛進來，不避人的吱吱喳喳在打着架。春已經到了人間，而且過早地挾着初夏的熱氣來了，坐在一旁的幾個數着佛珠的女居士臉孔烘得怪紅，更有一個時裝捲髪的少女頻頻在打着呵欠，連法師的給長鬚髮映得晦暗的臉龐也眉花眼笑，滿着春意，他幷且越講越犯起勁了，笑話兒也笨拙地揷入一兩個。</p>
<p>但是除了間作的嬰孩哭聲，巡視着的女獄卒的步履聲，和外頭時送來的慣熟的銷鏈鐐銬聲外，滿屋子還是蘢罩着靜默。聽衆中好些人在緊閉着眼睛，像動物園裹白天假寐的默那樣。映在金黃的陽光下，他們的臉色越顯得慘白。一個五六歲的小孩子正扳上窗格，喜孜孜的向外頭眺望着，童犯們這時已　在地下，其中一個正在聚精會神怪有味兒地剝他的手背上的癩疥。春終也溜到這裹來了！</p>
<p>「學佛不是聽明白了就算，最要緊的還是行，」法師把修行的大道理略說幾句，今天佛法的宣講就算完了，剛才頻打呵欠的女居士吁了一口氣。「這兒有些佛珠，」教誨師謝了法師，接着向囚犯們帶笑說道具，「是一位居買來送給巳經皈依的佛友的，誰皈依了就舉手。」</p>
<p>舉手的有十多個人，一串一串的黃色小佛珠分到他們的手裹，諦視着摩挲着，有好幾個人還落了空。喜悅和羨妒的微波在聽衆中蕩漾了一下。</p>
<p>跟着又是一陣的合十，一片雜亂的木屐聲，鐐銬聲，鐵門的開閉聲。</p>
<p>當和尙一行人從樓下過道走出去的時候，兩邊高牆上的鐵窗格中，有些人頭爭向下望着，眼睛恨恨的，嘴裹喃喃的像是在咒罵着人。</p>
<p>「那個殺妾分屍的女兇手今天又看不到了，」一個女居士失望似的跟她的同伴細語着。</p>
<p>外頭駘蕩的南風還是吹着，黄色的斜陽還是照着，和尙一行人的影子巳不見了，高牆以內又依舊是完全無缺的「鐵」的君權統治着。</p>
<p>牢子終古是牢子呵！</p>
<h3>普希金的奧尼徵</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>今年的二月乃是露西亞的天才詩人普希金逝世的百週年紀念日。如大家所曉得的一般，普希金乃是近代露西亞文學的始祖。藏然，事實上，在普希金之前（從十八世紀初頭到十九世紀初頭），露西亞的現代文學就已經開始萌芽。這其間，如歴史家彖小說家加倫辛（Karam　zin）以及詩人秋可夫斯基（Zhugovsky）都會通創作或翻譯把西歐的感傷主義和浪漫主義輸進到露西亞夫。但，一般地說來，那不過是西歐文學的介紹和模做時期，充其量也不過是替嚴格意味上的現代露西亞文學擺下了一塊整腳石而巳。直到普希金如　星般地出現到文壇上以後，才挾其天才之光芒和魄力，替近代露西亞文學照出了一條坦道，並奠定了一個穩定的基礎。　得有人會稱普希金爲露西亞文學界的彼得大帝，殊非過譽。</p>
<p>普希金雖然死得很早（因爲妻子的緣故，跟人决門，被殺　死，年僅三十有七）但他的著作却異常豐富。就中最著名的，計有長篇故事詩路絲蘭與陸美拉（Ruclan　and　Lndmila），長　敘專詩奧尼徵（Evghenig　Onyeghio），史劇波里斯萬朶諾夫（Boris　Golunov），和小甲必丹之女（The　Caplain＇s　Danghter）……等等，長篇敘專詩與尼徵尤被公認爲最傑出的，最能表現作者之驚人的天才的代表作品；除非你不談直普希金則已，不然，你就得談到它：正如我們談到菜斯達爲夫斯基就不能不談到罪與罰，談到托爾斯泰就不能不談到戰爭與和平一般地。</p>
<p>現在，就讓我們來談談奧尼徵吧。</p>
<p>從一八二三年起，我們的詩人就着手寫這部東西，但其間忽斷忽續，直到一八三一年，他才把它寫完；算起來，前後差不多經過了十年之久。</p>
<p>一八二三年，詩人曾經從奧特沙寫過一封信給聖彼得堡的朋友，其中有如下的幾句話：「我此刻所寫着的，並不是小說，而是韻文的小說——道其間，有着十分厲害的差異！」……我此刻所寫着的，乃是胡亂地饒舌的敘事詩……」</p>
<p>所謂韻文小說」，所謂「敘事詩」就是指奧尼徵。</p>
<p>普希金這部作品，不但在詩人的許多傑作當中算是一篇壓卷之作，就在露西亞文學史上也占着最重要的位置；自從有了這篇東西，露西亞才有其真正的現代文學。這也就難怪郭歌里要說，普希金這一作品之出現，對於露西亞，實在是一　「非常事件」了。</p>
<p>構成這篇敘事詩（韻文小說）的情節，極簡約地說來，是這樣的。——奧尼徵（書中的主人公）是置身於社交界的一個闊少，一個貴族子弟。受過些淺薄的教育，還會說幾句爲當時露西亞社交界所必朁的法國話。一天到晚，一晚到亮，他都只是沈迷於豪奢的享樂生活當中。有一個夏天，他住在別墅裹，和鄰居的一位青年詩人名　侖斯基　成了親密的朋友·復由於侖斯基的介紹，認識了一們鄰村的女地主·這女地主有兩個女兒，大的一個名叫泰台娜（Taliona），小的一個名叫奧爾格（Olgg）·小的沒有什麽思想，大的却是個有頭腦的女子·侖斯基愛奧爾格，雙方的戀情巳經達到了快要結婚的程度。泰台娜則對奧尼徵大有一見傾心之槪；但他不太理會她，獨鍾情於奧爾格。因此，且與侖斯基决門；把他殺死了，被迫離開那個地方。泰台娜對於與尼徵雖然始終還是愛戀著；但，後來，終以母命，跟一個位高貴而多金的人結了婚，變成了大都會中的社交明星。始祖有　次，興尼徵又遇見了好。他忽然一改往日的冷淡態度，寫了許多信去向她求愛；但她置之不理。一天晚上，他潛入她的家裹，却碰到她在含著眼淚讀着他的信。於是，他極力向他求愛；但終於被她拒絕了。她拒絕他的話，來得極其繼綿衰婉，是全　最美麗的一段詩。據克魯泡特金說，一時代的露西亞婦人，在讀到那段詩時，都不免爲之嘆息流淚。</p>
<p>文豪朶斯退　夫斯基，在莫斯科的普希金鋼像揭幕時，曾發表過一篇很有名的濱說，其中曾涉及這一部畫，說過這樣的話：</p>
<p>「普希金創造了奧尼徵和泰台娜兩個典型。那是把露西亞人的心理之最是limate的秘密綜合起來的東西，依據普希金的　驚嘆的最高的技巧，這兩個人物，表現着露西亞的過云和現在，同時，還暗示着包藏了無比的美麗的特性的未來。」</p>
<p>正如朶氏所說，奧尼徵和泰台娜乃是普希金所創造的兩個典型。奧尼徵，無論從他的思想，行動，生活的任何方面說來，都可以說是十九世紀初期的露西亞智識階級的代表和化身。所以，在這種意味上，普希金所創造的這一典型——奧尼徵，正可以跟雷門托夫的白曹林（現代英雄），屠格湼夫的羅亭，朶斯退益夫斯基的拉斯科利尼可夫（罪與罰）等等相並立，而構成活生生的露西亞智識階級史上重要的連鎖。這就是說，普希金的奧尼徵實在是後日連續出現在露西亞文學當中的智識階級的典型之「始祖」。至於泰台娜呢，那更加明顯地是個露西亞女性的典型。她是個從露西亞的黑土和森林之中涎生出來的自然之子；是個將露西亞的民間故事和民謠當中所表現出來的露西亞國民精神原原本本地體現於一身的，雖單純素直但同時却具有謎一般的深湛的女性。在黑暗蕪雜的國民生活當中，找尋出潛在的優美的精神，創造出這種不減的美之典型，而能腳踏實地，絕不陷於浪漫諦克的理想化，這實在是一種値得驚嘆的天才的魄方！同時也就是這一作品之不可及的地方！</p>
<p>普希金對於我們，也如托爾斯泰和屠格湼夫等等之對於我們一樣，並不能算是生疏一個。他的作品，早就有一部分已經被輸進到中國來了。但，可惜的是，作爲這不世出的天才之最完美的結晶的這部作品，却到現在都還沒有被翻譯過來，還實在是一件憾事！因此，很希望在這最近的將來就有人出來做移權的工作，使大家都能夠有機會來欣賞，這朶奇花異卉。</p>

<h3>糧食　粉市續形虛弱</h3>
<p>係連日暴漲後之必然趨勢</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、續呈疲滯不振之象、以洋麥報價、又回跌一二角不等、且以國際事變、已稍和緩、廠家對於現洋麥、又續有問訊、　市價一高、即難免洋麥之套買、故業外之買氣、亦覺知難而退、不若幾日前之暢旺、半日成交、祇三十萬元左右、遠期市面、亦回落一分左右、迨至下午開盤、因買氣不振、廠方仍有繼續出檔、致有一部分多頭回出、市氣遂續呈虛軟、觀目下情形、因幾日之漲勢、不合情理、故陸續回鬆、亦爲勢所必然耳、</p>
<h3>期麥前市略有補空</h3>
<p>洋麥漸合算市傳有成交</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份曾見微好、以洋麥報價、雖見回落一二角不等、惟以前日之跌風太盛、一部分浮空、微有抵進、故遠期喊價、較前日好起二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、因粉市趨勢平常、且國外現洋麥報價、尙能合折、又傳澳麥成交兩船、價六元七角半、故人心逐步見平、較上午小去一二分、結果呈盤旋之勢、現麥市面、見交不暢、價仍平定、開滁州麥五元二角七、山東麥五元二角八分、由阜雙去九百包、福新去四百包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、雖有天旱報告、然作物實際上未受損害、故未能抵消他處之良好狀况、自十九日起、芝加哥雜糧交易所營業時間爲上午九時三十分至中午十二時、</p>
<h3>西貢定米漸有可能性</h3>
<p>客秈米價小去角許</p>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍旺、去化日淡、市乃續見疲軟、江西米貨主心思尙堅、但囤戶中則多有求脫、因西貢來電報小、西貢米價已降至六元四五角、雖未合划、然價目已經逐次鬆落、囤戶乃心虛求脫、各米市價一律小去角許、午後有甬幫客人購囤江西機晚等千餘包、市面始得轉定、全日開出贛米四千多包、湘米一百九十包、台米一百包、粵米五百包、邋遢米彔一百包、除囤戶外盡由本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>食米市况薄稻較挺</h3>
<p>其餘均平疲無神</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源、共到三十餘號、（貨共六千餘石、）內中薄稻居大半、故薄稻市雖包　青島烟台幫助辦二千餘包、而結果行情、高者尙小幾分、中次　角　、本街銷場淸寂異常、雖到貨稀少、而厚早等粳、價猶跌一角、陰變元疲勢、杜洋尖無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各幫來源三十一二號、市上去路、白粳呆滯、高紏小數分、中次小一角左右、陰變元短七八分、羊杜埠尖各小四五分、客尖銷路不動、價平疲、惟薄稻貨少、稍有津幫動辦、價形挺緊、其餘各貨均形帶疲、</p>
<h3>紅糧價高銷路轉呆</h3>
<p>杜荳沙黃荳價小四五分</p>
<p>紅糧市况、因內地燒坊本不甚貪、故在行情昂提之下、辦胃即行減少、昨市祇只牛荘開凍交红壳梁訂成四車、價爲三元九角、比較前市轉挫五分、現貨交易雖未做開、但其行情不免帶落、車黃豆賣買背道而馳、所以市成呆　之局、大勢因大連市盤旋、本市廠家意在抑制、故其趨勢或有回小之望、杜豆沙黃、高檔平穩、中資助轉修四五分、咋做開一千二百包、由本街溫台等辦去、</p>

<h3>五金　點錫市勢異常挺秀</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>決不會引起世界大戰</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>近年來愁雲慘霧，殺氣籠罩於全球，說者謂戰神降臨於日本德意諸國，故其侵略野心，勢如烈火，一若第二决世界大戰，卽在目前，眞是大差而特差，其實兵凶戰危，無論其戰而敗，犧牲固無可限量，卽戰而勝，其犧牲之價値，亦且不貲，彼數國者寗不知此，而甘冒天下之大不韙，貿然出此危險舉動，似屬不智，但彼等固早料其不會發生嚴重的戰爭也，不信請舉列强的內情，而一爲解剖，自可曉然。</p>
<p>（一）日本侵略我國，得寸進尺，無微不至者，彼明知我國素來最主張和平的國家，抱定寗人負我我不負人的宗旨，故無論任何嚴重壓迫侵佔，而决不願與人開釁，此一端也，而環顧列强形勢，歐洲則德意兩國，雄心勃勃，殊不可測，故英法諸國，絕對不敢干涉遠東時局，美雖不滿於日本之行爲，但形格勢禁，不得英國之助力，亦决不敢輕於仗義，而俄則新五年計劃未成，且恐德國竊窺其後，而亦不敢輕於破裂，日本覷準此點，故雖任意侵略，肆無忌憚，而决不致引起世界大戰。</p>
<p>（二）意國之所以敢用兵於阿此西尼亞者，明知阿係未開化之國家，其國內之飛機，共有十二架，駕駛員祇有八人，故意國之用兵阿國，如入無人之境，勝算可操，此一事也，並且默察歐洲的情形，法正恃意爲重，以控制德國，决不敢與意啟　，而英不得法之助力，亦必不能用武力以制裁意國，可以斷言，並且一面放出德意聯盟空氣，使英法諸國，更不敢出而與意國爲難，意國看凖此點，故敢越地中海而侵略阿國，亦决不致引起世界大戰。</p>
<p>（三）德兵此决開進萊茵地區，題目是借法俄締結盟的，認爲違反羅卡諾公的，共實德國覷定歐洲各國同床各夢的弱點，意阿戰爭，法不肯出力與英合作，則德兵開進萊茵，英未必能與法國一致，此其一，並且遠東局勢，日見緊張，萬一各國對德果有積極行爲，則德日有聯結之可能，比其二，更進一步說，日之對華，意之對阿，完全是侵略行爲，尙且無法制止，而德國僅為自衛舉動，更屬振振有辭，此其三，德國看凖此點，故敢耀武揚威，進兵萊茵，毫無忌憚，更不致引起世界大戰。</p>
<p>以上三國、雖似窮兵　武，好大喜功，但早已算定，决不會發生嚴重影響，而得到不幸結果，已極明瞭，故古人語曰，惟殺乃能止殺，希特勒曰，惟戰爭中方能得到和平，若從和平中求和平，其結果反而引起大戰，眞是言之有理</p>
<h3>借書</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>—課餘散記</p>
<p>到這小縣城來做敎書匠已兩個月了，第一個星期日到過一决公共體育塲，里面附設着一個小規模的圖書館，我就在里面坐上半天，幾乎翻遍了里面各種書籍。管理員是一個戴着極度近視眼鏡的中年人，他見我是生客，所以特別注視我的行動。當我翻到書櫥里的書的時候，他竟是從用木柵攔着的一角辦公室里走出來，彷彿審問我似的問我倒底要看什麽書？到這小縣城來後，我就不想來說話，同事們對我也都很隔膜，我覺得這甩的人們都具有一種特別的典型，而那圖書館里的管理員就是個代表者。我祇有對他微笑，當他第二遍問我時，我才回答他我想看一點我所耍看的書。是吾他見我態度强硬，或者他沒有懂得我的俏皮的回答，就悻悻然地退回一角辦公室了，雖然他還是留意着我的行動。最後我翻到一冊在上海時朋友託我購買的書籍，當時我跑遍了四馬路的每家書店，及城里城外幾個比較有名的舊書攤，但是都沒有。寫信回報了朋友，他要我隨時留意着，卽使是借來抄一抄也是好的。現在竟是在無意中找到了這冊踏破鐵鞋無處尋的書籍，我就想借來快郵給我的朋友，因爲我知道這里學校里的帥長是可以向圖書館借出的。於是我不得不向那位管理員交涉了：我先告訴他我是這里中學校的英文敎員某，那冊書想借出去。他似乎是吃驚，又是懷疑，其實用心理學分晰起來，那位典型代表的管理員是應該同時被吃驚和懷疑交戰着的。我知道他處處注意着我的行動是提防我是偸書賊，但是穿藍布棉袍的我竟是這里中學校的英文敎員，他的呆鈍的眼珠子在極度坡璃片里轉動了，似乎想在什麽地方搜尋一點我是英文敎員的特徵來。我們隔着木柵半嚮呆立着。這該是那位管理員的靈機吧，他用着生硬的英語問我在中學里做了幾年英文敎員了，——這小縣城里僅有這樣一所由</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>地方經費所開辦的中學校，學生是少得可憐的，因爲足供溫飽的入家就不想讀什麽書，想讀書的學齡子弟却都是帮着他們的父兄做賣買。所以每學期從小學畢業的名單上升入中學的常常不及什之一。那位管理員能說幾句生硬的英語可算該縣的超等人材了。但是我當時笑了起來，愚笨的人往往想自作聰明而其實做出最愚笨的事的。我也用英文回答他我决不是偸書賊，那册書用來包花生米是顯得太浪費一點的。我沒有管他聽懂了我的話沒有，伸手在一、塊水板上題上我的名字及所借的書。</p>
<p>第二天在敎員室我的朋友校長笑着吿訴我：「昨天晚上圖書館里的管理員到我家里來問起你的名字，他說很不放心你借去一冊書。我告訴他你是我的老朋友，由我的面子才到這里來敎書的，那冊書由我負責罷。他才道歉似的說今天要來拜訪你。」</p>
<p>聽了校長的話，我欲笑都無從了，我希望我的所授課的學生們都要更愚笨一點，吾則我的罪孽太深重了。</p>
<p>下午那管理員果然來拜訪我，我吩咐茶役回他不在校，以後我不敢再上圖書館去。</p>
<h3>瞎子先生</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>故鄉紀事之一</p>
<p>穿着件潔凈的藍土布長衫的瞎子先生，在差不多一定的時問出現於長街上了。他邊搖着左手裏的小銅鈴，邊使用右手的棒子指探路，緩緩往前走。俏皮的孩子游蕩在街中沒玩兒，看見瞎子先生，便一窩兒緊跟着，大聲呌嚷：</p>
<p>『瞎子先生，當心啊，前面是一條溝』。</p>
<p>『瞎子先生，你要碰到牆上去了，快走轉來吧』。</p>
<p>孩子們裝鬼臉，想盡心思哄騙他，都抱着一種看瞎子跌一交，或者掉進水溝裏的好奇心理。有的瞧瞧瞎子並不相信自己的謊話，竟會硬拉起瞎子的棒子，牽引到眞有水溝的和牆壁的地方，存心呌他碰撞一下才滿足。</p>
<p>瞎子是不免冒火了，站穩着，不向前亦不向後，忿忿地說道：『你們這些小鬼，全沒天良，老想合我開玩笑』。但剛說過，他卽刻又擺出一面溫靄的乞求似的臉孔：（未完）</p>

<h3>Arita and Zhang Qun's Talks Conclude: China and Japan Jointly Issue Announcement, Exchanging Diplomatic Views Without Insisting on Any Conclusions; Although Views Did Not Fully Align, Mutual Intentions Were Understood</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Japanese Ambassador Arita visited Foreign Minister Zhang again on the afternoon of the 19th at 2:30 PM for a fourth round of talks on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Minister Zhang and Ambassador Arita each summarized the opinions they had expressed in recent days. The total talking time for the four days was eleven hours. Although the views of both sides could not be completely aligned, both sides believed that it would be beneficial to the communication of each other's intentions. At 8 PM that evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country and the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing simultaneously issued an announcement. Foreign Minister Zhang also expressed his feelings to reporters about his talks with Arita in recent days. Arita is scheduled to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 20th to bid farewell, with the Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs acting as interpreter. That evening, he will travel to Shanghai with his entourage to convene a meeting of consuls from various places. After the meeting, he will travel north to Tianjin and then return to his country via that route. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Japanese Ambassador Arita visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, for a fourth round of informal exchange of views. He left at 4:30 PM. The talks between the two parties came to an end at this point, and a joint announcement was issued. According to Foreign Minister Zhang, when talking to visiting reporters, the general outline of his talks with Ambassador Arita in recent days has been seen in the announcement issued today. Looking back on these four talks, although no concrete conclusions were reached, this opportunity for both sides to freely listen to each other's views will be of some benefit to future negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. During the talks in recent days, Ambassador Arita maintained a sincere, straightforward, and pleasant attitude throughout, which I greatly admire. Ambassador Arita is one of Japan's most outstanding diplomats. Although he has only been in China for half a month, with his keen eye and what he has heard and seen since coming to China, he must have a deep and accurate understanding of the crux of the Sino-Japanese problem.

<h3>A Turning Point in the Relaxation of the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Hitler unilaterally abandoned the Locarno Treaty, and German troops re-entered the Rhineland demilitarized zone, suddenly threatening the European peace situation. Both France and Belgium jointly requested the League of Nations to stop Germany's actions. Other signatory countries to the Locarno Treaty were also willing to provide assistance, resulting in the Paris Conference. However, the two parties to the meeting still achieved nothing. Therefore, the United Kingdom invited the signatory countries and the Council of the League of Nations to London to continue discussing this issue. The London Conference has now opened. Germany accepted the invitation of the League of Nations and sent Ribbentrop to attend, and the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty have also reached a compromise, advocating mutual demilitarization. Will the serious situation caused by Germany's abandonment of the treaty be temporarily eased as a result?</p>
<p>Whether the European situation can be eased depends first on the intentions of the United Kingdom. The Rhineland area was originally German territory. During World War I, the French Prime Minister Clemenceau wanted to carve up the area and create the Rhineland Republic as a buffer between Germany and France. Later, due to Wilson's doctrine, it was renamed the demilitarized zone in the Peace Treaty to prevent the Westward advance of the German state. In 1925, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Belgium signed the Locarno Treaty to re-guarantee the effectiveness of this treaty, and Germany once again recognized the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland area. Since then, France believed that the Rhine border would no longer be threatened by Germany, and did not pay attention to the fortifications and mobilization plans in that area. Now Germany has unilaterally abandoned the treaty and sent troops into the Rhineland, and France's national defense has been greatly threatened. It is natural that it is panic-stricken and insists on stopping it. The British Conservative Party has always hated the Soviet Union. Since it seized power, it has been suppressing France and helping Germany, and has always facilitated those who promoted "anti-Soviet" views. Hitler also called himself a pioneer of "anti-Soviet". It is also inevitable that he can win the favor of the British Conservative Party. Last year, the Anglo-German naval agreement was concluded, and Germany's naval power increased. The Nazis have a great desire to try their hand in the Baltic Sea. This time, Germany abandoned the treaty, and the United Kingdom has always advocated negotiations between the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty and Germany to avoid sanctions and ease the situation. Its pro-German heart is becoming more and more obvious. Italy took the opportunity to coerce and advocated opposition to sanctions. Under such international circumstances, France will naturally find it difficult to insist on its proposal for sanctions. The reason why the European situation can be expected to ease temporarily is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The attitude of various small countries in Europe is also of great importance to the European situation. Belgium in Western Europe borders Germany, and its influence from Germany's invasion of the Rhineland is consistent with that of France. Its attitude is naturally pro-French. Although Switzerland and the Netherlands have always maintained neutrality, they are concerned that Germany's military plans may lead to an invasion of France. They should not take Germany's abandonment of the treaty lightly. The Benelux countries were originally allies of France, and there is no doubt that they are pro-French and anti-German. The Balkan Pact countries, in addition to Romania and Yugoslavia in the Little Entente, also include Greece and Turkey. Greece has always followed the lead of the United Kingdom, and Turkey has close relations with the Soviet Union and has no good feelings towards Germany, given Germany's eastward expansion policy. Austria in Central Europe has always opposed Germany. Only Hungary and Bulgaria in the Balkans are still pro-German. As for Poland, although it has a ten-year non-aggression treaty with Germany, the relationship between the two countries has not yet been fully developed, and the Polish government has most earnestly expressed to the French ambassador that it will do its best to fulfill its obligations under the Franco-Polish alliance, which may be mistakenly regarded as a harbinger of the Polish government's defection. Judging from this, various small countries in Europe, under Hitler's unilateral abandonment of the treaty, clearly have a tendency to unite against Germany. This time, Germany was able to accept the invitation of the League of Nations to attend the Council meeting, which may have been due to the influence of the surrounding countries. The reason why the European situation can be expected to ease temporarily is another reason.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, the serious European situation caused by Germany's abandonment of the treaty may be temporarily eased due to the trend of international relations. However, we cannot help but worry about this. In the past, Japan violated the Washington Treaty and sent troops into the Northeast Provinces, only receiving international moral condemnation. Italy violated Articles 10, 11, and 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and sent troops to East Africa, only receiving incomplete sanctions. Now, Germany has abandoned the Locarno Treaty and not only has not been sanctioned, but has also had the opportunity to compromise. Is there any seriousness left in the international covenants of today?</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Passes Motion Condemning Germany's Violation of Treaties, German Representative Speaks Eloquently, Locarno Powers Reach Agreement, Germany Finds It Difficult to Negotiate</h3>
<p>London: After the German representative presented his case, the League of Nations Administrative Council unanimously passed a motion by France and Belgium this afternoon condemning Germany's violation of the Locarno Treaty and the Treaty of Versailles, with Germany being the sole dissenting vote, but its vote was not effective. Ecuador was absent. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries recently held a meeting at 2:00 PM today to finalize a compromise regarding the proposals they intend to submit to the League of Nations Administrative Council concerning the handling of Germany's violation of treaties. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: It was announced today that the Locarno Treaty signatory countries, namely Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy, have reached a compromise on the issues arising from Germany's unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and its dispatch of troops to reoccupy the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Submit the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to determine whether it conflicts with the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>(2) The police duties in the demilitarized zone on the German border will be carried out by an international police force. (The British suggested that the demilitarized zone should be closed to France and Belgium, but France opposed this proposal because, if implemented, France would have to dismantle its fortified border defenses.)</p>
<p>(3) The general staffs of Britain and France will jointly develop a plan to defend the border.</p>
<p>According to the communiqué, the Locarno Treaty countries met at the British Foreign Office last night at 10:00 PM and adjourned at 2:00 AM today, drafting the above agreement. However, certain reservations still need to be made and further discussions are required. These reservations mostly concern the plans that the British and French military authorities should implement on the Franco-German border. The Locarno Treaty countries will meet again today to discuss the details of this agreement, but it must first be approved by the British and French governments before it can be implemented. The news of the agreement has greatly eased the tense atmosphere. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The German side believes that the negotiation basis contained in this agreement may not be approved by Hitler, especially the second point stipulating that an international police force occupy a 20-kilometer zone on the German border. German officials have already issued criticisms that this point is completely unacceptable. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Representative Announces Reasons for Abrogation to League of Nations, Sovereignty of Independent Countries Cannot Be Restricted, Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty Endangers Germany</h3>
<p>London: At 10:30 AM this morning, the League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting after a closed-door meeting. German representative General Ribbentrop delivered a lengthy speech, stating the reasons why Germany unilaterally abrogated the Locarno Treaty and sent troops to reoccupy the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. After Ribbentrop's speech, the meeting was extended to 3:00 PM to allow representatives of other countries to have the opportunity to speak. At the beginning of the meeting, the German representative stood up and spoke, hoping that the restoration of relations between Germany and the League of Nations could be a major turning point in the history of Europe, which has been mired in multiple disturbances for many years after the European War.</p>
<p>He continued that Germany's fundamental attitude towards the Locarno Treaty was explained by Hitler on March 7th. The main feature of the treaty is to prevent France and Belgium on the one hand and Germany on the other from resorting to force. The signatory countries have assumed the responsibility of adding to Germany, making the important and densely populated Rhineland area without any military protection. From a fair standpoint, imposing such restrictions on the sovereignty of a country will ultimately be an unacceptable condition for that country.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop then cited the following reasons why Germany opposed the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty:</p>
<p>The treaty combines two countries with a total of 275 million people.</p>
<p>Both contracting parties have the strongest military power in the world.</p>
<p>The treaty is specifically designed to defend against Germany.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is very far away from Germany, and Germany cannot attack it. Since it has concluded a military alliance with Czechoslovakia, its border is indirectly connected to the periphery of Germany.</p>
<p>After France and Russia conclude this treaty, they can become judges of their own cases, because they can arbitrarily designate any country as an aggressor without going through the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop then stated the fifth point and the reasons why Germany considers this treaty illegal, saying that the first clause of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty allows France to decide whether Germany or Soviet Russia is an aggressor and includes a reservation that France can make military arrangements according to its own decisions without being subject to the sanctions plans implemented by the guarantor countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain and Italy. This reservation is legally and factually ineffective because it is impossible for France to predict the attitude of the guarantor countries. Germany's fear of this treaty is that a country gets a small consolation in its rights when it is attacked by a military alliance with overwhelming power, which the League of Nations has designated as an aggressor. What sanctions can strike such a huge alliance, stretching from East Asia to the English Channel? Such a large alliance, which is also a member of the League of Nations with adjudicative power and a powerful military force, is practically impossible to impose sanctions on.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop then asked the Administrative Council whether it is reasonable for the German government, having signed the Locarno Treaty, to still have to fulfill the obligations of the treaty if it discovers a situation that only Germany shoulders, as has been discovered later? Since Germany and France have given up their military force in their relationship because of the Locarno Treaty, but if the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, which is a new obligation of military assistance formed on one side to prevent the other, is interpreted, it is absolutely impossible in the German government's firm belief and fair interpretation. If this view existed when the Locarno Treaty was concluded, then the contracting parties should have paid attention to this. If so, then the Locarno Treaty would never have been concluded. France claims that the Franco-Soviet agreement was necessary to counter Germany's rearmament. This is clearly wrong because the Locarno Treaty stipulates the restoration of military equality between France and Germany, because its concluding protocol has confirmed France's obligation to follow Germany's military arrangements with other countries. Because France refused to restore equality in this way, Germany was forced to achieve equality by its own means and achieve the purpose of the Locarno Treaty. Germany has not concluded any military alliances. Germany has repeatedly made peace contributions to France, but they have all been rejected or ignored by France. After France ratified the Franco-Soviet treaty, Hitler took the only possible action to restore Germany's full sovereignty over its entire territory. The German government believes that the accusation that Germany unilaterally violated the Locarno Treaty is incorrect and unfair and rejects it because the Locarno Treaty has been invalidated by France's actions.</p>
<h3>Germany Unwilling to Resort to World Court, Whether Franco-Soviet Treaty and Locarno Conflict Still Needs to be Determined</h3>
<p>Regarding France's proposal to submit the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty to the International Court of Justice for arbitration, he has one word to answer, that is, this issue has significant political implications in addition to purely legal aspects, and its practical solution cannot be sought in a court of law. If the German government were to clarify this matter through negotiations with the signatory countries, it would not be able to succeed. He made this statement with regret. Past experiences have proven that such actions have never achieved practical results. As for the future, Germany's sovereignty has already extended to its entire territory, and equality has been achieved.</p>
<h3>Germany Prepared to Abandon Past Grievances and Reconcile with France to Rebuild European Peace</h3>
<p>Germany is now willing and ready to end the regrettable page of history that is erroneous in the spirit of the law. After the Locarno Treaty is eliminated, the German people will be relieved of their spiritual and political burden. The German people are now willing to live in peace and friendship with their neighbors and engage in the reconstruction of a truly united Europe to the best of their ability. Germany is determined to conclude treaties with foreign countries as a fully sovereign country in the future, freely and without restraint, in order to end the tension between France and Germany. The German leader has made an unprecedented contribution to European peace in this spirit. The content and implementation of Germany's proposals do not require criticism. They contain a lot, and all politicians who care about the happiness of Europe are willing to see them realized in one way or another.</p>
<p>During Ribbentrop's speech, the scene in the hall was very solemn. Ribbentrop was dressed in pure black and was one of the first representatives to arrive at St. James's Palace, where he was greeted by Chairman Bruce. When the meeting was announced, the German representatives took their seats. Ribbentrop suddenly saw French Foreign Minister Flandin and walked to the round table. Flandin then stood up and shook hands. Then Italian representative, the ambassador to London, Grandi shook hands with the German representatives. Ribbentrop spoke quickly. Flandin leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. Grandi sat with his arms crossed and looked calm and composed. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Meeting</h3>
<p>London: The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting this morning to listen to the speech of the German Chief Representative Ribbentrop. This is the first time that its representative has spoken at the League of Nations since it announced its withdrawal on October 16, 1933. Ribbentrop entered Queen Anne's Hall at 10:35 AM, with a dignified demeanor and the air of a British gentleman. The two experts following him attracted unusual attention when they entered the venue. Ribbentrop first shook hands with French Foreign Minister Flandin, regardless of Minister Peng Gu, and then took a seat on the far right end of the horseshoe-shaped conference table. Chairman Bruce, the Australian representative, then announced the meeting at 10:40 AM and immediately requested all representatives to take a film together, so that this historically valuable event could be left as a memorial for future generations. After the photography was completed, Ribbentrop stood up and delivered his speech, which was at 10:45 AM. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Afternoon Meeting</h3>
<p>London: When the Administrative Council continued its meeting in the afternoon, Chairman Bruce of Australia announced that his responsibility was to announce his support for the submission of the French and Belgian proposal to condemn Germany's violation of the treaty. Although he had heard the remarks of German representative Ribbentrop, he had not changed his view of his own responsibilities. The current issue is fundamentally related to the entire system of the League of Nations. He felt that French Foreign Minister Flandin and Belgian Minister Janson had shown considerable moderation in this difficult environment. It is now the responsibility of the League of Nations Administrative Council to decide how to proceed. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: It is rumored that the League of Nations Council will be extended to Saturday and Sunday (the 21st). At that time, it will urge Germany to submit the issue of whether the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and the Locarno Treaty conflict to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Locarno Powers Reach Agreement, French Deputy Chief of Staff Arrives in England</h3>
<p>London: The Locarno Treaty countries' meeting recently issued a communiqué to the press, stating that "the representatives of the countries concerned have reached an agreement in principle." This agreement only needs to be interpreted by observers and must go through two procedures before it can be completed:</p>
<p>Approved by the French government. Regarding this, Foreign Minister Flandin is scheduled to fly back to Paris by special plane at 2:00 PM today to seek instructions.</p>
<p>Approved by the British Cabinet. As for the content of the agreement, the main points are no more than three measures: (A) The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty should be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication, but Germany must accept the judgment. (B) The Rhineland region should be temporarily garrisoned by troops dispatched by the Locarno Treaty guarantor countries, namely Britain and Italy. (C) The safety of France and Belgium should have practical guarantees, including the Sky Pact. In addition, if the Rhineland region needs to be re-fortified by the responsible country, the British General Staff should conclude an agreement with the French and Belgian General Staffs so that Britain will immediately come to the aid of France and Belgium if they are invaded. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries are currently discussing the issue of security in the Rhineland region. French Deputy Chief of Staff General Schwerenski arrived here last night to exchange views with the representatives of various countries on military issues. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Locarno Treaty signatory countries held a meeting in the "Ambassador's Room" of the Foreign Office at 12:30 noon and adjourned at 3:35 PM. The representatives attending the meeting had a simple meal at the Foreign Office. As a result of the meeting, no compromise was reached. It is now scheduled to continue the meeting at 10:00 PM. French Minister Peng Gu told our reporter after the meeting that "the time for compromise is not yet near." Foreign Minister Flandin also said that "the opinions of the countries concerned on the main points are still far apart." According to our diplomatic reporter, French Foreign Minister Flandin agreed to the compromise plan proposed by Belgian Prime Minister Janson, but British Foreign Secretary Eden only approved part of it. At this moment, the main difficulty is still the issue of Britain's military assistance to France and Belgium. Foreign Minister Flandin and Prime Minister Janson went to the Belgian Embassy together after the meeting to continue consultations. In addition, French Minister Peng Gu and Belgian Ambassador to England Mashian represented their respective countries at the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The representatives of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries, after a meeting at noon yesterday, resumed the meeting at 10:00 PM that night and adjourned at 2:00 AM this morning. A representative of a certain country announced to the press after the meeting that "the representatives of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium" have reached an agreement in principle. Most of the objections previously raised by the French delegation have been satisfied. Regarding the issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty conflicts with the Locarno Treaty, it was decided to compel Germany to submit it to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication and accept the judgment. Regarding the demilitarized zone, a 20-kilometer zone bordering France and Belgium on the German border should be designated and garrisoned by international troops. There is no need to establish a demilitarized zone within France and Belgium. The technical implementation of this will be implemented once it is decided. The above-mentioned measures have been drafted as proposals and are only awaiting the League of Nations Administrative Council to organize them at its morning meeting today. After attending the meeting of the Administrative Council, French Foreign Minister Flandin will return to Paris to submit the full text of the proposal for discussion at the afternoon meeting of the State Council. At the same time, the British Cabinet is also scheduled to meet this afternoon to approve the plan proposed by British Foreign Secretary Eden. The results will be immediately notified to French Foreign Minister Flandin so that he can present a report to the State Council after returning home. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French President Approves, Franco-Soviet Agreement Takes Effect, Reserves Called Up Early</h3>

As for the additional funding needed for the construction or improvement of the barracks near the border fortresses, the government will soon submit it to the Chamber of Deputies for approval. In addition, the reserves who should be conscripted for training this summer according to customary practice will be conscripted in the next few weeks to strengthen border defenses and complete the national defense system during this tense diplomatic situation. However, soldiers who have recently been discharged will not be reconscripted. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Held the Previous Day: Italy Expresses Commitment to Locarno Obligations</h3>
<p>London - The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting at 3:45 PM, first deciding on the agenda for the day's meeting. Afterwards, a public meeting was held at 4 PM, chaired by Australian representative Bruce. Representatives from England, Italy, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Romania, and Portugal successively delivered speeches, adjourning at 6 PM. It was decided that the meeting would continue at 10 AM the following morning. German representative Ribbentrop did not arrive in London until 5:10 PM, missing the meeting. Therefore, Mr. Hilden, the secretary of the German embassy, attended as an observer. The details of the speeches given by the representatives of various countries are recorded below:</p>
<p>British representative Eden spoke first, stating, "The clauses of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland have been violated. The facts are clear and undeniable. The responsibility borne by the speaker at this time is extremely arduous, and the potential consequences are very serious. Therefore, we must be prudent in dealing with this matter. However, the current situation contains two elements that we can utilize to ease public concerns and build peace. What are these elements? Namely, (1) although the act of violation is very obvious, it does not immediately threaten war, and the clauses of the Locarno Treaty that should be invoked under certain circumstances do not need to be invoked immediately. Therefore, we can act calmly with a cautious and decisive attitude; (2) even if any situation is serious, there must be opportunities that can be utilized." Eden then said that the League of Nations Administrative Council should use all the clauses of the Covenant as a compass to consider the current situation from various perspectives, because the Administrative Council has this right and it is also its responsibility. "We must try to maintain peace, and we must go further to ensure that the terrible illusion of war never appears before our eyes again. To achieve this goal, various methods should be studied, because international confidence has been greatly shaken today, and all countries should work together to restore confidence and build a secure system. This is especially incumbent upon our countries, which are all major powers in Western Europe," he said.</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador to England Grandi then spoke, saying that the problem caused by Germany's rearmament of the Rhineland should be resolved rationally and not emotionally. "However, the violation comes from a large country, and its cooperation is indispensable for laying the foundation for peace and promoting culture. This is something we are particularly saddened by. Italy fully understands its responsibilities and is willing to abide by all obligations." Grandi then mentioned Italy's sanctions, saying that Italy is both a country being sanctioned and a guarantor of the Locarno Treaty, which is a contradiction that the Administrative Council should pay attention to. "The Italian conflict is only a colonial incident, and its significance should not have been expanded too much. How could European peace be tied to this case? The decisions made by the League of Nations regarding Italy have weakened the political foundation of the Locarno Treaty, which is one of the main reasons for the current situation." Grandi then asked all countries to prove their goodwill so that "there is still a glimmer of hope for building peace." Finally, Grandi explained that Italy has made many contributions to ensuring European stability in the past, and said, "It seems that the general public does not pay attention to the past. Future construction must be based on the following two points: (1) the needs of national life, and countries should understand and respect each other; (2) the concepts of all countries regarding the rights, interests, and obligations of modern culture should be unified," he said.</p>
<p>Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck argued that the Administrative Council should register Germany's violation of the treaty by rearming the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, and that the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty should review it. He said that Poland did not welcome the signing of the Locarno Treaty, but Poland still recognized that the treaty was within the scope of the Franco-Polish alliance. In January 1934, Poland and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty based on mutual respect and a desire for peace to establish relations between the two countries. Poland's obligations under previous agreements (referring to the Franco-Polish alliance, etc.) will not be changed by the signing of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. After that, Poland and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, the purpose of which was to stabilize peace in Eastern Europe. At this time, the good-neighborly relations between Poland and Russia are still based on this treaty." Beck concluded that any event that is related to the interests of a certain country should be discussed with the participation of that country, he said.</p>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu spoke on behalf of the Little Entente countries, saying that if the League of Nations fails in the current situation, the collective security system will die. He also said that although the Locarno Treaty has been abolished by Germany, it is still valid for the four countries of England, France, Belgium, and Italy, he said. Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro spoke last, endorsing what Titulescu said. The Administrative Council then adjourned. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Flooding on the Atlantic Coast of the United States: Disaster Situation is Extremely Severe, Affected Area Spans Eleven States, 70 Dead, Tens of Thousands Homeless, Material Losses of 35 Million</h3>
<p>New York - The states along the Atlantic coast of the eastern United States have been hit by massive floods, causing a major disaster, the worst in 50 years. So far, 50 people have died in the floods, and as many as 30,000 people have been left homeless. The affected area extends from Connecticut in the north to North and South Carolina in the south. Among them, Pennsylvania has been the hardest hit. Pittsburgh, an important industrial city in the state with a population of 700,000, has been turned into a swamp. All transportation has been cut off. When the water flowed into the city, its momentum was rapid, and residents could not escape in time. As many as several thousand people were trapped in the water. All the shops moved the goods downstairs to the upstairs to avoid being submerged. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>New York - Grayson, the head of the American Red Cross, stated today that the area currently affected by the disaster covers at least eleven states, and the number of families in distress is countless. In order to achieve the minimum level of relief, the Red Cross must quickly raise a relief fund of 3 million US dollars. Grayson went on to say that the states most in need of assistance are Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and Virginia. As for North and South Carolina, they will also be affected soon. At the same time, the Massachusetts Police Headquarters issued a warning from Boston today, ordering residents in the Connecticut River basin to evacuate quickly, and all volunteer groups were ordered to go to the disaster-stricken area to assist in relief efforts. Two sluice gates near Pittsfield were destroyed. A telegram from Northampton said that the depth of the water reached 20 feet in some places. The residents of Hayfield are now gathered on high ground, like isolated islands in the sea. The dikes in the Williamstown area were also destroyed, and residents fled. There are 300 homeless people in Milton. The water in the streets of Lock Haven is 12 feet deep, and there are also fires. Some of the refugees in St. Solley are suffering from epidemics, which increases people's fear. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>New York - The flood-stricken area in the six eastern states of the United States is very wide, the disaster situation is extremely severe, and there is a shortage of food, which makes it even more difficult for the victims. The number of deaths has now reached 70. Railway and road traffic is completely blocked, and food cannot be imported into the disaster area. The food stored in the warehouses has mostly been submerged. All the food in the shops has either been looted or sold at exorbitant prices. There is no sign that the water level is falling. The authorities are now trying to prevent the downstream waters of the Mississippi River from entering the sea smoothly. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>New York - A flood followed by an explosion occurred on Wheeling Island in West Virginia. It is now known that 28 people have died. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Pittsburgh - The local power plant was unable to supply electricity due to the flood, so the entire town was dark all night. A large part of the town is currently in the water, and many streets have been turned into small rivers. National Guard soldiers are patrolling the streets by boat on land. All trains have been suspended. Automobile traffic in New Jersey and Pennsylvania has also been suspended for the time being. Many bridges have been submerged by the water. The police in Massachusetts issued a broadcast warning, urging people living near the Condorc River to evacuate quickly because the dikes have collapsed. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Harrisburg - As many as 300,000 military police, volunteers, and workers are waiting for orders here to go to the disaster area to provide relief. Three thousand people have been sent to Johnstown, Pittsburgh, Lewistown, St. Solley, and other places. The remaining 19,000 people are ready to move at any time, and another 275,000 people are also waiting for orders. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Johnstown, USA - Yesterday, the surging waters of the Conemaugh River and the Stonycreek River turned this industrial center in western Pennsylvania into a desolate scene. Today, the water has receded slightly, and there is no danger in the residential area. The number of casualties is still only two so far. However, after the water recedes in the city area, there may be new discoveries. The informal estimate of the loss in this disaster is about 35 million US dollars. The area where the large stores and large apartments in the city center are located is still several feet deep in water today. The elders said that this flood is more dangerous than the largest flood in the United States in 1889. However, 2,300 people were killed that year, but this time the residents were fortunate to have enough time to escape from the city center and take refuge in the higher residential areas. Now, 3,000 people who live in the city area are homeless. The authorities have taken measures to carry out relief work and pay attention to hygiene to prevent epidemics. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, USA - Today, the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers, at the confluence, have flooded the banks, submerging the "Golden Triangle" where the city area is located to a depth of 18 feet. City business has completely stopped due to traffic obstruction. The estimated loss is at least 10 million yuan and as high as 100 million yuan. The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange has indefinitely suspended business, and all city theaters have also stopped performing. At the same time, there were two fires in the city, which were extinguished with great difficulty. At noon today, the depth of the water in the three rivers reached 43 feet, while it is usually only 18 feet, exceeding it by 25 feet. The previous highest record was 37 feet. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>New York - Thousands of square miles in the eastern states of the United States are all in the water. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in the United States in the past 100 years. Many bridges and dams have been destroyed, traffic has been blocked, and hundreds of houses have collapsed. It is now known that 34 people have died. The disaster has affected six states, with Pennsylvania being the most severely affected. The loss is estimated at millions of yuan. While the flood is raging, fires are also breaking out. Firefighters have to block the water and put out the fire, which is very busy. The number of deaths is increasing at any time. Thousands of people are homeless. Pittsburgh, the second largest city in Pennsylvania, is a famous steel manufacturing center and has suffered great damage. The Allegheny River has risen to an unprecedented height of 44 feet. The low-lying area in the city, known as the Golden Triangle, is 4 feet deep in water. Three-quarters of the Bethlehem Steel Plant has been flooded. 700,000 people have been cut off by the water and are not in contact with the outside world. In Etna and Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, explosions occurred due to the flood. Wei in Lawrenceville has now exploded, and the sound has shaken the surrounding areas. The fire is raging, and the houses of the Pittsburgh Spring Steel Plant nearby have also been affected. The Queenining Dam in Pennsylvania is now leaking and may collapse at any time, because the water level of the Ohio River is extremely high, setting a new record. The Susquehanna River has also overflowed its banks. Residents of Plainton initially used sandbags to block the water, but seeing that it was ineffective, they abandoned their homes and fled. Those who live along the river are building obstacles around their houses to prevent the water from rushing in.</p>
<p>The water of the Potomac River in Maryland has also risen, submerging Hancock Town, about 5 feet deep. The water level is still rising at a rate of 3 feet per hour. The electric company has been unable to supply electricity, and the demand for candles has increased greatly.</p>
<p>A wireless telegram from Ithaca, New York, said that the outside of the city is all water, traffic has been cut off, and telegraphs and telephones are currently unavailable.</p>
<p>In Connecticut, more than a dozen houses in New Hartford were washed away by the water due to the collapse of the river dam. People living in the Farmington River basin have now been ordered by the authorities to evacuate.</p>
<p>Many towns in Vermont have also been cut off by the water. The water in the Connecticut River is very rapid and continues to rise. A large ice floe collided with the river dam, and there is a risk of a breach.</p>
<p>In Wheeling, Virginia, 30,000 residents have been left homeless due to the flooding of the Ohio River. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>United States Expands Navy: 18 New Ships to Be Built This Year, Navy Personnel to Increase to 100,000</h3>
<p>Washington - The Navy Department recently announced that the US Navy currently has a total of 88,000 active duty personnel. From now until the end of 1937, it will increase to 100,000.

<h3>A Brief Discussion of Soil Improvement Methods (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Naifeng, Technician, Central Agricultural Experiment Institute</p>
<p>It is more difficult to improve naturally bad soil, because natural forces are not easy to change. For example, if it is too dry or too wet, we humans do not yet have the ability to create rain or the sun to change it. However, these types of bad forces can still be remedied. As for the inherent badness of the soil itself, there is no way to transform it.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about remedies for excessive dryness, which is irrigation. This issue can be divided into two layers: irrigation methods and the changes that occur in the soil after irrigation. There are many irrigation methods. One is diversion irrigation, which is diverting rivers from high places to irrigate low-lying areas. The Jinghui Canal in our country uses this method and has already achieved great success. At the same time, there are many other canals in Shaanxi, such as the Luohui Canal and the Weihui Canal, which will soon be successful. The second type is water storage irrigation. The meaning of water storage is to build a dam in a high place or in the mountains to block the water and raise the water level. In this way, it can be irrigated from a high position. Another type is water pumping irrigation, which is pumping water from low places to high places for irrigation. As for the pumping method, some places in the United States use tin pipes. In China, we do not have these pipes and use channels. The organization of channels often includes main channels, and there are many branch channels beside the main channels. Farmers then find ways to divert the water from the branch channels to their land. There is also well digging. In the southern part of Hebei Province, there are many places that use well water for irrigation. They spend 30-40 yuan to dig a well, and the capital can be recovered within two or three years. There are two types of wells: soil wells and foreign wells. The difference is that soil wells are shallower, and foreign wells are deeper. Soil wells use local water, and foreign wells mostly use water from distant places. In terms of cost, soil wells are cheaper, and foreign wells are more expensive. In addition, in very dry places, drought-resistant plants can sometimes be used, but this is also limited. If the rainfall is less than 300 millimeters, it will not work no matter what. As for excessively wet land, if the water can be retained, then planting rice is the best. Otherwise, drainage methods can be used to drain the water. There are two drainage methods: using covered ditches and using open ditches. We have not heard of using covered ditches for drainage in China. Using open ditches for drainage is very common. The organization of drainage and the organization of irrigation follow the same principle, which is to utilize the effect of water flowing from high places to low places.</p>
<p>The first step in improving mountainous land is to stop erosion. "Erosion" refers to the loss of topsoil due to the scouring of rainwater. The best way to prevent this kind of erosion is to make the land not sloped. However, it is impossible to dig up high ground and fill in low ground all at once, and it is not suitable for the soil. Therefore, the method of creating terraced fields can only gradually change the topography. If it is not easy to change the topography of mountainous land, it is best to let the area grow grass. The interest earned from good grass is not bad. If you want to grow food, at least do not plow up and down, but plow horizontally. Another problem with mountainous land is the lack of water storage capacity. To increase the water storage capacity, deep plowing should be done on the one hand, and humus should be increased on the other hand, because humus can retain water and resist erosion.</p>
<p>Soil that is too loose lacks clay. The remedy is to increase clay, which is a very practical method. We have a few examples to look at. In a place in northern Henan, the original soil was very fertile clay soil. After the Yellow River flooded, it was covered with a deep layer of sand. Now, the people who farm here often dig a ditch five or six feet deep to reach the clay. Then, they transport the clay underneath to the surface of the sand and then fill the ditch. They continue to dig and continue to fill, and the sandy soil becomes very good soil. Furthermore, the clay does not necessarily have to be dug up from underneath. Near Wuchang, there are also many sandy soils, and the mud from nearby small rivers is used to fill the surface, and their results are also very good. After sandy soil is improved with this method, it often becomes very good soil. This type of soil has a loose texture and considerable stickiness, making it especially suitable for growing vegetables, as well as orchards and nurseries. This method of improving soil may seem cumbersome, but the actual effect is very large. In the reclaimed salt fields of Jiangsu, there is also a method of turning the soil over, which is to turn over the soil with less salt content from below to the surface. I also saw the same practice in Hungary, Europe three months ago. The difference is that their reason for turning the soil has another effect. As for soil that is too sticky, in theory, sand should be added. However, I have not seen or heard of it in practice. The reason for this is probably that there is often no sand where there is a lot of clay. Even if there is a small amount of sand, it is not useful. It is not like adding some clay to sandy soil, which can make a big difference. According to what I think, if water can be accumulated in this type of place, rice should be planted. However, for smaller areas, such as those that are used for growing vegetables and flowers, which require less than two or three mu of land, then adding sand is also possible. In addition to adding sand, methods for improving clay soil also include adding sufficient humus. The nature of humus can make clay soil looser. If soil that is too loose is added with sufficient humus, it can also make it more sticky. Furthermore, humus can not only change the nature of being too sticky or too loose, but it is also a good fertilizer. Farm manure, human manure, compost, etc. are all humus. In addition, soil that is too sticky often prevents the drainage of water, so this type of soil is often too wet. Using drainage methods is also a way to improve clay soil.</p>
<p>Improving soil with a hardpan underneath depends on the type of hardpan. Generally speaking, there are two types of hardpan. One type is because there is a lot of clay in the bottom layer, which is called clay hardpan. The other type is because the substances that have seeped down from above have a chemical reaction and precipitate at the bottom. Therefore, the precipitated layer of soil is formed into a hardpan layer. This type of hardpan layer is sometimes very hard, like a stone. To deal with this type of hardpan layer, dynamite is sometimes used to break it up when planting fruit trees in the United States, and then it is planted again. However, the method of using dynamite is useless when encountering a clay hardpan layer. Because when the clay hardpan is blasted, although it is broken, it solidifies again after it rains. This type of soil can only be used to grow shallow-rooted crops. It cannot be expected to become a very good soil. In addition, there is no way to deal with soil that is too thin. Only shallow-rooted plants can be grown, or it can be left to grow grass, in the hope that it will slowly accumulate rotting grass and add weathering to make it deeper. At the very least, this thin layer of soil should not be lost again. I have seen in many places in the northeastern part of Jiangxi that the soil was initially thin and did not grow crops. Later, this thin layer of soil was also lost, and what is now seen are stone layers. This situation will take thousands of years to recover, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>The fifth type of natural soil is soil sodification. This problem is very long to talk about, so today I can only talk about it very simply. The reason why sodified soil is bad is that the soil contains salt. When salt stays in the soil for a long time, the sodium in the salt has a chemical reaction with the soil, then the nature of this soil becomes even worse. The methods of improving this type of soil are: first, cut off the source of salt; second, reduce the salt content in the soil; and third, if the sodium in the soil has a chemical reaction with the soil, then these sodiums must be taken out.</p>
<p>The soil improvement methods that I have purchased these two days have a wide range of content, and almost all of the most significant factors affecting soil have been included. If a piece of soil is bad, it does not necessarily have all the factors. Having one or two bad factors is already enough to suffer from. When you encounter practical problems, first identify the bad factors, analyze these factors, adapt to what should be adapted, and improve what can be improved. Sometimes adaptation and improvement can be carried out at the same time. In this way, the nature of the soil will naturally be better.</p>
<p>Finally, you must remember that a certain type of soil must have the most economical way to utilize it, and this method of utilization not only depends on the soil itself but also depends on various environments. We must first conduct a careful investigation and study of the environment before we can succeed.</p>

<h3>The Maekawa Fiscal Policy Following the Takahashi Fiscal Policy</h3>
<p>— Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<p>After the February 26th Incident in Japan, the current Hirota Cabinet was formed, and the central force supporting the Hirota Cabinet is the Maekawa fiscal policy.</p>
<p>The contradictions in Japanese society, economy, and politics can be explained by the February 26th Incident. However, let's not analyze the essence of these contradictions here. The point I want to emphasize here is that, since the February 26th Incident, Japan has further strengthened its active preparations for international warfare. The result of the February 26th Incident made the Okada Cabinet inevitably collapse. However, the new Prime Minister was none other than Foreign Minister Hirota, who had advocated "free international trade" and established the "Three Principles toward China" during the Okada Cabinet. The transformation from Foreign Minister Hirota to the Hirota Cabinet did not bring about fundamental changes in domestic and foreign policies. The main change is that the Okada Cabinet was still somewhat free from the control of the military, while the Hirota Cabinet completely obeyed the military's commands. When Hirota was about to receive the imperial order to form a cabinet, the rumor of the Hirota Cabinet aborting spread in newspaper extras, simply because the military stated that "Hirota's understanding of the extraordinary situation is insufficient." It was only when Hirota expressed his full acceptance of the military's guidance that the Hirota Cabinet was able to be established. Therefore, it can certainly be said that Hirota's understanding of the extraordinary situation is now very sufficient rather than insufficient, because he has agreed to strengthen national defense, expand industry, and intensify war preparations. However, how can these strengths be achieved? The foundation of strengthening is, of course, Japan's fiscal economy. Therefore, today's Maekawa fiscal policy has become the focus of attention from all parties. Maekawa is by no means an ordinary commoner; he was originally the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, a member of the House of Peers, and a so-called financial expert, and now he is also the Minister of Finance in the Hirota Cabinet. In Maekawa's declaration, the most important central point is to establish a fiscal policy to overcome the extraordinary situation. Under this extraordinary situation, the implementation of strengthening national defense is undoubtedly necessary. The so-called strengthening of national defense mainly means strengthening the army, navy, and air force. However, to strengthen national defense, there must be financial resources to strengthen national defense. Then, what methods will Maekawa use to raise such huge national defense expenses? Which people will be burdened with these huge military expenditures?</p>
<p>The former Minister of Finance Takahashi, who was sacrificed in the February 26th Incident, advocated a gradual reduction in public debt and believed that the time for tax increases had not yet arrived. However, today's Maekawa fiscal policy is in direct opposition to the Takahashi fiscal policy. Maekawa advocates increasing taxes and reforming the tax system, while also believing that bonds can be issued more. Increasing taxes and issuing more public bonds are the main methods for raising new financial resources. The methods for raising financial resources and the people who will bear the increased burden have already been decided, but the specific provisions have not yet been announced. However, since Maekawa's fiscal policy issued a statement on the ninth of this month, the failure to announce specific provisions in recent days has caused tremendous changes in the financial world. First, on March 11th, the prices of general stocks fell by a total of 350 million yuan. Second, the stocks of military-related industries, especially the shipbuilding industry, have soared. What does this change illustrate? First, it shows that this change is a reaction of some large asset holders and small and medium-sized asset holders against the controlled economy. The fiscal policy of strengthening national defense will inevitably lead to military, economic, and political control. This kind of controlled economy is an economic organization in which capitalism develops to the eve of international warfare, and it is also a kind of economic organization in which capital is more concentrated. Under this controlled economy, the freedom and profits of some capitalists will inevitably be forcibly restricted. One of the main reasons for the decline in stock prices is the preventive resistance to this coercion. At the same time, it also illustrates the citizens' fear of tax increases. Secondly, it shows that the international political crisis has deepened further. This crisis will further reduce the overseas markets, and the only outlet for the domestic market is the general military-related industry. Therefore, the stocks of military-related industries have soared, while others have tended to fall.</p>
<p>It can be said that this change is a demonstration by some financial circles against the Maekawa fiscal policy. However, this kind of demonstration is certainly not sustainable, because the foundation for national defense and industrial strengthening has been determined and recognized. Japan's military budget after 1937 will undoubtedly expand greatly. This is without question. When major changes began to occur in the financial world, Maekawa once declared to the financial world that his policies would never give the financial world a sudden blow. In other words, although taxes will be increased, the interests of the financial world will definitely be respected. This repeated declaration is of course intended to alleviate the resistance of some financial circles.</p>
<p>Currently, Maekawa has not mentioned the economic decline of Japanese rural areas or labor issues, but he has expressed attention to the stability of national life. In order to seek domestic political stability, it is not very cost-effective to impose heavier burdens on lower-level citizens (although it is inevitable in reality). Then, the result is still increasing domestic taxes on the one hand, while the most important aspect is to make fiscal and military policies go hand in hand, seeking rapid development abroad in the same direction.</p>
<p>Today, as the Italo-Ethiopian War has not yet ended, and Hitler has suddenly occupied the demilitarized Rhineland, the Maekawa fiscal policy is of course standing behind the marching trumpet in the East, making extremely urgent military preparations. (By Ishikawa, March 4th)</p>
<h3>Macau: Sudden Explosion at a Fireworks Factory; Over a Hundred Workers Killed or Injured; Property Loss Exceeds Ten Thousand</h3>
<p>Macau Correspondence: The Guangyuan Fireworks Factory on the mountain road in Taipa, Macau, suddenly exploded in the medicine-mixing department on the afternoon of the 12th, affecting other departments. The number of employees killed or injured reached one hundred. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unexpected Explosion</p>
<p>At 2:12 p.m. on the 12th, while the workers in each department were working, the medicine-mixing department suddenly exploded due to unknown carelessness. The sound was loud and continuous, followed by a fire. Except for parts of the gunpowder mixing room, fuse-making room, kitchen, and dormitory being blown up, the rest were shaken and collapsed completely. When the explosion occurred, the workers heard the sound and frantically searched for ways to escape, in extreme disarray. When the people of Taipa heard the loud noise, they immediately knew that an accident had occurred at the firecracker factory and closed their doors. It took a long time after the event for things to gradually return to normal. It was found that 23 people were killed or crushed on the spot, including both men and women, and children (it was found that the factory did not hire children to work, but children automatically went to insert fuses for the workers in order to make small profits, earning three or four copper coins per firecracker). A total of 68 male and female workers and children were seriously injured, and countless were slightly injured. At that time, the cries shook the sky, and the entire Taipa was in an uproar. The explosion was felt even in Macau, showing the strength of the impact.</p>
<p>Rescue Efforts After the incident, all members of the Taipa Fire Brigade and all civil and military officials of the government set out to rescue the victims. The Mayor of the Islands, Mr. Batalha, also personally went to the scene to direct the rescue efforts. After receiving the news, the Macau Fire Department immediately dispatched eight members from District 1 and seven members from District 2, led by Director Costa and Deputy Director Amulian, to assist in the rescue by ferry. Because of the large number of injured people, over ten people, including the national doctor, Mr. Ristich, nurses from the Hilltop Hospital, and the Kiang Wu Hospital ambulance team, also continued to cross the sea to provide assistance. The Deputy Director of the Marine and Customs Bureau and the District Chief of Fire District 1 directed everything at the Royal Pier in Barra, and the people watching the pier were like ants gathered there. A total of three ambulances from the Fire Department and Kiang Wu Hospital were waiting at the pier. Whenever an electric boat brought the injured, they were transported to the Hilltop and Bai Ma Hang hospitals for treatment. When the ambulances were racing on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro and other streets, the people watching from both sides of the road were extremely crowded. At that time, it was drizzling, and the sky was dim, as if the heavens were also weeping for this unfortunate event. After the Macau Fire Department arrived, they immediately opened hoses to extinguish the fire, and it was not until around 5 p.m. that the fire was completely extinguished. At that time, the area near the factory was covered with firecracker paper shells and rubble.</p>
<p>A Hundred Killed or Injured</p>
<p>Two thatched huts at the entrance of the Three Family Village near the factory were also burned down. The neighboring Kian Un Firecracker Factory was shaken by the explosion, collapsing several sections of the wall. The garden of lawyer Lei Teng was also damaged. After the fire was extinguished, firefighters immediately began digging and found 23 bodies on the spot, all with broken heads and limbs, in a very tragic state. Sixty-eight seriously injured people were rescued, and the rescuers were busy. They were immediately transported to Macau by electric ferry for treatment. It was estimated that by the morning of the 13th, another 13 injured people had died. Among the dead, only the factory's bookkeeper, Li Jie, could be identified. The rest were a bloody mess and could not be identified. All the bodies were taken to the morgue to await identification. Subsequently, the authorities, realizing that the excavation work was extremely difficult and fearing that someone might still be buried alive, telegraphed the Macau Public Works Bureau to dispatch 26 workers, led by engineer Bido, to assist in the rapid excavation. The excavation is still underway. Macau firefighters also worked until around 9 p.m. before returning to Macau. Afterwards, in order to find out the names of the dead and injured, the police authorities dispatched several policemen to investigate household by household whether anyone worked at the Guangyuan Factory, in order to register them and summoned the factory's executives to inquire about everything.</p>
<p>Loss Investigation</p>
<p>It was found that a total of 91 people were killed or injured in the incident, which was more tragic than the explosion at a firecracker factory last year. The victims had charred heads and broken foreheads, and their bodies were separated, which was unbearable to witness. Regarding the aftermath, according to Li Yi, the founder and assistant foreman of the company, "Due to this unfortunate event, the company's losses have reached more than 100,000 yuan. The company will certainly provide appropriate compensation to the workers who died in the accident. We have now telegraphed the manager Liu Yiting, who is in Taishan, to return to Macau to handle everything. The company will immediately prepare coffins for the dead, and the company will also be responsible for the medical treatment of those with minor injuries. The company will also provide food for those who are temporarily homeless." The cause of the factory's carelessness is being investigated. As for the factory's foreman, Tan Nan, he escaped quickly during the incident and was only slightly injured by being hit by a brick.</p>
<p>Factory History</p>
<p>The Guangyuan Firecracker Factory is located on the road in Taipa, with a factory area of ​​50 acres. It is a partnership business, managed by Liu Yiting. The official capital is 10,000 yuan, but the additional amount reaches 50,000 yuan. It has been in operation for eight years, and its sales are mainly in the South Seas. The factory's Hong Kong agent is Wing Cheong, and Macau also has an office in Chai Sem Vui. The factory has a total of more than 160 workers, with female workers accounting for over 120. The interior of the factory is divided into eight gunpowder warehouses, one black and white gunpowder room, one warehouse, three blasting rooms, one fuse-making room, one firecracker shell room, one spring medicine room, one fuse-making room, one firecracker wrapping room, one mud room, and separate worker dormitories (for male workers), kitchens, and offices. In addition to manufacturing firecrackers itself, the factory also leases part of the factory to other firecracker manufacturers. This department has another 40 female workers working on site. This tragic incident occurred. It is said that only 10 of the 40 female workers in the department survived, all with minor injuries. It is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Guangdong and Hubei (9)</h3>
<p>(Travel correspondence from our reporter) From Lechang to Guangzhou</p>
<p>After arriving in Lechang, one notable thing at the station was that women made up two-thirds of all porters, while men were few and far between. Most of the female porters were barefoot, unusually strong, and carried dozens of kilograms of luggage as if it were nothing. Such a situation is not only unheard of in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but also never seen in the North. Gender equality should start with balanced work. Female porters are truly commendable.</p>
<p>The Zhuzhou-Shaozhou section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway originally started from Shaozhou in Guangdong and ended in Zhuzhou in Hunan. However, the section between Shaozhou and Lechang (i.e., the first section) had already been completed and handed over to the Guangzhou-Shaozhou Railway Bureau. Therefore, our arrival in Lechang can be said to be the end point of the Zhuzhou-Shaozhou Engineering Bureau and also the starting point of the Guangzhou-Shaozhou Railway Bureau. While in Hunan Province, from Changsha to Xiaotang (the border between Hunan and Guangdong), we talked with various people, and there were no communication barriers. However, upon entering Pingshi in Guangdong, we felt a slight disconnect. By the time we reached Lechang, it was completely Guangdongized. Since the language was difficult to understand, we had to rely heavily on gestures and travel like mutes. Fortunately, Mr. He Jingcong, an inspector from the Zhuzhou-Shaozhou Bureau, accompanied us to Guangzhou, acting as an interpreter, so there were no difficulties.</p>
<p>Lechang is a major town on the Beijiang River. The roads are mostly cement, but there are no rickshaws. People rely solely on walking. It takes only ten minutes to walk from the station to the city center. The first thing that catches the eye is the abundance of opium dens, such as the Baiyun Opium Den and the Yunxia Rehabilitation Center, almost facing each other, everywhere. In addition, Silver Card Fan Tan is also visible everywhere. Among the restaurants, female waitresses are popular, and a large sign is displayed at the entrance, boldly proclaiming "Newly arrived female workers from Guangzhou and Hong Kong" as a selling point, as if inlanders from Jiangsu and Zhejiang recognize women from Shanghai and Hangzhou as the most fashionable. Prostitution is also prevalent here. The prostitutes mostly reside on flower boats, similar to the Jiangshan boats. The sound of flutes and pipes is loud on the water, and those who enjoy pleasure often linger here. In the evening, Mr. He led us to the Yuehan Hotel, which is the largest hotel in Lechang, but it is extremely dirty. The second floor is a restaurant, with people coming and going in a mixed manner. The hotel portion is on the third and fourth floors. Because there is no electricity, the gas lamps are intensely glaring. In the neighboring room, card games continue all night, with laughter, scolding, and anger mixed together. Although we do not understand the language, we can guess that it is a scene of winning and losing accounts.</p>
<p>To go to Guangdong from here, you need to exchange silver dollar notes. The exchange shops in Lechang are most happy to accept the legal currency of the Bank of China, and the exchange rate is also higher. Although other banks' legal currency is also accepted, the price difference is one dime per yuan. Travelers should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>There are many soldiers stationed in Lechang, and the discipline is excellent. When soldiers engage in prostitution, the officers wait outside the door and whip their buttocks on the spot when they come out. Many people watch, and the soldiers are ashamed, so they dare not go again. Punishing one as a warning to a hundred is an excellent and interesting method.</p>
<p>On the morning of the tenth, we set off at dawn and went to the station. Near the station, bugles were blaring loudly, and the soldiers were drilling. The Guangdong Province's military mobilization can be seen from this. At 7:00, the Guangzhou-Shaozhou train departed and arrived in Guangzhou at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>After arriving in Guangzhou, we spent a day visiting various scenic spots. The thing that moved me the most was the newly built Anti-Japanese Memorial Monument for the 19th Route Army. I lingered and gazed at it, reluctant to leave. The next day, we took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Hong Kong, and then traveled from Hong Kong to Macau and Shiqi for a short trip. We passed through Cuiheng Village and visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's former residence. On the 14th, we boarded the President Jefferson from Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on the 16th. In summary, I left Shanghai on the 28th of last month and returned for a total of eighteen days. Although the time was short, the news and interests I gained were abundant. Travel is a moving school, and it is not an empty word.</p>
<h3>Henan River Affairs Bureau Intensifies Dyke Reinforcement and Dam Repair to Prevent Yellow River Breaching During the Flood Season</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: In the past three years, the Yellow River has breached consecutively in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong. Although the Huangzhuang damming project is expected to be completed, the riverbanks of the three provinces will inevitably suffer further breaches during the flood season. To prevent such disasters, the Henan River Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the dyke restoration conference held last year, established two emergency engineering offices in Chenqiao and Lankao on the 18th of last month. Construction in Chenqiao began on the 5th of this month and is expected to be completed by the end of June. The Lankao section, from Guoying to the Hebei provincial border, was originally planned to use soil from locations that are now young beaches, making transportation difficult and likely damaging the dam. Therefore, alternative soil extraction points have been designated. To stay within the original budget, the slope will be changed from 2.5 to 2.0, and construction can begin immediately, with completion expected in February. The original decision to repair the Songshui Dam in Gouzhai Village, Wen County, was deemed unnecessary by the River Affairs Inspection Team. The entire budget will be redirected to repairing seven dams (numbers 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13) and ten revetments in the Zhaozhuang Village people's embankment, under the jurisdiction of the South Branch Bureau. Furthermore, the soil quality in the area is extremely poor, and dykes six meters wide are insufficient to withstand major floods. It is proposed to increase the width of all dykes to ten meters. To prevent danger to the new Yangzhuang dyke, it has been decided to build the Chenlan Flood Dykes passing Lei Ji, Later Lei Ji, and Old Lord Temple, totaling 2,500 meters. The missing dyke of five *li* between Sanyi Village and the old Xiaoxin Dyke will also be connected, and three water-drawing dams will be built on the Dongba head, with repairs to two dams. The above projects are estimated to require 300,000 yuan, and a request has been submitted to the provincial government for allocation. Work will begin separately upon receipt of funds. (17th)</p>
<p>Songjiang Sends Personnel to Supervise Mass Literacy</p>
<p>Mass compulsory literacy education has been ordered by the county government to all districts, with one literacy class to be established in each township. All districts have complied. The county government has now formulated supervisory measures and a supervisory form, and has designated Shen Jizhou for District One, Fang Yuanxiang for District Two, Zhang Yande for District Three, Zhang Baozong for District Four, Xiang Zhilian for District Five, Shen Ping for District Six, Wu Chengtiao for District Seven, and Zhang Mingguang for District Eight as supervisors for the mass literacy classes. They will depart separately on March 21st with the supervisory forms.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Goes to Punan to Supervise General Inspection</p>
<p>The general inspection of opium addicts in all districts has led to the discovery of hundreds of opium addicts in recent days. They have all been sent for verification. County Magistrate Li went to Caojing, Shanyang, and Xieshi in Punan yesterday to supervise the township and *baojia* heads in all districts to complete the general inspection in order to find any omitted opium users.</p>
<p>Suzhou County Government Emphasizes Public Security</p>
<p>Wu County Magistrate Deng Xianghai convened a meeting of the Public Security Bureau chief and staff in the Huangtang of the county government at 10:00 AM on the 19th to give important instructions. He emphasized that the county is located at the intersection of the Jinghu and Sujia railways, and the Sujia, Suchang, Shuhu, and Suxi highways, making the responsibility of the public security organs very significant. Measures must be taken to strengthen defenses. In the short term, it is planned to form and supplement the firearm team and strengthen patrols. The meeting lasted two hours.</p>
<p>County Government Does Not Intend to Tighten Budget</p>
<p>The county's budget for this year originally used a standard of 92% for land taxes. Later, due to the severity of disasters in various townships, it was changed to 80% collection, resulting in a shortfall of over 70,000 yuan. The Department of Finance ordered the cancellation of the first reserve fund and a tightening of all expenditures. On the 19th, the county government stated that although land tax revenue was short, the revenue from deed taxes and other items was significantly higher, so there was no need for tightening. A detailed report has been submitted to the Department of Finance.</p>
<p>Scandal of Master-Servant Adultery Case: Female Protagonist Summoned</p>
<p>Xi Yunqing, the married daughter of Shanghai paint merchant Xi, is involved in an adultery case with a chauffeur, which has been appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court will summon the female protagonist, Xi Yunqing, to court on the 26th of this month at 2:00 PM for continued hearing.</p>
<p>Public Prostitution to Be Implemented on April 1st</p>
<p>In order to crack down on private prostitution, the Public Security Bureau has obtained approval from the Department of Civil Affairs to implement a pilot program for public prostitution. It was originally scheduled to start on March 1st, but the opening date was delayed due to procedural delays. The examination of prostitutes for syphilis is nearing completion. According to Section Chief Fan of the Public Security Bureau, business licenses for prostitutes will be issued soon, and the opening is scheduled for April 1st. The total number of prostitutes is 181, mostly second-class. Regarding donation payment, it is divided into two categories: brothels and prostitutes. Brothels are divided into three classes, paying annual donations: first class 20 yuan, second class 10 yuan, third class 5 yuan. Prostitutes pay monthly donations: first class 5 yuan, second class 3 yuan, third class 1 yuan. These donations will be collected by the county government's local donation office to show fiscal unity. Currently, everyone is busy renting and arranging designated houses and rooms.</p>
<p>Two Lawsuits Against *Daguangming Daily*</p>
<p>The Suzhou *Daguangming Daily* previously published an article about Dong Jianzhi, the leader of the First Platoon of the Fourth Branch of the Commercial Group, allegedly abusing the collection of donations. Dong Jianzhi believed it was slander and sued Yan Yisheng, the director of the newspaper, in the Wu County District Court. After repeated summons by the court, the verdict was issued yesterday that Yan Yisheng and Zou Bingzhong were innocent. In another case, the newspaper's editor Feng Pingying was sued for libel by Zhang Yipeng and other gentry for the issue of local public welfare donations. The court sentenced Feng Pingying to 50 days of detention. Feng appealed the original verdict to the High Court and has been approved. The hearing will begin soon.</p>
<p>Supervisory Office Secretly Investigates the Case of Wu Qiyun</p>
<p>Former Wu County Magistrate Wu Qiyun handed over his post a week ago. Local figures Li Genyuan and Zhang Yi, etc., sent a letter to Wu requesting the public announcement of the county's finances handled by him in order to show good faith. Wu did not give a clear response at the time. Then, Wu Yunzhong, etc., submitted a petition to the provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office, requesting strict orders for Wu Qiyun to publicly announce the finances. It is heard that Supervisory Envoy Ding Chao Wu sent personnel to Suzhou yesterday for a secret investigation. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is also conducting a secret investigation.</p>
<p>Wuxi Villager Gan Douli Drives Away Bandits</p>
<p>In Maqueyuan, Shen Dongmian, Bashi Bridge, Sixth District of the county, resident Yu Gengquan, 36 years old, is a farmer. He usually practices martial arts such as lifting stone weights, so he is exceptionally strong. At about 8 PM the night before, six bandits suddenly came to Yu's house, each holding weapons, and entered through the back door. They first dragged Yu's farmhand, Shi Quan, from the bed and forbade him from making a sound, then tied him up with ropes. Two other bandits immediately went into Gengquan's room, intending to rob him. However, Yu had already been secretly hiding behind the room door, holding the door panel in his hand. He struck the head of the first bandit entering the room. When the remaining bandits found out, they wrestled with Yu at the door for about ten minutes. The bandits, unable to withstand him, fired three shots with their pistols. Yu fought back while dodging bullets, resulting in a gunshot wound to his left leg. He endured the pain and continued to fight, seizing a small chamber pot and shoving it over the bandit's head, covering the bandit's face with excrement. At that moment, the neighbors on the left and right heard the noise and shouted, and the crowd gathered. The bandits fled.</p>
<p>Changshu Railway Station Chief Poisons Himself with Pufferfish</p>
<p>Lu Boquan, the railway station chief of Zhitang in the county, is a native of Taicang. Unexpectedly, the night before, he ate four pufferfish alone during dinner. He was fine that night and went to work as usual the next morning. On the morning of the 19th, he took a train to Beijing on official business. However, when the train passed the Dangre station, Lu's abdomen started to ache and swell. In a short time, it spread throughout his body, and he became delirious. Seeing his condition, the driver stopped the train and reported to Shen Xiexian, the Changshu station chief. Shen observed his condition and knew he was poisoned, so he dispatched a small chartered car to take Lu to the Taicang Hospital for treatment. It is said that he is alive.</p>
<p>Changzhou Spring Silkworm Rearing: More Guidance Centers Established</p>
<p>The Wuyi sericulture improvement zone has set the target for spring silkworm eggs at 140,000 sheets. Over 120,000 sheets have already been ordered, and the ordering period for the remaining 10,000 sheets is about to expire, and orders will cease after that. Deputy Director He Zhaoxi of the zone stated that with the spring silkworm season approaching, the guidance centers in various townships need to be established urgently. Last year, three central guidance centers and over 20 ordinary guidance centers were established. For wider coverage, 46 additional ordinary guidance centers will be established this year, and the guidance personnel have also been determined. They will depart for work after a meeting on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Love-Training Social Education Personnel Salary</p>
<p>Social education organizations in various counties of Jiangsu have been ordered to close down one after another. The education bureaus of each county are responsible for the custody, and the social education personnel will be transferred to the province for centralized training. These personnel are united in their concerns regarding their livelihood during the training period and are appealing. They have also requested that the salaries of the dismissed staff be paid up to July. The training personnel will continue to receive their salaries. According to news from the provincial office, it has now been decided that the personnel coming to the province for training will receive half of their original salary.

<h3>Zhejiang Banking and Money Industries Telegraph Shanghai Counterparts Urging Joint Efforts to Uphold Credit Zhejiang Department of Finance Has Borrowed Over 10 Million Yuan Over the Years Bonds Account for Nine-Tenths of the Collateral</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, as of November 11th of the 24th year, the outstanding debts of the Zhejiang Department of Finance to banks and money houses in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places are as follows: 2,936,528.64 yuan to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Banking Group, 1,985,480.38 yuan to the Shanghai Banking Group, 560,000 yuan to the Central Bank, 748,937.241 yuan to the China Farmers Bank, 4,801,395.64 yuan to various banks and money houses in Hangzhou, 75,000 yuan to the Shaoxing banking and money industry, 34,000 yuan to the Jiaxing banking and money industry, 60,000 yuan to Yin Zhi, 22,553.66 yuan to the Yuyao banking and money industry, 30,000 yuan to Changxing, totaling 11,253,795.561 yuan. More than nine-tenths of the total amount is collateralized by various bonds. The Hangzhou Banking and Money Industries Association telegraphed the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Association seeking assistance to maintain credit, stating that the Shanghai Banking and Money Industries Association has found that the bonds issued by Zhejiang Province currently include seven types: old debt repayment public bonds, highway public bonds, construction public bonds, disaster relief public bonds, debt clearing public bonds, provincial treasury notes, and local public bonds. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance has borrowed more than 11 million yuan from the banking and money industry. Recently, there have been rumors that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance intends to reduce interest rates and extend the principal on various bonds and change the contracts for various loans, causing widespread panic. If what is heard is true and actually occurs, the social economy will experience chaos and panic. The association is nominally in charge of Zhejiang's finances, especially at a time when the market is sluggish. It is necessary to treat Zhejiang bonds with caution to avoid panic. In order to stabilize the social economy, the association, in addition to separately submitting requests to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Central Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original plan, is also sending a telegram to your association, asking you to consider the blood and sweat of the bondholders and the dignity of contractual credit, and to jointly appeal on the grounds that the Zhejiang bonds cannot be reorganized and the loans cannot have changed contracts in order to maintain credit and uphold the rule of law. It would be greatly appreciated by the Hangzhou Banking Association and the Hangzhou Money Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Bank Draft Acceptance House Agreement of Bank Members Banks Joining Must Sign and Pay Funds The Original is Retained by the Association and Each Has a Copy</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Bank Draft Acceptance House was officially established and started operations on the 16th, it has received quite a few acceptance drafts in recent days. The committee is currently reviewing them. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency recorded the agreements of the bank members of the association, as follows:</p>
<p>The parties who acknowledge the fund (the banks that sign on this agreement) have joined the Bank Draft Acceptance House (hereinafter referred to as "the House") of the Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee (hereinafter referred to as "the Association") as member banks and have agreed on the following terms for compliance: 1.

The draft acceptance fund acknowledged by the parties shall be paid in full, of which 5% shall be paid in cash and deposited in the House as a reserve, and the remaining 95% shall be deposited by the House in the original payment bank. Interest may be appropriately given on the cash deposited in the House by the member banks, but no interest shall be calculated on the draft acceptance fund deposited by the House in the original payment bank.</p>
<p>Responsibility 1. The parties shall be liable for the House's acceptance business in proportion to the amount of the draft acceptance fund acknowledged, within the total amount. All losses incurred by the House due to draft acceptance shall be distributed by the parties in proportion to the amount of the draft acceptance fund acknowledged, within the total amount. When the House is required to advance cash due to the drawer's failure to fulfill the acceptance agreement when the payment of the permanent draft is due, it shall be paid immediately by the parties from the reserve fund deposited in the House. If it is insufficient, it shall be advanced by the parties in proportion to the amount of the draft acceptance fund deposited in the House within the total amount.</p>
<p>Agency Obligations The following matters may be entrusted by the House to the parties for handling. The parties shall have the obligation to act as agents upon entrustment by the House: 1.

When the drawer fails to fulfill the acceptance agreement, the goods shall be transported and sold to offset it.

Request to withdraw, which is approved by the General Assembly of Committee Bank Representatives of the Association; 2. The qualification as a member bank is revoked by a joint resolution of other parties due to a violation of this agreement or other reasons; 3. When business is suspended for liquidation. After the party loses its qualification as a member bank, it shall still be liable for the acceptance business of the House prior to the loss of qualification of the party, in accordance with Article 3 of this agreement. When a party loses its qualification as a member bank, the acceptance fund it has acknowledged shall be returned by the House after the liability stipulated in Article 3 of this agreement has been extinguished.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Was Replied by the Ministry of Industry Rules for Silver Use Cannot Be Changed</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, upon the request of Ran Xizhang and other representatives of the National Silver Industry, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government on the 2nd of this month, requesting permission to change the rules for silver use in order to maintain the livelihoods of silver workers, etc. The Ministry of Finance replied that it would be handled according to the previous instructions, as reported earlier. It is now known that the Association received a document No. 15077 from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that in a telegram dated March 3, 25, the representatives of the National Silver Industry, Ran Xizhang, etc., requested to change the rules for silver use, to remove restrictions on the silver composition, and to maintain the livelihoods of silver workers. It was requested to be approved. Chemical silver has been popular for manufacturing utensils and ornaments for a long time. Mechanical manufacturing is more convenient, but manual manufacturing will inevitably feel slightly difficult at first due to unfamiliarity. However, given some time, it is possible to find ways to improve. As for the rules for silver use, it concerns the entire economic policy of the country and it is inappropriate to request for it to be changed. Please inform the silver industry representatives of this reply.</p>
<h3>No More Joint Meetings To Be Jointly Reported to the Ministry of Finance Next Week by Two Associations</h3>
<p>For the sake of commercial revitalization and market prosperity in the city, industrial and commercial leaders Qin Zhaqing, Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, etc., previously requested the Ministry of Finance to instruct the banking and money industries to reduce loan interest rates to provide relief. Since receiving this instruction, the banking and money industries associations have organized small subcommittees to study this matter repeatedly. The two associations also planned to hold a joint meeting to discuss specific matters in order to report to the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou of the Banking Association told a reporter from the National News Agency that the two associations have now reached a consensus and there is no need to hold a joint meeting again. This report can be sent out next week.</p>
<h3>Spring Silkworm Seeds Distributed Today: Three Provinces Borrow from Shanghai Banks a Total of 15 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Kuomin News Agency, the National Economic Council's Silk Improvement Association has been making extraordinary efforts to promote improved sericulture since its establishment. The current chairman of the association is Mr. Zeng Yangfu. Italian silk expert Dr. Mari is also an advisor to the association. The work of improvement includes cultivating talent, sending personnel for guidance, and researching various aspects of silk improvement. Currently, there is a silk academy and experimental field in Nanjing, and model sericulture fields are established in Hangzhou and other places. In recent years, active progress has been made in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces to improve silkworm breeds, with some achievements already realized. This year, it has been decided to continue this progress, while also paying special attention to provinces where improved silkworm breeds have not yet been promoted, such as Guangdong province, which is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Borrowing a Huge Sum It is also reported by banking circles in this city that the Silk Control Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces intends to borrow 15 million yuan from local banking circles in order to jointly control cocoon purchasing and thoroughly implement improved cocoon purchasing methods. This is currently underway. Whether this matter can be realized depends on the success of the loan. According to banking circles, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have previously borrowed money from Shanghai banking circles for cocoon purchasing, and their credit is excellent. If there is sufficient collateral for this year's loan, the loan can be approved.</p>
<p>Start of Seed Distribution This year's spring silkworm season has been slightly delayed due to excessive rainfall and cold weather. The spring silkworm preparations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are sufficient, and seed distribution will begin on the 20th of this month. The personnel dispatched by the two provinces' Silk Control Association to guide sericulture have already begun to depart, guiding silk farmers in disinfection work. According to silk experts, the prolonged cold this spring, if not followed by ten days of sunny and warm weather, will hinder the development of spring silkworms.</p>
<h3>Coastal Weather Improves: Guangzhou-Shanghai Route Resumes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangzhou route of the China National Aviation Corporation has been repeatedly delayed due to adverse weather conditions along the coast for the past half-month. According to the company yesterday, the weather conditions in Hangzhou Bay have improved, so the southbound mail plane departed from Longhua Airport at 6:30 yesterday morning. However, yesterday was originally a northbound flight schedule, but there were no planes stationed in Guangzhou, so no planes flew to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's New Wulin Steamer Out of Danger: Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>

The company's Wenzhou steamer went to tow it but was unsuccessful. Yesterday (the 19th), due to a large rise in the river level, the Wulin took the opportunity to run at full speed and successfully extricated itself, although it was one and a half days late.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Forcefully Performs His Duties Despite Illness</h3>

The young postal worker Yang Ling fought bravely against the enemy and sacrificed his life for the Party and the country on March 21st of that year. During the "January 28th Incident" in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the Shanghai postal workers participated in the national salvation work, such as organizing rescue teams and transportation teams. The postal workers Lu Chunhua, Chen Zude, and Pan Jiaji sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. In order to commend their loyalty and pay tribute to their heroic souls, the National Postal Workers' General Union specially purchased a piece of land in the suburbs of Nanxiang, where the martyrs died, to build a martyrs' cemetery. Taking advantage of the gathering of national postal workers' representatives in Shanghai, they held a groundbreaking ceremony to express their condolences and for memorial purposes.

At the front of the cemetery, there is a white cloth archway with the words "Eternal Immortality" written on it. Below, a white cloth banner is hung with the words "Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Postal Workers' Martyrs' Cemetery." The cemetery is surrounded by bamboo, and in the center, there is a white cloth memorial tablet and altar, on which are enshrined the portraits of the four martyrs. In front, there is a stone tablet with the six characters "Postal Workers' Martyrs' Cemetery." The atmosphere was solemn and dignified. After the representatives arrived, the ceremony began, with Zhu Xuefan presiding over the ceremony, Zhang Guangdai reading the eulogy, and Zhu Yinghua acting as master of ceremonies. They sang the union song, paid the highest respect (three bows) to the Party and the national flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister, the presiding officer respectfully read the Prime Minister's will, paid respect (one bow) to the portraits of the martyrs, observed three minutes of silence in mourning (ringing the bell), laid flowers, read the eulogy, laid the foundation stone, planted bamboo, took photographs, completed the ceremony, and played music. After the ceremony, all the representatives returned to Shanghai in the original vehicles and had lunch at the Zhimei Building on Fourth Avenue.</p>
<p>Visiting the Municipal Government At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, all the representatives went to the city center to visit the municipal government. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhou of the municipal government warmly received them and guided them to visit various places, such as the auditorium, cafeteria, library, and the model of the new Shanghai city. Then they paid their respects in front of the statue of the Prime Minister, and then visited the city sports field and swimming pool. After the visit, they took the original vehicle to visit the Kangyuan Can Factory and the Yapuer Electric Appliance Factory. According to the original schedule, they also planned to visit the Huafu Hat Factory and other places, but due to the local association's banquet tonight and the limited time, it was temporarily canceled.</p>

<h3>Concession Telephone Company Notifies All Users to Pay Fees According to New Regulations</h3>
<p>The Telephone Problem Committee Asks Brokers to Refuse Payment First and Urges the Taxpayers' Association to Convene a General Meeting to Seek a Solution</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the telephone price increase, the Concession Telephone Company has already notified all users separately to pay fees according to the new system. The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Stock Exchange Brokers' Association, asking them to refuse payment, and also sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association, urging them to convene a general meeting to seek a fundamental solution. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce agreed to submit the request to convene a meeting of representatives from various industries to the Executive Committee for discussion and decision. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Refusal of Payment The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Stock Exchange Brokers' Association of this city, asking them to refuse payment. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented the new fee system, the society has been in an uproar, causing unrest. Letters have been sent to us one after another, voicing difficulties and requesting a solution. Our association has repeatedly written to the Public Works Department and the company, requesting them to take into account the current situation of society and the spirit of cooperation, and to cancel the new system in order to maintain public opinion. However, they have refused to listen, resulting in a stalemate. We have read in the newspapers that your association convened a joint meeting and decided on four measures to negotiate with the telephone company, which shows that your association is advocating for the users of the city, and we deeply admire you. However, the company is blinded by profit, and it is not enough to persuade them to reflect without taking effective measures. Although your industry's transactions rely on communication tools, if you can unify your will and remove all the telephones, and replace them with hired workers, it will not affect the transactions. Therefore, we are sending this letter, urging you to advocate for all users and refuse to pay the telephone bill for this month, so that we can work together to achieve the final victory."</p>
<p>Urging the Convening of a Taxpayers' Association The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee yesterday sent another letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, urging them to convene a general meeting. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, regarding the new regulations for telephones in the Special Zone, it has only been implemented for two weeks, and the impact on various industries is beyond expectations. This association has repeatedly received requests for relief from users in various districts. However, the matter concerns the entire market in the Concession area, and it is not enough to rely on the power of all taxpayers. We have read in the newspapers that the executive members of your association have successively requested the convening of a meeting of taxpayers' representatives, and have sent several letters requesting the convening of a general meeting of taxpayers to discuss countermeasures. However, several weeks have passed and no [action] has been taken. People's organizations rely on public opinion. Now the telephone problem has become a serious situation, and the majority of parks unanimously advocate submitting it to the taxpayers' general meeting for discussion. If your association ignores public sentiment and puts aside matters related to public interests, it will fail the expectations of the taxpayers. Therefore, we are sending this letter again, urging you to pay attention to public opinion and convene the taxpayers' general meeting as soon as possible to discuss it, in order to achieve the goal of cancellation. This matter is important, and we hope for your reply."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Replies to Citizens' Association The Citizens' Association of the First Special Zone, for the issue of telephone price increases, asked the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of representatives from various industries to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, they received a reply from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, agreeing to submit it to the Executive Committee for discussion and decision. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, on the 17th of this month, we received your letter stating that the Concession Telephone Company has secretly increased prices since March 1st by changing the fee system. You requested that this association convene a meeting of members' representatives to discuss countermeasures. The matter was submitted to the 82nd Standing Committee meeting. According to the constitution of this association, there are two types of members' meetings: regular meetings and temporary meetings. Regular meetings are held once a year in mid-June, and the date has not yet arrived. The convening of temporary meetings requires a request from more than one-tenth of the members' representatives or a letter from the supervisory committee, and the Executive Committee must consider it necessary before it can be convened. It was resolved to submit the letter to the Executive Committee meeting for discussion. We are sending this reply for your information."</p>
<h3>New Jiangtian Steamer Collides with Sailing Boat Case: Collision Committee Interrogates Yesterday</h3>
<p>Further Investigation Required, Further Interrogation to be Held Next Time</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's New Jiangtian Steamer collided with the Jinwanli sailing boat on the sea off the Y窝沙沙 of the Wusongkou at 4:00 AM on the 18th of last month. The sailing boat immediately took on water and sank, drowning three people. The matter has been reported to the Maritime Affairs Bureau by both parties, requesting instructions from the Ministry of Communications. Subsequently, the Ministry ordered the Bureau's Collision Committee to handle the matter carefully. The Bureau held a meeting of the Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee at 2:00 PM yesterday to conduct a public hearing.</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>The attending members yesterday included Peng Hu, Director of the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and committee members Chen Ganqing, Chen Baoyan, and He Dao. Also present were Hu Hanwu and Shi Jisheng. The interrogated were Qiao Hengsheng, captain of the New Jiangtian Steamer, Yu Tingyuan, acting first mate, Lou Jiaxing, marine engineer, Chen Tianqing, captain of the Jinwanli sailing boat, and Luo Xingchun, shipowner.</p>
<p>Shipowner's Statement</p>
<p>Qiao Hengsheng J.H. Johnson, captain of the New Jiangtian Steamer, stated that he is a Norwegian national, 42 years old. The New Jiangtian Steamer departed from Ningbo for Shanghai at 4:00 PM on February 17th. From 8:00 PM to 8:20 PM, he was on duty as a pilot. At the Lisonore Buoy, the second mate was on duty. At a quarter to 5:00 AM on the 18th, the helmsman called me up. I immediately put on my clothes and got up. Suddenly, I heard a very violent collision. I hurriedly put on my clothes and went to the bridge, only to realize that the steamer had collided with a sailing boat. At that time, I found the left engine running fast forward and the right engine stopped, but the rudder had already been turned hard to starboard. Because I saw a ship at anchor about two ship lengths away directly in front, I quickly ordered the engine to stop. At the same time, I changed the order to run the right engine fast forward and the left engine fast reverse, and turned the rudder hard to port to avoid the freighter. After it was clear, I began to search for the sunken sailing boat. At about 6:00 AM, I saw the sailing boat, but there was no one on board. I had no choice but to sail to Shanghai. At that time, the tide was rising and the wind direction was northeast.</p>
<p>Helmsman's Statement</p>
<p>Lou Jiaxu, helmsman of the New Jiangtian, stated that he is 46 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He has been a helmsman for six years. At 4:00 AM on February 18th, when passing the Black House buoy, I was on the bridge, on duty as helmsman. The first course was W/Ni/4N. At that time, the second mate was on duty on the bridge. After I turned the rudder hard to starboard, the New Jiangtian collided with the sailing boat. After the collision, the captain came to the bridge. The captain ordered hard to port to avoid the anchored ship directly in front, and then began to search for the sailing boat. At about 6:00 AM, when it was daylight, I saw the sunken sailing boat, with only the mast exposed above the water. There was no one on board. The New Jiangtian then sailed to Shanghai. I pulled the whistle once before giving the rudder command.</p>
<p>Search for Evidence</p>
<p>The first mate Yu Tingyuan and the second mate Long Hai were also summoned. They both stated that at 4:40 AM on the 17th, when passing the Black House, they caught a glimpse of an anchored ship on the left and a dark shadow in the right front. Looking through binoculars, they realized it was a sailing boat, but they did not see any lights. They sounded the whistle once and ordered the rudder to starboard, etc. The arbitrators also questioned the boatman of the Jinliwan sailing boat for about an hour. After the investigation, it is necessary to search for factual evidence and investigate the Chengdu ship anchored at the location in order to clarify the truth. A further interrogation must be held next time.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Changes Commercial Registration and Registration Procedures</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Has Ordered All Industries to Comply with the Operating Permits</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for merchants in various places to understand the company registration matters and commercial registration procedures, the Ministry of Industry recently revised the various registration application forms and created new registration application forms for changes, transfers, and appointment of managers. The two types of registration application forms for commercial establishment registration and manager appointment registration, which were priced at one yuan each, have also been abolished due to inconvenient procedures. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city announced that it would stop charging fees from yesterday and issued orders to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations. The following is an excerpt from the order: The original order to stop charging fees for the two types of registration application forms for commercial establishment registration and manager appointment registration stated: In the past, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered the production of two types of registration application forms for commercial establishment registration and manager appointment registration, which were distributed to various provinces, cities, and bureaus for sale to merchants, and a fee of one yuan per copy was charged, with 70% remitted to the Ministry and 30% retained for registration expenses. However, since the issuance, the commercial registration cases handled by registration offices in various places have often been delayed due to the application and reporting of sales numbers, and merchants applying for registration must first purchase the application forms before they can fill them out for registration, which is inconvenient in terms of procedure. In order to facilitate merchants and save procedures, the two types of registration application forms for commercial establishment registration and manager appointment registration are abolished. In the future, merchants applying for commercial registration will no longer need to purchase application forms in addition to the registration fee. The application forms previously sold by the Bureau will be discontinued from today, and it is hoped that this will be announced to the public. The original order on improving company registration matters stated: It has been found that merchants in various places often lack clarity on the company registration application procedures, and there are many omissions and errors in the reported registration items and documents. Although the competent authorities review and approve them, it takes time to send them back and forth. It is planned to formulate various types of registration application forms, a shareholder register form, in a total of six types, so that merchants can imitate and fill them out according to the forms, and continue to add and slightly revise the resolutions of the company's founding meeting, the investigation report, the operating budget, and the director's and supervisor's forms, with added notes and explanations, in order to make it easier for merchants to understand and facilitate them.</p>
<h3>Iranian Consul General in Shanghai, Osdo Movin, Scheduled to Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>After taking office, the Consul General of Iran in Shanghai, Mr. Osdo Movin, recently visited Mr. Zhou Jue, the Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, to make an official call. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Director Zhou returned the visit. Mr. Osdo heard that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhang Qun, was scheduled to meet with him in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 24th, so he has scheduled to take the Shanghai-Nanjing train at 4:00 PM on the 23rd to go to Nanjing, and is scheduled to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng this morning at the City Hall.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Inspection Meeting Concludes</h3>
<p>Representatives Visit Beiqing Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>The Technical Committee on Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry held a wheat flour inspection meeting in Shanghai. Attendees included representatives from the four bureaus of Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, and Shanghai. The meeting began on the 16th and was held for three consecutive days, and has now concluded. The representatives of the Research Bureau visited the Harbor Serum Manufacturing Plant yesterday afternoon. After the event, they will return to their bureaus to take charge of their duties within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Regular Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Loan Association</h3>
<p>Approved 43 Small Credit Loans, Totaling 22,750 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its 25th meeting at the Bank of China Goods at 4:30 PM on the 18th. The attending committee members were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Song Ziliang, Yu Zuoting, (Qin acting) Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, (Bei acting) Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, (Wang acting). Chairman Cai Zengji reported on routine affairs, and then submitted 48 applications for small credit loans. After review, it was decided to approve two applications, approve five applications with half the originally requested amount, and approve 36 applications with a reduced amount, totaling 22,750 yuan. The loan was rejected for five other households because their operations did not conform to the loan principles or the intended use of the loan did not comply with the regulations. It was resolved that all previous resolutions regarding factory numbers that falsely reported capital to apply for loans, and those whose application amounts exceeded half of their capital in violation of the principles set by the Ministry, or cases of non-compliance with the application procedures, would still be rejected after investigation. Therefore, it is hoped that the general factory numbers applying for loans must pay close attention and inquire in detail at the office of the association when obtaining the forms, so as not to repeat the previous mistakes, resulting in rejection and complicated procedures.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Trade Association Prepares to Convene a Meeting of Directors</h3>
<p>Both Sides Report on Association Affairs to Each Other</p>
<p>The General Association of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association has found a location on the fourth floor of the Jin Cheng Bank Building on Jiangxi Road as its association headquarters and is now actively arranging it. After the President of the Association, Zhou Zuomin, arrived in Shanghai on the China National Aviation plane on the 17th, he will convene a meeting of directors for this month. It is heard that the Japanese Director of the Association, Mr. Funatsu, returned to Japan some time ago due to business matters. The Association requested him to report the situation of the Association here to the Japanese General Association, and to request that the situation of the Association there also be reported here, so as to jointly proceed. According to the organization charter of the Association, the presidents of the two General Associations are designated as the ex officio vice presidents of the other General Association. Mr. Ogi, the President of the Japan-China Trade Association, has entrusted Representative Funatsu to facilitate close contact, and it is not yet decided whether Mr. Zhou Zuomin, the President of our General Association, will entrust a representative.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Re-Levies Business Tax on Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association Cables Ministry of Finance to Stop It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association recently received letters from the Dawa Cigarette Company in Chongqing, Sichuan, and other companies, stating that Sichuan Province has been ordered to start levying a business tax, starting in Chongqing, and establishing a business tax bureau to carry out the pilot project. For the cigarette business, it is also required that business operators be notified to fill out a form reporting the total amount of business income, which will be subject to a business tax of 6/1000, which is close to double taxation and violates the regulations for the collection of business tax and the approval No. 14174 given by the Ministry of Finance in December of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) to the Shanghai Tobacco Trade Association. They specially requested the Association to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to transfer the order to stop the double taxation, so as to avoid additional burdens. The Association believes that since the cigarettes leaving the factory already pay a unified tax, and the sales also pay a license tax, the burden is already heavier than other businesses, and the business tax should be exempted. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and a letter to the Taxation Department, requesting that they quickly approve a telegram to stop the double taxation, and recorded the following telegram: To Minister Shao Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, it is reported that the Dawa Cigarette Company in Qing and other companies have written to say that Sichuan Province has ordered the opening of a business tax, and the establishment of a pilot project in Chongqing. Instructed tobacco merchants to fill out a form reporting the total amount of business income, which must be levied at 6/1000, which violates the business tax collection regulations and the Ministry's approval for the exemption of business tax on cigarettes. Please transfer the request to telegraph to stop the double levy, etc., to the Association. The association has learned that when cigarettes leave the factory, they already pay a unified tax, and when they are sold, they pay a license tax. Their tax burden is greater than that of other businesses. Therefore, the regulations for the collection of business tax stipulate that cigarettes are not included in the collection. The various provincial business tax bureaus also follow the regulations. The Ministry’s approval No. 14174 was granted to the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association in December of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) and exempted the license tax on cigarettes from business tax. The explanation is very detailed, and it is clear that the business tax should not be levied again. Today, the Sichuan Bureau is disregarding the instructions and is planning to levy the tax according to the discussion, which is very inappropriate. I dare to express the facts and ask you to quickly approve the telegram to stop the heavy levy, so as to avoid the additional burden on tobacco merchants. Please wait for orders from the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association.</p>

<h3>National Government Relief Committee: Cheng Jingsheng Discusses Spring Relief in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Over One Million Relief Funds Needed, Initial Allocation of 490,000, Inspectors Assigned to Review on March 20th</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng, the newly appointed member of the National Government Relief Committee, was originally a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Relief Association and Director of Disaster Relief. Recently, he came to Shanghai to assist with the Shanghai Material Relief Association. According to his discussion of the spring relief situation in Jiangsu Province, the disaster situation in various counties of Jiangsu Province is too severe, and relief cannot be carried out without more than one million relief funds. Fundraising is not easy, so it has now been decided to raise funds on the one hand, and pre-allocate and review the available funds on the other, in the hope of not delaying the agricultural relief period. Qiao Baoyuan, Wang Xiaobai, Chou Zhu, Zhu Qiliu, Du Yunshi, Zhang Zhongkuan, Zhu Bofu, Zhao Shouzheng, and others have been assigned as inspectors for Tongshan and other counties. The total amount of inspection and release is 440,000 yuan, and the total amount of agricultural relief is 50,000 yuan, totaling 490,000 yuan (all to be reviewed and released starting on March 20th). The relief funds allocated to each county are listed below: Pizhou 140,000 yuan, Peixian 85,000 yuan, Tongshan 62,000 yuan, Suqian 40,000 yuan, Shuyang 40,000 yuan, Donghai 24,000 yuan, Fengxian 20,000 yuan, Su Yun 12,000 yuan, Siyang 10,000 yuan, Lianshui 5,000 yuan, and an additional 2,000 yuan to be allocated to Suining for relief. In addition, 40,000 yuan for agricultural relief in the Tongshan area, 5,000 yuan for agricultural relief in the Donghai area, and 5,000 yuan for agricultural relief in the Huaiyin area.</p>
<h3>Humanitarian Foreign Relief Association: Report on the Recent Disaster Situation in Shandong</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Chinese and Foreign Relief Association recently held a meeting and decided on the Shandong Spring Relief Measures, which were reported previously. Mr. Lu Bohong, Director of the Association, received a report from Xu Xingchu, Director of the First Hospital in the Jining Disaster Area, which is recorded as follows: On the 5th of this month, Shandong, due to lack of funds, issued a notice ordering all county shelters to be closed by the 15th of this month, and disaster victims to be sent back to their original homes. Upon hearing this order, the disaster victims cried bitterly, because returning home would not only mean no food, but also no shelter. It is impossible to find even a dry piece of land to sleep on, let alone anything else. This is because the water in the disaster area has not only not receded, but has also increased. Taking Jining County as an example, the Yellow River once dried up last year, but the flooded land is still not habitable. There are still thousands of disaster victims living in caves on the levees surrounded by water. There is no hope for wheat, and autumn planting is even more impossible. The disaster victims who were previously sent back have no food or shelter, and can truly be described as starving corpses everywhere. The people are emaciated, and the government only offers cheap grain, but the disaster victims have no money to buy it and there is no charitable relief. A few days ago, the Yellow River rose again by more than a foot. A disaster like this has no parallel. The future of the disaster victims is even more unimaginable. Now beggars are everywhere in Jining County, wandering everywhere, unable to find grass roots or tree bark to satisfy their hunger. Their bitter suffering is unbearable to witness. However, the disaster victims who have returned to the county have no way to make a living. Those who have not returned are still being sent back one after another. Now, facing tens of thousands of disaster victims, there is neither a room to shelter them nor chaff to fill their stomachs. If more than 100,000 people are completely sent back, how will they be accommodated? The above only refers to Jining County. There are many other places that are even worse. The other day, it was learned that about 30,000 disaster victims have returned to Dongping County this time. Because the original village houses of the disaster victims are still in the water and cannot be returned to, they all rest in the county seat. There is no space on the streets, especially around the county government. They are all asking the county magistrate for resettlement and maintenance of livelihood. However, a county seat, especially Dongping County after a major disaster, suddenly has more than 30,000 hungry people. Even if all the resources of the entire county seat are exhausted, it will be difficult to feed them for even a day. Therefore, the disaster victims cry day and night, asking the county magistrate to find a solution, but what solution can the county magistrate come up with? The poor county magistrate cried to the disaster victims, and the disaster victims also cried. As a result, the county magistrate led the disaster victims to ask the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the Commissioner's Office to find a solution. This is the recent situation in Dongping. It is also heard from official sources that disaster victims returning to several counties in Jining are looting food due to lack of food. They are unarmed and do not carry weapons, only rob food. They do not take gold, silver, or other objects, nor do they hurt people. They do not fight back when beaten or scolded. They only ask to be full. Therefore, the officials have no way to punish them. Although the local chaos is like this, it is also fortunate because the local customs in the disaster area are fierce, and anger does not last long. In such a major disaster area, there are no bandits. This has to praise the official's proper handling. However, if there are no perfect relief measures in the future, it is feared that they will be tempted by others, and the disaster victims will take risks, which will be very harmful to the local area and the country. This is an important point that must be paid attention to. I implore the philanthropists in Shanghai to generously donate to jointly provide humanitarian aid, which can not only save tens of thousands of lives, but also eliminate national hidden dangers invisibly. For humanity and for the country, we cannot sit idly by and ignore it.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company: Workers Petitioned the Party and Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dismissed Workers Demand Assistance</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The Japanese-owned transportation barge company at No. 10 Hankou Road in this city has a total of 44 barges, specializing in loading and unloading goods shipped to the port by the Japanese. Part of the sentenced workers is contracted by Li Rongji in Pudong, who employs hundreds of foremen and workers. Recently, on the 16th of this month, twelve foremen were dismissed and all the workers on ten barges were frightened. Yesterday, Chai Ayou, director of the Tugboat Workers' Union, together with worker representatives Chen Zhaokui, Chen Zhen, and others, petitioned the party and government organs and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, requesting assistance to maintain their livelihoods. Zhu Gui Mao of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau met with them and promised to investigate the truth and then mediate. Dai Youheng of the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department and Shao Xuyou, a member of the Standing Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions, met with them and expressed their willingness to provide full assistance. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3>New Invention by China Decal Company</h3>
<p>Aimed at Promoting National Products and Recovering Rights</p>
<p>The China Decal Printing Co., Ltd. on An Nanjing Road in this city, since it produced decal paper for use on porcelain and woodware hardware, and trademark decals last year, its products have been excellent and are the crown of the country. Merchants in Shanghai who used to rely on foreign countries for orders now mostly order from the company. There is a lot of work to be done. It is truly the dawn of the national goods industry. It is reported that the company is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting this Sunday to discuss expanding its business and re-elect directors.</p>
<h3>Charity Art Fair: Night Closure Slightly Delayed</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the工部局, recently, due to the suggestion of the Security Committee, when charity art fairs are held in public game places, the night closing time can be extended from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM. However, the extension of the time of each art fair must be determined by the Chief Executive of the 工部局 and the Chief of the Police Department depending on the nature of the gatherings. Recently, the 工部局 has received requests from various charities and other societies to slightly change the provisions of the 工部局's Announcement No. 3926 of February 21, 1930, which stipulates that the business hours of game places shall not exceed 2:00 AM. This matter has been discussed by the authorities of the Public Concession and it is intended to take a unified approach with the French authorities, but no agreement has been reached so far. Recently, the Board of Directors again sought the opinion of the Security Committee. As a result, the Committee advocated that the extension of the opening hours of charity gatherings could be handled by the Chief Executive in consultation with the Chief of the Police Department, as appropriate. This proposal was then approved.</p>
<h3>Jingwu Association Travel Department: Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association in this city has always had a photography research club. Every week on holidays, they travel to various places to take scenery, develop and print their own photos, and publicly review them to learn from each other. Photographers in Shanghai, such as Cheng Zipei, Na Xiqi, Jian Shikeng, and Zuo Gengsheng, have once served as voluntary instructors. The association has a large-scale darkroom that can accommodate more than a dozen people working at the same time, and has an enlarger for students to conduct in-depth research. In recent years, quite a few members have become proficient in this field, but the required materials are mostly imported. In recent years, the price of foreign goods has soared, more than doubling compared to the past, limited by the economy, so the number of participants has decreased day by day. After the January 28th Incident, it gradually dispersed invisibly. Now, the Travel Department of the Association is holding a photography exhibition to promote the art of photography and arouse the interest of photography travelers. Since the announcement of the solicitation of photos was published, more than 200 excellent photos have been received one after another, full of beautiful things and too beautiful to be seen all at once. These works are a collection of famous ancient sites visited in various places. The most notable is the scenery along the Hangzhou-Wenzhou Highway, such as the magnificence of Fangyan Wangfeng, the excellence of Xiandu Dinghu, the majesty of Yandang Mountain, and the mystery of Tiantai, as well as the greatness of the highway project and the magnificence of the bridges, all of which make the viewers feel like they are in the scene. It is now scheduled to hold an exhibition for one week starting from the 22nd of this month on the third floor of the Special District Branch of the Association in the Daxia Department Store on Nanjing Road. The hours are from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day. Admission is free and all circles are welcome to visit. It is thought that those who generally love to take care of their health will be happy to go there first.</p>

<h3>Turmoil from Price Reduction at Two Silk and Satin Shops on Nanjing Road: Goods Damaged, Show Window Glass Smashed, Police Arrived to Suppress the Situation Before Order Was Restored</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Lao Jiu He Silk and Satin Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Dalu Department Store and Wangping Street usually does good business. Yesterday morning, they put up a moralistic sign: "Down with False and Arrogant Propaganda," using 100 bolts of genuine silk spinning satin, selling at a uniform price of one cent per foot as a gimmick. At the same time, the Da Sheng Fu Silk and Satin Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road also advertised, using 100 bolts of genuine silk spinning satin, selling two feet for one cent, various kinds of silk selling two feet for one cent, and new-style ge cloth selling five feet for one cent as a gimmick, competing with each other, causing buyers to flock to them.</p>
<p>Crowded Customers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, in front of the two silk and satin shops, more and more customers buying cheap goods gathered, no less than several thousand people. The traffic on Nanjing Road was blocked. At 9:00 AM, after opening the doors, everyone poured in, and the scene was full of noise and chaos. The two shops had no room to insert their feet. Those who arrived later still crowded forward, causing the women to be squeezed to the point where water could not flow through, their voices hoarse and exhausted, and some even shouted for help. The items displayed in the store were all knocked to the ground, in a mess, and trampled on. The glass show windows were also smashed. At this time, the staff of the two shops could not stop it and had to frantically blow whistles for rescue.</p>
<p>Police Suppression</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the police station in charge immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to disperse the crowd and arrest several people. They then closed the iron gate tightly. At about 10:00 AM, the situation returned to normal. Lao Jiu He specially posted a temporary notice saying: "Our shop is sorting out the goods and will be temporarily closed for three hours. Business will resume as usual at 1:00 PM in the afternoon." Da Sheng Fu also posted a similar notice. The two shops suffered considerable losses of goods and show window glass. Some people were injured in the crush and automatically went to the hospital. All have been released.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Rectifies Long-Distance Telephone Connections, and Stipulates that the Disconnection of Long-Distance Telephones Should Be the Responsibility of the Operator at the Calling Station</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications instructed the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, saying: "Long-distance telephones were originally established to facilitate communication. However, according to reports, it often takes four or five hours to connect even an ordinary call. No matter how congested the lines are, it should not be so slow. You should immediately strictly order all subordinate bureaus to pay attention to rectification to facilitate communication. Moreover, the continued extension of long-distance calls to three sessions has long been stipulated and implemented. However, according to repeated reports, long-distance operators are negligent in calculating call time and often do not ask the callers whether they want to continue the call before disconnecting and stopping the call, which is very inappropriate. In the future, you must follow the regulations and inquire with the caller before disconnecting. Even if there is an urgent military call that requires stopping an already connected call, you should also explain the situation to the caller to avoid misunderstandings. The calculation of call time and disconnection work should be the responsibility of the operator at the calling station to ensure accountability. After this circular is issued, the relevant supervisors should be responsible for strict supervision. If any arbitrary disconnection or other incidents occur again, once verified, they will be severely punished to warn others to follow suit. You should comply with and transmit this to all subordinates for unified compliance." This order.</p>

<h3>Old Father Confesses That His Son Committed Arson Out of Spite: Fire at Tai He Tang Chinese Medicine Store, Police Arrested Liu Jianrong for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Tai He Tang Chinese Medicine Store at No. 982 Route Pichon in the French Concession was founded by Liu Yichang (53 years old) from Nanjing. It has been more than 40 years since then, and the business is still developing. At 8:55 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the stove room of the store and immediately spread. Fire brigades from all roads in the French Concession heard the alarm and drove to the rescue. The fire was extinguished at 10:10 PM. In this battle, the entire store was destroyed and the loss was extremely heavy. Unexpectedly, when the police sent someone to investigate the cause of the fire afterwards, the store owner Liu Yichang openly stated that his son Liu Jianrong had always been idle, squandered money, and this time because he did not get the money, he committed arson to vent his anger. The police believed that Liu's confession was straightforward and credible. They are now stepping up their efforts to arrest his son Jianrong and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Counterfeit Money for 300 Yuan: Upon Opening, All Were Waste Paper: A Big Argument Erupted in a Teahouse: Three People Involved Were Arrested</h3>
<p>At 7:15 PM the night before last, the Tongfangju Teahouse across from the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road suddenly became noisy and sirens wailed. Chinese Constable No. 1068 went upstairs to investigate and saw several people twisted into a group and beating each other non-stop. He then began to arrest them. In total, three people were arrested: Zhou Defang from Nanjing, Yan Liangeng from Changzhou, and Wang Xiangsheng from Ningbo, along with a paper package, one paper each of counterfeit Central Bank 5-jiao and 2.5-jiao coins, and brought to the Huisi Police Station. After interrogating them, the Chinese and Western detectives learned that Yan and Wang confessed that they had been introduced by Sang Dianzhu, who said that Zhou Defang had a large number of Central Bank counterfeit jiao tickets for sale. They then bought them from Zhou, planning to take them back to their hometown for mixed use. At that time, it was stated that the selling price of each 100 yuan of counterfeit money was 30 yuan, so they handed Zhou 90 yuan. At the same time, Zhou handed over a paper package, saying that there were 300 yuan of counterfeit money inside. However, this place is a public place with many eyes and ears, so it cannot be opened. However, Yan and Wang did not listen and opened the package, and the top and bottom sides were indeed each one paper of counterfeit money, but the middle was all waste paper. They believed that Zhou should not have defrauded them of money, which led to an argument, followed by violence, which is why they were arrested. The police chief ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above situation and said that the police still need to investigate the inside story of the case, so he requested that Zhou and the other three be detained. When interrogating Yan and Wang, the suddenly changed their confession, saying that yesterday on Tiantong Road, they suddenly saw a person hastily leaving a paper package on the ground, which was picked up by someone who claimed to be named Sang Dianzhu. Sang then discussed with them, saying that there was 300 yuan of legal currency in the package, which the three of them could share. He slightly opened the paper package to show that it was genuine. The two of them were temporarily blinded by greed and handed over the 90 yuan they had received to Sang, who also handed the paper package to them. When they opened it, they saw that it was waste paper, so they grabbed Sang and went to the Tongfangju Teahouse to reason with him, which led to an argument. Sang took the opportunity to escape, and Zhou was mistakenly arrested. Judge Wu Zehan verified the confession and ordered Zhou, Yan, and Wang to be detained for seven days for investigation and further interrogation.</p>

<p>Robbers Tang Jinsheng, 32 years old, from Suzhou, and Li Jinsheng, 30 years old, from Zhenjiang, colluded with others to rob Wang Ronghua's house at No. 632 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession the night before last and escaped with the stolen goods. Tang and Li each carried two large packages of stolen goods and hired rickshaws. When they passed the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Li Mei Road, they were spotted by Chinese Constable No. 661 of the French Concession, who suspected them and questioned them. They were evasive and were taken to the police station. After interrogation by the police chief, they confessed that they had robbed the above-mentioned location and also confessed that their accomplices, including Chen Xiaopin, were gathering at the Xinyuan Bathhouse on Xin Zha Road. After getting the confession, the police chief ordered Inspector Jiang Futian, Detectives Wang Rusong and Zhang Daorong, Detectives Bao Tan, Shen Jinshu, Weng Huanzhang and Yang Zhongfang to go to the British Police Station and together go to the Xinyuan Bathhouse to arrest Chen Xiaopin (31 years old, from Tongzhou) and Zhu Rongfu (38 years old, from Suzhou).

<h3>Tracking Down and Killing Two Robbers on the Road, Then Catching the Escaped Robber; The Dead Robbers Were Inspected and Coffined Yesterday</h3>
<p>The robbers, Zhou Da A-Jin (age 20) from Zao Ning, Zhao Feng-Zheng (age 30), Sun Jin-Biao, Hu Rong-Cai, and others, wielding weapons, robbed residents of their property near Meizhou Road, Hejian Road, Yangshupu, around 7 AM the day before yesterday.

After a while, they saw A-Jin, Zhao Feng-Zheng, and Zhou Da stumbling towards them, pushing at the door of a single-story house, unable to enter, and planning to find another way in. The detectives rushed forward to capture them, but Zhou Da opened fire to resist. The A-Jin and Zhao robbers also made motions to draw their guns, so the Chinese and Western detectives drew their guns and returned fire. As a result, A-Jin and Zhao Feng-Zheng were hit in vital areas and fell into a small ditch there. Zhou Da took the opportunity to escape, while the Sun and Hu robbers, hearing the gunshots, did not dare to advance and hid near a dilapidated house nearby. They were later arrested. The two robbers who fell into the ditch were taken to the General Hospital of the Public Works Department but died after treatment was ineffective. After the bodies were taken to the coroner's office on Faelen Road, it was discovered that Zhou Da lived at his brother's place at a certain address on Beile Road in the French Concession. The detectives immediately took the Sun and Hu robbers to the French Concession, joined the officers from the jurisdiction's police station, and apprehended the Zhou robber nearby. No firearms were found during the search of Zhou. The detectives took the Zhou, Sun, and Hu robbers back to the police station, where they were separately detained. Two fake pistols were found near the thatched house at the robbery site, and another identical pistol was found on the dead robber A-Jin. Yesterday morning, Sun Jin-Biao and four other men and women were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shi-Zhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, described the case in detail and requested detention for investigation. Following this, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the process of solving the case and presented the fake pistols for inspection. When questioned, the defendants stammered in their testimony. Judge Xiao Xie-Fen ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date. The two dead robbers were examined by Prosecutor Zhang Zong-Ru, who was dispatched by the court to the scene, and he declared that the dead robbers A-Jin and Zhao Feng-Zheng had indeed died from gunshot wounds sustained before death. Since no family members were found, the bodies were handed over to the Pushan Burial Society for coffining. The clothes and hats left behind were allowed to be placed in the coffins with the bodies.</p>

One grabbed clothing worth over one hundred yuan and attempted to escape. Subsequently, a robber holding a gun was recognized by the victim, who secretly followed behind and reported to the Chinese police on guard duty at the boundary road. As a result, the robber was accidentally wounded in the leg by a stray bullet. After investigation by Zhang De-Sheng and other detectives from the Huisi Police Station, the two injured men were sent to the patrol police hospital. The body was taken to the coroner's office on Faelen Road. The police station found that the robber had also been detained by the Yangshupu Police Station for a robbery case in May of the previous year and sentenced to seven years in prison by the court. He had only been released from prison on February 1 of this year. The gun seized from the robber contained eight bullets. After the body was inspected, Western Police Chief Bo Wu reported the previous circumstances.

<h3>Female Actress Tan Lian-Fen Struggles for Love, Publishes a Notice to Dissolve Her Relationship with Her Foster Mother, and Sues in Court for Restriction of Freedom</h3>
<p>After Kunqu actress Ding Wan-E divorced Ding Shao-Lan, she cohabited with Yang Bing-Hua, a ticket seller at the theater, at No. 4, Dashun Lane, Xizang Road. Shao-Lan had previously bought a young girl, Tan Lian-Fen, and taught her Shenqu opera. Lian-Fen was later taken away by Wan-E to continue studying opera. Now, Miss Tan is 21 years old and freely fell in love with Zhao Chun-Fang, who works in the same industry, last year. Ding and Yang, fearing that this "cash cow" would be snatched away by Zhao, restricted their interactions. However, Zhao and Tan could not restrain their feelings and often took advantage of opportunities for secret meetings. On the twenty-second day of the lunar first month, Miss Tan suddenly disappeared. Ding and Yang suspected that Zhao had enticed her away and forced him to hand her over. Later, they severely beat the girl and forced Zhao to write a letter of regret, vowing not to associate with the girl anymore. However, the girl still ran away to her brother's place a week later and published a notice in the newspaper to dissolve her relationship with Ding Wan-E. At the same time, she hired a lawyer to sue Wan-E and Yang Bing-Hua in the First Special District Court for restriction of freedom. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang summoned them for questioning. Tan Lian-Fen recounted the details of being repeatedly beaten and humiliated by Ding and Yang and presented a medical certificate issued by a doctor. The defendants also presented evidence, claiming that they were the plaintiff's mother and had spent forty yuan to sell the plaintiff two years ago. They denied mistreating the girl, and claimed that the letter of regret was written voluntarily by Zhao. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning after summoning witnesses.</p>

<p>Public Concession Public Works Department; An Overview of This Year's Financial Budget</p>
<p>Recurrent Revenue 24,780,000, Recurrent Expenditure 26,730,000, The Balance Between Revenue and Expenditure Still Lacks 1,950,000, Extraordinary Revenue 13,280,000, This Year's Major Construction 3,220,000, A Decrease of More Than 1,130,000 Compared to Last Year, Repeated Attempts to Reduce Government Spending Amounted to Savings of More Than 340,000 Yuan, After Allocating the Reserve Fund, More Than 40,000 Yuan May Remain, Within Which Public Bonds of 12,000,000 Yuan Must Be Held, The Balance Between Extraordinary Revenue and Expenditure Leaves Only More Than 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, the Finance Committee of the Public Works Department convened a meeting to discuss this year's budget matters. At that time, the Director of Finance made a brief report on the main points of this year's budget proposal. He stated that this year's recurrent revenue reached 24,451,200 yuan. In addition, there was a surplus of 269,740 yuan carried over from last year's general financial report, which was not included. Therefore, the total estimated revenue for this year could reach 24,781,740 yuan, a decrease of 1,132,110 yuan compared to the same budget amount last year. The reason for this shortfall was the expected sluggishness of various income items, such as a shortfall of 988,000 yuan in general taxes, 82,100 yuan in special taxes, 189,450 yuan in license fees, and 123,640 yuan in public and municipal enterprise income.</p>
<p>As for the recurrent expenditure items, the total amount of expenses for various departments and agencies under the ordinary budget this year was 24,439,760 yuan, and the education budget, excluding the 41,130 yuan carried over from last year, still required 2,338,740 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of recurrent expenses needed was 26,736,100 yuan, a decrease of 341,940 yuan compared to the same recurrent expenses last year. All expenses, wherever savings could be made, within the scope of maintaining efficiency and urgent services, had been reduced as much as possible. Therefore, the reduction in this year's budgeted expenditure was also the result of strict austerity measures.</p>
<p>The balance between the above-mentioned recurrent revenue and expenditure still showed a shortage of 1,954,360 yuan. After allocating a reserve fund of 2,000,000 yuan, there was still a surplus of 45,640 yuan, which could be used for unexpected needs (however, this figure did not include the newly added education subsidy of a total of 30,000 yuan, which was recently approved by the board of directors on the 18th of this month).</p>
<p>Under the extraordinary revenue item, this year's budget was only 13,185,260 yuan, while last year it was 25,780,070 yuan. According to the plan set last year, the 1926 public bonds, which were due this year, would not be redeemed for the time being, and the sale of surplus land could yield 1,300,000 yuan. Miscellaneous income was estimated to be around 50,000 yuan. This year's allocation of extraordinary expenses for education totaled 64,740 yuan, a decrease of 95,360 yuan compared to last year. In addition, the amount to be raised through the issuance of public bonds or other temporary measures accounted for 12,000,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,500,000 yuan compared to the amount approved last year.</p>
<p>Under the extraordinary expenditure item, the total amount of major construction projects recommended by various committees to be included under the extraordinary budget this year was 3,219,500 yuan, of which 64,740 yuan was earmarked for education. In addition, there were allocations for the amortization funds for the 1925, 1922, and 1927 public bonds, as well as measures for recovery</p>
<p>As for the reason why the figures for ordinary expenses in this year's budget were so high, it was mostly because many senior personnel had reached retirement age. However, most of these expenses were one-time and would not be repeated.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, Showing Compassion for Uninformed Smokers, Held Supplementary Registration; The Matter Has Been Forwarded by the Municipal Government to the National Anti-Smoking Association for Approval</h3>
<p>The Da Gong She reported that after the Municipal Public Security Bureau closed the registration of smokers, all unlicensed smokers apprehended according to the law were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for military punishment. Unexpectedly, in the past few months, the number of people apprehended in various districts reached more than 800, causing the Garrison Headquarters to be unable to accommodate them. The bureau felt pity and, with the approval of Director Cai, the smoker registration section forwarded the matter to the Municipal Government to hold smoker registration as a form of relief. The registration procedures would still be handled according to the old rules. The matter has been forwarded by the Municipal Government to the National Anti-Smoking Association of the Military Commission for approval. According to Dai, the section chief, the issue of supplementary registration is expected to be approved by the Association, and it is likely to begin next month. As for before the registration begins, each district will still be ordered to strictly investigate.</p>
<h3>An Ox Was Bitten to Death by Rats</h3>
<p>Lu Gui-Sheng, a local residing at Gongjiazhai on the south side of Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, had an ox that he had been raising for three or four years.

<h3>The Women's Temperance Society Petitioned the Central Government to Cooperate in Rescuing Beggars</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Women's Temperance Society has spared no effort in advocating for the rescue of beggars. It has also established the Women and Children's Education and Welfare Institute in Jiangwan, providing care and education to beggar women and children. Its contributions to society have long been significant and have aroused the attention of people from all walks of life. It is heard that in order to further promote large-scale relief efforts, a proposal has been drafted and submitted to President Chiang, ordering governments at all levels to work with local charitable organizations to carry out the effort. The original text is as follows: A petition for the relief of beggars. It is observed that the consolidation of national defense and the clarification of internal affairs are prerequisites for the rejuvenation of the nation and the strength of the country, and that the issue of people's livelihood should be the top priority of internal affairs. If we can save our fellow compatriots who are in dire straits and suffering as beggars and elevate them to respectable positions, then at the very least, we can reduce the obstacles to maintaining public security and solve a part of the problem of people's livelihood. However, even in Shanghai, an economic and cultural center, beggars are rampant in the streets. The situation in other inland areas is self-evident. In recent years, due to the floods, there have been even more beggars. At a time when we are implementing the New Life Movement, if their livelihood cannot be resolved, what kind of morality and integrity can we talk about? The Society, aware of this, has been working hard to promote the beggar rescue movement and has established the Women and Children's Education and Welfare Institute in Jiangwan, Shanghai, to provide practical relief. Now, we specifically submit the following plan for rescuing beggars: 1. The Legislative Yuan should stipulate that anyone who lives by begging should be considered to be obstructing public safety. Those who have no home to return to after being released from prison should be sent to shelters. Adults should work, and child beggars should work and study part-time. 2. Governments at all levels should unite with local charities, commercial organizations, and other groups to establish farms, factories, and work-study schools to accommodate beggars. 3. A penalty should be imposed on those who sporadically give to beggars. Your Honor, looking to the central authorities, with a single call from the top, everyone near and far will support you. Seeing these difficulties, you must be extremely concerned. It is appropriate to submit this document for your review and implementation. It will be in the public interest.</p>

They also went to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia to raise capital, but the amounts were not yet sufficient, with each investor contributing about 10,000 yuan. It is still hoped that new and old shareholders will work hard to invest more or solicit investment on behalf of the company. Then, the proposals were discussed. 1. The resolution to amend Article 4 of the investment prospectus was amended to read: "If, within five years after the resumption of business, the annual profit is insufficient to pay the interest on preferred shares, the board of directors, representing the shareholders, shall devise a method to raise funds in the name of the company."

<h3>Deputy Commissioner of the Public Concession, Mr. Kevin Plans to Return Home on Schedule</h3>
<p>Mr. Kevin, Deputy Commissioner of the Special Affairs Section of the Police Department of the Public Concession, is retiring due to old age and will leave Shanghai on March 24 to return to his hometown of Ireland and enjoy his later years. Mr. Kevin was hired by the Public Works Department in 1907 and served as the head of the Criminal Section of the Jing'an Temple and West Hongkou police stations, solving numerous major cases. He was repeatedly commended and rewarded by the jury at the time. In 1917, Mr. Kevin was promoted to Chief of the Confidential Section of the General Investigation Office, which was later reorganized into a staff member of the Special Affairs Section, making his work even more difficult. Because of his diligence and repeated achievements, he was promoted to Assistant Commissioner in 1927 and received a long service medal. In 1934, he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner. In 1921, when the Communist Party was discovered in the city, Mr. Kevin demolished several important institutions on Dagu Road in the same year. In 1931, the Communist Party became more active, but thanks to Mr. Kevin's efforts, the important members of the Third International, the Noulens, were arrested and sent to Nanjing and sentenced to life imprisonment. Based on clues from this case, many Communist Party organizations were broken up at home and abroad. Based on the confessions of a certain criminal, sixteen bodies of people who had been killed by the Communist Party were recovered in the British and French concessions. Last year, he also captured Walter, a representative of the Third International, whose job was to collect Chinese military and political information, and was later sent to Hubei for punishment. The arrest of these Westerners benefited the Republic of China and its allies. Since 1931, a total of more than 700 reactionaries and political prisoners have been captured, and various types of military equipment have been seized. The National Government awarded him a first-class medal of the Navy, Army, and Air Force in 1934 for his meritorious service in assisting in the suppression of reactionaries in the concession. Recently, the Chinese authorities have submitted a request to the government to grant him a certificate of honor to commemorate his achievements. Mr. Kevin has been working in special affairs for a total of eighteen years. Whenever internal wars occur, labor unrest is serious, or riots are brewing, Mr. Kevin has always been able to make plans to prevent them from affecting the concession, so that the local authorities in the city can take precautions and the residents in the concession can live and work in peace. In addition, Mr. Kevin is also a member of the Film Censorship Committee and has set up a film censorship section in the Special Affairs Section to facilitate censorship. Moreover, whenever important Chinese and foreign figures come to Shanghai, Mr. Kevin is responsible for providing strict and confidential protection, so no accidents have ever occurred. Mr. Kevin occasionally enjoys riding and is good at socializing in his spare time. Because he is fluent in Chinese, French, and Russian, many foreign dignitaries in Shanghai are happy to associate with him. Mr. Kevin is an Irishman and is highly respected by his fellow countrymen in Shanghai. Mr. Kevin has also been the honorary secretary of the (St Patrick's Society) for twelve years, and all members have praised him. Even though Mr. Kevin is leaving, his contributions cannot be ignored.</p>

However, the smoking cessation rate of the newly invented Kang Le Fine, exceeds everything else. According to surveys, 9,743 people used Kang Le Fine to quit smoking last month. The factory received 4,861 letters of thanks and proof of rapid and safe smoking cessation from people in various places. Among them, thirteen letters stated that the quitters had smoked for 36 years. After using other medicines to no avail, they completely gave up their smoking habit in just one and a half months of using Kang Le Yolk Essence and Kang Le Fine. Their stomach capacity increased and their health improved. There were also letters of thanks and requests for more goods from overseas Chinese in the Americas, so overseas Chinese have also benefited from it. Recently, the factory has been unable to meet the demand and is working day and night to produce it. Service staff have been added to the guidance department to provide detailed guidance on safe smoking cessation methods. In Shanghai, you can go to the second floor of the Family Industry Agency at No. 307 Nanjing Road. Outside of Shanghai, you can send a letter to inquire and you will receive an immediate reply.</p>

He is of excellent character and learning, and has a great understanding and superior comprehension. He has certainly gained insights into national medical science and arts.

She had been treated by famous doctors repeatedly, but had not seen effective results. Later, Mr. Zou was invited to re-examine her.

<h3>The Fish Industry of Shanghai (3) Edited by Chinese WeChat (XVIII of the Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</h3>
<p>5.  The Shanghai Fish Market Established by the Ministry of Industry. From the previous section, we can see that the market price of fish changes very quickly, with large fluctuations, which is extremely unfavorable for both fishermen and citizens. At the same time, the dumping of foreign goods and the outflow of interests are also serious problems. The Ministry of Industry, recognizing this, began preparing for the Shanghai Fish Market in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) to achieve control and adjustment both domestically and internationally. However, due to funding issues, it was delayed for two years. Currently, it is largely completed, and it is expected to officially open in early April. Now, I will introduce its various situations:</p>
<p>The address of the Shanghai Fish Market is located north of the Dinghai Bridge at the end of Yangshupu Road, between the city center and the Public Concession, covering an area of more than 40 acres, with a coastline of 601 feet and five piers built. The buildings include a three-story office building, a three-story observation tower on top, an auction hall, dozens of brokerage offices, a cold storage and a water tower, all built with steel and concrete. The cold storage covers 1,788.88 cubic feet, with five cold storage rooms, an ice factory, and machine rooms and offices, with a cold storage capacity of 1,500 tons of fish. The capital of the fish market is set at one million yuan, of which 900,000 yuan will be spent on start-up costs, such as construction and equipment, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be used as working capital. The estimated annual profit will reach more than 200,000 yuan. Old-style fish shops will inevitably be affected once the fish market is realized. Therefore, they requested that they each contribute half of the million yuan as a joint official-commercial operation. Due to funding issues, the Ministry of Industry also agreed to the principle of joint operation. However, ice and fresh fish merchants generally opposed it, requesting that the Ministry of Industry maintain state-owned operation (on March 5th, the Ice and Fresh Fish Merchants' Public Welfare Society submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, elaborating on the reasons in detail. See the Shenbao of March 6th for details). This is an internal problem of the fish market and has nothing to do with the development of the market's future. (End)</p>

<h3>Central Department of Civic Training, Sports Division, Drafts "Implementation Plan for National Physical Education Guidance Work"</h3>
<p>In order to invigorate the national spirit and promote national physical education, the Central Government has established a Physical Education Guidance Division under the Central Department of Public Training. To facilitate advancement and guide Party headquarters at all levels nationwide, as well as national people's organizations, regarding national physical education training, a "Implementation Plan for National Physical Education Guidance Work" is specially formulated as a guiding principle. This plan has been approved and promulgated by the Central Government for implementation. Excerpts of the "Implementation Plan for National Physical Education Guidance Work" are as follows:</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>A sound mind resides in a sound body; hence, health is a fundamental condition for any undertaking. China's national power is declining, and it lags behind in everything. While the reasons for this are multifaceted, the weakening of the race and the flagging of the people's spirit are the primary causes. Therefore, promoting physical education, enabling the nation to develop physically, cultivating the virtues of unity and struggle, creating a moral atmosphere, forging a spirit of perseverance, hard work, and endurance, undertaking all endeavors, and enhancing the nation's self-defense capabilities are all of paramount importance at present. However, there is concern that complexities and lack of direction may lead to superficial implementation with little success. Recognizing this, the Central Government has established a Physical Education Guidance Division under the Department of Public Training to guide Party headquarters at all levels and national people's organizations in promoting and training national physical education, based on the principle of continuous self-improvement and the foundation of a strong nation and a strong race. The Implementation Plan for National Physical Education Training Guidance Work is hereby specified as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Guiding Principles</p>
<p>1. Enhance national consciousness, strengthen the body and mind, and increase self-defense capabilities to solidify the foundation of national defense.</p>
<p>2. Popularize public sports organizations and cultivate habits of organized and disciplined living.</p>
<p>3. Improve national health to increase people's productivity.</p>
<p>(2) Guiding Principles</p>
<p>1. Guidance shall be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Central Government resolutions, and the laws and regulations of the various departments and associations of the National Government.</p>
<p>2. Party headquarters at all levels should cooperate with local sports administrative agencies to promote sports and should supervise and guide sports organizations and other people's organizations.</p>
<p>3. Guide all counties and cities nationwide to establish sports associations and increase sports facilities to ensure that sports training is popularized among the people.</p>
<p>4. Promote the simplest and most economical sports and games so that they become household entertainment, encouraging people to participate in sports.</p>
<p>5. Effectively connect with relevant agencies and organizations for military training, national arts, and Boy Scout training to enhance the effectiveness of promotion.</p>
<p>(3) Guidance Agencies</p>
<p>1. Party headquarters at all levels should establish guidance personnel to promote national sports as follows: A. Provincial (municipal) Party headquarters or special Party headquarters should establish one sports officer within the Public Training Division (appointment procedures to be determined separately). B. County and city Party headquarters should appoint one sports officer or have the public training officer serve concurrently. 2. When necessary, Party headquarters at all levels may invite local sports experts or enthusiastic promoters of sports to organize local National Sports Design Committees to be responsible for designing and promoting national sports.</p>
<p>(4) Standards for Guiding Public Sports Work</p>
<p>1. Rural sports: The standard is to strengthen farmers' physique, develop a lively spirit and self-defense capabilities, correct bad habits harmful to the physical and mental health of farmers, instill basic hygiene knowledge, and enhance farmers' vitality.</p>
<p>2. Industrial and commercial sports: The standard is to strengthen physical fitness, improve inherent habits, regulate mental fatigue, and increase business efficiency.</p>
<p>3. Youth sports: The standard is to strengthen physical fitness, train self-defense skills, eliminate frivolous habits, and cultivate good character.</p>
<p>4. Women's sports: The standard is to strengthen physical fitness and cultivate a lively spirit.</p>
<p>5. Children's sports: The standard is to enable all parts of children's bodies to develop equally and to cultivate good character.</p>
<p>6. After-work sports: The standard is to assist public agencies in strengthening the physical fitness of civil servants, fostering the habit of using sports and games as entertainment, eliminating the habit of listlessness and perfunctory work, enriching their spirit, and increasing work efficiency.</p>
<p>(5) Implementation of Guiding Public Sports Work</p>
<p>1. Steps: Party headquarters at all levels should, based on this plan, carefully consider talent, economy, time, and location, comprehensively plan and formulate measures, and implement them decisively. After the aforementioned measures are determined, they should guide lower-level Party headquarters, people's organizations, and sports organizations to implement them. Higher-level agencies should send personnel to inspect and evaluate the sports situation and training work of lower-level Party headquarters and people's sports organizations, and reward or punish them accordingly.</p>
<p>2. Economy and Equipment: In accordance with national sports laws and regulations, regarding sports fields, children's playgrounds, and other facilities within the scope of public sports, governments should be urged to complete them in phases. Utilize the opening hours of school sports fields for the sports activities of various groups. Party headquarters at all levels should include sports funding in their budgets for regular business expenses for the purpose of promoting sports, the amount not exceeding 30% of the business expenses in principle. If local Party headquarters deem it necessary to subsidize the expenses of local people's organizations in promoting sports, they may provide appropriate subsidies based on their financial situation.</p>
<p>3. Key Points for Guiding Sports Activities: Party headquarters at all levels should utilize organized public groups, such as farmers' associations, labor unions, chambers of commerce, industrial and commercial guilds, student self-government associations, women's associations, education associations, and other special social organizations, to organize amateur sports associations to promote sports. The procedures for establishing sports organizations should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the revised People's Organization Act. Guide the public to organize various sports research associations, lectures, or invite famous athletes from various places to perform for observation, so as to enlighten public sports knowledge and increase public interest in engaging in sports. The implementation of sports training should take advantage of the rest time of the people of all industries, and consider the situation of human resources, financial resources, time and place, and choose the important and suitable ones to be held. Take advantage of folk sports meets and commemorative days or festivals to hold grand sports competitions to excite the listless masses. Formulate physical examination forms, distribute them to the public for physical examinations on a regular basis, and reward the best ones. Guide groups with funds and the meeting halls of fellow villagers to add sports facilities.</p>
<p>This plan shall be submitted by the Central Department of Public Training to the Central Standing Committee for record, and then promulgated for implementation.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Basketball Tournament Opens Yesterday: Fudan and Jinan Win Big: Fudan Defeats Guanghua 73 to 29; Jinan Defeats Chihchih 49 to 22</h3>
<p>The annual Jiangnan University men's and women's basketball tournament opened yesterday at Fudan and Chihchih schools. According to the original schedule, the women's competition was scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM. However, due to the difficulty of forming teams with female athletes from various schools, this year's Jiangnan University women's basketball tournament was declared dissolved in an invisible form. The men's competition began at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. As a result, Fudan defeated Guanghua 73 to 29, and Jinan defeated Chihchih 49 to 22. The second round of matches will be held tomorrow (21st), with the schedule being Fudan at Chihchih and Jinan at Guanghua.</p>
<p>Fudan Defeats Guanghua</p>
<p>Unequal Strength: The Guanghua-Fudan match opened at Fudan. With unequal strength between the two teams, Fudan's victory was naturally expected. In the first half, Guanghua was still able to cope, and the score was still close. After the break, Guanghua's morale was greatly demoralized, repeatedly giving Fudan offensive opportunities. The forwards and guards were neither good at defense nor had offensive skills, and their luck was not good. They had no chance of exploring the basket. Only Zhang Jiamei and Pan Weichun scored two consecutive goals in the last minute, adding a little embellishment. As for Fudan's lineup, it was very average, and the connection was also excellent. Chen Zongqi had many wonderful performances in the first half. Zhou Daiyun was like Rhine, the pirate in yesterday's game. He was tall and had many tricks. He scored 25 points alone, which was commendable. Although Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao was also lovely, he could not support the situation alone and could not save the day.</p>
<p>Fudan Wins Big: This game was originally scheduled to be held outdoors. At the request of Guanghua, it was changed to a confrontation in the gymnasium. When referee Zhang Peter blew his silver whistle, Fudan's Zhou and Chen generals failed to score in three shots. Guanghua's Pan Weichun jumped in and scored first, opening the record. Zhou Dayun made one penalty and one throw, and then Weng Ren'an explored the basket, and Fudan took the lead with five to two. After that, the situation became very dull. Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao scored a long shot, and Fudan added five points in a row. After that, Guanghua's Pan Weihao, Dong Shuzhao, and Zhou Hongyi made contributions, but Fudan's Zhou Dayun, Chen Zongqi, Weng Ren'an, and Qiu Guangxie did not give in. The score rose like a whirlwind, from ten to six to eighteen to nine, and ended the first half with twenty-five to thirteen in a blink of an eye. In the sound of the rematch, Fudan approached step by step, and Qiu Chuanzhou and others made great achievements. Guanghua was still able to cope at the beginning, and Yu Shouren, Pan Weichun, Dong Shuzhao, etc. also had no empty shots. Back and forth, the score was still close, but from forty-five to twenty-five, Guanghua panicked, and Fudan's Chuan Weng, Li Zheng, and Zhou generals were handy and hit every shot, and the score suddenly increased by as much as twenty-seven points. At this time, Guanghua only scored one goal by Dong Shuzhao, and the score had become seventy-two to twenty-five. In the last few minutes, both sides repeatedly replaced players. Guanghua's Zhang Jiamei and Pan Weizan each scored a goal, and Fudan's Zheng Boyi also scored one point from a penalty. After a fierce battle, the game ended with seventy-three to twenty-nine, and Fudan won big.</p>

<p>Jinan Defeats Chihchih: Jinan Takes the Lead; Jinan vs. Chihchih at Chihchih at 3:30 PM. Chihchih took the offensive first, circled several times, Chen Yunwan rushed out of the chaotic army, turned over and jumped, and scored first. How could Jinan be weak? Cai Yanxiong immediately retaliated, dedicating his treasure under the basket. Kuang Yao Ya was unwilling to show weakness, adding icing on the cake. Chihchih's Lu Zhixin struggled extremely and also scored. Cai Yanxiong supported the moon and went straight to Huanglong. When the battle reached seven to five, Chihchih saw that the situation was not good and requested a timeout to secretly discuss strategies, but it still did not turn the situation around. Cai Yanxiong hit three of three shots, and the score soared. At this time, it seemed to be Jinan's world. The three generals Yin, Kuang, and Cai attacked together, and Chihchih had no resistance. At this point, Chihchih's Chen Yunwan was furious, raised his arms and stood up, and actually lived up to expectations, building an offensive and returning to the division. However, he still fell into a slump after that. Kuang Yao Ya took advantage of the chaos and hit three more goals. Before long, the first half ended, and Jinan took the lead with twenty-five to nine.</p>
<p>Chihchih Submits: At the beginning of the second half, Chihchih changed its lineup. Center Jian Cheng was changed to left forward, and the remaining center position was taken by jumping star Zhang Jia. After contact, Chihchih made a sudden move. Zhang Jia got the ball and ran happily, breaking a bloody path and rushing to the basket, then jumped up and scored into the net, opening the sinking game. Jinan was not discouraged by this. Kuang Yao Ya ambushed at the bottom of the basket, receiving the supply from Yuan Zejian and immediately returned the color. Chen Yunwan was silent and also scored a long shot. Jinan's Cai Yanxiong had a plan in mind and was not in a hurry, and rode side by side with Kuang Yao Ya, and sure enough, they succeeded in one fell swoop, taking the lead with eleven to seven again. Chihchih then transferred Lin Qiming and re-used He Zheng, and Jinan also took the opportunity to transfer the new force Yang Minwen Chen Chunxiu, but saw the iron hooves of the Jinan generals trampling in the formation from time to time, and soon, the silver whistle blew for a long time, and the two sides ceased fighting and collected their troops. Jinan defeated Chihchih again with twenty-four to thirteen, and the total result was forty-nine to twenty-two, Jinan's victory. According to Jinan, this decision was due to Wang Nanzhen's absence due to a leg injury, and the strength was slightly inferior. Wu Zhedang will have more wonderful performances. The hope of this year's cotton standard is quite strong.</p>

<h3>Points for Improving Education in Yunnan Province: Ministry of Education Orders Distribution of Chen Lijiang's Report</h3>
<p>Chen Lijiang returned from inspecting education in Yunnan Province. His inspection impressions were published in this newspaper. Now, the Ministry of Education has issued a formal report of the changes, and the original text of all instructions to the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education is recorded as follows: According to the report submitted to the Ministry by Inspector Chen Lijiang after inspecting education in the province, after review, the Ministry hereby indicates the points that should be improved in the province as follows:</p>
<p>1. Regarding Elementary Education: In order to promote ethnic education in border areas, the Department should promptly increase the number of provincial elementary schools in border areas and poor and remote counties and districts. The province and all counties and districts should immediately organize primary education research associations in accordance with the elementary school regulations to improve primary education. The county and municipal elementary schools in the province all start in the spring, and the textbooks used all start in the autumn. As a result, the content of the teaching materials often does not match the season. It is urgent to order the adoption of textbooks for spring starts and to order the provincial elementary schools to compile local teaching materials to remedy this.</p>
<p>2. Regarding Compulsory Education: The short-term elementary schools that have been opened in the counties of the province are mostly attached to ordinary elementary schools. The counties should be ordered to set up separate schools as soon as possible so as to meet the original plan. The 300,000 yuan of compulsory education subsidies raised by the province should all be collected and disbursed by the Department of Finance, and allocated to the counties on a monthly basis, and distributed to the counties on a regular basis to facilitate facilities. The compulsory education funds that should be raised by the counties should be ordered to be raised in full, and detailed measures should be jointly formulated with the Department of Finance in accordance with the outline of the temporary measures for raising compulsory education funds in the provinces, counties, and cities promulgated by the Central Government, and issued to the counties for compliance. The counties in the province have set up short-term elementary schools, and there are still those that have not been opened or have not been fully opened. They should be ordered to open all the schools in full according to the original regulations.</p>
<p>3. Regarding Secondary and Normal Education: There are too many secondary school teachers serving concurrently. The proportion of concurrent and full-time teachers stipulated in the revised secondary school regulations should be followed, and more full-time teachers should be hired. The detailed measures for the plan to build new school buildings in the secondary schools in the provincial capital should be formulated and sent to the Ministry. Once approved, construction must begin as soon as possible to meet the needs. There are many provincial secondary schools in the provincial capital. Methods should be found to relocate some of them to other counties to achieve uniform distribution. All secondary schools should strictly abide by the restrictions on the number of students in each class in the revised secondary school regulations so as not to be too crowded and hinder the efficiency of teaching. If there are still schools in the province that combine middle school and normal school, efforts should be made to reform them so that they comply with the Ministry's orders to separate middle schools and normal schools. The normal schools in Qujing and Yongchang districts are still missing and should be established as soon as possible, and a women's normal school should be added in Kunming in the 25th year, and the normal school department of Kunhua Girls' High School should be merged. The provincial normal schools should be responsible for guiding the elementary schools in their respective districts, and should also assist in handling the in-service training of elementary school teachers in their respective districts. The provincial simple teacher should focus on the training of teachers in rural elementary schools, and should be attached to or specially used for rural elementary schools for internship purposes.</p>
<p>4. Regarding Vocational Education: There are no vocational schools for girls in the province. They should be held in the next year. If there is a need to set up business vocational schools in the province, they should also be planned to be established. All vocational schools should be attached to vocational supplementary schools or vocational training classes that meet local needs. The equipment and recurring expenses of all vocational schools should be increased and the content should be enriched separately. The internship time of all vocational schools should be increased immediately, at least accounting for 50% of the total teaching hours. Counties should establish junior vocational schools in accordance with local vocational conditions.</p>
<p>The above points must be followed for improvement, and the handling situation should be reported as soon as possible for record. This order.</p>

<h3>Boy Scout Cadre Training Class: Jiangsu Province Preliminary Examination Results Announced, Eleven Admitted, Three Alternates</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Council of the China Boy Scouts yesterday handed over the results of the preliminary examination for the cadre training class to committee members Zhou Shao Cheng, Shi Shun Yuan, Wu Jian Zhen, and others for detailed review. The result was eleven admitted students, including Wang Yuan Ren, and three alternates, including Cheng Shou Mo. The list of those who passed the preliminary examination is attached below.

Meeting notices have already been sent out separately, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Order: Increase Funding for Social Education in Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Department of Education considers the implementation of mass education to be an important task for restoring the nation. According to recent surveys, among the more than 20 million people in Zhejiang Province, more than 9.9 million are illiterate adults. If these people compete with educated citizens, destruction will be imminent. Although various counties and cities have been urged to increase funding for social education in recent years, it only accounts for about 11 percent, and never reaches 20 percent. Moreover, the actual expenditure is even less than the listed figures, making it difficult to develop mass education. A special order is issued to all counties and cities to substantially increase funding for social education before compiling the budget for the 25th year. Those that have already reached 20 percent should allocate 30 to 50 percent of the new education funds to social education funds and must spend them according to the budget without arbitrarily reducing expenditures or hindering the development of the cause. Efforts should be made to encourage private donations to establish mass undertakings to supplement the lack of public funds.</p>
<h3>Gansu Province Establishes Hui and Tibetan Primary Schools</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou, 18th) The Department of Education has drafted an education plan for the Hui and Tibetan people, establishing ten Hui primary schools in counties such as Lanzhou and Linxia, and three Tibetan primary schools in counties such as Xiahe and Lintan. The expenses will be paid from the border education subsidy.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Divides Guanzhong Area into Five Education Districts</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th) The Shaanxi Department of Education has divided the counties in the Guanzhong area into five education supervision districts, dispatching personnel to guide each district and inspect the progress of education improvement.</p>
<h3>University Education Association Establishes Hebei-Shandong Education Inspection Group, Yesterday's Letter Invited University Professors to Participate Freely, Inspection Target is Higher Education in Various Locations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Association is now planning to take advantage of the spring break to organize a Hebei-Shandong Education Inspection Group. Yesterday, the association sent letters to various universities in this city, soliciting professors to participate freely. The cost per person is tentatively set at fifty yuan, and a meeting is scheduled to be held on the 27th of this month at the association's headquarters on Avenue Foch to discuss inspection matters. It is expected to depart at the end of this month. It is reported that the inspection period is scheduled for ten days, and the route is set to include Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping. The inspection target is the current status of higher education in these locations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Establishes Rules for Treatment of Students from Outside the Settlement Area in Various Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council schools have existing regulations. Since June 1933, after the original students are admitted, if their parents leave Shanghai, these students, unless there are special circumstances and have been reported to the Education Committee for special consideration, will generally not be allowed to re-enroll. When parents leave Shanghai, they should take their children out of school. According to this regulation, which was established in December 1932, it has been implemented ever since, and there have been no special circumstances that have been exceptionally dealt with. However, the Director of Education, in view of the surplus of student places in the Council schools, believes that the old regulations should be slightly revised to allow the above-mentioned students to continue their studies after paying additional tuition fees. The acceptance of these students does not result in additional expenses for the school, and students from outside the Settlement Area studying in Council schools within the Settlement Area generally pay 25 percent more than students who are residents of the Settlement Area, and this precedent can be followed. When the Education Committee held a meeting the other day, the Director of Education submitted this proposal for discussion. One of the committee members expressed agreement, stating that students who are residents of the Settlement Area should have priority for admission, and parents of students from outside the Settlement Area and parents who leave Shanghai should be informed in advance that, if the number of student places is full in the future, students from outside the Settlement Area and other students may have to leave the school at any time. After discussion by the committee, the old regulations were approved to be changed, allowing students whose parents have left Shanghai to continue their studies in Council schools under the following conditions: 1. The circumstances of each student should be individually considered and decided by the Director of Education; 2. Each student's admission must wait until there is a definite surplus of places in the school and the class they are to enter; 3. The admission of each student must not increase the school's expenses; 4. The fees paid by each student should be 25 percent higher than the usual fees; 5. Parents who pay taxes to the Shanghai International Settlement should have priority for admission to Council schools, and if there are insufficient student places and it is difficult to accommodate all students, other students should be asked to leave the school to make room. It is reported that the above new regulations were approved by the Board of Directors yesterday.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (II) (O) (5)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiao Cang</p>
<p>"I am already a declining old woman, but I am also a happy old woman, so don't pity me, Tandy," she said, looking around with an expression full of genuine satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the success of your plan is increasing with each year," he said, nodding solemnly at the cheerful scene before him to express his approval.</p>
<p>"How could I fail since I have received so much help from you?" Madam Shu replied, showing a deep expression of gratitude to her greatest benefactor.</p>
<p>"Your school and its success - it really is the biggest joke in our family. It is very different from the life we ​​intended for you, but in the end, it is most suitable for you. This is a good idea, Shu," Lao Li said, still avoiding her gratitude as usual.</p>
<p>"Ah, but you were the first to laugh at that idea, and you still laugh at me and my ideas. Didn't you expect coeducation to be a complete failure? But now you see how good the results are," she pointed to the group of boys and girls dancing, singing, and talking together. A feeling of congeniality was most obvious.</p>
<p>"I surrender, and when my Jin'er grows up a little, I will send her to you too. Do you think I need to say anything else?"</p>

<h3>Old Affection</h3>
<p>— Quan Heng</p>
<p>It happened several days ago. The office messenger brought me a visitor slip. For this lonely girl who had been here for half a year without a single visitor or letter, I saw a surprised, doubtful look in his eyes.</p>
<p>My heart also suddenly stopped. It wasn't surprising that a visitor came, but I was surprised that anyone knew my address. For the sake of my work and to avoid excessive attention from others, I hardly revealed a single word about my personal life to relatives and friends for the past six months.</p>
<p>How did the visitor know that I was eating here? I couldn't help but turn from surprise to anxiety.</p>
<p>I examined the visitor slip in my hand. On it, two beautiful characters were clearly written, "Zhi Rong." This name was really unfamiliar to me. I thought about the familiar friends in my memory. None of my many friends had such a name. However, upon closer inspection of the handwriting, it seemed like I had seen it somewhere before. No, this handwriting should have been written by a friend I used to be very familiar with. Otherwise, why would it evoke the blurred shadows in my mind as soon as it caught my eye?</p>
<p>"Is it Hua? Could it be that Hua is here to see me? No, we have parted ways because we are on different paths."</p>
<p>With a hesitant heart, risking danger (logically, I shouldn't rashly run out to meet a guest), I followed the messenger's guidance and ran to the reception room.</p>
<p>"Yi, how are you?" It was such a crisp voice. Half a year ago, when we were at school, I never dreamed that this rough voice would come from Hua's throat, which was as gentle as the spring breeze in March. Standing straight in front of me was a transformed young woman.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you, Hua!" I exclaimed. A sharp spear, which had become distant and even contemptuous because of the different aspirations of each person, was now turning back to pierce my own heart. I felt guilty, or rather, ashamed. I had misjudged people. And Hua, this girl on whom I could swear I could no longer find a trace of the old, her large, dark palms had already pulled up my drooping right hand and were holding it so tightly.</p>
<p>"Yi, you made me look so hard. As soon as I heard you ran to Shanghai, I immediately followed. I thought you would run to the place you always said you should go. I ran there to find you, but you weren't there. I tried every means to inquire about your whereabouts, but still no luck. However, I always firmly believed that you must be in Shanghai. I believed that Yi was not someone who would easily turn back. Until the day before yesterday, I finally saw you in a place. Yi, you won't believe that among so many other types of people, there was someone who was Hua. I was staring at you with such affectionate eyes, and my heart was so excited that tears almost came to my eyes. Yi, I know that coming to see you in this place may be detrimental to you, but passion made me risk everything. I must come and see you. I have so much to tell you. We have been apart for half a year."</p>
<p>Shaking my hand vigorously, with great force.</p>
<p>"We have been apart for half a year." These words were heavily nailed into my heart. What have I done in half a year? I abandoned the closest companion I had when walking. I vaingloriously used reasons to protect myself. As such a cowardly person, I am not worthy of receiving the hearts full of warmth and love from my friends!</p>
<p>I must give myself a severe punishment. Only by stripping off my coat without any concealment can I be worthy of my friends. Yes, I must do this. From now on, if I don't take big steps forward, I can't be considered a person!</p>
<p>Seeing that I didn't respond, Hua thought I was thinking about something and lowered her voice and said, "Yi, why don't you speak? We have the same sun, and we are walking towards the sun together. Why aren't you happy when you hear that I am also happily rushing on my way?" Saying this, she still stood straight in front of me, like an incomparably solemn solid pagoda.</p>
<p>I laughed, I laughed loudly. Only crazy laughter could cover up the painful self-reproach in my heart. I should rejoice that I was forcefully pulled back from the trap that was about to devour me by a friend. This friend is the pen that I lightly dropped.</p>
<p>At the time, I only thought, "What does it matter to lose a friend? Losing a friend like Hua is like a grain of sand being swept away by the wind in the sandy sea of Guanghan."</p>
<p>Now, our teacher's words are ringing in my ears again. If I remember correctly, that was when we were launching a huge wave to demand the truth. We frantically abandoned our studies, time, and energy to fight for freedom. We wanted to open up a flat road for future sisters, but our result was to sacrifice ourselves under the claws of fierce eagles. The truth was buried, we cursed the truth, and we cursed everyone!</p>
<p>On the last day we were forced to leave the women's normal school, the teacher's trembling figure appeared before us. He said, "Children! Don't be discouraged by small setbacks! A grain of sand cannot build a solid pagoda. You can't relax. You should stick together closely."</p>
<p>I was the first to deny the teacher's words. I was the first to abandon old affection and give up all hope.</p>
<p>Hua was also smiling, with radiance on her face. "Sit down." Only now did I think that we should sit down and have a hearty conversation. I wanted to list my shortcomings and mistakes in front of Hua and let her give me a severe criticism.</p>
<p>Who says that the chains of affection cannot bind the feet of two pedestrians who have already separated? As long as more hard metal is infiltrated inside, and we have the same bright sun above our heads, under such good sunlight, what reason do we have not to walk the same road, for the sake of our work and career, and insist on ignoring each other across a small stream?</p>
<p>The old affection made my and Hua's cheeks flush red.</p>
<h3>The Dying Man's Proposition</h3>
<p>— Long Gong Gong</p>
<p>Seventy or eighty men and women were forced by prolonged floods to flee from their villages to a hilltop. They lived a life of hunger, cold, and disease there, waiting for their end. The opinions of leaving and holding fast clashed fiercely among the crowd. Those who thought the latter were more numerous. They could not leave the submerged villages that contained all of their belongings. Although they had not calculated how many more days they could endure hunger and illness, they believed that the water would eventually recede back into the river.</p>
<p>Every day was gloomy and dreary, carrying with it endless resentment - sometimes without realizing why it was happening. The sun had disappeared from the sky forever, replaced by overlapping, thick clouds. These clouds, which were not easily dispersed, shamelessly occupied the top of people's heads, constantly changing colors, milky white, gray-black... swelling, trying their best to swallow every corner of the sky's relatively clear fragments - the souls of people had once tied their hopes firmly to those fragments through the black clouds. The next heavy rain, the river water that had climbed ashore - even prepared to climb the hilltop - rose even higher. The soaking wet humans dried in the cold wind... Some died, some worsened their illnesses - constituting the most obvious changes on the hilltop.</p>
<p>One drizzly, somewhat cold summer afternoon, they were again discussing their actions, when a dying man contributed his forceful opinion.</p>
<p>Xu Xing, the man suffering from heatstroke, crawled over on his hands and knees like a wooden horse... He stopped, his sideburns covered in saliva and mud began to move, and his mouth spat out hissing breaths. "Go to Detou Village!" - his eyes were like ripe Chinese tallow fruits, and he said the name of the village with difficulty.</p>
<p>The people surrounding him were moved by an unusually poignant feeling, holding their breath, and no one was willing to interrupt his words at this moment. A man who advocated leaving was feeling the need for someone to help him prove his point, and he was shaking all over; a woman used her hand to forcefully hold down her small, clever nose.</p>
<p>Large and unadorned, the dying Xu Xing spoke.</p>
<p>"...Don't think you can save me... My wife, these two people, and those three over there! Tell me what you plan to use to save those sick people! Stupid and strange... Simply, stupid and strange! Crooked-mouth Sanmao said: a life for a life - that's what he says when he wants to kill someone. What a joke, villagers! You compensate us - but what good is it to us? - Leave, you bastards, old whores! This has nothing to do with you: when we die, we will crawl into the mud ourselves!... My soul still has to hurry up and be reincarnated. If you all die here, you won't let me go. Ungrateful things... People forget their conscience when disaster strikes. They even block their noses and become silly dogs that people laugh at! Your noses can only smell out the old road back home, but there's no food, clothing, or housing there, no relatives, friends, ancestors, or gods - nothing!... "I'll make good food, but there's nothing to give you. Go away and find it yourself!" I've been saying this for thirteen years... Don't your noses smell where there is food? You're lazy. Go find the county magistrate - don't rely on anyone - tell him yourselves: you must eat something. That's it, you must eat something!..."</p>
<p>His strength gave out, and he fell down. Later, they decided to leave... Xu Xing could not leave, that was clear. He had told others that he was prepared to help decide their path to survival by dying.</p>

<p>No sign of a hoe-wielding man wearing the moon,</p>
<p>No sign of a herdsman driving a flock of sheep,</p>
<p>The dry wind crawls across the wilderness,</p>
<p>Raising alarming drought.</p>
<p>Loneliness! Depression!</p>

<h3>A Farce in Prison</h3>
<p>— Simu</p>
<p>This is a prison, no, a model prison. Compared to the old-style jails or detention centers, it is indeed magnificent. Let's not talk about anything else; even the watchtower is imposing enough. It stands exquisitely high in the sky, visible even to the turbaned guards carrying long guns within a ten-mile radius. One side is dark, while a bright, shimmering electric light hangs above, flickering like the eye of a demon, like an evening star rising in the West – yes, it is the star to which the fates of several thousand people are tied. As usual, the surrounding walls are towering, even though they are reinforced with steel-like concrete. Within the walls, "iron" reigns supreme; layer upon layer of gates, fences, rows of long guns beside the doors, and thousands upon thousands of chains and shackles within form the kingdom of "iron." The dull, heavy sound of the doors opening and closing – the sound of "iron"; interspersed with a string of crisp, tinkling, strange sounds – the strange sound of "iron." Windows with iron bars are set high, but the corridors, lit by electric lights even in broad daylight, are still shrouded in gloom.</p>
<p>A prison is a prison, forever!</p>
<p>The iron gates of the warehouse opened one after another. A monk dressed like an ascetic, led by a chaplain and surrounded by a group of men and women holding prayer beads, strode in with measured steps and a swagger. But don't imagine this is the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha inspecting hell, or even Maudgalyayana breaking through hell, because this is just the human world.</p>
<p>The group stopped in a large, lecture hall-like room upstairs, covered with motto plaques. After sitting down for only a moment, a flurry of wooden clogs clattering and scraping, mixed with the sound of iron, surged in. Staggering in single file were more than twenty male prisoners – some with shackles on one foot, others without shackles but resembling soft-footed geese. Following them, a noisy group of female prisoners led by female guards, some carrying children and infants, poured in. As soon as the two sides finished their puppet-like bows with palms together, the old woman in charge of the prison glared and shouted, "What's all the racket? Sit properly!" The faint smiles that had appeared on some faces upon entering, like the pale yellow light of a winter sun, vanished instantly.</p>
<p>Apart from two or three young juvenile offenders who insisted on standing, the seats barely accommodated everyone. The eyes of the men and women "devotees" (let me call them that) who had come with the monk turned to the prisoners in unison, carefully scrutinizing them. Among them were young men wearing old Western suits and trousers, and women with their hair styled like young mistresses, but a particular type dominated them – especially the male prisoners. First of all, the eyes hidden in deep-set sockets were so dull and gloomy, like ancient bronze mirrors buried in millennial soil, their luster worn away clean by endless nights. In these eyes, sorrow, pain, resentment, despair, and emptiness congealed and stagnated. Deeply sunken cheeks, high cheekbones, and long, expressionless lips held a powerful expression. Complexions were deathly pale, swollen and yellow, or crimson, as red as the feverish flush of a tuberculosis patient. In a word, the outlines of poor men's heads in cartoon collections, the faces of misery and baseness in fortune-telling charts in front of fortune-telling shops, found their approximate forms here.</p>
<p>"Esteemed Buddhist friends," a low, muffled voice began to emerge from the Dharma master's mouth, "Today, I will be speaking to you about the 'Three Realms, Six Paths, and Ten Karmas'..."</p>
<p>The Dharma master's long hair and beard, set off by a long, wide black cotton-padded coat, resembled Rasputin, the grand monk of pre-revolutionary Russia.</p>
<p>"What are the Six Paths? The upper three realms are the realms of gods, humans, and Asuras; the lower three realms are hell, hungry ghosts, and animals... The suffering of the eighteen levels of hell is endless to describe, fifty years being but a single day and night, truly a long, long night!" The Dharma master then went on to depict the hungry ghosts with a smile, describing their necks like lamp wicks, bellies as big as cauldrons, swallowing fire as food, reciting like a book, interspersing colloquialisms with classical language. When he spoke of "non-killing," "non-stealing," and "non-lust" in "physical karma," words like "nation," "law," "social order," and "morality" tumbled out along with "hell" and "retribution."</p>
<p>The warm afternoon sun shone in from the southwest window, a patch of brightness cast on the floor, on the shoulders and faces of the prisoners. The southern breeze that blew in was stiflingly hot and heavy with moisture. The stacks of distant mountains and patches of mixed trees outside the east window sparkled with golden light. Everything outside seemed to be bursting with vitality. A pair of small birds fluttered in from the south window, chirping and squabbling without avoiding people. Spring had arrived in the human world, and it came early, carrying the heat of early summer. The faces of several female devotees sitting on the side counting prayer beads were strangely flushed, and a fashionable, curly-haired girl yawned frequently. Even the Dharma master's face, darkened by his long beard and hair, was full of smiles and spring, and he spoke with increasing enthusiasm, clumsily inserting a joke or two.</p>
<p>But apart from the occasional sound of infants crying, the footsteps of the female guards patrolling, and the familiar sounds of chains and shackles sent in from outside from time to time, the whole room was still shrouded in silence. Many of the listeners had their eyes tightly closed, like animals dozing during the day in a zoo. Reflected in the golden sunlight, their faces appeared even paler. A five- or six-year-old child was climbing on the window frame, joyfully looking out. The juvenile offenders were sprawled on the floor, one of them concentrating intently on peeling the scabs on the back of his hand with great interest. Spring had finally crept in here too!</p>
<p>"Studying Buddhism is not just about understanding; the most important thing is practice," the Dharma master said briefly about the great principles of cultivation, and today's Dharma talk came to an end. The curly-haired female devotee who had been yawning frequently sighed in relief. "Here are some prayer beads," the chaplain thanked the Dharma master and then said with a smile to the prisoners, "A devotee bought them to give to Buddhist friends who have already taken refuge. Whoever has taken refuge, please raise your hand."</p>
<p>More than a dozen people raised their hands. Strings of small yellow prayer beads were distributed to them, scrutinized and fondled. Several people were left empty-handed. Waves of joy and envy rippled through the audience.</p>
<p>Then came another round of bows with palms together, a flurry of wooden clogs, shackles, and the sound of iron doors opening and closing.</p>
<p>As the monk and his entourage walked out of the downstairs corridor, some heads craned downward in the iron-barred windows on both sides of the high walls, their eyes full of resentment, murmuring as if cursing someone.</p>
<p>"That female murderer who dismembered her concubine can't be seen again today," a female devotee whispered to her companion with disappointment.</p>
<p>Outside, the gentle southern breeze continued to blow, and the yellow setting sun continued to shine. The shadows of the monk and his entourage had disappeared. Within the high walls, the flawless reign of the "iron" monarchy was once again in complete control.</p>
<p>A prison is a prison, forever!</p>
<h3>Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin"</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>This February marks the centenary of the death of Pushkin, the genius poet of Russia. As everyone knows, Pushkin is the founder of modern Russian literature. Of course, in fact, before Pushkin (from the early eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century), modern Russian literature had already begun to sprout in Russia. During this period, historians and novelists such as Karamzin and the poet Zhukovsky imported Western European sentimentalism and romanticism into Russia through creation or translation. But, generally speaking, that was only the period of introduction and imitation of Western European literature, and at best, it only laid a stepping stone for modern Russian literature in the strict sense. It was not until Pushkin appeared on the literary scene like a bright star that he used the light and power of his genius to illuminate a clear path for modern Russian literature and lay a solid foundation. Some people would call Pushkin the Peter the Great of the Russian literary world, which is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Although Pushkin died very early (because of his wife, he fought a duel and was killed, at the age of only thirty-seven), his works are unusually rich. Among the most famous are the long narrative poem "Ruslan and Ludmila", the long lyrical poem "Eugene Onegin", the historical drama "Boris Godunov", and the short story "The Captain's Daughter", etc. The long narrative poem "Eugene Onegin" is especially recognized as the most outstanding and the most representative work that can express the author's amazing genius; unless you don't talk about Pushkin at all, otherwise, you have to talk about it: just as we talk about Dostoevsky and we cannot but talk about "Crime and Punishment", and when we talk about Tolstoy, we cannot but talk about "War and Peace".</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about "Eugene Onegin".</p>
<p>From 1823, our poet began to write this work, but it was interrupted intermittently. It was not until 1831 that he finished it; it took almost ten years to complete.</p>
<p>In 1823, the poet wrote a letter from Odessa to a friend in St. Petersburg, in which he said the following: "What I am writing at the moment is not a novel, but a novel in verse – there is a very sharp difference between the two!" ... What I am writing at the moment is a rambling narrative poem..."</p>
<p>The so-called "novel in verse" and "narrative poem" refer to "Eugene Onegin".</p>
<p>Pushkin's work is not only a masterpiece among the poet's many masterpieces, but also occupies the most important position in the history of Russian literature; since this work, Russia has had its true modern literature. It is no wonder that Gogol said that the appearance of Pushkin's work was a "very important event" for Russia.</p>
<p>The plot that constitutes this narrative poem (novel in verse) is, in the simplest terms, as follows: Onegin (the protagonist of the book) is a rich young man, a nobleman's son, who lives in the social world. He has received some shallow education and can still speak a few words of French, which was necessary for the Russian social world at the time. All day long, and all night long, he is only indulging in a life of luxury and pleasure. One summer, he lived in a villa and became close friends with a young poet next door named Lensky. Also, through Lensky's introduction, he met a female landlord in a neighboring village. This female landlord has two daughters, the elder one named Tatyana, and the younger one named Olga. The younger one does not have much thought, but the elder one is a girl with a brain. Lensky loves Olga, and their love has reached the point of getting married soon. Tatyana has a great crush on Onegin at first sight; but he does not pay much attention to her, and is only fond of Olga. Therefore, he dueled with Lensky; killed him, and was forced to leave that place. Although Tatyana still loved Onegin, she later married a noble and wealthy man at her mother's order, and became a social star in the metropolis. Once, Onegin met her again. He suddenly changed his past indifferent attitude and wrote many letters to woo her; but she ignored them. One night, he sneaked into her house, but found her reading his letters with tears in her eyes. So, he tried his best to woo her; but was finally rejected by her. Her rejection of him was extremely gentle and tactful, and it is the most beautiful section of the whole poem. According to Kropotkin, women of the Russian era could not help but sigh and shed tears when they read that passage.</p>
<p>The great writer Dostoevsky, when the Pushkin statue in Moscow was unveiled, gave a very famous speech, which involved this work and said the following:</p>
<p>"Pushkin created two typical characters, Onegin and Tatyana. They are a synthesis of the most intimate secrets of the Russian psychology. According to Pushkin's amazing and highest skills, these two characters express the past and present of Russia, and at the same time, they also imply the future that contains unparalleled beautiful characteristics."</p>
<p>As Dostoevsky said, Onegin and Tatyana are two typical characters created by Pushkin. Onegin, whether from his thoughts, actions, or any aspect of his life, can be said to be the representative and incarnation of the Russian intellectual class in the early nineteenth century. Therefore, in this sense, the type created by Pushkin - Onegin, can be compared with Lermontov's Pechorin (a modern hero), Turgenev's Rudin, Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov (Crime and Punishment), etc., and constitute an important chain in the history of the living Russian intellectual class. This means that Pushkin's Onegin is actually the "ancestor" of the type of intellectuals that have continuously appeared in Russian literature in later days. As for Tatyana, it is even more obviously a typical Russian woman. She is a child of nature born from the black soil and forests of Russia; she is a woman who embodies the Russian national spirit expressed in Russian folk tales and folk songs, simple and straightforward but at the same time possessing a mysterious and profound spirit. To find the potential beautiful spirit in the dark and chaotic national life, to create this undiminished type of beauty, and to be able to stand on solid ground and never fall into romantic idealization, this is really a talent worthy of admiration! At the same time, this is also the unreachable aspect of this work!</p>
<p>Pushkin is not a stranger to us, just like Tolstoy and Turgenev. Some of his works have long been imported into China. But, unfortunately, this work, which is the most perfect crystallization of this unparalleled genius, has not been translated yet, which is really a pity! Therefore, I hope that someone will come out to do the work of translation in the near future, so that everyone can have the opportunity to appreciate this exotic flower.</p>

<h3>Finance · Interbank Investment in Commodities Market · Gold Market Trading Thins</h3>
<p>Yesterday Only One Yuan Up and Down · Resulting in Slight Fall of Three Angles</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was dominated by retail investors and traded within a one-yuan range throughout the day. Trading was even thinner. This is because interbank institutions are investing in the commodities market. It will be difficult to expand in the near future.

<h3>Hua Merchants Slightly Sell US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw Hua merchants slightly selling US dollars, with banks bidding close for near-term and selling far-term, resulting in a slightly firmer market. Initially, according to foreign telegrams, London's major transactions should remain unchanged in the near term, with the forward rate narrowing to 0.0625. After adjusting the floor price at the close, there was talk of a small number of large transactions being concluded at the listed price. New York's silver market remained unchanged, and the forward silver price in Montedori remained unchanged, fluctuating between an increase of 5 cents and a decrease of 1.5 cents. London's raw gold rose by half a penny, the British pound against the US dollar remained unchanged, the US dollar against the British pound narrowed by 1.5 cents, the British pound against the French franc remained unchanged, and the US dollar against the French franc narrowed by 375. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable. Customs gold units remained unchanged. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of the British pound at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4375, and half a penny as a premium, and the US dollar at 30 yuan. Compared to the previous closing price, both the British pound and the US dollar remained stable. After opening, banks slightly bid for near-term US dollars, and the process was stable. The Shanghai &amp; Hong Kong Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable. Thereafter, banks dealt in shillings at par. The silver balance tax announcement remained unchanged. Although Western merchants were selling shillings, Chinese banks seized the opportunity to bid when prices were low, so it was difficult for any changes to occur in the process. The same was true at noon. Later in the market, there was a slight selling of Eastern currencies and bidding for the British pound, and the situation was re-evaluated. There were not many transactions. Chinese merchants and banks slightly engaged in swap transactions.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, trading increased compared to before, and market prices could also be considered slightly active. Because the number 4 bulls were slightly liquidating, and feeling that market prices were not making much progress at the time, they gradually divested, but only sold at high prices, and there was no rush to sell, and it remained in a state of brewing. The dispute between Germany and France, and the negotiations between China and Japan, are all about maneuvering for advantage and employing their diplomatic skills to obtain considerable benefits while avoiding war. Therefore, future developments and changes are closely related to public debt market prices. In this chaotic period, although the March futures delivery is imminent, the number of state bonds is not large and will not cause any infighting. In the short term, it will only revolve around.

For types A and B, number 4 made slight purchases, while number 47 turned to selling. Therefore, type B fell by 6.5 jiao, which was the largest decrease, followed by type C, which decreased by 5.5 jiao. In the second session, individual retail investors continued to sell. Sales by number 4 were rare. At the initial opening, types E and D continued to decrease by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. After entering, numbers 32 and 48 and others all made purchases. Starting from type C, it gradually became firm, recovering 5 fen to 1 jiao.

The closing transaction was more active. Type D was not traded at all. For the rest, types E and C recovered by 1.5 jiao, and types A and B recovered by 5 fen to 1 jiao, and then returned to a revolving path. In the future, if number 4 does not reappear, the market price will still be mostly sluggish. The result of one day's market price was a uniform decrease of 1 jiao to 4 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the markets for all months continued to be sluggish. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell back by 1-2 jiao. Moreover, as international events have eased slightly, the factories have continued to inquire about spot foreign wheat. Once the market price rises, it is inevitable that foreign wheat will be hedged. Therefore, buyers outside the industry also felt that it was difficult to retreat, and it was not as smooth as it was a few days ago. The half-day transaction was only about 300,000 yuan. The far-term market also fell back by about 1 point. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to weak buying, the factories continued to ship, causing some bulls to return, and the market continued to be weak.

Therefore, although the Bo Dao market included the Qingdao and Yantai helpers buying more than 2,000 bales, the resulting market was still a few fen higher for the higher ones, and the middle and lower ones were a few jiao lower. The destocking in this street was extremely desolate. Although the arrival of goods was scarce, the price of thick early and other japonica rice still fell by 1 jiao, and the Yinbianyuan was weak.

Although spot transactions were not opened, the market could not help but fall. The buying and selling of Che Yellow Beans went in opposite directions, so the market became stagnant.

Yesterday, 1,200 bales were opened, and they were purchased by Wintai etc. on this street.</p>

<p>Spot tin has recently been in short supply and shallow bottom, so the market trend is quite consolidated. However, the Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou gangs generally have a purchasing stomach, and the supply is sometimes less than the demand. Recently, due to the soaring overseas pricing, the market trend has become more outstanding. For example, Xiaohong tin is priced at 190 yuan per dan, which is 2 yuan higher than before. Dutch tin is 203 yuan, which is also 1 yuan better than before. Fuzu tin opened at 205 yuan, Yunnan slab tin 195 yuan, and Dou tin 200 yuan, all of which were much firmer than before.

<h3>Will Absolutely Not Trigger a World War</h3>
<p>— Blow</p>
<p>In recent years, dark clouds and a murderous atmosphere have shrouded the globe. People say that the god of war has descended upon Japan, Germany, and Italy, so their ambitions for aggression are like raging fire, as if the Second World War is imminent. This is a big difference, in fact. Whether the war is lost or won, the sacrifices are undoubtedly limitless. Even if it is won, the value of the sacrifices will be enormous. How can those countries not know this, and dare to defy the world by taking such dangerous actions, which seems unwise. But they have long expected that a serious war will not happen. If you don't believe it, please list the internal affairs of the great powers and dissect them one by one, and you will understand.</p>
<p>(1) Japan has invaded our country, inch by inch, with meticulous care. They know that our country has always been the most advocate of peace, and is determined to adhere to the principle of "I would rather people be unfair to me than I be unfair to others." Therefore, no matter how serious the oppression and occupation, they will never want to start a war with others. This is one point. Looking at the situation of the great powers, Germany and Italy in Europe are ambitious and unpredictable. Therefore, Britain, France, and other countries absolutely dare not interfere in the Far East situation. Although the United States is dissatisfied with Japan's behavior, it is restricted by the situation and cannot get the help of Britain, so it will never dare to take justice lightly. Russia's new five-year plan has not been completed, and it is afraid that Germany will spy on its back, so it dare not break easily. Japan has seen this point, so although it invades arbitrarily and unscrupulously, it will absolutely not cause a world war.</p>
<p>(2) The reason why Italy dared to use troops in Abyssinia is that it knew that A was an uncivilized country. There are only twelve aircraft in its country, and only eight pilots. The reason why the Italian military used troops in A was like entering an uninhabited area, and the odds of winning were controlled. This is one thing. And silently observing the situation in Europe, France is relying on Italy to control Germany, and it will never dare to quarrel with Italy. Without the help of France, Britain will not be able to use force to restrain Italy. It can be asserted that, on the one hand, it released the air of the German-Italian alliance, making Britain, France, and other countries even more afraid to stand up and make things difficult for Italy. Italy has seen this point, so it dares to cross the Mediterranean Sea to invade A, and it will absolutely not cause a world war.</p>
<p>(3) The German army decided to advance into the Rhineland area, the topic is to borrow the conclusion of the alliance between France and Russia, thinking that it violates the Locarno Treaty. In fact, Germany saw the weakness of European countries' dreams in the same bed. In the Italian-A war, France was unwilling to cooperate with Britain, then Germany's advance into the Rhineland, Britain may not be able to be consistent with France, this is one thing. Moreover, the situation in the Far East is becoming more and more tense. In case the countries have positive actions against Germany, Germany and Japan may be connected. This is the second thing. To go a step further, Japan's actions towards China and Italy's actions towards A are completely aggressive actions, and they still cannot be stopped. However, Germany's actions are only for self-defense, which is even more justified. This is the third thing. Germany has seen this point, so it dares to flex its muscles and advance troops into the Rhineland without any scruples, and it will not cause a world war.</p>
<p>Although the above three countries seem to be exhausting their military power and being fond of bragging, they have long calculated that they will never have a serious impact and get an unfortunate result, which is very clear. Therefore, the ancients said, only killing can stop killing. Hitler said, only in war can we get peace. If we seek peace from peace, the result will be war, which is really reasonable.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Books</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>— Casual Notes After Class</p>
<p>I've been working as a teacher in this small county town for two months now. On the first Sunday, I visited the only public sports ground, which had a small library attached. I sat inside for half a day, almost going through all the books. The librarian was a middle-aged man with extremely nearsighted glasses. Seeing that I was a stranger, he paid special attention to my movements. When I was flipping through the books on the shelves, he actually came out from his office, which was enclosed by a wooden fence, and asked me, as if interrogating me, what book I wanted to read. Since coming to this small county town, I haven't felt like talking much, and my colleagues are also quite distant. I feel like the people here have a particular stereotype, and the librarian is a representative of that. I could only smile at him. When he asked me the second time, I replied that I wanted to read something I wanted to read. Perhaps he saw that my attitude was firm, or perhaps he didn't understand my playful response, so he retreated to his corner office, looking disgruntled, although he was still keeping an eye on my movements. Finally, I came across a book that a friend in Shanghai had asked me to buy. Back then, I had searched every bookstore on the Four Roads and several of the more famous old book stalls inside and outside the city, but I couldn't find it. I wrote back to my friend, and he told me to keep an eye out and even borrow it to copy if possible. Now, I had unexpectedly found this book that I couldn't find anywhere else. I wanted to borrow it and send it to my friend by express mail, because I knew that the school principal here could borrow books from the library. So, I had to negotiate with the librarian. I first told him that I was a certain English teacher at the middle school here and wanted to borrow the book. He seemed surprised and suspicious. Actually, using psychology, the typical representative librarian should have been simultaneously experiencing surprise and suspicion battling each other. I knew that he was paying attention to my every move to guard against me being a book thief, but the person wearing a blue cotton robe was actually the English teacher at the middle school here. His dull eyeballs rolled behind the extremely thick lenses, as if trying to find some sign of me being an English teacher somewhere. We stood there, separated by the wooden fence, for a long time. This must have been a flash of inspiration for the librarian. He asked me, in broken English, how many years I had been an English teacher at the middle school. This small county town only has one middle school, which is</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>funded by the local government. The number of students is pitifully small, because families that have enough to eat and wear don't want to study, while school-aged children who want to study are helping their fathers and brothers with business. Therefore, each semester, the number of students graduating from elementary school who enter middle school is often less than one-tenth. The fact that the librarian could speak a few words of broken English could be considered the most outstanding talent in the county. But at that time, I laughed. Foolish people often try to be clever but actually do the most foolish things. I also answered him in English that I was definitely not a book thief and that using the book to wrap peanuts would be too wasteful. I didn't care whether he understood me or not, and I reached out and wrote my name and the name of the book I was borrowing on a piece of wood.</p>
<p>The next day, in the teachers' room, my friend the principal smiled and told me, "Last night, the librarian came to my house to ask about your name. He said he was very worried about you borrowing a book. I told him that you are an old friend of mine and that you came here to teach because of my reputation, so I would be responsible for the book. Only then did he say apologetically that he wanted to visit you today."</p>
<p>After hearing the principal's words, I didn't know whether to laugh or not. I hope that the students I teach will be even more foolish, or else my sins will be too great.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the librarian did indeed come to visit me. I told the tea servant to tell him that I was not at school. After that, I dared not go to the library again.</p>
<h3>Mr. Blind</h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>One of the Chronicles of My Hometown</p>
<p>Mr. Blind, wearing a clean blue homespun long gown, appeared on the main street at almost the same time every day. He shook the small copper bell in his left hand and used the stick in his right hand to probe the way, walking slowly forward. Mischievous children, wandering around the street without playing, saw Mr. Blind and followed him in a swarm, shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Blind, be careful, there's a ditch ahead."</p>
<p>"Mr. Blind, you're going to hit the wall, turn around quickly."</p>
<p>The children made faces, trying their best to trick him, all with a curious desire to see the blind man fall or fall into the ditch. Some, seeing that the blind man didn't believe their lies, would actually pull on the blind man's stick, leading him to places where there were real ditches and walls, only satisfied after deliberately causing him to bump into them.</p>
<p>The blind man couldn't help but get angry. Standing firm, neither forward nor backward, he said angrily: "You little devils, you have no conscience, you always want to joke with me." But as soon as he said that, he immediately put on a warm, pleading face: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening "Chu Hegemon"</p>
<p>Han Xin helped Liu establish great merit. He killed Xiang Yu and showed his prestige. Uprooting mountains and carrying tripods was useless. A lifetime of fame was lost in an instant. Pitifully chased to the Wujiang River. The waves were rough and the road was impassable. There was not a foot of flat land ahead. The pursuers were very fierce behind. Consort Yu is dead and Black Steed is gone. What face does the lonely king have to return to Jiangdong. Soldiers under the tent. Express your feelings. King is afraid of your head. A small boat is in the river. If you can cross the Wujiang River. Go to Jiangdong to see your father. Xiang Yu at this time had no choice. Quickly call the boatman for the lonely family. Who knows. The boat is small and the waves do not carry horses. This time, Chu Chongtong was anxious. Xiang Yu is afraid of you. Where are the eight thousand soldiers. Could it be that. Still as powerful as before. King is afraid. The elders of Jiangdong are looking forward. A complete success. King Xiang is. The wind and clouds change color. Anger fills his chest. Several years of hegemony is like a spring dream. The spirit of rushing to the sky is entrusted to the east wind. The lonely one will not go to Jiangdong today. You. Take my head and offer it as a reward. Suddenly, the sound of drums shook the heavens and the earth. Xiang Yu turned around and was even more angry. Look at the smoke and dust billowing and the pursuers arriving. The soldiers are like fierce tigers and the horses are like dragons. Only see that. Xiang Yu took Consort Yu as the first mate. Calling out to the beauty again and again. Beauty is afraid. I hoped to become a jade business in those years. I made you empress in Zhaoyang Palace. I know that today it has become a fantasy. Had to. I leave you in the river with a heavy heart. Han Xin is afraid of Han Xin. You. Divide the ten-sided soldiers and ambush. Killed us. Horses died and people died and blood stained red. Zhang Liang is afraid of Zhang Liang. You dispersed the eight thousand soldiers. How can I. No more face to turn to Jiangdong. At this moment, King Xiang only wished to die. He drew a green record from his waist. He committed suicide at Wujiang and blood flowed red.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am writing to you to say that I was surprised to read a report in the Yujin column of your newspaper that the Moonlight Society had expelled members Li Jinrong and Zhang Liang. We joined the Moonlight Society to connect friendships and learn from each other. There was no other purpose. Later, the Moonlight Society had internal opinions due to various reasons. We were afraid of being involved, so we withdrew voluntarily. This is not consistent with the fact that the Moonlight Society expelled members reported in your newspaper. In addition to serious negotiations with the Moonlight Society, we are deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and that it is related to our reputation. We hereby declare that we hope that this letter will be published in the Letters column. Sincerely wish you a happy spring. Li Jinrong and Zhang Liang</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>Xiao Zhenying held a grand celebration for his parents' 66th birthday. The preparation office started working two months ago. The decoration was extremely luxurious. Recalling Zhang Zongchang's grand birthday celebration in those years, it was still not as good. There were dozens of trees in the courtyard. Because the weather was cold and they had not sprouted, the velvet flower shop was ordered to adorn the trees with peach blossoms. In the cluster of flowers, red and green electric lights were also attached. They shone brightly at night, dazzlingly. Tan Lao San said that Emperor Yang of Sui was extravagant and extravagant, cutting ribbons to find spring. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand years later, he saw the grand occasion of the Xiao family again, which could not help but arouse the sigh of "The merchant girl does not know the hatred of the subjugated country, and she still sings the backyard flower across the river."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dylan of Benlunde Town, Ottarlo Province, Canada, gave birth to five children in one pregnancy. The government specially formulated a five-child protection bill and sent experts to take care of them, holding them up like pearls of the night. Tan Lao San said that these children, if they were reincarnated in the belly of a Chinese woman, would definitely not survive. Even if they survived, they would be a business in the big world. I ask those who oppose Mrs. Shanna to think deeply.</p>
<h3>Nora (12)</h3>
<p>— Painting by Wan Chao Chen Explanation by Xin Xin</p>
<p>After Krogstad left, Nora was frightened by those words, and a shadow enveloped her heart. Although she wanted to dispel and hide her panic by choosing flowers and decorating the Christmas tree, it was of no use.</p>
<p>At this time, Helmer came back. As soon as he came in, he asked if anyone had come. Although Nora wanted to lie, she couldn't hide it from Helmer. As a result, after being scolded by Helmer, Nora tried several times to ask Helmer to keep Krogstad's position, but she didn't have the courage to say it. In a state of unease, Nora reluctantly found a topic to cover up her concerns. She asked Helmer to think about what clothes she should wear for the costume ball at Stenborg's house the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Helmer looked at the documents in the bank, and at the same time talked about Krogstad's "incurable" and unbearable colleagues. He also said that this kind of fraudulent behavior would give their children a great poison.</p>

<h3>"Father and Son Heroes" is a Detective Drama</h3>
<p>"Father and Son Heroes" is a detective drama, a detective drama with a social improvement significance. Director Wang Cilong personally played the role of a sheriff in the drama. Others such as Hu Ping, Wang Yin, Wei Heling, Wang Naidong, Zhang Zhizhi, Han Langen, Jiang Xiu, Guan Hongda, Sun Zeyi, etc. all have roles that are very suitable for their personalities. Therefore, the filming of this film is undoubtedly establishing a superior detective drama type foundation for the Chinese film industry. At the same time, its contribution to social security has a meritorious achievement that cannot be obliterated. This film is now in active work and will be completed by the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Year After Year of Moonlight Night"</h3>
<p>"Year After Year of Moonlight Night," a full-sound dialogue and singing film produced by Jixing Company, written by Zuo Ming, directed by Lü Wenchao, and starring Gao Yian, Chen Baoqi, Wang Canzhang, Xie Mary, and Jin Feng, is a strange harvest in the domestic film industry this year, with both poetic meaning and extremely lingering and poignant plots.

It is agreed that the love story interspersed in the middle is commendable. The playwright's eye for profit, coupled with the director's agile skills, and the hard work of the actors, resulted in the film achieving a perfect and outstanding performance.

<h3>The Second Collection of "Cow Nose" is Published</h3>
<p>The First Collection is Reprinted</p>
<p>The Chinese humorous cartoon clown "Cow Nose" is scattered in major books and magazines in the north and south, and is loved by the old and the young. Its style is unique.</p>
<p>McLaughlin and child star Fraderdy Bartholomew, the two leading actors of "The Little Princess" are showing at the Great Light.</p>
<p>It uses extremely simple lines to create various vivid expressions and lively postures, and uses humorous tones to mock the social figures and ugly habits. It gathers the humorous points of all Chinese people to develop the full jokes of Chinese people. The protagonist, Cow Nose, is a short, fat man with a big belly, bow legs, a big wine-soaked nose, and four hairs on his head. He is already known as the number one comedian in Chinese comics. The "Cow Nose" book was published in March and became popular at home and abroad. It has sold tens of thousands of copies. It is now being reprinted. The editing style has been completely changed and the content has been increased. It is completely different from the first edition. The cover "Bread Cow Nose" and the back cover "Self-Portrait" are all ingenious craftsmanship. The two-color copper plate is finely printed, and four large pages of "Cruel World" are added in the middle, revealing the ferocity of people's hearts. All the little cow noses have completely replaced the new team, and the cartoonists Wan's brothers have added an article "Anatomy of Cow Nose", detailing the organization and painting method of Cow Nose, etc. The second collection is more exquisite and affectionate, the technique is more sophisticated, the lines are more pure, and the theme is more profound, making people never tire of reading it, and the taste is timeless. The little cow noses are more exciting, containing serious training meanings, but they are depicted with light lines. Four large pages are inserted in the middle. The grand scene, "Cow Nose's Grand Funeral", is exquisite and meticulous, with various shapes and colors, full of fun. The back cover is even more precious. "Fruit Cow Nose" and the face of the God of Wealth are made with silver coins, which is extremely ingenious. The ordinary one is only sold for 15 cents, breaking all low prices for books and newspapers. It will be published simultaneously on the 25th of this month and is distributed by the China Book Company.</p>
<h3>A New World in the Drama Circle - The Chinese Drama Club</h3>
<p>Recently, more than 20 people who are engaged in drama work have united to concentrate their efforts on launching and preparing a drama club. In order to provide a suitable place for talents who study drama to connect their feelings and discuss academics, so as to have new contributions, after this, the dramas that wander on the streets and are lonely in the pavilion rooms can get a tribe of belonging. It is heard that its main work is to vigorously promote the Chinese drama movement with the construction of theory and the development of skills, so as to achieve the status of the drama career in the society, and will start from the union of individuals and step forward to a very solid fortress.</p>
