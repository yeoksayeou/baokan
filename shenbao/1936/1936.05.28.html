<h3 id="c17">最近英意關係的分析 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>意大利宣布吞併阿比西尼亞後的重要工作一方面是怎樣去開發新獲得的土地一方面是怎樣去終止日內瓦的經濟制裁使各國承認其侵略戰爭所造成的事實前者爲意國的國內問題可以從容籌擬後者則爲意國現在所急需解决的問題因爲經濟制裁的繼續與國際關係的惡化實於意國的地位有重大的妨碍而日內瓦經濟制裁的實施表面上雖由國聯會五十餘個會員國實行實際上則全爲英國所發動與支持所以意大利要想改善它的國際關係從極端孤立的地位中提拔出來第一就須調整其對英國的關係最近墨索里尼採取怎樣的政策去改善英意的關係那是很値得注意的</p>
<p>意國現在的對英外交可說是採用軟硬兼施的方法卽一方面極力威脅英國在非洲與近東一帶的利益一方則直接的或間接的表示願與英國開始談判保障它的旣得利益意國是想用這種並行不悖的方法使英國就範改變其反意的態度意國的强硬外交方式我們可以用下列幾點來蹬明　對於英國由英法意三國協定所得之查那湖水源的利益意國表示不願保障這在法西斯機關報意大利日報上名記者蓋達氏曾有專文詳論此事　當意軍進佔阿京後新任阿比西尼亞總督鮑特格里奧上將曾間接表示不承認英法等國駐阿使領人員的地位而僅當作上賓看待後來又要求英國撤退其駐阿使館中的印兵一中隊　在近東的英國殖民地中從事煽動反英運動的爆發在最近巴勒期坦阿拉伯入的反英運動中意國更有乘機煽動的情形在巴勒斯坦與印度二地意國復建立廣播無綫電台以當地土語宣傳反英運動此外如表示在下月中國聯若不撤消對意制裁意國卽將宣布退出也是一種威脅的手段至於它所採的軟法則有以下事實　黑衫首相於二十日接見法國剛毅報記者時聲稱他對英國無所要求而願準備給予英國以各種可能的保障　意國駐英大使格蘭第於二十一日往見英國外次汪西泰據哈瓦斯社所得消息此次會見之目的有二一爲英意二國簽訂協定將意相所提供的諾言卽對於英帝國之埃及蘇丹及近東之利益意國均不予以威脅一層列入條文二爲訂立地中海協定煮國這種一硬一軟之外交策的目的無非欲使英國爲着其本身旣得的利益着想而放棄其反意的態度</p>
<p>那末英國對於意國是取怎樣的態度呢英政府中一般實利主義者鑒於意國已經吞併阿比西尼亞現在要想從慕索里尼的口中分嘗一杯羹是絕對不可能的於是頗主張與意國妥協改善英意的關係藉以獲得意國對於英國在近東一帶旣得利益的保障不過英國大部民衆現在仍堅持加緊對意制裁因此英國的對意態度一時恐不會有很大的轉變卽使英國政府在以後數月中將改變其對意態度但這也並不能表明英意二大帝國主義者的利益已經完全獲得妥協的解决英國之所以出此祇不過因爲環境關係暫時與意妥協而一面還是積極擴張軍備（如四萬噸海艦的保留與南非開浦鎭港的闢爲海軍根據地）充足實力以待機會之來臨那麽英意關係的前途也就可想而知了</p>

<p>天津通信、中央新頒華北緝私條例、津海關已先後奉到、惟以實行上窒礙殊多、並因須鐵路機關之協助、津浦路由鐵道部直接令飭車站設稅卡、沿錢設稽查處、關員登車檢查旅客、皆無問題、只北寗路局受外力壓迫、顧慮較多、不肯卽遵照部令去辦、外交方面、冀察政委會、前令蕭振瀛負責、與日方洽商、日方軍部與日領館表示、一致着眼於關稅减低、須另締華北特惠關稅條例、則走私者無利可圖、不緝自絕、蕭曾將此意轉詳於財部·及冀察政委會、但中央已間接明白宣示减低關稅、爲不可能之事、故在外交上言、目前殊不得解决方法、北寗路局、遂亦以此爲藉口、推諉延宕、意在迴避、津關稅務司許禮亞·緝私稅司斯普、日來迭與海關監督林世則·及北寗路局代表接洽、欲就中央新法中、研究一和平妥當之道、結果、仍未獲得何種新决定、北寗路局因海關迭次催促、始分向鐵道部·暨察政委會請示、俟覆訓到後、再作計較、然此又非當局有權爲堅决　决之時、回訓終將不到、北寗路局亦終將不爲切實協助、海關因嚴厲緝私困難　目前惟就一己範圍內、加以整飭、日前特通飭關員、不得疏於職守、或勾結浪人、包庇私運、否則查覺時、嚴重懲處、是雖近於虛文、第在此時、亦頗需要、</p>
<p>近數月來、因私糖運米過多、國糖銷路、殆全被奪、向來國糖在津、分閩·潮·汕·一帮、共設躉銷莊百餘家、每年春秋來貨最旺、由太古　怡和·招商局·三帮船隻運來、察·綏·晉·三省銷貨、亦以津爲轉輸口、每年來貨約五千餘萬包、今春迄今　寖成有行無市狀况、統計來貨五十萬包不足、過去每包一百斤、售洋十八元、現售十元、雖落價八元之鉅、仍鮮問津者、私糖百斤頃售五元、以之相較、國糖價高出一倍　購求者自然捨此就彼、故自三月份迄今、百餘家躉銷莊、倒閉七十餘家、僅餘三十餘家勉强支持、顧亦紛電閩潮汕本莊、停上來貨、設使走私繼續如此猖獗、不逾三月、卽此三十餘家、恐亦無力維持矣、</p>
<p>據海關調查、走私人造絲以二月份至四月下旬、輸入最多、共運來達四百七八十萬件、五月輸入爲少、約入白五十萬件、總計三個月內輸來、約六百三十萬件、其銷出之數、平均　四月、計魯省周村五十萬至六十萬件、冀省高陽三十萬件、天津當地三十萬至四十萬件、北平及其近郊約五萬至十萬件、上海二萬零千件、兩個月合計　共銷去　百二十萬件、殘餘約三白萬件、若以前數推算、存貨尙可足銷　月、目前爲人造絲銷塲淡月、如要完全銷罄、約在七月末、所以各貨堆存在津、一時不能脫售、走私者、遂不得不改圖另謀、石油輸來日多、銷路旺盛、卽其一證、聞半月中、　自僞冀東運到津二萬箱、南大寺·北戴河·猶存六千箱　每箱到津售價由六元餘　漲至七元二角、較美孚·亞細亞·媒油賤一元餘、來貨隨到隨銷、頗有求過於供之勢、大連煤油　箱、售價三元七角、私貨加入運費、到津成本爲四元八角、凈利一元四角餘、私運者不絕於途、同時英美油商、亦以此戚覺最大恐慌也、</p>
<p>據航業界消息、自本年三月後、私貨輸運旺盛、正當航商、均蒙影響、因浪人貨物、多由民船或汽船裝運、　時則自日船運輸、往來營口·大連·安東一綫國人經營商船、不得不减船班、以期少受損失、而營津航綫、復受僞滿限制、駛住營口船隻、非在僞交通部註冊、認有滿洲國籍不可、否則祇准裝正當货物、卽旅客亦不許載、今歲出關旅客、多於往年、客運水脚甚厚、國人商船、滿擬恃此挹注、詎竟受限制、營業前途殊堪憂慮也、（二十五日）</p>

<p>一·建設應該合於中國的國情、中國現在的國情怎麼樣、諒各位都已知道了、現在的中國、是一個窮的國家、但是地大物博、蘊藏豐富、明明如同一個很好的寶庫、不過沒有拿鑰匙來開這個寶庫就是了、所以可以說中國是窮而不窮、同時也是一個弱的國家、但要是中國四萬萬人、能夠團結一致、則衆志成城、亦可以成爲世界上強大的民族、故又可以說中國是弱而不弱、不過現在過渡時期中、我們打算把國家建設起來、使他復其本元、不能不對症下藥、一切的建設、第一、先要使他合乎本國的國情、不然、我們從外國舉來的東西很多、如果樣樣都依外國的成規、照樣建設起來、而不顧到自己的財力如何、即未免與國家的環境不甚適合、而與救國的題目、亦未免離得太遠了、</p>
<p>二·建設應該合乎現在的需要、一個國家的建設、千頭萬緒、尤其在中國產業落後的時候、爲合乎國情、必須預定一個整個的計畫、在建設的時候、於先後緩急之間、不得不權衡輕重、定一次序、譬如我們看見洋樓、很覺壯觀、但一家五口、却造了二十人住的洋樓、這就是不切乎實際的需要了、從前兄弟在日本的時候、在日本東京車站上看到所蓋的雨棚、簡陋非常、上面僅是一張洋鐵、下面不過是幾根粗木、然而遇着大雨、則一樣可以遮雨、雖然花錢不多、而總是自己的、反觀我國、我們到了北平、一到東站，看見很偉大的雨棚、雖覺得非常氣概、但是化錢很多、而且都借自外國、所以結果鐵路所賺進的錢、惟有還債、而不能拿來做發展改良的用塲、在中國過去的期間、這種種情形、不知多少、所以兄弟覺得這一點、在工程方面的人、尤其應該注意的三·建設應該合乎自己的力量、向來中國的學者、往往讀了死書、拘泥不化、現在的留學生、也不免犯了這個毛病、在外國學的甚麼、返國後、便整個的用了起來、一切的材料、都向外國去買、不要說、每年的漏巵很大、而中國原有的原料、不加以研究利用、亦是非常的可惜、現在建設須儘量蒐求國內的原料、不但可以合乎國家經濟原則、並且可以得到實際的用途、譬如中國以前所用的菜油燈、光熖很小、後經改良、以煤油點燈、則光熖加大月亮、但是煤油燈的玻璃罩、偶不經意、便容易打碎、於是經濟的人家、便不用燈罩、因此山西有些窮的人家、用沒有玻璃罩的燈很多、到後來因受煤油毒而發生胯瘡的人、亦就很多、經過醫生的研究、才發現出來、所以兄弟在工商部時、曾和他們技術人員說、要他們研究改造用玻璃罩的菜油燈、不但可以使利權不致外溢、且與身體也無妨害、後來果然被鍾　蕭賀昌兩君、經過　度的試騐、居然試騐成功了、幾個月前、由蕭君拿來給兄弟看、兄弟看了、光亮很好、非常高興、這對於社會也很有多少的貢獻、又如中國的藥材、自有他特長之處、不過在吃的時候、連渣也呑下去、在這些地方、如能加以研究、加以改良、把渣提出、鍊成精華、與外國藥同是　樣精良、不但可以救治生病的人、並可以維持許多採　賣藥人的生活、更可减少許多漏巵、譬如麻黃素·大蒜精·爲外國人所稱道、而樂於採用、據兄弟看來科學只有古今、並無中外、只要我個能參合新舊融會貫通、必可以有偉大的發明、今天五個學術團體、能聯合舉行年會、兄弟覺得這是個很好的現象、因爲中國人素來自顧自、各歸各、尤其在學術方面、有甚麼系、有甚麼派、自古以來、學術團體、不是互相攻訐、便是交相指摘、而在今天有中國化學工程學會，中國電機工程畢會·等團體、能聯絡一起、相親相愛、互相切磋、這是我們中國學術上一個很好的現象、本來做事、必彼此合作、聯合一貫、還才可以收到極好的效果、譬如藍、所房屋、工程師打樣·衛生工程師設置衛生設備·土木工程師集料徵工、互相合作、這所房子、才可以蓋得起、不過中國人素來是缺乏這種合作的精神、今天兄弟看到這一種良好的精神、實使兄弟即覺得非常的欣慰、希望諸君、繼續努力、繼續探求、向發明的路上一致前進、兄弟又覺得取人之長、去己之短、也未始不可、加中國數十年以　所發明的、現在雖已不甚適用了、但能取人之長處、　己之短處、努力改良、這也是我們應取的途徑、我們把人家的東西研究以後、加以仿造、雖不能迎頭趕上人家、但也可以和人家並駕齊驅、日本是最能仿造的國家、現在我們看日本所發明的東西、也許有勝過歐美的、歐美所沒有的東西、也許在日本發明了、美國是一個科學發達的國家、而在一角或二角的商舖中、日本貨是常見的、又如印度是英之殖民地、而日本紗布、竟能暢銷於印度、再如英之蘭開夏·孟却期德·爲英國紗業中心、而紗廠工人所穿的外衣、有人說亦是日本貨、是不是確實、雖沒曾看見、但據報告、確有此種情形的、我們試問、日本能有如此長足的進步、是從那兒來的　、就是從仿造來的、能仿造人家而推進陳出新、才使日本工業有如此長足的進步、所以兄弟覺得中國雖不能發明許多東西、但也可以把人家發明的東西、能加以研究、能加以仿造除了彷造以外、還須加以改良、「工欲善其事、必先利其器」、兄弟在長實業部的時候、曾計劃試辦一中央機器廠、預備改良中國手工業的機器，使中國家庭中的婦女、能利用此種改良的東西、來發展中國的家庭工業、想今天在坐諸位、必抱有像兄弟同樣的感想、很希望大家儘量去努力、因爲建設事業、無非是從農工商業來着手、現在我國出口貨物、日見减少、進口貨物、日見增加、連年入超甚巨、致陷國家於窮困之境、現在大家要想建設、就須設法救濟農工商業、要想救渣農工商業、必須减少入超、增加出超、兄弟就剛才所說的幾點觀察起來、不能不有所希望的三點、就是除了發明以外、還希望對於進口貨物多多仿造、對於出口貨物、多多改良、則我國的原料、自可得其利用、我國對外貿易、自可逐漸發展、同時並須注意財力物力的愛惜、一切使他合於經濟原則、則裨益於國計民生、實不可以道里計、兄弟嘗說、救國不一定要在政治方面做官、才救得國家、其實與國家最關切最重要的、不是官吏而是發明家、如各位同時能潛心於國防上種種利器的發明、在這目前國家危急的情勢中、尤有很大的需要、尤有很大的助力、環顧世界各國、軍事利器、日新月異、這都是科學家殫精竭慮、埋頭苦思的結果、而在中國、則尙無所聞、所以今天兄弟特再提出這點、請各位多多注意、不要讓那發明後膛槍的齊魯士人、專美於前、但是發明一定要有相當知識的人、才能收到效果、在中國四萬萬人之中、只希望今天在座諸君、因爲旣有相當學識、又有相當經騐、在社會上又有相當地位、要是大家能够一致堅定我們的意志、抱着苦幹硬幹實幹的精神、兄弟以爲對於國家必有極偉大的貢獻、所以兄弟今天在百忙之中、抽暇來參加盛會、貢獻這幾點意思、希望大家加以注意、雖然、兄弟隨便說來、但完全出於誠意、希望大家能够接受、能够實行、這就是對於我們目前國家民族的一個很大的帮助、也就是此次貴會開會最大的使命、</p>

<p>葉在獄曾吞鎖匙銅紐自殺奈均不死　對殺害日兵案因受若不堪只得屈認　—法官判令將葉送工部局醫院治病—</p>
<p>日本駐滬海軍艦隊兵士中山秀雄被槍狙擊殞命、經本市當局懸賞緝兇、事已半載、近由公共租界捕房陸續拘獲粵人葉海生（純號小廣東）·楊文道·周社榮·三名、以殺人罪提起公訴、迭經第一特區地方法院組織合議庭審理、除楊·周·兩被吿迄未供認外、葉海生雖屢次自白該水兵由彼槍殺、但供詞離奇、承審官爲鄭重起見、特由蕭燮棻推事、於上星期五命捕房押解葉海生並約同工部局律師暨被吿辯護律師、親赴</p>
<p>出事地點</p>
<p>之虹口賓樂安路一帶履勘、且令葉表演當日開槍情狀、以期求得眞相、昨日午後二時、仍由錢鴻業庭長會同蕭·馮·兩推事開庭續審、檢察官張宗儒亦蒞庭執行職務、市政府·市公安局·與日軍司令部、仍派秘書·科長·武裝軍官士兵·相繼到庭觀審、此外旁聽者、因法院限制綦嚴、未容任意出入、故僅有數十人、庭內尙不覺擁擠、惟被告葉海生形容</p>
<p>益見瘦弱</p>
<p>被探捕連同楊文道·周社榮·解至法庭、木立被吿根後、大有委靡不振之勢、當由法院指定爲葉辯護之張志讓律師、請求准其於末開始審問之前、將日前相隨推事履勘結果、對於捕房在出事處所獲子彈手槍之疑問兩點、加以陳述、庭上頷之、張律師遂謂捕房以該粒子彌、卽係擊斃日水兵者、但是日葉海生表演開槍情形、死者由南住北、葉則隨之、槍彈從</p>
<p>日兵後腦</p>
<p>射入、貫穿前額、日兵傷倒、子彈應落於倒地者之前面、然是彈竟係發現於背後、而被六十一號日捕檢得、倘檢彈地點與日兵所倒處前後未會錯誤、則此彈似與日兵被殺毫無關係、蓋未有彈經擊穿頭顱而其彈復自前飛回、方始落地也、西捕前亦供明日兵係倒於豐樂里稍南、更與發現子彈及彈壳之方向、不盡符合、此爲關於</p>
<p>子彈疑點</p>
<p>至手槍一支、前據捕房調查、係從豐樂里巡捕亭子底下檢獲、而是日葉海生亦將棄槍逃逸情形表演、倘其所表演之情狀、與當時之事實錯誤、則其言誠不足信、若該槍確從亭子底下檢得、殊非倉皇奔逃時所能如斯拋棄、緣槍係發現於亭子底下、須用木棒撥之使出、頗類於從容藏置者、若係任意拋棄、焉能如次妥貼、然棄其時逃亡不暇、自難從容安置、由斯推測槍亦與</p>
<p>是案無關</p>
<p>他如在楊文道家搜獲之書籍、更屬等而下之、殊不相涉矣、敝律師自奉委爲被告辯護後、會依法投捕房接見被告、詢問一切、當時由日捕等將葉自監所帶入一小室、卽吿葉以訪晤之意、並詰問其犯案之事實、葉初謂彼全不知、並求爲調查、我乃詰以旣不知情、曷自供認、葉愀然曰、彼願速死、且希望死後變爲厲鬼、俾可對陷害彼者復仇、我因曉以</p>
<p>鬼屬虛無</p>
<p>勿萌此念、並勸慰至再、葉乃凄然自言、被拘禁以來、業已兩度潛吞衣褲所綴銅鈕、奈均不死、彼有腹瀉之疾、或者所服銅物、已經排洩等語、現其身體已極衰弱、神經顯已變態、最爲表現者、卽迭次庭訊、彼所供之詞、先後不符、雖每次承認、然都屬遷就事實之語、凡與彼不利者、彼則承認不遑、而與彼有利者、反矢口否認之、設發見所言或與事實不符、更多方自圓其說、揣其意</p>
<p>在求速死</p>
<p>是彼所供、尙堪置信耶、當蕭推事履勘之際、彼忽口呼救命、此種情形、庭上當早洞鑒、但彼一面供認、一面呼寃、益徵其神經衰頹、誠有醫治之必要、故請求移送醫院、以便療治云云、並將所繪出事處地名一幅呈案、將是日履勘時、葉在某處如何表演、日水兵傷倒某處　及手槍子彈在某處檢獲、葉逃逸經過之路錢、逐一指明、按圖備述、尤爲詳盡、而葉則時而蹙額長吁、時而</p>
<p>鳴咽飮泣</p>
<p>捕房律師汝葆彝於張律師言已、卽起而聲明、子彈落地之處、實在倒地者之前面、而捕房至今猶未嘗主張槍彈係從後腦射入貫穿前額、實係由旁側透出、且此項槍彈、業經專家騐明、若與是案果無關係、又何致據以起訴、張律師因復稱、但據日籍醫生於五月六日到庭證明死者係被槍彈自後腦射入，由前面透出、庭上遂傳工部局檢騐槍械西員到庭、訊以檢騐該項槍彈之經過據稱、渠曾將此槍、</p>
<p>試放十次</p>
<p>、中有一次之彈射出後、保向後飛至十八尺之遙、方始落地、至於檢獲之子彈、因已經過多數之手續、縱或當時留有血漬、亦必消滅、决難斷定云云、又由狄思威路捕房西副探長報吿出事時、除前已傳案之證人外、尙查有浦朝英者、亦曾目覩、浦在捕房前述證言、復與日醫證言及檢騐槍彈等報吿符合、庭上乃命書記官丁重南將履勘時所記之筆錄</p>
<p>朗誦一過</p>
<p>、張律師卽於其尾書「大致相符」四字、旋傳月宮飯店茶房任姓到案、讀以曾否認識葉·楊·周三人、任供九號房間、係夏春記所開、出入者衆、葉等三名、均未見過、更不相識等語、錢庭長遂向葉海生訊問、而先詰以每次提審、旣自供認行兇、又復哭泣、或呼寃枉之故、葉乃泣稱、我今祗二十八歲、尙屬有爲靑年、但已因此案在捕房潛吞鎖匙兩枚、所服西裝衣背上銅片一塊、及褲上銅紐、以冀自盡、實因</p>
<p>苦痛難受</p>
<p>故出此舉、而供認亦係由此、俾此案得以速了、實則日兵非我打死、且其時我方籌備爲老母於十一月十二日慶壽之事、當十一月七·八·九·等日、正在忙發請帖、由張財源代爲向大中華酒館預定酒席、倘果係我將日兵打死、事後何猶不逃、更有何興爲我老母祝　、總之上有靑天、下有審判長、此案絕對非我幹的、我自去年九月自靑島返滬、日往月宮飯店九號房間、請帖亦在</p>
<p>該室書發</p>
<p>儘可調查、惟今日到庭之茶房、則從未見過、庭稱因爲時已久、當日所聚首之人、如夏春記等大都星散、現祇張財源知之、庭上卽誌以以前何故供認行兇、葉更淚落如珠、隨發慘聲「唉」、繼而曰實遭人陷害、被拘押後、又不堪種釋苦痛、惟有屈認、以求一死、今請審判長早賜判决、言已</p>
<p>哭竟失聲</p>
<p>庭上遂轉訊楊文道供、廿二年十一二月間曾去粵，次年十一月十三日返申、在粵未任公安局長、而滬公安局亦無緝拏之事、與葉尙係在洪順會時相識、我家此次搜出藏置手槍之書、實係楊建中栽害、因我昔年備一手槍、恐被小孩携取肇事、建中乃敎我將書挖洞而藏之、今年二月間、彼來我家、適此書在孩手、我則上樓取烟、及下樓孩已</p>
<p>出外遊戲</p>
<p>、必係建中乘我登樓之隙、另以彼書易去我書、迨我被捕、家內搜出此書、我猶以爲原書、故第一次卽當庭承認、嗣後詳察、始悉並非原書云、末由張財源蹬明、葉於十一月十號在大中華酒館爲其母做壽請客屬實、並稱日水兵被殺之夜、彼確見葉開槍後逃逸、錢庭長訊至此、諭葉卽送工部局醫院、並派法醫協同洽療、楊·周·兩被吿帶還捕房、侯下星期三下午續訊、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、近兩三日來本埠氣溫激落、上星期五日爲七九度七、本星期二日最高僅六十六度、據徐家匯天文台稱、五月間上海氣候若是之凉、爲多年來所未有、其故由於本區天空氣壓高逾尋常、空氣上升、而西比利亞之風乃乘隙由西北侵入、在往年此時、西比利亞之空氣輒向東進、本年因中國氣壓、乃轉向東南進、至於氣壓曷爲逾尋常、則不能言其故、而不欲歸咎於太陽之黑點或其他同樣之現象、天文台會將本年五月一日至二十六日之氣溫與上年同時相較、本年二十六日中平均最大度爲七十度弱、上年則爲八十五度、相差十五度有奇、亦足徵本年五月中氣溫之反常矣、該台且料今後溫度之增高、將逐漸而來、不致　變、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之廿六）</p>
<p>（四）油漆之種類　油漆種類隨功用而異，有護金，護木，護土之別，因名目繁多，且有容量及形色之不同，非熟於此道者，難以諳識，茲摘要如次：</p>
<p>漆　分白色有色兩種，白色分四A，三A（或稱特上上），雙A，A，B，C，六級，有色分三A，雙A，A一級，以四A貨最優，順序而下。房屋，輪船，鐵道需用頗廣，灰色油漆銷路尤暢，BC級貨質低劣，僅作頭塗（即打底漆）之用，以喊爲單位，每喊分裝四小鐵箱，每箱容量二十八磅。</p>
<p>調合漆　分有光無光兩種，等級有三A，雙A之別，用於上等本器及廣告脾等，以介侖計算，除五介侖盛裝鐵箱外，其餘一介侖，半介侖，二·五介侖，均用印花鐵罐。</p>
<p>磁漆　功效與凡立水相仿，塗飾木鐵各器，均所宜用，裝印花小圓罐，有一磅半磅之別。</p>
<p>鉛丹防銹漆　專供屋頂，橋梁，輪船及鐵器上之用，有防銹之功效，故名。以桶爲計算單位，每桶容量爲五十六磅。</p>
<p>凡立水　以樹膠類溶爲液體而成，塗於物體表面，乾燥後即生光輝，故椅桌木材，白鐵罐頭，商標等物多用之。因所採原料之不同，有分琥珀假漆，箇拔爾假漆，台姆瑪假漆，珊達刺屈假漆，賣司替克假漆等名稱。</p>
<p>（五）油漆之營業　油漆營業以春秋爲旺月，夏冬爲淡月，共營業之進退，繫於產業之興簪。年來地產衰落，建築呆滯，該業遂難以發展。全年各廠營業額，多則八十餘萬元，少僅十餘萬元。銷貨方法皆設代理處經售，酬勞都給佣金。各經理人在各埠　有代辦八，倘需貨時，隨即可向廠方直接採辦，貨欵運裝後付淸。南洋羣島一帶，亦有經理處。如新加坡之振和，八打威之英華，三賓之華豐泰，均爲上海油漆之推銷處。消費油漆最大之船塢鐵道等，採辦方法設投標制，頗引起業中人競爭。營造廠所需者，泰半由五金店轉手，鮮有直接交易。外商在滬營油漆者，有久記，萱葺，吉星，紅手，恒大，美和，瑞祥洋行等，而以吉星範圍最大，每年營業達百萬元。本埠各徽漆號，均有代售。據二十四年度調查，華商七家油漆廠，銷貨油漆約二二·六八四，一二三磅，凡立水約三〇一·六四一介侖。至歷年來之營業指數，則有如下表（以民國十九年爲基數）：</p>
<p>（六）油漆之銷路及進口　油漆銷路偏重於都市，窮鄉僻邑應用殊少。上海爲通商大埠，大夏林立，需用最繁，且以高貨爲尙。但以種種關係，國貨銷數尙不及外貨，惟漢口，四川，靑島，福建，廣東，等處國產油漆，尙能佔相當優勞。據專家估計，上海之油漆銷數，國貨與外貨爲三比七，其在國內各埠適得其反。東北三省原爲油漆繁銷之區，九一八後，則已銷聲匿跡。南洋一帶爲我國油漆唯一之輸出地，近亦受日貨傾銷影響，頗形不振。</p>
<p>外貨油漆進口，年約關金百萬元。英貨輸入最繁，美國次之，日本又次之。以輸入種類言，英國多厚漆，美國多凡立水，日本多磁漆。就二十四年度論，輸入總額爲八十一萬七千七百七十七海關金單位，其中英貨占二十一萬三千五百九十一，美貨占十八萬六千八百六十三，日貨占十萬。三千五百四十五。輸人口岸則以上海天津廣州最多，二十四年度運上海者凡五十五萬一千二百七十三海關金單位，輸入天津者凡七萬一千四百九十三海關金單位，輸人廣州者凡四萬○九百〇七海關金單位。茲將近二年來輸入價値列下，（單位海關金）：</p>

<p>百公尺趙秉衡第一</p>
<p>百公尺最先舉行、劉長春困足疾尙待休、致未出塲、參加者世運訓練班爲趙秉衡·符保盧、平代表則爲閻兆申楊海鵬王强、共五人起步、閻兆申一步當先、二十公尺前、趙秉衡獨殿於後、三十公尺趙便衝出、領導於前、一氣呵成、抵終點時、距閻約一公尺許、成績爲十一秒一、按趙秉衡起碼稍遲、最後衝刺亦嫌稍弱、如胸部前挺、均待努力、惟其速度確可步伍劉長春、奔馳擺動、均臻佳妙、倘能於起碼終點再加研究、四十秒七八之成績、不難獲得、閻兆申原名閻承天、在津與韓景林楊伯仲、雖曰後　、亦屬可造之　、</p>
<p>二百公尺　　冠軍</p>
<p>二百公尺四時開賽、參加者三人、跑程係直綫，趙秉衡因百公尺賽罷、稍感疲乏、故未參加、由戴淑國客串、（戴原專致力於四百公尺）戴於起跑亦被落後、四十公尺左右、戴則已衝前二步、餘子望塵莫及、追隨於後、抵終點時、距第　名約四尺公、按小戴身軀稍　、其練四百公尺似有未宜、惟觀其二百公尺上身擺動、尙有未合、故於成績略有影響、但其跑二百公尺終屬客串、故吾人亦不便苛求、</p>
<p>四百公尺兩人競賽　四百公尺參加者共有二人、世運訓練班爲李世明、平市代表則爲張應龍、惜戴淑國未能同時與賽、殊爲可惜、五十公尺後、李即前導約七八公尺、抵終點時、成績爲五十三秒三、第二名張應龍、爲五十七秒六、按李第一階叚、跑法尙佳、其小腿動作、尚未臻完善、其挺腰程度亦待訓練、</p>
<p>千五百公尺破全國</p>
<p>千五百公尺於三時起始，只賈連仁杜化居二人參加、杜化居始則追隨賈後約二公尺、四百公尺旣竟、杜漸不支、落後約十餘公尺、賈則再接再勵、奔馳自如、至千一百公尺行程、賈在杜前約百公尺、時爲三分七秒、無何、全程將竟、賈於最後白餘公尺、猶加緊速度、利用最後術刺、其成績爲四分二十秒、雖略遜於前者所造之四分十三秒之成績、然已打破全國紀錄矣、第二名杜化居之成績、則爲四分五十三秒、賈與賽罷、神色如常、無力竭之表現、已屬難能、觀其魁梧堅實之體格、殊不類爲一中距離健兒、</p>
<p>高欄　紹洲　全國</p>
<p>百十公尺高欄，林紹洲黃英傺楊道崇等三人參加、於二時餘、繼白公尺後競賽、林黃成績伯仲、競爭亦烈、極爲可觀、最初三人平行、至第三欄、楊道崇已落後約一公尺、林黃難分軒輊、相差幾希、全程旣竟、林黃相隔只一肩、成績爲十六秒、按林紹洲高欄姿式甚佳、惟下關時、腰部灣曲、尙稍欠缺、黃越欄雖差、其速度則尙可取、</p>
<p>千六接力北平落後</p>
<p>千六百公尺接力、訓練班選手爲賈連仁·董翰文·李世明·戴淑國等、平代表則爲吳斌·張繼明·杜化居·閻兆申等、第一棒賈連仁卽越前達二十餘公尺、第二棒進展尙少、第三棒平代表已落後　達百餘公尺、第四棒　爲戴淑國持棒急馳、迨抵紅綫、距平代表約百五十公尺、成績爲五分一秒、（按）訓練班選手接棒工夫尙差、倘能以劉長春代董翰文、則成繢當更有可觀、蓋董現已久不致力於四百公尺也、</p>
<p>田賽速寫</p>
<p>陳寶球二次破遠東</p>
<p>此項參加者有訓練班之陳寳球·郭潔·及平代表田景堯·崔祥康、每人擲六次、陳寳球初擲時、成績爲十二公尺、郭潔僅十公尺、田景堯九公尺、崔祥康退居其後、再度投擲時　田景堯壓倒郭潔、陳寳球已達十二公尺九八、最　鐵牛振臂一呼、竟以十三公尺二六、打破遠東紀錄、（按）遠東是項保持者爲日人阿部功、成績十二公尺九〇五、田景堯爲十一公尺四一、郭潔十一公尺三、崔祥康爲十公尺六四、又陳氏　一次破遠東在淸華末次測騐、</p>
<p>標槍彭永馨平全國</p>
<p>大彭因在淸華測齡失敗、即臥薪嘗膽、刻苦自勵、日前又在春運會上失敗、猶予以一針興奮劑、二十五日天氣旣好、又無　旁風　阻撓、所以大可以從容施展威風、周長星亦不示弱、緊緊相隨、彭在第三擲時、即造成平全　五〇·五六公尺之成績、長星成績四九·六五公尺、居第二、第三與第四係李世明與平市畢華軒、</p>

<p>— 果軒</p>
<p>汽車發明家</p>
<p>誰都看見過大汽車公司玻璃窗裏陳列的那些漂亮的汽車吧？什麼「林肯賽飛」呀，「司蒂倍克」呀，「別克」呀……走在柏油馬路上，只聽見刷的一聲就過去了，那神氣眞是十足；就是沒錢的窮光蛋，不也曾坐過像裝罐頭一般塞滿了人的長途汽車或公共汽車麼？那塵土的飛揚，汽油的臭味，的確很使人難過，但是從先坐騾車或騎驢子要走兩三天的路程，今日半天就到了，這給我們多少便利呢？尤其是中國，鐵路既少，內地的交通，差不多全仗這個，現在各省公路統計起來快到十萬公里，每年從外國輸入的汽車何止値幾千萬元！汽車眞成交通要具了啊！</p>
<p>現在讓我講講汽車發明的故事：</p>
<p>很久以前，就有一個法國人想用機器的力量開車，但他沒有成功，只把計畫登在一本機械雜誌上，這雜誌被大西洋彼岸——美國一個靑年工人看見了，深深引起好奇心，於是努力硏究，費了差不多十年心思，碰了多少釘子，終於他造成功一部適用的汽車。</p>
<p>這靑年是誰？就是今日美國著名的汽車大王，亨利福特。</p>
<p>亨利·福特生於美國密軌安省的特羅市市外一個小村，他父親是個農夫，辛苦了一輩子，臨死時遺給他三千塊錢，但福特却自幼就喜歡玩弄機器。在學校時，他頂愛上勞作科的課程，所以他年歲一長，立刻投身的特羅市一家蒸汽機公司當學徒。他起初每星期掙二塊錢工資，美國生活程度是很高的，當然不够維持生活，於是他只好到一家珠寳店作夜工，每星期收入增至四元，生活才勉强能够混下去。這時他每天要做十五小時的工，實在疲乏不堪，但他　時時刻刻不忘記他的硏究工作，原來他正打算創一鐘表公司，預計每天能出二千隻鐘表，每隻工價三角七分，到市塲上售價四角，這樣廉價的出品，一定會受到歡迎，而他的事業也就可以發達起米；他的同伴多半笑他的妄想，以致雖有少數人　忙他，這個理想的公司到底沒有實現。不過福特却始終相信着一切東西如果大量生產，定會將成本减低，售價便宜，因而得到廣大的　塲。</p>
<p>因爲計畫不能實現，福特沮喪地回了家，休息了三年之久。</p>
<p>就在這時，他讀到那位法國人的文章，深深地引起他的好奇心，他想這種一機器車一如果作成，一定會大受歡迎，便利社會不小！於是從此專心於此種發明的研究。</p>
<p>幾十天後，他已作好初步製造的圖案，立即到的特雜去買材料。但在中途他忽然想到這種車如果象自行車一般只能用於一二人，還不算希奇，必須能載重致遠才好。於是他想如何使機器運轉更有力些，他就想到火車是用蒸汽發動，這種車最好也用燃燒的力量發動，美國是產煤油的，何不就用煤油來試騐一下呢？</p>
<p>從此以後，在家裏晝夜不停的研究起來，只因他對電學沒有高深的知識，以致使汽油揮發燃燒以發電的設備始終沒有弄好，好些親朋都勸他中止此項研究，以免荒廢所業。我們當然知道世界上任何大發明家都有堅忍不拔的毅力，福特也是一樣，所以他不但不聽從別人的勸告，反再到的特羅市學習電學。</p>
<p>他重新投身於電氣工廠，作夜工，月薪只有四十五元，一天這公司新買來一架機器，各工匠都不能開動他，只好將這偉大的東西棄置一邊，福特已在工廠工作五個月，各種機械，都有相當認識了，恰好他從此經過，一個工匠說。。「你能弄動他嗎？」福特說：「試試看吧！」於是他視察了各處構造，覺得並沒有什麼新奇，只要用脚踏一下，就會發動的，他便猛力一脚，果然機器立刻動起來，福特困此，頗受工廠信任。每月薪金增至百五十元。</p>
<p>他娶了妻，買了一座住宅，在住宅一旁建築起他自己的試騐窒，他更加努力的試騐起他的理想來了：每天下了工，就穿了油漬的工作服拿了鎚子鑽進他的試騐室，叮叮噹噹，晝夜不停。一切事情，原來怕專心的，他改良又改良，工作又工作，終於有一天他的理想快要實現了，這時已是深夜，他的妻幾次來儷促他睡眠，但他總是說：「不要忙，還差一點了！」於是鎚子又響起來、不覺漫漫長夜已經過去，朝陽又從東方升起了，但是，福特精心　製的第一部汽車，就在這時完成了，請想他那時的喜悅，將到如何程度啊！</p>
<p>吃了早飯，福特開了這輛奇奇怪怪的車出去了，道上的人，看了這種自己飛跑的怪物，都驚奇得呆了，福特只管得意的向前開去，但到要回來的時候，機器却不能迥轉了，福特急得滿頭大汗，路上觀衆見了，只得大家將車子給他挽回來，目然，少不得有人笑他，說他簡直在發神經病了。</p>
<p>從福特開始硏究製造汽車起，到這時候已竟整整八年光景，才有這樣的成績。雖則還沒有到澈底成功的時候，但福特已自覺有把握，因爲工廠裏事情太忙，不能抽出工夫來用於製造硏究，他便辭去工廠職務，專心來做他自己的事業。他依然想像他起初所　書那個鐘表公司似的，打算大規模的製造汽車，用廉價來銷售。他　即四出宣傳，招收股本，以爲這樣有利可圖的事業，一定會馬上有人出錢的，那知別人都以爲他的事業太冒險，終於沒有人肯拿出一文錢！</p>
<p>福特又失敗了！</p>
<p>這時有一個呌威英頓的人，也從事於汽車製造，不過他的車要比福特的車笨大些，其餘大致一樣。威英頓聽說福特已經成功，深恐這個賺錢生意爲福特所得，於是向福特要求汽車競賽。</p>
<p>福特答應了他的要求，定期比賽。那一天人山人海，都到比賽地點看新鮮把戲。威英頓的車旣高且大，福特的車又小又寒傖，光瞧着就不順眼，大家都覺得福特非失敗不可了；一聲號令，兩個怪車一齊馳騁起來，那消半里地光景，福特的車早已飛奔向前，把威因頓遠遠落在後面了。大家不由得喝起采來，福特受了極熱烈的歡迎。</p>
<p>福特滿想藉此機會，可以向商人們大大宣傳，以實現自己的計畫了，那知狡猾的商人，不到有實利可得的時候，他們是不肯掏腰包的所以福特的目的，依然不能達到。後來，幸而有一個名叫庫曾的商人，首先付錢向福特定購第一輛汽車，這事很鼓起福特的勇氣，恰好這時威英頓又要求賽車，福特就和庫曾駕車與賽，結果福特叉得了勝，威英頓只得甘拜下風，而努力的福特，從此運氣也就好起來。因了福特兩次的優勝和庫增的宣傳，全美國的商人，一齊向福特投資，於是公司成立了，顧特作總經理，月薪還是一百五十元。</p>
<p>但這公司不久就倒閉了，原因是股東想多賺錢、與福特意見衝突，福特旣沒有資本，又有老婆孩子要吃飯，這時生活極爲困難。幸而他的同志庫增和另外一位名威爾斯的，都破了產來帮助福特，福特只雇了兩個工人，自己也穿了工人衣服，一同做工。當時福特式汽車，旣已遠近聞名，故訂購者極爲踴躍，半年後，工人增至四十名，福特除維持家用外，並不多支薪水，因爲他那大量生產廉價銷售的目的還沒有達到，雖則他的汽車現在每輛只賣九百元，較別人所做的已經便宜二倍。</p>
<p>這年冬天，到了結賬的節日，只因當時市場不好，福特又碰到壞運氣，公司賠本，以致不能支持。到年節那一天，福特向工人痛哭流涕，說明破產的情况，並表示自己的計畫和希望，當時工人很受感動，竟願全體不拿工資，繼續維持下去。福特心裏。又是高興，又是懊喪。恰好這時歐洲大戰（德國和世界各國開戰）起了，汽車的需要大增，福特的營業大大興盛起來。後來，工人竟增加到一萬六千，福特因是工人出身，很曉得勞工的困苦，便首先施行八小時勞動制，打破美國各工廠的十小時勞動制。並給工人增加工資，最低每日工資五元，（合中國錢十七八元）世界各國工廠主人聽了無不驚詫，但福特的營業却只有日見發達。</p>
<p>這時福特已竟充分實現了他那大量生產廉價銷售的理想，他的辛苦，總算不白費了！</p>
<p>如今福特已成美國的大富豪，他的財產快到十萬萬金元，但他也的確給許多貧苦工人造了幸福。他的工場裏工人何止幾萬，作一輛汽車要經過七千八百八十二種手續，我們已可想像用人之多。他給工人設了醫院，學校以及種種衛生設備，並且每年盈利還給工人分紅。我們說福特不但造福於人類，使我們得到交通利器，且可說是一個偉大的社會革命家了！</p>

<p>他年幼的時候，就喜歡觀察天體。他相信我們的眼睛，看不見很遠的星，所以時時要想做一件工具，來窺破太空的秘密，果然，他得到一個極好的機會：當他八歲的時候，有一個人帶一隻望遠鏡，遊行到他的村中，他喜歡得了不得，立刻向這個人租來這隻望遠鏡，得以一窺天象·那時他覺得造化的奇妙，非得來個深切的認識不可。弄得他夜夜不願睡，仰着頭在村中踱來踱去，注意着天空排佈的星辰。他常常對人說：「當我長大的時候，我一定要習天文」。剛剛八歲的他，就存着替人類謀幸福的志趣，這是多麼値得我們注意呀！</p>
<p>可是他生於一個貧寒的家庭，沒有力量使他深造。中學畢業以後，他就在社會裏服務了·起先他當一個藝徒，三年後或爲一個稍有經騐的機匠。二十歲的時候，在辟茲堡一個鋼廠裏當一個下等機師，他消磨在煤烟和鐵屑裏的時間，足足有二十一年的光景·</p>
<p>他的生活情形，和我們窮中國的中國人比較一下，可以說是一樣的艱苦。然而他的精神，够使我們欽佩了。除工廠裏做工的時間外，他最密切的朋友便是舊的書籍和雜誌了。勤讀不倦，播下他爲人類謀幸福的種子。他尤其注意大空的現象，所以在晨出暮歸的電車中，也常常看窗外天空的景象，有時在午飯之後，集來一大堆的工友們在一起談天·在他們談話之中，他常常介紹他們天空的知識。他注重工人的敎育，也是這樣的熱心·</p>
<p>二十一歲的時候，他和一個名叫芙娥培的（Phoebe）結婚，她也是一個很學識的女子，所以他倆能够互相帮助研究，他的成功，實在得到她的帮助不少。他要蓋一座屋子，因爲他收入不多，不得不自已下手。所以工廠下工之後，他就回去帮助她蓋房子。他倆可噹了一年的光景，才把這座屋子蓋好。</p>
<p>她和他同居不久，就受他對於星象的關懷所渲染·他倆的願望，是要自己做一隻望遠鏡，所以他的屋子裏，漸漸變成一個小工廠·他所用的工具，大部份都是他親手造成的·從此他倆就開始磨造一塊　玻璃，日夜努力，這樣的做三年，才完放了望逮鏡中的玻璃片。眞的，雖然是一塊玻璃，要把牠磨成能够裝在望遠鏡上用的，不是一件容易的事情吓！因爲假使這片玻璃不是球面的或拋物錢的曲度，不能應用於觀察天體。假使在玻璃上畫了一絲微痕，觀察天體就受了極大的影響。他磨成這塊玻璃之後，即刻提往辟茲堡的天文台裏，去見蘭格萊氏，求他指示裝入窺管的方法。不久，他自製的望遠鏡成功了·在他的屋頂鑿成一個空洞，把這個望遠鏡伸出，吓！天空的渺茫，已經在他的掌握中了·三年的工程，完成於一旦，他倆是多麼快樂吓！那一天晚上，快樂制勝了疲乏和睡魔，他倆在這個鏡中，足足觀察了一個整夜。第二天，他請了許多的朋友，村民以及工友們，來同享窺測神秘的太空之樂·他的望遠鏡雖然簡陋，但是他的願望算是成功了。這隻鏡子的直徑只有五寸，牠所看的天空，還不能够滿足這位進取的科學家，所以他立意要再做一隻更大的。</p>
<p>後來他倆又磨成一面玻璃，直徑有十二寸這麼寬。時間又花了兩年。磨好之後，他要在這面玻璃上敷以一層薄銀，用以迴射强光·不幸得很，當他敷銀的時候，忽然這面玻璃破裂了。這一個重大的打擊，簡直把他打昏了。那天，他在工廠裹工作的時候，活像一隻獃子·下工以後，他回到他的家裏，屋子裏，廚房裏，都找不到芙娥培夫人，最終，他在他自己的工廠裏，發現她正在燒火·那時汽鍋裏的水正沸　着，在他的磨造玻璃的機器上，已經安好一塊新的玻璃了·她向他微笑，並且對他說：「我們不要灰心，只要再做一面，還要使牠比那面破的更好。」這句話，好像在將滅的火黃上澆了油，使這位科學家又鼓起他蓬蓬勃勃的勇氣來。果然，不久他倆又完成了一面更好的玻璃。</p>
<p>這隻十二寸徑的玻璃，和美洲各有名大學裏所用的差不多大·不過牠的功用還要大呢！他有空閑的時間，就在還隻鏡裏窺測太空的變象。這時候的報紙上，常常登載他的著作，他的成功，更受人注意了。</p>
<p>他在工廠寡服務二十一年，後來爲辟茲堡大學所聘，當一位天文敎授·吓！普通的一個機匠，能够躍升爲一個大學裏的敎授，這是多麼難得而且光榮的事吓！後來他還做辟茲堡大學的校長·這無非是他苦苦奮鬥的結果·從此他的天才更能充分發揮·同時他開設一所工廠，專門製造天文儀器·</p>
<p>美國有一個機師學會（American　Society　of　Mechanical　Engineers），這個學會是世界上著名的工程學會，他也當過這個學會的會長，並且他是一個最令人敬仰的會長。</p>
<p>磨造天體望遠鏡用的玻璃，成爲他的專門技術了·因爲玻璃的周圍愈大，或是直徑愈大，磨造的工程就愈難了·假使有一隻六尺徑，兩噸重的玻璃鏡頭，那幾乎是人工所不能辦得到的·現在威爾遜山巓的大文台的望遠鏡，（徑六尺，重愈兩噸）就是這位科學家苦鍊的結晶了。</p>
<p>科學上量長的單位，最普通要算是米突尺（Meter）了。但是一個米突究竟有多麼長呢？科學家要造一隻「標準的米突尺」勉强用鉑　錶的合金造成·可是在沒有造標準尺之先，一定要知道怎樣來决定標凖米突尺的長度。科學家要用光的波長來做標準。可是要計算一米突等於若干光的波長，必需要藉一面精確的鏡片，這面鏡是平面的，但是牠的「平」的程度，不可比理想的平面差一寸之百萬分之一（一〇寸）這就可難了。世界權量部（International　Bureau　of　Weigbt　and　Measure）徵求磨造這面玻璃，還是這位科學家當選，完成這塊玻璃的也就是他。</p>

<h3 id="c192">一年來的讀書運動 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 賀漢光</p>
<p>我國學術空氣之淺薄，爲任何人所不能否認。而國內文化團體之致力於這一方面工作的，也如鳳毛麟角，渺不可得。過去的一年中間，在獎勵讀書的一點上稍能下一番功夫的，祇有中國文化建設恊會所　導的讀書運動。</p>
<p>文建協會在去年　，曾發起全國讀書運動大會和全國讀書競進會。讀書運動大會的內容：一爲聯合全國各大出版機關，半價發售本版書籍：二爲敦請各學術　家，播送讀書指導的演　詞。成效若何，不得而知，不過在大會期間，久書局門庭若市的一點上觀察，因讀書運動而購書閱畫的人，或亦不在少數吧！</p>
<p>不過，這讀書運動大會到底比較空泛些，造成讀書風氣，或具相當力量，但收效若何，究竟難以測度。比較切實而有眞實成績表顯的，草過於讀書競進會。而且由於讀書競進會成績之是否優良，也可窺測中國一般靑年好學之程度是如何了。</p>
<p>在讀書競進會的辦法中，有幾點値得我們特別注意的，現在摘錄如下：</p>
<p>一·報名處—計有二十五處，爲滬，蘇，京，浙，皖，贛，鄂，湘，豫，平，冀，津，魯，陝，甘，靑，閩，川，滇，熱，綏，寧，晋，察，東北等各文建協會之分會。</p>
<p>二·報名手續—塡表兩張，二寸照相三張；路途遙遠者可通信報名；並不納費；且加入後，向各書局購書，可享受五折之優待。</p>
<p>三·獎勵金—大學組之第一名至第三十名，中學組之第一名至第三十名，均有現金或書籍之獎勵。</p>
<p>在這辦法中間，可謂相當完美，收利甚厚，而義務祇有讀書。可是舉辦的成績如何，在文建協會的統　報告中，可見一　：</p>
<p>報名會員——大學組三一二六人　中學組二六六三人</p>
<p>應試會員——大學組四六人　中學組七四人</p>
<p>最後成績——大學組八八·七一分　中學組九一·五分</p>
<p>最劣成績——大學組三八·八五分　中學組九·八三分</p>
<p>全國報名會員，大中學組共僅五千七百八十九人，已够令人驚異，而應試會員，大中學兩組，僅一百二十人，更使我們舌橋不能下，這裹面，雖然有種種特殊的原因在內，但好學之士的稀少，我們是不能不加以承認的。而最優成續與最劣成績之令人不能滿意，也毋容贅言了。</p>
<p>作者認爲這次交建恊會讀書競進會的工作，雖然成績不佳，但絲毫沒有浪費，而且得到了一個很大的事實敎訓，就是全國一般靑年，對於讀書是怎樣的漠視。那麼我們非但不能因讀書競進會成績之不佳而停止了我們的工作，更應該深信獎勵學術，提倡讀書，是中國目前唯一的急務！</p>
<h3 id="c193">中國古代經濟思想及制度 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 黃正之</p>
<p>田畸仁義著　王學文譯　商務出版</p>
<p>研究中國古代代經濟想思及制度，是一件非常艱苦的工作。它的研究的方法，不外乎由下列三種方法入手；一是根據了古代的史籍，加以整理分析的歸納，然後得到一個大　上的的概念。二是從發掘古物上着眼，用地質學上的種種方法，加以研究，加以推敲，發現一些古代一鱗半爪的事實，積年累月，當可得到一個正確的結論。三是參考了古代的史籍，加以抉擇，辨其眞僞，再將已發現的古物互相印證，互相比較，經過一番深刻的考察硏究以後，然後作一個假定的結論，以爲後人之賡續硏討。這三種方法，並不互相牴觸，正是相輔而相成，而且以硏究的事功關論，也同樣艱苦，同樣有成效。</p>
<p>不過國人之從事於此種硏究的，正如鳳毛麟角，渺不可得。在一部世界文化史上，關於中國的部份，直到現在還是一個疑問，這决不是中國學者之不長進，也是客觀的原因决定了的，政治的不安定，社會的不安定，獎勵學術工作之不推動，在在影響硏究工作之無法進行。在這裏，我們讀到了友邦人士田畸仁義先生的「中國古代經濟思想及制度」一書，眞應如何的慚愧啊！</p>
<p>學術工作固然是世界的，不分國界的，但是中國的事情中國人自己不加以硏究，而友邦學者反孜孜兀兀於此，我們倒底是不勝　劾與愧汗的。</p>
<p>田畸仁義先生之　中國經濟思想及制度」一書，他的硏究方法，正是筆者在上文所說的第一種硏究方法，是根據了古代的史籍加以整理分析和歸納的。不過他除掉以中國的古籍爲主要的研究材料以外，同時還以歐洲古代的史實加以對照，以資旁證。</p>
<p>在這一本書裏，著者努力硏究的一點，正如「結論」裏所說：「古今之世，原始民族之思想，率多以土地農業，象徵女性者，即在中國古代，亦復如此。例如以女性或陰性象徵土地與農業；復以祭祀此類神靈之方位塲所，採取女性陰性主義之方式。……且此種思想之特色，顯現於諸禮制之上，由土地農業所關之官制以至制度政策，無往不受其支配。凡硏究中國古代經濟史者，對於此種根本思想之不宜忽視，毋待贅言。……考察基此思想所生之封建組織及土地制度之發展，幾及本文之半。……」我們在這摘錄出來的幾句說話中，就可爲以道著者寫這本書的主要目的：一在中國古代經濟思想及制度組織上之特色——卽女性陰性主義——二在基此特色所生經濟上之組織及制度</p>
<p>爲了這兩點，著者是費了很大的勞力在這上面，而且還是一個假定的結論—當然不能說是定論，足證古代文化研究之不易，而很足以爲有志硏究古代文化者的一本重要參考書了。該書二十萬言，三四六頁，王學文譯，定價二元四角，商務出版。</p>
<p>衣食住行一樣的重要，而且有過之無不及，所以即使我國人民還够不上踏到憲政的階段，但是一般知識份子已急不及待地要求全民政治了。而中國國民黨也順應了這一個要求頒佈了中華民國憲法草案。</p>
<p>在這憲法草案裏，當然把中國民國的政治制度詳密地規定在這上面，到了十一月十二日舉行國民大會的時候，一經通過，這政治制度立刻實現，我們一般要求民治的國民，在這政治制度已草訂而尚未實行的現在，應該怎樣的予以研究和商討呢？</p>
<p>我們要研究政治制度，除掉根據　孫總理的主義學說，以及現在國民政府五院制實際的經騐以外，筆者以爲世界各國的政治制度尤應有深切的瞭解和研究的必要，人類的進步，由於不踏前人的歧途；過去及現在的事實，都是我們指路的明燈，那麼楊幼炯符彪兩先生合編的「各國政治制度」一書，實有鄭重地推蔫於讀者諸君的必要！</p>
<p>在這一本祇有十二萬言左右的書裏，質量之豐富，是値得我們異常驚異的。首先叙述各國的沿革；次述各國現在的政治機構，對各國國家之起源與盛衰遞嬗之過程；以及其整個的政治祖織，如立法行政司法等機關之機能與構成；政黨之本質與消長等；都加以扼要的說明，所以我們讀了這一本書後，對於各國之國情，政治制度變遷之因果，以及政治組織之現狀等，都可以有一個明晰的認識，有了這一個基本的認識以後，然後返顧中國的現狀，以及憲法草案上之規定，我們非但可得一比較的觀察，而且可以得到評驚其是非的正確的結論來，祇須你對於政治經濟略有基礎的話。</p>
<p>同時我覺得這一本書决不應僅介紹給一般的大中學生，而應該介紹給　般的公民的，因爲希望自己做一個完美的公民，盡公民的責任，非要有公民的基本訓練不可，這一本書，可以說是每一個國民所應讀，尤其在這憲法草案已頒佈而尚未實行的現在。該書都十二萬言，三一四頁，定價九角，中華書局出版。</p>

<h3 id="c204">北平大學生的服務運動 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>事情的發展，有時需要等待時間的到來；然而時間的進展，却從不會與你一分一刻的留待！</p>
<p>很淸楚的記得：在上二屆的暑假時期，北平的各大學畢業生，在「畢業卽失業」的情狀之下，曾發起「職業大同盟」的組織。但是，關于他們以後的發展如何？結果怎樣？由于筆者少聞，却沒有知道個詳細。</p>
<p>然而，我們的「時光老人」，却沒有偸閒過，一點沒有留情：春去了，夏來；接着，必然地，各學校的暑假也就將到來——又是一屆了！</p>
<p>雖然，大家明知道我們的社會已經充塞了「過剩」（？）的就業者，無處可給他們容身。「畢業卽失業」已經是成了時代所必然的趨勢！但是，在梭的學生們終不能從此不畢業，不出校吧？</p>
<p>眞的，又是一屆了！要畢業的學生們，終得出校門（事實上學校也容不了他們）進社會！果然，又來了，又是一個「服務大同盟」依舊在北平。據報載：本屆北平各大學畢業生服務運動同盟，定於二十六在朝陽大學成立。並發有宣言，大意謂：「此次服務運動，不僅爲職業，當繼續要求靑年出路問題之適當解决，並聲明運動之動機純潔……」</p>
<p>我們曾聽見要「救救孩子」的呼聲；現在也還有人呌着要「救救中學生」！這樣，在今日，或許將進一步而得到「救救大學生」了！</p>
<p>眞的，據敎育部爲籌備救濟失業的大學生，通令調查所得來的統計，二十二年與二十三年兩年度全國專科以上失業的畢業生，總數有達九千六百二十二大之多。這是近萬啦，還只是前三年的人數！再加上今昨二屆的……是個要驚人的數字啊，那是可肯定的！</p>
<p>在這里，或許我們的「學者」們又將歸咎于一般靑年學子的「不成器」了，担是，想想吧，在今日這個「畢業卽失業」的情勢之下，誰有獲得了什麼保障」呢？</p>
<p>終于，北平各大學的學生們，已經自覺地組織起「服務運動同盟」來了。果然，在今日這個情况之下，我們不能過于希望他們這運動能有什麼良好的結果，但是，我們却不能否認了他們這運動的「時代的意義」。不是嗎？他們那「純潔的動機」，「不僅爲職業，當繼續要求靑年出路問題的之適當解决」呢！</p>
<p>本來，誰也不會否認吧，在今日這破碎的局而之下，什麼都是成爲「問題」，而同時，什麼問題都脫不了社會的關係。而且，事情的發展，有需要等待時機；然而時日的進程，却從不會留待。年靑的人們，要把握了歷史的時機，向前邁進！</p>
<h3 id="c205">關於小劇塲 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這是一個可喜的消息，說是上海將有幾個努力於戲劇運動的朋友，組織　個星期實騐小劇塲，而且已定本月三十一日在新光作第一次公演。</p>
<p>幾年來話劇已消沉了多時，可是這年頭，話劇突然的似乎比較熱鬧起來，在短短的五個月之中，有過不少劇團公演過。不過無論如何，話劇，爲了時間士和空閒上的種種限制，到而今還是沒有深入廣大的羣衆，是任何人不敢否認的。</p>
<p>小劇塲在歐美各國早已盛行了，所謂小劇塲Little　Tbeatre，它的產生是由於對演劇的熱愛，樣式雖有不同，性質是共通的。小劇場和一般的劇塲所具不同之點，就是上演時脫離以營利爲本位的劇曲，以試演爲要圖，採用上演目錄制Repertdire　System。因爲普通的劇塲，每以營利爲目標，那一個劇本賈座好，就多演幾天，賣座不好，就輟演。結果，如其沒有呌座力，就是一個很好的劇本，兩三天後也就輟演，所以一年演幾個劇本，某一個劇本上演幾天，事前沒有規定，，一切以客觀條件而定的。至於小劇塲就不這樣，一年內上演幾個劇本，事前早已排定，依此上演，就是某一個劇本呌座力很大，預　演幾天的，决不延長，反之，呌座力很小的，也要照目錄所定而演出的。</p>
<p>小劇塲發端於法國安端Andre　Antoina　的自由劇塲Free　Tbratre　此後三十年間，演劇史上的全部，可以說全是以小劇塲爲中心。實際上，關於近代演劇的新藝術的全部，如光錢，色彩，樣式化，同時化等，都是由小劇塲才能實現。受了安端的自由劇塲的感化，實現小的舞台，少數的觀衆者，星斯德林堡Strindbery。他在瑞典都城斯德哥爾摩設立了親和劇塲，他在所著「作劇術」一書中，對於小劇塲這樣的向我們說：「劇塲愈小愈好，舞台愈簡素愈好，演技愈自然愈好，人物愈少愈好，幕數愈短愈好，一幕劇不分塲下幕更好。就祗要有一個桌子和兩三個椅子，有三兩個優秀的伶人，可以在二三百有敎養的觀衆之前，表現出從來舞台上所未見的最深刻，銳利，複雜的靈魂的葛藤。以前爲了要把演者的顏面比實在看得更好（其實是更醜），所使用的脚光，須得廢除，只用側光，照着舞台。伶人到台前來向觀客應酬的舉動要廢除，舞台和觀覽，席可以做來同樣高低，在觀覽席的暗裏，露出了牙齒吃東西的習慣要革掉。演劇者的面上，不必塗抹化裝，舞台的裝置，須要有科學的眞　。」他的小劇場計劃，傳到了德國，有雷茵哈德MaxReinberdt創立了室內劇塲，再傳到英，美，俄諸國，都在戲劇上有相當的貢獻。</p>
<p>現在上海的舞台人，也要開始實騐小劇塲了；聽見了這消息，好像得到一種新的興奮：同時，對於這新生的產兒更抱有無窮的希望。第一，我們希望小劇塲把座價减至特低，使每一個愛好話劇的人，得有鑒賞演劇藝術的機會；同時，更希望這種小劇塲能够永久的存在，終年的上演，更由一個而增加到不數個，使話劇深入到廣大的人羣之中。</p>
<h3 id="c206">捕蛇者 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>—江湖上的故事—</p>
<p>埠頭上新來了一艘艒艒船，是夫妻倆個。他們的船里是那樣簡單，不像其餘終年常駐在那里的艒艒船，有捕魚爲生的，有製造玩具的，或出售各種孩子的食品的。所以那艘船開來之後，就引起他們同鄉人的注意。他們四海爲家的常想在同鄉那里探聽一點關於故鄉的消息，雖然他們明知道他們的故鄉始終陷在水災和荒歉的狀熊中。現在一艘甚至連糊口的工具都不齊備的艒艒船開到，他們馬上會回憶着他們自己流出來的那年，故鄉或許又發了一次大水嗎？他們都親切地圍着夫妻倆個探聽他們所要知道的故鄉消息。</p>
<p>但是那對夫妻像他們一樣，從故鄉流出來已經有好多年了，他們這艘簡單的艒艒船也飄過了江南的各小鎮，故鄉的消息他們一點也不知道。</p>
<p>第二天那個男人也上岸做生意了。他善於捕蛇，同時出售一種解蛇毒的藥品。他的手里提着一個特製的小籃，有幾頭垂死的蛇在籃里盤動着，沿途喊着：「阿要捉蛇？阿要捉蛇　？」</p>
<p>那是江南的一個小鎭，一到黃梅時節，人家的牆角里，灶櫥下發現一條蛇在那里仰着頭蠕動着足並不希奇的事；有時走過一條狹小的街道，突然有一條蛇從屋檐下的石隙里躥出來嚇走路人一大跳的。那個捕蛇的男人在街上被發現的時候，馬上有人請他去捉蛇了。他到了人家屋里，伏下身體沿牆璧爬行，彷彿他的鼻子可以嗅出蛇類藏居的地方，有隙縫或小洞的所在，他就用他出售的解毒藥搽在手指上，伸手到洞里去摸索，嘴里吹着唿哨，沒有幾分鐘，一條蛇咬着他的手指被捉出來了。他不受人家的錢，祗要購買他的解毒物，但是那條捉來的蛇他要的，他提着尾巴重重一摔，藏在竹籃里，據他說解毒物就是用蛇肉和一種藥料製合的。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>沒有兩天功夫，鎭上都知道有他這個捕蛇人了。要捕蛇的人家都很早到埠頭上來邀請他。鎭上的巨富，請他在他們的高樓大厦，花園里到處捕捉，他總是用他的鼻子謹愼地嗅聞着，祇要他的手伸到洞里去，沒有捕不着蛇的。</p>
<p>他吿訴人家：他自小生長在深山里，他沒有父親，母親，有一條巨大的蛇扶養他長大，他每天和蛇同居着，現在他的鼻子就能特別嗅出蛇的氣味來。這樣，他被看做一個神人了，因爲那些稗官野史上常有老虎，或人熊把一個拋棄的孩子扶長起來的，那孩子將來總是個英雄。</p>
<p>那個男人每天忙着這家到那家捉蛇，簡直分不過身來。一星期之後，那艘艒艒船突然失蹤了，他們的同鄉都不知夫妻倆個飄到什麼地方去的。但是下一天由鎭上的水巡隊把他們押回鎭來了，他們是江湖上的竊賊，利用捕蛇的機會可以窺視人家財物貯藏的所在而下手偸竊，在那艘艒艒船上搜出許多贓物，都是一星期之內在鎭上偸竊來的。</p>
<p>那個捕蛇的神人於是關進牢子里去了。</p>

<p>— 牧野</p>
<p>「媽的，你瞧；你瞧你這個　熊樣子：你可到底是怎麼弄得呵？怎麼弄得呵？…我問問你！你可是死了半截了嗎？你，你……」</p>
<p>朱大胖子已經是急得滿頭大汗了，他那張褐色臉再加上漲得通紅，倒活像近鄰的那家燒烤，舖裏的烤肉了！他一面用那胖手把頭上臉上的汗抹在手裏又沙的一下子甩到地上，他一面就毫不客氣的猛地伸出了另一隻手扯住了那個的耳朵，把耳朶扯得加倍兒長。</p>
<p>「…五……角……洋哎喲！哎喲！……」</p>
<p>那個黃臉的孩子正抖開了一件開着天窗的舊府綢大褂兒，莫精打彩，有氣無力的嘎聽的呌着，不提防一下子給他扯住了耳朵，臉上立刻起了一陣舊的痙　，眼睛也濕潤了，他哎喲！哎喲的呌了起來。</p>
<p>「哼！我以爲你他媽的死了哪！嗯？…你選會『哎喲』呵！眞有你的！…媽的，你就不會大着點兒嗓子呌嗎？呵，你又不是大姑娘　快！帶勁兒的來！媽的……」</p>
<p>朱大胖子說着就沙的一下子把那胖手上的汗直甩到那個黃臉上去了：那個彷彿沒覺着似的，連眼皮都沒閃一閃，只拿起了一隻手來摸了摸那隻熱辣辣的變紅了的耳朶。遲疑了一會兒，就又抖開了一伴落了色的紅色褲子來。</p>
<p>「咦…咦喲！你一伴漂……亮……紅……褲……」</p>
<p>聲音還是那麼小　嘶啞而無力，並且還帶着些哭腔了！</p>
<p>「你他媽的大點兒聲呵！…你瞧，你這個屌熊樣子！…你就白吃飯嗎？你瞧人家，你瞧！睜開你那個死　眼，來，來！你　……」</p>
<p>可不是嗎，在人家那邊兒可就不是這個樣兒了！不瞧別的，在舖子門口兒的入，起碼堆了足够五六十：在那兒挑檢東西的也有十來個，你眞使得朱大胖子頂難過了，像有付麼東西在心上咬着的一樣。人家那邊兒的人兒是站在油漆得倍兒亮的高高地櫃台上的，人家還是兩個人穿着花花碌碌的衣褲，可比這邊兒的黃臉孩子棒的多了！人家是比手劃脚，活蹦亂跳，還踩的櫃台咚咚地響着：像兩條魚兒似的，嗓子可來得更棒了，給播音機差不離兒的響，你聽：</p>
<p>—喝，喝！這一件長衫，喝！儂瞧瞧看！一隻洋！全新貨色，做新的起碼要二十隻洋鈿！只買一隻洋呵，交關便宜來！</p>
<p>—仔細瞧來，仔細的觀！便宜東西在裏邊！</p>
<p>—喝，喝！儂看看阿拉這件褲子，斜氣便宜！喝，喝！又結實，又漂亮！喝，喝！只賣八角洋呵，八角洋呵！</p>
<p>—仔細觀來，仔細的瞧，便宜東西眞不少！</p>
<p>—喝，喝！儂…交關啦，半隻洋！</p>
<p>—眞不少！眞不少！你要賣來我替你找！</p>
<p>—喝，喝！…………</p>
<p>「你瞧，你瞧人家，睜開你那個死屄眼，你瞧瞧人家……」</p>
<p>朱大胖子氣的吁吁的直呌，他心裏難過的是給人家壓下去了，自己一點兒生意都沒有了。</p>
<p>「咦，喲咦！這一件襯……衫……三…………角……零……八……分……</p>
<p>朱大胖子可氣火了，抹了兩把汗連着沙！沙的甩到那個黃臉上，他　很快的上去扯住了那個底耳朶，這一下子可一直把那個扯倒在地上了，他一面駡一面撲登撲登的用拳頭搥起來了。</p>
<p>「你媽的，我呌你半死不活，揍的你！揍的你就是這一點！不掙氣，不掙氣！你瞧人家，你瞧人家，……」</p>
<p>街上的人都笑了。人家那邊兒是嚷得更高更響了！在聲音裏邊彷彿還夾着一層笑—像是在笑朱大肚子似的，</p>
<p>「我，我受不了了！晚上不能睡覺，天天這麼嚷！…人家，人家人多，還都是大人；我…我受不了，我…」。好半天，那個黃臉的抽噎着說。</p>
<p>「瞧，瞧你這個屄熊樣子，…你做什麼中用？…嗯？…」</p>
<p>拳頭撲登撲登的在背上響起來！</p>
<p>怎麼辦呢？人家那邊那麼熱鬧，嗓子又好，呌的又響，脚跺着櫃台咚咚地響，那麼好聽，像是敲大鼓。圍着的人又多，自己這兒又沒有人兒，連嘎嗓子的黃臉也躺在地上只有哼的份兒什麼也呌不出來了。</p>
<p>「他媽的，老子就是不服氣，不在乎，生意是大家做的！媽的我自己來！喒瞧誰幹得過誰？……」朱大胖子沙沙地甩了幾把汗，惡意的向人家那邊兒看了一眼，他自己就把桌子往前搬了搬，桌子上又擺上了一個凳子，於是朱大胖子氣吁吁的壓得桌子吱咯！吱咯！地爬了上去，他拚命地大聲嚷着：</p>
<p>「喂！喂！喒這裏才眞有便宜東西啦！喂！喂！來呵！這裏…來呵！！！你們來…看呵！！！這件褲…子是全…全新的呵！…只賣…兩毛…大洋呵！……他把那些東西都…都是壞…壞的呵…是在當…當舖裏打出來的舊貨呵！喂！…喂…我…這…裹………」</p>
<p>朱大胖子拚命的大聲呌着，頭上凸起了一條條的怒筋！后來，他也跳，他在小凳子上跳！跥着凳子登登的響着，他差不離兒要變成一雙瘋狂了的野獸了！他臉上流着汗，就又不住的甩着！末了！他太興奮了，眼裏落着大顒的淚，不知道是不小心或是怎麼弄得，他在高踞在大桌子上的凳子上一頭栽了下來，暈倒了！恰好壓在那個黃臉孩子的身上，那個只是一哼！</p>
<p>人家那邊兒就又：——</p>
<p>—這一件哪！喝，喝！…瞧，瞧！…半隻洋！交關便宜！喝，喝！來哉呵！晚了沒特勒！</p>
<p>—仔細瞧來，仔細的觀！便宜的東西在裏邊！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Increases Troops in North China: Response Claims No Violation of Precedent; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders Ambassador to Japan to Lodge Another Strong Protest <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Southwest Executive Department Sends Circular Telegram Opposing Japanese Troop Increase in North China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports: Regarding Japan's increase of troops in North China, after receiving news that Japan intended to increase troops there, the Ministry immediately expressed to the Japanese Embassy in China that this matter was not only factually unnecessary, but also would provoke the Chinese people and was inconsistent with former Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's policy of non-threat and non-aggression. It urged them to pay attention and find ways to prevent it, and telegraphed our ambassador in Japan to make representations to the Japanese Foreign Ministry in writing based on the above. According to Ambassador Xu in Japan's telegram, he received a reply from the Japanese Foreign Ministry stating that the Japanese side, in light of the current unstable situation in Rehe, believed that increasing troops was absolutely necessary to ensure that the Japanese garrison could carry out its mission without regrets. This was based on the Boxer Protocol and did not violate precedents. As for the number of troops to be increased, it would be limited to the minimum necessary and would not threaten our country or infringe on its sovereignty. In reality, the current situation in North China does not have the instability mentioned by the Japanese side. The increase of Japanese troops will only arouse suspicion among the Chinese people. The Ministry has already telegraphed the embassy in Japan to make further strong representations to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>

According to him, after the Chinese personnel met with the neutral commissioners and the British commissioners in Husuang in December last year, they began their work, holding a total of 33 meetings. Both sides examined witnesses and material evidence and personally inspected relevant areas of the boundary to seek a resolution to the first section of the boundary. Subsequently, they successively moved to Jinchangba, Gangmeng, Mengjiao, Mengdong, and other places, conducting on-site investigations of the border area and holding meetings with the British side to discuss various issues related to the boundary line. By the time they were at Laochang, the Qingming Festival had passed, and malaria began to spread from the rainy season. In addition, continuous rain made it impossible to continue the survey work, so it was decided to temporarily adjourn the meeting. A total of 67 meetings were held. All personnel spent their days in deep mountains and wilderness, living a very hard life. The Chinese personnel were able to endure hardship and work calmly, so the results were quite smooth. The neutral chairman was extremely fair in balancing the interests of both countries, and the British commissioners were also able to negotiate various issues in a spirit of friendship.

<h3 id="e12">More Than a Hundred Korean Rōnin Transport Large Quantities of Artificial Silk Southward <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Forcefully Boarded the Through Train to Pukou at Tianjin East Station; Drove Off Our Passengers and Many Accompanied the Goods</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11 PM on the 27th, the Beiping-Pukou passenger train passed through Tianjin East Station in Nanguan. More than 170 rōnin, concealing weapons, forcibly boarded the train with 100 pieces of artificial silk and 30 packs of cigarette paper, occupying passenger seats for transport to the south. Some of the rōnin clenched their fists and glared fiercely, threatening to harm railway staff, so no one dared to interfere and allowed them to transport the goods away. Passengers inside the car were squeezed out of the car to stand outside. An incident also occurred on the 26th night train. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 27th, each train on the Tianjin-Pukou line, except for the through train to Shanghai, had rōnin escorting smuggled goods southward, each time about 100 packages or more. The customs cannot prevent it. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A serious incident occurred here around midnight yesterday. About 150 Korean smugglers carried a large quantity of artificial silk as personal baggage, hoping to board the through train to Pukou southward, but were stopped by the Japanese police who issued a warning. Therefore, they did not load the smuggled goods onto the train and still piled them on the platform. The smugglers decided to use various methods to transport the goods out. They carried heavy sticks, waiting for the train to Pukou passing through Tianjin at midnight. Shortly after the train arrived at the East Station, they crowded into the third-class passenger cars, even driving off the Chinese passengers, and then moved 522 pieces of artificial silk onto the train, with many people accompanying the goods. This act is a direct challenge to Chinese customs. According to official announcements, Cangxian, about 60 miles south of Tianjin, now has a customs anti-smuggling office. The train then passed through Cangxian several hours later, and no news has been received that customs officers there have interfered. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 26th, smuggling rōnin forcibly loaded goods at Tianjin East Station, and the Jinpu Railway Bureau, instructed by the customs, asked to see the tax payment receipt, but was refused, almost leading to a conflict. Soldiers from a certain country stationed at the station intervened and armed to protect the rōnin from loading the train, watching them transport it out of the station. Although the railway is willing to assist the customs in implementing the new anti-smuggling law, the environment does not permit it. The customs has received an order from the Ministry to send a special commissioner to Tianjin to investigate the local situation and discuss a flexible method. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the 25th of this month, Nantong seized a Japanese man named Yamasaki Takeshi without a license, who claimed to be Nakamura Hara. His behavior was suspicious. After the local authorities interrogated him through his translator, he claimed to have smuggled artificial silk from Dalian, landed at Lüsi in Nantong, and subsequently obtained three other Japanese men, Morita Nuomi et al., more than 20 pounds of smuggled artificial silk, and two informants. The Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered Ge, the Nantong District Commissioner, to hand over the four captured Japanese men, Yamasaki Takeshi et al., to the Capital Police Department, which will transfer them to the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing for handling according to law. The smuggled goods will be confiscated according to regulations, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will negotiate with the Japanese side to take action. (Special telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Because the markets in Tianjin East are filled with smuggled goods, they are almost all free trade markets. Prices are low, and domestic goods are on the brink of extinction.

After disembarking, they went to meet with Yan Xishan to discuss military matters regarding the pursuit and suppression of bandits in Shaanxi. Tang Enbo left Taiyuan for Xi'an on the 27th, and Guan Linzheng arrived in Taiyuan on the 27th. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) Zhang Xueliang, Chen Cheng, Yang Hucheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Yu Xuezhong, and Zhu Jingguang held lengthy discussions on the 25th evening regarding the defense against bandits in Gansu Province, which did not end until late at night. Zhu Shaoliang hosted a banquet for Zhang et al. on the 26th at noon. At 2:30 PM, Zhang, Chen, et al. still flew to Ningxia by Boeing aircraft. Zhu Shaoliang, Yu Xuezhong, and dozens of others went to the airport to see them off. The plane was piloted by Zhang himself, with two foreign co-pilots accompanying him. After taking off, it circled several times above the Buddha bathing ceremony at W泉山 before flying east. It arrived in Ningxia at about 4:30 PM. Before his departure, Zhang also met with reporters from the Central News Agency at the Moral Endeavour Society and discussed various issues in the Northwest in detail. He stated that the remnant bandits in western Shanxi were crossing the river and causing chaos, and that arrangements have now been made for encirclement and suppression. He has already obtained proper methods on this trip. It is still difficult to determine whether the remnant bandits gathered in Yanchuan and Yanchang in northern Shaanxi intend to flee again. It is also difficult to predict their movements, because the actions of the Red bandits are sometimes unexpected. However, this time, the encirclement and suppression will completely eliminate them on the spot. He said that the most difficult thing about suppressing bandits is the transportation of materials, because the highway network in northern Shaanxi has not been completed, the terrain is complex, and there are many ditches. Next, political facilities and local post-disaster arrangements are also extremely important. In fact, the role of the military is only one-tenth of the whole. Recalling the European War, there were three types of people who occupied the main position: first, those who built roads in the front; second, those who manufactured ammunition in the rear; and third, those who fired guns in the front. It can be seen that war cannot rely solely on military force, and bandit suppression is especially an example. The reporter then told Zhang about the disaster situation in Hexi. Zhang was quite moved and said that this was not fair to the people and the region. In addition to actively providing relief, the government also hopes that the local authorities will add comfort and pity. Zhang did not say where he was flying to Ningxia. The date of returning to Shaanxi is not yet set. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Analysis of Recent Anglo-Italian Relations <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>After Italy announced the annexation of Abyssinia, the important tasks were, on the one hand, how to develop the newly acquired land, and on the other hand, how to terminate the economic sanctions of Geneva and make all countries recognize the facts created by its war of aggression. The former is Italy's domestic problem, which can be planned leisurely; the latter is the problem that Italy urgently needs to solve now, because the continuation of economic sanctions and the deterioration of international relations seriously hinder Italy's position. The implementation of the Geneva economic sanctions, although ostensibly implemented by more than 50 member states of the League of Nations, is actually entirely launched and supported by the United Kingdom. Therefore, if Italy wants to improve its international relations and extricate itself from its extremely isolated position, the first thing it must do is to adjust its relationship with the United Kingdom. What policies Mussolini has recently adopted to improve Anglo-Italian relations is very worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Italy's current diplomacy towards the United Kingdom can be said to adopt a combination of soft and hard tactics, that is, on the one hand, it tries its best to threaten the interests of the United Kingdom in Africa and the Near East, and on the other hand, it directly or indirectly expresses its willingness to start negotiations with the United Kingdom to protect its vested interests. Italy wants to use this parallel approach to force the United Kingdom to submit and change its anti-Italian attitude. We can clarify Italy's tough diplomatic approach with the following points: Regarding the interests of Lake Tana's water source, which the United Kingdom obtained through the Anglo-French-Italian agreement, Italy expressed its unwillingness to guarantee this. The famous journalist Gaida of the Fascist newspaper "Italian Daily" had a special article elaborating on this matter. After Italian troops occupied Addis Ababa, the newly appointed Governor-General of Abyssinia, General Botterglio, indirectly expressed that he did not recognize the status of the embassy and consular personnel of the United Kingdom and France, and only regarded them as distinguished guests. Later, he requested the United Kingdom to withdraw its company of Indian soldiers stationed in the embassy in Addis Ababa. In the British colonies in the Near East, the outbreak of anti-British movements was incited. In the recent anti-British movement of Arabs in Palestine, Italy took the opportunity to instigate. In Palestine and India, Italy rebuilt radio stations to promote anti-British movements in local languages. In addition, expressing that if the League of Nations does not lift sanctions against Italy next month, Italy will announce its withdrawal, which is also a means of threat. As for the soft tactics it has adopted, there are the following facts: The Black Shirt Prime Minister claimed when he met with the reporter of the French "Le Soir" on the 20th that he had no demands on the United Kingdom and was willing to provide the United Kingdom with all possible guarantees. The Italian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, visited the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Vansittart, on the 21st. According to Havas News Agency, the purpose of this meeting was twofold: one was for the United Kingdom and Italy to sign an agreement incorporating the promises provided by Italy, that is, Italy will not threaten the interests of the British Empire in Egypt, Sudan, and the Near East; and the other was to conclude a Mediterranean agreement. The purpose of this hard and soft diplomatic policy is nothing more than to make the United Kingdom, for the sake of its own vested interests, give up its anti-Italian attitude.</p>
<p>So, what attitude does the United Kingdom take towards Italy? Generally, pragmatists in the British government, considering that Italy has already annexed Abyssinia, it is absolutely impossible to share a piece of the pie from Mussolini's mouth now. Therefore, they strongly advocate compromising with Italy and improving Anglo-Italian relations in order to obtain Italy's guarantee for the vested interests of the United Kingdom in the Near East. However, the majority of the British public now insists on intensifying sanctions against Italy. Therefore, the United Kingdom's attitude towards Italy may not change much for a while. Even if the British government changes its attitude towards Italy in the coming months, it does not mean that the interests of the two major imperialists of the United Kingdom and Italy have been completely compromised and resolved. The reason why the United Kingdom has done this is only because it is temporarily compromising with Italy due to environmental factors, while actively expanding its military preparations (such as the retention of the 40,000-ton naval ship and the opening of the port of Cape Town in South Africa as a naval base), accumulating strength to wait for the opportunity to come. Then, the future of Anglo-Italian relations can be imagined.</p>

<p>Japan's Actions Directly Intend to Overthrow China; League of Nations Should Impose Sanctions on Japan If It Is Fair</p>
<p>(New York) In recent days, newspapers have still commented extensively on Japan's troop increase and smuggling incidents in North China. They are deeply worried about Japan's armed aggression. The San Francisco Examiner and other Hearst newspapers published the same editorial on the 16th of this month, advocating that the League of Nations should impose sanctions on Japan, stating that Japan's violation of human rights, justice, world peace, and culture is even more cruel than Italy's, and the League of Nations only knows to impose sanctions on Italy, but does not know that there is still Japan. If the League of Nations is fair and honest, then it can only impose sanctions on Japan immediately. We may cancel the sanctions against Italy. The San Francisco Chronicle commented on the 18th that Japan's actions directly intend to overthrow China, and its destruction of the overall treaty is secondary. After the League of Nations declared Japan an aggressor, it became silent, and Japan's actions in North China became more active as soon as Italy's declaration of annexing Abyssinia was issued. This kind of mutual imitation is the usual behavior of countries in the world. On the same day, the Boston Globe stated that Japan, in view of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, is also actively engaged in North China and is now planning to control China by force. China's protests are regarded as nothing. The United Kingdom only sees it taking the slow diplomatic route, and seeking the help of the United States is also to no avail.

<p>Saying Ambition Is to Control All of Asia</p>
<p>(Washington) Many well-known senators today all stated that Japan's troop increase in North China is "another step towards controlling Asia." Senator Bourne, a Democrat who has always advocated that the United States strictly adhere to neutrality, also said today that Japan cannot control its warlords. In fact, it has already broken out in East Asia and will continue to expand its power in China until China rectifies its internal affairs and may drive them out. Japan's occupation of China may only satisfy its restless nation psychologically, but its warlords can use this to demand inflated military spending, because Japan knows that the world will not fight it, so it dares to do whatever it wants. Senator King, a Democrat and member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that Japan will not stop its actions until it controls all of Asia. Senator Thomas, a Democrat, said that this action may lead to a great war one day. After the war, one country will surely rise up and control most of the world. Although this cannot be predicted with a time limit, it is inevitable. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Whenever the United States has a plan to assist China, Japan makes a further threat. China's revenge will be at the time of the Russo-Japanese War." (National telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) The activities of the National Socialist Party within Austria show signs of revival everywhere. It is rumored that this is instigated by Germany. During a rally held by the Austrian Patriotic Front in Gusso, Upper Austria, a National Socialist spokesperson delivered a speech advocating for the unification of Germany and Austria. Upon hearing this, party members present cheered enthusiastically. According to political observers, the National Socialists are now planning to force a plebiscite to submit the issue of German-Austrian unification to a vote. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to sources in Vienna, the troop strength in the Italian province of Tyrol (bordering Austria) will be increased from 21,000 to 25,000. In addition, Italy plans to form a Fascist Party army unit of approximately 4,000 men. Regarding this matter, Italian military officials have clarified that the measures taken by the authorities in Tyrol are not of a special nature. The troop strength in the area has never decreased; however, since last November, many soldiers have requested leave to return home, resulting in a slight reduction in numbers. As for the establishment of the Fascist Party army, it has been in existence for some time. Recently, the party headquarters decided that all party members should join the party army, leading to an increase in numbers. This is the case nationwide, not just in the Austrian border region. Furthermore, party army soldiers were originally affiliated with the army reserve, but after joining the party army, they can be mobilized immediately on the spot, without having to wait for a certain period of time like the reserves. This is the only point of difference. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Leaders of the various branches of the Home Guard held a meeting yesterday, chaired by former Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. It was decided to move the group's headquarters from Vienna to Linz (in Upper Austria). This move is intended to disperse the Home Guard's leadership to the provinces, especially Upper Austria, as the members in that province are skilled in combat. After the meeting, the branch leaders issued a communiqué stating that they had reaffirmed their determination to fight to the end in order to achieve the original goals of the Home Guard. They also expressed unconditional loyalty to Prince Starhemberg. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Judging from the results of the secret meeting of the Home Guard's provincial leaders, the Home Guard will not be eliminated without a serious battle. The Home Guard issued a communiqué stating that it has moved its headquarters to Linz (the birthplace of Home Guard leader Starhemberg, who was recently dismissed from his position as Vice-Chancellor) and appointed Mr. Weninger as the group's chief of staff. The conference reaffirmed the determination to fight for the Home Guard's objectives and expressed loyalty to Starhemberg. Reuters learned from the highest authority that the Home Guard's new policy is to refuse to surrender arms under any circumstances, as Chancellor Schuschnigg intends to order the group to disarm. The Home Guard will join the official militia as much as possible, while remaining loyal to the Home Guard. The remaining members will be reorganized to resist disarmament. Vice-Chancellor Baron Feil and other cabinet members from the Home Guard in Schuschnigg's cabinet will not leave the government. Judging from the current situation, there will be a fierce struggle.

<p>(Moscow) It is rumored that the Soviet government now advocates reconciliation with Italy, believing that the Berlin policy is more detrimental to European peace than the Rome policy. The newspaper Izvestia published an article by Radek stating that the Soviet Union will try to implement the regional peace agreement proposed by the late French Foreign Minister Barthou (assassinated with the King of Yugoslavia in Marseille in October 1934) to organize collective security. Collective security is the only way to maintain peace. Britain cannot independently resist Italy's aggression and protect its interests. Anglo-German amity has caused concern among countries fearing German aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Radek wrote in "News" about the start of Anglo-German negotiations on the rearmament of the Rhineland, saying, "The League of Nations' failure to address the Abyssinian issue was due to Britain's readiness to protect its African interests, but unwillingness to effectively ensure European peace. The main conclusion from the current situation is that the Abyssinian experience proves the correctness of the following argument: a country cannot obtain a guarantee of peace for itself alone. Britain is unwilling to undertake effective, concrete, and joint obligations, and its security is now being shaken by this policy. It has not only failed to prevent Italian aggression, but it must now fear the actions of Italian and German imperialism. Therefore, Britain will consider making concessions to Italy in order to concentrate its forces against Germany, and the plans on that side are also maturing. This is fraught with the greatest danger, not only for world peace, but also for Britain itself." (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Associated Press learned today that the new French government will base its foreign policy on consolidating relations with France, Russia, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente, thereby tightening the encirclement of Germany. If Italy is unwilling to restore the Stresa Front and support France's position on the Rhineland issue, France will become cool towards Italy. Mr. Delbos is likely to become Foreign Minister. Delbos advocates retaliation against Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland. His selection as Foreign Minister proves that the new government will adopt a tough policy towards Germany. Delbos has also criticized the Hoare-Laval Pact, deeming it too biased towards Italy, and opposed former Prime Minister Laval's policy of appeasement towards Germany. He himself has always advocated that French policy should be based on close cooperation with Britain. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The future Prime Minister Léon Blum is now actively preparing to form a cabinet. Today, he met with the current Minister of Justice Delbos, leading figures of the Radical Socialist Party, and important figures of the orthodox Socialist Party, namely financial expert Olivar and Monnet, for a considerable amount of time. According to well-informed sources, Olivar will be the Minister of Finance, Monnet will be the Minister of Agriculture, and Delbos will be the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the future cabinet. At this time, each party caucus is preparing to submit bills as the new Chamber of Deputies is about to convene. The 72 Communist deputies held their first meeting this morning and decided to request the Chamber of Deputies to organize a committee to investigate the sources of private property of several prominent members of parliament, such as former Prime Minister and right-wing member of parliament Ota Dieau, former Prime Minister Senator Laval, the current Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Puisson, and former leader of the Socialist Party Fiolance. Laval, Puisson, and Fere are originally important figures in the Socialist Party. Later, Puisson and Fere both automatically withdrew from the party, and Laval joined the central faction in 1924. Currently, the Communist deputies are strongly attacking Puisson and have announced that if Puisson still submits his candidacy when the new Chamber of Deputies convenes to elect the Speaker, the Communist Party will strongly oppose him.

<p>(London) According to political predictions, the British government may propose to abolish the current sanctions, subject to a condition: that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must show a spirit of compromise before the meeting of the League of Nations Council (meeting on the 16th of next month), and promise that Italy's actions in Abyssinia will be as if Abyssinia is a mandated territory.

Britain would be pleased if Mussolini could voluntarily offer the above promise, but Britain will not initiate any contact with the Italian government. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources have recently declared that the British cabinet's unease about Anglo-Italian relations is increasing. The cabinet's final attitude towards sanctions has not yet been decided, but Italy's current attitude, especially its anti-British propaganda, is not enough to prompt the cabinet to abandon its policy of sanctions against Italy. In addition, the cabinet is also quite anxious about Germany. It is generally expected that the German government will answer several major points of the questions raised by Britain in a negative manner, and that a certain dictator would rather use "hostile conspiracy methods" against Britain than be open and honest.

<p>Yugoslav Capital: Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's visit here, which departed from Warsaw yesterday, is scheduled to arrive here at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. He plans to stay for two days and have two face-to-face talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stoyadinovich. Political figures have announced that the discussions between the two will focus on the issues of European collective security and the reorganization of the League of Nations. Regarding this, Poland and Yugoslavia are in the same situation under the complex international situation, especially at the time of the Four-Power Pact signed by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1933 (at that time, Poland was deeply afraid that after the Four-Power Pact was signed, France and Germany would become close and disregard Poland, while Yugoslavia feared that France and Italy would become close and abandon Yugoslavia). Therefore, on the two issues of European collective security and the reorganization of the League of Nations, their opinions have long been converging. This time, it only needs to be clarified to complete the matter. In addition, when Beck meets with Stoyadinovich, he will also discuss the economic relations between the two countries, paying particular attention to the issues of Yugoslavia's control of imported goods and Poland's management of foreign exchange. Semi-official sources say that Beck's trip has another purpose, namely to act as a mediator between Hungary and Yugoslavia, and to make the relations between Poland and the Little Entente even closer through Yugoslavia's mediation. After the former Polish Prime Minister Gulsiagowski visited the Hungarian capital at the end of last month, Colonel Beck had a proposal to visit here. However, due to the many political events in Poland, the trip was postponed until now. In recent months, Polish opposition figures have also been actively promoting propaganda in Yugoslavia, and journalists and students have been visiting here one after another. Representatives of the press in the two countries are scheduled to meet here at the end of this week, and the Polish representatives will take the opportunity to visit the entire territory of Yugoslavia.

<p>(London) The White Star Line's new ocean liner "Queen Mary," whose magnificence is unparalleled, set sail from Southampton at 4:34 p.m. today to make its maiden voyage across the Atlantic amidst the cheers of 250,000 people. The British regard the ship as the "Queen of the Seven Seas." When twelve small tugboats towed it away from the dock, the excitement of the audience was unprecedented. The ships in the harbor all sounded their sirens, and airplanes and seaplanes soared around, saluting and playing music to send her off. As the ship slowly sailed towards the Strait, more than 20,000 spectators followed behind in various small boats. After the ship arrives at Cherbourg, it will go straight to New York, and it is expected to reach it in four days. Reuters has learned that the ship has not decided whether to seize the "Blue Riband" for Atlantic speed on this maiden voyage. Everything will be decided by Captain Sir Edgar Britten depending on the situation of the voyage. The "Blue Riband" is currently held by the French liner "Normandy," which sailed from Southampton to New York in four days, three hours, and five minutes on its maiden voyage in June last year, with an average speed of 29.98 knots per hour. A total of eighteen trains and hundreds of steamships carried people from all over the country who came to Southampton to watch the departure of the Queen Mary today. Five special ferries from London carried the 2,650 passengers of the "Queen Mary" to Southampton. Many passengers came from distant parts of the world, including those from Shanghai. Dozens of Americans made a special trip across the Atlantic to England to enjoy this maiden voyage. The photos taken when the ship departed were made into a film and specially sent to Cherbourg by plane on the same day as the horse racing film, and screened on the ship that night. The crew believes that the ship will easily win the "Blue Riband" for Atlantic speed, but everything depends on the weather. When asked about the captain, the captain replied that he hoped to arrive in New York at noon on Monday next week. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Murai, the Consul-General stationed in Australia, reported to the Foreign Ministry on the 26th that the Australian government's implementation of tariff revisions is extremely unfavorable to Japan. Although Customs Minister Gullett stated that it would not have a major impact on trade between Japan and Australia, there is little hope for the future development of Japanese goods in Australia. As a result of the tariff revisions, the import of Japanese cotton cloth is practically impossible; only a very small amount of cotton cloth for manufacturing bags can be imported, but the quantity is insignificant. The Australian government claims to grant unlimited preferential treatment to Japanese goods, but since Japanese goods are subject to high tariffs, their import is effectively blocked. The import of rayon has decreased by 80% as a result of the new tariffs. (Domei News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>(London) Lieutenant General Wauchope, the British High Commissioner for Palestine, reported to the British government today that the situation throughout Palestine is significantly calmer than before. The British warship HMS Barham, flying the flag of British Admiral Pound, has now arrived at Jaffa. It is reported that the area is generally peaceful, except for occasional burning of Jewish crops and occasional shootings. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Armed Arab bands are now even more audacious, especially in northern Palestine. Their actions are gradually resembling an uprising against the government. They often lie in ambush to attack individuals and shoot at mechanized convoys with armed guards. Many Jewish farmers' crops have been burned, and telephone lines are frequently cut, causing this city to be unable to communicate with Haifa and Cairo yesterday. It is now believed that Arab leaders are preparing to call off the strike and curb the riots, as they are gradually realizing that they cannot control the zealous youths.

In addition to implementing various riot prevention plans, the High Commissioner is now also restricting the activities of agitators and strike leaders.

<p>Safeguarding the International Rule of Law System Held as a Fundamental Belief</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: During today's session of the Lower House, Conservative Party member Bach questioned the current international situation. Foreign Minister Sandler replied, stating in brief: "Looking at the current international situation, we should deeply study the current system and mode of action of the League of Nations, as well as the possibility of expanding the scope of cooperation among countries to safeguard peace. We have gained experience from the Abyssinian question and are therefore hesitant and at a loss as to how to implement sanctions in the future and how they should be implemented. What we should deeply study at this moment is, of course, the question of whether the content of certain articles of the League of Nations Covenant and their implementation methods should be revised. In addition, we should also pay attention to how these articles interact with each other. The purpose of this is none other than to enhance the League of Nations' power to act in order to eliminate war. Fortunately, some major countries are sometimes willing to take on the task of eliminating war. In the future, we should strive to create conditions for the cooperation of major countries and make them more universal. As for the small countries, the following principles are tied to their fundamental beliefs. What are these principles? The League of Nations Covenant and the policies adopted are only for the purpose of safeguarding the public interest and safeguarding the international rule of law system, and this policy should be implemented uniformly for all issues. Although a neutral policy can also maintain security, its effectiveness is difficult to compare with other tools, such as a policy of solidarity and unity. Considering our own country, we should adopt a firm stance on international issues that have a direct interest to our country or when other countries make legitimate appeals to our country, so as to participate in cooperation for the international rule of law system. Otherwise, we should stay out of it. Based on this, although our country should cooperate closely with other countries, the attitude we adopt should be "the same as those countries, and we do not want to be unique." During today's discussion, one left-wing member argued that Sweden should withdraw from the League of Nations, but other members did not support his view. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Hankou) The Xiang River rose abruptly by more than a丈 (unit of measurement, approx. 3.3 meters) on the 25th and 26th. The water level at Zhao Jiaqiao on the Xiang Dike rose to 45 meters, and the water barrier was in danger. After strenuous efforts to rescue it, it finally collapsed on the evening of the 26th. Currently, the Remote Dike is being rescued. The Xiangyang Flood Relief Association telegraphed on the evening of the 26th that a section of the Black Dragon Temple on the Laolong Dike was in danger. Due to the rising water and rapid flow, many cracks were found. Please quickly instruct the dike engineering bureau there to urgently repair it. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xi Dejiong, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, received a telegram from the Xiang Dike Engineering Office stating that the water level in Yunyang rose abruptly by approximately 7 meters on the 26th, and the water level in Xiangyang had reached above 13 meters, an abrupt rise of approximately 4 meters compared to the 25th, breaking the record for the same period in previous years. It is predicted that when the water reaches Zhongxiang, the water level must rise sharply, exceeding 45 meters. It was found that after the breach at the third and fourth sections last year was blocked this spring, a water barrier was built, with its top point reaching only 45 meters. It is bound to overflow and collapse. The Remote Dike project, which is under construction, is nearing completion and is extremely precarious. The workers are currently racing against time to rescue it, etc. After receiving the telegram, Xi immediately flew back to Hankou and then to the construction site to supervise the defense of the Remote Dike.

<p>Representatives from Six Provinces and Cities Arrive and Resolve Important Cases</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River Conservancy Association convened a flood prevention conference at 2:00 p.m. on the 27th, gathering representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and the City of Nanjing. The conference was convened because the Yangtze River below Hankou, in areas such as Jiujiang, Xunyang, Anqing, and Wuhu, has experienced high base water levels due to heavy rainfall this spring, and the recent rise in water level has been rapid, comparable to the water level during the same period in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). The dike restoration work in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces this year was delayed due to spring rains, and the arrival of the water this year was early. The conference aimed to coordinate flood prevention work. The attendees included Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, Wen Yi, Technical Officer, Yan Fangtian, Director of the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau, Qiu Baozhong, Chief Engineer, Xi Dejiong, representative of Hubei, Lin Baoyuan, representative of Jiangsu, Song Xishang, representative of Nanjing, Zheng Zhaojing of the Economic Committee's Water Conservancy Department, and Xu Baoju, Chief of the Yangtze River Conservancy Association's General Affairs Department. Fu Rulin, the chairman, delivered the opening speech. The Economic Committee's representative then delivered a speech. The representatives reported in turn on the flood prevention process last year, the achievements of this year's dike restoration project, and the preparations for this year's flood prevention. After the reports, various proposals were discussed, and the following important cases were resolved: 1. Whether the general outline of the Yangtze River flood prevention measures should be revised. It was resolved to pass the revised version. 2. Song Xishang proposed that the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission should telegraph the daily water level along the river to the provincial and municipal governments during the flood season. It was resolved that the association should send a letter to the Central Broadcasting Station requesting it to report the water level on time and broadcast the rainfall reports simultaneously. 3. Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and the City of Nanjing jointly proposed how to request subsidies and allocate flood prevention funds this year. It was resolved that the association should submit a request to the central government to prepare 200,000 yuan in flood prevention funds this year and issue them to the provincial and municipal governments for planning and management at the dangerous water level. 4. The Anhui Provincial Government proposed matters to be handled for flood prevention and requested that the amount of subsidies for flood prevention in other provinces be determined and allocated. It was resolved that items 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the proposal had been reported in detail, and item 5, the protection of dike workers, should be handled separately. The meeting concluded at 6:00 p.m. and a group photo was taken. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Wu Dingchang Talks About the Reasons for Establishing a Fish Market by the Ministry of Industries <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Fish Merchants Can Buy and Sell Freely, Not Under Unified Control; Vegetable Oil Plant is Cooperation with Merchants</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, issued the following statement on the 27th: In recent days, foreign newspapers have been unclear about the truth regarding the undertakings handled by the Ministry, such as the Shanghai fish market and the vegetable oil plant, and have either called them unified control or mistaken them for monopolies. According to the facts, this is not true. The reason why the Ministry established the fish market is that the supply of fish food to the millions of citizens of Shanghai is important. The original market at Xiaodongmen had narrow wharves and incomplete storage facilities, which were not enough to supply the entire city with fish food, let alone supply the upstream of the Yangtze River with edible sea fish, which hinders the development of the fishing industry. Therefore, following the example of other countries, a fish market was built in Yangshupu, which is convenient for water transportation, using the latest equipment to seek the corresponding supply and demand of edible fish. On the one hand, methods are devised to provide relief to fishermen, and at the same time, in consideration of the old fish shops in Xiaodongmen, they are all given priority as brokers and invited to join. Not only are they prevented from losing their jobs, but they can also help them develop the fish market. However, the fish exchange is the same as other commodity exchanges. According to the fish market's business regulations, only the first transaction must be held in the fish market in order to freely and publicly auction, equalize fish prices, and avoid manipulation and hoarding, which would harm the interests of fishermen and consumers. After this, fish merchants can freely buy and sell in various places without restriction. The saying that it is unified control is naturally unfounded. Secondly, the rumor that tung oil is a monopoly is even more inconsistent with the facts. The purpose of the Ministry in establishing a vegetable oil plant is to cooperate with tung oil merchants to establish a company, with the intention of improving the quality of tung oil and establishing product standards, so that foreign businessmen who buy tung oil can benefit from good quality and factory prices. It does not restrict the freedom of Chinese and foreign merchants to buy and sell tung oil and does not contain the meaning of government controlling trade. In short, the Ministry hopes that the domestic agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors can each establish a healthy body, and independently control and improve. If merchants and people lack the strength, the government is willing to cooperate with them to carry out the project, so that agriculture, industry, and commerce can adapt to the world's economic trends, unite and develop, and hold the goal of good quality and cheap prices to make up for the world's deficiencies with China's surplus. If all industries cannot unite and seek improvement, it is no longer what the times allow, and the government's responsibility is to promote its progress. The Ministry has always been determined to cooperate with merchants and people in various industries. Past undertakings have been like this, and future facilities will be no exception.

Our attendees were Chief Commissioner Liang Yugao, Commissioner Yin Mingde, and Secretary-Director Li Liying. We held a total of thirty-three meetings there. Both sides presented witnesses and material evidence, and personally inspected relevant locations along the border line in order to resolve the first section of the boundary line. Afterward, we continuously moved to Jin Chang Ba (i.e., Lufang), Gang (i.e., near Ban Hong), Meng Jiao, Meng Dong, Laba, Lao Chang, and other places. On the one hand, we conducted on-site surveys of the boundary area. On the other hand, we held meetings with the British side to discuss various boundary line issues. By the time we were in Lao Chang, the Qingming Festival had passed, and miasma began to emerge with the rainy season. Coupled with continuous rain, surveying and demarcation work could not continue, so we decided to temporarily adjourn the meeting. In total, we held sixty-seven meetings. All personnel were in the deep mountains and wilderness, and all aspects of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation were very arduous. Furthermore, there were many local savages, ethnic minorities outside the pale of civilization, so the safety of the commission personnel could have been endangered at any time. Fortunately, the security team was very effective, and the Chinese staff were able to endure hardship and work calmly, so the boundary survey went quite smoothly. As for the head of the neutral commission, he was very fair and impartial for the sake of balance between the two countries. The British commissioners were also able to negotiate various issues in a spirit of friendship, as can be seen in the speeches of all parties at the closing of the meeting."</p>
<p>Closing Remarks of the Neutral Commissioner</p>
<p>"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chinese and British delegations for their surveyors and security teams, and to thank the commissioners of both sides for their spirit of cooperation."</p>
<p>Closing Remarks of Commissioner Liang</p>
<p>"Before the adjournment of this session, I propose that we formally thank the head of the neutral commission. During this time, the head of the neutral commission presided over all work of this meeting, fully utilizing his wisdom, spirit, and ability to lead this meeting. He was also able to judge the views of both sides with fairness and impartiality, which is very admirable to us. Moreover, his boundary work experience was of great assistance to this meeting. As for the areas that required on-site investigation, even though he fell from his horse and injured his foot, he was unwilling to lose even an hour of the meeting's time due to his personal injury. He personally went to the high mountains and steep ridges with his injury to conduct field surveys and investigations, striving to clarify the truth as the basis for his judgment. He did not omit a single word of the work stipulated in the "Task Outline" established by the two governments. This spirit of dedicated service is also worthy of our admiration. Of course, we often had different views from the head of the neutral commission on various issues. When we reached these different views, I knew that his judgment was based on his own conscience and his own beliefs. I hope that the head of the neutral commission will be able to come and guide us again when we continue our work next time. In addition to proposing a formal thank you to the head of the neutral commission, I would also like to record the pleasure of working with the British commissioners this time. Of course, we also had different views, but in the midst of these different views, we were often able to understand each other's difficulties. I hope that the work of our two parties can help our governments to resolve this decades-long pending case and further the friendship between the two great powers."</p>
<p>Closing Remarks of Clague</p>
<p>"I very much agree with Commissioner Liang's opinion. The head of the neutral commission's experience in boundary affairs can indeed provide us with extremely valuable assistance. This section of the boundary line was left unresolved by General Liu and Scoggs twenty-six years ago. We hope to resolve this issue based on the boundary experience of the head of the neutral commission. Commissioner Liang also said that the head of the neutral commission's judgment is based entirely on conscience. I am very happy to second Commissioner Liang's proposal. I am also very grateful to the Chinese delegation for the various assistance they provided to us when we passed through various parts of China, especially the assistance that our surveying team and food transport team received in the South, which was even more valuable. I feel very happy to work with Commissioner Liang Yugao and others this time. I wish the head of the neutral commission and the Chinese commissioner a safe journey back."</p>
<p>North China Smuggling Difficulties</p>
<p>Concerns Remain Regarding New Anti-Smuggling Measures</p>
<p>Japanese Side Still Wants to Reduce Tariffs</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Central Government has recently promulgated the North China Anti-Smuggling Regulations, which the Tianjin Customs has successively received. However, there are many obstacles to implementation. Furthermore, because the assistance of railway authorities is needed, the Jinpu Railway was directly ordered by the Ministry of Railways to set up tax checkpoints at stations and inspection offices along the line, and customs officers boarded trains to inspect passengers. This was not a problem. Only the Beining Railway Bureau, under pressure from foreign forces, had more concerns and was unwilling to immediately comply with the Ministry's order. In terms of diplomacy, the Jicha Political Affairs Commission previously instructed Xiao Zhenying to be responsible for negotiations with the Japanese side. The Japanese military and the Japanese consulate expressed a unified focus on reducing tariffs. They stated that if another preferential tariff treaty for North China were concluded, smugglers would have no profit to gain, and smuggling would cease on its own. Xiao once relayed this idea to the Ministry of Finance and the Jicha Political Affairs Commission. However, the Central Government has indirectly made it clear that reducing tariffs is impossible. Therefore, diplomatically speaking, there is currently no solution. The Beining Railway Bureau is also using this as an excuse to shirk responsibility and delay, intending to evade the issue. Xu Liya, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, and Sipu, the Anti-Smuggling Commissioner, have repeatedly contacted Lin Shize, the Customs Superintendent, and representatives of the Beining Railway Bureau, seeking to study a peaceful and appropriate solution within the new central law. As a result, no new decision has been reached. Because of the repeated urging of the customs, the Beining Railway Bureau has begun to consult with the Ministry of Railways and the Jicha Political Affairs Commission, waiting for a reply before making a decision. However, this is not a time when the authorities have the power to make a firm decision. The reply will not arrive in the end, and the Beining Railway Bureau will not provide substantial assistance in the end. Because of the difficulty in strictly suppressing smuggling, the Customs is currently only rectifying matters within its own scope. A few days ago, it specifically ordered customs officers not to neglect their duties or collude with vagrants to harbor smuggling. Otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed when discovered. Although this is close to empty words, it is quite necessary at this time.</p>
<p>In recent months, due to the excessive smuggling of sugar, the sales of domestic sugar have been almost completely seized. Traditionally, domestic sugar in Tianjin is divided into Fujian, Chaozhou, and Shantou factions, with more than 100 wholesale shops in total. The peak season for goods is in spring and autumn, shipped by Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessels. Sales in the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi also use Tianjin as a transit point. The annual arrival of goods is about 50 million bags. From this spring to the present, it has gradually become a situation where there are goods but no market. Statistics show that less than 500,000 bags have arrived. In the past, each bag of 100 catties sold for 18 yuan, but now it sells for 10 yuan. Even with a price drop of 8 yuan, few people are interested. Smuggled sugar currently sells for 5 yuan per 100 catties. Compared to this, domestic sugar is twice as expensive, so buyers naturally abandon this and choose that. Therefore, from March to the present, more than 70 of the 100 or so wholesale shops have closed down, and only 30 or so are barely supporting themselves. They have also sent telegrams to their headquarters in Fujian, Chaozhou, and Shantou, stopping the arrival of goods. If smuggling continues to be so rampant, these 30 or so shops will probably be unable to maintain themselves in three months.</p>
<p>According to customs investigations, the smuggling of rayon was most prevalent from February to late April, with a total of 4.78 million pieces transported. Imports were fewer in May, with about 500,000 pieces. In total, about 6.3 million pieces were transported in three months. The number of pieces sold, on average, in April, was 500,000 to 600,000 pieces in Zhoucun, Shandong Province, 300,000 pieces in Gaoyang, Hebei Province, 300,000 to 400,000 pieces in Tianjin, 50,000 to 100,000 pieces in Beiping and its suburbs, and 21,000 pieces in Shanghai. In total, 1.2 million pieces were sold in two months. The remaining approximately 3 million pieces can still be sold for two months based on previous figures. Currently, it is the off-season for rayon sales. If they are to be completely sold out, it will be around the end of July. Therefore, various goods are stockpiled in Tianjin and cannot be sold off for the time being. Smugglers have had to change their plans and seek other options. The increasing imports and strong sales of petroleum are one proof of this. It is said that in half a month, 20,000 boxes were transported from the pseudo-Jidong region to Tianjin. 6,000 boxes remain in Nandasi and Beidaihe. The selling price per box in Tianjin has risen from more than 6 yuan to 7.2 yuan, which is more than 1 yuan cheaper than Mobil and Asiatic kerosene. The goods are sold as soon as they arrive, and there is a situation of demand exceeding supply. The selling price of Dalian kerosene per box is 3.7 yuan. Adding transportation costs, the cost of smuggled goods to Tianjin is 4.8 yuan, with a net profit of more than 1.4 yuan. Smugglers are constantly on the road. At the same time, British and American oil merchants are also feeling the greatest panic.</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, since March of this year, the transport of smuggled goods has been booming, and legitimate shipping companies have been affected. Because vagrant goods are mostly transported by civilian ships or steamships, or sometimes transported by Japanese ships, the domestic shipping companies operating on the Yingkou, Dalian, and Andong lines have had to reduce their ship schedules in order to reduce losses. Furthermore, the Tianjin-Yingkou route is restricted by the puppet Manchukuo. Ships sailing to Yingkou must be registered with the puppet Ministry of Transportation and recognized as having Manchukuo nationality, otherwise they are only allowed to load legitimate cargo, and even passengers are not allowed to be carried. This year, there are more passengers leaving the customs than in previous years, and passenger fares are very high. Domestic shipping companies had intended to rely on this to supplement their revenue, but they have been restricted. The future of their business is very worrying. (25th)</p>

<p>The county prison is overcrowded with opium offenders. Several have died of illness. A provincial order to streamline cases was previously received, but the actual situation has not been addressed. County Magistrate Li, seeing this situation, felt compassionate and, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by staff members Zhu Rongli, Section Chief Feng, Bureau Chief He, and Secretary Shen, brought case files and personally went to the prison to summon each detained opium offender for detailed questioning in order to distinguish and streamline cases and avoid innocent people being implicated. At the same time, he instructed prison officials to quickly open several new cells to be places for treating sick opium offenders. The questioning was completed at 12:00 p.m. and he will select minor offenders for parole. At 1:00 p.m., he gathered representatives from various hospitals to discuss improving the prison's sanitation facilities and accompanied the doctors to inspect the prison and provide free treatment to sick inmates. However, it is feared that the poor without guarantors will still inevitably become wronged souls in the black registers.</p>

They looted a considerable amount of jewelry, rice, clothing, and other items, worth approximately over a thousand yuan. After about three hours, the bandits fled towards the Wusong River. Afterwards, the victims, fearing revenge from the bandits, did not report the case to the county to request an arrest.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Suzhou: Impersonating Anti-Smuggling to Rob Boats <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the reports of smuggling in North China, the term "anti-smuggling" has repeatedly appeared in the news. Unexpectedly, anti-smuggling has not yet been effectively implemented, but armed robberies have already occurred at the border between Wuxian and Wujiang counties under the guise of "anti-smuggling." It is reported that Ms. Wu Zhiqing, a female employee working at the Wujiang Farmers Bank, traveled by boat with her mother, female servant from Suzhou to Pingwang, her original home, on the 26th. When the boat passed near Yinshan Bridge at the border between Wuxian and Wujiang counties, a group of people (several of whom were armed), resembling public officials and wearing badges, suddenly appeared, claiming to be ordered to conduct anti-smuggling operations and ordered the boat to stop for inspection. The boat immediately docked. The men boarded the boat and carried out a search, but found no prohibited items. They then robbed about over a hundred yuan in gold jewelry and silver dollars. At the same time, they also inspected several other passing boats, but found nothing. After about an hour, they allowed Wu Zhiqing's boat to leave, and the men disappeared. Afterwards, Wu Zhiqing realized that they were impersonating officials to rob. Upon arriving in Wujiang, she reported the incident to the local water and land police. Zhou Weilie, the water police district chief, upon receiving the report from the Wujiang detachment on the 27th, in addition to strictly investigating, also dispatched patrol boats to patrol the Yinshan and Guoxiang area to prevent accidents and maintain water security.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Request for Investigation of Embezzlement of Public Funds Case <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jingbo, the former director of the Wuxian County Land Tax Collection Office, was accused of corruption. After a thorough investigation by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, it was confirmed that there were indeed corrupt practices. He has been ordered to hand over 18,000 yuan, the proceeds of his corruption from the "Disaster Relief Item" of the 21st year. Now, the Ministry of Finance, considering that Zhu has been in office for eight years, in addition to the 21st year which has been investigated, there are other years when he handled "Mangcao" (grain transportation); whether there are any corrupt practices has not yet been investigated. Therefore, it has ordered the county to continue to investigate in detail and report, so that it can be verified and handled. Recently, it was discovered that Cha Yueshou, a senior official in Wujing, is Zhu Jingbo's prison brother-in-law. Taking advantage of his power, he and Zhu jointly embezzled several thousands of dollars in accumulated rent from the public land of the Cangchu Si, which was managed by Cha. There is also suspicion of illegally selling public land and houses. Many of the initiators who purchased the public land, such as Yu and Wang, submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Supervisory Office on the 27th, requesting a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The pork business in the county has two kinds of taxes: the slaughter tax and the meat donation. Since the establishment of the Donation and Tax Management Committee, the meat donation has been considered harsh and petty, and it was abolished by provincial order. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, based on the Ministry's order, stated that the slaughter tax refers to the entire pig. If it is sold to the workshops and markets, and retailed in pieces, this is called commercial operation, and business tax should be paid according to the percentage regulations for other goods. Director Jin of the County Business Tax Bureau, after receiving the order, first gathered the pork merchants in the city and suburbs to inquire about the amount of each business turnover and determine the lightness or heaviness of the tax rate. At first, the pork merchants did not have any objections. Afterwards, they suddenly unanimously opposed it and, starting on the 26th, agreed to suspend operations for three days as a form of resistance. Each pork stall posted a rectangular strip that read: "Pork prices are high, business losses, operations suspended for three days, public discussion to raise prices." In order to resolve the situation, it is heard that the matter will ultimately be resolved by raising prices.</p>

The loss is estimated at about five or six thousand dollars. It is heard that the cause of the fire was an electrical short circuit.</p>

<p>A smuggled cargo ship seized in the waters of Lusi, containing twenty-one large packages of rayon, was escorted on the 26th by the Third District Water Police Department, together with the two detained Chinese men, Wang Zhengwei and Li Wengao, to the Nantong District Commissioner's Office. The case involved four unlicensed Japanese men, including Yamasaki, who are still being guarded by police in Room 52 of the Chonghai Hotel. Chu, a military judge of the Commissioner's Office, went to the hotel at 4:00 p.m. to question Yamasaki and others.

<p>The amount of the small loan program for the banking industry here was originally set at 190,000 yuan. Afterwards, borrowers were enthusiastic, and the amount of the loan exceeded the budget, so that it was not possible to provide universal relief. In addition, the number of households that were disqualified due to unqualified inspections or guarantee problems was as high as 104, which was quite dissatisfactory to all industries. Representatives from various industries have been negotiating with Yu, a member of the Guarantee and Credit Committee, for days, asking the Guarantee and Credit Committee to temporarily refrain from lending to borrowers who have already been approved for loans by the banking industry, and to process the cases of those who are guaranteeing and those who have been disqualified first, and then release the funds at the same time. Otherwise, the release of funds will be stopped. According to the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, if the disqualified households do not have guarantees, the entire committee is willing to provide financial guarantee. Furthermore, the Chamber of Commerce, believing that the small loan of 30,000 yuan is not enough to lend, contacted the banking industry to request an additional loan of 20,000 yuan for distribution. On the 26th, all the executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce jointly sent a letter to the banking industry association, requesting that loans be provided to all industry households to avoid discrimination and cause disputes.</p>

<p>Reading of the Eulogy</p>
<p>"On the twelfth day of the fifth month of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Hu Gong Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, passed away in Guangdong due to illness. Upon receiving the news in Shanghai, all our countrymen were filled with grief. Tracing back to the late Qing Dynasty, foreign invasions were frequent, and the people suffered greatly. The Aisin Gioro clan enslaved our Han Chinese, intensifying their oppression. With his extraordinary talent, Gong embarked on the path of martial prowess, assisting Premier Sun in his travels abroad, rallying comrades, loudly proclaiming, and promoting revolution. In numerous uprisings, Gong participated in the planning and execution. Although facing repeated failures, Gong's determination never wavered. In the Revolution of 1911, the Manchu dynasty was overthrown, and the Republic was established. Gong's contribution was paramount. Gong then relinquished honor and privilege, retiring after achieving success. Alas, Heaven did not favor China. First, Yuan Shikai usurped power, and the imperial system was revived. Then, warlords carved up the country, causing widespread suffering. Public indignation grew, and Gong once again followed Premier Sun, engaging in revolution. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Gong held key positions, but eventually, due to the strain on his health, he retired to the south, embarking on a long voyage, hoping to rest and prolong his years. However, the national crisis deepened daily, and the central government relied heavily on him. Gong, adhering to his original intention of sacrificing himself to save the country, had no choice but to return and shoulder heavy responsibilities. How could we have foreseen that Heaven would not grant him long life, and his fortune would be cut short? A great man has fallen, and a pillar has collapsed. Alas, alas! Our Shanghai public organizations, upon receiving orders, convened a memorial meeting on May 25th. We, being among the last to participate, deeply moved by his merits and virtues, offer this eulogy, saying: How sad that illness could not be overcome, that a pillar of the nation has fallen and Gong has departed! As the state of the nation deteriorates daily, who will offer solutions? Heaven has not left us an heir, and our hearts are filled with sorrow. Born a hero, may your spirit rest in peace. Bless our country and benefit our people. If the netherworld can be stirred, it will be moved by our words. Alas, alas!" Respectfully eulogized by all directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Municipal Education Association.</p>
<p>Civic Memorial</p>
<p>The civic representatives' memorial was held at 2:00 PM. Initially, it was led by the First Special District Civic Association, with representatives from the district branches of the First Special District, totaling over a hundred people. Lai presided over the memorial (represented by Qian Longzhang), with Hu Fengxiang and Zhang Yicheng as assistant officiants. Cao Zhigong read the memorial address, Chen Jiufeng served as the master of ceremonies, and Zhang Xianfang and Xing Guxiang provided hospitality. Subsequently, it was led by the Second Special District Civic Association, with representatives from the district branches of the Second Special District, totaling over a hundred people. Huang Xianggu presided over the memorial, with Mao Yun and Jing Yan as assistant officiants. Shang Mujiang read the memorial address, and Wu Shouliang served as the master of ceremonies. The two memorial addresses are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Memorial Address</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai First Special District Civic Federation, leading the district branches and all citizens, respectfully presents this sacrifice of pure wine and simple dishes to the spirit of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, saying: Alas, born in Guangdong, our Gong was endowed with both intelligence and ambition. Assisting the Premier, he devoted his wisdom and loyalty, spreading revolution and awakening the masses. In numerous uprisings, the entire nation followed. In the Revolution of 1911, the nation was founded. Later, through chaos and usurpation, he fought against Yuan Shikai to protect the Constitution, persevering to the end. When the Premier went north, he held the south. During the Northern Expedition, he planned the military strategy. Establishing the capital in Nanjing, he served day and night, combating corruption and establishing a clean administration. As foreign insults grew daily and the national crisis deepened, he traveled far overseas, his heart filled with anxiety. Returning quickly, he worked together to overcome difficulties. When he fell ill in Hong Kong and Guangdong, his arguments were sharp, pointing out advantages and disadvantages, awakening the masses. How could we have known that the sudden news of his death would bring mourning to the nation? Compatriots across the seas are united in grief. Mr. Hu's legacy is the great unity of our cause. We, who live on, must follow his example. Alas, may you be pleased with this offering.</p>
<p>Second Memorial Address</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Second Special District Civic Federation, along with all directors and leading all citizens of the district, respectfully presents this sacrifice of pure wine and simple dishes to the spirit of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman, saying: Alas, Mr. Hu, an outstanding figure from Lingnan, whose virtue and writing are admired by all. Embracing our cause, he led the people. For over thirty years, he devoted himself to revolution, following the Premier and assisting in government. His great achievements are recorded in history. His fortitude and integrity are admired by all. He took on the difficult task of legislating and establishing institutions. In his conduct, he was strict with himself and treated others with respect. Eliminating corruption, his righteousness will endure forever. Alas, Mr. Hu, the national crisis deepens daily. Like boars and snakes, enemies are devouring our nation. We hoped to unite and resist the enemy, to restore our homeland and save our people. But alas, a great man has fallen. The mountains have collapsed, the trees have fallen, the beams have broken, and the pillars have crumbled. The party has lost its guide, and the nation has lost a great hero. The news of this tragedy has shocked the nation. We offer this sacrifice in the wind, filled with unspeakable sorrow. May your spirit descend and accept this offering.</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Concludes</p>
<p>Yesterday, those who came to pay their respects continued from noon until dusk, numbering approximately over a thousand people. After 3:00 PM, preparatory committee staff members Wang Xiaoyai and Xu Guozhi, among others, led groups to pay respects in batches every fifteen minutes, ceasing after 6:00 PM. The memorial service received over a thousand wreaths, plain streamers, floral rings, and flower baskets sent by various organizations, groups, schools, and individuals in this city. The Shanghai China Stone Company presented a large incense burner made of Shandong Laoshan fossils, engraved with the four characters "功在民族" (Merit in the Nation), of considerable value. The public memorial service for Chairman Hu lasted for three days, with over twenty thousand people paying their respects. The preparatory committee concluded its work yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM and is scheduled to handle the closing matters today, transferring all wreaths, floral rings, and related items to the funeral office on Gao'en Road. It is reported that the funeral office is also scheduled to hold its third plenary meeting of the preparatory committee this afternoon to discuss Chairman Hu's state funeral and to appoint the future responsible personnel of the funeral office.</p>
<p>Maritime Workers' Memorial</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch and the Seamen's Union held a memorial service for Chairman Hu at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Seamen's Party Branch on Zhaojiabang Road in the old city. Over eight hundred representatives from the Seamen's Party Branch, the Security Office, and labor organizations attended the meeting. Chairman Yang Hu reported, stating: "Comrades, today the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch and the Chinese Seamen's Union are leading various seamen's organizations in holding this memorial service for Chairman Hu Zhantang. Mr. Hu's noble morality and profound knowledge make him a model for us comrades. He dedicated his entire ability to the party and the nation, existing and perishing with them. Mr. Hu treated people with great kindness and was strict with himself, demonstrating his morality. He can be said to be full of valuable and glorious history, admired by nations around the world. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and the nation is in crisis, unexpectedly, a pillar of the party and the nation suddenly passed away. This is not only a loss for our party, but also a loss for the entire nation. Although Mr. Hu has passed away, his unfinished aspirations have been entrusted to all of our party members. Therefore, comrades of our party should follow Mr. Hu's revolutionary spirit and great personality, follow Premier Sun's teachings, and strive diligently, making sure to correct past mistakes. We hope that all comrades can be self-reliant, united in spirit, and revitalize the nation, so as not to betray the meaning of today's memorial for Mr. Hu." After the chairman's report, Secretary Li Zhengqiu, Wang Jiyi, and others successively delivered speeches (details omitted). Then, Wang Xiaoyai from the funeral office stationed in Shanghai delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Collection of Memorial Addresses</p>
<p>Memorial Address from the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch and the Chinese Seamen's Union, etc.: "On the twenty-seventh day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch and the Chinese Seamen's Union, etc., leading all Chinese seamen's unions, etc., respectfully offer flowers and seasonal fruits to the spirit of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and offer this memorial address, saying: Alas, in Lingbiao, the essence of nature converges. The waters flow vast, and the mountains stand tall. You were born with exceptional intelligence and wisdom. Since following the Premier, you have been like the North Star, determined to follow no other, studying diligently and cultivating yourself. Like Confucius on the left, you transmitted the purest essence, and you also possessed writing that shone like the Big Dipper. You also possessed courage, wielding spears and halberds. Since the Revolution of 1911, you have provided excellent counsel. Since 1913, you have devoted yourself to planning. As for reorganizing the party, you have made many unique plans. You created laws and regulations, like Yang and He. You controlled all officials, harmonizing all affairs. You even had time for writing, which was also outstanding. Formerly, due to illness, you extended your voyage on a small boat. Now, having recovered slightly, you spoke of returning. The country's path is difficult, and we all hope to proclaim our intentions. The people looked forward to prosperity, and everyone sang your praises. How could we have expected that in Guangdong, the precious cup would suddenly shatter, causing grief in thousands of tombs and pain throughout the nation? Alas, our Gong, you can last for thousands of years, but who will care for us, the common people? Who will deeply worry about the overseas Chinese who are being oppressed? Unable to find a solution, we mourn for our position. Gazing afar at the spirit banner, we respectfully pour three cups. If your spirit has knowledge, look upon the people as children, protect them with wind and clouds, and let your thunder resound. We, the people, cannot name you, but we will carry on your legacy. May our nation not be destroyed or shattered. We offer this sacrifice with sincerity. May your spirit come and accept it. Alas, may you be pleased with this offering." Memorial Address from all Party Members of the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch: "On the twenty-seventh day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch, represented by Special Commissioner Sheng Hu, leading all seamen party members, respectfully offers clean sacrifices and simple dishes to the spirit of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, saying: Alas, Gong, you lived for fifty-eight years. From the time you were conscious until your last breath, you embraced one set of ideas and never abandoned them for a single day. Tracing the flow of the Shu and Si rivers, you still wanted to take You Ruo as your teacher. Only your belief in the Dao was sincere and your self-knowledge was clear. You could directly follow Boyi of the East Sea. When the Qing government was corrupt, you wanted to save the nation and act on your own. You raised the sword to proclaim justice, even if it meant touching the nets and ropes. Knowing that restoring the Han was impossible through conquest, you personally planned the campaign in Zhennan with the cavalry of Guangzhou. In 1911, you used chopsticks to plan, and in 1913, you exerted yourself to drive the carriage. Setting the strategy of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, the party's lineage has been able to continue to this day. You once 三章之是 and lived as a head of state without selfishness. Summarizing your life's ambitions and actions, all were pure and heartfelt. For four or five years, you were in Beijing, never leaving the country even a step. You enacted laws and regulations for several years, and you personally attended the gatherings. Gathering the great achievements of the people's thoughts, you were not swayed and your own ideas were respected. Seeing the wholeness of your books, one can know the existence of your nature. Truly, the righteous qi of heaven and earth, regulates the sun and moon to be dawn and dusk. How could we have expected a thunderbolt from the clear sky to suddenly return your cloud carriage? Thinking of the national crisis, we feel more pain. Looking up to the vastness of your qi, we sigh for a long time. We offer sacrifices from afar at the mountains, thinking of your face and feeling spiritually hurt. After presenting the words and offering the wine, your spirit seems to come and taste it. Alas, may you be pleased with this offering."</p>
<p>Two-Route Memorial</p>
<p>The Special Party Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and the Two-Route Bureau held a memorial service yesterday for Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman, in the auditorium of the party branch. All arrangements in the venue were extremely solemn. In the center of the auditorium hung a portrait of Chairman Hu, crowned with the party emblem, surrounded by fresh flowers on both sides. Wreaths and elegiac couplets from the party branch, the bureau, the union, and various district branches were arranged on the left and right. The party branch committee members and the bureau director walked into the auditorium, and over five hundred participating representatives were arranged on the left and right sides of the auditorium. The presidium consisted of party branch committee members Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Song Fuji, bureau director Huang Boqiao, and Lin Zezeng, union directors Zhao Yu, Yuan Qiaofu, and seven others. First, Chen Chengshi of the presidium read the Premier's will. Then, Song Fuji of the party branch and Lin Zezeng of the bureau presented wreaths. Li Dasan of the presidium read the memorial address. Huang Boqiao of the presidium reported on Chairman Hu's revolutionary deeds and the significance of the memorial, stating that Chairman Hu had been very studious in his youth. When the Premier was promoting revolution in Japan, Chairman Hu had a profound belief in the Three Principles of the People and could be called the most loyal believer in the Three Principles of the People. The greatness of his spirit lay in: 1. He could not be moved by poverty and lowliness; 2. He could not be subdued by power and force; 3. He could not be corrupted by treasures. He could be called a great man, and his character was upright and his integrity was clean. He engaged in revolution for more than thirty years, never refusing hardship and never avoiding complaints. This kind of great spirit and perseverance was the foundation for creating a revolutionary society. Today, we commemorate Chairman Hu, and we should emulate Chairman Hu's integrity, be of one mind and one heart, be loyal and brave, and devote ourselves to self-reliance and resolving the national crisis, etc. Then, Liang Shilin and others delivered speeches in succession (details omitted). Finally, a group photo was taken and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Memorial Lament</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Special Party Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Administration Bureau, the Union, and various Rotary elementary schools, employee schools, and various groups, etc., respectfully offer condolences to the spirit of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and offer this lament, saying: Oh, Mr. Hu, you revealed your talent early, dedicated yourself to revolution, and possessed a spirit that encompassed rivers and mountains. Following the Premier, you held the Three Principles of the People as your own. You shouldered great responsibilities and grieved for the world and pitied the people. With blue blood and yellow flowers, you rose up in revolt, first in Wuchang and Hanyang, then continuing your efforts, eradicating the imperial system and restoring the nation. You suppressed evil and rebellion, assisting day and night, acting as a pillar in the south and intimidating the traitor Yuan. You were loyal to the party and the nation, unyielding and unwavering. You revitalized our party and vowed to launch the Northern Expedition. The Premier had aspirations, and you continued and expanded them. The great cause was accomplished, and the nation was unified. In the central legislative body, you were admired by the people. Embarking on a raft and floating on the sea, you went on a long journey of ten thousand miles. You returned to eastern Guangdong, uniting your spirit and sincerity. The nation faces many difficulties, and good people are relied upon. Alas, Heaven is unjust, and a great man has passed away. The party has lost a loyal backbone, and the nation has lost a senior leader. The pillar has broken, and the mountain has collapsed. The sea swallows up the sound. Your spirit is immortal, and your example is not distant. Following in your footsteps, the responsibility lies with us, and we dare not forget. We offer incense and flowers in mourning, as if your spirit is present. Alas, may you be pleased with this offering.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Customs Brokers' Union Requests Elimination of Transit Tax <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Customs Brokers' Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, stating: "The customs brokerage industry relies entirely on transportation, and the key to transportation lies in shipping. Therefore, the prosperity of the customs brokerage industry is always seen as dependent on the success or failure of the shipping industry. Although the businesses are different, the relationship is extremely close, with only direct and indirect connections being the difference. Since the Ministry implemented combined water and land transportation, shipping of goods by ship has gradually decreased. The reason for this is that goods transported by private boats, railways, and postal packages, whether to inland ports or treaty ports, are uniformly tax-exempt with government approval. However, goods transported by ships are only exempt from taxes when traveling from inland areas to treaty ports. For goods transported between treaty ports, transit taxes must still be paid. As a result, in order to avoid transit taxes and reduce costs, both cargo and passengers reject ships and opt for trains, sailboats, or postal services. Consequently, ship cargo has decreased, and our industry is also declining. Your Ministry is promoting the transportation industry, and ships, railways, postal services, and private boats should all be taken into consideration. However, national tax revenue should be reformed, and uniform treatment should be given. At a time when the circulation and transportation of domestic products are being promoted, shipping taxes should be exempted. Otherwise, the cargo of ships will decline further, and our government will inevitably overlook this and lose that, which is lacking in the purpose of emphasizing both water and land transportation. Moreover, the domestic railway development is not yet complete. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has already opened to traffic, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is about to be completed. In the future, railways and highways will be accessible in all directions. If the transit tax is not abolished quickly, ship cargo will inevitably disappear. With the failure of shipping, the vitality of our industry will also be exhausted. Recently, it has been heard that the shipping industry has repeatedly appealed to your Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. Although permission has been granted for abolition, no clear implementation order has been seen. Our industry is extremely anxious for the sake of livelihood and future prospects. Member associations have repeatedly requested the elimination of transit taxes, hoping for early implementation to make up for the losses. Therefore, we dare to report the situation and earnestly request you to quickly urge the Ministry of Finance to issue a clear order for abolition, so as to equalize treatment and alleviate business difficulties. We await your orders with trepidation. Sincerely, Chen Panjun, Standing Committee Member and Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping and Customs Brokers' Association."</p>
<h3 id="e106">French Silk Industry Association Requests Implementation of Raw Silk Grading and Inspection; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders the Bureau of Inspection and Testing to Prepare <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The export of raw silk from our country is equally important to France and the United States. As proof, the output of Shanghai silk factories to France and the United States was 20,000 packages each last year. However, in the past, sales in France were greater than in the United States. In recent years, due to competition from Japanese silk in France, Chinese silk has plummeted in value. The prices of Japanese silk and Chinese silk are similar, but because Japanese silk is of uniform quality and convenient to purchase, it surpasses Chinese silk. Yesterday, the Shanghai Raw Silk Exporters' Association received a letter from the Lyon Silk Industry Association of France, stating that France has always welcomed Chinese silk, and general weaving houses are very willing to purchase it. However, in recent years, Japanese silk has encroached on the Chinese silk market, and sales of Chinese silk in France have decreased year by year. Although there are many reasons for this, the main one is that the Japanese government has formulated grades and conducted strict inspections. Therefore, the quality of Japanese silk is uniform and unified, making transactions very convenient in the French market. When purchasing Japanese silk, it is not necessary to ask about the brand name. It is only a way to identify a batch of raw silk, not a standard for its grade. Therefore, this association specifically writes to your association, requesting the Chinese government to formulate Chinese silk grades and stipulate quality standards for each grade. These standards must be similar to those of Japanese silk, so that France can still compete to purchase Chinese silk, and the French market will not be completely seized by Japan. In addition, the raw silk cohesion test should be implemented in accordance with the methods of the Japanese inspection agency by the Chinese government inspection agency. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau to prepare for the implementation of raw silk grading and inspection. It is expected that it will be opened around the autumn of this year, which is truly good news for the foreign trade of raw silk.</p>
<h3 id="e107">New Life Movement Association Requests Organization of Labor Service Corps, Creating the Foundation of Modern National Obligatory Labor; Establishment Required Within One Month, Service to Commence Two Weeks Later <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, holding labor as life's duty and service as life's vocation, organized Youth Service Corps at the beginning of the New Life Movement to carry out labor service in various districts on weekends and to persuade citizens to practice the New Life Movement, which achieved considerable results. However, in the past, the members of the organization were mostly local teams of students and youths, which was considered insufficient to promote the entire society and all sectors. Therefore, at the last executive committee meeting, in accordance with the regulations of the General Association, three kinds of "Regulations for the Shanghai Municipal Organs, Schools, and Social Organizations to Organize New Life Labor Service Corps" were formulated (the original Youth Service Corps will not be abolished for the time being), and the focus and purpose of its work were defined. This was intended to inform the public to take the lead, sparing no effort, and then to organize and educate the people in order to support public morale, improve society, and create the foundation of modern national obligatory labor. It is reported that the association has yesterday sent the above regulations, along with application charts and attachments, to various organs in the city and instructed its affiliated organs, middle schools, and social organizations, etc., to be informed and prepare in accordance with the regulations, that is, to complete the organization and establishment within one month and start service two weeks later. Any organs, schools, and social organizations in remote areas or working outside the city, if they have not received the notification and feel the need, can request a supplementary copy from their respective administrative organs or directly from the New Life Movement Association in Fenglin Bridge.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Actively Report Smuggled Goods <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Authority Granted by the Government, All Guilds Must Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all industry guilds yesterday regarding the prevention of the circulation of smuggled goods, stating that the Chamber had previously noted that smuggling in North China had a significant impact on merchants in the city and had issued letters to related industries to solicit prevention measures. Subsequently, it received replies from the cotton cloth industry and the woolen industry, which were forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for adoption. On the 26th of this month, it also received a letter from the Silk and Satin Industry Association stating that the industry was severely affected by smuggling in North China, especially artificial silk fabrics and artificial silk interwoven fabrics, with the most significant price differences. For example, the cost of smuggled dull silk per yard is less than twenty cents, while the cost of manufacturing in China is more than forty cents per yard. This is just one example, and the rest can be inferred. The price of each box of rayon in Japan is about one hundred yuan, while smuggled goods in North China are sold for only one hundred and seventy yuan. However, legally taxed goods in Shanghai need to pay more than two hundred and eighty yuan in taxes per box, plus a cost of one hundred yuan, so each box has to be sold for more than three hundred and eighty yuan. Therefore, the cost of raw materials differs by more than one time, resulting in the prevalence of smuggled goods. If no urgent measures are taken, domestic silk factories will face the risk of suspending production. Therefore, the association convened a temporary emergency meeting to discuss. It was generally agreed that effective ways to stop smuggling, before the central government protests have been made and stopped it, besides the severe cooperation from everywhere, should include a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to persuade all industries to monitor each other and refuse to purchase smuggled goods. If any secret purchases are discovered with concrete evidence, they should be secretly reported to the government for severe punishment, so that a warning can be given as a deterrent to those who seek illicit profits. The decision was made to reply to the letter accordingly. Now, due to the previous reasons, the impact of smuggling and the association’s views are presented in a letter. The Interim Regulations on the Inspection of Imported Goods and Transportation have been promulgated by the government. According to Article 17 of the regulations, all industry guilds are responsible for reporting tax evasion and smuggled goods and are entitled to rewards. The Silk and Satin Industry Association's so-called monitoring and secret reporting are already stipulated in the Interim Regulations. As a group of legitimate merchants, each guild should pay close attention to this rampant smuggling, which is a matter of vital interest, and act in accordance with the authority granted by the government, report the facts truthfully at any time, and help the country's economy and people's livelihood from deteriorating. Do not give up slightly, this is our hope.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Tea Exports Suddenly Suffer Setback; Opening Extended to Friday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Two Measures Proposed by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Marketing Office Has Responded</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, after the Qimen black tea samples were distributed to foreign firms by the Marketing Office, the foreign firms convened their colleagues to evaluate the tea. The original plan was to open the market for trading this Monday, but it was later rescheduled to 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, the foreign merchants suddenly proposed two conditions yesterday morning: 1. The Marketing Office must find a bank to guarantee that the tea transaction is successful and that the goods match the samples; 2. The Marketing Office must specify the intermediaries for transactions with tea merchants. As a result, a setback occurred, and the opening was suddenly suspended. It is reported that the Marketing Office has now responded to these two measures. First, the Marketing Office will find the Bank of Communications to provide a guarantee for the goods worth less than 100,000, and stipulate that if any discrepancies are found between the goods and samples within eight months after the transaction is successful, the guarantor will compensate or refund the price. The second measure is currently being selected, and both parties have agreed to open the market this Friday (the 29th) without further delay. It is expected that the implementation of tea transactions will open a new situation. It is also learned that foreign tea merchants are now expressing their willingness to cooperate sincerely with the Marketing Office. Hong Mengpan, chairman of the Tea Industry Association, and Chen Yizhou, manager of Zhongxin Chang, are willing to cooperate to jointly plan methods to promote tea sales.</p>

<p>Tatsuo Kawai Transferred from Guangzhou to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency on the 27th, Consul-General Ishii in Shanghai has been promoted to Ambassador to Siam due to a reshuffle in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His successor as Consul-General has been decided to be Tatsuo Kawai, the Consul-General in Guangzhou, and the formal appointment will be made at the cabinet meeting on the 29th.</p>

<p>Article 3, Item E</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Barenson, Commissioner of Customs, specially issued a joint proclamation on the revision of Article 3, Item E of the Rules for Vessels' Import and Export Manifests: It is hereby announced that the Rules for Vessels' Import and Export Manifests have been posted in the Customs Notice No. 1384. It is now ordered by the Ministry of Finance to revise Article 3 (E) of the aforementioned Rules as follows: (E) If a vessel imports from overseas, in addition to detailing the above four items (A, B, C, and D) in the hatch list, the weight and dimensions of each piece of cargo on board should be detailed, and the names of each consignee should be entered in the hatch list according to the bill of lading or package receipt. If the name of the consignee is not listed in the bill of lading or receipt, it should also be noted in the hatch list. However, if the shipping manifest prepared at the foreign port of shipment lists the weight and dimensions of each piece of cargo, this shipping manifest may be attached to the hatch list to avoid separate filling. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Japanese Merchants Plan to Establish a Goods Market <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Organization Similar to an Exchange</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Cables Shanghai Municipal Government to Investigate and Reply</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, there are currently five exchanges in Shanghai: the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Yarn Exchange, the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange, the Grain Exchange, the Gold Exchange, and the Flour Exchange. The Ministry of Finance has sent supervisors to oversee the operations of each exchange. Now, Japanese merchants in Shanghai are planning to establish a goods exchange in Shanghai (i.e., a trading center) that includes cotton yarn, grains, flour, etc., under the name of "Shanghai Goods Market" and registered with the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai. In reality, it is a disguised exchange with a preparation office located at No. 15, Route des Soeurs.</p>
<p>All Sectors Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Cotton Yarn, Grain, and Flour Exchanges, as well as various industrial sectors, are paying close attention to the event of Japanese merchants establishing a goods market. They believe that if the goods market is a disguised exchange, it should be banned by law. However, before the contents of the market's operations are formally announced, they have not yet expressed their views. A Nanjing telegram stated that the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Yarn Exchange has telegraphed the Ministries of Finance and Industry to seek ways to prevent it. According to Mr. Mu Ouchu, the chairman of the Exchange, what the newspaper wrote is not factual.</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Investigation and Reply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving reports that Japanese merchants are planning to organize a goods exchange in Shanghai, specially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to quickly investigate and report back for review. The goods market has established a preparation office and is currently actively preparing. The persons in charge are Chinese citizens, Lu Zhisheng and Tan Haiqiu. However, according to Tan and Lu, who spoke to reporters from the New Voice News Agency, the organizers are Japanese merchants residing in Shanghai, and they are only assisting on their behalf.</p>

<p>Stranded Due to Rising Water and Heavy Fog</p>
<p>Construction-Aid Ships Sent and Military Police Dispatched</p>
<p>The Jiangyu, a steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a deadweight of 3,084 tons, a registered tonnage of 2,262 tons, a length of 300 feet, a width of 42 feet 3 inches, a draft of blank 　feet, a loaded draft of 11 feet 8 inches, a horsepower of 1,750, and a speed of 12 knots per hour, has a cargo hold capacity of 116,012 cubic feet. It has 10 first-class cabins, 32 second-class cabins, 96 second-class berths, 178 third-class berths, and unlimited open berths. It was built in 1883. It departed on the afternoon of the 26th and arrived above Jiujiang at</p>
<p>Downstream of Huangshigang</p>
<p>Two nautical miles away, it encountered heavy fog, making it difficult to distinguish the river surface. Recently, with the rising water, the shallow banks along the river have also been submerged, making it even harder to recognize. Due to the negligence of the pilot, it mistakenly entered the area and ran aground suddenly. The shipowner, Huang Honglai, wanted to reverse to get out of the shoal, but he was unable to do so, so he sent a telegram to</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hankou for Help</p>
<p>The Hankou branch received the report and immediately planned to send the Lijie steamer to rescue it. At the same time, it telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, stating that the Jiangyu steamer was stranded in a very bad location, and the ship was stuck in the shoal, making the situation very dangerous. It urgently requested that all steamers navigating upstream and downstream of the river provide assistance. Currently, the Jianguo steamer has gone to tow it. Moreover, the area is a troubled area with bandits, making the Jiangyu's grounding even more dangerous. The Hankou branch has requested that local armed military police be sent to the area to protect the ship to prevent accidents, while rescue operations are underway. The headquarters, upon receiving the report, telegraphed the Hankou and Xunyang branches and all Yangtze River steamers yesterday afternoon to find ways to assist in the rescue. It is noted that there were no passengers on board the Jiangyu steamer.</p>

<p>Postal Workers' Federation</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Federation telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to request the Central Government to increase the number of representatives of special trade unions to the National Assembly. The telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the Department of Mass Training, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan: We are deeply disturbed that the annex to the National Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan does not include representatives from the special trade unions of postal, telecommunications, railway, and maritime workers. According to Article 19 of the Election Law, our special trade unions of postal, telecommunications, railway, and maritime workers have not been listed among the professional groups because the government has not yet promulgated special trade union laws that meet practical needs. However, the associations of special trade unions are spread throughout the country, with a large number of members, and they all have a glorious history and sound organization. The National Assembly Representative Election issue is related to the vital interests of hundreds of thousands of people. It seems that we cannot rashly disregard the facts, deprive them of their rights, and exclude them. Therefore, in the National Assembly Representative Election Law, our special trade unions of postal, telecommunications, railway, and maritime workers should be recognized as legitimate professional groups, each with the right to participate in the election of representatives. Secondly, the professional elections stipulated in the National Assembly Representative Election Law are not only subject to regional restrictions, but also only divide the professional categories into three types of representatives: agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the number is extremely small. Taking the trade union item as an example, in the Shanghai area alone, there are hundreds of professional categories, and the purposes and interests of each industry are different. If the regulations of the election law are followed, the representatives produced, although nominally professional representatives, cannot actually represent any profession. If the members of special trade unions such as postal, telecommunications, railway, and maritime workers are engaged in a national unified professional with their own special interests and purposes, they should not participate in the professional elections which are only nominally there, and should request that each special trade union such as postal, telecommunications, railway, and maritime workers be an election unit, not subject to regional restrictions, and the number of representatives should be determined according to the proportion of the number of people, so as to implement the spirit of the professional representative system, and that is beneficial to the country. It concerns the rights of hundreds of thousands of transport workers, so it is requested to review and approve it, and quickly order it to be revised and implemented, which is really convenient.

<p>Maritime and Land Party Workers</p>
<p>The Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union jointly petitioned the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, the Central Organization Department, and the Central Department of Mass Training to increase the number of representatives from various special trade unions to the National Assembly. The original presentation is recorded below: "The case of increasing the number of representatives from special trade unions to the National Assembly has been previously presented to your association (department) by our party department and union, as well as the Special Party Department of the Pinghan Railway. Now, our party department and union, due to the frequent letters and telegrams from various seamen's and railway workers' groups, and many representatives have been sent to appeal, requesting to send personnel to lead them to the capital to petition your association (department) and the National Government to fight for the issue of the number of national representatives of special trade unions. Considering the urgency of the situation, and not yet receiving the definite measures of the instructions from your association (department), on the 22nd of this month, a joint symposium of the party departments of various special trade unions was held at the Chinese Seamen's Union. It was decided that 'representatives of the party departments and unions of seamen and railway workers across the country will be jointly organized to go to Beijing on a regular basis to petition your association (department) and the National Government to increase the number of representatives of special trade unions to the National Assembly, and the various agencies present will jointly submit to your association (department) first,' etc., are recorded. The case involves the political power of most workers and the legislative plan of the Party and the country, which is very important. According to the principle of the National Assembly Representative Election Law decided by your association (department) in the past, the fourth principle of 'professional groups take the group as the unit, without dividing into regions, and the distribution of the number is based on the number of members or business　standards,' and the recently promulgated annex to the National Representative Election Law, the trade unions are divided into provincial and municipal regions. Compared to the two, there are obvious discrepancies, disregarding our special trade unions with millions of transport workers. Whether in the principles of the law, the equal status of civil rights, and the legislative procedures of the central principles, it is not fair. Therefore, the workers are complaining and feeling really sympathetic. Furthermore, in terms of the indivisible integrity of the special trade unions and the mobility of members, it is indeed inconvenient to participate in the elections of several provinces and cities or to participate in the elections of a certain province and city as a whole. Moreover, the Election Law does not have any clear provisions on how our special trade unions should participate in the elections. Our central government has always attached importance to professional groups, especially our special trade unions, and is particularly concerned about them, so it is placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Party, and there is no reason to discriminate. The omissions and errors of the Legislative Yuan this time should be that the Ministry of Industry, based on the relationship of jurisdiction, did not pay attention to the professional groups directly under the Central Committee or special party departments. The village materials provided to the Legislative Yuan were already omitted, and the legislative gentlemen did not have time to make reference in a hurry, so this kind of error occurred. In summary, the mistakes, omissions, and obstacles that have already occurred in terms of principles, legislative principles and procedures, and practical difficulties should be amended according to the previous first column of revisions of the civil and criminal laws, and ask for the approval to present to the Standing Committee and to re-allocate the number of national representatives of our special trade unions according to the pre-ordered proportion in light of the expectations of millions of transport workers, so that it is absolutely impossible to make the excuse that the law 　has already been promulgated, causing most of our workers to lose political power. The urgent statement leaves no time to choose. In addition to presenting separately, I hope you will carefully examine and quickly approve it for the convenience of the Party."</p>
<p>Seafarers Branch</p>
<p>Seafarers and railways, various special trade unions, regarding the issue of requesting to increase the number of representatives to the National Assembly, have been vying to fight for the various situations from the government in recent days, all of which are recorded in previous newspapers. The Chinese Seamen's Union received a telegram from the Shanghai branch the day before yesterday, which read, "To Yang Junjian, Special Commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union, it is now approved to delete and replace the telegram from the Preparatory Committee of the Zhenjiang Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, stating that the right to vote is one of the people's political rights, and unless the provisions of Article 4 of the Election Law are violated, the right to vote that they should have cannot be arbitrarily deprived. The total number of employees in our Seamen's Union is tens of thousands. How can we exclude all of them? If we do not fight for this, it is no different from trapping ourselves. We should ask the real society to unite and fight hard, and we will not stop until the purpose of increasing the number is achieved, etc. Based on this, it is verified that the Seamen's Union is a formally legally binding party, and it is also a central government organization directly under the central government. The number of seamen is large, and it is of course impossible to participate in provincial and municipal elections. However, the General Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan does not have clear regulations for the various specialized parties of the Seamen’s Union, the Postal and Telecommunications Union, and the Railway Union. The people are panicked, and they do not know what to do. The previous report is hereby approved, and a special telegram is sent to your office, forwarding a telegram to the central government, requesting an increase in the number of seafarer representatives, and there is no limit to the expectations. Koushou Yang of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union," etc. Also, the Wuhu Branch and Zhenjiang Branch of the Seamen's Union have all received requests from various seafarer representatives, and have forwarded them to the Association, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Committee for the clear provision of the number of seafarer national representatives, with the length of the words omitted. It is heard that the four institutions of the Chinese Seamen's Union's Seamen's Special Party Department and the Jinghu, Huhu, Hangzhou, and Yong Two-Way Special Party Departments and Two-Way Workers' Unions, in addition to jointly presenting to the Central Committee and telegraphing the various Seamen's Railway Party Department Unions to recommend representatives to go to Beijing to jointly petition before June 2, are now inviting legislative experts to study the omissions in the National Assembly Representative Election Law and print the petition reasons in order to send them to the Legislative Committee, each government authority, and each newspaper in Beijing when they go to Beijing to petition in order to gain public support and achieve the purpose of revising the National Representative Election Law and increasing the number of National Representatives of Special Trade Unions.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Five Academic Societies Joint Annual Meeting - Original Speech by Kong Xiangxi (Continued) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>However, in what areas should you all engage in national construction to be effective? I have a few ideas to briefly contribute to you all.</p>
<p>1.  Construction should be in line with China's national conditions. What are China's current national conditions? I believe you all already know. China today is a poor country, but it has vast land and abundant resources, clearly like a great treasure trove, but without the key to open it. Therefore, it can be said that China is poor but not truly poor. At the same time, it is also a weak country, but if China's four hundred million people can unite as one, then with everyone's will forming a fortress, it can also become a strong nation in the world. Therefore, it can also be said that China is weak but not truly weak. However, during this transitional period, if we plan to build up the country and restore its original strength, we must prescribe the right medicine. All construction must, first and foremost, be in line with the country's national conditions. Otherwise, we may bring in many things from foreign countries, and if we follow foreign conventions in everything, building everything in the same way, without considering our own financial resources, it would inevitably be ill-suited to the country's environment, and too far removed from the goal of saving the nation.</p>
<p>2.  Construction should be in line with current needs. A country's construction has countless aspects, especially when China's industry is backward. To align with the national conditions, it is necessary to pre-determine an overall plan. During construction, we must weigh the importance and set a priority among what is urgent and what is not. For example, we may see a Western-style building and find it magnificent, but if a family of five builds a Western-style building that can house twenty people, this is not practical. Previously, when I was in Japan, I saw the rain shelters built at Tokyo Station in Japan, which were very simple. The top was just a sheet of galvanized iron, and the bottom was just a few rough wooden posts. However, when it rained heavily, it could still provide shelter. Although it didn't cost much, it was still their own. Looking back at our country, when we arrive in Beiping, as soon as we get to the East Station, we see a very grand rain shelter, which feels very impressive, but it cost a lot of money, and it was all borrowed from foreign countries. So, as a result, the money earned by the railway can only be used to repay debts and cannot be used for development and improvement. In China in the past, there were countless situations like this. Therefore, I feel that people in the engineering field, in particular, should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>3.  Construction should be within our own capabilities. Traditionally, Chinese scholars often read dead books and were inflexible. Today's students studying abroad also inevitably make this mistake. Whatever they learn abroad, they use it entirely upon returning home. All the materials are bought from foreign countries. Not to mention that the annual outflow of money is very large, it is also a great pity that China's original raw materials are not researched and utilized. Now, construction must try to find domestic raw materials as much as possible, which not only aligns with the principles of the national economy but also yields practical uses. For example, the vegetable oil lamps used in China in the past had very small flames. After improvements, kerosene was used for lighting, which increased the flame. However, the glass covers of kerosene lamps are easily broken if one is not careful. Therefore, economical families do not use lamp covers. As a result, many poor families in Shanxi use lamps without glass covers, and later, many people developed groin sores due to kerosene poisoning. Only after medical research was this discovered. Therefore, when I was in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, I told their technical personnel to research and remodel vegetable oil lamps with glass covers, which would not only prevent the outflow of profits but also be harmless to the body. Later, indeed, Mr. Zhong and Xiao Hechang successfully experimented after a certain degree of testing. A few months ago, Mr. Xiao brought it to show me, and I was very happy to see that the light was very good. This is also a significant contribution to society. Also, China's medicinal materials have their own special strengths, but when they are eaten, even the residue is swallowed. In these areas, if we can conduct research and improve them, extract the residue and refine the essence, they would be just as fine as foreign medicines. Not only could they treat sick people, but they could also sustain the livelihoods of many people who collect and sell medicine, and reduce much outflow of money. For example, ephedrine and garlic essence are praised and readily adopted by foreigners. In my opinion, science only has ancient and modern, not Chinese and foreign. As long as we can integrate the old and new and connect everything, we will surely have great inventions. Today, it is a very good phenomenon that five academic societies can jointly hold an annual meeting, because Chinese people have always been self-centered and separate. Especially in academic fields, there are various systems and factions. Since ancient times, academic societies have either attacked each other or pointed fingers at each other. But today, there are societies like the Chinese Institute of Chemical Engineers and the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering, etc., that can unite together, be affectionate, and learn from each other. This is a very good phenomenon in Chinese academia. Originally, to do things, we must cooperate with each other, unite as one, and then we can achieve excellent results. For example, to build a house, the architect makes the design, the sanitary engineer installs sanitary equipment, and the civil engineer collects materials and hires labor. Only through mutual cooperation can this house be built. However, Chinese people have traditionally lacked this spirit of cooperation. Today, I am very pleased to see this good spirit. I hope you all will continue to work hard, continue to explore, and move forward together on the path of invention. I also feel that it is not impossible to take the strengths of others and discard our own weaknesses. Even if what China has invented over the past few decades is no longer very applicable, we can take the strengths of others, discard our own weaknesses, and strive to improve. This is also the path we should take. After studying other people's things, we can imitate them. Although we cannot catch up with them head-on, we can still be on par with them. Japan is the most capable of imitation. Now, when we look at the things invented in Japan, some may even surpass Europe and the United States. Things that Europe and the United States do not have may be invented in Japan. The United States is a scientifically advanced country, but Japanese goods are commonly seen in one or two-cent shops. Also, India is a British colony, but Japanese cloth can sell well in India. Furthermore, Lancashire and Manchester in England are the centers of the British cotton industry, and some say that the outer garments worn by the workers in the cotton mills are also Japanese goods. Although I have never seen it, it is said that this is indeed the case. We may ask, where does Japan's long-term progress come from? It comes from imitation. Being able to imitate others and promote the new by discarding the old is what has enabled Japan's industry to make such long-term progress. Therefore, I feel that although China may not be able to invent many things, it can also study and imitate the things invented by others. In addition to imitation, we must also improve. "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." When I was the Minister of Industry, I planned to try to establish a central machine factory to improve the machines used in Chinese handicrafts so that women in Chinese families could use these improved things to develop China's household industry. I think that you all sitting here today must have the same feelings as me, and I hope everyone will work hard as much as possible, because construction work can only be started from agriculture, industry, and commerce. Now, our country's exports are decreasing day by day, and our imports are increasing day by day, resulting in a huge trade deficit year after year, which has plunged the country into poverty. Now, if everyone wants to engage in construction, they must find ways to help agriculture, industry, and commerce. If we want to help agriculture, industry, and commerce, we must reduce imports and increase exports. Based on the points I just mentioned, I cannot help but have three hopes: In addition to invention, I also hope that we can imitate imported goods as much as possible and improve exported goods as much as possible. Then our country's raw materials can naturally be utilized, and our country's foreign trade can gradually develop. At the same time, we must pay attention to the conservation of financial and material resources, and make everything in line with economic principles, which would greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. I have said that saving the country does not necessarily mean becoming an official in the political arena to save the country. In fact, what is most important and most closely related to the country is not officials but inventors. If you can all concentrate on inventing various weapons of national defense, especially in the current critical situation of the country, it will be of great need and great help. Looking around the world, military weapons are changing with each passing day. This is the result of scientists racking their brains and burying themselves in hard work. But in China, nothing like this has been heard. Therefore, today I would like to reiterate this point and ask you all to pay more attention to it. Do not let the Qi Lu people who invented the breech-loading rifle be the only ones to be praised. However, invention must be done by people with considerable knowledge in order to achieve results. Among China's four hundred million people, I only hope that you all sitting here today, because you have considerable knowledge and considerable experience, and you also have considerable status in society. If everyone can consistently strengthen our will and embrace the spirit of hard work, hard work, and practical work, I believe that we will make a very great contribution to the country. Therefore, today, in my busy schedule, I took the time to participate in this grand meeting and contribute these few ideas. I hope everyone will pay attention to them. Although I spoke casually, it was entirely out of sincerity. I hope everyone can accept them and put them into practice. This would be of great help to our current nation and people, and it is also the greatest mission of this conference.</p>

<p>Only Over Ten Thousand People Have Renewed Their Licenses</p>
<p>The Inspection Team Is Intensifying Its Efforts to Investigate</p>
<p>According to the Public Security Bureau's announcement, the reporting of opium addiction in this city began on the 10th of this month. According to the person in charge of the Bureau's Smoker Registration Section, the reporting of opium addiction starts with propaganda and investigation. Recently, a propaganda team has been organized to go out and give lectures every day, so those who register as smokers and request to quit opium addiction are very enthusiastic. From the start of reporting to May 23rd, the number of people applying for ordinary licenses was 775, the number of people registering for poor people's licenses was 1164, and the number of people requesting to quit smoking was 358. At the same time, the deadline for smokers to renew their second-term licenses will be at the end of the month, but the number of people who have renewed their licenses is only 12,577. There are still a large number of registered smokers who have not renewed their licenses. Therefore, as the deadline approaches, the Bureau's Inspection Team has fully mobilized and gone to various branch bureaus and offices to supervise the police chiefs and investigate smokers in different ways, urging them to renew their licenses, especially in the areas with the most smokers, such as Lao Beimen and Jiumu Di, intensifying the investigation to ensure that ordinary smokers have nowhere to hide, and urging them to automatically go to renew their licenses in the last few days.</p>

<p>The Housing Problem Investigation Committee of the Public Concession held its first meeting on May 26th in the Municipal Council's Hearing Room. Municipal Council Director MacKnoden was elected as the Chairman of the Committee. Other committee members, such as Mrs. Xia Jinlin, Graham, Guo Chengen, Kuroda, and Pike, attended on time. Others present included Public Works Director Ha Pu, Incoming Public Works Director Jimson, Health Director Dr. Zordan, Factory Group Director Miss Xingde, and Municipal Council Director-General Si. After MacKnoden was elected as Chairman, the committee members began to discuss the procedures for conducting the committee's affairs. Later, the committee members decided to request the Board of Directors to increase the number of committee seats, and then form groups of four or five people each to investigate various aspects of the topic. Furthermore, regarding the housing problem in this port, the Municipal Council's various departments had previously conducted considerable investigations, especially the Public Works Department's investigation, which was the most detailed. Each department has now prepared a memorandum for the Housing Problem Investigation Committee to review. In addition, the Public Works Director also has suggestions for adding, deleting, and modifying the Municipal Council's building regulations. These were all discussed in detail at the recent meeting of the Investigation Committee, and were agreed to in principle.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Unable to Bear the Pain, He Cried Out - Ye Haisheng Described as Increasingly Weak - He Miserably Confessed to Being Framed <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Ye Swallowed Keys and Copper Buttons in Prison to Commit Suicide, But Both Times He Did Not Die - He Admitted to the Murder of Japanese Soldiers Because He Could Not Bear the Torture - The Judge Ordered Ye to Be Sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>The gun assassination of Japanese naval fleet soldier Nakayama Hideo stationed in Shanghai, for which the city authorities offered a reward for the arrest of the murderer, has been ongoing for half a year. Recently, the Public Concession Police successively arrested Cantonese Ye Haisheng (nickname Xiao Guangdong), Yang Wendao, and Zhou Sherong, and filed a public prosecution against them for murder. After repeated trials by the First Special District Court's collegial panel, Ye Haisheng repeatedly confessed that he shot the sailor, except that Yang and Zhou have not confessed. However, his confession was bizarre. For the sake of prudence, the presiding judge, Mr. Xiao Xiefei, ordered the police to escort Ye Haisheng and invited the Municipal Council's lawyer and the defendant's defense lawyer last Friday to personally go to the</p>
<p>Scene of the Incident</p>
<p>Area of Hongkou Binle'an Road to investigate and order Ye to demonstrate the situation of the shooting that day, in order to find the truth. Yesterday at 2 p.m., Presiding Judge Qian Hongye, together with Judges Xiao and Feng, held a continued trial. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru also attended the court to perform his duties. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Japanese military headquarters sent secretaries, section chiefs, armed military officers and soldiers to the court to observe. In addition, because the court's restrictions were very strict and arbitrary entry and exit were not allowed, there were only a few dozen people in the audience, so the courtroom did not feel crowded. However, the defendant Ye Haisheng's appearance was</p>
<p>Increasingly Weak</p>
<p>The detectives escorted Ye, along with Yang Wendao and Zhou Sherong, to the court and stood behind the defendant's dock, looking very listless. The lawyer Zhang Zhirang, who was appointed by the court to defend Ye, requested permission to present the results of the previous inspection with the judge before the start of the interrogation, regarding the two questions of the bullet and pistol found by the police at the scene. The court nodded in agreement. Lawyer Zhang then said that the police believed that the particle was the one that killed the Japanese sailor, but Ye Haisheng demonstrated the shooting situation that day, the deceased was facing north from the south, and Ye followed him. The bullet came from the</p>
<p>Back of the Japanese Soldier's Head</p>
<p>Shot in, piercing the forehead, and the Japanese soldier fell down, the bullet should have landed in front of the person who fell, but this bullet was actually found behind, and was found by Japanese detective No. 61. If the location where the bullet was found and the place where the Japanese soldier fell were not mistaken, then this bullet seemed to have nothing to do with the Japanese soldier's murder, because no bullet could have pierced the skull and then flown back from the front before landing. The Western detective also testified that the Japanese soldier fell slightly south of Fengle Lane, which is even more inconsistent with the direction where the bullet and shell were found. This is about the</p>
<p>Bullet Doubts</p>
<p>As for the pistol, according to the police investigation, it was found under the Fengle Lane police kiosk. Ye Haisheng also demonstrated the situation of abandoning the gun and escaping that day. If the situation he demonstrated was wrong with the facts at that time, then his words would not be credible. If the gun was indeed found under the kiosk, it would not have been possible to abandon it like that in a panic escape. The gun was found under the kiosk, and it had to be moved out with a wooden stick, which was quite similar to a deliberate hiding. If it was abandoned at will, how could it be so properly placed? However, when he abandoned it, he had no time to escape, so it was difficult to calmly place it. From this, it can be inferred that the gun is also</p>
<p>Unrelated to This Case</p>
<p>Other items, such as the books found in Yang Wendao's home, are even more inferior and have nothing to do with the case. After the defense lawyer was appointed to defend the defendant, he met with the defendant in the police station according to law and asked about everything. At that time, the Japanese detectives brought Ye from the prison to a small room and told Ye that they had come to visit him and questioned him about the facts of the crime. Ye initially said that he did not know anything about it and asked for an investigation. I then asked him since he did not know anything, why did he confess? Ye said sadly that he wanted to die quickly and hoped that after death he would become a vengeful ghost to avenge those who framed him. I explained to him that</p>
<p>Ghosts are Illusory</p>
<p>Do not have this idea, and comforted him again and again. Ye then said sadly that since being detained, he had swallowed the copper buttons attached to his clothes twice, but both times he did not die. He has diarrhea, or the copper objects he swallowed have been excreted, etc. Now his body is extremely weak and his nerves have obviously become abnormal. The most obvious manifestation is that the words he confessed in repeated court hearings are inconsistent, although he admits it every time, they are all words that cater to the facts. He admits everything that is unfavorable to him, but denies everything that is favorable to him. If he finds that what he said is inconsistent with the facts, he will try to justify himself in every possible way, guessing that he</p>
<p>Is Seeking a Quick Death</p>
<p>Is his confession still credible? When Judge Xiao was inspecting the scene, he suddenly shouted for help. The court should have seen this situation early on. However, he confessed on the one hand and complained of injustice on the other, which showed that his nerves were failing and that he really needed medical treatment. Therefore, he requested to be transferred to the hospital for treatment, and presented a map of the place where the incident occurred, pointing out how Ye performed at a certain place, where the Japanese soldier fell, and where the pistol and bullet were found, and the way Ye escaped. It was very detailed, while Ye frowned and sighed from time to time, and</p>
<p>Sobbed and Cried</p>
<p>After Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station spoke, he stood up and stated that the place where the bullet landed was indeed in front of the person who fell, and the police have never claimed that the bullet entered from the back of the head and pierced the forehead. It actually came out from the side, and this bullet has been confirmed by experts. If it really has nothing to do with this case, why would it be used as the basis for the prosecution? Lawyer Zhang then stated that, according to the Japanese doctor's testimony in court on May 6, the deceased was shot in the back of the head and came out from the front. The court then summoned the Western staff member of the Municipal Council who inspected firearms to the court to ask about the process of inspecting the bullet. According to the testimony, he had</p>
<p>Fired Ten Times</p>
<p>Among them, one time the bullet was fired, it flew backwards to a distance of eighteen feet before landing. As for the bullet that was found, because it had gone through many procedures, even if there were bloodstains left at the time, they would have been eliminated and it would be difficult to determine. In addition, the Western Deputy Detective of Diswei Road Police Station reported that, in addition to the witnesses who had been summoned, Pu Chaoying was also found, who had also witnessed it. Pu's previous testimony in the police station was consistent with the Japanese doctor's testimony and the report on the inspection of the bullet, etc. The court then ordered the clerk Ding Zhongnan to</p>
<p>Read the Transcript Aloud</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang immediately wrote "Generally Consistent" at the end of it. Then, a waiter from the Yuegong Hotel, surnamed Ren, was summoned to the court and asked if he knew Ye, Yang, and Zhou. Ren testified that Room No. 9 was opened by Xia Chunji, and many people came in and out. He had never seen Ye and the other three, and did not know them. Presiding Judge Qian then questioned Ye Haisheng, first asking why he had confessed to the crime and then cried and complained of injustice every time he was interrogated. Ye then cried and said, "I am only twenty-eight years old now and still a promising youth, but because of this case, I have swallowed two keys, a copper plate on the back of the suit, and a copper button on the pants in the police station in an attempt to commit suicide. It is really because</p>
<p>The Pain is Unbearable</p>
<p>That's why I did this, and confession is also for this, so that this case can be quickly settled. In fact, the Japanese soldier was not killed by me, and at that time, I was preparing to celebrate my mother's birthday on November 12th. On November 7th, 8th, and 9th, etc., I was busy sending out invitations, and Zhang Caiyuan was helping me book a banquet at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant. If I had killed the Japanese soldier, why didn't I escape afterwards, and why would I be in the mood to celebrate my mother's birthday? In short, there is a clear sky above and a presiding judge below. I definitely did not do this case. I returned to Shanghai from Qingdao in September last year, and went to Room No. 9 of the Yuegong Hotel every day. The invitations were also</p>
<p>Issued in That Room</p>
<p>You can investigate it. However, I have never seen the waiter who came to court today." The court said that because it had been a long time, most of the people who gathered that day, such as Xia Chunji, had dispersed. Only Zhang Caiyuan knew about it. The court immediately noted why he had confessed to the crime before. Ye burst into tears and uttered a miserable cry of "Alas," and then said that he had been framed and could not bear the torture after being detained, so he had to confess to seek death. Now, please give the judge a sentence as soon as possible. After saying this, he</p>
<p>Cried Out Loud</p>
<p>The court then turned to interrogate Yang Wendao, who testified that he went to Guangdong in November or December of the 22nd year and returned to Shanghai on November 13th of the following year. He did not serve as the director of the Public Security Bureau in Guangdong, and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau did not have any arrest warrants. He only met Ye in the Hongshun Society. The book with the hidden pistol found in my home was actually planted by Yang Jianzhong, because I had a pistol in the past and was afraid that the child would take it and cause trouble, so Jianzhong taught me to dig a hole in the book and hide it. This February, he came to my house. At that time, the book was in the child's hand, and I went upstairs to get cigarettes. When I came downstairs, the child had already</p>
<p>Went Out to Play</p>
<p>It must have been Jianzhong who took advantage of my going upstairs to replace my book with his book. When I was arrested and this book was found in my house, I still thought it was the original book, so I admitted it in court for the first time. After a detailed investigation, I realized that it was not the original book, Yun. At the end, Zhang Caiyuan climbed up and clarified that Ye did hold a banquet for his mother at the Da Zhonghua Restaurant on November 10th, and said that on the night the Japanese sailor was killed, he did see Ye escape after shooting. Presiding Judge Qian interrogated until here and instructed Ye to be sent to the Municipal Council Hospital and to send a forensic doctor to cooperate with the treatment. Yang and Zhou were taken back to the police station to wait for the continued hearing next Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Fish Vendors' Dispute Fully Resolved - Full Resumption of Business This Morning <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Vendor Representatives from Various Districts Dispatched to the Market to Assist</p>
<p>All Directors and Supervisors Personally Presided Over Affairs at the Market Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently experienced a market strike by vendors from various districts due to a small number of individuals obstructing business over transportation issues. Following earnest persuasion from the market, a partial resumption of business was achieved yesterday morning. However, a small number of people continued to obstruct operations. Yesterday, all directors and supervisors of the market personally went to the market to oversee the situation and mediate the dispute. A complete resolution was reached last night, and all fish vendors resumed business this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the occurrence of the fish vendors' dispute, and the market's explanations, the Tanhuhu Lianyi Association notified all fish vendors to resume business as usual yesterday morning. However, some individuals continued to cause trouble, resulting in obstruction. Incidents of vendors being stopped and beaten occurred, but were suppressed by the police. The Fish Market Board of Directors held an emergency joint meeting of all directors and supervisors at the Board of Directors' office in the Zhonghui Building yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to discuss solutions. Attendees included Chairman Du Yuesheng, Standing Directors Tang Chengzong, Gui Yanfang, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shenzhi, Yu Zuoting, as well as Market Manager Wang Xiaolai, and Deputy Managers Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Guchen. After the meeting concluded at 10:00 AM, all attending directors, supervisors, the manager and deputy managers went to the fish market at 11:00 AM to personally oversee the situation and prevent further disruptions. They remained until 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Business by Fish Vendors Citywide This Morning</p>
<p>Following the unfortunate events after business yesterday morning, the dispute has been completely resolved after repeated persuasion by the market. It is now understood that all fish vendors in the city will resume business as usual this morning. Market officials contacted many vendors regarding all issues as of last night, and all have come to an understanding, so there should be no further problems. Fish caught by fishermen during the market strike, which could not be sold, can also be completely sold off starting today.</p>
<p>Vendor Representatives from Various Districts Petitioned Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Vendors from various districts of the city have been cooperating and trading smoothly since the opening of the fish market. The unfortunate incident that occurred recently is deeply regrettable.

<h3 id="e122">Public Works Department Fire Brigade Implements Staff Reduction <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Senior Staff Given Retirement Pensions</p>
<p>Remaining Staff Dismissed Based on Seniority</p>
<p>Regarding the Public Works Department Fire Brigade's budget reduction, the Public Works Department directors Carnay, Qielili, and Zhuo Jiang formed a subcommittee to investigate improvements to the Fire Brigade's organization and finances. It is now heard that the subcommittee has recently reported to the directors, indicating that the Fire Brigade's development has indeed exceeded what is necessary for public safety. Therefore, staff reductions of both Chinese and foreign personnel are unavoidable. The subcommittee's recommendation regarding personnel reductions has also been carefully considered by the Public Works Department's Personnel Committee, which has established a plan. It has been found that three long-serving staff members in the Fire Brigade's headquarters are being dismissed. It is proposed that they be given retirement pensions based on their respective ages and years of service. Junior staff may be transferred to other Public Works Department offices or given severance pay based on their years of service. All dismissed staff will receive their full retirement savings. Furthermore, according to the subcommittee's recommendation, the three Fire Brigade lookout towers that were previously decided to be retained will now be staffed entirely by Chinese personnel. All foreign lookout tower staff will be dismissed. In addition to receiving their full retirement savings, these dismissed staff will also be entitled to severance pay and government-funded repatriation. Chinese junior staff without employment contracts will be given their full retirement savings, severance pay, and one month's salary, and may also be repatriated. The subcommittee believes that the aforementioned staff reduction plan will not affect the Fire Brigade's operational efficiency. Therefore, the directors have resolved to adopt the subcommittee's recommendations and plan to implement them in the near future.</p>

<p>Zhu the Dwarf Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Zhu the Dwarf, a local resident aged 61, works as a boatman ferrying goods between Pudong and Puxi. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he transported nine steel bars from Pudong and was preparing to unload them near the Zhapu Road Bridge when he suddenly spotted an iron ball at the bottom of the boat. Not knowing what it was, he hammered it with an iron mallet. Unexpectedly, the ball was a bomb, and it exploded upon impact with a loud bang. Iron fragments flew in all directions, and Zhu the Dwarf was hit head-on, causing severe head injuries with exposed flesh and blood. Nearby police officers were notified and immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched a vehicle to take him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Abnormal Temperature in May This Year <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Due to Excessively High Atmospheric Pressure</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the temperature in the city has dropped sharply in the past two or three days. Last Friday, the 5th, it was 79.7 degrees, while this Tuesday, the highest was only 66 degrees. According to the Zikawei Observatory, such cool weather in Shanghai in May is unprecedented in recent years. The reason is due to unusually high atmospheric pressure in the area, causing air to rise, while Siberian winds take the opportunity to invade from the northwest. In previous years at this time, Siberian air would have advanced eastward, but this year, due to the high pressure in China, it has turned southeast. As for why the atmospheric pressure is unusually high, the reason cannot be stated, and the observatory does not want to attribute it to sunspots or other similar phenomena. The observatory compared the temperature from May 1st to 26th this year with the same period last year. The average maximum temperature for the 26 days this year was slightly less than 70 degrees, while it was 85 degrees last year, a difference of more than 15 degrees, which is enough to indicate the abnormal temperature in Shanghai in May this year. The observatory also expects the temperature to increase gradually in the future, rather than changing suddenly.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Uninvited Guests Impersonate Public Servants - Search for Opium and Extort Money <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>First Extorted Thirty Dollars</p>
<p>Continued Attempt to Get the Remainder Led to Arrest</p>
<p>Guo Shangqi, a local resident over 50 years of age, lives at No. 633, Lane 623, Qipu Road, and owns some property. He lives off the rent he collects, but Guo has a weak body and is addicted to opium. He spends his days lying in bed, smoking opium to pass the time. At 1:45 PM the day before yesterday, three uninvited guests suddenly barged in. One of them took out a letter, claiming to be sent by the police station because the Huishi Police Station had recently received an anonymous letter alleging that Guo was not only consuming opium but also hiding firearms. Therefore, they had come to investigate. However, if he could pay 500 yuan in cash, the matter could be settled privately. Guo replied that he did not have such a large sum of money and asked for a reduction. After considerable discussion, they agreed on 100 yuan. Guo's accountant, Zou Yaosheng, first paid 30 yuan, and the remaining 70 yuan was agreed to be paid at 7:00 PM that evening. The three men then took the money and left. Shortly thereafter, Guo suspected that this situation was a fraud and an extortion attempt. He reported the matter to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Wang Youshan to Guo's house and waited nearby. At 7:15 PM the night before last, Ni Shunfu, Yang Shunbao, Gu Chunlin (from Hangzhou), and three other men arrived at Guo's house to demand the money. The detectives arrested them and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tiansa, stated the previous circumstances, saying that the police station had not yet completed the investigation of the case and requested permission to detain the suspects for further interrogation at a later date. Ni Shunfu and Yang Shunbao confessed to the accusations, while Gu Chunlin claimed to be a shop assistant at the Wanshun Sauce Garden on Xiaomalu in Zhabei. He said that he was passing Guo's door the night before last when his friend Yang Shunbao greeted him, and he was arrested while talking. Judge Tan Xinzhen verified the confession and ordered Ni and others to be detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Gu Zhuxuan Sentenced for Opium Use <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Eight Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for homicide and detained in the sick ward of the Guangci Hospital. He was reported for opium use by prisoners Li Heshang, Guo Shanyu, and Wang Er'er. Evidence such as opium residue and white powder was confiscated, and the supervisors Jia Furong and Wu Lu were accused of dereliction of duty and shielding the crime. The prosecutor investigated and filed a public lawsuit against Jia and Wu, and each was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Regarding Gu Zhuxuan, the Court Police Department filed a public lawsuit with the Second Special Court in accordance with the law. Judge Sun Peng conducted two court sessions and examined the accusers, concluding the proceedings and scheduling a date for sentencing. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At 2:30 PM, Judge Sun arrived at the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered Gu Zhuxuan to be brought to the stand. After briefly questioning his age and origin, he announced the main points of the verdict: Gu Zhuxuan is sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for opium use. Gu protested that there was no evidence and that he was sentenced based solely on empty words. The court summarized the reasons for the verdict, saying: This court has examined and determined that you engaged in opium use on December 24th of last year and on January 27th and 29th of this year. After Wang Er'er reported you, Chief Ouyang Sen confiscated evidence such as opium residue. Finally, the prosecutor also found a copper spoon with fresh opium traces, clearly showing that you used opium. Furthermore, prisoners Li Heshang, Guo Shanyu, and others repeatedly reported you. Although the forensic doctor determined that you had recently quit and could not find any evidence, your claim that Li and Guo extorted money from you is not credible, as their accusations are not fabricated. Now, in accordance with the Regulations on Prohibition of Opium and Drugs, you are sentenced. If you are not satisfied, you may file an appeal within ten days of receiving the judgment. After the verdict, he ordered the police to take Gu away and return him to custody.</p>

<p>Secret Revealed After Sending Servant to Retrieve Camera - Dancer Smiles and Acts Flippant in Court - Judge Urges Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>Cen Chunxuan (courtesy name Yunjie), a native of Xilin, Guangxi Province, who served as the Governor-General of Liangguang and the Chief Executive of the Southwest Military Government during the late Qing Dynasty, is now deceased. His fourth son, Cen Delin (also known as Shenxian), is now 26 years old. He studied in Germany and married Ding Naixian (now 24 years old), the younger sister of Ding Naiyang, former Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai, on March 11, 1931, at the Yipinxiang Hotel on Xizang Road, with Xu Yuanying and Tan Qizong as matchmakers. The wedding was presided over by Ding Naiyang and Cen Chunxuan, and the wedding officiant was Wen Zongyao, one of the seven executives of the Southwest Military Government. After the marriage, they lived together at No. 13 Gulou Street, Suzhou, and now have a daughter named Lizhen. Prior to Cen Delin's marriage to Ding, he already had a cohabiting relationship with a former</p>
<p>Shanghai Dancer</p>
<p>Zhang Ying (also known as Zhang Kun, now 26 years old), a local, with whom he had two daughters named Quanbao and Huibao. In July 1934, Cen Chunxuan and his wife found out about this affair and ordered Cen Delin to break off the relationship with Zhang Ying. Cen gave Zhang 3,000 yuan as a condition of their separation. The two daughters were taken back to the Cen family to be raised. From then on, they parted ways. Of the 3,000 yuan paid at the time, Cen Chunxuan's wife paid 2,000 yuan, and Ding paid the remaining 1,000 yuan. However, recently Ding suspected that Cen's actions were suspicious and that he was not returning to Suzhou to live with her. Therefore, she came to Shanghai to investigate and stayed at the home of her brother, Ding Shaosun, at No. 1 Mingdeli, Fuxu Road, but was ultimately unable to uncover</p>
<p>Delin's Secret</p>
<p>Until the eighth of last month, Cen Delin suddenly sent someone resembling a hotel waiter with a note to Ding Shaosun's residence to retrieve a camera. Ding Naixian questioned him and learned that the man was named Zhang Min, a waiter at the Seymour Apartments at No. 446 Seymour Road. She also learned that Cen Delin was cohabitating with another woman in Room 10 of the apartments. Ding then hired lawyer Tang Shenpei and reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police were ordered to investigate and found that the room was registered under the English name T.L. Tseng, which was indeed Cen Delin's name. So, at 3:20 AM on the 17th of this month, Detective Ma Ya and Chinese Detective Kaiyuan went to the apartment and found Cen Delin and a woman</p>
<p>Sleeping in the Same Bed</p>
<p>When asked the woman's name, she said that it was Zhang Ying. The police officers did not detain them because they were both people of status. They reported to the First Special District Court and issued a summons, summoning Cen Delin and Zhang Ying to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Ding Naixian also filed a civil suit through lawyer Tang, demanding that Cen pay 10,000 yuan in damages and 275.6 yuan in expenses incurred in investigating the case. First, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous circumstances, requesting that they be punished in accordance with Article 239 of the Criminal Law for adultery. Judge Chuan Lin questioned Cen Delin, who confessed that he and Ding Naixian were indeed</p>
<p>Legally Married</p>
<p>Zhang Ying is my concubine. I was introduced to her and began living with her when I was 19 years old. Because I went to Germany to study, my parents took the two daughters born to Zhang. However, we have never broken off our relationship. Furthermore, the plaintiff knew about our relationship, so the plaintiff is not allowed to sue according to Article 9 of the Implementation Law of the Criminal Law, etc. Zhang Ying confessed to cohabitating with Cen, saying that the plaintiff had repeatedly gone with them to dance halls, etc. She smiled and acted flippant during the confession. Lawyer Tang then said that there was a written agreement of separation between the two defendants, and Cen wrote a letter of repentance to his mother, but</p>
<p>This Evidence</p>
<p>Is all with the plaintiff, who is not turning it over now. However, a letter from the aunt to Cen on September 23, 1934, stating, "Is Zhang Ying still around? Then I will no longer consider you my son," also proves this point. The letter was written on behalf of Cen's sister, Demei. Furthermore, Cen repeatedly defrauded the plaintiff of several thousand yuan and jewelry under the pretext of using it to secure official positions. There is still a pawn ticket for a diamond ring and a telegram from the plaintiff's aunt instructing to extend the pawn ticket, all of which can be proven, etc. Judge Chuan, believing that the parents of both parties were prominent officials and that they were husband and wife, said that if the case went to trial, the results would not be good. Therefore, he advised both parties to reconcile and postponed the hearing for a week. Police lawyer Qian requested that the defendants be required to post bail because they had no occupation and were living in apartments. Judge Chuan then ordered Cen and Zhang to each post bail for whenever called. If they fail to appear, they will be liable for a bond of up to 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Fu Quanfu's Sinister Intentions</p>
<p>Hu Shouquan Suffers Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Hu Shouquan (21 years old) and Fu Quanfu (26 years old), both from Ningbo, work as boatmen on Chen Jinyong's barge. On the 24th of this month, the two got into an argument while chopping firewood in Songjiang. On the 25th, they set sail for Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 26th, Hu and Fu, along with a fellow crew member Fang Qingbao, planned to go to the Changle Teahouse on Simalu to seek Chen Jinyong's judgment. At 4:00 PM, while walking in front of No. 9, Edward Road at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, Fu suddenly produced a firewood axe hidden on his person and struck Hu in the back of the head on the left side. Hu's skull was split open and blood flowed profusely. Hu fell to the ground unconscious. Fu immediately threw away the axe and fled. Fang Qingbao chased after him and captured Fu. The police were notified, and they, along with the murder weapon, were taken to the police station. Hu was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After an investigation by Detective Tao Rongxian, Fu was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the defendant was arrested for attempted murder and that the victim was in serious condition at the hospital and could not appear in court. He requested that the hearing be postponed. Fu Quanfu confessed to the assault, saying that Hu had injured his left ankle in Songting, and he was seeking revenge. Judge Zhang Chaozuo verified the confession and ordered the hearing to be postponed to June. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Poor Ji Landi</p>
<p>Hateful Chen Wanjin</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the China Relief Association for Women and Children, together with customs patrol officers Huang Songsheng and Zhai Hekui, inspected the Beiyang Bandingsen liner of the Yihua Company at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. In the lower steerage, they found a lonely young girl whose condition was extremely suspicious. They questioned her, and she said that her aunt ran an antique shop in Tianjin and that she was taking the ship to Tianjin to find her. The officers pretended to say that she was not allowed to travel alone, and the girl pointed to another man on the top of the ship. The officers went to the top of the ship and saw a young man trying to escape. He was obviously guilty, so he was arrested and taken to the police station with the girl. After a separate and detailed interrogation, the girl said that her name was Ji Landi, also known as Miaogen, and that she was 15 years old and from Wuxi. When she was eight years old, her parents sold her to a Qian woman to be raised as an adopted daughter. She now lives at No. 29, Tiandeli, Xiangyanqiao, Wuhua Road. Because her adoptive parents were working outside during the day, leaving her alone at home, she was lured by the defendant Chen Wanjin on the 25th of this month, who said that he would take her to Tianjin for fun. Unexpectedly, she was</p>

<p>Opinions of Some Fish Merchants Expected to Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry, some fish merchants have disagreed and are still operating in the 16th Pier, which has prevented the fisheries from being concentrated in the new market. In order to promote the organization and development of fisheries, the Ministry of Industry has sent a letter to the Fish Market Council, sincerely persuading the fish merchants who have not joined to eliminate mutual prejudices. It is heard that there is now hope for a compromise. As for Xu Yangshan, Zhang Yinsheng, and other representatives sent by the fisheries to Beijing again to petition the Ministry of Industry, they have received a satisfactory reply and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The requested improvements to the market and wharf facilities have been notified by the Ministry to the Fish Market Council in a letter. Yesterday afternoon, the standing directors Gui Yanfang and others personally went to the market to survey the situation. Regarding the widening of the gangways, the installation of wire mesh at the wharf, and the regulation of traffic routes in the market, all have been implemented. As for the establishment of a fisheries banking syndicate, Gui Yanfang is currently in contact with Qian Xinzhijian. After a detailed plan is drafted, a meeting will be convened with the twelve banks that are investing, with the establishment expected in early July.</p>

<p>More than one hundred trade associations in this city, including the machine dyeing and weaving industry, sugar industry, tea industry, domestic rubber products industry, north-south goods brokerage industry, medicinal materials industry, fruit and local goods industry, new medicine industry, pharmaceutical factory industry, travel industry, local goods industry, biscuit, candy, canned food and bread industry, silk and satin printing industry, iron printing and can industry, thermos bottle manufacturing industry, cattle and sheep raw leather industry, fur, oil and bone industry, electrical appliance industry, freight car industry, simple book industry, pawnshop industry, shoe leather nail last industry, tree firewood industry, fresh pork slaughtering industry, fresh pork selling industry, duck slaughtering industry, wood industry, flower industry, Lu Sun industry, woolen factory industry, redwood dismantling industry, seafood grocery industry, lumber industry, western paint industry, silk dyeing workshop industry, glass industry, knitting industry, napping industry, refining industry, etc., issued a joint statement yesterday regarding the attacks against Wang Xiaolai: Recently, a so-called Federation of Industry and Commerce has printed and distributed leaflets slandering Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the current consultant to the Chamber of Commerce. According to the Yongli Factory listed on the leaflet, it is a member of the Rubber Industry Association, the Samsung Factory and Shunfeng Factory are members of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Xiefengsheng Pharmacy is a member of the Medicinal Materials Industry Association, Gong Fanglai is a member of the North-South Goods Brokerage Industry Association, and Guangyuan Sugar Firm is a member of the Sugar Industry Association. All of these are completely untrue. The false accusations are often made by unscrupulous people who forge names, engrave needles privately, and have ulterior motives. Mr. Wang Xiaolai has led the Chamber of Commerce for many years with fairness and integrity. Chinese and foreign merchants and public opinion are united. The rumors do not harm him in the slightest. However, the associations are all legitimate merchant organizations in this city, and it is difficult for us to remain silent in the face of this malicious attack. Therefore, we issue this joint statement, hoping that it will be noted.</p>
<h3 id="e137">New Invention: Free Light Bulb Factory Established <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>One Bulb Can Be Used for Five Purposes</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Approves Patent</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese people have been making new and wonderful inventions in industry. Recently, Mr. Bao has invented a free light bulb whose light can be changed at will, and Mr. Yu Weiqing has independently established a Qite Light Bulb Factory to manufacture it. Yesterday, the factory officially opened and invited reporters to visit in the morning. The factory is located at No. 457, North Henan Road. According to the inventor Mr. Bao, he was originally a worker at the power company, but in his spare time, he was able to study the electrical business carefully. Because he felt that the brightness of the light bulb could not be freely adjusted, he started the motivation for research and improvement. After about two years of trial and error, he succeeded and created two sample bulbs, which were submitted to the Ministry of Industry and approved for a five-year patent under the Ministry of Industry's No. 1324. Now, Mr. Su Yu Weiqing has invested in setting up a factory to manufacture it. From the beginning of preparation to the present, it has been more than half a year. After many researches and improvements, and months of field tests, it can be officially shipped. In addition to manufacturing patented light bulbs, it also manufactures ordinary single-use light bulbs to meet the needs of society, etc. This kind of light bulb has three kinds. One is called the Qi character bulb, which contains three light wires of different brightness. The first wire is 5 candlepower, the second wire is 25 candlepower, and the third wire is 15 candlepower. The change of brightness completely depends on the spring part inside the specially made copper head. From the surface, it is no different from the copper head of an ordinary light bulb. In fact, its structure is divided into two layers, inner and outer. The copper head is installed on the glass shell and tightly attached inside the outer copper head. The structure of the spring part is extremely complex. When using it, the user only needs to press the glass shell with one hand and rotate it slightly. The first wire of 5 candlepower will light up alone. Continue to rotate, the second wire and the first wire will light up at the same time, adding up to 20 candlepower. Then turn to the second wire to light up alone, which is 25 candlepower. Then the third wire and the second wire will light up at the same time, adding up to 40 candlepower. The third wire lights up alone, which is 15 candlepower. Another turn can automatically extinguish it without having to turn on or off the switch. And you can turn left or right as you like, without the risk of electric shock or explosion. So with only one bulb, you can use it as five. Ordinary families need it the most. There is also a special character bulb with three filaments inside, all of the same brightness. Adjacent filaments cannot light up at the same time. The structure of the copper head is the same as the Qi character bulb. When the first filament inside is damaged, you only need to press the glass shell with your hand and rotate it slightly. The first filament can still light up. After the first filament breaks, the third filament can still be used. Therefore, the use time of this light bulb is no different from that of three ordinary light bulbs. Factories, schools, stores and other institutions can save the trouble of replacing light bulbs when they use this kind of light bulb. It is the most economical and suitable. As for the style of the glass shell, in addition to the ordinary round bulb, there is also a new type of flat round bulb. This kind of light bulb emits light in all directions, and there is absolutely no drawback of consuming light. The style is beautiful and completely different from ordinary light bulbs. It is really an unprecedented creation in the light bulb industry.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Shanghai Telephone Company Issues Supplementary Remarks <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a statement on May 24th, the purpose of which was to make telephone users more aware of telephone services. However, a few points in it have caused misunderstandings, and it seems necessary to explain them. The Shanghai Telephone Company's work report for the previous year was sent to the工部局 (Gōngbù jú, an administrative organ during the concession era) and published. It mentioned that in 1935, it suffered losses due to the influence of the market. In January and February of this year, it still suffered losses. However, since March 1st, the number of users has increased by several thousands due to the implementation of the new price rate calculated by the number of calls. From April to now, the number of telephone users has continued to increase. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Company firmly believes that its users know that the new price rate is not a burden, but can obtain higher value. A little more explanation can also be given regarding the telephone book. All basic records are registered in the English telephone book. What is contained in the Chinese telephone book is only for the convenience of Chinese users for reference. Therefore, in the currently published Chinese telephone book, all unnecessary records and names have been deleted in order to make the cost more economical and not lose its original value, and to make it more convenient for those who use the Chinese telephone book. From this point of view, it is indeed wrong to determine the amount of business of the Shanghai Telephone Company based on the number of telephone books. In short, since March 1st of this year, people from all walks of life have become increasingly aware of telephone services, and therefore the number of people installing telephones has also increased day by day.</p>

The landscapes and figures she paints are lifelike. In the past, she hand-copied the portraits of emperors and empresses of past dynasties in the Qing Palace, and the models of the Summer Palace and Grand View Garden she made were exhibited at the Philadelphia World's Fair in the United States in 1926, and were highly praised by people in that country. Now she is exhibiting more than 200 of her carefully crafted works, as well as portraits of emperors and empresses of past dynasties and models of the Summer Palace and Grand View Garden, from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM on the 28th and 29th of this month, together with the works of Ms. Kang Tongbi, at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road.

She traveled alone to the Americas at a young age to find her relatives, and her beautiful words have been spread. She, Yang Lingfu and Lu Bicheng were praised as outstanding women in China. Now the two of them are exhibiting their works together, which is truly a perfect match.</p>

<p>The National Diocesan Representatives Conference of the Chinese Catholic Action Society held in Shanghai from September 8th to 15th last fall was an unprecedented event in the history of Chinese Catholicism. It brought together more than 200 representatives from various dioceses across the country and overseas Chinese, both male and female, to discuss religious affairs and work hard on moral construction. It was highly praised by the National Government and the Executive Yuan authorities. Now, the General Supervision Office of the Catholic Action Society at No. 6, Jia Alley, Neizifu, Beijing has compiled and printed the records of the conference, which are divided into five chapters: Conference Chronicles, Meeting Affairs Report, Speeches, Resolutions, and Proposal Compilation. The entire book is a large four-page volume with a total of more than 450 pages and more than 400,000 words. The beginning of the book is reprinted with important photos of the conference, as well as congratulatory messages written by Chairman Lin, President Wang, President Sun, Minister Kong, and President Ju, which are very precious. The book has now been published and sells for 1 yuan and 6 jiao in national currency per copy.

<h3 id="e141">Winners of the 22nd Aviation Lottery <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>23rd Issue, June 5th Prize</p>
<p>Lucky Ones Should Not Miss the Opportunity to Get Rich</p>
<p>The 22nd issue of the National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was drawn on May 8th at Yiyuan. The first prize, No. 101564, was sent by the Da Yun Company's Mail Order Department at No. 170, Fada Road, Shanghai, as a whole sheet to Francicco Gorcia, an employee of the Da Jia Shipping Company in Hong Kong, and his friend Eanrtanitno Rojar. His friend works for a life insurance company in Hong Kong. When the prize was drawn this time, his friend happened to be going to the Philippines. While reading the newspaper on the way, he learned that the ticket they had jointly purchased had won the first prize. At that time, he was still half-convinced, so he sent a telegram to the Da Yun Company to inquire and prepaid the return telegram fee. He received a reply confirming it and happily arrived in the Philippines. After finishing his business, he returned to Hong Kong. One of them had already gone to Shanghai to claim the prize a few days ago. The second prize, No. 249470, sold in strips by the Da Yun Company's retail department, was reportedly won by Mr. Zhang from a certain company on the Bund, Gongguan Road, two strips; Mr. So-and-So, an accountant at a certain shoe store on Fada Road, one strip; a certain Russian woman at No. 191, Lane, Yuhui Road, five strips; two trumpeters in Wangyun Road, Chengnai, jointly one strip; and vegetable vendor Shi Laoer in Longhua Road, one strip. In addition, Lin, a Sichuan traveler from Huadong Company, was sold four second prizes by the Huiliyuan in Daijiao. Three strips were won by workers at a certain yarn factory in Daijiao, and two strips were won by a driver at Zhang Gongguan in Hede Road. The above winners have all received their prize money from the three designated banks one after another. There are many other winners of the third prize in this and other ports, too many to list in detail. Among them, there are two trumpeters who won the prize. According to them, on April 25th, the band played music for a wedding for a certain family in Dadong Doujiu Restaurant. When they returned at 12:00 PM that night, they planned to jointly purchase a lottery ticket with a reward of 5 jiao. At that time, it was late at night, and all the ticket sales numbers were asleep. The next morning, they were hired to work at a big discount at a certain foreign goods store on Fada Road. Passing by the Da Yun Company, they bought a ticket and won the second prize. It was also a coincidence. The 23rd issue lottery will be drawn on June 5th, which is another opportunity for the lucky ones to get rich, so don't miss it.</p>

<p>— Chief Editor, China Credit</p>
<p>(An Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 26)</p>
<p>(4) Types of Paint: Paint types vary depending on their purpose, with distinctions for protecting gold, wood, and earth. Due to the numerous names and differences in volume and color, it is difficult for those unfamiliar with the industry to understand them. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Paint: Divided into white and colored varieties. White paint is graded into six levels: 4A, 3A (or Super Superior), Double A, A, B, and C. Colored paint is graded into three levels: 3A, Double A, and A. 4A is the highest quality, descending in order. Housing, ships, and railways use a considerable amount, with gray paint being particularly popular. B and C grade paints are of lower quality and are only used as a primer (base coat). Sold by the "can" (喊), with each can divided into four small iron boxes, each box containing 28 pounds.</p>
<p>Ready-Mixed Paint: Divided into glossy and matte varieties, with grades of 3A and Double A. Used for high-end products and advertising signs. Measured in gallons. Apart from the five-gallon iron containers, one-gallon, half-gallon, and 2.5-gallon sizes are packaged in printed tin cans.</p>
<p>Enamel Paint: Similar in effect to varnish, suitable for coating both wood and iron items. Packaged in small, printed round cans, available in one-pound and half-pound sizes.</p>
<p>Red Lead Anti-Rust Paint: Specifically for use on roofs, bridges, ships, and ironware, with a rust-preventative effect, hence the name. Measured by the barrel, each barrel containing 56 pounds.</p>
<p>Varnish: Made by dissolving resins into a liquid. When applied to the surface of an object, it produces a sheen when dry. Therefore, it is commonly used on chairs, tables, wood, tin cans, labels, etc. Due to the different raw materials used, it is classified into types such as Amber Varnish, Kauri Varnish, Dammar Varnish, Sandarac Varnish, and Mastic Varnish.</p>
<p>(5) Paint Business Operations: The peak months for the paint business are spring and autumn, while summer and winter are slow months. The progress or decline of the business is tied to the prosperity of industries. In recent years, the real estate market has declined, and construction has stagnated, making it difficult for the industry to develop. The annual turnover of each factory ranges from over 800,000 yuan to as little as just over 100,000 yuan. Sales are primarily conducted through agents, who are paid commissions. Agents are stationed in various ports, and when goods are needed, they can directly purchase from the factory, with payment made after the goods are shipped and packed. There are also agencies in the Nanyang Islands, such as Zhen He in Singapore, Ying Hua in Batavia, and Hua Feng Tai in San Bin, all of which are sales outlets for Shanghai paints. The largest consumers of paint, such as shipyards and railways, use a bidding system, which creates competition among businesses. Construction companies mostly obtain their supplies through hardware stores, with few direct transactions. Foreign companies operating paint businesses in Shanghai include Jiu Ji, Xuan Qiao, Ji Xing, Hong Shou, Heng Da, Mei He, and Ruixiang Foreign Firm, among others, with Ji Xing having the largest scope, with annual sales reaching one million yuan. Local Anhui paint shops also act as sales agents. According to a survey from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), seven Chinese paint factories sold approximately 22,684,123 pounds of paint and approximately 301,641 gallons of varnish. The business index for recent years is as follows (using 1930 as the base year):</p>
<p>(6) Paint Sales and Imports: Paint sales are concentrated in urban areas, with very little use in remote rural areas. Shanghai, as a major commercial port with numerous tall buildings, has the highest demand and prefers high-quality products. However, due to various factors, the sales volume of domestic products is still lower than that of foreign products. However, in places such as Hankou, Sichuan, Qingdao, Fujian, and Guangdong, domestically produced paint can still occupy a considerable advantage. According to expert estimates, the ratio of domestic to foreign paint sales in Shanghai is 3:7, while in other domestic ports, it is the opposite. The three northeastern provinces were originally a region of high paint sales, but after the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), they have disappeared from the market. The Nanyang region is the only export destination for our country's paint, but it has recently been affected by the dumping of Japanese goods, leading to a significant decline.</p>
<p>The annual value of imported foreign paint is approximately one million Customs Gold Units. Imports from the United Kingdom are the most significant, followed by the United States, and then Japan. In terms of imported types, the United Kingdom mainly imports thick paint, the United States mainly imports varnish, and Japan mainly imports enamel paint. For the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the total import value was 817,777 Customs Gold Units, of which British goods accounted for 213,591, American goods accounted for 186,863, and Japanese goods accounted for 103,545. The ports of entry with the highest import volumes were Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. In the 24th year, 551,273 Customs Gold Units were imported into Shanghai, 71,493 Customs Gold Units were imported into Tianjin, and 40,907 Customs Gold Units were imported into Guangzhou. The import values for the past two years are listed below (in Customs Gold Units):</p>

<h3 id="e150">Detailed Record of the Competition Between the Training Class and Beijing City: Chen Baoqiu Breaks Another Far Eastern Record; Discus and 1500 Meters Also Set National Records <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The athletes from our country's World Games Track and Field Training Class and basketball team have gained a lot at Tsinghua University, and their results are outstanding. The Beiping City Spring Games were held for three days at the end of the training class. The results were also excellent among the provinces and cities in North China. Therefore, the top three in the Spring Games were selected as representatives of the Beiping team and agreed to compete against the World Games athletes at the Beiping Xian Nong Tan Public Stadium at 2 PM on the 25th. As a result, Chen Binqiu's shot put broke the Far Eastern record again. Guo Jie and Ma Wenbin's discus throws set new national records. Jia Lianren's 1500 meters also broke the national record. Peng Yongxin's javelin throw equaled the national record. The basketball performance was dispersed after only one game due to spectators rushing into the arena. A detailed record of the grand occasion and results is as follows:</p>

<p>Zhao Bingheng First in 100 Meters</p>
<p>The 100-meter race was held first. Liu Changchun was unable to compete due to a foot ailment that required rest. The participants from the World Games training class were Zhao Bingheng and Fu Baolu. The representatives from Beiping were Yan Zhaoshen, Yang Haipeng, and Wang Qiang, for a total of five people. At the start, Yan Zhaoshen took the lead. Zhao Bingheng was at the back for the first 20 meters. Zhao then charged forward at 30 meters, leading the way. He finished in one breath, about a meter ahead of Yan at the finish line. The time was 11.1 seconds. Zhao Bingheng's start was a bit slow, and his final sprint was also a bit weak. He needs to work on pushing his chest forward. However, his speed is indeed comparable to Liu Changchun. His running stride and swing are both excellent. If he can further study the start and finish, a time of 10.7 or 10.8 seconds is not difficult to achieve. Yan Zhaoshen's original name was Yan Chengtian. Although he is a newcomer in Tianjin with Han Jinglin and Yang Bozhong, he is also a promising talent.</p>
<p>200 Meters Dai Shu Guo Champion</p>
<p>The 200-meter race started at 4 PM. Three people participated. The course was a straight line. Zhao Bingheng did not participate because he felt a bit tired after the 100-meter race. Dai Shuguo made a guest appearance (Dai originally specialized in the 400 meters). Dai also fell behind at the start. After about 40 meters, Dai had already moved two steps ahead. The others could only see his dust and follow behind. He was about four feet away from the second place at the finish line. Xiao Dai's body is a bit thin, so it may not be suitable for him to train in the 400 meters. However, his upper body swing in the 200 meters is not quite right, so it slightly affected the result. However, his running the 200 meters was ultimately a guest appearance, so we should not be too demanding.</p>
<p>Two Competitors in the 400 Meters</p>
<p>There were only two participants in the 400 meters: Li Shiming from the World Games training class and Zhang Yinglong from the Beiping city team. It was a pity that Dai Shuguo could not compete at the same time. After 50 meters, Li was leading by about seven or eight meters. At the finish line, the time was 53.3 seconds. The second place, Zhang Yinglong, had a time of 57.6 seconds. Li's running style in the first stage was still good. His calf movements are not yet perfect, and his waist straightening needs to be trained.</p>
<p>1500 Meters Breaks National Record</p>
<p>The 1500-meter race started at 3 PM. Only Jia Lianren and Du Huaju participated. Du Huaju initially followed about two meters behind Jia. After 400 meters, Du gradually became exhausted and fell behind by about ten meters. Jia continued to work hard and ran freely. At the 1100-meter mark, Jia was about 100 meters ahead of Du, with a time of 3 minutes 7 seconds. Before long, the entire course was about to be completed. Jia further increased his speed in the last 100 meters, using his final sprint. His time was 4 minutes 20 seconds. Although it was slightly slower than the previous record of 4 minutes 13 seconds, it still broke the national record. The second place, Du Huaju's time, was 4 minutes 53 seconds. Jia's expression was normal after the race, without any sign of exhaustion, which was already commendable. His tall and solid physique did not seem like that of a middle-distance runner.</p>
<p>High Hurdles Shaozhou Wins Nationally</p>
<p>Three people participated in the 110-meter high hurdles: Lin Shaozhou, Huang Ying傺, and Yang Daochong. They competed at 2 PM, after the 100-meter race. Lin and Huang's results were similar, and the competition was fierce and very interesting. Initially, the three were parallel. By the third hurdle, Yang Daochong had fallen behind by about a meter. It was difficult to distinguish between Lin and Huang. They were almost the same. The entire course was completed, with Lin and Huang separated by only one shoulder. The time was 16 seconds. Lin Shaozhou's high hurdle posture is very good, but his waist is slightly bent when he lowers. Huang's hurdle crossing is worse, but his speed is still commendable.</p>
<p>1600 Meter Relay Beiping Falls Behind</p>
<p>The 1600-meter relay training class athletes were Jia Lianren, Dong Hanwen, Li Shiming, and Dai Shuguo. The Beiping representatives were Wu Bin, Zhang Jiming, Du Huaju, and Yan Zhaoshen. In the first leg, Jia Lianren ran ahead by more than 20 meters. There was little progress in the second leg. In the third leg, the Beiping representatives had fallen behind by more than 100 meters. Dai Shuguo held the baton and rushed forward in the fourth leg. When he reached the finish line, he was about 150 meters ahead of the Beiping representatives. The time was 5 minutes 1 second. The training class athletes' baton passing was still poor. If Liu Changchun could replace Dong Hanwen, the result would be even more impressive, because Dong has not been focusing on the 400 meters for a long time.</p>
<p>Track and Field Sketches</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Breaks the Far Eastern Record Twice</p>
<p>The participants in this event were Chen Baoqiu and Guo Jie from the training class, and Tian Jingyao and Cui Xiangkang from Beiping. Each person threw six times. Chen Baoqiu's initial throw was 12 meters. Guo Jie was only 10 meters. Tian Jingyao was 9 meters. Cui Xiangkang was behind them. In the second throw, Tian Jingyao defeated Guo Jie. Chen Baoqiu had reached 12.98 meters. Finally, the Iron Bull shouted and threw 13.26 meters, breaking the Far Eastern record. The previous Far Eastern record holder was the Japanese athlete Abe Isao, with a result of 12.905 meters. Tian Jingyao was 11.41 meters. Guo Jie was 11.3 meters. Cui Xiangkang was 10.64 meters. Chen's one time breaking the Far Eastern record was at the last test at Tsinghua.</p>
<p>Javelin Peng Yongxin Equals National Record</p>
<p>Da Peng worked hard because he failed the test in Tsinghua, and he also failed at the Spring Games a few days ago. He used an injection of stimulant. On the 25th, the weather was good, and there was no headwind, so he could perform at his best. Zhou Changxing also did not show weakness and closely followed him. Peng achieved a national record of 50.56 meters on the third throw. Changxing's result was 49.65 meters, in second place. Third and fourth were Li Shiming and Bi Huaxuan from Beiping.</p>
<p>Guo Jie Breaks National Discus Record Twice</p>
<p>The discus results were also a great achievement. Guo Jie set a new record of 39.62 meters at the fifth test a few days ago. Yesterday, his release was very stable and his posture was reasonable. He did not have the problem of focusing too much on one side. When he reached 41.13 meters, he not only broke the national record of 37.85 meters held by Leng Peigen, but also exceeded his result from the fifth test. Ma Wenbin's strength was weaker, but it was also amazing. He broke the national record with a result of 38.50 meters.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu's Pole Breaks Again</p>
<p>After the long-awaited pole vault appeared, the entire stadium cheered. The starting height was 2.90 meters. Fu jumped over it in one leap, and his posture was beautiful, exciting the audience. Zhan Yiyuan's first attempt was unsuccessful. Xu Shoupeng imitated him. Zhan and Xu barely crossed the bar on the second attempt and barely overcame the difficulty. They then raised it to 3.05 meters and then to 3.71 meters. Baolu jumped over them all. Zhan and Xu failed on three attempts. The pole broke when it was released because the distance between the pole and the pole rack was too close. At 3.73 inches, Fu jumped over again twice. Because only Fu was pole vaulting, and the pole he used was cracked due to the dry weather and could not be used, he could not show his skills. Head coach John Ma stopped him because he was afraid of being too tired. The item that everyone was watching came to an end.</p>
<p>Liu Mengjiu's High Jump Approaches National Record</p>
<p>Wu Bixian from the High Jump Competition Training Class did not appear in Tianjin. Liu Mengjiu attended. Liu overwhelmed the famous Beiping player Jin Yan at the 16th North China Games and became famous. Several years have passed, and the record is still there. Wang Shilin also did not participate. Zhou Changxing accompanied him to participate. Yang Xiangsun and Zhang Shutian from the Normal University of Beiping appeared. They started jumping from 1.60 meters. The bar gradually increased, and gradually eliminated. Later, because the sandpit was not loose enough, the venue was moved to a better location for another competition. Raised to 1.8 meters, which is close to Wu Bixian's national record (1.83 meters). Liu leaped over it three times and exhausted his strength. If the bar is raised again, he did not create a new record. Zhou Changxing used too much force in throwing the javelin and became crossbow arrows. He retreated to fourth place. Yang and Zhang were ranked second and third.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Talks</p>
<p>More than 20 people from our country's World Games Track and Field Training Class, including Jia Lianren, Huang Yingjie, Liu Changchun, Fu Baolu, Guo Jie, and Lin Shaozhou, were invited by Beiping Mayor Qin Dechun to a luncheon at the city government's assembly hall at 12 noon on the 26th. The athletes took two large cars from Tsinghua University to the city for the banquet. All the officials from the Spring Games accompanied them, and Li Zhou, the sports supervisor of the Social Bureau, Le Yongnian, the director of the middle school department, and Wang Lan, a veteran of the sports world, were responsible for the reception. Mayor Qin Dechun personally attended and gave a speech. The banquet was very lively. They all dispersed happily around 2 PM. After the banquet, all the athletes took cars to the East Station and took the train to Tianjin at 3:35 PM. They stayed at the Tianjin YMCA. They had a friendly match with British athletes in Tianjin on the 27th. After the game, they took the train south and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th. According to team leader Liu Changchun, the entire team plans to compete against Western foreigners in Shanghai and will sail overseas on June 26th. The team has been training in Ping for more than a month, and many national records have been broken. Fu Baolu's pole vault broke the Far Eastern record, with a result of 4.015 meters, breaking the 4-meter record held by Japanese athlete Nishi Yu at the Far Eastern Games. Chen Baoqiu's shot put broke the Far Eastern record twice. The first decision was at the final test of the training class, with a result of 12.975 meters, breaking the 12.905 record held by Akiyama Akira at the Far Eastern Games today. The second was on the 25th, that is, the training class athletes competed against the top three in the Beiping Spring Games. Chen broke Akiyama's highest record again with a result of 13.263, further achieving good results. Although Fu and Chen's results may not win the championship at the World Games, Fu's pole vault, if using a good pole and with further training, is not far from the world record, and may be able to show some talent in Berlin, to wash away the shame of our Chinese nation's sick man. As for the representatives to Germany, it has not yet been determined, and it will be determined after the preliminaries in Shanghai. For this preliminary election in Shanghai, attention must also be paid to the sportsmanship of the athletes, because international competitions are different from domestic competitions. A moment of carelessness is related to the national face, so it is not easy to talk about who in the training class can go abroad at this moment, but Fu and Chen are quite confident, and he himself is getting old and unable to do anything, and his leg disease has not healed, so he is afraid that he will not be selected.</p>

<p>The gold market was relatively stable yesterday due to the decline in the silver market and the rise in raw gold. However, as large dealers had high appetites, supply exceeded demand, and prices gradually fell back. However, the overall trend in the morning was very peaceful. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market reported that London was shrinking and the US was flat. It was said that after the close of trading, sellers were quoting 0.0625 lower than the posted price, but buyers were 0.125 lower, and no transactions were made.

Dada, Yong, and others bought in, while Qingfa, Yongchun, Yuanyong, and others came out to offer, and the market fluctuated. The morning opening was high, and it remained stable because large dealers were still buying. However, sellers took advantage of the high prices and actively sold, making it difficult to sustain. The HSBC posted exchange rate was flat for both British and American currencies, and prices fell back again. However, as there were many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, the situation was maintained. Although the silver equalization tax shrank by 0.25, it rose slightly afterwards. However, there were still many people wanting to sell, and buyers were watching, resulting in a downstream close at noon. The swap premium remained at 3.1 yuan. The morning market situation is recorded below:</p>

After fluctuating, the closing price at noon was 1137.1 yuan, and the market was flat after the close.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the central bank's standard premium price, was posted at 1135.7 yuan, about 1 yuan higher than the closing price, and 0.6 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for June was 1133 yuan, and for July, 1137 yuan. The morning replenishment water was 1133 yuan. The price of pure gold was 5 yuan higher, at 1142.7 yuan.

Early in the morning, the overseas silver market reported that London's near-term shrunk by 0.0625 and the long-term shrunk by 0.125.

British pound to US dollar rose by 0.125, US dollar to British pound rose by 0.03125, US dollar to French franc shrank by 0.0625, and British pound to French franc remained unchanged. The opening selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 2.375 pence for the British pound and 25.8125 yuan for the US dollar, which was flat for both British and American currencies compared to the previous close. Banks traded with each other. Although Japan was blocking the East Exchange, the HSBC posted exchange rate was flat for both British and American currencies, and the overall trend was stable. Later, the silver equalization tax shrank by 0.25. At this time, because banks were buying US dollars and blocking British pounds, exchange rates were falling, but the process was still flat. Finally, the banks' buying and blocking were uneven, and there were many trades. There were no special changes until noon. The recent selling prices were 1 shilling 2.375 pence for the British pound and 25.8125 yuan for the US dollar, which were flat for both British and American currencies compared to the previous close. Chinese traders lacked activity. Xinfeng Foreign Firm slightly bought US dollars.

<h3 id="e168">Securities, The Brewing Bond Market <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Although the July Term Has Been Launched... Transactions Still Show No Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, July futures began trading. Although they have been opened one after another, transactions still show no improvement. Sentiment among various groups remains sluggish. Both long and short positions seem to be held intentionally or unintentionally. In reality, because large dealers are not moving and the base is thin, it is not easy to stir up huge waves. Dealers with slightly more transactions are gradually shifting their attention, causing the securities market to become even more lonely and desolate. It can be compared to a wide river with shallow water and no waves. As for yesterday's experience, although rumors were spreading in North China, making the situation more worrying, the bond market on the surface still seemed unaffected. However, the foundation ultimately felt loose. Serial selling of the 37th issue was frequent. Although the quantity was large, retail investors made up for it, like stars surrounding the moon. Therefore, it was difficult for prices to fall rapidly after each recovery. At the opening in the morning, most people were watching, and the market situation was extremely stable. In the next round, because the selling pressure on the 37th issue was slightly strong, there was a slight weakening of 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, the 11th and 43rd issues, etc., were slightly in demand, and retail investors also made sporadic replenishments, leading to a recovery of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. As the closing transactions were cleared, the market situation was even more chaotic. Increases and decreases were mixed, and it ultimately did not escape the state of brewing and fluctuation. The market price results, excluding the new July issue, were slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was 2.14 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e169">Yarn and Cotton, The Bulls Still Maintain, The Yarn Market Advances Slowly <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be strong. Because the number of chips in the market was dry and the market situation was tight, the sales of spot yarn by customers still did not have a large number of development news, so the market atmosphere was still quiet. However, the inventory of yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse has accumulated to a huge 32,000 bales, and it is said that a certain party has successively received 20,000 bales.</p>
<p>The price of standard yarn continued to rise by about one yuan</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard yarn market, each month continued to show an upward trend. Because the long side's attitude was stable after the settlement, and a portion of the long gold industry group came to buy, the market atmosphere became tighter, and the market price slowly advanced. By the close, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were not smooth, and the long-term price fell back. As a result, each month rose by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.6 yuan compared with the previous day's closing price. After the opening in the afternoon, Fengtaihao was newly listed and purchased according to the market, and the surface turned tight and firm. As a result, each month rose by 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 yuan compared with the morning closing price. The price of the 8th, 9th, and 13th months also rose above the 200 yuan mark outside the customs. It was found that 1,000 bales of Dafu were sold, 750 bales of Changyu, 500 bales of Yichang, 2,500 bales of Changfeng, 2,900 bales of Shengyuan, 600 bales of Runkang, 950 bales of Yongchang, 2,900 bales of Shengyuan, 600 bales of Runkang, 950 bales of Yongchang, 700 bales of Shenji, and 750 bales of Xiecheng. 1,250 bales of Hengyi were bought, 2,350 bales of Hexing, 850 bales of Gengfeng, 800 bales of Yuanyi, 2,100 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,950 bales of Xiecheng, 3,550 bales of Fengtai, and 600 bales of Renfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Over 500 bales of yarn were sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively high. It was found that various buyers bought a total of 913 bales, and the selling price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market trended higher because 100,000 dan of coarse cotton were absorbed by the long side. As for the fine cotton market, the selling price was higher than the futures cotton, so new sellers were lacking, the number of chips was slightly dry, and the market price rose. The prices for the sixth, seventh, and eighth months all rose above the three yuan mark.</p>
<p>Fengtai Entered the Market and Absorbed a Large Number</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard cotton market, each month saw an upward trend. Because the long side and gold traders continued to buy and increase their positions, the momentum turned good. However, after the second round, the selling pressure was particularly strong and fatigued. As a result, each month was flat, but the July term rose by 0.1 yuan and the October term fell by 0.05 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, due to the rise in the yarn market, Fengtai newly entered the market and absorbed a large number of long-term positions, causing the platform to dry up and the market price to rise. As a result, each month rose by 0.1, 0.25, and 0.3 yuan compared with the morning closing price. It was found that 3,000 dan of Changfeng were sold, 1,500 dan of Changji, 2,000 dan of Runkang, 2,600 dan of Shengyuan, 1,400 dan of Yongchang, 2,900 dan of Yuanxingchang, 2,100 dan of Jifeng, 1,600 dan of Dafu, 1,800 dan of Yuda, 2,100 dan of Dafeng, 1,700 dan of Shenchang, 1,200 dan of Xincheng, and 1,300 dan of Changhe. 1,500 dan of Tongji were bought, 7,400 dan of Hexing, 1,400 dan of Shenji, 1,900 dan of Yuanyi, 1,400 dan of Taichang, 4,900 dan of Yichang, 1,300 dan of Dachang, 1,700 dan of Yikang, 2,900 dan of Mingde, 4,700 dan of Fengtai, and 2,100 dan of Dachangcheng.

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, each month rose by 2 pounds or fell by 1 pound. News from Liverpool was good. The industry, foreign firms, and local groups bought in. The lack of rain in the east and the lack of sellers were the reasons for the rise in market prices. Unfortunately, there was continued heavy rain in Texas, and the market situation softened. There were few transactions outside the industry. The industry was still watching. Spot demand was quiet. Cloth was more active. There was slight hedging selling before the close. As a result, the spot price rose by 1 pound, and the futures price rose by 1 pound to fall by 4 pounds. British cotton, spot and futures, remained unchanged. Indian cotton, the industry is waiting for foreign developments. Short positions were offset by cotton merchants hedging. The price of Pingguo rose by 0.75 rupee, the price of Mula changed by 0.25 rupee, and the price of Bailuoxi rose by 0.25 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 26th).</p>

<p>(Hankou Correspondent) The cotton yarn market in this city is unusually sluggish. The weather has been sunny for days, and it is the time for successive harvesting of agricultural crops, so all rural areas feel extremely萎缩. The appetite of various wholesale merchants is sluggish, and smuggling is rampant, and they all feel uneasy. Only about 100 to 200 pieces are sold daily. In addition to a price drop of one yuan, the listed prices (including tax) are listed below.</p>

<p>Piece goods and white goods, due to the gradual rise in standard yarn and cotton, the market price is unusually firm. Qingdao fine cloth is lacking in arrivals, and the business is brisk. Daily selling prices are gradually increasing. The price of 14-pound and 12-pound second-grade Shuanglongzhu fine cloth has risen by 7.5 cents per piece compared to three days ago. The spot supply of Lanri fine cloth is tight, and customer demand is still good. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang handled more than 20 packages, and the selling price was 5 cents higher than before. The price of Wufujixiang fine cloth has also risen by 7.5 cents in recent days. The selling prices of the remaining goods are also firm. Local factory fine cloth is squeezed by eastern goods, and sales have shrunk. Currently, only low-end fine cloth can still be traded, but the output has been greatly reduced, and weaving is inclined towards coarse cloth and blank cloth. Currently, the trend of coarse cloth is most smooth for 16-pound and 14-pound cloth. Yesterday, the Guangdong gang exclusively purchased 100 packages of Shenxin 14-pound four-square lotus coarse cloth. Only the Shandong gang handled more than 100 pieces of light-pound coarse cloth.

<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market in each month generally showed a flat and sluggish appearance. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago, recently fell by 1.6 yuan, and in the long term, it fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Canada fell by 0.5 to 0.7 yuan. When the opening price was announced, because the weather had cleared and foreign wheat was also small, the minds of people in each month were not good, so they were not good, and they fell by 0.1 to 0.2 cents compared with the previous day's closing price. There was no intense emotional agitation. In the recent past, the Yingkou gang opened up spot flour, and the market situation was inevitably held back. Therefore, foreign wheat fell so sharply, but the degree of decline was not felt much. Later, there were few sellers, and it was peaceful. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions in each month were not smooth, and the price gradually stabilized, with a recovery of 0.1 yuan. According to the current situation, most people seem to be waiting for the emergence of new wheat before there is a de facto rise and fall.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Futures Wheat Loosens with Foreign News <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month saw a consistent state of loosening and falling. The price of foreign wheat was found to have loosened greatly, and the weather conditions also turned positive. According to the rumors among industry insiders, this year's wheat harvest, in any case, should be better than in previous years, and the increase in production in various places is also greater than in previous years. With this situation, the market atmosphere had a sharp drop. For example, the price of June fell by 0.5 yuan, and the prices of long-term wheat fell by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was still peaceful at first, but later, the flour market turned firm, and the long-term wheat was slightly better by 0.1 to 0.2 cents, while the near-term wheat was still sluggish. Judging from the overall trend, it is difficult for the wheat market to stabilize. The spot wheat market is still seeing deserted transactions, and the price is also flat and lifeless. 270 bags of Yaowan Shandong wheat were opened, and the price was 4.27 yuan, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Rice Market in Hexia Indicates Weakness Amidst Stability <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty consignments arrived from various sources, totaling over six thousand shih (石). Sales at both the wholesale and retail markets remained sluggish, hence the market showed weakness amidst stability.  Thick japonica rice from the Northern Seaboard saw the sale of over five hundred packages, with no significant price fluctuations.  The early rice market remained slow, with minor price adjustments downward.  Thin rice from Dalian sold two to three hundred packages, also at stable prices.  "Du Yang" glutinous rice and "Yin Bian Yuan" ordinary rice were unremarkable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-seven or twenty-eight consignments arrived in Hexia from various routes.  Various types of rice sold moderately well in the market.  White japonica remained flat.  Prices for higher-grade rice were stable, while medium and lower-grade rice prices declined slightly.  Early thin rice sales were stagnant, with slight downward price adjustments.  "Yang Du" indica rice sales were declining, with slightly softer prices.  "Yin Bian Yuan" and rice for export saw minor price increases of three to five fen (分). All other types of rice showed signs of price softening.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Indica Rice Sales Active, Market Price Gradually Increases <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of indica rice remained scarce. As medium and lower grades, along with heat-damaged rice, had already been discounted and sold off, remaining rice was being held in anticipation of better prices.  Merchants from inland provinces and Ningbo, Fujian, and other regions inquired cautiously.  Exports remained active yesterday, and prices gradually increased by four to five fen.  If the supply of indica rice continues without interruption, the rice market may gradually recover.  Yesterday's outgoing shipments included five thousand packages of Jiangxi rice, one thousand two hundred packages of Taiwanese rice, two hundred and fifty-seven packages of Hunan rice, and three hundred packages of Jiangbei rice.  Besides exports, the local businesses handled the transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Fresh Broad Beans from Wenzhou Have Arrived <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Given the weather conditions this spring, with frequent cold and rainy days, yields vary across different regions.  Consequently, the arrival of new produce is later compared to previous years.  Broad beans are among the first to appear on the market, with those from Wenzhou being the earliest.  However, this year, the first fourteen packages arrived via the Sanjiang steamer only yesterday.  Although the quality is good, the beans are relatively small, which has deterred Eastern merchants. Therefore, no initial price was set. It is said that more than one hundred packages are expected to arrive today.  The pricing of these fourteen packages will depend on the quality of today's shipment.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's published section on soybeans, the character "盤" (pan) in "昨市大盤續緊之" (yesterday's market continued tight) was a mistake; it should be "連" (lian). The character "廠" (chang) in "廠帮辦去東北荳之" (factory merchants handle the northeast bean) was mistaken for "客" (ke); this is specially corrected.</p>

<p>The silk market has been particularly dull lately.  Overseas markets have been hampered by frequent declines in Japanese silk, while domestic markets have been unwilling to lower prices due to high silkworm cocoon prices. Consequently, silk transactions have been quite quiet for several days. Yesterday, overseas market conditions remained stable.  Lyon silk prices remained unchanged, while Yokohama futures fell by only one yen.  New York spot goods have stopped being auctioned, and distant December futures have already been sold. The Shanghai silk market continues to maintain its quiet status quo.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Rayon Sees Only Scattered Transactions <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>120 "Tianqiao" brand rayon is priced at over 350 yuan, and over 370 yuan for those transferable inland. Inventories are extremely low, but transactions are very sporadic. There were no transactions in Hangbang rayon, where the price for 120 "Tianqiao" brand rayon is over 380 yuan. Local silk factories purchased several boxes of 120 "Dafugui" brand dull rayon at 390 yuan and several boxes of 120 "Danhu" brand dull rayon at 120 yuan, excluding tax. Yesterday, 3,000 bolts of woven fabric were also sent from North China via the post office.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Green Tea Market Feels Particularly Quiet <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The green tea market from various routes feels quite quiet. Only a few dozen packages of Tunxi "Zhenmei" (Precious Eyebrow) were sent for shipment, priced at 92 yuan. There were no transactions for Suian "Zhenmei." However, it is said that various foreign firms have re-sent telegrams overseas for sales. The superior quality of local "Zhenmei" has led to active transactions, and prices have also stabilized. Wenzhou "Xiaozhenmei" priced at 21 or 22 yuan has been procured by Chinese tea merchants. Also, the "Jinlong" company requested bids for He Kou black tea from "Gongsheng Yong" yesterday, priced at 45 to 47 yuan, similar to the opening price last year. Since the opening of the "Shuizhu" tea market, although various foreign firms have sampled new teas, there has been no response to the telegrams sent to overseas customers. As a result, all firms are refraining from making offers and are maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. The market is said to be very quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Seafood: Arrowroot Powder's Downward Trend Continues, Ample Inventory, Sluggish Customer Sales, No Hope for a Market Reversal in the Short Term <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Due to ample inventory and sluggish customer sales, the arrowroot powder market continues its downward spiral, with no end in sight. Currently, firms with larger inventories are willing to accommodate customers to facilitate sales. However, with sluggish business and a bearish market sentiment, even though firms are willing to cut prices, customers are even more reluctant to purchase. Therefore, the market has been extremely chaotic recently. Yesterday, TT brand No. 2 powder was sold for as low as 10 yuan. "National Flag Qingta" (Green Pagoda) was sold for 10 yuan and 2 jiao (角), and European powder was sold for 12 yuan. According to various dealers' market prices, prices have plummeted by another 5 or 6 jiao compared to last week. However, the upper-grade market is slightly more stable, with "Feiqilin" (Flying Unicorn) at 15 yuan and 8 jiao and "Renqiang" (Man and Gun) at 13 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao, with no one willing to sell for less. Wenzhou powder from "Guoqian" (National Front), special grade is priced at 10 yuan and 8 jiao, first grade at 10 yuan and 4 jiao, second grade at 10 yuan, and third grade at 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Small packages of Dongyang first-grade powder are priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao, but few inquire about them. Given the weakness of the market, there is no hope for a turnaround in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Sugar Market: Sudden Increase in Transactions of "Five Rams" Coarse White Sugar <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed lively momentum. The guild's benchmark price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar remained at 22 yuan, with transshipment goods up by 5 fen, with transactions at 6 yuan and 8 jiao. East Red Sugar saw no fluctuations, with all dealers maintaining original prices. However, there were continued transactions of No. 8 transshipment East White YT brand at 6 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. "Jin Xin," "Dahua," and "Zhen Ji" factory refined white sugar remained at original prices without change, and few supplies of graded goods were released. Only the Chaozhou merchants exchanged ordinary refined red sugar at 11 yuan and 5 jiao, and yellow and green sugar at 9 yuan and 9 jiao, several dozen packages each. There was a lack of other transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the deadline for bidding for the jointly established sugar company. The total quota for Guangdong coarse white sugar and other varieties was 6,321 packages. Bidding prices were as before, and transactions increased. A total of 1,580 packages of "Five Rams" coarse white sugar from the City New Factory were sold at 21 yuan and 8 jiao, 10 packages from the Quxi factory at 21 yuan and 6 jiao, 20 packages of No. 2 refined white sugar at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, and another 40 packages of No. 4 at 20 yuan and 6 jiao. The price for medium granulated white sugar at 19 yuan and 8 jiao was not met.</p>

<p>Recently, the inventory of assorted longan has been gradually depleting, and dealers of upper-grade large-sized goods are reportedly sold out. Therefore, although sales are low, the market remains stable. According to reports, only over thirty boxes have arrived from Jinan, of which large-sized longan account for about one-third, with the remainder being small and medium-sized. They will be released into the market within days. However, small-sized longan is experiencing issues, with over two hundred pieces of Sichuan goods remaining unsold. Recently, asking prices have become increasingly unreasonable, requiring a reduction of over ten yuan compared to spring prices, yet there is still little demand.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Metals: Trade in Pig Lead and Iron Rebounds <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The market for pig lead and iron had previously seen soaring prices due to shortages, with standard prices reaching 30 yuan outside the customs. Subsequently, prices for Japanese goods (i.e., American goods shipped to Osaka and then re-exported to Shanghai) declined as well. Recently, sales have rebounded. Merchants from Hankou have been continuously purchasing, and factories in the city that produce toys and hot water bottles have also been buying, leading to a shortage of circulating goods. The standard price has suddenly risen, increasing from 27 yuan and 5 jiao to 28 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen per case. It is reported that over four hundred cases have been released into the market.</p>

<p>Due to the prolonged lack of fresh shipments, the superior grades of Haikou red leather on the market have been exhausted, and the market is temporarily out of stock. Currently, the market price for Sha red leather is about 57 or 58 yuan, Red Water Green is 41.1 or 2 yuan, and the sales of white leather still show no signs of improvement. There is still sporadic demand for high-quality White Water Green, with the market price at 42 yuan yesterday. Water-treated leather is experiencing the weakest market performance, with prices quoted at 30 yuan but no buyers. This product is no longer well-suited for sales, resulting in stagnation.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Xuzhou Roses Are on the Market <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>According to reports from Xuzhou, fresh flowers have already entered the market. The initial selling price was 160 to 170 wen (文) per market jin (斤), which quickly fell to 80 to 90 wen. Most pickers preserve them in sugar. To dry them, one must wait for sunny weather; otherwise, the flower color easily turns yellow. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain dried goods. Market prices fluctuate according to the weather.</p>

<p>—Guo Xuan</p>
<p>Automobile Inventor</p>
<p>Who hasn't seen the beautiful cars displayed in the glass windows of large automobile companies? "Lincoln Zephyr," "Studebaker," "Buick"... they rush past on the asphalt roads with such style! Even the penniless poor have ridden in long-distance buses or public buses packed like canned goods, haven't they? The dust and the smell of gasoline are indeed unpleasant, but we can now travel in half a day distances that used to take two or three days by mule cart or donkey. How much convenience does this provide us? Especially in China, where railways are few, inland transportation relies almost entirely on this. Now the total length of highways in various provinces is approaching 100,000 kilometers, and we import automobiles worth tens of millions of yuan from abroad every year! Automobiles have truly become essential transportation tools!</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you the story of the automobile's invention:</p>
<p>Long ago, a Frenchman wanted to use machine power to drive a vehicle, but he didn't succeed. He only published his plan in a mechanical magazine. This magazine was seen by a young American worker across the Atlantic Ocean, who was deeply intrigued. He devoted himself to research, investing nearly ten years of effort and encountering countless setbacks. Finally, he built a practical automobile.</p>
<p>Who was this young man? He was Henry Ford, the famous American automobile tycoon of today.</p>
<p>Henry Ford was born in a small village outside the city of Troi in Michigan, USA. His father was a farmer who toiled his entire life and left him three thousand dollars when he died. But Ford had loved playing with machines since he was a child. In school, he loved the manual labor courses the most. So, as soon as he grew up, he immediately joined a steam engine company in Troi as an apprentice. He initially earned two dollars a week. The cost of living in America is very high, so that wasn't enough to support himself. He had to work a night job at a jewelry store, increasing his weekly income to four dollars, barely enough to make ends meet. At this time, he had to work fifteen hours a day, which was really exhausting. But he never forgot his research work. He was planning to start a clock company, planning to produce two thousand clocks every day, each costing 37.5 cents to make and selling for 40 cents on the market. Such a low-priced product would surely be welcomed, and his business would flourish. Most of his companions laughed at his delusion, so although a few people helped him, this ideal company never materialized. However, Ford always believed that if everything was produced in large quantities, it would reduce costs, lower prices, and thus gain a large market.</p>
<p>Because his plan couldn't be realized, Ford despondently returned home and rested for three years.</p>
<p>It was at this time that he read the article by the Frenchman, which deeply aroused his curiosity. He thought that if this kind of machine-powered vehicle could be made, it would be very popular and would greatly benefit society! So, from then on, he devoted himself to researching this invention.</p>
<p>A few dozen days later, he had already prepared a preliminary design, and he immediately went to Troi to buy materials. But on the way, he suddenly thought that if this kind of car could only be used by one or two people, like a bicycle, it wouldn't be anything special. It must be able to carry heavy loads and travel long distances. So, he thought about how to make the machine run more powerfully. He thought that trains were powered by steam, so this kind of car should also be powered by combustion. America produces kerosene, so why not try using kerosene?</p>
<p>From then on, he researched day and night at home. Because he didn't have advanced knowledge of electricity, the equipment for vaporizing and burning gasoline to generate electricity was never properly set up. Many relatives and friends advised him to stop this research to avoid wasting his career. We certainly know that all great inventors in the world have perseverance, and Ford was the same. So, not only did he not listen to others' advice, but he went to Troi to study electricity again.</p>
<p>He rejoined an electrical factory, working night shifts, earning only forty-five dollars a month. One day, the company bought a new machine, but none of the workers could start it. They had no choice but to abandon this great thing. Ford had been working in the factory for five months, and he had a considerable understanding of various machines. It just so happened that he passed by it, and a worker said, "Can you get it to work?" Ford said, "Let me try!" So, he inspected the various structures and felt that there was nothing new. As long as he stepped on it, it would start. He stepped on it with force, and sure enough, the machine started immediately. Because of this, Ford was highly trusted by the factory. His monthly salary increased to one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
<p>He married a wife and bought a house. Next to the house, he built his own laboratory. He worked even harder to experiment with his ideal. Every day after work, he put on his oil-stained work clothes, grabbed a hammer, and went into his laboratory, banging away day and night. Everything comes down to focus. He improved and improved, worked and worked, and finally, one day, his ideal was about to be realized. It was already late at night, and his wife came several times to urge him to sleep, but he always said, "Don't rush me, it's just a little bit more!" So, the hammer rang again. Without realizing it, the long night had passed, and the morning sun had risen from the east. But at this time, Ford's carefully crafted first automobile was completed. Imagine how happy he must have been!</p>
<p>After breakfast, Ford drove this strange-looking car out. People on the road were stunned by this self-propelled monster. Ford just drove forward triumphantly. But when it was time to come back, the machine couldn't turn around. Ford was sweating profusely. The onlookers had to help him turn the car around. Of course, some people laughed at him, saying that he was simply crazy.</p>
<p>From the time Ford began researching and manufacturing automobiles to this time, it had been a full eight years, and he had only achieved this much. Although he hadn't reached complete success, Ford felt confident. Because things were too busy in the factory, and he couldn't spare time for manufacturing and research, he resigned from his factory job to focus on his own business. He still envisioned manufacturing automobiles on a large scale, selling them at low prices, just like the clock company he had dreamed of at the beginning. He immediately went around promoting his plan, seeking investment, believing that such a profitable business would surely attract money. But everyone thought his business was too risky, and no one was willing to invest a single cent!</p>
<p>Ford failed again!</p>
<p>At this time, there was a man named Willington who was also engaged in automobile manufacturing. However, his car was clumsier and larger than Ford's, but otherwise, they were roughly the same. Willington heard that Ford had succeeded and was afraid that Ford would get this profitable business, so he asked Ford for an automobile race.</p>
<p>Ford agreed to his request, and a date was set for the competition. That day, there was a huge crowd, all coming to see the novelty. Willington's car was tall and large, while Ford's car was small and shabby, which was unpleasant to look at. Everyone thought that Ford would definitely fail. At the sound of the command, the two strange cars started racing together. In less than half a li (里), Ford's car had already sprinted forward, leaving Willington far behind. Everyone couldn't help but cheer. Ford received a very warm welcome.</p>
<p>Ford hoped to take this opportunity to advertise to the merchants and realize his plan. But the cunning merchants wouldn't open their wallets until there was a real profit to be made, so Ford's goal still couldn't be achieved. Later, fortunately, a merchant named Couzens was the first to pay Ford a deposit to order the first automobile. This greatly encouraged Ford's courage. Just then, Willington asked for a race again, so Ford and Couzens drove the car and raced. As a result, Ford won again, and Willington had to admit defeat. And the hardworking Ford's luck started to improve from then on. Because of Ford's two victories and Couzens's promotion, merchants from all over America invested in Ford, and the company was established. Ford was the general manager, and his monthly salary was still one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
<p>But this company soon went bankrupt because the shareholders wanted to make more money and conflicted with Ford's ideas. Ford had no capital, and he had a wife and children to feed. At this time, life was extremely difficult. Fortunately, his comrades Couzens and another man named Wills went bankrupt and came to help Ford. Ford hired only two workers, and he himself also wore workers' clothes and worked together with them. At that time, Ford's automobile was already famous, so there were many orders. Half a year later, the number of workers increased to forty. Ford didn't spend much on salaries besides supporting his family because his goal of large-scale production and low-price sales hadn't been achieved yet. Although his automobiles now sold for only nine hundred dollars each, that was already twice as cheap as others' cars.</p>
<p>That winter, the holiday season for settling accounts arrived. Because the market was bad at the time, Ford had bad luck again, and the company lost money and couldn't survive. On that New Year's Day, Ford cried bitterly to the workers, explaining the situation of bankruptcy and expressing his plans and hopes. The workers were very moved and were willing to continue without pay. Ford felt both happy and frustrated. Just then, the European War (Germany and various countries went to war) broke out, and the demand for automobiles greatly increased. Ford's business greatly prospered. Later, the number of workers increased to 16,000. Because Ford was a worker himself, he knew the hardships of labor and was the first to implement the eight-hour workday, breaking the ten-hour workday in American factories. He also increased the wages of workers, with a minimum daily wage of five dollars (equivalent to 17 or 18 yuan in Chinese currency). Factory owners in various countries were astonished, but Ford's business only continued to develop.</p>
<p>At this time, Ford had fully realized his ideal of large-scale production and low-price sales. His hard work had finally paid off!</p>
<p>Today, Ford has become a great American tycoon, with his wealth approaching one hundred million gold dollars. But he has indeed created happiness for many poor workers. There are more than tens of thousands of workers in his factories. Making an automobile requires 7,882 steps. We can imagine how many people are employed. He has set up hospitals, schools, and various sanitation facilities for workers, and he also gives workers bonuses from annual profits. We say that Ford has not only benefited mankind, giving us convenient transportation tools, but can also be said to be a great social revolutionary!</p>
<h3 id="e190">John A. Brashear <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Yahao</p>
<p>Chinese artisans who manufacture gemstone crystal possess high skills, but they only create ornaments for ladies and young women. Foreign artisans, however, can use their skills to discover the secrets of the universe and create human happiness. Zhuangzi said: "If you can safeguard the One, what can be lost? Some use it to dominate, while others cannot escape being adrift and sinking."</p>
<p>(Editor)</p>
<p>Brashear was an American, born in Pittsburgh. He was affable and liked making friends. He often told people, "The value of a person's life depends on the number of friends he makes, and a person's energy should be used to benefit others." He once traveled to China. In his speeches, he often praised China and was very concerned about Chinese education, especially advocating for the establishment of schools for the blind in China.</p>
<p>When he was young, he liked observing celestial bodies. He believed that our eyes cannot see stars that are very far away, so he always wanted to make a tool to penetrate the secrets of space. Indeed, he got an excellent opportunity: when he was eight years old, a man brought a telescope and traveled to his village. He liked it so much that he immediately rented the telescope from the man to take a look at the celestial phenomena. At that time, he felt that the marvels of creation had to be deeply understood. It made him reluctant to sleep every night, pacing around the village with his head raised, paying attention to the arrangement of the stars in the sky. He often told people, "When I grow up, I must study astronomy." He was only eight years old, but he already had the ambition to create happiness for mankind. This is so worthy of our attention!</p>
<p>However, he was born into a poor family and did not have the means to pursue advanced studies. After graduating from middle school, he served in society. At first, he was an apprentice, and three years later he became a moderately experienced mechanic. At the age of twenty, he worked as a low-level mechanic in a steel factory in Pittsburgh. He spent twenty-one years immersed in coal smoke and iron filings.</p>
<p>Comparing his living situation with that of poor Chinese people in China, it can be said that they were equally difficult. However, his spirit is enough to make us admire him. Apart from the time he spent working in the factory, his closest friends were old books and magazines. He studied diligently, sowing the seeds for creating happiness for mankind. He especially paid attention to the phenomena in the sky, so he often looked at the scenery of the sky outside the window on the tram on his way to work and back home. Sometimes, after lunch, he gathered a large group of fellow workers together to chat. During their conversations, he often introduced them to knowledge about the sky. He was also so enthusiastic about worker education.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one, he married Phoebe, who was also a very knowledgeable woman, so they were able to help each other in their research. His success was greatly helped by her. He wanted to build a house, but because his income was not high, he had to do it himself. So after work, he would go back to help her build the house. It took them about a year to build this house.</p>
<p>Soon after she lived with him, she was influenced by his concern for astrology. Their wish was to make their own telescope, so his house gradually became a small factory. Most of the tools he used were made by himself. From then on, they began to grind a piece of glass, working hard day and night. It took them three years to finish grinding the glass piece in the telescope. Truly, even though it is just a piece of glass, grinding it into something that can be used in a telescope is not an easy task! Because if the glass is not spherical or parabolic in curvature, it cannot be used to observe celestial bodies. If there is even a slight mark on the glass, the observation of celestial bodies will be greatly affected. After he ground this piece of glass, he immediately took it to the Pittsburgh Observatory to see Mr. Langley and asked him to teach him how to install it in the telescope tube. Soon, his self-made telescope was successful. He cut a hole in the roof of his house and extended the telescope out. Ah! The vastness of the sky was already in his grasp. Three years of work were completed in one day. How happy they were! That night, happiness overcame fatigue and sleepiness, and they observed through this telescope for an entire night. The next day, he invited many friends, villagers, and fellow workers to share the joy of exploring the mysterious space. Although his telescope was simple, his wish was considered a success. This telescope was only five inches in diameter, and what it could see in the sky could not satisfy this enterprising scientist, so he decided to make an even bigger one.</p>
<p>Later, they ground another piece of glass, twelve inches in diameter. It took another two years. After grinding it, he wanted to apply a thin layer of silver on the glass to reflect strong light. Unfortunately, when he was applying the silver, the glass suddenly broke. This major blow simply stunned him. That day, when he was working in the factory, he looked like a fool. After work, he returned to his home, but he could not find Mrs. Phoebe in the house or in the kitchen. Finally, he found her in his own workshop, where she was starting a fire. At that time, the water in the steam pot was boiling, and a new piece of glass had been installed on his glass grinding machine. She smiled at him and said, "Let's not be discouraged. We just need to make another one, and it has to be better than the broken one." These words seemed to pour oil on the dying embers, reigniting the scientist's vigorous courage. Sure enough, soon they completed an even better piece of glass.</p>
<p>This twelve-inch diameter glass was about the same size as the ones used in famous universities in America. However, its function was even greater! He used his free time to observe the changing phenomena in space through this telescope. At this time, newspapers often published his works, and his success attracted even more attention.</p>
<p>He worked in the factory for twenty-one years. Later, he was hired by the University of Pittsburgh as a professor of astronomy. Ah! It is so rare and honorable for an ordinary mechanic to be promoted to a professor at a university! Later, he even became the president of the University of Pittsburgh. This was nothing more than the result of his hard work. From then on, his genius could be fully developed. At the same time, he opened a factory specializing in the manufacture of astronomical instruments.</p>
<p>There is an American Society of Mechanical Engineers, which is a world-renowned engineering society. He also served as the president of this society, and he was the most admired president.</p>
<p>Grinding glass for astronomical telescopes became his specialty. Because the larger the circumference or the larger the diameter of the glass, the more difficult the grinding process becomes. If there were a six-foot diameter, two-ton glass lens, it would be almost impossible to do it by hand. Now the telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory (six feet in diameter, weighing over two tons) is the crystallization of this scientist's hard work.</p>
<p>In science, the most common unit for measuring length is the meter. But how long is a meter exactly? Scientists want to create a "standard meter ruler" made of platinum-iridium alloy. But before creating the standard ruler, one must know how to determine the length of the standard meter ruler. Scientists want to use the wavelength of light as the standard. But to calculate how many wavelengths of light are equal to one meter, one must use an accurate lens, which is flat, but its degree of "flatness" cannot be off by more than one millionth of an inch (10 inches) from the ideal plane. This is very difficult. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures sought someone to grind this glass, and this scientist was selected and completed this piece of glass.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Reading Movement of the Past Year <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— He Hanguang</p>
<p>The superficiality of academic atmosphere in our country cannot be denied by anyone. And the number of domestic cultural organizations devoted to this area of work is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. In the past year, only the reading movement led by the China Cultural Construction Association has been able to make some effort in promoting reading.</p>
<p>Last year, the Cultural Construction Association initiated the National Reading Movement Conference and the National Reading Competition. The content of the Reading Movement Conference included: one, uniting major publishing institutions across the country to sell their books at half price; two, inviting academic experts to broadcast speeches guiding reading. The effect is unknown, but observing the crowded bookstores during the conference, it may be that there were quite a few people who purchased books and paintings due to the reading movement!</p>
<p>However, this Reading Movement Conference was ultimately more abstract. It may have had considerable power in creating a reading atmosphere, but the effectiveness is ultimately difficult to measure. The Reading Competition was more practical and had a more concrete performance record. Moreover, the extent to which the Reading Competition's results were excellent can also reveal the extent to which Chinese youth generally love to learn.</p>
<p>In the methods of the Reading Competition, there are several points that deserve our special attention. Now I will excerpt them as follows:</p>
<p>1. Registration locations: There are twenty-five locations, including the branches of the Cultural Construction Association in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, Rehe, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Shanxi, Chahar, and the Northeast.</p>
<p>2. Registration procedures: Fill out two forms, provide three two-inch photos; those who live far away can register by mail; there is no fee; and after joining, you can enjoy a 50% discount when purchasing books from various bookstores.</p>
<p>3. Prizes: Cash or book prizes will be awarded to the top 30 in the university group and the top 30 in the middle school group.</p>
<p>In these methods, it can be said that they are quite perfect, with considerable benefits, and the only obligation is reading. But what were the results of the organization? A glimpse can be seen in the Cultural Construction Association's statistical report:</p>
<p>Registered members: 3,126 in the university group, 2,663 in the middle school group</p>
<p>Members who took the exam: 46 in the university group, 74 in the middle school group</p>
<p>Final score: 88.71 points in the university group, 91.5 points in the middle school group</p>
<p>Lowest score: 38.85 points in the university group, 9.83 points in the middle school group</p>
<p>The fact that the total number of registered members in the country, including both university and middle school groups, is only 5,789 is astonishing enough, but the fact that only 120 members from both university and middle school groups took the exam makes us speechless. Although there are various special reasons for this, we cannot help but acknowledge the scarcity of those who love to learn. And the fact that the best and worst scores are unsatisfactory also goes without saying.</p>
<p>The author believes that although the work of this Reading Competition of the Cultural Construction Association was not successful, it was not wasted at all, and it obtained a great factual lesson, which is how indifferent the general youth of the country are to reading. So not only can we not stop our work because of the poor results of the Reading Competition, but we should also firmly believe that encouraging academic studies and promoting reading are the only urgent tasks for China at present!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Ancient Chinese Economic Thought and System <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhengzhi</p>
<p>Written by Tageki Jin-i, translated by Wang Xuewen, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Studying ancient Chinese economic thought and systems is a very difficult task. Its research methods are nothing more than starting with the following three methods: one is based on ancient historical records, organized and analyzed inductively, and then a general concept is obtained. The second is to focus on the excavation of ancient artifacts, using various methods of geology to study and deliberate, and discover some fragmentary facts of ancient times. Over the years, a correct conclusion can be reached. The third is to refer to ancient historical records, select them, distinguish their authenticity, and then compare the discovered artifacts with each other, and after a thorough investigation and research, make a hypothetical conclusion for future generations to continue to research. These three methods do not contradict each other, but complement each other, and from the perspective of research achievements, they are equally difficult and equally effective.</p>
<p>However, the number of Chinese people engaged in this kind of research is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. In a history of world culture, the part about China is still a question mark until now. This is definitely not because Chinese scholars are not progressing, but also because objective reasons have determined it. Political instability, social instability, and the failure to promote the encouragement of academic work all affect the inability to carry out research work. Here, we read Mr. Tageki Jin-i's "Ancient Chinese Economic Thought and System", and we should truly feel ashamed!</p>
<p>Academic work is of course global and knows no national boundaries, but if Chinese people do not study Chinese affairs themselves, but foreign scholars are diligently engaged in it, we are ultimately overwhelmed with remorse and shame.</p>
<p>Mr. Tageki Jin-i's "Chinese Economic Thought and System" uses the first research method that the author mentioned above, which is based on ancient historical records for organization, analysis, and induction. However, in addition to using Chinese ancient books as the main research material, he also compares it with ancient European historical facts for collateral evidence.</p>
<p>In this book, the author's efforts to study one point are, as stated in the "Conclusion": "In ancient and modern times, the ideas of primitive peoples mostly use land and agriculture to symbolize women, and this was also the case in ancient China. For example, women or femininity are used to symbolize land and agriculture; and the orientation and place of worship of such deities adopt the female or feminine approach. …And the characteristics of this kind of thinking are manifested in various ritual systems, and from the official system related to land and agriculture to the system policy, everything is governed by it. It is unnecessary to say that anyone who studies ancient Chinese economic history should not ignore this fundamental idea. …The examination of the development of feudal organization and land system based on this idea accounts for almost half of this article. …" In these few sentences that we excerpt, we can regard them as the main purpose of the author in writing this book: one is the characteristics of ancient Chinese economic thought and institutional organization—namely, feminism—and the other is the economic organization and system based on this characteristic.</p>
<p>For these two points, the author has spent a lot of effort on them, and it is still a hypothetical conclusion—of course, it cannot be said to be a definitive conclusion, which is enough to prove the difficulty of ancient cultural research, and it is very sufficient as an important reference book for those who are interested in studying ancient culture. The book contains 200,000 words, 346 pages, translated by Wang Xuewen, and is priced at two yuan and forty cents, published by Commercial Press.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are equally important, and even more so. Therefore, even if the people of our country are not yet qualified to step into the stage of constitutional government, the general intellectuals are already eagerly demanding universal politics. And the Chinese Kuomintang also complied with this demand and promulgated the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>In this draft constitution, of course, the political system of the Republic of China is meticulously stipulated on it. When the National Assembly is held on November 12, once it is passed, this political system will be immediately realized. How should we, the general public who demand democracy, research and discuss it now that this political system has been drafted but not yet implemented?</p>
<p>If we want to study the political system, in addition to basing it on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideology and the actual experience of the current National Government's five-yuan system, the author believes that it is especially necessary to have a deep understanding and study of the political systems of various countries in the world. Human progress is due to not treading the detours of predecessors; the facts of the past and present are our guiding lights, so the book "Political Systems of Various Countries" jointly compiled by Yang Youjiong and Fu Biao is truly necessary to recommend to you, readers!</p>
<p>In this book of only about 120,000 words, the richness of quality is worth our extraordinary surprise. First, it describes the evolution of various countries; then, it describes the current political institutions of various countries, the origin and rise and fall of the countries; and the functions and composition of their entire political organizations, such as legislative, executive, and judicial institutions; and the nature and rise and fall of political parties; all are briefly explained, so after reading this book, we can have a clear understanding of the national conditions of various countries, the causes and consequences of the changes in political systems, and the current status of political organizations. After having this basic understanding, and then looking back at the current situation in China, and the provisions on the draft constitution, we can not only get a comparative observation, but also get an accurate conclusion that can evaluate its right and wrong, as long as you have some basic knowledge of politics and economics.</p>
<p>At the same time, I feel that this book should not only be introduced to general university and middle school students, but should also be introduced to the general public, because if you want to be a perfect citizen and fulfill your responsibilities as a citizen, you must have basic civic training. This book can be said to be a must-read for every citizen, especially now that the draft constitution has been promulgated but not yet implemented. The book contains 120,000 words, 314 pages, and is priced at 90 cents, published by Zhonghua Book Company.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Gonorrhea Should Be Treated Jointly by Husband and Wife <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— (Jing Qing)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is contagious, and direct transmission between husband and wife is the fastest. If a husband contracts gonorrhea from promiscuous activities and does not receive proper treatment or follow the correct health regimen, the wife will also become infected. Those who do not understand the situation often regard leucorrhea in women as normal and neglect treatment. Inevitably, both husband and wife will suffer from chronic gonorrhea, which will linger indefinitely. Although the pain may be infrequent, the aftereffects are worrisome, leading to lifelong infertility and a multitude of ailments. Moreover, if the husband recovers but the wife becomes infected, and vice versa, the disease will be transmitted back and forth, deepening the root of the illness day by day. Therefore, when both men and women are infected with gonorrhea, if a thorough cure is desired, both husband and wife must be treated jointly. Currently, for men infected with gonorrhea, taking "Gonadoten" internally is the simplest and most effective method. However, when women are infected with gonorrhea, they often fail to understand the severity of the situation and are reluctant to seek medical treatment. By the time the virus erupts or harms their children, it is too late. Therefore, if a man has infected his wife with gonorrhea, he should promptly purchase and take "Internal Leucorrhea Pills" and simultaneously use "External Leucorrhea Medicine." Then the cure of the disease can be assured, and mutual infection can be avoided. All of the above-mentioned medicines are sold at the Tongren Western Pharmacy at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, this city. Each type is generally sold for two yuan per box.</p>

<p>Although freckles are a painless condition, they are unsightly when they appear on the face, especially for women. I have suffered from this condition for over ten years and have sought medical treatment repeatedly, but with little success. I thought there was no way to remove freckles in the world. Since "Mianli" came out, its quality has been excellent and its effects have been remarkable. Therefore, everyone knows to inquire about it. Last winter, I also wrote to the Shanghai Tongren Western Pharmacy to purchase two bottles, and used them as directed. The freckles I suffered from have been eliminated by about 80-90%. I am overjoyed. Statistically speaking, I only exchanged a good face for the price of two yuan. It can be said that it is worth it, and the function of "Mianli" is so incredible. It truly deserves to be praised as the king of beauty products and an indispensable dual-purpose good medicine in household cosmetics. I think there are many young men and women who suffer from freckles and hate them. I dare to represent them and speak out for those who suffer from freckles.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Regarding the Treatment of Ringworm <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— (Cong Lie)</p>
<p>Scabies and ringworm have insects that penetrate deep into the skin, irritating the skin. They easily occur on the finger joints and other places, with small blisters and nodules appearing locally, causing severe itching. Tinea capitis is caused by filamentous fungi and mostly grows in the hair, rarely in other parts, which is commonly known as favus. Tinea corporis is caused by a type of bacteria that invades the skin, causing red circular shapes, such as tinea cruris and tinea corporis, which are also sometimes itchy and easily spread. In view of this, the first priority in treating ringworm is to kill bacteria, eliminate the nests of microorganisms, and curb their growth and spread. If this is done, then ringworm can be cured. "Ganlu Medicinal Water" is issued by Shanghai Fada Road Xixinqiao Street, Dexing Lane No. 1 Tongren Western Pharmacy. It has the function of killing bacteria, relieving itching, disinfecting, and preventing corrosion. Its effect is extremely fast. It can be said to be the standard medicine for treating ringworm in modern times. Even other skin moisture, swelling, and poison, urticaria, scabies, etc., apply this medicine, and all have very significant effects.</p>
<h3 id="e196">On Remedying Neurasthenia <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— (Qiren)</p>
<p>The brain is the master of thinking, and the reproductive organs are in charge of reproduction. The former is the function of the spirit, and the latter is the creation of matter. The relationship between them is very close. Therefore, the greater the use of thinking power, the more the reproductive power will decline. The more the use of reproductive power, the greater the consumption of semen. And the abilities of thinking and memory will be weakened. Symptoms of neurasthenia, such as spermatorrhea, impotence, premature ejaculation, etc., will arise in droves. Young people in the world often indulge in carnal desires without realizing their excess, or mistakenly commit masturbation, indulging their emotions without realizing the harm. These are all due to not understanding the principles of physiology and hygiene. The only way to remedy this is to use a firm will to curb masturbation and cut off desires. For internal medicine, the "Xirukang" pills sold by Shanghai French Concession, Xixinqiao Street, Dexing Lane No. 1 Tongren Western Pharmacy are the most effective. The price is two yuan per bottle of 40 pills. If you take six pills of this medicine every day, the function of the brain and nerves will gradually become stronger, and the function of the reproductive organs will gradually recover. Otherwise, if you continue to indulge in desires, you will gradually enter a dangerous situation that is difficult to save. What a pity!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Excellent Stomach Pain Medicine <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— (Shuyun)</p>
<p>In recent years, new drugs have emerged endlessly, but they are of uneven quality. When doctors use them, they often regret that they cannot get what they want. For example, there are hundreds of kinds of medicines for stomach diseases on the market, causing doctors and patients to feel at a loss. However, "Wei Biling", produced by Shanghai Tongren Western Pharmacy, has no bad habits of being unworthy of its name in treating stomach pain and stomach diseases. The medicinal properties are stable and the efficacy is accurate, which is beyond the reach of generally sold over-the-counter drugs. Once taken, everyone admires the medicine's efficacy. Moreover, it does not contain any anesthetic or toxic substances, and continuous use will never lead to habituation. Those who suffer from stomach disease and have unbearable pain, or acid regurgitation and heartburn, or vomiting after eating, will be quickly cured after taking "Wei Biling."</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Hazards of Gonorrhea <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— (Dong)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is extremely harmful. If it is not treated and cured in time, it will develop into various complications, and the disease will worsen and become difficult to treat. For example, it can change from acute to chronic, from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra, and it can also invade the rectum to cause rectal gonorrhea. It can also be complicated by epididymitis, urethral stricture, prostatitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, spermatic cord inflammation, and so on. The occurrence of this disease is due to the invasion of gonococcal diplococci, which causes inflammation of the urethral mucosa. If treatment is sought early during the initial infection, other mixed symptoms can be avoided. Otherwise, if the disease is prolonged or medication is taken carelessly, it can lead to lifelong harm. Some people transmit the disease to their wives and children. The suffering of the illness is prolonged, which not only wastes time and abandons work, but also cuts off the lineage. The depth of the disaster it causes is like this. In recent times, the treatment of gonorrhea often involves taking "Gonatoden" internally. This medicine is in pill form and has the major effects of penetrating membranes, killing bacteria, reducing inflammation, eliminating swelling, promoting diuresis, and detoxifying. The speed with which it takes effect after taking it is often unexpected. Those who are newly infected with gonorrhea can take it to quickly eradicate the root cause. Even chronic gonorrhea that has lasted for many years can be easily effective. It truly makes a great contribution to doctors and patients. This medicine sells for two yuan per box and is distributed by Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinxiao Street, French Avenue, Shanghai.</p>

<p>— (Fuchen)</p>
<p>Eczema can be acute or chronic. If acute eczema is treated incorrectly, it will turn into chronic eczema, which will be prolonged and require a lot of effort. Conversely, if the treatment is correct, it is not difficult to recover in a short time. The onset of eczema is caused externally by skin irritation and internally by diseases of the nerves and kidneys. The causes are different, and the symptoms are also different. Some start only with erythema and swelling, and then develop into papules, blisters, and pustules, which eventually form scales and produce epidermis. Others start with erythema and pustules, and then develop into scattered and clustered papules. It is extremely itchy, especially when it is hot. The earlier the treatment, the better. "Ganlu" lotion, produced by Shanghai Tongren Pharmacy, has the ability to remove dampness, relieve itching, reduce inflammation, and reduce swelling. Once applied, it immediately feels comfortable and pleasant, and the disease is relieved. One bottle is enough to cure the disease. As for its fragrant smell, clear color, fresh ingredients, and correct combination, these are just minor matters. It is truly an outstanding product among eczema medicines. It is also effective for various skin diseases, such as scabies. It is said that each bottle sells for one yuan.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Xia Jianping of Fuyang) A month ago, I returned to my hometown from Shanghai and bought two bottles of "Mianli" cream to bring back with me. I originally intended to give it to my wife as a makeup aid. My wife was very happy to receive it, but because it was quite precious, she gave one bottle to her friend, Ms. Ye. Half a month later, Ms. Ye suddenly came to thank her and asked where it was sold. My wife told her that it was sold by Shanghai Tongren Pharmacy. When asked why she liked it so much, she said, "Don't you see that the freckles on my face have faded a lot?" "Mianli" is truly a good product. Looking at her, it was indeed true. Although my wife does not suffer from freckles, her belief and love for it have also increased. The two of them then jointly purchased three more bottles from the post office. My wife applies it after each makeup session, and she feels especially radiant. And Ms. Ye's freckles completely disappeared two weeks later. This is something I witnessed, so I firmly believe that its effectiveness is truly accurate.</p>

<p>— (Xiangqi)</p>
<p>Food enters the mouth, passes through the esophagus, and reaches the stomach. Although the stomach is an internal organ, it is in constant contact with external food every day. Therefore, one should usually eat sparingly and drink cautiously to avoid becoming a source of stomach problems in order to maintain good health. However, if the mouth or teeth are diseased, resulting in insufficient chewing, or if one eats or drinks excessively, too hot or too cold, or has unusual preferences for spicy foods, vinegar, or alcohol, or if one's diet is irregular or untimely, or if one runs and jumps wildly immediately after eating, all of these physical and chemical stimuli in the stomach can cause stomach problems. Once stomach problems occur, one either feels indigestion, fullness in the chest and abdomen, or pain and discomfort, or belching and acid reflux. In minor cases, it hinders work, and in severe cases, it causes vomiting and harms the body. All those who suffer from stomach problems feel this pain. Among the stomach remedies sold in the market, I have tried many times, and only "Wei Biling" is effective. This medicine has all the functions of various digestive enzymes, and it has the effect of neutralizing excessive secretions in the stomach. It is especially effective in relieving pain and stopping vomiting, and it contains no toxic substances. This "Wei Biling" is sold by Tongren Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinxiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai. Each box costs one yuan. Those who suffer from stomach problems will find it worthwhile to purchase and take.</p>

<p>— Jiawei</p>
<p>The development of events sometimes requires waiting for the arrival of time; however, the progress of time never waits for you for even a minute or a second!</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that during the summer vacation of the previous two sessions, the graduates of various universities in Peking, under the situation of "graduation means unemployment", initiated the organization of the "Professional Alliance". However, as for their subsequent development and results, I have heard little about it and do not know the details.</p>
<p>However, our "Old Man Time" has not been idle and has not been lenient at all: spring has gone, summer has come; then, inevitably, the summer vacation of various schools will also arrive - it is another session!</p>
<p>Although everyone knows that our society is already filled with "excess" (?) job seekers and there is nowhere to accommodate them. "Graduation means unemployment" has become an inevitable trend of the times! However, the students in the shuttle cannot not graduate and leave school, right?</p>
<p>Really, it is another session! The students who are about to graduate must leave the school gate (in fact, the school cannot accommodate them either) and enter the society! Sure enough, it is here again, another "Service Alliance" is still in Peking. According to reports: The Peking University Graduates Service Movement Alliance of this session is scheduled to be established at Chaoyang University on the 26th. It also issued a declaration, which mainly stated: "This service movement is not only for employment, but should continue to demand appropriate solutions to the problem of youth's future, and declare that the motive of the movement is pure..."</p>
<p>We have heard the call to "save the children"; now there are still people shouting to "save the middle school students"! In this way, today, it may be further developed to "save the college students"!</p>
<p>Really, according to the statistics obtained by the Ministry of Education's order to investigate in order to prepare for the relief of unemployed college students, the total number of unemployed graduates from colleges and above in the country in the two years of 1933 and 1934 reached as many as 9,622. This is nearly ten thousand, and it is only the number of people in the previous three years! Adding the current and previous two sessions... it is an alarming number, that is certain!</p>
<p>Here, perhaps our "scholars" will again attribute it to the "incompetence" of the general youth students, but think about it, in today's situation where "graduation means unemployment", who has obtained any guarantee?</p>
<p>Finally, the students of various universities in Peking have consciously organized the "Service Movement Alliance". Sure enough, under the current situation, we cannot expect too much good results from their movement, but we cannot deny the "historical significance" of their movement. Isn't it? Their "pure motives", "not only for employment, but also to continue to demand appropriate solutions to the problem of youth's future"!</p>
<p>Originally, no one would deny that under the current fragmented situation, everything has become a "problem", and at the same time, all problems cannot escape the relationship with society. Moreover, the development of things needs to wait for the opportunity; however, the progress of time will never wait. Young people must seize the historical opportunity and move forward!</p>
<h3 id="e204">About Small Theaters <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>This is a gratifying piece of news, saying that there are several friends in Shanghai who are working hard on the drama movement and are organizing a weekly experimental small theater, and it has been decided to hold the first public performance at Xinguang on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>For several years, spoken drama has been in decline for a long time, but this year, spoken drama suddenly seems to be more lively. In the short period of five months, many drama troupes have performed publicly. However, in any case, due to various restrictions on time and space, spoken drama has not yet penetrated the vast masses, which no one dares to deny.</p>
<p>Small theaters have been popular in European and American countries for a long time. The so-called small theater, Little Theatre, is produced out of love for drama. Although the styles are different, the nature is common. The difference between small theaters and general theaters is that the performances are divorced from profit-oriented dramas, and the focus is on trial performances, adopting the repertoire system, Repertoire System. Because ordinary theaters aim at profit, whichever script sells well, they will perform it for a few more days, and if it does not sell well, they will stop performing it. As a result, if there is no box office appeal, even a very good script will be stopped after two or three days. Therefore, how many scripts are performed in a year, and how many days a certain script is performed, is not specified in advance, and everything is determined by objective conditions. As for small theaters, it is not like this. How many scripts are performed in a year has already been arranged in advance, and they are performed accordingly. Even if a certain script has a great box office appeal, the number of days scheduled for the performance will never be extended. On the contrary, even if the box office appeal is very small, it will still be performed according to the catalog.</p>
<p>The small theater originated from Andre Antoine's Free Theatre in France. In the thirty years since then, the entire history of drama can be said to be centered on small theaters. In fact, all the new arts of modern drama, such as light, color, stylization, and synchronization, can only be realized by small theaters. Inspired by Antoine's Free Theatre, Strindbery realized a small stage and a small number of audiences. He established a family theater in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. In his book "The Art of Drama", he said to us about small theaters like this: "The smaller the theater, the better; the simpler the stage, the better; the more natural the acting, the better; the fewer the characters, the better; the shorter the number of acts, the better; and one-act plays without scene changes are even better. Just one table and two or three chairs, and three or two excellent actors can express the most profound, sharp, and complex soul conflicts that have never been seen on the stage before two or three hundred educated audiences. In the past, in order to make the faces of the performers look better (in fact, uglier), the footlights that were used must be abolished, and only sidelights should be used to illuminate the stage. The act of the actors coming to the front of the stage to greet the audience should be abolished, the stage and the audience seats can be made the same height, and the habit of showing teeth and eating in the dark of the audience seats should be eliminated. The actors' faces do not need to be smeared with makeup, and the stage decoration must have scientific truth." His small theater plan was passed on to Germany, where Max Reinberdt founded the indoor theater, and then passed on to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia, all of which made considerable contributions to drama.</p>
<p>Now the stage people in Shanghai are also starting to experiment with small theaters; hearing this news, it seems like getting a new kind of excitement: at the same time, there are endless hopes for this newborn. First, we hope that the small theater will reduce the seat price to a very low level, so that everyone who loves spoken drama can have the opportunity to appreciate the art of drama; at the same time, we also hope that this kind of small theater can exist permanently, performing all year round, and increase from one to countless, so that spoken drama can penetrate into the vast crowd.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Snake Catcher <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>—A Story on the Road—</p>
<p>A sampan boat has just arrived at the dock, with a husband and wife on board. Their boat is so simple, unlike the other sampan boats that are stationed there all year round, some of which live by fishing, some of which make toys, or sell various children's food. Therefore, after the boat arrived, it attracted the attention of their fellow villagers. They, who travel all over the world, often want to inquire about news from their hometown from their fellow villagers, although they know that their hometown is always trapped in floods and famines. Now, a sampan boat that does not even have the tools to make a living has arrived, and they will immediately recall the year they fled, could it be that their hometown has had another major flood? They all surrounded the husband and wife kindly to inquire about the hometown news they wanted to know.</p>
<p>But that couple, like them, had been fleeing from their hometown for many years, and their simple sampan boat had also floated through the small towns of Jiangnan. They did not know anything about the news from their hometown.</p>
<p>The next day, the man also went ashore to do business. He was good at catching snakes and sold a medicine to relieve snake venom. He was carrying a specially made small basket in his hand, with a few dying snakes coiling in the basket, and shouting along the way: "Do you want to catch snakes? Do you want to catch snakes?"</p>
<p>It was a small town in Jiangnan. During the plum rain season, it was not uncommon to find a snake raising its head and wriggling in the corner of someone's wall or under the stove. Sometimes, when walking through a narrow street, a snake would suddenly jump out of the stone crevice under the eaves and scare passersby. When the snake catcher was discovered on the street, someone immediately invited him to catch snakes. He went into people's houses, lay down and crawled along the walls, as if his nose could smell where the snakes were hiding. Wherever there were cracks or small holes, he would apply the antidote he sold on his fingers, reach into the hole to grope, and whistle in his mouth. Within a few minutes, a snake would bite his finger and be caught. He did not accept people's money, only wanted to buy his antidote, but he wanted the snake he caught. He held it by the tail and slammed it hard, hiding it in the bamboo basket. According to him, the antidote was made from snake meat and a medicinal material.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In just two days, everyone in the town knew that he was a snake catcher. People who wanted to catch snakes came to the dock early to invite him. The town's richest man invited him to catch snakes everywhere in their high-rise buildings and gardens. He always smelled cautiously with his nose. As long as his hand reached into the hole, he could catch the snake.</p>
<p>He told people: he grew up in the deep mountains since he was a child. He had no father or mother. A huge snake raised him. He lived with snakes every day. Now his nose can especially smell the scent of snakes. In this way, he was regarded as a god, because in those unofficial histories, tigers or human bears often raised an abandoned child, and that child would always be a hero.</p>
<p>The man was busy catching snakes from house to house every day, and he simply couldn't spare himself. A week later, the sampan boat suddenly disappeared. Their fellow villagers did not know where the couple had floated to. But the next day, the town's water patrol team escorted them back to the town. They were thieves on the road. They used the opportunity of catching snakes to peep into people's storage places and steal. Many stolen goods were found on the sampan boat, all of which were stolen in the town within a week.</p>
<p>The snake-catching god was then put in jail.</p>

<p>— Mu Ye</p>
<p>"Damn it, look; look at your pathetic state: how did you manage to get like this? How did you manage to get like this?… I’m asking you! Are you half-dead already? You, you……"</p>
<p>Zhu Da Pangzi (Big Fatty Zhu) was already sweating profusely, his brown face plus the flushed red color, really resembled the roasted meat in the barbecue shop next door! He used his fat hands to wipe the sweat from his head and face, then flicked it onto the ground with a "sha" sound. At the same time, he rudely stretched out his other hand and grabbed the child's ear, pulling it twice as long.</p>
<p>"...Five… jiao… ocean (cents) Ow! Ow!…"</p>
<p>The sallow-faced child was shaking open an old imitation silk robe with holes in it, spiritless, feebly yelling. Unprepared, his ear was suddenly grabbed, and a wave of old spasms arose on his face. His eyes also moistened. He cried out, "Ow! Ow!"</p>
<p>"Humph! I thought you were dead, you son of a bitch! Huh?… You know how to say 'Ow,' huh! You're something else!… Damn it, can't you shout louder? Huh, you're not a young lady… Quick! Put some energy into it! Damn it……"</p>
<p>As Zhu Da Pangzi spoke, he flicked the sweat on his fat hand directly onto the sallow face with a "sha" sound. The child seemed not to notice, not even blinking, only raised one hand to touch his hot, reddened ear. After hesitating for a while, he shook open a pair of faded red trousers.</p>
<p>"Eh… eh yo! One pair… pret… ty… red… pan…ts…"</p>
<p>The voice was still so soft, hoarse and weak, and even carried a crying tone!</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, shout louder!… Look, you pathetic wimp!… Are you just eating for nothing? Look at them, look! Open your dead eyes, come on, come on! You……"</p>
<p>Indeed, things were not like this on the other side! Not to mention anything else, there were at least fifty or sixty people piled up at the entrance of the shop: there were also ten or so people picking and choosing things there. This really made Zhu Da Pangzi very uncomfortable, as if something were biting at his heart. The people on that side were standing on a tall counter painted shiny and bright. Furthermore, there were two people wearing colorful clothes, much better than the sallow-faced child on this side! They were gesticulating, jumping around, and even stomping on the counter, making it bang: like two fish, their voices were even better, almost as loud as a radio. Listen:</p>
<p>—Hey, hey! This cheongsam, hey! Look, everyone! One ocean! Brand new item, it would cost at least twenty ocean to make a new one! Only buying for one ocean, such a bargain!</p>
<p>—Look carefully, observe carefully! Cheap things are inside!</p>
<p>—Hey, hey! Look at these trousers, on sale cheap! Hey, hey! Sturdy and beautiful! Hey, hey! Selling for only eight jiao (80 cents), eight jiao!</p>
<p>—Observe carefully, look carefully, there are really a lot of cheap things!</p>
<p>—Hey, hey! You… so many, half an ocean!</p>
<p>—Really a lot! Really a lot! If you want to sell, I’ll help you find it!</p>
<p>—Hey, hey!……</p>
<p>"Look, look at them, open your dead cunt eyes, look at them……"</p>
<p>Zhu Da Pangzi shouted, panting with anger. What made him sad was being overshadowed by them, not having any business at all.</p>
<p>"Eh, yo eh! This shirt… three… jiao… zero… eight… fen (cents)…"</p>
<p>Zhu Da Pangzi got even angrier, wiping his sweat twice and flicking it "sha! sha!" onto the sallow face. He quickly went up and grabbed the child's ear again, this time pulling the child all the way to the ground. He pounded with his fists, cursing all the while.</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, I'm telling you to be half-dead, I'm beating you! Beating you for being like this! Useless, useless! Look at them, look at them……"</p>
<p>People on the street were laughing. Over there, the shouting got even louder and louder! In the voices, it seemed to be mixed with a layer of laughter—as if laughing at Zhu Da Pangzi,</p>
<p>"I, I can't stand it anymore! Can't sleep at night, always shouting like this!… They, they have a lot of people, and they're all adults; I… I can't stand it, I……" After a long time, the sallow-faced child said, sobbing.</p>
<p>"Look, look at your pathetic cunt-like appearance… What are you good for?… Huh?…"</p>
<p>Fists pounded thumpingly on his back!</p>
<p>What to do? Over there, it's so lively, their voices are so good, their shouts are so loud, their feet stomping on the counter making a "dong, dong" sound, so pleasant to hear, like beating a big drum. There are so many people gathered around, but there's no one here, even the hoarse-voiced sallow face is lying on the ground, only able to moan, unable to shout anything.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I just can't accept it, I don't care, business is for everyone! Damn it, I'll do it myself! Let's see who can beat who?……" Zhu Da Pangzi flicked away several handfuls of sweat with a "sha sha" sound, maliciously glanced at the other side, and moved the table forward himself. Then, he placed a stool on the table. Thus, Zhu Da Pangzi, panting with anger, climbed up, making the table creak! creak! He desperately shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! We really have cheap things here! Hey! Hey! Come on over! Here… come over!!! You come… look!!! These pan…ts are bran…d new!… Selling for… only two mao (20 cents)… ocean!!!…… They sell things that are all… all bad… things… old goods taken from the… pawn…shops! Hey!… Hey… I… here………"</p>
<p>Zhu Da Pangzi shouted desperately, veins bulging out on his head! Later, he also jumped, he jumped on the small stool! Stomping on the stool making a "deng deng" sound. He was almost turning into a pair of crazy beasts! Sweat flowed down his face, and he kept flicking it away! Finally! He was too excited, tears falling from his eyes, not knowing if it was by accident or what, he fell headfirst from the stool perched on the big table, and fainted! He happened to fall on the sallow-faced child, who only moaned!</p>
<p>Over there, they shouted again:—</p>
<p>—This one! Hey, hey!… Look, look!… Half an ocean! Extremely cheap! Hey, hey! Come on! Too late, you won't get it!</p>
<p>—Look carefully, observe carefully! Cheap things are inside!</p>

<p>— By Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Sound effects:… Trains speeding along, whistles blowing, people constantly talking in the carriages, waiters from the dining car and vendors calling out to customers to buy food, many passengers, some begging for food, some buying snacks, shouting east and west, a chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Note:… The above section has no fixed dialogue; actors should improvise individually. The most important thing is to avoid making the atmosphere in the carriage too much like a lively temple fair, and to naturally express the real emotions of the train; the actors should be positioned at different distances to create a sense of near and far; actors should avoid interrupting each other, and avoid more than two people speaking at the same time.</p>
<p>Order:… The "vendor" calling out starts from far away and gets closer as the sound effects begin.</p>
<p>Passengers in the distance buy beef, bread, eggs, dried tofu, and chicken cakes.</p>
<p>Passengers nearby shout for the "vendor" to come closer to buy the above items.</p>
<p>The "dining car waiter" nearby asks passengers what they want to eat, and boasts about the delicious and cheap dishes.</p>
<p>Passengers order fried rice, bread, coffee, cocoa, and large dishes, etc.</p>
<p>"Vendor 1 and" the dining car waiter go further away, the sound of passengers talking and the train moving becomes a cacophony.</p>
<p>(Passenger conversations should not be too loud)</p>

<p>The spring breeze of February brings a fresh atmosphere. Heavenly winds carry the sound of chanting. I raise my head and gaze far beyond the clouds. There is a ladder to the clouds, reachable by foot. I see it, a Peng bird soaring ten thousand miles, happily achieving its ambitions. Rising straight up, riding the green clouds. All because of the generous support of the east wind. Showing its flair and standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p>The skirt of a fairy, leaving behind swallows. A few refined sounds harmonize with the orioles. I don’t know where the sound of Xiao and Sheng comes from. This music is not from heaven. It is said that the beauty sings and dances with skill. Look at how gracefully she looks like the shadow of a startled wild goose. Light as a flying swallow in the air. Just like Cai Wenji with her Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute. Just like Xiang Ling playing the zither with a clear sound. Just like Zhao Jun's Lament on the Pipa. Just like the talented thief stealing the box with red coins. Look at her, the sleeves and hem of her silk dress fluttering. Her light silk clothes are pure and without dust. A pair of jade steps dance with the wind. Learning from Zhao Feiyan, her figure is light. All because of the teasing of mischievous young boys. Preventing Green Pearl from becoming a person who falls from a building. Only fearing that the willow branch is too weak and without strength. Therefore, a strand of red silk ties her ankle. Sometimes, the wind topples her over. Like Yang Guifei taking a bath. Not knowing the true face of Lushan Mountain. Where to find a soulmate in this world. If one day she falls into the dusty world of Luoyang, it will arouse. How many onlookers, so, stand firm and don't lose your footing. Stop where you should. Don’t poke through the paper tiger. Also, guard against sudden rain and storms, morning and evening. As it turns out, the dream of worldly survival is the same. The drifting with the wind is like floating clouds. Nothing more than the same ups and downs.</p>

<h3 id="e212">"Waves Washing Sand" Premieres Today <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Lianhua's First Sound Film</p>
<p>Lianhua Company has been established for several years, and its newly produced films have been welcomed by audiences at home and abroad. However, its previous productions have all been silent films with dubbing. Recently, in order to adapt to the trend, it has focused on creating dialogue sound films. After a year of preparation, it has finally released its first production, "Waves Washing Sand." The film is directed by Wu Yonggang. Based on his past works "The Goddess" and "Little Angel," the excellence of this film's achievements is to be expected. The entire play depicts a criminal who accidentally kills a love rival, leading to being pursued by the police. Leaving his hometown and going far away, he unexpectedly meets the police officer on board. In the middle of the voyage, the ship encounters danger, and the two are adrift on a deserted island. However, due to conflicting interests, they cannot help each other. In the end, they are sacrificed to the power of nature and both perish. The tragedy and passion are extreme. The criminal and the detective are played by Jin Yan and Zhang Zhizhi respectively, both of whom are able to fit their roles appropriately. The film has achieved astonishing success in all aspects and premieres today at the Jincheng Grand Theatre.</p>

<p>Some time ago, this publication published an article about Wang Ying going to Japan, and explained that she may have no plays to do there. In fact, Chen Boer's departure will not lead to Wang Ying being assigned to do plays. Because the two of them are likely to clash when they are together. Therefore, even if Wang Ying goes to Japan, it will only be to play around. Now, I don't know if Wang Ying has realized that this trip will not be very pleasant for her. It is said that she has given up this idea. Moreover, recently there was a bizarre piece of news saying that she will be running a theater troupe. If this is true, I think it would be very suitable for her. However, running a theater troupe is not a simple matter, and whether she can pull it off is naturally a question.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Han Langen's Unexpected Harvest <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that Han Langen is a basic actor of Lianhua. However, Han Langen has roles in Lianhua's "Transformation Girl" and Xinhua's "Peach Blossom Spring Dream." However, it should be a rental, and the rental fee should be stipulated in the contract between the company and the company. But this time, Lianhua rented out Han Langen without asking for money. Therefore, his remuneration only increased. It is estimated that "Transformation Girl" will get 200 yuan, and "Peach Blossom Spring Dream" will get 800 yuan, which is an unexpected harvest for Han Langen.</p>

<p>The dynamic Han Langen swallowed six bottles of sleeping pills in "Sleepless Night."</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun has a tailor-made shirt in "Sleepless Night." According to director Wu Yonggang, it is the only one in the world.</p>
<p>The little sister Li Minghui, who can no longer be called "little sister," has joined the ranks of the Star Company.</p>
<p>Xu Manli and You Guanren both have roles in "Little Sisters."</p>
<p>Mei Xi is learning to sing from a foreign professor. In the past four or five months, his talent has helped him, and he can already sing very well.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengxin, who is very good at playing "Great Detective," drives a car beautifully.</p>

<p>Messrs. Tong Jianzao and others:</p>
<p>According to recent reports and conversations with friends, this film service agency is probably of a slippery nature. Since you already know that the agency has had similar fraudulent incidents in the Gongqing Building before, there is no need to try it out. Film companies officially recruit actors and never collect security deposits. This is my reply.</p>
