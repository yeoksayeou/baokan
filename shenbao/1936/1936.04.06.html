<h3>德國廢約後的外交戰術</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>從上月七日希特勒廢棄羅加請公的進兵萊茵河非武裝區域後到今天正好是整整一個月的時間了在過去一月間因德國廢的行動所引起的歐洲緊張局勢我們這里且不去論它而僅就這一月中德國在外交上所運用的戰術來作一個簡要的分析這種外交戰術的認識非但帮助我們容易瞭解歐洲最近局勢的發展而於我們「弱國無外交」的中國在以後外交政策的運用上更有重要的參考意義</p>
<p>德國在廢的行動後所採取的外交戰術的有三種第一是利用英法意等帝國主義國家間的內部矛盾其决是利用大英帝國主義與蘇聯社會主義國家間的衝突再决則爲製造民氣以爲强硬外交的後盾現在分別述之帝國主義國家問的利益本是無法調和的目前英法意等國間的利益均互相衝突英意二國因束菲戰事而起的衝突固十分嚴重卽法意羅馬協定的友善關係也因法國遵從國聯制裁意國的决議發生動搖而英法的利益又不完全一致尤其是在對德的關係上因英國對歐外交向採均勢政策戰後揚德抑法的傾向卽基於此羅加諾公約簽字國的利益旣不一致希特勒就得利用之來達到它的廢的目的了希氏一面拉攏被國聯制裁的墨索里尼使其不至履行羅加諾公的下的義務同時更投英國保守黨政府之所好使它做一個法德糾紛中的重要調解人而不嚴施羅加諾公的的規定希特勒拉攏英國的方法一面是下面所要說的反蘇聯口號一面則於廢的同時提出和平建議因爲英國是主張和平談判而不願見法國對德採取高壓政策的希氏於三月七日宣布廢的同時曾提出六點以爲國際和平談判的基礎艾登在三月九日下院演說中雖斥責德國片面廢的的行動但對希氏的新建議却表示願予以透澈的研究在倫敦會議中英國更力主邀請德國代表出席而三月十九日羅加諾四國協定中的第二部分全爲遷就希氏的建議而草成的以後艾登復屢决演說希望德國有所貢獻四月一日希特勒的貢獻發表了除堅持其所造成的旣成事實外復提出十九條和平建議範圍廣而不着邊際希特勒的眞正用意實在於利用英法利益的不同離間兩國的意見想把旣成的事實撇開而另商討國際和平問題這種利用帝國主義國家內部衝突的外交戰術現已獲得很大的成功因爲英國的態度已經注重於和平建議的討論了</p>
<p>其决帝國主義國家是根本同社會主義國家對立的保守黨統治下的英國允爲反蘇聯的重耍份子而希特勒則向以反蘇聯的先鋒自任這决廢的的藉口卽爲法蘇互助公的的批准非但違反羅加諾公的原來的反蘇聯精神而且還有使全歐赤化的危險這種說數正中保守黨政府的「下懷」英國對於法德糾紛採取調解的態度此亦爲一要因</p>
<p>再决製造民氣以爲外交的後盾向爲希特勒的一種重要外交戰術在一九三三年德國退出國聯與軍縮會議時希氏曾舉行公民投票來表示它的外交政策之爲全國大多數人民所擁護這决宣布廢的自然又不免要用這套舊戰術三月二十九日的褐色選舉結果希氏獲得絕大的勝利因此希氏就可對英法說它的外交政策已爲全國人民所擁護不能再有所讓步了這在四月一日的復文中就有明顯的指出</p>
<p>無論希特勒廢約行動的眞正意義如何其所運用的外交戰術就目前的歐洲局勢說顯已獲得很大的成功返顧我國國難日深疆土日促如何在外交上利用帝國主義國家問的內部矛盾去尋求眞正的友人以及如何激勵民氣以作外交的後盾實是我國當局與民衆所急須考慮解决的問題</p>

<p>序言內容、就德國備忘錄對於凡爾賽條的與羅卡諾公的所作解釋加以駁斥、（德國係謂萊茵河非武裝區域制度、與威爾遜故總統十四大綱相牴觸、其所依據之基礎、乃係協商國自行破壞其對於德國所提保證、至於羅卡諾公的、則係法軍佔領魯爾區域之後所訂立、對德保證、又經一度破壞、）</p>

<h3>教育播音專刋　保甲運動的重要和推進（下）</h3>
<p>內政部警政司司長李松風</p>
<p>（丙）力量要集中——現在行政上最大的毛病，就是「百廢俱舉」「一事無成」，道在地方組織方面允為顯著·醫如有了地方自治組織，又兼辦保甲，旣編組保衛團，又要編壯丁隊…等等，頭緒紛繁；地方上的人才和財力本屬有限，合在一起尙感不足，今分散到這許多方面去，又何怪一事無成呢！我在前面主張把保甲併入自治之內，最大的原因也就在此。因為自治必須完成組織訓練民衆的工作，保甲是組織民衆的最好方法，性質上旣然可以合併，我們為什麼不設法合併以集中我們的力量呢？</p>
<p>（丁）運用要便利——性質確定了，系統明白了，力量也集中了，如果是運用不靈，那仍舊不能算是合理的組織。至怎樣才可以運用便利呢？當然最重要的是組織簡單，權責分明。保甲採用首長制，不取合議制的，組織的層級又不多，不能不算很簡單，所以我們應該注意的，便是權責分明這一點，什麼事情是保長可以决定和應當辦理的，什麼事情是甲長可以决定和應當辦理的，以及限於什麼事情纔耍經過保甲會議决定，什麼事情纔要請示鄉鎭區縣……等等，都是應該具體規定的。</p>
<p>二，健全人員的選用——人員是組織的基礎，無論怎樣好的組織，如果沒有好的人員來充實，那個組織是死的。所以人員在任何組織中，都是特別重要的。允其保甲這種組織，非常簡單，不像複雜的組織有內部的控制與補助，人的條件更比較重要。我們認為關於保甲人員，有三點應當注意：</p>
<p>（甲）必須審重選擇——這是最重要的事情，因為如果選擇不善，不但保甲事務無法推行，而且保甲也許被人利用為作惡的工具，那是很危險的！選擇的標準，不僅注意能力，更應注意道德，此外志趣和年齡，也應該注意。保甲制度裏最大的特色，就是保甲人員的推定或變更，都要經過上級機關核准；而且縣長認為不能勝任時，還得令原推人改推；這是保甲精神與自治精神不一致的地方。我以為要保甲的人員健全，選擇必須加嚴，而且上級機關的干涉權有再加擴大的必要。因為非如此，不足達愼選人員的自的。</p>
<p>（乙）必須充分訓練——無論怎樣選擇人員，終恐未必全能適合保甲的要求，所以保甲人員必須再加以充分的訓練。現在巳有許多省份，在實行保甲長訓練了，這是很必要的。還有一點，我們現在知道公民訓練是很重要的一件事，但叫誰來負責訓練呢？那最好無過於保甲長；因為保甲不但是一種普遍的組織，而且也是利用政治方式施行敎育的最好方法，為了要擔負這種義務，保甲長的訓練，那更是萬分重要的了。</p>
<p>（丙）必須嚴格監督——因為保甲組織，內部的控制力非常薄弱，而保甲事務又那樣的繁冗，如果沒有上級機關的嚴密監餐，不但易流於因循，也恐怕發生流弊！所以縣政府和鄉鎭等，對於保甲人員必須加以嚴格的監督纔好。</p>
<p>三、積極事業的推進——我們要求保甲有合理的制度，健全的人員，其目的無非在便利保甲事樂的推進：所以在推行保甲運動上，對於保甲事業也應該特別注意。依照保甲法規所定，保甲的事業是很複雜的；但我們以為最重要的，要算下列幾點：</p>
<p>（甲）訓練壯丁——這是當前最重耍的工作，也是保甲的主要工作，是非積極推進不可的。訓練壯丁，不但可以為維持治安的助力，而且也可以增强保甲的力量。訓練壯丁的方式是很多的，但無論用什麼方法，必須要以保甲作它的基礎；離開了保甲組織訓練壯丁，那是對各個人施行訓練，利用保甲訓練壯丁，那是對有組織的人民施行訓練，兩者的差別，關係是很大的。</p>
<p>（乙）勞動服務——這也是當前最重要的問題，上面我們會經說過，勞動服務是生產建設的有力步驟，要想禦水防旱，征服自然以及便利交通，增加生產，都是非從勞動服務下手不可。而且勞動服務，是以社會福利為努力的對象，這在人民的觀念改造上，也妙很必要的。</p>
<p>（丙）合作事業——合作事業，可以說是常前復興農村最有力的辦法，無論信用合作，產業合作，消費合作……它的效果都是很大的。合作事業推行的最大障碍，一方面是銀行等恐怕放欵不確實，一方面是人民對於合作社的經營不信任。但是如果由保甲負責來推動，便很容易奏效。因為保甲旣是一個確實的組織，而且和每一戶均有密切關係，也容易明暸各戶情形，和取得各戶的信仰。所以我以為保甲應該積極負起責任來倡辦合作，它的效果也一定會很大的。</p>
<p>（丁）社會敎育——現在社會敎育的推行，其障碍一方面是缺少敎師及絆費，一方面也是很難使施敎時間不與農民工作衝突。但如果敎保甲長負資來推行社會敎育，這些困難便都可以免去。利用保甲長施敎，旣不患敎師無人，又可節省經費；而且保甲長也可以設法使其施敎時間不和本保甲的生活情形相背；施行上一定可以容易收效。現在廣西省用訓練後的鄉鎭長，兼任民團後備隊隊長，和國民基礎學校校長，就是一個很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>四、固定經費的籌措——最後，我們談到經費問題。無論什麼事，沒有經費是不成的；可以說經費實在是任何事業成功的基礎。保甲常然也不是例外。按照現在情形，各地保甲的經費是很少的，所以保甲事業很難有成績。而且因為經費沒有固定的來源，隨時攤派，也足以發生流弊病民！所以我們要想保甲辦得好，必須先寬籌經費，和確定經費的來源；最好的方法，我們以為應該藉經營公共事菜來籌措經費；道槐方法不但可靠而且不致擾民。固然，保甲的範園很小，不能經營什麼大的生產；但山保甲共同經營小的公產，是可能的。——江西省會經有「保田」，「保林」，「保池」，等運動，我以為這是很可採的方法。</p>
<p>以上關於保甲運動的推行，僅就組織，人員，事業，經費幾方面加以說明；因為時間關係，故不能詳述，這是應該向各位道歉的。（完）</p>

<p>自上次大戰以來、今日當爲歐洲局勢最緊張最嚴重之一天、晨間報紙、曾刊載希特勒將於今日上午接見英法意比與羅加諾條約有關四國之大使、德國會亦將於今午十二時開臨時會議、倫敦民衆、卽在紛紛討論、必將有重要發展、迨午報宣佈德軍二萬五千人開進萊茵非武裝區域、人心爲之大震、至晚、晚報將希特勒演說長文發表、且刋載德國交與各國大使之牒文、宣佈廢棄羅加諾條的、此種消息接連而來、使一般人士爲之驚愕不已、繼以冷靜著名之英人、亦不能不爲之惶惶然、今晚爲星期六、原係娛樂消遺之良時者、而因國際情勢如是緊張、亦已無心作紅酒美人之舉、舞塲咖啡館與街頭巷尾、盡爲時局討論空氣所包圍矣、</p>
<p>英外相艾登、今晨接見德英法三國大使及比利時代辦、與每人各別談話、均在半小時以上、至於巴黎之緊張、則較此更甚、原定午間召開內閣會議者、改由陸海空軍三部長與軍隊總司令加米林密商、外長佛蘭亭、則於會見英意俄波蘭捷克等大使外、復於今日下午六時、在外部舉行所謂戰爭委員會、首相與海陸空軍高級長官均參加、决定請求國聯對德實施財政經濟制裁、在必要時、並以軍事行動對付、蓋德國重佔萊茵區域、爲對於法國之直接打擊、以彼當事者之地位、實不免有此激昂態度也、</p>
<p>目下據萊茵區來電、德法兩國軍士已成面面相對之勢、最近期內、將有如何發展、當非一時所可預料、而此通信刋載之時、情勢或已較爲明瞭、記者原係爲參觀中國古物展覽會閉幕而來倫敦、適逢國際政局有如是劇變、亟赴各關係方面探詢、見其負責人員、均忙碌異常、於極匆促之中、分作談話、據彼等觀察德國之所以有重佔萊茵區域之舉者、下列各項、實爲其中主要動機、</p>
<p>一、法俄恊定批准之影響—法俄恊定簽字以來、德國方面卽表極度不滿、因該恊定目的在對德國、實極顯明、前年夏間、法俄外長巴爾都曾旅行東歐、擬結訂俄波捷德及波羅的海諸國之不侵犯修約、而在事猶未成之時、巴爾都卽與南斯拉夫國王被刺於馬賽、其後、法國再繼續談判「東方羅加諾條的」問題時、卽摒德波二國於圈外、迨去年五月二日、法外長拉伐爾與俄駐法大使波脫姆金議定法俄互助公的、實際上爲一軍事同盟、其目標爲對德、迨爲人所共知、當時德國之尚未作何實際表示者、因該的在法國會尚未批准、猶有轉圜餘地、迨上月法下院正式通過批准、上院亦將於本週內討論批准、則該的已成爲正式有效、此爲德國方面所不能默視者、因有今日重佔萊茵區域之大反饗、</p>
<p>二、意德外交活動之結果—意大利因在阿比西尼亞事伴上、英國固大施壓力、法國雖有羅馬協定亦未能作一臂之助、反而有所謂經濟制裁之實施、物質上之損失固不具論、在精神上亦覺異常難堪、而在此情勢之下、對於羅加諾條的義務遂有不願負祖之意、蓋依據一九二五年十月十六日簽訂之羅加諾條的、由英意兩國担保德與法比兩國被此不相侵犯、茍有一國侵犯他國、則英意兩國各以實力協助被侵犯者、而萊茵非武裝區域之規定、德國原係在凡爾賽條的被迫承認、至此、乃表示自願的接受、德法此之邊界、卽由英意兩國所担保、十年以來平安無事、最近意國爲報復英法起見有不願續負此項義務之意、同時復與德方有友誼合作之洽商、此則爲德國千載一時之機會、不能放過者也、（聞希特勒事前並曾耍求墨索里尼共同宣佈廢除羅加諾條的、雖未爲墨氏所答應、然意大利事前之影響、恐不能爲羅馬所吾認者也、）</p>
<p>三、德國復興必然的步驟—德人受凡爾賽條的之拘束、不許徵兵、不許建築砲壘、陸軍祗許有十萬人、戰艦不能超過一萬噸、海空實力不許擴充、於負祖巨額賠欵以外、復失去阿爾薩斯勞倫兩省及德比交界之歐賓麻美台（Eupen　Malmedy）暨一切殖民地、萊因河之左右兩岸三十英里則作非武裝區域、永遠不得駐兵、此種苛刻條件、在一九一九年七月廿八日、德國雖於被迫下簽字、然以德國民族之過去光榮、受此恥辱、心中不甘、實無時或巳、當時以戰後經濟狀况惡劣、不能不有暫時之忍耐、故在期德萊史曼外長時代、全取與法國合作主義、於簽訂羅加諾條的之後、復加入國際聯盟、與其仇敵重握手於日內瓦、其後道威斯楊格兩計劃成立、德國賠欵數目不獨减少、日亦確定年限、而因世界經濟恐慌發生、一九三一年、胡佛一紙牒文及一九三二年之洛桑協定、賠欵於是停付、至此、凡爾賽之和的一頁業已失效、德國經濟復興乃漸有希望、然德人復興之心、不僅止於經濟而已、軍事國防亦不能長此受制人、此步工作則由希特勒爲之完成、</p>
<p>國社黨執政以後、卽作「軍備平等」之要求、但爲國聯及軍縮會議所拒絕（一九三二年二月）、於是一九三三年十月、在希特勒爲首相之十日後、正式宣佈退出國聯及軍縮會議、决年正月、德又與波蘭訂立十年互不侵犯條的、去年三月十六日、乃正式宣佈恢復軍備、實施徵兵制度、當時記者適在德國旅行、親在柏林及各處目覩德人對於政府舉動之熱在擁護、深知此確爲德人復興之普遍要求、其後、戈林將軍所領導之空軍、在柏林作大規模之飛行、去年六月、英德海軍協定成立、德人又將恢復其已被廢除之海軍實力、至此、德人在一九一八年戰敗羞辱所遺留者、乃爲非武裝之萊茵區域、昨日二萬五千軍士之開入萊茵、助以坦克砲車機關槍及飛機兩百架、聲勢雄威已極、而當地德人、因受制於他國者已久、鬱抑之氣、至今乃得爲之一吐、德國全體民衆、亦必覺十八年來之含恥、一旦雪除、胸懷快慰何似、歐洲局勢、雖因之大爲嚴重、而在德人視之、則此舉係德國復興中必然之行動、正如希特勒今日正午十二時在國會演說所謂「使一誠實與勇敢之民族永居於奴隸地位乃爲不可能之事也、」（三月八日性初自倫敦發）</p>
<h3>厦門米價問題</h3>
<p>近兩週間米價飛漲　米商乘機囤積居奇</p>
<p>廈門通信、廈漳泉米價、最近旬日間起落極鉅、平民生活、影響至大、查其原因、閩南一帶、僅漳屬產米、然絕不敷供給、故廈門及泉州各屬、向來均仰給南洋越南暹羅仰光洋米、昔日洋米進口無稅、源源而至、價格頗廉、因轉運至便、調劑亦易、迨民國二十二年秋間、以長江一帶豐收、而洋米傾銷、終不免有穀賤傷農之象、政府爲保護本國農村計、乃有征收洋米進口稅之舉、廈門一口、以閩南非產米區、乃特別變通、洋米僅征半稅、民國二十四年、仍改征全稅、當二十二年未征稅時、洋米每百斤（廈門市秤）僅五元餘、二十三年、卽漲至六元餘、征全稅後、更漲至七元餘、同時廈門米價、亦自五元餘漲至七元或七元一二角、洋米每擔徵稅國幣二元四角、故征稅之後、殊難與國米競爭、其進口遂無形逐漸減少、據調查越南暹羅仰光洋米、二十二年廈門進口達七十二萬包、（每包百六十斤）二十三年征半稅、進口四十四萬包、二十四年征全稅、進口减至十九萬包、先是越暹印當局、爲遷就對華輸出計、自將米價抑低、使適合到廈售價、本年歐洲風雲一緊、各國爭向南洋購米屯積、越暹及仰光米價、乃高漲至每百斤售洋六元四角、連同進口稅及附稅二元六角、常達九元之數矣、於是洋米乃突然停止進口、去年十二月起、省政府爲籌劃保安團費、復對漳米出口征收每包一元之米捐、同時長江各省之米、已不若前年之豐收、上海米價自然增高、因而自難運廈調劑、而閩南產米、又不足自給、綜此數端、最近兩週問、米價乃山」元一二角（前一週）飛漲至八元六角、以公斤計、每百公斤由十二元漲至十五元、漳屬富農地主·及廈門金融界投機者、復爭囤米居奇、以致廈門日需米七百包、而屯米有兩萬餘包、仍不稍跌、本週中、因溫州福州廣州各處、聞廈門米漲、競運米來售、頂盤開價已自八元六角、步跌至七元七角、而成交反少、現米商正因米價高漲、運動洋米减征半稅。及撤銷漳屬米捐、故頂盤開價雖跌、二盤批發、三盤門市、仍不稍跌、四月一日、門市國米尚售八元八角、越南洋米九元二角、此外尚有一問題、卽洋米進口稅率之不一致、財政部規定稅率爲法幣二元四角、廈門進口連附稅二元六角、但廣東洋米進口特稅率爲亳洋一元四角二分八厘、合法幣僅一元一角、最近又納米商請求、减去四分之一、是祇及法幣七角七分半譜、相差至鉅、故粵米商運洋米進口、國米出口無稅、乃以粵產紅米或洋米冒充國米運廈、成本僅七元二三角、到廈售七元六七角、已獲利不少、是洋米在廈進口、須虧本一元三角、漳米到廈則虧三角、現漳農競運米石到廈求售、而米商一方不願賤價賣出、一方不願高價買入、故目前廈市存米旣多、來源復不絕於途、門市出售又高價不跌、影響民生、至深且鉅也（四月二日）</p>
<h3>粵省救濟米荒</h3>

<p>諸位、我們在上海的奥僑、今天能夠在此地歡迎童德乾先生、實在非常高興、他今天還給我們這個機會、聽到他的很有趣味、而使我們獲得很多益處的演講、增加我們的智識、放大我們的眼光、尤其使我們不能不十分感謝他、兄弟認得童先生、尚在他未到奥國以前、屈指算來、已經有八年多光景、因為謒他有多年的關係、所以今年敢把這一位外交家的履歷、講一遍給大家介紹一下、童先生生長於一個世代在我國當過外交官的家庭中間、所以他在政治上與外交上所得到的知識和經騐、幾乎沒有別的外交官能夠比得上他、他在歐洲過的日子極多、在種種政治問題中間、看到了弱小民族問題、對於中國在歐洲及國際聯盟會政治上的重要關係、因此他對於這個問題、很早就加以硏究、我只要把歐洲戰後民族地圖展開一看、就可馬上知道此弱小民族問題、在國際政治上關係的重要、歐洲在政治上及民族上、都分裂得很、比之遠東、簡直像地獄與天堂一樣、因為遠東從來未曾有如歐洲那樣不統一的情形、歐戰之結果、不但沒有改良此種情形、反而叫他更壞了、根據和平條約要新定各國國界的時候、國際聯盟會必先委派專家委員會實地調査、在這種委員會中、往往就選擇遠東的外交家、做劃定國家委員會的主席、這些遠東代表、當然不能不熟悉所有和這個問題有關係的地理·經濟·政治·及民族問題、這種問題解决是否妥善、對於中國有很大的影響、蓋以此可以得到或失去人家的同情、所以担任的人、必須熟識這種問題、並且是一個良好而有固定目的政治家、外交官、在外國服務所需要的知識與經騐、童先生都有、他能在這樣非常短的時候、得到全奧國上下人士的同情和友誼、其原因就在於此、童先生因為明白奧國的困難、知道奧國的需要、熟悉奧國偉大的使命、所以他據從前駐華奧國公使羅士恒博士所創中奧兩國互惠的精神、盡力來帮助奧國、不啻在本國或在外國外交界中、他總是想法使人完全明白奧國問題和他的需要、而且呌他們注意於奧國在國際上的使命、童先生曾經說「奧國就是歐洲的心、要是這心不跳的話、歐洲在世界上的精神、與倫理上的使命、從此就完了、要是這個心生病或受傷、　麽全歐洲就要受莫大的影響、」這句話他說得很對、由此我們就可以明白、童先生怎麽能夠在維也納遞交國書、不久以後、就大得奧國的人心、他是奧國三個偉大的國務總理的親密的朋友、第一個就是當時稱為全歐政治家在世界上享有盛名的國務總理柴博士（Seipel）、看他當作私人朋友一樣、第二個就量在歐洲有治安保護者之稱號、並且是全世界出名的警政專家、奧國國務總理壽伯博士（Scbober）很寳貴童先生外交上的經騐、第三個是奧國人民永久要紀念的為國犧牲的奧國國務總理　烈夫士博士（Dolfuss）、他當時因為童先生中文很好、並且對於中國文化很有硏究、所以常常同童先生討論中國文化、中國思想、中國美術、和其他種種問題、這三個奧國偉人、可惜都已先後去世、童先生在奧國、代表中國、能叫奧國人對中國人有很多的感想、能叫雙方澈底瞭解、十分融洽、的確很是難得、有一回奧國國務總理、因為奧國很久在中國沒有正式外交代表、對童先生表示很抱歉的意思、童先生就說一句很有趣味而且很對的話回答他、「先生、何不許我繼續同時在中國、也代表奧國與奧國的文化、」之一句話、當時曾使一般人覺得很感嘆、並且非常有意思、童先生這七年在奧國的時候、正當奧國現代史上三個偉大的國務總理當權的時候、這七年的功夫、就把童先生自己覺得完全變成奧國人了、奧國也就變成他的第二祖國了、這個事實、在維也納的外國人、也不以為奇怪、因為奧國人的心理、與別的歐洲人比較起來、實在有幾個很特別的優點、這些優點、也就是奧國人與中國人相同的地方、中國人在奧國覺得很舒服、奧國人在中國也覺得很舒服、原因就是在此、奧國人的和氣·活潑·自在·安分·人所共知、這就是舊文化的結果、奧國人在最大的困難之下、還能自樂其生、並且能夠進一步利用他的種種困難、作為美術思想的好材料、用以作詩·作樂·作畫譜·或作雕刻、幾百年以前、在維也納有一個音樂家、一般人都稱他為「活潑的奧古寺丁」、因為他雖然很窮苦、總是非常活潑、這個人可以說是奧國人的代表、奧國人因為有這種很特別能安分目在的精神、所以歐戰以後、維也納雖然在極嚴重的經濟困難之下、仍舊能夠維持他很高的文化程度、繼續保持他的名譽、為文化之中心、為音樂美術及科學之首都、奧國這個很舊的文化與他的愛美之精神、就是他與中國相同的地方、兩千年以前、羅馬人創造維也納、從那個時候起一直到現在、奧國人的愛美精神、繼續不斷的跟着理想發展、而把物質生活、完全忘却、人生所有的問題、都要用精力去解决他、不要用武力去解决他、這個不是中國思想與奧國思想相同的地方嗎、可惜這種安分的精神、在現代已不甚相宜、以致中國與奧國的人民、都不能安樂、奧國人有了這種特別心理、他們的政治與政策、當然也不能夠同別人一樣、這個不但現在小奧國是這樣、歐戰以前的大奧國也未嘗不是這樣、兄弟要舉幾個例證明他、在西曆一八九八年、就是光緖二十四年、中國皇帝銳意變法、西太后重新垂簾聽政、把皇帝在瀛臺監禁起來、廢新法、殺黨人、那個時候在北京的外國各公使、都不願意中國人改新、所以他們都幫助西太后、他們當時在北京開會討論這個問題的時候、只有一個外國公使拍案大怒、反對他們去見西太后、他說他知道皇帝沒有什麽病、他新定的法律、是非常之好的、西太后懂些什麽、只想弄權而已、要是外國各公使、實在是中國人朋友的話、就應當竭力的去幫助皇帝、照他的意思、他們應該全體看中國皇帝、當面問他狀然、可是外國各公使都沒有眼光、不聽他的話、逕去見西太后、這樣一來、他們就害了中國了、那一個反對他們的公使、到底沒有去見西太后、這個人是誰呢、就是奧國子爵羅士恒博士、後來他回國以後、有人責備他當時在北京沒有同別的外國公使合作、他就去見奧國皇帝說明一切、竭力主張奧國决不可同別國一樣、施行帝國主義的政策、只能幫助中國、自己變成一個强而有力的國家、來保護並發達他們五千年的文化、奧國皇帝非常贊成他的意思、就叫他重新到遠東去代表奧國、後來又有一回、滿淸政府向奧國兵器厰定購很多的軍器、這一位奧國子爵、因為是奧國公使的關係、中國政府當然也要同他接洽、羅公使就馬上表示他大不贊成的意思、他說如果一定要買兵器、也何必認定向奧國買呢、他這一句話、當然使那時候一般人很覺奇怪、後來大批兵器運到中國的時候、舉行一種接受禮節、有一個很大的讌會、席間有一個旗、代表中國政府說了一些好聽的話以後、羅公使就回答他幾句話、他的意思、本來不要在奧國買兵器、因為奧國的長處不在武裝、只是在文明方面、他旣不能攔阻他們買、現在軍器又已到了中國、所以他現在只有一個希望、誻希望滿淸政府、將來不要用這些從奧國買來的兵器去殺中國人、那個時候、這一位奧國人的話一般人聽起來都很奇怪、可是不久就知道他那個時候的希望、是很有道理的、原來中國革命的時候、滿淸政府就用那些兵器殺了不少中國人、羅公使政策里邊的根本原則、就是要使中國內部好好兒改組、變做一個强國、這樣他們所需要的兵器、非但不需別人供給、完全可以自己製造、豈不甚善、可惜羅公使的理想沒有實現、中國從那個時候一直到現在、買來多少外國兵器、把多少錢送給外國、結果他自己所得到的好處、多麽渺小、到了一九二一年、有一個美國人Gilber　　Reid在他所寫的「中國自由鬥爭」一本書上、第九千九百、批評這位奧國羅公使說、「這一位外交家、是很大的中文學者、同時為中國自由權利之先鋒戰士、他在北京服務的時間、比反對他的七個外國公使服務時間加起來的總數、還長得多了」、（這七個公使就是歐戰時候强迫中國政府、向德國奧國開戰、羅公使一個人反對、但是寡不敵衆）、現在羅公使在維也納為中國文化·倫理·及其哲學的先驅戰士、他頂佩服的是孔子的永遠不朽的眞理、每星期兩次、有極少數發奮為學的人、在維也納故宮博物院裏面的中國硏究機關、聚集起來、跟羅公使學中文、我也是他的一個學生、在他所創造的中國硏究機關裏、有兩萬多本中國書、都是中國文學上頂好的硏究材料、經史子集都全、都是頂好的板本、這些書籍、是羅公使在中國服務二十七年中間、自己陸續搜集到的、實在是奧國一個有名的文化勝地、所以奧國政府也百般幫助他組織這個中奧精神中心、羅公使在他這種文化工作上、常常也受到童先生莫大的幫助、記得有一次以某種情形關係、維也納這個中國文化中心、忽然發生很大的危險、那個時候要不是童先生同奧國政府雙方竭力幫助、我們現在的奧國、恐怕不會有這麽一個中國文化的中心了、童先生是羅公使一個親密的朋友、他們兩個人很奇怪、一個是中國化的奧國人、一個是奧國化的中國人、他們兩個都不是只講空話的人、他們是實行家、他們的意思就是世界和平、在乎各民族互相澈底明瞭、我們奧國人雖然不能以大砲同毒氣供給中國、但是我們有音樂與詩人、美術與科學、可以把中國的超人先師孔子·老子·荘子·孟子·以及其他諸子的哲學換得來、可以把唐朝的李白、杜甫·及無數詩家抽象的作品換得來、為其代價、我們很相信童先生在奧國覺得很舒服、這個我們很能夠明白他、我們方面、他也相信我們在他的這麽大的這麽美的祖國、就是在文化最古的中國、在注重精神上美麗的中國、在敎育與藝術並重的中國、在神聖烹飪朮最發達的中國、也覺得非常的舒服、</p>

<h3>歐亞公司　各航綫力謀改進　現在注重西南與京滬之交通　將來努力國際間航郵之實現</h3>
<p>歐亞航空公司現有航綫四條、總里程為四千五百十公里、連絡西北各省、以巨型機飛航各綫、當日到達、故客旅稱便、最近展航至昆明、以改進西南各省與京滬之交通、於國內經濟文化之溝通、允為重耍、茲將該公司現在及上年度之航務情形、探誌如後、</p>
<p>國內航綫大概情形</p>
<p>各航綫之情形、　滬新綫、自二十二年七月新省政變、該綫蘭州以西暫吿停航、在去年一年中雖經不斷之交涉、但短期內仍無復航之望、二十三年開辦之平粵及蘭包兩航綫、蘭包綫自十一月起全綫通航、迄今按班飛行、平粵綫則自去年七月起僅飛行北平至鄭州一段、至七月間、奉部令代辦、由西安經漢中至成都之陝蓉綫、經一月餘之籌備、即正式通航、但因漢中無適當機塲、故暫不設站、至十二月間、又奉令添闢京滇航綫、惟以該綫所經貴陽等地、氣候惡劣、而航綫又長、維持經費至鉅、故呈准交部、改為陝滇綫、巳於本月一日開航、　各綫航班、在二十三年中除平粵綫外、其他各綫均僅每週往返一次、至去年春因業務之進展、即將各航綫飛行班期逐漸增加、自九月起、已一律增至每週往返各二次、</p>
<p>技術方面日見改進</p>
<p>至技術上之改進、巳得良佳之成績、　在開辦之始、各站及飛機內所裝電臺、除業務上應用之短波發報機外、並兼採用長波式、意在逐漸為定向及盲目飛行之設備、以保航行之安全、自二十三年起、除航站電臺外、遇兩站間有地形氣候惡劣之區、又於其間適當地點加設中間電臺、隨時與飛機以電信聯絡、至去年底除機內之電臺外、計已設有航站及中間電臺二十三處、　各陸上電臺、以在飛機飛行時與飛機聯絡隨時報吿當地天氣偵察飛機之踪跡、及以必要之情形、供給飛機為主要任務、此外自上年六月起及在去年全年內、每日另發當地氣候報吿兩决、以供國內氣象界及一般航空之需、此項氣候報吿、由南京站南短波四七米之波長、於每日八時三刻及十四時三刻時廣播之、　為謀吏進二步之安全、去年　間即開始盲目飛行之試騐、初期僅以通知定向（出地上電臺測知飛機之方向通知飛機）試行於長沙廣州之間、經三個月之努力、現已改用覓地定向、（由飛機自行測知其目的地）普遍實施於各航綫、　上海成都間之航程、計二千公里、中間再經優數站、在冬季欲使於一日間到達、必須有部份之夜間航行、故自九日間陜蓉綫開航時起、即於龍華港為必要之夜航設備、黑暗之中、即遇惡劣氣候、因有定向之指示、可策充分安全、至龍華港於三月來之計班、所有界燈障碍燈潑光燈、均已逐漸設施完備、</p>
<p>將來計畫國際航郵</p>
<p>至將來之計劃、　平粵綫現僅飛行北平鄭州一段、其鄭州經漢口長沙以達廣州一段、亦擬設法復航、現芷在籌劃中、　實現國際航郵辦法、如滬新可通至俄邊、則由上海至德國柏林之航程、祗需五日半、此在二十二年九月兩架JU52號機由柏林飛滬　已有三决之事實證明、又如另由上海取道緬甸·印度·而往柏林、則祗須七日或八日即可到達、此又有二十三年九月及去年八月九月歷次GU52號大型機來滬之事實、可資證明、為期有副社會中外人之望、仍望繼續努力謀滬新全綫之復航、以促歐亞間五日到達國際郵運之實現、倘終無辦法、亦擬以滬滇為基礎、另謀由昆明出緬印以達歐陸航綫之可能、是尙賴於政府當局之提携、與乎社會人士之恊助、有以促成之、</p>

<p>十九名朱聲遠</p>
<p>謝行導初露頭角</p>
<p>昨日風和日麗、氣候宜人、參加競走者六十五人、無不精神百倍、九時正在市府前集合點卯、由府西內路向西出發、敎局引導車在前、羣雄爭逐、一時難見先後、五百米後謝行導突出重圍、領導前茅、周如泉緊緊跟隨、不離左右、邱德昌張顯崙等、亦絡續前進、至淞滬路時、决序依然未變、</p>
<p>周如泉後來居上</p>
<p>惟周如泉雄心勃勃、不再落後、至政通路時脚底加油、追出謝行導、謝並一度爲邱德昌爭前、退居第三位、至海通路口始又衝出、一圈完畢、周超謝僅數米、謝後二百米爲邱德昌、邱後三百米爲張顯崙、又三百米爲徐藹臣郭信根、至徐國福·施文奎·周銀華·唐文儀·朱世英·吳潤昌等又落後甚遠、</p>
<p>謝行導再逞威風</p>
<p>二圈開始、至國和路時謝行導突如怒馬在奔、追出周如泉躍居前導、餘子仍照原序未變、周如泉雖幾經奮發、數奪實座、奈謝行導不肯放鬆、未償宿願、是後大勢巳定、第二圈中頗少變化、維時十時左右、謝行導先達終點、其成績爲五十一分二十八秒五分之二、周如泉落後的八十米、叉後四百米始見邱德昌抵達終點、其决爲張顯崙·郭信華·徐國福·唐文儀等、至十時四十分許始全部報到、老人葛精康本屆仍然參加、其宅次爲五十三名、實已難能可貴</p>
<p>周如泉仍得冠軍</p>
<p>稍待片刻、裁判員報告名决、因根據檢察報名、謝行導邱德昌、因姿勢關係、未能錄取、周如泉仍得冠軍、惟謝邱兩將精神甚佳、潘局長爲鼓勵起見、特另給獎品、以償其失常局之提倡體育鼓勵健兒、於此足見一斑、</p>
<p>競賽畢當塲給獎</p>

<h3>跑人記</h3>
<p>巧極了，市敎育局的一萬公尺競走，和西人體育會的公開越野賽跑，同在昨天的上午，在市中心區和江灣舉行。我很興奮地决心要起個早，除了採訪新聞之外，惟一的目的，是想吸吸早晨野外的空氣；我想提倡早晨競技的意義，未始不是要抓住這剎那的寶貴底光陰！更不料又正當是淸明節啊——這是我後來纔知道的。</p>
<p>「這市中心區我和它別了多久啦！」當我車過復旦大學，向目的地在晨光和煦中疾馳的時候，這偉大的堡砦—市體育塲立刻又出現在我的視綫中，我不禁喊出這麼一聲。去年全國運動會着實轟轟烈烈地熱鬧一番；可是從此以後，我還是到今天纔第一决和它相會。這麼廣泛的市中心區，建造這麼一座誇耀全國的市體育場，幾乎給人們忘掉了。</p>
<p>早晨的陽光特別是灧麗嬌柔。今年的春天，一向被冬季多餘的寒冷威脅着，老是被人們怨咒而沒有發生過好感；可是今天這煦麗的春光，闌珊地，嫵媚地，在我心的深處，像一杯綠酒似的濃了。</p>
<p>八點三刻到市政府。寬闊平坦的馬路上，停着不少的汽車和許多競走的健兒和羣衆等等。在市政府的會客室裹找到了許多競走的職員，會見了許久沒有會晤的朋友。他們之間的一位，立刻用了强迫手段，把一條什麼「計時員」的徽章，硬替我佩上衣襟，這可使我不自然起來了。好，管它，反正這事情不會麻煩我，不服從也只好服從了。</p>
<p>九點二十分在市府右邊的叫百公尺距離的起點，發令的槍，迫着競走者們和我手裏的碼錶，同時發動了。職員和羣衆們都又本能地踱回市府前，等着；等着，有的找束西吃，有的在揣測這一次的勝利者。的二十分鐘之後，在市府左面遠遠的馬路上，一陣像排着隊伍的脚踏車，夾雜着各種顔色的背心短褲的競走者，很威風地向市府而來。這不過是全程之一半，還要走這麼一大圈。當第一人到達府前的時候，我的錶上已走了二十四分三十七秒，我巳經可以佔計到全程應費多少時問了。</p>
<p>這一隊競技者的羣裹，有一位五十歲左右的老者，叫葛精康的，人字式的鬍鬚已那麼長長的分排在他的嘴唇上邊，頭頂也有些禿了。說句俏皮話，有不少的競技者可以當他的兒子。他的身體很瘦，可是勁道確實不差，這是在比賽完了我纔得到證實的。跑在最前的姿勢，總是挺括美麗；跑在最後的姿勢，有像用他的兩手向前面抓東西，老是抓不着似的；有像在河邊拉締，身體的上部伸在前面，手和脚的擺動和身體失去平衡，所以發揮不出原力。</p>
<p>第二個圈子兜回來，畢竟是謝行導第一，這是大家早就得到的正確的預斷。（不料結果反被取消資格，眞是奇怪。）另外一個第一是當我將要離開市府的時候發現在汽車後面的王樹舫。</p>
<p>比賽完畢後，還有給獎和拍照；可是時間不容許我再等，急忙趕回江灣路虹口游泳池邊</p>
<p>天的四週邊際，白茫茫地朦上一層薄霧，太陽已漸漸地收歛起可愛的光芒，不時下着稀疏的毛雨，淸明時節的「灧陽天」，忽又變了「雨紛紛」了。</p>
<p>虹口公園的側門前，也有許多的羣衆，更有許多的巡捕和東西洋的「三道頭」等候在馬路中間和兩旁，將有什麼重大緊急的事態快要發現似的。這時已經十點三刻，照我的估計，這中西公開的越野賽跑，健兒們應該在石子路和田野的阡陌上掙扎着，不久要到終點了。那知大出我意料之外。等到十一點鐘，大批的競技者剛從虹口公園的側鬥裏換好衣服鉋出來，原來還沒有開始。皮斯萊命令着賽員們排列在馬路間，外國三道頭急忙地阻止兩端的車輛的行駛。點完了名，皮斯萊喊出一暨Go　幾百條腿便「疾塵而去」了。</p>
<p>我再叫車夫立刻開到江灣路和翔殷路的接頭處等候，那裹是一段最要緊的轉折。到十一點二十分的時候，最先的幾人，從田野的小路上出現到翔股路上，朝江灣路跑了不多的路，就折入東體育會路。眞糟極了，賽員都沒有號碼，這一紙名單不能爲我發生功效，老實說，我祗認識王正林和張良，他們巳最前的跑去了。算了吧，跑到終點總有辦法。於是立刻又回到終點。</p>
<p>畢竟還是王正林跑在最前，吳文林第二，凌學文第三，馬日吉第四，張良反得第五。第一的時間二十九分三十四秒四，超過了以前三十分零八秒的最高紀錄。團體錦標也是屬於王正林等的一冰隊。（魄）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （朱人一）</p>
<p>「努力保持你的靈魂聖潔，勿使你的天眞失掉，這就是眞理」。這兩句話十分淺濕簡明。可是請你仔細想想，這就是世界上最難得的「眞理之所在」啊！</p>
<p>「思想好像手，也得磨練的」。這是高爾基的話。「精神愈用則愈出」。這是曾國藩的話。偉人的時代和境地雖則不同，見解却是差不多呢</p>
<p>「眞實的信仰，必須有眞實的行為」。一種主義，必須在思想信仰之外，再加上力量，方有精神。信仰與懷疑的分別，也就是實行和徘徊之差罷了。</p>
<p>「不把恐怖放到自己的靈魂裏去，並且準備為自己爭鬥」。這就是尋求出路唯一的法門。</p>
<p>「勞動，在從前是一種恥辱，一種重累；但現在已變成光榮的新事業了」。勞動者最多的國家，將是世界上最强的國家。</p>
<p>我們作事應該「把今天踏在脚下，而目光集中將來」。</p>
<p>以上是筆者在讀書時札記出來的，都是偉人的至理名言。介紹給本欄讀者，可為座右銘。</p>
<h3>滄浪亭畔看梅花</h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>「滄浪亭圖書館看梅花去」！在這四月一日至七日的舉行梅展時期，到處都聽得這一句的呼聲。很冷靜的一三元坊地方，變做游人如織。游人的分五類：愛園藝的去看園梅，愛盆景的去看盆梅，愛名畫的去看畫梅，愛書籍的去看梅花圖籍，愛兒童作品的去看兒童梅展。第一天開幕，竟日下雨，胃雨赴會的已有數百人。决日天晴，參觀的激增，竟在千人以上。小子梅雪，以前曾在春秋欄內，做過二三十篇文字。後來，為着大學裏的功課繁重，久沒有餘閒，弄這筆墨了。此番，春假回去，恰値可園梅展，小子喚做梅雪，倘不參加梅展，豈不辜負了自己的名號？所以大好的春假，小子只消磨在省立蘇州圖書館內。參加以後，還要參加，只為梅花是小子的敝本家，無論園梅？盆梅，畫梅，譜梅，五百年前是一家，都可以引起小子很深摯的感情，理該替可園梅展宣傳一下子了。</p>
<p>園梅部分，臨池的一株鐵骨紅，可稱梅花之王。盆梅古畫，近人畫，現代畫，兒童畫，四種。古畫中，如陳眉公冊頁，金冬心立軸，以及八大山人，羅兩峰，湯雨生諸家，美不勝收。允被人注目的，是唐六如的墨梅，加着高江村的題詠，確為近時藝林希見的珍寳。近人品作，有吳窗齋，顧鶴逸，金心蘭，倪墨耕諸家。現代作品，有葉譽虎，張大千，吳湖帆諸家。梅蘭芳所畫折枝花，也很受入家的注目禮。兒童梅展，都是眞價實貨的小朋友實畫手筆。其他，關係梅花的圖譜，都陳列在玻璃檯中，不便翻閱，只好看看標題，實行其望梅止渴罷了。</p>
<h3>春之曲</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>春種一粒粟，秋收萬顆子，這雖是生物學上的定律之一極，但是從這二句中，挺可以瞧得秋季裏的種種悲愁，是早已在春李裏，播下了一粒種子了。</p>
<p>在春天，據說每一個人的血液，都是加速着奔騰着的，所以到了春天，任誰都會骨得疲憊；這是「春困」。人既覺得疲憊；無論如何，都覺得打不起精神來，於是乎緊跟着是「春睡」。至人才能無夢，常人總不免於做夢，於是旣入睡鄕，便不能不作春夢」。這是春之三部曲。但不知春夢婆娑，何時得醒。而且只怕醒來時，雖未花謝鳥啼，也早巳濃陰匝地，景物全非了。</p>
<p>一般的說來，春，似乎是最値得欣賞和留戀，因為在明媚的春光中，攬轡郊遊，是旣暖和，復悅目。但是，同時，我覺得最是慘然的，也是這個春，因為在春季中，不下雨則已，一旦下了雨，準會連連綿綿的下一個沒休沒歇。在夜半夢回時，聽着檐流滴搭，把愁緒悲情，連連綿綿的勾上心頭，準會鬧得半夜不合眼。所謂春宵一刻値千金，殊可為此情此景詠。</p>
<p>春眠不覺喨，處處聞啼鳥，夜來風雨聲，花落知多少。這首古唐詩，似乎也不過是詠着閩思之深而已。可是這些年來，我每吟咏一次，總是增加着一層對於國家身世的傷感，轉覺着還是花開堪折直須折，及時行樂，來得有趣。</p>
<p>不過春雖有可以詛咒的所在，但是從大體的說來，究竟還不失為一個値得頌贊的節候，因為在春天，任譙總還都有着些兒生氣。詩人的一肚子牢騷，總也還能及時而寄之於吟詠。酒人們把皮大褂，去換棉大褂，再把棉大褂，去換夾大褂，總還能有些兒餘資，可買一醉。至於農人們，自然要不肯輕輕地把春放過，因為這正是一個把希望播種下去的最適宜的時候呀。</p>
<h3>賀天健畫展</h3>
<p>— 皖南江漪</p>
<p>今之畫家好以名號自尊，曰師，曰伯，曰聖，而吾友賀子天健獨非之，曰自古未聞有以聖伯師自稱者，藝事宜從實際用功夫，初不計及名與利也。今之畫家好以創作自矜，而賀子曰創作，須從古法中生出已法，乃為創作，不知古法而自創一法，無有不成野狐禪者，甚且雖窮思極想，仍不及古人萬一。此猶其上焉者，其决逾以創作號召，而其畫逾不創作，每以臨寫古人印本攫為己有以欺世者。然則賀子之畫如何。余嘗見其此决畫展之畫焉，大多皆以江浙諸處之名勝為畫材，如雁蕩仙霞嶺五洩太湖及蜀之峨嵋山金頂等，無不攝取其情境而表現之，至共方法則萃五代兩宋之長以自成一法，蓋眞創作也。余不好浮誇，觀其畫展，卽知余言之不謬，賀子不好名，而名自至，不獨國內卽海外扶桑台灣暹羅，亦震其名而匯金求其畫，賀子不好利，而一畫千金亦有人斥之以珍其畫。賀子鬻畫為生者，其終年熙熙，樂如恒也，本月三日賀子畫展在本市寗波同鄉會舉行，余因揭一文以為天下吿，因賀子不好誇，爰從平實措辭。</p>
<h3>書從昭關到浣沙溪後</h3>
<p>— 狄秀之</p>
<p>月之二十三日，本欄載有詹若耶君大作從昭關到浣沙溪一篇，所述殊多不實。溧陽（並非「歷陽」，亦不呌和縣，惟距浣沙溪之七里許有一舊縣村，大的若耶君因此誤會吧。）為作者之故鄉，且浣沙溪距作者之家，不到二里；爰將該溪之情形，沘筆記之，以吿讀者。</p>
<p>浣沙祠，在溧陽南渡鎭北關外的二里許之大河邊。祠之附近，尙立有浣沙女之衣衾墓。該大河古名瀨江，卽今之浣沙溪。祠前有大橋一座，右首有一瀨江菴，惟己傾圯不堪，僅可為農人休憇之所。浣沙祠則以有祠田十餘畝，作為春秋祭饗及修葺祠宇之資，所以尙稱完整。查浣沙女姓史，現在浣沙祠之管理權，完全操之於史姓之後裔。該祠地處偏僻，以前遠方人士知者甚鮮。自京杭國道通車以來，該處適為經過之要道，聞名而往參觀者亦漸多。中央近有保存古蹟之明令，這種歷史上極有價値之古祠古墓，似有歸地方政府直接管理並修葺之必要。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲恨千秋</p>
<p>一道長廓上，列着一座紅卍字架格，和大小花架子，這裏隨了各種大小盆景配着那肥或瘦的菊花，很是幽雅得宜，我嘴裏連連的說：很好！很好！蘭厂將頭四週觀望笑着說：我畢生的心力，都在這裹了。他一面說着，一面引着我進了旁首一間客廳。這裏已是有五六位賓客，老老少少，坐在幾張矮的軟椅和錦墩止。蘭厂搶着和我介紹有一位小說家，兩位詩人，兩位畫家，還有一位年老的詞人，這一見之下，讓我很是高興。允其是那位小說家，方大白是我十幾年來，早巳佩服的。所以在大家握手言歡之下，非常痛快。蘭厂所請的賓客，似乎還不限於這個屋子裏的幾位，說着話，他又到別一間屋子去招待了。那位小說家方大白和我很是投緣，就引我出來，看蘭厂的園子。二决走到長廊上我才注意卍十字架子上那些盆景。盆子有斗式的，有香爐鼎式的有筒式的，栽了冬靑松柏鳥不宿六月雪各種小樹椿。下面是各種透爪的活樹根，作了小盆架子支住着。就在這種架子上，更配了蒲草五花石小太湖石各種小玩意，我對小說家說：這些玩意雖不過木石之類，並不値什麽錢，可是每一件都支配得有些畫意，很費了他不少的心血。小說家說：人生在世，固然是要作些事業，但是也要找點娛樂。蘭厂是位有名的好好先生，不嫖不賭，甚至聽戲看電影，都不感到多大興趣，更不用談這些摩登玩意。像跳舞之類了。可是他在少年的時候，多少有些類乎羅曼斯的事實，到了哀樂中年，不能不有所寄託，所以他就寄情於花鳥，調劑他枯燥的人生。說着話時我看到架子上，一個尺二的寳藍色磁盤子，託着一個銀色的大北瓜。便笑問說：蘭厂的家庭，是像這瓜一樣的圓滿嗎？大白點點頭說：是的！這團圓的瓜，足以象徵他的家庭。我說到蘭厂的羅曼斯，那不過是過去的事，於今留着一點遺憾而已。我說：人生不必太美滿了，太美滿了，是會遭忌的。不如留一點遺憾，作為晚半輩子的回味，百年之後，供他人憑吊。說着話，我二人就走下了台階，這裏是個長院子，在院子中心，撑了幾棵樹之外，兩邊挨着方格子花籬，砌了一座矮的石花台，花台一叢叢的老綠葉子。大白說：你認得這是什麽花嗎？我看那花的莖，倒有些像草本，在莖上，生出一張張的圓葉子，葉子厚厚的，因為到了深秋的原故，那子尖上還有點紫色。我搖搖頭說：面生得很。我實在看不出來，這是什麽花。（四）</p>

<h3>吳梅村</h3>
<p>— 蔡螫存</p>
<p>三代上人患好名，三代下人患不好名，蓋以人果好名，對於　切敗名之事，必多所顧慮而不背為。苟不好名，不獨蕩檢逾閑，即辱國之恥，亦可恬然安之。吳三桂忘君父之大仇，屈身事虜，其人固不足責者也。一日閱及吳梅村先生所作嫄嫄曲（嫄嫄係三桂妾名，姓陳氏）有云；「痛哭六軍齊縞素，衝冠一怒為紅顏。」又云：「妻子豈應關大計，英雄無奈是多情」。「全家白骨成灰土，一代紅妝照汗靑」等句，三桂讀竟，汗流浹背，惶愧幾無地自容。乃密派員賚萬金往謁梅村，請將此數聯刪改，而梅村旣不受金，亦不改詩，此其所以為詩史也。</p>

<h3>「顏語」一則正誤</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>「諺語」就是「俗語」，解釋起來，就是一般人嘴裏流行的話。祇因這些話，都是前人或近人，根據各種事實，及生活體騐等方面，得到了閱歷而發出來的話！所以，它能够普遍的掛於大衆齒頰，並且流傳千古。</p>
<p>可是，有些諺語，因為年深日久，輾轉誤傳，以致失却本義，或竟變成反話的也很多着，那就不足益世，或且害世了</p>
<p>醫如：「耳不掏不聾，眼不醫不瞎」，這兩句話，誰不背誦如流呢？照我看來，就很錯誤。你想，耳裏積滿耳矢，正是致病之由，掏掉了，正可免聾，怎麽反而會聾？眼睛有了毛病，不去醫治，焉有不瞎之理？所以，我以為這兩句話裏，定有音同義異的兩個字，纏夾在裏面而誤傳了。仔細一想，吾得之矣！為它仍換上兩倘音近而義正的字，改正如下：「耳不掏必聾，眼不翳不瞎。</p>

<h3>為中國地政學會進一言</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>——對於第三屆年會之希望——</p>
<p>中國地政學會開第三屆年會於杭州，今巳三日。夫土地問題為今日中國農付問題中之首要問題，而該會又為硏究中國土地問題之最高學術機關，會員縱跡，散布全國；即中央及地方之地政機關，亦大半為該會之團體會員。今得會合全國專家，集議於萬綠千紅之西子湖畔；其為萬衆景仰，固非偶然也。</p>
<p>吾國土地分配不均，實為今日農村禍亂之源。最近各方統計，證明全國耕地幾有半數握於地主之手；佃豐每年所納田組，起過二十萬萬元。農民胼手胝足，終年不得一雔，因此挺而走險者，比比皆是。此土地問題之所以急待解决者一也。吾國土地使用分散，阻礙生產技術之進步。據最近中央農業實騐所統計，二十畝以下之狹小經營，在華北各省佔百分之四八。六；在華南各省即十畝以下之經營竟佔百分之叫九·五。此等狹小農塲，即人力畜力亦難充分利用，遑論利用機械；所得收穫，自不能與先淮各國爭勝巿場。此土地問題之所以急待解决者二也。</p>
<p>中國地政學會以「研究土地問題，促進土地改革」為宗旨，孜孜屹屹，於今三年。「第一年係偏於純理論之硏究；而集中其重耍點於土地改革基本學理之介紹，及土地政策原則之討論，與夫農村復興與土地問題之關係。第二年漸進而為中國具體士地問題之研究，及歐西各國政策之介紹；而集中於各省巿土地行政之檢討。第三年則更進而為土地法規及土地金融，租佃制度，田賦問題之硏究」（見該會總務理事業錚先生所著「中國地政學會與中國改革運動）。循序漸進，巳由理論而進至實施階段；其努力固為吾輩之所欽仰，其景響亦非吾輩所敢輕視。</p>
<p>雖然，中國土地問題至今仍未絲毫解决，此固母庸諱言。自國民政府定鼎以來，黨國英佼，亟謀實施，總理所訂平均地權政策，然而於今九年，似仍未能掃除實施上之種種障礙。蓋平均地權之終極目標，非為整理土地，而為土地制度之澈底改革；即耕者有其田」是。此種改革固為全民族之福利，然仍難免不受少數土劣之反對。因此平均地權不僅為一法規問題，抑月為一力量問題；即如何扶植農民，剷除土劣，使平均地權政策得以暢行無阻。中國地政學會過去硏究各國土地改革歷史，及各省土地行政情形；以謀制定完善法規，力求實施上之便利。此後希望更能進而注意於農民之組織及訓練問題，並與社敎機關取得聯絡。此所望於大會諸君者一也。</p>
<p>土地制度之改革，固非「　可就·在耕者有其田尙未實現之前，似摩力謀减輕無地農民之負担。國民政府北伐以前，即以二五减租為解决農民問題之首要工作；至今二五减租之原則，仍全部包含於中央及各省土地法規之中。然而二五减租政策之能切實執行者，就編者所知而論，全國恐僅浙江一省；即在浙江亦仍時受環境影響，未能普週推行。二五减租政策之實施經騐更明示吾人，任何土地改革政策，决不能完成於地中豪紳之手。平湖地主之變减租條例為加租條例（詳見東方雜誌三十四卷二十四期吳曉晨平湖的租佃制度和二五减租），即其一例。中國地政學會本屆年會規定以「租佃問題」及「航空測量」為討論範圍，復以推行二五减租政策最有成效之浙江省會為其集議地點；深望能對二五减租政策之推行經過，及其失敗原因，作一澈底研究，提出有效辦法，呈請中央及各省政府採擇施行。此所望於大會諸君者二也。</p>
<p>解决土地分配問題之外，允應進而解决土地使用問題。蓋耕者有其田如不能與集體耕作制度相輔並進，則農耕技術不能進步，終不免受國際競爭之淘汰。我國之農村合作運動，至今仍多限於信用及運銷方面；至於合作農場之組織，尙多困難本期祝平先生於其所著土地統制文中，會提議擬以合作方式厲行集體化，以提高土地之經濟使用，中國地政學會似應體察國情積極研討，俾得澈底解决我國土地問題。此所望於大會諸君者三也。</p>
<p>以上三點，當為大會諸君三年來所深思熟慮。藉此機會，略仲愚見，並祝中國地政學會進步無疆，</p>
<h3>中國耕地散碎原因之檢討</h3>
<p>— 張丕介</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>耕地散碎現象在中國農充區域內至為普週，事實上已成為中國農業政策上之最不易解决之嚴重問題；然而猶未引起國人之深切注意。依作者研究（參喋地政週刋第七十一期）土地零碎定義之中包有兩種現象：第一是關於農業政策方面的，即農用土地，割裂為數過多，而面積過小的經營單位，其經濟力量之單弱，不足實現農業在國民經濟上之使命，第地理關於農業技衡方面的，即一個農　經營單位，其所有之地段零星狹小，東西分散，不相接連，不能適用新式進步的農數技術。根據這個定義來觀察中國農業現狀，我們一定得到一種會自己十分吃驚的結果：中國耕地已大部份淪落於分割零碎現象之下了！</p>
<p>就大體上論之，中國耕散地散碎現象國發生之原因不同，可分為兩大別：長江以北多為自耕土地，和江以南多為佃耕地，有許多地方兩種現象不相軒輊，有許多地方則互有消長。然而其結果則無不相同，卽在技術方面造成所謂地段混淆狀態（Gemengelage），夰在經濟方面則形成無數的生存能力不足抵抗能力薄弱之過小農塌。此種情形之不利於農　，不待多論。茲所欲研究者，則為發生此種現象之原因。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>耕地散碎現象之原因有直接的與間接的兩種。所謂直接原因者，即社會組織與社會制度作用之結果，所謂間接原因者，即與社會制度無關，在任何社會中郁有發生之可能之原因。以下當分別論之。</p>
<p>耕地散碎之直接的原因有三：第一為諸子分承法；第二為土地買賣自由，第三為大私有地之迭成。凡此三者皆為中國社會組織及社會制度數千年來繼續作用之必然結果，而其影響所及，則成耕地散碎之現象。</p>
<p>諸子分承法　土地及其他財產所有人死亡後，一切所有均歸子女中之一人繼承者為一子獨承制，反之各子女權利平等，按數均分者，謂之諸子分承制。中國之諸子分承制，為時巳久，大概自土地私有制確定，卽實行此制，未嘗稍有變更。不過所謂諸子分承繼制者，在中國實為不澈底之形式。蓋只有男子一方有繼承權，而女子則向無參加資格也。新民法雖賦女子以平等權利，但在實際上仍未能普遍的施行。</p>
<p>何以諸子分承制為耕地散碎之直接原因？今假　在江蘇農夫甲有耕地二百畝，不可謂少。可假定甲有子女乙丙丁戊四人，在普通農村之中，不可謂多。依諸子分承法，甲死則土地均分為四等分，其子女乙等各得五十畝之遺產。以五十畝之田供八口之家之生活，尙可維持。倘乙等父各有子女四人則乙等死後，此原來之二百畝將分為十六等分，甲之孫輩每人所得才止一二·五畝弱。於是中等以上之農場不三世而成為過小之農　單位矣。如此世復一世，分而又分，任何農場之最後結果，無不淪於零星分散者。『無五日不變之天，亦無五世不敗之業。』西人實行一子獨承者嘗有所謂『農民世家』（Baueruedei），往往數百年維持舊業使規模日大，基礎日固，造成農業社會之中心勢力。此種情形在我國普遍的實行諸子分承制之下，恐夢想不及也。</p>
<p>土地買賣自由　在土地私有制度之下土地買賣自由乃當然之現象。土地所有人受法律之保障，有權自由處理其土地，自由分割，自由負債，自由買賣。中國過去對於自由買賣未嘗加以限制。雖官吏有時不得公開經營地產，然而限制與事實相反，向來作大宗土地買賣者不是在朝的官吏，也是與他們有關的人物。此種現象可惜至今未改。</p>
<p>何以土地買賣自由足以造成耕地散碎現象？土地買賣自由的過程是這樣的：一方面耕地集中於少數的大地主手中，形成富者連阡陌的狀態。另一方面農民土地範圍縮小，漸漸淪落於單位水準之下。大地主的土地又多半用「零租式」分租於若干小佃戶，於是每個戶所得也與範圍縮小的農民相似。</p>
<p>本來旣說土地買賣自由，為何農民却不使用此自由？或不出賣土地以維持其農塲？或與大地主競爭，購入土地以擴充其經營單位？然而就實際言之，所謂土地買賣自由者，純為單方面的自由。農民在繼續的被壓迫剝削之下，不是欠債過重，便是謀生無術，所以「不得不」出賣土地。在農村金融組織不發達，高利貸如日中天的社會中縱欲購入少許土地，而苦無流動資本可資挹注。於是自由之利用乃純為少數有勢力者偏面之權利。</p>
<p>大私有地之造成。中國旣實行普遍的諸子分承制依理土地分割零碎現象既不可免，農業單位面積應普遍的狹小了，然而何以同時還有大私有地之造成？豈非自相矛盾予？惟據實際調查證明，中國確有——尤以長江以南為最甚——甚多之過大地主。此種地主之產生大約不外　稅原因：　昔日之達官顯宦，如李鴻章，曾憑藉其地位攫奪大宗土地，遺留於其子孫。因為時尙未太久，故雖曾分割，而百足之蟲，死而不優，仍保持此龐大規模。　新興政客與軍閥，憑藉此現其威力與資力：繼續的為土地購置。如王占元不過舊軍閥中之二等角色，然其土　已自漢口迄大津，沿途不絕。凡地邊界石上書「南館福王者皆其土地。　商　兼作土地經營者，投此一部份資本於農村，購置大宗農地。因連年荒旱太甚，地價慘跌，此種投機事　實至為活躍。</p>
<p>大私有地之影響於土地散碎者與上節土即買賣自由相同，惟其作用更進一步而已。凡大私有地所在之地方，必有一部份農民受其壓迫，至於破產，成為農業無產階級。苟不甘　死，卽須為大地主之佃戶，經營少許之土地，中其血汗之收穫以飽其苛求。歐美大地主多親自經營其農業，因其目光遠大，資本雄厚，往往成為規模良好之先進農塲。至於中國大地主旣不事經營，徒為國民經濟之寄生物耳。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>耕地散碎之間接原因有二：第一為晨業人日之過剩；第二為中國之村莊制底。</p>
<p>農業人口過剩。是吾今日中國已有人口過剩現象，作者於此不願多論。然而農業方面人口之過剩則為不可吾認之事實。農業人口過剩現象有三方面之意義：　以整個的國民經濟言，中國農業經濟至今猶為國民經濟之主體，而人口之生活於田間者過於全國人口百分之八十。其他國民經濟部份如工業，商業，交通業等，皆未發達。因此種國民經濟結構之不健全，使全國人口中百分之八十集中農業。　以農業言，中國農業區域只限於沿海及中原數省，所佔面積才及全國三分之一。因此中國百分八十之人口集中於全國之一小部份土地。　以農業內部組織言，中國農、生產偏重於原始的谷物生產，除少數地方例外，無甚副業可言。故此百分八十之人口集居於全國三分之一之土地，而又蝟集於最簡單之土地生產。然則農業人口口過剩不可否認的事實與最不良之經濟現象明矣。</p>
<p>因諸子分承法之普遍，使此過剩之人口有平均取得土地之機會，其結　則人口愈多，每人平均所得愈少，而耕地分割愈為零碎。「有土　有民，有民面有分，「我們可補充」句：民多則土少，分多則零碎。」</p>
<p>（二）中國之材莊制。任何民族，當其團始佔領地球影面之　部份時，都有　種居住形式。遊牧民族用不固定的帳幕式，逐水草而居焉。農業民族則採用定居式，或　族而成，則為村莊之起源，或散居於所有之土地，則為單戶制。中國是以村莊為常態而以單戶制為例外的國家，數千年來之進化演變，使村莊組織日臻嚴密，範團日加擴大，而政治之不安定，使小村莊不能自術，遂　始合併，使大者更大。至於倫理道德宗敎亦提倡　族同居，造成聚居之基礎。中國自南至北，自東至西，無處不普通的實行大村莊制。而以人口之稠密，隨至村與村之間距離愈小。各村所佔土地面積雖無統計，然其數必不少亦可斷言者。</p>
<p>村莊制何以為土地散碎之原因？農民旣聚處於村莊，則其土地必四散於村之四週。此為與單戶制之至大區別，即單制下農場與住宅多在一處，出門即是耕地，往返旣少，時間即省，工作方便，監視容易。村莊制下之農民居於村之中心，與土地距離甚大。而多數村莊以治安需要更建築圍寨，僅留少數出人之門戶。於是凡土地不適在門戶外者，必繞道紆迴，多費時間。村莊愈大，此種情形即會為顯著。明淸格爾氏（Munzinger）曾研究德國南部村莊制下所浪費之時間為工作時間百分之三十，殊可驚人。倘分割零碎之耕地在住宅附近，農民尙有機會使之漸漸歸併，成為一有意義之合理接連；今有村莊道路為之阻碍，農民雖感不便，實無法補救。甲地能在村之近處，乙之地勢不能不被隔離，况多數小塊土地東西散亂，並無出入道路，如欲達於工作處所，勢非經過鄰地不可，於是人畜踐踏，又為不可避免之損害。　　中國耕地分散零碎之情形至為普遍，其原因業如上述。凡曾親歷其境，或留意農業技術者，類能覺察此種不良現象之遺害無窮也。</p>
<h3>實行計劃經濟與「土地統制」</h3>
<p>— 祝平</p>
<p>一、計劃經濟之涵義</p>
<p>自由放任之資本主義經濟藩籬，已被經濟恐慌之洪濤衝毀，經濟　慌將成為資本主義經濟之葬鐘；由於資本主義經濟之日趨沒落，而計劃經濟即代之而起。計劃經濟為有組織有計劃之經濟制度，與資本主義經濟之無政府無組織之經濟制度逈異。資本主義生產行為，是以個人利潤為出發點，受盲目之市場供求律所支配，致招徠不可避免之週期式經濟恐慌，而自掘墳墓之資本主義經濟制度，耶將葬送於此。計劃經濟生產原則，則以社會福祉為出發點。為適應人羣合理的需要，故能擯除資本主義制度下經濟矛盾與經濟恐慌之弊害，而為社會經濟發展至現在階段最合理之經濟制度也。邇　一般舉者，每以計劃經濟與統制經濟　者相提並論，以計劃經濟與統制經濟混作一談，更有謂計劃經濟是統制經濟之理想，統制經濟是計劃經濟的實行，議論紛紜，莫衷　是，殊不知計劃經濟與統制經濟在形態上雖屬相似，而在本質上則逈然不同，茲將計劃與統制經濟之分野，說明於後：</p>
<p>計劃經統制經濟之分野　計劃經濟為積極的經濟政策，乃一種新的合理的經濟形態，實施計劃經濟，須將整個國民經濟，如生產交換分配消費諸方面，都製成彼此聯系之精密計劃，此項計劃由政府加以集中統制，使國民經濟活動，成為有機構成體。實施計劃經濟之國家，其國民經濟的動向，以計劃為體，統制為用，以統制之手段達到計劃之目的。至於統制經濟則為消極的經濟政策，乃資本主義發達到最後階段之國家，為要解除其不可避免的經濟發展之矛盾，而產生的一種補救的辦法，所以在本質上，是與計劃經濟是根本不同的。</p>
<p>中國所需要者為計劃經濟　中國經濟的發展尙未達到現代資本主義國家之水準，同時帝國主義的經濟勢力，籠罩着我國整個的國民經濟，使我們呻吟於外來資本主義的桎梏之下而不克解脫，我們對於原有的經濟制度，無所用其顧惜，是用不到去維持牠　救牠的，我們是要突破了舊有制度的牢籠才會有出路。所以我們是不需要消極的修補式的統制經濟來維持這舊經濟制度，而是要積極的創造的根據民族環境的需要而建立一個三民主義的計劃經濟制度，民生主義的經濟政策，為站在整個民族經濟平等的立場，謀國民經濟之發展，實施　民主義的計劃經濟，一方而經濟建設有集中的統制，作有計劃的推進，使生產得到合理的迅速的發展；另一方面生產的結果，不致受少數人之支配與壟斷，在分配上自能得到公平之享受。為繁榮中國經濟計，為解决中國民生問題計，捨實行計劃經濟外，實無他途也。</p>
<p>二、土地問題在計劃經濟中之地位</p>
<p>中國目前所需要的是計劃經濟，上面已大略的說明了，現在再把計劃經　與土地問題的關係，來觀察一下。計劃經濟下之國民經濟基本部門，如工業農業貿易以及運輸交通等經濟活動，均須為有計劃的聯系統計，但是一切經齊活動，都離不了土地，所以要統制人種經濟活動，必是統制土地。土地問題為計劃經濟之基本問題，如土地問題不得適當解决，計劃經濟即不能得正軌之發展，故計劃經濟與土地問題，實有切膚之關係。</p>
<p>（一）土地與社會經濟之關係　土地為人類生存的基本條件，為社會生產之源泉，人類生存端賴經濟，經濟之起原即緣於土地，無　個人或社會之經濟生活，離却土地，即失其憑藉，社會經濟之種種關係，都由土地發生，社會經濟之發達與吾，均視土地之分配利用之是否得當為斷。人類賴以生存之衣食住等消費貨財，無一不產生於土地，如土地之用途，自妨碍人類公共之福利，或土地受少數所壟斷時，即直接影響社會經濟之發展，社會經濟發展旣受障碍，人類生存即發生缺陷，而社會上之動亂與糾紛因之而起，土地與社會經濟之實質，請再申述之：</p>
<p>（A）土地為生產要素經濟活動之基本行為為生產，無生產即無衣食住行等消費貨財，無消費貨財，則根木無社會經濟之活動，而人類之需要無由供給，生產之要素分為三種：即土地資本及勞力，此一種要素，允以土地為首耍，更明首之，達到生產之目的，必須備上述三種生產工具，如缺其一，生產即不能成立。往昔工商業未發達時代，人類即直接依土地而生，對於土地之關係更為密切，迄至現代科學昌明，工商業進步，在表面十觀之土地似無直接之關係，然細察之土地實有不可分離之作用，如工業脫離土地，則失却一切原料之供給，工人給養失其來源，商業脫離土地，更無貨物交換與商品流轉之可言，此可見土地非但為生產之要素，且為社會一切經濟活動之源泉。</p>
<p>（B）發展經濟必先統制經濟　土地旣為生產之要素，生產父為經濟之起源，提高生產應首先解决生產上之主要問題：一方面現要集中大量資金，努力生產　設，招致多數勞働，促進生產效能；另方面要土地問題之解决，使土地本身生產力之提高，也為發展社會一切經濟生產力之急務，故發展經濟建設，提高生產力，統制土地來解决土地問題，實為先行之條件，土地問題之產生，係少數人壟斷土地所致，使社會公共福利源泉，由社會公有轉為私人所獨享。因此，土地利用之廢弛與地利之棄置，成為必然之現象，社會經濟之畸形發展，乃因土地問題之嚴重情形，同軌而並進，現在統制土地之方，應站在社會公共福利之立場，將土地之所有權與使用權，公諸社會所有，以達到地盡其利之目的。</p>
<p>（C）計劃經濟與土地問題之關係　實施計劃經濟之先行條件，第一須有集權政府，始有推行之力量；第二生產機關與生產者，須有嚴密之組織，始有計劃與統制之可能，第三對於現有經濟狀况，須有精確之調查與統計，使所訂計劃切於實行，此外當有一重要條件，即第叫統制生產要素——如土地，營慟，資本等是也。苟土地制度不健全，如分配不均或利用失當，或大量地權，為少數私人所壟斷，則計劃經濟即根本無從實施。故實施計劃經濟，應光　土地問題之解决，解决土地問題，即為實行計劃經濟之前提：</p>
<p>（A）土地問題在計劃經濟中之重要性　計劃經濟將整個國民經濟，組成有計劃之構成，土地乃為計劃經濟機體中之重要組成部分如土地制度成為病態象，即影響國民經濟不健全，而計劃經濟推行乃受障碍，計劃經濟下土地問題能得適常解决，一切農業工業等部門之經濟計劃，方能順利推行，故欲推行計割經濟，應先解决土地問題，土地問題解决後，計劃經濟上重要生產工具　問題，才可隨之而解决，計劃經濟能有正軌的發展，土地問題在計劃經濟中之重要性，由此可以窺他一斑。</p>
<p>（B）計劃經濟之土地政策　土地問題在計劃經濟中既如此重要，計劃經濟之土地政策，當然為决定計劃經濟中各種經濟政策之基本政策了。計劃經濟的土地政策之原則，要使需要土地的人，都能有獲得土地的機會，土地的自然利益，應該歸之於社會全體，同時，全部土地的使用分配，應該在整個計劃之下，為合理的進行。</p>
<p>三、實施計劃經濟與「土地統制」</p>
<p>中國經濟建設，應實施計劃經濟，已毫無疑義，而土地問題之澈底解决，為實施計劃經濟之迫切前提，亦巳瞭然矣。惟實施經濟計劃之土地政策，應如何確立，尙有待吾人之商討。夫一般土地問題之發生，皆由於土地所有與使用之無政府的盲目的畸形發展，目前中國土地問題之癥結，亦即在於此，中國土地分配之不台理與利用之不經濟，已為昭明之事實，中國農村社會動亂狀態之掀起，此亦為最大原因，如何謀土地所有與使用上矛盾之解决，實施目前土地問題的主要內容，解决此種矛盾之道，應依照總理平均地權之原則，根據整個經濟計劃的需要，實施「土地統制」。</p>
<p>至實施「土地統制」之原則，的有下列數端：</p>
<p>一、公有土地原屬各種行政機　分別保管者　，應即由地政機關集中管理，以便通盤計劃。</p>
<p>二、地方公共團體管有土地應由主管地政機關接管，並依照整個經濟建設計劃之規定，促進利用，至其所有收益，原充地方公共事業之用者，仍照撥；</p>
<p>三、寺廟及私人團體管有土地，應山主管地政機關監督整理，並促進利用，增如生產，削除浪費；</p>
<p>四、私人所有土地，應在整個經濟建設原則之下，由地政機關監督指導，以合作方式，厲行集體化，調整其所有關係，提高其經濟使用；</p>
<p>五、所有市地，林地，礦山，水源，漁地，牧地，鹽灶地，以及其他公用土地，應一律由主管地政機關接收管理，並依照整個經濟建設計劃之規定，分別撥交或租與各種機關團體或私人利用。</p>
<p>四、結語</p>
<p>上述各節，僅略舉其梗概，惟吾人欲謀土地問題之解决，健全的土地制度之確立，以及計劃經濟之實施，則「土地統制」，實為必要之前提，吾國計劃經濟之呼聲巳甚囂塵上，而實行計劃經濟之條件　未能具備，自「通貨管理」之制實施，計劃經濟在金融制度上之條件，巳屬粗備，倘再能將其他生產要素——土地與勞働——實行統制——即實行「土地統制」與「勞慟統制」，則計劃經濟之實施，國民經濟之繁榮，庶有豸乎！</p>

<p>壯健之人，必有强大之食慾；而食慾昂盛，則因有健全之胃機能也。故大食大飲者，其人恒體魄雄偉。若胃口呆弱，消化不良，必致面黃身瘦，孱弱多病，是以胃納為最不容忽視之事。范成玉君，年三十。因受寒食减，竟轉胃呆，不思飲食，時作氣脹，時而險疼，時而翻嘔，時而吐酸，服藥雖减，藥去而病又來；致身弱多病，衰憊殊甚！嗣求治於余。經囑服德國「强胃精」，頓見食慾强大，口中津津有味，乃自行安心續服月許，各恙盡瘥，且面紅身健，大異昔年。値狼虎之會，食量過人，一座咸驚！查此藥力厚性純，毫無刺激，且因含有脾素（內　荷爾蒙，更善補血補腦，兼含維他命B.D.，擅療脚氣，壯補全身。</p>
<h3>遺精衰弱根治</h3>
<p>— 本埠胡大純來稿</p>
<p>至友聶人杰，本一英慧靑年，讀書過目成誦，惟因耽閱不良小說，以致發生自凟惡癖，靑春腺傷損，發育不良，且有遺精，滑精，陰莖勃起力退减之現象，而頭腦脹悶，精神萎頓，面容憔悴，記憶力全失，失眠，視力减弱，病態畢露，蓋已入早衰之境。而又迫於嚴命，還家結婚，聶君益窘，乃走問於余，遂介紹共購服德國梅倫博士發明之『補體康』，幸聶君悛改過去手淫之癖，服此藥四五瓶後，即覺生機勃起，精滑等症，隨即除去，筋肉强壯，面貌豐腴而紅潤，新婚中夫婦愛情圓滿，余因是深悉『補體康』功效之偉，曾連續介紹數人，功效均卓特而優異云。</p>
<h3>鄧源和醫師肺病臨床實騐錄　欬血遺精回復壯健</h3>
<p>患者劉立功君，年二十五，學界。病歷—早歲自凟，又傷房勞，身虧體憊。病狀—欬血頻發，嗆嗽痰稠，胸部隱痛，心悸盜汗，食慾减少，失眠遺精，腎萎無力。屢服製劑，終欠確效；體日尫贏。由同級李經國君介紹，投余求治。處方—聽診呈水泡音，檢痰發現癆菌。病勢進行，非普通製劑所能濟事。即囑安靜臥養，大量進服德國「補肺拿爾」凝血除痰，滅癆止欽。同時囑服德國「補體康」以治失眠及腎病。的三星期，所患頓失，沉疴盡起。且胃納大增，精神煥發！乃自行續服前藥數瓶，以期根治。咋接其謝函，謂愈後雖大勞不倦，且夫婦愛好逾恒云。</p>
<h3>血痰欬嗆頓獲根治</h3>
<p>患者關素娟女士，年二十四，文界。病勝—過於用腦，傷於勞瘁。病狀—欬嗆氣急，痰中帶血。胃弱肢軟，眩暈心悸。月經落後，多夢少眠。迭治莫愈，衰弱不堪。去春始自投余處求診。處方—光檢查，肺病已至第三期，即對症投藥，主用「補肺拿爾」治愈其血痰欬嗆；同時兼服「補女容」以調經補腦，治其衰弱。為期月許，果獲全治。夜眠酣適，體重銳增。年久癆患，一旦根瘳！恐防再發，續服前藥旬餘。日前以事來所，見其面色紅潤，肌肉充盈，回復健美。據謂每値握管，文思潮湧，精神彌佳云。</p>
<h3>德國淋病特效藥　克淋儂實騐寫眞</h3>
<p>— 盛在强</p>
<p>（一）尿意急促</p>
<p>患者范宙雲君，年廿六歲，住蒲柏路，於民國廿一年某决酒後，攀柳致染淋病。會經求醫注射服藥，未見根治，尿望恒覺頻數，排尿則又不暢，混有血點，小腹脹滿，覺有蓄尿不盡之感，晕丸微痛而腫大，此尿道狹窄及畢丸炎也。即囑服『克淋儂』，俾根治淋舊，未三星期，小便通暢，尿液澄潔，少腹寬暢，畢腫平復，繼服一星期而全愈。惟其夫人陰門糜爛，白帶甚多，此實由范君傳染無疑。乃內服『克淋儂』，外用『卡而雪地氏陰道片」，服未及四星期，亦已全愈。屢受刺戟，從未復發云。</p>
<p>（二）尿道膿血交流</p>
<p>患者朱少堯君，年十九歲，為娼妓所誘，遂感淋病，尿道初時刺癢而痛，繼即感排尿不快，又未幾尿道中膿血交流，龜頭龐大，包皮炎腫，痛苦不堪，即來余處醫治，乃為之滌淸外尿道後，即投以「克淋儂」，的未及三星期，即見痛止腫退，小便淸瑩，後又行血淸檢查十餘次，從未有陽性反應，其獲根治，斷無可疑矣。所以「克淋儂」一藥久巳風行歐美，凡著名大醫家，莫不競相採用，故自此藥發明以來，較前所患人數，竟減少百分之七八。亦可想見「克淋儂」效力之宏偉也。</p>
<h3>男女性神經之衰老</h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>人之衰老，由於男女兩性荷爾蒙之减少或缺乏。故欲挽救此種早衰，或使靑春期延長，均不得不補充荷爾蒙，使全身之生活力，得以維繫於不弊，此種臟器療法，實人類最大之幸福也。顧男女在靑春發育之時代，缺乏性知識，每被惡朋劣友所惑，濫犯手淫，或因早婚，縱慾敗度，斯皆為性神經衰老之主因。</p>
<p>在兩性早衰之經過中，男子為遺精，早洩，陰莖勃起力不壯，女子為月經失調，白帶下等，其症象則為久婚不孕，失眠，精神沈鬱，心緒惡劣，頭目眩暈，記憶力不佳，肌肉消瘦，皺紋覆額，頭髮焦黃，毫不感到人生興趣，故每易陷入悲觀厭世之途。德國梅倫博士深慨靑春男女之痛苦，乃發明用雄性獸類之睪丸，及雌性獸類之卵巢，以科學新方法提出新鮮荷爾蒙，製成『補體康』（男用）及『補女容』（女用）二藥，以補給二性荷爾蒙之缺乏，使生殖系之組織，獲得徹底之改造，故早衰者，得恢復原來之健美，一切性神經衰弱，久婚失姙，月經不調，白帶下等，胥於是時獲愈。故「補體康」與「補女容」二藥之為全球男女兩界所歡迎，實以其有去病駐春之效也。</p>
<h3>淋藥之最理想製劑</h3>
<p>自二十世紀科學日進，醫學上對於各科疾病治療，莫不各有相當成績；惟獨淋病之毒燄鴟張如故，何也？固非山於淋藥缺乏；反之實汗牛而充楝！良以驅淋之道，不宜過猛，猛則誅伐雕辜，服之未受其益，先蒙其害；又不宜太鈍，鈍則緩不濟急，莫能阻遏病勢。是以淋藥雖多，求其具有確效而無流弊者殊屬少見。遂使淋菌猖獗綦烈！各國政府，乃特設研究機關，多方實驗，卒有德國淋病聖藥『克淋儂』之發明，全歐著名醫院，遂競相採用，成效卓著。蓋以此藥效宏質純，緩不傷鈍，無過烈與不及等流弊，為最合於剿撫兼施之原則製劑。服後確能全部根治；無論急慢性淋疾及併發症，均能驅毒務盡，一掃而除！據各國大醫院統計，服此迅獲根治者，男子達百分之九十七人以上，女子因服藥有恒心，並因有『卡而雪地氏陰道片』外治法，竟百試百騐，不爽毫厘，故近頃全歐醫家病家，無不賞用此藥也！（節譯去年十二月份德國醫刊報吿。）</p>
<h3>遠年淋濁一旦霍然</h3>
<p>— 張夢竹來稿</p>
<p>余夙罹淋濁，醫治乖誤，遂成頑疾。大便用力時，涓流濁絮。困苦煩劇！前秋又復畢丸腫硬，痛楚滋深。醫謂兩舉俱腫，生育絕望。夫婦悲慟逾恒。而余病愈陷愈烈！形體柴瘦。幸自投姚菊巖醫師處求治，經其第一星期用短波電療，疼痛即减；二星期用X線治療，即見畢腫軟化，放尿暢利。遂於第三星期主用德國最新發明之『抗淋血淸』療治，頓獲腫痛全消，尿液淸瑩。又為余行手術按摩，得吿精神奮發，壯健日增。今歷年半，未嘗復發。腎部强盛，生機復萌。此固皆姚醫師所賜！用特誌謝，藉為同病寳筏！</p>
<h3>婦女不可吿人之隱病</h3>
<p>— 金月仁</p>
<p>諺曰，「十男九痔，十女九帶」，足見白帶病流行於婦女界之盛。考其原因，皆由怕羞，延宕失治，任其蔓延，身體健康，因之破減，息者膣中時流膿性之分泌液，有時癈癢，有時灼熱，甚者影響小便之排洩，外陰部亦糜爛而痛，奧穢之氣，中人欲嘔，患者因此，更為沈鬱，余遇此症即囑其購用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，在家自療，輒獲奇效，且用時局部愉快異常，毫無汚膩之弊。如因淋病而患白帶者，與「克淋儂」同時服用，效力允為顯著，蓋一則殺菌消炎，一則殺菌而收歛，故功效自亦卓特不羣云。</p>
<h3>痰多之害</h3>
<p>— 戴德</p>
<p>痰多之人，大率息有慢性氣管枝加答兒症。若炎症增劇，每釀致肺炎。老年及小兒多起呼吸困難，每有發生危險者！故患者慎勿延誤。余臨床實騐，最賞用德國「補肺拿爾」一藥，對於本症不過四五瓶，即能淸除痰液。其療允屬神效。故善治傷風及小兒百日咳。且因含有鱉魚比目魚及熊鹿之肝肺脾等臟器荷爾蒙，培元固本，擅療一二三各期肺癆。又兼富含蛋黃素，用於精神萎靡，煙客咳嗽及戒癮，允為對症。若連服月許不斷，必見食增體健，百病不侵。</p>

<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病臨床報吿</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>久染淋病致捐神經</p>
<p>生殖器部份，為全身感覺最銳敏之所，蓋此處富於神經也。若淋菌侵入該處，其初起者，局部往往由疼痛而致失神，甚者永失去其生殖力。苟延誤而致淋菌潛入深進，性神經之受傷尤互，故每見陰莖勃起力脆弱，或作灼熱性之勃起而遺精，若取其精液用八百倍顯微鏡檢查，則可見其中有無數精虫與淋菌相搏戰，更有許多膿血球附雜其間，形狀之險，令人不寒而慄。如不將淋菌根本肅淸之，則精虫被淋菌所殺，勢必成為不姙之原因。</p>
<p>此病旣因淋菌而致性神經衰弱，務必雙方並治，余　治任永年君，久困淋病，繼發遺精，陰莖勃起銳敏，房事時又作疼痛性之射精。夫婦不姙，迄已多年。余即以抗淋血淸及電氣療法，內服則為「克淋儂」及「補體康」二藥同用，因「克淋儂」可以驅淋利尿止痛。「補體康」能挽弱為强，改造生殖系之組織。服用月餘病即霍然根治。又以其夫人有淋毒性白帶甚多，仍由余囑其購用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，內服「克淋儂」，亦四星期而愈。至今三年已獲一男一女矣。</p>

<h3>腦神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑</p>
<p>腦為人之主幹部部，意志發揮，思想馳逞，都出樞幹部使命，至為重要。若腦不健全，由事事不能充分發揚，現代靑年感腦力不强，因而失却幸福，甚有戕身過度，而為不治之症。推其原感神經衰弱所錄，考本症之開始，雖有因先天不足，後天失調，然天都由於惡習之摧殘，或房事過度，此外如度勤學，神經過敏，持久精神作業等等，都能使腦神經衰弱，本症之完美服劑，莫「安爾神」若Arolsen，蓋是劑富含有機性燐及內分泌等固腎藥物，故凡神經系統，皆能奏其滋補之效，如遺精早洩等性機能衰弱現象，服此均得良效。</p>
<h3>淋疾障碍生育</h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>女子淋疾，分尿道淋及子宮淋雨種，尿道淋亦為不潔性交而起，但較好男子輕而易愈，蓋女子尿道廣而短，經尿液頻回之冲注，可不治而愈，不若男子尿道長而具狹尙有彎曲之難治也，子宮淋，大槪係山男子淋急劇時，性交射精年混有淋菌，直接射入子宮，而發生子宮淋症的居多，其病症為惡寒，發熱，頭痛，作惡，嘔吐，下腹疼痛，臥床不起，精神不安，外陰都以分泌物之刺激而生炎症，經休養後，睹症减輕，惟排洩粘性黃綜色不分泌物，由此轉成慢性，倘下腹及骨盤等處，疼痛不去，必引起喇叭管及卵巢之炎症，或子宮內腹炎，則月經必受障碍，而排卵亦蒙其害，對於男子之精虫不能結合，誘起續發性腹膜炎，生命上有取死之轉歸，就是幸免於難，而子宮體受其炎症之壓迫，受胎尤不可能，故女子患有淋疾，宜遠治療，不獨保身，且能裕後，至於治療之法，（一）外用藥，如「淋毒舒樂身」Gono-Serol，不論陰道尿道都可使用。（二）內服藥，如「滅殺淋」Mesalin，新老淋病，均奏確效，（三）注射液，色素製劑及菌苗或抗毒素等，俱有良効，（四）電療，如短波透熱電機及最新療濁機，皆為本症之治助。然此種病症，家庭自療，總嫌不澈底，最好就專醫診治，本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院二樓德籍醫學博士海斯，善治婦科雜症，詢當代婦科之名醫也。</p>
<h3>論治癬</h3>
<p>— 黃明鏡</p>
<p>癬為皮膚病之一種，傳染極易，時發時愈，若不潛心醫治，極難根治，癬之來源，厥為傳染，其於皮膚抵抗力薄弱者更易，通常醫家病家均以是疾為無關大碍，鮮少注意診治，安知澈底圖元，亦非易事，如魚鱗癬然，查本症之治療，電械方面，最好行人工太陽燈或柯羅梅亞燈之照射，藥物方面，近今巳有專製劑，「滅絕菌」Misulzine，該藥有深透皮膚層之功能，得將潛在之癬菌，撲滅凈盡，謂之皮膚病聖藥，誠非虛語。</p>
<h3>淋毒性睪丸炎</h3>
<p>— 成良</p>
<p>初次感染淋病，其症候尙輕，蓋淋病之病源原菌為淋濁雙球菌，此菌自尿道口侵入尿道，所以初發的病，恒為急性前尿道炎，斯時當即速服「滅殺淋」Mesalin　及並行「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-Serol之外和，自是可將淋菌　撲滅，淋病即可根治。若遷延不治，或治療不甚合法，淋菌未能凈殺，於焉淋菌即漸侵入後尿道，由急性淋病轉移為亞急性淋病，再進而成為慢性。由此侵入膀胱而成膀胱炎，侵入攝護腺而成攝護腺炎，一旦侵入睪丸而成睪丸炎。</p>
<p>發淋毒性睪丸炎時，因睪丸之腫大，世俗每謂為小腸氣？不知俗說的小腸氣？乃因小腸從腹腔脫下，墜入陰蘘所致，在醫學上謂之脫腸症，與淋毒性睪丸炎，大相逕庭，蓋淋毒性睪丸炎，完全為淋菌侵入睪丸而發生炎症，為淋病合併症之一種。</p>
<p>本症初起時，除陰蘘中一側之睪丸紅腫疼痛外，腰部甚覺酸痛，有不能起立步履者，本症宜速治，否則遺留硬結，恐難完全消散，治療本症時，除原因的治療須按照淋病處治外，餘如局部之消炎，不可略緩，電械之使用，如蘇魯克司燈，藥物之使用如鈣劑及醋酸鉛等。</p>
<h3>胃痛之原因及療法</h3>
<p>— 人傑</p>
<p>胃痛乃是一種症候，並非疾病的名稱，致發胃痛的病症殊多，除劇甚的足以迅速致命的胃潰瘍，胃癌等外，如急性胃炎，慢性胃炎，胃酸過多症，胃液漏等均足致發胃痛，此種疾患的治療，求諸藥物，乃惟有亞爾加里劑，此種專製劑之優越者，莫「胃寶」若，用「胃寶」非特治胃痛，有特殊之效，即急慢性胃加答兒，胃酸過多症及胃液漏等，均有樂到病除之効，他如消化不良等症，均可服用，又胃痛症在治療期中，宜注意食物，須選擇易於消化者，以流動食物為最宜，切忌硬性不易消化之固形食物及辛辣酸等有刺戟性食以及有腐敗性食物。</p>
<h3>為患淋疾者進一言</h3>
<p>— 凌德</p>
<p>淋疾大家都知道牠是一種難治疾症，此因淋菌一旦侵入人體之後，即深深藏匿於受染者之尿道粘膜上皮細胞之間隙間，南此淋菌體之構造，又為胞衣雙球型，藥力雖欲深入而撲殺之，亦自較水易，治梅之方法多矣，藥液局部先射法，混合淋苗及色素之注射，利尿殺菌劑之內服等可謂極盡治療之能事，然淋菌往往有仍然存在者，此際務必詳行檢騐，否則雖一時呈靜止狀態，遇有相當機會，復現其致炎之作用，積月經年，時發時愈，患者每感失望，殊不知科學昌明如今日，療法之中，又有短波透熱電及最新療濁機之發明，即以內服藥而論，近今發解之治淋聖藥「滅殺淋」Mesalin，眞可謂淋菌之大勁敵，此藥不但具有强力之殺菌作用，兼有消炎定痛製腐利尿之功，余曾屢經施用，無大應手而達全治之功，同時兼行電療注射等法，見效尤偉，因「滅殺淋」富有透膜殺菌之作用，不問菌體包膜以及深藏於粘膜中者，其藥力能深透膜層而直接作用於菌體，以一是般治淋藥所莫及，淋疾乃極普遍之疾患，緣草斯篇，以說名藥之功用與作用也。</p>
<h3>疾病問答</h3>
<p>讀者讀君凡有疾病上之疑問，均可投函垂詢，來函須書寫淸楚，如問題多可列一二三四以分列之，病情和經過，須詳細扼要說明，須書面答覆者。本埠請附復件郵票二分。外埠請附郵票五分。寄上海郵政信箱一六六八號，自當專函答覆。</p>

<p>答：此乃急性淋病，除自己須何飬攝生，忌勞動，忌刺戟性食物外，至於自療之方，可內服「滅殺淋」Mesalin及外用「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-Serol。</p>
<p>紅腫疼痛</p>
<p>（徐祥奎問題）鄙人於一旬前，誤宿倡一次，初無雙異，私心且慰，詎料三日前忽於大腿灣處生一似鶏卵大之核子，以致行走不便，近更紅腫疼痛，又兼寒熱，未識此乃何症，該如何治療，海上何醫院對於花柳病之治療完善妥當，有否電療辦法，不行刀割。</p>
<p>答：此乃橫痃也，橫痃有起因於梅毒，淋病或軟性下疳者，須追原因而治療，本埠法租界寗波路六六號春在醫院善治花柳性病，本症電療法可用蘇魯克司燈照射，是否可以避免開刀，須視確定而後斷。</p>
<p>欲割包皮</p>

<h3>張天師討封號</h3>
<p>— 筱山</p>
<p>我們不會忘記吧？北伐軍奠定江南的時候，道敎的主腦，龍虎山上的張天師，再不能安穩地過活，被驅逐了下山，他一直居留在洋塲的上海，過着那沒落者的安隱的生活。然而，隱久欲動，而這最後的命運已漸漸地顯得凄慘了。當然，他的生產力已沒有了，產業只有一天一天的减少，大有日落西山，奄奄一息之槪。</p>
<p>最近，我們的龍虎山師主又活動起來。也許他感到官的興趣吧，於是請求國府加封賜印，想要風光風光，結果竟遭內部批駁，碰了一個橡皮釘子。</p>
<p>我們知道，天師掌管符錄，世世相傳，備受歷代帝王的尊崇，這次屈尊折節，討個小小封號，內部竟予批駁，未免失了面子了。所以，他當然非常憤懣的咒着：「人心不古！」</p>
<p>然而，我們知道，中國已到了危亡的時代了，人生痛苦，已不是躱在山林里做夢可以生存的。如果張天師要保持一兩千年的威嚴，最好再拿出傳說上的法寶，呼風喚雨，使人間沒有水災旱災，或者到永定河去，壓着水患，或者到陜甘去救旱災，再不然是撒豆成兵，到東北去指揮信仰神靈的不幸的奴隸們收復失地，爭取回自由，財產，……因為我們知道，無論什麼，非要有物質做我們的基底，不可生存的，難道張天師在國府討個封號就可以神威大振的嗎？能夠救濟許多蹈於火熱水深的大衆們嗎？更同樣地，得了官的銜頭，就可以把龍虎山整頓起來嗎？</p>
<p>然而，我們知道，張天師非要跟大衆們一樣走，那是不能生存或保存他的神威的。我們希望大衆們別做那走不通的路的夢吧！</p>

<p>老年的縫鞋匠魯升差不多每天傍晚的時候，總要跑到鎭外的小火車站去，迎送着每一列車輛，他是那樣緊張地一刻不放鬆的用他底昏花的老眼去搜尋着每一個乘客，是不是他所晨夕惦念着腦子裏的記憶去向着每一個乘客對證着，他是那樣的熱切，有時候他屏住了呼息，恐怕在偶爾的不注意中將他失掉。</p>
<p>已經有六七天了，他眼看着火車慢慢地爬進了站，在汽笛底尖聲之后又慢慢地爬了出去，以至消逝在黑暗中；但他所得到的只是一個沉重的失望，在眼前穿來穿去的都是些不相干的人們。別人歡笑着互相道着久別重逢的話語，是那樣地熱烈的親切地握手，小孩子們唱着跳着……好像不曉得還有一個寂寞年老的縫鞋匠一樣！他是多麼焦急，他在來往的人羣中亂闖，昏花的眼光疲倦地沿着每一個陌生的臉，一顆心樸登樸登地跳着，他高聲的喊呌着！「魯大海」！沙啞的喉嚨嘶裂地狂呌，他要發瘋了！</p>
<p>沒有誰會注意這個老頭子，各人怱忙地做着要做的事。</p>
<p>幾趟車過了之后，站台上的大鐘神氣地指着十二點的數目字，他又感到今天是無望了，他自己哆囉着：「要來早該來了，九點鐘的車呢！九點……」</p>
<p>車站漸趨於冷靜了，他思忖着魯大海所以沒來到的原因：「病了嗎」？「沒有盤費嗎」？「不放他人關嗎」？「…………后來他又像往日一樣地自己寬心地安慰着自己：「！他一定會來的，明天一定，就在明天……」</p>
<p>疲勞鞭打着他向着來路走去，腦海中仍旋轉着一個少年人底影子，他默默地念着些不可知的字句，踉蹌地行在黑暗鄉村小路上艱難地舉着步。</p>
<p>又一個痴望亮在眼前了：「或許在不留意中放過他，這會兒也許早已到家了哪！」於是像打了强心針一樣地，他鼓起勇氣忘掉了一切他很快的走着去追趕在前邊飛奔着的「希望」！</p>
<p>到家門了，他像性驚覺了他兒子一樣的輕輕地推開了門，摸索到桌前，他熟練的抓到了火柴，在劃亮的霎那間他想他底兒子可以出現了，於是他點着了煤油燈。……</p>
<p>他底希望破碎了，眼前仍舊是一所空洞黝黑的屋子，兒子沒有回來！</p>
<p>他傷心，昏花失神的眼睛里落下了淚，像一段木頭一樣地倒在床上，把臉埋在手里，他鳴咽地哭了………</p>
<h3>稚成叔</h3>
<p>— 陳跡</p>
<p>人類是在自己毀滅着自己呵！</p>
<p>已有半個年頭不見稚成叔了，我們時常在提起他。</p>
<p>「眞的，這個快樂的人兒不知道究竟到了哪兒去啦？」母親在邊洗菜，邊回過頭來給我們說話。</p>
<p>「可憐的流浪漢，一個光棍，他是沒有定居，說不定他是又去漂流了。」父親從嘴馬裏吐出淡巴瓜的濃烟來，我只能夠很糢然的看見他的象同情稚成叔的憂慮的面龐。</p>
<p>我們大家都沉默了。——在這沉默中，我想起了稚成叔那種爽豪的神態來。</p>
<p>記得是那麼一天吧，一個我們在過節的一天，他突然地在很早到了我們底家來。我們全家都歡迎他，尤其是我底媽媽。「啊！什么風吹你來的呀？」他嘩啦啦地笑了出來，他底笑聲簡直會把房子裏的窗玻璃也輕微地震動起來。他說話底聲音永遠是這麼嘩啦嘩啦的，他說：「什麼風嗎？嫂嫂！我來喝老酒的哩！」他又像瘋子似地笑了起來，並且從這狂笑聲中，我們可以聽見這斷斷續續的話聲：「你們……不會……拒……絕我……的嗎？……</p>
<p>於是他坐在我底旁邊，抱抱我底肩膀，對我說：「我底好少爺呀！不要這樣用心看書。我告訴你，我一個字也不識的，可是五年前，我是一個牛販子，在我底手中有過一萬塊錢。我這粗蠻的手臂，可以抱十個嫖子。你不要看我底臉黑得可怕，可是我底錢是雪亮雪白的呀，人們都把笑臉給我，我給他們肉吃，我給他們酒喝。……可是，我底好少爺呵！我是一個字兒也不識的！…」他又拍了拍我底肩膀。</p>
<p>於是他對我底父親講：「一百個人在我底手下吃飯，……」這是我們已聽上千遍了。我底母親正在殺鶏，那只大雄鶏竭力在掙扎，他底話題立刻轉變了，他走上去帮我底母親，一邊說：「我過去一下子殺掉三千雙鶏子哩。」我們都笑起來了，他並不聽了我們這種諷他說大話的笑聲而憤怒，只是加重着語氣說：「眞的哩，不是吹牛皮呀！」</p>
<p>就是那天，他喝了五斤酒，只有一點點的醉意。</p>
<p>我打着呵欠，伸着懶腰，有氣無力地說：「世界上或許是這種人最快樂吧？」忽然我底母親喊了起來，「說起曹操，曹操就到。稚成！我們正又在說到你了哩。」</p>
<p>我抬起我底頭來，只見稚成叔拖着一個黑灰灰的頭進來了，走進客堂，只深深地嘆了口氣，一屁股坐在一雙長凳上。用兩雙手掌把頭支撐着，眼睛直釘視着地板上的一些什麼，就什麼話也沒有說一句。——我們都對着他發驚了！</p>
<p>「稚成！什麼事這樣不快樂呵？」母親的聲音顯然有點兒發抖。我們底眼光全集中在他底身體上，我們是那麼熱切地在等着他底回答呵！</p>
<p>他又歎了口氣，抬起頭來，像很吃力似地，他舐了舐他底乾燥的雙唇，沒</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>精打彩地說：我吃了三個月的官司！」</p>
<p>「什麽？吃官司？為的什麽呵？」母親代我們那麽驚愕地問了。於是他吿訴我們，為了他太好心了，把一個朋友底一隻皮箱放在自己底房間裏，却不料那隻皮箱是那個朋友偸來的，他底朋友被捕了，他也因被搜出贓物而被補了。「是的！我會做賊的嗎？」可是他畢竟吃了三個月的官司！</p>
<p>他又歎氣了，他又沉默了！他好像一個影子那麽地坐在我底對面。</p>
<p>望着這悲哀的影子，我底心顫抖了！我底涙流下來了。</p>
<p>人類是在自己毀滅着自己呵！</p>
<h3>喚魂</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>「小虎子回家來，小虎子找媽來…」</p>
<p>凄凉的一個中年女人在深夜中連續的喊着，尾音幽幽的飄進夜風裏，帶着慘厲的哭聲。夜已很深了，她仍循着街一聲聲的喚着，整個的村莊是沉在寂靜的黝暗中，每一座籬笆門都閉了。夜，像死水般的寗靜，低壓下來的天，沒有月光，也沒有眨眼的星星，大氣中，間或只迥蕩着一陣陣荒凉的犬吠，與被風捲動的樹枝嚮。</p>
<p>這中年婦人手裏拖着一把長的掃帚，在黑影中深一步淺一步的移動着，走幾步，便抽噓般的喚兩聲待一息，回過頭來看看掃帚，在那一叢枯乾了的掃帚苗上，披着一件紅色的孩子的小衫，她疲乏得喘着氣，穿過一條街時，她累得立住了。仰起頭看看那深黑的天空，和街兩旁伏在蔭影下的房子一切都平靜的睡了，她噴了口怨氣，舉起左胳膊來用袖頭揩了下汗水，就又重振起精神喊着</p>
<p>「小虎子回家來，小虎子找媽來……」</p>
<p>她直瞪着眼向前方巡視，像那夜氣中有什麽東西引逗着她，艱難的又邁着步子，待拐過另一條街來，她推開緊閉着的自家那扇小柵欄門，拖着掃帚，（一片黃色的塵烟隨着掃帚飛散在夜氣裏）急匆匆的擦着地拉進屋去。</p>
<p>屋裏燃着一盞小小的豆油燈，皂君桌的香爐里，騰騰的環繞着烟圈，靠左邊的土　上，有一個十幾歲的孩子臥着，沉靜得沒一點聲息，嗆人的烟霧充塞着這狹小的房間，她把掃带拖到供桌跟前，便雙膝並立到一起，弓身跪了下去，伏着，額頭抵到泥地上，抬起頭又叩下去上身不停的起落，嘴里還低低的懸告着：</p>
<p>「皂王爺保佑我們虎子回來，我吃長齋，燒不斷頭香，皂王老爺發慈悲……」</p>
<p>她　告完，立起身來，把掃帚上的衣服輕輕拎起，一小步一小步的向坑邊移動着身子，一面嘟喂着：</p>
<p>「我媽來，，我媽來，別怕，皂王保佑着你，呵……」</p>
<p>走到　邊，把那件紅小衫給孩子披上，摸摸那微微有點呼吸的小嘴唇，便像眞一下得救了似的母親的愁苦的臉上顯出一絲笑意，她放下了心重爬下　來，走到院里去，把籬笆門關好，轉回屋里來，又新點上三株香，將燈心提得更大一些，照着那一點動靜也沒有的孩子，那黃瘦的臉和深陷下去的眼窩，她想：明天就能呌「媽媽」了，以後精心的扶侍幾天，自然就健壯起來。把燈臺往遠處推了推，睡下時一隻手撫摸着那茸茸的蓬鬆的頭髮，過後才閉上那在夜風中流過多少淚的眼睛，睡去了。</p>
<p>夜悠然的消逝了。灰色的曙光撲上窗　來，燈心吱吱的呌着，雄鷄淸朗的鳴在晨風里，這可憐的媽媽也從惡夢中醒了，她伸手去摸兒子的前額時，水樣的寒氣使她的手顫抖起來。她驚嚇的跪着重去試騐那瘦稜稜的鼻子，那微微掀起點來的小嘴，那兒一點氣息也沒有了，她漱漱的撒着淚滴，伏到那小小的挺直的屍體上，痛心的哭嚎起來。</p>
<p>她瘋狂了，粗野的伸出兩隻胳膊捧起那冰冷的頭顱來，呆呆的看着，過一陣，悲慘的呌着：</p>
<p>「我守了十一年寡，把你養大了，你也跟你爸爸一樣離開了我，我也去我……」</p>
<p>她抱着孩子的屍體，隨着那油燈的忽然熄滅，也昏迷了過去。</p>
<h3>娜拉（十九）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作圖　圻炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉見郝爾茂回到房裏去了，趕快低聲問：那事怎樣了？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：（低聲答）我同他說過了。</p>
<p>娜拉：是了，他——</p>
<p>林敦夫人：娜拉，你應該把這件事從頭到尾都吿訴你丈夫。</p>
<p>娜拉：（有意無意地）我知道。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：你不必怕柯樂克。但是你必須耍對你丈夭說老實話。</p>
<p>娜拉：我不吿訴他便怎樣？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：那麽，那封信會吿訴。</p>
<p>娜拉：姬婷，多謝你，現在我有法子了，不要聲張！</p>

<p>蔡筱舫毛家書</p>
<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「張桓侯」</p>
<p>性如烈火猛桓侯。義結桃園意氣投。開旗勦滅黃巾黨。安喜會經鞭督郵。虎牢關閉誰能破。殺得，斷髮穿冠呂布羞。威風壓倒衆諸侯。弟兄散後難相見。只為，兵徵將寡陷徐州。一個兒，義不降曹先盟誓。單刀圍困土山頭。一個兒。迢迢朝北依袁紹。一個兒，古城中，兵馬錢糧一鼓收。古城相會明心跡。釋疑心幸斬蔡陽頭。曹兵百萬當陽道。一聲虎嘯挺蛇矛。長板橋邊水逆流。義釋嚴顏會士。蜀道崎嶇反掌收。足智軍師還遜一籌。瓦口前寨終日醉。忽然粗莽將軍有智謀。智欺張邵定中州。葭萌關外開旗鼓。並舉雙槍神鬼憂。殺得斗轉星移兵未收。久鎭閬中誰敢犯。生半恨未報兄仇。鞭撻健兒重使喚。范疆張達刺咽喉。將軍若緩須臾死。何懼山河不屬劉。豈至於，秋草長遺滿地愁。</p>
<p>徐文璧開篇</p>
<p>航業（一一八○）十一時一刻至十二時　　開篇「沈鳳喜被辱」</p>
<p>辜負了，舊日的情人說阮劉。居然夫婿覓封侯。問心口自難言應。悔不該，別抱琵琶結鳳儔。但是，敗柳殘花君莫問。只因為，前生緣福未全修。此番舊地重相會。我豈甘，把往日交情一筆鈎。我想你，世上儘多紅粉女。一樣是，調琴鼓瑟占溫柔。不比我，道旁苦李人攀折。一任狂風雨打頭。只聽君言原諒我。相隨同伴到杭州。但是，將軍權力無邊大。不別而行怎了休。縱使一時能匿跡。惟恐怕，天涯地角也難投。故而我，一時聽說難言答。不覺得，紅暈桃花滿面羞。就把那，支票一張圖欲報。數成加倍為君酬。豈知他，撕來片片成蝴蝶。飛上雲霄去不留。故而，坐上洋車歸路去。心中鬱鬱只擔憂。</p>

<h3>章將軍的平等</h3>
<p>第一號攝影場上，在拍　到自然去將軍府的大廳。</p>
<p>將軍是主張平等的，他在這大廳裏舉行着一種平等茶話會。</p>
<p>這位將軍很有趣，他所主張的平等，原就是階級的破除。但這還不是永久的，只能在他所舉行的這平等茶話會上，據說每月一次。</p>
<p>無論男僕，婢女，廚師，花匠，差弁，賬房的先生，以至趕馬車的車夫。在這茶話會上都要被視為上賓。將軍的三位養尊處優的小姐（黎莉莉，龔智華，徐佛分飾）平日一呼百諾，吃飯就短用人喂，而在這平等茶話會上她們却須要送茶點烟的伺候婢女和車夫這一干人。稍一慢待，將軍還不客氣的大加申斥。你說這是多麽有趣的事。</p>
<p>孫瑜的導演手法向是輕鬆幽默默得可愛，這塲戲在他處理之下，如果說它不能使觀衆把眼淚都笑出來，誰也不相信。</p>

<p>吳漢兄定明天下午六時在會賓樓請客，據說是為了明星半月刋特大號的事情。</p>
<p>記得「明星」特大號徵稿信上有「獎掖電影」的謬獎，而現在又有請客帖子給我。又記得某導演（稱為某導演者，蓋避免父有「帮篤」的嫌疑也。）曾經說是他的作品沒有好評潮湧，完全是因為做「砲架子」的緣故。現在這樣一來，却使我不懂了。</p>
<p>報載：袁美雲為「皂后」及「東宮」「西宮」加冕。未知「革命同志」參與盛典否？</p>
<p>電通多半是復活無望了，據某種人說來，自然這又是孫師毅的罪狀之一，不然，何以早不關遲不關，在指了些「街頭巷尾」之後纔關呢</p>
<p>陳大悲在看「桃花太子」的時候，對人說，這樣的東西黎錦暉不知怎樣編出來的？」言下大有缺乏「美麗的意識」之感。</p>
<h3>瑪琳黛德麗新作　「欲望」卽將公映</h3>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗和加萊古柏，自「摩洛哥」一片後，即沒有合作過，現在，他們第二度聯合主演的作品「欲望Desire，聞不日將在大光明公映，這確是一個値得注意的消息。該片不但由大導演家鮑才祺導演，並由劉別謙親任監製，其成績之美好，自屬意中事，派拉蒙公司把它列入本年度鉅片之一，確非無因，這是一個富有詼諧的羅曼絲，頗多滑稽的穿挿和雋永的對白，瑪琳黛德麗在這部片子裏面的作風，稍有變更，但她那帶有神秘意味的熱烈表情，是仍舊存在的。</p>

<h3>Japan's Diplomacy Towards China: No Change in Overall Policy; So-Called Non-Adherence to the Three Principles is a Piecemeal Approach to Avoid Backlash; Common Anti-Communism as the Primary Goal</h3>
<p>Matsumuro to Assume Post as Head of Special Service Agency in Peiping</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to an observation by a certain diplomat, Arita's so-called "non-adherence to the Three Principles" emphasizes the point of common anti-communism. In reality, it is to separate the manner of proposing the Three Principles into several parts, avoiding the simultaneous application of all three, which could create a change in diplomacy and provoke a backlash. It is possible that there may be changes in the active and independent diplomatic approach that was a deviation from the Hirota cooperative diplomacy, but the overall policy remains unchanged. We should not assume that Arita's phrase "non-adherence" signifies a possible softening of Japan's China policy. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Foreign Minister Arita expressed his opinion that the Three Principles should not be adhered to in China policy, the Chinese government misunderstood its meaning, believing that "Japan, due to its adherence to the Three Principles, is at a disadvantage in Sino-Japanese relations, and may withdraw them." As a result, various speculations were expressed. However, according to Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations should be based on the Three Principles. This was stated by former Foreign Minister Hirota in a parliamentary speech, and also conveyed to the Chinese government by former Ambassador Arima. Foreign Minister Arita will naturally inherit the foreign policy of the previous cabinet. Therefore, the Three Principles remain the basis for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. (3rd Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, who took office yesterday, told reporters regarding future foreign policy: "Japan's foreign policy is clearly stated in the Imperial Rescript upon withdrawal from the League of Nations. We will do our utmost to implement it. That is sufficient. Regarding the complex issue of relations with China, which are the deepest, and relations with the Soviet Union, it is essential to resolve them promptly in accordance with the spirit of the Rescript. However, the most urgent task is to save East Asia from the danger of communism and establish peace in East Asia." (5th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japanese military attaché Imai told foreign journalists that the Japanese troops stationed in North China might depart for Japan within this month. As for the number of new troops replacing them, he did not know. However, he expects the number to be the same as the current troop strength. When asked about the current number of Japanese troops in North China, Imai replied that it was a military secret and he was not at liberty to say. Rumors circulating outside claim that the number of new defense forces would increase, with some saying one division and others saying three divisions, but all are groundless rumors. Even he himself does not know the exact number. He believes that there is no need to publicly announce the number of troops stationed. Matsumuro will arrive in Peiping tomorrow afternoon to take over the duties left by Doihara. However, Matsumuro will be subordinate to the Japanese troops stationed in North China, not the Kwantung Army. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Special Service Agency Chief Takeshita flew to Changchun by plane on the 4th to meet with Commander-in-Chief Ueda of the Kwantung Army and attended a staff meeting of the Kwantung Army convened this morning by Chiefs of Staff Itagaki and Imamura. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese aircraft No. 140 flew from Gubeikou to Tianjin on the morning of the 5th and landed at the Dongjuzi airfield. Shortly afterwards, two Japanese soldiers boarded and flew northwest. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The advance team of forty soldiers from the 5th Division of the Japanese Army arrived from Japan on the 5th, passing through Tianjin without stopping and heading to Peiping. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsumuro is scheduled to advance his departure to Peiping to the morning of the 6th to assume the post of Chief of the Special Service Agency of the Japanese Army stationed in North China. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Qin Dechun stated that there were no changes in the diplomatic situation in Hebei-Chahar. Reports that Song is going to Shandong are inaccurate. I will not be leaving Peiping for the time being. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Qin Dechun told reporters that the date for Chairman Song's return to Peiping has not been set. Reports that Song is going to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu are inaccurate. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tax Police in Southern Hebei Clash with Villagers</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 3rd, the 81st squad of the tax police in Quzhou County, Southern Hebei, clashed with dozens of villagers in Longtang and other villages. More than 600 people gathered and confiscated the firearms of the tax police. Jiang Qi, the 8th District Chief of the tax police, has rushed to investigate. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Newly Organized Bandit Group in Chahar Border Area Completed Reorganization Under Surveillance of Large Troops</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly organized bandit group Wang Dao in Yongan Fort, Yanqing, Chahar Border Area, was recently reorganized by the Chahar authorities under the surveillance of large troops dispatched by the Security General Corps.

<h3>Each Agency Creates a Transcendent Accounting System</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan Amends Organizational Articles</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Legislative and Financial Committees, adhering to the central government's principles for establishing a transcendent accounting system, and following the precedent of establishing an accounting office in the amended Organization Law of the Ministry of Finance, have added articles to the organization laws of all central agencies to uniformly establish accounting personnel. The establishment standards are divided into three categories: those with more income and expenditure will establish an accounting chief, such as the Ministry of Railways, Communications, Military Affairs, and Navy; those with relatively moderate income and expenditure will establish an accounting director, which applies to the most agencies, such as the Five Yuan and the Ministry of Interior and Industry; and those with less income and expenditure will establish an accountant, such as the Supervisory Envoy's Office and the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee. In addition, statistical personnel in central agencies will also be divided into three categories according to the complexity of their tasks: statistical chief, statistical director, and statistician. All the above-mentioned accounting and statistical personnel will be appointed and dismissed by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and will be directly responsible to the Directorate-General, but will be subject to the command and supervision of the主管長官. This case can be submitted to the Yuan's general meeting for approval within two weeks, and is expected to be implemented starting in 1936. In the future, it will not only open a new era in China's administrative organization, but also promote the transcendent accounting system throughout the country.

<h3>Germany's Diplomatic Tactics After Abandoning the Treaty</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>It has been exactly one month since Hitler abandoned the Treaty of Locarno on the 7th of last month and marched troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. We will not discuss here the tense situation in Europe caused by Germany's actions over the past month, but only make a brief analysis of the diplomatic tactics used by Germany in this month. Understanding these diplomatic tactics will not only help us to easily understand the recent developments in Europe, but also provide important reference for China, a "weak country with no diplomacy," in the application of future diplomatic policies.</p>
<p>There are three types of diplomatic tactics adopted by Germany after abandoning the treaty. First, it exploits the internal contradictions among imperialist countries such as Britain, France, and Italy. Second, it exploits the conflict between the British Empire and the socialist Soviet Union. Third, it creates popular sentiment to support a tough diplomatic stance. These will be discussed separately below.</p>
<p>The interests of imperialist countries are inherently irreconcilable. Currently, the interests of countries such as Britain, France, and Italy are in conflict with each other. The conflict between Italy and Britain caused by the Abyssinian War is very serious. Even the friendly relations of the Franco-Italian Rome Accords were shaken by France's compliance with the League of Nations' resolution to sanction Italy. The interests of Britain and France are not entirely consistent, especially in their relations with Germany, because Britain's European diplomacy has always adopted a policy of balance of power, and the tendency to suppress France and elevate Germany after the war was based on this. Since the interests of the signatories to the Locarno Treaty are inconsistent, Hitler was able to exploit this to achieve its goal of abandoning the treaty. On the one hand, he wooed Mussolini, who was sanctioned by the League of Nations, so that he would not fulfill his obligations under the Locarno Treaty. At the same time, he catered to the British Conservative government, making it an important mediator in the Franco-German dispute and not strictly enforcing the provisions of the Locarno Treaty. Hitler wooed Britain by using the anti-Soviet slogan mentioned below, and by proposing peace proposals at the same time as abandoning the treaty, because Britain advocates peaceful negotiations and does not want to see France adopt a high-pressure policy towards Germany. When announcing the abandonment of the treaty on March 7, Hitler proposed six points as the basis for international peace negotiations. Although Eden criticized Germany's unilateral abandonment of the treaty in a speech to the House of Commons on March 9, he expressed his willingness to thoroughly study Hitler's new proposals. In the London Conference, Britain strongly advocated inviting German representatives to attend, and the second part of the Locarno Four-Power Agreement on March 19 was entirely drafted to accommodate Hitler's proposals. Later, Eden repeatedly delivered speeches hoping that Germany would make a contribution. Hitler's contribution was published on April 1. In addition to insisting on the established facts it had created, it also put forward nineteen vague and far-reaching peace proposals. Hitler's true intention was to use the different interests of Britain and France to alienate the opinions of the two countries, to set aside the established facts and discuss international peace issues separately. This diplomatic tactic of exploiting the internal conflicts of imperialist countries has now achieved great success, because Britain's attitude has focused on the discussion of peace proposals.</p>
<p>Secondly, imperialist countries are fundamentally opposed to socialist countries. Britain under the rule of the Conservative Party is an important element in the anti-Soviet movement, and Hitler has always taken the lead in opposing the Soviet Union. The excuse for abandoning the treaty was that the approval of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact not only violated the original anti-Soviet spirit of the Locarno Treaty, but also threatened to make all of Europe communist. This statement hit the Conservative government "where it hurts." Britain's adoption of a mediating attitude toward the Franco-German dispute is also a factor.</p>
<p>Thirdly, creating popular sentiment to support diplomacy has always been an important diplomatic tactic of Hitler. When Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference in 1933, Hitler held a referendum to show that its diplomatic policy was supported by the majority of the people. When announcing the abandonment of the treaty, it was natural to use this old tactic again. The results of the brown election on March 29 showed that Hitler had achieved a great victory. Therefore, Hitler could say to Britain and France that its diplomatic policy had been supported by the people of the whole country and could not be compromised. This was clearly pointed out in the reply on April 1.</p>
<p>Regardless of the true meaning of Hitler's abandonment of the treaty, the diplomatic tactics it has used have obviously achieved great success in terms of the current European situation. Looking back at our country, which is in deep trouble and whose territory is shrinking day by day, how to use the internal contradictions among imperialist countries in diplomacy to seek true friends, and how to encourage popular sentiment to support diplomacy, is a problem that our authorities and the public must urgently consider and solve.</p>

<h3>Hungarian General Seeks Equality Rights, Unwilling to Conclude Mutual Treaties with Neighboring Countries. Austrian Foreign Minister States Purpose of Implementing Conscription System Is to Maintain Independence, Ultimately Becoming an International Obligation.</h3>
<p>The political circles in the Hungarian capital have recently declared that since Germany has abolished the military clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles and Austria has restored conscription, Hungary should unconditionally enjoy full and equal rights. Regarding this matter, Hungary does not want to imitate Germany and Austria and unilaterally abolish existing treaties, but the countries concerned should grant Hungary full freedom of rights in the shortest possible time. Hungary is unwilling to conclude mutual assistance treaties with its neighboring countries. The government newspaper "Hungarian Capital Labor News" also published a commentary, stating, "When and in what form the Hungarian government will demand equal rights has not yet been decided, but once this demand is made, it must be satisfied without reservation or condition." It is generally believed that this article was written with official authorization. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Austrian Foreign Minister Weidigger gave a speech yesterday to the Vienna correspondent of a hardline newspaper in this city, explaining the country's recently adopted labor service and military service law. He said, "The existing treaties do not prohibit the people from serving the country. Bulgaria has already implemented a people's service system. What Austria has done is purely a matter of internal affairs, which does not violate existing treaties or international obligations. This matter has been planned for a long time, and now that the time is right, we have taken a resolute action that does not violate the treaties." As for the meeting held by the authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome last month, no secret resolutions were passed. The labor service and military service law recently decided by Austria is not related to that meeting. "The purpose of this meeting was to mutually integrate the policies adopted by Italy, Austria, and Hungary regarding the Danube River region, in the most appropriate form that can be recognized by other countries. The three countries will continue to liaise constantly in the future to integrate this policy at any time." Weidigger then said that the Austrian labor service and military service law is different from the usual compulsory conscription system. "This law stipulates the obligations that men should fulfill to the country, and it may be applied to women in the future. In short, the country has the right to stipulate the intellectual, physical, including military or non-military obligations that citizens should fulfill to the country. We believe that since citizens are nourished by the country, they should bear corresponding obligations to the country." Moreover, after the implementation of this new law, the existing military training organizations will not be dissolved. "Because the labor service and military service system is not related to military training, our purpose is not only to maintain Austria's independence, but also to help its development. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a labor service and military service system so that it can complete international obligations with greater strength. This aspiration has been held for a long time, and now it is leaving theory and entering into practice, so that Austria can obtain the necessary strength to preserve its position in Europe." Weidigger also said that the Austrian army originally adopted a recruitment system, which required a large amount of funding. In the future, it should be replaced by a compulsory conscription system. "We can use this to enrich the strength of the army. This army is still defensive in nature, but its strength must be able to resist all acts of aggression." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Southern Country Diplomatic Talks, Opinions Tend to Be Consistent</h3>

Afterwards, he also gave a speech, saying, "Turkey and South Korea have the same opinions, and this resolution is confirmed by the talks." He also said that Bulgaria did not inform neighboring countries in advance of the military clauses of the Treaty of Neuilly, and will not abolish them suddenly. (Note: The Treaty of Neuilly was signed by the former Entente powers with Bulgaria on November 27, 1919, stipulating that the Bulgarian army should not exceed 25,000 officers and soldiers, all warships should be dismantled, and the establishment of an air force was not allowed.) Rüştü left here at 7:40 this morning and returned to the Turkish capital. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Counter-proposal to Germany's Proposal, France Drafts New Peace Plan, Promotes Collective Security System within the League of Nations Structure, Based on Briand's Proposal to Build the United States of Europe</h3>
<p>(Paris) An Associated Press reporter learned today from influential sources that France will present a broad European peace plan at the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty. If this plan cannot be passed, France intends to form an alliance with several countries so that it can have sufficient strength to cope with Germany's attacks. According to informed sources, France's plan even intends to build a "United States of Europe." This is the proposal of the late Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Briand in his later years, wanting Europe to implement new political and economic facilities and abolish tariff barriers between countries. Its central idea is to eliminate the attitude of opposition and competition among European countries and cooperate with each other. It is reported that the United Kingdom has accepted France's request in principle and agreed to hold a meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty within one week after Easter. French Foreign Minister Flandin consulted with experts all day today to draft France's proposal, and the cabinet may approve it when it meets on Monday. It can be issued the next day. Germany will also send a copy, which will be forwarded by the British government. (National Electricity on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) France's reply to the German memorandum is heard to contain a new peace plan within the League of Nations structure, based on mutual assistance, the limitation and reduction of armaments, and the general principles of collective security, and will contain a suggestion that members of the League of Nations each contribute special troops to maintain the alliance and supervise implementation. France advocates that major countries each contribute four divisions of mechanized standing troops, and small countries each contribute one division. The new plan has actually been drafted, and after being approved by the cabinet tomorrow, it will be sent to the governments of the United Kingdom, Italy, and Belgium and the League of Nations in the form of a note. According to popular speculation, the reply will criticize Germany's claim that France violated President Wilson's fourteen points, and insist that the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement is compatible with the Locarno Treaty, and will announce that France will not allow its eastern border to have German defensive works.

<h3>Signatory Countries of Locarno to Convene Second Meeting</h3>

(Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the location of the second meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, Foreign Secretary Eden proposed that it be moved from Brussels to Geneva. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently explained that Foreign Secretary Eden's intention was that the representatives of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact could take advantage of the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Executive Council to hold informal talks in Geneva, which would be sufficient. It is not necessary to formally convene a meeting, which would avoid sensationalism, and the British Parliament would not raise questions. The Foreign Secretary would not have to issue a formal declaration. If this method is accepted by France, the Foreign Secretary will leave for Geneva on Tuesday, and will then go to the French Riviera to spend Easter. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Eden Mediates to Promote French-German Compromise</h3>
<p>Germany Rejects Demilitarization of the Rhineland; Anglo-German Talks Do Not Involve Colonial Issues</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden previously requested German representative Ribbentrop to refrain from constructing fortifications in the Rhineland, which Germany has already rejected. Political figures explain that the Foreign Secretary's request only applies to the "transitional period," that is, the period related to the initial negotiations among various countries. Although Germany seems to have firmly rejected the request, the Foreign Secretary will still try to persuade them to compromise. Ribbentrop will stay in London for several more days, while other members of the delegation, such as the Director of the Political Department of the German Foreign Ministry, Mr. Dieckhoff, have already flown back to their country. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>Portugal's Stance on the Current European Situation</h3>
<p>The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Monteiro, recently gave an interview to the press in the capital, Lisbon, to explain Portugal's views on major international issues. He said, "There are those who advocate convening large-scale international conferences with broad objectives. This approach has been tried and tested, and the results have been very limited. Some may think it is still worth trying again, but a more practical approach is to discuss the various outstanding issues separately in meetings, with the participation of the countries directly involved, and without the unnecessary involvement of other countries." As for Europe, the pacifism advocated by some idealists can cause disturbances and civil wars in other countries. European countries should prevent such cunning tricks. "In short, peace should be viewed as a whole, without being restricted by space or time. Temporary peace is by no means equivalent to lasting peace." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Fascist Youth Organization</h3>
<p>50,000 Members Gather in the Square; Italian Prime Minister Encourages Loyalty to the Country</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Fascist Youth Organization was founded on April 4, 1926. All young men and women aged eight to eighteen are required to join. It currently has more than five million members. Today marks the tenth anniversary of its founding. 50,000 members of the organization gathered in Venice Square to hold a commemorative ceremony. The participants included bicycle teams, motorcycle teams, rifle teams, and gas mask teams, all standing in neat and solemn rows. Facing the square was Venice Palace, the location of the Prime Minister's Office. Suddenly, Prime Minister Mussolini appeared on the balcony, and military music began to play loudly. 50,000 members shouted "Our leader! Our leader!" The voices were impassioned and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Mussolini then addressed the members, saying, "Today is the day when the resistance of the people of Abyssinia has been completely eliminated. The Italian army has completed this outstanding task today! Precursors of the Youth Organization! Your voices are full of vitality and reach my heart! Your fathers and brothers are now fighting with their supreme courage on the battlefield, and victory is in their grasp. This is like a thunderbolt to the enemy, and they have nowhere to escape! In the future, when the country needs you and calls upon you to engage in the struggle, everything will depend on your strength and your heart. You should prepare in time. If you can do this, you will be worthy of the black shirt of honor, and you can serve the country from beginning to end without shame!" (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia's Elite Troops No Longer Combat-Ready; Fate of the East African War Decided; Generals' Disobedience Led to Great Mistakes; Italian Troops in the North Occupy Important Towns</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to Italian newspapers, news from Djibouti stated that after the Abyssinian Emperor's defeat at Lake Ashangi, he sent a telegram to his wife saying, "Besides praying for me, there is nothing else you can do." The Emperor's elite troops of 40,000 fought fiercely for four days but were defeated by the Italian army. They are reportedly no longer combat-ready and have become a disorganized mass. The Italian army believes that its recent victory has destroyed the last military obstacle and that it can now completely occupy Abyssinia. The Italian army is still in pursuit. It is reported that they have not only reached the shores of Lake Tana but are also closely following the retreating troops and heading straight for the town of Quoram. After occupying this town, the Italian army can control two important roads, one leading to Dessie and the other to the Danakil region. According to the road to Dessie, the Italian army can now advance along the flat terrain. A military commissioner watching the war alongside the Italian army told a Reuters correspondent stationed in Asmara by telephone today that the Abyssinian Emperor's defeat at Lake Ashangi was due to the disobedience of his generals. The Emperor ordered his generals to stick to scattered combat tactics, but the generals did not heed his words and did not withdraw their troops, engaging the Italian army in close combat, which led to their defeat. From now on, the Emperor's fate is almost hopeless. The Abyssinian army had already made this mistake in places like Dambian, and now they have made this great mistake again. The outcome is now determined. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news received here today, Italian columns that occupied Gondar and then converged are advancing. Their right flank has now reached the shores of Lake Tana. According to a telegram from General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, the great battle of Lake Tana ended yesterday morning. The troops under the command of Abyssinian General Negus were defeated and fled south. All Italian aircraft were deployed to bombard the defeated enemy troops with bombs and machine guns. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Asmara: According to a special correspondent from our agency, since the Abyssinian Imperial Guard suffered a major defeat near Lake Ashangi in the north, there have been widespread rumors of political turmoil in the Abyssinian capital. A telegram has been urgently sent to the Emperor, asking him to return to the capital from the front lines to take charge. The gates of the Abyssinian capital are now wide open, and it would not be difficult for the Italian army to drive straight in. However, the rugged roads will cause difficulties for the Italian army. The internal chaos of the Abyssinian army on the front lines is extreme. Every time they engage the Italian army, they suffer defeats. The total losses far exceed the number of Italian casualties. For example, in a certain battle where the Italian army engaged the troops directly commanded by the Abyssinian Emperor, the Abyssinian army suffered thousands of casualties, while the Italian army only had one officer and five soldiers killed, and twenty-one officers and soldiers wounded. Here is an account of the recent battle of Lake Ashangi: At 6:30 AM on April 3rd, the Italian army began its attack, with the 1st Mountain Division and the Sabada Division of the 1st Army jointly attacking the Abyssinian positions at Hesu Taiba. At the same time, the Italian Eritrean 1st Army detoured to encircle the Abyssinian army's rear. By the evening, the Mountain Division had reached Mount Adia Segerti, and the Sabada Division, after strong resistance from the Abyssinian army, finally occupied the area of Agon Belda. The Italian army then deployed heavy artillery at the Meco Pass to bombard the enemy, killing thousands of enemy soldiers. The enemy troops were panicked and fled south. At the same time, Italian planes circled in the sky, pursuing and attacking, which made the Abyssinian army even more terrified. The next morning, the Italian army continued to advance by detouring to the Guaran area on the east side of Lake Ashangi. The Abyssinian army fled in disarray. As for the Abyssinian Emperor himself, he led the remnants of the Imperial Guard and retreated to a more distant area in the south. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to a reporter from our agency, O'Sheena, three Italian planes bombed the city of Jijiga in the southern province of Ogaden this morning and flew over the nearby cities of Harar and Dire Dawa. The residents of these places were able to remain calm, and some have already left the city for other destinations. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Asmara: According to a special correspondent from our agency, another fierce battle broke out near Lake Ashangi in northern Abyssinia yesterday. In this battle, the last Abyssinian army, the Imperial Guard, personally commanded by the Emperor, was completely defeated by the Italian army. The remnants were pursued by Italian planes and have all fled south. At the same time, a communique issued by General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Expeditionary Force, stated that the battle of Lake Ashangi has now ended, and the Abyssinian army is fleeing south in a "state of demoralization and despair." The disorganized remnants are in disarray, and all Italian planes are now bombing them. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian Planes Attack Addis Ababa; Abyssinia Protests to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Accuses the Action of Violating the Hague Convention; People are Panicked and Foreigners are Relocating</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has protested to the League of Nations about the Italian air attack on Addis Ababa yesterday, saying that the Italian planes' action violated the Hague Convention prohibiting the bombing of undefended towns. According to Abyssinian semi-official sources, the Italian government first telegraphed General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, and Graziani, Commander of the Italian forces on the southern front, saying that they could decide for themselves whether or not to bomb the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway, without seeking permission from the government. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Since the Italian air raid this morning, the people of Addis Ababa have been in a state of panic. It is expected that a large number of enemy planes will soon arrive again to carry out a large-scale bombing. Therefore, the general population is currently busy packing their luggage and transporting it to the countryside by camel caravan to seek refuge. The damage caused by the initial Italian bombing seems to be less than expected. Only two airports and one of the Emperor's private planes were destroyed. In the urban area, only a small number of houses were damaged by the shock waves, and the rest were mostly undamaged. Three residents were slightly injured and were taken to the hospital for treatment. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The diplomatic corps held a meeting and decided that if the overall situation worsens, all foreigners in the area should take refuge inside the British Embassy. At the same time, residents, fearing another Italian air raid, are fleeing to the surrounding forests outside the city. All stored gasoline has been moved, and railway authorities now believe that the bridge over the Awash River on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway will be bombed by Italian planes in the near future.

<h3>Contents of the French Proposal</h3>
<p>(Paris) The diplomatic correspondent of *Le Petit Parisien*, Bourges, recently stated that the French government's proposed counter-proposal to the German memorandum will be based on collective security and will draft a construction plan for the European situation in order to promote a system of mutual assistance. Its contents will strictly specify the implementation measures for certain clauses of the League of Nations Covenant. Regional pacts should be established in Eastern Europe, the Danube region, and the Mediterranean coast, with a nature similar to the Locarno Pact. In other words, the French counter-proposal is based on the 1924 Geneva Protocol and the "European Union" plan proposed by former French Foreign Minister Briand in 1929. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin is currently drafting a document to reply to the German memorandum with his staff. Official sources are unwilling to disclose the main contents of this document. However, according to our reporter's investigation, the French reply is roughly divided into two parts besides the preamble.</p>
<p>The preamble refutes the German memorandum's interpretation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact. (Germany claimed that the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland was inconsistent with President Wilson's Fourteen Points, and that the basis for it was that the Allied Powers themselves broke the guarantees they had made to Germany. As for the Locarno Pact, it was concluded after the French occupation of the Ruhr region, and the guarantees to Germany were once again broken.)</p>
<p>The first part states that the proposal made by the signatories of the Locarno Pact on March 19th, aimed at restoring the international rule of law in the Rhineland, has now been rejected by Germany. Therefore, the guarantee measures stipulated in the letter sent by Britain to France and Belgium on April 1st should be implemented. In France's view, Germany's refusal to show a spirit of compromise means that the Locarno Pact system cannot be restored to its original state, even symbolically. Therefore, Germany's proposal, compared to the draft Locarno Agreement, is passive in nature and does not help in practice. However, since Britain is willing to continue negotiations, France should satisfy this.</p>
<p>The second part explains the French peace plan for Europe one by one. This plan will be submitted to the Executive Council of the League of Nations for discussion. In general, France will insist that Germany must not build fortifications in the Rhineland. Regarding this point, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that if Germany builds fortifications in the Rhineland, it can station only a small number of troops along the Rhine River when it launches an aggression against Eastern European countries, without worrying about the West. At that time, even if Britain and France want to intervene under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, they will be powerless. If so, the collective security system will inevitably collapse. In addition, France believes that Germany's proposal to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts is not in line with a true collective security system based on mutual assistance. France may re-propose the 1924 Geneva Protocol to make Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, which concerns sanctions, more effective. (Note: The Geneva Protocol was adopted by the Fifth General Assembly of the League of Nations on October 1, 1924, stipulating economic and financial sanctions against aggressor states and assistance to victim states.)

<h3>Committee of Thirteen to Convene on Wednesday to Discuss Italian-Abyssinian Peace</h3>
<p>Italian-French Contact on the Opening Procedure</p>
<p>(Paris) The Committee of Thirteen of the Executive Council of the League of Nations has been convened by its chairman, Madariaga, to meet in Geneva on the 8th of this month. The Italian Ambassador, Cerruti, paid a visit to Foreign Minister Flandin this morning. It is said that the two discussed the procedural issues of the Committee's meeting. Cerruti explained the Italian view, saying that the peace between Italy and Abyssinia should be directly negotiated by the two countries involved, and that the League of Nations' participation in the matter is only to facilitate the two countries to approach each other. He also said that the Italian government hopes that the Chairman of the Committee, Madariaga, can travel to Rome before the meeting to discuss everything with Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Committee of Thirteen of the Executive Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet on the 8th of this month and listen to the report of Chairman Madariaga on his contacts with the representatives of the two countries involved, Italy and Abyssinia. This report was submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, for review last night. Its full text is not very long and includes four documents of correspondence between Madariaga and the Italian government. The first letter is Madariaga's invitation to the Italian government to send representatives to attend the Committee of Thirteen. The second letter is the Italian government's reply agreeing to do so. The third letter is Madariaga's inquiry to the Italian government as to whether its troops will use poison gas. The fourth letter is the reply submitted by the Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich on April 3rd, stating that this issue is not within the scope of the Committee of Thirteen's authority and questioning the Committee as to whether the Italian government's previous protest regarding the Abyssinian army's combat methods has been conveyed to the Abyssinian government.

<h3>Italy Resists Sanctions by Promoting the Use of Petroleum Substitutes</h3>
<p>Brescia, Italy: Although the League of Nations' proposal to impose an oil embargo on Italy has not been realized, many cars in Italy have been converted to use alcohol instead of gasoline to power their engines in order to reduce gasoline imports and achieve the practical effect of resisting sanctions. A 1,000-mile long-distance car race was held here starting at 5:00 AM this morning. It was started by the Deputy Secretary of the Pan-Fascist Party, Serena. Prime Minister Mussolini's own car, powered by alcohol, also participated in the race. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Part of the British Fleet Stationed in the Mediterranean Withdrawn; Anglo-Italian Relations Show Signs of Easing</h3>
<p>(London) According to our reporter's investigation, a portion of the British fleet in the Mediterranean has recently been transferred back to the country, with a total tonnage of 87,000 tons. The total tonnage of warships remaining stationed has been reduced to 560,000 tons. Naval experts have concluded from this that Anglo-Italian relations in the Mediterranean, at least for the time being, are unlikely to become tense. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Build Powerful Radio Stations for Radio Warfare Against China; Power of 150 Kilowatts</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During the Manchurian Incident and the Shanghai Incident, the Chinese government used its powerful 75-kilowatt radio station to broadcast news, causing great suffering to Japan. The Chinese government has recently purchased radio equipment from the German company Siemens and plans to set up 50-kilowatt broadcasting stations in Guangdong and 10-kilowatt stations in Guangxi, preparing to implement powerful international broadcasting. However, the maximum power of radio stations in Tokyo and other parts of Japan is only 10 kilowatts. In view of this fact, the Ministry of Communications is currently rushing to build a large 150-kilowatt radio station in Chiba Prefecture and has also decided to build 150-kilowatt radio stations in Osaka and Kyushu to implement powerful international radio broadcasting.

<h3>Japanese Telegram Reports Again: Russian Planes Cross Border for Reconnaissance; Puppet Organization Prepares to Protest</h3>
<p>(Harbin) At a time when the Russian-Manchurian border is fraught with incidents, Soviet military aircraft have recently crossed the border, irritating the nerves of the "Manchukuo" government. On the morning of the 2nd, a Russian plane crossed the border, flying over Mishan Mulinzi at a height of 600 meters, reaching a point 1,000 meters from Banzai River. It was shot at by the Japanese surveillance team before flying back towards Russian territory. Then, at 10:30 AM on the 3rd, a Soviet Russian Type 93 heavy bomber flew over from the east of Heihe, crossing the border at a height of 800 meters, penetrating deep into Manchurian territory to reconnoiter the situation before leisurely flying north. (Domei, 5th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 3rd, a Soviet Russian plane flew over Pokranikinaia. Recently, there have been frequent incidents of Soviet Russian planes crossing the border. On the morning of the 2nd, at 10:00 AM, a Soviet Russian plane invaded Mishan County, strafing a Japanese military surveillance post from the sky with machine guns. At 10:30 AM on the 3rd, a Soviet Russian bomber again crossed the border. Due to the recent frequent intrusions of Russian planes into Manchurian territory, a serious protest will soon be lodged with Russia. (Den-tsu, 5th)</p>
<h3>Buryat Mongols Resolve to Aid Outer Mongolia; Concentrate Forces to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Harbin: According to news from Moscow, the Buryat "Mongolian Republic," in view of the increasingly tense situation on the puppet Mongolian border, recently wrote to Stalin expressing its determination to concentrate the nation's strength and stand on the same front as the various socialist nationalities of the Soviet Union, giving their common enemy, the Japanese aggressors, a fierce blow. The Buryat Mongols are located south of Lake Baikal, with their capital at Ulan-Ude. They have an area of 800,000 square miles and a population of 900,000.

<h3>Rumors that the Young King of Siam Will Be Asked to Abdicate</h3>
<p>Due to Connections with Other Religions; At Least He Must Live Separately from His Mother</p>
<p>(Singapore) The Bangkok newspaper *Prajakorn* revealed today that the ten-year-old young king of Siam may be asked to abdicate because he is said to have been influenced by Christianity. The Queen Mother, who is currently living with the young king in France, is said to have become a Christian. If the young king does not abdicate, he will at least live separately from his mother. Siam is a devoutly Buddhist country, so the news that the young king has connections with other religions has caused great shock. The young king has been studying in Europe since he ascended the throne and has not yet returned to the country to be crowned. (Guo Wu, 5th)</p>
<h3>Spain to Send Envoy to Russian Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid: Since Spain recognized Soviet Russia in July 1933, it has not sent a diplomatic representative. It is now believed that the government intends to send an envoy to Moscow immediately. In addition, Spanish diplomatic personnel stationed in Britain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, and the Holy See will also undergo major changes. The plan is currently being drafted. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Mrs. Mollison's Aviation Feat Suffers a Setback</h3>
<p>Aircraft Damaged and Stranded in North Africa</p>
<p>Saharan Desert, Colomb-Béchar: Mrs. Mollison, attempting to regain her previous air record from England to Cape Town, was unable to continue her journey yesterday because the underside of her plane was damaged here. Mrs. Mollison was greatly disappointed by the setback to her ambition. She is currently staying here, and her next course of action will depend on whether the plane can be transported to Oran for repairs. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>French Oran, North Africa: The famous British female aviator, Mrs. Amy Johnson Mollison, flew out from Gravesend Aerodrome in England the other day, intending to fly to Cape Town in South Africa in an attempt to break the record of three days, seventeen hours, and thirty-eight minutes set by the British aviator Rossier last month. However, at 5:45 PM last night, when flying to the city of Colomb-Béchar near the Sahara Desert, the fuselage was suddenly damaged, resulting in a setback midway and being stranded there. It is generally believed that the lady's ambition will not be diminished by this slight setback and that she still intends to continue her journey. The damaged parts have been telegraphed to England to be rushed for replacement. The mechanics at the local airfield are currently inspecting the fuselage to see if it can be repaired on the spot. The circumstances of last night's incident are recorded below: The lady was refuelling at the airfield in Colomb-Béchar yesterday and was about to take off for Niamey (in the Sahara Desert) when, after the wheels had travelled 600 meters on the ground, the rubber tire of the right wheel suddenly came off, causing the fuselage to lean over and the right wing to hit the ground and be damaged. The front propeller was slightly bent, and the landing gear was also broken. The fuselage was unable to take off. The lady immediately got out of the plane, fortunately unharmed. However, seeing that the plane was damaged, she could not stop sobbing. It is said that the ground at the Colomb-Béchar airfield is not very flat, which may have been the cause of the accident. However, according to the mechanics, there was a feeling that some parts of the plane were not working properly when it took off. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Japanese Naval Competition</h3>
<p>Japan's Budget for the Next Fiscal Year Inevitably to Expand</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The meeting between American disarmament representative Davis and Acting Minister of the Navy Stahle on the 3rd to discuss and establish the fundamental policy of the US Navy is the focus of attention for the British and Japanese navies. The Japanese Navy is paying particular attention to Stahle's determination to build replacement ships that are actual combat-ready vessels since he became Acting Minister of the Navy. According to the Japanese Navy authorities, there will necessarily be increased naval budgetary competition among the UK, US and Japan after 1937, even in the absence of a treaty limitation, and it is unlikely there will be large-scale shipbuilding exceeding our current expectations. Japan's naval policy is to ensure the security of national defense in the Pacific in the face of the US not abandoning its trans-Pacific operations. Therefore, the budget of the Japanese Navy in the 12th year of Showa (1937) will inevitably expand. (5th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>After Hauptmann's Execution, the Lindbergh Kidnapping Case Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Disbarred Lawyer Charged with Murder</p>
<p>Drayton, USA. Following the execution of Hauptmann, the kidnapper and murderer of the Lindbergh baby, his body has been claimed by his defense attorney, Fischer, and is scheduled for burial at 2:00 PM on Monday. New Jersey Governor Hoffman continues to criticize the unfair trial of Hauptmann and has requested State Assemblyman Conner to propose that the House of Representatives appoint a committee to investigate the entire matter. Windisch, the disbarred lawyer who previously secured a stay of execution for Hauptmann, remains in the Mercer County Jail today without bail and has been formally charged with the murder of the Lindbergh baby. Fischer has stated his intention to continue efforts to prove Hauptmann's innocence. Therefore, even though Hauptmann is dead, the Lindbergh kidnapping case is unlikely to end anytime soon.

<h3>Overview of the Japanese Publishing Industry in 1935: Over 4,000 More Books Published, but Few Are Excellent Due to Strict Censorship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a statement released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Japanese publishing industry saw great activity last year. There were over 4,000 more legally published books and pamphlets, with a total of 30,347, compared to the previous year. There were 186 newspapers and magazines published in accordance with the Newspaper Publication Law and 1,947 magazines published in accordance with the Publication Law. However, due to the authorities' control of thought and strict censorship, there were very few excellent works among them. (5th, Hualian News Agency)</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Having read a Tianjin dispatch in your esteemed newspaper of March 26th, "Japanese Establish Agricultural Experiment Station in Changli", the text included the statement that a Chinese person, Sun Shikun, is in charge. According to my understanding, Shikun works at the Changli Orchard established by the Beining Railway, and has no connection with the situations mentioned in the dispatch. I am deeply concerned that there may be a misunderstanding due to the similarity of names, so I am sending this letter to declare and request a correction. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Shen Bao, Sun Shikun, April 1st.</p>
<h3>The Financial Situation in Fujian Province is Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>Monthly Deficit Reaches 200,000 Yuan; Only 50% of March Government Expenses Paid in Advance</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Ticheng, the Director of the Construction Department, was transferred to be the Director of the Finance Department in Fujian Province, the financial budget has been calculated, and the monthly revenue and expenditure are in deficit by about 200,000 yuan. Therefore, when Chen took office, he first withdrew 100,000 yuan from the Construction Public Bonds he issued during his tenure as the Director of the Construction Department for use, and will return it as soon as the central government's aid funds are remitted. By March 30th, the Ministry of Finance had remitted 300,000 yuan in aid funds. After allocating 100,000 yuan to the Construction Department, there were only 200,000 yuan left. Therefore, on March 31st, the accountants of various agencies went to the Finance Department to collect the March expenses. Because the funds were severely insufficient, they could not be paid. The Finance Department is currently consulting with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to borrow the remaining 500,000 yuan of the 1 million yuan that the three banks jointly allocated to rescue Fuzhou's finances during the Lunar New Year for merchants to repay debts. They want to borrow it to cover military and government expenses, using the province's salt surtax as collateral. However, the various merchant guilds in the provincial capital believe that this fund was designated by the Ministry of Finance for rescuing the provincial capital's finances. Now that it is late spring and early summer, just when the market is starting to become active and funds are urgently needed, they immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the original plan be maintained and that the funds still be kept for merchants to borrow. It is unknown how the Ministry of Finance will resolve this. As for the Finance Department, it has been decided that 50% of the March government expenses will be raised and paid by April 5th. The remaining 50% will be paid in full no later than mid-April. Regarding austerity measures, they can be implemented only after being submitted to and approved by the Provincial Government Committee meeting. Public servants are generally worried because of fears of salary cuts or arrears. Furthermore, the people of the provincial capital oppose the reorganization of the house and shop tax. The previous disturbance was quite intense. Recently, Chen Ticheng, the Director of the Finance Department; Fan Xinzhi, the Director of the House and Shop Tax Reorganization Office; and Li Jinde, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, summoned the heads of all Baojia in the city to explain, and after the gentry Sa Zhenbing, Chen Peikun, and Wang Shen smoothed things over, the opinions of the officials and the people have become very close. That is, the reorganization measures from now on are specifically aimed at parts with tax evasion and concealment. Those who have already paid the correct tax amount will not be increased. For houses and shops with evaded or concealed tax amounts, officials will send personnel to form a committee with representatives of legal entities to assess the tax amount in order to seek fairness. People can still submit evidence and request correction if they believe that the assessed tax amount is inappropriate. (April 1st)</p>
<h3>Special Education Broadcast: The Importance and Promotion of the Baojia Movement (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Li Songfeng, Director of the Police Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>(C) Strength Must Be Concentrated — The biggest problem with administration now is "everything is being done, but nothing is being accomplished." This is especially evident in local organizations. For example, if there is a local self-government organization, it will also handle Baojia, organize a defense corps, and then organize a strongmen team... etc. There are too many things going on. The talent and financial resources in the locality are inherently limited. Combining them is still not enough. Now, dispersing them to so many areas, it's no wonder nothing is being accomplished! The biggest reason I advocated for incorporating Baojia into self-government earlier is this. Because self-government must complete the work of organizing and training the people, Baojia is the best way to organize the people. Since the nature can be merged, why don't we try to merge them to concentrate our strength?</p>
<p>(D) Application Must Be Convenient — If the nature is determined, the system is clear, and the strength is concentrated, but if the application is not flexible, then it still cannot be considered a reasonable organization. How can it be applied conveniently? Of course, the most important thing is simple organization and clear responsibilities. The Baojia adopts a chief system instead of a collegial system, and the levels of organization are not many, which can be considered very simple. Therefore, what we should pay attention to is the point of clear responsibilities. What matters can the Bao Chief decide and should handle, what matters can the Jia Chief decide and should handle, and what matters must be decided through the Baojia meeting, and what matters must be requested from the township, district, and county... etc. should all be specifically stipulated.</p>
<p>2. Improving the Selection of Personnel — Personnel are the foundation of the organization. No matter how good the organization is, if it is not filled with good personnel, that organization is dead. Therefore, personnel are especially important in any organization. For the Baojia organization, which is very simple, unlike complex organizations that have internal control and assistance, the conditions of people are more important. We believe that there are three points that should be noted regarding Baojia personnel:</p>
<p>(A) Must be Carefully Selected — This is the most important thing, because if the selection is not good, not only will Baojia affairs not be promoted, but the Baojia may also be used as a tool for evil, which is very dangerous! The selection criteria not only pay attention to ability, but also pay more attention to morality. In addition, interest and age should also be noted. The biggest feature of the Baojia system is that the appointment or change of Baojia personnel must be approved by the superior agency; and if the county magistrate believes that they are incompetent, they must also order the original recommenders to recommend again; this is where the Baojia spirit is inconsistent with the spirit of self-government. I believe that to improve the Baojia personnel, the selection must be stricter, and the superior agency's right to interfere needs to be further expanded. Because if not, it is not enough to achieve the goal of careful selection of personnel.</p>
<p>(B) Must Be Fully Trained — No matter how you select personnel, you may not be able to fully meet the requirements of Baojia, so Baojia personnel must be fully trained again. Many provinces are now implementing Baojia chief training, which is very necessary. Another point, we now know that civic training is a very important thing, but who should be responsible for the training? That is best no more than the Baojia chief; because Baojia is not only a universal organization, but also the best way to use political methods to implement education. In order to bear this obligation, the training of Baojia chiefs is even more important.</p>
<p>(C) Must Be Strictly Supervised — Because the internal control of the Baojia organization is very weak, and Baojia affairs are so complicated, if there is no strict supervision from the superior agency, it will not only easily lead to inertia, but also may lead to abuses! Therefore, the county government and townships must strictly supervise Baojia personnel.</p>
<p>3. Actively Promoting Undertakings — We require Baojia to have a reasonable system and sound personnel, and the purpose is nothing more than to facilitate the promotion of Baojia undertakings: so in promoting the Baojia movement, special attention should also be paid to Baojia undertakings. According to the Baojia laws and regulations, Baojia undertakings are very complicated; but we believe that the most important ones are the following:</p>
<p>(A) Training Strongmen — This is the most important task at present, and it is also the main task of Baojia, which must be actively promoted. Training strongmen can not only help maintain public security, but also strengthen the power of Baojia. There are many ways to train strongmen, but no matter what method is used, it must be based on Baojia; training strongmen without Baojia organization is training individuals, using Baojia to train strongmen is training organized people, the difference between the two is very significant.</p>
<p>(B) Labor Service — This is also the most important issue at present. We have said above that labor service is a powerful step in productive construction. To prevent floods and droughts, conquer nature, facilitate transportation, and increase production, we must start with labor service. Moreover, labor service takes social welfare as the object of effort, which is also very necessary in the transformation of people's concepts.</p>
<p>(C) Cooperative Undertakings — Cooperative undertakings can be said to be the most powerful way to revive the countryside at present, whether it is credit cooperatives, industrial cooperatives, consumer cooperatives... its effect is very great. The biggest obstacles to the promotion of cooperative undertakings are, on the one hand, banks fearing that loans are not guaranteed, and on the other hand, people distrusting the operation of cooperatives. But if Baojia is responsible for promoting it, it will be easy to succeed. Because Baojia is a solid organization and has close relationships with every household, it is also easy to understand the situation of each household and gain the trust of each household. Therefore, I believe that Baojia should actively take responsibility for initiating cooperation, and its effect will definitely be great.</p>
<p>(D) Social Education — The obstacles to the promotion of social education now are, on the one hand, the lack of teachers and funds, and on the other hand, it is difficult to make the teaching time not conflict with farmers' work. But if Baojia chiefs are responsible for promoting social education, these difficulties can be avoided. Using Baojia chiefs to teach not only avoids the problem of no teachers, but also saves expenses; and Baojia chiefs can also find ways to make the teaching time not conflict with the living conditions of this Baojia; implementation will definitely be easy and effective. Guangxi Province now uses trained township chiefs to concurrently serve as the captains of the militia reserve team and the principals of national basic schools, which is a very good example.</p>
<p>4. Raising Fixed Funds — Finally, we talk about the issue of funding. Nothing can be done without funding; it can be said that funding is the foundation for the success of any undertaking. Baojia is naturally no exception. According to the current situation, the funding for Baojia in various places is very small, so Baojia undertakings are difficult to achieve results. Moreover, because there is no fixed source of funding, temporary apportionments are enough to cause abuses and harm the people! Therefore, if we want Baojia to do well, we must first raise sufficient funds and determine the source of funding; we believe that the best way is to raise funds by operating public undertakings; this method is not only reliable but also does not disturb the people. Of course, the scope of Baojia is very small, and it cannot operate any large-scale production; but it is possible for Baojia to jointly operate small public properties. — Jiangxi Province once had "Bao Fields", "Bao Forests", "Bao Ponds", and other movements, which I think is a very adoptable method.</p>
<p>The above explanations on the promotion of the Baojia movement are only made in terms of organization, personnel, undertakings, and funding; due to time constraints, I cannot explain in detail, which I should apologize to everyone for. (End)</p>

<h3>The Motives Behind Germany's Sudden Occupation of the Rhineland</h3>
<p>— London Correspondence</p>
<p>Since the last World War, today should be one of the most tense and serious days for the European situation. This morning's newspapers published that Hitler would meet with the ambassadors of the UK, France, Italy, Belgium, and the four countries related to the Locarno Treaty this morning, and the German Parliament would hold an emergency meeting at 12 noon today. The people of London were discussing that there would be a major development. When the afternoon newspapers announced that 25,000 German troops had marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, the people's hearts were shocked. In the evening, the evening newspapers published a long speech by Hitler, and also published the note that Germany handed to the ambassadors of various countries, announcing the abandonment of the Locarno Treaty. Such news came one after another, making the general public astonished. Even the British, known for their calmness, could not help but panic. Tonight is Saturday, which was originally a good time for entertainment and leisure, but due to the tense international situation, there is no heart to enjoy red wine and beauties. Dance halls, cafes, and streets and alleys are all surrounded by an atmosphere of discussing the current situation.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden met with the ambassadors of Germany, Britain, and France and the charge d'affaires of Belgium this morning, and talked with each person separately for more than half an hour. As for the tension in Paris, it is even greater than here. The cabinet meeting originally scheduled for noon was changed to a secret consultation by the three ministers of the army, navy, and air force and the commander-in-chief of the army, Gamelin. Foreign Minister Flandin, in addition to meeting with the ambassadors of the UK, Italy, Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, held a so-called war committee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 6:00 PM today, attended by the prime minister and senior officers of the army, navy, and air force, and decided to request the League of Nations to impose financial and economic sanctions on Germany, and to deal with military action when necessary. The German reoccupation of the Rhineland is a direct blow to France. Given its position as a party involved, it is inevitable that it will have this passionate attitude.</p>
<p>According to the current reports from the Rhineland, the soldiers of Germany and France have become face to face. How will it develop in the near future? It is not possible to predict it for a while. When this correspondence is published, the situation may be clearer. The reporter originally came to London to visit the closing of the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition, and happened to encounter such a dramatic change in the international political situation. He rushed to inquire from all related parties and saw that the responsible personnel were extremely busy. In a very hurry, they made conversations separately. According to their observations, the following items are the main motives for Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland:</p>
<p>1. The Impact of the Ratification of the Franco-Soviet Pact — Since the signing of the Franco-Soviet Pact, the German side has expressed extreme dissatisfaction, because the purpose of the pact is to target Germany, which is extremely clear. In the summer of the year before last, French and Soviet Foreign Ministers Barthou traveled to Eastern Europe, intending to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and the Baltic countries. While the matter was still unfinished, Barthou and the King of Yugoslavia were assassinated in Marseille. Later, when France continued to negotiate the "Eastern Locarno Treaty" issue, it excluded Germany and Poland from the circle. By May 2nd of last year, French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin agreed on the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, which was actually a military alliance, and its target was Germany, which was known to everyone. The reason why Germany had not made any practical statement at that time was because the pact had not been ratified by the French Parliament, and there was still room for change. When the French Lower House officially passed the ratification last month, and the Upper House will also discuss the ratification this week, then the pact has become formally effective, which is something that Germany cannot ignore, hence the great reaction of reoccupying the Rhineland today.</p>
<p>2. The Result of Italian-German Diplomatic Activities — Italy was greatly pressured by Britain on the Abyssinian matter. Although France had the Rome Agreement, it could not provide any assistance. Instead, it implemented the so-called economic sanctions. The material loss is not worth mentioning. Spiritually, it also felt extremely embarrassed. Under this situation, it was unwilling to assume the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. According to the Locarno Treaty signed on October 16, 1925, Britain and Italy guarantee that Germany and France and Belgium will not invade each other. If one country invades another country, Britain and Italy will each assist the invaded country with force. The provisions of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland were originally forcibly recognized by Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. At this point, it voluntarily accepted it. The border between Germany and France was guaranteed by Britain and Italy. It has been peaceful for ten years. Recently, in retaliation against Britain and France, Italy has been unwilling to continue to assume this obligation. At the same time, it has also had friendly cooperation negotiations with the German side. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Germany, which cannot be missed. (It is said that Hitler had previously requested Mussolini to jointly announce the abolition of the Locarno Treaty, although it was not answered by Mr. Mussolini, but the influence of Italy beforehand may not be recognized by Rome.)</p>
<p>3. The Inevitable Steps of Germany's Revival — The Germans were bound by the Treaty of Versailles, which did not allow conscription, did not allow the construction of fortresses, the army was only allowed to have 100,000 people, warships could not exceed 10,000 tons, and air and naval power were not allowed to be expanded. In addition to bearing huge reparations, they also lost Alsace-Lorraine and Eupen-Malmedy on the border of Germany and Belgium, as well as all colonies. The left and right banks of the Rhine River were made into a demilitarized zone for thirty miles, and troops were never allowed to be stationed there. Although Germany signed these harsh conditions under duress on July 28, 1919, given the past glory of the German nation, it was unwilling to suffer this humiliation and never ceased to desire change. At that time, due to the poor economic situation after the war, it had to endure temporarily. Therefore, during the era of Foreign Minister Stresemann, it took full cooperation with France. After signing the Locarno Treaty, it also joined the League of Nations and shook hands with its enemies in Geneva. Later, the Dawes and Young plans were established. Not only was the amount of German reparations reduced, but the time limit was also determined. Due to the world economic panic, in 1931, Hoover's note and the Lausanne Agreement of 1932 stopped the payment of reparations. At this point, the page of the Treaty of Versailles has become ineffective, and Germany's economic revival has gradually had hope. However, the Germans' desire for revival is not limited to the economy. Military national defense cannot be subject to others for a long time. This step was completed by Hitler.</p>
<p>After the National Socialist Party came to power, it made demands for "arms equality," but was rejected by the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference (February 1932). Therefore, in October 1933, ten days after Hitler became Prime Minister, he officially announced his withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. In January of the following year, Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression treaty with Poland. On March 16 of last year, it officially announced the restoration of armaments and the implementation of the conscription system. At that time, the reporter happened to be traveling in Germany and witnessed the German people's enthusiastic support for the government's actions in Berlin and elsewhere, and deeply knew that this was indeed a universal demand for German revival. Later, the air force led by General Goering made a large-scale flight in Berlin. In June of last year, the Anglo-German naval agreement was established. The Germans will also restore their abolished naval power. At this point, what was left to the Germans by the shame of defeat in 1918 was the demilitarized Rhineland. Yesterday, 25,000 soldiers entered the Rhineland, assisted by tanks, artillery, machine guns, and 200 aircraft. The momentum was extremely majestic. The local Germans, who had been subject to other countries for a long time, have been suppressed, but now they can finally express themselves. The entire German people must also feel that the shame of the past eighteen years has been swept away at once. How pleasant is the feeling? Although the European situation has become more serious as a result, the Germans see this action as an inevitable action in Germany's revival, just as Hitler said in his speech to Congress at 12:00 noon today: "It is impossible to keep an honest and brave nation in slavery forever."

<h3>Xiamen Rice Price Problem</h3>
<p>Rice prices have soared in the past two weeks, with rice merchants taking the opportunity to hoard and speculate.</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Rice prices in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou have fluctuated wildly in recent ten-day periods, greatly affecting the lives of ordinary people. Investigating the reasons, only Zhangzhou produces rice in the southern Fujian area, but it is far from sufficient to supply the demand. Therefore, Xiamen and Quanzhou have traditionally relied on imported rice from Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Siam, and Rangoon. In the past, imported rice was tax-free, arriving in a steady stream and at relatively low prices. It was easy to transfer and adjust supply. However, in the autumn of 1933, with abundant harvests in the Yangtze River area, the dumping of foreign rice inevitably led to a situation where cheap grain hurt farmers. To protect domestic rural areas, the government implemented a tax on imported foreign rice. Xiamen, as a non-rice-producing area in southern Fujian, made a special exception, levying only half the tax on foreign rice. In 1935, the full tax was reimposed. When no tax was levied in 1933, foreign rice was only a little over five yuan per 100 catties (Xiamen market weight). In 1934, it rose to a little over six yuan. After the full tax was levied, it further rose to a little over seven yuan. At the same time, Xiamen rice prices also rose from a little over five yuan to seven yuan or seven yuan one or two jiao. A tax of two yuan and forty fen in national currency was levied on each dan of foreign rice. Therefore, after the tax was levied, it was difficult to compete with domestic rice, and imports gradually decreased invisibly. According to investigations, Xiamen imported 720,000 bags of foreign rice from Vietnam, Siam, and Rangoon in 1933 (each bag weighing 160 catties). With half the tax levied in 1934, imports were 440,000 bags. With the full tax levied in 1935, imports decreased to 190,000 bags. Previously, the authorities in Vietnam, Siam, and India lowered rice prices themselves to accommodate exports to China, making them suitable for sale in Xiamen. This year, with the tension in Europe, various countries competed to purchase and hoard rice in Southeast Asia, causing rice prices in Vietnam, Siam, and Rangoon to rise to 6.40 foreign yuan per 100 catties. Including the import tax and surcharges of 2.60 yuan, it often reached the number of nine yuan. As a result, foreign rice suddenly stopped being imported. Starting from December last year, the provincial government, to raise funds for security forces, also levied a rice donation of one yuan per bag on Zhangzhou rice exports. At the same time, the rice harvests in the Yangtze River provinces were not as abundant as in previous years, and Shanghai rice prices naturally increased, making it difficult to transport and adjust supplies to Xiamen. Moreover, southern Fujian rice production was insufficient for self-sufficiency. Considering these factors, in the past two weeks, rice prices have soared from one yuan and two jiao (the previous week) to eight yuan and six jiao. In terms of kilograms, every 100 kilograms rose from twelve yuan to fifteen yuan. Wealthy farmers and landlords in Zhangzhou, as well as speculators in Xiamen's financial circles, competed to hoard rice for speculation, resulting in Xiamen's daily rice needs of 700 bags, while rice hoarding reached more than 20,000 bags, without any slight decrease. This week, as Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Guangzhou heard of Xiamen's rising rice prices, they competed to transport rice for sale. The top offer has gradually dropped from eight yuan and six jiao to seven yuan and seven jiao, but transactions are decreasing. Currently, rice merchants are promoting the reduction of taxes on foreign rice to half the rate, and the abolition of the Zhangzhou rice donation, due to the high rice prices. Therefore, although the top offer has fallen, wholesale prices and retail prices remain unchanged. On April 1, retail domestic rice was still sold for eight yuan and eight jiao, and Vietnamese foreign rice for nine yuan and two jiao. In addition, there is another problem, that is, the inconsistent import tax rates on foreign rice. The Ministry of Finance stipulates the tax rate as 2.40 yuan in legal tender. Xiamen imports, including surcharges, are 2.60 yuan. However, the special tax rate for foreign rice imports in Guangdong is 1.428 hao yuan, equivalent to only 1.10 yuan in legal tender. Recently, at the request of the rice merchants, it was reduced by a quarter, reaching only 7.75 fen of legal tender, a huge difference. Therefore, Guangdong rice merchants transport foreign rice for import, while domestic rice exports are tax-free, so they transport red rice or foreign rice produced in Guangdong, disguised as domestic rice, to Xiamen, with a cost of only 7.23 yuan, selling it for 7.67 yuan in Xiamen, already making a considerable profit. Thus, the import of foreign rice in Xiamen requires a loss of 1.30 yuan, and Zhangzhou rice to Xiamen requires a loss of 3 jiao. Currently, Zhangzhou farmers are competing to transport rice to Xiamen for sale, while rice merchants are unwilling to sell at lower prices and unwilling to buy at higher prices. Therefore, the current rice inventory in Xiamen is large, the source is continuous, and the retail sales price is high and does not fall, which has a profound and significant impact on people's livelihoods (April 2).</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Relief for Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance announces a reduction in foreign rice tax, reducing the tax rate by one-quarter.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Both domestic grain and foreign rice in Guangdong Province have suddenly become expensive recently. To date, rice prices have not fallen. Many villagers in various regions are begging due to rice shortages in the countryside, and the lower classes in cities are also experiencing great hardship. Investigating the reasons for the rise in rice prices in various counties, it is actually because the various regions have entered a period of transition between the seasons since the spring. The late rice harvest last year has been sold out, and the new harvest has not yet arrived, relying on foreign rice for supply. However, the foreign exchange rate has risen, and foreign rice prices have become expensive accordingly, so some regions have suddenly experienced famine. As for the high price of foreign rice, it is purely due to the high foreign exchange rate. According to the Rice Bran Industry Association and the Rice Mill Industry Association, the reasons for the high rice prices are as follows: The legal tender in Guangdong Province has not yet been widely used in various counties. Rural farmers still use silver as the standard when selling grain, while rice merchants calculate the cost of purchasing grain in legal tender, which invisibly increases the cost by 20 yuan per 100 yuan. The exchange rate for Annam currency has risen sharply. Last year, 100 yuan of Saigon paper currency was worth 110 Hong Kong silver dollars. This year, 100 yuan of Saigon paper currency is worth 200 Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, last year, each 100 catties of Annam grain was worth about 3 Hong Kong dollars, but this year it is worth more than 4 yuan. Comparing the prices of domestic and foreign rice, after import taxes are levied, superior Annam rice costs more than 12 yuan in Guangdong Province legal tender per 100 catties, medium rice costs more than 11 yuan, and lower rice costs 10.50 yuan. Top-quality Siamese rice costs more than 13 yuan in Guangdong Province legal tender per 100 catties, medium rice costs 12 yuan, and lower rice costs 10 yuan. In the city, top-quality domestic rice costs more than 11 yuan per dan, medium rice costs 10 yuan and 67 jiao, and lower rice costs 9.56 yuan per 100 catties. In comparison, foreign rice is more expensive than domestic rice by 1 or 2 yuan per 100 catties because of the heavy taxation. Therefore, the two industry associations strongly requested the highest authorities to order the various counties not to prohibit exports without authorization. At the same time, they also petitioned the government to temporarily suspend the tax on foreign rice to alleviate the current rice shortage, and to resume the tax on foreign rice after the domestic new grain harvest and the regulation is even. After receiving the petition, the authorities, in order to comply with public opinion, instructed the Department of Finance to announce on the 20th a reduction in the special tax on foreign rice imports to maintain the food supply for the people. The announcement stated, "It is hereby announced that foreign rice imported into this province, from April 1 to May 21 of this year, will be reduced by one-quarter of the current tax rate to maintain the food supply for the people, and has been announced for distribution and reported accordingly. All imported grains are subject to the same regulations. In addition to the distribution and reporting, this announcement is hereby made for the general information of all merchants and citizens." The tax on each 100 catties of foreign grain is 7 jiao 2 fen in silver dollars, plus 2 yuan 1 jiao 4 li 4 hao in silver dollars, totaling 8 jiao 6 fen 4 li in silver dollars, plus 3 hao, equivalent to 1 yuan 1 hao 1 copper coin 3 wen 2 in legal tender. The current reduction is to 5 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars, plus 2 yuan 1 jiao 0 li 8 hao in silver dollars, totaling 6 jiao 4 fen 8 li in silver dollars, plus 3 hao, equivalent to 8 hao 5 copper coins 2 wen 4 in legal tender (April 1).</p>
<h3>Jingqian Railway, Shexian-Chunan Section to Start Construction</h3>
<p>—Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel for Re-Survey—</p>
<p>Yanhua Correspondence: The railway from Shexian County in Anhui Province to Chunan County in Zhejiang Province is a branch line of the Jingqian Railway. The Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Huizhou in April last year to survey the area, traversing mountains and ridges, and completed the survey after five months. Subsequently, due to the progress of other railway line projects, construction was not carried out immediately. Now, the Ministry of Railways, in order to connect Anhui and Zhejiang transportation and to facilitate passenger and freight transportation, plans to begin construction and complete this section of the project first. It has specially sent the engineering team leader Jin Qiyi, team members Zheng Xunchen, Gui Shenglin, and others to Wuhu to Huizhou to inspect the completed survey line. According to Jin and others, most of the areas traversed by the section are mountainous and rugged, with towering rocks, making construction extremely difficult. Therefore, although the railway line has been surveyed and completed, construction has been delayed due to the lack of funds. However, the Ministry of Railways believes that this railway is of great importance and cannot be delayed, so it has decided to find ways to raise funds to start construction as soon as possible. It also stated that this inspection of the railway line will focus on re-surveying in detail to save construction costs and avoid rocky areas. Once the survey is completed, they will return to Beijing to report and prepare a plan for submission to the ministry for review. It is expected that construction can begin in the autumn of this year. As for the Xuancheng-Tuncun railway of the Jiangnan Company, the survey has been completed long ago, but due to lack of funds, it is difficult to start construction in the short term. The Huishan Coal Mine, which is adjacent to the railway, initially planned to build a branch line from the mine to Sunjiabu to facilitate the transportation of coal for external sales. However, it has been suspended due to various obstacles and has not yet started construction. The Hefei-Yexian Railway, which connects to the Huainan Railway and is of great importance for connecting Anhui and Henan transportation, has been entrusted by the provincial government to the Huainan Railway Bureau to send personnel to survey, and the survey has now been fully completed. The provincial government plans to request a subsidy from the Ministry of Railways to start construction this summer (3rd).</p>
<h3>Decline in Population in Eastern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Due to devastation by Red Bandits, excessive population deaths</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Xin River basin in eastern Jiangxi Province has been ravaged by Red Bandits, including the factions of Fang Zhimin, Zhou Jianping, Zou Qi, and Shao Shiping, since 1927. After Zhao Guantao's troops captured Fang Zhimin last year, the banditry was finally quelled. However, the population in the newly recovered areas has died excessively, causing great damage to vitality. The restoration problem is extremely difficult. Recently, this reporter traveled from Nanchang to Hangzhou by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and carefully observed the situation along the way. From Nanchang through the counties of Jinxian, Luxiang, and Yugan, the fields were interspersed and the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard, but there were very few winter crops, indicating the depression of agriculture. After entering Guixi, the mountains overlap, with pillboxes scattered throughout. The villages seen were dilapidated and lifeless. Where it borders Yiyang, the rice paddies and vegetable fields were covered with weeds, and the landscape was desolate, with few traces of people. Only near the county seat did cultivated land account for 60 to 70 percent. Beyond this, in the area adjacent to Hengfeng, the villages destroyed by the bandits were filled with broken tiles and bricks, and the remaining houses had pillars but no walls, and walls but no tiles. The mud walls still bore traces of reactionary slogans that had been painted over. At Hengfeng Station, there was not a single person. The county seat was hidden among the continuous and towering mountains. Traces of bandit-fighting fortifications could be vaguely found. Hengfeng County was previously the location of the pseudo-central government of the four pseudo-provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and Geyuan in Hengfeng was the pseudo-provincial capital, suffering the most from the banditry and being the last county in the province to be recovered. After this, although the train stopped at various small stations, no one got on or off, which shows the scarcity of the population there. Entering Shangrao, the situation seen was also mostly desolate. Therefore, some people advocate for the immigration of people from Zhejiang to the area, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<h3>Completion of Guangdong Military Hospital</h3>
<p>Located in Xicun, a suburb, with perfect facilities</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong authorities previously built the Guangdong Military Hospital, choosing Dadao Mountain in Xicun, a suburb of Guangzhou, as the hospital site and starting construction. It has been completed in recent years, including offices, officer sanatoriums, senior officer sanatoriums, treatment rooms, surgical operating rooms, soldiers' wards, a public hospital, a kitchen, and a guard room. The hospital also has extremely complete facilities such as electrotherapy, X-rays, and other therapeutic equipment. The hospital was officially opened on March 30. At 1:00 p.m. that day, all the equipment in the hospital was opened for public viewing. As for the hospital's facilities, there is a seven-story soldier ward building, with two floors, covering an area of 123 wells, each capable of accommodating 250 to 300 people. It is entirely made of reinforced concrete and green glazed tiles, with a total construction cost of over 134,000 yuan, which took sixteen months to complete. There is a treatment room covering an area of 61.2 wells, internally divided into an X-ray room, an examination room, a treatment room, and an ophthalmology, otolaryngology, etc. In addition to treatment, it also combines academic research to seek progress, and the construction cost of the building is actually 41,330 yuan. There is a three-story general office building and officer ward, covering an area of 145 wells. The interior has the distribution of various departments of examination rooms, pharmacies, and warehouses. The officer ward can accommodate 200 people. There are two senior officer wards, each covering an area of 19.75 wells, each capable of accommodating 40 people, and is attached with an attendant room. There is a public hospital covering an area of 123 wells, which can accommodate 300 people. Its architectural structure is the same as that of the soldier ward. Before the construction of the hospital, Chen Jitang believed that the hospital was specifically set up for the treatment of soldiers and could not benefit the public, so he proposed to set up a public hospital in the hospital to accommodate civilian patients. By the autumn of last year, it was in the planning stage. Just as Hu Wenhu returned to Guangzhou from Southeast Asia and visited the German Hospital, he generously donated 100,000 yuan, and the hospital was completed. There is an operating room covering an area of 21 wells, with perfect internal facilities and extremely clean equipment. There is a one-story mortuary, covering an area of 7.68 wells, with separate rooms for funeral arrangements and cremation. There is a one-story isolation ward, covering an area of 90.08 wells, which can accommodate 50 to 80 people.

<h3>Wei Daoming Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is Said that Hu Zhan Tang Can Come North Soon, and There is Absolutely No Objection from the Southwest. According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Wei Daoming, who went south again, returned north from Hong Kong on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada liner some days ago, arriving in Shanghai at noon yesterday.

<h3>Wang Chonghui Denies Making a Statement</h3>
<p>Nose Bleeding Pus; Currently Seeking Medical Treatment</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee Member Wang Chonghui returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and stayed at Mr. Hu's residence on Gaoen Road. Due to a second recurrence of rhinitis, he only met with Cheng Tiangu and Wei Daoming in the past two days. He politely declined to see visitors in order to rest. Mr. Wang denied the report of his remarks, as he returned to Shanghai because his upper lip was swollen, making it inconvenient to speak. Therefore, he did not receive any reporters or make any statements. According to sources, Mr. Wang had pus and blood flowing from his nose yesterday and is continuing to seek medical treatment in the hope of recovering soon and going to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Temporary Calls Will Be Made Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>Opening Calls with the UK is Difficult, so Calls Through the Philippines are Being Planned. China's Provincial and Municipal Call Areas Will Not Be Expanded for the Time Being.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' International Wireless Telephone will temporarily open calls in early May at the request of the U.S. government for the opening of the Sino-American Trade Research Association in New York. Sino-British telephone calls are still being tested. After Sino-Japanese calls, China will not expand the call area for the time being because the long-distance telephone lines in various provinces have not yet been completed. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency learned the details from the International Wireless Radio Station yesterday.</p>
<p>Sino-American Calls</p>
<p>To develop trade relations between China and the United States, the U.S. government will hold a conference on Sino-American trade issues in New York in May of this year to promote the prosperity of trade between the two countries. Commissioners from the governments of China and the United States, as well as major traders, merchants, and experts from both countries, will attend the study and discussion. To facilitate prompt consultation between the government and merchants, the conference specifically requested the Chinese Ministry of Communications to temporarily open Sino-American international money telephones. It is now known that the Ministry of Communications has replied in the affirmative and ordered the International Money Radio Station, which is in charge of international telephones, to prepare everything and use it temporarily for the governments and business communities of the two countries at the time of the conference for calls at any time.</p>
<p>Philippine Trial Calls</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-British wireless telephone test, the Zhenru Radio Station is conducting trial calls with the British side during its spare time from broadcasting wireless radio each week, and the results are good. However, due to mechanical reasons, the official call period is temporarily difficult to realize. Because the radio station believes that the Philippines is closer to China, it is also conducting trial calls, which are extremely satisfactory. After the Ministry of Communications sets the call fee with the Philippine authorities, it will schedule the opening of calls.</p>
<p>China's Call Area</p>
<p>The reporter also learned from the radio station that since Sino-Japanese money telephones were opened on February 15, the Japanese side had expanded from Shanghai and Tokyo to 170 places such as Osaka, Kobe, and Yokohama on March 10. China's call area will not be expanded in the same way. According to the person in charge of the station, because the long-distance telephone networks in various domestic provinces have not yet been completed, the focus is still on Shanghai and Nanjing. As for provinces and cities that have already built long-distance telephones and want to call Japan, they can also make connections. As for officially expanding the scope of the call area, it is temporarily not planned to be realized.</p>

<h3>British Family Planning Expert Mrs. Martin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Invited Reporters to Report on the Meaning of Family Planning; Will Give a Public Speech Tomorrow and Go to Peiping in a Week</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Mrs. Martin (Mrs. Edith H. How. Martyn, namely Xin Matian Yide), honorary secretary of the International Family Planning Association in London, England, departed from London last November with Mrs. Margaret Sanger, president of the International Family Planning Association, and traveled to Honolulu, the South Pacific Islands, the Philippines, India, and Egypt, arriving in Hong Kong on February 19. Mrs. Sanger fell ill on March 8 and returned to the United States for recuperation. Mrs. Martin and her husband went to Guangzhou and other places to continue giving speeches, and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. yesterday on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada liner, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Dr. Wu Liande, director of the seaport quarantine office, and Ms. Zhou Zhongweiqing, director of the Family Planning Guidance Center of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, boarded the ship to welcome her. Mrs. Martin is 60 years old, with white hair, wearing a red hat, a taupe tweed suit, and a green silk scarf. Mr. Martin is 61 years old, a famous British artist who does not pay attention to grooming, has long hair that is all white, wears a felt hat and Toric glasses, a light gray suit, and carries a cane. He is slightly shorter than his wife. After exchanging pleasantries with the welcoming party on the ship, they borrowed Mr. Wu and Ms. Zhou and went to the New Asia Hotel to open Room 529 to rest.</p>
<p>Purpose of Promotion Mrs. Martin met with Chinese and foreign reporters on the ship at 3:00 p.m. at the New Asia Hotel. By that time, Mrs. Martin had already traveled alone to Shanghai. According to Mrs. Martin, controlling births is to improve human evolution. If family planning is considered immoral, it would be more appropriate to say that producing children without the ability to raise, educate, or cultivate them is immoral. Our (Mrs. Martin's self-proclaimed) purpose of promoting family planning is not the natural elimination of ordinary people, but the use of artificial methods to allow the superior to survive and the inferior to be eliminated, to improve health, save family finances, and promote national peace.</p>
<p>Family Planning Effectiveness Mrs. Martin continued, "One thing can be used as clear evidence of the benefits of family planning. In 1876, the birth rate in England was 36 percent, and the mortality rate was 28 percent. Now the birth rate has been reduced to 15 percent, and the mortality rate has also been reduced to 13 percent. Reducing births and preventing deaths allows outstanding talents to serve society and the country together, and the foundation for international peace can be laid." Mrs. Martin also believes that this kind of movement is passive.</p>
<p>Personal Benefits From a personal perspective, family planning has four benefits: clothing, food, education, health, and occupation. Parents can reduce their burden by reducing the number of children, and children can develop their strengths and seek happiness for mankind. Now Germany prohibits young people with diseases from marrying, but it would be more appropriate to provide family planning knowledge to prevent Beisheng production. At present, there are medical institutions in the United Kingdom and the United States that guide family planning and do not hinder the pleasure of couples in bed, so they are quite trusted by the general public.</p>
<p>Universal Propaganda Mrs. Martin continued to elaborate that after the establishment of the International Family Planning Research Association, branches have been set up in more than 20 countries including New York, London, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ceylon, China, Finland, France, Geneva, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Romania, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and India. Members are all over the world.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Speech Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., Mrs. Martin will give a lecture on "Population and Family Planning" at the YWCA at No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate. She will stay in Shanghai for a week, go to Nanjing, transfer to Tianjin, Peiping, and go to Hankou. She will stay in China for a total of six weeks, then go to Honolulu and Honolulu to meet Mrs. Sanger, and then return to England. When asked whether to go to Japan or not, the lady replied bluntly that many friends in Japan had persuaded her to go, but recently the Japanese government has been quite indifferent to this issue, so she decided to stop going.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry's Fish Market is Scheduled to Open on the 19th</h3>
<p>Shareholders Will Pay Shares Today and Hold a Shareholders' Meeting on the 9th; the Frozen Fish Industry Opposes it and Will Not Be Affected</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, in order to control the fishing industry and relieve fishermen, the Ministry of Industry initiated the establishment of a fish market. After Mr. Wu Dingchang took over as Minister of Industry, he was more concerned about this and changed it to a joint official-business operation, with Qian Xinzhi as the official shareholder representative and Du Yuesheng as the business shareholder representative. The share issuance has been very smooth. It is now known that the business shareholding of the fish market has been prepared and is limited to today to collect shares. It is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 9th to elect directors and supervisors. It is expected that it will open for business on the 19th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Share Doubtful Fundraising</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry plans to set up a fish market with a capital of 1.2 million yuan. Since it was returned to a joint official-business operation, after both parties subscribed for 600,000 yuan each, the business shareholding was actively solicited by Mr. Du Yuesheng. Now, the 600,000 yuan business shareholding has been prepared and is limited to today to pay the shares to the China Exchange Bank. The official shareholding of 600,000 yuan has long been collected and new houses have been built. It is now scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 9th of this month. At that time, directors and supervisors will be elected, and the board of directors and board of supervisors will be established. It is expected that it will be able to open on the 19th of this month.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Some businessmen in the city's swimming fresh industry are worried that after the business opens in the future, the commission will be reduced from the existing 8% to 7%, which is quite dissatisfied and expressed opposition. The original subscription of 50,000 yuan will be withdrawn, but when inquiring with relevant parties, this matter will not affect the progress of the fish market due to the opposition of the frozen fish industry. It is still actively preparing.</p>
<p>Report to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi, the representative of the official and business parties, reported to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry in Beijing that the business shareholding of the fish market has been collected, and reported on the progress of the market's establishment. He also stated the opposition of the frozen fish industry and the collection of the business shareholding. When the shareholders' meeting is held on the 9th of this month, Qian will also participate in the capacity of an official representative. It is learned that Minister Wu will personally come to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony when the fish market opens.</p>
<p>Eager to Establish</p>
<p>The purpose of the Ministry of Industry's establishment of the fish market is to reduce the burden on both fishermen and fishmongers, so it charges less commission and strives for control. Generally, fishermen and fishmongers are delighted to hear this news. In the past, fishermen such as Xu Yifei petitioned the Ministry of Industry and asked it to be established as soon as possible. They also requested that the participation of fish merchants in the fish market should not increase the burden on fishermen, and sent representatives such as Zhang Shenzhi to Beijing to petition Minister Wu. Yesterday, more than 30 representatives of fishmongers in various vegetable markets in the city, such as Xu Yinqing, Hong Guisheng, and Lu Fuquan, submitted a document to Du Yuesheng, requesting that the fish market be established as soon as possible, and requested that the fish trade in the Sixteenth Concession be abolished after the establishment, so that fishermen could be less exploited and benefit fishmongers.</p>

<h3>Hebei Fellow Villagers Association Plans to Request the National Government to Give Sun Hongyi a National Funeral; and Prepare to Hold a Memorial Service</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Mr. Sun Hongyi, a veteran revolutionary giant, devoted himself to the revolutionary cause during his lifetime and once destroyed his family's wealth to support the Premier. Since his death in Shanghai last month, all parties have mourned him. It is now known that the Hebei Fellow Villagers Association in this city specially held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to commemorate Mr. Sun, because Mr. Sun had made contributions to the party and the country during his lifetime. It was decided to submit a request to the National Government to hold a national funeral to encourage future generations. At the same time, the association also plans to jointly hold a memorial service with all sectors of society to commemorate him, and has begun preparations.</p>
<h3>The Hunan Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission 代放 Red Cross 急赈</h3>
<p>The Jianghe River suffered severe floods last summer. The Shanghai Red Cross Society of China allocated 40,000 national coins, 8,000 bags of flour, 11,800 pieces of clothing, and 10 trees of epidemic prevention water to the Hunan Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission at No. 505 Henan Road in this city to release 急赈 to the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shandong. The China International Famine Relief Commission appointed Yangzi Disaster Relief Advisory Committee and Mr. Ji Luyi of the Hunan and Hubei branches to distribute them separately. At this moment the three provinces of Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shandong have not yet completed the task, while the 急赈 released by the Hunan South Branch has been completed. The report is now recorded as follows. Last summer, the Yangtze River Basin suffered floods, and the disaster situation in the ten lake-adjacent counties of Hunan Province was particularly serious. The branch was appointed by the general association to release the 急赈 of the Red Cross Society of China in Shanghai to Hunan, with Li County suffering the most severe disaster. After requesting the general association for approval, it was specially released to the victims of the county, and the original intention of agricultural relief was adopted to organize disaster-stricken people's groups. The disaster-stricken people elected representatives to receive relief funds and relief supplies for direct distribution. Disaster relief was not dispersed to benefit the people and avoid the labor of the victims returning to receive relief. A 急赈 director was temporarily assigned, and two instructors and one agricultural relief inspector were transferred as temporary inspectors. At the same time, several local methods and churches were invited to organize a 急赈 inspection office. After two months, a total of 27 disaster-stricken people's groups were established, with 3,759 households and 10,107 large and small disaster victims. 9,500 yuan of relief money, 2,000 bags of flour, 2,492 pieces of cold clothes, and 5,794 bottles of medicine were distributed. When inspecting and releasing, there were sporadic bandits in various places, and travelers were forbidden. The inspection and release work was very difficult. Fortunately, various cooperatives helped to investigate day and night, and they were able to complete it safely. The special organization adopted in this 急赈 was very good, and the disaster victims praised it endlessly. However, in addition to the prescribed 5% of 500 yuan, more than 700 yuan was used, and it was proposed that the branch's surplus should be used to pay for it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reporter: The Amount of Smuggled Goods in North China is Astonishing, Averaging More Than 500 Tons per Day</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Daily News translated by the Foreign News Agency, although the smuggling law was implemented on March 21, the average daily amount of smuggled goods in North China in the past two days has been more than 500 tons. On April 1, the smuggled goods in Tianjin included 640 tons of sugar, 30 tons of rayon, and a lot of other tobacco, paper, cotton, cloth, and sea cucumbers. The places with the most smuggling are Changli, Beidaihe, and Luanzhou. Recently, the Bei'ning Railway Administration and the Customs authorities agreed to prevent smuggling, but it was ultimately ineffective. Minister Kong, according to the report of Lin Shize, the supervisor of the Tianjin Customs, visited President Chiang and discussed countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Change of Registrars of County Land Bureau</h3>
<p>Lu Zhubin, Huang Kejing, Wang Hezhang, and Jin Boyu, registrars of the Shanghai County Land Bureau, were sent to the provincial bureau for training and graduated by order of the provincial bureau two years ago, and were still sent to serve in this county. Now, by order of the provincial bureau, Lu Shengbin was transferred to the Jinshan County Land Bureau as a registrar, and Wang Hezhang was transferred to the Danyang County Land Bureau as a registrar. They have left the county and gone to their posts.</p>
<h3>The Hydrographic Office Notifies the Shipping Community to Change the Light Beacons in Various Places</h3>

<h3>Dazzled by Profit, Changed the Air Ticket and Tried to Collect the Bonus</h3>
<p>Zhu Shouchun from Gaoyou, who is nearly forty years old, lives in a shed on Tianbao Road, Zhabei. He is a cobbler, but his business is not good, which leads to intermittent cooking smoke on weekdays. Zhu was extremely bored and had a whim to privately scrape the unwinning 21st issue of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery that was drawn on the 3rd of this month with a knife and changed it to No. 143829. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, he accompanied a party member to the Xiemao Sheng Tobacco Exchange Shop opened by Zhao Maosheng from Pudong at No. 129 Linping Road to redeem the prize, claiming that the lottery number seemed to have won the fourth prize and requesting to redeem it. At that time, Zhao Maosheng, the owner of the shop, thought it was a real prize at a glance, but after looking at it under the sun, he realized that it was altered and forged. He immediately called the guard on duty to arrest Zhu. One party member escaped by taking advantage of the opportunity. The forged lottery ticket and the matching number list were taken to the Linping Road Police Station together with the people. After an interrogation, it was文申 to the General Bureau for investigation because the case involved altering the lottery ticket and attempting to falsely collect the bonus, which constituted fraud.</p>
<h3>Thieves Planned to Rob a Tobacco and Paper Shop; Two People Were Arrested After Being Discovered by Detectives</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. the night before yesterday, detectives Zhang Ziying, Yang Yilong, Qin Youyu, and investigator Xu Guilin of the French Concession received a tip that there were many violent thieves who were planning to rob Ruifengxiang Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 130 Route Tenant de la Tour, and asked them to rush to arrest them. After hearing the report, the detectives rushed to wait secretly. After a while, they saw three or four burly men coming face to face and peeking into the tobacco and paper shop. Detective Zhang saw that they were very suspicious, so he gave a secret signal and suddenly stepped forward to arrest them. As a result, two people were caught, one named Wu Baoqing, 34 years old, from Jiangbei, and one named Bu Wanjun, 37 years old, from Yancheng. A six-inch Browning pistol with ten bullets was seized from Wu's hand on the spot and taken to the police station. They also confessed that the robberies at No. 10 Gaoli Road, Gaolifang, No. 9 Xiafei Square, and Qianjiatang were all committed by them. The police station ordered them to be escorted to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Austrian Professor Erwin Reiffenstein: Lecture on Sino-Austrian Cultural Relations at the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association Reception</h3>
<p>Professor Reiffenstein Personally Wrote the Manuscript and Delivered the Lecture in Chinese</p>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Cultural Association recently held its third reception in Shanghai. The event began with an opening address by Chairman He Zhenya. Next, Mr. Tong Deqian, our newly returned representative to Austria, delivered a speech on Sino-Austrian relations. Following this, the Austrian Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Oegermiller, gave a vote of thanks. Finally, Dr. Erwin Reiffenstein, an Austrian professor at Jiaotong University, was invited to deliver a lecture in Chinese on Sino-Austrian cultural relations. Dr. Reiffenstein has considerable knowledge of Chinese characters, having studied under the former Austrian Minister to China, Baron von Rosthorn. Baron von Rosthorn was a follower of Confucius and provided much support for China's reform efforts during his tenure. He has now returned to his country and established a lectureship at the Vienna Imperial Museum, where he promotes Chinese culture. Last year, he was delighted to hear of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's promotion of the New Life Movement, demonstrating his concern for China. Dr. Reiffenstein, having been educated by him, also strongly praises Chinese culture. His lecture at the meeting was personally written. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we Austrian expatriates in Shanghai are very pleased to welcome Mr. Tong Deqian here today. He has given us the opportunity to hear his interesting and beneficial lecture, increasing our knowledge and broadening our horizons. We are extremely grateful to him. I have known Mr. Tong since before he went to Austria, which was more than eight years ago. Because of our long-standing relationship, I will take the liberty of briefly introducing this diplomat's career to everyone. Mr. Tong grew up in a family that has produced diplomats in China for generations. As a result, his knowledge and experience in politics and diplomacy are almost unmatched by other diplomats. He spent a great deal of time in Europe and observed the problems of small and weak nations in various political issues. He also understood the important relationship between China and European and League of Nations politics. Therefore, he began studying this issue early on. One only needs to look at the map of Europe after the war to immediately understand the importance of the problems of small and weak nations in international politics. Europe is very divided politically and ethnically, almost like hell compared to the Far East. The Far East has never been as unified as Europe. The result of the European War did not improve the situation but made it worse. When new national borders need to be determined based on peace treaties, the League of Nations must first appoint a committee of experts to conduct on-site investigations. These committees often select Far Eastern diplomats to chair the committee to demarcate countries. These Far Eastern representatives must be familiar with all the geographic, economic, political, and ethnic issues related to this problem. Whether these problems are resolved properly has a great impact on China, as it can gain or lose sympathy. Therefore, the person in charge must be familiar with such problems and be a good politician and diplomat with fixed goals. Mr. Tong has the knowledge and experience needed to serve abroad. He was able to gain the sympathy and friendship of all levels of Austrian society in such a short time precisely because of this. Mr. Tong understands Austria's difficulties, knows Austria's needs, and is familiar with Austria's great mission. Therefore, based on the spirit of mutual benefit between China and Austria established by the former Austrian Minister to China, Dr. von Rosthorn, he has done his best to help Austria. Whether at home or in foreign diplomatic circles, he always tries to make people fully understand Austria's problems and its needs, and to draw their attention to Austria's international mission. Mr. Tong once said, "Austria is the heart of Europe. If this heart does not beat, Europe's spiritual and ethical mission in the world will be over. If this heart is sick or injured, the whole of Europe will be greatly affected." He is absolutely correct. From this, we can understand how Mr. Tong was able to win the hearts of the Austrian people so soon after presenting his credentials in Vienna. He is a close friend of Austria's three great prime ministers. The first was Dr. Seipel, who was then known as one of the most famous statesmen in Europe and the world. He treated him as a personal friend. The second was Dr. Schober, who was known as the protector of security in Europe and was a world-renowned police expert. He treasured Mr. Tong's diplomatic experience. The third was Dr. Dollfuss, the Austrian Prime Minister who sacrificed himself for the country and whom the Austrian people will always remember. At that time, because Mr. Tong's Chinese was very good and he was very knowledgeable about Chinese culture, he often discussed Chinese culture, Chinese thought, Chinese art, and other issues with Mr. Tong. Unfortunately, these three Austrian giants have all passed away. Mr. Tong represented China in Austria and was able to make the Austrian people feel very deeply about the Chinese people, and to promote thorough understanding and harmony on both sides, which is truly rare. Once, the Austrian Prime Minister, because Austria had not had a formal diplomatic representative in China for a long time, expressed his apologies to Mr. Tong. Mr. Tong replied with an interesting and correct remark, "Sir, why not allow me to continue to represent Austria and Austrian culture in China at the same time?" This sentence made people feel very emotional and very meaningful at the time. These seven years that Mr. Tong spent in Austria were during the reign of three great prime ministers in modern Austrian history. In these seven years, Mr. Tong felt that he had completely become an Austrian, and Austria had become his second home country. This fact is not considered strange by foreigners in Vienna, because the mentality of the Austrian people, compared to other Europeans, has several very special advantages. These advantages are the same points between the Austrian and Chinese people. Chinese people feel very comfortable in Austria, and Austrians also feel very comfortable in China. The reason is here. The Austrian people's amiability, liveliness, freedom, and contentment are well known. This is the result of the old culture. The Austrian people can still enjoy their lives under the greatest difficulties and can further use their various difficulties as good materials for artistic thought, to write poetry, make music, paint scores, or make sculptures. Hundreds of years ago, there was a musician in Vienna who was generally called "the lively Augustine". Although he was very poor, he was always very lively. This person can be said to be representative of the Austrian people. Because the Austrian people have this special spirit of contentment, even under the most serious economic difficulties after the European War, Vienna was still able to maintain its high cultural level and continue to maintain its reputation as a cultural center and as the capital of music, art, and science. Austria's very old culture and its love of beauty are what make it the same as China. Two thousand years ago, the Romans created Vienna. From that time until now, the Austrian people's love of beauty has continued to develop with ideals, completely forgetting material life. All of life's problems must be solved with effort, not with force. Isn't this the same place between Chinese thought and Austrian thought? Unfortunately, this spirit of contentment is no longer very appropriate in modern times, so that the people of China and Austria cannot be happy. Because the Austrian people have this special mentality, their politics and policies are naturally not the same as others. This is not only the case in small Austria now, but it was also the case in large Austria before the European War. I would like to give a few examples to prove it. In 1898, which was the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the Chinese Emperor was determined to reform. The Empress Dowager Cixi resumed her regency, imprisoning the Emperor in Yingtai, abolishing the new laws, and killing party members. At that time, the foreign ministers in Beijing were unwilling for the Chinese to reform, so they all helped the Empress Dowager Cixi. When they met in Beijing to discuss this issue, only one foreign minister slammed the table and angrily opposed them from seeing the Empress Dowager Cixi. He said that he knew the Emperor was not sick, and that the laws he had newly established were very good. What did the Empress Dowager know? She only wanted to seize power. If the foreign ministers were really friends of the Chinese people, they should do their best to help the Emperor. According to his opinion, they should all see the Chinese Emperor and ask him about his condition in person. But the foreign ministers had no vision and did not listen to him. They went to see the Empress Dowager Cixi directly. In this way, they harmed China. The minister who opposed them did not go to see the Empress Dowager Cixi. Who was this person? It was the Austrian Baron von Rosthorn. Later, after he returned to his country, someone blamed him for not cooperating with other foreign ministers in Beijing at that time. He went to see the Austrian Emperor to explain everything, and strongly advocated that Austria must not implement imperialist policies like other countries, but only help China become a strong and powerful country to protect and develop their five thousand years of culture. The Austrian Emperor very much agreed with him and asked him to return to the Far East to represent Austria. Later, on another occasion, the Qing government ordered a large number of military weapons from an Austrian weapons factory. Because this Austrian baron was the Austrian minister, the Chinese government naturally had to contact him. Minister von Rosthorn immediately expressed his disapproval. He said that if they really had to buy weapons, why did they have to insist on buying them from Austria? Of course, this sentence made people feel very strange at that time. Later, when a large batch of weapons was shipped to China, a reception ceremony was held. After an official representing the Chinese government said some nice things, Minister von Rosthorn replied with a few words. He originally did not want them to buy weapons from Austria, because Austria's strength was not in arms but in civilization. Since he could not stop them from buying them, and now the weapons had arrived in China, he now only had one hope, that the Qing government would not use these weapons bought from Austria to kill Chinese people in the future. At that time, these words of the Austrian were strange to most people, but soon they realized that his hopes at that time were very reasonable. It turned out that during the Chinese Revolution, the Qing government used those weapons to kill many Chinese people. The fundamental principle in Minister von Rosthorn's policy was to reorganize China internally and make it a strong country. In this way, the weapons they needed would not only not need to be supplied by others, but could be manufactured entirely by themselves. Wouldn't that be great? Unfortunately, Minister von Rosthorn's ideals were not realized. China, from that time until now, has bought so many foreign weapons and sent so much money to foreign countries. As a result, how small are the benefits they have received themselves? In 1921, an American, Gilbert Reid, in his book "The Struggle for Freedom in China," criticized this Austrian Minister von Rosthorn, saying, "This diplomat is a great scholar of Chinese and a pioneer fighter for Chinese freedom and rights. He served in Beijing for a longer time than the sum of the time served by the seven foreign ministers who opposed him" (these seven ministers were the ones who forced the Chinese government to declare war on Germany and Austria during the European War; Minister von Rosthorn opposed it alone, but he was in the minority). Now Minister von Rosthorn is a pioneer fighter for Chinese culture, ethics, and philosophy in Vienna. He admires Confucius's forever immortal truths the most. Twice a week, a very small number of people who are determined to learn gather at the Chinese Research Institute inside the Vienna Imperial Museum to learn Chinese with Minister von Rosthorn. I am also one of his students. In the Chinese Research Institute he created, there are more than 20,000 Chinese books, all of which are excellent research materials on Chinese literature, including classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections. They are all excellent editions. These books were collected by Minister von Rosthorn himself over the 27 years he served in China. It is truly a famous cultural site in Austria, so the Austrian government also does everything possible to help him organize this Sino-Austrian spiritual center. Minister von Rosthorn often received great help from Mr. Tong in his cultural work. I remember once, due to certain circumstances, the Chinese Cultural Center in Vienna suddenly faced a great danger. If it were not for the joint efforts of Mr. Tong and the Austrian government, we in Austria today would probably not have such a center of Chinese culture. Mr. Tong is a close friend of Minister von Rosthorn. It is very strange that one is a Chinese-ized Austrian, and the other is an Austrian-ized Chinese. Neither of them are just talkers; they are practitioners. Their idea is that world peace depends on thorough mutual understanding between all nations. Although we Austrians cannot supply China with cannons and poison gas, we have music and poets, art and science, and we can exchange them for the philosophies of China's transcendent teachers, Confucius, Lao Tzu, Zhuang Tzu, Mencius, and other philosophers, and we can exchange them for the abstract works of Li Bai, Du Fu, and countless poets of the Tang Dynasty. As for the price, we firmly believe that Mr. Tong feels very comfortable in Austria, and we can understand him very well. On our part, he also believes that we feel very comfortable in his big and beautiful homeland, that is, in China, the most ancient in culture, in China, which emphasizes spiritual beauty, in China, which emphasizes both education and art, and in China, where the sacred art of cooking is most developed.</p>

<h3>Qingming Festival: Shanghai County Forbids the Burning of Silk and Paper Money</h3>
<p>The Zhuanqiao Rural Improvement Association believes that tomb sweeping during Qingming is a good custom in our country and should be promoted. However, in recent times, relatives and friends visit each other, burning ingots and silk, and preparing wine and food, which consumes a huge amount of money. Moreover, precious spring light is wasted on meaningless bad habits. In this extraordinary period, it is especially important to actively ban them. It recently submitted a request to the county government to issue a notice to inform the public to reform bad habits in the spirit of the revolution, and ordered the district office and the public security bureau to carry out persuasion. Yesterday (the 5th) was Qingming Festival, and public security bureaus in various counties have increased the number of police officers to carry out persuasion.</p>

At 10:30 the night before, he bought another pack of poison pills, totaling 340 pills, to take back to the boat. When he passed through Bao Ren Street in the city, he was spotted by Li Shupo, a police officer on duty, who saw that he looked flustered and questioned him. He found red poison pills on Song's body and immediately took the man to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. According to Song Afu's confession after being interrogated by Officer Chen, he was entrusted by a friend to carry the pills. When asked where he bought them, he replied that he had bought them three times in a certain sports club at No. 2 Runde Lane, Dabujie, Xiaodongmen, but he could not identify the person who handed over the pills.

<h3>Chauffeur and Woman Commit Adultery: Man and Woman Each Sentenced to Two Months</h3>
<p>Wang Ayu from Ningbo, 28 years old, has been working on ships. He married Pu Amao, i.e., Wang Pu, 28 years old, and lived together in the stove room at No. 52 Yuqing Lane, Bair Road. Because of his work, Wang was not often at home. His wife could not get used to sleeping alone and had an affair with Cao Genbao (31 years old, from Haimen), who was a driver in a certain mansion. On the 25th of last month, Pu Xian recruited her lover to her home for a tryst. Unexpectedly, her husband Wang Ayu suddenly came home and caught them. He arrested the adulterer and adulteress, but Wang did not send them to the police. Instead, he extorted 500 yuan from the adulterer Cao Genbao as compensation for the loss of marriage. Later, it was reduced to 200 yuan, but Cao was still unable to arrange it. Therefore, he reported it to the police and took Cao and Pu to the police station together. After questioning by the police chief, he was told that the plaintiff Wang Ayu should not have privately extorted money from the adulterer, which violated the criminal law. Therefore, he was also included in the defendant's position and sent to the Second Special Court together. According to the confessions of Pu and Cao Genbao, they admitted to adultery. Wang Ayu admitted to extortion and illegal detention. After the debate was concluded, Cao Genbao and Pu Amao were sentenced to two months of imprisonment for committing adultery with someone else while having a spouse. Wang Ayu was fined 30 yuan and given a two-year suspended sentence for illegal detention and depriving others of their freedom of movement.</p>
<h3>The Two Criminals Who Stabbed Li Weiyou Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Weiyou, a native of Huaian, Jiangbei, residing in a bungalow in Luli, Yangshupu Road, worked at the Tongxing Yarn Factory near Linqing Road. On the 25th of last month, at noon, he had a verbal dispute with Mrs. Zhang, wife of his fellow villager Wang Chunjun, at the factory, and they engaged in a scuffle. Mrs. Zhang sustained minor injuries. She returned to her home at No. 127 Yangshupu Road and told her husband. Wang Chunjun was furious. The next day, at 8:15 PM, he invited more than ten friends, including Liu Fuhai, to Li's house. Wang dragged Li out and questioned him about a resolution, demanding tens of dollars for Mrs. Zhang's medical expenses for her injuries, or else he would file a lawsuit with the police. Li completely refused. Thereupon, he was stabbed in the head, back, waist, and buttocks with knives. He fell to the ground and cried for help. Chinese detectives Liu Changgen and two Chinese constables from number 1627 arrived after hearing the alarm, apprehended Wang and Liu, and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. The injured Li was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Wang and Liu were sent to the First Special Court. It was ordered that the victim's recovery be assessed before further action. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that Li Weiyou was present in court to testify and requested that he be questioned. Li testified that Wang Chunjun had dragged him outside, and after a disagreement, immediately ordered the crowd to attack him, and he was stabbed with knives. He stated that the injuries were likely not serious due to his larger build than Liu Fuhai, and that for the sake of peace, he requested that the two defendants be spared further investigation. Wang and Liu denied intentionally causing harm to others and requested leniency. Liu Fuhai retained lawyer Jia Xisi to represent him. Judge Jiang ordered them to be remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Corporation Strives to Improve All Air Routes, Focusing on Transportation to the Southwest and Between Beijing and Shanghai, and Aspiring to Achieve International Airmail Service in the Future</h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation currently operates four air routes, totaling 4,510 kilometers, connecting the northwestern provinces. Large aircraft fly on these routes, arriving on the same day, providing convenience for passengers. Recently, flights were extended to Kunming to improve transportation between the southwestern provinces and Beijing-Shanghai, which is considered important for domestic economic and cultural communication. The company's current and previous year's flight operations are described as follows:</p>
<p>General Situation of Domestic Air Routes</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of each air route, the Shanghai-Xinjiang route was temporarily suspended west of Lanzhou due to the Xinjiang political upheaval in July of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933]. Despite continuous negotiations throughout last year, there is still no hope for resumption in the near future. The Ping-Guang and Lanzhou-Baotou routes, which were opened in the 23rd year [i.e. 1934], have been operating on schedule since November. The Ping-Guang route, however, has only been operating between Beiping and Zhengzhou since July of last year. In July, upon the order of the Ministry, the Shaanxi-Rong route, from Xi'an via Hanzhong to Chengdu, was established on a temporary basis. After more than a month of preparation, it was officially opened. However, due to the lack of a suitable airfield in Hanzhong, no station was temporarily established there. In December, another order was received to establish the Beijing-Yunnan route. However, due to the harsh climate in Guiyang and other places along the route, and the long distance, the cost of maintenance was very high. Therefore, approval was sought from the Ministry of Communications to change it to the Shaanxi-Yunnan route, which was opened on the 1st of this month. Regarding the flight schedules of each route, except for the Ping-Guang route, all other routes only had one round trip per week in the 23rd year. Due to the progress of business last spring, the flight schedules of each route were gradually increased. Since September, all routes have been uniformly increased to two round trips per week.</p>
<p>Technical Aspects Improve Daily</p>
<p>Regarding technical improvements, good results have been achieved. At the beginning of operations, the radio stations installed at each station and inside the aircraft, in addition to the shortwave transmitters used for business purposes, also adopted longwave models, intending to gradually equip with direction-finding and blind-flying equipment to ensure the safety of navigation. Since the 23rd year, in addition to the radio stations at the airport, intermediate radio stations have been added at appropriate locations between stations in areas with adverse terrain and climate, to maintain radio communication with aircraft at all times. By the end of last year, in addition to the radio stations inside the aircraft, a total of 23 airport and intermediate radio stations had been established. The main task of each land-based radio station is to maintain contact with aircraft during flight, report local weather conditions at any time, track aircraft, and provide aircraft with necessary information. In addition, since June of last year and throughout the entire year, two local climate reports were issued daily for domestic meteorological circles and general aviation needs. These climate reports are broadcast from the Nanjing station on the shortwave frequency of 47 meters at 8:45 and 14:45 daily. In order to seek greater safety, blind flight experiments began last year. In the initial stage, only direction-finding was notified (ground radio stations measured the direction of the aircraft and notified the aircraft), and it was tested between Changsha and Guangzhou. After three months of effort, it has now been changed to finding directions on its own (the aircraft independently measures its destination) and is universally implemented on each air route. The flight distance between Shanghai and Chengdu is 2,000 kilometers, with several stops in between. In winter, in order to arrive in one day, some night flying is necessary. Therefore, since the opening of the Shaanxi-Rong route during the ninth month, necessary night flight equipment has been installed at Longhua Port. In the darkness, even in adverse weather conditions, there is ample safety due to direction-finding guidance. All boundary lights, obstruction lights, and floodlights at Longhua Port have been gradually completed over the past three months.</p>
<p>Future Plans for International Airmail</p>
<p>Regarding future plans, the Ping-Guang route currently only operates between Beiping and Zhengzhou. The section from Zhengzhou via Hankou and Changsha to Guangzhou is also planned to be resumed. It is currently in the planning stages. The realization of international airmail methods, such as Shanghai-Xinjiang route connecting to the Russian border, would require only five and a half days for the flight from Shanghai to Berlin, Germany. This has been proven by the fact that two JU52 aircraft flew from Berlin to Shanghai in September of the 22nd year. Alternatively, if Shanghai takes the route via Myanmar and India to Berlin, it would take only seven or eight days to arrive. This is also proven by the fact that GU52 large aircraft came to Shanghai several times in September of the 23rd year and August-September of last year. In order to meet the hopes of people at home and abroad, it is still hoped that efforts will continue to be made to resume the entire Shanghai-Xinjiang route, so as to promote the realization of international mail transportation arriving in five days between Europe and Asia. If there is ultimately no solution, it is also planned to take Shanghai-Yunnan as a base and seek another route from Kunming via Myanmar and India to reach the European continent. This still relies on the support of the government authorities and the assistance of people from all walks of life to facilitate its completion.</p>
<h3>Yu Rizhang Memorial Service Held at the YMCA Yesterday</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Dr. Yu Rizhang was held at the YMCA in the Ba Xian Qiao at 3:00 PM yesterday. Guests attending the memorial service included Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Yan Fuqing, Mu Ouchu, Lu Ganchen, Dong Xiujia, Fang Jiaobo, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan, Wu Deshi, Bu Fangji, Wu Yifang, Liang Xiaochu, Yu Ensi, Ding Shujing, and Yu Rixuan, among other Chinese and Western gentlemen and ladies, numbering several hundred people. The memorial service venue was the YMCA Grand Auditorium. A portrait of Dr. Yu Rizhang was hung in the center of the podium, with two rows of white candles on either side, and elegies, mourning couplets, and wreaths were hung all around. Those who personally delivered eulogies were seated on the podium, and guests were seated in front of the podium.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>The ceremony adopted a semi-religious format. The meeting began at exactly 3:00 PM, and the order was as follows: 1. Music; 2. Scripture reading; 3. Prayer; 4. International chorus singing hymns; 5. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, representing President Jiang Jieshi, Minister Kong Xiangxi, Dr. Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaoji, representing the Shanghai Local Association, Dr. Qian Xinzhi, and representatives from the Pacific International Academy, including Hu Shi, delivered eulogies; 6. International chorus singing hymns; 7. Bishop Wu Deshi, Dr. Bu Fangji, and Dr. Wu Yifang delivered eulogies; 8. International chorus singing hymns; 9. Lu Ganchen and Liang Xiaochu delivered eulogies; 10. Yu Rixuan gave a thank you speech on behalf of the family; 11. The entire assembly stood and sang hymns; 12. Blessing; 13. Music. The ceremony ended at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Eulogies Also Noted</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, representing Executive Yuan President Jiang Jieshi, delivered a eulogy stating, "I, on behalf of President Jiang, attend the memorial service and feel deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Yu Rizhang, whose life's achievements have now passed into immortality. Mr. Yu devoted himself to the cause of the nation and society, and is truly a guide for the youth, as he was able to fulfill his responsibilities as a human being and develop his personal talents, fulfilling his obligations as a human being." Minister Kong Xiangxi's eulogy stated, "Mr. Yu's lifelong work can be described as 'giving his all until his dying breath.' Mr. Yu was a rare talent, serving the YMCA for more than twenty years and dedicating his life's essence to the YMCA's cause. At the same time, he also devoted himself to religious organizations and public welfare institutions with similar aims. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as a negotiator in Hubei Province, and his efforts were remarkable. He then served as an aide under Li Songqing, a pioneer of the revolution, and later as an executive of the YMCA, dedicated to national affairs with the spirit of a common man, and devoted himself to national diplomacy, upholding justice and fairness for the country internationally. Three times he went abroad, traveling internationally. While in the United States, he heard of the fall of Jinzhou in the Northeast, and was anxious all night. The next day, he visited the US Secretary of State. Because the conversation lasted too long, he fainted, thus planting the seeds of his illness. In his later years, he deeply realized that the fundamental need of the country was to create a national personality if we want to talk about saving the country, so he loudly called for 'building the nation with personality' as the only prerequisite. What Mr. Yu has left to the world in his decades of life is definitely not measured by the short-lived years. Now that his physical body has lost its function, his spirit and career will forever remain in the world, and will become more and more apparent over time. I have known Mr. Yu for many years, and our friendship is extraordinary. Now that I hear of his sudden death, I am saddened. I have briefly described his life's ambitions for later commemoration." There were also elegies by Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, and others.</p>
<p>A Brief History of Yu Rizhang</p>
<p>Yu was the eldest son of Reverend Yu Wenqing, a pastor of the Anglican Church in Hubei (Rev. Wenqing is still alive). He was born in Wuchang in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty [1882]. He graduated from the Boone College in Wuchang, St. John's University in Shanghai, and Harvard University in the United States, earning a Master's degree in Education. After returning to China, he taught at Boone College and later served as its president. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as a negotiator in Hubei Province. In the first year of the Republic [1912], he served as the secretary to Vice President Li Yuanhong. Later, at the request of the National Association of the YMCA, he served as the Director of the Lecture Department, devoting himself to promoting social education. From then on, he abandoned the idea of officialdom and devoted himself to social movements. During the Washington Conference, he and Dr. Jiang Menglin were elected as national representatives to attend the meeting and lectured to various American groups, changing international public opinion. Our country's diplomacy finally declared victory. In the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], the National Christian Council of China was established, and he was elected as its president. He often traveled to various places to give lectures for the sake of the association's affairs, and gradually suffered from heart weakness due to exhaustion. In the 22nd year [1933], disregarding the doctor's advice, he went to the United States again. While talking with former Secretary of State Stimson, he suddenly suffered a stroke. After several months of treatment, he was able to return to China, but the illness had already taken root, and he eventually died from it. He left behind four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Xin Si, is currently a trainee doctor at Peking Union Medical College. The next son, Xin An, works for Dairen Company. The eldest daughter, Ms. Qing Sui, is the wife of Huang Renlin, the General Secretary of the Nanjing Lixishe. The rest are all of school age.</p>
<h3>Qingming Tomb Sweeping Causes Fire Due to Burning Paper Money</h3>
<p>Coffins in Chicken Feather Shop Affected</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhu Gu, a 33-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 19 Zhujia Zhai, Shenjia Garden, Zhabei, went to her ancestral tomb in the wasteland of Song Park Road to sweep and pay respects at 9:30 AM yesterday (Qingming Festival), and burned paper money. The wind blew the ashes and flames, spreading to the chicken feather shop opened by Sun Arong and Zhang Zhou, natives of Wuxi, at No. 4, Lane 42 nearby. The fire was quite intense. The No. 124 Fire Brigade, upon receiving the alarm, dispatched a pumper truck to the scene and made every effort to extinguish the fire. After an hour, the fire was finally extinguished, destroying three thatched houses and 50 bales of chicken feathers. Afterwards, the fire starter, Zhu Gu, was taken to the Yongxing Road Police Station for questioning. Because the case involved public danger and was a criminal matter, a document was prepared and, together with the plaintiff, Sun Arong and Zhang Zhou, was sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Further news: At 10:30 AM yesterday, there were many coffins placed in a thatched shed in the wasteland of Zhujia Temple near Zhongshan Road, West Shanghai. Because someone went to sweep the tomb and burn paper money, the remaining embers fell and immediately caused a fire. The fire brigade dispatched a truck to the scene to extinguish the fire. The fire was finally extinguished. The coffins were destroyed, and the corpses were charred, a truly miserable sight.</p>
<h3>Zhuanqiao Agricultural Education Center Schedules Respect-the-Elderly Meeting</h3>
<p>Promote the Spirit of Old Morality and Implement the New Life Movement</p>
<p>The custom of respecting the elderly is very prevalent in Zhuanqiao, a county-administered area. The Zhuanqiao Agricultural Education Center has an organization of old farmers to promote the custom of respecting elders, exchange opinions, and promote rural affairs. Recently, the Zhao Family Pond Office of the Shanghai Suburban Rural Improvement Zone held a respect-the-elderly meeting.

<h3>Zhou Baodi Gives Birth to a Son After Divorce</h3>
<p>Zheng Ayun Firmly Denies Paternity, Court Fails to Mediate</p>
<p>Zhou Baodi, a local woman residing at No. 17, Fushou Fang, Lane 260, Baikai'er Road, Dalianwan Road, is 19 years old. In January of last year, she was married to Zheng Ayun, a wealthy businessman residing at No. 131, Renshou Li, Lane 419, Dalianwan Road, through a matchmaker. However, after the marriage, the couple's opinions differed, and they were incompatible. Eventually, they broke up, and agreed to divorce in August of the same year, with a divorce agreement as evidence. However, Zhou Baodi was pregnant early in the marriage. Therefore, when she went into labor on the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month of last year, she indeed had a son. She then notified Zheng Ayun to confirm paternity, but Zheng firmly denied it. Zhou Baodi believes that the father-son relationship is a direct blood relationship. Although the marital relationship between parents is eliminated due to divorce, the father-son relationship is not affected by divorce in any way. Moreover, according to Articles 1062, Section 1 and 2 of the Civil Code, the child she gave birth to can be proven to be Zheng's legitimate son, and he should be responsible for confirming and raising the child. Therefore, she retained lawyer Chen Wen to file a petition with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting confirmation of paternity. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Meng opened a court session for mediation. Because Zheng Ayun's side did not appear, the mediation failed. It was ordered that a formal lawsuit be filed.</p>
<h3>Four Bags of Drugs Seized in Rice Field</h3>
<p>Police Chief Zheng Bibo of the Wusong Paotaiwan Police Station seized seven flour bags of white powder, a raw material used to manufacture the narcotic drug "red pill," in the jurisdiction of the police station on the morning of the 4th of this month, and arrested three suspects, Wang Tongxiang, Liu Qijin, and Chen Baolin. Because the case involved drug trafficking and the smuggling and concealment of drugs, the suspects and drugs were sent to the General Bureau for investigation. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Police Chief Zheng again found four flour bags of the same white powder drug in the rice field of farmer Zhao Fengming near Paotaiwan. He immediately led the police to take the items back to the station for temporary storage, and at the same time prepared a document to report to the General Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation. Because the drug is very valuable, and as many as eleven flour bags have been seized in two days, the estimated value is no less than tens of thousands. The location where it was found was also in the rice field, and everything seemed to have a code. With the smuggling of so many drugs, there may be a very large drug manufacturing organization in the vicinity, which is also unknown. Therefore, the police station is currently conducting reconnaissance on all sides, by land and sea, and there will soon be developments.</p>
<h3>Industrial Circles Adopt Guizhou Province's Anise Oil for Trial Use</h3>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Team Considers it Excellent; Wuzhou Trading Company Has Packed Three Barrels for Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Industry Society, anise oil is a major raw material in the chemical industry. Guangxi Province produces it in abundance, and it is exclusively operated by the Wuzhou Import and Export Trading Company of the province, with very wide monthly sales. However, eight or nine out of ten used by the chemical industry in Shanghai are imported, resulting in huge losses. When the Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Team went south for inspection, they went to Wuzhou to investigate the anise oil in detail and considered it to be of excellent quality. Wang Zhenfang, the head of the Hongkou Office of the Bank of China and a member of the inspection team, contacted the Wuzhou Trading Company and requested that the anise oil be transported to Shanghai for trial use by the China Chemical Industry Society for promotion. The Wuzhou Trading Company has recently approved the request and has packed the anise oil into large barrels, totaling 1,143 catties, and shipped it to Hong Kong. It will be shipped to Shanghai by boat in the coming days and will be taken back by the Hongkou Office of the Bank of China for trial use by the Chemical Industry Society. It is said that all chemical factories will adopt domestic products in the future and will no longer purchase foreign goods to prevent losses.</p>

<h3>Informant's Tip-Off Cases Should Be Approved and Awarded by Customs</h3>
<p>Customs Tax Commissioner's Notice</p>
<p>The Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs has issued Notice No. 1540 regarding the handling and awarding of informant tip-off cases. The notice states that the current practice of the Customs for awarding informants is to give a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of smuggled goods seized based on the tip-off, up to a maximum of 40%. In order to avoid disputes between informants and the Customs regarding the award method, it is specifically notified that informants who come to the Customs to report must have their reports reviewed by the Customs to determine whether they are acceptable before being accepted. Otherwise, the Customs may refuse to accept them. After the tip-off has been accepted, the Customs must still send personnel to investigate and verify that the report is accurate before the award can be given. Informants may not demand an award regardless of whether the report is accurate or whether the smuggled goods have been seized. Furthermore, informants must strictly comply with the Customs' decision on whether or not to give an award and may not dispute it, causing disputes. From the date of this notice, informants who come to the Customs to report must willingly comply with the above points without objection. If they disagree with the Customs' decision, they must submit their appeals to the Customs for forwarding to the higher authorities for review. This notice is hereby issued for general information. Tax Commissioner Baron Sen.</p>
<h3>Jurisdiction Error in Rape and Abduction Case</h3>
<p>Lawsuit Should Be Filed with Qingdao Authorities</p>
<p>Dou Zhennian, a Shandong native residing at 328 Zhoujiazui Road, Youheng Road, previously hired a lawyer to represent him in a criminal private prosecution in the Special Second Court against his fellow townsmen Zhang Ren'an and his wife, who reside upstairs in a barbershop at 87 Jixiang Street, Fa Da Road, and Zhao Lingsheng, who works in the business department of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, for disrupting his family. The petition stated that the plaintiff's wife, Wang Yuying, had been seduced by the third defendant when they were living together in Shanghai. After the plaintiff discovered this, he took his wife and young son back to Qingdao and resided in Yong'an Lane, Jiaozhou Road. In January of the 23rd year, the third defendant sent the first and second defendants to Qingdao to abduct his wife and young son to Shanghai. After his wife and children were abducted, the plaintiff became ill with anger and was unable to act or come to Shanghai to search for them. He has only now come to Shanghai and discovered the defendants' addresses, but does not know where his wife is hiding. The actions of the first and second defendants constitute a crime under Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and the third defendant is guilty of a crime under Article 240, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same law. He requests that the case be summoned and investigated according to law. After the summons was sent, the first and second defendants appeared in court. They did not admit to conspiring to abduct the plaintiff's wife and were ordered to return for further review at a later date. The plaintiff's wife, Wang Yuying, suddenly surrendered to the court with her representative lawyer, Wang Shizong, claiming that Wang Yuying had come to Shanghai on her own because her husband was unable to support her and is now working as a dancer in a dance hall to support herself. She had not been abducted by anyone. She only learned of the situation after reading the news reports and therefore surrendered herself and requested an investigation. Judge Wang reviewed the confession and ruled that the plaintiff's complaint was under the wrong jurisdiction and instructed the plaintiff to file a lawsuit with the jurisdictional authorities in Qingdao. The relevant documents were transferred to the case and the defendants were released on bail.</p>

Without asking questions, they swung axes at Wang Yongqing's head and face. Wang was unable to dodge, resulting in six or seven knife wounds to his right shoulder, left leg, and head. He fell to the ground, unconscious. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled west along a small road. The two women then helped Wang into a car and took him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>China Foreign Joint Famine Relief Society Begins Dredging the Quan River in Shandong</h3>
<p>The Quan River originates from the springs northeast of Wenshang County in Shandong Province and flows into Shushan Lake southwest of the county, with a total length of 80 li. Every summer flood, the water level rises sharply, and the rapid flow of the river often causes flooding.

<h3>He Tianjian's Painting Exhibition Closes</h3>

<h3>After Students from Various Schools in Peiping Were Arrested, Some Students at Peking University Suspended Classes</h3>
<p>Tsinghua Investigates the Situation of Arrested Students, Yenching University to Resume Classes</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) Students from various schools in Peiping held a memorial service for Guo Qing at Peking University the other day, parading with a coffin and resulting in the arrest of many male and female students by the police. Initially, 14 people were discovered, but after investigation, a total of more than 50 were arrested. Peking University only had one female student, Luo Fuyou, from the College of Liberal Arts for Women. All schools are currently trying to rescue the arrested students. However, Chiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, stated that he could no longer take responsibility for protecting the arrested students. The situation in various areas is as follows:</p>
<p>Peking University Students Disobey the President: After the coffin of Guo Qing was carried into the Third Courtyard of Peking University during the memorial service, the president of Peking University, Chiang Menglin, convened an administrative meeting that evening. The meeting passed a resolution to suspend the activities of the student union and expel students Wu Peicang, Wu Shengsan, Han Tianshi, and Ye Jilin. The student union disagreed with this approach and posted a notice on the 3rd, which reads as follows: "The school authorities suddenly issued a notice on April 1st, suspending all activities of the union. This union was formed by representatives elected by all students, and the school authorities cannot arbitrarily destroy it. Therefore, before a resolution to suspend the union's activities is passed by all students, all work should continue as usual. This is hereby announced." Furthermore, all students in the third year of the physics department and the first year of the chemistry department at Peking University suspended classes starting on the 2nd because the school expelled students and refused to retract the decision. They also convened class meetings to discuss rescue measures. A joint meeting of various departments at the school passed the following resolutions today: 1. No strike; 2. Request the school to retract the expulsion decision in the name of the class meeting; 3. Request the school to immediately release the nine arrested students on bail; 4. Request the school to guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future.</p>
<p>Tsinghua Safeguards Student Safety: The Tsinghua University Student Union held a representative assembly on the evening of the 2nd, attended by more than 30 representatives from various departments. The assembly passed the following resolutions: 1. Request the school to grant a one-week spring break starting next week; 2. Request the school to do its best to release the arrested students on bail. The meeting adjourned at around 10 o'clock. According to Tsinghua President Mei Yiqi, the school sent people to the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the arrested students. The Public Security Bureau's response was unclear. The school authorities decided to investigate the facts and will, within possible limits, go to the Public Security Bureau to seek their release if the Public Security Bureau permits the school to bail them out.</p>
<p>Yenching University Has Hope for Resumption of Classes: Yenching University students, who voluntarily suspended classes on the 2nd, are scheduled to hold a general assembly on the 4th to discuss the issue of whether to resume classes. According to general observations, there seems to be a possibility of resuming classes. Students arrested from the school, Wang Lingxian, Cheng Jia Zeng, Ke Jialong, Wang Rumei, Wang Yongqi, etc., are all students of excellent character and academics who rarely participate in activities. Everyone was surprised that they participated in the Guo Qing memorial service and were unfortunately arrested.</p>

<h3>Shi Youhui Talks About Track and Field's Intention to Give Up Attending the World Games</h3>
<p>Since our country announced its participation in various programs and the list of candidates for the World Games, Shi Youhui, of the China Track and Field Association, considering that only one person is dispatched for track and field, to fight as a lone army, the players will definitely feel extremely lonely, trembling, and long-suffering mentally and in terms of strength, suggested that the National Sports Association request to send additional personnel. The National Sports Association did not approve due to financial difficulties. Unexpectedly, later there was an event of adding a Western boxing athlete, which seems to contradict the condition of "financial difficulties," arousing Shi's dissatisfaction. The reporter met Shi yesterday in the downtown area. According to the conversation, if the National Sports Association only sends one person and does not increase the quota, then track and field only has the option of giving up, because what competition can one person go to, and so on.</p>
<h3>Zhou Ruquan Wins 10,000-Meter Race; Original First Place Xie Xingdao Disqualified for 51 Minutes, 28.4 Seconds; Elderly Ge Jingkang Still Participates, Receives Special Award</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education-sponsored second 10,000-meter race walking event was held yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. in the city center. Seventy people registered, sixty-five officially participated, and sixty-three finished the entire course. Initially, Xie Xingdao won the championship with a time of 51 minutes and 28.4 seconds. Unexpectedly, he was disqualified, and Zhou Ruquan, who came in second, was promoted to first place. His time is missing. After the competition, prizes were awarded on the spot, and nineteen people were selected. Their names are as follows:</p>
<p>First Place: Zhou Ruquan; Second Place: Zhang Xianlun; Third Place: Xu Aichen</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Zheng Xingen; Fifth Place: Xu Guofu; Sixth Place: Tang Wenyi</p>
<p>Seventh Place: Zhou Yinhua; Eighth Place: Wu Runchang; Ninth Place: Jing Wenkui</p>
<p>Tenth Place: Cai Yuan; Eleventh Place: Dai Fengyong; Twelfth Place: Zhu Shiying</p>
<p>Thirteenth Place: Hu Yongkang; Fourteenth Place: Hong Shaoping; Fifteenth Place: Li Fuyuan</p>
<p>Sixteenth Place: Xu Pengke; Seventeenth Place: Chen Chungeng; Eighteenth Place: Cheng Changgeng</p>
<p>Nineteenth Place: Zhu Shengyuan</p>
<p>Xie Xingdao Initially Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was clear and sunny, and the climate was pleasant. The sixty-five participants in the race were all in high spirits. At 9:00 a.m. sharp, they gathered in front of the Municipal Government for registration and started westward from Fuxi Inner Road. The Bureau of Education's guiding vehicle led the way, and the competitors vied fiercely, making it difficult to discern who was in the lead. After 500 meters, Xie Xingdao broke through and took the lead, with Zhou Ruquan closely following, remaining close by. Qiu Dechang, Zhang Xianlun, and others also steadily advanced. The order remained unchanged when they reached Songhu Road.</p>
<p>Zhou Ruquan Comes from Behind</p>
<p>However, Zhou Ruquan, full of ambition, no longer lagged behind. Upon reaching Zhengtong Road, he stepped on the gas and overtook Xie Xingdao. Xie was even momentarily overtaken by Qiu Dechang, dropping to third place, but regained his position at the Haitong Road intersection. After completing one lap, Zhou was only a few meters ahead of Xie. Two hundred meters behind Xie was Qiu Dechang, and 300 meters behind Qiu was Zhang Xianlun, followed by Xu Aichen and Guo Xingen. Xu Guofu, Shi Wenkui, Zhou Yinhua, Tang Wenyi, Zhu Shiying, and Wu Runchang were far behind.</p>
<p>Xie Xingdao Displays His Power Again</p>
<p>As the second lap began, Xie Xingdao suddenly surged forward like a raging horse at Guohua Road, overtaking Zhou Ruquan to regain the lead. The remaining competitors maintained their original positions. Although Zhou Ruquan tried several times to catch up, he failed to realize his ambition as Xie Xingdao refused to relax. After that, the overall outcome was largely set. There were few changes in the second lap. At around 10:00 a.m., Xie Xingdao reached the finish line first, with a time of 51 minutes and 28.4 seconds. Zhou Ruquan was 80 meters behind, and it was another 400 meters before Qiu Dechang arrived at the finish line. Following him were Zhang Xianlun, Guo Xinhua, Xu Guofu, Tang Wenyi, and others. Everyone had reported in by about 10:40 a.m. The elderly Ge Jingkang also participated in this year's event, finishing in 53rd place, which was truly commendable.</p>
<p>Zhou Ruquan Still Wins the Championship</p>
<p>After a short wait, the referees announced the results. Based on the inspection of the athletes' form, Xie Xingdao and Qiu Dechang were not selected due to their posture. Zhou Ruquan still won the championship. However, Xie and Qiu both displayed excellent spirit, and Director Pan gave them special awards as encouragement, compensating them for their loss. The Bureau's promotion of sports and encouragement of athletes was clearly evident in this.</p>
<p>Prizes Awarded on the Spot After the Competition</p>
<p>After the competition, the award ceremony was held in front of the Municipal Government steps. Chairman Jiang Jianbai and Master of Ceremonies Ding Shoutang first had Deputy Director of the Meeting Affairs Ma Chonggan report. He announced that the route for this year's race was twice as long as last year's, and the number of participants was also more enthusiastic, with 70 registered, mostly from commercial and industrial sectors, demonstrating the widespread popularity of sports across all sectors. Due to budget constraints, everything was simplified, he said. Next, Section Chief Jiang, representing the mayor, delivered a speech, hoping that the athletes would maintain their spirit and strive continuously, and that future participants would be even more widespread, so that the public would pay attention to sports, which would be the only way to revitalize the nation. Subsequently, Shao Rugan announced the rankings, and finally, Section Chief Jiang presented the awards. The first-place winner received shields from Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Minister Kong, the "Xinwen Bao" newspaper, and a flag from Director Cai. The second-place winner received shields from Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Commander Yang, the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper, and a flag from Li Zhaohuan. The third-place winner received shields from Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Director Wu, Director Li, and a flag from Weng Zhilong. All nineteen winners received prizes, and the elderly Ge Jingkang also received a silver shield and a continental silver cup from Director Pan, designated for those who win two consecutive championships, which is currently kept by the Bureau of Education. All participants received commemorative medals.</p>

<p>The annual Jiangwan Cross-Country Race, organized by the Westerners' Athletic Association, started yesterday morning at 11:00 AM from the west gate of Hongkou Park. The entire course was six miles long. Gathered generals, a bustling crowd, a truly grand occasion. As a result, both the team and individual championships were won by Yi Bing. The slender monkey Wang Zhenglin reached the finish line first with an excellent time of 29 minutes and 34.4 seconds, breaking his own previous record of 30 minutes and 8 seconds from the previous year. The runner-up, Wu Wenlin, was only 50 meters behind. Niu Hongquan, the famous Shandong long-distance runner, was unexpectedly not selected. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Shanghai Team Departs Today for Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Games</h3>
<p>Westerners' Athletic Association's Mr. Spick Also Accompanies the Team to Tianjin</p>
<p>This year's Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Football Match is scheduled to be held on the 10th in Tianjin. The lineups for both Tianjin and Shanghai have been announced previously. The Shanghai team includes fourteen players, including Roberts, Dai Linjing, and others. The Tianjin team includes eleven players, including Matiev, Gong Fusun, Sijing, and others. The entire Shanghai team is scheduled to depart for Tianjin on the Pingshu Railway at 4:00 PM today, accompanied by Mr. Spick from the Westerners' Athletic Association, who will serve as the manager. In addition to the Interport Match on the 10th, the team will also have two friendly matches on the 11th and 13th, and return to Shanghai at 7:00 PM on the 15th. The complete roster is as follows:</p>
<p>Roberts, G. Greenburg, Mata, Guan Huanan, Gu Bo, Brett, Davis, Endaye, Boselli, S. Greenburg, Dai Linjing, Simmons, Xu Wenkui, Fuen</p>
<h3>Incomplete Lineup: Youyou Suffers Another Defeat; Fashang Wins Again 5-2</h3>
<p>Youyou and Fashang, two strong teams from the Westerners' Athletic Association, were evenly matched in this year's A-League. They first met at Shenyuan the other day, where Youyou suffered a disastrous defeat with a fragmented lineup. Yesterday, the two teams met again at Yiyuan. Youyou, after days of intense battles, faced this strong opponent, and the situation of labor versus leisure was clearly determined. The Westerners' Athletic Association is intensifying its efforts to conclude the league, leading to a disjointed schedule and failing to leave any leeway for the participating teams, which is truly regrettable. As a result, Youyou suffered another crushing defeat of 2-5 in this unfortunate atmosphere, allowing the invincible Fashang to dominate one side. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Fashang:</p>
<p>Baisai Zhong, Bo Qisi, Jack Walter, Pei Er, Parker, Remidi, Bao Xiuman, Liao Huate, Roberts Stov, Fafan Que, Lancai Er</p>
<p>Youyou: Wang Caigao, Zhang Rong, Jiang Shanqing, Yun Feng, Chen Zhenxiang, Mai Tinglin, Xue Yongyuan, Xu Jingcheng, Xu Wenkui, Zhong Yongshen, Qiu Zhenan</p>
<h3>Zhang Yingda vs. Medina: Carom Billiards Finals</h3>
<p>Starting Today, Four Matches Will Be Held to Determine the Winner with 2,000 Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Carom Billiards Senior Finals are scheduled to be held today and tomorrow in four matches. The total score is 2,000 points, and the first to reach the final score wins. Among the many competitors, three are particularly noteworthy: China's Zhang Yingda, Britain's Bernal, and Portugal's Medina. Since Britain's Bernal unexpectedly suffered a defeat in the semi-finals, the right to the final match fell to China's Zhang Yingda and Portugal's Medina. Both are highly skilled and experienced. The victory will depend on who can maintain a calm will and use their skills in the four matches over the next two days. The first match starts at 5:30 PM today, and the second match starts at 9:30 PM. The competition venue is the International Recreation Club on Jing'an Temple Road. Admission tickets are one yuan per person per match.</p>
<h3>Both Chinese Teams Win in Hong Kong's Uncommon Cup</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 5th Dispatch) On the 5th, Nanhua South defeated the Western team 2-0 in the Uncommon Cup. Zhonghua defeated Hua Sai Si 1-0.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 5th Dispatch) In the Uncommon Cup match on the 5th, Chen Zhenhe participated in Zhonghua's match against Hua Sai Si. The first half ended 0-0. For a long time in the second half, neither side scored. In the final two minutes, Yang Genbao scored a goal. In Nanhua South's match against the Western Association, the South team was strong. Jing Xiang scored first in the first half, and Li Huitang scored again in the second half, winning 2-0. The championship and runner-up positions are now controlled by the South team and Zhonghua.</p>
<h3>The Honor of the Zhonghua Book Company's Jinde Race Walking Team</h3>
<p>In yesterday's 10,000-meter race walking event, the Jinde Athletic Association race walking team, organized by employees of the Zhonghua Book Company, was the strongest team among the participating groups. Moreover, their achievements, considering they are purely workers, are truly commendable. As a result, Mr. Xie Xingdao of the team won the championship with his experienced form, and Mr. Qiu Dechang also came in third. Unexpectedly, they were both disqualified by the referees afterward, citing poor posture. However, they were given separate awards. While the authorities intended to provide encouragement, the referees have their own unique authority, which the competitors must obey. We have long known that Mr. Xie is a long-standing race walking veteran, and Mr. Qiu is also a rising star. Although they were disqualified for "poor posture" in this competition, the true value of their victory has already been determined. Mr. Xie, Mr. Qiu, and the Jinde race walking team should also deeply understand this meaning and find comfort in it.</p>
<h3>World Games Actively Preparing for Tourist Dormitories</h3>
<p>(National News Agency, Berlin, 4th Dispatch) The upcoming World Games will be held here this autumn. It is predicted that a large number of people from all over the world and all parts of Germany will come here to participate in the grand event. In addition to the athletes from various countries, who will be accommodated in the Olympic Village dormitories built by the Organizing Committee, other foreign and out-of-town visitors must be provided with adequate accommodation. The existing major hotels and apartments in Berlin may not be sufficient. Recognizing this, the Organizing Committee has established a special reception division to handle this matter. The initial work of the division has been completed, with 20,000 temporary public dormitories and over 86,000 new bed frames built. However, there is still concern that this may not be enough, so they are continuing to add to and rush the construction day and night.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Basketball Association Concludes</h3>
<p>Fu Jia and Sheng De to Hold Another Final to Determine the Championship</p>
<p>The third Shanghai West Cup Basketball League, which opened more than a month ago, has successfully completed the matches in both the A and B groups. The entire schedule has come to an end. In the A group, Fu Jia and Sheng De both have a record of one loss and several wins, resulting in a tie. A final match is needed to determine who will win the championship. The B group matches were all completed in yesterday's games, with Zhenghua winning the championship with five wins and zero losses, and Zao Yi winning the runner-up position with five losses. (The date for the A group final between Fu Jia and Sheng De will be announced later.) Yesterday's two matches were extremely intense. The results are as follows:</p>
<h3>Kite Competition in Beijing Yesterday</h3>

<h3>A Reporter's Account</h3>
<p>What a coincidence! The Municipal Bureau of Education's 10,000-meter race and the Westerners' Athletic Association's open cross-country race were both held yesterday morning, one in the city center and the other in Jiangwan. I was excited and determined to get up early. Besides covering the news, my only purpose was to breathe in the fresh air of the countryside in the morning. I think the significance of promoting morning sports lies in seizing this precious moment! Unexpectedly, it was also the Qingming Festival - I only realized this later.</p>
<p>"How long has it been since I left this city center!" As my car passed Fudan University and sped towards my destination in the warm morning light, the magnificent fortress - the Municipal Stadium - immediately appeared in my sight again. I couldn't help but exclaim. Last year's National Games was indeed a lively and bustling event, but since then, this is the first time I've seen it again. Such a vast city center, with such a grand Municipal Stadium that boasts to the whole country, has almost been forgotten.</p>
<p>The morning sunlight is particularly bright and tender. This year's spring has been constantly threatened by the excessive cold of winter, and people have been cursing it and not feeling any goodwill towards it. But today, this warm and beautiful spring light, fading and charming, is like a glass of green wine in the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>I arrived at the Municipal Government at 8:45. On the wide and flat road, there were many cars, race walkers, and crowds of people. I found many race officials in the reception room of the Municipal Government and met friends whom I hadn't seen for a long time. One of them immediately used forceful means to pin a "timer" badge on my chest, which made me feel awkward. Well, never mind, this thing won't bother me anyway, and I had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>At 9:20, at the starting point, which was said to be a hundred meters to the right of the Municipal Government, the starter's gun and the stopwatch in my hand went off simultaneously. The officials and the crowd instinctively strolled back to the front of the Municipal Government, waiting; waiting, some looking for something to eat, others speculating about who would be the winner this time. Twenty-odd minutes later, on the distant road to the left of the Municipal Government, a line of cyclists, mixed with race walkers in vests and shorts of various colors, came impressively towards the Municipal Government. This was only half of the entire course, and they still had a big lap to go. When the first person reached the front of the Municipal Government, my watch showed twenty-four minutes and thirty-seven seconds. I could already estimate how long the entire course would take.</p>
<p>Among this group of athletes, there was an elderly man of about fifty years old, named Ge Jingkang. His herringbone-shaped beard was so long that it was spread out above his lips, and the top of his head was somewhat bald. To put it playfully, many of the athletes could be his sons. His body was very thin, but his strength was indeed not bad, which I confirmed after the competition. The posture of those running in the front was always upright and beautiful. The posture of those running in the back looked like they were grabbing something in front of them with both hands, but they could never catch it; some looked like they were pulling a barge on the riverbank, with the upper part of their body stretched forward, and the movement of their hands and feet was out of balance with their body, so they couldn't exert their original strength.</p>
<p>When the second lap came back, Xie Xingdao was indeed the first, which was the correct prediction that everyone had already made. (Unexpectedly, the result was that he was disqualified, which is really strange.) Another first was Wang Shufang, whom I found in the back of the car when I was about to leave the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>After the competition, there were still the awards ceremony and photos; but time did not allow me to wait any longer, so I hurried back to the Hongkou swimming pool on Jiangwan Road.</p>
<p>The surrounding edges of the sky were covered with a hazy mist, the sun had gradually withdrawn its lovely light, and sparse drizzle was falling from time to time. The "bright sun" of the Qingming season suddenly turned into "rainy days".</p>
<p>There were also many crowds in front of the side gate of Hongkou Park, and even more patrolmen and Western and Eastern "Triad Heads" waiting in the middle and on both sides of the road, as if some major emergency was about to occur. It was already 10:45 at this time. According to my estimate, the athletes of this Sino-Western open cross-country race should be struggling on the stone roads and field paths, and soon they would reach the finish line. But to my surprise. When I waited until 11:00, a large group of athletes had just changed their clothes in the side bucket of Hongkou Park and ran out, which meant it hadn't even started yet. Pearceley ordered the players to line up on the road, and the foreign Triad Heads hurriedly stopped the traffic on both ends. After the roll call, Pearceley shouted "Go!" and hundreds of legs "rushed away".</p>
<p>I then asked the driver to immediately drive to the junction of Jiangwan Road and Xiangyin Road to wait, as that was the most important turning point. At 11:20, the first few people appeared from the small path in the field and ran onto Xiangyin Road, and after running a short distance on Jiangwan Road, they turned into East Stadium Road. It was terrible, the athletes didn't have numbers, this list of names couldn't do me any good. To be honest, I only recognized Wang Zhenglin and Zhang Liang, and they had already run to the front. Forget it, there will always be a way when they reach the finish line. So I immediately went back to the finish line.</p>
<p>After all, Wang Zhenglin ran in the front, Wu Wenlin was second, Ling Xuewen was third, Ma Riji was fourth, and Zhang Liang was fifth. The first time was twenty-nine minutes and thirty-four seconds and four tenths, exceeding the previous highest record of thirty minutes and eight seconds. The team championship also belonged to Wang Zhenglin and the other members of the Yi Bing team. (Soul)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Renyi)</p>
<p>"Strive to keep your soul pure and do not lose your innocence; this is the truth." These two sentences are very shallow, damp, and clear. But please think carefully; this is the most difficult "place where truth lies" in the world!</p>
<p>"Thoughts are like hands, they must also be honed." This is what Gorky said. "The more the spirit is used, the more it comes out." This is what Zeng Guofan said. Although the eras and circumstances of great men are different, their views are similar.</p>
<p>"True faith must have true actions." An ideology must have strength in addition to thought and belief in order to have spirit. The difference between faith and doubt is also the difference between practice and hesitation.</p>
<p>"Don't put terror into your soul and be prepared to fight for yourself." This is the only way to find a way out.</p>
<p>"Labor was once a shame, a burden; but now it has become a glorious new cause." The country with the most laborers will be the strongest country in the world.</p>
<p>When we do things, we should "put today under our feet and focus our eyes on the future."</p>
<p>The above are notes that I took while reading, all of which are wise words of great men. Introducing them to the readers of this column can serve as maxims.</p>
<h3>Watching Plum Blossoms by the Canglang Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>"Let's go to the Canglang Pavilion Library to see plum blossoms!" During the plum blossom exhibition from April 1st to 7th, you can hear this call everywhere. The usually quiet Yisanyuanfang area has become crowded with tourists. Tourists can be divided into five categories: those who love gardening go to see the garden plum blossoms, those who love bonsai go to see the bonsai plum blossoms, those who love famous paintings go to see the paintings of plum blossoms, those who love books go to see the plum blossom picture books, and those who love children's works go to see the children's plum blossom exhibition. On the opening day, it rained all day, and there were already hundreds of people braving the rain to attend. On the following sunny day, the number of visitors increased sharply to over a thousand. This humble Mei Xue has previously written twenty or thirty articles in the Spring and Autumn column. Later, due to the heavy workload at the university, I haven't had the leisure to dabble in this writing. This time, I returned home for the spring break and it happened to be the Keyuan Plum Blossom Exhibition. If I, Mei Xue, didn't participate in the plum blossom exhibition, wouldn't I be letting down my own name? Therefore, I spent my whole spring break at the Suzhou Provincial Library. After participating once, I wanted to participate again, just because plum blossoms are my own family. Whether it's garden plum blossoms, bonsai plum blossoms, paintings of plum blossoms, or plum blossom manuals, we were all one family five hundred years ago, and they can all evoke very deep emotions in me. It's only right that I should promote the Keyuan Plum Blossom Exhibition.</p>
<p>In the garden plum blossom section, the iron-boned red plum blossom by the pond can be called the king of plum blossoms. There are four types of bonsai plum blossoms: ancient paintings, recent paintings, modern paintings, and children's paintings. Among the ancient paintings, the albums of Chen Meigong, the vertical scrolls of Jin Dongxin, as well as the works of Bada Shanren, Luo Liangfeng, Tang Yusheng, and others, are all beautiful beyond compare. Particularly noteworthy is the ink plum blossom by Tang Yin, with an inscription by Gao Jiangcun, which is indeed a rare treasure in the recent art world. Recent works include those by Wu Chuangzhai, Gu Heyi, Jin Xinlan, Ni Mogeng, and others. Modern works include those by Ye Yuhu, Zhang Daqian, Wu Hufan, and others. The broken branches of flowers painted by Mei Lanfang also received much attention from visitors. The children's plum blossom exhibition features genuine children's drawings. Other manuals related to plum blossoms are displayed in glass cases, making it inconvenient to browse through them. I can only look at the titles and practice "stopping thirst by thinking of plums".</p>
<h3>Spring Melody</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Sow a single millet seed in spring, and reap ten thousand grains in autumn. This, though a fundamental law of biology, allows us to glimpse the various sorrows of autumn, for a seed has already been sown in the spring.</p>
<p>In spring, it is said that everyone's blood flows faster, so by spring, everyone feels physically tired; this is "spring fatigue." When people feel tired, they can't seem to muster any energy, and this is followed by "spring sleep." Only the most enlightened are free from dreams, but ordinary people cannot avoid dreaming, so once they enter the land of sleep, they cannot help but have "spring dreams." These are the three movements of spring. But who knows when these swaying spring dreams will end? And one fears that when one awakens, though the flowers may not have withered and the birds ceased singing, thick shade will have already covered the earth, and the scenery will have changed completely.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, spring seems to be the most worthy of appreciation and remembrance, because in the bright spring light, it is both warm and pleasing to the eye to take the reins and go on an outing to the countryside. However, at the same time, I find this spring to be the most miserable, because in the spring, either it doesn't rain, or once it does, it will rain continuously without stopping. Waking up in the middle of the night, listening to the dripping eaves, draws out worries and sorrows, again and again, and one is bound to be unable to close one's eyes for half the night. As the saying goes, "An inch of spring night is worth an ounce of gold," which is fitting to describe this situation.</p>
<p>"I sleep unaware of the dawn in spring, everywhere I hear birds singing. Last night came the sound of wind and rain, I wonder how many flowers have fallen." This ancient Tang poem seems to merely express deep worries. But in recent years, every time I recite it, it adds another layer of sadness for the fate of the country, and I feel that it is better to pluck the flower when it blooms and enjoy the present.</p>
<p>However, although there are aspects of spring that can be cursed, overall, it is still a season worthy of praise, because in the spring, everything still has some vitality. Poets' stomachs full of complaints can always be expressed in timely poems. Wine drinkers can exchange their leather coats for cotton coats, and then cotton coats for lined coats, and still have some money left over to buy a drunk. As for the farmers, naturally, they will not lightly let spring pass, because this is the most suitable time to sow hope.</p>
<h3>He Tianjian's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wannan Jiangyi</p>
<p>Modern painters like to honor themselves with lofty titles, calling themselves master, elder, or saint, but my friend He Tianjian is different. He says that since ancient times, no one has called themselves saint, elder, or master. Art should be approached practically, without regard for fame or profit. Modern painters like to boast of originality, but He Tianjian says that originality must come from ancient methods to be true originality. To create a method without knowing the ancient methods is nothing more than wild fox Zen, and even after racking one's brains, one may not reach one ten-thousandth of the ancients' achievement. This is still the better case; more often, they invoke originality, but their paintings become less original, and they appropriate ancient printed works as their own to deceive the world. So, what about He Tianjian's paintings? I have seen the paintings in this upcoming exhibition. Most of them use famous scenic spots in Jiangsu and Zhejiang as materials, such as Yandang Mountain, Xianxia Ridge, Five Waterfalls, Tai Lake, and Mount Emei and Golden Summit in Shu. He captures and expresses their essence, and his methods draw from the strengths of the Five Dynasties and Two Song periods to create his own style. This is true originality. I do not like exaggeration. By viewing his exhibition, one knows that my words are not false. He Tianjian does not like fame, but fame comes to him. Not only in the country, but also overseas in Japan, Taiwan, and Siam, his name is known, and they pay handsomely for his paintings. He Tianjian does not like profit, but his paintings sell for a thousand gold, and people spend it willingly, cherishing his paintings. He Tianjian makes a living by selling paintings, and he is always happy and content.

<h3>After Reading "From Zhaoguan to Huansha Creek"</h3>
<p>— Dixiu Zhi</p>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, this column published Mr. Zhan Ruoye's article "From Zhaoguan to Huansha Creek," which contains many inaccuracies. Liyang (not "Liyang," nor is it called He County, but there is an old county village about seven li from Huansha Creek, which Mr. Zhan Ruoye may have mistaken.) is the author's hometown, and Huansha Creek is less than two li from the author's home; therefore, I will record the situation of the creek in writing to inform the readers.</p>
<p>The Huansha Shrine is located two li outside the North Gate of Nanduzhen in Liyang, by the big river. Near the shrine, there is still the tomb of the woman who washed silk, along with her clothing and quilts. The big river was anciently called the Lai River, which is now Huansha Creek. There is a large bridge in front of the shrine, and to the right is a Lai River Nunnery, but it is dilapidated and only serves as a place for farmers to rest. The Huansha Shrine still has over ten mu of shrine land, used for spring and autumn sacrifices and to repair the shrine, so it is still relatively intact. According to research, the woman who washed silk was named Shi, and the management of the Huansha Shrine is entirely in the hands of the Shi family descendants. The shrine is located in a remote area, and few people from afar knew about it before. Since the opening of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the place has become an important thoroughfare, and more and more people have heard of it and come to visit. The central government recently issued a clear order to preserve historical sites, and it seems necessary for the local government to directly manage and repair this kind of ancient shrine and tomb, which are of great historical value.</p>
<h3>A Switched Nest of Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near the Double Ninth Festival, Seeking Serenity in a Small Gathering, Reminiscing Old Dreams in Linked Pearls, Lamenting a Thousand Autumns</p>
<p>Along a long corridor, there was a row of red swastika-shaped racks and flower stands of various sizes. Various bonsai plants, matched with plump or slender chrysanthemums, created a very elegant and appropriate atmosphere. I repeatedly said, "Very good! Very good!" Lan Chang looked around and said with a smile, "All my life's efforts are here." As he spoke, he led me into a living room next to it. There were already five or six guests, old and young, sitting on several low soft chairs and brocade stools. Lan Chang rushed to introduce me to a novelist, two poets, two painters, and an old lyricist. I was very happy to meet them. In particular, Fang Dabai, the novelist, was someone I had admired for over a decade. So, after everyone shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, we were very happy. It seemed that the guests Lan Chang invited were not limited to the few in this room. As he spoke, he went to another room to greet them. The novelist Fang Dabai and I got along very well, so he led me out to see Lan Chang's garden. Only when we walked to the long corridor did I notice the bonsai plants on the swastika racks. The pots were the size of dippers, some were shaped like incense burners, and some were cylindrical. They were planted with evergreen pines and cypresses, bird-perch trees, June snows, and various small tree stumps. Below were various exposed live tree roots, acting as small pot stands to support them. On these stands were also arranged cattails, colorful stones, small Taihu stones, and various small trinkets. I said to the novelist, "These trinkets are just wood and stones and are not worth much money, but each one is arranged with a sense of artistic design. It must have taken him a lot of effort." The novelist said, "Life in this world, of course, requires doing some work, but also requires finding some entertainment. Lan Chang is a well-known Mr. Nice Guy. He doesn't gamble or visit prostitutes, and he's not even very interested in watching plays or movies, let alone modern things like dancing." But when he was young, he had some romantic experiences. Now that he's in middle age, he has to have something to rely on, so he pours his feelings into flowers and birds, to regulate his dry life." As we spoke, I saw on the rack a foot-and-a-half-wide treasure-blue porcelain plate, holding a large silver winter melon. I asked with a smile, "Is Lan Chang's family as complete as this melon?" Dabai nodded and said, "Yes! This round melon is enough to symbolize his family." I said that Lan Chang's romance was just a thing of the past, and now only a little regret remains. I said, "Life doesn't have to be too perfect. Too perfect will be envied. It's better to leave a little regret to remember for the rest of your life and to be mourned by others after a hundred years." As we spoke, we walked down the steps. Here was a long courtyard. Besides a few trees in the center of the yard, there was a low stone flower bed on both sides, leaning against a square-grid flower fence. The flower bed was full of clumps of old green leaves. Dabai said, "Do you recognize what flower this is?" I saw that the flower's stem looked somewhat like an herb, and on the stem grew round leaves. The leaves were thick, and because it was late autumn, the tips of the leaves were a bit purple. I shook my head and said, "It looks very unfamiliar. I really can't tell what flower this is."

<h3>Vulgarization</h3>
<p>— (Jun Yi)</p>
<p>Academic thought is the public property of the world, and must be spread among the people to be appreciated by both the elegant and the vulgar. However, after years of transmission, it loses its true original meaning.</p>
<p>After Lao-ism went through vulgarization, the result became Taoists in White Cloud Temple swindling copper coins by meditation.</p>
<p>After Yijing went through vulgarization, the result became street stalls and fortune-tellers making a living.</p>
<p>After Buddhism went through vulgarization, the result became matchmakers praying for wealth and children, and bald, fat-headed stupid monks.</p>
<p>Applying idealistic scholarship to a materialistic life, this is probably the extraordinary cleverness of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Wu Meicun</h3>
<p>— Cai Zhecun</p>
<p>People of the upper classes in the Three Dynasties suffered from a love of fame, while people of the lower classes suffered from a lack of love of fame. If a person loves fame, he will be careful about anything that damages his reputation and will not turn his back on it. If a person does not love fame, he will not only be reckless and unrestrained, but he can also calmly accept the shame of humiliating the country. Wu Sangui forgot the great feud of his lord and father and surrendered to the barbarians. He was unworthy of being blamed. One day, I read Mr. Wu Meicun's poem "Yuan Yuan Song" (Yuan Yuan was the name of Sangui's concubine, whose surname was Chen). It said: "Weeping bitterly, the six armies all wear white mourning clothes, in a rage he raised his troops all for the sake of beauty." It also said: "How can wives and children be related to great plans? Heroes are helpless for love." "The whole family's white bones have turned to ash, but the beauty's red makeup shines on the historical record." After Sangui read it, sweat poured down his back, and he was ashamed and almost wanted to hide. He secretly sent an official with ten thousand gold to visit Meicun, asking him to delete and revise these lines. However, Meicun neither accepted the gold nor changed the poem. This is why he is a poet-historian.</p>
<h3>At the Bodybuilding Competition</h3>
<p>A: What's with those two bras? We can't see her chest is beautiful.</p>
<p>B: And that... that thing down there...</p>
<h3>A Correction to "Yan Yu"</h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>"Yan Yu" means "common saying," and is generally understood as sayings that are popular among the people. These sayings are the words of our ancestors or of recent people based on various facts and experiences in life! Therefore, they can be widely circulated and passed down through the ages.</p>
<p>However, some proverbs, due to the passage of time and erroneous transmission, have lost their original meaning, or even become the opposite of their original meaning, and are therefore no longer beneficial to the world, or even harmful.</p>
<p>For example, "Ears are not picked, they will not become deaf; eyes are not treated, they will not become blind." Who doesn't recite these two sentences fluently? In my opinion, they are very wrong. Think about it, ears full of earwax are the cause of disease, and removing it can prevent deafness. How can it cause deafness? If the eyes have problems and are not treated, how can they not become blind? Therefore, I think there must be two words with the same sound but different meanings in these two sentences that have been misunderstood. After careful thought, I have it! Replace them with two homophones that are correct in meaning, and correct them as follows: "Ears not picked will certainly become deaf, eyes not treated will certainly become blind."</p>
<h3>Blackboard and Whiteboard</h3>
<p>— (Yang Yusheng)</p>
<p>A certain teacher was addicted to gambling, and people called him "Doctor" without using his name. However, every time he gambled, he lost deeply and often regretted it. He often said to people, "From tomorrow on, I will wash my hands of it!" However, he still gambled as before, and he still lost as before. Someone joked to him, "You can be said to get it from the blackboard and send it to the whiteboard!"</p>

<h3>A Word for the Chinese Land Administration Society</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>——Hopes for the Third Annual Meeting——</p>
<p>The Chinese Land Administration Society is holding its third annual meeting in Hangzhou, and it has been three days now. The land problem is the primary problem in today's Chinese agricultural problem, and the society is the highest academic institution for studying the Chinese land problem. Its members are spread throughout the country, and most of the central and local land administration agencies are also group members of the society. Now, it is not accidental that experts from all over the country have gathered to discuss matters on the shores of West Lake, surrounded by lush greenery, and are admired by all.</p>
<p>The unequal distribution of land in our country is the source of rural unrest today. Recent statistics from various sources prove that landlords hold almost half of the cultivated land in the country, and tenants pay more than 200 million yuan in field rent every year. Farmers work hard all year round, but cannot afford a pair of shoes, so those who take risks are everywhere. This is one reason why the land problem urgently needs to be resolved. The dispersed use of land in our country hinders the progress of production technology. According to recent statistics from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, small-scale operations of less than 20 mu account for 48.6% in the North China provinces; in the South China provinces, operations of less than 10 mu account for 59.5%. These small farms are difficult to fully utilize human and animal power, let alone machinery; the resulting harvest cannot compete with advanced countries in the market. This is the second reason why the land problem urgently needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>The Chinese Land Administration Society aims to "study land problems and promote land reform," and has been working hard for three years. "The first year focused on pure theoretical research, concentrating on introducing the basic theories of land reform, discussing the principles of land policy, and the relationship between rural revival and land problems. The second year gradually progressed to the study of specific land problems in China and the introduction of policies from Europe and the West, focusing on the review of land administration in various provinces and cities. The third year will further advance to the study of land laws and regulations, land finance, the rental system, and the field tax problem" (see "The Chinese Land Administration Society and the Chinese Reform Movement" by Mr. Ye Zheng, Director of General Affairs of the Society). Step by step, it has progressed from theory to the implementation stage; its efforts are admired by us, and its influence is not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese land problem has not been resolved at all, which is undeniable. Since the National Government established its capital, the talented people of the Party-state have been eager to implement the Principle of Equalization of Land Ownership formulated by Sun Yat-sen, but after nine years, it seems that they have not been able to remove the various obstacles to implementation. The ultimate goal of Equalization of Land Ownership is not to reorganize land, but to thoroughly reform the land system, that is, "land to the tiller." This reform is for the benefit of the entire nation, but it is still bound to be opposed by a few local tyrants. Therefore, Equalization of Land Ownership is not only a legal issue, but also a power issue; that is, how to support farmers and eradicate local tyrants so that the Equalization of Land Ownership policy can be implemented smoothly. The Chinese Land Administration Society has studied the history of land reform in various countries and the land administration situation in various provinces in the past to formulate sound laws and regulations and strive for convenience in implementation. It is hoped that in the future, it will pay more attention to the organization and training of farmers and establish contact with social education institutions. This is the first thing we hope from the gentlemen of the conference.</p>
<p>The reform of the land system cannot be accomplished "overnight." Before "land to the tiller" is realized, it seems that we should try to reduce the burden on landless farmers. Before the Northern Expedition of the National Government, the 25% rent reduction was the primary task to solve the peasant problem; to this day, the principle of 25% rent reduction is still fully included in the land laws and regulations of the central government and various provinces. However, as far as the editor knows, only Zhejiang Province can effectively implement the 25% rent reduction policy throughout the country; even in Zhejiang, it is still affected by the environment and cannot be promoted universally. The implementation experience of the 25% rent reduction policy further shows us that any land reform policy cannot be completed by local gentry and landlords. The transformation of the rent reduction regulations into rent increase regulations by the landlords of Pinghu (see "The Rent System and 25% Rent Reduction in Pinghu" by Wu Xiaochen, Eastern Miscellany, Volume 34, Issue 24) is one example. The Chinese Land Administration Society has stipulated that "rental issues" and "aerial surveying" will be the scope of discussion at this year's annual meeting, and the meeting will be held in Zhejiang Province, which has been most successful in promoting the 25% rent reduction policy. It is hoped that a thorough study will be conducted on the promotion process of the 25% rent reduction policy and the reasons for its failure, and that effective measures will be proposed and submitted to the central government and various provincial governments for adoption and implementation. This is the second thing we hope from the gentlemen of the conference.</p>
<p>In addition to solving the land distribution problem, we should also solve the land use problem. If "land to the tiller" cannot be complemented by a collective farming system, agricultural technology cannot be improved, and it will inevitably be eliminated by international competition. The rural cooperative movement in our country is still mostly limited to credit and marketing; as for the organization of cooperative farms, there are still many difficulties. Mr. Zhu Ping proposed in his book "Land Control" to implement collectivization through cooperative methods to improve the economic use of land. The Chinese Land Administration Society should actively study and discuss this in light of national conditions, so as to thoroughly solve the land problem in our country. This is the third thing we hope from the gentlemen of the conference.</p>
<p>The above three points should be what the gentlemen of the conference have been deeply considering for three years. Taking this opportunity, I would like to briefly express my humble opinion and wish the Chinese Land Administration Society unlimited progress.</p>
<h3>An Examination of the Reasons for Fragmented Cultivated Land in China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Pijie</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of fragmented cultivated land is extremely common in China's agricultural areas, and it has in fact become the most difficult and serious problem to solve in China's agricultural policy; however, it has not yet aroused deep attention from the Chinese people. According to the author's research (see the 71st issue of the *Land Administration Weekly*), the definition of land fragmentation encompasses two phenomena: the first is related to agricultural policy, that is, agricultural land is divided into too many and too small operating units, and their weak economic strength is insufficient to realize the mission of agriculture in the national economy; the second is related to agricultural technology, that is, the land parcels owned by an agricultural operating unit are scattered, small, and not contiguous, making it impossible to apply new and advanced agricultural techniques. Based on this definition, if we observe the current situation of Chinese agriculture, we will definitely arrive at a result that surprises us: most of China's cultivated land has fallen into a state of division and fragmentation!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the reasons for the occurrence of fragmented land in China can be divided into two major categories: north of the Yangtze River, most of the land is cultivated by owner-farmers, while south of the Yangtze River, most of the land is cultivated by tenant farmers. In many places, these two phenomena are equally important, while in many other places, one waxes and the other wanes. However, the results are invariably the same, that is, in terms of technology, it creates a so-called "Gemengelage" (mixed plot) state, and in terms of economics, it forms countless small farms with insufficient survival ability and weak resistance. The disadvantage of this situation for farmers need not be discussed further. What I want to study here are the reasons for the occurrence of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The reasons for the phenomenon of fragmented cultivated land are of two kinds: direct and indirect. The so-called direct causes are the result of the functioning of social organizations and social systems, while the so-called indirect causes are not related to social systems and may occur in any society. The following will discuss them separately.</p>
<p>There are three direct causes of cultivated land fragmentation: first, the system of inheritance by multiple sons; second, freedom of land transactions; and third, the formation of large private landholdings. All three are the inevitable result of the continued functioning of Chinese social organizations and social systems for thousands of years, and their impact has led to the phenomenon of cultivated land fragmentation.</p>
<p>Inheritance by Multiple Sons　After the death of the owner of land and other property, the system whereby all property is inherited by one of the children is called the system of inheritance by a single son; conversely, the system whereby all children have equal rights and are divided equally is called the system of inheritance by multiple sons. China's system of inheritance by multiple sons has been in place for a long time. It has been implemented since the establishment of the private land ownership system and has never been changed. However, the so-called system of inheritance by multiple sons is actually an incomplete form in China. This is because only men have the right to inherit, while women have never been qualified to participate. Although the new civil law grants women equal rights, it has not yet been widely implemented in practice.</p>
<p>Why is the system of inheritance by multiple sons a direct cause of cultivated land fragmentation? Suppose a farmer A in Jiangsu has 200 mu of cultivated land, which is not a small amount. Let us assume that A has four children, B, C, D, and E, which is not a large number in an ordinary rural village. According to the system of inheritance by multiple sons, when A dies, the land will be divided equally into four parts, and his children B, etc., will each receive 50 mu of inheritance. It is still possible to maintain the livelihood of a family of eight with 50 mu of land. If each of the children of B, etc., has four children, then after the death of B, etc., the original 200 mu will be divided into sixteen parts, and each of A's grandchildren will receive only a little over 12.5 mu. Thus, an above-average farm will become an undersized farm unit in less than three generations. Over generations, dividing and dividing again, the final result of any farm is to fall into fragmentation. "There is no sky that does not change in five days, and there is no business that does not fail in five generations." Those in the West who practice inheritance by a single son have what is called a "farm family" (Baueruedei), which often maintains the old business for hundreds of years, making the scale larger and the foundation more solid, creating a central force in agricultural society. This kind of situation is probably beyond our dreams under the widespread implementation of the system of inheritance by multiple sons in our country.</p>
<p>Freedom of Land Transactions　Under the private land ownership system, freedom of land transactions is a natural phenomenon. Landowners are protected by law and have the right to freely dispose of their land, freely divide it, freely incur debts, and freely buy and sell it. In the past, China has not restricted free transactions. Although officials were sometimes prohibited from openly operating real estate, the restriction was contrary to the facts. Those who made large-scale land transactions have always been officials in the court or people related to them. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not changed to this day.</p>
<p>Why is freedom of land transactions sufficient to cause cultivated land fragmentation? The process of freedom of land transactions is as follows: on the one hand, cultivated land is concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords, forming a state of "fields linked by thousands of paths" for the rich. On the other hand, the scope of farmers' land is reduced, gradually falling below the subsistence level. Most of the land of the large landlords is subleased to several small tenants in a "piece-rent" style, so that the income of each household is similar to that of farmers with reduced scope.</p>
<p>Originally, since it is said that land transactions are free, why don't farmers use this freedom? Either they don't sell their land to maintain their farms, or they compete with large landlords to buy land to expand their operating units? However, in reality, the so-called freedom of land transactions is purely a one-sided freedom. Under continuous oppression and exploitation, farmers are either too heavily in debt or have no way to make a living, so they "have to" sell their land. In a society where rural financial organizations are underdeveloped and usury is rampant, even if they want to buy a small amount of land, they have no liquid capital to inject. Thus, the use of freedom is purely the one-sided right of a few powerful people.</p>
<p>The Creation of Large Private Landholdings. China has implemented a universal system of inheritance by multiple sons, and in principle, the phenomenon of land division and fragmentation is unavoidable, and the area of agricultural units should be universally small. However, why are large private landholdings created at the same time? Isn't this a contradiction? However, according to actual investigations, it has been proven that there are indeed many excessively large landlords in China—especially south of the Yangtze River. The emergence of such landlords is roughly due to the following reasons:　Tax reasons:　In the past, high-ranking officials such as Li Hongzhang once seized large amounts of land by virtue of their status and left it to their descendants. Because the time has not been too long, although it has been divided, the hundred-legged worm dies but does not collapse, and it still maintains this large scale.　The emerging politicians and warlords, relying on their power and resources, continue to purchase land. For example, Wang Zhanyuan was only a second-rate figure among the old warlords, but his land stretched from Hankou to Dagu, and was continuous along the way. All the land boundary stones were marked with "Nanguan Fuwang," indicating that it was all his land.　Merchants who also engaged in land management invested part of their capital in rural areas to purchase large tracts of farmland. Because the years of drought were too severe and land prices plummeted, this kind of speculation was very active.</p>
<p>The impact of large private landholdings on land fragmentation is the same as the freedom of land transactions in the previous section, but its effect is even further. Wherever there are large private landholdings, a part of the farmers must be oppressed to the point of bankruptcy and become the agricultural proletariat. If they are unwilling to starve to death, they must become tenants of the large landlords, operating a small amount of land and using the harvest of their blood and sweat to satisfy their harsh demands. Most European and American landlords personally manage their agriculture, because their vision is far-reaching and their capital is abundant, they often become advanced farms with good scale. As for Chinese landlords, they do not engage in management and are merely parasites on the national economy.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>There are two indirect causes of cultivated land fragmentation: first, the excess of agricultural population; second, China's village system.</p>
<p>Excess Agricultural Population. The author does not want to discuss the phenomenon of excess population in China today. However, the excess of population in agriculture is an undeniable fact. There are three aspects to the phenomenon of excess agricultural population:　From the perspective of the entire national economy, China's agricultural economy is still the main body of the national economy, and more than 80% of the population lives in the fields. Other parts of the national economy, such as industry, commerce, and transportation, are not developed. Therefore, due to the unsoundness of this national economic structure, 80% of the population is concentrated in agriculture.　In terms of agriculture, China's agricultural areas are limited to the coastal and central provinces, accounting for only one-third of the country's total area. Therefore, 80% of China's population is concentrated in a small part of the country's land.　In terms of the internal organization of agriculture, China's agricultural production focuses on primitive grain production, and there is little sideline business to speak of, except in a few places. Therefore, 80% of the population lives in one-third of the country's land, and is concentrated in the simplest land production. Then, the undeniable fact of excess agricultural population is obviously the most unfavorable economic phenomenon.</p>
<p>Due to the prevalence of the system of inheritance by multiple sons, this excess population has the opportunity to obtain land equally. As a result, the more people there are, the less the average income per person is, and the more fragmented the cultivated land is. "Where there is land, there are people; where there are people, there is division." We can add: "Where there are many people, there is little land; where there are many divisions, there is fragmentation."</p>
<p>(II) China's Village System. When any ethnic group initially occupies a part of the earth's surface, there is a form of residence. Nomadic peoples use impermanent tent-style dwellings and live by moving with the water and grass. Agricultural peoples adopt a settled style, either forming a clan, which is the origin of the village, or living scattered on the land they own, which is the single-household system. China is a country where the village is the norm and the single-household system is the exception. Thousands of years of evolution have made the village organization increasingly strict, and the scope has expanded. The instability of politics has made it impossible for small villages to support themselves, so they began to merge, making the larger ones even larger. As for ethics, morality, and religion, they also advocate clan cohabitation, creating the basis for settlement. From south to north and from east to west, China universally practices the large village system. With the density of the population, the distance between villages is getting smaller and smaller. Although there are no statistics on the land area occupied by each village, it can be asserted that the number must be large.</p>
<p>Why is the village system a cause of land fragmentation? Since farmers live together in villages, their land must be scattered around the village. This is the biggest difference from the single-household system, that is, under the single-household system, farms and residences are mostly in one place, and the cultivated land is just outside the door. There is less travel, time is saved, work is convenient, and supervision is easy. Under the village system, farmers live in the center of the village, and the distance to the land is very large. Most villages also build enclosures for security needs, leaving only a few doors for people to enter and exit. Therefore, any land that is not suitable to be outside the door must be detoured, which takes more time. The larger the village, the more obvious this situation becomes. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, Munzinger studied the time wasted under the village system in southern Germany and found that it accounted for 30% of the working time, which is shocking. If fragmented cultivated land is near the residence, farmers still have the opportunity to gradually merge it into a meaningful and rational connection; now, with village roads obstructing it, farmers feel inconvenienced but have no way to remedy it. Land A may be near the village, but the location of Land B must be isolated. Moreover, most small pieces of land are scattered in the east and west and have no access roads. If you want to reach the workplace, you must pass through the neighbor's land, so the trampling of people and animals is an unavoidable damage. 　　The situation of scattered and fragmented cultivated land in China is very common, and the reasons are as described above. Anyone who has personally experienced it or paid attention to agricultural technology can realize that the harm of this bad phenomenon is endless.</p>
<h3>Implementing Planned Economy and "Land Control"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ping</p>
<p>I. The Meaning of Planned Economy</p>
<p>The fences of laissez-faire capitalist economy have been destroyed by the flood of economic panic, and economic panic will become the death knell of capitalist economy; due to the increasing decline of capitalist economy, planned economy has risen in its place. Planned economy is an organized and planned economic system, which is very different from the anarchic and unorganized economic system of capitalist economy. Capitalist production behavior is based on personal profit, and is dominated by the blind law of market supply and demand, which inevitably leads to periodic economic panic, and the capitalist economic system that digs its own grave will be buried here. The production principle of planned economy is based on social welfare. In order to meet the reasonable needs of the people, it can eliminate the economic contradictions and economic panic under the capitalist system, and is the most reasonable economic system for social and economic development to the present stage. Recently, general scholars often mention planned economy and controlled economy side by side, and confuse planned economy with controlled economy. Some even say that planned economy is the ideal of controlled economy, and controlled economy is the implementation of planned economy. There are various opinions, and no one knows what is right or wrong. However, it is not known that planned economy and controlled economy are similar in form, but are essentially different. The distinction between planned and controlled economy is explained below:</p>
<p>The Distinction between Planned Economy and Controlled Economy　Planned economy is a positive economic policy, a new and rational economic form. To implement planned economy, the entire national economy, such as production, exchange, distribution, and consumption, must be made into a precise plan that is interrelated. This plan is centrally controlled by the government, so that national economic activities become an organic structure. In countries that implement planned economy, the direction of the national economy takes planning as the body and control as the use, and uses the means of control to achieve the purpose of planning. As for controlled economy, it is a negative economic policy. It is a remedial method produced by countries where capitalism has reached the final stage in order to resolve the inevitable contradictions of economic development. Therefore, in essence, it is fundamentally different from planned economy.</p>
<p>What China Needs is Planned Economy　China's economic development has not yet reached the level of modern capitalist countries. At the same time, the economic power of imperialism is shrouded in our entire national economy, making us groan under the shackles of foreign capitalism and unable to break free. We have nothing to cherish for the original economic system, and there is no need to maintain it or save it. We must break through the shackles of the old system to find a way out. Therefore, we do not need a negative and repair-style controlled economy to maintain this old economic system, but a positive and creative planned economic system based on the needs of the national environment, a three-people's economic policy, standing on the equal position of the entire national economy, seeking the development of the national economy, and implementing a planned economic system that is both democratic and equitable. On the one hand, economic construction has centralized control, and planned advancement enables production to be rationally and rapidly developed; on the other hand, the results of production are not subject to the domination and monopoly of a few people, and can be enjoyed fairly in distribution. For the sake of prospering China's economy, and for solving China's livelihood problems, there is no other way but to implement a planned economy.</p>
<p>II. The Status of Land Issues in the Planned Economy</p>
<p>What China needs now is a planned economy, which has been briefly explained above. Now, let's look at the relationship between the planned economy and land issues. Under the planned economy, the basic sectors of the national economy, such as industrial agricultural trade and transportation, must be systematically linked and statistically planned. However, all economic activities are inseparable from land, so to control human economic activities, it is necessary to control land. The land issue is a basic issue of the planned economy. If the land issue is not properly resolved, the planned economy cannot develop on the right track. Therefore, the planned economy and the land issue have a close relationship.</p>
<p>(I) The Relationship between Land and Social Economy　Land is the basic condition for human survival and the source of social production. Human survival depends on economy, and the origin of economy is due to land. Whether it is the economic life of an individual or a society, if it is separated from land, it will lose its foundation. All kinds of relationships in the social economy originate from land. The development and illness of the social economy are judged by whether the distribution and utilization of land are appropriate. The consumer goods such as clothing, food, and housing on which human beings depend for survival are all produced from land. If the use of land hinders the public welfare of mankind, or if land is monopolized by a few people, it will directly affect the development of the social economy. Since the development of the social economy is hindered, human survival will be flawed, and social unrest and disputes will arise. The essence of land and social economy, please explain further:</p>
<p>(A) Land is the Basic Behavior of Production Factors and Economic Activities as Production. Without production, there will be no consumer goods such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Without consumer goods, there will be no social and economic activities at all, and human needs cannot be supplied. The elements of production are divided into three types: land, capital, and labor. This element is the first to be used for land. To achieve the goal of production, the above three production tools must be prepared. If one is missing, production cannot be established. In the past, when industry and commerce were not developed, human beings lived directly on land, and the relationship with land was even closer. Until modern science flourished and industry and commerce advanced, land seemed to have no direct relationship on the surface, but on closer inspection, land has an inseparable effect. If industry is separated from land, it will lose all supply of raw materials, and the supply of workers will lose its source. If commerce is separated from land, there will be no exchange of goods and circulation of commodities. It can be seen that land is not only a factor of production, but also the source of all social and economic activities.</p>
<p>(B) To Develop the Economy, We Must First Control the Economy　Since land is a factor of production, and production is the origin of economy, to increase production, we should first solve the main problems in production: on the one hand, we must concentrate a large amount of funds, strive for production and construction, attract a large number of workers, and promote production efficiency; on the other hand, the solution of land issues, and the increase of the productive force of land itself, is also an urgent task for developing the economic productivity of society. Therefore, to develop economic construction, increase productivity, and control land to solve land problems, is the prerequisite. The emergence of land problems is caused by the monopoly of land by a few people, which makes the source of public welfare of society turn from social public ownership to private exclusive enjoyment. Therefore, the abandonment of land utilization and the abandonment of land resources have become an inevitable phenomenon. The distorted development of the social economy is due to the serious situation of land problems, advancing in the same direction. Now, the way to control land should stand on the position of social public welfare, and make the ownership and use rights of land public to the society, in order to achieve the goal of maximizing the benefits of land.</p>
<p>(C) The Relationship between Planned Economy and Land Issues　The prerequisite for implementing a planned economy is that there must be a centralized government to have the power to promote it; second, production organizations and producers must have a strict organization to have the possibility of planning and control; third, there must be accurate investigation and statistics on the existing economic situation, so that the plans can be put into practice. In addition, there must be an important condition, that is, the fourth control of production factors - such as land, labor, and capital. If the land system is not sound, such as unequal distribution or improper use, or a large amount of land rights are monopolized by a few private individuals, then the planned economy will not be able to be implemented at all. Therefore, to implement a planned economy, we should solve the land issue first. To solve the land issue is the premise for implementing a planned economy:</p>
<p>(A) The Importance of Land Issues in Planned Economy　Planned economy forms the entire national economy into a planned structure. Land is an important component of the planned economy's mechanism. If the land system becomes pathological, it will affect the unsoundness of the national economy, and the promotion of the planned economy will be hindered. If land issues can be properly resolved under the planned economy, the economic plans of all agricultural and industrial sectors can be smoothly promoted. Therefore, if we want to promote a planned economy, we should first solve the land issue. After the land issue is resolved, the important production tools in the planned economy can be solved accordingly. The importance of land issues in the planned economy can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(B) Land Policy of the Planned Economy　Since land issues are so important in the planned economy, the land policy of the planned economy is of course the basic policy that determines various economic policies in the planned economy. The principle of the land policy of the planned economy is to enable people who need land to have the opportunity to obtain land, and the natural benefits of land should belong to the entire society. At the same time, the use and distribution of all land should be carried out rationally under the entire plan.</p>
<p>III. Implementing Planned Economy and "Land Control"</p>
<p>There is no doubt that China's economic construction should implement a planned economy, and it is also clear that the thorough solution of land issues is a pressing prerequisite for implementing a planned economy. However, how to establish the land policy for implementing the economic plan remains to be discussed. In general, the occurrence of land problems is due to the anarchic, blind, and distorted development of land ownership and use. The crux of China's land problems at present lies in this. The unreasonable distribution and uneconomical use of land in China are well-known facts. The unrest in China's rural society is also the biggest reason. How to resolve the contradiction between land ownership and use is the main content of the current land issue. The way to solve this contradiction should be based on the principle of equalizing land rights and implementing "land control" according to the needs of the entire economic plan.</p>
<p>The principles for implementing "land control" are as follows:</p>
<p>I. Public land originally under the custody of various administrative agencies should be centrally managed by the land administration agency immediately for overall planning.</p>
<p>II. Land managed by local public organizations should be taken over by the competent land administration agency and utilized in accordance with the provisions of the entire economic construction plan, and the proceeds from the use of such land, originally used for local public undertakings, should still be allocated as before;</p>
<p>III. Land managed by temples and private organizations should be supervised and reorganized by the competent land administration agency, and utilization should be promoted to increase production and eliminate waste;</p>
<p>IV. Private land should be supervised and guided by the land administration agency under the principle of the entire economic construction, and collectivization should be implemented in a cooperative manner to adjust its ownership relations and improve its economic use;</p>
<p>V. All municipal land, forest land, mines, water sources, fishing land, pasture land, salt pan land, and other public land should be taken over and managed by the competent land administration agency, and allocated or leased to various institutions, organizations, or private individuals for utilization in accordance with the provisions of the entire economic construction plan.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>The above sections are only a brief summary, but if we want to solve the land issue, establish a sound land system, and implement a planned economy, then "land control" is a necessary prerequisite. The call for a planned economy in our country has been very loud, but the conditions for implementing a planned economy have not yet been met. Since the implementation of the "currency management" system, the conditions for a planned economy in the financial system have been roughly prepared. If we can also implement control over other production factors - land and labor - that is, implement "land control" and "labor control," then the implementation of a planned economy and the prosperity of the national economy may be possible!</p>
<p>The Land Administration Society will hold a meeting in Hangzhou this issue, and this journal will publish articles on land administration. The article "An Examination of the International Capital Market," which was not fully published in the previous issue, will be published in the next issue. This is hereby stated. 　　Liu Tang</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>To Messrs. Yu Xuan, Jiang Yusheng, Xie Juzeng, Wang Naigeng, Mo Yan, Wei Youfei, Wei Yuan, He Boxiong, Zhang Mengzhao, and others: Your manuscript fees for March have been settled. Please collect them from the accounting department of this office from the 6th to the 10th of this month, between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM daily, upon presentation of the remuneration slip sent by this department. Sincerely, the Economic Special Issue Editorial Department.</p>
<h3>Finance: Observations on the Settling of Long-Term Loans at the End of April</h3>
<p>In the financial industry, the practice of granting long-term loans with an annual rate of one or ten percent as the sole standard term, the settlement of long-term loans at the end of April this year is imminent. Because very few new ten-percent loans were made last autumn, although there are many rollover accounts, due to the difficult times, there is still no "rice to cook." According to those in the industry, it is virtually impossible to clear all the payments on the 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and 30th—the six major settlement dates. It is also difficult to gather the amount of money released. Therefore, the Ningbo banks only accept long-term loans but do not issue them. Only about a dozen banks on this street are slightly engaged in the business; most of the others are just passively handling transactions. Long-term loans are out of the question. Yesterday, the amount due was around one million, and although payments were being made, many defaulted. As a result, the amount collected was less than half, and the rest was rolled over. As far as new transactions are concerned, we only know of a few companies that made transactions of just over ten thousand. New transactions did not exceed twenty or thirty thousand.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Long-Term Settlement Exceeded 400,000; New Transactions Did Not Exceed 20,000 or 30,000</h3>
<p>Today's financial market is sluggish and generally quiet. It is particularly desolate on Sundays. Yesterday was a Sunday, and all banks were closed. Only a small portion of the money shops had a small number of transactions. However, due to the ongoing long-term settlements, the amount of long-term debt settled by the money shops yesterday exceeded 400,000, while the new amount made was only 20,000 or 30,000. Each transaction was at most 5,000, and the rest were only 1,000 or 2,000. In the market, foreign exchange was still quoted at nine fen, the same as the previous day. Interbank bill transactions totaled more than 3.2 million in the morning, with new transactions of more than 400,000. Afternoon transactions totaled more than 700,000, small denominations totaled more than 200,000, remittances to various places totaled more than 400,000, and foreign currency mortgages totaled more than 300,000. There was no news of new issues. Banks did not accept deposits, while money shops accepted more than 38 million in foreign public notes. The market price of subsidiary coins: Jiangnan small dollars remained the same, and there were no transactions. Guangdong small dollars rose slightly in the grey market by one li compared to the previous day, quoted at 1.101 yuan, but transactions were still few. Only 10,000 yuan were quoted in the morning, and the afternoon price was the same, with no transactions. Copper coins also remained unchanged, quoted at 3,003 yuan, with a transaction value of 2,200 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 6,600 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bullish Bond Traders Raise Prices to Cash Out</h3>
<p>Securities trading last week (March 30 to April 4) went from extreme consolidation to softening. Trading also went from extremely thin to slightly more active. The environment gradually unfolded from simmering dullness. The ceaseless "propaganda war" between Japan and Russia, the unresolved disputes between Germany and France, the Sino-Japanese issue, the smuggling issue, and the financial issue all caused unease. Because the bond market was in the midst of reform, most unified bonds had not yet been exchanged for physical assets. Therefore, the amount circulating in the market did not become crowded due to the increase in the number of bonds. The market was narrower than before. When there was demand, it was easy to raise prices. When there were sales, it was also easy to lower prices. However, these are not related to the overall quality of the bonds. It is expected that there will be drastic changes in the future. Last week, the overall trend was one of gradual decline. The trend was quite sluggish. Because the large bullish traders could not turn things around, in addition to finding ways to painfully roll over positions off-market each month, they could neither sell off nor roll over positions on the market. They had to raise prices again in order to cash out under the cover of high prices. This kind of phenomenon was quite apparent last week. On Monday, the Northern Bank sold off, and the Number 17 bond was also sold. The numbered bonds were still being bought. The market price was down by a few cents. On Tuesday, Numbers 10, 11, 20, and 47 were all sold off, in the same lineup as the previous sellers. The market price fell by another few cents. On Wednesday, the sellers were still the same as Tuesday. Selling sentiment was strong. Only Numbers 5 and 54 were buying slightly. The drop was a few cents to more than one yuan. Starting Thursday, Number 16 sold off various bonds quite a bit, and it uniquely bought Class A bonds. Number 4 also bought. Class A bonds surged by 7.5 cents, and the rest were up by a few cents. On Friday, Number 35 bought quite a bit. Numbers 4 and 35 also bought more than they sold. Number 16 maintained its fixed objective. Class A bonds rose again by 4.5 cents. Class E bonds fell slightly by one fen. The situation on Saturday was roughly the same as Friday. Class A bonds rose again by 3.5 cents, while the rest were mostly down by one to three cents. Within three days, Number 16 only bought Class A bonds, and sold most of the rest. There was demand every day and every round. Therefore, the market price for the week resulted in only Class A bonds rising by 1.5 and 2.5 cents, while the rest were down by a small number of cents. Class E bonds were down by 9.5 cents, and Class D bonds were down the most, by more than one yuan. The total transaction volume was 25.48 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai dispatch, the opening forecast for white cotton futures for the July-August period was 199 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Cotton Prices Are Mostly Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with prices down 1 to 4 points for each month. Transactions were few. Industry players are waiting for the detailed rules on cotton loans to be announced tomorrow and are unwilling to buy in advance. Besides some long positions being closed out for the May contract, there was also hedging selling of cotton in storage, but it was all absorbed by the industry. The closing price was stable, with spot prices down 2 points and futures down 1 to 4 points. English spot cotton fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 4 points. The Indian cotton market was dim, and transactions were few. Flat Gold and Oomra rose by one rupee. White Creek rose by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (4th dispatch).</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>Stomach Nourishment Method</h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>A strong and healthy person must have a strong appetite, and a strong appetite is due to a healthy stomach function. Therefore, those who eat and drink heartily are usually strong and robust. If the appetite is weak and digestion is poor, the person will inevitably be sallow, thin, weak, and prone to illness. Therefore, stomach function is a matter that cannot be ignored. Mr. Fan Chengyu is 30 years old. Due to catching a cold and losing his appetite, his stomach became weak. He had no desire to eat, often felt bloated, sometimes experienced sharp pain, sometimes felt nauseous, and sometimes vomited acid. Although medication relieved the symptoms, the illness returned when the medication was stopped, resulting in a weak and sickly body. He sought treatment from me. I instructed him to take German "Strong Stomach Essence," and he immediately felt a strong appetite, with a pleasant taste in his mouth. He continued to take it for about a month, and all his ailments disappeared. His complexion became rosy, and his body became healthy, very different from before. At a large gathering, his food consumption was extraordinary, astonishing everyone present! This medicine is powerful and pure, without any irritation. Because it contains spleen extract (an internal hormone), it is excellent for nourishing the blood and brain. It also contains vitamins B and D, which are effective in treating beriberi and strengthening the entire body.</p>
<h3>Radical Cure for Nocturnal Emission and Weakness</h3>
<p>— Contributed by Hu Dachun of this City</p>
<p>My close friend, Nie Renjie, was originally a bright and intelligent young man who could memorize anything at a glance. However, due to indulging in inappropriate novels, he developed the bad habit of self-gratification. This damaged his youth glands, stunted his development, and caused nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and a decline in the erectile strength of his penis. He also experienced head distension, mental weakness, a haggard appearance, complete memory loss, insomnia, and weakened vision. His illness was fully manifested, and he had entered a state of premature aging. He was forced to marry at home, which made Mr. Nie even more distressed. He came to me for advice, and I introduced him to purchase and take "Bodytone," invented by German Dr. Mellen. Fortunately, Mr. Nie reformed his past habit of masturbation. After taking four or five bottles of this medicine, he felt his vitality return, and symptoms such as spermatorrhea disappeared immediately. His muscles became stronger, and his appearance became plump and rosy. The love between the newly married couple was complete. Therefore, I deeply understand the greatness of "Bodytone's" effectiveness. I have continuously introduced it to several people, and the results have been outstanding and superior.</p>
<h3>Clinical Experiment Record of Dr. Deng Yuanhe on Lung Disease: Hemoptysis and Nocturnal Emission Cured; Health Restored</h3>
<p>Patient: Mr. Liu Ligong, 25 years old, student. Medical history: Early-age self-gratification, followed by indulgence in sexual activity, resulting in a depleted and exhausted body. Symptoms: Frequent hemoptysis, thick and choking cough, hidden chest pain, palpitations, night sweats, reduced appetite, insomnia, nocturnal emission, weak kidneys. Repeatedly took preparations, but they were always ineffective, and his body became increasingly thin. Introduced by his classmate, Mr. Li Jingguo, he sought treatment from me. Prescription: Auscultation revealed bubbling sounds; sputum examination revealed tuberculosis bacteria. The disease was progressing and could not be cured by ordinary preparations. He was instructed to rest quietly and take a large dose of German "Pulmotone" to coagulate blood, remove phlegm, kill tuberculosis bacteria, and stop coughing. At the same time, he was instructed to take German "Bodytone" to treat insomnia and kidney disease. Within three weeks, his ailments disappeared, and his chronic illness was completely cured. His appetite greatly increased, and his spirit was radiant! He continued to take the previous medication for several bottles in order to seek a radical cure. Yesterday, I received a thank-you letter from him, saying that he no longer felt tired even after great exertion, and his love with his wife was more enduring than ever.</p>
<h3>Hemoptysis and Choking Cough Cured Radically</h3>
<p>Patient: Ms. Guan Sujuan, 24 years old, writer. Ailment: Overuse of the brain, exhaustion from overwork. Symptoms: Choking cough and shortness of breath, blood in sputum. Weak stomach and limbs, dizziness and palpitations. Late menstruation, many dreams and little sleep. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and she was extremely weak. Last spring, she sought treatment from me. Prescription: Examination revealed that her lung disease had reached the third stage. I prescribed medication according to her symptoms, mainly using "Pulmotone" to cure her hemoptysis and choking cough, and at the same time, I prescribed "Beauty Plus" to regulate menstruation, nourish the brain, and treat her weakness. Within a month, she was completely cured. She slept soundly at night, and her weight increased sharply. After suffering from tuberculosis for many years, she was radically cured! Fearing a recurrence, she continued to take the previous medication for more than ten days. The other day, she came to the clinic on business. I saw that her complexion was rosy, her muscles were full, and she had regained her health and beauty. She said that whenever she held a pen, her writing flowed like a tide, and her spirit was even better.</p>
<h3>German Special Medicine for Gonorrhea: Clinical Experiment Photos of "Cleronin"</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>(1) Urgent Urination</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Fan Zhouyun, 26 years old, resident of Bubbling Well Road, contracted gonorrhea after getting drunk in 1932. He sought medical treatment with injections and medication, but it was not cured. He always felt frequent urination, but urination was not smooth and was mixed with blood spots. His lower abdomen was full and felt like it was not completely emptied. His testicles were slightly painful and swollen. This was urethral stricture and epididymitis. He was instructed to take "Cleronin" to radically cure his old gonorrhea. Within three weeks, his urination was smooth, his urine was clear, his lower abdomen was relaxed, and his testicle swelling subsided. He continued to take it for another week and was completely cured. However, his wife had vaginal erosion and a lot of leucorrhea. This was undoubtedly transmitted by Mr. Fan. She took "Cleronin" internally and used "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" externally. In less than four weeks, she was completely cured. She has been repeatedly stimulated and has never relapsed.</p>
<p>(2) Purulent Bloody Discharge from the Urethra</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Zhu Shaoyao, 19 years old, was induced by a prostitute and contracted gonorrhea. Initially, his urethra was itchy and painful, and then he felt uncomfortable urinating. Soon after, purulent bloody discharge flowed from his urethra. His glans was swollen, and his foreskin was inflamed and swollen, causing him great pain. He came to my clinic for treatment. After cleaning his external urethra, I gave him "Cleronin." In less than three weeks, the pain stopped, the swelling subsided, and his urine was clear. Afterwards, I performed more than ten blood serum tests, and there was never a positive reaction. There is no doubt that he was radically cured. "Cleronin" has been popular in Europe and America for a long time, and all famous doctors are vying to use it. Therefore, since the invention of this medicine, the number of people suffering from this disease has decreased by 70% to 80%. It is conceivable how great the effectiveness of "Cleronin" is.</p>
<h3>Senility of Male and Female Nerves</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Human aging is due to the decrease or lack of male and female hormones. Therefore, to prevent premature aging or to prolong youth, it is necessary to supplement hormones to maintain the body's vitality. This organ therapy is truly the greatest happiness of mankind. However, in the era of youth development, both men and women lack sexual knowledge and are often confused by bad friends and abuse masturbation, or due to early marriage and indulgence in excess, which are the main causes of aging of the sexual nerves.</p>
<p>In the process of premature aging in both sexes, men experience nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and weak penile erection, while women experience menstrual disorders and leucorrhea. The symptoms include prolonged infertility, insomnia, mental depression, bad mood, dizziness, poor memory, muscle wasting, wrinkles on the forehead, yellow hair, and no interest in life. Therefore, they easily fall into pessimism and a world-weary path. German Dr. Mellen deeply lamented the suffering of young men and women and invented the use of the testicles of male animals and the ovaries of female animals to extract fresh hormones using scientific new methods, making "Bodytone" (for men) and "Beauty Plus" (for women) to supplement the lack of hormones in both sexes, so that the tissues of the reproductive system can be thoroughly transformed. Therefore, those who are prematurely aged can restore their original health and beauty, and all sexual neurasthenia, prolonged infertility, menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, etc., will be cured at this time. Therefore, "Bodytone" and "Beauty Plus" are welcomed by both men and women around the world, because they have the effect of eliminating disease and maintaining youth.</p>
<h3>The Most Ideal Preparation for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Since the daily progress of science in the twentieth century, medical treatment for various diseases has made considerable achievements; however, the virulent flames of gonorrhea are still rampant. Why? It is certainly not due to a lack of medicine for gonorrhea; on the contrary, there are plenty of them! The way to eradicate gonorrhea should not be too violent. If it is too violent, it will kill the innocent as well as the guilty. Before you benefit from it, you will suffer from its harm. Nor should it be too slow, because slowness will not help in an emergency and will not be able to stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, although there are many medicines for gonorrhea, it is rare to find one that is effective and has no drawbacks. This has allowed gonococci to become rampant! Governments of various countries have set up special research institutions to conduct extensive experiments. Finally, the German gonorrhea wonder drug "Cleronin" was invented, and famous hospitals throughout Europe have rushed to use it, with remarkable results. This medicine is effective, pure in quality, slow but not dull, and has no drawbacks such as being too violent or insufficient, making it the most suitable preparation that combines suppression and pacification. After taking it, it can be completely cured; whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea and its complications, it can eliminate toxins and sweep away everything! According to statistics from major hospitals in various countries, the rate of rapid cure for men who take this medicine is over 97%. Women, because they are determined to take the medicine and because they have "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" for external treatment, have been tested hundreds of times with unfailing accuracy. Therefore, in recent times, all doctors and patients in Europe are using this medicine! (Abridged translation of a report from the German Medical Journal in December of last year.)</p>
<h3>Years of Gonorrhea Cured Suddenly</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhu</p>
<p>I suffered from gonorrhea and was misguided in my treatment, which resulted in a stubborn illness. When I exerted myself during bowel movements, turbid flocculent matter would flow out. It was distressing and troublesome! Last autumn, my testicles became swollen and hard again, and the pain was deep. The doctor said that both were swollen, and there was no hope of having children. My wife and I were filled with sorrow. And my illness became more and more severe! My body was thin. Fortunately, I sought treatment from Dr. Yao Juyan. After he used shortwave electrotherapy for the first week, the pain was reduced; after two weeks of X-ray treatment, the swelling softened, and urination was smooth. In the third week, he mainly used the latest German invention, "Anti-Gonorrhea Serum," for treatment, and the swelling and pain were completely eliminated, and my urine was clear. He also performed surgical massage on me, and I was told that my spirit was invigorated and my health was increasing day by day. It has been half a year now, and it has not recurred. My kidneys are strong, and my vitality has been restored. This is all thanks to Dr. Yao! I specially record my gratitude to serve as a precious raft for those suffering from the same illness!</p>
<h3>Women's Unmentionable Illnesses</h3>
<p>— Jin Yueren</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Nine out of ten men have hemorrhoids, and nine out of ten women have leucorrhea," which shows the prevalence of leucorrhea among women. The cause of this disease is due to shyness, delayed treatment, and allowing it to spread, which damages their health. Those who suffer discharge purulent secretions from the vagina, sometimes with itching, sometimes with burning, and sometimes affecting urination. The external genitals are also eroded and painful. The foul odor makes people want to vomit. Patients therefore become more depressed. Whenever I encounter this symptom, I instruct them to purchase German "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" and treat themselves at home, which often has miraculous effects. Moreover, it is extremely pleasant to use locally and has no greasy disadvantages. If leucorrhea is caused by gonorrhea, it is more effective to take it at the same time as "Cleronin." One kills bacteria and eliminates inflammation, while the other kills bacteria and converges. Therefore, the efficacy is also outstanding and unique.</p>
<h3>The Harm of Excessive Phlegm</h3>
<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>People with excessive phlegm usually suffer from chronic bronchitis catarrh. If the inflammation worsens, it often leads to pneumonia. The elderly and children often experience difficulty breathing, and there is often danger! Therefore, patients should not delay treatment. In my clinical experience, I most appreciate the use of the German medicine "Pulmotone" for this disease. Only four or five bottles can clear the phlegm. Its treatment is truly miraculous. Therefore, it is good for treating colds and whooping cough in children. Because it also contains hormones from turtle, flounder, and bear and deer liver, lungs, and spleen, it nourishes the essence and strengthens the foundation, and it is good for treating all stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. It is also rich in egg yolk lecithin, which is good for treating mental fatigue, smoker's cough, and quitting addiction. If you continue to take it for a month, you will definitely see an increase in appetite and health, and you will be immune to all diseases.</p>

<p>Imbalance After Illness</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Chunhua asks: After a serious illness, my body has gradually become weak, I have nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, my appetite has decreased sharply, and my body is weak. What medicine can cure this?</p>
<p>Answer: This is neurasthenia. You can take "Bodytone" and "Strong Stomach Essence" to cure yourself.</p>
<p>The Illness of the Couple</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Chongfeng asks: I have contracted gonorrhea, and my urethra is now painful and my urination is uncomfortable. Recently, I have infected my wife, resulting in constant leucorrhea, and her body is very weak, so she is often confined to bed. Please show me the treatment so that my wife and I can be cured.</p>
<p>Answer: You can ask Dr. Yao Juyan to treat you, but before treatment, you can take "Cleronin." Your wife can take "Cleronin" and "Beauty Plus" internally, and use "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" externally. Pay attention to hygiene, and you can cure yourself.</p>
<p>Fever and Cough</p>
<p>My nephew, Yongtang, is 18 years old and suffers from severe lung disease. He is as thin as a stick, has no appetite, coughs frequently, and has rosy cheeks. What can be done to cure him?</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Pulmotone" for lung disease, and use "Strong Essence" to promote his appetite and make his nutrition strong, so it is easy to cure.</p>
<h3>Clinical Report on Gonorrhea by Dr. Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Long-Term Gonorrhea Causes Nerve Damage</p>
<p>The genital area is the most sensitive part of the body, as it is rich in nerves. If gonococci invade this area, the initial local area often loses its senses due to pain, and some may even lose their reproductive power forever. If you delay and allow the gonococci to penetrate deeper, the injury to the sexual nerves is even worse. Therefore, we often see that the erection of the penis is weak, or there is a painful erection with nocturnal emission. If you take the semen and examine it under an 800x microscope, you can see countless sperm fighting with gonococci, and many pus blood cells are mixed in between, the danger of the shape is frightening. If the gonococci are not completely eliminated, the sperm will be killed by the gonococci, which will inevitably lead to infertility.</p>
<p>Since this disease is caused by gonococci and leads to sexual neurasthenia, both must be treated at the same time. I treated Mr. Ren Yongnian, who was plagued by gonorrhea and subsequently developed nocturnal emission. His penis erected sensitively, and he had painful ejaculation during sexual intercourse. The couple had been infertile for many years. I immediately used anti-gonorrhea serum and electrotherapy, and internally, I used "Cleronin" and "Bodytone" together, because "Cleronin" can eliminate gonorrhea, promote urination, and relieve pain. "Bodytone" can turn weakness into strength and transform the tissues of the reproductive system. After taking the medicine for more than a month, the disease was suddenly cured. Also, because his wife had a lot of gonorrhea leucorrhea, I still instructed her to purchase German "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" and take "Cleronin" internally. She was also cured in four weeks. Three years have passed, and she has one son and one daughter.</p>

<h3>Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>The brain is the main part of the human body. The expression of will and the gallop of thoughts all come from the mission of the central part, which is very important. If the brain is not healthy, everything cannot be fully developed. Modern young people feel that their brain power is not strong, so they lose their happiness. Some even commit suicide excessively, which is an incurable disease. The reason for this is that the recorded nervous system is weak. The beginning of this disease may be due to congenital deficiency and acquired imbalance. However, the sky is due to the destruction of bad habits or excessive sexual activity. In addition, diligence in study, hypersensitivity, and long-term mental work can all cause neurasthenia. The perfect medicine for this disease is none other than "Anershen" Arolsen, because it is rich in organic phosphorus and endocrine and other kidney-strengthening drugs. Therefore, all nervous systems can play its nourishing effect. For example, symptoms of sexual dysfunction such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation can also be treated effectively with this medicine.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Hinders Fertility</h3>
<p>— Pingfan</p>
<p>Female gonorrhea is divided into urethral gonorrhea and uterine gonorrhea. Urethral gonorrhea is also caused by unclean sexual intercourse, but it is lighter and easier to cure than male gonorrhea. Because the female urethra is wide and short, it can be cured without treatment by frequent flushing of urine. It is not as difficult to treat as the male urethra, which is long, narrow, and curved. Uterine gonorrhea is mostly caused by the direct injection of gonococci into the uterus during sexual intercourse and ejaculation when the male has acute gonorrhea. The symptoms are chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, lower abdominal pain, being bedridden, and mental anxiety. The vulva also becomes inflamed due to the stimulation of secretions. After rest, the symptoms are reduced, but sticky yellow secretions are discharged. This turns into a chronic disease. If the pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis does not go away, it will cause inflammation of the fallopian tubes and ovaries, or uterine peritonitis, which will definitely hinder menstruation and damage ovulation. It cannot combine with male sperm, inducing secondary peritonitis, and there is a change in life and death. Even if one is fortunate enough to escape the disaster, the uterus will be oppressed by the inflammation, making it impossible to conceive. Therefore, women with gonorrhea should be treated far away to protect their bodies and future generations. As for the treatment methods: (1) External medicine, such as "Gono-Serol", can be used for both the vagina and urethra. (2) Internal medicine, such as "Mesalin", is effective for both new and old gonorrhea. (3) Injections, such as pigment preparations, vaccines, or antitoxins, are all effective. (4) Electrotherapy, such as shortwave diathermy machines and the latest turbidity treatment machines, can all assist in the treatment of this disease. However, home treatment for this type of disease is always inadequate. It is best to seek diagnosis and treatment from a specialist. Dr. Hayes, a German medical doctor on the second floor of the Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, is good at treating miscellaneous gynecological diseases and is a famous contemporary gynecologist.</p>
<h3>On Treating Ringworm</h3>
<p>— Huang Mingjing</p>
<p>Ringworm is a type of skin disease that is extremely contagious, appearing and disappearing intermittently. If not treated with dedicated care, it is very difficult to eradicate completely. The source of ringworm is through contagion, and it is more easily contracted by those with weak skin resistance. Usually, both doctors and patients consider this disease as insignificant and rarely pay attention to diagnosis and treatment. Little do they know that thorough eradication is not an easy task, like ichthyosis. Upon investigation, for treatment of this condition, the best approach using electrical devices is to use artificial sun lamps or Kromayer lamps for irradiation. As for medication, there is now a specialized preparation called "Misulzine," which has the ability to penetrate deeply into the skin layers, thereby destroying the underlying ringworm fungi completely. It is called a holy medicine for skin diseases, and this is no exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Gonorrheal Orchitis</h3>
<p>— Cheng Liang</p>
<p>In the initial infection of gonorrhea, the symptoms are still mild. The pathogen of gonorrhea is the gonococcus. This bacterium enters the urethra from the urethral opening, so the initial symptom is always acute anterior urethritis. At this time, one should immediately take "Mesalin" and use "Gono-Serol" externally at the same time. In this way, the gonococcus can be eliminated, and gonorrhea can be cured. If treatment is delayed or not administered properly, and the gonococcus is not completely killed, then the gonococcus will gradually invade the posterior urethra, and acute gonorrhea will turn into subacute gonorrhea, and then into chronic gonorrhea. From here, it can invade the bladder, causing cystitis, invade the prostate, causing prostatitis, and once it invades the testicles, it causes orchitis.</p>
<p>When gonorrheal orchitis occurs, due to the swelling of the testicles, people often mistake it for a hernia? They do not know that the so-called hernia is caused by the small intestine descending from the abdominal cavity and falling into the scrotum. In medicine, this is called a hernia, which is very different from gonorrheal orchitis. Gonorrheal orchitis is entirely caused by the gonococcus invading the testicles and causing inflammation, and it is a complication of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>At the onset of this condition, in addition to redness, swelling, and pain in one testicle in the scrotum, there is also a severe aching pain in the lower back, making it difficult to stand up and walk. This condition should be treated quickly; otherwise, it may leave behind hardened nodules that are difficult to completely dissipate. When treating this condition, in addition to treating the underlying cause according to gonorrhea treatment principles, local anti-inflammatory measures should not be delayed. Electrical devices such as Sollux lamps and medications such as calcium agents and lead acetate can be used.</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatments for Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Renjie</p>
<p>Stomach pain is a symptom, not the name of a disease. There are many diseases that can cause stomach pain. Apart from severe conditions that can rapidly lead to death, such as gastric ulcers and stomach cancer, acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, hyperacidity, and gastric fluid leakage can also cause stomach pain. For treatment of these conditions, medications such as alkali agents are required. Among these specialized preparations, "Wei Bao" is the most superior. Using "Wei Bao" is not only effective for treating stomach pain, but it also has special effects for acute and chronic catarrh, hyperacidity, and gastric fluid leakage, resulting in a happy return to health. It can also be taken for indigestion and other conditions. Furthermore, during the treatment period for stomach pain, attention should be paid to diet. Easily digestible foods should be selected, with liquid foods being the most suitable. Hard, indigestible solid foods and spicy, sour, or otherwise irritating foods, as well as spoiled foods, should be avoided.</p>
<h3>A Word for Those Suffering from Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Ling De</p>
<p>Everyone knows that gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat. This is because once the gonococcus invades the human body, it deeply hides within the epithelial cell gaps of the infected person's urethra. Furthermore, the structure of the gonococcus is diplococcal, so even if the medicinal power tries to penetrate deeply and kill it, it is more difficult. There are many methods for treating syphilis: local injection of drug solutions, injection of mixed gonorrhea vaccines and pigments, and internal administration of diuretic bactericides can be said to be exhaustive treatments. However, the gonococcus often still exists. At this time, it is essential to conduct detailed examinations; otherwise, even if it is temporarily in a static state, it will reappear its inflammatory effects when there is a suitable opportunity. Over months and years, it appears and disappears intermittently, leaving patients feeling disappointed. However, unbeknownst to them, with the flourishing of science today, there are new inventions in treatment methods, such as short-wave diathermy and the latest gonorrhea treatment machines. Even in terms of oral medications, the recently developed holy medicine for treating gonorrhea, "Mesalin," can truly be called the gonococcus's greatest enemy. This medicine not only has a strong bactericidal effect but also has the functions of reducing inflammation, relieving pain, preventing decay, and promoting urination. I have used it many times and have always achieved complete cures. At the same time, combining it with electrotherapy and injections yields even better results. Because "Mesalin" is rich in membrane-penetrating bactericidal action, regardless of whether the bacteria are encapsulated or deeply hidden in the mucous membranes, its medicinal power can deeply penetrate the membrane layers and directly act on the bacteria, which is something that general gonorrhea treatments cannot achieve. Gonorrhea is an extremely prevalent disease, so I have written this article to explain the functions and effects of this famous medicine.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A about Diseases</h3>
<p>Readers who have questions about diseases can send letters to inquire. The letters must be written clearly. If there are many questions, they can be listed as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. The condition and course of the disease must be explained in detail and concisely. For those who require a written response, please attach two cents of postage for local addresses and five cents of postage for out-of-town addresses. Send to Shanghai Post Office Box 1668, and a special letter will be sent in response.</p>
<p>Once a Prostitute is Visited</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Liu Hanqiu) A few days ago, due to a moment of confusion, I visited a prostitute once. Yesterday, I discovered two small pimples in the coronal sulcus of my glans. I can see the pus inside with my naked eye. I have chills and fever, and the pain is extreme. Please tell me (1) what is this disease? (2) How should it be treated? (3) Which doctor specializes in this type of disease? (4) What are the consequences of not seeking treatment?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) This is chancroid, or a combined soft and hard chancre. (2) If it is indeed a combined soft and hard chancre, then in addition to syphilis treatment (such as 606 injections), it is necessary to administer soft chancre vaccine dermoscose injections and local antiseptic disinfection. (3) Chuncai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city, completely cures venereal diseases and has various electrical devices available for treatment. (4) Untreated primary syphilis can progress to secondary syphilis. Untreated soft chancre can gradually expand.</p>
<p>Tossing and Turning in Bed</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Li Shijie) A relative of mine has been suffering from stomach pain that comes and goes. Recently, it has become more severe, causing him to toss and turn in bed. All medicines are ineffective, and only opium can temporarily relieve the pain. Please tell me (1) what effective medicine can cure this disease? (2) Where can it be purchased, and what is the price?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) "Wei Bao" is a good medicine for stomach diseases and is especially effective for stomach pain. You can try taking it. (2) This medicine is sold by Renshou Pharmacy at No. 1 Laodexing Lane, Mintini Road, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession, this city. Major pharmacies and major companies such as Sincere, Wing On, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Sino-Western, and Sino-French all sell it.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Xu Caibin) I am thirty-four years old. My physical strength has never been as good as others. I have not had any children after marriage. In recent years, I have become quite tired of my career. My memory is poor, and I have heaviness and dizziness in my head. I previously consulted at Chuncai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city. According to the doctor, it is neurasthenia. Later, I left Shanghai for elsewhere and was unable to continue treatment. Please tell me (1) what self-treatment oral medications are available for this condition? (2) How should I take care of myself? I would be very grateful if you could publish this in your esteemed publication.</p>
<p>Answer: (1) You can take "Arolen." This medicine is sold in major pharmacies and major companies in this city. (2) You must avoid mental work and all irregular lifestyles.</p>
<p>Shortwave Diathermy</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Lu Xianghe) Ten years ago, I occasionally contracted gonorrhea and was cured after treatment, but it recurs from time to time. According to the doctor, shortwave diathermy is needed to be effective. Please tell me (1) what effect does shortwave diathermy have on gonorrhea? (2) Which hospital in Shanghai has the equipment for this?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Shortwave diathermy uses electrical heat to kill latent gonococci. (2) Chuncai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city has the equipment for this. The hospital's treatment of gonorrhea is very comprehensive.</p>
<p>Fine Skin Granules</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Qian Yawen) Fine granules suddenly appeared on the skin of my limbs, scattered in red and black. They are slightly raised and break when scratched, becoming slightly moist. Because applying medicine is ineffective, I am sending this letter to your publication to ask you to recommend an effective medicine.</p>
<p>Answer: Try applying "Misulzine."</p>
<p>Self-Treatment Medication</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Xu Liyuan) A friend of mine, due to carelessness in making friends, stepped into the world of prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea. Currently, there is a lot of white mucus being discharged from the urethra from time to time, and urination is extremely painful. Because he lives far away in the countryside, I ask your publication to recommend a self-treatment method so that he can be cured of this terrible disease.</p>
<p>Answer: This is acute gonorrhea. In addition to taking care of himself, avoiding labor, and avoiding irritating foods, for self-treatment, he can take "Mesalin" orally and use "Gono-Serol" externally.</p>
<p>Redness, Swelling, and Pain</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Xu Xiangkui) I mistakenly visited a prostitute once ten days ago. At first, there were no abnormalities, and I was secretly relieved. However, three days ago, a lump the size of a chicken egg suddenly appeared in the groin of my thigh, making it difficult to walk. Recently, it has become more red, swollen, and painful, and I also have chills and fever. I don't know what this disease is and how it should be treated. Which hospital in Shanghai has the most complete and appropriate treatment for venereal diseases? Are there electrotherapy methods available, without the need for surgery?</p>
<p>Answer: This is bubo. Bubo can be caused by syphilis, gonorrhea, or soft chancre. It is necessary to find the cause and treat it accordingly. Chuncai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city, is good at treating venereal diseases. For this condition, Sollux lamp irradiation can be used for electrotherapy. Whether surgery can be avoided depends on a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>Wanting to Circumcise</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Lin Yixiang) I feel uncomfortable with my penile foreskin and know that it is unhygienic. I urgently want to remove it. I don't know which hospital in Shanghai is skilled in this surgery. Please recommend one with reasonable fees and experienced surgeons.</p>
<p>Answer: Chuncai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, this city, is skilled in this surgery. It is said that the hospital only charges ten yuan for the circumcision fee.</p>
<p>Suffering from Scabies</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Luo Shizong) I accidentally contracted scabies and also have pus, similar to weeping scabies. I am seeking a treatment method.</p>
<p>Answer: In addition to cleaning the affected areas of the body and applying "Misulzine," the underwear and bedding must be washed with "Lysol" solution mixed with a small amount, and they should be changed daily.</p>
<p>Treatment for Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>(Asked by Mr. Li Yuanying) I am currently nineteen years old and studying. Unfortunately, I have a hidden disease of nocturnal emission, sometimes even twice a night. I have taken many tonifying medicines on the market, but they have had little effect. I am consulting your publication, hoping for detailed instructions.</p>
<p>Answer: In addition to medication, you must strictly take care of yourself. For example, you must urinate before going to bed and wash your feet with cold or warm water. Sleep on your side, or use a belt to prevent your legs from straightening. You must also avoid excessive labor and long-distance walking. As for medication, you can take "Arolsen."</p>
<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Zhang Tianshi Seeks an Official Title</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>We won't forget, will we? When the Northern Expeditionary Army established Jiangnan, the head of Taoism, Zhang Tianshi from Mount Longhu, could no longer live peacefully, was driven down the mountain, and has been residing in Shanghai, living the secluded life of a fallen man. However, after a long period of seclusion, he desired to move, and his final fate gradually appeared bleak. Of course, his productivity was gone, and his assets were decreasing day by day, with the general sense of the sun setting in the west, on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Recently, our Master of Mount Longhu has become active again. Perhaps he felt an interest in officialdom, so he requested the National Government to grant him an official title and seal, wanting to be glorious. As a result, he was rejected internally and hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>We know that the Tianshi is in charge of talismans, which have been passed down through generations and have been highly respected by emperors of all dynasties. This time, he condescended to seek a small official title, but he was rejected internally, which inevitably caused him to lose face. Therefore, he was certainly resentful and cursed, "People's hearts are not as good as they used to be!"</p>
<p>However, we know that China has reached a time of peril. Human life is painful, and it is no longer possible to survive by hiding in the mountains and dreaming. If Zhang Tianshi wants to maintain his millennia-old authority, he had better take out the legendary magic weapons, summon wind and rain, to make sure there are no floods or droughts in the world, or go to the Yongding River to suppress the floods, or go to Shaanxi and Gansu to relieve the drought, or, at the very least, scatter beans to turn them into soldiers and go to the Northeast to command the unfortunate slaves who believe in spirits to recover lost territory and win back freedom and property... Because we know that, no matter what, we must have matter as our foundation. It is impossible to survive. Does Zhang Tianshi think that getting an official title from the National Government will greatly enhance his divine power? Can it relieve the many people who are in dire straits? Similarly, can getting an official title reorganize Mount Longhu?</p>
<p>However, we know that Zhang Tianshi cannot survive or preserve his divine authority if he does not walk the same path as the masses. We hope that the masses will not dream of impossible paths!</p>
<h3>Anticipation</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Er</p>
<p>The old shoemaker Lu Sheng almost always went to the small train station outside the town every evening to meet and send off each train. He was so nervous that he never let up, using his dim old eyes to search every passenger, trying to match the memories he had of those he thought of day and night, as he intently searched each passenger, sometimes holding his breath, afraid that he would miss them in a moment of inattention.</p>
<p>It had been six or seven days already. He watched the train slowly crawl into the station, and after the sharp whistle, it slowly crawled out again, until it disappeared into the darkness; but all he got was a heavy disappointment. All those going back and forth were irrelevant people. Others laughed and greeted each other with words of reunion, shaking hands so warmly and cordially. Children sang and danced... as if they didn't know there was a lonely old shoemaker! How anxious he was! He rushed around in the crowd, his dim eyes wearily following every strange face, his heart pounding, he shouted loudly! "Lu Dahai!" His hoarse throat cracked as he shouted wildly, he was going crazy!</p>
<p>No one would pay attention to this old man. Everyone was busy doing what they had to do.</p>
<p>After a few trains had passed, the clock on the platform pointed grandly at the number twelve. He felt that today was hopeless again. He muttered to himself: "He should have come earlier, the nine o'clock train! Nine o'clock..."</p>
<p>The station gradually became calm. He pondered the reason why Lu Dahai hadn't come: "Is he sick?" "Doesn't he have travel expenses?" "Doesn't his workplace let him go?" "...Later, he comforted himself in the same way as he had always done: "! He will definitely come, tomorrow definitely, just tomorrow..."</p>
<p>Fatigue whipped him as he walked back the way he came, a young man's shadow still spinning in his mind. He silently recited some unknowable words, staggering along the dark country road, lifting his feet with difficulty.</p>
<p>Another foolish hope shone before him: "Maybe he let him go unnoticed, maybe he's already home now!" So, like a shot of adrenaline, he mustered his courage, forgot everything, and quickly walked to chase after the "hope" that was running ahead!</p>
<p>He reached the door of his house. He gently pushed it open, as if he were startling his son. He groped his way to the table. He skillfully grabbed the match. In the instant that it was lit, he thought his son might appear, so he lit the kerosene lamp...</p>
<p>His hope was shattered. Before his eyes was still an empty, dark house. His son had not returned!</p>
<p>He was heartbroken. Tears fell from his dim, dazed eyes. He collapsed onto the bed like a piece of wood, buried his face in his hands, and sobbed...</p>
<h3>Uncle Zhisheng</h3>
<p>— Chenji</p>
<p>Humanity is destroying itself!</p>
<p>It's been half a year since I last saw Uncle Zhisheng. We often bring him up.</p>
<p>"Really, where has this happy person gone?" Mother said, turning her head to us while washing vegetables.</p>
<p>"Poor vagrant, a bachelor, he has no fixed abode. Maybe he has gone wandering again." Father spat out a cloud of strong tobacco smoke, and I could only vaguely see his worried face as he felt sympathy for Uncle Zhisheng.</p>
<p>We all fell silent. In this silence, I remembered Uncle Zhisheng's cheerful manner.</p>
<p>I remember it was on a day, one of the days when we were celebrating a festival, that he suddenly arrived at our house very early. Our whole family welcomed him, especially my mother. "Ah! What wind blew you here?" He laughed loudly, his laughter almost slightly shaking the window panes in the house. His voice was always so loud, he said: "What wind? Sister-in-law! I came to drink old wine!" He laughed like a madman again, and from this wild laughter, we could hear his intermittent voice: "You... wouldn't... refuse... me... would you?..."</p>
<p>So he sat next to me, hugged my shoulders, and said to me: "My good young master! Don't read books so hard. I'm telling you, I don't know a single word, but five years ago, I was a cattle dealer, and I had ten thousand yuan in my hands. My rough arms can embrace ten prostitutes. Don't look at my face so terribly black, but my money is bright and white, people all give me smiling faces, I give them meat to eat, I give them wine to drink... But, my good young master! I don't know a single word!..." He patted my shoulders again.</p>
<p>Then he said to my father: "A hundred people eat under my hands..." We had heard this a thousand times. My mother was killing a chicken, and the big rooster was struggling desperately. His topic changed immediately. He went up to help my mother, saying, "I used to kill three thousand pairs of chickens at once." We all laughed. He did not get angry at our laughter, which mocked him for exaggerating, but only emphasized his tone and said, "Really, I'm not bragging!"</p>
<p>That day, he drank five catties of wine and was only a little tipsy.</p>
<p>I yawned, stretched, and said weakly: "Perhaps this kind of person is the happiest in the world?" Suddenly, my mother shouted, "Speak of Cao Cao and Cao Cao arrives! Zhisheng! We were just talking about you again."</p>
<p>I raised my head and saw Uncle Zhisheng dragging in a black and gray head, entering the guest room, only deeply sighed, and sat down heavily on a pair of benches. He supported his head with both hands, staring straight at something on the floor, and did not say a word. We were all shocked by him!</p>
<p>"Zhisheng! What's making you so unhappy?" Mother's voice was clearly a little trembling. Our eyes were all focused on his body. We were so eagerly waiting for his answer!</p>
<p>He sighed again, raised his head, and, as if with great effort, he licked his dry lips, listlessly saying: "I ate three months of lawsuit!"</p>
<p>"What? A lawsuit? What for?" Mother asked with such astonishment for us. So he told us that it was because he was too kind, putting a friend's suitcase in his room, but he did not expect that the suitcase was stolen by that friend. His friend was arrested, and he was arrested because stolen goods were found. "Yes! Would I be a thief?" But he had eaten three months of lawsuit after all!</p>
<p>He sighed again, and he was silent again! He seemed like a shadow sitting opposite me.</p>
<p>Looking at this sad shadow, my heart trembled! My tears flowed down.</p>
<p>Humanity is destroying itself!</p>
<h3>Summoning the Soul</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>"Little Huzi, come home, Little Huzi, find your mother..."</p>
<p>A desolate middle-aged woman called out continuously in the deep night, the end of her words drifting eerily into the night wind, carrying a shrill cry. The night was already very late, but she was still calling out along the street, the whole village was submerged in silent darkness, and every fence gate was closed. The night was as still as stagnant water, the sky pressed down low, with no moonlight or twinkling stars. In the air, only the desolate barking of dogs and the sound of tree branches swayed by the wind echoed occasionally.</p>
<p>This middle-aged woman dragged a long broom in her hand, moving step by step, one deep, one shallow, in the darkness. After taking a few steps, she sobbed out two calls, waited a moment, and then looked back at the broom. On that clump of dried broom sorghum, draped a red child's shirt. She gasped wearily, and when she crossed a street, she stopped, exhausted. She looked up at the deep black sky, and the houses on both sides of the street, crouching in the shadows, all slept peacefully. She exhaled a breath of resentment, raised her left arm, wiped away sweat with her sleeve, and then roused herself to shout again:</p>
<p>"Little Huzi, come home, Little Huzi, find your mother..."</p>
<p>She stared straight ahead, as if something in the night air were enticing her. She took difficult steps again, and when she turned into another street, she pushed open her own tightly closed little fence gate, dragged the broom (a cloud of yellow dust scattered into the night air with the broom), and hurriedly wiped the ground as she pulled it into the house.</p>
<p>Inside the house, a small bean oil lamp burned. In the incense burner on the Zaojun table, rings of smoke curled upward. On the earthen kang on the left, a child of about ten years old lay, so silent that there was not a sound. The choking smoke filled the small room. She dragged the broom to the front of the offering table, then stood with her knees together, bent over, and knelt down, prostrating herself, her forehead touching the mud floor. She raised her head and kowtowed again, her upper body rising and falling continuously, and she whispered a supplication:</p>
<p>"Zao Wangye (Kitchen God) protect our Huzi and bring him back, I will eat vegetarian food for a long time, burn incense continuously, Zao Wang Laoye have mercy..."</p>
<p>After she finished supplicating, she stood up, gently picked up the clothes from the broom, and moved her body step by step toward the edge of the kang, murmuring:</p>
<p>"Here's Mom, here's Mom, don't be afraid, Zao Wang is protecting you, ha..."</p>
<p>She walked to the edge of the kang, put the red shirt on the child, and touched his slightly breathing small lips. A hint of a smile appeared on the mother's worried face, as if she had been truly saved. She relaxed her heart and climbed down from the kang again, went to the yard, closed the fence gate, turned back into the house, and lit three new incense sticks, turning up the wick of the lamp a little more, illuminating the child who was not moving at all, his yellow and thin face and sunken eye sockets. She thought: tomorrow he will be able to call "Mom," and after carefully taking care of him for a few days, he will naturally become strong again. She pushed the lamp stand further away, and as she lay down, she stroked the soft, fluffy hair with one hand, before closing the eyes that had shed so many tears in the night wind, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The night passed leisurely. The gray dawn fell on the window lattice, the lamp wick chirped, and the rooster crowed clearly in the morning breeze. The poor mother also woke up from a nightmare. When she reached out to touch her son's forehead, the water-like coldness made her hand tremble. Frightened, she knelt down again to test the thin nose and the slightly upturned small mouth, but there was no breath at all. She shed tears silently, and fell on the small, stiff corpse, wailing heartbrokenly.</p>
<p>She went mad, wildly reaching out her arms to hold up the cold head, staring blankly. After a while, she cried miserably:</p>
<p>"I kept widowhood for eleven years, raised you, and you also left me like your father, I will also go..."</p>
<p>She hugged the child's corpse, and as the oil lamp suddenly went out, she also fainted.</p>
<h3>Nora (19)</h3>
<p>— Wan Chao Chen drawing, Qi Xin explanation</p>
<p>Nora saw Helmer return to the room, and quickly asked in a low voice: How did it go?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: (Answering in a low voice) I've told him.</p>
<p>Nora: Is he——</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: Nora, you should tell your husband everything from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Nora: (Deliberately or unintentionally) I know.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: You don't have to be afraid of Krogstad. But you must tell your husband the truth.</p>
<p>Nora: What if I don't tell him?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linde: Then, that letter will tell him.</p>
<p>Nora: Kristine, thank you, now I have a way, don't make a sound!</p>

<p>Opening "Zhang Huanhou"</p>
<p>His temper was like fierce fire, the brave Huanhou. He pledged brotherhood in the peach garden, their spirits aligned. He raised the flag to suppress the Yellow Turban Party. He once whipped the inspector in Anxi County. Who could break through Hulao Pass? He killed Lü Bu, who was so shamed that his hair was cut and his crown was pierced. His imposing manner overwhelmed the many lords. After the brothers separated, it was difficult to see each other again. It was because the troops were conscripted and the generals were few that he was trapped in Xuzhou. One, he refused to surrender to Cao and first made an oath. With a single sword, he besieged Tushan Mountain. One, he traveled far north to rely on Yuan Shao. One, in the ancient city, the troops, horses, money, and food were collected with one drumbeat. They met in the ancient city and clarified their intentions. He dispelled doubts and luckily beheaded Cai Yang. Cao's million soldiers were on the road to Dangyang. With a roar, he thrust his serpent spear. On the Changban Bridge, the water flowed backward. He released Yan Yan out of righteousness. The Shu Road was rugged, but he easily captured it. The resourceful strategist was still inferior. In front of the Wakou stronghold, he was drunk all day long. Suddenly, the crude general had a plan. He cunningly deceived Zhang Shao and secured Zhongzhou. Outside Jiameng Pass, he raised the flag and drum. He raised the double spears together, frightening gods and ghosts. He killed until the stars shifted, but the army did not retreat. He has long garrisoned Langzhong, who dares to invade? Half his life is filled with hatred for not avenging his brother. He whipped the strong soldiers and made them work again. Fan Jiang and Zhang Da stabbed his throat. If the general hesitated, he would die immediately. Why fear that the mountains and rivers would not belong to Liu? How could it lead to autumn grass growing and sadness filling the land?</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Hangye (1180) 11:15 AM to 12:00 PM Opening "Shen Fengxi Was Humiliated"</p>
<p>He has failed, the former lover said Ruan Liu. Surprisingly, her husband seeks nobility. It is difficult to say with a clear conscience. She regrets not taking up the pipa to form a conjugal relationship. But, withered willows and residual flowers, don't ask. It's just because, in the previous life, her fate was not fully fulfilled. This time, she meets again in the old place. How could I be willing to write off our past friendship. I think you, there are many red-powdered women in the world. All the same, playing the zither and drums to occupy tenderness. Not like me, bitter plums by the roadside for people to climb. Let the wild wind and rain beat my head. If I hear you say that you forgive me, I will follow you to Hangzhou. But, the general's power is boundless. How can I leave without saying goodbye? Even if I can hide temporarily, I'm afraid it will be difficult to escape to the ends of the earth. Therefore, I found it difficult to answer temporarily. Unknowingly, my face was flushed with shame. She wants to repay him with a check. She doubles the amount for you. Who knows, he tears them into pieces like butterflies. They fly to the clouds and leave nothing behind. Therefore, I took a rickshaw on the way home. My heart is full of worry.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>General Zhang's Equality</h3>
<p>On Studio Number One, they are filming the hall of the General's mansion in a natural setting.</p>
<p>The General advocates equality, and he holds an equality tea party in this hall.</p>
<p>This general is very interesting. The equality he advocates is the elimination of class distinctions. But this is not permanent; it only exists at this equality tea party, which is said to be held once a month.</p>
<p>Whether male servants, maids, cooks, gardeners, clerks, accountants, or even the coachman driving the carriage, they must all be regarded as honored guests at this tea party. The General's three pampered young ladies (played by Li Lili, Gong Zhihua, and Xu Fofen) usually receive orders and are fed by servants while eating, but at this equality tea party, they must serve tea and snacks to the maids and coachmen. If they are slow in serving, the General will impolitely reprimand them. You say, isn't this interesting?</p>
<p>Sun Yu's directorial technique is always light, humorous, and lovely. Under his handling, if it is said that it cannot make the audience laugh their tears out, no one will believe it.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Incarnation Girl"</h3>
<p>Starring Han Langen, Yuan Meiyun, Zhao Manna, and Wang Guilin</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The efforts of certain people are truly admirable. They previously made anonymous phone calls, and recently they have publicly claimed that various companies are uniting to deal with them, as if they were the authorities of those companies.</p>
<p>Confucius said: I wish to say nothing!</p>
<p>Brother Wu Han is hosting a dinner at Huibinlou tomorrow at 6:00 PM, supposedly for the special oversized issue of "Mingxing Bimonthly".</p>
<p>I remember that the call for submissions for the "Mingxing" special issue had the erroneous phrase "encourage film", and now there is a dinner invitation for me. I also remember that a certain director (called a certain director to avoid suspicion of having a "patron") once said that his work did not receive a wave of positive reviews entirely because he was used as "cannon fodder". Now, this makes me confused.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that Yuan Meiyun was crowned "Queen of Soap" and "Eastern Palace" and "Western Palace". I wonder if "revolutionary comrades" participated in the ceremony?</p>
<p>Diantong is probably hopeless for revival. According to certain people, this is naturally one of Sun Shiyi's crimes. Otherwise, why would it close later rather than sooner, and only after pointing out some "street corners"?</p>
<p>When Chen Dabe watched "Peach Blossom Prince," he said to people, "How did Li Jinhui come up with such a thing?" His words implied a lack of a "sense of beauty."</p>
<h3>Marlene Dietrich's New Film "Desire" Will Soon Be Released</h3>
<p>Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper have not worked together since "Morocco". Now, their second collaboration, "Desire", is rumored to be released soon at the Grand Theater, which is indeed noteworthy news. Not only is it directed by the great director Frank Borzage, but Ernst Lubitsch also serves as the producer. Its success is naturally expected. Paramount Pictures lists it as one of the major films of the year, which is certainly not without reason. It is a witty romance with many humorous interjections and meaningful dialogues. Marlene Dietrich's style in this film is slightly different, but her intense expression with a mysterious meaning is still present.</p>
