<p>時評</p>
<h3>冀察外交的難題</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>繼土肥原來華任華北日駐屯軍特務機關長松室孝原到津後。華北各地日武官陸續赴津會談。宋哲元秦德純蕭振瀛等亦到津與松室唔商。沉寂一時的冀察外交至是頓形活躍。現在宋留津等候華北日駐屯軍參謀長永見由日歸來冀察外交待朱興永見會晤後。當有具體的開展。延未解决的冀東僞組織取消問題。察北六縣歸還問題。和最近日方所高唱的中日共同防共問題。如果都乘這個機會有相當的歸宿。當然是我人所希望的。</p>
<p>就冀察外交而言。日方最着重的當然是共同防共一點。這就是廣田三原則中的第三項。現在日方拿這一點先來和我方折衝談判。日方高唱共同防共的眞意。便是在華北日駐屯軍强化後。要以共同防共爲藉口。把軍事勢力伸張到防共區域範圍之內。深刻些說。便是要把華北戰區地盤變相的擴充起來。日方現在提議着設置中日共同防共委員會。締結共同防共協定。而華北當局則一再表示。防共已有極缜密佈置。母庸越姐代庖。冀察外交當以此爲第一難題。</p>
<p>冀東僞組織取消問題。當土肥原未離華前。就已經過多决的折衝交涉。後來日方藉口於股汝耕的出路問題。卒使交涉陷於停頓。可見日方沒有無條件取消僞組織的意思。况且冀東僞組織。在日方卵翼下。所表現的種種非法的政治活動。又都足以映出日方的處心積慮來。例如私設査緝所。征收關說。包庇走私。爲的是破壞我關稅系。改訂敎科書。爲的是消滅我冀束同胞的民族意識。設立電台。創辦報紙通信社。爲的是作不利中國的宣傳。日方旣已在冀東造成如許旣成事實。卽使可以讓冀東偽組織取消。也必提出別的更大的交換條件。假如我們得到了取消冀東僞祖織的空名。而實際上却造成了許多新的變相戰區。損失了加倍的主權。那麽我們當然也是不願的。</p>
<p>至於察北六縣交還問題。自從僞軍李守信部强佔六縣以來。我地方當局和日方駐張垣軍事聯絡員大本已經有過多决的交涉。形勢毫無進步。現在更牽連到綏察防共問題。日方表示爲防共的緣故。察北六縣僞軍更不能輕易撤退。將來或尙須增添。這問題與共同防共問題顯已發生着聯帶關係。解决當然也是困難的。</p>
<p>總而言之。在今日華北環境之下我們僅僅用外交的理論來促醒日軍部的反省。使他們無條伴的取消戰區和僞組織。交還强佔的土地。打消華北軍事勢力伸張的計劃。恐怕是不容易的。冀察外交難局的打開。似乎還有待外交以外多方面的努力呢。</p>

<h3>中國與國聯技術合作近况</h3>
<p>— 顧惠民</p>
<p>據國際聯合會公報載稱，國聯行政院中國委員會曾於三月間開會討論中國與國聯技術合作的現勢和一九三六年的計劃。中國和國聯的技術合作方案是一九三一年開始實行的，其宗旨就在利用國聯的技術機關，來扶助中國經濟委員會，促進全國的建設工作。</p>
<p>一九三六年的計劃，仍以過去的合作方案爲根據。設在南京的技術合作辦事處繼續維特着：農村合作專家肯白爾（Cambell）期滿續訂聘的。農業是中國最重要的問題，中國經濟委員會對於這方面特別注意。近年來，鄉村合作社進步很快，國民政府知其效用甚大，並覺應參照各國合理的成規，予以推行，决定聘請第一流技術專家來華指導。國聯應中國政府之謂，派肯白爾擔任這方面的工作，肯氏前在錫蘭辦理農村合作，很有聲譽，已於一九三五年七月赴華任職，預計要有好的成績出現，還須幾年工夫。</p>
<p>意人馬里（M.B.Mari）是合作計劃下來華又一專家。他是一九三二年秋季赴華的。國聯經濟股應中國政府之請，派他考察中國絲業的發展和改良情形，他現任經濟委員會蠶絲方面的技術顧問</p>
<p>中國經濟委員會常常諮詢國聯交通運輸股；運輸股的人員也盡力指示中國政府關於公路，濬河，水利和其他有關各問題。</p>
<p>一九三五年國聯交通運輸股應中國政府之請，派出幾位優異的專家研究中國各重要問題。從一九三四年十二月至一九三五年春季，國聯四專家所組成的調査團就在中國實地作精密的初步研究，從中並採得關於技術方面很有價値的參考資料。後來經過另一專家的襄助，記載各專家研究心得的巨冊報吿就發表了。其中包括；導淮計劃，華北水道，汾河工程，治黃計劃，濬治小淸河計劃，永定河蓄水設備，長江各問題，山西水力，綏遠灌溉，和公路，交通，各問題。</p>
<p>國聯運輸股荷人鮑特滋（M.Bourdrea）一九三二年初到中國，現任經濟委員會水力工程，允其是治河計劃的專家</p>
<p>自去年國聯派遣專家考察圑來華後，交通運輸技術顧問委員會主席爲謀各惠家的建議，利於實施起見，派專家顧桑（M.Coursin）來華，顧氏是法國政府公共工程部工程師及馬特茄斯卡（Madagascar）公共工程監督。他代表國聯技術顧問委員會，和中國經濟委員會做聯絡工作，顧氏在一九三五年前往中國。他的使命要在一九三六年十月十五日才完畢，然後將觀察所得報吿技術顧問委員會主席。</p>
<p>關於衛生方面，一九二九年末中國政府早就建議要和國聯衛生股合作；一九三〇年五月國聯行政院就同意了。此後，從一九三〇年五月至一九三四年末白雪克（Dr.B.Borcie）代表國聯衛生股和中國政府衛生署在技術上協力合作，成績非常可觀。</p>
<p>史德巴（Dr.A.Stampar）是南斯拉夫公共衛生部名譽監督，前國聯衛生委員會委員，自一九三三年九月也爲中國全國經濟委員會和衛生署聘去。這是依照國聯行政院衛生委員會一九三三年七月十八日的决議案辦理的，他的任務是和經濟委員會哈作進行農村復興工作。在那時，經濟委員會决定集中全力辦理西北（陝西，甘肅）和江西兩處的建設工作。爲什麼要選這兩處先着手呢？多半是爲了那地的農業災害很深，而其中主要原因是人民和牲口的傳染病很利害，在西北允其嚴重。自一九三三年十一月起，史氏就在這幾省實地研究衛生情形，直到一九三五年底止，他在技術方面已研究過江西，湖南，四川，江西，福建，寗夏，靑海，甘肅，山西，察哈爾，綏遠，河北。</p>
<p>最近國聯行政院中國委員會，應中國代表之請，議决了一條技術合作的新途徑：就是中國經濟委員會得派專家至國外研究關於各國建設，財政，衛生，水利等問題的最新學識。這許多中國專家可以利用國聯各技術機關和秘書處的擋案和設備去學得經騐，幷査察各國行政，和建設的實際狀况。中國政府就要和國聯秘書處籌辦各種必需的手續。這些中國專家暫時算爲國聯秘書處的職員，他們在日內瓦可以得到種種便利，因爲國聯秘書處和國際勞工局的案卷可儘他們參看。各國也供給他們研究的便利和機會。他們在國聯秘書處作完初步研究後，依照秘書處所擬定的計劃，還可以組織臨時考察團到各國去探討呢。</p>

<h3>學習問題（上）　中央大學敎育院院長</h3>
<p>— 艾偉</p>
<p>學習問題屬於心理學的硏究範圍。因爲心理學是硏究一切活動——人類的和動物的——的科學，學習爲人類和動物的活動之一部份，所以學習問題是應常根據心理學來硏究的。心理學和其他科學一樣，具有一個重要的條件，就是經濟的條件。所以要討論到學習問題，我們就要講求學習經濟。換一句話說，我們對於各樣的學習要費的時間少而獲得的效果大。今天聽講的先生們聽說是全國二十餘萬中學學生。中學學生正値求學時代，對於學習方法是應當注意的。因爲方法選擇得當，則事半而功倍；吾則時間難耗得多，而效果仍然少見。這當然是不經濟，也就是不合乎科學，或不合乎心理學。今天根據心理學討論學習方法，希望諸位能照我所說的去做，這樣，我可向諸位擔保，以後讀一切的書必然費的時間少而得到的效果大。</p>
<p>甚麼叫作學習？我們不必詳細解釋，而且也沒有時間作詳細的解釋。我們不妨接受一般人對於學習的見解，不過我們要加添一名：就是學者在學習的時候必須有所反應，例如老師問小朋友「三加四等於多少」？小朋友說「等於四」，這答復是他的反應。有的時候，學習尙未成熟，他也必須反應：這反應若是對的，則他的習慣可算已經養成。所以在學習之時完全是習慣養成的問題。當我們讀書的時候，欲養成牢固的習慣，我們必須作積極的反應，消極的反應或祇是反復的練習，那是無益的。有的人手裏捧着書，眼睛望着書，在別人看來，好像他在讀書似的，其實他的反應是消極的。換句話說，他雖眼望着書而心不在焉，這樣讀下去雖讀了多少遍，費了幾點鐘，仍是學不會的。所以我們在讀書的時候應當起勁的讀，讀得特別留意。一般人常說「凡事止要在我們的心裏打了個轉的，我們總容易記得」，其實所謂「打了個轉」就是引起過積極反應的。我們在學校裏，凡是有實騐的功課，總懂得淸楚些，記得明白些，這無非是經過了積極反應之功。</p>
<p>下面對於學習分三種關係來說：　學習與身體——尤其是身體疲乏——的關係；　學習與心理——允其是情緒方面——的關係；　學習與日常生活或習慣的關係。</p>
<p>學習與疲乏我們讀書太久而不休息，身體上和精神上即感覺疲乏。關於這個問題，在一般的學生中，至少可以分爲兩種人來說。一種人是過於用功，以致身心疲乏而不自知，仍繼續的讀下去。另一種人讀書甚少即覺身心疲乏，因此停止工作，以爲冉不能讀下去，要是再讀下去就生病了。這兩種人一是太過，一是不及，所謂「過猶不及，其失均也」，這兩種人對於學習經濟都未顧到。在我們的意思是學習要經濟，而同時身心也要健康。就是我們在讀書的時候要維持身心的健康，而同時又要盡力求學，以達到最經濟的目的。我們知道，讀書持久的能力，在一般學生中，人各不同。有的讀了不久即疲乏的，但楚恢復也很容易。有的讀了很久始覺疲乏，但是欲圖恢復類不容易。這全視各人身心的强弱而定。所以究竟每日工作多少時間，始不致妨碍身心，這是很難拿一兩句話來概括的。就是所謂一日夜之間，八小時工作，八小時睡眠和八小時游戲的辦法，也不是唯一的好辦法。照我們的硏究結果：大致睡眠的時數總在八小時左右，同學中彼此相差並不甚遠。這是就一般人講，至於特別的人，自當別論。</p>
<p>爲我們的一般中學生設想，每日工作八小時，似嫌太少。假使我們的身體還不算弱，而同時對於家庭。學校或社會並沒有甚麽感覺煩悶的事，我們儘可每日花費十二小時左右去讀書，不過每天對於這些時數應當分配得當。例如讀了一兩個鐘頭的書我們就應當休息一下。這樣短時期的休息，就心理學的硏究結果上講，是很有益的。所以學校裹定的辦法，是每上一課休息五分鐘或十分鐘——最好是十分鐘。這十分鐘若是學生會利用的話，那與他的身心是非常有益的。</p>
<p>第二種人是工作太久而不目知疲乏的人。這種人對於學習似乎沒有履行經濟的條件。換句話講，他們的學習是不合乎科學的，或是不合乎心理學的。因爲我們不但要每天的工作做得多，而且要我們的工作年數久。過於疲乏而不目知，其結果是健康不能恢復。此種情况若持久下去，則成遠年疲勞，因此將發生種種瘋在病態。例如在美國當林肯總統時代，有財政部長齊天敦（Chiltenden）者，在七十二小時內繼續不斷的簽了十一萬五千張銀行鈔票，其結果神經損壊不可恢復。又波士敦病院一日來一發生瘋狂病的農夫，經醫生考査之後，於其家族史上並未發見有患瘋在病者。再究其個人生活，乃知此人爲一送牛乳者，每晨二時起床，從事工作，至晚十時方止。此外彼尙從事耕種。如是四五年，以一人而兼兩三人之工作，從不休息，所以他太覺疲乏了甚而至於瘋在。醫生的治療方法是讓他休息，給他以比較好的食物，使他有充分的睡眠。結果在一年半以內，他的病居然好了。</p>
<p>所以工作太久或過於疲勞，是一件很危險的事。我們如果要知道疲乏之後如何纔算是恢復了，有一種很簡單的測騐，就是每夜一睡之後淸晨起來頭腦是不是感覺淸楚。假使我們的頭腦是淸楚的，那證明我們的精神已經恢復了。倘若每早起來，頭腦還覺得不淸楚，那就證明我們的精神還沒有恢復。常常如此，那就很危險了。</p>

<h3>海順輪進口　撞壞東鐵碼頭</h3>
<p>為避讓渡船而起　今日將派員勘騐</p>
<p>本埠海昌輪船公司之海順號輪、此决自營口開來上海、在船到浦江後、因讓避渡船、碰撞碼頭、後又撞及駁船損失頗大、茲將本館記者從各方面調査所得之情形、分報如下、</p>
<p>運貨進口　海順輪載重一七四四噸、船長二八五英尺四寸、闊三四英尺二寸、深〇二英尺四寸、吃水一七英尺五寸、係一八九七年造自德國、每小時可行十海厘、向行上海北洋班、今回該輪由從牛莊龍口運貨來滬、前日上午七時十五分、該輪開進吳淞、經過東鐵碼頭尙未至楊家波碼頭前、因避讓渡船與小倫、致與東鐵碼頭猛撞、</p>
<p>側讓渡船　在海順輪前行至楊家渡碼頭時、浦東忽有小火輪一艘名的翰號者、拖帶渡船一艘、由浦東開赴浦西、乘客幾及百人、在海順輪前面開過、此時海順輪開行速度頗快、突見前首橫過一渡船、情形十分危險、萬一相撞、則全船乘客、必致盡行落水、發生極大慘劇、如海順倒車、必致不及、海順船主此時祇得避重就輕、向左側讓開、不意竟撞上碼頭、</p>
<p>撞壊碼頭　東鐵碼頭在楊家度棧之下、最前為大倉碼頭、海順為讓約翰小輪與渡船、輪體側左、而稍後退、適在東鐵碼頭之前、以致船身與東鐵碼頭猛撞、（渡船則已保全矣）東鐵碼頭被碰、因海順輪爲重儎、故損壊頗巨、而在碼頭外擋、尙停有裝貨之駁船兩艘、同時亦被海順輪猛撞、兩駁均皆損壊、出事之後、除由船主會同碼頭管理員騐勘外、海順輪仍開大倉棧卸貨、</p>
<p>本日勘驗　前日因値封關、昨日已由船主將此事之原因經過、詳報海昌公司、而海昌公司亦先派員到船上査詢、並至碼頭勘騐一過、復根據船主報吿、轉呈海關與航政局、一面則通知保險行、請於今日派騐船師及工程人員、並査撞壊之碼頭與駁船、再估計損失、以便進交涉、及修理賠償之事、此决海順雖肇禍而未及度船、亦不幸中之大幸也、</p>

<h3>我國今後　建築的作風應如何轉變</h3>
<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>今天這個問題、極爲重要、論理、不是我這沒有學過建築的人人、所能有所主張的、但是這問題、確是我國今後應該設法解答的問題、其原因如下、</p>
<p>（一）我國的建築、在世界建築史上、本來占一大位置、而且具有特長、但近來因文化衰落、這種學問藝術日見低下、而且有許多不合時宜的地方、譬如以前每用木材爲主耍材料、此後勢不可能、又平面占地太廣之類、如不改良、將連固有的特長、一同煙滅、</p>
<p>（二）一國建築、乃文化之代表、亦可說是一種結晶、尤其是與民族意識有特殊的關係、故至少應保全固有之特點與精神、並自由選取某一種或數種之作派、而咀嚼消化之、以資營養、</p>
<p>（三）我國建築現狀、可稱爲混雜的、無動向的、或者不適應需要的、如此下去、要影響到一般民族的精神、與經濟學術事業、其情形很爲嚴重、</p>
<p>因此之故、我們不可當這個問題是一個泛泛的問題、應當認爲迫切而重要的、</p>
<p>但全國的人、似乎至今沒有十分注意、就速建築學者。建築業者、好像也是忙於應付日常的事務、而來不及研究到這個問題、所以兄弟忘記了自己有無資格、而利用這回的機會、來促起同人的注意與研究、這便是兄弟今天講這個問題的原故、話雖如此、但這問題的解答、談何容易、恐怕連建築學，建築業。的同人一起來切實研究幾年、尙不能得一好的結論、但這問題實在是非解答不可的、因爲自民國十七年起、全國積極建設、每年至少用五六十萬元、再建築上十年便五六萬萬、大的現在總已用掉二三萬萬了、以後尙年有增加、如再照現狀因循下去、怎樣對得起國家與社會、所以如何解答這問題、不但是建築學者。建築業者的責任，而且是一般國民的責任，</p>
<p>現在把我的很簡淺的意見、提供大衆的參考、並不是說就算解决了這問題、在我的一面亦不過是擬議而假定的、</p>
<p>因時代的關係、我國以木材爲主力的一點，巳不能不打破、同時各種材料方面、裝飾方面、工具方面、都因之而起變化、</p>
<p>又因時代關係、我國利用大地盤的一點、又將遂漸變遷、因此全部的配置、部分的結構、以至材料方面、裝飾方面、亦自然隨之變化、這都是不可避免的、至於一作風（就是所有形式與功用如何組織聯屬使之調和增進、）爲了上文所說三種關係、應該產生一種現代的中國的建築法式與意匠、我不贊成把外國的東西生呑活剝囫圇的嚥下去、亦不贊成一定要把古舊的遺傳物、傳統的因襲下去、</p>
<p>尤不贊成盲從一知半解的人東拼西凑、東鈔西襲說這是中國式西洋式、</p>
<p>因爲世間每一事物、都不是可以如此簡單來武斷的冒充的、我國從前文化、的確不能說是不偉大、但自五代及宋元以後、實在欠缺進步、建築是文化之</p>
<p>一、自亦不能例外、</p>
<p>這個緣故、就是不能創造、又不能吸收消化外來之精華而成爲一個新產物、所以一天一天的退步了、</p>
<p>今天我們謀建築作風的轉變、第一就要從這裏着眼、因此之故、我們决不要爲固有的外來的作風所束縛牢籠、（但不是說對固有外來的就不加硏究、而且要深切的研究、我知道中國營造學社苦幹了十年、經朱桂莘先生的慘淡經營、梁思成。劉士能。兩君的努力工作、對固有的建築、尙未硏究到一半、就是宋以前的實物、亦因圖籍太少、難以窮追、至專門研究外來建築的機關、尙無所聞、我深盼亦有象中國營造學社一樣的機關、埋頭苦幹、把歐·美·日本·以迄土耳其·印度·等各類建築、認眞研究、庶幾將來雙方互證、可以發見一條很光明平坦的大路、）</p>
<p>又當然不是贊成如當今淺薄粗浮的所謂創造、我不能列舉我國應當轉變成一種如何如何的作風、因爲我不是專家、而且這問題本難以率然答覆、但可以抽象的說、我國的文化特點是渾厚和美的、（即總理所標之忠孝仁愛信義和平）建築旣爲文化特徵之一、當然應融化此種精神在內、故凡反乎此四字者、即應在所不取、（不論其爲固有的外來的）母須有所游移、（因此可知明淸兩代建築中之趨於纖巧浮薄者、並不足取法、而外國象微鬥爭等作派、亦非吾所當有也、）反之、則應儘量保存與吸收、</p>
<p>目下新建築中能合此條件者、似乎極稀、故可判决爲全國用了數萬萬元而未會獲得合乎時宜的產物、</p>
<p>這是很可惜的、時光易過、金錢不易得、如此就隨波逐流的去了、國家民族的盛衰與文化之盛衰、是表裹的、這並不是一句空話、一個新興的民族、能把他的强幹的精神、偉大的氣魄、表現到建築上去、歷史上不乏其例、吾們瞻仰到埃及的拉美索斯玉廟。金字塔。同尼羅河一樣的令人感覺到偉大莊嚴、看到希臘的伯德嫩廟。羅馬的鬥獸場、就是殘留的幾根石柱、幾塊彫刻、我們立刻迴想到希臘的羅馬民族的無遠不屆的、文化武功、就在這殘柱片石的本身、已够表現他們美術家的心血、他工料的代價、國家的經營、合成這樣的結晶、足以令人與起、近古的羅馬聖彼得敎堂以當時復興文化、表現宗敎上的權威、巴黎的宮殿、表現法蘭西皇族的尊嚴、</p>
<p>我國的燉煌雲崗的石窟、龍鬥的造像、棲霞的舍利塔、多是漢魏隋唐時代美術的結晶、而且有很大的政治經濟背景、</p>
<p>不論材料是石的、木的、磚瓦的、因材爲用、因地制宜、時代的文化、是和建築相表裏、再進一說一朝的文化艱難奮鬥的勃興、到萎靡蕪雜而敗亡、亦無不可在建築上一一表現出來、我國今日對建築的悲觀、就是對時局悲觀的大因素、所以大家講文化復興、講和平奮鬥的、今天諸君對這個問題的解答並實行、是有重大責任的、再有一說、現代各國的建築、多趨重在樸素渾厚充量的表現結構上的要點、使用上的要點、這也因時代的關係、不能不顧到經濟衛生種種方面、而且與國家社會結構的演變亦相因而起的、我們不能忘記大衆的需耍及時代的要求、叉不應抹煞了本位的文化、所以亦不妨假定拿固有建築的優點做基礎、來認眞的改良一下、譬如靑海·西藏·的許多的喇嘛廟、便似乎很合時代性的高樓之用、</p>
<p>總之、我國遭遇、在歷史上這樣重要的一個時期、在危險的過，渡中、要產生一種新文化不是容易的事、盼望諸君努力、大衆努力、庶幾鄙人所說、不是一篇廢話、</p>

<h3>金城銀行二十四年份營業報告中　中國經濟現狀之分析</h3>
<p>金城銀行民國二十四年份營業報告書、本月十二日開股東常會時公布、內容關於國內外經濟及金融狀况、敘述甚詳、殊為有價値之作、茲因為限於篇幅、僅能將「中國經濟現狀之分析」一章摘錄如次、以介紹於讀者、</p>
<p>中國整個經濟之現狀、譬之療疾、不明癥結、則將無由施其方藥、國民經濟建設亦猶是、首須明其實况、察其要鍵所在、而後凡所策劃、方有準繩、愛將我國農業·礦產·工業·交通·等現狀略述如下、</p>
<p>農業　近四年來平均全國糧食生產數量、計稻米為八九五·二〇〇千市担、小麥為四四六·七〇〇千市担、甘薯二四一·五〇〇千市担、其餘高梁小米玉米等同在一二萬担左右、稻米以長江區之皖贛湘鄂川五省所產最多、幾佔全國米產總額之半、其西南區之桂黔滇三省、則佔百分之七、小麥出產最多者為沿海區、佔全國總產額百分之四十四、其次為黃河區之豫陜晋察綏五省、佔百分之二十七、長江區之皖贛湘鄂川五省、佔百分之二十四、至於西南區之桂黔滇及西北區之新寗甘靑四省、所產極微、小米之產量亦以沿海區冀魯江浙閩粵為冠、佔全國總生產百分之五十四、其次為黃河區之豫陜晋察綏、得百分之三十八、玉米高梁生產亦均以沿海區冀魯江浙閩粵六省為主要、各佔全國總產量百分之五十以上、此我國糧食生產之大槪也、棉花為主要之衣料、近四年來全國每年平均產棉一五·五四〇·〇〇〇市担、沿海冀魯江浙閩粵各省、佔全國總產額百分之五十五、長江區之皖贛湘鄂川五省、佔百分之二十三、黃河區豫陜晋察綏五省、亦佔百分之二十以上、此外西北區之新寗甘靑四省、及西南區之桂黔滇三省、每年所產尙不及二十萬担、</p>
<p>綜觀上述各種糧食生產數量、皆集中沿海長江二區、米產合佔全國總產量百分之九十二、麥產合佔百分之六十八、主要衣料如棉花之生產、亦以沿海區最佔重要、</p>
<p>近年以來水旱蟲害、毀損作物、罌粟毒草、侵佔農田、益以土地利用方法之幼稚、農場面積之狹小、在在足以减少農產之收穫、造成糧食衣料之進口糧食計米穀二五·九二八·九六二市担、小麥一〇·四一八·一七四市担、麪粉一·〇二〇·九九二市担、若以二十二年至本年三年平均進口、米穀二二·三五〇·九九六市担、小麥一三·六五八·八五二市担、麪粉二·〇〇〇·二三七市担、然我國糧食不足之數尙遠過於此數、據估計輸入糧食僅相當於不足糧食百分之二十二、此足證國民消費之未充、一部人民未獲相當之營　也、年來棉產固有增加、然仍不敷消費、平均每年入超當在二萬担左右、可知民食居衣之不足自給為數甚鉅也、</p>
<p>礦業　我國煤礦儲量頗豎、僅次於美國及加拿大、據地質調查所報告、全國約計二千四百八十二萬八千七百萬公噸、相當於英德兩國之兩倍、或日本之三十餘倍、其中以黃河區豫陜晋察綏等省蘊藏最富、計二千〇六十六萬二千二百萬噸、約佔全國煤儲百分之八十有奇、長江西北沿海西南等區、合計約三百七十萬萬噸、佔百分之十四左右、儲景雖富、產量則頗低微、年產、僅約二千八百萬公噸、以沿海區冀魯江浙閩粵所產最多、約佔總產量四成左右、煤礦中之最大者當屬撫順與開澟、前者係南滿鐵路所經營、資本一萬萬日金、每年產煤七百五十萬噸、後者係中英合辦、資本二百萬金鎊、年產煤八百萬噸、完全由中國資本興辦者當首推中興、年約產煤一百三十餘萬噸、較之開澟相去仍遠、至於煤礦開採成本、開澟每噸僅及二元二角、而中興則為三元五角、長興公司竟至五元、加以運費之高昂、捐稅之繁重、本國煤產益不能與外煤抗衡矣、</p>
<p>石油無論在國防工業交通各方面、皆佔特殊重要之地位、年來國內公路建設突飛猛晋、航空軍事等亦日見發展、石油之需要乃與日俱增、我國石油會計師、據估計極形貧乏、民國九年美國地質調查所曾發表中國石油儲藏量、估計為一·三七五兆桶、分佈於陜川甘新諸省、加以遼省撫順之頁岩油、儲量一·八九九兆桶、合計全國儲油量為三·二七四兆桶、至於石油產量更為貧乏、現在生產者計天然油有陜之延長石油官礦、川之自流井一帶鹽場、以及廿新等數處製煉油、除撫順等處不計外、關內僅有井陘煤礦之石家莊煉焦廠、合計關內油產每年平均不過三千桶、或十二萬六千加侖、而每年進口油料則達二萬四千萬加侖、而每年進口油料則達二萬四千萬加侖、本國生產者僅及輸入量二千分之一、</p>
<p>我國鐵礦儲量極形貧乏、據地質調查所之估計、全國總儲量約計十萬〇〇十九萬餘噸、僅得世界鐵礦儲量千分之六、其中四分之三條在關外、其餘四分之一則分佈於察鄂冀皖等省、察佔百分之九、鄂佔百分之五、冀佔百分之三、皖佔百分之二、其他各省合佔百分之六、鐵砂生產近年平均約二百二三十萬噸、日人經營之鞍山本溪湖兩礦、已佔全國產量百分之三十七、餘如鄂之漢冶萍象鼻山、皖之裕繁寶興福利民、產量合計佔百分之四十四、然此項礦產全係輸往日本、合上述鞍山本溪湖兩礦生產計之、中國鐵礦生產百分之八十以上、係輸往日本者、</p>
<p>工業　中國之近代棉紡業距今已有四十餘年之歷史、本國紗廠之地域分佈、則多集中於沿海一帶、九十二廠中在沿海江浙冀魯四省者達六十九廠、而上海一埠竟多至三十一廠、其餘鄂晋兩省各六廠、豫省四廠、紗錠數目之分佈狀况相若、其地域分佈之不均昭然若揭矣、織布工業發達亦久、現全國織機計二萬九千五百七十九台、惟各廠資本微薄、平均每廠僅及二萬元、產布數量總計為一五·二五四·一五三疋、以我國人口之多、此數實嫌過少、故每年布疋仍有大宗輸入、布廠之地域分配與紗廠情形相同、上海一埠即達二百十三廠、江浙二省合計估五分之三以上、長江區各省共十三廠、黃河區各省十二廠、規模皆屬狹小、機製麺粉業為我國新興工業之一、全國麺粉廠共五十六家、資本二四·五二五·〇〇〇元、年約產粉六四·九六三·〇〇〇袋、尙不足全國麺粉消費四分之一、不足之數均以士製麺粉及輸入洋粉為挹注、麺粉廠之地域分佈、亦偏於沿海諸省、計冀魯蘇三省麺粉廠達四十五家、佔資本總額四分之三及生產總額百分之八十七以上、</p>
<p>化學工業中之酸鹼工業、在國防上甚為重要、我國製酸工廠現有六家、在上海者三家、天津二家、廣西一家、其中除一家係英商外、餘均華人經營、華資五廠可產鹽酸年達五九·七五〇擔、硫酸一一〇·二一〇擔、惟硝酸尙付缺如、國內酸類消費日趨增加、年有大量進口、如民國二十三年進口鹽酸二〇·三九八公擔、硝酸二九·六一五公擔、硫酸一三·一七二公擔、可見我國生產量尙遠不敷用、製鹼工廠現共五家、一在上海、一在塘沽、一在漢沽、二在四川、每年產量共達七五七·一〇〇擔、其中永利一廠佔六三三·〇〇〇擔、此外天然鹼之生產年約六一〇·〇〇〇擔、自海外輸入者亦不在少、水泥工廠全國共計六家、資本二千萬元、年產約七百四十萬擔、為量已屬不少、然仍不敷用、近年進口仍達三百七十萬擔、火柴工業年來發展頗速、然以外貨傾銷之故、生產反形過剩、皮革工業以價格低廉、國產皮革尙能足用、實屬難得、機器造紙工業全國共四十餘家、資本五百五十萬元、生產總額總値將近千萬元、土法造紙全國約有紙槽五萬六千戶、生產價値最近巳减至一千七百萬元、合計本年生產紙値二千七百萬元、然我國每年消費紙張價値共達六千六百萬元以上、洋紙之輸入年在四千萬元左右、</p>
<p>我國家機器製造工業資本缺乏、規模狹小、不足與外國工廠相比、全國計資本在十萬元以上者十二家、萬元以上者八十家、三千元以上者一四四家、資本總額四·二九六〇〇〇元、產品總値一〇·一五二·〇〇〇元、資本在十萬元以上者、不出江浙兩省、而又多集中於滬埠、在一萬元以上者亦散佈於沿海數省、各廠所製多屬簡單機件、至於精細龐大者仍仰給於舶來、</p>
<p>交通　公路建設民國十六年以後進展甚速、至二十三年止通車里數達九八·〇〇〇公里、各省長度粵省首屆一指、計一萬一千二百餘公里、魯晋皖各省次之、各在四千公里以上、桂蘇浙鄂又次之、而以靑海及西康為最少、各僅數百公里、</p>
<p>我國之鐵道長途、據民國二十三年之統計、共一萬八千公里、其中屬國有者佔全國鐵路長途百分之六十以上、民營者佔百分之十三、外人承辦者佔百分之十七、國有鐵道之分佈以沿海區之冀魯江浙閩粵儲省為最多、佔國有鐵道百分之四十四、東北區次之、佔百分之二十五、黃河中游陜晋綏豫察諸省又次之、佔百分之二十一、長江中游皖贛湘鄂四省、僅佔百分之十、西北及西南各省則幾無鐵道可言、</p>
<p>據交通部統計、全國商船總噸數共四十餘萬噸、僅得日本十分之一、佔世界航運噸數千分之六、近海航路以上海為中心、廣州天津為南北兩端之集中點、內河航運則自南往北、無不有航業之經營、惟因雨量氣候關係、華北及東北各河之航運、不如長江及西江之便利、</p>
<p>財政　財政為政府發展經濟之主要工具、我國中央財政歷年收入約九萬元左右、其中稅收所佔比例最大、約當全額十分之八、次之為國內公債、約佔全額十分之二、關稅鹽稅兩項佔稅收總額百分之八十以上、其次為統稅烟酒稅收總額百分之八十以上、其次為統稅烟酒稅百分之十五强、以上四項均屬間接之消費稅、至於稅收之地域分配、沿海區冀魯江浙閩粵六省佔全額十分之八强、長江區皖贛湘鄂川五省佔十分之一·五、黃河區豫陜晋察綏五省佔十分之〇·三、西南區桂黔滇三省佔十分之〇·二、此種現象實為我國經濟重心偏於沿海區之反映、就支出言、軍務費所佔較大、恒在十分之四左右、債務費佔十分之三上下、他如交通實業外交敎育等合計不過十分之二三耳、</p>
<p>華北　華北冀魯晋察綏五省、際今日之情形、如歷久不變、將由腹地淪為邊張重鎭、地位特殊、經濟重要尤應有明確之前認識、特為單獨論列、以促國人之注意、冀魯晋察綏五省農產、以小麥高粱小米玉米大豆棉花烟葉等為主、尤以小麥為最重要、小麥之產於華北者為一二七·一四三千市擔、佔全國總產量三分之一、高粱之產量亦佔全國三分之一、玉米及烟葉之產量均佔全國四分之一、大家豆佔五分之一、棉花園佔全國產量三分之一、小米則為二分之一、棉花與烟葉二項泰半外銷、為大宗出口商品、小麥高粱小米及玉米等則以自給為主、濱海之冀魯兩省淦業頗為發達、漁民數佔全國五分之一以上、而晋察綏等省之牧畜事業亦頗可觀、以五省合計、則牛馬頭數佔全國十分之一以上、猪羊佔六分之一以上、騾驢佔四分之一以上、騾驢多供載重之用、牛羊猪之副產品、如皮毛猪鬃即為出口商品之大宗、以言礦產、則首推煤鐵、冀魯晋察綏五省之煤儲、佔全國煤儲百分之四五、山西一省即得百分之五二、而五省煤產亦佔全國煤產百分之四三、冀佔百分之二四、魯佔百分之一一、晋佔百分之八、綏察合計則不及百分之一、至於五省鐵礦儲量、則佔全國鐵儲百分之十三、計察佔百分之九、冀佔百分之三、魯佔百分之一、煤鐵以外冀魯晋察綏五省鹽產約全國三分之一、自然鹼佔百分之四十、石綿佔百分之四九、硝礦佔百分之二九、即高嶺土及金產高亦蘊藏頗富、至於工業、中國最大之工業、當推棉紡業、全國共有紗錠佔百八十一萬枚、而冀魯晋察綏五省佔全國錠數百分之十八、其中魯佔百分之十、冀佔百分之六、晋佔百分之二、全國麺粉廠（東北除外）年產粉六千五百萬袋、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之二七、其中魯佔百分之十三、冀佔百分之一二、晋綏合佔百分之二、全國火柴廠年產火柴七十二萬箱、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之三七、其中魯佔百分之二五、冀佔百分之一二、全國電氣業之發電容量為三十四基雜瓦特、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之二五、其中冀佔百分之一七、魯佔百分之七、晋佔百分之一、他種工業冀魯晋察綏五省之地位亦甚重要、天津之地毯業為我國出口之大宗、秦皇島之耀華為我國著名之玻璃廠、塘沽之久大永利為我國之化學工業鉅壁其產品之運銷國外者為數亦較巨、烟台之花邊業及髪網業、高陽之人造絲布、北平之藝術工業等、俱為華北之重要工業、以交通工具論、華北交通發展較早、近年進展雖較綏慢、然仍為國內交通便利之區、而尤以鐵路為然、除東北外、全國國有鐵路約九千公里、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之五一、計冀佔百分之二五、魯佔百分之一四、晋綏各佔百分之五、察省佔百分之三四、國有鐵路中、平漢北寗津浦平綏膠濟及正太六綫、或全綫或大部皆在華北五省境內、以公路言、全國可通車公路為八萬千五公里、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之一五、計魯佔百分之六、察佔百分之三、冀晋綏各佔百分之二、除東北不計外、全國註冊船舶之載重量為六十二萬噸、冀魯晋察綏五省佔百分之九、計烟台佔百分之五五、天津佔百分之三、靑島佔百分之一、以貿易言、冀魯晋察綏五省之對外貿易、集中於冀魯二省之天津秦皇島膠州烟台龍口威海衛六關、其額約佔全國對外貿易額百分之一九、計天津佔百分之一一、膠州佔百分之五、其他四關合佔百分之三、其轉口貿易亦佔全國該項總額百分之二十左右、更以金融財政言、全國銀行總行一五九處、冀魯晋察綏五省五一三處、即十分之一、分行一·一八八處、五省佔二五九處、卽五分之一、以財政、則冀魯晋察綏五省佔中央稅收五分之一以上、地方稅收佔全國五分之一、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>沈嗣良昨返滬談　田徑預選先辦訓練班　籃球訓練七十天西洋拳術自費派送　足球隊在滬三場比賽秩序業已排定</h3>
<p>北上接洽世這田徑預選之中華全國體育恊進會總幹事沈嗣良氏、已於昨晨由平公畢返滬、記者特往趨訪、據談我參加世運進行頗順利、茲將各情分述如下、</p>
<p>田徑預選在滬舉行</p>
<p>據沈氏談、此次北上任務、大半已見前日各報北平通訊、惟關於議案中世運代表預選案之（丙）項、謂田徑預選、將在上海主辦萬國田徑比賽、以便從中　選一節、略有出入、蓋屆時名義仍為世運田徑預選、惟將由恊進會邀請滬上各團田徑名將參加、以資競爭、此事將由恊進會於兩星期內邀集西人經旅負責人、加以商討、此次預選係集全國之精銳、實力強經、恐方人方面、屆時或將以無競爭可能、不願參加、故萬國賽與世運預選、在性質上絕然不同、不可混為一事、</p>
<p>籃球訓練定七十天</p>
<p>至籃球代表隊在平受訓日期、現已決定為七十天、至六月十日結束、定六月二十日在滬集中、在十日至二十日之十天內、為各選手自由料理私事、六月二十六日、奧田徑有用國術競走舉重拳擊等一同出國、至游泳代表、將由港　方面選拔、惟選派人數、現尚未定、俟體恊會方面接得報告後、約下月初旬方可定奪、前傅郭振恒陳振興楊秀瓊三人業已被選一節、係屬揣測之詞、惟依照三君已往成績論、頗有被選資格耳、至游泳之選拔標準、　將依最近成績而定、如以前頗享盛名而現在已退步者、勢將捨去不選、</p>
<p>足球在滬比賽秩序</p>
<p>我世運足球隊正式名單、二三日內即可確定公佈、赴港之容啟兆周家騏兩君、不久即將先行返滬、至代表隊在港尚有兩場練習賽、定於二十二日自港啟程來滬、在滬將作三場習賽、已決定二十五日對葡萄牙、二十六日對上海西聯隊、二十九日對上海中華華隊、地點均在中國、代表隊或將赴南京一行、在京並擬作表演賽一場、與賽隊、現正在接洽中、日期為本月三十日、當晚返滬、定五月二日先行出國、周歷南洋各　、已約定二十場比賽、最後在英倫與全體代表隊會晤、偕同赴德、</p>
<p>解釋增派拳擊名額</p>
<p>再叩以拳擊預選事宜、據稱此次拳擊選手、係由三十二軍保送、蓋三十二軍軍長商震氏極注重軍隊體育、我國參加世運項目中、原無西洋拳擊項目、嗣商氏為使該項人材獲得世界知識起見、派員參加、但因格於世運規則、不能單獨向大會報告、故函請體育會辦理、而加入世運代表國中、經費一項、概由三十二軍担任、此次本人赴平、亦曾與三十二軍當局接洽、明晚（即十四日）在西青舉行之拳擊比賽中、即將　定該軍保送之選手、</p>
<p>張伯苓氏將不赴德</p>
<p>記者復叩以近日中華競走會史友惠先生、有對於競走放棄之說、沈氏慎重答稱、體恊會方面、並非不願增加名額、實限於經費之支配、至以拳擊方面增加名額相責難者、事實上拳擊經費、概由三十二軍自備、其與世運代表國有所不同、已如上述、恐中華競走會方面、亦未明此中情形、故深明各界能予以諒解、沈氏末稱、此行過津下車、訪晤張伯苓氏、詢以能否一同赴德、張氏以校務事　、不克前往參加、至體恊會常會、將於兩星期以內召集云、</p>
<p>田徑訓練二十開始</p>
<p>（北平特訊）我國參加世運田徑賽代表、預選訓練班、原定本月十六日開始訓練、頃因時間過於短促、一時籌備不</p>
<p>及、故改於本月二十日開始、仍在北平西郊國立清華大學訓練、至五月二十五日止、即日起向上海全國體恊會報名、只限男性、本月十八日起至二十日止、在清華大學體育部報到、十八日前清華不負責招待、參加訓練者必須合格測驗標準、方可報名、（測驗標準與參加全國世運田徑預選標準相同）及格與否、旅費概歸自備、參加訓練者、並須於報到三日後、受標準測驗一次、及格者由體恊會供給食宿、並於訓練期止時、在最後一次測驗標準及格者、始由全國體恊會供給赴滬參加預選路　、第一次測驗不及格者、不能參加訓練、但成績相差無幾者、如由該會許可、亦可參加訓練、日後測驗及格時、即由及格日起、受平等待遇、全體訓練人員均須遵守一切訓練規則、及清華大學校規、指導由馬約翰擔任、夏翔李仲三分任助敎、訓練班簡則草案業由馬氏擬定、業已寄滬、交全國體恊會常董會　核通過、即可公佈云、（瑾）</p>
<h3>我國手球名將六人　參加本屆公開手球賽　二十日起開始比賽</h3>
<p>西僑青年會主辦之公開手球單雙打賽、定於昨日截止報名、二十日起舉行比賽、我國手球名將、對於此項國際性之競賽、均抱有極大雄心、冀得占居高席、據該會宣稱、我國參加雙打者三組、　朱寬與孫道　、　華鳳罔與嚴培秋、　孫素祿與何碩庚、單打方面除孫道　與嚴培秋二人、以職務所　、不克　暇參加外、其餘一列參戰、詳細名單及比賽程序、一俟編就、即行公佈、</p>
<h3>埠際友誼賽　上海擊敗國聯　結果五比二</h3>
<p>天津十三日專電、滬與津國聯足球賽十三午後二時三刻在英球場舉行、天陰微　、時落時止、地濕球重、不易着力、四時五分　、五比三滬　津、波賽利踢中二只、格林勃踢中一雙、滬隊十七日離津南返、</p>
<p>開賽初、滬隊中鋒麟經因事南返、由格林勃代替、餘位置無更改、實力與聯絡均欠佳妙、三分　時津隊五鋒擠進、永泉邊開、叩中一球、以後津方氣勢極盛、攻門不已、滬祇有支拒功夫、十五分時、又為瓊司所乘、再中一雙、滬　變策完全取守、至三十分始稍轉機、由福恩傅　得法、波賽利　關趕上、　中、嗣津左內鋒約翰遜、中衛拉瑞、先後負傷出場、以九人應戰、作困　鬥、一比二結束上半時、</p>
<p>下半時津以預備員補充成軍、滬格林勃與波賽利更易位置、均呈活躍、開始未久、波賽利在敵足下奪得一球、帶至十五碼處、踢中、格林勃在十五分鐘後、亂軍混戰中、踢入一雙、旋又在敵門前肉搏、擠入一雙、以後雙方各有攻擊、機會均失、差之毫厘、至末二分鐘、文奎得中衛接濟、帶至門前、輕挑中的、</p>
<p>關洵安談、球場地上多浮土、下則堅硬、天雨球濕、舉足每多失誤、第一日賽失敗、多緣於此、</p>

<h3>糧食　停市期內洋麥頻漲　標粉買氣特盛</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初定繼則激提之象、洋麥報價、停市期內、芝加哥近期扯漲四角零、還好一二角、坎拿大近好二三角、遠好一二角、市塲人心、初以天時良好、人心平穩、旋以雜糧物價一致良好、業內外均加注意、故買氣頗暢、市面即好一二分、迨至下午開盤、因雜糧市面仍好、大連及北路諸帮、均少數買進、人心遂又步佳、此種情形、半屬幣制問題之餘波、半屬關乎存底之枯薄、故在未出新之前、一時難看鬆動云、</p>
<h3>新麥激漲一角餘</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份均見激漲、因目下存底不厚、新麥年收叉遙遙無期、業內外人心、因各種物價均看上勢、復傳進口碎米、有加稅之謠、有此連帶牽動、人心遂一致激昂、空頭又起而補進、各月份均漲起五六分、迨至下午開盤、因買氣依然良好、空戶又無新籌碼放出、市面仍復上騰、六月份漲勢更激、至一角二分之巨、餘亦達一角左右、照此情形、恐一時尙難回鬆、現麥穩固如常、開山東瑤灣麥五元三角二分、漢口麥四元九角二分、由福新辦二千包、阜豐辦一千五百美國小麥、因政府收成估計利多、西南雨量不足、空頭補進而漲、</p>
<h3>洋碎米改征全稅　客秈突漲二三角</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、高决各擋一律上升、因有囤戶活動、市上人心一致上騰、且以洋米加稅、形勢更見緊張、各米一律飛漲二三角、全日開出江西米三千二百多包、溫台米三千四百包、江北米一千五百包、湘米一百〇九包、大部份爲囤戶辦去、本街實銷反占少數云、</p>
<p>洋碎米以前祇完半稅、昨當局公布征收全稅、往日征稅七角半者今加至一元五六角、此後來源或難合划、惟已定之暹暹碎米及路貨應吾征稅、當成問題也、</p>
<h3>杜米為客秈帶起</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共二十餘號、貨近五午石、本街銷場初則平淡、惟午市聞客尖嚴漲三角、有活潑之象、市况頓見上升、若厚早粳價提起一角、薄稻包胃亦有天津塘沽烟台等帮辦二千餘包、故行情同升角砠不等、杜洋尖隨加角外、陰變元亦帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十四五船、市上各貨去胃轉活、客方因產區價帛、致喊緊而脫、市價白粳轉緊一角左右、薄稻亦緊數分、羊杜客尖亦見緊勢、埠尖定立、白元陰元亦帶緊勢、其餘各貨均堅立、</p>
<h3>連電報漲　標準油豆一致飛騰</h3>
<p>糧所臨時徵收特證</p>
<p>標凖豆油、因大連電訊、逐步報高、本埠存底、則異常枯薄、而各路銷場、均有問津、市上頗有供不應求之勢、因此人心激昂、本月份開價即漲一元之巨、遠期各月份、亦高漲六七八角不等、迨至下午開盤、因買氣依然旺暢、市價續騰、結果本月份漲一元、五月份漲一元二角、六月份漲九角半、七月份漲八角、八月份漲八角半、九月份漲九角半、黃豆亦因連電報好、四月份計漲四角三分、五月份漲二角二分、標準芝蔴、亦因存　吿罄、來源不繼、近日洋莊又有動收、故本月份亦漲叫角七分、五月份漲六角、按去年黃豆與芝蔴均屬歉收、一經大帮銷辦、市價易於飛騰也</p>
<p>昨日標準油餅豆市價飛騰之後、糧所爲预防意外起見、乃援例由理事會議定增收特別證金、標油證金計爲三百元、標餅爲二百元、標豆爲四百兀、至於現貨因標準野漲、人心不免向上、但交易略見减少、計四平街現豆成交三車、價漲二分、路貨開五車、行情不動、車豆無成交、杜豆沙黃漲角許、成交一千三百餘包、南洋溫台帮、銷塲仍勁、市面俏俐、豆餅祗長德廠開出四牌餅一千五百片、價爲二元零二分、豆油花生油均漲二角、照目下趨勢、標準野漲、出於休市幾日、致有一元許上落、照現貨氣象、聞連市稍回、人心不若前之狂暴、故其大局、或許暫轉止境、後情再度盤旋、</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗做開二百包</h3>
<p>售價稍昂</p>
<p>標凖紗花閃掃墓節封關停市、惟現紗市塲、昨日略有到市集會、但生意未旺、成交二百包光景、廣東帮購辦爲勤、售價較停市以前稍昂、大概平靜云、</p>
<h3>標紗存賑範圍擴大</h3>
<p>金融界金業公債商集中做多</p>
<p>華商紗布交易金鷄標凖棉紗存賑數量、至四月九日截止、査四月期成交四萬五千四百包、五月期七萬四千八百包、六月期八萬六千包、七月期八萬一千九百包、八月期七萬三千五百包、九月期一萬二千九百五十包、總計之十七萬四千五百五十包、多空兩存賬軋過凈存數爲九萬二千三百五十包、査多空頭均係二十八家、足見兩方籌碼平衡、茲將其中貿賣額戶最鉅者、摘錄如下、（單位包）</p>
<h3>標花買方勢力雄厚</h3>
<p>紗布交易所標凖棉花、成交存賬量、截至四月九日止、四月期成交爲二十一萬六千九百擔、五月期二十萬零七千三百擔、六月期十八萬二千三百擔、七月期十六萬八千八百擔、八月期十二萬九千二百擔、總計九十萬零四千五百擔、多空兩存賬軋過凈存數爲三十一萬一千七百擔、查賣方三十一家、買方三十家、茲將其中買賣額最大者、摘錄如下、（單位擔）</p>
<p>三品紗花均堅昂</p>
<p>十三日大孤電、三品期紗漲六角至一元一角、近月爲一百九十六元七角、遠月爲一百九十八元一角、期棉漲一角至二角、近月爲六十三元六角五分、遠月爲六十一元七角、</p>
<h3>糖市　興化白有轉鬆望</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平疲、交易仍少、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二元、轉口貨六元九角半、東赤白現貨及轉口貨俱叫原價、本廠綿白如振記。大華。金心等均無更動、成交有限、而國產興化大貢白產價有轉鬆之訊、若去胃長此不盛、後市恐有回小可能、潮靑呆定、行號俱乏進出、僅開出枝洋白一批、計七十餘包、價爲十三元六角、</p>
<p>糖業合作公司昨屆標兌之期、計總定額爲五千一百四十七包、而成交數共僅四百五十包、標價無變動、亦屬平疲之局、其售出五羊組白有順由廠出品四百四十包、二十一元八角半、曲溪廠出品僅十包、二十一元六角半、餘如二號四號綿白及中砂白俱原價、無成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　汕橘餅產價又漲</h3>
<p>汕頭橋餅、前以到存兩缺、斷檔以來、已逾匝月、茲據產區消息、現在該處存貨仍少、辦價不以申銷不振而疲、比前反漲二元半之多、某號已稍有辦入、不日即可運申、成本旣增、開價勢必隨升、故近日雖値溫州厦門貨疲跌之際、而汕貨獨以稀缺轉漲也、</p>
<h3>五金　大廣皮客銷驟動</h3>
<p>三尺六尺大廣皮、近日客帮銷場突然發動、而本街同行拆貨亦甚衆多、故市况頗為繁盛、行情亦十分堅挺、每擔沽九元、比前加高二角半、單購俏擋花色者、需價九元五角云、惟二尺六尺之小廣皮、走勢則不若大廣皮之活潑、故行情反比前軟弱、每擔售九元進關、現欵交易及大批買賣、價僅開八元七角半云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東貨呢絨續有訂定</h3>
<p>東貨呢絨、日來呢絨店與洋服舖、續有訂定、如中厚嗶嘰。薄花呢·板絲呢·冲司泡鐵克四·派力斯·黃斜紋·白吉布·白嗶嘰·白直貢·等是也、一般較小行家營業均盛、定價均以國幣計算、上海碼頭交貨、的三星期後可到、聞日來各中日商行、續有相當到貨、預料今日開關、報關出貨及郵局提貨者、必甚擁擠也、</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<h3>（方正）</h3>
<p>冬靑雖沒有桃李那未鮮艷動人，但是冬靑經過了幾個春秋，是不變本色的，而桃李却不行呀！這裏似乎表徵着做人不要驕傲，因爲驕傲只能曇花一現，却不能永世不朽！</p>
<p>當橄欖進口咀嚼的時候，覺得十分澀苦，但是隔了幾分鐘後，却漸漸的發甜而淸香了。這便是我們做人最好的模範。</p>
<p>弗蘭克令曾經說：「井涸而後知水之可貴。」我以爲這話拿來勉勵職業界的靑年，那是最合適也沒有了，因爲現在職業界中的靑年，往往在不滿現在的地位，甚至還會怨天允人，若是一旦給他們失業了，又會回憶着從前在業的時候了。</p>
<p>「難之一字，惟愚入所用之字典有之。」這是拿破崙鼓勵人們的，我想靑年們，更値得拿來自勉一番。</p>
<h3>記七十兒郎九十翁</h3>
<p>— 梅可容</p>
<p>彭祖八百，顏回三六，壽夭各異，昔人以爲壽夭系於天數，今則以攝生爲歸，惟天數之說，似屬渺茫，攝生之論，較爲實際，人苟善攝厥躬，彌不康壽，反之必致天促，攝生之道，以正心寬心爲主，科學上所謂精神之攝護，肌肉决之，證之吾邑七十兒郞九十翁事，可見一斑矣。松江葉榭鎭，爲黃浦江邊一鎮，舟久內地，必經是隘，人烟稠密，當甲子齊盧釁起，兩軍隔江相守，爭持多日，報上頗多記載，不亞一二八役之廟行兩字；卽松鹽總廠及稽核支所，亦設於是，滬人食鹽，庶給於彼，故江浙人氏，彌不知有此鈸。鎭有天德堂藥店，店主沈姓，名玉如，上月杪爲其九十壽誕，按人年九秩，已爲難得，共可記者允在四代同堂，綠老翁之子蔚靑，今年適爲七十齡，蔚靑長子國鈞年四十九歲，决子秉鈞三十八，幼子奎鈞亦三十許矣。國鈞早世，遺一女，名菊華，二十餘歲，秉鈞子增壽及景荃，均十餘齡，祖孫四代，同居共炊，怡怡如也。九十老翁，體氣强盛，目下一店事務，尙由其獨自掌理，洒掃諸事，不肯假手於人，步行不用人扶，其攝生之法，早起早眠，不進烟酒，飲食有節，允以自三十歲斷絃之後，未曾一近女色，克享遐齡，其在斯歟？七十之子，頗熱心社會事業，修橋補路，扶孤恤寡，每先於人，地方人士頗有不能少此君之槪。其語人謂：我沈氏以不賒欠爲家訓，緣欠人而不還，中心譴責，欠人欲還而不能還，內心焦急，刺激彌甚，故年終歲底、從未有揭單欠票送達。至其藹然熊度，如對春風，其孫秉鈞奎鈞二人，爲人亢爽，不後於父祖，曾孫增壽等，現均在求學時代，前日爲老翁誕辰，闔鎭人士，以爲際茲人心漓薄，平時耗精勞神，訐論得失，恒若顏子之短，今祖孫四代一堂，殊不多覯，乃羣相往賀。酒宴旣開，俗有敬酒之舉，初七十老翁對客謂舉家嚴命代敬杯酒，繼之以秉鈞，末殿以增壽，景荃，連來三代家嚴之命，在座賓朋，爲之羨贊，而蕞爾一鎭，生此人瑞，誠若該鎭公安局長宗毓麟賀聯所謂「一門瑞氣千門頌，七秩兒郞九秩翁」也。蔚靑平日承歡膝下，雖鬚髮皓然，猶作童態以悅親，殊與古之戲綵萊子，今古相映焉。</p>
<h3>談筍</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>春季薦筍，見於宋史，春筍俗名毛筍，當此三四月間，艥艥穿苔，香苞嫩籜，食之最爲淸雋。嘗見六硏齋筆記，載有採筍法曰：「日出後就土取之，投密竹器中，勿見風，風觸則本堅，浸水則肉硬，脫殼煮則失味，生着刃則失柔，采而停久非鮮也，盛而苦風非藏也，脫殼非治也，凈之入水非洗也，蒸煮不久非熟也，知此可與語食筍矣。」</p>
<p>筍可和肉煮，他如油燜筍，炒蝦子筍，亦饒至味，據云：「竹最忌芝蔴，一沾蔴油，或其渣滓，立卽萎敗，故筍雖老硬，得蔴油則酥軟可口，」老饕家不可不知。</p>
<p>虎爪尖，產杭州，龔定盦詩：「有筍名曰虎爪尖。」松江佘山產筍有蘭香，毛筍之一，須初出土時，卽掘取煮食，吾則質老味遜，淸高宗南巡，錫佘山爲蘭筍山。但運至他處，隔宿卽失香氣。故閒情偶寄有云：「筍之一物，斷斷宜在山林，城市所產者，任爾芳鮮，終是筍之剩義，此蔬食中之第一品也。肥羊嫩豕，何足比肩，但將筍肉齊烹，合盛一簋，人止食筍而遺肉，則肉爲魚，而筍爲熊掌可知矣。購於市者且然，况山中之旋掘者乎。」</p>
<p>許口北嘗許啖徐文長以筍，文長詩以戲之云：「口北淸饞似大蘇，窮邊那得筍燒壚，曾聞止渴消梅子，故寫龍孫興大夫。」殊饒風趣也。</p>
<h3>星社春禊追記</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>星社之集，迄今已十五年，社友三十餘，而半客海上，因於淸明日春禊於冠生園農塲，如期而至者十四人，與夫人偕者碧波，冷月，挈公子者紅蕉，所謂裙展翩至，少長咸集。</p>
<p>園主人洗冠生君，於臨行各贈糖果，而吳吉人君復以金魚餉冷月夫婦曁江公子，一則將以易畫，一則喜其婉變也。</p>
<p>余與洗君各出小冊索與集者題字，惟冷月最賣力，於梅余眞畫冊，題元人詩一絕。於洗册畫紅黑金魚各一尾，蓋其畫興甚豪，携筆墨來，爲時過促，市遠又不得素紙，似尙未盡其淋漓之致耳。</p>

<p>你必定說，不許他在別地方沾來的嗎？也不一定是今天。這是你應當問的。可是他如果早沾上了，今天他不穿這件衣服來赴的了，正因爲是出門以後沾染的，來不及回去換。而且他那鞋底上，沾有一點水泥，這也是郵局門口新修地面之物。旣沾泥又染漆，他必到郵局無疑。一封信，直到他於赴的之前，親送到郵局，决不是平常信。我不由得連連鼓了兩下掌說：越猜越妙，無論對與不對，但是你說得頭頭是道，也就讓我心服口服了。他見我聽得入神，手裏掄着那枝秋葉，臉上一笑，似乎叉更進一步的猜出了什麽。我便笑問者說：你還有行麽妙論呢？他還不會答復，蘭厂已是老遠的招着手說：大家都餓了，請來用飯罷。當時我們隨了主人的招待入席，暫時停止了這個問題。酒醉飯飽以後，蘭厂把我邀到小園的一個轉角所在，讓進一間小屋子去。這屋子外而，栽着兩株芭蕉，一架紫藤，地點是幽靜極了。白粉墻的矮星，有兩扇黑漆的門。我早就覺得這地方足可清談。這屋子裏沒有什麼陳設，只是籐椅藤几，高架上供着兩盆常綠草，矮几上，養一瓷缸金魚，一排兩個窗子，全半垂疏簾。我首先笑着說：這地方很幽雅，可以請那位阮先生來談談了。蘭厂說：他沒有終席，就走了。我聽了這話，不由得臉上一紅，便笑問着說：他是不屑於請託我了。繭厂搖着手說：你不要誤會。他把應該供給你的村料，都留下來了。說着，他就把脇下夾的一個花布包，放到正中的藤几上，指着說：都在這裏面了。我說：他爲什麽不見我呢？蘭厂說：他和我認識，前後快到一年，也只到這裏三次，其間通過兩封信。他並不住在蘇州，今午是坐火車來的，他又趕着上火車站了。他對我說：看你的樣子，足可以付託的，就請我把這包東西轉交給你。他又說：這些東西，他還是要的，請你保留着。將來他會和你通信。剛才我不是離席了一回嗎一？就是同他說話。他說過話之後，立刻吿辭，我想通知你一聲都來不及。他是一位女太太，我又不便强留，只好由他自去。我說：這位太太，眞是神龍見首不見尾了。莫非他和書中事有關？蘭厂讓我對面夾了藤几坐下，隨着家人送上茶來。（八）</p>

<h3>荆沙一瞥</h3>
<p>— 王燦芝</p>
<p>荊州據長江之上游，為川楚之門戶，乃三國時蜀吳互爭之地，載諸史籍，班班可考，因其僻處遐方，故國人久已忽之。客冬外子調任適茲土，余亦隨宦衙齋，得一游覽焉。當我儕赴任之日，正行營遷往宜昌之時，僅有英商之湘和輪及日商之丹陽輪，往來於漢口沙市之問，後决定乘湘和而往。不料大餐間皆爲捷足者先得，惟我儕行期已定，不能逗留，祗得包定官艙二間，其中骯髒喧譁，不可終日，茶房祇知需索酒資，而不願意招待乘客。厠所位於下層，門前置數統艙乘客之舖位，其臭不可嚮邇。茶房爭相位置私人乘客之舖位，以致互相口角，繼以用武，頓使乘客受驚，不知所措。外人視國人如猪狗，以簡陋之官艙處中國人，以富麗之大餐間處外國人，界限嚴明。官艙乘客，不能展其足至大餐間。國人不知自愛，非特不改其惡習，且變本加厲，不啻自認爲猪狗，而增其輕侮之心，恥孰甚焉！</p>
<p>第三日傍晚，輪抵沙市，外子與歡迎者相周旋，余即登陸，下榻於大華旅館，聞爲該地旅館中之巨擘。則見墻壁之間，水痕斑剝，戶牖欹斜，已表現出其經過一番水災浩刧矣。我儕已用晚膳於輪中，到後歡迎奢爲設接風之宴，不及推辭，祇得入席。外子與男賓一席，余與二女賓一席，皆因晚餐未久，飽不思食，余偶憶「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」之句，更爲之憮然不能下嚥焉！</p>
<p>所居之窒，窗臨狹巷，對面爲一眼鏡玉器店，門前有一賣炊餅之婦人，衣裳垢汚，作餅之餘，輒以雙手撫摸其破污之鞋，少時叉授餅與人，觀之令人作三日嘔。至更深夜闌，餅猶未罄，露冷風寒，爲之愁急不置。翌日晨興，復立窗前小眺，巷中賣菜及賣食物奢　集，皆衣衫襤褸，齷齪不堪，不知新生活運動者亦見之吾？晨餐後，即赴衙著接事，乘汽車而往。除沙市有馬路數處外，餘皆爲高低不平之爛泥路，行車旣感困難，又覺危險。行至中途，見有警察二名押二鄉人，身負牌示而行，聞爲違反新生活者，故游街以昭炯戒。入城後，經一狹街，乃江陵最繁盛之街云。車行其中，幾無餘道，可以行人。少焉，行抵衙署，屋宇軒敞，惟破舊不堪，入其窒中，霉氣襲人，令人不耐。年來建設之聲，甚囂塵上，行政機關尙復如此，其何以壯觀瞻耶？</p>
<p>該地敎育幼稚，風氣閉塞，海上婦運家，以謀婦女解放自由平等爲職志，鄙意以爲上海婦女，已得歐風之沾染，自趨解放之途，如能深人內地，功德豈淺尠哉！</p>

<h3>我的病</h3>
<p>— 星叔</p>
<p>民國十五年之夏，距今十個年頭了，海上霍亂流行，朝病夕死，人心惶惑。那時我在一個時疫醫院担任醫生。科學醫自然是我所信仰的，惟其信仰，不免懐疑：懐疑與頑固不同，懐疑是科學家的態度，懐疑之後，也許信仰更力堅定。雖然那時醫院裏上上下下四五十人，都爲了预防傳染霍亂起見，無不遵守院長命令，注射三次預防霍亂免疫疫苗，我却有點懐疑這預防的方法，毅然拒絕，不受注射，一句話梗在骨頭裏，看看我究竟會不會傳染。事實最是雄辯，三個月之內，一院之中，偏偏獨一無二，祇有我一個人傳染霍亂，上吐下瀉，螺癟脚吊，……症象是雹亂，大便細菌檢査是霍亂，鐵證如山，霍亂坐實了，病勢危殆，幾乎一病不起，幸而趕緊施行鹽水注射，以及種種合法的處置，把我從鬼門關抓回，沒有見到閣王。「乖乖弄的東」，好不危險，「懐疑」，「科學家的態度」，差一點白送性命一條。從茲，對於霍亂預防注射的功力，不敢小視，信仰更加堅强了。</p>
<p>霍亂預防注射的功效，早由學者證明無訛，我也老早洞悉，所以不惜冒險以身嘗試者，這呌做「自我試騐」。「自我試騐」，醫界先哲，不少的人這樣做法，爲闡明事實，寗願犧牲自己的健康，甚至犧牲生命，要脚踏實地做他一番；在我們貴國人士，看來覺得眞是太愚太痴了，須知世界文明，學術進步，乖子是一點貢獻都沒有的。</p>
<p>依我的體騐及臨證方面的觀察，霍亂預防注射，效力確實，毫無疑議。流光如駛，轉瞬春去夏來，霍亂流行時季又到，奉勸諸公，切勿懐疑，穩妥爲第一，如其怕傳染霍亂，請你到醫生那邊去，注射三决防疫針，保你可以平平安安的過一個夏天。</p>
<p>三年之前，有一個時期，我爲了一件事情（與名利女人無關），大患失眠症，這是神經興奮太甚的原因。閱世不深，涵養不足，讀書不多，見理不明，又是使神經容易戟刺的原因。記得那時，輾轉床側，目不交睫，思慮叢生，苦悶之極。自己是個醫生，當然安眠藥樣樣吃到，可是並無甚特別的功效，後來還是自己大澈大悟，把事理看個明白，算了罷，丢開心頭，奇怪得很，一個多月的失眠，竟不藥而愈，能够一覺睡到大天光了，一直到現在還是這樣。關於我失眠的話，在「眠不得」那篇文字裏說得不少，在此不欲重說，免得取厭讀者。總而言之，如其失眠不是因病痛所致成，而係神經性的失眠，是可以用自己心理作用去醫治，藥力是眞眞有限。我一個人說的話，或許諸公不能十分相信吧，現在摘錄一位龍毓瑩醫生的文字以供諸公參閱，龍醫生生肺病，睡在醫院裏療養，得了失眠症，他的治法是怎樣，請看下文：「　在湘雅醫院整整睡了半年，那時最苦的就是兩件事，第一件是晚上睡不着，着急怕加病。誰知愈着急愈睡不着，常常睜眼看了天亮。……每决睡不着，就吃安眠藥，所有安眠藥用盡了，睡不着還是睡不着。有幾决吃嗎啡，分量很重，吃得四肢不能抬，眼皮撑不開；但是心裏還是明明白白，什麽人在房裏，什麼人在走路，我都淸楚，還是睡不着，那就眞束手無策了；於是心裏一橫，睡不着我偏不急，今晚不睡，明日可睡，明日不睡，明晚可睡。……自從定了這個主張之後，每天晚上不費吹灰之力，自然而然的入了很憇蜜的夢境。由此可知失眠十有九是由於精神作用；如果精神方面得不着相當的安慰，隨你什麼安眠藥是沒有用的，這是我個人的經騐。如果有失眠症的人，無妨照我的方法去試辦一政上？……龍醫生的主張，不期與敝人見解一樣「英雄所見，大略相同。」其斯之謂歟？</p>
<p>我又生過一决瘧疾，發着的時期，寒熱交作，令人有世態炎凉的感想，好不難受。上來我就用了適當分量的金鷄納霜，依着法定的時間，內服了好多天，一舉廓淸，永不再發。現在很有許多人自作聰明，知道瘧疾發着，內服金鷄納霜，但用量及時問都不能依法辦理，藥吃下去不靈，或者再發，却埋怨金鷄納霜沒有功用，眞是寃哉枉也。現在瘧疾雖然在一部份的地方還非常流行，爲害農村，减少生產，但救濟的責任，責在衛生官廳；我不願多所發表意見，重勞手民，爲災棗梨了。</p>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（五）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>黑五人患結核之情形必須用各種不同之觀察，如在阿非利加洲之老家中，或在領土，或離菲而往他處生活等，由Keines氏之觀察，發現東阿非利加洲居民絕無結核症，又確實蹬明土著居民之被結核傳染，多不在幼年時代，乃在成年以後，而允以離其故鄉，如往海濱或城市間工作者，始能傳染及之。</p>
<p>在一百零三個成人及五十一個幼孩，用必而開氏反應Pirquet之試騐，發現成人有十個陽性反應，在幼孩中僅有一個陽性反應而已，黑人之結核症，初無久長之潛伏期，而其治愈，多因豐富之營養，及歸回故鄉之後，故結核之傳布，在菲洲之內部，初無絕大之危險，在法國屬地之黑人，因其習慣，隨地吐痰，故傳染例非常之廣。傳染之來源，大多由於歐洲兵士及其居民居住及營養之不良所致，結核之傳布，在各個屬地，亦自不同，幼童在十五歲以下，大的有六至五十%被傳染者，成人之疾病經過，的與白人無異，大的有七，八至二五%被傳染者，又在鐵道交通便利之處，的有五〇至七〇%被傳染者。允以菲洲之西部，傳染甚廣。蘇旦及撒哈拉之氣侯，似有防遏結核發展之傾向，此地之白人及混合血液者，較之黑人，對於結核允有高度傳染之可能，以是而言，則種旅的結核傳染，甚難一槪而論矣。</p>
<p>在最近百年內，大多數之黑人，均向美洲移居，而成爲斯克拉文之一族。在北美合衆購，以Qpie氏之計，為每一萬居騰中，自人有七，二死亡例，有色人為二三，三死亡例，較之白人為多出三情。以氏之楓　而　，則有　族　敏性，當然亦有其他如公共衛生等種　之　係。且在幼孩時代，多不易傳染結穢，但在十五歲至二十歲以後，其傳染較多，換言之，黑人較之白人爲反比例者，即黑人在成年以後，較白人爲易傳染，在幼年時代則反是。又疾病之經過，白人奧黑人亦絕不相同，如白人多爲　性慢性而達入瘢痕形成者，在黑人則否，多爲急性而不良者。</p>
<p>在地屈羅城，由Chadwick氏之統計，自一九二三年至一九三二年，發現黑人結核之增加，如一九〇七年白人與黑人之死亡比例爲七，〇興十三，七%，但以後白人之死亡例逐漸减少，而黑人之死亡例反行增加，在一九三二年爲六，一興二，八%之比例，死亡例增加之原因，當然由生活情形之不良。</p>
<p>結核關於種族感應性之問題如何，Bogen氏曾研究及之，而以爲種族之關係極大。如美洲及菲洲之黑人死亡例，較之白人爲高，在此種民族間，幼孩患結核者極少，此際對於結核發生一種抵抗能力，而不易傳染結核，若傳染得之，則多數將近死亡矣。</p>
<h3>梅毒之預防</h3>
<p>— 醫藥博士山內保著介譯</p>
<p>梅毒爲妨害人類社會伸長最惡最烈之疾病，人所盡知，其害毒所及，不獨患者自身已也，而且貽害子孫，流毒社會。凡破壊社會道德之不良分子，近來日見其多者，其根源或基於此。</p>
<p>余曾檢査百二十名之先天梅毒患者，其中有五十四名智能發育不良，二名完全爲白痴兒。又曾檢査盲啞之人，盲人百名中有三十四名，啞人百名中有二十名，屬於先天梅毒患者。凡有梅毒之父母，其所生之乳兒，數月後死亡者居多，縱偶有成長者，亦皆低能兒與畸形兒而已。</p>
<p>試追尋梅毒之促成人種民族趨於滅亡之跡，遠如菲洲，印度，近如蒙古，其梅毒侵襲力之猛烈，皆有足使吾人戰憟者。</p>
<p>余會於北滿旅行中，在札蘭屯得到「蒙古人壯丁之徵發檢査，百人中有六十人爲梅毒患者。」之報吿。</p>
<p>日本國內，此惡疾之爲害亦烈，茲舉二三例爲證。</p>
<p>余所經營之診療所，徵其過去十年間之統計，一萬三千人之患者中，有梅毒感染之旣往症者，實達六〇%之多。在余之診療所就醫者，多屬知識階級，尙且如此，此外因其職業，因共環境之關係，其梅毒威染率卽說有一〇〇%之高，非過言也，足見梅毒侵襲力之猛烈，屬於超自然的。</p>
<p>國家雖依各種法律，或用其他手段，以防止梅毒之蔓延，但共效果實等於零，世人日處滅亡慘狀之中而不自覺，此余所以不能不以積極的與根本的之梅毒預防注射法，挽救人類脫離此慘禍也</p>
<p>梅毒預防注射法，所用之藥劑，爲一種金屬，此金屬具有增强酸化作用之性能，注射之後，可使其沉着於身體組織內，藉其酸化作用，以撲滅將侵入組織內之病原體，且可使已寄生在體內之病原體歸於消滅。此卽一種之合金法也。根據此理想而施之預防法，同時亦爲治療法。</p>
<p>蒼鉛毒性微弱，而其增强酸化之作用則甚顯著，蒼鉛鹽類若注入體內，卽在組織內還元，成爲微細之顆粒狀蒼鉛，分布沉着於全身之組織內。有時具有特異性體質之患者，於注射十數時間之後，全身卽發現顆粒狀之皮疹，癢不可</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>當，是卽蒼鉛急速分布沉着於全身組織之明證。其濃淡之度，雖依組織，及患者之體質而異，但注射後三，四日，未有不達於最高點者。以後雖漸决由尿中排泄而出，然其沉着體內增强酸化之功用，至少有保存數個月之可能。凡具有特異性體質之人，注射後六個月間，尙有發癢性皮疹之存在，卽其明證也。</p>
<p>E.Sonnenberg氏，嘗於波蘭，洛慈地方，對於賣笑婦每週注射〇·一公分之蒼鉛，一年間預防梅毒感染，完全成功。又列巴集提氏，曾於法國派斯鐵爾硏究所，對於體重一公斤之動物，用〇·〇三公分之蒼鉛注射，得於六個月間，完全預防梅毒。</p>
<p>上記兩氏之業績，可稱優秀。雖然，當實際的應用之時，尙有幾多應加考慮之點。譬如賣笑婦等之有職業者，若施以長日月之注射治療，不無困難之處，一次必須注入多量之蒼鉛，務於短期間之內，將必要量之蒼鉛注射完畢。據多年之經騐，大體可依下列方式行蒼鉛之注射，向未遇見有何可虞之副作用。（蒼鉛劑用卡司畢斯「拜耳」）　　蒼鉛之梅毒預防，其必要之注射總量，凡體重一公斤者，應用蒼鉛○·○三公分以上，其預防期間爲六個月。對於患者之體質，症狀，環境等，均須一一加以考慮，規定一次之注射量爲蒼鉛〇·五公分以下爲最適當。</p>
<p>體重一公斤之注射總量，蒼鉛超過〇·〇三公分時，尙可延長預防之期間，亦並不生何等之副作用。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第三六問）　齒石應該怎樣除去？</p>
<p>答　齒石是很硬如石的薄片，緊附牙齒，用牙刷是刷不去的在不注意口腔淸潔的人，固然是鱗鱗斑斑滿口都是，就是動於刷牙的人，牙縫邊和牙齒裏側，也常附着這汚色的齒石。除去的方法，惟有請牙醫生施行手術洗牙，牙醫生有特製的儀器，能够把齒石汚物，完全刮凈，恢復牙齒潔白的美色。在洗牙時候，又可檢査出牙齒的毛病，譬方有初起的蛀洞，就可及時補好，免得日久患深。所以手術洗牙，費少益多；歐美人士，大都每半年洗牙一决；國人現亦漸知牠的利益，請醫生洗牙的日見衆多，確是牙患预防上的一好現象。</p>
<p>（第一三七問）　手術洗牙，刮去齒石，會使牙齒受傷嗎？</p>
<p>答　這個問題，我是常常聽得病家提起的，恐怕社會上人士，懐着這個疑問的也不少。其實，牙磁决不會因洗牙受傷。前面已經說過，牙磁是很硬的，極耐磨擦，牠像磁盆上的一層琺瑯質一樣，雖然經不起敲擊，但是不怕刮；不信？爾不妨用小刀在磁器上試騐一下。倘若洗牙會損傷牙齒，牠决不能在科學的牙醫術上，占一顯要地位</p>
<p>第四節　食物的選擇</p>
<p>（第一三八問）飲食和牙患有什麼關係？</p>
<p>答　不適宜的飲食，再加以惡劣的生活，會使牙齒不健全，憑你怎樣注意衛生，牙齒也易蛀壤；若是飲食優良，牙齒的抵抗力就能增加，堅固耐用。在外國地方屢决試騐和調査的結果，證明飲食能左右我們牙齒的健全。牠們把一個學校裏的兒童，給以合理的飲食，統計起來，全體的學童，很小蛀牙發生。又據美國卜氏牙醫生的經騐，在麥薩舅塞資工業區中，見那裏貧苦工人的兒童，因爲飲食的不良，缺乏滋養料滿口乳牙，多蛀蝕化膿，往往祇剩牙脚，和其他富庶城區的兒童比較，優劣相差很遠。所以飲食問題，成爲現代齒科預防學上，最有興味的研究</p>

<p>疥有蟲。奇癢。允以在被中溫暖時爲甚。東搔西擦。坐臥不安。疥之發作期。在春暖時。由於傳染者居多。蔓延極速。數日不治。已遍及全體。漸至延及全家。治療誠不容緩矣。疥非難治之症。特治療錯誤。往往經久不治。延至三數年不等。故俗有三年瘡之一言。極言其淹纏也。所謂疥蟲。多在皮下層。築有隧道。所經之處。小水泡小黑點即隨之發生。故疥藥非直透隧道。將其棲止之所。根本剷除不爲功。患疥之人。多中下級社會。經濟力有限。故疥藥不宜高昂。然市上舶來品有售至三四元者。每致令人望洋興歎。現上海法租界西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社出品之『甘露』藥水。每瓶祇售洋一元。殺菌力極强。無論疥癬濕疹癩瘡。祇需一滴。已能止癢殺蟲。未及一瓶。病已全愈。功效之神速。有如是者。價又遠不及舶來品之昂貴。誠病家之福音也。</p>
<h3>關於面麗之實騐報告　滿面面皰—消滅無形</h3>
<p>面皰不過是一種皮膚小疾。於人的身體上。本沒有甚麼大的妨碍。可是一個人的面貌。是何等璽要。對外的觀瞻。交接的塲所。禮貌兩字。是同時並重的。而且面皰常常要連續發生着多年。加之不時的痛癢。這是使人何等難堪。作者在去年。就發生了面皰。頓上鼻問額際。滿面到處發生。有說是山於血熱。有說是發育時所應有。但終沒有方法能把他除去。最近聽一個朋友說。他曾用上海同仁西藥社「面麗」。把面皰完全治好了。於是我也去買了一瓶試試。在搽了一星期後。竞出我意外的把這些面皰消滅得無形無蹤了。費了一瓶雪花粉的代價。而得此靈騐無比的藥品。眞是値得而足以稱揚。我知患面皰者十有七八。爰書我的實騐。以貢獻於大衆。（屯溪田南屏來稿）</p>
<h3>痛經與白帶</h3>
<p>— （雪心）</p>
<p>月經爲生理的機轉。難無須特別處置。但多兼有月經痛。且易因不攝生。而誘起諸種疾病。故在月經期中。非謹守衛生。以圖保守健康不可。月經來時。尤須淸潔陰部。因月經血附着於外陰部。及股間易政腐敗。不僅該部易生炎症。且誘發子宮陰道之炎症。在月經期中。每日二三次。以微溫開水。淸洗外陰部。月經帶宜每日更換。須用柔軟之紗布及棉花。月經中宜避沐浴。身體及精神須特別安靜。一切運動及精神過勞。均須避免。經中行房。爲害允大。以上諸法。離屢芻淺。然亦不得不注意也。痛經爲體弱女子所常有之疾病。其痛苦亦特甚。治法。可服上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售之「好力朋」藥片。效騐特靈。爲其他一般痛經劑所莫及。價每瓶二元。至於白帶一症。婦女患者更多。除習見之單純性白帶外。尙有混淋菌白帶。此症與痛經症。若不治療。同爲生育上絕大障碍。治療白帶。可同時服用「內服白帶丸」及「外用白帶藥」。上兩種藥。亦爲上海同仁西藥社獨家經售。價每種各二元。凡照法服用。無不隱疾悉除。如體虛白帶。小便疾痛。膣部瘙癢。白帶淋漓。濕熱下注。不便頻數。更有迅速之功效。凡上所述。皆婦女界切身之通病。與治療良藥也。其幸勿漠視斯文。</p>

<h3>關於面麗之實騐報告　治愈雀斑—締結良緣</h3>
<p>「面麗」能治雀斑與面皰。夫盡人而知之矣。乃有因「面麗」而得成眷屬者。則誠意外之佳話也。此蓋爲余表妹馬女士事。余知之詳。爰爲之記。表妹其亦怪我多事乎。馬女士。肄業本市某女中。年才十八。聰慧秀麗。小姑居處尙無郞也。女士平素愛好修飾。惟所美中不足者。面部鼻頰問。生許多雀斑耳。余會喜之曰。好一塊美玉。可惜稍沾瑕疵。伊遂引爲奇恥大辱。然百計求治而未獲良效。女士有異性友劉君。藝術家也。兩人切磋啄磨。視爲益友。初未嘗稍涉兒女之情。劉君知女士恨所患雀斑之深。遂亦多方留意。偶聞其友談及「面麗」之驚人功效。不覺心喜。因即購得兩瓶。持贈女士。女士得之如獲至寳。果搽未一月。斑點盡除。且面部較前允見嬌嫩。因此一事。女士對於其好友劉君。遂有進一步心許。今年淸明前數日。彼倆且微得家長之同意。在報紙上已見彼等之訂婚啓事矣。良緣速成。得非「面麗」爲之媒介乎。（本市張馨遠來稿）</p>
<h3>胃痛實騐靈藥</h3>
<p>— （彭德秦斌來稿）</p>
<p>暴飲飽食。頗易傷胃。小焉者。引起消化不良。及噯氣胃呆等。若歷久不治。則胃部每起劇烈之疼痛。進以蘇打諸劑。雖可解圍於一時。然稍假時日。無有不起反覆者。吾中華仕女。少事運動。飲食無節制。故息胃病者。大有其人。西子捧心。無非胃痛。常人不明醫理。有稱胃痛爲心痛者。實誤之又誤也。方今之世。靈藥蠭起。若「胃必靈」者。卽靈藥之一也。是項胃藥。服之不但痛苦若失。而能永不再發。此乃百試不爽。屢服屢效者也。</p>
<p>內戚劉。患胃痛已久。諸藥罔效。後服『胃必靈」一盒。宿疾頓愈。「胃必靈」每盒僅售一元。發售處上海法租界西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社。不佞以普天之下。其患胃痛如敝戚者。不知凡幾。若早日進以靈藥。則少受痛苦實多。故不辭文墨之簡陋。爰爲患斯病者。作一指津也。</p>

<h3>編餘閒話</h3>
<p>— （編者）</p>
<p>近來接到讀者關於「面麗」實騐後報告的信件不下數十起。或述治雀斑有效。或述治面皰奇騐。或者贊美其嫩肌潤膚之功。衆口一辭。可謂良藥之功不沒。不過本刋每期的篇幅有限。只好容俟絡續刊佈。以後如有關於各種新藥的實騐報吿。仍希讀者源源賜寄。加惠大衆。實爲不淺。</p>
<p>「甘露藥水」確爲吾人理想中的皮膚特效藥。其享名之盛。簡實有遐邇馳名。婦孺皆知之概。不論是多年的老癬。新起的疥瘡。以及一切的皮膚濕氣瘙癢。無不一滴卽靈。該藥在醫藥界地位。厥功亦爲不可沒者。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>東北血淚錄</h3>
<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>「三戶可以亡秦」，是中國歷史上最有精彩的啓示。若干悲觀的失望論者，對於目前中國的前途，不是說「中國不亡，直無天理」，便說中國實是一個無救的國家。這話拿來看殷汝耕一類的中國人，是很確當的。中國若要靠這一類人來救國，結果那眞是「中國不亡，直無天理」，別無話說。但中國人究竟不盡是殷汝耕。殷汝耕一類人只是很少數。中國還有不少不少的楊阿毛（滬戰中殉國之汽車夫）。總言之，中國人究竟不盡是「猪玀」，有知覺，有靈性，痛苦落到他們身上，本能地知道要排除這痛苦。中國很多很多的楊阿毛，生來就有負責排除痛苦的命運與本性。這本性現在還被鬱在牆角裏，箱子裏，要用隨時可用。故在他們看來，和悲觀的失望論者正相反，中國决不會亡，他們身上所負着的種種痛苦，總有被排除的一天。</p>
<p>這話可以拿來講到東北的義勇軍。東北義勇軍這名字，從民國二十年的九一八以來，繼續存在了已有五年之久。最初，這名字十分熟閙於關內人之口上。捐欵啦，慰勞啦，以至專講東北義勇軍的文章與書籍，一篇篇，一本本，和關內人口頭上特別熱心於束北義勇軍這名字相應，一批批湧着在書攤上出現，賺了不少讀者的義憤與眼淚，也賺了不少讀者的錢。但從此以後，東北義勇軍這名字，在關內人口頭上，漸漸的被冷落了，最後被消滅了。專講東北義勇軍的書籍與文章，再也不能在書攤上在雜誌中發現。報紙中再也不見關於義勇軍的長篇通訊，偶有關於義勇軍的片段消息，再也引不起人家注意。但束北義勇軍，還只是一聲不響地，埋頭在氷天雪地，飢寒交迫之中，和敵人作更艱苦的抗戰。他們還只是知道只有這樣才是他們唯一求生的出路。</p>
<p>據最近報吿，東北義勇軍還有五十萬人。另一個消息，東北某小學，因秘密紙織救國團體，事洩被捕殺者若干人。又息，日僞軍在長春招募補充軍隊，但愛國靑年，多不應招，故人數極少。又一條消息，長春有一女郞，馳驅疆塲，爲國捐軀。類此片段記載，眞是錄不勝錄。無論關內入對於這些血涙斑斑的奮鬥史置若無睹，東北義勇軍的艱苦抗戰，始終持續着，發展着。吿訴我們，除鄭孝胥，趙欣伯等外，東北還有廣大的楊阿毛一類人存在着哪！</p>
<h3>燕</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>這情形，與其說我們是到學堂里去讀，我想不如說是去聽談天來得確切些；因爲我們那位先生講故事要比敎書高興而有精神得多。自然，這在我們那是求之不得的啊—</p>
<p>那年的春天，學堂里的二樑上忽然有一對燕子來組織了一個新的小家庭，從此，我們除了玩樂，聽故事之外，就是看牠們一對飛去，又一對飛來，在室里飛繞鳴呌着：牠們眞像一對新婚的夫婦，影形不離的度着甜蜜的歲月。</p>
<p>但這樣的過了些日子，不復再看見牠們一對的同出同進了；時常只見一隻出去，而另一隻却躱在巢里守着。那一隻出去的不久也回來了，於是躱在巢里的那頭也快活的呌嗓着，似乎大家又是一番熱烈慰勞與訴說。又隔了的莫半個月光景吧—那一對小東西忽然和以前一樣地飛出飛進了，但牠們出去的時間好像並不再怎樣長久，而回來時還在嘴里啣一點什麽到巢里去。</p>
<p>一天，兩天的過去，那巢邊上却發現了四隻嫩黃的尖嘴巴，每當牠們從外面飛回來時，巢里就會吱吱吱的噪嚷起來；同時，我們可以望見四隻尖嘴張得大大的，在鑽動着，現出那紫紅色的里層，十分美麗的。我們天天看牠們像母親喂自家的孩子似的喂着，牠們更懂事的撫育着，牠們啣了食物來給牠們吃，再替牠們將拉出來的糞汚啣到外面去；這辛苦和勞碌是與人們的父母一樣的偉大可敬的。</p>
<p>漸漸地，牠們居然也能够到巢邊上去徘徊了，並且，牠們身上全都披起了一襲美麗的靑色羽衣，菊紅色的社兜；活潑地十分好看。</p>
<p>有一天，當先生正陶醉在雲霧烟霞里，而我們也得到了絕對自由時候，大家都發起了一個奇想，——趁着老燕子不在，小癩痢首先　到天井里去掮了一根長竹竿，向樑上那麽輕鬆地挑了一下，那個牠們啣泥拾梗的建造了幾天而認爲美麗的小家庭便給毀壞了，同時四頭小乳燕也跟着跌落到了方磚地上。乳燕跌到地上之後，大家便爭搶拋着玩，沒有多少時間，那四頭可憐的小生命終於給我們送掉了。後來，等到那對老燕歸來，找不到牠們的家，更不見了牠們的孩子，就嘶聲地在簷頭，在樑間哀鳴着，悲呌着，彷彿在咒咀着人類的殘忍無道，但這時我們不但沒有同情，而且還要用竹竿驅逐着牠們；最後先生間起我們時，我們也只說給花貓吃掉了，巢也給破壞了，於是事情便這樣輕輕地掩飾了過去。</p>
<p>—這時的我們是多麽地殘酷啊！自家兒心里這樣默默地想着，但，我現在卽使願意再回到那殘酷的時代去，也不可能了。（完）</p>
<h3>木匠的兒子</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>小花兒回到家，把書包放在他爸爸用殘餘的木料做成的小桌子上，就獨自上後門河邊去了。</p>
<p>小花兒的爸是做木匠的，一早上工，要太陽落山才回家。他媽終年兩支手浸在水桶里帮人家洗衣服，這樣一個窮困的家，小花兒却有一份讀書的幸福是有原因的：去年夏天，他爸上縣立小學校去修葺房屋，小花兒常在媽分不開手來的時候，到學校去送飯。當他第一决踏進那幸福的樂園，他看着小朋友們穿着整齊的制服在操塲上學兵操，他就不想離開那里，而且他向媽討來了送飯的差使，天天在塲的一角里學着他們的兵操，有時更偸偷地在敎室的窓下聽講書。有一决散工的時候？他牽着爸的手，唱着「進，進，中國軍人…」的歌走過校長室，被校長看上了，允許他做免費生，每天來上學。</p>
<p>於是小花兒穿上了那種短袖短褲的衣服是縣立小學校的學生了。他爸爸比兒子更高興，校長在他眼里是有皇帝那樣偉大的，現在校長看上他的兒子做免費生，他想該是造屋翻身的時候了，一個木匠有一個縣立小學校里的兒子，這是光榮的歷史呵！</p>
<p>工塲上休息的時候，他嚼着廉價的烟捲向同伴訴說；「張瞎子的話沒有錯兒，他老是說我生了貴人的八字，做木匠一定有寳貝鎭厄住了。」他把寳貝兩個字音特別提高，彷彿說書先生賣關子一似的，一邊瞇着眼睛笑了起來。</p>
<p>馬頭上馬工學着他的腔，用拳頭打在自己大腿上，側着頭頸說；「哼，你知道那寳貝是什麽？就是我的乖乖一小花兒啊！」（未完）</p>

<h3>娜拉（廿一）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作圖　忻炘說明</p>
<p>娜拉換了家常衣服出來，很鎭定地說：滔佛，坐下我們好好地談一談。在這八年裏頭，你何嘗愛我？你不過覺得戀愛着我好玩罷了。在家裏，我是我的爸爸的「頑意兒的孩子，」在你這裏，我是你的「頑意兒的妻子，」我現在一無所能，都是你們害我的。</p>
<p>郝爾茂惶急地：娜拉，你說什麼？</p>
<p>娜拉：我立刻要走了—我還有對於我自己的責任，現在我要去學了，我要看看究竟是我錯了還是世界錯了</p>
<p>郝爾茂：娜拉，你病了；你說的都是害熱病的胡話</p>
<p>娜拉。我一生從來不曾有過今天晚上這樣的淸爽的日，我守了八年，今天晚上「奇事」來了，我以爲你一定會挺身而出地對他說：「你儘管發表這件事，這件事情是我做的！」可是你所做的完全不像我願意嫁的男子，後來你害怕過了—你害怕不是爲我，完全是爲自己—你又裝沒事人了。我仍舊做你的小雀兒，你的玩意兒。</p>
<p>郝爾茂：我爲你忍窮忍苦都願意，但是世界上沒有男子肯爲了他所愛的女子犧牲自己名譽的。</p>
<p>娜拉：世上整千整萬的女子都爲了男子犧牲了名譽。</p>

<p>雪中的行商</p>
<p>大雪紛飛的一個早晨；「買國貨牙粉，雪花膏罷」，「愛國的同胞買國貨牙粉雪花膏罷！」这沉着的聲音隨着冷風送進了溫暖的屋子裏，打斷了一個母親與孩子的談話，母親叫孩子去把那個叫買的人進行要向他買牙粉，在雙方的交談中，母親發現了這個買牙粉雪花膏的人還是自己的鄉親時，他們更談得來啦！</p>
<p>但是你恐怕還沒有知哩？他們不但是鄉親，吿訴你吧！他們還是一對情侶呢？你一定要奇怪，可是事情一點兒也不奇怪，原來那個母親在十年前的時候，她正是一個靑春活潑的少女，那個行商也正是一個英俊的少年呵！他們一個人是同在一個學校裏念書的，彼此都互愛着，後來她家裏爲了當不在督軍們的劇削，家裏就窮了下來，當然念書也只好停止了，由母親的作主把她嫁一個當吉林鹽務局科長的做了塡房太太；這樣子一來，當然他們二個人也就分開了，她隨了丈夫由北方遷移到南方的上海，嫁後不到一年便生了這個孩子，如今算起來已經十年多啦！</p>
<p>他呢？由於敵人的侵略，家鄉是變成職場，當然他們是不願意，束手待斃的聯合了一些同志起來抵抗敵人，給敵人整整的打了兩年，祇望關內的人，大家起夾帮助他們，接濟他們，可是在萬分困難中挨到了今年，實在無辦法中，纔和十幾個同志到南方來，雖然他是念過書的，但是聯業是多難找啊!他們祇好替一家「繼興化學工業社」做推銷員。</p>
<p>彼此山淺處而淡到深處，一切都明白了！</p>
<p>這時她發現到他從前那可愛的眼睛，又多叉靑的頭髮額上的一個紅印子，現在雖然額上的紅印子還是那樣紅，可是頭髮却白得多啦！眼角上加着大一塊傷。</p>
<p>當這時候她的丈夫——富紳突然出現在門口，丈夫看到她與一個類似叫化子的推銷員互相抱着很親熱，立刻駡她下流，一面把他——行商趕出去，當她還沒有出去的一刹那，她終於忍不住叫出口來，「二哥！我跟你走，我已經賣給他——常紳十年了，難道呌我——輩子賣給他嗎？難道叫我再受他作賤嗎？現在現在是被賣的人自己贖身的時候了‘被作賤被欺騙的摔脫他的鍊子的時候了！」行商即着說：「對啊！潤姑娘，我們已經看淸了我們的前途，在東北冰天雪地裏那些同志在等着我們呢！」他們二人說完話，互相拉着手，望雪花亂飛的曠野裏衝出去！</p>
<p>雖然富紳强拉住孩子，可是被孩子用力的摔脫了父親的手，亦跟着追出去，一面悲壯的喊着：「媽媽！馮先生！等一等帶我去，帶我到東北去，別人忘記了東北，我沒有忘祀東北啊！帶我去！」。</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng Visits Yan Xishan, Reaches Agreement on Bandit Suppression Strategies; Yesterday Flew from Taiyuan to Southern Shanxi to Inspect Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Met with Local Generals, Gave Personal Instructions on Bandit Suppression; Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, and Other Bandits Split into Groups from Jishan and Fled South; Xu Haidong, Liu Zidan’s Troops were Surrounded in Zhongyang, Engaged in Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, and other bandit main forces are now concentrated in Jingshan County. After being severely attacked by our central armies, one group of several hundred people, one group of about two thousand people, and another group of several hundred people crossed the Yellow River and fled south. Chen Cheng visited Yan Xishan yesterday, agreed on suppression strategies, and at nine o'clock this morning, accompanied by Guo Wu-wu, the director of his department, flew by Curtiss aircraft from Taiyuan to Houma Town in southern Shanxi and various bandit areas to inspect. He also met with local generals separately, giving personal instructions on bandit suppression. Many important military and political figures went to the airport to see him off. After Chen Cheng finishes his work in southern Shanxi, he will go to Xi'an for a trip. The five thousand troops of the bandit Xu Haidong and Liu Zidan were surrounded in the northern territory of Zhongyang County yesterday by the Li Shengda, Sun Chu, and Yang Xiao-ou columns, who launched a major attack. The bandits, seeing the critical situation, broke through the encirclement, advancing and retreating, pursuing and suppressing. First, they used gunfire, and finally, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The battle was extremely fierce, with six to seven hundred bandits killed. Now, a part of the bandits has fled in disarray, and our army is pursuing them. (13th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The bandits who fled south from Xing County and Lin County were fiercely pursued by Li Shengda's troops. Director Yan Xishan dispatched Fu Fang and other troops to assist in the suppression. The bandits fled south in panic to Lishi. Yan Xishan again ordered Sun Chu's troops in Zhongyang to go north to intercept them, and dispatched Yang Xiao-ou's troops from Fenyang to move west at night to cut off the escape route, in the hope of encircling them on all sides and completely annihilating them. According to a report on the 12th, the bandits fled to the city of Lishi. Because Li Chuanfang's troops and others were pressing the attack, they dared not attack the city and hurriedly fled south. At noon on the 12th, they arrived near Zhujia Village, thirty miles south of Lishi, and were suddenly attacked by Sun Chu's troops and could not withstand the attack. They then turned southeast and fled to Sanjia Village, where they encountered Yang Xiao-ou's troops blocking their way. The bandits were extremely panicked and immediately tried to break through the encirclement, charging Yang's troops six or seven times. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and the fighting was exceptionally fierce. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. On the 12th, the Pacification Headquarters received a telegram from the front, stating that the fighting was fierce on the afternoon of the 12th in the original Taoyuan, Fujia Dang, and other places north of Zhongyang City. A group that fled to Xia Zao Lin in the northwest of Zhongyang had already been surrounded by Sun's army. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and had no way to escape. Most of them gathered in the mountain gullies around Baima Cave and are currently being searched. (13th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

There is no trace of bandits on the banks of the Pudu River. Furthermore, the troops of the three columns of Guo Rudong, Li Jue, and Fan Songfu have entered Yunnan. On the 11th, the three column commanders, Guo, Li, and Fan, arrived in the province to visit Gu Zhutong and Long Yun, seeking instructions.

<p>(Nanjing) Ding Weifen reported at the Central Commemorative Week on the morning of the 13th, stating that the Chinese nation is a peaceful nation, so it is conservative rather than aggressive. However, this has accumulated bad habits of romanticism and sentimentality. Today, we must promote military training to eradicate these two bad habits, because military training is disciplined, serious, and active, so it can wash away romantic laziness. On a larger scale, it can transform the Chinese nation into an orderly, diligent, and new nation, which can save the country and ensure its survival. Party comrades, who lead the masses, should set an example in military training and lead all compatriots in this fundamental work of eradicating romantic laziness to save the country and ensure its survival. (13th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin Sen spoke on "National Economic Construction" at the National Government Commemorative Week on the morning of the 13th. He first stated that China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and rich treasures, but they cannot be fully utilized and developed. Therefore, rural areas are now bankrupt, and the people are poor and financially exhausted. The method of relief is to unite the whole country and work hard on national economic construction. He stated that in the Premier's will, in addition to many specific plans suggested in the National Construction Outline, the Premier analyzed China's economic construction into four major guidelines to teach future generations: First, make the best use of human talent; Second, develop the land's resources; Third, make the best use of materials; Fourth, facilitate the flow of goods. If these four points can be completed, then China can definitely be transformed into a wealthy and strong country. He further elaborated on the above four points based on the Premier's will, and finally encouraged the people to follow the Premier's will and strive to engage in national economic construction, so that people can make the best use of their talents, the land can be fully utilized, materials can be shared, and goods can flow freely. Only in this way can we fulfill our responsibilities. (13th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Provisional Clauses Will Be Added to the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Hancao returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<p>According to him, this decision was made after Presidents Sun Ke and Ye Chucang and Wang Chonghui exchanged opinions on the draft constitution in Shanghai and did not come to a concrete conclusion. However, according to reporters' inquiries, all parties believe that it seems necessary to add provisional clauses to the draft constitution. Because some matters stipulated in the constitution may not be implemented immediately. For example, the constitution stipulates that members of the Legislative Yuan should be elected by the people. However, when the people have not yet fully exercised their four powers, it seems easy to cause malpractices if members of the Legislative Yuan are elected by the people immediately upon the promulgation of the constitution. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate separate transitional measures in the constitution. Provisional clauses are the transitional measures necessary for the provisions of the constitution to seek harmony between ideals and reality. The German constitution has this legislative precedent. When the Legislative Yuan drafted the constitution, most members of the Legislative Yuan also had this view and tried to remedy it by other means. Therefore, it was not stipulated in the constitution. Now that all parties feel that this is necessary, the Central Constitution Review Committee should accept it and give it careful discussion.

<h3>The Difficulties of the Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Following the arrival of Doihara Kenji in China and the appointment of Matsumuro Takayoshi, the head of the Special Agency of the Japanese Garrison in North China, in Tianjin, Japanese military officers from various places in North China successively went to Tianjin for talks. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others also went to Tianjin to discuss matters with Matsumuro. The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, which had been silent for a while, suddenly became active. Now Song Zheyuan is staying in Tianjin waiting for the return of Nagami, the chief of staff of the Japanese Garrison in North China, from Japan. The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy is expected to develop concretely after Zhu Xing and Nagami meet. The long unresolved issues of the abolition of the Hebei-Eastern puppet organization, the return of the six counties in Chahar, and the recently promoted joint anti-communism between China and Japan by the Japanese side, it is hoped that they can all have a considerable outcome on this occasion.</p>
<p>As far as Hebei-Chahar diplomacy is concerned, the most important point for the Japanese side is of course joint anti-communism. This is the third item of the Hirota Three Principles. Now the Japanese side is using this point to negotiate with us. The true intention of the Japanese side in advocating joint anti-communism is that after the Japanese Garrison in North China is strengthened, it will use joint anti-communism as an excuse to extend its military power to the scope of the anti-communist zone. To put it more bluntly, it is to expand the North China war zone in disguise. The Japanese side is now proposing to set up a Sino-Japanese Joint Anti-Communist Committee and conclude a joint anti-communist agreement, while the Hebei-Chahar authorities have repeatedly stated that they have already made extremely meticulous arrangements for anti-communism and do not need to do it for them. The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy should take this as the first difficulty.</p>
<p>The issue of the abolition of the Hebei-Eastern puppet organization had already undergone many resolutions of negotiation before Doihara Kenji left China. Later, the Japanese side used the issue of Yin Rugeng's exit as an excuse, which eventually caused the negotiations to come to a standstill. It can be seen that the Japanese side has no intention of unconditionally abolishing the puppet organization. Moreover, the various illegal political activities carried out by the Hebei-Eastern puppet organization under the protection of the Japanese side are enough to reflect the Japanese side's premeditation. For example, the private establishment of inspection stations to collect customs duties and protect smuggling is to undermine our tariff system. The revision of textbooks is to eliminate the national consciousness of our Hebei-Eastern compatriots. The establishment of radio stations and the establishment of newspapers and news agencies is to carry out propaganda that is detrimental to China. The Japanese side has already created so many established facts in Hebei-Eastern. Even if the Hebei-Eastern puppet organization can be abolished, it will certainly put forward other larger exchange conditions. If we get the empty name of abolishing the Hebei-Eastern puppet organization, but in reality, it creates many new war zones in disguise and loses double the sovereignty, then we are certainly unwilling.</p>
<p>As for the issue of the return of the six counties in Chahar, since the puppet army of Li Shouxin forcibly occupied the six counties, our local authorities and the Japanese military liaison officer in Zhangjiakou, Oomoto, have had many resolutions of negotiation, but the situation has made no progress. Now it is even more involved in the anti-communist issue in Suiyuan and Chahar. The Japanese side said that for the sake of anti-communism, the puppet army in the six counties of Chahar cannot be easily withdrawn. In the future, it may even be necessary to add more. This issue is obviously related to the issue of joint anti-communism, and the solution is of course also difficult.</p>
<p>In short, in the current environment in North China, we are only using diplomatic theory to awaken the introspection of the Japanese military and to unconditionally abolish the war zone and the puppet organization, return the forcibly occupied land, and eliminate the plan to extend the military power in North China. I am afraid that it is not easy. The opening of the difficult situation in Hebei-Chahar diplomacy seems to require more efforts in many aspects other than diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Zumi Masuichi Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate; Kawagoe Will Be Promoted to Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zumi Masuichi, an official of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tianjin by plane from Dalian at 11:00 AM on the 13th.

In the afternoon, he went to the consulate to negotiate with Kawagoe on behalf of Foreign Minister Arita. It is reported that Kawagoe has been internally appointed as the Ambassador to China. Kawagoe will fly back to Japan to visit Arita in the next few days. Zumi will stay in Tianjin for two days and then go to the Ping-Sui Railway to inspect the current situation in North China before returning to Japan via the Northeast. (13th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to the Tianjin Japanese Consulate-General, there is no problem with Kawagoe's promotion to Ambassador to China. It is only a matter of obtaining the consent of the related parties, because Kawagoe is on good terms with Lieutenant General Umezu Yoshijiro and the general leaders of the army, which will enable him to obtain the support of the military in China.

<h3>Matsumuro and Hamada Go to Tianjin from Beijing to Wait for Nagami</h3>
<p>(Beijing) The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy is about to begin negotiations soon. Nagami Toshiyoshi is expected to arrive in Tianjin from Japan on the 15th or 16th. Matsumuro Takayoshi went to Tianjin with Hamada at 9:00 AM this morning to wait for the meeting. Generally, people expect that Nagami will bring new opinions from the Japanese government this time. How the future will develop is very noteworthy. According to the spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee, after the committee sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese Embassy on the case of Koreans occupying houses and selling drugs, Japan agreed to do its best to assist. (13th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsumuro Takayoshi came to Tianjin from Beijing at noon on the 13th. In the afternoon, he met with Tada and Takeashita, the head of the Special Agency of the Yuguan Army, Kouchi, the head of the Special Agency of the Taiyuan Army, Iyuayama, the Special Agency of the Suiyuan Army, Oomoto, the military liaison officer in Zhangjiakou, and Ishii and Dogane, the staff officers of the Tianjin Army, at the Zhangyuan official residence to discuss the issue of anti-communism in North China and waited for the meeting with Nagami in Tianjin. According to the Tianjin Army, Nagami's return to the country for instructions must be postponed until the 17th to return to Tianjin. Recently, Tianjin has not heard of the exact date of his return. Matsumuro said that he has no mission this time and will stay in Tianjin for a few days and return to Beijing on the 15th and does not intend to meet with Song and Xiao. The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy will not be formally negotiated until Chairman Song returns to Beijing to make concrete decisions. The abolition of the Hebei-Eastern government will also depend on the outcome of the negotiations. The expansion of the Japanese garrison in North China has been roughly decided and is scheduled to be implemented in June. The number cannot be told. (13th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Zhang Zizhong, Ke Changsi, and Ma Yanchong arrived in Beijing from Chahar at 6:40 PM tonight and are scheduled to go to Tianjin with Qin Dechun on the evening of the 15th or 16th to celebrate Song's mother's birthday. Chen Zhongfu is also scheduled to go to Tianjin on the evening of the 15th. Song is scheduled to inspect the counties south of Tianjin after the 16th. Song told reporters that the only work in North China at present is to prevent communism, because the Communist Party initially came to China with only 17 people, and their actions were good. The current Communist Party belongs to bandits and will resolutely prevent them with all their strength. (13th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Qin Dechun is scheduled to participate in the Qingjie large cleaning movement in Beijing on the 15th before going to Tianjin to celebrate Song's mother's birthday and then follow Song on inspection. (13th, Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beijing) Regarding the two issues of Koreans forcibly occupying civilian houses and selling drugs in Beijing, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council previously ordered the Foreign Affairs Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side to ban them. On the 13th, according to the spokesperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the results of the negotiations on the above two issues are extremely satisfactory. Japan agreed to assist in strictly banning Koreans from selling drugs and forcibly occupying civilian houses, but hoped that the Chinese authorities would provide strong guarantees to Koreans in Beijing with formal documents.

<h3>The Kwantung Army Announces That Officials of the Puppet State Planned a Mutiny. The Governor of Xing'an Province and Six Others Communicated with Russia. They Were Arrested and Sent to Changchun for Military Trial.</h3>
<p>(Changchun) A shocking piece of news has been revealed here: six high-ranking officials of the puppet state, including Ling Sheng, the current governor of the puppet Xing'an North Province, secretly plotted to oppose the puppet regime and resist Japan in order to overthrow "Manchukuo." The matter was exposed, and they were arrested and will be subjected to military trial. According to the Kwantung Army, Ling Sheng colluded with representatives of the Soviet Union and Mongolia when he was appointed by the puppet state last October as a representative to negotiate the Halaha incident, secretly opposing the puppet regime and resisting Japan and establishing an Inner Mongolia People's Government in imitation of Outer Mongolia. Recently, he was in close contact with messengers from the Soviet Union and Mongolia, which led to his discovery. It is also claimed that the repeated serious attacks by the Soviet and Mongolian armies on the border lines of the Japanese and puppet troops were the result of these people leaking military secrets. It is found that Ling Sheng and others are all Inner Mongolians. In addition to the six people who have now been prosecuted, there are dozens of other suspects under detention. It is said that many Mongolian puppet officials are now under invisible surveillance. (Hualian dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Parliament Will Convene. Hirota Plans to Formulate a Policy Program</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The 69th Extraordinary Session of Parliament, the first test for the Hirota Cabinet, is just two weeks away. The Cabinet has already decided on the supplementary budget proposal to be submitted, as well as 26 important bills related to the budget. After the political officials have discussed and finalized them on the 14th, all Cabinet members will work together to ensure a complete parliamentary strategy. The special session will last only three weeks, but it must deliberate on a national defense budget of more than 1 billion yuan aimed at breaking the current emergency situation, as well as various important bills. Therefore, in terms of both quality and quantity, its importance is above that of a regular session. The government is approaching it with an extremely cautious attitude. However, the characteristic of this session is that the Cabinet is under heavy pressure from the current situation, so it is only submitting the maximum number of proposals. It is doubtful whether many of the important cases can be deliberated and completed in a short period of time as the government expects. There is already talk of extending the session, as it is expected that there will be many difficulties. (Dentsu dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota's policy speech at the 69th Extraordinary Session of Parliament is currently being drafted by Chief Secretary Fujinuma and will be formally decided by the Cabinet on the 28th. The main points can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Government in Dealing with the February 26th Incident. The government recognizes that the current situation is difficult and will strive to establish a strong national policy in order to break the emergency situation. It hopes that political parties, the military, and bureaucrats will put aside their differences and work together to remove the budget.</p>
<p>The Dignity of the National Constitution and National Law and the Clarity of the National Polity. It goes without saying that any ideas incompatible with the national polity will be rejected. Maintaining the dignity of the national constitution and national law is the most important task in the current situation.</p>
<p>Enhancing National Defense and Foreign Policy. Based on the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, it will strive for the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asian countries and the stability of East Asia. In view of the current international situation, it will strive to enhance national defense and establish an independent and active foreign policy.</p>
<p>Reform of the Tax System and Finance, and Revitalization of the Financial Economy. It will strive for stability and improvement in all aspects of national life and implement thorough policies from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Reform of the Administrative Structure. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Economic Negotiations Between China and the United States. Pittman Expresses Support</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, the leader of the silver bloc, has always fundamentally opposed China's currency management plan. However, he is very supportive of the Chinese banking delegation led by Chen Guangfu, who came to the United States for inspection. Pittman said that he did not participate in the conversation between Chen and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, but he believes that the establishment of a branch of the Bank of China in the United States will increase trade between China and the United States and stabilize the relationship between the Chinese currency and the US dollar. Although he himself has not met Chen, and the purpose of Chen's visit to the United States has not been formally notified, the establishment of a branch of the Bank of China in the United States has long been needed. Therefore, although he does not believe that China's currency management is a stable plan, the establishment of a branch is a useful step. Pittman added that the United States does not need to negotiate broad currency issues with China because the US silver plan is progressing "smoothly." Therefore, if other countries cannot provide special silver preparation, they will have a significant impact on the world's economic events. Therefore, the United States should let other countries beg for help and not lose its advantageous position. Moreover, it is not yet known how long the current currency system of any country will last. If the United States can act cautiously and maintain its own position, it can help the whole world in the future. At the same time, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau hosted a banquet for the Chinese delegation tonight. Invited to accompany them were Speaker of the House Byrns and several members of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and the Senate. This is the end of the first week after the Chinese delegation consulted with Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. According to reliable sources, the issues discussed were roughly the price and status of silver. Detailed information has not yet been announced. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from General Badoglio, the Supreme Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, "The Italian army on the northern front is advancing smoothly. One detachment departed from Gondar City and occupied the Gorgora Peninsula on Lake Tana on the 12th, immediately raising the Italian flag. The local residents all expressed cheers to our army. While advancing, our army is also building roads. There is now a motor road that can directly reach between Lake Tana and Gondar City. Another detachment from Madaha, carrying the fastest tanks, has recently advanced to the Galabat area west of Gondar City and occupied a customs post. In addition, a team of indigenous troops from the Italian Aosta tribe clashed with a large Abyssinian army near Waldala City on the southern front. After a fierce battle, the Abyssinian army was defeated and retreated. In summary, on both the northern and southern fronts, our army suffered only 46 white soldiers killed and wounded, while the enemy suffered heavy losses." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to predictions from diplomatic circles here, Italy's invasion of Abyssinia is actually the beginning of the Anglo-Italian struggle for hegemony in the Mediterranean, and the only way to resolve it is through war. Although both sides are trying to maintain calm on the surface, they are both making great efforts in their deployments in the Mediterranean. From the British point of view, Italy's invasion of Abyssinia aims to control the southeastern Mediterranean. However, from the Italian point of view, Britain does not want another strong country to appear in the Mediterranean, so it is making every effort to adopt an anti-Italian attitude in Geneva. According to British sources, Italy's naval defenses in the Adriatic and Mediterranean are becoming increasingly strong. In addition, the existing air force bases in Sicily, Libya, Sardinia, and Eritrea are being greatly expanded, and many new bases are being added. The planning of their distances allows them to respond to each other within a few hours. At the same time, Italy's air force strength in Tripoli and Benghazi has also greatly increased. As for Britain, according to Italian reports, it is gradually completing its defense projects in Cyprus, Haifa, Palma, Egypt, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council recently issued an application to Italy and Abyssinia, asking them to take various measures to ensure that the methods of warfare adopted would not violate international agreements. Abyssinian Foreign Minister Heruy recently submitted a reply to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating, "Your telegram of the 9th has been duly noted. Our country is strictly complying with all international agreements in the methods of warfare adopted in the struggle with the invading country. Even if the Italian army has repeatedly and conspicuously violated international agreements, Abyssinia has not retaliated. However, it is possible that individual Abyssinian soldiers may be filled with righteous indignation and react because of the Italian army's inhumane actions. However, these are isolated incidents and cannot be generalized. The Abyssinian government has now taken various measures and will severely punish any future violations of international agreements." In addition, the Abyssinian government recently requested the Thirteen-Nation Committee to summon Polish physician Perro to attend the meeting to provide testimony on the Italian army's atrocities. Regarding this matter, Italian Foreign Minister Suvich sent a telegram to Avenol, revealing the physician's identity. According to him, his real name is Perlov, not a physician. He previously served in the Polish army and deserted in 1922, fleeing to other countries. After the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War, he joined the Abyssinian Red Cross rescue team. Not long ago, he deserted again. With such a character, how can he be trusted? (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Gold Reserves Decline Sharply, Decreasing by 500 Million Lire Per Month</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to the Business Daily, Italy's national bank's gold reserves are decreasing by 500,000,000 lire per month due to heavy government spending. Other expenses, which are paid under the government's collection of gold and foreign currency from the public, are not included. The Italian bank's gold reserves are now less than 1,500,000,000 lire. "The war expenses in East Africa have exceeded 7,000,000,000 lire to date. Although the Italian army has recently won victories on all fronts, the war will end in several months, and after the ceasefire, the expeditionary force must be sent back home, which will also be costly. Therefore, the total war expenses, including past and future expenses, will reach 12,000,000,000 lire." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister Dies. Cabinet Reorganized and Established</h3>
<p>(Athens) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demertzis suddenly died of a stroke last night while sleeping soundly. His family did not know at first. It was not until they opened the door to his bedroom this morning that they found him dead for a long time. Demertzis was originally a famous civil law scholar and served as Minister of Education. When King George II returned to the country to restore the throne last winter, he ordered the late Regent General Kondylis to pardon political prisoners. Kondylis refused to comply, so the King ordered Demertzis to form a new cabinet. At that time, Demertzis was serving as a professor of civil law at the University of Athens. The Parliament then held a by-election in January of this year. After the election ended, Demertzis submitted his resignation to the King as usual. The King ordered him to stay in office temporarily because the new Parliament had not yet been formally established. When the Parliament opened in February, the King ordered the Speaker of the Parliament, Sophoulis, to form a cabinet, but he failed. After repeated deliberations, the King still ordered Demertzis to continue to form a cabinet. He finally formed a new cabinet on March 12 and served until now. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Athens) After the death of Prime Minister Demertzis, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Army Metaxas submitted the cabinet's resignation on behalf of the cabinet this morning. King George II entrusted Metaxas to form a new cabinet, which was announced and sworn in at 5 PM. The position of Foreign Minister is concurrently held by Metaxas, and all other cabinet members have been reappointed. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>English Cabinet Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Discussing German, French, Italian and Abyssinian Issues; Eden May Visit Berlin</p>
<p>(London) A political reporter for the Daily Telegraph recently stated that Prime Minister Baldwin had a telephone conversation with Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday. Following this conversation, several key cabinet members will hold a meeting tomorrow to thoroughly discuss the current international situation. It is understood that if the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen fails in its mediation efforts regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, thereby necessitating intensified sanctions against Italy, the instructions Foreign Secretary Eden should follow in acting as an intermediary will be determined at tomorrow's meeting. The broad outlines of the policy the cabinet should adopt regarding this matter have already been decided, and there was originally no need to hold another meeting. However, due to the sudden increase in tension in the international situation last week, the cabinet had no choice but to give Foreign Secretary Eden more precise instructions. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. According to sources interviewed by this newspaper, the issues to be discussed include: Intensifying sanctions against Italy; Matters to be discussed with the German government; Talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium; and Amendments to the League of Nations Covenant. Before the meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden will confer with his cabinet colleagues by telephone to prepare for making decisions. Regarding the first issue, British public opinion has recently been strongly advocating intensified sanctions against Italy. Official sources have also stated that only the most severe sanctions will be effective in dealing with Italy. However, this view is opposed by a majority of cabinet members, who believe that even an oil embargo would likely be ineffective. As for measures of a military nature, such as blockading the Suez Canal, they are considered too dangerous, and the government cannot take such risks merely to satisfy the opposition. However, most members of Parliament and journalists, particularly those on the left, oppose any compromise with Italy, believing that if the British government were to do so, it could not take a firm stance towards Germany. The government currently hopes to postpone negotiations with Germany, so that a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute may be found in the meantime. Regarding the second issue, the British government is expected to begin negotiations with Germany this week. However, due to the recent sudden death of the German ambassador to Britain, Herr von Hoesch, these negotiations may be delayed. Regarding the third issue, the date for the general staff talks has been set for the 15th of this month. Regarding the fourth issue, many political figures advocate amending the League of Nations Covenant to limit the League's powers. In general, if the cabinet is forced to abandon the sanctions policy, it will likely adopt the proposal to amend the Covenant. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) After returning from Geneva, Foreign Secretary Eden went to Limpsfield to spend the Easter holiday. He has now returned to London by car with his wife and son. Tomorrow, he may meet with Prime Minister Baldwin and other cabinet members to report on the proceedings of the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen and the Locarno two-power conference. The Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to resume its meetings on Thursday, and Foreign Secretary Eden will attend on that day. However, the cabinet will certainly give him new instructions before his departure. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to The Sunday Chronicle, Foreign Secretary Eden may visit Berlin to discuss the future basis of Franco-German reconciliation with German Chancellor Hitler. The newspaper predicts that the British Foreign Secretary will ask the German Chancellor not to increase defensive works in the Rhineland region during the negotiation of a new agreement. The newspaper also stated that if the German side responds by citing the need to defend against French attack, Eden will make it clear to Germany that if Germany adheres to the spirit of the Locarno Treaty and is attacked by France, Germany can expect British assistance. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) There are rumors that Foreign Secretary Eden may travel to Germany to meet with the country's leader, Hitler, in order to clarify the international situation. This rumor has not been confirmed. In addition, today is still an Easter holiday, and it is impossible to inquire about accurate information. Foreign Secretary Eden, together with former Foreign Secretary Simon (the current Home Secretary), once visited Berlin in March of last year, and then went to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, in an attempt to contribute to the collective security plan. The result was still in vain. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources interviewed by this newspaper, left-wing members of the British Conservative Party have now abandoned their advocacy of "extreme sanctions" regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. They also believe that the League of Nations' handling of the dispute has failed, and that the British government should acknowledge this and change its policy in the future to focus its efforts on purely European affairs. However, the majority of public opinion still supports the League of Nations policy. Therefore, as long as the "National Government" remains unchanged, the policies of the left-wing members of the Conservative Party will not be adopted by the government. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Austria Strictly Prevents Disturbances: National Socialist Party Greatly Increases Activities</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian government is today preparing to prevent the National Socialist Party from staging another revolution similar to the assassination of former Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934. A government spokesperson stated today that the fear of such events has increased because the National Socialist Party's activities throughout the country are very prominent. The government is also unable to completely prevent the smuggling of military arms across the German-Austrian border. The police have been ordered to arrest leaders of local party branches throughout the country, with particular attention paid to the southern regions. At the same time, the national military police have been ordered to "be on alert," resulting in overcrowding in reformatories throughout the country. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Former Mexican President Expelled; Ten Thousand Workers March</h3>
<p>Loyal to the Current President</p>
<p>Mexico City General Calles, the former president, has been deported, to the great delight of the people. Today, ten thousand workers marched in demonstration to oppose "Calles' terrorism" and to express loyalty to the current President Cárdenas. The remains of five firefighters who died when a train from Veracruz was bombed en route to the capital were carried in the march and placed before the presidential palace to mourn. Many speeches were given attacking General Calles and demanding that the government confiscate all of his property. The president's private secretary, Rodriguez, addressed the crowd, saying that the great enemy of political reform has been removed, and the new government, which is favorable to the working class, will intensify its efforts.

<h3>Indian National Congress Convention: President Bitterly Criticizes New Constitution</h3>
<p>Calling It a Slave-like Constitution</p>
<p>Lucknow At the plenary session of the All-India Congress held today, President Nehru delivered a speech, pointing out that the new Indian Constitution is a slave-like charter aimed at consolidating the shackles of British imperial rule. He urged members of the All-India Congress to use the new constitution to seize legislative power and to use this legislative power as a basis for carrying out its economic program and creating a political stalemate. Yesterday, the Congress Affairs Committee decided to temporarily postpone the resolution on whether Congress members could accept official positions under the new constitution, so the president's remarks were of less interest. At the close of the meeting, the Socialist faction of the Congress proposed a motion advocating that Congress members should not assume responsibility and should adopt a plan that could undermine the new constitution. However, this proposal was defeated by a vote of 44 to 23. Former President Gandhi also attended the meeting. It is noted that the new Indian Constitution was passed by the British Parliament last summer, allowing the 350 million people of India to enjoy self-government. The central and provincial governments are organized, and their ministers are responsible to the legislature, just as British ministers are responsible to Parliament. Defense, foreign affairs, and religious affairs are presided over by the governor-general, and as for other matters, the governor-general and provincial governors will act according to the ministers' suggestions, provided that it does not hinder the maintenance of public order, the protection of the interests of minorities, or special responsibilities for financial stability. According to this new constitution, Burma has separated from India, and a constitution with the same general purpose as the new Indian constitution has been promulgated. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>South American Countries Advocate Establishing a League of American Nations</h3>
<p>Cooperating with the League of Nations in Geneva</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt proposed convening a Pan-American Peace Conference, the governments of Latin American countries have all responded one after another. Their replies were recently published by the State Department. Among them, President López of Colombia, President Trujillo of Santo Domingo, and President Ubico of Guatemala all advocated the establishment of a League of American Nations to cooperate with the League of Nations in Geneva, but when events occur in the Americas, it should be handled with greater force. Secretary of State Hull also told reporters that the Pan-American Peace Conference may be convened at the end of July or in August of this year. The US government has not yet decided on its agenda.

<h3>South Irish Independence Day</h3>
<p>(London) A clash occurred between the South Irish Republican Army and onlookers during a parade in Dublin today to commemorate those who died in the Dublin riots of 1916, injuring hundreds. The parade marched from the city center to Glasnevin Cemetery, and included members of the Republican Congress and Communists. Some onlookers cheered, while others cursed, and stones were thrown, leading to a brawl. Police were forced to use batons to restore order. When the parade reached the entrance to the cemetery, someone shouted, "This is a Catholic cemetery. Communists are not allowed in!" But the Communist members ignored them, leading to an attack by the crowd, and many were injured in the ensuing chaos. On Easter Monday in 1916, 700 Irishmen occupied Dublin and resisted 20,000 British soldiers for a week. The rebels fought bravely, and many died. They only surrendered when the British soldiers bombarded them with artillery. The military authorities later arrested 3,000 people. Except for the current South Irish Free State Executive Chairman, Van Lear, and two others who had their sentences reduced, all the rebel leaders were shot. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Roger Casement, a deceased Irish patriot who was one of the leaders of the South Irish independence movement in 1916, was buried in England after his death. South Irish people have requested that his remains be returned to his homeland, but the British government has refused. Today, on the anniversary of the independence movement, several hundred South Irish expatriates held a meeting in Hyde Park to protest this attitude of the British government. A resolution was passed advocating that the South Irish government should make representations to Britain through diplomatic channels. It was raining at the time, and the demonstrators stood in the rain holding the flag of the Free State. One of them gave a speech saying, "We commemorate Sir Roger Casement, just as the British commemorate Nurse Cavell (a British nurse who was suspected of being a spy by the German army during the European War and executed)." When the rain stopped, a crowd of onlookers gathered, numbering several thousand. No incidents occurred. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Requests Restoration of Military Preparations in the Straits</h3>
<p>Full Text of Note Published</p>
<p>The Turkish government in the capital recently sent a note to the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, namely England, France, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia, regarding Article 18 of the treaty, which concerns the abolition of military preparations and freedom of navigation in the Dardanelles Strait, requesting that it be amended. The full text of the note has recently been published, and it roughly states, "When the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923, the Turkish government could not consider the collective guarantee that the League of Nations Covenant could provide to be satisfactory. Therefore, it requested that the four countries of England, France, Italy, and Japan jointly guarantee this, which was the minimum limit for ensuring the integrity of Turkish territory. However, since then, the general situation in Europe, both militarily and politically, has greatly changed. In the Mediterranean, there is a general sense of unrest. As a result of the two London Naval Conferences, the trend in all countries is to rearm in the air and at sea. Land defenses are constantly being expanded. As for the political aspect, incidents have occurred one after another, which is sufficient to prove that the application of the principle of collective security is too slow. The times have changed so much that it is doubtful whether the four guarantor countries are now in a position where they can still cooperate militarily to deal with possible events." The conclusion states, "In view of this, the Turkish government is now prepared to conduct negotiations so that, under conditions of security, namely guaranteeing the inviolability of Turkish territory and the necessary conditions for the development of shipping between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, an agreement can be established immediately to formulate a new system for the Dardanelles Strait, which would be very fortunate."

<p>Ugaki Kazushige Arrives in Tokyo</p>
<p>Ugaki Kazushige, the Governor-General of Korea, arrived in Tokyo from Korea on the morning of the 13th. Ugaki has been serving as Governor-General for five years, and there is no intention to keep him in the same position, so the question of his advancement or resignation has attracted much attention. However, the government believes that the Governor-General of Korea is an important position and cannot be easily changed, so unless Ugaki actively expresses his resignation, it does not intend to consider this issue. It is reported that Ugaki will stay in Tokyo for about ten days. (Domei News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Internal strife within the Seiyukai party has always been a specialty of the Tokyo political scene, and the world has ceased to pay much attention to it. Recently, since President Suzuki failed to win re-election in the previous general election, the party and the Suzuki faction (Kuhara faction, former Seiyukai faction, Tokonami faction) have shown even less restraint in their contempt for the president. As a result, rumors of Suzuki's resignation have become widespread. Originally, Suzuki Kisaburo's succession to Inukai Tsuyoshi as president was already the result of a party struggle that was fraught with difficulties. Unexpectedly, Suzuki himself was not understood by the voters, and he lost his seat, causing the presidential faction to lose its footing and courage. It is natural that the opposition faction will take the opportunity to rise. On the one hand, the Showakai faction (the Mochizuki faction, Yamazaki faction, Uchida faction, and part of the Tokonami faction within the former Seiyukai), which withdrew from the Seiyukai in order to cooperate with the Okada cabinet, suddenly lost its support due to the February 26th coup. There is also the symbol of "when the tree falls, the monkeys scatter." At this juncture, the influence of the former Seiyukai faction led by Maeda Yonezo is growing within the Seiyukai, and the Yamazaki faction within the Showakai is a "friend in the enemy's camp" of that faction. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the Yamazaki faction returns to the Seiyukai and cooperates with the Maeda faction to replace the Suzuki faction. Furthermore, if Suzuki is forced to resign, the return of the Mochizuki faction within the Showakai to the Seiyukai is also possible due to the Yamazaki faction's connection. If so, then the Tokonami faction within the Showakai will also inevitably turn around and join the former Tokonami faction within the Seiyukai. In that case, the Showakai will eventually only be left with the pure Uchida faction, and the Seiyukai's lineup can thus be expanded. However, there is still the most important question: after Suzuki's resignation, who will the Seiyukai belong to? Kuhara? Maeda? Mochizuki? Yamamoto? Especially after the sudden death of Kawasaki Takukichi, who was seen as a candidate for president, the issue of the successor to the presidency is even more contentious due to the fierce internal strife within the party. Therefore, the only solution is to follow the precedent of welcoming Tanaka Giichi as president, and to find someone from outside the party who has sufficient financial resources and prestige to preside over all factions, and welcome him as the leader. Who is that person? It is the current Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige. Therefore, the issue of Ugaki Kazushige, the "political comet" who aspires to be the future prime minister, joining the Seiyukai will set off considerable waves in the Japanese political scene after the extraordinary session of the Diet. The Maeda faction's active expansion of its strength in the hope of controlling the party's leadership is also intended to achieve this goal. (Hualian News Agency Communication)</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Technical Cooperation Between China and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Gu Huimin</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations Bulletin, the China Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council met in March to discuss the current state of technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations and the plans for 1936. The technical cooperation program between China and the League of Nations began in 1931 with the aim of utilizing the League's technical bodies to assist the Chinese Economic Committee in promoting national construction.</p>
<p>The 1936 plan continues to be based on past cooperation programs. The Technical Cooperation Office in Nanjing continues to operate. The contract of rural cooperation expert Campbell has been renewed upon expiration. Agriculture is the most important issue in China, and the Chinese Economic Committee pays particular attention to this area. In recent years, rural cooperatives have progressed rapidly. The National Government recognizes their significant impact and believes that they should be promoted with reference to reasonable regulations from various countries. It has decided to hire top-tier technical experts to come to China for guidance. At the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations assigned Campbell to this task. Campbell previously managed rural cooperation in Ceylon and has a strong reputation. He took office in China in July 1935 and is expected to achieve good results, but it will take several years.</p>
<p>Italian M.B. Mari is another expert who came to China under the cooperation plan. He came to China in the autumn of 1932. At the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations Economic Section sent him to investigate the development and improvement of the Chinese silk industry. He is currently a technical advisor on sericulture for the Economic Committee.</p>
<p>The Chinese Economic Committee often consults the League of Nations Communications and Transit Section. Personnel from the Communications and Transit Section also make every effort to provide guidance to the Chinese government on roads, river dredging, water conservancy, and other related issues.</p>
<p>In 1935, at the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations Communications and Transit Section sent several outstanding experts to study important issues in China. From December 1934 to the spring of 1935, a survey team composed of four experts from the League of Nations conducted detailed preliminary research in China, collecting valuable technical reference materials. Later, with the assistance of another expert, a comprehensive report documenting the experts' research findings was published. It included the Huai River Project, North China Waterways, Fen River Project, Yellow River Control Project, Xiaoching River Dredging Project, Yongding River Water Storage Facilities, various issues related to the Yangtze River, Shanxi Hydropower, Suiyuan Irrigation, and road and transportation issues.</p>
<p>Dutch M. Bourdrea of the League of Nations Transport Section arrived in China in early 1932 and is currently an expert in hydraulic engineering, especially river management projects, for the Economic Committee.</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations sent an expert survey team to China last year, the chairman of the Communications and Transport Technical Advisory Committee, in order to ensure that the various helpful suggestions are implemented, sent expert M. Coursin to China. Coursin is an engineer from the French government's Public Works Department and a supervisor of public works in Madagascar. He represents the League of Nations Technical Advisory Committee and liaises with the Chinese Economic Committee. Coursin went to China in 1935. His mission is scheduled to be completed on October 15, 1936, after which he will report his observations to the chairman of the Technical Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding health, the Chinese government had already suggested cooperation with the League of Nations Health Section at the end of 1929; the League of Nations Administrative Council agreed in May 1930. Subsequently, from May 1930 to the end of 1934, Dr. B. Borcie, representing the League of Nations Health Section, provided technical cooperation with the Chinese government's Department of Health, with very significant results.</p>
<p>Dr. A. Stampar, Honorary Supervisor of the Yugoslav Public Health Department and former member of the League of Nations Health Committee, was also hired by the Chinese National Economic Committee and the Department of Health in September 1933. This was done in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council Health Committee on July 18, 1933. His task was to carry out rural reconstruction work with Ha of the Economic Committee. At that time, the Economic Committee decided to focus its efforts on construction work in the Northwest (Shaanxi, Gansu) and Jiangxi. Why were these two locations chosen to start with? Mostly because agricultural disasters there were severe, and the main reason was the prevalence of infectious diseases among the people and livestock, especially serious in the Northwest. Since November 1933, Stampar has been conducting on-the-ground research into health conditions in these provinces, until the end of 1935. Technically, he has studied Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Hebei.</p>
<p>Recently, the China Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council, at the request of the Chinese representative, resolved on a new avenue for technical cooperation: the Chinese Economic Committee may send experts abroad to study the latest knowledge on national construction, finance, health, water conservancy, and other issues. These many Chinese experts can use the files and equipment of the League of Nations technical bodies and the Secretariat to learn from experience and to investigate the actual situation of administration and construction in various countries. The Chinese government will work with the League of Nations Secretariat to handle various necessary procedures. These Chinese experts are temporarily considered employees of the League of Nations Secretariat, and they can obtain various conveniences in Geneva because the files of the League of Nations Secretariat and the International Labor Office are available for them to consult. Various countries also provide them with research facilities and opportunities. After completing preliminary research at the League of Nations Secretariat, they can also organize temporary observation groups to explore various countries, according to a plan formulated by the Secretariat.</p>

<p>The Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs Becomes Almost a Free Port; Smuggling Groups More Rampant Than Before</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The suppression of smuggling in North China has recently been disrupted because Lin Shize and Xi Zhongmou, the supervisors of the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs, have not returned from Beijing where they were seeking instructions on how to proceed. The anti-smuggling agreement between the Customs and the railway is not being earnestly implemented by customs and railway personnel due to fear of repercussions. This has led to smuggling becoming more rampant than before. Every day, 2,000 to 3,500 tons of smuggled goods, including sugar, rayon, piece goods, and porcelain, are transported from eastern Hebei. The Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs has virtually become a free port. All kinds of goods from a certain country that can be sold in North China are transported through smuggling channels. Smuggling rings have established Xu Transport Company in Liushouying in Beidaihe, Zheng Rong Foreign Firm Transportation Department in Changli, Nanda Temple Transport Company in Nanda Temple, and Changhong Company in Aoxian, specializing in receiving and transporting smuggled goods. Each company employs dozens to hundreds of die-hard followers, equipped with weapons and wearing badges of the Youth League, making them extremely fierce and unreasonable. The above-mentioned smuggling companies are currently employing workers to build steel warehouses in various locations to temporarily store goods that cannot be loaded onto vehicles immediately after being unloaded from ships. It appears that they intend to permanently maintain this smuggling organization.</p>
<p>The amount of smuggled goods accumulated in various places in eastern Luan County is so great that the Beijing-Shenyang Railway cannot provide enough carriages, and goods are unloaded on the coast and at various stations in uncountable quantities. Taking a certain concession in Tianjin as an example, it currently has 1.3 million pieces of rayon and 130,000 bags of sugar stockpiled. Smuggled goods arrive at the East General Station daily, and armed vagrants guard the area while unloading takes time, preventing people from approaching. Even customs personnel can do nothing about it. Recently, more than a dozen soldiers from a certain country's military police force have been stationed at the station, ostensibly to protect the safety of Japanese residents and travelers, but secretly to facilitate smuggling. Therefore, smugglers are becoming increasingly rampant, acting as if they are in a lawless land. Recently, as the ice in the Ziya, Daqing, and North-South Canals has melted, boats have begun to pass through. Vagrants are hiring civilian boats to transport goods to remote rural areas. Since our inland regular customs have been withdrawn long ago, and there is no legitimate agency responsible for suppressing smuggling, we can only let it run rampant. Many foreign firms have been established on Ming Shi, Miyajima, Fukushima, and Akiyama Streets in a certain concession this week. All are engaged in smuggling. Smuggled goods have nowhere to be stored, so they are placed on the sidewalks. At night, heavy trucks are hired, displaying the flags of the International Transportation Company, to transport the goods out of the city and then transfer them to vehicles and ships at waterfront wharves near the suburbs. North China customs revenue is only collected at the Tianjin Customs, and the implementation of new anti-smuggling measures has failed to yield results in the past two weeks, resulting in a loss of over 200,000 yuan in customs revenue. If this continues, the future of customs revenue is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Under the control of certain foreigners, the puppet Eastern Hebei government established eight customs inspection posts in Liushouying, Beidaihe, Yanghekou, Luanhekou, Changli, Aoxian, Beitang, and Tanggu in April. Personnel from a certain country are transferring puppet customs officers to serve there. Currently, taxes are only levied on imported foreign goods, and export taxes are being planned and will soon be collected as well. Because the puppet government's establishment of the Beitang Inspection Post is close to the Tianjin Customs and intends to seize the Changlu Salt Tax, the authorities have negotiated repeatedly. With the consent of a certain country, the puppet government agreed to postpone the establishment temporarily. The other seven posts have been levying taxes separately at the lowest tax rates. Due to the excessive amount of smuggled goods being transported, a certain concession in Tianjin has no place to store them, so they are renting rooms in the British and French concessions for storage. On the 10th of this month, the Tianjin Customs seized two cases on No. 24 Road and No. 30 Road in the French concession. The goods have been transported to the Customs and detained. The Customs has recently revised its anti-smuggling informant policy. Anyone who reports smuggling will be rewarded with a quarter of the auction value of the smuggled goods seized by the Customs after verification. However, a gang of vagrants, knowing that the Customs is unable to suppress smuggling effectively, is using the informant policy to swindle money from the Customs, causing the Customs to be overwhelmed and allowing the smuggling to run rampant.

<h3>Shandong: The Yellow River Experiences a Sharp Rise in All Three Reaches</h3>
<p>Unprecedented for the Peach Blossom Flood Season; Zhang Yue Goes to Dongzhuang to Inspect the Closing of the Gap</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong River Affairs Bureau recently received a report from the Baotou Hydrological Station in Suiyuan, forwarded by Kong Xiangrong, stating that the water level of the Yellow River in various reaches of Suiyuan Province had suddenly risen to 89.91 meters due to ice jams and fluctuating temperatures, and the flow rate had suddenly increased to 2,960 cubic meters per second. The main current will reach Shandong soon. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau has been requested to order strict precautions along the various reaches of the river. The flood peak has now reached Shandong, causing a significant rise in the Yellow River in Shandong and Anhui. According to information obtained by the River Affairs Bureau, the water level at Luokou today (11th) has reached 28.7 meters, only a little more than 3 meters below the flood level of 31 meters. This is unprecedented for the peach blossom flood season. The reason for this is nothing more than the siltation of the river channel and the sedimentation of the riverbed. The River Affairs Bureau has ordered all officials to strengthen precautions to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>The Dongzhuang Yellow River breach closure project in Shandong has already successfully closed the dragon's breath, and the follow-up work will be completed within days. It will be handed over to the Shandong Provincial Government for acceptance. Kong Xiangrong has already sent a telegram to Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, stating this intention and requesting that personnel be sent to Dongzhuang to inspect everything first. Therefore, Han has specially appointed Zhang Yue, a member of the provincial government, to go to Dongzhuang to meet with Kong and discuss everything. Upon receiving the order, Zhang took the Pinghan train this morning (11th) in the rain to Xuzhou and then transferred to the Longhai Railway to Kaifeng before transferring to Dongzhuang to inspect the progress of the project after the closure of the gap. It is reported that the River Affairs Bureau will still be responsible for accepting everything in the future. (11th)</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Monopoly Established</h3>
<p>Raising 1.4 Million Yuan in Loans for Tea Merchants; Transportation is Expedited via the Wuhu-Tunxi and Beijing-Wuhu Railways</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Although the establishment of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Association has provoked opposition from Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai and the Qimen tea industry, who have requested a postponement of implementation, the Anhui-Jiangxi construction authorities believe that this measure is related to the future prosperity of the entire black tea foreign trade and have decided to proceed according to the original plan. Xia Gengying, the second section chief of the Anhui Construction Department, has been specially dispatched by the provincial government and has passed through Wuhu on his way to Qimen to begin registering tea merchants. The registration is subject to fifteen specific rules, with a minimum standard of a tea merchant having 3,000 yuan in capital, 200 cases of tea, and five years of experience in management. The standards will be raised gradually each year thereafter. The registration application must state the tea-making experience, the quantity of tea produced, the profit and loss of the selling price, the delivery location, the maximum amount of loan requested, and the repayment method for any shortfalls. After Xia arrived in Qimen, tea merchant representatives Xie Buti and Xu Jieping were invited to Qimen to assist, along with He Chongjie, the director of the Land Bureau. The reason for such proactive action is to establish the association before this year's tea market is launched. It is known that Qimen tea merchants have borrowed more than one million yuan from Shanghai tea warehouses (businesses engaged in black tea exports) in the past. It is now heard that the Transportation and Sales Association has decided to re-lend the money to Qimen merchants to repay the loans, thus avoiding being constrained. This fund of 1.12 million yuan has been raised by the Anhui Provincial Local Bank, with the Financial and Construction Departments raising 100,000 yuan each and the Jiangxi Provincial Government raising 80,000 yuan, totaling 1.4 million yuan, which should be sufficient. On the morning of the 12th, the head office of the Provincial Local Bank here has dispatched Wu Cunyuan, the manager of the Tunxi branch, to Qimen with a special car carrying various loan documents for application and immediate lending. The Bank of Communications has also decided to set up an office in Qimen during the tea season to assist with lending. Therefore, from this year onwards, all Qimen black tea will be packed locally and transported to Shanghai in a concentrated manner. The Transportation and Sales Association is considering three existing routes for Qimen tea: 1. via the Tunxi-Qimen Road to the Wuhu-Tunxi Road to Wuhu, and then by the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway directly to Shanghai; 2. via the Tunxi-Qimen Road to the Huizhou-Hangzhou Road to Hangzhou, and then by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shanghai; 3. the old transportation route, via Poyang Lake to Jiujiang, and then by river steamer to Shanghai. After consideration, it has been concluded that the Beijing-Wuhu Road is the most convenient. Therefore, preparations have been made to establish a transit agency in Wuhu. After Qimen tea is concentrated in Shanghai, the Evaluation Committee established in Shanghai will determine its balanced price, so that direct trade can be adopted with consumers. As a result, tea warehouses with a long history will now be eliminated. (12th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province: Tea Industry Opposes Tea Warehouse</h3>
<p>Tea Merchants Notify All Tea Warehouses Not to Pay Warehouse Rent Without Authorization</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Construction Department, considering the inadequacies of storage yards, handling, and barges for transporting tea from the Mindong Funing area last year, which caused significant damage to the tea leaves, has established a tea warehouse at the Taijiang general pier to improve the situation. However, the tea merchants feel greatly inconvenienced by the need to pay warehouse rent and the added complications, and they strongly oppose it. The tea warehouse manager has indicated to the merchants that the warehouse rent being collected this time is minimal and will be abolished next year. Now that this year's tea season has begun, the Construction Department has established a tea warehouse management office, appointing Ke Zhongzheng as the director, and has built a new tea warehouse at the Taijiang pier. All matters related to the transportation, unloading, storage, and inspection of tea from Mindong are handled by the office. In order to regulate tea prices and finance, it has consulted with the Provincial Bank, the Fuzhou Commercial Bank, and the Xintai Bank to have the Construction Department introduce tea merchants to these banks for overdrafts to provide relief. However, the Minhou Tea Industry Association has petitioned the provincial government to maintain the original plan and abolish the tea warehouse. The provincial government believes that the establishment of the tea warehouse is for the improvement of tea leaves and has ordered the Construction Department to plan and manage it properly, and has instructed that the Association's request for abolition should not be discussed. The Funing Tea Industry Association held a general meeting of all members a few days ago to discuss how to respond. All members expressed their opposition and decided to add more committee members to participate in the Executive Committee to assist in achieving the goal of abolition. They have notified all tea warehouses not to pay warehouse rent without authorization, and that tea merchants will not recognize this advance payment and cannot deduct it from the tea price when paying. After receiving the notice, the Hengyuantang Bag Tea Warehouse Public Association is in a dilemma because one side requires the collection of minimal tea warehouse rent, while the other side has decided not to pay it on behalf of the merchants. At this time of extremely tight credit and the busy season for business, coupled with the recent re-establishment of official teeth and business taxes for various tea warehouses by the Finance Department, the members of the Public Association who engage in the bag tea business, which involves large loans, are not the same as tooth-shops in nature. Moreover, tea leaves are already subject to special business tax, which is passed on to each other, increasing costs and making it difficult to compete with foreign teas. Therefore, they have adopted a passive approach and stopped lending to tea merchants. Upon hearing this news, the Gongyitang Box Tea Warehouse Public Association believes that many tea merchants are engaged in both box tea and bag tea. During the tea market season, bag tea comes first, followed by box tea. Often, the funds for box tea are used for bag tea, and box tea is not transported to the province until the selling price is determined. If lending for bag tea is stopped while lending for box tea continues, the box tea warehouses will suffer significant losses if the bag tea market declines in the province. Therefore, they have also decided to stop lending. However, at this early stage of tea production, most tea merchants in the province who are seeking loans are not getting their wishes, and they are all worried and in a dilemma. In this situation, both tea and tax revenue will inevitably be affected, and the livelihoods of various transportation, manufacturing, and labor workers related to tea will also be greatly impacted.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: High Court Reappoints Prison Warden</h3>
<p>Zheng Daquan, an official at the local prison, resigned from his post. After his resignation was approved by the High Court, Duanmu Sen was appointed to replace him. However, a month has passed and he has yet to arrive to take over the office. It has recently come to light that Duanmu has fallen ill after being appointed and is unable to assume his new position. He has telegraphed his resignation to the High Court, which has since appointed Hou Qixiang to succeed him as the local prison warden. Hou has arrived in Songjiang today and is scheduled to take office tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Former President of Jiangdu Court, Xu Zhixin, Accused of Malfeasance</h3>
<p>Xu Zhixin, the former president of the Jiangdu Local Court, was suspended from his position by a ministry order in July of last year. Because of irregularities in the handover of public funds during his tenure, Chen Ruizhen, a legal expert residing at No. 50 Banlian Lane in Suzhou, reported him to the Ministry of Justice, accusing Xu of malfeasance and embezzlement. After investigation, the Zhenjiang District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against Xu for crimes of malfeasance and embezzlement. Recently, Chen also accused Xu Zhixin of defamation in a complaint to the Zhenjiang Local Court. Xu was summoned by the Zhenjiang Local Court for trial the day before yesterday. Due to the seriousness of Xu's circumstances, he was detained pending further trial.</p>
<h3>Modern Female Thief with High Skills</h3>
<p>Thefts have been occurring frequently in Suzhou recently. The Public Security Bureau has been working hard to search for and arrest perpetrators. Over the past few days, more than twenty people have been arrested, and have been respectively sent to the court or to the vagrant vocational training center for re-education. Recently, there have been reports of modern women committing thefts in the city. A few days ago, a modern girl suddenly came to the Cai Shunxing carpentry shop in front of the Zhenfu Temple in the city. Under the pretext of shopping, she patted the wife of the worker on the shoulder and replaced her gold earrings with copper earrings. It was not until the girl had left that the theft was discovered. Surprisingly, at noon yesterday, two modern women with short hair and fashionable clothing suddenly came to the Wang surname schoolhouse at the entrance of Jiyou Lane on Hulong Street. Under the pretext of consulting on a subject, and as Wang was not in at the time, his mother entertained them. The two women then gently patted Wang's mother on the ears and left. Soon after, it was discovered that the gold earrings she was wearing had been replaced with copper ones. The swiftness of the technique was astonishing. Because the women had already gone far away, it was impossible to catch them. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau, after learning of the incident, has ordered his subordinates to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Robbery Occurs in Sanjia Market</h3>
<p>Li Changjun, a resident of Miaojing Township in the fifth district of Taicang County, is of modest means, leading to him being coveted by bandits. At around 1:00 AM on the 12th, more than twenty bandits suddenly arrived, broke down the door, and entered. Speaking in local and Hakka dialects, they each carried wooden sticks and ropes, drove the family members into one room, and tied them up one by one. The bandits, not knowing the location of the hidden money, tortured and threatened Li's mother. Because she was old and frail, she could not bear the suffering and fainted several times. After searching for over an hour, they robbed clothing, jewelry, and silver coins worth approximately 2,000 yuan. The victim has reported the incident to the district office in charge, which has forwarded the report to the county government for investigation. It is reported that Li's mother was seriously injured and is feared to be in danger of losing her life.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Crackdown on Morphine Injection Den</h3>
<p>Following the exposure and dismantling by the Public Security Bureau of the secret organization established by Monk Ying Ru of Juesheng Temple in Xishan Beimaopeng, where women were hidden in underground chambers to smoke opium, causing a sensation at the time, recently Monk Miaohua, also known as Xinlian, of Xiaonanhai Temple in Nanmen, addicted to opium, allegedly posed as Guan Yu (a Chinese God) to administer morphine injections to others, set up secret facilities, and hid raw materials, drugs, and smoking paraphernalia.  The case was secretly reported to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting their arrest.  Chief Hong of the Branch, upon receiving the report, immediately secretly ordered Tang Tu, a graduate police officer from the tenth class, to investigate and report back within three days.  Officer Tang, upon receiving the order, disguised himself and went to investigate thoroughly.  He then, together with special police chief Ren Changnian and others, led police officers to conduct a search.  Subsequently, in Miaohua's Guanfang chamber, they found two large bottles of liquid medicine, one package of morphine, one box of white powder, several boxes of syringes, two glass syringes for administering morphine, and gambling tools and opium pipes, totaling two large baskets.  They arrested the monk Miaohua, women Cai Shenshi and Miss Qiu, opium addicts Wu Ada and Xianghuo Xu Jinsheng, and Miaohua's nephew Guo Zeng'an, a total of six people, and took them to the Bureau.  Chief Hong of the Branch opened a court for preliminary interrogation.  According to Miaohua's confession, he was fifty years old, addicted to opium, and injected morphine himself at a cost of three jiao (Chinese cents) per injection.  He also admitted to administering injections to Zhu Liucai and others living at No. 1 Qiaotou in Nanshi.  During interrogation, Cai Shenshi confessed that last year, due to illness, she went to Xiaonanhai to seek a divine prescription, and they had people administer morphine injections to her.  When Wu Ada and others were questioned, they firmly denied receiving injections. After obtaining the confession, Chief Hong arrested Zhu Liucai from Changjing, and on the 13th (yesterday), transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Nantong: Water Police District Protects Fishing and Prevents Bandits</h3>
<p>The third district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, stationed in Tongzhou and Suzhou, convened a meeting on protecting fishing due to the approaching yellow croaker season along the coast of Jiangbei.  Measures for protecting fishing and preventing bandits were established.  The fishing areas under the jurisdiction of this district originally included Shengsi, Dongsha, and Lvsi.  Teams and naval vessels should be dispatched for patrol.  The Shengsi fishing area is to be the responsibility of the First Team and the Junhe warship.  The Dongsha fishing area, including Lvsi and Wuzhisha, is to be the responsibility of the First and Third Teams.  For patrolling the fishing grounds, in addition to the Junhe warship, the First and Second Teams will each provide one vessel, and the Third Team will provide five vessels.  If these are insufficient, they may be borrowed from nearby fishermen's associations.  Each patrol vessel will have two officers, two squads of water patrolmen, one steel cannon, one hand-held machine gun, seventeen rifles, and two Browning pistols.  The officers and police officers of each team patrolling the Dongsha fishing area will be under the command of their respective team leaders, with Dongsha as the base.  In addition, personnel will be dispatched from the district headquarters to supervise the diligence of the fishing protection units, and to assume unified command when necessary, in order to ensure close contact and mutual support.  The Second Team leader of the Shengsi fishing area, Li Jianling, will supervise the patrol vessels, with Shengshan as the base and the Junhe warship with Jiaoshan as the base, maintaining contact with each other for effective patrol.  Personnel will also be dispatched from the district headquarters to be responsible for supervision.  In order to facilitate identification and communication between the fishing protection teams and patrol vessels at sea, the district headquarters has formulated flag and light signals, which must be strictly followed.  After the fishing season ends, each fishing protection team should patrol the fishing areas they protect to ensure that there are no fishing boats before returning to their original defense positions.  The date of return must still be reported for verification.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Spring Flood Disasters Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>In the area along the Yangtze River including Nantong, Yaodong, and Langshan, due to changes in the river's course, the riverbank has collapsed severely.  Now, during the spring flood season, the tides are particularly high, further intensifying the erosion of the embankments.  Farmland is being submerged into the river, and the situation is becoming more severe.  This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "running erosion".  People in each polder fear that the embankments will collapse and the receding shoreline will also become dangerous, and that the tidal waters will flood inward, causing widespread disaster.  They are working day and night to rush to repair the embankments.</p>
<h3>Suicide of Detainee in Detention Center</h3>
<p>In cell number two of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau detention center, drug offender Ling Xuecong used a gauze bandage to wrap around his neck on the sleeping platform at night, inserted bamboo chopsticks, and twisted them forcefully, suffocating himself to death.  Administrator Wan Pengcheng reported the case to the court, and the prosecutor verified and interrogated.  The deaths Ling Xuecong, in the same cell has forty people, and can determine others had no reason to harm him, the Negligence of duty by Wan Pengcheng, should be subject to administrative punishment, non-prosecution will be imposed,</p>
<h3>Highway Worker Killed by Bandits in Hangzhou</h3>

However, Chen Qiliang, the station chief of the Liyun Road, was once kidnapped by bandits but fortunately escaped unharmed.  After receiving the report, the Highway Bureau, considering the tragic deaths of the employees in the line of duty, specially requested the Department of Construction to provide generous compensation to their families.</p>
<h3>Learning Problems (Part 1) - Dean of the Graduate School of Education, Central University - Ai Wei</h3>
<p>Learning problems fall within the scope of psychological research. Since psychology is the science of studying all activities—human and animal—and learning is a part of human and animal activities, learning problems should be researched based on psychology. Like other sciences, psychology has an important condition, which is the economic condition. Therefore, when discussing learning problems, we must pay attention to the economics of learning. In other words, we want to spend less time on various learning activities and achieve greater results. I understand that the listeners today are more than 200,000 middle school students from across the country. Middle school students are in their learning period, and they should pay attention to learning methods. Because if the method is chosen properly, the result will be twice the effort with half the work; otherwise, a lot of time will be wasted, and the effect will still be minimal. This is certainly uneconomical, unscientific, and unpsychological. Today, I will discuss learning methods based on psychology, hoping that you will do as I say. In this way, I can guarantee to you that you will inevitably spend less time and get better results in reading all books in the future.</p>
<p>What is learning? We don't need to explain it in detail, and we don't have time to make a detailed explanation. We may as well accept the general view of learning, but we must add one point: that is, learners must have a response when learning. For example, a teacher asks a child, "What is three plus four?" The child says, "Equals four." This answer is his reaction. Sometimes, learning is not yet mature, but he must also respond. If this response is correct, then his habit can be considered to have been formed. Therefore, learning is entirely a matter of habit formation. When we read a book, if we want to develop a solid habit, we must make active responses. Passive responses or just repeated practice are useless. Some people hold a book in their hands, their eyes looking at the book. To others, it seems like they are reading, but in reality, their response is passive. In other words, although their eyes are on the book, their minds are not there. Reading in this way, no matter how many times you read it, how many hours you spend, you still won't learn it. Therefore, when we read, we should read vigorously and pay special attention. People often say, "Anything that has turned around in our hearts, we can always remember easily." In fact, the so-called "turned around" means that it has caused an active reaction. In school, we always understand the subjects with experiments more clearly and remember them more clearly, which is nothing more than the result of active responses.</p>
<p>Below, I will discuss learning from three aspects: the relationship between learning and the body—especially physical fatigue; the relationship between learning and psychology—especially emotions; and the relationship between learning and daily life or habits.</p>
<p>Learning and Fatigue: If we read for too long without rest, we will feel physically and mentally fatigued. Regarding this issue, students can be divided into at least two types. One type of person works too hard, to the point of being physically and mentally exhausted without realizing it, and continues to read. The other type of person feels physically and mentally tired after reading very little, so they stop working, thinking that they can't continue reading, and that they will get sick if they read any further. Both of these types of people are either too much or not enough. As the saying goes, "Excess is as bad as deficiency," and both of these types of people have not considered the economics of learning. What we mean is that learning should be economical, and at the same time, the body and mind should be healthy. That is, we should maintain the health of our body and mind while reading, and at the same time, try our best to study, so as to achieve the most economical purpose. We know that the ability to read for a long time varies from person to person among students. Some people get tired after reading for a short time, but they recover easily. Some people don't feel tired until they have read for a long time, but it is not easy to recover. This all depends on the strength of each person's body and mind. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize in one or two sentences how much time one should work each day so as not to harm the body and mind. Even the so-called method of working eight hours, sleeping eight hours, and playing eight hours in a day and night is not the only good method. According to our research results: The number of hours of sleep is generally around eight hours, and there is not much difference between classmates. This is in general, as for special people, a different discussion is needed.</p>
<p>Thinking about our average middle school students, it seems that working eight hours a day is too little. If our body is not too weak, and at the same time, we do not feel particularly bored with family, school, or society, we can spend about twelve hours a day reading, but we should allocate these hours properly each day. For example, we should rest after reading for one or two hours. Such short-term rest, according to the results of psychological research, is very beneficial. Therefore, the method set by the school is to rest for five minutes or ten minutes after each lesson—preferably ten minutes. If students can use these ten minutes well, it will be very beneficial to their body and mind.</p>
<p>The second type of person is those who work for too long without realizing they are tired. These people seem to have not fulfilled the economic conditions of learning. In other words, their learning is unscientific or unpsychological. Because we not only want to do more work every day, but also want our working years to be long. Being too tired without realizing it will result in a health that cannot be recovered. If this situation persists, it will become chronic fatigue, which will lead to various mental illnesses. For example, in the United States during the time of President Lincoln, the Secretary of the Treasury, Chiltenden, continuously signed 115,000 banknotes in 72 hours, resulting in irreparable nerve damage. Also, a farmer with a mental illness came to a hospital in Boston one day. After the doctor investigated, he did not find any cases of mental illness in his family history. Further investigation into his personal life revealed that this person was a milk delivery man who got up at 2 a.m. every morning to work until 10 p.m. In addition, he was also engaged in farming. In this way, one person was doing the work of two or three people, without ever resting, so he was too tired, even to the point of madness. The doctor's treatment method was to let him rest, give him better food, and give him plenty of sleep. As a result, his illness actually improved within a year and a half.</p>
<p>Therefore, working for too long or being too tired is a very dangerous thing. If we want to know how to recover after being tired, there is a very simple test, which is whether your mind feels clear when you wake up in the morning after sleeping all night. If our mind is clear, it proves that our spirit has recovered. If our mind still feels unclear every morning, it proves that our spirit has not recovered. If this happens often, it is very dangerous.</p>

<p>Chen as Chairman: For today’s grand ceremony, Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan originally intended to come to Shanghai himself to participate. However, due to the Administrative Yuan meeting being held today, he specially appointed Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet stationed in Shanghai, as his representative to chair the event. This telegram order arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Largest in the Country: Yesterday, according to an announcement made by the shipyard authorities regarding the construction process and various preparations, the shipyard has been adding naval vessels in recent years, and the number of ships belonging to various agencies and companies has also increased. The repair work is becoming more and more frequent. The existing first and second docks are insufficient. If large ships of more than 10,000 tons are encountered, the two docks cannot accommodate them. Therefore, the plan to open the new No. 3 dock was made, and the address was transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ordnance Manufacturers in two phases. The first phase was to build a dock 375 feet long, 89 feet wide, and 26 feet deep. The project was contracted by the American World Industries Company and started in May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China and completed on October 10th of the 23rd year. Then the second phase of the project was continued, extending it to 645 feet. It has now been fully completed, and the dock opening ceremony will be held today. The materials used in the construction of this dock are the newest and most sturdy. The dock wall is built with double-layered steel sheet piles. There are ladders on both sides that lead directly to the bottom of the dock, and there is a ramp at the end for heavy machinery. The dock gate is also made of steel and has water tanks inside to manage the lifting and lowering of the gate. There are two pumps, each with 384 horsepower, 720 revolutions per minute, and 400 volts of electricity. New houses have also been built next to the dock, equipped with new facilities for the use of the crew of the ships entering the dock. All facilities are perfect and can be regarded as the best among the docks in the country.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industries Convened Shanghai Financial Community to Discuss Establishment of Agricultural Bank</h3>
<p>To Provide Agricultural Capital and Distribute Agricultural Products, the Government Allocated a Fixed Capital of 30 Million Yuan, Scheduled to be Formally Established in June of this Year</p>
<p>Industrial Minister Wu Dingchang, in order to thoroughly revitalize China's agriculture, specially created an Agricultural Bank to manage financial distribution and all cooperative undertakings. He specially invited the financial community at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Club yesterday at 5:00 PM to discuss methods of investing in rural areas and to discuss the general organizational outline. The financial community unanimously agreed and promised to cooperate. It is scheduled to be established in June of this year. Our New News Agency reporter filed the following detailed report.</p>
<p>List of Attendees</p>
<p>In addition to Industry Minister Wu Dingchang, those invited to participate yesterday included the leaders of major banks such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, China Industrial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Yanye Bank, Continental Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Silk Industry Bank, National Products Bank, Bank of Communications and Commerce, Zhongfu Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, China Farmers' Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Reclamation Bank, Encouragement Bank, Siming Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Jiangsu Zhejiang Bank, East Asia Bank, Donglai Bank, Guohua Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Xinhua Bank, Agricultural and Commercial Bank, and Overseas Chinese Bank: Song Hanzhang, Xi Dejun, Hu Meian, Tang Shoumin, Zhang Peishen, Xu Xinliu, Yang Jiezhen, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunqi, Ye Fuzhi, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Qi Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Li Zhisun, Qu Jigang, Wang Zhixin, Shen Shuyu, Qian Xinzhi, Sun Jingxi, Wang Shaoyi, Lin Bingwen, Quan Runsheng, Song Ziliang, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Report by the Industry Minister</p>
<p>Minister Wu Dingchang reported on the purpose of establishing the Agricultural Bank, stating that the bankruptcy of China's rural areas is undeniable. Although a portion of the banking community has handled rural loans and cooperatives to engage in relief efforts over the years, I believe that revitalizing agriculture is a matter of urgency. However, regarding the allocation, transportation, and all cooperative undertakings, it is necessary to establish a unified agency and implement a whole plan. Therefore, it is planned to establish an Agricultural Bank, organized through public-private cooperation. Its funds are divided into two types: fixed and circulating. The fixed capital is set at 30 million yuan, which will be allocated by the government at 6 million yuan each year, totaling 30 million yuan in five years. The amount of circulating funds will be decided by the directors elected by the banking community, according to the nature and term of the investment undertaking, and will be negotiated with the public and private banks that join. A general outline of the organization of the Agricultural Bank has now been drafted, and I have specially invited you to come here to study it in detail and jointly plan the progress.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>After the report from the Ministry of Industry, the general outline of the organization of the Agricultural Bank was read out item by item and explained in detail. Then Lin Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zhixin, Zhou Zuomin, and others stood up one after another to express their opinions. They all agreed to the establishment of the Agricultural Bank and agreed to the joint management by the government and businesses. However, regarding the circulating funds, they advocated issuing a type of agricultural note similar to commercial paper. At the same time, regarding the investment direction, the management of rural cooperatives, and the establishment of warehouses and other measures, they hoped that after detailed study based on the organizational outline, further decisions would be made. Minister Wu replied, stating that the opinions expressed by everyone were quite practical. Please submit any supplementary opinions on the organizational outline in writing to the ministry for compilation before May 15, and then a second meeting will be convened to discuss and decide on further steps. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock. After the meeting, Minister Wu said that the Agricultural Bank is now starting preparations and is scheduled to be formally established in June of this year. I will take the night train back to Beijing tonight (last night).</p>
<p>Organizational Outline</p>
<p>The organizational outline of the Agricultural Bank: The purpose of the Agricultural Bank is to provide agricultural capital and distribute agricultural products. The Agricultural Bank will not be a purely state-owned enterprise or a private enterprise, but a public-private partnership established by law by the government. The Agricultural Bank will be governed by a board of directors, consisting of six directors appointed by the government and six directors elected by the participating public and private banks. The government will appoint a president and one or two vice presidents (the titles are subject to negotiation) from the directors to manage the bank's affairs. Branches may be established in various provinces, and commissioners may be appointed in counties. The funds of the Agricultural Bank are divided into two types: fixed funds and circulating funds. The fixed funds are 30 million yuan (to be provided by the government with 6 million yuan allocated each year, totaling 30 million yuan in five years). The circulating funds have no fixed amount and will be determined by the directors elected by the banking community according to the nature and term of the investment undertakings, and will be negotiated with the participating public and private banks. When necessary, the government may order the Agricultural Bank to issue agricultural bonds, with the government being responsible for guaranteeing the principal and interest. The Agricultural Bank's affairs are divided into two departments: the Agricultural Capital Department and the Agricultural Products Department. The Agricultural Capital Department handles the following matters: For agricultural banks, cooperatives, or peasant pawnshops that plan to be established in counties and rural areas, the Agricultural Capital Department may, upon approval, withdraw funds from the fixed capital, ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan, to invest in and promote them, and will be responsible for supervision and inspection. However, this investment may not use the circulating funds. The mortgages obtained by agricultural banks, cooperatives, or peasant pawnshops in counties and rural areas from loans may be re-mortgaged to the Agricultural Capital Department. The Agricultural Capital Department will examine the nature of the mortgages and, with the consent of the directors from the banking community, may borrow circulating funds. The Agricultural Capital Department may, with the permission of the board of directors, stipulate an amount and negotiate with agricultural banks or cooperatives in various counties and rural areas to make some credit loans to farmers when necessary. The Agricultural Capital Department, after the examination and approval of the board of directors, may also allocate funds for improving agricultural products. Both of these funds may also use the circulating funds with the consent of the banking community. The Agricultural Capital Department may not make direct loans except with special permission. The interest rate on loans from the Agricultural Capital Department should be determined by the board of directors according to local customs, and a certain amount may be withdrawn as a reserve fund. When the Agricultural Capital Department has losses on loans, the reserve fund may be used to compensate for them first. The Agricultural Products Department handles the following matters: Disposition of agricultural products in the Agricultural Capital Department's mortgages, general sales of agricultural products, may be entrusted by farmers and merchants to handle the adjustment of agricultural products, may plan the business of agricultural products warehouses in important locations and lease them at low prices. The funds needed by the Agricultural Products Department may be borrowed from circulating funds through mortgage or remittance methods. The regulations of the government-operated railways and ships regarding agricultural product freight rates must solicit the opinion of the president of the Agricultural Bank. If there is any objection, the government may be requested to send personnel to adjudicate. The Agricultural Bank may examine and approve the agricultural areas of each province and divide them into five zones according to production and transportation conditions. The first zone will be managed in the first year, the second zone in the second year, and the organization will be completed in five years in order. The government is responsible for the profits and losses of the Agricultural Bank. If there is a deficit in the annual settlement, the government will immediately make up for the deficit amount. Under no circumstances should the circulating funds be endangered.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Goes to Nanjing, Xu Chongzhi Hosts a Dinner Tonight</h3>
<p>According to early reports, Mr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, suffered from a nasal ailment. After receiving treatment in Shanghai, he has recovered. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing next week to continue discussing the issue of unity. Mr. Xu Chongzhi, the vice president of the Supervisory Yuan, will host a dinner for Mr. Wang tonight, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Going to Nanjing Next Week</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing, Mr. Wang recuperated at Mr. Hu's residence on Gaoen Road. After receiving treatment from nasal specialists, he has fully recovered. In recent days, he has been in good spirits, discussing the current situation with Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Xu Chongzhi, and others. Because President Chiang has already left Nanjing for Wuhan and is moving on to Sichuan, there are no immediate plans to go to Nanjing. However, it is expected that Mr. Wang will go to Nanjing next week to continue discussing the issue of unity. Wei Daoming will accompany Mr. Wang to Nanjing at that time, it is said.</p>
<p>Xu's Dinner</p>
<p>Since arriving from Hong Kong, Mr. Wang has declined all social engagements due to illness and busy travel. It is now known that Mr. Xu Chongzhi, the vice president of the Supervisory Yuan, has scheduled a dinner for Mr. Wang at his private residence on Seymour Road at 6:30 PM today. He has also invited Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, Yu Youren, the president of the Supervisory Yuan, Song Ziwen, the standing committee member of the National Economic Council, and Wu Tiecheng, the mayor, among other central figures in Shanghai, more than twenty people will be in attendance, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhisheng Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Wang Discusses the Construction Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, Planning to Establish the Industrial Union's Guangdong and Guangxi Branch</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhisheng, Secretary-General of the China General Federation of Industries and Secretary-General of the Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Group, went to Guangdong and Guangxi for inspection and to prepare for the establishment of the Guangdong and Guangxi branches. Having completed his work, he returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 13th aboard the President McKinley. Representatives from the China General Federation of Industries, the National Federation of Commerce, the Association of Mechanical Industries, and other organizations in Shanghai went to welcome him. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Planning to Establish the Industrial Union Branch</p>
<p>Mr. Wang told reporters that after completing the inspection with the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group, he stayed in Guangdong to discuss the establishment of the Guangdong and Guangxi branches of the Industrial Union. He successively visited Commanders-in-Chief Chen and Li, Provincial Chairman Lin, Mayor Liu, Director He, Director Feng, and others, all of whom expressed strong agreement. An initial plan has been discussed to establish branches in Guangzhou and Nanning to facilitate communication and liaison between Shanghai and the industrial and commercial sectors of Guangdong and Guangxi. Then, investments and developments will be planned. If necessary, offices will be established in Hong Kong and Wuzhou. After returning to Shanghai, he will meet with Mr. Cheng Xu at once to discuss the matter, and then implementation can begin directly.</p>
<p>Construction Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>When asked about the construction situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, he stated that the work of the Provincial Special Products Management Office, run by the Guangdong Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and the Statistics Bureau is adding color and meeting the needs of the times. In particular, the establishment of sugar factories occupies an important position. If it can be promoted, it can naturally curb the sales of foreign sugar. In addition, although light industry and the chemical industry are in their infancy, they are still working hard. Guangxi has abundant natural resources, such as tung oil, livestock, and minerals, which are gifts from nature. In the future, it can provide raw materials for Shanghai manufacturers. In particular, the province's practice of incorporating soldiers into agricultural groups, education, and recruitment is quite worthy of emulation, he said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City Implements a General Inspection of Opium Suppression, Establishes Propaganda Teams to Promote Door-to-Door in Different Areas, Commissioner Ma Inspects Opium Suppression Work in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Opium Suppression Committee and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to promote the registration of opium smokers throughout the city, will conduct a general inspection starting on the 13th. Furthermore, starting on the 13th, propaganda teams will be organized to awaken unregistered opium smokers in the urban area and to urge them to voluntarily register with the authorities from April 1st to the end of the month. Opium smokers who have already registered should also renew their permits with the authorities. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Commissioner Ma Inspects Opium Suppression in Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to supervise the strict implementation of opium suppression work in various provinces and cities, the General Opium Suppression Headquarters has specially sent Ma Liang, Commissioner for Opium Suppression Inspection in Jiangsu and Shanghai, to Shanghai first. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Ma will join the Shanghai Municipal Opium Suppression Committee and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inspect the implementation of opium suppression work in Shanghai. Mr. Ma will take turns inspecting in Jiangsu and Shanghai, and if there are any areas where the implementation is not perfect, he will report them at any time to seek improvement.</p>
<p>Propaganda Teams Set Out to Promote</p>
<p>On the Shanghai side, in order to renew the limited-time opium cessation permits for the second term, the period has expired. And, since it is feared that there may still be opium smokers in Shanghai who have not obtained opium permits from the authorities, propaganda teams have been organized starting on the 13th to conduct propaganda in various districts on a door-to-door basis, awakening unregistered opium smokers and urging them to register with the authorities to obtain permits. Those who have already obtained permits should still renew their permits with the authorities in order to comply with the law. The departure of these propaganda teams will last for about a week, organized by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Opium Suppression Committee, taking turns to conduct propaganda in various districts, so that opium smokers in general can understand the strictness of the authorities' implementation of opium suppression laws and avoid any further evasion.</p>
<p>The Committee and Bureau Advise All Opium Smokers in the City</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Opium Suppression Committee and the Public Security Bureau issued a notice to opium smokers regarding the renewal of the limited-time opium cessation permits for the second term, saying: The Bureau has decided that from April 1st to May 31st of this year, the period for opium smokers in Shanghai to renew their limited-time opium cessation permits for the second term. The procedures for renewing permits have been set out in great detail and published in newspapers, and have also been repeatedly broadcast and lectured on, so I think everyone understands them very well. But what is the meaning of opium smokers registering and renewing their permits? I am afraid that most opium smokers still do not fully understand. Now, I will explain the methods and meaning in detail again. The Bureau is implementing opium suppression in Shanghai in accordance with the central government's prohibition order, implementing a method of gradual reduction by year and a time limit for complete cessation. From July to December of the 24th year, it was the period for carrying out opium smoker registration. All opium smokers registered during this period are limited to completely ceasing by the end of the 29th year. Limited-time opium cessation permits are issued once, and in each permit renewal period, the amount smoked is gradually reduced according to the depth of the registered opium smoker's addiction, age, until it is reduced to the lowest level, and then an order is issued to stop completely. If an opium smoker voluntarily quits and reports to the Bureau and it is verified to be true, then he can apply to cancel the opium cessation permit previously obtained, and there is no need to renew it again. In the past, there were about 35,000 opium smokers who registered and obtained permits and were sent for opium cessation treatment. However, given the vastness of Shanghai's jurisdiction and the large number of opium smokers, the number of those who have failed to register and obtain permits is certainly not small. Therefore, the Bureau intends to carry out a self-renewal inspection and supplementary registration in the shortest possible time, without leaving out a single one. Before the self-renewal inspection work is completed, the method of opium smokers purchasing raw opium based on their permits cannot be implemented. Therefore, the amount smoked by opium smokers renewing permits in this period will not be reduced. As for the fee for renewing permits, the Bureau has adopted the principle of not increasing the burden on opium smokers. The fee for ordinary permits is still five yuan, and the fee for poor people's permits is still six jiao. It can be said that they have a deep understanding of the already registered opium smokers and are very considerate. Those who cannot quit automatically and immediately should register opium smokers and renew their permits in stages. This is an important step stipulated and implemented by the opium suppression laws and regulations, and no leniency is allowed. If you try to avoid paying the fee and do not come to renew your permit in accordance with the regulations, then you are violating the law. After the prescribed permit renewal period, if an opium smoker neither renews his permit nor applies for opium cessation, or declares that he will quit, the Bureau will consider him to be smoking privately without a permit and will immediately investigate and summon him to the Bureau and send him to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for legal action. It is hoped that opium smokers in general should pay special attention and not knowingly break the law. As for opium smokers who privately open opium dens and use their own permits to provide opium for others to smoke, they should wake up early. Because the meaning of the Bureau issuing permits is to be considerate of elderly opium smokers with severe addictions who cannot quit immediately, and to enable them to gradually quit. After a permit is issued, his smoking is guaranteed by the government and the law. If he uses his permit to open an opium den and provide opium for others to smoke, or gives his permit to others to use, then he is violating criminal law and will be subject to legal sanctions. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters will punish those who intend to profit and provide opium for people to smoke in their premises in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Opium Suppression Crimes. The lighter sentences are more than five years of imprisonment, and the heavier sentences are life imprisonment. Opium smokers should understand the strictness of the laws and regulations and be cautious and avoid testing the law. This is what the Committee and Bureau most hope for.</p>
<p>Notice of Renewal of Permits for the Second Term</p>
<p>Notice on the Renewal of Limited-Time Opium Cessation Permits for the Second Term: The renewal registration date for the second term is from April 1st to May 31st of this year. Those who fail to register after the deadline will have their first-term permits invalidated. With the Bureau's approval, the burden on opium smokers will not be increased. The fee for renewing ordinary limited-time opium cessation permits is still five yuan, and the fee for renewing limited-time opium cessation permits for the poor is still six jiao. Opium smokers should bring their first-term permits to the local bureau or team in charge during the permit renewal registration period to present for verification and apply for registration, and report their clear name, age, place of origin, occupation, address, and other items. After the bureau or team handling the permit renewal has verified and registered, they will affix a chop with the words "Temporary Second-Term Permit" on the first-term permit and return it for temporary use. Opium smokers who have registered for permit renewal must, within one month but after half a month of registration, bring their first-term permits to the bureau or team handling the permit renewal to renew their second-term permits. Opium smokers from the Special District who come to register must report their mailing address in the city. If their mailing address is within the jurisdiction of a certain bureau or team, they should go to that bureau or team to apply for registration. If they apply across the border, the bureau or team handling the permit renewal may refuse their registration. If an opium smoker holds a receipt issued by the first-term registration office, he must first go to the original registration bureau or team to renew his first-term permit, and then apply for permit renewal registration according to the procedures based on that permit.</p>

<h3>Chinese Ratepayers' Association Will Hold a Representative Congress Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Electing Five Chinese Directors and Six Committee Members, Resolved to Propose Discussion on the New Telephone Regulations</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association Elected a Total of 81 Representatives From Three Groups of Individuals, Fellow Villagers, and Commerce in the Fifteenth Session, It Is Scheduled to Hold a Representative Congress at the Banking Club at 59 Hong Kong Road at 2:00 PM Tomorrow. In Addition to Electing Five Chinese Directors, Six Chinese Committee Members, One Land Committee Member, and Twenty-Seven Executive Committee Members, A Resolution to Propose Discussion on the New Telephone Fee Regulations Will Be Made, Arguing That Regardless of Household or Commercial Use, the Basic Fixed Number Should Be Cancelled, and Each Call Should Be Calculated at a Uniform Rate of Three Cents. At That Time, In Addition to Inviting the Previous Session's Chinese Directors and Committee Members Such as Yu Qiaqing to Attend and Report, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Party Department Will Be Invited to Send Personnel for Guidance, and the Association's Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Who Went to Ningbo a Few Days Ago Due to Business, Is Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Today to Preside Over the Meeting, It Is Said.</p>
<h3>Special District Municipal Federation's Sincere Admonition to Representatives on Careful Election</h3>
<p>For Chinese Directors and Committee Members, They Must Be Those Who Are Trusted by the Public, and Must Study International Languages in Order to Develop Themselves According to the Shenshi News Agency, The First Special District Citizens' Federation Yesterday Sent Letters to the 81 Elected Representatives of the 15th Session of the Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association, Respectfully Advising Them to Be Cautious About the Election of Chinese Directors and Committee Members and Executive Committee Members, in Order to Live Up to the Expectations of the Citizens. The Original Letter Said: Since the May Fourth Movement, We Have Seen That the National Affairs Are in Chaos. If We Continue to Live in a Drunken Dream and Do Not Rise Up to Strive for Strength, We Will Inevitably Become Meat on a Cutting Board, Subject to Being Slaughtered. The Disaster Will Be Unimaginable. Therefore, We Citizens of the Shanghai Special District Demand to Participate in the Concession Administrative Organization. The Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association Elects Representatives to Produce Chinese Directors and Committee Members to Participate in the Municipal Council's Administration, Seek Welfare for the Citizens, and Fight for Rights for the Country. The Election Is Held Once a Year, and This Is the Fifteenth Session. We Have Repeatedly Strived to the Municipal Council to Generate Chinese and Western Directors in Proportion to Taxation. Up to Now, We Have Obtained Five Chinese Directors and Six Chinese Committee Members. Although It Cannot Fully Live Up to the Expectations of the Citizens, It Is Somewhat Gratifying. However, the Responsibility of the Representatives Participating in the Citizens Is Very Important, Relating to the Interests of the Entire Citizens. Dealing With Foreigners Is Difficult Without Being Proficient in International Languages. Checking the Successive Committee Members Who Have Attended, Although They Have Not Been Able to Fully Live Up to the Expectations of the Public, They Have Been Able to Fulfill Their Responsibilities. Unfortunately, Last Year, Due to the Encirclement of Special Forces, the Elected Representatives and the Directors and Committee Members Attending the Municipal Affairs Had a Majority Who Did Not Study International Languages. They Were Merely Filling a Position, So It Is No Wonder That They Were Like Mutes on the Venue's Podium, Unable to Utter a Word to Represent the Citizens' Intentions. Therefore, the Citizens of the Special District Have Been Frequently Infringed Upon by External Forces Every Year, Such As the Unreasonable Increase in Telephone Prices, Which Is Just One Aspect. Every Time We Think of This, We Feel Pain and Grief. Now, the Election of Chinese Directors and Committee Members in This Session Has Been Scheduled to Be Held at the Representative Congress on April 15th, Beginning the Election. The Federation Represents the Public Opinion of 1.5 Million Citizens in the Special District and Has the Following Requirements. Please Pay Special Attention to the Representatives of Each Group: When Electing Directors, They Must Be Trusted by the Public. They Must Have a Foundation in International Languages. They Must Be Brave to Take Responsibility and Be Absolutely Responsible. The Above Three Points Are the Minimum Requirements for Being a Chinese Director and Committee Member. If So, Then They Can Develop Their Opinions on the Conference Table and Fight for the Welfare of the Citizens. As for the Executive Committee Members of the Ratepayers' Association, Although Their Responsibilities Are Not As Great As Those of the Chinese Directors and Committee Members, the Promotion of Association Affairs and the Welfare of the Citizens Also Rely on the Executive Committee Members' Planning and Assistance to Achieve Success. Therefore, They Must Also Have Considerable Knowledge and Personality to Be Qualified for the Position. As for the Scum of the Nation and Vermin of Society, As Well As Active-Duty Military Personnel and Those Who Have Been Subject to Disciplinary Punishment by Party and Government Agencies, Such People Are Certainly Not Representatives of Genuine Public Opinion, and It Is Obvious That They Should Not Be Allowed to Mix In and Destroy the Reputation of the Entire Association. It Is Our Sincere Hope That All Citizens in the Special District, As Well As Party and Government Agencies, Will Pay Serious Attention to This and Prevent It. We Hope That the Representatives Will Forgive Our Superficial Views.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River Ship Stopped at Jiangyin Due to Obstruction</h3>
<p>The Kai Luan Wharf Does Not Allow Borrowing</p>
<p>In Response to the Request of the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce and Various Sectors, The State-Run China Merchants Bureau Decided That Starting This Month, All Yangtze River Ships Going to Hankou From the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Will No Longer Anchor in the Middle of the River When Passing Through Jiangyin, But Will Change to Berth at the Wharf to Facilitate Passengers Getting on and off and to Facilitate Loading Goods. The Wharf Has Designated the Jiangyin Wharf of the Kai Luan Coal Mining Company As the Berthing Place for China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River Ships. The Bureau Has Ordered Various Yangtze River Ships to Comply and Has Telegraphed the Cheng Chamber of Commerce That It Has Been Implemented. However, This Matter Has Encountered Obstruction at the Moment. When China Merchants Bureau's Jiangjing and Jiangda Ships Arrived in Cheng and Wanted to Berth at the Kai Luan Wharf, They Were Rejected by the Wharf's Administrator, Who Did Not Allow Them to Berth. The Reason Was That the China Merchants Bureau Had Not Contacted Kai Luan in Advance, Nor Had It Signed a Berthing Agreement, So It Was Really Difficult to Allow It. As a Result, Various Yangtze River Ships Arrived and Then Anchored in the Middle of the River. The Refusal of the Kai Luan Jiangyin Wharf to Allow Berthing Has Been Formally Notified to the Bureau. Now the Bureau Is Inspecting the Previous Telegrams From Various Circles in Jiangyin Requesting the Berthing of Ships, Which Mentioned That the Leasing Procedures for the Kai Luan Wharf Were Handled by the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce and That the China Merchants Bureau Did Not Need to Intervene in Anything. Therefore, Cai Zengji Has Telegraphed the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce, Instructing Them to Complete the Procedures With the Kai Luan Wharf As Soon As Possible to Avoid Delaying the Operation of the Ships.</p>

School groups included more than 3,500 students from schools such as Minli, Zhonghua, Vocational, Kunfan, Guoguang, and Mingde. There were also several groups from the Public Utilities Bureau and other organizations. Since both the museum and the Aviation Association are the newest large buildings in the city, and the weather was sunny and the spring scenery intoxicating, visitors not only found the exhibits inside the museum beautiful, but also lingered outside, reluctant to leave. The new urban area became a bustling place, with pedestrians lining the asphalt roads.

<h3>Human-Powered Vehicle Association Requests Correction of Quota for Registered Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>Vehicle Committee to Begin Supplementary Registration Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the issue of registration for rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai International Settlement has been unanimously requested by vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers and has been approved by the Public Works Department. The registration of rickshaw pullers will continue today at Macgen Road, New Bridge, and Shunde Road. However, the Vehicle Committee recently issued a notice stating that registration will be limited to one person introduced by two vehicles, with a total of 5,000 people registered. Vehicle owners and rickshaw pullers believe that the quota is too small and insufficient for distribution, and have unanimously expressed their opposition. Yesterday, the Vehicle Owners' Association sent letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various hometown associations, and the Citizens' Federation, requesting assistance. The original text is excerpted below: "To whom it may concern, there are 10,000 rickshaws in the International Settlement, with a total of 70,000 to 80,000 rickshaw pullers. Since the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee implemented rickshaw puller registration the year before last, a total of more than 41,000 people have been approved for registration. The remaining rickshaw pullers, because they returned to their hometowns to farm and occasionally lost the opportunity to register, cannot pull rickshaws and are unemployed, numbering as many as 20,000 to 30,000. The plight of their families, numbering several people each, crying for hunger and cold, is unbearable to witness. Our association has been heartbroken and has repeatedly requested the Public Works Department to relieve unemployed rickshaw pullers and continue to register them. After several efforts and appeals, as a result of arguing on the basis of reason, the Public Works Department agreed to take over the Vehicle Committee from April 14th and continue to carry out rickshaw puller registration. Unexpectedly, the Vehicle Committee issued a notice stating that registration will be limited to one person introduced by two vehicles, with a total quota of 5,000 people. According to reports from vehicle owners, there are at least more than 20,000 rickshaw pullers who were originally pulling rickshaws but are now unemployed due to not being registered. Such a small amount of porridge for so many monks will still not be enough to distribute. Our association believes that this repeated restriction on rickshaw puller registration by the Vehicle Committee is tantamount to cutting off the livelihoods of the poor and increasing the number of unemployed people in society. For the sake of rickshaw pullers' livelihoods and social order, it is necessary to correct this. We have always admired your association's concern for the livelihoods of the poor and the maintenance of social justice, and we have always been enthusiastic. Accordingly, we request that you take this into consideration and, out of concern for the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, please forward our request to the Public Works Department to correct the Vehicle Committee's quota method and implement unlimited rickshaw puller registration to benefit the poor and benefit society. We are infinitely hopeful."</p>

<h3>Hai Shun Steamer Enters Port and Damages East Railway Dock</h3>
<p>Caused by Avoiding Ferry Boat, Personnel to be Sent for Inspection Today</p>
<p>The Hai Shun, a steamer of the Shanghai Haichang Shipping Company, came from Yingkou to Shanghai. After the ship arrived in the Huangpu River, it collided with the dock and then with a barge, causing considerable damage, in order to avoid a ferry boat. The following is a report from our reporter on the situation obtained from various sources:</p>
<p>Importing Goods: The Hai Shun steamer weighs 1,744 tons, is 285 feet 4 inches long, 34 feet 2 inches wide, 0.2 feet 4 inches deep, and has a draft of 17 feet 5 inches. It was built in Germany in 1897 and can travel 10 nautical miles per hour. It usually runs the Shanghai-Beiyang route. This time, the ship transported goods from Niuzhuang and Longkou to Shanghai. At 7:15 AM the day before yesterday, the ship entered Wusong. Before reaching the Yangjiabo dock after passing the East Railway dock, it collided violently with the East Railway dock in order to avoid a ferry boat and a small steam launch.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Ferry Boat: When the Hai Shun steamer was moving towards the Yangjiadu dock, a small steam launch named "Han" suddenly came from Pudong, towing a ferry boat with nearly a hundred passengers, and sailed from Pudong to Puxi. At this time, the Hai Shun steamer was moving quite fast. Suddenly, a ferry boat crossed in front of it, and the situation was very dangerous. If they collided, all the passengers on board would fall into the water and a major tragedy would occur. If the Hai Shun reversed, it would be too late. The captain of the Hai Shun had to choose the lesser of two evils and steer to the left. Unexpectedly, it collided with the dock.</p>
<p>Dock Damaged: The East Railway dock is below the Yangjiadu dock. The foremost is the Okura dock. The Hai Shun turned to the left and retreated slightly to avoid the John steam launch and the ferry boat. It happened to be in front of the East Railway dock, so the ship collided violently with the East Railway dock. (The ferry boat was saved.) The East Railway dock was hit, and because the Hai Shun steamer was heavily loaded, the damage was quite significant. Two barges loaded with goods were also moored outside the dock and were also hit violently by the Hai Shun steamer. Both barges were damaged. After the accident, in addition to the shipowner and the dock manager inspecting the damage, the Hai Shun steamer still opened the Okura dock to unload the goods.</p>
<p>Inspection Today: Because it was a customs closure the day before yesterday, the shipowner reported the cause and process of the incident to Haichang Company yesterday. Haichang Company also sent personnel to the ship for inquiries and inspected the dock. According to the shipowner's report, they transferred it to the Customs and the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and notified the insurance company to send ship inspectors and engineers today to inspect the damaged dock and barges, and estimate the loss in order to proceed with negotiations and repairs. Although the Hai Shun caused the accident, it did not hit the ferry boat, which was also a great fortune in the midst of misfortune.</p>
<h3>Case of Tan Zhuohong and Others for Dereliction of Duty to be Heard in Suzhou Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Suzhou Telephone: The case of Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai District Court, and Yang Shaopeng, a Shanghai lawyer, for dereliction of duty and fraud, was previously transferred to the Suzhou District Court, and the prosecutor Zhu Shufen filed a public prosecution. Now, Yuzhong, the head of the criminal court, has set the date for a hearing at 2:00 PM on April 25th. It is said that Tan Zhuohong has hired a Mr. Wu to prepare to appear in court for defense at that time.</p>
<h3>Wu Shizhong Distributes Strange Leaflets to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>The Text is Peculiar and Unintelligible, Coercing Vendors to Buy and Being Detained</p>
<p>Wu Shizhong, a native of Jinhua Lanxi, is 21 years old and works as a tailor. Because his income was not good, he changed his profession to sand turning and worked in the Qian Wanxing Sand Turning Workshop at No. 259 Tongzhou Road. However, the workshop recently closed down, so Wu also lost his job. The owner of the workshop, seeing that he had nowhere to go, temporarily allowed him to live there. Unexpectedly, Wu, in extreme poverty, had a change of heart and suddenly had a fanciful idea. He privately went to a printing shop on Wuzhou Road to print business cards and leaflets, and solicited money from shops and vendors on various roads, claiming that if they obtained these leaflets, they must be preserved. When he officially took office, he could use this list to work in a large factory. Therefore, many ignorant vendors were deceived by his trick. The day before yesterday, Wu again held the same leaflets and other items and distributed them among various shops and vendors in the Bazilu area, asking for two copper coins for each sheet, but they were not accepted. Wu then forced vendors to buy them, which caused conflicts between the two parties. A nearby guard caught sight of this, stepped forward to inquire, and learned the whole story. He also found more than 20 leaflets and business cards on Wu's body, as well as 30 to 40 copper coins obtained through fraud. He was immediately taken to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, he admitted everything and showed no signs of mental disorder. He was temporarily detained and will be sent to the court for interrogation. The business card was printed with "Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, Gambling Ban, Wu Shizhong, Wine, Cigarette Deposit," and the leaflets he issued were printed with "National Universal Big and Small Zha Wen," "Universal Police Meaning Universal Silver Medal," "Sent Eight Prefectures Fifteen Du Wu Liang City Outer Kou Village Wu Shizhong Jing Gui Ji Zhong," "Nine Generals National Great Manufacturing Factory," "Ordinary People's Big Exam Qualification Can Do Work," "Year 25," "One Yuan Per Household," "Year 27 Municipal Survey Establishment," "Civil Official Wang Chonghui," "Minister Jiang Jieda," "Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance Wu Shizhong Gambling Ban Wine Cigarette Deposit," etc. What these mean is really incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>Kuang Zhongmou and His Wife Involved in Litigation, Court Complains Greatly</h3>
<p>His Wife Firmly Demanding More Than 30,000 Yuan in Savings, Judge Bittersweetly劝双方和解</p>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou, the 60-year-old owner of the Penglai Market and a wealthy merchant from Liangxi, was sued by his wife Kuang Huiyueying (49 years old, a native of Shanghai) in the Shanghai District Court two years ago for Kuang Zhongmou's failure to handle savings. It was ruled that Kuang should return more than 37,000 yuan to his wife. After three trials, the case has been executed. However, Kuang Zhongmou was still unwilling and recently hired two lawyers, Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun, to file a lawsuit against his wife regarding the already executed case, requesting a objection and suspension of execution for a retrial. Yesterday, Judge Han Zuoti held a hearing. After Kuang Zhongmou appeared in court and stated his age and origin, the judge said, "Why must you two spouses compete and win? There is nothing to be gained by losing face." Kuang said, "I owe 570,000 yuan, and the annual interest is more than 50,000 yuan, while my income is only more than 20,000 yuan. I considered bankruptcy, but due to the advice of my two sons, I endured the pain and promised to give my descendants a foothold in society. Therefore, I acknowledged her more than 37,000 yuan and was willing to give a house, but it must be under my control. After I pass away, the property will belong to her." At this point, Kuang's wife's lawyer Yu Chengxiu stood up and said, "This case has already been concluded after three trials, and there is no possibility of change. Now, a retrial is being sought through objection, which is inappropriate. It should be rejected according to law." The judge said, "Kuang's business failure is a fact. Reconciliation is always the best solution." Lawyer Yu replied, "The plaintiff called and said that it would be better to divorce, but my client cannot agree to this." At this point, Kuang Zhongmou spoke loudly and said, "On December 24th of the 15th year of the Republic of China, she went to my company and took away my document box, such as the seals. Although they were returned, some items were not returned, including a folder and a draft of a will, which were not returned. She used this to initiate litigation. Last year, a reconciliation was reached at the Yizhixiang Restaurant, and I was willing to give each of my two sons and wife 100 yuan each, but she was unwilling. All kinds of things are contrary to ethics. Who in the world does not love his wife? But my environment... if someone else were in my situation, who knows what would happen." He vented his grievances and expressed his full of hidden pain. The judge then instructed the two lawyers to go out and reconcile first, and the case was adjourned for retrial.</p>
<h3>Opium Discovered in Wheat Field at Wusong Fort Taiwan, Seven Flour Bags of Raw Materials for Red Pills, Suspects Fled Upon Hearing the News, Two Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>In the wheat field rented by Liu Qijin, a native of Siyang south of the Wusong Fort Taiwan Seaport Quarantine Station, seven bags of white powder were suddenly discovered the day before yesterday. The white powder is the raw material for manufacturing red pill drugs. After the Wusong Police Station investigated and seized the powder, patrol captain Zheng Bibo and detective Chen Hongsheng successively arrested the tenant Liu Qijin and suspects Wang Tongquan and Chen Baolin (all natives of Jiangbei) in the vicinity, totaling three people. They confessed that there were still five bags in a thatched house of a certain Wu family at the northern end of the fort, which had been taken away a few days ago. They immediately rushed to arrest them, but the suspects had already fled upon hearing the news. The three suspects who were arrested, along with the drugs, have been sent to the General Bureau and transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation and prosecution, and the escaped suspects are being strictly pursued.</p>
<h3>Kuang Zhongmou's Daughter-in-Law Accused of Fraud Again</h3>
<p>Accused of Fraudulently Obtaining Gold Jewelry with Her Mother, Ms. Cheng Xu</p>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market, has been facing misfortunes and disturbances in recent years. His daughter-in-law, Kuang Chen, and her mother, Cheng Xu, were previously sued in the District Court by Yin Cunfu, the former Director of the Changshu Public Security Bureau, for fraudulently obtaining diamond rings. The court sentenced Cheng Xu to two years in prison and Kuang Chen to a fine of 400 yuan. After a recent appeal, Cheng Xu's sentence was reduced to one year in prison, and Kuang Chen was found not guilty. However, just as one wave subsided, another arose. Now, a local woman, Gu Jin, has filed a self-accusation in the District Court, accusing the mother and daughter of fraudulently obtaining as many as 29 pieces of gold jewelry using similar methods, and requesting an investigation. Kuang Chen was summoned but did not appear, and the court ordered her arrest. The day before yesterday, the plaintiff Gu Jin twisted Kuang Chen to the court and ordered her to be released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Lu continued the hearing. The plaintiff did not appear. The judge questioned Cheng Xu and Kuang Chen, who were in custody, and ordered them to be remanded for further questioning. Cheng Xu was returned to custody, and Kuang Chen was still released on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhu Honglie Detained After Appearing in Court</h3>
<p>Due to a Sixty-Yuan Check, Sent to the Third Branch of the High Court</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Honglie, courtesy name Tanru, is a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu. In March of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he joined the Shanghai Lawyers' Association and practiced law in Shanghai. His office is located at No. 528 in the China Exchange Building. However, in recent years, the number of lawyers in Shanghai has increased like bamboo shoots after rain, and the market has been depressed, so the legal profession has also plummeted, and all industries have reported a recession. Lawyer Zhu is one of them, so he was fined 60 yuan by the Third Branch of the High Court in the French Concession of Shanghai for issuing a dishonored check. Lawyer Zhu was unable to pay this small amount, so the Third Branch of the High Court sent a letter to various courts in Shanghai, requesting that if they encountered Lawyer Zhu Honglie appearing in court to represent a case, they should detain him. Yesterday afternoon, Lawyer Zhu appeared in court to defend in the case of Jin Dayun suing Yu Chunxiang for fraud. Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court and, upon seeing Lawyer Zhu, immediately announced that the case would be adjourned for hearing. He then ordered the judicial police to take Zhu Honglie to the defendant's waiting room for detention, and then telephoned the Third Branch of the High Court to take him away for custody.</p>
<h3>Hua Ji Road: Drug Den Busted</h3>
<p>Korean Man and Woman Sent to Japanese Consulate; Two Chinese Men Detained Awaiting Sentencing. West Inspector Burke of the Public Concession's Narcotics Department received intelligence that a Korean and a Chinese man were selling heroin for profit at house number 21, Lane 5000, Hua Ji Road. The business, known as the "Da Chang Company," was quite prosperous. The inspector, along with Japanese police, rushed to the scene the day before yesterday at noon. They arrested the two main suspects, Korean men, one Korean woman, and accomplices Chen Bingqiu from Ningbo, and Liu Jinde from Shandong, along with 21 small packets of heroin. All were taken to the Huishan Police Station. The three Koreans were sent to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. Yesterday, Chen and Liu were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the Special First Court. A lawyer from the Municipal Council, Zhang Shizhu, explained the case and requested prosecution. The heroin was presented as evidence. Chen confessed that he was hired by the Koreans and paid 40 cents a day. Each packet of heroin was sold for 20 cents, and they could sell over 80 packets a day. He also stated that the operation had only been running for a few days. Liu claimed he was there to consume the heroin to satisfy his opium addiction. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shaoquan, Student at Dazhong Middle School, Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Sent to Hospital, Treatment Failed; Reason for Despair Remains Unknown.</p>
<p>Zhang Shaoquan, a boarding student from Hubei Province at Dazhong Middle School, number 103 Kunshan Road, unexpectedly swallowed opium in the school dormitory the night before last for unknown reasons. A roommate discovered him groaning in bed and reported it to teacher Zhang Xinsheng, who called for an ambulance. Zhang was rushed to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5:30 AM yesterday. The hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. No suicide note or other relevant items were found, so the reason for his death could not be determined. The body was taken to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Around 10:00 AM, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the center to examine the body. Zhang Xinsheng testified that the deceased had just arrived at the school this semester and was in the third grade of junior high school. He seemed honest. He shared a room with four other students, and they attended evening classes for two hours. The previous night, Zhang Xinsheng had taken attendance and noticed nothing unusual. At around midnight, Zhang's roommate told him that Zhang was groaning in bed and seemed very ill. Zhang Xinsheng believed he was sick and immediately called for an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Later, the hospital determined that he had ingested opium, revealing that he had taken poison. It was also heard that he had attempted suicide before. His father's friend, Ye Benchu, has arrived, etc. Ye Benchu further testified that Zhang Jun instructed that the deceased male student Zhang Shaoquan was confirmed to have committed suicide by ingesting opium poison. As the family members have not arrived, the corpse can be handed over to his father's friend Ye Benchu to collect and prepare for burial.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law of Inciting Suicide</h3>
<p>Both Sides Offer Conflicting Accounts; Case Adjourned Pending Judgment.</p>
<p>Chen Huazhang, 59 years old, owner of Shun Sheng Ji Construction Company at number 4 Laerdong Road, Xipushi Road, French Concession, was sued in the Second Special Court's criminal division last month by his daughter-in-law, Chen Yuan (18 years old, local resident), represented by lawyer Shen Xingxia, for the crime of inciting suicide. The accusation stated that the plaintiff was married to Chen Gengsheng, the defendant's adopted son. The defendant, a wealthy construction contractor with a vicious character, often verbally abused the plaintiff, saying that her "eight characters" (birth details) were inauspicious and would affect the Chen family's fortune. He also accused the plaintiff of premarital unchastity. On December 24th of last year, at noon, she was again verbally abused and forced to swallow a box of raw opium. The plaintiff, feeling angry and resentful, lost her senses and, unable to control herself, obeyed the order, hoping to end her miserable life. Fortunately, she was sent to Shijiang Hospital and resuscitated. The plaintiff requested that the defendant be prosecuted for attempted suicide according to the first paragraph of the second clause of Article 275 of the Criminal Law. The defendant vehemently denied inciting suicide. Detectives Xu Guilin and Peng Zhengyou from the French Concession police went to the hospital to investigate and confirm. The court then summoned detectives Xu and Peng, who testified that the police chief received a phone call from the hospital and ordered them to go to the hospital to question Chen Yuan. Chen Yuan denied eating opium. The court adjourned the hearing. Yesterday, Chen Huazhang testified that while he smoked opium due to illness, no one in his family would take his opium. The official ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's lawyer, Shen Xingxia, stated that the Baojiang Hospital report proved three points. As for the opium, it belongs to my defendant, and according to Chen Huazhang himself, he admits to smoking opium. Chen Huazhang incited his daughter-in-law to take poison. Based on Chen's inconsistent testimony and the contradictory statements of the witnesses, it can be concluded that the defendant is indeed guilty of inciting suicide and should be severely prosecuted. The defendant's lawyer argued that the plaintiff swallowing opium is worthy of research. First, the hospital's report does not specify that the plaintiff actually ate opium. Second, the police detectives proved in their report that the plaintiff denied eating opium. Since she did not eat opium and there is no proof that the defendant incited her, how can he be falsely accused? He requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Li concluded the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association to Draw Lottery Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Special First Prize of $25,000; Publicly Held at the City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Central Savings Association's savings business with lottery drawings, principal repayment, and interest payment is booming. Every day, depositors rush to the association, and old depositors from the Sino-French Savings Association come to exchange their documents and continue saving, like a crowded road in Shanyin. To facilitate depositors, the association was open as usual on the day before yesterday, even though it was Sunday. It is reported that the association will hold a public lottery drawing tomorrow at 2:00 PM at the City Chamber of Commerce on North Suzhou Road. The special first prize is $25,000, which is fully guaranteed by the association. According to regulations, half a dollar is drawn from each share as a standard for calculating the special first prize, so 50,000 shares must be reached to have $25,000. Now, the association, in order to benefit depositors, will still award $25,000 even if the 50,000 shares are not met. Once the number exceeds 50,000, the prize will gradually increase to $50,000. It is understood that because the association is just starting out, the number of lottery tickets included in tomorrow's drawing is less than 10,000. The association will have to subsidize over $20,000, so general depositors are joining early to enjoy this special right. Because there are not many numbers, this special prize is very easy to win. It is also heard that, in addition to the special prize, every 2,000 tickets have a first prize of $2,000, a second prize of $300, a third prize of $200, and a fourth prize of $100 each. There are also consolation prizes. For every ten tickets, there must be a last prize of $12. The prize money is large, the amounts are numerous, and the interest paid by the association when the principal is repaid is extremely generous. The depositors' interest fund is calculated on a compound interest basis, and if the account is withdrawn midway, the unearned interest is also added to generate compound interest and paid to depositors who have fully paid their dues. Therefore, the interest alone will be a considerable amount in the future. All these preferential measures are unheard of among the savings associations that were previously operated solely for profit. Therefore, depositors are rushing to join. It is heard that the association cannot catch up with filling out the membership forms, so those who join now will be temporarily issued a temporary receipt with a number so that it can be included in the April lottery. The association's address is number 126 Hankou Road, where those interested in saving can contact the association at any time.</p>
<h3>Two Railways to Offer Joint Travel Tickets Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Railways to issue joint travel round-trip tickets between passenger joint transport stations to facilitate passengers and increase business. The Ministry of Railways has approved the proposal, which will be implemented starting May 1st.</p>
<h3>China Cement Industry Sales Cooperative Established</h3>
<p>The number of cement manufacturing plants in our country is not very large. The business-run ones include Qixin in the north, China Huashang in the south, and the Jiangnan plant, which is about to ship its products. The Huaji plant in the central region is also managed by Qixin. Their total output is more than 3.5 million barrels per year. In previous years, the market was still good, and the business performance was not bad. Since last year, the impact of the recession has affected the industry, resulting in a sharp drop in market prices and sluggish sales. Domestically, there is a unified tax burden (1.2 yuan per barrel, accounting for about a quarter of the market price), and externally, there is the relationship of resisting foreign goods, making it inconvenient to raise prices. Therefore, their situation is very difficult. The heads of the plants have repeatedly decided to cooperate to save themselves, but due to differing opinions, no agreement has been reached for a long time. Recently, Qixin Plant, China Cement Plant, and Jiangnan Cement Plant (which will complete production of 1.2 million barrels per year by the end of this year) have jointly organized the Cement Business General Management Office, with an office on the third floor of Zhejiang Industrial Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road. All the "Horse Brand," "Taishan Brand," "Pagoda Brand," and "Jiangnan Plant's" "Vajra Brand" will be wholesaled by the office, and branch offices will be established in major ports to facilitate customer contact. It is heard that China Huashang Cement Plant is also negotiating and is expected to join soon. This is also fortunate for the future of our country's heavy industry.</p>

The second place was awarded to Li Rutang of Zhonghua University in Wuchang for his essay "The Relationship Between the Scourge of Drugs and the Collapse of Society and Economy." The third place was awarded to Wei Jizheng of the Law School of Daxia University in Shanghai for his essay "The Current Situation of the Scourge of Drugs in Jiangsu and Its Eradication Plan." The fourth place was awarded to Xie Zhangzhe of Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences in Hangzhou for his essay "Investigation of the Current Situation of Drug Poisoning in Zhejiang in the Past Year." The fifth place was awarded to Fang Shangui of the Management College of Jiaotong University in Shanghai for his essay "The Relationship Between the Scourge of Drugs and Social Collapse." It is heard that the association believes that the above essays are all carefully structured works and plans to publish them successively in the association's anti-drug monthly magazine, starting this month, to spread publicity. In addition, the association will award certificates and books to all the winners, and the first to third place winners will also receive prize money, and the association has notified them separately to collect them. The middle school group essays have also been judged and will be announced soon. It is heard that this year's national essay competition for middle and high school students has also been planned and has begun to solicit participation from students across the country.</p>
<h3>How Should the Style of Our Country's Future Architecture Be Transformed?</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Today's question is extremely important. Logically, it is not something that I, someone who has not studied architecture, can make a proposition on. But this question is indeed something that our country should try to answer in the future. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Our country's architecture originally occupied a large position in the history of world architecture and had unique characteristics. However, in recent times, due to cultural decline, this knowledge and art have become increasingly degraded, and there are many outdated aspects. For example, in the past, wood was mainly used as the main material, but this will be impossible in the future, and the ground plane is too wide. If it is not improved, even the inherent characteristics will be extinguished.</p>
<p>(2) The architecture of a country is a representative of its culture and can also be said to be a crystallization. In particular, it has a special relationship with national consciousness, so at least the inherent characteristics and spirit should be preserved, and one or several styles should be freely selected and digested to provide nutrition.</p>
<p>(3) The current state of our country's architecture can be described as mixed, aimless, or not adapted to needs. If this continues, it will affect the general spirit, economy, and academic undertakings of the nation, and the situation is very serious.</p>
<p>For this reason, we must not regard this question as a general question, but should consider it urgent and important.</p>
<p>However, people across the country do not seem to pay enough attention to it. Even the rapid construction scholars and builders seem to be busy dealing with daily affairs and do not have time to study this question. Therefore, I have forgotten whether I am qualified and am using this opportunity to promote the attention and research of my colleagues. This is the reason why I am talking about this question today. However, how easy is it to answer this question? I am afraid that even if the colleagues in the architecture, construction industries come together to earnestly study it for several years, they may not be able to come to a good conclusion. But this question really must be answered, because since 1928 (Republic of China year 17), the whole country has been actively building, spending at least 500 to 600 million yuan every year. Five to six billion in ten years, of which two to three billion large scale projects have already been spent. In the future, there will be an annual increase. If we continue to follow the current situation, how can we be worthy of the country and society? Therefore, how to answer this question is not only the responsibility of architecture scholars and the construction industry, but also the responsibility of the general public.</p>
<p>Now, I offer my very simple opinions for the reference of the public, not to say that this solves the question. On my part, it is only a proposal and assumption.</p>
<p>Due to the times, the point that wood is the main force in our country has to be broken. At the same time, various materials, decorations, and tools are changing accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, due to the times, the point that our country uses large plots of land will also gradually change. Therefore, the overall configuration, the structure of parts, and even the materials and decorations will naturally change accordingly. These are all unavoidable. As for a style (that is, how all forms and functions are organized, connected, and coordinated to enhance each other), a modern Chinese architectural style and design should be produced for the above-mentioned three relationships. I do not agree with swallowing foreign things raw, nor do I agree with necessarily inheriting the old heritage and traditional inheritance.</p>
<p>I especially do not agree with blindly following those who have a smattering of knowledge and piecing things together, plagiarizing and saying that this is Chinese style or Western style.</p>
<p>Because everything in the world cannot be so simply and arbitrarily impersonated. Our country's previous culture certainly cannot be said to be not great, but since the Five Dynasties and the Song and Yuan Dynasties, there has been a lack of progress. Architecture is part of culture.</p>
<p>For this reason, we cannot create, nor can we absorb and digest the essence of foreign countries to become a new product, so we are regressing day by day.</p>
<p>Today, when we seek the transformation of architectural style, the first thing we must focus on is this. Therefore, we must not be bound by inherent or foreign styles (but that does not mean that we will not study inherent or foreign styles, but we must study them deeply. I know that the Chinese Society for Research in Architecture has worked hard for ten years, with the hard work of Mr. Zhu Guixin and the efforts of Liang Sicheng and Liu Shiling. They have not yet researched even half of the inherent architecture. Even the physical objects before the Song Dynasty are difficult to pursue due to too few images. As for specialized research institutions on foreign architecture, I have not heard of any. I deeply hope that there will also be institutions like the Chinese Society for Research in Architecture that bury themselves in hard work and earnestly study various types of architecture in Europe, America, Japan, and even Turkey and India, so that in the future, both sides can mutually verify and discover a very bright and flat road).</p>
<p>Of course, it is not to encourage the so-called creation of superficiality and rashness today. I cannot list what kind of style our country should be transformed into, because I am not an expert, and this question is inherently difficult to answer. But I can say abstractly that the cultural characteristics of our country are profound and beautiful, (that is, the loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace advocated by the General) and since architecture is one of the cultural characteristics, it should naturally melt this spirit into it. Therefore, anything that goes against these four words should not be adopted (regardless of whether it is inherent or foreign) without hesitation. (Therefore, it can be seen that the tendency towards delicacy and superficiality in the architecture of the Ming and Qing dynasties is not worth learning from, and foreign styles such as subtle struggles are not what we should have.) On the contrary, we should preserve and absorb as much as possible.</p>
<p>Among the new architecture, there seem to be very few that meet these conditions, so it can be judged that the country has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and has not obtained a product that is in line with the times.</p>
<p>This is very regrettable. Time passes easily, and money is not easy to come by. In this way, it will just drift with the tide. The rise and fall of a country and nation is related to the rise and fall of its culture. This is not just empty talk. A rising nation can express his strong spirit and great spirit in architecture. History is full of examples. We look up to the Temple of Ramesses in Egypt. The pyramids. Like the Nile, it makes people feel great and solemn. Seeing the Parthenon in Greece and the Colosseum in Rome, even if there are only a few remaining stone pillars and sculptures, we immediately recall the far-reaching cultural and martial achievements of the Greek and Roman nations. The very existence of these remaining pillars and fragments is enough to express the artists' efforts, the cost of labor and materials, and the country's management, forming such a crystallization, which is enough to arouse people's feelings. The St. Peter's Basilica in ancient Rome expressed the authority of religion through the revival of culture at that time, and the palaces of Paris expressed the dignity of the French royal family.</p>
<p>Our country's Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, the statues of Yungang, and the relic pagodas of Qixia are mostly the crystallization of art in the Han, Wei, Sui, and Tang dynasties, and have a large political and economic background.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the material is stone, wood, or brick and tile, use the material according to its properties, adapt to local conditions, and the culture of the times is intertwined with architecture. To go a step further, the difficult struggle and rise of a dynasty, to the decline, clutter, and destruction can be expressed one by one in architecture. Our country's pessimism about architecture today is a major factor in the pessimism about the current situation, so everyone who talks about cultural revival and peaceful struggle, today you have a major responsibility for answering and implementing this question. Let me add one more thing: the architecture of modern countries mostly emphasizes simplicity, profundity, and abundant expression of the key points of the structure and the key points of use. This is also due to the times, and it is impossible not to take into account economic, sanitary, and other aspects, and it is also caused by the evolution of the national and social structure. We cannot forget the needs of the public and the demands of the times, nor should we erase the culture of our origin, so we might as well assume that we take the advantages of our inherent architecture as a foundation to earnestly improve it. For example, many Lama temples in Qinghai and Tibet seem to be very suitable for the use of high-rise buildings in the times.</p>
<p>In short, in such an important period in history as our country encounters, it is not easy to produce a new culture in a dangerous transition. I hope that you and the public will work hard, so that what I have said is not a waste of words.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Province Reports Disastrous Famine</h3>
<p>The Chinese Relief Association in Shanghai has recently received reports from gentlemen and people in southern Shaanxi Province that the spring famine in Xixiang and Ba counties is extremely severe. Hungry people are eating corpses, a tragic scene to behold. Recently, they also received a telegram from Ren Huaqing, chairman of the Zhenwu Branch Association in Xixiang County, stating that the spring famine in the county is severe, with starving people everywhere. There are reports of drowned and abandoned infant boys and girls, and entire families starving to death. If relief is not provided quickly, the future is unimaginable. Please appeal to charitable organizations to provide relief quickly. In addition, the gentlemen and people of the county sent a letter with similar wording. They expressed their admiration for the association's compassion and extensive aid, and earnestly requested charitable donations to provide urgent relief to save the dying people. In previous years, the association provided considerable relief to the disaster-stricken counties in Shaanxi, saving countless lives. Today, Shaanxi Province has suffered another major disaster, but there are no relief funds, leaving them helpless. The association has received reports in Shanghai, and hopes that charitable people in the country will be willing to provide aid, to save lives and perform meritorious deeds during this difficult time of year. The merit and reward will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Public Security and Health Bureaus Jointly Bury Floating Coffins Along Roadsides; Assisting Pushan Villa to Maintain Resident Health</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health and Public Security Bureaus found that there were many floating coffins placed by the poor along the railway tracks between the Shanghai West Station and the Maigen Road Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and between the Shanghai South Station and the Xinlonghua Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Because the coffins were simple, the coffin boards cracked after prolonged periods of rain and sun, and foul odors spread, which was detrimental to health. Therefore, the two bureaus have been dispatching personnel for days to assist Pushan Villa to bury them in situ to maintain resident health.</p>
<h3>Yan Kewei Returns Home After Completing Studies</h3>

<h3>Aviation Association Headquarters Holds 55th Office Meeting</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Shanghai City Recruiting Team of the China Aviation Association held its 55th office meeting the day before yesterday (the 11th) at 4 p.m. at its office, discussing the direction of fundraising. The attendees included Chief Executive Director Li Dachao and Director Zhang Yuliang, among 14 others. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. The Chairman's report briefly stated that the association initiated fundraising to purchase aircraft and present them to the government to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, in order to expand the aviation patriotism movement and commemorate the Chairman. Regarding the name of the fundraising campaign in this city, the team leader proposed it be named "China Aviation Association's Campaign to Expand Aviation Patriotism, Shanghai City Fundraising to Purchase Aircraft, Presented to the Government, in Commemoration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday." In recent days, there has been a positive response from all walks of life. (1) Gu Xin, a leader in the rice and miscellaneous grains industry, decided to raise 90,000 to 100,000 yuan within the industry to purchase an aircraft, named "Food Grain," which is actively underway. (2) Yu Qiaqing informed us by letter that the Ningbo Fellow Association also decided to raise 100,000 yuan to purchase an aircraft. (3) The Shipping Association recently decided at a meeting to send a special birthday gift certificate worth 1,000 yuan. (4) The China Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots also transferred the remaining 8,000 yuan for the aircraft purchase and birthday celebration, demonstrating the admiration and support of all sectors for the leader and their enthusiastic support, which is commendable. The association previously sent letters to all entertainment venues and cinemas in the city, scheduling one day to donate the performance revenue for the aircraft purchase and birthday celebration, and has received affirmative responses from the Grand Stage, Golden Grand Theatre, Enpaiya Theatre, and the Great World Amusement Park. The Golden Enpaiya Theatre has scheduled a performance on the 13th to assist, and it is hoped that other theaters will follow suit and join in this great undertaking. Since the solicitation teams were notified to step up their efforts through circulars, they have been actively working on it. It is hoped that all field staff will work hard to assist. Both trade associations are diligently working to solicit aviation patriotism funds, making active progress. Following reports from various field staff on the progress of contact and investigation, multiple proposals for fundraising were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. Yesterday, the association received responses from compatriots in various places to celebrate the birthday, with many sending one yuan in national currency, including Wu Dechun, Peng Keding, Zeng Zhisu, Zhao Xianbang, Zhang Naijin, Xie Juecheng, Wu Zhonghan, Ren Bingzhi, Ye Zuoping, Dai Zimu, Xu Zhongwen, Luo Yuanzhi, He Yayun, Yang Qingzhi, Tan Jincheng, and Pei Yinmei. In addition, the following agreed to join as initiators for purchasing aircraft for the birthday celebration: Jin Gong, Cheng Shouchong, Zhao Shizhuang, Mei Songxian, Cui Buwu, Zhou Xuexiang, Yan Kechang, Su Shude, Lu Bingqian, Zhu YaKui, Yang Zhenzhong, and Shanghai Minsheng Rubber Factory. The association also received donations of 100 yuan each from Lu Liankui on behalf of Zhang Zhong'an, a national doctor from the Central, Zhongnan, and Nanjing hotels, and from the Foil Industry Association.

<h3>"An Explanation of the Stamp Tax Law" by Yan E'sheng Published</h3>
<p>Yan E'sheng, the secretary of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, has specialized in research on the Stamp Tax Law. After the promulgation of the tax law, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a lecture series, with Yan as the main speaker, explaining the differences between the new tax law and the old regulations, and providing explanations for various stamp tax questions, numbering no less than two or three hundred. Yan, realizing that most ordinary shops do not understand the meaning of the tax law or misunderstand the provisions, resulting in penalties during inspections, has written a simple and easy-to-understand explanation of the Stamp Tax Law. Based on the latest revised tax law and implementing rules, detailed explanations are provided in one hundred sections. The book includes eight appendices of various regulations for reference. The book has now been published and is available for sale at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Dispatch Office, located at the National Chamber of Commerce Federation Office at 59 Hong Kong Road, at the Tianhou Palace Bridge, and at the Libao Daily Office at 289 Jiujiang Road, for a real price of thirty cents per copy.

<h3>Major Theft Occurs at Tongren Silk Fabric Shop on Wuhua Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Tongren Silk Fabric Shop on Wuhua Road in Zhabei Xiangyanqiao, a large-scale and prosperous business, was suddenly burgled yesterday morning at about 4 o'clock. The thieves broke the iron lock on the back door, dismantled the iron mesh, and entered the shop, taking away forty-odd bolts of silk fabrics such as brocade crepe and wool tweed from the glass cabinet before fleeing. The shop's employees were all asleep at the time of the theft and did not notice anything. It was not until dawn that they realized that the stolen fabrics were worth more than 2,000 yuan. The transport would have taken some time, indicating that it was a large gang of thieves who had organized in advance. The police station is only a few dozen yards away from the shop, and there are uniformed police officers stationed in front of the shop, yet they were completely unaware, which is truly extraordinary.</p>
<h3>Theft of Watch Leads to Impersonation of Detective for Extortion</h3>
<p>Ren Bingsheng, a 49-year-old resident of Jiangwan District, lives at No. 2, Lane 248, Xinshi Road, Jiangwan District, and works as a laborer for a living. Last month, a watch he purchased at his workplace was stolen by Fan Zixiang and sold to Wang Linbao, who lives nearby at No. 337. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, Wang wore the watch to a tea house, where Ren recognized that the watch was his stolen property. When questioned, Wang claimed that he bought it from Fan. He reported it to the police on duty, who detained Fan for questioning. Suddenly, Meng Degong, a man from Hebei, learned of the situation and impersonated a detective, threatening Ren and Wang in an attempt to extort money. He was arrested for theft and impersonating a public official for extortion, a criminal matter, and was transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Huang Chujiu's Family's Lawsuit for Damage to Creditor's Rights Withdrawn; Huang's Counterclaim Cannot Be Withdrawn; Trial Concluded Yesterday, Verdict Awaited</h3>
<p>Huang Wang Juzhen, the wife of the deceased Huang Chujiu, and her sons, Xianzhong and Xianyao, were involved in a lawsuit with Gu Yuqi of Tongde Hospital over a construction fee of 47,500 yuan. During the second instance appeal, a settlement was reached for repayment. This matter came to the attention of Shui Jiantang, the creditor of the Gongfa Company. Shui claimed that after Huang Chujiu's death, his family had been declared bankrupt and was in the process of clearing debts, and therefore, they could not dispose of the property without authorization. Shui believed that Huang's mother and sons were suspected of damaging their creditor's rights, so he filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, requesting legal action. The court summoned the defendants, but Huang Xianyao did not appear. Huang Wang Juzhen and Huang Xianzhong appeared in court and stated that they had reached a settlement with Tongde Hospital, and the creditors of Gongfa had convened a meeting and agreed to the settlement, which was evidenced by the meeting minutes. Shui Jiantang filed a counterclaim accusing them of false accusation, and as it was necessary to summon witnesses and retrieve records, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengheng resumed the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Shui Jiantang, appeared in court represented by a lawyer and filed a motion to withdraw the lawsuit, stating that the debt dispute between the defendants and Tongde Hospital was due to charitable concerns, and the settlement was reached through the mediation of local dignitaries, which was understandable. This case was filed under Article 356 of the Criminal Law and could be withdrawn according to law. Judge Sun stated that the counterclaim filed by Huang Wang Juzhen could not be withdrawn and proceeded with the hearing. After questioning Wang Juzhen and Huang Xianzhong about the grounds for the counterclaim, Pan Zhaobang, the liquidator and accountant of Gongfa Company, was summoned to testify. Pan stated that Shui Jiantang did not have a lawyer to represent him during the meeting regarding the debt dispute with Tongde Hospital, and the content of the settlement was unknown. After lengthy debate by the lawyers of both parties, the debate was declared closed. The court ordered that the verdict in this case be delivered on the 20th of this month and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Two Robbery Suspects Transferred to Jiading County Government</h3>
<p>Wang Yueshan and Yang Jinrong (from Yancheng), both from Jiading, have recently been gathering gangs and holding weapons to rob residents of their property in the Jiading area. They fled to Shanghai and hid in Room 28, Heliin Lane, Yulin Road, evading the law. At 3:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Bin, the detective captain of the county government, based on the confession of the captured criminal Li Asi, reported to the Yulin Road Police Station and requested assistance in the arrest. The chief assigned detective Ruan Taibin to secretly go to the address and arrest the two robbers, Wang and Yang, and take them to the police station for detention. (1) Yesterday, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated the previous situation and expressed agreement with the transfer. Subsequently, Zhang Bin, the detective captain of the Jiading County Government, submitted an official letter, stating that the two defendants had committed numerous robberies. A suitcase containing 23 pieces of clothing and some stolen goods was seized at No. 28, Heliin Lane, and was transferred to the Jiading County Government along with the suspects.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in Robbery Case Brought Back for Joint Trial</h3>
<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective, and Ye Yusi, a detective officer, of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, arrested a large number of bandits from Wuxi, including Qian Jinrong and 15 other men and women, on the 27th of last month in Rooms 875 and 876 of the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road and Room 210 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road. Three pistols and 24 bullets were seized and sent to the First Special Court. It was determined that the women Zhang Ying, Li Feng, Zhou Fengying, and Shi Zhao were not involved and were released first, while the rest were remanded in custody for further investigation. Later, Detective Shao, who was in charge of the case, discovered that these people, along with Wang Rongsheng from Zhenjiang, Wang Liansheng from Suzhou, and Zhang Ada from Wuxi, who were convicted in the Second Special Court for robbery, had robbed residents of Tongfu Road, Chengdu Road, and Seymour Road. The day before yesterday, they used an official letter from the First Special Court to bring the three criminals back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that Qian Jinrong and others had committed seven robberies and requested that the case be transferred to the First Special Court for a joint trial with the three men, Wang Rongsheng, and others. Judge Xiao XieFen approved the request and ordered that the three men, Wang, and others be temporarily detained and that the case be jointly tried in the Second Criminal Court on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Wu Xingen's Home Robbed</h3>
<p>Wu Xingen, also known as "Blind Xingen," is a well-known gambler. A few months ago, he was the boss of a gambling operation at the dock. Wu lives at No. 12, Jin Yu Lane, No. 405, South Sward Road. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. yesterday, three bandits speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly came to his home to rob. Two bandits were armed with pistols. First, they tricked all his family members into going to an empty room, then used ropes and nails to nail the door shut before starting to rob. All the boxes and chests were opened or destroyed. All the banknotes and foreign currency inside, totaling more than 500 yuan, as well as valuable jewelry and clothing, were looted. Although the robbery was reported to the police station afterward, it was too late to apprehend the robbers. The case has been filed for investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on South Sward Road</h3>
<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday, six robbers broke into a home on South Sward Road, No. 12 Jin Yu Lane. They pulled out pistols, threatening the occupants to remain silent. They ransacked the house, searching wantonly. The victims reported that they were robbed of more than 500 yuan in national currency, as well as jewelry and clothing, worth several hundred yuan. The robbers fled with the stolen goods. The victims immediately reported the incident to the local police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Disguises Himself to Arrest Prostitutes</h3>
<p>The Yimiao Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has recently noticed that due to the strict prohibition of prostitution in the French Concession, the area under its jurisdiction, which borders the French Concession, has seen an influx of prostitutes, including both licensed and unlicensed ones, soliciting customers in entertainment venues such as Xiaodongmen Fuan and Fuyou Road Small World in the city. Therefore, the station ordered the police chief and others to disguise themselves and go to various entertainment venues to investigate. The night before last, two prostitutes attempted to seduce the disguised police chief at Small World and were taken to the station. One was identified as Wang Qun'e, 19 years old, from Liyang, residing at No. 8, Yuancheng Lane, Anrenfang, in the city. The other was Wang Aizhen, 21 years old, from Xinghua, residing at No. 5, Caishi Street, in the French Concession. The station chief, considering them to be a threat to public morals, sent them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Current Economic Situation in China from the 1935 Business Report of Jin Cheng Bank</h3>
<p>The 1935 Business Report of Jin Cheng Bank, which was announced at the shareholders' meeting on the 12th of this month, describes the domestic and international economic and financial situation in great detail. It is a valuable piece of work. Due to space limitations, we can only excerpt the chapter "Analysis of the Current Economic Situation in China" as follows to introduce it to our readers.</p>
<p>The current state of China's overall economy is like treating an illness. If the root cause is not clear, there will be no way to prescribe the right medicine. National economic construction is the same. First, we must understand the actual situation and find the key points. Only then will there be a basis for planning. Therefore, I will briefly describe the current situation of our country's agriculture, minerals, industry, transportation, etc. as follows:</p>
<p>Agriculture: In the past four years, the average national grain production has been 895,200,000 shi dan of rice, 446,700,000 shi dan of wheat, and 241,500,000 shi dan of sweet potatoes. The remaining sorghum, millet, corn, etc. are all around 120,000 dan. The five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River region produce the most rice, accounting for almost half of the country's total rice production. The three provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan in the Southwest region account for 7%. The coastal region produces the most wheat, accounting for 44% of the country's total production. The five provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Yellow River region account for 27%. The five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River region account for 24%. The production of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan in the Southwest region and Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai in the Northwest region is minimal. The coastal region of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong also leads in millet production, accounting for 54% of the country's total production. The Yellow River region of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan accounts for 38%. The production of corn and sorghum is also mainly in the six provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong in the coastal region, each accounting for more than 50% of the country's total production. This is the general picture of grain production in our country. Cotton is the main clothing material. In the past four years, the national average annual cotton production has been 15,540,000 shi dan. The coastal provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong account for 55% of the country's total production. The five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River region account for 23%. The five provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Yellow River region also account for more than 20%. In addition, the four provinces of Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai in the Northwest region and the three provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan in the Southwest region produce less than 200,000 dan each year.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned grain production quantities, they are all concentrated in the coastal and Yangtze River regions. Rice production accounts for 92% of the country's total production, and wheat production accounts for 68%. The production of major clothing materials such as cotton is also most important in the coastal region.</p>
<p>In recent years, floods, droughts, and insect pests have damaged crops, and opium poppies and poisonous weeds have occupied farmland. In addition, the immature methods of land use and the small size of farms have all reduced agricultural harvests, leading to the import of food and clothing materials. The imported food includes 25,928,962 shi dan of rice, 10,418,174 shi dan of wheat, and 1,020,992 shi dan of flour. If we take the average import from 1933 to this year (1935), it is 22,350,996 shi dan of rice, 13,658,852 shi dan of wheat, and 2,000,237 shi dan of flour. However, the amount of food shortage in our country is far more than this. It is estimated that imported food only accounts for 22% of the food shortage. This proves that national consumption is insufficient, and some people do not have adequate livelihood. Although cotton production has increased in recent years, it is still not enough to meet consumption. The average annual import surplus is about 20,000 dan, which shows that the shortage of food and clothing is quite large.</p>
<p>Mining: China has quite a large coal reserve, second only to the United States and Canada. According to the report of the Geological Survey Institute, the total amount in the country is about 2,482,870,000,000 metric tons, equivalent to twice the amount in the UK and Germany, or more than 30 times that of Japan. Among them, the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Yellow River region have the richest deposits, totaling 2,066,220,000,000 tons, accounting for more than 80% of the country's coal reserves. The Yangtze River, Northwest, Coastal, and Southwest regions together have about 370,000,000,000 tons, accounting for about 14%. Although the reserves are large, the output is quite low, with an annual output of only about 28,000,000 metric tons. The coastal region of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong produces the most, accounting for about 40% of the total output. The largest coal mines are Fushun and Kailuan. The former is operated by the South Manchuria Railway, with a capital of 100 million Japanese yen, and produces 7.5 million tons of coal annually. The latter is a Sino-British joint venture, with a capital of 2 million British pounds, and produces 8 million tons of coal annually. The largest coal mine completely funded by Chinese capital is Zhongxing, which produces more than 1.3 million tons of coal annually, which is still far from Kailuan. As for the cost of coal mining, Kailuan is only 2.2 yuan per ton, while Zhongxing is 3.5 yuan, and Changxing Company is as high as 5 yuan. Coupled with the high transportation costs and heavy taxes, domestic coal production cannot compete with foreign coal.</p>
<p>Petroleum plays a particularly important role in national defense, industry, and transportation. In recent years, the construction of domestic highways has developed rapidly, and aviation and military affairs have also developed daily. The need for petroleum is increasing daily. According to estimates by Chinese petroleum accountants, our country's petroleum is extremely scarce. In 1920, the US Geological Survey published a report on China's petroleum reserves, estimating them at 1.375 trillion barrels, distributed in the provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Gansu, and Xinjiang, plus 1.899 trillion barrels of shale oil in Fushun, Liaoning. The total oil reserves in the country are 3.274 trillion barrels. As for petroleum production, it is even more scarce. The current producers include the Yanchang Petroleum Official Mine in Shaanxi, the salt fields in the Ziliujing area of ​​Sichuan, and several oil refineries in Xinjiang. Except for Fushun and other places, there is only the Shijiazhuang coking plant of the Jingxing Coal Mine in Guannei. The total oil production in Guannei averages only 3,000 barrels or 126,000 gallons per year. The annual import of oil materials reaches 240 million gallons. The domestic production is only 1/2000 of the import volume.</p>
<p>Our country's iron ore reserves are extremely scarce. According to the estimate of the Geological Survey Institute, the total reserves in the country are about 100,019,000 tons, which is only 6/1000 of the world's iron ore reserves. 3/4 are located outside Guannei (Northeast), and the remaining 1/4 is distributed in the provinces of Chahar, Hebei, Hubei, and Anhui. Chahar accounts for 9%, Hubei accounts for 5%, Hebei accounts for 3%, Anhui accounts for 2%, and other provinces together account for 6%. The average annual iron sand production in recent years is about 2.23 million tons. The Anshan and Benxi Lake mines operated by the Japanese account for 37% of the country's total output. The remaining mines such as Hanyeping Elephant Nose Hill in Hubei and Yufan Baoxing Fulimin in Anhui account for 44% of the output. However, all these minerals are exported to Japan. Including the production of the above-mentioned Anshan and Benxi Lake mines, more than 80% of China's iron ore production is exported to Japan.</p>
<p>Industry: China's modern cotton spinning industry has a history of more than 40 years. The geographical distribution of domestic yarn factories is mostly concentrated in the coastal area. Among the 92 factories, 69 are in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Shandong in the coastal region, and Shanghai alone has as many as 31 factories. The remaining six factories are in each of Hubei and Shanxi, and four factories are in Henan. The distribution of yarn spindles is similar, and the uneven geographical distribution is obvious. The weaving industry has also been developed for a long time. There are currently 29,579 looms in the country. However, the capital of each factory is meager, with an average of only 20,000 yuan per factory. The total number of cloths produced is 15,254,153 bolts. With such a large population in our country, this number is too small. Therefore, a large amount of cloth is still imported every year. The geographical distribution of cloth factories is the same as that of yarn factories. Shanghai alone has 213 factories, and the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang together account for more than 3/5. There are 13 factories in the provinces of the Yangtze River region and 12 factories in the provinces of the Yellow River region. The scale is small. Machine-made flour milling is one of China's emerging industries. There are 56 flour mills in the country, with a capital of 24,525,000 yuan, and an annual production of about 64,963,000 bags, which is less than 1/4 of the national flour consumption. The insufficient amount is supplemented by homemade flour and imported foreign flour. The geographical distribution of flour mills is also biased towards the coastal provinces. There are 45 flour mills in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, accounting for 3/4 of the total capital and more than 87% of the total production.</p>
<p>Among the chemical industries, the acid-base industry is very important for national defense. There are currently six acid-making factories in our country, three in Shanghai, two in Tianjin, and one in Guangxi. Except for one British-owned factory, the rest are operated by Chinese. The five Chinese-funded factories can produce 59,750 dan of hydrochloric acid and 110,210 dan of sulfuric acid annually. However, nitric acid is still lacking. The domestic consumption of acids is increasing daily, and a large amount is imported every year. For example, in 1934, 20,398 hectoliters of hydrochloric acid, 29,615 hectoliters of nitric acid, and 13,172 hectoliters of sulfuric acid were imported. It can be seen that our country's production is far from enough to meet demand. There are currently five alkali-making factories, one in Shanghai, one in Tanggu, one in Hangu, and two in Sichuan. The annual output reaches 757,100 dan, of which Yongli Factory accounts for 633,000 dan. In addition, the annual production of natural alkali is about 610,000 dan, and a lot is also imported from overseas. There are six cement factories in the country, with a capital of 20 million yuan and an annual output of about 7.4 million dan. The amount is already quite large, but it is still not enough to meet demand. Imports still reach 3.7 million dan in recent years. The match industry has developed rapidly in recent years. However, due to the dumping of foreign goods, production is instead oversupplied. Thanks to the low price, domestic leather is still sufficient for use in the leather industry, which is rare. There are more than 40 machine-made paper industries in the country, with a capital of 5.5 million yuan, and the total value of production is nearly 10 million yuan. There are about 56,000 households making paper by traditional methods in the country. The production value has recently decreased to 17 million yuan. The total value of paper produced this year is 27 million yuan. However, the annual consumption of paper in our country reaches more than 66 million yuan, and the import of foreign paper is about 40 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>Our country's machine manufacturing industry lacks capital and is small in scale, which cannot be compared with foreign factories. There are 12 factories with a capital of more than 100,000 yuan, 80 factories with a capital of more than 10,000 yuan, and 144 factories with a capital of more than 3,000 yuan. The total capital is 4,296,000 yuan, and the total value of products is 10,152,000 yuan. Factories with a capital of more than 100,000 yuan are only located in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and are mostly concentrated in Shanghai. Those with a capital of more than 10,000 yuan are also distributed in several coastal provinces. Most of the factories produce simple machine parts, and sophisticated and large ones still rely on imports.</p>
<p>Transportation: Highway construction has progressed rapidly since 1927. By 1934, the mileage of open roads reached 98,000 kilometers. Guangdong Province has the longest length, with more than 11,200 kilometers. Shandong, Shanxi, and Anhui provinces are next, each with more than 4,000 kilometers. Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei are again next, while Qinghai and Xikang have the least, each with only a few hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>According to the statistics in 1934, the total length of railways in our country is 18,000 kilometers, of which state-owned railways account for more than 60% of the total railway length, private railways account for 13%, and foreign-owned railways account for 17%. The distribution of state-owned railways is the largest in the coastal region of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, accounting for 44% of the state-owned railways. The Northeast region is next, accounting for 25%. The middle reaches of the Yellow River, including Shaanxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Henan, and Chahar provinces, are again next, accounting for 21%. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River, including Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces, account for only 10%. There are almost no railways in the Northwest and Southwest provinces.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Ministry of Communications, the total tonnage of merchant ships in the country is more than 400,000 tons, which is only 1/10 of Japan's and 6/1000 of the world's shipping tonnage. The coastal routes are centered on Shanghai, with Guangzhou and Tianjin as the concentration points at the north and south ends. The inland river transportation is operated from south to north. However, due to rainfall and climate, the navigation of rivers in North China and Northeast China is not as convenient as that of the Yangtze River and the West River.</p>
<p>Finance: Finance is the main tool for the government to develop the economy. The annual income of China's central government is about 900 million yuan, of which tax revenue accounts for the largest proportion, about 8/10 of the total amount, followed by domestic public debt, accounting for about 2/10 of the total amount. Customs duties and salt taxes account for more than 80% of the total tax revenue, followed by unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes account for more than 15%. The above four items are indirect consumption taxes. As for the geographical distribution of tax revenue, the six provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong in the coastal region account for more than 8/10 of the total amount, the five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River region account for 1.5/10, the five provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Yellow River region account for 0.3/10, and the three provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan in the Southwest region account for 0.2/10. This phenomenon reflects that the economic center of our country is biased towards the coastal region. In terms of expenditure, military expenditure accounts for a larger proportion, always around 4/10, debt expenditure accounts for about 3/10, and other items such as transportation, industry, diplomacy, and education together account for only 2-3/10.</p>
<p>North China: If the current situation of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan in North China remains unchanged for a long time, they will be reduced from hinterland to border towns. The special status and economic importance should have a clear understanding beforehand. Therefore, it is specially listed separately to promote the attention of the Chinese people. The agricultural products of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan are mainly wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, soybeans, cotton, and tobacco. Wheat is the most important. The wheat produced in North China is 127,143,000 shi dan, accounting for 1/3 of the total national production. The production of sorghum also accounts for 1/3 of the country. The production of corn and tobacco each accounts for 1/4 of the country. Soybeans account for 1/5, cotton gardens account for 1/3 of the national production, and millet accounts for 1/2. Most of the cotton and tobacco are exported and are major export commodities. Wheat, sorghum, millet, and corn are mainly for self-sufficiency. The fisheries of the coastal provinces of Hebei and Shandong are quite developed, and the number of fishermen accounts for more than 1/5 of the country. The animal husbandry in the provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan is also considerable. Taking the five provinces as a whole, the number of cattle and horses accounts for more than 1/10 of the country, pigs and sheep account for more than 1/6, and mules and donkeys account for 1/4. Mules and donkeys are mostly used for carrying heavy loads. The by-products of cattle, sheep, and pigs, such as fur and bristles, are major export commodities. In terms of minerals, coal and iron are the most important. The coal reserves of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan account for 45% of the national coal reserves. Shanxi province alone accounts for 52%. The coal production of the five provinces also accounts for 43% of the national coal production. Hebei accounts for 24%, Shandong accounts for 11%, Shanxi accounts for 8%, and Suiyuan and Chahar together account for less than 1%. As for the iron ore reserves of the five provinces, they account for 13% of the national iron reserves. Chahar accounts for 9%, Hebei accounts for 3%, and Shandong accounts for 1%. In addition to coal and iron, the salt production of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan accounts for about 1/3 of the country, natural alkali accounts for 40%, asbestos accounts for 49%, and nitrate accounts for 29%. The reserves of kaolin and gold are also quite rich. As for industry, the largest industry in China is the cotton spinning industry. The country has a total of 1.81 million spindles, and the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan account for 18% of the national number of spindles. Shandong accounts for 10%, Hebei accounts for 6%, and Shanxi accounts for 2%.

Hebei accounts for 17%, Shandong accounts for 7%, and Shanxi accounts for 1%. The status of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan is also very important in other industries. The carpet industry in Tianjin is a major export of our country. Yaohua in Qinhuangdao is a famous glass factory in our country. Jiuda Yongli in Tanggu is a giant in our country's chemical industry, and its products are sold in large quantities overseas. The lace and hairnet industries in Yantai, the rayon cloth in Gaoyang, and the art industry in Beiping are all important industries in North China. In terms of transportation, North China's transportation developed earlier. Although the progress has been slower in recent years, it is still a convenient area for domestic transportation, especially the railway. Except for the Northeast, the national state-owned railways are about 9,000 kilometers, and the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan account for 51%. Hebei accounts for 25%, Shandong accounts for 14%, Shanxi and Suiyuan each account for 5%, and Chahar accounts for 3%. Among the state-owned railways, the Pinghan, Beining, Jinpu, Pingsui, Jiaoji, and Zhengtai six lines, either the entire line or most of them are within the territory of the five provinces of North China. In terms of highways, the national passable highways are 85,000 kilometers, and the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan account for 15%. Shandong accounts for 6%, Chahar accounts for 3%, and Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan each account for 2%.

Yantai accounts for 5.5%, Tianjin accounts for 3%, and Qingdao accounts for 1%. In terms of trade, the foreign trade of the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan is concentrated in the six ports of Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Longkou, and Weihaiwei in Hebei and Shandong, and the amount accounts for about 19% of the national foreign trade amount. Tianjin accounts for 11%, Jiaozhou accounts for 5%, and the other four ports together account for 3%. Its re-export trade also accounts for about 20% of the national total. In terms of finance and finance, there are 159 head offices of banks nationwide, and there are 513 in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, which is 1/10. There are 1,188 branches, and the five provinces account for 259, which is 1/5. In terms of finance, the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan account for more than 1/5 of the central tax revenue, and local tax revenue accounts for 1/5 of the national total.</p>
<h3>Operating Profit and Loss for 1935</h3>
<p>The operating profit and loss of the bank in 1935 is attached as follows: (A) Total surplus of the commercial and savings departments: The total surplus of the commercial and savings departments in this year is 2,176,135.72 yuan, while it was 1,998,019.63 yuan in the previous year.

<h3>Shen Siliang Returns to Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss: Athletics Pre-Selection to First Hold Training Classes, Basketball Training for Seventy Days, Western Boxing Offered at Own Expense, Football Team's Three Matches in Shanghai Have Schedule Already Arranged</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Siliang, the Secretary-General of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, who went north to negotiate the World Games athletics pre-selection, returned to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday morning. This reporter paid him a special visit, and according to him, our participation in the World Games is proceeding smoothly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Athletics Pre-Selection to be Held in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shen, most of the details of this trip to the north have already been reported in the Peiping dispatches of various newspapers in recent days. However, there is a slight discrepancy regarding item (C) of the motion concerning the World Games representative pre-selection, which stated that the athletics pre-selection would be hosted in Shanghai as an international athletics competition, so as to select representatives from it. In fact, the official name at that time will still be the World Games athletics pre-selection, but the Federation will invite famous athletes from various Shanghai teams to participate in order to compete. The Federation will invite responsible persons from Western sports organizations in Shanghai within two weeks to discuss this matter. This pre-selection is gathering the elite from all over the country, and the strength is strong. It is feared that the Southern participants may not be willing to participate due to the lack of competitive possibilities. Therefore, the international competition and the World Games pre-selection are completely different in nature and should not be confused as one thing.</p>
<p>Basketball Training Set for Seventy Days</p>
<p>As for the training period for the basketball team in Peiping, it has now been decided to be seventy days, ending on June 10. They will concentrate in Shanghai on June 20. The ten days from June 10 to 20 will be for the players to take care of their personal matters. On June 26, the Olympics will have athletes useful for national arts, walking, weightlifting, boxing, etc. go abroad together. As for swimming representatives, they will be selected by the Hong Kong side. However, the number of people to be selected has not yet been determined. It will be decided around the beginning of next month after the Sports Federation receives a report. The previous selection of Fu Guo, Zhen Heng, Chen Zhenxing, and Yang Xiuqiong is merely speculation. However, judging from the past achievements of the three gentlemen, they are quite qualified to be selected. The selection criteria for swimming will be based on recent results. Those who enjoyed a good reputation in the past but have now regressed will inevitably be abandoned and not selected.</p>
<p>Football Match Order in Shanghai</p>
<p>The official list of our World Games football team will be finalized and announced within two or three days. Rong Qizhao and Zhou Jiaqi, who went to Hong Kong, will soon return to Shanghai first. The representative team will still have two practice matches in Hong Kong, and will depart from Hong Kong on the 22nd to come to Shanghai. There will be three practice matches in Shanghai. It has been decided that they will play against Portugal on the 25th, the Shanghai Western Allied Team on the 26th, and the Shanghai China-China Team on the 29th. The venues are all in China. The representative team may go to Nanjing for a visit, and a performance match is planned in Nanjing. The team to play against is currently being negotiated. The date is the 30th of this month, and they will return to Shanghai that night. They are scheduled to go abroad first on May 2, touring various places in Southeast Asia, and have arranged about 20 matches. Finally, they will meet with the entire representative team in the United Kingdom and go to Germany together.</p>
<p>Explanation of Increasing Boxing Slots</p>
<p>When asked about the boxing pre-selection, it was said that this time the boxing athletes were recommended by the 32nd Army. The commander of the 32nd Army, Mr. Shang Zhen, attaches great importance to military sports. There was originally no Western boxing event in our country's participation in the World Games. Later, Mr. Shang, in order to enable talents in this field to gain world knowledge, sent personnel to participate. However, due to the World Games rules, he could not report to the conference alone, so he sent a letter to the Sports Federation to handle it and join the World Games representative country. The funding for this item is entirely borne by the 32nd Army. This time, when I went to Peiping, I also contacted the authorities of the 32nd Army. In the boxing competition to be held in Xiqing tomorrow night (i.e., the 14th), the athletes recommended by the army will be determined.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling Will Not Go to Germany</p>
<p>The reporter then asked that recently, Mr. Shi Youhui of the China Walking Association had said that he would give up walking. Mr. Shen replied cautiously that the Sports Federation was not unwilling to increase the quota, but was limited by the allocation of funds. As for those who blamed him for increasing the quota in boxing, the fact is that the boxing funds are entirely provided by the 32nd Army, which is different from the World Games representative country, as mentioned above. I am afraid that the China Walking Association also did not understand this situation, so I hope that all sectors can understand. Mr. Shen finally said that he got off the train in Tianjin and visited Mr. Zhang Boling to ask if he could go to Germany together. Mr. Zhang said that he could not go to participate due to school affairs. The Standing Committee of the Sports Federation will be convened within two weeks.</p>
<p>Athletics Training Starts on the 20th</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) The pre-selection training class for our country's World Games athletics team was originally scheduled to start training on the 16th of this month. Recently, due to the short time and insufficient preparation, it has been changed to start on the 20th of this month. Training is still at the National Tsinghua University in the western suburbs of Peiping, ending on May 25. Registration is now open to the National Sports Federation in Shanghai. Only males are accepted. Report to the Sports Department of Tsinghua University from the 18th to the 20th of this month. Tsinghua will not be responsible for accommodation before the 18th. Participants must meet the qualified test standards to register (the test standards are the same as the national World Games athletics pre-selection standards). Whether they pass or not, travel expenses are at their own expense. Participants must also undergo a standard test three days after registration. Those who pass will be provided with food and accommodation by the Sports Federation, and only those who pass the final test standard at the end of the training period will be provided with travel expenses to Shanghai for the pre-selection by the National Sports Federation. Those who fail the first test cannot participate in the training, but those whose results are not much different can also participate in the training if permitted by the association. When they pass the test in the future, they will receive equal treatment from the date of passing. All trainees must abide by all training rules and Tsinghua University rules. John Ma will be the instructor, and Xia Xiang and Li Zhong will be assistant instructors. The draft of the training class regulations has been drafted by Mr. Ma and has been sent to Shanghai to the Standing Committee of the National Sports Federation for review and approval before it can be announced.

<h3>Six of Our Country's Handball Masters to Participate in This Year's Open Handball Tournament, Matches to Begin on the 20th</h3>
<p>The open handball singles and doubles tournament organized by the Western YMCA was scheduled to close registration yesterday and will be held starting on the 20th. Our country's handball masters all have great ambitions for this international competition, hoping to occupy a high position. According to the association, there are three Chinese doubles teams participating: Zhu Kuan and Sun Daotai, Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu, and Sun Sulu and He Shogeng. In singles, except for Sun Daotai and Yan Peiqiu, who cannot participate due to their duties, the rest will participate in the war. Detailed lists and competition procedures will be announced as soon as they are compiled.</p>
<h3>Inter-Port Friendship Match: Shanghai Defeats Guolian with a Score of Five to Two</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Tianjin, 13th. The Shanghai vs. Tianjin Guolian football match was held at the English Stadium at 2:30 PM on the 13th. The sky was overcast and drizzling, stopping and starting from time to time. The ground was wet and the ball was heavy, making it difficult to exert force. At 4:05 PM, the score was 5-3, Shanghai defeated Tianjin. Boselli scored two goals, and Greenberg scored two goals. The Shanghai team will leave Tianjin on the 17th and return south.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the match, Shanghai's center forward, Lin Jing, returned south due to an incident and was replaced by Greenberg. There were no other changes in position. The strength and coordination were not very good. After three minutes, Tianjin's five forwards squeezed in, and Yongquan opened the ball and scored a goal. After that, Tianjin's momentum was extremely strong and continued to attack. Shanghai only had the skill to resist. After fifteen minutes, Jones took advantage of the situation and scored another goal. Shanghai changed its strategy and completely defended. It was not until thirty minutes that there was a slight turnaround. With Fu Enfu's proper command, Boselli caught up and scored a goal. Later, Tianjin's left inside forward, Johnson, and center back, Larry, were injured and left the field one after another, fighting hard with nine players. The first half ended with a score of one to two.</p>
<p>In the second half, Tianjin replenished its team with reserve players. Shanghai's Greenberg and Boselli changed positions and were both active. Not long after the start, Boselli stole a ball under the enemy's feet and brought it to the fifteen-yard line and scored. Greenberg kicked in two goals in the melee fifteen minutes later, and then fought hand-to-hand in front of the enemy's goal and squeezed in two goals. After that, both sides had attacks, but the opportunities were lost, just a little bit off. In the last two minutes, Wen Kui got the support of the center back, brought the ball to the front of the goal, and lightly scored.</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an said that there was a lot of floating soil on the field, and it was hard underneath. The rain made the ball wet, and there were many mistakes in lifting the feet. The failure of the first day's match was mostly due to this.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup: USA Eliminates Mexico, USA Wins Doubles Again</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 12th. In the Davis Cup American Zone competition between the United States and Mexico, the United States won two singles matches yesterday. Today, the American doubles team, Allison and Van Ring, won again. In total, the United States has eliminated Mexico with a score of three to zero and will hold the American Zone finals with Cuba on May 30, 31, and June 1.</p>
<h3>City Bureau of Education Announces City Elementary School Joint Sports Regulations, Pre-Selection in Each District to be Completed by the End of the Month, All Methods to Follow the National Games</h3>
<p>The 7th City Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, organized by the Shanghai City Bureau of Education, will be held at the City Center Stadium for three days starting on May 14. The city is divided into nineteen districts, and the pre-selection in each district must be completed by the end of the month in order to report and select representatives to participate in the joint sports meet. All methods will follow the National Games, which is different from previous elementary school sports meets. According to the city's elementary school sports meet, eight sessions have been held so far. From the first to the sixth session, a joint system was adopted, and each school participated freely. It was held at the City No. 1 Stadium every year. However, because the number of participants increased year by year, the venue was small, causing difficulties. Moreover, schools in rural areas were far away, making it inconvenient to travel back and forth, so many had no chance to participate, which was not in line with universal sports. The Bureau of Education changed its approach last year, dividing the city into eight districts and adopting a district system. In rural and remote areas, all schools can participate. The number of schools has doubled compared to the past. However, holding it by district makes it difficult to compare the merits of each district, and the fun of competition is also reduced. Therefore, in this sports meet, the Bureau of Education will specially imitate the National Games method, first conduct pre-selection by district, and then hold a joint meeting, so that universal sports and the fun of competition can be achieved. The method has been greatly improved. The rules of this year's joint sports meet are as follows:</p>

<h3>Xiqing Hosts International Boxing Tonight, Order Changes, Begins at 9:15 at the Association, Ding Ge and Guan Talk about Brilliant Performances by Chinese Athletes</h3>
<p>The International Boxing Match, hosted by the Western YMCA of this newspaper, is scheduled to be held in the basketball room of the association at 9:15 tonight. It will be divided into ten groups of confrontations. The participants are divided into groups with the 32nd Army with four people, the Jingwu Sports Association with three people, St. John's University with two people, Xiqing with five people, Summer Camp with four people, and the British Army with two people. By nationality, there are nine Chinese, two British, three American, two Portuguese, two Jewish, one Russian, and one Javanese. According to Ding and Ge, the boxing coaches of Xiqing, there are actually nine Chinese participating in this international competition, and the strength of the participants is so strong, which can be described as unprecedented. After being trained by myself and Mr. Chen Qiang, the four athletes of the 32nd Army have made rapid progress, especially Zhu Yonglan. Li Mengkui and Gui Di's results are also good, but Gui's progress is slow due to illness. Although he has recovered recently, his strength will be damaged. In short, the skills of the four athletes have changed greatly compared to before, and they will be able to perform brilliantly tonight. In addition, the five athletes from Yueda Jingwu are also the best of the time. It is reported that tickets are divided into four types: two yuan, one and a half yuan, one yuan, and five cents.

<h3>Grain: Foreign Wheat Rises Frequently During Market Closure, Standard Flour is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After opening in the morning, prices for all months showed an initial stabilization followed by a sharp increase. Foreign wheat quotations, during the market closure period, saw Chicago's near-term prices rise by 40 cents, and even higher by 10 to 20 cents; Canadian prices rose by 20 to 30 cents in the near term and 10 to 20 cents in the long term. Market sentiment was initially calm due to good weather, but attention was later focused on the market due to the uniformly good prices of miscellaneous grains. Therefore, buying was quite active, and prices rose by 1 to 2 cents immediately. When the market opened in the afternoon, the miscellaneous grain market remained good, and dealers from Dalian and northern regions bought in small quantities, which further boosted market sentiment. This situation is partly a consequence of the currency system and partly due to the depletion of inventories. Therefore, it is difficult to see any loosening before the new wheat crop comes out.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Rises Sharply by Over 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market saw sharp increases in all months due to low inventories and the uncertainty of the new wheat harvest. Market sentiment was bullish due to rising prices of various commodities, and rumors of increased taxes on imported broken rice further exacerbated the situation. As a result, market sentiment rose uniformly, and short sellers started to cover their positions. Prices for all months rose by 5 to 6 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, buying remained strong, and short sellers had no new positions to release, so prices continued to rise. The June contract rose most sharply, by as much as 12 cents, while the others rose by about 10 cents. In this situation, it may be difficult to see any easing in the short term. Spot wheat remained stable, with Shandong Yaowan wheat opening at $5.32 and Hankou wheat at $4.92. Fuxin traded 2,000 bags, and Fufeng traded 1,500 bags of American wheat. Due to the government's favorable harvest estimates and insufficient rainfall in the southwest, short sellers covered their positions, causing prices to rise.</p>
<h3>Tax on Imported Broken Rice Changed to Full Tax, Ke Xian Rice Suddenly Rises by 20-30 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw all grades rise sharply. Due to the activities of hoarders, market sentiment rose uniformly. Furthermore, the increased tax on foreign rice made the situation even more tense. All rice prices rose sharply by 20-30 cents. A total of over 3,200 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,400 bags of Wentai rice, 1,500 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 109 bags of Xiang rice were traded throughout the day, mostly bought by hoarders. Actual sales on the street accounted for only a small portion, it is said.</p>
<p>Imported broken rice used to be subject to only half tax. Yesterday, the authorities announced the collection of full tax, increasing the tax from 75 cents to $1.56. This may make it difficult to import in the future. However, it remains to be seen whether the existing Siamese broken rice and cargo in transit will be subject to the new tax.</p>
<h3>Du Rice is Pulled Up by Ke Xian</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty sources for each gang, with nearly five noon shi of goods. Sales on the street were initially flat, but in the afternoon, it was heard that Ke Xian rose sharply by 30 cents, showing signs of activity. Market conditions improved immediately. Ruohouzao rice prices rose by 10 cents, and Baodao rice also had over 2,000 bags traded from Tianjin Tanggu Yantai, etc., so prices also rose by different amounts. Du Yangjian followed the trend and added a corner, while Yinyuan also tightened.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were thirty-four or five boats from various routes in Hexia. Sales of various goods on the market became more active. Ke Fang shouted for price increases because of the price on producing areas, resulting in higher price and selling. The market price of Bai Geng rice turned tight by about 10 cents, and Baodao rice also tightened by several cents. Yang Du and Ke Jian also showed signs of tightening. Bu Jian was fixed, and Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan also tightened. All other goods remained firm.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Reports Rising, Standard Oil and Soybeans Soar Together</h3>
<p>Temporary Collection of Special Certificates by Grain Bureau</p>
<p>Standard soybean oil, due to telegraph reports from Dalian gradually reporting higher prices, and extremely low inventories in the local port, while sales from various routes are inquiring, there is a shortage of supply on the market. As a result, market sentiment is soaring, with this month's opening price rising by a huge $1, and forward months also rising by 60 to 80 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, buying remained strong, and market prices continued to rise. As a result, this month's price rose by $1, May's price rose by $1.20, June's price rose by 95 cents, July's price rose by 80 cents, August's price rose by 85 cents, and September's price rose by 95 cents. Soybeans also rose due to good telegraph reports from Dalian, with April's price rising by 43 cents and May's price rising by 22 cents. Standard sesame seeds also rose because inventories were depleted, supply was not sustained, and foreign firms had recently taken action to collect, so this month's price also rose by 47 cents and May's price rose by 60 cents. According to last year's soybean and sesame crops, both were poor, and once large firms start selling, market prices easily soar.</p>
<p>After the market prices of standard oil cake and soybeans soared yesterday, the Grain Bureau, in order to prevent unexpected events, followed the usual practice and decided at a board meeting to increase the special certificate margin. The standard oil certificate margin was set at $300, the standard cake at $200, and the standard soybean at $400. As for the spot market, the bullishness of standard prices inevitably pushed sentiment upwards, but trading decreased slightly. Three vehicles of spot beans were traded on Siping Street, with prices rising by 2 cents. Five vehicles of goods in transit were opened, and prices remained unchanged. There were no trades in vehicle beans. Du beans and Sha Huang beans rose by a few cents, with over 1,300 bags traded. Sales from Nanyang and Wentai gangs remained strong, and the market was brisk. Only Changde Factory opened 1,500 pieces of Four-Brand cake, with a price of $2.02. Soybean oil and peanut oil both rose by 20 cents. According to the current trend, the price of standard oil soared because of the few days of market closure, resulting in a fluctuation of about $1. According to the atmosphere of the spot market, it is heard that the Lian city has slightly recovered, and market sentiment is not as frantic as before. Therefore, the overall situation may temporarily stop rising, and the market may fluctuate again later.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Trades at 200 Bales</h3>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<h3>(Fangzheng)</h3>
<p>Although winter green is not as bright and moving as peach and plum, winter green has gone through several springs and autumns and does not change its original color, while peach and plum do not! This seems to symbolize that we should not be proud, because pride can only be a flash in the pan, but cannot be immortal!</p>
<p>When olives are imported for chewing, they feel very astringent and bitter, but after a few minutes, they gradually become sweet and fragrant. This is the best model for us to be human.</p>
<p>Frank Ling once said, "One knows the value of water after the well has dried up." I think this is most appropriate to encourage the young people in the vocational world, because the young people in the vocational world are often dissatisfied with their current position, and even complain about everything. If they lose their jobs, they will recall the days when they were employed.</p>
<p>"The word 'difficult' is only found in the dictionary used by fools." This is Napoleon encouraging people, and I think young people are even more worthy of taking it as a self-encouragement.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Seventy-Year-Old Lad and a Ninety-Year-Old Man</h3>
<p>— Mei Kerong</p>
<p>Peng Zu lived to eight hundred years, Yan Hui lived to thirty-six years. Longevity and early death are different. In the past, people thought that longevity and early death were related to the number of days, but now they attribute it to health preservation. However, the saying of the number of days seems to be vague, and the theory of health preservation is more practical. If a person is good at health preservation, will he not be healthy and long-lived? Conversely, it will lead to premature death. The way of health preservation is based on a righteous heart and a broad heart. The scientific so-called mental health care, muscle resolution, can be seen from the matter of seventy-year-old lads and ninety-year-old men in our county. Ye Xie Town, Songjiang, is a town by the Huangpu River. Boats to the interior must pass through this narrow place. The population is dense. When the Jiazi Qi Lu Incident broke out, the two armies faced each other across the river, and they fought for many days. There are many records in the newspapers, not inferior to the Miao Hang two words of the One Two Eight Incident; that is, the Song Salt General Factory and the audit branch are also located here, and Shanghai people eat salt, which is given to them, so the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang do not know this 鈸. There is a Tiande Hall Pharmacy in the town, and the owner's surname is Shen, named Yu Ru. Last month, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday. According to the age of ninety, it is already rare. It can be recorded that he has four generations in the same hall. The son of the old man, Wei Qing, is now seventy years old. Wei Qing's eldest son, Guo Jun, is forty-nine years old this year. Wei Qing's son, Bing Jun, is thirty-eight years old, and his youngest son, Kui Jun, is also about thirty years old. Guo Jun died early, leaving a daughter named Ju Hua, who is more than twenty years old. Bing Jun's sons, Zeng Shou and Jing Quan, are both more than ten years old. The four generations of grandparents live together and cook together, and they are happy. The ninety-year-old man is physically strong. At present, he still manages the affairs of the store by himself, and is unwilling to let others do the sweeping. He does not need anyone to help him when walking. His method of health preservation is to get up early and sleep early, not to smoke or drink, to eat in moderation, and to abstain from female color after breaking his string at the age of thirty. Is it because of this that he enjoys longevity? The seventy-year-old son is very enthusiastic about social undertakings, repairing bridges and roads, helping orphans and widows, and is always ahead of others. Local people feel that they cannot do without this gentleman. He told people that my Shen family takes not owing debts as a family motto, because if you owe someone and do not repay it, the center condemns it. If you owe someone and want to repay it but cannot, the heart is anxious, and the stimulation is very great, so at the end of the year, there has never been a bill sent. His gentle demeanor, like a spring breeze, and his grandsons Bing Jun and Kui Jun, are straightforward and do not lag behind their fathers and grandfathers. His great-grandsons, Zeng Shou, etc., are now studying. The other day was the old man's birthday, and the people of the whole town thought that at this time, people's hearts were weak, and they usually exhausted their energy and mind, and criticized the gains and losses, as if they were always short of Yan Zi. Now the four generations of grandparents are in the same hall, which is rare, so they went to congratulate each other. After the banquet was opened, there was a custom of toasting. At first, the seventy-year-old man told the guests that the family had strictly ordered him to toast a glass of wine on behalf of the family, followed by Bing Jun, and finally Zeng Shou and Jing Quan. The three generations of family members toasted in succession, and the guests present were envious and praised them, and this small town produced such a person, which is really like the congratulatory couplet of Zong Yulin, the director of the town's public security bureau, "A family with auspicious atmosphere is praised by thousands of families, a seventy-year-old lad and a ninety-year-old man". Wei Qing usually pleases his parents, and although his beard and hair are white, he still pretends to be a child to please his parents, which is similar to the ancient story of the playful Cai Lai Zi, and the ancient and the modern reflect each other.</p>
<h3>Talking about Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Offering bamboo shoots in spring is seen in the Song Dynasty History. Spring shoots are commonly known as Mao shoots. During these March and April months, they emerge from the moss, and their fragrant buds and tender sheaths are most delicious when eaten. I once saw in the Six Yan Zhai Notes a record of the method of picking bamboo shoots, saying, "Pick them from the soil after sunrise, put them in a dense bamboo container, and do not let them see the wind. If they touch the wind, the base will be firm, and if they are soaked in water, the flesh will be hard. If the shell is removed and boiled, the taste will be lost, and if they are cut raw, the tenderness will be lost. If they are picked and left for a long time, they will not be fresh. If they are stored in the wind, they will not be hidden. Removing the shell is not curing, and cleaning them in water is not washing. If they are steamed and boiled for a short time, they will not be cooked. If you know this, you can talk about eating bamboo shoots."</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots can be cooked with meat, and other dishes such as oil-braised bamboo shoots and stir-fried shrimp and bamboo shoots are also very delicious. It is said that "bamboo is most afraid of sesame, and if it touches sesame oil or its residue, it will immediately wilt. Therefore, even if the bamboo shoots are old and hard, they will be soft and delicious with sesame oil." Connoisseurs should know this.</p>
<p>Tiger's Claw Tips are produced in Hangzhou. Gong Ding'an has a poem: "There is a bamboo shoot called Tiger's Claw Tip." The bamboo shoots produced on Sheshan Mountain in Songjiang have the fragrance of orchids. They are one of the Mao bamboo shoots and must be dug up and cooked as soon as they emerge from the soil, otherwise they will be old and the taste will be inferior. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty toured the south, he named Sheshan Mountain the Orchid Bamboo Shoot Mountain. However, if they are transported to other places, they will lose their fragrance overnight. Therefore, Xianqing Ouji says: "Bamboo shoots must be in the mountains and forests. Those produced in the city, no matter how fragrant and fresh, are only the remaining meaning of bamboo shoots. This is the first-class product among vegetable dishes. Fatty sheep and tender pigs are not enough to compare with them. Just cook the bamboo shoots and meat together and put them in one container. People only eat the bamboo shoots and leave the meat, then the meat is fish and the bamboo shoots are bear paws. This is true for those bought in the market, let alone those freshly dug in the mountains."</p>
<p>Xu Koubei once invited Xu Wenchang to eat bamboo shoots, and Wenchang wrote a poem to tease him: "Koubei is as gluttonous as Su Shi, how can he get bamboo shoots to burn the stove in the poor border? I have heard that he quenched his thirst with plums, so he wrote about Longsun Xing Dafu." It is very interesting.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Spring Purification of the Star Society</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>The Star Society has been gathering for fifteen years. There are more than thirty members, and half of them are in Shanghai. Therefore, they held a spring purification ceremony at Guanshengyuan Farm on Qingming Day. Fourteen people arrived as scheduled. Bibo and Lengyue came with their wives, and Hongjiao brought her son. It can be said that the skirts were spread and all ages gathered.</p>
<p>The owner of the garden, Mr. Xi Guansheng, gave candy to each person before leaving, and Mr. Wu Jiren also gave goldfish to the Lengyue couple and Jiang Gongzi, one to exchange for paintings, and the other to rejoice in its gentleness.</p>
<p>I and Mr. Xi each took out a small booklet and asked the participants to write. Lengyue was the most diligent, writing a poem by a Yuan dynasty person in Mei Yu Zhen's painting album. He drew one red and one black goldfish in the Xi book. It seems that he had a strong interest in painting, and brought his pen and ink. However, the time was too short, and it was too far from the city to get white paper, so it seems that he had not fully expressed his painting.</p>
<p>That day was a holiday and a festival, so there were as many men and women as clouds. However, we occupied the Meizhulu, which was like a forbidden area. We talked in a heated manner while drinking, and even though the sound of rain was rustling outside the door, we did not hear it. Later, we saw that the rain had cleared a little, and we asked Lanxin to take a group photo on the lawn. Unfortunately, the light was dim, so I am afraid that it is not very clear. I wonder if people will eventually be able to overcome heaven? Then we visited the order of biscuit manufacturing. The workers were all dressed in white, as if they were entering a hospital, which showed that they were clean. From filtering the powder to putting it into the box, the procedure required seven decisions, and the time was only a few minutes. Its shape is quite like minting coins, and biscuits and coins are solid one and two and two and one.</p>
<p>The Song Mei stood facing the door. Mr. Xi got it from a temple in Hangzhou. It was covered with several green vines, and its posture was ancient and elegant, which was very picturesque. A little is better than many. However, I think we should plant more plums, because Guanshengyuan is famous for its tangerine peel plums, and there must be a forest of fragrant snow to commemorate it. However, there are very few plum blossoms in Shanghai, which is not enough to enhance the international appearance.</p>
<p>I still had some remaining feelings, so I went to Huangjia Garden with Mianyun, Yimei, Lanxin, and the Lengyue couple. Although the buildings were very grand and magnificent, I felt that the atmosphere of gold powder was too strong, which was not as good as the farm's small family style. Or are we sour scholars who have different tastes and are different from the vulgar? There are very strong peonies, known as a hundred-year-old thing. I don't know what color they are. Mianyun said, is it really longer than the Peide Hall in Suzhou? We must come and see them when they are in bloom.</p>
<p>At that time, Duhu resigned due to his son's illness, and I don't know where Su Feng went. Others were in Wumen, in the capital, in Cuidao, and in Dongying. The ends of the earth, how can we express our longing? Perhaps there will be sadness in this literature!</p>
<h3>Daqian Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— (Juan)</p>
<p>The famous painters Zhang Shanzi and Daqian from Sichuan are famous all over the world and are known as the "Two Difficulties." Shanzi is good at painting tigers and calls himself a "Tiger Crazy." Because General Zhu Shaoliang gave him a tiger cub, he made a special trip to Hanzhao to meet him and planned to raise him in the Wangshi Garden in Wuxia. This was once a well-known story. Daqian studied Shi Tao and his works can also be compared with Shi Tao's. Recently, he has been teaching at the Central University, and scholars have flocked to him like water. Now, at the request of his friends in the capital, he will hold a painting exhibition for three days starting on the sixteenth, and will present his proud works to his fellow enthusiasts. It is expected that they will spread quickly in Nanjing. Notice To all contributors: Thank you for your wonderful works in the March Spring and Autumn and Children's Weekly. We are very grateful. The fees have now been settled clearly. Please affix your seal on the receipt and collect it from the accounting office of this museum from 2:00 to 4:00 pm from the 6th to the 10th and from the 16th to the 20th (except Sundays).</p>

<h3>Changing Nest Luan Feng</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Preface: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near the Double Ninth Festival, Seeking Serene Gatherings; Recalling Old Dreams in Linked Pearls, Regretting a Thousand Autumns</p>
<p>You're bound to say, isn't it possible he picked it up somewhere else? And it doesn't have to be today. That's what you should ask. But if he'd gotten it on him earlier, he wouldn't have worn this outfit to the gathering today, precisely because he picked it up after leaving home, and didn't have time to go back and change. And there's a bit of cement stuck to the sole of his shoe, which is from the newly constructed area in front of the post office. Being stained with both mud and paint, he must have gone to the post office. A letter that he personally delivered to the post office before attending the gathering is definitely not an ordinary letter. I couldn't help but clap my hands twice in succession, saying, "The more you guess, the more brilliant it becomes. Whether it's right or wrong, the fact that you speak so logically convinces me completely." He saw that I was listening intently, twirling the autumn leaf in his hand, smiling as if he had guessed something even further. I then asked with a smile, "Do you have any other brilliant theories?" Before he could answer, Lan Chang was already waving from afar, saying, "Everyone's hungry, please come eat." At that time, we followed our host's invitation to the table, temporarily suspending the discussion of this question. After the wine and food, Lan Chang invited me to a corner of the small garden, leading me into a small room. Outside this room were two banana trees and a wisteria trellis, a location of extreme tranquility. The low white walls had two black-painted doors. I had long felt that this place was perfect for a quiet chat. Inside the room there wasn't much furniture, just rattan chairs and tables, with two pots of evergreen plants on a high shelf, and a porcelain jar of goldfish on a low table, and two windows in a row, all with loosely hanging curtains. I first said with a smile, "This place is very elegant; you could invite that Mr. Ruan here for a conversation." Lan Chang said, "He left before the end of the meal." Hearing this, I couldn't help but blush, and asked with a smile, "He doesn't deem me worthy of his trust?" Jian Chang shook his head, saying, "Don't misunderstand. He left all the materials that should have been given to you behind." As he spoke, he placed a cloth-wrapped bundle he had been carrying under his arm on the rattan table in the center, pointing at it and saying, "It's all in here." I said, "Why didn't he see me?" Lan Chang said, "I've known him for almost a year, and he's only been here three times. He's sent two letters in between. He doesn't live in Suzhou. He came by train this afternoon and is rushing back to the train station. He said to me, 'Seeing the way you are, I feel comfortable entrusting you. Please pass this bundle to him.' He also said, 'He still needs these things; please keep them.' He will communicate with you in the future. Didn't I leave the table for a moment just now? It was to talk to him. After he spoke, he immediately took his leave. I didn't even have time to let you know. She's a female teacher, and I couldn't force her to stay, so I had to let her go." I said, "This teacher is truly like a dragon, showing her head but not her tail. Could she be related to something in a book?" Lan Chang had me sit across from him at the rattan table, and then the servant brought tea. (Eight)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Jingzhou and Shashi</h3>
<p>— Wang Canzhi</p>
<p>Jingzhou is located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, serving as the gateway to Sichuan and Hubei. It was a territory fiercely contested by the states of Shu and Wu during the Three Kingdoms period, as recorded in historical texts. However, due to its remote location, the nation has long overlooked it. Last winter, my husband was transferred to take office in this land, and I followed him to the government residence, affording me the opportunity to visit and explore. On the day we embarked on our journey, it coincided with the relocation of the military camp to Yichang. Only the British merchant ship "Xianghe" and the Japanese merchant ship "Danyang" operated between Hankou and Shashi. We decided to travel on the "Xianghe." Unexpectedly, all the dining cabins were already taken by those who acted quickly. As our travel dates were fixed, we could not delay and had to book two official cabins. However, the cabins were dirty and noisy, making it unbearable to stay there all day. The cabin attendants only knew how to demand tips for wine but were unwilling to serve the passengers. The lavatories were located on the lower deck, with the berths of several steerage passengers placed in front of the door, making the stench unbearable. The cabin attendants competed to allocate berths for their personal passengers, leading to quarrels and even physical altercations, causing alarm among the passengers who were at a loss. Foreigners treated the Chinese like pigs and dogs, confining the Chinese to simple official cabins while reserving the luxurious dining cabins for foreigners, maintaining strict boundaries. Passengers in the official cabins could not even stretch their legs to reach the dining cabins. The Chinese people did not know how to value themselves, not only failing to correct their bad habits but also exacerbating them, as if they themselves admitted to being pigs and dogs, further fueling the contempt of others. How shameful!</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day, the ship arrived at Shashi. My husband engaged with the welcoming party, and I disembarked and checked into the Dahua Hotel, reputed to be the largest hotel in the area. However, the walls were stained with water marks, and the doors and windows were crooked, already revealing the aftermath of a flood disaster. We had already had dinner on the ship, but the welcoming party insisted on hosting a reception banquet. Unable to decline, we had to take our seats. My husband sat at a table with the male guests, while I sat at a table with two female guests. As we had not long finished dinner, we were not hungry. I suddenly recalled the line "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine rot; on the road, there are corpses frozen to death," and felt even more unable to swallow.</p>
<p>The chamber where we resided faced a narrow alley. Opposite was an eyeglass and jade shop. In front of the door was a woman selling steamed buns, her clothes soiled. After making the buns, she would often rub her dirty shoes with her hands, and then hand the buns to people, making one want to vomit for three days. By the time the night deepened, the buns were still not sold out. The cold dew and wind made one feel worried for her. The next morning, I stood by the window and took a small look again. Vendors selling vegetables and food gathered in the alley, all dressed in rags and extremely dirty. I wonder if the practitioners of the New Life Movement have seen this? After breakfast, I went to the government office to take over the duties, traveling by car. Except for a few roads in Shashi, the rest were uneven muddy roads, making driving difficult and dangerous. Along the way, we saw two policemen escorting two villagers, carrying placards and parading through the streets. We heard that they were violators of the New Life Movement, hence the public display as a warning. After entering the city, we passed through a narrow street, said to be the most prosperous street in Jiangling. The car could barely pass through, leaving almost no room for pedestrians. Soon, we arrived at the government office, the buildings were spacious, but dilapidated. Entering the room, a musty odor assaulted the senses, making it unbearable. In recent years, the calls for construction have been resounding, yet the administrative organs are still in such condition. How can they present a grand spectacle?</p>
<p>Education in this area is rudimentary, and the atmosphere is closed. Female activists from the coast aim to seek the liberation, freedom, and equality of women. In my humble opinion, Shanghai women have already been influenced by European trends and are moving towards liberation. If they could deeply penetrate the inland, wouldn't their merits be significant?</p>

<h3>My Illness</h3>
<p>— Xing Shu</p>
<p>In the summer of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, ten years ago from now, cholera was epidemic in Shanghai. People died in the morning after falling ill the evening before, causing widespread panic. At that time, I was working as a doctor in an epidemic hospital. Scientific medicine was naturally what I believed in. Because of my belief, I couldn't help but be skeptical: skepticism is different from stubbornness; skepticism is the attitude of a scientist. After skepticism, perhaps belief will become even stronger. Although everyone in the hospital, both superiors and subordinates, forty or fifty people in total, complied with the hospital director's order and received three injections of cholera vaccine to prevent infection, I was somewhat skeptical about this method of prevention. I resolutely refused to be injected, with a sentence stuck in my bones, to see if I would be infected after all. Facts are the most eloquent. Within three months, in the entire hospital, uniquely, only I was infected with cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, muscle cramps in the legs, ... the symptoms were cholera, the stool bacterial examination was cholera, the evidence was conclusive, cholera was confirmed. The illness was critical, almost fatal. Fortunately, I quickly underwent saline injection and various legitimate treatments, pulling me back from the gates of hell, without seeing Yama. "Goodness gracious," how dangerous! "Skepticism," "the attitude of a scientist," almost cost me my life. From then on, I dared not underestimate the power of cholera prevention injections, and my faith became even stronger.</p>
<p>The efficacy of cholera prevention injections had long been proven by scholars to be without error. I had also long understood this, so my willingness to risk my own body to experiment was what is called "self-experimentation." "Self-experimentation" is something that many of the sages of the medical world have done, sacrificing their own health, even sacrificing their lives, in order to clarify the facts and put them into practice; in the eyes of our esteemed countrymen, it seems truly foolish and idiotic. It must be understood that world civilization and academic progress owe nothing to the foolish.</p>
<p>Based on my experience and clinical observations, cholera prevention injections are indeed effective, without a doubt. Time flies like an arrow. In the blink of an eye, spring has passed and summer has arrived. The cholera epidemic season is here again. I advise everyone not to be skeptical. Safety first. If you are afraid of contracting cholera, please go to a doctor to get three shots of vaccine, ensuring that you can spend a safe summer.</p>
<p>Three years ago, there was a period when I suffered greatly from insomnia because of something (unrelated to fame, fortune, or women). This was due to overstimulation of the nerves. My shallow life experience, lack of self-cultivation, insufficient reading, and unclear understanding of principles are also reasons that make nerves easily irritated. I remember that at that time, I tossed and turned in bed, unable to close my eyes, with a flood of thoughts, extremely distressed. Being a doctor myself, of course I tried all kinds of sleeping pills, but they had no special effect. Later, I had a great awakening, seeing the matter clearly, and letting go of it. Strangely, the insomnia that had lasted for more than a month was cured without medication. I was able to sleep through the night until dawn, and it has been like that ever since. I talked a lot about my insomnia in the article "Cannot Sleep," so I don't want to repeat it here, lest I annoy the reader. In short, if insomnia is not caused by illness, but is nervous insomnia, it can be treated by one's own psychological effects; the power of medicine is truly limited. Perhaps you cannot fully believe what I alone say, so I am now excerpting the words of Dr. Long Yuying for your reference. Dr. Long suffered from lung disease and was recuperating in the hospital. He developed insomnia. What was his treatment method? Please see below: "I slept in Xiangya Hospital for a full six months. The most painful things at that time were two: the first was not being able to sleep at night, worrying about aggravating the illness. Who knew that the more I worried, the less I could sleep, often opening my eyes and watching the dawn. ... Every time I couldn't sleep, I would take sleeping pills. All the sleeping pills were used up, but I still couldn't sleep. A few times I took morphine, in heavy doses, so heavy that I couldn't lift my limbs and couldn't open my eyelids; but my mind was still clear, I knew who was in the room, who was walking, I knew everything clearly, but I still couldn't sleep. Then I was truly at a loss; so I steeled myself, if I can't sleep, I won't worry about it. If I don't sleep tonight, I can sleep tomorrow. If I don't sleep tomorrow, I can sleep tomorrow night. ... Since I made this decision, every night I effortlessly entered a very sweet dream. From this, it can be known that nine out of ten cases of insomnia are due to mental effects; if the mental aspect does not receive sufficient comfort, no matter what sleeping pills you take, they will be useless. This is my personal experience. If there are people with insomnia, why not try my method? ..." Dr. Long's view coincides with mine: "Great minds think alike." Is that what it means?</p>
<p>I also suffered from malaria once. During the period when it was attacking, alternating chills and fever made one feel the vicissitudes of life, which was very uncomfortable. Immediately, I used an appropriate amount of quinine, and took it internally for many days according to the prescribed time, clearing it up in one fell swoop and never having it recur. Now there are many people who are clever, knowing that when malaria attacks, they take quinine internally, but they cannot follow the law in terms of dosage and time. The medicine does not work when taken, or it recurs, but they complain that quinine has no effect, which is truly wronged and unjustified. Although malaria is still very prevalent in some areas, harming rural areas and reducing production, the responsibility for relief rests with the health authorities; I do not want to express many opinions, to avoid troubling the hand of the printer and spoiling the jujube pears.</p>
<h3>World View of Tuberculosis Statistics (5)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The condition of black people suffering from tuberculosis must be observed in various different ways, such as in their old homes in Africa, or in the territory, or living elsewhere away from Africa. According to the observation of Keines, it was found that the residents of East Africa had absolutely no tuberculosis, and it was also confirmed that the indigenous residents were not infected with tuberculosis in their childhood, but only after adulthood, and only when they left their hometowns, such as going to the coast or cities to work, could they be infected.</p>
<p>In one hundred and three adults and fifty-one children, the Pirquet test was used, and it was found that ten adults had a positive reaction, and only one child had a positive reaction. The tuberculosis of black people initially has no long incubation period, and its cure is mostly due to rich nutrition and returning to their hometowns. Therefore, the spread of tuberculosis in the interior of Africa is initially not a great danger. In French territories, the black people spit everywhere due to their habits, so the rate of infection is very wide. The source of infection is mostly due to poor living and nutrition of European soldiers and their residents. The spread of tuberculosis also varies in various territories. The percentage of children under the age of fifteen who are infected varies greatly from six to fifty%, and the course of the disease in adults is no different from that in white people. The percentage of those who are infected varies greatly from seven, eight to twenty-five%, and in places with convenient railway transportation, fifty to seventy% are infected. It is permissible to say that the infection is very widespread in western Africa. The climate of Sudan and the Sahara seems to have a tendency to prevent the development of tuberculosis. In this area, white people and people with mixed blood are more likely to be infected with tuberculosis than black people. In this sense, it is difficult to generalize the tuberculosis infection of the species.</p>
<p>In the recent century, most of the black people have migrated to the Americas and have become a race of Sclavs. In the United States of America, according to Qpie's calculation, for every ten thousand residents, self-people have seven point two deaths, and colored people have twenty-three point three deaths, which is more than three times that of white people. According to Mr. Li's Maple, there is a racial sensitivity, and of course there are other factors such as public health. Moreover, it is not easy to infect tuberculosis in childhood, but after the age of fifteen to twenty, the infection is more common. In other words, black people are inversely proportional to white people, that is, black people are more easily infected than white people after adulthood, but the opposite is true in childhood. Moreover, the course of the disease is also completely different between white people and black people. For example, white people are mostly chronic and develop into scar formation, but this is not the case in black people, who are mostly acute and poor.</p>
<p>In the city of Di Quluo, according to Chadwick's statistics, from 1923 to 1932, it was found that the increase in tuberculosis among black people was as follows: in 1907, the mortality ratio of white people to black people was 7.0% and 13.7%, but later the mortality rate of white people gradually decreased, while the mortality rate of black people increased instead. In 1932, the ratio was 6.1% and 2.8%. The reason for the increase in mortality is of course due to poor living conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of racial sensitivity to tuberculosis, Bogen has studied it and believes that the relationship of race is extremely great. For example, the death rate of black people in the Americas and Africa is higher than that of white people. Among these ethnic groups, very few children suffer from tuberculosis. At this time, a kind of resistance to tuberculosis is developed, and it is not easy to be infected with tuberculosis. If they are infected, most of them will soon die.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Syphilis</h3>
<p>— Written and translated by Doctor of Medicine Yamauchi Tamotsu</p>
<p>Syphilis is a disease that hinders the progress of human society the most viciously and severely. Everyone knows that its harmful effects not only affect the patients themselves but also harm future generations and poison society. The increasing number of unethical elements that destroy social morality is rooted in this.</p>
<p>I once examined one hundred and twenty congenital syphilis patients, of whom fifty-four had impaired intellectual development and two were completely idiotic. I also examined blind and deaf people. Among one hundred blind people, thirty-four were congenital syphilis patients, and among one hundred deaf people, twenty were congenital syphilis patients. Infants born to parents with syphilis mostly die after a few months, and even if they survive, they are all mentally retarded and deformed.</p>
<p>Tracing the marks of syphilis accelerating the extinction of human races and nations, as far as Africa, India, and as close as Mongolia, the fierceness of its invasion is enough to make us tremble.</p>
<p>During my travels in northern Manchuria, I received a report in Zhalantun that "in the conscription examination of Mongolian strongmen, sixty out of one hundred were syphilis patients."</p>
<p>The harm of this disease is also fierce in Japan. Let me give two or three examples as proof.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of my clinic over the past ten years, among thirteen thousand patients, as many as 60% had a history of syphilis infection. Most of the patients who seek medical treatment at my clinic belong to the intellectual class, and it is already like this. In addition, due to their occupation and environment, the syphilis infection rate is said to be as high as 100%, which is not an exaggeration. It can be seen that the fierceness of syphilis invasion is supernatural.</p>
<p>Although the country relies on various laws or other means to prevent the spread of syphilis, the effect is actually equal to zero. The world is unconsciously in a state of destruction, which is why I cannot but use an active and fundamental method of syphilis prevention injection to save mankind from this tragedy.</p>
<p>The medicine used in the syphilis prevention injection is a metal. This metal has the property of enhancing acidification. After the injection, it can settle in the body tissues, using its acidification effect to destroy the pathogens that will invade the tissues and also eliminate the pathogens that have already parasitized in the body. This is a kind of alloy method. The prevention method based on this ideal is also a treatment method at the same time.</p>
<p>Lead has weak toxicity, but its effect of enhancing acidification is very significant. If lead salts are injected into the body, they are reduced in the tissues to become fine granular lead, distributed and deposited in the tissues throughout the body. Sometimes, in patients with specific constitutions, granular rashes appear all over the body within ten hours after the injection, itching intolerably. This is clear evidence of the rapid distribution and deposition of lead in the tissues throughout the body. The degree of concentration varies depending on the tissue and the patient's constitution, but it will reach the highest point within three or four days after the injection. After that, although it will gradually be excreted in the urine, its effect of enhancing acidification deposited in the body may be preserved for at least several months. The existence of itchy rashes for six months after the injection in people with specific constitutions is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>E. Sonnenberg injected prostitutes in Łódź, Poland, with 0.1 cm of lead every week and completely prevented syphilis infection for a year. Also, Lieba Jiti at the Pasteur Institute in France injected animals weighing one kilogram with 0.03 cm of lead and completely prevented syphilis for six months.</p>
<p>The achievements of the above two are commendable. However, when it is actually applied, there are still many points that should be considered. For example, it is difficult to give long-term injections to prostitutes and other employed people. A large amount of lead must be injected at one time to complete the necessary amount of lead injection within a short period. According to many years of experience, lead can be injected in the following way, and no worrisome side effects have been encountered. (Lead agent uses Casbis "Bayer") The necessary total amount of lead injection for syphilis prevention is more than 0.03 cm of lead for those weighing one kilogram, and the prevention period is six months. The patient's constitution, symptoms, and environment must be considered one by one, and the single injection amount should be set to 0.5 cm of lead or less.</p>
<p>When the total amount of lead injection per kilogram of body weight exceeds 0.03 cm, the prevention period can be extended, and no side effects will occur.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Sand Ginseng Adenophra verticillata, Fisch, var.</p>
<p>typica, Regel.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows naturally in the mountains and fields, a perennial herb. The stem is 30-60 cm tall, rarely up to one meter. The leaves are whorled, alternate, or opposite, and vary in shape. The lower leaves are generally oblong-oval, with serrated edges, and the upper leaves are linear or lanceolate, all green. The terminal raceme is a panicle, and in autumn, it blooms with pale purple or white bell-shaped flowers. The apple is obovate.</p>
<p>(Drug) Sand Ginseng Radix Adenophorae Verticillatae is collected from its roots and dried. This product is a long fusiform or cylindrical shape, 20 cm long, 2 cm thick, curved and uneven in shape. The surface is light yellow, with obvious ring-shaped horizontal wrinkles. The cross-section is white, fibrous, and extremely light and hollow. The taste is mild and slightly bitter.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The roots contain a saponin.</p>
<p>(Medicinal) The old saying: Sand ginseng can be used as an expectorant. A daily dose of 8 cm is used in decoctions.</p>
<p>Gourd family Cucurbitaceae</p>
<p>Melon Cucumis Melo, L. Melone (German) Melon (English)</p>
<p>(Plant) Can be cultivated everywhere, an annual vine. The leaves are alternate, long-stalked, and palmately lobed, with unevenly toothed edges. Monoecious. In summer, it blooms with 5-lobed yellow sympetalous flowers, the male flowers with long stalks and the female flowers with short stalks. The fruit is long-oval.</p>
<p>(Drug) Melon Stalk Calix Melo is made by drying the unripe stalk.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The effective ingredient of melon stalk is Elaterin C20H28O, a crystalline bitter substance.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) Elaterin has an emetic and slightly purgative effect when taken internally. It is ineffective if injected subcutaneously or intravenously. Vomiting is caused by the stimulation of sensory nerves in the stomach, which reflexively excites the vomiting center. Giving 0.02 cm or more of Elaterin to a dog weighing I kilogram causes violent vomiting, leading to death due to paralysis of the respiratory center. Intravenous injection of 2.5 mg of Elaterin per kilogram of body weight in rabbits</p>
<p>(Medicinal) Old prescriptions: Melon stalk is an effective emetic, used to treat food poisoning, cholera, etc. The daily dose is I24 cm, ground into powder for internal use.</p>

<p>The above is made into a powder, with one dose taken at a time.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A on Dental Knowledge (28)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 36) How should tartar be removed?</p>
<p>Answer: Tartar is a very hard, stone-like thin layer that adheres tightly to the teeth. It cannot be removed by brushing. People who do not pay attention to oral hygiene will naturally have a mouth full of scaly patches. Even those who brush their teeth regularly often have this dirty-colored tartar attached to the gaps between their teeth and on the inside surfaces. The only way to remove it is to have a dentist perform a dental cleaning. Dentists have specialized instruments that can completely scrape away the tartar and dirt, restoring the teeth to their clean, white beauty. During a dental cleaning, dental problems can also be detected, such as early cavities, which can be filled in time to prevent them from becoming serious later. Therefore, surgical dental cleaning is a worthwhile investment. Most Europeans and Americans have their teeth cleaned every six months. Chinese people are now gradually becoming aware of its benefits, and more and more people are asking dentists to clean their teeth, which is a good sign for dental disease prevention.</p>
<p>(Question 137) Will surgical dental cleaning, which involves scraping away tartar, damage the teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: I often hear patients raise this question, and I suspect that many people in society have this doubt as well. In fact, the enamel will not be damaged by dental cleaning. As I mentioned earlier, enamel is very hard and extremely resistant to abrasion. It is like a layer of enamel on a porcelain basin. Although it cannot withstand knocks, it is not afraid of being scraped. Don't believe it? You can try it with a knife on porcelain. If dental cleaning would damage the teeth, it would certainly not occupy such a prominent position in the field of scientific dentistry.</p>
<p>Section 4: Food Selection</p>
<p>(Question 138) What is the relationship between diet and dental disease?</p>
<p>Answer: An unsuitable diet, coupled with a poor lifestyle, will make teeth unhealthy. No matter how much attention you pay to hygiene, teeth are still prone to decay. If the diet is good, the teeth's resistance can be increased, making them strong and durable. The results of repeated trials and surveys in foreign countries have shown that diet can affect the health of our teeth. They gave children in a school a reasonable diet, and the statistics showed that very few cavities occurred among the entire student body. According to the experience of American dentist Dr. Bu, in the industrial area of Massachusetts, the children of poor workers suffered from severe tooth decay and suppuration in their mouths due to poor diet and lack of nutrients, often leaving only tooth roots. Compared with the children in other wealthy urban areas, the difference in quality was very large. Therefore, the issue of diet has become the most interesting area of research in modern preventative dentistry.</p>

<h3>Chronic Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Ju Ru)</p>
<p>Chronic gonorrhea is the prolonged and persistent manifestation of the late-stage symptoms of acute urethral gonorrhea. The inflammation is limited to a certain area. It manifests six to eight weeks after infection. The causes of this condition include repeated acute episodes, unhealthy habits, inappropriate treatment, physical or local deformities, weakness, premature cessation of injections, overly irritating injection solutions, or prolonged use. It can also be caused by a fondness for alcohol and promiscuity, or by excessive exercise. The symptoms include a constant flow of thin, pus-like fluid. The symptoms fluctuate, causing delayed healing. Objective symptoms include a small amount of pus-like fluid leaking from the urethral opening, but sometimes it can only be detected by squeezing the area with a finger. The urine often contains a small amount of fine threads, known as gonorrheal threads or urethral threads. The condition may sometimes heal, but sometimes there is a large amount of pus discharge. In some special cases, abstinence from alcohol and sex can worsen the discharge. Subjective symptoms are mild, and urination is not painful. Occasionally, there may be slight inflammation and burning in the navicular fossa, bulbous urethra, or prostate gland. The disease may also affect the perineum, anus, or testicles. If the disease invades the deep part of the prostate gland, urination may cause spasms and severe pain in the urethra. The duration of the condition varies greatly, generally coming and going intermittently. After several weeks or months, the pus discharge becomes minimal, and the condition appears to be completely healed. However, factors such as intercourse, excessive drinking, overwork, or catching a cold can cause the pus to become more abundant and thicker, and then subside again after a few days. This cycle of waxing and waning leads to a very slow recovery. Complications include urethral stricture, cystitis, epididymitis, arthritis, and so on. There are many ways to treat this stubborn chronic gonorrhea. Among them, the simplest and most effective method, according to both Chinese and Western medical practitioners, is to take "Gonadoten" internally. Each box costs only two dollars. Compared to years of medical treatment and exorbitant expenses, it is truly a case of "a miss is as good as a mile." Therefore, "Gonadoten" is nothing short of a shortcut for those suffering from gonorrhea. The sole distributor is Tongren Western Drugstore at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Scabies</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Qiuyuan)</p>
<p>Scabies is caused by mites, and the itching is severe, especially when warm in bed. The affected person scratches constantly and cannot sit or lie still. Scabies outbreaks are most common in the spring. It is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. If left untreated for several days, it can spread throughout the body and eventually affect the entire family. Treatment should not be delayed. Scabies is not difficult to treat, but improper treatment often leads to prolonged illness lasting three to five years. Hence the saying "three-year itch," which vividly describes its persistence. The so-called scabies mites live in tunnels under the skin. Small blisters and black dots appear along the path of these tunnels. Therefore, scabies medication must penetrate directly into the tunnels to eradicate the mites from their habitat. People suffering from scabies are often from the lower social classes and have limited financial resources. Therefore, scabies medication should not be expensive. However, some imported products on the market sell for as much as three or four dollars, which is prohibitive for many. The "Ganlu" lotion produced by Tongren Western Drugstore at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, sells for only one dollar per bottle. It has extremely strong bactericidal power. Whether it is scabies, ringworm, eczema, or sores, only one drop is needed to stop the itching and kill the mites. The disease can be completely cured with less than one bottle. The efficacy is so rapid, and the price is far less expensive than imported products. It is truly good news for patients.</p>
<h3>Experiment Report on Mian Li – Eliminating Acne Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Acne is just a minor skin ailment and does not cause any major harm to the body. However, one's appearance is extremely important. When interacting with others, politeness is paramount. Acne often occurs for many years continuously, causing constant pain and itching. This can be very embarrassing. Last year, the author developed acne on the nose, forehead, and face. Some said it was due to heat in the blood, while others said it was a natural part of development. However, no method could remove it. Recently, a friend told me that he had completely cured his acne with "Mian Li" from Tongren Western Drugstore in Shanghai. So I bought a bottle to try it. After applying it for a week, I was surprised to see that the acne disappeared without a trace. I spent the price of a bottle of face powder and found this incredibly effective medicine. It is truly worthwhile and commendable. I know that seven or eight out of ten people suffer from acne. So I wrote about my experiment to contribute to the public. (Contribution from Tian Nanping, Tunxi)</p>
<h3>Dysmenorrhea and Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Xue Xin)</p>
<p>Menstruation is a physiological mechanism and usually does not require special treatment. However, it is often accompanied by menstrual pain and can easily lead to various diseases due to unhealthy habits. Therefore, during menstruation, it is essential to maintain hygiene to protect one's health. During menstruation, the vulva should be cleaned regularly because menstrual blood adhering to the vulva and thighs can easily become corrupted, leading to inflammation not only in that area but also in the uterus and vagina. During menstruation, the vulva should be washed with lukewarm water two or three times a day. Menstrual pads should be changed daily and made of soft gauze and cotton. Bathing should be avoided during menstruation, and the body and mind should be kept especially calm. All exercise and mental overexertion should be avoided. Intercourse during menstruation is very harmful. The above methods are simple and superficial, but they must be taken seriously. Dysmenorrhea is a common ailment among weak women, and the pain is particularly severe. For treatment, take "Haolipeng" tablets sold by Tongren Western Drugstore at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai. They are extremely effective and surpass other general pain relievers for dysmenorrhea. Each bottle costs two dollars. As for leukorrhea, even more women suffer from this condition. In addition to the common simple leukorrhea, there is also leukorrhea mixed with gonococci. This condition, like dysmenorrhea, can be a major obstacle to fertility if left untreated. For the treatment of leukorrhea, take "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and use "External Leukorrhea Medicine" at the same time. These two medications are also sold exclusively by Tongren Western Drugstore in Shanghai. Each type costs two dollars. Following the instructions, all hidden ailments will be eliminated. For those with deficiency leukorrhea, painful and frequent urination, vaginal itching, profuse leukorrhea, damp-heat pouring downward, and frequent bowel movements, the effects are even more rapid. All of the above are common diseases and effective treatments for women. Please do not disregard this article.</p>

<h3>Experiment Report on Mian Li – Curing Freckles and Making a Happy Marriage</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that "Mian Li" can treat freckles and acne. However, it is an unexpected and wonderful story that "Mian Li" can lead to marriage. This concerns my cousin, Ms. Ma. I know the details, so I am writing about it. My cousin may think I am being meddlesome. Ms. Ma is a student at a girls' high school in this city. She is only eighteen years old, intelligent and beautiful. She is still unmarried. Ms. Ma usually likes to dress up, but the only imperfection is the many freckles on her nose and cheeks. I used to tease her, saying, "What a beautiful jade, but it's a pity it has a few blemishes." She considered it a great shame and tried every means to treat it but to no avail. Ms. Ma has a male friend, Mr. Liu, who is an artist. They learn from each other and regard each other as beneficial friends. At first, they did not have any romantic feelings. Mr. Liu knew that Ms. Ma deeply hated her freckles, so he paid close attention to it. He happened to hear his friend talk about the amazing effects of "Mian Li" and was delighted. So he bought two bottles and gave them to Ms. Ma. Ms. Ma was as happy as if she had found a treasure. After applying it for less than a month, the freckles were completely removed, and her face became even more delicate than before. Because of this incident, Ms. Ma has developed a deeper feeling for her friend, Mr. Liu. A few days before Tomb Sweeping Day this year, they even obtained the consent of their parents, and their engagement announcement has already been seen in the newspaper. A happy marriage was quickly made. Could it be that "Mian Li" served as the matchmaker? (Contribution from Zhang Xinyuan, this city)</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Stomach Pain: An Experiment</h3>
<p>— (Peng De Qin Bin)</p>
<p>Overeating and gluttony easily injure the stomach, leading to indigestion and belching. If left untreated for a long time, the stomach will experience severe pain. Taking soda and other medications can provide temporary relief, but the pain always recurs after a short period. Many Chinese women do not exercise and have an uncontrolled diet, so stomach problems are common. Xizi's clutching her heart was nothing but stomach pain. Common people do not understand medical principles and often mistake stomach pain for heart pain. This is a serious error. In today's world, effective medicines are emerging, and "Weibiling" is one of them. Taking this stomach medicine not only eliminates the pain but also prevents it from recurring. This has been tried and tested repeatedly.</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. Liu, had been suffering from stomach pain for a long time. Various medications were ineffective. After taking one box of "Weibiling," his chronic illness was cured. "Weibiling" sells for only one dollar per box. It is sold at Tongren Western Drugstore at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai. I believe that there are countless people suffering from stomach pain like my relative. If they could take this effective medicine earlier, they would suffer less pain. Therefore, I am writing this simple article to provide guidance to those suffering from this disease.</p>

<p>Many Years of Stomach Trouble</p>
<p>My father has suffered from stomach trouble for many years. The reason is that he was addicted to alcohol when he was young. Although he quit later, symptoms such as stomach pain and indigestion have accumulated for a long time and have not been cured. Although he has consulted doctors and taken medication, it still flares up often. Therefore, I am writing to ask for a good self-treatment method so that he can take it regularly. If it can cure the root cause, I will be forever grateful. (Wang Mingqi asks)</p>

<p>Newly Contracted Soft Chancre</p>
<p>In a moment of excitement, I became intimate with a prostitute and became careless. Unexpectedly, two days later, I developed a soft chancre with swelling, pain, and discharge. I don't know what to do. I would like to ask if there is a good internal medicine that can kill this disease, besides directly seeking medical treatment. I think this disease is inevitable for many who indulge in prostitution. If there is a good treatment, it will save more than just me. (Name withheld asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) When gonorrhea is newly contracted, it is easier to cure if you seek medical treatment and take medication properly than if it becomes chronic. You can purchase and take the gonorrhea medicine "Gonadoten" pills, which are very effective.</p>
<p>Please Introduce Again</p>
<p>Thank you for your previous advice to use "Mian Li" to treat freckles. It has been very effective for the past half month. Now there are no more freckles to be found. I have used only two bottles.

<h3>Editor's Remarks</h3>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>Recently, we have received dozens of letters from readers reporting their experiences with "Mian Li." Some describe its effectiveness in treating freckles, while others describe its miraculous effects in treating acne. Others praise its ability to moisturize the skin. Everyone agrees that the medicine is effective. However, the space in each issue of this publication is limited, so we can only publish them gradually. In the future, if there are any experimental reports on various new medicines, we hope that readers will continue to send them to us to benefit the public. This would be a great service.</p>
<p>"Ganlu" lotion is truly the ideal special skin medicine in our minds. It enjoys a great reputation and is known to everyone. Whether it is long-term ringworm, newly developed scabies, or any kind of skin moisture and itching, it is effective with just one drop. The medicine's contribution to the medical field is also indispensable.</p>
<p>Talking Words</p>
<h3>Blood and Tears Record of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>"Three households can destroy Qin" is the most brilliant inspiration in Chinese history. Some pessimistic disappointers say about the current future of China, either "China will not perish, there is no justice" or China is really an unrescueable country. This is very correct when it comes to Chinese like Yin Rugeng. If China relies on this kind of people to save the country, the result is really "China will not perish, there is no justice," there is nothing else to say. But Chinese people are not all Yin Rugeng after all. The Yin Rugeng type are only a very small number. There are many, many Yang Amao (the carter who died in the Shanghai War). In short, Chinese people are not all "pigs", they are conscious, spiritual, pain falls on them, and they instinctively know to eliminate this pain. Many, many Yang Amao in China are born with the fate and nature to be responsible for eliminating pain. This nature is still depressed in the corner, in the box, to be available at any time. Therefore, in their view, contrary to pessimistic disappointmentists, China will never perish, and the various pains they bear will always be eliminated one day.</p>
<p>This can be used to talk about the Volunteer Army of the Northeast. The name Volunteer Army of the Northeast has continued to exist for five years since the September 18th Incident in 1931. At first, this name was very familiar to the people in Guannei. Donations, condolences, and even articles and books specifically about the Volunteer Army of the Northeast, one by one, in response to the people in Guannei who were particularly enthusiastic about the name Volunteer Army of the Northeast, batches of them appeared on the bookstalls, earning the righteous indignation and tears of many readers, and also earning a lot of readers' money. But since then, the name Volunteer Army of the Northeast has gradually been neglected by the people in Guannei, and finally eliminated. Books and articles dedicated to the Volunteer Army of the Northeast can no longer be found on bookstalls in magazines. The newspapers no longer have long news about the Volunteer Army, and even occasional fragments of news about the Volunteer Army no longer attract people's attention. But the Volunteer Army of the Northeast, still silent, buried their heads in the ice and snow, suffering from hunger and cold, and fought a more difficult war of resistance against the enemy. They still only know that this is their only way to survive.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, there are still 500,000 people in the Volunteer Army of the Northeast. Another message, a primary school in the Northeast, several people were arrested and killed for secretly organizing a national salvation group. Also, the Japanese puppet army recruited supplementary troops in Changchun, but many patriotic young people did not respond, so the number was very small. Another message, a girl in Changchun, galloped across the battlefield and died for the country. Similar fragment records are really endless. Regardless of whether the Guannei people turn a blind eye to these bloody and tearful struggles, the arduous resistance of the Volunteer Army of the Northeast has always continued and developed, telling us that in addition to Zheng Xiaoxu, Zhao Xinbo, etc., there are still a large number of Yang Amao in the Northeast!</p>
<h3>Swallow</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>This situation, rather than saying that we went to school to study, I think it is more accurate to say that we went to listen to chatting; because our teacher was more happy and energetic when telling stories than when teaching. Naturally, this was what we wanted in that time—</p>
<p>That spring, a pair of swallows suddenly came to organize a new small family on the second beam in the school. From then on, in addition to playing and listening to stories, we watched them fly out and fly back in pairs, flying around and chirping in the room: they were really like a newlywed couple, spending their sweet years inseparable.</p>
<p>But after a few days, we no longer saw them coming and going in pairs; we often only saw one going out, while the other hid in the nest to guard it. The one who went out came back soon, and then the one hiding in the nest would chirp happily, as if everyone was warmly consoling and telling each other. After about half a month - the pair of little things suddenly flew in and out the same as before, but their time out no longer seemed to be so long, and when they came back, they still brought something in their mouths to the nest.</p>
<p>As the days passed, four tender yellow beaks were found on the edge of the nest. Whenever they flew back from outside, the nest would be noisy with squeaks; at the same time, we could see four beaks opening wide and wriggling, revealing the purple-red inner layer, which was very beautiful. We watched them feed them like a mother feeding her own children every day, they took care of them more sensibly, they brought food to feed them, and then carried the dung they pulled out to the outside; this hard work and labor was as great and respectable as human parents.</p>
<p>Gradually, they were able to wander to the edge of the nest, and they were all covered in a beautiful blue feather coat and chrysanthemum-red caps; they were lively and very beautiful.</p>
<p>One day, when the teacher was intoxicated in the clouds and smoke, and we also gained absolute freedom, everyone launched a strange idea - taking advantage of the old swallows not being there, Little Lai Pi first went to the courtyard to shoulder a long bamboo pole, and easily picked at the beam, that small family that they had built with mud and stems for a few days and thought was beautiful was destroyed, and at the same time, four young swallows also fell to the brick floor. After the young swallows fell to the ground, everyone competed to throw and play with them. After not much time, the four poor little lives were finally sent away by us. Later, when the old swallows returned and could not find their home, and could not see their children, they screamed mournfully on the eaves and between the beams, as if cursing the cruelty and ruthlessness of mankind, but at this time we not only had no sympathy, but also used bamboo poles to drive them away; finally, when the teacher asked us, we only said that the kittens ate them, and the nest was destroyed, so the matter was lightly covered up.</p>
<p>- How cruel we were at this time! I thought to myself silently, but even if I wanted to go back to that cruel era now, it is impossible. (End)</p>
<h3>The Carpenter's Son</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Little Flower returned home, put his schoolbag on the small table made by his father from leftover wood, and went alone to the riverbank behind the door.</p>
<p>Little Flower’s father was a carpenter who started work early in the morning and didn't return home until sunset. His mother spent the whole year with her hands immersed in buckets helping people wash clothes. Yet, there was a reason why Little Flower had the happiness of studying in this poor family: Last summer, his father went to the county elementary school to repair the buildings, and Little Flower often went to the school to deliver meals when his mother couldn’t spare her hands. The first time he stepped into that happy paradise, he saw the children wearing neat uniforms learning military drills on the playground, and he didn't want to leave. Moreover, he asked his mother for the job of delivering meals, and every day he learned their military drills in a corner of the playground, sometimes even secretly listening to lectures under the classroom window. One day, when work was over, he held his father's hand, singing the song "Advance, advance, Chinese soldiers..." as they walked past the principal's office. The principal noticed him and allowed him to be a free student, coming to school every day.</p>
<p>Thus, Little Flower became a student of the county elementary school, wearing that kind of short-sleeved, short-trousered uniform. His father was even happier than his son. In his eyes, the principal was as great as an emperor. Now that the principal had taken a liking to his son and made him a free student, he thought it was time to turn his life around. A carpenter with a son in the county elementary school—this was glorious history!</p>
<p>During breaks at the construction site, he chewed on cheap cigarettes and told his companions, "Blind Zhang was right. He always said that I was born with the destiny of a nobleman. Being a carpenter must mean there's a treasure suppressing bad luck." He emphasized the word "treasure" especially, as if a storyteller was creating suspense, and he squinted his eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>Ma Gong, the stableman, imitating his tone, patted his thigh with his fist and tilted his head, saying, "Humph, do you know what that treasure is? It's my good boy, Little Flower!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Nora (21)</h3>
<p>— Illustration by Wan Chao Chen, Explanation by Xin Xin</p>
<p>Nora came out in casual clothes and said calmly: Torvald, sit down and let's have a good talk. In these eight years, have you ever loved me? You just thought it was fun to be in love with me. At home, I was my father's "plaything child," and here with you, I am your "plaything wife." I am now incapable of anything; it's all your fault.</p>
<p>Helmer anxiously: Nora, what are you saying?</p>
<p>Nora: I'm leaving immediately—I still have a responsibility to myself. Now I want to learn; I want to see if it was me who was wrong or the world.</p>
<p>Helmer: Nora, you're sick; you're talking deliriously from a fever.</p>
<p>Nora: I have never had such a clear day in my life as tonight. I endured for eight years, and tonight, a "miracle" happened. I thought you would certainly step forward and say to him: "You can publish this matter, I did this!" But what you did was nothing like the man I wanted to marry. Then you got scared—you were scared not for me, but entirely for yourself—and then you pretended that nothing had happened. I remained your little lark, your plaything.</p>
<p>Helmer: I am willing to endure poverty and hardship for you, but no man in the world is willing to sacrifice his own reputation for the woman he loves.</p>
<p>Nora: Thousands upon thousands of women in the world have sacrificed their reputations for men.</p>

<p>Wealthy Gentleman… Ma Ling</p>
<p>Traveling Merchant in the Snow</p>
<p>One morning, with heavy snow falling: "Buy domestic toothpaste and snow cream!", "Patriotic compatriots, buy domestic toothpaste and snow cream!" This calm voice, carried by the cold wind, entered the warm house, interrupting a conversation between a mother and child. The mother told the child to go and buy the toothpaste from the peddler, and as they talked, the mother discovered that the peddler was a fellow villager, so they talked even more!</p>
<p>But you probably don’t know it yet, do you? Not only are they fellow villagers, but let me tell you! They are also a couple! You must be surprised, but it’s not strange at all. It turns out that the mother, ten years ago, was a vibrant young girl, and the peddler was a handsome young man! They were classmates in the same school, and they loved each other. Later, her family was impoverished due to the tyranny of the warlords. Of course, she had to stop studying, and her mother arranged for her to marry a section chief of the Jilin Salt Bureau as his second wife. In this way, the two of them separated. She followed her husband from the north to Shanghai in the south. She gave birth to this child less than a year after marrying him, and now it has been more than ten years!</p>
<p>As for him? Due to the enemy’s invasion, his hometown became a battlefield. Of course, they were unwilling to sit idly and wait for death, so they united with some comrades to resist the enemy, fighting the enemy for two whole years, hoping that the people inside the pass would rise up and help them and support them. But after enduring the immense difficulties until this year, they finally had no choice but to come south with a dozen or so comrades. Although he had studied, it was so difficult to find a job! They had no choice but to work as salesmen for a “Jixing Chemical Industrial Society.”</p>
<p>From superficial acquaintances to deep understanding, everything became clear!</p>
<p>At this moment, she discovered that his once-lovely eyes, more forked black hair and a red mark on his forehead. Although the red mark on his forehead was still as red as ever, his hair had turned much whiter! A large scar added to the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>At this moment, her husband—the wealthy gentleman—suddenly appeared at the door. The husband saw her hugging a salesman who looked like a beggar in a very intimate way and immediately scolded her for being vulgar, chasing him—the traveling merchant—out. As she was about to leave, she finally couldn’t help but shout, “Second Brother! I’ll go with you! I’ve already sold myself to him—Constable Chang—for ten years. Are you telling me to sell myself to him for the rest of my life? Are you telling me to be humiliated by him again? Now, now is the time for the one who has been sold to redeem herself! It’s time for the one who has been abused and deceived to break free from his chains!” The traveling merchant immediately said, “That’s right! Miss Run, we have already seen our future clearly. Those comrades in the ice and snow of the Northeast are waiting for us!” After they finished speaking, they held hands and rushed out into the wilderness of swirling snowflakes!</p>
<p>Although the wealthy gentleman forcibly grabbed the child, the child forcefully shook off his father's hand and followed after them, shouting tragically, "Mom! Mr. Feng! Wait, take me with you, take me to the Northeast. Others have forgotten the Northeast, but I haven't forgotten the Northeast! Take me!"</p>

<p>Opening “Romance of the West Chamber, Huiming Delivering the Letter”</p>
<p>Peonies bloom, the garden is beautiful. How can disaster be brought for no reason? They happened to encounter the violent bandit Sun Feihu. Layers upon layers of densely arranged spears and swords. They say, they want to seize Cui as the lady of the stronghold. The underlings surround, shouting loudly. The monks are all frightened. They, the mistress and two maids, cry bitterly. The old lady is helpless and has no good plan. She says, alas, my daughter is suffering a calamity. From both corridors, the monks shout out. They want to express their grief with tears like the tide. They say, whether monks or laymen can repel the bandits. I am willing to betroth my daughter. Zhang Junrui laughs from the west chamber. He says that I, this student, am friends with General White Horse. If someone can deliver the letter. Why worry that he will not be able to flee like a rat. The lady listens. Her heart is filled with joy. The gentleman's strength is higher than the heavens. She immediately ordered Huiming to send the letter. Breaking through the encirclement with courage. Go to Puguan to recruit troops and horses. He must be killed, not a single piece of armor will remain, and his soul will be shattered. The bandits all flee in the wind.</p>

<p>Film News</p>
<h3>Recent News from Tianyi</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>The copyright of Zhang Henshui's famous novel "Taiping Flower" has been acquired by Tianyi.</p>
<p>"Welcoming Spring Song" is a script that has been approved by Tianyi. Whether it will be filmed after "Flowers and Grasses" remains to be determined by the Tianyi authorities.</p>
<p>The "Waltz Song" sung by singer Zhang Shiyin in "Flowers and Grasses" is the "Merry Widow" sung by Jeanette MacDonald.</p>
<p>All the interior scenes of "Flowers and Grasses" have been filmed. There is still one exterior scene left, which should be completed within the next few days.</p>
<p>Gao Lihen is working on the editing of "Flowers and Grasses" every day.</p>
<p>Zhang Wen wrote a large article in the newspaper, stating her attitude towards acting. (Confucius said: "State" well! Good! Good!)</p>
<p>Leng Bo took leave to go to Beijing to participate in the China Dance and Drama Association's performance of "Resurrection."</p>
<h3>"The Stray Lamb" Chen Juanjuan</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Mu Golong</p>
<h3>Little Liu Zi and the Corpse</h3>
<p>"The Stray Lamb" is being filmed at the outdoor shooting location.</p>
<p>In front of a dilapidated tile house that has already collapsed, a beggar who died of hunger and cold is covered under a straw mat.</p>
<p>A group of stray lambs, because they stole bread from disaster relief, were driven over by the police like livestock. Little Sanzi (Ge Zuo Zhi) pulled Cui Er (Chen Juan Juan) and ran towards the construction site. Little Liu Zi (Wang Ziqing) was forced to hide under the straw mat covering the corpse.</p>
<p>He didn't know that there was a dead person covered under the straw mat. When he discovered that he was lying side by side with the corpse, he was completely terrified.</p>
<p>The police arrived at this place, and Little Liu Zi was finally arrested.</p>
<p>Such a scene of comedy is indeed tinged with a strong sense of bitterness.</p>
<h3>Silver Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Xia Peizhen is now guest-starring in a modern drama at Tianyun Building. Recalling the era of "Burning Red Lotus Temple," there are really thousands of words that one does not know how to say.</p>
<p>Diantong expanded excessively and closed down. "Certain people" said triumphantly, "From the cruel reflection of history, it can be seen that the companies and producers currently being 'praised' most enthusiastically by film critics all have the possibility of being eliminated."</p>
<p>The film critics deserve to die, and this is exactly why. However, did Diantong really die from being "praised" (let's just say it was "praise") by film critics?</p>
<p>Diantong's closure can be said to be completely due to the excessive overhead costs. Looking at the slow output of various companies now, it is really disheartening.</p>
<p>If there are more film companies closing down in the future, then according to "certain people," the blame will definitely be on the film critics again, either being "praised to death" or "criticized to collapse." Do you think there is a more fair saying than this besides this?</p>
<p>Northwest Film Company followed Diantong and closed down. I wonder if it was also praised or criticized to death by film critics?</p>
<p>"Competing for Beauty" is scheduled for a test screening at Jincheng on the 16th.</p>
