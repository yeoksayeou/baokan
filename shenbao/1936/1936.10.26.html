<h3 id="c39">工部局的緊縮政策 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>上海公共租界工部局。因受界內商業衰落的影響。在財政上發生了很大的困難。據今年上半年的報告。該局本年度的負債總額。恐將超過一百萬元。下年度的預算。如果再不設法補救。就要短少三百五十萬元光景。該局為平衡收支起見。有過增加捐率從百分之十四到百分十六的擬議。因遭市民的反對。沒有實現。最近便决定採取緊縮政策了。這在原則上本是市民所可贊同的。然而到今為止。工部民表示的緊縮方針。實在還不能使我們滿意。第一。該局單就中下級公務人員的待遇條例。作了相當的修改。例如月薪二三十元的探員。本來每月可領車費十二元。現在這項車費取消了。他們的生活上不能不受到重大的打擊。可是每月支領鉅薪且有房租教育費等津貼的高級洋員的待遇。還不見有多大的更改。且據日前西報所載。某洋員在工部局服務不過八年半。這次解職以後。除續領一年半的薪俸之外。還可領取終身養老金每年八百鎊。這種對於退職人員的鉅額的支出。雖說是由於合同關係。然而在目前的緊縮聲浪之下。終究是不合理的。第二。該局决定在本年底裁撤情報處和人力車務委員會這兩個機關。人力車務委員會本是臨時性質的機關。裁撤以後。將工作移歸敬務處辦理。是不成問題的。至於情報處的裁撤實在很有考量的餘地。該處雖然不過成立了五年有餘。郤是工部局最有意義的附屬機關之一。工部局設立該處的動機。是在該局　道受了五卅事件的刺戟。覺得市政當局與市民之間有溝通意見的常設機關。以求消弭雙方情感的隔閡。該處成立以後。因任用得人。的確很能盡這樣的使命這幾年來。不但在報紙上增添了公共租界市政方面不少的資料。而且工部局的行政方針。也因該處勤於　　市民輿論的緣故。受到不少有利的影響。無論如何。就行政效率來說。情報處的存在是必要的。現在工部局决定裁撤該處。所可節省的開支。就照該局所公布。也不過每年四萬六千元。如果其中再除去了接替該處一部分職務的情報帮辦的薪俸。那么。每年所可節省的就决不會到四萬元。在下年度瞀的差數中間。不過能够彌補百分之一左右的數額罷了。情報處的裁撤在工部局財政上的意義旣然如此有限。我們希望在該處還未撤銷以前。工部局董事會對於這個問題。再加以適當的考慮。</p>
<p>總之。工部局如果實行緊縮。應當着眼於太過　　的非必要的地方。與其削减低級公務員的生活費。不如削减高級公務員的優厚的額外津貼。與其裁撤關係着多數市民的機關。不如裁撤關係着少數市民的機關。公共租界的市民中間。中國人的人數在一百十二萬以上。外國人的人數則不到四萬。而工部局所舉辦的事業。郤有若干部門都偏重於少數外國人的福利。我們主張工部局的緊縮應該從那些部門入手。</p>

<p>大通社云、長江自水量暴落以來、中游自漢口至長沙段航輪、已難行駛、輪船公司、已提前加收淺水費、至下游上海至漢口間、因江水仍逐有减縮、故航行亦將漸瀕艱困、此誠極足注意之事、茲探錄各情如次、</p>
<p>去年同時　水位懸殊</p>
<p>記者特趨訪寗紹商輪公司總務主任陳仁徵氏、叩以當茲江水日落、下游滬漢錢航行、將否發生困難、據陳氏談、最近長江水位陡落至十餘英尺、實近數十年來少見之事、卽去年此時、水位尙在三十六七英尺之間、與今年比較、陡落二十英尺、堪稱異狀、</p>
<p>繼落不已　减輕吃水</p>
<p>陳氏繼謂、該公司之寗靖輪、最近自漢口來滬、當經過江水最淺之太子磯時、曾親加測量、水位已祗十七英尺、惟滬漢航輪、裝儎客貨、最重吃水約十二三英尺、故現在尙無影響、萬一江水仍退落不已、降至十英尺左右、則尙可少儎客貨、使船身吃水减輕、使與水位相適、</p>
<p>暴縮原因　雨量稀少</p>
<p>陳氏續謂、現在最低水位、旣尙有十六七英尺、故下游行船、一時尙無若何困難、第應特別審愼而已、蓋設或一船擱淺、且足窒碍其他輸隻之航行、故引港當茲淺水時期、駕御尤不可不把細云、至今年長江淺水時間提早、據陳氏謂、由於揚子江流域近來雨量稀少、以致江水乾涸、故深望卽獲沛然降雨、則不僅長江行船獲益、而田疇亦慶霑足云、</p>
<p>海關設吃　水限制牌</p>
<p>江海關巡江事務處、爲指示淺水時期之上行航輪起見、已在蕪湖設置吃水限制牌、懸示蕪湖以上沿途水位尺數、使自滬赴漢各江輸、有所遵循、該項吃水牌上、並裝有燈光、故雖在深夜、亦瞭然可見、又悉各江輪之吃水量、須低於水位六英寸、藉策安全云、</p>

<p>本市社會局主辦之第四屆全市運動會、經二日半競爭、已於昨日上午圓滿結束、大專組男錦標歸大夏、體專體師組男錦標均屬東亞、大會給獎典禮、將另行擇期舉行、綜觀本屆全市運動會雖因分組過多、事務紛繁、到會塲情形於第一日稍形凌亂、然第二日以後卽已整飭、大會職員及運動員精神俱佳、成績雖未能滿意、但會中尙少無謂之糾紛、</p>
<p>本屆全市運動會因辦法變更、不依舊規舉行、故紀錄上實無法與歷屆比較、茲姑將此次各組成績比較最優者、列成一表、與市運會最高記錄比較、則知女子田徑除五十公尺及跳遠二項外、共餘破紀錄者達七項、平等紀錄一項、男子田徑僅鐵餅一項破紀錄、餘均相差甚遠、於此可得二點感想、（一）本屆女子成績較男子爲優、而女體師成績更優、男子跳高大專體校均不及高中、此亦異數、（二）此全市最高紀錄尙係三年前的、因市敎局第三屆市運會於民國二十二年舉行也、所以三年來本市男子運動成績未有進步、負責體育者應予以深切之注意、</p>

<h3 id="c156">日本蠶絲業發展之過程 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧葆光</p>
<p>（一）蠶絲業在日本經濟上之價值</p>
<p>養蠶業，是日本僅次於米的第二大農產物製絲工業，是日本最古而且是近代的基本工業；絲織物是日本國際貿多上，一筆最大的輸出品。故蠶絲業，在日本農村經濟上，資本主義經濟機構上，以及國際貿易收支上，都佔着最重要的地位。</p>
<p>日本的蠶絲業，不僅在日本佔着重要地盤，就是在世界上，也把握着第一王位。日本是世界上最大的生絲生產國，同時是最大的絲織物輸出國。</p>
<p>（一）農家經濟上之價值</p>
<p>養蠶業在日本農業經濟上所佔的重要地位，在養蠶戶數比率及生產價格比率上，很明白表現出來。</p>
<p>日本的農家戶數，大正元年爲五·四三八千戶，養蠶戶數爲一·五〇〇千戶，約佔總額二七·六％。自後步步增加，至昭和四年，農家總戶五·五七六千戶中，養蠶戶數，達二·二一七千戶，佔總額三九·八％。後因世界經濟恐慌襲來，絲價暴落，日本農村，首先受到莫大的打擊，自後，養蠶業者漸减，至昭和九年，在五·六，一七千戶中，養蠶者佔一·九九五千戶的佔總額三五·五％。</p>
<p>米是日本最大的農產物，繭是日本第二大農產物。據昭和三年農林省統計，農產物生產總値三十八億餘萬元，米佔十八億餘萬元，繭價佔六億六千餘萬元，約當總額一·七％。昭和四年，農產物總數爲三十四億八千萬元，繭價五億五千餘萬元，約佔一六％弱。昭和七年，爲日本農村最不景氣之年，農產物總値减至二十億，約餘萬元，繭價减至二億九千七百萬元佔一二％。</p>
<p>繭雖然是日本農產物中次於米的生產品，然而在日本農家收入上看來，佔着米以上的地位。因日本農業，仍然是小農階級佔最大多數，小農階級所生產的米，大多數只能够自己的消費，故從事於販賣者，幾乎沒有，但一般農戶所生產的繭，全是販賣商品，故繭爲養蠶家最大的一筆現金收人。因此養蠶業日本農業在經濟上之價値，更形重要矣。</p>
<p>（二）工業經濟上之價値</p>
<p>昭和七年，日本工業生產總額，五十九億八千餘萬元，生絲及絲織物生額達五億九千萬元，佔總額九·七％。昭和九年，因軍需工業及輸出工業之景氣，工業生產額增至九十三億九千萬元，但生絲及絲織物，因世界經濟恐慌之侵襲减至五億六千餘萬元，對總生產額的比率，相對的减至五·九％。但在日本工業經濟上，依然不失爲重要部門。</p>
<p>又據昭和九年度上工塲統計，使用職工五人以上者，全日本達八萬三百工塲，而製絲工塲佔五千百餘。職工數，在全日本二百十三萬人中，製絲業者達三十六萬餘人。這也充分的表示着相當重要的地位。</p>
<p>（三）國際貿易上之價値</p>
<p>絲織物在日本國際貿易上，是一筆最大的出超貨物，在國際收支上，更佔特殊地位，這在貧乏的日本經濟機構中，由原料製造，以至於輸出，的是稀有的現象</p>
<p>昭和三年，日本國際貿易輸出總額十九億七千二百萬元，絲織物佔八憶七千八日萬元，佔輸出總額四四％。昭和六年，日本輸出貿易降至十四億一千萬元，絲織物輸出亦以世界之不景氣而减至四億元，對輸出總額减至二八％。昭和十年，日本輸出貿易激增至二十四億八千萬元，絲織物爲四億七千九百萬元，對輸出總額相對的减至一五％。絲織物輸出額，因世界經濟的不景氣，一般的購買力底下，同時在日本軍需工業膨脹及一部分輸出工業活躍的空氣中，雖然相對的步步低落，但在日本國際收支上，依然是一筆最大的財源。</p>
<p>（二）日本蠶絲業之現狀</p>
<p>日本的蠶絲業，也是跟着日本資主義經濟發展的路綫，而步步向上發展着。在明治初年，日本經濟建設的過程中，對蠶絲生產上的增產；技術上的改善；國際貿易上的擴張，努力進行，不遺餘力，在明治二十二—二十六年時代，蠶絲生產額不過一百十萬貫，（註一）當時之輸出貿易額，僅千九百萬元，至明治四十四年時代，生產額增至三百四十餘萬貫，輸出額增至一億二千九百餘萬元，二十年中，其發展的程度達三倍，輸出達七倍。嗣後歐戰勃發，日本的蠶絲業，又跟着向上發展，在大戰前大正三年，生產額爲三百七十五萬貫，輸出額一億六千萬元，歐戰結東後，大正八年，生產額達六百三十六萬貫，輸出額，達六億二千三百餘萬一元。</p>
<p>日本蠶絲業若是的向上飛躍，考其發展的原因有二：（一）政府的獎勵與提倡，（二）日本一般經濟向上發展及國際市塲擴大的刺激。關於前者，政府勸誘農民養蠶，鼓勵輸出，明治二十一年四月一日頒布輸出獎勵法。三十三年，廢除每百二十三元六十一錢的輸出稅，並貸放資金，購買新式機械，以圖技術上之改善。在明治二十二—二十六年時代，使用機械者，佔四一％，用舊式生產方法者，佔五九％，至明治四四年，使用機械者，佔七〇％，用舊式方法者僅三〇％。在養蠶業方面，生產方法，也跟着進步，就是質的方面，亦顯著的向上，在明治初年，桑園一町步（註二）的收繭，量不過七貫，明治四十年時，大體增收達九貫，最多者達十一貫，至昭和八年，更增至十五貫餘。因為生產技術的進步，故桑圜所佔耕地的比率及養蠶農戶的比率。自明治初年至現在，僅僅增加二五％，然而生產額却增加六倍，輸出額增加六百倍。關於後者，在日本當時各種經濟向上發展之際，如紡織工業，交通事業，各種基本工業，以及國民的文化程度等，向上發展的刺激，再加中日·日俄·歐戰幾次戰後所奪取的市塲及殖民地等刺激，故一躍而襲世界蠶絲王位。</p>
<p>自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌襲來，與日本蠶絲業以極大的打擊。原來日本的養蠶業，因爲日本沒有棉花的緣故，早經是他有史以來唯一的衣服原料，故在明治以前幕府時代，曾幾度嚴禁蠶絲輸出，至明治維新時，新興的紡織工業漸漸抬頭，英國每年輸入日本的大宗棉紗，以及自國所生產的棉紗及棉織物，漸漸代替了絲織物的地位，故現在的日本，已經是由絲織物本位國變爲棉織物本位國；而絲織物反成一種輸出的商品了。因是，日本絲織物輸出額已如前述的年年遞增。與國際經濟之關聯及國際貿易之依存性，亦漸漸擴大，由是而世界經濟的變化，在日本蠶絲業上，也充分的反映出來。故常世界經濟恐慌襲來之秋，日本的蠶絲業首先受到打擊。</p>
<p>日本生絲及絲織物輸出額，因歐戰後景氣的結果，昭和三年，輸出總額達八億七千八百萬元，昭和四年，九億四千三百萬元，至昭和五年受世界經濟恐慌的影饗，輸出額激减至四億八千八百萬元，內中生絲佔四億一千九百萬元，絲織物佔六千八百萬元。絲織物輸出地，以印度，澳洲為最，英國及滿洲次之，因日本輸出的絲織物是高級品，買購者，大多為資產隆級，故雖在世界經濟恐慌之秋，絲織物依然能保持原有的地位，唯生絲則與此不同。日本蠶絲品中輸出最多者爲生絲，生絲輸出地中，最要者爲美國，大正十四年，日本生絲輸出額八億七千七百萬元，輸入美國者達八億四千四百萬元，佔總額九六·四％，昭和五年，因世界一般的不景氣，日本生絲輸出額激减至四億一千九百萬元，輸出美國的比率减至九五％，昭和九年，因世界不景氣的深刻以及各國對於日本商品的防止策，故日本生絲輸出額，减至二億八千七百萬元，造成十餘年來的最低紀錄，昭和十年，雖回復到三億八千七百萬元，但在跛行景氣的日本經濟過程中，依然是很大的威脅。且在輸出萎縮的過程上，有二點値得人注意的現象（一）輸出的價値减退五一％，輸出量僅减五％，這所表現的事實，就是絲價暴落，絲價暴落，在日本工業經濟上，雖然是一大威脅，但在日本農村經濟上，確是致命的打擊，此點，近年日本農村經濟之破產，就是明證。（二）輸入美國者，在昭和四年時佔總額九六·五％，去年度漸漸至八四·一％，此後仍有减退之趨向，反之輸出於歐洲方面者，却由二·三％，减加至十一·八％·這證明日本蠶絲業，對美國之依存性漸簿，對歐洲各國之依存性漸深。今將近年日本生絲輸出額及地域關係比率製表於後，</p>
<p>日本生絲輸出狀況表</p>
<p>（備考）輸出額單位百萬斤，輸出價値單位百萬元，比率以昭和四年爲一〇〇，輸出地，　額爲一〇〇。</p>
<p>（一）恐慌過程中之日本蠶絲生產狀况日本蠶絲業與國際貿易之依存性旣如前說的深刻，故國際經濟盛衰之轉變亦與此依存性成正比例的支配着日本，全部的蠶絲業，世界經濟恐慌的高潮，已於一九二九年侵襲了各部門，而直接支配着的日本蠶絲業，也跟着起了莫大的變化。</p>
<p>日本蠶繭的生產額，大正十四年時八千四百八十萬貫，總値八億一千四百餘萬元。昭和四年生產總額减至一萬〇二百萬貫，總價値却减至六億五千五百萬元。昭和五年，世界經濟恐慌襲來，生產額雖繼續增至一萬〇六百萬貫，但總價値知激减至三億四百萬元。以後，年年遞减，昭和八年曾一度回復到五億元，但昭和九年大風水災，冷災，旱災，交相襲擊生產額减至八千七百萬貫，而總價値却跌至二億二百八十萬元。比之最高紀錄的大正十四年，减退七五％，這在日本農村經濟上，實在是自明治維新以來，一個最大的打擊。故　晤和四年以來，養蠶戶數，由二百三十萬戶减至百九十九萬戶，桑園佔地，由七十一萬四千町，减至六十二萬三千町，此後猶有减退之傾　。</p>
<p>生絲生產狀况，也是跟着世界經濟盛衰之皆段而轉變，大正十四年，生絲生產總額八百二十八萬貫，總價値達九億五千六百萬元。昭和三年，生產額增至一千五十八萬貫，總値降至八億三千五百萬元。昭和五年，生產額增至一千一百三十六萬貫，價値降至五億三千六百萬元。至昭和九年，生產額再度增至一千二百萬貫，爲日本生產的最高紀錄，但價値降至三億九千八百萬元，爲近二十年來之最低紀錄。昭和十年價値增至四億八千八百萬元，故昨今年的情形，比昭和九年度，有若干回復之望。</p>
<p>繭價，生絲價，雖然大跌特跌，生產總値跌落二五％二九％，而絲織物生產價値，依然保持原狀，這就是說，絲織物是特殊階級的消耗品，雖然世界若是之不景氣，而特殊階級的消耗品，猶能保持原狀，就此可以證明恐慌之階級性。日本絲織物生產價格，昭和五年，三億二千七百萬元，昭和九年，日本蠶絲業最不景氣之年，但絲織物生產總値，即增至三億四千一百萬元，昭和十年繼續增至三億四千九百萬元，此後，猶　增加之希望。</p>
<p>日本繭·生絲·絲織物生產狀况</p>
<p>（備考）產額單位千貫，價額單位千元。</p>
<p>（二）恐慌過程中蠶絲業與日本經濟之影響</p>
<p>前面說過了，世界經濟恐慌，影響到日本生絲輸出不振，輸出不振，影響到絲價暴落，絲價暴落，直接影響到繭價暴落，更影響到製絲業者之利益，及農家經濟之收支，以及製絲業，農家經濟等關係之一環，在此影傳播過程中，所波及之範圍，亦愈演愈大，故日本近年之經濟恐慌，若謂蠶絲業爲恐慌之最初發動力，亦不爲過言。</p>
<p>繭是日本農村的第二大農產物，而且是農產物中之唯一商品和唯一收支，故繭價之漲跌，就是農村經濟景氣與恐慌的指針。日本每年春繭與秋繭平均一貫的價格，在明治時代，長久的保持着四元至五元的水平價格，自歐戰暴發後，漸漸抬頭，大正八年漲至十一元五十七錢，爲日本近世史中之最高紀錄，大正十四年十元五十八錢，是後步步低落，昭和四年降至七元六錢，五年世界大恐慌襲來，激降至三元十錢，九年更降至二元四十五錢之最低價格。</p>
<p>繭價暴落，農家唯一的經濟來源斷絕，農村經濟遂不得不陷於破產之一途。日本農村破產的典型證明，如日本農村負債總額，在大正十四年時代，不過十三億元。但據最近的調査估計，將達六十億元，故現在日本農村中，銀行地主勃興，一般貧農在靑黃不接時，出賣靑田寒蠶（註三）者愈多，農村的饑餓子弟，更批的集中都市，影饗到都市中一般勞働階級生活狀况，因是而勞働工資低落，勞働時間延長，以造成近年以來整個日本勞働階級生活之破產。</p>
<p>在農村方面演出這種破產的現象，在製絲工業方面，幾有同像傾向。日本使用機械製絲的工塲，在大正十四年時，凡三千六百四十三工塲，二十七萬六千釜數减至二十三萬五十三萬二千六百餘工塲，昭和十年减至三萬八千四百工塲，釜數亦自十六萬二千减至四萬八千。這種步步衰落的傾向，當然是恐慌過程中淘汰的結果。</p>
<p>（三）製絲規模及諸設備</p>
<p>在現世紀上，日本雖然是絲業王國，然而她的企業形態，依然保持着手工業乃至家庭工業等經營的方式，因此中小工塲佔百分之九十以上的絕對多數，在日本蠶業中，把握着支配的地位。</p>
<p>據商工省統計，織機工塲數，在大正十四年，十一萬工塲中，五台不滿者，十萬四千八百餘工塲，佔全體百分之九四％五台至十台者二千九百餘工塲，十台至五十台者二千四百餘，五十台以上者僅二百十八工塲而已。至昭和九年，五台未滿者减至六萬一千八百工塲，五台至十台者增至四千六百餘工塲，十台至五十台者增至五千七百工塲，五十台以上者增至六百九十一工塲，總工塲數减至七萬二千九百餘</p>
<p>日本機業工塲數</p>
<p>上表充分證明日本的製絲工業，依然是小規模的家庭工業，現在在恐慌的淘汰下，已經轉入新的傾向了，小工塲漸漸减少，大工塲漸漸增加，然而時代的轉變，要走入紡織工業那樣健全的途徑，　猶須　日了。</p>
<p>在目前比較健全的企業形態，約而言之有四。</p>
<p>（A）片倉製絲　大正九年三月創立，額定資本五千三百五十五萬元，實收資本二千六百七十七萬五千元，在各產蠶要區建設四十五工塲，設備能力，凡一萬四千九百五十釜，生產能力，昭和九年度達九十五萬二千百十一貫，為日本第大製絲工塲。</p>
<p>（B）郡是製絲　明治二十九年創立，額定資本，二千〇六十六萬六千元，實收資本　千五百二十九萬七千元，在全國各要區設立工塲二十三所，設備能力達一萬一千〇四十八釜，昭和九年生產額達九十一萬六千餘貫，是日本最有歷史的製絲王國。</p>
<p>（C）日本絲織　大正七年六月創立，額定資本四十五萬元，實收三十五萬元，在各要區設立六工塲，設織絲機三萬四千餘錠，織機一千三百四十三台，昭和九年上期生產額萬一千疋。</p>
<p>（C）日本紡絲　大正七年八月創立，額定資本百萬元，實收九十一萬三千元，在桐生市設立新式工塲，紡絲錠五萬三千枚，生產額三萬二千五百貫。</p>
<p>（四）日本蠶絲業之前途及統制之現狀</p>
<p>日本蠶絲業，在世界經濟盛衰及國際關係轉變約支配下，在現階段上，再要恢復到大正十四年那樣的繁榮，殊爲不可能。</p>
<p>目前整個的國際關係，在各個帝國主義經濟角逐的漩渦內旋轉着，整個的通商政策，完全被支配於自給自足的意識下在自己的勢力範圍，結成經濟布洛克，故自渥太華協定結成大英布洛克以來，日本輸出英領各屬地的棉布，大受打擊，自美國布洛克實現以來，日本輸出美國的貨物，大受影響，如一九二九年以前，日本輸出美國的生絲佔總額九六％，近年因其國內經濟之不景氣，國民購買力薄弱，以至於提高關稅，防止日貨輸入，故連年日本輸出美國的生絲額，已由五千四百萬斤，减至四千二百萬斤，比率已由九六·五％降至八四·一％。照目前美國通商政策所支配的日本生絲，很難恢復原狀。此外，在歐洲各國，近年雖有增加之傾向，但在目前國際關係轉變中，及通商政策壓迫下，亦無發展之餘地。此外可抱樂觀者，只滿洲而已，但以氣候的關係，及農村經濟破產，故在目前亦無發展之可能。至於日本國內的消費問題，在此農村經濟被產，中小商工業不景氣，勞働階級生活低下的今日，若希望其對絲織品的購買增加，那更是不可能的事實。</p>
<p>日本的蠶絲業，在國際市塲上，若是的不能抱樂觀，在內部市塲上，若是之不能有期待，在此進退維谷的恐慌過程中，強有力的統制機關出現。　　統制機關，也是經濟恐慌過程中，通商政策的一種手段，突破現狀的一種方法，對內　統制生產，獎勵生活技術進步，對外則發展市塲。</p>
<p>本來日本蠶絲業的統制設施，在明治四十四年，就有蠶絲業合作社之設立，大正十五年，改為蠶絲業同类合作中央會。全盤的指導統制蠶絲業事宜，至昭和六年第五十九議會，公布蠶絲業合作法，根據此法創立日本中央蠶絲會，昭和七年三月，解散蠶絲業合作中央會，遂成現在日本最高的蠶絲業統制機關。</p>
<p>日本中央蠶絲會，在政府通商政策指導之下，統制日本蠶絲事宜，其組織綱領，大槪如下圖：</p>

<p>（三），日本蠶絲業之發展與中國蠶絲業</p>
<p>蠶絲在中國有較日本最久的歷史，數千年來，作爲唯一的衣服原料。至元朝時棉花自印度傳入，漸漸奪取固有的蠶絲地位，而蠶絲品反成爲奢侈器。自淸末以來，機械工業勃興，國際通商關係，日益密切，由是而蠶絲業，一時成了中國唯一輸出品，不唯在中國對外貿易上佔着特殊地位，就是在中國農村經濟上，以至工業經濟上，都把握最重要的地位。自日本蠶絲發展以來，因政府獎勵輸出政策，生產技術之進步，中國在歐美各國，固有之蠶絲市塲，漸漸被其侵奪殆盡，因是而中國蠶絲業步步陷於深淵。中國生絲輸出貿易，民國十一年，達一億四千八百餘萬元，佔貿易輸出總額二二％，民國十八年，輸出額達一憶六千五百萬元，至民國二十年降至九千五百萬元，二十一年再降至三千六百萬元，達空前的低紀錄。這在中國農村經濟上，尤其是江蘇浙江的農村，瀕於破產，在中國工業經濟上，上海無錫一百〇七家製絲工塲，停工者達九十餘家，在中國國際貿易上失去一筆最大的抵償金額，其影響所及，將不只蠶絲業一部之破產而已。</p>
<p>總之，中國蠶絲業之沒落，與日本蠶絲業之勃興，尤其是日本所施行的保護通商政策皆有密切關係，然而日本蠶絲業，生產技術之進步，經營方法之加善，統制步伐之齊整，這也是被驅逐的人們，應該深思長省的。</p>

<p>— 錢天達</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>華絲因受世界經濟恐慌之侵襲，日絲之排擠，人造絲之傾軋，近年來對外貿易，一落千丈，幾步華茶後塵，有日暮途窮之概。</p>
<p>民國二十三年（一九三四年）全國出口數量，僅三萬二千九百七十七公擔，（約合五萬二千七百七十三擔），價値二千三百五十一萬九千一百五十元，（約合一千六百八十三萬三千七百八十八兩）爲民國以來輸出最少之年，亦爲極度衰落之年。較之輸出最多年（一九二九年）之十八萬九千九百八十包，價格一萬四千七百六十八萬一千三百八十八兩，數量不及三分之一，價格不及八分之一，誠可謂極度衰落矣。</p>
<p>「否極泰來　，極度衰落之後，必有復行繁榮之日，此經濟循環（Economic　Circle）原理也。去年（一九三五）世界經濟，經長期枯萎之後，漸形回蘇，華絲銷路，稍有轉機，又以國府實行新貨幣政策關係，對外貿易驟轉活躍。計去年上海一埠渾出生絲五萬五千零零七包，廣東運出四萬二千二百三十一包，總計爲九萬七千二百三十八包，滬錫各地製絲廠，又紛紛開工，以爲黃金時代，又來臨矣。</p>
<p>今年因天時關係，繭身欠佳，繅折頗大，故絲市雖常在六七百元，絲廠亦僅敷成本，無利可佔，秋繭又吿歉收，（江浙兩省今年秋繭五成），原料不足，繭價高漲，成本加昂，若絲價不漲，銷路有障碍時，絲廠必又感周轉之困難，前年窘狀，不難復見於今日。</p>
<p>最近法政府放棄金本位，將法郞貶値，中法匯率，驟由國幣一百元合四百六十四法郞（九月二十五日），跌至六百三十法郞（現中央銀行掛牌），華絲交易驟吿停頓，影響於吾國生絲之外銷者，異常重大。或以爲吾國對法輸出並非重要，法國用絲數量稀少，不若美國之巨，無足顧慮，其實華絲銷法，自有其特殊之地位，請申述之。</p>
<p>（二）華絲法銷之重要</p>
<p>法國向爲用絲巨量之國，華絲銷法，且具悠久之歷史，細條紋九至十一，及十三十五，向爲吾國特產，遠非日絲所可比擬。自歐戰發生而後，世界經濟大勢改變，金融重心，移轉紐約，美國因土地廣大，工商發達，人民富庶消費提高之故，用絲數量激增，遂一躍而爲世界消費生絲最多之國，日絲以注重美銷之故，遂亦高居生絲輸出國之首位。至吾國絲銷則向以法國爲大宗，在法國市塲之上，日絲非我之敵，在美國市塲之上，則華絲不足輕量也。茲將近十年法國生絲進口國別表列下：</p>
<p>法國生絲累年輸入國別表（單位百包）</p>
<p>由上表華絲在法之地位，實非任何國所可比擬，日本卽進步如何之快，尙不能與我相競，但美國市塲日絲之猛晉情形，則更爲吾人望塵莫及矣。</p>
<p>近十年美國生絲消費國別表（單位包）</p>
<p>最近十年美國生絲消費百分比較表</p>
<p>（註）上表年月係每年七月起至六月底為一年度、</p>
<p>由上表日本生絲在美市塲勢力之擴張，幾使華絲無絲毫存在之餘地，在此美國市塲日漸被排斥之條件下，其地市塲之亟應保持，自爲一定不易之理。（未完）</p>

<p>現在，正是稻熟蟹肥的時候，所以大批大批的橫行將軍，從別處送到上海來，陳列街頭，供人展覽，因此我們走在路上，觸目盡是這班耀武揚威的橫行將軍，。然而你儘橫行吧，不久將供人下酒了，看你橫行有多少時候！</p>
<p>蟹又呌「無腸公子」，是的，它一直橫行不法，得隴望蜀，真是毫無肝腸的東西！這樣的毫無肝腸，怪不得人人欲食其肉了。</p>
<p>「蝦兵蟹將」，蟹是水中的武士、然而它遍要上陸來耀武揚威，我所以送給一個大號呌做「海軍陸戰隊」。</p>
<p>蟹是住在水中的，它遍要不安本分，上陸來侵略，那裏知道它竟做了人們的美味而自送生命。蟹，我勸你嘅安分守己，還是在水中過你的生活吧！</p>
<p>「橫行」和「霸道」是連帶的，蟹是橫行將軍，從水中橫行上陸地。如果它說這種橫行是「王道」，那真是不要面孔的話了。幸虧蟹是不會說話的，然而會說話者，其將連蟹都不如吧？</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>穿著夾袍孖，身上還缺乏着充分的暖意，這時節，上海各街上熟酒店門口的鐵絲籠裏，又開始幽囚起所謂「陽澄河大閘蟹」來了。在這吃蟹季節中，老饕家持熬酌酒，笑口常開。販賣者，用廿兩頭稱，論擔的買進，十三兩四錢的稱，論斤的賣出，一轉手間，只須貼上幾根稻柴繩，便囊業如蟹兜兒一樣的充盈，也自然不由的顏開笑逐。而捕蟹者呢，雖然在月黑天高之夜，摸索河濱，十分辛苦，然而費些兒舉手之勞，便不難捕得盈筐累簏，向市間換得青蚨，以維生活。所以捕蟹者，雖然辛苦，可是當這吃蟹季節中，也常是滿臉兒堆下笑來的。——笑，笑，笑，在這吃蟹季節中，任誰都是挺開心的。例外的該淌淚的，我想，該昌好好地在水中生活着，而無辜被捕，被賣，而終於被吃的蟹吧？</p>
<p>人，終究是比蟹聰明，人，是懂得蟹有慕火性的，所以在捕蟹用的蟹籪上，常縣着一個風燈兒，誘引着蟹兒，爬上水面，而待捕。卽被捕後，復被幽囚在黑暗的所在，以防蟹見着光亮，而行動。因為蟹離水之後，行動得愈勤，便瘠瘦得愈甚。而在下鍋蒸煮時，更須將其二螯八足，結實地綁縛着，以防其在鍋底中，作最後之掙扎。據老饕家言，蟹一經在鍋底中掙扎，腿肉常是馳松着，有時，竟至空無所有，而大損風味，雖然人類對解所施的手段，是欺騙的，而且是殘忍的，但是誰教它們藏着一肚子的好東西，而引得老饕們，見之而為之食慾亢進呢？君子無罪，懷璧其罪。我於不幸這蟹，亦作如此觀。</p>
<p>「繩荒，蚊熟，蝦平，蟹亂，」這是蘇滬一帶農民們，預占天時人事的俗諺。在數年前，長江黃河，汜濫不已，已應了「蠅荒」之說。而今年繩少蚊多，果然秋穫豐登，顯著奇騐，在齊盧戰爭之前，蘇滬一帶，蟹多而賤，一元可購大蟹四斤，接着，戰事爆發了。一二八之前的秋間，蘇滬一帶的蟹産，也極豐，但不久，便又發生了變亂。雖然這是巧合，但「蟹亂」之說，可也不能不說是可以保留的。因此，我希望從今以後，蟹産日蹙，以免蟹亂，然而世之老饕，必有以我此言，為大殺風景，而日禱我言之幸而不中。</p>

<p>這幾天在蘇州的長街短巷裏面，常常可以聽到「澄蟹」的呌賣聲，玉質金膏，老饕　之，不免饞涎欲滴，食指思動，因憶已故樸學大師章太炎夫人湯國梨女士有句云：「不是洋澄湖蟹好，此生何必住蘇州。」可見洋澄湖裏的蟹，它的味兒，真夠動人啊！</p>
<p>蘇州咫尺之隔的唯亭，素以「魚米之鄉」著稱，且地濱澄湖，而澄湖尤以産蟹最擅勝名，故秋風一起，唯亭便成了蟹的集市，凡侵晟由市　交火車輪船之運輸，銷售京滬等地無日無之，惟在蘇州長街短巷裏面呌賣的，都係農民們捕獲後直接來自鄉間，故售介亦較低廉，因此到了深秋，凡作姑蘇游者，必購澄蟹而返，以快朵頤。</p>
<p>「稻熟蟹肥，」在這割稻時季，正是「澄蟹」入市之時，雖然「九雌十雄」，現在還才過中秋，但是今年不是閏月的緣故，早已到了黃花吐豔的季節，那末「九月團臍，」此其時矣，老饕們正可大動食指，籬畔持鏊了。</p>
<p>農民捕蟹之法，除掉張網植籪划船捕捉之外，最多在黃昏時候，植竿水淺之處，張以燈籠，逐水沉沒的無腸公子，見燈光郭索而來者，絡繹不絕，農民乃預鋪蓆於地，人臥蓆上，期待着蟹的橫行而臨，舉手捕之，無不得心應手，世之趨炎赴勢，輒投羅網者，其蟹之類乎！</p>
<p>食蟹之法各異予謂以　线縛蟹之八足兩鏊，置於蒸籠，隨蒸隨食，不令冷卻，厥味最為腴美，若和水而煎，未免失却真味，蟹性寒而並有腥味，食後蘇習，必進紅糖湯解之，再以菊葉或白酒洗手，以去腥味。</p>

<p>鮮蟹如欲藏養，可用　子一隻，內散放稻穀，上鋪蟹一層，再散放稻穀一層，逐層鋪滿，將　口密封，雖隔二三月，亦可不死，然一經透風，則完全失效，且二三月後蟹必較初入　時肥大，讀者不妨一試。</p>
<p>食蟹時除必佐以薑醋旨酒之外，食後亦須飲紅糖水一杯，最好中亦放一二薑片，乃不致受寒涼而腹痛。</p>
<p>蟹與柿不能同食，食則必多不救，腹絞痛而死，此外，花生亦不可同食。</p>
<p>煮蟹應用涼水，事前並須用細繩緊縛其螯足，不然，易脫落。最佳之食蟹法，不用水煮，將蟹縛後置於鍋中架上蒸之，則味較水煮尤人美可口，惟必須洗滌清潔。</p>

<p>一蟹不如一蟹。比喻人事每況愈下，宋陶穀因以譏吳越王錢俶者也。其詞若俚，其義頗長。按吳越自謬啟祚，外却黃巢，內誅董昌，管十四州，赫然英雄。元瓘嗣立，東敗於閩，已覺遜色。及佐與倧，賊臣強隣，交相侵迫，勢益阽危。至俶，且惟知傾其國力，以事貢獻矣。人才日下，何待穀言！雖然，人無有不願為英雄者，實至名歸，所尚業績。不目奮勵，遂貽鄰使面義，百代以後，猶不勝為忠懿惜也！俗又有以蟹方人之衡逆不可理喻者，曰：「看爾橫行到幾時」？此語亦足深長以思。帶甲模弋，踩躏江湖，受者莫敢膺懲，自為無敵於天下矣；不知秦人畏蟹，溺於少見，及其卽狎，但覺技止此耳：河伯雖耐，魚蝦已怒，寒　束縛，終難倖免秋高一背紅也。以物推人，借家喻邦，適可弗知足者，原屬一例。</p>

<p>……德國名醫曾解剖早衰死亡的遺屍五十六具盡得其秘　……古今最長壽的人為英為實氏活一百五十一歲又九月　……各國科學家的努力加餐人類未來的壽命有增長可能</p>
<p>人類的身體各部，均有巧妙的作用，如發動此作用的主要腺器生死腺萎頹，則最易罹病，衰老較早。德國著名生理學家盧斯白赫博士Rosenbach.M.D.曾將早衰死亡者的遺屍，收集五十六具，各加以精密的解剖，竟全無強壯的生殖腺，致命病菌易以侵入，遂致早衰。因此證明如能將生殖腺培養強壯，卽能使其人之精神充足，疾病不生，雖不能永久不死，至亦亦可享八十歲以上的高齡。</p>
<p>再，將古來非常長壽之人，可舉出許多實例，但其可確信者，為數不多，像英人寶瑪斯巴爾氏，可為確實之證據，此人在一六三五年死去，活了一百五十二年零九個月又七天，在此人之死後，卽由名醫哈佛埃氏，解剖其遺體，其內臟各器官非常健全，而尤以生殖腺為最，幾一無老衰的形跡，故彼死後數百年中，各國學者無不否認寶氏之所以生長，完全因生殖腺特別強壯之故。</p>
<p>根據這個實例，人類可活到一百五十二歲而沒有多大之老衰象徵，祇要生殖腺衛生得當。所以我們人類，在最低限度，可以活到這個年齡，況且今日與昔日不同，醫學和其他的科學非常發達，如近數年中奧國生理學大師的發明生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」卽為此學說樹立基礎的明證，綜觀各國醫學雜誌，備載名醫實騐此製劑功效的報告，可無庸懷疑。例如德國利用此劑以治療性神經衰弱患者。同時將同樣的女用製劑以治療不姙和月經不調，發育不全的女公民，獲效者每月竟達數萬以上；如謂此功效尚難滿足科學家的慾望，則英，法等國利用此製劑以減少煙民，據調查所得，「生殖素」之培補戒煙，已為國聯會所採用，法國的「禁煙同盟會」在三個月中竟藉此製劑戒絕十五年以上的癮君子四二八人，十年以上七六五人，五年以上三八九六人，三年以上計有七六五三人之多云。觀此可知生殖腺素製劑的功效，已啟示人類生命延長的福音！</p>
<p>人參，燕窩為國人預防衰老的唯一依賴，而各國成名的科學家曾不肖一顧，同時中國人死亡率的特別超格，已使此種落伍補齊將有淘汰之虞。</p>
<p>曾在華旅居北平三年的德國名醫Dr.William　T.Rabinack語人：「深信中國人如能循科學的原理以求滋補，或為將來不老長生術之首先發明國亦未可知，惜其所取之途徑跡近文字之遊戲，故雖有人參燕窩為補劑，而返不若國外之求科學以長生來得要益」云云，冬令將臨，進補其時，國人鑒此警語，亦將有所更弦易張乎？</p>

<p>患者張新春，年二十一歲，浙江杭縣人，主訴——幼時讀書，算術成績特優，十六歲時，為淫書所誘，手淫成習，自以為樂，初尚無何等影響，半年以後，漸覺演算之時，構思遲鈍，常不能順利解決，一年以後成績猛降，教師亦為之驚異，同將常覺精神不寗，始知手淫危害，急行戒除，卽有遺精，有時有夢，有時無夢，日甚一日，甚至一夜遺至二次。無心讀書，記憶力幾有消失，易驚善怒，盜汗失眠，目眩頭昏，至十九歲，不得不退學休養，一年有餘，絕未改善。現在症——精關不固，體虛腎虧，內分泌反常。治療方法——利用歐美最新年之療法，先使服『希米脫氏固精片』，不出一月，遺精頓止，乃更投以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以補其虛弱，使持久常服至兩個月並施電療，身體逐漸強健，腦力恢復，神志清明，稍理舊課，順利非常，可重度其學校生活矣。</p>
<p>（二）重獲豔妻青睞的丈夫</p>
<p>患者莫天蔭，年三十歲，廣東潮州人，主訴——少曾犯手淫之習，幸卽戒除，而發育不足，婚後早洩，大為豔妻所輕。病歷——十七歲時，春情難遏，犯手淫經年，極少間斷，後閱書知其流毒，勉力或除，廿六歲結婚，其妻極美，乃謀縱歡，不意已患早洩，且陰具較常人為小，雖極意奉承，終難得婦人歡心。現在症——發育不全及早洩。治療方法——莫君之疾皆因手淫傷及發育機能所致，唯一方法為強壯其生殖腺使局部發育完美，並促使其機能歸於正常，故投以大量生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，並以電療手術為補助。一個月後半月後，立收奇功，發育完全，早洩痊愈，大得其妻之歡心，特來診所道謝，且稱道『生殖素』之奇效不止云。（按『生殖素』用鐵盒裝，其紙盒瓶裝者概係僞造影射之假藥，故惟有購用真貨，方能發生效力。『希米脫氏固精片』亦然，均裝鐵盒。其僞藥非特無效，且以配製不善，服後必有流弊。）</p>

<p>青年壯健之時，人們每以自己精力過人自負。有的為着自炫，在工作場中，運動場上，幹着超過他體力能負担的　事。有的食於尋歡，縱慾忘返。日子稍久，身體已受損傷，在陰濕天氣或過勞以後，覺得骨節間微微痠痛。當時自覺精力超越，不以為意，依舊的浪費着精力，　延久之，骨痛病就深植於這人的身上。到了中年，逢節大發，鬧得彎腰曲背，老態龍鍾，攬鏡自照，竟不知當年的精力何往，悔亦無用了。</p>
<p>因此，你總得留意小心，發覺骨痛初起，趕緊購「強斯登氏骨痛片」自療。這是骨痛病的唯一特效藥，藥力能深入骨髓，去毒除瘋，卽係久年骨痛，已至半身不遂的地步，也能澈底的根治，休說初起的輕症了。不過你早一天治療卽可少受一天的痛苦，你那龍馬般的精神不亦可以少受點磨損嗎？</p>
<p>你曾無節制地縱慾尋歡嗎？你曾不顧一切地浪費體力嗎？你曾飽嘗艱苦，多受風寒嗎？如果你有過這樣的事實，你就有種下骨痛病的種子的可能，就該注意有無骨節痠痛之時，有的說話就宜速治，日子久後，『強斯登氏骨痛片』雖仍能立收奇效，你的痛苦却太深了。</p>

<p>吸鴉片的易以成癮，原因由於人體的細胞，尤其是生命源泉的生殖腺的細胞，被煙毒侵入之後盡被麻醉，而將新陳代謝機能被烟毒喧賓奪主越俎代謀矣。故一旦停止煙量，各細胞亦不能恢復原來活動的能力，形成奄奄一息的狀態。必須吸入若干煙毒，方能由煙力的刺激以達興奮。千百之癮君子，因此之故，對於性的生活亦不能自主，故都罹陰萎早洩之症，即使欲行房事，亦必須借重於煙力，癮頭過足，方可一試。培補戒煙法的所以收效，由於『生殖素』的藥力，能使萎靡的生殖腺振作，同時能使千萬細胞自力更生，掙脫其被麻醉的羈絆，築成壯健無匹的抗毒堤防，故戒煙期中，絕無不安與痛苦之象，與他種藥劑祇能顧其一方面者，不能同日而語也。且煙癮一斷之後，而身體健康的基礎已早穩定，可保常年却病，其名實相符的功效，殊足驚人。</p>

<p>— 詹念曾醫師譯自美國醫學季刊</p>
<p>……十數年前威脅過美國民族的健康　……醫學進步掃除了整個人羣的隱憂　……最新療法你看是何等的簡易便利</p>
<p>十多年前，教育家和醫學家開始注意一種常見於青年人中的現象：許多康強，用功，敏慧的孩子，一向保持着優秀的成績，可是當他們達到了思春期的時候（卽是從十五六歲起），漸漸得憂　瘦削，腦力也遲鈍起來，成績落得很低，前後判若二人。這是什麽東西在那裏作怪呢？</p>
<p>經過大量的精密的調查，我們發現了這些青年人，大部在舉行激烈的手淫，手淫停止時，因為生殖腺已受損壞，精關寬馳，無不發生頻繁的遺精。生殖腺本是生命之源，旣然這樣，他們的體格當然要瘦弱，精神自然會恍忽。這種惡習因青年之相互引誘，社會上之佈滿着性的刺激而流行日廣。</p>
<p>這批青年長大起來自然都是不能耐勞，智力體力剛俱低劣的神經衰弱者，他們日後所生的孩子也一定會承襲所有的弱點。整個民族的健康於是受到威脅了。有識之士講起了手淫遺精，不禁談虎色變，無不引為美國前任的隱憂。這種注意使得不少一知半解的醫者，配製些不痛不癢　庸藥，自稱為遺精的惟一良藥。</p>
<p>這些無效的藥劑使人們的杞憂更深，以為對於此病，醫藥無靈的了。這種無謂的憂慮，自用了希米脫氏的鞏固精　法以後，方一掃而空。這最新的療法包含兩種步驟：第一，服用『希米脫氏固精片』可以立止遺精，使精關鞏固，不致再任意流出或於夢中顛鸞倒鳳。第二，普通的療法於治癒遺精後，常認為已經大功告成，不知那遺精所造成的瘦削恍忽，記憶力薄弱，四肢乏力，陰萎早洩，發育不全，決不是任何固精藥所能同時收效的。口才應再服大量生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以療治其虛弱。</p>
<p>這兩種藥互相輔助，成為溺於手淫遺精的性神經衰弱者的二大救星，單用『固精片』，身體的健康無法　進；單有『生殖素』而不先塞其遺洩，則服藥後所得之新精力，依舊流出體外，無從得益。他們至少有兩大優點：一是效力強大；二是服用便利，只消吞下片劑，無注射之煩，適合於病家自療。因此這種療法遂為全美國　醫生和病人所採用，而遺精病就迅速地被人們克服了。</p>

<h3 id="c181">發育不全的科學挽救 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<p>發育不全的範圍頗廣，如體格矮小，手足畸形，骨骼軟弱，先天不足及性器短小等是。通常大都指導性器而言，故本文的討論範圍，亦以性器為主。</p>
<p>性器短小，是發育不全的一種症象，其原因可分先天性與後天性兩種。所謂先天性，則因性器畸形，或在發育途中各種內分泌腺（例如松果腺，腦下垂體，甲狀腺，胸腺，副腎，生殖腺等。）疾病異常而致性器短小。</p>
<p>後天性者較先天性為多。主要因生殖腺發生障碍，原因由於濫用性器不加節制，尤其幼年時之手淫行為，妨害發育最烈，使性器短小，又包莖亦有抑制發育之傾向。</p>
<p>關於性器的發育法，在最近已經研究出來，基於內分泌學說，用生殖腺製劑『生殖素』，可以催促生殖腺機能，同時使有協力作用之其他內分泌腺之作用亢盛，所以性器自會發育長大，德國名醫郝爾特博士Dr.William　L.Holt用同樣『女用生殖素』將一位已達十九齡的處女，月經不調，缺乏曲線美，乳房硬固而小，陰毛不多，服以此製劑後，遂俄然變成豐滿可愛的處女了。同時意大利羅馬大學生理學教授蘇侖納斯（Soronus）在三年中，曾將性器短小，罹有陰萎，早洩的男子共三千餘人盡用此劑治癒。</p>

<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>……本症在中年後最易罹患　……有效藥品的發明殊寥寥</p>
<p>我從半身不遂患者兩百五十餘人中，調查其情況，結果，判明百分之九十八以上都有骨痛病源，而且起先都屬輕微的酸痛感覺，盡發作在腰背手足及兩肩膀等處。卽此足以證明本症失治後的趨向，不能不否認含有嚴重的危險性。</p>
<p>關於骨痛惡化致惹成半身不遂症一節，過去各學者均有舉例證實。其內容雖有若干差異，但在大體上，都認本症若不早期治療，確有變成嚴重的中風危險。這實是一件不能忽視的事情。所以在一切可怕的病中，在中年人的最易罹患者，要算本症了。因此應有首先調查骨痛的有效療法必要了。</p>
<p>世上有很多的人，工作稍勞後每感覺腰背酸痛，除完全因體力薄弱之外，厥為血份不潔與尿酸過多及瘋濕內蘊，因此之故，對於本症的擇藥。不僅須求具有除去上述病源的藥力，尚須求其含有預防動脈硬化的成分。職是之故，目前對症的骨痛藥，除美國強斯登博士所發明的科學處方『強斯登氏骨痛片』之外，絕無具有同樣功效的藥片問世。關於『強斯登氏骨痛片』的功效，在歐美由千百名醫作無數次的臨床實騐，均得美滿的功效，始得發表於五大洲的各國醫刊，與讀者作普遍的介紹。</p>

<h3 id="c183">涇渭分後又如何 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>本月十六日，「起首老店」的上海嚮導社有一則啟事說：「本社同人前鑒於時勢之需要，爰於去年八月中首先創設上海嚮導社，深望社會人士之匡扶，以獲得美滿之結果，奈何時人不諒，悮解嚮導之眞諦，致新興事業，日趨於惡化，殊非同人等始願所及，爰於本月十五日宣吿歇業，以示涇渭，……」</p>
<p>看看報上分類廣吿中嚮導社所登的廣吿，那些帶着誘惑性的妙句，說是「悮解嚮導之眞諦，致新興事業，日趨於惡化，」大槪並不見得是寃枉，所以對社會局「妥擬辦法，其以眞正導遊爲目的者，當予存在，否則槪予禁止」的原則，也就覺得很對。「其以眞正導遊爲目的者，常予存在，否則槪予禁止」的辦法，說說固然很對很容易，但要認明「以眞正導遊爲原則」和「否則」，則就沒有寫幾個字這麽容易了，不僅不容易，並且還很難。而且，卽使涇渭分了，又如何辦法呢？</p>
<p>很難的原因，就在於如何認明「眞正以導遊爲原則」，和「名爲嚮導而暗操不正當之營業」，我們來看看嚮導社的前身，據我們知道的，則現在的嚮導社大都是由以前的跳舞學校所蛻變，嚮導員也大都就是以前跳舞學校的舞女，因爲跳舞學校被禁止了，她們的生活吿訴她們有嚮導員可做，因之她們就做了嚮導員，一旦嚮導社再被禁止，則就卽使說不淪爲私娼，她們的生活也會吿訴她們去做其他「名爲××而暗操不正當之營業一的。</p>
<p>所以我們就退一步來說，算是嚮導事業從此之後是淸一色的「眞正以導遊爲目的」了，然而「槪予禁止」下來的呢？她們如果要生存下去，大槪飯總得吃，衣總得依舊穿，房子總得依舊住的。</p>
<p>然而就因之而不「妥擬辦法了嗎？當然不對，這是因噎廢食。不過如果以頭痛醫頭的辦法就認爲是永久的辦法，或者等脚痛了再來醫脚，而不設法根治，這病人遲早是會死的。</p>
<p>我這種也就算提出我的忠吿。</p>

<p>— 芳子</p>
<p>魯迅先生：</p>
<p>在寂寞的長道上，你孤獨地苦鬥着。始終，正如你所說的你是一頭倔强的牛，一些都不肯放鬆地抓住每一件事情去搏戰。你努力地向前耕種，直到停止你的最後一跳的脈搏。你敎訓我們：我們得幹着；我們年靑人得幹。在莊嚴的民族革命的旗幟下，我們脚踏實地的幹，幹得一滴是一滴。</p>
<p>在你的生命中有的只是工作。「你不曉得什麽是休息，什麼是娛樂，工作工作，死的前一日還在執筆，……」—魯迅夫人的哀詞，我們將忠實地工作，爲工作而犧牲。</p>
<p>我們被關在一間屋里，沒有空氣，沒有光綫，舊禮敎，惡勢力，帝國主義重重的包圍我們，侵略我們，我們窒悶得快將死去。但我們不甘心馴服的死去。我們要活！要新生！要向黑暗的壁壘進攻！先生，在這暴風雨的前夜，你挺身站起來，跟我們去衝鋒，毅然領導着我們赴前錢。</p>
<p>可是你—一個老戰士如今是長眠了。</p>
<p>「你沒有死，」我們大家都說你不會死的。可不是你的不朽的靈魂是永遠地活在我們每一個靑年人的跳躍的心里。你的血肉已經餵了我們，在你所散播的種子下，我們將爆發一個時代的怒波！</p>
<p>雖然我從來不曾見過你，但當我第一次瞻仰到你躺在萬國殯儀館里時，却又那麽地面熟，好像是一個素來我所敬仰的久別了的敎師。要是沒有周圍的肅穆悲壯的空氣在無形中阻止我，我幾乎禁不住要親熱地喊出來：「魯迅先生！」</p>
<p>我瞥見在你的旁邊有一套文具。這一套文具呵，是你的戰艦，你的砲彈，它曾經殺退了數不淸的敵人。這鋒利的筆尖是一個照妖鏡，它毫不留情的把罩在表面的面幕全都揭了下來，他是魑魅，還他個魑魅：他是魍魎。還他個魍魎；它曾經激發了多少人的思想，鼓動了多少人的精神。</p>
<p>秋陽伴着哀歌，悲痛和着熱忱，無數的學生，工友以及作家，明星從各個角落里滙集在一起懷着哀悼和敬意的情緒自動地來送葬。</p>
<p>「……他是我們民族靈魂，他是新時代的號聲，喚起大衆來爭生存！他反抗帝國主義，他反抗黑暗勢力，一生到老志不屈，始終爲着革命而努力：我們底導師」歌詞跟着隊伍的羣衆震盪。</p>

<p>小平拿石筆在底下加了一座砲台，這東西算是給砲火轟完了。</p>
<p>於是大家笑了起來：</p>
<p>「我們勝利的了！我們勝利了啊！」喊着一班人分作二個陣容，彼此爬在地面上，拿石筆很命亂劃着。……</p>
<p>「呃！大家來畫個爽快吧！你們五個人畫飛機，大砲，兵艦，……我們畫大兵，這是我們勇敢的兵士，來抵抗你們啊！瞧瞧看，個個多神氣……」</p>
<p>陸小平邊畫邊嚷：身子滾在泥堆裏，一件長衫像什麽東西喲，白一塊，黑一塊，不成模樣了。</p>
<p>「好了！我們有一，二，三……」一共六架飛機，五個大砲了。開火吧！」</p>
<p>「慢點，慢點！」徐世昌說：「再等我二大隊大兵開到，好動手了！」</p>
<p>大兵是什麽？原來寫一個丁字，上面裝個人頭，下而畫二個脚，肩上架一枝洋槍啊！</p>
<p>一會兒，雙方都住手了。但見滿地白的綫劃，他們却視作一個　大的戰地。</p>
<p>「小平！你們洋槍放啊！」</p>
<p>「嚎！放了他」他連滾帶跌地跳過三四尺，算攻進了敵人陣綫。</p>
<p>「砰碰！」</p>
<p>你也砰碰，他也砰碰，大家砰砰碰碰……</p>
<p>大家攬作一團糟，畫飛機的來不及投彈，抓把泥土摔上去，連手裏的石筆也當作了砲珠。可是小平們一夥人眞勇敢，上前去用脚跟把飛機，兵艦，大砲統扔個精光，結果應錦良的一方算是失敗了。</p>
<p>小平，徐世昌，陸家駒，抹着一頭汗珠，搶嘴挾舌的喊着：</p>
<p>「開火要大家有團結心，團結是勝利的，大家「團結」起來！」</p>
<p>歸隊了。小羔羊們仍在夜色迷朦中，踏着勝利的步伐，像一羣長途的征人，浩浩盪盪離開了這塊地方。</p>
<p>大家再唱個山歌啊！</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>養猪的把猪養在「山巴」（一）每天，帶着扁擔到附近的商舖里去，用着低廉的代價向「阿總」（二）們購買人家吃下的剩食　飯粒呀，菜羹呀，腥味魚屑和餘殘的肉片，……二大桶二大桶地挑回來，喂着肥胖的猪，等候長大了賣給人家宰殺。</p>
<p>這年鄰近發生了猪瘟。畜牲們一匹一匹地像蒼蠅碰到寒冷天，今天才好好地，明天便突然死去了。政府每天有警察到鄉下，査騐死猪的埋葬。養猪的人們發生了恐慌，「山巴」里的每個家庭，都受着災難的襲擊了。</p>
<p>陳大弟向着李阿虎說道：</p>
<p>「不得了！我的老婆私孩子要餓癟肚皮了！」</p>
<p>李阿虎答道：「誰又不是呢？多倒運，去年我才把唐山的家眷帶來，今年便有橫禍了。莫不是我的老婆是尅夫星？」</p>
<p>可是阿虎的心里倒還是鎭定着的。他的猪還犯不着災煞，一匹一匹地，健旺地生長着：會吃，也會睡。</p>
<p>「老天爺保佑我們吧！我們一家人從來是善良的，也不曾做過什麽惡事。」他向神明祈禱，並且向着惴惴着的溫良的婦人安慰道。</p>
<p>而婦人也每天到「伯公宮」去，請求「伯公」（三）的庇佑。</p>
<p>「大伯公呀！保護我們的一家子吧。我愛着我的丈夫，我也愛着我的四個孩子的，我今生沒有做惡，如果前世沒有修，讓我求伯公赦宥，我將來殺一只猪來酬謝您的神恩吧。」</p>
<p>村子越來越恐慌了。今天許家死了一匹猪，明天阿三家又死了一匹。最不幸的是陳大弟，整個的猪羣竟死剩二隻了：一母和一子。</p>
<p>哭聲從陳家的阿答屋里傳到李家來，令人聽起來也覺傷心。阿虎向着老婆問道：</p>
<p>「今天早上有去拜伯公麽？」</p>
<p>「天天去呀。誰敢不敬呢？」</p>
<p>李阿虎安心了。他又到市上去挑殘飯去。宰猪的老二頭家對他說道：</p>
<p>「阿虎，你的猪死剩了幾隻？沒有病麽？我下午要兩匹猪，兩匹。」</p>
<p>李阿虎驕傲地答道：</p>
<p>「嚇！人家的猪才會死絕呢！我的是好好的，好猪玀！不過，我同你說，價錢要大些。這年頭有什麽好畜牲？」</p>
<p>頭二頭家奸滑地笑道：</p>
<p>「那麽，你便賣給別人吧。不可不希罕，我寗願每天殺少了幾頭。虧本生意誰也不願做的。」</p>
<p>李阿虎肚里一沈，覺得有些不妥：如果那些猪也會死去呢？這年頭說敢保得牢，</p>
<p>於是他皺一皺眉頭，轉一轉灣子。</p>
<p>「老二頭家，話得說回來。大家老主顧，難道我好意里趁風打橄欖，敲你的竹槓？你便同我抬去吧。」</p>
<p>在咖啡店里裝飽了吐子，李阿虎覺得他的主張還不錯。於是同着老二頭家在回家的路上，談着他家的幸運，簡直是眉飛色舞了。</p>
<p>「眞是虧得大伯公保佑，才有這好運氣呢！」這麽光榮地說着。</p>
<p>可是在離着家幾十步的地方，他便隱隱地聽得好像是老婆好孩子們的哭聲了。他的心一沈，皺一皺眉頭，却還安慰着自己：「或許會別一家子吧？這麽凑巧！」便三步搶做兩步，衝到家里去了。</p>
<p>一進門嚇得他張起了大嘴巴。老婆蓬松着頭髪，在祖宗們的神龕前哭着，頓着脚。孩子們圍着她哭。他不說一句話，便跑到猪牢去，不好了，眼前陳列着三具硬僵僵的猪的屍體，猪籠里被官家掃射了許多藥水。</p>
<p>「完了！完了」他的心哭道。便跑到屋里來，向老二頭家勉强地裝上了笑臉，說道：</p>
<p>「還好，還好１你趕快抬走兩區去吧。」</p>
<p>老二頭家看着情形不妙，便奸滑地沈下了臉，說道：</p>
<p>「對不起，我不敢要了．馬打（四）會罰錢的。」</p>
<p>便元自走了。</p>
<p>李阿虎一呆。一陣無名的憤怒突然從他的心上浮起。抓起老婆來，便重重地一拳。</p>
<p>「敗家精呀！你……」他咒道。</p>
<p>猪牢里又有畜牲的尖銳的哀呌聲。報吿着又有猪玀死去了。</p>

<p>— 兪于魚</p>
<p>自從醫師診斷了是初期肺病以後，家里人擾着我要求我尊重醫師的信條每天早上到公園去散步。能够持恒着每大上公園去散步確是最好的攝生法，卽是沒有肺病的人；不過我每天要做一個規定時間的工作，否則我們一家人的胃囊都要停止活動了。那永恒的工作已經使我感到非常疲憊，現在再要在規定時間之外添加一項呌做「散步」的工作，眞是不勝其「負擔」了！但是妻子是愛護丈夫的，母親更加寵愛她的兒子，被兩重偉大的愛情壓迫着，我祇能帶了一份當天的報紙上公園散步了。我每天在小池佔了　只坐位，利用這時問來閱讀一點新聞，平常這項工作是放在晚餐後的，現在提早了十二小時，或許是散步給我最直接的利益了。</p>
<p>這樣幾個月來成了習慣。因爲這項添加的工作還相當輕鬆，而且是把讀報的時間對調的，雖然每天要早一點鐘離開被窗，實際上還不致十分吃虧，至於對於初期肺病本身衛生之什麽效力，那是誰也無法推測的。</p>
<p>每天到這公園來散步的人很多，他們是眞眞來散步的，徘來徊去。我常常在讀報之餘，計算着有些人在池子邊要兜過多少圈子，或者一對情人一樣的西洋人走完一片草地要費去幾分鐘？像我那樣從進來到出去直坐在池邊的恐怖就是題目上的他們祖孫兩個了，不過這關係也是由我推測的，或許是兒子也說不定。</p>
<p>現在就當作祖孫的關係來說吧，祖父的年紀至少在五十開外了，飄着一頭銀灰色的長長的頭髮，如果放在西洋油畫中，他一定是一位偉大的詩人。不過他穿得是破舊，那倒不是不修邊幅，長袍角邊的破洞都很齊整地用同一顏色的布綴過了，至多祗能說他是個儉樸的老人。那孫兒有七八來歲吧，比他祖父漂亮得多了，夏天是麻紗的吊帶童裝，現在是絨綫的衫褲了，再過幾天我猜想他一定有一件漂亮的大衣的。</p>
<p>他們和我差不多時候到公園，却總是我先走，我不是說過每天有規定的時間要工作嗎？他們一來也總是到池邊坐了，祖父坐在椅子上，孫兒坐在草地上，於是開始他們的早餐，是一包餅干和一只麵包，餅干是孫兒的，老頭子嚼着堅硬的麵包。之後，孫兒在草地上翻來覆去，從沒有一刻停歇的時候，祖父則像一尊佛龕里供着的菩薩，閉目養神，偶然翕動眼皮，也祇瞧一眼草地上的孫兒又合上了。</p>
<p>在秋天到來的時候，他們有幾天沒有到公園來。過一天又遇見他們時候，老頭子的精神更頹廢了，他也沒有吃麵包，就睡倒在草地上讓他的孫兒在池邊打水，竹片激着水面刺刺」的聲音，他裝做沒有聽見，—或許他眞的被別種思想牽住了。</p>
<p>於是我也「思想」起來，那個老頭兒或許每天也有規定的時間要做工作，那永恒的工作將使他比我更疲憊，不過他寵愛他的孫兒，就添加了這一項「散步」的工作。他自然是不勝其「負擔」的，每天閉目養神大槪就是預備耗費到規定的工作上的…</p>
<p>這猜測是毫無根據的，亦幾乎是幻想。但我的思慮已經被那圈子限定了，我每天從這出發點推測到更遠的將來，我希望老頭子長壽，希望他再貪婪地每天嚼一只堅硬的麵包。</p>
<p>人類是被一種偉大的愛聯系着的，祖父之於孫兒之母親之於兒子，妻子之於丈夫…在這偉大的愛情壓迫下决定了每個人的生活。</p>
<p>每天的散步恐將同規定工作一樣延長下去，因爲我不敢去問那診斷我的醫師我的初期肺病已經進展（自然更希望變得好一點）到什麽程度了？</p>

<p>風調雨順慶昇平。唐明皇是，寡人好色愛傾城。後宮粉黛無顏色。惟有，梅妃才貌獨超羣，眉如柳。髮如雲。花容月貌麗天生。風流天子承恩澤。月下花前共晨昏。眞所謂，情意緾綿似海深。誰知道，掩袖工讒楊氏女。娥眉新選入宮門。爭寵奪愛心妬嫉。狐媚徧能惑至尊。從此隔院笙鼓喧天鬧，我這裏凄凉寂寞滿院庭。秋水欲穿馬不臨。戀新歡。亡舊人。男子從來是薄情。秋風未起團扇捐。哭壞了，世上多少美人心。梅妃是，獨自想思廻腸斷。祇有蠟炬有心墮淚到天明。不多時，胡兒叛逆登金殿。原為那百媚千嬌楊太眞。暴風狂雨催得緊。紅粉佳人斷了魂。端留那，香骨凄凉葬梅林。</p>

<p>黛玉不减舊丯姿。漸漸精神復舊時。金　不加鬆髮。羅衣寬褪瘦腰肢。那寶玉暗先窺覺。便婉轉音聲勸慰之。當此畫屏秋色好。藥燼烟裏鬥新詩。你看這。妙窗影天然圖。銀燭秋光絕妙詞。倘是你故故撫床常獨臥。怕不被嫦娥窺見笑人痴。迎春姊妹妍然笑。說道行樂人生須及時。命紫娟卽刻排小宴。衆姊妹排坐不歉辭。木穉香送金樽滿。落紙揮毫不費思。寶玉却受金樽罰。早已白面泛胭脂。憑欄杆試望天邊月。缺陷全無大好時。寒露濛濛灑花枝。</p>

<p>(Hankou) Yang Yongtai died at 3:37 PM on the 25th at the Jianghan Customs House in Hankou. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yang Yongtai, with his wife, attended a banquet hosted by the American Consul at the Hankou An Li Ying Foreign Firm at noon on the 25th. Around 3 PM, when returning to Wuchang, the car arrived at the Jianghan Customs ferry dock. As they got out of the car, he was suddenly attacked by an assailant who fired three shots. Two bullets hit Yang, one entering from the left shoulder blade and exiting the right rib, striking a vital area. At the time, he remained calm and still intended to return to Wuchang. He was supported by Mrs. Yang and his guards onto the car and sent to Tongren Hospital in Special District One. Upon entering the hospital, he was still able to move and speak. After two injections of stimulants proved ineffective, he died from his injuries at 3:37 PM. The body was sent to the Bankers' Association to await funeral arrangements. One assailant was captured and temporarily detained at the Sixth Public Security Bureau awaiting strict interrogation. Military and political leaders gathered at the Bankers' Association to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the aftermath. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 3:15 PM on the 25th, Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, accompanied by his wife and a follower, returned from Hankou Jianghan Customs to Wuchang by crossing the river. Because there was no special ferry, they took an ordinary ferry. As they walked on the pedestrian path along the riverbank, just as they were about to step off the stairs, he was shot three times in the waist. Mr. Yang was then taken by car to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, he died at the hospital at 3:37 PM. The murderer, Chen Xiechao, was captured on the spot. He is 20 years old and from Sichuan. Mr. Yang's body was moved from Tongren Hospital to the Hankou Bankers' Association at 4:10 PM. The murderer is currently detained at the Public Security Bureau. Garrison Commander Chen Jicheng personally interrogated him. According to his confession, one bullet was fatal. Mr. Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government in Hankou, was assassinated and died here this afternoon. When Mr. Yang stepped out of his car at the customs dock, intending to board a ferry to Wuchang, a young Chinese man suddenly approached, drew a pistol from his sleeve, and fired several shots at Mr. Yang. One bullet entered Mr. Yang's flank, and he immediately fell to the ground, shouting that he had been injured. The murderer was immediately arrested by the police. Mrs. Yang and his guards carried Mr. Yang into a car and drove to the Japanese Hospital, but due to his severe injuries, he died within minutes of arriving at the hospital, at the age of 51. It is reported that one bullet had penetrated his kidney. After the incident occurred, there was a lot of noise and confusion, and the situation was extremely chaotic. Therefore, the accounts of what happened varied considerably. Some said that Mr. Yang's guards had fired at the assailant, but this could not be confirmed. Mr. Yang had attended a luncheon at the American Consulate in Hankou today, and was attacked when he intended to return to Wuchang after the meal. It is reported that the murderer is a young man from Sichuan named Chen Xiechao, only 20 years old. He was thoroughly interrogated tonight. Since taking office as Chairman of Hubei Province, Mr. Yang has made many improvements to provincial affairs. His assassination has caused great shock and grief among both Chinese and foreigners here. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, Suma, arrived in Tokyo, the leaders of the Foreign Ministry held two meetings on the evening of the 24th to hear Suma's report and discuss Japan's countermeasures. Late at night, Suma visited Toyoda, the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, and talked for more than an hour. It is reported that Suma, in view of the fact that the irresponsible publication of the contents of the Nanjing negotiations by the Japanese newspapers is detrimental to diplomatic work, should be strictly prohibited, and suggested controlling public opinion and maintaining diplomatic secrecy. Regarding this point, many opinions were expressed at the Foreign Ministry meeting on the evening of the 24th. The Foreign Ministry is scheduled to continue holding important meetings on the 25th. Japan's final attitude may be decided on the evening of the 25th. In other news, the military believes that the failure to achieve success in the current negotiations has long been expected. In the future, Japan has no need to stick to negotiations with the National Government, but should negotiate with appropriate negotiating partners in North China. It is reported that the sixth meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Kawagoe is scheduled to be held on the 26th. The Asahi Shimbun published a commentary on the 25th entitled "The Difficulties of Sino-Japanese Negotiations," which concluded that China should not insist on its delaying tactics, and Japan's rashness is also, in fact, doomed to failure. China and Japan should consider that if Sino-Japanese negotiations fail, serious misfortunes for both countries will follow. Therefore, although there are currently two most difficult issues, North China and anti-communism, efforts should still be made to resolve them. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Then, he reported the opinions of officials stationed in China. (25th Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on the report of Consul-General Suma, the leaders of the Foreign Ministry carefully discussed the policy for negotiations with China last night. According to the opinion of the Foreign Ministry authorities, both sides have exhausted their arguments in the current state of negotiations. Judging from the current situation, it is absolutely necessary to avoid leaving the negotiations in their current state. The Foreign Ministry is scheduled to consult with the Army and Navy authorities at 10:00 AM on the 26th, and then decide on Japan's final plan. Consul-General Suma was ordered to convey this instruction to Ambassador Kawagoe. (25th Domei Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Please Postpone the Collection of Income Tax on Savings Deposits - The Ministry of Finance Refuses Approval - Those Attempting to Evade Taxes and Flee with Funds - The Government Will Naturally Enforce the Law to Punish Them <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Tianjin and Chongqing Banking Associations submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance stating that, regarding the third category of the Income Tax Regulations (tax on interest income from savings deposits), Chinese banks should not be the first to implement it until foreign businesses can universally comply, as it affects rights and interests. They requested a postponement of implementation, but the Ministry of Finance refused. The reply stated that previously, the Shanghai Banking Association had submitted a request to the Ministry to postpone the start of collection. The date for the collection of income tax on interest from savings deposits had already been announced and implemented, and the collection methods had been meticulously prescribed. As for the issue of capital flight, since the Income Tax Regulations were promulgated, all sectors have recognized them as a good tax system with very light tax rates. Why would anyone evade such small taxes and violate the spirit of patriotism? In recent times, countries around the world have been implementing currency devaluation or expanding the amount of currency in circulation, and the value of their currencies changes from morning to night. Even property prices are difficult to standardize. As for those in China who deposit their property in foreign banks, their business operations and profit and loss situations cannot be understood. Only a fool would think of this. The pain that Chinese people have suffered in the past should be remembered. Why would anyone risk danger to avoid a small amount of tax? Even if there are a few unscrupulous people who attempt to evade taxes and flee with funds, the government will naturally enforce the law to punish them without any leniency. The claim that this is an overestimation. However, it is acknowledged that this is a novel undertaking, the procedures are complicated, and the time is pressing, making preparation difficult. As an expression of understanding, the start date for the collection of income tax on interest from savings deposits will be temporarily postponed until January 1, 1937. The income tax on interest from public bonds should still be collected from October 1, according to the original schedule. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Shanghai Municipal Council's Austerity Policy <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is facing significant financial difficulties due to the decline of commerce within the Concession. According to the report for the first half of this year, the Council's total debt for this year is likely to exceed one million dollars. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation, the budget for the next year will be short by around three and a half million dollars. To balance income and expenditure, the Council considered increasing the tax rate from 14% to 16%, but this was not implemented due to opposition from citizens. Recently, the Council decided to adopt an austerity policy. In principle, this is something that citizens can agree with. However, so far, the austerity policy announced by the Council is not satisfactory to us. First, the Council has made significant revisions to the treatment regulations for middle and lower-level civil servants. For example, detectives with monthly salaries of twenty or thirty dollars originally received twelve dollars a month for transportation expenses. This transportation allowance has now been cancelled, which will inevitably have a significant impact on their lives. However, there have been no significant changes to the treatment of senior foreign staff who receive large monthly salaries and have allowances for rent and education expenses. Moreover, according to a recent Western newspaper report, a certain foreign staff member who served in the Council for only eight and a half years will, after this dismissal, receive one and a half years' salary and a lifelong pension of 800 pounds per year. This huge expenditure on retired personnel, although said to be due to contractual relationships, is ultimately unreasonable in the current austerity climate. Second, the Council has decided to disband the Intelligence Office and the Rickshaw Affairs Committee at the end of this year. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee is a temporary agency, and after its disbandment, its work will be transferred to the Police Department, which is not a problem. However, the disbandment of the Intelligence Office is really worth considering. Although it has only been established for a little over five years, it is one of the most meaningful auxiliary agencies of the Council. The Council's motivation for establishing the office was that the Council was stimulated by the May Thirtieth Movement and felt that there should be a permanent agency for communication between the municipal authorities and the citizens to eliminate emotional barriers between the two sides. After the establishment of the office, because people were employed well, it was indeed able to fulfill this mission. In recent years, it has not only added a lot of information about the Public Concession's municipal administration to the newspapers, but the Council's administrative policies have also been greatly influenced by the office's diligent attention to public opinion. In any case, in terms of administrative efficiency, the existence of the Intelligence Office is necessary. Now that the Council has decided to disband the office, the savings in expenditure, according to the Council's announcement, is only 46,000 dollars per year. If we deduct the salary of the intelligence assistant who will take over part of the office's responsibilities, then the annual savings will definitely not reach 40,000 dollars. In the difference in next year's budget, it will only be able to make up about one percent of the amount. Since the disbandment of the Intelligence Office has such limited significance for the Council's finances, we hope that before the office is disbanded, the Council's board of directors will give this issue appropriate consideration.</p>
<p>In short, if the Council implements austerity, it should focus on overly extravagant and unnecessary areas. Rather than reducing the living expenses of lower-level civil servants, it is better to reduce the generous extra allowances of senior civil servants. Rather than disbanding agencies that are related to the majority of citizens, it is better to disband agencies that are related to a minority of citizens. Among the citizens of the Public Concession, the number of Chinese people is over 1.12 million, while the number of foreigners is less than 40,000. However, some of the undertakings carried out by the Council focus on the welfare of a minority of foreigners. We propose that the Council's austerity should start from those departments.</p>

<p>Indianapolis - Republican presidential candidate Landon, in his campaign speech today, for the first time discussed foreign policy, saying that the United States must be realistic and strictly neutral to avoid war. He also said that to seek world peace, it is necessary to revive international trade, reduce economic barriers, cultivate international goodwill, and reduce the arms race. The United States must do its best to avoid disputes arising from the League of Nations, international courts, or sanctions. President Roosevelt's assistance in sanctioning countries to oppose Italy shows the contradiction in his foreign policy. (24th National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e44">French Radical Party Resolves to Maintain the People's Front, Six Political Principles, Urging the Government to Implement Them <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Biarritz, France – The congress of the Radical Socialist Party concluded this afternoon at 8:00 PM. The resolution proposed by the party leader, Minister of National Defense Daladier, was unanimously passed. The resolution was a compromise of proposals from various factions and was drafted with the consent of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Herriot, Minister without Portfolio Zay, and former Prime Minister Sarraut. The resolution asserted that the Radical Socialist Party should continue to support the People's Front cabinet while not abandoning the party's main political principles. The resolution began by quoting the famous "Declaration of the Rights of Man" promulgated during the French Revolution, stating that the "Declaration of the Rights of Man" is the fundamental law of democracy, which stipulates that private property shall not be infringed. Occupying factories, farms, and shops harms the freedom of the people and cannot be tolerated. The resolution then listed the various political principles of the Radical Party, stating that they must be fully adopted. These political principles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Safeguarding international peace and respecting the constraints stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations; (2) Strengthening national defense; (3) Maintaining domestic order, abiding by the rule of law, dissolving and disarming all illegal organizations; (4) Resolving social disputes through mediation and compulsory arbitration; (5) Maintaining national authority and not allowing it to be undermined in any way, especially not allowing it to be manipulated and utilized by large corporations; (6) Striving to balance the budget.</p>
<p>The final paragraph of the resolution stated, "The Radical Socialist Party Congress hereby expresses its trust in the representatives of this party participating in the current government and requests them to continue to safeguard the implementation of the various political principles of the Radical Party within the scope of the government's actions." Before the opening of this Radical Socialist Party Congress, there was widespread fear that the party might withdraw from the People's Front due to the activities of the Communist Party and social unrest. Now that the above resolution has been unanimously passed by the congress, indicating continued participation in the People's Front and support for the current government, the French political situation will be clarified, like seeing a blue sky after clearing away the clouds.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Heated Debate During Political Discussions <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Biarritz – The Radical Socialist Party Congress continued its session this afternoon, discussing general political issues. After intense debate, the draft resolution of the party leader Daladier was unanimously passed (see separate dispatch). When the congress convened this afternoon, Minister without Portfolio Zay gave a speech, requesting that the representatives attending the congress use moderate language when expressing their opinions to avoid triggering a terrible political tide. Zay said that Prime Minister Blum must strive to maintain a balance between the left and right factions within the People's Front and that his task was extremely difficult and should be forgiven. Then, Mr. Campinchi, the chairman of the Radical Socialist Party's parliamentary group and the rapporteur on general political issues, gave a speech, acknowledging that the current political unrest was caused by social turmoil, and therefore, the occupation of factories by workers must be opposed, lest foreigners think that France has become Bolshevik. Regarding the Communist Party, he said that the Communist Party's policy changes were too sudden, and its proclaimed patriotism was also too exaggerated. However, since the Paris riots of February 6, 1934, the Communist Party has consistently expressed its determination to safeguard the republican system, which the Radical Socialist Party cannot forget. Next, Mr. Roche, the leader of the Northern Department branch, stated that it was a great mistake for the Radical Party to join the People's Front hand in hand with the Communist Party because the Communist Party regarded the People's Front as a prelude to the establishment of a Soviet system. Although the Communist Party swore to fight for peace and bread, it actually held meetings every day to agitate and restrain the government's actions, which could be said to be breaking its promises. Next, Mr. Kessel, a member of parliament of the Radical Socialist Party, gave a speech, saying, "This party should now declare that it will no longer tolerate the occupation of factories by workers. However, we should also guarantee the labor class that the new social laws promulgated by the government must be implemented uniformly, and even the most stubborn employers must abide by them." Regarding the Communist Party, he said that the Radical Party would never break with any group in the People's Front and that the People's Front must unite to jointly defend the republic and the motherland. Next, Mr. Banat, a member of the Radical Socialist Party, stated that once the People's Front collapsed, people like Laval and Doumergue (both former prime ministers) would inevitably stage a comeback, and the harm would be unimaginable. Now, in order to preserve the internal unity of the People's Front, both employers and employees must abide by order. Next, former Minister of the Interior Marchandeau stated that members of the Radical Party should not forget their original political principles and should not allow outsiders to doubt the true radicalism. Fascism and communism both deceive the people, and their dangers are the same. We must not be blinded by them. Next, former Minister of Education Gno stated that the Radical Socialist Party should continue to participate in the People's Front government because there would be no way to produce a majority in parliament without the cooperation of the Socialist Party. Moreover, the current government has completed various reforms thoroughly and quickly, so that the people and the parliament can be harmonious. Finally, Minister of National Defense Daladier gave a speech, refuting Roche's attack on the Communist Party, saying, "Today, the whole of Europe is competing in new mysticism, but we are not. We have nothing mystical to say. We French people have our own social ideals and are not a rabble." At this point, Daladier read out the draft resolution, which was unanimously passed by the congress. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Toulouse – Prime Minister Blum delivered a long speech at the theater here today, reiterating his belief in the People's Front government, saying that he would certainly be able to show something in the government's various undertakings in the future. He also said, "The most profound meaning of the current political experience lies in determining whether the coalition government of republican democracy and labor class democracy can act effectively without deviating from the methods of democracy and damaging the principles of freedom. I believe that we will be able to present concrete evidence to the world to reach a consensus, that is, the various social laws passed by our parliament are based on the freedom of organization of the labor class and the joint cooperation of all those who participate in creating the country." Blum continued, "If a socialist system can be established throughout the world, then war will not only be impossible but will also become inconceivable. Can democracy and democracy guarantee peace, or will they inevitably be subjugated by individual power? This is a difficult test being conducted in France, Europe, and even the world." Blum concluded his speech by saying, "We are striving to expand the negotiations among the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact in order to solve general European problems. In short, our political program is nothing else but trusting the diligent France and the peaceful Europe." (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Madrid – Political circles here expressed great satisfaction with the Soviet Union's decision to effectively withdraw from the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War, hoping that they would be able to purchase military supplies from the Soviet Union in the future, which would quickly change the war situation and benefit the government. The panic in the capital cannot be concealed, but since former Minister of the Interior General Pozas was appointed commander-in-chief of the government army, the residents have become more optimistic. Pozas served as the director of the security forces in the early stages of the rebellion and showed his wisdom in protecting the capital. The government militia has now been properly organized in accordance with military law, so it is no longer as undisciplined as before. The difficulties of lacking war materials are expected to be eliminated. At the same time, General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the National Army, has ordered his troops to temporarily stop attacking the capital so that the soldiers can rest. However, its air force is still very active, bombing the government troops' positions every day with the aim of destroying the morale of the defending troops and destroying the government troops' trenches. The National Army claims to have broken through the second line of defense of the government troops in Mostoles, twelve miles from the capital. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The government is now actively reorganizing the supreme command and appointing former Minister of the Interior Pozas as commander-in-chief of the central front. Pozas told reporters from this agency that the morale of the government troops is now very high. Currently, the fiercest fighting is in the area of Illescas (more than 30 kilometers southwest of the capital), that is, between the city and the road from Madrid to Aranjuez. The rebel army is now attacking the area from the north, using artillery to bombard on land and airplanes to bomb from the air. Therefore, the government troops had to withdraw from the towns of Borox and Cesiña. When the rebel planes attacked, the reporter from this agency was on the scene and suffered a slight injury to the neck. The government troops fought bravely regardless of their lives, and their loyalty is admirable. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Burgos – Special dispatch from the reporter of this agency: The National Army is now taking the offensive on two main fronts, one is in the direction of Madrid, and the other is advancing from the city of Oviedo in the northwest towards the city of Gijón. The entire line in the direction of Madrid is fifty kilometers wide, and in some places, especially in the area of Navalcarnero southwest of the capital, it has reached 35 kilometers from the city of Madrid. In addition, the city of El Escorial northwest of the capital can be captured at any moment, but the government troops are trying to open a road in front of the city. As for the area of Oviedo, the National Army has defeated the government troops and is pursuing them towards the port of Gijón and the city of Trobia. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Madrid – The Spanish capital is prepared for enemy air raids today. Residents are looking up at the sky, so that all normal activities have completely stopped. The number of vehicles and pedestrians on the road has been greatly reduced. However, there are still male and female orators shouting loudly in the streets and alleys, striving for resistance in order to win. Now that the rebel army has intensified its encirclement, the capital's food is also in danger. However, the government leaders have no intention of surrendering and know that after the rebel army wins, all trade unions will not be able to exist. Therefore, they have ordered trade union members between the ages of 18 and 40 to abandon their jobs and join the army. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Madrid – Special dispatch from the reporter of this agency accompanying the army on the front line in Illescas, south of the capital: After the government troops and the National Army clashed today on the road from Toledo to Madrid and the Tagus River, railway transportation between Madrid and the east has been cut off. From now on, Madrid can only communicate with the southeastern coastal city of Valencia via highway. It is said that three columns of the National Army are now advancing forward. One team is advancing north by ten kilometers and will cut off the road from the capital to Toledo. The other two columns are advancing east by fifteen kilometers and will cut off the railway from the capital to Cuenca. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Madrid – The government has just issued a bulletin stating that the militia composed of miners in Asturias Province in the northwest has now surrounded the city of Oviedo and successively occupied the three towns of Cairo, San Lazaro, and Xinmatinalia in the suburbs. As for the National Army in Toledo south of the capital and Aragon Province in the northeast, it was also repelled by the government troops. The infantry units belonging to the government army also advanced three kilometers in the south towards the city of Villabrang. However, according to a broadcast message issued by the National Army's radio station in La Coruña, the National Army is continuing to advance towards Madrid. After a fierce battle with the government troops, it has occupied the three villages of Cesena, Esquivias, and Borox. In this battle, more than 300 government troops were killed, many artillery pieces and machine guns were captured, and countless prisoners were taken, including many young girls. According to a broadcast message issued by the National Army's radio station in Seville, 40 National Army bombers and 42 fighter planes scattered leaflets over Madrid yesterday morning, warning residents to surrender immediately. By the afternoon, 160 more planes appeared in the sky to scatter leaflets. The National Army's radio station in La Coruña also issued a message confirming this incident, saying that the residents of the capital were greatly panicked when they saw a large number of planes circling in the sky, and many people were hit by bullets and injured. Yesterday, about 300 women held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of the Interior, demanding that the government surrender to the National Army, and they were dispersed by the police.

<p>(London) According to a message received here from the port of Istanbul, Turkey, a Soviet cargo ship passed through the Dardanelles Strait this morning and entered the Mediterranean Sea. The ship was carrying a large number of military armaments, especially many artillery pieces placed on the deck, which could be clearly seen. The newspapers also carried reports tonight that 30 Soviet cargo ships are now in the Mediterranean Sea, heading towards the port of Barcelona in Spain. Diplomatic circles here are very uneasy after hearing the news, believing that the Soviet Union had said that it would reserve the right to supply the Spanish government troops with military armaments depending on the situation of other countries providing assistance to the Spanish rebel army. What it said may have been put into practice. If so, it may cause serious incidents. According to news from Berlin, as a result of the talks between Italy and Germany, it has been decided to adopt a common attitude towards the internal turmoil in Spain and actively prevent other countries from providing assistance to the Spanish government troops. According to this, when Soviet cargo ships sail into Spanish ports, they may be intercepted by warships of certain countries, which is also unknown. The tense situation will then tend to be extreme. Political circles here commented on the Portuguese government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Spanish government, saying that Portugal now believes that Madrid is about to fall. At that time, the country will recognize the Spanish National Army government and dispatch formal envoys. As for Britain, it does not intend to regard the National Army government as a formal government, but only recognizes it as one of the belligerent groups. This is the same as when the Italian army captured the capital of Abyssinia, Britain recognized the commander-in-chief of the Italian army as the same example. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>(London) The British government sent a letter to the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee in the Spanish Civil War, which accused Russia of three violations of the non-intervention agreement and Italy of one violation. The letter was transmitted to the members of the committee late yesterday. The accusations against Russia were: (1) On October 18, the Russian ship "Stachei Bolshevik" arrived at the fortified port of Cartagena, 326 miles southeast of Madrid, and unloaded a total of 18 disassembled aircraft, 15 tanks, and more than 300 boxes of bombs and other military supplies; (2) About two weeks ago, the Spanish ship "Combes" also unloaded several artillery pieces and mortars made by the Soviet Union, as well as rifles and other military supplies, at the port of Cartagena; (3) On October 19, the Russian ship "Qiuxuqifu" unloaded 85 Russian-made military trucks and Russian-made tires at the port of Alicante. The accusation against Italy was that on October 1, three Italian planes flew down to the port of Palma in the Balearic Islands. Around that day, an Italian ship unloaded several boxes of military equipment and bullets in the port.</p>

<p>At the same time, Mr. Maisky, the Russian Ambassador to Britain, under the strong pressure of other members of the Non-Intervention Committee, has applied for the Soviet government to continue to clarify the letter that the country submitted on Friday, declaring its effective withdrawal from the committee's non-intervention agreement. It is heard that the committee has raised a special issue and wishes the Soviet Union to answer it clearly, that is, "Whether the Soviet Union will continue to regard itself as bound by the same conditions of the agreement as other participating countries in the agreement." Lord Plymouth, the chairman of the committee, declared yesterday at the meeting of the subcommittee that he did not understand the meaning of the letter presented by the Soviet Union. The Italian Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Grandi, then rose to speak, saying that the Soviet Union had determined that other countries had violated the non-intervention agreement without waiting for the committee to decide everything in accordance with the meeting procedures. Mr. Grandi refused to discuss the points in Russia's accusation against Italy, saying that he should first understand whether Mr. Maisky's presence still represented a government bound by the agreement, or was merely an observer. If Russia was only an observer, it would not be appropriate to allow it to attend the meeting. Thereupon, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Mr. Bismarck, and the French Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Corbin, both urged for clarification of the Russian letter. When the subcommittee began to consider increasing the strength of the non-intervention agreement, Mr. Maisky again proposed the Soviet Union's proposal to control Portuguese ports by the British and French naval fleets, but the meeting expressed the opinion that the Soviet Union's proposal was difficult to implement. Lord Plymouth informally proposed sending a delegation to various ports in Spain to investigate everything, but the public did not make a decision on this point.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Under Strict Security in Beijing: Left and Right Wing Demonstrations; Both Sides Shout Slogans Without Conflict; Leader of the Rexist Party Arrested <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Brussels: Today was the day the fascist Rexist Party held a demonstration. The party's leader, Degrelle, had just left his private residence in the Place Saint-Gudule, preparing to participate in the demonstration, when he was arrested by the police. Count de Terlowna, a senator of the party, was also arrested. Earlier, veterans of the Battle of the Yser in the European War marched in front of King Leopold III at 10:00 AM. No incidents occurred at that time. After the parade ended, many Rexist Party members flocked to the city center, shouting slogans such as "The Rexist Party will eventually win!" and giving each other the fascist salute. At the same time, the Socialist and Communist parties also held counter-demonstrations, also raising their fists to each other. Both sides shouted slogans, but no conflict occurred. Only a few thousand Rexist Party members participated in today's demonstration. When they passed the Place Saint-Gudule, Degrelle was about to deliver a speech from the balcony of his private residence, but unexpectedly, he was arrested shortly after. This morning, armed police patrolled the streets, and security at government offices was extremely tight. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Brussels: After the arrest of Rexist Party leader Degrelle and Senator Count de Terlowna, a large crowd gathered in the Place Saint-Gudule. Many party members also gathered in front of the stock exchange to protest. More than forty people were arrested, including Rexist Party member of parliament, Knaepen. The police dispersed the demonstrators. Before the police intervened, the crowd was generally calm, simply shouting slogans in response to each other, such as "The Rexist Party will win!" or "The Rexist Party is making another outcry!" After the police made arrests, the crowd became agitated. When veterans of the European War paraded in front of King Leopold III, most of the people expressed their loyalty to the royal family and shouted "Long live the King!" Rexist Party members remained silent, some giving the fascist salute and shouting slogans such as "The Rexist Party will win!" and "Long live Degrelle!" In addition, the Rexist Party headquarters was guarded by mounted police, and no trouble occurred. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Although the fascist Rexist Party was scheduled to hold a demonstration today, the general impression in Beijing last night was that tensions had eased. There were no crowded conditions at the train stations, and no large numbers of party members were seen arriving. Most of those who originally intended to demonstrate were discouraged by the government's strict surveillance. However, the people at the party headquarters were still very excited, and the leaders stayed at the headquarters day and night. They admitted that they had failed to achieve their goal of gathering 250,000 party members in Beijing. Newspaper boys were selling the Rexist Party's newspaper, "The True National Newspaper," throughout the city, along with the party's slogans and a letter to the people, advising them not to be seduced by those who intended to cause trouble. In addition, major roads in the suburbs of Beijing were guarded by military police, prohibiting the passage of vehicles. It seems that Rexist Party leader Degrelle's plan to gather party members and enter Beijing has been abandoned. Therefore, most people believe that no serious incidents will occur today, as the Rexist Party is not accustomed to violence. However, Degrelle still plans to hold gatherings in several places this afternoon, which may cause some occasional conflicts. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Both the left and right wings here are paying close attention to the tense situation between the Belgian government and the Fascist Party, because once the Rexist Party gains power, it will not only greatly affect French domestic affairs, but also change the international political situation in Europe.

<h3 id="e56">Portugal Severing Relations with Spain Causes Shock in Paris <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Portuguese government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish government has caused a deep shock in diplomatic circles here. France is maintaining extreme silence in order to prevent possible international repercussions, but it is generally expected that Germany, Italy and Portugal will soon recognize the National Army government in Burgos as the "legitimate" government of Spain. After recognition, the three countries will undoubtedly argue that no one can stop them from transporting arms to the legitimate government, while the Soviet Union and France still recognize the Madrid government as legitimate, and will therefore also be free to transport arms to it. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: After the Portuguese government severed diplomatic relations with the Spanish government yesterday, political figures did not find it surprising. It is expected that Foreign Minister Monteiro's note to Spanish Ambassador Albornoz will mention the Spanish government's interference in Portuguese domestic affairs, and will accuse the Spanish government of repeatedly broadcasting alarmist messages about the situation in Portugal, supporting leftist figures who have fled to Spanish territory, and violating current international regulations in many ways. Political figures in Portugal also said that most of the staff of the Spanish Embassy in Portugal have joined the National Army government, and the embassy has become virtually non-functional. Ever since the Madrid government's militiamen broke into the Portuguese Embassy in September to search for files, relations between Portugal and Spain have been tense. To protect the safety of the embassy, Spanish Ambassador Albornoz requested that the Portuguese government send police to guard it. Later, extremists in western Spain invaded the Portuguese border. The Portuguese government negotiated with both the Madrid government and the National Army government in Burgos, sending the letter to the Burgos government through its representative stationed in the capital of Portugal. At the time, the Portuguese government's adoption of this procedure implied recognition of the National Army government. In addition, the representative sent by the National Army government had already occupied the Spanish consulate here. From this it can be seen that the Portuguese government's desire to sever diplomatic relations with the Madrid government was not a sudden decision. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

In addition, Radek, the chief editor of Izvestia, the well-known journalist, Pyatakov, the Deputy Commissioner of Heavy Industry, and Rafalovsky, the chief editor of the Moscow Daily, had already been arrested. Rouzeaud, the correspondent for Le Petit Parisien, also said that the defendants would be tried after the Soviet Union's National Day celebration (November 7) and before the opening of the All-Union Congress of Soviets (November 25). The trial will be held in strict secrecy, but the verdict will be made public. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Police, while searching a tavern 75 miles northwest of Marseilles in Avignon, discovered a large organization that secretly transported arms to supply the Spanish government. A large number of German Mauser rifles, Swedish submachine guns, French pistols, and machine gun bullets were seized. The tavern was apparently an arms depot. The arms were collected by far-left groups in various parts of France and abroad, and then transported to Spain via Marseilles. This search was carried out by the judicial authorities after receiving anonymous letters. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fu-chu, upon being summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, traveled by special train from Ji'nan to Hangzhou on the 15th of this month to pay his respects, report on the political situation in the province, and make some requests. After completing his official business, he went to Beijing, where he also met with Chairman Lin Sen, and paid his respects to the central authorities. Subsequently, due to the need to handle important matters in the province, he and Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, left Beijing on a special train on the afternoon of the 23rd, heading north. At 4:00 AM on the 24th, the train passed Yanzhou, where he summoned officers above the rank of battalion commander of the garrisoned troops to give them instructions. Then, he boarded the train again and continued north. At 8:50 AM, he arrived in Ji'nan. The province had received a telegram in advance, and Provincial Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters Liu Shuxiang, Director of Civil Affairs Li Shuchun, Director of Finance Wang Xiangrong, Director of Construction Zhang Honglie, Director of Education He Sili, Mayor of Ji'nan Wen Chenglie, Division Commanders Sun Tongxuan, Zhan Shutang, Cao Fulin, and important figures from the Party, government, and military circles all came to the station to welcome him. In addition, Mayor of Qingdao Shen Honglie, responding to Han's telegram, rushed from Qingdao. Kong Decheng, the Sacrificial Official to Confucius, who happened to be in Ji'nan, also came to the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Han went to the provincial government for a brief rest. In the afternoon, he hosted a banquet at Longdong in the east of the city, entertaining Shen Honglie and Ge Guangting, and enjoying the autumn scenery. After Han returned to Ji'nan, the reporter visited him at the provincial government and inquired about the details of his meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his impressions of his southern tour. According to his account, "This trip, I went to both Beijing and Hangzhou, where I met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Vice-Chairman Feng Yuxiang, and the central leaders. I had not seen Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for more than two years, so of course there were many events to report. The Chairman is very concerned about the situation in Shandong. He did not ask about the quality of the county magistrates, but inquired about the level of public education. I immediately reported that our province has established three administrative districts to run rural agricultural schools and train the public. I also briefly reported on the political construction in the province, which was greatly appreciated. I am ashamed that I have not made any achievements, and I should work harder in the future. My impression of the southern tour is very good. Everywhere I went, not only the material construction was progressing rapidly, but everyone's spirit was united and private opinions were completely eliminated, which I greatly admired. Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Mr. Feng are all in very good health, both mentally and physically. Chiang paid special attention to the political construction and water conservancy projects in the province and will allocate funds to support and promote them as much as possible. As for the Sino-Japanese diplomatic issue, it is still quiet, and the stalemate has not been broken. Foreign Minister Zhang Qun and Kawagoe have met several times, but the results of the negotiations are not very satisfactory. Suma returned to Tokyo to request instructions on the orders of Kawagoe. Our government has a certain limit for independent Sino-Japanese negotiations. According to the current situation, it can be resolved through diplomatic channels. Military action between China and Japan may not occur. All issues in the province will be carried out in accordance with the central government's intentions. I am optimistic about Shandong and also optimistic about the future of the country. Many of the rumors circulating are just that. After returning to Ji'nan, I will not be going anywhere else for the time being. In addition to the four newly established administrative districts, there are no other New Year plans for political improvement in the province," etc. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Grain Prices Soar Uncontrollably in Northern Anhui, Breaking All Previous Records; Authorities Seek to Stabilize Market Prices <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In northern Anhui, after years of floods and droughts, the rural economy has declined drastically, and low grain prices have hurt farmers, creating a widespread phenomenon. Unexpectedly, in recent months, grain prices have soared step by step, which is the opposite of the situation in previous years. Most of the poor farmers have suffered greatly. The grain markets in various counties do not reduce the soaring high prices due to the autumn harvest. Taking Bengbu city as an example, the recent market price of wheat has risen to $18.40 per stone, soybeans to $14.40 per stone, sesame to $19.50 per stone, rice to $18.80 per stone, sorghum to $10.40 per stone. The supply of miscellaneous grains is scarce, and the price has skyrocketed, breaking all previous records and reaching the peak. The reasons for this are nothing more than three: 1. There has been no rain for more than a month, and the weather is very dry, making it difficult to sow winter wheat. Droughts have become a disaster in various counties, and farmers are worried that there will be a famine year, so they hoard new grains and are reluctant to sell them quickly. The market is short of grain, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. 2. The situation is uncertain and the people are frightened. The farmers in northern Anhui have little knowledge and do not understand the circulating legal tender at all. They are suspicious and worry that it would be better to hoard grain than to sell it, regardless of market demand. 3. In North China, people from a certain country secretly instructed unscrupulous merchants to purchase huge amounts of grain and transport it for export. Unscrupulous merchants only care about profits and disregard the people's food, so they try their best to manipulate the market. The grain in Jiangsu and Anhui is also being absorbed. Due to these three reasons, grain prices in northern Anhui have reached the highest record. The price of flour, which is needed by the citizens for daily use, has also increased with the price of grain, rising from $3.20 per bag to $4.10 per bag. Amid the people's worries, there is still a tendency for prices to rise. The local authorities here believe that if grain prices continue to soar, the people's food will be at risk. Recently, they invited officials and gentry to a meeting at the Public Security Bureau to discuss ways to stabilize grain prices. It was resolved that the two chiefs of the Water and Land Public Security Bureaus, Lu and Jiang, would contact the persons in charge of the two flour mills, Xinfengbao and Yu, to restrict the price of flour from rising again while the price of wheat has not risen. As for stabilizing grain prices, the Chamber of Commerce will convene all industries to discuss relief measures to maintain the people's food. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Negotiations on Municipal Debt with Japanese Nationals in Xiamen; Japanese Consul First Proposed $370,000; Audited Amount is Over $260,000; Second Proposal Mostly Has No Record <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the reconstruction of the urban area in Xiamen in 1925, opening up roads, filling land, and building dikes, the work was mainly handled by the Municipal Council, the Road Administration Office, and the Dike Construction Office. During this period, private land and houses were acquired at estimated values. The work concluded in 1934. At that time, due to the drastic drop in land prices, no one bid on the official land, and some of the debts remained unpaid, some of which were owed to foreign nationals, with the majority being Japanese. On May 17 of this year, the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen sent a letter to the municipal government, proposing an unpaid debt of more than 270,000 yuan for the acquisition of houses and land belonging to Japanese nationals by the former Road Administration Office, requesting payment. The municipal government believed that this debt was not limited to foreign nationals, and that many Chinese people were also owed money, so it decided to reorganize the entire situation. The Road Administration Debt Reorganization Committee was jointly formed by the municipal government and various sectors in July to begin the reorganization. The debt proposed by the Japanese consul was also submitted for review. Unexpectedly, on the 13th of this month, the Japanese consul sent another letter to the municipal government, for the second time proposing the unresolved debts of Japanese nationals, stating that "Regarding the 21 Japanese nationals, including Li Yongfu, who were owed more than 370,000 silver dollars by the former Road Administration Office, this consulate sent a letter on May 17 of this year for your reference and action. It is now heard that your government has organized a Debt Reorganization Committee and has concrete measures for repaying old debts. However, there are still many lands and houses owned by Japanese nationals that were acquired or demolished by the Chinese authorities at that time that have not yet been resolved. A list is enclosed for your reference, and it is planned to send personnel to negotiate and gradually resolve the matter." The total amount listed was 987,400 yuan. After the municipal government handed over the debt list to the Bureau of Public Works, item-by-item verification and signing was carried out, revealing that most of it had no record to check, and the remaining parts were improperly authorized or not recognized by the Chinese side according to law. The bureau sent it to the Debt Reorganization Committee for review. The committee held a regular meeting on the 20th and clearly verified the debt proposed by the Japanese consul for the first time. The number of debts owed to Japanese nationals was calculated as follows: purchase fees for which payment vouchers had been issued but not paid were 71,002 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, 9 li; purchase fees for which contracts had not been paid and payment vouchers had not been issued were 15,647 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen; loans and refunds of land prices were 173,987 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen, totaling 260,637 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 fen, 9 li. In addition, 31,515 yuan, 4 jiao, 4 fen, could not be listed as debt. The interest on the above-listed loans and refunds of land prices will not be listed for the time being and will be discussed again during the debt settlement. Detailed lists are available for all of the above items. This is the debt proposed by the Japanese consul for the first time that has been verified, recorded, and recognized for settlement. Regarding the 987,400 yuan proposed for the second time, the Debt Reorganization Committee decided that "The list of unresolved debts of Japanese nationals sent by the Japanese consul will be submitted to the Municipal Government through the Bureau of Public Works after detailed review. It is still under review. Most of the debts proposed by the Japanese consul for the second time involve official properties and public lands that Japanese nationals claim to own. At that time, the Road Administration Office ordered them to submit property deeds, but they could not submit them, so their ownership was revoked. A portion of the debt involved compensation for the loss of cemeteries ceded for roads. There are also beaches that have been filled into embankments by the Dike Construction Office, but Japanese nationals claim to own the property and demand compensation for the land price. The Japanese side does not dare to claim that all of the debts registered for the second time are based on factual evidence, so they requested that personnel be sent to consult with the Debt Reorganization Committee to verify and resolve each item. The future resolution of this "no record to check" debt will require considerable negotiation. (October 23)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Recent Conditions in Guangdong and Guangxi (10): The Distinguished Guests of the Lequn Society <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Xiao'an</p>
<p>The establishment of the Lequn Society is mainly for Party, military, and government agencies, and is used to entertain guests. In recent years, Guangxi has been working hard on construction, and many people have come from afar to Guangxi to visit. At the same time, the Guangxi authorities have also hired scholars and experts from all fields to give lectures or guide the direction of construction. The Party, military, and government authorities have all entertained those who came to Guizhou. If they were to live in various hotels, it would be inconvenient. Therefore, the Lequn Society was organized, and the society was responsible for entertaining guests. Therefore, the interior of the society is quiet and similar to a YMCA, and it is also landscaped. It is said that the site of the society was once the private residence of Lu Rongting. After Lu's defeat, it became public property. Today, Lu's son, Yu Guang, still lives across the street from the society. The scope of the society is very large. Entering the gate is a garden, and cars can directly enter the garden. The western-style building in the center is the Lequn Hall. The reception and lodging departments are on the upper floor. The red railing at the top of the building, illuminated by electric lights at night, is vaguely visible under the green willows and white poplars, making it extremely elegant and lovely. Downstairs, there is a library, billiards room, western restaurant, and Chinese restaurant. Behind the Lequn Hall is a square, with lush green bamboo that is taller than the eaves. Every morning and evening, one can watch the fallen leaves flutter, and the feeling is distant and peaceful. The rear seat is a three-story western-style building, named Youth Building, which is divided into the office of the Director-General, a conference hall, a board of directors room, an entertainment department, a cultural department, a chess room, a gymnasium, and a friendship hall. To the left of Lequn Hall and the Youth Building is Le Yuan. There is a lake in the garden, with a lake center pavilion in the middle. There are nine-turn bridges in the front and back that can be used to pass through. The four weeks of the garden are planted with exotic flowers and herbs. Outside the lake, there is a green lawn, a music pavilion, and a tennis court. The area of the court is quite large, and the layout is very complete. It is much better to use this as a place to entertain guests than ordinary hotels, and guards are placed in front of the door. High-ranking officials often come to the society to play and feast with guests, which is especially safe. Therefore, the people of Guizhou call it a guesthouse, not a hostel. There are twenty-four rooms in the society. The cheapest room rent is one dollar per day, and the most expensive is twelve dollars. However, there are those who are discussed on a weekly basis and those who are discussed on a monthly basis. Members are calculated at a 20% discount. Therefore, even if they are not people who are entertained by the Party, military, and government authorities, they can also live in the society. The society is open at any time to accept tourists who travel to Nanning, unless it is during a period when it is ordered to entertain guests.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Nanning, it happened to be the beginning of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters' order to carry out demobilization. The Headquarters had just summoned the military and division commanders of each army, as well as the commanders of the militia regiments, to discuss the demobilization plan and training plan. The military and division commanders of each army and the commanders of the militia regiments in all parts of the province arrived in Nanning one after another. Among them, many people, such as Liu Shiyi, Qin Lianfang, Wang Zanbin, and Qu Shounian, stayed at the Lequn Society. For a time, the society was full of cars and horses, and distinguished guests were very frequent. The reporter went to the society from the airport. The person in charge of the society initially told me that it was full, which shows the grandeur of the situation. Later, the person in charge inquired with the hostel department and learned that Qu Shounian had returned to Yonglin earlier in the morning, so they used the room where Qu had lived to accommodate the reporter. At that time, the people who were living in the society also included Central Committee Member Liu Luyin and Mr. Wang Zhisheng. There were also several students who had studied abroad studying the army and aircraft and had graduated and returned to Guizhou to serve, and who were also living in the society. The reporter and Mr. Wang Zhisheng had originally parted in Shanghai. Because I was eager to meet him, I learned that Mr. Wang had also come for sightseeing. Meeting in a foreign land, we shook hands with great joy. And because Mr. Wang had arrived before me, I took him as a guide and begged him to guide me in everything. In the course of our idle conversation, I learned that Liu Luyin had gone to Liuzhou and Guilin for sightseeing and had not returned. Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai had joined forces and went to Haiphong, one to Hong Kong and one to Beihai. And I gave him a summary of the situation in Guizhou, the progress of the demobilization, the training of the militia, and the state of society. Then we had lunch together. After lunch, at about 1:00 PM, I went to visit Li Zongren at the Fourth Army Group Headquarters with Mr. Wang. Because although Li is the highest military officer in Guizhou Province, he has no bad habits of bureaucracy, and is willing to meet with guests at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Anhui Province Drought Panic: Grain Prices Soar, Plague Rampant, Inland River Launches Suspend Navigation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Anhui Province originally relied heavily on agricultural products. This year, after the autumn harvest, for nearly two months, the sky has been clear for thousands of miles, with no rain. The fields are scorched, and everything is withered. It's difficult for wheat seeds to enter the soil, and the growth of beans and vegetables is difficult. Drought conditions have already appeared in various places, and the serious signs of spring famine have greatly threatened the entire population. The soaring grain prices are an abnormal phenomenon that hasn't been seen in many years. Although foreign merchants are actively purchasing, the sources are scarce. The fact that the prolonged drought will cause a spring famine has a greater impact. Various firms, including Yanjin and Guangdong-Chaozhou, have been vying to purchase grain in Wuhu in recent days, especially the Yanjin firms, which have spread rumors about the puppet Manchukuo purchasing and hoarding grain, which has further caused panic about food. In Lujiang, which produces the most rice, ordinary indica rice has surged to eight yuan and three jiao per shi. Superior quality rice also sells for eight yuan, one jiao, and two fen. Superior quality machine-milled rice in Nanling has even reached eight yuan, seven jiao, and eight fen. Other counties, such as Chaoxian, Qingyang, Wuwei, and Tongcheng, have also reached more than eight yuan. The market prices of miscellaneous grains such as wheat, beans, and sesame have all exceeded the records of recent years. Every day, as much as 10,000 to 20,000 bags of rice are gathered in Wuhu for export. Therefore, the rising prices are unknown. The rising prices are unknown and the extent is also unknown. Moreover, in these two months, not only has there been no rain, but the river tides have also fallen sharply. There is no mountain flood flowing down the inland rivers, and no river flow irrigating them. They are almost dry and the bottoms can be seen. Therefore, the small boats from Wuhu to Nanling, Dongba, Xuancheng, Langxi, and other places have all had their construction blocked and have suspended navigation. The result of the dry sky and dry land is an extremely arid climate. Dust fills the air, suffocating people and endangering the mosquitoes and flies, which are taking advantage of the situation to extend their lives and are active everywhere. As a result, plagues are rampant. Malignant malaria, dysentery, and throat and eye diseases are spreading rapidly. According to recent reliable statistics, more than 2,000 people have died from seasonal diseases in various counties. Patients from the countryside are constantly being carried into the city for medical treatment. Although the Central Health Administration has sent personnel with medicines to various places for assistance, the region is vast, and the rescue personnel are coming and going in a hurry, with little effect. The Lunar Double Ninth Festival has passed, and the sky is still clear for thousands of miles. It seems that there is no hope for widespread rain in the near future. The future of people's food and the fierce flames of the plague are truly worrying. (24th)</p>

<p>Public prostitution in Suzhou has been open for a year. Due to the current situation, the business of public prostitutes at all levels is not thriving. Most of the first-class prostitutes have returned to other cities to work. Second and third-class prostitutes can barely maintain their business. The Prostitute Inspection Office of the Public Security Bureau has found that most of the second-class prostitutes are infected with diseases. Therefore, on the 25th, it was announced that the licenses of thirty-three second-class prostitutes and fifteen third-class prostitutes would be revoked, and they would not be allowed to receive customers. However, in recent days, private prostitutes have filled the inns inside and outside the city, and the authorities have strictly prohibited them.</p>

<p>At around 2 p.m. on the 24th, a strange warship suddenly appeared about two kilometers off Hupukou. The flags were unclear. After residents reported it, the Yuxun warship stationed in Hupuzhen observed it with a telescope. The warship had no flags, but it had anti-aircraft guns and wireless radio equipment. It also used small boats to patrol nearby. Its actions seemed to be measuring the water level. It left at around 5 p.m. The commander of the Zhenxun warship immediately reported to the county government by telephone. According to the observation of the villagers, there were symbols similar to Chinese phonetic alphabet characters on the stern of the warship, and it was undoubtedly a warship from a certain country.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Wuxi: Dispute over Loading and Unloading at Warehouses <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the transportation of goods, Shenxin Third Factory in this city specifically signed a cooperation agreement with the Lianglu Bureau to rent a place called Yangqi in the west of the city's train station to build a new Rentui warehouse. The project has been completed, and Ding Ruixian, a local resident, has been hired as the foreman to be responsible for all the loading and unloading matters of the factory. However, the Hubei gang of loading and unloading workers in the miscellaneous grain class of the train station, including Chen Renrui, Jin Decai, and Duan Tinghua, believed that the area was their business scope and opposed it as a group, demanding that they be responsible for the loading and unloading. Rong Desheng, the owner of the warehouse, believed that the warehouse was officially rented from the Road Bureau, and he should have the right to make his own decisions on all loading and unloading matters. Furthermore, the Fuxin warehouse in Shanghai and other warehouses have precedents to follow and are not bound by customs. Therefore, he rejected the unreasonable demands. Afterwards, the Hubei gang workers repeatedly stirred up trouble and instigated all the workers to sign a consultation agreement, stipulating four conditions: 1. They pledged to fight to the death for this matter. If a fight occurs, they will jointly be responsible for all litigation matters. 2. If they become disabled due to the fight, they will share 300 yuan in legal tender. 3. If they die in a fight, they will jointly contribute 600 yuan in legal tender. 4. Those who do not participate in the fight will be jointly driven out. Ding Ruixian discovered the consultation agreement and submitted it separately to the Public Security Bureau, the county government, and the Second District Commissioner's Office, requesting assistance and requesting prompt prohibition to avoid danger. Yesterday was the day the warehouse was scheduled to start work, and the workers were supposed to officially start work. However, about 200 Hubei gang workers went to cause trouble again,抢抢 (unable to translate), and seized the work. The police from the Sixth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau were dispatched to stop them, but it was ineffective. They had to let them do as they pleased. At the same time, the warehouse reported the situation to the county bureau, requesting action. The matter is currently under consideration, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>

The remaining five districts, one, two, eight, nine, and ten, will begin registration around the middle of the next month. After the local court of this city was ordered to stop real estate registration, it was all handled by the Land Administration Bureau.</p>

<p>The county government has reformed the collection system this time, setting up land registrars in various townships to be responsible for urging the payment of land tax. All former tax collectors and village scribes have been abolished, and the practice of drafting tax collection forms and going to the countryside to collect taxes has been stopped. Now, in order to eliminate abuses, the county government is deeply afraid that the dismissed tax collectors and village scribes will spread rumors and disrupt the situation in the countryside, and will fraudulently collect grain payments and extort fees in the name of the government. Yesterday, the county government specially ordered the township chiefs to pay attention to this at all times. If found, they should report to the police, arrest them, and send them to the county for legal action. In addition, in order to rectify land tax, the county government has ordered that foreign vegetable farmers who owe land tax should be required by the land registrars to have their tenants deduct rent to pay off the grain tax. Large households who owe land tax should also be handled in the same way.</p>

Considering the sorrowful feelings, the peak of the mountain and the riverside cannot be reached. How can great virtue reach this? Through the construction of extraordinary talent, the safety of the universe is straightened. The President is like Yan Zeng, and is truly a teacher for the whole country. It is hoped that the raging waves will be turned back, and the precarious building can be supported. The poor people are placed in a comfortable environment, and the dying sores are raised. He declares great justice for our party, and makes great harmony the basis. It is hoped that the mountains and rivers inside and outside will be unharmed. What's more, the dangers and obstacles have been fully tasted. How can we expect the inexhaustible poetry to exist, and the posthumous works to enjoy the eternal broom? From then on, there will be endless regrets and sorrows, and we will watch a game of chess in grief. Alas, the bright soul will not be worn away, the iron liver will not be cold, the old generation will be carved away, and the legacy is still new. The essence is one, the holy is the spirit, accumulating morality can be literature, and the universe admires the former. He wields a spear to defend the country and wishes that strong men will rise again in the world. Alas, alas, enjoy!"</p>

His talent and wisdom are outstanding, and his reputation has spread since he was a weak youth. His character is upright, and even his mentors and guardians are not as good as him. His achievements are outstanding, and they are inscribed on tripods and utensils. His knowledge is vast, and he combines Chinese and foreign into one. He distinguishes between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and speaks clearly and does not hesitate. Those secular so-called interests, gains and losses, praise and slander, misfortune and blessing, you disdained to avoid them. He was always calm and composed, and he took on the rugged road of the world, casting the principles as laws, and hoped to have an end from the beginning. How can we plan for the end of the war, and feel the red fox and black crow? From then on, he recuperated in Xiangjiang, until he changed his mind in Guangzhou. What caused you anxiety was that all the facilities did not conform to the President's legacy. When the entire Party did not forget the old veterans, and unanimously pushed the central hub, the people depended on it, and relied on this person to drive him. You returned from overseas, and the situation was the same. You felt that the square and the round were chiseled, and it was still inevitable to disagree. Nai Zhi Luofu, Douyun spit beads, his mouth did not stop chanting, and his hands did not stop writing, regretting the setting sun's wings, and scratching his head with hesitation. In your life, you have heard of the present, and your death has been passed on to future generations. It is enough to believe that my way is not alone, and when the bad news arrives, the apes cry and the cranes scream, the sea roars and the rocks call, the grass and trees contain tears, the fish and insects are wet, the friendly countries are shocked and grieved, and the mourners are full of roads. The whole country is in a panic, like a leaking boat meeting the wind and rain, and it is unbearable to cry and sob. What's more, in the past, we followed you, showed each other our hearts, and imprinted our dreams together. When Jiacheng is forever strong, we are ashamed to hold the hands of you. In the face of the wind, we cry for both public and private, and we miss you, the love and sincerity of our comrades, which cannot be seen again, and the national crisis is getting worse day by day, and it is dangerous to be scattered."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the correspondent of the New Life News Agency interviewed a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who had come to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and asked about the details of the recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. According to the official, no results have been achieved since Foreign Minister Zhang and the Japanese Ambassador met five times. The report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun that our country has accepted some of the demands put forward by the Japanese side is not accurate. Mr. Suma's return to his country this time is probably to report to and request instructions from his domestic authorities. We sincerely hope that the Japanese government authorities can consider it carefully. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe has agreed with Foreign Minister Zhang to continue the sixth meeting tomorrow (i.e. today) afternoon. The official (the senior official referring to himself) said that he had been away from Beijing for two days and did not know if it was true.</p>

Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, and other groups such as the mosques in this city and the Humanitarian Monthly Society will send representatives to the ship to welcome them. The group's planned itinerary is as follows: Shanghai to Hong Kong in two days, stop for one day, Hong Kong to Singapore in five days, stop for two days, and then change ships directly to Jeddah, passing through Penang, Colombo, and Aden, to land at the port of Jeddah. The journey from Jeddah to Mecca is all desert and requires riding camels, which takes about two days to reach Mecca. The entire journey takes 27 days.

<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Dasheng Cotton Mill No. 1, which suspended operations last year, has recently been preparing to resume operations due to the increase in purchasing power in China's rural areas and the skyrocketing sales of cotton yarn and cloth, resulting in a shortage of supply and a return to the golden age of the European War.

More than 40 managers, including those from Fuyuan, Zifeng, Fukang, Dade, Zhiyu, Tongrun, Tongyu, Zhentai, Huifeng, Gengyu, Qingcheng, Hongsheng, Shenyuan, Chengyu, Shunkang, Yuansheng, Cunde, Yida, Hengxun, etc., attended, including Pei Yunqing, Shao Yanshan, Liu Wuqiao, Qian Yuansheng, Xu Jingxiang, Zai Jiemei, Zhao Songyuan, Xi Jiming, Zhang Dafu, and others. Shao Yanshan presided over the meeting. After exchanging opinions on the ten-end-of-month long-term credit loan period, the discussion began, and it was decided that the "internal rate" would be 5.5 yuan. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Various Dealers Begin Settling Internal Accounts</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from money dealers yesterday that the internal rate refers to the interest rate on long-term credit deposits of money dealers with their shareholders or colleagues. For example, 5.5 yuan means that the interest for six months on every 1,000 yuan of national currency is 5.5 yuan, which is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 1.1%. Starting from today, all dealers will settle interest on long-term credit deposits of shareholders in accordance with the internal market rate. In addition, the total amount of long-term credit loans due at the end of October from 49 Shanghai remittance money dealers is approximately 70 million yuan. The total amount from Ningbo dealers is approximately 20 million yuan, and the total amount from Hankou and other places is approximately 10 million yuan. The total of the above is approximately 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Three Banks Handle Interbank Lending</p>
<p>In order to adjust interbank finance, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications previously organized a lending committee. The fund was guaranteed by the three banks in a 4:4:2 ratio. When colleagues needed it, they could apply to the three banks for borrowing with deeds, goods, etc. The interest rate was particularly low. In view of the approaching end of October this year, it was decided to handle interbank lending as in previous years. In addition, of the 18 million yuan that the money dealers borrowed from the three banks during the Dragon Boat Festival last year, 10 million yuan has not yet been repaid. This year, the dealers at the end of October do not need to borrow from the three banks again in fact because the market has become active.</p>
<h3 id="e86">He Huaide's Comfortable Flight Across the Pacific; The Future Progress of Aviation is Unlimited <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reported that Mr. He Huaide, General Manager and Editor-in-Chief of the New York World, arrived in Shanghai on Saturday afternoon on a trans-Pacific commercial plane. After getting off the plane, he told guests: "This flight was not as tense as you might imagine. Of all the trips from the United States to Shanghai, this was the fastest." He stated that on Monday, October 12, at 5:10 PM, he boarded a full-night sleeper plane in New York, crossed the United States, and landed in San Francisco at 11:00 AM the next morning. The Philippine Clipper flying boat departed from Alameda on Wednesday (October 14) afternoon and arrived in Honolulu at 7:00 AM the next morning. On Friday (October 16), it continued to advance to Manila and landed in the Philippines on Tuesday, October 20. It flew out of Manila on the 23rd and arrived in Macau and Hong Kong the next day. The residents of Macau welcomed it very much, while Hong Kong was not as enthusiastic as Macau. The merits of the Philippine Clipper cannot be exhausted in a few words. The decoration of the boat is very gorgeous, with three large rooms, one of which is a lounge for passengers to use. Sitting in it, one feels quite comfortable, so guests often gather here to play cards, dice, chat, or read books, according to their wishes. There is another room with four couches for guests who feel slightly tired from the fast trip. He only spent one night on the flying boat during the entire journey from Alameda to Honolulu and felt very comfortable. The two places are 2,400 miles apart, and it took 17 hours to complete the journey. Among the places stopped on the way from Honolulu to Manila, Guam is a giant island with excellent scenery, and Wake and Midway are both small islands. Looking down from an altitude of 10,000 feet, they seem even smaller. However, all the islands are equipped with new and beautiful hotels, with complete sanitary facilities and delicious meals, and fishing on the beach is especially enjoyable. Two years ago, Mr. He accompanied Mr. Clipper of Pan American Airlines on a trip to South America on the Brazilian Clipper. Since then, he has repeatedly discussed with Mr. Clipper the possibility of direct flights to China, but he never expected to be able to make this trip from New York. Mr. He said that the current Clipper is like comparing a rickshaw to a car compared to the original Clipper. The current one weighs 52,000 pounds and carries 24 passengers. A new flying boat weighing 82,000 pounds is currently under construction and will be able to carry 40 passengers. This flight is enough to prove the great progress of aviation, and the progress in the future is still limitless. He encountered various climates along the way, and even encountered storms, but being in the boat, he did not feel it. None of the guests experienced "airsickness," and the comfort was no less than that of a ship crossing the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Clipper also said that he was extremely satisfied with this trip. Pan American Airlines regards the Pacific business as the most important of all the routes operated by the company. This visit to China is to pay tribute to the company's representatives in China and various government officials. The cooperation given by the Chinese government is extremely grateful. Mr. Clipper will stay in China for a long time, and after visiting Nanjing and North China, he will return to the United States via Europe.</p>

Yesterday, it was decided again that starting from November 1, the shallow water fee for goods from Hankou to Changsha and Xiangtan would be increased by 75% based on the current water level.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Notice from the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry: Stamp the Ends of the Bolt of Fabric to Protect Legitimate Goods and Assist in Anti-Smuggling; The Deadline for Stamping is the End of this Month <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association issued a notice stating that in order to assist the government in anti-smuggling and protect the transportation and sale of legitimate goods, the association will conduct an appraisal of silk fabrics produced by members starting from October 1. The ends of the silk bolts will be stamped to identify them. The association has previously notified all member factories to comply with this. Now, the association will implement the appraisal procedure for both old and new goods produced by members. In addition to having the executive and supervisory committee members supervise the stamping of old goods, specialists will be assigned to various major refining factories to stamp the fabrics daily at a specified time in order to complete the process in the shortest possible time, so that domestically produced legitimate silk fabrics can have convenient transportation and sales opportunities. The association also convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 12th of this month and decided to stamp the products and notify members to comply quickly. Those who have not applied for appraisal must fill out the application form immediately and apply to the association. If the application procedure has been completed, but the refining factory that is undertaking the refining of the products does not have a stamping agent stationed by the association, the refining factory should be notified to send the refined goods to the association for stamping in the same amount every day. Do not neglect this, as it will hinder the transportation and sale of the products. The association has now stipulated that the stamping of both old and new goods must be completed by October 31 in accordance with the specified procedures. Starting from November 1, if any member's products are found to be unstamped, the association will no longer provide certification. If any problems arise in the future when unstamped silk fabrics are transported and sold to various parts of the country, the association will not be able to handle them. This has been unanimously approved and recorded. In addition to sending separate letters, this is also announced in the newspaper. It is hoped that all member factories will apply for appraisal and stamping before October 31. This is very important.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Bank of China Agrees to Handle Loan for Xiaofeng Agricultural Products; Personnel Have Been Sent to Investigate <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Zhejiang Construction Department stated that Xiaofeng County in the province is rich in products, but because there are no financial institutions with strong capital to regulate it, the economic turnover is stagnant and development is quite difficult. Although there are agricultural loan offices and cooperative societies in the county, the capital is only several thousand yuan, which is far from enough to handle agricultural mortgage loans. Therefore, the department sent personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai General Office of the Bank of China to invest and provide loans. It is reported that the Bank of China has accepted the suggestion of the Zhejiang Construction Department and has telegraphed the Hangzhou branch to send personnel to Xiaofeng County to investigate the organization of cooperative societies and the production situation. Once the investigators' report is returned, they will immediately go to the county to handle agricultural mortgage loans.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Torrent of Goods Heading Up the Yangtze River Creates Record High, Worth 30 to 40 Million Yuan This Month Alone <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since autumn this year, the volume of goods shipped from Shanghai along the Yangtze River has been unprecedented since 1935. The situation has become particularly congested since the first of this month. In just over twenty days, the goods shipped from Shanghai to various ports along the Yangtze River, based on October statistics, have filled approximately seventy ships traveling to the Yangtze (including the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze). Almost every one of these seventy Yangtze River boats was fully loaded when departing Shanghai, with ten out of ten compartments filled with cargo. As early as the 27th and 28th of last month, congestion was already apparent, but after the first of this month, Yangtze River merchants purchased goods in even greater quantities, loading them immediately upon acquisition, without any delay. Goods previously purchased and stored in Shanghai warehouses were also moved out at this time. The tonnage requirements of various merchant houses needing space on ships have exhausted the capacity of the six major shipping companies, leading to a situation of too many goods and too few ships, resulting in a severe shortage of tonnage, an unprecedented situation for Yangtze River shipping since 1935. The business revenue and freight volume of the six companies are also increasing daily. Company executives are visibly pleased. According to investigations, in just over twenty days, goods worth at least 30 million yuan have been shipped from Shanghai to the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan, exceeding one million dan (a unit of weight) in total. A large quantity of goods still awaits shipment in Shanghai warehouses, including 200,000 bags of white sugar alone, which cannot be shipped due to lack of tonnage. Additionally, over 10,000 tons of timber are urgently awaiting shipment. Cotton yarn, driven by rising prices, has already been prioritized for export. Current surveys indicate that Shanghai is experiencing a shortage of cotton yarn. Piece goods are still being loaded, and the demand for hardware products shipped upstream is also very high. The reporter, seeking to understand why Yangtze River exports this year (especially this month) are so congested, conducted a special investigation. According to Yangtze River merchants, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan have all experienced bumper harvests this year, resulting in strong purchasing power among the people, so the demand for daily necessities has increased several times compared to previous years. The large-scale purchases and transportation of sugar, seafood, hardware, foreign cloth, cotton yarn, timber, etc., to the Yangtze River are partly for stockpiling and partly for construction purposes. This is a special circumstance. Some are even building new houses in the upper Yangtze region specifically for use as storage warehouses. Furthermore, many new shops have recently opened in Changsha, Hankou, and Shashi due to the economic recovery of farmers. Another reason is that the Yangtze River water level has receded earlier this year. Currently, the lowest point in the upper reaches still has seventeen feet of water, while the lowest point in the lower reaches only has fourteen to fifteen feet. If it does not rain for a long time, the outflow from the upper Yangtze will decrease, and there is concern that the Yangtze River will dry up completely during the winter dry season. Therefore, shipping companies are raising water level fees early, and merchants are also stocking up on winter goods early to prevent difficulties navigating during the dry season. This is also a major factor contributing to the booming business.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Raw Silk Sales Improve, September Exports Reach 1,500 Bales, Further Increases Expected <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, raw silk sales have recently improved. The reporter's inquiries with silk industry sources indicate that the reasons for the improved exports are: the ongoing Spanish Civil War and a clear international backdrop signaling that a second World War is imminent. Although the devaluation of the French franc is unfavorable for trade with the Gold Bloc countries, the need for European and American countries to stockpile raw materials for wartime purposes has led to large-scale purchases by France, the United States, Britain, and Germany. Moreover, the impact of the devaluation and financial crisis that has happened to countries that used to be a part of the Gold Bloc on the international market, specifically the Japanese export to France, Switzerland, and Italy, is greater than it is for China, so the devaluation of the French franc will only raise the price of Chinese silk. Sales will not suffer a great blow. It is reported that raw silk exports in September reached approximately 1,500 bales, double the 700 bales in August. The situation has improved further this month. It is expected that raw silk exports will increase further amidst the turmoil in Europe.</p>

<p>According to the Ta Kung News Agency, after the political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces was stabilized, the central and local financial authorities have made great efforts to reorganize the financial sector. Currency unification has now been completed. Following the establishment of a branch of the Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Committee in Guangzhou, the Central Bank has previously shipped large quantities of legal tender to Guangdong for use. Currently, due to the strong demand for legal tender and subsidiary coins in the two provinces, a large amount of legal tender from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, as well as newly minted subsidiary coins from the Central Mint, have been shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong and Guangxi for circulation in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Seamen's Union Warns Shipmates to Pay Attention to Six Points <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union has always been serious about implementing the New Life Movement among shipmates. It has now issued a circular warning shipmates not to smoke opium, carry contraband, bring illegal items, insult passengers, or extort tips. The text of the circular is as follows: "Smoking opium and carrying contraband are strictly prohibited by law. The union has repeatedly issued orders to strictly prohibit these actions. Since the issuance of these orders, many have complied, but a few who disregard the law continue to engage in these activities secretly. Recently, some shipmates in the middle class have been disrespectful to passengers during work hours, even extorting tips and disobeying the captain's orders. Such behavior damages the reputation of our seamen and must be strictly prohibited. Here are the points to pay attention to: (1) Do not smoke opium or other drugs. (2) Do not carry contraband or illegal items. (3) Do not insult passengers or extort tips. (4) Do not disobey the orders of the captain or purser. (5) If a ship incident occurs, make every effort to rescue others. (6) Do not violate the union's regulations. Any member of the union who violates any of the above rules after the issuance of this circular will be severely punished without leniency. All are to comply with this order."</p>

<h3 id="e104">To Avoid Japanese Misunderstandings, Police Use Written Language Instead of Speech, Using Japanese Slips of Paper to Communicate with Japanese in Cases of Language Barriers <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to the French newspaper translated by the Foreign News Agency, since the Japanese sailor incident on Hai'ning Road, disputes have frequently occurred between Japanese residents and Chinese citizens in this city. The Public Security Bureau believes that a major cause of these incidents is language barriers. As a result of research, a preventive measure has been developed: using a small printed slip of paper to replace speech, to avoid misunderstandings. Starting from the 25th, police officers at the North Station branch and other locations have been equipped with these printed slips of paper, containing the following eight items: 1. Where are you going? Please write it down and show me. 2. Please do not go to that remote area. 3. I am now escorting you to the police station to talk with someone who understands Japanese. 4. Do you have a business card? Please give me one. 5. Please wait here for a moment while I get someone who understands Japanese to come. 6. I am calling someone who understands Japanese to talk with you. 7. Please tell me your nationality, name, and address. 8. Your actions may cause misunderstandings among the people. I am taking you to the police station to talk with someone who understands Japanese. These printed slips of paper are in Japanese on one side and Chinese on the other. If an incident occurs and there is a language barrier, the police can immediately show the Japanese person the Japanese slip of paper, asking them to go to the police station or asking where they are going.</p>

<p>Taihe Drought Disaster: The United Southeast China General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a report yesterday from the Taihe branch in Anhui Province on the severe drought conditions and the urgent need for relief. Letters have been sent to various branches to appeal for assistance. The original letter is reproduced below: (Omitted Titles) "Taihe is a land of poor soil and impoverished people. In years of good harvest, the yields are barely sufficient. In years of crop failure, starvation is inevitable. Last year's autumn drought was disastrous, with no harvest of soybeans, buckwheat, or mung beans. The cries of hunger are everywhere, a scene too terrible to witness. Our society and other charitable organizations raised funds for relief, which, while not without some benefit, was merely a drop in the bucket. A second appeal for spring relief went unanswered. When the winter wheat was about to ripen, the refugees gradually returned. However, since the latter part of May and throughout June and July, not a drop of rain has fallen. Seven or eight out of ten fields of soybeans, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains have not been planted. Those that have been planted have been scorched and withered, even worse than last autumn. The days ahead are long and hopeless. Thousands of families are fleeing to other places, taking the old and supporting the young. What will become of them when the severe winter arrives? Therefore, we publicly implore you to show your divine benevolence and urgently allocate relief funds to provide assistance. The disaster victims of the entire county will be eternally grateful and will never forget your kindness. We weep with tears and await your urgent response."</p>
<p>Shaanxi Bandit Disaster: Northern Shaanxi has been occupied by bandits for years. After repeated campaigns by the National Army, the area has been gradually pacified. The affected people in the recovered areas are unable to survive. The Executive Yuan has now allocated 300,000 yuan and dispatched He Shaonan, a member of the Relief Committee, to lead relief workers with funds to provide assistance. The Relief Committee has received a letter from Qiu Xiang, the relief commissioner of Luochuan, from Suide, describing the disaster conditions. The letter is reproduced below: "To your excellency, I sent an airmail letter from Xi'an, hoping you have seen it. I followed Commissioner He with seven relief workers, borrowing Deputy Commander Zhang's plane to fly to Suide. I have had brief conversations with Commander Tang and Division Commander Gao, and learned about the situation in northern Shaanxi. Except for Luochuan and five or six other counties where transportation is relatively convenient, the rest face great transportation difficulties. Food is completely lacking. Yanchuan County was recently recovered. There are only about one hundred households in the city. In the countryside, there are two villages, each with about three or four hundred households, totaling only about a thousand households. The situation in the villages near the bandit areas and the newly recovered cities is roughly the same. Counties not affected by bandits have a very large population, such as Suide County, which has more than 120,000 people. The current relief funds cannot be allocated without on-site surveys. Li Yuhai and Xi Chaofan have been sent to the first and second relief districts to conduct surveys. The fifth district is completely inaccessible. Since the bandit disasters, people in all counties have gathered together. One can travel for dozens of miles before seeing a village. Livestock has also decreased. The daily price of a donkey is at least one or two yuan. Relief workers have no choice but to walk. We will do our best to live up to your expectations. The survey personnel in the first and second relief districts will not be able to reach Suide until ten days later. The survey will begin in half a month. I will report on the progress later. Qiu Xiang, October 12."</p>

<p>From April to June of this year, when smuggling was rampant, a Russian named Pipuvukneitz took advantage of the situation. Impersonating a senior customs official, he falsely claimed to merchants selling smuggled goods that he could help them avoid paying taxes, but they had to provide a substantial reward. Many were deceived. A Korean named Shi Jiong-bai (also known as Haikou) had a large quantity of rayon transported to China. Pipu used crafty words to trick Shi, and they signed a contract promising Pipu a reward of over ten thousand yuan. However, Shi's rayon was seized by customs, and he had to pay taxes to avoid confiscation of the goods. Shi reported the incident to the police, who arrested Pipu and handed him over to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. This was reported in this newspaper. Now, a Zhejiang native named Tan Wenhu (also known as Min) is also suspected of being heavily involved in the case. The police requested the First Special Court to detain him. At 10:30 PM on the day before yesterday, detectives arrested Bao Jun, a native of Shaoxing, at Tan's home at No. 3, Lane 402, North Zhejiang Road. He was sent to the Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that Bao also had a significant connection to Pipu's case and was detained for further investigation, and to be questioned together with Pipu. Judge Ye Shengchao approved the detention and joint questioning.</p>

<p>Launching a fund-raising association. The inspection of grain reserves in Ningbo's affiliated counties has been completed. The Datong News Agency reports that Yu Qiaqing and others have launched the Ningbo-affiliated County Grain Purchasing Association. Since its establishment on the 13th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, the association has successfully negotiated with Hangzhou and has scheduled a second meeting of initiators at the beginning of the month to collect funds and begin purchasing grain. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fund-raising Association</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Jin Tingsun, and others initiated the establishment of the Ningbo-affiliated County Grain Purchasing Association, it was decided to purchase 1.5 million yuan worth of grain. Negotiations with the Zhejiang Agricultural Bank and the Zhejiang Provincial Government have been successfully completed, with a 70% mortgage (1.05 million yuan). The remaining 450,000 yuan will be covered by a 2/3 credit loan (300,000 yuan) and a 1/3 cash loan (150,000 yuan), with the association and the Zhejiang Provincial Government each bearing half of the amount. With the successful completion of the above negotiations, funds need to be collected urgently to purchase grain. Therefore, the association has scheduled a second meeting of initiators at the beginning of the month to discuss further progress.</p>
<p>Surveying Stored Grain</p>
<p>Furthermore, to understand the current grain reserves in Ningbo-affiliated counties, the association sent commissioners to Ningbo for investigation. The investigation has now been completed, and the commissioners have returned to Shanghai to report. According to their investigation, as of the first ten days of the month, rice merchants in Ningbo had 66,451 shi of rice in storage and 2,860,200 jin of grain in storage, equivalent to 14,301 shi of rice. The increase in rice in the first ten days of the month was 41,061 shi, and the increase in grain was 3,338,800 jin, equivalent to 16,694 shi of rice. The sales of rice in the current ten days of the month were 19,578 shi, and the sales of grain were 1,370,600 jin, equivalent to 6,853 shi of rice. The current storage of rice is 87,934 shi, and the storage of grain is 483 shi (including 5,077 shi of rice from Shanghai, 15,038 shi of rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou, 234 shi of wheat from Wenzhou and Taizhou, and 500 shi of rice from Xiangshan).</p>

<p>Shen Xuechun, a 43-year-old teacher at Qingxin Middle School on Lujiabang Road outside the Great South Gate in Shanghai, earned a monthly salary of 100 yuan. His wife, Gong, 38, lived in Tangmuqiao in the countryside of Chuansha, Pudong. She was a pediatrician, earned a good income, and lived comfortably. However, they had no children after their marriage. Shen had taken a concubine, Xu (named Xinbao), from Xujiahui, Shanghai, who gave birth to one son and two daughters. The son had died young. The eldest daughter, Minfen, was 12, and the younger daughter, Minfang, was 10. Due to disagreements, Shen separated from the concubine and paid her 10 yuan per month. He took back the two daughters and sent them to the countryside to be raised by his wife. Shen then took a Suzhou prostitute, Yin, 35, as his concubine in Shanghai. They had lived together for eleven years, renting a house in the Yuxingfang on Shenfu Road in the French Concession. Shen and Yin were both addicted to opium. His monthly salary was used to pay his wife a monthly allowance of 20 yuan, his former concubine 10 yuan, and a 10 yuan club fee. Only 60 yuan remained for living expenses, leading to financial difficulties. As a result, Shen suffered from liver and stomach disease, which flared up intermittently. On the 19th of this month, Shen's liver and stomach disease relapsed. He took leave from work and stayed at home to seek medical treatment, but it was ineffective. He died on the morning of the 22nd. His concubine, Yin, sent someone to the countryside to inform his wife to come to Shanghai to handle the funeral. Shen's wife, Gong, did not arrive in Shanghai until the morning of the 23rd with relatives, without bringing any expenses. The deceased's concubine, Gu, had already prepared clothing and a coffin. When the wife arrived, the undertaker prepared to dress the deceased for the coffin. However, Shen's wife, Gong, discovered blue and purple spots on the deceased's body, suspecting that they were bruises from being beaten by the concubine. She started a quarrel, accusing the concubine Gu, but the matter could not be resolved. Therefore, Gong insisted that her husband had died from injuries inflicted by the concubine and reported the matter to the French police that afternoon, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan branch hospital for an autopsy. The next day, the Second Special Court was requested to send prosecutor Wang Ren, forensic doctors, and clerks to the hospital to verify that Shen Xuechun had died from illness. Since he had been dead for three days, the blood had stagnated in the corpse, causing the blue and purple spots. There was no other cause. After the officials questioned the deceased's wife and concubine, they ordered that the body be claimed by the deceased's wife, Shen Gong, after she signed a guarantee. After the autopsy, the family followed religious customs to collect the body and transport it back to the countryside for burial. The case of the wife and concubine quarreling over the cause of the husband's death, suspected to be due to injuries, was dismissed after the facts became clear.</p>

<p>Since autumn, this city has experienced little rainfall, causing farmers in the Shanghai suburbs to eagerly await rain. Although there was heavy fog yesterday morning, the weather also turned overcast, creating a sense of rain. Unfortunately, the fog soon dissipated and the sun shone brightly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fog Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The weather this autumn has been mostly sunny with little rain, gradually leading to drought conditions. Farmers are eagerly awaiting rain. The dry weather also makes it difficult to regulate one's health. Infectious diseases such as diphtheria are quite rampant. At dawn yesterday, heavy fog suddenly arose, and the sky also turned overcast, creating a strong sense of rain. However, after 8:00 AM, the fog dissipated and the sun shone brightly.</p>
<p>High Tide Expected</p>
<p>Although the sun reappeared after the fog dissipated, the weather was very humid. The ground in shady areas was slightly slippery. Therefore, it is generally speculated that there may be heavy rain within the day. According to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's predictions, due to the moon's proximity to the earth, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River on the 30th of this month. The tide will occur at the hour of zi (11:00 PM) on the 30th (estimated to be 11 feet 3 inches) and at the hour of wu (11:00 AM) (estimated to be 11 feet 8 inches), leaving only a little over a foot of clearance from the Bund embankment.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The River Level Continues to Drop, Making Navigation Difficult Between Shanghai and Hankou; The Reason for the Sudden Decrease is Scant Rainfall; Customs Has Set Up Draft Restriction Signs <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, since the water level of the Yangtze River drastically dropped, navigation for ships in the middle reaches from Hankou to Changsha has become difficult. Shipping companies have already begun to charge extra for shallow water. As for the lower reaches between Shanghai and Hankou, because the river level is still gradually decreasing, navigation will also gradually become more challenging. This is indeed something that deserves great attention. Now, we will explore the details of the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Last Year's Simultaneous Water Level Shows a Significant Disparity</p>
<p>A reporter specially visited Mr. Chen Renzheng, the chief of general affairs at the Ning Shao Shipping Company, to inquire whether the current decline in river levels would cause difficulties for shipping between Shanghai and Hankou in the lower reaches. According to Mr. Chen, the recent drastic drop in the Yangtze River's water level to just over ten feet is a rare occurrence in recent decades. Even at this time last year, the water level was still between thirty-six and thirty-seven feet. Compared with this year, the sudden drop of twenty feet can be described as an anomaly.</p>
<p>Continuous Decline Requires Reducing Draft</p>
<p>Mr. Chen continued, the Ning Jing vessel of the company recently came to Shanghai from Hankou. When passing through the Prince Reef, where the water is shallowest, it was personally measured and the water level was only seventeen feet. However, ships sailing between Shanghai and Hankou, carrying passengers and cargo, have a maximum draft of about twelve or thirteen feet, so there is currently no impact. If the river level continues to decline, dropping to around ten feet, it is possible to reduce the passenger and cargo load to lighten the ship's draft and adapt to the water level.</p>
<p>Reason for the Sudden Decrease: Scant Rainfall</p>
<p>Mr. Chen continued to say, since the current lowest water level is still sixteen or seventeen feet, there are no immediate difficulties for navigation in the lower reaches. However, special caution should be exercised. If a ship runs aground, it can impede the navigation of other vessels. Therefore, pilots must be particularly careful during this shallow water period. Regarding the earlier arrival of the Yangtze River's shallow water season this year, Mr. Chen said it is due to the recent lack of rainfall in the Yangtze River basin, which has caused the river to dry up. He hopes for abundant rainfall soon, which would not only benefit shipping on the Yangtze River, but also provide sufficient water for the fields.</p>
<p>Customs Sets Up Draft Restriction Signs</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs River Patrol Office, to provide guidance for upstream vessels during the shallow water season, has set up draft restriction signs in Wuhu, indicating the water level readings along the route above Wuhu. This allows all vessels going from Shanghai to Hankou to have something to follow. These draft signs are also equipped with lights, so they are clearly visible even at night. It is also understood that the draft of all river vessels must be lower than the water level by six inches to ensure safety.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Verdict in the Embezzlement Case of the Shanghai Branch Manager of Yumin Bank; Wu Sentenced to Two Years and Qian to Five Years; The Bank Seeks to Recover 800,000 Yuan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The embezzlement case involving Qian Yuzhai, the deputy general manager of the Jiangxi Yumin Bank headquarters, and Wu Meisun, the manager of the Shanghai branch, has been judged by the court. The bank has filed a civil lawsuit seeking to recover 800,000 yuan. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Suspension from Duty for Investigation</p>
<p>Jiangxi Yumin Bank is a joint public-private venture with a capital of one million yuan, half from the public and half from the private sector. In March of this year, the public shares were increased by one million yuan, bringing the total to two million yuan. Chen Wei was appointed as the general manager and Qian Chengxin as the manager. After auditing the accounts, they discovered that Qian Yuzhai, the deputy general manager of the headquarters, and Wu Meisun, the manager of the Shanghai branch, had committed embezzlement. In July, they reported the matter to the provincial government, which ordered the provincial public security bureau to arrest Qian and Wu and transfer them to the High Court Procuratorate for handling. The Nanchang District Court Procurator was also ordered to investigate. At the same time, Qian and Wu were suspended from their duties. After two months, the investigation was completed, and public prosecution was approved.</p>
<p>Verdict and Sentencing</p>
<p>The case was judged by the Nanchang District Court a few days ago: (1) Wu Meisun, the manager of the Shanghai branch, was found guilty of breach of trust and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The facts are that on November 26 of last year, the Shanghai branch purchased 580,000 yuan in public bonds for the headquarters to collect coupons. At that time, it was not reported to the headquarters or recorded in the accounts, and the transaction slips were not sent to the headquarters for review. It was only reported to the headquarters after the price dropped, causing losses to the bank. The detailed account prices reported did not match, and the procedures were incomplete, indicating speculative and profiteering behavior by purchasing public bonds through the bank.

<p>The Shanghai China National Products Manufacturers Association, recognizing that the markets in Guangdong and Guangxi have historically been invaded by foreign goods due to convenient sea transportation, which has greatly affected the national economy and people's livelihood, consulted with the Guangxi Provincial Government this summer to lead manufacturers to hold a national goods exhibition. The provincial authorities expressed their great welcome and designated two locations in Nanning City, the Guangxi Provincial Education Association and the Guangxi Museum, as the exhibition venues. The association then sought participating manufacturers and applied to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for the issuance of tax exemption and transportation reduction certificates. Later, due to changes in the political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, it was virtually delayed. Now that the association considers that the Guangdong and Guangxi issues have been resolved and economic relations are becoming increasingly close, and at the same time, the manufacturers' tax exemption and transportation reduction certificates have been issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, in order to promote its rapid realization, it has decided to send personnel to Guangxi in the next few days to first coordinate with the provincial authorities to prepare everything. Then, it will wait for instructions to lead the manufacturers to set off and will hold a touring exhibition in important cities in Guangdong and Guangxi after the exhibition in Nanning, in order to strengthen the recognition of national goods by the people of Guangdong and Guangxi and benefit the production and sales of national goods.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association Requests a Limit on the Market Price of Flour; Document Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, recognizing that flour is an important food for residents, has been greatly affected by the recent soaring market prices. Most of the businesses in the industry are small-scale, and they have suffered huge losses, resulting in daily closures. If no measures are taken to suppress prices, it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, yesterday, it specifically requested the Social Affairs Bureau to limit the market price in order to remedy the situation. Not only will the industry benefit, but the livelihood of the people and the foundation of the nation will also depend on it. The original document is as follows:</p>
<p>"Presented for the soaring price of flour, which is related to the future of the people's livelihood and affects the safety of the country, we request that your bureau order a limit on the price, prohibit exports, crack down on speculation and manipulation, balance the market situation, and maintain the people's food supply and the stability of the business community. It is believed that flour is a necessity for the people's food supply, and the rise and fall of its price, and the amount of its production and sales, should be subject to unified control and regulations by the country, so as to balance supply and demand and eliminate the evils of speculation and monopoly. If it is allowed to run its natural course, then many evils will arise. Not only will operators be affected, but the people will also encounter the panic of high food prices and the inability to maintain a livelihood, which is related to the safety of the country. According to reports, wheat has had a bumper harvest in various places this year, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the country and should not lead to price increases. Unexpectedly, during this tense time of national crisis, flour prices have soared, rising rapidly without end. This is obviously caused by unscrupulous merchants manipulating and speculating in secret. If it is not stopped, not only will the impact on our industry be worrisome, but also the future of the people's food supply will be greatly affected. The association does not dare to remain silent and especially appeals to your bureau to quickly stipulate the maximum price of flour, not exceeding three yuan and three cents per bag, and prohibit exports, hoping that you will review and approve the order for implementation, so that the society and the business community will benefit from it. This is the presentation."</p>

<h3 id="e142">The City's Fourth Annual Municipal Games Closed Yesterday - Dat-sha, Chih-tse, Physical Education School, Teachers' College, and Tung-a Won Championships - Awards Ceremony to be Held on Another Date <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The fourth annual municipal games, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, concluded successfully yesterday morning after two and a half days of competition. The men's championship in the college group went to Da Xia, while the men's championships in the physical education school and teachers' college groups both went to Tung-a. The awards ceremony will be held on another date. Overall, although the games were somewhat disorganized on the first day due to the excessive number of groups and the complexity of the affairs, the situation improved after the second day. The officials and athletes were in good spirits. Although the results were not entirely satisfactory, there were few unnecessary disputes during the games.</p>
<p>Due to changes in the regulations, this year's games were not held according to the old rules, so it is impossible to compare the records with previous years. However, a table comparing the best results of each group with the highest records of the municipal games shows that in women's track and field, seven records were broken and one was tied, excluding the 50-meter dash and the long jump. In men's track and field, only the discus record was broken, with the others falling far short. Two conclusions can be drawn from this: (1) The women's results were better than the men's, and the results of the female physical education teachers were even better. It is also unusual that the men's high jump results in the college and physical education school groups were not as good as those in the high school group. (2) The highest records of the municipal games were set three years ago, as the third municipal games organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education were held in 1933. This indicates that the athletic performance of men in this city has not improved in the past three years, and those responsible for sports should pay close attention to this.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong, 25th) In the preliminary round of the Lai Wah Cup football tournament, held on the 25th, Hua Lian faced the Army team. Veteran players Li Huitang, the Four Knights (Bao Jiaping, Mai Shaohan, Huang Meishun), Liang Rongzhao, Chen Hongguang, and others were unable to participate. The team was composed of new players such as Huang Hua, Ji Liangxian, Zan Linde, Pu Hezuoxian, Zeng Zhongyun, and Yang Benhan. Many spectators believed that the team was not strong enough and would surely lose. However, the result was unexpected. In the first half, Chen Dehui scored one goal, and Benhan scored two goals, giving the team a 3-2 lead. In the second half, the opposing team scored one goal, tying the score. After 20 minutes of overtime, Dehui scored another goal, giving the team a 4-3 victory. At the same time, the Clerks' team defeated the Navy team 4-1. Hua Lian and the Clerks will compete for the championship next time.</p>

<p>Yousheng team, which was recently promoted, played against Fudan team in the Chinese Football Middle League at Fudan Stadium yesterday.

Tao Yingjie made his first appearance of the season and appeared unfamiliar with the game. Fudan dominated the first half, scoring four goals. After the break, Yousheng showed some improvement and scored two goals, but Fudan's offense remained strong and they scored another seven goals. The final score was Fudan 11, Yousheng 2.

<p>The results of the Western League football games this week, after fierce competition in the past two days, were as expected in Group A. However, some of the scores were unexpected. French Merchant defeating St. Francis 7-2 was still within reason, but Portugal defeating West Merchant was surprising. Yesterday, Donghua only defeated Soquel by five goals, which was not entirely satisfactory. However, the complete defeat of West Capture, losing 14-2 to Lux, made it difficult to believe that West Capture was so weak. At the same time, recalling that Lux lost 4-5 to Lancashire last week, but yesterday Lancashire only defeated Jinan by two goals, with a 0-0 tie in the first half, made people feel that Jinan was not the weakest team, and Lancashire was also unpredictable. Overall, Donghua has a 55% win rate and remains in first place, but the scoring record has been taken over by Lux. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua and Soquel met at the Municipal Stadium yesterday. Chen Zhenhe was unable to play due to dysentery, and Wanxianghua was also injured and served as a linesman. The lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Association</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang, Feng Yunyou, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Wu Binghao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Binghao and Linjing scored three goals each</p>
<p>After the kickoff, the Soquel team attacked first, and the Donghua team fought against the sun. In the blink of an eye, they reached the opposing team's territory. Within 20 minutes, Donghua attacked more than a dozen times. Dai and Sun had many dangerous shots, and Jia also had many good opportunities, but all failed. Once, Sun's diagonal shot from the baseline was extremely beautiful, but Bao Shengwei jumped up and caught it, which was greatly praised. The Soquel team also had three chances to advance, but they all returned empty-handed. Until the 25th minute, the five forwards of the Donghua team advanced in a line. Dai headed the ball to the left, and Wu Binghao caught up and kicked it with his right foot, straight into the left corner, starting the scoring. Two minutes later, Dai was standing with his back to the goal at 30 yards, and Feng Yunyou passed the ball from the center line. Dai stepped on the ball and quickly rotated, kicking the ball flat into the net, which was extremely beautiful (2-0). Soon, Jia Youliang scored again, but it was disallowed due to offside. The two sides then gradually calmed down. In the 40th minute, Xu passed the ball to Dai, who dodged slightly, letting the ball pass over his head. Wu Bing happened to be on the baseline, and he caught up and kicked it, as fast as a falcon. The players on the field were all stunned, and the ball had already entered the right corner of the net. The Soquel team captain and linesman protested to the referee, Mr. Shen Huichun, claiming that the ball had entered from outside the net. After Mr. Shen examined the net, there was no possible way for the ball to enter from outside, so he ruled that Donghua had scored (3-0). Soon, Wenkui's shot hit the left post and bounced back. At halftime, Donghua led 3-0.</p>
<p>Linjing was heroic and scored two more goals</p>
<p>After the break, Donghua fiercely pressed forward, shooting dozens of times, but all were fruitless. In the 16th minute, Sun Jinshun's cannonball-style low shot was caught by Bao Niuwei, who pounced on it, which was extremely lucky. Soon, the ball entered the middle, and Dai Linjing advanced alone, directly under the goal. The audience all raised their hands to celebrate, thinking that he would definitely score, but Dai's foot was slightly off, and the angle was off. Mei Lin Aofski happened to catch up from behind and tried to block the shot, but unexpectedly it backfired and the ball bounced off his own foot, rolling into Bao Shengwei's crotch and gradually becoming an own goal (4-0). The Soquel team launched a large-scale counterattack. Li Ning was in extremely poor condition yesterday, and at this time he was penalized for a foul. The Soquel right winger took the kick from 30 yards, hitting the crossbar straight down, with a very accurate angle. Fortunately, Rongcai jumped up and caught it. Just as he was about to kick it out, the Soquel left forward and winger caught up and hooked it, so he was penalized. Before long, Donghua encountered another dangerous situation. When Ai Bo Lietekov shot from afar, Rongcai jumped up and missed, fortunately hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Feng Yunyou desperately ran out, fighting fiercely with the Soquel team, and finally escaped the dangerous situation. After that, the two sides alternately advanced and retreated. Until the last two minutes, Dai Linjing scored into the net again. The game started at the center line, and the final whistle sounded loudly, with Donghua winning 5-0.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Development Process of the Japanese Silk Industry <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Baoguang</p>
<p>(I) The Value of the Silk Industry in the Japanese Economy</p>
<p>Sericulture is the second largest agricultural product in Japan after rice. The silk reeling industry is Japan's oldest and a fundamental modern industry. Silk fabrics are Japan's largest export in international trade. Therefore, the silk industry occupies a crucial position in Japan's rural economy, capitalist economic structure, and international trade balance.</p>
<p>The Japanese silk industry not only holds an important position in Japan but also dominates the world. Japan is the world's largest producer of raw silk and the largest exporter of silk fabrics.</p>
<p>(I) Value in Farm Household Economy</p>
<p>The importance of sericulture in Japan's agricultural economy is clearly demonstrated by the ratio of sericulture households and the ratio of production prices.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Taisho era, Japan had 5.438 million farm households, of which 1.5 million were sericulture households, accounting for approximately 27.6% of the total. This number gradually increased, and by the fourth year of the Showa era, the number of sericulture households reached 2.217 million out of a total of 5.576 million farm households, accounting for 39.8% of the total. Subsequently, due to the global economic panic, silk prices plummeted, and Japanese rural areas were the first to suffer a significant blow. Consequently, the number of sericulture farmers gradually decreased. By the ninth year of the Showa era, sericulture farmers accounted for 1.995 million out of 5.617 million households, representing 35.5% of the total.</p>
<p>Rice is Japan's largest agricultural product, and cocoons are the second largest. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the third year of the Showa era, the total value of agricultural production was over 3.8 billion yuan, with rice accounting for over 1.8 billion yuan and cocoons accounting for over 660 million yuan, approximately 1.7% of the total. In the fourth year of the Showa era, the total value of agricultural products was 3.48 billion yuan, and cocoons were worth over 550 million yuan, accounting for slightly less than 16%. The seventh year of the Showa era was the most economically depressed year for Japanese rural areas. The total value of agricultural products decreased to about 2 billion yuan, and the value of cocoons decreased to 297 million yuan, accounting for 12%.</p>
<p>Although cocoons are the second largest agricultural product in Japan after rice, they occupy a position above rice in terms of Japanese farm household income. This is because Japanese agriculture is still dominated by small farmers, and the rice produced by small farmers is mostly consumed by themselves. Therefore, there is hardly any rice available for sale. However, the cocoons produced by ordinary farm households are all commercial goods, making cocoons the largest source of cash income for sericulture farmers. Therefore, the economic value of sericulture in Japanese agriculture is even more important.</p>
<p>(II) Value in Industrial Economy</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Showa era, the total value of Japan's industrial production was over 5.98 billion yuan, and the value of raw silk and silk fabrics reached 590 million yuan, accounting for 9.7% of the total. In the ninth year of the Showa era, due to the prosperity of military demand and export industries, the value of industrial production increased to 9.39 billion yuan. However, raw silk and silk fabrics decreased to over 560 million yuan due to the impact of the global economic panic, and the ratio to total production value relatively decreased to 5.9%. Nevertheless, it remains an important sector in Japan's industrial economy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to statistics from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the ninth year of the Showa era, there were 80,300 factories in Japan employing five or more workers, with silk reeling factories accounting for over 5,000. Of the 2.13 million workers in Japan, over 360,000 were employed in the silk reeling industry. This also fully demonstrates its considerable importance.</p>
<p>(III) Value in International Trade</p>
<p>Silk fabrics are Japan's largest surplus commodity in international trade and occupy a special position in the international balance of payments. This is a rare phenomenon in the impoverished Japanese economic structure, from raw material manufacturing to export.</p>
<p>In the third year of the Showa era, Japan's total international trade exports amounted to 1.9722 billion yuan, with silk fabrics accounting for 878 million yuan, representing 44% of total exports. In the sixth year of the Showa era, Japan's export trade decreased to 1.41 billion yuan, and silk fabric exports also decreased to 400 million yuan due to the global recession, reducing the proportion of total exports to 28%. In the tenth year of the Showa era, Japan's export trade surged to 2.48 billion yuan, with silk fabrics accounting for 479 million yuan, relatively decreasing the proportion of total exports to 15%. Although the export value of silk fabrics has gradually decreased due to the global economic recession, the general decline in purchasing power, and the atmosphere of expanding military demand and the activity of some export industries in Japan, it remains the largest source of revenue in Japan's international balance of payments.</p>
<p>(II) Current Status of the Japanese Silk Industry</p>
<p>The Japanese silk industry is also following the path of Japanese capitalist economic development and progressing upward step by step. In the early Meiji era, during the process of Japan's economic construction, efforts were made to increase silk production, improve technology, and expand international trade without any reservation. In the Meiji 22-26 era, the silk production volume was only 1.1 million kan (Note 1), and the export trade volume at that time was only 19 million yuan. By the Meiji 44 era, the production volume increased to over 3.4 million kan, and the export volume increased to over 129 million yuan. In 20 years, the degree of development tripled, and exports increased sevenfold. Subsequently, the outbreak of the European War further developed the Japanese silk industry. Before the war, in the third year of the Taisho era, the production volume was 3.75 million kan, and the export volume was 160 million yuan. After the end of the European War, in the eighth year of the Taisho era, the production volume reached 6.36 million kan, and the export volume reached over 623 million yuan.</p>
<p>The reasons for the leap forward in the Japanese silk industry are twofold: (1) government encouragement and promotion, and (2) the stimulus of the general economic development of Japan and the expansion of the international market. Regarding the former, the government encouraged farmers to raise silkworms and promoted exports. The Export Promotion Law was promulgated on April 1, Meiji 21. In the 33rd year, the export tax of 123 yuan and 61 sen per 100 yuan was abolished, and funds were loaned to purchase new machinery to improve technology. In the Meiji 22-26 era, those using machinery accounted for 41%, and those using old-fashioned production methods accounted for 59%. By the Meiji 44 era, those using machinery accounted for 70%, and those using old-fashioned methods accounted for only 30%. In terms of sericulture, production methods also progressed, and even in terms of quality, there was a significant upward trend. In the early Meiji era, the cocoon harvest per cho (Note 2) of mulberry garden was only 7 kan. By the 40th year of Meiji, the average increase in harvest reached 9 kan, and the maximum reached 11 kan. By the eighth year of the Showa era, it increased to over 15 kan. Because of the progress in production technology, the ratio of mulberry gardens to cultivated land and the ratio of sericulture farmers have only increased by 25% from the early Meiji era to the present, but the production volume has increased sixfold, and the export volume has increased six hundredfold. Regarding the latter, during the period when various economic sectors in Japan were developing upward, such as the textile industry, transportation, various basic industries, and the cultural level of the people, coupled with the stimulus of the markets and colonies seized after the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the European War, Japan leaped to the throne of the world silk industry.</p>
<p>Since the global economic panic of 1929, the Japanese silk industry has been hit hard. Originally, sericulture in Japan had been the only clothing material since ancient times due to the lack of cotton. Therefore, during the shogunate era before the Meiji Restoration, the export of silk was strictly prohibited several times. By the time of the Meiji Restoration, the emerging textile industry gradually rose, and the large amount of cotton yarn imported into Japan from the United Kingdom, as well as the cotton yarn and cotton fabrics produced domestically, gradually replaced the position of silk fabrics. Therefore, present-day Japan has changed from a silk fabric-based country to a cotton fabric-based country, and silk fabrics have become an export commodity. As a result, Japan's silk fabric exports have been increasing year by year as previously mentioned. The relationship with the international economy and the dependence on international trade have also gradually expanded. Therefore, changes in the world economy are fully reflected in the Japanese silk industry. Hence, when the global economic panic struck, the Japanese silk industry was the first to be hit.</p>
<p>Due to the prosperity after the European War, the export value of Japanese raw silk and silk fabrics reached 878 million yuan in the third year of the Showa era and 943 million yuan in the fourth year of the Showa era. In the fifth year of the Showa era, affected by the global economic panic, the export value drastically decreased to 488 million yuan, of which raw silk accounted for 419 million yuan and silk fabrics accounted for 68 million yuan. The export destinations of silk fabrics were mainly India and Australia, followed by the United Kingdom and Manchuria. Because Japanese silk fabrics are high-end products, buyers are mostly wealthy people. Therefore, even in the autumn of the global economic panic, silk fabrics were still able to maintain their original position. However, raw silk was different. The largest export product among Japanese silk products is raw silk, and the most important export destination for raw silk is the United States. In the 14th year of the Taisho era, Japan's raw silk export value was 877 million yuan, and the amount imported into the United States reached 844 million yuan, accounting for 96.4% of the total. In the fifth year of the Showa era, due to the general global recession, Japan's raw silk export value drastically decreased to 419 million yuan, and the proportion exported to the United States decreased to 95%. In the ninth year of the Showa era, due to the severity of the global recession and the prevention policies of various countries against Japanese goods, Japan's raw silk export value decreased to 287 million yuan, creating the lowest record in more than ten years. Although it recovered to 387 million yuan in the tenth year of the Showa era, it is still a major threat in the lame economic process of Japan. Moreover, there are two noteworthy phenomena in the process of shrinking exports: (1) The export value decreased by 51%, while the export volume only decreased by 5%. The fact that this expresses is that silk prices plummeted. Although the plummeting of silk prices is a major threat to the Japanese industrial economy, it is a fatal blow to the Japanese rural economy. This point is clearly demonstrated by the bankruptcy of the Japanese rural economy in recent years. (2) The amount imported into the United States accounted for 96.5% of the total in the fourth year of the Showa era, gradually decreasing to 84.1% last year. This trend is expected to continue to decline. On the contrary, exports to Europe have increased from 2.3% to 11.8%. This proves that the dependence of the Japanese silk industry on the United States is gradually decreasing, while the dependence on European countries is gradually deepening. Now, the table of the recent Japanese raw silk export value and regional relationship ratio is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Raw Silk Export Status Table</p>
<p>(Note) Export amount unit: 1 million pounds, export value unit: 1 million yuan, the ratio is 100 in Showa 4, and the export destination amount is 100.</p>
<p>(1) The status of Japanese silk production during the panic process. As previously stated, the dependence of the Japanese silk industry and international trade is profound. Therefore, the changes in the prosperity and decline of the international economy proportionately dominate the entire Japanese silk industry. The climax of the global economic panic invaded various departments in 1929, and the Japanese silk industry, which was directly dominated, also underwent tremendous changes.</p>
<p>The production value of Japanese cocoons was 84.8 million kan in the 14th year of the Taisho era, with a total value of over 814 million yuan. In the 4th year of the Showa era, the total production value decreased to 10.2 million kan, but the total value decreased to 655 million yuan. In the 5th year of the Showa era, the global economic panic struck. Although the production value continued to increase to 10.6 million kan, the total value drastically decreased to 304 million yuan. Afterwards, it decreased year by year. In the 8th year of the Showa era, it once recovered to 500 million yuan. However, in the 9th year of the Showa era, the production value decreased to 87 million kan due to the successive attacks of severe wind and flood disasters, cold disasters, and droughts, and the total value fell to 202.8 million yuan. Compared with the highest record in the 14th year of the Taisho era, it decreased by 75%, which is indeed the biggest blow to the Japanese rural economy since the Meiji Restoration. Therefore, since the 4th year of Showa, the number of sericulture households has decreased from 2.3 million to 1.99 million, and the area of mulberry gardens has decreased from 714,000 cho to 623,000 cho. After that, there is still a tendency to decrease.</p>
<p>The raw silk production status also changes with the stages of the global economic prosperity and decline. In the 14th year of the Taisho era, the total raw silk production value was 8.28 million kan, with a total value of 956 million yuan. In the 3rd year of the Showa era, the production value increased to 10.58 million kan, and the total value decreased to 835 million yuan. In the 5th year of the Showa era, the production value increased to 11.36 million kan, and the value decreased to 536 million yuan. By the 9th year of the Showa era, the production value increased again to 12 million kan, the highest record in Japanese production, but the value decreased to 398 million yuan, the lowest record in nearly 20 years. The value increased to 488 million yuan in the 10th year of the Showa era, so the situation last year and this year has some hope of recovery compared with the 9th year of the Showa era.</p>
<p>Although cocoon prices and raw silk prices have plummeted, and the total production value has fallen by 25%-29%, the production value of silk fabrics still maintains its original state. This means that silk fabrics are consumables for special classes. Although the world is in such a recession, the consumables of special classes can still maintain their original state. This proves the class nature of the panic. The production price of Japanese silk fabrics was 327 million yuan in the 5th year of the Showa era. In the 9th year of the Showa era, the most economically depressed year for the Japanese silk industry, the total production value of silk fabrics increased to 341 million yuan, and it continued to increase to 349 million yuan in the 10th year of the Showa era. After that, there is still hope for increase.</p>

<p>(Note) Production amount unit: 1,000 kan, value amount unit: 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The impact of the silk industry on the Japanese economy during the panic.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the global economic panic affected the poor performance of Japanese raw silk exports. The poor performance of exports affected the plummeting of silk prices. The plummeting of silk prices directly affected the plummeting of cocoon prices and further affected the interests of silk reeling operators and the income and expenditure of farm households. The scope of the impact of this shadow in the dissemination process is getting bigger and bigger. Therefore, if it is said that the silk industry is the initial driving force of the economic panic in Japan in recent years, it is no exaggeration.</p>
<p>Cocoons are the second largest agricultural product in Japanese rural areas, and they are the only commodity and the only income and expenditure among agricultural products. Therefore, the rise and fall of cocoon prices are the indicators of the economic prosperity and panic of rural areas. The average price of 1 kan of spring cocoons and autumn cocoons in Japan has long been maintained at a level price of 4 to 5 yuan in the Meiji era. After the outbreak of the European War, it gradually rose, and it rose to 11 yuan and 57 sen in the 8th year of the Taisho era, the highest record in modern Japanese history. It was 10 yuan and 58 sen in the 14th year of the Taisho era, and then it gradually declined. It dropped to 7 yuan and 6 sen in the 4th year of Showa, and it drastically dropped to 3 yuan and 10 sen when the world panic struck in the 5th year. It fell to the lowest price of 2 yuan and 45 sen in the 9th year.</p>
<p>The plummeting of cocoon prices severed the only economic source of farm households, and the rural economy had to fall into bankruptcy. Typical evidence of rural bankruptcy in Japan, such as the total amount of debt in Japanese rural areas, was only 1.3 billion yuan in the era of Taisho 14. However, according to the latest survey estimates, it will reach 6 billion yuan. Therefore, in the current Japanese rural areas, banks and landlords are rising, and more and more poor farmers are selling green seedlings and cold silkworms (Note 3) at low prices when they are in short supply. The hungry children in rural areas are even more concentrated in the cities, which affects the living conditions of the general working class in the cities. Therefore, labor wages are falling and labor hours are extending, creating the bankruptcy of the entire Japanese working class in recent years.</p>
<p>The same bankrupt phenomena are occurring in the silk reeling industry as in the rural areas. In the 14th year of Taisho, there were 3,643 factories in Japan using mechanical silk reeling, and the number of spindles was 276,000. It was reduced to 235,000, 3,260 factories in Showa 10, and the number of spindles was also reduced from 162,000 to 48,000. This gradual decline is, of course, the result of elimination during the panic.</p>
<p>(3) The scale of silk reeling and various equipment.</p>
<p>Although Japan is the kingdom of silk in the current century, its business form still maintains the operating methods of handicraft industry and even family industry. Therefore, small and medium-sized factories account for an absolute majority of more than 90% and hold a dominant position in the Japanese silk industry.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in the 14th year of Taisho, there were 110,000 weaving machine factories. More than 104,800 factories had less than 5 machines, accounting for 94% of the total. There were more than 2,900 factories with 5 to 10 machines, more than 2,400 factories with 10 to 50 machines, and only 218 factories with more than 50 machines. By the 9th year of Showa, the number of factories with less than 5 machines decreased to 61,800, the number of factories with 5 to 10 machines increased to more than 4,600, the number of factories with 10 to 50 machines increased to more than 5,700, and the number of factories with more than 50 machines increased to 691. The total number of factories decreased to more than 72,900.</p>
<p>Number of Japanese weaving factories</p>
<p>The above table fully proves that Japan's silk reeling industry is still a small-scale family industry. Now, under the elimination of the panic, it has entered a new trend. Small factories are gradually decreasing, and large factories are gradually increasing. However, the transformation of the times to enter a sound path like the textile industry still requires time.</p>
<p>At present, the more healthy business forms are roughly four.</p>
<p>(A) Katakura Silk Reeling: Founded in March of the 9th year of Taisho, with an authorized capital of 53.55 million yuan and a paid-in capital of 26.775 million yuan. It has built 45 factories in the main sericultural areas, with an equipment capacity of 14,950 spindles. The production capacity reached 952,111 kan in the 9th year of Showa, making it the largest silk reeling factory in Japan.</p>
<p>(B) Gunze Silk Reeling: Founded in the 29th year of Meiji, with an authorized capital of 20.6666 million yuan and a paid-in capital of 15.297 million yuan. It has established 23 factories in the main areas across the country, with an equipment capacity of 11,048 spindles. The production amount reached more than 916,000 kan in the 9th year of Showa, making it the most historical silk reeling kingdom in Japan.</p>
<p>(C) Nippon Silk Weaving: Founded in June of the 7th year of Taisho, with an authorized capital of 450,000 yuan and a paid-in capital of 350,000 yuan. It has established 6 factories in various main areas, with more than 34,000 silk weaving spindles and 1,343 weaving machines. The production amount in the first half of the 9th year of Showa was 11,000 tan.</p>
<p>(C) Nippon Spinning: Founded in August of the 7th year of Taisho, with an authorized capital of 1 million yuan and a paid-in capital of 913,000 yuan. It has established a new-style factory in Kiryu City, with 53,000 spinning spindles and a production amount of 32,500 kan.</p>
<p>(4) The future of the Japanese silk industry and the current status of control.</p>
<p>The Japanese silk industry is dominated by the prosperity and decline of the world economy and the changes in international relations. At the current stage, it is impossible to restore the prosperity of the 14th year of Taisho.</p>
<p>At present, the entire international relationship is spinning in the vortex of economic competition among various imperialisms. The entire trade policy is completely dominated by the consciousness of self-sufficiency, forming an economic bloc within its own sphere of influence. Therefore, since the Ottawa Agreement formed the British Bloc, Japanese cotton cloth exports to the British territories have been severely hit. Since the realization of the American Bloc, Japanese exports to the United States have been greatly affected. For example, before 1929, Japanese raw silk exports to the United States accounted for 96% of the total. In recent years, due to the domestic economic recession, weak national purchasing power, and even the increase in tariffs to prevent the import of Japanese goods, the amount of Japanese raw silk exported to the United States has decreased from 54 million pounds to 42 million pounds year by year, and the ratio has decreased from 96.5% to 84.1%. It is difficult for Japanese raw silk dominated by the current American trade policy to restore its original state. In addition, although there has been an increasing tendency in European countries in recent years, there is no room for development under the current changes in international relations and the pressure of trade policies. In addition, the only optimistic one is Manchuria, but due to climate relations and rural economic bankruptcy, there is no possibility of development at present. As for the domestic consumption problem in Japan, it is even more impossible to expect an increase in the purchase of silk fabrics in today's rural economic depression, small and medium-sized business and industry recession, and low living standards of the working class.</p>
<p>The Japanese silk industry cannot be optimistic in the international market, and cannot be expected in the internal market. A strong regulatory agency appeared in this panic process of being in a dilemma. The regulatory agency is also a means of trade policy in the economic panic process, a way to break through the status quo, control production internally, and encourage progress in living technology, and develop the market externally.</p>
<p>Originally, the regulatory facilities of the Japanese silk industry had the establishment of the silk industry cooperative in the 44th year of Meiji. In the 15th year of Taisho, it was changed to the Central Association of Silk Industry Cooperative. It comprehensively guides and controls the affairs of the silk industry. Until the 59th Congress of the 6th year of Showa, the Silk Industry Cooperation Law was promulgated. Based on this law, the Japan Central Silk Association was established. In March of the 7th year of Showa, the Central Association of Silk Industry Cooperative was dissolved, and it became the highest regulatory agency of the current Japanese silk industry.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the government's trade policy, the Japan Central Silk Association controls the Japanese silk affairs. Its organizational outline is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Japan Central Silk Association</p>
<p>National Sericulture Industry Cooperative Federation - Prefectural Sericulture Federation - County/City Sericulture Industry Federation</p>
<p>National Silkworm Seed Industry Cooperative Federation - Prefectural Silkworm Seed Industry Federation - Silkworm Seed Industry Manufacturers</p>
<p>National Industry and Silk Reeling Industry Cooperative Federation - Prefectural Industry and Silk Reeling Cooperation - Silk Reeling Industry Industry Cooperative</p>
<p>National Silk Reeling Industry Cooperative Federation - Prefectural Silk Reeling Industry Cooperation - Silk Reeling Operators</p>
<p>National Raw Silk Sales Cooperative Federation - County/City Raw Silk Sales Industry Cooperation - Raw Silk Sales Federation</p>
<p>National Raw Silk Export Industry Cooperative Federation - City Raw Silk Export Industry Cooperation - Raw Silk Export Federation</p>
<p>〇 Special Council</p>
<p>(Note) □ Group 〇 Individual</p>
<p>(3) The Development of the Japanese Silk Industry and the Chinese Silk Industry</p>
<p>Silk has a longer history in China than in Japan. For thousands of years, it has been used as the only clothing material. Until cotton was introduced from India during the Yuan Dynasty, it gradually seized the inherent position of silk, and silk products became luxury items. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, the mechanical industry has flourished, and international trade relations have become increasingly close. Therefore, the silk industry has become the only export product of China for a time. It not only occupies a special position in China's foreign trade but also holds the most important position in China's rural economy and even industrial economy. Since the development of Japanese silk, due to the government's policy of encouraging exports and the progress of production technology, China's inherent silk market in Europe and the United States has been gradually encroached upon, and the Chinese silk industry has gradually fallen into the abyss. China's raw silk export trade reached more than 148 million yuan in the 11th year of the Republic of China, accounting for 22% of the total trade exports. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the export value reached 165 million yuan. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it dropped to 95 million yuan, and it further dropped to 36 million yuan in the 21st year, reaching an unprecedented low record. This is in the Chinese rural economy, especially the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, on the verge of bankruptcy. In the Chinese industrial economy, 107 silk reeling factories in Shanghai and Wuxi, more than 90 factories stopped work. In China's international trade, it lost a major compensation amount, and the impact will not only be the bankruptcy of one part of the silk industry.</p>
<p>In short, the decline of the Chinese silk industry is closely related to the rise of the Japanese silk industry, especially the protectionist trade policy implemented by Japan. However, the progress of production technology, the improvement of management methods, and the uniformity of control steps in the Japanese silk industry are also worthy of deep consideration by the people who are being driven out.</p>

<p>Young artist Jin Xuecheng, a native of Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, has been studying sculpture in Japan for eight years. Last year, he graduated from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and was at the top of his class. Soon after, he was selected for the Second Division Art Exhibition. At that time, Japanese newspapers praised him extensively and he achieved great honor. His reputation reached China, and many domestic art schools, admiring Jin's name, sent letters of invitation. However, Jin remained true to his artistic sincerity and humbly declined all offers, continuing to immerse himself in artistic research. He diligently pursued his art, and his skills advanced greatly. Recently, the Japan National Art Exhibition, the Bunten, announced that Jin had once again been named to the list. For eight years, Jin's efforts in art have been unwavering, allowing him to rise steadily and achieve great depth. On the day of the announcement, Tokyo newspapers all published Jin's photo with great fanfare, praising him as the first honorary crown for a citizen of the Republic of China. It is said that the authorities at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts believe that in the over two [missing number] years of the Bunten's history, Jin is the first foreigner to be selected for the Japan National Art Exhibition, so they have submitted a request to the Japanese government to commend him in order to show goodwill and provide encouragement.</p>

The original telegram is as follows: "To Minister Wang Shijie, Chairman of the China Boy Scout General Association, forwarded by the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: When the Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout team participated in the National Inspection and Camping competition in Beijing, the camp daily newspaper arbitrarily slandered and fabricated facts, issued unfounded criticisms, and published them in various newspapers in Beijing. Furthermore, it published unofficial total scores in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai the next day. Although the General Association sent letters to various newspapers to make corrections, it is certain that malicious individuals are using written propaganda to deliberately undermine the Shanghai Boy Scout cause. In addition to reporting to the General Association, we are reporting this matter to you. We respectfully request a thorough investigation to uphold fairness.

<h3 id="e157">Sudden Obstacles to Silk Exports to France <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Tianda</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Chinese silk has suffered from the impact of the global economic panic, the squeeze from Japanese silk, and the dumping of rayon. In recent years, foreign trade has plummeted, almost following in the footsteps of Chinese tea, with a sense of being at the end of its road.</p>
<p>In 1934 (Republic of China Year 23), the national export volume was only 32,977 quintals (approximately 52,773 piculs), worth 23,519,150 yuan (approximately 16,833,788 taels), the lowest export year since the Republic of China and a year of extreme decline. Compared to the peak export year of 1929 with 189,980 bales worth 147,681,388 taels, the quantity was less than one-third and the price was less than one-eighth, truly an extreme decline.</p>
<p>"When things get bad enough, they must get better." After a period of extreme decline, there must be a day of renewed prosperity. This is the principle of the economic cycle. Last year (1935), the global economy gradually recovered after a long period of withering, and the sales of Chinese silk turned around slightly. Furthermore, due to the government's implementation of the new currency policy, foreign trade suddenly became active. Last year, Shanghai alone exported 55,007 bales of raw silk, and Guangdong shipped out 42,231 bales, totaling 97,238 bales. Silk mills in Shanghai and Wuxi also started operations one after another, believing that the golden age was coming again.</p>
<p>This year, due to weather conditions, the silkworm cocoons were of poor quality, and the reeling loss was quite high. Therefore, although the silk market was often at 600-700 yuan, silk mills only barely covered their costs and had no profit. The autumn cocoons also suffered a poor harvest (50% in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year), resulting in a shortage of raw materials and high prices for cocoons. Increased costs, if silk prices do not rise and sales are hindered, silk mills will inevitably feel the difficulty of turnover again, and the plight of the previous year may well be repeated today.</p>
<p>Recently, the French government abandoned the gold standard and devalued the franc. The exchange rate between Chinese currency and the French franc suddenly dropped from 464 francs per 100 yuan (September 25) to 630 francs (currently quoted by the Central Bank). Chinese silk transactions suddenly came to a standstill, which has had a significant impact on the export of raw silk from our country. Some believe that our country's exports to France are not important, and that France's silk consumption is small, not as large as that of the United States, so there is no need to worry. In fact, Chinese silk sales to France have their own unique position, which I will explain below.</p>
<p>(2) The Importance of Chinese Silk Sales to France</p>
<p>France has always been a country with a large consumption of silk, and Chinese silk sales to France have a long history. Narrow stripes of 9-11 and 13-15 are specialties of our country, far superior to Japanese silk. Since the outbreak of the European War, the global economic situation has changed, and the financial center has shifted to New York. Due to the vast land, developed industry and commerce, and high consumption by a wealthy population in the United States, silk consumption has surged, and it has become the country with the highest raw silk consumption in the world. As Japanese silk focuses on sales to the United States, it has also risen to the top position of raw silk exporting countries. Chinese silk sales, on the other hand, have been dominated by France. In the French market, Japanese silk is not our enemy, while in the American market, Chinese silk is not to be taken lightly. Below is a table of raw silk imports by country in France over the past decade:</p>
<p>Table of Raw Silk Imports by Country in France Over the Years (Unit: 100 Bales)</p>
<p>From the above table, the position of Chinese silk in France is unparalleled by any country. No matter how fast Japan progresses, it still cannot compete with us. However, the rapid advancement of Japanese silk in the American market is something that we can only look up to.</p>
<p>Table of Raw Silk Consumption by Country in the United States Over the Past Decade (Unit: Bale)</p>
<p>Percentage Comparison Table of Raw Silk Consumption in the United States Over the Last Ten Years</p>
<p>(Note) The above table's months and years run from July to the end of June each year</p>
<p>From the above table, the expansion of Japanese silk's power in the American market has left almost no room for Chinese silk to exist. Under the condition that it is gradually being excluded from the American market, the urgent need to maintain its local market is an unchanging principle. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Last week, from October 19 to 24, the market situation of the Huashang Securities Exchange fluctuated quite a bit. The reason was that the current situation was unpredictable, sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, and people's hearts were uneasy. Moreover, since this month's futures are approaching, swap trading was quite lively. How the future will unfold is still unpredictable. Looking back on last week, on Monday, the yarn and cotton market soared, slightly improving the stock market. On Tuesday, the environment was dull, and the public generally believed that peace could be declared, so major investors bought in, rising from one or two cents to six cents. On Wednesday, the five meetings between China and Japan were relatively smooth, continuing to rise from four cents to eight cents. On Thursday, due to extensive swap trading, rumors arose again, and selling pressure increased, falling back slightly from five cents to eight and a half cents. On Friday, there was still mostly swap trading, and the environment was still very dull, with market prices showing ups and downs. On Saturday, people's hearts were still not invigorated, and the situation was still impossible to predict. Major bullish investors exited, continuing to fall slightly from one cent to half a yuan. Today is the last day of this month's futures, and there may still be competition. As a result of the week's market prices, except for types A and B, which fell slightly by five cents and one cent respectively, all others rose by as much as one and a half cents. The total trading volume was 49,775,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the news from Liverpool was not good, so the bulls settled their positions and cotton farmers hedged their sales, causing the price of each month to fall by four to five pounds. Then, the advances from domestic and foreign peers were equal to the hedged sales amount, and it became slightly stable. Although observers said that the collections could reach 12 million bales, the public deeply believed that there were still discounts. The weather forecast was that the East had clouds, North Carolina had rain, and the Central and West were partly cloudy and partly sunny. At the close of the market, short positions were covered, with spot prices falling by three pounds and futures prices falling by three to seven pounds. British spot cotton fell by one point, and futures fell by five to six points. Indian cotton initially fell due to large-scale selling by futures traders, but then recovered due to short covering and retail buying. In total, Pingguer fell by 1.5 rupees, and Aomula and Bairoxi fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (telegram of the 24th):</p>
<p>Pingguer 156.71 down 1.50 29.00</p>
<p>March futures 156.50 —— 19.00</p>

<p>March futures 195.00 —— 35.00</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 545 trucks arrived from various origins, carrying a total of 12,450 shi. Among them, the majority was newly harvested Bo Dao. Therefore, although the market situation was assisted by 2,000 packages of Pingjin Qingyan Dalian, etc., and nearly 2,000 packages of thick Xin Geng, as well as more than 200 packages of Bo Po, but because of sluggish retail sales, the middle-grade goods of Kai Lu, Zhong Baige, etc., were soft and damp, and the price was reduced by two or three cents, and those with higher prices could not stand firm and were devalued by half a cent. Ye Baidao and Yishi Xing, etc., also fell by one cent. Only the Su Tong Chang Geng was fortunate to have limited arrivals, and the market was balanced between arrivals and sales. Various types of new jian, such as Du Yang, etc., were only sold in cities and towns, and the market also followed and lowered by a few cents. After a period of sharp decline, the sales of Xin Yin Yuan moved slightly, seeming to be stabilizing.</p>

<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, about 30 shipments arrived from Hexia. The sales of various rice types in the market were sluggish in the morning, and the situation improved slightly in the afternoon. The market shape of Xin Geng Yang Bu Jian was flat and tired in the morning, and firm in the afternoon. The prices of Xin Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan continued to fall by about one cent. Yao Zhong was scarce, and various early rice types were tired. Ke Jian Du Jian was settled.</p>

<p>The pepper producing areas continuously telegraph increases, and the quoted price of incoming goods needs to be above 43 yuan. Therefore, the city has also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the market sold No. 1 goods for 43.5 yuan, and both Sichuan and Hubei merchants made transactions. No. 1 goods are still holding the line, and are temporarily unwilling to sell.

<p>Now is the time when rice is ripe and crabs are fat, so large numbers of crawling generals are sent from elsewhere to Shanghai, displayed on the streets for people to view. Therefore, when we walk on the road, we are all struck by this group of swaggering crawling generals. However, crawl as you may, you will soon be served as a side dish, let's see how long you can crawl!</p>
<p>Crabs are also called "Intestineless Gentlemen." Yes, they have always crawled lawlessly, wanting more after getting something, truly liverless things! It's no wonder everyone wants to eat their flesh.</p>
<p>"Shrimp soldiers and crab generals," crabs are warriors in the water. However, they insist on coming ashore to swagger, so I give them a big name called "Marine Corps."</p>
<p>Crabs live in the water, but they insist on not being content with their lot and invade the land, not knowing that they have become a delicious treat for people and sacrificed their lives. Crabs, I advise you to be content and live your life in the water!</p>
<p>"Crawling" and "tyranny" are linked. Crabs are crawling generals, crawling from the water to the land. If it were to say that this crawling is "the kingly way," that would truly be shameless. Fortunately, crabs cannot speak, but those who can speak may be worse than even crabs?</p>
<h3 id="e165">Crab <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Wearing a lined robe still doesn't provide enough warmth. At this time of year, the iron cages outside the cooked food shops on the streets of Shanghai begin to imprison the so-called "Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs." During this crab-eating season, gourmets hold wine glasses, laughing constantly. Vendors buy them in bulk, weighing them in units of twenty liang, and sell them by the catty, weighing them in units of thirteen liang and four qian. With a quick turnover, they only need to tie on a few strands of rice straw rope, and their pockets swell up like crab nets. Naturally, they can't help but beam with joy. As for the crab catchers, although they grope along the riverbank on dark, moonless nights, it's quite laborious, but with a little effort, they can easily catch baskets and hampers full of crabs, exchanging them for cash in the market to make a living. So, although crab catchers work hard, they usually have smiles on their faces during this crab-eating season. Laughter, laughter, laughter! Everyone is quite happy during this crab-eating season. The exception, the ones who should be shedding tears, I think, are the crabs that should be living happily in the water but are innocently caught, sold, and ultimately eaten, right?</p>
<p>Humans are, after all, smarter than crabs. Humans know that crabs are attracted to fire. Therefore, they often hang a lantern on the crab traps to lure the crabs to climb to the surface, waiting to be caught. After being caught, they are imprisoned in dark places to prevent the crabs from seeing the light and moving around. Because the more actively the crabs move after being removed from the water, the thinner they become. And when steaming them in a pot, their two claws and eight legs must be firmly bound to prevent them from making a final struggle at the bottom of the pot. According to gourmets, once a crab struggles at the bottom of the pot, the leg meat often becomes loose, and sometimes it is completely empty, greatly diminishing the flavor. Although the methods humans use on crabs are deceptive and cruel, who told them to hide a belly full of good stuff, arousing the appetites of gourmets when they see it? "A gentleman is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing treasure." I hold a similar view of the unfortunate crab.</p>
<p>"Famine of ropes, abundance of mosquitoes, cheap shrimp, chaotic crabs," is a popular saying among farmers in the Suzhou and Shanghai area, predicting the weather and human affairs. Several years ago, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers overflowed, fulfilling the "famine of ropes" saying. This year, there are few ropes and many mosquitoes, indeed, a bountiful autumn harvest, demonstrating a remarkable omen. Before the Qi-Lu War, crabs were plentiful and cheap in the Suzhou and Shanghai area, with one yuan buying four catties of large crabs. Then, the war broke out. In the autumn before the January 28th Incident, the crab production in the Suzhou and Shanghai area was also very abundant, but soon after, turmoil occurred again. Although this is a coincidence, the saying of "chaotic crabs" cannot be denied as worth preserving. Therefore, I hope that from now on, crab production will decrease daily to avoid crab chaos. However, the gourmets of the world will surely consider my words a great damper and pray daily that my words will fortunately not come true.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Random Talk on Sharp and Rounded Sounds <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>The autumn scenery is gradually fading, and the purple crabs are becoming plump. Passing by the Five Clouds Sunrising Building, one sees everywhere the sideways-walking, armored knights, killed and cooked to satisfy human desires. I wonder if those in the world who daily engage in military expansion and aggression feel any fear or caution from this.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of crabs. Those from Yangcheng Lake and Taihu Lake are called lake crabs, filled with yellow fat, and are considered a delicacy. Fenhu Lake in Wujiang has purple pine crabs, which Lu You described in his poem as "round navels, piled high, Wujiang crabs." Tan Tang in Changshu has Tan Tang crabs, with soft shells and curled claws, also of high quality. Weizhou Village in Kunshan has Wei Chi crabs, rich in oil and overflowing with roe, with a flavor that is not inferior to lake crabs, but they are not as large.</p>
<p>Min Xi of Gui'an, styled Yanru, was fond of poetry and drinking, often sleeping drunk in taverns all day long, and often compared himself to the Minister of Personnel. He was good at painting crabs. Anyone who wanted him to paint would first have to offer him wine and food. He would paint from life after getting drunk, fully capturing their sharp and rounded forms. It is a pity that few of his surviving works have been passed down.</p>
<p>Shengtan stated: "Someone who excessively loved crabs was warned by others. He then made a vow, saying, 'I have a great wish, may I in my next life not be born where there are crabs, and may I not eat them.'" His words are curious and interesting, and perhaps Shengtan was talking about himself, which is unknown.</p>
<p>The large crabs that people call "zha crabs" should actually have "zha" written as "zha," meaning that they are eaten boiled in soup. The "Qing Jialu" has an entry about "zha crabs." "Zha" is pronounced zha. The pronunciation was mistakenly changed, and thus became "zha."</p>
<p>Lu Junshi E, who was skilled in medicine, said: "Any crab that has worms in its belly that look like small white stinkbugs should not be eaten, as eating it can easily cause wind disorders. Crabs are salty, cold, and slightly poisonous, and should not be eaten with zi or Jingjie. Crab roe can turn lacquer into water, so it is most effective for treating lacquer sores. It is said that burning crab claws can attract rats into the room, but I have never tried it. Buddhist books say that they wither and die after scattering their eggs. Food before the frost has poison, and after the frost, when they are about to hibernate, they taste delicious. The saying that they enter the sea is also nonsense."</p>
<p>There is a special way to eat crabs. Hang the crab on a rope, cut off half of its legs, so that they flex and extend automatically, and place a bowl underneath. The yellow and white will flow down from the tips of its legs. In less than an hour, the shell will be empty. The flowing yellow and white are mixed into chicken eggs and stewed to eat, the taste is fresh and unparalleled. But it is too cruel and inhumane, and benevolent people do not do it.</p>
<p>Among the delicacies, there are those who peel crab meat and crab roe and place them in crab shells, coat them with dry flour, and then fry them. I don't know what it's called. I think it should be called "crab shell yellow," which is very different from the oil-crisped and baked cakes sold on pancake stalls.</p>
<p>If you are poisoned from eating crab, and you suddenly don't know what medicine to use, you can quickly use orange peel with the pith removed, boil it into a soup, and drink it to detoxify. Also, crabs with eyes facing each other and spotted feet and red eyes should not be eaten. Also, cooked crabs have a bright red back shell, hence the poet's line, "In old autumn, there is no escape from a red back." However, if you cook the crabs with three to five zi stalks, they will turn blue.</p>

<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>These days, in the long streets and short alleys of Suzhou, one can often hear the cries of "clear crabs" for sale. The jade-like flesh and golden roe tempt the gourmets, and one cannot help but salivate. It reminds me of the late master of classical learning, Madam Tang Guoli, wife of Zhang Taiyan, who said: "If Yangcheng Lake crabs weren't so good, why would I live in Suzhou in this life?" It can be seen that the taste of crabs from Yangcheng Lake is truly moving!</p>
<p>Weiting, which is close to Suzhou, is known as the "land of fish and rice," and borders Clear Lake, which is especially famous for producing crabs. Therefore, as soon as the autumn wind rises, Weiting becomes a crab market. All the crabs are transported by train and ship to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places every day. However, the ones sold in the long streets and short alleys of Suzhou are directly from the countryside after being caught by farmers, so the prices are also lower. Therefore, in late autumn, anyone visiting Suzhou will buy Clear Crabs and return home to feast on them.</p>
<p>"When the rice ripens, the crabs are fat." During this rice-harvesting season, it is the time when "Clear Crabs" enter the market. Although "nine for females, ten for males," it is only past Mid-Autumn Festival, but because this year is not a leap year, it is already the season for chrysanthemums to bloom. Then, "round navels in September," this is the time! Gourmets can move their index fingers and hold their bowls.</p>
<p>The methods farmers use to catch crabs, in addition to setting nets, planting traps, and catching them by boat, the most common method is to plant poles in shallow water at dusk and hang lanterns on them. The gutless gentlemen who sink into the water see the light and come crawling, one after another. The farmers then spread mats on the ground, lie on the mats, and wait for the crabs to crawl over, and catch them with their hands. They are always successful. Those in the world who tend to be sycophantic, often falling into the net, are like these crabs!</p>
<p>There are different ways to eat crabs. I think the best way is to tie the eight legs and two claws of the crab with twine, put them in a steamer, and eat them while steaming, without letting them cool down. The taste is the most rich and delicious. If you boil them with water, you will inevitably lose the true taste. Crabs are cold in nature and have a fishy taste. After eating them, people in Suzhou are accustomed to drinking red sugar soup to relieve the cold, and then wash their hands with chrysanthemum leaves or white wine to remove the fishy taste.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Crab Tales <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>When boiling crabs, you must add a little perilla to test whether the crab is poisonous. If it is poisonous, the shell will definitely burst and cannot be eaten. It also has the effect of dispelling cold.</p>
<p>If you want to store and raise fresh crabs, you can use a jar, spread rice grains inside, put a layer of crabs on top, then spread another layer of rice grains, filling it layer by layer, and seal the mouth of the jar. Even after two or three months, they may not die, but once they are exposed to air, it will be completely ineffective. And after two or three months, the crabs will definitely be fatter than when they first entered the jar. Readers may want to try it.</p>
<p>When eating crabs, in addition to always serving with ginger vinegar and fine wine, you should also drink a cup of brown sugar water after eating, preferably with one or two slices of ginger in it, so as not to catch a cold and have a stomach ache.</p>
<p>Crabs and persimmons cannot be eaten together, as eating them will inevitably be fatal, causing excruciating abdominal pain. In addition, peanuts should not be eaten together either.</p>
<p>When boiling crabs, use cold water, and you must tie their claws and feet tightly with thin rope beforehand, otherwise they will easily fall off. The best way to eat crabs is not to boil them in water, but to tie the crabs and steam them on a rack in a pot. The taste is more delicious and palatable than boiling them in water. However, they must be washed clean.</p>
<p>To observe whether the crab's abdominal membrane is plump or thin, you can observe the phases of the moon. Crabs are always fattest during the dark moon and thinnest during the full moon.</p>
<p>When eating crabs, the fingers easily develop a crabby smell, which tastes very unpleasant. You can wash your hands with shochu and then scrub with soap and hot water to remove the crabby smell.</p>
<p>The above are all based on experience, so I dare to tell the readers.</p>
<p>Special Announcement In last Monday's "Fruits and Flowers of Autumn" special page, the second article was originally the manuscript "Persimmons," but during typesetting, the previously typeset "Boy Scouts" article, which was awaiting publication, was mistakenly inserted. The proofreaders did not change it, resulting in a mismatch with the topic of the special issue. We hereby declare this and apologize to the readers. (Juan)</p>

<p>The festive season enters Double Ninth, holding a crab and cutting tender ginger. This is a crab poem sung by people in the past. Crabs are wonderful things, paired with reed wine and Xuan oranges, the flavor is excellent. Round navels in September, pointed in October, a seasonal fresh product, no wonder gourmets move their index fingers and feast on them.</p>
<p>Avoid using copper utensils to cook crabs, as eating them will definitely cause a chronic illness. Also, crabs with eyes facing each other, or spotted feet and red eyes, are all poisonous, and eating them can also kill people. Also, crabs are cold in nature and should not be eaten with persimmons or beer. According to a certain book, Shi Guogong wine and crabs eaten together can cause dysentery in mild cases and death in severe cases. Natural properties are incompatible, and you must know this.</p>
<p>According to crab catchers, the best crabs to choose are those with a green back, white belly, and red hair. It is also said that if you are poisoned from eating crab, quickly use orange peel with the pith removed, boil it into a soup, and drink it to detoxify. Another prescription is to mash fresh lotus root sections into a mud-like state and take it with hot wine.</p>
<p>Yunlin's Anecdotes contains a method for cooking crabs, saying to boil them with fresh ginger, perilla, orange peel, and salt. Once it comes to a boil, turn them over, and when it comes to a big boil, eat them. It is best to boil and eat the crabs one by one. At a rate of one person, you can boil two, eat them, and then boil more. Serve with mashed orange ginger vinegar.</p>
<p>Ancient people recorded special books about crabs, such as Gao Yisun's "Crab Treatise" of the Song Dynasty, Chuan Gong's "Crab Manual" of the Song Dynasty, and Lu Guimeng's "Crab Records" of the Tang Dynasty. It is a pity that they cannot be bought in bookstores, and one cannot quickly see them.</p>
<p>The various names of crabs, such as Gutless Gentleman and Sideways-Walking Armored Knight, are known to everyone. A more obscure one is Containing-Yellow Elder. "Qinglu" says: "Among the tastes of the four directions, Containing-Yellow Elder must be allowed to be the first," referring to crabs. It is also said: "Because he injured his tongue by eating a claw, he jokingly called crabs Tongue-Clipping Insects."</p>
<p>In zoological terms, crabs belong to the crustaceans among arthropods. The carapace of crabs is large, measuring more than a foot, and small, measuring like beans. In their larval stage, their shape is like shrimp. When they become adults, they shrink their tail segments and stick them to the cephalothorax, differentiating into pointed and rounded shapes by gender.</p>
<p>In China, the areas famous for producing crabs are Jiangxi and Zhejiang, such as the Mogang crabs of Haiyan, the Shiyan crabs of Yuyao, the Yangcheng Lake crabs of Kunshan, and the Jinzhao crabs of Yandang, all of which are well-known. As for this place, Shengfang Town in Wen'an County, Hebei, and Niuzhuang crabs are also very famous.</p>
<p>Crabs, when the frost falls and the oranges turn yellow and the tangerines turn green, the roe is full and the meat is fat and solid. The poems of the ancients have "Sending off guests with round crabs after the frost, orange slices fragrant yellow crabs are fat," which is clear evidence. (Teng Hua Xuan Master)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Crab Talk <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>Pufferfish are prized in spring, purple crabs are plump in autumn, there is a time for everything. In the hot Jiangnan summers, sideways walking is not uncommon, but because they eat too much poisonous buttercup, they easily harm the mouth and stomach, and those who care for themselves do not dare to try them lightly. Moreover, at that time, the roe is not yet solid, empty and unsubstantial, what Su Dongpo called not worth the loss. By the time the autumn wind is tight, the grain is on the stage, they fatten by picking up the ears, and cleanse with frost. When cooked, they startle the plate, with vermilion backs and many gelatinous abdominal membranes, both quality and taste are complete. In the countryside in September, the river water turns cold, the weishi guard and catch, everywhere. The candles illuminate the cages, twinkling and dimming, no different from late ferries at Guazhou, or night moorings at Fengqiao. Reeds are rustling, dark dew and falling wind, the viewers on the sandy shore work hard, quite envious of the harvest, thinking of their return journey with the moon waning, the heavy cold overwhelming, turning to compassion. How can the pleasure of pounding ginger in the attic and sharing rhymes under the moon be compared? I already feel the rivers and mountains coming alive with the wine. How can the flavor before this bottle be described? These are all matters for refined people, what do the fishermen have? Therefore, it is not too much to be rare with autumn crabs, to reward their labor with what remains, which is also a way to adjust material resources.</p>
<p>One crab is not as good as the other. The analogy of human affairs getting worse and worse, which Song Tao Gu used to ridicule King Qian Chu of Wuyue. The words are rude, but the meaning is quite long. According to Wuyue, since Miao Qi Zuo, he drove away Huang Chao from outside, and executed Dong Chang from inside, governing fourteen states, a dazzling hero. Yuan Guan succeeded to the throne, defeated by Min in the east, already feeling overshadowed. And Zuo Yu and Zong, treacherous officials and strong neighbors, attacked each other, and the situation became more precarious. As for Chu, he only knew to exhaust his national strength to make offerings. Talents declined day by day, what was there to wait for Gu to say! However, no one does not want to be a hero, and it is a matter of performance to return to the name in reality. Without striving for efforts, he will leave the envoy's face righteous, and after hundreds of generations, he will still not be able to bear to feel sorry for Zhongyi! There is also a vulgar saying that the crab is an analogy of people's perversity and incomprehensibility, saying, "See how long you can run rampant?" This sentence is also worth thinking about deeply. Wearing armor and imitating Yi, trampling on the rivers and lakes, the recipient dare not punish them, and think of themselves as invincible in the world; I do not know that the Qin people fear crabs, drowned in ignorance, and when they are familiar, they only feel that the skills are only this: Although He Bo is patient, the fish and shrimp are already angry, and the cold ropes are bound, it is difficult to escape the high autumn red back. Extrapolating from things to people, using a family to represent a country, those who are appropriately dissatisfied are originally the same.</p>
<p>In the past, Sima Xiangru's articles imitated the behavior, and people compared him to a crab, and Wenjun finally ended her life, forbidding him to eat it. This matter is unusually beautiful and can strengthen conjugal love when heard. Xiangru is not a crab, but Wenjun compared the person to Xiangru, viewing him as real; despising him, in fact, is loving him to the extreme. What luck does the crab have to be called the same as Changqing, and to gain the compassion of that beauty? This makes me fondle the ancient scrolls, and I do not dare to write; the meaning must be that Xiangru's feelings are sincere, which is enough to move him. It is not the case now, last night's good night, tomorrow's strangers, deceiving weak women like this. Secretly throwing a hug, rushing to the east, deceiving cowardly husbands like this. Deep gratitude in the beginning, buying each other with gold, so the way of husband and wife is bitter. As for dying in middle age, the grass is not yet autumn, or marrying a rich man, or continuing the string: although this is more excusable, then the former meaning of choumu is also unbearable to ask. Because I eat crabs, I can't help but yearn for the ancients.</p>

<p>Youmei waved her hand repeatedly and said: I dare not say that. But my cousin's thinking is very new, and his attitude is a bit different. As she spoke, she seemed to hear a bit of laughter in the room. Youmei was silent for a while, but still looked at the curtain twice in a row, and then laughed: Cousin, what are you doing in the room? Can I come in for a visit? Guoqi answered from inside: Please come in, but it's very impolite. Youmei stood up and smiled at Mrs. Zhang: Auntie, please accompany me to see my cousin's study. Mrs. Zhang smiled: Guoqi, this child, doesn't have any hobbies, he just likes to arrange the room. Although it is very time-consuming, it doesn't cost any money. It's better than gambling, eating, and drinking. As she spoke, her face showed a happy look, and she got up and walked towards the study. Here, the curtain was lifted, and Guoqi was seen wearing a summer cloth long gown, and his hands were fastening the buttons. Youmei nodded and said: Cousin is too formal. It's such a hot day, why do you have to wear a long jacket at home. Guoqi said: Miss Li rarely comes, so I should be respectful. Youmei stood in the middle of the room and looked around. She laughed: I remember coming to this study once last winter. I hurriedly took a book and left. Although I didn't look carefully, it's not like this now, the room is green. Guoqi said: In winter, the room needs sunlight, so it's brighter. In summer, it's okay for the room to be a little green. In fact, this is the power of those three bamboo curtains outside the window. Youmei looked at his desk, two tea tables, both planted with tall pearl orchids in white porcelain pots. Although it was noon, because it was in the room, there was still a faint fragrance. On the horizontal beam of the window, a row of four pots of spider plants were hung. In addition, there were small potted plants on the bookshelf and table. She smiled and said: Cousin likes orchids the most, right? Guoqi said: How does Miss Li know? (Eight Nine)</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Path to Human Health: Appropriate Methods for Preventing Aging <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>...A famous German doctor dissected fifty-six corpses of premature deaths and discovered all their secrets...The longest-lived person in ancient and modern times was an Englishman, Thomas Parr, who lived to 151 years and nine months... Scientists from various countries are working to increase the potential for human life expectancy</p>
<p>Each part of the human body has a marvelous function. If the main glands that initiate this function, the gonads, weaken and atrophy, then disease is most easily contracted, and aging occurs earlier. The famous German physiologist Dr. M. Rosenbach collected fifty-six corpses of premature deaths and subjected each to precise dissection. He found that all lacked strong reproductive glands, making them vulnerable to deadly bacteria, leading to premature aging. This proves that if the reproductive glands can be cultivated to be strong, one's spirit will be full and diseases will not arise. Although immortality cannot be achieved, one can still enjoy a high age of over eighty years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many examples of extremely long-lived people from ancient times can be cited, but only a few can be confirmed. The Englishman Thomas Parr can be considered a reliable piece of evidence. He died in 1635, living 152 years, nine months, and seven days. After his death, the famous physician Dr. Harvey dissected his corpse. His internal organs were very healthy, especially his reproductive glands, which showed almost no signs of aging. Therefore, for hundreds of years after his death, scholars from various countries have not denied that Parr's longevity was entirely due to his particularly strong reproductive glands.</p>
<p>Based on this example, humans can live to 152 years without much sign of aging, as long as the reproductive glands are properly cared for. Therefore, we humans, at a minimum, can live to this age. Moreover, today is different from the past, and medicine and other sciences are very developed. For example, the invention of gonadal extract preparations called "Glandular Extracts" by the Austrian physiological master in recent years is clear evidence that establishes the foundation for this theory. Looking at medical journals in various countries, reports detailing the efficacy of this preparation from doctors are available, leaving no room for doubt. For example, Germany uses this agent to treat patients with sexual neurasthenia. At the same time, the same female preparation is used to treat infertility and menstrual irregularities in underdeveloped female citizens, with tens of thousands benefiting each month. If it is said that this efficacy is still difficult to satisfy the desires of scientists, then countries like England and France use this preparation to reduce smokers. According to investigations, the restorative effect of "Glandular Extracts" in quitting smoking has been adopted by the League of Nations. The French "Anti-Smoking Alliance" used this preparation to help 428 addicts of more than fifteen years, 765 of more than ten years, 3,896 of more than five years, and 7,653 of more than three years to quit smoking in just three months. From this, it can be seen that the efficacy of gonadal extract preparations has revealed the gospel of extending human life!</p>
<p>Ginseng and bird's nest are the only things that the Chinese people rely on to prevent aging, but successful scientists from various countries have never paid attention to them. At the same time, the particularly high mortality rate among Chinese people has made this outdated replenishment method likely to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Dr. William T. Rabinack, a famous German doctor who resided in Peking for three years, told people: "I firmly believe that if the Chinese can seek nourishment according to scientific principles, they may be the first country to invent the art of immortality in the future. It is a pity that the path they take is close to word games, so even though they have ginseng and bird's nest as tonics, they are not as beneficial as seeking longevity through science abroad." As winter approaches, it is time to replenish. Should the Chinese people, in light of this warning, change their course?</p>

<p>(1) Masturbation Sacrificed His Studies</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Xinchun, 21 years old, from Hang County, Zhejiang, complained - he was an excellent student in arithmetic when he was young. At the age of sixteen, he was lured by obscene books and became addicted to masturbation, thinking it was fun. Initially, there was no effect, but after half a year, he gradually felt his thinking was slow when calculating and he often couldn't solve problems smoothly. After a year, his grades plummeted, and the teacher was surprised. He often felt uneasy and realized the harm of masturbation. He immediately tried to quit, but he still had seminal emissions, sometimes with dreams and sometimes without dreams, getting worse day by day, even emitting twice a night. He had no heart to study, his memory almost disappeared, and he was easily startled and angered, with night sweats and insomnia, dizziness, and lightheadedness. At the age of nineteen, he had to drop out of school to recuperate, but there was no improvement after more than a year. Current symptoms - unstable sperm, weak body and kidney deficiency, abnormal endocrine. Treatment method - using the latest European and American treatments, first giving him "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Pills." In less than a month, the nocturnal emissions stopped. Then, "Glandular Extracts," a preparation of gonadal extract, was given to replenish his weakness. He was made to take it regularly for two months and undergo electrotherapy. His body gradually became stronger, his brain power recovered, and his mind became clear. After reviewing his old lessons, he found it very easy and can resume his school life.</p>
<p>(2) A Husband Who Regained His Beautiful Wife's Favor</p>
<p>Patient Mo Tianyin, 30 years old, from Chaozhou, Guangdong, complained - he had the habit of masturbation when he was young, but fortunately, he quit it. However, he did not develop fully, and had premature ejaculation after marriage, which was despised by his beautiful wife. Medical history - at the age of seventeen, he could not restrain his lust and masturbated for years, with very few breaks. Later, he read books and knew its toxicity, and reluctantly quit it. He got married at the age of twenty-six, and his wife was extremely beautiful, so he sought pleasure, but he had already suffered from premature ejaculation, and his genitals were smaller than those of ordinary people. Although he tried his best to please her, it was ultimately difficult to win his wife's heart. Current symptoms - underdevelopment and premature ejaculation. Treatment method - Mr. Mo's illness was caused by masturbation damaging his developmental functions. The only way is to strengthen his reproductive glands to make the local development perfect and promote its function to return to normal. Therefore, a large amount of the gonadal extract preparation "Glandular Extracts" was administered, and electrotherapy surgery was used as an aid. After one and a half months, miraculous results were achieved. He developed completely, premature ejaculation was cured, and he greatly pleased his wife. He came to the clinic to thank him, and praised the magical effect of "Glandular Extracts." (Note that "Glandular Extracts" are packaged in iron boxes. Those in paper boxes and bottles are fake imitations. Therefore, only by purchasing genuine products can they be effective. "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" are the same, and are also packed in iron boxes. Fake medicines are not only ineffective, but also have drawbacks after taking them because they are poorly prepared.)</p>

I was so angry that I wrote to my husband, blaming him for his sins. He bought two boxes of "Anti-Gonorrhea" for people to treat gonorrhea and one box of "Leukorrhea Cure" as a suppository, and I was able to cure the disease.</p>

<p>Mr. Gu Ziyuan from Xixians Road, Shanghai, wrote: I am forty years old and have suffered from stomach pain for about three years, and I can barely eat. A friend advised me to smoke opium. I thought of quenching thirst with poison, which is not a good strategy. I have taken various medicines reported in the newspapers, but they have rarely been effective. When I took the two medicines "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Elements," I gradually felt relieved. To this day, the chronic disease is gone, and I can eat as well as before.</p>

<p>Ms. Ge Yuemei from Kaifeng wrote: Although I was born in the Central Plains, my body is weak. Although I am over twenty years old, my breasts are still flat, and I often have leukorrhea, which I always feel hatred in my heart. Recently, I talked with a female classmate about my hopes for health and beauty. She introduced me to take "Female Glandular Extracts" internally, and use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally to treat leukorrhea. After two months, the leukorrhea disappeared, and my breasts became high and erect. The deficiencies of several years have been remedied at once, which is a happy event.</p>

<p>I have a chronic disease of seminal emission, so I bought "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to treat it. At the same time, I used "Glandular Extracts" to save my weakness. Unexpectedly, after taking it, it was ineffective. It was completely different from what patients with the same disease said about how effective it was. I didn't know that the paper box and bottle that I bought were all counterfeit medicines until I told a friend with the same disease. I entrusted him to buy the genuine product in an iron box, and then I was cured. I am afraid that patients will be deceived, so I especially submit this article to tell everyone.

<p>Common Knowledge About Bone Pain</p>
<h3 id="e178">Causes and Rational Treatments for Low Back Pain <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>When young and strong, people are often conceited about their superior energy. Some, in order to show off, do things in the workplace and sports field that exceed their physical capacity. Some seek pleasure, indulge in desires, and forget to return. After a while, the body has been damaged. In humid weather or after overwork, you feel a slight ache between the bones. At that time, you feel that your energy surpasses that of others, and you do not take it seriously, still wasting your energy as before. Over time, bone pain becomes deeply rooted in the person's body. By middle age, it flares up every festival, causing the back to bend, the back to curve, and old age to loom. Looking in the mirror, you don't know where the energy of the past went, and regret is useless.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must always pay attention and be careful. If you find bone pain at the beginning, quickly buy "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" for self-treatment. This is the only specific medicine for bone pain. The medicinal power can penetrate deep into the bone marrow to remove toxins and eliminate wind. Even if it is long-term bone pain, even to the point of hemiplegia, it can be completely cured, not to mention the mild symptoms at the beginning. However, the earlier you treat it, the less pain you will suffer for a day. Isn't your dragon-horse-like spirit able to suffer less wear and tear?</p>
<p>Have you ever indulged in desire and pleasure without restraint? Have you ever wasted your physical strength regardless of everything? Have you ever endured hardships and suffered a lot of wind and cold? If you have had such facts, you may have planted the seeds of bone pain, and you should pay attention to whether there is bone pain. If you have them, you should treat them quickly. After a long time, although "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" can still have miraculous effects immediately, your pain is too deep.</p>

<p>The reason why it is easy to become addicted to opium is that the cells of the human body, especially the cells of the reproductive glands, which are the source of life, are anesthetized after being invaded by the toxins of opium, and the metabolic function is taken over and assumed by the toxins of opium. Therefore, once the amount of opium is stopped, the cells cannot restore their original ability to function, forming a dying state. It is necessary to inhale a certain amount of opium toxin in order to achieve excitement through the stimulation of the opium power. Thousands of addicts, for this reason, cannot control their sexual life, so they all suffer from impotence and premature ejaculation. Even if they want to have sex, they must rely on opium power, and only after the addiction is satisfied can they try it. The reason why the restorative smoking cessation method is effective is that the medicinal power of "Glandular Extracts" can invigorate the weak reproductive glands, and at the same time enable thousands of cells to become self-reliant, break free from the shackles of being anesthetized, and build a strong anti-toxin defense, so there is no sign of unease and pain during the smoking cessation period, which cannot be compared with other medicines that can only take care of one aspect. Moreover, after the smoking addiction is broken, the foundation of physical health has already been stabilized, which can ensure that you are free from illness for many years. Its well-deserved efficacy is truly amazing.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Progress in the Treatment of Seminal Emission in the United States <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Physician Zhan Nianceng from the American Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>...Threatened the health of the American nation more than a decade ago...Medical advances have swept away the hidden worries of the entire population...How simple and convenient is the latest treatment you see</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, educators and doctors began to notice a phenomenon common among young people: many strong, hardworking, and intelligent children had always maintained excellent grades, but when they reached puberty (that is, from the age of fifteen or sixteen), they gradually became worried and thin, their brainpower also became dull, and their grades dropped a lot, completely different from before. What was causing this?</p>
<p>After a large amount of precise investigation, we found that most of these young people were engaged in fierce masturbation. When masturbation stopped, because the reproductive glands had been damaged, the sperm gate was wide open, and frequent seminal emission occurred. The reproductive glands are the source of life. Since this is the case, their physique will naturally be thin and weak, and their spirit will naturally be distracted. This bad habit is becoming increasingly popular due to mutual seduction among young people and the proliferation of sexual stimulation in society.</p>
<p>These young people will naturally grow up to be neurasthenia patients who cannot endure hard work and whose intelligence and physical strength are low. The children they give birth to in the future will definitely inherit all the weaknesses. The health of the entire nation is then threatened. People of insight talked about masturbation and seminal emission, and could not help but talk about tigers, all citing it as a hidden worry for the previous American government. This attention has led many half-baked doctors to concoct some painless and ineffective remedies, claiming to be the only good medicine for seminal emission.</p>
<p>These ineffective medicines have deepened people's fears, thinking that medicine is ineffective for this disease. This unnecessary worry was swept away after Hemet's method of consolidating sperm was used. This latest treatment contains two steps: First, taking "Hemet's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" can immediately stop seminal emission, consolidate the sperm gate, and prevent it from flowing out arbitrarily or running around in dreams. Second, ordinary treatments often think that the treatment is complete after curing seminal emission, but they do not know that the thinness, distraction, poor memory, weak limbs, impotence, premature ejaculation, and underdevelopment caused by seminal emission cannot be effective at the same time by any sperm-consolidating medicine. The patient should take a large amount of the gonadal extract preparation "Glandular Extracts" to treat his weakness.</p>
<p>These two medicines assist each other and become the two major saviors for sexual neurasthenia patients who are addicted to masturbation and seminal emission. Using "Sperm-Consolidating Pills" alone, the health of the body cannot be improved. Having "Glandular Extracts" alone without first stopping the leakage, the new energy obtained after taking the medicine still flows out of the body and cannot benefit. They have at least two major advantages: one is that the effect is powerful; the other is that it is convenient to take. Just swallow the tablets, without the trouble of injection, suitable for patients to treat themselves. Therefore, this treatment has been adopted by doctors and patients throughout the United States, and seminal emission disease has been quickly overcome by people.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Scientific Rescue of Underdevelopment <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Junshi, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The scope of underdevelopment is quite broad, such as short stature, limb deformities, weak bones, congenital deficiencies, and small genitals. Usually, it mostly refers to the genitals, so the scope of discussion in this article is also mainly the genitals.</p>
<p>Small genitals are a symptom of underdevelopment. The causes can be divided into congenital and acquired. The so-called congenital is due to genital deformities, or diseases in various endocrine glands (such as the pineal gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, thymus, adrenal gland, and reproductive glands, etc.) during development leading to small genitals.</p>
<p>Acquired ones are more common than congenital ones. The main reason is that the reproductive glands have problems, due to the unrestrained abuse of genitals, especially the act of masturbation in childhood, which is most harmful to development, making the genitals small, and phimosis also has a tendency to inhibit development.</p>
<p>Regarding the development method of the genitals, it has recently been researched. Based on the theory of endocrinology, using the gonadal preparation "Glandular Extracts" can promote the function of the reproductive glands, and at the same time make the functions of other endocrine glands with synergistic effects vigorous. Therefore, the genitals will naturally develop and grow. Dr. William L. Holt, a famous German doctor, used the same "Female Glandular Extracts" to treat a virgin who was already nineteen years old, with irregular menstruation, lack of curvaceous beauty, hard and small breasts, and not many pubic hairs. After taking this preparation, she suddenly became a plump and lovely virgin. At the same time, Soronus, a professor of physiology at the University of Rome in Italy, cured more than 3,000 men with small genitals, impotence, and premature ejaculation with this preparation in three years.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Bad Consequences of Untreated Bone Pain <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>...This disease is most likely to occur in middle age...There are very few inventions of effective medicines</p>
<p>I investigated the situation of more than two hundred and fifty patients with hemiplegia. As a result, it was clear that more than 98% had a source of bone pain, and at first, they all had mild aching sensations, all occurring in the waist, back, hands, feet, and both shoulders. This is enough to prove the trend after this disease is not treated, and it cannot be denied that it contains serious dangers.</p>
<p>Regarding the section on bone pain deteriorating and causing hemiplegia, scholars in the past have cited examples to prove it. Although there are some differences in the content, in general, it is recognized that if this disease is not treated early, it is indeed in danger of becoming a serious stroke. This is really a thing that cannot be ignored. Therefore, among all the terrible diseases, the one that is most likely to occur in middle-aged people is this disease. Therefore, there is a need to first investigate the effective treatment of bone pain.</p>
<p>There are many people in the world who feel sore in the waist and back after working a little. In addition to being completely due to physical weakness, it is also due to unclean blood, excessive uric acid, and wind-dampness accumulation. For this reason, in selecting medicine for this disease, it is not only necessary to seek the medicinal power to remove the above-mentioned sources of disease, but also to seek its ingredients that prevent arteriosclerosis. For this reason, at present, in addition to the scientific prescription "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" invented by Dr. Johnston of the United States, there is no other medicine that has the same effect. Regarding the efficacy of "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills," thousands of doctors in Europe and the United States have conducted countless clinical experiments and obtained satisfactory efficacy before publishing it in medical journals in various countries on five continents and introducing it to readers in a general way.</p>

<h3 id="e183">What Happens After the Jing and Wei Rivers Are Separated? <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>On the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Guide Company, the "oldest store to start," had a notice saying: "Our company, in view of the needs of the times, first established the Shanghai Guide Company in mid-August of last year, hoping for the support of people from all walks of life in society in order to obtain satisfactory results. Unfortunately, people at the time misunderstood the true meaning of guidance, causing the emerging business to deteriorate day by day, which was not what our colleagues wished for. Therefore, we announced the closure of the business on the 15th of this month to show the separation of the Jing and Wei rivers..."</p>
<p>Looking at the advertisements posted by the Guide Company in the classified advertisements in the newspaper, those seductive and wonderful sentences saying that "misunderstanding the true meaning of guidance caused the emerging business to deteriorate day by day" is probably not a false accusation. Therefore, the principle of the Social Affairs Bureau to "properly formulate measures, those who aim for genuine guiding tours should be allowed to exist, otherwise they should be prohibited" feels very correct. "Those who aim for genuine guiding tours should be allowed to exist, otherwise they should be prohibited" is, of course, very correct and easy to say, but to identify "genuinely aiming for guiding tours" and "otherwise" is not as easy as writing a few words, not only not easy, but also very difficult. Moreover, even if the Jing and Wei rivers are separated, what measures should be taken?</p>
<p>The reason why it is very difficult is how to identify "genuinely aiming for guiding tours" and "operating an improper business in the name of guidance." Let's take a look at the predecessor of the Guide Company. As far as we know, most of the current Guide Companies have been transformed from previous dance schools, and the guides are mostly the dancers of the previous dance schools. Because the dance schools were banned, their lives told them that they could be guides, so they became guides. Once the Guide Company is banned again, then even if it is said that they will not be reduced to private prostitutes, their lives will tell them to do other things that are "operating an improper business in the name of ××."</p>
<p>So, let's take a step back and say that from now on, the guiding business is a pure "genuinely aiming for guiding tours," but what about those who are "generally prohibited"? If they want to survive, they probably still have to eat, they still have to wear clothes, and they still have to live in houses.</p>
<p>However, should we not "properly formulate measures" because of this? Of course not, this is cutting off food because of choking. However, if we think that treating the head when it hurts is a permanent solution, or wait for the feet to hurt before treating the feet, without trying to cure the root cause, this patient will die sooner or later.</p>
<p>I will just consider this as giving my loyal advice.</p>

<p>— Fangzi</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun:</p>
<p>On the lonely long road, you fought bitterly alone. In the end, just as you said, you were a stubborn ox, unwilling to let go of anything and fighting for every thing. You worked hard to cultivate forward until you stopped the last beat of your pulse. You taught us: we have to work; we young people have to work. Under the solemn banner of national revolution, we work down to earth, every drop counts.</p>
<p>In your life, there is only work. "You don't know what rest is, what entertainment is, work, work, you were still writing the day before you died..." — Mrs. Lu Xun's eulogy, we will work faithfully, and sacrifice for work.</p>
<p>We are locked in a room, without air, without light, the old etiquette, evil forces, and imperialism heavily surround us, invade us, and we are suffocating to death. But we are not willing to die docilely. We want to live! We want new life! We want to attack the dark bastions! Sir, on the eve of this storm, you stood up, went with us to charge, and resolutely led us to the front line.</p>
<p>But you — an old soldier is now in a long sleep.</p>
<p>"You are not dead," we all say you will not die. But your immortal soul will always live in the leaping hearts of every one of us young people. Your flesh and blood have fed us, and under the seeds you have sown, we will unleash a wave of rage of an era!</p>
<p>Although I have never met you, when I first saw you lying in the Universal Funeral Home, you were so familiar, like a long-lost teacher whom I have always admired. If it weren't for the solemn and tragic atmosphere around me invisibly stopping me, I could hardly help but shout affectionately: "Mr. Lu Xun!"</p>
<p>I glimpsed a set of stationery next to you. This set of stationery, ah, is your battleship, your cannonball, it has killed countless enemies. This sharp pen tip is a demon mirror, it mercilessly uncovers all the masks covering the surface, it is a goblin, return it as a goblin: it is a monster. Return it as a monster; it has inspired the thoughts of many people and motivated the spirits of many people.</p>
<p>The autumn sun accompanied the elegy, sorrow mixed with enthusiasm, countless students, workers, and writers, stars gathered together from all corners with feelings of mourning and respect and voluntarily came to the funeral.</p>
<p>"...He is the soul of our nation, he is the clarion call of the new era, calling on the masses to fight for survival! He resists imperialism, he resists the forces of darkness, his life is unyielding to the old age, and he has always worked for the revolution: our mentor" The lyrics followed the crowds in the procession, shaking.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The coffin began to fall into the tomb. We paid our last and most respectful tribute to you, the giant who fought all your life. In the dim twilight, under the pale waning moon, a desolate song echoed in the tomb passage: "May you rest in peace, rest in peace!"</p>
<p>When will we stand in front of your grave and report to you that we have completed your will?</p>

<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>Xiao Ping used the stone pen to add a gun emplacement at the bottom, suggesting it had been destroyed by artillery fire.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed and said:</p>
<p>"We've won! We've won!" A group of people split into two factions, crawling on the ground and scribbling frantically with their stone pens...</p>
<p>"Hey! Let's all draw to our heart's content! You five draw airplanes, cannons, warships… we'll draw soldiers, these are our brave soldiers, resisting you! Look, how spirited they all are…"</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoping shouted as he drew, his body rolling in the dirt pile. His long gown was a mess, white in one place, black in another, completely unrecognizable.</p>
<p>"Okay! We have one, two, three… a total of six airplanes, five cannons. Let's fire!"</p>
<p>"Wait, wait!" Xu Shichang said, "Wait for my Second Battalion of soldiers to arrive before we start!"</p>
<p>What were the soldiers? They were simply the character "丁" (ding), with a head drawn on top, two feet drawn below, and a rifle slung over the shoulder!</p>
<p>After a while, both sides stopped. All that could be seen were white lines drawn all over the ground, but they regarded it as a vast battlefield.</p>
<p>"Xiaoping! Fire your rifles!"</p>
<p>"Alright! Let them fire!" He stumbled and rolled three or four feet, considering it an attack into the enemy's lines.</p>
<p>"Bang crash!"</p>
<p>You bang crash, he also bang crash, everyone bang bang crash crash...</p>
<p>Everyone was in a chaotic huddle, the ones drawing airplanes didn't have time to drop bombs, grabbing handfuls of dirt to throw, even using the stone pens in their hands as cannonballs. But Xiaoping and his group were truly brave, stepping forward to kick the airplanes, warships, and cannons to pieces. In the end, Ying Jinliang's side was considered defeated.</p>
<p>Xiaoping, Xu Shichang, and Lu Jiaju, wiping away the sweat on their foreheads, shouted, mouths and tongues racing:</p>
<p>"Firing requires everyone to have a sense of unity, unity is victory, let's all 'unite'!"</p>
<p>They returned to their ranks. The little lambs, still in the dim evening light, marched on with victorious steps, like a group of long-distance travelers, leaving this place in a grand manner.</p>
<p>Let's all sing a mountain song again!</p>
<p>"A small team of elementary school students, will mostly be talented adults in the future. We don't want to be slaves; we only want…"</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Pig Farmer <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>The pig farmer raised pigs in the "Shamba" (1). Every day, he carried a shoulder pole to nearby shops and purchased leftover food from the "A Zongs" (2) at a low price—rice grains, vegetable scraps, fishy fish scales, and leftover meat slices… two big buckets full, carrying them back to feed the fat pigs, waiting for them to grow up to sell to people for slaughter.</p>
<p>That year, a swine fever epidemic broke out in the vicinity. Animals died one by one like flies encountering cold weather. One day they were fine, the next day they suddenly died. The government sent police to the countryside every day to inspect the burial of dead pigs. The pig farmers were in a panic. Every family in the "Shamba" was struck by disaster.</p>
<p>Chen Dadi said to Li Ahu:</p>
<p>"This is terrible! My wife and children are going to starve!"</p>
<p>Li Ahu replied, "Who isn't? So unlucky. I just brought my family from Tangshan last year, and this calamity strikes this year. Could it be that my wife is a jinx?"</p>
<p>But Ahu's heart was still calm. His pigs were not yet afflicted by the disaster, growing strong one by one: eating and sleeping well.</p>
<p>"May God bless us! Our family has always been kind and has never done anything evil." He prayed to the gods and comforted his anxious, gentle wife.</p>
<p>And the woman also went to the "Bógōng Temple" every day, asking for the protection of "Bógōng" (3).</p>
<p>"Great Bógōng! Protect our family. I love my husband, and I also love my four children. I have done no evil in this life. If I have not cultivated in my previous life, let me ask Bógōng to forgive me. I will slaughter a pig in the future to repay your divine grace."</p>
<p>The village became more and more panicked. Today the Xu family died a pig, tomorrow the A-San family died another pig. The most unfortunate was Chen Dadi, the entire pig herd died, leaving only two: a mother and a child.</p>
<p>The sound of crying spread from Chen's house to Li's house, making people feel sad. Ahu asked his wife:</p>
<p>"Did you go to worship Bógōng this morning?"</p>
<p>"Every day. Who dares to be disrespectful?"</p>
<p>Li Ahu felt relieved. He went to the market again to pick up leftovers. The pig slaughterer, the old Second Boss, said to him:</p>
<p>"Ahu, how many of your pigs are left? Are they sick? I need two pigs this afternoon, two."</p>
<p>Li Ahu proudly replied:</p>
<p>"Heh! Only other people's pigs will die out! Mine are fine, good pigs! But, let me tell you, the price must be higher. What good livestock is there this year?"</p>
<p>The Second Boss smiled slyly:</p>
<p>"Then, you can sell them to someone else. Don't be so rare, I would rather slaughter a few less every day. No one wants to do a loss-making business."</p>
<p>Li Ahu's stomach sank, feeling something was not right: what if those pigs also died? Who could guarantee anything this year?</p>
<p>So he frowned and changed his tune.</p>
<p>"Old Second Boss, let's talk it over. We're old customers, how could I take advantage of you like this? You can come and take them."</p>
<p>After filling his stomach with bread in the coffee shop, Li Ahu felt his idea was not bad. So, on the way home with the Old Second Boss, he talked about his family's good luck, practically beaming.</p>
<p>"It's really thanks to the blessing of the Great Bógōng that we have this good luck!" he said so gloriously.</p>
<p>But a few dozen steps away from home, he faintly heard what sounded like the crying of his wife and children. His heart sank, he frowned, but he still comforted himself: "Maybe it's someone else's family? Such a coincidence!" He rushed home in three steps instead of two.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered the door, he was so scared that his mouth opened wide. His wife, with disheveled hair, was crying and stomping her feet in front of the ancestors' shrine. The children surrounded her crying. He didn't say a word and ran to the pigsty. It was not good. Three stiff pig corpses were displayed in front of him. The pigpen had been sprayed with a lot of medicine by the authorities.</p>
<p>"It's over! It's over!" his heart cried. He ran into the house, forced a smile on the Old Second Boss, and said:</p>
<p>"It's okay, it's okay! You quickly take two of them away."</p>
<p>The Old Second Boss, seeing that the situation was bad, slyly lowered his face and said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I don't dare to take them. The Mata (4) will fine me."</p>
<p>Then he left.</p>
<p>Li Ahu was stunned. A nameless anger suddenly rose from his heart. He grabbed his wife and gave her a heavy punch.</p>
<p>"You jinx! You…" he cursed.</p>
<p>There was another sharp wail from the livestock in the pigsty. Reporting that another pig had died.</p>
<p>(1) Villages in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(2) Cooks.</p>
<p>(3) The local deity worshiped by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(4) Colonial police.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Grandfather and Grandson <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yuyu</p>
<p>Ever since the doctor diagnosed me with early-stage tuberculosis, my family has been urging me to respect the doctor's advice and go for a walk in the park every morning. Persistently going to the park for a walk every morning is indeed the best way to maintain health, even for people without tuberculosis; however, I have a fixed amount of work to do every day, otherwise, our family's stomachs will all stop working. That eternal work has already made me feel very tired. Now, to add another task called "walking" outside of the scheduled time is truly more than I can "bear"! But my wife loves her husband, and my mother loves her son even more. Oppressed by these two great loves, I can only take a copy of the day's newspaper and go for a walk in the park. I always occupy a seat by the small pond, using this time to read some news. Normally, this task is done after dinner, but now it's moved forward twelve hours, perhaps that's the most direct benefit that walking gives me.</p>
<p>This has become a habit after several months. Because this added task is still quite relaxing, and it's just switching the time for reading the newspaper, although I have to leave the bed a little earlier every day, it's actually not much of a loss. As for what effect it has on the hygiene of the early-stage tuberculosis itself, no one can predict that.</p>
<p>There are many people who come to this park for a walk every day. They really come to walk, wandering back and forth. I often calculate how many circles some people have to make by the pond while reading the newspaper, or how many minutes it takes a pair of lovers, like Westerners, to walk across a piece of grass. The ones like me who sit by the pond from the time they come in until they leave are the grandfather and grandson in the title, but this relationship is also what I speculate, maybe it's a son, too.</p>
<p>Now let's assume it's the relationship between grandfather and grandson. The grandfather's age is at least in his late fifties, with a head of long, silvery-gray hair. If he were in a Western oil painting, he would definitely be a great poet. But he is dressed in worn-out clothes, not because he is sloppy, but the holes on the corners of his robe are neatly patched with cloth of the same color. At most, you can only say he is a thrifty old man. The grandson is about seven or eight years old, much more beautiful than his grandfather. In summer, he wears linen overalls, and now he wears wool shirts and trousers. In a few days, I guess he will definitely have a beautiful coat.</p>
<p>They arrive at the park around the same time as me, but I always leave first. Didn't I say that there is a fixed time for work every day? They always come to sit by the pond, too. The grandfather sits on the chair, and the grandson sits on the grass. Then they start their breakfast, which is a bag of biscuits and a piece of bread. The biscuits are for the grandson, and the old man chews on the hard bread. Afterwards, the grandson rolls back and forth on the grass, never stopping for a moment. The grandfather is like a Bodhisattva enshrined in a Buddhist niche, closing his eyes to rest. Occasionally, he opens his eyelids and only glances at the grandson on the grass before closing them again.</p>
<p>When autumn came, they didn't come to the park for a few days. When I met them again a day later, the old man's spirit was even more decadent. He didn't eat bread either, just fell asleep on the grass, letting his grandson splash water by the pond. The sound of bamboo sticks hitting the water surface was "crackle crackle". He pretended not to hear it—perhaps he was really preoccupied with other thoughts.</p>
<p>So I also started to "think." Maybe the old man also has a fixed time to do work every day. That eternal work will make him even more tired than me, but he loves his grandson, so he added this "walking" task. He is naturally more than he can "bear." Closing his eyes every day is probably to prepare for the energy he will spend on the scheduled work…</p>
<p>This guess is unfounded and almost a fantasy. But my thoughts have been limited by that circle. I start from this starting point every day to speculate on the more distant future. I hope the old man lives a long life, hoping that he will continue to greedily chew on a hard piece of bread every day.</p>
<p>Humans are connected by a great love, grandfather to grandson, mother to son, wife to husband… Under the oppression of this great love, everyone's life is determined.</p>
<p>The daily walk will probably continue as long as the scheduled work, because I dare not ask the doctor who diagnosed me what stage my early-stage tuberculosis has progressed to (naturally hoping it has become better).</p>

<p>City Lights</p>
<p>(1) The spring of the city. Never bright and beautiful. Leisurely strolling into the forest of flesh. Impossible to distinguish the fragrance of fat from the smell of sweat. The chirping of birds. Impossible to distinguish between joy and sorrow. The delicate faces of flowers. Smiling with tears in their eyes. The fading remnants of flowers. Struggling with their last wilt. The unopened buds. Gradually being crushed to pieces. Endlessly embracing gray sorrow. Intoxicated in a miserable and desolate state. Oh. Sorrow is the brush. Tears are the tap water. One day they will wash away the impurities of people.</p>
<p>(2) The autumn sounds of the city. Weeping forever. People are still young. One by one, withered branches and leaves. Noisy clamor. Sighs of misery and anguish. Weak and feeble prosperity. Secret currents of water flowing, flowers wilting and falling. Constant natural disasters. Turning fertile land into wasteland. The result of war. Where is there not dried bones and blood. Foreign aggression stirs up gray sorrow. Even more panicky and fearful. Oh. Sorrow is a landmine. Rage is the detonation of a landmine. One day it will sweep away the tribulations of people.</p>

<p>New Voice (1380) 6:00 to 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Mei Fei"</p>
<p>The wind and rain are in harmony, celebrating peace. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, I, the lonely one, love beauty and am captivated by beauty. The concubines in the harem are without color. Only Mei Fei is outstanding in both talent and appearance. Her eyebrows are like willow leaves. Her hair is like clouds. Her face is beautiful like a flower and the moon. The romantic emperor accepts the grace. Morning and evening under the moon and before the flowers. It is truly said that the affection is as deep as the sea. Who knew that the woman named Yang would flatter and deceive. A newly selected beauty entered the palace. Competing for favor, she is jealous. She is skilled at bewitching the supreme one. From then on, the sounds of flutes and drums were noisy in the separate courtyard. Here, it is desolate and lonely in the courtyard. Autumn water wears through, but the horse does not come. Loving the new and forgetting the old. Men have always been ungrateful. The fan is discarded before the autumn wind rises. Crying ruined the hearts of many beauties in the world. Mei Fei is alone, missing and sad. Only the candle has a heart to shed tears until dawn. Before long, the barbarian rebels ascended the golden palace. All for that hundred-charming Yang Guifei. The storm and rain urge them tightly. The beauty broke her soul. Only leaving that fragrant bone buried in the plum forest in desolation.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 11:45 PM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Small Feast in the Red Chamber" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>Daiyu's charm is undiminished. Her spirit gradually returns to its former state. The golden hairpin does not loosen the hair. The silk robe is loose and thin. Baoyu secretly peeks first. Then he gently comforts her. The autumn colors of the painting screen are beautiful. The smoke of the medicine dregs fights for new poetry. Look at this. The wonderful window casts a natural picture. The autumn light of the silver candle is a wonderful word. If you deliberately lie alone on the bed. I'm afraid you will be laughed at by Chang'e. Sister Yingchun smiled. Saying that life is to be enjoyed in time. Order Zizjuan to arrange a small feast immediately. The sisters are not hesitant to sit. The wooden spoon sends the golden cup full. Writing and painting is effortless. Baoyu is punished with the golden cup. His white face is already flushed. Leaning on the railing, try to look at the moon in the sky. There is no defect at all, a great time. The cold dew sprinkles on the flower branches.</p>

<p>"By the Huangpu River" is a drama written about the local scenery of Shanghai. It has now been edited. It has been test-screened once. The actors' performances, recording, and photography all have special achievements.</p>
<p>Tao Jin plays a young man in "Yangliu Village". It is another tough performance, which is similar to the rickshaw puller in "By the Huangpu River" in different ways.</p>
<p>Little Star Li Songyun appeared on camera in "Yangliu Village".</p>
<p>Tang Jie has recovered from his foot injury and went to the company today to film "Yangliu Village".</p>
<p>Wen Yimin's "Female Student" script has been approved and is being rehearsed diligently every day and will soon begin filming.</p>
<p>After more than a month of hard work, Zuo Ming has completed the re-examination script of "Mr. Wang's Way of Making Money" and sent it to Beijing for review today.</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng has not filmed for more than a year since "Mother". Recently, she performed in "Yangliu Village", playing a pure woman of the new era.</p>
<p>Tianyi Company specially recommends newcomers Chen Qixia, Tao Jin and Leng Bo. Their acting skills in "By the Huangpu River" are very exquisite. Seeing the same old faces on the Chinese silver screen is really a bit annoying, so Tianyi's efforts to recommend newcomers this time is indeed a pleasing thing.</p>
<p>"Night Meeting" scene Xie Jun and Yuan Shaomei</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Bundle of Telecommunications <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>In the era of silent films, the film "Ramona" starring Doris Deleio once caused a sensation far and wide. Now, 20th Century Fox has made the story into a sound film, with Loretta Young playing the role of Ramona. The film is all in color, making it even more beautiful and lovely. It is said that the film has arrived in Shanghai and will soon be released at the Daguang Cinema.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen Guotai's recently released "Spring Fatigue by the Green Window" cannot help but praise the new star Simone Simon extremely. Her new work after "Green Window Spring Fatigue" is Ladies in Love, which at first glance is another film describing women's love, and co-starring with her are Jenny Gaynor, Loretta Young and Constance Bennett.</p>
<p>The war epic "The Story of Louis Pasteur", starring Frederic March, Warner Baxter, and Leon Rimaux, has been playing to full houses since it was simultaneously released in the Da Guangming and Guotai theaters. It is said that it is indeed one of the best works among the war films in recent years.</p>
<p>Tan Ying and Zhao Dan have achieved amazing success in their acting in "Little Lingzi". The most lovely thing about the film is that the dialogue is witty and the performance is relaxed, with a great Western film flavor. Therefore, all friends who have seen "Little Lingzi" at Jincheng are very satisfied and unanimously praised it as a masterpiece of domestic films.</p>
