<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>那天飛機在南京明故宮飛行塲略停一刻，飽餐了頓「外國點心一——的二十多桶的汽油，然後又「軋軋軋」地高唱起「萬里壯行」的歌，昻首騰空而起，向西奮翮挺進了。</p>
<p>此次同在九霄遨遊的乘客中，有一位行將履新的貴州省委何輯五氏，當中國航空公司於民十九創辦之初，他任首任總經理，在航空業可以稱「老行家」，在該公司更可稱爲　創辦人。他說：「中航公司初賣客票時，很少有人敢買敢乘。第一月的營業收入，僅八千元；第二年他離職他就時，剛增收至十倍的八萬元。今則已增至二十萬餘元，而新航綫還逐步在延長中。由此可見國人對航空交通的認識進步，以及航空公司營業的發展。」我想歐亞航空公司的情形，大概也與此相近罷。</p>
<p>一般說來，乘飛機想得到安全，廳備有（一）成人之美的氣候；（二）機構完美的飛機；（三）技術純鍊的駕駛員這三個條件。假若（一）（二）兩條件已具備，飛至半途，氣候突然惡化，遇着暴風烏雲，如何飛過難關，這就要全靠駕駛員的技術和修養了。駕駛員當飛行時，因要兼籌並顧所駕飛機升降，速率，氣候，方向，油量諸事，所以眼耳手足以及全部筋骨神經都要總動員，而且還要歷久不懈。如滬昆（明）綫的第一日飛行，由上海到成都，須工作八小時之久，眞不是一件平凡人所能勝任的事。</p>
<p>現代科學進步，各國屢有新發明，對人類幸福貢獻旣大，而鼓勵科學家的興趣也不少。據說一般研究航空學者，對於現用飛行機的機構，還不斷的在研究改進中。譬如飛機的起落，需要寬大的飛行塲」不經濟，也不方便。所以有人在研究改進它，想使它能由斜平綫的起落，改進成較垂直的上下。或者更設法能伸縮其翼，陸空兩用自如。果爾，則私人有三五畝園地，也好自備一架飛機玩玩了。這雖然還是理想，安知將來不會成爲事實？</p>
<p>記者剛除去塞在耳朶裏的棉花（因不耐機聲喧擾，故須用棉塞耳），和同行們談得非常有趣的時候，只覺機身半傾，斜着兩翼飛了個圓圈，便落在地上，才知到了河南鄭州的五里堡飛行塲了。據隨機飛行的電信機械管理員黃厥昌君說：「鄭州氣侯，常有變化，以前將到站的廿分鐘問的飛航，多少總要搖幌幾下；今天遇天陰、在江蘇境內是天晴，）反平穩如此，眞好極了！」下機步行，見塲草已衰黃不堪，以與上海龍華的靑草塲相較，無異從溫帶到寒帶了。但沿途所見平原田埜，與蘇境差不多。晨七時由北平起飛的南下機，已先十分到站，上蓋布衣，隔兩日始復北飛。</p>
<p>飛機又飽吃了一大餐汽油，數之得四十七空桶；後到西安，又飽餐一頓。福大量大如此，無怪能負重致遠，日飛萬里毫無倦容。只可惜它所吃的只有西餐，而無國貨，利源外溢，猶屬其次，若遇非常之時，外人不肯供給如此大量西餐，大力士一旦不能「枵腹從公」，恐不免要暗被老牛車冷笑哩！可知航空救國，固是當務之急，而汽油救國，也是刻不容緩的。巾國油礦，頂好的要算撫順田的：但現在「那鳥已經飛往別人籠裏」，只好退求其决，積極開發陝北和嘉峪關兩處了，希望政府提倡於先，實業家努力於後吧！</p>
<p>從鄭州西飛的上空俯瞰，黃河一綫蜿蜓於下；首陽山和華山起伏嵯峨於南。豫陝邊境，有些低平的小山，上面周圍，都一圈圈的鑿滿了梯形耕地，而民居窰洞，便掘在那地垠之下，只見三三五五的黑洞，東西散居着。洞旁偶然立着幾株楓樹，確如古詩所謂：霜葉紅於二月花」一樣地紅，不用說，這已點綴成一幅秋意蕭瑟，動人遐思的天然美圖了。以後連接看見幾個城市，街道都是方直的，民房也多是「四合頭」的，其集體與新式都市輻射式的建築，自然廻然不同；可是一種嚴整方正的特色，由上面看着也非常引人注意一。尤其是洛陽和長安，誰不說是古香古色，僅足以供憑吊的舊都？但現在都已漸漸回復着靑春了！譬如洛陽自分設中央軍校以後，一切都已革去了舊觀；特別是蔣委員長近日駐節於此，更形成政治中心之所在。城裏和西宮的新建築，以及新造的林木，雖在秋風凜冽中，仍可依稀見其欣欣向榮之槪。又長安自定爲西京以後，年來努力建設，成續突飛猛晋，而人口亦已增至二十餘萬（據建廳長雷寶氏談，固定人口有二十萬，另有活動戶口約五萬），前途將日趨繁華，這是更可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>逃避一片雲霧，飛機好像要擦着華山的肩角似的，沿着山腰低飛了一段，那位電務員黃厥昌君來問我們說：「到西安要吃中餐抑西餐？好電吿站上代爲　備。」不多一會，卽午後一時，果然到了西安。</p>
<p>是日無意中碰着幾位朋友，一位是前在靑海見過的譚時欽氏，他在南京站送友人上機，一位是台灣志士（現入國籍）謝××，從前在一二八泥戰時見過幾次，現在他却和幾位同志來西北考察；一位是在九一八前瀋陽認識的現任新運總幹事閣玉衡氏，在西京招待所剛看好房間轉面碰着。他們都是遠在數千里外，和數年之前認識，而今又會於風靡中偶然碰頭，人事變遷，眞是莫明其妙。</p>

<h3 id="c41">美國在西太平洋增防之意義 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>維持太平洋均勢的華盛頓海軍條約及倫敦海軍條約。在本年年底滿期。太平洋英美日三國的軍備競爭。業已開始。據華盛頓軍事當局最近的宣佈。美國想在中途島同威克島上面。建築空軍根據地。這樣一來。美國向西太平洋發展的最前線。將由夏威夷羣島向前推進了一千海哩以上。感覺靈敏的日本海軍當局。非常不安。美國的計畫。在國防上在外交上。都有很重要的意義。不過在目前外交的意義。似乎比國防的意義。更重要些。</p>
<p>美國的太平洋防務最大弱點。便是軍事根據地太少。菲列賓同夏威夷中間數千海里的海面。美國沒有什麽重要的防禦地方。如果美國的敵國侵襲菲列賓。則駐在夏威夷的海軍空軍。一定有『遠水救不得近火』的困難。幸而近年航空事業發達。給美國以軍事上的便利。飛機的速度。使海面的距離縮短。而美國的假想敵人。最恐懼的是飛機的襲擊。現在從舊金山到香港的橫貫太平洋定期航空。業已實現。西太平洋洋面。時見美國飛機的影子了。商用飛機是隨時可以改成軍用的。如果威克島同中途島的空軍根據地完成。美國的防守菲列賓及在遠東海面作戰的計畫。有更大的成功把握了。</p>
<p>可是美國這個計畫。是因爲日本宣吿華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約之死刑而引起的。目前美國的外交方針。便是如何以各種壓力。使日本接受一點華盛頓各種條約約原則。一九三六年海軍新約。日本不肯參加。華盛頓九國公約的義務。日本不肯遵守。所以只有用大海軍大空軍政策。以促日本之覺悟。最近史汀生前國務卿著遠東之危機一書。對於日本之片面違反九國公約。抨擊芸力。他說美國在一九二二年答應日本。不再在西太平洋一帶。增設軍事根據地。爲的是日本願意遵守九國公約。尊重中國之主權與獨立及維持對華門戶開放之原則。現在日本破壞中國主權及違反門戶開放原則。美國自然沒有在太平洋不設防禦的義務了。史汀生先生更說。因爲美國在西太平洋不設防。及依照日本的海軍力而裁减海軍。故九一八一二八時候。沒有勇氣對日本做更切實的表示。絃外之音。可想而見。</p>
<p>我們始終希望太平洋諸强國。在一九二二年條約的精神下。再求和平。遠東集體安全之維持。勝於任何軍備競爭與商務競爭。日本方面。應該覺悟美國這種計畫。動機在於外交。假使弄假成眞。對於日本帝國。明顯的是很不利。空軍的發展。已使日本在西太平洋優勢的海軍軍港及潛水艇。减少其作用。何况美國同英國的遠東航空綫已經在香港連接起來。如果在南中國海方面。美國可借用香港新加坡等根據地。在西太平洋方面。美國有威克島中途島及關島等根據地。日本海空軍將受到大包圍。要恢復一九二二年以後的安全。是十分困難的。</p>
<p>目前的軍備競爭或者只算外交上一種積極的表示。不過一九三六年只餘一個多月的時間了。無條約狀態下的太平洋。有什麽趨向與結果。十分明顯。太平洋西岸主人的中國。不能僅僅袖手旁觀。應該積極奮發。以圖生存之最後掙扎了。</p>

<p>兆豐路虹口女科醫院醫生張文華及其姘婦陳大寳（即梁梅玉）、因於本年九月四號、將打胎女子陸愛麗·男子兪根生·用繩勒斃、埋尸地下、案發被匯山捕房破獲解送第一特院、訊明判决張處死刑、陳處無期徒刑、但張文華奉判不服、業已延兪恩良律師撰狀、向高二分院</p>
<p>提起上訴</p>
<p>各情已誌本報、茲悉女犯陳小寳亦奉判不服、延請李仲文律師撰狀、向高二分院聲明上訴、　上訴之理由、略謂、本案第一審判决、處上訴人陳小寳以共同罪責、其所根據者、不外當殺人時、上訴人曾經在塲參與一點、夫在楊爲一事、而參與又爲一事、對於在塲之一點、爲上訴人所不否認、而對於參與之一點、則事實旣</p>
<p>不足證明</p>
<p>而張文華又未將上訴人攀入、是則此點實大有硏究之價値、查張文華之供辭、雖前後略有出入、而其當時實際之經過、則大概可以推定之、死者兪·陸·二人至虹口產科醫院要求打胎、張文華施用手術不愼、將陸之子宮剪破、流血人腹、因而致死、恐兪姓聲張、騙其抽血置於死地、其政死之緣因、係抽血</p>
<p>漏入空氣</p>
<p>抑係打重劑之麻藥針、則張文華供辭前後兩歧、但要共致死之主要緣因、則不外打針、查虹口產科醫院、係張文華個人所主　、上訴人僅居於看護之地位、對於醫藥智識、可稱完全不懂不過於施用手術時、從旁傳遞應用物件、對張所施之手術、旣無過問之權、又無參贊之能力、張文華爲陸打胎、</p>
<p>手術差誤</p>
<p>當然爲上訴人事前之所不能知悉、故陸之死、死於施用手術不愼、兪之死、死於張文傘之陰謀、第一審加以始終參與一語、未免武斷、至於兪·陸·二人、究係打胎而死、及打針而死、抑係勒斃、則醫藥上不難斷定、蓋活人被勒死及死後被勒頸、情形判然不同也、况以法理而論、犯罪之緣因、應取中要之緣因爲準、本案陸之</p>
<p>子宮已破</p>
<p>萬無生理兪被打重量之毒藥針、亦絕無生望、則用毛巾勒頸之一層事實卽使有之、不能加重甚罪、無之亦不能减輕其責、與兪陸之致死、實無因果之關係也、退一步言、卽使打胎肇禍以後、張果有將擬謀殺兪姓之事、事先對上訴人說明、當時上訴人身爲人妾、完全處於其勢力範圍之下、目係女流、智識薄弱、驟然得悉、</p>
<p>大禍臨頭</p>
<p>當然失却理智及判斷能力、惟有百事順從、此其地位關係使然、他人處之、亦必如是、何能獨責一智識淺薄之女流如上訴人者、故量情度勢、上訴人之處境、實爲萬分不得已、責以柔弱無斷則可、而謂爲有共同之故意、則未免不諒、至於事後</p>
<p>湮滅尸跡</p>
<p>之種種行爲、則　逼處此、無可如何、吿發其本夫、爲人情之所不能、不湮滅、尸體、又將如何、且不論心術而專論行爲、亦不過事後帮助、至多負帮助犯之罪責、乃第一審逕將上訴人以共犯論斷、於法于情、似均過當、爲此請求廢棄原判、更爲合法之釗决云云、</p>

<p>本市社會局長潘公展氏、於本月九日應市立體育專門學校之邀請、赴該校出席總理紀念週講演、講題爲「體育和衛生敎育的關係」、原文如下、</p>
<p>各位先生、各位同學、今天本人在此地參加市立體專總理紀念週、可以說、是創校第一次到校和各位說話、同時看見學校裏面的情形精神很好、那是很愉快的事、</p>
<p>我們市政府在吳市長領導之下、對於國民體育方面—尤其是靑年都一致起來提偶鼓勵、今年我國代表團參加世運的成績、因爲體力不能給人家抗衡、以致各項運動都落後很遠、大家感覺到非常慚愧、同時又以爲這麽一個大國、如果一般國民的體格增進、在國際體育競賽當中、自然不會佔不了一個位置、因此市長就發了一個宏願、要創辦一所上海市市立體專學校、意思是要拿牠辦到到一間國內比較完善的理想中的體育學校、去培植體育人材、去訓練體育的師資、用以推動和促進國內一般體育的發達、這棟設校的根本意思、各位一定是早已明瞭的了、</p>
<p>我今天要說的、就是體育和衛生敎育的關係、</p>
<p>我們提倡體育、不單是着眼在運動、會中比賽成續的進步、根本要使到一般人體力增進壽命延長、庶幾擔常些較繁重的工作、並且可以多做些事體、爲整個國家民族謀幸福如其先注意在選手成績這一點、那麼充其量祇養成了極少數的選手、大多數的國民、仍舊是沒有健全的體魄、對於整個民族、有什麼助力、何况國民一般的體格够不上水準、要想有出如拔萃的選手、可和別國爭短畏、也是夢想、本國目前的情形、就是一般國民的體力、比不上人家、因此、擔當工作的人、比人家少、才弄成一個「東亞病夫」的狀態、在這樣國難嚴重的當中、我們一個人應該要做可抵兩個人的事情、一天功夫應該做可抵兩天的事情、要達到此目的、必須大家提倡體育、希望着全民族的各個份子、都有健康的體質、去擔當非常時的工作、同時把體力的標準、如果能發達到國際的水平綫以上、那麼在競爭當中、也自然可以爭得相當的位置、毋須强求的、</p>
<p>平常我總有一種感覺、認爲體育是衛生敎育、——就是健康敎育——之一部、體育和衛生、實實在在是不可分離的、</p>
<p>說到體育方法和運動種類、本人全是門外漢、不過拿敎育的眼光看來、似乎有很多値得研究的地方、各位將來畢業、是要負資訓練中心學生的、就要從學生的體力氣質和個性分別去研究、不能死守呆板的方法、要知道體育的目的、是使人由不健康而健康、由多病而少病、如果方法不適合、而勉强的用呆板的方式去强逼施行、事實上有一種人固然可以得着相當的進步、而同時也許另有一種人因爲超過限度？不但不進步、而影響到身體上的健康、我希望從事體育的同志、一方面要從實地上去檢騐、一方面也要從研究上去用功、萬不要認爲各種方法和項目、總是「人有我有」、「人云亦云、而絲毫不肯去加以研究、市立體專應採取研究和試騐的態度、將運動的方式和器械、自己改良好的辦法就用、不好的就改良、以期試騐出一個適合全國需要的訓練體育方案、來加增進步的能率、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c180">讀「賽金花」劇本 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 楚陽</p>
<p>我喜歡看戲，不大歡喜讀劇本。「據一，最好讓它具體的形象的表現和活動在舞臺上，纔有趣有道理。雖然文學史塲也有旣有趣又有道理的劇本，永遠也不上演的。但據的成功與否，我想總應該由「演出的效果」來决定它的評價。這一評價，最好以對觀衆的影響與感應作依據。也許有人要反駁；文明戲很合某一些觀衆的口味，使他們喝采呌好，那文明戲的評價如何？其實文明戲對不論那一階層的觀衆的影響客觀地說來都是不好的。夏衍先生作的「賽金花」劇已上演了，爲了準備去看戲，我讀了一過道劇本。這據本我應該早讀的，它不是早已引起了戲劇界和文學界的熱烈評論了麼。</p>
<p>以歷史事件庚子拳亂作題村寫劇本是很値得的，「賽金花」這樣的人物本來就極其Dramatic的，拿她作主角也很够味兒。有人會經對此劇發過問：作者到底是以義和團事變爲中題呢？還是以賽金花個人爲主題呢？有人認爲他沒有把主題卉淸楚。我以爲此劇的主題旣不是前者也不是後者，看起來也不會好像有「兩個主題」。因爲以前者爲主題，不能不以義和團的歷史事象的發展爲中心，而表出其前因後果及其意義，主角不能落在賽金花「這班子裏的姑娘」身上，卽使她「這手是握過飛特麗皇后的手的」（原劇中語），又「和德國統帥瓦德西睡了一些時候」（魯迅語）；如以後者爲主題，劇中這個女子的悲劇沒有發展到極點，而穿挿和浮現了許多歷史上事件和人物。那末，此劇是社會史劇呢？還是個人悲劇呢？作者目己的解答是最恰當的：「諷喩史劇」。他是「描寫一幅以庚子事變爲後景的奴才羣像，從賽金花到魏邦賢，都想安置在被寫的焦點之內。」他是以反漢奸爲中心的。因爲他在一個北國的危城困居兩月，聽人講述三十七年前亂情景，聯想到當前狀况，「於是就想以摘露漢奸醜態，喚起大衆注意，『國境以內的國防』爲主題，將那些在這危城裏面活躍看的人們的面目，假託在庚子事變前後的人物裏面，而寫作一個諷喻性質的劇本。」（夏衍「給演出者的一封信」，發表於文學界創刊號。）這是作者自己表明的寫這一劇本的動機，雖然，此劇並沒有切合的以「國境以內的國防」爲主題但他確實是以庚子當年的那些漢奸的醜態與無恥的賣國行爲來諷喩面前的現實相的。那末此劇的主題，我們便可以確定爲：以歷史的諷喩反賣國的漢奸。我想，這樣纔沒有曲解作者、的意思？而此劇的「國防」意義也卽在此了。</p>
<p>最淺薄的曲解，是把賽金花看做一僩民族英雄，歷史上的偉大人物，愛國報國的志士，北京老百姓的大恩人。難怪魯迅先生的最後遺筆也沒有忘記諷剌一下：「作文已經有了「最中心的主題』：連義和拳時代和德國統帥瓦德西睡了一些時候的賽金花，也早已封爲九天護國娘娘了。」（見中流創刊號：「這也是生活」文內）魯迅先生是諷刺這些以賽金花爲「九天護國娘娘」的人，顯然沒有諷刺了作者，因爲作者「最中心的卞題」，並不在捧賽金花，而在反賣國賊。他並沒有將女主人公寫成一個「民族英雄」，他明白地寫出一個「以肉體博取敵人歡心而苟延性命於亂世」的女子，不過她較那些「高踞廟堂之上對同胞昂首怒目，對敵人屈膝蛇行的人物」，她　少的還保留着一些人性。因此他「祇想將她寫成一個當時乃至現在中國習見的包藏着一切女性所通有的弱點的平常女性。儘可能的眞實地描寫她的性格，希望寫成她祇是因爲偶然的機綠而在這悲劇的時代裏面串演了一個角色。」（引同前的夏衍的信）作者寄與她以同情，他的女主人公是不一定能了解的，老賽金花或者以送她十元錢的大師為同情她呢。</p>
<p>我們這樣來理解賽金花，並沒有减輕這位「一句話救了千千萬萬的性命」的「觀世音」！出現在歷史上的人物的意義，我們應該和劇作者一同把握他的主人公約眞實性（是不是不夠呢？或者誇張呢？）我們也不妨同情她，但决不是把她當做「九天護國娘娘」。像三十七年以前的北京老百姓一樣。我們應該把賽金花當做歷史的　喩的中心看。「在這種國家大變的時候，能够眞眞替百姓們講話的不是什麼大官大府，倒是這麼一個如花似玉的姑娘！」（原劇中語）這諷刺滿淸無能的官員够多惡呢！「中堂大人」都辦不了的事，却靠賽金花對洋人賣一點兒小面子，這盡了諷刺　術的能事了。</p>
<p>「賽金花」這劇本，却也不是沒有缺點的。我雖不懂得作劇法和戲劇技巧，我總覺得這劇的情節的發展和塲面的速貫都不大好，劇的塲面太散漫，劇的調子也欠統一，或者演成電影要好些，這要看演出成績如何　有定評了。共决是人物除主人公及二三人物（李鴻章，孫家鼎，魏邦暫）的個性凸現以外，其他的確都太漫畫化了（瓦特西也就是如此），演出時如導演得好，這一點是可以補充一些的。至於劇中所反映的「義和團」，祗寫了它壞的暴亂的一而，而忽視了當時中國人民的反帝的正義的情感的托出，這是作者對於歷史的眞實理解缺乏更深堪的識見和表現。整個地說：這劇的歷史意義雖不及「最初的歐羅巴之旗」和「怒吼吧中國」，諷刺意義也沒有像郭戈里的「巡按」一樣的美滿的充分貫穿全劇，但它仍不失爲中國劇作中的力作，在歷史劇和諷刺劇的意味上也都還是最初的收獲，關於它在國防戲劇上的應得相當評價，是無人能否認的。</p>

<h3 id="c182">讀由勤·沃尼爾戲曲雜寫 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>閏年，總統年，十一月，一九三六，富蘭克林·羅斯福櫃續被選民推上白宮無朝代而有期限的帝王；由勤。沃尼爾（Engene　OnEill也在同一月的稍後幾天，由諾貝獎金委員會贈給他以名利雙收的諾貝爾文學獎金。（這次諾貝爾獎金的贈給他，也許不是是和上二屆贈給「布寧」樣的理由，因爲沃尼爾能够保持美國的舊時作風」的原故吧。）十一月，一九三六年，對於容易　動的花旗人（或者更洋氣一些而更　遍地呌做楊基一人）是一個不尋常的一月，也是不尋常的一年，也許正在做學徒，楊基人的歷史家將來要寫的不尋常的一頁史實。就個人的愛好，皮膚不够白而同時也不够資格腰纏白萬可做美國寓公約我，就職業的立塲來評論，我寗願跛脚的羅斯福獲選，而不願銅臭傀儡的蘭登登台。但這可作爲新聞紙標題新聞紙材料的這件大事已經過去了。四年前，在選舉揭晚後，也曾爲這位跛脚的總統獲選而會澈夜做過文章，可是現在已無這樣興緻，也無這樣的需要，看了新聞紙的標題，　經滿足，而對於這位獲得諾貝爾獎金的美國人引以爲驕傲的戲據家，因爲對於他的戲劇有某部分的愛好而同時有一知半解的原故，在道國內，博學的文學權威，也許因爲時問來不及，也許因爲魯迅翁（願他畏安地下）所說，對於這一用力多而獲利少的工作」潔身遠去的前夕，權由我們這些「小兵來掛着帥印。</p>
<p>不是劇評家、不是劇作家，不是導演，不是伶人，更不是國內沃尼爾研究的權威，又沒有表演舞台術一些經騐，而只不過是肚子空空的職業文漢，（因爲自稱文人有些抬高身價）說些什麼呢？引些什麼呢？抄些什麼呢？眞是扳了石頭壓脚背」！可是許多管不了。且搜索枯腸吧。</p>
<p>遠在好多年前，在寄生蟲麕集的以販賣一折八扣的知識爲營業的所謂某最高學府，有些靑年聚在一起，從一個現在也成名戲劇家的同學那兒曉得了某敎授所吿訴他的美國近來爬上最高榮譽地位的戲劇家沃尼爾，並且同時曉得他的一個劇本呌做「瓊斯皇帝」。雖然不是讀的文科，可是文學的書却是有些貪饞，偷閒讀「瓊斯皇帝一，不料其中描寫黑人的美國土話，我的能力還不够讀得懂，卽是懂，至少要化去了很多的氣力，擺脫了吧，這樣的「王書」。等到後來，做了「打雜」的文字帮閒，有幾本美國雜誌可讀，有幾本文學書可供參考，美國評論家往往談的是沃尼爾，捧的是沃尼爾，引以爲驕傲是沃尼爾。我對於這位賦秉着愛爾蘭神秘氣氛而在佛洛德學說中打滾的美國文壇紅人開始注意。我從那些談的捧的引以爲驕傲的評論中，我曉得仙曾做過水手，他的好多劇本中，有着好多描寫海的美麗的塲面。小有產階層出身的所遺留給我的一些浪漫觀念形態，於是變爲海的夢幻者，水手的憧憬者，海盜的崇拜者，一海洋文學的熱烈愛好者。我愛史梯芬生，愛綠蒂，愛伊伯尼茲某部分的着作，愛康拉德的小說全部，（雖則在「大風」甲中國苦力常做野獸一樣看待，曾火胃起來把那本小說摔去，）同樣也愛好了沃尼爾。可是我雖做着夢，海的夢，我却不能如康拉德「明天那篇短篇小說中的角色靑年哈利」」一樣，永遠不「腐爛在一地　，也亚沒有當一世界就是我的家」，結果終於加沃尼爾「天外」一劇中的「羅伯脫·梅的」（Rober　Mayo），終日做着夢，指着天外，被美，遙遠而未知的美召喚，神往於迷魂的神秘，以求放浪形骸於廣漠的空間，而作汗漫遊，以追求那天外藏匿的秘密的歡快。（以上所引述的是根　允有成「天外」譯本），而結果呢，他却爲了獲得女子路史的戀愛，「和泥土結了婚」，在那「吝嗇」的泥土上工作，而短促了他的生命。這就是無情的現實，這也就是Philistine的不可企求而沒有勇氣的幻想。一個年靑的小伙子，也許有那波希米亞人的勇氣，一個年齡未大，世故未深的中年人，也許仍有着那波希米亞人的幻想，但一個老年人，除開偶然的例外，卽是這種幻想，也在生活的重擔中磨練完盡了。我從前在一個我所看輕的敎授家中，他似乎有意無意地暗示着我說：「小孩子，你不安份麼？你有種種理想麼？我告你，你一結了婚，你一上了年紀，你就會像羊一樣馴服。我認爲對那些搗動的靑年，最好的辦法，只要替他我一個對象。」我聽了他的話後，我記得曾面紅耳赤的力爭，結果弄得不歡而散。時間過去沒有幾年，我也並沒有老，事實吿訴我們是什麼呢？我在回味那位敎授的說話，而覺得悚然。這也許就是我所以讀沃尼爾的天外一劇本有些感動的原因吧。現在，那種波希米亞人的幻想，不要再讓其喪失吧。當一個沒有體騐一件事，或者熱切希望一件事的時候，也許那種感情的色味，是另外一種。我們和泥土結了婚的人，也許艷羨海的自由，而「馳舟如馬的舟子」，也許其中渴慕有和我們一樣的那種呆滯發了臭味的陸上家室。「明天」中的「老哈利做個水手，而對於水手，却十分厭惡，康拉德在他的類似自傳的小說「靑春」這一短篇中，也對於那海上生活，表露厭倦。讀沃尼爾的安娜克里斯蒂，那位作爲父親的「克里斯·克里斯托佛生」，憎恨水上生活，他討厭不斷海上艱苦的工作，他認爲到海上去求生活是不好的。他的家族中人，都是水手，他們的生活是什麼呢？只不過口袋中得着豐富的工資，吃了爛醉，被人搶掠，身無半文，然後再去航行。他們不歸家。他們沒有做一件好人所做的事。「那個老的魔鬼海」，終於有一天把他的家族中的人吞噬掉。於是他所希望他的女兒安娜，照他的理想，是有一天「嫁給一個美國東部的良善的安定的陸居的傢伙，有她自己的家，有幾個小孩子，而他也能做的外公，當他上岸的時候，每次都能去看他們。」（見氏著安哪克里斯蒂Publishedby　Boniand　Liverright　New　York）。這是一個老水手的想法，年靑的水手，也許可並不作安居陸地的幻夢。在沃尼爾另一戲劇「毛毛猿（the　Hairy　Ape）中，那位被稱爲毛毛猿的書中主角「楊開」（Yank）聽到他的伙伴的歌聲：</p>
<p>「在遙遠加拿大，</p>
<p>渡過了遙遠的海洋，</p>
<p>那兒有一個女郞她痴情的等着，</p>
<p>在替我組織一個家庭。」</p>
<p>於是，這位毛毛猿楊開先生極輕藐地發話道：「少放屁，你們這些下賤的混蟲！你們從那兒得到那個胡謅丫家庭，家庭，地獄！我來巷你們組織一個家庭！我要打死你們。家庭！呌家庭到地獄去！你們從那兒得到那個胡謅？這是家，明白麼？你們要家幹嗎？（驕傲地）我從我的家庭溜開當我是一個孩子。很高興得到勝利，那就是我。家庭對於我是責罰，總而言之。但你們不能和我賭你們的襯衫，你們沒有一個以後能奈何我。要不要試一試，你們任何一個。嚇，我揣你們不。（在一種比較妥恊的但仍寓輕藐的語調狀態下。（女郞等待你們。嚇？呀地獄！那都是胡謅。她們不等待任何人。她們向你們騙的是錢。他們都是淫婦，有什麼話反駁我麼？對待她們粗暴，那就是我。呌她們到地！獄去。淫婦，那就是這未會事，她們所有的一羣。」楊凱這位水手這樣的看輕女人，看輕家庭，海上什麼足以吸引他呢？也許如他的同伴柏迪（Paddy）所說：當船張開了「所有的帆，無數的日和夜。」「天空是燒着火樣的霞，繁星閃爍着眼睛」。有月亮的夜上，你看到船經過灰暗的夜，船的帆高張着，一切都佈散着銀白色，甲板上沒有一絲聲響，我們好多人做着夢，一直等，到你所在的船彷彿它完全不是一隻眞的船，而是一隻像飛行的荷蘭人一樣的鬼船，他們說那隻船永遠浮漂於海上而不靠海口」。而在日裏，「溫暖的太陽，晒在淸潔的甲板。太陽溫暖你的血，而從遙遠耀光碧綠的海洋上吹渦來的海風，像强烈的酒一樣接觸你的肺葉」這樣的海的吸引，也確足使我們這些腐爛在陸地，至多也不過蠕動的可憐生物，做着那海洋的夢</p>
<p>是的海洋是可留連的，海洋的夢，也會招致人去做的。一决，我聽到一個年紀同我相差不多的友人說他在做學生時代，想從那中國特有的死氣的家庭中逃出去，着了水手的衣服，戴了水手的白帽，往來於甲板上，遇着以海爲家的生活，我的心跳動了。這個話似乎是從我心底發出的。道種幻想，照我想來，大槪都是我們這樣少男少女所共同有的。我以前曾經讀到美國出版的北美雜誌」上一篇英國做海盜的大學生的故事，我非常神往。儒冠毀去，跳出這死人氣息充滿的文字阿鼻地獄，什麼還有比這更有浪漫的氣味呢？但是幻夢呀，早已隨西風的寒冷吹散。現在已不是我們做夢的時候了。這種夢，對於我們自己，我們的時代，也許有害的。借沃尼爾的話來說：『浪漫的幻想，它曾毀滅比疾病更多的生命。』（見其長劇SrangeInterude。）我們的時代，已不允許我們在做夢了。我們還有意義的事等待着我們去做。看：我們頭上頂的是千的重石：看，我們脚踏的是深淵般的陷坑；看，太平洋的水氾濫着血腥：看：無恥者以最無恥的手段奉送我們的鮮紅的血；看病在者以最病在的姿態在劃出我們的死路。看國際流氓以最陰險的計劃，最牢固的鎖練設圈套呌我們走入他的圈套；看鐵蹄沒有欄柵；看槍尖沒有欄柵；看飛機的橫行沒有欄柵；看；私貨的侵人，沒有欄柵；看毒物的輸入，沒有欄柵；看僞軍的內犯，沒有欄柵。浪漫的幻想，我要借用英國小說家Robcrt　Graves一本長篇小說的書名來代巷我說：「那些一切再會吧」。</p>
<h3 id="c183">銹跡斑爛的歷史名城，西安 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>西安，這銹跡斑爛的歷史名城，它實在是渾身都浸透了古意的。</p>
<p>譬如說，你一走出了大街，那迎頭刺着眼簾的不就是一座區分東西南北大街的，巨人一樣屹立着在那大道的中央的鐘樓嗎？這座巍峨的龐大的建築物，陪着那路北不上半里路遠的，和它一樣雄姿的鼓樓，相互遙對着蹲立在那裏，它們已是誇耀過好幾個世紀了。</p>
<p>於是，假如你是喜歡憑弔一下子，那麼，到處都够你去推考，到處你都得留連。一塊荒無的空地，是什麼王什麼侯的遺址，一方朽蝕得不成東西的碑板，是什麼才子什麼名人的筆蹟。那裏是杜甫巷，什麼地方又是秦王府。何處是銀安殿，何所又是御花園。一切的到處，到處的一切，都是彌滿了古的勝景，古的遺跡，情調，使你嘆氣，使你喘息，使你不勝今昔之感，古意濃厚的還會流下淚來！</p>
<p>於是，你轉了一個念頭：由憑弔過去而變爲觀覽現存。你到城南的那所華麗莊嚴的孔廟去。在那裏，你就好看到在西北稀有的千年的松柏，挺拔地植立在殿廡前面的空地上。還有那壁立着的巨大長方的石碑，那又是古來名貴的碑帖。繞了一番殿廡，你爬上丹墀，就可看見巍峨的正殿，那輝煌的琉璃，那碩大的庭柱，那華美的油飾，那潔凈的庭廊。當你念到：</p>
<p>「大成至聖孔子先師之位一的時候那怕你是西洋上帝的兒女們，看了那種莊嚴　潔的意境，也不能不要默息起敬了。</p>
<p>灣到隔壁碑林去，那就更其是是「古哉林也」。據說那裏就蘊藏了我們幾千年來的民族文化的精華。也怪不得報上載今年政府里要决定花五萬塊錢去修整它了。</p>
<p>在那裏，什麼景緻是沒有的，有的是橫橫豎豎的，東一堆西一堆的，羅列着好幾萬塊大大小小的石碑。什麼魏碑漢字，唐太宗寫的，康熙乾隆寫的，歷朝皇帝阿貓阿狗的「御筆」都有。畫帖也不少（什麼吳道子的當然是更有了）。總之，那裏是不愧爲中國碎拓的泉源。外行的人（如筆者）走了進去固然是要溜看得頭昏眼花，就是在行的人到了裏面，也恐怕難免研究鑑賞得你要精疲力倦了。</p>
<p>你不能再走到歷中博物館（在現在省立圖書館內）去。進到那裏，更是道處堆滿了你平日未見未聞的古怪東西、幾塊破石板　攏了來，它就告訴你，這是唐代的六駿（註）。一個黑漆漆的，鄉下人當做燒其錢香燭的爐子，它就是遠距今代數千年的周鼎商彝。一個泥汚滿臉，斷手折脚的石菩薩，那便是晋魏的石刻。小而至於一個破碗也是　泰藍，一個瀝靑的銅片，是新莽的貨幣。攏在裏面的，就是磚瓦片耶穌什麽未央宮的　，阿房宮的囉。總之，這裏的一切的一切，什麼都是古舊的，一切都吿訴着你：古的年月，古的文明。你一進到那裏，就要不目覺地帶着了一身「古氣」出來。</p>
<p>走過了這些地方的，你，就不管你是不是會成了個風雅家，然而，總算你已受過「古」的洗禮了。於是，你走進古董店裏，將不會爲了一塊新出土的破瓦殘磚索價四五十元的事而大驚小怪。走進一間剿舖裏，看見壁上也懸着古字古書，几上也陳列着古鏡古瓶而覺得會不稱，不調和。</p>
<p>於是，從隨便的普通人家裏，不論是几上或坑間，壁間或椅上，你總能發現一二樣古的器皿，或古的玩具。也許，從一個極　黑的烟燈底下，會給你發現一個嘉靖的古盤出來。</p>
<p>於是，飛機雖然在滿天飛，汽車雖在滿街跑，或者你就反會暝想到上古的木牛流馬的悠閒風度來。你的耳朶也變「古」了，聽了一下西洋音樂，又會愛起秦腔來。口味也「古」了，會討厭起什麼大菜，時菜，而　起饝籌頭來：天剛扯亮兒，你就已坐在那　傳說藏有幾百年歷史的鍋頭的館子座上了。</p>
<p>於是，就在你的客寓裏，你的擺設雖有了立體傢俬，桌上高爾夫，收音機，還少不了古佛古瓶。風雅一點的，更缺不了秦磚漢瓦，魏碑晋拓了。</p>
<p>慢慢地，城廂的古意給你收羅盡了，於是你就可隨意走到郊外。</p>
<p>郊外也到處是古的，東，南，西，北，那一處不古氣葱瓏，古蹟密佈？</p>
<p>要登高嗎？遠點你可上華山，近點你可登終南。那裏是神仙的勝地，風景宜人。要觀水嗎？你可到關，察黃河，視消水。那裏又是天下有名的古用巨流。要瞻仰偉大的死人嗎？在中部有黃帝，咸陽有唐太宗，臨潼有秦皇。要洗浴和愛人盟心締誓嗎？你可帶着你的洋裝西施，或黃臉婆子，東出臨潼，華淸池畔，正是李三郞和阿環鶼鶼鶼鶼，風流千載的勝境名區。如果你們還多情點，就索性一雙手携手兒，到興平的馬鬼坡去，憑弔一下這千載美人的香消玉殞的葬地，那末，阿　地下英靈不味，也將感激如知了。</p>
<p>此外，如名震中外，在倫敦研的還出演過的「王寳釧」，古蹟却出在距西安不過十來里的「武家坡」。還有那灞陵川，如今不用說是河底朝天了，可是從前却是十里長亭餞別的詩人斷腸之地哩。還有那古畏安城的遺址，那遼闊雄壯的土壟，使人看後，會想到從前帝王之都的氣槪，偉大。還有那……還有那……總之，西安的名勝和古蹟，是寫不勝寫，玩不勝玩的。整個的西安，是給籠罩在「古」的氛圍中。所有的西安住民，也就完全給圈住在這氛圍里面了。</p>
<p>但究竟有點缺憾的是，能呼吸着並賞覽這古意的，却不是旣往創造了以及現在還在創造着古蹟的西安的人們自己，反而，只是一些和它完全無關係的人—於是，難怪古意的西安，近來也變得有些灰暗了。魯彥先生去年寫西安印象，還只寫到大烟和烏鴉而漏了「古意」，或者，也就是這個原因。</p>

<p>眞的，他是東方最偉大的作家。正像每個偉大的作家一樣，他也是個偉大的思想家。爲了中國人民的解放，他捧獻了他的全部的才能和知識。遺憾得很，日本人民還沒有這樣一個偉大而富於影響的作家作爲我們的代言人。我們的日本革命文學，應該向魯迅的文學遺產多多地學習。</p>

<p>……聞所未聞之膽質治淋方法能以界敏捷之手續迅偉之奇效　……博士論文震駭歐洲整個醫界幷提出淋病外治簡便法</p>
<p>花柳科的最大課題，應該是淋病了。淋病在以前，原沒有特效療法，這是醫界和非醫界所都熟知的事。惟其因了無特效療法，所以許多治療劑都逐個不停地演出。但這些製劑都不外以黃色素爲主成分，而黃色素的品質方面，又是那樣的粗劣，服後多有損害胃腸和刺戟腎臟的副作用；至于說到效用方面，黃色素不過只有利尿和消炎的功能罷了。</p>
<p>然而若經過特殊的手續，使黃色素成爲誘導體，則它可以無任何不良副作用，而有切實治病能力。這種特殊手續，即是和感應性蛋白體相配合；因爲黃色素若不侶合蛋白體，便不能免粗劣和副作用之弊，所謂相得益彰，正是這個意思。而蛋白體呢？它的效能說起來真是太大，而且學理高深，非萬言長文莫能盡。Boeteur淋病學博士及花柳專家奧迭梯芬氏早已說明了蛋白體有昂進全身及血球撲滅淋菌的偉力，如果蛋白體更配合膽質其治淋之效，尤其強大。現今流行于國際間的克淋特效藥『克淋儂』，其成分即係以蛋白體黃色素配合而成，並兼含大量之膽質中的Lipoid。不但能因誘導體的特殊黃色素有消除淋病尿道炎的效力，更因蛋白體有賦活全身細胞的良效，故男女淋病白帶，以及婦女受丈夫淋毒傳染之子宮糜爛，陰道潮腐等症，服『克淋儂』無不奏收全功，永遠斷根！而無復之虞。</p>
<p>而且因『克淋儂』內含膽質，能促組織再生，故尿道炎爛之粘膜，得迅復康健。茍參用外治洗滌方法，則淋病之治愈，更爲快速！原來淋病除婦女白帶可外用『卡而雪地』氏陰道片爲坐藥外，不論男女淋濁患者，並宜外用德國『抗淋水』And　Gonococci-Aqva洗滌尿道或陰部，即有清除局部膿濁之效果，而免晨起封口及放尿不暢之痛苦！</p>

<p>……青春機的手淫是生命的遊戲，　……性神經的衰弱是惡習的酬勞。</p>
<p>現代的青年最令人驚心怵目的現象，就是朝氣索然，病容滿面，我們不論遇到任何正在發育中的青年——仔細去考察他，都有手淫的惡癖，他們因爲沒有性教育，所以不知道此中危險，簡直以生命爲遊戲了。結果呢？不是性器官矮小，就是遺精，早洩，勃起力不全。自凟爲什麼有此不良的結果？則因爲青春腺在發育途中，很爲脆弱，好象正在待放的花蕾，若是一朝被暴風雨摧折，未有不半途黃落者。手淫之所以障礙發育，和性神經因而衰老，也正是如此。青春腺既一旦受傷，內分泌機能也即停止，所以各部得不到營養，病態就百出了。陰莖發育成爲畸形，如短小，彎曲。其遺精早洩和不能勃起，則因性神經屢次被手淫所刺戟，和得不到荷爾蒙的涵養而來的。所以根本的解決，宜促進內分泌機能的旺盛。</p>
<p>我在東京帝國大學醫科攻讀的時候，對於研究青年病也素感興趣。當時即知各國醫刊中所最賞用的治療，以服德國梅倫氏的「補體康」最有特效。德國Saalbeld性病醫院院長Ypsil　nti博士，曾用「補體康」治愈因手淫而來之發育不全及性神經衰弱的青年，達五千四百六十三人。共用去「補體康」計六七萬瓶，自博士將此成績披露於當地報紙後，德國朝野人士，大爲驚嘆，譽爲青年病的福星。未幾即風行全球。余自畢業返國後，以「補體康」治愈性神經衰弱者，亦不可勝數。惟遺精病者以兼服「耐而斯遺精片」爲效更速。</p>

<p>……撇開一切敷衍的治標方法從根本上解決肺病　……爲終年呻吟于痛苦中的癆病人找到一線光明</p>
<p>肺癆病在世界各國，向被視爲一種最神秘之病患，學者大多注重于遺傳素因，而彷徨無所措；自一千八百八十二年科克氏之研究後，始發見肺病之病原體爲結核菌，此爲醫學中之大發明，爲治療世界開一確切之基礎！此後後種療肺方法，固莫不以結核菌爲目標也！</p>
<p>近世療肺法之較有價值者，如結核素Tuberculin之應用，以及鈣劑之內服等是，然究其實效，結核素雖注射于患者體內，在血中亦不發生抵抗力，以抗滅癆菌。至於鈣劑療法，只有『相對的』功效，而無『絕對的』效能。蓋鈣劑雖能促成肺部病灶之結締組織堤防，實際殊難減除癆菌之活力作用也。</p>
<p>此等療法早經學者證明無確治肺病能力，惟自『虛脫療法』爲學者公認後，肺病患者雖至重篤時期，如高熱咯血等亦可全治。今日虛脫療法又應用于內服製劑上，加最新發明之『補肺拿爾』，已迭經肺癆專家證明其滅癆補肺之特效，服後確能退熱止咳，除痰止血，毫無流弊，如兼有盜汗失眠遺精等，宜同服『補體康』可也（女用『補女容』）余回國後業經治愈多人云。</p>

<p>……鉛華早褪美人興遲暮之悲，　……病魔……的爲患。</p>
<p>女性的青春，本較男性短促，她的月經初次來潮，就是女子青春的到臨。大概到了二十四五，韶華半已消逝，這就是美人遲暮的到臨。不過若是青春腺健全和旺盛的女子，她往往維持青春到三十歲以外，到四十歲左右，她們依然有少女般的丯姿。不過大多女子都因了月經病，及神經衰弱的關係，往往到了二十歲左右，已有青春不屬她的了之感呢！</p>
<p>原來女性青春的盛衰，完全由卵巢支配的。卵巢機能健全，則月經通順，身心愉快，丯姿婥約，卵巢失常，月經困難，新陳代謝機能停滯，故血流障礙，所以呈貧血狀態，而脂肪消減，肌肉鬆弛，遂成爲一個可怕的夜又。要挽轉青春，先須調整月經，旺盛新陳代謝機能。以內服「補女容」功效最著，因爲牠能調整卵巢機能，強腦補血，所以月經病既可治愈，而頭痛失眠，心悸健忘等神經衰弱也可治愈。同時肌肉充實，面貌豐腴。自然儀態萬分，青春常駐。至於患有白帶病的，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以掃除白帶。此爲余從陸軍醫科大學畢業後屢所治騐之事。</p>

<p>如何應付絕孕之淋病</p>
<p>淋病本爲生殖部分之症狀，故最易毀滅生殖機能。而尤以輸精管炎爲最易絕孕。蓋淋毒一旦侵入輸精管，此管即因發炎而閉塞，遂不能負輸精責任，成爲不孕之主因。又幸而未閉塞，因與異性接觸，此精液與淋菌，由房事時注射陰道，而發生劇烈之　炎，或子宮炎。由子宮內侵而成喇叭管炎及卵巢炎。則男性雖不致絕孕，而女性則有絕孕之危險矣。故對於此症，不可不深思熟慮，使其不致發生。不幸發生，亦當妥爲醫治，俾免絕孕之危險。最安全之治療，宜內外兼顧，始爲萬全之法，同時妻子之淋病，亦須治療，庶免輾轉傳染，而致前功盡棄也。下例乃治愈後而仍恢復生殖力者。</p>

<p>— 我</p>
<p>我對於近日中日談判一事，曾經一再說明，假定一面儘管談判，一面不斷的受匪偽的侵略，此種談判，非但無效，適墮匪僞的詭計，不如立卽停止判之爲愈，我對於綏邊匪禍，也會貢獻過一些意見，謂剿匪計劃，不僅在給養方面，我國人當源源接濟，而在實力方面，我國當局也應儘量援助，此種事理，顯然明白，原不必有識者方能預料及之也。</p>
<p>現在綏邊事件，已發生至嚴重化，戰事正在激戰中，據十七日太原電，我前方將士，正在冰天雪窖中，奮勇抵抗，屢挫敵鋒，我們前敵勇敢的將士們，能抱此最大的决心，不惜任何犧牲，以爭取民族的半存，保全國家的領土，此種精神，天然値得我們欽佩，至於後方物質上的供給，我們全國人民，正在一致起來，作援綏運動，若實力上之援助，我國軍事當局，必早計及，原不必我輩再來過慮。</p>
<p>我茲所欲言者，對於勦匪的戰略方而，更應常詳愼的考慮，據我國古來的兵家者言，攻守之勢旣殊，勞逸之情各別，戰爭的事，似乎守者易而攻者難，攻者勞而守者逸，此種說法，原是以雙方的實力相等者而言，現在科學機械戰爭時代，則未便固執是說，現在匪軍攻綏，利用飛機大砲掩護，我方若無些二者，或有之而力量未能相等，則守禦方面，無論如何，必難支持，徒有犧牲，而難於克敵，坐守危城，無補事實，此不可者一也。</p>
<p>其决，兵法曰，先發者制人，後發則爲人所制，現在綏邊的悄形，處處爲入所制，但用應戰之法以禦之，旣非長著，幷且敵方集其重兵於一處，我們無論如何抵抗，總是吃力多而成功少，我們應當變更戰略，出犄角之師以分其力量，用聲東繫西之法以亂其視聽，然後大敵可除，幷且匪僞軍之侵佔我土地，已屬不少，不於此時作整個的解决，更待何時，决不能再泥於人不犯我我不犯</p>

<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>寓居的前面，是一所舊式房屋。春間間有一根藤爬到屋瓦上了。夏天，開了小小的白花，初秋，就結了果，兩個「葫蘆」</p>
<p>葫蘆花鏡載：一名瓠瓜，正二月下種生苗，引蔓而上，葉似冬瓜而稍圓，有柔毛，五六月開白花，結實初白，霜降後老而色黃。一種圓血大者，日飽。亦名孤，因共可以孚水如泡如泡如也。亦可作藏酒之器。一種下大上小，腰細口細者曰葫蘆。可盛丹藥，大可爲甕蓋，小可爲冠樽，小兒用以浮水，樂人用以作笙。</p>
<p>鄉下孩子小時候沒有頑過葫蘆的，大槪不很多罷。我小時，就很愛過葫蘆。不過這限於「下大上小，腰細口細」的一種。用朱漆索，掛在身上。後來，看得懂封神榜之類的神怪書，曉得仙人們都隨身帶有一個葫蘆，就越發愛好了。</p>
<p>至於「圓血大」的一種，我是從小就討厭的。討厭牠，到不是因爲他的本身，實在因爲討厭了那些光光的和尚的頭，葫蘆葫蘆頭，就述帶討厭這「圓　大」的一種瓠瓜了。</p>
<p>雖則我十分討厭，而家中還是每年種此「瓠瓜」。夏秋之間，小小的靑瓠瓜結在藤上了。我就偸偸地用尖鐵釘，一個一個弄破。只存太高的弄不着，就讓他長成。</p>
<p>冬天，米缸裏和水缸裏的瓢，全不能用了。母親就呌入採下這長成的幾個瓠瓜來。細細的剖開，弄去子和　，來代替那些破了的。但我當時，並不因爲他有用而不討厭，有時候，背着母親，把米缸水缸裏的瓠，放在地下，用力的踏碎牠。</p>
<p>記不得幾歲了了。表哥來我家玩。帶來了一個「葫蘆」做的笙，嗚嗚的吹着。我看見非常歡喜，不過，沒有向他討，因爲我知道，就是討也沒用的。晚來，故意挨得很遲很遲睡，央着僕人，把表哥的葫蘆笙拿給我吹，吹了很久，吹不嚮，於是我大發脾氣，覺得這葫蘆也欺人，就一脚踏碎了。</p>
<p>踏碎之後，我是十分的惶恐。恐怕表哥忽然想起他的葫蘆來。然而奇怪，他竟不再想起，而我却偸偸地把自己的葫蘆都藏起了，恐怕他看見血想起自己的一個。</p>
<p>從此，我也不再頑葫蘆。</p>
<p>年齡稍大，我就追悔起少時候的破壞瓠瓜的故事來。但已經不及了。</p>
<p>莊子逍遙游，惠子謂莊子曰：魏王貽我大瓠之種，我樹之而實干石水，盛水漿，其緊不能自舉也，剖之以爲瓢，則瓠落無所容，非不　然大也，吾爲其無用而掊之」。莊子曰：「夫人固拙於用人矣……今子有王石之瓠，何不慮以爲大樽而浮於江湖，憂其瓠落而無所容，則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫！」</p>
<p>這自然是寓言，但我却眞的第一次，感到了瓠之大用。凡是有機會看到瓠時，總是沉思好久。</p>
<p>自然，自己是猶有蓬之心也夫！雖則因爲瓠之大用而沉思，而對於瓠瓜的樣子，仍舊不能不縐眉。</p>
<p>夷堅支志「趙公衡，宗室，居秀州。性易和，善與人欵曲，但天資滑稽，遇可啟顏一笑，衝口輙發，見者無不敬畏，因寡髮，俗目爲「趙葫蘆」拱景廬作减字木蘭云，「家門希差，養得一枝依樣畫；百事無能，只去籬邊纏倒籐，幾回水上，軋捺百翻眞個强；無處容他，只好炎天晒作巴。」則覺得葫廬頭之可笑者，决不止我一人，我在這裏，就拿他聊以解嘲了。</p>

<p>三囝利用老闆娘呌他到學校裏接小老闆的機會，偸偸地踅進了前面的弄堂口。他提心吊膽地先向四週張望了一下，纔在賽鐵口的拆字攤橫頭坐了下來，並且小心地從內衣袋內摸出了三張折疊得爛縐了的信紙，一隻信封。——這東西是他在半個月以前就在店裏偷了出來，一直寳貴地藏着，可是直到今天才得了機會，讓這些紙張重見了天日。</p>
<p>賽鐵口擡起老光眼鏡，向他的主顧充分打量了一下，才接收了三囝的信紙信封，並且攤開了，用墨匣鎭壓着。</p>
<p>「你說罷！寫給誰？寫什麼？……賽鐵口疊着紙，磨着墨，在嘴裏咬着筆尖，這樣問着三囝。</p>
<p>一寫給……」三囝囁嚅地說着，張望着四週。一寫給我的阿婆，先生！你給我吿訴她，我在上海，在黃金龍的烟紙店裏。我天沒亮就起來——眞正是天還沒有亮，比阿婆在鄉下起身的辰光還要早，是洪全把我推醒的。那個夥計的洪全，是比我早在店裏做生意的那個夥計。先生！你給我吿訴她，我很晩很晚睡覺，所以我一天到晚打瞌睡……</p>
<p>「沒有得睡，最苦哩，先生」。</p>
<p>「十月初」，已經好幾天了，你給我吿訴她，先生。我打脫老闆娘一隻酒瓶，是一隻不值錢的瓶，就像陳大爺家裏擺在灶角上的醬油瓶一樣的一隻瓶。因爲早上起來太早，我一時糊塗把牠失手打碎了。老闆娘要我賠，我沒有錢賠還她，出來時阿婆給我的兩百錢已經用光了。所以我吃了老闆娘兩記耳光，是用着力的兩記。……</p>
<p>「我哭了好許多辰光，我想阿婆。」</p>
<p>「阿婆給我的兩百錢，我用光了。我沒有把她瞎化，我實在沒有辦法。拱全，就是那個店裏的夥計，他知道了我有兩白錢，他要我請他客，否則他不肯敎我怎樣做事情，所以我請了他八個銅板花生米。還有一决，小老闆要我買糖給他吃，否則他要吿訴老闆娘打我。還剩下四個銅板，我買了一隻老雄鷄，那是用泥做的，吹起來會呌的，現在我藏着，一點也沒有弄壞，我回家來的時候帶給小弟弟，</p>
<p>「　你　我　　　　　　　　　　又給老闆娘打了兩記耳光，損了一下頭。我痛得很，現在還在痛。但這不是我的不好，因爲師父呌我搬一包草紙，我沒有聽見老闆娘在樓上呌我。</p>
<p>「請你吿訴我的阿婆，先生！請她不要擔心，老闆娘不打我，我就好了！</p>
<p>「請你吿訴我的阿婆，先生！我很想阿婆，我爲了想阿婆，我常常流眼淚。請阿婆放心，我再不頑皮了。以後我句句聽從阿婆的話，我不再使阿婆受氣了！</p>
<p>一我再回到阿婆身邊就好了！先生，請你給我告訴她，我完全不像從前那樣頑皮了！我想阿婆哩！……</p>
<p>「……唔！還有！先生！還有一個陀螺，我出來時放在我的床底下的木箱裏。就給弟弟了吧。我現在不要這個了</p>
<p>賽鐵口開始在信紙上寫着「祖母大人膝下。敬稟者」。九個字，筆啣在嘴沒有寫下去，兩眼不住地端相着他的主顧。</p>
<p>「那麼這封信寫到那裏呢」？</p>
<p>「寫道鄉下。在陳街鎭西市梢，陳大爺轉交給阿婆。」</p>
<p>「那裏的鄉下哩？」</p>
<p>「就在鄉下。那裏呌陳家鎭，陳大爺很出名的，他就住在張家宅東面，那個大宅子裏。這信就交給我的阿婆，那個燒火的施阿婆，或則說三囝的阿婆，他們不會弄錯的……」</p>
<p>「信上不能這樣寫的呀」！賽鐵口反給他弄得狼狽了。</p>
<p>「就這樣寫罷，先生！不會弄錯的，先生你給我吿訴我的阿婆，先生，我想她哩」！</p>

<p>— 藍佩</p>
<p>傍昏時候，我再甲板上看落日。幾隻隨船的徒寫翱翔在船的四近，牠們那單純挈厚的語言添了畫意詩情的黃昏自然無限生氣。</p>
<p>我這才知道「美」的感人——遠及於各種生物。誰能說鳥們不是在愛起黃昏來了呢？</p>
<p>看哪！在落日絇燦的海面上，在黃昏綺麗的晚霞間——在淸風吹送起海底私語的詩境裏：翱翔着十幾隻熱情的鳥們！誰歌詠得出這首詩呢？</p>
<p>一天——發生了一齣悲劇。</p>
<p>也許是由於西天落天奇麗的引誘。也許是……——有一隻鳥遠遠地離了羣飛向日落的地方去了。猶如一支箭，猶如一陣風，牠飛得那們快！</p>
<p>我們都躭憂起來了，牠怎麼回來呢？</p>
<p>然而，牲回來了。疲憊地急亂地撲着翅膀翩扎回來。</p>
<p>——回來了呀——</p>
<p>在同情的懽呼聲裏，可是——牠到底支撑不件了。牠顯得那麽衰弱，突地，幾乎掉到海面上去了。牠在海面上竭力掙扎地低飛着。海浪撥起浪花，潤濕了牠的胸部——腹部。牠一度二度掙扎着——起來，終於：力竭了！讓一顆浪花帶進了深深的海底！</p>
<p>我們默默地向海面注視了瞬。一種說不出的滋味滲透了心頭。</p>
<p>夜雲，從水平綫上湧起來了。</p>

<p>開篇「林處士」</p>
<p>湖上孤山一角靑。梅花三百種成林。好一個，天懷澹遠林君復。竹　茅舍自甘心。不受塵埃半點侵。豈但好學未嘗求仕進。而且廿年足趾未臨城。梅是作妻小子鶴。可知鐵心傲骨本天成。天寒有鶴梅花守。彷彿萱實承歡還有母千情。梅頩頰。鶴鳴陰。一個是，姑射仙人工笑顰。一個是，輕淸雛鳳讀書聲。偶遊山寺佳賓至。他奚奴縱鳳入靑雲。只見對舞蹁躂把家主迎。先生是，小艇瓜皮歸路遠。勝陶家稚子候柴門。工書畫。愛詠吟。說我無須名世稿休存。然而疏影橫斜水淸淺。暗香浮動月黃昏。已經佳句傳流直到今。厥後君王頒粟帛。還易名和蜻號先生。高潔獨留身後名。說茂陵他日求遺稿。幸喜曾無封禪文。更可見，風流放浪早薄長卿。</p>

<p>熱血遍開自由花。落霞孤鶩歌平沙。滿江紅光射天赤。戰地鶯花錄勇話。好靑年醉臥沙塲內。販馬記起昔日差。想當初，啼笑姻緣生戀愛。一粒珠子做盟階。長生殿中度蜜月。釵頭鳳鳳起禍花。廣陵潮湧從　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　向西施策戰計拿。七義圖與大中華。</p>

<p>開篇「鶯鶯琴心」</p>
<p>香蓮碧水動風凉。水動風凉夏日長。長日夏。碧蓮香。鶯鶯小姐喚紅娘。與你香閨閒無事。後園中消悶散心腸。紅娘聽。意洋洋。隨千金移步下樓房。轉灣曲折身向內。竹屛風穿過木香棚。行至白梅亭上站。則見森森遮太陽。好一個伶俐小紅娘。急忙推開四面窗。桌兒擺中央。瑤琴去了囊。寳鼎爐中焚了香。千金坐下按工仩。先彈一曲湘妃怨。又彈一曲鳳求凰。數曲瑤琴方已畢。見金烏漸漸落西方。紅娘忙碌亂。閉上四面窗。瑤琴掛在墻。寳鼎爐中熄烟香。雙雙主婢轉閨房。打從原路行前去。小橋曲折映池塘。見池中戲宿兩鴛鴦。丫頭吓。早日夏凉風動水。水動風凉夏日凉。固然美景不尋常。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Pseudo-Army Vigorously Attacked Xingtao on Three Routes Yesterday; Extremely Dense Shelling with Multiple Planes Assisting the Attack; Our Troops Fought to the Death to Resist, and the Battle Has Not Ceased; Our Troops Achieved a Great Victory in Counterattacking the Honggeertu Area; It Is Reported That Zuo Yi Convened a Military Conference in Jining <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram, on the morning of the 19th at 7:00 AM, the pseudo-army, with Bao Yueqing's cavalry as the left wing, Wang Ying's infantry as the front, and Li Shouxin's forces as the right wing, totaling over 3,000 troops, launched a fierce attack on Xinghe, Taolin, Tuchengzi, and Nanhaoqian. The shelling was extremely dense, and seven bombers assisted in the attack, providing aerial cover. At around 8:00 AM, two more fighter planes were added, concentrating fire on the right flank of our Dongjia Village defense line. Our troops, Zhao Chengshou's department, and the local militia fought to the death to resist, and the battle had not ceased by noon. The bandits advanced one after another, leaving corpses strewn across the fields. The defending troops of Xinghe also opened to KOUBU KOUKOU, to reinforce the area, and fierce fighting is predicted for the afternoon. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram, at 2:00 PM on the 18th, our troops shot down a bandit bomber at Nanhaoqian. It did not land but caught fire and was destroyed in the air. Currently, our anti-aircraft artillery is extremely powerful. When bandit planes come to drop bombs, they are at an altitude of 4,000 feet, making it difficult to accurately hit the target. Our troops are less threatened from the air and can calmly kill the enemy. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram, the pseudo-army has scheduled a general attack for the morning of the 20th, and a major battle is imminent. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guihua) After our army's great victory in Honggeertu, Cavalry Division Commander Peng Yubin and Infantry Brigade Commander Dong Qiwu returned from the front to Pingdiquan on the 19th. It is said that on the 19th, Fu Zuoyi convened a military conference in Pingdiquan, gathering important military officers such as Zhao, Peng, and Dong, to jointly discuss strategies for annihilating the bandits. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guihua) At 6:00 AM on the 19th, Zhang Wanqing commanded bandits and pseudo-forces from Nanhaoqian and Daqinggou to fiercely attack the Xinghe and Fengzhen positions, but they were defeated by our Sui forces. In addition, seven planes flew from Dolun to Suidong on the afternoon of the 18th for reconnaissance and returned in the evening to Shangdu, where the bandit troops of Li Zhenming and Hu Yushan are stationed. On the 19th, the two units went to Honggeertu to reinforce, with a total of twenty heavy artillery pieces and more than sixty machine guns. It is said that the pseudo-bandits currently have over 150 tons of guns and ammunition, stored in Zhangbei and Shangdu, and another forty cases of incendiary bombs are stored in Shangdu. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Our troops have achieved great victories in Honggeertu for several days. On the morning of the 18th, they attacked and occupied Banqi Village, destroyed the pseudo-army headquarters, and killed countless enemies. On the 19th, the bandits planned to reinforce with two pseudo-bandit divisions, attempting to once again invade Honggeertu. Our troops' morale is high, and they are advancing bravely. The local Mongolian people are happy to act as guides, and the Mongolian troops under Daming Sulin have agreed to contribute. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The bandits have suffered setbacks in their repeated attacks on Honggeertu. On the 19th, they planned to reinforce with the pseudo 5th and 8th Divisions, attempting to invade again. On the Xinghe front, over 200 bandits on horseback attacked Tuchengzi at 11:00 AM on the 18th. At 4:00 PM, they were repelled by our defense forces, who captured one pseudo-platoon leader and eleven soldiers. In addition, over 1,000 bandits, accompanied by several armored vehicles, attacked Xinghe from Nanhaoqian on the 19th, but were repelled by our troops. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The bandit army in the Taolin and Honggeertu areas has repeatedly harassed our side. After fierce counterattacks by our troops, they have now retreated in defeat. The bandit army of Bao Yueqing is currently detouring towards Suibei. Several bandit planes flew to Xinghe for reconnaissance this morning. The bandit and pseudo armies are currently planning a large-scale invasion of Suidong, Suixi, and Suibei on three routes. Roughly, Li Shouxin and Wang Ying will harass the Xinghe area, Jin Jiashan will attack Taolin, and Bao Yueqing will advance to Suibei. They are currently deploying and preparing, and a major battle is not far off. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Situation, a urgent telegram stated that the bandits invading Honggeertu and the border area of Taolin had been repeatedly struck hard by our troops, and their momentum was somewhat diminished. Since yesterday, many bandit units, including Li Shouxin and Wang Ying, have been transferred to the front line, planning a large-scale invasion of Xinghe to Taolin. Only Jin Jiashan's unit was left to support the remnants on the border of Honggeertu. Yesterday, planes bombed several times, but due to our solid fortifications, there were no major losses. As of dawn today, both sides are still in a stalemate. People from Suiyuan said that in recent days, our troops have bravely frustrated the bandits. Although the bandit units claim to be 6,000 strong, they are mostly a rabble and not to be feared. However, the planes come from time to time to bomb, acting as henchmen for the enemy. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram, the cavalry of Peng's division of our Honggetu garrison searched for traces of bandits in the Tiger Mountain area near the position starting in the afternoon of the 18th. The remnants of the enemy in Dalacun Tuchengzi are still resisting stubbornly. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram, the pseudo-army in Bailingmiao has completed its assembly. The bandit crowd claims to be 50,000, but in reality, it is less than half that number. Zeng Yan'yi is scheduled to arrive at KOUKOU on the 20th to deploy defenses. Our army's fortifications in that area are very solid, and communication with the rear is also convenient. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengshou jointly telegraphed Yan on the 19th, announcing victory, stating that Peng's cavalry division engaged in fierce fighting with bandits in the Tuchengzi area on the 18th, killing over a hundred bandits and capturing military supplies such as bandit vehicles, radio equipment, and horse-drawn carriages. Wang Ying fled in defeat. We suffered five wounded company and platoon leaders and over ten soldiers. Our side's morale is extremely high and we will surely annihilate the bandits in the short term. (19th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Pingdiquan: The Chinese army won a victory in counterattacking the bandit army in Honggeertu yesterday. It is said that the Suiyuan army, with the help of newly arrived animal-powered transport units and some artillery units from the rear, fiercely counterattacked the bandit positions. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits fled eastward. The Chinese side claimed that 300 bandit corpses were recovered after the battle, and several cars, donkey carts, a radio telegraph machine, and a batch of baggage were seized.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese newspapers here are carrying news of Sino-Japanese negotiations in a distinctly pessimistic tone. All newspapers are trying to give everyone the impression that China's attitude is now firm and strong, not only resolutely rejecting Japan's proposals on anti-communism and North China, but also unwilling to express points that have already been agreed to. In addition, China pointed out that the bandit troubles in Suidong were instigated by Japan. It is said that the attitude of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is quite indignant, but it will continue to work hard to require China to recognize in principle the proposals on North China and anti-communism, and to obtain a clear compromise on the resolution of various so-called pending cases, and to thoroughly resolve other incidents such as Chengdu and Beihai. Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, had a short meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in the afternoon of the 18th. At that time, Ambassador Xu clarified our government's attitude, but Foreign Minister Arita did not respond. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Song Zheyuan Discusses His Inspection Tour; He Had a Day-Long Meeting with Han Fuqu; The Situation in Suidong, Although Tense, is Not Worth Worrying About <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan met with reporters on the morning of the 19th and said that during this inspection tour, he passed through counties such as Gu'an, Renqiu, Hejian, and Nangong, inspected the stationed troops along the way, and inspected the administration of officials, cleaned up pending cases of banditry and drugs, and gave instructions on the policy direction of various counties. The autumn harvest in the whole province is still good, and the banditry has been suppressed, so the order is peaceful. When he was in Nangong, Chairman Han happened to be inspecting northern Shandong and arrived in Dezhou. Because they were very close, they had a day-long talk. He also told Han frankly about the general situation of Hebei and Chahar. Han gave a very detailed account of the situation of his visit to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing. In addition, there was also a general discussion on national affairs. Hebei and Shandong are adjacent to each other, and their situation is roughly the same. They should be on guard outside and appease inside under the overall national policy. Han completely agrees with this point. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 18th, Han went east, and he also returned north. Because of the treasure problem, the various departments of the 29th Army will be redeployed. Although the situation in Suidong is tense, Chahar Province is still safe. The bandits who are attacking Sui are not worth worrying about. Because Inner Mongolia is cold and lacks food, it is very difficult in military terms, and the number of bandits is at most only ten thousand or so. With a rabble, it is difficult to last, so I hope that the people of the country will be calm. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Song Zheyuan received visitors today, he expressed the opinion that the situation in Suiyuan would not turn serious because Japan did not admit any relationship with this incident. Therefore, the Chinese authorities can regard the invaders as bandits and disperse them. Song mentioned the meeting with Han Fuqu in Nangong on the 17th of this month, saying that they had discussed the situation in North China at that time for a long time. He said that Hebei and Shandong are adjacent, so they should help each other in the same boat and maintain law and order based on the principle of appeasing others internally and externally. The two completely agreed on this. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) In order to develop the economy of North China, the Xingzhong Company planned to issue 20 million yuan in corporate bonds because there were no results in domestic fundraising, and wanted to invest in the Jingxing Mine. The Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin did not agree with this, and the two sides were in dispute. The Sui-KOU incident occurred, affecting the Japanese military headquarters' plan for economic investment in North China. Recently, except for navigation, everything has been at a standstill. Although Li Sihao has returned north, the contact with Staff Officer Ikeda is still indefinite. The attitude of the Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin is now indifferent and will reorganize the steps after the Sui incident unfolds.

<p>(Tianjin) In a certain Tianjin concession, a frustrated former Zhili-Lu warlord planned to take advantage of the situation in Suiyuan-Eastern to disrupt public order. The authorities sent out many investigators. On the night of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, several accomplices were arrested in a certain inn in Hebei. The rest are being searched for. Cheng Guorui, the former Zhili-Lu army commander, and Wang Huchen, the pseudo-chief of staff, have secretly gone to the Xingtai and Lixian areas, attempting to gather old Zhili-Lu bandits and launch an uprising. The authorities have dispatched secret agents to follow them. According to officials in Tianjin, Cheng has been struggling in Changchun in recent years, lacking food and clothing, and no one in the puppet regime pays attention to him. Now he wants to find a way out in the political and military circles of North China, so he makes empty threats to intimidate the authorities. The defense within the Hebei-Chahar border is tight, and he will not be allowed to succeed. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Baoding) After reorganization, the Jingxing Coal Mine's 14th business year ended at the end of September, with a profit of 880,000, more than four times the previous years. The average daily output of coal is now 3,000 tons. Due to lack of transportation, there are 100,000 tons of coal in stock, which cannot be sold. If it cannot be transported out in another ten days, part of the work must be stopped, and at least 2,000 workers will lose their jobs. Director Gu Zhongxi is scheduled to attend Feng Zhi'an's inauguration ceremony on the 20th, then go to Beiping to meet with Song Zheyuan, asking him to find a way to allocate vehicles from the Beining Railway to help. According to Gu, the mine has built a wide-gauge railway, which will connect with the Zhengtai Railway at the end of December. Large hoists will be used and installed in January next year, trial operations will begin in February, and implementation will begin in March. It is estimated that the daily coal output can be increased to 5,000 tons. At the current coal price, the net sale is 4.3 yuan, and the estimated profit for the next year can reach more than 1 million. The Cixian mine has started construction and will be able to produce coal next month. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Flying from Shanghai to Xijing (Continued) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>That day, the plane briefly stopped at Nanjing Ming Palace Airfield, having a hearty "foreign snack"—more than twenty barrels of gasoline. Then, it once again "chugged, chugged, chugged" and sang the song of "A Grand Journey of Ten Thousand Miles," raising its head and soaring into the sky, bravely advancing westward.</p>
<p>Among the passengers traveling in the sky this time was He Jiwu, who was about to take office as a member of the Guizhou Provincial Committee. When the China National Aviation Corporation was first founded in 1930, he served as its first general manager. In the aviation industry, he can be called an "old hand," and in the company, he can be called the founder. He said, "When China National Aviation Corporation first sold tickets, few people dared to buy them and ride. The first month's operating income was only 8,000 yuan; when he left the job the second year, it had just increased tenfold to 80,000 yuan. Now it has increased to more than 200,000 yuan, and new routes are still being extended gradually. This shows the progress of the Chinese people's understanding of air transportation and the development of the airline's business." I think the situation of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation is probably similar.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, to obtain safety when taking an airplane, one must have (1) a climate that helps success; (2) an aircraft with perfect mechanics; and (3) a pilot with pure skill. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, but the weather suddenly deteriorates halfway, encountering a storm and dark clouds, how to fly through the difficult situation will depend entirely on the pilot's skills and training. When a pilot is flying, because he has to take into account the airplane's ascent, descent, speed, climate, direction, and fuel level, his eyes, ears, hands, feet, and all his muscles, bones, and nerves must be mobilized, and he must persist without懈. For example, the first day of flying on the Shanghai-Kunming (Ming) line, from Shanghai to Chengdu, requires eight hours of work, which is really not something that an ordinary person can handle.</p>
<p>With the progress of modern science, various countries have repeatedly made new inventions, which have not only greatly contributed to human happiness but also encouraged the interest of scientists. It is said that aviation scholars are constantly researching and improving the mechanics of existing aircraft. For example, the takeoff and landing of airplanes requires large airfields, which is uneconomical and inconvenient. Therefore, some people are researching and improving it, wanting to change it from taking off and landing on a diagonal plane to a more vertical up and down. Or, they may even find a way to make the wings retractable, so that they can be used freely on land and in the air. If so, then a private individual with three to five acres of land can also prepare an airplane to play with. Although this is still an ideal, who knows if it will not become a reality in the future?</p>
<p>Just as the reporter removed the cotton stuffed in his ears (because he could not stand the noise of the engine, he had to use cotton to plug his ears) and was having a very interesting conversation with his companions, he only felt the fuselage tilt slightly, flying a circle with its wings at an angle, and then landed on the ground. Only then did he realize that he had arrived at the Wulibao Airfield in Zhengzhou, Henan. According to Huang Juechang, the telecommunications mechanic manager who was flying with the plane, "The climate in Zhengzhou is constantly changing. In the past, the flight would always sway a few times twenty minutes before arriving at the station; today, the sky is cloudy, (it was sunny in Jiangsu Province,) but it is so stable, it's really great!" Getting off the plane and walking, I saw that the grass in the airfield was withered and unbearable, compared with the green grass airfield in Longhua, Shanghai, it was like going from a temperate zone to a frigid zone. But the plains and fields seen along the way were similar to those in Jiangsu Province. The southbound plane that took off from Beiping at 7 a.m. had arrived ten minutes earlier and was covered with cloth, and would fly back north in two days.</p>
<p>The plane ate another big meal of gasoline, counted to be forty-seven empty barrels; after arriving in Xi'an, it ate another big meal. With such a large capacity, it is no wonder that it can carry heavy loads and travel far, flying ten thousand miles a day without showing any fatigue. It is a pity that it only eats Western food, and there are no domestic goods. The outflow of profits is secondary. If in an emergency, foreigners refuse to provide such a large amount of Western food, the strong man will not be able to "serve the public hungry", and he may not be able to avoid being sneered at by old oxcarts! It can be seen that saving the country through aviation is a matter of urgency, and saving the country through gasoline is also a matter of urgent importance. The best oil field in China is the Fushun field: but now "that bird has flown into someone else's cage", so we can only retreat and actively develop the two places of northern Shaanxi and Jiayuguan. It is hoped that the government will promote it first, and the industrialists will work hard later!</p>
<p>Looking down from the sky flying west from Zhengzhou, the Yellow River meanders below; Shouyang Mountain and Mount Hua rise and undulate to the south. On the border between Henan and Shaanxi, there are some low, flat hills, on the top of which are terraced fields chiseled full of circles, and the dwellings and cave dwellings are dug under the edge of the ground, only seeing scattered black holes in threes and fives, scattered east and west. Occasionally, a few maple trees stand beside the caves, which are indeed as the ancient poem says: "Frost leaves are redder than February flowers," needless to say, this has been embellished into a natural beautiful picture of autumnal desolation, evoking reverie. Later, I saw several cities in a row, the streets were all straight, and the houses were mostly "quadrangle courtyards". Their collective and new-style urban radial architecture were naturally very different; but a kind of strict and square feature was also very noticeable when looking from above. Especially Luoyang and Chang'an, who wouldn't say that they are old capitals with ancient charm, only enough to be used for mourning? But now they are gradually returning to youth! For example, since Luoyang established the Central Military Academy, everything has changed its old appearance; especially since Chairman Chiang has recently been stationed here, it has formed the center of politics. The new buildings in the city and the West Palace, as well as the newly built trees, can still be vaguely seen in the midst of the chilling autumn wind. Since Chang'an was designated as Xijing, it has worked hard on construction in recent years, and its achievements have made great progress, and its population has also increased to more than 200,000 (according to Lei Bao, the head of the Construction Department, the fixed population is 200,000, and there are about 50,000 mobile residents). It is even more imaginable that the future will become more prosperous.</p>
<p>Escaping a patch of clouds and fog, the plane seemed to be wiping against the shoulder of Mount Hua, flying low along the mountainside for a while. The telecommunications worker Huang Juechang came to ask us, "Do you want to eat Chinese or Western food in Xi'an? I'll telegraph the station to prepare it for you." Not long after, at 1 p.m., we arrived in Xi'an.</p>
<p>That day, I unintentionally ran into several friends. One was Tan Shiqin, whom I had seen in Qinghai before. He was sending a friend off on a plane at Nanjing Station. One was Xie ××, a patriot from Taiwan (now naturalized), whom I had seen several times during the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Now he and several comrades came to the Northwest for investigation. One was Ge Yuheng, the current director-general of the New Life Movement, whom I had known in Shenyang before the September 18th Incident. I had just seen a good room in the Xijing Guest House and turned around and ran into him. They were all thousands of miles away, and I had known them several years ago, and now we met by chance in the middle of the war. The changes in personnel are really inexplicable.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Significance of America's Increased Defense in the Western Pacific <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, which maintained the balance of power in the Pacific, will expire at the end of this year. The arms race among the United States, Great Britain, and Japan in the Pacific has already begun. According to recent announcements by Washington military authorities, the United States intends to build air force bases on Midway Island and Wake Island. This would advance the United States' westernmost frontier in the Western Pacific by more than a thousand nautical miles from the Hawaiian Islands. The sensitive Japanese naval authorities are very uneasy. The American plan has very important implications for national defense and diplomacy. However, at present, the diplomatic significance seems to be more important than the defense significance.</p>
<p>The biggest weakness of American Pacific defenses is the lack of military bases. In the thousands of nautical miles of ocean between the Philippines and Hawaii, the United States does not have any important defensive positions. If an enemy of the United States were to attack the Philippines, the navy and air force stationed in Hawaii would certainly face the difficulty of "distant water not quenching immediate thirst." Fortunately, the development of aviation in recent years has provided military convenience to the United States. The speed of airplanes shortens the distance over the sea, and what the United States' hypothetical enemy fears most is air raids. Regular trans-Pacific flights from San Francisco to Hong Kong have already been realized. The shadow of American airplanes is often seen over the Western Pacific. Commercial airplanes can be converted into military ones at any time. If the air force bases on Wake Island and Midway Island are completed, the United States will have a greater chance of successfully defending the Philippines and conducting operations in the Far Eastern waters.</p>
<p>However, this American plan was triggered by Japan's declaration of the death of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. The current U.S. diplomatic policy is how to use various pressures to make Japan accept some of the principles of the various Washington treaties. Japan refuses to participate in the 1936 New Naval Treaty. Japan refuses to abide by the obligations of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the only option is to use a large navy and air force policy to awaken Japan. Recently, former Secretary of State Stimson's book, "The Crisis in the Far East," severely criticized Japan's unilateral violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. He said that the United States agreed to Japan in 1922 not to establish military bases in the Western Pacific because Japan was willing to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, respect China's sovereignty and independence, and maintain the open-door policy towards China. Now that Japan is destroying China's sovereignty and violating the open-door policy, the United States naturally has no obligation to remain undefended in the Pacific. Mr. Stimson further said that because the United States did not set up defenses in the Western Pacific and reduced its navy in accordance with Japan's naval power, it did not have the courage to make more concrete representations to Japan during the September 18th and January 28th incidents. The implication is self-evident.</p>
<p>We have always hoped that the great powers of the Pacific will seek peace again under the spirit of the 1922 treaty. Maintaining collective security in the Far East is better than any arms race or commercial competition. The Japanese side should realize that the motive for this American plan lies in diplomacy. If it becomes a reality, it is obviously very unfavorable to the Japanese Empire. The development of air power has reduced the role of Japan's superior naval ports and submarines in the Western Pacific. Moreover, the American and British Far East air routes have already been connected in Hong Kong. If the United States can borrow bases such as Hong Kong and Singapore in the South China Sea, and the United States has bases such as Wake Island, Midway Island, and Guam in the Western Pacific, the Japanese navy and air force will be surrounded. It is very difficult to restore the security after 1922.</p>
<p>The current arms race may only be a kind of active diplomatic expression. However, there is only a little over a month left in 1936. What will be the trend and result of the Pacific without a treaty is very obvious. China, the master of the western shore of the Pacific, cannot just stand by. It should actively strive for its final struggle for survival.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Content of the German-Japanese Alliance: Forming an Anti-Soviet Front; Germany Assists Japan in Reforming its Military <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, although both Tokyo and Berlin have remained silent regarding the rumored German-Japanese agreement, the North China Daily News has learned from reliable sources that its main features include a common anti-communist declaration and a signed treaty stipulating that Germany will sell war materials to Japan to enable it to reform its army within three or four years based on mechanization, and provide credit facilities to make this possible. Although Italy has been mentioned regarding the anti-communist front, it is said that although Italy is not involved in the political aspects of the agreement, it will endeavor to persuade Mussolini to join the joint anti-communist declaration in the future. It is heard that this declaration will clearly explain the seriousness of the harm of communism and that the West should unite to curb its spread, in view of the growing power of Soviet Russia in Europe and the Far East. The North China Daily News also learned that the military aspects of the agreement stipulate that Japan will purchase aircraft, tanks, and other war materials from Germany so that the Japanese army can be mechanized as soon as possible. It is said that after the recent large-scale exercises held by the Japanese army in Hokkaido, observers commented that the Japanese army showed weaknesses in mechanization. As a result, the Japanese military authorities formulated a reform program requiring 300 million yen. Germany now intends to shorten the Japanese reform program to three or four years, but this requires the assistance of Germany, because the Japanese deeply believe that Japan's domestic industry cannot meet this program and that there is still a huge surplus of military expenditures approved by the parliament that has not been absorbed by the military industry. It is heard that in order to help Japan purchase war materials, Germany plans to provide credit facilities for a period of six years, and the first payment will start from April next year.</p>

<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura, recently visited Foreign Minister Ciano today to discuss matters. Responsible figures here do not want to make any announcements about whether Italy will participate in the anti-communist front between Japan and Germany. Political figures only said that Italy is very interested in the anti-communist agreement currently being negotiated between Germany and Japan and is closely watching the progress of the negotiations, because Italy's views on communism are the same as those of Germany and Japan. The article on the anti-communist agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy published in the London Times this morning was only commented on by the "Tribune," which said, "We deeply regret this view of the Times and believe that the majority of British public opinion will condemn it." (According to the content of the Times article, see Reuter's telegram last night, (Havas telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(London) After the news of the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany and Japan came from Shanghai, rumors also arose in Europe. One rumor is that Italy may join this anti-communist alliance. Observers in Paris believe that Italy's attitude is quite cold. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was quite disappointed with the recent Italian-German meeting, because German leader Hitler believed that Italy's Central European plan was not yet mature, so he could not agree to it.

Mr. Chamberlain also said that Germany is now eager to maintain friendly relations with China because Germany sees China as a large market for its goods. He touched on this point during his conversation with the spokesperson of the German Embassy in Japan. The spokesperson told him that Germany did not want to be involved in any disputes in this part of the world. According to Mr. Chamberlain, if Germany and Japan sign a military alliance, it will unite China and Russia. However, when the problem of Chinese communism has not been resolved, China will, of course, still be cautious with Soviet Russia. Mr. Chamberlain does not want to deny that the relationship between Germany and Japan has developed very satisfactorily recently. Commerce between Germany and Japan has developed greatly as a result. Mr. Chamberlain also does not want to deny that the friendly relations between the two countries may give rise to a declaration of common unity, which may be brewing between the two countries now, but it is not a military alliance. When someone asked Mr. Zhang whether his denial that Germany and Japan had signed a treaty was based on information obtained from white people, Mr. Zhang replied that the Japanese authorities were extremely silent on the matter. The spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs only said that this was just a revival of old rumors. Mr. Zhang's remarks are not based entirely on information obtained in Tokyo in recent days. Mr. Zhang is familiar with Far Eastern affairs, so he makes his conclusions based on his extensive experience. Mr. Zhang also felt that the possibility of a serious conflict between Russia and Japan has been greatly reduced in recent months due to the resolution of the northern fisheries and oil rights. Mr. Zhang is now scheduled to leave for the south next Monday to visit the Philippines, Singapore, and Siam. Mr. Zhang worked as a journalist in Russia for many years and is the author of "The Russian Revolution." He recently changed his position to Tokyo correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor.</p>
<h3 id="e45">British Industries Federation Establishes China Committee to Study China's Needs and Promote British Trade <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British Industries Federation announced today the establishment of a special China Committee. The committee has a total of nine members, all of whom are experts in the Chinese market. The groups they represent include major engineering companies, the Federation of Diesel Engine Manufacturers, the Asiatic Petroleum Company, the British-American Tobacco Company, and Imperial Chemical Industries. The chairman is Sir McDonough, the current member of the London Committee of HSBC and the former president of the China Association. According to the secretary of the Federation, the reason for the establishment of the China Committee is partly due to Kirkpatrick's recent appointment as the representative of the Export Credit Guarantee Bureau in China. The Federation has seen that China's trade and finance have been greatly improved due to its currency reform and believes that the future is quite optimistic. However, the Federation believes that direct promotion by the government is necessary for greater effect. Therefore, it welcomes Mr. Kirkpatrick's appointment because he can provide valuable information on China's needs at any time. The task of the committee is to study China's needs and to enable British merchants to cooperate and provide various machines needed for a certain enterprise, such as a water plant. In addition to establishing a special China Committee, the Federation also gave various room equipment as a gift to the new house built by the Sino-British Cultural Association in Nanjing. Several other merchants also have gifts, including an electric clock and a radio. These gifts will be sent to China at the end of this month. (Reuter's telegram on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Responsible sources here indicated today that the United States may need to purchase some silver from London in the near future. This will probably be implemented after the full amount of silver purchased from China under the agreement has been reached. At that time, purchasing silver from London will also avoid disrupting the market, so the bulk of the silver will still be purchased from silver-producing countries.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member of parliament that the British government will continue to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty to protect the integrity of China's territory. "The government is very concerned about the provisions of the treaty.

<p>(New York) Two American "supreme salesmen" will be actively involved in major events in South America, one to sell the Good Neighbor Policy, and the other to seek the conclusion of reciprocal trade agreements. One of them is President Luo, who has already left Charleston on the 10,000-ton cruiser "Indianapolis" to attend the Pan-American Peace Conference that opens on December 1st in the capital of Argentina. The other is U.S. Secretary of State Hull, who is currently traveling from the capital of Brazil to Argentina. President Luo will widely sell his Good Neighbor Doctrine to replace the Monroe Doctrine, which is no longer applicable today. Hull will sell his reciprocal trade agreements. In addition to Argentina, President Luo will also visit the capitals of Brazil and Uruguay and will probably make small stops in other cities. The cruiser "Indianapolis" will be President Luo's "temporary White House" for the next month, and the cruiser "Chester" will accompany him. (Reuter's telegram on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Rome) After meeting overnight, the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party announced today that it will accelerate military preparations as soon as possible. The communique stated, "After listening to Prime Minister Mussolini's detailed report on the country's military preparations, the council believes that in the current special period, these preparations must be accelerated, especially the navy and air force." The communique also declared that Italy is determined to reach the highest point of economic self-sufficiency and pay special attention to national defense. It also stated that the results of Foreign Minister Ciano's visits to the capitals of Austria and Hungary have laid the foundation for cooperation between Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary, which is gratifying. In addition, a committee was established to draft various proposals for organizing a new parliament of fascist professional groups. Generally, this move is regarded as a prelude to the abolition of the House of Representatives. General Balbo also rushed from Libya to attend. (Reuter's telegram on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to the League of Nations' 1936 Armaments Yearbook statistics, countries around the world have spent more on military supplies such as munitions, warships, and aircraft than before. The total amount of world military expenditures in 1935 reached 5.4 billion yuan (calculated in 1933 US dollars, the same below), 4.9 billion yuan in 1934, and only 2.5 billion yuan in 1913. However, these statistics are not completely accurate because Germany keeps its military budget strictly secret. As for the world's navies, if the warships that have been built and those under construction are combined, they totaled 6.013 billion tons in 1935, and only 5.83 billion tons in 1934. The yearbook also stated that European countries are preparing for war in a hurry, and even train children to be soldiers. Italian children must receive compulsory military training from the age of eight until they enlist in the army. The period from eight to eighteen years old is the first period, and eighteen to twenty-one years old is the second period. After Austria violated the Treaty of Saint-Germain and established a conscription system, it also implemented military training in primary schools, middle schools, and agricultural schools. In Poland, all middle school students, high school students, and young people who do not attend school must receive military training. Within one year, 26,000 students and 133,000 non-students have undergone this training. Young people in Romania between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one must receive 50 days of military training every year. Other countries such as Sweden and Belgium also have voluntary training systems. (National Electricity on the 18th)</p>

<p>(London) Some people here believe that the Spanish National Army plans to blockade the port of Barcelona to prevent Soviet arms from being imported there, followed by the recognition of the National Army government by Italy and Germany, which may lead to a new and significant situation. (Reuter's telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The diplomatic corps recently met here, chaired by Chilean Ambassador Mogato. Diplomats from various countries believed that the Spanish civil war was so cruel that it made people feel that humanity was extinct and law and order was lost. For example, both sides indiscriminately bombed, causing innocent civilians to die in large numbers. We are on the scene and cannot remain silent. We should solemnly protest and express our deep hatred. (Havas telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Several aircraft of the National Army repeated the bombing of the city at 2:45 this morning, first dropping rockets and then throwing many bombs, most of which fell near the 17-story building of the telephone bureau. The sound of explosions was deafening. (Havas telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: National Army aircraft bombed the capital at 2:30 and 9:00 this morning, causing hundreds of casualties.

<p>Madrid: A Reuters special correspondent risked going out to inspect during a brief lull in the shelling and saw countless huge pits in the middle of the street, with broken walls and rubble everywhere. Some were still burning. Several large squares looked like scenes from war movies. He then went to visit friends on a certain street, but found that the whole family was dead. The situation has not changed today. The rebel side claims to have made progress in the northern district of the capital but has been heavily damaged by the fierce artillery fire of the defending army. According to the government's radio station, more than 40,000 fresh troops are coming to the capital to help in the war. The famous bullfighter Beipu, who is now an officer in the National Army, said while watching the night battle on the tower of General Farila's headquarters the other day, "We are just like Emperor Nero watching the Great Fire of Rome." This statement is very accurate because flames are soaring everywhere in the city of Madrid, and planes are dropping hundreds of fire umbrellas, descending slowly to facilitate bombers to choose their targets.

<p>(Berlin) Today, both Italy and Germany recognized the revolutionary government organized by General Franco as the official government of Spain. The German official announcement stated: "The government organized by General Franco controls the largest territory. Recent developments indicate that it will soon exercise power in other areas. The German government, in view of these facts, has decided to recognize it and has dispatched a chargé d'affaires to establish diplomatic relations. The new German chargé d'affaires will present his credentials to General Franco. The current German chargé d'affaires in Alicante will be recalled." It is reported that Rome has also issued a similar announcement. In addition, German propaganda officials confirmed that this joint action by Germany and Italy was anticipated due to the imminent fall of Madrid. However, they declined to comment on whether the purpose of this action was to prevent Soviet aid to the Spanish government forces. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to official sources, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, is now able to control a large part of Spanish territory. Germany's recognition is a natural step. However, as a member of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee, Germany's position as a signatory to the Non-Intervention Agreement will not be changed as a result. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Ministry officials recently stated that Germany's recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government was announced simultaneously with Italy because, during Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's recent visit to Germany, the two countries agreed to adopt a common policy against Bolshevism. The joint recognition of the Burgos government is based on this fact. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Both Germany and Italy have recognized the government organized by General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces. Once the Nationalist forces completely control Madrid, the government will move from Burgos to the capital. British observers were greatly surprised by this move, although they anticipated it eventually. They believed it would have been at the earliest only after the Nationalist forces occupied the entire city of Madrid. This place views the steps taken by the German and Italian governments as merely a formal expression of sympathy for General Franco, a sympathy that both countries have not concealed. Responsible circles in Britain believe that both Germany and Italy have made promises not to intervene in the Spanish Civil War and should abide by them. Therefore, the decisions of the two governments will not change the status of the Non-Intervention Agreement. As for the British government, it has no intention of abandoning its non-intervention policy. It is expected that in the near future, someone will ask the British government to state its attitude towards the Franco government. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government must continue to adhere to the Non-Intervention Agreement. Britain will vigorously oppose any attempt to release the obligations borne by the signatory countries of the Non-Intervention Agreement. As for the date of the next meeting of the Adjustment Committee, it is currently not determined. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French authorities expected that Italy and Germany would recognize the Spanish Nationalist government, but they did not expect the recognition to happen so quickly. According to political circles, the result of this move may be that the two countries will openly supply military equipment to the Spanish Nationalist forces and believe that their motive is partly to enable the Nationalist forces to search ships suspected of carrying military supplies without violating international law. However, France will not allow the Nationalist forces to have the right to search such ships because of this move by Germany and Italy and will take necessary measures in the Mediterranean to protect French ships and declare that France's policy on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War has not changed in any way. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Well-informed sources predict that the governments of Austria and Hungary will soon recognize the Spanish Nationalist government. During the recent meeting of the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Vienna, it was decided that after Italy recognizes the Nationalist government, Austria and Hungary should follow suit. Currently, the Austrian envoy to Spain has not yet presented his credentials to the Spanish Popular Front government, so it is very easy for Austria to withdraw its diplomatic representatives from Madrid.

<p>(London) The Spanish Nationalist government in Burgos has submitted a note regarding the blockade of the Port of Barcelona to the British government. Although officials refuse to express opinions, responsible persons believe that it must first be clarified whether the Spanish Nationalist forces have the power to blockade the eastern coast of the country. To have a blockade of a seaport recognized by other countries, it must be strict and effective. Furthermore, the British government previously notified the commanders of the government forces and Nationalist fleet when the Spanish Civil War</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Spanish Nationalist government decided to attack the Port of Barcelona and planned to blockade it, Foreign Minister Delbos and Navy Minister Gasnier met yesterday to discuss the measures that the French government should take. The Minister of National Defense, Daladier, did not participate at that time. Currently, there are no French merchant ships anchored in the Port of Barcelona. Outside the port, there are the cruiser "Gloire" and the destroyer "Albatross" patrolling. It is reported that the government will temporarily maintain these precautionary measures. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Marseille - It is reported that General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, has warned the British naval authorities that foreign ships may be in danger if military actions occur in the Spanish eastern coastal area, such as the ports of Tarragona, Valencia, Alicante, and Cartagena. The Nationalist forces are only prepared to guarantee the safety of foreign ships in designated areas for anchorage. Yesterday, Italian and German expatriates in Barcelona received warnings instructing them to leave. It is generally believed that from this warning, it can be seen that the Nationalist forces are eager to blockade the various seaports in eastern Spain. The Nationalist forces are likely to launch a general offensive by both sea and land routes. The Spanish government claims that the Nationalist cruiser "Canarias" is being driven by German officers and is being supplied with military equipment by Germany. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) According to the most recently published survey, the strength of the British Royal Air Force stationed in various domestic squadrons has greatly increased since May of last year. In May 1935, there were a total of fifty-three squadrons stationed in the country, possessing 580 first-line aircraft. Currently, the number of squadrons stationed in the country has increased to eighty, and the number of first-line aircraft has also expanded to 992. From the above figures, it can be seen that the progress of the British Air Force is rapid. The goal of one hundred and twenty-nine squadrons and one thousand seven hundred and fifty first-line aircraft is not difficult to achieve in a short period of time. The British Air Ministry plans to build fifty new aircraft fields, and thirty-nine are currently under construction. The locations of the various aircraft fields are mostly in the south and southeast of England. It is reported that the current balloon barrier has a considerable effect on the consolidation of London's air defense and has proven to be even more effective in cloudy weather, as it can make it difficult for fighter planes to track bombers.

<p>(Vienna) Foreign Minister Dr. Schmidt is now in Berlin to conclude an economic agreement with Germany to enable Austria to engage in large-scale rearmament. Dr. Schmidt's visit to Germany is the first official visit by an Austrian cabinet member to Germany in four years. It is generally believed that Dr. Schmidt's trip, accompanied by the German ambassador to Austria, von Papen, is particularly noteworthy. The proposed plan stipulates that Germany purchase Austria's surplus milk and timber, while Germany sells military aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery to Austria. So far, negotiations between the two countries have stalled due to Germany's excessively low prices for Austrian goods, such as offering only two pence per pound of butter. However, it is widely believed that Dr. Schmidt's mission to Germany is to try to remove obstacles to Austria's rearmament, as Austria is determined to do so. This is evidenced by the conscription that began in April of this year, the 6% increase in military spending, and the declaration of the right to rearm on November 12. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Rumors of Northern Chahar Bandits Spying on Sui, Su Yihe Leads Team to Defect, Various Bandit Mongol Troops Replace Red Armbands, Li Shouxin's Troops Set Out for Bailingmiao to Monitor <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Zhangbei correspondence: Various puppet bandit Mongol units in northern Chahar have recently moved west. The troops in Shangdu, Zhangbei, Guyuan, Jiabusi, and other places have mostly gone to the front lines. Only a few troops guarding the base camps and the families of various puppet bandit officers remain in various places. Li Shouxin was originally stationed in Zhangbei. Previously, because his troops were heading to the Shangdu front lines, all the family members of his troops were ordered to stay in Zhangbei. Since the various puppet bandit troops in Shangdu, under Li's command, attacked southwest on the 11th and 12th of this month, the families of foreigners and the families of various puppet bandit officers in Li's troops have successively retreated to Dolun.</p>
<p>General Offensive Imminent, Su Yihe Suddenly Defects</p>
<p>Regarding the date of the general offensive by the Chahar troops against Sui, various parties have differing opinions. According to people from Shangdu, the order for the general offensive against Sui by a certain party was issued to the various armies on the 13th of this month. It was decided to begin the general offensive on the 18th from Shangyi (Daqinggou) South Trench and Shangdu. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, Su Yihe (i.e., Su Meilong), the commander of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Brigade of Shi Linchuan, under Wang Ying's troops stationed in Bailingmiao, suddenly led more than a thousand righteous troops to defect in Bailingmiao, inflicting a major blow amidst the joyful voices of these puppet bandits. In order to prevent other units from rising up in defection, the bandit party specially dispatched Li Shouxin's troops from Shangdu to Bailingmiao. One brigade, which had stayed in Zhangbei, also rushed to Bailingmiao at night to monitor everything after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Certain Pro-Japanese Traitors Destroy Ping-Sui Bridges</p>
<p>Before the war started, the bandit party had already printed a large number of notices in Zhangbei County, planning to announce them to reassure the people after acquiring the five eastern counties of Sui. In addition, various tax bills and stamps were printed to exploit the people of Sui. They are currently preparing to transport them to Shangdu. It was recently heard that the bandit party intends to hire more than sixty plainclothes pro-Japanese traitors to destroy the Ping-Sui Railway bridges between Datong and Zhangjiakou to cut off transportation. It is currently being planned. Yesterday (the 14th) at 8:00 a.m., more than two hundred special troops from the bandit party stationed in Zhangbei set off for Shangdu. Furthermore, Li Shouxin, a certain brigade commander stationed in Zhangbei, frequently went to Bailingmiao yesterday and spoke to the local residents, saying that Suiyuan was quite difficult to attack. Currently, the troops are maintaining discipline as they pass through the area and have not disturbed the people. He fears that there will inevitably be some disturbances when the troops retreat in the future. It is unknown what his intention is. Previously, Li Shouxin attacked Sui, and his troops suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday, more than sixty wounded soldiers were transported from Shangdu.</p>
<p>Certain Party Aircraft Fly into Sui Territory for Reconnaissance from Time to Time</p>
<p>Since the 12th of this month, certain parties' aircraft have also participated in the war effort and have bombed the Sui army's positions and fly to eastern Sui for reconnaissance from time to time. Yesterday (the 14th), four aircraft flew to eastern Sui. Today (the 15th), six more aircraft flew from Dolun through Zhangbei Shangdu to the Sui area for reconnaissance, and returned to their original locations after an hour and a half. They did not drop bombs. Furthermore, yesterday (the 14th) at 11:00 a.m., a biplane flew from Dolun and landed in Zhangbei, and four tanks arrived.</p>
<p>Certain Parties Often Substitute Bricks and Stones for Military Supplies</p>
<p>This place is the throat for the transportation of military supplies for the puppet bandit army. All military supply transportation passes through it. Unexpectedly, a certain party's military supply vehicle arrived here the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the wooden box containing the bullets suddenly broke, and it was mostly filled with bricks, stones, and tiles, or it was to boast that their military supplies were sufficient to strengthen the faith of the puppet bandits and to deceive foreigners. Currently, a certain party official claims that 50 tons of bullets and artillery shells have now been transported to a certain place. However, thirty heavy trucks of military supplies arrived again quickly today (the 15th), and they will be able to transport all of them in five or six days. Or perhaps it is also a frightening statement for another purpose. In addition, all officers and soldiers of the various Chahar puppet Mongol units have replaced red armbands uniformly since the 16th of this month. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yan Xishan Destroys His Home to Relieve the National Crisis: Following His Mother's Instructions, He Donates His Late Father's Estate of 870,000 Yuan to the Finance Department to Be Used for Military Expenses in Suiyuan Province <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, recently received instructions from his mother that, in view of the current grave national crisis and the heavy burden on the people, and with various places donating funds to reward the soldiers and boost morale, he should donate his late father, Ziming's, entire estate, totaling 870,000 yuan, for national salvation purposes, setting an example for the world by destroying his home to relieve the national crisis. After receiving the order, Yan immediately convened a family meeting and allocated the funds as requested, handing them over to the Shanxi Provincial Department of Finance for receipt and distribution. He also sent a letter to the Finance Department, instructing them to dispatch personnel immediately to take stock of the funds. The letter stated, "Respectfully, I received a kind instruction from my mother yesterday, saying, 'The national crisis is so severe, and people across the country are donating funds to aid Suiyuan. You, as the senior official of Jin and Sui, should especially take the lead. Moreover, destroying your home to relieve the national crisis was your father's dying wish. You should immediately donate your father's estate of 870,000 yuan for national salvation purposes. I believe you will also be happy to do so.' I should naturally comply with the order and have the funds allocated by the administrators for receipt by your department. To the Department of Finance, Yan Xishan, November 11th."</p>
<p>Regarding the matter, Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Provincial Government, made a detailed report during the memorial week held at the Sui Office and the Provincial Government on the morning of the 16th, stating, "On the 11th of this month, Director Yan sent a letter to the Department of Finance (original text above). When Mr. Yan's late father, Ziming, was ill, he designated a portion of his family property to be donated: 50,000 yuan to Shanxi Province, 30,000 yuan to Wutai County, and 20,000 yuan to Hebian Village, to be used as social welfare funds. Director Yan has already carried out these instructions. I also recall that when the old gentleman was on his deathbed, I accompanied Director Yan at his side and personally heard him say to Director Yan, 'I have engaged in some business throughout my life and have accumulated some savings. If the country faces difficulties in the future, you can donate all of it to the country for national salvation purposes,' and instructed the old lady to take care of the matter. Now, the old lady, in view of the severity of the national crisis, has instructed Director Yan to carry out the old gentleman's will. My feelings about this matter are very deep. The Book of Rites says, 'It is good to accumulate wealth and be able to distribute it,' but it is far less significant than 'destroying your home to relieve the national crisis.' Everyone, think about it, what use of wealth could be greater or more meaningful than using it to save the country? There is definitely none. We should all think deeply about this."</p>
<h3 id="e69">North China Air Service Begins: Opening Ceremony Held in Tianjin on the 17th; Nine Aircraft Assigned to Four Routes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Preparations for the Sino-Japanese air service have been underway for nearly two months. Today, the opening ceremony of the Huitong General Aviation Company was held on the 17th, and air service will officially begin on the 18th. The opening ceremony was held at the newly built airfield in front of the Japanese barracks in Li Mingzhuang in the eastern suburbs of Tianjin. The airfield has a newly built hangar that can accommodate ten aircraft. Around 9 a.m. that day, Chinese and foreign dignitaries arrived one after another. For a time, the Dongjuzi Road was bustling with traffic. At 10 a.m. sharp, dozens of people arrived, including Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, Tianjin Security Commander Liu Jialuan, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau Chen Juesheng, Song Zheyuan's representative Zhang Bi, Qin Dechun's representatives Liu Shifu and Wang Yitang, Cao Rulin, and Lu Zongyu. From the Japanese side came Commander Tadashi, Consul General Horiuchi, Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Naval Attaché to Tianjin Kubota, and military staff including Iide, Kazu, and Ikeda, and Sentada, totaling dozens of people. Together with guests from all walks of life, there were over 300 attendees. During the ceremony, the band played the Chinese and Japanese national anthems. Chairman Zhang Yunrong and Vice Chairman Kodama Tsuneo of Huitong Aviation Company then gave speeches in Chinese and Japanese, respectively, reporting on the preparations. They stated, "Today, our company is holding its opening ceremony. We are honored and grateful for the presence of all the guests and the congratulatory letters and telegrams from friends from all sides. I can report to everyone in detail on the preparations of our company. The issue of Sino-Japanese air service has been discussed for a long time. It was proposed during the Beiping Political Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan. When Wang Kemin was the chairman, it was discussed several times, but it was ultimately deemed too hasty, and no decision was made. This time, the Japanese side brought up the old matter again, and Chairman Song continued the previous proposal of the central government and negotiated again. Fortunately, both sides were able to conduct sincere discussions based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and reached a general decision in the shortest possible time, entrusting Yunrong and others to step up preparations and plan in detail. Now, the preparations are complete, and we have decided to hold the opening ceremony today. The company's capital was originally set at 4.5 million, to be borne equally by both sides. The flight routes will be centered on Tianjin, initially opening four routes: Tianjin to Dalian, Tianjin to Jinzhou, Tianjin to Chengde, and Tianjin to Zhangjiakou. The aircraft equipment is designed for comfort, and the ticket prices are designed to be affordable. In terms of technology, we have experienced pilots from both China and Japan. We also plan to establish night flights to seek new developments in the history of transportation. As for the company's organization, it fully complies with the Chinese Company Law, first submitting to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee through the local government for record-keeping, and then requesting the competent department from the Political Affairs Committee for registration. In terms of management, we have decided to adopt a board system, with the board of directors fully handling all matters and taking responsibility for sound development. Both sides are determined to maintain this spirit of equality and mutual benefit from beginning to end, seeking co-existence and co-prosperity. Since the establishment of our company, transportation has become more convenient, and there will inevitably be great contributions and developments in East Asian culture, commerce, and economy. However, at the beginning of the establishment, there are bound to be some crude and simple aspects. We hope that all parties will provide guidance and supervision at any time so that this great undertaking can advance with each passing day. Our company will definitely accept it sincerely to meet the expectations of everyone." Subsequently, Zhang Bi gave a congratulatory speech on behalf of Song Zheyuan, and Tadashi gave a speech. Zhang Zizhong and Horiuchi also gave congratulatory speeches. Then, Liu Shifu, representing Qin Dechun, read congratulatory telegrams. Feng Zhian, Liu Ruming, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Terauchi, Minister of Communications Raimu, Navy Minister Nagano, and the Kwantung Army also sent congratulatory messages, which were read one by one. The ceremony ended around 11 a.m. A picnic was then held inside the hangar. Tadashi raised his glass and shouted "Long live Huitong" three times. At that time, eight aircraft formed a formation in the sky, performing technical maneuvers. Then, the company presented each guest with two Japanese-style pastries, a wine glass, and two cards. From 11:30 a.m., guests were invited in batches to take a flight around the city for sightseeing for a week, which lasted until 1 p.m.</p>
<p>The company was originally scheduled to start air service on the 17th, but it was postponed by one day due to preparations and implemented on the 18th. The four routes were opened on the same day. There are a total of nine aircraft: one large Ford eight-seater aircraft, registration number 502; six Ford medium-sized aircraft, each with six seats, registration numbers "127," "128," "140," "1101," "1102," and "504"; and two Pasi small aircraft, each with two seats, registration numbers "1103" and "1104." These nine aircraft will temporarily maintain transportation. The large aircraft will operate on the Tianjin-Dalian route, the medium-sized aircraft will operate on the Beijing-Tianjin, Tianjin-Jinzhou, and Tianjin-Beijing routes, and the small aircraft will operate on the Tianjin-Chengde route. The Tianjin-Dalian route has frequent traffic, and it is planned to add two Douglas aircraft in the future, which can be realized next month. According to Zhang Yunrong, the company will start business tomorrow and is divided into four groups: the General Affairs Group, under which there are General Affairs and Planning Sections; the Business Group, under which there are Business, Accounting, and Supply Sections; the Aviation Group, which has Navigation and Communications Sections; and the Education Group, which has Education and Maintenance Sections. There are a total of seven directors, four from our side and three from the Japanese side. There are 60 employees, half Chinese and half Japanese. However, feeling the lack of pilot talent, it was decided to set up an aviation training class to cultivate talent. From now on, this company will be responsible for air transportation, and Japanese aircraft will no longer fly to Tianjin. The Tianjin-Baotou route was proposed by the Japanese side, but it is difficult to realize it for the time being. The matter of attaching mail can also be discussed later, but it will not be held for the moment. At 7 p.m. on the 17th, the Chinese and Japanese chairmen of Huitong Aviation Company specially hosted a reception at the Japanese Residents Association in the Japanese Concession to celebrate the company's establishment, attended by over 140 people including Zhang Zizhong, Tadashi, Wang Yitang, Cao Rulin, Chen Zhongfu, Hashimoto, and Horiuchi. The aviation negotiations concluded amid cheers. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Song Zheyuan and Han Fuqu Discuss Border Defense in Hebei and Shandong Provinces: Southern Hebei Defense to Be Significantly Reinforced; Wan Fulin Summoned to Meet Song; Feng Zhian's Troops to Be Moved to Baoding <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, departed from Beiping on the 13th of this month to personally oversee the autumn military exercise of the 29th Army in Gu'an. Mayor of Beiping Qin Dechun and the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei Feng Zhian also accompanied Song. After the 29th Army's autumn exercise concluded, Song, accompanied by Qin and Feng, traveled south along the Pingda Highway, inspecting the political situation in various counties and the local garrisons. On the 15th, they arrived in Hejian, where they reviewed the Fourth Brigade of Wang Zhanhai. On the morning of the 16th, they inspected the Hejian County Government and reviewed the Home Guard. In the afternoon, they traveled from Hejian to Nangong, where they stayed at the Nangong Commissioner's Office and summoned the commissioner, Liu Bida, and other officials for instructions. They spent the night in Nangong. Song and his party were solely inspecting the defense situation in the counties of southern Hebei, and it was deemed necessary to discuss the coordination and deployment of defenses in the border areas of Hebei and Shandong Provinces with Chairman Han Fuqu of Shandong. Coincidentally, Chairman Han Fuqu of Shandong traveled north from Jinan on the 16th to inspect northern Shandong. Upon arriving in Dezhou, Han contacted Chairman Song via long-distance telephone to arrange a meeting place. On the morning of the 17th, Han traveled north from Dezhou, and Song also departed from Nangong by car. The two met at noon in a certain location within the territory of Gucheng County, Hebei Province, to discuss issues related to joint defense of the Hebei-Shandong border. The two conversed for a long time and then parted ways. Song returned to Nangong from Gucheng, and Han also returned to Shandong from Gucheng. Thus, this important meeting concluded. On the evening of the 17th, Song and his entourage remained in Nangong. On the morning of the 18th, they departed from Nangong to Daming to review Chen Huafu's brigade. All the militia units in the counties of southern Hebei will be reviewed by Song one by one. Wan Fulin, commander of the 53rd Army, is currently overseeing the autumn military exercises of his troops in the Xinle area. Having received a telegram from Song, he also traveled from Xinle to Handan to meet with Song in Daming. It is reported that Song will significantly reinforce the defenses in southern Hebei, and he summoned Commander Wan and others to discuss everything. It is expected that Song will remain in southern Hebei for a day or two before returning north. Song will attend the inauguration of the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei, Feng Zhian. Song appointed Feng Zhian to govern Hebei because Song himself was unable to attend to Hebei's affairs and the military, political, and diplomatic matters of Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin were extremely numerous. Therefore, he resigned from the position of Chairman of Hebei and appointed Feng Zhian, commander of the 37th Division of the 29th Army, to succeed him. Feng is a key member of the 29th Army and has a close relationship with Song as a subordinate who has shared hardships with him. Therefore, Feng's governance of Hebei is merely a substitute for Song's governance of Hebei. As a result, there is no need to change the heads of the various departments and commissions in Hebei Province, and everything will proceed in accordance with the normal course. The political affairs are proceeding without interruption. Currently, only the secretarial office and the accounting and general affairs sections of the provincial government are preparing to conclude and await handover. All other sections and departments, as well as the provincial departments and commissions, are working as usual. After Song issued an order appointing Feng Zhian to govern Hebei, he immediately informed the provincial departments and commissions of the truth and instructed them to continue to assist Feng in promoting provincial affairs. Feng's inauguration date in Baoding will be after Song returns from southern Hebei, around the 20th. At that time, Song will introduce Feng to the heads of the various departments and commissions. As for the 37th Division commanded by Feng, it will be moved to Baoding for garrison duty. From then on, Feng will be stationed here for a long time so that he can attend to military and political affairs at any time. After Feng's inauguration, Song will return to Beiping immediately. Song's special train has already departed from Beiping and arrived in Baoding, ready for use. It may travel from Baoding south to Handan for Song to use when he returns north from southern Hebei. The Baoding Public Security Bureau is currently preparing to welcome Song, Feng, and others to Baoding. Civil servants in various agencies are also actively training in preparation for Song's review.

<p>The border violations by the puppet bandits and the outbreak of the war in Suiyuan are of great importance to the nation and the people. Our soldiers at the front are defending the territory of the country in the freezing cold and fighting the bandits and puppets. All countrymen should fulfill their national duties and provide spiritual or material comfort to the soldiers who are defending the territory and loyal to the country. Various agencies and groups in this county, such as the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the County Chamber of Commerce, as well as the silk factory labor union and various schools, have been stirred by patriotic zeal and are enthusiastically contributing to provide powerful assistance. At the same time, all personnel of the local court donated 136.30 yuan and remitted it to the front to provide condolences. In addition, all 149 detainees in the court's detention center voluntarily fasted for one day yesterday (the 19th), and the money saved was sent to the front line, which is especially inspiring. In addition, Xing Yuantang, the warden of the Jiangsu Fifth Prison, and all staff members, used one day's income to console the soldiers resisting the enemy.</p>

<p>The Dingshan area outside the North Gate of this city is mostly mountainous. In addition to farming, residents rely on the mountain's products as their biggest sideline. In autumn and winter, residents must climb the mountains to prune trees and cut firewood. On the afternoon of the 18th, Xu Gengsong was cutting firewood when he suddenly discovered a large centipede in a valley. It was over two feet long, as thick as a flat buckle, and had a red glow on its head. It moved very quickly. Upon seeing it, Xu was extremely frightened and ran to tell his neighbors. According to the crowd, such a giant creature must have a pearl on its body. The crowd immediately climbed the mountain with weapons to search and capture it. After three hours, they found nothing. For a time, it was rumored as a strange tale.</p>

Although Suiyuan is located on the border, it is actually a barrier for our country. The importance of its position and the loyalty and bravery of the stationed troops in defending the territory have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers and need not be repeated. We, who are in the business world and work for foreign firms, have many individuals who have participated in the patriotic movement in their personal capacity, but we have not yet heard of a collective effort as a whole group. The strength is quite weak. We and others believe that the Suiyuan troops are defending the territory and are brave and commendable and should receive material comfort to encourage the loyal and brave soldiers. Since various circles have taken the lead, how can we be willing to lag behind? We and others are specially volunteering to donate one day's salary each to show our support. Once the amount is collected, we will send it to the Shen Bao newspaper for forwarding to the front to express our respect.

We have prepared and sent a letter with the amount of one day's salary from all colleagues of our bank, totaling 151 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen in national currency. Please investigate and collect it, issue a receipt, and hand it to the bearer to take back. We would be grateful. However, given the seriousness of the Sui situation, saving Sui is saving the country.

We hope you will consider how to handle this. Yours sincerely, to the Shanghai Banking Industry Association."</p>

<h3 id="e92">Mellor Confers with Kung: The Anti-Smuggling Office Will Not Be Moved Elsewhere: Nearly in a State of Suspension: Smugglers are Very Active: More Than 40 Million in Tax Evasion on the Beining Railway This Year <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reported that the Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office, after being moved from Beijing to Tianjin, has been unable to carry out its work actively due to various reasons. Recently, due to conflicts with customs anti-smuggling, there has been talk of moving it elsewhere, resulting in a state of suspension. Deputy Director Li Tonghua specially came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit Inspector General of Customs Mellor to ask for instructions. He has already gone to Beijing. Mellor reported the situation to Finance Minister Kung and was summoned to meet with Kung to discuss solutions. It was decided not to move the Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office and to order Ansell to go north immediately to carry out anti-smuggling work. The Shenshi News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that during the period when the road anti-smuggling inspection work was suspended, the Jidong area took the opportunity to carry out large-scale smuggling. Various unscrupulous merchants also took advantage of this to purchase and stockpile in large quantities. A certain merchant bank specially provided loans to support smugglers, with a huge amount. According to estimates from certain sources, from January to the end of October this year, the smuggled goods transported to Tianjin via the Beining Railway resulted in more than 40 million in tax evasion, mainly artificial silk and cotton cloth. Furthermore, according to the reporter's investigation, the smuggled goods stockpiled by unscrupulous merchants in North China, such as artificial silk and cotton cloth, have recently colluded with Japanese ruffians to transport them south, selling them in various places by breaking them into smaller lots. A certain yarn factory in this port even sent an employee to Tianjin to contact them. If smuggled goods were transported to Shanghai, they would be temporarily stored in the factory and then contact unscrupulous merchants to change their appearance and find ways to sell them. Most of them were also artificial silk. Recently, the factory has plans to set up an artificial silk factory to cover up the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Chinese Commissioner for the Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation, Liang Yu-gao, is Scheduled to Fly to Yunnan Today; Issues Important Statement Before Departure <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liang Yu-gao, the chief commissioner of the Chinese-British Joint Yunnan-Burma Southern Section Boundary Affairs Committee, made the following statement to the National News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>"Regarding the Yunnan-Burma border demarcation work, I have been assigned to continue the demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma boundary. I am scheduled to fly to Yunnan from Shanghai on the 20th of this month, leading all the staff directly to the border area. Before departure, I have a few words to say to the people of the country. Our country has a vast territory and is bordered by many powerful nations, so boundary disputes have been constant from the Qing Dynasty to the present day. Among those in the southwest, the most important is the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border. The undemarcated border is divided into northern and southern sections. The northern section concerns Pianma, Jiangxinpo, and other places, while the southern section includes Lufang, Ban Hong, Ximeng, and other areas. These areas are extremely rich in mineral resources, especially gold and silver. The dispute lies in these resources. Last year, I was appointed as the chief commissioner of the Chinese side of the Chinese-British Joint Yunnan-Burma Southern Section Boundary Affairs Committee. I entered the mountains in winter, met with the British commissioners and the neutral chairman appointed by the League of Nations, and conducted on-site surveys, enduring hardship and exposure to the elements. By April of this spring, due to the approaching rainy season, the meeting was adjourned and we returned to Beijing. However, in terms of work, only half of the overall task was completed. Therefore, this session will continue the work to achieve full success. The Sino-British joint survey of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border is based on the exchange of notes between the two governments on April 9, 1935. This document has already been published, and I believe readers have already read it. The Boundary Affairs Committee is composed of five commissioners, with China and Britain each having two, and a neutral commissioner selected by the League of Nations as chairman to impartially adjudicate all disputes. The work of the committee is to interpret Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the 1897 treaty (Guangxu 23rd year), i.e., to determine the true meaning of the treaty based on on-site surveys of geographical, political, and historical factors. The details of this are all in the Terms of Reference of the committee, which I will not repeat here. However, there are two points that I hope the people of the country will pay attention to: (1) The survey work is based on the old treaty and provides a reasonable interpretation, not to cancel the old treaty. This is the established policy of both governments, and we are only carrying it out from our own standpoint. (2) The work of the committee is limited to on-site surveys, investigation on the ground, in other words, just investigation. The majority decisions in the meeting only represent the opinions of the majority of the commissioners on factual matters, not that 'once a decision is made, the boundary line is set.' The power of 'delimitation' still lies in the direct consultations between the two governments afterwards and has nothing to do with the current work of the committee. The report of the committee has considerable weight, but it cannot bind the negotiations between the two governments. As for 'demarcation' (setting up stakes), it is even after 'delimitation.' The committee has no right to do this, needless to say. Last year, reports said that our team and the British team had erected boundary stakes in several places, which are purely unreasonable rumors. Moreover, the entire area of the undemarcated southern section, from the Nantin River in the north to the Nanma River in the south, has no formal boundary stakes. As for the three stone piles privately erected by Qing Dynasty boundary officials Liu Wansheng and Chen Can with the British officer Scott, I declared my rejection of them during last year's meeting, and the chairman decided to cancel them. Therefore, there are no boundary lines in the area, let alone boundary stakes. This session of the border demarcation work is scheduled to begin at the end of the year and will be completed before the rainy season next spring. After I arrive in Kunming, I will lead my staff directly to the border area to meet with the British commissioners and the neutral chairman in Bangsang. The first meeting is scheduled to be held on January 1, 1937. However, the work of this session is even more difficult than before. I feel a great responsibility, and I hope the people of the country will not abandon us and will give us advice from time to time. I would be deeply honored," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Guangdong Bank's Shanghai Branch Ordered to Resume Business on a Fixed Date; Raised Sufficient Registered Capital of 8 Million Hong Kong Dollars; Half of the Deposits to be Converted into Shares, the Remainder to be Repaid in Five Years <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the closure of Guangdong Bank on September 4th last year had a significant social impact, and the movement to resume business had been brewing for a long time. Recently, with the assistance of Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council, and the financial community, it was reorganized in Hong Kong on the 14th of this month. A new shareholders' meeting was convened, and Song Ziwen was elected as chairman of the board, with Wu Tiecheng, Deng Mianren, Huo Zhitong, etc. as managing directors, and Sun Ke, Hu Bijian, Huo Baoshu, Lao Jingxiu, Tang Haian, Song Zi'an, etc. as directors, actively preparing for the resumption of business.</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch Opens Simultaneously</p>
<p>Before its closure, the bank was a hub for financial institutions of overseas Chinese in South China and Southeast Asia. Branches were set up at home and abroad, including the Hong Kong head office, as well as branches in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Taishan, Bangkok, and San Francisco, USA. These branches closed simultaneously last year. Recently, the Hong Kong head office has decided to resume business on the 23rd. The Shanghai branch has also received a telegram ordering it to resume business simultaneously on that day. The manager of the Shanghai branch is still Zhang Rongpu, and Liang Guanliu is the assistant manager. The branch has been prepared, and some employees have returned to work as usual. It is reported that branches in Yuehan and Bangkok San Francisco and other places will also open simultaneously.</p>
<p>Method of Repaying Deposits</p>
<p>According to sources at the Hua Dong News Agency, the bank's original deposits in all branches amounted to 9 million Hong Kong dollars (calculated with interest up to the date of closure last year). It had been agreed with creditors that half of the amount, approximately 4.5 million yuan, would be used as new share capital, and the remaining half would be issued as unsecured debt notes, to be repaid in five installments, once a year, each time paying one-fifth, without interest. The first repayment date is within one year after the resumption of business.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank has planned to establish a national agricultural warehouse network to regulate agricultural production and facilitate the flow of agricultural funds, in order to coordinate the marketing of agricultural products nationwide, balance agricultural prices, and regulate food supply. It plans to establish large-scale cooperative warehouses in terminal markets with convenient land and water transportation, and smaller food warehouses in agricultural product distribution markets or towns and villages in the production areas. It has decided to cooperate with provincial, city, and county governments. A reporter from the New News Agency has obtained the following outline of the plan from banking circles: Cooperation methods: (1) For large-scale warehouses aimed at coordinating the marketing of agricultural products nationwide, balancing agricultural prices, and regulating the national food supply, the Bureau (Agricultural and Commercial Bank) plans to set up and operate them. Local provincial and municipal governments may participate in the investment, but their investment amount should not exceed 40% of the total capital. (2) For smaller warehouses aimed at regulating rural finance, facilitating the marketing of agricultural products, and stabilizing agricultural prices, provincial, city, and county governments plan to set up and operate them. The construction funds for the warehouses can be provided by the Bureau by 40%, but provincial, city, and county governments must reliably guarantee the repayment of principal and interest in installments. (3) For provincial, city, and county governments that establish agricultural warehouses, the required storage and mortgage funds can be provided by the Bureau as appropriate, but provincial, city, and county governments must reliably guarantee the repayment of principal and interest. (4) Upon request from provincial, city, and county governments that establish agricultural warehouses, the Bureau can send personnel to assist in the design and training of agricultural warehouse management personnel. (5) Detailed methods for the Bureau to assist provincial, city, and county governments in setting up agricultural warehouses will be negotiated and determined separately by the Bureau and provincial, city, and county governments.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Yangtze River Water Level Drops Again; Large Vessels are Suspended; Japan Shipping Company's Luoyang Maru Has Suspended Navigation; Ocean Vessels on the Upper Reaches are Blocked; There is Concern that Further Water Level Drops Will Lead to Interrupted Navigation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has been declining even more in recent days, and the Yangtze River shipping business of the six companies has been severely hindered. Yesterday, the various shipping companies in this port received telegrams from Hankou stating that the water level in the Hankou-Jiujiang section has dropped to 11 feet 5 inches (including the draft). River vessels traveling upstream and downstream are only allowed to load cargo to 11 feet and must not exceed the limit. The six companies have all implemented reductions in cargo loads. For example, river vessels that can normally carry 1,500 tons can now only load a maximum of 650 tons. Vessels with an empty draft of 12 feet are all suspended from sailing. The Japan Shipping Company has decided to suspend the navigation of its large river vessel Luoyang Maru. Furthermore, the ocean vessels that sailed from Shanghai and Haizhou to Hankou, Yuezhou, and other places in early October to transport coal and salt have been unable to sail downstream due to the sharp drop in water levels. More than a dozen vessels are effectively blocked and stopped on the upper reaches. If the water level continues to decline, there is a risk that navigation on the upper reaches will be interrupted. At that time, cargo transportation will have to rely on barges. The six companies are all preparing remedial measures. Yesterday, a telegram from Yichang reported that the water level in Shashi has dropped to 6 feet, making it difficult for larger vessels to navigate. Therefore, the six companies have agreed to increase the shallow water fee for the Yangtze River (i.e., Shanghai to Hankou) by 25% and the fee for Hankou to Yichang (i.e., the middle Yangtze River, including Shashi) by 50%, effective from the first of next month. The announcement has been made to all passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Toyota Factories Labor Dispute Has Not Been Resolved; Strikes Have Resumed at Factories in Shanghai and Other Places; All Workers at the Numbers One and Two Nei Wai Cotton Mills Have Also Gone on Strike; A Large Number of Workers Arrested for Allegedly Instigating the Labor Unrest —The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Expedite Mediation— <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, after the labor strike at the Toyota yarn factory in western Shanghai, all the workers at the Numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 Nei Wai Cotton Mills also went on strike last night. Strikes have been resumed in the Shanghai Numbers 2 and 3 and Tong Xing Number 2 Factories in the eastern Shanghai district. Labor unrest is also about to occur at the Ri Hua and Xi He Factories. The Municipal Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to properly handle the labor unrest at the Japanese-owned yarn factories as quickly as possible. The labor dispute at the British-owned New Ewo Sack Factory has been resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Two Toyota Factories Continue to Strike</p>
<p>Following the joint strike by more than 4,500 male and female workers at the Number 1 and 2 Toyota Factories, Japanese-owned factories located near Caogaodu Zhongshan Road Bridge in western Shanghai, which began on the evening of the 17th, the workers had not returned to work as of last night. Along the road in front of the two factories, in addition to the Chinese police and concession detectives stationed there, there were four or five Japanese marine corps soldiers on guard. Two armored vehicles were stationed inside the factories. According to Katsuiti Mizumura, the personnel section chief of the factory, who spoke to the Da Gong News Agency reporter who visited, the factory did not know about the workers' strike in advance, and the workers did not make any demands, which goes against the normal logic of a strike. Furthermore, the workers also destroyed the workshop of the Number 2 Factory during the strike, resulting in significant losses. Even if the workers return to work, the factory will need to be reorganized for a considerable period of time before it can start operating, he said.</p>
<p>The Unrest is Spreading in the Nei Wai Factories</p>
<p>At the Numbers 1 and 2 Nei Wai Cotton Mills on Robison Road in western Shanghai, a total of more than 3,200 day and night shift workers, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, 1,600 workers from the weaving and spinning departments of the day shift stopped working voluntarily, causing disputes with the foremen. The factory was unable to stop them and released all the male and female workers on the day shift. At 5:30 p.m., the female workers of the night shift, influenced by the propaganda of the Japanese workers, also joined the strike. On Xiaoshadu Road and Robison Road, near the Nei Wai Cotton Mills, there were more than 3,000 male and female workers standing on the road and sidewalks, watching each other. The factory was closed tightly. It was not until 7:15 p.m. that the police from the Xiaoshadu Road Police Station and the Caogaodu Public Security Sub-bureau and the Robison Road Police Station combined their efforts to disperse them. As for the Numbers 5, 6, and 7 Nei Wai Cotton Mills on Yichang Road, only two-thirds of the Japanese workers went to work. Due to the impact of the strike at the Numbers 1 and 2 Factories, except for a small number of workers in the weaving department who went to work, the workers in the spinning department of the night shift have all gone on strike. There has been no movement at the Numbers 3 and 4 Nei Wai Cotton Mills and the Number 8 Factory on Gordon Road and the Number 9 Factory on Dagok Road.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting Proposes Conditions</p>
<p>More than 300 workers from various Japanese-owned Nei Wai factories held a representatives' conference at 9:00 a.m. yesterday in the playground of a primary school in a people's new village on Zhongshan Road. In addition to appointing eight group leaders to direct the actions of the factories, they also proposed five conditions, which were unanimously passed as follows: (1) Increase wages by 20%; (2) Workers may not be dismissed without reason; (3) Dismissed workers shall be allowed to return to work; (4) Abolish workship laboring, restore original bounty laboring; (5) Each factory shall elect 20 representatives, and a total of 120 representatives from the factories shall elect 16 general representatives to be responsible for negotiating with the factory. If the factory dismisses the representatives, all the workers in the factories shall provide assistance. After an hour and a half, Tan Baoshou, the director of the Caogaodu Sub-bureau, heard the news and immediately led a large number of police to rush to the scene to persuade them to disperse.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate</p>
<p>Regarding the outbreak of labor unrest at the Toyota yarn factory and other factories, the Municipal Government is very concerned. In order to resolve the unrest as soon as possible, it has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to find ways to properly mediate and resolve the dispute. Currently, Pan, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has instructed the Third Section to send Zhu Guilun and Zhang Chuqiang, and the General Labor Union has sent Wan Banghe to investigate the labor unrest. It is planned to summon the persons in charge and representatives of the striking factories for questioning first, and then conduct formal mediation to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Strikes Break Out Again in Shanghai Tong Xing</p>
<p>The workers at the Japanese-owned Shanghai Numbers 2 and 3 Factories at Guangxin Wharf on Yangshupu Road, in order to demand a general wage increase, put forward five conditions and first launched a joint strike on the evening of the 8th of this month, which lasted for four days. The factory then agreed with the foremen of each department to increase wages by 5%. After being persuaded by party and government agencies, all the workers reluctantly returned to work on the 12th. However, since the workers returned to work, the factory has not issued a formal announcement acknowledging the wage increase. The workers believe that the factory is deceiving them, so at 11:00 p.m. on the 18th, all the night shift workers suddenly announced a strike while working and left the factory. Furthermore, the Tong Xing Number 2 Factory on Yangshupu Road also experienced a labor strike yesterday morning. The inside story of this second strike is very complicated.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Male and Female Workers Arrested</p>
<p>When the night shift at the Shanghai Numbers 2 and 3 Factories went on strike, the Great Western Road Police Station sent a large number of detectives to suppress them. Zhang Linzhen and 10 other workers in the spinning room were arrested on the spot on suspicion of instigating the labor unrest and detained that night. At about 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, about 800 male and female workers petitioned the Great Western Road Police Station, demanding their release. The police station refused the request, saying that further investigation was needed. At noon, 18 more workers were arrested at the factory, and four workers were also arrested at the Tong Xing Number 2 Factory. All of them were transferred to the Special District Court for handling.</p>
<p>The Japan Textile Federation is Very Concerned</p>
<p>Funatsu, the chairman of the Japan Textile Industry Association in China, told the Da Gong News Agency reporter that the association is very concerned about the outbreak of labor unrest in the factories in the western Shanghai district. When the problems in western Shanghai have not been resolved, strikes have broken out again in factories in Shanghai and other places, which are shaking the future of the Japanese-owned yarn industry. At a time when the operating profit this year has improved, this unfortunate incident has occurred, and it is not difficult to understand who is directing and instigating it. The association, as a yarn industry group, will certainly do its best to eliminate this labor unrest as soon as possible to maintain the development of our country's industry in China, he said.</p>
<p>The Labor Dispute at the British-Owned Ewo Factory Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>More than 300 workers at the British-owned New Ewo yarn factory sack factory on Weituoma Road, Yangshupu, put forward seven demands to the factory, including wage demands. The factory refused to accept them, which caused a strike. The Municipal General Labor Union sent its cadre Fang Banghe to contact the factory, and the representative Zhang Rongsheng from Baotou, and a satisfactory result was achieved. All the workers returned to work last night.</p>
<p>Japanese Marines Stationed at Various Factories</p>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps, at the request of the Ri Hua, Gong Da, Nei Wai Cotton, Xi He, Shanghai Numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, Tong Xing, Yu Feng, Dong Hua, and Gong Da Number 2 Factories in the western Shanghai district and the eastern Shanghai district, dispatched a large number of soldiers, more than 500 in total, to various factories yesterday morning to be stationed there for protection. The police station and the Public Security Bureau have also sent more police officers to be closely guarded near the factories to prevent any incidents.</p>

In addition to all the members, dozens of representatives from various member factories also attended. The event was lively and convivial. It is reported that the purchases of domestic goods from Southeast Asia have reached more than 1.5 million yuan. If organized sales are carried out in the future, the prospects are unlimited.

<h3 id="e108">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendment to Grain Storage Method <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan in Nanjing: On the 18th of this month, we received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation stating that the General Outline of Local Grain Storage Methods, revised and passed by the Executive Yuan in its 287th meeting, comprehensively considers national and people's livelihoods. The methods are extremely strict and the standards are exceptionally fair. During this time of national crisis, grain storage is an essential policy to be implemented, and our merchants naturally cannot shirk their responsibility. However, upon examining Article 16 of the original outline, the fundraising method stipulates that the collection should be based on the ratio of field tax, business tax, house tax, and other property income, striving for simplicity and fairness. Upon close inspection, including business tax as one of the items seems to place an excessively heavy burden on merchants, which does not fully align with the principles of simplicity and fairness. Moreover, assessing it based on the ratio of other property income is also inevitably uneven. Our Chamber has already telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting appropriate amendments to the original outline. All fundraising from merchants for grain storage donations should be based on the net profit of business operations, as stipulated in the last paragraph of Article 16, concerning the ratio of other property income, so as to be more adaptable to other fundraising standards. We request its adoption and prompt reconsideration, to establish sound regulations and ensure fairness." They also requested a unanimous agreement to pass the matter. It is noted that preparing grain for famine relief, and utilizing it for the development of rural production when necessary, is an essential local policy. However, when the funds allocated under the provincial, municipal, and county income items are insufficient, they may be raised through fundraising. The fundraising standard is based on the ratio of field tax, business tax, house tax, and other property income. The term "business tax" undoubtedly refers to merchants. Merchants themselves pay business tax in their commercial locations, and various taxes and levies are imposed on the transportation and sale of goods. If the grain storage donation is collected based on business turnover, the burden will inevitably be too heavy. The Federation proposes to base the fundraising on the net profit of business operations, according to the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 16 of the General Outline of Grain Storage Methods, which concerns the ratio of other property income. This is a fair proposal. It is appropriate to telegraph this to the esteemed Executive Yuan, requesting its adoption and amendment of Article 16 of the General Outline, as it would be both fair and convenient. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Zhejiang Silk Control Association Borrows 400,000 Yuan, China and Communications Banks Each Lend 200,000 <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee, due to the impact of weather on this year's autumn silkworm harvest, resulting in a significant reduction in yield and causing cocoon prices to soar in various regions with demand exceeding supply, has decided to increase spring silkworm eggs to meet the needs of various regions and develop the silk industry, in order to distribute them in large quantities for hatching in various regions. However, the spring silkworm eggs produced domestically next spring are insufficient to meet the distribution needs of various regions. As a remedial measure, they have borrowed 400,000 yuan from the China and Communications Banks to order 800,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs from abroad. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, it was learned from the Bank of China that the 800,000 sheets of spring silkworm eggs ordered by the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee cost 7.5 jiao per sheet, totaling 600,000 yuan. In addition to the 200,000 yuan supplemented from the profits of the Committee's sale of spring silkworm silk, there is still a shortfall of 400,000 yuan. As a result, they consulted with Jin Runquan, the manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China. Jin came to Shanghai to request approval from the head office. The China and Communications Banks each assumed 200,000 yuan of the loan. The loan agreement has been signed, with an interest rate of 9%, using the silkworm eggs as collateral. It is expected that the principal and interest will be repaid in full when the spring cocoons are available on the market next year.</p>

<p>"To the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command, Security Office, Municipal Government, and forwarded to all legal entities, newspaper offices, and military units: The siege of Xi'an in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, from mid-April to November 28th of that year, lasted eight months before the siege was lifted. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians died. In those times, ammunition was exhausted, and aid was cut off. Even porridge was insufficient, and people resorted to eating grass, boiling leather, and consuming oil residue. Yet, with one heart, day and night, they fought valiantly, vowing to never surrender, finally preserving the famous city and consolidating the revolutionary base in the Northwest, contributing to the success of the Northern Expedition. The tragic and heroic circumstances were unprecedented in our Party's revolutionary warfare. The people of Shaanxi Province hold a memorial ceremony every year on this day to never forget. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the memorial ceremony, coinciding with the daily worsening of foreign aggression and the severity of the national crisis. It is universally believed that only by promoting the martyrs can we encourage future generations, and only by honoring the fallen can we inspire morale. Therefore, a meeting has been convened to prepare for an expanded ceremony. We respectfully request memorial writings to highlight past achievements and uplift people's hearts, so that the red blood and loyal hearts may be further emphasized through eloquent words, and the deeds of loyalty and martyrdom may provide endless inspiration. We respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee for the Tenth Anniversary Commemoration and Public Memorial Ceremony of the Xi'an Siege."</p>

<h3 id="e114">Social Affairs Bureau Orders Factories to Quickly Establish Factory Regulations <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considering that there are thousands of factories in the city, but very few have established factory regulations and submitted them for record, which often leads to a lack of basis in case of disputes, yesterday issued a special order to all factories that have not established factory regulations, or have established them but not submitted them, to quickly draft and submit them for approval. The original order stated: "According to the instructions in the Municipal Government's Order No. 2081, which approved the Ministry of Industry's Labor Document No. 5294, factory regulations are the standard for factories' treatment of workers, and are of great importance to workers' welfare and industrial production. All factories should carefully establish them for compliance. Supervisory authorities should not allow factories to freely establish regulations or summarily approve them upon submission, as this can easily lead to malpractices. Previously, this Ministry collected factory regulations from various regions, and their contents often did not comply with the Factory Law and related laws, especially in the regulations concerning 'working hours,' 'holidays,' 'death benefits,' 'termination of contracts,' 'wage payment,' and 'apprentices' food, lodging, medical, and allowance.' Moreover, the number of factory regulations that have not been submitted to the supervisory authorities for approval is very large, and even those that have been submitted for approval still have a few that conflict with the law. This is not in compliance with Article 75 of the Factory Law. Hereafter, these regulations must be strictly reviewed in accordance with the Factory Law and its related laws, and all factories that have not submitted their regulations for review must quickly draft and submit them for approval in accordance with the law, to emphasize the law and benefit labor. In addition to distribution, please investigate and instruct compliance.' In accordance with this, the Bureau is ordered to comply immediately and instruct compliance. Considering that there are thousands of factories in this city, and only a few have established factory regulations and submitted them to this Bureau for approval in accordance with the law, labor disputes often arise due to the lack of legal factory regulations as a basis. As a result of the foregoing orders, you are ordered to comply. All factories in this city that have not established factory regulations, or have established them but not submitted them, should quickly draft and submit them for approval in accordance with the law, to emphasize the law and benefit labor. This order, totaling more than one thousand nine hundred yuan."</p>

<p>Since the alliance of Taikoo and six other companies, it has been quite effective. Due to the shallow water level in the Yangtze River and slower navigation, a 25% increase in the shallow water fee was implemented on October 19th for cargo loaded from Hankou to Changsha and Xiangtan, and a 15% increase for cargo from Hankou to Shashi and Yichang. Now, the six companies must increase the shallow water fee again, based on water levels. The announcement from the six companies is as follows: Taikoo Navigation Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, Ning Shao Company, San Pei Company, and Nisshin Company announce that from December 1st, 1936, all cargo loaded from Shanghai to Wuhu and above, or from Wuhu upstream to Hankou, must be subject to a 25% shallow water fee based on water levels. Furthermore, from December 1st, 1936, all cargo loaded from Hankou to Yichang must be subject to a 50% shallow water fee based on water levels. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<p>The Jardine Matheson Company's Shenguang Steamer, at approximately 9:00 PM the night before, entered Shanghai harbor and docked at the Sanpei Company's Hongsheng Wharf at Laiyi Ferry in Pudong. At that time, the tide was quite strong, and as the ship was mooring alongside the wharf, the hull was buffeted by the tide, making it difficult to control. It violently collided with the Shenyou Steamer, which was moored at the southern end of the wharf. Six wharf boats were moored on the outer side of that steamer. The outermost boat, No. 6600, carrying 90 bags of white rice, bore the brunt of the impact. The entire boat, including the cargo, was overturned and the rice sank to the bottom of the river. Several boatmen fell under the overturned boat and were unable to climb out. The second boat, No. 4930, carrying 60 bags of rice, was overturned in succession due to the impact from the first boat, and the rice also sank to the bottom of the river. Several boatmen also fell under the boat. The third boat, No. 8640, had its scull shed frame and rudder frame crushed. The fourth boat, No. 8176, had its hull planks and stern corners crushed and damaged, and water entered. The fifth boat, No. 6222, had its guardrail broken. The innermost [sixth] boat had its scaffolding broken. It is evident that the force of the Shenguang Steamer's impact was violent. The estimated loss to the cargo of each boat is approximately ten thousand yuan. The Chinese police from the Customs Water Police Station immediately used axes to cut open the bottoms of the first and second outermost overturned boats, rescuing several boatmen. However, Chen Shunquan's daughter Miaoying, the boat owner of the first boat, who was only [blank] years old, and Zhang Gougou, a boatman from Chongming on the second boat, tragically drowned and sank. Their bodies have not yet surfaced as of last night. After the Shenguang Steamer caused the accident, it continued to dock at the wharf to unload cargo as usual. The owners of the damaged boats reported the incident to the Water Police Station yesterday morning to file a claim for compensation from the steamer company.</p>

<p>Zeng Yangfu, the director of the Huangpu Commercial Port Preparatory Office, has noted that the depth of the Pearl River estuary is decreasing daily, making it difficult for deeper-draft vessels to enter and exit, greatly affecting commerce in the Huangpu area. Therefore, he has requested the Naval Ministry's Hydrographic Office to send warships to sound the river for dredging purposes. As a result, the office has dispatched the Gong Sheng survey vessel and technical personnel to conduct sounding operations from the Lingdingyang waters of the Pearl River estuary to the Huangpu section, which is expected to be completed within one year.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenhua, a doctor at the Zhaofeng Road Hongkou Women's Hospital, and his mistress Chen Dabao (also known as Liang Meiyu), were arrested by the Huishan Police for strangling to death a woman named Lu Aili who underwent an abortion and a man named Yu Gengsheng on September 4th of this year, and burying their bodies underground. They were handed over to the First Special Court. After interrogation, Zhang was sentenced to death and Chen to life imprisonment. Zhang Wenhua, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Yu Enliang to draft a petition to the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>to file an appeal.</p>
<p>Details have already been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the female convict Chen Xiaobao is also dissatisfied with the verdict and has hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to draft a petition to the Second Branch of the High Court, stating her appeal. The reasons for the appeal are roughly as follows: The First Instance Judgment in this case charges the appellant Chen Xiaobao with joint responsibility, which is based solely on the fact that the appellant was present and participated a little when the killings occurred. Being present is one thing, and participating is another. The appellant does not deny being present, but as for participating, the facts are already</p>
<p>insufficient to prove,</p>
<p>and Zhang Wenhua has not implicated the appellant. Therefore, this point is really worth studying. Examining Zhang Wenhua's confessions, although there are slight inconsistencies, the actual course of events at the time can be roughly presumed. The deceased, Yu and Lu, went to the Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital to request an abortion. Zhang Wenhua was careless during the operation and cut Lu's uterus, causing internal bleeding and death. Fearing that Yu would make a fuss, Zhang tricked him into having blood drawn and killed him. The cause of death was</p>
<p>air leaking into the blood,</p>
<p>or an injection of a heavy dose of anesthesia. Zhang Wenhua's confessions are contradictory on this point, but the main cause of death was the injection. The Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital is run solely by Zhang Wenhua. The appellant is only a nurse and has virtually no medical knowledge. However, during the operation, she passed on the necessary items from the side. She had no right to question or participate in Zhang's surgery. Zhang Wenhua performed the abortion on Lu, and the</p>
<p>surgical error</p>
<p>was naturally something the appellant could not have known beforehand. Therefore, Lu's death was due to surgical error, and Yu's death was due to Zhang's conspiracy. The First Instance's statement of "participating from beginning to end" is arbitrary. As for whether Yu and Lu died from the abortion, the injection, or strangulation, it is not difficult to determine medically, as the circumstances of a living person being strangled and a dead person being strangled are clearly different. Moreover, according to legal principles, the cause of the crime should be based on the most important cause. In this case, Lu's</p>
<p>uterus was already ruptured,</p>
<p>leaving no hope of life. Yu was injected with a heavy dose of poison, also leaving no hope of life. Therefore, even if the fact of strangling with a towel existed, it cannot aggravate the crime, and the absence of it cannot mitigate the responsibility. It has no causal relationship with the deaths of Yu and Lu. Stepping back, even if Zhang informed the appellant beforehand of his plan to murder Yu after the abortion went wrong, the appellant, being a concubine, was completely under his control. Being a woman with limited knowledge, she would naturally lose her reason and judgment upon suddenly learning of the</p>
<p>impending disaster.</p>
<p>She could only obey in everything. This was due to her position and circumstances. Anyone else in her position would have done the same. How can one solely blame a woman with limited knowledge like the appellant? Therefore, considering the circumstances, the appellant's situation was extremely helpless. It is understandable to fault her for being weak and indecisive, but to say that she had a joint intention is not understanding. As for the subsequent</p>
<p>concealment of the corpses,</p>
<p>she was forced into this and had no other choice. Reporting her husband was something human nature could not allow. And if the corpses were not concealed, what else could be done? Regardless of moral principles and focusing solely on actions, it was only post-facto assistance, at most an accessory to the crime. However, the First Instance judged the appellant as a joint offender, which seems excessive in both law and reason. Therefore, she requests that the original verdict be overturned and a lawful judgment be made.</p>

<p>A female guest, claiming to be Zhang Chenshi, arrived at the Chunjiang Inn on Shandong Road in the Public Concession a few days ago. She was about thirty years old and checked into room 44. Late at night the previous evening, she committed suicide by ingesting opium, groaning in bed. The next morning, the tea boy discovered her. He informed the Old Zha Police Station, which sent an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for injections and treatment. She had taken a large amount of poison and it is unknown whether her life can be saved. A suicide note was found nearby, running to thousands of words, detailing her grievances. It was written, "Injustice sunk to the bottom of the sea, when will it be redressed?" The content was roughly that Ms. (Zhang Chenshi claimed to be) was from Baoshan. Since childhood, she was married through a matchmaker to Zhang Zhendong, a fellow townsman who runs the Tongtai Seafood Store in the Nanshi. They were married for more than ten years and had four children, of whom only one daughter, Wei Yong, now eleven years old, survives. Her husband's business had flourished in recent years and he had become rich, so he sought pleasure and married Hu Laosan, an undercover prostitute from Jiangyin, also known as Hu Xiufen, on the outside. Ms. Zhang Chenshi found out and questioned her husband, which aroused his suspicion. He colluded with his master, Sun Luling, to design all sorts of ways to force her to divorce. After being kicked out, she was pregnant and her husband still wanted to kill her. Having no other choice, she had to seek her own death to end her life. The situation is very tragic.</p>

<p>Li Heshi, a Cantonese woman aged twenty-two, residing at No. 12, Si Cheng Li, Julaida Road in the French Concession, was a obstetrician at He Ruizhen Obstetrics Hospital, No. 1, Qiqing Lane, Xin Guangdong Street, Qujiang Road, Hongkou. Her husband, Li Liang (also Cantonese and a doctor), worked at the Guangdong Hospital in Nanjing. After he died of illness a month ago, Ms. Li, saddened by her husband's death and her young widowhood, became depressed and suffered a nervous breakdown. She suddenly became tired of life. On the night of the 16th, Ms. Li first injected herself with a box of morphine needles, a total of ten, at home, but the anesthetic was ineffective. She then swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and became unconscious. The next morning (17th) at 8:00 AM, her mother, He Wangshi (44 years old, Cantonese), called her to get up. When she didn't respond, she discovered the suicide and sent her to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haige Road. However, she had taken too much poison and efforts to save her were ineffective. She died at 11:30 AM on the 18th. The hospital informed the French Police, who sent investigators to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Special Court. Inspector Wang Ren and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene. It was determined that the deceased died of poisoning. The body was handed over to the deceased's mother, He Wangshi, for burial.</p>

<p>French Ambassador to China, Nazia, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. On the 18th, he visited various schools in the French Concession with the French Consul General Baudas and the Inspector of Education of the French Concession, Gross. He paid particular attention to the Sino-French School and the French Public School. When he arrived at the Sino-French School on Min Ti Ni Yin Road, the principal and faculty of the school greeted him respectfully. The French Ambassador praised the school's excellent management and the growing number of students each year, acknowledging the efforts of the authorities. He then went to the French Public School, where the principal, Jiemeng, welcomed him ceremoniously and introduced the school's faculty to the French Ambassador. He was invited to visit the school's facilities. At 5:30 PM, the French Ambassador visited the office, main power plant, and newly installed water pumping facilities in the French Park at the French Water and Electricity Company on Lvban Road. Yesterday (19th) at 4:30 PM, Mr. Nazia, accompanied by Consul General Baudas, visited the French Concession Central Police Station and various affiliated agencies of the Police Department on Xuehuali Road. Police Chief Major Faber and his staff welcomed him into the building. Mr. Nazia got out of the car to a grand ceremony. Two teams of Russian and Vietnamese police and a special Chinese police team stood on either side, led by Chief Officer Gu Cai, saluting with their guns. At the same time, the police band played the French national anthem to express their welcome. Mr. Nazia paid close attention to all departments of the Police Department, especially the Secretariat, Political Office, Detective Office, Complaints Department, Fingerprint Section, and Wireless Telegraph Alarm Department.

<p>The operation of small rental cars and taxicabs in the Public Concession was once considered in the spring of last year, but it failed to materialize due to the opposition of the police authorities. Recently, a merchant raised the issue again and submitted it to the Municipal Council. The plan was to operate small rental cars, with each car equipped with a road meter to charge passengers. If the results are good, they plan to establish stations in the central area, where passengers can hail the cars along the way. The estimated fare is about half that of the current large rental cars. This matter was recently discussed in detail by the Police Committee of the Municipal Council. The Chief of the Police Department and the Director of the Donation Office presented their opinions. The Chief of the Police Department stated that although these small cars are structurally sound, they are not suitable for the traffic situation in this city. There is a conflict with the existing car rental industry, and future competition may lead to mutual losses. Furthermore, small cars may not be as convenient as rickshaws in terms of road space. The Director of the Donation Office also stated that the Public Concession authorities have always disapproved of small rental cars and taxicabs. This is why the current car rental business exists. This business has a large investment. If the Municipal Council allows small rental cars to appear on the market, the public should be given adequate preparation beforehand to avoid losses to the current car rental merchants. At a recent meeting of the Municipal Council, due to the continued opposition of the Chief of the Police Department, the authorities considered that there were many obstacles and decided to reject the proposal. Therefore, small rental cars and taxicabs will not appear on the market for the time being.</p>

<p>The Japanese newspaper, "Japanese Daily News," reported that Li Guochao, the 31-year-old grandson of the late Qing Dynasty official Li Hongyi, traveled to Japan on the 2nd of this month to investigate ancient pottery, paintings, precious metals, and works of art. He returned to Shanghai on the 18th and made the following statement: "I don't really know my grandfather, but I have heard about my grandfather's negotiations with Japan. However, as his grandson, I wanted to learn more about Japan, so I made a trip to Japan. I stayed in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto for two weeks. I met all the people who were related to my grandfather and was treated kindly. Mr. Oyama Toyotaro, the enemy who assassinated my grandfather in Yamaguchi Prefecture in the 28th year of Meiji, also met with me in Tokyo. Mr. Oyama told me about what happened at that time.

<p>Since the French Municipal Council first implemented the collection of vacant house tax, businesses and industries have been in agreement. The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession also suggested that the Municipal Council follow suit, but this has not yet materialized. The First Special District Citizens Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, urging them to implement it as soon as possible. The original letter stated, "According to a letter from the 21st Branch of our Federation, since the 'January 28th Incident' in Shanghai, all industries have been in a slump and are struggling to survive, resulting in an increasing number of vacant houses on various roads. The reason for this is that rents are too expensive, and businesses cannot afford them. Now that the French Municipal Council has determined that vacant houses affect the market and has implemented the collection of vacant house tax, our Public Concession can also follow suit. This measure will not only maintain tax revenue, but also the vacant house tax will encourage landlords to lower rents, which is a key to revitalizing the market. We hope that you will forward this letter to the Municipal Council to implement it as soon as possible for the benefit of the market."</p>

<h3 id="e133">Chen Dimin and Wife's Lawsuit Concludes: Wife Sues for Divorce, Husband Sues for Cohabitation. Both Cases Were Heard Together Yesterday and Concluded - Judgment Set for the 24th - <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Chen Dimin, a native of Anhui who resides at No. 379, Beile Road, in the French Concession and was formerly a comprador for a foreign firm in Lafayette Village, is 40 years old this year. He married Tan Kunfan, a woman from Suzhou (also 40 years old), in his early years, and they have six children. They lived together at No. 15, Lafayette Village, Lafayette Road. Last spring, a dispute arose, and after a fight, Tan took the children and left Chen's residence, returning to her mother's home on Dagu Road. She first reported Chen's assault and injury to the French police, who prosecuted Chen in the Special No. 2 Court. The court sentenced Chen to a fine of 20 yuan, suspended for two years. Later, Tan filed a suit for separation and alimony against Chen in the civil division of the Special No. 2 Court, resulting in a settlement where Chen would pay 350 yuan per month for living expenses and an additional 20 yuan for the children. They were to live separately for four months. Recently, Chen filed a suit for cohabitation against Tan in the civil division of the Special No. 2 Court, requesting that Tan Kunfan be ordered to return home with the children and the clothes and money she had taken. Tan also filed a suit for divorce against Chen, requesting alimony of 70,000 yuan and that Chen take back the children to raise. The court, based on the pleadings, had held a hearing once, the details of which were recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu presided over the joint hearing of the two cases in the Civil Division No. 7. First, the divorce case was heard. According to the plaintiff, Chen Tan Kunfan, they were married in Japan in the 7th year of the Republic (1918) and have photos as proof. After returning to China, because her mother objected, they remarried at the Huizhong Hotel. Now, because the defendant has an affair and mistreats her, she requests a divorce. Regarding alimony, the defendant is wealthy and certainly has the ability to pay, and so on. The defendant, Chen Dimin, was represented by a lawyer who stated that the defendant's affair with the plaintiff was true, but the wedding photos were to deceive her mother, and there was no actual marriage. The defendant has a legal wife surnamed Zai, who passed away in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). Regarding the alimony portion, Chen's property has already been mortgaged, and he is unable to pay. He is now requesting cohabitation, so there is naturally no need to pay. Moreover, the two parties were certified to have separated in the 8th year of the Republic (1919) by lawyers Heckmond and Teppick, but then continued to cohabit, and so on. He submitted the separation document as evidence and stated that Chen was willing to adopt the children. The court verified the situation, ordered a debate, and then declared the hearing concluded, setting the 24th for judgment. Then, the cohabitation case was heard. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff's wife had passed away, the defendant had been away for a long time, and the four-month period of agreed-upon separation had expired, so the court should order the defendant to return home with the children to cohabit. The defendant, Tan Kunfan, stated that the relationship between husband and wife was completely broken and they could not cohabit. After arguments by both sides' lawyers, the court declared the debate concluded and set the 24th for judgment.</p>
<p>The above totals 2,250 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 fen. Including previous donations, the total collected is 6,559 yuan, 9 jiao, and 3 fen in national currency.</p>
<p>Yesterday's receipts of 752 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen have not yet been included. The titles of the donating gentlemen are also omitted due to space limitations and will be published successively. We respectfully hope for your understanding. Among the industrial and commercial circles in our country, there are indeed those who accurately record the book value of their property, but there are many cases where it does not match the actual value, and the discrepancy is quite large. Now that the government's income tax is about to be implemented, if this continues without rectification, those who record values lower than the actual value will pay more taxes, affecting their business. Those who record values higher than the actual value are suspected of tax evasion, which is not permitted by law. Therefore, estimating the accuracy of original assets and obtaining appropriate proof from a third party is a matter of utmost urgency. The United Notary Public Office at No. 505, Henan Road, in this city, has long served society with public appraisal services and has an outstanding reputation. It is said that the office has experts from various industries and accepts this kind of commission to serve the people of the country.</p>

The guests were particularly crowded that day, and the exhibition, which was originally scheduled to close at 7:00 PM, was extended by an hour due to the lingering guests, demonstrating the large number of art lovers.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Sun Lantian took over the New Stage, he originally hired the Fu Liancheng troupe to perform in the south. However, the Tianjin China Grand Theater insisted on retaining the troupe, so the southern performance was temporarily postponed. The New Stage, out of camaraderie, first hired the Xin De She to perform in Shanghai. Although the Xin De She is new to the Shanghai audience, every time they performed in the Tianjin area, they drew huge crowds. This is because the members of the troupe are all beautiful and talented, captivating the people of Tianjin and Hebei. Currently, the troupe, led by Li Jiayun and Bi Yuhua, consists of over a hundred female performers and has arrived in Shanghai. After a brief rest, they will take the stage around the 25th of this month, presenting their signature Peking Opera and modern dramas to the Shanghai audience. At that time, the Niuzhuang Road will be bustling with traffic, and there will surely be a grand scene.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Letter <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>To the editor: Having read in your newspaper's foreign news column, "A paper box shop east of the new county jail in Dongmen Nei, Changshu, was careless, causing a fire that spread to as many as nine households, and two firefighters died. It is also reported that when the fire was raging, the prisoners in the west end rioted and one opium addict escaped," this is slightly inconsistent with the facts. On the 14th of this month (this month) at around 10:00 AM, the paper box suddenly burst into flames, and at the time of the fire, the tenants detained in this office did indeed have a situation of relying on the crowd to cause a riot in an attempt to escape. Fortunately, the members were able to protect them effectively, and no accidents occurred, and no one escaped. The report in your newspaper is probably based on an unverified interview, and I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, so I have specifically written this letter to correct it, and I ask that it be published in the "Letters" column. Please give my regards to the editor of the Shenbao. Bei Ding, Custodian and Warden of Changshu County Prison, November 16th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: In the second edition of the Shanghai Shenbao supplement of October 25, there was an article entitled "The Secret Communications of Lixiao," which stated that "Emperor Shunzhi of China is now revered as the ancestor by 'Lixiao'" and "Lixiao in China also has a tendency to decline day by day. This highest organization is even more out of the question," which is inconsistent with the facts. Our founder of Lixiao is Mr. Yang Lairu. Since Yang Zu founded the Yi Lixiao religion, it has been in the world for three hundred years, with the mission of saving the nation from danger and rescuing social hearts. Now Lixiao has spread all over the world, all from the same line of Yang Zu. Except for Yang Zu, there is no so-called ancestor. According to legend, Emperor Shunzhi of the former Qing Dynasty once entered Lixiao because he was touched by the development of Lixiao, which was unfavorable to the Manchu Qing regime. Therefore, he did not hesitate to join Lixiao in the hope of changing the ideological propositions of our Lixiao, but because there are so many people in Lixiao and the organization is secret, it can be said that it is rarely affected by it. The doctrines that Lixiao now believes in are as consistent as a string of coins, which is proof. Since this association was approved by the central government in the 24th year (of the Republic, 1935), it has made every effort to promote the doctrines of Lixiao and promote the work of advising against smoking and drinking. Lixiao organizations in various places are also making every effort to organize and promote it. Now that the statement is untrue, I am sincerely afraid of confusing the hearing, and I hope to be given the favor of correcting it. Please give my regards to the editor of the Shanghai Shenbao, and I wish you well. The China Lixiao General Association, November 19th.</p>

<p>3. Establishment of China Oil Lamp Company—The company was initiated by Mr. Chen Gongbo and others, with an approved capital of 150,000 yuan. It is estimated that the actual amount received has reached 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. It is a limited company organization, with Mr. Kong Yongzhi as chairman of the board and Mr. Chen Zuyi as general manager, specializing in the manufacture of various lamp oils. They have applied for a five-year patent, with the main factory located at No. 162, Lane 503, Huade Road, and a branch factory on the edge of Zhougong Temple, Santiaoshi, Tianjin. The main factory employs more than 200 workers and can produce 3,000 lamps of oil per day, with wide sales.</p>
<p>4. Clearance Sale of the Guangming Electric Appliance Thermos Bottle Company—The company was established in the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), with an original capital of 180,000 yuan in national currency. It is a limited company organization, with Mr. Lei Binglin as chairman of the board and Mr. Liang Bozhi as manager. The factory is located on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, specializing in the manufacture of thermos bottle liners and glass electrical appliances. It employs more than 200 workers. In the past, the business was quite considerable, but after the January 28 Incident, the entire equipment of the factory was destroyed, resulting in huge losses. Later, after a board meeting, it was decided to reduce the capital to 112,000 yuan to reorganize and resume business. However, in the face of the current recession, it is not easy to maintain. Therefore, in May of this year, it temporarily announced a shutdown. On June 14, a shareholders' meeting resolved to sell the factory's entire property, accounts, assets, trademarks, etc., to Xinghua Company for operation. The handover was not actually carried out until this month.</p>
<p>The above are the important changes in the manufacturing industry in August. As for the sales aspect, the closure of the China Xingye National Goods Company is particularly noteworthy. The company only opened in April of this year and announced its liquidation after only four months of operation, which shows that it is not easy to operate industry and commerce at present. (End)</p>

Regarding higher education, because the directly administered colleges and universities are directly surveyed, the procedures are simple, and statistics have been compiled up to the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). For the school education and social education under the jurisdiction of various provinces and cities, because there are many county districts under the jurisdiction of the provinces, the procedures are time-consuming. Therefore, the survey materials for secondary education, primary education, and social education in various provinces and cities nationwide are now complete and have been completed for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933).

<p>The eighth Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Competition of the Municipal No. 1 Sports Field closed registration on October 31st. A total of 56 teams registered to participate. The field has only one football field, and the number of teams is too large to be allocated, so the newly-added Huichang team has decided not to accept. The old members of Guanshengruzhi team, totaling 56 teams, have been carefully reviewed and divided into four groups according to their skill levels: "Unity," "Congealing," "Essence," and "Spirit," with 14 teams in each group. The teams will be summoned to the field at 9 a.m. this Sunday (the 22nd) to draw lots. Each major group will be divided into two subgroups, i.e., seven teams in each group, to hold a single round-robin tournament. After the competition, the champions of the same group will be scheduled for another final to determine the winner. It is hoped that each team will send a representative (no separate letters will be sent) to the field on time to draw lots for the grouping. It is also reported that the competition will begin from 1:30 p.m. on the 27th and 28th of this month (Saturday).</p>

<p>The awards ceremony for the fourth Municipal Sports Meet of this city was held yesterday at 2 p.m. in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Director Pan represented the mayor in giving instructions and awards. Participants included Section Chief Zhang, Field Director Shao, Director Wang, and more than 200 representatives from various schools. Those who have not received awards will be notified separately by the bureau to collect them. The details of the awards ceremony are recorded below.</p>
<p>Director's Speech: The ceremony began with Director Pan giving a speech, stating that today is the awards ceremony for the fourth Municipal Sports Meet of this city. The mayor could not attend due to other engagements and is represented by him. He had a few points to report to everyone. The conference started on October 22nd and was originally scheduled for three days. Due to too many programs, it was extended for half a day and completely ended on the morning of the 25th. Because there was no time to award prizes on the spot, the ceremony was postponed to today. A total of 1,300 athletes from 139 schools participated in the track and field competitions, and 18 teams from 14 schools participated in the group competitions. During the conference, the spirit of the athletes from various schools was still good, and no disputes occurred, which was commendable. However, there was no progress in terms of results, which is what we hope everyone will strive for. This time, many parties have donated a lot of prizes. Therefore, in addition to the team awards, individuals who score more than 5 points will receive prizes as encouragement. However, the real purpose of sports is not prizes, but to strengthen the physique and contribute to the country. Now that the national crisis is serious and the nation is facing danger, everyone should double their efforts in physical training. After the speech, the awards were presented.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Director Pan's Speech: The Relationship Between Physical Education and Hygiene Education at the Municipal Physical Education College <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau of this city, was invited by the Municipal Physical Education College on the 9th of this month to attend the weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the school and give a speech. The topic of his speech was "The Relationship Between Physical Education and Hygiene Education." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Distinguished teachers, dear students, today I am here to attend the Municipal Physical Education College's weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It can be said that this is my first time visiting the school and speaking to you all. At the same time, I am very happy to see that the school is in good spirits.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Mayor Wu, our municipal government has been unanimously promoting and encouraging national physical education, especially among young people. This year, the performance of our country's delegation at the World Games was poor because our physical strength could not compete with others, resulting in our lagging far behind in all sports. Everyone felt very ashamed. At the same time, we believe that if the physical fitness of the general public in such a large country is improved, we will naturally occupy a place in international sports competitions. Therefore, the mayor made a grand wish to establish a Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College, intending to build it into a relatively perfect and ideal physical education school in the country, to cultivate physical education talents, to train physical education teachers, and to promote and accelerate the development of general physical education in the country. You must all have long understood the fundamental meaning of establishing this school.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about today is the relationship between physical education and hygiene education.</p>
<p>Our promotion of physical education is not only focused on sports and the progress of competition results, but fundamentally on improving the physical strength and prolonging the lifespan of the general public, so that they can shoulder more burdensome work and do more things to seek happiness for the entire country and nation. If we first pay attention to the achievements of athletes, then at best, we will only cultivate a very small number of athletes, and the majority of the people will still not have healthy bodies. What help is that to the entire nation? Moreover, if the general physical fitness of the people does not meet the standard, it is a dream to have outstanding athletes who can compete with other countries. The current situation in our country is that the physical strength of the general public is not as good as that of others. Therefore, there are fewer people who can shoulder work than others, which has led to the state of being called the "sick man of East Asia." In the midst of such serious national difficulties, each of us should do the work of two people, and the work of one day should be equivalent to the work of two days. To achieve this goal, we must all promote physical education, hoping that every member of the entire nation will have a healthy physique to shoulder extraordinary work. At the same time, if the standard of physical strength can be developed to above the international level, then we can naturally win a considerable position in the competition, without having to force it.</p>
<p>I always have a feeling that physical education is a part of hygiene education—that is, health education. Physical education and hygiene are truly inseparable.</p>
<p>Speaking of physical education methods and types of sports, I am a complete layman. However, from an educational point of view, there seem to be many areas that are worth studying. In the future, you will be responsible for training central school students. You must study their physical strength, temperament, and personality separately, and you cannot stick to rigid methods. You must know that the purpose of physical education is to make people healthier from unhealthy, and less sick from sick. If the method is not suitable, and you force it to be implemented in a rigid way, in fact, while some people can achieve considerable progress, perhaps others will not only not progress because they exceed the limit, but also affect their physical health. I hope that comrades engaged in physical education will not only examine it from the practical perspective, but also work hard from the research perspective. Do not think that various methods and projects are always "what others have, I have," and "what others say, I say," without being willing to conduct any research. The Municipal Physical Education College should adopt a research and experimental attitude, and use methods and equipment to improve ourselves. Use good methods and improve bad ones in order to test out a training program that is suitable for the needs of the whole country to increase the efficiency of progress. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The yarn market is rising sharply with good momentum. This is because Osaka Grade Three Yarn soared by six yuan and three jiao, and there are rumors that there is labor unrest in the Qingdao yarn factory. As a result, people are increasingly bullish, and there is an urgent need to cover short positions. Market prices are advancing steadily. Although the yarn sales market is still mediocre, buyers' intentions are very strong. Some are slightly throwing out when prices rise due to the rampant banditry in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Rebounds Strongly</p>
<p>The auction yarn market opened lower due to sluggish yarn sales the previous day and weak sentiment. Prices for each month fell by seven jiao to one yuan. After the first round, news of Osaka Grade Three Yarn being strong spread. This month is entering a good phase, and floating accounts are being covered. Market prices rebounded. At the same time, spot yarn business is more active than yesterday. However, some who have profited a lot are spitting out. As a result, prices for each month rose by eight or nine jiao to one yuan and one jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon session opened with Osaka Grade Three Yarn climbing step by step, and there were various rumors saying that labor unrest had also occurred in a Qingdao yarn factory. Short sellers were especially eager to cover. Market prices soared. As a result, prices for each month rose by another two yuan to three yuan compared to the morning session price. It was found that 1,600 bales of Changfeng, 1,250 bales of Yichang, 1,500 bales of Taichang, 2,000 bales of Minghua, 3,300 bales of Gengfeng, 2,000 bales of Changji, 2,400 bales of Senkang, 1,800 bales of Shenji, 1,900 bales of Yuda, 1,550 bales of Changji, 850 bales of Yuchang, 950 bales of Fengtai, 900 bales of Dachang, 100 bales of Yuanda, and 800 bales of Fukang were sold. 1,000 bales of Juxing, 3,250 bales of Yuda, 2,300 bales of Dachangcheng, 4,300 bales of Runkang, 1,750 bales of Jinchang, 1,700 bales of Mingde, 1,150 bales of Changyu, 1,150 bales of Yicheng, and 1,500 bales of Tonghe were bought. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Slightly More Active</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still normal. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 800 bales throughout the day, and the selling price rose by two yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 305 Guangdong: 71 Tianjin: 405</p>
<p>Hankou: 30 Wuhu: 5 Sichuan: 02</p>
<p>Counterparts: 010</p>
<h3 id="e161">Lack of New Chips This Month, Cotton Prices Also Rising Sharply <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market has been boosted by the yarn market, and because the price difference between cotton and yarn is too large, the number of buyers has slightly increased. However, the situation of overseas American cotton is very sluggish. Another theory is that trains on the Longhai Railway are unable to transport in time, so the amount of cotton arriving in Shanghai may be reduced. Therefore, there are many activities, and the market situation is slightly tight due to the lack of new chips this month.</p>
<p>Auction Cotton Rises by Five to Six Jiao</p>
<p>The auction cotton market opened lower, although American cotton fell, the market sentiment was still good. Because the date of delivery this month is approaching, short sellers lack new chips to resolve, and the cloth market is becoming stronger, driving up long-term prices. After the second round, the market situation is still high due to the good yarn market and the short sellers actively covering their positions. As a result, prices for each month rose by two and a half jiao to four and a half jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon session opened and rose with the yarn market, but in the second round, rumors of labor unrest spread, and Osaka yarn prices were rising, while cotton prices fell by three and a half jiao, and people's hearts were at peace, so there was a callback. By the time of closing, the rising power of the yarn market was getting stronger, driving up the price again. As a result, prices for each month rose by five fen to two jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 2,000 dan of Xiecheng, 3,300 dan of Dachangcheng, 3,700 dan of Hengyi, 2,400 dan of Dafeng, 3,700 dan of Yuanda, 2,500 dan of Daqing, 1,400 dan of Gengfeng, 3,800 dan of Changyu, 4,500 dan of Taichang, 5,000 dan of Yichang, 2,600 dan of Shengyuan, 4,800 dan of Xinchang, 5,900 dan of Jinchang, 1,600 dan of Yongda, and 1,600 dan of Xincheng were sold. 2,000 dan of Tongfu, 1,900 dan of Senkang, 2,600 dan of Hengde, 1,600 dan of Guangyuan, 8,100 dan of Runkang, 10,400 dan of Fukang, 1,300 dan of Yuda, 2,800 dan of Fengtai, 6,200 dan of Dachang, 5,200 dan of Yuanxingchang, and 13,100 dan of Changhe were bought. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Private Transactions of American Cotton Decrease <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of American cotton rose or fell by one to two pounds. The market situation was sluggish. Although there was a need for December futures from counterparts and short accounts, many longs were settled and sold short. The cloth market continued to be active, and spot cotton prices were firm. However, private transactions decreased significantly due to uncertainty in exports and government policies. Before the close, the December futures market turned soft due to long liquidations. Spot prices fell by ten pounds, and futures fell by eight to twelve pounds. English cotton spot goods were one point short, and futures were not recommended. Indian cotton exporters bought Omla, and speculators sold. Pingle rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Omla rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Bailuo remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 18th)</p>
<p>Also, a telegram from Mumbai predicted that at the opening on the 19th, Bai Zaxi would be 216.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees, Omla would be 197 rupees, down 1 rupee, and Pingle would be 158 rupees, down 1.5 rupees.</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 18th stated that the Hill Zhi Company's estimate of ginned cotton for this season is 10,609,000 bales, up from 9,871,000 bales in the previous report (November 6).</p>
<h3 id="e164">Grade Three Yarn Rises by More Than Six Yuan <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Osaka on the 19th stated that Grade Three futures yarn rose by one yuan and five jiao to six yuan and three jiao. Near-month contracts were 244.5 yuan, and far-month contracts were 214 yuan. Cotton futures fell by five fen to five jiao. Near-month contracts were 65.05 yuan, and far-month contracts were 66.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall, Actual Sales Gradually Expanding in All Directions, Spot Goods Feel Quite Scarce <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw Grade Three Yarn prices soaring, and auction yarn and cotton in the exchange also became uniformly expensive. People's hearts in this city became more determined, and the market situation was stable. It was easy for the price of all goods to rise, but difficult for them to fall. Spot goods for unbleached cotton cloth were the most scarce. Eastern goods, fine cloth, and fine twill were not selling as well. Spot goods were one jiao to one and a half jiao more expensive (per piece) than warehouse orders. Fine materials were selling quickly. Although the output of local factories was high, there was still a shortage of supply due to the continued strong demand from the Yangtze River gang and the dyeing factory inland gang. Market prices also rose by about five fen to one jiao (per piece). Fine cloth from Chinese factories was gradually increasing production again, but the selling price was no less expensive than that of Eastern goods. White twill and flannel had once softened a week ago, but recently, due to the scarcity of spot goods, the market trend suddenly became expensive again. Printed flannel, blue cloth, coarse cloth, and other goods were uniformly firm. Actual sales were gradually expanding, with the Yangtze River and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces being the most prominent. Due to the approaching sales season, the prices of lower-grade thick cloth have risen sharply, so each factory has gradually decided to raise prices. The prices of lower-grade Lun Chang factory Qiankun Yin and Qingfeng factory Juesheng brands have increased by one or two jiao (per piece).</p>
<h3 id="e166">Overcoats are in Season, Taking Advantage of the Trend to Rise <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Sales of overcoats have become increasingly brisk recently. Plain colors, twill patterns, full wool, and water wave cloud head embossed overcoats. Inside and outside warehouse inventories have continued to decrease, and the trend has turned lively. The prices of all goods have risen uniformly. Baoda's number one twill pattern overcoat is sold for seven yuan for wholesale cash transactions, and number two is six and a half yuan. Huabo's full wool is five yuan, and 505 plain camel color is five yuan and two and a half jiao. Ordinary Polish cloud head embossed overcoats are four yuan and five jiao for double-sided and three yuan and three jiao for single-sided. All require bank drafts and cash for delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yuanfang Piece Goods Sales are Stagnant <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday, and the local Yuanfang Foreign Company held its 3015th auction. Four types of goods were displayed: Western satin, yuan velvet, tribute woolen cloth, and yuan silk. There were 46 brands, totaling 72 boxes. In terms of market conditions, only the Changsha buyers were active, and the rest were lackluster. Sales on the street were stagnant, and calling prices varied, with flatness and fatigue dominating. The price of 45 brands of Western satin decreased by several fen compared to the previous period. The price of both brands of yuan velvet decreased by three or four fen. The price of tribute woolen cloth was flat. The price of yuan silk increased by one yuan and two American jiao for the Yuanzhu brand and seven jiao for the Mei Zhang brand. The price of the San Yuan Di Bozi Haitian brand increased by four or five jiao, the price of the San Jun brand increased by half a yuan, and the price of the An Dian Bao brand decreased by seven jiao. The price of the Cai Bashi brand decreased by five jiao. The prices of the rest only increased or decreased by one or two jiao, but the majority were flat. Red and blue foreign cloth from foreign countries had not arrived, so it was not included in this period.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Grain: Fujin Gang Spot Transactions, Flour Prices Rise More Sharply, Speculation Resumes Hoarding, Prices Rise Frequently by Three or Four Fen <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for each month rose uniformly again. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, Canada, and others, differed by about one jiao. However, because the situation in Suiyuan was tightening and the accumulation of food was an inevitable trend, the market sentiment was strong. Flour was suitable for sales in the north, and the speculative market was also prone to hoarding, so as soon as the opening price was announced, rumors spread, and buying interest surged. The asking price for each month secretly increased by two or three fen. The price increase for this month was even sharper due to factory covering and slight movement in actual sales. The market sentiment was even better when the afternoon session opened (it was reported that Fuxin opened spot goods for 30,000 to 40,000 Tianjin deliveries, priced at 3.87 yuan, causing the opening price to rise by one or two fen). Then, buying interest slightly stopped, and some longs returned. After observing, if the situation is not good, the market is still expected to be stable.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Futures Wheat Boosts Flour Market, Spot Prices Also Rise by Five Fen <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the futures wheat market, prices for each month showed an initial flattening and then rising trend after the opening of the morning session. At the opening price, the rise and fall of Indian and foreign wheat differed by about one jiao. The opening price for this month was still stable, but starting from December, the flour market had a sharp rise in prices, so the market sentiment followed closely. The opening price for each month rose by five or six fen, and then the price tended to fluctuate slightly. The transaction was very smooth when the afternoon session opened, and the price turned stable. Considering the domestic environment, it is not easy to see the market loosen. However, rice prices are still flat and will not rise excessively. In the spot wheat market, prices for each grade rose by five fen due to the uniform rise in standards. The opening price for Shandong Dali Ji wheat was 6.1 yuan, Huangqiao wheat was 6.1 yuan, Shaoxing wheat was 6.1 yuan, Xiashi wheat was 5.88 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 6.05 yuan, and Puzhen wheat was 5.94 yuan, with 3,000 bales handled by Shenda.</p>

<p>Recently, the soybean cake sales market has been particularly lively. Spot cakes have inland sales markets, and fixed-term transactions are becoming popular again with the Shantou gang, so the market is quite firm. Yesterday, Changde Factory opened four brands of spot cakes with 1,300 pieces, priced at 1.83 yuan. Dada Xinchang Kai opened four brands, priced at 1.82 yuan. Dachang New Factory opened four brands, priced at 1.81 yuan, and opened four brands to order 10,000 pieces within December, priced at 1.82 yuan. At the moment, the selling prices of cakes from each factory are very different. What is happening here cannot be measured by outsiders, nor can it be hidden by both hands.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Sesame Has Little Supply <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Trust Bureau purchased 350 tons of foreign sesame (priced at 12.8 jiao), the situation has become tight. Due to insufficient chips to supply demand, foreign firms such as Dafu and Mitsui have also begun to purchase, causing market prices to rise again. It had been priced at 12.85 yuan a hundred tons yesterday and the day before. Yesterday, another 150 tons were transacted, priced at 13 yuan. Cargo owners are still selling less, so the previous session is still promising. Because factories want to suppress soy beans, they are less excited. Yesterday, only seven cars of Siping Street beans were purchased by the factory. The market was slightly quiet, and other scattered transactions totaled 1,400 to 1,500 bales of various beans.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Ke Xian Arrives Sparsely, Sales Still Strong <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice arrivals and sales were balanced, and the market was stable. However, Machine Yuan rice has been purchased smoothly by the local customers for several days, and the market has turned lively. In addition to smooth purchases on the street yesterday, Guangzhou and Shantou gangs also purchased and loaded. The total transaction volume for the day was more than 4,000 bales, and the price also rose slightly by three or four fen. Other Machine Coarse and various rice customer sales were less, and the market was still similar to the previous day. The trade believes that because Henan and Dajin have continued to sell recently, the source has been reduced, and the market may have to move toward scarcity in the future. Today, 1,822 bales of Jiangxi rice, 1,250 bales of Xiang rice, 700 bales of Shashi rice, 1,055 bales of Wen Tai rice, and 2,120 bales of Yongjiang Yuan rice were offered.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the gang's source totaled more than 60 numbers, with a total of 12,300 to 12,400 shi. Of these, Bo Dao accounted for two-thirds, so although Bo Dao's market was continued to be purchased by the customer's gang, with more than 6,000 bales, the result was flat, and the market did not rise or fall. Ben Street sales of Hou Geng turned sluggish, and only 200 bales were purchased by the gang, resulting in a situation of obvious stability and hidden fatigue in the market. Du Yang Jian did not rise or fall, and the lack of yin changes was slightly.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few ships coming from the river, totaling 25 or 26. The market was quiet. The weather cleared, and customer demand weakened. The price of new Geng was flat and fatigued, and the price of Yang Du Bu Jian was loose by three or four fen. Jinbang for Bo Dao was slightly active. Sales on the street were still acceptable, and the price of high and medium grades was stable. The price of Jue Bo Dao and early rice was soft, and the price of yin changes was firm. The sales of customer-specific Jian were flat, and the price was moderate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market on the China Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly rebounded, and the rise was very strong. The war in Suiyuan is still in stalemate, but the long companies that lost the previous session suddenly declared failure. Their hearts were still unwilling, so they resumed their efforts to pull up the price. Short sellers temporarily avoided the sharp edge, and the buyers suddenly declared victory. Or, it is said that large investors have been secretly selling while openly buying, because after large investors actually buy, they often want to change the account to other brokers. Yesterday, after many parties raised prices, the trend was almost rising throughout the day. At the opening of the morning session, all prices rose uniformly. No. 34, 35, and 77, etc., were bought the most, and market prices rose uniformly by one to two jiao to three and a half jiao. The number of accounts for the final transaction was very active. No. 34, 44, and 54, etc., successively bought in, and then rose by one jiao to three and a half jiao. However, No. 5, 10, 32, and 35, etc., all sold out. The opening of the afternoon session saw retail investors buying again, and No. 4 also had needs. No. 6 and 32 sold out, and the amount was still relatively substantial. However, because retail investors were buying vigorously, prices rose again by one jiao to three and a half jiao. The closing was slightly chaotic, with only one or two slightly lower by about one jiao, and the rest still rising by five fen, one jiao to three jiao. No. 22 and 66 bought a lot. According to the evening newspaper news, the war was won, and the bond market may still have a rise. The market price resulted in a uniform rebound of three jiao to nine jiao. The total transaction volume was 8.57 million yuan. The results of the price increase and decrease are compared in the table below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was still stable, and it was easy to recover in the middle of the session. However, as the settlement price of pure gold was approaching, the buying interest was high and easy to decline. As a result, the price fell slightly by three jiao. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a contraction in the UK and flatness in the US. The price of large bars was said to have a trend of mass supply after the close. Although there were short positions to cover, it still fell below 0.625. The forward silver price in Montevideo shrank by four to seven hundredths, and the exchange rate rose slightly. The London raw gold contracted by one penny. The announcement of the Central Bank's price was flat in both the UK and the US, and the customs gold unit did not move. The standard price of auction gold was listed as 1,156.8 yuan, which was slightly lower at the morning opening. After the opening, many parties were selling out, and short sellers also came to add positions and continued to fall. However, there were still many who maintained the price at the low, and it once rebounded. Many parties continued to close out. The announcement of HSBC's listing price was flat in both the UK and the US, and the balance tax for silver was reduced by half a point. There were no changes in the middle of the session, and it was still slightly soft. The afternoon was extremely peaceful. The market suddenly turned stable again after the market opened, and continued to rise. However, many parties sold out. Although the supply was small, there was a lack of buyers, and the price gradually fell back. The Indian silver newspaper shrank by seven Anna. After falling low, it was pulled up again. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The closing price was 1,155.5 yuan. Yuan Mao, Yongda, Decheng, Tongfeng, Henglai entered, rising to 5.7 yuan.

There were 5,250 strips of January futures, totaling thirty-three long companies and fifteen short companies. The total number of transactions was 336 in the morning and 238 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Although the Market Price of Hardware Zinc Sheets is High, the Listed Price Has Fallen <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Zinc sheets are in short supply due to active procurement by battery factories, cigarette factories, and others, causing prices to rise several times a day. For example, No. 1 is priced at 145 yuan, No. 4 at 150 yuan, No. 5 and No. 6 at 155 yuan, and No. 7 at 138 yuan.

<h3 id="e177">Concerns About the Future of the U.S. Dollar: Chinese Merchants Have Been Selling for Days <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw a slight rise in exchange rates. Although banks were bullish, Chinese merchants continued to sell, keeping the market stable. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams indicated that in London, both near and far term contracts showed a tendency towards increased supply after the market closed, with the price dropping below 0.0625, prompting short covering. The New York silver market remained unchanged. London forward silver prices fell by 4 to 7 points. London gold fell by one penny. Sterling rose 25 points against the U.S. dollar and 2 pounds against the French franc. The U.S. dollar rose 25 points against both sterling and the French franc. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both sterling and the U.S. dollar remaining stable. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. At the opening of the exchange market in the morning, the near-term selling price for sterling was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5/625, and for the U.S. dollar, it was 19.625 and 6875, a slight increase compared to the previous close, indicating stability for both sterling and the U.S. dollar. After the opening, Chinese merchants continued to liquidate their positions, while Japanese banks sold East Asian currencies. HSBC's official rates were announced, with both sterling and the U.S. dollar remaining stable. Although banks were bullish, the market remained stable. Later, after the announcement of the silver equalization tax reduction by half, the banks' appetite for supply remained uneven. Japanese banks engaged in arbitrage, selling sterling and buying the U.S. dollar. Throughout the process, the market fluctuated. Later in the day, Chinese merchants again sold U.S. dollars, which foreign banks worked hard to maintain, keeping the overall trend stable. The Indian silver report showed a decrease of seven annas, but ultimately remained unchanged. By the close of trading, the near-term selling price for sterling was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5615, and for the U.S. dollar, it was 29.62 and 6875, indicating a balanced supply of both near and far-term contracts for sterling and the U.S. dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants continued to sell U.S. dollars, while banks remained bullish. Shanghai, however, bought U.S. dollars. The trading record for today is as follows:</p>
<p>The opening near-term selling price for sterling was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5625. Banque Belge bought spot at 9375. Holland China Trading Company bought January at 5315. Jardine Matheson bought spot at 59375. (Arbitrage between sterling and Japanese yen was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 32/1). The afternoon near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5625. Later, HSBC bought January at 9325. The closing selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5625 for spot, 53125 and 5625 for December, half a penny and 53125 for January, and 46875 and half a penny for February, with the buying price slightly higher.</p>
<p>The opening near-term actual prices for the U.S. dollar were 29.625 and 6875. Mackellar &amp; Co. bought December at 625. Shanghai sold spot at 6875. Mackellar &amp; Co. bought January at 5625. Shanghai sold spot to Mackellar &amp; Co. at 6875. The afternoon closing near-term selling prices were 29.625 and 6875. Later, Banque Belge and Mackellar &amp; Co. bought March at 4375. Mackellar &amp; Co. took delivery of December at 625. Shanghai sold spot at 6875. The closing actual prices were 29.625 and 6875 for spot, 625 for December, 5625 for January, and half a dollar for February, with the buying price increased by 062.</p>
<p>The Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate was conducted by Mitsui, who sold yen and bought sterling at a spot rate of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 03125.</p>

<p>Yesterday, silk trading in Shanghai suddenly experienced extraordinary activity, leading to some market volatility. Initially, due to slight weakness in overseas silk prices the previous day, local sentiment feared a retracement after the surge. Consequently, manufacturers telegraphed offers to sell abroad in large quantities, but at prices that were not excessively high, bringing the buying and selling prices fairly close. Furthermore, as of yesterday morning, actual sales in the silk markets of Japan and the United States improved, and silk prices rose sharply (New York spot prices rose by 6 cents, and futures rose by 7.5 cents, averaging approximately 29 yuan per picul in Shanghai; Yokohama spot prices rose to the 900 yuan mark, and futures also rose by 24 yuan). As a result, silk offers were telegraphed and sold as expected. At the same time, Western merchants also absorbed silk strongly, leading to brisk sales. A total of 1,114 bales were traded today. Unfortunately, market prices were not very uniform. Looking at silk prices in Shanghai, the 20 yuan decline from the previous day has already been recovered yesterday, and even surpassed. Yesterday, only 15 bales of User silk were traded. However, the total domestic and foreign silk sales throughout the day can be described as unprecedented this year, which was also quite unexpected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market saw a slight increase in activity. Sales of Zhen Mei green tea from Tunxi and Shexian began to pick up again in France. Companies such as Long Yong Xing Hua Tea and Duder &amp; Co. started searching for supplies, with over 300 cases sold. Road Zhuang’s core-extracted goods were offered at 75 to 84 yuan, while Zhuang goods were offered at 44 to 45 yuan, and local Zhuang goods were offered at 30 yuan. Prices all tended to stabilize. In addition, there were scattered sales of Needle Mei Pearl Tea and other goods, it is said.</p>

<p>— Chu Yang</p>
<p>I enjoy watching plays, but I'm not particularly fond of reading scripts. In my opinion, it's best to let the concrete images and actions unfold on the stage, which is more interesting and makes more sense. Although there are some plays in literary history that are both interesting and make sense, they are never performed. However, I believe the success of a play should be determined by "the effect of the performance." This evaluation is best based on the play's impact and resonance with the audience. Some may argue that "civilized plays" appeal to certain audiences, making them cheer and applaud. How should we evaluate these plays? In fact, the impact of "civilized plays" on audiences, regardless of their social class, is objectively negative. Xia Yan's play "Sai Jinhua" has already been staged. In preparation for seeing the play, I read the script. I should have read this script earlier, as it had already sparked heated debate in the theatrical and literary circles.</p>
<p>Using the historical Boxer Rebellion as a subject for a play is worthwhile. "Sai Jinhua" is an extremely dramatic figure, making her a compelling protagonist. Some have questioned whether the author focuses on the Boxer Rebellion or on Sai Jinhua herself. Some believe that the theme is not clear. I believe the theme is neither exclusively the former nor the latter, and it doesn't seem to have "two themes." If the Boxer Rebellion were the theme, the development of the historical events of the Boxer Rebellion would have to be the focus, showing its causes, consequences, and significance. The protagonist could not be "a girl from this troupe," even if she "shook the hand of Empress Frederick" (as stated in the play) and "slept with German Field Marshal Waldersee for some time" (as stated by Lu Xun). If the latter were the theme, the tragedy of this woman in the play is not developed to its full potential, and historical events and figures are interspersed and float to the surface. So, is this play a social history drama or a personal tragedy? The author's own answer is the most appropriate: "a satirical historical drama." He aims to "depict a gallery of portraits of lackeys set against the backdrop of the Boxer Rebellion, attempting to place everyone from Sai Jinhua to Wei Bangxian within the focal point of the narrative." The author's main target is the betrayers of China. Because he lived in a besieged city in northern China for two months, hearing stories about the chaos of thirty-seven years ago, he was reminded of the current situation. "So he wanted to expose the ugliness of the betrayers and awaken public awareness of 'national defense within our borders.' He used the figures of those who were active in this besieged city and transposed them onto figures from around the time of the Boxer Rebellion to write a play of a satirical nature" (Xia Yan, "A Letter to the Performers," published in the inaugural issue of "Literary Circle"). This is the author's stated motivation for writing the play. Although the play does not directly address "national defense within our borders," it does indeed use the ugly behavior and shameless acts of treason of the betrayers of China during the Boxer Rebellion to satirize the reality of the present. Therefore, we can define the theme of the play as: using historical satire to oppose national betrayal. I believe this is the correct interpretation of the author's intention, and the play's "national defense" significance lies therein.</p>
<p>The most superficial misinterpretation is to regard Sai Jinhua as a national hero, a great historical figure, a patriot, and a benefactor of the people of Beijing. No wonder Lu Xun's last testament did not forget to satirize: "Drama has already found its 'most central theme': even Sai Jinhua, who slept with the German Field Marshal Waldersee during the Boxer Rebellion, has long been canonized as the Nine Heavens Protector Goddess" (see "This Is Also Life" in the inaugural issue of "Zhongliu"). Lu Xun was satirizing those who regarded Sai Jinhua as the "Nine Heavens Protector Goddess," and clearly not the author, because the author's "most central theme" was not to praise Sai Jinhua, but to oppose the betrayers. He did not portray the female protagonist as a "national hero," but explicitly wrote about a woman who "used her body to win the enemy's favor and prolong her life in a chaotic world." However, she retained more humanity than those "who sat high in the halls of power, scowling at their compatriots but groveling before the enemy." Therefore, he "only wanted to portray her as an ordinary woman, commonly seen in China then and now, containing all the weaknesses common to all women. To depict her character as truthfully as possible, hoping to show that she merely played a role in this tragic era due to a chance opportunity" (quoted from Xia Yan's letter above). The sympathy the author has for her is something his female protagonist may not understand. Old Sai Jinhua might think the great master who gave her ten yuan was sympathizing with her.</p>
<p>Understanding Sai Jinhua in this way does not diminish this "Guanyin who saved thousands upon thousands of lives with a single word!" Regarding the significance of historical figures, we should, along with the playwright, grasp the authenticity of his protagonist (is it not enough? Or is it exaggerated?). We may as well sympathize with her, but certainly not treat her as the "Nine Heavens Protector Goddess," like the people of Beijing did thirty-seven years ago. We should see Sai Jinhua as the center of historical satire. "In times of great national upheaval, it is not the high-ranking officials who can truly speak for the people, but a beautiful young woman like her!" (as stated in the play). This is enough satire of the incompetence of the Qing officials! The fact that things that "High Minister" cannot handle rely on Sai Jinhua selling a little face to foreigners exhausts the artistry of satire.</p>
<p>The script of "Sai Jinhua" is not without its flaws. Although I don't understand playwriting and theatrical techniques, I feel that the development of the plot and the flow of scenes are not very good. The scenes are too scattered, and the tone of the play lacks unity. Perhaps it would be better adapted into a movie. This remains to be seen depending on the success of the performance. The definitive thing is that the personalities of the characters other than the protagonist and two or three others (Li Hongzhang, Sun Jiading, Wei Bangxian) are too cartoonish (Waldersee is also the same). This can be supplemented somewhat if the director directs well during the performance. As for the "Boxers" reflected in the play, only the bad and violent aspects are written, while the expression of the just and anti-imperialist feelings of the Chinese people at that time is ignored. This shows the author's lack of a deeper understanding and expression of historical truth. Overall, although the historical significance of this play is not as great as "The Initial European Flag" and "Roar, China!", and the satirical significance is not as perfect and fully integrated throughout the play as Gogol's "The Inspector General," it is still a powerful work in Chinese playwriting. It is still an initial achievement in both historical and satirical drama, and no one can deny that it deserves a considerable evaluation in the realm of national defense drama.</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Leap year, presidential election year, November 1936. Franklin Roosevelt was once again propelled by the voters onto the White House, a monarch without a dynasty but with a limited term, all due to diligence. Eugene O'Neill was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, a combination of fame and fortune, by the Nobel Prize Committee later in the same month. (Perhaps the reason for awarding him the Nobel Prize this time is not the same as the reason for awarding it to Bunin in the previous two years, because O'Neill was able to maintain the old American style.) November 1936 was an unusual month and an unusual year for easily moved Americans (or, to be more fashionable and widely known, Yankees), perhaps a page of unusual historical facts that Yankee historians apprenticing now will write in the future. From a personal point of view, my skin is not white enough, and I am not qualified to be a wealthy American retiree. From a professional standpoint, I would rather have the lame Roosevelt elected than the copper-smelling puppet Landon take the stage. But this major event that could be a newspaper headline, newspaper material, has already passed. Four years ago, after the election results were revealed late at night, I wrote all night for the election of this lame president, but now I have no such interest or need. I am already satisfied after reading the newspaper headlines, and I am proud of this American playwright who won the Nobel Prize, because I have a certain fondness for his plays and at the same time only a smattering of knowledge about them. In this country, learned literary authorities may not have enough time, or perhaps because of what Lu Xun (may he rest in peace) said, they shy away from "work that requires a lot of effort but yields little profit." The power is then entrusted to us "small soldiers to wear the marshal's seal."</p>
<p>I am not a drama critic, not a playwright, not a director, not an actor, and certainly not an authority on O'Neill studies in China. I also have no experience in stagecraft, but I am just a professional writer with an empty stomach (because calling myself a "literary man" is a bit of an exaggeration). What can I say? What can I quote? What can I copy? It's truly like "lifting a stone to crush one's own foot"! But I can't control so much. Let's rack my brains.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in a so-called highest institution of learning infested with parasites who made a living by selling knowledge at heavily discounted prices, some young people gathered together and learned from a classmate who is now a famous playwright about O'Neill, an American playwright who had recently climbed to the highest honor, as told by a certain professor. At the same time, they learned that one of his plays was called "The Emperor Jones." Although I didn't study liberal arts, I was somewhat greedy for literature books. I stole time to read "The Emperor Jones," but unexpectedly, the American slang used by the black characters in it was beyond my ability to understand. Even if I did understand, it would take a lot of effort, so I gave up on this "royal book." Later, when I worked as a "jack-of-all-trades" helping with writing, I had a few American magazines to read and a few literary books to consult. American critics often talked about O'Neill, praised O'Neill, and were proud of O'Neill. I began to pay attention to this red-hot figure in the American literary world, who was imbued with the mysterious atmosphere of Ireland and wallowed in Freudian theory. From those comments that talked about him, praised him, and were proud of him, I learned that he had once been a sailor, and many of his plays had many scenes depicting the beauty of the sea. Some romantic ideals left to me by the petty bourgeoisie then turned into a dreamer of the sea, an admirer of sailors, a worshiper of pirates, and an enthusiastic lover of marine literature. I love Stevenson, I love Loti, I love certain works of Ibanez, I love all of Conrad's novels (although in "Typhoon," Chinese coolies were often treated like beasts, and I once got angry and threw the novel away). I also loved O'Neill. But although I was dreaming, dreaming of the sea, I couldn't be like "young Harry, the character in Conrad's short story 'Tomorrow'," and never "rot in one place," nor did I "take the world as my home." As a result, I finally became "Robert Mayo" in O'Neill's play "Beyond the Horizon," dreaming all day long, pointing to the beyond, summoned by the beauty, the distant and unknown beauty, yearning for the bewitching mystery, in order to let my unrestrained spirit roam in the vast space and wander freely, in pursuit of the joy of the secret hidden in that beyond. (The above quotations are based on Xu Youcheng's translation of "Beyond the Horizon"). But what was the result? He "married the soil" in order to win the love of the girl Ruth, working on that "stingy" soil, and shortened his life. This is the ruthless reality, and this is the unattainable and un-courageous fantasy of the Philistine. A young lad may have the courage of a Bohemian, a middle-aged person who is not too old and not too worldly may still have the fantasies of a Bohemian, but an old person, with rare exceptions, even this kind of fantasy has been completely worn away in the burdens of life. I used to be in the home of a professor whom I looked down upon, and he seemed to intentionally or unintentionally hint to me, "Little boy, are you restless? Do you have all sorts of ideals? I tell you, once you get married, once you get older, you will be as tame as a sheep. I think the best way to deal with those troublemaking young people is just to find them a partner." After listening to his words, I remember arguing with a red face, and the result was an unhappy breakup. A few years have passed, and I am not old yet. What does the reality tell us? I am savoring the professor's words and feeling a chill. This may be the reason why I was somewhat moved when I read O'Neill's play "Beyond the Horizon." Now, don't let that kind of Bohemian fantasy be lost again. When you have not experienced something, or eagerly hope for something, perhaps the color and flavor of that kind of emotion is different. We who have married the soil may envy the freedom of the sea, while "sailors who sail like horses" may yearn for the kind of stagnant, stinking family life on land that we have. "Old Harry" in "Tomorrow" became a sailor, but he was very disgusted with sailors. In Conrad's autobiographical novel "Youth," he also expressed his weariness with that sea life. Reading O'Neill's "Anna Christie," the father "Chris Christopherson" hated sea life. He hated the constant hard work at sea. He thought it was not good to seek a life at sea. His family members were all sailors. What was their life like? They only got rich wages in their pockets, got drunk, were robbed, and were penniless, and then went sailing again. They didn't go home. They didn't do anything a good person would do. "That old devil sea" would eventually swallow up his family members one day. So he hoped that his daughter Anna, according to his ideal, would one day "marry a good, stable land-dwelling fellow in the eastern United States, have her own home, have a few children, and he could be a grandfather, and he could go see them every time he came ashore." (See Anna Christie by Boni and Liverright, New York). This is the idea of an old sailor. Young sailors may not dream of settling down on land. In O'Neill's other play, "The Hairy Ape," the protagonist of the book, "Yank," who is called the hairy ape, hears the song of his companions:</p>
<p>"In far Canada,</p>
<p>Across the far sea,</p>
<p>There is a girl who is waiting passionately,</p>
<p>Organizing a family for me."</p>
<p>Then, this Mr. Hairy Ape Yank spoke with extreme contempt: "Stop farting, you lowly insects! Where did you get that phony family, family, hell! I'll organize a family for you! I'm going to beat you to death. Family! Tell family to go to hell! Where did you get that phony? This is home, understand? What do you want a home for? (Proudly) I ran away from my family when I was a child. Glad to be victorious, that's me. Family is a punishment for me, all in all. But you can't bet your shirts with me, none of you can do anything to me later. Want to try, any of you? Ha, I despise you. (In a more compromise but still contemptuous tone) (Girls waiting for you. Ha? Damn hell! That's all phony. They're not waiting for anyone. They're tricking you out of money. They're all whores, what words do you have to refute me? Treat them roughly, that's me. Tell them to go to hell! Whores, that's the whole thing, all of them." This sailor Yank looks down on women and looks down on family. What is it about the sea that attracts him? Perhaps as his companion Paddy said: When the ship opened "all the sails, countless days and nights," "the sky is burning like fire, the stars are twinkling eyes." On moonlit nights, you see the ship passing through the dim night, the sails of the ship are hoisted high, everything is covered with silvery white, and there is not a sound on the deck. Many of us dream, waiting all the time, until the ship you are on seems as if it is not a real ship at all, but a ghost ship like the Flying Dutchman. They say that ship will float on the sea forever without relying on the harbor." And in the daytime, "the warm sun shines on the clean deck. The sun warms your blood, and the sea breeze blowing in from the distant, dazzling, emerald-green ocean touches your lungs like strong wine." This kind of attraction of the sea is indeed enough to make us, who are rotting on land and at most creeping miserable creatures, dream of the ocean.</p>
<p>Yes, the ocean is worth lingering in, and the dream of the ocean will also attract people to do it. Once, I heard a friend of about the same age as me say that when he was a student, he wanted to escape from that uniquely Chinese dead family, put on a sailor's clothes, wore a sailor's white hat, and traveled back and forth on the deck, encountering a life with the sea as his home. My heart jumped. This remark seemed to come from the bottom of my heart. I think this kind of fantasy is probably common to all of us young boys and girls. I once read a story in the "North American Magazine" published in the United States about a British college student who became a pirate, and I was very fascinated. Destroying the Confucian robe and jumping out of this literary hell filled with the breath of death, what could be more romantic than this? But the dreams have long been blown away by the cold of the west wind. Now is not the time for us to dream. This kind of dream may be harmful to ourselves and our times. To borrow O'Neill's words: "Romantic fantasies, they have destroyed more lives than disease." (See his long play "Strange Interlude.") Our times do not allow us to dream anymore. We still have meaningful things waiting for us to do. Look: We have thousands of heavy stones on our heads; look, we are treading on an abyss-like pit; look, the waters of the Pacific are overflowing with bloodshed; look, the shameless are offering our鲜red blood with the most shameless means; look, the sick are drawing our path to death in the most sick posture; look, international hooligans are setting traps for us with the most sinister plans and the most solid chains, calling us to walk into their traps; look, there are no fences for iron hooves; look, there are no fences for spear points; look, there are no fences for the rampant airplanes; look, there are no fences for the intrusion of smuggled goods; look, there are no fences for the import of poisons; look, there are no fences for the internal crimes of the puppet army. Romantic fantasies, I want to borrow the title of a long novel by the British novelist Robert Graves to say for me: "Goodbye to All That."</p>
<h3 id="e183">Xi'an, the Historical City with Rusty Traces <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>Xi'an, this historical city with rusty traces, is truly soaked in ancient charm all over.</p>
<p>For example, as soon as you walk out of the street, what greets your eyes is the Bell Tower, which distinguishes the east, west, north, and south streets, standing like a giant in the center of the avenue, right? This majestic and huge building, accompanied by the Drum Tower, which is less than half a mile away to the north and has the same heroic appearance, stands facing each other there, and they have been boasting for several centuries.</p>
<p>So, if you like to commemorate the past, then there are enough places for you to ponder, and you have to linger everywhere. A barren open space is the ruins of some king or marquis, and a weathered stele is the handwriting of some talented scholar or celebrity. There is Du Fu Alley, and somewhere else is the Qin King's Mansion. Where is the Yin'an Hall, and where is the Imperial Garden? Everywhere, everything everywhere, is filled with ancient scenery, ancient relics, and sentiments, making you sigh, making you gasp, making you feel overwhelmed by the past and present. Those with deep ancient feelings will even shed tears!</p>
<p>So, you change your mind: from commemorating the past to viewing the existing. You go to the magnificent and solemn Confucian Temple in the south of the city. There, you can see the rare thousand-year-old pines and cypresses in the northwest, standing tall in the open space in front of the halls. There are also the towering, huge rectangular stone tablets, which are also precious rubbings of inscriptions from ancient times. After circling the halls, you climb the red steps and can see the majestic main hall, the magnificent glazed tiles, the huge pillars, the beautiful oil paintings, and the clean corridors. When you recite:</p>
<p>"The Place of the Great Accomplisher, Most Sage, First Teacher Confucius," even if you are the children of the Western God, after seeing that kind of solemn and pure artistic conception, you cannot but silently show respect.</p>
<p>Going to the Stele Forest next door is even more "an ancient forest indeed." It is said that it contains the essence of our nation's culture for thousands of years. No wonder the newspaper reported that the government recently decided to spend 50,000 yuan to renovate it.</p>
<p>There, there is no scenery of any kind. What there is is horizontal and vertical, a pile here and a pile there, lining up tens of thousands of stone tablets of all sizes. What Wei stele characters, written by Emperor Taizong of Tang, written by Kangxi and Qianlong, "imperial brushes" of emperors and cats and dogs of all dynasties, are all there. There are also many painting posts (of course, those of Wu Daozi are even more numerous). In short, it is worthy of being the source of Chinese rubbings. Outsiders (like the author) will naturally become dizzy and dazzled when they walk in to take a quick look. Even those who are in the know, when they get inside, will probably inevitably study and appreciate until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>You cannot but go to the History Museum (inside the current Provincial Library). Entering there, it is even more filled with strange things you have never seen or heard of on weekdays. A few broken stone slabs are put together, and it tells you that this is the Six Steeds of the Tang Dynasty (note). A dark, lacquer-black stove that villagers use to burn incense is a Zhou bronze tripod or Shang bronze ritual vessel from thousands of years ago. A stone bodhisattva with a muddy face, broken hands, and broken feet is a stone carving from the Jin and Wei dynasties. Small to the point of a broken bowl is cloisonné, and a tar-black copper piece is a Xin Mang currency. Gathered inside are bricks, tiles, Jesus, what the Weiyang Palace is, and the Afang Palace. In short, everything here is old and tells you about ancient years and ancient civilizations. As soon as you enter there, you will unconsciously come out with a body full of "ancient air."</p>
<p>After walking through these places, regardless of whether you will become a connoisseur or not, you have at least received the baptism of "ancient." So, when you walk into an antique shop, you will not be surprised by the fact that a newly unearthed broken tile and remnant brick is priced at forty or fifty yuan. When you walk into a restaurant and see ancient characters and books hanging on the wall, and ancient mirrors and bottles displayed on the table, you will feel that it is not appropriate and out of tune.</p>
<p>So, from ordinary people's homes, whether it is on a table or a pit, on a wall or a chair, you can always find one or two ancient utensils or ancient toys. Perhaps, from under a very dark opium lamp, you will discover an ancient Jiajing plate.</p>
<p>So, although airplanes are flying all over the sky and cars are running all over the streets, you may instead dream of the leisurely demeanor of the wooden oxen and flowing horses of ancient times. Your ears have also become "ancient." After listening to Western music, you will love Qin opera again. Your taste has also become "ancient." You will hate big dishes and seasonal dishes and love steamed buns and soup. As soon as the sky is light, you are already sitting at the restaurant that is said to have a pot head with a history of several hundred years.</p>
<p>So, in your own inn, although your furnishings have three-dimensional furniture, table golf, and a radio, you still need ancient Buddhas and ancient bottles. Those with more refined taste will also need Qin bricks, Han tiles, Wei steles, and Jin rubbings.</p>
<p>Slowly, the ancient charm of the city has been collected by you, so you can walk to the suburbs at will.</p>
<p>The suburbs are also full of ancient charm. East, south, west, and north, which place is not full of ancient charm and ancient sites?</p>
<p>Want to climb high? You can go to Mount Hua if it is far away, and you can climb Mount Zhongnan if it is near. It is a scenic spot for immortals, with pleasant scenery. Want to see the water? You can go to Guanzhong, observe the Yellow River, and watch the Xiaoshui River. It is also a famous ancient giant stream in the world. Want to pay homage to the great dead? There is the Yellow Emperor in中部, Emperor Taizong of Tang in Xianyang, and Emperor Qin in Lintong. Want to bathe and swear allegiance to your lover? You can take your Western-dressed Xi Shi or yellow-faced wife out of Lintong to the east. The Huaqing Pool is exactly the scenic spot and famous area where Li Sanlang and Ah Huan have been romantic for thousands of years. If you are still more affectionate, you might as well hold hands and go to Mawei Slope in Xingping to commemorate the burial place of this beautiful woman who has disappeared for thousands of years. Well, Ah... the heroic spirit underground will also be grateful if it knows.</p>
<p>In addition, such as the world-famous "Wang Baochuan", which has been studied in London and also performed, the ancient site is located in "Wujiapo," which is only ten miles away from Xi'an. There is also the Ba River, which now goes without saying that the riverbed is facing the sky, but it used to be the heartbreaking place for poets who bid farewell at the Ten Mile Pavilion. There are also the ruins of the ancient Wei'an city, the vast and majestic earth mounds, which will make people think of the atmosphere and greatness of the imperial capital in the past. There is also that... there is also that... In short, the famous scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an are inexhaustible to write about and inexhaustible to play with. The whole of Xi'an is shrouded in an atmosphere of "ancient." All the residents of Xi'an are completely enclosed in this atmosphere.</p>
<p>But what is a bit of a pity is that those who can breathe and appreciate this ancient charm are not the people of Xi'an who created the ancient sites in the past and are still creating them now, but rather some people who have nothing to do with it at all—so, no wonder the ancient Xi'an has recently become a bit dim. When Mr. Lu Yan wrote his impression of Xi'an last year, he only wrote about opium and crows and missed "ancient charm," or perhaps that is the reason.</p>
<p>(Note: The Six Steeds are said to be the stone carvings of the images of the six precious horses of Emperor Taizong of Tang who died for commemorating his risking arrows and stones and carrying heavy wounds.)</p>

<p>— Takeuchi Ketsuro</p>
<p>When I read about Lu Xun's death in the newspaper, I, like all revolutionary Japanese, felt great sorrow. Lu Xun's death is a great loss to the Chinese people, especially now, when the Chinese people desperately need their spokesperson. Lu Xun's death is also a great loss to the Japanese people, because through him we can hear the voices of the people in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Truly, he is the greatest writer in the East. Just like every great writer, he is also a great thinker. He dedicated all his talents and knowledge to the liberation of the Chinese people. Unfortunately, the Japanese people do not yet have such a great and influential writer as our spokesperson. Our Japanese revolutionary literature should learn more from Lu Xun's literary legacy.</p>
<p>After the death of Gorky, world literature lost another of its great representatives. I would like to express my deep condolences to the Chinese people through you. (Translated by Lai Shi)</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Latest Invention in the Treatment of Gonorrhea: The Supreme and Great Strategy Longed for by All Humanity <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Original text from Far Eastern Medical Journal No. 34, translated by Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>…An unheard-of method of treating gonorrhea with bile substances, achieving rapid and extraordinary results with extremely nimble procedures… Dr.'s thesis shocks the entire European medical community and proposes a simple external treatment for gonorrhea.</p>
<p>The biggest issue in venereology should be gonorrhea. In the past, there was no effective treatment for gonorrhea, a fact well-known by both the medical and non-medical communities. Precisely because there was no effective treatment, numerous remedies were constantly being introduced. However, these preparations mainly used yellow pigment as their primary component, and the quality of the yellow pigment was so poor that it often caused damage to the stomach and intestines and stimulated the kidneys. As for efficacy, yellow pigment only had diuretic and anti-inflammatory functions.</p>
<p>However, if yellow pigment is transformed into a derivative through special procedures, it can have no adverse side effects and can effectively treat the disease. This special procedure involves combining it with a reactive protein body; because if yellow pigment is not combined with a protein body, it cannot avoid being crude and causing side effects. The so-called mutual enhancement means precisely this. And the efficacy of the protein body? It is truly great, and the theory is profound, requiring a lengthy treatise to fully explain. Dr. Boeteur, a gonorrhea specialist, and Mr. Odietifen, a venereal disease expert, have long stated that protein bodies have the power to invigorate the whole body and blood cells to eradicate gonococci. If protein bodies are further combined with bile substances, the effect of treating gonorrhea is even stronger. The internationally popular 'Kelinong' gonorrhea medicine has as its ingredients protein bodies combined with yellow pigment, and also contains a large amount of Lipoid from bile substances. Not only does the special yellow pigment of the derivative eliminate gonorrheal urethritis, but also the protein bodies have a beneficial effect on revitalizing the body's cells, so 'Kelinong' will invariably be effective in treating gonorrhea and leukorrhea in both men and women, as well as uterine erosion and vaginal damp rot in women infected by their husbands with gonorrhea, achieving a permanent cure! With no risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Moreover, because 'Kelinong' contains bile substances, it can promote tissue regeneration, so the inflamed and eroded mucosa of the urethra can quickly recover and become healthy. If combined with external washing methods, the cure of gonorrhea will be even faster! Originally, besides using 'Cardiel Xuedi' vaginal suppositories externally for leukorrhea in women, male and female patients with gonorrhea should also use the German 'Anti-Gonorrhea Water' to wash the urethra or genitals, which has the effect of clearing local pus and turbidity, and avoids the pain of morning blockage and difficult urination!</p>
<p>Dr. Mollgaard, a gonorrhea specialist, recently presented a report on the efficacy of 'Kelinong', considering it an effective agent for gonorrheal testicular and prostate inflammation.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Alarming! The Deadly Wound in Male Development <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, graduate of the Medical Department of the Imperial University of Japan</p>
<p>…Masturbation during youth is a game of life… Weakness of the sexual nerves is the reward for bad habits.</p>
<p>The most alarming phenomenon among modern youth is their lack of vigor and sickly appearance. Whenever we encounter a young person who is developing—if we examine him closely—he has the bad habit of masturbation. Because they lack sex education, they do not know the dangers involved and simply treat life as a game. The result? Either their sexual organs are small, or they suffer from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, or incomplete erection. Why does self-indulgence have these adverse results? This is because the puberty glands are very fragile during development, like flower buds waiting to bloom. If they are destroyed by a storm, they will inevitably wither halfway. Masturbation hinders development and ages the sexual nerves precisely in this way. Once the puberty glands are injured, their endocrine function stops, so the various parts of the body do not receive nutrition, and many pathological conditions arise. The penis develops into a deformed state, such as being short, small, or curved. Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and inability to erect are caused by the sexual nerves being repeatedly stimulated by masturbation and not receiving nourishment from hormones. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to promote the vigor of endocrine function.</p>
<p>When I was studying at the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University, I was also very interested in researching youth diseases. At that time, I knew that the most appreciated treatment in medical journals of various countries was the use of Mellen's "Buti Kang" from Germany, which had the most effective results. Dr. Ypsilnti, the director of the Saalbeld Venereal Disease Hospital in Germany, used "Buti Kang" to cure 5,463 young people with incomplete development and sexual neurasthenia caused by masturbation. A total of 60,000 to 70,000 bottles of "Buti Kang" were used. After the doctor disclosed this achievement in the local newspapers, the German government and people were greatly amazed, and praised it as the lucky star of youth diseases. Soon it became popular all over the world. Since returning to China after graduation, I have also cured countless people with sexual neurasthenia with "Buti Kang". However, for those with nocturnal emission, combining it with "Nairesi Nocturnal Emission Pills" will yield faster results.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Most Valuable Contribution to the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Since Koch's Discovery of the Tuberculosis Bacillus <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>…Putting aside all perfunctory symptomatic treatments and fundamentally solving lung disease… Finding a ray of hope for TB patients who groan in pain all year round</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis has always been regarded as a most mysterious disease in various countries around the world, and scholars mostly focused on hereditary factors, at a loss as what to do. Since Koch's research in 1882, it was discovered that the pathogen of lung disease is the tuberculosis bacillus, which is a great invention in medicine and opens a definite foundation for the treatment of the world! Since then, all kinds of lung treatment methods have invariably targeted the tuberculosis bacillus!</p>
<p>In modern times, the more valuable lung treatment methods include the application of Tuberculin and the oral administration of calcium agents. However, in terms of actual effectiveness, even if Tuberculin is injected into the patient's body, it does not produce resistance in the blood to fight against tuberculosis bacilli. As for calcium therapy, it only has 'relative' efficacy and no 'absolute' efficacy. Although calcium agents can promote the formation of connective tissue barriers in lung lesions, it is actually difficult to reduce the vitality of tuberculosis bacilli.</p>
<p>These treatments have long been proven by scholars to be ineffective in definitively treating lung disease. Only after "collapse therapy" was publicly recognized by scholars, can lung disease patients, even in severe stages such as high fever and hemoptysis, be completely cured. Today, collapse therapy is also applied to oral preparations, plus the newly invented 'Bufei Naer', which has been repeatedly proven by lung experts to have the special effect of eliminating tuberculosis and nourishing the lungs. It can definitely reduce fever, relieve cough, eliminate phlegm, and stop bleeding after taking it, without any drawbacks. If there are also night sweats, insomnia, and nocturnal emission, it is advisable to take 'Buti Kang' together (for women, 'Bu Nu Rong'). I have cured many people since returning to China.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Youth is No Longer Hers <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>…The sorrow of faded beauty and delayed prosperity…The affliction of disease demons…</p>
<p>Female youth is inherently shorter than male youth. The first onset of menstruation marks the arrival of a girl's youth. Around the age of twenty-four or twenty-five, half of her youthful bloom has already faded, and this marks the arrival of a beauty's decline. However, if a woman's puberty glands are healthy and vigorous, she often maintains her youth beyond the age of thirty, and around the age of forty, she still has the graceful appearance of a young girl. However, most women, due to menstrual diseases and neurasthenia, often feel that youth no longer belongs to them around the age of twenty!</p>
<p>Originally, the flourishing or decline of female youth is entirely controlled by the ovaries. If the ovarian function is healthy, menstruation is smooth, the body and mind are happy, and the appearance is graceful and charming. If the ovaries malfunction, menstruation is difficult, and the metabolism stagnates, so blood flow is obstructed, resulting in anemia, and fat is reduced and muscles relax, becoming a terrible night fork. To restore youth, one must first adjust menstruation and invigorate the metabolism. Taking 'Bu Nu Rong' internally is most effective, because it can adjust ovarian function, strengthen the brain, and nourish the blood, so menstrual diseases can be cured, and neurasthenia such as headaches, insomnia, palpitations, and forgetfulness can also be cured. At the same time, the muscles are replenished, and the face becomes plump. Naturally, the bearing is elegant and youth is maintained. As for those suffering from leukorrhea, 'Cardier Xuedi Vaginal Suppositories' can be used externally to eliminate leukorrhea. This is what I have repeatedly verified since graduating from the Army Medical University.</p>

<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Mi Dashan. In the fifth week after suffering from gonorrhea, he mistakenly had sexual intercourse. The next morning, he packed his bags and went to Hankou. Due to sexual intercourse and the fatigue of travel, his symptoms suddenly changed. His perineum and anus ached dully, and urination was stinging. At the end of urination, there was often a mixture of white liquid and blood streaks. He developed a high fever and was extremely tired. Considering the inconvenience of medical treatment in Hankou, he returned to Shanghai by plane and immediately sought treatment at my clinic. Microscopic examination of his secretions revealed that gonococci were in droves in the prostatic fluid, in countless numbers. Most of the sperm were also dead, and pus and blood cells were also found (as in the first diagram). Further palpation revealed that the prostate was abnormally swollen, and it seemed to be about to suppurate. In addition to resting his body and using electrotherapy, he was also prescribed 'Kelinong' internally to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, prevent decay, and relieve pain. 'Kelin Water' was used externally for injection to directly kill bacteria in the urethra. Within three weeks, his gonorrhea was completely cured. Further microscopic examination revealed absolutely no trace of gonococci, only healthy sperm in the prostatic fluid (as in the second diagram). Therefore, Mr. Mi's gonorrhea was confirmed to be cured.</p>
<h3 id="e190">(First Diagram) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>This is the prostatic fluid of a prostatitis about to suppurate before taking "Kelinong". Gonococci are in droves inside.</p>
<h3 id="e191">(Second Diagram) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>After taking "Kelinong" and washing and injecting with "Anti-Gonorrhea Water", gonococci are eliminated in a short period. Only sperm are left in the prostatic fluid.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Conquering Leukorrhea <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is most prevalent among women, but also the most stubborn. Those who treat leukorrhea generally only use superficial astringent drugs to achieve temporary results. How could they know that this kind of treatment only increases leukorrhea as it is treated? The reason why leukorrhea is difficult to cure is because of its complex causes. Some are caused by physical weakness and irregular menstruation, some are caused by ovarian developmental disorders, and some are caused by infection with gonorrhea from their husbands. This kind of leukorrhea is extremely toxic, can kill sperm, and can cause blindness if it gets into the eyes. The local erosion is unbearable, and sexual intercourse and urination are unbearably painful. It is often the cause of irregular menstruation and infertility. Therefore, it is advisable to seek medical treatment early.</p>
<p>"Cardier Xuedi Vaginal Suppositories" is an extremely effective suppository for conquering leukorrhea. It has the functions of reducing inflammation, preventing decay, relieving pain, and killing bacteria. Regardless of whether the leukorrhea is old or new, it can be secretly treated at home. However, if you have irregular menstruation, are physically weak, or have incomplete development, you can also take "Bu Nu Rong". If you are infected with gonorrhea, you can also take "Kelinong". Taking care of both internal and external factors will yield faster results.</p>

<p>Stomach Illness and Poor Appetite</p>
<p>Ms. Lu Yushu from Changzhou wrote: Last winter, I attended a banquet and ate too much greasy food, which caused my appetite to stagnate. My husband treated me, but it turned into chronic stomach illness. My appetite decreased, my chest was stuffy and bloated, I had noisy hiccups, and vomited sour fluid. Moreover, my bowel movements were often dry and constipated, and I often passed cold farts. I was treated repeatedly without effect. Later, I was introduced by my friend Mr. Chen Liyan to take "Qiang Wei Jing" for about two boxes, and it worked well. After continuing to take it for about two boxes, my appetite increased greatly!</p>
<p>External Wash for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Baiqi from Xiahui Road in the French Concession asked: I have suffered from gonorrhea for a long time, and it stings when I urinate. In the morning, turbid pus blocks the urethral opening. May I ask if there is any good external medicine to wash away the turbid liquid from the urethra?</p>
<p>Answer: You can wash the urethra with the newly invented "Anti-Gonorrhea Water", which will yield good results. It has great efficacy and purity, and is not irritating. It is available at the Western Medicine Department of Yong'an Company and Taihe Pharmacy in Shanghai. Use it according to the instructions on the leaflet.</p>

<p>How to Deal with Gonorrhea Leading to Sterility</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is originally a symptom of the reproductive system, so it is most likely to destroy reproductive function. Epididymitis is especially prone to cause sterility. Once gonorrhea invades the vas deferens, the tube becomes inflamed and blocked, so it cannot fulfill its responsibility of transporting sperm, becoming the main cause of infertility. Fortunately, if it is not blocked, contact with the opposite sex will inject this semen and gonococci into the vagina during sexual intercourse, causing severe vaginitis or cervicitis. It can invade from the uterus to form salpingitis and oophoritis. Then, although the man will not become sterile, the woman is at risk of becoming sterile. Therefore, one must think deeply about this symptom so that it does not occur. If it does unfortunately occur, it should be properly treated to avoid the risk of sterility. The safest treatment is to take care of both internal and external factors, which is the most complete method. At the same time, the wife's gonorrhea must also be treated, to avoid repeated infections that negate previous efforts. The following is an example of someone who recovered his fertility after being cured.</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Gaowang, who lives on Avenue Road, suffered from gonorrhea for many days, and it turned into a complication of orchitis and epididymitis. He was treated in every possible way, but there was no hope of recovery. Moreover, he had transmitted the poison to his wife. Later, he purchased and read my "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from Datong and begged for treatment. After examination, it was found that there were thick tendons bulging between his penis and testicles, causing inflammation, swelling, and pain. Blood followed urination. I performed electrotherapy for him and instructed him to take German "Kelinong" internally. At the same time, I instructed him to purchase "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" from Taihe Pharmacy. After five weeks of continuous treatment, the inflammation completely subsided and the swelling was also eliminated. He was completely cured. This is because "Kelinong" has the effect of eating bacteria, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" has excellent antibacterial power in the urethra and other places. Therefore, it was able to achieve the above-mentioned efficacy. As for his wife's gonorrhea, it had turned into cervicitis, and a lot of yellowish-white dirt was secreted from her vagina. She was also given "Kelinong" as an internal medicine, and "Cardier Xuedi Vaginal Suppositories" as a suppository, and she was also washed with "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" from time to time. The disease was also cured in four weeks.</p>

<p>…The distinction between masturbation-induced nocturnal emission and non-masturbation-induced nocturnal emission… The principles and treatments for incomplete development and premature aging</p>
<p>If a man's ambition is not to abandon marriage and escape into the priesthood, like Catholics, then he will inevitably feel the need to marry and seek a companion. In fact, the two sexes are precisely the elements of this world.</p>
<p>However, marriage can create life or fall into a sea of suffering. Married men all feel that sexual life is the greatest key to maintaining love between the two sexes. A man with weak sexual performance, who does not have the ability to satisfy his wife's happiness, his inner shame and pain cannot be described in words. The wife's contempt and ridicule can make a tough man feel ashamed and unable to find a place to hide. As a result, he will feel extreme loneliness and boredom, and may become crazy and lose his ambition, eventually falling into the pessimistic and world-weary camp!</p>
<p>These poor men mostly suffer from impotence, or their erection power is not strong, and they ejaculate at the slightest touch. Some are simply not developed, like children; how can this capture the wife's heart? Many divorce tragedies are all played out like this.</p>
<p>The accompanying symptoms of impotence are nocturnal emission, poor memory, and other signs of premature aging, mostly caused by masturbation in youth, or by kidney failure and sperm slippage due to excessive sexual activity. Regarding the treatment of this symptom, according to the confirmation of Baynal M.D. of France and Dr. Bell of the United States, "Buti Kang", which invigorates hormones and puberty glands, has the most satisfactory effect on impotence, premature ejaculation, and incomplete development of sexual organs. If there is nocturnal emission, combining it with "Nairesi Nocturnal Emission Pills" will have even greater efficacy.</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Strategy for Resolving Bandit-Puppet Problems <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Regarding the recent Sino-Japanese negotiations, I have repeatedly stated that assuming that negotiations are conducted while constantly being invaded by bandits and puppets, such negotiations are not only ineffective but also fall into the trap of bandit-puppet schemes. It is better to stop the negotiations immediately. Regarding the bandit disaster in Suiyuan, I have also contributed some opinions, saying that in the bandit suppression plan, not only should our people provide a steady stream of supplies, but our authorities should also provide as much assistance as possible in terms of strength. This principle is obviously clear, and it does not require knowledgeable people to foresee it.</p>
<p>Now the Suiyuan incident has escalated to a serious level, and the war is in full swing. According to the Taiyuan telegram on the 17th, our frontline soldiers are fighting bravely in the icy and snowy weather, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's offensive. Our brave frontline soldiers are able to embrace this greatest determination, not hesitating to make any sacrifice to fight for the survival of the nation and protect the territory of the country. This spirit naturally deserves our admiration. As for the material supply in the rear, our people across the country are uniting to launch a Suiyuan support movement. Our military authorities must have already considered the assistance in terms of strength, so it is unnecessary for us to worry about it again.</p>
<p>What I want to say now is that more careful consideration should be given to the strategic direction of bandit suppression. According to our ancient military strategists, the momentum of offense and defense is different, and the emotions of labor and leisure are different. In war, it seems that it is easier to defend and more difficult to attack, and the attacker labors while the defender rests. This statement originally refers to situations where the strengths of both sides are equal. In the current era of scientific and mechanical warfare, it is not appropriate to adhere to this statement. Now the bandit army is attacking Suiyuan, using aircraft and artillery as cover. If we do not have these two, or if we have them but their strength is not equal, then no matter how much we defend, it will be difficult to sustain, and there will only be sacrifices, making it difficult to defeat the enemy. Sitting and defending a dangerous city will not help the facts. This is the first unacceptable thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the art of war says that whoever strikes first controls the enemy, and whoever strikes later is controlled by the enemy. Now the situation in Suiyuan is that we are controlled by others everywhere. Using the method of responding to attacks to defend is not a long-term solution, and the enemy concentrates its heavy troops in one place, so no matter how we resist, we will always expend more effort and achieve less success. We should change our strategy, send out a force like horns to divide their strength, and use the method of creating a diversion to confuse their vision, and then the great enemy can be eliminated. Moreover, the bandit-puppet army has occupied quite a bit of our land, and if we do not resolve this completely at this time, when will we wait? We can no longer stick to the saying that "if people do not offend me, I will not offend them," and sit and suffer the trampling of the bandit-puppets.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Now the bandit-puppet army's strategy is to concentrate its main force on Shangdu on one side and Guo Zhong on Bailing Temple on the other, advancing and attacking separately. They can attack and defend. We only have the means to protect ourselves and no strategy for offense. Nothing is worse than this loss of planning. Even if Suiyuan is fortunately preserved, it will not compensate for the broken territory outside the customs. If Suiyuan fails, the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu will be in danger of losing their lips and teeth. Therefore, in my opinion, the plan to defend only one corner is definitely not the best plan.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Gourd <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>In front of my residence, there is an old-fashioned house. In the spring, a vine climbed onto the roof tiles. In the summer, small white flowers bloomed, and in early autumn, fruits grew—two "gourds."</p>
<p>The "Gourd Flower Mirror" records: also known as bottle gourd, sown in the first or second month, it sprouts and climbs, its leaves resembling winter melon but slightly rounder, with soft hairs, white flowers bloom in May or June, the fruit is initially white, and turns yellow after frost. One type, round and large, is called "bao" [饱, full]. It is also named "hu" [孤, solitary], because it can hold water like a bubble. It can also be used as a container for storing wine. Another type, large at the bottom and small at the top, with a thin waist and a narrow mouth, is called "gourd." It can hold medicinal pills, large ones can be used as jar lids, small ones can be used as wine cups, children use them to float in water, and musicians use them to make sheng [笙, a reed pipe wind instrument].</p>
<p>In the countryside, there probably aren't many children who haven't played with gourds in their childhood. When I was young, I loved gourds very much. However, this was limited to the "large at the bottom and small at the top, with a thin waist and a narrow mouth" type. I used a red lacquered rope to hang it on my body. Later, after reading mythological books like "The Investiture of the Gods," I learned that immortals carried a gourd with them, and I loved it even more.</p>
<p>As for the "round and large" type, I have disliked it since I was little. My dislike for it is not because of the gourd itself, but because I dislike the shiny heads of monks. "Gourd, gourd head," I then associate and dislike this "round and large" type of bottle gourd.</p>
<p>Although I disliked it very much, my family still planted this "bottle gourd" every year. Between summer and autumn, small green bottle gourds grew on the vines. I secretly used a sharp nail to break them one by one. Only the ones that were too high to reach were allowed to grow.</p>
<p>In winter, the ladles in the rice jar and water jar were all unusable. My mother would tell people to pick the grown bottle gourds. They would be carefully split open, the seeds and pulp removed, to replace the broken ones. But at that time, I didn't dislike it any less because it was useful. Sometimes, behind my mother's back, I would put the bottle gourd from the rice jar and water jar on the ground and stomp on it forcefully.</p>
<p>I don't remember how old I was. My cousin came to my house to play. He brought a sheng [笙] made of "gourd," playing it with a "woo woo" sound. I was very happy to see it, but I didn't ask him for it, because I knew it would be useless even if I asked. Later that night, I deliberately stayed up very late, asking the servant to bring me my cousin's gourd sheng [笙] to play. I blew it for a long time, but it didn't make a sound. So I became very angry, feeling that this gourd was also deceiving me, and I stomped on it.</p>
<p>After stomping on it, I was very worried. I was afraid that my cousin would suddenly remember his gourd. But strangely, he never thought about it again, while I secretly hid all my own gourds, afraid that he would see them and be reminded of his own.</p>
<p>From then on, I no longer played with gourds.</p>
<p>When I was a little older, I regretted the story of destroying bottle gourds in my childhood. But it was too late.</p>
<p>In Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering," Huizi said to Zhuangzi: "The King of Wei gave me seeds of a large gourd, and I planted them and it yielded five bushels of water. If I filled it with water, it would be too heavy to lift. If I cut it in half to make a ladle, it would be so large that it wouldn't fit anywhere. It's not that it's not big, but I smashed it because it was useless." Zhuangzi said: "You are truly inept at using things... Now that you have a five-bushel gourd, why not consider using it as a large boat to float on the rivers and lakes? Worrying that it's too large and won't fit anywhere shows that you still have a closed mind!"</p>
<p>This is naturally a fable, but I truly felt for the first time the great usefulness of the bottle gourd. Whenever I had the opportunity to see a bottle gourd, I would always ponder for a long time.</p>
<p>Naturally, I still have a closed mind! Although I ponder because of the great usefulness of the bottle gourd, I still can't help but frown at the appearance of the bottle gourd.</p>
<p>The "Supplementary Records of Yijian" says, "Zhao Gongheng, a member of the imperial family, lived in Xiuzhou. He was easygoing and good at being considerate to others, but he was naturally humorous. Whenever he could crack a smile, he would blurt it out. Everyone who saw him respected and feared him. Because he had little hair, people commonly called him 'Zhao Gourd.'" Gong Jinglu wrote in "Reduced Character Magnolia," "Family is rarely amiss, raised a branch drawn in the same way; good for nothing, only to entangle the inverted vines by the fence, several times on the water, pressing and rubbing a hundred times is truly strong; nowhere to accommodate him, just let him bake in the hot sun into a dried knot." Then, I feel that the laughableness of the gourd head is definitely not limited to me alone. I am here just using it to make light of myself.</p>
<p>"If this child were fifteen years old, my whole life of hardship would be over!" thought the mother.</p>

<h3 id="e197">At the Character Analysis Stall <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>Sanzi took advantage of the boss's wife asking him to pick up the little boss from school and secretly slipped into the alley in front. He anxiously looked around before sitting down at the side of Sai Tieko's character analysis stall, carefully taking out three crumpled pieces of letter paper and an envelope from his inner pocket. —He had stolen these things from the store half a month ago and had been keeping them treasured ever since, but only today did he get the chance to let these papers see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Sai Tieko raised his reading glasses and sized up his customer before taking the letter paper and envelope from Sanzi, spreading them out and holding them down with an inkstone.</p>
<p>"Tell me! Who are you writing to? What are you writing?..." Sai Tieko folded the paper, ground the ink, and bit on the tip of his brush as he asked Sanzi.</p>
<p>"I'm writing to..." Sanzi said hesitantly, looking around. "I'm writing to my grandmother, sir! Please tell her that I'm in Shanghai, at Huang Jinlong's cigarette paper shop. I get up before dawn—really before dawn, even earlier than when Grandmother gets up in the countryside. Hongquan wakes me up. That shop assistant, Hongquan, is the shop assistant who started working at the store before me. Sir! Please tell her that I go to sleep very, very late, so I'm sleepy all day long..."</p>
<p>"Not getting enough sleep is the hardest, sir."</p>
<p>"It's been several days since the tenth lunar month," please tell her, sir. "I broke a wine bottle belonging to the boss's wife. It was a cheap bottle, like the soy sauce bottles that are placed in the corner of Chen Deye's kitchen. Because I got up too early in the morning, I accidentally broke it. The boss's wife wants me to pay for it, but I don't have any money to pay her. The two hundred cash that Grandmother gave me when I left home is all gone. So I received two hard slaps from the boss's wife..."</p>
<p>"I cried for a long time. I miss Grandmother."</p>
<p>"The two hundred cash that Grandmother gave me, I've spent it all. I didn't waste it, I really had no choice. Hongquan, that shop assistant, he knew I had two hundred cash, and he wanted me to treat him, otherwise, he wouldn't teach me how to do things. So I treated him to eight copper coins worth of peanuts. And once, the little boss wanted me to buy him candy, otherwise he would tell the boss's wife and I would get beaten. I have four copper coins left, and I bought an old rooster made of mud. It makes a sound when you blow it. I'm keeping it hidden, and I haven't broken it at all. I'll bring it back for my little brother when I go home."</p>
<p>"I... you... also got slapped twice by the boss's wife, and I hurt my head a little. It hurts a lot, it still hurts now. But it wasn't my fault, because the master told me to carry a package of toilet paper, and I didn't hear the boss's wife calling me from upstairs."</p>
<p>"Please tell my grandmother, sir! Please don't worry, if the boss's wife doesn't beat me, I'll be fine!"</p>
<p>"Please tell my grandmother, sir! I miss her very much. Because I miss her, I often cry. Please don't worry, Grandmother, I won't be naughty anymore. From now on, I'll listen to Grandmother in everything, and I won't upset her anymore!"</p>
<p>"It would be so good if I could go back to Grandmother's side! Sir, please tell her that I'm not naughty like I used to be at all! I miss Grandmother!"</p>
<p>"...Oh! And! Sir! There's also a spinning top, I left it in the wooden box under my bed when I left. Just give it to my little brother. I don't want it anymore."</p>
<p>Sai Tieko began to write on the letter paper, "To my dear Grandmother." Nine characters, with the brush held in his mouth, he stopped writing and kept looking at his customer.</p>
<p>"So, where is this letter going to be sent to?"</p>
<p>"Sent to the countryside. At Chen Street Town, West Market End, Chen Deye will pass it on to Grandmother."</p>
<p>"What countryside is that?"</p>
<p>"It's in the countryside. It's called Chen Family Town. Chen Deye is very famous. He lives on the east side of the Zhang Family Residence, that big house. Just give this letter to my grandmother, that Shi Grandmother who stokes the fire, or say Sanzi's grandmother, they won't make a mistake..."</p>
<p>"You can't write it like that on a letter!" Sai Tieko was embarrassed by him.</p>
<p>"Just write it like that, sir! They won't make a mistake. Sir, please tell my grandmother, sir, I miss her!"</p>
<h3 id="e198">Tragedy in the Dusk <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Pei</p>
<p>At dusk, I watched the sunset from the deck. Several seagulls following the ship soared around, their simple and sincere language adding infinite vitality to the picturesque and poetic twilight.</p>
<p>Only then did I realize the moving power of "beauty"—extending to all kinds of creatures. Who can say that the birds aren't in love with the dusk?</p>
<p>Look! On the golden and brilliant sea surface of the setting sun, in the beautiful twilight glow—in the poetic realm where the clear wind whispers from the seabed: more than a dozen passionate birds soar! Who can sing this poem?</p>
<p>One day—a tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the magnificent allure of the setting sun. Perhaps it was...—a bird flew far away from the flock towards the place where the sun was setting. Like an arrow, like a gust of wind, it flew so fast!</p>
<p>We all became worried, how would it come back?</p>
<p>However, it came back. Exhausted and frantically flapping its wings, it staggered back.</p>
<p>—It's back—</p>
<p>Amidst sympathetic cheers, but—it couldn't hold on in the end. It looked so weak, suddenly, it almost fell into the sea. It flew low over the sea, struggling desperately. The waves splashed, wetting its chest—abdomen. It struggled once, twice—rising up, finally: exhausted! Let a wave carry it into the deep seabed!</p>
<p>We silently stared at the sea for a moment. An indescribable feeling permeated our hearts.</p>
<p>Night clouds rose from the horizon.</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying "The Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>China and West (1040) Afternoon 1:00 to 1:45</p>
<p>Opening "Lin Chushi"</p>
<p>A corner of Lonely Mountain on the lake is green. Three hundred varieties of plum blossoms form a forest. What a, Lin Bu, whose heart is indifferent and far away. He is content with a bamboo thatched hut. He is not tainted by even a bit of dust. Not only does he love learning and never seek office. Moreover, for twenty years, his feet have not stepped into the city. Plum blossoms are his wife and his son is a crane. It can be seen that his unyielding heart and proud bones are innate. When the weather is cold, the crane guards the plum blossoms. It seems that Xuan Shi is carrying on the filial love and there are still a thousand affections. The plum is like a beautiful cheek. The crane cries in the shade. One is, a fairy from Guye Mountain smiling prettily. One is, the clear and light chick phoenix reading aloud. Occasionally, a distinguished guest visits the mountain temple. His servant lets the phoenix fly into the blue clouds. Only see them dancing gracefully to welcome the head of the family. The gentleman is, on a small boat with a melon rind returning home from afar. Better than the innocent children of the Tao family waiting at the brushwood gate. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting. Loves to sing and write poetry. Saying that I don't need fame in the world, so stop saving the drafts. However, sparse shadows slant across the clear and shallow water. Faint fragrance floats in the yellow dusk moon. It has already been a beautiful sentence passed down to this day. Afterwards, the king awarded grain and silk. He also changed his name to He Qinghao, Mr. Gaojie, leaving a unique name behind him. It is said that Maoling will one day seek the lost drafts. Fortunately, there were no Fengshan articles. It can be seen even more that Feng Liu is dissolute and has long neglected Zhang Qing.</p>
<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang "Double Pearl Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) Afternoon 3:30 to 4:15</p>
<p>Opening "New Book Title"</p>
<p>Hot blood blooms everywhere into flowers of freedom. Sunset glows and lonely wild ducks sing peace to the sands. The red glow of the full river shoots into the red sky. The war zone warblers and flowers record brave words. Good young men lie drunk in the sandy battlefield. The records of horse trading evokes past differences. Thinking back to the beginning, love arose from the comedy of marriage. A bead was made into a pledge. Spend the honeymoon in the Palace of Eternal Life. The hairpin Phoenix Phoenix rises, a disaster of flowers.

<p>Opening "Yingying's Heart of Qin"</p>
<p>The fragrance of lotus and the clear water move in the cool breeze. The water moves, the cool breeze extends the summer day. Long days of summer. The fragrance of green lotus. Miss Yingying calls Hongniang. With you in the fragrant boudoir, there is nothing to do. Go to the back garden to relieve boredom and dispel your worries. Hongniang listens. Joyously. Following the young lady, she moves her steps downstairs. Turning and winding, she faces inward. She passes through the wooden fragrant shed behind the bamboo screen. She walks to the White Plum Pavilion and stands. There, she sees that it is densely shaded from the sun. What a clever little Hongniang. She hurriedly pushes open the windows on all four sides. The table is placed in the center. The Yaoqin [a stringed instrument] is taken out of its bag. Incense is burned in the precious tripod furnace. The young lady sits down and starts playing. First, she plays "The Lament of Xiangfei." Then she plays "The Phoenix Seeks the Male." When several Yaoqin songs are finished, she sees that the golden crow is gradually setting in the west. Hongniang is busy and flustered. She closes the windows on all four sides. The Yaoqin is hung on the wall. The smoke and fragrance are extinguished in the precious tripod furnace. The mistress and maid return to the boudoir together. Going forward along the original road. The small bridge winds and reflects in the pond. She sees two mandarin ducks resting and playing in the pond. The servant girl is frightened. The cool breeze of early summer moves the water. The water moves, and the cool breeze extends the summer. Although the beautiful scenery is unusual.</p>

<p>The tragic life of Sai Jinhua is now being brought to the stage, which is truly an unprecedented treat for the eyes of those who love theater. The performers are the 40's Society, based on Xia Yan's original work. The content is grand and moving. There are grand scenes such as Sai Jinhua persuading Waldersee and others when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing 37 years ago, which are worthy of singing and weeping about. The stage and screen actress Wang Ying plays Sai Jinhua, performing vividly and colorfully. The section where Sai Jinhua is old and faded, with a tragic ending, is guaranteed to bring tears to people's eyes. There are more than 60 performers, all well-known figures on the stage and silver screen. The directors are Hong Shen, Shi Dongshan, Ying Yunwei, Ouyang Yuqian and others. Such a large gathering of talent is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Public performance at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting today.</p>

<h3 id="e204">The Glory of Domestic Films - "Shanghai" to Show "Night of Revelry" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>A Valuable Piece of News:</p>
<p>The humorous comedy "Night of Revelry" directed by Shi Dongshan of Xinhua Company has been scheduled to be shown at the Shanghai Grand Theater, which has never shown Chinese films before, starting on the 21st of this month (Saturday).</p>
<p>The script for "Night of Revelry" is adapted from the famous stage work "The Inspector General" by the great Russian writer Gogol. After watching this film, the Soviet ambassador praised the film's achievements and requested that the company allow the film to be shown in the Soviet Union, and the owner of the Shanghai Grand Theater took this opportunity and asked someone to entrust the film to Xinhua so that the film could be shown in the theater first, and he also found a way to explain it to the side.</p>
<p>The fact that "Night of Revelry" can be shown at the Shanghai Grand Theater, and even exported to the Soviet Union, allows us to imagine the value of this film. At the same time, we are very pleased that domestic films can have the opportunity to be introduced to domestic audiences, and cause them to pay attention to Chinese films.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Grand Light Shows "Riding the Dragon and Praising the Phoenix" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Starring Clark Gable and Myrna Loy</p>
<p>Clark Gable is the number one celebrity in Hollywood. Myrna Loy is a famous star who has been famous for a long time. Their collaboration, "Cain and Mabel," will be shown at the Grand Light today. The story tells of a pair of sworn enemies who, because of the theater publicist's publicity trick, unintentionally turn from enemies into relatives. "Hating them to the point of grinding your teeth, and loving them to the point of treasuring your heart," these two sentences are no different from a portrayal of the characters in the play. Not only is the plot and performance of this film hot and extreme, but the grandeur of the song and dance scenes is unprecedented. The mountains are high and reach into the clouds, the pearl light is brilliant, the flesh screen stands tall, and the spring colors are endless. I am afraid that only Warner Bros. has such courage and is willing to make such sacrifices.</p>
