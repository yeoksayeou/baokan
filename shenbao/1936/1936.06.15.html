<p>十七由穀城至襄陽</p>
<p>由石花街返穀城、候車回河口轉襄陽、時值第四十軍調防過此、武裝同志、絡繹不絕於途、陡步長征、勤勞可念、久候車至、滿載該軍病兵、予幸擠上、終被擠下、一上一下之間、又有一無蓬車至、乃得攀登行行重行行、目的地之老河口、又已在望、停車涉襄河、四十軍部隊、正結集河灘、軍容甚整、進城受嚴密盤查、與日前過此情形、截然有異、方解裝逆旅、而該軍大至、分駐各房、旅長亦駐節於此、予呼待役備食、衛兵以官長正開會議、禁上發聲、下樓亦不允許、因之飲食及大小便之自由、皆被剝奪、困處重圍、久無援救、經賈勇出刺謁其旅長、雖未得見、幸准下樓、卒又被格不得上、目送地方官紳、往來蹀　、至晚十二時、始由侍役報名而進、此一日中、半度牢獄生活半度放逐生活、皆該軍調防所賜、念及四團劍戟如林、竟夕不能成寐、</p>

<p>名勝有隆中·岘首習家池·鹿門寺·米公祠·王粲樓·昭明樓·張柬之祠·杜工部墓·王叔和墓等、王樓僅存片石、杜墓莫辦真贗、米祠碑刻甚多、其商孫窮而嗜煙、售碑帖為活、隆中在城西三十裏、大山環抱、林木幽深、有三顧堂、淡泊亭·草盧亭·梁父岩·野雲菴·半月溪·小虹橋·躬耕田·荷花池·老龍洞·龍臥處·八角井·銅鼓亭諸勝·岘首為岘山之首、在城南四五裏、上建有亭、山麓有羊杜祠、墮淚碑卽在祠內、習家池係晉習　所居、擅亭臺花木之勝、山簡鎮襄陽、輒沈醉於此、地有泉水、極為清冽、且可灌田、因習　齒而名益彰、鹿門寺在樊城、為浩然故裏、皆遊屐所必至、諸葛公之羽扇綸巾、羊太傳之輕裘緩帶、彥威史筆、孟浩詩才、流風余韻、蔚然被於江漢之間、及今訪其遺跡、亦足發探古之幽情、惟各地皆有道人住持、以彼俗傖、主此勝地、未免稍殺風景耳、（五月二十日發於襄陽）</p>

<p>建築及其設備</p>
<p>從元朝初年起、直到民國十六年、北平一向是我國國都所在的地方、這其間萃全國的財政力量、在此地經之營之者、達六七百年之久、今日之宏大規模、亦吾先民長期努力經營之結果、自非易事、此地建築、趨向平房、樓房舊式者不多見、西式者亦大率祇有兩三層、達四層以上的、祇有北京飯店等旅館式建築、以及北京大學紅樓等學校式建築、唯其均係平房、故佔地亦多、現在北平全市、　地甚少、但見鱗次櫛比、　角相接、皆房屋也、此種稠密情狀、與南京之城市山林、廣地比比皆是之情狀、正屬相反、故南京人口剛近百萬、已嫌擁擠、而此地居住一百五十多萬人口、尚覺寬綽有余、此地建築、宮殿式之紅牆黃瓦、翹角飛簷、久已馳名世界、為東方建築藝術之代表、卽普通建築、亦大率灰瓦青磚、房屋均作規則之四方形、又大方又整齊、兩扇大門大率　以紅漆、用綠漆黑漆者、亦間有之、門上設銅環或鐵環、以備敲門者叩擊、普通又在門橫上按置電鈴、新舊並列、牆上厚、均在一尺四五以上、屋頂亦厚達三四尺以上、故能擋風蔽日、冬暖而夏涼無論大家小戶、皆有空廓之院落、廂房與正房不相接、廁所廚房、亦均與正屋隔離、院落裏、因雨量稀少、故青草不生、但花木藤蘿之屬、悉皆種植數棵、以資點綴、稍闊的、又有花園、其中參天大樹、搖　生風、</p>
<p>窗上、大率糊以紗布及白紙兩層、惟此層白紙、可以上下舒擲、無風卷起有風則放下、在夏天、凡向東西者、更於此外加竹簾一層、宅內門扇方面、大悉為單扇、且多半向外開、由屋內出外者推門、由屋外進內者反為拉門、門上、稍考究者、亦於冬夏二季掛簾、盡此地多風沙、不得不如此也、又因氣候關系、故無論貧富、冬季室內均須生火爐、不過富者為高大之洋鐵爐、而貧者則為矮小之鐵爐、至於暖氣管之設備、除學校旅館及各公共機關而外、私人住宅中不多見、此則一由於經濟原因、一則由於建築結構、</p>
<p>住的等級</p>
<p>學校及公共機關、一般情形均好、此不能作為通常住宅、私人住宅、粗粗分之、可分成上中下三等、上等住宅、大率紅漆大門、電燈、電鈴、電話、自來水、無不具備、一進大門、有號房或傳達室、在大門旁、並附有車房一間、以備自備汽車或東洋車停歇、此中房屋、以三進為普通、最多亦有達十余進者、上房下房、廂房書房、廁所廚房、以及飯廳公客廳之類、均應有盡有、附有花園的、自屬花草樹石、無不具備、卽未附花園者、其庭院中、亦都花草成畦、樹木蔭翳、此類住宅，每所價值、最少須在萬元以上、住著這樣房子的人家、至少須　號房一人、車夫一人、且用電用水、以及戶捐等開銷、每月非百元以上是不行的、中等住宅、外觀上亦頗堂皇、惟其結構、較上等者略簡、比如普通一進大門、大率並無號房、祇迎門豎一屏風、以作內宅一切之屏蔽、其實轉過屏風、亦不過只有一進或二進之房屋而已、院落大率不很大、其中亦間或雜植花草、或略置夾竹桃等類之盆景房屋總大十間到二十間左右、電燈自屬每戶皆備、電話獨備者頗不多見、普通情形、是幾家合按一具、或由隣居（此地名曰「街坊」）按有電話者轉呌、每月貼電費一二元、自來水通常均備、如備有自用洋車者、其車祇好停在一進大門之門樓裏、或寬深之走廊下、廚房大率祇有一間半披、此種半披、僅有一面屋頂、而無所謂屋脊、廁所並無獨立一間、祇附在屋廟牆上、頂用折鐵一蓋、下挖深坑一二卽是、會客廳與書房、往往在一處、此類住宅、結構雖小、但單門獨戶、亦頗緊慎而恬定也、夫婦二人之小家庭、住此類房屋最宜、每所價值、約在千元以上萬元以下、如屬租賃、每月僅房租一二十元左右而已、</p>
<p>下等住宅之最大特色、在於其集合而居、單門獨戶者頗少、而此類住宅之最典型的代表厥為「大雜院」所謂大雜院者、卽在一大院落之週圍、聚立數十間乃至百余間之矮屋、每戶住矮屋一間或數間、但超過五間的、卻不常有、院落中無花無草、僅為一遍積滿灰土碎磚、高低不平之泥地而已、牆陰屋角、拋滿爛菜破布、煤渣積土、人一走過、蒼蠅乃嗡然而飛、烈日薰曬時、臭惡味令人欲吐、窗洞甚小、光線不足、全家數口、往往　在一張炕上、此種炕面積甚大、兩頭抵牆、其闊亦佔全屋之半、普通燒飯、煤爐均置在門外、一遇天雨、則將爐搬到屋內、此時雖廠門透風、亦灼熱不可耐、天熱時、則院中放滿矮桌短凳及破蓆之屬、袒胸露臂、男女老少、赤膊坐臥其中者、比比皆是、汗氣彌漫、如嗅餿粥、此類大雜院中、住的人大率以洋車夫家庭為最多、此地洋車夫、共有八萬人、是以大雜院亦所在皆是、每戶每月租金、祇幾角或一二元、</p>
<p>臨時公共住所</p>
<p>北平公共的臨時住所、大概可分五種、　飯店、　旅館、　客棧、　公寓、　雞毛店</p>
<p>飯店之類、大率為洋式、其中一切設備、均為新式、有西餐可吃、有音樂可聽、且其中如北京飯店、並設有跳舞廳、此類飯店、下榻者大悉為經濟優裕之達官貴人、或富商大賈、每日房屋、至少須在二元以上、一共約八九家、比較高貴華麗的、為北亦飯店及六國飯店二家、經濟一點的、象北辰宮飯店其房金每日一元也就夠了、</p>
<p>旅館與客棧二者、在此地略有不同、前者係民國肇元後始告與盛、後者則大率有數十年歷史的、旅館之建築設備、較客棧為新式、比如訂榻、前者為銅床、而後者則木架　繃床居多、且旅館多為樓房、客棧則平房居多、管理招待、旅館亦較客棧進步、顧客方面、旅館以學商二界為多、客棧中除小商人外、時有來自鄉間之　客、旅館集中地域、為西河沿一帶、如交通旅館·正陽旅館·等皆是、客棧集中地域、為打磨廠·騾馬市·一帶、如天達店·長發棧·等皆是、房金方面、旅館比客棧較貴、前者自數角至數元、後者最多一元多、</p>
<p>北平公寓之多、亦可與飯店相埒、當得上「林立」二字、蓋此地一面學校多、而有寄宿舍者不多、另一面全閒之民房、卻比比皆是、北平人靠市戶吃飯之風尚、由來已久、至此、應社會需要、租其房組人相率而起矣、公寓房屋及一切設備、相當於中等住宅、住客以學生為多、每月房金、一間約由三玩至五元不等、如代包夥食、則約需十二元至十五元、</p>
<p>雞毛店者、乞丐·流浪漢·江湖買藝者·及小偷等之臨時寄宿處、每人一晚祇須五六枚、（卽大銅板三枚左右）比等雞毛店、以天橋一帶為多、店中鋪陳雞毛成堆、寄宿者可隨便睡臥其上、此中　　困苦之狀、與身住洋樓　鋼絲床絲棉被者一比、實不啻一在天上、一在地獄矣、</p>

<p>六公司决議减班停輪</p>
<p>中外航商、視長江航路爲營業之生命錢、自去年六公司同盟公攤以來、水脚提高、回扣减低、尺碼重量、均取消寬放、並委平準洋行代辦量尺過鎊等事、由是客家裝箱貨、紛改民船·火車·及郵包裝運、故六公司在營業上、卽受重大打擊、最近、因種種環境關係、長江貨運量上、形成數十年來罕有之銳落、今已成噸位過剩、同蒙虧蝕之現象、六公司爲此、已迭開全體會議、討論補救方策公議結果、除减班停船、及調査實際狀况、再定根本之策、探誌詳情如後、</p>
<p>營業虧損</p>
<p>自上海至漢口一段、曰長江錢、自漢口至宜昌一段、曰中長江錢、六公司航行此兩路之船、往來貨運儎脚、均照公攤制計算去歲下半年成續尙佳、今年自一月至今、半年來、無論來去、均逐月减退、迨量尺實施、更一落千丈、四月分起、上海本街貨之運赴長江者、更寥寨無幾、今歲比較上年同時運貨量、有十與六之比者、有祗及二分之一者、原因雖不止一端、而各公司之水脚收入上、則虧蝕過巨矣、</p>
<p>維持公攤</p>
<p>交通部代部長俞飛鵬、曾爲此事來滬、召集招商·三北·寗紹·等各輪公司負責代表、討論救濟辦法、當時主張將公攤制度中辦法改善、但磋商之下、認爲如果廢止同盟公約、勢必釀成競爭貶價之濫放水脚、會商結果、仍舊維持公攤原制、惟將量尺貨之寬放問題、則議商一折衷辦法、以和緩客家、同時更與太古怡和日淸等說明此意、因之公攤約、仍照常維持、</p>
<p>减班停輪</p>
<p>六公司長江班輪、太古十三船、怡和十船、招商及三北各七船、日淸七輪、寗紹兩輪、（連同中長江船、六公司入公攤約者合六十八船、）近來各公司上下水江輪、每每祗及三四成儎脚、所得運費不够燒媒、故於上星期三、由六公司開議討論、照此營業、難以維持、非六公司全體减班停輪、無以挽救、當塲一致議决、太古·怡和·招商·三北·及日淸·等五家、每星期長江班（連上海直放宜昌船與直放湘潭船在內）每一公司、一星期中、不超過四班、照現在行駛船舶班次計之、每週至少减去六班、一個月須减少二十四船云、</p>
<p>尙未一致</p>
<p>英商太古公司、且已首先將長江輪减少、該公司向有上海至宜昌直放班輪、每週必開一船、茲已開始停航、而將長江船內長沙輪、改派爲漢口宜昌班、不再來滬、上項减班停輪之議案、當由六公司代表聲明、凡各公司停班休航之船、其損失仍由公攤項下酌提補償、以示大公、惟日淸公司反對之、其理由爲該公司之長江船、每開一次、由政府貼費、滬上公司、無减班之權、故於日淸問題、六公司尙須再議、</p>
<p>派員調查</p>
<p>六公司以今年近兩月中、長江營業銳落、究竟其眞因何在、非親赴長江、爲整個的考察調査、難以明瞭、並爲便利隨時商議補救起見、已經公同討論結果、决組織六公司集團長江調査委員會、已推定太古大班·怡和大班·招商局業務課長曾廣頃·三北副經理伍德隣·寗紹主任盧于暘、准本月底、由滬出發、沿長江各埠、均須爲詳晰之考査、以爲補救之根據也、</p>

<p>碼頭交通建築工竣</p>
<p>虬江碼頭進出唯一之交通要道、爲五權路、該段路錢、自碼頭起接至軍工路止、早經市府規定、惟市府經費支絀、迄未興築、虬江碼頭完成在卽、若該段路錢不築、則碼頭交通不便、因此中央銀行與市府合作、築路經費十五萬元、由中央銀行一次撥足、半數作爲市府借欵、半數作爲中央銀行擔負、該路工程、由市工務局招標興築、動工業已數月、正在趕築、不久可以築竣、該路築竣後、前往碼頭者、不必再由定海島擺波、可自楊樹浦達軍工路、折入五權路、直抵碼頭、</p>
<p>設鐵道接通淞滬綫</p>
<p>虬江碼頭、爲求水陸聯運之便利起見、擬於碼頭前後、敷設鐵道數條、至五權路合併爲一、沿市中心區北部、接至淞滬綫、長約九公里、是項鐵路、已由兩路管理局計劃、需費七十餘萬元、此項費用、應如何籌集、現正由中央信託局與兩路管理局商酌辦理中、日後該路綫築成、對於旅客貨物等之運載、便利萬分、是誠虬江碼頭之特點、</p>
<p>木椿遲到影響工程</p>
<p>我國巨大建築、需用椿木、均來自外洋、虬江碼頭工程浩大、自亦不能例外、所用椿木、約需數千根、且均爲百尺或百廿尺長者、由承建廠商創新營造廠、向美國訂購、陸續運滬、原定於本年三月到齊、最近美國木樁公司發生罷工風潮、致尙有樁木數百根、未能運到、碼頭倉庫工程、原本於九十丹間、可以吿竣、因此不無稍受影響、完成日期、或將稍遲、虬江碼頭、爲我國唯一之犬碼頭、對於設備方面、務求完善、現正向各外商選購各種機器、如起重機·運貨滑車等、以便裝設碼頭應用、</p>
<p>籌備舉行奠基典禮</p>
<p>虬江碼頭興建以來、於茲一載、各項工程、已具相當規模、現該行定於本月二十日下午三時、安置基石、舉行盛大奠基典禮、柬邀各界參加、發出請柬數百份、該行孔總裁庸之、及虬江碼頭建設委員會宋主席子良·暨各委員等、屆時均前往致詞、此奠基禮在一月前卽由該行虬江碼頭事務處着手籌備、關於禮塲之佈置、及接送來賓之船隻等、均由庶務科準備齊妥、招待方面、則由信託局全體高級職員擔任、宣傳方面、則由信託局祝副經理世康·及徐秘書履盛負責、</p>
<p>中央銀行刋念册</p>
<p>中央銀行並刋發紀念册、分送各來賓、以資紀念、而事宣傳、紀念冊上各大外商輪船公司經理之評語甚多、並有孔部長導言、虬江碼頭建設委員會主席宋子良建築虬江碼頭之計劃、以及吳市長·國際貿易局郭局長·之論文多篇、足見虬江碼頭此次之奠基禮意義甚大、茲覓得該奠基典禮程序單一紙如下、　虬江碼頭建設委員會主席宋子良致開會詞、　孔部長訓詞、　吳市長訓詞、　公安局奏樂、　孔部長行奠基禮、　攝影、　茶叙、</p>

<p>歡迎秩序　該公司預定之歡迎來賓股東秩序如下、　來賓股東齊集花園、　升國廠旗鳴砲致敬、　小學生唱歡迎歌、　攝音、　開歡迎會、　參觀、　來賓遊覽南湖、　股東會、</p>
<p>致歡迎詞　董事長徐桴致歡迎來賓詞、略云、今日係民豐造紙廠六屆股東會之日、辱承各界踴躍光臨、不勝樂幸、本人年來因政務纏身、對於廠務、多由總經理竺梅先先生負責、自覺甚愧、本廠開設迄今、已有七年、管理經營、均可言甚佳、在此七年中、整個社會陷入不景氣狀態下、各工廠或實業機關、紛紛倒閉失敗、惟本廠能照常繼續前進、此實為經協理努力之功、猶憶蔣院長於本年元旦播音演講稱、生產建設實為救國之要圖、吾人能藉創立工廠而增加生產、解決許多人之生活、杜塞漏巵、增加稅收、其對於國家社會之利益、實非淺鮮、設國內各工廠、均如本廠之發展、則必能強盛、今日蒞臨者、均為實業工商輿論各界知名之士、尚希望輿論界之提倡指導、金融工商界之提攜與幫助、使本廠能每日進步云云、</p>
<p>創立經過　徐氏致詞畢、總經理竺梅先、繼起報告該廠成立經過、略謂、本廠於民國十九年創立、在民十九年間、國內之造紙廠計有六家、有一家名曰和豐、此六廠、至今均失敗、其原因不能與某國有組織之廠相爭、每廠年有三千餘噸之產量、而中國需要僅二千噸、不得不跌價互爭、即以馬糞紙而論、原售價每噸須銀八十兩、竟跌至二十兩、本廠即向和豐廠購下、當時感到甚大之痛苦、於是設法改進並聯合其他同業各廠、辦理聯合營業所、減少無謂競爭、但尚有一家紙廠、至今未加入、此則仍為缺點、如是之後、價格雖漸恢復、而產量依舊甚多、且過剩者均為馬糞紙、而其他需要之紙、則仍無生產、盡為舶來品、如香烟筒內之硬皮紙、年銷一二萬噸、織綢廠印花所用之提花紙板及其他紙張、均為外貨、因之本廠不願與各同業共同造馬糞紙、且為姊妹廠杭州華豐廠同時停造、如是僅有四廠造馬糞紙、供求將可相等、本廠方面、則專製提花紙、及香烟所用之紙、尤以國產之南洋烟廠購用極多、去年本廠、復撥資本七十五萬、則製捲烟紙、（即捲烟外之用紙）至今雖未臻完全成功之境、而已可適用、現在南洋及四五家華商烟廠、已經定購、此後尚望各方指助云云、</p>
<p>代表致詞　嗣由股東代表褚慧僧致詞云、兄弟代表、現在之民豐及以前之和豐廠股東致詞、當民十四和豐創設時、是時因國內造紙廠僅有一家、因之供求相應、而可盈利、後繼起者頗多、更以日貨傾銷、又逢齊盧戰爭、和豐遂完全失敗、而致破產、在此時中、幸而得有梅先生和其他新股東繼續經營、今和豐雖已成過去、而廠基則依舊存在、一種事業之能發達、雖為自己之努力、亦須賴各界之擁護援助、但國貨之能發達、尚須賴關稅為保障、故外貨馬糞紙、亦能絕迹、現在因走私之關係、私貨紙張、可無稅入口、此實為本廠及同業各廠之危機、望各位來賓、與本廠盡力抵制私貨、不特本廠之幸、亦為整個國貨工廠之幸、褚詞畢、即由來賓新聞報記者嚴獨鶴氏演說、略謂過去國貨失敗、有二原因、　虧蝕後無繼起者之繼續奮鬥、國貨廠商彼此互相傾軋嫉妬、而民豐廠則能於繼失敗者之後、而積極經營、且創議與各廠合組聯營、是其能鞏固商戰陣綫成功之來、當非倖致、今者復發明國貨捲烟紙、使吾人能吸到純粹國貨之香烟、其精神實堪欽佩云云、嗣又由社會局科長吳桓如、浙江建設廳長代表凌瑞拱二氏、相繼致祝望之詞（詞長從略）畢後、即在大廳舉行午餐、食畢、各來賓由該廠職員陪往參觀、全場工程、並至南湖遊覽、股東會則於晚間開始舉行云、</p>
<p>工程概述　民豐造紙廠、在嘉興東車站附近、前和豐紙廠故址、至民十九創立、資本計一百二十五萬、董事長徐桴、總理竺梅先協理金潤庠、該廠估地共約百餘畝、為國內大規模之造紙廠、其重要工程、計如下列所述、　軋鋼工場、該廠所製捲烟紙之原料、係廢麻破漁網等、故設有軋鋼工場、即將漁網軋成細小、然後可以提取纖維質、　去灰工場、將麻布等之原料、及去灰土、俾使清潔、　選料工場、將原料選出切小、預備製漿、在該場服務之女工、均戴防毒口罩、恐有污穢入口、記者等往參觀時、見各女工頗似在實行軍事練習、　打漿場、將原料整理畢後、送至漿場、該場設有各種打漿機、納入機中、輾成液體之漿、初成之漿、並不清潔、經數輛機器之提煉、遂成潔白之漿末矣、　製紙間、將潔淨之漿末、加入機中、加以輾製、未幾即造成潔白之紙張、白機輪中滾出、至此造紙工作、完全成功、只須用機測騐其拉力若干、即可知紙張之質料、該廠除工程外、尚有工人子弟學校、（即民豐小學）工餘補習學校等、堪稱吾國模範工廠之雛型也、</p>

<p>今年是兒童年，希望大家特別注意兒童衛生！講到兒童衛生我們不妨先提出下面幾個數目：</p>
<p>（1）中國人口四萬萬，每年要死亡一千二百萬人（估人口總數千分之三十），其中至少有四百八十萬人（佔死亡數百分之四十）為五歲以內的幼童。</p>
<p>（2）中國每年中一千個產婦為了生產，要死亡十五人，一千個不滿週歲的嬰兒要死亡二百人。</p>
<p>（3）中國的入學兒童，其體格經檢查後，有百分之八十五發現缺點。</p>
<p>造成上述幾個驚人鉅數之原因，雖與經濟狀況亦有關係，然平時生活性形之不講衛生，實為最關切要，因為講衛生的英美等國，對於上述各項數目，都已比我們减少一半，所以我們為了這種關係，就訪（一）提倡產婦嬰兒衛生——實施產前產後檢查，新法接生，嬰兒診療，家庭訪視，婦嬰衛生會，學齡前兒童衛生會等工作——以减低產婦嬰兒死亡率，並减少五歲內幼兒之死亡數。（二）提倡學校衛生——實施體格檢查，缺點矯正，預防接種，疾病診療，養成衛生習慣等項工作——以防免兒童之疾病，增進兒童之健康。</p>
<p>兒童為未來主人翁，我們提倡衛生，應該以兒童衛生為出發點。</p>
<h3 id="c135">衛生運動與兒童健康 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>—為舉行第十五屆衛生運動大會告市民—</p>
<p>諸位！一年一度的衛生運動，現在又舉行了。可是我國目前的國勢，與國際間的一切情形。是如何的日趨緊張；我們决不能把這種衛生運動視為一年一度的具文，應該把這種工作。視為復興民族救亡圖存的目的。其途徑雖難很多，但是我可斷然的說，這種艱鉅的事業，决不是老朽昏庸疾病孱弱的人所能擔當得起的，一定是富有健全之精神的人方可勝任，可是健全之精神，必寓於健全之身體，而欲保有健全之身體，則必須先講衛生。</p>
<p>今年是兒童年，我們更應注意兒童的衛生。兒童為未來的主人翁，我們需要他們繼續担當救國的工作，我們便應該使他們先有強壯的身體，據南京市最近的生命統計報告，五歲以內的兒童佔全市人口百分之八，而五歲以內的死亡數，竟佔全市死亡總數的百分之四十五，我們中國人每年每千人中約死三十人，四萬萬人中每年約死一千二百萬人，若以南京市之五歲內兒童死亡數作比例，則每年全國五歲內兒童當有五百四十萬人死亡，足見兒童衛生之確屬重要了。</p>
<p>我們要提倡兒童衛生，就該注意下面的數點：</p>
<p>（一）實施產婦嬰兒衛生——植物之良否基於種子，人之賢愚強弱肇目兒童，而兒童之健全與否即基於胎產，故欲提倡兒童衛生，應同時實施產婦嬰兒衛生，庶幾自受孕以至分娩，自幼稚以至成人，無時不注意衛生，無時不受衛生環境之薰陶，則凡自出世以迄成人，其體格必甚健全。我國因衛生設施尚未普遍，鄉僻之處，大都不知衛生為何事，每年中孕婦因舊式穩婆不知人體生理與消毒方法，茫然接生，並因產前後不知護理方法，致死於產褥症者約有千分之十五，而一歲以內之嬰兒亦以同樣原因死於抽風（初生兒破傷風）及其他處理不當所引起之病症者約有千分之二百至二百五十，查世界各國嬰兒死亡率日本為千分之一三二，英國為千分之六六，澳大利衛生設備較優較優僅為千分之四二，吾國之嬰兒死亡率正與英國前二百五十年之現象相同，但現在英國已降至百分之十，此更足證明產婦嬰兒衛生之重要了。</p>
<p>（二）改善兒童環境——古語說，「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，兒童尤富於模仿性，當然應該注意環境之是否適宜。從前孟母三遷教子，孟子便成為古今來不可多得之聖賢，這就是得了改善環境的好處。</p>
<p>（三）注意兒童營養——兒童時代，身體尚未發育完全，對於營養方面，極應注意，假使營養不良，身體非但不能充分發育，並且會因缺乏某種養分而引起某項缺點以至日趨孱弱，疾病　生。據本市衛生局實施本市中小學校學生體格檢查之結果，有營養不良之缺點者約佔百分之十三，求學之兒童其家庭經濟較為充裕，尚且有營養不良之缺點，則失學兒童與流浪兒童之營養更可想見了。</p>
<p>（四）使兒童有良好的衛生習慣　古語說，『習慣成自然』又說，『性相近，習相遠』，足見習慣的好壞，對於養成人的品格是很有關係的，兒童有了好的衛生習慣，身體當然不期然而然的強壯起來了。</p>
<p>（五）普及健康教育　講求衛生，不一定要多費錢，或許會毫不破費，但是怎樣方合衛生？怎樣方可防止疾病？這不能不有一種相當的教育去教導他們一般不知道這種常識的人，尤其是兒童，更應該有受這種健康教育的必要。</p>
<p>（六）厲行兒童健康檢查　兒童身體之健康與否，往往非經詳細的檢查，不能明瞭，其有無缺點與缺點之所在，而施以早期的診治與矯正，本市中小學生體格檢查結果，患齒病砂眼者甚多，扁桃腺腫大者次之，營養不良者又次之，據衛生署調查全國八大城市中小學校學生體格缺點，患砂眼者約佔百分之五十二，牙病者四十一，扁桃腺腫大者二十五，淋巴腺腫者十八，營養不良者十四，視力有障碍者十三，此類缺點，事前若能預防，自可減少發現，但發現後，不論其情節輕重，若能施以相當方法矯治，必能恢復健康，或轉危為安。</p>
<p>（七）尊重兒童心理　兒童時代，雖年齡尚屬幼稚，見聞較少，思想尚不健全，然往往有其特殊之心理，一片天真，毫無虛偽，為之父母兄長老師者，應處處表同情，以至誠對待，並應隨時予以相當的鼓勵與啟發。譬如兒童發表其個人之思想或有所創作時，其自身必感覺興趣，斯時為父母兄長老師者，若抱成人之態度以成人之眼光哂為幼稚，或不屑一顧，或顧左右而言他，或吹毛求疵，或甚至施以責罰，此實為蹂躪兒童純潔心靈之殘暴無禮行為，必引起兒童之懷疑或發生惡感而阻止其思想之向上發展，兒童未來幸福，必受重大之挫折。</p>
<p>（八）舉辦學校衛生　從前的教育，大都祇講到一個『教』字，很少有人注意到『育』字上去，現在的教育已漸漸改變方針注意到『育』字上去了，舉辦衛生，就是使『教』『育』二字並重，凡兒童之環境，習慣，營養，以及健康教育，檢查體格，矯正缺點等項，皆可於求學時代在學校中注意及之，至於幼稚園之兒童衛生，當然亦在應行注意之列。</p>
<p>總之，兒童是民族的新機，是國家將來的主人翁；尤其應當注意為民族新機的兒童之健康。這是我對於本屆衛生運動大會的一點希望！　廿五年六月於上海，</p>

<p>— 沈誥</p>
<p>本屆衛生運動自五月初旬開始籌備，賴各方之贊助，參加各機關團體之協力合作，茲已就緒，定今日正式開幕。用將籌備經過及本屆運動特旨，摘要報告，或為各界所樂聞也。</p>
<p>本屆衛生運動　續上屆經騐，適應時代需要，其組織方面與上屆稍異者，計有本市新生活運動促進會之加入，而與衛生局同盡其相類之努力。緣本年五月初旬，該會接奉新生活運動促進總會通告，舉辦夏令衛生運動，嗣由該會指導員吳市長以衛生運動本市每年例有舉行，且本屆衛運雖彼時已近，故即論令合併辦理，而仍名之為十五屆衛生運動，經籌備會議之推舉，由衛生局及新運會分任本會主席及總幹事之職，總攬本屆衛運之籌備事宜。此次籌備委員　會之參加機關及團體甚夥，俱依會章推定職務，特列表如后：</p>
<h3 id="c137">衛生運動與民族復興 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 陳調元</p>
<p>衛生運動，為中央年來提倡七項運動之一，繼以　蔣委員長提倡新運，首重清潔，各地風行草偃。值茲夏令，上海市舉行第十五屆衛生運動，促進全市民衆健康，求人類的幸福，良堪慶幸。</p>
<p>中國衛生事業，至近代而日昌，人類生活上得一保障。這種保障我人生活的壁壘，隨時推進，於是人類的幸福，亦隨著衛生運動的進展面增加。</p>
<p>上海市衛生設備，愈見邁進。就飲料方面言，有良好自來水，民衆免受寄生蟲卵和細菌的傳染。營養方面之市售飲食品，受主管官廳檢查和取締，使人民不致受誤購餒魚敗肉的　慮。醫政方面，醫師，藥師，助產士，護士，必經考試和檢定，醫院，診所，藥房，藥商，又須受主管官廳之監督，保險制度，亦逐漸擴張，要無非以人民的幸福為前提。足見上海市對民衆公共衛生，已無微不至。</p>
<p>公共衛生，旣有相當的猛進。而家庭衛生，個人衛生，尤不容刻緩。須知衛生是保衛個人的生命，掃除一切污穢與一切致病之微生物。個人為社會一份子，不能離社會而生存，與社會所有的各個人或各個團體與國家民族，無時無地不發生相聯關係。使各個人皆有康健的身體，自強的精神，推已及人，相習成風，不特為我人強身之本，實乃強國之基。</p>
<p>方今國難日亟，謀我者日張我人為復興民族計，必須全體國民總動員，從民族健康改造，使人人有衛生的習慣，養成壯健的身軀，一掃老大病弱的風氣，必自踴躍參加衛生運動始。固知我人健強之基礎在衛生。衛生，乃為復興民族最實際而且最基本之要素。願共勉旃。</p>

<p>參加世運會的足球選手，早已出國，籃球和游泳選手還沒來滬，競走選手尙未發表；現在上海的只有田徑和國術選手。上海德國領事和市長吳鐵城特於昨日上午聯合假座大光明影戲院歡送。到的人很不少，秩序很嚴肅。目的都爲看看奧林匹克的歷史影片，我想。</p>
<p>十點鐘到了大光明，門內外擁滿了人，西人童干軍分佈在各個門口，有票子的人，滿得神地在兩邊「步哨」的威嚴的氣宇下走人內廳或樓；沒有票子都徘徊在門口。更有「蠻多」漂亮的女賓。</p>
<p>進戲院的門口，童子軍手拉着手攔阻在那裏。臨時由國泰戲院調來的「女嚮導員」，接了客人的票子，童子軍便把手　讓您進去，「女嚮導」便照你票子上的座號，領到您的座位上去。因之，門口的人老是擠滿着，大家却很客氣地，挨着先後，滿規矩的。</p>
<p>十點半模樣，近乎滿座了。女客並不比男子少。外國人也很多，大概都是德領事管轄，下的卍旗下的僑民，並有二三三名德國女學生。唯一的田徑女選手李森小姐，穿着深灰色印花綢旗袍，很樸實嫻雅的樣子，和劉長春王士林等一同進去的，直坐在臺前。無綫電不斷地奏着悅耳的曲子，奧林匹克開幕進行曲直奏到啟幕。臺幕的正中央　着紅底黑字的卍德國旗，兩邊是我國的黨國旗。闔座的人，都在做着「奧林匹克」的美夢。</p>
<p>十點三十五分無錢電裏奏出黨歌，闔座的人都「哄」的站了起來，歌奏得美麗極了，决不是我們在平常的樂隊裏所聽得的那們單調。黨歌完畢，坐了沒有一分鐘，又「哄」的都立了起來，外國男女和一羣女學生都斜舉着右臂，很嚴整地靜默着，恭敬在德國的國歌聲樂裏。</p>
<p>吳市長出現在黑黝黝的幕前，用國語演說，接着又是英語的自我　譯；兩種都是照着原稿讀的。一陣掌聲之後，又是一陣掌聲，活像「卡呑」畫裏的紳十穿着燕尾服的德國領事克里培氏踱了出來，一陣德語演說之後，又是英語的自我翻譯。以下是上海外僑體育界領袖白乃特氏，用最流利的英語演說，他想把所有的話語在一口氣裹說完，口齒很流暢淸晰，眞有他的。體育家總離不了體育家的態度，末後他說：「得勝，要做一個光明的得勝者；失敗，要做一個光明的失敗者」。末後是褚民誼博士出來了，穿着白式緊身上衣，白式馬褲，先用洋涇帮官話演講，繼續忽來一套法蘭西話，一切都顯着很別緻的樣子</p>
<p>演說完了，是國術表演。三女五男穿着一色的白紡綢衣褲從幕後出臺，先在臺上排隊開步走，由某一位先生在臺角指揮，這就是我國的出席世運的國術選手了。然後再個別的出來表演，或拳，或劍，或刀槍，或對打。我們巳知道了我們的國術選手出席世運是這樣玩的。外國人最歡迎對打，允其是刀槍對打，熱烈的掌聲震滿屋子。有一位耍「盤义」的，博得最多的掌聲，他也就要得更起勁。</p>
<p>電影來了，大家要想看看奧林匹克的歷史影片。開幕是幾幕「廢墟」鏡頭和戴花冠軍的勇士紀念塔，，這大概就是希臘奧林匹克發源的地方。繼續便是一八九六年後每一屆開會地點，用字幕表明，隱隱襯托一幕開會的景象。一九一二年後，忽現出一個十字架，矗立在烟慕迷漫中，這表示第六屆世運會在歐戰砲火下犧牲了。每一屆一個鏡頭，這大概就是歷史了。</p>
<p>歷史過去，便是現在第十一屆德國的籌備情形。先是一幕幕映出德國各處各地方的風景和柏林各種偉大建築。您要楚羨慕這些風景和建築，您就得上柏林去。此後是道次世運會的冬季運動的壯觀，和其他各種運動場的原址，奠基，和建築情形；每一幕的後面，隱隱襯托出未來競爭的情形，這些鏡頭都是用以前世運會的片斷影片接上去的，象微未來的熱閙情形。每頭鏡頭，都是很美麗的。</p>
<p>看完電影，所謂「奧林匹克歷史影片」我並沒有什麽印象。但德國人的辦事精神，和宣傳方法，使我佩服到了極點。（槐）</p>

<p>市敎局長潘公展在中央電臺講</p>
<p>（中央社）上海市敎育局長潘公展、應全國兒童年實施委員會之邀請、於十四日下午七時半至八時、在中央廣擴電臺播音演講、講題爲「兒童敎育與救國運動」、茲探錄講詞全文如下、</p>
<p>今天應全國兒童年實施委員會之邀請、向諸位作兒童問題的講演預定的問題、是「兒童敎育與救國運動、</p>
<p>中國在目前不能吾認、已到了非常嚴重的國難時期、而且是生死存亡的最後關頭、舉國上下、除了少數自願做漢奸、甘心做亡國奴者以外、沒有一個人不竭其全力、在謀國難的挽救、所負的責任、雖然有輕重、所任的工作、雖然有不同、然而進行的方向、和所企求達到的目的、却完全是一樣、換一句話說、全國人士、在此生死存亡的一剎那間、組成國家的每一個份子、都在各就自己的本位上努力、這已成爲全國一致的現象、本來救國之道、原非一端、只要各人各把自己的力量貢獻給國家爲國家努力、便將稱爲救國、</p>
<p>我們敎育界、担任的工作、是要培養未來的健全國民、爲國家樹立萬年不拔的根基、我們現在所處的環境、國雞旣如此嚴重、那末我們所需要培養的健全國民、當然是足以應付國難環境具有解除國難力量的國民、過去國難的造成、原因非一、我們且不必提起、但是未來國運的隆替却是挑在我們的肩上、我們的責任該是何等的重大、敎育者責任的重大旣如此、然而一般小學校實施敎育的情形又怎樣貼幾張標語喊幾句口號、或是來一個救國訓練週、和救國的大單元設計、就稱是無愧復興民族的敎育嗎、</p>
<p>我們該知道、這種沒有持久性的設施僅足以引兒童起一時興奮五分鐘熱度一過、效率便等於零决不是眞正的有效的切實辦法、也不能說便是我們所需要的救國敎育、故中常會主席胡漢民先生曾說、一多多注意力的準備、不要專作氣的發洩」、這實在是我們在國難時期實施敎育的金科玉律、一般小學校實施的敎育、便犯了「專作氣的發洩、這一個毛病、本來、救國工作絕對不是一朝一夕所可奏效、必須有繼續不斷的毅力去幹、才有成效可收、吾則空言救國感情用事、那裏有眞實的永久的效果可獲、具有救國力量的敎育、旣不是徒託空言所可收效、更不是一時興奮所得成功、那末究竟怎樣實施、才可以獲得圓滿的效果呢、一言以蔽之、是要在基礎上根本上、痛下一番、持久的長期的切實工夫、所謂「十年生聚」、（就是育）、「十年敎訓」（就是敎）正楚我們在此國難時期實施敎育的最好榜樣、我們此後便該本此精神、向前邁進、</p>
<p>一般人以爲國難時期的敎育、一定要另換一套新花樣、其實是不一定需要的、因爲我們中華民國的敎育宗旨、是「根據三民主義、以充實人民生活扶植社會生存發展國民生計、延續民族生命爲目的、務期民族獨立、民權普遍民生發展、以促進世界大同、這樣的敎育宗旨、本來已切合當今國難環境的需要、</p>

<h3 id="c154">戰費之發展及其推算 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>「一」最費腦汁之點</p>
<p>二十年前的火藥氣，自九一八事變發生起，就瀰漫了全地球。帝國主義的參謀本部，現已加工於戰時的經濟準備。爲了不要重蹈過去的覆轍，精密地組織着適於戰爭要求的經濟機構，廣大地充實着作戰的資源；同時又埋首在講求戰略原料之獲得，必要預備品之蓄積，以及如何喚起新規的生產。所謂戰時統治經濟，戰時產業動員，戰時財政準備，現在已部份地或全面地再各國展開着。而使他們最費腦汁，也最熱心研究的，即是未來戰費的推算。</p>
<p>本來，一國在投入戰渦之前，財政上最先要解決的問題，即是需要準備多少戰費？尤其在戰爭發生當初的緊急支出，非事前規劃，事前準備不可的。但究屬需要多少？這是一個重要的問題。再者，戰局展開之後，戰費的繼續支出，依照一般的情形，總是激急地增加的。但其增加的速度如何。而到達最高點時的高度又如何？這些也是重要的問題。雖然，這是要看未來戰爭的規模，及其戰局進展的狀態，才能隨機應變，適當決定。但事前也不能沒有一個大體上的概念。這是歐戰給他們的教訓啊！</p>
<p>過去，各國參謀本部對於大戰準備上的特徵，大都抱着速戰速決的政策。他們否定長期戰爭的可能性；認為最初數月間的戰爭，應當極度地緊張。若迅速得到勝利，就把一切經濟的困難問題，完全解決了。從而生出各種實際的效果：即全部熟練勞動者大眾的徵集，對農業之無限制的徵發，而最重要的希望，以被動員的預備品進行戰爭。他們以為戰爭本身，就能調整準備的。然而現實否定了他們的計算。爲了應付戰爭持久的條件，籌措不斷的龐大費用，於是不得不濫發紙幣，播種下戰時戰後通貨膨脹的一切惡果。不要重蹈過去的誤算，帝國主義的財政當局，便又重新鑽研過去戰爭上的一筆舊賬，企圖從中發現出如何能使財政的準備，可與戰局的展進，互相適應。戰費的推算，便成為他們最費腦汁，也最熱心研究的問題之一了。</p>
<p>這類問題，爲了環境上的迫不得已，現在也提到我們的面前了。然而無論如何，我們欲求精密爭取的預測，事實上總是萬不可能。惟有在可能範圍之內，就各國過去戰爭的實蹟，與自國戰時的經騐，推察將來戰爭的規模，以及今後物價的趨勢等等方面，而後從大體上去估計一個標準。有了大體上的標準，財政上的標準，才能有所依據；從而得以進行其所負的使命。</p>
<p>［二」三條途徑</p>
<p>普通估計戰費的貨幣額時，所用的方法，大抵皆循下列三條途徑進行。</p>
<p>全盤估計各次戰役所需的直接戰費，而依戰爭年代推算其增大的差度；於是推算未來戰爭，將較上次戰爭增加多少？</p>
<p>將同一戰爭劃分幾個階段，而後觀察其各時期所需的戰費多少，而決定各時期增大的差度；以便決定財政準備上對於開戰如期的緊急支出的費用，及於戰爭繼續費的增率，與到達最高點的程度。</p>
<p>依照過去的經騐，及其平時的軍事經費的實情，與自國社會生活的習慣，生活的程度，而推算每名兵士，平均在戰時，一日所需的戰費額；以至類推到全體在某一時期，或全時期的戰費總額。</p>
<p>同時，在估計未來戰費的時候，還注意到下列各種關係：</p>
<p>戰時經費與戰爭經費的不同。戰時經費，是包括通常的經費，此項經費，雖不能取消；但亦不得不盡量撙節與削減。戰爭經費，是純粹為維持戰爭而支出的。爲了要確保戰爭上的勝利，總是盡其所有而使之滿足。</p>
<p>各國生活習慣與生活費用的不同。參考別國戰爭的經騐，以估算自國戰爭上的需要；原是一個合理方法。因為戰術的陣容，雖各有其特點和秘密；但其趨勢，則大體一致的。不過關於各國社會生活的習慣，人民生活程度的不同，非加鑑別不可。譬如美國兵士的生活習慣，比我們奢侈得多；同時美國社會的生活程度，又遠較我們高。所以對於兵士的給養費用，就有很大的差別。</p>
<p>各時期物價的不同。在同一空間的物價，雖差不了多少；但在不同時間的物價，却變遷極大。如果我們根據歐戰時期的戰費做標準，則不能不注意到今昔物價變的差距。不特如此，戰時的物價，又必較平時昂貴。且同一戰時，各期的物價，也能發生極大的差異。因此我們對於戰費上的估計，也就不能不特別計及。</p>
<p>戰時財政的主要使命，是獲得代表戰費的貨幣。使用貨幣，才可獲得戰爭所需的物資。假使自國的戰爭物資缺乏，必須仰給國外。則又不能不估計到匯價與運費的等等變遷。</p>
<p>隨國家總動員而來的，經濟界要激起極大的變化。一方面是人心恐惶，整個經濟界陷入於混亂的狀態。另一方面是，平時的經濟組織，為適應環境的必要，一齊地轉變成戰時的經濟組織。如克服混亂的狀態，援助經濟組織的調整，都需要大筆的資本，且其數額，或不亞於當時所需之戰費。這雖不能包刮在直接戰費之內，但事前也不能不估算在內，而作相當的準備。</p>
<p>最後，還需要明白科學愈發達，戰費愈增加的關係。因為今後的戰爭，是集合近代技術的精銳，與敵國的勢力抗衡。上次歐洲大戰，便是用機械及工場生產力互相抗衡的標本。所以戰時的工業，便為適應茫無際限的戰爭之消費而生產，而毀滅；結果乃使戰爭費用，達於不能相信的數目。而此種現象，今後將愈為擴大。</p>
<p>［三」　一般趨勢的發展差度之推算</p>
<p>要採用第一種方法去推算，則先應估定近代以來各次戰役的費用。尼第Nitti曾將十九世紀以來，至歐戰為止的各次大戰費用，製成一張比較表。從中我們可以看到近代戰費發展的趨勢。（有▲記號者，是原表遺漏者）</p>
<p>（註）材料根據尹文敬非常財政論所引。　　根據Bogart，war　costs　and　their　financing　前者原為美金三十億元，以一美元等於一九·三美元分核算而得。後者原為美金七十億元，核算法同上。　參看拙著列強軍縮外交戰鬥史所引。世界書局出版原為七十五億日元，以一日元等於一二，七二法郎核算而得。　係根據賽列格曼E　R．Seligam所統計，原為二千一百零九億三千五百萬美金元。以同上方法合計。參看Essaysin　Taxation</p>
<p>這裏，已顯明地指出了各次戰費逐漸激增，而尤以現代為最劇的趨勢。可惜並未計算其每次戰費延長的日期，所以我們不能從中核算其每次戰費增加的程度。而且對於南北美等戰費之鉅大，對於逐漸膨脹的趨勢，似有不協調之處。關於這點我們　有利用鮑茄特博士Dr.Bogart注明戰爭日期的戰費表，並復核其每天戰費額的必要了。鮑氏原表中，尚有二次小規模的殖民　戰爭，而沒有歐戰的數字；這裏則把前者提出，另加以歐戰的記錄。不過歐戰戰費的推算，各人的數字有極大的不同。爲了使我們的推測，比較正確些計。所以這裏又把主要的幾種統計，同時並列着了。</p>
<p>近代戰費發展之差度比較表</p>
<p>（注）根據Bogart，war　costs　and　their　financing，直接戰費單位美金百萬元。平均日費單位美金千元。</p>
<p>Bogart前書及A　Study　of　the　Financing　of　the　war　and　the　aterwar　E.R.A.Seligman，Essays　in　taxation　Joseph　Kitting統計，原為三百八十九億英鎊，以一鎊等於四·八七美元合算而得。　日本杉村陽太郎統計，原為日金六十億元，以一日元等於四·九八四五合算而得。</p>
<p>從這張表裏我們可以得到如下的重要結論：</p>
<p>第一：在十九世紀中，當時軍器進步的速率，尚不及今日大；物價的趨勢，也比較今日安定。但是每次戰爭的戰費，都比上一次增加。其間的差度，最小是增加二倍。最大的竟有八倍。</p>
<p>第二：如果再將普法戰爭時代（十九世紀末期）的費用，與其四十年後的第一次歐洲大戰比較。則其增加的速度，尤為驚人。依鮑茄特博士Dr.Bogart的計算，增加十五倍。依賽列格曼教授Prof　Seligman的計算，增加九倍。依英國統計學家啟斯Kitting的計算，增加八倍。依日人杉村陽太郎的統計，雖為各家中所計算最小，也有五倍之多。賽列格曼的統計，是將戰時的國家經常費扣除，並其所根據的數字，又都是各國財政常局正式提出的報告，所以為一般人所公認為最近事實的，那末四十年的前後，便有九倍的差度了。而且事情還非常有趣（只好說他是有趣），在下面第六節中推算，爲了戰爭較歐戰的差度也有九倍的增加。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c155">非常時期的麥粉自給問題 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>我國南方食米，北方食麥，米麥同為民食之天，向來無分軒輊。但就目前情勢論：日本強化華北軍隊，國際風雲早非往昔的風調雨順了！民食前途，自亦有其非常的轉變。是以麵包問題，轉瞬將成我國非常時期嚴重問題之一！</p>
<p>在平時，我國小麥產量年約四萬萬担左右。（註一）但是因為農民留用與運輸不便的種種關係，據老於麵粉業者談：我國麥產，僅足全國粉廠六個月之用。致粉廠常有因原料缺乏而停工之慮。</p>
<p>在非常時期產麥的農地，因戰壕，公路，飛機場，堡壘以及其他軍事活動的佔用。無論如何，是足使麥產降落的。且現代的戰術，戰線的延長，往往是數千百里：新式的戰壕，非犧牲大量的寶貴的農地不克築成。在我們可能中的預測，至少有百分之十五的耕地為其佔用。假定這個預測是可靠的，那末我國的小麥產量勢必大受其影響。今試就中央膿液實驗所所估計公佈之二十四年度各省小麥種植面積，予以合算，則其耕地縮小的情形，當如下表：（單位市畝）（註二）</p>
<p>觀上表，可知耕地的縮小，直接便會影響到麥產的降落。而我國主要產麥的地域，在長江以北黃河以南的所謂中部四區。全國粉廠小麥的取給，也以中部四區的麥產為泉源。現在從非常時期的區域支配論：所謂中部四區，恰當非常時期的非常地域！萬一非常事變，其小麥產量的減少，勢必尚不止此數。</p>
<p>其次，於磨粉方面。我國粉廠在民國二十年時，全國共有八十五家。近數年來，以粉業的盛衰，沒有增減。據財政部稅務署的記載：二十三年度上半年全國粉廠共有八十九家，分佈於蘇浙皖區，魯豫區，湘鄂贛區以及冀晉察綏區等四區。年產粉量約在五千五百萬包左右。（註三）但是臨到非常事變，粉廠的建築物，是否能成復巢之下完卵？這是吾人極無把握的。即使萬幸而獲　常工作，但是原料的來源，勢必成為絕大問題。須知軍運忙繁的時候，那裏再有空閑的舟車來顧到你小麥的運輸呢？故即可開工的粉廠，其小麥必感「內運不繼，外輸不入」的困難！致巧婦難為無米之炊，不得已而被迫停工。</p>
<p>其三：在此種環境下，產區小麥因被軍運阻塞而不能運出，其價格勢必狂跌。不法奸徒，借此機會，便從中收買；企圖破壞非常時期的糧食組織。使市場原料缺乏，工廠被迫停工；工人失業，以冀達到擾亂後方治安為目的。</p>
<p>在另一面的麵粉消費者，因利其久藏便攜的關係，勢必大量增加。我們假定亦以百分之十五為麵粉消費者的增加率；那末不難推算在非常時期麵粉的需要量了。據財政部稅務署的記載：民國二十三年全國粉廠的粉產量是五五、二三二、〇〇〇包。（註四）今以增加粉產率百分之十五計算，則全國粉產，須有六三、五一六、八〇〇包。實際上這個數字，並不可靠；因廿三年洋粉輸入我國為五九五、七四八担；國粉輸入海外為六四、五七二担；兩相比較洋粉入超達五三一、一七六担。（註五）假使再將此數加入，無論如何，須有六千四百萬包的粉產，方足需用。</p>
<p>上述這個預測真能適合非常事變的需用嗎？這是未免太輕易了！須知我國民間的麥產，農民是不會逐粒逐粉的搬運到市場上來給加工者磨粉。據上海社會經濟調查所徐佩琨先生的估計，全國小麥運達粉廠磨粉的，祗限於我國中部四區交通便利農村的全部麥產的百分之十五。（註六）其餘的小麥，都係農民留作自用。茲將農民留用小麥，列表如下：（單位千擔）</p>
<p>普通小麥一擔，可製粉兩包。農民廿三年留作自用的小麥，數達三一五、七二八、二五〇擔：內中一部份小麥當係種子，一部份小麥當係製酒之用。但至少有三萬萬擔小麥磨粉，為自己磨粉的原料。假定以三萬萬擔小麥磨粉，那末再須有六萬萬包的麵粉可以生產出來。衡之我國的人口來分配，此數亦似符合。從上述推想，非常時期的粉產，決不是粉產出數所夠需用的。</p>
<p>綜合上論。在非常時期的麥粉問題，決不是平凡的問題了。我們用什麽手段來調整麥粉自給？用就嘗見所及，貢獻末議如左：</p>
<p>一　限制民間小麥留用數量；</p>
<p>二　實行小麥聯保分儲制度；</p>
<p>三　調整麥粉運輸；</p>
<p>四　利用民間磨坊調整磨粉工業；</p>
<p>五　制定麥粉法定價格；</p>
<p>六　　行麥粉定額分配制。</p>
<p>（註一）據實業部中央農業實驗所估計，二十年全國小麥產量為三九八，〇四〇，〇〇〇擔，二十一年為四一一，一二〇，〇〇〇擔，二十二年為三九六，二〇〇，〇〇〇擔，二十三年為三七一，四四五，〇〇〇擔。</p>

<p>— （徐天）</p>
<p>星期日的下午，閒着沒事，於是決定去做「馬路巡閱使」。沿着吳淞路走，信步所之，走到三角小菜場的附近，看見賣白糖梅子的孩子。他右手提着一隻筐子，裏面盛着青梅子，左手的另一籃子裏，盛着白糖梅子，旁邊有三個六七歲大的西洋孩子，他門嬉皮笑臉的用手向那盛白糖梅子的籃子裏，撈起一二個梅子來，向那孩子逗引着，或者向着地上亂拋。那賣梅子的孩子，顧此失彼，防了這個搶，防不了那個偸，要罵他們又聽不懂，哭又哭不出，虧得旁邊的阿媽看見喝住了。</p>
<p>咳！這還不是一幕「強凌弱」的縮影嗎。</p>
<h3 id="c164">唐家灣巡禮 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>棕色的大油布傘下面，衝喊着「黃魚賣十鈿一兩啦！」那麼沒結沒完的。</p>
<p>沒結沒完的，大夥兒見都這樣喊着，賣茅笋的，賣鳥魚的，賣芹菜的，賣……的，菜場裏每一攤子都希望着主顧們上來。那可憐的，盲了一目的，賣豆片的老太婆，孤零地縮在牆角對每個提菜籃的男女叫着「先生」「奶奶」…種種尊稱。可是，人們都沒給注意地溜過了。有時，伊更聽到。</p>
<p>新蠶豆出世，誰還吃你這種老豆片呢？」這類刺心的話。</p>
<p>在擁擠的人湖中，有着大戶人家的娘姨，商行的飯司務，小戶熱價的奶奶，作場老闆娘，在大油布傘下面，討價和還價的唇舌，市秤和一十八兩的爭執，添一把搶一把的吵鬧，新鮮與不新鮮的互辯，這就形成了唐家灣的熱鬧。</p>
<p>街沿石上，襪子的堆，零頭布　的堆，汗衫的堆……喊賣「叫貨」的喉嚨是粗大爾響亮，吸引了短裝的工人，大姑娘，和一些貪便宜的老實人，一角錢一雙絲光錢　，三分錢一尺陰丹士林，一塊大洋三件麻紗開衫。看得人多，買的人依舊少。大規模的「洋布店」亦掛出「買一送二」的牌子來了，無機電［唏嘩唏嘩］叫着，樓窗口的洋號和大鼓，和菜市上的喧嘩鬧成一片。</p>
<p>一聲怪叫，那孩子手裏的麻球兒擲翻在地上了。安南人的臉上全是青筋和橫肉「小赤老，中國低階去……」在腦勺上一棍。黃色爾有油光的麻球，輾轉糊於卡車鄧樂普的輪胎下了，血本呵，血本呵，小販的血和淚……</p>
<p>像這樣的事太多了，不算稀奇。</p>
<p>「簡便食堂」裏面老實有一些吃客在嘆息的，「車租，照會，乘客的精刮……」的討論。那全是人力車夫，三個銅子一碗什麽「鮮湯」，七個銅子一碗飯，白色磁鐵碗碟，在設備上的確清潔，然而，這对于车夫们還是「無關宏旨」的。他們的要求僅是價錢便宜，然而平民的食堂究竟太少了，這一點，應當推崇唐家灣。</p>
<h3 id="c165">黃昏時的江灣路上 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>時間是不在早上，不在白晝，不在黑夜，僅僅在很短促的一霎那間的黃昏。</p>
<p>氣候是不在括雪的冬天，不在炎熱的長夏，也不在吹風下雨的日子，是在初夏晴好的天氣裏。</p>
<p>那江灣路沒有南京路那末的熱鬧，也沒有四川路那般的神秘，更沒有霞飛路那般的富餘異國輕佻。一條平坦的柏油路上，除了有定時的公共汽車駛過以外，極少有旁的車輛駛過。行走的人呢，除了幾個肩挑的鄉人以外，也沒有其他閒逛的人。至於風景方面，除了高矗的幾所洋房以外，四周滿是碧綠的田野。真靜寂極了，也可說怪有鄉村氣息的一條路。</p>
<p>可是那條路上，有部少的大學和中學。每逢黃昏時候，他們和伊們總是三三兩兩的散步着。有的吹起口笛，哼着最新的情歌，有的喁喁談話，評論着別人的好歹，也有　着水果嚼着花生米的，也有騎着自轉車兜風的，也有……，此外，竟說不　　　的花樣。概括的說一聲：「他們和伊們，快樂，活躍，自由……，竟和「天之驕子」一般。」</p>
<p>在這一　快樂的天使中，不論難得和女的，戴着深光眼鏡，穿着藍布大褂的人總是號稱「道學先生」的同學。挺括的西裝，灑上很多的香料，這是愛好交際的同學，女的上身穿了翻領衫，下身套上了男式燈籠褲：男的短褲長襪，　衫的袖兒，高高的捋起，露出堅強的肌肉，這是人人注目的運動家。穿了寬大的西裝，頭髮蓄得長長的，而又故意　着出一副浪漫態度的人，這是一定是未來的藝術家和音樂家。還有種種不通典型的人物，恕我不能一一的描寫了。總之，都是在這條路上踱着，談着，笑着，咬嚼着。</p>
<p>夜色漸漸的深沉，他們的金殿中，伊們的深宮中，一齊電炬大明。於是這一大批的王子和公主，齊給這大建築物吞了進去；江灣路上又恢復了剛才的靜寂。</p>
<h3 id="c166">徐家匯路的初夏 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>一條修長而又寬闊的徐家匯路，下半截像一個蓬頭垢面的鄉村姑娘，上半截却像一個體態苗條的都市小姐。</p>
<p>我為了愛慕都市小姐，便於月前搬了家—從它的下半截搬到它的上半截—恰恰搬在最嫵媚最美艷的一段，房屋是簇新新的，馬路是柏油的，還有馬路的兩旁，齊齊整整的樹木，現在夏天來了，那碧綠葉兒，一天長大一天，隨着初夏的威風，時時在飄拂着，然而，恐怕不是在飄拂着吧。也許是在微微地含着初夏的笑吧，有些時候，—早晨，中午，晚上，　　有少數鳥兒，在枝頭吱吱喳喳地　着，倒又好像在替我鳴着不平，我心里的愁悶，一股腦兒都在它們的嘴里，像少婦繅絲般統統替我抽盡，並且還轉送我一些新鮮的，歡喜的，甜的萝。真的，那碧油油的樹葉，已經被太陽晒出許多雙亮眼，那幾雙亮眼，反射出萬道銀光，使我分外地感覺得歡欣。</p>
<p>黃昏到來了，太陽隱　了，這時候，我老是走出門來獨自在馬路上碟　，見上面綠陰遮蓋陌生的男人，或女人，來來往往，有點忙得像螞蟻，然而他們去了，我也就讓他們去了，來了，就讓他們來了，和我全不相干。</p>
<p>等一會，黃昏的味兒，忽的漸漸地淡淡薄起來了，黑夜來侵吞整個世界，自然這一角，這渺小的一角，——徐家匯路最嫵媚，最美艷的一段，也是一樣地，黑　下來，遠遠近近的街燈，一點點，一點點，微微地在吐露着光芒！</p>
<p>路上，徐家匯路上，行人慢慢兒稀少了，周遭包圍着岑寂，這時候，初夏的微風，帶着初夏的氣息，陣陣地相送着，送我一直到了家，我就輕輕地關上了門。</p>

<h3 id="c167">立達學園養雞場訪問記 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 雅菲</p>
<p>我國農村破產，雖說由於天災人禍，和重重壓迫與剝削的摧殘，可是農村的副業不發達，實在也是一大原因；所以我覺得我們要救農村，除了其他種種建設應該改進外，提倡農村副業，委實也是一椿急不容緩的工作。</p>
<p>昨日，我倒江灣去參觀了立達養雞場，它是為立達學園所創辦的。歷史頗久，而一二八時該場也會經一度炮燬。他們對於農牧事業有過相當的貢獻，現除此養雞場外，尚有南翔一個閱藝場及農村服務部，松江及嘉興也各有一個養蜂場。關於農牧的書籍和器具，該園出品也很多。</p>
<p>養雞場是在江灣立達路，佔地甚廣，那場裏除了有十多間高達的雞房外，還遍補着各種菓樹，紫雲英，蔬菜等。紫雲英是供蜜蜂採花的，蔬菜乃是喂雞的飼料。裏面現在共有種雞三百多頭，計意大利種：「萊克亨」，「魯烏紅」，美國種：「排紋洛克」，土耳其種：「虎雞」及雜交種等。至於中國雞，只有蕭山雞一種。</p>
<p>萊克亨是純白色的，此雞在雞中要算最優良了。牝雞每頭約五六斤，產蛋極勤，平均每年能產蛋三百個左右，可產六年。牝雞身有七八斤重，每頭能同時配交牝雞十多頭，也可用五六年，所以飼養者當以萊克亨種為宜。然而萊克亨種雞雖佳，却易患病，故最好養「雜交」種。——此種就是以萊克亨牝雞與蕭山牝雞交配的，但其第一代種似有些　異，須至第三代，其毛色及蛋，方能與萊克亨一般，而體格却能和蕭山雞一樣康健了。</p>
<p>我們參觀過了每一個成年雞房，又到育雞房去。那是一個用木板建築的屋子，比成年雞房高大，育有雛雞數百隻，分四組飼育；計一星期，二星期，三星期及八星期。每一組均　有保姆溫暖器，和保姆溫度表；其濕度約在九十度以上。日夜有人管理，壁上有統計表一張，隨時都可記錄和檢查。</p>
<p>這裏飼雞所用的水器和食譜，全是特製的，它有防垢及不使雞　爭奪的設備。飼料方面，日常的主要飼料是大麥，麥麩及珍珠米粉，此外還有牛股粉，牛奶粉，魚粉，肉粉，蠔壳粉，蠶蛹等；然而青草蔬菜之類也是日常必需的飼料。</p>
<p>最後我們又到孵化室參觀了一週。那是一間不十分寬大的屋子，內有三架熱水孵化機，一架桌上孵化機，熱水孵化機每次可孵蛋二百五十枚，桌上孵化機一次祗可孵蛋五十枚，均用科學方法孵化，其孵化時間約需三星期。</p>
<p>據說雞場以前原有種雞，千多隻，共十多種，自從被戰事所毀以後，因管理的人不負責任，故至今未能恢復，現已更換管理人，並計劃今年將增至一千隻云。</p>
<p>我參觀了足足有二小時之久，並由郭君引導及解釋，故所得印象極為深刻。</p>
<h3 id="c168">東山綠豆餃 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>三年前北浙江路有一家洞庭土產公司的開設，據說會經把故鄉的綠荳餃煎着出賣過，可是聽了這消息跟老祖母上那邊想嘗嘗這故鄉風味的綠荳餃，不巧的很，那家公司却已關掉了。</p>
<p>在故鄉比較熱鬧的街上，總會瞧到這麼烟霧騰騰的綠荳餃攤在那裏煎賣，攤主總是老婆婆或年輕的娘兒們，一邊放了隻黃沙小行灶，一邊放了座小盤磨，沒主顧就座在攤邊剪「紙銅細」，有主顧則半匙兒半匙兒水浸退了皮的綠荳舀着緩慢地磨成一碗粉，跟着就在那隻平底的鍋子裏煎賣啦。</p>
<p>綠荳餃是當作一樣名貴的點心的，有客來，一杯碧蘿春出泡茶之外上街煎一盆綠荳餃來敬客，比如你明天要出遠門你的親戚也會送你一「黃藍」作路上的幹點心。假使你閒在家裏沒事做，儘克獨個兒上街來一杯白乾兒再煎一盆綠荳餃坐着攤半邊跟攤主老婆婆邊喫着談閒天，好在費不了多少錢，小的一隻銅元兩枚，蛋的連個蛋也不過十來枚。</p>
<p>我挺愛喫綠荳餃，尤其愛喫蛋煎的。記得小時候拿了家裏蛋桶子裏的蛋獨個兒偷偷地拿上了街煎餃喫，媽發覺蛋少啦，確定的，是我拿了去煎餃的，給媽罵，挨打是常有的事。沒喫到綠荳餃已經好多年了，還是在那年族裏輪到我家回鄉春際上祖墳的時節，計算起來已是整整地四年了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二回　芳草　人天微波乍托　小　明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>夢蘭想不到會在這裏遇着他，一時倒沒有了主意，只得垂了頭，藏刀樹後身去。章唳天道：我送你的花，也沒有別的意思。因為你把我在各雜誌上做的小說，都搜羅盡了，實在是我的知己。我很知道，你是一個守舊禮教壓迫的姑娘。我很同情於你。但是這不要緊，現在不是共和國家嗎。我們可以自己振作起來，去追求我們的自由。夢蘭本想答復他兩句話，可是總免除不了女孩子們的常態，紅了臉，低了頭，無論如何，說不出話來。却聽到章唳天歎了一口氣道：人生求一個知己，到底是很難呵！夢蘭聽了這話分明是他表示出來失望了。因掙扎着說出一句話來道：你以為我不是你的知己嗎？大概你的文章，只要發表出來的，我沒有一篇沒看過的。說時，向外張望着却看不到了章唳天。轉出樹來，才見他將杏花背在身後拿着，閑閑的走上了山頭一座亭子裏去。那亭子分明是雨花台上的一座，也忘其所以的追了上去。然而自己到了亭子上時，却沒有一個人，四望天空地闊，風呼呼的向身上吹來，把衣服全已掀動，自己急得只管把手去接衣襟下擺。可是風吹得很厲害，怎麼按也按不住，心裏一着急，睜開眼來，那裏有柳樹，那裏有雨花台，原來是一場夢呢。先前貪看月光，窗子是不會關閉，風直送到床上來，所以把衣服吹動了。坐起來揉揉眼睛，只見那輪月亮，盤子那麼大，掛在碧空。天上除了兩三顆大星，陪着月亮週圍，却是一點雲彩也沒有。走到窗子邊向外看，人家的屋脊，全沉沉在月光之下，那棵夢中的柳樹，帶了一層翠光在半空裏微微的搖擺着，似乎在那裏說，姑娘我看見你作夢了。再抬頭看看，天彷彿更亮了，月亮小得又像個銀餅，樓外是一片寒光，略帶了烟霧。和遠去若有若無的樓閣相連。樓裏面沒有燈，月光照到樓板上，涂上一塊四方的銀漆。光反射着書架子上的書，花瓶子裏的花，以至於床上的被褥，都添上了一種幽媚的意味。耳邊上不聽到人聲，却是樓下院子裏芭蕉，被風擺動了，唆唆作響。再低頭看院子裏，樹影子黑沉沉的，倒反像是夢境。一個滿腔心事的人，剛由夢裏出來，不能不發呆了。（三四）</p>

<p>— （徐州朱暢之來函）</p>
<p>編者先生。這是我對於醫藥上的一個實驗報告。請你在貴刋登出。以利同病。想你總可允許的。事實是這樣。內子是三十多歲的人。在少女時代。身子是很強健的。嫁後十年中。因為連產了幾胎。身體就減弱了。而且得了一個胃痛的毛病。幾年來。這毛病要年發數十次。真是苦痛不堪。也不曉得何以種下了這病根。醫也醫不好。從去年起。不知是身體衰弱了呢。還是有著別種原因。無端又下起很多的白帶。初時還以為一時的。那知好幾個月後。仍然如此。一個柔弱的女子。怎禁得如許病魔的摧殘。幾處訪醫問藥。最後經友人的介紹。才在上海同仁西藥社購得『胃必靈』藥粉兩盒。及內服和外用的兩種白帶藥各一盒。先後服用。不多幾天。非但把新起的白帶病醫好。而且把數年來胃痛的痼疾。也根本治愈了。這種一試即靈的良藥。實在是難得。而且是值得介紹的。敢將經過紀録下來。做一個患實的報告。</p>

<p>— 敬</p>
<p>我前天看報，見北平學生準備示威運動新聞一則，不免心中有些難過，便寫了「北平學生示威運動感言」一個題目，題目寫了之後，又欲下筆為文，困難的問題，便湧現在我腦筋中了，我若贊成這個舉動，非特不能，且亦勢所不可，此不能不可的理由，請讀者原諒，恕我不明白奉告了，我若反對這個舉動，天然不滿意於一般讀者的心理，以為到此地步，還欲反對此種行動，我的血未免太冷了些。</p>
<p>但是題目已竟寫好了，文章不能不做，於是决定了意旨，調轉了筆鋒，把前天的文字寫了下來，這篇文字的意思，再容我聲明一番！愛國的心理，日恕我放肆，借時髦人的口吻說句話，天然不敢後人，比較愛國學生的心理，還要嚴重，但我自問，國是無從愛起的，也是無法愛起的，因而把愛國的心理，淡了下來，還是去愛學生，並且看到或者想到歷屆愛國運動的形勢，一次悽慘一次，效能一次减少一次，並且現在的平津，是怎樣一個平津，在兩重勢方壓迫之下，恐無喘息的餘地，還有你們示威的地方麼？於是不知不覺地，在題目之中增加了「不必」二字，題目之上加上了「敬告」二字，感言二字也只得宣告撤消了。</p>
<p>不料此文發表後，邊接「金」君「嘉哉」君兩封信，均責備我持諭不當，和措辭的荒謬，我所最荒謬的一段文字，今天再自行檢舉出來，向「金」「嘉哉」兩君告個罪。</p>
<p>語曰，國家興亡，匹夫有責，愛國之心，人所同具，正為愛國之心，人所同具，所以學生不必單獨示威，若云責任，則政府之責任，畢竟十百倍重於學生，則政府之愛國心，當亦十百倍於匹夫，學生亦何必自尋煩惱，而為此越俎代庖之事耶。</p>
<p>這段文字，我做的時候，已知道荒謬，自經「金」「嘉哉」兩君提出詰問之後，我重讀一過，自己也更覺得荒謬。</p>
<p>幸虧這是一個報屁股，說得對的，旣無人相信，依據施行，說得不對，也便一笑了之，請讀者不要看得十分認真，至於我文中有風凉話三字，也從這裹出來，所謂風凉話者，便是不負責任的話，也是沒有價值的話，我的意思如此而已。</p>
<p>但是用別一種眼光的看法或解釋，則責任所在，更覺分明，我此刻不必再畫蛇添足，重來申明矣。</p>

<p>我害怕起來了：整整一年啦，打家里出來。回頭望望這不算短的道路，真使我膽怯的心　慄了。</p>

<p>「請批評」的雜誌拿過來我想得到一點安慰。但是，當看到第三行的時候，我底眼睛不自禁地合起來了，握著書的手也像棉花一樣的軟綿無力，書沉重地落在枕邊了。好，就暫時安安心吧，休息一下也是不晚的。一個成日勞動的人他是怎機需要休息呀，我又是把腦子跟肉體合一地去作活，實在該好好地歇息一下的。但是，我不能就睡覺，我想閉一閉眼，待會兒再讀書。</p>
<p>一陣汽車底鳴聲使我醒來了。</p>
<p>我還躺在床上，書枕在我底頭下。身體一點力量沒有，我不知道死亡是不是僅只比這更沒力些。</p>
<p>汽車過去了：帶著夜的寂寞的風，向著遠方。</p>
<p>衖堂里靜悄悄的，一點聲音也沒有；四周是死了嗎？沒有，巡捕底皮鞋響了：Kang，Kang，…但，這聲音里包含著的不是什麼美，而是擾亂別人極需要的安靜。那樣單調而煩燥的聲音呵！</p>
<p>我躺在床上，望望燈，它寂寞而又膽怯地放著光。屋外邊就是黑暗的空氣，冷汽不時地吹進來，燈影無定地搖幌著。我想到人死後的靈堂：那陰沉而又神秘的屋子…我還想到那一位當看門人朋友，他現在已經四十歲了，這四十歲的一半的時間他消費旅途上，又從松花江越過一條山走到一個新的國度里去；他在松花江一帶的一座充滿了異國情調的小埠上做看門人。那時，他正窮是當然的，每夜他在更深時分，一個人總是撥弄著他底終年的友伴：那一件可愛的「吉他」！用帶著感傷與熱情的調子唱著新學的詩句。他是一個詩人，一個被流浪的生活迷　著的詩人…</p>
<p>在我們　堂里看門的卻是一位山東人。　，無　是說話還是辦事情，我沒有過什麼好感。</p>
<p>就聽他那單調而煩燥的聲音吧：Kang，Kang，…</p>
<p>我想支撐起身子來把窗子關上，一是擋擋風，主要的還是隔絕這聲音。</p>
<p>我希望不要有誰打擾我，讓我好好地回憶一下這一年來的生活。但是我一動也不想動。眼睛巡逡著臺子上的，椅子上的東西，以及　壁上掛的照片跟月份牌，都好像很親切似的陪伴著我，而且，他們好像許久沒見我似的問著我晚安的樣子。想抬手去拂摸一下他們，然而沒有力量。我就又不自覺地閉上眼睛了。　　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c176">關於撲面香粉之事實 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 三花公司撰</p>
<p>問：如何測騐而香粉品質之高下？</p>
<p>答：必需加以兩種測騐，第一為測騐其質料之精粹無害。此惟設備完善之化學實騐室內方　為之。第二為憑自己個人之測騐。卽由女界就面膚上以騐之是耳。故選購撲面香粉時，務應注意二大要素，卽品質之精粹，與其施於面膚上之成績是也。</p>
<p>問：如何判斷撲面香粉之品質？</p>
<p>答：凡撲面香粉必須含有極純粹之成分，必須在技術精巧之管理下製成者。又須牢附面膚，令其足以避免風日塵埃之侵吹，並適於乾燥，油膩，又普通一般之皮膚。且更須能為面部云除油光　「雪　」之美。</p>
<p>問：何以鼻頰兩部必須格外敷粉？</p>
<p>答：因此二部分最易發汗，此種情形，惟用含有吸收汗氣之成分以及牢附搶救無效久之面粉方可矯正之。美商三花公司精製之香粉。含有此種特別成分。故最為適用。</p>
<p>問：面香粉足以陰滯膚孔否？</p>
<p>答：此應視所用之面香粉如何而定。劣質面香粉，其粉體與面部自然之潮潤接觸時便卽脹大，故在夏季撲用此種劣質香粉，尤易阻滯織細之膚孔，至用三花公司之香粉，則絕無須顧慮此種劣質成分也。</p>
<p>問：面香粉在面上何故往往凝結？</p>
<p>答：劣質面香粉常有此種現象。其原因有三。一因粉中缺少吸水性質，汗液乃將面粉變為糊狀之薄層。二因粉中含有澱粉，一遇汗濕便卽膨脹，而使面膚呈花斑之現象。至第三原因尤為普遍，卽多數面香粉均不能牢附面膚，致易被凝結。故不時須重復撲粉，粉層自然堆積不勻，而在夏季為尤甚。通常如用適當之香霜作為粉底，自可穩收勻滑之效。</p>
<p>問：吾女年十六歲，姿膚秀麗，如用面香粉，未知足以損傷其而容乎？</p>
<p>答：此則亦視所用之面粉如何而定，上等面香粉，非但無損面膚，且能保護皮膚，其於年輕之女子，如欲保持青春之明媚，此種保護實尤為需要。</p>
<p>問：面香粉對於乾燥及油膩之面膚，其影響如何？</p>
<p>答：香粉內有牢附之品質，則足以保護之。蓋乾燥之皮膚，最宜避免風日塵埃之侵吹。換言之，卽力避招致乾燥之原因是也。至於油膩之皮膚，除由牢附之面粉保護而外，並需要一種特別之粉質，務使油膩不使面膚浮起油光。上述兩種特性。則均為三花公司精製香粉中為效之一部分。</p>
<p>問：在未實地試用於本人面部以前，有何法决定某種粉色為最合諧本人之膚色乎？</p>
<p>答：購買面粉時，如需决定某色，而又不除去原來之粉妝，法可取粉撲施於手臂腕節之上部以定之。此種測騐。最能令人選得最適宜之粉色。但如服裝之顏色變化時，則所用之粉色。有時當然亦需諧和粉色，以資配合。</p>
<p>問：何時須深淡兩種粉色兼施並用。</p>
<p>答：例如施深色之香粉於面部輪廓，可使其望之較小。鼻部太大者，如所敷之粉較面上其他部分較濃，則鼻可望之較小。面孔太窄者，其眼鼻相交之部分，如施以淡色之粉，便可以改正。至面部橫闊者，大可取濃色之粉沿髪部施之。自可减少橫闊之程度矣。</p>
<p>問：如何為畫眉之最佳方法？</p>
<p>答：畫眉時，先將眉旁粉跡除去，次用畫眉筆畫一細線，宜略向上向外，描一長劃。如天然眉毛太短，宜稍延長之，但須將眉梢延展，微斜向上，如此則兩目間望之可以較闊。</p>
<p>問：口唇膏如何可以用之盡善盡美？</p>
<p>答：口腔全部顯露最為美觀。故所謂「愛神之弓式」應任其充分明顯。嘴唇薄者。可多施口唇膏於上唇，以資矯正。其下唇厚者，則粉綫應上移少許。塗唇膏時，宜先塗中部，向外移塗，漸塗漸淡。如用三花公司口唇膏。則唇部可以更為濡潤柔軟而鮮麗。此乃今日時　之所趨者也。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Xiao Focheng, Lin Yunhai, and others discussed the issue of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee at Xiao's residence on the 14th morning, and a decision has been made. A joint meeting of party, government, and military officials will be held on the 15th to discuss the matter. It is rumored that another important telegram will be issued. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway ceased transporting troops for departure starting on the 14th. The situation is gradually easing. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Weizhou said in Hong Kong that Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Feng Zhuwan, and others would go to the province to cooperate, but Jiang, Cai, and others have no intention of going. Chen returned to the province on the 14th. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the Guangdong-Guangxi order for troops entering Hunan to withdraw south, Liao Lei's troops returned to Quanzhou, Xia Wei's troops reached Qiyang, Wu Jianxiong's division of the Guangdong Second Army reached Rucheng and Yizhang, Li Zhenliang's division reached Jiufeng, Huang Zhiwen's division returned to Pingshi and temporarily stationed there, and Yu Hanmou's army remained in southern Jiangxi, slowly returning to northern Guangdong.

Changsha Island is the location of foreign companies and residences, and is currently peaceful. Only posters criticizing the Guangdong and Guangxi soldiers are visible everywhere. After the news of the Guangdong army's strict discipline in Chenzhou spread, general concerns for the two American Presbyterian Church workers in the "danger zone" have been greatly reduced. Currently, the Clark and Ballard couples are the missionaries in Hengzhou, the Deal couple and Dr. Sterlingham are the missionaries in Chenzhou, and one missionary family has already departed for Guangzhou on June 11th. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) The Guangdong and Guangxi armies sent troops to Chenzhou, Qiyang, and other areas in southern Hunan, advocating resistance against Japan. After telegrams from various parties advised unity and awaiting orders from the Central Government, the situation has changed. According to telegrams from various parties in southern Hunan, Tan Bing, the magistrate of Qiyang County, wired that the Guangxi army had retreated to Yongzhou via land and water routes on the morning of the 13th, and there are no longer any Guangxi troops within Qiyang County.

<p>(Nanjing) The situation today is certainly more calm regarding the national situation. The Guangdong troops are stopping at Chenzhou, and the Guangxi troops already having reached Qiyang, it is rumored, also agreed to retreat. However, the deployment of rear defense forces remains tense. General speculation is that the Guangxi army stopping advance indicates their sincerity. It is still hard to predict. Foreign reports that the central government and Guangdong will conditionally compromise are unreliable. The government has not yet made a decision to send personnel to the south. The purpose of the visit to the north by Feng Rui, the director of the Guangdong Department of Agriculture and Forestry, is unknown here. It is said that he has a representative mission. The opinions of Guangdong and Guangxi can be considered, if and only if they are in line with the central government's policies. At the very least, the invading troops must agree to withdraw from neighboring provinces by a set date as a prerequisite. The central government has not given up on peace with Guangdong and Guangxi. Although the military affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi have already been initiated, the Ministry of Finance has not received an order to suspend the monthly subsidy of 600,000 yuan to Guangdong. Cadets sent by Guangdong and Guangxi to Beijing to receive training in various schools, including infantry, artillery, engineering, transport, and communications, are all active-duty soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi. After the military affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi were initiated, approximately 50 cadets from Guangdong in Beijing are still receiving training as usual, going to the Guangdong garrison office every day to inquire about news from their province. It is rumored that a small number of cadets from Guangxi have been ordered to return to their provinces. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">A Turning Point in the Turmoil of Guangdong and Guangxi <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Since the news of the Guangdong and Guangxi troops halting their advance has spread, the unsettling situation on the Hunan border has calmed down, and the anxious atmosphere has eased. In addition to our burning anxiety, we also feel that the hope of reconciliation has not been extinguished, and it is not difficult to return to unity, stopping the fighting that has already begun and transforming hostility into peace. This can be said to be a blessing for the future of the nation and the country.</p>
<p>The disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi began less than half a month ago. Although their public slogans were intended to avoid civil war, given the importance of the matter, it was easy to involve misunderstandings. The slightest error can be amplified a thousand miles. Not to mention the many voices that are like melting gold, only to fuel conjecture, even if everything is clarified, it is difficult to expect everyone to understand it thoroughly. Once the two sides lose their temper and go to extremes, it will become internal strife. Those who treat others as a snipe and a clam and regard themselves as a fisherman have already been laughing secretly from the sidelines. The original intention was to save the country, but the result was counterproductive. How could those involved have anticipated this? Fortunately, both sides are able to be aware of the current national crisis and strive to eliminate discord. The central government has spared no effort to offer repeated advice, and all parties have been exchanging letters in order to maintain peace. In the end, this has been able to turn the views of the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities and lead to the withdrawal of troops from Hunan. In today's dangerous situation, only unity can resist foreign aggression. How can internal strife be allowed to hasten destruction? The entire country has probably deeply understood this meaning, so it has been able to pull each other together and save the overall situation from danger. Perhaps there will be a further understanding of the meaning of unity from now on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some say that although the cessation of the advance of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies has been confirmed, the process is still not clear enough to convince the public. Some speculate that they are changing course to other locations or that they have other plans. Such rumors can be ignored. We only hope that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, based on the meaning of unity, will make more concrete expressions: one side should withdraw troops to their original defenses in the shortest possible time, and the other side should select responsible representatives to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, express their loyalty in planning for the country, and jointly plan for the great cause of national salvation. They should not repeat the trick of "朝四暮三 (giving someone four in the morning and three in the evening)," causing us further disappointment. The central government should also sincerely consider the difficulties of the times, adopt public opinion, and use a unified pace to respond consistently. If they stop at the brink of the precipice and mend the fold after the sheep is lost, then wouldn't this small setback be equivalent to firmly establishing the cornerstone of sincere unity?</p>

<h3 id="e19">A Brief Biography of Zhang <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A brief biography of National Studies Master Zhang Taiyan is as follows: Zhang Taiyan, named Binglin, originally named Jiang, was a native of Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province. He was born in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty (1868). In the late Qing Dynasty, he studied under Yu Yue and also inquired about learning from Huang Yizhou, adhering to oral learning. Because he read the "Donghua Records" and unofficial histories of the late Ming Dynasty, he embraced racial ideas. He studied the "Zuo Zhuan" and was recognized by Governor Zhang Zhidong of Hubei, who recruited him into his staff in the spring of the Wuxu year. He enjoyed talking about revolution and clashed with Liang Dingfen, so he returned to Shanghai to write for the "Changyan Bao." When the Wuxu Reform Movement arose, he sought refuge in Taiwan because he had written for the "Shiwu Bao," and wrote to caution Kang and Liang not to be loyal to foreign races. In the Jihai year, he traveled to Japan and met Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and they talked very compatibly. In the Gengzi year, he cut off his queue in Shanghai to show his determination. He then took refuge in Suzhou and lectured at Soochow University for nearly a year, which was discovered by Governor Enshou of Jiangsu. He fled to Japan again. In the Renyin year, he, Qin Lishan, Feng Ziyou, and others launched the 242nd Anniversary Memorial Meeting for the Fall of the Nation in Tokyo, and he personally wrote the declaration, which inspired many students studying abroad. In the Guimao year, he, Liu Shipei, Deng Shi, Huang Jie, and others founded the "National Essence Journal" in Shanghai, promoting national culture and advocating the restoration. When the Patriotic Study Society was established, he wrote for the "Subao," advocating revolution and expelling the Manchus. Because of his preface to Zou Rong's "Revolutionary Army," the Qing court launched a major purge, and he and Zou were imprisoned in the Western Prison. During his three years in prison, he delved into Buddhist scriptures and also wrote for the "China Daily" in Hong Kong. In the Bingwu year, he was released from prison and invited to Japan by the Tongmenghui, where he took charge of the "Min Bao." He often discussed matters with Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei at Mr. Sun Yat-sen's residence and gathered about twenty Chinese students in Tokyo to lecture on national studies. After the Wuchang Uprising in the Xinhai year, he returned to China. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen welcomed him to Nanjing, where they met with great joy. He then went to Beijing, where Yuan Shikai hired him as a high-level advisor and subsequently appointed him as the special envoy for border affairs in the three northeastern provinces, but he did not take office. Three years later, he married Ms. Tang Guoli in Shanghai. After the Second Revolution, he returned to Beijing. At that time, Yuan stole the country, and because Mr. Zhang did not work for him, he imprisoned him. Five years later, after Yuan's death, Li Yuanhong released him and presented him with the four characters "束南樸學 (Puxue of Eastern Southern)." In the fourteenth year, he founded the "Huaguo Magazine." In the same year, he traveled to Hubei and Hunan to lecture and then returned to Shanghai. In the twenty-first year, at the invitation of his students, he traveled to Peiping. He returned south that summer and moved to Suzhou in the autumn. Colleagues loved to gather the National Studies Society and invite Mr. Zhang to lecture. In the twenty-fourth year, due to differing teaching philosophies, he established the Zhang's National Studies Lecture Hall and gave lectures year-round, and also founded the "Zhiyan" bi-monthly, which was supported by the central government with 10,000 yuan. Zhang was extremely knowledgeable in all books and was a master of writing. He did not favor Song poetry when discussing current affairs, and his study of phonology and etymology was extremely refined, revealing the essence of language and writing. His original work, "Zhang's Collected Works," was published. In the twenty-second year, his students published a sequel in Peiping. He lectured for nearly forty years, and his students were all over the country, the most famous being Huang Kan, Wu Chengshi, Zai Dong, Zhu Xifu, and Qian Xia. Kan died of illness last autumn. Mr. Zhang is currently sixty-nine years old. His wife is Ms. Tang Guoli, and he has two sons and three daughters. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zai Dong, the Dean of the College of Arts at Central University and a highly accomplished student of Zhang Taiyan, was deeply saddened by the telegram about Zhang's death. On the evening of the 14th, he went to Suzhou to convey condolences to Zhang's family and discuss funeral arrangements. When the reporter visited Mr. Wang, Wang said that Mr. Taiyan's death was the greatest misfortune for the academic community in our country and an irreparable loss. Last year, Mr. Ji Gang passed away, and now Mr. Taiyan has passed away as well. My mood is very confused, and I cannot express even one ten-thousandth of his life's deeds. However, Mr. Taiyan's national studies, writings, and meritorious revolutionary deeds have long been well-known domestically and do not require me to say more. Wang also said that last year, Mr. Zhang was invited by the academic community in Beijing to lecture, but it was interrupted due to a nosebleed. The central government sent Ding Weifen to express condolences and sent 10,000 yuan for medical treatment. Mr. Zhang used this money for lectures in Suzhou. Although he gradually recovered, his health continued to weaken. He had a long-standing asthma condition, which worsened. Due to the severity of his condition, his family telegraphed Mr. Zhang Puquan in Beijing on the 14th to describe his condition. Zhang was in Shaanxi, so Ding Weifen went to Suzhou to visit him. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 14th, he received a telegram from Ding stating that Mr. Zhang had passed away on the morning of the 14th. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Treatment Process <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Mr. Zhang Taiyan, a master of erudition, currently residing at No. 50 Jinfan Road, Suzhou, passed away today (the 14th) at 8:00 AM due to nasal mycosis and cholecystitis, at the age of 69. A description of his illness and a brief history are as follows:</p>
<p>In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang moved from his residence on Tongfu Road, Shanghai, to a newly built house on Jinfan Road, Suzhou. He founded the Zhang Family National Studies Lecture Hall and published the "Zhiyan" bi-monthly, which became famous nationwide. Many people came to Suzhou to attend his lectures. Prominent figures in Suzhou, such as Li Yinquan, Zhang Zhongren, Chen Shiyi, and Jin Songcen, also strongly supported Mr. Zhang's National Studies Association. The central government provided Mr. Zhang with ten thousand yuan in funding last year. After establishing the National Studies Association, Mr. Zhang also advocated for national salvation through education, which was supported by those advocating for the revival of ancient traditions. This spring, Chen Jitang of Guangdong also sent representatives to Suzhou to invite Mr. Zhang to teach at the Xuehai Shushe in Guangdong. Mr. Zhang declined due to his advanced age and inability to travel. At the same time, the central government also considered inviting Mr. Zhang to preside over the National History Museum, which he also declined. Due to his advanced age, Mr. Zhang would only accept invitations from schools and organizations in Suzhou to give lectures occasionally. He could not stand for long, so he had to sit while lecturing, which would often cause him to pant. Mr. Zhang had suffered from nasal mycosis for nearly twenty years, and numerous treatments had been ineffective. In the past four years, his asthma had worsened daily, leading to a decline in his physical strength. Two weeks ago, a fungus in his nostril suddenly fell off, and he immediately felt unwell and had a poor appetite. Starting on the 13th of this month, he began to experience chills and fever, with his temperature reaching a high of 105 degrees. Initially, he consulted Xie Jianxin, a chiropractor, for massage therapy. Subsequently, Yu Yunxiu, a doctor from Shanghai, came to Suzhou to diagnose and treat him, along with Western doctors Wang Jidao, Lin Sumin, and Sun Jianyi. They diagnosed his condition as cholecystitis, malaria, and complications from nasal mycosis and asthma. However, Mr. Zhang was inherently active, so that day he still went from his bedroom upstairs to the reception room downstairs to talk to people. Li Yinquan, a recluse from Xiaowang Mountain, and Ding Weifen, a committee member in Beijing, came to Suzhou to visit Mr. Zhang upon hearing the news. Unexpectedly, at 7:45 AM today (the 14th), Mr. Zhang passed away suddenly. When Mr. Zhang was on his deathbed, Ding Weifen, Li Yinquan, colleagues from the National Studies Association, his wife Madam Tang Guoli, and his children were all present. Because Mr. Zhang did not think he would die immediately, he did not prepare a formal will. However, Mr. Zhang had told his friends and disciples that he hoped that after his death, they would find a way to permanently maintain the Zhang Family National Studies Lecture Hall that he had established, so that the national studies he had devoted his life to could be passed on. Currently, his friends have established a funeral affairs office at Mr. Zhang's residence and are sending telegrams to relatives and friends at home and abroad to announce the death. The coffin will be sealed on the 16th. The funeral arrangements will depend on the agreement after his close friend Zhang Ji comes to Suzhou. Mr. Zhang's surviving family members include his wife Madam Tang Guoli, two sons, the eldest Zhang Dao, 20 years old, currently studying at Datong University in Shanghai, married to Peng, the second son Zhang Qi, 13 years old, and two daughters, the eldest Zhang Zhuo, deceased, the second Zhang , married to Zhu Jinzhou, currently the Director of the Finance Department of Gansu. Mr. Zhang devoted his life to the study of national studies, was proficient in phonology and etymology, loved the Spring and Autumn Annals (Zuo Zhuan), and strictly adhered to the teachings of his teachers. He had strong nationalistic sentiments and admired Liu Bowen's assistance to the Ming dynasty in overthrowing the Yuan dynasty and restoring the Han people. Therefore, he had said before his death that he wished to be buried next to Liu Bowen's tomb in Wenzhou. His works include "Qiuyan," "Zhang's Series," "Supplement to Zhang's Series," "Xuelin Yayan," and "Jianlun," among others. Zhang Binglin's original name was Yi, with the courtesy names Meishu and Taiyan. He was a native of Yuhang County, Zhejiang. In his youth, he studied under Yu Quyuan (Yue), a great Confucian scholar in Zhejiang. He once took the county examination but dropped out due to illness. He then abandoned his ambition for an official career and devoted himself to the study of national studies. At the age of twenty-seven, he joined the Qiangxuehui initiated by Kang Zuzhao and began to write articles for Shanghai newspapers, expressing his opinions. In the year of Bing Shen (1897), he and Liang Qichao were responsible for writing for the Shanghai Shibao. In the year of Wu Xu (1899), he entered the staff of Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Hubei, and then served as the editor-in-chief of the Changyan Bao. He was wanted by the Qing government due to political persecution and fled to Taiwan. In the year of Yi Hai, he met Sun Yat-sen and discussed revolution, opposing Kang Youwei and others' protection of the Qing dynasty. In the year of Geng Zi, he joined the Shanghai Guohui and was again wanted by the Qing government. He then sought refuge at Soochow University, established by Christians in Suzhou. Due to his radical essays, he was again resented by the authorities. In the year of Xin Chou, he polished translations at the Guangzhi Bookstore in Tokyo, Japan. In the year of Ren Yin, he and Feng Ziyou initiated a memorial meeting in Tokyo for the 242nd anniversary of the fall of China. In the year of Gui Mao (1903), he served as a writer for the Shanghai Guocui Xuebao, advocating nationalism. He and Zou Rong wrote "The Revolutionary Army," which again incurred the Qing government's resentment. He was arrested by the authorities of the foreign concession and imprisoned in the Western Prison for three years. After being released from prison in the year of Bing Wu, he served as the editor-in-chief of the Min Bao and traveled to the United States to promote the Xinhai Revolution. After returning to China from the United States, he was summoned to Beijing after the establishment of the Nanjing government in the first year of the Republic of China. Zhang was very dissatisfied when Sun Yat-sen ceded his position to Yuan Shikai. He then resided in Shanghai until he moved to Suzhou in the 23rd year of the Republic of China and formed the National Studies Lecture Hall. He passed away on June 14th of the 25th year of the Republic of China. (June 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Doctor's Report <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from this City) Regarding the news of Mr. Zhang Taiyan's death, according to Dr. Yu Yunxiu's report, on the 12th (Friday) morning, he received a phone call from Suzhou saying that Mr. Zhang was ill. He went to Suzhou in the afternoon, around 3:00 PM, he had a slight fever (37.1 degrees Celsius) and chills, felt nauseous, and had some tenderness and resistance in the upper right abdomen. His tongue was brown and extremely dry. He had had a poor appetite for more than a month, and there was a suspicion of stomach cancer. However, because he had had a gallstone attack several years ago, it was also possible that the gallstones had recurred. At that time, he prescribed antipyretic, pain-relieving, appetite-stimulating, and heart-strengthening medications. When he was about to return to Shanghai (6:00 PM), he re-examined him and found that his fever had risen and he was vomiting, but only a small amount of mucus was vomited. He originally planned to go again on Sunday, but on Saturday he received another phone call saying that he had a high fever and chills, so he was asked to go for a consultation immediately. Due to his busy schedule with patients in Shanghai, he could not leave in the afternoon. In the evening at 8:00 PM, Mr. Zhang's third daughter (Mrs. Zhu Duomin) returned from Suzhou and said that the fever had subsided, he was asking for food, and his mind was clear, but his pulse was faster. So he decided to go to Suzhou early Sunday morning, but he had already passed away. It was said that after the fever subsided, he had another bout of chills and high fever up to 41 degrees Celsius after only a few hours. Doctors from the North Pole Hospital injected heart-strengthening drugs all night to maintain him until about 7:30 AM on Sunday morning, when he passed away. Doctors in Suzhou suspected malaria (but no malaria parasites were found in the blood test, but only tested once) or a recurrence of gallstones. Due to the rapid and violent onset, his advanced age, and weak heart, he passed away suddenly. A definite diagnosis was difficult. Also, during the chills and fever on Saturday morning, at about 10:00 AM, he suddenly had difficulty breathing and almost passed out. He then vomited a piece of something that looked like meat but wasn't. His breathing immediately returned to normal. Doctors in Suzhou examined it and found that it was a nasal polyp that had fallen off and entered the throat from the nose. It was said that Mr. Zhang had suffered from nasal polyps for more than ten years and had had surgery twice. (June 14th)</p>

<p>The Japanese Military and Foreign Ministry are United on China Policy: The Abolition of Eastern Hebei Requires Considerable Study</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sangshima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, will visit Song Zheyuan at the Foreign Affairs Building tomorrow morning to exchange general Sino-Japanese opinions. On the morning of the 16th, he will accompany Shimizu, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy, to Zhangcheng by Japanese military plane for inspection and will return to Beiping that night. Song hosted a banquet for Sangshima and Sugiyama Gen, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army, as well as Nagami, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, and Matsumuro at the Summer Palace this afternoon, inviting Qin Decun, Chen Juesheng, Shimizu, Okuda, Hamada, and others to accompany them. Sangshima said that he had been away from China for three years and that the situation in China had changed a lot. The purpose of his visit to China was to inspect the latest situation in China and provide reference for future work. His planned itinerary includes Jijing, Pinglu, Jiqing, and various places in Shanghai and Beijing, and then he will return home from Shanghai. He had already met with Tashiro and the chiefs of staff in Tianjin and listened to their statements on the current situation in Jizhou. The local Chinese authorities in North China should seek the happiness and stability of the people in their current political affairs, and the Japanese authorities should also assist in their efforts. Most of the cotton used by Japanese spinning mills is purchased from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Egypt. If Chinese cotton is improved and sold to Japan, it will not only improve the lives of the Chinese people, but also promote the economic cooperation between Japan and China. The relationship between China and Japan must be adjusted. According to his observation, the goal of comprehensive adjustment can be achieved in the future. Regarding the issue of personnel in various departments in North China being responsible for negotiations, the Japanese military and the Foreign Ministry have a consistent policy toward China and there is no distinction. The situation in North China is special. Whether the military or the Foreign Ministry is responsible for negotiations, they act in unison. In his opinion, the Eastern Hebei issue should be merged with the Hebei-Chahar government immediately. In principle, it cannot exist permanently, but the timing of the merger of the two governments requires considerable study before it can be realized. Although the increase in the number of Japanese troops stationed in North China has caused panic among the people in various parts of China, it is actually for the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese. He asserted that the Japanese side has no intention of armed aggression. (Special Dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Sangshima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, met with reporters from Chinese newspapers today, someone asked whether Tokyo's policy on North China was handled by the Foreign Ministry or the Army Ministry.

<p>(Nanjing) Inspector General of Customs Meierhe replied to the Ministry of Finance that, after investigation, gold bullion is valuable and small in size. If merchants hide gold bars tightly on their bodies, it is not easy for customs officers to detect them. Therefore, those who transport gold into and out of various ports often hide them on their bodies in an attempt to avoid customs declaration and the procedures for requesting a guarantee from the chamber of commerce. The government strictly handles the transportation of gold bullion by merchants. If anyone fails to comply with the regulations, the customs can confiscate the gold bullion they transport and turn it over to the public. Now, in order to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants, and for those who have no definite evidence of attempting to smuggle gold overseas, it is proposed to handle the matter leniently and impose a fine of 30% of the value of the gold bullion they transport and exempt them from confiscation.

<h3 id="e35">Canceling Sanctions Against Italy: "He Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It." European Countries Request the UK to Take the Lead. The UK's Attitude Awaits Formal Decision. <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) A general movement to cancel sanctions against Italy is underway in Europe. It is reported that European capitals have telegraphed London, requesting the British government to take the lead in proposing this. At the same time, diplomatic representatives of European countries have also notified the British government that member states of the League of Nations consider sanctions to have failed and are only waiting for the UK to initiate their cancellation, since their implementation was originally proposed by the UK. Czech President Benes stated that the Czech Republic remains a firm supporter of collective action but feels that it is now imperative to cancel sanctions and allow Italy to return to the League of Nations. However, the Czech Republic is unwilling to take the lead in proposing this, as it believes that this is the responsibility of the UK and France. It is reported that the attitude of Soviet Russia is even more definite. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stated that the danger in Europe today stems solely from Germany's militarism. Italy is now willing to join the common front of resistance, and the threat of sanctions must be terminated. Litvinov also requested the UK to set an example, as the implementation of sanctions was mainly promoted by British Foreign Secretary Eden. At the same time, British Foreign Office staff are currently busy drafting a plan to reform the League of Nations. It is reported that this plan is based on the establishment of regional agreements, so that Geneva is no longer responsible for handling regional disputes. It is widely believed that the UK may submit this proposal at the next League of Nations General Assembly meeting. It is reported that at the meeting of the House of Commons next Monday, some members will ask Foreign Secretary Eden about the Prime Minister's recent remarks in the House of Commons regarding sanctions against Italy. Political circles now feel that diplomatic affairs should be debated as soon as possible, and journalists close to political circles now believe that this debate will be held on June 22, and there is information that it may be held even earlier.

Revising the League of Nations Covenant. As for the reports in some newspapers tonight that there is a significant disagreement within the cabinet regarding the sanctions issue, and that a small number of cabinet members oppose Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's proposal to cancel sanctions, well-informed sources indicate that this may not be true.

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina: Rumors that the Argentine government's recent request for an early convocation of the League of Nations General Assembly was at the behest of a certain major power have been scoffed at by officials, who said that the government's actions are fully in line with the principles it has traditionally adhered to. According to this agency's reporters, the Argentine government will issue a declaration explaining the country's position at Geneva. The main points are that Argentina does not feel interested in the colonial issue and does not wish to interfere with the solution of the Italy-Abyssinia problem. Its only goal is to cooperate in maintaining world peace and maintaining its long-standing friendship with both the UK and Italy. As for whether Argentina is willing to recognize the established fact of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia after the League of Nations General Assembly is convened, and whether Argentina proposes to maintain or strengthen the current sanctions, there is currently no definite news.

<p>(London) Air Secretary Lord Swinton delivered a speech at Lock Park near Bobby City yesterday, discussing the international situation.

The obligations undertaken by the signatory countries of the League of Nations Covenant must be fully fulfilled. Some say that the League of Nations has failed, but this is not the case. If the League of Nations can be based on realistic circumstances, it will not fail. Otherwise, failure is inevitable. If the general non-realists force the League of Nations to do what it cannot do or what it does not want to do, then the League of Nations will undoubtedly fail. Lord Swinton then mentioned the issue of regional mutual assistance agreements, saying that this agreement would not only not be weakened but could gradually be strengthened. "In short, the actions we should take diplomatically and defensively are to make the League of Nations an institution that is consistent with reality, and our national defense can also meet our needs."

Barbers reached an agreement with their employers this morning and will resume work tomorrow.

<p>(Paris) The Standing Committee of the United General Confederation of Labor recently issued a notice to newspapers, stating that all trade unions have won victories in raising wages and signing labor contracts on behalf of workers, and that the promises made by the cabinet to the people before taking office have also begun to be fulfilled. "A new social policy has now been born. However, in order for this policy to fully develop so that the wishes of the working class can be realized, employers must abide by their promises, and workers must understand their responsibilities. What are the responsibilities? That is to abide by the agreement, work peacefully, and maintain order." It also stated that hundreds of thousands of workers in various industries have enthusiastically joined trade unions, and that as of now, more than 2.5 million workers belonging to trade unions have received union cards, which is very gratifying. Finally, the announcement also stated that certain groups, especially right-wing veterans' organizations, namely the Croix-de-Feu, are attempting to form independent trade unions. These people are enemies of liberalism and the republican system, and their intention is to alienate the working class in order to reduce its strength. All workers should be wary of them.

<p>Radio Broadcasts Alarming Rumors, Government Troops Deployed to Prevent Unrest</p>
<p>Caracas, Venezuela: Government troops have today controlled key locations in Caracas and Maracaibo because the general strike against the Public Security Law has endangered the oil fields throughout the Maracaibo area. Most of the oil fields have been shut down, but striking workers are still marching in the streets of Maracaibo, where troops are deployed. (Thirteenth National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Caracas, Venezuela: The general strike in Venezuela has been going on for some time, and today it has spread to the oil mines, resulting in a sharp reduction in oil production. The authorities had severely revised labor laws, which are now opposed by strikers. At the same time, there are no trams or buses running in Caracas, and it is difficult to maintain the operation of bakeries. Strikers have set up secret radio stations to spread alarming and unfounded rumors, but the authorities have been unable to find their location. (Thirteenth Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>Madrid: After the recent general strike in Malaga, 65 miles northeast of Gibraltar, the situation is extremely serious, but after the government disarmed the people and sealed off the headquarters of the labor unions and anarchist party, the situation has greatly eased. Today, when a civilian group was patrolling a village in Cordoba, they were shot at. One person was seriously injured. The civilian group set fire to the house where the shots were fired and shot at the people who escaped from the house. Although they were all injured, there were no reports of deaths. At the same time, the usual bullfights were held in Madrid on Sunday. Due to conflicts between Mexican and Spanish bullfighters, they have been suspended. Spanish bullfighters are on strike because Mexican bullfighters earn more in Spain than Spanish bullfighters earn in Mexico. (Fourteenth Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Feeling the Threat from the Soviet Union, Japan Plans to Actively Expand its Military <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Minister of the Army Terauchi Plans to Advise Hirota; Soviet Forces Increased to 1.3 Million; Far Eastern Military Industry Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the Soviet Union has actively expanded its military in the Far East, which has drawn great attention from the Japanese Army. In order to consolidate national defense and cope with this move by the Soviet Union, there is a strong sense of the need to quickly strengthen military preparations, and at least to realize and strengthen comprehensive national defense capabilities in the shortest possible time in order to cope with the situation. At the time of the Manchurian Incident, the Soviet Union had only about 500,000 regular Red Army soldiers, but this year it has increased to 1.3 million, and it is devoting all its efforts to strengthening new weapons. This year's military budget has reached 14.8 billion rubles, and efforts are being made to expand the powerful air force and accelerate the tank forces, with approximately 5,000 aircraft and 4,000 tanks. The total force will reach 100 divisions, forming an unparalleled military force. After completing the double-track engineering of the Siberian Railway, the heavy industry and power generation areas in the Far East will also be completed, so that most of the weapons and military supplies in the Soviet Far East can be self-sufficient. The Soviet Union's expansion of its military and completion of military facilities is clearly aimed at Japan, and Japan's preparations in this regard are very weak. If this trend continues, the Soviet Union's military dominance in the Far East will greatly increase, which is inevitable. It may bring significant obstacles to Japan's future, which cannot be ruled out. Therefore, Japan should respond to the heavy pressure of Soviet military preparations with great determination and increase military preparations as soon as possible, which is unavoidable for national defense. The Army authorities will proceed with a firm determination based on the above conclusions in order to achieve the goal. Recently, Minister of the Army Terauchi will present this opinion to Prime Minister Hirota. (Fourteenth Allied Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e50">To Cope with the Pacific Situation, Taiwan Governor-General System to Change to Military Official System <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Naval Authorities Strongly Advocate, Nomura and Kobayashi are Highly Likely to Succeed</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the entry of Taiwan Governor-General Nakagawa into Tokyo, the Governor-General's resignation and the issue of his successor have become more prominent, and the government's measures have attracted attention from all walks of life. The actual hope of the Navy authorities for this issue is to have the current military official appointed as Governor-General. Because the naval forces of the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably pursue their active policies in the Pacific due to the natural expiration of the Pacific defense limitation clause, Japan must cope with this matter and ensure the security of the South. This is an urgent matter to overcome the extraordinary situation. Therefore, if the position and authority of the military Governor-General are not upgraded, such as the current Governor-General of Korea under the command of the Minister of Colonial Affairs, transforming into an independent personnel administration, then the true rule of Taiwan is impossible. Therefore, it is advocated to first amend the official systems of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. As for the successor of Governor-General Nakagawa, Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo and Admiral Kobayashi Seizo are the most likely. (Fourteenth Allied Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Japanese Army Ministry Announces Border Conflict Incidents <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Eighty-Two Incidents in Five Months; Plans to Demand Russia Withdraw Troops from the Far East</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry announced on the 13th the statistics and contents of the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia and "Manchukuo"-Soviet border incidents that occurred from January to mid-May of this year. According to the statistics, there were 35 incidents on the eastern border, 27 on the northern border, 4 on the western border, and 16 on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border, totaling 82 incidents, an increase of 47 incidents compared to 35 incidents in the same period last year. The military is very concerned about the sharp increase in border disputes and is considering appropriate countermeasures. The reason is that since the inspection by Gaganochitchi, the Soviet military in the Far East has rapidly strengthened its military preparations and completed its fortresses this year. It is well aware that it is in a far superior position to Japan, so it does not hesitate to try. Therefore, if the Soviet Union does not withdraw its military from the Far East, such incidents will continue to occur in the future. In view of this, the military feels that the Treaty of Non-Aggression proposed by the Soviet Union has no security guarantees whatsoever. The most effective solution to eliminate disputes is to invoke Article 9 of the Treaty of Portsmouth, requiring the Soviet Union to abolish artillery positions and set up an demilitarized zone within 50 miles of the border line. Otherwise, the only way is to make the power of the two countries on the border equal. There is no other way. (Fourteenth Allied Telegraph)</p>

<p>Japan Pays Close Attention to Military Operations in Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>The Sightseeing Group Will Transfer to Guangzhou and Guilin Provinces</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Recently, the atmosphere in Chaozhou and Shantou has been quite tense. Troops stationed there are concentrated in Xingning, Jiaoling, and Xunwu, which are dangerous passes on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, and important guards in the upper reaches of the East River and Han River. At the same time, the authorities have added important officials to inspect postal and telegraph services, and ordered various agencies, people's organizations, schools, etc. to strictly prevent vagrants from colluding with reactionary elements to operate in Chaozhou and Meizhou. Military police people's regiments, district and township offices in various counties are constantly inspecting suspicious residences in the district, and are not allowed to leave foreign guests to stay. If strangers enter the countryside to do business, if they are considered suspicious, they must be immediately arrested for questioning. On the 6th, the Shantou Municipal Government, because the Guangdong Army has moved towards Xiang and Gan, convened representatives of various talents (that is, the instructors of various associations and trade unions sent by the Party Department) to hold a meeting to plan military actions in response. The Japanese in Chaozhou and Shantou attached great importance to it, fearing that taxable goods would be subject to strict inspection.</p>
<p>A Tainan Economic Inspection Group of more than 30 people came to Shantou on the Fujian Maru during the day. It is reported that the purpose is to investigate the economy of South China, and they want to sell tobacco, cigarettes, and other goods in Guangzhou and Shantou. There are also educational inspection groups organized by teachers from various schools in Taiwan and sightseeing groups, etc., who will pass through Shantou in turn and transfer to Guangdong and Guangxi for sightseeing. Each batch has about 20 to 30 people. In addition, because Guangdong and Guangxi are engaged in military administration, Gutian Fusi郎, a military and political figure in Japan, and a group of 26 people came to Shantou from Xiamen on the 10th, and also went to Guangdong and Guangxi for inspection. The Shantou Municipal Government, after receiving a notice from the Japanese consul, protected them. Japanese torpedo squadron commander Hosogaya visited Shantou Mayor Chen Tongchang with Japanese Consul Harada on the 6th. In the afternoon, Chen Tongchang also visited Hosogaya on the Yubari warship with Councillor Huang Jing.

<h3 id="e62">Shandong Province Improving Cotton and Silk Conditions <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Extending Cotton Fields by 400,000 Mu</p>
<p>This Year's Harvest is Over 9,000 Dan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Construction Department is making considerable efforts to promote cotton and silk business at the end of the year. Last year, the department issued improved cotton seeds of Jinzi Cotton (East Shandong) and Duris Cotton (Northwest Shandong) to the cotton-suitable areas of Qidong, Gaoyuan, Boxing, Putai, Binxian, Huimin, Shanghe, Linyi, Deping, Xiajin, Gaotang, Linqing, Qiuxian, Guantao (Northwestern Shandong), Gaomi, Pingdu, and Changyi (Eastern Shandong). About 2 million catties have been sown and planted. It is estimated that this improved cotton seed will yield 100 catties of seed cotton per mu in the 17 counties this year, which can yield 30 catties of pure cotton, for a total of 40,000 dan of seed cotton, which can produce 120,000 dan of pure cotton. The Construction Department borrowed more than 1 million yuan from the bank to distribute to the cotton spinning cooperatives in various counties, and then lent to the cotton farmers to activate their economy. Instructors were sent to various counties to guide them to make their organization and management rationalized, and a cotton ginning and packing factory was established in Qidong to help its operation. If the weather and climate are normal this cotton season, and there are no special blows, the harvest will definitely be as expected in the budget. Calculated at a price of 40 yuan per dan, it can obtain more than 4.8 million yuan. In the past, the total cotton output in Shandong Province was only 1.8 million dan, worth more than 12 million yuan. The income from cotton spinning in the province this year has increased several times more than before. It is also heard that the Construction Department has a predetermined plan, and it can be extended to more than ten times next year. However, I am afraid that the bank will be suspicious of the loan due to the current situation, and there may be difficulties in not being able to maximize it. In the past, the silk-producing areas in Shandong Province, such as Linzi, Zhoucun, and Yidu, mostly transported machine-made silk overseas, earning about 4 million taels per year. The tussah silk in the coastal counties such as Fushan, Laiyang, Muping, and Qixia can also earn 1.5 million taels every year. Later, because overseas markets were gradually invaded, it suffered the same fate as Zhejiang silk. The Construction Department immediately devoted itself to the improvement of silkworm eggs and silkworm feeding, with Linqu as the center, and prepared to gradually promote it. A silk drying workshop was established in Linqu, a silkworm silk improvement center was established, and cooperatives were established. There has been a great improvement in recent years. Last year, 40,000 improved silkworm eggs were purchased from Zhejiang, and 1,000 eggs were distributed to Linqu and Qingzhou. Now it is the orchid flood season, and it is estimated that 9,400 dan of orchids can be harvested, worth 25 yuan per dan, for a total of 235,000 yuan. It is estimated that it will be expanded to 100,000 sheets next year, and the total income will be even more considerable. However, another silk drying stove must be added to meet the needs. In addition, the wheat in Jiaodong this year has been quite affected by "Dan disease", and the harvest is expected to be 60 to 70%. Many people are harvesting now.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Hunan Province's Attitude Toward Guangdong and Guangxi <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>He Jian sympathizes with resisting the enemy and saving the country, but insists on central leadership</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Guangdong and Guangxi declared their intention to resist Japan and send troops to Tingzhou, the people of the whole country have been greatly shaken, and the three towns of Wuhan are especially concerned. This reporter recently learned that Liu Huarui, advisor to the Hunan Pacification Commissioner's Office and concurrently the provincial government, had arrived in Hankou. I specially visited him at Room 36 of the Deming Hotel in the French Concession. The following is a record of Mr. Liu's conversation: (Question) I heard that you and Director Zhu Jingnong came to Hankou from Changsha on official business. I came to inquire about the truth of Hunan Province's attitude toward the Southwest. (Answer) Director Zhu and I arrived in Hubei from Changsha by car a few days ago, but Director Zhu took a plane to Nanjing that day. The Hunan authorities' position on the situation remains the same as in the past. They insist that foreign affairs work must be done under the guidance of the overall national policy. Therefore, while they sympathize with resisting the enemy and saving the country, they must not be used by foreign enemies to control China, which is passive. (Question) It is rumored that you have an important mission this time to Hubei, and since you live in Hunan, you must have a plan in mind. I would like to know its main points. (Answer) When Guangdong and Guangxi first mobilized their troops, I had a discussion with Chairman He Yunqiao and immediately decided on a policy, believing that all provinces in the country should take the same action under the guidance of the overall national policy and not participate in civil wars. The next day, I conveyed this intention to all parties and published this view in various Hunan newspapers. As for this trip to Hubei, there is no special mission. (Question) I heard that you went to the Pacification Commissioner's Office stationed in Hubei, is that true? (Answer) Director He Xuezhu is an old acquaintance. A few days ago, I visited Director He at my convenience and exchanged views on the current situation. We shared the same opinion that the central government and the Southwest should do their best to resolve the national crisis peacefully, and it is especially important to recognize the difference between temporary anger and the overall national plan. (Question) Then, what will Hunan Province do to support the central government? (Answer) Hunan Province strives for the unity of the whole country and the revival of national culture, so as to create a solid central government with national consciousness, without mixing in the use of foreign forces to drive away the tiger from the front door and lead the wolf in from the back door. (Question) Does Tingzhou also have individual opinions to contribute to the central government? (Answer) Since Mr. He Yunqiao took charge of military and civilian affairs in Hunan Province, he has worked hard to propose to the central and local governments to treat each other with sincerity, and to seek to avoid any local struggles for power and private fights. Hunan Province is a strong shield for the central government. I hope that the central government will continue to pay attention to petty provocations in the future to avoid destroying the status quo in Hunan Province. (Question) According to your observation, this change is really due to Hunan Province's first advocacy of peace, and the central government and other provinces are all taking the overall national situation as a prerequisite to engage in peace movements. This is really a proof of the progress of Chinese people's wisdom in recent years. In the end, the whole country will inevitably return to unity. Bad soldiers are ominous, and everything will end with the overall national situation and what everyone wants. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Guangdong Province Decides to Divide into Six Zones for Air Defense Deployment <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Air defense bonds to be issued on a regular basis</p>
<p>The Provincial Bank will advance funds to proceed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong authorities have spared no effort in carrying out air defense deployment in recent years. Recently, in order to complete the provincial air defense plan as soon as possible, it was decided to implement the resolution of the Provincial Assembly to issue 10 million yuan of provincial people's air defense bonds. The issuance regulations have been drafted, and the first issuance period was originally scheduled to begin on the first day of this month. Later, due to the preparations not being complete, it was changed to the twentieth day of this month to officially issue. It is reported that after the issuance of the people's air defense bonds was decided, the provincial government, in order to ensure smooth progress and to show great impartiality, handed over the issuance work to the Provincial Assembly and asked them to prepare everything immediately so that they could be issued as scheduled. After the Provincial Assembly drafted the issuance regulations for the air defense bonds, it also actively carried out preparations, and now it is basically ready. However, in order to avoid difficulties and achieve twice the result with half the effort, it still sent the issuance work to the Department of Finance for handling and asked the department to order all county governments in the province to be responsible for assisting in the collection of bond funds to facilitate progress. The Department of Finance has agreed to follow suit and has sent personnel to take over. Recently, they are continuing to prepare and handle the unfinished procedures, and the official issuance was changed to the twentieth day of this month for this reason. The funds from these air defense bonds are designated for expanding air defense throughout the province, such as air defense equipment, construction of airfields, purchase of aircraft machinery, and all supplies. At present, the authorities have also decided to divide the entire province into East, South, West, North, Central, and Cliff six zones in the future to make a whole strict air defense deployment. After the bonds are officially issued, the Provincial Bank will first advance 5 million yuan to start implementation. When the second phase is issued, the bank will be asked to advance another 5 million yuan. The borrowed funds will be mortgaged with these 10 million yuan of air defense bonds, and they will be repaid in full after collection in the future.</p>

<p>(Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>17th: From Gucheng to Xiangyang</p>
<p>Returning to Gucheng from Shihua Street to wait for a car to return to Hekou and then to Xiangyang, it happened that the 40th Army was being transferred here. Armed comrades were constantly on the road, marching arduously, which was commendable. After waiting for a long time, a car arrived, fully loaded with sick soldiers from the army. Fortunately, I managed to squeeze on, but was eventually squeezed off. Between getting on and off, another topless car arrived, so I was able to climb on and travel again and again. The destination, Laohekou, was already in sight. The car stopped to cross the Xiang River. The 40th Army troops were gathering on the river beach, with a very neat military appearance. Entering the city was subject to strict inspection, which was very different from the situation when passing through here a few days ago. I was just unpacking at the inn when the army arrived and stationed in various rooms. The brigade commander was also stationed here. I called the waiter to prepare food, but the guards forbade me to speak because the officers were holding a meeting. I was not allowed to go downstairs either, so the freedom to eat, drink, and go to the toilet was deprived. Trapped in the encirclement, there was no rescue for a long time. I bravely went out to visit the brigade commander, but although I did not get to see him, I was fortunately allowed to go downstairs, but I was stopped again and not allowed to go up. I watched local officials and gentry coming and going. It was not until 12 o'clock in the evening that I was reported by the waiter and allowed to enter. Half of this day was spent in prison life and half in exile, all thanks to the army's transfer. Thinking of the four regiments with swords and halberds like a forest, I could not sleep all night.</p>
<p>I got up at dawn the next day and went straight to the station, as if escaping from a great disaster. On the way, I met a Mr. Someone I knew before, and only then did I know that a major incident almost happened here the day before. It turned out that the troops of the 40th Army were camping outside the city the night before. Soldiers from the Anti-Smoking Inspectorate's Anti-Smuggling Battalion went out of the city to inspect and, for some reason, a misunderstanding occurred, leading to a conflict. Several shots were fired, and one of the army's sentries was injured. Yesterday, the brigade commander came here, and the Guanghua County Government, the Hekou Chamber of Commerce, and Wu Tuanzhang of the 82nd Division and others tried their best to mediate and agreed on conditions, responsible for the injured, and if there were any accidents, they would be given considerable compensation, so the matter was settled. I asked where this money came from, and the answer was that it was borne by the local government. When a misunderstanding occurs in the military, both sides usually win. This is not the case today.</p>
<p>Traveling by car from Hekou, passing through the Taipingkou area, which was the area most severely affected by the flood last year, the road was surrounded by endless plains, all of which were fields covered with pressure, reaching tens of thousands of acres. Villages were completely shattered, and the scars could still be seen. When the flood first arrived, people climbed to the tops of trees to survive for three or four hundred, but without boats to rescue them, they could not withstand the hunger, cold, wind, and rain, and eventually fell into the flood and were buried in the belly of fish. In Taipingkou alone, thousands of farmers were drowned. The lives of our people are worthless, which is lamentable. Approaching Fancheng, heavy rain suddenly fell. The car I was riding in was open and there was nowhere to escape. My clothes were soaked. Pedestrians and travelers riding donkeys on the road were also in the wind and rain, driving and galloping, looking at each other as if they understood each other. Before long, the rain stopped and the car arrived at the station. Crossing the Han River to Xiangyang, it is customary to get out of the car when entering the city and pay respect to the soldiers guarding the city, with the feeling of "civil and military officials dismounting here." The soldiers seemed to be from the security regiment. It is said that if you don't get out of the car, the person sitting in the car will be insulted and the person pulling the car will be beaten severely. However, when paying respect to the soldiers, they sit on stools with their legs spread apart, their heroic demeanor awe-inspiring, and their arrogant attitude overflowing from their eyebrows. Although this is a small matter, it is very touching.</p>
<p>Xiangyang was formerly Xiangguo, located in the upper reaches of Jingchu, a hub between the north and the south, its danger is sufficient to consolidate, and its soil is sufficient for food. The Qing scholar Gu Zuyu said, "The situation in Huguang, in terms of the southeast, is important in Wuchang, in terms of Huguang, is important in Jingzhou, and in terms of the world, is important in Xiangyang." Although the situation has changed today, it still does not lose its important position. The county seat is located on the sunny side of the Han River, facing Fancheng, which has always been known for its commercial prosperity, across the river. Fancheng is an economic zone, while Xiangcheng is a military, political, and cultural zone, just like the confrontation in Wuhan. The Fifth District Commissioner's Office and the Second Branch of the High Court are located in the city, and there are countless other agencies and groups.</p>
<p>The number of schools is the highest in northern Hubei. In Xiangyang, there are Provincial Xiangyang High School, Provincial Junior High School, Provincial Rural Normal School, Provincial Elementary School, County Elementary School, and Hubei Northern Library and County People's Education Hall. In Fancheng, there are Private Xianbei High School, Shangzhi Elementary School, County Fancheng Elementary School, and Provincial Xiangyang People's Education Hall. Generally speaking, they are well managed, especially the Provincial High School and People's Education Hall. A student unrest occurred in the Provincial Junior High School the day before yesterday. The principal was beaten and left the school. The students went to the county party headquarters and the commissioner's office to petition, stating the principal's crimes and weeping. After the secretary of the commissioner's office persuaded them earnestly, they returned to school. For a time, there was a joke about "the principal bleeding, the students crying, and the secretary sweating." In addition, there are people's schools run by the county party headquarters and the Hubei Northern Zhongshan Daily, which can all work hard to promote culture, but due to the closed atmosphere and low level of people's intelligence, the effect is still small. The county was originally an area where humanities gathered, but now it is very different from the past, which is unexpected. When the reporter first arrived in Fancheng from Zaoyang, the car crossed a river and saw two fisherwomen scolding each other from different boats, spreading ugly voices everywhere for a long time, leaving a deep impression. After arriving in Fancheng, I got lost while visiting friends. I asked the citizens, who pointed me in random directions, and the police officers were the same, making me unable to adapt. I heard a friend say that they are slow-witted, not deliberately cunning. He gave an example, saying that when cars drive on the road, the villagers never avoid them. Even if the car honks its horn urgently, they still turn a deaf ear. Although the car can hurt people, they have not considered this at all. Later, what I saw on the road was indeed as he said. There are many prostitutes in Xiangyang City. It is not uncommon to see women laughing and playing in the streets. Last night, the commissioner's office checked residential buildings due to the alarm of an emergency in the territory and captured more than thirty pairs of illicit couples. It is not only that the people's intelligence is closed, but also that the atmosphere is deteriorating.</p>
<p>Scenic spots include Longzhong, Xianshou Xijia Pond, Lument Temple, Mi Gong Temple, Wang Can Building, Zhaoming Building, Zhang Jianzhi Temple, Du Gongbu Tomb, Wang Shuhe Tomb, etc. Only a fragment of stone remains of the Wang Building. The authenticity of the Du Tomb cannot be determined. There are many inscriptions in the Mi Temple, and his grandson is poor and addicted to smoking, selling rubbings to make a living. Longzhong is thirty miles west of the city, surrounded by mountains and forests, with Sangu Hall, Danbo Pavilion, Caolu Pavilion, Liangfu Rock, Yeyun Nunnery, Banyue Stream, Xiaohong Bridge, Genggengtian, Lotus Pond, Laolong Cave, Longwochu, and Eight-Corner Well. The drum pavilions of the Copper Drum Pavilion and other attractions are Xianshou is the first of Xianshan, four or five miles south of the city. A pavilion is built on it, and at the foot of the mountain is the Yang Du Temple, and the Dropping Tears Stele is in the temple. Xijia Pond is the residence of Xi Jian in the Jin Dynasty, with the beauty of pavilions, terraces, flowers, and trees. When Shan Jian was stationed in Xiangyang, he often got drunk here. There is spring water in the area, which is extremely clear and can irrigate the fields, so Xi Jian's reputation has become more prominent with his teeth. Lument Temple is in Fancheng, the hometown of Haoran, and is a must-see for tourists. Zhuge Gong's feather fan and turban, Yang Taichuan's light fur belt, Yan Wei's historical pen, and Meng Hao's poetic talent, the remaining charm of the flowing style, are magnificent between the Jiang and Han rivers. Now visiting its ruins is enough to evoke a sense of exploring the ancients, but there are Taoists in charge of all places, and with their vulgar customs, it is inevitable to spoil the scenery a little.

<p>Major Robbery in Huangqiao Town</p>
<p>In Huangqiao Town, Songjiang, at about 1:00 AM on the 14th, more than a dozen robbers speaking local dialects suddenly arrived, holding fast guns, box cannons, flashlights, etc. Robbers with guns were stationed at each important intersection to keep watch. At the same time, they began to rob. As a result, the victims were Qing Xiasongzhai Fresh Meat Store, Tiandetang Pharmacy, Wu Zhengda Nanhuo Shop Fresh Meat Store, Chen Yuchang North and South Goods Store, Xu Songshou Pharmacy, and a beach boat belonging to Tang Yixiu was robbed, loaded with stolen goods and escaped towards Xietang. During the robbery, A Kuan, a helper at a certain teahouse, heard the noise and came out to see what was happening. He was injured in several places by the robbers with their gun butts. The principals are now checking the lost items to report the robbery.</p>
<p>Public Burial of Poet Zhu Yuanchu</p>
<p>The poet Zhu Yuanchu from Yun Jian was a diligent student in his youth. His poems and novels were published in various newspapers in Shanghai and were widely circulated for a time. He passed away in the tenth year of the Republic of China. In the same year, his wife, Ms. Xu Xian, committed suicide due to sorrow and family poverty, leaving behind a son and a daughter. The coffin was placed in a temple for sixteen years. Now, his close friends Yao Yuanchu and Li Zihan and others have raised funds to plan his burial. A public burial was held on the 14th in Yun Jian Cemetery. The ceremony was very grand, and Cai Zhongyu was recommended by all walks of life to preside over the sacrifice, and Ping Jinya, Li Zihan, Shen Shoukuang, and Tang Tiaojun assisted in the sacrifice. Then, relatives and friends helped the coffin to ascend to the tomb, and the funeral was completed. The local Rongbao newspaper specially published a special issue to accompany it. It is heard that Mr. Li and others are also properly planning for the orphans to help them become self-reliant, so as to comfort the deceased.</p>

<p>Construction in the 25th Year</p>
<p>The County Construction Bureau, at the beginning of the year, has specially included various important construction projects in the construction plan outline for the 25th year, and decided to hold a construction committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 18th of this month to discuss various central tasks. At that time, the construction plan outline will be submitted for discussion and approval for implementation. In terms of water conservancy, it is planned to complete ten rivers this year, including Qintangjing, Luqu Bridge West River, Zhihu Bridge, Da Hong Bridge River, Heng River, Zhang Maoshe River, Wan Tang Bin, Yongxing River, South Zoumatang, and Yangshuyuan River, with an estimated cost of 8,540 yuan. The houses of the Shao and Gao families covered by the Liangxi River near Ximen and the riverside base will also be demolished to widen the river surface and allow the water source to flow smoothly, with an estimated cost of 3,318 yuan. In terms of building roads, the bridges, culverts, and road surface on the northern line of Hushan Road will be built to facilitate traffic around Wuli Lake and enhance the scenery of Hushan, with a total cost of 55,520 yuan. The Deyuan Road from Ximen Dexin Bridge to Kaiyuan Road has been filled with earthworks by labor service. The bridges, culverts, and road surface will then be completed, with an estimated cost of more than 13,400 yuan. The unrenovated section of Yangxi Road will also be renovated again so that the entire reconstruction can be completed, costing 1,114 yuan.</p>
<p>Resolution of Coarse Salt License</p>
<p>The sales of coarse salt in this county are limited, and a salt license is required to operate. Now the Salt Transport Deputy Envoy is sorting out the coarse salt licenses of various provinces and cities, and each license is stipulated to be 35 yuan. After obtaining the license, the sale of coarse salt can be operated. However, the license fee for refined salt is stipulated by the Ministry of Finance to be one yuan, so those who sell coarse salt believe that the burden is too heavy. They specially submitted a request to the Salt Transport Deputy Envoy to reduce the fee to be the same as that for refined salt. The Yangong Inn in this county received an approved instruction on the 13th, notifying the Liquor Hotel Industry Association to inform all members to go to the inn to receive the previously paid license fees.</p>
<p>Strike in Shierwei</p>
<p>More than 300 people, including representatives of the sail transport owners and salt boat workers of Shierwei and directors of the Yanpu Labor Union, came to Yangzhou to petition. After four days, the matter has not been resolved. Because the representatives petitioning in Yangzhou have not returned to the wei and there is no satisfactory news, all the laborers in Shierwei held a meeting at the Yanpu Labor Union on the 12th to plan to come to Yangzhou to participate in the petition. The person in charge of the Labor Union then returned to stop them, resulting in a conflict and the destruction of the Labor Union. The stores in Weishi also went on strike to express their support. It is heard that the salt workers had first petitioned the Yizheng County Government on the 13th, requesting the issuance of passports to come to Yangzhou to participate in the petition. The representatives of the shipping owners in Yangzhou heard the news and are now submitting it to the Salt Affairs Inspection Office and the Jiangdu County Party and government organs, requesting prompt relief to avoid expanding the situation.</p>
<p>Submitting to the Province to Explain the Housing Donation Rate</p>
<p>Jiangdu County Government, because it was ordered to collect housing donations, local people repeatedly submitted requests to the Provincial Department for exemption. However, the relevant notice was not approved. Now, the donation rate for self-produced shops and houses is based on one-thousandth of the property value of 1,000 yuan and 0.8 as the standard. Should those with a property value of less than 1,000 yuan be charged, and the regulations have no clear written regulations? On the 12th, the county government specially submitted a request to the Provincial Department for explanation.</p>

<p>Obstructing Injections Leads to Eye Gouging</p>
<p>Jin Rongsheng in Datuan Town, Eighth District, makes a living by privately selling morphine for people to inject. His nephew Baosheng repeatedly persuaded him not to listen. A few days ago, Shao Miaosheng, Jin Zugen, and Wu Qinsheng went to Rongsheng's house to inject morphine. Baosheng took the needles down and stopped them from injecting, which led to a grudge. Shao, Jin, and Wu dragged Baosheng out of the house at 11:00 PM on the 11th and used a small sharp knife to gouge out both of his eyes, rendering him disabled. Yesterday, Baosheng reported to the Second Substation of the town's Public Security Bureau, requesting detention and investigation. After the substation verified that it was true, it ordered the police to arrest the murderers and sent Baosheng to the county for examination of injuries.</p>

<p>Department of Finance Recovers Old Taxes</p>
<p>The Department of Finance, in view of the fact that the arrears of taxes in various counties over the years are very large, stipulated last year that they should be paid in three installments. The first two installments have long been overdue. Although many counties have reported their payments, they are still far from the original arrears. Now that the deadline for the third installment is the end of June, the Department has specially ordered all counties to strictly pursue and report payments within the time limit. The county government received the Department's order on the 12th to strictly pursue the matter.</p>

<p>Violating the Law and Resisting the Use of New Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Sha Pengnian, the owner of the Sha Wanlong grain store in Nancheng outside the First District of this county (that is, Nancha Township), did not comply with the regulations on the use of new weights and measures, and still privately used the old weights and measures. After the inspectors found out, they reported to the county government, which ordered the public security section to send police to stop it. However, Sha resisted with strength and wickedness, and his neighbor Wang Mouru, who was in the same industry, helped him from the sidelines. The county government immediately sent many police officers to detain the owners of the Sha and Wang stores for interrogation. After the matter was proven, in addition to exempting them from the charge of obstructing official duties, they were punished for violating the law and resisting the use of new equipment, and each was fined seven yuan to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Stagnation of Fritillary Cooperative</p>
<p>The Jinjiang Fritillary Cooperative has been plagued by internal disputes last year, and the cooperative affairs cannot proceed. In particular, the 　fritillary, which has already collected a fixed amount of money, cannot be received at full price, nor can the goods be sold. It is difficult to advance or retreat. At that time, Wang Shihe returned to his hometown on leave, and the members begged Wang to hold the method, and Wu Jing reluctantly agreed to come out and maintain it. The plan of operation has already 　has a clue. Recently, Wang realized that there are many internal disputes, and the 　is very deep. It is difficult to complete the rectification without giving full effort and sufficient time. It happened that he was ordered to cancel his leave, and he immediately resigned from the cooperative affairs. Therefore, the cooperative affairs fell into stagnation again. The loan from the Zhejiang Local Bank is now due, but no one is responsible in the cooperative, and the price of fritillary has plummeted. It is heard that it is planned to auction off more than a hundred jin of fritillary under mortgage to pay off the debt.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Housing Problems in Peiping <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Construction and Facilities</p>
<p>From the early Yuan Dynasty until the 16th year of the Republic of China, Peiping had always been the capital of our country. During this period, the nation's financial resources were concentrated here, and the city was managed and developed for six to seven hundred years. Today's grand scale is the result of the long-term efforts of our ancestors, which was no easy task. The architecture here tends towards bungalows; old-style multi-story buildings are rare, and Western-style buildings are mostly only two or three stories. Only hotel-style buildings like the Beijing Hotel and school-style buildings like the Red Building of Peking University have four or more stories. However, because they are all bungalows, they also occupy a lot of land. Currently, land is scarce in the entire city of Peiping, but one sees houses standing close together, with corners touching, all of which are dwellings. This kind of dense situation is the opposite of the city-and-forest, abundant land situation of Nanjing. Therefore, Nanjing, with a population of just under one million, already feels crowded, while this place, with a population of more than one and a half million, still feels spacious. The palace-style red walls, yellow tiles, upturned eaves, and flying corners of the architecture here have long been famous throughout the world as representatives of Eastern architectural art. Even ordinary buildings are mostly gray tiles and blue bricks, and the houses are all regularly square, both dignified and orderly. The two large doors are mostly painted red; green or black paint is also occasionally used. Copper or iron rings are installed on the doors for those who knock. Usually, electric bells are also installed above the door lintel, with both old and new side by side. The walls are thick, all over one foot four or five inches thick, and the roofs are also as thick as three or four feet, so they can block the wind and sun, and are warm in winter and cool in summer. Regardless of large or small households, all have spacious courtyards. The side rooms and main rooms are not connected, and the toilets and kitchens are also separated from the main house. Because of the sparse rainfall, grass does not grow in the courtyard, but flowers, trees, and vines are all planted to decorate it. More spacious ones also have gardens, in which towering trees sway in the wind.</p>
<p>The windows are mostly covered with two layers of gauze and white paper. However, this layer of white paper can be raised and lowered. It is raised when there is no wind and lowered when there is wind. In summer, those facing east and west have an additional layer of bamboo blinds. Inside the house, the doors are mostly single-leaf and mostly open outwards. Those going from inside to outside push the door, while those going from outside to inside pull the door. Those who are more particular also hang curtains on the doors in winter and summer, as this place is often windy and sandy, so this is necessary. Also, because of the climate, whether rich or poor, fire stoves must be lit indoors in winter. However, the rich have tall Western-style iron stoves, while the poor have short iron stoves. As for the installation of heating pipes, it is not common in private residences except in schools, hotels, and public institutions. This is due to both economic reasons and the architectural structure.</p>
<p>Levels of Housing</p>
<p>Schools and public institutions are generally in good condition. These cannot be considered as ordinary residences. Private residences can be roughly divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. Upper-class residences are mostly equipped with red-lacquered doors, electric lights, electric bells, telephones, and running water. Upon entering the gate, there is a guard room or reception room next to the gate, and a garage is attached for parking cars or rickshaws. The houses here usually have three courtyards, and some even have more than ten. The upper rooms, lower rooms, side rooms, study rooms, toilets, kitchens, and dining rooms and public living rooms are all available. Those with gardens naturally have flowers, plants, trees, and rocks. Even those without gardens have flowerbeds and shady trees in their courtyards. The value of each such residence is at least ten thousand yuan or more. Families living in such houses must have at least one guard and one rickshaw puller. Moreover, the expenses for electricity, water, and property taxes are no less than one hundred yuan per month. Middle-class residences are also quite impressive in appearance, but their structure is slightly simpler than that of upper-class residences. For example, upon entering the gate, there is usually no guard room, but a screen is erected to shield the interior of the house. In fact, after turning past the screen, there is only one or two courtyards of houses. The courtyard is generally not very large, and it is sometimes planted with flowers and plants, or slightly decorated with potted plants such as oleanders. The total number of rooms is about ten to twenty. Electric lights are naturally available in every household, but not many have their own telephone. Usually, several families share one, or they are called by a neighbor (called "street neighbor" here) who has a telephone and pay them one or two yuan per month for the electricity. Running water is usually available. If one has their own rickshaw, it can only be parked in the gatehouse or under a wide and deep corridor. The kitchen is usually only a half-shed, which only has a roof on one side and no ridge. The toilet is not a separate room, but is attached to the wall of the house, covered with a sheet of iron, and a deep pit dug below. The living room and study room are often in the same place. Although the structure of such residences is small, they are single-family and quite discreet and peaceful. It is most suitable for small families of two. The value of each is about one thousand to ten thousand yuan. If it is rented, the monthly rent is only about ten to twenty yuan.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of lower-class residences is that they are collectively inhabited; single-family residences are rare. The most typical representative of this type of residence is the "large courtyard." A large courtyard is surrounded by dozens or even hundreds of low houses. Each household lives in one or several low houses, but it is rare to have more than five rooms. The courtyard has no flowers or grass, only a muddy ground full of ash, soil, broken bricks, uneven. Rotting vegetables, rags, coal cinder, and accumulated soil are thrown in the shadows of the walls and the corners of the houses. When people pass by, flies buzz and fly. When the scorching sun shines, the foul odor is nauseating. The window openings are very small, and there is not enough light. Several members of the family often sleep on one kang (a heated brick bed). This kang has a very large area, with both ends against the wall, and its width occupies half of the entire room. Usually, cooking stoves are placed outside the door. When it rains, the stove is moved inside. At this time, although the factory doors are ventilated, it is unbearably hot. When it is hot, the courtyard is full of low tables, short stools, and broken mats. Men and women, old and young, sit and lie bare-chested among them. Sweat permeates the air, smelling like sour porridge. The people living in these large courtyards are mostly rickshaw puller families. There are 80,000 rickshaw pullers here, so large courtyards are everywhere. The monthly rent for each household is only a few dimes or one or two yuan.</p>
<p>Temporary Public Residences</p>
<p>Temporary public residences in Peiping can be roughly divided into five types: hotels, inns, hostels, apartments, and "chicken feather shops."</p>
<p>Hotels are mostly Western-style, with all modern facilities. Western food is available, and music can be listened to. Moreover, hotels such as the Beijing Hotel also have dance halls. Those who stay in these hotels are mostly wealthy officials or wealthy merchants. The daily room rate is at least two yuan or more. There are about eight or nine in total. The Beijing Hotel and the Six Nations Hotel are relatively luxurious. More economical ones, like the Beicheng Palace Hotel, cost only one yuan per day for the room.</p>
<p>Inns and hostels are slightly different here. The former began to flourish after the founding of the Republic of China, while the latter mostly has a history of several decades. The architecture and facilities of hostels are newer than those of inns. For example, the beds in hostels are copper beds, while those in inns are mostly wooden-framed spring beds. Moreover, hostels are mostly multi-story buildings, while inns are mostly bungalows. The management and service of hostels are also more advanced than those of inns. In terms of customers, hostels are mostly frequented by people from the academic and business sectors, while inns sometimes have customers from the countryside in addition to small merchants. Hostels are concentrated in the Xihua River area, such as the Jiaotong Hostel and the Zhengyang Hostel. Inns are concentrated in the Damochang and Luomashi areas, such as the Tianda Store and the Changfa Inn. In terms of room rates, hostels are more expensive than inns, with the former ranging from several dimes to several yuan, and the latter costing at most one yuan or more.</p>
<p>The number of apartments in Peiping is comparable to that of hotels, and they can be described as "standing in rows." This is because there are many schools here, but not many have dormitories. On the other hand, there are many vacant houses available for rent. The custom of Peiping people making a living by renting out rooms has a long history. To meet the needs of society, renting out their houses has become a trend. The houses and facilities of apartments are equivalent to middle-class residences. Most of the residents are students. The monthly rent for a room is about three to five yuan. If meals are included, it costs about twelve to fifteen yuan.</p>
<p>"Chicken feather shops" are temporary lodgings for beggars, vagrants, street performers, and petty thieves. It only costs five or six coppers per person per night (about three large copper coins). These chicken feather shops are mostly located in the Tianqiao area. The shops are covered with piles of chicken feathers, on which the lodgers can sleep at will. The suffering here is like one being in heaven and the other in hell, compared to those living in Western-style buildings with spring beds and silk quilts.</p>

<p>City News: President Jiang Replies to Major Universities in the City</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Fourteen university presidents in this city, including Weng Zhilong, concerned about the mobilization of Guangdong-Guangxi troops invading Hunan, sent a telegram to the Guangdong-Guangxi authorities on the 11th, urging them to pull back, and telegraphed the central government, asking for sincerity to eliminate the hidden divisions in the nation. After receiving the telegram, President Jiang replied on the 13th. The original telegram is transcribed as follows: "President Weng of Tongji University, and conveyed to Li, Chu, Zhang, Yan, Xiao, Chu, Liu, Cao, Zhang, Liu, Ou, Pei, and He. I am deeply moved by your telegram. The country is in danger, and unity is the only way to resist foreign aggression. The central government has scheduled the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee and has repeatedly telegraphed the Guangdong-Guangxi generals, ordering them to send responsible personnel to Nanjing to discuss the plan to save the nation. I hope to move them with sincerity and dispel the disaster in the invisible. Your intention is the same as mine.

<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, has been staying in Shanghai for medical treatment due to a foot ailment and has not fully recovered. Yesterday, the news of Mr. Zhang Taiyan's death arrived. Upon hearing the news, Yu was filled with grief. In addition to sending a telegram of condolence to Madam Zhang, he also sent Zeng Tongyi, a member of the Control Yuan, to Suzhou to assist with the funeral arrangements. The telegram is transcribed as follows: "Madam Zhang, Funeral Arrangements Office of Mr. Zhang Taiyan, Suzhou: I was shocked to read the news of Mr. Zhang Taiyan's death. I am filled with grief. Mr. Zhang lived in an era of national crisis, and his learning combined the strengths of Chinese scholars. He was a teacher of ethics, and his historical research built up the national spirit. I had hoped for the opening of a grand hall and the far-reaching spread of his teachings. I did not expect that his death would be a national mourning. I hope that Madam and the sons will control your grief and assist with the important matters. In deep sorrow, I do not know what to say. Yu Youren sends his condolences."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Rumor of Guangdong Freezing Legal Tender, Banking Circles Believe It Difficult to Implement <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Financial Panic and Sealing Will Be More Unfavorable</p>
<p>Exchange Rate of Shanghai-Guangdong Silver Yuan Has Not Risen</p>
<p>New News Agency reports: According to a Reuter's dispatch from Guangzhou, the Guangdong authorities are preparing to freeze banknotes in Guangzhou banks and suspend withdrawals in order to curb the sharp decline of Guangdong currency. However, according to inquiries by a reporter from the New News Agency, banking circles in this city have not received any relevant news. They only know that after the tense situation, the value of Guangdong currency has fallen, and the demand for central legal tender is high, resulting in tight credit. If it is suddenly frozen, Guangdong's finances will become more panicked. Since the currency reform, a management committee for legal tender reserves has been established in Guangzhou to handle legal tender matters, all of which are presided over by the committee. It is expected that this matter will be difficult to implement. In addition, the exchange rate of Shanghai-Guangdong silver yuan is still around 640 yuan and has not shown an upward trend. However, in order to stabilize public sentiment, in addition to legitimate commercial remittances, ordinary remittances are restricted.</p>

<p>All Those Over Sixteen Must Participate</p>
<p>Building Three Roads in the City Center</p>
<p>It is determined that the city's Boy Scouts will, starting on the 1st, hold road construction in the city center. The curriculum competition has been decided to be postponed to the second half of the year. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Curriculum Competition Postponed</p>
<p>The city's Boy Scouts' 7th Grand Review and Camporee was unable to be fully performed due to rain. There are still curriculum competitions and award ceremonies. The Board of Directors previously decided to postpone it. It was changed to be held at the Daji Road Public Stadium. Yesterday, the association held another board meeting to discuss this matter. As a result, due to the fact that all primary and secondary schools will be on vacation within the month and are currently preparing for major exams, it was decided to postpone it to the next semester.</p>
<p>Scores to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>As for the scores of each "Wei" (unit), except for the curriculum competition, which has not been held and cannot be evaluated, the remaining camping reviews, emergency exercises, etc., have been evaluated by the judging committee and will be announced soon. The board of directors has used all the donations of prize money from various parties to purchase practical items, such as clothing, military supplies, etc., as awards. The award ceremony will be replaced by the board of directors notifying each "Wei" to directly claim their awards. President Wu Tiecheng also took 10,000 photos to distribute to all the Boy Scouts in the association.</p>
<p>Three Roads to be Built Regularly</p>
<p>After the curriculum competition is postponed, the association has determined that, at 7:00 AM on the 1st (Sunday), the Boy Scouts Labor Service will be held at the Municipal Government. All Boy Scouts over the age of sixteen must participate. Those who participate will each receive a subsidy of two jiao for transportation expenses and a commemorative badge. At that time, three roads will be built behind the Municipal Government: one will be Zhi Ren Yong Road (Wisdom, Benevolence, Courage), the second will be Service Road, and the third will be Xing Shan Road (Doing Good).</p>
<p>Complete Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bonds</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreigners Enthusiastically Subscribe</p>
<p>Allocate by Proportion Due to Oversubscription</p>
<p>Zhakou Cao'e River Section to be Put Out to Tender and Construction to Commence Soon</p>
<p>After the issuance of £1.1 million of 6% British gold bonds for the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC acted as agents for the subscription. Chinese and foreigners applied very enthusiastically. It is expected that the subscription will be fully closed before the 17th. In particular, British people subscribed the most, because our country's bonds have a good reputation in the London market, and the prices have soared. Foreigners are happy to buy them. For example, the British gold bonds issued before were also subscribed through the above four banks. As a result, the subscriptions exceeded the total amount of the bonds. It was unavoidable to allocate them proportionally. Therefore, if the subscriptions for this bond exceed the total amount, the proportional allocation will be handled as before. Now that the Ministry of Railways has issued the bonds, in addition to the Qiantang River Bridge, which is under active construction, the section from Zhakou to Cao'e River of the incomplete Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been surveyed long ago and will soon be put out to tender for construction.</p>

Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>This conference is held at the People's Education Center, which has a large area and beautiful trees. On weekdays, there are many visitors, and participants will inevitably be crowded. The layout of each place has been rushed day and night, and it has been completely renovated. A simple colorful archway is built at the gate, with the words "Shanghai 15th Health Campaign Conference" written on it. Two wooden archways are built inside. Mayor Wu wrote "Protect My Well-being," and Director Li wrote "The Foundation of a Strong Nation," each with four characters.

The lecture hall is the venue for the conference. The opening ceremony and daily performances are all held here. The conference preparatory committee, fearing that the venue is relatively narrow, has installed another sound amplifier to make the sound waves reach all parts of the outdoors. In addition, temporary shops are set up in the remaining corridors and gaps to exhibit health products, and the layout is extremely compact and orderly.</p>
<p>Today's Program</p>

<p>This health exhibition includes products from the Ministry of Health, the Central Factory Inspection Office, the Health Bureau, and the Public Works Department's Health Department, etc., totaling more than 5,000 items, divided into five parts: maternal and child health, school health, factory health, disease prevention, and dental health. The listed charts, models, and specimens are extremely eye-catching.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Activities</p>

<p>Six Companies Resolve to Reduce Schedules and Suspend Ships</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign shipping merchants regard the Yangtze River route as the lifeblood of their business. Since the six companies formed an alliance last year to share the profits, water fees have been increased, rebates have been reduced, and the size and weight measurements have all been made less lenient. In addition, the Pingzhun Yanghang was commissioned to handle the measuring and weighing, etc. As a result, the cargo of guest families has been changed to be transported by private boats, trains, and parcel post. Therefore, the six companies have suffered a major blow in their business. Recently, due to various environmental reasons, the volume of cargo transportation on the Yangtze River has formed a rare sharp decline in decades. Now, there is a phenomenon of overcapacity and shared losses. For this reason, the six companies have held repeated plenary meetings to discuss remedial measures. The consensus is to reduce schedules, suspend ships, investigate the actual situation, and then determine fundamental policies. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Business Losses</p>
<p>The section from Shanghai to Hankou is called the "Yangtze River Money," and the section from Hankou to Yichang is called the "Mid-Yangtze River Money." The ships of the six companies sailing on these two routes calculate the cargo load according to the profit-sharing system. The results were good in the second half of last year. This year, from January to the present, for half a year, both inbound and outbound cargoes have declined month by month. Since the implementation of measurement, it has plummeted. Since April, there have been very few goods transported from Shanghai's main street to the Yangtze River. Comparing this year's cargo volume with the same period last year, some are 60% of what it was, and some are only half. Although there are more than one reason, the water fee income of each company has suffered too much loss.</p>
<p>Maintain Profit Sharing</p>
<p>Yu Feipeng, the acting Minister of Transportation, came to Shanghai for this matter and summoned the responsible representatives of China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and other shipping companies to discuss relief measures. At that time, he advocated improving the profit-sharing system, but after consultation, it was believed that if the alliance agreement were abolished, it would inevitably lead to an oversupply of price competition and depreciation of water fees. As a result of the consultation, the original profit-sharing system was maintained. However, the issue of leniency for measured goods was negotiated to find a compromise solution to appease guest families. At the same time, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin were informed of this intention. Therefore, the profit-sharing agreement is still maintained as usual.</p>
<p>Reduce Schedules and Suspend Ships</p>
<p>The Yangtze River liners of the six companies are 13 ships from Taikoo, 10 ships from Jardine Matheson, 7 ships each from China Merchants and Sanbei, 7 ships from Nissin, and 2 ships from Ningshao (including the Mid-Yangtze River ships, the six companies have a total of 68 ships in the profit-sharing agreement). Recently, the upstream and downstream Yangtze River ships of each company have only 30-40% of their capacity, and the freight revenue is not enough to burn coal. Therefore, the six companies held a meeting to discuss this issue last Wednesday. According to this business, it is difficult to maintain. Unless the six companies collectively reduce schedules and suspend ships, there is no way to save it. It was unanimously decided on the spot that Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, Sanbei, and Nissin, etc., each have no more than four Yangtze River schedules per week (including the Shanghai direct to Yichang ship and the direct to Xiangtan ship). According to the current number of ship schedules, at least six schedules will be reduced each week, and 24 ships must be reduced each month.</p>
<p>Not Yet Consistent</p>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Company has already taken the lead in reducing Yangtze River ships. The company used to have a direct Shanghai to Yichang liner, which was guaranteed to sail once a week. Now it has begun to suspend flights and has reassigned the Changsha ship in the Yangtze River to the Hankou Yichang schedule and will no longer come to Shanghai. In the above proposal to reduce schedules and suspend ships, the representatives of the six companies stated that the losses of the ships whose schedules are suspended and cancelled by each company will still be compensated by the profit-sharing fund to show fairness. However, Nissin Company opposed it, on the grounds that each time the company's Yangtze River ship sails, the government pays a subsidy, and the Shanghai company has no right to reduce schedules. Therefore, the six companies still need to discuss the Nissin issue.</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>The six companies believe that the sharp decline in Yangtze River business in the past two months this year, the real reason for which cannot be understood without going to the Yangtze River for a whole inspection and investigation. In order to facilitate timely discussion of remedial measures, it has been jointly discussed and decided to organize a six-company group Yangtze River Investigation Committee. It has been decided to appoint the Taikoo Taipan, the Jardine Matheson Taipan, Zeng Guangqing, the business section chief of China Merchants Bureau, Wu Delin, the deputy manager of Sanbei, and Lu Yuyang, the director of Ningshao. They will depart from Shanghai at the end of this month, and each port along the Yangtze River must be thoroughly investigated to serve as the basis for remedial measures.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Qiu Jiang Wharf to Hold Groundbreaking Ceremony Regularly <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>To be Held at 3:00 PM on the 20th</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Qiu Jiang Wharf has been under construction for a year now. Each project has a considerable scale. It is scheduled to lay the cornerstone at 3:00 PM on the 20th of this month and hold a grand groundbreaking ceremony. Invitations are sent to Chinese and foreign people from all walks of life to participate. The recent construction situation of the wharf is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wharf Traffic Construction Completed</p>
<p>The only access road to Qiu Jiang Wharf is Wuquan Road. The road section from the wharf to Jungong Road was stipulated by the municipal government long ago, but the municipal government's funds were insufficient and it has not been built. The Qiu Jiang Wharf will soon be completed. If the road section is not built, the wharf's traffic will be inconvenient. Therefore, the Central Bank cooperated with the municipal government. The Central Bank allocated 150,000 yuan for road construction at one time, half of which was used as a loan from the municipal government and half of which was borne by the Central Bank. The road project was tendered and constructed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The construction has been going on for several months and is being rushed. It will soon be completed. After the road is completed, those who go to the wharf no longer need to take a ferry from Dinghai Island. They can reach Jungong Road from Yangshupu, turn into Wuquan Road, and go directly to the wharf.</p>
<p>Set Up a Railway to Connect with the Songhu Line</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the combined transportation of water and land, the Qiu Jiang Wharf plans to lay several railway lines before and after the wharf, which will merge into one at Wuquan Road and connect to the Songhu Line along the northern part of the city center, about nine kilometers long. The Two Roads Administration has planned this railway, which requires more than 700,000 yuan. How to raise this cost is currently being discussed by the Central Trust Bureau and the Two Roads Administration. In the future, the construction of this route will greatly facilitate the transportation of passengers and goods, which is truly a characteristic of the Qiu Jiang Wharf.</p>
<p>Timber Piles Arrive Late, Affecting the Project</p>
<p>The timber piles needed for huge buildings in our country all come from overseas. The Qiu Jiang Wharf project is huge, so it is no exception. About thousands of timber piles are needed, all of which are 100 feet or 120 feet long, ordered from the United States by the contractor, Chuangxin Construction Company, and shipped to Shanghai in succession. It was originally scheduled to arrive in March of this year. Recently, there was a strike at the American timber pile company, resulting in hundreds of timber piles not being delivered. The wharf warehouse project was originally scheduled to be completed in 90 days, so it will be slightly affected. The completion date may be slightly delayed. The Qiu Jiang Wharf is our country's only large wharf. The equipment must be perfect. Various machines, such as cranes and cargo trolleys, are being purchased from various foreign merchants for installation and use at the wharf.</p>
<p>Preparing for the Groundbreaking Ceremony</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Qiu Jiang Wharf has been under construction for a year now. Each project has a considerable scale. Now the bank is scheduled to lay the cornerstone at 3:00 PM on the 20th of this month and hold a grand groundbreaking ceremony. Invitations have been sent to people from all walks of life, and hundreds of invitation cards have been sent out. The bank's President Kong Yongzhi and the Chairman of the Qiu Jiang Wharf Construction Committee, Song Ziliang, and all the committee members will all go to give speeches at that time. This groundbreaking ceremony was started by the Qiu Jiang Wharf Affairs Office of the bank a month ago. The General Affairs Section is responsible for preparing the layout of the ceremony site and the ships for picking up and dropping off guests. The reception will be handled by all senior staff of the Trust Bureau. The publicity will be handled by Zhu Shikang, the Deputy Manager of the Trust Bureau, and Xu Lisheng, the Secretary.</p>
<p>Central Bank Publishes Commemorative Album</p>
<p>The Central Bank will also publish a commemorative album and distribute it to all guests for commemoration and publicity. There are many comments from managers of major foreign shipping companies on the commemorative album, as well as an introduction by Minister Kong, the plan of Song Ziliang, chairman of the Qiu Jiang Wharf Construction Committee, to build the Qiu Jiang Wharf, and many papers by Mayor Wu and Guo, the Director of the International Trade Bureau. It can be seen that this groundbreaking ceremony of the Qiu Jiang Wharf is of great significance. Here is a copy of the program list of the groundbreaking ceremony: Chairman Song Ziliang of the Qiu Jiang Wharf Construction Committee delivers the opening speech, Minister Kong delivers the address, Mayor Wu delivers the address, the Public Security Bureau plays music, Minister Kong performs the groundbreaking ceremony, photography, tea party.</p>
<p>Special Steamer to Welcome Guests</p>
<p>Those who go to watch the ceremony that day can take a car to the bottom of Dinghai Island in the fish market and take a special steamer provided by the Central Trust Bureau to the Qiu Jiang Wharf. A detailed route map is printed on the back of the invitation card for guests to refer to in detail. Because the road from Jungong Road to the wharf is currently under construction and has not yet been completed, those who go to the Qiu Jiang Wharf can take a car directly when it is completed soon without having to take a ferry from Dinghai Island.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Dyeing and Weaving Association Submits a Petition to Control the Import of Cotton Cloth <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Strict Industrial and Commercial Organization</p>
<p>The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city, based on the resolution of the 7th Members' Congress, submitted a petition to the government to control the import of cotton cloth and strictly organize the association. Letters were submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for handling. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The petition is for the matter of petitioning to control the import of cotton cloth. It is believed that the scourge of smuggling is enough to endanger the foundation of the country. Only in special areas, under the trampling of foreign forces, efforts are made to prevent it, but it cannot be achieved in the end. The members of the association are based on the sincerity of saving the country and themselves, and they are all anxious day and night. Therefore, they believe that controlling trade is a targeted medicine to prevent smuggling. Cotton cloth is an item that our country already has a large amount of production and has reliable statistics, so it is possible to implement it first. Therefore, it was proposed and resolved by the 7th Members' Congress to petition the government to establish a cotton cloth import control agency, which will approve import credentials for the number of items that our country produces the least, and then import them from foreign countries for merchants to sell. Since imports are restricted, smuggling is easy to prevent. The matter is hereby presented to your ministry for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>It is found that the current laws and regulations of the Industry Association lack detailed regulations on the sanctions against non-member colleagues, so that the organizations of each industry association are loose and cannot exert a powerful function. At this moment, the government has entrusted the Industry Association with the power to report smuggling and assist in investigation. It is deeply felt that the responsibility is heavy, and it is necessary to petition the government to amend the laws and regulations of the Industry Association as soon as possible, so as to strictly organize the organization. When the 7th Members' Congress of our association discussed this case, all members agreed that it was specially based on the case and sent to your association for investigation, and begged to be allowed to forward it to the government's competent authorities for speedy amendment of the laws and regulations of the Industry Association, and to include the articles that force colleagues to join the association.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee: Silk Cocoon Testing Completed, Cocoon Released <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Do Not Conform Must Pay a Deposit; Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing, Silk Factories Start Work One After Another</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee detained those who bought cocoons at prices below the standard price from silk merchants and remnant cocoon merchants. Now the spinning and conversion test has been completed, and the detained cocoons have been completely released. The silk factories have started work one after another. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Spinning and Conversion Test Completed, Detained Cocoon Released</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee to quickly release the detained spring cocoons, the control committee immediately sampled and tested the spinning and conversion, which has now been completed. This year, the quality of ten kinds of cocoons in Haining Chongde and other places is inferior to last year, with about 600 catties of fresh cocoons per market dan of silk, while the original standard was 550 catties of fresh cocoons per dan of silk. Therefore, the detained cocoons have been completely released. However, those whose spinning and conversion are the same as the original standard, but the purchase price is below the standard number, will also be released, but a deposit must be paid, about one yuan per dan, depending on the level of the purchase price, and then the punishment method will be determined.</p>
<p>Collect Improvement Fee of 6 Jiao Per Dan</p>
<p>The control committee collects a silkworm improvement fee, which is set at 6 jiao of national currency per dan of dried cocoons. 290 catties of fresh cocoons are combined into one dan of dried cocoons. When the cocoon merchants who collect the cocoons dry and ship them, they must be verified by the control committee, and the reported number of cocoons collected must be consistent. For example, if 290 dan of fresh cocoons are collected, 100 dan of dried cocoons should be baked according to the regulations. If the baking and conversion are slightly tender, those who bake 100 dan of dried cocoons must make up for the improvement fee of 10 dan of dried cocoons.</p>
<p>Cocoon Shops Stop Weighing, Silk Factories Start Work</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Control Committee cracked down on cocoon merchants raising and lowering cocoon prices, silk factories and remnant cocoon merchants have purchased at standard prices, that is, 21 yuan for native cocoons and 30 yuan for improved cocoons. Now, the cocoon shops that buy native cocoons in Zhejiang have stopped weighing one after another. The cocoon shops that buy improved cocoons and the cocoon shops that buy improved cocoons in Jiangsu will also stop weighing. The quality of cocoons is better than that of Zhejiang Province, and the silk factories in Wuxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and other places have started spinning silk one after another. As far as Shanghai is concerned, there are more than 20 companies in total, such as Hengcang.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Minfeng Paper Mill Hosts Visitors from All Sectors in Jiaxing <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The entire plant's engineering equipment is extremely grand and precise. The factory also holds its sixth shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Huashang Minfeng Paper Company held its sixth shareholders' meeting in Jiaxing yesterday and invited people from all walks of life to visit the factory's facilities in Jiaxing, as well as to tour South Lake, returning in the evening. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Many people from all walks of life were invited yesterday, including prominent figures from industry, commerce, journalism, and representatives from government agencies. Those who attended included Xu Fu, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau; Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau; Chu Huiseng, President of Shanghai Law School; Jin Runxiang and Yan E’sheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Huang Yanfang, Executive Director of the Shanghai Fish Market; Lao Jingxiu from Nanyang Company; Sun Meitang from the Ningbo Native Place Association; Xu Maotang from Zhonghui Bank; Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Yan Duh He from the Xinwen Bao; and reporters from various news agencies. The company’s entire board of directors, including Yu Zuoting, Jin Tingsun, Xie Heng, Zhang Jiguang, General Manager Zhu Meixian, and all employees, totaling over 500 people, were warmly received by General Manager Zhu and other staff.</p>
<p>Arrival in Jiaxing: Participants arrived at the North Station before 8:35 AM yesterday, boarding a special train chartered by the company. The train departed at 8:35 AM and arrived at 10:40 AM with few stops along the way. Attendees then proceeded to the company's conference hall and rested on the lawn. When the train arrived at the station, company personnel were already there to greet them, and students from Minfeng Elementary School welcomed them on-site. Welcome flags and posters were displayed along the route, providing a very thoughtful reception.</p>
<p>Welcome Arrangement: The company's planned welcome arrangement for guests and shareholders was as follows: Guests and shareholders gather in the garden; Raise the national and factory flags, with cannon salutes; Elementary school students sing a welcome song; Photography; Opening of the welcome meeting; Tour; Guests tour South Lake; Shareholders' Meeting.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech: Chairman Xu Fu gave a welcome speech to the guests, saying: Today is the day of the sixth shareholders' meeting of the Minfeng Paper Mill. We are extremely pleased and honored to have so many distinguished guests from all walks of life in attendance. In recent years, due to my heavy involvement in government affairs, General Manager Zhu Meixian has been primarily responsible for the factory's affairs, for which I feel greatly indebted. The factory has been in operation for seven years, and its management and operation have been excellent. During these seven years, the entire society has been in a state of economic recession, with factories and industrial organizations closing down and failing one after another. However, our factory has been able to continue to move forward as usual, which is truly due to the efforts of the assistant managers. I still remember that President Chiang Kai-shek stated in his New Year's Day broadcast speech this year that productive construction is an essential plan for saving the country. We can increase production by establishing factories, solve the livelihood of many people, block leaks, and increase tax revenue, which is of no small benefit to the country and society. If all factories in the country could develop like our factory, then we would surely become strong. Today, those present are well-known figures from industry, commerce, and journalism. I hope that the journalistic community will promote and guide us, and that the financial and commercial communities will provide support and assistance so that our factory can progress day by day.</p>
<p>Establishment Process: After Mr. Xu's speech, General Manager Zhu Meixian proceeded to report on the establishment process of the factory, saying: Our factory was founded in 1930. In 1930, there were six paper mills in the country, one of which was named Hefeng. All six factories have since failed, due to their inability to compete with a certain national organized factory. Each factory had an annual production of over 3,000 tons, while China only needed 2,000 tons, which led to price wars. For example, the original selling price of kraft paper was 80 taels of silver per ton, but it fell to 20 taels. Our factory then purchased the Hefeng factory, which caused great pain at the time. We then tried to improve and unite with other factories in the same industry to establish a joint business office to reduce unnecessary competition. However, there is still one paper mill that has not joined, which is still a drawback. After that, prices gradually recovered, but production was still high, and the surplus was all kraft paper, while the paper needed for other purposes was still not produced and was all imported. For example, the stiff paper inside cigarette tubes has annual sales of 10,000 to 20,000 tons, and the jacquard paper boards used for printing in silk weaving factories, as well as other papers, are all foreign goods. Therefore, our factory is unwilling to produce kraft paper with other factories in the same industry, and the Hangzhou Huafeng factory, a sister factory, has also stopped production at the same time. In this way, only four factories are producing kraft paper, and supply and demand may be equal. Our factory, on the other hand, specializes in the production of jacquard paper and paper used for cigarettes, especially with a large amount purchased by the domestic Nanyang Tobacco Company. Last year, our factory reallocated 750,000 in capital to produce cigarette paper (i.e., the paper outside the cigarette). Although it has not yet reached a state of complete success, it is already applicable. The Nanyang Tobacco Company and four or five other Chinese tobacco factories have already placed orders. We hope for assistance from all parties in the future.</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives: Subsequently, shareholder representative Chu Huiseng gave a speech, saying: I am a representative of the shareholders of both the current Minfeng and the former Hefeng factory. When Hefeng was founded in 1925, there was only one paper mill in the country, so supply and demand were in line, and it was possible to profit. Later, many others followed, and with the dumping of Japanese goods, as well as the Qi-Lu War, Hefeng completely failed and went bankrupt. Fortunately, at this time, we were able to have Mr. Mei and other new shareholders continue to operate. Although Hefeng is now a thing of the past, the factory's foundation still exists. The development of a business depends on its own efforts, but it also depends on the support and assistance of all sectors. However, the development of domestic goods also depends on tariff protection, so that foreign kraft paper can also disappear. Currently, due to smuggling, smuggled paper can enter without tax, which is a crisis for our factory and other factories in the same industry. I hope that all guests will work with our factory to resist smuggled goods, which would not only be fortunate for our factory, but also for all domestic goods factories. After Mr. Chu's speech, Mr. Yan Duh He, a reporter from the Xinwen Bao, gave a speech, saying that in the past, there were two reasons for the failure of domestic goods: after losses, there were no successors to continue the struggle; domestic goods manufacturers would attack and envy each other. The Minfeng factory was able to actively operate after the failure of its predecessor and propose to form a joint venture with various factories. This is how it can consolidate its commercial war front and succeed. It is not a fluke. Today, it has invented domestic cigarette paper, allowing us to smoke pure domestic cigarettes, and its spirit is truly admirable. Subsequently, Mr. Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Mr. Ling Ruigong, a representative of the Zhejiang Construction Department, delivered congratulatory speeches (details omitted). After the speeches, lunch was held in the hall. After the meal, the guests were accompanied by the factory's staff to visit the entire plant and to tour South Lake. The shareholders' meeting was held in the evening.</p>
<p>Engineering Overview: The Minfeng Paper Mill is located near the East Railway Station in Jiaxing, at the former site of the Hefeng Paper Mill. It was founded in 1930 with a capital of 1.25 million. The chairman is Xu Fu, and the general manager is Zhu Meixian, assisted by Jin Runxiang. The factory covers an estimated area of over 100 acres and is a large-scale paper mill in the country. Its main projects are as follows: Steel Rolling Workshop: The raw materials for the cigarette paper produced by the factory are waste hemp and broken fishing nets. Therefore, a steel rolling workshop is set up to roll the fishing nets into small pieces, which can then be used to extract fiber. Ash Removal Workshop: The raw materials such as hemp cloth are cleaned of ash and soil. Material Selection Workshop: The raw materials are selected and cut into small pieces to prepare for pulping. The female workers in the workshop wear gas masks to prevent impurities from entering their mouths. When reporters visited, they saw that the female workers were practicing military exercises. Pulping Workshop: After the raw materials are sorted, they are sent to the pulping workshop. The workshop is equipped with various pulping machines, which are used to grind the materials into a liquid pulp. The initial pulp is not clean. After refining by several machines, it becomes a pure white pulp. Paper Making Room: The clean pulp is added to the machine, rolled. Before long, a clean, white sheet of paper is made, which is rolled out by the machine. At this point, the papermaking process is complete. The strength of the paper is tested by machine to determine its quality. In addition to the engineering facilities, the factory also has a school for the children of workers (Minfeng Elementary School) and a after-hours school for supplementary education. It can be called a prototype of a model factory in our country.</p>

<p>None of the three people in the car were injured. Zhu Sichun was injured and sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Fan Shaoceng, former commander of the First Division of the Sichuan Army of the Twenty-First Army, has resided in Shanghai for a long time and owns a private car. The registration number is 33 in both the Chinese and International Concessions. Yesterday, a friend of Fan surnamed Wang borrowed the car from Fan and went to the Zhapu seaside for fun with three friends and a bodyguard. On the way back, it was already half past four in the afternoon. When driving through Beiqiao in Shanghai County, another car was driving slowly in front. Fan's chauffeur, impatient for a moment, accelerated to overtake the car. Accidentally, Fan's car plunged into the creek, and the car overturned. None of the three people in the car were injured. However, Zhu Sichun (56 years old), a farmer living in Sanbao, Jingtuxiang, Shanghai County, happened to be passing by and was injured in the head and waist. The branch of the County Public Security Bureau heard the news and sent police to the scene. First, the injured person was sent to Beiqiao Hospital for dressing, and then transferred to Shanghai Hospital. The car was then recovered from the creek and sent to Shanghai for repairs.</p>

<p>Zhang injured in three places on his hands and feet. Two neighboring girls may be disabled.</p>
<p>Velvet merchant Feng Zhijie resides at No. 6 Shouxiang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, Minguo Road. Feng joined the Sixth Team of the South Shanghai Defense Corps as a volunteer member last year. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Zhang Derong, the squad leader of the same Defense Corps team, who lives at No. 250 Fangxie Road, and team member Gu Hong, both armed, were waiting in front of Feng's house. Thinking it was still early, Zhang was cleaning his handgun when it suddenly went off accidentally. In a panic, he threw it on the ground. Unexpectedly, the gun fired four bullets in quick succession, injuring Zhang in three places on his left hand, left foot, and right foot. Stray bullets hit Zhao Huilian (6 years old), a girl living next door at No. 8, in the left leg, and Chen Baodi (12 years old, from Ningbo), a girl living across the street at No. 2, in the left kneecap. Fellow team members Gu Hong and Feng Zhijie, as well as beat police, rushed to send the injured to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment. The squad leader's injuries were serious, while the two girls were less critical. Chen Baodi's knee joint was injured and may be disabled. The Ximen Branch Director's police went to the scene of the incident, as well as the Defense Corps headquarters, to investigate the incident and reported it to the General Bureau for review. The handgun's serial number is 5444, which belongs to Gu Hong and was lent to squad leader Zhang Derong. It has now been taken into custody by the team headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Three-Wheeler Industry Opposes Modifications, Sends Letter to Chinese Directors for Negotiations <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Please consider the hardship of workers and fight the Municipal Council. The Board of Directors and Supervisors held a meeting yesterday to inform members to wait quietly for a resolution.</p>
<p>The city's Three-Wheeler Mutual Aid Association, in opposition to the Municipal Council's implementation of tire modifications and weight restrictions, held a joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors at the association's office yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, resolving to send a letter to the Chinese directors and committee members of the Shanghai Ratepayers’ Association of the Public Concession to negotiate and argue the case. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Board of Directors and Supervisors Meeting: The association held a joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors at the association's office yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than ten directors and supervisors attended, including Shen Yong, Zou Shisong, Yuan Qixiang, Yuan Guisheng, Chen Baoxiang, Zhou Chuanzeng, Ke Hua, and General Director Ge Futian. The meeting was chaired by Shen Yong, with Xu Chengde as the recording secretary. After the formal opening ceremony, the following reports were presented: General Director Ge reported on negotiations with the Municipal Council regarding vehicle modifications; the secretariat reported on the letter to the Municipal Council and recent association affairs. Subsequently, the following cases were discussed: Regarding the tire modification issue, the Municipal Council has not yet responded to the association's request. How should this be addressed? Resolved: Send a letter to the Taxpayers’ Association and all Chinese directors and committee members, requesting them to negotiate with the Municipal Council. Inform members not to panic and to quietly await a resolution before the new regulations are implemented. The case of consolidating members' unpaid membership fees was discussed and resolved to issue separate notices for collection. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Negotiations: The association sent a letter to the Shanghai Ratepayers’ Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating that the association is negotiating with the Public Concession Municipal Council regarding the modification of tires and the weight restrictions on three-wheelers, requesting consideration of the difficult times and flexible handling. It stated that the announcement by your Bureau regarding the modification of three-wheeler tires to be implemented on July 1st has caused significant impediments to the association's members in terms of use and economy, causing deep anxiety and numerous requests to your Bureau to suspend implementation. The reasons why members cannot accept the modifications are summarized as follows: The old-fashioned wheels of three-wheelers are lightweight and suitable, and there has never been any inappropriateness. If wider, three-and-a-half-inch angled iron wheels are added, they will inevitably be clumsy and heavy, making it difficult to operate. If rubber tires are installed, the unevenness of the roads will make them inconvenient to try and use. In addition, each set of rubber tires costs at least 16 national dollars and can only be used for one year, which is several times more expensive than the old-fashioned iron wheels, which cost only 3 national dollars per set and can be used for more than ten years. In terms of the cost of building a three-wheeler, it does not exceed 20 dollars. Now the price of one wheel is so high that, in the current situation of economic depression and declining business, how can those who earn a living by the sweat of their brow suddenly bear such a burden? Therefore, in fact, it is impossible to accept either the modification of iron wheels or rubber tires. As for the weight restriction on three-wheelers, due to the excessive restrictions, violations occur frequently, causing unspeakable pain in business. It should be requested that the load limit for single-person vehicles be set at 700 pounds, and the load limit for double-person vehicles be set at 1,000 pounds. We have already appealed to you, and now we must inform you again, urging your Bureau to consider the hardship of the workers and the suffering of their lives, to suspend implementation and to handle the weight issue with flexibility. We, the three-wheeler industry, are already struggling to maintain a living in these difficult times. If we make more changes and add to the burden, it will be tantamount to forcing us to close down and driving people into a desperate situation. We dare to express our urgent words, imploring your association (Chinese directors and committee members) to consider the hardship of the workers and the suffering of their lives, to quickly negotiate and argue the case based on reason, so as to secure our business. We look forward to your help.</p>

<p>Plans have been drawn up and can be started as soon as the funds are available. The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association has been notified of the approval.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association believes that the import of rayon and other woven goods is increasing year by year, which has a significant impact on the production and sales of domestic silk. The Executive Committee has resolved to submit proposals to the Ministries of Finance, Interior, and Industry, suggesting that the import of foreign rayon and other woven goods be restricted in stages each year, and that a rayon factory be established, and that the use of domestic goods be promoted, in order to recover rights and block leaks. In addition to the approvals already received from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance, the association has now received a reply from the Ministry of Industry, Business Letter No. 44651, which states that a telegram from Qin on May 27, 1936, was received, requesting that the import of rayon and other woven goods be restricted and banned in stages each year, and that a rayon factory be established, and that the use of domestic goods be promoted. The contents of the Qin telegram have been noted. Regarding the promotion of the use of domestic goods, in addition to government officials, a committee for the use of domestic goods has already been established. The other points should be considered as the situation warrants and then dealt with if necessary. As for the request to establish a rayon factory, detailed plans have already been drawn up and can be started as soon as the funds are available. Also, the request to restrict and ban the import of foreign rayon and other woven goods cannot be implemented for the time being and should be considered later. You are hereby notified. Minister Wu Dingchang.</p>

<p>Amitabha Sutra and others have already been given away.</p>
<p>Guo Taidi, a Chaozhou merchant in Shanghai, is committed to education, enjoys Buddhist studies, and generously helps the masses, which has long been praised by the scholars. Recently, he entrusted the Datong News Agency to donate finely engraved Buddhist scriptures to all walks of life through the agency in order to spread the good karma. Due to the large number of requests, the scriptures have already been given away. Now, Mr. Guo has reprinted his Heart Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom, Master Yuan Zhongfeng's exhortation to recite the Buddha, and other types of calligraphy in regular script, and entrusted the agency to donate them to all walks of life. These couplets are classified, mounted, and extremely beautiful. They are all written by contemporary celebrities, such as the current Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, and former Minister of Justice, Dong Kang. They are very precious. However, the number is limited. Those who wish to request them must submit a letter of introduction from a Buddhist organization and request them from the Datong News Agency at No. 8, Lane 439, Baker Road.</p>

<p>The Nantong Native Place Association sends separate letters to the Municipal Council, etc. Ji Amao, who was detained for no reason, should be released immediately.</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Nantong Native Place Association in Shanghai, regarding the case of fellow villager Ji Shilin, who was shot and killed by Sun Qihua, a Chinese detective No. 76 of the French Concession police, due to a dispute over tea money at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road in the French Concession on the 6th of this month, has sent separate letters to the French Concession Municipal Council, the Shanghai Ratepayers’ Association of the French Concession, the Civil Union of the Second Special District, and the Local Court of the Second Special District, stating that the Association received a letter from Ji Yang's wife (details omitted). Ji Shilin is a native of Nantong and currently lives at No. 24 Lanxin Lane, Bai’er Road, French Concession, earning a living as a coolie. He is extremely honest and reliable and has never committed any crime. Now, he was innocently killed because of his brother's debt. Sun Qihua, as a detective, treats human life as worthless. Afterwards, he falsely reported resisting arrest and detained Ji Amao, while the culprits Wu A’gen and Chen Xiangrong were released and escaped justice, which is extremely unlawful. If this is not thoroughly investigated, the residents of our concession will be in a state of constant fear. We have been requested to come forward, and we hereby submit a letter, urging your Bureau (Association, Court) to uphold justice, quickly investigate and punish the murderer severely, and release Ji Amao, who was arrested innocently, in order to maintain humanity and ensure social stability.</p>

The family reported the case to the French police for investigation. Gong was arrested for committing a similar fraud case in the Public Concession and sent to the First Special Court for prosecution and interrogation, where he was sentenced to four months in prison. Detective Hang Guangfu of the French police learned of this, reported it to the West Inspector, and requested the Second Special Court to prepare a document to transfer the Shen convict from the First Special Court to the Second Special Court for interrogation and handling. The original stolen goods have been confiscated and he is being held in custody.</p>

<p>Four Robbery Suspects, Including Ma Guisheng</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, at approximately 8 PM, the home of Zhang Peiying, a woman from Wuxi residing at No. 154 Xin Zha Road, was invaded by several robbers. They brandished guns to silence any cries for help, robbing clothing, jewelry, and cash worth 1,898 yuan before fleeing. On the 4th of this month, Zhou Guisheng, a Chinese detective chief from the Huishan Police Department, along with detective Cui Chengke, apprehended four robbery suspects at the Nanyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. The suspects included Ma Guisheng from Nanjing, Li Huasheng from Ningbo, Xu Taotao, and Zhang Chunlin from Chongming. They were handed over to the Special No. 1 Court for investigation and detention, with the case being adjourned. During the investigation, Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case discovered that these individuals, along with Chen Awu (from Taicang), whose case was already handled by the Chengdu Road Police Department, had conspired in March of this year to commit armed robberies at the homes of four households: Wang Boxing at No. 4 Haifang Road, Mao Jinshi at No. 33 Fuzhou Road, Jin Luoshi at No. 53 Chengdu Road, and Zhou Jigen at No. 68 on the same road.

Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, provided a detailed account of the case. Subsequently, the victims testified about their experiences during the robberies. Judge Xiao Xieffen conducted thorough interrogations of the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Two Homes Robbed in One Night in Hexi Township; Robbers Murder an Elderly Woman <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Hexi Township, located south of Shanghai and belonging to Shanghai County, borders the Huangpu River to the south and Songjiang County to the west. On the night of the 12th of this month, a sudden robbery occurred, during which a 64-year-old woman was murdered. Due to the remote location, the incident was not reported to the county for investigation until yesterday, when news began to spread. The victims were identified as the Zhu Fusheng family, residing at No. 1, 7th Jia, 5th Bao, 1st District, and the Zhang Jinfa family, residing at No. 1, 6th Jia, 7th Bao. According to reports, there were six or seven robbers who first targeted the Zhu family at approximately 12 AM that night. However, because the Zhu family's house was newly built and the doors and windows were sturdy, they were unable to break in and fired several shots before abandoning the attempt. Subsequently, at around 2 AM, they broke into the Zhang Jinfa family's home, located about one mile from the previous location, and proceeded to rob them. The Zhang Jinfa couple happened to be out, leaving only a 64-year-old woman at home. The family was impoverished, with no valuables hidden away. When the robbers demanded money and were refused, they opened fire in frustration. The bullet entered through the lower abdomen and exited through the lower back. The elderly woman died yesterday morning from the gunshot wound. Township head Zhang Xinhe has collected the recovered bullet casings and reported the incident to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation. It is believed that the robbers came ashore from the Huangpu River and were unfamiliar with the area. The security team substation, originally established at Zhongdu Bridge, was removed last year, leaving the area vulnerable to theft and robbery.</p>
<h3 id="e111">After the Suicide of Female Worker Ma Xingzhen, Her Husband Accuses Yu Hegui <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Court Investigation Completed; Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>As reported on the 4th of this month, Ma Xingzhen, wife of Shaoxing native Shi Jiliang, residing at No. 40 Xinyi Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, had an argument with Yu Hegui, a male worker at the Chongyang Silk Factory on the same road, and was also swindled out of seven yuan. Unable to bear the anger, she secretly committed suicide by poisoning herself. The court has already confirmed this. It is now learned that the deceased's husband, Shi Jiliang, has hired lawyer Yin Zhiyu to file a private prosecution with the Shanghai District Court against Yu Hegui and Yu Zhuting for public insult, causing her shame and resulting in her death. He requests the immediate arrest of the defendants and their prosecution according to law. He further states that his wife, Ma Xingzhen, worked at the Chongyang Silk Factory at No. 785 Chang'an Road. On the morning of May 21st of this year, she went out to fetch water when she was spotted by the defendant, Yu Hegui, who followed and harassed her. When Xingzhen ignored him, the defendant became angry and publicly cursed her, threatening to prevent her from working at the factory. Xingzhen ran home and told her husband, who tried to reason with him, advising her to be careful and avoid causing trouble. As a result, Xingzhen transferred to the Dechang Silk Factory. Unexpectedly, on May 25th, the defendant, taking advantage of her perceived weakness, gathered Yu Zhuting and over ten others and stormed into the plaintiff's home, shouting abuse and causing a disturbance. Yu Zhuting in particular made various threats, demanding money for settling the matter. Because the defendants were numerous and powerful, the plaintiff borrowed seven yuan and feasted them at a local restaurant. In brief, on the morning of the 2nd of this month, Xingzhen suddenly became agitated and refused to reveal the truth when repeatedly questioned. She was rushed to Pushan Hospital, where it was discovered that she had taken poison. She died at noon. The court confirmed the incident. In light of the above, the defendants have committed crimes under Articles 309 and 346 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff requests the court to arrest the defendants and prosecute them according to the law to uphold justice. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the plaintiff and defendants for an investigation on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and ordered a sentence to be delivered on the 19th.</p>

<p>Wang Xiao A'yu Implicates Chen A'san; Initially Hid in Dug-Out Cave in Laoyingpan; Further Investigation Due to Likely More Accomplices</p>
<p>On the night of May 9th, the stolen goods depository of the Shanghai District Court was broken into, and twenty new-style handguns and a radio receiver were stolen. After the District Court issued an arrest warrant, Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective chief from the Yulin Road Police Department of the Public Concession, apprehended the fugitive Wang Xiao A'yu on June 5th and seized twelve stolen guns from the female bandit Wang Shi. They were handed over to the Public Security Bureau and interrogated by the Third Section. The defendant confessed without hesitation. Yesterday, she was transferred to the District Court, shackled, and detained. It is learned that Wang Xiao A'yu confessed to the Public Security Bureau that the case was carried out with Chen A'san, a former worker. Chen A'san entered the court while she guarded the entrance facing the Xiyi Institute. After stealing the items, they hired a rickshaw to dig a cave in Laoyingpan, Xietu Road, where they hid for several days before transporting the goods out. While this confession seems credible, the accomplices likely number more than one or two. Therefore, the court is continuing to conduct a thorough investigation to uncover the entire organization.</p>

The meeting was originally scheduled for the 16th of this month, but has been postponed to 2 PM on the 22nd of this month at the Bureau because the silkworm market in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has not yet closed and silk factory personnel are still purchasing silkworm cocoons inland and are unable to attend the meeting as scheduled.

<p>At approximately 11 PM the day before yesterday, Qian Tianxiong, deputy captain of the Zhabei Xin Zha Detective Squad, received a report from Zheng Baosen, a merchant residing at No. 9 Yukang Lane, Guoqing Road, along with his maid Wang Xiaowu, stating that on the 29th of last month, a letter was delivered to his home by the maid. Upon opening it, it was found to be a blackmailing letter. Because there was no evidence, it was ignored. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, another letter was sent from the post office demanding 1,600 yuan, with even more aggressive language. He then questioned Wang Xiaowu, who revealed that the brother of a girl named Xiao A'mei, a resident of the kitchen shed at No. 101 (i.e., Guoqing Road) across the street, had incited Wang Xiaowu to steal the key to the front door with the intention of theft, which was unsuccessful. Therefore, he sent the blackmail letters twice. The letter was shown as evidence. Captain Qian read the letter and questioned the maid, who claimed to be fourteen years old. Her statement was generally consistent with her master's. Captain Qian then took the maid to No. 101 Guoqing Road, accompanied by the police officer from post No. 1644, and arrested Zhang Jinsheng, the sender of the blackmail letter, at the kitchen shed. Upon questioning, he confessed to being twenty years old, from Suzhou, and admitted to luring the maid to steal the key and sending the blackmail letters twice. During the arrest, a calligraphy practice book belonging to Zhang was found, and the handwriting matched the blackmail letter. He, along with the maid Wang Xiaowu, were sent to the Xin Zha Branch Bureau, and yesterday were transferred to the General Bureau for disposition.</p>

<p>Luo Haitao Claims Yu Baosheng Stole</p>
<p>Yu Baosheng, from Zhenjiang, was recently accused by Luo Haitao, an inspector of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, at the Chenghuangmiao Police Station of stealing four bags of black fungus from the cargo hold of a Yangtze River liner in April of this year. Yu was arrested and handed over to the Public Security Bureau, and then transferred to the District Court for detention. However, while in custody, Yu filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the court against Luo Haitao and Yu Pu, the chief of the Chenghuangmiao Police Station, accusing them of unlawful detention and fraud. The trial was held at 4 PM the day before yesterday by Cai Dingcheng, the head of the Criminal Court. Yu Baosheng testified that he was 36 years old and resided at No. 11 Guanyinge. On the 28th of last month, he was sent to the Chenghuangmiao Police Station by Luo Haitao and detained for more than ten days. He was told that 400 yuan would secure his release. Later, Wang Fukang also came to his wife, claiming that another 400 yuan was needed for his release. They refused, so he was sent to the Public Security Bureau and detained for another three days. He learned that the police chief and Luo were sworn brothers and his case was a frame-up. The judge asked what he meant by suing the police chief. Yu replied that he was not suing the police chief, but only Luo Haitao. Luo Haitao testified that he was 48 years old, from Hubei, and resided at Baiyang Lane, Xiaoximen. He worked as an inspector at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. On April 2nd, four bags of black fungus, worth 428 yuan, were stolen from a Yangtze River ship. He reported it to the Water Patrol Team, but as the inspector, the company required him to compensate for the loss. Later, his colleagues investigated and received a letter indicating that Yu Baosheng was the thief, that he was part of a group of ten dockworkers, and that he sold the stolen goods at the Taikoo Wharf in Xiaochongming. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the police station. Yu asked Wang to mediate, but he insisted on compensating the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for the stolen goods. The judge ordered the case to be adjourned for further testimony.</p>

<p>From the 9th to the 12th of this month, large numbers of bandits from outside the area, as well as ships, firearms, and stolen goods, were intercepted at Yangliu Bridge and Waigang Wangxian Bridge on the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway and escorted to the Jiading County government for investigation. It was learned that these bandits were the same group who had previously robbed Shanlian Town in Wuxing, Zhejiang Province. The group was large, but only ten people were captured this time, along with several suspects, two stolen boats, fourteen rifles, one handgun, over 200 catties of silver ornaments, and cash. The Zhejiang Water Police learned of the matter and dispatched Captain Wu Yibo, Xu Renrong, and several team leaders from the Fourth Water Police Team of the jurisdiction to the Jiading County Public Security Bureau to investigate. Bureau Chief Chen Youmin stated that the case was solved when police officers inspected suspicious pedestrians and discovered that a passerby was carrying silver coins with the Thai character on them, which they determined to be stolen goods. Through further investigation, the case was solved.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Lawsuit Over the Rental Rights of the Mortgaged Film "Tears of a Cripple" <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Hu Zhisheng, from Shanghai, organized the Yihua Song and Dance Troupe last year and toured the interior to perform. Unfortunately, business was poor, resulting in significant losses. He was forced to mortgage the film "Tears of a Cripple," consisting of ten reels and the license, to Yang Jinsheng, the owner of the Shengze Grand Theater (42 years old, from Songjiang, currently residing at No. 49 Zuojie, Songjiang County), for 128 yuan. It was agreed that the loan would accrue interest and the film would be screened by Yang. The proceeds would first be used to repay the principal of the loan, and any remaining funds would be returned to Hu Zhisheng. If the film was not screened, Hu could redeem it within three months. A contract was signed by both parties. Later, Yang exercised his rights and rented the film "Tears of a Cripple" to places like the Great World in Shanghai for screening. However, Hu Zhisheng claimed that Yang had not informed him beforehand and should not have rented the film for screening without permission. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Yang Jinsheng of fraud and breach of trust and requesting an investigation. After the court opened a trial and summoned the parties, it ruled that Yang Jinsheng was not guilty due to insufficient evidence presented by Hu. Hu was dissatisfied with the ruling and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court, but later withdrew the appeal. Yang Jinsheng believes that Hu Zhisheng should not have repeatedly made false accusations and that he has intentionally damaged his reputation. Therefore, he hired lawyer Sha Enpu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Hu Zhisheng of false accusation. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Zhang Chaozu presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court the day before yesterday. The defendant was absent. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant often spread rumors, accusing the plaintiff of being untrustworthy and shameless for secretly screening his film. Therefore, he requested the arrest and prosecution of the defendant. After examining the statement, the court ordered the case to be temporarily suspended pending the plaintiff's confirmation of the defendant's address, after which another summons would be issued.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Court Prepares to Improve Delivery <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Postal Service Sends Specialist to Court; Researching Procedures and Judicial Income</p>
<p>Jiang Yiping, a representative of the Shanghai Lawyers Association at the National Judicial Conference, proposed improving litigation delivery methods. It was decided that civil and criminal summonses, notifications, and judgments would be sent by the postal service instead of through bailiffs and judicial police, thereby completely eliminating delivery fees and travel expenses. However, transcription fees would still be collected. The method for collecting transcription fees would be for the parties to pay the fees first and then the judgments would be sent. All summons return receipts would be printed in a separate format, collected by the postman, and returned to the court. The Judicial Yuan would also consult with the Executive Yuan and instruct the Ministry of Transportation to order the postal service to send a postal worker to each court to manage the receipt and delivery of official documents and report return receipts. The duties of bailiffs and judicial police would be to apprehend criminals and seize property for search. This proposal has been set to take effect on July 1st. The Shanghai District Court has been preparing all procedures in recent days in order to implement it. However, this matter concerns the reform of national judicial procedures, and it is necessary to study the convenience and judicial revenue. Therefore, the Jiangsu High Court is discussing it.</p>
<h3 id="e123">News of Mr. Zhang Xiaolin's Sixtieth Birthday <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>*Shenshi News Agency Report* On the twenty-second of this month, it will be Mr. Zhang Xiaolin's sixtieth birthday. His relatives and friends, considering his blessings upon society and contributions to the Party and the nation, collectively planned a celebration. However, due to the unrest of the times and the economic depression, he repeatedly declined with humility, firmly refusing to accept. Later, through the gentle persuasion of Du Yuesheng, Yu Yefeng, Wang Xiaolai, Yang Hu, Qian Xinzhi, Liu Zhilu, and others, and at the suggestion of his son, Dr. Zhang Fayao, the gifts from all circles would be donated to the World Chinese Students' Association as a construction fund. Mr. Zhang then slightly revealed his willingness, but repeatedly urged that there should be no excessive extravagance. After this news spread, important figures from the Party and the nation, as well as prominent figures in society, joined the initiative one after another. The writer Zhang Shizhao was appointed to draft the birthday proclamation. The "Public Request for Articles Celebrating Mr. Zhang Xiaolin of Cixi's Sixtieth Birthday" recently published in various newspapers is his work. The initial list of initiators included Duan Zhiquan, Chiang Kai-shek, Xiao Focheng, Yu Youren, Du Yuesheng, Yu Yefeng, and one hundred others. Later, Wu Peifu, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Guofu, and three others joined, bringing the total to one hundred and three. On the first of this month, the Zhang Birthday Preparatory Office was formally established at 97 Avenue Edward VII (inside Linji Timber Company). Branch offices for receiving gifts were set up in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hankou at the Bank of Communications, and in Zhang's residence at Yinmajing in Hangzhou. Du Yuesheng was appointed as the director of the preparatory committee, Wang Xiaolai as the deputy director, and Yu Yefeng as the general secretary, responsible for handling all necessary matters. It was divided into eight groups: Yu, the general secretary, concurrently served as the director of general affairs; Xu Caichen served as the director of accounting and general affairs; Qiu Fangmo served as the director of documentation; Mao Heyuan served as the director of decoration; Chu Minyi, Liu Zhilu, and Chen Qun served as the directors of reception; Jiang Gantang served as the director of security; Zhao Nansheng served as the director of banquets; and Wang Xiaolai concurrently served as the director of theatrical affairs. The presidium of the birthday hall has also been determined, including Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Yang Xiaotian, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Weijun, Yu Yefeng, and Du Yuesheng, totaling ten people. It is also heard that the Peking opera circles of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, upon learning of Mr. Zhang's sixtieth birthday, all sent letters and telegrams requesting to participate in the celebratory performances. Those who have already joined include Mei Lanfang, Li Jihui, Ma Lianliang, Wang Youchen, Tan Xiaopei, Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Li Wanchun, Xin Yanqiu, and other famous performers. Many famous amateurs in the Shanghai opera circles are also participating. The birthday celebrations will be divided into three days: the 21st will be a warm-up for relatives and friends, the 22nd will be the actual birthday, and the 23rd will be for guests' entertainment. The birthday hall will be set up in the Great Shanghai Garden on Haige Road in West Shanghai, and decorations are currently being arranged. It is also heard that the organization of each group is very orderly, fearing that idlers may mix in. Therefore, guests who come to offer congratulations must wear badges so that the hosts can easily identify them.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Jiren Association to Found a Chinese Medicine Hospital <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Jiren Aid Association (abbreviated as Jiren Association) began soliciting members, although it has been affected by the economic downturn, people from all walks of life, appreciating the new charter of the association, find that for each piece of wood contributed, members only need to bear five cents of the cost of making the wood, which is easy and affordable. Moreover, including the cost of lime, charcoal shavings, and carrying, it does not cost the bereaved family a penny and avoids any hint of charity. Therefore, those who agree to join the association are quite enthusiastic, and the Ren (Benevolence) Group is about to be established. Currently, members believe that when poor compatriots encounter illness, they lack the resources to consult doctors and take medicine, waiting helplessly for death. Their suffering is even greater than that of the deceased. Saving the dying and giving life should go hand in hand. They request the establishment of a free hospital to provide medical assistance and medicine to benefit the poor and sick. Therefore, the chairman, Shao Ruxin, has decided to cease the operation of the Dayun Hotel, which he founded, and transfer all three floors of the Western-style building, as well as the interior decoration, beds, bedding, etc., to the Jiren Association to establish the Jiren Chinese Medicine Hospital (located in Dakangfang on Baer Road in the French Concession, telephone 84533). Currently, they have secured the services of famous Shanghai doctors Xu Xiangchen, Cai Xunchen, Ren Nongxuan, Jiang Haifeng, and female doctor He Shiqing, among others, to voluntarily provide medical services in various departments. Once the Ren Group of the Jiren Aid Association is established, the Jiren Chinese Medicine Hospital can be realized.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We have received a telegram from the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters stating that recent Shanghai newspapers have published reports that Miao Peinan, the Chief of Staff and Director of the Training Corps of our army, has resigned, and that Zhang Guoyuan and He Luo have succeeded him respectively. This is completely untrue. Please forward this letter to the various newspapers for correction.</p>

<p>This year is the Year of the Child. We hope everyone pays special attention to children's health! When it comes to children's health, we might as well first present the following figures:</p>
<p>(1) China has a population of 400 million, and 12 million people die each year (estimated at 30 per thousand of the total population), of which at least 4.8 million people (accounting for 40% of the deaths) are young children under the age of five.</p>
<p>(2) For every 1,000 births in China, 15 mothers die due to childbirth, and 200 infants under one year of age die.</p>
<p>(3) After physical examinations of children entering school in China, 85% are found to have deficiencies.</p>
<p>The reasons for the above staggering figures are related to economic conditions, but the lack of hygiene in daily life is the most pressing concern. Because in hygiene-conscious countries like Britain and the United States, the above figures have all been reduced by half compared to ours. Therefore, for this reason, we should: (1) Promote maternal and infant hygiene - implement prenatal and postnatal examinations, new-style delivery, infant clinics, home visits, Maternal and Infant Hygiene Association, Preschool Children's Hygiene Association, and other work - to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and reduce the number of deaths of young children under the age of five. (2) Promote school hygiene - implement physical examinations, deficiency correction, vaccinations, disease treatment, and the development of hygienic habits - to prevent children's diseases and improve children's health.</p>
<p>Children are the masters of the future. When we promote hygiene, we should start with children's hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Health Campaign and Children's Health <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>—A Message to the Citizens on the Occasion of the 15th Health Campaign Congress—</p>
<p>Fellow citizens! The annual health campaign is now being held again. However, given the current state of our nation and the increasingly tense international situation, we must not regard this health campaign as a mere annual formality. We should see this work as a means to revive the nation, save it from peril, and ensure its survival. Although the path may be difficult and filled with obstacles, I can say with certainty that this arduous task cannot be undertaken by the old, senile, and infirm. It must be shouldered by those with sound minds. However, a sound mind resides in a sound body, and to maintain a sound body, one must first practice hygiene.</p>
<p>This year is Children's Year, and we should pay even more attention to children's health. Children are the future masters of our country, and we need them to continue the work of saving the nation. Therefore, we should ensure that they first have strong bodies. According to a recent life statistics report from Nanjing, children under the age of five account for eight percent of the city's population, but deaths of children under the age of five account for 45 percent of the city's total deaths. In China, approximately 30 out of every 1,000 people die each year, meaning that about 12 million people die annually out of a population of 400 million. If we use the death rate of children under five in Nanjing as a proportion, then approximately 5.4 million children under five die each year nationwide. This clearly shows the importance of children's health.</p>
<p>To promote children's health, we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Implement maternal and infant health—Whether a plant is good or bad depends on its seed; whether a person is virtuous or foolish, strong or weak, originates in childhood; and whether a child is healthy or not depends on their prenatal and postnatal care. Therefore, to promote children's health, we should simultaneously implement maternal and infant health measures, so that from conception to delivery, from infancy to adulthood, hygiene is always emphasized, and one is always nurtured by a hygienic environment. In this way, from birth to adulthood, their physical fitness will be very sound. Because health facilities are not yet widespread in our country, people in remote rural areas generally do not know what hygiene is. Each year, about 15 out of every 1,000 pregnant women die from puerperal fever because old-fashioned midwives are ignorant of human physiology and disinfection methods and deliver babies without knowledge. Additionally, about 200 to 250 out of every 1,000 infants under the age of one die from convulsions (neonatal tetanus) and other diseases caused by improper care before and after childbirth for similar reasons. In other countries around the world, the infant mortality rate in Japan is 132 per 1,000, in the UK it is 66 per 1,000, and in Australia, which has better health facilities, it is only 42 per 1,000. Our country's infant mortality rate is the same as that of England 250 years ago, but now England has reduced it to 10 percent. This further proves the importance of maternal and infant health.</p>
<p>(2) Improve the children's environment—As the saying goes, "One who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." Children are particularly good at imitating, so it is essential to pay attention to whether the environment is suitable. In the past, Mencius's mother moved three times to educate her son, and Mencius became a rare sage throughout history. This is the benefit of improving the environment.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to children's nutrition—During childhood, the body has not yet fully developed, and extreme attention should be paid to nutrition. If nutrition is poor, the body will not only fail to develop fully, but will also suffer from certain deficiencies that can lead to weakness and disease. According to the results of physical examinations of students in primary and secondary schools in this city conducted by the Municipal Health Bureau, about 13 percent of the students have nutritional deficiencies. Even schoolchildren whose families are relatively wealthy have nutritional deficiencies, so the nutrition of out-of-school children and homeless children is even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>(4) Instill good hygiene habits in children—As the saying goes, "Habit becomes nature," and "Natures are similar, but habits separate people." This shows that good or bad habits are closely related to the development of a person's character. If children have good hygiene habits, their bodies will naturally become stronger.</p>
<p>(5) Popularize health education—Practicing hygiene does not necessarily require spending a lot of money; it may even be free. However, how to be hygienic? How to prevent disease? There must be adequate education to teach those who do not know this common knowledge, especially children, who should receive such health education.</p>
<p>(6) Vigorously implement children's health checkups—Whether a child's body is healthy or not is often unclear without a detailed examination, which reveals whether there are any deficiencies and where they are. Early diagnosis, treatment, and correction should be provided. The physical examination results of primary and secondary school students in this city show that many suffer from dental diseases and trachoma, followed by enlarged tonsils and then malnutrition. According to a survey by the National Health Administration of physical defects among primary and secondary school students in eight major cities across the country, about 52 percent suffer from trachoma, 41 percent have dental diseases, 25 percent have enlarged tonsils, 18 percent have swollen lymph nodes, 14 percent suffer from malnutrition, and 13 percent have vision problems. If such defects can be prevented in advance, their occurrence can be reduced. However, after they are discovered, regardless of their severity, if appropriate methods are used to treat them, they can be restored to health or saved from danger.</p>
<p>(7) Respect children's psychology—Although children are young and have limited experiences and incomplete thoughts, they often have their own unique psychology. They are innocent and genuine. Parents, elder siblings, and teachers should show empathy everywhere, treat them with sincerity, and provide appropriate encouragement and inspiration at all times. For example, when children express their personal thoughts or create something, they will feel interested. If, at this time, parents, elder siblings, or teachers adopt an adult attitude and dismiss it as childish, or ignore it, or talk about other things, or nitpick, or even punish them, this is a barbaric and rude act of trampling on children's pure souls, which will inevitably cause children to doubt or develop antipathy and prevent their thoughts from developing upward. The future happiness of children will inevitably suffer major setbacks.</p>
<p>(8) Promote school health—In the past, education mostly emphasized "teaching" and rarely paid attention to "nurturing." Now, education is gradually changing its focus to "nurturing." Promoting hygiene means emphasizing both "teaching" and "nurturing." All aspects of children's environment, habits, nutrition, health education, physical examinations, and correction of defects can be addressed in schools during their education. As for the health of kindergarten children, it should also be included in the list of things to pay attention to.</p>
<p>In short, children are the new hope of the nation and the future masters of the country. Special attention should be paid to the health of children, who are the new hope of the nation. This is my hope for this year's Health Campaign Congress! June, Year 25, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Preparation Process for the 15th Health Campaign <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Gao</p>
<p>The preparation for this year's health campaign began in early May. Thanks to the support of all parties and the cooperative efforts of various organizations and groups, everything is now in order, and the opening ceremony is officially scheduled for today. I will now report on the preparation process and the special purpose of this year's campaign in summary, which may be of interest to all sectors.</p>
<p>This year's health campaign continues the experience of the previous session and adapts to the needs of the times. The organizational aspect is slightly different from the previous session in that the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association has joined and is working alongside the Health Bureau to fulfill similar efforts. In early May of this year, the Association received a notice from the New Life Movement Promotion General Association to hold a summer health campaign. Subsequently, Director Wu, the Association's instructor and mayor, stated that the city holds a health campaign every year, and although this year's campaign was approaching, he ordered it to be merged and held together, still named the 15th Health Campaign. After the Preparatory Committee's election, the Health Bureau and the New Life Movement Association were appointed as the chairman and secretary-general of the campaign, respectively, to oversee the preparations for this year's health campaign. Many organizations and groups participated in this Preparatory Committee, and they were assigned duties in accordance with the charter. A special list is shown below:</p>
<h3 id="e139">Health Campaign and National Revival <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Diaoyuan</p>
<p>The health campaign is one of the seven campaigns promoted by the central government in recent years. Following this, Chairman Chiang promoted the New Life Movement, emphasizing cleanliness first and foremost, and the movement has swept across the country. Now, during the summer season, Shanghai is holding the 15th Health Campaign to promote the health of all citizens and seek the happiness of mankind. This is truly cause for celebration.</p>
<p>China's health undertakings have been prospering in modern times, providing a safeguard for human life. This barrier that protects our lives is constantly being advanced, and as a result, human happiness is also increasing with the progress of the health campaign.</p>
<p>Shanghai's health facilities are making increasingly significant progress. In terms of drinking water, there is good tap water, and the public is spared from the transmission of parasitic eggs and bacteria. In terms of nutrition, the commercially available food and beverages are subject to inspection and regulation by the competent authorities, so that people do not have to worry about buying rotten fish or meat. In terms of medical administration, doctors, pharmacists, midwives, and nurses must pass examinations and certifications. Hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and drug dealers are also subject to the supervision of the competent authorities. The insurance system is also gradually expanding. All of this is based on the premise of the people's happiness. This shows that Shanghai is meticulous in its public health efforts for the public.</p>
<p>Public health has made considerable progress. However, family health and personal health are also of utmost importance and should not be delayed. It must be understood that hygiene protects individual life and eliminates all dirt and disease-causing microorganisms. Individuals are members of society, and they cannot live apart from society. They are always connected to all individuals or groups and to the nation and its people. If each individual has a healthy body and a spirit of self-improvement, and extends this to others, it will become a common practice, which will not only strengthen our bodies but also serve as the foundation for strengthening the country.</p>
<p>Today, the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and those who conspire against us are becoming increasingly rampant. For the sake of reviving our nation, we must mobilize the entire nation, transform the nation's health, instill hygienic habits in everyone, develop strong bodies, and sweep away the old, weak, and sickly atmosphere. This must begin with enthusiastically participating in the health campaign. Therefore, we know that the foundation of our strength lies in hygiene. Hygiene is the most practical and most fundamental element for reviving the nation. Let us all strive together.</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3 id="e140">World Games Track and Field Representative Zhang Lingjia Disqualified, Decision Made on Three Substitute Track and Field Representatives, Li Huitang's Eligibility Question Under Investigation, Zhou Changxing to Attend Track and Field Events in Germany at His Own Expense <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The China National Sports Association's preparations for our country's participation in this World Games are gradually being finalized. The entire delegation's departure is imminent. However, important matters such as paying respects at the mausoleum in Beijing and listening to instructions, as well as the selection of athletes by the Track and Field and Swimming Selection Committee, must be reported to the Board of Directors for approval. Therefore, the Association's Honorary Secretary-General, Shen Gangliang, sent letters inviting Standing Directors Chu Minyi, Hao Gengsheng, and Wu Yunrui to hold the fifth Standing Directors Meeting in the Association's conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday, and invited directors in Shanghai, Ma John and Song Junfu, to attend and discuss together. The meeting lasted for five hours before adjourning. The minutes of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Minutes of the Fifth Standing Directors Meeting of the China National Sports Association:</p>
<p>Attendees: Hao Gengsheng, Shen Siliang, Chu Minyi, Wu Yunrui; Observers: Ma John, Song Junfu; Chairman: Chu Minyi; Recorder: Shi Zhaokang.</p>
<p>A. Report Matters</p>
<p>Recent economic situation; Track and field team selection process and training situation; Swimming and race walking selection process; National martial arts and weightlifting training situation;</p>
<p>B. Discussion Matters</p>
<p>How should the delegation go to Beijing to listen to instructions and the flag-receiving ceremony be handled? Resolution: Decide to take the 7:55 AM train to Beijing on the 23rd to pay respects at the mausoleum and listen to instructions, and return to Shanghai at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. All affairs in the north and south will be handled by Directors Chu and Hao. Request to review and approve the selected candidates for swimming, track and field, and race walking. Resolution: Swimming: Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong were selected as representatives. Race walking: Cai Zhengyi and Zhou Yuyu (both sent by this association), Zhang Zaojiu and Zheng Chengshan (both funded by the China Race Walking Association) were selected as race walking representatives.</p>
<p>(A) Track and field: Chuan Jincheng, Jia Lianren, Chen Baoqiu, Wu Bixian, Wang Shilin, Huang Yingjie, Liu Changchun, Dai Shuguo, Cheng Jin, Wang Zhenglin, Lin Shaozhou, Leng Peigen, Guo Jie, and Li Sen were selected as representatives.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the amateur eligibility issue, Director Ma reported that Zhang Lingjia had indeed been working in the library of the Physical Education Department of Tsinghua University since graduating last year. However, the title on his employment letter was mistakenly filled in as a physical education teaching assistant, which is inconsistent with amateur rules. In order to maintain amateur rules, it is requested that the Board of Directors make a public decision. Resolution: Stop sending Zhang Lingjia as a track and field representative to the World Games decathlon event, and no substitute representative will be sent.</p>
<p>C. Decision: Zhang Jiakui, Situ Guang, and Hao Youde were determined to be substitute track and field representatives to fill vacancies in order of priority.</p>
<p>D. In the pole vault event, Fu Baolu insisted on participating in the preliminary selection on the 7th of this month despite being ill. After a doctor's diagnosis, he was instructed to stop participating. The Selection Committee suggested that a supplementary test be conducted on the 16th of this month. Father Zha Wang Hezhi's pole vaulting performance was quite good. In order to select true talent, he was specially allowed to participate in the supplementary test at the same time as Fu Baolu. If both of them perform well in the supplementary test, in addition to sending the first place, the second place will be made a substitute track and field representative.</p>
<p>E. Zhou Changxing's request to attend track and field events in Germany at his own expense. Resolution: Zhou Changxing's performance is still good, so he is allowed to participate at his own expense.</p>
<p>Regarding the amateur eligibility of Li Huitang, captain of the football team, Honorary Secretary-General Shen reported that he had read in a Shanghai newspaper on May 29 that Li Huitang, captain of the football team, was suspected of violating amateur sports rules, and requested a public decision on how to handle this.</p>
<p>Resolution: Send a letter to Li Huitang himself, asking him to state the facts to the Association, and send a letter to the relevant newspaper to explain the truth and submit it for discussion at the next Board of Directors meeting.</p>
<p>In order to avoid athletes participating in this World Games from violating amateur sports rules, anyone who wishes to participate in various competitions and performances in the future must obtain a special permit from this Association before being allowed to participate. Should this be publicly decided?</p>
<p>Resolution: A permit from this Association must be obtained before being allowed to participate.</p>
<p>(A) Appoint Zhang Boling (convener), Hao Gengsheng, and Jiang Xiangqing as members of the committee to revise amateur sports rules. Resolution: Passed and designated Honorary Secretary-General Shen Siliang as an ex officio member.</p>

<p>National martial arts athletes perform national martial arts and screen films</p>
<p>China Sports Association and three other organizations host a farewell banquet</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city and the German Consulate-General in this city hosted a reception for our country's World Games athletes at the Grand Cathay Theatre at 10:30 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu, German Consul-General Bernait, Chu Minyi, and others gave speeches and screened Olympic films. At 12:00 PM noon, the China Sports Association, the Jingwu Athletic Association, and the China Wushu Association hosted a farewell banquet for all the World Games athletes at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Grand Occasion</p>
<p>The reception hosted by the mayor and the German Consul-General for the World Games athletes was held at the Grand Cathay Theatre at 10:30 AM yesterday. More than a thousand people attended, including athletes from our country who participated in the World Games in track and field, national martial arts, and weightlifting, as well as guests from all walks of life. The Chinese and German Boy Scouts maintained order, and the flags of the Chinese and German parties and countries were suspended above the stage, creating a solemn and warm atmosphere. At the beginning of the ceremony, the Chinese Kuomintang party anthem and the German National Socialist Party anthem were played, and everyone stood in solemn respect.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng first delivered a welcoming speech. The original text stated: "Distinguished guests, athletes, the grand occasion of China's participation in the World Games is an unprecedented event in our country's sports history. The athletes this time have all come through strict competitions, and it is not an exaggeration to say that they represent the essence of China's sports world. Given the excellent results of recent tests, it is right to have high hopes for the success of the athletes. This time, you represent the motherland and travel across the ocean. In addition to bidding you farewell, we sincerely hope that you will strive to compete and return with honors, so that China's sports can share the world's glory with its inherent culture and art. However, the expression of the spirit of sportsmanship is more important than winning medals. When you compete with athletes from various countries, if you can adhere to the spirit of sportsmanship, then China's glory will be even more valuable than winning medals. The strict competitions you have undergone recently can prove that continuous efforts will definitely yield excellent results. When you compete with athletes from various countries, you should work hard. No matter what the result, this experience will be beneficial to your future progress. It can be asserted that Germany has made amazing progress in politics, economy, society, and military preparations in recent years. This World Games will be held in Berlin, and it is fortunate that you will have the opportunity to visit and broaden your horizons. The friendship between China and Germany has always been harmonious, and their ideas for maintaining world peace are particularly consistent. We hope that this trip will allow you to convey the goodwill of the people of Shanghai to the people of that country and to other representatives participating in the World Games. We wish you a successful expedition."</p>
<p>Speech by the German Consul-General</p>
<p>Next, the German Consul-General Kribai delivered a speech, stating briefly: "On behalf of my country's government, I extend my sincere congratulations to your country's World Games delegation. For this Olympic Games, which will be held in Germany this summer, I and the German organizations in Shanghai extend our sincere welcome and wish you success and enjoyment of the honor of the Games, and then a safe return home."</p>
<p>Speech by Bernait</p>
<p>Subsequently, Bernait, chairman of the Western Track and Field Committee, delivered a speech, stating briefly that Chinese sports have been developing gradually, and its equipment has also been improving day by day. He hopes that this participation in the World Games will be based on the spirit of sportsmanship and strive hard. Finally, Chu Minyi gave a speech stating briefly that the nine Chinese national martial arts athletes who participated in the World Games have already been selected. National martial arts are our country's inherent national essence and will be promoted to various countries around the world along with the World Games.</p>
<p>National Martial Arts Performance</p>
<p>Chu also introduced the national martial arts athletes' performance, which included: Jin Shisheng's Shaomo boxing; Liu Yuhua's Dragon Walk Sword; Chuan Shuyun's Fourteen Styles; Zhang Erding's Six Harmony Double Sabers; Zhai Lianyuan's Four-Way Chaquan; Wen Jingming's Flower Spear; Zhang Wenguang's Five-Way Chaquan; Kou Yunxing's Spring and Autumn Saber; Jin Shisheng's Single Saber; Wen Jingming and Zhang Wenguang's Opposing Fists; Kou Yunxing and Zheng Huaixian's Single Saber Advancing Spear; Zhai Lianyuan and Zheng Huaixian's Double Sabers Advancing Spear; Wen Jingming and Zhang Wenguang's Unarmed Spear Disarming; and Zheng Huaixian also performed the dance with the stone dumbbells. For a time, applause thundered, winning unlimited praise from the audience.</p>
<p>Screening of Films</p>
<p>Finally, Olympic films were screened, showing the evolution of the Olympics from Olympia in Roman times, as well as the locations of each Olympic Games, until the construction projects of the venue for the 11th Games currently held in Berlin, the scenery of various parts of Germany, and abridged versions of various sports. The scale was grand, and the audience praised it unceasingly. The event did not end until around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Banquet by Three Organizations</p>
<p>All the athletes and a part of the guests dispersed from the Grand Cathay and then went to the YMCA to attend the banquet hosted by the China Sports Association, the Jingwu Athletic Association, and the China Wushu Association. A total of more than a hundred people attended, including Chu Minyi, Wu Tiecheng, German Consul-General Kribai, Shen Gangliang, Hao Gengsheng, Li Dachao, Hu Puan, Zhang Xingbai, Shao Rugan, and the athletes. Chu Minyi presided over the event and delivered a farewell speech, extending his regards to the athletes.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<p>Next, German Consul-General Kribai gave a speech, which was translated by Su Huixiang, stating briefly: "Today, I personally watched the national martial arts performance, and its brilliance was unprecedented. I had previously seen national martial arts performances in the Chinese military, but they were not as wonderful as today's. This trip to Germany to perform will surely be welcomed. I wish you all a smooth journey." Finally, Hao Gengsheng, sports supervisor of the Ministry of Education, and Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters gave speeches. The meeting did not end until around 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Quick Sketch of Sending Off World Games Athletes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The soccer players participating in the World Games have already departed. The basketball and swimming athletes have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the track cycling athletes have not been announced. Currently, only the track and field and national martial arts athletes are in Shanghai. The German Consul in Shanghai and Mayor Wu Tiecheng jointly hosted a send-off event yesterday morning at the Grand Theatre. Many people attended, and the atmosphere was solemn. I think the purpose was to watch the historical films of the Olympics.</p>
<p>I arrived at the Grand Theatre at ten o'clock, and the inside and outside of the entrance were crowded with people. Boy Scouts were stationed at each entrance. Those with tickets walked into the main hall or upstairs with a satisfied look, under the imposing gaze of the "sentries." Those without tickets lingered at the entrance. There were also a "large number" of beautiful female guests.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the theatre, Boy Scouts held hands to block the way. "Female guides" temporarily transferred from the Cathay Theatre received the guests' tickets, and the Boy Scouts let you through. The "female guide" then led you to your seat according to the seat number on your ticket. Therefore, the entrance was always crowded, but everyone was very polite, following the order of arrival in a well-mannered way.</p>
<p>Around ten-thirty, the theatre was almost full. There were no fewer female guests than male guests. There were also many foreigners, probably all expatriates under the jurisdiction of the German Consul, under the banner of the swastika, including two or three German female students. The only female track and field athlete, Miss Li Sen, wearing a dark gray printed silk cheongsam, looked very simple and elegant. She entered with Liu Changchun, Wang Shilin, and others, and sat directly in front of the stage. The radio continuously played pleasant music, with the Olympic opening march playing until the curtain rose. In the center of the stage curtain was the German swastika flag with red background and black characters, with our national party flag on both sides. Everyone in the audience was dreaming of the "Olympics."</p>
<p>At ten thirty-five, the party anthem was played on the radio. Everyone in the audience stood up with a "whoosh." The anthem was played beautifully, not as monotonous as we usually hear in ordinary orchestras. After the party anthem finished, everyone stood up again with a "whoosh" less than a minute after sitting down. Foreign men and women, as well as a group of female students, raised their right arms diagonally, standing very solemnly and silently, respectfully listening to the German national anthem.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu appeared in front of the dark curtain and gave a speech in Mandarin, followed by an English self-translation; both were read from the original manuscript. After a round of applause, there was another round of applause. Like a gentleman in a "cartoon" painting, the German Consul Kreipe, wearing a swallowtail coat, strode out and gave a speech in German, followed by an English self-translation. Next was Mr. White, a leader in the Shanghai expatriate sports community, who gave a speech in the most fluent English. He wanted to say all his words in one breath, with very fluent and clear articulation; he really had something. A sports figure cannot be separated from the attitude of a sports figure. At the end, he said: "In victory, be a bright victor; in defeat, be a bright loser." Finally, Dr. Chu Minyi came out, wearing a white tight-fitting top and white breeches. He first gave a speech in Shanghai-style Mandarin, then suddenly switched to French, which all looked very unique.</p>
<p>After the speeches, there was a national martial arts performance. Three women and five men, wearing matching white spun silk clothes and pants, came onto the stage from behind the curtain. They first lined up and marched on the stage, directed by a gentleman in the corner of the stage. These were our national martial arts athletes attending the World Games. Then they came out individually to perform, either boxing, swordplay, or weapons, or sparring. We already knew how our national martial arts athletes would be playing at the World Games. Foreigners welcomed sparring the most, especially weapons sparring, with enthusiastic applause filling the room. One person who performed with "plates" received the most applause, and he became even more energetic.</p>
<p>The movie started, and everyone wanted to see the historical films of the Olympics. The opening scenes were several "ruin" shots and the memorial tower of a warrior wearing a flower crown, which was probably the place where the Greek Olympics originated. Then, the locations of each meeting since 1896 were shown, with subtitles indicating the scene of the meeting. After 1912, a cross suddenly appeared, standing in the misty smoke, indicating that the Sixth World Games were sacrificed in the fires of the European War. One shot for each session, this was probably history.</p>
<p>After the history passed, it was the preparation situation of the 11th German session. First, scenes of scenery from various places in Germany and various great buildings in Berlin were projected. If you want to admire these landscapes and buildings, you have to go to Berlin. After that, there were spectacular scenes of the winter sports of the next World Games, and the original sites, foundations, and construction of various other stadiums; behind each scene, the future competition situation was faintly lined up. These shots were connected with fragments of previous World Games films, symbolizing the future lively situation. Each shot was very beautiful.</p>
<p>After watching the movie, the so-called "Olympic historical film" did not impress me much. But the German's working spirit and propaganda methods made me admire them to the extreme. (Huai)</p>

<h3 id="e155">Children's Education and National Salvation Movement (I) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Education Director Pan Gongzhan Speaks on Central Radio</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, was invited by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee to broadcast a speech on the Central Radio Station from 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM on the 14th, with the topic "Children's Education and National Salvation Movement." The full text of the speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today, at the invitation of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, I will give a lecture on children's issues to everyone. The predetermined issue is "Children's Education and National Salvation Movement."</p>
<p>At present, China cannot deny that it has reached a very serious period of national crisis, and it is the final moment of life and death. All over the country, except for a few who are willing to be traitors and willing to be slaves of a conquered country, no one is not doing their best to save the country from the crisis. Although the responsibilities are light and heavy, and the tasks are different, the direction of progress and the goals to be achieved are exactly the same. In other words, at this moment of life and death, every member of the country is working hard in their own position. This has become a consistent phenomenon throughout the country. Originally, there is more than one way to save the country. As long as everyone contributes their strength to the country and works hard for the country, it will be called saving the country.</p>
<p>The work that we in the education sector undertake is to cultivate healthy citizens for the future and establish an unshakable foundation for the country for thousands of years. In the current environment, since the national crisis is so serious, then the healthy citizens we need to cultivate are of course citizens who are sufficient to cope with the national crisis environment and have the power to resolve the national crisis. The causes of past national crises are not one, and we don't need to mention them. However, the future rise and fall of the national fortune is on our shoulders. How heavy should our responsibilities be? Since the responsibility of educators is so great, then what is the situation of education in general elementary schools? Posting a few slogans, shouting a few slogans, or having a national salvation training week and a national salvation unit design, can it be said that it is education worthy of the revival of the nation?</p>
<p>We should know that this kind of unsustainable facility is only enough to arouse children's temporary excitement. Once the five-minute heat is over, the efficiency is equal to zero. It is by no means a truly effective and practical method, and it cannot be said to be the national salvation education we need. Therefore, Mr. Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee, once said, "Pay more attention to the preparation of strength, and don't just vent anger." This is really the golden rule for us to implement education during the national crisis. The education implemented in general elementary schools has committed the fault of "just venting anger." Originally, the work of saving the country cannot be effective in one day or one night. We must have continuous perseverance to do it before we can achieve results. If we use empty words to save the country and act emotionally, where can we get real and permanent effects? Education with the power to save the country cannot be effective with empty words, nor can it be successful with temporary excitement. Then, how can we implement it to achieve satisfactory results? In a word, it is necessary to put in persistent, long-term, and practical effort on the foundation and fundamentally. The so-called "ten years of reproduction" (that is, education), "ten years of training" (that is, teaching) is a good example for us to implement education during this national crisis. We should then follow this spirit and move forward.</p>
<p>Some people think that education during the national crisis must be changed to a new pattern. In fact, it is not necessarily needed, because the purpose of education in our Republic of China is "to enrich the people's lives, support the survival of society, develop the national economy, and continue the life of the nation based on the Three Principles of the People, so as to achieve national independence, universal civil rights, development of people's livelihood, and promote world harmony. This educational purpose is inherently in line with the needs of today's national crisis environment.</p>

<h3 id="e156">The Development and Calculation of War Expenses <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>"One" The Most Brain-Taxing Point</p>
<p>The gunpowder scent of twenty years ago has permeated the entire globe since the September 18th Incident. The general staffs of imperialist powers are now working on economic preparations for wartime. In order to avoid repeating past mistakes, they are meticulously organizing economic institutions suitable for the demands of war, extensively replenishing combat resources, and burying themselves in studying how to obtain strategic raw materials, accumulate necessary reserves, and stimulate new production. The so-called wartime controlled economy, wartime industrial mobilization, and wartime financial preparations are now being deployed in part or in full in various countries. What taxes their brains the most, and what they are most enthusiastic about researching, is the calculation of future war expenses.</p>
<p>Originally, the first financial problem a country needs to solve before entering a war is how much war expenditure needs to be prepared. Especially the emergency expenditures at the very beginning of the war must be planned and prepared in advance. But how much is needed? This is an important question. Furthermore, after the war begins, the continuous expenditure of war funds, according to the general situation, always increases sharply. But what is the rate of increase? And what is the height when it reaches the highest point? These are also important questions. Although this depends on the scale of the future war and the state of its development, to adapt to changes as they occur and make appropriate decisions. But there must be a general idea in advance. This is the lesson the European War taught them!</p>
<p>In the past, the characteristics of the major war preparations of various countries' general staffs mostly embraced the policy of quick battles and quick resolution. They denied the possibility of a long-term war, believing that the war in the first few months should be extremely tense. If victory is quickly achieved, all economic difficulties will be completely resolved. This gave rise to various practical effects: the conscription of the entire skilled labor force, the unrestricted requisition of agriculture, and, most importantly, the hope of waging war with mobilized reserves. They thought that war itself could adjust the preparations. However, reality denied their calculations. In order to cope with the conditions of a prolonged war and raise continuous huge expenses, they had to issue banknotes indiscriminately, sowing all the evils of wartime and post-war inflation. Not wanting to repeat past miscalculations, the imperialist financial authorities have once again delved into an old account of past wars, trying to discover how to make financial preparations adaptable to the development of the war. The calculation of war expenses has become one of the most brain-taxing and most enthusiastically researched issues for them.</p>
<p>These kinds of problems have now been brought before us due to the compulsion of the environment. However, no matter what, we want to seek precise and striving predictions, which in fact is always impossible. Only within the realm of possibility, based on the past records of various countries' wars and our own wartime experiences, can we speculate on the scale of future wars and the future trends of prices, and then estimate a standard from a general perspective. With a general standard, there can be a basis for financial standards, so that it can carry out its mission.</p>
<p>[Two] Three Paths</p>
<p>The methods commonly used to estimate the monetary amount of war expenses generally follow the following three paths:</p>
<p>Estimate the direct war expenses required for each battle, and extrapolate the degree of increase based on the war years; then extrapolate how much the future war will increase compared to the last war?</p>
<p>Divide the same war into several stages, and then observe how much war expenses are required in each period, and determine the degree of increase in each period; in order to determine the expenses for emergency expenditures as scheduled at the beginning of the war, and the rate of increase of continued war expenses, and the degree to which they reach the highest point.</p>
<p>According to past experience, the actual situation of peacetime military expenditures, and the customs and living standards of our country's social life, estimate the average amount of war expenses required per soldier per day during wartime; and then extrapolate to the total amount of war expenses for the whole in a certain period, or the whole period.</p>
<p>At the same time, when estimating future war expenses, also pay attention to the following relationships:</p>
<p>The difference between wartime expenses and war expenses. Wartime expenses include normal expenses, which cannot be cancelled, but must be saved and reduced as much as possible. War expenses are purely for maintaining the war. In order to ensure victory in the war, everything is exhausted to satisfy it.</p>
<p>The difference in living habits and living expenses in various countries. It is a reasonable method to refer to the war experiences of other countries to estimate the needs of one's own country's war. Because the tactics and formations have their own characteristics and secrets, but their trends are generally consistent. However, the differences in the social living habits and living standards of various countries must be distinguished. For example, American soldiers' living habits are much more extravagant than ours; at the same time, the American society's living standards are much higher than ours. Therefore, there is a big difference in the cost of rations for soldiers.</p>
<p>The difference in prices in various periods. Prices in the same space do not differ much; but prices at different times change greatly. If we use the war expenses during the European War as a standard, we must pay attention to the price difference between the past and the present. Not only that, wartime prices are bound to be more expensive than peacetime. And even in the same wartime, the prices in each period can vary greatly. Therefore, we must pay special attention to the estimation of war expenses.</p>
<p>The main mission of wartime finance is to obtain the currency that represents war expenses. Only by using currency can we obtain the materials needed for war. If one's own country lacks war materials and must rely on foreign countries, then one must also estimate the changes in exchange rates and freight costs.</p>
<p>With the national mobilization, the economic world will be aroused to great changes. On the one hand, people are panicked, and the entire economic world is plunged into a state of chaos. On the other hand, the peacetime economic organization is transformed into a wartime economic organization in order to adapt to the necessity of the environment. Overcoming the state of chaos and assisting the adjustment of economic organizations all require a large amount of capital, and the amount may not be less than the war expenses required at that time. Although this cannot be included in the direct war expenses, it must be estimated in advance and prepared accordingly.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also necessary to understand the relationship that the more developed science is, the more war expenses increase. Because future wars are a collection of the elites of modern technology, competing with the enemy's forces. The last European war was a specimen of mutual resistance using machinery and factory productivity. Therefore, wartime industry produces and destroys to adapt to the limitless consumption of war; the result is that war expenses reach an unbelievable number. And this phenomenon will be expanded more and more in the future.</p>
<p>[Three] Calculation of the Development Degree of General Trends</p>
<p>To use the first method to extrapolate, we must first estimate the cost of each battle since modern times. Nitti once made a comparison table of the costs of major wars from the nineteenth century to the European War. From this, we can see the trend of the development of modern war expenses. (Those marked with ▲ are omissions from the original table)</p>
<p>(Note) The material is based on the quotation from Yin Wenjing's "Extraordinary Fiscal Theory." According to Bogart, "War Costs and Their Financing," the former was originally 3 billion US dollars, which was calculated by dividing by 19.3 US dollars per US dollar. The latter was originally 7 billion US dollars, and the calculation method is the same. See my "History of the Great Powers' Disarmament Diplomacy and Combat" quoted. Published by World Book Company, originally 7.5 billion Japanese yen, calculated by dividing by 12.72 francs per Japanese yen. Based on the statistics of E. R. Seligam, the original amount was 210.935 billion US dollars. Calculated in the same way as above. See "Essaysin Taxation"</p>
<p>Here, it has clearly pointed out the trend that the war expenses of each battle have gradually increased sharply, and especially the most dramatic in modern times. Unfortunately, the extended dates of each war expense have not been calculated, so we cannot calculate the degree of increase in each war expense. Moreover, there seems to be an inconsistency in the magnitude of war expenses such as North and South America, and the gradually expanding trend. Regarding this point, we need to use Dr. Bogart's war expense table, which indicates the dates of the war, and re-examine the amount of daily war expenses. In Bogart's original table, there are still two small-scale colonial wars, but there are no figures for the European War; here, the former is presented and the record of the European War is added separately. However, the estimates of war expenses for the European War vary greatly among individuals. In order to make our speculation more accurate, the main statistics are listed together here.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of the Development Degree of Modern War Expenses</p>
<p>(Note) According to Bogart, "War Costs and Their Financing," direct war expenses are in units of millions of US dollars. Average daily expenses are in units of thousands of US dollars.</p>
<p>Bogart's previous book and "A Study of the Financing of the War and the Aterwar" E.R.A.Seligman, "Essays in Taxation" Joseph Kitting's statistics, originally 38.9 billion pounds, calculated by multiplying by 4.87 US dollars per pound. Japanese Yohtaro Sugimura's statistics, originally 6 billion Japanese yen, calculated by multiplying by 4.9845.</p>
<p>From this table, we can draw the following important conclusions:</p>
<p>First: In the middle of the 19th century, the rate of progress of military weapons at that time was not as great as it is today; and the trend of prices was also more stable than today. However, the war expenses of each war increased more than the last. The smallest difference was an increase of two times. The largest was eight times.</p>
<p>Second: If we compare the cost of the Franco-Prussian War era (late 19th century) with the First European War forty years later, the rate of increase is even more alarming. According to Dr. Bogart's calculations, it increased 15 times. According to Professor Seligman's calculations, it increased 9 times. According to the calculations of British statistician Kitting, it increased 8 times. According to Japanese Sugimura Yohtaro's statistics, although it is the smallest calculated among all, it is also five times as much. Seligman's statistics are based on the official reports submitted by the financial authorities of various countries after deducting the normal national expenses during the war, so they are generally recognized as the closest to the facts, then there is a difference of nine times in the forty years before and after. And things are very interesting (you can only say he is interesting), in the estimation in the sixth section below, the difference between the war and the European War is also increased by nine times.

<h3 id="e157">The Problem of Wheat Flour Self-Sufficiency in Extraordinary Times <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>In China, the South eats rice and the North eats wheat. Rice and wheat are equally important for the people's food, and there has never been any distinction. But in terms of the current situation: Japan has strengthened its troops in North China, and the international situation is no longer the calm and favorable weather of the past! The future of the people's food will also have extraordinary changes. Therefore, the bread problem will soon become one of the serious problems in my country's extraordinary times!</p>
<p>In peacetime, my country's wheat production is about 400 million dan per year. (Note 1) However, due to various reasons such as farmers' retention and inconvenient transportation, according to flour millers: my country's wheat production is only enough for the national flour mills to use for six months. This causes the flour mills to often worry about shutdowns due to lack of raw materials.</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, wheat-producing farmland is occupied by trenches, highways, airports, fortresses, and other military activities. In any case, it is enough to reduce wheat production. And modern tactics, the extension of the front line, are often thousands of miles: new types of trenches cannot be built without sacrificing a large amount of valuable farmland. In our possible prediction, at least 15% of the arable land is occupied by it. Assuming that this prediction is reliable, then my country's wheat production will inevitably be greatly affected. Now try to calculate the area of wheat planting in each province in the 24th year, estimated and published by the Central Serum Experiment Institute, and the situation of arable land reduction should be as follows: (Unit: Municipal mu) (Note 2)</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the reduction of arable land will directly affect the decline of wheat production. And the main wheat-producing area in my country is the so-called four central regions north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River. The national flour mills also take the wheat production in the four central regions as the source. Now from the perspective of regional distribution in extraordinary times: the so-called four central regions are just right for the extraordinary regions in extraordinary times! In the event of an extraordinary incident, the reduction in wheat production will inevitably be more than this number.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of flour milling. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were 85 flour mills in the country. In recent years, the flour industry has not increased or decreased. According to the records of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance: in the first half of the 23rd year, there were 89 flour mills in the country, distributed in the four regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Shandong and Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The annual flour production is about 55 million bags. (Note 3) But when it comes to extraordinary events, can the buildings of the flour mills survive under the overturned nest? We have no certainty about this. Even if it is fortunate to continue working normally, the source of raw materials will inevitably become a major problem. It must be known that when military transport is busy, where will there be spare boats and vehicles to take care of your wheat transportation? Therefore, the flour mills that can be put into operation will inevitably feel the difficulty of "internal transport not following, external transport not entering"! The clever woman can't cook without rice, and she has to be forced to shut down.</p>
<p>Third: In this environment, the price of wheat in the producing areas is bound to plummet due to being blocked by military transport and unable to be transported out. Unlawful traitors, taking this opportunity, buy it from the middle; attempting to disrupt the food organization in extraordinary times. Causing a lack of raw materials in the market, factories forced to shut down; workers unemployed, in order to achieve the purpose of disrupting the security of the rear.</p>
<p>On the other hand, flour consumers will inevitably increase substantially due to the convenience of long-term storage and portability. We also assume that 15% is the increase rate of flour consumers; then it is not difficult to calculate the demand for flour in extraordinary times. According to the records of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance: in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the flour production of national flour mills was 55,232,000 bags. (Note 4) Now calculate with an increase in the flour production rate of 15%, then the national flour production must be 63,516,800 bags. In fact, this number is not reliable; because in the 23rd year, foreign flour imported into China was 595,748 dan; domestic flour imported overseas was 64,572 dan; the excess of foreign flour was 531,176 dan. (Note 5) If this number is added again, in any case, there must be 64 million bags of flour production to be sufficient.</p>
<p>Can the above prediction really meet the needs of extraordinary events? This is too easy! It must be known that the wheat production of the people will not be transported to the market grain by grain and flour by flour for processors to mill. According to Mr. Xu Peikun of the Shanghai Social and Economic Investigation Institute, the wheat transported to the flour mills for milling in the country is limited to 15% of the total wheat production in the rural areas with convenient transportation in the four central regions of my country. (Note 6) The rest of the wheat is kept by the farmers for their own use. The wheat retained by farmers for their own use is listed below: (Unit: Thousands of dan)</p>
<p>One dan of ordinary wheat can produce two bags of flour. The wheat retained by farmers for their own use in the 23rd year amounted to 315,728,250 dan: a part of the wheat inside is seeds, and a part of the wheat is for winemaking. But at least 300 million dan of wheat are milled as raw materials for their own flour. Assuming that 300 million dan of wheat are milled, then 600 million bags of flour can be produced. Weighing the population of my country, this number seems to be in line. From the above speculation, the flour production in extraordinary times will definitely not be enough for the flour production.</p>
<p>In summary. The wheat flour problem in extraordinary times is definitely not a trivial problem. What means do we use to adjust wheat flour self-sufficiency? Based on what I have seen and heard, I offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Limit the amount of wheat retained by the people;</p>
<p>2. Implement a joint guarantee and storage system for wheat;</p>
<p>3. Adjust wheat flour transportation;</p>
<p>4. Use private mills to adjust the flour milling industry;</p>
<p>5. Set a legal price for wheat flour;</p>
<p>6. Implement a fixed quota distribution system for wheat flour.</p>
<p>(Note 1) According to the estimate of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, the national wheat production in the 20th year was 398,040,000 dan, 411,120,000 dan in the 21st year, 396,200,000 dan in the 22nd year, and 371,445,000 dan in the 23rd year.</p>

<p>From June 8th to 13th last week, the market price of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was hit hard again by the southwest calling for troops. Public debt is in a time of suspicion and shock. Furious waves and overlapping layers can be seen everywhere. However, since the currency reform last year, the scope of market speculation has been greatly reduced, and the financial community has mostly felt satisfied and no longer absorbed. The number of transactions has decreased, and the range of ups and downs is also relatively small. However, the amount is too large, and retail investors are busy selling. Therefore, although the forward period has one month's interest, the market price is lower than the recent period. To prevent arbitragers from getting started, the trend last week was mostly getting worse and worse. On Wednesday, due to the southwest mobilization, spot goods were dumped, and after a sharp drop, the four types of new low prices, B, C, D, and E, were discovered. On Thursday, many parties publicized peace and encouraged absorption. Short positions of No. 47 and 48 were all covered, and the price rose by one or two yuan. The multi-party struggle can be said to be a commendable remaining courage. On Friday, the peace talk was not accurate, and No. 47 and 48 were sold again, and the price dropped by about one yuan. On Saturday, the news was dull and tended to brew. Retail investors covered their short positions, and major investors raised their bids, and the price rose by about one yuan again. Looking at the overall situation, it is still difficult to be optimistic. The changes in the current situation will never be so simple. The futures delivery in June is only a few days away. In this unfortunate environment, mutual infighting will be very impressive. The result of the week's market price was mostly a drop of a few corners to one yuan. The total number of transactions was 67.05 million yuan. The comparison of the results of the ups and downs is listed on the left, (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supplies from various gangs suddenly turned prosperous again, with a total of forty-three or four shipments (nearly 9,000 stones of goods), but the local sales were very sluggish. The stomach capacity was only 500 or 600 packages handled by the Dalian gang, so the market situation suddenly saw a downward trend. As a result, the prices of full and thick early japonica rice all fell by one or two corners. Except for the high-quality goods, which were barely stable due to shortages, the price of medium-quality goods in the market also fell by a corner or so. The arrival and sales of Doyang pointed rice and Yinbian rice were similar, and they were still mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, the weather has been hot, and although the arrival of goods from the river is not prosperous, only twenty-two or three, the market's japonica rice stores have turned sluggish, and the price has been weak by five or six points. The arrival of thin rice continued, and the sales were sluggish. The market price was close to a corner. The retail sales of Yinbian yuan rice were still acceptable, and the price was stable. Yangdu pointed rice and port pointed rice were stable, and the price of customer pointed rice was stable. The prices of other goods were generally weak.</p>

<p>Due to the rainy weather, the new goods of midge dried fish have been delayed in the market. The first batch only arrived in four pieces, and the selling price was 25 yuan. The body of the goods was thin and the individual was small, the body was damp and the color was withered, which was second-rate goods after being rained on. Now, another 140 pieces have arrived, and the quality varies. The market price has not yet been made. However, the market price of the existing old goods in the market is gradually increasing. It is found that the Jianbang sold dozens of pieces last week, at a price of 26 yuan and 5 cents. Yesterday, the Jiangxi gang also purchased dozens of pieces, and the price has been raised to 29 yuan to 30 yuan, and the industry is still unwilling to sell in batches, only willing to deal with a small number of them. The market situation is tight, and there is a possibility of continued rise.</p>
<p>Fish maw is abundant in yellow croaker ocean production, and the harvests in various places are said to be abundant, which is very different compared with last year. Therefore, the industry is selling well, and all grades are showing loosening. The current market price of original dried Ning Zhai surface is 125 yuan, handmade goods are 105 yuan, Wenzhou surface glue is 95 yuan, Ning Ti sliced belly is 150 yuan, cotton sliced belly is 130 yuan, yellow sliced belly is 120 yuan, Wenzhou Ti sliced belly is 135 yuan, Gaozhuang Da belly is 130 yuan, second-rate goods are 120 yuan, rootless long glue is 100 yuan, the price of this brand is 95 yuan, the price of the customer brand is 90 yuan, and the price of the miscellaneous brand is 85 yuan. According to people in the industry, the future depends on how the ocean production is harvested in the Dragon Boat Festival, and then determine the prosperity and disgrace of the market.</p>

<p>The Haikou branch goods, the producing area has already seen new goods. Yesterday, I heard that a certain customer specially rushed to pack and ship 12 boxes first. Among them, the cost of the higher-priced goods needs 30 yuan. However, the harvest this year is quite abundant, and the production price is too high, so it may be difficult to promote sales. When more batches arrive, the price will inevitably fall gradually, which should be kept in mind. It is said that the goods will probably arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>

The close was firm, and the spot goods did not move, and the futures fell from not moving to falling by four pound sounds. The spot price of English cotton fell by 5 points, and the futures fell by 34 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to good news about US cotton, and then became weak because Japanese merchants and the public bought in and encountered manipulators selling May futures. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomra fell by half a rupee, and Bairoxi fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (13th telegram)</p>

<p>The Indication of Various Commodity Price Indices in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the report of the National Tariff Commission, compared with the previous month, the wholesale, export and import commodity price index and the cost of living index in Shanghai in May of the 25th year have slightly fallen. The percentage of the fall is the largest at 2.9% for exports, followed by wholesale at 1.4%, and imports and living expenses are the most moderate, all below 0.5%. In recent months, smuggling in North China has become more and more rampant. The types of smuggled goods were initially limited to velvet, cotton cloth, flour, kerosene, gasoline, and various groceries. The sales of smuggled goods were initially limited to North China, but now they have also invaded the Central China area. The price drop this month is probably related to smuggled goods. It is hoped that the government's recent measures to check the import and sales of goods will be effective in preventing them, otherwise the general commodity prices may continue to fall.

<p>— (Xu Tian)</p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon, with nothing to do, I decided to become a "road inspector." Walking along Wusong Road, taking my time, I reached the vicinity of the Triangle Small Vegetable Market and saw a child selling sugared plums. He held a basket in his right hand, filled with green plums, and another basket in his left hand, filled with sugared plums. Nearby were three Western children, around six or seven years old, who were playfully reaching into the basket of sugared plums, grabbing one or two, teasing the child, or throwing them randomly on the ground. The plum-selling child was distracted, preventing one from stealing but unable to prevent another. He wanted to scold them but they couldn't understand, and he couldn't bring himself to cry. Fortunately, an "amah" nearby saw what was happening and stopped them.</p>
<p>Alas! Isn't this a miniature of "the strong bullying the weak?"</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Visit to Tangjiawan <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Under the large brown oilcloth umbrella, someone shouted, "Yellow croaker, ten coppers for one tael!" It went on and on without end.</p>
<p>Endlessly, everyone shouted like this. Selling bamboo shoots, selling goby fish, selling celery, selling… every stall in the market hoped that customers would come their way. The pitiful old woman, blind in one eye, selling bean curd sheets, sat alone shrinking in a corner, calling "Sir," "Madam," and other respectful titles to every man and woman carrying a vegetable basket. However, people passed by without paying attention. Sometimes, she would even hear,</p>
<p>"Now that new broad beans are out, who would eat your old bean curd sheets?" Such heart-piercing words.</p>
<p>In the crowded sea of people, there were nannies of wealthy families, purchasing clerks from commercial firms, housewives from modest households, and the wives of workshop owners. Under the large oilcloth umbrellas, there were the haggling and bargaining of tongues, disputes over the market scale and eighteen taels, the quarrels over adding a little extra and grabbing a little extra, and the mutual accusations of freshness and staleness. This formed the bustling scene of Tangjiawan.</p>
<p>On the edges of the street, piles of socks, piles of remnant fabrics, piles of undershirts… the voices shouting "special deals" were loud and resonant, attracting workers in short jackets, young women, and some honest folks looking for a bargain. One copper coin for a pair of silk-like socks, three copper coins for a foot of indanthrene blue fabric, three silver dollars for three linen undershirts. Many people looked, but few bought. Large-scale "foreign cloth shops" also put up signs saying "Buy one get two free." Electric fans [whirred, whirred], and the foreign signs and drums at the windows of the buildings mingled with the noise of the market, creating a chaotic din.</p>
<p>A strange cry, and the sesame ball in the child's hand was knocked to the ground. The Annamese man's face was full of veins and tough muscles. "Little devil, you Chinese scum…" A blow to the back of the head. The yellow and oily sesame ball was crushed under the Dunlop tire of a truck. Oh, the investment, the investment, the peddler's blood and tears…</p>
<p>Things like this happen too often; they are not unusual.</p>
<p>In the "simple canteen," there were some honest diners sighing and discussing "rent, charges, the shrewdness of passengers…" These were all rickshaw pullers. Three copper coins for a bowl of something called "fresh soup," seven copper coins for a bowl of rice. The white porcelain bowls and plates were indeed clean in terms of equipment, but for the rickshaw pullers, this was "not of great importance." Their only requirement was cheap prices. However, there were too few canteens for common people. This point should be praised about Tangjiawan.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Jiangwan Road at Dusk <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The time is not in the morning, not in the daytime, not in the night, but only in the very brief moment of dusk.</p>
<p>The climate is not in the snow-covered winter, not in the hot long summer, nor on windy and rainy days, but on a clear and beautiful day in early summer.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Road is not as bustling as Nanjing Road, nor as mysterious as Sichuan Road, and certainly not as affluent and frivolous as Avenue Joffre. On a flat asphalt road, besides the occasional public bus, there are very few other vehicles. As for pedestrians, besides a few country people carrying shoulder poles, there are no other idlers. As for scenery, besides a few tall Western-style houses, the surrounding area is full of green fields. It is extremely quiet, one might even say a road with a strong rural atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, there are quite a few universities and middle schools on that road. Every evening at dusk, they, both boys and girls, always stroll in twos and threes. Some whistle, humming the latest love songs, some chat quietly, commenting on the good and bad of others, some chew on fruit and peanuts, some ride bicycles, and so on... In addition, there are endless patterns. In short: "They, both boys and girls, are happy, active, free..., just like 'the darlings of heaven'."</p>
<p>Among these happy angels, regardless of boys or girls, those who wear dark glasses and blue gowns are always students known as "moralists." Those in neat Western suits, sprinkled with lots of perfume, are sociable students. Girls wear collared shirts on top and men's-style bloomers on the bottom; boys wear shorts and long socks, sleeves rolled up high, revealing strong muscles. These are the athletes that everyone notices. Those who wear baggy Western suits, keep their hair long, and deliberately put on a romantic attitude, these are sure to be future artists and musicians. There are also all sorts of atypical figures, but I cannot describe them one by one. In short, they are all pacing, talking, laughing, and chewing on this road.</p>
<p>The night gradually deepens, and in their golden halls, in their deep palaces, all the electric lights shine brightly. Then this large group of princes and princesses are swallowed into these large buildings; Jiangwan Road returns to the quiet of just now.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Early Summer on Xujiahui Road <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>A long and wide Xujiahui Road, its lower half is like a disheveled country girl, while its upper half is like a slender urban lady.</p>
<p>Because I admire the urban lady, I moved house a month ago—from its lower half to its upper half—right to the most charming and beautiful section. The houses are brand new, the road is asphalt, and along both sides of the road, there are neat rows of trees. Now that summer has come, the green leaves grow bigger every day, fluttering in the early summer breeze, though perhaps they are not fluttering. Perhaps they are smiling faintly at the beginning of summer. Sometimes—morning, noon, evening—a few birds chirp on the branches, as if complaining on my behalf. The worries in my heart are all taken out by them like a young woman reeling silk, and they also send me some fresh, happy, and sweet things in return. Indeed, the green leaves have been sun-dried into many bright eyes, and those bright eyes reflect thousands of silver rays, making me feel particularly happy.</p>
<p>As evening approaches, the sun hides away. At this time, I always go out and stroll alone on the road, seeing unfamiliar men or women covered by the green shade above, coming and going, a little busy like ants. However, if they leave, I let them go; if they come, I let them come. It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>After a while, the taste of dusk suddenly becomes thinner and fainter. The black night invades the whole world, and naturally this corner, this small corner—the most charming and beautiful section of Xujiahui Road—becomes dark in the same way. The street lights far and near, little by little, emit a faint light!</p>
<p>On the road, on Xujiahui Road, the pedestrians slowly become scarce, surrounded by silence. At this time, the early summer breeze, carrying the scent of early summer, blows in gusts, sending me all the way home, and I gently close the door.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Visiting the Lida Academy Chicken Farm <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of our country's rural villages, although due to natural disasters, man-made calamities, and the devastation of heavy oppression and exploitation, the lack of development of rural side businesses is also a major reason. Therefore, I feel that if we want to save the rural villages, in addition to improving various other constructions, promoting rural side businesses is indeed an urgent task.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Jiangwan to visit the Lida Chicken Farm, which was founded by the Lida Academy. It has quite a long history, and the farm was once destroyed by shelling during the January 28th Incident. They have made considerable contributions to agricultural and pastoral undertakings. In addition to this chicken farm, there is also an Art-Appreciation Farm and a Rural Service Department in Nanxiang, and there are also bee farms in Songjiang and Jiaxing. The academy also produces many books and equipment related to agriculture and animal husbandry.</p>
<p>The chicken farm is located on Lida Road in Jiangwan and occupies a large area. In addition to more than ten tall chicken coops, the farm is also covered with various fruit trees, purple clover, vegetables, etc. The purple clover is for bees to collect nectar, and the vegetables are feed for the chickens. There are currently more than 300 breeder chickens, including the Italian breeds "Leghorn," "Rhode Island Red," the American breed "Barred Rock," the Turkish breed "Tiger Chicken," and mixed breeds. As for Chinese chickens, there is only the Xiaoshan chicken breed.</p>
<p>Leghorns are pure white, and these chickens are considered the best among chickens. The hens weigh about five or six pounds each and lay eggs very diligently, averaging about 300 eggs per year, and can lay for six years. The roosters weigh seven or eight pounds and can mate with more than ten hens at the same time and can be used for five or six years, so breeders should prefer the Leghorn breed. However, although Leghorns are good chickens, they are prone to disease, so it is best to raise "mixed" breeds—which are the offspring of Leghorn hens and Xiaoshan hens. However, the first generation of this breed seems to have some differences; it is not until the third generation that its color and eggs are the same as Leghorn, and its physique is as healthy as Xiaoshan chickens.</p>
<p>After visiting each adult chicken coop, we went to the chick-rearing room. That was a wooden building, taller than the adult chicken coops. It housed hundreds of chicks, raised in four groups: one week, two weeks, three weeks, and eight weeks old. Each group has a nanny heater and a nanny thermometer; the humidity is above 90 degrees. It is managed by people day and night, and there is a statistical table on the wall that can be recorded and checked at any time.</p>
<p>The water containers and feeding charts used here are all specially made, and they have equipment to prevent fouling and fighting among chickens. In terms of feed, the main daily feed is barley, wheat bran, and pearl rice flour, as well as cow bone meal, milk powder, fish meal, meat meal, oyster shell powder, silkworm pupae, etc.; however, green grass and vegetables are also essential daily feed.</p>
<p>Finally, we visited the incubation room. It was not a very large room, with three hot water incubators and one table-top incubator. The hot water incubators can incubate 250 eggs each time, and the table-top incubator can only incubate 50 eggs at a time. All are incubated using scientific methods, and the incubation time takes about three weeks.</p>
<p>It is said that the chicken farm used to have more than a thousand breeder chickens of more than ten breeds. Since it was destroyed by the war, the managers were not responsible, so it has not been able to recover until now. The manager has now been replaced, and it is planned to increase the number to 1,000 this year.</p>
<p>I visited for a full two hours, and was guided and explained to by Mr. Guo, so the impressions I gained were very profound.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Dousha (mung bean) Dumplings from Dongshan <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Three years ago, a Dongting Native Products Company opened on North Zhejiang Road. It is said that they used to fry and sell mung bean dumplings from their hometown. However, when I heard this news and went there with my grandmother to taste these mung bean dumplings with the flavor of our hometown, it was very unfortunate that the company had already closed down.</p>
<p>On the more bustling streets of my hometown, you could always see such a steamy mung bean dumpling stall selling fried dumplings. The stall owner was always an old woman or a young woman. On one side, there was a small yellow clay stove, and on the other side, there was a small stone mill. When there were no customers, they would sit by the stall and cut "paper money". When there were customers, they would scoop out half a spoonful at a time of mung beans that had been soaked in water to remove the skin and slowly grind them into a bowl of flour, and then fry them in that flat-bottomed pot.</p>
<p>Mung bean dumplings are regarded as a precious snack. When guests come, in addition to serving a cup of Biluochun tea, you would go to the street to fry a plate of mung bean dumplings to treat the guests. For example, if you are going on a long trip tomorrow, your relatives will also send you a "yellow basket" of dried mung bean dumplings for the journey. If you are idle at home and have nothing to do, you can come to the street alone, have a glass of white liquor, and then fry a plate of mung bean dumplings, sitting half on the stall and chatting idly with the stall owner. Fortunately, it doesn't cost much money; a small dumpling is two copper coins, and a dumpling with egg is only ten or so coins.</p>
<p>I really love eating mung bean dumplings, especially fried with egg. I remember when I was a child, I would secretly take eggs from the egg bucket at home and go to the street to fry dumplings to eat. When my mother discovered that there were fewer eggs, she knew for sure that I had taken them to fry dumplings, and I would be scolded and beaten. It has been many years since I have eaten mung bean dumplings. It was during the time when it was my family's turn to go back to our hometown to sweep the ancestral tombs, which was a full four years ago.</p>

<p>Chapter Two: Fragrant Grass First Entrusts Human Hearts to Delicate Ripples; Small Pavilion's Bright Moonlight Night Warmly Welcomes Initial Dreams</p>
<p>Menglan did not expect to meet him here. For a moment, she was undecided, and had no choice but to lower her head and hide behind a willow tree. Zhang Litian said, "The flowers I gave you have no other meaning. Because you have collected all the novels I have written in various magazines, you are truly my confidante. I know very well that you are a young woman oppressed by old-fashioned etiquette. I sympathize with you. But that doesn't matter. Isn't this a republic? We can stand up and pursue our freedom." Menglan wanted to reply to him with a few words, but she could not escape the common behavior of girls, and blushed and lowered her head, unable to speak no matter what. But then she heard Zhang Litian sigh and say, "It is really difficult to find a confidant in life!" Menglan heard these words clearly expressing his disappointment. So she struggled to say one sentence: "Do you think I am not your confidante? I have read almost every article you have published." As she spoke, she looked outside but could not see Zhang Litian. When she turned out from behind the tree, she saw him holding the apricot flowers behind his back, walking leisurely to a pavilion on top of a mountain. That pavilion was clearly one on Yuhuatai, and she forgot all reason and chased after him. However, when she reached the pavilion, there was no one there. Looking around, the sky was vast, and the wind blew whistling on her, ruffling her clothes. Anxious, she tried to hold down her skirt. But the wind was blowing so hard, she couldn't hold it down no matter what. Anxious in her heart, she opened her eyes. Where were the willow trees? Where was Yuhuatai? It turned out it was a dream. Earlier, she had been greedy for the moonlight, and the windows had not been closed. The wind came straight to the bed, and so it ruffled her clothes. She sat up, rubbed her eyes, and saw only the moon, as big as a plate, hanging in the blue sky. In the sky, besides two or three big stars, accompanying the moon, there was not a single cloud. She went to the window and looked out. The roofs of other people's houses were all silent under the moonlight. The willow tree in her dream had a layer of green light and swayed gently in mid-air, as if saying, "Girl, I saw you dreaming." Looking up again, the sky seemed brighter. The moon was as small as a silver coin, and outside the building was a cold light, slightly tinged with smoke. It connected with the vague buildings in the distance. There were no lights inside the building, and the moonlight shone on the floorboards, painting a square of silver lacquer. The light reflected on the books on the bookshelf, the flowers in the vase, and even the bedding on the bed, adding a kind of secluded charm. She did not hear human voices, but only the rustling of the banana trees in the courtyard downstairs as they were swayed by the wind. Looking down at the courtyard, the shadows of the trees were dark, looking like a dreamscape. A person with a heart full of troubles, having just come out of a dream, cannot help but be stunned.

<h3 id="e172">Stomach Pain and Leukorrhea Cured Simultaneously <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— (Letter from Zhu Changzhi of Xuzhou)</p>
<p>Dear Editor, This is a report of my experiment on medicine. Please publish it in your esteemed publication for the benefit of others suffering from the same diseases. I hope you will agree. The facts are as follows. My wife is over thirty years old. She was very healthy in her youth. But after ten years of marriage and several pregnancies, her health deteriorated. And she developed a stomach pain problem. For several years, this problem would occur dozens of times a year. It was really unbearable. I don't know how she contracted this problem. Medicine didn't help. Starting last year, I don't know if it was because of physical weakness or some other reason, she also developed severe leukorrhea for no reason. At first, we thought it was temporary, but after several months, it was still the same. How could a frail woman endure such torment of disease? We visited several doctors and sought medicine in many places. Finally, through the introduction of a friend, we purchased two boxes of "Wei Bi Ling" powder, as well as one box each of internal and external leukorrhea medicine from the Shanghai Tongren Western Pharmacy. She took the medicine one after another. In just a few days, not only was the newly developed leukorrhea cured, but the chronic stomach pain that had plagued her for years was also completely cured. This effective medicine is really rare and worth recommending. I dare to record the experience to make a truthful report.</p>

<p>— Respectfully,</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I read a news article in the newspaper stating that students in Beiping were preparing for a demonstration. I couldn't help but feel saddened, so I wrote a piece titled "Thoughts on the Student Demonstration Movement in Beiping." After writing the title, I wanted to start writing the article, but difficult questions flooded my mind. If I supported this action, not only could I not, but I also wouldn't be able to. Please forgive the readers for the reasons why I cannot and should not, as I will not explicitly state them. If I opposed this action, it would naturally displease the general readership, who would think that at this point, opposing such actions would mean my blood was too cold.</p>
<p>However, the title had already been written, and the article had to be done. So, I decided on my intention, turned my pen, and wrote down the words from the day before. Let me restate the meaning of this article! My patriotic feelings, please forgive my presumptuousness, dare not lag behind others, to borrow the words of fashionable people. Compared to the patriotic students, they are even more serious. However, I ask myself, the country is impossible to love, and there is no way to love it, so I have diluted my patriotic feelings and instead gone to love the students. Furthermore, seeing or thinking about the forms of past patriotic movements, each one was more tragic than the last, and each one's effectiveness decreased each time. Moreover, what kind of Beiping and Tianjin are they now? Under the oppression of two forces, I fear there is no room to breathe. Is there even a place for you to demonstrate? So, unknowingly, I added the words "unnecessary" to the title and the words "respectfully inform" above the title. The words "thoughts" also had to be declared cancelled.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after this article was published, I received two letters from Mr. "Jin" and Mr. "Jia Zai," both criticizing me for holding improper views and absurd wording. The most absurd passage in my writing, I will now examine myself and confess my sins to Mr. "Jin" and Mr. "Jia Zai."</p>
<p>It is said, "The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual." The heart of patriotism is shared by all. Precisely because the heart of patriotism is shared by all, students do not need to demonstrate alone. If we speak of responsibility, then the government's responsibility is, after all, a hundred or a thousand times heavier than that of students. Therefore, the government's patriotic heart should also be a hundred or a thousand times greater than that of ordinary people. Why should students seek trouble for themselves and do this meddlesome thing?</p>
<p>I knew this passage was absurd when I wrote it. After Mr. "Jin" and Mr. "Jia Zai" raised questions, I reread it and felt it was even more absurd.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is just a small section of the newspaper. If what I said is right, no one will believe it or act upon it. If what I said is wrong, everyone will just laugh it off. Please don't take it too seriously. As for the words "cynical remarks" in my article, they come from here. The so-called cynical remarks are irresponsible remarks and worthless remarks. That is all I meant.</p>
<p>However, if viewed or interpreted from another perspective, the location of responsibility is even clearer. I don't need to add anything unnecessary or repeat myself now.</p>

<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel scared: A whole year, since I left home. Looking back at this not-so-short road, it really makes my timid heart tremble.</p>
<p>Every day, when I'm like a smoked-out cigarette, thrown onto the bed by exhaustion, the remaining fire in my heart still burns. I want to read a book, take the magazine that a well-meaning friend sent</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>with a "please criticize" note, and hope to get some comfort. But, when I see the third line, my eyes involuntarily close, and the hand holding the book is as soft and powerless as cotton. The book falls heavily beside the pillow. Alright, I'll just relax for now, resting a bit is not too late. A person who works all day really needs to rest, and I work with both my mind and body, so I really should rest well. But, I can't just go to sleep, I want to close my eyes for a bit and read later.</p>
<p>The sound of a car horn wakes me up.</p>
<p>I'm still lying in bed, the book under my head. I have no strength in my body at all, I wonder if death is just a little more powerless than this.</p>
<p>The car has passed: carrying the lonely wind of the night towards the distance.</p>
<p>The alley is quiet, without a sound; is everything dead? No, the policeman's leather shoes are ringing: Kang, Kang,... But, what's contained in this sound isn't anything beautiful, but disturbing the quiet that others desperately need. Such a monotonous and irritating sound!</p>
<p>I lie in bed, looking at the light, it's lonely and timidly shining. Outside is the dark air, and cold air occasionally blows in, the light flickering uncertainly. I think of the mourning hall after a person dies: that gloomy and mysterious room... I also think of that friend who works as a gatekeeper, he's already forty years old, half of these forty years he spent traveling, and crossed a mountain from the Songhua River to a new country; he works as a gatekeeper in a small port full of exotic customs near the Songhua River. At that time, he was poor of course, and every night in the deep hours, he always strummed his year-round companion: that lovely "guitar"! Singing newly learned verses with a sentimental and passionate tone. He's a poet, a poet entranced by the wandering life...</p>
<p>The gatekeeper in our alley is a Shandong person. Really, whether in speaking or doing things, I haven't had any good feelings.</p>
<p>Just listen to his monotonous and irritating sound: Kang, Kang,...</p>
<p>I want to prop myself up to close the window, firstly to block the wind, and mainly to isolate this sound.</p>
<p>I hope no one will disturb me, and let me properly recall this past year of life. But I don't want to move at all. My eyes are wandering around the things on the table, on the chair, and the photos and calendar hanging on the walls, they all seem to be intimately keeping me company, and, they seem to be asking me good night, as if they haven't seen me in a long time. I want to raise my hand to caress them, but I don't have the strength. So I unconsciously close my eyes again. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e178">Facts about Face Powder <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Sanhua Company</p>
<p>Q: How to test the quality of face powder?</p>
<p>A: Two tests must be performed. The first is to test the quality of its ingredients to ensure they are refined and harmless. This can only be done in a well-equipped chemical laboratory. The second is to test by oneself. That is, women should test it on their facial skin. Therefore, when choosing face powder, one should pay attention to two major factors: the purity of the quality and its performance on the skin.</p>
<p>Q: How to judge the quality of face powder?</p>
<p>A: All face powder must contain extremely pure ingredients and must be manufactured under skillful management. It must also adhere firmly to the skin, so that it can avoid the invasion of wind, sun, and dust, and be suitable for dry, oily, and generally normal skin. Furthermore, it must be able to remove shine and create a "snowy" beauty on the face.</p>
<p>Q: Why must powder be applied especially to the nose and cheeks?</p>
<p>A: Because these two parts are most prone to sweating. This situation can only be corrected by using a face powder that contains ingredients that absorb sweat and adheres firmly. The face powder refined by the American Sanhua Company contains this special ingredient, so it is most suitable.</p>
<p>Q: Can face powder clog pores?</p>
<p>A: This depends on the type of face powder used. Inferior face powder swells when its powder comes into contact with the skin's natural moisture, so it is especially easy to clog delicate pores when applying this type of inferior face powder in the summer. However, there is absolutely no need to worry about such inferior ingredients when using Sanhua Company's face powder.</p>
<p>Q: Why does face powder often clump on the face?</p>
<p>A: Inferior face powder often has this phenomenon. There are three reasons. First, the powder lacks water-absorbing properties, and sweat turns the face powder into a thin layer of paste. Second, the powder contains starch, which swells when it gets wet with sweat, causing the skin to appear mottled. The third reason is even more common, that is, most face powders cannot adhere firmly to the skin, making them easy to clump. Therefore, it is necessary to reapply powder from time to time, and the layers of powder naturally accumulate unevenly, which is especially true in summer. Usually, using a suitable cream as a powder base can achieve a smooth and even effect.</p>
<p>Q: My daughter is sixteen years old and has beautiful skin. I don't know if using face powder will damage her appearance?</p>
<p>A: This also depends on the type of face powder used. High-quality face powder not only does not harm the skin but can also protect it. This protection is especially needed for young women who want to maintain their youthful beauty.</p>
<p>Q: What is the effect of face powder on dry and oily skin?</p>
<p>A: If the face powder has the quality of adhering firmly, it can protect it. This is because dry skin is most suitable to avoid the invasion of wind, sun, and dust. In other words, it avoids the causes of dryness. As for oily skin, in addition to being protected by a firmly adhering face powder, a special powder quality is also needed to prevent oiliness from causing shine on the skin. The above two characteristics are both effective parts of Sanhua Company's refined face powder.</p>
<p>Q: Before actually trying it on one's own face, is there any way to determine which powder color is most harmonious with one's skin tone?</p>
<p>A: When buying face powder, if you need to determine a certain color and do not want to remove the original makeup, you can apply the powder puff to the upper part of the wrist on the arm to determine it. This test is most likely to allow people to choose the most suitable powder color. However, if the color of the clothing changes, then the powder color used will sometimes also need to be harmonized with the clothing color for coordination.</p>
<p>Q: When should both dark and light powder colors be used together?</p>
<p>A: For example, applying dark-colored face powder to the contours of the face can make it look smaller. If the nose is too large, applying a powder that is darker than other parts of the face can make the nose look smaller. If the face is too narrow, applying light-colored powder to the part where the eyes and nose intersect can correct it. As for those with broad faces, they can apply dark-colored powder along the hairline, which can reduce the degree of broadness.</p>
<p>Q: What is the best way to draw eyebrows?</p>
<p>A: When drawing eyebrows, first remove any powder marks around the eyebrows, then use an eyebrow pencil to draw a thin line, which should be slightly upward and outward, drawing a long stroke. If the natural eyebrows are too short, they should be slightly extended, but the eyebrows should be extended slightly upward, so that the space between the eyes can appear wider.</p>
<p>Q: How can lipstick be used to its fullest potential?</p>
<p>A: A fully exposed oral cavity is the most beautiful. Therefore, the so-called "Cupid's bow" should be fully apparent. Those with thin lips can apply more lipstick to the upper lip to correct it. Those with thick lower lips should move the powder line up a little. When applying lipstick, you should first apply it to the middle and move outward, gradually becoming lighter. If you use Sanhua Company's lipstick, the lips can be more moist, soft, and bright. This is the trend of today's fashion.</p>

<p>Central-Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Changban Slope"</p>
<p>Eternal hero, Zhao Zilong. He charged into battle alone, with his spear. He was willing to risk his life to save the young lord, charging into Cao's camp. The snow-white robe was stained red with blood. Seeing him, his tiger eyes flashed with anger, and his spear pierced wildly. Seeing him, his precious sword waved, his spirit soaring like a rainbow. Riding into the encirclement. The loyal servant was full of courage. Scared, Cao Cao's heart and soul were broken. He inquired as to his name, and sent Cao Hong. He cherished talent and could not bear to harm him. He ordered the entire army to capture him alive as a great achievement. Who knew that while Cao Cao's wish might be fulfilled, cold arrows would be launched from the side. He was all courage. The enemy soldiers were thousands upon thousands surrounding him. He found the ruined well. Seeing the mistress before him, he bowed. Several times he knelt to help her onto the horse. But Lady Mi jumped into the well. Zilong quickly hid Adou, then tied him up securely and placed him close to his chest. Suddenly, two enemy generals rushed over. Zilong drew his spear, mounted his horse, and fought bravely. In an instant, he speared and slashed the brave generals to death. He could only go to Changban Slope to find his lord. A rider sped along, dust blinding his eyes. He heard the drums beating loudly. Suddenly, he saw Zhang Fei standing with his spear. Blocking the general and not letting him pass. Asking him where he was stationed.</p>

<p>Tongle (720) Midnight 1:00 AM to 1:45 AM</p>
<p>Opening "King Xiang of Chu"</p>
<p>Han Xin helped Liu establish great merit. He defeated Xiang Yu, showing his power. Uprooting mountains and wielding cauldrons was useless. Half a lifetime of fame was gone in an instant. Pitifully chased to the Wujiang River. The waves were roaring, no road through. There was not an inch of flat land ahead. And pursuing soldiers behind were very fierce. Concubine Yu had died, and the raven horse had perished. How could I, the lone king, have the face to return to Jiangdong? The soldiers under the tent are loyal. The king has to take your head. A small boat is in the river. If you can cross the Wujiang River. Go to Jiangdong to see your father and elders. Xiang Yu at this time could do nothing. Quickly call a boatman for me. Who knew. The boat was small, ferrying people, not horses. The double pupils of Chu were anxious. Xiang Yu, I ask you. Where are the eight thousand soldiers? Could it be that. Your aura is still as powerful as it was before. King. The fathers and elders of Jiangdong are looking forward to it. Plan to recover the kingdom. Xiang Wang is. The wind and clouds change color. He is furious. Several years of hegemony were like a spring dream. His soaring spirit was entrusted to the east wind. I will not go to Jiangdong today. You. Take my head and claim credit. Suddenly he heard the sound of drums shaking the heavens and the earth. Xiang Yu turned his head and was even angrier. See the smoke and dust rolling, pursuing soldiers arriving</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>. Soldiers like fierce tigers, horses like dragons. Only see. Xiang Yu wields the sword as his first stick. The sword is. Just. Hope to be successful. Establish you as the Empress in Zhaoyang Palace. Who knew that now it would become a dream. Have to. Very heartedly leave you in the river. Han Xin, Han Xin, you. With the ambush of soldiers on all sides. Killing us. Horses dead, people dead, blood dyed red. Zhang Liang, Zhang Liang. You blew away the eight thousand soldiers. I have no face to see Jiangdong. At this moment, King Xiang only wished to die. He drew his sword from his waist. He committed suicide by the Wujiang River, and blood flowed red.</p>

<h3 id="e183">"Ten Thousand Wonders Troupe" and "Removing Evil for the People" <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Two Great Contributions from the Shanghai Grand Theater</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road, in order to cater to the interests of all circles, spared no expense in hiring the Ye Ming Dance Troupe "Ten Thousand Wonders Troupe." From today, all the male and female actors will perform various new programs day and night. The most exciting of these is "King Kong Resurrection," which is the crystallization of the troupe's efforts. It is the first time it will be performed in Shanghai. It is novel, interesting, and deeply meaningful. It cannot be compared to the mediocre songs and dances of today. It is truly creating a new voice in the world of song and dance. Furthermore, it is specially showing the latest Columbia martial arts blockbuster "Removing Evil for the People," starring martial arts star Buck Jones and beautiful actress Helen Mack. It is the first public screening in Shanghai. It is a masterpiece that makes the two outdated films stand out. It is brave, enthusiastic, and filled with superhuman intelligence. The entire film is in an extremely tense state. Famous films and songs and dances are contributed at the same time. It is said to be a new record for the first-run theaters, so the shows have been very crowded for several days.</p>

<p>Yang Xiaozhong's "Three Warriors" script had already been completed, but it is now being adapted into a sound film as a tribute.</p>
<p>The filming of "Go to Nature" is progressing very diligently. The director of the film</p>
<h3 id="e185">Manerwen Tauglas and Zong'er Panderlik Starring in "Elegant Thief" <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Showing at the Great Shanghai</p>
<p>Sun Mu announced recently. Filming will be completed in mid-June. The general idea for the script of "Go to Nature" has been drafted.</p>
<p>One-third of "Crying Remnants of Red" had already been filmed, but recently it was decided to remake the film as a sound film, so the filmed parts were all sacrificed and remade. The film is scheduled to resume work in June. Director Wang Cilong is currently discussing the script with writer Zhu Shilin.</p>
<p>Director Cai Chusheng has been busy with dubbing work for "The Lost Lamb" and only returns late at night.</p>
<p>Hong Jing played a doctor in "Carefree Gentleman." In "A Mother's Song," she is once again practicing medicine. According to Hong, before entering the film industry, she once studied medicine.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu's new work "Red Azalea" is tentatively renamed "Good Son and Good Daughter."</p>
<p>When "A Mother's Song" was filmed the other day, all the Lianhua actors turned out, a gathering of talents, an unprecedented event for Lianhua's filming.</p>
<p>In "Skyline," Shang Guanwu plays the director of an orphanage. Recently, in "A Mother's Song," he plays the director of a home for the elderly. Colleagues therefore call Lao Shang a philanthropist.</p>
<p>Correction Yesterday, the words "Iron-Blooded Mandarin Ducks" in "Showing at the Great Shanghai" were a mistake for "Showing at the Great Light." We hereby make this correction. Film Editorial Department</p>
