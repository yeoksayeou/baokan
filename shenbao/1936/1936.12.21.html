<h3>受傷戰士慰勞記</h3>
<p>— 比德</p>
<p>紅格電圖與百靈廟的兩决大戰爭，蒙偽匪軍雖受偌大之損失，我方抗敵戰士也死傷了不少。死亡的已將尸首運回歸綏，並巳舉行追悼會，受傷的也陸續用軍用汽車送來後方，在後方醫院裏治撩。後方醫院共有三所，都在歸綏市的市區內，計一在梁山街省立第四小學內，一在小東街傳濟醫院內，一在車站左近的第一兵站駱院內，還有慈善機關的公醫院，院內也寄件着一部分的受傷戰士。</p>
<p>連日由各地到歸綏來的慰勞團體，如淸華大學戰區服務團，朝陽學院慰勞團，山東高級中學慰勞團，東北大學慰勞團等，都派有代表到各傷兵醫院去慰問受傷的戰士。記者於十四日的下午，也伴隨北平市學生綏遠抗戰後援會代表葉文琴王警寰二君去梁山街小東街第一兵站醫院裏慰問，並調查受傷戰士的生活情形。</p>
<p>我們先到小東街的傷兵醫院去，由該院的負責人陳君招待，並由陳君帶往各輕重病室進行慰問，首先我們在樓下的病室慰問。北平市學生代表葉君作一簡短的慰問詞，每個受傷的戰士都很集中精神的聽着，每個人的面部都現出感激的神色。有幾倘病重的，都躺在床上，只張着眼睛緊瞧着慰勞的人，在樓下的第二號病室裏，有一個被炸斷了右腿的戰士，當我跟他拍照時，他還呌人把蓋着的被單拉開，暗示我把他的斷腿也拍在照片裏。當時我受了很大的感動，我明白這位斷了腿的英勇的戰士的用意，我明白他不是要以斷腿來顯示他的英勇，而是要用來告訴我們後方的同胞，使後方的同胞們曉得在前綫上有我們的許多偉大的戰士們在爲國家爲民族犧牲他們的腿，他們的臂，甚至於他們的生命。</p>
<p>在這位斷了腿的戰士的鄰床上，還有一位被炸傷了右臂的戰士，他好似沒有半點痛苦的樣子，他的面部發着異樣的光彩，很自然的在答着早巳在那兒的一位慰勞者的發問，離開了這個病室，我們又給領導者帶上樓上，那兒全是輕病的，只有一個損了半爿臉孔的同胞，他是任紅格爾圖的戰役上被敵人的子彈打傷了的，他獨自躺在一個小小的病室裏，顯得非常的寂寞，非常的痛苦似地。我們爭先向他慰問，及至說明要給他拍照時，他還掙扎着要打算坐起來，我們忙着阻止了他，他才安詳的躺着，讓我們把這慘痛的形像收人鏡箱裏，頂可惜的是爲子光綫的不够。冲洗出來的像片都未能完全的美好。</p>
<p>慰問完了之後，我們每人得到一張晋綏勦匪軍受傷士兵的答詞，其中有一段這麼說：「我們認爲唯有拿熱血向敵人酒，才能够爭回國家的人格，與民族的生存，因此我們現在雖然是受了點傷，並不痛苦，精神上反覺得分外安慰，只要傷能略好一點，便　舊上前綫與敵人拼命。」</p>
<p>出了小東街的傷兵醫院，我們又趕去第四小學的傷兵醫院，這裏的院長是少校軍醫允翰章，胖胖的個子，看來是一位挺能幹的中年人，他招待我們在他的寢室裏坐了一會，抽了一口烟，喝了幾杯靑茶，我們問他這裏有若干受傷的戰士，是在那一决的戰役中受傷的，已有多少出了院，他說：「這裏目前只有五十　位受傷戰士，出院的已經十多位了，住在這邊的大部分是攻百靈廟而受傷的，小東街的大多是在紅格爾圖一役中受的傷，」又說：「全婦綏共有二百多個受傷的戰士，」北平市學生代表葉君問他，傷兵醫院裏現在缺乏些什麼，後方民衆應該送些什麼慰勞品或是應用品藥品來。才院長答說：一醫院所需要的是藥棉綁帶等物，但這些東西大多已經很完備，至於餅干　菓等，還是不用送來，因爲受傷的人不一定需要這些東西。一說後就吩咐一個看護士模樣的人去告訴受傷的戰士一聲，說是有代表來慰勞了。過了一會，就帶我們逐個病室去慰問，這邊的病室全是由四小課室改設的，所以也淸潔，也通爽，光綫也比較的充足。不過有一點頗值得我注意的，就是每個受傷的戰士都蓋着一條極其整齊的被子，他們睡在棉被的裏面，把臉面露在外面，臉上都現着不很舒適的樣子。我心裏想尤院長呌看護士先生通知受傷的戰士們，其中必有什麼秘密吧，說不定他强迫每個受傷的戰士都要蓋上這笨重的棉被，不管你需要不需要，自然我希望我這揣想是不對的。如果眞有這植不管受傷戰士的需要與吾而光是爲了外表的整齊，那就太不應該了。這樣只有使得每個受傷的戰士都感覺慰勞團來慰勞他們，是帶給他們痛苦，使他們既要强裝着不目然的安詳，又要受着不願意受的壓制。</p>
<p>從四小的傷兵醫院出來，巳經是下牛四時了。我們備了洋車拉去車站，在省三校裏慰問許多在百靈廟受了傷的王英部下的兵士這些會經爲了一時的利慾的引誘做了一椿最可羞恥的事情後的中國靑平們，都爲了受極優渥的欵待而感激。這些年靑人大多是江浙以及河北河南省的貧窮農人，因受飢餓的驅迫，才走上這條死路。其中有些是商都縣的老百姓，王英拉了他們的馬匹，强迫他們參加戰事，他們才無法而參加的，這些都表示很興奮，說是現在巳離開了虎口，雖然受了點傷，　精神上身體上也已很爲舒適自由了。（十二月十五日）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>時局的曙光</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>本月十二日的西安事變發生以後。全國悲憤的情緒高漲到了極點。同時國際輿論也表示了非常的不安。然而到了最近。險惡的陰霾中間。却漸漸現出曙光來了。第一中央的威信。因討伐令的頒布和全國輿論的響應而愈見增高。第二各省軍人先後通電。表示擁護中央。最近于院長奉命入陝宣慰。馮欽哉等駐陝將領又復通電誓死討。張在這種情勢之下。張學良處境的孤立和窮蹙可想而知。第三蔣委員長的安全和自由。本是國人最所關心的問題。但是自從端納和蔣鼎文到京以後。我們對於安全一點已可確信。而最近宋子文的到陝。又使蔣委員長的脫險增大了可能性。第四全世界的報紙無論其政治立塲如何。一致對蔣委員長表示稱頌和同情。這一種國際輿論。足以增强蔣委員長的聲望。同時也可以促動張學良的覺悟。</p>
<p>從這幾點。我們可知張學良所闖下的滔天大禍。無論如何。是可以在最短期間收拾的了。這一種趨勢不但是全國民意所决定。也是國際局勢所决定的。爲什麽呢。因爲西安事變包含着中國最高軍政領袖的安危問題。顯然有着世界的意義。今日的中國正在向自力更生的統一的路上走如果因蔣委員長的不安全。而减殺中國統一禦侮的力量。當然是關心世界和平的各國所疾首痛心的。英國保守黨的機關報倫敦太晤士指斥這次事變說「這是一種大胆的陰謀的『舞台變亂戲』……如果中央政府不能迅速將此事解决。則前途的變化不測。殊非我們所敢臆測。」就是張學良片面地認爲知己的蘇聯。對於西安事變也表示着極大的反感。日前的莫斯科眞理報說「張學良的叛變證明着他是日本帝國主義的工具。」前天蘇聯大使館代辦司皮禮瓦尼克又到外部謁見張外長。表明蘇聯政府對於西安事變的態度說是「蘇聯政府判定張學良的行動徒足以破壞中國統一。减少中國力量」英蘇兩國的態度如此。其他的國家。除了有侵略野心的以外。態度也如此。他們所以痛惡張學良的舉動。就因爲這是破壞中國的統一和安定的。在今日的世界。中國還是很大的維持和平的力量。中國國民爲要保障民族的生存。固然需要着統一和安定。世界的多數國家爲要維持世界的和平。也要求着中國的統一和安定。在這樣的時代。任何破壞中國的統一和安定的舉動當然是都非失敗不可的。</p>

<h3>台灣的透視</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>閩省政界及銀行界組織之台灣考察團，一行共十一人，於本月一日出發，十四日返厦，茲承參加該團赴台考察之中南銀行行長章叔淳君以所撰「台灣的透視」一文見惠，文中紀述，對於台灣一切情况，極為精密，其所觀察亦極深刻，爰錄於次。</p>
<p>我這次赴台灣，來去只有十四天功夫，在這短短的遊程中，對於這個我國舊屬而現在完全在日人管理下之台灣，也曾經作了一番各方面的觀察，所以本篇主要的意思，便是說明台灣的內容·物產·以及日本人之如何經營台灣，希望引起護者對牠的認識與深切的注意，並請讀者原諒，勿責筆者是代日本人宣傳，則幸甚矣。</p>
<p>此次我赴台灣的動機，說起來却在一年之前了，那時曾有人邀我去過，我則因事不能分身，所以沒有去，後來看到了這位朋友在台灣作的日記，內容記載得很詳細，不過對於台灣的種種，很多不滿之辭，這大概是因為各人觀點不盡相同，所以觀察的結果，也就不能一致，但因此反更引起了我遊台的興趣，最近本市又有赴台考察團體，我也就毅然的參加了。</p>
<p>在我們起程前，日方曾調查我們一行中各個人的責任地位，和要考察的東西，以便編定日程，從這些細微的地方，也可看出日本人之處處愼密，絕不似我國人之雍容大度，凡事不以為意的，我們一行人到台登岸的時候，雖比一般旅客優異了些，但也還是受了最難看的面孔日本警察之相當嚴格的檢查。</p>
<p>我們任未談到台灣內容以前，首先要知道牠的歷史上的沿革，我國人最初赴台灣，遠在唐朝，其後曾被西班牙荷蘭兩國先後佔領，在淸朝初年，便完全成為中國的版圖，設立巡撫，直到甲午中日戰爭，我國戰敗，方割讓給日本的，從事實上來講，我國如果再想收復的確不是一件容易的事了。</p>
<p>台灣的人口，據最近統計，共有五百萬，未入台灣籍的華僑約五萬人，日人約有三十餘萬，已歸化的土番的十三萬，未歸化的生番約有三十萬，日本是不肯說的，此外差不多都是福建漳泉厦籍，不得已而入了台灣籍的人，日人的治理台灣，完全是用一種低壓强制手段，造成一種無知無識的人民，來供他利用與驅策，尤可痛心的，是到了台灣與台籍人民談到台灣與福建的關係，他們都茫然了，甚至於有大部份人都不知道厦門與台灣，是同方言的，這便是日本人奴隸教育的成功。</p>
<p>台灣的生番種族，約有七八種，這種土番，與斐列濱土人同種，或是從那兒來的，也未可知，本來都住在海邊一帶，後來因為我國人口增加，海邊無法生存，才退居深山中，現在日本人對他們完全用一種教育犬馬的方法，來訓練他們，例如見了日本人，都要鞠躬致敬，教之穿衣工作，改其習慣，生死嫁娶，探望親友，都要報告，武器除刀箭外，槍是絕對不能有的，現在日人為便利管理計，又想把他們從深山中引下來，其未歸化之生番，完全封鎖，並且每年尚山裏推進五里，照這樣下去，總有全部撲滅的一天。</p>
<p>除了生番之外，還有便是我國入籍的台民，日本對於他們，也是用了相同的策略來奴化他，台灣最初沒有大學，台民受教育的機會，祇能到中學為止，現在雖然有了一所大學，但牠的內容，也祇注意農林醫事等，台民的職業，除了農民與勞工及少數充當警察之外，任公務員的，可說是絕對沒有，也沒有當兵的義務，就是任商業機關中高級職員的，也很少見的，台人從事自由職業，只有律師醫生之類。</p>
<p>日本警察之細微凶狠，是很有名的，在台灣的日本警察，當然不能例外，他一切的一切，無一件不是干涉主義，不做事固然要干涉，做事不勤勞也要干涉，每日花錢太多，也要干涉，其他更可想而知了，台灣治安及生產增加，說是日本警察之功，誰曰不宜。</p>
<p>台灣的治安，非常良好，可以說是路不拾遺，原因是民間絕對沒有槍枝軍械，而且出人台灣，都要有護照，檢查得也很嚴，盜賊自然地漸漸絕跡了，本來中日兩國人民往來不要護照，但到台灣是例外，可見日本人是對鎖台灣，旣不願我國人去，亦不願台民出來，歐美方面人也很少，聽說只台北有美國及英國領事，少數傳教的西人外，只有幾個茶商，住在台北。</p>
<p>臺灣的交通，初到臺灣的人，練覺得他的路政並不好，甚至於還不如厦門，但我們拋關表面不談，而從他的內質及效力各方面來觀察，便可以知道他完全為增進生產及便利運輸為目的，不注重形式，臺灣城市與鄉村之間，差不多都設有輕便鐵路，人民可以自由使用，就是間或沒有輕便鐵路的地方，也都有着寬綽的道路，通達各處，以供給牛車及橡皮車之行駛，所以農產亦隨時可以從田野中送到車站或都市去。</p>
<p>臺灣的農產品，在日本人的指揮興策進之下，出品數量，是很足駭人的，據調查臺灣的米，年產二萬一千萬担，糖二萬五千六百萬担，茶可分三種，烏龍茶五百萬磅，黑茶八百萬磅，靑茶七百五十萬担，合計幾佔全世界產量之半數，鹽與茶幾乎將我國市塲摧殘殆盡，香蕉為七百萬噸，草帽一千五百萬頂，菠蘿三百萬打，酒產銷七百萬元，酒精亦七百萬元，此外如樟腦年亦產達七百萬磅，總收量每年値二十二萬萬元，日本人對於各種農產品，都設有試騐塲，聘請多數專家研究改善，對於糖的一項，試騐得最有成績，例如對於糖的產生種類害蟲病原交配等，都研究得非常精細，然後通知　間來進行改善，現在已成功的，有斐列濱爪哇等種，因為恐怕別國人起來仿效他，所以對於種籽是絕對禁止出賣。</p>
<p>臺灣的漁業，也很發達，建有極大的冷藏庫和漁市塲，打魚的範圍很廣，差不多已遠到了南洋斐列濱海面一帶，漁市塲每天用廣播報告遠出海外各漁船的海上氣象等消息，並放送音樂新聞，供海外漁人收聽，打來的魚，便分門別類的冷藏起來，運銷到中國日本內地，和南洋歐洲各處。</p>
<p>此外如鹽的產量也很大，除了供給民食之外，並作為工藝的原料，所以時時感覺不够用，要向我國買鹽。</p>
<p>日人最近在高雄辦了一個鋁廠，資本一千萬元，大約明年四月，就可有出品，所需原料，是從荷屬南洋一個島上用船裝來，聘用一德國工程師，日薪三百元，不可謂不鉅，不過日本人很善於利用外人，旣能呌他展其所長，又不至於大權旁落。</p>
<p>現在臺灣由政府專賣的東西有五種，就是烟·酒·樟腦·鹽·雅片，雅片都是來是波斯，呌做紅土，所含嗎啡成分很少，經過製造成烟膏，放過一年後，再行出賣，此五種專賣，年約五千萬元。</p>
<p>臺灣最大事業有三，（一）臺南州　南大圳組合，是就依各山形勢將低凹處築設堤壩，將水蓄住，用來灌溉田畝，並再將滵海之田鹹實洗去，以供種植，據說築堤等費五千四百萬元，可以灌溉四十五萬甲，（每甲約二十五畝）每年收水費約一百五十萬元，因此增加的生產二年有四千寓元之鉅，（二）新竹州日月潭水電廠，完全用水力可以供給全臺灣之用，有十萬基羅瓦特電力，（三）便是上節所說的漁業，有水產試騐塲多處，專門研究，將研究結果，呌漁民改良，此外在每地都有一商品陳列館，對於商業的運銷，也有很大效能。</p>
<p>總之，日本人佔有臺灣一共四十三年，經營是費了絕大的心力，但他的目的，祇是在於役用五百萬臺民的血汗得來的生產，充實他的力量，滿足其向世界優略的野心，所以我們應當在談到臺灣的時候，大家要努力增加生產而圖自强，並且要學他的增加生產的方法，特別是福建省一切氣候等，都與臺灣相同的，此福建實　，屢次派人到臺考察之眞意也</p>

<h3>孫科抵滬談　陜變解决甚易　如以軍事力量不出二三星期　張决不敢有損蔣院長之膚髪</h3>
<p>立法院院長孫科、中委王寵惠·及立委傳秉常·吳經熊·四氏、前晚十一時，聯袂乘坐夜車、離京來滬、昨晨六時五十分抵眞如下車、當卽分返私邸休息、孫院長旋於上午十時半許、在哥倫比亞路私邸、接見新聞記者、發表關於西安事變之重要談話如下、</p>
<p>西安事變　解决殊易</p>
<p>據孫院長談、蔣院長迄十九日晚止，尚未出險、張學良如以此作為緩兵之計、徒見心勞日拙而已、蓋因討逆部隊、刻仍依照預定之計劃前進也、蔣院長於三數日內、或能出險、否則卽以軍事之力量解决、則不出二三星期、叛軍亦可全部解决、至於蔣院長之安全、决無問題、張學良之劫持蔣院長、意在「挾天子以令諸侯、」而抉不敢有損蔣院長之膚髮也、</p>
<p>絕對不談　政治問題</p>
<p>中央目前對於叛逆、絕對不談任何政治問題、宋子文氏之飛陝、純以私人之資格、探視蔣院長、並訪晤張學良、本人確曾接到張學良之來電、歡迎赴陝一行、卽中樞其他各要人、均曾接到同樣之電報、在張學良之夢想中、希望中樞各要人、均為渠之俘虜、於此實僅足以暴露張學良之幼雅與想蠢而已、各省市當局、均絕對擁護中央、紛請討伐叛逆、卽全國人民、亦莫不如是也、</p>
<p>稱兵作亂　匪性表現</p>
<p>張學良此次叛變、傳以蘇聯為背景、實非確詞、至於與中國共匪有何聯絡、則尚無所聞、張學良之以抗日為口號、更屬可笑、張學良旣失東四省土地於前、而復於前綫抗戰緊張之時、劫持統帥，拘禁前綫指揮長官、稱兵作叛、搗亂後方、而曰抗日、其誰信諸、張學良與楊虎城之叛變、僅足以表現渠等之「匪性」而己、在中國四萬萬同胞尚未絕滅之前、張學良等實不配以言抗日也、</p>
<p>綏遠前方　並不影響</p>
<p>綏遠前方、目前並無大戰、匪僞部隊、紛紛反正、至於綏遠之剿匪軍事、並不受西安事變之影饗、仍照原定、計劃進行、本人此來在滬、稍作勾留、預定今晚（二十一日）仍乘夜車返京云、</p>
<h3>現在滬市　曾任字林報西安訪員某氏　暢談陜變前因後果　東北軍橫暴張學良無能　不久將送蔣委員長出險</h3>
<p>字林報云、據近在西安任訪員之某氏刻寓滬埠、昨據聲稱、凡上年曾寓西安者、對於近今西安之事變、無一為之驚愕、蓋西安城中茶館酒肆之談論東北軍將在陝省成立一獨立治區、如九一八前之東三省然、幾令人聞之熟矣、則可稱殊乏機敏之智也、東北軍紀律蕩然、恣睢性成、對於居民、任意虐待、故自入陝以來、陝民無不疾首蹙額、東北軍之視陝省、一若征服之土地然、其入陝名為勦共、然一言勦匪二字、西安居民、無一為之掩口葫蘆，蓋若輩不特從未與匪共開戰、甚至張學良與匪共已有默契、此事已成公開之秘密、至於矢忠中央政府一語、在東北軍中從未聞之也、本年五月、兩粤變起時、若輩於談吐之間、不時流露贊助歡忭之情緒、記者偶發與若輩相反之意見、若輩乃勉强敷衍、謂統一之中國、仍發此種爭鬥、殊屬不幸云、記者猶憶某晚、在中國旅行社新式旅館大禮堂赴宴時、適鄰座長案有東北軍高級軍官若干人設宴、為個中之一祝壽、人人痛飲、大有醉意、於是依次致詞、對於其頭袖「少帥」、（時不在座）東北軍之團結與榮績、及各人之勇行德性稱揚備至、但無一言涉及中央政府與總司令、就若輩之言論察之、其心目中實無總司令其人也、若干報紙近曾載述西安之大進步、以表示張學良之有遠大計劃、此誠毫無意識、西安人民對張、從未發一感謝之詞、西安近年來之進步、純為中央政府之工作、而由省主席邵力子指導實行者、與張學良毫無關係、張學良費於西安之金錢、厥為擴張拳亂時西太后出奔至陝時所寓之故宮、張氏現據以為其司令部、內駐辦事員數百人、小張在東北失地辱國後、而仍受國人若是注意者、其唯一理由、殆因彼日人頭腦不淸、重視張氏而與作死對頭所致、夫張氏毫無使日人有一息不安之能力、而乃若是重視之、亦使人莫明其故、惟日人旣圖去之、華人當然顧與相反而尊之、因是張氏對於國家雖無寸功、仍得為一全國無能之英雄、假使日人早置張氏於度外、就日人立塲言、張氏實不値一顧、則張學良今日必將以一平民隱居大連或他處日租界矣、吾人就張氏之性格論、不得不認張氏實非此次事變之主腦、殆為其部下、較張返粗野之土匪出身將頒數人迫而出此、第此種見解尚待後事以證明之也、</p>
<p>東北軍今日在陝省之實力、共有幾何、傳者不一其詞、有謂多至二十萬人者、有謂少至三萬人者、就記者所知、其總數在十萬人以上、散居陝北各縣、此外楊虎城尚有衆三五萬人、就戰鬥力言、張楊之軍、實不堪一擊、若輩從未經過正當之戰役、甚至未與匪一戰、十九路軍殆為中國勁旅之一、然前年在閩舉事時、中央政府之飛機不出兩星期、已使之喪亡不能成軍、今以治陝西之叛軍、而復有陸軍會師進勦、彼跳醜小梁不難於一星期內戡平之、况彼叛軍首領、皆屬懦夫、故料若輩於完全被團而無逃生之路之日、必將蔣委員長安全送出、以自全其皮骨也、</p>

<p>正在前綫冒寒血戰、和全國熱烈援助民族抗戰的問候、突然張學良刦持我們最高的革命領袖蔣委員長、在西安叛變了、這個消息、使許多在前方戰塲上的將士們、威覺無限的悲憤、使全國人民、無論老幼男女、尤其是一般靑年們、流下許多慷慨激昂的熱淚、</p>
<p>我們是國家民族一份子、有「國家興亡匹夫有責」的責任、早就把頭顱和熱血、貢獻給國家民族了、貢獻給復興民族完成統一的負責的領袖蔣委員長了、當此逆賊禍國、大　臨頭的日子、自然要和我們許多有良心血性的靑年戰士、結成一個鐵血的團體、共赴國難、我們這個鐵血團體份子、是從學校裏·工廠裏·農村裏·負着國家實際生產工作、與將來國命所託的靑年勞工而結成的、</p>
<p>為了我們國家和民族、為了堅决地擁護頒袖、完成複興民族的偉大工作、不惜犧牲工課和工作、更不惜犧牲個人的生命、誓以赴湯蹈火的决心、頭可斷、血可流、我們的領袖不可不迎護回京、以主持救國岡存的大計、</p>
<p>用我們的犧牲、去挽回國家的命運、營救頒袖的厄難、這是我們最神聖、最光明的事業、</p>
<p>張學良是什麼一個無聊賴、無廉恥的人呀、他的父親被敵人殺害、不思為父報仇、又於一夕之中、甜歌醉舞地、斷送了東北三省數千里的土地、三千數百萬之人民、這樣的國仇父仇集於一身的牠、如果稍有血氣良心、應該早日自殺、以謝國人、乃竟勾結土匪、刦持統帥、破壞已完成的全國統一、於私何以對領袖深厚的恩德、幷何以對其亡父幽恨、於公又何以對民族國家刦持我們的領袖、便是斷送我們國家民族的生命、因為領袖是我們民族國家的託命者、我們知道、環視我們的敵人、最懼怕我們的是誰、就是我們的蔣委員長、他的崇高偉大人格、他的犧牲奮鬥的歷史、他的堅苦卓絕的精神、是形成了中國唯一的領袖、不但全國人民所公認、卽國際上也是同樣公認的、「九一八」以來、國勢如何因苦艱難、國際環境如何險惡、端賴我們的領袖、從艱難顛墜中、打出一條復興民族的道路、現在我們正要向着這條道路前進、張學良却突然在這條道路上叛變了、將使我們的國家、重陷於死亡的途徑、這種禍國的國賊、實在是五千年歷史上所沒有的、</p>
<p>張學良勾結赤匪、推翻政府、這種野心、是澈底的出賣民族、現在要救中國、只有先使中華民族得到獨立與解放、這是誰都知道的、白色敵人、固然是要減亡我們的民族、赤色的敵人、又何嘗不是想滅亡我們的民族呢、西班牙的慘禍、血跡殷殷的陳列在我們的眼前、張學良何嘗不知道、但是他竟為了個人的私慾、軍閥野心的復萌、不惜以國家民族、供其個人的犧牲、不惜以四萬萬全國的同胞、供其犧牲、不惜以五千年歷史的中華民族、供其犧牲、這樣賣國的國賊、是國家民族的罪人、是全國民族的公敵、</p>
<p>中國統一局面、得有今日的完成、眞不知犧牲了多少革命的先烈、更不知耗費了多少物力和財力、現在正集中全國的力量、於政府一定的國策之下、作救國圖存的根本事業、綏遠之戰、可謂國策的初步、開始抗戰以來、節節勝利、百靈願克復了、大廟子也克復了、領袖告訴我們、克服百靈廟、是復興民族的起點、張學良却在這個復興民族的推進中來叛變、給敵人以反攻的大好機會、張學良不但是做了赤色敵人的漢奸、而且做了白色敵人的漢奸、現在政府明令討伐了、我們相信政府與全國人民的力量、足以消滅張逆而有餘、而現在我們也準備為國赴難了、只要是我們的領袖所在的地方、無論是火山、無論是地獄、我們準備了頭顱和熱血、迎護我們的領袖回京、來領導我們做剿匪抗敵的工作、繼續中華民族復興的事業、謹此宣言、</p>

<h3>上海之電器製造業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之四十）</p>
<p>一·分類及沿革</p>
<p>我國之利用電氣以供日常生活所需，迄今尚不過三十餘年之歷史，惟利用電氣所需之電器材料，初皆全賴外洋輸入，迨至近十餘年來，國人始漸能仿造一部份。按電器村料種類繁多，且日在发明增進之中（如無綫電機，霓虹燈管之類，皆為較晚之新發明，為初時所不常見者。）大別之，可分為下列六項：一、電池電筒，主要用以蓄電；二、燈用電料，如電燈泡，皮花線之類，三、家用電器，如電扇，電爐，電熨斗，電鍋灶之類，四、電動機與變壓器，五、無綫電用器，六、霓虹燈材料。七開六項，不論在製造上或功效上，均能各自成系。第四項因製造過程較為繁複，上海經營者甚少，第五項目下幾全為舶來品，第六項尚為一新興事業，本文皆不備載。至前三項，本埠各電器製造廠從事生產者甚夥，尤以電燈泡，電池兩項為甚，今將其沿革分誌於後：</p>
<p>、電池電筒製造業——民國元年，國華電池廠成立於閘北北虬江路，專門製造各種乾電瓶，嗣後交通部又委之代辦大批電池，幷着其設廠於浦東，除乾電池外，又兼造蓄電池，是為本埠該業之始祖。民九有中國蓄電池廠，民　以後，又有譯泮，光華，匯明行廠繼起，迄今大小電池廠已達二十家左右，市上所售之乾電池幾全為國貨。至手電筒類多兼營製造專門製造者規模亦極狹小，資本不過教千元而已。（未完）</p>

<h3>蠶絲業界應有之動向</h3>
<p>— 王天予</p>
<p>一　緒言</p>
<p>跟着世界經濟的由恐慌期轉入蕭條期，向着正規的景氣之途回復，物價一般的高漲，購買力目然底上昇。於是遭遇了七八年厄運的蠶絲，也被帶上了景氣的道路。這裏，尤其是消費生絲佔全世界七八成的美國之景氣的正常化，給予蠶絲業以極大的扶掖；使過去岌岌可危的局勞，比較地穩定下來；—最主要的當然是絲價的穩定。將來是否能回復釗過去般一二千兩一　生絲的價格，固成問題；但我們如果仔細考察一下，覺得現在這種以七百元為中心的絲價，或者還能維持。而在此種價額之下，蠶絲業的從業者已大可維持與繼讀；且亦不無蠅利可沾；如果能够經營合理化的活。所以日本研究蠶絲價格等問題的橫濱貿易新報森本宋氏，主張减產已七年的日本蠶絲生產，應該重振旗鼓，從事增產。而給予幾被人視為無望的蠶絲事業以新的估價。這是頗符時勢之言。（詳見本年「蠶絲」十二月號森本宋氏作「送生絲减產時代」）</p>
<p>中國的蠶絲業，以一九二九年作為頂點後，簡直是江河日下，一蹶不振，淪入極度恐慌的沒落途徑。這當然一方面由於人造絲的突飛猛晋，適逢着世界經濟恐慌之會，成為時代的紡織織維的寵兒。而相當的代替生絲的用途。一方面更因日絲的傾銷，排擠華絲在國際市塲的地位，致消費市塲被奪，而使輸出銳减。至幾年來的衰落情形，想盡人皆知，母庸贅述。自從去年的上半年，絲價與絲銷入最低階段後，下半年絲價卽逐漸上昇，並且輸出激增。至今年的絲價絲銷，也大體能够維持相當的好况。於是頻危的蠶絲業，又重呈蓬勃的生氣了。</p>
<p>但是：蠺絲業雖現復蘇的景氣，究竟不能仍與過去般同樣的來從事生產經營，這是很明顯的事。過去的失敗，雖說是山於人造絲與日絲等外因的襲擊，但不能否認我們自身的缺陷之存在，與以可乘的機會。中國蠶絲業的內在癥結，一方當然是當業者的愚眛投機，所謂「墨守成規，故步自封」的結果；一方也不能否認執政當局的放任和摧殘；致造成蠶絲業祖國的隳落。其中，自然尤以技術的守舊與經營的失策為其主宰。所以在現在絲價穩定魯中，從事蠶絲生產的當業者的熊度，應該是具有科學的頭腦與改進的决心，一面反省過去的失敗，一面從事合理的改良；倒能抓住當前的機會，以圖振興我蠶絲業，恢復過去歷史的光榮。這種自身的改進和覺悟，再與政府的統制改良聯繫在一起，則不但蠶絲業的復蘇可待，再執世界牛耳的地位恢復，也並非難事。雖然日本現在的生產量，要高過我們的五六倍左右。</p>
<p>可是蠶絲業界本身的改進，情形頗為複雜我因為蠶絲的生產，歷農·工·商三過程而成半製品的原料；各過程又因經營性質的不同，於利害方面，有多少的予盾。即如農業部門之製種業與養蠶業，利害觀點就不能一致，而養蠶與製絲業間，跟着絲廠自營舉行的增多，也日益尖銳。所以在分述各業間的改進之前，應該特別提出的，就是各業間的聯合一致。以下，　想從蠶絲主要生產部門中農業部門的製種業與養蠶業及工業部門的製絲業三方面，對今後應行改進之點擇其犖犖大者，略述管見於后。至若商業部門之繭行業及生絲貿易業：前者因幾年來不景氣少賜，絲廠大率自營收繭，除繭商已比較的减少；而將來此種趨勢，更將繼續，故就其地位言，　失其重要性。且繭行業之存在，實係介乎養蠶業與製絲業中間的營利機構：　一方低價向農民買繭，再高價賣與絲廠，經一轉手之勞，而剝取巨額的利潤；因之繭行業之存在，實使蠶絲生產多一層剝削關係而已；我們站在整個蠶絲業發展的立塲上講，實有運其崩潰的希望和意圖。基此理由，故不加論述，至對生絲貿易業方面，主要是指出口商而言，但自從虎林，通運等相繼倒閉後，生絲出口貿易事業，差不多全握在外人手中。雖然最近浙江統制會在上海有生絲推銷委員會之設，但主要係推銷统制會目練生絲，其他則僅被自行永設立的機關而已。故我們除竭力希望不久的將來能有政府的推銷機關林立，以挽救過去的被人壟斷絲價之弊外，別無他求。</p>
<p>（二）製種業應有之圖之圍動向</p>
<p>民國十七八年以還，因為蠶絲彙的景氣，製種塲的設立，如雨後春筍，單單就江蘇一省而言，據二十三年申報年鑑所載：民國二十年的種塲數，有一五四家，製植二百五十萬張。可是這時的種塲經營者，並非對蠶絲業有所信心，而懷抱着改良蠺種的熱心而經營者　其大部分是以營利為目的，眼看着製種的利益豐厚，於是根本與蠶絲無關或是毫無製種常識的人，都籌資經營種塲。這裏當然不乏眞正以事業為前提的熱心入士，可是在數量上言，僅少數中的少數而已。因為製種業的經營多數是投機性質，所以他們經營的目的，僅以能得製成蠶種出賣，帥為事業告成；於次代蠶兒的良否，卽發賣給農民後的成績如何？絕對的不問不聞，故流弊業生，政府雖設有取締主持監督與取締劣種事宜，但是道高一丈，魔高百尺，終難達杜弊的目的。諸如品種龐雜，飼育馬虎等等，更是家常便飯；甚至有虛報蟻兩，購買農民所得蠶繭以製種，藉達多獲利潤之目的者。因為多係此種投機的經營，反於正常的獲利方法如維持信譽的蠶種佳良，以增農民的信任心；提倡副業，增加生產等等經營方策，不事講求。致恐慌襲來，連續倒閉者不可勝計。其中能繼續維持的，是幾個信譽比較卓著與經營比較合理的種塲。如中國合衆改良會主持下的鎭江等種塲，滸墅關的大有等等，都是好例。現在是往事已矣，來者可追。當此絲價穩定，種價種銷由政府統制規定之秋，製種業的經營，應絕對的脫離投機性質，以從事合理的經營。而所謂合理的經營云者，就是一方力求蠶種佳良，次代蠶兒蟲質强健，絲質優好，以維持與增進種塲的信譽。一方則力求生產費用節省，俾减低成本，增加產量。如是則蠶作旣得安定，並能適應蠶絲廉價生產的要旨。為達上述的目的，我以為應注意下列幾條：</p>
<p>（一）剔除過去投機性質的經營以及營業性質的經營，抱蠶絲業共存共榮的決心，以從事蠶種製造之生產事業。</p>
<p>（二）設備務求完善，俾給予原蠶以良好的環境。</p>
<p>（三）培育或精選體質强健絲質佳良之原種，嚴密飼育，使决代蠶兒得獲良果。但繭質與絲質，往往是矛盾的存在，故就我現在一般之環境及技術言，春期可稍偏絲質方面，夏秋期則宜注意虫質之彭健。</p>
<p>（四）自設專用桑園，絕對不可向外購買桑枼飼育，俾免病毒之傳染。</p>
<p>（五）提倡夏蠶及晚秋蠶，俾增進種塲本身及農民之生產。</p>
<p>（六）利用暇時，經營副業，如養鶏，養兎，養羊，養蜂等，以增種塲的收入。</p>
<p>（七）於病毒有把握時，普通種廢除櫃製，用平附或散卵的製種型式製種，以减少生產費用</p>
<p>（八）試行分塲制度。日本種塲，素採此制。係由蠶種業經營者，將原種特的農民飼育，然後集合自行製種，因之可節省很多的蠶室蠶具等固定投資。至育蠶技術水準較高以及房屋適宜之處，似可試行此制。俾得以少量之生產費用，獲得多量的蠶種，在種荒的現在，固一急救的良策；卽於將來而言，亦因固定資本之投入額少，可樹廉價製造蠶種的基礎也。</p>
<p>（三）養蠺業應有之動向</p>
<p>一般地說：中國的栽桑與養蠶業，實尚未達分業的階段。所以養蠶者必營栽桑，栽桑者必營養蠶，過去因為絲繭價格高昂，且以短期的剩餘勞力，可獲得極大的報酬，於是農民紛紛經營養蠶栽桑事業。因之養蠶的收入，不特佔據着農民經濟收入中一大位置，成為唯一的副業；甚且有全家生計，純須藉其維持，而為生產之主業者。前者加江，浙，後者如廣東是。那時的農民，無論繅製十絲也好，齊繭也好，只要蠶作有望，都是獲利倍蓰。在這種順調的情况之下，所以對於一切改良辦法等等，非常漠視，且飼育土種，致病毒蔓延，蠶作不能安定。實繭生於最近沒落的根苗。民國十八年以後，因為世界經濟恐慌等的關係，絲繭價格暴落，卽有蠶繭收穫，亦不得相當之代價。致養蠶農家，虧蝕累累，掘桑改植他種作物者不計其數，簡直視養蠶為畏途。迨去年絲價高漲，鮮繭由十餘元一担的最低額昇高，維持三十元左右的價格，農民的心理才漸漸有些改變，可是如果按照農家的出產費計算，尚有多少的虧蝕；此點鄙人前在「蠶絲統制與繭價規定」一文中，會有詳細的分析敘述。（詳見本年七月三　　至八月二日時事新報言論版）所以今後的養蠶業，不特要迥避一切含有危險性的經營方式，且須竭力使蠶繭生產費减低，藉以適應蠶絲廉價生產的目的。爰就鄙見，條述其應行改進之點如次：</p>
<p>（一）利用荒隙土地及山坡栽培桑樹，並施用自已生產之肥料，如綠肥，堆肥等，以减輕桑葉之成本。</p>
<p>（二）不養過量之蠶。在過去頗多購桑或僱工義蠶者，不但現金支出，致成本高昂，目影響蠶作，危險殊多。以後宜儘自桑與自力養蠶，以免危險。</p>
<p>（三）注意技術及聽信指導，飼育改良種，竭力吸收科學的飼育技術，以期蠶作之安全，並冀產量的增多。</p>
<p>（四）多景利用婦孺的勞力，以免多耗有用勞力。</p>
<p>（五）桑圓栽培間作，如葉用植物雜　之類、以增多生產。</p>
<p>（六）組織合作社，藉蠶農一致的團結，以抵抗及　除中間商人之創剝及壟斷。</p>
<p>歸納言之，不外（一）依自給的勞力，並（二）使用廉價生產的桑葉，（三）求蠶作的安全而巳。</p>
<p>（四）製絲業應有之動向</p>
<p>過去的製絲業經營，也和其他生產部鬥一樣，類多屬於投機性質。因經營製絲，利益既厚，又不必如麵粉廠紗廠般的巨額咨本投入；故一般商人，都樂於投資經營。經營的動機旣非為事業，於是種種經營手段，俱注重於商業方面的利潤，而忽視工業方面的利潤。商業利潤，當然一轉瞬間，卽有巨額上下；工業利潤，則數額旣少，且與經營政策的合理化與技術的科學化等相聯繫；而一般投資經營者，於技術更係門外漢。故不得不放棄經固可靠的工業利潤，而把經營政策商業化，在這種塲合之下，當然發生種種的畸形現象。廠主非經營製絲者，而製絲經營者，類多臨時集資，租廠經營；對於設備與技術的改進，廠方是不關痛癢，租方也是臨時感覺，當然是數十年如一日了。用繭能繅成絲，就算目的已達，其他自不問不聞。在這種經營方式下的生產物，品質如何？我們不難想像。而際此科學日趨進步，人類物質享受的慾望日益高漲的時候，中國生絲的不能在此界市塲立足，固是意料中事，何况更有經濟恐慌的襲擊，人造絲的躍進與日絲在世界市塲的排擠？</p>
<p>因為絲價暴落的結果，製絲業是日就沒落之途，江浙二省二百家左右的絲廠中，最少時竟有僅開工七八家者：而因經營絲業以致破產者，正不知多少！此種沒落的激化，實開近年來各工業沒落的先例。故現在之亟應抓住機會，力圖更生，誠不待言也。以下試就鄙意，條述其今後應行改進的原則如次；</p>
<p>（一）改革過去的商業經營政策，而以事業為前提，力求產品的精良興信譽的樹立。</p>
<p>（二）改良機械設備，並聘用專門技術人材，以從事生產，</p>
<p>（三）自營收　烘　學彙，一方避免中間人的剝削，一方求原料的優良確保。</p>
<p>（四）終年經營，使工作人員得安心工作。俾得能率增進，而能减低生產費與增加生產量。</p>
<p>（五）利用副產；如乾下脚濕下脚等的加工處理，　增加生產。</p>
<p>（六）與各絲廠聯絡，求品質的均一整齊。</p>
<p>總之：一方能得廉價製造多量的生絲，一方更須品質佳良，俾達「價廉物美」的目的。此不但可維持生絲的市塲，且得因之而擴展生絲的用途。至如去年之因絲價好轉，即以極劣品的生絲，冒充上級品運美，致遭退回，而失信用的作僞行為，以後更應絕對避免，否則實係自絕於人也。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>總之：蠶絲事業是整個的，其聞具有有機性的機構。所以我們一而旣要求其各個生產部鬥的力避衝突，速絡進行；一面厦要求各業間能同比例的改進。日本正在大發疾呼地要求着的「蠶絲業體系之再建」，就是各業間大家抱共存共榮的宗旨團結一致的從事合作生產之謂。因為各業的生產手段與方式雖然不同，而其生產蠶絲的職責則一。聯絡一致，方能獲蠶絲生產「價廉物美」之効。如單就其一部門改進，當然是事倍功半，成効微渺。這是各業間應該特別認識淸楚的要義。也是各業間亟應自覺的一點。至於政府方面，一方應站在提倡獎勵督促的立塲上，以執行蠶絲業的統制管理，蠲除或緩和各業間的矛盾，藉助長各業間的團結與促進各業間的革新。又如蠶絲事業的試騐，蠶絲業生產金融的流通，與業間不易自動經營或執行的墾荒植桑，區域性的統一品種，乾繭賣買，統一絲牌與品質，直接外銷等等有利用蠶絲業前途的事業，應該竭力的促成；而如直接外銷等人民不能舉辦時，政府斥資經營，俾蠶絲業當業者得在政府的整個管理統制下，確立中興的基礎。</p>
<h3>各省糧食管制之回顧</h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>關於應付今年有秋之歲的糧食問題，筆者會於本刊一九四期發表之『豐年問題之檢討』文中主張三個辦法：</p>
<p>（一）在米穀過剩省份，積極推行簡易倉儲政策，吸收餘糧，用以削弱米價下落之威脅。</p>

<p>（三）在米糧自給省份，則由地方政府管理糧食買賣。</p>
<p>綜其論旨：要無非使今歲之鹽年問題，依其所方性質之不同，暫時採用急救手術以謀解決。故最後復主張『全國上下一心分工台作，實寓內外相維之意，而收調劑均衡之效。乃自今年新貨登塲之初，糧價早先見新而步趨上漲；嗣後愈演愈高，有非吾人意料所能及。此種反常事變，自易激起各省地方當局就地應付之可能，故·各省當局陸讀實施區域性的糧食管制；與筆奢前所主張似相符合，但其中不無有商榷之餘地。茲雖自中央頒布糧食調節暫行辦法（十一月二十五日）之後，各省市仍准自由流通；然點察糧市趨勢，來日方長，正不知何若。是以對於過去事實，尚有重加檢討之可能，而作未來之方針，為申述如次：</p>
<p>（二）各省糧食管制乏經過</p>
<p>自豐年收糧貴相對的問題先後發生以來，各省當局為謀緩和問題之嚴重化起見；均有相當積極之處置。茲將全國重要省份歸納為米產過剩區，米產自給區與米產不足區三類；就其當局應付糧食問題之方針與經過，分別敘述如各下。</p>
<p>甲　米產過剩省份</p>
<p>湖南　湘省向為米產策源地，古有『湖廣熟天下足』之諺。本年九月一日，自粤漢鐵路全綫通車後；省當局對於湘米秋熟後之應付方針，卽抱定以改善運銷方法為宗旨。緣先是湘·粤·贛·鄂·四省當局，本早有經濟合作之成議；故湘·粤當局趁此粤漢路全綫告成之時，湘省決以湘米運銷入粤，而粤復以粤鹽運銷入湘，作為湘粤兩省經濟合作之先導。此案定奪後，湘省當局為便於推銷湘米起見：由建設廳，商准上海中國·交通·上海·金城·大陸·鹽業·中南·國華·國貨·郵政備匯局，四行儲蓄會等十一家銀行，聯合協助辦理湘米銷粤押滙；其押滙總額，聞為一千萬元。規定由湘省雋貨商將貨物運往指定之地點，卽以提貨單，保險單，發票件交與承做押滙之銀行，先申請貸欵八成；俟貨物運扺目的地後，靑由買賣貨商歸還銀行欵子，取得提貨單提貨。其押滙利息，須視糧食商人之信用而定；大致最高月息，不得超過一分。同時為提高湘米信用計，由實業部派員來湘，在長沙沒立湘米檢騐所；歸實業部制定檢騐規程，免費檢騐銷夸湘米；其不合格者，則不准運粤銷售。而在粤漢路方面，為促進湘粤經濟合作起見：業巳規定自十一月一日起，凡整車湘米在湘境各站裝運入粤者，（入鄂亦同）准一律按五等普通運價五折核收；在湘米銷粤的運費方面，又復减輕了一半負担。</p>
<p>江西　贛省為長江流域重要農區，年有大量米穀運往外省；故亦屬米產過剩省份。今年早晚禾稼均慶豐收；省當局對於本年度之糧食問題早經决定對內為倉儲，對外為運銷。在倉儲方面，業已決定將全省割分為四個農業倉庫儲押貸欵區；由該省農村合作委員會負責辦理。其儲押資金來源，係商由中國·交通·中國農民·江西浴民等四家銀行在各該放欵區內直接儲押或委托辦理。至於運銷方而，本未擬為贛米從粤浙二省開發出路；惟以滬杭甬與浙贛兩路，對於贛米尚未核减運費，故在運輸上，尚待斟酌。在路局對於贛未銷浙運費米核减前，決先從贛米湘粤入手；此舉業經由官商雙方集資五十萬元，組織一家官督民營性質之糧食運銷公司；用以承辦贛米銷粤之業務。（朱完）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （太玄）</p>
<p>知足與知恥，是每個人立身處世的根本大道；我們現在就拿知足中的取與來講，凡屬分內所應得的，當然受之無愧，分內所不應得的，就應該一介不取。因為聲色貨利，為人類之大欲，同時，也為人類之大敵。古今來英俊豪傑之士，犧牲在這上面的，不知道有多多少少。像孟子所說的：「食前方丈，侍妾數百人，吾得志勿為也。」這固然是孟子在當時看到那提有權威者之一種奢侈淫佚的行為，有感而發的，也就是人類不能知足的寫照。</p>
<p>知恥呢，是一個富有上進的最好刺激。因為一個稍有節操之士，在它受到相常恥辱的時侯，決不能默爾而息，必然的從着羞惡之心，跨入了奮發自立自强的環境中去掙扎，來一湔此恥。古人說：「知恥近乎勇。」這個勇，便是從恥字而生的。</p>
<p>這年頭，人人應該知足，人人應該知恥，這便是生在現代的中國人立身處世的大道！</p>
<h3>那裏省不下錢來？</h3>
<p>— 戴中新</p>
<p>前方泳天雪地，望着後方的援助。在後方的人們，踴躍輸將的雖然很多，但只顧自己不願援綏的也不少。他們都說沒有錢沒有錢，其實那裏省不下錢呢？譬如說：</p>
<p>市面上花樣新奇的熱水袋眞好看，價錢也很便宜。但我去年的一隻還沒有破，雖說顏色淡了些，但包在手帕裏也看不出，將就些罷！</p>
<p>天還不十分冷，房間裏的媒爐，怪刺鼻的，停幾天再生。</p>
<p>新年快到了，回憶去年買的賀年片還有，找找看，就用這些偽的吧！如果不够，少寄幾份也不妨！</p>
<p>今年的花價特別大，棉花胎要半塊錢一磅，我本想彈條新被絮，等明年花價跌了再買吧！</p>
<p>膏滋藥還沒有煎，去年的方子不好用了，眞麻煩！好了，藥補不如食補，還是買些肉來吃吃吧。</p>
<p>新出的絲絹絨比維也納好，並且是道地國貨，最好去買一疋來做襯衫。不，不知他經用不經用，落水硬不硬，不如先剪五尺料來做一件看，如果經用，我們明年再剪。</p>
<p>明弟有信來，他們每人要捐一塊錢。玲兒校中也要捐三角大洋，這倒是不能省的，我們就少買一塊臘肉吧，這些錢不能不給他。</p>
<p>今天發薪水了，今天晚上到大光明去看小孤星好不好？不，晚上這般冷，誰願意在八九點鐘出去看影戲！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>如果常常這樣想，那裏省不下錢來援助為民族爭光榮的前方將士？</p>
<h3>黃膺白與莊崧甫</h3>
<p>— 錢大</p>
<p>國府委員黃膺白氏，患肝癌絕症，久病不愈，終於本月六日，與世長逝，黃氏服務黨國，歷史深長，與陳英士先生相交至篤，曾歷任陳之參謀長，可見其關係之密切，惟氏與陳先生最初相識時之介紹者，世人或多未知，蓋卽前立法委員兼導淮委員會副委員長奉化莊崧甫氏也。莊氏賦性剛介，一生淸廉自守，初設新學會社於上海，從事革命工作，總理及陳先生以下諸革命領袖，常往聚談，表面雖為一書肆，實則革命機關耳。黃氏微時，卽與莊稔，友誼亦至篤，迨後黃銜淸廷之命，被振南下調查南方革命情形，時莊氏適襄贊陳先生革命，比抵滬，卽往說之，於是介與陳先生相見，黃氏固傾心革命已久，對於陳先生，早具相當景仰，遂一見如舊識，訂為莫逆交，且佐陳先生造成無數偉業，初非淸廷所料也。莊氏在餘杭設有林牧公司，經營不遺餘力，不時往來於滬杭間，有時亦返奉化故里，每値黃氏在滬，莊氏輒往訪晤暢敘，蓋二氏均淡於名利，勤儉自矢，個性頗有相同之點也。黃氏與蔣委員長有金蘭之契，平時得其貢獻策劃至多，被刺殞命之鄂主席楊暢卿氏，得事蔣委員長，卽黃氏保舉之力也。今溘然畏逝年僅五十有七，從此黨國又失一大政治家，於國家前途，殊屬損失匪淺，故耗音傳來，無論識與不識，莫不為之震悼。莊氏與蔣委員畏私誼甚篤，為奉化革命前輩，現年已七十有七，精神尚矍鑠如壯年人夙以廉潔正直，為人所稱道，雖歷官顯要，而鮮積蓄，頗屬難能，今黃氏物故，莊氏失一老友，其中心當至悲梗已。愚識莊氏久，遇其來滬，輒往謁晤，氏於孔子之學，極有研究，嘗與愚合纂孔子聖蹟一書，今尚由新學會社發行也</p>

<p>第九回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>怪不得在他書信往還之中滿佈着憂愁的情諸。可是他所含藏着的憂愁情緒，是他的恨史羞史不能對人吐露一個字的，自然不好對一個新認識的朋友去說了。心裏只是道樣的估量着，也忘了身在何所，手上拿了那柄摺扇，打開來扇扇，扇過之後，又摺疊了在手掌心裏握着，只管昂頭向天上望了去。很久很久的時候，搖了兩搖頭。身後却有劉媽揷言了，他道：先生，你不出去嗎？國器回轉頭來向他笑道：我覺得天氣熱，我不去了。劉媽笑道：旣是天氣很熱，你先生在屋子裏怎麽把長衫穿上了？國器呵呀一聲，忙着把長衣服脫了下來笑道：我是會客以後，接着又想出去，所以忘了脫畏衣了。於是左手把自己的短汗衫牽着，右手拿了摺扇極力的對了懷裏屬去。劉媽站在房門口，向他看着，笑問道：先生剛才穿了長衫，站在這裏，只管想什麼似的。手裏捏了扇子，一動也不一動。現在脫了長衫，倒是比以前更熱了。國器道：你們做粗工的人，那裏會知道。念書的人，想起做文章來，在冰雪裏不會知道冷，在大太陽裏，不會知道熱。劉媽好像很領會他的意思，對他微笑了一笑，自走開了。可是在這日下午起，他眞合了那句話，不知道熱，也不知道飢渴，就是道樣的呆坐在書桌邊的籐椅上。劉媽屢决由這裏進出，全不會介意。後來過着有兩小時了，看到國器坐着不動，還是那個樣子，便遠遠的站定，向他臉上很張望了一陣，因問道：先生，你身體有些不舒服嗎？國器還是昂了頭，看那窗戶外的天色。經劉媽連問過兩决，他才醒悟過來，回轉頭來笑道：你看我那裏像生病的樣子，你這話不是問得奇怪嗎？劉媽碰了他一個釘子，不敢多說什麽，自走開了。一會兒工夫，章老太可在門外面呌道：國器，你又在屋子裏想文章嗎？國器呵呀一聲，站了起來。章老太走進房來，對於屋子四週，全看了一看。因笑問道：你眞是個書呆子。這樣大熱天，無論在什麽地方，也少不了拿一把扇子扇着。你儘管坐在屋子裏想什麽？（一一二）</p>

<h3>英國的捉鼠專家</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>倫敦有一老人，名達繭頓，是英國的捉鼠專家，也可算得倫敦城的忙人之一。論他的年紀，盡司以在家享福，讓他的三個兒子接辦他的營業，但他仍舊精神矍鑠，不肯放棄此業。論到此業，卻有一種秘密，自一七九〇年起，在達氏一門中，是父傳子，不傳給外人的。達爾頓　十年來在倫教開設一捉鼠行，除三個兒子外，　僱了同族的子弟十六個人做帮手，他們二十人每夜必應人之招，出外捉鼠。他們活動的範圍，不但在倫敦一處，英倫各島都有他們的足跡。英國最重要的辦公所和住家，多和達氏訂了台同，按期前往捉鼠，他們每星期所捉的總數，平均在八百至千隻之間。達氏近會和觀察報代表談述捉鼠營業，他說：英國有捉鼠專技的人，並不多，鼠性狡猾，非知其性，是很難手到成擒的。英國的老鼠增多的速度，很可驚人，上年他一行共捉得五萬六千隻，在倫敦捉着的，共一萬六千餘隻，據他估計，倫敦在三年中所增多的鼠，不下一萬五千隻，其中十成之九，是隨世界各處到倫敦的船在靠碼頭時黑夜中溜上岸的。這一種鼠名呌船鼠，英國舊有的黑鼠，差不多已被挪威傳來的大鼠或陰溝鼠滅盡，陰溝鼠也是船鼠的仇敵，他所捉得的鼠，最大的重兩磅六盎斯半。達氏雖以捉鼠為業，但很看得起鼠的，他說道小東西卻有大腦子，是極靈敏的。達氏且不以鼠能傳病為然，他說他一生沒有花過一文錢買藥翳病，人們都不知老鼠是很淸潔的，它們常常摩擦周身，以求潔凈。達氏並自負他所經手捉的鼠，除去用煤氣熏它們出門的外，都是活而未受傷的，每星期他總在波羅路附近住家內用無痛苦的法兒把所捉的鼠弄死。計他平生所斃的鼠，不知道有好幾百萬隻。倫敦當局近來因為每年被鼠所損毀的物品，價値的數字很高，所以施行撲減鼠患的計畫。據達氏意見，那些計畫是無效的，老鼠會從電報綫上烟囪管中和門縫等處逃走，所以你在有鼠患的區內挨戶去捉，是勞而無功的，只要有一對逃出，隔一年，便會增至千隻。達氏於是便誇口道：「只有我能對付這問題。」達氏所最主張的兩點，一是房屋拆造之前，必須派人把屋內的鼠捉盡，免得鼠在拆屋時逃去。二是城中各戶的垃圾，勿在淸晨而在夜間收集，斷絕鼠的食料供給。達氏憑了他的捉鼠的專技，居然過着很快樂的生活。</p>

<h3>記最近高考中之郁漢良</h3>
<p>— 軼劉</p>
<p>科名之事，自昔所難，千百人中，行險僥幸，其獲也實無異探　龍頷下珠，幸而售，雖孫山榜尾，無不詫為奇遇，若為龍頭，則尤屬　世難逢，故科舉之世，一衿乍靑，里黨喧傳，爭相矜貴，視為非常人。逮夫春秋聯捷。衣錦歸鄉，人且駭為天上神仙，不敢正眼覷。其間鄉會殿三試，倘一試而元，則同案交諛，市人爭看，炫耀煊赫，殆不可名，三元連魁者，國家且誌稱祥瑞，而其人實亘代不一觀，無他，千百人中，背城借一，巳屬大難，矧其為千百人中之元，千百人中之連魁乎。比歲考政易軌，宏科舉之體，演為實用。而國是更新，民智旁溥，庠序之教，亦旣遍布，文明之瀾，孟晋不時。束髪咿唔，逾冠攻苦，向所視為異人任者，今則通國皆是。為學者旣多，求用者隨夥。於是及鋒而試，比於汀鯽，一度傳封，萬人射策，求售愈急，倖獲愈難。故一行獲雋，其各貴實遠勝於前茲，而况鰲頭獨占，高步天衢者，其視衆人，又當何如？會憧試榜初開，首决之元，名朱雷章。課續優異，震鑠一時。今其人巳躍為中委，且任監察，糾劾無所避，風裁峻當世。然朱僅一試脫穎，初無他異。若此次高考中，敎育行政系首名郁漢良，則其人造詣之過人，發榜之異數，既非歷屆取士所可比擬，且非歷代試士所能方軌，不可謂非多士之冠冕，曠代之奇逢也。郁氏短小精悍，沈毅端肅，年事雖不逾三十，而淵雅類碩儒。接物恂如，無假高論，而理致爛然，得王休徵無言而神理自超之概。籍蘇之崇明笈來滬上，人省立上海中學，自入學試迄高中卒業，又皆以第一人壓倒羣儕。嗣困於力，輟學，敎　於上海市高橋區市立高橋小學。性好學，膏晷不間。課餘之暇，輒悉心自修，舉經世之學遍窺之，研索攻苦，不知寒暑。嘗應浙江普通文官考試，膺首薦歸，三放縣司鐸不就，嘆曰：「丈夫會以異才取青紫，何事此雞肋為」？遂設敎如故。既而就試上海普通考試，又獲冠軍。入都應高等考試，以案首登選。迨正試放榜，則巍然居首者又郁氏也。嘻　是亦奇矣！榜發後，典試者以氏卷藝雋出，特召褒美，副院長鈕，且從而歸美上中校長鄭，誡名塲之佳話矣。綜計氏向小學迄高考，身歷數十試，無試不首列，從不作第二人想，此古賢所難能，歷史所罕覯者，殆邦國之祥符歟？氏於入京日，偶購航空券，榜發而券售，名利兩至，幸運之來，無獨有偶，奇乎奇乎？院例列前茅者，得儘先留部補用。繼目今氏之宏展驥足，　廳經綸，將拭目而俟之矣。</p>

<h3>聖誕節與苦兒同樂大會</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>看見報上有許多兒童玩具的廣吿，才意會到所謂「耶穌聖誕」就快到了。</p>
<p>聖誕節的前夜，洋孩子和準洋孩子們大都有一個夢，夢着聖誕老人笑嘻嘻地從壁爐的烟囱裏爬下來，給他們許多糖果和玩具，等醒過來，果然，聖誕樹上的蠟燭熄了，他們的床前也堆了許多糖果和玩具，回頭看看爸爸和媽媽呢，却睡得正甜，從化裝跳舞會帶來的紙帽子，就多丟在地下。</p>
<p>這樣的快樂自然至少是小康之家的孩子才能享受得到，窮孩子是沒份的。不過也有例外，例如「苦兒同樂大會」，望文生義，便知道那是專誠給「苦兒」們「同樂」的。</p>
<p>據報上所載，今年的聖誕苦兒同樂大會，將在七大戲院同時舉行，節目方面，除「傳播快樂，鼓勵苦兒向上精神」以及「並有各項游藝表演，以助興趣」之外，「末後並分贈糖果散會」云。苦兒們終年衣食不周，難得有這麽一個有游藝看，有糖果吃的「同樂」機會，那自然是受寵若驚，感激不盡的。自己是已過童年了，小時候也沒有參加過這樣的會，所以「苦兒」們在宣吿散會的剎那作何感想，便無從說起，以情理度之，大槪終會好景嫌短，恨不得「同樂」下去吧？就是已過了童年的我，寫到這裏，而想到宣吿散會時的情形，也彷彿有一種說不出的遺憾似的。</p>
<p>但苦兒同樂大會却終究不能不散，散了之後，那些苦兒還是得過流浪生活去，他們雖然同樂了一下，但在「同樂」之後，又跌到冰窖裏去了。</p>
<p>自然，以聯勝於無的說法，同樂大會是有他存在的意義的，它終究給「苦兒」們樂過一下的呀！較之「高調」，苦兒們終究還多吃到一些糖果。這樣的理由，粗看自然不能算錯，但我却不能同意它。我不敢說苦兒同樂大會的動機不在乎苦兒的「樂」，而還有其他的原因，卽使是單純的為了苦兒的同樂吧，我也覺得如果不能醫好病體，上麻醉劑是一件罪惡。如果僅僅是為了减痛，因痛使病人覺得病了，有時也跟常人差不多，那居心自然是更不堪問的。若要在上麻醉劑的時候，還要使病人對術士引起一種好感，那在術士自然是引以為得計，而病人却會因為偶然有止痛藥可解，而不急切求治，使病狀延綿下去，於是結果便不免是病人死亡！</p>
<p>苦兒們從同樂大會散出來，他們大槪是頗感恩於「上帝」和他的代言人的，他們在受到風雪的侵凌之餘，在幼稚的心靈中，也將永遠記着「上帝」的格言，而盼望着「上帝」來搭救他們吧？</p>
<h3>雪地</h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>搬進這村里來，不到幾天，就聽說山上的野虎山狼，常在夜間到這兒來損擾牲畜。人們打通了村，騐不出足印，也沒有人聽見呌吼聲，地主們底猪羊，却常在猪圈里失得沒影沒跡，有時是整隻，有時留下了一灘血跡。</p>
<p>淸早出太陽的時候，大家就紛紛的集到洪秀才底館口來晒太陽。於是乎，各種新奇的傳說，新奇的發現也來了。當卽有人說：老虎昨晚來過，其所以沒有傷損牲畜，完全是由於自己在月光下看見了，從史樓上偸偸的向它開了一槍。</p>
<p>人們被這新奇的叙述吸住了。</p>
<p>「那麽後來呢？……」</p>
<p>「我那時沒有看淸，月亮被雲籠住了。」叙述者興奮地揚着手，口沫在四周飛濺着。「我只看見它咆吼了一聲，在地底下打了一個翻身，就望山上竄走。」</p>
<p>「是的，我也聽見，那是非常可怕的一聲。」</p>
<p>「我敢斷定，它一定是受傷了，不然為什麽在地下打滾。……」</p>
<p>嘆息的聲調，從十個以上的人們口裏噴將出來，沒有聽見的人們，看見了人家這麽眞切的說着，也只好承認自己是聽見過的；不相信的人們，也只好點頭相信了。他們憑着空想，憑着夢中的記憶，在腦子裏描畫着那猛虎，咆哮過，而且在地下翻過身的猛虎。</p>
<p>在這兒，我常常碰見一個靜默的中年農人，他關於虎底事，比誰都感到興趣，可是意見却比誰都少。十年前，他背着一個用番巾打成的包袱到這村裏來，寄住在土地祠裏，白天挨着那些地主人家走，看看沒有短工做，晚上便推進土地祠那潮濕的房間休息，按照着一定的程序生活着，像一架機械那麽和平。這其間，也發生過一次大事變，那時有一個地主，發現了自己底小老婆有幾件金飾品失掉了，他們便推測着這偸竊的賊子，結果一致地斷定是那個睡在土地祠裏的佃工，因為他窮，而且常在他們家裏走動；於是，土地祠被搜查着，他也被三牲似的綑綁着吊在地主家的禾草間。第二天便被送區了。</p>
<p>不久，他被放了出來，原因是失掉金飾的小老婆，受不了良心的責罰溜走了。到這時，誰都知道偸竊的不是那佃工，而是那地主的小老婆，她把自己底金飾送給情人去了。</p>
<p>被放出來後，他照樣的生活在土地祠裏，介理，他已不再在人家裏走動了，有時人家來呌，也推故不去，他變得偸懶，靜默，而且好傷感，常常整天不說一句話地把自己關在土地祠裏，有時在路上碰見了地主們不管是熟人或陌生人，一槪遠遠就避開，直等他們走遠了才從躱避的地方出來，恨恨的吐着涎沫，表示他的憎惡。</p>
<p>當大家，熱熱的給虎底故事哄動着的時候，他就那麽冷淡地坐在遠處，不大被注意的角落，有力的吸着自己底烟筒。但有人問他：</p>
<p>「大禿，你看見虎沒有？」</p>
<p>他便睜大了眼睛，盯盯的看着對方，一點表情也沒有地站起來，擺擺手走開。</p>
<p>有一晚，我還沒有睡着，忽然被連串的鑼聲機槍驚住了。我忙披衣起床，隨手抓了一把兇器，跑出門去。在屋子外，整羣農民正在奔走着，握着電筒，提緊卜克槍。我在門口站立一會，抓住一個熟人問，才知道老虎又下山咬地主們底猪，現在正被追着爬向山去。</p>
<p>整個山坡都罩滿着白皚皚的雪片，月光皎好地在天上照着，雪地裏有一個大黑點在奔走着，後面是幾十個黑點在追，槍聲連疊着響，貫澈了寒冷的夜空。</p>
<p>忽然，那大黑點在雪地上搖擺了一會兒便不動了，登時呌號聲和排槍聲，就隨着洋溢過去。我們走得慢，趕到時那死虎已被捉住了，擠開驚異的人羣，才知道那擾亂了人們幾個月不能安靜的猛虎，原來就是睡在土地祠那個佃工披着虎皮装成的。</p>
<p>大家驚嘆了一會！同轉頭走。那時，雪花又飄飄的下了。</p>

<p>帶好。持怡急急走園林。行來巳到瀟湘館。姑娘是，作罷詩章纔擱筆。丫環忽報二爺臨。只見他，今朝打扮非往昔。寶哥哥，何事效學漁翁形。公子間言忙相問。妹妹身處可安寗。藥可吃，飯可增，近日不可把詩吟。我是終朝心難放。故而冒雨探分明。妹妹若爱此裝束。緩日卽當送一身。顰卿回言何需此。漁翁形像實無名。話出口，暗思忖，漁翁漁婆不該云。桃花面泛羞難掩。默默但頭不作聲。一個是，無意言語偏說錯。一個是，未聞情竇豈知情。紅樓一夢多變幻。聊表那，問病瀟湘一段姻。恨月老不牽情絲線。故使醫藥　無靈。徒負變變一片心。</p>

<p>春深三月下揚州。琴劍書箱共一舟。頃刻相逢成莫逆。云卿公子共南樓。刁毛唐品金蘭義。八拜之交日唱酬。平山塘玩諸名勝。知己同心繞自由。忽見勢豪無賴子。諸奴搶刦女姣羞。據云張得龍之子。仗義英雄怒不休。都抱不平同解救。豪奴惡主結深仇。當時妓女蒙恩德。屈向留春院里遊。周全考試毛龍費。東道無成不必憂。羞濤行囊遙迢路。斷乎難向帝王州。柳亭籛別纔分手。雙袂相移雙淚流。從此別離難見面。英雄歸去中奸謀。阻隔陰陽兩地愁。</p>
<p>電影</p>
<h3>雜談「壯志凌云」</h3>
<p>「壯志凌雲」是新華公司適應着這個非常時期攝製的一部空前悲壯熱烈鉅片，現在已經完工大吉，就要在元旦日起在全國各大都市聯合獻映。新華當局曾有把這部片子給國人當一帖興奮劑的宣言，所以在攝製的過程中，一點都不苟且，如全部戰爭塲面，都用眞槍實彈來拍，而遠赴鄭州攝取外景，耗去二萬多金的豪舉，更是不容忽視的事實。</p>
<p>這部片子是吳永剛所編導，吳先生的作品一向是很前進的，技巧也非常圓熟，這部「壯志凌雲」將給我們感到非常的滿意，是可預料的。</p>
<p>演員方面，這裏是集合了中國影壇上第一流的人才，如金燄，王人美，陳娟娟，王次龍，韓蘭根，黎明健，田方，章志直，施超，宗由等，他們都是經騐充裕為我們所仰慕的影人，眞可以說是天衣無縫的合作。</p>
<h3>慾海沉寃</h3>
<p>南京映</p>
<h3>中國旅行劇團回滬</h3>
<p>不日在卡爾登戲院公演</p>
<p>曾經轟動全滬受各界人仕熱烈歡迎之中國唯一職業話劇集團中國旅行劇團，於本年九月間在滬上公演後，卽赴湘鄂各埠旋行公演，所到之處，萬人空巷，極受歡迎，該團原擬入川旅行，因受本埠卡爾登戲院再四電邀，特改變行程，於昨日乘江輪由漢抵滬，聞稍事休息，將於本月念三日起在該院作第三次公演。據該團團長唐槐秋君　稱，此次公演，除上次所演之名劇外，尚有新劇多齣，已經排就，將陸續真獻於滬上諸愛美仕女，想屆時派克路上，車水馬龍，常又有一番盛况也。</p>
<h3>開於「清明時節」</h3>
<p>歐陽予倩的「淸明時節」，將在二十三日起在金城大戲院上映了。這裏作一個簡短的介紹：</p>
<p>這影片的劇作者是姚莘農，以一種尖俏生動的筆法寫出了一個大家庭的活劇，同時，予一羣掙扎於生存綫上的人們一種熱切的同情。全劇的結搆是奇特的生趣，畏江輪上有兩個男子漢為一個漂流出來的女人仗義保鏢這一段格外可愛。他告訴着只有在同一條路綫上一樣掙扎淸的人們之間才有着所謂「同情」，此外，是只有陰謀的「利用」，只有虛僞的「笑臉」，是無法合到一起去的。</p>
<p>黎明暉演一個淪落天涯的苦女子，在凄慘的流亡路程中，她認識了趙丹他們一羣人，他們都帮助她同情她，她便和他們一起工作，一起生活起來，同時，趙丹和她是發生了愛情，一個從來只受過奸污，只過着冷酷的生活的可憐女孩是被這種感情所燻醉了。她是演出到十分美滿，其實，對於黎明暉，憑我們過去的印象，也可以深信她的成績的。</p>
<p>此外，趙丹，李麗連，舒綉紋，吳茵，吳茵等無庸個別介紹，他們都有着超異的成就。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩自從「桃花屬」之後，尚是第二次的作品，在「淸明時節」中，他是有了更　高更美的創造，特別成功的該是所描寫的各種人物，如「歪脖子」老年風流的老爺太太，等等，都特別地生動，有趣，而又眞實。</p>
<p>在今年，「淸明時節」好像是成為了一部一壓軸戲」了。</p>
<h3>「女同學」中的陳綺霞</h3>
<p>陳綺霞確是一位極有希望的新人，自從她主演的「黃浦江邊」公映以後，她給予觀衆良好的印象，受觀衆熱烈的歡迎。這榚就奠定了她在銀壇的地位。</p>
<p>有聲電影的演員，除了默片演員所應該備具的條件以外，更要國語流利，，口齒淸晰，她雖然生長南方，可是從小就學習國語，聲帶又因受了京劇的訓練，發音非常高朗而淸晰，加以她的面貌美麗，演技美妙，她確是一位全材的有聲電影的演員。</p>
<p>她在「黃浦江邊」中飾一個搖舢板的姑娘，活潑天眞，宛似依人小烏，現在她在「女同學」中飾一位養尊處優的摩登小姐，個性較前更加吻合，她比在「黃浦江邊」中更美麗活潑，演技也有更進一步的成功。</p>

In addition to Chairman Chiang, there were also Chiang Ting-wen, Zhu Shaoliang, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, Wei Lihuang, Wan Yaohuang, Chen Tiaoyuan, Ma Zhanshan, Chiang Zuobin, Zeng Kuangqing, Shao Lizi, Qian Dajun, Zhang Chong, Chiang Fangzhen, etc. Those who were killed included Shao Yuanchong, Chiang Xiaoxian, Xiao Naihua, as well as Yang Zhenya, the commander of the Military Police Regiment, and Ma Zhiqiang, the chief of the Xi'an Public Security Bureau. Ma's death was the most tragic. It is said that a majority of the rebels nailed Ma to the city gate. Qian Dajun was also injured and is currently receiving treatment at He Zhuguo's place. There have been robberies in Xi'an from time to time, and it is still chaotic. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

He flew to Nanjing on a Eurasia plane. According to him, Chairman Chiang is safe, and the order in the city, which was once chaotic on the 12th, has now been restored to normal.

<p>(Nanjing) Li Hongwen, the resident representative in Nanjing of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, said that he had received telegrams from Director Yan in recent days, stating that the work of saving the country and resisting foreign aggression must be carried out with the unity and solidarity of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. The most important issue at present is to escort Chairman Chiang safely back to Nanjing. Otherwise, no matter how we advocate saving the country and resisting foreign aggression, it is all false. Yan has repeatedly telegraphed Nanjing, sincerely supporting the Central Government in rescuing Chairman Chiang from danger, and is planning diligently day and night to find practical solutions. As for the four questions that Director Yan raised to Zhang Xueliang in a previous telegram, Zhang did send a reply, but it was not entirely sincere. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Yun and Wang Telegraph Requesting Increased Military Preparedness for Bailingmiao: Not Only Is It Crucial to the Survival of North China, But Also to the Survival of the Nation</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Yun and Wang recently telegraphed Chief Lin, Chairman Chiang, Director Yan Wenyun, (title omitted), "Ever since the National Army recovered Bailingmiao on November 14, the whole country has rejoiced, allowing officials and civilians who had long lost their freedom to escape from misery and ascend to prosperity. All those with blood and spirit feel as moved as heaven and earth. Upon investigation, Bailingmiao is located at the crossroads of Sui, Xinjiang, and Gansu, and is a military fortress and the key to the Northwest. When the Manchus entered the pass and Outer Mongolia bordered Sui, this was the military center of gravity. It is not only crucial to the survival of North China, but also to the survival of the nation. We pray that military preparedness be quickly and substantially increased and that it be regarded as essential to defend. Yun is an ignorant old Mongol, born and raised in this land, and knows the terrain more accurately. In addition to offering sheep and cattle to comfort the soldiers at the front, I vow to uphold my national responsibility and my long-standing commitment to supporting the Central Government, to organize and lead the Mongol cavalry to assist Chairman Chuan and General Shang in defending the country and the borders. The mountains and rivers are lovely, and my ambition is unwavering. I present my humble opinions with utter sincerity. Chief Prince of the Urad League and Member of the National Government, Yunduanwangchuke, seal." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Zhang's Rebellion Unrelated to Northeasterners: The Government Forgives Zhang's Individual Misconduct</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter recently visited a member of the Central Committee, who said that Northeasterners living in various places are deeply pained and indignant that Zhang Xueliang has taken the absurd and unparalleled action of detaining the commander-in-chief at a time when the whole country is united in resisting foreign aggression and seeking survival. The government deeply understands that this is Zhang's individual misconduct and is not related to the general Northeasterners, nor is it even related to his direct subordinates, who are likely acting under duress. Therefore, it is known that the Northeasterners will work together with the zeal of saving the country and loving their homeland to rescue the chairman. The people of the country will also understand the plight of the Northeasterners and give them special sympathy. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Telegrams Zhang Xueliang, Offering Further Advice</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Liu Zhi, Pacification Commissioner of Henan and Anhui, received a telegram from the rebel Zhang Xueliang in the past few days, indicating that he intended to reform, but his words were still ambiguous. Liu sent a reply telegram on the 19th, offering advice in the hope that he would wake up and not become a sinner of treason and rebellion, to be cursed by all for eternity. His words were weighty and meaningful, enough to awaken him. The text reads: "Since hearing about the incident, I have been filled with sorrow and indignation. Upon receiving your telegram, I feel choked with emotion. At this time when the international situation is so critical, saving the country and resisting foreign aggression are what everyone desires. What you have stated in your telegram shows different perspectives and understandings. To be flexible or strict depends on the urgency of the situation. The point is that these major national policies cannot be arbitrarily decided by one person, and the chairman should not be coerced or threatened into rebellion. To call it saving the country is to hasten its demise. I remember when the Guangzhou incident arose last summer, you sent a telegram saying that the enemy is stronger than us and that it would be dangerous if the central government did not have a complete plan and the country did not have uniform steps. You also said, 'If you do not want to save the country, so be it. If you really want to save the country, then you must go to Nanjing as scheduled, let the public decide on national affairs, and let the central government plan the overall situation. In doing so, you can show that you have no other intentions, and the country can expect to win.' Now I also say that if you do not want to save the country, so be it. If you sincerely want to save the country, then I hope that you will first escort the chairman out of Shaanxi with courtesy, and then ask the central government to decide on your views after public discussion. In doing so, you and others can show that you have no other intentions, and the country can expect to win. Your telegram said that you deeply wish the chairman to be the savior and great man of the Chinese nation for all ages. I also wish you to be a sincere hero who saves the country, not a sinner who commits treason and rebellion and destroys the country. Our relationship with the chairman is like sharing joys and sorrows, and our survival is intertwined. My relationship with you is not shallow either, so I dare to offer my loyal advice. I hope you will take it to heart. Liu Zhi, seal." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News from Beiping: Yang Yunshi telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 16th, asking him to follow the hearts of the people of the country and do his best to rescue Chairman Chiang from danger. The original telegram stated, "You must know that if Chairman Chiang's life is safe for one day, then you are also safe for one day. If there is no Chairman Chiang, then it will be your end. If you do not repent of your mistakes, your demise is near. The national crisis is so serious, and news of a great victory on the border has just been reported. If this disrupts the government's plans, emboldens the ambitions of treacherous elements, destroys the achievements of generals and soldiers, and plunges the people into a state of suffering, then China will surely blame you for a great sorrow for all ages, and how will history write about you?"

The original telegram stated, "To Army Commander Feng Qinzai of the 42nd Army in Dali County, Shaanxi, The Xi'an Incident has aroused the indignation of the whole country. The safety of the chairman is tied to the security of the world and the survival of the nation. Who are they that they dare to offend his dignity and isolate themselves from the people of the country? The news has been heart-wrenching. You, my brother, have a profound understanding of righteousness and serve as the mainstay in the torrents, refusing to obey rebellious orders and showing the steadfastness of pine and cypress. Your great wisdom and courage shine throughout the world. Looking forward to the clouds over Shaanxi, I am overjoyed. However, a major disaster has occurred, and a major change has taken place. How to rescue the chairman and how to quell the rebellion? You, my brother, are nearby and must work hard to achieve this unprecedented feat. I am waiting for orders, ready to be your backup.

<h3>Zhang Abets Soldiers to Tolerate Bandits: Order for Investigation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Xi'an Incident, the Ministry of Justice stated that Zhang Xueliang and others had betrayed the Party and the country, abetted soldiers to tolerate bandits, and committed murder and arson in the area, which is not tolerated by national law. It ordered the Supreme Court Procuratorate to order its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation and prosecution, and to punish the lawless elements to the fullest extent of the law. The original text of the Supreme Court Procuratorate's report to the Ministry of Justice is recorded below. It states, "The Ministry's Instructions No. 6859 state that the Xi'an Incident is being investigated by the National Government, and that high officials have been sent to lead troops to punish the rebels. The military and civilians are deeply angered by the rebels' betrayal of the Party, the country, and the army, and the abetting of soldiers to tolerate bandits, murder, and arson is not tolerated by national law. It is reported that a large number of people in the Xi'an area have been killed by them, and it is urgent to rectify the law and discipline to maintain the foundation of the country and pacify the local area. Therefore, the procurator general is ordered to supervise his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that the treacherous elements are punished to the fullest extent of the law, in order to fulfill the responsibility of protecting the country and restoring order. It is also necessary to report the investigation progress at any time. It is hereby ordered, etc. Upon receiving this, it is found that the incident involves ordinary criminal charges and should be automatically investigated by the procuratorial powers. We have received the aforementioned order and have ordered the chief prosecutors of the high courts of the neighboring provinces of Jin, Chuan, Yu, Sui, Gan, and Ning to follow the instructions, handle the matter carefully and seriously, and report the handling progress at any time. In addition to continuing to supervise the handling of the matter and reporting, we hereby submit this report for your review." (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Proclamation by the Central Propaganda Department: A Letter to the Northwest Anti-Communist Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department issued a "Letter to the Northwest Anti-Communist Soldiers" on the 20th. The full text is as follows: "Our anti-communist soldiers in Shaanxi and Gansu, over the years, you have been working hard in the Northwest, shouldering the task of suppressing the communist bandits, charging into battle, and advancing one after another, finally causing the rampant communist bandits to fall into a total collapse. Although a small number of communist remnants are still scurrying around, they are like fish in a pot, at the end of their rope, and their inevitable total annihilation is only a matter of time. We think of you fighting bravely in the cold and frozen Northwest, killing bandits, such a heroic spirit of sacrifice will naturally have its great value in the national history in the future. Your great achievements are unanimously admired and appreciated by the people of the whole country. Unexpectedly, at this time when the communist atmosphere is about to be cleared, Zhang Xueliang, who is burdened with the important task of suppressing bandits, actually rebelled in Xi'an and kidnapped the commander-in-chief. When the news came, it was like a bolt from the blue. The people of the country were filled with righteous indignation and sent telegrams to condemn him. However, the rebel Zhang still did not show any sign of repentance. Now the central government has issued a clear order to dismiss and punish the rebel Zhang. After this incident, our anti-communist soldiers, far away on the frontier, must also be filled with sorrow and indignation at the rebellion of the rebel Zhang. You all know that suppressing the communists, resisting foreign aggression, securing the country internally, and expelling foreign enemies are the established national policies of the central government in recent years, and they are also the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. Although the external troubles are extremely serious today, it is absolutely impossible to resist foreign aggression, avenge humiliation, save the country, and seek survival without unified steps and an orderly front. The crimes of the communist bandits are not only in destroying social organizations, but also in selling out the interests of the entire nation. During the defense of Shanghai, they disrupted the rear and restrained the national army. During the defense of the Great Wall, they harassed the Northwest and fueled the enemy's flames. On the surface, they and the puppet bandits are 'incompatible in principle,' but in reality, they are completely in collusion, reaching the same destination by different routes. Therefore, suppressing the communists and resisting foreign aggression is the most important task for saving the country at present, especially the work of suppressing the communists, which must be intensified to concentrate the power of the whole country and accomplish the great mission of resisting foreign aggression and avenging humiliation. This is what our anti-bandit soldiers should clearly understand. Chairman Chiang is the only leader of the party and the country today, and the only savior of the Chinese nation at present. For ten years, he has presided over the central government, advised on national affairs, and has not had time for a moment of peace. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been working hard. Remarkable progress has been made in internal affairs, diplomacy, national economy, and people's livelihood, enabling our scattered and chaotic situation to enter a new stage of modern nationhood. The perception of our country by all countries in the world has also changed. This great achievement is entirely due to the leadership of Chairman Chiang, so his safety is entrusted to our entire Chinese nation. Only by unanimously and absolutely supporting Chairman Chiang can we achieve the goal of resisting foreign aggression, avenging humiliation, and reviving the nation. The rebellion of the rebel Zhang and the kidnapping of the leader have not only filled our people with grief and indignation, but have also shocked the world. Even Soviet public opinion has strongly criticized Zhang's actions, denouncing them as harmful to the country and the people, which shows that justice and right and wrong are in the hearts of the people, and all countries have the same feeling. Our Northwest soldiers, under the direct leadership of Chairman Chiang, have shared weal and woe for several years. Regarding Chairman Chiang's predicament, we should express more righteous indignation and show more sincerity, and continue to make the greatest efforts for the work of suppressing bandits, and eradicate the major hidden dangers for the country and the nation. Now the work of suppressing bandits has reached the final stage, and full success will soon be achieved. At this time, all of you soldiers, please adhere to the established national policies of the central government, strictly abide by the guidelines instructed by Chairman Chiang, intensify your work, and eliminate the remaining bandits. The more bandits you kill, the more harm you eliminate for the country; the more bandit areas you recover, the more suffering you relieve for the people; and the more strength you contribute to the nation and the country. Do not let the Xi'an Incident and the temporary predicament of the leader affect the progress of the anti-bandit military operations. Now the rebel Zhang is guilty of heinous crimes, abandoned by all, and will soon be completely annihilated under the attack of the central government's army. This can be a comforting message to all of you soldiers. At the same time, we believe that the remaining communist bandits in the Northwest, under your intensified encirclement and suppression, can certainly be eliminated soon. After the work of suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the communists is completed, we can unite the whole country and work together for the great task of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and reviving the nation. Our party government and the people of the whole country are eagerly awaiting the news of your victory in pacifying the communist bandits. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)"</p>

<h3>Trial of Wang Jingwei Assassination Case Transferred to Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Wang Jingwei assassination case is scheduled to be heard on the 25th at the Capital District Court. The presiding judge, Wu Yuheng, and others, are scheduled to come to Beijing on the 20th to review the case files and decide on the trial procedure. It is reported that Yu Likui's profession is murder, and he has repeatedly committed murder cases. The prosecutor has decided to prosecute him for the crime of murder under ordinary criminal law. Zhang Yuhua and others are also prosecuted for the crime of murder under ordinary criminal law. The Fifth Branch of the Suzhou Court believes that since the case has been prosecuted under ordinary criminal law, it is no longer within its jurisdiction. Therefore, the coming of the presiding judge to Beijing to hold a trial will be a judgment of jurisdictional error. The entire case will be transferred to the Capital District Court, which has jurisdiction, according to law. Subsequently, after the case falls under the jurisdiction of the court with jurisdiction, the entire case will need to be retried. However, the litigation procedures already carried out by the Fifth Branch of the High Court will not lose their effectiveness, so the trial will continue after the transfer of jurisdiction.

<p>Special Dispatch from Suiyuan</p>
<h3>A Record of Comforting Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Bi De</p>
<p>In the two decisive battles of Honggeertu and Bailingmiao, although the Mongolian puppet bandit army suffered great losses, our anti-enemy soldiers also suffered many casualties. The corpses of the deceased have been transported back to Gui Sui and a memorial service has been held. The wounded have also been continuously transported to the rear in military vehicles and are being treated in rear hospitals. There are three rear hospitals, all located in the urban area of Gui Sui City, one in the Liangshan Street Provincial Fourth Elementary School, one in the Xiaodong Street Chuanji Hospital, and one in the First Military Station Barracks near the station. There is also the Public Hospital, a charitable organization, where a portion of the wounded soldiers are also quartered.</p>
<p>In recent days, comfort groups from various places have arrived in Gui Sui, such as the Qinghua University War Zone Service Group, the Chaoyang College Comfort Group, the Shandong Senior High School Comfort Group, the Northeast University Comfort Group, etc., all of which have sent representatives to visit the wounded soldiers in various wounded soldier hospitals. On the afternoon of the 14th, the reporter also accompanied Ye Wenqin and Wang Jinghuan, representatives of the Beiping Student Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War Support Association, to visit the Liangshan Street, Xiaodong Street, and First Military Station hospitals, and investigated the living conditions of the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>We first went to the Xiaodong Street wounded soldier hospital, where we were received by Mr. Chen, the person in charge of the hospital, and led to the various light and serious illness wards for visits. First, we visited the ward downstairs. Mr. Ye, the representative of Beiping students, gave a brief speech of condolence. Every wounded soldier listened attentively, and gratitude appeared on everyone's face. Several of the seriously ill were lying in bed, only opening their eyes to stare at the people offering condolences. In the second ward downstairs, there was a soldier whose right leg had been blown off. When I was taking a picture of him, he even asked someone to pull open the quilt covering him, implying that I should also include his broken leg in the photo. I was greatly moved at the time. I understood the intention of this heroic soldier with a broken leg. I understood that he was not trying to show his heroism with his broken leg, but to use it to tell our fellow countrymen in the rear, so that our fellow countrymen in the rear would know that there are many great soldiers on the front line sacrificing their legs, their arms, and even their lives for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>On the bed next to this soldier with a broken leg, there was also a soldier whose right arm had been injured by a bomb. He seemed to be without any pain. His face was glowing with a strange luster, and he was naturally answering the questions of a person offering condolences who had been there earlier. Leaving this ward, we were led upstairs by the leader, where there were all light patients. There was only one compatriot with half of his face damaged. He was injured by enemy bullets in the Battle of Honggeertu. He was lying alone in a small ward, appearing very lonely and painful. We rushed to offer him condolences, and when we explained that we wanted to take a picture of him, he struggled to try to sit up. We hurriedly stopped him, and he lay down peacefully, allowing us to capture this tragic image in the camera. It is a pity that the light was insufficient, and the photos that were developed were not entirely beautiful.</p>
<p>After the visit was over, we each received a reply from the wounded soldiers of the Jin Sui Anti-Bandit Army, one section of which said: "We believe that only by using hot blood to toast the enemy can we win back the nation's personality and the nation's survival. Therefore, although we are now slightly injured, we are not in pain. On the contrary, we feel particularly comforted in our spirit. As long as the injury is slightly better, we will return to the front line and fight the enemy desperately."</p>
<p>Leaving the Xiaodong Street wounded soldier hospital, we rushed to the Fourth Elementary School wounded soldier hospital. The director of this hospital is Yun Hanzhang, a major military doctor, a fat man who seems to be a very capable middle-aged man. He invited us to sit in his bedroom for a while, smoked a cigarette, and drank a few cups of green tea. We asked him how many wounded soldiers there were here, in which battle they were injured, and how many had been discharged from the hospital. He said, "There are currently only fifty wounded soldiers here. More than a dozen have already been discharged from the hospital. Most of those living here were injured during the attack on Bailingmiao, and most of those in Xiaodong Street were injured in the Battle of Honggeertu." He also said, "There are more than two hundred wounded soldiers in the whole of Gui Sui." Mr. Ye, the representative of Beiping students, asked him what the wounded soldier hospital was currently lacking, and what comforting items or supplies and medicines the people in the rear should send. The director replied: "What the hospital needs are medical cotton and bandages, etc., but most of these things are already very complete. As for biscuits and fruits, etc., there is no need to send them, because the injured do not necessarily need these things." After saying that, he instructed a nurse-like person to tell the wounded soldiers that there were representatives coming to offer condolences. After a while, he led us to visit each ward one by one. The wards here are all converted from the classrooms of the Fourth Elementary School, so they are clean and ventilated, and the light is relatively sufficient. However, one thing is worth noting: every wounded soldier is covered with an extremely neat quilt. They sleep inside the quilt, exposing their faces outside, and their faces show an uncomfortable look. I thought to myself that there must be some secret in Director You asking the nurse to notify the wounded soldiers. Maybe he forced every wounded soldier to cover himself with this heavy quilt, regardless of whether you need it or not. Naturally, I hope that my guess is wrong. If this is really the case, ignoring the needs of the wounded soldiers and only caring about the appearance of neatness, then that would be too wrong. In this way, it will only make every wounded soldier feel that the arrival of the comfort group is bringing them pain, making them have to pretend to be unnatural and peaceful, and suffer unwanted oppression.</p>
<p>Leaving the wounded soldier hospital of the Fourth Elementary School, it was already four o'clock in the afternoon. We prepared rickshaws to go to the station to visit many soldiers under Wang Ying's command who were injured in Bailingmiao. These young Chinese people, who had once done the most shameful thing under the lure of temporary desire, were grateful for the extremely generous treatment. Most of these young people are poor farmers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Henan provinces, who took this dead end only because they were driven by hunger. Some of them are old people from Shangdu County. Wang Ying pulled their horses and forced them to participate in the war, so they had no choice but to participate. They all expressed great excitement, saying that they had now left the tiger's mouth. Although they were slightly injured, their spirits and bodies were already very comfortable and free.

<h3>Large Quantities of Propaganda Distributed in the Air Over Xi'an and Surrounding Areas to Promote the Awakening of Those Who Have Joined the Rebellion and to Educate the People. The Effect Is No Less Than That of Airplanes Dropping Bombs.</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Since the Xi'an Incident occurred on the 13th, airplanes have been going to the front line for reconnaissance and bombing. The rebel army is extremely panicked. In particular, the distribution of leaflets, pamphlets, and newspapers by airplanes has had the greatest effect. In terms of written propaganda by the Central Propaganda Department, in addition to the leaflets and pamphlets printed by itself, all telegrams from the heads of various agencies and various social, academic, and news organizations are widely collected and reprinted into various leaflets, and compiled into volumes. Important newspapers from Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Hangzhou, and other ports are purchased and printed every day and sent by airplane to Xi'an and various counties in Shaanxi and Gansu to promote the awakening of those who have joined the rebellion and to educate the general public. According to the airplane pilots, the effect is no less than that of bombs dropped by airplanes. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

Everyone with blood and energy loves and supports him. However, the rebels Zhang Xueliang, etc., indulged in the wild ambitions of wolves, followed the old ways of warlords, and at the time when the remaining bandits were about to be wiped out and the report of victory was received, they defied the great disapproval of the world, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, betrayed the party and the country, and were so insane. Now the central government has issued a clear order to punish them. It is expected that the fighting will point to them, and the evil atmosphere will be completely eliminated. Our police colleagues throughout the country have long been influenced by the leader and deeply share the righteous indignation. We are responsible for securing the country internally and regret that we cannot take up arms and personally eliminate these villains. We will certainly strictly follow the central government's decisions, strive to stabilize the rear, ensure that rumors are eliminated and people's hearts are calmed, relieve the government's worries, and destroy the evil spirits of the traitors.

Recently, a telegram was sent to Zhang Xueliang, the rebel, stating: "Since the September 18th Incident, due to your incompetence and absurdity, and your failure to resist, the four northeastern provinces were lost, opening up a strange shame and humiliation unprecedented in our country's history. In order to preserve the nation's strength, the Central Government has been lenient and fully considerate, hoping to leave a lasting effect. However, you have failed to repay this kindness and have actually taken advantage of the central government's active resistance against the invading bandits to kidnap the supreme commander and launch a mutiny, plunging the nation and the people into an abyss of eternal destruction. When the news spread, the entire country was shocked and angered. The entire city of Guiyang held a mass rally today and unanimously resolved to support the central government, rescue the leader, and suppress the rebels. We urge you to quickly and respectfully return the leader to Beijing and beg for forgiveness. Otherwise, the people of the entire country will swear to never coexist with such an enemy and will surely kill you. We express our indignation and hope you will quickly repent." We hope that everyone will rise up together and suppress this thief. This telegram is sent for your information and consideration. The Guiyang City Citizens' Assembly kowtows."</p>
<p>Telegram from Hangzhou: To Commander-in-Chief He Jingzhi of Nanjing, Commander-in-Chief Liu Jingfu of Kaifeng, and Commander-in-Chief Gu Mosan of Guiyang, Respectfully, your telegram has been received with reverence. Zhang, the rebel, has been in mutiny for more than a week, and the entire country is filled with righteous indignation. Now that national unification has been achieved and the nation's position is gradually being restored, that villain, as a military general, has received great favor from the country, yet he dares to collude with the Red bandits and spread heretical ideas, sacrificing the country and the people to achieve his wild ambitions. No wicked person in history has been this ruthless. Sirs, you are revitalizing the army and receiving orders to advance and suppress. Wherever the banner of righteousness points, the seas will follow. With the spirit of the late Premier Sun in Heaven, the leader can surely be protected from danger, the rebel leader can be beheaded, the people's hearts can be gladdened, the rebellious atmosphere can be contained, and the Party and the nation can be established. Following in your wake, there is no greater piety in prayer. I respectfully express my sincere heart and wish you victory and peace. Zhu Jia Hua kowtows, Jia Yin.</p>
<p>Telegram from Chengdu: To all newspapers, for your inspection. The Xi'an Incident has occurred, shocking the world and causing profound grief. The strong neighbors are celebrating, and the country's situation is as precarious as an egg in the wind. Xiang, as the commander of a partial force and also in charge of Sichuan's administration, uses the overall situation to measure and balance, and the grief and emotion are overwhelming. He respectfully presents his views in this telegram, hoping to invite your insight. He believes that there are measures that cannot be delayed in order to mend the situation. He humbly presents his limited views for the judgment of the wise: (1) In recent years, the efforts of the upper and lower levels of our country have gradually brought order to a chaotic situation, forming a strong and capable government with a basic national framework. The international community's recognition of this major change requires everyone to do their utmost and sacrifice everything to consolidate the central institutions and make them sound, organized, strong, and powerful. If everyone acts on their own, it will inevitably lead to national division and allow the strong neighbors to succeed. No province, region, or faction can survive. It is hoped that the military and political colleagues in all provinces will unite and do their utmost to support the central government in order to seek the integrity of the nation. (2) The strong neighbors' encroachment has continued unabated. They will not change their policy of subjugating our country based on who our leader is. Since our country has been caught off guard, they will use this as a golden opportunity to accelerate their actions of taking advantage of the chaos and humiliating our country. It is hoped that the military and political colleagues in all provinces will unite their strength, overcome all difficulties, and, under the leadership of the jointly supported central government, bravely risk death to resist foreign aggression. (3) For many years, the people of our country have been constantly aware of the urgency of foreign aggression and have never forgotten the desire to resist aggression and avenge humiliation. Although there may be differences in the urgency of proposals and biases in views, the determination to love the country and resist the enemy is equally strong. However, the Xi'an Incident has dealt a great blow to our work of resisting aggression and saving the country. It is hoped that the military and political colleagues in all provinces will support the central government and stabilize the overall situation in order to seek the survival of our country and people. (4) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has worked hard and made great achievements and should be respected and loved by the military and civilians of the whole country. In today's situation of intertwined domestic and foreign troubles, he is an even more indispensable leader for the military and civilians of the whole country. To lose his freedom is enough to undermine the nation's determination to resist the enemy, strengthen the enemy's will to invade, break internal unity, and eliminate external strength. Saving the country in this way will only hasten its demise. Those who have kidnapped him should also realize the difficulty of the days to come and recognize that what they have done is wrong. It is hoped that the central authorities and colleagues in all provinces will quickly devise effective solutions, promote the kidnappers' awakening, and restore the leader's freedom so that he can continue to exercise his powers and complete the work of resisting aggression and saving the country. Special telegram, waiting for your wise guidance. Liu Xiang kowtows, Qiao Wei Yin.</p>
<p>Telegram from Guanzhong: To all newspapers, for your public inspection. Zhang Xueliang is a sinner of the Republic of China for all time. Originating from a bandit warlord, with the nature of a bandit, he once disturbed Hebei and Shandong and then wreaked havoc in Liaodong. He was addicted to drugs, regarding them as his life, and lost four provinces by not resisting. Yet he shamelessly existed in the world, taking advantage of opportunities. The central government, considering his youth, treated him kindly and entrusted him with a position of responsibility and heavy troops. Who knew that instead of hearing the song of victory, he would create a disaster within the walls, holding superiors hostage and insulting colleagues, wanting to use the old trick of losing the Northeast to lose Shaanxi and Gansu. He is deranged, truly worse than a beast, and a disgrace to humanity. We uphold the national principles and will act swiftly, like eagles chasing magpies, daring not to lag behind. Our central government is not the central government of one person, but the central government of the whole country. Mutilating the elders and insulting the father, what can be tolerated if this cannot be tolerated? We urge the central government to issue a clear order to Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin to select six armies and openly launch a punitive expedition. We will brave fire and water and will not hesitate. Ten thousand troops will block him to the west in Xianyang, Fan's army will seal his mouth in Tongguan, and our army will block him to the north by the river. The fish in the pot, why wait for the pot to be heated? We deeply hope that our government and the public will distinguish between right and wrong and unanimously denounce him. Commander of the 7th Army Feng Qin Zai, Commander of the 46th Army Fan Songfu, Commander of the 6th Division Zhou Gu, Commander of the 10th Division Li Mo An, Commander of the 28th Division Dong Zhao, Commander of the 60th Division Chen Pei, Commander of the Training Corps of the Military Academy Gui Minqing, Commander of the 79th Division Chen Anbao, all kowtow, Han Hai Yin.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Glimmer of Hope in the Current Situation</h3>
<p>—Yi</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred on the 12th of this month, the emotions of grief and indignation throughout the country have surged to the extreme. At the same time, international public opinion has also expressed great unease. However, recently, a glimmer of hope has gradually appeared amidst the treacherous gloom. Firstly, the prestige of the central government has been further enhanced due to the issuance of the punitive order and the response of public opinion throughout the country. Secondly, military personnel from various provinces have successively telegraphed, expressing their support for the central government. Recently, President Yu was ordered to enter Shaanxi to offer comfort. Feng Qin Zai and other generals stationed in Shaanxi have also telegraphed again, vowing to die in the suppression of Zhang. Under these circumstances, Zhang Xueliang's isolation and desperation are imaginable. Thirdly, the safety and freedom of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are the issues of greatest concern to the people of the country. However, since Donner and Chiang Ting-wen arrived in the capital, we can be sure about the safety. And Song Ziwen's recent arrival in Shaanxi has further increased the possibility of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's escape. Fourthly, newspapers around the world, regardless of their political stance, have unanimously expressed praise and sympathy for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This kind of international public opinion is enough to enhance Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's prestige and can also promote Zhang Xueliang's awakening.</p>
<p>From these points, we can know that the enormous disaster caused by Zhang Xueliang can be resolved in the shortest possible time, no matter what. This trend is not only determined by the national public opinion but also by the international situation. Why? Because the Xi'an Incident involves the safety of the highest military and political leader in China and clearly has world significance. Today's China is moving towards the path of self-reliance and unification. If the strength of China's unification and resistance to aggression is reduced due to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's insecurity, it will naturally be a matter of concern to all countries that care about world peace. The London Times, the organ of the British Conservative Party, criticized the incident, saying, "This is a bold conspiracy, a 'theatrical coup'... If the central government cannot resolve this matter quickly, the changes in the future are unpredictable and beyond our speculation." Even the Soviet Union, which Zhang Xueliang unilaterally considered a confidant, expressed great aversion to the Xi'an Incident. The Moscow Pravda said the other day, "Zhang Xueliang's rebellion proves that he is a tool of Japanese imperialism." The day before yesterday, Soviet Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Spi Rivani visited Foreign Minister Zhang, expressing the Soviet government's attitude towards the Xi'an Incident, saying, "The Soviet government believes that Zhang Xueliang's actions will only undermine China's unification and reduce China's strength." The attitude of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union is like this. The attitudes of other countries, except for those with aggressive ambitions, are also like this. The reason why they hate Zhang Xueliang's actions is because they are undermining China's unification and stability. In today's world, China is still a great force for maintaining peace. To ensure the survival of the nation, the Chinese people naturally need unification and stability. To maintain world peace, the majority of countries in the world also demand China's unification and stability. In such an era, any actions that undermine China's unification and stability are naturally doomed to fail.</p>

<h3>East Asia Same Culture Association Expands its Organization, Fumimaro Konoe Appointed Chairman, Seeks Sino-Japanese Cultural Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The East Asia Same Culture Association, a foundation, has had its longtime chairman, Nobuaki Makino, resign due to illness, as he contributed to Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings. Fumimaro Konoe, who has had a deep relationship with the association since his predecessor, was recommended to succeed him. The new chairman, Konoe, recognizes the importance of Sino-Japanese relations and the mission of the association. He is taking this opportunity to expand the association's organization and has newly recommended Nobuko Oku, a viscountess, as the managing director of the association.

<h3>Germany to Expand Outward, Fu to Have New Moves, Urging Hungarian Minorities to Cause Internal Strife in Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>(Paris) Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic reporter for the Business Daily, recently declared that German government officials had recently considered taking action against Czechoslovakia in order to achieve their plan to expand outward. But "the country has no intention of direct action, but will act through Hungary. According to the planned plan, the Hungarian minority in Czechoslovakia will first launch an attack, and then the famous Sudeten German Party led by the German Henlein will rise up in response. At that time, a civil war will inevitably break out in Czechoslovakia, and Germany will not have to worry about having no excuse to intervene." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Actively Implements Four-Year Economic Plan, Göring Rebukes in Harsh Tone Due to Poor Performance by the Business Community</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Air Minister and "Four-Year Plan Dictator" General Göring convened a secret meeting last Thursday, attended by 300 people, including senior officials from government agencies, top officials from the "Four-Year Plan," and representatives from the Army Ministry's Economic Division, but Economic Minister and Central Bank President Schacht did not attend. The details of the meeting were extremely confidential. Today, the government issued a public statement saying only that 300 key figures from the business community had held a meeting, during which Führer Hitler and Göring gave speeches, elaborating on the key points of the Four-Year Plan from the perspective of the state, lasting four hours. However, it is rumored that Göring declared at the meeting that Germany must immediately implement industrial mobilization, which surprised those in attendance. In addition, Göring rebuked some members of the business community in a harsh tone, saying that they had not performed well in implementing the Four-Year Plan and that everyone had a patriotic duty and should not be negligent. The main purpose of the Four-Year Plan is to enable Germany to cope with difficult national crises, which cannot be compared to routine official duties. "For example, if someone can obtain rubber for me, no matter what method is used, even if it violates the rules and disregards all orders, I will not only not punish them but will also reward them." Göring continued, saying that all raw materials needed for armaments are important. Finally, regarding the Spanish incident, he said that the German Nazi authorities are determined to see General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish National Army, win. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>To Maintain the Mediterranean Situation, British-Italian Agreement to Be Established Soon, To Be Adopted by Exchange of Documents, Not Involving the Issue of Annexing Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is expected that before the end of the year, Britain and Italy will be able to reach a Mediterranean compromise. The diplomatic community regards this as a "Christmas gift" from the two governments. This compromise may be completed by the two countries exchanging documents to ensure the maintenance of the current situation in the Mediterranean. This compromise is only related to the Mediterranean and does not involve the British recognition of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, nor does it contain provisions restricting the navy, and it does not directly mention Spain. The public intends to guarantee the maintenance of the current situation in the Mediterranean, which can dispel the doubts of the country that wants to seize one of the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean from Spain. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) People related to the Foreign Office recently declared that it is too early to say that the signing of the gentleman's agreement on the Mediterranean issue between Britain and Italy is imminent. The Italian attitude towards the Mediterranean and whether the gentleman's agreement can encounter a crisis due to the Spanish civil war are being supplemented by Italy. Therefore, the signing must be postponed. As for changing the British legation in Abyssinia to a consulate-general, the time for resolution seems not far away. Generally, the two parties should reach an agreement at the beginning of next year. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany Sends Troops to Spain: Britain Issues a Serious Warning; Ribbentrop Visits Eden Before Returning Home, Insists on Expanding the Scope of the Non-Intervention Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) It is learned today that German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop is about to return home to personally report to Hitler on Britain's attitude towards non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Reliable sources say that Foreign Secretary Eden warned Ribbentrop today that Britain is paying close attention to Germany's dispatch of "volunteer soldiers" to Spain to assist in the war. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" also stated that Germany has sent regular troops to the West, these troops are called volunteer armies, in fact they are the Sixth Grenade Company of the 13th Infantry Division stationed in Westphalia. It is said that Ribbentrop replied to Eden, "If all countries can act in unison, Germany can also temporarily suspend sending troops to the West, but it is necessary to expand the scope of the non-intervention agreement to prohibit any economic assistance to any party in Spain, as there are rumors that Russia and France are taking such actions." The British side seems dissatisfied with Ribbentrop's reply, as expanding the scope of the non-intervention agreement may put French Prime Minister Blum in a difficult position domestically. (Nineteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Before returning home yesterday, German Ambassador Ribbentrop visited Foreign Secretary Eden at the Foreign Office. Many newspapers here have attached great importance to this. Diplomatic circles have expressed surprise, believing that after the ambassador returns home, he will definitely meet with officials of the German Foreign Ministry before the Christmas holiday. Therefore, it is normal for him to visit Foreign Secretary Eden before his departure to inquire about certain points of British foreign policy. During their meeting yesterday, Eden reiterated Britain's attitude regarding the Spanish civil strife and Britain's obligations to the European continent, in accordance with past statements. German sources in London have offered the same explanation for Ribbentrop's visit to Eden yesterday, believing that although Eden expressed to the ambassador that Britain attaches great importance to the issue of prohibiting volunteers from joining the Western countries, because the ambassador is about to return home to consult with the responsible authorities in his country, it is difficult to immediately provide a response regarding Germany's views on this matter. These sources also said that, regarding this matter, the German delegation to the Non-Intervention Committee on Spanish Affairs has consistently insisted that the issue of volunteers joining the Western countries must be prohibited at the same time as other indirect intervention methods (i.e., fundraising and propaganda), and cannot be resolved separately.

<h3>The Mist Clears in Spain, and the War Becomes Active Again; Rebel Troops Advance Towards the Capital in Several Directions; Fierce Battles Occur on the Northwestern Front</h3>
<p>Madrid Since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, it has been six months. Left-wing troops still occupy the largest city and the most prosperous regions in the country. General Franco's right-wing troops occupy the provinces of Galicia, Andalusia, Castile, and Aragon. The heavy fog of yesterday has now dissipated, and government troops, fearing that rebel aircraft will bomb again, are heavily shelling rebel lines with artillery. An unconfirmed report says that two rebel units are advancing through the snow, intending to meet outside Madrid, but government troops there are also preparing to resist. (Nineteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid The fiercest battles in the northwestern province of Asturias are currently taking place in the area between the city of Villablino and the town of Gradaladar. Villablino is a key location for the rebel forces, while Gradaladar is strategically important for controlling the city of Oviedo (the capital of Asturias). All food and military supplies transported to Oviedo must pass through this town, making it strategically important. The two sides clashed in the area last Friday, and the intensity was extreme, with both sides' artillery units particularly active. After fierce fighting, government troops immediately advanced. Although the Nationalist forces used 24 aircraft to assist in the battle, government troops eventually captured many of the town's houses and immediately dug trenches to establish defenses to secure their position.

<p>Madrid A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that yesterday, taking advantage of the dense fog, the Nationalist forces launched an offensive near the San Fernando Bridge in the University District of the western suburbs.

At the same time, the Nationalist forces once attacked the town of Pozuelo in the northern suburbs, but were also unsuccessful. As for the area along the Tagus River, although battles occurred between the two sides, the positions remained unchanged. The above all occurred yesterday.

Among them, there were 1,500 infantry and 500 cavalry in the town of Villanueva, 1,000 infantry in the town of Valdargana, and three battalions of infantry in the town of Villaviciosa. After receiving the news, government troops immediately opened fire on these villages and towns to prevent the Nationalist forces from advancing. (Nineteenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Avila (In the hands of the Nationalist forces) A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that yesterday the weather cleared up, making it favorable for combat. The troops of General Mola, commander of the Nationalist forces in the north, occupied the town of Villanueva de la Cañada at noon. The town is located on the highway from Brunete to El Escorial, west of the capital, and is only 20 kilometers away from the famous monastery of El Escorial. The Nationalist forces immediately took advantage of their victory and advanced about seven kilometers to the north. Some units were ordered to stay behind to consolidate their occupied positions. The remaining units could have continued to advance, but the supply convoy got lost along the way and mistakenly entered the government forces' combat zone, so they had to temporarily halt their advance. It was not until the supply convoy returned in the evening that these units continued to advance. In addition, Nationalist aircraft bombed the government forces' fortresses in the province of Aragon, northeast of Madrid, yesterday, while government aircraft circled and inspected behind the Nationalist forces' defense line under General Varela. The Nationalist forces used anti-aircraft guns to shoot down two government fighter planes in the town of Navalcarnero. (Twentieth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Certain Party's Actions in Southern Fujian: Large-Scale Purchase of Discarded Fishing Nets and Old Cotton; Nationalists Still Invade the Interior; Huang Guotai Exploited by Certain Party</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, in preparation for coping with the so-called emergency period, a certain country's military industry is developing rapidly. Recently, they sent people to Xiamen to purchase old fishing nets discarded by fishermen and broken cotton quilts and cotton batting from civilians along the coast of southern Fujian, as well as "jiaoding chai" (a type of seaweed) produced on the coast of southern Fujian. Moreover, they are purchasing them on a large scale. It is said that they are used to manufacture military chemical industrial products. In the case of old fishing nets alone, hundreds of thousands of catties have recently been shipped for export. On the 15th of this month, the "Guangdong Maru" exported 10,272 kilograms to Taiwan, valued at more than 500 yuan, according to official reports to customs. The export of old cotton quilts, cotton batting, and jiaoding chai has not been reported to customs, so it is impossible to statistically determine the quantity. However, the purchase in the interior of southern Fujian has been very urgent in recent days. The price of each old cotton quilt is one to two yuan. The collection of the above three items is done by enticing ordinary ignorant people to guide purchases or collect them on their behalf.</p>
<p>Nationalists of a certain country are still very active in their invasion of the interior of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. They mostly disguise themselves as overseas Chinese from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, posing as small vendors or medicine sellers. They mostly reside in Heshan outside Xiamen, Shishi in Quanzhou, and Shima in Zhangzhou, with Heshan and Shishi being the most common. Shishi is the central location for smuggling goods into the Quanzhou area. Nationalists of a certain country have long been colluding with local bad elements. Since Cai Peiqing, Cai Huo, and Tian Baohua were executed one after another, their followers are still scattered in the villages outside the south gate and Tumenshi of Quanzhou. Therefore, nationalists of a certain country mostly move here to live together, believing that they have something to rely on. Heshan is located in the suburbs of Xiamen, making it even more convenient for nationalists of a certain country to move in. Moreover, they mostly impersonate our country's nationals and purchase land. Shima in the Zhangzhou area is the center of nationalists of a certain country, causing harm to the three counties of Longxi, Haicheng, and Zhangpu. Local bandits with a certain country's backing, such as Huang Guotai, command several small groups of bandits. Although the total number is less than 200, they are extremely vicious and their influence reaches as far as Xiamen. Last month, troops stationed in Xiamen raided a certain country's nationals' residence twice, uncovering their organization. The troops stationed in Zhangzhou have recently been adopting a policy of both suppression and appeasement towards bandits in the Zhangzhou area. There are no longer any large or small groups of bandits, except for Huang Guotai and his subordinates, who refuse to be incorporated. On the 14th, troops stationed in Haicheng attacked Huang Guotai's bandit nest in Dongdai, rescuing 11 hostages. Huang Guotai, Huang Hedong, and Zhang Fei fled. The troops then searched the bandit nest and found forged documents and a fake official seal, as well as details of the bandit organization. Huang Guotai is the fake commander, Huang Hedong is the fake commander of the first brigade, Zhang Baoxian is the fake commander of the second brigade, Peng Hedong is the fake commander of the third brigade, and Huang Chuangsheng is the commander of an independent company. The troops are currently searching and suppressing them to prevent them from being exploited by a certain country and causing harm to the local area.</p>

We are endlessly anticipating and praying for you. We send this letter to convey our condolences and hope you will understand. We also wish you peace."</p>
<p>In addition, Beijing Mayor Ma Chaojun sent a telegram to Commanders Liu Gu asking them to quickly sweep away the rebellious atmosphere. The original text is as follows: "Generals Liu Jingfu and Gu Bisheng, Commanders of the East and West Route Army Groups of the Punitive Expedition in Kaifeng and Guiyang, the Xi'an Incident has caused anxiety and panic throughout the country. Quickly sweep away the gloom and launch a punitive expedition. Now the Central Government has a definite policy for suppressing the rebellion and pacifying the country.

We look forward to you displaying your divine power and demonstrating your wisdom, supervising the advance of the large army to suppress and quickly destroy the rebels, sweeping away the decadent and pulling down the rotten. The Chairman's safe escape from danger and the pacification of the rebels on a daily basis depend on your control of the odds and the gathering of great assistance. We, the people of the capital, under the leadership of the Chairman, have felt deeply shocked and indignant upon hearing of this incident. We all have the determination to kill the rebels and vow to be your support. The national lifeline and the foundation of the country depend on it. This telegram conveys our urgency and endless prayers. Your younger brother Ma Chaojun bows respectfully."</p>

<h3>Suzhou: Shi Liang Has Not Yet Surrendered</h3>
<p>After Shanghai Bar Association Standing Committee Member Shen Junru and others were transferred from Shanghai to Suzhou and detained in the Jiangsu Higher Court Detention Branch, many of Shen's relatives and friends have come to Suzhou to visit them in recent days.

<p>The Fujian Provincial political and banking circles organized a Taiwan inspection delegation, consisting of eleven people. They departed on the 1st of this month and returned to Xiamen on the 14th. We are now pleased to share with you an article titled "A Perspective on Taiwan" written by Mr. Zhang Shuchun, the President of the Zhongnan Bank, who participated in the delegation. The article meticulously describes everything about Taiwan, and his observations are extremely insightful. Therefore, we are publishing it below.</p>
<p>This time, I only spent fourteen days in Taiwan. During this short trip, I made some observations on all aspects of this former territory of our country, which is now completely under Japanese administration. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to explain the content, products, and how the Japanese manage Taiwan, hoping to arouse readers' recognition and deep attention to it. I also ask readers to forgive me and not accuse me of promoting the Japanese; that would be fortunate indeed.</p>
<p>The motive for my visit to Taiwan this time actually started a year ago. At that time, someone invited me to go, but I couldn't spare the time, so I didn't go. Later, I saw the diary that this friend had written in Taiwan. The content was very detailed, but there were many complaints about Taiwan. This was probably because everyone's point of view is different, so the results of the observation will not be consistent. However, this aroused my interest in visiting Taiwan even more. Recently, there was another delegation to Taiwan in this city, so I resolutely joined it.</p>
<p>Before we departed, the Japanese side investigated the responsibilities and positions of each member of our group, and what we wanted to inspect, in order to arrange the itinerary. From these minor details, we can see how meticulous the Japanese are in everything. They are not like our countrymen, who are leisurely and generous, and don't care about anything. When our group arrived in Taiwan and disembarked, although we were treated better than ordinary passengers, we were still subjected to the rather unpleasant faces and quite strict inspections of the Japanese police.</p>
<p>Before we talk about the content of Taiwan, we must first know its historical evolution. The first Chinese people went to Taiwan as early as the Tang Dynasty. Later, it was occupied by Spain and the Netherlands successively. In the early Qing Dynasty, it completely became Chinese territory and a governor was appointed. It was not until the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, when our country was defeated, that it was ceded to Japan. In fact, if our country wants to recover it again, it is indeed not an easy task.</p>
<p>According to the latest statistics, the population of Taiwan is five million. There are about 50,000 overseas Chinese who have not entered Taiwanese citizenship, about 300,000 Japanese, 130,000 indigenous people who have been naturalized, and about 300,000 uncivilized indigenous people. The Japanese do not want to talk about the latter. In addition, almost all of them are people from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen in Fujian Province, who were forced to enter Taiwanese citizenship. The Japanese govern Taiwan completely by using a low-pressure coercive method, creating an ignorant and uneducated population for them to use and drive. What is even more painful is that when you talk to Taiwanese people about the relationship between Taiwan and Fujian, they are all at a loss. Many of them even don't know that Xiamen and Taiwan speak the same dialect. This is the success of Japanese slave education.</p>
<p>There are about seven or eight types of indigenous people in Taiwan. These indigenous people are of the same race as the indigenous people of the Philippines, or they may have come from there. Originally, they all lived along the coast, but later, because the Chinese population increased, they could not survive on the coast, so they retreated to the deep mountains. Now, the Japanese are completely using a method of educating dogs and horses to train them. For example, when they see Japanese people, they must bow and salute, teach them to dress and work, change their habits, and report births, deaths, marriages, and visits to relatives and friends. They are absolutely not allowed to have guns other than knives and arrows. Now, in order to facilitate management, the Japanese also want to bring them down from the deep mountains. The uncivilized indigenous people are completely blockaded, and they are advancing five miles into the mountains every year. If this continues, there will be a day when they are all wiped out.</p>
<p>In addition to the indigenous people, there are also Taiwanese people who have entered Chinese citizenship. The Japanese also use the same strategy to enslave them. Taiwan did not have a university at first, and Taiwanese people only had the opportunity to be educated up to the middle school level. Now, although there is a university, its content only focuses on agriculture, forestry, medical affairs, and the like. The occupations of Taiwanese people are limited to farmers and laborers, and a small number serve as police officers. It can be said that there are absolutely no civil servants, and there is no obligation to serve in the army. It is also rare to see senior staff in commercial institutions. Taiwanese people engaged in freelance professions are only lawyers and doctors.</p>
<p>The subtlety and ferocity of the Japanese police are well-known. The Japanese police in Taiwan are certainly no exception. Everything they do is interventionist. They will interfere if you don't do anything, and they will interfere if you don't work hard. They will also interfere if you spend too much money every day. Other things can be imagined. The security and increased production in Taiwan are said to be the credit of the Japanese police. Who would say that this is not appropriate?</p>
<p>The security in Taiwan is very good. It can be said that things dropped on the road are not picked up. The reason is that there are absolutely no guns and ammunition among the people, and you must have a passport to leave Taiwan. The inspection is also very strict. Thieves have naturally gradually disappeared. Originally, Chinese and Japanese people did not need passports to travel between the two countries, but Taiwan is an exception. It can be seen that the Japanese are locking down Taiwan, and they do not want our people to go there, nor do they want the Taiwanese people to come out. There are also very few people from Europe and the United States. I heard that there are only American and British consuls in Taipei, and a few Westerners who are missionaries, and only a few tea merchants living in Taipei.</p>
<p>The transportation in Taiwan. People who come to Taiwan for the first time feel that his road administration is not very good, and even not as good as Xiamen. However, if we put aside the surface and observe it from the aspects of its internal quality and effectiveness, we can know that he is entirely for the purpose of increasing production and facilitating transportation. He does not pay attention to form. There are almost light railways between cities and villages in Taiwan. People can use them freely. Even in places where there are no light railways, there are wide roads that reach everywhere to supply the driving of bullock carts and rubber carts, so agricultural products can also be sent from the fields to the station or the city at any time.</p>
<p>Under the direction and promotion of the Japanese, the quantity of agricultural products in Taiwan is alarming. According to the survey, Taiwan produces 21 million dan of rice per year, 25.6 million dan of sugar, and tea can be divided into three types: 5 million pounds of oolong tea, 8 million pounds of black tea, and 7.5 million dan of green tea, which together account for almost half of the world's production. Salt and tea have almost destroyed our country's markets. Bananas are 7 million tons, straw hats are 15 million, pineapples are 3 million dozen, wine production and sales are 7 million yuan, and alcohol is also 7 million yuan. In addition, the annual production of camphor reaches 7 million pounds, with a total revenue of 220 million yuan per year. The Japanese have established experimental fields for various agricultural products, and hired a number of experts to study and improve them. For the sugar item, the experiment was the most successful. For example, they have studied the types of sugar production, pests, pathogens, mating, etc. very carefully, and then notified the industry to carry out improvements. Now, they have successfully bred species from the Philippines, Java, etc. Because they are afraid that people from other countries will imitate them, they absolutely prohibit the sale of seeds.</p>
<p>The fishing industry in Taiwan is also very developed. They have built very large refrigerated warehouses and fishing markets. The scope of fishing is very wide, and it has almost reached the waters of the South Seas and the Philippines. The fishing market uses radio to report the weather conditions at sea for fishing boats far overseas every day, and broadcasts music and news for overseas fishermen to listen to. The fish caught are sorted and refrigerated, and then transported to China, Japan, the mainland, and various parts of the South Seas and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, the production of salt is also very large. In addition to supplying food for the people, it is also used as a raw material for crafts, so it is always felt that it is not enough and they have to buy salt from our country.</p>
<p>The Japanese recently built an aluminum plant in Kaohsiung with a capital of 10 million yuan. It is expected to have products by April next year. The required raw materials are shipped from an island in the Dutch East Indies. They hired a German engineer with a daily salary of 300 yuan, which cannot be said to be small. However, the Japanese are very good at using foreigners. They can not only let him show his strengths, but also prevent the power from falling into the hands of others.</p>
<p>Currently, there are five things that are monopolized by the government in Taiwan, namely tobacco, alcohol, camphor, salt, and opium. The opium all comes from Persia and is called red soil. The morphine content is very low. After being made into opium paste and left for a year, it is sold again. The annual revenue from these five monopolies is about 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>There are three largest businesses in Taiwan: (1) The Tainan Prefecture Tainan Great Irrigation Association is to build dams in the low-lying areas according to the mountain shapes, store the water, and use it to irrigate the fields, and then wash away the saline soil in the fields near the sea for planting. It is said that the cost of building dams, etc. is 54 million yuan, which can irrigate 450,000 jia (about 25 mu per jia). The annual water fee is about 1.5 million yuan. The increased production is 40 million yuan in two years. (2) The Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant in Hsinchu Prefecture uses only hydropower and can supply the entire Taiwan. It has 100,000 kilowatts of power. (3) It is the fishing industry mentioned in the previous section. There are many aquatic product experimental fields that specialize in research. The research results are used to improve fishermen. In addition, there is a product display hall in every place, which also has a great effect on the marketing of commerce.</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese have occupied Taiwan for a total of forty-three years, and they have spent great effort in management, but his purpose is only to use the production obtained from the blood and sweat of the five million Taiwanese people to enrich his strength and satisfy his ambition to surpass the world. Therefore, when we talk about Taiwan, everyone should strive to increase production and strive for self-improvement, and learn his methods of increasing production. In particular, everything in Fujian Province, such as the climate, is the same as Taiwan. This is the real intention of Fujian to send people to Taiwan to inspect many times.</p>

<h3>International Football Preliminary Round Ends: China and Jewish Teams Gain Re-examination Rights. China Barely Defeats Russia with a Score of Two to Zero. China, England, Portugal, and the Jewish Team Compete for the Finals</h3>
<p>After the international football preliminary round began the day before yesterday, except for England, who entered the re-examination week without any effort, Portugal first eliminated Germany with a score of seven to zero. Yesterday, China defeated Russia with a score of two to zero, and the Jewish team, due to its well-organized lineup, eliminated France with a score of six to four. China and the Jewish team both obtained the right to be re-examined on the same day. Currently, the re-examination week has become a competition between China, England, Portugal, and the Jewish team. However, the re-examination must wait until the end of January next year before it can be held. Which country China will compete with for the finals is still a mystery. The war report yesterday is recorded below,</p>
<p>China Beats Russia</p>
<p>China and Russia met at Shenyuan yesterday. There were about 800 spectators, which was the first lively event since the beginning of this year's football season. As a result of the competition, China scored two goals in the first half, continuously shot by Sun Jinshun, (the first one was a twelve-yard penalty), taking the lead with a score of two to zero. In the second half, the Russian offensive was extremely strong. Because Zhang Rongcai was agile and rescued many dangerous balls, the Russian side finally had no place to use martial arts. China also counterattacked many times, but failed to achieve success, and finally eliminated Russia with a score of two to zero to obtain the right to be re-examined. However, the battle situation was scattered and lacked stimulation. After the game, there was a commotion among the audience, which almost led to violence. After the Shenyuan staff worked hard to resolve it, they realized that it was all a misunderstanding. It turned out that a Russian spectator asked the referee Chen Jixiang a question. A passionate person thought it was a question, and went forward to block it, which led to the commotion.</p>

<p>Jewish Team Beats France</p>
<p>The match between the Jewish team and France was held at the racetrack yesterday. The Jewish team was organized by the Class A players of Lakers and Xishang, and its strength was naturally strong. Although France mainly consisted of French businessmen, most of them were Class B figures. The strength was very different, and the outcome was decided early. However, the French team used its entire army and worked hard in the battle yesterday, so the progress was very average. In the upper and lower halves, France was behind by three to two, resulting in a total result of failure by six to four. However, the French team created three equal situations in the entire game, which was not easy. In the end, they were eliminated due to insufficient strength, and the Jewish team won the right to be re-examined.</p>
<h3>Results of Each Field in the Western Union Football Yesterday</h3>
<p>In yesterday's Class C match at Hongkou Park, both Guanglu and Yousheng only appeared with nine players.

<p>The 20,000-meter long-distance race organized by the Hongkou Cross-Country Team started at 8:30 yesterday morning in Hongkou Park. A total of one hundred and twenty-three people signed up, but due to the rain the night before, only sixty-five people actually registered. Young players Zhang Liang and Wang Rulin, etc., also failed to arrive in time due to matters. As a result, the championship was won by Wang Zhenglin with a time of one hour, ten minutes, thirty-seven and three-fifths of a second. Niu Hongquan was in the lead from beginning to end. In the last two thousand meters, his toes were bleeding, which led to him finishing fourth, which was a pity. Ling Xuewen won second place with one hour, eleven minutes, and twenty-eight and two seconds. The third place was Wu Wenlin.</p>

However, afterwards, in the game report filled in by the Guanghua coach, Gu Dingxiang was filled in as the right wing. According to Gu Dingxiang, he was actually training in Suzhou and did not participate in the game. Jinan then protested against someone impersonating him and provided solid evidence that Dingxiang had not returned from Suzhou. After several meetings of the Standing Committee, Guanghua also stated that it was a mistake in filling in at the time. Yesterday, the Standing Committee made a final decision at the YMCA to cancel the championship, and the prizes that had been issued were recovered from Guanghua by the General Assembly for safekeeping.</p>

<h3>Beijing Boy Scout Group Goes to Trouble Spot: To Xi'an to Greet Chairman Chiang's Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th) Dozens of people, including Jing Zhongying, Dongfang Zhongnan, and other middle school heavyweights such as Ye Youlin, were filled with righteous indignation and hatred after Zhang Xueliang's rebellion and kidnapping of Chairman Chiang, which shook the foundation of the country. They specially formed a trouble spot group to go to Xi'an to respectfully welcome Chairman Chiang's return to Beijing, willing to go through fire and water. On the 19th, the members of the group submitted a request to the Beijing Boy Scout Council, requesting approval. The Council believes that the members of the group support the leader, love the country, and are sincere in their automatic dedication, which cannot be suppressed. However, it is important to consider whether the members have obtained the consent of their families and school principals in advance, as well as their physical condition, age, and any other impediments. It is heard that the Council will hold an emergency meeting to deal with this matter. It is also said that many boy scouts in Beijing are influenced to respond.</p>
<p>Shandong Provincial Education Circle: The Shandong Provincial Education Circle and Colleagues Send Telegram to Zhang Yang: Respectfully to Mr. Zhang Hanqing and Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an: The Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, and Chairman Chiang was kidnapped, shocking the whole country and deeply saddened and indignant. When the pacification of the war was victorious and there was hope for revival, such perverse actions would place the country and nation in a state of irreparable disaster. The world is watching with bated breath. How can the public be human? It is not too late to rein in the precipice. We earnestly hope that you will quickly escort the commander back to Beijing and leave the merits and demerits to public opinion. If you continue to act like a tiger relying on its corner, you will inevitably be like a ram butting against a fence, and it will be too late to regret it. Turning back is the highest hope. Shandong Provincial Education Circle and all students kowtow.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai to Talk About the Shaanxi Incident: Easy to Resolve: If Military Force is Used, It Will Not Take More Than Two or Three Weeks: Zhang Will Never Dare to Harm Chairman Chiang's Hair</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, and legislators Chuan Bingchang and Wu Jingxiong, took the night train together the night before last and left Beijing for Shanghai. They arrived at Zhenru Station at 6:50 yesterday morning and returned to their private residences to rest. President Sun then received news reporters at his private residence on Columbia Road at about 10:30 in the morning and made important remarks about the Xi'an Incident as follows:</p>
<p>Xi'an Incident: Easy to Resolve</p>
<p>According to President Sun, as of the evening of the 19th, Chairman Chiang was still not out of danger. If Zhang Xueliang uses this as a delaying tactic, he will only see his efforts fail. The punitive expeditionary forces are still advancing according to the predetermined plan. Chairman Chiang may be out of danger in a few days, otherwise, it will be resolved by military force, and the rebel army can be completely resolved in no more than two or three weeks. As for the safety of Chairman Chiang, there is absolutely no problem. Zhang Xueliang's kidnapping of Chairman Chiang was intended to "hold the emperor hostage to command the princes," and he would never dare to harm Chairman Chiang's hair.</p>
<p>Absolutely No Talk of Political Issues</p>
<p>The central government will absolutely not discuss any political issues with the rebels at present. Mr. Song Ziwen's flight to Shaanxi was purely in a personal capacity to visit Chairman Chiang and to meet with Zhang Xueliang. I did receive a telegram from Zhang Xueliang, welcoming me to visit Shaanxi. Other important officials of the central government have also received the same telegram. In Zhang Xueliang's dream, he hopes that all the important officials of the central government will be his prisoners. This is only enough to expose Zhang Xueliang's immaturity and stupidity. All provincial and municipal authorities absolutely support the central government and have requested the suppression of the rebels. The people of the whole country are also like this.</p>
<p>Armed Rebellion: Bandit Nature Manifested</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's rebellion this time is said to have been backed by the Soviet Union, but this is not true. As for any connection with the Chinese Communists, there is no news yet. Zhang Xueliang's use of anti-Japanese resistance as a slogan is even more ridiculous. Zhang Xueliang had already lost the land of the four eastern provinces, and now, at a time when the front-line anti-Japanese war is tense, he kidnapped the commander and detained the front-line commanders, armed himself and rebelled, and disturbed the rear, and said that he was resisting Japan. Who would believe him? Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng's rebellion is only enough to show their "bandit nature." Before the 400 million compatriots in China are exterminated, Zhang Xueliang and others are not worthy of talking about resisting Japan.</p>
<p>Suiyuan Front: Not Affected</p>
<p>There is no major war on the Suiyuan front at present. The bandit and puppet troops have surrendered one after another. As for the anti-bandit military affairs in Suiyuan, they are not affected by the Xi'an Incident and are still proceeding according to the original plan. I came to Shanghai this time for a short stay and plan to take the night train back to Beijing tonight (the 21st).</p>
<h3>A Certain Former Reporter of the North China Daily News in Shanghai, Who Once Served as a Reporter in Xi'an, Talks Freely About the Causes and Consequences of the Shaanxi Incident: The Northeast Army is Tyrannical, Zhang Xueliang is Incompetent: Soon Chairman Chiang Will Be Sent Out of Danger</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a certain reporter who was recently in Xi'an and is now residing in Shanghai claimed yesterday that anyone who has resided in Xi'an in the past year is not surprised by the recent Xi'an Incident. The discussions in teahouses and taverns in Xi'an about the Northeast Army establishing an independent governing area in Shaanxi Province, like the three eastern provinces before the September 18th Incident, were so familiar that it could be said that they lacked cleverness. The discipline of the Northeast Army was gone, and they became willful. They arbitrarily abused the residents. Therefore, since entering Shaanxi, the people of Shaanxi have been frowning. The Northeast Army regarded Shaanxi Province as a conquered land. Their entry into Shaanxi was nominally to suppress the Communists, but the residents of Xi'an would cover their mouths and laugh when they heard the words "suppress the bandits." These people not only never fought the Communists, but Zhang Xueliang and the Communists had a tacit understanding. This matter has become an open secret. As for the phrase "loyal to the central government," it has never been heard in the Northeast Army. In May of this year, when the two Guangdong uprisings occurred, these people often revealed emotions of support and joy in their conversations. When the reporter occasionally expressed opinions contrary to these people, these people reluctantly perfunctorily said that it was unfortunate that a unified China was still engaging in such infighting. The reporter still remembers that one evening, when attending a banquet in the auditorium of the China Travel Service New Hotel, there were several senior military officers of the Northeast Army at the long table next door, holding a banquet to celebrate the birthday of one of them. Everyone drank heavily and became drunk. Then, they gave speeches in turn, praising their leader "Young Marshal" (who was not present), the unity and achievements of the Northeast Army, and the courage and virtue of each person. However, no one mentioned the central government or the commander-in-chief. Judging from the words of these people, there was really no commander-in-chief in their minds. Several newspapers have recently published reports about the great progress of Xi'an to show that Zhang Xueliang has far-reaching plans. This is indeed unconscious. The people of Xi'an have never expressed a word of gratitude to Zhang. The progress of Xi'an in recent years has been purely the work of the central government and implemented under the guidance of Provincial Chairman Shao Lizi, which has nothing to do with Zhang Xueliang. The money Zhang Xueliang spent in Xi'an was to expand the old palace where the Empress Dowager Cixi stayed when she fled to Shaanxi during the Boxer Rebellion. Zhang now uses it as his headquarters, with hundreds of staff stationed inside. Little Zhang lost land and humiliated the country in the Northeast, but he is still so noticed by the people of the country. The only reason is probably because the Japanese are not clear-headed and value Zhang and make him a mortal enemy. Zhang has no ability to make the Japanese uneasy, but they value him so much, which makes people wonder why. However, since the Japanese plan to get rid of him, the Chinese will naturally respect him on the contrary. Therefore, although Zhang has not made any contributions to the country, he can still be a useless hero of the whole country. If the Japanese had ignored Zhang long ago, from the Japanese point of view, Zhang would not be worth a look. Then Zhang Xueliang would definitely be living in seclusion in Dalian or other Japanese concessions as an ordinary citizen today. Judging from Zhang's character, we have to admit that Zhang is not the mastermind of this incident. He was probably forced to do this by several of his subordinates, who are more crude and barbaric than Zhang and from bandit backgrounds. However, this view remains to be proven by future events.</p>
<p>What is the actual strength of the Northeast Army in Shaanxi Province today? The reports vary. Some say that there are as many as 200,000 people, and some say that there are as few as 30,000 people. As far as the reporter knows, the total number is more than 100,000 people, scattered in various counties in northern Shaanxi. In addition, Yang Hucheng has about 30,000 to 50,000 people. In terms of combat effectiveness, Zhang Yang's army is really vulnerable. These people have never experienced a proper battle, or even fought a battle with bandits. The 19th Route Army is one of the elite troops in China, but when it rebelled in Fujian a few years ago, the central government's planes made it lose its troops and unable to form an army in less than two weeks. Now, with the Shanxi rebel army being suppressed by the army, it will not be difficult to pacify it in a week. Moreover, the leaders of the rebel army are all cowards, so it is expected that these people will safely send Chairman Chiang out when they are completely surrounded and have no way to escape, in order to save their own skin and bones.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Flies to Shanghai to Preside Over Financial Affairs: Wu Qiding and Others Come Together</h3>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident occurred, Minister Kong entrusted Song Ziwen to take care of Shanghai's financial affairs because the central government's affairs were complicated. Now that Song has flown to Shaanxi to visit Chairman Chiang, he ordered Xu Kan to fly to Shanghai by Eurasia plane at 5 pm yesterday to preside over the affairs on his behalf. Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, Song Zian, Deputy Director of the Songjiang Transportation Department, and Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau, went to Beijing to report to Kong on the tax revenue situation. Now that the matter has been completed, they arrived in Shanghai with Xu on the same plane and returned to their posts.</p>
<h3>Keane Inspects Suiyuan: Speaks Upon Arrival in Shanghai: Describes the Talks of the Surrendered Generals</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, New York Tribune reporter Keane recently went to Guihua and met with Chairman Fu and other generals. He returned to Shanghai on Friday (the 18th). The next day, he told the Continental News reporter that he left Shanghai on December 2nd and stayed in Guihua for 12 days. He then went to Bailing Temple and was well received by the officers and soldiers under Chairman Bo. However, they said that all foreigners in the Sui Province war zone were ordered by the authorities to withdraw a month ago. Now that he is visiting, he must take his own risks. On December 11, he met with Ji Zihe, the commander of the cavalry brigade of Wang Ying's surrendered troops. According to him, the enemy army was commanded by a certain foreigner, whose Chinese name was the enemy army's military expenditure, which was "Xiaoping," and was also appointed by a certain party. Military aircraft, truck drivers, food, bullets, and other items were all supplied by a certain party, as well as commanding personnel. Jin Xianzhang, the brigade commander, surrendered at Daming Temple. At that time, he handed over ten field artillery pieces, machine guns, a large number of rifles, and 150,000 rounds of ammunition. A total of 1,000 people surrendered. Before the surrender, they executed 40 military officers from a certain party in the brigade on December 9, including radio operators and instructors. According to the government bulletin published in Guihua the day before the incident, which also mentioned this, it is indeed true. He asked whether any military officers from a certain party were killed in action in Bailing Temple and other places. Ji replied that this statement was not true. The military officers from a certain party often stayed in the rear during the attack. As soon as they saw that the battle was lost, they would escape in the prepared vehicles. A certain party provided the soldiers with poisonous gas bombs and smoke bombs, but the soldiers were afraid of harming civilians and were unwilling to use poisonous gas bombs in combat. When Keane arrived in Bailing Temple, the Chinese army commander treated him well. The wine and food at the banquet were all produced in a certain country. It is said that a long time before the war, a certain party transported a large amount of food from Tianjin to Bailing Temple via Guihua for storage. Chairman Chuan did not prohibit it. Now that the war has been successful, this military food is entirely used by the Chinese army and is enough for one year.</p>

<h3>This City's Military Training Students and Trained Citizens Organize National Salvation and Peril-Facing Corps</h3>
<p>This city's military training students and trained citizens are extremely indignant at Generalissimo Chiang's ordeal in Xi'an. Yesterday, they issued a telegram calling on military training students and trained citizens across the country to unanimously volunteer to quell the rebellion. They also gathered over a thousand people and specially organized a National Salvation and Peril-Facing Corps to welcome Generalissimo Chiang back to the capital. They are awaiting permission from military and political leaders before departing for Xi'an. The declaration of the National Salvation and Peril-Facing Corps is as follows, as learned from investigation:</p>
<p>To the soldiers fighting bravely in the front lines, braving the cold and blood, and to the whole nation, sending greetings of fervent support for the national resistance war, suddenly, Zhang Xueliang kidnapped our supreme revolutionary leader, Generalissimo Chiang, and rebelled in Xi'an. This news filled the officers and soldiers on the front lines with boundless grief and indignation and caused people across the country, young and old, men and women, especially the youth, to shed many generous and impassioned tears.</p>
<p>We are part of the nation and have the responsibility that "everyone is responsible for the fate of their country." We have long dedicated our heads and blood to the nation, to Generalissimo Chiang, the leader responsible for national revival and unification. At this time when treacherous rebels endanger the country and disaster looms, we must naturally unite with our many conscientious and spirited young soldiers to form an iron-blooded corps to face the national crisis together. The members of this iron-blooded corps are composed of young laborers from schools, factories, and rural areas, bearing the responsibility of national production and entrusted with the future destiny of the country.</p>
<p>For the sake of our country and nation, to resolutely support the leader and complete the great task of national revival, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our studies and work, and even more so, we will not hesitate to sacrifice our personal lives. We vow to go through fire and water with the determination that our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but our leader must be welcomed back to the capital to preside over the great plan of national salvation and survival.</p>
<p>To use our sacrifice to save the fate of the country and rescue the leader from his predicament, this is our most sacred and glorious undertaking.</p>
<p>What a frivolous and shameless person Zhang Xueliang is! His father was killed by the enemy, yet he did not think of avenging his father. In one night, he forfeited thousands of miles of land in the three northeastern provinces and three million people with sweet songs and drunken dances. He, who embodies both national and paternal hatred, should have committed suicide long ago to apologize to the nation if he had any conscience and blood. Instead, he colluded with bandits, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, and disrupted the completed national unification. How can he face the leader's profound kindness and his father's resentment? How can he face the nation? Kidnapping our leader is tantamount to forfeiting the life of our nation because the leader is the one entrusted with our nation's life. We know that among our enemies, who fears us the most? It is our Generalissimo Chiang. His noble and great personality, his history of sacrifice and struggle, and his tenacious and indomitable spirit have formed China's only leader, recognized not only by the people of the whole country but also internationally. Since the "September 18th Incident," how difficult and arduous has the national situation been, and how treacherous has the international environment been! It is thanks to our leader that we have forged a path to national revival from hardship and adversity. Now, we are about to advance along this path, but Zhang Xueliang suddenly rebelled on this path, plunging our country back into the path of death. This traitorous rebel is truly unprecedented in five thousand years of history.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's collusion with the Red bandits to overthrow the government is a complete betrayal of the nation. To save China now, we must first ensure that the Chinese nation achieves independence and liberation. This is something everyone knows. The White enemy certainly wants to destroy our nation, but doesn't the Red enemy also want to destroy our nation? The tragedy of Spain is vividly displayed before our eyes. How could Zhang Xueliang not know this? But he sacrificed the nation for his personal desires and the resurgence of his warlord ambitions. He sacrificed 400 million compatriots across the country for his sacrifice. He sacrificed the Chinese nation with 5,000 years of history for his sacrifice. Such a traitor is a sinner of the nation and a public enemy of the whole nation.</p>
<p>The unified situation in China today has been achieved through the sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs and the expenditure of immense resources and wealth. Now, we are concentrating the nation's strength under the government's established national policy to undertake the fundamental task of saving the country and ensuring its survival. The Battle of Suiyuan can be regarded as the initial step of the national policy. Since the start of the resistance war, we have achieved successive victories. Bailingmiao has been recovered, and Damiaozi has also been recovered. The leader told us that overcoming Bailingmiao is the starting point for national revival. Yet Zhang Xueliang rebelled in the midst of this national revival, giving the enemy a great opportunity to counterattack. Zhang Xueliang is not only a traitor to the Red enemy but also a traitor to the White enemy. Now that the government has issued a clear order to suppress him, we believe that the government and the people of the whole country have more than enough strength to eliminate Zhang Xueliang. And now, we are also prepared to face the national crisis for the country. Wherever our leader is, whether it is a volcano or hell, we have prepared our heads and blood to welcome our leader back to the capital to lead us in the work of suppressing bandits and resisting the enemy, and to continue the cause of the Chinese nation's revival. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Yan Duhe delivered a political speech, stating that the autumn meeting was originally intended as a social gathering, but recently a major change had occurred, and what joy could the people of the country have? Today's meeting is also a gathering of unhappiness, but since preparations have been completed, it must be held as scheduled. We firmly believe that the power of unity is enough to overcome difficulties. Holding it at Zhengyi Society makes us firmly believe that adhering to "righteousness" is enough to deal with crises and achieve our goals. He also stated the reason for postponing the meeting. Then, Mao Yun, a representative from the city party headquarters, gave instructions, saying that in addition to the various purposes stipulated in the association's constitution, it also bears a major mission. Gentlemen of your association are social mentors and authorities on public opinion. A word is enough to build a country, and a word is enough to destroy a country. Especially in Shanghai, where international attention is focused, and where the tone is set, it is enough to lead the whole country. I hope to lead the national people to unanimously trust the national policy determined by the government, and unanimously support it, so that the national crisis can be resolved and the nation can be revived. Next, Chen Kecheng, a representative from the municipal government, gave instructions, saying that he usually met with the gentlemen and exchanged opinions, and that he had no special opinions to contribute at this time. However, judging from the recent situation, the news industry has gradually been valued by all parties, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Next, Chairman Zhao Junhao reported on the association's affairs, briefly describing the main work and general situation of the association in the past six months.</p>
<p>Discussion of Motions</p>
<p>When it came to the discussion of the motions, the atmosphere at the meeting was tense, and the members discussed them enthusiastically, and finally resolved as follows: (1) The membership badges of this association are still lacking for new members. The old badges were used up before and could not be issued. I request the general meeting to quickly manufacture and distribute them to identify members and comply with the constitution. Resolution passed; (2) Please have this association initiate a national public campaign to save money on New Year's cards to be used as donations to Suiyuan. Because there is not enough time to promote it, this motion is not established; (3) Reporters from various newspapers in this city who have registered with party and government agencies should find ways to make all of them join this association to increase the strength of this association (proposed by Hu Zhuoren and Zhu Chaoran). Resolution passed, to be discussed and drafted by the Executive Supervisory Committee; (4) All resolutions passed by this association's previous general meetings that have not been implemented should be strictly given a deadline for implementation. Resolution: All resolutions passed by previous general meetings that have not been implemented shall be thoroughly sorted out by the Executive Committee and implemented within a deadline of one month. Whether or not they can be implemented, the Executive Committee shall report to all members in writing.</p>
<p>Drawing Gifts</p>
<p>At this point, all members took their seats for dinner, and Sun Daosheng reported on the method of drawing gifts, and said that this association's general meeting should express its gratitude to the following groups and individuals: (1) Zhengyi Society for free use of the meeting place; (2) The China National Goods Production and Sales Association and the Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, which separately solicited valuable national goods gifts from their affiliated factories; (3) Mr. Xu Jianruo of Zhengyi Society and this year's solicitor Ma Chonggan, Ma Zhishan, Guo Butao, Hang Shijun, Zhu Mingxin, and other gentlemen for their enthusiastic support. A total of more than 1,500 pieces of national goods gifts and more than 500 pieces of celebrity books were collected. As a result of the drawing, Mr. Yuan Yeyu of the Minbao won a Hua Tong Electric Factory 220-pound reflective electric furnace No. 1 gift, Mr. Ji Cheng Gengnong of Xinsheng won a Da Ji Cheng sable-lined mandarin jacket No. 12 gift, Mr. Dai Zhichao of Shenbao won a Mei Ya Xue Mei satin cheongsam material No. 2 gift, and the gifts won by the remaining members were also very wonderful.</p>
<p>Entertainment and More</p>
<p>During the dinner, entertainment began. First, Zhu Baoxia, Zhu Zixia, Yu Lianxian, Song Xiaofang, and Xiao Yueming performed the famous Ping Opera play "Du Shiniang," which was very emotional. Then, Zhu Guoliang and Zhang Fengyun sang improved Suzhou Opera, which was also very interesting. It ended at 10 p.m. with joy.</p>

<h3>盜匪駕車行刦　來去均以汽車刦掠一小時　乾豐皮貨店損失一萬餘金</h3>
<p>Last night at around 7 p.m., five robbers suddenly arrived at Qianfeng Fur Shop, No. 140 Da Ping Nongkou, Daimailu, Nanshi. Three were wearing blue short clothes, and two were wearing long gowns. They had previously rented a Southern tour car, with the city license plate No. 1339 and the rental license plate No. 8934. Upon arrival, one robber stood guard, while four robbers broke in, speaking in local and foreign accents. Each robber showed their guns and threatened the people inside. They looted the shop for an hour, taking away 400 yuan in paper money, over 100 yuan in fractional currency, and over 2,000 yellow wolf pelts, each valued at around 15 yuan, for a total loss of over 10,000 yuan. After getting their loot, the robbers escaped by car without a trace. The victim reported the incident to the 16th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>冒薟支票騙欵　鄭文奎判三年　并賠償一千四百餘金</h3>
<p>Zheng Wenkui, a clerk at the Hongkou branch of Guohua Bank located at No. 8, Nanjing Road, colluded with a fugitive around 1:00 PM on the 10th of this month. They presented a check with a forged signature of manager Gu Bangduo to the deposit department of the main branch at No. 156, Beijing Road, and withdrew 5,000 yuan in legal tender. After the incident was reported, Zhang Jinshan, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station, secretly went to Zheng’s residence at No. 3 workshop of Lida Yarn Factory, arrested him, and seized 3,521 yuan of the original stolen legal tender. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the defendant's accomplice was still at large, and requested a severe punishment according to the law. The Guohua Main Branch also hired a lawyer to appear in court and filed a civil suit, demanding repayment of the 1,470 yuan that was missing. The judge questioned the defendant, whose testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao sentenced Zheng Wenkui to three years in prison and ordered him to repay the plaintiff 1,479 yuan in legal tender. Upon hearing the sentence, Zheng lowered his head and said nothing, and was taken away by the police to experience the taste of an iron window.</p>
<h3>同昌福綢緞荘　昨日大火　損失五萬元</h3>
<p>Tongchangfu Silk and Satin Cotton Cloth Shop, located at No. 618 to 622 Daimailu, Nanshi, is a four-bay, three-story building and a newly built house. The shop has been open on Daimailu for more than 20 years, so it has a good reputation in the Shanghai South area. It was founded by Mr. Yu, a wealthy gentleman in Shanghai, and hired Mr. Feng Boan to manage the shop. The business was usually very prosperous. Yesterday afternoon at 2:20 PM, business was in full swing when an electrical fire suddenly broke out in the wool textile and velvet piece goods room on the third floor. Black smoke filled the air and poured out of the windows. Neighbors spotted the fire and quickly reported it to the police on duty, who called the fire department from each district to drive to the scene to put out the fire. Meanwhile, the shop first used its own fire extinguishers to fight the fire, but the fire was too intense. It was not extinguished until around 4:00 PM.

<h3>China Anti-Tuberculosis Association: Speech by the Secretary-General - Correcting Deviant Public Psychology</h3>
<p>The Secretary-General of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Tong Xingmen, gave a radio speech on anti-tuberculosis on the 20th at the Dunben Radio Station on Minguo Road. The idea was novel, and the wording was alert. His speech is briefly recorded below: Mr. Tong said that infectious diseases in our country have spread excessively, accounting for nearly half of the total mortality rate. According to the survey by the National Health Administration of the East, six million people die each year due to illness, and three million people die unjustly from infectious diseases. Moreover, those who die from tuberculosis account for another 1.6 million people. Thus, the severity of tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious diseases. Moreover, most of those who die from this disease are young and promising youth, which is truly a great loss to the nation. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out practical prevention and propaganda. Based on my personal observations, people in our country do not know how to prevent and treat all diseases, but because their psychology in dealing with diseases is not according to common practice, and many fallacies occur, it is often very easy to treat or minor illnesses, which evolve into extremely difficult to treat or incurable situations. The various fallacious treatment psychologies of the people are analyzed below: (1) Seeking temporary ease and security. Symptoms such as colds, coughs, dizziness, and fever are very mild when they are discovered. However, if they are prolonged for a long time, they can turn into various difficult-to-treat and serious symptoms. Unfortunately, ordinary people do not pay attention to this. When they get a minor illness, they are unwilling to seek treatment quickly, hoping that it will subside naturally, or they are afraid of trouble and saving money, and let it evolve naturally. When it gets deeper and deeper and the body is weak, or the pain is unbearable, then the family members become flustered and adopt the second unscientific treatment method below: (2) Acting only when a crisis is imminent. After the illness worsens, they think of seeking divination, buying hexagrams, eating elixirs, herbal remedies, inviting monks and Taoists, and doing superstitious acts such as expelling ghosts and thanking gods. This not only does not benefit the patient, but may even increase the severity of the patient's condition. (3) Not fearing death until seeing the coffin. When the patient becomes delirious, the family realizes that the various small methods are ineffective and the ghostly prayers are not applicable. Then they go to invite traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and Western medicine practitioners. Their opinions differ, and they use both medicines and stones, sending a living soul to the West. The above discussion is, of course, a common phenomenon in rural areas or small city groups. However, even in large cities with scientific enlightenment and superior culture, these strange things can be seen everywhere. Even in families that claim to be intellectuals, due to excessive superstition in divine power, they will also copy this semi-civilized method of treating diseases. Because of this improper and unscientific method of treating diseases, the number of Chinese people who die from infectious diseases has increased significantly. Moreover, tuberculosis is a disease that comes on very slowly, has extremely complex causes, is extremely easy to spread, and is extremely difficult to treat. Therefore, those who die from this disease naturally occupy the top spot. Now, let's talk about the issue of tuberculosis prevention. In addition to active official propaganda and popularizing hygiene, I would like to tell the audience about the necessary procedures for recuperation and treatment. At the same time, it is necessary to clarify that these treatment principles can also be applied to the treatment of all other infectious diseases. It can also be said that these treatment principles are a new way to correct the general fallacious psychology of treating diseases. So, what exactly are these principles? (1) Isolation. When signs of tuberculosis are discovered, it must be immediately isolated from healthy people (not sleeping in the same room, not eating the same food). (2) Early treatment. Go to or invite an experienced lung disease specialist for diagnosis. (3) X-ray examination. A detailed examination of the lung condition or taking photographs using X-rays. (4) Application of artificial pneumothorax. If the lungs have been found to be rotten, then artificial pneumothorax must be applied. (5) Rest. Tuberculosis patients must never overwork, exercise, or worry. (6) Eat more tonics. Eat tonics such as milk, eggs, and meat. (7) Often sit, lie down, and rest in sunlight and fresh air. (8) Absolutely obey the doctor's instructions. In short, disease is a kind of pain that everyone cannot avoid in life. As long as you read more health knowledge publications when you are healthy and develop habits that are suitable for hygiene, and you can quickly seek medical diagnosis when you get sick and treat it seriously according to the doctor's instructions, then even a weak constitution can develop a healthy national body. At the same time, the title of "sick man of East Asia" can be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<h3>### Shandong Bandit Comes to Shanghai to Open a School and Teach - Victim Secretly Informs Police Station - Case Transferred for Investigation and Interrogation</h3>

Unexpectedly, yesterday, a victim secretly reported to the Liyuan Road Police Station, accusing him of the above situation, claiming that Mao was a famous Shandong bandit, and that if he was not believed, his legs and neck could be examined for gunshot scars. Because he had difficulty walking, his neighbors called him "Mr. Iron Crutch Li," and he had cut his hair and changed his appearance. They asked the police station to arrest him and bring him to justice. According to the situation, the police station sent police to transfer him for investigation and seized two sets of mahjong tiles, playing cards, and dozens of name cards of "Praying to the Old Man," and transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>### Vegetable Prices Rise - Difficult Life for the Common People</h3>
<p>In recent days, the prices of all goods in the city have been expensive, and ordinary citizens have been particularly affected by edible vegetables. According to a survey yesterday, compared with previous years, it is briefly recorded as follows: Green vegetables (commonly known as cabbage) 140 to 200 copper coins per catty, Taihu radish 120 to 160 copper coins per catty, pickled Xue Li Hong 400 to 480 copper coins per catty, pickled cabbage 320 to 400 copper coins per catty, yellow sprouts 120 to 160 copper coins per catty, green bean sprouts are slightly the same as yellow bean sprouts, bean sprouts 160 to 200 copper coins per catty, cabbage 200 to 240 copper coins per catty, tower vegetables 240 to 220 copper coins per catty, golden flower vegetables (commonly known as grass heads) 400 to 480 copper coins per catty. Last year, cabbage was about 50 to 60 copper coins per catty, Taihu radish was about 40 to 50 copper coins per catty, pickled Xue Li Hong was about 150 to 160 copper coins per catty, pickled cabbage was about 120 to 130 copper coins per catty, yellow bean sprouts/bean sprouts/bean sprouts were about 100 copper coins per catty, cabbage was about 70 to 80 copper coins per catty, tower vegetables were about 140 to 150 copper coins per catty, and grass heads were about 200 copper coins per catty.

<h3>### Public Celebration of Wang Yiting's Birthday in Various Circles of the City</h3>
<p>Today at noon, Wu Xing Wang Yiting, a senior figure in the art world with lofty prestige and dedicated to social charity, will be celebrated. The 22nd of this month is Mr. Wang's 70th birthday. More than 100 leaders from all walks of life in the city, including Cai Yuanpei, Wu Tiecheng, Li Yuying, Qian Yongming, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Qinglan, Zhang Qun, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Hu, Liu Haisu, Chu Fucheng, Li Dachao, He Bingsong, and Yan Ganyuan, launched a celebration at Ziyuan, Qiaojia Road, Nanshi, with wine and food. Liu Haisu also personally wrote a birthday speech, which is excerpted as follows: "When the times are dark and we are blocked, there must be someone who enters it. In a place where roots and knots are intertwined, he maintains and operates, hoping to save the world from calamity in invisible ways. As the times change, his achievements are established, although they are not enough to be seen in the present. However, his words and deeds can unite the masses and reach up and down without obstacles. His name and life are truly different from ordinary people. For example, Mr. Wang Yiting of Wu Xing, who learned the three talents in his early years and devoted himself to painting, then devoted himself to practical industries. He knows everything about social charity and does everything he can. In recent years, he has felt the decline of the world and devoutly studied Buddhism, and his heart of benevolence and love for the people has not declined in his old age. He has lived in Shanghai for forty years, and women and children all admire him. Only the benevolent can live long. The 22nd of this year is Mr. Wang's 70th birthday. Colleagues, etc., either join in the joy of silk robes or form a bond of orchids. Based on the sincerity of respecting the old and admiring righteousness, we launch an event to celebrate his old age. We love to celebrate Mr. Wang's endless life in advance at his nursing home on the 21st. In the future, God will bless the lucky star, and his spirit will be strong. From old age to centenarian, this is what colleagues, etc., are looking forward to and holding a sure win."</p>

<h3>Woman Gives Birth to Daughter After Divorce - Accuses Ex-Husband of Abandonment - Child's Appearance Can Be Examined - Defendant Not Present, Case Continued for Hearing</h3>
<p>Wu Xuezhen, a young woman from the first household of the sixth Jia of the fifth Bao, Yinghu Township, Minhang District, Shanghai County, is 18 years old. At the age of 15, she married Hua Shaoxiang (age 20) from the fourth household of the second Jia of the same township. She had a daughter, who died early. Wu Xuezhen became pregnant again this year. Due to some reason, she was divorced by her husband. Since March of this year, she was sent back to her mother's home after being divorced by the township chief Chen Guojun and the Bao chief Jiang Xueqiao. On October 20, Xuezhen gave birth to a daughter named Shaozi at the Women and Children's Hospital. Because the biological father had abandoned his wife and daughter, she first sent a lawyer's letter to support her, but it was ignored. She accused him of abandonment under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. The defendant claimed that when he lived with Xuezhen, he had not been in the same room for a long time due to illness and did not recognize Shaozi as his own. Therefore, Xuezhen hired lawyer Zhang Shewo to sue the local court, requesting confirmation of her daughter's identity. The lawsuit stated that she married in November of the 22nd year and gave birth to a daughter in May of the 24th year. Unfortunately, she died early. The mother-in-law thought it was unfavorable and called her daughter-in-law a "white tiger," which caused the relationship to break down. Before her husband, she extensively bewitched him. After becoming pregnant last winter, she unexpectedly falsely accused him of adultery with his cousin Hua Xungen in March of this year and forced him to divorce. However, it was found that she conceived during the continuation of the marital relationship, so it was actually the defendant's legitimate daughter, etc. Yesterday, the judge opened the court. The defendant was not present. The lawyer stated on his behalf that the plaintiff had committed adultery with his cousin Hua Shougen and was caught on the spot. The township chief and Bao chief mediated the divorce. The defendant fundamentally did not recognize this daughter and requested that the original lawsuit be rejected, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately said that the child's appearance resembled the defendant and could be examined. As for the adultery, it was completely falsely accused. Because the plaintiff was not on good terms with her mother-in-law, they deliberately locked the cousin in her room while the plaintiff was washing clothes outside and said it was adultery in order to divorce. The defendant's defense was completely empty talk, etc. The official ordered the defendant to be summoned to court for further questioning next time.</p>
<h3>### Tao Tingxuan Returns to China - Inspects Insurance Business in Europe and America</h3>

Since the establishment of the Taiping Insurance Company, Mr. Tao has been hired to preside over the insurance business in Shanghai.

In November of last year, he was sent to Europe and the United States to inspect by Mr. Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of the company, in order to learn from them. Mr. Tao went abroad for a year and first went to Switzerland, followed by England, France, America, Japan, and other countries, and inspected many insurance companies. All the famous Swiss reinsurance companies, British Lloyd's, Eagle Star, London Assurance, Sun Insurance, French Co. Assurance.

Mr. Tao is the first Chinese to receive this honor. It is known that the task has been completed and he returned to Shanghai yesterday. All the staff of the company believe that Mr. Tao's return from his inspection will enable him to use his experience to expand the company's business prospects.

<h3>### Ministry of Railways - Promotes New Statistical Policies - Promulgates Railway Statistical Rules - Convenes Training Meetings for Various Railways</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society said that the Ministry of Railways, in view of the fact that although there have been various statistics on railways in China in the past, they were not suitable for practical administration and improvement due to the imperfect system, specially appointed experts to sort out the ministry's statistics. Over the past few months, it has gradually taken shape. Recently, the Regulations on Railway Statistics of the Republic of China have been formulated. The content is divided into seven categories: business, transportation, locomotives, civil engineering, materials, finance, and general affairs. In addition to the regulations, more than 170 types of statistical forms for application at all levels of the ministry and railways are specified, all with explanations. The content is precise and can be used as a reference for railway statistics in China. The statistical regulations have been formally promulgated and will be implemented from January 1 next year.

In order to promote and supervise it, it has specially convened the statistical personnel in charge of various railways to the ministry to hold training courses, from December 15 to 19, for a period of five days. A total of 87 representatives from 14 major national, public, and private railways across the country attended. Vice Minister Zeng of the Ministry of Railways and Chief Secretary Pan delivered speeches respectively, and Wu Dajun, Director of the Statistics Bureau of the Accounting Department, came to guide everything. The meetings were then divided into groups, chaired by Dr. Wu Wenwei, Deputy Director of the Research Office of the Ministry.

Some of the members present stood up and said that since the general meeting could not be held, there was no need to hold the discussion meeting.

In addition to sending staff to notify, I am still afraid that it will not be fully informed, so I will issue another earnest notice. I hope that your company will check and pay attention to it.

This is a notice.</p>

<h3>### County Government - Urges Completion of Land Price Tax</h3>

<h3>Local Oil Supplies: No Fear of Shortages; Oil Tankers Unaffected by Strike</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that rumors have been circulating in Shanghai for days that due to the shipping strike on the Pacific coast, Shanghai's oil and by-products are already in short supply, and it may be difficult to purchase even twenty barrels of oil (yesterday, Saturday). However, major foreign companies with relevant connections have denied this. The "North-China Daily News" reportedly inquired with various oil companies about this matter. Their replies mostly stated, "If your newspaper requires oil, our company can supply it as much as possible." According to their claims, oil companies are not affected by the strike because oil tankers are different from ordinary cargo ships. Ordinary cargo ships require workers to load goods, while oil tankers only need to use pipes from the shore to pump oil into the ship. Furthermore, oil tankers mostly fly British and Norwegian flags, and their crews are not subject to the restrictions imposed by strikers on American ships. Additionally, there are large quantities of oil in the Dutch East Indies and other places that can be continuously transported to Shanghai. Therefore, factories, car dealerships, and other oil consumers in Shanghai do not need to worry about oil shortages.</p>

<h3>Famous Painter Ding Yunxuan Passes Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Yunxuan, a flower and bird painter from Wuxi, whose given name was Baoshu, and who was the elder brother of the famous doctor Ding Fubao, passed away at his residence in Shanghai on the 10th of this month at the age of 71. Mr. Ding was a former Qing Dynasty deputy tribute student. In his early years, he was close friends with Mr. Wu Zhihui, Sun Hanyai, Lian Nanhu, and others, and they often visited each other to discuss matters of great importance. Thirty years ago, he came to Shanghai and founded the Civilization Bookstore with Mr. Yu Zhonghuan. In middle age, he began to gain fame as a painter. He also served as a resident director of the Xijin Guild for over a decade. He suffered a stroke this spring and never recovered, eventually succumbing to it. Mr. Ding had one son and five grandchildren. His son, Dr. Xikang, has been working in the Shanghai Municipal Council's health department for many years. He recently returned from studying medicine in England this spring. His grandchildren are studying at major high schools and universities. Mr. Ding's remains are currently kept at the Xijin Guild. It is reported that the Xijin Guild and the Wuxi Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association will hold a memorial service for Mr. Ding on January 10th to express their respect and admiration.</p>
<h3>Coal Truck Accident Causes Tragic Death of Zi Gufang</h3>
<p>Gu Shigen (26 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 44, Zhongxing Lane, Zhoujiazui Road), a driver for the North China Coal Company at 412 Foch Road, was driving a No. 908 coal truck eastward on Avenue Edward VII from the French Concession at 7:30 PM on the 19th. As he approached the intersection of Moller Street, Cai Gufang, approximately 40 years old, a worker for the "Zhongzhou Daily," wearing a long gown, was crossing the road southward from the British Concession when he was struck by a railing on the truck. He fell into the British Concession. Chinese Constable No. 2205 of the British Police discovered the injured man and sent him to the Renji Hospital. Simultaneously, he reported to the French Police, who detained the truck driver. However, Cai Gufang died from his injuries before he could be treated. The French Police sent the body to the coroner's office, awaiting inspection by an investigator from the Special Second District Court today. The deceased was wearing an undershirt, a sanitary shirt, a blue striped cloth short gown, a pink woolen shirt, a fine striped padded jacket and pants, black cloth leggings, a camel-hair long robe, snuff-colored thread socks, and no shoes. He suffered fatal injuries to the back of his head, right forehead, and mouth.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Damaged by Coal Ship; Xian Shi Feng Small Tugboat Tows it to Tongzhou</h3>
<p>The Huangyan fishing boat "Jin Maotai Ou" No. 398, carrying wood from Fujian, arrived in Songhu on the 15th of this month. After inspection, it was scheduled to unload at the Longhe Company in Tongzhou. On the 16th, when it arrived near the second floating buoy in the Langshan River, it was suddenly struck by a certain coal ship coming from overseas to Shanghai. Due to careless navigation, the coal ship hit the fishing boat's bow, causing the cabin to flood, and the boat was about to sink. Fortunately, the crew was unharmed. Yesterday, they reported to the Xinjianchang Customs Brokerage, requesting them to arrange for a tugboat to rescue the boat. They also submitted a report to the Customs and Navigation Bureau to negotiate compensation for the losses from the coal ship. It is reported that the fishing boat had a load of over 1,500 dan, and the losses are quite significant.</p>

<h3>Electrical Appliance Manufacturing in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, Part 40)</p>
<p>1. Classification and History</p>
<p>The use of electricity for daily life in China is only about 30 years old. However, all the electrical materials needed for using electricity initially relied entirely on imports from overseas. In the past ten years or so, Chinese people have gradually been able to imitate and manufacture some of these materials. According to the numerous types of electrical materials, which are being invented and improved daily (such as wireless telephones and neon tubes, which are relatively recent inventions and were not commonly seen at first), they can be roughly divided into the following six categories: 1. Batteries and flashlights, mainly used for storing electricity; 2. Lighting electrical materials, such as light bulbs and insulated wires; 3. Household appliances, such as electric fans, electric stoves, electric irons, and electric cookers; 4. Electric motors and transformers; 5. Wireless radio equipment; 6. Neon light materials. Each of the six categories can form its own system in terms of manufacturing and functionality. Because the manufacturing process of the fourth category is more complicated, there are very few businesses in Shanghai that operate in this industry. The fifth category is almost entirely imported, and the sixth category is still an emerging industry. Therefore, this article will not cover these three. As for the first three categories, many electrical appliance manufacturers in Shanghai are engaged in production, especially light bulbs and batteries. Now, I will divide their history as follows:</p>
<p>1. Battery and Flashlight Manufacturing Industry——In the first year of the Republic of China, the Guohua Battery Factory was established on North Qujiang Road in Zhabei, specializing in the manufacture of various dry batteries. Later, the Ministry of Communications commissioned it to handle a large batch of batteries and instructed it to set up a factory in Pudong. In addition to dry batteries, it also manufactured storage batteries, which was the beginning of this industry in Shanghai. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the China Storage Battery Factory was established. After the Republic of China, Yipan, Guanghua, and Huimingxing factories were established one after another. To date, there are about 20 large and small battery factories. Almost all the dry batteries sold on the market are domestic products. Most of the flashlight categories are also manufactured concurrently, and the scale of manufacturers specializing in flashlights is very small, with capital of only a few thousand yuan.

<h3>The Desirable Trends in the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>As the world economy shifts from a period of panic to a period of depression, and recovers towards a path of normal prosperity, commodity prices generally rise, and purchasing power naturally increases. Consequently, silk, which had suffered seven or eight years of misfortune, has also embarked on a path of prosperity. In particular, the normalization of prosperity in the United States, which consumes 70-80% of the world's raw silk, has provided enormous support to the silk industry, stabilizing a situation that was previously precarious – most importantly, stabilizing silk prices. Whether prices can return to the level of one or two thousand taels per raw silk of the past is certainly a question. However, if we carefully consider the situation, we feel that the current silk price, centered around 700 yuan, can perhaps be maintained. At this price level, those engaged in the silk industry can largely sustain and continue their operations, and even have some modest profits to gain, if they can manage their businesses rationally. Therefore, Mr. Morimoto, of the Yokohama Trade News, who studies silk prices and other issues in Japan, advocates that Japanese silk production, which has been reduced for seven years, should regain its momentum and engage in increased production. This gives a new evaluation to the silk business, which was almost considered hopeless. This is quite a timely statement. (See "Sending Off the Era of Raw Silk Production Reduction" by Mr. Morimoto in the December issue of "Silk" this year.)</p>
<p>After reaching its peak in 1929, China's silk industry declined sharply and rapidly, falling into an extremely panicked and declining path. This was due, on the one hand, to the rapid advancement of rayon, which, coinciding with the world economic panic, became the darling of the times in textile fibers, substantially replacing the use of raw silk. On the other hand, it was also due to the dumping of Japanese silk, which squeezed out the position of Chinese silk in the international market, resulting in the loss of consumer markets and a sharp decline in exports. The decline in recent years is well known and need not be repeated. Since the first half of last year, after silk prices and silk sales reached their lowest point, silk prices gradually rose in the second half of the year, and exports increased sharply. Silk prices and sales this year have also been able to maintain a reasonably good condition. As a result, the precarious silk industry has regained its vibrant vitality.</p>
<p>However, it is very clear that although the silk industry is now showing signs of recovery, it ultimately cannot engage in production and management in the same way as in the past. Although the failures of the past were said to be due to external factors such as the attacks of rayon and Japanese silk, we cannot deny the existence of our own shortcomings and the exploitable opportunities they provided. The inherent problems of China's silk industry lie, on the one hand, in the ignorance and speculation of the operators, the so-called "adherence to conventions and resistance to change." On the other hand, we cannot deny the laissez-faire and destructive attitude of the ruling authorities, which led to the decline of the motherland of the silk industry. Among these, the conservatism of technology and the mismanagement of operations were naturally the main factors. Therefore, now that silk prices are relatively stable, the attitude of operators engaged in silk production should be one of scientific thinking and a determination to improve. By reflecting on the failures of the past and engaging in rational improvements, they can seize the current opportunities to revitalize our silk industry and restore the glory of its past history. If this self-improvement and awareness are linked to the government's regulation and improvement, then not only can the recovery of the silk industry be expected, but the restoration of its position as a world leader is not difficult. Although Japan's current production is about five or six times higher than ours.</p>
<p>However, the improvement of the silk industry itself is quite complicated because the production of silk goes through three processes—agriculture, industry, and commerce—to become a semi-finished raw material. Each process has different business characteristics, and there are some contradictions in terms of interests. For example, in the agricultural sector, the interests of the seed production industry and the silkworm rearing industry are not consistent, and the relationship between silkworm rearing and silk reeling industries is also becoming increasingly acute as silk factories increase their self-operated sericulture. Therefore, before discussing the improvements to be made in each industry, it should be specifically emphasized that the industries should unite and cooperate. Below, I would like to select the most important points of improvement to be made in the future from the three main production sectors of silk—the seed production industry and silkworm rearing industry in the agricultural sector, and the silk reeling industry in the industrial sector—and briefly describe my humble views. As for the cocoon trade and raw silk trade in the commercial sector: the former has been less generously rewarded in recent years due to the economic downturn, and silk factories generally self-operate cocoon collection, so cocoon merchants have been relatively reduced; and this trend will continue in the future, so in terms of its position, it has lost its importance. Moreover, the existence of the cocoon trade is actually a profit-making institution that mediates between the silkworm rearing industry and the silk reeling industry: on the one hand, it buys cocoons from farmers at low prices and then sells them to silk factories at high prices, extracting huge profits through a simple turnover. Therefore, the existence of the cocoon trade actually adds another layer of exploitation to silk production. From the standpoint of the development of the entire silk industry, we really have the hope and intention of seeing it collapse. For these reasons, I will not discuss it. As for the raw silk trade, it mainly refers to exporters, but since Hulim, Tongyun, and other companies successively went bankrupt, the raw silk export trade is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners. Although the Zhejiang Regulation Association has recently established a raw silk sales committee in Shanghai, it mainly promotes the sale of raw silk produced by the Regulation Association itself, and other matters are handled only by its own established institutions. Therefore, we have no other recourse but to do our best to hope that in the near future, there will be government sales agencies standing tall, to save the past abuses of price monopoly by others.</p>
<p>(II) The Desired Development Trends of the Seed Production Industry</p>
<p>Since the prosperous years of the silk trade in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the establishment of seed farms has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In Jiangsu Province alone, according to the Shenbao Yearbook of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there were 154 seed farms in the 20th year of the Republic of China, producing 2.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs. However, the operators of these seed farms at that time did not have confidence in the silk industry or harbor enthusiasm for improving silkworm breeds. Most of them were operating for profit. Seeing the abundant profits in seed production, people who had no connection with silk or no knowledge of seed production at all raised funds to operate seed farms. Of course, there were some truly enthusiastic people who regarded it as a career, but in terms of numbers, they were only a small minority. Because the operation of seed farms was mostly speculative in nature, their operating goal was only to be able to produce silkworm eggs for sale, which would mark the completion of their business. They absolutely did not ask or hear about the quality of the next generation of silkworms or how they performed after being sold to farmers. Therefore, abuses arose. Although the government had set up regulations to supervise and crack down on inferior breeds, the demons were always one foot higher than the Dao, and it was ultimately difficult to achieve the goal of preventing abuses. Problems such as a wide variety of breeds and careless breeding were commonplace. Some even falsely reported the number of newly hatched silkworms or purchased silkworm cocoons from farmers to produce silkworm eggs, in order to achieve the goal of gaining more profit. Because most operations were speculative, they did not pay attention to normal profit-making methods such as maintaining the reputation of good silkworm eggs to increase farmers' trust or promoting side businesses to increase production. As a result, countless farms went bankrupt in succession when the economic panic struck. Among them, only a few seed farms with relatively good reputations and relatively rational management were able to continue operating. The seed farms in Zhenjiang, managed by the China United Improvement Association, and the Dayou farm in Hushuguan are good examples. Now that the past is gone, we can look to the future. Now that silk prices are stable and seed prices and sales are regulated by the government, the operation of seed farms should absolutely break away from its speculative nature and engage in rational management. The so-called rational management means, on the one hand, striving to ensure that silkworm eggs are of good quality, the next generation of silkworms is strong, and the silk quality is good, in order to maintain and enhance the reputation of the seed farm. On the other hand, it means striving to save production costs, so as to reduce costs and increase production. In this way, sericulture can be stabilized and can adapt to the main points of low-cost silk production. In order to achieve the above goals, I believe that the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Eliminate the past speculative and purely commercial operations, and commit to coexisting and prospering with the silk industry, in order to engage in the production of silkworm eggs.</p>
<p>(2) Strive for complete equipment in order to provide the original silkworms with a good environment.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivate or select strong parent breeds with good silk quality, and breed them carefully, so that the next generation of silkworms can obtain good results. However, cocoon quality and silk quality are often contradictory. Therefore, given our current general environment and technology, in the spring season, we can slightly favor silk quality, while in the summer and autumn seasons, we should pay attention to the health of the silkworms.</p>
<p>(4) Establish a dedicated mulberry garden, and absolutely do not purchase mulberry leaves from outside for feeding, in order to avoid the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>(5) Promote summer silkworms and late autumn silkworms in order to increase the production of the seed farm itself and the farmers.</p>
<p>(6) Use idle time to operate side businesses, such as raising chickens, rabbits, sheep, and bees, to increase the income of the seed farm.</p>
<p>(7) When there is certainty about controlling viruses, ordinary seeds should abandon the cabinet-making method and use flat or scattered egg-laying seed production methods to reduce production costs.</p>
<p>(8) Try out the sub-farm system. Japanese seed farms have always adopted this system. It involves the operators of silkworm egg businesses having the original seeds bred by special farmers, and then gathering them to make seeds themselves, which can save a lot of fixed investment in silkworm rearing rooms and tools. This system can be tried out in places where the technical level of silkworm rearing is relatively high and the houses are suitable. This would allow for a large quantity of silkworm eggs to be obtained with a small amount of production costs. In the current situation of seed scarcity, this is certainly a good emergency solution; even in the future, because the amount of fixed capital invested is small, it can establish the foundation for low-cost silkworm egg production.</p>
<p>(III) The Desirable Trends of the Silkworm Rearing Industry</p>
<p>Generally speaking, China's mulberry planting and silkworm rearing industry has not yet reached the stage of specialization. Therefore, silkworm rearers must plant mulberry trees, and mulberry planters must rear silkworms. In the past, because silk cocoon prices were high and a large return could be obtained with short-term surplus labor, farmers flocked to the silkworm rearing and mulberry planting business. As a result, silkworm rearing income not only occupied a large position in farmers' economic income, becoming the only side business; it even sustained the livelihood of the whole family, becoming the main occupation for survival. The former is the case in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, while the latter is the case in Guangdong. At that time, whether farmers reeled the silk themselves or sold the cocoons, as long as sericulture was promising, they would gain double or more in profits. In this smooth situation, they were very indifferent to all improvement measures, and breeding native species led to the spread of viruses, making sericulture unstable. This was truly the root of the recent decline. After the 18th year of the Republic of China, due to the world economic panic and other reasons, silk cocoon prices plummeted. Even when silkworm cocoons were harvested, they could not be sold for a reasonable price. As a result, silkworm farmers suffered heavy losses, and countless people dug up mulberry trees and replanted other crops, simply viewing silkworm rearing as a dangerous path. When silk prices soared last year, fresh cocoons rose from a minimum of more than ten yuan per dan to maintain a price of around thirty yuan, the farmers' mentality gradually changed somewhat. However, if calculated according to the farmers' production costs, there are still some losses. I have made a detailed analysis and description of this point in my previous article "Silk Regulation and Cocoon Price Regulation." (See the commentary section of the Current Affairs News from July 3rd to August 2nd of this year.) Therefore, in the future, the silkworm rearing industry must not only avoid all dangerous operating methods, but also strive to reduce the production costs of silkworm cocoons in order to adapt to the goal of low-cost silk production. I will now list the points that should be improved according to my humble opinion:</p>
<p>(1) Use wasteland and hillsides to cultivate mulberry trees, and apply self-produced fertilizers, such as green manure and compost, to reduce the cost of mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>(2) Do not raise excessive amounts of silkworms. In the past, many people bought mulberry leaves or hired workers to raise silkworms, which not only resulted in cash expenditures, leading to high costs, but also affected sericulture, with many dangers. In the future, it is advisable to rely on self-grown mulberry trees and self-reliant silkworm rearing to avoid danger.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to technology and listen to guidance, breed improved varieties, and strive to absorb scientific breeding techniques in order to ensure the safety of sericulture and to increase production.</p>
<p>(4) Make greater use of the labor of women and children in order to avoid wasting useful labor.</p>
<p>(5) Intercrop mulberry orchards, such as planting leafy vegetables, to increase production.</p>
<p>(6) Organize cooperatives to resist and eliminate the exploitation and monopoly of middlemen through the united solidarity of silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>In summary, it is nothing more than (1) relying on self-supplied labor, (2) using low-cost mulberry leaves for production, and (3) seeking the safety of sericulture.</p>
<p>(IV) The Desirable Trends in the Silk Reeling Industry</p>
<p>In the past, the operation of the silk reeling industry, like other production sectors, was mostly speculative in nature. Because the operation of silk reeling was very profitable and did not require the huge capital investment of flour mills and yarn mills, general merchants were happy to invest in its operation. Since the operating motive was not for the sake of the industry, all kinds of operating methods focused on commercial profits and neglected industrial profits. Commercial profits, of course, can fluctuate greatly in an instant; industrial profits are not only smaller in amount, but also linked to the rationalization of management policies and the scientification of technology. In general, investors and operators are outsiders to technology. Therefore, they have to abandon the stable and reliable industrial profits and commercialize their management policies. Under this kind of circumstance, various abnormal phenomena naturally occur. The factory owners are not engaged in silk reeling, and the silk reeling operators mostly raise funds temporarily and rent factories to operate. The factory owners do not care about the improvement of equipment and technology, and the tenants feel it temporarily, so of course it is the same for decades. As long as the cocoons can be reeled into silk, it is considered that the goal has been achieved, and other matters are not asked or heard. What is the quality of the products under this kind of operation? It is not difficult for us to imagine. In this era of increasingly advanced science and the rising desire of human beings for material enjoyment, it is naturally expected that Chinese raw silk cannot gain a foothold in this world market, not to mention the attack of the economic panic, the leap forward of rayon, and the squeeze of Japanese silk in the world market.</p>
<p>As a result of the plummeting silk prices, the silk reeling industry is declining day by day. Among the two hundred or so silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there were at least only seven or eight factories in operation at the lowest point. It is unknown how many people went bankrupt as a result of operating the silk industry! The intensification of this decline truly set a precedent for the decline of various industries in recent years. Therefore, it goes without saying that we should seize the opportunity now and strive for regeneration. Below, I will try to list the principles that should be improved in the future according to my humble opinion:</p>
<p>(1) Reform the past commercial operating policies and take the industry as a premise, striving for the excellence of products and the establishment of reputation.</p>
<p>(2) Improve mechanical equipment and hire specialized technical personnel to engage in production.</p>
<p>(3) Self-operate cocoon collection, drying, and silk reeling in order to avoid the exploitation of middlemen on the one hand, and to ensure the quality of raw materials on the other.</p>
<p>(4) Operate all year round so that workers can work with peace of mind, which will increase efficiency, reduce production costs, and increase production.</p>
<p>(5) Use by-products, such as dry waste and wet waste, for processing to increase production.</p>
<p>(6) Contact various silk factories to strive for uniformity and consistency in quality.</p>
<p>In short, on the one hand, we must be able to produce a large quantity of raw silk at low cost, and on the other hand, the quality must be excellent in order to achieve the goal of "low price and good quality." This will not only maintain the raw silk market, but also expand the use of raw silk. As for the fraudulent behavior of using extremely inferior raw silk to impersonate superior products and shipping them to the United States last year due to the improvement in silk prices, resulting in returns and loss of credibility, should be absolutely avoided in the future, otherwise, it is truly cutting oneself off from others.</p>
<p>(V) Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, the silk business is a whole, with an organic structure. Therefore, on the one hand, we require that each production sector do its best to avoid conflicts and move forward quickly; on the other hand, we require that each industry be improved in proportion. Japan is vigorously calling for the "reconstruction of the silk industry system," which means that everyone in each industry should unite and cooperate with the common purpose of coexistence and co-prosperity. Although the production means and methods of each industry are different, their responsibility for producing silk is the same. Only through united cooperation can we achieve the effect of "low price and good quality" in silk production. If only one sector is improved, it will naturally be a case of achieving half the result with twice the effort, and the effect will be minimal. This is a key point that each industry should be particularly clear about. It is also a point that each industry should urgently be aware of. As for the government, on the one hand, it should stand on the position of advocating, encouraging, and urging in order to implement the regulation and management of the silk industry, eliminate or alleviate the contradictions between various industries, and help promote the unity and innovation between various industries. In addition, for businesses that benefit the future of the silk industry, such as silk industry experiments, the circulation of silk industry production finance, land reclamation and mulberry planting that are difficult for industries to operate or implement automatically, regional unified varieties, dry cocoon trading, unified silk brands and quality, and direct foreign sales, the government should strive to promote them; and if people cannot organize direct foreign sales, the government should invest in their operation, so that those engaged in the silk industry can establish the foundation for revival under the government's overall management and regulation.</p>
<h3>A Review of Food Control in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem of this year's good harvest, I proposed three methods in my article "Review of the Abundant Year Problem," published in issue 194 of this journal:</p>
<p>(1) In provinces with surplus rice, actively promote a simple warehousing policy to absorb surplus grain and weaken the threat of falling rice prices.</p>
<p>(2) In provinces with insufficient food, the local authorities should manage and control the transportation and sales, using the province's grain shortage as the standard for adding rice from other provinces.</p>
<p>(3) In provinces with self-sufficient rice, the local governments should manage the buying and selling of food.</p>
<p>In summary, the main purpose is to temporarily adopt emergency measures to solve the problem of abundant harvests this year, according to its different natures. Therefore, I finally advocated that "the whole country, from top to bottom, should work together in a division of labor, which implies internal and external mutual support, and achieve a balanced effect." However, from the beginning of this year's new goods entering the market, grain prices rose early and continued to rise afterwards, becoming increasingly high, beyond what we could have expected. This abnormal event naturally aroused the possibility of local authorities in various provinces dealing with the situation on the spot. Therefore, the authorities in various provinces implemented regional food controls one after another, which seemed to be in line with what I advocated earlier, but there were still areas for discussion. Although free circulation is still permitted in various provinces and cities after the central government promulgated the Provisional Measures for Food Regulation (November 25), the trend of the grain market is long-term, and it is not known what it will be like in the future. Therefore, there is still the possibility of re-examining the past facts and using them as a guideline for the future, which is described as follows:</p>
<p>II. The Lack of Food Control in Various Provinces</p>
<p>Since the problem of cheap grain relative to the price of harvest occurred one after another, the authorities in various provinces have taken quite positive measures to alleviate the severity of the problem. Now, the important provinces of the country are summarized into three categories: rice surplus areas, rice self-sufficient areas, and rice shortage areas. The authorities' policies and processes for dealing with the food problem are described separately as follows.</p>
<p>A. Rice Surplus Provinces</p>
<p>Hunan Province has always been the source of rice production. There is an old saying that "If Hunan and Guangdong are ripe, the world will be sufficient." After the full opening of the Yuehan Railway on September 1 this year, the provincial authorities were determined to improve the marketing methods to deal with the autumn harvest of Hunan rice. The authorities of the four provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei had already reached an agreement on economic cooperation. Therefore, when the Yuehan Railway was fully completed, the authorities of Hunan Province decided to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong for sale, and Guangdong would transport Guangdong salt to Hunan for sale, as a prelude to economic cooperation between the two provinces. After this case was decided, the authorities of Hunan Province, in order to facilitate the promotion of Hunan rice, consulted with the Construction Department and jointly established Hunan rice sales to Guangdong mortgage exchange by eleven banks, including Shanghai China, Communications, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Continental, Salt Industry, Central South, Guohua, Guohuo, and Postal Remittance Bureau. The total amount of the mortgage exchange was said to be 10 million yuan. It was stipulated that Hunan shippers would transport the goods to the designated location, and then submit the bill of lading, insurance policy, and invoice to the bank undertaking the mortgage exchange, and apply for a loan of 80% first. After the goods arrived at the destination, the buying and selling merchants would return the money to the bank and obtain the bill of lading to pick up the goods. The mortgage exchange interest rate would be determined according to the credit of the grain merchants. In general, the highest monthly interest rate should not exceed one point. At the same time, in order to improve the credit of Hunan rice, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to Hunan to establish a Hunan rice inspection office in Changsha. The Ministry of Industry formulated inspection regulations to provide free inspection of Hunan rice sold to Guangdong; those that did not meet the standards were not allowed to be transported to Guangdong for sale. On the Yuehan Railway side, in order to promote economic cooperation between Hunan and Guangdong, it has been stipulated that from November 1, all Hunan rice loaded in full cars at stations in Hunan Province for transport to Guangdong (same for Hubei) will be charged at 50% of the fifth-class ordinary freight rate; the freight cost for Hunan rice sold to Guangdong has been reduced by half.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province is an important agricultural area in the Yangtze River basin, and a large amount of rice is transported to other provinces every year; therefore, it is also a rice surplus province. There were good harvests of early and late rice this year. The provincial authorities had already decided to deal with this year's food problem by warehousing internally and transporting and selling externally. In terms of warehousing, it has been decided to divide the province into four agricultural warehouse mortgage loan areas, which will be handled by the province's Rural Cooperative Committee. The source of mortgage funds is to be directly mortgaged or entrusted by four banks, including China, Communications, China Farmers, and Jiangxi Yumin, in each loan area. As for transportation and sales, it was originally planned to open up outlets for Jiangxi rice in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces; however, because the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways have not yet reduced freight rates for Jiangxi rice, it is still necessary to consider transportation. Before the railway bureau reduces the freight rate for Jiangxi rice sold to Zhejiang, it was decided to start with Jiangxi rice to Hunan and Guangdong first; this move has been organized by both official and commercial parties, raising 500,000 yuan to form a government-supervised and privately-operated grain transportation and sales company to undertake the business of Jiangxi rice sales to Guangdong.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Securities: Last Week's Government Bonds Fluctuated with the Environment</h3>
<p>Monday Saw a Sharp Drop of Four Yuan to the Limit; Stabilized by the Banking Sector and Recovered; The Final Result Was Still a Decrease of Three, Four, Five, Eight, or Nine Jiao</p>
<p>The government bond market last week experienced sudden changes in the situation, and the market conditions were extremely turbulent. The occurrence of the Xi'an Incident shocked the market, leading to numerous rumors and a virtual disappearance of buyers. The market price was subjected to environmental pressure, and at the beginning of the week, it uniformly plummeted, exceeding four yuan and hitting the limit. Subsequently, people remained panicked, but with the strong support of the banking sector, the market situation began to recover and rebound. By the weekend, as environmental news eased, the market sentiment greatly improved, with short positions covering and new buyers emerging, showing great enthusiasm. The market price rebounded sharply, restoring the strong upward trend of the previous week. In the future, the environment will continue to change, and the bond market will therefore still experience abnormal fluctuations. The following is a detailed account of the entire week: On Monday, the Xi'an Incident occurred, causing extreme terror. The market price was driven by strong selling pressure, with buyers virtually absent, resulting in a uniform drop of four yuan, reaching the limit. Trading on the black market saw a further drop of one or two yuan. On Tuesday, the environment remained extremely serious, but due to the continued support of the banking sector, with many purchases, the market sentiment gradually stabilized. Market prices for various bonds, starting with Type E, uniformly rebounded by one to two yuan and two jiao. On Wednesday, the market situation fluctuated greatly. Initially, due to positive news about the situation, large investors absorbed heavily, and all bonds trended upward. However, later in the day, rumors of a central government order to suppress the rebels caused panic to resurface, and market prices fell by five jiao to one yuan and five jiao. On Thursday, the market was chaotic, and market sentiment was also uncertain. The competition between bulls and bears was fierce, and market prices rebounded by half a yuan to more than one yuan. On Friday, as the Xi'an Incident showed signs of resolution, market sentiment turned bullish. Large investors, such as those with numbers 10, 18, and 43, were actively covering short positions or turning bullish, and market prices uniformly surged by one to two yuan. On Saturday, the news became even more positive, and market sentiment greatly improved. Large investors absorbed enthusiastically, and market prices continued to rise by about half a yuan in the midst of the chaos. Overall, the week resulted in a drop of three, five jiao to nine jiao and a half across the board, while Type A bonds rose by five fen this month. The total volume of transactions was 13,194,000 yuan. The following table compares the fluctuations and highs and lows: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Few New Buyers from Outside the Industry; Difficult for American Cotton to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a drop of one pound/inch to a rise of six pounds/inch across various months. All short covering and minor long liquidation were absorbed by domestic and foreign counterparts. There were few new buyers from outside the industry, and the market had a holiday atmosphere. The rise in various commodity prices had no impact here, and the market is currently stagnant, with firm support. Over the week, cloth sales were below production volume, and the stock market was weak, leading to long liquidation and a softening of market prices. Spot prices rose by one pound/inch, while futures fell by two pounds/inch to a rise of three pounds/inch. Spot prices for British cotton rose by four points, and futures rose by one point. Indian cotton benefited from strong spot prices, with sporadic purchases from traders and the public, with Bengal rising by 2 to 2.5 rupees, Oomra rising by half a rupee, and Broach rising by 0.25 rupees. (Dated 19th)</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 21st was Broach at 222 rupees, Oomra at 201.75 rupees, and Bengal at 167.75 rupees, all unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains: Thin Rice Arrivals Are the Only Active Sector</h3>
<p>(Yesterday, the sources of goods from various guilds in South Shanghai were scarcer than before, with a total of over 70 vessels arriving, carrying a total of 14,700 to 14,800 shi. Among them, thin rice accounted for over 40 vessels, and sales were still active in this street. Demand for wrapped rice was slow and stagnant. It is estimated that guilds from Pingjin and Qingyan sold over 5,000 packages of thin rice. Fortunately, the market was still tight due to limited supply, and sellers were firm due to domestic costs, so thin rice prices remained stable without gains or losses. Thick japonica wrapped rice was not traded, with only small-scale transactions. The market trend remains unchanged, and future trends will depend on arrivals and sales. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan are all settled.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 40 vessels arrived from various routes along the river. Sales of various goods in the market were still decent. White japonica high-grade prices remained stable. Mid-grade goods were priced very closely at a discount of 35 fen. Yang Du Bu Xian continued to sell in small quantities, and prices were also closely discounted. Baiyuan was sold in small quantities, and prices increased by 78 fen. Demand for thin rice wrapped in packages was slow and limited, and the market in this street was average. Top-quality goods in the market were firm, while mid- to low-quality goods were weak. Prices of other goods did not fluctuate much compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Two Batches of Nanfeng Tangerines Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nanfeng tangerines, a tribute of past dynasties, are not easily tasted by the general public. In recent years, they have been shipped to Shanghai for sale by the Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank in cooperation with Jiangxi Cooperatives, and are very popular among tangerine lovers. A batch was shipped last month and sold at major companies in this city, and soon sold out. Recently, another batch has been shipped from the original production area in Jiangxi, with better quality and sweeter taste than the previous batch. This is a good opportunity for tangerine lovers. The supply is limited, so don't miss it. It is reported that the general distribution office is located at the Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank on Xin Kaihe Road, and sales are also available at the four major companies such as Guanshengyuan, Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun, as well as major fruit stores.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Shanghai Price Index Rises (3)</h3>
<p>(4) Cost of Living Index: The overall index is 114.9, an increase of 0.8% compared to the previous month, and an increase of 5.2% compared to the same month last year. Compared to the previous month, among the five categories of indices, only rent and miscellaneous items remained unchanged, while clothing rose sharply, food rose slightly, and fuel fell slightly. The clothing category saw a sharp increase in the prices of various cotton cloths, resulting in a sudden increase of 8.2% in the index. The food category rose by 0.6%. The price of white rice fell slightly due to the continuous arrival of late rice. Spinach, radish, and fresh fish also fell in price. However, vegetables, scallions, sweet potatoes, hairtail fish, and edible salt trended strongly upward. The increase and decrease offset each other, and the index still rose slightly. The fuel category fell by 0.9%, mainly due to the weakening of market prices for coal balls and kerosene.</p>
<p>The following table compares the indices for each category this month with the indices for the previous month and the same month last year (1926 as 100%).</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Show Progress; Regrettably, Tea Exports to Russia Sharply Decrease; International Tea Industry Competition Intensifies</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the export volume of Chinese tea in November was: green tea 1,700.41 metric tons, black tea 7,875.71 metric tons, and other teas 910.42 metric tons, totaling 12,486.54 metric tons. This is an increase of over 2,000 metric tons compared to the 12,043.069 metric tons in the same month last year. The total number of eleven months of this year is 225,725.03 metric tons, compared with 209,626.79 metric tons in the corresponding period last year, it also increased by more than 16,000 tons. However, because the export of brick tea to Russia this year decreased by more than 28,000 metric tons compared with last year, after offsetting, it is still short of more than 12,000 metric tons. From the perspective of operation, the export of Chinese tea this year has indeed made considerable progress, but the competition in international tea trade is becoming increasingly fierce. For example, Japanese tea is being dumped in Africa in an attempt to break China's only Chinese green tea market. The Soviet Union is actively planting tea trees for the purpose of self-sufficiency and abandoning foreign tea. The abolition of production agreements by India, Ceylon, and Java gradually restored the original competitive production. All of these are sufficient to reduce the sales of Chinese tea, so the future of the Chinese tea industry that relies on foreign firms is worrying. The following is a list of export statistics for November. Silk and Tea</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Tai Xuan)</p>
<p>Contentment and a sense of shame are the fundamental principles for every individual to live and conduct themselves in the world. Let's take the example of taking and giving in contentment. Whatever one deserves within their duty is naturally worthy of acceptance, while whatever one does not deserve within their duty should not be taken at all. Because fame, sensual pleasures, and material interests are humanity's greatest desires, they are also humanity's greatest enemies. Throughout history, countless heroes and outstanding individuals have been sacrificed on this altar. As Mencius said, "To eat from a table ten feet square, with hundreds of concubines attending, I would not do it even if I achieved my ambitions." This was indeed Mencius' observation of the luxurious and dissolute behavior of those in authority at the time, and a portrayal of humanity's inability to be content.</p>
<p>A sense of shame, on the other hand, is the best stimulus for progress. Because a person with even a slight sense of integrity, when subjected to considerable humiliation, can never remain silent and passive. They will inevitably be motivated by a sense of shame and enter an environment of striving for self-reliance and self-improvement to struggle and wash away this shame. The ancients said, "Knowing shame is close to courage." This courage is born from the word "shame."</p>
<p>In this day and age, everyone should be content, and everyone should have a sense of shame. This is the fundamental principle for the Chinese of today to live and conduct themselves in the world!</p>
<h3>Where Can Savings Be Made?</h3>
<p>— Dai Zhongxin</p>
<p>At the front, soldiers fight in snow and ice, looking to the rear for assistance. While many people in the rear are enthusiastically contributing, there are also quite a few who only care about themselves and are unwilling to help. They all say they have no money, but where can savings be made? For example:</p>
<p>The new and fancy hot water bottles on the market are so beautiful, and the price is also very cheap. But my one from last year hasn't broken yet. Although the color is a bit faded, it can't be seen if wrapped in a handkerchief. Let's just make do with it!</p>
<p>It's not very cold yet. The coal stove in the room is quite pungent. Let's stop it for a few days and relight it later.</p>
<p>The New Year is coming soon. Let's see if we can find the New Year cards we bought last year and use those old ones! If it's not enough, we can send a few less!</p>
<p>The price of cotton is particularly high this year. Cotton batting costs half a dollar per pound. I originally wanted to make a new quilt, but let's wait until the price of cotton drops next year!</p>
<p>The medicinal plaster hasn't been decocted yet. Last year's prescription isn't good anymore, which is really troublesome! Well, medicinal supplements are not as good as food supplements. Let's just buy some meat to eat instead.</p>
<p>The newly released silk velvet is better than Vienna and is a genuine domestic product. It would be best to buy a bolt to make a shirt. No, I don't know if it's durable or not, or if it gets stiff after washing. Let's cut five feet of material to make one piece first. If it's durable, we can cut more next year.</p>
<p>Mingdi sent a letter saying that they each have to donate one dollar. Ling'er also has to donate thirty cents in school. These can't be saved. Let's just buy one less piece of cured meat. We can't not give them this money.</p>
<p>We got paid today. How about going to see Little Orphan Annie at the Grand Theater tonight? No, it's so cold at night! Who wants to go out to see a movie at eight or nine o'clock!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>If you think like this often, where can't you save money to support the front-line soldiers who are fighting for the nation's glory?</p>
<h3>Huang Yingbai and Zhuang Songfu</h3>
<p>— Qian Da</p>
<p>National Government member Huang Yingbai passed away on the 6th of this month after a prolonged illness with liver cancer. Mr. Huang had a long history of service to the party and the nation and was a close friend of Mr. Chen Ying'shi. He served as Chen's chief of staff, which shows the closeness of their relationship. However, many people may not know who introduced Mr. Huang to Mr. Chen initially. It was Mr. Zhuang Songfu of Fenghua, the former legislator and deputy director of the Huai River Commission. Mr. Zhuang was honest and upright and remained clean and self-disciplined throughout his life. He initially established the New Society in Shanghai to engage in revolutionary work. Revolutionary leaders such as Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Chen often gathered there for discussions. Although ostensibly a bookstore, it was actually a revolutionary organization. Mr. Huang was close to Mr. Zhuang from a young age, and their friendship was very deep. Later, when Mr. Huang was ordered by the Qing court to go south to investigate the situation of the southern revolution, Mr. Zhuang was assisting Mr. Chen in the revolution. When Mr. Huang arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Zhuang immediately went to persuade him. He then introduced him to Mr. Chen. Mr. Huang had long been inclined toward revolution and had great admiration for Mr. Chen, so they became close friends at first sight. Mr. Huang then assisted Mr. Chen in achieving countless great accomplishments, which was not what the Qing court had expected. Mr. Zhuang established the Linmu Company in Yuyao and worked tirelessly to manage it. He often traveled between Shanghai and Hangzhou and sometimes returned to his hometown of Fenghua. Whenever Mr. Huang was in Shanghai, Mr. Zhuang would visit him for long chats. This was because both men were indifferent to fame and wealth, self-disciplined in frugality, and had quite a few things in common in their personalities. Mr. Huang had a sworn brotherhood with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and often received his advice and planning. The late Chairman Yang Changqing of Hubei, who was assassinated, was able to serve Chairman Chiang thanks to Mr. Huang's recommendation. Now that he has suddenly passed away at the young age of fifty-seven, the party and the nation have lost another great statesman. This is a great loss to the future of the country, so the news of his death has shocked and mourned all who knew him and those who did not. Mr. Zhuang has a very close personal relationship with Chairman Chiang and is a revolutionary elder of Fenghua. He is now seventy-seven years old and still as energetic as a young man. He has always been praised for his integrity and honesty, and it is quite remarkable that he has accumulated little wealth despite holding high office. Now that Mr. Huang has passed away, Mr. Zhuang has lost an old friend, and his heart must be filled with great sadness. I have known Mr. Zhuang for a long time, and whenever he comes to Shanghai, I visit him. He is very knowledgeable in the study of Confucius and once co-authored a book on the sacred sites of Confucius with me, which is still being published by the New Society.</p>
<h3>Two First Lines</h3>
<p>This time, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, Lu Jingshi, Yan Fuqing, Pang Jingzhou, Luo Youxuan, Wang Shoufa and other eight people took a plane to Suiyuan to comfort the front-line soldiers. Among the 100,000 yuan they carried, 5,000 yuan were allocated to the wounded soldiers who conquered Bailing Temple this time. They first went to Xi'an and then to Luoyang on their way back, flying a total of ten thousand miles, reaching a height of fourteen thousand feet. Looking up at the sky, yellow sand covered the sun. Looking down at the ground, the mountains were heavily layered. They passed Wanquan County near Zhangjiakou and left the Great Wall for thousands of miles. Yesterday I met Xiaolai and Renzhi, both of whom had drafted the first line of a couplet and asked me to solicit the second line for them. One line has as many as eleven characters embedded in each sentence, and the other embeds the names of Lu and Pang and also has two idioms. It is indeed not easy to respond. Therefore, I specially submit them to this newspaper. Comrades at home and abroad, if you wish to submit a response, please send it directly to Sun Choucheng, No. 16, Longmen Road, Edward Road, Shanghai. There is no need to send it to the newspaper office to avoid delays. (1) With a hundred thousand in cash, comforting hundreds of thousands of troops, flying ten thousand miles, crossing ten thousand mountains, over ten thousand feet high, passing Wanquan, leaving the Great Wall for ten thousand miles, risking ten thousand dangers, just to have four hundred million compatriots, united as one to save the country. (2) Starting with Xi'an, ending with Luoyang, "Eastern and Western Capitals" (idiom), Lu Jingshi, Pang Jingzhou, "Zhou had eight scholars" (idiom).</p>
<h3>The Lovebirds Switch Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Pledge of Allegiance with a Cup of Water, Green Lamp Talks of Weariness; Hooked Gold Ring Signals a Red Bean's Yearning</p>
<p>No wonder his letters were full of melancholy. However, the melancholy he harbored, his history of hatred and shame, he couldn't reveal a single word to anyone. Naturally, he couldn't tell a newly acquainted friend. He was just estimating it that way, forgetting where he was. He took the folding fan in his hand, opened it and fanned himself, then folded it and held it in the palm of his hand, just looking up at the sky. After a long, long time, he shook his head twice. Behind him, Aunt Liu interjected, saying: Sir, aren't you going out? Guoqi turned his head and smiled at her, saying: I feel hot, I'm not going. Aunt Liu smiled: Since it's so hot, how did you put on a long gown in the house? Guoqi exclaimed and hurriedly took off his long clothes, smiling: After meeting the guest, I thought about going out again, so I forgot to take off the gown. So he grabbed his short undershirt with his left hand and used the folding fan in his right hand to vigorously fan his chest. Aunt Liu stood at the door, looking at him, and asked with a smile: Sir, you were just wearing a long gown, standing here, just thinking about something. You were holding the fan in your hand, not moving at all. Now that you've taken off the long gown, it's even hotter than before. Guoqi said: You who do rough work, how would you know. When a scholar thinks of writing an article, he doesn't feel the cold in the snow and ice, and doesn't feel the heat in the hot sun. Aunt Liu seemed to understand his meaning very well, smiled at him, and walked away. But from this afternoon onwards, he really lived up to that saying, not knowing heat, nor knowing hunger and thirst, just sitting blankly in the rattan chair by the desk. Aunt Liu repeatedly entered and exited from here, not caring at all. Later, after about two hours, seeing Guoqi sitting still, still in the same posture, she stopped far away and stared at his face for a while, then asked: Sir, are you feeling unwell? Guoqi still raised his head, looking at the sky outside the window. After Aunt Liu asked him twice in a row, he finally woke up, turned his head and smiled: Do I look like I'm sick? Isn't your question strange? Aunt Liu ran into a nail, didn't dare to say anything more, and walked away. After a while, Old Mrs. Zhang called outside the door: Guoqi, are you thinking about writing another article in the room? Guoqi exclaimed and stood up. Old Mrs. Zhang walked into the room and looked around the room. She then asked with a smile: You really are a bookworm. On such a hot day, you can't do without a fan in any place. What are you thinking about just sitting in the room? (112)</p>
<h3>Reviving Chao Mountain Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Chao Mountain in Zhejiang is famous for its plums. The total annual harvest of plums is over 20,000 dan. The production of other fruits such as peaches, plums, apricots, bayberries, and cherries is also quite significant. Every year in May and June, Qingyan (salt) dealers from Shanghai and Suzhou send special commissioners to purchase them, amounting to millions of dollars. Yuelai of the Shanghai City God Temple and Zhang Changman of Suzhou Shantang Street can be considered giants in this field. Recently, the production of mountain fruits has increased year by year, but the appetite of the dealers has decreased. This is because the price of sugar has soared, the interest is meager, and after the September 18th Incident, sales in the northeastern provinces have stopped completely. Since then, the production and sales sides have failed to reconcile, and there has been an oversupply. Villagers have not been able to profit from tree fruits, so they have planned to cut down trees and plant other species. It is a pity that such a good agricultural product is allowed to decline. Recently, the industrialist Xie Guansheng noticed this and consulted with friends to raise funds to revitalize it. Chao Mountain plum fruit has always been in great demand for the production of preserved plum by Guanshengyuan, so there is no excess inventory. For other fruits, Mr. Xie decided to adopt fresh fruits for the method of candied fruit, setting up factories locally for manufacturing. At the same time, scientific methods are incorporated, utilizing vacuum to place them in cans, which can preserve the fresh taste and avoid the drawbacks of stale. It is heard that the salt industry's veteran technician Mr. Jin has been hired to lead the effort and is preparing to start manufacturing in Chao Mountain, Tang Lou and other places next summer after various fruits are ripe. With Mr. Xie's skillful management, it will not be difficult to develop畅销, which is beneficial to agricultural profits and can promote agricultural products. This is a good news.</p>
<p>It is also heard that both railway bureaus are currently planning special trains to Chao Mountain to view the plum blossoms, planning to have meals and chats in the plum garden of Guanshengyuan in Chao Mountain. At that time, visitors will gather, and the elegant mood will be profound, with a special kind of cold interest.</p>

<h3>Britain's Rat Catching Expert</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>There is an old man in London named Dalton, who is a rat catching expert in Britain and can be considered one of the busiest people in London. Considering his age, he could very well stay at home to enjoy life and let his three sons take over his business, but he is still energetic and unwilling to give up this profession. Speaking of this profession, it has a secret that has been passed down from father to son in the Dalton family since 1790, not to outsiders. Dalton has been opening a rat catching business in London for 10 years, and in addition to his three sons, he has hired sixteen relatives as helpers. These twenty people are called out every night to catch rats. Their scope of activity is not only in London, but their footprints are all over the British Isles. The most important offices and homes in Britain have contracted with Dalton to catch rats on a regular basis. The total number they catch each week averages between eight hundred and one thousand. Dalton recently talked about the rat catching business with a representative of the Observer, saying: There are not many people in Britain who have the expertise to catch rats. Rats are cunning, and it is difficult to catch them if you do not know their nature. The rate at which rats are increasing in Britain is alarming. Last year, he and his team caught a total of 56,000 rats, 16,000 of which were caught in London. According to his estimates, the number of rats in London has increased by no less than 15,000 in three years, of which nine out of ten are ship rats that sneaked ashore at night when ships from all over the world docked in London. The old black rats in Britain have almost been exterminated by the large rats or sewer rats that came from Norway. Sewer rats are also the enemies of ship rats. The largest rat he caught weighed two pounds and six and a half ounces. Although Dalton makes a living by catching rats, he thinks highly of rats, saying that the little things have big brains and are extremely sensitive. Dalton does not believe that rats can transmit diseases, saying that he has never spent a penny on medicine in his life, and people do not know that rats are very clean, they often rub their bodies to keep clean. Dalton is also proud that all the rats he catches, except those that are smoked out of their homes with gas, are alive and unharmed. Every week he uses a painless method to kill the rats he catches in a home near Polo Road. It is estimated that he has killed several million rats in his life. The London authorities have recently implemented a plan to eradicate rats because the value of the goods destroyed by rats each year is very high. According to Dalton, those plans are ineffective. Rats will escape from telegraph wires, chimney pipes, and door cracks, so going door-to-door to catch them in rat-infested areas is a waste of effort. As long as a pair of rats escape, they will increase to a thousand in a year. Dalton then boasted: "Only I can deal with this problem." Dalton's two main points are that before a house is demolished, someone must be sent to catch all the rats inside to prevent them from escaping during demolition. Second, garbage from households in the city should be collected at night instead of in the morning to cut off the rat's food supply. Dalton lived a very happy life thanks to his rat catching skills.</p>
<p>Personality Sketches</p>
<h3>Record of the Recent Higher Examination Winner Yu Hanliang</h3>
<p>— Yi Liu</p>
<p>Success in examinations has always been difficult since ancient times. Out of hundreds or thousands of people, only those who take risks and are lucky can succeed, which is no different from snatching a pearl from a dragon's jaw. If they succeed, even if they are at the bottom of the list, they are surprised by the fortuitous event. If they are at the top, it is even rarer in the world. Therefore, in the era of imperial examinations, when a scholar first donned the blue gown, the villagers would spread the news and compete to treat him as a rare and respected person, regarding him as extraordinary. If they were to pass the provincial and metropolitan examinations consecutively, and return home in silk robes, people would be astonished as if seeing a celestial being, not daring to look directly. Among them, if one topped the rural, metropolitan, and palace examinations, fellow examinees would flatter him, and city dwellers would compete to watch, the pomp and glory being indescribable. Those who topped all three examinations were even recorded by the state as an auspicious sign, and such a person was rarely seen in any era. This is because, out of hundreds or thousands of people, betting on the slimmest chance is already extremely difficult, let alone topping the list among hundreds or thousands, or winning consecutive first places. In recent years, the examination system has been reformed, transforming the grand imperial examinations into practical applications. The nation's policies have been renewed, the people's wisdom has been widely disseminated, and education in schools has also become widespread. The tides of civilization are constantly advancing. Youngsters studying diligently are now commonplace throughout the country, instead of being considered exceptional talents. As the number of scholars increases, so does the demand for their services. Therefore, they rush to take exams, competing like sardines, and the urgency to succeed increases, making success even more difficult. Thus, the honor of passing an examination far surpasses that of the past, and what more of those who stand alone at the top, striding confidently on the path to success? When the list of examinees was first announced, the top candidate was Zhu Leizhang, whose subsequent performance was outstanding, shaking the times. Now he has already risen to become a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and his indictments are fearless, with a strict and upright style that is admired in his time. However, Zhu only stood out in one examination, with no other distinguishing achievements. If we consider Yu Hanliang, who topped the education administration department in the recent higher examination, his attainments are so extraordinary and his being listed so exceptional, that it cannot be compared to the selection of scholars in previous years, nor can it be measured by the standards of past examinations. He can truly be called the crown of scholars, a rare encounter in many generations. Yu is short, lean, and vigorous, with a deep, resolute, and dignified demeanor. Although he is not yet thirty, his erudition resembles that of a venerable scholar. He is respectful in his interactions, without feigning lofty arguments, yet his reasoning is brilliant, embodying the concept of Wang Xizhi's profound understanding achieved without words. He hails from Chongming, Jiangsu, and came to Shanghai to attend the provincial Shanghai High School. From the entrance examination to graduation, he consistently topped his peers. Later, due to financial constraints, he dropped out of school and taught at the municipal Gaoqiao Primary School in Gaoqiao District, Shanghai. He loves learning and studies diligently, never wasting time. In his spare time, he devoted himself to self-study, examining all subjects related to practical governance, researching and studying assiduously, oblivious to the cold and heat. He once took the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Service Examination and was recommended first, but declined the position of county magistrate three times, lamenting, "A man should seek high office with extraordinary talent; why bother with this insignificant position?" So he continued teaching as before. Subsequently, he took the Shanghai Municipal Examination and again emerged as the champion. He went to the capital to take the Higher Examination and passed with top honors. When the official results were announced, Yu once again topped the list. Alas! This is truly extraordinary! After the list was announced, the examiners praised Yu's outstanding performance and specially summoned him for commendation. The vice-president, Niu, even credited Zheng, the principal of Shanghai High School, adding to the tale of this admirable success. In summary, from primary school to the Higher Examination, Yu has participated in dozens of examinations, always ranking first, never considering being second. This is something difficult for ancient sages and rarely seen in history. Is this perhaps an auspicious omen for the country? On the day he went to Beijing, Yu happened to buy an airline ticket, and after the list was announced, the ticket was sold. Both fame and fortune arrived, a rare stroke of luck. How extraordinary! According to the academy's rules, those who rank high are given priority for appointments in government departments. In the future, we will wait and see how Yu spreads his wings and manages affairs in the government.</p>

<h3>Christmas and the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Seeing so many advertisements for children's toys in the newspaper, I realized that the so-called "Christmas" is coming soon.</p>
<p>On the eve of Christmas, Western children and those who are almost Western usually have a dream, dreaming that Santa Claus smiles and climbs down the chimney of the fireplace, giving them many candies and toys. When they wake up, sure enough, the candles on the Christmas tree have been extinguished, and many candies and toys are piled up in front of their beds. Looking back at their parents, they are sleeping soundly, with paper hats brought back from masquerade balls strewn on the floor.</p>
<p>Such happiness can naturally be enjoyed by children from at least middle-class families; poor children have no share in it. However, there are exceptions, such as the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly," which, as the name suggests, is specially for "suffering children" to "enjoy themselves."</p>
<p>According to the reports, this year's Christmas "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly will be held simultaneously in seven major theaters. The program includes "spreading happiness and encouraging the upward spirit of suffering children" and "various recreational performances to aid interest," as well as "candy distribution at the end of the assembly." Suffering children struggle with food and clothing throughout the year, and rarely have such an opportunity to watch recreational performances and eat candy. Naturally, they are flattered and extremely grateful. Having already passed my childhood, and having never participated in such an assembly when I was young, I cannot say what the "suffering children" feel at the moment the assembly is declared over. Judging from reason and emotion, they probably feel that the good times are too short and wish they could continue "enjoying themselves," right? Even I, who have passed my childhood, feel a kind of unspeakable regret when I think of the scene when the assembly is declared over.</p>
<p>But the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly cannot but end eventually. After it ends, those suffering children still have to live their vagrant lives. Although they "enjoyed themselves" for a while, they fall back into the ice cellar after "enjoying themselves."</p>
<p>Naturally, in the sense that "something is better than nothing," the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly has its meaning. After all, it does allow the "suffering children" to have some fun! Compared to "high-sounding words," the suffering children still get to eat some candy. Such a reason may not be wrong at first glance, but I cannot agree with it. I dare not say that the motive of the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly is not for the "suffering children's" enjoyment, but there are other reasons. Even if it is purely for the children's enjoyment, I feel that administering an anesthetic is a sin if the illness cannot be cured. If it is only to reduce pain, because the pain makes the patient aware of their illness, and sometimes they are almost the same as ordinary people, then the intention is naturally even more questionable. If, when administering the anesthetic, one also wants to make the patient feel a sense of goodwill towards the practitioner, then the practitioner naturally considers it a success, but the patient will not be eager to seek treatment because there is occasionally a painkiller available, causing the illness to linger. The result will inevitably be the patient's death!</p>
<p>The suffering children emerge from the "Joy with the Suffering Children" Assembly, and they are probably quite grateful to "God" and his representatives. In addition to being battered by wind and snow, in their childish minds, they will forever remember the "God's" maxims and hope that "God" will come to rescue them, right?</p>
<h3>Snowfield</h3>
<p>— Yego</p>
<p>I had been living in this village for only a few days when I heard that wild tigers and wolves from the mountains often came to disturb the livestock at night. The villagers patrolled the village, but found no footprints, and no one heard any howls. However, the landlords' pigs and sheep often disappeared from the pigpens without a trace, sometimes leaving only a pool of blood.</p>
<p>When the sun came out in the morning, everyone gathered at Scholar Hong's school to bask in the sun. And so, various strange legends and new discoveries emerged. Someone immediately said: The tiger came last night, and the reason why it did not harm the livestock was entirely because I saw it in the moonlight and secretly fired a shot at it from the upper floor of the Shi Building.</p>
<p>People were captivated by this fantastic narrative.</p>
<p>"So what happened afterwards?..."</p>
<p>"I didn't see clearly at that time, the moon was covered by clouds," the narrator said, excitedly waving his hands, with spittle flying in all directions. "I only saw it roar once, do a somersault on the ground, and then scurry towards the mountain."</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard it too, it was a very terrifying sound."</p>
<p>"I'm sure it must have been injured, otherwise why would it have rolled on the ground..."</p>
<p>Sighing tones burst forth from the mouths of more than ten people. Those who had not heard it could only admit that they had heard it, seeing that others were speaking so earnestly. Those who did not believe it could only nod and believe it. Based on their fantasies, based on memories from dreams, they pictured in their minds the fierce tiger, roaring, and having done a somersault on the ground.</p>
<p>Here, I often met a quiet, middle-aged farmer. He was more interested in the tiger's affairs than anyone else, but he offered fewer opinions than anyone else. Ten years ago, he came to this village carrying a bundle wrapped in a kerchief, lodging in the Land God Temple. During the day, he went around the landlords' houses to see if there was any short-term work to do, and at night he went back to the damp room in the Land God Temple to rest, living according to a fixed routine, as peacefully as a machine. During this time, a major event also occurred. At that time, a landlord discovered that some gold ornaments belonging to his concubine were missing. They speculated about the thief, and unanimously concluded that it was the tenant farmer sleeping in the Land God Temple, because he was poor and often visited their house. So, the Land God Temple was searched, and he was tied up like a sacrificial offering and hung in the landlord's haystack. The next day, he was sent to the district.</p>
<p>Before long, he was released because the concubine who had lost the gold ornaments, unable to bear the guilt, ran away. By this time, everyone knew that the thief was not the tenant farmer, but the landlord's concubine, who had given her gold ornaments to her lover.</p>
<p>After being released, he continued to live in the Land God Temple as before. What was different was that he no longer went around people's houses. Sometimes, when people came to call him, he refused, claiming that he was busy. He became lazy, quiet, and melancholic, often shutting himself up in the Land God Temple all day without saying a word. Sometimes, when he met landlords on the road, whether they were acquaintances or strangers, he would avoid them from afar, waiting until they had walked far away before coming out of hiding, spitting hatefully, expressing his disgust.</p>
<p>When everyone was excitedly caught up in the tiger's story, he sat so indifferently in a remote, inconspicuous corner, sucking powerfully on his pipe. But someone asked him:</p>
<p>"Old Baldy, have you seen the tiger?"</p>
<p>He widened his eyes, stared intently at the other person, stood up without any expression, waved his hand, and walked away.</p>
<p>One night, I had not yet fallen asleep when I was suddenly startled by a series of gongs and machine gun sounds. I hurriedly put on my clothes and got out of bed, grabbed a weapon at random, and ran out the door. Outside the house, a crowd of farmers was running about, holding flashlights and clutching rifles. I stood at the door for a while, grabbed an acquaintance, and asked what was happening. I learned that the tiger had come down the mountain again to bite the landlords' pigs and was now being chased up the mountain.</p>
<p>The entire hillside was covered with white snow, and the moonlight shone brightly in the sky. In the snowfield, there was a large black spot running, followed by dozens of black spots chasing. Gunshots rang out in succession, piercing the cold night air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the large black spot swayed for a while on the snowfield and then stopped moving. Immediately, shouts and volleys of gunshots followed, echoing across the landscape. We walked slowly, and when we arrived, the dead tiger had already been captured. Pushing through the astonished crowd, I learned that the fierce tiger that had disturbed people for months, preventing them from resting peacefully, was actually the tenant farmer sleeping in the Land God Temple, disguised in a tiger skin.</p>
<p>Everyone marveled for a while! And then turned and walked away. At that time, the snowflakes fell again.</p>

You shattered my soul. An ocean of blood and tears. Oh. Human deception. Seizing and tearing, cold and insidious. Flood and wilderness. My eyes are suddenly blinded. My eyes are suddenly blinded. I cannot see the sun of the East, nor the moon of the West. In this gloomy darkness. Everything is destroyed and perished. Everything is destroyed and perished. Perished.</p>

The image of a fisherman is truly nameless. The words spoken, she thinks secretly, she should not mention the fisherman and the fishing woman.

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talk: "Soaring Ambition"</h3>
<p>"Soaring Ambition" is a grand, unprecedentedly tragic, and passionate film produced by Xinhua Company to adapt to this extraordinary period. It has now been completed and will be jointly screened in major cities across the country starting from New Year's Day. Xinhua authorities once declared that this film would be a stimulant for the Chinese people. Therefore, in the process of production, they did not take shortcuts at all. For example, all war scenes were shot with real guns and ammunition, and the extravagant act of going to Zhengzhou to shoot on location, spending more than 20,000 gold dollars, is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>This film was written and directed by Wu Yonggang. Mr. Wu's works have always been very progressive, and his techniques are very mature. It is foreseeable that this "Soaring Ambition" will give us great satisfaction.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, it has gathered the best talents in the Chinese film industry, such as Jin Yan, Wang Renmei, Chen Juanjuan, Wang Cilong, Han Langen, Li Mingjian, Tian Fang, Zhang Zhizhi, Shi Chao, and Zong You. They are all experienced and admired film personalities, truly a seamless collaboration.</p>

<h3>China Traveling Theatre Troupe Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Performing at the Carlton Theatre soon</p>
<p>The China Traveling Theatre Troupe, the only professional drama group in China, which once caused a sensation in Shanghai and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life, went to various ports in Hunan and Hubei for revolving performances after its performance in Shanghai in September of this year. Wherever they went, people flocked to the streets, and they were extremely popular. The troupe originally planned to travel to Sichuan, but was repeatedly invited by the Carlton Theatre in Shanghai. Therefore, they changed their itinerary and arrived in Shanghai by river steamer from Hankou yesterday. It is said that after a short rest, they will perform for the third time at the theatre, starting on the 23rd of this month. According to the head of the troupe, Mr. Tang Huaiqiu, in addition to the famous dramas performed last time, there are also many new dramas that have been rehearsed and will be presented to the art-loving ladies of Shanghai. It is expected that at that time, the traffic on Parker Road will be heavy, and there will be another grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Opening on "Qingming Season"</h3>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian's "Qingming Season" will be released at the Jincheng Theatre starting on the 23rd. Here is a brief introduction:</p>
<p>The screenwriter of this film is Yao Xinong, who uses a sharp and vivid writing style to depict a lively play of a large family, while giving a group of people struggling on the line of survival an ardent sympathy. The structure of the whole play is strangely interesting. The part where two men on the Yangtze River steamer righteously protect a woman adrift is particularly lovely. It tells us that only among people who are struggling along the same path is there such a thing as "sympathy." In addition, there is only the "utilization" of conspiracy, and only the hypocritical "smile," which cannot be brought together.</p>
<p>Li Minghui plays a poor woman who has fallen into the world, and in the tragic journey of exile, she meets Zhao Dan and his group of people. They all help her and sympathize with her. So she works with them and lives with them. At the same time, Zhao Dan and she fall in love. A pitiful girl who has only been raped and lived a cold life is intoxicated by this emotion. She is performing to a very satisfactory degree. In fact, based on our past impressions of Li Minghui, we can also firmly believe in her achievements.</p>
<p>In addition, Zhao Dan, Li Lilian, Shu Xiuwen, Wu Yin, Wu Yin, etc. do not need individual introductions, they all have extraordinary achievements.</p>
<p>"Qingming Season" is Ouyang Yuqian's second work since "Peach Blossom Debt." In "Qingming Season," he has made even higher and more beautiful creations. What is particularly successful is the depiction of various characters, such as the "crooked neck" old lecherous master and mistress, etc., all of which are particularly vivid, interesting, and true.</p>
<p>This year, "Qingming Season" seems to have become a "year-end blockbuster."</p>

<p>Chen Qixia is indeed a very promising newcomer. Since the release of "By the Huangpu River," in which she starred, she has given the audience a good impression and received a warm welcome from the audience. This has established her position in the film industry.</p>
<p>In addition to the qualities that silent film actors should possess, actors in sound films must also speak fluent Mandarin and have clear enunciation. Although she grew up in the South, she has been learning Mandarin since she was a child. Her vocal cords have also been trained by Peking Opera, so her pronunciation is very loud and clear. In addition, she has a beautiful face and wonderful acting skills. She is indeed an all-around sound film actor.</p>
<p>In "By the Huangpu River," she plays a girl who rows a sampan, lively and innocent, just like a charming little bird. Now, in "Female Students," she plays a spoiled modern lady, whose personality is even more consistent than before. She is more beautiful and lively than in "By the Huangpu River," and her acting skills have also achieved further success.</p>
