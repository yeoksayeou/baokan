<p>日外務省觀點</p>
<h3>中日間　危機暫可避免　雙方對華北意見歧異　川越張羣將賡續談判　各報謂前途困難尙多</h3>
<p>（東京）日本外務省評論八日蔣院長與川越大使之會談、略謂目前雖未許樂觀、但蔣院長既表示充分贊助調整中日關係之基本觀念、故至少目前决裂之危機、可以避免、現有打破繼續談判難關之希望、但中國既注重交相讓步及互惠平等之精神、對於日本之建議、似懷有幾分不滿、且事實上蔣院長對其他問題、雖已準備表示同情、但蔣氏與日本對華北之觀念、顯有歧異之處、日本認華北問題為調整整個關係之先决條件、並將拒絕中國所提之任何對案、外務省批評之結論謂、整個談判獲得合理之解决雖不可能、但一俟基本原則决定、卽行指派共同委員會、談判細目、固非不可能也、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省發言人今日吿新聞記者、謂除已發表之蔣院長與川越大使會談之公報外、渠無何發表、但謂此僅第一次正式會談、川越大使將賡續與張外長舉行談判、如有必要、將再度與蔣院長會晤、並認為目前無論表示樂觀抑或悲觀、均屬過早云、聞川越大使與蔣院長會談之正式報吿、於九日晨二時到達外務省、並未申請特別訓令、外相有田雖攖微疾、今日仍召開外務省首腦會議、東京對各外國駐華使節聚集南京之消息、頗予重視、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（東京）此間各報對蔣委員長與川越大使之會談、尙未有評論、但有一種印象、卽目前僵局雖已展開、但前途困難尙多故外交談判、自極冗長、當地報紙稱川越大使曾於會談中謂、中日兩國人民應共同努力實行「以共同之利益為利益、同時擯除共同之不利益」之指導精神、又謂調整中日關係之工作、不應限於消極的取締排日主義、但應更進而向力謀友好之共同目標邁進云、又傳蔣院長視交相讓步互惠平等為前提、並明白表示與日本眞實改善關係之誠意云、此間一二家報紙　深慮關於共同防共及華北問題、無成立雙方同意　的具體計畫之希望云、川越大使吿駐南京之日本通訊員、謂蔣院長具有消除目前危機調整中日間整個關係之非常的熱忱、此外蔣院長對日本態度、亦有相當瞭解、但對華北問題提出某某數項希望、川越並謂前途雖有障碍、但外交談判並非無望、目前不能謂局勢已趨好轉或更惡化、川越繼謂渠不欲放棄談判之希望、反之渠將繼續竭其全力、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）日本大使川越八日謁蔣院長後、對日記者談、謂或尙須與蔣院長會見二三次、據外交界息、川越再度會見蔣院長日期尙未的定、關於中日具體問題、川越與張外長將作第四次之會談、繼續商討、其日期雖尙未的定、大的當在十三日左右、預料國慶紀念後之一週內、中日調整關係之交涉、將使過去沉鬱之空氣、有流通之希望、（九日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）日大使川越與蔣委員長昨日會談之結果、中日談判得免破裂、惟大局仍未許過分樂觀、此為外務省接到川越大使報吿會談情形後槪括乏意見、外務省各員現正討論川越大使之報吿書、此間許多官員之意見、則以為張羣外長僅應辦理具體之細則、此間各報對於川越昨日與蔣氏會晤之消息、見解不同、惟一致以為談判前途必多困難、故歷時必久、大多數報紙則承認蔣氏似已表示促進滿意解决　之極大熱忱、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）川越大使與蔣委員長昨日會談之內容、日外務省昨深夜接到其報吿、由須磨總領事與中國政府要人預備交涉之經過觀察、中國方面似有誠意與日進行交涉、且蔣介石氏八日會見川越大使之際、對於調整中日國交之根本意義、表示十足同意、故前途如何、雖不許樂觀、然日外務省確信難關已過、交涉已經就其端緒、據聞隨從交涉進行、或設共同委員會、討論詳細事項、亦未可知（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）八日川越蔣第一次會談之內容、九日晨已有詳電到外務省、有田外相本日上午邀首腦部在首相官邸舉行重要協議、由蔣川越第一次會談之經過觀之、似尙無發訓電之必要、川越蔣會談於相當友誼之下進行、關於原則的大綱、中日間意見、業已一致、故外務當局已確信能藉外交折衝之繼續打開中日關係、今後可視必要、與蔣隨時會談、惟討論有以川越蔣會談之原則論為基礎、而入於具體問題之必要、故前月二十三日以來中斷中之川越張羣會談、將於三日中復活、而開始正式的討論、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）中日交涉將於雙十節終了後、大的十二三日再開、中國方面由蔣介石氏裁斷檢討川越　張羣第三次會見之僵局、愼重研究對策、至下次正式交涉時止、似將繼續相當頻繁之預備交涉、如能發見打開之法則、可循此進行正式交涉、日本駐外當局本日仍繼續、開首腦部會議、到川越大使喜多陸軍佐藤海軍兩　武官及須磨總領事等、已决定對策、目下惟待中國方面之出手何如而已、喜多佐藤、兩武官本日乘夜車返滬、（九日同盟電）</p>

<p>（北平）今井談、自豐台中日軍誤會解决後、迄今甚為平靖、外傳種種均不足信、橋本參謀長定九日晚或十日晨來平、係祝賀貴國國座、至於日將在豐台設警署事、不得而知、今井對開發華北經濟、及通航問題、認為均係謠言、（九日中央社電）</p>

<h3>國難嚴重中之雙十節</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>一年一度之雙十節。又於今日悄然其來臨矣。歲月驚心。輒用瞿然。以言國慶。孰不神旺。吾人亦將如華盛頓人士之欣忭鼓舞。以慶合衆國之成立乎。亦將如法蘭西民衆之熱烈歡呼。以點綴民治紀念乎。盱衡今日之時局。默察所處之環境。祇覺有無限悲憤與沉痛。交織於吾人之心頭。吾欲宣。吾不忍宣。而吾又不能不賓。今日外交關係。非已達到最嚴重之階段乎。在「友邦」軍隊武裝威脅之下。在都市人心極度浮動之中。號稱東方巴黎之上海。殆已全為恐怖所籠罩。引領北望。則綏東之警耗頻傳。冀察之形勢日非。匝地陰霾。彌天妖霧。誰實為之。孰令致之。吾人於此。雖欲强顏為歡。亦烏可得。</p>
<p>雖然。雙十節者。固我國近代政治上最光輝之一轉變時期也。回溯二十五年前。革命發動時節。士氣蓬勃。羣情振奮。誠有可以壯山河而立庸懦者。卒於先烈偉大犧牲之下。擺脫異族統治之覊絆。光復黃裔自由之靈魂。同時並推翻數千年來傳統專制政治。而建設共和民主之局面。無論在歷史意義上。在民族立塲上。均有其不可磨滅之精神。以照耀乎後世而長存。處國難嚴重之今日。慶祝可以無心。而紀念之意義。實轉形其重要。誠以先烈悲壯之事實。隨在可為吾輩之鞭策。吾人應從先烈殺身成仁之精神求啟示。而鼓其餘勇。應念先烈輾轉掙得之匪易。而力求湔滌自我塗染之污點。勿及我生有墮甑之憂。勿貽先烈以瓶壘之恥。吾人之所以對先烈者。如是而已。</p>
<p>其决。吾人應知辛亥革命之成功所能如是之速者。其最大因素。還在於民氣之一致。蓋以共時淸室壓迫太甚。民情憤無可洩。乃得於齊一陣綫之下。起而自救。今局勢雖到存亡絕續之秋。而國內統一。幸告完成。此後當不難以其集中之才智。發揮整個之力量。吾人在此非常時期。誠不宜以低徊嗟嘆之情調。自形其消極。亦不應有急遽凌亂之步驟。以涉於張皇。要當秉其堅毅沉著之精神。破釜鑒舟之决心。以負荷先烈付託之重。以示不忘此光明燦爛之雙十節。</p>
<h3>美海軍界　對太平洋設防問題　抨擊英國建議</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）海軍聯歡社對於英國建議維持太平洋防務現狀、今日發表聲明、表示詫異、稱英國建議實不能不認為有欠友誼、吾人未能推知此項建議之動機究係來自外國、抑係純粹英國主張、該會並抨擊日本、謂日本業已悍然破壞保障中國領土完整及門戶開放之各項條的、日本苟能立卽退出中國、永久不加干涉、尊重美國在華權利、遵守代管島防務各項限制、一任美國視察各島、則美國自然願意考慮締結「君子協定」不在太平洋禁止設防區域、建設根據地云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>阜琴尼亞州紐拍紐斯飛機母艦冒險號　今日完成、官方對其速率嚴守秘密、但觀察者估計、該艦每小時至少能駛三十五海里至三十八海里、據最可靠方面估計、該艦載重一萬九千噸、可載飛機七十九架、此艦完成後、美國航空母艦因達六艘之多、其第七艘名華斯普號、一萬四千五百噸、將於一九三八年九月下水、（八日國民電）</p>

<h3>國聯通過報告書　世界經濟轉佳　歐洲金融已恢復信用　德意將加入穩定貨幣</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯經濟委員會報吿書載稱、自一九三一年九月英國放棄金本位以來、吾人對於將來之希望、未有如今日之濃厚者云、上項報吿巳於今日通過、國聯經濟委員會要求各國政府、早日從事談判、俾可將各國整個商業政策加以整頓、目下雖無建議召開新經濟會議者、但關係各國儘有機會公開談判此項問題云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會經濟財政委員會今晨賡續開會、當卽通過下開兩項决議草案、（一）英法兩國代表團會同提出之决議草案、主張國際貿易交通與匯兌之障碍、應卽設法予以减輕、尤其是進口限額制與貨幣統制、亟應予以廢止、（二）英國所提出之决議草案、主張各國對於各項原料品應有平等取給之權、嗣由法國代表、卽該國經濟部長史比那斯報吿委員會、討論結果、略謂、各國調整貨幣之舉、關於緩和人心、恢復繁榮、固有裨益、但「本委員會以為各國出口業所受量的限制、苟不予以廢止、則國際貿易、卽無起色之望、更無從加以發展、茲特要求各國政府、勿以新貨幣法附帶辦法為已足、務宜在最短時期之內、進行談判、俾將現行商業政策、通盤加以修正」云、至是波蘭代表提議將移民問題、列入議程、蘇聯代表當卽出而反對、委員會爰乃接受史比那斯之建議、决定在報吿書內、挿入一段聲明、人口自由流通、實乃貨品與資本自由流通必要之捕充辦法云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財部人員今日宣稱、三國貨幣協定之成立、實由於世界各種貨幣之大規模整理、而不使貿易上發生極小之紛亂、目下英鎊跌至美金四元八角九分、不必引以為異、該發言人又稱、九月二十六日蘇俄在紐的市塲出售一百萬鎊後、美國財部對於匯兌方面、並未企圖以人力干預之、目下匯兌已迅復原狀、各方消息、亦皆表示貨幣有日趨穩定之勢、今日法蘭西銀行貼現率之减低、可見歐洲金融界之信用、已見恢復矣、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）政府中人今日宣稱、英美兩國現正依據英法美三國貨幣協定合作、英鎊與美元匯價在達到穩定比率之前、不免稍有波動、但不致引起兩國貨幣再起决裂、三國貨幣協定施行至今、成績殊堪滿意、世界各國貨幣不久當可調整、以臻適當之平價、國幣貨幣穩定之後、國際貿易卽可隨之自由流通、而不致發生糾紛矣、（八日國民電）</p>

<h3>蘇省惡性瘧疾蔓延　已遍及大江南北　鎭句金丹通如高寳等縣最劇　罹疫人口總數將達百萬左右　省廳及衞生當局已積極防治</h3>
<p>鎭江通訊、蘇省江南北各縣、入秋以來、發生惡性瘧疾、流行甚劇、最近江南方面如鎭江·句容·儀徵·金壇·丹陽·高淳·武進等縣、江北如通·如·高·寳各縣、疫氛極熾、鄉區允甚、每縣罹疫人數、平均在五六萬以上、死亡率亦極可長、估計各該縣受疫人口、總數將達百萬人左右、其他各縣、現亦迷漸發現、省廳方面及衛生當局、正籌謀積極防治、茲將調査所得各情、彙誌如次、</p>
<p>瘧病起因</p>
<p>據醫學專家談、惡性瘧疾之起因、無疑的係由於瘧蚊之傳染、査蚊蚋之滋生、以溫度七十至九十度為最宜、過熱與過塞足以制蚊類之繁殖、今夏氣候多濕、而鮮高熱、甚少達九十度以上之熱度、入秋後則亢旱、雖節過中秋、而溫度猶在七八十度之間、故今歲之蛟虫、較多於往昔、直至深秋、而不减少、於窮鄉僻壤、缺乏衞生之區、惡性瘧疾、由是而起、鄉人每視瘧疾為無關之病症、（俗稱平安病）加以漠視、於是災區逐漸擴大、殊不知此惡性瘧疾、既易於傳染、復足以致人死命也、</p>
<p>疫病症狀</p>
<p>據一般調査所得、發生此項病疫者、始為畏寒戰慄、繼則高熱無汗、或熱後有汗而不多、頭痛腦漲、類似傷寒及腦膜炎、間日輕重、退熱不淸、舌苔白膩、食慾减少、面色黃滯、間有吐瀉、或週身發出斑點、如在四五日內、打瘧疾針服奎靈丸金鷄納霜等、或可無虞、否則危險不治、且極易傳染、倘以病人不隔離、飲食器皿不分淸、往往有一家數口盡罹斯疫者、</p>
<p>蔓延情形</p>
<p>此項病疫、流行甚劇、入秋後、卽有少數發現、至最近止、已呈報到省請求救濟者、有鎭江·句容儀徵·金壇·丹陽·高淳·南通·如臯·等縣、餘如武進·江陰·嘉定·高郵·寳應等縣、疫病亦頗劇烈、江南方面、以句容·鎭江等縣為最劇、句容二區、全區罹疫者、已有五萬餘入、鎭江方面、估計罹疫者有三千餘、鄉區允烈、東碼頭。丹徒新豐一帶、亦死亡相繼、醫生應接不暇、棺材藥品售賣一空、江北以通如疫氛為最烈、如臯一縣、患此疫者、總計共的五萬餘人、死亡已達五千餘人、照保甲調査、一甲之內至少有半數住戶罹此症疫、每保之中、通扯死三十餘人、醫生不敷支配、生意大忙、得病延醫者、醫生按號往診、多須挨二三日方可醫生輪到、故多有得病不獲醫治而死者、棺材賣空、其他如中西藥店及雜貨估衣店、每日至天明、方能收市、交易忙碌貨亦不濟、為從來未見景象、刻正在秋成、疫區棉稻、竟無人收獲、任其荒蕪在田、四鄉已成恐怖世界、</p>
<p>死亡估計</p>
<p>此疫發生之後、大半係在鄉間、且甚少有人注意、罹疫多係鄉農、交通不便、無法就醫、且缺乏衛生常識、以此病為普通疾病、不加注意、且因農村經濟破產、大半無力就醫、故病者無數死亡相繼、平均以罹疫二十人死亡一人、計之其死亡率、當在四五萬人左右、死亡之人類以勞苦貧困者居多、死亡之地域則以鄉村居多、最可慘者、每有一家死亡數口、棺材無人做、尸身無人抬、致無法埋葬者、確實有其事云、</p>
<p>防治一斑</p>
<p>蘇民廳前據各縣呈報到省後、頃已通冷名該縣、速聯合當地衛生機關、及各醫師等、組織防疫隊、購辦治瘧藥品、分往各鄉區治療、幷令一面向民衆宣傳防瘧常識、現鎭江·丹陽·南通·如臯·等防疫隊、均已組織成功、已先後出發治療、全國經委會衛生實騐區撥發蘇省之奎寗丸廿萬粒、民廳昨已派員赴京領取、俟領到後、卽分發各該縣應用、省立醫院方面、亦派員赴滬購辦大批藥品備用、査防治此類病疫、尙不若急性傳染病之棘手、倘醫藥能充分應付、患疫者能積極求治、氣候能轉入正軌、則此項蔓延可怖之惡性瘧、或可於短期內撲滅凈盡云、</p>
<h3>蘇州　火警焚斃四人</h3>
<p>胥門外萬年橋東堍大街、王永順木行對門、馬金福所開之馬福興舊貨店作塲、（與店有一墻之隔）九日晨三時半、忽然失愼、因其中堆積舊衣棉胎、但屬引火之物、故霎時卽行冒穿、無法收拾、時作塲中共有夥友五人、因該屋係靠城墻建築、並無後門、當其火勢猛烈之際、前門已被燒斷、除兩夥友登屋逃出火窟外、尙有三人、卽葬身於烈燄之中、惟逃出之夥友、均受重傷、其一已於上午斃命、尙有一人、現在醫治中、生命亦頗危險、是役全店夥友五人、竟焚斃四人之多、可謂浩刦、至下午三時、僅在火塲中掘獲遺屍一具、尙有兩具、未被發見、所有已逃出而死及掘獲之屍身兩具、業由法院派員蒞騐、其餘二屍、俟掘獲後、再行報騐、聞該店被火損失、至少在六千元以上、但並未保險、</p>

<p>上海營門前有木製高大之「圖騰」、不知者以為係十字架、其實乃採取歐西從前最初民族、為景仰者、圖騰乃西洋文之譯音、上刻有獅猴駱駝之形、獅表示雄健、猴表示活潑、駱駝表高大之意、舊有圖騰獸、曾經蔡元培先生撰詞、上海童軍入營地后、進行營地工程、營門建造異常偉大、係用六座瞭望台分築兩旁、中綴以上海市長所提「上海」二字之橫匾、高可四丈許、從瞭望臺上遠矚各處、置有電話、直通司令營以便傳遞消息、各主要辦公營亦各設電話以便聯絡、除營門外復在四周建便門八座、以利交通、營地道路之建設、其工程更為重大、蓋營地崎嶇、高低不平、經工程隊終日工作、始闢為坦途、其過於低窪、不便開闢者則築旱橋、由營門前後至各團營門、均有平坦大道、門內設有壁報、每日出版一期、營地中央設有　規、係以樹枝石塊築成、利用太陽觀測時候、司令營將於營旁樹立牛皮三面、以便全體童子軍及來賓留名、以留紀念、</p>

<h3>參加世運歐遊雜感　追記中英之戰</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>中華民國二十五年八月六日那一天、是值得我們足球同志紀念着的、因為那是我們中國足球隊破　兒第一遭在世界大會裏頭參加角逐、—是被公認為東方霸主的我們、在歐大陸一回的獻身手、而且是我們在第一週被大必列顛（簡稱英國）淘汰出局的一天、我們以二比零失敗的結果、雖會在電訊中四週傳遍、但詳細的紀載、恐怕除了當時的德文世運報外、他處再也看不見、尤其是戰情之外、關於兩隊的內容、恐怕普天之下、沒有誰比我知道較為詳盡的、從我和英國隊的領隊教練隊長等人的談話中、及事前事後的窮追苦究裏面、我却得着一點資料、是他人所得不着的、我現在　製表出來、供同志們的研究、和球迷們的比較、</p>
<p>英國　中國</p>
<p>隊中人數　廿二　廿二</p>
<p>分隸幾會　八　六</p>
<p>平均年齡　二四　二五</p>
<p>平均重量　一六六　一四八</p>
<p>平均高度　五呎十　五呎八</p>
<p>平均經騐　六年　七年</p>
<p>專事訓練　旬日　賽廿七場</p>
<p>教練　英名宿　無</p>
<p>上半時　〇　〇</p>
<p>終場結果　二　〇</p>
<p>受傷者　〇　〇</p>
<p>假如我對人說、我們這次本有擊敗英國之可能、或簡直說是錯過了戰勝英國的良機的話、恐怕人們一定笑我是誇大狂、是不自量力、是癡人說夢、是過後說那風涼的廢話、真的、如果在比賽之前、我這樣說那就連我自己都要笑我自己狂妄不倫、和不量力度德、但事後的事實告訴我、（英隊也承認的）我們根據那天的戰情而論、確有打得勝鼓回營的可能、現在追述起來、讓我遠遠地從頭說起、</p>
<p>七月九日、我們在印度的孟買城結束了南洋一帶的戰事、萘胺祖國駛來的選手團道經斯地、我們便登州會合歸隊、向歐洲進發了、我們這次六十餘日的南洋遊踪、造成二十七戰未嘗一敗的優異記錄、增加了我們赴歐行程中不少的勇氣、在舟間我們得着消息、說第一週錦標賽是拈着何英國對壘、我們像冷水淋頭般頹喪失望、半信半疑地幻想着、我們未來的慘敗、誰不知足球是發源在英國的、誰不知道我國的足球、直接間接都是從居留中國的英人方面學來的、以後學的身份、去和那先進老師對抗、不　是以卵擊石、誰也知道得勝的希望、是微乎又微的、或且簡直是完全絕望的、我們隊中那時的心理、是祗有從努力掙扎中、把自己的本領、盡量拿出來、給外人們看看、同時希冀作一個良好的失敗者、希冀能於奮　之下、不致被人殺至落花流水、全無招架之力而已、在舟中那十幾天、我們為着南洋戰事的辛勞、所以全程養息、未嘗訓練過一次、這輪次的休養、是得着主幹事沈嗣良君和總教練馬約翰君的同情和特許的、</p>
<p>七月二十三日·我們安抵大會所在地柏林了、我們第一週撞着英國的消息、也從秩序表中證實了、我們那時一方面從安定生活中、從事訓練、一方面望眼欲穿地盼望着英國隊的蒞臨、好調查他們的實力、來作九死一生中的準備、我們寄居在離城市三十公里的　令配克時、那裏是男選手的總匯區域、女界不許入內的、地方佈置得很美備、風景也很幽緻、食宿也豐美酣適、在裏面住過的人、沒一個不表示滿意和有設備週全的感覺、我們的訓練、是每朝五時半起床、六時到村內的運動場內集合、先行柔軟體操、種種輕微動作、然後跑圈子練長氣、每兩三天總有一次的下午、是到外面的球場去練球的、有時練習射門、有時分隊比賽、研究一攻一守的陣法、我們事前的苦心奮練、是表示我們雖則有點怨恨造化之不良、給我們和英國排在一起、但我們絕對沒有灰心、因為我們深知、如果我們用過苦功努力去週旋、而仍然失敗、而且敗於足球先進的英國、我相信是沒有人會　責的、我們的心理是“Nothing　to　lose　everything　to　gain”「不會吃大虧、祗有便宜佔、」我們是預備着失敗去和人家奮　、下了仍要苦戰的大決心、</p>
<p>有一天一位素昧平生的僑胞某君、寄給我左列的一封信、</p>
<p>「惠堂隊長台鑒、敬啟者、此次世運足球錦標、我國第一週即遇英倫、人皆認為絕望、然以余年來居留歐洲之閱歷而言、則英之業餘實力、殊不足以驚人、是故本屆強旅、乃在德·意·奧大利·波瀾諸國、而不在英也、願好自為之、努力將英倫淘汰、則全球耳目、必為之一新耳、順祝勝利、弟某某謹啟、」（未完）</p>

<h3>如何珍惜此存亡轉捩之時機</h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>今日何日？我中華民國建國二十有五周年之紀念日也！此時何時？亦我民族存亡危急之秋也！處此存亡、危急之秋，以紀念我先烈建國之勛績，誠有所謂良辰常於前，而百感動於中者矣！</p>
<p>近年以來國人自私心理之警覺，及多年所期望之統一局面之實現，既足以確證復興民族之潛力，故雖當危急存亡之秋？而羣策羣力，穩渡難關，前途殊有望也！國人乎！其思有以拯我邦國，以報我先烈者乎！則其速躍然奮起，以珍惜此時機，而把牢母失！</p>
<p>然則珍惜之道果何若？曰莫浪費。——莫浪費一文之金錢，莫浪費一分之精力，莫浪費一秒之時間。</p>
<p>不浪費一文之金錢，則公帑悉用之於建設，而貪汚盡行剗除，私人經濟，僅耗於生活必需之資，而烟賭等害，不禁而自絕。不浪費一分之精力，則猜忌傾札，反動陰謀，憬然自覺而蕩然無存，人人集中精力，唯公共福利之是圖。不浪費一秒之時間，則頹廢浪漫，因循依賴，罷工曠課，尸位素餐等諸惡習，均得廓而淸之，而羣趨於戰兢惕勵埋頭苦幹，以自力求更生之途。以充實國防安定民生為當前之急務，以解除國難復興民族為一致之標的，有利於此，羣起圖之，無利於此，雖毫厘之微，未敢虛擲。</p>
<p>然則更將操何術以臻此境地？曰當速普遍新生活運動—必如此而後可以振奮國民之精神，恢復民族之自信，必如此而後可以養成不浪費金錢，精力，時間之習慣。曰當極力推行國民經濟建設運動，—此乃充實國防安定民生之要策，亦卽拯救國難復興民族之捷徑；蓋一方既須消極的不浪費金錢精力與時問，一方更應積極的集中此全民族之金錢精力與時間，納而歸之於此唯一之正軌，步伐整齊，同流並進，誠能如此，而持之不懈，則我四萬萬五千萬之龐大民族，何事不可為！</p>
<p>頃者，大局和平，海內統一，危虞之關頭，已有轉捩之傾向，則於此無上寳貴之時機，宜如何珍惜利用，母稍浪費，咬緊牙齦奮邁前進。於今歲此時，或猶有媿乎稱慶，而懸此鵠的，不逮不已，精誠所至，金石為開，我國人敢自信於此先烈浩氣凌霄光復神州之一日，終必有舉國同慶歡欣鼓舞之一年！國人乎！其振奮，母自餒；其猛進，母蹉跎。</p>

<p>（一）捕房所提出之物證</p>
<p>（一）手槍及其中原留子彈六粒捕房呈案手槍一枝、及其中原留子彈六粒、據稱該槍係日副捕頭在豐樂里看弄人木亭下找得、其時為十一時四十分、（見該日副捕頭之供詞）距中山秀雄被殺之時、已有一小時三十餘分之久、其地離出事地點、有五百零九尺之遠、（為西副探長克勞德所報告）是謂該手槍確係殺死中山秀雄之槍、先已牽强、再査該槍、據稱係在木亭底下尋得、西探於葉海生表演之時、且用手杖撥出、工部局律師並稱、『因為在當夜日捕頭趕到這出事地點、逆料還有手槍、於是用電燈各處照看、照到木亭子底下、果然發現有桿手槍、常然也是用木棍仲進去撥出來的、』等語、（均見葉海生表演履勘筆錄）央兇手事畢逃逸、將惟恐人發覺、檢為護身之器、隨身携去、實屬有利無害、若謂其不憚有聲、將槍擲地、已不近情、今乃謂兇手於逃命之時、竟肯中途停留、從容俯身置槍於木亭之下、其誰信之、且據該日副捕頭供稱、『十一時四十分、據日探海里牙磨報吿、有一日兵打死、卽時趕到、』『十一點四十分時、我尋得一枝手槍等語、（見五月一日筆錄）是得悉出事之後、卽時在該亭下尋得、目據上開履勘筆錄所載、係用手電燈俯照亭底、用木棍撥出而得、再査捕房前於調查中山秀雄被害案時、曾就調查結果、下一斷語云、『該用於本案謀殺之槍、』係於豐樂里內李鴻賓之木房後尋得、有人欲陷李鴻賓於罪、故將槍置彼處、等語、（見捕房呈案第十一次紀錄）是捕房所見、原與各被吿辯護人之所見略同、矧査西副探長於五月二十七日、因解釋子彈、並非在水兵之前、而係在其後面檢得之故、（詳後）會稱常時各方因公到塲者、有一二百人之多、捕房律師於七月十日、為解釋同一問題起見、又詳稱當時各方因公到塲者已有一二百人、再加觀衆、不下三四百人、半里以內、均為些三四百人所佔』等語、此項主張、如確係當時情形、則該手槍尙憑何理由、可保其非出於栽拋、其在本案、尙有何證據力之可言、</p>

<p>（甲）査該第六一號日捕明供、「在血漬南面有八尺遠近、我找得一顆子彈、」而中山秀雄係在寳樂安路由南向北回營、（査五月一日筆錄、西副探長克勞德關於該水兵行踪之陳述、）槍彈係由後腦入、前腦出、該水兵所受僅此一彈、（均見日本軍醫小川恂吉之診斷書、及五月六日之陳述、）故該子彈倘果係擊斃該水兵之彈、應落於該水兵之前向、不應在其後八尺遠近找得、是該子彈無論找得是否屬實、先已不能調係擊斃水兵之彈、此點經辯護人當庭提出後、捕房律師始尙稱確在屍身前面找得、繼經辯護人在捕房呈案繪圖指出各地點後、乃委由西副探長克勞德供答、克勞德始則辯稱、係由後而斜入、然縱使斜入、午彈仍應落於前方偏斜、且就軍醫小川恂吉之診斷書、及死者頭部照片而觀、所偏甚微、故該軍醫經當庭詢以「是後腦進去、前腦穿出的、是不是呢、」答稱「是的」、「後腦有一個洞口、前面腦門也有一個洞口、」是上開解釋、顯難成立、該西副探長繼稱、「死者身長有五尺八寸高、當時突受槍傷、也許能冉上前兩步、方始倒地、」然謂彈穿腦部之人、能步行超出落彈八步之前、亦非有理、該西副探長繼又稱嗣後各方因公到、塲之人有一二百人之多、子彈恐係踢去云云、然查該找得子彈之第六一號日捕明供、「在十一月九日下午九點鐘出事之後、我趕到當地、看見有一灘血漬、在血漬南面、有八尺遠近、我找得一顆子彈、等語、是明係供稱九時出事」卽趕到找得、而該日捕係在首先到塲之列、本為捕房方面所明供、當時並無人多雜亂之情形、且卽假定當時確有如此情形、而捕房之解釋、亦不過謂該子彈有被踢移之可能、殊不知捕房應證明者、為該子彈確係擊斃水兵之彈、乃今卽就其所稱、亦至多有此可能、距證明之程度尙屬甚遠、况査找得子彈時、苟眞有一二百入之多、且據捕房律師所述、當時連觀衆、共有三四百人、而子彈又係在不應落下之處找得、則尙憑何理由、可保其非出於栽拋、共在本案、又尙有何證據力之可言、乃原審竟採該西副探長所為、因到塲人多、恐被踢至南面之臆測、為認定事實之基礎、至又以圖載拾得子彈之處、與拾得彈壳之處、成一平綫、為證明該臆測近情合理之論據、則其理何在、允為不明、子彈既係任人踢移、則其對於彈壳之方向、無論何種關係、自均可以發生成為平綫或又綫、究竟有何區別、又子彈與彈壳兩點之間、無論如何關係、均可成一直綫、今所謂是一平綫云云、不知究指對於其他何一第三點而言、</p>
<p>（乙）該子彈經檢騐後、並無血痕發現、是該子彈先已不能調係殺人之彈、雖法醫硏究所閱時、亦認為在近距離射擊中穿透動物之槍彈、可以不留血痕、然不留血痕、亦僅例外有此可能而已、原則上、仍應留有血痕、故不留血痕之事實、仍應發生彈非殺人之推定、捕房為反對之主張、應負進而舉證之責、</p>
<p>（丙）大小相同之槍、其子彈亦多相同、專家就槍與子彈之本身檢騐、亦僅能斷定該子彈可由該槍發出、至是否確係由共發出、自尙須有其他事實證明、原審採納西探目卡雷一語、空言認定該子彈卽係由該槍發出、亦非有據、故此點亦尙有待於證明、今捕房就此、既尙並無證據、則卽假定該子彈係殺人之彈、亦仍不能牽涉該槍、更不能由該槍而牽涉挖有槍形之書</p>
<p>（三）挖有槍形之書　捕房呈案挖有槍形之實用物理學一册、據稱、係第一六四號日捕在楊文道室內我出、然此書並非楊文道所有、實係誣攀之人、為圖得賞金之故、串同製造栽拋而來、關於此書、應陳之點甚多、茲分述之、</p>
<p>（甲）據楊文道供、於民國二十二年向李暮處取來手槍一枝、因恐為兒童玩弄、故其堂姪楊建忠、敎其以取書挖洞藏置之簡便方法、當卽照製、嗣後槍已交還、書歸無用、亦卽棄置、聽由孩童玩弄、至捕房呈案一書、實為楊建忠之所栽拋、査證人張深供、與曾元自幼同學、去冬往訪、見有郭偉民（又名平山元一、已入日籍、據西副探長於五月二十日報吿、逮捕楊文道、係由其吿發）與曾並榻抽烟、用鉛筆於紙上繪一手槍、曾元嗣後邀其同往鄭處取錢、鄭初不在家、不久卽返、由曾介紹相識、翌日鄭來稱、如能投日軍司令部報稱中山秀雄係被葉海生楊文道與韓人傑克槍殺、可得四千元之賞格等情、原審以此證言、詢之曾元、（係捕房證人、時正在庭）曾稱滿對滿對、（均見五月六日筆錄）張琛並呈曾元親筆所書岡幅廣東小學女敎員陳鴻璧之文件一紙、曾元當庭經詢問後、承認係彼親筆所書、（見六月十六日筆錄）是張琛致鄭偉民會元等串誣情形、實言之歷歴如繪、再查楊建忠久已逃避無踪、於本案重開辯論後、忽於八月間自投捕房、於八月十九日開庭時、由捕房將其帶案、經訊問後、當庭明認楊文道為共極遠之叔輩、與鄭偉民相識有六七年、（捕房紀錄對楊鄭相識、已有十年、）今年四月二日及四月十六日均見過、會將楊文道之住址交鄭、且同往晤楊桂梅、並曾向鄭借錢、於本案起訴後、五月間南赴廣州、嗣並輾轉南京·杭州·鎭江之間、（均見捕房記錄及原審八月十九日筆錄）在原審並稱、「後來我因為對於我的空氣很不好、有人揚言要打死我、我因為性命要緊、所以才走的、」楊建忠苟非虛心、佝至四處逃避、苟無串誣栽害之事、更何至再欲打死之空氣、再査張琛亦供某日曾千元之妻、囑同往鄭偉民家素欵、見楊建忠坐在客堂內、（見六月三日筆錄）綜上開各項供詞而觀、該呈案之書、係由鄭曾諸人串造、由楊建忠栽拋之主張、並非無據、至書內殘留之指印、並無與楊建忠之指紋及掌紋相似之紋路、則杳楊建忠一人就楊文道所稱、本僅止於栽拋、栽拋條須手携書面、母庸撳手書頁、而該書內發見之情形、均在書內頁上、並不在書面之上、故書頁上無與相似之紋路、本屬當然、原審因此認為栽拋之說不實、顯非有理、至原審又稱、楊建忠並不承認栽贓、則本無望其自認犯罪之理、原審不就上開各項供詞、及後列各點注意、而僅據此牽斷、允屬不常、</p>
<p>（乙）法醫硏究所經原審法院之囑托、將楊文道之指紋及掌紋、與該書內發見之各指紋相核對、反覆檢査、並未見有相似之處、且書內留有血指痕、明係用刀鑿洞時所致、亦與楊文道指掌之紋路不符、（均見該所各騐査書）該書苟係楊文道所有、焉能有此結果、此實足為書係栽拋之確證、乃原審竟將如此要證、置之不問、其認定事實之錯誤可知、</p>
<p>（丙）呈案一書、雖形似汚舊、然法醫研究所檢査說明書、明載「其放置處所」空氣之溫度、及手槍表面、有無油臘附着、均能影響其氣化發生之遲速、又「手槍保險機對方之紙面上、有破孔二枚、其邊翻捲有銹斑及油跡、」是該書面係以油臘致銹、該說明書又載「書內深痕及破孔、非藉外界壓力不易形成、」是明係臨時壓成無疑、該檢查說明書、有足以證明該書係臨時造成之、如此重要鑑定、而原審竟無一言論及、宜其判决之失當至此、</p>
<p>（丁（呈案一書、雖所挖之洞、表面上汚舊不整、而洞內切痕不僅整齊、且尙嶄新、其在書之左下方兩灣轉處、及左上方靠左之短邊允甚、苟非臨時製造、决不能有此現象、雖法醫硏究所檢査說明書、謂切痕之新舊、殊難測定、然其所以不能測定之原因、明言係因「在一般紙張切痕、每可因色澤濃淡、或可判斷其新舊、但本决所檢之槍形切痕、係位於書中不易與外界光棧塵埃接觸、」是法醫研究所、係僅對原審所詢之一問題、就洞之本身觀察、予以答復、本案尙有其他有關係之事實、並未一併交與硏究、此事實惟何、卽在本案捕房主張、該書係由楊文道作為藏槍之用、該書倘確曾經作為此用、且其使用已歷時如此久長、足使洞面各頁之汚舊、及壓痕之深、至如上述之甚、是否洞內切痕、尙能如此整齊嶄新、此實人人知為决不可能、然此點並未經原審交付該所鑑定、該所自可無須贅及、且既係常識間題、本亦毌　鏗定、乃原審雖經辯護人於書狀及當庭一再陳明、並未予以注意、亦屬疏忽、</p>
<p>（戊）原審雖稱楊文道曾於四月二十日、當庭承認該書、嗣於四月二十七日、始稱該書並非所有、以前另有一本、然查四月二十日、僅係捕房聲請覊押、並非本案審理、故原審詢問楊文道時、僅就案桌持書相詢、並未交閱、相距甚遠、不易明辨、且楊文道本有一書、雖一係英文、一係中文、而形色相似、（呈案一書、係商務印書館出版、與英文原本及翻本書籍形色類似）、而挖洞藏槍之書、並非常見之物初不料有此巧合、故一經詢問、不加細視、卽行承認、適足見其坦白無慮之情、至四月二十日庭詢時、書未交閱一層、則査五月九日筆錄第二九頁載、原審經楊文道稱、「太遠了、我看不淸楚」、詢以「頂多也不過現在這樣遠、何以會看不淸楚呢」、是</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>可知第一次詢問時、確係僅就案桌舉示、並未交閱、至克勞德報告楊對其稱、該書係其所有、則早經楊供、當時克勞德僅手持該書一揚、何能知共與自己原有之書不同、其情亦正與當庭承認相同、原審就此未予注意、其錯誤亦與上同、</p>
<p>（己）呈案一書、是否確係藏置呈案手槍之書、尙有待於證明、蓋同牌等大之槍、其構造完全相同、故為一槍所挖之洞、與他槍皆可配合、各槍所留壓痕、亦均必相同、原審據工部局指印間職員之報吿、認定該書向係用以藏置呈案之手槍、實非允當、至又引法醫硏究所之鑑定、則純屬誤會、査原審去函所詢之問題、為「收藏手槍書內之銹跡、如藏置同牌等大之手槍、是否亦復相等」、易詞言之、卽書因藏置甲槍而生銹、其銹跡是否能與另一同牌等大手槍之銹相等、此人人可知、當然不能相等、故法醫硏究所之答復亦然、原審去函又進而詢問、「究竟該書內所有銹痕、如遇有同牌等大之手槍生銹、藏置書內、是否絕對不能相同」、該所答復、為「偶然相似之處、不能無之、但其銹斑之部位及形態、殊難一一相符」、此亦當然之理、然本案書內之銹、與呈案手槍之銹、是否一一相符、原審並未詢及、該所自可不論、乃原審竟認此為上述工部局指印間職員報吿之覆騐、且據以認定該書確係藏置呈案手槍之書、謂非誤會而何、總之、呈案之書、須與呈案手槍有關、始有硏究上開各節之必要、而究竟有無關係、原審並未取得、足為原判决基礎證據、</p>
<p>（庚）楊文道之使役、卽前被捕而起訴之陳榮注、經反覆盤詰、均供在楊家未見呈案之書、楊書係英文的云云、</p>
<p>（辛）綜上開各點、可知該書實非楊文道所有、卽辯護人尙有進而從理論上申問之一點、卽假定該書確係楊文道所有、並在其家中搜得該槍、確係藏置該書之槍、該子彈確係由該槍發出、擊斃中山秀雄之彈、是否卽可據以認定中山秀雄、確係楊文道所殺害、須知在楊文道家中搜得者、並非該槍、而僅係藏槍之書、並非兇器、而僅係藏兇器之具、（假定該槍為兇器）至多亦僅能由此推定該兇器、初曾在楊之占有中、亦猶有屍倒地、在其旁發兒一刀、該刀査係某甲所有、是否卽可據此事實、認定甲為殺人之犯、</p>
<p>（二）葉海生之自白</p>
<p>（一）自白並非出於自由原審又據葉海生之自白、為判决之基礎、然查葉之自白、其離奇變幻、實為空前、查方其於捕房聲請覊押時、當庭明稱與中山秀雄被害事無關、且連竇樂安路亦從未到過、嗣後捕房起訴、原請以楊文道開槍葉海生帮助分別論罪、（五月一日筆錄載捕房律師稱、「現在經捕房査明、當時是第一被吿楊文道開的槍、第二被吿葉海生在塲帮助」）葉海生當時亦卽照認與楊同去、楊開槍後、自己卽逃回、乃第二次開庭時、捕房提出葉海生於第一次開庭以後、在捕房被詢之供單、方據以詳述出事以前如何經過之情形、而不圖葉海生自測難免寃獄、不願更牽他人、乃忽挺身自認殺害水兵、純係其一人所為、書內之洞、亦係其自己所挖、證人胡祥和方供出事之後、未見有此、而被吿中之任何一人、乃葉海生反稱「他沒有看見我、我倒看見了他」、同時並稱、「因為怕吃苦頭、信口亂說的」、「前兩决是因為捕房裏捕頭對我說、不供也要我供、供了可以减輕、於是我一時腦筋糊塗、咬他」、（均見五月六日筆錄、然經此一變後、原吿以前主張之事實、及所提證據、均與葉海生之自白格不相入、當庭原吿罄請延展兩星期、嗣於五月九日聲請曁押、周社榮事件開庭時、又提出葉海生之新單、主張楊葉等事前預謀、當晚同去、臨時由葉開槍、葉於當庭亦卽照認、嗣於本案五月一十日第三次開庭時、除照認外、並為詳細之供答、旋且於九月二十二日實地表演、然査五月二十日筆錄載、「葉海生哭」、經詢以「既是你一個人幹的、好漢做事、好漢當、你為什麽哭呢」、「不答」、五月二十二日履勘筆錄、亦載「問你從前不是說、退後往南跑的麼」、「答案子是往南跑、所以我說南跑、（後低聲喊寃枉哪）、」又載葉海生稱、「呵、回到月宮去的、（後低聲喊審判長救命喲）」、「問為什麽」、「囁嚅不答」、至五月二十七日第四次開庭時、乃始一面痛哭、一面否認與殺害水兵事有關、並稱在捕房受刑等情、旋經原審派法醫檢騐、據騐單所開、肋部似係軟物摩擦、騐係在第六七八肋骨部位等情、核與葉海生供由鼻液水、用拳摩擦肋骨、藉使水下等說相合、騐單又開鼻孔下上唇皮現一疤痕、一公分長、半公分寬、長圓形性軟甚整齊等語、核與葉海生稱、用香烟塞鼻燃燒云云相符、卽工部局醫院副督察長莊士敦證明書、亦稱該疤可因燒灼而致云云、再觀其粗細及上下整齊各點、益知决非手抓齒嚙可致、再査騐單又開尙未出二三星期云云、亦與葉海生所稱五月六日開庭後、（卽大變初次自白後（所受之說、多無不合、（以上葉海生供詞、均見五月二十七日及六月三日筆錄）、是葉海生之自白、並非出於自由、實屬無可諱言、</p>
<p>（二）表演並非出於自由　葉海生於五月二十二日所為實地表演、係緊接其五月二十日當庭所為陳述而來、况前已早往捕房導往舉行兩次、（見五月二十日筆錄所載克勞德報吿）當地各情、久已記憶、且當塲自始至終、係由日捕兩人夾挾而行、兩手加銬、此外並有其他日捕擁隨葉之行止、實係人行卽行、人止卽止、其名雖為表演、其實不啻導演、</p>
<p>（三）自白表演均與事實不符甲·法醫硏究所文字第四三號檢査說明書稱、就子彈在被害人頭部經過跡徑之角度推算、開槍距離尙可在五十公分之遠近、若就傷口火藥烟暈而論、則僅得有”公分左右，核諸葉海生所表演在五六步之距離開槍、相差實有數十倍之多、在如此距離、非臥地開槍、不能得該年度、是表演最重要之一點、卽與事實不符、</p>
<p>乙·捕房證人潘巧英供、當時見一日本水兵、與另一人、分東西向北前行、（見七月二十八日筆錄）前在捕房亦稱、「平行而向同一方向行走」、（見第三次記錄）核與葉稱在數步後尾隨之說不符、</p>
<p>丙·葉海生表演、由豐樂里兩豎木中間逃過、與胡祥和所演繞由電桿旁逃出之情形不合、（見履勘筆錄）</p>
<p>丁·胡祥和供、「逃的人衣服似乎是水兵樣的」、（見五月六日筆錄）又供、「身體高度不及葉海生、腰身比較葉來得寬點」各等語、（見履勘筆錄）亦與葉海生所着衣褲形式及其身長而細各情不符、戊·葉海生在豐樂里表演逃出時稱、逕逃至虬江路家中、亦與其前供回到月宮飯店不符、</p>
<p>己·此外如入豐樂里內小弄繞轉、不逕逃往北四川路、而仍回至豐樂里各情、按諸當地形勢、亦均不可信、</p>
<p>庚·葉海生稱、曾在同義會商議、且有傑克等兩韓人在塲、然該屋房東朱森甫、及該會茶房紀阿根、則均稱未曾見過葉海生、且亦無韓人到彼云云、</p>
<p>（四）依刑事訴訟法第二七〇條第一項之規定、被告之自白、須非出於强暴脅迫利誘詐欺、或其他不正之方法、且與事實相符者、始得為證據、葉海生之自白、不能　為判决犯罪之基礎、自甚顯然、乃原審就强暴脅迫一層、則竟認為自白、並非出於刑求、就與事實是否相符一層、則舉出自白中尾隨水兵之重要一點、說明其與各證人及鑑定與診斷畫、有不符後、反以葉之所稱不足採信、一言了之、而原審之所據以認定自白與事實相符者、乃胡祥和與潘巧英、均供當　見有一穿黑色服裝之人、而捕房曾在靑島搜得葉所有之黑色西裝一套、査寒天而着之衣、多係深色、而西裝與兵服允然、街頭燈下見之、概可稱為黑色、有何足異、目原審據此瑣屑之點、認定殺人之自白屬實、適足以見其理由之薄弱、至又據淞滬警備司令部案卷稱、葉海生素有斧頭黨之稱、則査閱該案卷宗葉海生、早因並無嫌疑被釋、且此亦與自白之是否相符、根本無關、</p>
<p>（三）殺人之動機</p>
<p>捕房主張楊葉等犯殺人之罪、實毫無動機可指、雖經原審一再論以此點後、嗣卽提出葉之供單、　葉在捕房承認、希圖惹起騷動、乘機在虹口擴充勢力、然楊葉究竟有何勢力、欲求擴充、虹口如有騷動、究竟如何可以擴充勢力、且以殺人為擴充勢力之方法、其愚為不可及、而其粗勇亦絕非楊葉其人所能有、原審竟予置信、實欠斟酌、</p>
<p>（四）被告之反證</p>
<p>本案有關係之證人無罪、先經捕房訊問、再行到案、且幾無不具一供單到庭、一一照認、在刑庭審理之中、檢察偵訊、幾於自始至終、並行而進、且均超前為之、其偵訊範圍、且不限於滬上、曾有遠至靑島者、終故證人或則不敢叶實、或則避而他去、故被吿雖曾有證人可舉、亦均非不吐實卽行遠避、欲提反證、其難可知、然　有數點、足為有利於被告之事實、卽（一）葉海生稱、南洋舞廳開幕之日、當晚在彼曾有打架之事、而該廳稽査姚松亭稱、該廳係於十一月八日開幕、（見六月十六日筆錄）且與捕房證人張財源同稱、該晚曾有毆打事、且數分鐘後、見葉站於舞塲之外、（見捕房第二十七次記錄）（二）葉海生於十一月十日、在大中華為母祝壽、其酒席且係張財源預為代定、亦為張財源所明認、（見六月十六日筆錄）是水兵被害之前一日與後一日、葉均從容為他事所覊、焉有中間忽行殺人之理再（三）葉於晚間常在月宮、不難證明、故其不自由之自白、遂承認殺人之事前、係由月宮出發、事後亦卽逃回月宮、騰出中間瞬息之時、為抽身出外殺人之用、一若殺人不過為一種與出外散步相同之事也者、其結果乃使此項反證、失其效用、（四）葉海生曾接張財源電話、謂捕房欲拘其人、應卽速逃云云、葉卽舉以吿宓保生、經宓保生於六月十六日供明在案、以上各端、皆是反證、被告當日必無殺人之事、</p>
<p>（五）就本案證據所可推得之事實眞相</p>
<p>本案就原審調査之結果、不但可知中山秀雄之死、與葉海生等完全無涉、且可推得其開槍殺害該水兵者、究係何種之人、査法醫硏究所就最準確之火藥烟暈標準、斷定手槍發射時、與被害人頭部之距離、僅的五公分左右、五公分之距離、已貼近頭部、倘兇手係尾　被害人前行者、斷無追蹤至與被害人相觸時，始行開槍之理、該兇手顯係與被害人相並前行、乘機猝然開槍、（潘巧英並有兩人平行之供、見前、）再觀西副探長克勞德詳述被害人、在被害日之行踪、自上午起至晚八時四十分止、除四時至六時四十分在兵營、六時四十分至八時行蹤未能確悉外、無時不在類似妓院之處、前後共至四處之多、該西副探長並稱、「當時西河海兒曾　他住夜、他不肯、」（均見五月二日筆錄）可知被害人實係風流之輩、其遇當又卽在上沐留宿未允之後、步行回返、途近兵營之處、其為爭風嫉害而死、殊可想見、</p>
<p>綜上各節、可知中山秀雄之死、與葉海生並無關係、本案之起、實係有人圖得賞金、串同誣陷所致、為特縷瀝上陳、伏乞鈞院俯念殺人大惡、論死極刑、詳賜審理、依法判决、撤銷原判、關於葉海生之部分、諭知無罪、以雪寃獄、實為公德兩便、謹狀江蘇高等法院第二分院、</p>

<h3>海寗路日水兵被殺案　嫌疑犯昨審訊　中日證人認定兇手着西裝　張榮和拾槍圖賞致被拘禁　法官將定期至出事處履勘</h3>
<p>上月二十三日晚、海寗路吳淞路十五弄附近發生日水兵田港朝光被人槍殺、同時尙有日水兵八幡良胤·出利葉藏已、亦受槍傷一案、經日海軍陸戰隊嗣卽弋獲粥販張榮和·及馬永才·馬永年·三名、經虹口捕房提解特一院、除兩馬因無嫌疑、已予開釋外、張榮和則涉嫌稍重、仍予覊押各情、已誌本報、此案昨日午後二時、由特一法院鍾淸推事偕宋根山檢察官·王蘭屛書記官·升座刑一庭、</p>
<p>繼續提訊</p>
<p>捕房代表律師為汝葆彝·張師竹日軍司令部則由陸戰隊士兵十餘名到庭、先由捕房張律師起稱、被吿張榮和、現已在捕房供認是日聞槍聲後、卽前往出事地點、由西向東、離十五弄的七尺處、卽踢倒一物、檢視之、則為手槍一支、當時卽以之置入沙箱、卽遭逮捕、據其稱所以將槍藏入箱中、實擬於事後向捕報吿、而希圖得到相當之賞金、故捕房現依照刑法一六五條之湮滅蹬據罪起訴、並稱本案</p>
<p>證人檢多</p>
<p>內有十一人並未目覩出事情形、而在捕房已書有供單者、可免予訊問、而今日所欲提出之證人日人星田義雄·山中當茂·若林久晃·田邊治郞·吉田定雄·及華人張良竇·等、均目覩出事之情形者、其餘尙有多名、均無關緊要、當隨時再訊、至田港·八幡·出利·三人之死傷騐單、均已由日軍醫官吉田長武·小川開具騐單及攝有照片、而出事地點之情形、亦各攝有照片、在出事處之牆上</p>
<p>留有彈痕</p>
<p>如庭上應有履勘之必要、請訂一日期前往査勘、至沙箱內檢獲之手槍上、雖留有手印、然因經過多入執過、故亦難以査檢、而在徐慶坊拾獲之槍、則騐得與本案無關、故不予提出、出事處檢獲之彈壳九枚、子彈一顆、經捕房專家騐得確從沙箱內所獲之槍放出、立有鑑定書、遂將各項文件一併呈案、請察、繼由星田義雄證稱、是日我因事出後一衣深黃西裝者的五尺四五寸高之人、初在我後、繼乃超過至我前而來、未幾卽聞</p>
<p>槍聲三響</p>
<p>後該人卽自北海寗路向左轉灣、至一日本敎堂前雇坐黃包車向北四川路而去、後乃不見云云、而山中當茂未到、遂由華人張良竇蹬稱、在北海寗路四十八號一朝鮮人家為西崽、是晚在出事處見有一穿黃色一穿灰色西裝者二人、初在四日水兵之前行走、後至上海銀行附近一電桿木旁立定、四水兵遂超過二人之前、卽見黃衣者出槍開放二槍後、我卽從十五弄逃回東家處報吿住於樓上之六十五號</p>
<p>特別巡捕</p>
<p>麥高倫、麥卽取槍出追、以後卽不知悉云云、若林久晃則證明見一西裝者開槍後逃入十五弄、惟稱該人係衣綠色西裝、致與以上二證人所述不同、庭上乃令該三證人就庭上旁聽者所衣之服裝顏色予以認定、以為將來之參考、經各指定後、又據田邊治郞證明兇手為二人、一衣灰色西裝、一衣黑色短服、而吉田定雄亦證明一西裝開槍後逃入十五弄、該二人均認定行兇者為華人、庭上卽詢以東方人士皮色相同、且衣西裝何能鑑別其確屬華人、該二人則稱彼等對華人自有</p>
<p>鑑別能力</p>
<p>云云、庭上遂向張榮和質訊、據供、當我聞槍聲後、至出事處在路踢得一手槍、當時心中慌張異常、若欲卽持以報捕、恐被疑為兇犯、乃藏諸沙箱、以備以後報吿巡捕、詎甫藏入、卽為日人所逮捕、初稱擬得賞金、後則稱並無希圖得賞之念、庭上卽將捕房呈案之槍給閱是否為當時所拾藏之槍張答</p>
<p>大致相似</p>
<p>庭上以張前供聞槍聲後疑及擺設乾飯攤之同鄉人俞長太被人所害、故往探視、乃傳俞長太至案、據供我在距沙箱的四五尺處擺設乾飯攤、出事時、適去泡開水、故完全不知、復由其妻李氏投證當時並未注意、及張榮和來詢我何事、我答以不知、後卽見張被捕、是時曾有一人撞於我身、亦未注視云云、鍾推事核供、乃諭本案改期二十三日下午再訊、並另定日期至出事處履勘、</p>

<p>時代醫藥刊夫婦智識  美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著兩性相親的性的急迫！　　……性生活是夫婦和好的基礎性能不全就是病態愛不永長　……幼年時代的手淫過度及婚後的縱欲均非合理的性生活　……早洩與陰萎實為擾亂美滿家庭的惡魔不可不早期治療　　在社會上，常見夫婦感情冷淡，情意不合；例如丈夫在外面嫖蕩冶遊，妻子不耐寂寞，另結新歡……這種不合理畸形的夫婦生活，無論在報紙上或是友人傳說，時常可以聽得到的。本來。夫婦結合應該美滿的而陶醉的；但因何而竟生出這樣的惡果呢？其原因固然有種種不同，但其中主要者，厥因夫婦間發生性的障礙所致。本來，維持夫婦生活的基礎，就在性愛的健全，若失此能力，無論其他環境怎樣幸福，怎樣舒適，家庭依然不會美滿，能發生墳墓般的冷淡感覺。　　如上文所述，性的障礙，不得不認為是夫婦間愛情破裂的主因。但性的障礙之發生，在男子方面，類多因性的神經衰弱症而起，例如幼年時代手淫過度，或新婚後性交過度，都是些致罹性的神經衰弱的原因。早洩，陽痿，遺精等都是因上述原因而誘起的症狀。　　在女人方面，祗是冷淡症與不感症兩種。此外多年不孕，也是使感情破壞，因不姙之後，丈夫每因此另結新歡，所以夫婦間無論那一方面，若發現前述症狀時，務須早期施以適當治療　　關於其治療方法，根據全世界的著名學者，如哥崙比亞大學生理學教授畢克羅氏Professor　Bigelow及德國柏林大學生理學教授摩西氏Moses，法國著名學者皮哈德氏ezardP等等，均一致推崇優秀之真正生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」因其能使早洩陰萎短期根治，其女用者尤能調經種子而補充健美，如患遺精，同時以「希米脫氏固精片」治之，關於這兩藥的效力，依余多年來的經驗，實為一切內分泌製劑及遺精劑中的權威，在歐美各國的醫學界，早有定評，故余回國後曾與不姙者（編者按：真正「生殖素」及「固精片」概裝鐵盒，慎勿悞購紙盒瓶裝僞品，致害病機）性病講座  姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編　　診所　四川路北京路口中國信託公司二樓　門診　上午十時至下午六時，星期日休息　　（一）手淫遺精發育被阻　　患者顧青泉，年十八歲，四川成都人，現肄業本埠某教會學校，主訴——因脫不了青年之惡習，在十五歲正當發育時，即喜與異性交遊，淫畫浪畫，目不暇接，因之即染手淫，日日摧殘，雖知其害而欲戒絕，無奈意志不堅。迄難成功，反因此益嚴重，刻已變無夢之滑精，每於夜間毫無知覺中洩精，現更有失眠之患，且腰　悲痛，晨起貪眠，作事無心，錯誤百出，神經亦衰弱不堪，面黃肌瘦，已非昔變，刻校中功課忙繁，更形焦急，故來投治，現在症——生殖腺顯現變態，精關更寬弛不堪，治療方法——投以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」促其生殖腺健全，並服鐵盒裝之真正「希米脫氏固精片」以止遺安神，同時割除包皮，更施以電療，如是治療五星期，各病霍然獲愈，而各部亦發育長大，勝於常人矣。　　（二）早婚停經永難得孕　　患者褚玉笙君，年三十歲，無錫人，主訴——四年前結婚，迄未生育，生活殊感單調，而高堂抱孫心切，更為難堪，然不姙之原因，恐在弱冠時性慾甚旺，縱欲過度，以致性能短促，一觸即洩，而身體亦顯然衰老，以故腎虧腰　，衰弱異常，褚夫人亦患月經不調，超前落後，皆無定時，甚至有二三月不來者，體質衰弱，無以倫比，現在症——褚君生殖腺已呈涸老，失却活力之營養，性神經更覺過敏，其夫人純係生殖腺內分泌反常，以故經期難準，治療方法——褚君除服真正鐵盒裝之「生殖素」以滋潤增強生殖腺外，再施行電療，其夫人則服「女用生殖素」以調經補體，治療三月，褚君性能恢復，體重亦增加十磅，行房時更勝任愉快，其夫人亦經順體壯，面色紅潤，更增嬌豔，四月後，得其自無錫來信，云已懷孕三月，此皆先生與名藥所賜，合家均感謝不置，尤以愚夫婦之幸福，亦賴以幸獲，更將永感不忘云　　白帶克治　　浙江海門北街沈裕隆雜貨店沈　涇君來函云：內子體弱多病，患白帶尤烈，屢治勿愈，下部惡臭異常，終年不潔，不勝痛苦，後幸經鄰友方漢銘君之介紹，至申藥美藥房購得「療帶靈」並「女用生殖素」各三盒，現已用完而帶亦凈體亦壯云。　　胃痛迅愈　　本埠元芳路七百廿號孫庭芳君來函云：余患胃痛將三十年，痛苦異常，迄未得良藥以治，四月前小兒忽購得「健胃素」及「胃痛靈」二藥回，云甚靈　，余恐再受劣藥之愚心存猶預，不了服後，果見奇效，刻已治愈迄未再痛，不道六十老翁尚能重獲康健，靈藥實堪推荐　　發育不全　　河南洛陽城東大街六號邵成璋君來函云：余現年廿六歲，在十年前因犯手淫惡癖至使發育受阻，迄至去冬尚如孩童，後得友人介紹內服「生殖素」，二月後，各部發育皆有異常進步，迄至現在已與常人無異而有過之，誠希世聖藥。　　陽痿早洩　　廣州　林一家春酒樓許松碩君來函云：愚夫婦結婚已達十載，迄未得真情之藥，蓋余因罹有早洩及陽痿之症，而內子亦有月經不調之患，以故生趣全無，何來恩愛，幸今春至戚梁君自上海來，携有「男女生殖素」各半打，愚夫婦服之所患俱愈，因以恩愛勝似新婚云通俗醫藥青年自凟的弊害剖視  詹念曾醫師　　青年的過度手淫，其弊害九時容易疲倦，及腿臂脊的酸痛，頭壳覺得有重壓，頭痛，以及腸胃氣脹的消化不良，還有背痛，失眠，心悸等症。假若發生遺精頻繁，那末除上述幾種症候之外，便發現局部有不能收束小便之感覺。或者在排尿後又滴出二三滴尿，沾汙襯褲。又在尿液尚未積貯充分，便催起尿意；炎症因侵入輸精管（精虫之出口）便發生滑精症候在這時期內，射精時並無快感；病勢激劇時，雖在白日，因些微動機，也能惹起射精現象。此時若再不設法根治，全身的營養衰退，肌肉削瘦，康健遂失去保障，一切病象當必結夥而來。基於醫學的立場，向青年進一忠告；要止治遺精，必須鞏固精關。因精關治固之後，心神清定，入夜桃色夢幻，自可減少，夢遺當能停止。據世界著名的性病學者，如英國醫學博士大衛克樂，D．W．Clow　M.D.德國性病專家哈勃得格萊氏Herbert　Gray俄國掰利夫氏Galliffe及羅馬教會著名醫生雷慈博Dr．Leo．T．Latz等表示，關於遺精的治法，除精神的　養外，應推「希米脫氏固精片」最佳，服此能使精關鞏固，遺精根治，如因遺精之後，陷入神經衰弱而患陽痿早洩者，應以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』挽救之，功效愈顯。國外醫訉各國少女乳峯美醜的全貌  德國醫學博士張君實著　　……西方女子的乳房比較東方女子為優　……德國失健女子的科學補救大收成效　　乳房美的問題，在女性方面尤佔重要。女性美的全部要素，也無疑地以乳房發育為中心。乳房發育的重要，據德國的一位有名生理學家普賴斯博士證實，女性的乳房發育，不僅增加幾分美觀，且與女子一生的健康有密切之關係，假若發育不全，乳房萎　，那末健康定必喪失無疑。　　據英國『美容雜誌』所載：「乳房美的為題，並不只以大小為標準。大的房面說，歐洲婦人以外，如薩摩亞Samoa，該羅Cairo安南等婦人，非常豐大。雖然她們的乳房那樣肥大，但並不是美的。較小的乳房，雖不算好，過大也不一定算美。因為過大將胸前的低位佔滿，更將她的曲線埋沒。試看安南婦人的胸前，是否美觀，就可以知道。」　　以此足證西方女子乳房的美，並不在乳房肥大，而在乳峯高聳，比較東方婦人是佔優位。所以西方婦人的乳房，在世界上，可以說是最美的乳房，其中以巴黎，瑞典，匈牙利，奧大利及德國等女子的乳房，最受一般人的讚美。近據調查：一九三三年柏林一地共有乳　失健不姙的女子五萬九千六百五十四人，政府認為有礙優生政策的推行，乃嚴令柏林所有醫院用生殖腺素製劑女用「生殖素」加以治療。降至今年六月底，柏林市政廳調查乳　失健不姙的女子，祗有四千五百七十二人，據各醫學專家觀察，不到二年可全部治愈，從此柏林一地，絕無一衰弱的女子矣。德國年來的努力優生學說，已收成效，觀今年的世運，足證德意志民族的強壯已列世界第一。　　「女用生殖素」，係將動物之腦下垂體，甲狀腺及睾丸雄壯動物的生殖腺，經細心精密之科學的方法提煉而成。其效力，能助長發育，尤其女性的臀部於乳房，調整月經，如嫌子女衰弱，服此可產生健全的子女，故尤為不姙者的有力挽救，無怪德政府的獎勵不已。戒烟心得談談培補戒煙法之優點  賈治中醫師　　効力超羣，非他法可與比並　安全迅速，戒煙者莫不稱道　　五年計劃的拒毒運動，轉瞬即届，可是一般吸烟的人，大多數還是徘徊觀忘，不肯澈底的戒除煙毒，難首他們甘蹈法網，視國法爲兒戲嗎？我想决没有這樣愚蠢的人吧！據我臨診所知，他們並非不知煙毒之害，實在是忍受不起戒煙時的種種痛苦，因爲他們吸煙成癮，煙毒已滿佈全身，非藉煙的刺激，不能使精神興奮，一旦戒吸，即萎頓不安，失眠遺精，腰痠骨痛等徵象疊起，試想，以吸煙者的衰弱身體，怎能抵抗，無怪視戒煙如畏途了，但自培補戒焑法施行後，吸者可不必憂慮上項的痛苦了，而且效力超羣，安全迅速，全球賴此戒絶的煙民，不知凡幾，手術又很簡單，祗要服以大量之生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」並注射「育維賜保命」，使生殖腺恢復原有之機罷，而發生强有力之抗毒素，不難毫無痛苦而迅速戒絶，曾有烏過庭君，投余戒煙；余即以上述培補法戒之，二月而完全戒絶，烏君云：余吸煙達十五年，戒已數次，總因苦於精神不繼，疾病纏綿而未果，此次逼於法令，竟成安全而無痛苦戒絶，實非始料所及，眞戒煙者之幸福云。骨痛常識臨診一得……　治療骨痛之秘訣  俞伯符醫師　　應充實擇藥的常識　更須要治本的良藥　　在從前關於骨痛的治療，向無適當的對症良藥，一則由於醫藥家的墨守舊法，不肯作更深的探討，二則由於患者的不自覺，意為無關大要，甚至壯年及青年也都罹有骨痛，久坐操作，或長途步行，或風濕雨天，或時令交節，偶一遇到，即感骨節疼痛，四肢酸麻，甚至不能行動，形同癱瘓，痛楚備嘗，最近美國強斯登氏醫藥博士發明一種骨痛聖藥名「強斯登氏骨痛片」，因效果確實，莫不譽為驚人聖藥，有陸仲秋者，年四十二歲，一生操勞，更兼年青時好色，曾患花柳，以故濕毒交倂而罹骨痛，已十餘年，求醫問卜，不知費了許多金錢，而骨痛依然未愈，今春經余囑用「強斯登氏骨痛片」後，未及二月而完全根治，半年來從未復發，且強壯勝昔云。自療常識淋病怎樣才能根治！  香港醫科醫大學醫學學士吳大超　　關於淋病者的煩惱，固然有無可形容的痛苦。故時常有人問我說：「我的淋症，能治得好嗎？幾時治好？」　　這些人大都是想結婚的青年人，所以這是一個頂重要的問題，不但關乎他本身，而且關乎他將來的妻室與兒女，為了這些理由，淋病的治療方法，不得不求迅速的進步，以免害及無辜的妻子。　　一九三三年全世界的著名淋病學者，如瑪利爾醫士Dr．Muller，福開森博士Ferguson及美國的普賴斯花柳病專家等證實；患者的攝養，實為最要，對於飲食，不可吃　有刺激性的食物，如酸，辣，酒醋，烟等物，此外對於藥物療法，以黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵林」最可靠，不但能早起根治，且絕無副作用。當我在英時，彼邦名醫一致推崇此合製劑的功效，余回國後，已見該藥受中國醫學界的歡迎採用，故余時藉此為大的治淋藥劑，根治不少的淋病患者，一年中之少有六千人之多，效果之確實，為任何淋藥所不及。</p>

<p>申報國慶特刊紀念論文國難與國慶  患予　　目　的國難太嚴重了，所以我們雖是逢到了國慶令節，似乎也鼓不起興致來祝賀。一般人大槪這樣想：在這樣的局面之下，卽使應景祝賀，也不過是「强顏歡笑」罷了，有甚麽意思！其實，正因為國難太嚴重了，逢到國慶令節不可不祝賀一番。强顏歡笑　中未始不足以激起「發憤自强」的情緒；儘是悲痛，又有甚麽道理！　　所謂國難，所謂國慶，都以人民的國家觀念為基礎。如果人民的國家觀念很淡薄，那末雖有嚴重的國難，也感不着怎樣的悲痛；雖逢到國慶的日子，也想不到要祝賀了。　　人民的國家觀念，並非與生俱來，是從環境造成的。國難和國慶的紀念，都是提醒人民國家觀念的絕好機會。　　「國家」這個詞，雖屬於有數可數的表集合體的普通名詞，但是無形可指，看不出實在的髒質，近乎一種虛體的名稱。所以對於渾然天眞的人民談國家，往往莫名其妙。他們只知道「日出而作，日入而息，鑿井而飮，耕田而食」，對於國家的存在，茫然無所知，眞所謂「帝力何有於我哉」！　　國家有一種極大的功能，就是「外禦其侮」。這種功能在平時不容易感覺，所以渾然天眞的人民對於國家之所感是「帝力何有於我哉」。一到遇着外侮一的時候，這種功能就非常明顯，一向以為「帝力何有於我哉」的人民，也莫不因外侮的刺激，而認識國家的存在，並且感到維持國家存在的需要了。　　九一八以來，誰都感覺到我國人民的國家觀念，一天普遍一天。此後迭次事變的結果，我國土地和主權雖受了不少的損失，我國人民雖是直接或間接受了不少的痛苦，但是這樣嚴重的國難的敎訓，已經使得已成為很有力的暗流，非任何威力陰謀所能消滅。那些打算用威力陰謀加以遏制的企圖不但是徒勞，說不定還會促成一個機會，使這暗流化為高潮。所以，我們不必為着國難的嚴重而儘是悲痛，我們應該咬緊牙關，忍着千辛萬苦，在這有力的暗流中奮勇前進。　　前進需要相當的勇氣。勇氣並非虛驕之氣，當然不是一朝一夕所能作成，要從實行方面日積月累培養起來的。我們的環境，我們所遭遇的事實，已經足以培養我們所需要的勇氣；由於外力的逼迫，我們是站在有進無退的局勢中，大家感覺到，非鼓足勇氣前進，是沒有生路的。但是逢到適當的機會，也應該把大家的勇氣來鼓舞一下。祝賀國慶須是一個再適當沒有的好機會。祝賀國慶本有培養人民國家觀念的作用，就此機會來鼓舞人民前進的勇氣，眞是再適當沒有的了。　　祝賀國慶似乎只是鼓舞昇平，其實不盡然。在昇平時候祝賀國慶，其作用彷彿惟恐人民沈溺於「帝力何有於我」的空氣中，而敎大家不要拋棄了國家觀念。在國難嚴重的時候祝賀國慶，是在人民國家觀念滋長的過程中，使其因紀念國家的誕生而更確認其國家觀念，其作用實在比在昇平的時候，更加重要。　　國家觀念的內容並不簡單，而且有好幾個要點是歷來學者所聚訟不决的。所以人民如何發揮其國家觀念而為國家努力，也不是簡單的事情；在國難嚴重到千鈞一髮的今日，人民如何接受國難的敎訓而為國努力尤其不是簡單的事情。我想最適合需要的國家觀念，應該是根據着歷史敎訓的。我們應當憑着歷史敎訓來應付國難，我們應當知道，國慶日是解除國難的進程中値得紀念的一個日子。在國難嚴重的時候祝賀國慶，正好仔細檢討與此紀念日有關的歷史敎訓，針對當前的國難，而决定其努力之方策。　　祝賀國慶最重要的意義是紀念先烈，是檢討與此紀念日有關的歷史經騐。辛亥革命的成就雖不澈底，但是先烈開創中華民國的艱難困苦畢竟是値得紀念的，「登高自卑，行遠自邇」，我們對於前人的初步工作，實在不容忽視，要知道中華民國的締造全仗先烈們篳路襤褸的苦幹精神。這種精神，正是我國民應付當前國難所最需要的。　　然而我們踏着先烈的血跡前進，却還得把先烈所遺下的失敗的敎訓檢討一番。翻閱我國的現代史，便可知道辛亥革命是從鴉片戰爭中日戰爭等迭决列强侵略而起的反應。而那决革命雖是先烈們的血造成的，可並不澈底。我們正應該細心檢討如何會造成這不澈底的原因。這一類的歷史敎訓是非常寳貴的，我們應該隨時隨地回味着，這才可以尋求自己努力的途徑，完成先烈未了的工作。　　在嚴重國難中的同胞們，當「强顏歡笑」地祝賀着這國慶令節的時候，大家把先烈們的苦幹精神，以及所遺的歷史敎訓來揣摩一番吧。這於我們為民族解放的奮鬭多少是有益的。雙十感言  吳凱聲　　一年一度之雙十節，在以往軍閥割據跋扈時期，被用為粉飾太平之工具，固無慶賀之可言，處國民政府成立以後，宜若可以掃嚮日國慶日之沉霾矣。乃全國甫經底定，建設尙未開展之際，二十年九一八之變卽作，金甌破缺，慶於何有？嗣是而國難之嚴重，日甚一日，吾人卽欲為太平之粉飾，亦不可得矣。迄於今年，關於國內方面，一切建設事業，已逐漸開展，而眞正之統一大業，亦吿成功，此應為國人之歡欣鼓舞者也。惟以對外關係，因不幸事件之速續發生，致中日外交，突趨緊漲，舉國惴惴，大有風雨欲來之勢。而日軍隊在虹口閘北各處之舉動。益使人心惶恐不安，坐是而雙十節國慶，又將不能太平度過矣。欲吾之寫出感言，又將從何處言之乎？　　茲者中日外交，共已至最嚴重之最後時期，日本人作如是觀，中國人亦皆作如是觀也。吾人就此問題，加以論述，以別於每年循例之無聊文字，想為中日兩國人士所樂聞也。　　中國與日本之關係，從縱的方面言，文同文，族同種，固兄弟之邦也；從橫的方面言，國門相望，利害相通，向為東亞水陸之大國，固唇齒之邦也。乃旣不幸有九一八，一二八等事之演出，以大傷中國國民之情威，又不幸兩國誤會過甚，徒責備一方之趨從，癥結愈結而愈深，以有今日之緊漲的不幸狀態，吾人不須硏究造成此狀態之責任究將　　，祇以愷切　　的態度，剖析兩國之利害關係，以呈獻於兩國民衆之前。　　迄於成都事件發生之前止，中日兩網外交，在於調整邦交之一階段，兩國當局，亦均努力於此，徒以為連續的不幸事伴為之梗，致使前途險惡。此悲哀之局之如何打開，吾人深信第一應以外交手段解决為原則，而不應愚笨的任意行使實力，以兩敗俱傷，為人所乘。要知今日世界之局勢，已至極嚴重時期，在歐洲方面，已有西班牙內戰而策動所謂人民陣線興獨裁國際之　爭，危機四伏，各國莫不在準備厮殺，其動盪之局，實足以波動世界和平而有餘，况眈眈者，孰不願擇肥而噬，向外發展耶。苟中日關係，不幸而外交方式解决之途徑已窮，兩國先歐洲而發動戰爭，吾人相信日本之武力，絕不足以消滅整個中國，至其極中國固殘破不堪，日本亦未必能完整無缺，戰禍相尋，勢不至兩國互消共國力不止。卽使日本足以消滅中國，在日本未及領有中國之時，其他國家，又將乘日本之敝矣，此日本有議之土所共知也。至於中國，其對於外交方針，早經確定，卽「和平未到絕望時期，决不放棄和平，犧牲未到最後關頭，决不輕言犧性」是也，至其限度，以不妨害我國領土及主權之完整為原則。甚願國人持之以忍，勿為感情所激發，勿為反動份子所誘惑，徒逞匹夫之小憤，致貽政府當局折衝之困難，而破壞完整之大局，待至庶政及建設事業之逐步完成，則根基旣固，殆何所圖而不可乎？　　此上乃就雙方面言之也。吾人舍去主觀的中日關係之視察，單獨以利害之點言之，中國係大陸國家，日本係海洋國家，一則滯留於農業時代，一則工商各業，皆有其相當發達，而一水相隔，一葦可航，日本應認識中國之復興，不特為中國之福，其有利於日本也，亦較諸歐美任何國家為甚。蓋中國一日不能復興，則其社會繁榮之期亦日難臻至，馴至如今日之農村經濟破產，社會百業凋敝，人民牛活力且降至水準之下，遑論其購買力哉，以毫無購買力之市塲，試問於日人為有利乎？抑無利乎？此點利害極明顯，理由極簡單，豈待智者而始見之乎？反之中國得早日復興，其自身之富力旣臻雄厚，則其間接直接貢獻於世界者，亦必雄厚。日本與中國，固兄弟之邦也，語云，「近水樓台先得月」，則日本以中國之復興，對日本工商業必有極大乏利得，而日本工商業界，將决不至再慮貨品之出路矣，又何必暴虎憑河，死而無悔，將半壁東亞大陸，舉而共同投畀深淵乎？　　今日者，已至兩國雙方猛然醒悟之最後時期，中國固願竭誠的於合理解决之下，努力尋求敦睦邦交之道：而在日本方面，允應勿事張大，着着進迫，總期於善意的立塲上，求外交之出路，以打開目前僵局，茲桑島氏已携其重要使令，俾策助川越大使於吾國外交當局相見矣。則所謂陸海外三省之共同意見者，其表現將如何？互相毀滅乎？兩國親善乎？前途之開展，全繫乎此，吾人殆極希望日方之亦能如吾人之心平氣和，勿越於常軌之外也。否則中國前途，吾人固已待厄運之來也久矣，未知我友邦能具有同此恐懼吾？於茲國慶日，切望中日間得有幸福之開展！國民經濟建設概論  張白衣　　經濟的廣義卽是生活。國民經濟建設的唯一目的卽在縱持國民生活。目前我國國民不會利用自己的生活資源來維持自己的生活，却讓別人去利用去享受我們的生活資源。饑餓與貧窮這綫支配着我國國民的生活。　　根據客觀環境的需要，中國國民經濟建設是急不容緩了。無論要收回已失的生活資源，或要確保未失的生活資源，都非大家趕緊來努力於國民經濟建設不可！　　現在，分四部份來談談這個問題。這四部份就是日常所云的衣食住行四項。　　衣的方面　　衣服　為國民生活必需的物品，但是本國的生產量尙不敷國民的消費量，每年有巨量的外貨進口。據最近民國二十五年上半年的貿易數字報吿，吾人可以發現衣服類的商品淮口甚大，如棉布計二百八十二萬金單位，棉織品五十萬金單位，蔴織品計二百九十四萬金單位，毛織品一百三十五金單位，棉花一千〇九十八萬金單位，棉紗三十八萬金單位，蔴七十六萬金單位，羊毛三百三十六萬金單位，粗細絨錢五十萬金單位，人造絲九十七萬金單位，生皮熟皮等一百〇六萬金單位，總計半年間衣服類商品進口價値達二千五百六十三萬金單位，每一金單位合國幣二元二角四分計，則為五千七百四十一萬元，佔進口總額百分之一二·六〇。下半年如與上半年呈同調，則全年須由外國供給衣服類商品總値一億一千四百八十二萬元。　　然而，中國衣服類竟不能自給嗎？事實吿訴我們：棉織品生產量足以自給，惟棉花生產尙不足，但可增產，毛織品工業未臻發達之境，中國羊毛質雖不佳，尙可改種，且羊毛出口甚大，故國產羊毛如施以加工，仍可為毛織工業的原料，蔴織品原料出口甚大，可惜中國蔴織工業不發達，絲織品是不成問題的可以自給，人造絲的原料本國甚多，祗需期待人造絲工業的建立；皮貨皮革等中國原為生產國，可惜本國煉製皮貨的工業設備太小了！由此可見中國衣服資源都相當豐富，棉花雖感不足，但列世界產棉三等國，為什麽我中國每年尙須以一億元向外國購買衣服商品呢？如果技術與資本的結合，創立新式工業，則中國衣服毫無問題的可以自給了。茲將衣服方面各部門的建設和改進的計劃分述如后。　　棉織品　先從棉織品原料的棉花來說：我國棉花尙不能自給，民國二十五年上半期棉花入超有一千四百萬元。而棉花在戰時又為軍需火藥的主要原料，故不諭從經濟的見地或軍事的見地，均須以自給為原則。解决棉花不足問題，一為利甩墓地荒地以增加其種植的　面積，二為普遍的改美國種，以减其製織時的浪費，三為科學的種植　如施肥料等以增加其收穫。决從棉紡織工業來說：中國棉紡織工廠已相當的發達，故問題不在於棉紡織品生產、數量的不足，乃在於本國棉紡織品市塲的被外國所奪，外國所以能奪取中國市塲，乃在於彼等低價傾銷與夫在華設廠的特殊優勢。故中國棉織品並非不足供應本國市塲的需要。欲解决此難題，最可能的惟有國人消極的不用外貨，同時在華廠方面如華棉得以自給時，務須低價供應市塲。　　毛織品　中國毛織業目前所用的羊毛均為外毛，本年上半年羊毛輸入達七百五十三萬元。但同時中國同期輸出羊毛亦達八百四十五萬元，可知我國本十羊毛如經科學的加工，仍可製織衣服用品，可惜中國缺乏此項技術。我國羊毛自己雖不重視，而已為別人重視，蓋自東北羊毛施行改種後，收效甚大，法以外來種與</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Relations: Crisis Temporarily Avoided, Disagreement on North China, Kawagoe and Zhang Qun to Continue Negotiations, Many Difficulties Ahead According to Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry commented on the meeting between President Chiang and Ambassador Kawagoe on the 8th, stating briefly that although optimism is not yet warranted, since President Chiang expressed full support for the basic concept of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, at least the crisis of a breakdown can be avoided for the time being. There is hope for breaking through the difficulties and continuing negotiations. However, China seems to harbor some dissatisfaction with Japan's proposals, as it emphasizes the spirit of mutual concessions and reciprocal equality. In fact, although President Chiang is prepared to express sympathy on other issues, there is a clear difference in views between Chiang and Japan on the issue of North China. Japan believes that the North China issue is a prerequisite for adjusting the entire relationship and will reject any counter-proposals from China. The Foreign Ministry's criticism concluded that while a reasonable resolution of the entire negotiation is impossible, once the basic principles are decided, a joint committee will be appointed to negotiate the details, which is not impossible. (9th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry told reporters today that apart from the previously released communique of the meeting between President Chiang and Ambassador Kawagoe, he had nothing to announce. However, he said that this was only the first official meeting, and Ambassador Kawagoe will continue negotiations with Foreign Minister Zhang. If necessary, he will meet with President Chiang again. He also believes that it is too early to express either optimism or pessimism at this time. It is reported that the official report of the meeting between Ambassador Kawagoe and President Chiang arrived at the Foreign Ministry at 2:00 AM on the 9th without requesting special instructions. Although Foreign Minister Arita is slightly unwell, he still convened a meeting of Foreign Ministry leaders today. Tokyo attaches great importance to the news of foreign envoys gathering in Nanjing. (9th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newspapers here have not yet commented on the meeting between President Chiang Kai-shek and Ambassador Kawagoe, but there is an impression that although the current deadlock has been broken, there are still many difficulties ahead. Therefore, diplomatic negotiations will be extremely lengthy. Local newspapers stated that Ambassador Kawagoe said during the meeting that the people of China and Japan should work together to implement the guiding principle of "taking common interests as interests and eliminating common disadvantages at the same time." He also said that the work of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations should not be limited to passively suppressing anti-Japanese sentiments, but should move further towards the common goal of striving for friendship. It is also reported that President Chiang Kai-shek regards mutual concessions and reciprocal equality as prerequisites and clearly expressed his sincerity in genuinely improving relations with Japan. One or two newspapers here deeply worry that there is no hope for establishing concrete plans agreed upon by both sides regarding joint anti-communism and the North China issue. Ambassador Kawagoe told Japanese correspondents stationed in Nanjing that President Chiang Kai-shek has extraordinary enthusiasm for eliminating the current crisis and adjusting the entire relationship between China and Japan. In addition, President Chiang has a considerable understanding of Japan's attitude, but he raised certain hopes regarding the North China issue. Kawagoe also said that although there are obstacles ahead, diplomatic negotiations are not hopeless. At present, it cannot be said that the situation has improved or worsened. Kawagoe continued that he does not want to give up hope for negotiations; on the contrary, he will continue to do his best. (9th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After calling on President Chiang on the 8th, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe told Japanese reporters that he may need to meet with President Chiang two or three more times. According to diplomatic sources, the date for Kawagoe's next meeting with President Chiang has not yet been determined. Regarding specific Sino-Japanese issues, Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang will hold their fourth meeting to continue discussions. Although the date has not yet been determined, it is likely to be around the 13th. It is expected that within a week after the National Day commemoration, the negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations will bring hope for the circulation of the past gloomy atmosphere. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe and President Chiang yesterday, Sino-Japanese negotiations were spared from breaking down. However, the overall situation is still not promising for excessive optimism. This is the general opinion of the Foreign Ministry after receiving Ambassador Kawagoe's report on the meeting. Foreign Ministry officials are currently discussing Ambassador Kawagoe's report. The opinion of many officials here is that Foreign Minister Zhang Qun should only handle specific details. Newspapers here have different views on the news of Kawagoe's meeting with Chiang yesterday, but they unanimously believe that there will inevitably be many difficulties in the future of the negotiations, so they will take a long time. Most newspapers admit that Chiang seems to have expressed great enthusiasm for promoting a satisfactory resolution. (9th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report late last night on the content of yesterday's meeting between Ambassador Kawagoe and President Chiang. Judging from the progress of negotiations prepared by Consul-General Suma and key figures in the Chinese government, the Chinese side seems to be sincere in conducting negotiations with Japan. Moreover, when Chiang Kai-shek met with Ambassador Kawagoe on the 8th, he expressed full agreement with the fundamental significance of adjusting Sino-Japanese national relations. Therefore, although the future is not promising for optimism, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is convinced that the difficult hurdle has been overcome and that negotiations have begun to get on track. It is heard that as negotiations proceed, a joint committee may be established to discuss detailed matters, which is not out of the question. (9th Domei News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Detailed telegrams about the content of the first meeting between Kawagoe and Chiang on the 8th arrived at the Foreign Ministry on the morning of the 9th. Foreign Minister Arita invited the heads of departments to hold important discussions at the Prime Minister's residence this morning. Judging from the first meeting between Chiang and Kawagoe, there seems to be no need to send a telegram of instruction. The Kawagoe-Chiang meeting was conducted under considerable friendship. China and Japan have reached a consensus on the general outline of principles. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry authorities are convinced that they can open up Sino-Japanese relations through the continuation of diplomatic negotiations. In the future, it is possible to hold meetings with Chiang at any time as necessary. However, it is necessary to discuss concrete issues based on the principles of the Kawagoe-Chiang meeting. Therefore, the Kawagoe-Zhang Qun meeting, which was interrupted since the 23rd of last month, will be revived within three days and formal discussions will begin. (9th Domei News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sino-Japanese negotiations will reopen on the 12th or 13th, after the Double Tenth Festival. The Chinese side, under the discretion of Chiang Kai-shek, is reviewing the deadlock of the third meeting between Kawagoe and Zhang Qun and carefully studying countermeasures. Until the next formal negotiation, preparatory negotiations will continue to be quite frequent. If a way to break the deadlock can be found, formal negotiations can proceed accordingly. The Japanese authorities stationed abroad continue to hold meetings of the heads of departments today. Ambassador Kawagoe, Army Attaché Kita, Navy Attaché Sato, Consul-General Suma, and others have decided on countermeasures. At present, they are only waiting to see what the Chinese side will do. Army Attaché Kita and Navy Attaché Sato will return to Shanghai by overnight train tonight. (9th Domei News Agency telegram)</p>
<h3>President Chiang Banquets the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang and his wife, Ms. Zhu Meiling, hosted a banquet at their residence at 8:00 PM on the 9th for British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and his wife and daughter. Gan Chonghui, Kong Xiangxi, and their respective spouses were invited to accompany them. (9th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<h3>Imai Talks: Fengtai is Peaceful</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Imai, since the misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese troops in Fengtai was resolved, it has been very peaceful so far. All kinds of rumors are not credible. Chief of Staff Hashimoto is scheduled to come to Beiping on the evening of the 9th or the morning of the 10th to celebrate your country's National Day. As for the Japanese setting up a police station in Fengtai, it is not known. Imai believes that the development of North China's economy and navigation issues are all rumors.

<h3>President Chiang Publishes "China's Unification and Construction"—Written to Commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China—The Achievements of the Past Eight Years are Unprecedented in Chinese History—In the Future, We Only Seek the Opportunity for Unobstructed Self-Defense and Development</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, President Chiang of the Executive Yuan published an article to domestic and foreign audiences on the 9th, entitled "China's Unification and Construction." The original text was in English, specially prepared for English-speaking readers. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially translated it as follows for the reference of the Chinese people: Since the development of steam, radio, wireless communication, and air navigation, the relationship between nations has undergone a tremendous change. Anything that happens in any country is instantly spread throughout the world. China, in this era, can no longer close itself off and remain unknown to the world as it did in the past. However, the more rumors there are about China, the more misunderstandings are caused. Since China's reconstruction of the republic, the united efforts of the whole country have been focused on the unification of the country internally and the pursuit of freedom and equality among nations externally. Overthrowing the imperial system and establishing a republic in this transitional era of changing old and new systems involves political, social, and family issues, and even affects the interests of foreigners. Since the domestic situation is so complex, it is very difficult for outsiders to observe fairly and give a frank judgment. Therefore, there are still those who regard today's China as an unorganized country. Such misunderstandings prevent China from gaining full sympathy in the world, and China's construction work, which has been striving for day and night in recent years, has fallen into a situation where it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, I would like to express some feelings to English-speaking readers at home and abroad. On this day of universal celebration, I think there is no other appropriate topic that can meet the expectations of eliminating international misunderstandings other than "China's Unification and Construction." The first point that friendly countries should pay attention to is that today's China is no longer comparable to the disintegrated state of the past. In the 50 years before the establishment of the republic in 1912, the authority of the central government declined day by day, and the arrogance of local authorities increased day by day. This trend led to the separation of warlords and caused endless internal strife. The people suffered unspeakable disasters. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, disputes have arisen from time to time. The separation of warlords has not been completely eliminated, and in addition to civil war, there is also the disturbance of communist bandits. The people are suffering, the cities are reduced to ashes, the peasants leave their villages, and the fields are barren. Apart from robbery, burning, and killing, there is almost no work to be done. Such a state of terror is enough to make the rulers of a country helpless. However, the Chinese government knows that if it wants to seek the construction of the country, it must first seek the unification of the country. Therefore, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has worked hard every day to complete unification and restore order. In recent years, the government has implemented plans to eradicate communism and all other reactionary forces step by step with firm and unwavering determination. Therefore, after the communist bandit nest of Jiangxi was recovered in 1933, the Red Party in various places such as Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou was also successively suppressed. It is not difficult to eliminate the small number of remnants scattered in the border areas. Therefore, the forces of communist bandits and warlords are no longer a worry for China. Moreover, with the pacification of the Fujian Incident and the compliance of Guangdong and Guangxi, the unification of China has reached the point of being nearly complete. The second point to pay attention to is that China has implemented plans for revival and construction in the midst of extreme difficulties. Suppressing banditry is difficult, and it is even more difficult to rectify the security and economy of the areas disturbed by bandits and communists. Coping with these difficulties naturally requires a spirit of courage and innovation. The people have suffered from turmoil and have long lost order and unity. Therefore, the ancient Chinese Baojia system is used, and new methods are used to promote the responsibilities of mutual assistance, mutual defense, and mutual supervision among the people in villages, so that unscrupulous elements have no chance to take advantage of it. More than 80% of the Chinese people are peasants. If we want to seek construction, we must first revive the countryside. Therefore, in 1934, the government ordered that no more surcharges be added to the land tax, and then repeatedly ordered the abolition of harsh taxes. To date, more than 5,000 types have been abolished, reducing the burden on the people by as much as 50 million yuan per year. In recent years, the National Government has spent huge sums on water conservancy and dike construction projects, spending 35 million yuan in the short period of one year last year. From now on, if we continue to do so, the disasters of drought and flood can be avoided. Cooperative undertakings are also very developed today, with a total of 26,224, of which 12,517 were formed last year. The Ministry of Industry recently established a Cooperative Department to promote cooperative undertakings throughout the country. In addition, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank was established with a capital of 60 million yuan, half from the government and half from the people. Its purpose is to use the full power of the government and society to promote loans to farmers and the transportation and marketing of agricultural products. The best way to show the progress in transportation is with numbers. Railways have increased from 8,000 kilometers in 1925 to 13,000 kilometers. The paved roads have been completed for 96,555 kilometers, and those under construction have 16,000 kilometers. In the past, it took months to travel from Nanjing to Guangzhou or by boat and carriage. Now, it can be reached in a few days by car. Air navigation was unheard of in China ten years ago, but today it can reach major cities such as Hankou, Chengdu, Beiping, and Guangzhou from Shanghai, and even the border provinces of Xinjiang. In terms of the number of passengers, taking China National Aviation Corporation as an example, there were only 354 people in 1929, and 10,404 people in the past year. China's construction is not limited to the economy, but also to the promotion of administrative efficiency, the promotion of public health, the implementation of compulsory education, and the improvement of finance. All have been worked hard and achieved remarkable results. What is indicated above is only the general outline. Although this is said to be the general outline, I dare say that with these achievements in this short period of eight years, there is a phenomenon that can be said to be unprecedented in Chinese history. On the day of commemorating the founding of the country, I should not boast to friendly countries about the past achievements of the National Government. We should focus our attention on the unfinished work in the future. However, the reason why I have briefly shown the past situation is to show that China does have the ability to regenerate itself. It has eradicated warlords and bandits and continues to build for the happiness of the people. What it lacks is the opportunity for self-defense and development without interference or obstruction. We have been seeking this opportunity day and night, and we are determined to obtain it. Giving China this opportunity will not only indirectly help China, but it will also be the foundation for world peace. Because China has 400 million peace-loving people and endless resources. Once China is rich and strong, it will undoubtedly be the greatest stabilizing force in the world. (9th Central News Agency telegram)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Ronin Transport Smuggled Sugar, Clash with Customs Officials and Engage in Mutual Assault; Many on Both Sides Injured in Chaotic Situation; Japanese Consul and Customs Commissioner Rush to Stop It</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 PM on the 9th, a civilian ship fully loaded with one hundred bags of smuggled sugar, rowed by six ronin, was sailing upstream along the Hai River, intending to transport it to the Xihe embankment for clandestine sale. When passing the Jintang Bridge, it was intercepted by a Tianjin customs patrol boat. The ronin fled, and the cargo ship was towed to the French Concession customs wharf. Customs coolies were unloading the cargo into the warehouse when the six ronin suddenly arrived to stop them, pointing to a verification slip from the Cang Salt Coastal Defense Inspection Office dated August 20th affixed to the cargo bags as proof of paid taxes, preventing the unloading. A mutual assault ensued, with over a dozen people from both sides suffering head injuries and bleeding.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Resolution: The Regulations for Civil Servant Vacancy Filling Examinations Will Not Be Enacted; Secret Meeting Held After the Session</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 75th session on the morning of the 9th, with 57 members, including Wu Jingxiong, in attendance. Sun Ke chaired the meeting, with Liang Hancao as secretary-general. Matters discussed: (1) The resolution on the third additional budget for national general revenue and expenditure for the 24th year was passed, adding 20,007,720 yuan to both revenue and expenditure as listed in the proposal. (2) The draft interim regulations for temporary civil servant vacancy filling examinations was resolved to be unnecessary to enact. The original draft stipulated that if there were any vacancies for staff in various agencies, they could apply to the Examination Yuan to hold a temporary vacancy filling examination. The Legislative Yuan's review concluded that this method seemed overly trivial. Since staff changes in various agencies are common, holding an examination for each vacancy would be cumbersome. Moreover, since the implementation of the examination law, the Examination Yuan has held many high-level examinations, and recently held temporary high-level examinations, and the general examinations are also gradually being held. The number of people recruited through these examinations is not small, and there are still many who have not been assigned to substantive vacancies. Therefore, if there are staff vacancies in various agencies, there is no need to worry about not finding someone to fill them. Therefore, this case is not actually urgently needed. After a unanimous vote, the proposal was concluded. Liu Yifen requested President Sun to report on the recent Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation, and the meeting was then changed to a secret session. Sun appointed Liang Hancao to report on his behalf, and the meeting adjourned after half an hour. (9th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Double Tenth Festival in a Grave National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The annual Double Tenth Festival has quietly arrived again today. The passage of time is alarming and causes us to be apprehensive. When we speak of National Day, who isn't invigorated? Will we, too, rejoice and be inspired like the people of Washington, D.C., to celebrate the founding of the United States? Will we, too, cheer enthusiastically like the French people to commemorate the establishment of democracy? Looking at today's situation and silently observing our circumstances, we feel only limitless grief and pain interwoven in our hearts. We want to express it, but we can't bear to express it, and yet we cannot help but express it. Hasn't the diplomatic relationship reached its most critical stage? Under the armed threat of the armies of "friendly nations," amidst the extreme agitation of the people in the cities, Shanghai, once known as the Paris of the Orient, is now almost entirely shrouded in terror. Looking north, we hear frequent alarms from Eastern Sui, and the situation in Hebei and Chahar deteriorates daily. The land is covered in gloom, and the sky is filled with evil fog. Who is responsible for this? Who caused it to happen? We, at this moment, cannot force ourselves to be happy, no matter how much we want to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Double Tenth Festival is indeed one of the most glorious turning points in modern Chinese politics. Looking back to twenty-five years ago, when the revolution was launched, the morale was high and the people were roused. There was indeed the potential to strengthen the country and stand up against the weak and incompetent. Finally, thanks to the great sacrifices of the martyrs, we broke free from the shackles of foreign rule, recovered the free spirit of the Yellow Emperor's descendants, and at the same time overthrew the traditional autocratic politics of thousands of years and established a republic and democracy. Whether in terms of historical significance or national stance, it has an indelible spirit to illuminate future generations and endure forever. On this day of grave national crisis, the celebration may be done without enthusiasm, but the meaning of commemoration has become increasingly important. The heroic deeds of the martyrs can serve as a constant spur to us. We should seek inspiration from the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the sake of righteousness, and summon up the courage to carry on. We should remember the hard-earned gains of the martyrs, and strive to wash away the stains on ourselves. Let us not live a life of regret, nor bring shame to the martyrs. This is all that we owe to the martyrs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should know that the main factor contributing to the rapid success of the Xinhai Revolution was the unity of the people. It was because the Qing Dynasty's oppression was too severe and the people's anger was unrestrained that they were able to unite and save themselves. Although the situation has reached a critical point of survival, the national unification has fortunately been completed. From now on, we should be able to concentrate our talents and exert our full strength. In this extraordinary period, we should not indulge in lamentation and self-pity, nor should we take hasty and chaotic steps that lead to panic. We must maintain a firm and composed spirit, with the determination to burn our boats and sink our pots, to shoulder the burden entrusted to us by the martyrs and demonstrate that we have not forgotten this bright and splendid Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3>American Naval Circles Criticize British Proposal Regarding Pacific Defense</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Naval Association today issued a statement expressing surprise at the British proposal to maintain the status quo of Pacific defenses, stating that the British proposal cannot but be regarded as lacking in friendship. We cannot ascertain whether the motive behind this proposal comes from a foreign country or is purely a British position. The association also criticized Japan, saying that Japan has flagrantly violated all the clauses guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and the open door policy. If Japan can immediately withdraw from China, never interfere again, respect American rights in China, and abide by all the restrictions on the defense of mandated islands, allowing the United States to inspect the islands, then the United States would naturally be willing to consider concluding a "gentleman's agreement" to not construct bases in the non-fortification zone of the Pacific.

<p>The US Navy's aircraft carrier, the USS Ranger, has been completed today. Officials are keeping its speed a strict secret, but observers estimate that the ship can travel at least 35 to 38 nautical miles per hour. According to the most reliable sources, the ship has a displacement of 19,000 tons and can carry 79 aircraft. With the completion of this ship, the United States now has six aircraft carriers. Its seventh ship, the USS Wasp, with a displacement of 14,500 tons, will be launched in September 1938. (8th Day National Telegram)</p>

<h3>United States Election: Competition Reaches Its Peak</h3>
<p>(Washington) The election campaign has reached its peak. The Democratic candidate, incumbent President Roosevelt, departed from here today for an eleven-state tour of the Midwest. The motorcade is equipped with a special platform, allowing him to deliver as many as thirty-eight speeches. In addition, he will deliver important speeches in major cities such as Omaha, Chicago, Denver, and Detroit. The itinerary is estimated to be eight to nine thousand kilometers, to be completed within nine days. The Republican candidate, incumbent Kansas Governor Landon, also departed from Topeka today for Illinois, touring the Great Lakes region and delivering campaign speeches. The entire journey will cover six thousand kilometers, to be completed within eight days. According to Republican opinion, the election result will be determined by the votes in the Great Lakes region. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Passes Report: World Economy Improving; European Finance Regaining Credit; Germany and Italy to Join Stable Currencies</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Economic Committee report states that since Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, there has been no time when our hopes for the future have been as strong as they are today. The above report was passed today. The League of Nations Economic Committee requests that governments engage in negotiations as soon as possible to reorganize their entire commercial policies. While there are no current suggestions to convene a new economic conference, the countries concerned have opportunities to openly discuss this issue. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee continued its meeting this morning and immediately passed the following two draft resolutions: (1) A draft resolution jointly proposed by the British and French delegations, advocating that obstacles to international trade, transportation, and exchange rates should be reduced as soon as possible, especially import quotas and currency controls, which should be abolished urgently. (2) A draft resolution proposed by Britain, advocating that all countries should have equal access to various raw materials. Subsequently, the French representative, the country's Minister of Economic Affairs, Spinasse, reported to the committee on the results of the discussion, stating briefly that the currency adjustments of various countries are beneficial to easing people's minds and restoring prosperity, but "this committee believes that if the quantitative restrictions on the export industries of various countries are not abolished, there is no hope for the revival of international trade, let alone its development. Therefore, it specifically requests that the governments of various countries not be satisfied with the ancillary measures of the new currency law, but should conduct negotiations within the shortest possible time to comprehensively revise the current commercial policies." At this point, the Polish representative proposed that the immigration issue be included in the agenda, and the Soviet representative immediately opposed it. The committee then accepted Spinasse's suggestion and decided to insert a statement in the report, stating that the free flow of population is a necessary supplement to the free flow of goods and capital. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials announced today that the establishment of the Tripartite Monetary Agreement is due to the large-scale reorganization of various currencies in the world, so as not to cause minimal disruptions to trade. It is not surprising that the pound has now fallen to US$4.89. The spokesman also said that after the Soviet Union sold one million pounds in the New York market on September 26, the US Treasury has not attempted to intervene in the exchange rate with manpower. At present, the exchange rate has quickly returned to its original state, and all news indicates that the currency is trending towards stability. The reduction of the discount rate of the Bank of France today shows that the credibility of the European financial community has been restored. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government officials announced today that Britain and the United States are now cooperating under the Anglo-French-American Monetary Agreement. Before the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reaches a stable ratio, there will inevitably be some fluctuations, but it will not cause another split between the currencies of the two countries. The implementation of the Tripartite Monetary Agreement has been very satisfactory. The currencies of all countries in the world will soon be adjusted to achieve an appropriate parity. After the national currencies are stabilized, international trade can flow freely without causing disputes. (National Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A government spokesman officially stated today that there is no currency competition between Britain and the United States, and refuted reports that Britain intends to lower the value of the gold pound. Treasury officials believe that currency adjustments will be implemented soon, and international disputes will be reduced. According to senior government officials, the future parity of the currencies of all countries in the world will only be known in the future, but the exchange rate has quickly returned to normal. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources believe that Italy may join the Anglo-American-French Monetary Agreement, which is causing considerable concern among people here. According to the German Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank, Schacht, recently proposed the restoration of German colonies and the cancellation of international debts as exchange conditions for revising the value of the German Mark. If Italy joins the International Monetary Agreement, Germany will be isolated, and the above conditions will have to be reduced. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources here, Foreign Minister Ciano will visit German leader Hitler at the end of this week. The main event to be discussed may be the recent devaluation of the Italian lira. It is reported that Ciano intends to declare to the German leader that the devaluation of the Italian currency does not change Italy's policy of friendly cooperation with Germany. Ciano's trip to Berlin was officially announced yesterday. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York World Telegram today carried reliable news that Germany may soon join the world currency stabilization movement. If so, Japan will be the only commercial country that has not participated, but Japan will not obstruct the stabilization of world currencies. (National Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee on the revision of the League of Nations Covenant recently decided, by a vote of 31 to 7, to organize a committee with representatives from the member states of the Council and some member states of the League of Nations to review the proposals submitted by the member states.

<h3>French Finance: Gold Reserves of the Bank of France Increase by 7 Billion Francs</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Bank of France recently released its weekly business report yesterday, which is the first since the devaluation of the franc. The main figures of assets and liabilities are listed below:</p>
<p>Under the asset section, after re-evaluating gold and foreign currencies, the amount increased by 7,000,000,000 to reach 57,359,000,000 francs. Various current accounts increased by 394,000,000 francs, and short-term loans increased by 788,000,000 francs. Under the liability section, the amount of banknotes in circulation increased by 2,277,000,000 francs, and various deposits increased by 488,000,000 francs. Combining the two, the reserve ratio increased from 54.42% to 60.47%.</p>
<p>The surplus obtained by calculating gold and foreign currencies according to the maximum limit of the new purity of the franc, that is, 0.04 yuan per gram, was originally as much as 17,000,000,000 francs, of which 10,000,000,000 francs have been allocated to the exchange equalization fund, leaving only 7,000,000,000. Moreover, the operation of the equalization fund must be kept strictly confidential in order to stabilize the exchange market. The fund has inflows and outflows, but it is not known to the outside world, and it will no longer be included in the weekly report in the future. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Czech Currency Devaluation: Senate and House Pass Bill</h3>
<p>Czech Capital. The House of Representatives passed the currency devaluation bill this afternoon. However, the government's original plan stipulated that the koruna should be devalued by at least 10.6% and at most 15.98%. The House of Representatives revised it to at least 10.3% and at most 18.8%. Therefore, the maximum limit of the koruna's gold purity is set at 0.03221 grams of pure gold, and the minimum limit is set at 0.03022 grams of pure gold. If the average of this maximum and minimum value is compared with the original gold purity of the koruna before the first devaluation in 1934, it is devalued by 30%, which is roughly equal to the percentage of the French franc devaluation. When the currency bill was passed today, all parties in the government voted in favor. Tonight, the Senate will start discussing the bill passed by the House of Representatives. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Czech Capital. After the currency devaluation bill proposed by the government was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, it was sent to the Senate that evening, where Prime Minister Hodza explained it, stating briefly that the percentage of the koruna's devaluation is not more than that of other countries in Western Europe, and other countries will not retaliate. In addition, the government will take measures to prevent price increases, especially for agricultural products and goods made from domestic raw materials. It is necessary to prevent price increases, because these goods are an important factor in economic stability. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Czech Capital. After the House of Representatives passed the currency devaluation bill yesterday, allowing the koruna to be devalued, the Senate also voted to pass it. It can be implemented as soon as the government determines the devaluation rate. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Financial Measures: Implementing Price Controls</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Finance Minister Trakslau recently stated to the press that the government has decided to organize a price monitoring committee to prevent price increases. The devaluation of the currency can cause prices to rise, and in terms of the Austrian economy, price increases will inevitably have adverse effects. The government has to abandon the idea of currency devaluation, but this does not mean that Austria intends to reject the financial policies of other countries. It is hoped that the current currency adjustment policies of various countries will be sufficient to promote international trade, and Austria can also contribute to the cause of general economic recovery. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Palestinian Issue: Mediation by Four Arab Kings</h3>
<p>Jerusalem. Well-informed sources on the Arab side have stated that the Arab strike and market strike will stop within days, but terrorist activities within Palestine may continue. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem. The Arab Higher Committee today received an appeal from the four Arab kings (namely, the kings of Hejaz, Transjordan, Iraq, and Yemen) to end the strike and riots as soon as possible. The residents of Palestine are very optimistic. This peaceful phenomenon can be seen in the situation in the port of Jaffa. Currently, Arab merchants there are very busy preparing for the start of the shipping season. President Hussam, the representative of the King of Hejaz, has returned to Jerusalem from Cairo. The Hejaz Embassy and the King are communicating with each other, and they had a long meeting with the Higher Committee yesterday. At the same time, there were still serious conflicts between the British army and the Arabs. The British army received a report yesterday that more than 200 Arabs were concentrated on Mount Carmel, and immediately sent a team to suppress them. The Arabs resisted slightly and then dispersed into three groups into the mountains. The British army pursued them in the mountains. A Reuters reporter personally saw three shells exploding on the side of the mountain. Three planes flew very low, seemingly in constant contact with the enemy on the ground, dropping bombs and strafing Arabs hiding in trenches with machine guns. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem. The British army is currently searching the small mountains between Tulkarem and Nablus for the rebels who attacked British tanks patrolling the area yesterday. After the British tanks were bombarded, they returned fire with machine guns. It is now believed that a total of 15 Arabs were killed or injured in the battle. Two tanks were damaged by the bombing and were guarded overnight in the wilderness by four other tanks that rushed to the rescue. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Establishes Committee to Study Enriching the Covenant; Zheng Tianxi Elected International Judge; Gu Weijun Discusses China's Two Victories</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly held a meeting this afternoon. After electing non-permanent members of the Council, it immediately passed the proposal of the Assembly's Presidium to establish a General Committee to discuss the implementation methods and related issues of the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting this Friday. The Assembly then elected judges to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. The original German judge Su Qing of the Permanent Court of International Justice passed away last year. Chinese judge Wang Chonghui and American judge Kellogg have resigned one after another. The above three seats are now to be re-elected. According to law, they should be jointly elected by the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations. The Council has elected three people in a non-public meeting a few days ago: one is the American legal scholar Hudson, one is Zheng Tianxi, the former acting minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration of China, and one is Odegan, the representative of Turkey to the League of Nations. The results of today's Assembly election are that Hudson of the United States was elected with 48 votes, and Zheng Tianxi of China was elected with 32 votes. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly elected judges to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague today. Zheng Tianxi won a majority of 31 votes out of 53 votes. However, since the Council also nominated Turkish Otokin as a candidate, the Assembly re-elected. As a result, Zheng won a majority of 30 votes out of 51 votes. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Zheng Tianxi was born in 1884 in Guangdong. He graduated from the University of London in 1912 with a doctorate in law. From 1931 to 1934, he served as the head of the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, and then served as a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and acting minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Last year, he served as the Chinese Commissioner of the International Exhibition of Chinese Antiquities in London. He enjoys a high reputation in the international judicial and diplomatic circles. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Former US Secretary of State Stimson sent a telegram to the League of Nations today, stating that he did not want to succeed Kellogg as a judge of the International Court. The Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations immediately elected Dr. Hudson, a professor at Harvard University, to fill the position. (National News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) My representative Dr. Gu Weijun said to a reporter from the Central News Agency today that as a result of yesterday's League of Nations Assembly, China was elected as a member of the Council, and Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese candidate, was also elected as a judge of The Hague Court. All parties believe that it is unprecedented in the history of the League of Nations for a member state to achieve two major victories in one day, which is worthy of congratulation. He and his colleagues are very happy. Although this victory is the result of the efforts of the Chinese delegation, it also shows that more than 50 countries attach importance to China's international status and trust the Chinese government. After General Chiang Kai-shek recently resolved the Guangdong and Guangxi issue peacefully with the demeanor of a great politician, the national political unification has been successful, and the authority of the government has been greatly enhanced. With the leadership of Mr. Chiang, China will have unlimited progress in construction and international status in the future. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Talks: Eden Meets Blum</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum invited British Foreign Secretary Eden to lunch today. Political circles here believe that the talks between the two will focus on two things: one is to prepare for the Five-Power Conference, and the other is the Soviet Union's intervention in the issue of neutrality in the Spanish Civil War. (National Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>Monte Carlo. British Foreign Secretary Eden came here to travel after attending the League of Nations meeting in Geneva. He set off for Paris with his wife and Secretary Hankey this afternoon, and then returned to England. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Five-Power Conference: Opening is Far Away</h3>
<p>(London) The Locarno Five-Power Conference was originally scheduled to be held in London in November, but judging from the current situation, this date seems too early. According to those in charge, there are still many issues that need to be resolved through diplomatic channels before the Five-Power Conference can be held. Therefore, it may not be possible to convene a meeting in November. Before last month, French Foreign Minister Daladier presented a memorandum from the French government to British Foreign Secretary Eden in Geneva. This memorandum is a response to the note sent by Britain to the governments of France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy on September 18. Experts from the British Foreign Office are currently studying this memorandum. Before the study is completed, it is hoped that replies from Germany and Italy to the British note can be received. Those in charge also believe that before the Locarno Conference can be held, there are still the following four issues that need to be resolved through diplomatic channels: (1) It is necessary to determine the relationship between the new Locarno Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, so that Germany can understand that these two treaties are not irreconcilable. (2) It is necessary to clarify the position of Belgium, in other words, whether Belgium only wants to become a protected country, or both a protector and a protected country. (3) The issue of whether the Netherlands can participate in the new Locarno Treaty. Britain will probably oppose the Netherlands' participation, because the Netherlands did not participate in the old Locarno Treaty. (4) It is necessary to clarify the position of Italy, in other words, whether Italy is in the same position as in the old Locarno Treaty, only acting as a protector, or must also become a protector and a protected country, which may not be easily accepted by Britain, because Britain does not want to expand its obligations to European countries. In short, the Locarno Five-Power Conference can only be convened when the above issues have reached a consensus and the agenda is limited to discussing details and signing the treaty.

<h3>Neutrality Committee Discusses: Spanish Issue; Tense Atmosphere in the Meeting; Germany, Italy, and Portugal to Respond to Soviet Protest</h3>
<p>(London) The Adjusting Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War met at 11:30 this morning. Chairman Lord Plymouth, the British Foreign Office official, immediately discussed four issues: (1) The Spanish government's complaint regarding certain countries' violations of the non-intervention agreement. (2) The complaint filed by the Soviet government on the 6th of this month. (3) The note submitted by the Soviet government on the 7th of this month. (4) How to deal with various munitions that pass through the ports of countries that signed the non-intervention agreement. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Adjusting Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War met this morning. Representatives from France, Belgium, and Germany spoke in succession, and the time spent on translation was not small. When the report submitted by the Spanish representative Talvaio regarding Portugal's assistance to the Spanish rebels was discussed, the Portuguese representative, the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Oliveira, immediately threatened to withdraw from the Adjusting Committee. It was 1:15 in the afternoon, and it was announced that the meeting would be adjourned until 4:00 in the afternoon, and the note submitted by the Soviet government yesterday would be submitted for discussion again. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The international committee dealing with non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is in a very tense atmosphere today because the Soviet Union has stated that if Germany, Italy, and Portugal continue to violate the non-intervention agreement, it will withdraw from the committee. The German newspapers' attacks on the Soviet Union are all indignant, accusing the Soviet Union of deliberately slandering and reversing the facts, and of deliberately provoking the public opinion of the German people. They all believe that the Soviet government's decision is just to freely and openly intervene in Spain's internal affairs and assist the Madrid government. The French newspapers' comments say that it is probably impossible to avoid Madrid falling into the hands of the rebels. The Paris Echo reports that Germany, Italy, and Portugal are willing to increase assistance to overthrow the militias organized by workers. If countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Britain can maintain calm, Europe will not be disturbed, and the function of the non-intervention agreement will not be destroyed. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Soviet Union's anger at the Western countries' assistance to the Spanish rebels has plunged Europe into a serious crisis today. Yesterday, the Soviet Union issued a warning to the countries concerned that if the external forces assisting the rebels do not stop, the Soviet Union will assist the Spanish government. Today, the Soviet Union issued a second protest, directly accusing Portugal of violating the neutrality agreement, and requesting the organization of a neutral investigation team to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the border between Spain and Portugal, and requesting that the committee be stationed there permanently, with several committee members monitoring to prevent the recurrence of events that violate the agreement. Diplomatic circles in Geneva reported today that if the fascist countries' assistance to the Spanish rebels does not stop immediately, the Soviet Union will rush aircraft and other war supplies to the Madrid government, which would be equivalent to directly challenging Germany and Italy, thus causing a situation that European politicians are unwilling to deal with. Tomorrow, representatives of the 27 countries of the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee will meet in the Locarno Room of the Foreign Office here to discuss the Soviet protest. There will be fierce debates at that time. Britain will probably speak first, using the recent accusations by the Madrid government against Germany and Italy as a topic, so as to slightly reduce the strength of the Soviet Union's intimidation. However, the Soviet Union seems to have decided today to demand an immediate decision. If the action of assisting the rebels cannot be stopped, the Soviet Union will assist the Madrid government. If the Soviet Union insists on directly assisting the Spanish government forces, a serious dispute will occur between European countries. Germany and Italy will participate directly, and French Prime Minister Blum may also find it difficult to continue his neutral policy. The Italian representative attending the Non-Intervention Agreement meeting said today that the Soviet Union's intimidation is a bluff, because it has already admitted the failure of the Madrid government. The German representative declined to make any comments and waited for the result of tomorrow's meeting. (National Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>Powerful Movement Brewing in the Labor Party of the Contributing Nations</h3>
<p>(London) Representatives at the Labor Party Congress are currently brewing a powerful movement to demand an early recall of Parliament. The situation in Spain has become increasingly serious due to the attitude of Soviet Russia. Labor leaders Attlee and Greenwood have already consulted with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. Furthermore, a demand is being initiated, led by the prominent Labor Party leader and Member of Parliament, Sir Stafford Cripps, to pressure the government to lift the ban on arms exports in order to aid the Spanish government. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Edinburgh - At the opposition Labor Party Congress, a resolution put forward by the party's Executive Committee was unanimously passed today. The resolution advocates that the British and French governments should immediately rescind the arms embargo imposed on the Spanish government. The resolution also incorporated a suggestion proposed by the party's extremist Member of Parliament, Sir Stafford Cripps, stating that the Labor Party Congress firmly believes that fascist countries have violated the obligations stipulated in the non-intervention agreement. Earlier, the Labor Party Executive Committee held a meeting last night, during which the leader of the Labor Party parliamentary group, Major Attlee, and the leader of the Trades Union Congress, Greenwood, reported on their meeting with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. Subsequently, a resolution was passed stating that if foreign aid to the Spanish rebels is confirmed, the British and French governments should immediately rescind the arms embargo on the Spanish government. As for the method of proof, an immediate investigation should be conducted and the findings made public, so that the Spanish government can purchase the necessary arms to maintain constitutional politics and restore order. In addition, the Labor Party Congress should immediately convene a national labor conference to seek approval for this policy. As for the draft resolution proposed by Mr. Liddell, Chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, at today's congress, calling for all political groups nationwide that support the labor class to form a unified organization to expand their strength, it was rejected by the congress by a majority of 1,805,000 votes to 435,000 votes.

<h3>Soviet Teachers Donate Part of Their Salaries</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Teachers in the city's schools held a city-wide congress yesterday to discuss the situation in Spain. They resolved to donate part of their monthly salaries to a fund to aid the women and children of that country. The teachers present also reported that children in most schools had held meetings and enthusiastically discussed the situation in Spain. Construction workers here also held a city-wide congress and resolved to sympathize with the Spanish people and continuously donate funds to aid the families of the soldiers of the Spanish Republic.

<h3>Japan-Russia Oil Agreement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations between Japan and Russia regarding the extension of the test drilling rights for the North Sakhalin petroleum mine for five years were recently concluded. It is scheduled to be formally signed on the 10th by President Chikashi of the Japanese Sakhalin Oil Company and Commissioner Orsenyky of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Heavy Industry in Moscow. As a result of this agreement, the North Sakhalin Oil Company has newly obtained test drilling rights in four regions and re-obtained test drilling rights in three regions in the south. It will also improve the treatment of Soviet service personnel. It is reported that after President Chikashi of the company returns to Japan from Moscow, he will formulate a concrete plan for a new business, aiming to produce 500,000 tons of petroleum annually after five years.

<h3>Spanish War: Two Cities Near the Capital Fall; Curfew Imposed in the Capital</h3>
<p>(London) According to a dispatch from Reuters correspondent on the Spanish front, after the capture of Navalpilar and Escalonilla, and reports of the fall of San Martín de Valdeiglesias, the rebel forces in Toledo and Avila have been able to unite. Furthermore, news received here today states that the Moroccan army, after intense shelling and air raids, has occupied the strategic pass of Navalpilar and is preparing to advance. It is widely believed that the capture of Escalonilla will leave 3,000 government troops with no way to retreat to the capital. No government aircraft have been seen in the sky for days, and rumors are circulating that the pilots have mutinied and refuse to fight. General Mola, commander of the rebel forces in the north, claims that 200 bodies of government militiamen have been found on the Seguntia front. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Valladolid - According to rebel radio broadcasts received here today, the rebel forces claim to have captured the town of Sigüenza, located 50 miles northeast of Madrid. If this is true, Madrid is now left with only one transportation line, namely the railway line from Madrid to Alicante, which the rebels also claim to have destroyed in Aranjuez. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The two strategic passes of Navalpilar, 25 miles northwest of Madrid, and Escalonilla, 40 miles northeast, both fell last night. As a result, the rebel siege of Madrid is now even closer to the city. After three days of intense fighting, the rebel forces finally managed to occupy Navalpilar, thanks to their superior air force. The government troops have now retreated to Las Navas. The fall of Navalpilar is tantamount to opening a major road from El Escorial to Madrid, but the government still intends to defend the area. The capture of Escalonilla is also attributed to the troops of General Varelas, who previously rescued the Alcázar of Toledo. At the same time, fierce street fighting has broken out in Oviedo in northern Spain. Asturian miners have used bombs to break into the town. The strategically located prison has now been completely surrounded, and the rebel forces have been forced to retreat to the center of the town. Government troops are now attacking the arsenal, where the rebel forces have built strong trenches. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Although the city of Oviedo has been occupied by government troops, street fighting continues within the city. The city's radio station is now in the hands of government troops. Government troops are also continuing to press the rebel forces on the Navalperal front. It is likely that the final battle for the rebel forces to seize Madrid will take place there. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The Ministry of War today informed the Associated Press that from tomorrow, traffic will be cut off and lights extinguished in the capital after 11 p.m. every night. 12,000 children in the capital will be evacuated to the Mediterranean coast, and adults are also free to leave the city at will. It is generally believed that government leaders anticipate that the rebel forces will soon advance and besiege the capital, hence these preparations. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid - An emergency National Defense Committee has been established today, and all military and political power is concentrated in this committee. Its first action is to order one million young men of all ranks to enlist in the army and fight. The rebel plan to besiege the city has been completed, with a diameter of 40 miles, and an attack can be launched at any time. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Party Strife in France: Right-Wing Organizations Raided</h3>
<p>(Paris) Police today suddenly searched the headquarters of the French Social Party and the residences of more than 20 fascist leaders. Weapons manufactured in Germany were found in the home of Mr. Rocque, the former leader of the Croix-de-Feu, including a sharp blade with a swastika mark. In addition, there were many photographs, manuscripts, and documents. The documents found in the headquarters of the French Social Party are likely to prove that the party is actually an illegal revival of the Croix-de-Feu. It is reported that Mr. Rocque had previously issued a strong declaration, stating that he would disrupt any meeting of left-wing parties. Therefore, the government has taken the offensive, organizing a special search team of 1,500 police officers to conduct a surprise search. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Croix-de-Feu, organized by French fascist leader La Rocque, has reorganized into the Social Problems Research Party and continues its activities after being dissolved by the government. Today, the police searched the various organizations of the party, totaling 37 locations. La Rocque's two residences in Paris and Versailles were also searched, resulting in the seizure of a large number of documents, three clubs, five canes, one pistol, and one bayonet. The residence of Mr. Mermoz, a famous aviator and member of the party's central executive committee, was also searched. Examining Magistrate Béteille has now been ordered to collect various materials regarding the Social Problems Research Party and handle the case concurrently. It is reported that La Rocque and his assistants will be notified within days, pointing out that La Rocque and others have two suspected crimes: (1) conspiring to reorganize the Croix-de-Feu, which was dissolved in July; (2) organizing a counter-demonstration during the Communist Party's demonstration in the Prince's Park last Sunday, causing a disturbance. As for La Rocque himself, he protested against the court's measures, saying, "No matter what the outcome, I will still order all party members to continue their activities. These international trade union dogs want to prohibit our actions. I will tell them, 'Don't even think about it.' Know that even if I die, I will not yield. Even after my death, the movement for national revival will never stop." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Right-Wing Parties Decide on Common Platform</h3>
<p>Brussels - Mr. Degrelle, leader of the fascist Rexist Party, and Mr. Cloek, leader of the Flemish National Union, held a meeting yesterday and decided on a common platform. One of the most important goals is to separate Flanders, where the Flemish people live, from the Walloon region, where the Walloon people live. Regarding this, the "Flemish National Union Newspaper" recently stated that the parties have decided to establish a strong government under the form of a professional association system, "so that Belgium will not be dragged into the vortex of war." The "Free Belgian Newspaper" and "Evening News" stated that the agreement reached by the parties does not endanger the monarchy or the unified system, but aims to adopt a decentralized system in administration and separate Flanders and Wallonia in terms of language. At the same time, Flemish and Walloon languages should be used in the city of Brussels. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Reports Another Plot to Assassinate Stalin</h3>

<h3>Record of the International General Assembly of the League of Nations Union: Our Country's Representative Gives a Somber Speech on Sino-Japanese Relations; The Assembly Asks All Countries to Respect China's Sovereignty and Territory</h3>
<p>London Correspondence: The 20th International General Assembly of the League of Nations Union was held in Glasgow, England, from June 1st to 4th of this year. Our side's representatives were initially appointed by the Board of Directors of the Chinese League of Nations Union as Mr. Wang Jingchun and Mr. Tang Liangli. Later, considering that the 18th General Assembly was convened in England two years ago and was represented by Mr. Liu Kai, First Secretary of the British Embassy, for the sake of experienced personnel, Representative Wang cabled the Nanjing Board of Directors to add Mr. Liu to attend. In addition to the two members, Mr. Jian Shou Xuan and Mr. Wang Haijing, selected by our country's Geneva branch to help attend, Mr. You Jianwen and Mr. Wang Keqin were also temporarily invited to assist the delegation's affairs. Therefore, the number of attendees on our side at this session was quite considerable. The work of the conference was divided into four groups, and committees held discussions simultaneously. Our representatives participated in each of them. The following is a summary of the issues related to our country and those of greater importance, as resolved:</p>
<p>The Dispute Between Italy and Abyssinia</p>
<p>This case was first raised for discussion by the British Union as an emergency motion. At that time, the Abyssinian resistance was collapsing, and representatives from various countries had divergent views on whether the economic system should continue. Some even said that since the Abyssininian king had already fled, the opportunity had been lost and there was no way to save it. The debate was extremely fierce. Our representative spoke, stating that the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia and the future of the Sino-Japanese incident were closely related and had a close impact. In the former case of the change in East Asia, it was said to be "too far" and no assistance was provided. Today, in the dispute between Abyssinia and Italy, it is said to be "too late" and sanctions are terminated. It is important to know that cause and effect follow each other. Yesterday, China was invaded. Today, Abyssinia is attacked. I am afraid that tomorrow, I do not know what country will be struck by misfortune. Today's situation in Italy and Abyssinia, if it is not resolved according to law and justice, will cause the League of Nations to lose its credibility and plunge European and world peace into a desperate situation. It was well received by the audience, and the atmosphere of the meeting was also changed. After two days of debate, a resolution was passed stating that the current sanctions should continue to be maintained and, if necessary, should be increased. National Unions should work hard to promote discourse in order to restore the rule of international law.</p>
<p>Improving the League of Nations</p>
<p>This case was first proposed by the representative from this country, Mr. Rolland (the chairman of this General Assembly), after committee debate the case was handed over to the draft group for completion (Representative Wang Jingchun was also chosen as a draft committee member). The final result was to notify the resolution, the main points of which are as follows: (A) The goal of collective security is not only to stop acts of aggression, but should also pay attention to preventing the occurrence of such acts. This depends on the practical application of Articles 11 and 16 of the Covenant. (B) Effective methods should be adopted to ensure the fulfillment of international obligations, and the rights of minorities should be emphasized. (C) Member states should use Article 19 of the Covenant to peacefully amend international treaties. (D) The manufacture of armaments should be under international control and should not be for private profit.</p>
<p>The Japanese Aggression Case</p>
<p>The case of Japan's aggression against China's independence and territorial integrity was proposed by the French Union. (Although the Japanese League of Nations Union did not send representatives to attend this session, it had prepared a written opinion on this case, which was sent to the Secretariat of the General Assembly for distribution to the representatives.) The British representative initially stated that the wording of the case did not fully correspond to the current actual situation, such as requesting the League of Nations to discuss this matter at the next Executive Council meeting, and the procedures were not appropriate. Therefore, they first exchanged views with our side. After our side explained in detail, the British side agreed to support it in principle. Our side then, based on the proposal submitted by our country's Union's Board of Directors, drafted an amendment, adding sections on smuggling, troop increases, the sale of narcotics, and the conspiracy to seize five provinces in North China. Our representative also gave a somber speech, and after debate, a resolution was passed, first recounting Japan's illegal acts, and concluding that "Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, since China is a member of the League of Nations, Japan's hostile attitude towards it is sufficient to invoke the current provisions of Article 17 of the Covenant. The League of Nations continues to have special difficulties in dealing with the Far East situation, but member states of the League of Nations should not continue to maintain normal international relations with the aggressor country, nor should they sit idly by and watch the destruction of the Covenant. This is the hope of this General Assembly that the League of Nations will recognize the issue of Japanese aggression against China at the next Executive Council meeting, and hopes that national unions will work hard to urge their respective governments to adopt common methods in Geneva to bring this state of affairs that violates the fundamental principles of the League of Nations to an end in order to protect the independent rights of mankind and to maintain world peace."</p>
<p>Banning Film Depictions of Cruelty</p>
<p>The British Union raised a case regarding the depiction of cruel acts in films, stating that such cruel depictions have an adverse impact on the psychology of the audience, and proposed that the General Assembly's Education Committee study methods to ban them. During the first reading of this case, our representative did not participate in the comments due to attention to political issues, but when it was submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, our representative spoke in support, while stating that film depictions of other countries' customs and human relations often tend to be bizarre and lead to bad impressions, which is enough to foster misunderstandings and prejudices between races. A special amendment was proposed, adding the item "sufficient to cause ill will between races." After debate, our side's opinion was adopted. Regarding this case and our side's amendment, the British Labor Party newspaper, "The Daily Herald," and other newspapers had special reports.</p>
<p>Relief for Refugees</p>
<p>When the two cases of relief for refugees and trafficking in women were submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, our representative spoke to explain our situation, stating that the number of refugees in our country who have fallen into China is very large, but most of them live in the northeastern provinces and various concessions, so they are temporarily not under the direct jurisdiction of China. However, within the scope of possibility, the Chinese government does its best to protect them. As for the case of trafficking in women in the Far East, it is said that the Far East Conference proposed by the League of Nations is limited to the governments of the Far East. The Chinese law is extremely strict in cracking down on the trafficking of people, but because the ships and related ports such as Hong Kong are not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese authorities, many difficulties actually arise. All rely on the close cooperation of Chinese and foreign authorities. According to the 1932 League of Nations Eastern Women's Trafficking Investigation Team report, it was pointed out that almost all of the Western women trafficked to China were concentrated in the concessions and treaty ports where foreigners lived, and almost all of the Chinese women trafficked abroad were scattered in the colonies of the South Seas Islands. Therefore, the Far East Conference referred to in this case is not limited to the governments of the Far East, and the governments of the respective colonies should also pay special attention in order to achieve the greatest effect. The General Assembly unanimously approved that a note should be attached to this case, hoping that other relevant governments would participate in the conference.</p>
<p>Report by Our Representative</p>
<p>According to the General Assembly's regulations, at the beginning of each day's General Assembly, representatives from various countries give brief speeches to the General Assembly, reporting on their work over the past year. Our report was based on the draft prepared by the Board of Directors and slightly modified according to the situation at the time. It stated that our country's Union has a long history, and although the number of members is relatively small, many of its members are leaders from all walks of life, so it has great power in advocating discourse. At a time when the League of Nations' credibility is being greatly undermined, our country's comrades' belief in the League of Nations' doctrine has never wavered, and they have redoubled their efforts to save the situation. Therefore, since the reorganization last year, the number of members has increased sharply, and the Union's affairs have also developed daily. Finally, it was said that our country's comrades very much hope that the General Assembly's annual meeting will be convened in Asia soon, so that East-West cooperation can be closer and can better show the universality of the League of Nations' organization. (According to our country's Board of Directors, it originally intended to propose that the next annual meeting be held in Asia, but because it was overdue and inconvenient to formally propose it, it expressed its invitation in the speech, which was very welcome by the representatives of the General Assembly. At that time, the Manchester Guardian reported and praised our side's report as the most noteworthy report at the meeting.) The organization and activities of the General Assembly are no different from the small model of the League of Nations General Assembly. There are also quite a few representatives from various countries who have attended the League of Nations meetings, so the discussion of various issues is no less than that of the League of Nations meetings. The resolutions passed will also be sent to the League of Nations and published in the League of Nations' official documents. In the past two or three years, our country's Union and the League of Nations General Assembly have been in increasingly close contact. If we can continue to use this international conference, it will be a good tool for our country's national diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao's Trip to Guangdong: Stresses National Unity for Survival; Expounds Four Key Buddhist Principles in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Dai Jitao, member of the Central Committee, President of the Examination Yuan, and President of the National Boy Scouts Association, recently returned to China from Europe. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 6th. Military and political figures from Guangdong Province who went to Hong Kong to welcome him included Wang Yingyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department; Li Xuhuan, representative of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters; Liu Jiwen, member of the Provincial Government; Xu Chongqing, Director of the Education Department; and dozens of representatives from various agencies. At approximately 7:00 AM that morning, the Boston ship carrying Mr. Dai slowly docked. Mr. Dai, dressed in a brown Western suit, was full of energy and stood by the ship's railing. Once the ship docked, he immediately descended the gangway, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with those welcoming him at the pier. He mentioned his decision to go abroad to attend the World Games, where he had discussed matters with German Chancellor Hitler, strengthening Sino-German relations. He believed the Chinese athletes participating in the World Games, especially the football team, would earn global praise. He also mentioned visiting Poland, Switzerland, and other places for observation, finding unique strengths in each country's politics and education. After the closing of the World Games, he returned east via Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Italy. In France, he met with Mr. Jingwei (Wang Jingwei), who was recovering well and expected to return to China next month. After this brief conversation, Mr. Dai took a car directly to Deng Yanhua's home in Kowloon Tong for a short rest. In the afternoon, he attended a tea party hosted by various Buddhist organizations in Hong Kong, and then went to Donglian Jueyuan to lecture on Buddhism, explaining the four major Buddhist principles of "generosity," "loving speech," "beneficial action," and "collaboration," ultimately leading to world peace and universal harmony. The audience was deeply moved. He left around 3:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, accompanied by Deng Yanhua, Wang Yingyu, Liu Jiwen, and others, he took a special Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Guangdong Province, arriving in Guangzhou at the Dashatou Station at 7:50 PM. Over a hundred people welcomed him, including Chen Cheng, Huang Musong, Xiang Hanping, Yu Hanmou, and members of the Provincial Government, Municipal Government, and representatives of the people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. That evening, the local authorities hosted a banquet at the Municipal Guest House to welcome Mr. Dai, with military, political, party, and academic officials in attendance. During the banquet, Mr. Dai emphasized the necessity of national unity and sincerity, asserting that only then could China survive in the present world. He noted that China possessed superior geographical and temporal advantages, and that with human unity, national revival could be expected. The banquet was filled with cheerful toasts and camaraderie. That night, President Dai stayed at Liu Jiwen's residence in Meihua Village. At approximately 7:00 AM on the 7th, Huang Musong, Wang Yingyu, Xiao Jishan, and others paid their respects. After breakfast, Mr. Dai and Liu Jiwen visited the Provincial Government and the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, returning greetings to Huang Musong and Yu Hanmou. At around 9:00 AM, they drove to the Huanghuagang to pay respects to the seventy-two martyrs, and then visited Hu Hanmin's tomb in Longyandong. On the way back, he personally visited Hu Hanmin's residence to comfort his widow, Chen Shuzi, and his daughter, Mulan. At 11:00 AM, Dai returned to Huangpodong Zhongda Linchang to revisit old haunts. There, he saw the Mingzhu Building, built when Dai was the president of Zhongshan University. The building was clean, with an inscription by Dai. Surrounded by lush forests and a clear pond in the cave, he lingered for a long time before returning to the Municipal Guest House for a luncheon at the Provincial Government. In the afternoon, he met with veteran comrades and subordinates in Guangdong. If the weather was clear on the 8th, he would take a plane directly from Guangzhou to Guling to return to Nanjing.

<h3>Spread of Malignant Malaria in Jiangsu Province: Epidemic Across Jiangnan and Jiangbei; Zhenjiang, Jurong, Jintan, Tongzhou, Rugao, Gaoyou, and Bao County Most Severely Affected; Total Affected Population Expected to Reach Approximately One Million; Provincial Department and Health Authorities Actively Preventing and Controlling the Epidemic</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication: Since the beginning of autumn, a severe epidemic of malignant malaria has broken out in counties both north and south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. Recently, the epidemic has been particularly severe in Jiangnan areas such as Zhenjiang, Jurong, Yizheng, Jintan, Danyang, Gaochun, and Wujin counties, and in Jiangbei areas such as Tongzhou, Rugao, Gaoyou, and Bao counties, with the rural areas being especially hard hit. The average number of people affected in each county is over 50,000 to 60,000, and the mortality rate is also quite high. It is estimated that the total number of people affected in these counties will reach approximately one million. The epidemic is also gradually being discovered in other counties. The provincial department and health authorities are planning active prevention and control measures. The following is a summary of the information obtained from the investigation:</p>
<p>Causes of Malaria</p>
<p>According to medical experts, the cause of malignant malaria is undoubtedly the transmission by malaria mosquitoes. Mosquitoes thrive best at temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees. Excessive heat and dryness can inhibit mosquito breeding. This summer, the climate was mostly humid and lacked high temperatures, rarely reaching above 90 degrees. After the beginning of autumn, there was a drought, and although the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, the temperature remained between 70 and 80 degrees. Therefore, the number of mosquitoes this year was greater than in the past, and they did not decrease even in late autumn. In remote and unsanitary areas, malignant malaria has arisen as a result. Local people often regard malaria as an insignificant illness (commonly called "peaceful illness") and ignore it, thus the affected area gradually expands. Little do they know that this malignant malaria is not only easily transmitted but can also be fatal.</p>
<p>Symptoms of the Epidemic</p>
<p>According to general investigations, those affected by this epidemic initially experience chills and shivering, followed by high fever without sweating, or fever followed by sweating but not much. They also experience headaches and brain swelling, similar to typhoid fever and meningitis. The condition fluctuates in severity from day to day, the fever does not subside completely, the tongue coating is white and greasy, the appetite decreases, the complexion is yellow and dull, and there are occasional vomiting and diarrhea, or spots appear all over the body. If they receive malaria injections or take quinine pills or cinchona bark within four or five days, there may be no danger, otherwise it is dangerous and incurable and is easily transmitted. If the patient is not isolated and eating utensils are not properly separated, it often happens that several members of the same family contract the disease.</p>
<p>Extent of the Spread</p>
<p>This epidemic is spreading very severely. A small number of cases were discovered after the beginning of autumn, but recently, Zhenjiang, Jurong, Yizheng, Jintan, Danyang, Gaochun, Nantong, and Rugao counties have reported to the province and requested relief. In other counties such as Wujin, Jiangyin, Jiading, Gaoyou, and Baoying, the epidemic is also quite severe. In Jiangnan, Jurong and Zhenjiang counties are the most severely affected. In the second district of Jurong, more than 50,000 people have already contracted the disease. In Zhenjiang, it is estimated that more than 3,000 people have contracted the disease, with the rural areas being particularly hard hit. Deaths are occurring one after another in Dongmatou and Xinfeng in Dantu. Doctors are overwhelmed, and coffins and medicines are sold out. In Jiangbei, the epidemic is most severe in Tongzhou and Rugao. In Rugao County alone, the total number of people affected is more than 50,000, and the number of deaths has reached more than 5,000. According to Baojia investigations, at least half of the households within each Jia are affected by the disease, and more than 30 people die in each Bao. There are not enough doctors to go around, and business is extremely busy. Those who get sick and seek medical attention often have to wait two or three days for a doctor to arrive. Therefore, many people die without receiving treatment. Coffins are sold out. Other businesses, such as Chinese and Western pharmacies and grocery and used clothing stores, are open until dawn, with busy transactions and insufficient goods, a sight never seen before. It is currently the autumn harvest season, but in the epidemic areas, no one is harvesting the cotton and rice, leaving them to lie waste in the fields. The four villages have become a world of terror.</p>
<p>Estimated Deaths</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this epidemic, most cases have occurred in rural areas, and few people have paid attention. Most of those affected are rural farmers. Transportation is inconvenient, making it impossible to seek medical attention, and they lack basic health knowledge, regarding this disease as an ordinary illness and not paying attention to it. Moreover, due to the economic bankruptcy of the rural areas, most people cannot afford medical treatment. Therefore, countless patients die one after another. On average, one person dies for every twenty people affected, which means that the mortality rate is around 40,000 to 50,000 people. Most of the deaths are among the hardworking and poor, and most of the deaths occur in rural areas. Most tragically, there are cases where several members of the same family die, and there is no one to make coffins or carry the bodies, making burial impossible. This is indeed the case.</p>
<p>Prevention and Control Efforts</p>
<p>After receiving reports from various counties, the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department recently notified the counties to quickly unite with local health agencies and physicians to organize epidemic prevention teams, purchase malaria treatment drugs, and distribute them to various rural areas for treatment. They also ordered them to promote malaria prevention knowledge to the public. Currently, epidemic prevention teams in Zhenjiang, Danyang, Nantong, Rugao, and other places have been successfully organized and have set off for treatment. The National Economic Commission's Health Experimental Zone has allocated 200,000 quinine pills to Jiangsu Province, and the Civil Affairs Department has sent personnel to Nanjing to collect them for distribution to the affected counties. The Provincial Hospital has also sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of medicines for reserve. It is said that preventing and controlling this type of epidemic is not as difficult as dealing with acute infectious diseases. If sufficient medical supplies can be provided, if those affected can actively seek treatment, and if the climate can return to normal, then this terrible epidemic of malignant malaria can be eradicated in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Fire Kills Four</h3>
<p>At the Ma Fuxing Secondhand Goods Store (separated by a wall from the store), opened by Ma Jinfu, opposite the Wang Yongshun Lumber Store on the main street east of the Wannian Bridge outside Xumen, a fire suddenly broke out carelessly at 3:30 AM on the 9th. Because it was piled with old clothes and cotton batting, which are flammable materials, it burst into flames in an instant and could not be contained. There were five partners in the workplace at the time. Because the house was built against the city wall and had no back door, when the fire raged, the front door had already been burned. Except for two partners who escaped the fire by climbing onto the roof, three others perished in the flames. However, the partners who escaped suffered serious injuries, one of whom died in the morning. Another is currently receiving treatment and is in critical condition. In this incident, five partners of the entire store were burned to death, which can be described as a disaster. By 3:00 PM, only one corpse had been unearthed in the fire field. Two other bodies have not yet been found. The two corpses that had been dug up and escaped the fire have been inspected by the court, and the remaining two corpses will be reported for inspection after they have been exhumed. It is reported that the store suffered a loss of at least 6,000 yuan due to the fire, but it was not insured.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Lake Bandits Rob Fishing Boat in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Wang Changsheng, from Zhoutieqiao, Yixian County, is 45 years old. He is a fishmonger by trade and has a small boat loaded with fish and shrimp. On the 7th of this month, Wang purchased more than 150 catties of fresh shrimp from Daihe's fish shop in Shatanggang. At about 5:00 PM, he started sailing to Wuxi. When the boat passed the lake near Yatoushan, Diantouzhu in the county, it was suddenly met by a bandit boat. Eight bandits jumped out, wearing gray, tattered military uniforms, speaking with a Hubei accent, carrying eight rifles and one pistol, and ordered the boat to stop. Wang Changsheng had no choice but to stop the boat. The bandits boarded the boat and forced him to tell them where he had hidden the silver. Changsheng replied slowly and was pushed into the lake. Fortunately, he was a good swimmer and was not killed. Changsheng's wife and daughter were also driven ashore. The small boat and all the belongings were robbed. Now Changsheng's family has lost their home and had to walk back to Yixing. The situation is pitiable.</p>
<h3>Great Fire Destroys Thirty Households</h3>
<p>Wu Weijun, a resident of No. 1 Gaoyangli, Taiping Lane, outside Guangfu Gate, from Zhenjiang, runs the Caizhi Zhai and Yihe Fuji Teahouses in Wuxi. At about 11:00 PM on the 8th, a fire broke out in his house due to the baking of cakes and pastries, leaving a fire on the wood chips. Before long, it broke through the roof, and the fire was fierce, spreading to the neighbors on the left and right. When the fire brigades of each section heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour, it was extinguished. In total, the homes of Wu Weijun, Pu Laoyun, Sun Baoqing, Gai Ashun, Yan Jinlang, Hua Kunming, Su Huanmei, He Asan, Yu Wenhua, Gao Ronggui, Chen Fuchu, Fei Tongjun, Wang Rongbao, Wang Zilin, Zhu Songcun, Wu Arong, Shen Dajin, Wu Sanda, Fan Zengfu, Yu Youliang, Lu Tianyi, Wang Chenshi and more than 30 other households were burned, resulting in huge losses. Also, Hua Wenan's home in Dangko Town, District 8, was also burned a few days ago due to carelessness, burning hundreds of jars of Shaoxing wine, as well as clothing and jewelry, worth more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Capture of Robbery Bandits</h3>
<p>The Tugao Bank in Jintan County was robbed last month. Afterwards, the Central Superintendent of the county ordered Captain Sun of the Detective Team to solve the case within a time limit. After receiving the order, Sun went out to investigate and arrested Liu Dayouzi, a suspect, who confessed that Wang, a bandit from Kuzhu, Zhenjiang County, Li Xiaosizi, Ding Baoyu, Tao Yuan, and others were hiding in Xishantou, at the junction of Zhenjiang and Danyang. After receiving the confession, Sun immediately took four detectives to Danyang to meet with Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau. Together with local detectives Tiao Xiang and others, they went to arrest them. When the bandits Li and others saw that things were not good, they tried to escape. The officers then fired their guns and ordered them to stop, and they were all captured. They also searched the bandit's den and seized a rifle, a Type 38 rifle, a rifle, 83 bullets, and many pieces of clothing. Together with the bandits, they were taken to the Public Security Bureau in the city for temporary detention. Captain Sun of the Jintan County Detective Team planned to escort the bandits to Jintan that night. Director Zhang was afraid that the bandits Li and others had committed robbery cases in this county, so he waited for interrogation before issuing orders.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Unscrupulous Merchants Export Rice</h3>
<p>Now, at the most critical time of national crisis, with foreign powers pressing us, unscrupulous merchants have purchased 3,000 shi of rice in the north and transported it to Huangqiao, Taixing, north of the Yangtze River, and then transported it to Haizhou by Lusixian for export. It is sold to a certain party for military rations, causing rice prices to skyrocket and sources to become scarce, which has a significant impact on the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Good Autumn Cocoon Production</h3>
<p>This year, villagers in various villages raised many autumn silkworms. A total of 32 cocoon firms opened. The county produced a total of 4,000 dan of fresh cocoons. The sericulture improvement area collected 24,000 yuan in improvement fees. The local Education Bureau will be ordered to merge school districts to comply with regulations. There are more than 200 schools in the county, divided into five school districts, which seems too many based on the number of schools. Therefore, it is planned to merge them into four school districts according to the administrative districts, with every two administrative districts merged into one school district for convenience. The plan has been submitted to the provincial authorities for approval. The bureau has decided that the director will personally work with the two supervisors to replan it. Furthermore, the provincial authorities have ordered the short-term primary schools to be closed. The bureau has ordered all schools to quickly organize graduation ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Widening of Central Street</h3>
<p>The streets of the county town are extremely narrow and untidy. Now, in order to tidy up the city, the county government plans to open a central road to facilitate traffic. The route is from the south gate of the city, through South Gate Street, South County, West County, City Center, Siqian Street, and Shuyuan Lane, to the north gate. The whole width will be expanded to eight meters. The central piles have now been measured, and the city houses on both sides have been transferred. The project is now determined to start the construction of the South Gate City, South Gate Street, and South County Street first. When the whole road is completed in the future, cars can go directly from the Xihu Road to the scenic area of Beiguo at the South Gate.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Fully Connected</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Caoe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is more than 80 kilometers long. All earthwork, stonework, and bridge projects have been contracted out. Construction was originally scheduled to start on October 1, but in response to the request of farmers along the route, the Railway Ministry approved the start of construction on October 21, and set a deadline for harvesting rice and paid land compensation. The Cao'e River Bridge will begin construction on the 15th. The Xiaoshan-Jingjiang line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will be built by the Hangzhou-Caoe section. The Hangzhou City Station will be built as a joint station for the Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, and land will be requisitioned. Double tracks will be laid from Hangzhou to Zhakou, and two branch lines will be built between Nanxing Bridge and Zhakou, one using the old line and the other passing through Bagua Tian, Wuzi Ridge, and Xiaotianzhu Meinv Mountain, connecting to the Qiantang River Bridge. The connection of the Hangzhou-Ningbo line is currently underway with the opening of mountains and the filling of earth.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Fire in Ximen Shangshu Street</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Knitting Factory at No. 116 Shangshu Street, Ximen, Ningbo, was recently established by Chen Qida, a native of Ningbo, with a total capital of 2,000 yuan. He moved into the house at the end of last month and insured for 4,000 yuan against fire with the American Asian Bank. The 7th was the opening date of the factory, and a banquet was prepared to invite guests. At night, after the banquet was over, everyone returned home to sleep. Only the accountant Li Changsheng and the ironing worker Zhou Shunji and others were left in the factory. At about 1:00 AM on the 8th, a fire suddenly broke out, and the roof was soon pierced. All the houses and property were destroyed in the fire, with losses of more than 5,000 yuan. Fortunately, the various Yilong fire brigades heard the alarm and made every effort to rescue the neighbors, and the neighbors were not affected.</p>
<h3>Lishui: Fujian Bandits Invade Xuanping County</h3>
<p>More than 160 bandits of the Liu Ying unit from Fujian, with 100 guns, sneaked into Xuanping County Town on the 7th at 10:00 PM via the border between Pucheng, Longquan, and Songyang, taking different routes in the dark. The garrison in the county fought back hastily, opening fire for two hours. The bandits were unable to hold out and retreated to Tangshan in the northwest. The government troops are advancing to pursue them and are rapidly mobilizing large forces to encircle them. Local order is gradually being restored, but there have been considerable losses. Xu Chongwu, the administrative inspector of the Lishui district, was promoted to the province for public affairs. After the report, he set off to return on the 9th to instruct on handling local relief.</p>

<h3>National Boy Scouts to Hold Review Ceremony This Morning; Second Pre-Review Yesterday; He Yingqin Gives Instructions; Boy Scouts Continuing to Arrive, Now Reaching Thirty Units</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) The second National Boy Scout Grand Review and Grand Jamboree held its second pre-review yesterday. The review ceremony will be held this morning. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Second Review Rehearsal: The Boy Scout Grand Review will hold its second review rehearsal on the morning of the 9th. Vice President He will serve as the Chief Review Officer, and Liu Yongyao will be the Commander-in-Chief. (Su) Song Jingqi, (Zhe) Zhu Chengfu, (Jing) Yang Pinji, (Hu) Sun Fuxin, (Wan) Xu Kangmin, (Gan) Li Daoming, and (Lu) Zhang Jiyao will serve as the district commanders. Chief Gui Yongqing will correct the Boy Scouts' posture wherever he goes. During the review, Vice President He gave a speech on China's crisis and current situation, divided into three points: 1. China's crisis is not due to the inferiority of guns and cannons, but to the weakness of the people's patriotic sincerity. 2. China's current situation has been unified and is on a hopeful path. 3. China's industry is now able to manufacture its own aircraft, artillery, and shells, which is a significant improvement over the past. I can responsibly say that China is now very safe. He also said that China is able to make such progress because someone is directing it from behind. Who is that director? The Boy Scouts shouted in unison: It is our Chairman Chiang! Vice President He, etc., said: Since it is Chairman Chiang, we should wholeheartedly support the leader.</p>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Drill: At 2:00 PM, an anti-aircraft drill was held at the Grand Training Ground of the General Training Team. The Chief Commander, Vice Commander Liu Yongyao, Chief of Staff Yan Wu, and many members of the Anti-Aircraft Drill Committee attended. More than 19,000 guests and visitors attended. First, more than 20 tanks circled the field several times, followed by aircraft with air machine guns. The aircraft appeared from the north of the training ground, arriving in 84 aircraft in total. Three of them were training aircraft, distributing leaflets and performing various poses. Then, four anti-aircraft guns fired in unison. Although they were blank rounds, they contained gunpowder and produced loud noises and flashes of light. The aircraft circled and danced, attacking each other with the tanks and anti-aircraft guns. The atmosphere was extremely tense, and the spectators were shocked. The 84 aircraft formed a line, a cross, and various rotations in front, behind, left, and right, lasting for one and a half hours.</p>
<p>Police Fire Department Performance: The police fire department then gave a fire fighting performance. It was open to the public in the afternoon, and thousands of schools, organizations, and groups from the capital and other places went to visit.</p>
<p>Night Camp Anti-Aircraft: A camp anti-aircraft drill was held from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM.

<h3>Male and Female Boy Scouts Extremely Diligent in Labor Service; Male Scouts Perform Decency and Cleanliness Movement; Female Scouts Perform Rural Hygiene Movement</h3>
<p>The Boy Scouts' labor service in Nanjing, held on the afternoon of the 8th, was described in yesterday's newspaper. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Male Boy Scout Labor Service, Decency and Cleanliness Movement, divided into twelve routes. Each route is assigned one hundred to several tens of people, depending on the length and distance of the street. Two Boy Scouts work at each post. Their work locations are on Guofu Road, Zhongshan Road, Zhongshan East Road, Taiping Road, Zhuque Road, Jiankang Road, Zhonghua Road, Baixia Road, Liji Lane, Ke Lane, Hongwu Road, and other places in the city. White cloth banners are hung at the entrance of each route to draw attention to the concept of decency and cleanliness. Many pedestrians who did not walk on the left, did not wear their hats straight, did not button their clothes properly, or spat on the ground were corrected. Few residents and shops dared to casually discard paper scraps, skin shells, or dump garbage, and many were persuaded by the Boy Scouts not to rinse their mouths or splash water in front of the door, and were ashamed. It is heard that the results of the labor service of each unit will be evaluated by the inspectors, and the score of this activity will account for a part of the overall score.</p>
<p>Female Boy Scout Labor Service, Rural Hygiene Movement, divided into nine districts. The number of female Boy Scouts assigned to each district depends on the density of the villages and the population. More districts have one to two hundred people, and fewer districts have several to several tens of people. Their service locations are: rural four districts are Zhuangyuan, Housanzhuang, Zhongzhuang, and Qiansanzhuang; urban five districts are Yingfang, Xiaoling Street, Zhongling Street, Wu Ke Song, and Xin. Each district is marked with signs and flags. For example, in Xiaolingwei Street, they inspected whether the barber tools in the barbershops were disinfected after use, whether the towels were clean and white, whether the barber wore a mask when cutting hair, and whether they still cleaned customers' eyes and ears. Because this street has only recently been assigned to the urban area, the commercial aspects have not yet been as specific as in the city, so there are still many deficiencies in sanitation equipment. After the Boy Scouts' persuasion, they admitted and accepted the advice. They then went to advise on the hygiene of teahouse stoves (food must have lids and rags must be clean), teahouse hygiene (urinals must be set up and towels must be white and disinfected), and personal hygiene. Those who went to the countryside inspected rural families, such as dietary hygiene and housing hygiene, in accordance with the regulations on hygiene matters, and gave detailed explanations and persuasion to implement any unhygienic points. It is heard that the score of this item is included in a part of the overall score of each unit. Those who do not participate or who participate but fail to complete the prescribed work will not be given points. Therefore, each Boy Scout is extremely diligent in service.</p>

<p>Grand Opening Ceremony (International News Agency)</p>
<h3>Scouting Review and Camp Inspection (Non-)</h3>
<p>By the 8th, all participating units had settled and arranged their camps appropriately. The writer entered Ren'ai Gate on the afternoon of the same day to inspect the camp. All that was seen and heard, all questions and answers with recordable value, are described below:</p>
<p>The Guizhou Province Scout camp was adorned with a few pine branches and paper flowers on both sides, sparsely and elegantly arranged. Inside, there were four or five screens, each capable of accommodating twenty people.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal School for the Blind and Deaf Scout camp, in addition to four screens, also had a command camp and two tents for resting and eating.</p>
<p>The Hunan screens were stationed on a hillside, with twenty screens overlooking a quiet location.</p>
<p>Anqing Girls' Middle School in Anhui had eleven screens, while the boys' junior high school and other schools had over ten screens. Both male and female scouts had dug several round holes in the ground for cooking rice. During the writer's inspection, he saw teacher Qian Hongde leading the scouts in road construction, with much progress already made. Above the camp gate of this unit, a map made of cowhide showing the distribution of participating scout troops from various counties in the province was creatively displayed, allowing people to see at a glance which counties were involved. Each screen had an additional layer of rainproof cloth.</p>
<p>The Henan camp gate was made of bamboo, forming a tall square frame, covered with red cloth, forming several crosses, to celebrate the Double Tenth holiday. Posters were also affixed outside the screens.</p>
<p>Gansu used short pieces of wood to piece together the characters for "Gansu" as the camp gate, appearing simple and unadorned.</p>
<p>The scouts outside the Suiyuan screens were mostly engaged in soil cultivation and weeding.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi camp gate had two platforms that could be climbed using ladders, allowing people to ascend and look far into the distance.</p>
<p>Inside the Shanxi screens, many lanterns were hung for nighttime patrols. The scouts were busy making pine branches in preparation for National Day.</p>
<p>The Hankou City screens were all made of green rainproof material, making them both more aesthetically pleasing and rainproof.</p>
<p>The Jiangning camp gate was made of wooden strips in the style of a tank observation tower, inlaid with figures of people, horses, bows, and commanders, showing great ingenuity.</p>
<p>The Fujian camp gate was made of wooden square pillars, colorfully painted and adorned with four or five red and green paper balls, making it extremely artistic.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang camp gate had a two-story observation tower, with a large bell and drum, and a radio loudspeaker on the middle floor. The upper floor had a sentry post. The washbasin stands outside the screens were neatly arranged, demonstrating discipline.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Jiangxi camp gate were watercolor portraits of Huang Lizhou, Wen Tianxiang, Xie Dieshan, Wang Chuanshan, Wang Yangming, Lu Xiangshan, Ouyang Xiu, Wang Anshi, and other virtuous predecessors, inspiring people to admire national heroes.</p>
<p>Inside the Tianjin camp, underground camps were dug for resting, and clean pits were dug with board covers to prevent littering. The wooden tables and stools made by Nankai and other schools could be folded into boxes, making them lightweight and convenient for travel.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu camp gate was made of bamboo in the shape of a square pillar, decorated with powder, resembling a city wall, making it extremely grand. On it were inscribed "Wisdom, Benevolence, Courage," and "New Life" maxims. Some camp gates used rope circles to form square pillars, with rope-made spheres resembling light bulbs, also showing ingenuity.</p>
<p>In front of the Shanghai camp gate was a tall wooden "totem." Those who didn't know thought it was a cross, but it was actually adopted from the earliest European and Western peoples, representing something to be admired. "Totem" is a transliteration of a Western word, with carvings of lions, monkeys, and camels. The lion represents strength, the monkey represents liveliness, and the camel represents height. The old totem beast once had lyrics written by Mr. Cai Yuanpei. After the Shanghai scouts entered the camp, they began camp construction. The construction of the camp gate was exceptionally grand, with six observation towers built on both sides, and a horizontal plaque with the words "Shanghai" inscribed by the Mayor of Shanghai. It was over forty feet tall. Telephones were placed on the observation towers to relay messages directly to the command camp. Each main office camp also had telephones for communication. In addition to the camp gate, eight convenient gates were built around the perimeter to facilitate traffic. The road construction in the camp was even more significant. The camp was rugged and uneven, but after the engineering team worked all day, it was transformed into a smooth road. Areas that were too low and inconvenient to develop were bridged. There were flat roads from the front and rear of the camp gate to the gates of each group. There was a bulletin board inside the gate, publishing one issue daily. A sundial was set up in the center of the camp, made of branches and stones, using the sun to observe the time. The command camp erected three sides of cowhide next to the camp for all scouts and guests to sign as a memento.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yunnan and Chahar troops seen were honest and pleasing. Other units had arrived at the camp and settled in, but due to the approaching dusk, those not inspected were briefly omitted.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Participating in the World Games and Traveling in Europe: Recollections of the China-England Match</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>August 6, 1936, is a day worth commemorating for our football comrades, because it was the first time our Chinese football team participated in a competition in a world-class tournament—it was our first offering on the European continent as the publicly recognized hegemon of the East, and it was the day we were eliminated by Great Britain (referred to as England) in the first week. Although the result of our 2-0 defeat spread around the world through telegrams, detailed records can probably only be found in the German World Games newspapers of the time. Especially regarding the content of the two teams outside of the battle situation, I am afraid that no one in the world knows more about it than I do. From my conversations with the leaders, coaches, and captains of the English team, and from my relentless pursuit of information before and after the match, I obtained some information that others could not obtain. I am now compiling it into a table for the research of comrades and the comparison of fans:</p>
<p>England, China</p>
<p>Number of Team Members, 22, 22</p>
<p>Number of Affiliated Associations, 8, 6</p>
<p>Average Age, 24, 25</p>
<p>Average Weight, 166, 148</p>
<p>Average Height, 5 feet 10 inches, 5 feet 8 inches</p>
<p>Average Experience, 6 years, 7 years</p>
<p>Dedicated Training, Ten Days, Played 27 Matches</p>
<p>Coach, Famous English Coach, None</p>
<p>First Half, 0, 0</p>
<p>Final Result, 2, 0</p>
<p>Injured, 0, 0</p>
<p>If I were to tell people that we had the possibility of defeating England this time, or simply that we missed a good opportunity to defeat England, I am afraid that people would laugh at me for being a megalomaniac, overestimating myself, daydreaming, and saying cool-headed nonsense after the fact. Really, if I said this before the game, even I myself would laugh at myself for being arrogant, inappropriate, and immeasurable. But the facts after the event tell me (and the English team also admits) that based on the battle situation that day, we did have the possibility of winning. Now, looking back, let me start from the beginning:</p>
<p>On July 9th, we ended the battle in the Nanyang area in Mumbai, India. The athlete delegation from our motherland passed through this place, and we boarded the ship to join the team and set off for Europe. Our more than 60-day Nanyang tour created an excellent record of 27 victories without a single defeat, which increased our courage on the trip to Europe. During the voyage, we received news that the first week of the championship would be against England. We were depressed and disappointed as if we had been doused with cold water, half-believing and half-doubting, imagining our future tragic defeat. Who knew that football originated in England? Who didn't know that our country's football was directly or indirectly learned from the British people residing in China? To confront the advanced teacher in the capacity of a student is undoubtedly like hitting a stone with an egg. Everyone knows that the hope of victory is slim or even completely hopeless. The psychology of our team at that time was to try our best to show our abilities to outsiders through hard struggle, and at the same time hope to be a good loser, hoping that we would not be defeated so completely without any resistance under the struggle. During those ten days or so on the ship, we were resting for the hard work of the Nanyang battle, so we rested the whole time and never trained once. This round of recuperation was with the sympathy and special permission of Chief Secretary Shen Siliang and Head Coach John Ma.</p>
<p>On July 23rd, we arrived safely in Berlin, the location of the conference. The news that we would face England in the first week was also confirmed in the schedule. At that time, we were training in a stable life on the one hand, and eagerly waiting for the arrival of the English team on the other hand, so as to investigate their strength and prepare for the one in ten chances of survival. We lived in Döberitz, 30 kilometers from the city. It was the general area for male athletes. Women were not allowed to enter. The place was beautifully decorated, the scenery was very secluded, and the food and accommodation were rich and comfortable. Everyone who lived there expressed satisfaction and a feeling of complete equipment. Our training was to get up at 5:30 every morning and gather at the stadium in the village at 6:00 to do soft gymnastics and various slight movements, and then run in circles to practice long breath. Every two or three days, we would go to the field outside to practice the ball in the afternoon, sometimes practicing shooting, sometimes dividing into teams to compete, and studying attacking and defending formations. Our hard work and training in advance showed that although we had some resentment for the bad luck of being arranged with England, we were absolutely not discouraged, because we knew that if we tried our best to deal with it and still failed, and lost to the advanced football country of England, I believe no one would blame us. Our mentality was "Nothing to lose everything to gain". We were prepared to fail and fight with others, and we were determined to fight hard even if we failed.</p>
<p>One day, a compatriot from overseas whom I had never met before sent me a letter on the left:</p>
<p>"Captain Huitang, I respectfully address you, in this World Games football championship, our country will meet England in the first week, and everyone thinks it is hopeless. However, based on my years of experience living in Europe, the strength of England's amateurs is not surprising. Therefore, the strong teams in this session are in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Poland, not in England. I hope you will do your best and work hard to eliminate England, and the eyes and ears of the world will be refreshed. I wish you victory, Your brother, So-and-so, respectfully."

In addition, there is a chronicle of major events of the Chinese delegation, describing the actual work of the delegation. Those who care about sports will definitely want to read it first. It is also understood that the association has made special arrangements with the postal bureau to facilitate readers in the interior, and all post offices across the country can subscribe to the publication on their behalf, thus avoiding the trouble of sending letters and remittances.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Small Ball Association: Board Meeting Called for This Sunday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Small Ball Association, which once hosted the performance of the Sixth National Games, has been actively planning the promotion of association affairs since holding the Mayor's Cup, the first city-wide competition, in the spring. The recent situation of the association is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment of a Referee Committee: Shanghai sports has always been known for its development, and all sports have organized referee committees. However, the small ball community alone has been lacking. Now, in order to meet the demand, the association has decided to organize a small ball referee committee to reduce unnecessary disputes arising from competitions and to ensure the permanent safety of referees.</p>
<p>Publication of a Special Issue: Small soccer has been around for nearly ten years, and the city-wide competition initiated by Mayor Wu is the most historically valuable. Therefore, the association spared no effort to collect dozens of valuable photos from the opening to the closing ceremony, and edited the entire competition process, including brief histories of the participating teams, and printed publications to distribute to all sectors of society, in order to promote publicity and commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Convening a Board Meeting: The association believes that small rubber balls are only suitable for practice by Chinese people and are not easily promoted internationally. Therefore, it consulted with the Xiexing Sporting Goods Company and decided to custom-make a large number of British-style small soccer balls. It is scheduled to launch a league in the shortest possible time, so as to improve the inherent shortcomings of small rubber balls and avoid the intense danger of soccer, achieving two goals with one move. It is hoped that the small ball community will strongly support it.</p>
<p>Feast for Tai and Jia: Tai Rugan (honorary president of the association), a member of our country's World Games inspection delegation, and Jia Youliang, the only small ball athlete to attend the World Games soccer team, have now returned. Yesterday, the association specially sent out invitations and is scheduled to hold a banquet at the Dalichun Restaurant this Sunday evening.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Track and Field Team Announced</h3>

<h3>Japanese Marines Conducted Exercises Across the Border Yesterday Morning: Rumors in the City Have Gradually Subsided</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai held a street fighting exercise in the area of Huayuan Street next to the Jiangwan Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Jiangwan Road in the city at around 9:30 yesterday morning. Two Japanese officers commanded the scene, and the Japanese troops participating in the exercise were divided into two parts, attacking and defending. The attacking part advanced from the entrance of Huayuan Street to the North Japanese Brewery, and the defending part stubbornly resisted by relying on the defensive works completed the previous day. During the exercise, pedestrians were prohibited from traveling and gathering to watch, and residents nearby felt slightly uneasy because of this. The exercise ended at around 10:30 and the troops returned to the barracks. As for the situation in the North Sichuan Road area, a small number of Japanese soldiers with guns were still standing guard near Qiujiang Road, Sida Road, Tiantong'an Station, and the Japanese military outposts. Military vehicles and patrols were still traveling to and from the thoroughfares and sometimes still hovered in the Zhabei area of ​​the city. The Japanese outpost at 1097 Disway Road seemed to be more heavily guarded than yesterday. All the military equipment on the roof of the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps at the end of North Sichuan Road was formerly covered with tarpaulins. Yesterday afternoon, the tarpaulins were removed, and Japanese soldiers were stationed on the lookout. All military telephones at various locations seem to be concentrated on the platform. The wires next to our platform are intertwined like cobwebs. Inside the Japan Brewery behind the 63rd Garden, at around 4:30 pm yesterday, more than 100 Japanese soldiers left the factory in four military vehicles, and it is not known where they went. Only a few Japanese soldiers were left in the factory to guard it. It is not possible to confirm for the time being whether they were withdrawn to the barracks or transferred. According to the intention, the number of formal Japanese troops in Shanghai before the 23rd of last month was 3,000. The exact number has been increased once, but based on the situation in recent days, including the original 4,000 stationed in China, the eastward and westward movement of Japanese troops in recent days may be to avoid outside estimates of their numbers. As for the rumors in the city, they have gradually subsided yesterday. The trend of moving has decreased compared to before after the municipal authorities issued a warning.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Tao Changshan reported that today is the second redemption of the principal of the Category C bonds of the Unified Government Bonds of the Republic of China for the 25th year, and the 15th redemption of the principal of the short-term government bonds for the dredging of the Haihe River project in Hebei Province. For the lottery method, the last three digits of the Unified Government Bonds Category C will be used, and the last two digits of the Haihe River Government Bonds will be used. Now, I will briefly report to you on the details of the above two types of bonds: (1) The Category C bonds of the Unified Government Bonds of the Republic of China for the 25th year were issued in February of the 25th year of the Republic of China, with a fixed amount of 350 million national currency. In addition to the first redemption of the principal and silver, which has already been drawn, this is the second redemption of the principal. Five branches will be drawn, with each branch being 350,000 yuan, totaling 1.75 million yuan for the principal to be redeemed, and the second period of interest coupons, totaling 10.4475 million yuan for interest to be paid, and the total principal and interest to be paid is 12.1975 million yuan. (2) The short-term government bonds for dredging the Haihe River project in Hebei Province were issued in April of the 18th year of the Republic of China, with a total amount of 4 million yuan. In addition to the first to 14th redemptions of the principal and silver, which have already been drawn, this is the 15th redemption of the principal. Five branches will be drawn, with each branch being 40,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan for the principal to be redeemed, and the 15th interest coupons, totaling 57,600 yuan for interest to be paid, and the total principal and interest to be paid is 257,600 yuan. The principal and interest due for the above-mentioned winning bonds, except for the Haihe River government bonds, which are scheduled to be paid by the Central China and Bank of Communications in Beiping and Tianjin from October 20, the Category C bonds of the Unified Government Bonds will be paid by the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Bank of Communications entrusted by it from January 31, 26, and the Central Trust Bureau will begin payment. In order to facilitate the holders' financing needs, this department has issued a letter to the three banks on February 15, 25, stating that those who hold the winning bonds of the Category C bonds of the Unified Government Bonds and the interest coupons due at the end of January 26 may discount them at the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, and may rediscount them at the Central Bank. The report is merged. Now, please ask the supervisors to inspect the lottery tickets and the lottery ticket register for execution.</p>

<h3>Designated Defense Attorney Zhang Zhirang Submits Appeal Reasons on Behalf of Ye Haisheng, Presenting Five Points of Defense: (1) Physical Evidence Presented by the Police; (2) Ye Haisheng's Confession; (3) Motive for Murder; (4) Defendant's Counter-Evidence; (5) True Facts That Can Be Inferred from the Evidence in This Case. Request Impartial Trial and Judgment, Reversing the Original Verdict and Declaring Ye Haisheng Not Guilty.</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the case of Cantonese individuals Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, who were accused of fatally shooting Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, was judged by the First Special District Court. Yang and Ye were sentenced to death, while Zhou was acquitted. Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng have since been visited by their respective defense attorneys, who discussed the reasons for appeal in detail. Ye Haisheng's designated defense attorney, Zhang Zhirang, has submitted the appeal reasons to the Second Branch of the High Court. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Original Text of the Appeal</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the designated defense attorney of Ye Haisheng appealing the judgment, this petition presents the reasons for appeal. The original trial sentenced Ye Haisheng to death for murder, and an appeal has been filed. The original trial determined that the handgun presented by the police was the weapon used to kill Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Doulean Road at 9:00 PM on November 9th of last year. The bullet and shell casing were fired from that gun and struck the sailor. The "Practical Physics" book with a gun-shaped cutout was the book in which Yang Wendao hid the handgun. Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and others conspired to snipe at Japanese officers or soldiers, hoping to incite unrest and expand their influence in the Hongkou area. Yang Wendao was the instigator and commanded the operation, handing the handgun to Ye Haisheng, who committed the actual crime. However, none of the evidence adopted by the original trial is true. The injustice in this case arises from Zheng Weimin, Zeng Yuan, and others, who colluded to frame the defendants in order to obtain the reward offered by the Municipal Council and the Japanese side for capturing the murderer. We now ask the court to examine the following points: (1) Physical evidence presented by the police; (2) Ye Haisheng's confession; (3) Motive for murder; (4) Defendant's counter-evidence; (5) True facts that can be inferred from the evidence in this case.</p>
<p>(1) Physical Evidence Presented by the Police</p>
<p>(1) Handgun and Six Bullets Originally Left Inside: A handgun and six bullets originally left inside were presented by the police, who claimed that a Japanese deputy detective found the gun under a wooden kiosk used by watchmen in Fengle Li. The time was 11:40 PM (according to the deputy detective's testimony), which was one hour and thirty-odd minutes after Nakayama Hideo was killed. The location was 509 feet away from the scene of the crime (as reported by Western Deputy Inspector Claude). To say that this handgun was definitely the one that killed Nakayama Hideo is already far-fetched. Furthermore, the gun was supposedly found under the wooden kiosk. The Western detective even used his cane to poke it out during Ye Haisheng's reenactment. The Municipal Council's lawyer also stated, "Because the Japanese detectives arrived at the scene that night and suspected there might be a handgun, they used electric lights to search everywhere, and indeed found a handgun under the kiosk. Naturally, they also used a wooden stick to poke it out," etc. (all seen in Ye Haisheng's reenactment record). If the perpetrator fled after the crime, he would be afraid of being discovered and would carry the weapon for self-defense. It would be advantageous, not harmful, to keep it. It is already illogical to say that he would throw the gun on the ground, making a noise. Now it is claimed that the perpetrator stopped on the way while fleeing for his life, calmly bending down and placing the gun under the kiosk. Who would believe this? Moreover, according to the deputy detective's testimony, "At 11:40 PM, I received a report from Japanese detective Kairi Yamamo that a Japanese soldier had been shot and killed, and I immediately rushed to the scene." "At 11:40 PM, I found a handgun," etc. (see May 1st record). This indicates that he found the gun under the kiosk immediately after learning of the incident. However, according to the aforementioned reenactment record, he used a flashlight to shine under the kiosk and poked it out with a wooden stick. Furthermore, the police previously made a judgment based on the results of their investigation of the Nakayama Hideo murder case, stating that "the gun used in the murder case" was found behind Li Hongbin's wooden house in Fengle Li. Someone wanted to frame Li Hongbin, so they placed the gun there, etc. (see the police's eleventh record). This view is roughly the same as that of the defendants' attorneys. Furthermore, Western Deputy Inspector stated on May 27th, in explaining why the bullet was found behind the sailor, "There were one or two hundred people from various parties who came to the scene on official business." The police lawyer further stated on July 10th, in explaining the same issue, "There were already one or two hundred people from various parties who came to the scene on official business at that time, plus onlookers, no less than three or four hundred people. All within half a li were occupied by these three or four hundred people," etc. If this claim accurately reflects the situation at the time, then what reason is there to guarantee that the handgun was not planted? What evidentiary value does it have in this case?</p>
<p>(2) Bullet and Shell Casing Found: The police also presented a bullet and a shell casing, claiming that they were found at the scene by Japanese detectives No. 61 and No. 51 from the Dixiwei Road police station, respectively. However,</p>
<p>(A) Japanese detective No. 61 clearly stated, "I found a bullet eight feet south of the bloodstain." Nakayama Hideo was returning to the barracks from south to north on Baolean Road (see Western Deputy Inspector Claude's statement on May 1st regarding the sailor's movements). The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the front of the head. The sailor only suffered one bullet wound (both seen in the diagnosis of Japanese military doctor Ogawa Kenkichi and the statement on May 6th). Therefore, if the bullet was indeed the one that killed the sailor, it should have landed in front of the sailor, not eight feet behind him. Regardless of whether the bullet was actually found, it cannot be considered the bullet that killed the sailor. After this point was raised in court by the defense attorney, the police lawyer claimed that it was found in front of the body. After the defense attorney pointed out the locations on the diagram presented by the police, Western Deputy Inspector Claude was tasked with answering. Claude initially argued that the bullet entered at an angle from the rear, but even if it entered at an angle, the bullet should still have landed to the front, slightly off to the side. Moreover, based on the diagnosis of military doctor Ogawa Kenkichi and the photograph of the deceased's head, the angle was very slight. Therefore, when the military doctor was asked in court, "It went in from the back of the head and came out from the front of the head, is that correct?" he replied, "Yes." "There is a hole in the back of the head, and there is also a hole in the front of the head." The above explanation is difficult to establish. The Western Deputy Inspector then stated, "The deceased was five feet eight inches tall. He may have taken two steps forward before falling to the ground after being shot." However, it is not reasonable to say that a person whose brain has been penetrated by a bullet can walk eight steps beyond where the bullet landed. The Western Deputy Inspector further stated that there were one or two hundred people who came to the scene on official business afterwards, and that the bullet may have been kicked away. However, the Japanese detective No. 61 who found the bullet clearly stated, "After the incident at 9:00 PM on November 9th, I rushed to the scene and saw a pool of blood. I found a bullet eight feet south of the bloodstain," etc. He clearly stated that he rushed to the scene and found the bullet immediately after the incident at 9:00 PM. This Japanese detective was among the first to arrive at the scene, as clearly stated by the police. There was no crowded or chaotic situation at that time. Even assuming that there was such a situation, the police's explanation is only that the bullet may have been kicked away. However, what the police should prove is that the bullet was definitely the one that killed the sailor. Even according to their claims, at most, it is only possible, which is far from proving it. Furthermore, if there were really one or two hundred people present when the bullet was found, and according to the police lawyer, there were a total of three or four hundred people including onlookers, and the bullet was found in a place where it should not have landed, then what reason is there to guarantee that it was not planted? What evidentiary value does it have in this case? The original trial adopted the Western Deputy Inspector's conjecture that the bullet may have been kicked to the south because there were many people at the scene as the basis for determining the facts, and used the fact that the location where the bullet was found and the location where the shell casing was found formed a straight line as an argument to prove that the conjecture was reasonable. However, the rationale for this is unclear. Since the bullet could be kicked around by anyone, any relationship to the shell casing could have occurred and formed a straight line or any other line. What is the difference? Furthermore, a straight line can be drawn between any two points, the bullet and the shell casing. What does a straight line even mean in relation to some third point?</p>
<p>(B) No bloodstains were found on the bullet after it was examined, so the bullet cannot be identified as the bullet that killed the victim. Although the Forensic Research Institute stated that bullets that penetrate animals at close range may not leave bloodstains, this is only a possibility in exceptional cases. In principle, bloodstains should still be present. Therefore, the fact that no bloodstains were found should still raise the presumption that the bullet was not the one that killed the victim. The police should bear the burden of providing further evidence to refute this claim.</p>
<p>(C) Guns of the same size often have the same bullets. Experts can only determine that the bullet could have been fired from the gun by examining the gun and bullet themselves. Whether it was actually fired from that gun still requires other facts to prove. The original trial adopted Western Detective McCarey's statement, simply asserting that the bullet was fired from the gun, but this is not justified. This point still needs to be proven. Since the police have no evidence on this point, even if the bullet was the one that killed the victim, it still cannot implicate the gun, and even less so the book with the gun-shaped cutout.</p>
<p>(3) Book with Gun-Shaped Cutout: The police presented a "Practical Physics" book with a gun-shaped cutout, claiming that it was found in Yang Wendao's room by Japanese detective No. 164. However, this book does not belong to Yang Wendao. It was planted by those who framed him in order to obtain the reward money. There are many points to be made regarding this book, which will be elaborated on separately.</p>
<p>(A) According to Yang Wendao, he obtained a handgun from Li Mu in 1933. Fearing that children would play with it, his cousin Yang Jianzhong taught him a simple method of hiding it in a book by cutting out a hole. He immediately followed suit. Later, the gun was returned, and the book became useless and was discarded, allowing children to play with it. The book presented by the police was actually planted by Yang Jianzhong. Witness Zhang Chen testified that he was childhood classmates with Zeng Yuan. He visited Zeng last winter and saw Guo Weimin (also known as Hirayama Motoichi, who had become a Japanese citizen. According to Western Deputy Inspector's report on May 20th, the arrest of Yang Wendao was based on his accusation) smoking with Zeng on the same bed, using a pencil to draw a handgun on paper. Zeng Yuan later invited him to go with him to Zheng's place to get money. Zheng was not home at first but returned soon after. Zeng introduced them. The next day, Zheng came and said that if he reported to the Japanese military headquarters that Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed by Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and Korean Jack, he could get a reward of 4,000 yuan. The original trial asked Zeng Yuan about this testimony (who was a police witness and present in court). Zeng said, "Totally correct." Zhang Chen also presented a document written by Zeng Yuan in his own handwriting regarding Chen Hongbi, a female teacher at Gangfu Guangdong Elementary School. Zeng Yuan admitted in court that it was written in his own handwriting (see June 16th record). The collusion between Zhang Chen, Zheng Weimin, Zeng Yuan, and others is vividly described. Furthermore, Yang Jianzhong, who had been missing for a long time, suddenly surrendered to the police in August after the case was reopened for debate. He was brought to court by the police on August 19th. After being questioned, he clearly admitted that Yang Wendao was his distant uncle, and that he had known Zheng Weimin for six or seven years (police records show that Yang and Zheng had known each other for ten years). He had seen Zheng on April 2nd and April 16th, and had given Zheng Yang Wendao's address. He had also gone with him to meet Yang Guimei and had borrowed money from Zheng. After the case was filed, he went south to Guangzhou in May, and then traveled to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Zhenjiang (all seen in police records and the original trial's August 19th record). He also stated in the original trial, "Later, I felt that the atmosphere was very bad for me. Someone threatened to kill me, so I left because my life was important." If Yang Jianzhong had not been lying, why would he flee everywhere? If there had been no framing, why would anyone threaten to kill him? Furthermore, Zhang Chen also testified that one day, Zheng Weimin's wife asked him to go to Zheng Weimin's house. He saw Yang Jianzhong sitting in the living room (see June 3rd record). In light of the above testimonies, the claim that the presented book was fabricated by Zheng, Zeng, and others and planted by Yang Jianzhong is not without basis. As for the fingerprints remaining in the book, there are no ridges similar to Yang Jianzhong's fingerprints and palm prints. Yang Jianzhong only intended to plant the book, which would only require him to carry the book. The fingerprints inside the book are found on the inner pages and not on the cover. It is only natural for the fingerprints to not match. Therefore, the original trial's conclusion that the claim of planting is false is not justified. The original trial also stated that Yang Jianzhong did not admit to planting the book. There is no hope of him confessing to a crime. The original trial's conclusion is not reasonable because it did not pay attention to the above testimonies and the points listed below.</p>
<p>(B) The Forensic Research Institute, at the request of the original trial court, compared Yang Wendao's fingerprints and palm prints with the fingerprints found in the book. After repeated examinations, no similarities were found. Furthermore, there were bloody fingerprints in the book, clearly caused by cutting the hole with a knife. These also did not match Yang Wendao's fingerprints and palm prints (all seen in the institute's examination reports). If the book belonged to Yang Wendao, how could this have happened? This is conclusive evidence that the book was planted. The original trial ignored this crucial piece of evidence.</p>
<p>(C) Although the presented book appears old and dirty, the Forensic Research Institute's examination report clearly states that the temperature of the air "where it was placed" and the presence of oil or wax on the surface of the handgun can affect the speed of oxidation. Also, "There are two holes on the paper opposite the handgun's safety. The edges are curled and have rust stains and oil marks." This indicates that the cover was rusted with oil and wax. The report also states, "Deep marks and holes in the book are not easily formed without external pressure." This undoubtedly indicates that it was pressed together temporarily. The examination report provides sufficient evidence to prove that the book was made temporarily. The original trial did not mention this important assessment.</p>
<p>(D) Although the hole cut in the presented book appears old and uneven on the surface, the cuts inside the hole are not only neat, but also brand new. This is especially true at the two bends on the lower left side of the book and the short side near the upper left side. This phenomenon could not have occurred if it was not made temporarily. Although the examination report from the Forensic Research Institute stated that it is difficult to determine the age of the cuts, it clearly stated that the reason for the difficulty in determining the age is because "the gun-shaped cut marks examined by this institute are located in the book and are not easily exposed to external light and dust." The Forensic Research Institute only answered the question asked by the original trial based on its observations of the hole itself. Other relevant facts were not provided for research. What is this fact? The police claim that the book was used by Yang Wendao to hide the gun. If the book was indeed used for this purpose, and its use had lasted so long that the surface of the hole and the depth of the impressions were as described above, could the cuts inside the hole still be so neat and brand new? Everyone knows that this is impossible. However, this point was not submitted to the institute for assessment by the original trial. The institute naturally had no need to elaborate. Moreover, since it is a matter of common sense, there is no need to make a determination. However, the original trial did not pay attention to this point, even though the defense attorney repeatedly stated it in writing and in court.</p>
<p>(E) Although the original trial claimed that Yang Wendao admitted to the book in court on April 20th and only claimed on April 27th that the book did not belong to him and that he had another one before, the April 20th hearing was only for the police to request detention and was not the trial of the case. Therefore, when the original trial asked Yang Wendao, it only asked about the book held on the table and did not hand it over for inspection. The distance was far, making it difficult to distinguish. Yang Wendao did have a book, although one was in English and the other in Chinese, they were similar in shape and color (the presented book was published by the Commercial Press and is similar in shape and color to the original English book and translation). A book with a hole cut out to hide a gun is not a common item, so he did not expect this coincidence. Therefore, he admitted it without looking closely when asked, which shows his honesty and lack of concern. As for the fact that the book was not handed over for inspection during the court hearing on April 20th, page 29 of the May 9th record states that Yang Wendao said, "It's too far away, I can't see clearly." The court asked, "It's not even this far away, how can you not see clearly?"</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>This shows that the book was only shown on the table and not handed over for inspection during the first inquiry. As for Claude's report that Yang told him that the book belonged to him, Yang had already stated that Claude only held up the book. How could he know that it was different from his own book? The situation is similar to the admission in court. The original trial did not pay attention to this, and its mistake is the same as above.</p>
<p>(F) It remains to be proven whether the presented book was definitely the book used to hide the presented handgun. Guns of the same brand and size have identical designs. Therefore, a hole cut for one gun can fit any other gun of that brand and size. The impressions left by each gun will also be the same. The original trial's determination that the book was always used to hide the presented handgun based on the report of a fingerprint staff member of the Municipal Council is not appropriate. As for the reference to the Forensic Research Institute's assessment, this is a misunderstanding. The original trial's letter asked, "If a handgun of the same brand and size is stored in the book with rust marks from storing a handgun, would the rust marks be the same?" In other words, if the book has rust due to storing gun A, can its rust marks be the same as the rust of another gun of the same brand and size? Everyone knows that the answer is no. The Forensic Research Institute's response was the same. The original trial further asked, "If a handgun of the same brand and size rusts and is stored in the book, can the rust marks in the book be absolutely the same?" The institute replied, "There may be occasional similarities, but the location and shape of the rust stains are difficult to match exactly." This is also a natural principle. However, the original trial did not ask whether the rust in the book matches the rust of the presented handgun exactly. The institute naturally did not address this issue. The original trial considered this to be a confirmation of the above-mentioned report from the fingerprint staff member of the Municipal Council and used it to determine that the book was definitely used to hide the presented handgun. Is this not a misunderstanding? In conclusion, the presented book must be related to the presented handgun in order to research the above points. The original trial did not obtain evidence to form the foundation of the original judgment.</p>
<p>(G) Yang Wendao's servant, Chen Rongzhu, who was previously arrested and prosecuted, testified repeatedly that he did not see the presented book in Yang's house. He said that Yang's book was in English.</p>
<p>(H) Based on the above points, it is clear that the book does not belong to Yang Wendao. The defense attorney would like to raise a theoretical question: Even if the book belonged to Yang Wendao, the gun was found in his house, the gun was definitely hidden in the book, and the bullet was fired from the gun and killed Nakayama Hideo, can it be concluded that Nakayama Hideo was definitely killed by Yang Wendao? It should be noted that what was found in Yang Wendao's house was not the gun, but only the book for hiding the gun, not the murder weapon, but only the tool for hiding the murder weapon (assuming that the gun is the murder weapon). At most, it can only be inferred that the murder weapon was once in Yang's possession. Similarly, if a corpse is found on the ground with a knife next to it, and the knife is found to belong to someone, can this fact alone be used to determine that person is the murderer?</p>
<p>(2) Ye Haisheng's Confession</p>
<p>(1) Confession Was Not Voluntary: The original trial also used Ye Haisheng's confession as the basis for the judgment. However, Ye's confession is so bizarre and changeable that it is unprecedented. When he was requested by the police for detention, he clearly stated in court that he had nothing to do with the death of Nakayama Hideo and had never even been to Doulean Road. Later, after the police filed the charges, they originally requested that Yang Wendao be charged with firing the gun and Ye Haisheng be charged with assisting (the police lawyer stated in the May 1st record, "Now, after police investigation, it was the first defendant, Yang Wendao, who fired the gun, and the second defendant, Ye Haisheng, assisted at the scene"). At that time, Ye Haisheng also immediately admitted to going with Yang. After Yang fired the gun, he immediately fled back. However, at the second hearing, the police presented Ye Haisheng's statement, which was taken in the police station after the first hearing. It detailed the events before the incident. However, fearing injustice and not wanting to implicate others, Ye Haisheng suddenly stood up and admitted to killing the sailor alone. He said that the hole in the book was cut by himself. Witness Hu Xianghe had stated that he had not seen the book after the incident, but Ye Haisheng retorted, "He didn't see me. I saw him." At the same time, he also stated, "I was just saying whatever came to mind because I was afraid of suffering." "The previous two times were because the detectives in the police station told me that I would have to confess even if I didn't want to. They said that if I confessed, I could get a lighter sentence. So, I was confused and blamed him" (all seen in the May 6th record). After this change, the facts claimed by the plaintiff and the evidence they presented were completely incompatible with Ye Haisheng's confession. The plaintiff requested a two-week extension in court. On May 9th, when Zhou Sherong's case was heard, the plaintiff presented Ye Haisheng's new statement, claiming that Yang, Ye, and others had conspired beforehand and went together that night. Ye fired the gun on the spot. Ye immediately admitted to this in court. Later, at the third hearing of this case on May 10th, he not only admitted it but also provided a detailed account. He even reenacted the events on September 22nd. However, the May 20th record states, "Ye Haisheng cried." When asked, "Since you did it alone, a hero does what a hero should. Why are you crying?" he did not answer. The May 22nd reenactment record also states, "Didn't you say before that you retreated and ran south?" "The answer is that I ran south, so I said I ran south (then he whispered injustice)." The record also states that Ye Haisheng said, "Oh, I'm going back to the moon palace (then he whispered, Judge, save me)." "Why?" "He hesitated and did not answer." At the fourth hearing on May 27th, he began to cry and deny any involvement in the killing of the sailor, claiming that he had been tortured in the police station. The original trial sent a forensic doctor to examine him. According to the examination report, the ribs appeared to have been rubbed by a soft object. The examination was conducted on the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, which corresponded to Ye Haisheng's claim that he used nasal drip water and rubbed his ribs with his fists to make the water go down. The examination report also stated that there was a scar one centimeter long and half a centimeter wide on the skin of the upper lip below the nostrils. It was long, oval, soft, and very neat. This corresponds to Ye Haisheng's claim that he stuffed a cigarette into his nose and burned it. Even the certificate from Dr. Johnston, the deputy inspector of the Municipal Council Hospital, stated that the scar could have been caused by burning. Based on its thickness and the neatness of the upper and lower edges, it is clear that it could not have been caused by scratching or biting. Furthermore, the examination report stated that it had not been more than two or three weeks since the injury, which is consistent with Ye Haisheng's claim that he suffered the injuries after the hearing on May 6th (after his first confession). All of Ye Haisheng's statements above can be found in the May 27th and June 3rd records. It is undeniable that Ye Haisheng's confession was not voluntary.</p>
<p>(2) Reenactment Was Not Voluntary: Ye Haisheng's reenactment on May 22nd was a direct result of his statement in court on May 20th. He had already been taken to the police station twice for guidance (see Claude's report in the May 20th record). He had memorized the details of the location. Throughout the entire process, he was flanked by two Japanese detectives and handcuffed. Other Japanese detectives followed his movements. He moved when they told him to move and stopped when they told him to stop. Although it was called a reenactment, it was actually a directed performance.</p>
<p>(3) Confession and Reenactment Do Not Match the Facts: A. Examination report No. 43 from the Forensic Research Institute stated that based on the angle of the bullet's trajectory through the victim's head, the shooting distance was about 50 centimeters. Based on the gunpowder residue on the wound, the distance was only about 5 centimeters. This is tens of times different from Ye Haisheng's reenactment of shooting from a distance of five or six steps. At that distance, the angle could only be achieved by shooting while lying on the ground. The most important point of the reenactment does not match the facts.</p>
<p>B. Police witness Pan Qiaoying testified that she saw a Japanese sailor and another person walking north in opposite directions (see July 28th record). She also stated in the police station that they were "walking parallel in the same direction" (see the third record). This does not match Ye's claim that he was following a few steps behind.</p>
<p>C. Ye Haisheng's reenactment of escaping through the two vertical posts in Fengle Li does not match Hu Xianghe's reenactment of escaping by going around the telephone pole (see reenactment record).</p>
<p>D. Hu Xianghe testified that "the clothes of the person who escaped looked like a sailor's uniform" (see May 6th record) and that "the person was shorter than Ye Haisheng and had a wider waist than Ye." This does not match Ye Haisheng's clothing and his tall, slender figure. E. Ye Haisheng stated that he ran directly to his home on Qiujiang Road when escaping from Fengle Li, which does not match his previous statement that he returned to the Yuegong Hotel.</p>
<p>F. Furthermore, his claims of turning around in the small alley in Fengle Li and not escaping directly to North Sichuan Road and returning to Fengle Li are not credible based on the local terrain.</p>
<p>G. Ye Haisheng claimed that he had discussed the matter at the Tongyi Association and that two Koreans, Jack and others, were present. However, the landlord of the house, Zhu Senfu, and the tea waiter of the association, Ji Agen, both stated that they had never seen Ye Haisheng and that no Koreans had been there.</p>
<p>(4) According to Article 270, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the defendant's confession must not be the result of violence, coercion, enticement, fraud, or other improper methods and must be consistent with the facts in order to be used as evidence. It is very clear that Ye Haisheng's confession cannot form the basis for a criminal judgment. As for the violence and coercion aspect, the original trial actually believed that the confession was not the result of torture. As for the aspect of whether it is consistent with the facts, it pointed out that the important detail of following the sailor in the confession did not match the testimonies of various witnesses, the assessment, and the diagnostic drawing, and dismissed it with a single sentence that Ye's statement was not credible. The original trial based its belief that the confession was consistent with the facts on Hu Xianghe and Pan Qiaoying, both of whom testified that they saw a person wearing black clothing. The police found a black suit belonging to Ye in Qingdao. Winter clothing is mostly dark in color, and a suit and a soldier's uniform are clearly different. Under the streetlights, they can both be called black. What is so strange about that? The original trial used this trivial point to determine that the murder confession was true, which shows the weakness of its reasoning. Furthermore, the case file of the Songhu Garrison Command stated that Ye Haisheng was known as a member of the Ax Gang. However, after reviewing the case file, Ye Haisheng was released because he was not a suspect. This has nothing to do with whether the confession is consistent with the facts.</p>
<p>(3) Motive for Murder</p>
<p>The police claim that Yang, Ye, and others committed the crime of murder, but there is no motive. After the original trial repeatedly discussed this point, they presented Ye's statement, in which Ye admitted to the police that he wanted to incite unrest and take the opportunity to expand his influence in Hongkou. However, what influence did Yang and Ye have that they wanted to expand? If there was unrest in Hongkou, how could they expand their influence? Using murder as a way to expand influence is unbelievably stupid. It is also not something that Yang and Ye could do. The original trial believed this, which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>(4) Defendant's Counter-Evidence</p>
<p>The relevant witnesses in this case were first questioned by the police and then brought to court. Almost all of them had a statement with them and admitted to it in court. During the criminal trial, the prosecutor's investigation was conducted simultaneously and from the beginning to the end. The scope of the investigation was not limited to Shanghai and even went as far as Qingdao. As a result, the witnesses did not dare to tell the truth or avoided it. Although the defendants had witnesses to present, they either did not tell the truth or avoided it. It is difficult to present counter-evidence. However, there are several points that are beneficial to the defendant. (1) Ye Haisheng stated that there was a fight at the Nanyang Dance Hall on the night of its opening. Yao Songting, the inspector of the hall, stated that the hall opened on November 8th (see June 16th record). He and police witness Zhang Caiyuan stated that there was a fight that night and that they saw Ye standing outside the dance floor a few minutes later (see police's 27th record). (2) Ye Haisheng celebrated his mother's birthday at Dachina on November 10th, and Zhang Caiyuan reserved the banquet for him, which Zhang Caiyuan admitted (see June 16th record). On the day before and the day after the sailor was killed, Ye was busy with other matters. How could he suddenly commit murder in between? (3) Ye was often at the Yuegong in the evening, which is easy to prove. Therefore, his involuntary confession admitted that he left the Yuegong before the murder and returned to the Yuegong immediately after the murder, leaving a brief moment in the middle to go out and commit the murder, as if murder was the same as going for a walk. As a result, this counter-evidence lost its effectiveness. (4) Ye Haisheng received a call from Zhang Caiyuan saying that the police wanted to arrest him and that he should escape quickly. Ye told Mi Baosheng about this, which Mi Baosheng testified to on June 16th. All of the above points are counter-evidence that the defendant could not have committed the murder that day.</p>
<p>(5) True Facts That Can Be Inferred from the Evidence in This Case</p>
<p>Based on the results of the original trial's investigation, it is not only possible to know that the death of Nakayama Hideo had nothing to do with Ye Haisheng, but it is also possible to infer who actually shot and killed the sailor. Based on the most accurate standard of gunpowder residue, the Forensic Research Institute determined that the distance between the handgun and the victim's head when it was fired was only about 5 centimeters. At a distance of 5 centimeters, the gun was close to the head. If the murderer was following behind the victim, there is no reason to follow until touching the victim before firing. The murderer was clearly walking alongside the victim and suddenly fired (Pan Qiaoying also testified that the two were walking parallel, see above). Western Deputy Inspector Claude detailed the victim's movements on the day he was killed. From the morning until 8:40 PM, he was in places similar to brothels, except for the time from 4:00 PM to 6:40 PM when he was in the barracks and from 6:40 PM to 8:00 PM when his whereabouts were unknown. He went to four places in total. The Western Deputy Inspector also stated that "Xihe Haier wanted him to stay the night, but he refused" (see May 2nd record). It can be inferred that the victim was a playboy. He was killed after refusing to stay overnight and while walking back near the barracks. He was probably killed due to jealousy or a love triangle.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it is clear that the death of Nakayama Hideo had nothing to do with Ye Haisheng. This case arose because someone colluded to frame the defendants in order to obtain the reward money. We respectfully submit this petition and request your honorable court to consider that murder is a heinous crime and that the death penalty is the most severe punishment. Please grant a thorough trial, reverse the original judgment, and declare Ye Haisheng not guilty in order to redress the injustice. This would be an act of both public service and personal virtue. Respectfully submitted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<h3>Bank of China - Cornerstone Laying Ceremony for New Building Today</h3>
<p>The Bank of China is constructing a grand building at the intersection of Renji Road on the Bund. The progress of the project has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. We have learned that the bank will hold the cornerstone laying ceremony for the new building at 10 a.m. on this Double Tenth Day. Figures from the financial community in this city have been invited to attend and observe. The chairman of the Bank of China, Mr. Song Ziwen, will lay the cornerstone. Ms. Zhang Leyi, Mrs. Song, will place a commemorative box under the cornerstone. It is said that the box contains the blueprint of the new building, scenic views of the Bund, various newspapers published in this city, various current auxiliary coins, Bank of China exchange coupons, a list of bank employees, and the bank's most recent annual report.</p>
<p>Address of the Bank's New Building</p>
<p>East to the Bund, south to Renji Road, west to Yuanmingyuan Road, covering an area of approximately 55,000 square feet. The basement extends 13 feet below ground. Given the loose soil of Shanghai, and the presence of high-rise buildings on three sides, proximity to the riverbank, and the vibrations from passing streetcars, the difficulty of the excavation work is self-evident. Although the foundation work is not yet complete, the completed portions already reveal the meticulous planning of the bank's construction project. It is said that the exterior of the new building will convey a sense of solemnity amidst simplicity. The surrounding walls of the lower level will be made of Suzhou granite. The front will have eighteen stories, reaching a height of 227 feet. It will incorporate traditional Chinese architectural standards while meeting modern building needs, making it a unique landmark. The basement area is vast, equivalent to the entire foundation. The entrance from Yuanmingyuan Road leads to a large parking area. The facilities for vaults and safe deposit boxes are extremely sophisticated and sturdy, with a total of up to 10,000 safe deposit boxes. The new building is</p>
<p>Divided into Three Sections</p>
<p>One will be the headquarters of the bank's general management, one will be the bank's Shanghai branch, and one will be for rental. Various central government agencies in Shanghai will rent the front corridor on the ground floor as office space. The important sections of the bank's ground floor are the issuance and disbursement departments of the Shanghai branch. The first floor will house the trust department, savings department, the bank's business section, and the offices of the Shanghai branch's managers and assistant managers. The area occupied by the business section is over 15,000 square feet, with a semicircular flat roof 35 feet high. The second and third floors will be for the various sections of the general management and the offices of senior executives. The fourth floor will have guest rooms, rest rooms, a gymnasium, and a clinic. In addition, there will be a dining hall accommodating 400 people and a lecture hall accommodating 375 people. According to the architects' estimate, the total weight of the new building will</p>
<p>Reach 70,000 Tons</p>
<p>To support this weight, there will be 2,000 large piles, each approximately 100 feet long. The interior will be equipped with more than ten state-of-the-art and high-speed elevators. The passenger elevators will be fully automated, with a speed of up to 500 feet per minute. The entire bank office will be equipped with air conditioning and air regulation machines, heating pipes, water pipes, and fire protection equipment. The various iron pipes used will total 20 miles in length. The wiring for electric lights, telephones, electric bells, and various electric alarms will total over 70 miles. It is also said that the bank</p>
<p>Drilled Two Wells,</p>
<p>each 700 feet deep. The water drawn from the two wells can reach 600 gallons per minute. The completeness of the interior equipment will make it a giant among Shanghai's buildings.</p>

<h3>Traitor Activities - Attempting to Cause Disturbances by Sneaking into the Interior</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese problem has recently led to the proliferation of rumors, causing public unrest. Unexpectedly, a group of traitors are being used to disguise themselves and carry out activities in various counties near Shanghai. Previously, disguised traitors engaged in secret activities were seized in Baoyou's Dachan Town and the Shuangfeng Town bordering Kunshan and Taicang. Yesterday, it was discovered in Fangtai Town, Jiading County, that a person wearing a black twill cloth long gown, with a red nose, and speaking with a foreign accent, went to the town to secretly inquire about the local Public Security Bureau's firearms and other construction details. The town district office immediately detected this and immediately telephoned the Huangdu Town Third District Office for investigation. The office notified the Qingpu Sixth District Office and the Nanxiang Second Public Security Sub-bureau, which dispatched armed patrol teams to assist in the search. However, the traitor, realizing that he had been exposed by the villagers, fled elsewhere. When the police arrived, he had already vanished without a trace. According to local villagers, there were several people involved. After being detected by the authorities, they appeared flustered and may have fled towards Huangdu. The public security authorities of Jiading and Qingpu counties have jointly dispatched personnel to conduct secret investigations at various key points, and have notified the villagers to strengthen their vigilance to prevent villains from returning and disrupting local security.</p>
<h3>How to Cherish This Moment of Survival and Transition</h3>
<p>— Cai Jinjun</p>
<p>What day is today? It is the 25th anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China! What time is now? It is also the critical autumn of our nation's survival! In this time of survival and crisis, to commemorate the achievements of our martyrs in founding the nation, it is indeed a case of "auspicious days often come before us, and a hundred emotions move within us"!</p>
<p>In recent years, the nation's awakening to selfish psychology and the realization of the long-awaited unified situation are sufficient to confirm the potential for national rejuvenation. Therefore, even in this autumn of crisis and survival, with collective efforts and solidarity, we can steadily overcome difficulties, and the future holds hope! Compatriots! Are you thinking of how to save our country and repay our martyrs? Then quickly rise up and cherish this opportunity, and hold on to it firmly!</p>
<p>Then what is the way to cherish it? I say, do not waste. — Do not waste a single coin, do not waste a single bit of energy, do not waste a single second of time.</p>
<p>If we do not waste a single coin, then public funds will be used entirely for construction, and corruption will be completely eliminated. Private finances will be spent only on necessities, and harmful habits such as smoking and gambling will disappear without being banned. If we do not waste a single bit of energy, then suspicion, infighting, and reactionary conspiracies will be consciously abandoned, and everyone will focus their energy solely on the public welfare. If we do not waste a single second of time, then decadent romanticism, dependence, strikes, absenteeism, and other bad habits will be eliminated, and everyone will strive to work diligently and rely on their own efforts to regenerate themselves. Making enriching national defense and stabilizing people's livelihood the most urgent tasks, and resolving national crises and revitalizing the nation the common goal, if it benefits this, we will all strive for it; if it does not benefit this, even the slightest bit, we dare not waste it.</p>
<p>Then, what methods should be used to achieve this state? I say, we must quickly and universally promote the New Life Movement — only in this way can we revitalize the spirit of the people and restore the nation's self-confidence. Only in this way can we cultivate the habit of not wasting money, energy, and time. We must vigorously promote the National Economic Construction Movement — this is the key strategy for enriching national defense and stabilizing people's livelihood, and it is also the shortcut to saving the nation and revitalizing the nation. On the one hand, we must passively avoid wasting money, energy, and time; on the other hand, we must actively concentrate the nation's money, energy, and time, and channel them into this one correct path. Marching in unison and progressing together, if we can do this and persist without懈怠, then what can our vast nation of 450 million people not accomplish!</p>
<p>Recently, the overall situation is peaceful, the country is unified, and the crisis is showing a tendency to turn around. We should cherish and utilize this invaluable opportunity, not waste it in the slightest, and press forward with determination. At this time this year, we may still be ashamed to celebrate, but we must set this goal and not stop until we achieve it. Sincerity can move mountains, and we Chinese people dare to be confident that one day, the heroic spirit of our martyrs will soar into the sky and restore China, and there will finally be a year when the whole country celebrates with joy! Compatriots! Be invigorated, do not be discouraged; advance bravely, do not hesitate.</p>

<h3>Woman Has Another Lover - Paramour Attacks with Knife - Wounded in Vital Area - Life in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Mao Tangshi, a widow from Yangzhou, is thirty-seven years old this year. Her husband passed away years ago, and she is unaccustomed to sleeping alone. Recently, she has been having an affair with a man named Xiao Liu (the same age as her) from the same hometown. They have been secretly trysting for some time. They moved to the upper floor of the Sen Tai Fresh Rented Woodware Store at No. 108 Ximen Road in the French Concession. The relationship between Xiao Liu and her suddenly broke down, and they had a quarrel. Recently, Tangshi became involved in adultery with a certain Jia, who resided at No. 6 Zhixiang Li on the same road in the French Concession. The affair was discovered by Xiao Liu, who became consumed with jealousy and harbored the intention to kill her to vent his hatred. In the afternoon more than two days ago, Xiao Liu, carrying a foot-long sharp knife, rushed to her place, pushed open the door, and first engaged in a verbal dispute with Tangshi. The dispute escalated, and Xiao Liu immediately pulled out the sharp knife and stabbed Tangshi twice in the lower abdomen. Blood gushed out, and she fainted, falling to the floor in a pool of blood. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Xiao Liu abandoned the murder weapon and fled. Later, after a neighbor noticed it, they reported it to the French Concession police. The police immediately called an ambulance to rush to the scene and took her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Because the wound was in a vital area, and she lost a lot of blood, her condition was very serious, and her life was in danger. The police dispatched detectives to investigate, recovered the murder weapon, and took it back to the police station to report to the chief, who ordered all detectives to search for the fleeing suspect Xiao Liu to bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Japanese Sailor Murder Case on Haining Road - Suspect Interrogated Yesterday - Chinese and Japanese Witnesses Identify Assailant as Wearing Western Suit - Zhang Ronghe Detained for Picking Up Gun to Claim Reward - Judge to Visit Crime Scene on Set Date</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd of last month, a Japanese sailor, Asao Mitaharu, was shot dead near Lane 15, Wusong Road, Haining Road. At the same time, Japanese sailors Yoshitane Yawata and Zokuraide Rie also suffered gunshot wounds. The Japanese Marine Corps subsequently arrested three people: Zhang Ronghe, a congee vendor, and Ma Yongcai and Ma Yongnian. They were handed over to the First Special Court by the Hongkou Police Station. Except for the two Mas, who were released because they were not suspects, Zhang Ronghe was suspected of being more involved and was still detained. This case was heard yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. by Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special Court, along with Prosecutor Song Genshan and Clerk Wang Lanping, in the First Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Continued Interrogation</p>
<p>The lawyer representing the police station was Ru Baoyi and Zhang Shizhu, while the Japanese military headquarters was represented by more than ten Marine Corps soldiers who came to court. First, the police station's lawyer Zhang stated that the defendant Zhang Ronghe had now confessed to the police station that after hearing the gunshots on that day, he went to the scene and kicked over an object seven feet away from Lane 15 from west to east. Upon inspection, it turned out to be a handgun. At the time, he put it in a sand bin and was immediately arrested. According to him, the reason he hid the gun in the bin was to report it to the police afterwards and hope to get a considerable reward. Therefore, the police station is now prosecuting him for the crime of destroying evidence under Article 165 of the Criminal Law. It also stated that in this case,</p>
<p>Many Witnesses</p>
<p>There are eleven people who did not witness the situation and have already written statements at the police station, so they can be exempted from interrogation. The witnesses to be presented today, the Japanese Hoshita Yoshio, Yamanaka Toshige, Wakabayashi Hisaharu, Tanabe Jiro, Yoshida Sadao, and the Chinese Zhang Liangdou, all witnessed the situation. There are many other witnesses, but they are not important and will be interrogated later. The death and injury verification forms for Mitaharu, Yawata, and Rie have been issued by Japanese military doctors Yoshida Nagatake and Ogawa, and photographs have been taken. Photographs have also been taken of the situation at the scene of the incident.</p>
<p>Bullet Marks Remaining</p>
<p>on the wall at the scene of the incident. If the court deems it necessary to conduct an on-site inspection, please set a date to go and investigate. Although there are fingerprints on the handgun found in the sand bin, it is difficult to inspect because it has been handled by many people. The gun found in Xu Qingfang has been verified to be unrelated to this case, so it will not be presented. The nine bullet casings and one bullet found at the scene have been verified by the police station's experts to have been fired from the gun found in the sand bin. A report has been issued. All documents are hereby submitted for your inspection. Hoshita Yoshio then testified that after the incident, he saw a person with a deep yellow Western suit, five feet four or five inches tall, who was initially behind me, then passed me and came to my front. Not long after, I heard</p>
<p>Three Gunshots</p>
<p>After that, the person turned left from Beihaining Road and hired a rickshaw in front of a Japanese church and went towards North Sichuan Road, and then disappeared. Yamanaka Toshige did not arrive, so the Chinese Zhang Liangdou testified that he was a servant at a Korean house at No. 48 Beihaining Road. That evening, he saw two people wearing a yellow Western suit and a gray Western suit at the scene. They were initially walking in front of the four Japanese sailors. When they reached a telephone pole near the Shanghai Bank, they stopped. The four sailors passed them, and he immediately saw the person in yellow pull out a gun and fire two shots. I immediately fled back to my employer's house in Lane 15 and reported it to No. 65</p>
<p>Special Constable</p>
<p>MacGowan, who took his gun and chased after them. I don't know what happened after that. Wakabayashi Hisaharu testified that he saw a person in a Western suit run into Lane 15 after firing the gun, but he said that the person was wearing a green Western suit, which differed from the descriptions given by the two witnesses above. The court then ordered the three witnesses to identify the color of the clothing worn by the people in the audience as a reference for the future. After each made their identification, Tanabe Jiro testified that the assailant was two people, one wearing a gray Western suit and one wearing a black short suit. Yoshida Sadao also testified that one person in a Western suit ran into Lane 15 after firing the gun. Both of them identified the assailants as Chinese. The court then asked how they could distinguish that they were definitely Chinese since people of the East had the same skin color and wore Western suits. The two replied that they had their own</p>
<p>Ability to Distinguish</p>
<p>The court then questioned Zhang Ronghe. According to his statement, after I heard the gunshots, I went to the scene and kicked a gun on the road. At that time, I was extremely panicked. If I wanted to report it to the police immediately, I was afraid of being suspected of being the murderer, so I hid it in the sand bin in preparation for reporting it to the police later. Unexpectedly, as soon as I hid it, I was arrested by the Japanese. At first, I said that I wanted to get a reward, but later I said that I had no intention of getting a reward. The court then gave him the gun presented by the police station to read and see if it was the gun he had picked up and hidden at that time. Zhang replied</p>
<p>Generally Similar</p>
<p>The court said that Zhang had previously said that he suspected that his fellow villager Yu Changtai, who was setting up a dried rice stall, had been killed, so he went to visit him. Yu Changtai was summoned to the court. According to his statement, I set up a dried rice stall four or five feet away from the sand bin. When the incident happened, I went to make boiling water, so I didn't know anything. His wife, Ms. Li, also testified that she did not pay attention at the time, and when Zhang Ronghe came to ask me what happened, I replied that I didn't know. Later, I saw Zhang being arrested. At that time, someone bumped into me, but I didn't pay attention. After reviewing the confession, Judge Zhong instructed that the case be adjourned to the afternoon of the 23rd for further hearing, and another date be set to visit the scene of the incident.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Stolen Goods Found in Grass Shed on Zhongshan Road - Including Contraband Items Such as Bullets</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Criminal Investigation Division of the Nanshi 16th Section Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched team leaders Zhao Renxin and Wu Songshan, etc., and brought the captured offender Yao Huang to the Zhabei Xinzha Sub-bureau, claiming that a gang of thieves were hiding in a grass shed on Zhongshan Road. The bureau officers dispatched patrol officer Wang Kuizhang to assist in the investigation. As a result, a man named Tang Ruquan, the younger brother of Tang Fang, was caught, and the following items were seized: one pair of silver and jade earrings, three pieces of miscellaneous jade, forty-three rounds of White Langlin pistol bullets, two rounds of Mauser pistol bullets, five rounds of rifle bullets, 43 yuan in legal tender, 3 yuan and 6 jiao in corner tickets, four Bank of China exchange coupons, each worth 5 yuan, one counterfeit 5 yuan note from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, 22 yuan in silver dollars, one counterfeit 5 yuan silver dollar, 10 jiao in small silver coins, 7 jiao 5 fen in auxiliary coins, 3 jiao in old silver coins, one Han jade agate button, one genuine and one fake pearl flower. After being brought to the bureau, Tang Ruquan confessed that the above stolen goods were deposited by his brother with him, but he did not know where his brother was now. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, considering that the case was related to a gang of thieves, he ordered the suspect to be handed over to the officers to be taken away for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Using Fake Diploma from Japanese Medical School, Wang Jingbo Practiced Medicine in Shanghai for More Than Ten Years - Deceptively Obtained Registration Certificate from Health Department - Only Discovered and Arrested Recently</h3>
<p>Wang Jingbo, a native of Anhui, is 42 years old this year. He went to Japan to study medicine in 1919, for a total of 18 months. He returned to China in 1920 and returned to his hometown. The following year, he came to Shanghai, intending to practice medicine. However, because he had no medical knowledge and no graduation diploma from a medical specialty school, he was afraid of being attacked by colleagues and suppressed by the authorities. He entrusted a certain Zhang Zhengru to find a graduation certificate from Tokyo Medical School in Japan. He then deceptively obtained a registration certificate from the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Department and the Public Works Department Health Department. He then began to practice medicine and set up a clinic at No. 1568 Avenue Ingénieur Zietung, treating people's illnesses. More than ten years have passed since then, and the secret has never been revealed. Until May of this year, when Wang Jingbo applied to the Shanghai Municipal Health Department for a registration license, the Health Department discovered that Wang's diploma from Tokyo Medical School in Japan was suspicious. They reported it to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to Tokyo for investigation. It has now been reported that the diploma was indeed forged, so they requested the First Special Court to assist in the arrest for impersonating a doctor. The court signed an arrest warrant and issued it to the Xinzha Police Station. Around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Li Shizhong and Western Detective Kenai Tai went to arrest him. However, Jingbo had moved from Avenue Ingénieur Zietung to No. 7 Maoyili, Shanhai Pass Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest him and seized the fake diploma and the deceptively obtained health department license. They took him to the police station and detained him. Yesterday morning, Judge Chu Lin of the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court stated the above situation, and stated that since the defendant Wang Jingbo had been practicing medicine in the concession for a long time, whether there were any cases of malpractice causing death, the police station still needed to investigate, so he asked for permission to detain him. Wang hired three lawyers to the case, requesting bail to be allowed during the adjournment. Judge Lin ruled that bail was not allowed and approved the detention for seven days before further review.</p>
<p>Feelings About National Affairs</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Steamer Worker - A Young Woman Jumps into the Sea - Kang Wenjuan, 24 Years Old, Shanghai Native - Four Suicide Notes Lamenting the Imminent National Crisis</h3>
<p>The Ning Shao steamer of the Ning Shao Steamship Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 7th. That evening, a woman in blue, worried and angered about national affairs, committed suicide. The steamer returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. We took the following details.</p>
<p>Writing a Letter</p>
<p>The Ning Shao steamer sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5:00 p.m. on the 7th. That evening, a woman wearing a blue cloth cheongsam with short hair, resembling a student, also boarded the steamer in Cabin No. 37 to Ningbo, and was served by the steward Li Rende. After the steamer left the port, the woman was writing diligently at the table in the cabin. She had not stopped writing until around 10:00 p.m. The steward did not pay any attention to it. The next morning, when the steamer arrived at the Zhenhai pier, the woman was no longer in the cabin, leaving behind only a handbag and four suicide notes.</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea in the Dark</p>
<p>At that time, Li Rende, the steward in charge of the cabin, searched the entire steamer for her without success. When he asked another passenger in the same cabin (this passenger was a father and daughter), he learned that the woman had left the cabin at 11:00 p.m. after finishing writing the letters, and had not returned. The steward knew something was wrong and sent the handbag and the four suicide notes to the accounting room for inspection. Only then did they know that she had committed suicide by jumping into the river. It was speculated that the location of her jumping into the river was between Wai Tongsha and Da Ji Yang.</p>
<p>Suicide Notes of Sorrow and Anger</p>
<p>There were four suicide notes, one to her parents, one to her friend Ms. Fang Ying, one to her brothers and sisters in the country, and one to the steamer's owner. The letter to her parents stated that she was unable to support herself and was ashamed to rely on her parents. The letter to her friend and brothers and sisters in the country stated that she was worried and angered about the imminent national crisis and felt it was better to die early to avoid more regret. The letter to the shipowner asked him to distribute the above letters.</p>
<p>Items to be Claimed</p>
<p>All the letters were signed Kang Wenjuan, and her age of 24 was noted. She was a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang, and had studied at a certain school in Shanghai. When her handbag was opened, there were also 2 yuan and 6 jiao in national currency, some scattered copper coins, a photo of the deceased, and two fountain pens. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday who interviewed Mr. Li Ruiting, the purser of the steamer, since the above suicide notes did not specify addresses, there was no way to deliver them. The steamer decided to hand them over to the Ningbo branch for safekeeping and to wait for them to be claimed when it arrived in Ningbo.</p>
<h3>National Cartoon Exhibition Postponed</h3>
<p>The National Cartoon Exhibition, after several meetings, was originally scheduled to open on Double Tenth Day. According to reports, the delay is due to the late arrival of works from cartoonists in this city and the excessive time required for mounting and framing. Furthermore, the Da Xin venue was not available, making it difficult to hold the exhibition as scheduled. It is reported that the organizers decided yesterday to postpone the opening until a date between the 20th of this month and the end of the month, with no further postponement. It is also reported that all the works have been reviewed, with over two hundred selected as outstanding, according to sources.</p>

<p>Era Medicine: Spousal Knowledge</p>
<p>"Intimate Sexuality between Couples!" by Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of Ben Xue Weni University in America</p>
<p>...Sexual life is the foundation of marital harmony; incomplete sexuality is a disease; love does not last forever...Excessive masturbation in childhood and indulgence after marriage are not rational sexual behavior...Premature ejaculation and impotence are devils that disrupt happy families and must be treated early.</p>
<p>In society, it is common to see cold relationships and disagreements between couples. For example, husbands indulge in prostitution and wives, unable to endure loneliness, seek new lovers...Such irrational and deformed marital lives are often heard of in newspapers or through friends. Originally, the union of husband and wife should be beautiful and intoxicating, but why does it lead to such bad results? The reasons are varied, but the main one is caused by sexual barriers between couples. The foundation of marital life lies in healthy sexual love; if this ability is lost, no matter how happy or comfortable other circumstances may be, the family will still not be happy, and a tomb-like feeling of coldness can arise.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, sexual barriers must be considered the main cause of broken love between couples. But the occurrence of sexual barriers, in men, is mostly caused by sexual neurasthenia. For example, excessive masturbation in childhood or excessive sexual intercourse after marriage are causes of sexual neurasthenia. Premature ejaculation, impotence, and spermatorrhea are all symptoms induced by the above causes.</p>
<p>In women, there are only two types: frigidity and anesthesia. In addition, years of infertility can also damage feelings. Because after infertility, husbands often seek new love, so couples, regardless of which side, if they discover the aforementioned symptoms, must seek appropriate treatment early.</p>
<p>Regarding its treatment methods, according to famous scholars worldwide, such as Professor Bigelow of the Columbia University Physiology Department, Moses, Professor of Physiology at the University of Berlin in Germany, and Picard of France, all unanimously recommend the excellent and genuine gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" because it can radically cure premature ejaculation and impotence in a short period. For women, it can regulate menstruation and supplement beauty. If suffering from spermatorrhea, treat it simultaneously with "Himei Tuo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets." Regarding the effectiveness of these two drugs, based on my years of experience, they are truly the authorities among all endocrine preparations and spermatorrhea remedies. They have long been recognized in the medical community in Europe and America. Therefore, after returning to China, I worked with infertile women (Editor's Note: Genuine "Gonadal Hormone" and "Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" are generally packaged in iron boxes. Be careful not to mistakenly purchase counterfeit products in paper boxes or bottles, which will harm the disease).</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Lecture</p>
<p>Co-edited by Dr. Yao Erchang and Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Clinic: 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>(1) Masturbation, Spermatorrhea, and Obstructed Development</p>
<p>Patient Gu Qingquan, 18 years old, from Chengdu, Sichuan, currently studying at a church school in this city, complained that he could not get rid of the bad habits of youth. At the age of 15, when he was developing, he liked to associate with the opposite sex, and his eyes were overwhelmed with obscene pictures. As a result, he became addicted to masturbation, which he practiced daily. Although he knew the harm, he wanted to quit but could not succeed due to a lack of willpower. On the contrary, it became more serious, and now it has turned into nocturnal emission without dreams. He ejaculates at night without any awareness and now suffers from insomnia, waist and back pain, and drowsiness in the morning. He has no interest in doing things, makes many mistakes, and is extremely neurasthenic, with a sallow complexion and thin physique, no longer as he used to be. He is now even more anxious because of the busy schoolwork, so he came for treatment. Current symptoms: Gonads show abnormalities, and the seminal vesicle is even more relaxed. Treatment method: Prescribe the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" to promote the health of the gonads, and take the genuine "Himei Tuo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" in iron boxes to stop seminal emission and calm the nerves. At the same time, remove the foreskin and apply electrotherapy. After five weeks of treatment, all diseases were suddenly cured, and all parts developed and grew larger, surpassing ordinary people.</p>
<p>(2) Early Marriage, Amenorrhea, and Permanent Infertility</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Chu Yusheng, 30 years old, from Wuxi, complained that he had been married for four years but had not had any children. He felt very lonely, and his parents were eager to have a grandson, which made him even more difficult. However, the reason for infertility may be that his sexual desire was very strong when he was young, leading to excessive indulgence, resulting in short sexual performance and premature ejaculation. His body was also obviously aging, so he suffered from kidney deficiency, waist and knee pain, and extreme weakness. Mrs. Chu also suffered from irregular menstruation, sometimes early and sometimes late, without any regularity, and even missed periods for two or three months. Her physique was weak beyond comparison. Current symptoms: Mr. Chu's gonads have aged and lack the nutrition of vitality, and his sexual nerves are even more sensitive. His wife's reproductive gland is purely abnormal in endocrine, so her menstrual cycle is difficult to regulate. Treatment method: In addition to taking the genuine "Gonadal Hormone" in iron boxes to nourish and strengthen the gonads, Mr. Chu also received electrotherapy. His wife took "Female Gonadal Hormone" to regulate menstruation and replenish the body. After three months of treatment, Mr. Chu's sexual performance recovered, and he also gained ten pounds in weight. He was even more capable and happy during sexual intercourse. His wife also had smooth and strong body, rosy complexion, and increased beauty. Four months later, he received a letter from Wuxi, saying that she was three months pregnant. This was all thanks to the doctor and the famous medicine, and the whole family was grateful. In particular, the happiness of their couple also relied on luck, and they will never forget it.</p>
<p>Cure for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Jing of Shen Yulong Grocery Store, North Street, Haimen, Zhejiang, wrote that his wife was weak and sickly, especially suffering from severe leukorrhea, which had been treated repeatedly without success. The lower part of her body had an extremely foul odor and was unclean all year round, causing her great pain. Later, thanks to the introduction of his neighbor Mr. Fang Hanming, he purchased three boxes each of "Leukorrhea Cure" and "Female Gonadal Hormone" from Shenyao Meiyao Pharmacy. Now they have been used up, and the leukorrhea is gone, and the body is strong.</p>
<p>Quick Relief from Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Tingfang, 720 Yuanfang Road, this city, wrote that he had been suffering from stomach pain for nearly thirty years, with extreme pain, but had not found a good medicine to treat it. Four months ago, his young son suddenly bought "Gastrointestinal Health Tablets" and "Stomach Pain Relief Tablets," saying they were very effective. He was hesitant because he was afraid of being fooled by inferior drugs again, but after taking them, he saw miraculous effects. Now he has been cured and has not had pain again. He did not expect that an old man of sixty could regain his health, and the effective medicine is truly worth recommending.</p>
<p>Incomplete Development</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Chengzhang, 6 East Street, Luoyang City, Henan, wrote that he is 26 years old this year. Ten years ago, he committed the bad habit of masturbation, causing his development to be hindered. Until last winter, he was still like a child. Later, with the introduction of a friend, he took "Gonadal Hormone" internally. After two months, all parts of his development had abnormal progress. Until now, he is no different from ordinary people, and even surpasses them, truly a rare and sacred medicine.</p>
<p>Impotence and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Songshuo of Lin Yijia Chun Restaurant, Guangzhou, wrote that his couple had been married for ten years, but had not found a medicine for true love. Because he suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence, and his wife also had irregular menstruation, their life was devoid of interest. This spring, his relative Mr. Liang came from Shanghai, bringing half a dozen each of "Male and Female Gonadal Hormone." After his couple took them, all their ailments were cured, and their love was even better than when they were newlyweds.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Medicine: An Analysis of the Harms of Youthful Self-Indulgence</p>
<p>Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>The harms of excessive masturbation in young people are: easy fatigue, soreness in the legs, arms, and spine, a feeling of heavy pressure on the head, headaches, indigestion with bloating, back pain, insomnia, palpitations, and other symptoms. If frequent spermatorrhea occurs, then in addition to the above symptoms, there is also a feeling of local inability to control urination. Or two or three drops of urine drip out after urination, staining the underwear. Also, the urge to urinate arises before the urine has accumulated sufficiently. Inflammation invades the vas deferens (the exit of sperm), and spermatorrhea occurs. During this period, there is no pleasure during ejaculation. When the disease is severe, even a slight motive during the day can cause ejaculation. If no method is taken to cure it at this time, the body's nutrition will decline, the muscles will become thin, and health will lose its guarantee. All kinds of diseases will inevitably come together. From a medical standpoint, I offer a piece of advice to young people: To stop spermatorrhea, you must strengthen the seminal vesicle. Because after the seminal vesicle is strengthened, the mind will be clear and settled, and lascivious dreams at night can be reduced, and nocturnal emission can be stopped. According to world-renowned venereologists, such as British Medical Doctor David Clow, German venereal disease expert Herbert Gray, Russian Galliffe, and famous Roman Catholic doctor Dr. Leo T. Latz, regarding the treatment of spermatorrhea, in addition to spiritual cultivation, "Himei Tuo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" are the best. Taking this can strengthen the seminal vesicle and radically cure spermatorrhea. If suffering from neurasthenia and erectile dysfunction due to spermatorrhea, the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" should be used to remedy it, and the effect will be even more obvious.</p>
<p>Overseas Medical News: A Complete Picture of the Beauty and Ugliness of Girls' Breasts in Various Countries</p>
<p>Written by Dr. Zhang Junshi, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>...Western women's breasts are superior to those of Eastern women...Scientific remediation of unhealthy German women has yielded great results.</p>
<p>The issue of breast beauty is especially important for women. All the elements of female beauty are undoubtedly centered on breast development. The importance of breast development, according to Dr. Price, a famous German physiologist, is confirmed that women's breast development not only adds a bit of beauty, but also has a close relationship with women's lifelong health. If development is incomplete and the breasts are atrophied, then health will inevitably be lost.</p>
<p>According to the British "Beauty Magazine," "The topic of breast beauty is not only based on size. In terms of large breasts, women in Samoa, Cairo, and Annam in addition to European women are very large. Although their breasts are so large, they are not beautiful. Smaller breasts are not good, but too large are not necessarily beautiful. Because too large will fill the lower part of the chest and bury her curves. Look at the chests of Annam women to see if they are beautiful, and you will know."</p>
<p>This proves that the beauty of Western women's breasts is not in the size of the breasts, but in the high and firm bust, which is superior to Eastern women. Therefore, Western women's breasts can be said to be the most beautiful breasts in the world. Among them, the breasts of women in Paris, Sweden, Hungary, Austria, and Germany are the most praised by the general public. According to a recent survey: In 1933, there were a total of 59,654 women in Berlin with unhealthy breasts and infertility. The government believed that this hindered the promotion of eugenics policies, so it strictly ordered all hospitals in Berlin to treat them with the gonadal hormone preparation "Female Gonadal Hormone." By the end of June this year, a survey by the Berlin City Hall found that there were only 4,572 women in Berlin with unhealthy breasts and infertility. According to observations by medical experts, all of them can be cured within two years. From then on, there will be no weak women in Berlin. Germany's efforts in eugenics over the years have yielded results. The World Games this year prove that the strength of the German nation has ranked first in the world.</p>
<p>"Female Gonadal Hormone" is extracted from the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and testicles of strong male animals through careful and precise scientific methods. Its effect is to promote development, especially for women's hips and breasts, regulate menstruation, and if children are weak, taking this can produce healthy children, so it is especially a powerful remedy for infertile women. No wonder the German government has been rewarding it.</p>
<p>A Talk on Smoking Cessation: Discussing the Advantages of the Nourishing and Strengthening Smoking Cessation Method</p>
<p>Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Superior efficacy, unmatched by other methods. Safe and fast, praised by all those who quit smoking.</p>
<p>The five-year plan for the anti-drug movement is approaching, but most smokers are still hesitant and unwilling to completely quit smoking. Is it difficult for them to flout the law and treat national laws as child's play? I don't think there are such foolish people! According to my clinical experience, they are not unaware of the harm of smoking, but they cannot endure the various pains of quitting. Because they are addicted to smoking, nicotine has spread throughout their bodies, and they cannot stimulate their spirits without nicotine. Once they quit, they will feel weak and uneasy, suffer from insomnia and spermatorrhea, and experience symptoms such as back pain. Imagine, how can a smoker's weak body resist? No wonder they view quitting smoking as a daunting task. But since the implementation of the nourishing and strengthening smoking cessation method, smokers no longer need to worry about the above-mentioned pain. Moreover, the efficacy is superior, safe, and fast. Countless smokers around the world have relied on this to quit. The surgery is also very simple. Just take a large amount of the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" and inject "Yu Wei Si Bao Ming" to restore the original function of the gonads, generate a powerful antitoxin, and it is not difficult to quit quickly and without pain. There was once a Mr. Wu Guoting who came to me to quit smoking. I used the above-mentioned nourishing and strengthening method to help him quit. He completely quit in two months. Mr. Wu said: I have been smoking for 15 years and have quit several times, but always failed due to a lack of energy and lingering illnesses. This time, forced by the law, I was able to quit safely and without pain, which was unexpected. It is truly the happiness of those who quit smoking.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Bone Pain: A Clinical Experience...</p>
<p>The Secret to Treating Bone Pain</p>
<p>Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>You should enrich your knowledge of choosing medicine. You also need a good medicine that treats the root cause.</p>
<p>In the past, there was no suitable medicine for the treatment of bone pain. One reason was that doctors and pharmacists adhered to old methods and were unwilling to explore further. The second reason was that patients were not self-aware, thinking that it was not important. Even middle-aged and young people suffered from bone pain. After sitting for a long time, working, walking long distances, in wet weather, or during seasonal changes, they would feel pain in the bones and joints, and numbness in the limbs, even unable to move, like paralysis, suffering a lot. Recently, Dr. Johnson, a medical doctor in the United States, invented a sacred medicine for bone pain called "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets." Because of its proven effectiveness, it is praised as an amazing sacred medicine. There was a Lu Zhongqiu, 42 years old, who had worked hard all his life, and had also been promiscuous when he was young, suffering from venereal disease. As a result, he suffered from bone pain due to the combination of dampness and toxins for more than ten years. He sought medical treatment and divination, spending a lot of money, but the bone pain was still not cured. This spring, after I instructed him to use "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets," he was completely cured in less than two months. He has not relapsed in half a year, and is stronger than before.</p>

<p>The troubles of those with gonorrhea are of course indescribably painful. Therefore, people often ask me: "Can my gonorrhea be cured? When will it be cured?"</p>
<p>Most of these people are young people who want to get married, so this is a very important issue, not only related to themselves, but also to their future wives and children. For these reasons, the treatment methods for gonorrhea must be improved quickly to avoid harming innocent wives.</p>
<p>In 1933, world-renowned gonorrhea scholars, such as Dr. Muller, Dr. Ferguson, and American venereal disease expert Price, confirmed that the patient's recuperation is the most important. For diet, avoid eating irritating foods such as sour, spicy, wine, vinegar, and cigarettes. In addition, for drug therapy, "Antilin," a combination of yellow pigment and a vaccine, is the most reliable. It can not only cure radically early, but also has no side effects. When I was in England, famous doctors there unanimously praised the efficacy of this combination preparation. After returning to China, I have seen the drug welcomed and adopted by the Chinese medical community. Therefore, I often use it as the main drug for treating gonorrhea, radically curing many gonorrhea patients, at least 6,000 people a year. Its proven effectiveness is unmatched by any gonorrhea drug.</p>

<p>Major Players Watch from the Sidelines, Gold Auction Prices Struggle to Rise</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday struggled to rise due to the lack of activity from major players, lacked support, and turned weak. The silver market was also loose. The all-day market, although weak, was still flat. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America were flat, and the forward silver price in Mondry did not change. Exchange rates opened flat and closed higher. The London spot gold price rose three pence.

Scattered buying collapsed, and continued to go downstream, but there was still much support after the low, because the difference from the standard was not much. The afternoon close was still stable. The afternoon market was still flat, but because the exchange rate market hardened, there was still more supply and continued weakness. However, with low activity from buyers, it was still easy to pull up. The Indian silver price increased by three annas twice, and coupled with the closure, there was still much selling. The final trend was still difficult to be optimistic about. The all-day market situation is recorded as follows:</p>

Tianjin goods were quoted at 13.7 yuan extra. Hechi's buying price was 12 yuan, but there was no transaction. Hechi's selling price was 16.5 to 17 yuan, with more than 400 taels sold by Shengyuanyong and more than 100 taels sold by Dafengheng, bought by pawnshops and outsiders. Spot exchange for November futures, 49 gold bars were transferred from Futaiheng to Yuanyong, with only six jiao in subsidies.</p>
<p>In-market transactions were normal. Qiafengyong Dingkang Tongfengheng Hengyu Shengyuanyong Jinfengyong Futaiheng Jiuda Hengchangyong and others were on the buying side.

The total number of transactions was 1,198 gold bars in the morning market and 490 gold bars in the afternoon market.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: British Tight, American Loose</p>
<p>The exchange rate market yesterday closed slightly higher, causing the British rate to be tight and the American rate to be hard during the process. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that the London bulk rates were flat for both near and forward dates. The New York silver market was unchanged.

<p>Special National Day Issue of Shen Bao Commemorative Essay: National Crisis and National Day</p>
<p>By Huan Yu</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>The national crisis is too severe, so even though we are celebrating the National Day holiday, we seem unable to muster the enthusiasm to celebrate. Most people probably think this way: in such a situation, even if we celebrate for appearances' sake, it would only be "forced smiles," what's the point! In fact, precisely because the national crisis is so severe, we must celebrate the National Day holiday. Forced smiles may well be enough to stimulate a mood of "striving for self-improvement"; being purely sad is unreasonable!</p>
<p>The so-called national crisis and the so-called National Day are both based on the people's concept of the nation. If the people's concept of the nation is very weak, then even if there is a severe national crisis, they will not feel much grief; even if the National Day arrives, they will not think of celebrating.</p>
<p>The people's concept of the nation is not innate but is created by the environment. The commemoration of national crises and National Day are both excellent opportunities to remind people of the concept of the nation.</p>
<p>The word "nation," although a common noun belonging to a countable collective, is intangible and has no real substance, almost a virtual name. Therefore, talking about the nation to naive people is often incomprehensible. They only know "to work when the sun rises, to rest when the sun sets, to dig wells and drink, to till fields and eat," and they are completely ignorant of the existence of the nation, truly what is called "What has the Emperor's power to do with me!"</p>
<p>The nation has a great function, which is "to resist foreign insults." This function is not easily felt in peacetime, so the naive people feel about the nation is "What has the Emperor's power to do with me!" Once encountering foreign insults, this function becomes very obvious. People who once thought "What has the Emperor's power to do with me!" are all stimulated by foreign insults to recognize the existence of the nation and feel the need to maintain the nation's existence.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, everyone has felt that the people's concept of the nation in our country has become more and more widespread day by day. As a result of successive incidents thereafter, although our country's land and sovereignty have suffered many losses, and our people have suffered many direct or indirect pains, the lessons of such a severe national crisis have already made it a very powerful undercurrent that cannot be eliminated by any power or conspiracy. Those attempts to curb it with power and conspiracy are not only futile but may also create an opportunity for this undercurrent to turn into a climax. Therefore, we do not need to be purely sad because of the severity of the national crisis. We should grit our teeth, endure all kinds of hardships, and bravely move forward in this powerful undercurrent.</p>
<p>Moving forward requires considerable courage. Courage is not false pride, and of course, it cannot be created overnight. It must be cultivated through practical actions accumulated over time. Our environment and the facts we encounter are already sufficient to cultivate the courage we need. Due to the pressure of external forces, we are in a situation where we must advance and cannot retreat. Everyone feels that there is no way out without mustering the courage to move forward. However, given the appropriate opportunity, we should also encourage everyone's courage. Celebrating National Day must be an extremely appropriate opportunity. Celebrating National Day has the effect of cultivating the people's concept of the nation. Taking this opportunity to encourage the people's courage to move forward is truly extremely appropriate.</p>
<p>Celebrating National Day seems to only encourage prosperity, but it is not entirely true. Celebrating National Day in times of prosperity is as if fearing that the people will indulge in the atmosphere of "What has the Emperor's power to do with me," and teaching everyone not to abandon the concept of the nation. Celebrating National Day in times of severe national crisis is to make people more certain of their national concept during the growth of their national concept by commemorating the birth of the nation. Its role is actually more important than in times of prosperity.</p>
<p>The content of the national concept is not simple, and there are several key points that scholars have debated endlessly throughout history. Therefore, how the people develop their national concept and work hard for the nation is also not a simple matter; in today's situation where the national crisis is so severe, how the people accept the lessons of the national crisis and work hard for the nation is especially not a simple matter. I think the most suitable national concept should be based on historical lessons. We should deal with the national crisis based on historical lessons, and we should know that National Day is a memorable day in the process of resolving the national crisis. Celebrating National Day in times of severe national crisis is a good time to carefully review the historical lessons related to this commemorative day, address the current national crisis, and determine the strategy for our efforts.</p>
<p>The most important significance of celebrating National Day is to commemorate the martyrs and to review the historical experiences related to this commemorative day. Although the achievements of the Xinhai Revolution were not thorough, the difficulties and hardships of the martyrs in creating the Republic of China are still worth commemorating. "Climbing high starts from the low ground, and traveling far starts from the near." We must not ignore the preliminary work of our predecessors. We must know that the creation of the Republic of China was entirely dependent on the pioneering spirit of the martyrs. This spirit is what our people need most to deal with the current national crisis.</p>
<p>However, as we move forward on the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, we still need to review the lessons of failure left by the martyrs. Turning through our country's modern history, we can know that the Xinhai Revolution was a reaction to the successive aggressions of the powers such as the Opium War and the Sino-Japanese War. And that revolution, although created by the blood of the martyrs, was not thorough. We should carefully examine the reasons why it was not thorough. This kind of historical lesson is very precious. We should savor it at any time and any place, so that we can find our own path of effort and complete the unfinished work of the martyrs.</p>
<p>In this severe national crisis, when our compatriots are "forcing a smile" to celebrate this National Day holiday, let us ponder the hard work of the martyrs and the historical lessons they left behind. This will be beneficial to our struggle for national liberation to some extent.</p>
<h3>Double Tenth Reflections</h3>
<p>By Wu Kaisheng</p>
<p>The annual Double Tenth Festival, in the past, during the period when warlords were divided and rampant, was used as a tool to embellish peace, so there was nothing to celebrate. After the establishment of the National Government, it should have swept away the haze of the National Day in the past. However, just as the country was initially stabilized and construction had not yet begun, the September 18th Incident of the twentieth year of the Republic broke out, the golden goblet was broken, what was there to celebrate? Since then, the national crisis has become more and more serious, and we cannot even embellish peace even if we want to. Until this year, with regard to domestic affairs, all construction projects have gradually begun to develop, and the great cause of true unification has also been declared a success. This should be something for the people of the country to be happy and encouraged about. However, due to the rapid and continuous occurrence of unfortunate incidents in foreign relations, Sino-Japanese diplomacy has suddenly become tense, and the whole country is worried, with a great sense of impending storm. And the actions of the Japanese army in various places in Hongkou and Zhabei have made people even more fearful and uneasy. Because of this, the Double Tenth National Day will not be able to pass peacefully again. If I am asked to write reflections, where should I start?</p>
<p>Now, Sino-Japanese diplomacy has reached its most serious and final stage. The Japanese view it this way, and the Chinese also view it this way. We will discuss this issue in order to be different from the boring texts that are routinely followed every year. We believe it will be welcome to the people of both China and Japan.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Japan, from a vertical perspective, shares the same culture and the same race, so it is a brotherly country; from a horizontal perspective, the countries face each other across the sea, and their interests are connected. They have always been the major land and water powers of East Asia, so they are countries as close as lips and teeth. However, it is unfortunate that incidents such as the September 18th and January 28th Incidents have occurred, which have greatly damaged the feelings and prestige of the Chinese people. It is also unfortunate that there have been too many misunderstandings between the two countries, and the tendency to blame one side has only made the knot deeper and deeper, leading to the unfortunate state of tension today. We do not need to study where the responsibility for creating this state lies, but rather, we should analyze the relationship between the interests of the two countries with a sincere attitude and present it to the people of both countries.</p>
<p>Until the Chengdu Incident occurred, Sino-Japanese diplomacy was in the stage of adjusting diplomatic relations, and the authorities of both countries were also working hard on this. However, continuous unfortunate events hindered it, making the future treacherous. How to break this sad situation, we firmly believe that the first principle should be to resolve it through diplomatic means, and should not be stupidly exercising force at will, causing both sides to suffer and be taken advantage of by others. It is important to know that the situation in the world today has reached an extremely serious stage. In Europe, there is already the Spanish Civil War and the so-called People's Front stirring up the struggle between international autocracy and international conflict. Crises are everywhere, and countries are preparing to fight each other. Its turbulent situation is enough to shake world peace with surplus energy. Moreover, who is not watching covetously, willing to choose the fat and eat it, and develop outward? If Sino-Japanese relations, unfortunately, the path to diplomatic resolution is exhausted, and the two countries launch a war before Europe, we believe that Japan's military force is absolutely not enough to eliminate the entire China. At most, China will be devastated, and Japan may not be able to remain intact. The scourge of war will continue, and the two countries will not stop until they have mutually eliminated each other's national strength. Even if Japan is sufficient to eliminate China, before Japan has the time to occupy China, other countries will take advantage of Japan's weakness. This is known to the people of Japan who are of the same view. As for China, its diplomatic policy has long been determined, that is, "Never give up peace until peace has reached the point of despair, and never lightly talk about sacrifice until sacrifice has reached the final moment." As for its limit, the principle is not to harm the integrity of our country's territory and sovereignty. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will persevere with forbearance, not be aroused by emotions, not be tempted by reactionary elements, and not indulge in the small anger of individuals, causing difficulties for the government authorities to negotiate and destroying the overall situation of integrity. Wait until the gradual completion of various administrative and construction projects, then the foundation will be solid, and what can be impossible to achieve?</p>
<p>The above is on both sides. We will abandon the subjective view of Sino-Japanese relations, and only speak from the point of view of interests. China is a continental country, and Japan is a maritime country. One is lagging in the agricultural era, and the other has considerable development in industry and commerce. Separated by a sea, a reed can be sailed. Japan should recognize that the revival of China is not only a blessing for China, but it is also more beneficial to Japan than to any country in Europe and America. If China cannot revive one day, then its period of social prosperity will be more difficult to achieve. Gradually, as in today's bankrupt rural economy, social industries are declining, and the people's living energy is falling below the standard, let alone their purchasing power. With a market with no purchasing power, is it beneficial to the Japanese? Or is it unprofitable? This point of interest is extremely obvious, and the reason is extremely simple. Does it require a wise man to see it? On the contrary, if China can revive as soon as possible, its own wealth will be strong, and its indirect and direct contributions to the world will also be strong. Japan and China are brotherly countries. As the saying goes, "The pavilion near the water gets the moon first." Then Japan's revival of China will definitely bring great profits to Japan's industry and commerce, and Japan's industrial and commercial circles will never have to worry about the way out for goods. Why should we be reckless and regret it when it is too late, and lift up half of the East Asian continent and throw it into the abyss together?</p>
<p>Today is the final period for both countries to suddenly wake up. China is willing to sincerely seek a way to improve relations under a rational solution. On the Japanese side, it should not exaggerate and continue to press forward, always seeking a diplomatic way out from a well-intentioned position to break the current deadlock. Mr. Kuwajima has already brought his important instructions to assist Ambassador Kawagoe in meeting with our country's diplomatic authorities. Then, how will the so-called common opinion of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries be expressed? Mutual destruction? Or friendship between the two countries? The development of the future depends entirely on this. We sincerely hope that the Japanese side can also be as calm and peaceful as we are and not go beyond the usual boundaries. Otherwise, we in China have been waiting for the arrival of doom for a long time. I wonder if our friendly countries have the same fear? On this National Day, I sincerely hope that there will be a happy development between China and Japan!</p>
<h3>An Outline of National Economic Construction</h3>
<p>By Zhang Baiyi</p>
<p>Economy in a broad sense is life. The sole purpose of national economic construction is to maintain the people's livelihood. At present, our country's people do not know how to use their own living resources to maintain their own lives, but instead allow others to use and enjoy our living resources. Hunger and poverty dominate the lives of our country's people.</p>
<p>Based on the needs of the objective environment, China's national economic construction is urgently needed. Whether it is to recover the lost living resources or to ensure the unlost living resources, everyone must quickly work hard on national economic construction!</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about this issue in four parts. These four parts are the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation that are commonly said.</p>
<p>Clothing Aspect</p>
<p>Clothing is a necessity for the people's livelihood, but the country's production volume is not enough to meet the people's consumption volume, and a huge amount of foreign goods are imported every year. According to the recent trade figures report for the first half of the 25th year of the Republic, we can find that the import of clothing products is very large, such as cotton cloth, which accounts for 2.82 million gold units, cotton textiles, 500,000 gold units, hemp textiles, 2.94 million gold units, wool textiles, 1.35 million gold units, cotton, 10.98 million gold units, cotton yarn, 380,000 gold units, hemp, 760,000 gold units, wool, 3.36 million gold units, coarse and fine flannel money, 500,000 gold units, rayon, 970,000 gold units, raw and tanned leather, etc., 1.06 million gold units, totaling 25.63 million gold units in the import value of clothing products in half a year. Each gold unit is equivalent to 2 yuan and 24 cents of national currency, which is 57.41 million yuan, accounting for 12.60% of the total import amount. If the second half of the year is in the same tone as the first half of the year, then the total value of clothing products supplied by foreign countries throughout the year will be 114.82 million yuan.</p>
<p>However, can't China's clothing industry be self-sufficient? The facts tell us: the production volume of cotton textiles is sufficient for self-sufficiency, but the production of cotton is still insufficient, but it can be increased. The wool textile industry has not reached a developed state. Although the quality of Chinese wool is not good, it can still be replanted, and the export of wool is very large. Therefore, if domestic wool is processed, it can still be used as the raw material for the wool textile industry. There is no problem with the self-sufficiency of silk textiles. The raw materials for rayon are abundant in the country. We only need to look forward to the establishment of the rayon industry; China was originally a producer of leather goods, etc., but unfortunately, the industrial equipment for refining leather goods in the country is too small! From this, it can be seen that China's clothing resources are quite rich. Although cotton is insufficient, it is listed as the third-class cotton-producing country in the world. Why does China still need to buy 100 million yuan of clothing products from foreign countries every year? If the combination of technology and capital creates a new industry, then China's clothing can be self-sufficient without any problems. The construction and improvement plans of various departments in the clothing field are described as follows.</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles: First, let's talk about cotton, the raw material for cotton textiles: China's cotton is still not self-sufficient. In the first half of the 25th year of the Republic, there was a cotton import surplus of 14 million yuan. Moreover, cotton is also the main raw material for military gunpowder during wartime. Therefore, whether from an economic or military point of view, self-sufficiency must be the principle. To solve the problem of insufficient cotton, one is to make use of burial grounds and wasteland to increase the area planted, the second is to universally change to planting American varieties to reduce waste during weaving, and the third is to plant scientifically, such as applying fertilizer, to increase the harvest. From the perspective of the cotton textile industry: China's cotton textile factories have developed considerably, so the problem is not the lack of production and quantity of cotton textiles, but the fact that the domestic cotton textile market is being seized by foreign countries. The reason why foreign countries can seize the Chinese market is because of their low-price dumping and the special advantages of establishing factories in China. Therefore, China's cotton textiles are not insufficient to supply the needs of the domestic market. To solve this problem, the most likely way is for the Chinese people to passively not use foreign goods, and at the same time, when factories in China such as Hua Mian are able to be self-sufficient, they must supply the market at low prices.</p>
<p>Wool Textiles: The wool currently used in China's wool textile industry is all foreign wool. In the first half of this year, the import of wool reached 7.53 million yuan. However, at the same time, China's export of wool in the same period also reached 8.45 million yuan, which shows that China's tenth wool, if scientifically processed, can still be used to weave clothing products. Unfortunately, China lacks this technology. Although China does not value its own wool, it has been valued by others. Since the replanting of Northeast wool, the results have been great. Foreign varieties besides</p>
<h3>Struggle of Those Who Peddle Leftovers: Leaders of Two Gangs Fail to Negotiate Peace; Gao Liansheng Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>In the Yulin Road and Huade Road area, there were unscrupulous Ningbo gangs who made a living by peddling leftovers, led by Little White Eyes and Little Black Coal. The Shandong gang was headed by Gao Liansheng (26 years old), each dominating their own territory. Each had many followers. Recently, Little White Eyes discussed with Gao, saying that the situation in Zhabei was chaotic recently, and many residents were moving. Our two gangs often argue over the leftover business. Now is a good opportunity to make peace, become sworn brothers, and go to Zhabei to rob and divide the spoils. Unexpectedly, Gao refused and used abusive language, which angered Little White Eyes and Little Black Coal. They immediately gathered their followers at the Sanxing Teahouse on Yuanfang Road to discuss the matter and notified Gao Shusheng of the Shandong gang. If they didn't agree, they would negotiate near Huade Road and Qiwupu Road at 11 pm the night before. Gao was not afraid either. At the appointed time, each invited dozens of people with knives and sticks, waiting at the designated location. They started fighting as soon as they disagreed. As a result, Gao Shusheng was stabbed in a vital area and fell to the ground. Jin Guanya, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road police station, and Chinese constables No. 2486 and No. 2437, arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested Ningbo natives Lu Shifa, Shandong natives Wang Songting, and Gao Lianming. Wang and Gao were also injured in the head and back by iron bars. A broadsword and a wooden stick with iron nails were found on the ground. The seriously injured Gao Liansheng was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment but died. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Lu Caifa, Wang Songting, and Gao Lianming were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case. Then, the detective reported the course of events and presented the murder weapons for inspection. Judge Xiao Xiebin questioned the three defendants, but their confessions were evasive. He ordered them to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for further investigation. Tang, the prosecutor from the court, went to the morgue to examine Gao Shusheng's body and determined that the deceased, Gao Shusheng, male, had died from stab wounds sustained before death. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for coffin storage. The escaped criminals in this case should be investigated and arrested by the responsible police station.</p>
<h3>Public Association Certification and Registration; Ministry of Industry Agrees to Consider as Reference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a proposal by the Design Committee to the Ministry of Industry, stating that supplementary measures should be formulated for the registration of companies and firms in the future, requiring the submission of certification documents from public associations for review. The Ministry's reply stated, "Received and understood. The opinions presented shall be kept for reference." This concludes the response.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Deals Cautiously with Liability in Maritime Accidents; Organizing an Examination Committee</h3>
<p>The shipping company's handling of maritime accidents typically begins by determining the liability of senior sailors as the starting point for resolving the incident. Recently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that the determination of this liability has a significant impact on the promotion and demotion of the sailors themselves. It should be handled meticulously, providing senior sailors with an opportunity to defend themselves, and maintaining a fair principle, in order to convince people and conform to the facts. It is heard that they have begun organizing a Senior Sailors' Maritime Accident Liability Examination Committee and stipulating that when such incidents occur in the future, the committee should deliberate and decide, and submit it to the general manager for approval and implementation. It is heard that four senior staff members have been appointed as members, and a captain will be temporarily appointed to participate in the meeting when it is convened in the future.</p>
<h3>Wang Qishan Smuggles Artificial Silk; Local Court Opens Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Qishan from Taizhou, 46 years old, runs the Fuxing Noodle Shop on Yangshupu Road. Last month, he colluded with others to engage in the smuggling of artificial silk. On the night of September 3rd, he carried five bags of artificial silk smuggled from the Italian ship "Taili" at the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong, disguised as flour, and hired a boat to cross the river. He was suspected by Yi Shaoshan, the police chief of the water patrol team, and police officer Huang Yutang, who questioned him. Wang Qishan bribed them with 40 yuan. Chief Yi was afraid of causing an accident due to being outnumbered, so he ordered the police officer to monitor and urgently reported to Deputy Captain Li Tingzhong. Wang dared to throw the stolen goods into the river again and offered another bribe, so he was immediately arrested and sent to the water patrol team, and then to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the local court. The prosecutor prosecuted him according to Article 222, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Li questioned the defendant, who stubbornly denied the charges. After Police Officer Yi testified, the judge ordered a further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>China Tea Industry Association; First Annual Meeting Opens Tomorrow; Members from Various Places Arrive in Shanghai One After Another; The General Meeting May Be Postponed for Two Days</h3>

<h3>Commemorative Stamps; Released Today; Four Different Designs and Colors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration and its affiliated branches will begin selling commemorative stamps for the 40th anniversary of the postal service's opening at 9:00 am today.</p>
<p>Four Different Designs</p>
<p>The commemorative stamps are divided into four denominations: 2 cents (featuring an airplane and mountains), 5 cents (featuring a ship), 25 cents (featuring the Shanghai Postal Administration), and 1 yuan (featuring the Nanjing Postal Headquarters Building). The total cost of the full set is 1.32 yuan (courtesy of Datong News Agency).</p>
<p>The commemorative stamps are all printed by the Ministry of Finance's Printing and Minting Bureau, and their four colors are different. The stamps all feature the words "Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Opening of the China Post Office," which are clear and beautiful. The area is slightly larger than ordinary stamps, making them rectangular.</p>
<p>Period of Sale and Use</p>
<p>For the convenience of stamp collectors, a commemorative booklet with three pages has been printed to paste these commemorative stamps. Stamp collectors can also request the post office to stamp the date. The sale date is set for six months, from the Double Ten Festival to the end of March next year. The usage period is set to end at the end of June next year. Within three months after the expiration of the usage period, the stamps can still be exchanged for ordinary stamps of the same value at the post office.</p>
<p>Sales Begin Today</p>
<p>The General Affairs Office on the second floor of the bureau and the branches in this city will all begin selling these commemorative stamps from today. However, today is the Double Ten National Day, so the sales hours for the Administration Bureau are from 9:00 am to 10:00 am, 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, and 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm. The sales hours for the branches are also from 9:00 am to 10:00 am, 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm, and 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Stamp collectors who purchase stamps from 9:00 am to 10:00 am can also have the post office stamp "October 10th Hour" to increase the commemorative value.</p>
<h3>Transferred from Tianjin by Plane to Shanghai; A Famous French Writer; Detained for a Fake Passport; Named Groke Claude</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the foreigner who was escorted to Shanghai by a China Aviation Corporation plane on Monday (5th) of this week is Mr. Groke Claude, a 50-year-old French writer and expert on the Far East. Because the French Consulate in this city does not have a suitable prison to detain French criminals, he is temporarily being held in the Xizha Road Prison. This person is not related to the late Mr. Shi Tai's drug trafficking case. The French Consulate in this city received a tip last week that Mr. Groke had a fake passport, so they immediately telegraphed the French Embassy in Peiping to find him, search him, and discovered a fake passport in addition to the real passport. He was then escorted to Tianjin and handed over to a French police officer, who escorted him by plane to Shanghai. According to Mr. Groke, he has often been to China in the past six years. This time, he arrived in Shanghai two months ago via Haiphong and Hong Kong, stayed for a few weeks, and then went to Peiping, apparently to collect materials for a new book. Mr. Groke has written many books about the Far East, is proficient in the Vietnamese language, and is familiar with Eastern politics and economics, so people regard him as an authority on the East. Since Mr. Groke is a well-known figure, why does he have a fake passport? The French Consulate is currently conducting a thorough investigation and is unwilling to disclose the truth of the case. According to French criminal law, the crime committed by Mr. Groke can be punished with imprisonment for six months to three years. It is heard that Mr. Puri Mei, a lawyer in this city, has been hired to defend him.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that Mr. Groke Claude was questioned by Mr. Kaufman, the president of the French court in this city, this morning (9th). After asking for a brief statement, he adjourned the court at 11:30. Mr. Groke was still returned to the Xizha Road Prison. Officials from the court and the French Consulate will meet this afternoon to discuss the case. The court will reopen for further trial after a final decision is made.</p>
<h3>Large Fish Market Auction Market Completed and Opened This Morning; The Entire Market is Well-Built and Large in Scale; The Original Auction Market Will Be Renovated</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry began operations in May of this year and has achieved satisfactory results. Now, the newly built large auction market has also been completed and will begin fish product transactions this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Completed</p>
<p>When the Jiaoshi Market opened, the original auction market was located south of the market office building, along the banks of the Huangpu River, which was very convenient for transporting fish. However, due to the development of the business, it was necessary to expand. Therefore, more than 30,000 yuan was allocated last month to build a large auction market in the west of the market. The construction was undertaken by the Xi Zhiji Engineering Office and was completed in one month. Then, water and electricity projects were installed, and the work was completely completed at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>Trading This Morning</p>
<p>The Fish Market is scheduled to start operations today, Double Ten Festival. River fish brokers, sea fish brokers, and other fishermen and vendors in the market have been notified to enter the new market for trading at 3:00 am this morning. The entire market covers an area of more than one mu and has a total of eight buildings, each with eight rooms. The roofs are covered with solid lead sheets, and the foundations are poured with steel-reinforced concrete. There are also skylights, iron railings, and drainage ditches. The sanitation and cleaning facilities are very thorough. In order to develop the trading of various fish products, the Fish Market is placing river fish, sea fish, and salted dried fish scales in the new auction market to prevent one side from being missed.</p>
<p>Original Market Repair</p>
<p>After the large auction market opens, the original auction market, which has been in use for a long time, needs to be repaired urgently. Therefore, transactions will be temporarily suspended and workers will be hired to repair it. Various projects will be reorganized. After completion, it will operate simultaneously with the new market.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Continues to Issue Two Types of Banknotes</h3>
<p>The Central Bank is issuing two types of banknotes, five yuan and ten yuan, to meet market needs. They will be circulated on the market from today. The bank issued a public announcement stating that the bank will issue five-yuan and ten-yuan notes printed by the British De La Rue Company from today. The front of the five-yuan note is green, and the front of the ten-yuan note is blue. The portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the left side of both notes, as well as the name of the bank and the amount, are black, and a four-color mixed pattern is printed in the middle. The watermark of Sun Yat-sen is on the right side. The back of the five-yuan note is grayish-green, and the back of the ten-yuan note is dark green. These five-yuan and ten-yuan notes will be used in the same way as the various five-yuan and ten-yuan notes previously issued by the bank. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Does Not Pocket Lost Property</h3>
<p>Zhu Houtang, a rickshaw puller from Zhabei, brought a package to the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau yesterday, saying, "I pulled a customer on Youmeiyuan Road today. The customer had many items. After getting off the rickshaw at Xinzha Bridge, I suddenly saw a package on the canvas. But the customer had disappeared. I waited for a long time, but he didn't come back. I opened the package and found 12 pieces of clothing. Because I couldn't return them, I brought them to your bureau and asked you to find the owner to claim them." The bureau said that although the rickshaw puller was a coolie, he was able to resist the temptation of unexpected wealth, which was commendable. In addition to verbally praising him in person, they specially issued a public notice for the owner to claim the items. If anyone has lost the above-mentioned clothing items, they can go to the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, to claim them.</p>
<h3>Shougu Bookstore's New Book Catalog</h3>

Collectors from all over the world and major libraries at home and abroad trust it deeply. They entrust it to find books at any cost. Recently, it has continuously collected a large number of ancient books from other cities, including many good editions.

<h3>Sha Wang's Wedding Today</h3>
