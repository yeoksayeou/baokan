<p>時評</p>
<h3>兩廣當局之回響如何</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>自蔣委員長發表關於處理兩廣方針之談話以來全國引領以待兩廣當局之迥響蓋自談話第三節中之「特以至誠坦白之心徵求兩廣當局赤誠忠信之饗應」一語以觀此項方針對時局所能發生之關係將視兩廣當局如何饗應以爲决定詞意頗爲明顯也</p>
<p>記者茲就談話原文提出三點以質兩廣當局一曰目前國家能「精誠團結一則治若「自相紛擾」則亂今中央表示力求貫澈和平統一政策矣兩廣欲循何途轍乎二日中央旣明言「在統一國家之中儘有尊重地方狀况之可能」則開誠洽商不難獲得至當之辦法兩廣能於正當軌道中擁護中央乎三日軍令之統一國策之服從紀律所在義無二致兩廣當局於「决不追求旣往亦决不令其他各省軍隊越入粵桂」之的言下準備如何行動乎凡此所問並無奧義兩廣如以整個國家之大局爲重則國內之團結地方環境問題之提出商討國紀之尊重皆可逕直致答吾則理之不正其詞必窮國家危亂之責有所歸矣</p>
<p>兩廣異動揭藥對外所以求國民之同情也惟事實所在殊難隱蔽昨報載六大學校長致陳李白電有云「避免國內戰爭保全國家元氣係今日全國人民共同心理」民心如此倘當事者不知改途易轍是何異與民心相爭鬥遠民心者必遭失敗吾人旣再三言之前途之光明與黑暗已燎若列炬人之聰明忌自閉塞一念之轉安危所繫今日國人尙引領以待兩廣當局對中央方針之迥響卽望其尙有懸崖勒馬之房也深冀弗再失機能有可滿人意之迥響解釋其改途易轍之行動</p>

<h3>藝術漫談　「禁止攀折」</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>現在正是所謂「綠陰時節」。遊山玩水，欣賞自然，沒有比現在更好的時節了。鄕村的田野中，好像打翻了綠染缸，處處是一堆一堆的綠。都市的公園中，綠色的布置更齊整：那樹木好像綠的寶塔，那冬靑好像綠的低垣，那草地好像綠的毯子。愛好天眞的人不歡喜這些人工的自然，嫌牠們撓揉造作；不歡喜這些規則的布置，嫌牠們呆板。牠們的確難能避免這種批評。這原是西洋風的庭園裝飾法。西洋入的生活，甚麼都科學化，連自然界的花木，也硬要牠們生作幾何形體。這點趣味，與一向愛好天眞自然的東洋人很不投合。我們偶然看見這種幾何形體的植物，一時也覺得新穎可喜。但是看慣之後，或者與野生植物比較起來，就覺得這些很不自然。若是詩人，畫家，帶了「有情化」的眼光而遊這種公園，其眼前所陳列的猶如一羣折了腰，斬了頭，截了肢體的人，其狀慘不忍覩。在他們，進公園不但不得娛樂，反而起了不快之感。</p>
<p>這種不快之戚，原是敏感的人所獨有的，普通人可以不必分担。但現今多數的公園中，另有一種更顯著的現象，常給遊客以不快的印象。這便是「禁止攀折」一類的標札。據有一位朋友說，他帶了十分愉快的心情而走進公園大門。每逢看見一個「禁止」的標札他的愉快可打一個九折。看見了兩打「禁止」的標札，他的愉快只剩一折八扣了。我很能了解他的心情。他看了這種「禁止」標札所以感覺不快者，並非為了他想攀花折柳，被禁止而不能如願之故。也不是為了他曾經攀花折柳吃過別人耳光的原故他所嫌惡的，是這種嚴厲的標札破壞了公園的美，傷害了人心的和平。</p>
<p>我對這意思完全同情。我們不吾定「禁止」兩字的存在，却嫌牠們不應該用在公園裏。譬如軍政重地，外面掛一張「禁止閒人入內」的火頭牌，我們並不討嫌牠。因為這些地方根本不可親愛，我們决不想在這些地方得個好感。就是放兩架機槍在門口，也由牠去，何况只標幾個文字呢？又如稅關，外面掛着一張「禁止繞越」的火頭牌，我們也不討嫌牠。因為稅關辦理非嚴密不可，我們决不希望其客客氣氣地坐視走私。卽使派兵警守護也不為過，何况貼一張字條兒呢，又如火車站的月台上，掛着「禁止越軌」的牌子；碘酒的瓶上，寫着「禁止內服」的紅字，我們非但不討嫌牠們，反而覺得感謝。因為牠們防人誤觸危險，有礙生命，某警吿是出於好意的。故「禁止」二字放在上述的地方，都很相當，我們都不覺得不快：但放在公園裏，就非常不調和，有時要刺痛遊人的眼睛。因為公園是供人遊樂的地方，使人得到慰安的地方。這裏面所有的全是美與和平。拿「禁止」這兩個嚴厲的字眼來放在美與和平的背景中，猶如萬綠叢中着了一點紅色，多少刺目；又好比許多親愛的嘉賓中混入了一個帶手槍的暴徒，多少不調和！</p>
<p>試想：休浴日之晨，或者放工後的傍晚，的了二三伴侶散步於公園中，在度着緊張的現代都會生活的人們，這原是好的恢復精神，鼓勵元氣，調節生活，享樂生趣的時機。但是一走進門，劈頭先給你吃一個警吿：「禁止攀折！」這遊客的心中，本無攀折之意。但吃了這警吿，心中不免一陣緊張，兩手似覺有些痙攣。自己誡吿自己，留心觸犯這規則。遇到可愛的木，甯可遠離一點，以避嫌疑。走了一會，看見一個池塘，內有遊魚往來。這裏沒有樹木，沒有花卉。遊客以為可在這裹放心地欣賞。遊魚之樂了。然而憑欄一望，當面又吃一個警吿：「禁止釣魚及拋擲……」遊客本來不要釣魚，也不願拿束西拋擲池中。但吃了這警吿，心中又是一陣緊張，兩手又覺一種痙　。再自己誡吿自己，留心觸犯規則。身子靠在欄杆上，兩手寧可反在背後，以避嫌疑。向池中望了一望，樂得早點走開，因為這樣地欣賞魚樂是很不安心的。再走了一會看見一塊草地，平廣而整齊，眞像一大片綠油漆的地板。中央一條小徑，迤邐曲折，好像橫臥在這地板上的一匹白練。這是多麼牽惹遊人的光景，誰都樂願到這小徑上去走一遭。但是一脚踏進，當眼又吃一個警吿：「禁止行走草地。」遊人本來不忍用脚去踐踏這些綠絨似的嫩草。但吃了這警吿，心中又是一陣緊張，兩脚也感到一種痙孿，再自己誡吿自己，留心觸犯規則。本想在小徑中央站立一會，望望四周的綠草，想像自己穿着神話裹的浮鞋，立在浮萍上面。但這有觸犯禁章的嫌疑。還不如快步穿過了這小徑，來得安心，再走一會，看見一個動物院：再走一會，看見一個秋千架；，再走一會，看見一溫室；但處處都有警吿給你吃。甚至閒坐在長椅子上，也要吃個「不准搬動椅子」的警吿。遊客原為找求安慰而來，但現在變成了為吃警吿而入公園了！供人遊樂的公園裏掛了許多「禁止」的標機，猶如貼肌的襯衣上着了許多蚤蝨，使人威覺怪難過的。美麗的花木，魚池，草地上掛了這些嚴厲的警吿，亦大為减色。這些眞是「殺風景」的東西。</p>

<h3>上海之榨油業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之二十九）</p>
<p>三、本埠榨油廠之現狀</p>
<p>各榨油廠雖有棉油，菜油，豆油，生油，椰子油之出產，但通常以棉油豆油為主，菜油生油等次之，往往於棉油，豆油營業清淡時製造，故僅為本埠榨油廠之副業。今將本埠現存之榨油廠，擇其規模較大者分述記於次。</p>
<p>一，長德榨油廠——該廠廠址在浦東張家濱，批發所設於豆市街長義米行內，於民國二十二年底創立，於二十三年六月間開車榨油。資本原為三十萬元，現增至四十萬元，過去每股百元，現減為二十元。該廠以產豆油為主，聞不久亦將榨取棉子油。歷年營業頗佳，現任董事為顧馨一，陳子彝，齊致，瞿頌嘉，徐冠南，黃頌孚，嚴筱家，陳煜明，徐申如。</p>
<p>二，大德新榨油廠——該廠係以前大德晉油廠蛻化而成，於民國十九年設立，資本原為十五萬兩，今已增為三十萬元，專務所設於江西路一零五號二樓，廠址有二，第一廠在麥根路一七二號，第二廠在浦東楊家渡，董事兼經理為朱祖葉君，董事兼協理為曹莘耕君。該廠出品有棉子油，豆油，椰子油，桐油四種。</p>
<p>三，立德油廠——該廠成立迄今已有四十餘年之歷史，事務所設於法租界外灘七號，廠屋設於蘇州河北戈登路底七十八號，廠主兼經理為劉長蔭君，副經理為劉志鄉君，廠長為劉長蔭長子劉順德君。廠基面積達四十餘畝，連機器在內，約值一百萬元左右。該廠目前年八月至去年七月一年間，約用去原料棉子三十五萬擔，得棉子油三萬四五千擔。</p>
<p>四，順餘機器榨油廠——該廠於民國八年設立，二十一年八月曾一度改組，發行所設於愛文義路一一二號，廠址在曹家浜北光復路八號，資本國幣二十五萬元，董事長為張趾卿君，朱靜安，蔡岐卿，何叔明諸君，皆為該廠董事，廠址面積佔地十八畝，出產以棉子油豆油為主。</p>
<p>五，大有餘榨油廠——該廠於民國十年成立，初規模狹小，至民國十七年間合併大盛，新昌兩廠後，規模逐形擴大，資本增至三十萬元。該廠工場在西蘇州中三十六號（戈登路底），事務所在北京路慶順裡，董事長為秦潤柳氏，董事兼經理為張錫卿氏。出品有豆油棉子油，生油，椰子油四種。</p>
<p>六，大昌新榨油廠——該廠係大昌榨油公司蛻化而成，於民國二十二年創立，資本十萬元，發行所設於法租界朱葆三路，廠址在譚家渡光復路浜北，占地約十二為，張彩生，陸成林，張梅城曹可山，錢中卿，皆為該廠董事。營業蠻稱發達，不幸於去年一月聞該廠廠屋竟遭回祿，惟目下仍照常開車榨油。今年曾一度改組，加稱潤記，資本增為二十五萬元。</p>
<p>此外尚有穗彎榨油廠及昌記榨油廠，亦為本埠該業之佼佼者，廠址在曹家渡，資本四萬元，十餘年前創設，歷史頗悠久云。</p>
<p>此外各榨油廠所用之機器亦頗不一述。按榨油機種類不同，凡榨豆油不能榨其他油類；至棉子油，菜油，椰子油及生油之榨製，則可用同一機器。同時榨製豆油之機器又有新式老式之分，老式榨油機俗稱螺絲車，用人力絞製，每車約須工人八名，且產量不多。新式榨油機則頗進步，每日夜可榨六次，每次可榨豆餅十四斤。</p>
<p>四·銷路及市況</p>
<p>本埠各榨油廠出品之銷路，以豆油與豆餅為最大，豆油大多供給本埠居民食用。豆餅分正牌，副牌，三牌，四牌，五牌，等數種，正牌每片重六十二磅，三牌五十八磅，四牌五十四磅，五牌五十磅，至其實質則無一致。豆餅主要銷路為汕頭，以每年之十一月起至來年三四月止為旺期，蓋當時適為培植果樹之際。其次如溫州、台州、及本埠附近，均有銷售。棉子油以銷往國外居多，本埠亦有購用作為食料者，但為數有限。至於棉籽餅則完全銷往日本，作為肥田之用，上海三井三菱吉田等洋行均有大宗購買云。椰子油為製造肥皂原料多數銷與本埠各肥皂廠，其油餅則僅作牛畜等飼料而已。生油粵人嗜之較多，大概以銷往華南為主。至於豆油售價，去年上春每擔僅十一元左右，秋後因隴海津浦兩路豆收欠佳，豆價步漲，油價遂即高漲至十四五元，目下竟漲至二十二元四角，大連方面亦相彷彿。豆餅去年上春正牌每片僅一元六角左右，後又步漲，今已漲至二元二角半，至於三牌四牌五牌之市價，當亦隨之增漲，三牌較</p>

<p>昨日粉巿、上午開般後、各月份呈初平繼俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、一致回跌六七角左右、故近期開價時、曾回小一分零、拍至十月份、則人心堅勁、未見小面、故二盤開始、各月份開價、又步步良好、以目下雖値新麥時期、惟本外埠各廠、終以時事多故、從事穩健、故拋貨均隨小麥之進吾為轉移、市氣暫難過落、當為此故、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、大致停頓、出入亦未暢旺、市面亦趨盤旋、照業中人之推測、此後升沉、將　實銷之消長、方有上落、惟社會環境不良、投機興奮、故時與實際情形、不能符合云、</p>
<h3>交易不旺　期麥大勢平穩　現麥决貨續漲二分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平穩以洋麥報價、回跌甚猛、惟以國內情形、未能安定、且東商在蕪湖收買小麥、數雖有限、人心不免注意、故在消息殊異之下、交易旣少、上落亦極細微、迨至下午開盤、交易較暢、價亦盤旋、較之前日收價、計好二三四分不等、至現麥巿况、高貨互擯、仍在四元二角之間、中關貨則續提、分、統市計開一萬餘包、至內地各路報價、因到貨甚湧、且以天時之乾晴、喊價已較鬆動、此後或者因供求之互異、市價有略挫之勢云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、聞有零星陣雨、天氣稍凉、加麥情形未有變化、但開始需雨、套賣漸多、預漸有陣雨、</p>
<h3>客祗有應酬交易</h3>
<p>昨客釉到頭不絕、而去化大减、客帮雖有北洋問津江西機晚、內地帮亦有中關贛晚辦裝、但去數不多、內地與北帮成交均不滿千包、本街銷路亦不及日前之活、隨巿應酬贛米一千餘包、甬柳江北機米各一百包、小絞二百五十包、全日統計成交只有三千之譜、且多應酬性質、小紋米立小角外、客秈亦被小數分及一角不等、惟昨日北帮應酬後、二部份人心巳在活動、如今明北銷暢旺、則市價立可轉好也、</p>
<h3>河米去路仍屬零星</h3>
<p>（滬南）　昨日各帮來源十七八號、貨共三千餘石、奈因本街銷塲旣淡、包胃亦僅大連帮辦七百餘包、故市况猶帶軟象、厚早粳及薄稻行情悉無甚榮辱、杜洋尖亦定、獨變元貨稀胃香、挺起角許、陰元仍無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十五六號、巿上各貨去胃依然平淡、市價白粳又小角外、薄稻價小近角、羊杜尖貨稀價尙平定、客尖零銷亦呆、市形平平、陰變元價小七八分、其餘各貨、價又見軟勢、</p>
<h3>絲茶　橫濱絲較前漲十二元</h3>
<p>邇來本埠絲市、因國外絲訊漲跌互岐、上落甚微、故尙稱呆穩、洋莊絲交、日有售開、惟不能十分暢利耳、昨紐約絲價又吿回跌、計日絲（七五及八三均度）華絲（上海絲七八勻度及廣東絲）、每磅持價均下跌二分、里昂絲市、除日絲較漲一法郞外、其餘絲品悉持原價、倫敦絲價、久無變動、現上海絲A字一三·二二仍售六先令十便士半、B字為六先令四便士半、昨橫濱絲價較穩、現期售開均較前漲十二元</p>
<h3>人造絲浙帮走銷較暢</h3>
<p>人造絲交易、更見淸淡、惟巿價無榮辱、海關標出之一百二十號天橋牌、成交二十餘箱、價仍四百十餘元、購者本埠綢廠、至歐貨交易缺乏、且甚零星、現紹興及杭州一百二十號天橋牌、價的四百三十餘元、為走銷最　者、其他牌子、及毆貨均少動</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉跌價引銷　紅茶以花香最俏</h3>
<p>昨日茶巿、交易續旺、全市成交祁寗紅茶及屯溪婺源遂安等路綠茶、共計五千六百餘箱、紅茶市面、仍以花香一項最俏、但到貨不多、供不應、祈浮紅茶、天裕洋行又復開辦、形勢頗為堅穩、至屯溪珍眉、交易依然冷淡、徽州珍眉及中低莊抽芯、錦隆同孚永興均略有進胃、全市成交近三百餘箱、低莊秀眉銷翠玻璃者（Tripoli）協和錦降均先後進數百箱、價自十八元至二十三四元不等、遂珍怡和曾發出電報、惟存貨不多、銷路尙可、市面頗能立定、婺北抽珍開出百十九元、總觀本週各路珍眉、均頗活動、尤以屯珍為更俏利、價亦見挺、至平水茶、昨日怡和辦珠茶一百餘件、價五十四元、本週平水各茶、價雖立住、但交易較上週大形淸淡云、</p>
<h3>五金　薄鐵缺貨市盤堅挺</h3>
<p>薄鐵客帮生意雖屬不多、然廠家交易、則頗旺盛惟同業因此項貨品、利益甚薄、購定極鮮、故存貨淺涸、行情乃大形堅俏、如二十二十八寸正號貨、每箱開六十五元至七十元（因放賬及現欵關係、故有五元上落、）而俗稱野鷄薄鐵之副號貨、每箱則售五十一二元、查昨市開出為數有三十餘箱之譜、故　存更弱云、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布已乏大量去路</h3>
<p>棉布市況、近受時局影響、心思不能一致、兼因實銷限於一隅、又乏大量赤化、故人心仍見　懈、昨湘省進各種本廠貨、　業府綢、下檔細斜綢布二百餘件、用幫積辦本廠　嘰值買　紋呢花布色丁花絨，漢口幫進本廠細斜、漂布、條素府綢等貨一百餘件、本街批發莊辦進本廠條素府綢、棉布、麻紗、清水漂布、洋紗等貨二百餘件、白貨粗布、頗多存積、進胃較呆、市上元洋需要仍殷、廠家坯布每疋二角以上、下檔條素府、因東貨坯布售盤大增、各廠出品漸見匱乏、每疋漲起二三角不等、各廠深色克　綢、亦因坯布價漲、加價一二角、其餘各貨均屬平疲、東貨細布再跌每疋二分半之　云、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦子堅俏蟹子步跌</h3>
<p>蝦尾到銷兩淡市況平定</p>
<p>（蝦尾）邇日各地來貨、均不踴躍、因時值籌汛、極易　壞、故各客幫去化、亦甚零落、本埠存貨較多之行號家、大概移　冷汽庫栈、預備秋季再　、所以現市、跌既不能、漲亦非易、行家售盤、元東尾高貨一百十二元、統貨一百零七八元、朝　尾九十八元至九十三元、金鉤尾冷汽貨一百十二元、熱水新貨一百元、小隻九十六元、金山尾大隻斷貨、中隻一百三十、至一百二十八元、小隻一百二十二元、色光萎次者一百十六元、田扁尾一百元、本港尾七十五六元、國產烟台尾五十五元、潮身貨四十二元、小隻三十四元至二十八元、泗尾二十二元、</p>
<p>（蝦子）今庚頭二汛、新貨出水之際、適逢天陰多雨、致貨難　出、糟蹋極巨、來源既稀、價故高昂、惟二汛收穫、刻亦未見豐盈、市售乾身好貨一百三十元、本色原貨一百二十元、做潮一百元、如今後三汛收成不旺、市盤雖望鬆下、</p>
<p>（蟹子）　波外出山貨、　有到來、客銷尚未發展、市已步跌、昨日行盤售過、做色乾燥貨三十元、原貨二十四元至二十二元、市勢平庸、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海口枝開價跌三四元</h3>
<p>前日琐州輸運到之二批海口枝水庚枝共五百六十五箱、昨已全數見樣、市勢本望小定、未因首批普通莊貨品不甚合銷、裝出後復有退還者、故人心下游、轉跌三四元不一、當開出水　枝二十三元、次至十八九元、再次十四五元至十二元、由各行派通、後市多到或須再鬆、</p>
<h3>新瓜子價難鬆落</h3>
<p>天氣過旱產量減少</p>
<p>據徐州函訊、新瓜子因天氣過旱、兼之產區有改植棉花者、近雖見雨、產量終必減少、大約一個月內、方可見新、屆時以　述　係、價格恐未能過小、此間陳貨行方大都隨市卸兌、且係普通貨較多、故售價步軟、惟高貨較稀、印象略定、日內有提莊子一批、將　徐州　到、　價貨可銷　轉機、</p>

<h3>非常時期的兒童生活</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「非常時期的兒童生活，」這個題目，是根據非常時期的政治，經濟，敎育……等等而來的。國家的一切大計，都由平凡的時期而轉入了非常的時期，兒童是國家的根苗，社會的新生樓，又怎樣能例外呢？</p>
<p>什麽是非常時期的兒童生活？就我看來，應該從下面數項入手：</p>
<p>厲行新生活　新生活運動，是提高民族道德，挽回社會頹風的唯一的運動。自從蔣委員長提倡以來，巳收到相當的效果。成人們對於新生活的力行，固然是不消說得；就是兒童們對於新生活的奉行，也是應該努力的。允其在這非常時期的兒童生活中，無論衣。食。住。行。動作。言語，處處應該合乎新生活的標準。能够持之以恒，養成習慣，不但對於自己，有很好的益處，就是對於社會國家，也有很好的效果呢。</p>
<p>努力鍜鍊體格　外國人時常譏笑我們，是東亞病夫，這是我們很覺慚愧的。在此非常時期中，我們為剷除這個「東亞病夫」的侮辱的名號起見，對於體格的鍛鍊，眞是急不容緩。兒童旣是國家的棟樑，所以兒童體格的鍜鍊，也是一件重要的事。很希望在此非常時期中，兒童們大家一致起來，每天抽出二三小時，專門注重在體格方面的訓練。現在的兒童，有了健全的體格，决一代的國民，自然也有健康的身體了！到了那個時候，東亞病夫的侮辱，自然會根本消滅。</p>
<p>完成兒童號飛機　飛機是現代戰爭的利器，不久以前，兒童們曾發起籌購兒童號飛機一架，獻給政府，以備抗敵之用。可是直到現在，兒童號飛機，還沒有達到完成的地步。在此非常時期中，應該努力繼起，集全國兒童的糖果之費，來完成兒童號飛機，也許是可能的。</p>
<p>總之，非常時期的兒童生活，是應該努力的，刻苦的。希望親愛的兒童們，大家起來，——一致的起來，實行非常時期中的生活。</p>
<h3>國際兒童消息</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>暑期旅行</p>
<p>英國有若干兒童，現正在向各船公司接洽，擬乘今年暑假之暇，免費的搭乘，而往英屬各地旅行，一以增加帝國的地理與原料生產的智識，一以藉此機會，而與各屬地小朋友們，互相切磋學業，交換智識，聯絡感情。道個計劃，是由倫敦某小學的小學生發起的，在某報上發表之後，全國各地及愛爾蘭的小朋友們，紛紛加以贊助。現巳有同志四十餘人，年齡均在十一歲至十七歲之間，預計至本年暑假前，或可達七十人之數。每人所需旅費，以四十鎊為度。現正由若干敎育家，在擬議一切計劃中，大致頗有成為事實之希望。威爾斯的某兒童，更創議往北極旅行，但未能得敎育家們的通過，所以該議現巳被打消。</p>
<p>工作實習</p>
<p>蘇聯莫斯科，從去年十月間起，由兒童們向動的組織了一個兒童工作團，凡是自八歲至十五歲，而在校肄業的兒童，均可加入。加入之後，每天在上課時間之外，均須往各工廠中，作工二小時，不支報酬。至十二月，得到當局的允許，於是立即有叫萬餘兒童，被支配到全市的各種工廠中去。幷定着工作成績最佳的若干兒童，過了若干時，有頒給獎章的權利，以資鼓勵。所以現在已有近十萬兒童，加入了這個集團去。因着人數的激增，各工廠中，無法全部的安挿，於是把每人每汨的工作時間，减至一時一刻，若是將來加入的兒童數續有增加，工作時間，或許更將减縮。這種運動，現已很敏捷地普及全國，有若干集體農塲中，現亦已有不少兒童，每天輪流着在內義務工作。依估計，全國當已有四十餘萬兒童，在工作着。所以再過十年，待到這些兒童，長大成人時，生產事業的成續，更不知將如何發達。</p>
<p>兒童日報</p>
<p>比利時國的兒童們，在去年七月間，創設了一個兒童日報，叫做「比利時兒童」。全部的撰稿者，與編輯者，都是十六歲以下的兒童。該報日出一張半，共計六頁，廣吿的估二頁半，國內外消息，計佔一張半，其餘，完全刊登論文，及兒童科學，與文藝等，銷數的一萬份稍强。這個日報，雖然是附設在一家周刋社裏的，但是除了在印刷上面，合作着，關於編輯發行等各方面，是完全獨立的。這個日報，不只在歐洲，首屈一指，即以全世界而論，完全由兒童辦理者，怕也只此一家吧。</p>
<h3>奇怪的人頭</h3>
<p>— 子良</p>
<p>用白色的厚紙兩張，剪成同樣的圓形，照甲圖乙圖，依照樣畫好了，再拿乙圖一二三白的地方挖去，然後把乙圖疊在甲圖上，中央用釘定住，隨意轉動，就變成種種面目了。</p>
<h3>圖甲</h3>

<h3>電話</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>一天下午，敏兒放學回家，而他的爸爸還沒有回家哩。他便知道他爸爸今天一定是有要事，因為當他放學回來時，他爸爸總已辦公完畢回家了。忽然鄰家的人來說：你爸爸今天有要事，恐怕來不及回來了。他聽得了很奇怪，我爸爸能講電話嗎？其實他是不知道甚麽呌電話？</p>
<p>『今天又出了一件奇怪的事，哥哥爸爸怎麽能講電話？你可知道什麽呌電話』嗎？</p>
<p>『你不聽聽淸楚，又來胡擾了。你知道電話是什麽東西？它是很奇妙的，能把在很遠地方人所說的話　很淸淸楚楚的一句一句傳到你耳朶裏，你想奇怪不奇怪』？</p>
<p>『是奇怪的，那麽這電話倒底是甚麽東西？我至今還是莫明其妙』。</p>
<p>『電話是一種傳達聲音的東西，它外面的形狀像一隻長方形鐵做的匣子。在鐵匣的一面，便是掛了一根東西，它的兩端有兩隻喇叭。在上面的一隻，可放在耳朶上聽，所以呌它是受話機。下面的一隻是講話的，所以呌傳話機。更有一根電錢從這電話機裏通到兩隻喇叭裏，那電綫是接到專管電話的電話局裏。如果雙方要通話，祗要把對方的電話號碼吿訴給電話局裏的接錢員，於是他們便把你所要通話的綫接起來，雙方就能像對面一般的講話了。至於它怎能通話？都是靠這兩隻喇叭。如果一個人向傳話機說話的時候，就振動了附近的空氣，而空氣更振動了機中的薄膜，薄膜隨聲音而振動，使機內的炭粉一會鬆弛，一會緊張，就從電綫中傳到對方的受話機裏。受話機裏的磁石也起作用，使磁石裏面鐵質薄膜振動，和傳話機中的薄膜振動完全相同。對方便能聽得你所說的話了。不過雙方在通話時，最不可缺少的就是電流，如果沒有電流，便失去它的效用了』。聰兒說完了這許多話，恐怕敏兒還不完全了解，所以同他到鄰家　的電話機旁去試騐給他看，使他一一明瞭其中的道理</p>
<h3>粉筆</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友！當你們上課的時候，不是時常看見老師，手裏拿着一枝小小的粉筆，在烏黑黑的，黑板上，寫着幾個書本上的生字，呌你們一個一個去認識它。哼！你不耍看輕這小小的一枝粉筆，是値得什麽去研究它？但要知道你們識的字，所學的算術……那一種不是敎師用着粉筆，在黑板上寫出來，敎你們這個字應該怎樣寫的，那樣寫是錯的。這份算術式子，應該這樣一步一步演出來，你想：你們求得的智識，不是都完全靠它嗎？那末，這小小的一枝粉筆，當然値得我們去討論，値得我們去硏究的。小弟弟！小妹妹！今日我就來談談粉筆是怎樣做成的？你們可知道嗎？</p>
<p>製造的方面是用沈澱的炭酸石灰一百磅，加以多量的淸水，使它成為稀石灰乳，再用布袋濾去粗渣，靜置澄淸後，只留適宜的水，就成濃厚的石灰乳。再把小麥澱粉加水煮成十磅稠糊加於石灰乳中，用棒攪之，使稠糊和石灰混合均勻，就將它注入銅質的模型中，十餘分鐘後傾出，曬四五天就成一枝乾粉筆。又有製法更易，只用石膏加熱煆成熟石膏，研細用水漂去粗渣，取細膩者和以水與泥，注入模型中，數分鐘後取出曬乾，就成粉筆。</p>
<h3>農人苦</h3>
<p>— 方文學</p>
<p>老農夫何其苦！一年四季鋤黃士，收不着三擔稻，田主納租兩担五。子號寒！妻啼苦！。菜根粗飯充飢肚。老農夫，不辭苦！農人婦，何其苦！春夏秋冬織土布，織不着三疋布，債主要去兩疋五。兒子哭！女嘴鼓！一條褲子補又補，農人婦，莫辭苦！</p>
<p>科學小問題</p>
<h3>太陽出落時怎覺特別大</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>小朋友！只耍你們稍留心一點的話，在淸晨或傍晚，在東方或西方太陽剛剛在水平綫上的時候。這時所看到的太陽，確是好像比日中時的太陽，有大出二倍多的光景，這究竟是什麼原故啊？有好多人說：因為那時的太陽離地球較近，所以看起來大，其實剛剛相反，那時的距離要比日中時來得遠。由此說來，豈不更見神奇了嗎？</p>
<p>在沒有說出這個道理之前，首先我來舉一個比喻，就比較容易明白得多了。隨便取一根筷子，斜着放半根筷子在水裏的時候，其餘的一半在水外，那便可見到水裏的半根，好像不是同水外的半根是一根筷子似的。這是因為眼睛同筷子中間隔着兩種不同的媒介——折光的關係。（所謂兩種不同的媒介，便是水和空氣。）所以，當我們看太陽的時候，也是經過兩種不同的媒介——空氣及眞空。（地球外面沒有空氣的地方，呌眞空。）當日中的時候，視綫所經過的空氣層，假定說是二十哩，但當太陽在水平錢的時候，視錢所經過空氣層就不止二十哩。因為兩種惰形都有折光，並且空氣層有厚薄，所以折光的程度也有不同，而人眼裏的太陽也就有大小之別了。</p>

<h3>我與申報兒童專刊</h3>
<p>— 鄞縣縣立鄪山小學五年級生林在政</p>
<p>我是本刋一個忠實的讀者，我與本刋之相識，巳有一年多的時間了，在這一年間，我沒有與本刋片刻離開過。啊！「申報兒童專刋」眞是我的一個最最要好的『朋友』呀！</p>
<p>每次從綠衣郵差送進我這個「朋友」來的時候，我總是手舞足蹈，有說不出的快樂，急忙的將他拆開來，然後就專心致志一篇一篇的讀下去。假使遇有疑問處，就用鉛筆劃出，到第二天上學時去請敎我的級任敎師。旣巳明白了每篇的大意後，我還要每篇去讀熟，因為他的內容比較在上課時書本上的功課還要豐富，所以它使我增進了的「學問」不少。</p>
<p>在本刋中並月還有很有意義的故事，很有趣味的漫畫，又有短小的詩歌，長篇的義狗傳，更有文章很好的兒童園地，以及種種的常識……眞是「包羅萬象」，「應有盡有」，的確是我們小學生的恩物。</p>
<p>「申報兒童專刋」它能增進我的「學問」，它能豐富我的「常識」，它能督促我的「上進」，它能糾正我的「錯處」。有這四個好處，所以我與它是一個最最要好的「朋友」</p>
<h3>小傀儡翻槓</h3>
<p>— 徐蝶仙</p>
<p>利用鉛筆頭做成的小玩意</p>
<p>小朋友！你們平常所用的鉛筆，在將用完而祇剩寸多長短的時候，不是因它不利書寫，都丟棄了嗎？現在，請你們把這短短的一段鉛筆頭，保存好了，我來敎你們製造樣有趣味的玩意兒——小傀儡翻槓——材料…鉛筆頭一段（約一寸半左右），別針四只，鉛絲一根，舊毛筆一校（把筆頭拔去），綫一根。</p>
<p>做法…先將鉛筆頭截斷為二，其一略長，如「一圖」。　將長的一段，用小刀在一端的四分之一的地位，刻成圖形頭顱，以墨筆繪成面目，如「二圖」。　再將短的一段，用刀對劈成四，每塊再利薄之（不必太薄）如「二圖」。將刮薄之木片，以兩片作手，一端切去二角，研一圓孔，（注意硏孔時，手須輕而緩，重則木裂），一端刻成拳形，亦硏一孔（略小），如「四圖」，其餘二片亦照樣刻之為足，如「五圖」。</p>
<p>然後將別針剪斷，照「六圖」釘入上下四部份，即成一手足活動的小傀儡了。　把鉛絲穿入小傀儡的兩手小孔中，彎曲，再穿入筆孔中（筆者預先對穿兩孔），再照圓彎成曲形，一端套繋一綫，全部工作亦完畢。玩時，一手握筆管，一手持綫緩緩引之，則小傀儡自能上下活動，姿勢如在翻盤鐵槓一般，趣味無窮。</p>

<h3>小隊標記與其他</h3>
<p>—答靑島，市立中學，馬隊張鼎助</p>
<p>鼎勛弟：</p>
<p>你提出來的問題的確很有趣。我們從前當小隊員的時候，對這也和你一樣地注意過的。因為我們能適宜地利用我們的標記，我們隊裏的每個人對自己的小隊簡直和對自己的家庭一樣地親切呢：</p>
<p>你說：一小隊標記的應用和小隊精神的發揚是有很大關係的」，這句話是絲毫不錯的。至於小隊標記的應用，最好由你們全體隊員來設計，這樣比較有意義得多；這裏我們來提供你些意見，祇是給你作參考吧了。</p>
<p>就以你自己小隊來說，你旣是馬隊的隊員，那麽你應在你的生活中，隨時表示出你是馬隊的一員。所以我們以為在法定的馬帶肩帶和馬隊旗以外，應該多收集些其他的材料：</p>
<p>「　　　　　　」這是馬嘯的聲音，當然你們每個隊員都巳把它學會了的。但你不利了它也是徒然，所以我們希望你們所常常利用這隊聲。比如在集合的時候，隊長不妨用馬聲來召集，各隊員也可以用馬聲來回應，立刻集合起來，這是很有意義的。</p>
<p>我們用隊色來表示我們隊別，人家是不會十分明白的。如果你們大家用牛骨彫成一個馬頭套在領巾上，豈不是美觀而且便於辯別嗎？國外童子軍還有用絨布漆上隊形佩在右臂上的呢！</p>
<p>我們想你不妨學圓騰民族一樣設計彫刻一根圖騰柱，竪立在團部的營地上或操場上，以後你們隊裏有什麽大事，也可以隨時大要地記上去。喜歡的時候，你們還可以繞着圖騰柱歌唱呢。</p>
<p>倘然你以為圓騰柱太重笨，不妨來一根紀念杖。在杖上你也可以問樣地繪上許多馬形，同時還可以把許多値得紀念的事物記上去或請和你們有關係的長者簽名在杖上。此外在你們的營帳，營桂，軍棍，儲物箱和種種用具上却可以刻上或繪上馬的圖形的。</p>
<p>在你們的歌唱歡呼與遊戲上也不妨注入些「馬」的意　。倘然有一首馬隊歌，有兩三支馬隊歡呼和一兩種特製的「馬」的遊戲！這一定為你們的馬隊生色不少的。</p>
<p>除了上述種種以外，還有一點你要特別留意的，就是要從精神上表示你是馬隊的隊員。就是說你要充分表現「馬」的精神：「忠厚勤謹」，「刻苦耐勞」，「任重致運」，都是馬的優點呢！馬廐裏的童子軍不是具有馬的精神了嗎？</p>
<p>兄弟，請你努力吧！你們的友隊一定會眞的唯你們的「馬」首是瞻的。我們盼望最近的將來能得到你的報吿。請了，祝你像龍馬般精神！</p>

<h3>義狗傳（二十四）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>柯甘士夫人和小愛洛又驚又喜，一時說不出什麼話米，柏德希又怒又急，在那包着鐵皮的橡木大門上沒命的撞着，伊們不敢開門放它出去，用了種種的方法安慰它。伊們去取了甜糕和汁肉來喂給它吃，又牽他到壁爐跟前烘火取暖，但是什麽都沒有用。柏德希拒絕一切的慰安和優待，不肯離開那緊閉着得大門一步。</p>
<p>這時是在六點鐘光景，那磨坊主人柯甘士從對面一扇小門中垂頭喪氣的走了進來，慘曰了臉，抖顫着聲音，向他的妻子說道：「這筆錢是永遠失掉了。我們打了燈到處找尋，什麽都沒有。我們所有的現鈔和女兒的將來的　資一切都完了！夫人忙把那錢放在他的手中，並且吿訴他，這銀是怎樣送回來的。柯甘士顫顫地坐倒在一張椅中，雙手掩住了他的臉，又含羞，又悔恨，末後他才喃喃地說道：「我待那孩子實在太壞了。不應當受他的恩惠」</p>
<p>小愛洛鼓起了勇氣，走近伊的父親，把那鬆髮的頭貼在父親的臉上，低聲說道：「父親，南洛也許會得來的。明天早上他也許來吧。」柯甘士摟住了伊在懷中，臉色白得可怕，嘴角不住的顫動着，一面答道：「當然，當然，他會得來的，聖誕日那天，他可以住在這裏，便是永久的住下去也得。我一時糊塗，犯下了罪惡，上帝便來懲罰我了，求上帝助我，我對於那孩子定要補報一切——我一定要補報一切。</p>
<p>小愛洛又感激又快樂的和伊父親接了一吻，於是從他的膝蓋上跳了下來，到那柏德希蹬着的所在，手舞足蹈的說道：『今夜我要請柏德希好好的吃一頓了。』</p>
<p>伊的父親點着頭，壯嚴地說道：『好好，給這狗吃些最好的東西。』原來他老人家自從收回了那等失去的錢鈔之後，直感動到心坎深處了。</p>
<p>這一夜是聖誕的前夜，磨坊中裝飾得花團錦簇的十分富麗，橡矛上掛着許多冬靑的圈兒。在那一大堆緋紅的天竹干裏，供着一個釘在十字架上的耶穌聖像和座杜鵑緣時的大鐘，四周史滿掛着五色繽紛的紙燈和專給小愛洛玩弄的各種玩具。至於吃的東西，那麽乳酪和蜂蜜，魚肉和麵包以及彩紙包裏的糖果，什麽都有。屋中的每　處都充滿着燈光和暖氣。小愛洛就預備請柏德希坐在這裏做上客，參與道盛大的宴會。</p>

<p>患淋病者。卽俗謂之白濁也。論其性毒。允如洪水猛獸。倘不及時治愈。其變化力非常迅速例如急性變為慢性。前尿道變為後尿道。繼則侵入直腸。為直腸淋。又可併發副睪丸　。尿道狹窄。攝護腺炎。關節炎。精囊炎。精系炎等等。攷本症之發生。乃為淋疾雙球菌之侵襲。其症狀初起時尿道口灼熱。或放尿困難。病勢再進。則尿道化膿。小便時異常疼痛。此乃初起急性淋之病象也。倘遷延不治。則變為慢性。故慢性淋。皆為急性淋遷延轉變而來。撤尿時有黃色之粘液物發生。混於尿道中。早起時被膿汁粘著尿道口。以致小便困難而疼痛。如淋毒僅限於尿道之前部者。為前尿道淋。兼侵及尿道之後部者。卽併發後尿道淋矣。副睪丸炎。係睪丸一側腫大。急性者。甚至惡寒發熱。從此竟不能生育。又尿道狹窄者。係尿道腫脹。故放尿時。往往於陰莖外面或肛門周圍穿孔而出。攝護腺炎者。卽會陰部腫脹。生如栗子大之硬結。或大如鷄卵。大便疼痛。甚至化膿。非常危險。關節炎者。係淋毒侵入全身關節。手足疼痛不能伸屆。竟或成為殘廢。精囊炎及精系炎者。係淋毒由輸精管而入精囊。其症狀係腰部疼痛。往往夢遺。或精中混有血液。再進則變為精系炎。於是股部亦牽扯疼痛矣。總觀淋病之變化殊多。凡患之者。應在初發時。卽須切實求治。毌稍遲疑。本埠法租界寗波路。父子醫院。專治此症。能有速效。然患者有因經濟上關係。或以時間上及作業上之關係。或因路途遙遠。就醫不便者。則自療之法尙矣。如『哥那多登』者。乃治淋之良藥。醫家臨床經騐。屢試屢效。故敢為病家作忠實之介紹。該藥係丸劑。每盒售洋二元。本埠法大馬路。西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售。</p>
<h3>甘露治癬之奇效</h3>
<p>— （允中）</p>
<p>方今市上出售之皮膚病藥。名目繁多。不遑枚舉。特考其成分。或含有克利蔭羅賓之毒質。用之不愼。經皮膚吸收而入體內。通過腎臟。而由尿中排出於體外。故每有引起腎臟炎。蛋白尿之虞。與病家所希望之目的。適得其反。予為人治皮膚病。嘗用『甘露』。輕症一塗卽愈。最重者不過三四瓶。從未有何等副作用發生。蓋『甘露』一藥。係上海法大馬路。西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社。經售已久之唯一皮膚病特效藥。以特別的化學方法製成。為專治頑癬，乾癬，鬎鬁頭，疥瘡，狼瘡，癢疹，黃水瘡，坐板瘡，汗斑，瘢風，狐臭，濕疹等一切皮膚病之聖劑。完全不含毒質。味極芬芳。不染衣服。塗布數分鐘後。卽可殺蟲止癢。同時滲入組織。刺戟白血球。融和息部血液。除去破壞組織。促進新生細胞。且不論患部如何廣大。僅作用於患部皮膚。對於健康之皮膚。無所作用。卽持續塗治。亦不引起皮膚炎。腎臟炎。蛋白尿等。性質和平。功效極顯。故敢樂為介紹。聞『甘露』售價每瓶祇一元</p>
<h3>胃病宜注意</h3>
<p>— 仙霞</p>
<p>醫病不如防病。防病之道。端在節飲節食。虛弱或年老之人。更宜注意。然嘗見社會一般人士。往往飲食過量。喜嗜濃茶烟酒。致胃液被其冲淡。胃壁受其刺戟。食物不化。停滯胃腸。因而成為消化不良。胃痛。腹痛嘔吐。下痢。脹悶噯氣等症。致害匪淺。痛苦允甚。至若事前失之防範。旣罹諸般胃病。則唯有積極療治。投以確切可靠之藥劑。尙可不致危害身體。而引起其他疾病也。</p>
<h3>胃必靈　治胃病最有把握</h3>
<p>胃必靈一藥。當今治胃病藥中之最有把握者也。治上述各症。無不功效神速。洵屬良藥。價每盒實售一元。上海法大馬路西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售。</p>
<h3>遺精與神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— （伯銘）</p>
<p>精液之於人身。其關係甚大。精液竭。則百病生。理所然也。然觀夫世間靑年。往往於春機發動時。獨居無偶。寂然寡歡。每藉手淫以暢其偷快。一而再。再而三。為日旣久。乃成習慣。卒至精液枯竭。形銷骨立。百病叢生。神經衰弱。眼花耳鳴。頭重頭暈。不眠健忘。感情易變。多逢憂怒。厭惡職業。不能作事。而生殖器允蒙其害。精門不固。遺精。陰萎。早洩。隨與俱來。屢於夢寐之際。精液洩漏。總之。神經衰弱之原。由於遺精。而遺精之原因。則繫乎手淫。是二者。互為因果。關係密切。患此者。亟須就醫療治而圖根本之解决。最簡易確切之自療法。可服『喜汝康』藥片。此藥為上海法租界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社發行。價每瓶二元。治神經衰弱及遺精有特效。患者同時並應束身自好。修養身心。則不旋踵而還我健康矣。</p>
<h3>雀斑實騐治法</h3>
<p>（河北寗晉沙美茵女士來函）</p>
<p>我少時就患着雀斑。成了終身美容之累。不免常要引此為可憾的事。前年。外子任事津沽的時候。曾求治於某外藉醫師。但是他說是不能治愈的。就也使我絕望了。不過我求治的心。却並不完全絕念。今年歲首。外子又於役滬上。回來的時候。在行篋裏。拿出兩瓶『　麗』香膏給我。他說。「這是」種治斑愈皰的美容劑。不但風行於上海。在國內幾乎是到處風行。好不好你搽着瞧罷。』我欣然接受。連搽一月。這十數年來不治的雀斑。竟然淡去了十，之七八。後來叉續向上海法租界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社。購了一瓶。化就把餘剩的一概掃除。這『面麗』的功力。可眞不小。外子曾對我說及。責刋常有這種文字發表。也叫我做一點來投寄。算是小小的一個崇功報德的意思。所以不辭文黑之陋。做了這一篇。</p>
<h3>女子淋疾</h3>
<p>— （振平）</p>
<p>女子之淋疾。多為男子所傳染。蓋男子宿娼。感染淋疾。秘不醫治。或醫治未斷根。必傳染於其妻。輕症者尙不過為陰道與尿道炎。及子宮頸管淋等。症重者延及於不宮腔。輸卵管。卵巢及復胰。而發生劇重之炎症。有急性與慢性期。其症狀為白色黏液分泌物之特別增多。內部腫脹壓痛。兼有小骨盤與薦骨部之引痛。全身營養不良。而神經系統。被其影響頗大。若不醫治。生育亦必致絕望。况男子之患淋病而已染及其妻者。雖單獨治愈。亦必重被妻之反染。則互相傳授。貽害有不勝言矣。故事後療治。實萬不可忽略而延緩。治療方法之最簡易而求其斷根之迅速者。莫如同時服用『內服白帶丸』與『外用白帶藥』。如此內外兼治。功效實最確切。且可永免種種併發症也。該兩藥每種各售二元。現由上海法大馬路。西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社獨家經售云。</p>
<h3>甘露愈我頸癬</h3>
<p>— 謝玉麐自鴛湖寄</p>
<p>兩年前。在頸項間生了幾塊像癬的東西。奇癢難忍。初起時一小圓塊。比扁荳大一些。後來漸决擴大了。癢也比先前更加甚了。上面覆着銀白色的鱗屑。倘若把鱗屑剝去。就有血痕現出來。天冷的時候還好。到了春暖的時期。就癢得無可再忍了。我也曾看過醫生。他說是癬。是因為齷齪不淸潔的綠故。但是看了幾决。終沒見好。後來寫信到醫藥特刊去問編者先生。承他指示。囑我購用『甘露藥水』。我就向上海同仁西藥社去買了一瓶。試用之後。果然靈騐。不到一星期。患處的癬。就由淡而滅。更無幾時。全部多給治愈了。這常感謝編者先生。更當謝謝『甘露』。如此良藥。是應該使大衆知道的。所以寫了這一大篇。大概編者先生。總能答應把他登出的吧。</p>

<h3>胃必靈屢試皆騐</h3>
<p>— （馮啓東來稿）</p>
<p>『胃必靈』三字。雖然常常在報上看到。但是究竟靈與吾。却還不得而知。想一般在未試過前。當同有這感想的。去年底。家祖母忽發胃痛。她雖然曾有過這老病。但巳三四年不發。會卒間幾乎無法應付。偶然想起了這『胃必靈』一藥。就令僕役立刻去買了一盒。服後數分鐘內。果然就止了。後來雖然又痛過一决。但數服後至今却就沒有發過。在新年裏。家嫂因為正在懷孕時期。食慾大减。而且稍食卽嘔吐。人家都說她是胎氣。我就說。不如服一點『胃必靈』看。家母因為嫂子是受孕。極力反對服這藥。後來倒是家嫂說。橫直這藥孕婦是不忌的。服了看。不想服後也就好了。我因此就很相信這藥。有時胸中不適。或是飽脹吐酸。終要去顧問這『胃必靈』。這樣屢試皆騐的良藥。豈可不使大家知道。</p>

<h3>「海女實演」和「機器實騐」的實情實報</h3>
<p>— 包報探</p>
<p>在那些我們覺得很有價値而其實無裨實用的古物平安回國以後，我們又曾參加了兩個値得注意的展覽會。一個是內中包含着民族痛史的「中華文物展覽會」，一個便是佔地十餘畝，陳列機器數百件，足以表現日本重工業凌駕歐美的「日本機器實騐博覽會」。大的主持這會的當局也很知道枯燥的機器試騐恐不足以吸引中華觀衆吧？因此在華文報上也登着大幅的桃色廣吿：「裸體日本美人魚——海女水中妙技，…千載良機，切勿錯過。」</p>
<p>在所謂「神秘之街」的北叫川路上，除了「一二八」的非常事件外，道也要算是一樁哄動全滬的玩意兒了。記者必然是身先大衆，所以我便特往參觀。到了橫洪橋南首，老遠已經看見那座臨時建成的會所，外形很像一　大影戲院，當中一座高大門樓，兩旁各有兩扇較小的大門，但僅由中間一門出入。門外高牆上：右面用中文標出會名；左面則用英文標出，遠遠地就可以看得見。入門券圾初是四角，現减爲成人二角，小孩一角。進了正門，一眼便看見兩幅中國式大紅喜幛高高的掛着：一幅是本市市長吳鐵城具名送的，當中四個大金字爲「闈明學術」；另一個是市府參事王長春具名送的，當中五個大金字是「人巧奪天工」。在這一間如同門堂的室中央，陳列着日本鐵道省博物館的電氣機開車，客車和信號裝置模型。那是用木質做成的一個大環形座子，彩繪成鐵道土基與地　之狀，上鋪設小型鐵道。電氣機關車拖着客車便在那鐵道上走着。在鐵道旁架着電綫桿木，每隔三四尺一根，又在隔兩根電桿處裝上紅綠信號燈，但不用人管理，等到車快到那根裝信號的電桿時，紅綠燈會自動的開關。那是表明在每個路口不必用指揮警和柵攔，便可使行人竚立等候外車通過，二且在信號開關時還附帶有振鈴聲音，更可使人警覺。據說這是預備將米改良火中爲流綫型蒸汽機關車的準備</p>
<p>這一模型的北陳列着大連汽船株式　社的輪船模型。上面的DKK三簡字躍入眼簾，使我聯想起日本NYK郵船會社的宣傳：」陽光所到處，必有NYK旗幟飄揚！」</p>
<p>由此向南得長走廊，中為人行道，兩旁均有工商品陳列所。第一部分稱A區，計有日，華文打字機，鉛字製造機，日本製鐵株式會社自製的鋼軌條，日立製作所之各種電氣機器，山瀨鐵工所之熱氣燙衣機，沸水機，以及其他日商廠家自製的水汀，留聲機，紡織機零件，建築用品，鐵路用錬條製造機，移動起重機器，電球（燈泡）及電扇，馬達等。</p>
<p>第二部分由第一部分終點轉灣向西，稱B區。起點陳列自動紡織機一部，由一中國女工主持試騐，觀者極爲擁擠。鈴木式的毛綿及人造絲紡緞機亦由二女華工當場施用，織成花格子布及人造絲衣料多種，供人觀摩。著名印刷界之堀井謄寫堂，除陳列改良的謄寫版外，並當面試騐其新型輪轉謄寫機，係用電力自動，每分鐘最快速度能印出極鮮明的印刷品一百張，至少每分鍊也能印四十張。如用特製的臘紙，更可用打字機打字於上，印成後與排鉛字的書版無異。其次是出光商店之機油，礦油；昌運工作所之車床，電動鑽孔機；以及鷲野商店之高速度電動金屬切鋸機（此器能將金屬如鋼鐵條等切斷鋸斷），輕便電動送風機，刨床，磅秤等。其旁陳列着六甲式各色（綠，黃，稷）屋瓦波形瓦。再其决是隆記經銷的噴漆，烘漆，鋼條，鋼絲繩，膠布管，斯必靈彈簧板，彈子盤，消火器，噴霧器，砂輪（磨刀銼等用）鋸條，銅絲布，橡皮製造品等。其中以瓦西諾空氣壓榨機及奈良式自由碎粉機爲最有趣，試騐時圍觀者甚衆。空氣壓榨時使人感到平常不知不覺的空氣生活之重要；碎粉機則可將一切原料輾碎成百分之九十七的屑，最小可小到一公厘的十分之三，山斯古林軟鋼板製成的鐵篩小孔中漏下，此孔之細幾爲人目所不能見，人手所摸不出，又如無孔。</p>
<p>還有一種新奇驚人的光學警衛網，那眞是二十世紀巧奪天工的東西。這種光學器具是利用赤外綫攝影作用，外形如一攝　機，該機和警鈴與一種特殊閃光是三位一體的。如果有一個人影經過這受光器可以攝到的範圍，則警鈴立　響了；裝置着的閃光器也便一陣陣地閃爍起光來。這即是說，如果你裝了一具這樣的機械在家裏必須通行的地方，那現實社會所產生的强盜竊賊是休想暗地裏溜到你屋子裏來。這種機械的裝置現已經日本東京電氣株式會社硏究完畢，定名爲「警報器」，分爲近距離，遠距離，巾距離三種。近距離又可分爲五米（約十六尺），一百米兩種；中距離分爲三百米，六百米兩種；遠距離則僅有一千二百米一種。無論宅道，庭園，樹木，高大建築物，假山等處均可裝置。通夜用電，每月僅需二元餘日金。（的合國幣一元八角）該項機械經陳列處管理者當場試騐，只要向該器對立，即聞鈴聲大作，閃光忽忽，殊覺奇妙可驚也。</p>
<p>第三部稱C區，所陳列的均爲工作機器，且大部分爲原動機（主力機），中如豐田製造的精細紡織機，即日商在滬著名紡織廠如豐由等所採用者，餘如大阪若山鐵工所之重工業原動機，且行銷英，美諸先進國矣。長谷川製冰機及冷藏裝置鐵工所，計陳列眞空透視電氣冰箱一座，說明此箱之玻璃層完全眞空，不特美觀，而且可隨意窺見內中食物。還有一架製冰機亦經當場試騐，計一匹馬力者每一日夜可製冰棒（加糖，菓汁，小竹棒等）五千支；二匹馬力者可製一萬支。此種冰棒，會場中亦有出售，每支計洋三分，食之尙覺淸凉可口。</p>
<p>此外如石川烏造船所之大規模重工業自製機械則用照片陳列，名目繁多，不勝枚舉。玉屋式測量製圖及氣象觀測用器械，亦多精品：如焦點察視鏡，小型經緯儀，改良水準儀，航海用測徽器，平地定方器，袖珍測量儀，地極測面器，校正彎曲尺等無不應有盡有。餘則有指芳撚絲機，研磨砥石，碍子濾通器等。</p>
<p>第叫部稱D區，爲會場最後陳列處。首爲日產自働車（汽車）陳列處，有大德勝牌客車及卡車多具。其原料及零件均用日本國產的阪神提賽爾引擎，日本電池，松原鐵工所鍊條，日本國產羅爾及柯步林，日本比斯登林古株式會社汽車零件等。三菱重工業會社所製的提賽爾引擎公共汽車，可坐二十人，車爲一九三六年最新流綫型式，鬆漆精緻美觀，內部裝璜華鼎，確可與歐美以品相頡頑。其次是久保田鐵工所製迭的提賽爾引擎發動機，中最農具硏究所改良引水馬達及農具。　神之本堤土爾引擎原動機，主用於船舶，餘則日本之發電廠，製冰廠，紡織廠，製粉廠，均大量採用，可不必仰給於外商。又有三井洋行經理的日本巴組鐵工所製造的飛行機格納庫，與三菱經理的野上式自動織機，久保田自來水鐵管等，均爲特殊的發明製作品。</p>
<p>從會場走廊出口到了一個長方形的大天井中，看見沿走廊外擺設了不少的貨攤，全是日本小工藝及雜項製作品販賣處：如化妝品，領帶，假象牙玩具，鑲嵌殊寳的手飾，鹿皮袋，漆布袋，咖啡，刨菜銅皮等，均有小商人在場說明及表演使用法等。惟此等小共藝我國也有很多常見的出品，所以在這裏恕不一一詳述了。</p>
<p>最後，便又破費了兩角錢，很興奮地進了那座含有誘惑性的「海女實演館」，那是用席蓬搭或的臨時小戲院型，內裏用黑布襯着，看客座位是一修條的長木板凳。所謂海女游泳處，是形如一個大方形魚缸似的用大玻璃鑲成的一個水池，約有一丈五六尺深的水。先由兩個人用日語及華語報吿以後，即由水池最上方跳下兩個女子來，但並非裸體，而且也不穿游泳水，上身穿着白色短衫，下身圍着紅裙，面部還帶着玻璃罩。在水裏穿梭似的遊來遊去，翻觔斗，豎蜻蜓，又潛伏在圾低處猜拳，打滾。只是兩手和兩足赤露，但因爲水浸透了衣裙，所以豐滿的胸部和腹臀等處曲線却也淸楚可辨。不過仍有許多帶着色情希冀而來的看客不免因失望面噓噓　聲的。</p>
<p>在水池之旁有一處出售蚌珠。在長櫃台中閒用木質水盆盛着一盆蚌蛤，大的圓徑的三寸，小的的一寸，中閒也有長方形的。一個日本　人和一個中國女人在那裹招徠顧客，他們說「眞珠是一粒砂石在蚌的腹內得牠涎水所養成，並請在盒內選購蚌蛤，每只兩元，如果你運氣好，或者開一個蚌會得到兩顆大眞珠；即使開一個沒有，還可讓你再開一個，至少是使你一點也不會吃虧！」但買的人到底少。櫃台北面陳列着一串串穿起來的眞珠和單獨一顆顆較大的眞珠，價値從十槐到一百八十多塊錢不等。還陳列着許多大小蚌壳，表明蚌珠在小蚌腹內生長，從一月到幾年的加大情形，仔細看看，覺得頗爲有趣。這一决的巡禮使我君出日人對於工商　經營的努力，和他們招徠顧客的得法；但也可以看出其中許多賣弄玄虛的生意經，和現社會大多數人購買力的薄弱與减退。</p>
<p>徵求職業　某女士，浙籍，年二十二，現肄業于滬上某大學，三年級程度，今願利用暑期內擔任臨時工作，如家庭暑期補習敎師及各機關臨時抄寫等均可，薪金不計，通訊處西門外肇周路養仁坊四號陸伯平先生收轉。</p>
<p>國際情報</p>
<h3>蘇聯及其他各國的電力政策</h3>
<p>— 歐陽林</p>
<p>完全電氣化時代之出現，不消說是要在資本主義成為了歷史的記載以後才行；因為資本主義生產之無政府主義的狀態，阻碍了生產力得向着更高階段發展，使人類沒有可能完全利用電氣能力。不過，目前世界各國，特別是各主要的先進國家巳走到了部分的電氣化時代，這却是不能而且也無須否認的事實。假使利用電力是生產動力發展的最高階段，那各國電氣事業發展的情形便可表現出它們的經濟狀態；對於它們所施行的電力政策的探究，更是可以使我們明白其經濟發展之趨勢的。</p>
<p>資本主義發展到了最高階段的國家不消說是美國，因而它的電力發展較之其他資本主義國家在程度上也要高些。據一九三四年的統計，美國的發電力量，火力和水力的合計是九〇。九一一百萬K。W。H；消費量總共是七〇。八二〇百萬K。W。H，其中消費於一般工業的佔百分之五一。二，消費於交通的佔百分之七。一，消費於農業及共他的佔百分之四〇。七。這個總的數字比較共他各資本主義國家的都要大。至於電力的統制者，那並不是國家，而是少數的大的資本集團；全美電氣事業，其中有百分之九四。三一便是在四個大的資本集團支配之下的。</p>
<p>在過去，美國國家對於電氣事業可說一向採取放任政策。但是，隨着經濟危機的發展，使這資本主義的王國也不得不對於一般經濟生活採取干涉政策，因而電氣事業也就由國家與以統制了；這一事實在羅斯福的所謂新政中表現了出來。</p>
<p>在羅斯爾的所謂新政之下，美國國家對於電氣事業的統制，表面上所表現出來的是依據公益事業法排除從來的資本的支配力，而以消費者的利益爲主眼的國家的統制電氣事業；這樣，以企圖電氣利用的普遍化。爲了這個企圖，美政府在農村電氣化的十年計劃下要支出四千萬美圓。但是，在實際上，這種對於電氣事業的統制只不過是人爲的恐慌克服的一種方策，而且是扶助壟斷資本的。</p>
<p>其次是德國，這是資本主義的重工業國家，它的電氣事業向來就是比較發達的。在一九三三年時，牠的發電力量，水力和火力的合計是二五。六二二百萬K。W。H；消費量是二二。七七〇百萬K。W。H，就中一般工業消費的佔百分之七九。五，交通佔百分之六。四，農業佔百分之二。〇，其他佔白分之一二。一。這　總數，比較同期的其他資本主義國家的，僅小於美國；最近兩年來它這數目字當然是更大了，因爲近年來德國正在拚命發展軍事工業，擴充軍備，正在努力準備戰爭，其所需要的電力不消說是要更多的。</p>
<p>從來德國的電氣事業有國營，州營，市營，村營，私營種種；但隨着德國資本主義的發展，許多小的經營已逐漸爲大資本所併吞了；所以目前德國的電氣事業也是統制在少數資本集團之下的。同時，希特勒登台以後所施行的電力政策，也是在政府的統制電氣事業之下對於少數大的資本集團的扶助；這僩政策乃是　一九三五年十二月十三日决定的「動力經濟法」所確立的。</p>
<p>在資本主義國家中，法蘭西的電氣事業之發展當然也是値得注意的。不過，嚴格說來，法國還沒有具體化了的國家的電力政策，它只有部分的水力法，送電事　機關的法律；而且這些也不如美國的由政府干涉電氣事業的政策之明顯。</p>
<p>法國的常氣事業主要的都是火力發電。它的發電資源是北部所產的石炭。至發電水力，則保藏於阿爾卑斯，皮列勒山脈及中央高地地帶的三個地方，其發電能力的有五百萬且羅瓦特。在一九三三年度的法國發電狀態，依據火力的計有八十三億一千萬且羅時（Kilo　watt　hour），水力的六十五億五千萬且羅時，輸入（主要是由瑞十)四億四千五百萬且羅時，合計白五十三億五百萬且羅時；在這中間火力發電量佔百分之五四强。至於消費狀熊，則一般用的計有七十四億一千五百萬且羅時，炭坑用的十四億三千萬且羅時，冶鐵工　用的十億七千五百萬且羅時，電氣化學工業川的二十億一千五百萬且羅時，交通業用的八億七千五百萬且羅時。</p>
<p>對於法國的有關電力的主要法規之精神，我們可以簡單叙述如左：</p>
<p>一，一九一九年十月公布的發電水力法規定：「水力是國家的重要資源，其開發利用，私人不得獨佔利益」。因此，對於水力的開發，必要求得國家的特許。道個特許的條件主要的是開發的電力之一部有提供公共用的義務，以及七十五年的特許期間經過後，無代價的歸還國家所有。</p>
<p>二，關於送電及連絡送電綫的法律，在一九二二年七月十九日及一九二三年四月二十三日都有所公布，但這些法律都還說不上是國家的整個具體化德電力政策，當然更不能說是國家對於電氣事業的統制。</p>
<p>直到現在，法國的電氣事業還是由民間事業者的相互協定而進行經營的。要說明這個現象，只有詳細去考察戰後法國的經濟情形，但這不是本題的任務。</p>
<p>此外，在資本主義國家中，英國和日本對於電氣事業也採取着統制政策。但這種政策也同樣是對於大資本集團的幫助，使壟斷事　得以向前發展。如日本，國家對於電氣事業者曾明文保證供給區域的獨佔。</p>
<p>最後要說的是蘇聯對於電氣化的努力。我們在本文開始的時候就巳經指出，資本主義國家因爲生產之無政府主義的狀態，所以不能完全電氣化。但蘇聯的新的計劃經濟却沒有這種病害，因而它電氣化的速度是很驚人的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的創造者伊里支曾認爲電氣化是和們的「第二黨綱」，說全國電氣化是他們的主義的一個主要內容，因此，蘇聯人民對於電氣化的工作特別努力，他們所獲得的成績也特別可觀。事實的表現是：在資本主義世界經濟大恐慌期中，蘇聯電氣化的數目字的發展呈現出了如下可驚的狀態：</p>
<p>（以上是對上一年的百分比</p>
<p>誰都知道，蘇聯經濟建設所表現出來的具的成績，是第一五年計劃的完成和第二五年計劃的開展。在這中間，電氣化的成績也有驚人的表現。當第一五年計劃完成時，蘇聯發電所之發電力爲七百萬且羅瓦特，至第二五年計劃完成時將達到四千至五千萬且羅瓦特。依預定計劃，在一九四〇年時，蘇聯電氣化的基準數字是七千至七千五百萬且羅瓦特，但在一九三〇年，資本主義發展到了最高點的美國之發電力才只三千六百三十萬且羅瓦特；兩者相較，則在八年至十年間蘇聯在發電力方面不僅可追上了美國，而且將超過它那水準的二倍。</p>

<h3>深山裏的美人</h3>
<p>— 聯芳</p>
<p>昆明通訉</p>
<p>沒有到過雲南的人，一提起雲南，總覺得有些害怕；彷彿那地方在得很遠，又野蠻，又有毒瘴，從來沒有人敢去，去了便會死。所以從前的「新豐老翁」一聽見隊伍要開到雲南去，寧願抱起一塊石頭來將胳肺軋斷，不願隨着隊伍去送死。</p>
<p>這種對雲南的恐怖和成見歷來就很厲害的，其實，雲南何嘗像他們所想像的那般？</p>
<p>雲南是有他的特殊風味的，在這滿是龐大的高山和原始一般的大自然界中，雖然顯得有點蠻荒强悍，但却有不少你想像小到的「山明水秀」的地方。譬如昆明吧，你想牠是一個什麽地方呢？牠是一個</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>躲在深山裏，還沒有被人發見的美人，雖然打扮得有些不大入時，但也儘夠你陶醉了。</p>
<p>當一個旅人拖着那末一副疲乏的身軀，孤零零地給滇越車帶到了昆明時，牠會給你甜蜜的溫存，好像就是你久別的情婦一樣，隨着你的喜歡，牠無不使你滿意。</p>
<p>你若是一位都市的崇拜者，你到了昆明，你不會覺得牠連一點都市的氣息也沒有的。在這裏有着整齊的西式商店；寬闊平坦的馬路；汽車，黃包車，腳踏車，不絕的往來這；趕熱鬧的人們那麼擁擠的走在街的兩旁。馬路兩旁的商店陳列着耀人眼目的商品，留聲機的清聲，不斷的從掛着廉價招牌的商店裏播送出啦，顯得那麼怪熱鬧的。</p>
<p>從白天到夜晚，老是擠着一堆人的地方，是沒有悲哀的遊戲場裏。這裏有着一個有聲電影院和一個無聲電影院，戲院也是有着一個唱京戲的和一個唱滇戲的。除此，患有許多唱板凳戲的小茶園，那是只要泡上一壺茶，就可以坐着聽聽的。</p>
<p>奢華的大酒館，清雅的咖啡店，這地方也具備得有，可惜沒有女招待，不　然，倒很夠一般花花公子們樂意了。</p>
<p>除此面外，到昆明來換不能不游一游的，是林木幽　的西山，和吳三桂在那裏登過龍位的金殿。清涼幽雅的黑龍潭和羅漢很多的竹築寺，那也值得玩玩的。</p>
<p>昆明人都生得一張會說話的嘴巴子，一個人同一個人見着，客氣得要命，即使在同一家庭裏，也是那麼嚕喱嚕　不怕人難為情的怪客氣。但偶然因着一點小事，他們也會吵到一兩個鐘頭不息的。</p>
<p>昆明的氣候變化得很快，在清明的時候天氣很暖和，可是一下起雨來便有些清冷了，所以昆明有句俗語云：［四季無寒暑，一雨變成冬］。記得一個到雲南旅行過的外國人會這麼說，在昆明每天在街上走着，非叫一個隨行者把一年四季的衣服都完全揹着跟你走不可。這話真是不錯。可是昆明的天氣是沒有北方那麼大寒大熱的，在極熱的時候熱度不上八十度，冬天冷的時候已不容易見到雪，一年到頭差不多都是春天一般的天氣呵。</p>

<h3>禿頭者的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 偉烈</p>
<p>誰不說麗麗是個美人胎子，但也許是麗麗生得太美麗了吧？遭了老天的妒忌，竟　給她一個光亮　目，童山濯濯；葫蘆殼似的和尚頭，而剝奪了她烏雲似的一頭黑髮。</p>
<p>當然嗎！麗麗不是生下來就是禿頭的，雖然她的頭髮是比較稀少些，可是烏黑的頭髮輕輕的覆在頭頂上，　　她那只討人喜歡的臉蛋兒，到也蠻有樣的，看上去也並不十分稀疏，無如［天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福］，她在十八歲的那年秋天，害了一場很厲害的傷寒症，花費了她爸爸許多金錢，流去了她媽媽不少眼淚，好容易把她一條小命兒從鬼門關拖了回來，可是她那美麗的一束頭髮却永遠掛在鬼門關上而不想回來了，這樣，麗麗就成了一個未老先衰的禿頭女子了。</p>
<p>她是這樣的傷心，這樣的難受，整天的痛苦着，尋死尋活的吵鬧着。她說：［生在世上活現世，還不是死了的乾淨，像我那副　樣兒，還能夠見人嗎？還是死了吧！還是死了吧！］可是她到底沒有死，並且活到了現在。這一半當然是因為人類有好生惡死的天性，一半也也仗她爸爸有錢。</p>
<p>當麗麗刚成秃頭的時候，她爸爸愛他的寶貝女兒，不惜化費許多金錢替她醫治，什麼中酱，西醫，美容院，膏藥，電氧治療，生髮藥水，生髮油……一天星斗，結果麗魇的禿须因受刺激而更亮更光了，而麗麓的頭髮却始終頑固的不肯長出來。</p>
<p>治本沒有辦法，只有治標了，所以麗腊頭上不論寒，暑，晨，夕，都戴着帽子，就是睡的時候也像初生婴兒般的戴着睡帽。但是她的頭實在太光了，雖然戴了帽子，仍掩不住她後頸和耳朶旁的光禿處，不男不女的怪模樣，不要說別人看丁好笑，就是麗麗目己也覺得怪醜陋的。最後，還是法幣有靈，化了一百塊錢到美容院去裝了一頭假髮，不過晚上須把假髮拿下來後宁可睡，因為在睡的時候容易把假髮弄壞或脫落。</p>
<p>現在麗麗仍舊是個美麗的十全十美的麗麗了，因為金錢已彌補丁她的缺陷。她不但有了一頭卷曲的青黑潤澤的美髮，並且還能随心所欲的改變頭髮的顏色和式樣。今天她穿一件　着盤龍的旗袍，她就裝一頭烏光漆亮的黑頭髮。明天她换一件袒胸露肩的西裝，她就裝一頭金色燦爛的黃頭髮，在歪戴着的帽子下面，露出那麼一束金絲般的黃頭髮，多漂亮呀！雖然假頭髮沒有真頭髮那麼自然，但，總比禿頭好得多了，尤其是戴着帽子，在耳朵下露出一束頭髮，誰知道她這頭髮是具的還是假的，所以麗麗仍舊恢復了昔日的愉快和歡樂。</p>
<p>麗麗為了她的禿頭，不知吃了多少苦，淌了多少眼淚，所以她對於一切禿頭的人都沒有好感，她恨尼姑，恨和尚，恨禿頭的老年人，甚至恨滿月的新剃頭的小嬰兒。每逢蓮花庵的尼姑妙貞來拜訪她媽媽時，她總是很冷淡的接待她——從前和她很親人的，時常到她庵裏去玩——並且常在她媽面前說尼姑的壞話，用很冠冕堂皇的話勸她媽別和尼姑來往。她不願去參加人家做佛事做道場，因為那裏和尚尼姑太多了。她不願禿頭的老媽子侍候她，她不喜歡那才滿月新剃頭的小侄兒。因為他們正大光明，不用躲躲藏藏的禿頭。給她一種威脅，一種譏諷，一種羞慚。她不願看見她們，甚至不愛聽見關於他們的一切，尤其怕別人提到尼姑，她的理由是：［女子都是有頭髮的，尼姑是女子中唯一的禿頭，她也是禿頭，豈不是她也做了尼姑？］</p>
<p>為了禿頭的緣故，麗麗已失學一年多了，這在麗麗的爸媽是滿不在乎的，又不要女兒家賺錢來養活爸媽，識得幾個字，會寫寫信就行啦！好在家中有的是錢，在家陪伴老母，過着小姐的享福生活不是很好嗎？可是在外邊跑慣了的麗麗，為了禿頭沒奈何在家內關了一年多，實在氣悶極了，一一隻活潑的小鳥關在金絲籠內是多麼的難受呀！她需要呼吸自由的空氣，所以麗麗就要求她爸媽仍給她進學校去念書去，於是她又恢復了她一年前的學校生活，因為她現在已恢復原有的美麗了，她可以見人面了，假頭髮已彌補了她的缺陷。她仍是這樣的可愛，這樣的迷人，在不知道她底細的人，那裏曉得這個美人兒却有個葫蘆殼的禿頭呢？</p>
<p>［少年男子那個不善鐘情，妙齡女子那個不善懷春。］我們的麗麗正當妙齡，況又長着一副俏麗的臉和一個玲瓏的心。她懂得怎樣戀愛，她懂得男子的心理，她懂得用什麼手段可以使男子伏伏貼貼的拜倒在她的高跟鞋之下，她也知道怎樣利用光頭下的俏面　使男子傾倒。她　要來調劑她枯燥單調的生活，所以她在課餘假日，老是混在男子堆中談，笑，玩，她和張好，也和李好，她愛王的小白臉，也愛陳的印度黑炭，她喜歡孟的壯士風，她傾心章是個文學家，她也崇拜魏是個藝術家。她不和誰特別好，也不特別懷，她不親近誰，也不冷淡誰，什麼人都是一視同仁的。</p>
<p>麗麗雖喜歡同男子們一起談，笑，玩，可是她不願接受誰的愛。當某一個男子為他的美麗活潑而迷惑，把一顆赤紅熱烈的心，雙手捧着獻在她面前時，她却傲然的給他一個不理睬，甚至不惜重重的把他這顆愛戀的心捏的粉碎。當然囉，在這種情形之下，那男子是抱着一顆粉碎的創傷的心憔悴了。麗麗却也淒然的獨自個兒躲在床上痛哭，因為她愛和他和他愛她一樣，她願意接受他的愛。可是她想到她光可鑑人的禿頭，她氣沮，她心痛了，最後她就淒然的拒絕了他的愛，因為她明白一個禿頭女子是不配接受男子的愛的，她之所以受男子熱烈的愛戀追求，為的是男子不知道她是個禿頭女子，她不相信一個像她那樣殘廢的女子能夠得到男子永遠的愛的。況且男子是因她的美麗而愛她，若知道她是個比普通人更醜陋十倍的禿頭女人，這建築在［美］上面的愛，立刻便會像太陽中的雪人一般的融化了，瓦解了，消滅了。與其將來被遺棄於後，飽嘗失戀的痛苦，還不如在前決定不接受任何人的愛為妙。但是她仍願和男子在一起談，笑，玩，也時常把男子獻給她的愛毅然拒絕了。</p>
<p>高中畢業後她進大學，大學畢業後她就在××銀行服務，她現在已經有二十七歲了，但她的美麗却並沒有隨年華的增長而又所減損，她在情場中仍舊佔着勝利，仍舊能夠很容易的抓住男子的心。可是她仍是個獨身者，是個老處女，因為她那一片荒漠，不生草木的禿頭使她失去了接受任何男子的愛戀的勇氣。</p>

<h3>德國舊有殖民地概況</h3>
<p>— 彭生</p>
<p>一九一四—一八年空前的世界大戰，誰都知道是帝國主義爭奪市場，爭奪殖民地的戰爭；這戰爭的結果之一是德國喪失了許多領土和殖民地。但德國却並未因此就消除了它的野心和戰門能力，它是正在準備再在世界戰場上來顯示自己的威風的。現在，希特勒已向世界提出了收復殖民地或世界殖民地再分割的問題，使二次世界大戰的危機更加緊迫了。</p>
<p>但是，舊有的德國殖民地分散在那些地方呢？它的情形如何呢？這一向還少人具體講述過，然而這却是每一個關心世界問題者所必須知道的事。</p>
<p>戰前德國在菲洲，澳洲，亞洲等處共有殖民地一，一四〇，一一七平方哩，其中居住的人口總計一三，二五八，〇〇〇人。戰後由於凡爾賽條約成立，這些殖民地都為英法等國所領有了。總計這些殖民地在菲洲的有多哥蘭，加麥隆，西南菲洲，坦葛尼　（　德領東菲洲）：在澳洲的有紐幾尼亞（巴布亞島之東北部），桑羅蒙，加羅林，馬少爾桑島，三毛亞準島；在亞洲的，有　州灣。茲將這些地方的各種情緒略分述如下：</p>
<p>多哥蘭　這個地方的面積計有三萬二千八百平方哩，是在一八八四年七月由西菲洲德總領事那哈太加爾博士宣言佔領的。戰後由凡爾賽條約分割為二：一部分歸發領西菲洲的達　美：就中英國所統治的領域面積約一二，六〇〇平方哩，人口三五九，〇〇〇，法國所統治面積約二一，二〇〇平方哩，人口六</p>

Four Japanese soldiers guarding the house refused to return the horses to the Chinese soldiers. The Chinese military authorities then sent a squad leader with a small squad of soldiers to retrieve the horses. The Japanese authorities in Beiping then sent a military officer to Fengtai to investigate the matter. The officer went to the headquarters of the Chinese army, saying that the Chinese soldiers entering the Japanese barracks was an "insult to the Japanese nation." Imai, the Japanese military attache stationed in Beiping, has lodged a protest with the Diplomatic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council regarding this matter. The committee is currently investigating. As for the Japanese claim that the Japanese military officer who went to Fengtai to investigate this matter was arrested by the Chinese military authorities, the Chinese authorities here have firmly denied this. The Japanese side claims that this case will be negotiated by the Tianjin Japanese Army Command and Song Zheyuan. Furthermore, two Japanese cruisers left Lushun last night, one heading for Qingdao and the other for Dagu, carrying several naval officers specially dispatched to investigate the Japanese ship attack case. It is said that several other warships are prepared to set sail as soon as they receive orders. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>What Will Be the Response of the Guangdong and Guangxi Authorities?</h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued his statement on the policy of dealing with Guangdong and Guangxi, the whole country has been looking forward to the response of the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities. Judging from the phrase "specifically seek the sincere and faithful response of the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities with a most sincere and frank heart" in the third section of the statement, the relationship that this policy can have on the current situation will depend on how the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities respond. The meaning of the words is quite obvious.</p>
<p>The reporter now raises three points based on the original text of the statement to question the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities. First, the country is now capable of "sincere unity", while "mutual disruption" will lead to chaos. Now the central government has expressed its determination to implement a policy of peaceful unification. Which path do Guangdong and Guangxi want to follow? Second, since the central government has clearly stated that "there is a possibility of respecting local conditions within a unified country," it is not difficult to obtain the most appropriate method through open and honest consultations. Can Guangdong and Guangxi support the central government in a legitimate way? Third, the unification of military orders and the obedience to national policies are matters of discipline and are beyond doubt. How do the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities plan to act under the explicit statement that "the past will not be pursued, nor will troops from other provinces be allowed to enter Guangdong and Guangxi"? There is nothing mysterious in these questions. If Guangdong and Guangxi attach importance to the overall situation of the country, then the unity of the country, the presentation and discussion of local environmental issues, and the respect for national discipline can all be answered directly. Otherwise, if their arguments are unjust, they will inevitably be held responsible for the crisis in the country.</p>
<p>The Guangdong and Guangxi movements are revealing their medicinal properties and seeking the sympathy of the people, but the truth is difficult to hide. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the presidents of six universities sent a telegram to Chen, Li, and Bai, saying, "Avoiding domestic wars and preserving the country's vitality are the common psychology of the people of the whole country today." If the parties involved do not know how to change their ways, it is no different from fighting against the will of the people. Those who distance themselves from the will of the people will inevitably fail. We have repeatedly stated that the brightness and darkness of the future are as clear as a torch. Intelligent people should avoid self-isolation. The safety and danger depend on a single thought. Today, the people of the country are still looking forward to the response of the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to the central government's policy, and hope that they still have the opportunity to turn back from the brink. We deeply hope that they will no longer lose their chance and have a satisfactory response to explain their actions of changing their ways.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses Amendment to the Covenant - Decides to Submit to General Assembly for Discussion, Italian-Abyssinian Case Also to Be Handled by General Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting today. The Chilean representative proposed an amendment to the League of Nations Covenant, stating that the general responsibilities borne by member states could lead to involvement in wars that have no direct or indirect connection to their own countries. This is a real danger, and it is now necessary to allow a part of humanity, even when facing disaster, to remain outside the dispute. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov expressed the opinion that the League has not failed, but that the instruments provided by the League have not been utilized by the various countries. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu delivered a passionate speech, stating that it is unfair to attack the League itself instead of criticizing those who implement the Covenant. The Little Entente countries can only accept suggestions that increase the strength of the League, and will never agree to suggestions that involve the principle of equality among nations. French Foreign Minister Delbos stated that the French government believes that the League cannot be held responsible for recent failures. The recent failures cannot be attributed to the League. The Administrative Council had previously invited Abyssinian representative General Nasibu to attend the meeting, but the discussion of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has been postponed until after the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly on June 30th. (Reuters Dispatch, 35th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened this afternoon, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Eden. Abyssinia was represented by General Nasibu, former commander of the Southern Route Army. The Administrative Council temporarily removed the item on the Italian-Abyssinian issue from the agenda, postponing it for discussion after the League of Nations General Assembly. Subsequently, the Chilean representative Veguña raised the issue of amending the League of Nations Covenant, stating that the League of Nations General Assembly should discuss the matter during its current session or at its regular session in September. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov spoke next, stating that he did not think that the reorganization of the League of Nations would necessarily be beneficial and that it was not easy to reach a conclusion hastily, as the League of Nations of the future might not be superior to the current League of Nations. He also stated that the League of Nations Covenant had not failed, but that the member states had failed to fully implement the various measures contained in the Covenant. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu supported Litvinov's proposal, stating that at this moment, the threat of war is everywhere, and that amending the League of Nations Covenant to the point that the League of Nations cannot fulfill its mission would be inappropriate. He believed that "what should be reformed is the human heart, not the Covenant." He also stated that Romania supports the system of regional agreements, but that peace is a whole and cannot be separated, and that Romania must point this out. As far as the Little Entente countries are concerned, all concrete suggestions are welcome for consideration, but any suggestion that weakens the function of the Covenant will not be accepted. French Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a brief speech, stating that amending the Covenant is a major matter, and that the Administrative Council should not hastily make a decision. Finally, the Administrative Council passed a proposal by Foreign Secretary Eden, deciding that after the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly, this issue should be submitted for discussion first. At today's meeting of the Administrative Council, no decision was made regarding the Locarno Treaty, mostly because Belgian Prime Minister Janson had not yet arrived, and Germany had not yet submitted a reply regarding the British issue. The Administrative Council is now scheduled to continue the meeting on the 29th, and the League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the afternoon of the 30th. The chairman of this General Assembly, Beneš, was elected President of Czechoslovakia at the end of last year and cannot continue to serve as chairman. Another person should be elected to replace him. It is said that the representative of Han Zhou, Bruce, has a high voice for this seat. Some news reports also say that the Greek representative Politis also has hope of being elected. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Again Asks League of Nations to Guarantee Right to Exist - Requests Assistance with Munitions to Resist Aggression, Hopes League of Nations Will Not Succumb to Military Might</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Emperor of Abyssinia recently sent a letter to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, reiterating the country's right to free existence, and stating that there is still a government existing in the western part of the country. The Administrative Council should allow countries to transport arms and military supplies to the country to provide assistance to the government. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Emperor of Abyssinia recently met with reporters in the afternoon and gave a speech in the Abyssinian language, stating, "When you record and express your views, I firmly believe that you will do so with sincerity and a spirit of peace. Those who can follow the right path will eventually have their claims vindicated. This is an immutable truth." At this point, a spokesman for the Abyssinian delegation issued a written statement, reading it aloud to the public, stating, in essence, that those who rely on military force to win are the most violent of all. We hope that the League of Nations will not succumb to them. A government has now been established in the western part of our country. This is the only legitimate government within our country. The League of Nations should not deny it to us, nor should it restrict its actions and allow the government established by the invading country to enjoy benefits. The land occupied by the government of the invading country is only a part of our country, and its power is extremely precarious. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is generally believed that when the League of Nations General Assembly discusses the Italian-Abyssinian issue, Abyssinia will be attended by the Emperor himself or General Nasibu. There is no doubt that the current sanctions will be lifted by the General Assembly at that time. What is not known is whether the General Assembly will condemn Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, or postpone handling it. Regarding this issue, representatives of various countries are currently holding private talks and consultations. As for the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, the General Assembly will choose one of the following two procedures to explore: (1) Immediately amend the Covenant. (2) Organize a committee to study the concrete suggestions that various countries may submit during this session or in September. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Italy Notifies League of Nations That It Will Resume Cooperation with League of Nations Once the International Situation Changes</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the agenda. The Italian representative presented British Foreign Secretary Eden with a letter, worded mildly, explaining the reasons why Italy would not send a delegation to the Administrative Council meeting, and stating that Italy would be able to resume cooperation with the League of Nations once the international situation changes. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano recently sent a letter to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, British Foreign Secretary Eden, stating in essence that under the current circumstances, the Italian delegation would still not be able to send personnel to attend the current session of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, nor would it be able to participate in the discussion of item three on the agenda, the Locarno case. It is hoped that the current situation will quickly clear up, so that Italy can resume cooperation with the League of Nations. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Nicaragua Withdraws from League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Government of Nicaragua recently sent a note to the League of Nations, declaring its withdrawal from the League without stating the reasons. The country joined the League of Nations on November 3, 1926, and has not yet completed ten years. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Polish Government Orders That Sanctions Against Italy Be Lifted First</h3>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters dispatch from Warsaw, the Polish Cabinet, anticipating that the special session of the League of Nations General Assembly will pass a proposal to lift sanctions against Italy, has ordered that they be lifted immediately. This is the first country to lift sanctions against Italy. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Busy Meeting Extracurricularly - Agree on League of Nations Issues</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council did not hold a public meeting today. Representatives of various countries took advantage of the weekend holiday to conduct private talks in order to prepare for the agenda of the League of Nations General Assembly on June 30. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos met with representatives of various countries today, including League of Nations Administrative Council observer for Italy, Scoler, consultant for the Abyssinian delegation Sers (Professor at the University of Paris), Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and Danish Foreign Minister Munch. Munch is said to have expressed agreement with France's proposal that the League of Nations Covenant does not need to be amended, but only needs to be annotated so that no doubts arise during interpretation. As for the conversation between Delbos and Colonel Beck, which lasted about an hour, the activities of the Social Democratic Party in the Free City of Danzig were discussed. Beck did not seem to be very concerned about this matter, believing that relations between Poland and Germany were still amicable, and that any incidents that might occur in the Free City of Danzig would not be difficult to resolve. In addition, regarding the issue of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Beck had already notified the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, British Foreign Secretary Eden, yesterday that the sanctions against Italy should be lifted. During his conversation with Delbos, he reiterated this proposal. Delbos replied that the French government only agreed in principle to the lifting of sanctions and that it would have to be implemented after all relevant countries expressed their views. Beck also said that the Polish government would have to consult its allies, such as France, before deciding on its national position regarding Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. If it can act in concert with its allies at that time, it will be deeply gratified. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently sent a note to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, British Foreign Secretary Eden, stating that the Polish government has decided to lift sanctions against Italy, stating in essence, "The purpose of sanctions was to prevent war and to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute peacefully. This is understood by all members of the League of Nations. However, judging from the current situation, our joint efforts have failed, and the facts are clear and cannot be denied. Therefore, if sanctions were to continue to be implemented, they would become a means of punishment, which is contrary to what is stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and should be lifted. However, I must declare to you on behalf of the Polish government that even though collective action has failed, the Polish government is still happy to participate in all the efforts of the League of Nations, because the League of Nations is an instrument of international cooperation." In addition, Paraguay, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala, Haiti, and other countries in South and Central America have also sent the same note to Eden. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos met with Danish Foreign Minister Munch and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in the morning of today and hosted a banquet for representatives of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente at noon. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum set out for Geneva this morning to attend the extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations and the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. Minister without Portfolio Faure is scheduled to depart tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that Prime Minister Blum will propose in Geneva to organize a committee to study the problem of organizing a European Federation. According to his current plan, this federation will include the member states of the League of Nations and Germany. This proposal by France will probably be presented in the form of informal talks. Blum's plan differs greatly from the one proposed by Foreign Minister Briand several years ago. Briand's proposal was purely political in nature, while Blum considers political problems to be a key problem and focuses on financial and commercial aspects. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, during a speech in his constituency, was protested by a voter against the government's decision to lift sanctions. The Chancellor replied, "If we want to restore Abyssinia to its original state, there is no other way except military intervention. However, looking at the countries of the world, none are prepared to take this kind of action. The facts are clear and obvious. It is regrettable that sanctions ultimately failed. It is normal for those who enthusiastically support the League of Nations to rise up and criticize in disappointment, and I am not surprised. However, the British people should know that joining the war will inevitably lead to the most serious consequences for all concerned. The government must avoid this, and therefore there is no other way but to lift sanctions. There is no shortage of wise people in the United Kingdom. If they calm down and think about it, they will know that my words are not false." (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>法眾院通過法律　取締存欵國外　財長認為整飭國民紀律</h3>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Olivol recently submitted a bill to the Chamber of Deputies stipulating that French citizens with funds deposited abroad must report them to the government before July 15th, without concealment. Those who intentionally evade or fail to report within the deadline will have their property confiscated, with the amount equal to the amount concealed and unreported, and will be deprived of their civil rights. This bill has now been unanimously passed by the Chamber of Deputies with 542 votes to zero. When the Chamber of Deputies discussed this matter today, Finance Minister Olivol attended and explained that this bill is a law to "rectify national discipline." The people of the country now have a spirit of self-confidence. The Finance Minister then explained the financial situation, saying, "Before the 19th of this month, French cash continued to flow out, but in recent days, cash has begun to flow back into the country. On the 24th of this month alone, cash inflows amounted to 350,000,000 francs. At the same time, the market prices of various government bonds have also risen by several points," and so on. In addition, the government previously submitted a bill to the Chamber of Deputies to extend the term of compulsory education, stipulating that the term of compulsory education, which used to end at the age of thirteen, should now be extended by one year, to the age of fourteen. The Chamber of Deputies held a meeting today and has begun to discuss this bill, and it is scheduled to continue to study it next Tuesday. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Finance Minister Vaurivore declared in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon that although the interest rate of French banks has been reduced, the outflow of French cash has been completely stopped. Not only is there no outflow, but there is now an inflow. On Wednesday, gold worth 305,000,000 francs arrived. He also said that there is something more important than this, that is, the long-term interest rates of the pound and the US dollar have both increased greatly. The price of French bonds has been rising recently, and the number of national defense bonds issued has exceeded the number of expenses, which shows that the country is now in a state of unity. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Two other bills to promote government administrative procedures, one for the nationalization of the arms manufacturing industry and one for the relief of unemployed workers, were both passed by the cabinet today and approved by Prime Minister Blum. The public works to relieve unemployment will cost a total of more than 50 million pounds, a third of which will be spent this year. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The bill on large-scale public works proposed by National Economy Minister Spinasse was passed by the cabinet yesterday. It will cost a total of 20,000,000,000 francs, to be paid in three years. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of State recently decided to submit a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies, advocating that all or part of the national military industry be nationalized, and that the state buy back shares at the average price of the past seven years. After the passage of this bill, ten military factories will be nationalized. The important ones are: the famous Schneider Armament Factory, the Hotchkiss Factory, the Blanc Factory, and the Renault Factory. Among them, the Renault Factory's products, automobiles and aircraft engines, are the most important. Weapons only account for 3% of the total output. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of State decided yesterday to submit a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies, advocating that all or part of the national military industry be nationalized. It is known that the cabinet also intends to submit a statement of reasons at the same time as the bill. The content explains that the military industry referred to in the bill refers to the industry that purely manufactures weapons. Other factories, such as those that manufacture aircraft, automobiles, and shotguns, can also supply commercial use in addition to meeting the needs of national defense, so the method of official-merchant cooperation should be adopted. The statement of reasons also states that this bill is based on the international draft agreement on "monitoring the manufacture and sale of arms" of the Disarmament Conference, which will be helpful to the international negotiations on the arms monitoring system.

<h3>法國海軍船塢　八千工人罷工　佔據軍艦高懸紅旗</h3>
<p>(Paris) Eight thousand workers at the Saint-Nazaire shipyard began a "occupation of the shipyard without working" strike today. The shipyard is currently building the battleship Strasbourg and the cruisers Georges Leygues and Marseillaise, which have not yet been completed. Workers blocked the shipyard gates with obstacles and hung red flags to express their dissatisfaction with the slow progress of negotiations to demand that employers improve their treatment. It is heard that strikes have also occurred in other places. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Nine thousand workers at the Saint-Nazaire naval shipyard went on strike suddenly today. There are currently one battleship, two cruisers, and four submarines under construction in the factory. The striking workers occupied two of them and hung red flags. However, the submarines are guarded by the navy. The striking workers in other parts of the country are quite quiet, and today the number has decreased by 180,000.

<h3>英陸軍部調查　各國軍備實况　以備外交參考工作</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible persons recently announced that the British military attachés stationed in various European countries will soon be recalled by the Ministry of War one after another. After the military attachés return to the country, they will report to the authorities in detail on the situation of military preparations in the countries where they are stationed, such as the measures that have been implemented and the plans to maintain future security, without any omission. The government has two purposes in this move: one is to accurately know the current state of military preparations in various European countries, so as to provide a reference for the implementation of foreign policy in the European continent, and the other is to make domestic public opinion have a true and insightful understanding of the international situation. Regarding this matter, the Morning Post published yesterday the amount of German military expenditure (the total amount for this year is 900,000,000 pounds). It is said that this figure was obtained from a semi-official source, which is worthy of being called accurate. The general public attaches great importance to it. In addition, Secretary of War Duff Cooper gave a speech at the Anglo-French Association in Paris the day before yesterday, in which he discussed the issue of German military preparations. It can be clearly seen that all members of the British cabinet are worried about the situation of German rearmament. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>美民主黨大會歡呼聲中　推羅斯福為候選總統　會場景象興奮不可言狀羅斯福到會演說戒備森嚴</h3>
<p>Philadelphia. The Democratic National Convention convened today. Judge Meek proposed to re-elect President Roosevelt as the party's presidential candidate. The scene at the time was indescribably excited. Meek extolled the New Deal, saying that all the progress made was due to the untiring efforts of our leader and his wise cabinet and wise Congress. After Meek's speech, delegations from various states lined up through the venue and the audience gallery, cheering in favor of President Roosevelt. This kind of excited scene lasted for an hour before it ended. It not only broke all previous records of the conference, but also was only seen in the election meeting. However, President Roosevelt still has to struggle hard until November of this year to win. This can be seen from the fact that many people in New York State are betting heavily, betting five to seven that he will be defeated. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia. The Democratic National Convention recently nominated President Roosevelt as the candidate for the next election amidst cheers. Before the election, representatives from various states, both male and female, praised the President's New Deal and social undertakings. Among them, Judge John Mark, who was a childhood friend of the President, proposed to nominate the President as the candidate for the election, and said, "President Roosevelt is a leader enlightened by God, and his task is to lead mankind and fight to the death against special rights. Since 1933, the country's economy and social life have greatly improved. How can it not be the President's credit?" The audience cheered wildly when they heard this. At that time, the venue was originally equipped with sound recording equipment to record the cheers, but it failed to work because the sound was too loud. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia. President Roosevelt was again nominated today as the Democratic candidate by the Democratic National Convention. Before the nomination, Judge Mack stood up and delivered a nomination speech, the general meaning of which was that Roosevelt was the protector of the people. He said that the function of the New Deal was entirely to cut off the monopoly of politics by the privileged class. The question today is whether the government's organization should remain in the hands of the general public, or must it return to the hands of a few who abuse their power to create economic panic. We have eliminated the national hunger problem, and we have brought the country through an unprecedented era of great panic. Now that the preparatory work has been completed, we should complete greater work under Roosevelt's guidance. He also compared the economic situation in 1933 with today, believing that this is a clear proof of Roosevelt's effective administration, so he advocated re-nominating him as a presidential candidate. As soon as his speech was delivered, the Governor of South Dakota, Panley, moved to nominate Roosevelt as a candidate, and the whole venue unanimously cheered and passed it. The chairman of the conference, Ruhansen, formally announced that President Roosevelt was the presidential candidate. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia. President Roosevelt has been officially nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate for the next term. Roosevelt will arrive here tonight to speak at an outdoor conference and accept the election. The authorities are now making strict preparations to protect the head of state. The authorities are keeping the location of the station where President Roosevelt will get off and the time of arrival strictly confidential. Seven hundred police officers, carrying rifles, machine guns, and tear gas bombs, are ordered to be responsible for protecting President Roosevelt. Today, when Judge Meek proposed to nominate President Roosevelt as the candidate for the next presidential election, sixty representatives seconded and supported the proposal. When the members spoke, the representatives from Hawaii played music to add to the fun. The conference adjourned late this morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the observations of neutral parties here, assuming that the Democratic Party wins the election in November, there will be no major changes in the policy towards the Far East. The platform decided by the party congress yesterday did not have any specific suggestions for overseas issues, which is really a point worth noting. However, although the silver issue is not clearly stated in the platform, the policy of silver purchase will of course continue. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Neither the Democratic Party's platform nor the Republican Party's platform has any regulations on the policy of territories and islands. From this point, it can be seen that the next government will have room for flexibility in dealing with the economic relationship of the Philippines, the status of Hawaii, and the issue of full autonomy in Puerto Rico. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The long-rumored resignation of Postmaster General Farley was announced by President Roosevelt today, saying that it would not be submitted until the Democratic National Convention closed. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem. A key person of the Arab National Supreme Committee recently told the press that the situation is deteriorating. "If the government's policy does not substantially meet the various demands of the Arabs (i.e., prohibiting Jewish immigration to Palestine), then the strike and market strike movement will continue."

<p>(London) Reuters news, London officialdom I believe that there is a conflict between British and Soviet opinions in the Mondreau conference.

<h3>英政界之暗鬥　鮑爾溫與倫敦德里有意見</h3>
<p>(London) After the general election in the House of Commons last year, the cabinet was reorganized. Former Secretary of Aviation, Lord Londonderry, was removed from office and replaced by Lord Swinton. At that time, Prime Minister Baldwin once declared that the report he received regarding the expansion of the German Air Force was not entirely accurate, implying that he blamed Lord Londonderry. Lord Londonderry gave a speech at a meeting in Newcastle this afternoon, publicly denying what the Prime Minister said last year, saying, "I have never blinded the Prime Minister. It is surprising that he made this statement. During my tenure as Secretary of Aviation, I reported to the Prime Minister at any time on the plans and steps taken by Germany to expand its air force. This information was obtained by responsible personnel. I can notify all cabinet members of the true situation. Although the numbers obtained are accurate, they are not far from the truth. I have not seen any reason to correct them. Moreover, Germany loves peace, and its sincerity of will is no less than that of Britain. We should treat the peace proposal put forward by German Führer Hitler on March 31 with magnanimity and sincerity. It should be known that the world's peace cause depends on the coordination of Britain, France, and Germany." (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Former Secretary of Aviation, Lord Londonderry, who was accused by Prime Minister Baldwin last year of concealing the truth about the expansion of the German Air Force, once spoke in Newcastle yesterday to defend himself. He recently gave a speech to the press here, saying, "We are intent on enriching the country's financial resources, and we cannot continue to implement the national defense plan. As a result, the strength of the army, navy, and air force has been greatly weakened. Our country is facing many difficulties today. The reason is nothing more than this. Now that we have decided on a major plan to reorganize the military, we should catch up and move forward. This is what I firmly believe." (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) After former Secretary of Aviation, Lord Londonderry, gave a speech in Newcastle yesterday, defending himself and attacking Prime Minister Baldwin's remarks last year, people in the political circles were shocked, thinking that when the House of Commons meets next time, some members may raise questions to the government about the facts revealed by Lord Londonderry. At that time, Prime Minister Baldwin will also take the opportunity to defend himself. According to the rumors that the Prime Minister was about to be forced to resign last month, he gave a speech in Cambridge at that time, expressing his attitude, saying, "If I have a breath, I will never end my political career. I hope to be judged after I die, and I can use the famous sentence of the great poet Tennyson as my epitaph. I am content with that. The famous sentence is 'Silent and reserved, that is his strength; he turns a deaf ear to the words of others.'" The general public believes that the Prime Minister's speech was aimed at Lord Londonderry. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>National Assembly Elections: Men and Women are Equally Eligible</h3>

<h3>Artistic Musings: "No Picking"</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Now is precisely what is known as the "season of green shade." There is no better time than now to travel through the mountains and waters, enjoying nature. In the countryside fields, it is as if a green dye vat has been overturned, with heaps upon heaps of green everywhere. In urban parks, the green arrangements are even more orderly: the trees are like green pagodas, the junipers are like low green walls, and the lawns are like green carpets. Those who love innocence do not like these artificial forms of nature, finding them contrived and affected; they do not like these orderly arrangements, finding them stiff. Indeed, it is difficult for them to avoid this criticism. This is originally a Western-style garden decoration method. Westerners' lives are scientific in everything, even forcing the flowers and plants of the natural world to take on geometric shapes. This aesthetic does not align with the Easterners' longstanding love of innocence and nature. We occasionally see plants in these geometric shapes and find them novel and pleasing for a time. However, after seeing them often, or comparing them with wild plants, we find them very unnatural. If poets and painters, with "emotionalized" eyes, were to visit these parks, what would be presented before them would be like a group of people with broken backs, severed heads, and amputated limbs, in a state too dreadful to bear. For them, entering the park would not only fail to bring entertainment but would instead cause a feeling of displeasure.</p>
<p>This feeling of displeasure is originally unique to sensitive people, and ordinary people need not share it. But in most parks today, there is another more obvious phenomenon that often gives visitors an unpleasant impression. These are the signs such as "No Picking." According to a friend, he walked through the park gate with a very happy mood. Every time he saw a "No" sign, his happiness would drop by 10%. After seeing several "No" signs, his happiness would only be 18%. I can understand his mood very well. The reason why he felt unhappy after seeing these "No" signs was not because he wanted to pick flowers and break willows, and was prevented from fulfilling his wishes because of the prohibition. Nor was it because he had picked flowers and broken willows and had been slapped in the face by others. What he hated was that these severe signs destroyed the beauty of the park and harmed the peace of people's hearts.</p>
<p>I completely sympathize with this idea. We do not deny the existence of the words "No," but we hate that they should not be used in parks. For example, in important military and political areas, there is a fiery sign outside saying "No Trespassing," and we do not dislike it. Because these places are inherently unlovable, we never want to get a good impression in these places. Even if there are two machine guns placed at the door, it is up to them, let alone just marking a few words? Another example is the customs office, where there is a fiery sign outside saying "No Circumvention," and we do not dislike it either. Because customs must be handled strictly, we never hope that they will sit idly by and watch smuggling happen politely. Even sending soldiers and police to guard is not excessive, let alone posting a note. Another example is on the platform of a railway station, where there is a sign saying "No Trespassing on the Tracks"; on a bottle of iodine, there is a red word saying "Not for Internal Use." We not only do not dislike them, but we are grateful. Because they prevent people from accidentally touching danger, harming lives. These warnings are out of good intentions. Therefore, the word "No" is very suitable in the above-mentioned places, and we do not feel unhappy: but when placed in the park, it is very disharmonious and sometimes stings the eyes of visitors. Because the park is a place for people to play and a place to get comfort. Everything in it is beauty and peace. Taking the two severe words "No" and placing them in the background of beauty and peace is like a little red among all the green, which is quite glaring; it is also like a gangster with a pistol mixed in among many beloved guests, which is quite disharmonious!</p>
<p>Just imagine: on a bathing day morning, or in the evening after work, with two or three companions strolling in the park, for people living a tense modern city life, this is a good opportunity to restore the spirit, encourage vitality, regulate life, and enjoy the fun of life. But as soon as you walk in the door, you are given a warning head-on: "No Picking!" The tourist has no intention of picking flowers or breaking branches in his heart. But after eating this warning, there is inevitably a burst of tension in the heart, and the hands seem to feel a little spasm. He warns himself to be careful not to violate the rule. When you encounter a lovely tree, you would rather stay a little farther away to avoid suspicion. After walking for a while, you see a pond with fish swimming back and forth. There are no trees or flowers here. Tourists think they can relax and enjoy the fun of the fish here. However, looking over the railing, you are given another warning in the face: "No Fishing and Throwing..." The tourist originally did not want to fish, nor did he want to throw things into the pond. But after eating this warning, there is another burst of tension in the heart, and the hands feel another kind of spasm. Again, he warns himself to be careful not to violate the rules. The body leans on the railing, and it is better to put your hands behind your back to avoid suspicion. After looking at the pool, it is better to leave earlier, because it is very unsettling to appreciate the joy of the fish in this way. After walking for a while, you see a piece of grassland, flat, wide and neat, really like a large piece of green lacquered floor. A small path in the center, winding and twisting, is like a white silk lying on this floor. This is such a sight that attracts tourists, and everyone is happy to take a walk on this path. But as soon as you step in, you are immediately given a warning: "No Walking on the Grass." The tourist originally could not bear to trample on these green velvet-like tender grass. But after eating this warning, there is another burst of tension in the heart, and the feet also feel a kind of spasm. Again, he warns himself to be careful not to violate the rules. He originally wanted to stand in the center of the path for a while, looking at the green grass around, imagining himself wearing the floating shoes in the myth, standing on the duckweed. But this has the suspicion of violating the prohibition. It is better to quickly pass through this path to be more at ease. After walking for a while, you see an animal garden: after walking for a while, you see a swing; after walking for a while, you see a greenhouse; but there are warnings to eat everywhere. Even sitting idly on a long chair, you have to eat a warning of "Do Not Move the Chairs." Tourists originally came to seek comfort, but now they have turned into entering the park to eat warnings! Hanging many "No" signs in the park for people to play in is like wearing many fleas and lice on your skin-tight shirt, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. The beauty of the flowers, trees, fish ponds, and lawns is greatly reduced by these severe warnings. These are really "spoiling the scenery" things.</p>

<h3>Gangsters Expand Smuggling Activities; Two Disturbances Occur; Southbound Jinpu Train Damaged; Dairong Maru Refuses Inspection, Japan Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Since the establishment of the "Free Trade Association" by Japanese gangsters and the formation of smuggling groups, their desperate smuggling efforts have intensified compared to before. Transporting smuggled goods southward from Tianjin has become a routine occurrence every night, and people in customs and the general public do not find it strange. However, the disputes that arose on the 25th due to the train being damaged cannot be ignored. On the 25th, the 305th express train from Ping arrived in Tianjin and stopped at the East Station. Dozens of Japanese gangsters from the Trade Association, protecting coolies, forcefully loaded 684 pieces of goods, including sugar, rayon, cigarette paper, and cotton cloth, weighing over 1,700 tons in total, onto the 1053rd second-class carriage and the 1114th, 1122nd, and 1137th third-class carriages. All four carriages were filled with goods, and the passengers were expelled and disembarked. When it was time to depart, the train mechanics inspected and found that the spring of the 1053rd second-class carriage was bent due to excessive load, making it impossible to proceed. The carriage was then detached. The gangsters initially protested, but the railway staff explained the danger, and they eventually relented. The train finally departed at 12 o'clock. Upon arriving at the main station, the technicians from the locomotive department further discovered that the three third-class carriages carrying goods were also overloaded, posing a significant risk. They negotiated with the gangsters to unload some of the goods to prevent accidents en route. The gangsters were already dissatisfied because the second-class carriage had been detached, and the goods could not be transported southward. Now, seeing that the third-class carriages were also about to be detached, they strongly disagreed. A dispute arose at that time. Subsequently, the Jinpu Railway Office in Tianjin dispatched personnel to invite Japanese military police to mediate. The gangsters then agreed to detach the three carriages carrying goods, which departed the following day. Due to the negotiations, the 305th express train was delayed for more than two hours, finally departing at 1:30 AM on the 26th. Up to 294 passengers who had already purchased tickets from Pingjin were expelled from the train and unable to travel with it. Some passengers had to take the Jinpu slow train departing south at 9 AM on the 26th and spent the night at the station.</p>
<p>Last week, the Tianjin Customs intercepted the Japanese smuggling ship "Dairong Maru" while suppressing smuggling in Qikou, resulting in a serious dispute that remains unresolved. The incident occurred on June 20th, when the Japanese ship "Dairong Maru," carrying smuggled goods, sailed from Dalian towards Qikou under the command of Captain Sakata and a crew of four Japanese and two Chinese. Three nautical miles from the shore, it was spotted by a Tianjin Customs anti-smuggling gunboat. The gunboat pursued the "Dairong Maru," which, seeing no escape, suddenly opened fire to resist. The gunboat was forced to return fire. After a fierce exchange, the hull of the "Dairong Maru" was damaged, rendering it unable to sail. Captain Sakata and seaman Okanaga sustained minor injuries to their backs and legs. The gunboat towed the ship to Tanggu. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Consulate-General in Tianjin immediately instructed the Tanggu Police Branch Chief Yamagata to investigate. On the 21st, Japanese Vice-Consul Nagai, acting on instructions from Consul-General Tajiri, specifically visited Xu Liya, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, to declare a reservation regarding the incident. On the same day, numerous Japanese gangsters from the Tianjin Japanese Trade Association went to the Tanggu Customs sub-office to cause trouble. Customs officer Akatani, along with the police, persuaded them to leave. At 1:00 PM on the 24th, Tajiri again sent Consul Kishi Ichi to meet with Xu Liya at Tianjin Customs to lodge a verbal protest, alleging that the Customs' actions were illegal, that the "Dairong Maru" had a gross tonnage of only eight tons, was not carrying smuggled goods, and had not approached the Chinese coast. It was alleged that the Customs had suddenly opened fire on an undefended merchant ship, causing damage to the hull from 220 bullets and eight bullet holes in the Japanese flag hoisted on the bow, constituting a provocation and insult to Japan. Xu Liya replied that the incident was due to a misunderstanding and that the Customs patrol ship would not have opened fire had the "Dairong Maru" not resisted. After obtaining the facts about the Customs opening fire, Consul Kishi left. At 3:30 PM on the same day, Japanese naval attaché Kubota also visited Xu Liya. In addition to raising the same questions, he stated that the Customs patrol ship had acted like a pirate ship, infringing on Japanese maritime rights. On April 10th, the commander of the Lushun Fortress had issued a statement to the Customs regarding anti-smuggling in Xiamen, and this should not have happened again. He further stated that the Japanese Navy, to protect the safety of Japanese maritime navigation and monitor the actions of Customs patrol ships, would, if necessary, dispatch warships from Lushun to patrol the coast and take decisive action in case of incidents. On the 25th, Kubota also issued a statement on the incident, criticizing the handling of the "Dairong Maru" case as inappropriate, using strong and unreasonable language. That afternoon, Xu Liya specifically visited Tajiri and Kubota to explain the misunderstanding and promised to respond to the Japanese side after receiving instructions from the Chief Commissioner of Customs in Shanghai. By the evening, the Japanese side's attitude had eased somewhat. If the Customs handles this matter properly, it may not escalate. (June 26th)</p>
<h3>Banditry in Eastern Hubei Remains Rampant; Gao's Bandits Flee to Shaanxi; Macheng Residents Petition to Suppress Bandits, Stating Their Force Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The remnants of Gao Junting's bandit army of the 25th Army have been roaming the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui for the longest time. The counties of Eastern Hubei have suffered the most severely. At the beginning of this month, due to being unable to withstand the encirclement and suppression by government troops, the bandits requested strategic instructions from the pseudo-central government in Shaanxi. The pseudo-central government ordered that if they could not sustain themselves in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, they should lead the Red Army to Shaanxi, and Shaanxi would send Red Army troops to meet them. After receiving the order, Gao's bandits changed their plan, crossed the Pinghan Railway westward, and reached the Pinglin Temple area at the junction of Sui County, Yingshan County, and Anlu County in northern Hubei. They entrenched themselves there for several days, planning to continue north and directly enter southern Shaanxi. However, the national army in northern Hubei was heavily defended, and they were unable to succeed. Recently, it was reported that they had returned to Lishan in eastern Hubei. Their intentions are currently unknown. Nearby counties, such as Qianshan and Taihu in Anhui, Yingshan, Xishui, Luotian, Huanggang Daqishan, Huangbo Shan, and Macheng in Hubei, and Yujiahe on the border of Jingfu in Henan, extending to Xinyang and across the railway to Tongbai, still have plainclothes squads appearing, attempting to launch surprise attacks. Their ambush methods and engagements with the national army demonstrate a trend of spreading and becoming difficult to eliminate. Residents of Macheng, due to the resurgence of banditry, have specially sent representatives to petition the authorities. Their petition describes the bandit situation in great detail. The content is as follows: "Upon investigation, Gao Junting's bandit force, composed of the elite, numbers only about a thousand. They gather and disperse intermittently in the counties of the border area. Since June 18th of last year, when they entered Muzidian in eastern Macheng via Jingfu and killed our Baojia chief Yang Yuezhai and five others, a year has passed. In this year, they have ravaged more than 50 villages in the southeast of the county, killing over 300 Baojia chiefs and local gentry. The government has received numerous reports, which can be statistically verified. In the past, the bandits' incursions into the county were of a guerrilla nature. Recently, seeing that the local area has no real resistance, they have chosen to establish Soviet areas for long-term occupation. To the east, they use the Leifeng Mountain, Xima River, Hujia Mountain, and Baisha Ridge, located to the left and right of the Guifeng Mountain range, as their base. To the south, they use the Daqi Mountain, which belongs to Huanggang, and the Linjia Mountain, Qiligang, Meihuayuan, Dingjia Mountain, etc., which connect to Guifeng, as their base. On May 29th, the bandits split their forces from Daqi Mountain and crossed the Wenma Highway between Li Ji, Xin Ji, and Pantang in Huanggang, passing through Qiting and Songbu to Zhongguan Station and entered the west of the county, using Yangjia Gaoshan as their base. To the northwest is Huang'an Jingfu, and to the southeast is the old Ninth District of the county. The Hanma, Majie, and Zhongzhong motor roads all crisscross the area. With this mountain in the bandits' possession, Guifeng to the northeast and Daqi Mountain to the southeast form a tripod, overlooking the county seat, Qisongzhong Station, and Yanjiahe, all of which are within their sight. Since the bandits have dispersed into smaller units, when the infantry pursues forward, the bandits suddenly appear behind them. Therefore, the army passes through, considering the area to be free of bandits. Now, within the county, the bandits are openly and brazenly organized in all the villages. The bandit areas are expanding daily, becoming difficult to eliminate. It is also reported that neighboring counties such as Huanggang, Huangpi, Lishan, Huang'an, Shangcheng, and Lihuang all have some areas similar to Macheng. While the local militia can watch and help each other, their knives, spears, and bird guns are no match for the bandits' sophisticated weapons. Talking about raising funds to purchase weapons is not only too difficult but almost a violation of the law. Therefore, the local gentry and people with deeper reputations can act but dare not, while those with shallower reputations dare to act, but no one trusts them. In this desperate situation, with no way to seek help, we beseech Your Honor, as local officials, to have a responsibility to protect the people and the land. If there is a feasible solution, we implore you to implement it immediately. Otherwise, you must truthfully report the situation to seek relief for the people. If there are too many concerns, then we will hold firm to our determination to live or die with the city, but we will inevitably be suspected of concealing bandits and failing to report them. The entire district and county, with the security of property and lives at stake, cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to disregard taboos and risk our lives to make this statement. If there is any falsehood, we are willing to accept punishment. Macheng County Refugee Representatives and 500,000 Refugees Prostrate Themselves and Implore." (June 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Purchase Anhui Wheat; Qingdao Gang Led by a Korean Mr. Han Collects and Purchases in Large Quantities, Transporting Everything to North China</h3>
<p>Wuhu dispatch: In Anhui Province's agricultural products, wheat occupies a significant proportion of miscellaneous grains. In southern Anhui, besides the only Fuxing Flour Mill in Wuhu, which annually receives over 100,000 piculs, the surplus after farmers' own consumption is mostly shipped to Beijing and Shanghai. In years of good harvest, exports reach hundreds of thousands of piculs. This year's harvest is excellent, with produce continuously concentrating in Wuhu from various places. However, due to sluggish market prices in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, Tianjin and other gangs have mostly suspended operations and are waiting to see. Unexpectedly, in this standoff between buyers and sellers, the Qingdao gang, under the names of Feng Shuncheng and others, regardless of the price of wheat, is boldly purchasing in large quantities. Yesterday, they already shipped out over 5,000 bags on Japanese ships and are still absorbing it without restriction, stockpiling it in warehouses to be transported to North China in batches by ironclad ships. As a result, sales have suddenly become active, and market prices have also stabilized. Zhegao wheat is currently selling for 5.82 to 5.68 yuan, while the average price is around 5.50 yuan. It has been noted that Japanese merchants in Anhui have always focused on purchasing rapeseed, rapeseed cake, and peas, but this time, the Qingdao gang has suddenly absorbed a large quantity of wheat. Upon investigation, it was confirmed that it was purchased by Japanese merchants, with a Japanese person named Tanaka presiding over the operation in Wuhu. The Qingdao gang's Mr. Han is collecting the wheat in order to conceal the involvement of the Japanese. The sudden demand from Japanese merchants is rumored to be because several flour mills in North China are now managed by Japanese, resulting in a shortage of raw materials. This is truly something to pay attention to. (June 26th)</p>
<h3>Each County in Gansu Province to Implement Reorganization by Converting Bureaus to Sections; Provincial Government Establishes County Administrative Personnel Training Institute to Improve Internal Structure of Each County Government</h3>
<p>Lanzhou dispatch: The Gansu Provincial County Administrative Personnel Training Institute has been established and commenced classes on the 15th of this month. According to a conversation with Director Liu of the Department of Civil Affairs, the purpose of training county administrative personnel is to improve the internal organization of each county government. He mentioned that the province's plan to reorganize each county's government by converting bureaus to sections and increasing county administrative funding had already been approved by the provincial council and was scheduled to be implemented from July 1st of this year. The only remaining issue is how to improve the internal organization of each county government, and the County Administrative Personnel Training Institute has been established for this purpose. The institute's training is temporarily divided into four phases. The first phase trains the chiefs of the third section of the county government, the second phase trains the chiefs of the first section, and the third and fourth phases train district chiefs. Each phase is scheduled for six weeks. The training curriculum for each phase aims to meet the needs of the trainees and emphasizes the review of actual issues in the province. All trainees in each phase are required to be current employees of each county and will also recruit individuals interested in engaging in county administration to select talented individuals. All trainees must pass an entrance examination. The first phase of training, limited to local construction personnel, took place on the 10th of this month, with classes commencing on the 15th. In addition to the directors of the education bureau or chiefs of the third section who have already been recommended by each county, many individuals have voluntarily applied from outside. According to the training institute's regulations, all graduates will be assigned to positions and will be guaranteed job security, not subject to removal based on the county magistrate's departure. It is clearly stipulated that after assuming office, county magistrates cannot arbitrarily transfer or dismiss them unless there is significant misconduct that has been approved for disciplinary action. Furthermore, promotions will be based on merit, allowing people to settle into their positions, regularizing government affairs, alleviating the people's difficulties, and allowing county administration to improve day by day.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Fiscal Deficit for This Year Exceeds 3 Million; Various Government Agencies Owe Three Months of Administrative Expenses; Raising 1 Million to Struggle Through Difficulties</h3>
<p>Hangzhou dispatch: Zhejiang Province's finances, since the abolition of transit duties in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], have experienced a sudden shortfall in revenue from various taxes. Coupled with the bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, the people are unable to bear the burden of various taxes. Furthermore, drought and bandit disasters have occurred one after another, resulting in a sharp decline in provincial revenue, leading to insufficient income and financial straits. Borrowing money to make up for the deficit has become common, resulting in a high debt and increasingly difficult financial turnover. The budget for the 24th year of the Republic [1935] had a total revenue and expenditure of over 21 million yuan, with over 3 million yuan of the revenue being fictitious. Now that the 24th year is coming to an end and the 25th year [1936] is about to begin, the financial situation is even more difficult. Upon investigation, the total revenue for the 24th year is estimated to be no more than 18 million yuan, while the expenditure, with the addition of temporary expenses, amounts to over 21.5 million yuan. The deficit between revenue and expenditure is estimated to be over 3.5 million yuan. As of this month, various government agencies are three months behind on their administrative expenses. With the summer vacation for provincial schools approaching, a portion of the educational funding must be allocated. It is reported that the Department of Finance has decided to allocate one month of administrative expenses, totaling 600,000 yuan, and over 300,000 yuan in special educational funds at the end of this month. Therefore, it is necessary to raise 1 million yuan to overcome this difficult situation. The Department of Finance's major borrowing of 4 million yuan from banks in Shanghai and Hangzhou has been finalized and is scheduled to be signed in early July. It is possible that 1 million yuan will be drawn in advance at the end of this month to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Another Anti-Rent Tide Rises in the Suzhou Countryside</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 16th, in a village seven miles from Weijingtang outside Qimen in Suzhou, soldiers from a detachment of the first company of the seventh battalion of the garrison security force went to urge the villagers to promptly pay their overdue land rent from last year. The villagers refused and gathered to clash with the security force. They first severely struck the head of the detachment soldier, knocking him unconscious on the spot. As the other soldiers were about to arrest the villagers who committed the assault, the villagers attempted to seize the security force's weapons. The security force then opened fire, and the villagers responded by firing homemade guns at the security force, resulting in a serious confrontation. As a result, one security force soldier went missing along with his gun, and six or seven people were wounded. One villager was killed by the security force. On the morning of the 27th, the security force headquarters, upon receiving the report, immediately sent a detachment led by battalion commander Nie Dezhao to the town to suppress the situation and investigate the truth, while also reporting to the court to send personnel to examine the body.</p>
<p>Last year, many villages in Suzhou owed rent, which was mostly withheld, resulting in several minor disturbances that did not escalate. For the convenience of collecting rent, the county government specially sent commissioners to establish rent collection stations in each district. At 3:00 PM on the 27th, County Government Commissioner Feng Runsen sent over one hundred soldiers from a detachment of a company of the security force to collect rent in Xuejing Township, Yanshang, Weijingtang. At that time, Gu Zian, a resident of Weijingtang, was working in the field. Because Gu owed land rent on his three mu of farmland, the security force arrested him. Upon seeing this, the villagers shouted and gathered dozens of people, who knocked down rent collector Chen Mingshan and beat and kicked him. Meanwhile, the soldiers had already taken Gu Zian to the station. Another villager named Xu Ruiyun and village chief Xu Jie Lin went to the station to plead for Gu's release but were also detained. Soon after, a large group of about 300 villagers, carrying homemade guns, hoes, and other tools, went to the station to snatch the prisoners, taking Gu and the others to the Louzitou teahouse. The security force pursued them, and a major clash erupted between the two sides, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides. Three villagers died. Gu Zian was shot four times and died on the spot. Xu Ruiyun was shot in the lower abdomen and died. Yuan Honggao was seriously injured and died en route to the hospital in Suzhou. Eight people were injured, including Xu Jishan's wife, who was a woman. Xu Boqian was shot in the lower abdomen, and the bullet did not exit, his life is in danger. Xu Chunquan's life is in danger. The remaining six people, Xu Xiaogen, Xu Tingyun, Xu Fushan, Gu Fengchun, Xu Mingqi, and Xu Jishan's wife, sustained minor injuries. On the security force's side, four people were seriously injured, two were slightly injured, and one went missing. The injured were left in the village. The security battalion headquarters has sent Deputy Officer Chang with a medical officer to the village to treat the wounded.

<h3>Investigating the Case of Selling Stolen Coal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association, due to the Ni Songji Coal Company outside Pingmen in Suzhou selling 300 tons of stolen coal from Liujiang, depreciated the coal and offered it for sale, sent a letter to the Wu County Coal Association for verification and reply. Ye Jin Xiong, Chairman of the Wu County Coal Industry Association, acted upon receipt of the letter and immediately forwarded it to Ni Songji Coal Company owner Ni Songjun, requesting a concrete reply. Unexpectedly, a reply has not yet been received. Furthermore, it was discovered that Yu Shuxiang, a dentist on Damalu outside Qimen, organized the Su Xing Hebei White Coal Sales Company, selling white coal from Hebei to Wu County and Kunshan County. After the dispute over the stolen coal from Liujiang escalated, he removed the company's signboard. He has frequently reported the above situation to the Shanghai Coal Industry Association. However, the Wu County Party Headquarters suddenly received a report stating that members of the Coal Industry Association were selling stolen coal from Liujiang. The County Special Commissioner specially invited He Hefang, representative of the Coal Industry Association, and Yu Xue Zhang, who previously sold white coal from Liujiang, for a conversation at 3:00 PM on the 27th, inquiring about everything and instructing them to investigate thoroughly to clarify the truth. Meanwhile, the County Special Commissioner secretly investigated to provide a basis for handling the case. The Chairman of the Coal Industry Association, Ye Jin Xiong, suddenly resigned yesterday. It is rumored that this matter is also related.</p>

<p>工業漸臻好轉</p>
<p>Industry Gradually Improves</p>
<p>出口成本足與外商力敵</p>
<p>Export Costs Can Compete with Foreign Businesses</p>
<p>華東社雲，本市工業，經數度奮門積極改進後，已漸臻好轉，最原著者，爲成本已逐漸減低，出口足以與外商力敵，回憶去年今日，正在工業界焦頭爛額時期，故工業界認現時之中國工業，可呈樂觀，據工商界潘仰堯談，各業在本年六個月來，一切均較去年同時期爲好，其原因爲注意成本，推廣銷路，故絲綢、茶葉、電機、化學、棉織、面粉、綢緞、橡膠、藥業，諸項工商業，均較往年獲利，籌碼頗稱松動，前途甚爲樂觀，又據金融界傳說消息，現在各銀行各錢莊對于工業放款，亦較去年爲寬，其利息只九厘至一分，較往時亦低，現且有一部分銀行界，疑以集體方式投資，最短一月內，可有具體辦法。</p>
<p>According to the "East China News Agency," after several efforts and active improvements, the city's industry has gradually improved. The most fundamental reason is that costs have gradually decreased, and exports can compete with foreign businesses. Recalling this time last year, it was a time when the industrial sector was in a state of utter chaos. Therefore, the industrial sector believes that the current state of Chinese industry is optimistic. According to Pan Yangyao from the business community, all industries have been better in the past six months of this year than during the same period last year. The reasons are that they have paid attention to costs and expanded sales channels. As a result, silk, tea, electrical machinery, chemicals, cotton textiles, flour, silk fabrics, rubber, and pharmaceuticals have all been more profitable than in previous years, and the financial situation has become more relaxed. The future is very optimistic. According to rumors from financial circles, banks and money shops are now more lenient in lending to industry than they were last year, with interest rates only between 0.9% and 1%, which is lower than in the past. There is even a part of the banking sector that is considering investing collectively, and there may be concrete measures within a month at the earliest.</p>

<p>According to the "New Sound News Agency," the Japanese ships Daiei Maru and Moei Maru were intercepted by Tianjin Customs for carrying smuggled goods and fired shots to refuse inspection, causing trouble. Tajiri, the acting Japanese Consul General stationed in Tianjin, protested to our customs authorities. Now, Tajiri came to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane the afternoon before yesterday to discuss the negotiation strategy with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe. He arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 p.m. that night and went to the residence of the Japanese Ambassador on Pique Road to meet Kawagoe. Kawagoe also hosted a banquet, during which everything was discussed in detail before dispersing late at night. Yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m., he visited again to continue the discussion. It has been decided that he will return to Tianjin within today or tomorrow. As for the news that a Japanese telegram instructed Kawagoe to lodge a serious protest with our government, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy declared yesterday afternoon that the embassy had not yet received any instructions regarding this matter.</p>
<p>滬西　發現血吸蟲病</p>
<p>Schistosomiasis Discovered in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>池浜遊泳切宜注意　犬類亦勿縱令入水</p>
<p>Exercise Caution When Swimming in Ponds; Do Not Allow Dogs to Enter the Water</p>
<p>工部局衛生處發表消息，本埠西郊一帶，現發生一種血吸蟲病，受傳染者，人與犬最多，據雲，此類病因系因河浜之中，螺蛳田螺之屬，首受傳染，人畜夏令遊泳于池浜中，病蟲即由皮膚侵入體內，受染之後，人類即日漸黃萎衰弱，最近雷士德醫學研究院，對于此症之現象，極爲注意，該院病理科學組主任羅伯荪博士，複從螺蛳田螺之屬，加以廣泛之研究，其結果雖尚未有受傳染之螺蛳田螺發現，但該病之來源，確已證明在虹橋河浜，羅別根路，虹橋高爾夫球場，以及白利南路，蘇州河一帶，而真如尤爲此病發現之中心，該處螺蛳類一千枚之中，受傳染者有十五枚之多，蘇州河本身及其他有潮汐之河流，雖未必即屬危險，但聖約翰大學附近之小河，確已受有傳染，故滬西一帶居民，切勿入河浜中沐浴，犬類尤應加以注意，勿使入水，蓋此症輕者面色黃萎，身體衰弱，現貧血之狀，而重者病蟲侵入肝髒，因而成爲膨脹之病，頗足致人于死雲。</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department announced that a type of schistosomiasis is now occurring in the western suburbs of this city. Humans and dogs are the most frequently infected. According to reports, this type of disease is caused by snails in the rivers and ponds that are first infected. When people and animals swim in the ponds in the summer, the parasites enter the body through the skin. After being infected, humans gradually become jaundiced, weak, and debilitated. Recently, the Lester Institute of Medical Research has paid close attention to the phenomenon of this disease. Dr. Robertson, the director of the pathology science group of the institute, has also conducted extensive research on snails. Although no infected snails have been found as a result, the source of the disease has been confirmed to be in the Hongqiao River, Lubogen Road, Hongqiao Golf Course, and Bailinan Road, Suzhou River area, with Zhenru being the center of the disease. Among 1,000 snails in that area, 15 were infected. The Suzhou River itself and other tidal rivers may not necessarily be dangerous, but the small river near St. John's University has been infected. Therefore, residents in the western Shanghai area should not bathe in the rivers and ponds, and dogs should be especially careful not to let them enter the water, because the disease can cause jaundice, weakness, and anemia in mild cases, and in severe cases, the parasites can invade the liver, causing swelling and death.</p>

<h3>One Japanese Person Travels in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Two Japanese youths, Ooba Chiko and Ooga Kou, both 22 years old, graduated from the Shanghai Toa Dobun Shoin (East Asia Common Culture Academy) this spring in March. The entire class of 63 students organized travel groups to various provinces and departed in groups. Three people went to Anhui Province. One of them, Yamauchi Minoru, stayed in Shanghai due to illness. Ooba and Ooga traveled from southern Anhui through central Anhui to Bengbu. Subsequently, they traveled from Bengbu to Yingshang, Fuyang, and Hao County in northern Anhui.</p>
<p>The entire line of the Jiaxing to Suzhou railway, the Sujia Railway, is now fully constructed. The platforms at each station along the line have also been completed. Passenger ticket prices and operational plans have also been finalized and approved by the Ministry of Railways. The station chiefs for each station have also been appointed by the Railway Bureau. The station chiefs for Jiaxing and Wuxian stations will be concurrently managed by the original station chiefs. The station chiefs for the other stations are Wang Jiangjing, Yin Shouhua; Shengze, Bao Chengzou; Pingwang, Fang Longzhang; Bei , Hu Ruizhang; Wujiang, Hu Shili; and Fengmen, Lu Shichang. The official opening date is set for July 1.</p>
<p>The Jiaxing authorities are quite strict in terms of drug prohibition. They have repeatedly arrested and detained private sellers and peddlers, and all have been sentenced to prison terms separately. After Shen Jianfei, the leader of the anti-narcotics team in Gefei County, received a tip-off, he led detectives Chen Zixiang, Che Jiayin, and others to a thatched house at No. 55 Huangjiafang outside of Dongdou, where they arrested Zhan Asan, who specialized in peddling opium on the streets. After he confessed the location of the opium supply, they searched Chen Dexian's house in Tanhua Bay, Nanyan, and found over nine catties of opium and over one hundred yuan in cash. However, Chen Dexian escaped through the back door, and his wife, Lu, was arrested. She has now been handed over by the county government to the regional headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Xinmin Theater Causes Trouble Again</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Xinmin Theater in Beisi has seen no fewer than ten fights due to disagreements. Yesterday, someone initiated a Beijing opera performance. A man named Xu Zihe was collecting tickets inside when he suddenly had a conflict with a patron. Both sides had helpers, and they started fighting. Women and children fled in panic. At that time, a soldier was watching the play and was also affected by Xu and others. The soldiers were dissatisfied and reported to their superiors, who summoned Xu Zihe for questioning. This morning, four soldiers went to Xu's house, tied him up, and dragged him away. He has not been released by noon. Xu has repeatedly committed crimes and been sentenced to prison. Several years ago, he killed an apprentice. Later, he killed his wife with a knife. He has been severely punished for both offenses. This time he was arrested and, it is said, beaten before surrendering due to being outnumbered.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Two Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The bandits Qian Asi, 36 years old, from Baoying, Jiangsu, and Zheng Bangying, 31 years old, from Henan, colluded with the fugitive Bao Juncheng on January 1, 1934, to rob the home of Luo Zhidong in Yixing and kidnapped his daughter-in-law, Luo Shi, and his grandson, Luo Zhaolin, and granddaughter-in-law, Luo Yan, a total of three people. Because the ransom was unsuccessful, Qian Asi, Bao Juncheng, and others threw Luo Zhaolin and Luo Yan into Huanglong Cave, causing their deaths. On February 21 of the same year, they kidnapped Xu, the wife of Chuan Youcai in Changxing. In September 1931, they kidnapped Zhou Junyi and others in Yixing and extorted large sums of money. Later, the detective team of the Wuxing District Headquarters successively arrested Qian Asi, Zheng Bangying, and two others and escorted them to the district headquarters for interrogation. After the headquarters summoned witnesses and cross-examined them, the facts were clear. They were sentenced to death according to law and submitted to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government for approval. Yesterday, at 3:30 PM on the 25th, the judge, Hu, signed for the extradition of the bandit criminals Qian Asi and Zheng Bangying to verify their identities and escorted them to the South Military Field for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Economic Cooperation Between Zhejiang and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>In order to implement economic cooperation and regulate production between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, a special product exhibition has already been jointly held. Recently, for the sake of further cooperation, the Zhejiang Construction Department has drafted an economic cooperation plan for the two provinces, which will be implemented separately.</p>
<p>1.  Establish an economic cooperation promotion association for the two provinces.</p>
<p>2.  Establish provincial banks in Hangzhou and Nanchang.</p>
<p>3.  Establish special product trading offices in each other's provinces.</p>
<p>4.  Jointly seek improvements in the sugar and paper industries.</p>
<p>5.  Move Zhejiang farmers to Jiangxi to cultivate wasteland.</p>
<h3>Embankment for Water Carrying Destroyed by Tide</h3>
<p>The No. 104 embankment for water carrying on the south bank of the Qiantang River was destroyed by the recent large tide. The Futou pier and the Xiaoshao Highway Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are in danger of being washed away. This matter is of great importance to the safety of travelers. The Construction Department has specially dispatched Zhou Zhenlun, the director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, to cross the river for inspection. He plans to add another No. 103 embankment to resist the water force. The cost of 40,000 yuan will be submitted to the provincial government for approval to start construction.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Locust Nymphs Appear in the Fifth District</h3>
<p>Locust nymphs have appeared in the rapeseed fields of the fourth district of this county. The county magistrate and district office are supervising the bailiffs and civilians to eliminate them within a limited time. Now, locust nymphs have also appeared in the grass marshes of Zhoudian Lake and Xie villages in the fifth district, in considerable numbers. Fang Qingzhen, the chief of Zhoudian Village, has reported to the district and forwarded the report to the county, requesting the appointment of locust control directors to be responsible for eliminating them in sections. After receiving the report, the county government stated that the locust control director system in this county has long been abolished. Now that the Baojia system has been established, the Baojia system should be used to collect civilians and strive to eliminate them. On the 20th, a special order was given to the district chief of the fifth district to quickly supervise the Baojia chiefs to collect civilians and eliminate them all within three days and report the results to prevent them from spreading and causing harm.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Shops in the Southern City Go on Strike</h3>
<p>On the 24th, shops in the Dayun Bridge area of Shaoxing's southern city went on strike because the police cracked down on shop assistants going shirtless, and there was an incident of assault. This aroused public anger among the merchants and residents in the area. From Guanchiao Bridge to Daqing Bridge, all shops closed their doors and went on strike. At the same time, lawless elements gathered a large number of people, making a lot of noise, and destroyed the entire Shezimiao Public Security Police Station. The Chenqu Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress the situation, and at the same time, persuaded the shops to open their doors and resume business.</p>

<h3>Niu Huaijin's Blindness: The Root Cause in 606?</h3>
<p>One-eyed becomes double blind. A Western doctor sues another Western doctor. Demands 15,700 yuan in compensation.</p>
<p>The Puqing Hospital at No. 730 Guangdong Road was originally founded by Zhang Puqing from Zhenjiang, specializing in treating venereal diseases. It has been open for many years. After Zhang passed away from illness, it was taken over by his son, Dr. Zhang Fengqi, and his brother, Zhang Fengshi. Recently, the Zhang brothers were sued by Niu Huaijin (40 years old), an Anhui native residing at No. 21 Sande Lane, Edward Road, through his lawyer, Yan Gu Ren, to the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing them of fraud, taking property, and causing injury through negligence, violating Articles 340 and 284 of the Criminal Code. In addition to requesting legal punishment, he also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering payment of loss fees, providing 15,700 yuan, and so on.</p>
<p>This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Tan Xinzhen in Criminal Hearing Room 8. Both defendants retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to appear in court for defense. The plaintiff, Niu Huaijin, testified that on the 25th day of the 11th lunar month last year, his right eye was swollen and painful, and his left eye had already lost its sight. Therefore, at about 1:00 PM, he went to the defendant's Puqing Hospital for treatment. The defendant, Zhang Fengshi, diagnosed it as a venereal disease and injected him with a shot of Salvarsan ("606") in his right arm, for which he paid three yuan. Unexpectedly, his eye pain worsened when he returned home, and he felt dizzy and his head was heavy. At 6:00 PM, he removed the medicated cloth and suddenly discovered that his eye had lost its sight. At 8:00 AM the next morning, he went to the hospital again, where Zhang Fengqi treated him, led him to a dark room, and lit a piece of paper, asking if he could see it. He replied that he could not see it. Fengqi then said that the eye disease was quite serious, but he could find a way. He applied the medicated cloth again and told him to go home. After several days, he still could not regain his sight. Later, he consulted famous ophthalmologists Fan Xiangshan, Lu Lanliang, and various places in Nanjing, but they all refused to treat him because he had already been injected with Salvarsan, and there was no way to recover. For half a year, he has spent countless amounts, but still cannot regain his sight. He found that the defendants were practicing medicine without registering with the Engineering Bureau, which is fraudulent. He used to be the manager of a new cloth factory in Zhabei, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan. Now that he is blind in both eyes, the business has been shut down, and his family of four, including his children, will become starving corpses. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit and requested the defendant to pay him 60 yuan per month for 20 years, which should be 14,400 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan for consolation money and 200 yuan for medical expenses.</p>
<p>Then, the defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, raised two opinions, saying that the plaintiff had a history of chronic syphilis. In April last year, he had already requested the defendant's hospital to inject him with Salvarsan once, which could be verified by the account book. Therefore, according to the article of negligent injury in his lawsuit, it is a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint. The statute of limitations has already expired, and this point should be noted. He then presented the account book to the court.</p>
<p>When questioned, Zhang Fengqi testified that the Puqing Hospital was founded by his father, Zhang Puqing. After graduating from Zhenjiang Middle School, he studied medicine with his father for five years. Later, he served as a medical officer in the Fourth Army of Sun Chuanfang's troops in the Allied Forces. In 1927, he arrived in Shanghai and took over the Puqing Hospital left by his father. He also joined the Western Medical Association and held a certificate (and presented the certificate to the court). He found that the plaintiff, Niu Huaijin, was also a Western doctor and had opened the Renhui Hospital across from the Central Hotel on Wuma Road, treating illnesses on behalf of others. He was friends with him, so he knew each other. In April last year, the plaintiff suffered from syphilis and asked him to inject him with Salvarsan once. Until November last year, he came for treatment again. After he diagnosed it as chronic syphilis, which had extended to swelling and pain in the eyes, he injected him with another shot of Salvarsan. It is true that syphilis can cause blindness.</p>
<p>The plaintiff admitted that he had suffered from syphilis and had asked the defendant to give him an injection in April last year. Judge Tan reviewed the testimony and, because the case still needed investigation, scheduled a further hearing for 11:00 AM on July 11th.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Investigates and Reports: Rivers to be Dredged in Fiscal Year 25</h3>
<p>The dredging of various rivers in Shanghai County in Fiscal Year 24 has been completed successively. Now, the county government takes investigating and collecting dredging fees as one of the central tasks of the county government in Fiscal Year 25. It is urgent to investigate and determine. Yesterday, a special order was issued to various districts to quickly find out which rivers within their boundaries should be dredged, and to assess their financial resources to see if they can be carried out within Fiscal Year 25. They are requested to fill in the report truthfully, so as to rely on the old plan. The items to be investigated include: 1. River name. 2. Length (kilometers). 3. River mouth width (meters). 4. Starting and ending points. 5. Original condition. 6. How to plan and proceed. 7. Funding arrangements.</p>
<h3>Difficulties with Postal Delivery in Various Courts</h3>
<p>Unable to implement universally by July 1</p>
<p>The National Judicial Conference decided that the Ministry of Justice should handle postal deliveries. It has already established terms with the Ministry of Communications and ordered all courts to implement them from July 1. The courts in this city have received orders. In the special zone, it is planned to use both old and new methods for the sake of convenience. The Nanshi District Court is still considering the matter because its jurisdiction is vast and the villages cannot be mailed. However, since delivery has a fixed procedure, postal delivery seems easy for the defendant to be cunning, and the income will be greatly reduced, and salaries must be increased daily. The national treasury is empty, and the date of implementation is actually still pending.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Opium Smokers to Exchange Licenses is Approaching: Public Security Bureau Intensifies Investigation</h3>
<p>Those who are unable to exchange their licenses are allowed to apply for civilian licenses.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau has only four days left for opium smokers to exchange their licenses. According to one-tenth of the total number of opium smokers registered for licenses in the first phase, new licenses have not yet been exchanged. The bureau chief, Cai, believes that the widespread exchange of opium smokers' licenses is crucial to the future of the prohibition policy. Therefore, he recently sent Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the bureau's first section, to personally lead all investigators to Laobeimen, Linping Road, police stations, the Caojiadu branch bureau, etc., to jointly investigate and exchange licenses for opium smokers with officers and police from various branch bureaus and stations. Every day, more than 100 people are found, and they are all ordered to complete the procedures for exchanging licenses immediately before being released. Those who previously held ordinary licenses and are now unable to exchange for new licenses, if the Public Security Bureau investigates and confirms that they are poor people, can also change to poor people's licenses to show reality. If they wait and see and do not exchange, their licenses will not be allowed after the deadline. If they are found, they will be charged with smoking opium without a license. It is hoped that opium smokers in this city who have not exchanged their licenses will hurry to exchange them automatically. Now the deadline is approaching. Opium smokers in this city should not wait and see and miss the opportunity and fall into the legal net.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Appears in Various Places: Flour Mills All Start Work</h3>
<p>New wheat price sells for four yuan per 100 catties. Flour market rises as merchants from various regions report shipments.</p>
<p>This year's spring-ripening wheat in various places has seen uneven harvests due to the unusual spring floods. Production in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Pingze in North China has increased by 20-30% compared to previous years. Production in coastal areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is also very good. However, production in plateau areas has decreased by 30-40% compared to previous years. The new wheat, both early and late varieties, has successively appeared on the market for sale. The market price is four yuan and three dimes for the top grade, four yuan for the middle grade, and three yuan and eight or nine dimes for the lower grade per 100 market catties.</p>
<p>Various factories start work. More than 20 flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hankou, and other places, including Fuxin, Maoxin, Zaofeng, and Shenda, had previously suspended operations due to the lack of domestic flour raw materials, high prices of foreign wheat, and sluggish lower-level markets. All workers were also sent back to their hometowns one after another. Now that the new wheat has successively appeared on the market, Shanghai Fuxin, Fufeng, Shenda, and Hankou Fuxin branches, Wuxi Maoxin one and two factories, and other flour mills along the Jinghu and Jinpu lines have all started production this week.</p>
<p>Flour Market Prospects. A Dagongbao reporter inquired with flour mills yesterday and said that the recent flour market situation is turning around. Stored flour is also gradually decreasing. Merchants from North China and Southeast Asia are also reporting shipments. Speculators inevitably manipulate and monopolize the market, which greatly affects the factories. If there are no military disturbances, there is reason for optimism. Economically, the factories will strive to tighten up.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to the Engineering Bureau: Reorganize the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Engineering Bureau yesterday, saying: "I am very strict. Our association received a letter from the Shanghai Human Resources Commercial Guild. The letter states that the Shanghai Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society is, in terms of its source of funds and nature, actually a mass organization of the Chinese Public Association. In order to ensure that the name matches reality, we propose to request the Engineering Bureau to reorganize it according to the following three principles: (A) The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society should be a social organization managed by impartial members of society. The Industrial and Commercial Bureau should return to its supervisory position, and current administrative personnel should not participate to avoid political influence. (B) The sole task of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society should be to handle the welfare of rickshaw pullers and should not be used to provoke class struggle or promote the destruction of the economic system. (C) The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society should not charge rickshaw pullers fees. Its funds should be raised from social donations. Rickshaw merchants are willing to bear monthly payments to show their sympathy to rickshaw pullers. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society is a labor organization that uses its own funds to promote its own welfare. In terms of its previous situation, it is the same in nature as a trade union of professional workers, which seeks the welfare of workers. Although the task of the Mutual Aid Society is not as broad as that of a trade union, its inherent nature drives it to be a social organization and should not be regarded as a branch of the municipal government. This point is undeniable. The three points of the principles that the trade union intends to change, and the request that your bureau participate in a supervisory position, are, in our opinion, sufficient reasons. We have successively sent letters to your bureau requesting support for this association and giving it consideration, and we deeply look forward to it.</p>
<h3>A Husband with Multiple Wives: Lawsuits Continue Unabated</h3>
<p>How did Xu Bozhang initially marry Pan? Pan Jingyu testifies in court about her suffering.</p>
<p>Xu Bozhang, a 40-year-old man from Fuzhou, has a wife, Wang Aiyu, 25 years old, in his hometown of Fuzhou, who lives in the countryside. Because Xu was doing business in Shanghai, he felt lonely. In September 1934, he remarried Pan Jingyu (22 years old), a woman from Changzhou, through matchmakers Yang Zhifang and Wang Shuying. They rented a house at No. 50 Fengyuli, Route Sapey, in the French Concession and lived together. In October of last year, she gave birth to a daughter, named Dezhen. In January of this year, Xu's wife, Wang Aiyu, came to Shanghai from her hometown to find Xu. After meeting, the couple stayed at No. 12 Dacheng Apartment, Route Paul Beau, in the French Concession. From then on, Xu did not return to Pan's residence to stay overnight. Pan found out that Xu had another lover. Pan was displeased and reported to the French police on April 1, accusing Xu of adultery and requesting detention. The head constable approved the request and sent detectives to Dacheng Apartment, where they detained Xu and Wang Aiyu. After questioning, it was found that Xu and Wang were a formal couple, and the informant was married later, so the police transferred Wang to the court but did not prosecute her and released her immediately. Later, Pan Jingyu reported to the French police, accusing Xu Bozhang of bigamy. Xu was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. After hearing the case, the court ruled that the case was not accepted because the statute of limitations for the crime had expired and the informant had failed to provide active evidence of bigamy. Now, Wang Aiyu has hired lawyer Wang Shizong to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Court, accusing Pan Jingyu of obstructing freedom and false accusations, and has published news in the newspaper to deliberately damage his reputation. Therefore, a civil lawsuit is attached, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for reputation and other losses of 1,000 yuan. After reviewing the lawsuit, the court opened a hearing on the previous day, with Judge Li Changnian presiding. The plaintiff, Wang Aiyu, and her lawyer appeared in court and testified to the previous situation. The defendant and her defense lawyer, Pan Zhensheng, appeared in court and denied the facts of obstructing freedom and false accusations. She stated that Xu Bozhang had harmed her. He initially said that his wife had passed away and married her as a second wife, only to find out that he had deceived her. She did not know that they were a couple, so she reported it to the police. Regarding the private lawsuit for compensation, Xu Bozhang has not come for a long time. Now her life is very difficult, and she has no money to pay him. After the lawyers on both sides debated, the court hearing was declared over, and the verdict was scheduled for July 2.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Falsely Accuses Theft: Chinese Police Provide Proof in Appeal Case</h3>
<p>Prosecutor's Statement of Opinion</p>
<p>On March 16 of this year, Shen Zhixiang, who was working in education at a primary school in Nanlinli, Haining Road, took a French tram. When he boarded in the French Concession, a ticket seller No. 187, Chen Anan, accused him of being a thief and reported it to Chinese Constable No. 256, who detained Shen in the police station and transferred him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Xu and Lu, two passengers on the same tram, testified in court, proving the quarrel between Chen and Shen, and that he was falsely accused of stealing. The judge then declared Shen Zhixiang innocent and transferred Chen to the procuratorate for investigation for false accusations. After the public prosecution was filed, Chen Anan was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for false accusations. Because Chen did not accept the verdict, she hired lawyer Xu Heling to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Huanbiao, the chief judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, and Judges Wang and Dong, prosecutors, opened the hearing. The appellant, Chen Anan, said that Shen Zhixiang and two accomplices had stolen corner tickets from her money bag. She called the police to arrest them, but she was instead sentenced for false accusations, so she did not accept the appeal. The official said that even if petty thieves stole, they would not commit crimes against you. Then, Chinese Constable No. 256 was called to the court to swear and prove that the stolen corner tickets were taken out of Chen Anan's own money bag by Chen Anan. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Dong Qiming stated that the appellant had detained Shen Zhixiang and three others at the time. If they were thieves, they must have fled quickly, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. Now, among the ticket sellers on general trams, it is difficult to find one or two out of a hundred passengers who are gentle and respectful. Most of them rely on the company and are arrogant and overbearing, and quarreling and scolding are common. Poor people always suffer losses. If someone wearing a uniform or decent clothes falsely accuses a coolie of theft, the patrolmen will definitely believe it. According to the crime of false accusation, the sentence is imprisonment of not more than seven years. Normally, at least three years would not be surprising. Now that the appellant is only sentenced to six months' imprisonment, it should be requested to maintain the original judgment and reject the appeal. At the end, the appellant's defense lawyer debated, and the court declared the end of the session, and the verdict was scheduled for the 30th. The appellant still paid the original bail of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Special News from the Municipal Senior Nursing School</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in order to cultivate excellent nurses to assist in promoting health and treatment, submitted a proposal to the Municipal Government for approval last year to open a senior nursing school. Only female junior high school graduates who have passed a strict examination are allowed to enroll. At that time, there were more than one hundred applicants, but only nineteen were admitted. During the re-examination, another five were eliminated before being allowed to try out. After a half-year trial period, another three were eliminated. Therefore, there are currently only eleven regular students, which shows the strictness of the teaching. The school is sponsored by the Municipal Health Bureau. In addition to full-time teachers, senior staff of the bureau with knowledge and experience serve as part-time teachers, which is of great benefit to the students. Moreover, the students have the opportunity to intern at the municipal hospitals, smoking cessation hospitals, health experiment stations, health services offices, etc. affiliated with the Health Bureau. The school's facilities are also very complete, which is a rare opportunity. In order to promote talent cultivation, the school is now scheduled to test the second class of 20 students on July 14. Once admitted, they only need to pay a fee of eighty-five yuan to officially enroll and study. Afterwards, there is no need to continue paying for tuition, room, and board. Registration has already begun. Those who are interested in studying can send a two-cent stamp to the school inside the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital on Tongji Road, Zhabei, to request a copy of the regulations and register for the examination.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Oil Pressing Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 29)</p>
<p>3. Current Situation of Oil Pressing Factories in this City</p>
<p>Although each oil pressing factory produces cotton oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, raw oil, and coconut oil, they usually focus on cotton oil and soybean oil, followed by rapeseed oil and raw oil. They are often produced when business for cotton oil and soybean oil is slow, so they are only secondary businesses of the oil pressing factories in this city. Now, the existing oil pressing factories in this city, selecting those with larger scales, will be described separately as follows:</p>
<p>1. Changde Oil Pressing Factory - The factory address is in Zhangjiabin, Pudong. The wholesale office is located in Changyi Rice Shop in Doushi Street. It was founded at the end of 1933 and started pressing oil in June 1934. The capital was originally 300,000 yuan and has now increased to 400,000 yuan. In the past, each share was 100 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 20 yuan. The factory mainly produces soybean oil. It is said that it will soon also be pressing cottonseed oil. Business has been good over the years. The current directors are Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Qi Zhi, Qu Songjia, Xu Guannan, Huang Songfu, Yan Xiaojia, Chen Yuming, and Xu Shenru.</p>
<p>2. Dade Xin Oil Pressing Factory - This factory was transformed from the former Dade Jin Oil Factory. It was established in 1930. The capital was originally 150,000 taels, but now it has increased to 300,000 yuan. The special affairs office is located on the second floor of 105 Jiangxi Road. There are two factory sites. The first factory is at 172 Maigen Road, and the second factory is at Yangjiadu, Pudong. The director and manager is Mr. Zhu Zuye, and the director and assistant manager is Mr. Cao Xingeng. The factory produces four types of oil: cottonseed oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, and tung oil.</p>
<p>3. Lide Oil Factory - This factory has been established for more than 40 years. The office is located at No. 7 Bund, French Concession. The factory building is located at No. 78, the end of Gordon Road, north of Suzhou Creek. The factory owner and manager is Mr. Liu Changyin, the deputy manager is Mr. Liu Zhixiang, and the factory director is Mr. Liu Changyin's eldest son, Liu Shunde. The factory base area reaches more than 40 mu, including the machinery, which is worth about 1 million yuan. From August of last year to July of this year, the factory used about 350,000 dan of raw cottonseed and obtained 34,500 dan of cottonseed oil.</p>
<p>4. Shunyu Machine Oil Pressing Factory - This factory was established in 1919. It was reorganized once in August 1932. The distribution office is located at No. 112 Avenue Haig. The factory address is at No. 8, Guangfu Road, north of Caojiabang. The capital is 250,000 yuan. The chairman of the board is Mr. Zhang Zhiqin. Mr. Zhu Jingan, Cai Qiqing, and He Shuming are all directors of the factory. The factory site covers an area of 18 mu. The products are mainly cottonseed oil and soybean oil.</p>
<p>5. Dayouyu Oil Pressing Factory - This factory was established in 1921. Initially, the scale was small. However, after merging with Dasheng and Xinchang factories in 1928, the scale gradually expanded and the capital increased to 300,000 yuan. The factory is located at No. 36, West Suzhou Road (the end of Gordon Road). The office is located in Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. The chairman of the board is Mr. Qin Runliu, and the director and manager is Mr. Zhang Xiqing. The products include four types of oil: soybean oil, cottonseed oil, raw oil, and coconut oil.</p>
<p>6. Dachang Xin Oil Pressing Factory - This factory was transformed from Dachang Oil Pressing Company. It was established in 1933 with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The distribution office is located on Zhubao San Road, French Concession. The factory address is at Guangfu Road, north of Tanjia Ferry, covering an area of about 12 mu. Zhang Caisheng, Lu Chenglin, Zhang Meicheng, Cao Keshan, and Qian Zhongqing are all directors of the factory. The business is quite prosperous. Unfortunately, it was reported in January last year that the factory building was destroyed by fire. However, it is still operating and pressing oil as usual. It was reorganized once this year, adding the name "Run Ji", and the capital increased to 250,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Suiwan Oil Pressing Factory and Changji Oil Pressing Factory are also leaders in this industry in this city. The factory address is in Caojiadu. The capital is 40,000 yuan. It was founded more than ten years ago and has a long history.</p>
<p>In addition, the machinery used by each oil pressing factory varies greatly. According to the different types of oil presses, those for pressing soybean oil cannot press other types of oil. As for the pressing of cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, and raw oil, the same machine can be used. At the same time, the machines for pressing soybean oil are divided into new and old types. The old-fashioned oil press is commonly known as the screw car, which is manually operated and requires about eight workers per car, and the output is not high. The new-style oil press is quite advanced, and it can press six times a day and night, each time pressing 14 jin of soybean cake.</p>
<p>4. Sales Channels and Market Conditions</p>
<p>The sales channels for the products of each oil pressing factory in this city are largest for soybean oil and soybean cake. Soybean oil is mostly supplied to residents of this city for consumption. Soybean cake is divided into several types, including first-grade, second-grade, third-grade, fourth-grade, and fifth-grade. The first-grade weighs 62 pounds per piece, the third-grade weighs 58 pounds, the fourth-grade weighs 54 pounds, and the fifth-grade weighs 50 pounds, but in reality, there is no consistency. The main sales channel for soybean cake is Shantou, with the peak season being from November each year to March or April of the following year, as it is the time for cultivating fruit trees. Other sales areas include Wenzhou, Taizhou, and the vicinity of this city. Cottonseed oil is mostly sold abroad, and some is also purchased in this city for use as food, but the amount is limited. As for cottonseed cake, it is entirely sold to Japan for use as fertilizer. Foreign firms such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yoshida in Shanghai all purchase large quantities. Coconut oil is mostly sold to soap factories in this city as a raw material for making soap, and the oil cake is only used as feed for cattle and other livestock. Cantonese people prefer raw oil, which is mainly sold to South China. As for the price of soybean oil, it was only about 11 yuan per dan in the spring of last year. After autumn, due to poor soybean harvests on the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, the price of soybeans rose, and the price of oil immediately rose to 14 or 15 yuan. Currently, it has risen to 22 yuan and 4 jiao, which is similar in Dalian. The price of first-grade soybean cake in the spring of last year was only about 1 yuan and 6 jiao per piece, but it also gradually increased. Now it has risen to 2 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. As for the market price of third-grade, fourth-grade, and fifth-grade, it has also increased accordingly. The price of third-grade is...</p>

<h3>Next Olympic Games Location</h3>
<p>Italy Supports Japan</p>
<p>Italy Requests to Host in 1944</p>
<p>Paris, 27th (Havas) - Regarding the location for the 12th Olympic Games in 1940, England, Japan, and Finland are currently competing. The "Sports News" here recently reported a dispatch from Rome stating that the Italian Olympic Association will soon make a decision on this matter. Although Italy once requested that Rome be the location, it will now abandon this idea and support Japan's request for Tokyo to be the location of the next Olympic Games. According to the International Olympic Committee, when it met in the capital of Norway in February last year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini told Japanese Ambassador Sugimura in Rome that if the 1944 Olympic Games could be held in Italy, then Italy would support the 1940 Games being held in Japan. Since the Italian Prime Minister has already made this statement, the country's position can be expected to support Japan's proposal at the meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Berlin next month.</p>

<h3>Dongya Sports Academy Swimming Pool Open</h3>
<p>The swimming pool built by the Dongya Sports Academy in Weinan, in this city, was originally intended for students to practice, but the school authorities, based on their consistent aim of promoting social sports, open it every season for people from the outside to practice. The pool pays great attention to hygiene and changes the water every one or two days, and the water is changed daily on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, so the cost of water is very high. In order to recover this water cost, special two-month tickets are sold for 5 yuan, one-month tickets for 2 yuan, and temporary tickets for 2 jiao. However, in order to avoid congestion, tickets are sold for 2 jiao on Saturdays and Sundays. It is heard that the pool will open today, and the measures will be the same as before.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sets July 1st as the Implementation Date for Zhuyin Hanzi</h3>
<p>All Elementary School Textbooks Must Adopt Them, Otherwise the Ministry of Education Will Definitely Not Approve Them</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) The promotion of Zhuyin Hanzi will be implemented from July 1st. According to Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, this will be of great help to popular education, compulsory education, and mass education.

<h3>Method of Distributing Education Subsidies</h3>
<p>Planned by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) The 25th year of education, culture, and professional subsidy funds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board have been formulated by the Education Committee of the Board on the 16th and 17th, and submitted for discussion and approval at the 39th meeting of the Board on the 20th and 22nd. According to the person in charge of the Board, there were 73 applications for funds this year, totaling more than 8,210,000 yuan. However, the interest income is only sufficient to cover the use of 2,760,000 yuan this year. A total of more than 30,000 yuan was raised to make a total of 2,800,000 yuan. The distribution of funds will pay attention to the following three points: (1) remote and inland provinces, (2) relatively poor provinces and institutions, (3) vocational education and primary and secondary schools. This will also take into account the urgency of various domestic undertakings and the actual situation of various localities as the basis for deliberating and deciding on the method of distribution.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Completes Review of Subsidies for Various Schools</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) In order to reward and assist the development of excellent private colleges and above, the Ministry of Education has set up a subsidy of 720,000 yuan per year since the 23rd year, which has been in place for two years. Many of the subsidized schools have shown special achievements. The Ministry of Education has proposed to increase the budget for this subsidy by more than 100,000 yuan in the 25th year, but it has not been realized due to the country's financial difficulties. It is estimated that 44 schools have applied for subsidies in the 25th year, totaling more than 2,900,000 yuan, but they will still be distributed according to 720,000 yuan. The Ministry of Education convened a meeting of the review committee on the 25th, and based on the amount applied for by each school and with reference to the inspection report, the review was completed on the 27th, and the results will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing and promulgation.</p>

Saturday, June 27th, was the third day of the graduation ceremony week. At 10:00 AM, visitors were welcomed. Many guests from all walks of life and parents of students attended. At 11:00 AM, the groundbreaking ceremony for the Automatic Machinery Engineering Laboratory was held. First, President Li delivered a speech, stating that the construction of this laboratory relied heavily on the financial support of the government and other institutions. He also thanked Dean Duan Xing, Secretary Cai Xingwu, Engineer Qian Changgan, Professor Shi Ying, and Professor Huang Jiubei for their meticulous planning, which led to its success. Next, Dean Hu, who also serves as the Dean of the Mechanical Engineering College, reported that the school had long desired to build a laboratory for students and faculty to conduct research due to the lack of machinery for various transportation projects. However, it could not be realized due to limited funding. He expressed his great pleasure at the completion of the laboratory. The construction and equipment of this laboratory cost less than 100,000 yuan, which is only a basic scale. It will be gradually expanded in the future. Subsequently, President Li broke ground, followed by a speech by Mr. Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office. At 12:00 PM, the initiation ceremony for new members of the Tao Pei Society was held at the faculty club. The graduates of this year who were selected as members of the society include Fan Tang, Qiu Xuantong, Liu Huida, Xu Changyu, Liu Huishi, Zhu Renkan, Ling Songnian, and Wang Zhaozhen from Shanghai colleges, and Xia Sunding and Wang Yongzhen from Tangshan Engineering College. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the 36th graduation ceremony was held in the Wenzhi Hall. Among those present that day were Director Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, representing the National Government, Fan Shouzhi, representing former Minister of Railways Ye, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways, Vice Minister Peng of the Ministry of Communications, and Pan Guanghui. After the ceremony, President Li gave a report, awarded diplomas, and presented awards. Next, Chairman Lin of the National Government gave a speech, which was announced by Director Pan on his behalf. The speech stated, "Learn to apply, practice diligently, cultivate virtue and achieve talent, shoulder heavy responsibilities and strive for great achievements, aspire to all directions, be selected from thousands, unite sincerely, work hard to create, Yu said calluses, Mo called Chonglan, Gang vigorously improves goodness," Next, the Deputy Minister of Women's Affairs of the Ministry of Communications gave a speech, stating that graduation is a crucial moment for you to leave student life and enter social service. The Ministry of Railways and your teachers have worked hard for four years to cultivate you. The country and society have great expectations for you. The transportation sector in China will from now on add a new force. The progress of China's transportation in recent years depends on the alumni who have graduated from this school for 40 years. Next, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways gave a speech, stating that "Jiaotong University has a history of 40 years and has graduated three to four thousand students. It is truly the only university in the country that bears a major mission and has a long history. Since President Li took office, there has been considerable progress. All the work of the Ministry of Railways cannot be separated from the assistance of the alumni of Jiaotong University. The alumni of Jiaotong University should also rely on the Ministry of Railways to seek development for the country. Today, let's talk about the future cultivation and social needs of graduates. Each year, a batch of university graduates, not many of whom can work hard and move forward, and quite a few degenerate due to the adverse environment. This is often due to the difficulty of getting rid of the drive of adverse environments after entering society, so there are few opportunities to continue studying and researching. Once new talents emerge, the old ones will naturally decline and be eliminated. Today, university students generally have three major shortcomings after graduating and serving society. First, they lack the determination to work hard and improve. Second, they cannot cooperate effectively. Third, they lack the cultivation of leadership knowledge. China has a large number of university students, but the country does not see significant progress because university students cannot fully achieve their effectiveness after entering society. Therefore, the advancement of careers is hindered. I hope that the 200 graduates of this school this year can achieve the work efficiency of 200 people in the future. China's railways currently only have 7,000 kilometers, and it is planned to add 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers within two or three years. This certainly requires the promotion of financial resources and manpower. If you want to create a very long line in a short period of time and want to use less people and less materials, this depends on the hard work of the staff. The Ministry of Railways will need talents in the future, so it has great hopes for you. Your services will still be handled according to past practices, but I hope you will work harder and endure more hardship. We should take this as the center of the graduates, correct the past, and point to the future, with the goal of "no corruption on the railways" to create a new spirit of the Ministry of Railways' future work. The Ministry of Railways should protect the progress of Jiaotong University, and Jiaotong University should also maintain its past relationship with the Ministry of Railways." Finally, Hu Jiaofu, a representative of the faculty and staff, gave a speech, followed by a reply from the graduate representative Yin Baotai. After the ceremony, photos were taken on the playground, and a tea party was held for teachers and students to say goodbye. In the evening, the faculty and staff club held a reunion at the gymnasium, which lasted until late at night.</p>
<p>President Li reported that the school has been stable over the past year. Although the school's affairs and academics have been maintained despite limited funding, thanks to the encouragement of Mr. Zhujiao Chang and others, they have been able to responsibly manage their work, which is particularly memorable. As the 36th graduation ceremony is held, I would like to express my gratitude and report the status of the school as follows: (1) The school has always valued quality over quantity. The number of students registered in each college is roughly the same as in previous years. This semester, there are 684 people at the Shanghai headquarters, including 35 female students, 176 at the Tangshan campus, including 2 female students, and 161 at the Pingyuan campus, including 16 female students, for a total of 1,021 people. This year's graduates include 17 from the Shanghai College of Science, 92 from the College of Management, 21 from the College of Civil Engineering, 37 from the College of Mechanical Engineering, 23 from the College of Electrical Engineering, 20 from the Tangshan College of Engineering in Civil Engineering, 2 in Mining and Metallurgy, and 41 from the Beiping Railway Management College, for a total of 213 people, including 17 female students. Among the female graduates this year, there is one each who graduated in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering, which is not only rare in the engineering education field but also an unprecedented feature of the school. (2) This year, due to the increase in subjects and personnel changes, new teachers have been hired. At the headquarters, there is Mr. Xu Pei, a Belgian engineer specially hired with the subsidy of the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee, as well as professors such as Qian Naizhen, Ma Baodian, and Jiang Shangying. At the Tangshan campus, there are professors such as Duan Maohan and Zhang Ziping. As for important staff members, they remain the same and have not been changed. (3) In order to adapt to the needs of the times, the school has added a class of automatic machinery to the College of Mechanical Engineering and a fourth-year class to the Public Administration Department of the College of Management. This year, students have graduated, setting new records. In addition, since the preparation for the Textile Department, machinery has gradually been equipped to meet the needs of experiments. In addition to Professor Bai Ke leading various teachers in research and investigation, a curriculum has also been drafted, but a class has not yet been decided to be enrolled. (4) According to the approved budget, new equipment worth about 100,000 yuan has been purchased, including surveying instruments, generators, ammeters, textile machines, special engineering equipment, modern physics instruments, quantitative chemistry experiments, and food. Donations from the outside include a gas generator donated by the China Gas Sound Manufacturing Company, a four-cylinder car donated by Dr. Shen Gong, an electric key donated by Siemens Electric Factory, and an induction motor manufactured and donated by Huacheng Electric Appliance Factory. As for books, except for a part that was donated, only about 20,000 yuan was purchased due to limited funding. (5) The Shanghai headquarters built a new library book depot last year, which cost more than 20,000 yuan, including copper bookshelves. It has all been completed. The Chemistry Department expanded its industrial chemistry equipment, requiring a 5,000-square-foot building, which cost about 10,000 yuan and is under construction. The Automatic Machinery Engineering Laboratory of the College of Mechanical Engineering has a fixed plan and needs 15,000 yuan, and the groundbreaking has begun. The Pingyuan campus has added a classroom building and a library and museum this year. Other buildings that have been completed or will be started include small-scale student dormitories in Shanghai and Pingyuan, and faculty residences in Tangshan. (6) The school believes that school education focuses on improving the physical fitness of all students, so this year, in addition to military training and extracurricular sports, physical education has been added as a formal course and taught on time, the same as other required courses. Since the trial implementation in Shanghai and Tangshan, the results have been quite impressive. (7) Many students from the school have been admitted to various overseas study programs with public funding, and many have gone abroad for research or internships at their own expense. This year, there are more than 30 people, including 10 from the graduating class. After the Tangshan campus ordered regulations for purchasing teachers and teaching assistants to study abroad, two teaching assistants have also gone to the United States to study for further education. (8) In addition to the subsidies allocated by government agencies and the equipment donated by various manufacturers, the principal also conducted memorial fundraising for the 40th anniversary of the school. For example, the Class of 1919 has pledged 1,000 yuan for the school's scholarship. Furthermore, the Shanghai headquarters of the school has been established for 40 years, and the Tangshan and Pingyuan campuses have a history of about 30 years. The three locations have a total of 16 disciplines, and more than 3,000 students have graduated, many of whom have made achievements in transportation and construction. The school has contributed more and more to the country and society, and the expectations of the Chinese people for the school are also increasing. At this time of severe national crisis and turbulent environment, I am deeply concerned about the difficulty of maintaining stability. How can we enable this long-standing institution to maintain its inherent position, develop its strengths, and fulfill its mission? This, in addition to the school's colleagues striving to encourage themselves, must rely on the support and supervision of the government and society.</p>

<h3>Exchange Market: Near Tight, Far Loose - Foreign Firms Settle, Banks Hold, Chinese Merchants Watch</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday was characterized by foreign firms still selling, banks holding, and Chinese merchants watching, resulting in near-term tightness and long-term looseness. At the beginning of the morning, according to overseas radio stations, London's large spreads narrowed by 125 in the near term and 1875 in the long term. Dealers claimed that buyers were following the posted prices after the market closed, while sellers were watching.

<h3>Securities Market: Investor Sentiment Anxious and Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the unclear situation in the Southwest, market sentiment remained apprehensive about whether war could be avoided. Coupled with the increasingly urgent crisis in North China, this caused further doubts. Major players in the market shifted to short selling, while retail investors engaged in covering, creating a temporary lull. However, it is feared that this will ultimately be unsustainable. Yesterday's activity saw significant buying of issues No. 10 and No. 59 at the opening, with retail investors particularly active in short covering, causing prices to rise uniformly by about 30-40 cents. The subsequent session saw confusion, with fluctuating prices varying by only about 10 cents. Trading volume also decreased noticeably. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to actively cover shorts, while issues No. 4 and No. 11 continued to be sold, causing prices to rise again by 5 cents to 10-30 cents. At the close, long positions were mostly sold off, generally retreating by 5 cents to 10-35 cents. Overall, prices rose uniformly by about 10 cents to half a yuan. The total transaction volume was 5.8055 million yuan. A comparative table of the price increases and decreases is shown below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Lack of Market Enthusiasm, Yarn Prices Wavering, Foreign Cotton Price Surge Unaffected</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced morning gains followed by afternoon weakness, with prices wavering again. Although global yarn and cotton conditions continued to reach new highs, local market sentiment remained unenthusiastic, primarily due to weak real demand, ample yarn inventories in warehouses, and inactive short sellers, resulting in a dull and lifeless market.</p>
<p>Weak Bidding for Traded Yarn: In the morning trading of traded yarn, prices rose across all months by 60-80 cents due to rising overseas yarn and cotton prices and short covering. However, buying interest was weak, and momentum waned. As a result, prices across all months fell by 20-30 cents compared to the morning close. A total of 550 bales of Dafu yarn, 650 bales of Jinchang yarn, 500 bales of Mingde yarn, 500 bales of Runlian yarn, and 400 bales of Senkang yarn were sold. The daily high and low prices, as well as the closing prices, are listed below.</p>
<p>Sluggish Sales of Spot Yarn: Sales of spot yarn remained sluggish. A total of 335 bales were purchased by various dealers throughout the day at prices ranging from 25 cents to 50 cents. Purchase volumes by different groups are as follows.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Dumping, Heavy Pressure on Cotton Futures</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced morning gains followed by afternoon declines. Although Indian and American cotton both increased in price, local sentiment remained exceptionally subdued, with cotton merchants generally inclined to dump inventory, resulting in heavy pressure. Simultaneously, spot cotton trading declined, with a severe shortage of high-quality goods. The converted prices for Indian and American cotton continued to soar.</p>
<p>Decline in Afternoon Traded Cotton: In the morning trading of traded cotton, prices rose across all months by 110-130 cents due to rising American cotton (up 8-9 British pounds), old cotton (up 17 British pounds), Indian cotton (coarse wool up 5 rupees, fine wool up 1.75-3.5 rupees), and Osaka Sanpin cotton (up 50-60 cents). Market sentiment was excited, and buying interest was relatively strong. However, prices reversed and fell after the second and third sessions. As a result, prices across all months rose by only 10-20 cents compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening was lackluster, as cotton merchants generally anticipated a decline in old cotton prices, causing market sentiment to weaken. As a result, July and August prices fell by 15-25 cents compared to the morning close. New cotton remained unchanged, while cotton inventories continued to dwindle. A total of 1,100 dan of Dafeng cotton, 2,700 dan of Tongji cotton, 1,900 dan of Yuda cotton, 1,000 dan of Hexing cotton, 1,100 dan of Fengtai cotton, 2,600 dan of Changfeng cotton, 3,200 dan of Runkang cotton, 2,700 dan of Xincheng cotton, 1,200 dan of Yicheng cotton, and 1,800 dan of Yichang cotton were sold. 1,500 dan of Mingde cotton, 1,900 dan of Zhenda cotton, 3,600 dan of Senlian cotton, 3,300 dan of Changyu cotton, 1,600 dan of Taichang cotton, 4,000 dan of Changhe cotton, 1,600 dan of Dachangcheng cotton, and 1,100 dan of Yongda cotton were purchased. The daily high and low prices, as well as the closing prices, are listed below.</p>
<p>Continued Shortage of High-Grade Cotton: Consumption of spot cotton turned sluggish due to the lack of high-quality goods. 380 bales of "Yao" cotton arrived.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Rises Again, Indian Cotton Rises Especially Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with positive news from Liverpool. Traders in Liverpool and Mumbai, along with industry peers, were all buyers, with prices rising by 5-8 British pounds across all months. Simultaneously, short sellers, Wall Street, brokers, and New Orleans also began buying. When prices reached new highs, long positions were slightly liquidated, but were absorbed by industry peers. Subsequently, short covering in July futures led to renewed price increases. It was reported that Texas experienced only light rain, with high temperatures remaining, drawing considerable attention. Spot prices remained firm and high. H. Hester's estimated weekly mill consumption at 188,000 bales, with Liverpool's stock at 291,000 bales. The close was firm, with spot prices up 17 British pounds and futures up 8-17 British pounds. British spot cotton rose 11 points and futures rose 12-13 points. Indian cotton prices rose sharply due to buying from industry peers, speculators, and sellers, with July futures experiencing slight hedging. Bengal cotton rose 3.25-5 rupees, Oomra cotton rose 2.5-3 rupees, and Broach cotton rose 1.75-3.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated 26th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening prediction for Broach cotton futures for April-May on the 27th was 215 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Prices of Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Also Rise</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 27th, Sanpin yarn futures rose 1-1.6 yuan, with near-month contracts at 204.3 yuan and far-month contracts at 198.8 yuan. Cotton futures rose 0.55-0.65 yuan, with near-month contracts at 66.2 yuan and far-month contracts at 62.15 yuan.</p>

<h3>Grains: Factories Dumping Steadily, Flour Market Initially Flat Then Lively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced an initial period of flatness followed by increased activity. Prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada uniformly fell by about 60-70 cents, causing initial quotes for near-term months to retreat slightly by 1 cent. However, sentiment for October contracts remained strong, showing no weakness. Consequently, quotes for all months began to improve gradually from the second session. Although it is currently the new wheat season, factories in both local and foreign areas are acting cautiously due to the turbulent times, and are shifting their dumping activities along with the import of wheat. Market sentiment is unlikely to decline significantly in the short term. The afternoon opening saw trading largely stalled for all months, with minimal activity. The market trended sideways. Industry insiders speculate that future price fluctuations will depend on the growth or decline of actual sales. However, due to the poor social environment and lack of speculative enthusiasm, the market situation often does not align with actual conditions.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Trading, Stable Wheat Futures, Spot Wheat Continues to Rise by Two Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was generally stable in the morning session. Prices for foreign wheat retreated significantly. However, domestic conditions remained unstable, and news of Eastern merchants purchasing wheat in Wuhu, although in limited quantities, attracted attention. As a result of these conflicting factors, trading volume was low, and price fluctuations were minimal. Trading was more active in the afternoon opening, with prices fluctuating. Compared to the previous day's closing price, better grades rose by 2-4 cents. The spot wheat market saw high-grade goods competing with each other, with prices remaining between 4.2 yuan. Medium-grade goods continued to rise in price by 2 cents. The total volume traded in the general market was over 10,000 bags. Prices in inland areas have eased due to abundant arrivals and favorable weather conditions. Future price declines may occur due to the interplay of supply and demand.</p>
<p>It was reported that the US wheat market experienced scattered showers, with slightly cooler weather. Conditions in Canada remained unchanged, but rain is needed, and short selling is increasing. Showers are expected soon.</p>
<h3>Transactions Only for Social Purposes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, merchants continued to arrive in an endless stream, but sales significantly decreased. Although the North China group inquired about Jiangxi rice for the Beiyang region and the inland group sought to procure Jiangxi rice from Zhongguan, the volume traded was small. Transactions between the inland group and the North China group were less than 1,000 bags. Sales in the local market were also less active than in previous days. Socially motivated transactions involved over 1,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 100 bags each of Ningbo willow rice and Jiangbei machine rice, and 250 bags of small-grain rice. Total daily transactions amounted to only 3,000 bags, mostly for social purposes. Small-grain rice saw a slight price increase, while "Ke Xian" rice also experienced small price increases ranging from a few cents to 10 cents. However, after yesterday's socially motivated transactions, sentiment in some parts of the North China group has begun to stir. If sales to North China become brisk in the coming days, market prices could quickly improve.</p>
<h3>River Rice Sales Remain Scattered</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, various groups brought in over 3,000 shi of goods from sources numbered 17 and 18. However, due to the weak sales market and limited purchasing appetite, with only the Dalian group purchasing 700 bags, market conditions remained soft. Prices for thick early rice and thin rice varieties did not fluctuate significantly. Du Yang pointed rice also remained stable. Only "Bian Yuan" rice, which is rare and fragrant, rose by a few cents. "Yin Yuan" rice remained unsold.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, various groups brought in goods from sources numbered 15 and 16 from the river region. Sales remained flat across all goods. Market prices showed a slight increase for white glutinous rice, while thin rice prices increased slightly. Yang Du pointed rice, being rare, maintained stable prices. Sales of "Ke Jian" rice were also sluggish. The market was flat. "Yin Bian Yuan" rice saw a slight decrease of 7-8 cents. Prices for the remaining goods weakened further.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Rises by Twelve Yuan</h3>
<p>The local silk market has been relatively stable due to fluctuating overseas silk prices with minimal changes. Foreign firms have been selling, but not very smoothly. Yesterday, New York silk prices fell again. The price of Japanese silk (75 and 83 degrees), Chinese silk (Shanghai silk 78 degrees and Guangdong silk), fell by two cents per pound. In Lyon, France, except for the Japanese silk, which rose one franc, prices for the rest of the silk held steady. London silk prices remained unchanged for a long time. Shanghai silk A-grade 13.22 still sells for six shillings and ten and a half pence, and B-grade sells for six shillings and four and a half pence. Yesterday, Yokohama silk prices were stable, with current sales rising by twelve yuan.</p>
<h3>Viscose Rayon Sells Better in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Viscose rayon transactions were even lighter. However, market prices remained stable. The 120-count "Tianqiao" brand marked by customs sold over twenty boxes at a price of four hundred and ten yuan. The buyers are local silk factories. There is a lack of European cargo transactions, and even then they are few and far between. The 120-count "Tianqiao" brand in Shaoxing and Hangzhou is priced at more than 430 yuan. Other brands and European cargo have little movement.</p>
<h3>Drawn Core Chunmee Tea Prices Fall to Boost Sales, Scented Black Tea Most Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw continued active trading. The entire market traded more than 5,600 boxes of Keemun black tea and green tea from Tunxi, Wuyuan, Suian and other places. The black tea market is still most popular for the floral aroma type, but there are not many goods coming in, which cannot meet the demand. Keemun black tea, Tianyu Foreign Company reopened, the situation is quite stable. Sales of Tunxi Chunmee remained sluggish. Jinlong, Tongfu, and Yongxing all slightly consumed Huizhou Chunmee and low-grade drawn core tea. The entire market traded nearly 300 boxes. Low-grade "Xiu Mei" tea, glass-like in color (Tripoli), Xiehe and Jinlong sold hundreds of boxes, priced from 18 yuan to 23-24 yuan. Sui Zhen Yihe sent out a telegram, but the inventory is not large and sales are still acceptable. The market is quite stable. Wubei drawn core tea opened at 119 yuan. Overall, the various Chunmee teas have been quite active this week, especially Tunxi Chunmee, which is more popular and profitable, and prices have also increased. As for Ping Shui tea, Yihe handled more than 100 pieces of Zhucha yesterday, priced at 54 yuan. Although prices of Ping Shui teas have stabilized this week, transactions are much lighter than last week.</p>
<h3>Metals: Shortage of Sheet Iron, Market Firm</h3>
<p>Although the sheet iron business is not high for customer groups, transactions at factories are more active. Due to the thin profits of this commodity, traders purchased very little, so inventory is shallow and prices are very firm. For example, the 20-28 inch Zheng Hao goods are priced at 65 yuan to 70 yuan per box (due to deferred payment and cash payment relations, there are price variations up and down of 5 yuan), while the secondary goods commonly known as "wild chicken" sheet iron sell for 51-52 yuan per box. It was found that about 30 boxes were put on the market yesterday, so the inventory is even weaker.</p>

<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Lacks Large-Scale Sales Channels</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market has been affected by the current situation. Sentiments are not consistent, and sales are limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of large-scale sales channels, so market sentiment is still slack. Yesterday, the Hunan province group imported more than 200 pieces of various local factory goods, such as "Yu Ye Fu" silk and lower-grade fine twill silk. The Hunan group accumulated local factory twill goods. They purchased fine "Ji Zhi" patterned wool fabric, satin and patterned velvet. The Hankou group imported more than 100 pieces of goods such as local factory fine twill, bleached cloth, and striped plain "Fu" silk. The local wholesale shops imported more than 200 pieces of goods such as local factory striped plain "Fu" silk, cotton cloth, linen yarn, clear water bleached cloth, and foreign yarn. White and coarse cloth is overstocked, and sales are sluggish. Demand for foreign yuan is still high. Factory raw cloth is more than 20 cents per bolt. Because of the large increase in sales of Dong goods raw cloth, the production of various factories has gradually become scarce. Prices have risen by 20-30 cents per bolt. Deep-colored "Ke" silk from various factories has also increased in price by 10-20 cents due to the increase in raw cloth prices. All other goods are flat. Fine Eastern goods have fallen again by two and a half cents per bolt.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Shrimp Firm, Dried Crab Declines</h3>
<p>Both Supply and Sales of Shrimp Tails are Weak, Market Stable</p>
<p>(Shrimp Tails) Recently, goods arriving from various places have been sluggish. Because it is the flood season, it is very easy to spoil, so the sales of the customer groups are also very scattered. Most of the merchants with more inventory in this area have moved to cold storage to prepare for re-selling in the autumn. Therefore, the current market cannot fall, nor is it easy to rise. The merchant's selling price is 112 yuan for high-quality yuan dong tails and 107-108 yuan for mixed goods. 98 yuan to 93 yuan for Chao Shan tails. 112 yuan for Jinhou tails in cold storage and 100 yuan for new hot water goods. Small ones sell for 96 yuan. Large Jinshan tails are out of stock. Medium-sized ones are priced at 130 to 128 yuan, and small ones are priced at 122 yuan. Off-colored ones are priced at 116 yuan, and Tian Bian tails are priced at 100 yuan. Local tails sell for 75-76 yuan, and domestic Yantai tails sell for 55 yuan. Chao Shen goods sell for 42 yuan, and small ones sell for 34 yuan to 28 yuan. Si tails sell for 22 yuan.</p>
<p>(Dried Shrimp) During the second flood, when the new goods were emerging from the water, it happened to be cloudy and rainy, making it difficult for the goods to dry, resulting in huge losses. Because the source is scarce, the price is high. However, the second flood harvest has not been abundant. Good, dry, and well-bodied goods sell for 130 yuan, the original natural-colored goods sell for 120 yuan, and damp goods sell for 100 yuan. If the harvest of the next three floods is not strong, the market may ease.</p>
<p>(Dried Crab) Ningbo outside mountain goods have arrived, but customer sales have not yet developed, and the market has already declined. Yesterday's sales were priced at 30 yuan for well-colored and dry goods, and 24 to 22 yuan for original goods. The market situation is mediocre.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Vegetables: Haikou Branches Open at a Lower Price of Three to Four Yuan</h3>
<p>The two batches of Haikou branches and water geng branches, a total of 565 boxes, transported from Suozhou the day before yesterday, were all sampled yesterday. The market was expected to be slightly stable, but because the first batch of ordinary merchant goods were not very marketable, and some were returned after they were put out, market sentiment went down, falling by three to four yuan. The initial price for water branches was 23 yuan, then 18-19 yuan, and then 14-15 yuan to 12 yuan. The transactions were handled by each merchant. As more goods arrive in the future, prices may need to be loosened again.</p>
<h3>New Melon Seed Prices are Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>Excessive Drought Reduces Production</p>
<p>According to the letter from Xuzhou, due to the excessive drought and the planting of cotton in some production areas, although rain has been seen recently, the output will definitely be reduced. The new seeds will only be available in about a month. Because of the above reasons, the price may not be too small. Most of the merchants here are exchanging old goods with the market. However, since there are more ordinary goods, the selling price is gradually softening. However, high-quality goods are relatively scarce, and the impression is slightly fixed. There is a batch of village seeds that will arrive from Xuzhou in the coming days. When the low-price goods can be sold, the market will turn around.</p>

<h3>Children's Life in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The topic "Children's Life in Extraordinary Times" comes from the extraordinary times of politics, economy, education, etc. Everything in the country has shifted from ordinary times to extraordinary times. Children are the roots of the country and the new building of society, so how can they be an exception?</p>
<p>What is children's life in extraordinary times? In my opinion, it should be approached from the following aspects:</p>
<p>Implement New Life Vigorously: The New Life Movement is the only movement to improve national morality and restore social decline. Since its advocacy by Chairman Chiang, it has achieved considerable results. It goes without saying that adults should strive to practice the New Life, but children should also strive to follow the New Life. It should be permissible that in the children's life in this extraordinary period, in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, actions, and words, everything should meet the standards of the New Life. Being able to persevere and form habits will not only be of great benefit to oneself, but also have a great effect on society and the country.</p>
<p>Strive to Forge Physical Fitness: Foreigners often ridicule us as the sick men of East Asia, which we are very ashamed of. In this extraordinary period, in order to eliminate the insulting title of "sick men of East Asia", we must not delay in forging our physical fitness. Children are the pillars of the country, so the forging of children's physical fitness is also an important matter. It is hoped that in this extraordinary period, children will unite and devote two or three hours every day to focus on physical training. If the children of today have healthy bodies, the next generation of citizens will naturally have healthy bodies! By that time, the insult of the sick men of East Asia will naturally be eliminated.</p>
<p>Complete the Children's Airplane: Airplanes are the sharpest weapons in modern warfare. Not long ago, children initiated the raising of funds to purchase a children's airplane to dedicate to the government for use in resisting the enemy. But to this day, the children's airplane has not yet reached the point of completion. In this extraordinary period, we should strive to continue, collect the candy money of children across the country, and complete the children's airplane, which may be possible.</p>
<p>In short, children's life in extraordinary times should be effortful and arduous. I hope that all dear children will rise up - unite and rise up - to implement life in extraordinary times.</p>
<h3>International Children's News</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Summer Vacation Travel</p>
<p>Some children in the United Kingdom are currently in contact with various shipping companies, planning to take advantage of the summer vacation this year to travel to various parts of the British Empire for free, in order to increase their knowledge of the geography and raw material production of the Empire, and to take this opportunity to exchange and learn from children in various territories. Sharing knowledge and building relationships. This plan was initiated by primary school students in London and published in a newspaper. Children from all over the country and Ireland have supported it. There are currently more than forty comrades, aged between eleven and seventeen, and it is expected that the number may reach seventy before the summer vacation this year. The travel expenses required for each person are estimated at 40 pounds. Some educators are currently deliberating all the plans, and there is a good hope that they will become a reality. A child in Wales has even proposed traveling to the Arctic, but failed to obtain the approval of educators, so the proposal has been rejected.</p>
<p>Work Internship</p>
<p>In Moscow, Soviet Union, since October last year, children have organized a children's work group. All children from eight to fifteen years old who are studying at school can join. After joining, they must go to various factories to work for two hours a day outside of class time, without pay. In December, they obtained the permission of the authorities, and immediately there were tens of thousands of children who were assigned to various factories in the city. It was also stipulated that some of the children with the best work performance would be awarded medals after a certain period of time to encourage them. So now there are nearly 100,000 children who have joined this group. Due to the surge in the number of people, it is impossible to accommodate all of them in the factories, so the working hours for each person have been reduced to one hour and fifteen minutes. If the number of children joining continues to increase in the future, the working hours may be further reduced. This movement has now spread very quickly throughout the country. In some collective farms, there are also many children who take turns working in the farms every day. It is estimated that there are already more than 400,000 children working across the country. So in another ten years, when these children grow up, the achievements of production will be even more developed.</p>
<p>Children's Daily</p>
<p>Children in Belgium created a children's daily newspaper called "Belgian Children" in July last year. All the contributors and editors are children under the age of sixteen. The newspaper publishes one and a half sheets a day, with a total of six pages. Advertisements account for two and a half pages, domestic and foreign news accounts for one and a half pages, and the rest are completely published essays, children's science, and literature, with a circulation of just over 10,000 copies. This daily newspaper, although it is affiliated to a weekly magazine, is completely independent in all aspects of editing and publishing except for cooperation in printing. This daily newspaper is not only the best in Europe, but also the only one in the world that is completely run by children.</p>

<h3>Telephone</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One afternoon, Min'er returned home from school, but his father had not yet returned. He knew that his father must have important matters today, because when he returned from school, his father had always finished work and returned home. Suddenly a neighbor said: Your father has important matters today, and I am afraid that he will not be able to come back. He was very surprised to hear that. Can my father make a phone call? In fact, he didn't know what a phone was?</p>
<p>"Another strange thing happened today. How can brother and father make a phone call? Do you know what a phone is?"</p>
<p>"Don't you listen carefully, you're just messing around again. Do you know what a telephone is? It is very wonderful, and can clearly transmit the words of people in very distant places to your ears, one sentence at a time. Don't you think it's strange?"</p>
<p>"It's strange, so what exactly is this telephone? I'm still confused."</p>
<p>"A telephone is something that transmits sound. Its external shape is like a rectangular iron box. On one side of the iron box is something hanging, and there are two speakers at both ends. The one above can be placed on the ear to listen, so it is called the receiver. The one below is for speaking, so it is called the transmitter. There is also an electric wire from this telephone to the two speakers. That electric wire is connected to the telephone exchange, which specializes in telephones. If both parties want to talk, they only need to tell the other party's telephone number to the operator in the telephone exchange, and then they will connect the line you want to talk to, and both parties can talk as if they are facing each other. As for how it can talk? It all depends on these two speakers. When a person speaks to the transmitter, it vibrates the surrounding air, and the air vibrates the film in the machine. The film vibrates with the sound, making the carbon powder in the machine sometimes loose and sometimes tight. It is transmitted through the wire to the other party's receiver. The magnet in the receiver also works, causing the iron film inside the magnet to vibrate. The vibration is exactly the same as the vibration of the film in the transmitter. The other party can hear what you are saying. However, the most indispensable thing for both parties to talk is electricity. If there is no electricity, it will lose its effectiveness." After Cong'er finished saying so much, he was afraid that Min'er would not fully understand, so he took him to the telephone next door to test it for him, so that he could understand the principles one by one.</p>
<h3>Chalk</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Little friends! When you are in class, don't you often see the teacher holding a small piece of chalk in their hand, writing unfamiliar words from your textbooks on the dark blackboard, calling on each of you to recognize them? Hmph! Don't underestimate this little piece of chalk. Is it worth researching? But you must know that the characters you recognize, the arithmetic you learn... which of them isn't written on the blackboard by the teacher using chalk, teaching you how this character should be written, and how writing it that way is wrong. This arithmetic formula should be shown step by step like this. Think: isn't all the knowledge you acquire completely dependent on it? In that case, this little piece of chalk is certainly worth discussing and researching. Little brothers! Little sisters! Today I will talk about how chalk is made. Do you know?</p>
<p>In terms of manufacturing, use one hundred pounds of precipitated calcium carbonate, add a large amount of clean water to make it a thin lime slurry, then use a cloth bag to filter out the coarse residue. After letting it stand to clarify, leave only the appropriate amount of water to make a thick lime slurry. Then add ten pounds of thick wheat starch paste made by boiling wheat starch with water to the lime slurry, and stir it with a stick to make the thick paste and lime mix evenly. Then pour it into a copper mold, and after ten or more minutes, pour it out and dry it in the sun for four or five days to make a piece of dry chalk. There is also an easier method: simply heat gypsum to calcine it into cooked gypsum, grind it finely, wash away the coarse residue with water, take the fine material, mix it with water and mud, pour it into a mold, and after a few minutes, take it out and dry it to make chalk.</p>
<h3>The Farmer's Suffering</h3>
<p>— Fang Wenxue</p>
<p>How miserable are the old farmers! Toiling in the yellow earth all year round, harvesting less than three dan of rice, yet having to pay two and a half dan to the landlord. The children cry from the cold! The wife weeps in bitterness! Coarse vegetable roots and meager rice fill their hungry bellies. Old farmers, never complaining of the hardship! How miserable are the farmers' wives! Weaving homespun cloth in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, unable to weave three bolts of cloth, yet the creditor demands two and a half bolts. The sons cry! The daughters pout! A pair of trousers patched and patched again, farmers' wives, never complaining of the hardship!</p>
<p>Scientific Little Question</p>
<h3>Why Does the Sun Appear Especially Large at Sunrise and Sunset?</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Little friends! If you pay a little attention, you'll notice that in the early morning or evening, when the sun is just above the horizon in the east or west, the sun you see at this time does indeed seem to be more than twice as large as the sun at midday. What is the reason for this? Many people say that it's because the sun is closer to the earth at that time, so it looks bigger. But actually, it's the opposite. The distance at that time is farther than at midday. Doesn't this make it even more magical?</p>
<p>Before I explain the reason, let me first give you an analogy, which will make it easier to understand. Take a chopstick and place half of it diagonally in the water, with the other half outside the water. Then you can see that the half of the chopstick in the water doesn't seem to be the same chopstick as the half outside the water. This is because there are two different mediums between the eye and the chopstick - due to the refraction of light. (The so-called two different mediums are water and air.) So, when we look at the sun, it also passes through two different mediums - air and vacuum. (The area outside the Earth where there is no air is called a vacuum.) When it is midday, the layer of air through which our line of sight passes is, let's say, twenty miles. But when the sun is on the horizon, the layer of air through which our line of sight passes is more than twenty miles. Because both mediums refract light, and the air layer has varying thicknesses, the degree of refraction is also different, and the sun in the human eye appears to be of different sizes.</p>

<h3>Me and the Shen Bao Children's Supplement</h3>
<p>— Lin Zaizheng, Fifth Grade Student, Yinxian County Qishan Elementary School</p>
<p>I am a loyal reader of this publication. I have known this publication for more than a year. During this year, I have never been apart from this publication for a moment. Ah! "Shen Bao Children's Supplement" is truly one of my best 'friends'!</p>
<p>Every time the green-clad postman delivers this "friend" to me, I always dance with joy, filled with indescribable happiness, and hurriedly tear it open. Then I read each article attentively. If I encounter any doubts, I underline them with a pencil and ask my homeroom teacher the next day at school. After understanding the main idea of each article, I also read each one thoroughly, because its content is richer than the lessons in textbooks during class, so it has greatly increased my "knowledge."</p>
<p>In this publication, there are also very meaningful stories, very interesting cartoons, short poems, the long novel "The Righteous Dog's Biography," and the excellent children's corner, as well as various common knowledge... It is truly "all-encompassing" and "has everything," truly a treasure for us elementary school students.</p>
<p>"Shen Bao Children's Supplement" can increase my "knowledge," it can enrich my "common sense," it can urge me to "improve," and it can correct my "mistakes." With these four benefits, it is why I am one of its very best "friends."</p>
<h3>Little Puppet Somersaults</h3>
<p>— Xu Diexian</p>
<p>A small toy made using pencil stubs</p>
<p>Little friends! The pencils you usually use, when they are about to run out and only an inch or so long, don't you usually throw them away because they are not convenient for writing? Now, please keep these short pencil stubs safe, I will teach you how to make a fun toy - a little puppet somersaults - Materials... one pencil stub (about one and a half inches long), four paper clips, one piece of thin wire, one old calligraphy brush (remove the brush head), one piece of thread.</p>
<p>Instructions... First, cut the pencil stub in half, one piece slightly longer, as shown in "Figure 1". Cut the longer piece with a knife at one end, about one-quarter of the way down, to form a head, draw a face with an ink brush, as shown in "Figure 2". Then, split the shorter piece into four with a knife, each piece made thinner (not too thin), as shown in "Figure 2". Use two of the thinned wood pieces to make the hands, cut off two corners at one end, and drill a round hole (be careful when drilling the hole, the hand must be light and slow, or the wood will crack), carve the other end into the shape of a fist, and also drill a hole (slightly smaller), as shown in "Figure 4", and carve the remaining two pieces in the same way to make the feet, as shown in "Figure 5".</p>
<p>Then, cut the paper clips, and nail them into the upper and lower four parts according to "Figure 6", and a small puppet with movable hands and feet is made. Pass the thin wire through the small holes in the puppet's hands, bend it, then pass it through the brush hole (the author pre-drilled two holes), and then bend it into a curved shape, and tie one end with a thread, and the whole work is completed. When playing, hold the brush handle with one hand, and gently pull the thread with the other hand, then the small puppet can move up and down, the posture is like somersaulting on a horizontal bar, infinitely interesting.</p>

<h3>Small Team Markings and Others</h3>
<p>— Reply to Zhang Dingzhu of the Qingdao Municipal Middle School Horse Team</p>
<p>Brother Dingxun:</p>
<p>The questions you raise are indeed very interesting. When we were team members before, we also paid attention to this as you do. Because we were able to use our markings appropriately, everyone in our team felt as close to their small team as they did to their own family:</p>
<p>You said: "The application of small team markings and the promotion of small team spirit are greatly related." This sentence is absolutely correct. As for the application of small team markings, it is best designed by all your team members, which is more meaningful; here we offer some suggestions for your reference.</p>
<p>Take your own small team as an example. Since you are members of the horse team, you should always show in your life that you are a member of the horse team. Therefore, we believe that in addition to the legally required horse belt shoulder straps and horse team flag, you should collect more other materials:</p>
<p>"" This is the sound of a horse neighing, of course, every member of your team has already learned it. But it is useless if you don't use it, so we hope you will often use this team sound. For example, when gathering, the team leader may use the horse's voice to summon, and each team member can also respond with the horse's voice and gather immediately, which is very meaningful.</p>
<p>We use the team color to indicate our team distinction, but others will not fully understand. If you all carve a horse's head out of cow bones and put it on your scarf, wouldn't it be beautiful and easy to distinguish? Some foreign Boy Scouts also use velvet painted with the team shape and worn on the right arm!</p>
<p>We think you may wish to learn from the Yuan Teng ethnic group and design and carve a totem pole, erected in the regimental headquarters' camp or on the playground. In the future, if there is anything important in your team, you can also record it briefly on it. When you like, you can also sing around the totem pole.</p>
<p>If you think the Yuan Teng pole is too heavy and bulky, you might as well have a memorial staff. On the staff, you can also draw many horse shapes in the same way, and at the same time, you can record many memorable things or ask elders related to you to sign on the staff. In addition, you can engrave or paint horse patterns on your tents, camp flags, military sticks, storage boxes, and various utensils.</p>
<p>In your singing, cheers, and games, you may also wish to inject some of the meaning of "horse." If there is a horse team song, two or three horse team cheers, and one or two specially made "horse" games! This will surely add a lot of color to your horse team.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there is one more thing you should pay special attention to, that is, to show that you are a member of the horse team in spirit. That is to say, you must fully express the spirit of the "horse": "loyalty, honesty, diligence," "hard work and endurance," "bearing heavy responsibilities and achieving transportation" are all the advantages of the horse! Haven't the Boy Scouts in the stable already possessed the spirit of the horse?</p>
<p>Brother, please work hard! Your friendly team will surely truly follow your "horse" head. We hope to receive your report in the near future. Please, I wish you the spirit of a dragon horse!</p>

<h3>The Righteous Dog's Biography (Twenty-Four)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Mrs. Coggleshall and little Eloise were both surprised and delighted, at a loss for words for a moment. Partridge was both angry and anxious, slamming desperately against the iron-clad oak door. They dared not open the door to let him out, and used all sorts of methods to comfort him. They went to get sweet cakes and gravy to feed him, and led him to the fireplace to warm himself, but nothing worked. Partridge refused all consolation and preferential treatment, and would not leave the closed door a step.</p>
<p>It was about six o'clock when the miller Coggleshall walked in dejectedly from a small door opposite, his face pale and his voice trembling, and said to his wife, "This money is lost forever. We searched everywhere with lamps, but there was nothing. All our cash and our daughter's future dowry are gone!" Mrs. Coggleshall hurriedly placed the money in his hands and told him how the money had been returned. Coggleshall slumped into a chair, covering his face with his hands, filled with shame and remorse. Finally, he muttered, "I treated that child too badly. I shouldn't have accepted his kindness."</p>
<p>Little Eloise plucked up her courage, walked up to her father, pressed her loose hair against his face, and whispered, "Father, Nanluo may get it back. Maybe he will come tomorrow morning." Coggleshall hugged her in his arms, his face terribly pale, the corners of his mouth trembling constantly, and replied, "Of course, of course, he will get it back. He can stay here on Christmas Day, even live here permanently. I was confused for a moment and committed a sin, and God has punished me. May God help me, I will make amends to that child for everything - I must make amends for everything."</p>
<p>Little Eloise gratefully and happily kissed her father, then jumped off his lap and went to where Partridge was pawing, waving her hands and feet and saying, "Tonight I'm going to treat Partridge to a good meal."</p>
<p>Her father nodded solemnly and said, "Good, give this dog the best things to eat." It turned out that the old man was deeply moved since recovering the lost money.</p>
<p>This night was Christmas Eve, and the mill was decorated with flowers and extremely magnificent, with many winter green wreaths hanging on the oak spears. Among the large pile of scarlet Nandina bamboo stalks, there was a statue of Jesus nailed to the cross and a large clock surrounded by azaleas, and the surrounding area was filled with colorful paper lanterns and various toys exclusively for little Eloise to play with. As for the food, there was cheese and honey, fish, meat and bread, and candy wrapped in colored paper, everything. Every corner of the room was filled with light and warmth. Little Eloise was prepared to invite Partridge to sit here as a guest and participate in the grand banquet.</p>

<h3>Words to Gonorrhea Sufferers</h3>
<p>— (Shaotang)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea sufferers, also known as white turbidity in common parlance. Its toxicity is as fierce as a flood or a wild beast. If not treated in time, its changing power is extremely rapid, for example, from acute to chronic, from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra, and then invading the rectum, causing rectal gonorrhea. It can also be complicated by epididymitis, urethral stricture, prostatitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, spermatic cord inflammation, etc. The occurrence of this disease is due to the invasion of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The symptoms at the beginning are burning sensation at the urethral opening or difficulty in urination. As the disease progresses, the urethra suppurates and urination is extremely painful. This is the initial symptom of acute gonorrhea. If it is prolonged and not treated, it will become chronic. Therefore, chronic gonorrhea is all transformed from prolonged acute gonorrhea. There is a yellow viscous substance in the urine when urinating, mixed in the urethra. In the early morning, the urethral opening is stuck with pus, resulting in difficult and painful urination. If the gonorrhea toxin is limited to the anterior part of the urethra, it is anterior urethral gonorrhea. If it also invades the posterior part of the urethra, it is complicated by posterior urethral gonorrhea. Epididymitis is characterized by swelling of one side of the testicle. Acute cases can even cause chills and fever. From then on, it is impossible to conceive. Urethral stricture is caused by swelling of the urethra. Therefore, when urinating, it often perforates the outside of the penis or around the anus. Prostatitis is characterized by swelling of the perineum, with hard nodules as large as chestnuts or as large as chicken eggs. Bowel movements are painful, and even suppurate, which is very dangerous. Arthritis is caused by gonorrhea toxin invading the joints of the whole body. The hands and feet are painful and cannot be extended, and may even become disabled. Seminal vesiculitis and spermatic cord inflammation are caused by gonorrhea toxin entering the seminal vesicles through the vas deferens. The symptoms are back pain, often nocturnal emission, or blood mixed in the sperm. Further progression can lead to spermatic cord inflammation, and then the thighs also ache. In general, gonorrhea has many changes. Anyone who suffers from it should seek treatment as soon as it occurs, without any hesitation. The Fuzi Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city specializes in treating this disease and can have rapid results. However, for patients who have economic concerns, or time and work constraints, or who live far away and find it inconvenient to seek medical treatment, there are still methods of self-treatment. For example, "Gonado Denden" is a good medicine for treating gonorrhea. Clinical experience by doctors has proven its effectiveness time and time again. Therefore, we dare to provide a faithful introduction to patients. This medicine is in pill form and sells for two yuan per box. It is sold by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Miraculous Effect of Ganlu in Treating Ringworm</h3>
<p>— (Yunzhong)</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many kinds of skin disease medicines sold on the market. It is impossible to list them all. After examining their ingredients, some contain toxic substances such as creolin and robin. If used carelessly, they are absorbed into the body through the skin, pass through the kidneys, and are excreted from the body in the urine. Therefore, there is often a risk of causing nephritis and proteinuria, which is the opposite of the desired purpose of the patients. I have used "Ganlu" to treat skin diseases for others. Mild cases are cured with one application. The most severe cases require no more than three or four bottles. There has never been any side effects. "Ganlu" is a special medicine for skin diseases that has been sold for a long time by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai. It is made with a special chemical method and is a holy medicine for treating stubborn ringworm, psoriasis, tinea capitis, scabies, lupus, prurigo, impetigo, sitting sores, tinea versicolor, vitiligo, bromhidrosis, eczema and all skin diseases. It is completely free of toxic substances, has a very fragrant taste, and does not stain clothes. A few minutes after application, it can kill insects and stop itching. At the same time, it penetrates the tissues, stimulates white blood cells, and fuses the blood in the affected area to remove the damaged tissues and promote new cell growth. Regardless of how large the affected area is, it only acts on the skin of the affected area and has no effect on healthy skin. Even with continuous treatment, it does not cause dermatitis, nephritis, proteinuria, etc. It is peaceful in nature and extremely effective. Therefore, I dare to introduce it happily. It is said that the selling price of "Ganlu" is only one yuan per bottle.</p>
<h3>Attention Should Be Paid to Stomach Problems</h3>
<p>— Xianxia</p>
<p>It is better to prevent disease than to cure disease. The way to prevent disease lies in moderation in drinking and eating. The weak or elderly should pay more attention. However, it is often seen that people in society often overeat and like strong tea, cigarettes and alcohol, which dilute the gastric juice and irritate the gastric wall. Food is not digested and stagnates in the stomach and intestines, thus causing indigestion, stomach pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, belching and other symptoms, which are extremely harmful and painful. As for failing to prevent beforehand and suffering from various stomach diseases, the only thing to do is to actively treat them and prescribe reliable medicines, so as not to endanger the body and cause other diseases.</p>
<h3>Wei Bi Ling is the Most Reliable for Treating Stomach Diseases</h3>
<p>Wei Bi Ling is the most reliable medicine for treating stomach diseases today. It is effective for all the above-mentioned symptoms and is truly a good medicine. The price is one yuan per box. It is sold by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— (Boming)</p>
<p>Semen is of great importance to the human body. When semen is exhausted, all kinds of diseases arise, which is reasonable. However, observing the young people in the world, they often live alone and unmarried when the spring mechanism is activated, and are lonely and unhappy. They often resort to masturbation to enjoy their illicit pleasure. Again and again. As the days go by, it becomes a habit, and eventually the semen dries up, the body wastes away, and all kinds of diseases arise. Neurasthenia, blurred vision, tinnitus, heaviness in the head, dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, emotional instability, frequent anger, aversion to work, and inability to work, and the reproductive organs are also harmed. The sperm gate is not firm. Nocturnal emission, impotence, and premature ejaculation follow. In short, the origin of neurasthenia is due to nocturnal emission, and the cause of nocturnal emission is masturbation. These two are mutually cause and effect and closely related. Those who suffer from this should seek medical treatment as soon as possible to find a fundamental solution. The simplest and most effective self-treatment method is to take "Xirukang" tablets. This medicine is issued by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession of Shanghai. The price is two yuan per bottle and it has special effects on treating neurasthenia and nocturnal emission. At the same time, patients should also restrain themselves and cultivate their body and mind, and they will soon regain their health.</p>
<h3>Effective Treatment for Freckles</h3>
<p>(Letter from Ms. Sha Meiyin, Ningjin, Hebei)</p>
<p>I have suffered from freckles since I was young, which has been a burden on my lifelong beauty. I can't help but regret this often. The year before last, when my husband was working in Tianjin, he sought treatment from a foreign doctor, but he said that it could not be cured, which made me despair. However, my desire for treatment has not completely given up. At the beginning of this year, my husband was again working in Shanghai. When he came back, he took out two bottles of "Mianli" cream from his suitcase and gave them to me. He said, "This is a beauty cream that treats spots and pimples. It is not only popular in Shanghai, but almost everywhere in the country. Why don't you try it?" I accepted it happily and applied it for a month. The freckles that had been incurable for more than ten years had faded by 70-80%. Later, I continued to buy a bottle from Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession of Shanghai, and it completely removed the remaining spots. The power of this "Mianli" is really not small. My husband once mentioned to me that this kind of text is often published in your magazine and asked me to write one and submit it as a small way to show my gratitude. Therefore, despite my poor writing skills, I wrote this article.</p>
<h3>Female Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Zhenping)</p>
<p>Female gonorrhea is mostly transmitted by men. Men who go whoring contract gonorrhea and secretly do not seek treatment, or the treatment is not complete, which will inevitably be transmitted to their wives. In mild cases, it is nothing more than vaginitis and urethritis, and gonococcal cervicitis. In severe cases, it extends to the uterine cavity, fallopian tubes, ovaries and recurrent pancreas, causing severe inflammation, with acute and chronic phases. The symptoms are a particularly increased amount of white mucus secretions, internal swelling and tenderness, and pain in the small pelvis and sacrum. The whole body is malnourished, and the nervous system is greatly affected. If left untreated, fertility will inevitably be hopeless. Moreover, if a man suffers from gonorrhea and his wife has been infected, even if he is cured alone, he will inevitably be re-infected by his wife. Therefore, they transmit to each other, causing incalculable harm. Therefore, post-event treatment must not be neglected and delayed. The easiest and fastest way to treat and eradicate the disease is to take "Neifu Baidai Wan" and "Waifu Baidai Yao" at the same time. This combination of internal and external treatment is the most effective and can permanently avoid all kinds of complications. Each of the two medicines sells for two yuan and is exclusively sold by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fadama Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>甘露愈我頸癬</h3>
<p>— From Xie Yulin of Yuanhu</p>
<p>Two years ago, I developed several patches resembling ringworm on my neck, causing unbearable itching. It started as a small, round spot, slightly larger than a lentil, but gradually expanded and the itching intensified. The surface was covered with silvery-white scales, and removing them revealed traces of blood. The condition was bearable in cold weather, but during the warmer spring months, the itching became unbearable. I consulted doctors who diagnosed it as ringworm caused by uncleanliness. However, multiple treatments proved ineffective. I then wrote to the editor of a medical journal's special column for advice. He recommended using "Ganlu Lotion." I purchased a bottle from Shanghai Tongren Western Pharmacy and, upon trying it, found it remarkably effective. Within a week, the ringworm began to fade and eventually disappeared completely. I am deeply grateful to the editor and especially to "Ganlu." Such an effective remedy should be known to the public, hence this detailed account. Hopefully, the editor will agree to publish it.</p>
<h3>面麗治愈面皰二例</h3>
<h3>Two Cases of Mian Li Curing Acne</h3>
<p>（一）本埠李景槐來函鄙人患面皰症達牛載餘。面部纍纍然有增無减。靑年人潔白之面孔。幾一變而如柚皮狀矣。不特交際塲中。有失雅儀。卽自顧亦覺難看。上月。敝戚有在海州者。來信託買一美容品曰『面麗』。據云係專治雀斑面皰。余不覺為之心動。遂順便亦購得一瓶。搽之數日。面皰果見隱退。又數日而全治。此實鄙人半年來所想不到也。厥後得海州舍親來書。亦云已將其面皰治愈。是則『面麗』之功效。洵非偶然者矣。</p>
<p>(1) From Li Jinghuai of this city: "I have suffered from acne for over a year. My face is covered with blemishes that only increase. A young man's fair complexion has almost turned into a grapefruit peel. Not only is it unsightly in social situations, but I also find it unpleasant to look at myself. Last month, a relative in Haizhou asked me to buy a beauty product called 'Mian Li,' said to specialize in treating freckles and acne. I was moved by this and purchased a bottle for myself. After applying it for a few days, the acne indeed began to recede, and after a few more days, it was completely cured. This was something I had not expected in the past half-year. Later, I received a letter from my relative in Haizhou, who also said that their acne had been cured. Therefore, the effectiveness of 'Mian Li' is certainly not accidental."</p>
<p>（二）鄞縣姚樹平來函　僕年十八。去歲面部忽發生許多瘰粒。兩頰額上允甚。初色紅。漸變黑。若擠破之。內有白色蟲樣之脂塊。開家人云。此乃發育時期所生之長瘰。但又有云係酒刺者。後讀報。始知乃屬面皰症。曾用諸法治療。率皆無效。最近得某醫師介紹。囑用『面麗』治之。於是滙欵向上海局仁西藥社購該品二瓶。速續塗搽的一旬。皰瘰已十去八九。可謂價廉效偉。素知貴刋然心介紹實騐新藥。爰亦錄此。以供大衆採擇。（面麗。藥房均售）</p>
<p>(2) From Yao Shuping of Yin County: "I am eighteen years old. Last year, many lumps suddenly appeared on my face, especially on my cheeks and forehead. They were initially red and gradually turned black. When squeezed, they released a white, worm-like fatty substance. My family said they were skin eruptions due to puberty, while others said they were pimples. Later, after reading the newspaper, I realized it was acne. I tried various treatments, all of which were ineffective. Recently, a doctor recommended using 'Mian Li.' I sent money to Shanghai Juren Western Pharmacy and purchased two bottles of the product. After applying it continuously for ten days, eight or nine out of ten pimples had disappeared. It can be said to be cheap and effective. Knowing that your publication is dedicated to introducing effective new medicines, I have recorded this for the public's consideration. ('Mian Li' is sold in all pharmacies.)"</p>
<h3>介紹疥癬濕氣藥</h3>
<h3>Introducing Medicines for Scabies, Ringworm and Dampness</h3>
<p>— （濟羣）</p>
<p>— (Ji Qun)</p>
<p>Medicines for scabies, ringworm and dampness flood the market, numbering in the hundreds. No wonder patients suffer from not knowing which to choose. I am not talented, but I dare to introduce what I know to patients. I hope it will be welcomed by readers. Shanghai Tongren Western Pharmacy's "Ganlu" is a special medicine for skin diseases, scabies, ringworm and dampness. The raw materials are excellent, the color is clear, and the scent is fragrant. It does not cause stinging when applied. It is truly outstanding among scabies medicines. It is important to know that medicines have chemical actions, solubility, heat points, and storage capacity. Each medicine has its own properties, so pharmacists must understand them thoroughly before compounding. Otherwise, it is like a blind man riding a blind horse in the middle of the night into a deep pond – not only is it useless, but it is also harmful. Therefore, patients must not be careless when choosing medicines. (Ganlu Lotion is sold in all major pharmacies.)</p>
<h3>胃必靈屢試皆騐</h3>
<h3>Wei Bi Ling has been Proven Effective Repeatedly</h3>
<p>— （馮啓東來稿）</p>
<p>— (Manuscript from Feng Qidong)</p>
<p>Although the words "Wei Bi Ling" are often seen in newspapers, I didn't know how effective it was. I imagined that others who had not tried it would have the same feeling. At the end of last year, my grandmother suddenly suffered a stomachache. Although she had this old ailment before, it had not occurred in three or four years and she was caught off guard. I happened to think of "Wei Bi Ling" and immediately sent a servant to buy a box. Within minutes of taking it, her pain subsided. Although she experienced pain again once, she has not had an attack since after taking it a few more times. During the New Year, my sister-in-law, being pregnant, experienced a significant loss of appetite and vomited after eating even a little. Others said it was morning sickness, but I suggested trying "Wei Bi Ling." My mother strongly opposed her taking the medicine since she was pregnant. However, my sister-in-law said that pregnant women are not prohibited from taking the medicine, so she would try it. Unexpectedly, it worked. Therefore, I have great faith in this medicine. Whenever I feel discomfort in my chest or experience bloating and acid reflux, I turn to "Wei Bi Ling." Such an effective medicine that has been proven repeatedly should be known to everyone.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Truthful Report of "Ama Performance" and "Machine Testing"</h3>
<p>— By a Newspaper Reporter</p>
<p>After those antiques, which we consider valuable but are actually useless, returned home safely, we also participated in two noteworthy exhibitions. One was the "Chinese Cultural Relics Exhibition," which contained the painful history of the nation, and the other was the "Japanese Machine Testing Expo," which covered more than ten acres and displayed hundreds of machines, enough to show Japan's heavy industry surpassing Europe and the United States. The authorities hosting the expo also knew that dry machine testing might not be enough to attract the Chinese audience, so they also published large-scale, suggestive advertisements in Chinese newspapers: "Naked Japanese Mermaid - Ama Underwater Skills... Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity, Don't Miss It."</p>
<p>On North Sichuan Road, in the so-called "Mysterious Street," besides the "January 28th" incident, this could be considered a sensational event in Shanghai. As a reporter, I naturally took the lead and visited the expo. Arriving at the south end of Heng Hong Bridge, I could see the temporarily built venue from afar. Its shape was very much like a large cinema, with a tall gate tower in the middle and two smaller gates on each side, but only the middle gate was used for entry and exit. On the high wall outside the gate, the name of the expo was marked in Chinese on the right and in English on the left, which could be seen from a distance. The admission ticket was initially four cents, but was reduced to two cents for adults and one cent for children. Upon entering the main gate, I immediately saw two large Chinese-style red congratulatory banners hanging high: one was sent by the mayor of the city, Wu Tiecheng, with the four golden characters "Unveiling Academic Knowledge" in the middle; the other was sent by the city councilor Wang Changchun, with the five golden characters "Human Ingenuity Surpasses Nature" in the middle. In the center of this hall-like room, there was a model of an electric locomotive, passenger car, and signaling device from the Japanese Railway Ministry Museum. It was a large circular base made of wood, painted to resemble the railway foundation and terrain, with a small-scale railway laid on top. The electric locomotive pulled the passenger car along the railway. Electric poles were erected beside the railway, one every three or four feet, and red and green signal lights were installed every two poles. However, it was not managed by anyone. When the train approached a pole with a signal light, the red and green lights would automatically turn on and off. This indicated that there was no need for traffic police or barriers at each intersection, allowing pedestrians to stand and wait for the train to pass. Furthermore, the signal lights were accompanied by a ringing sound when they turned on and off, which could alert people even more. It is said that this is in preparation for improving the railway into a streamlined steam locomotive.</p>
<p>To the north of this model was a model of a ship from Dalian Steamship Co. The three letters DKK on it caught my eye, reminding me of the propaganda of the Japanese NYK Shipping Company: "Wherever the sun shines, there will be NYK flags flying!"</p>
<p>From here, a long corridor extended south, with a pedestrian walkway in the middle and industrial and commercial exhibits on both sides. The first part was called Area A, which included Japanese and Chinese typewriters, typesetting machines, steel rails made by the Japan Iron &amp; Steel Co., various electrical machines from Hitachi, hot ironing machines and water boilers from Yamase Iron Works, as well as water heaters, record players, textile machine parts, building materials, railway chain manufacturing machines, mobile cranes, light bulbs and electric fans, motors, etc., all made by Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>The second part, which turned west from the end of the first part, was called Area B. At the beginning was an automatic weaving machine, operated by a Chinese female worker. The crowd was extremely dense. Suzuki-style wool, cotton, and rayon weaving machines were also operated on-site by two Chinese female workers, weaving various plaid fabrics and rayon clothing materials for people to observe. The well-known printing company, Horii Copying Hall, displayed improved stencils and tested their new rotary stencil duplicator on-site. It was electrically powered and automatic, capable of printing up to 100 extremely clear prints per minute at its fastest speed, and at least 40 prints per minute. If special wax paper was used, it could even be typed on with a typewriter and printed, making it no different from typesetting with lead type. Next was Idemitsu Shokai's lubricating oil and mineral oil; Showa Works' lathes and electric drilling machines; and Washino Shokai's high-speed electric metal cutting saws (which could cut metals such as steel bars), portable electric blowers, planers, and weighing scales. Beside them were Rokko-style colored (green, yellow, ochre) roofing tiles. Then there were the paints, baking finishes, steel bars, steel wire ropes, adhesive tapes, spiral spring plates, bearing plates, fire extinguishers, sprayers, grinding wheels (for sharpening knives and files), saw blades, copper wire mesh, and rubber products distributed by Longji. Among them, the Washino air compressor and the Nara-style free pulverizer were the most interesting, and the crowd was large during testing. Air compression made people realize the importance of the air we usually take for granted. The pulverizer could grind all materials into 97% of the powder, the smallest being 0.3 millimeters, which could pass through the small holes of a steel sieve made of Yamase Gulin soft steel plate. The fineness of these holes was almost invisible to the naked eye and could not be felt by hand, as if there were no holes.</p>
<p>There was also a novel and amazing optical guard network, which was truly an ingenious creation of the 20th century. This optical instrument used infrared photography and looked like a camera. The camera, the alarm bell, and a special flash were integrated. If a silhouette passed through the range that the light receiver could capture, the alarm bell would immediately ring, and the flash would start flashing. This meant that if you installed such a machine in a place where you needed to pass through in your house, then the robbers and thieves that exist in the real world would not be able to sneak into your house. The installation of this machine has now been completed by the Japanese Tokyo Electric Co., Ltd. and named "Alarm Device," divided into short-range, long-range, and medium-range types. The short-range type is divided into five meters (approximately sixteen feet) and one hundred meters; the medium-range type is divided into three hundred meters and six hundred meters; and the long-range type has only one thousand two hundred meters. It can be installed in courtyards, gardens, trees, tall buildings, rockeries, etc. It uses electricity overnight and costs only more than two yuan per month (equivalent to 1.80 US dollars). The machine was tested on-site by the exhibition managers. As long as you stood opposite the device, you would hear the alarm ringing loudly and the flash flashing. It was truly amazing and astonishing.</p>
<p>The third part was called Area C, which displayed working machines, most of which were prime movers (main machines), such as the fine textile machines manufactured by Toyota, which were used by well-known Japanese textile factories in Shanghai such as Toyota, etc. Other machines included heavy industry prime movers from Osaka Wakayama Iron Works, which were sold to advanced countries such as Britain and the United States. Hasegawa Ice Machine and Refrigeration Equipment Iron Works displayed a vacuum perspective electric refrigerator, explaining that the glass layer of this refrigerator was completely vacuum, making it not only beautiful, but also allowing one to freely view the food inside. There was also an ice maker that was tested on-site. A one-horsepower machine could produce 5,000 ice popsicles (with sugar, juice, and small bamboo sticks) per day and night; a two-horsepower machine could produce 10,000. These ice popsicles were also sold at the venue for three cents each, and they were quite cool and refreshing.</p>
<p>In addition, Ishikawa Island Shipyard's large-scale heavy industry self-made machines were displayed in photographs. There were many items, too numerous to mention. Tamaya-style surveying, mapping, and meteorological observation instruments were also of high quality, such as focal point inspection mirrors, small theodolites, improved level instruments, nautical direction finders, flat ground positioning instruments, pocket measuring instruments, ground pole surveying instruments, and calibration rulers. There was also a finger-spinning machine, grinding stones, and insulator filters.</p>
<p>The fourth part was called Area D, which was the last exhibition area of the venue. First was the Nissan Automobile exhibition area, with many Datson passenger cars and trucks. The raw materials and parts were all domestically produced in Japan, such as the Hanshin Diesel engine, Japanese batteries, Matsubara Iron Works chains, Japanese National Roll and Coplin, and Japanese Piston Ring Co., Ltd. automobile parts. The Diesel engine buses made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which could seat twenty people, were the latest streamlined models from 1936. The paint was exquisite and beautiful, and the interior decoration was luxurious, which could definitely compete with European and American products. Next was the Diesel engine generator made by Kubota Iron Works, the Ministry of Agriculture's improved water-drawing motor and agricultural implements. The Sanwa Diesel engine prime mover was mainly used in ships, and Japanese power plants, ice factories, textile factories, and flour mills all used it in large quantities, so they did not have to rely on foreign merchants. There was also the aircraft hangar manufactured by the Japanese Pakistan Iron Works, managed by Mitsui Bussan, and the Nogami automatic weaving machine and Kubota tap water iron pipes, which were all special inventions and products.</p>
<p>From the exit of the venue corridor, I arrived at a rectangular atrium, where I saw many stalls set up along the outside of the corridor, all selling Japanese small handicrafts and miscellaneous products: such as cosmetics, ties, imitation ivory toys, jewelry inlaid with special treasures, deerskin bags, lacquered cloth bags, coffee, and copper vegetable peelers. There were small merchants on-site explaining and demonstrating how to use them. However, our country also has many common products of this type, so I will not describe them in detail here.</p>
<p>Finally, I spent another two cents and excitedly entered the tempting "Ama Performance Hall." It was a temporary small theater-like structure built with awnings, with black cloth lining the interior. The seats for the audience were long wooden benches. The so-called Ama swimming pool was a large rectangular fish tank-like pool made of large glass, about fifteen or sixteen feet deep. After two people gave a report in Japanese and Chinese, two women jumped down from the top of the pool. However, they were not naked, and they were not wearing swimsuits either. They were wearing white short shirts and red skirts, and their faces were covered with glass masks. They swam back and forth in the water, somersaulting, standing upright, and diving to the bottom to play rock-paper-scissors. Only their hands and feet were bare, but because the water soaked through their clothes, the curves of their full breasts and buttocks were clearly visible. However, many viewers who came with erotic expectations could not help but sigh in disappointment.</p>
<p>Beside the pool was a place selling pearls. In the long counter, wooden basins were filled with mussels, some large, three inches in diameter, and some small, one inch in diameter, with some rectangular ones in the middle. A Japanese man and a Chinese woman were soliciting customers, saying, "Pearls are formed when a grain of sand gets into the mussel's belly and is nurtured by its saliva. Please choose a mussel from the box for two yuan each. If you are lucky, you might get two large pearls from one mussel. Even if you don't get any, you can open another one, so you won't lose anything!" But few people bought them. The counter displayed strings of pearls and individual larger pearls, with values ranging from ten to more than one hundred and eighty yuan. There were also many large and small mussel shells on display, showing how pearls grow in the mussel's belly from one month to several years. Looking closely, I found it quite interesting. This tour made me admire the Japanese people's efforts in industrial and commercial operations, and their success in attracting customers. But it also revealed many mysterious business tactics and the weak and declining purchasing power of most people in today's society.</p>

<h3>Soviet and Other Countries' Electricity Policies</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Lin</p>
<p>The complete electrification era will undoubtedly only arrive after capitalism becomes a matter of historical record; because the anarchic state of capitalist production hinders the development of productive forces to a higher stage, making it impossible for mankind to fully utilize electrical capabilities. However, the fact that most countries in the world, especially the major advanced countries, have already reached a stage of partial electrification cannot and should not be denied. If the use of electricity is the highest stage of development of production power, then the development of electrical industries in various countries can reflect their economic conditions; and the investigation of their electricity policies can further help us understand the trends of their economic development.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the United States is the country where capitalism has developed to its highest stage, and therefore its electricity development is higher in degree than that of other capitalist countries. According to the statistics of 1934, the total power generation in the United States, combining thermal and hydro power, was 90.91 million KW.H; the total consumption was 70.820 million KW.H, of which general industry consumed 51.2 percent, transportation consumed 7.1 percent, and agriculture and others consumed 40.7 percent. This total number is larger than that of other capitalist countries. As for the controllers of electricity, it is not the state, but a small number of large capital groups; 94.31 percent of the entire American electrical industry is under the control of four large capital groups.</p>
<p>In the past, the American government had always adopted a laissez-faire policy towards the electrical industry. However, with the development of the economic crisis, this capitalist kingdom had to adopt intervention policies towards general economic life, and thus the electrical industry was also controlled by the state; this fact was manifested in Roosevelt's so-called New Deal.</p>
<p>Under Roosevelt's so-called New Deal, the state's control of the electrical industry in the United States ostensibly aims to eliminate the previous dominance of capital based on the Public Utility Act, and to control the electrical industry with the interests of consumers as the primary focus; in this way, it attempts to universalize the use of electricity. For this purpose, the US government will spend 40 million US dollars under the ten-year plan for rural electrification. However, in reality, this control of the electrical industry is only a measure to overcome artificial panic, and to support monopoly capital.</p>
<p>Next is Germany, which is a capitalist heavy industry country, and its electrical industry has always been relatively developed. In 1933, its total power generation, combining hydro and thermal power, was 25.622 million KW.H; consumption was 22.770 million KW.H, of which general industry consumed 79.5 percent, transportation consumed 6.4 percent, agriculture consumed 2.0 percent, and others consumed 12.1 percent. This total number is only smaller than that of the United States among other capitalist countries in the same period; this number has certainly become larger in the recent two years, because in recent years Germany has been desperately developing military industry, expanding armaments, and striving to prepare for war, and the electricity it needs will undoubtedly be more.</p>
<p>Historically, Germany's electrical industry has included state-owned, state-run, city-run, village-run, and privately-run entities; but with the development of German capitalism, many small businesses have gradually been annexed by large capital; therefore, Germany's electrical industry is also controlled by a small number of capital groups. At the same time, the electricity policy implemented by Hitler after he came to power is also to support a small number of large capital groups under the government's control of the electrical industry; this policy was established by the "Power Economy Law" decided on December 13, 1935.</p>
<p>Among capitalist countries, the development of the electrical industry in France is certainly also worth noting. However, strictly speaking, France does not yet have a concrete national electricity policy; it only has partial water law, and laws regarding power transmission organizations; and these are not as obvious as the US government's policy of interfering in the electrical industry.</p>
<p>France's main electrical industry is thermal power generation. Its power generation resources are the coal produced in the north. As for hydropower, it is stored in three areas: the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Central Highlands, with a power generation capacity of five million kilowatts. In the 1933 fiscal year, France's power generation status, based on thermal power, was 8.31 billion kilowatt hours, hydropower was 6.55 billion kilowatt hours, and imports (mainly from Switzerland) were 445 million kilowatt hours, totaling 15.305 billion kilowatt hours; among these, thermal power generation accounted for slightly more than 54 percent. As for the consumption situation, general use accounted for 7.415 billion kilowatt hours, coal mining accounted for 1.43 billion kilowatt hours, iron and steel industry accounted for 1.075 billion kilowatt hours, electro-chemical industry accounted for 2.015 billion kilowatt hours, and transportation industry accounted for 875 million kilowatt hours.</p>
<p>Regarding the spirit of France's main regulations on electricity, we can briefly describe them as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Hydropower Law promulgated in October 1919 stipulates: "Hydropower is an important national resource, and its development and utilization should not be monopolized by private individuals." Therefore, the development of hydropower must require a national license. The main conditions of this license are that a portion of the developed electricity has the obligation to provide public use, and that after the 75-year license period, it will be returned to the state without compensation.</p>
<p>2.  Laws regarding power transmission and connecting power transmission lines were promulgated on July 19, 1922, and April 23, 1923, but these laws cannot be said to be the state's entire concrete electricity policy, and certainly cannot be said to be the state's control of the electrical industry.</p>
<p>Until now, France's electrical industry is still operated through mutual agreements between private business operators. To explain this phenomenon, it is necessary to examine in detail the economic situation in France after the war, but this is not the task of this article.</p>
<p>In addition, in capitalist countries, both Britain and Japan have adopted control policies for the electrical industry. But these policies are also the same in that they help large capital groups, allowing monopoly industries to move forward. For example, in Japan, the state has expressly guaranteed the monopoly of the supply area for electrical businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, it is necessary to talk about the Soviet Union's efforts in electrification. We have already pointed out at the beginning of this article that capitalist countries cannot be completely electrified due to the anarchic state of production. However, the Soviet Union's new planned economy does not have this problem, and therefore its electrification speed is very astonishing.</p>
<p>The creator of the Soviet Union, Ilyich, believed that electrification was their "second party program," and said that nationwide electrification was a major content of their doctrine. Therefore, the Soviet people worked especially hard on electrification, and the achievements they have made are especially remarkable. The fact is that during the period of the great economic panic in the capitalist world, the development of the Soviet Union's electrification numbers showed the following astonishing state:</p>
<p>(The above is the percentage of the previous year)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the concrete achievements shown in the Soviet Union's economic construction are the completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the commencement of the Second Five-Year Plan. In the middle of this, the achievements in electrification also showed amazing performance. When the First Five-Year Plan was completed, the power generation capacity of the Soviet Union's power plants was 7 million kilowatts, and it will reach 40 to 50 million kilowatts when the Second Five-Year Plan is completed. According to the planned plan, in 1940, the baseline number of electrification in the Soviet Union was 70 to 75 million kilowatts, but in 1930, the power generation capacity of the United States, which had reached the highest point of capitalist development, was only 36.3 million kilowatts; comparing the two, in eight to ten years, the Soviet Union will not only catch up with the United States in power generation capacity, but will also exceed its level by two times.</p>

<h3>Beauty in the Deep Mountains</h3>
<p>— Lianfang</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence</p>
<p>People who have never been to Yunnan always feel a little scared when they mention Yunnan; it seems that the place is very far away, and savage, and has poisonous miasma, and no one has ever dared to go there, and they will die if they go. Therefore, the "Old Man of Xinfeng" in the past would rather pick up a stone and break his arm than follow the team to his death when he heard that the team was going to Yunnan.</p>
<p>This kind of fear and prejudice against Yunnan has always been very strong. In fact, how is Yunnan like what they imagined?</p>
<p>Yunnan has its special flavor. In this world full of huge mountains and primitive nature, although it seems a bit wild and tough, there are many places of "picturesque scenery" that you can't imagine. Take Kunming, for example, what kind of place do you think it is? It is a</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>beauty hiding in the deep mountains, who has not yet been discovered. Although she is dressed a bit out of date, it is enough to intoxicate you.</p>
<p>When a traveler drags that tired body and is brought to Kunming alone by the Yunnan-Vietnam train, it will give you sweet warmth, as if it is your long-lost mistress. According to your liking, it will satisfy you in every way.</p>
<p>If you are a worshiper of the city, when you arrive in Kunming, you will not feel that it does not have even a bit of urban atmosphere. Here, there are neat Western-style shops; wide and flat roads; cars, rickshaws, bicycles, constantly coming and going; and people rushing to join the fun are walking so crowded on both sides of the street. The shops on both sides of the road display dazzling goods, and the clear sound of the phonograph is constantly broadcast from the shops with cheap signs, which seems so strangely lively.</p>
<p>From day to night, the place where a crowd of people is always squeezed together is the playground without sorrow. Here, there is a sound movie theater and a silent movie theater, and the theater also has one that sings Beijing opera and one that sings Yunnan opera. In addition to this, there are many small tea gardens that sing bench opera, where you can sit and listen by just brewing a pot of tea.</p>
<p>Luxurious taverns and elegant coffee shops are also available here. It is a pity that there are no waitresses; otherwise, it would be enough for the average playboy to enjoy.</p>
<p>Besides this, when you come to Kunming, you must not fail to visit Xishan, with its secluded forests, and the Golden Temple, where Wu Sangui ascended the dragon throne. The cool and elegant Black Dragon Pool and the Bamboo Temple with many Arhats are also worth playing.</p>
<p>The people of Kunming are born with a talking mouth. When one person meets another, they are polite to the extreme. Even in the same family, they are so rambling and polite, not afraid of embarrassing people. But occasionally, because of a small matter, they will quarrel for an hour or two without stopping.</p>
<p>The climate in Kunming changes very quickly. The weather is very warm during Qingming, but it becomes a bit cold as soon as it rains. Therefore, there is a saying in Kunming: [Four seasons without heat and cold, a rain turns into winter]. I remember a foreigner who traveled to Yunnan said this: When walking on the street in Kunming every day, you must ask a follower to carry all the clothes of the four seasons with you. This is true. But the weather in Kunming is not as cold and hot as in the north. The heat does not exceed 80 degrees at its hottest, and it is not easy to see snow when it is cold in winter. The weather is almost like spring all year round.</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of the Bald</h3>
<p>— Weilie</p>
<p>Who doesn't say that Lili is a beauty, but perhaps Lili was born too beautiful? She was envied by God, and she was given a shiny and bare head, like a calabash shell, and deprived of her cloud-like black hair.</p>
<p>Of course! Lili was not born bald. Although her hair was relatively sparse, her dark hair gently covered the top of her head, which matched her lovable face. It didn't look very sparse, but [the sky has unpredictable storms, and people have unexpected misfortunes]. In the autumn of her eighteenth year, she suffered a very serious typhoid fever, which cost her father a lot of money and shed a lot of tears for her mother. It was not easy to drag her little life back from the gate of hell, but her beautiful bunch of hair was forever hung at the gate of hell and did not want to come back. In this way, Lili became a premature bald woman.</p>
<p>She was so sad, so uncomfortable, suffering all day long, making trouble to find death. She said: [Living in this world is a shameful life, it is better to die cleanly. Can I see people with my appearance? Let's die! Let's die!] But she didn't die after all, and she has lived to this day. Half of this is of course because human beings have a natural disposition to love life and hate death, and the other half is because her father is rich.</p>
<p>When Lili first became bald, her father loved his baby daughter and spared no expense to treat her. What Chinese medicine, Western medicine, beauty salons, plasters, electrotherapy, hair growth tonic, hair growth oil... all kinds of methods were tried, but Lili's bald head became brighter and shinier due to stimulation, while Lili's hair stubbornly refused to grow out.</p>
<p>There was no way to treat the root cause, so she could only treat the symptoms. Therefore, Lili wore a hat on her head regardless of the cold, summer, morning, or evening. She even wore a nightcap like a newborn baby when she slept. But her head was too shiny. Although she wore a hat, she still couldn't cover the bald spots on the back of her neck and next to her ears. The strange appearance of neither male nor female, not to mention that others found it funny, even Lili herself felt very ugly. Finally, legal tender was effective. She spent one hundred yuan to go to the beauty salon to install a wig, but she had to take off the wig at night before going to sleep, because it was easy to damage or fall off the wig while sleeping.</p>
<p>Now Lili is still a beautiful and perfect Lili, because money has made up for her defects. She not only has a head of curly, blue-black, and shiny hair, but also can change the color and style of her hair as she pleases. Today, she wears a cheongsam with a dragon pattern, so she puts on a head of jet-black hair. Tomorrow, she changes into a low-cut Western suit, so she puts on a head of golden and brilliant yellow hair. Under the tilted hat, a bunch of golden silk-like yellow hair is exposed, how beautiful! Although the wig is not as natural as real hair, it is always better than baldness. Especially when wearing a hat and exposing a bunch of hair under the ears, who knows if her hair is real or fake, so Lili has regained her past joy and happiness.</p>
<p>Lili suffered a lot and shed a lot of tears because of her baldness, so she has no good feelings for all bald people. She hates nuns, hates monks, hates bald old people, and even hates newborn babies who have just shaved their heads. Whenever the nun Miaozhen of Lianhua Nunnery came to visit her mother, she always received her very coldly—she used to be very close to her, and often went to her nunnery to play—and often spoke ill of the nun in front of her mother, using very high-sounding words to persuade her mother not to associate with the nun. She didn't want to participate in Buddhist ceremonies and Taoist rituals, because there were too many monks and nuns there. She didn't want a bald old woman to serve her, and she didn't like her little nephew who had just had his head shaved after being a month old. Because they were upright and didn't need to hide their bald heads, giving her a sense of threat, a kind of ridicule, and a kind of shame. She didn't want to see them, and even didn't like to hear everything about them, especially afraid of others mentioning nuns. Her reason was: [Women all have hair. Nuns are the only bald women. She is also bald. Isn't she also a nun?]</p>
<p>Because of her baldness, Lili has been out of school for more than a year. Lili's parents don't care about this. They don't need their daughters to earn money to support them. It's enough to know a few words and be able to write letters! Fortunately, there is a lot of money in the family. Isn't it good to stay at home to accompany the old mother and live a life of enjoyment as a young lady? But Lili, who was used to running around outside, was forced to stay at home for more than a year because of her baldness. She was really bored—how uncomfortable it is for a lively little bird to be locked in a golden cage! She needs to breathe free air, so Lili asked her parents to let her go back to school to study, so she resumed her school life a year ago, because she has now regained her original beauty, she can see people, and the wig has made up for her defects. She is still so cute and so charming. Those who don't know her details, how do they know that this beauty has a bald head like a gourd shell?</p>
<p>[Young men are all prone to love, and young women are all prone to cherish spring]. Our Lili is at a good age, and she has a pretty face and a delicate heart. She knows how to love, she understands the psychology of men, she understands what means can be used to make men obediently bow down under her high heels, and she also knows how to use the pretty face under the bald head to make men fall in love. She wants to adjust her boring and monotonous life, so she always mixes with men in her spare time and holidays to talk, laugh, and play. She is good with Zhang, and she is also good with Li. She loves Wang's pretty boy, and she also loves Chen's Indian black charcoal. She likes Meng's heroic style, she admires Zhang as a writer, and she also worships Wei as an artist. She is not particularly good with anyone, nor is she particularly bad. She does not get close to anyone, nor does she neglect anyone. Everyone is treated equally.</p>
<p>Although Lili likes to talk, laugh, and play with men, she is unwilling to accept anyone's love. When a man is confused by her beauty and liveliness and offers her a red and ardent heart with both hands, she arrogantly ignores him, and even does not hesitate to crush his heart of love heavily. Of course, in this situation, the man is haggard with a crushed and wounded heart. Lili, however, hides alone on the bed and weeps sadly, because she loves him as he loves her, and she is willing to accept his love. But when she thinks of her shiny bald head, she is discouraged and her heart aches. Finally, she sadly rejects his love, because she understands that a bald woman is not worthy of receiving a man's love. The reason why she receives men's ardent love and pursuit is because men do not know that she is a bald woman. She does not believe that a woman as disabled as she is can get a man's eternal love. Moreover, men love her because of her beauty. If they know that she is a bald woman who is ten times uglier than ordinary people, this love built on [beauty] will immediately melt, disintegrate, and disappear like a snowman in the sun. Rather than being abandoned in the future and suffering the pain of being lovelorn, it is better to decide in advance not to accept anyone's love. But she is still willing to talk, laugh, and play with men, and often resolutely rejects the love that men offer her.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, she went to college. After graduating from college, she worked at the ×× bank. She is now twenty-seven years old, but her beauty has not diminished with the growth of age. She still occupies a victory in the love field and can still easily grab the hearts of men. But she is still a single person, a spinster, because her barren bald head that does not grow grass and trees has made her lose the courage to accept any man's love.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Germany's Former Colonies</h3>
<p>— Peng Sheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the unprecedented World War of 1914-1918 was a war between imperialists for markets and colonies; one of the results of this war was that Germany lost many territories and colonies. But Germany has not eliminated its ambition and combat capability because of this. It is preparing to show its power again on the world battlefield. Now, Hitler has raised the issue of recovering colonies or re-dividing world colonies, which makes the crisis of World War II even more urgent.</p>
<p>However, where are Germany's former colonies scattered? What is its situation? Few people have described this in detail, but this is something that everyone who cares about world issues must know.</p>
<p>Before the war, Germany had a total of 1,140,117 square miles of colonies in Africa, Australia, Asia, and other places, with a total population of 13,258,000 people. After the war, due to the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, these colonies were all acquired by countries such as Britain and France. In total, these colonies include Togoland, Cameroon, Southwest Africa, Tanganyika (German East Africa) in Africa: New Guinea (northeast of Papua Island), San Solomon, Caroline, Marshall Islands, Samoa Quasi-Island in Australia; and Jiaozhou Bay in Asia. The various emotions in these places are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Togoland This place has an area of 32,800 square miles, and was declared occupied by Dr. Nahatahal, the German Consul General in West Africa in July 1884. After the war, it was divided into two parts by the Treaty of Versailles: one part belongs to Da Beauty of French West Africa: among them, the area of the territory ruled by the United Kingdom is about 12,600 square miles, with a population of 359,000, and the area ruled by France is about 21,200 square miles, with a population of six</p>
