<p>川省督署所召集之二十五年度軍務會議，於九月二十四日上午九時，在省府聯席辦公室正式開幕。會議期定為二日，二十五日休息一日，二十六日繼被舉行，卽以此為最後會議之一日。因出席人員，均為四川善後督辦公署直轄之重要將領，故省府所在地之督院街，二十四日特加崗戒備，極為森嚴。屆時出席者，計有善後督辦劉湘，陸軍二十一軍軍長唐式遵，二十三軍軍長潘文華，四十四軍軍長王　緒，師長范紹增，楊國楨，饒國華，陳蘭亭，陳　謙，許堯卿，郭助祺等，及所屬各旅長，督署參謀長傳常，副官長梁駿，參謀處長嚴嘯虎，軍務處長徐恩平，秘書處長劉東父，軍理處長閔永濂，軍醫處長趙伯鈞，經理處長唐華，曁省府秘書長鄧鳴階等二百餘人。誠為近兩年來所未有之盛。討論問題分軍需，軍實，軍務，訓練及部隊駐地之分配等項。二十六日會議時，劉督辦並邀請省府設計委員會副委員長宴陽初出席講演。此决會議內容，關防甚嚴，所有與會之各級人員，督署事先卽嚴令不准洩漏，其性質之重要，殆可想見。而與川局前途，自不無相當關係。爰綜合所得各方情形，概述如决。</p>
<p>剿匪吿一結束</p>
<p>川省剿匪軍事，在二十四年上季蔣委員長入川督飭各軍大舉進剿後，卽吿一段落。彼時匪以殘餘之衆，由川西松潘懋功方面取道天蘆竄入西康，圖盤據　隅，恢復實力後，再謀進犯。迨後朱毛，蕭賀兩股，先後入康與徐匪會合，自此西康方面，父成剿匪重心。中央軍及川，滇，各駐軍，相繼入康，重重包團，匪部雖合股，究因抗戰數年，實力大損，且朱毛，蕭賀各匪流竄數省，疲憊不堪，何能與如此大量之官軍扺敵，乃又改變計劃，放棄西康，與陝北徐匪合股，以圖竄入綏寗，打通所謂國際路綫，本年七八月閒，匪遂由康北竄，經川靑邊境入甘，當時川西松懋各地情勢，似甚緊張。但川中各軍，早有嚴密防備，故匪部到後，卽被痛擊，竄人隴南。川剿匪軍事，至此乃吿段洛。惟匪部流竄無定，中央除增調胡宗南全軍人甘協同朱紹良，于學忠等部加緊進剿，以期一鼓聚殲外，並在川省調遣四十一軍孫震及四十五軍鄧錫　兩軍大部前往。二十三，二十四兩日，兩部已分別出動，四十一軍董曾兩師則開甘肅碧口，成都一帶，相機進剿，四十五軍陳師則開駐廣元陽平關，陝西略陽一帶，防匪進竄</p>
<p>目前四大問題</p>
<p>剿匪軍事旣吿一段落，川省今後問題，乃（一）為軍隊之整理，（二）駐地之分配，（三）地方營後，（四）軍費問題。其中允以最後一項為目前所急要解决者。蓋川省軍費經行營核定每年為六千餘萬，自二十五年度起，遂年遞减，難有固定之機關撥發，但因一時籌措困難，各軍軍餉已積至數月未發。任何事業旣均以經濟為先决條件，軍隊當亦不能例外。軍費問題未解决，又遑論從事整理。故此决督署所召開之軍務會議之目的，卽在謀一妥善辦法，俾前項欠餉，陸續開銷，而使將來不致難於籌措。則其他駐地之分配及整理問題，均不難迎刃而解。關於地方善後，第一要着為肅淸土匪，其决為刷新庶政；自匪軍敗退後，當局銳意圖治，年來頗見進展。惟被匪蹂躪區域，元氣已損失無餘，雖經整理，仍未回復原狀；以是難民尙多流落於外，生活所迫，不免有流為盜匪者、且去年川軍一度裁編，被裁士兵，旣無相當職業，亦不免有出於為匪之一途。邇來成渝各地報紙，對於匪之消息，幾無不滿篇皆是，卽此可想見各地匪風之盛，其原因實基於此。雖有綏靖區之劃分，而以不可靠之保安隊擔任淸剿，收效甚徵。省府為肅淸匪氛起見，特於日前成立一四川善後淸鄕委員會，由劉湘主席自兼委員長，鄧錫侯軍長兼任副委員長。劃全省為十一個淸鄕區，成渝萬三市則劃為特別區每區設司令一人，以旅長擔任。在短期內，限令將駐區內所有軍警保安隊聯合組織成淸鄕部隊，擔任淸鄉，以軍民之實力，合而為一，一致為地方淸除匪患，則此後當不復有多大困難。</p>
<p>無故謠言頻起</p>
<p>此决鄧孫兩軍調防陝甘邊境，所遺防地，由何部接替，當局早已派定。為欲保障地方治安能永久維持，關於全川軍隊駐地之分配，勢當另行整個計劃，免地方兵力，有厚薄之分，而能保持均衡狀態，不過川中局勢，每有一極平常之變態，謠言卽隨之而起。如成都事件發生，一般人口中，不謂係某方指使，故意與中央為難，卽謂某方坐視不理，徒使事態擴大，俾於其中獲利。月前廣西異動，謠言亦多，迨大局平定，又不免有人遺謠。或謂中央調劉湘率兵出川駐防某地，或謂某某將調任省主席，更有謂某軍將開入川省駐防，其實川省自去年蔣委員長人川整理後，地方與中央卽已打成一片；中央對川，固無岐視之觀念，而川當局及各軍政領袖，亦均能服從中央。劉主席前派鄧鳴階秘書長飛牯嶺謁蔣，更有明白之表示。中央與川省，何嘗有芥蒂存在其間。劉主席於此决軍務會議中，且發表重要演說，謂川省政治旣人正軌，全川軍隊亦歸統一，此後川省之實力，惟有遵從中央意旨，一致以救亡為目標云云。觀此，川省之局勢，已大體可知。至於鄧孫兩部調動，不過係奉命防剿竄匪，如匪部消滅，仍將調返原防。總之，川局前途，正注意於善後與整軍兩途。一切傳說，殊不足憑。蓋蜀人多謠，前人早已先我言之也。（九月二十五日）</p>

<h3 id="c61">外交努力之最高限度 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>月餘以來。中日兩國間的外交關係。一步步的趨向緊張。到最近一旬中。似已達於最嚴重的階段。這種局勢的造成。表面上是由於兩種原因。第一是在成都北海漢口與上海接連發生的所謂「不幸事件」。日方不以鎭靜態度。調查其根本的原因。而只是推波助瀾。藉以脅迫中國當局。致造成一種意外緊張的局勢。第二是我國張外長與日大使川越在南京進行的談判。由於意見的懸殊。不能順利進展。而路透社所傳日方的無理要求與同盟社所示東京的强硬態度。皆足使中國民衆激忿不安。這兩種情勢。特別是虹口事件發生後日方故意的舖張揚。厲激成一種非常的空氣。使我們感覺到中日關係的「調整」。在外交的途徑上。確已到達千鈞一髮的關頭。</p>
<p>不過。在這樣嚴重的關頭。據日方口頭上的表示。他們還沒有捨棄外交途徑的决意。昨日東京電傳。外務省已派遣東亞局長桑島。携三省會議所决定之具體案。來華傳達於川越大使。準備重開談判。似乎在非常黯淡的現局。中還有「峯迴路轉」的一錢希望。但我們必須指出。我們對於日方這種表示。决不存有非分的幻想。我們固然不會拒絕在外交的途徑上解决中日問題的辦法。但從外交上「調整」兩國的關係。須依循正當的路徑。並須不違背一個獨立國家的基本立塲。離開了這兩點。卽是超越了外交努力的最高限度。我們决不能容忍。我們願趁着目前嚴重的時刻。說明我們對於外交上的幾點意見。</p>
<p>第一。在根本上。我們應該認淸。中日關係的失常。至少在一九三一年「九一八」時候。就已開始。决不是最近的一些事件所促成的。束三省熱河冀東察北這許多地方的被侵佔。淞滬這樣繁盛市區的被轟炸。偽自治運動的進行。武裝走私的猖狂。這些重大的事變。把最近的一些事件比較起來。眞是「不可同日而語」了。賬應該從頭算起。在目前的外交談判中。我們必須把五年來我國領土主權所受的損害。與對方作一整個的淸算。</p>
<p>第二。在五年來中日關係失常的經過中。我們見到日方對於中國。只有武力。沒有外交。假使有的。卽是刺刀下的外交。所以對於淞滬恊定塘沽協定『何梅協定』等等的談判。我們都認為不是在正常外交下進行的。現在日方如果確有誠意就外交的正途進行談判。我們自然應該要求這些協定的撤消。而且以前日方對於我國的許多交涉。常常故意的把地方當局作為對象。不依照外交的常軌進行。在目前日方必欲捨棄與張外長談判的正途。而要求與行政院蔣院長進行所謂『直接的』談判。更可見去年日方一班武官呌囂跋扈的態度。至今還沒有改變。這樣不依外交正軌的手段。也必不能把中日外交關係納入於正途。</p>
<p>第三。這次南京談判中日方所提的要求。路透社曾經根據東京『讀賣新聞』的消息。加以發表。卽是關於華北五省的『自治』中日交通的合同中國對於日貨稅則的再减低及儘量聘用日本顧問等四項的。這四項要求的實質。卽是要把中國完全淪為日本的殖民地。但是在前日。日本外務省的發言人天羽忽然發表一文。攻擊路透社稱這種消息為『幻想的宣傳』。不錯。我們雖然不敢斷定這種要求是否屬實。但敢確言這種要求非但是幻想。而且十足的荒謬。凡是損害中國領土主權的一切要求。都是超過了中日外交努力最高限度的荒謬的『幻想』。</p>
<p>最後。我們還應該坦白表明一下。中國人民對於日本。並不存有何種非分的『幻想』。我們只有一個正當的要求。就是恢復我們的領土和主權。為了保障中國的領士和主權。我們决不怕任何的犧牲。</p>

<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>或曰際茲世界多事，風雲色變之秋，不從事實際工作，乃提倡護生運動，得母有背時勢乎，予日似是而實非也，夫國際間之戰爭，雖有政治上種種之宿因，實由一二讀武者促成其事，無論其禍首為誰，結果其勝利終屬於後方有建設有生產者，可斷言也。保護動物一事，從表面觀之，雖直接無補於現時我國之危局，但賓為人心建設吃緊工作之一種，挽近世風漓薄，道德淪喪，新生活八德之推行，要亦當頭棒喝，唤醒迷夢之舉也。管子曰，哀莫大於心死，一國之弱，縱至極點，苟民心不死，終必可圖，况戰爭為瞬間之變象，建設乃立國萬年之基礎乎？故本會成立至今，瞬已三載，歷年獨排衆議，宗先賢物我胞與，含生並育之旨，懃懃於宣導工作，藉以振起人心之頹廢，幸得各方同情與贊助，會務得日有進展，今歲復舉辦本市各級學校護生文畫之展覽，以期我國固有之仁慈博愛古德，得深深印入兒童之腦海，俾純潔之心版，早留良好之景象，孫總理曰，革命先要革心也，保護動物之意旨如此，安得謂之背時勢也乎？客曰唯唯，予命之矣，爰書此以作特刋卷首語，惟茲事體大，棉力難周，尙有賴海內大雅君子，樂於匡助焉。</p>

<p>駒光如逝，一年一度之世界動物節，瞬已屆期，溯本會自成立以來，迄今已三載有餘，其過去工作，業於前去兩年動物節，擇要報吿，至最近一年間，深荷各界人士，暨各會員之熱心匡助，會務賴以進展，雖因囿於環境，限於經濟，所有關於護生應辦事項，尙未克儘量推行，而倡導宣傳工作，似已有相當之成效，茲謹將過去一年中會務，作簡要之報吿如决。</p>
<p>（一）事業　關於訴請事項，除根據各會員，暨各地入士之報吿，籲請各當地政府，禁止殺食耕牛田鷄，及制止捕殺野犬，殺剝胎羊等項，均逐案分別辦理外，並於四月間呈請立法院，訂立禁止虐待動物條例　最近曾會同上海西入禁止虐待動物會，擬訂禁捕犬類改善待遇簡章，函請本市衛生局核准施行，同時並呈准內政部，今年十月四日動物節通令全國禁屠一日。關於放生事項，凡本埠人士，有送放生動物來會者，均分別為之設法轉送大塲惠生社，暨市立動物園等處留養，本會現正計劃，擬於最近期內，籌建放生園，刻已承吳淞保安寺，允永久租借空地三十五畝，一俟籌有的欵卽可着手興建。</p>
<p>（一）組織　我國幅員遼闊，各地情形，頗多隔閡，欲推行護生事業，恐有鞭長莫及之憾，爰照原定計劃，廣設分會，計現已成立者，有西京（長安）吳縣，南京，長沙等四處，正在籌備者，有如皋，東台，南昌等三處，並於去年動物節，開始徵求會員，以資集思廣益，共策淮行，一年以來，入會新會員，凡二百八十六人。（一）宣傳　挽近人類殘虐之風，已成積重難返之象，是以本會宣傳工作不得不力求普遍，藉以喚起社會人士之注意，特於春間，聘請宣導員八人分赴各地調查，如遇有虐待動物情事，立卽婉言勸阻，並曉以物與民胞，含生並育之義，於夏間復印製護生紙扇萬柄，分贈本埠人士，得各界之熱烈歡迎，紛來索取，不數日而盡，近復製贈護生功德襟章一種，佩於衣襟，頗能引起吾人護生、興趣，亦古賢佩弦豊以自惕之意，茲於本月三日四日，借座市商會，舉行本市各級學校護生文畫展覽會，異使市民得深刻之印象，而廣推好生之義也。</p>
<p>以上所述，均係犖犖大者，至此後應辦事項正多，尙待逐步進行，深望海內仁者，錫以南鍼，助以實力，不勝馨香禱祝之至。</p>

<p>— 范德一</p>
<p>「博愛」是中山先生主義之一，他所主張的「博愛」，固然是指着人類間的互相愛護，孟子亦曾經說過，「人皆有不忍人之心」，又說「無惻隱之心非人也」，所謂「不忍人之心」，和「惻隱之心」，固然亦是指着個人對於同類從內心所發出的情感，可是我們對於一切動物亦都希望牠們活潑潑地生活着，誰都不忍聽他們生病時的呻吟，和垂死時的悲鳴吧，這可證惻隱之心是不僅對於同類而已，可是有些心理反常的人，他們對於人類，並不凶横，對於其他動物，却面目猙獰，手段殘忍了，試觀農夫對於業主俯身聽命，瑟縮畏懼，那副可憐的態度，十足可憐，可是對待帮助工作的牛，却每天呌牠不是耕田便是戽水整日工作，毫無休息的時間，間或為了工作疲乏過度，偶形怠懶，那便鞭笞並加，對於牠的生活上，那更不必談起，柵裏從不加以打掃，食物史不加以調節，怎能不使牠們死亡率增加，而生長率减少呢？</p>
<p>至於馬也是如此，一天到晚的勞動着，身上負着幾百斤的貨物，輸來運去，所得到的報酬，也不過是主人的鞭打，與不適宜的安息處罷了。</p>
<p>鷄鴨是供給人們做食品的，公鷄能够報曉，母鷄能够產卵，對於人類也是有益的，可是有許多人把牠倒提，你試設身處地想想，那時牠們是多麽難受，到了殺的時候，還有人先摘去牠頸上的毛，然後再殺，這太沒有設身處地的心了吧，牠的被殺，也已經够殘忍的，何况在未死之前而要受這種更不人道的罪呢。</p>
<p>狗貓也是家畜一類，我們用牠來保護我們的，因為狗能守門，貓能捕鼠，所以是有益的動物，有些玩童，將狗貓等任意的責打，使牠的皮肉受苦，為的是什麽呢。</p>
<p>我們假使要愛護牠們，使牠們能死亡率减少，我們一定要將牠們的毛常常的洗刷，牠們的臥處要常常打掃，牠們的工作要减少，不使牠們受到皮肉的痛苦，這是「惻隱之心」的眞正表現，和博愛的本意啊!</p>

<h3 id="c133">保護動物的心理建設 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>保護動物在中國現在還是一種剛發軔的運動，護生雖是人類的天性，但是這種天性已日漸泯滅了。孫中山先生說：「革命先要革心」。保護動物的基礎工作，亦就是要革心。在每個人的心理上，建設一道堅固的保護動物陣綫來，那末保護動物的成效，便可以計日而待了。</p>
<p>然則如何可以建立這一道保護動物的心理防線呢？據我的意見，可分四點來說：</p>
<p>（一）人人要有博愛的精神</p>
<p>人類原是博愛的，對於一切的生物都有愛護的熱忱，這種博愛精神的淪落，生物殘殺的日見劇烈，第一個原因，便是人類自私心的作祟。</p>
<p>自私心理是人類劣根性的表顯，為了個人的利益，不惜任何的犧牲，無辜的動物，便遭遇着悲慘的命運了。</p>
<p>我曾看見一個人新買了一枝手槍，把野狗當作槍靶，當那可憐的狗莫明其妙躺在血泊中伸着脚作生命的最後掙扎時，那人却現出驕傲猙獰的微笑了。又會見過一位喜歡養鳥的紳士，不惜把成千成萬的小靑蟲，充作他鳥兒的食料，又有一位家長因一只靑蛙使他的孩子受驚，以後遇到了靑蛙，活活的摔死！……啊！這些那些，眞是舉不勝舉，這些充分是自私心理表演，眞是人類的奇恥大辱；</p>
<p>要尅服這些自私心理，必須人人要有博愛的精神，博愛精神是什麽？便是覺富的同情心。我們固然要愛己，我們也要愛她，我們固然要愛人，我們也要愛物我們要犧牲小己的利益來維護成千成百生命的利益。</p>
<p>（二）人人要有刻苦的精神</p>
<p>保護動物的運動在心理上要打破的第二道難關，便是享樂的心理，「及時行樂」是一個傳統的觀念。無量數的動物又在人們的及時行樂心理下犧牲了生命。</p>
<p>富家大閥不必說，卽是「販夫走卒」，「行車賣漿」者流，今天手頭有了幾塊錢，就得去買半斤肉一尾魚，宰一只鷄，湯了酒，在家裏大喝大嚼起來，興緻一起，也許還要添幾只洋澄湖大紅蟹呢，吃的人「樂呀樂呀」的吃着，他那裏會知道猪的悲鳴，魚的掙扎，鷄的哀啼，以及蟹在熱鍋裏走頭無路的時候是怎樣悲慘的一副情景啊</p>
<p>要尅服這種亨樂的心理，必須人人要有刻苦的精神，蔬菜果然不比魚肉美味，棉絮果然不比狐裘的和暖，豆腐果然不比童鷄汁滋補，……但是為了同是生物界的一分子的生命，我們寗可捨此而就彼，這種物質上的刻苦是有報酬的，那就是精神上的絕大愉快！</p>
<p>（三）人人要有切實的精神</p>
<p>「酒池肉林」，是表示家庭的豪奢的，宴會席上，沒有山珍海錯，不能算是正式的酒筵，有婚事喜事的人家，常常以殺猪羊多少頭，宰鷄鴨多少只，來誇耀他「排塲」的偉大，冬天身上沒有穿狐嵌或是灰鼠皮袍不能算是有綫的人，頭頸裏沒有一張狐狸皮，不能算是貴族的小姐太太，這種社會競尙虛榮的心理一天不革除，那些無辜的生靈就會不停止的被殘忍的人類整批的屠殺……；</p>
<p>要革除這種虛榮的心理，必須每個人有切切實實為動物造福的誠心！大家應該改變向來的態度，用殘殺動物的手段來表示我們的豪華這是可恥的，殘忍的，野蠻的，是人類原始的獸性表現，是不能容於近代文明社會裏的。</p>
<p>（四）人人要有勇收的精神</p>
<p>有些人說：「保誰動物，我很想奉行，可是我一個人力量很小，沒有什麽效果，而且有時候還被人家笑話」。這種「大家這樣做，我就這樣做」的推託話，是十足地惰性的表現，是畏難苟安心理的表現，保護動物要達到成功，這種心理亦必得去除</p>
<p>第一我們要「先從我做起那管人不做」。</p>

<p>總領隊王正廷博士談參加世運感想如下（一）此决吾國遣派選手參加世運會、成績如何、在未出國之前、早已預知、惟所以參加之原因、寳為求取經騐、並以前决洛杉機世運會、吾國僅有一人參加、此决實為第一次之正式加入、深冀因參加而引起全體國人之注意、因吾國歷年全國運動會及數决遠東運動會之成績、雖經各報披載、惟尙不為國人充分之注意、此决參加世運後、因相較之下、强弱懸殊、尙可使國人從而知所奪勉、有所努力、此其一、（二）體育之事業、因須一般民衆之注意、惟允須政府竭力倡導、方能普遍深入，蓋體育為敎育之本、有健全之體格、然後有健全之精神、吾國數千年來、重文輕武、積習已久、此决參加世運之所以失敗、其最大原因、由於體力不足、此點甚望政府敎育當局、予以注意、國民體格與民族前途、俱深利賴、（三）運動之競賽、體力為一事、技術又一事、吾國體力固感不足、技術亦未盡合人意、故如何以科學方式、從事技術之硏究、亦至重要、此决於選派選手之外、並有體育考察團之組織、各團員均為各大學體育主任及體育有硏究者、希望能將考察所得、取其精華、棄其糟粕、貢獻於政府與國民、以為今後改革劃新之張本、（四）下次世運會將於四年後、在東京舉行、距離吾國甚近、彼時各國運動選手、於參加大會之後、必將來華遊覽觀光、此點深望吾國朝野、先事準備、俾屆時予各團人士以良好印象、（五）本人提倡體育垂三十餘年，迄今未能成就一運動人才、殊為慚慨云云、聞王氏留滬一二日、晋京拜謁當局報告經過、然後赴美　新、</p>
<p>赦更生談考察團長都更生談各國體育觀感、謂（一）此决考察各國、殊覺人家之長處固多、而國人先前眞眞未知者甚少、所愧者人家均有具體的切實的計劃、按步實施、而我則知而未行、實與不知無異、推原其故、實為人的問題、譬言之、德國在世運會期間曾召集各國研究體育者、組織國際學生體育營、其營長者、其行動固可自由、惟其在世運會期間留居營中、寸步不離、從未參觀世運會一日、此種忠於職守、樂於担負之精神、殊足效法、國人固能個個同一精神、同一觀念、則大下無事不可為、（二）吾國體育、近年來雖政府竭力提倡、已引起一般之注意、惟考其注意程度、尙不及各國一般之水準、當須繼續加緊努力、不僅在口頭的學理方面、而且要充分表現在實際的行動方面、（三）稽諸各國敎育之趨勢、殊覺今後吾國敎育之立塲、須以國民體格為一切敎育之先、敎育之第一原則、卽為鍛鍊身體、蓋體育者、為德智之本、有强健之體格、然後能進德修學、成為理想的健全的國民、（四）考各國之進步、實由於能取人之長、補已之短、富有改革的勇氣、吾國欲於髒育方面、有所推進、亦唯有努力實行、方能有所作為、雖然各國有各國之國情、他國適用者、未能盡合於中國、要亦捨短採長、取精用宏而已云、</p>
<p>紹汝幹談</p>
<p>（一）本屆世運各項成績、較前有顯著之進步、我代表團雖無成績表演、以慰國人、惟參加者已竭其能、因體格懸殊、技術稍差、以致相形見絀、但大批人數參加、引起數十萬觀衆之注意、亦足以改變國際之視聽、（二）世運上上之珍貴紀錄、並非偶然、實具相當實力、高超技能、此層非持久練習不為功、（三）國民有普遍運　之好尙、才能產生優良人才、而政府與人民之熱烈提倡、允為必要、（四）各　運動、有獨特意識之發揚、今後吾國體育界、亦當十分注意、而普及民衆體育意識、允為富前至要工件、（五）考察歐洲各國體育、以其社會國家政治之背景、形成其特有之意識、髒育行政組鐵、已入於政治組織為根據、非政府統制、無推行發展之效、（六）考察團已將報告書初稿完成、關於吾國今後體育有詳細建議、採人之長、補已之短、迎頭實幹、一九四〇年或能在東京抬頭也云云、</p>
<p>金兆均談</p>
<p>各國政治家敎育家、認體育為一種强種立國之基本事業、在本屆世運會、除運動競技之外、更有關於體育敎育問題之集會、更可以證明前言之不誤、各國環境、均有不同、故歐美各國、多根據本國環境、而創造一種適應特殊環境之體育國策、此種現象、允以英·美·德·意·丹麥·瑞典為特甚、以上各國均有特殊顯著之體育功效、因此我倘人第一種感想是中華民國之體育國策、亦必須根據我們特殊環境、而確定一種至少十年敎訓之計劃、藉以復興中華民族、第二種感想是各國體育事業之平均發展、不若吾國之畸形發展、他們已把社會和學校打成一片、在我國社會體育固遠不如人、卽以學校體育而談、小學體育問題、至今沒有一位能專心研究、並切實去做、卽大中各級學校、亦各呈猗形發達之現象、此急待解决之第二要事、最後一種感想就是歐美各國當道、多有埋頭快幹的精神、這是我們目前最需要的一種精神、</p>

<p>蔡文禮於新加坡登岸時、與同輪歸國之上海社社長薛光前談、歐洲之足球戰術、方法奇特、正中衛祇在前後一直綫、兩後衛與左右中衛一前一後、有時後衛侵進至前鋒左右輔亦退守後衛之職、神出鬼沒、其傳球宛如吾人之玩籃球、得心應手、萬無一失、其在門邊擲出界之球、能一擲至對方門上、猶如平常之罰角球然、在英國參觀職業之足球賽、嘆為觀止、觀其訓練方法、允使人折服、我國隊自被英國淘汰、八月十一日卽離柏林、赴各國觀摩、表演賽共七次、一勝一和五敗、在巴黎之戰表演最佳、歐州各國人士對我國隊之運動精神、極為佩服、對於技術上之批評、所謂極「淸脫」Clean、故對我國隊之印象極深、至於失收之緣因、厥有三點、（一）體力不充、（二）傳球不準、天氣關係、至前港報傳李國威因傷殞命之說、完全無稽云、又籃球在德友誼賽三次、勝義大利與秘魯、敗於美國、正式賽首遇日本、不幸卽遭敗北、繼勝法國、終又敗於秘魯巴西、綜觀對日一塲之失敗原因、（一）由於球昌臨塲惶張、不能充分表演共技能、（二）由於戰法呆滯、不能隨機應變、反為敵所任意佈排、而無法應付、僅罰球一項、吾國有十五次擲籃之機會、結果祇擲進二次、殊屬可惜云、</p>

<p>標花空頭大量賣出</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、近月尙堅、惟拍至遠月、趨鬆懈、二盤近平遠昂、但三收盤、跌風驟熾、因大戶又來拋賣、近月跌風殊烈、實係美棉因南方套賣而跌十一至十六磅音、印棉亦挫、三品花跌三四角、於是逢漲時拋者尙不乏人也、查大孚空頭大量加碼、通記恒益賡豐望泰興源興昌等則一致拋出、惟裕大長豐蹙批補空、吉豐森康愼記元一生源均買進、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二角至三角半、午時開盤市象特虛、以其君大量賣出、在跌三角、遠跌一角、一盤以後、仍屬平平、迨至收盤遠期回好五分至一角、結果各月比上牛收盤價再跌一角至二角半、查賣出晉康三千一百担、大孚五千五百担、通記三千一百担、恒益二千二百担、赓豐四千担、望泰興六千八百担、豊泰三千六百担、仁豐一千三百担、益康千六百担、新昶二千担、買進吉豐三千四百祖、裕大四千四百担、愼昌二千八百担、森康二千一百担、愼記二千一百担、元一四千二百祖、長豐七千祖、源興昌三千二百担、長和四千六百担、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、各月份市面、呈初平繼則猛漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二角、坎拿大好五六角不等、當開價時、因洋麥回升、人心轉穩、較之前日收價、計好一分、迨至二盤、以時局和緩、並以麵粉關乎民食、國內之存底、不能維持一年之需、而津銷轉暢、辦動甚殷、洋麥一時又難定通、致買氣重振、卽好二三分、迄至下午開盤、交易旣暢、市面突飛猛漲、各月份之市値、均為改幣後之新紀錄、半以津帮仍續暢辦、半則因日夾米價之高提、且時局如果惡化、麥到當更稀少、人心之挺秀、殆側重於此、最後結果、近遠期一致高抬七八分不等云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源較前允稀、共到近二十號貨共四千來石、常帮西新粳業已上市、米質圓潤豐滿、洵屬佳品、價開十元零七角、百哥窰種市况、因到稀銷旺、開價步升、若靑島大連龍口等帮辦進四百餘包、結果行情繼增半元、新粳市亦相同、杜洋等各色新尖、亦跟上三尺、惟觀乎午市現象、似巳轉懈、蓋其連日暴漲後、終有一度回降、至於破礱厚粳略高角許、薄稻則以包胃辦去四百餘包、市好起二三尺不等、陳變元乏貨無市、新陰元反以供過於求、獨降一二角、</p>

<p>昨日客秈消化突旺、而到頭反稀、市面立卽飛騰、前昨每天到頭只有數千包、而咋日本客去仆、竟達二萬包之多、且有天津等北洋帮採辦、形勢更已活潑、粤汕去路不絕、本街續辦外、內地帮亦有點綴、貨主已不似日前之急求脫手矣、價乃立漲一二角、全日開出江西米七千多包、湘米八千包、漢糙四千二百三十五包、台蕪粵各機米等四百五千包、糙米多數為粵帮辦去、機米則以北洋與本街汕頭為健云、</p>

<p>— 慕傑</p>
<p>精神與事業有密切的連帶關係；</p>
<p>什麽是精神呢？精神大的可分二種：一種是大無畏的精神；一種是勤苦耐勞始終如一的精神；這二種精神合起來，就生出我們做一切事業的「力」。我且舉幾個例子：以個人論，大發明家愛迪生，大科學家富蘭克林的成功，不就是奮鬥的力量嗎？以多數人論，法國革命，美國獨立的成功，不也是奮鬥的力量嗎？然而奮鬥就是因為有上面二種精神的緣故。我們且把國父孫中山先生的革命當作例子，假使中山先生不是具着上面二種精神的話，那末怎會辛亥共和的肇造呢？早挫折於十餘决的失敗了！</p>
<p>「力」是成功事業的原動力；而只有精神才會生出「力」來，所以精神與事業有密切的連帶關係。</p>
<p>小朋友，牢記着！精神是人類的特有物，用了一分精神，才有一分事業。</p>

<p>明帝辯日</p>
<p>晉朝明帝纔只幾歲的時候，一天，坐在他父親元帝的膝上。有人從長安到來，報吿着洛下的消息，元帝潛然流淚。明帝問『為什麼哭呢？』元帝把東渡的意思細細地講給他聽，順口便問他：『你想起來是長安遠呢，還是太陽遠呢，我的孩子？』他答道：『太腸遠，因為我們沒有聽見過有人從太陽邊來，於此可知了。』元帝見他小小的年紀居然有此識見，心中很是高興。明天，元帝宴集羣臣，談起那段言語，當塲重再試問明帝一下。不道今天他父答稱「太陽近」了－元帝不禁變色－大槪因為他原要賣弄他自己兒子的聰明，這麽着不免弄巧成拙的綠故－喝問道：『為什麽你今天的話與昨天的不同了？』明帝徐徐地解釋道：『仔細想來，我們舉目便見太陽，却見不到長安。』</p>
<p>「太陽離開我們有多少遠？不知用幾多長的竹竿可以戳到太陽？……這些問題，恐怕　何一個孩子的小腦筋裏曾經盤旋過；可憾的是他們儘向成人們請敎過還是不得滿意！其實，這等孩子們自動需要的常識，為尊長者應該乘機不憚煩瑣地講授給他們的。明帝所得的比例問題，原只是他父親試騐他的理想靈敏與吾。他所答的日遠之設是理論的概念，日近之說是詩意的發揮。他根本不懂得這些，祇為要自圓其說，却不期然而然地暗合着；這所以可稱為「天才」！</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>法國的政府，鑒於這個非常時期，萬分的危險，歐洲方面，第二次大戰，隨時有一觸卽發的可能性，而在未來大戰之中，空軍又將成為一種主力戰。所以已開始訓練小飛行家了。在學校中的兒童，自九歲以上至二十一歲以下的，一槪要受航空訓練，一切計劃，已由航空部長决定。这次法國的所以要使靑年學子，受到航空訓練，為的是萬一世界大戰發生，目前法國所有的航空人才，還是不够，非得要有若干靑年加以遞補不可。而目前訓練計劃，分三步進行。</p>
<p>第一步：使九歲以上，十四歲以下的兒童，受到關於航空上初步學識的訓練。</p>
<p>第二步：十四歲以上，十七歲以下的兒童，予以航空學識上的訓導。</p>
<p>第三步：十八歲以上，二十一歲以下的，便實行使他們實習飛行了。</p>
<p>據法國航空部長向人表示作那麽這樣的訓練對於法國的民航和軍航，前途都有相當裨益的。而且更適於法蘭西靑年的。同時，航空部方面，將另設一科，專管這種航空訓練。這樣的訓練，費用旣少，但不久的將來，就會有大批的飛行家養成，使法國各地，都有航空人才。一待着手訓練，更按期要加以考騐；總之，法國的學校，不久就要實行航空訓練而產生無量數的小飛行家了。</p>

<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>在從前，某國的帝王發一封公文到別一個國度要去，公文的內容，這樣的寫着：「送一隻有黑尾巴的藍色的猪給我；否則——」那別一個國度的帝王也回他一道公文，「我沒有這麽樣的一隻猪；如果我有的話——」</p>
<p>兩國問的帝王都生氣了，到底彼此宣起戰來。召集大兵，打了幾十塲血戰。勇猛的兵士們死了不少，婦人與孩子們無衣無食，亦有許多冷死餓死了的。</p>
<p>後來兩國問的帝王都覺得彼此的兵力不相上下，我勝不得他，他也勝不得我，彼此爭持無益，大家都覺有息戰講和的必要。可是第一件要解决的問題，便是先得將兩家的公文明白解釋一下，因為甲國的帝王不滿意於乙國的答覆；乙國的帝王不滿意於甲國的要求呀！</p>
<p>乙國的帝王問道：「你是什麽意思，呌我送你一隻有黑尾巴的藍色的猪呢？否則又怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「為什麽嗎？」甲國帝王說：「我的意思是很簡單的，我呌你送我一隻有黑尾的藍猪，否則其他顏色的也好。」</p>
<p>「唉！就是這樣嗎？」乙帝王說，「可憐我沒有收得你的公文的全部呀！」</p>
<p>「但我却要問問你，」甲帝王說，「你的覆文是什麽用意呢！『我沒有這麽樣的一隻；如果我有的話——』這是什麽意思？」</p>
<p>「哦，」乙帝王說，「我的優文像你的來文一樣的簡單，我說我沒有這樣的一隻；如果有的話，我便可以送給你了。」「好了！好了！」甲帝王說，「我們已經白白戰爭了一陣了。倘使我們在戰爭之前，好好解釋明白，那末一切的損失一切的痛苦，都不是避免掉了嗎？」</p>
<p>後來兩國的帝王，都將這一件「黑尾的藍猪」的戰事載弁史册，讓大家時時警惕，不致再發生同樣無謂的戰爭。</p>

<p>— 君啟</p>
<p>小朋友們！當早上起來，我們一定要做一番洗臉刷牙的淸潔工作，才會覺得身體舒暢，這是由於皮膚淸潔的關係，一個人的皮膚，有調節體溫的功用，皮膚堅强，能耐寒耐熱，才會日變強健，精神愉快哩。</p>
<p>我們要保護身體，必先鍛鍊皮膚，他的方法很多，以冷水洗浴最好。但是須要有訓練，慢慢兒才能收效；否則非但身體不强，反要發生大疾病，這是要十分注意的，所以舉行冷水洗浴的習慣之前，最初的基本訓練是用冷水洗臉：一方面容易訓練：一方面不致發生疾病。</p>
<p>冷水洗臉雖祗有手和臉二小部分，但因他常和空氣直接接觸，故當先鍛鍊，然後漸漸到全身，便成功了冷水洗浴的好舉動。</p>
<p>開始冷水洗臉，最好在夏天。以後天氣漸冷，但仍抱定主張，堅持到底，能經嚴冬，此習慣養成後，不但皮膚結實，並能使身體增加康健力，對於小朋友是很有益的。希望各位小朋友努力的實行！</p>

<p>福岳在中秋那天晚上，當然也和諸位小朋友一樣，在自已的小院子內，跳着，玩着，就何等的快樂，手裏拿着月餅，且吃且笑，嘴裏讓着道一月亮！月亮　你像隻盆，像隻碗，下來玩玩吧！」坐在椅子上的福岳的父親，指點着天上的月亮說：「福岳！你曉得中秋的月亮，為甚麽比任何月圓時，覺得格外光明呢？」福岳默默不語，父親接着說：「這是因為秋天的夜裏，是天高氣爽的緣故。」福岳問道：「月亮是那裏來的？」父親笑道：「月亮的來歷，是實在不可思議的。在不知幾千萬幾萬萬年以前，太陽在天空中很快地旋轉，因為迴旋的振動，就分離出一大塊，另在空中存立了，跟着太陽不住的旋轉，因旋轉力很遠的結果，形狀漸成橢圓形，這就是地球」。後來「地球」也和太陽一樣，當「地球」幾千萬年以後，因為它不是火球，所以漸漸冷却，但「地球」面上生了一個好似肉瘤的小塊，漸漸大起來，受了旋轉的振動，和太陽的波動作用，突然離開「地球」，而繞着「地球」不住地旋轉，也在空中另成一個，這就是月亮」。它的體　的有五千立方哩，直徑的有三千四百七十六，距離「地球」，的有三十八萬四千四百餘基羅米突，要想到月裏去走一趟，飛機要一百多天，火車要三百多天，但只有理想，是决不可能的事。」</p>
<p>福岳的父親，抽了一根香烟，繼續着說：「月亮的光，是由太陽光的直射，才反射到「地球」上來，大的有四十億支光，我們看見頂亮的地方，就是火山，較暗如山形的地方，就是山谷和海，每月中，月球上，半個月是白晝，牛個月是黑夜，日裏　度百度以上，夜間忽降到零度百數十度以下，所以大氣圈和水分層，根本上是沒有，生物自然不必說了。月亮初一到十五圓起來，十六到三十缺下去，因為「太陽」，「地球」，「月球」時地位的不同，有時，「月球」走在「太陽」和「地球」之間，適為一平行綫，就成「日蝕」。「地球」走在「太陽」和「月球」之間，也適為平行錢，就成「月蝕」。</p>
<p>上面的一段談話，是在中秋的那天晚上，到福岳家去玩玩，聽到後，覺得很有趣味，很有價値，所以介紹給諸位，想必小朋友們一定都樂聞的吧！</p>

<p>小敏自從在暑假中向小勇討了一對鴿子後，他天天很紐心的替它們洗操，喂食，打掃鴿棚等事，所以兩個月以來，一對鴿子已長得很肥大了。那雪白的羽毛襯着紫紅色的眼睛，有誰看了不歡喜。</p>
<p>有一天，小敏正在替它們做工作的時候，他的弟弟仁兒問他道：「敏哥，在我們的禽類中，鴿子有那幾種呢？」小敏一面打掃着鴿棚，一面用小口回答道「仁弟，據我所知道的，共有五種：一，眼競鴿，二，突胸鴿，三，傳書鴿，四，野鴿，五，孔雀鴿。　　敏哥你剛才所說的幾種鴿子有什麼用處呢？我剛才所說的幾種鴿子的用處一，眼鏡鴿在它的眼睛四周好像和人戴眼鏡一樣的，有一層亮晶晶的東西，所以呌它眼鏡鴿，它的用處除供玩養外，蛋和肉可以吃。二，突胸鴿：它的胸突起，所以呌突胸鴿它的用處和眼鏡鴿是沒有什麽兩樣的。三，傳書鴿：它的用處因為它的記憶力强，能够從很遠的地方飛來飛去，所以在軍隊中是用傳遞消息的。四，野鴿；它的肉和蛋都可吃，別的內臟和毛可以作肥料用五，孔雀鴿，它的尾巴毛很長，能開能摺，和孔雀一樣，所以呌孔雀鴿，它的用處和眼鏡鴿是一樣的。</p>
<p>敏哥，鴿子和鷄，有什麽不同的地方？</p>
<p>鴿子和鷄不同的地方，簡括的講起來有幾點，先講鴿子：一，嘴除在前端以外餘者都有軟皮遮蓋，二，後肢很短小，雄的鴿子沒有距。三，性聰明易馴，不喜爭鬥，四，雄鴿子和雌鴿不容易看出，五，翅膀長大而尖，飛時很决的。六，喜吃果實，穀類。至於鷄呢，一，嘴的全部分很硬，沒有軟皮遮蓋，二，後肢强大，雄的有距。三，性喜鬥。四，雌鷄雄鷄容易看出。五，翅膀短小，不能够飛。六，喜食蟲，穀，果實。</p>

<p>（我第一次到上海來）</p>
<p>『上海是一個很華麗，很複雜的一個』都市，人是很多的，洋房到處都是』。我是時常聽人家這樣講，可是我一個江北老，從來也沒有到這個繁華的上海來過，这次眞是所謂夢想不到的往上海來了，這是多麽高與呀？</p>
<p>到這裏的第二日晚上，就找幾位同學出去觀光觀光。走不少的路，我覺得很奇怪；這怎麽不熱鬧的呢？我正在疑問着的當兒，有一位同學就對我說，「喂！你不知道嗎？這是靜安寺路，所以第一段應該安靜的呀！」，這時我一想眞是不錯，要像前面的靜安寺路的牌子還有什麽洋文哩這裏是應該安靜的。這我才知道，怪不得這裏只有一男一女的在慢慢的走連說話都不敢大聲。其决還有一輛小汽車在走動。我們又向前走了，走到一處，有一個人忽然從對面來喊。『江北猪玀』我又對同學說『猪玀』這句話是什麽意思？同學說『這是罵人的』我說『這眞奇怪，為什麽喊『猪玀』就會駡人呢？這位同學說『猪玀』是這裏的入駡江北人的，但是江北人也有駡這裏入的呌做『赤佬』！哦我才知道『赤佬』是上海人『猪玀』是罵江北人的，再走不遠功夫我說：『這裏的外國人為什麽這樣多呀？』同學說：『因為這是租界。』這時我又奇怪了為什麽有什麽英租界，還有什麽法租界呀？同學又對我說：』租界就是我們中國地方租給英國或租給別的國家，這就呌做租界，於是我就問『我們中國在外國有多少租界呀？』同學說『我們中國還想在外國有租界嗎？』我又說『為什麽呢』？同學說：『是較為强的國家在外邊總是會有租界的』，當下我想為什麽强的國家就會有租界，弱小民族就會被人把土地租去，我們中國不是被人租了土地去的一個國家嗎？不是同樣也是一個弱小民族嗎？</p>

<p>伊又把外面羊齒葉中儲藏着的馬鈴薯察看了一下，心想倘將它們一起搬到屋子裏來，那麽被壁爐中的熱氣逼着，也許要逼壞的，因此伊只拿了不多幾個，足够伊們吃一頓就算了。隨後伊又到那母牛身邊去，擠些牛乳出來，但就那可憐的老牲口挨著餓，所以乳也不多，不能儘量的供給伊們。安　尼知道必須給它吃些乾草了。於是喚了伊的兩個弟弟來帮助他們爬上了小閣，開始把那乾草拉將下來，可是他們畢竟是小小的孩子，這工作未免太困難了。到得夜色一上，小閣中一片漆黑，使那兩個小弟弟都吃驚起來。小安葛妮不得不自己動手，拉下了好多的乾草，餵飽了那頭老母牛，並且將它的未舖也舖好了。一會兒已到了用晚餐的時候，姊妹們聚在一起，吃飽了肚子，餐罷以後安葛妮又像昨夜一樣，給伊雙生的小妹妹脫了衣服，把伊們送上床去。一面唱着歌兒安慰伊們入睡，瞧伊們都睡熟了，便和那其餘的弟妹們圍坐在壁爐旁邊，守望著着伊們的父母回來，一點鐘又一點鐘的都側淸耳，聽那門外有沒有親愛的聲音突然到來，有時聽得風聲中似乎有脚步之聲，於是大家都併住了呼吸，聚精會神的等着。一會兒風已吹過了，便又死一般的靜寂下來。夜來又是大雪紛飛，安葛妮一面當心着門窗，不給積雪封住，一面又當心那壁爐中的火，以免被烟囱中的雪刮滅。這一夜伊又守望到了夜半，仍然不見父親和母親回來，也沒有別的人來帮助伊們；伊沒法可想，只得上床去睡了。醒回來時，却見雪下得更大，把伊最後的希望又打消了。伊那親愛而活潑的母親，壯健而勇敢的父親都是爬山的好手，要是伊們沒有遇到什麼意外的話，那麽過了這兩天的功夫，早就回來的了。可憐的小安葛妮好容易挨到了第三天，照樣的看顧伊的弟妹們，大家不住的禱吿着，希望伊們的父母好好地回到家裏來。</p>
<p>第四天的早上，雪已住了，風也變了方向，地上的積雪已吹去了不少，安葛妮立時胆壯起來，由着妹們一同送出門去，沿着一堵低低的石壁，向格拉斯美進發，伊因避免那走過溪橋的危險，所以繞道而行。伊們走了一陣，已到了山脊那裏，安葛妮卽忙打發弟妹們趕快回去，一個人奮勇前進，孤另另地彳亍在那堆滿着雪的廣大的山坡上，一心只想找到伊的父母，忘却了一切的危險，末後才到了格拉斯美最近的一宅屋子門前。</p>

<h3 id="c180">百年前官塲勢派縮影模型 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 錢鳳石</p>
<p>「上海無奇不有」，這句話誰都不能否認的。最近又有一個引人入勝的去處，使看過的人都咋舌稱奇，那便是陳列在大新公司四樓的「家庭縮影模型」。那里有全副舊式嫁妝，舊式喜廳和新房佈置；老法大出喪全副文武大官儀仗；祠堂勢派；舊式壽堂，宴客室，花廳；臨時戲臺；遊湖書舫；蘇式大廚房；以及各項應用傢具。甚至連沿街呌賣的蘇式吃食小販擔子和各別用具，也無不應有盡有，一應俱全。這模型把去今的百年前的舊式宗法社會老古董，有條不紊，活龍活現地送入我們這飽噹歐化的上海人眼裏，使我們油然想到遜淸官塲世家當時的歷歷情况，不禁興起了而今安在之感。</p>
<p>這是久居蘇州城的一位遜淸武官周某，據他那小儀仗的稱呼，此公號呌少甫，挨名周敦厚堂，此公平生沒有甚麽特殊嗜好，差不多是以全部精神來從事於這「小玩意」的。你不要看這都是渺乎其小的模型；它的材料的採用：銅的，鐵的　玻璃的，木質的，綢緞的，瓷的，皮革的，紙的，……無論甚麽質料都是要照眞的準備，定製，定燒，定裱，定縫。比仿景德鎭的瓷，宣城的紙，湖州的綢，……等等，無論價値高低，必須道地定做。因此，這些小玩意的代價往往數十百倍於眞的大玩意呢？而况那種一絲不漏，一毫不苟的像眞入微，更是用盡了心血哩！</p>
<p>一進陳列處的門，我們首先看見一隻畫舫，大凡到過蘇州和無錫的人，立刻便會想到它的俗名呌做「無錫快」，同時，又會聯想到以前承平時候所謂「笙歌畫舫，釵影波先」的景象來吧？這隻船雖係雛型，但也的有八九尺長。全身用眞桐油髹漆，上好木料製成。分成五艙。船頭一艙，除上船處艙板外，佈置成一敞廳式，由船頭艙板入艙處裝有五色玻璃（又似乎為琉璃明瓦片），兩旁臨水處均係下花板上玻窗的水閣式屛門裝置。其前排列太師椅茶儿等各四套。頂上為明瓦天棚，其下懸六角長方高脚紗燈多盞，並結有彩球等。正中一燈，已類洋式保險火油燈神氣，下垂較低。敞廳中置八仙桌一張，椅几俱備，並置有麻雀牌一付。麻雀難，小，却全係眞牙面竹背，骰子莊子俱全。几上蓋碗茶，水烟袋等亦均置備齊全。隔一玻璃大屛門之中艙，其佈置與敞廳略同，但此艙為飯廳，中置園桌一，桌上火鍋碗盆手碟筷匙棋備。桌椅亦漆色鮮明。由飯廳屛門入内，則為一臥遊之處，置有坑桌一具，坑墊，大痰盂，足踏等亦照例佈置妥貼，無一遺漏。中後艙船頂除蓆蓬外，尙搭有凉台一座，備遊客登高一望，其形如晒台，然甚精雅，四柱均懸明燈。後艙中則船家應用之物亦全部齊備。舟中之　，舵，棹，槳，篙，錨等，亦莫不像眞。如果放之中流，必也行動如意，華麗悅目的。</p>

<p>喜廳（見圖一）高的三尺，長方的四尺，下係三大開間之前後敞廳，為一舊式官宦家之大廳縮影。樓上則分隔為三間。中為祖先堂，其左為新房，其右為伴嫁臥房與新娘之箱子問合設處，除棗紅漆大被箱兩只之外，又有大小硃紅漆衣箱等十二隻，均如法排列房內。新房佈置之鮮艷華麗，使人目不暇接，總之，有美皆備，無麗不臻而已。全副裝　區則置於樓下喜　內，凡陳列舊式硃　漆槪盒各色數十架。綺羅錦　，衣裳被履，無不五彩紛披，富歷堂皇。尤其有趣的是硃紅漆的所謂子孫桶——便桶，完全照俗例，大大小小擺了幾十個，且部是上等紅漆金邊。</p>
<p>壽堂之大小略如喜堂，傢具完全為紅木所製。不過沒有樓。壽幛聯對等掛滿其中，懸燈結彩，金字與紅燭爭輝，掩映之間，確有目的人壽，金玉滿堂之概。後廳設備雖較簡單，但餐桌，坑床，帳房桌均備。而文房四寳，　　算盤，蕞爾羅列，允覺有味。壽堂陳列處之前有祠堂門樓一座。略如廟門，不過沒有泥　　，而門樓四壁却環列着　匾無數，都是左　　對成雙。如世襲翰林院　經博士，武功將軍，賞戴花翎…等等。祠堂之旁又有水閣凉亭　　花廳一座。其旁為蘇式官廚房一所（見圖　），計分三問。佔三分之二的為廚房。北首　　眼大　一座，鐵鍋，湯　俱全。　之外，　　，碗櫥及各式廚房川具，柴米油鹽七件事，部分別方位，擺列整齊。另三分之一地方，父　出傭人吃飯處一間；　人臥處一問，其上　小擱樓，　樓上　　　。籃稍等，逼眞為傭人所</p>

<p>用之物。零碎瑣屑，非常仔細。同　一處呼應着的，便是一處小販擔子大全了。比較起來，以前所述的幾處富貴人用品都是細　，小販擔予則完全是粗貨。舉凡賣炒白菓擔子，賣酒娘，餛飩，湯　，烘山芋等等，連扁擔帶雨具都各各置辦周到。此外還有　座百年前的露天戲台，那是一種大衆娛樂的廟會戲台式樣。台口滿掛百年前名角名字牌，台上並有兩個布紥的人，一個是孫悟空模樣，一個是金面妖怪模樣玩鋼又的，原來正在演大金錢豹。</p>

<p>最特色的要算那大出喪儀仗了。總計有大小二百多件東西，如門槍旗，對牌，銘旌，丹旐亭等，其中亭子二十種，傘四五種，轎三四種，以及十八般武器，各種奠幛，鑼鼓音樂　器等，都較真者縮小十倍左右，而拖長已至四丈　。最後為靈堂，中供靈位，旁懸輓對數十付。其實，這些都是這位少甫老先生在前開的玩笑，所以靈堂的橫匾，有人題贈「夢醒黃梁」四字。有兩付輓聯說得好。其一云：「渺乎小焉，真儀仗真堪寓目；戲兮謔矣，假出喪假作傷悲。」其二云：「此世須知皆幻夢，誰人不作如是觀？」看了這兩聯，大槪誰也都要說是恰到好處吧？</p>

<h3 id="c184">由「小軍隊」理論到「總體戰」理論 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 章少川</p>
<p>上次世界大戰以後，在戰術的講求中最流行的一種理論便是所謂「小軍隊」理論。如英國的胡拉，意大利的德斐，德國的扎克特，都是著名的軍事評論家，但他們卽是「小軍隊」理論的倡導者。依他們的說法，在將來的戰爭中，武裝國民，武裝廣大的民衆，是不必要的；因為武器的發展，軍事技術的進步，只須以具有最新武器的小軍團，深入敵人的腹部，給與破滅的打擊，卽可獲得勝利。德斐以為只要載有五六千噸炸彈的千五百架轟炸機，破壞敵人的空軍根據地，握着空軍覇權，給與敵國心臟內部以破滅的打擊，勝負問題便就解决了。胡拉主張用—萬人的機械化的小軍隊，携帶兩千輛戰車，四百門汽車化的大砲與數百架飛機，突破敵人戰綫，侵入敵國，以奪取勝利，結束戰爭。意大利著名的襲擊戰的論者亞達古尼也認為「奇襲的要　」在戰局中有决定的作用，因之他主張用小軍隊侵入敵人後方以致勝。由這樣的「小軍隊」理論看來，將來的戰爭是不會持久的，而且也不會有好大犧牲的；事實上「小軍隊」理論的倡導者們也常向一般人民說：未來的戰爭只須用少數精銳部隊，在很短的時間內以「奇襲」致勝，所以决不會像上次大戰那麼殘酷。</p>
<p>像這樣的「小軍隊」理論，當然不是那些軍事評論家憑空想出的；它的產生實有一定的社會依據。這我們可以分做如下幾點來說明。</p>
<p>第一，在一九一四—一八年的世界大戰中，許多資本主義的國家人民都覺醒了轉來，因而使那些國家發生了嚴重的國內戰爭，幾乎結果了資本主義的生命。大戰告終後，帝國主義列強為了市塲的爭奪，更積極準備第二次世界大戰；但在另一方面，它們却又怕上次大戰中所發生的那樣的「不幸」事件再行重演，因此便不敢武裝國民，並創造了「小軍隊」的理論；同時又向大家說：第二次世界大戰經過的時間定然很短，也不會有上次大戰那樣殘酷，企圖欺騙大家，使人們的反戰思想為之動搖。</p>
<p>第二，戰後成立的凡爾賽條約，一面規定德奧等國不能重整軍備，另一面又造成了凡爾賽體制的強大力量：這便使得那些軍事評論家以為帝國主義間總動員的戰爭將無由發生；卽使世界有戰爭發生，也不過機械化的「小軍隊」襲擊戰爭，動員全國的戰爭實無必要。同時，「小軍隊」襲擊強鄒，侵略殖民地，進攻新國家的理論，也就應時而生了。</p>
<p>第三，「小軍隊」理論的產生與某些國家的國情也有深切的關係。例如　斐的空中戰爭理論，便是從各方面都不如其他帝國主義列強的意大利出發的。因為意大利的經濟軍事與英法等國比較起來，都較落後；同時它所處的地位也比較不利，所謂「地中海的囚人」，便是它的稱號；所以德斐才在企圖利用最新軍事技術——飛機——來挽救和發展意大利之下，創造了他那樣的理論。又如胡拉的主張，也是適合於英國的特殊情形的。因為大英帝國在世界上擁有廣大的殖民地，要它用廣大的陸軍來保護是不可能的；對它重要的是海軍和空軍；而胡拉的主張也正是為的這一點。</p>
<p>但是，現在的情形可完全不同了。隨着列強間的矛盾的發展，各國軍備擴充的競爭，國際條約的被破壞，不僅使第二次世界大戰的問題日益現實化，而且在各種事實上已明白表現出了這次大戰必然比上次的更為殘酷，交戰國間的力量亦必更為強大，所謂「小軍隊」的理論在實際上是已經破產了。現在，這理論的發祥地德意兩國已在總動員中，誰也不會再重視那樣的「小軍隊」理論了。事實告訴我們：德國已創設了百萬以上的軍隊；一旦戰爭發生，不僅全國男子，卽所有婦女亦要動員起來。至於意大利，它在遠征東菲時，卽在實際上動員了百萬以上的軍隊；去年意大利更規定國民從八歲起卽當受軍事教育；慕索里尼最近也公然向全世界作誇耀的宣言，說一旦有事，意大利在短短的時間內卽可動員八百萬以上的軍隊！此外，如波蘭，法，英，日本等國也在努力總動員中。這樣，所謂「小軍隊」的理論便為「總體戰」所代替了。</p>
<p>所謂「總體戰」，是軍國主義的軍事智慧之最高的表現。在目前的德意以及其他軍國主義的國家中，論述「總體戰」的著作非常流行。所謂「殲滅戰」，「戰爭科學」，「完全的戰爭」，「總體的勝利」，便是希特勒和慕索里尼的軍事代言人們最時髦的論題。同時，在德意的學校中，某些學科的教授向學生們講的，也多是「總體戰」以及與之有關係的理論。這樣，「總體戰」便成為與德意現行的政體不可分離的東西了。</p>
<p>那末，「總體戰」的意義是什麼呢？它的內容又如何呢？依目前德意等國軍事評論家的解說，則是：第一，不僅要將全國軍隊驅赴戰塲，而且要使全體國民參加戰爭，不僅要行軍事的動員，而且必要全國民之經濟的及「精神的」總動員；第二，佔領某一地方並不是為政治的目的，而是以完全殲滅敵人為目的的；第三，「總體戰」是利用一切可能的手段，無限制而且無容赦地以决死的覺悟而進行的戰爭。「總體戰」的作者魯登多爾夫脫說：「……在世界大戰的時候，交戰國必要在若干啟羅米突的交戰地帶戰爭；與戰爭本身同樣，將會使戰　附近的居民疲憊；在這個完全的意義上，戰塲必會擴大到交戰國的全土。不僅軍隊，就是　民也要直接地參加戰爭，雖然其參加的形式　程度上有些不同。…總體戰，不僅對於武裝兵，就是對於國民，也要直接地進行戰爭。……總體戰對於全國國民實際上要發生致命的威脅。……」這便是「總體戰」的本質。</p>
<p>對於戰爭與政治的相互關係問題，「總體戰」的理論家們也有特殊的解說。如魯　多爾夫主張：</p>
<p>「……戰爭的本質變化了，政治的本質變化了，從而對於軍事的指導的政治關係也變化了。……戰爭與政治是用以維持民族生　的，而戰爭更是民族生存慾之高度的表明。所以，政治不得不侍奉軍事的指導。」依他的　張，則無論國內政治和對外政治都必須侍奉戰爭，在這點上便有了所謂「總體政治」。</p>
<p>在這個戰爭與政治的關係的問題上。軍事評論家的意見雖有一些不同之點，但對於「總體戰」與「總體政治」的擁護，他們却　樣賣力的。</p>
<p>至於「總體戰」勝利的意義，據那　　事評論家看來，則是在於完全地永遠地征服　人，奴化別的民族。有一位「總體戰」理論家　道：「未來的戰爭，不僅在武力行使的意義　，就是在結果的遠大性上，也將是總本的。　言之，總體的勝利，其意義便是敗者的總體　破滅，便是從歷史的競爭塲裏敗退下來的敗　之完全的徹底的消滅。……在這種戰爭中，　有勝利者和敗北者，只有生存者和在民族的　簿上被除名的民族。這戰爭并不由法律的　　，而是由事實上的軍事行動的停止而告終。……」依據這種說法，一般人民如果不起來為　國主義者拼命，那他們的民族便有被永遠消　的危險：這顯然是軍國主義者在故作危言，　圖煽動起他們的人民起來為他們拼命，以征　別人，奴化別的民族。</p>
<p>然而，不管怎樣，「總體戰」總是有　大的內在危險的；那便是在全國國民的總動　中，在殘酷的戰爭的開展和延長中，侵略主　　的多數國民必會逐漸覺醒過來，用侵略主　者給與他們的武裝來反對侵略的戰爭，來爭取他們自身的自由和解放，以圖人類永久的和　。這樣可怕的事變是帝國主義者在上次大戰　就經</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>騐過的。所以，當他們高唱「總體戰的戰歌之時，另一方面又提出了戰時軍隊的編制及軍隊和一般國民的思想問題。他們主張將富家子弟和平時受過嚴密訓練的兵士編入一般部隊中去起領導作用，又主張以各種有效的方法去宣傳和訓練一般兵士，使他們能堅决地為祖國而戰爭，為獲得最後勝利永遠征服他人而戰爭。同時，對於一般國民也實行嚴重的監視和壓迫。前述的魯登多爾夫會經公然呌道：「自然，國家，卽總體政治與　體戰的軍事指導部必須採取特別手設。例如，新聞雜誌的嚴重檢閱，為了保持軍事機密的嚴重法律，封鎖與中立諸國相接連的國境，禁止集會，至少要拘捕「不平派一的首腦部，嚴重監視鐵逍運輸與無綫電話的放送。」不過，人　是為自己的利益和他所認為的眞理而努力的；我們相信就在帝國主義的嚴重壓迫和各種欺騙之下，他們的多數國民也不會因此就忘掉自身的利益和自身所當認識的眞理：因此，在「總髒戰」的開展中，帝國主義的多數國民由於受到更大的苦痛，必會起更大的反抗，而帝國主義的危機當然也就更大了。</p>
<p>這樣，由「小軍隊」到「總體戰」的發展，可說是帝國主義的侵略行為的發展，同時也就是它們　危機的發展。</p>

<p>— 陵</p>
<p>在中國所有的節日當中，中秋恐怕要算是最有與趣，最富於詩意的了；雖然照民俗研究者說，紀念中秋是從「殺韃子」起，然而流傳到今，已完全成為敬祀月神的日子了。</p>
<p>月，在一般人的眼中，的確是一個十分神秘的東西，在世界各國都有關於月的種種故事和傳說，而這些傳說與故事又都較其他節日的來得美麗，溫婉。單就我國說罷，有的說在那瓊樓玉宇中住得有一位偷仙丹的美人，名字呌做嫦娥；有的又說其中只住了一隻兎子，朝朝暮暮以搗藥為工作；有的又說還有一位老人在那兒斫梭羅樹。至於在西洋，說有一位女神以狩獵為生，終日在那冰瑩玉潔的月球上騎鹿馳騁；還有說月上有羊羣，有大蟹，有少女觀書等等。在地球上的人常常盼望去看看這塊神秘的地方，因此在傳說中就產生了唐明皇遊月宮等艷麗的故事。在我的家鄉還有中秋「看月華」之舉，說是時至午夜，萬籟無聲之際，月宮轟然大開，宮內有彩輿魚貫而出，是公主出嫁到另一星球上去；看見了這一盛大婚典的人，必走大運。</p>
<p>其實，如果我們有那樣的高梯，能够爬上月球去看一看，這些美妙的幻影便會立刻給打破的。</p>
<p>月球與地球相距不過三八四，三九五公里，卽接連三十個地球，或經環繞地球十决那麽長的路，便可到達月球了。然而，我們的肉眼還不能明視這麽長距離的東四，所以卽使在中秋夜，空氣最淸朗，月光最皎潔的時侯，我們也只能看見一個渾圓的，散發溫柔的靑光的玉盤而已，再仔細的看，也不過看見上面還有一些類似各種人物的黑塊；衡情度理，想來月宮中的美人，兎，鹿等等傳說，都是由想像這些黑塊而來的了。</p>
<p>那末，這些黑塊究竟是些什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>硏究月球的權威者比克林敎授曾在美國威爾遜山天文台，用世界發大的望遠鏡，攝得了一幀直徑三十英寸的月球表面的大照片。從這照片上，我們看見月球不單不光滑如玉，如鏡，而且高低不平，有海，有山，有谿谷，有數不淸的圓圓的洞，可是，這些海，山，洞，谿谷都不像我們地球上所有的那麽美麗。因為月球上沒有空氣，也沒有浮塵，所以被日光射着的地方不會起反射作用，除了那一塊處所耀得人眼花頭脹之外，其餘的部分便黑漆漆地如在深夜似的。在地球上看來，她原是那麽皎潔光亮的一輪，然而她本身一失去日光，卽成為一團黑暗了。再，月球上沒有水，所以就沒有變幻無常的雲彩，而且縱有高山，却沒有奔騰的瀑布，縱有谿谷，却沒有潺潺的細流。至於平林漠漠，如烟如霧，山花野草似茵似錦的景象，那更是沒有的了。這，何其單調！何其荒凉！有人說，月球雖在晝間，她的溫度却仍在冰點以下，卽使有少量的水，也早凝成冰雪了；在我們望遠鏡中所看見的月球表而上那一片白茫茫的東西，也許就是蓋着的冰雪吧。還有，若我們眞有這個本領，能和二三好友飛到月球上去，但因了月球上無空氣，失了傳聲的媒介，我們互相講話，對面也不能聽聞，</p>

<p>大家頓時全成了啞子。除了這個困難之外，還有時時刻刻遭受流星打擊的危險；這些流星有時也落到地球上來，但因在地球的四周包着一層很厚的空氣，流星一落下，這層空氣早把牠的來勢减殺了許多，他又和空氣衝撞，不得不分裂成許多碎片，那時危險便避去了，可是在月球上，這些流星因無阻碍，便和砲彈似的毫不容情地打下來了。</p>
<p>在這一片冰雪的月球之上，旣無江河，又無草木，生物當然不能生長，所以，在月球上，除了岩石，洞穴，高由之外，可以說什麽也沒有的。有些學者說，在若干年前，月球也和地球一樣，是活的，能產生萬物，可是現在死了－整個地死了　她所發射出來的光其實並不是她自身的光，若將這溫柔的光仔細分析起來，可以知道牠的色素完全和日光的一樣；這就說明了月光不過是反射日光所射過去的光罷了。但是月光為什麽不像日光那麽强烈呢？這是因為她所反射的不是日光的全部，而只是日光全部的十分之一。</p>
<p>民國二十五年度的中秋又到了，我們知道了月球上的一切景象以後，該不會再受那些黑塊的幻像的欺騙了吧？</p>

<h3 id="c186">清議與清談 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>似乎歷史上每到國家多事之秋，一般文人學子士大夫之流，有一些便要「淸議」，對於現狀表示不滿，或出之於正面的諫諍，或出之於反面的諷示；另一方面便有一些人要淸談」，自然，他們封於現狀也是不滿的，但是他們却採取消極的態度，對國事置之不聞不問，一天只是飲酒賦詩，遨遊山水。後世的人對於這兩種入也有着許多評論。對於前者，不是說他們能够不避斧鉞，盡瘁國事，便是說他們自討苦吃，何必多此一舉；對於後者，不是說他們只圖「潔身自好一，置國家大事於不顧，不算是大丈夫，便說他們尙能「防身遠禍」，堪稱「隱逸之士」。</p>
<p>但是議論儘管議論，而「淸議」者還是「淸議」，「淸談」者還是「淸談」。不過就我們所知道的，淸談確是比淸議要合算些。淸談者自然有時在言談之間，不能把內心的忿懣抑制得嚴密的時候，也於不知不覺之間流露出一點兒「忿世嫉俗」之意，也有蒙斧鉞之誅的；但是大部分，只要你「小心翼翼」，總是可以「得保首領」或「長為農夫以歿」的。而淸議者那便沒有這樣輕省了。他們之中，如果你眞地是「淸」議，而不是「濁」議，那鮮有不被「將此輩淸流投之於濁流之中」的。最顯明的例子便是明朝的束林黨人。正因為這個緣故，所以日後淸議的入便漸漸少了，也正因為這個緣故，而淸談的人便漸漸多了。</p>
<p>人人都知道的，晋朝的竹林七賢，如稽康，阮籍，劉伶之流，是我們淸談界的開山祖師。他們之中有的是沈溺於酒色，有的陶逸於詩賦。大槪他們會面的時候總是吹牛談天。所談的也不過文學詞章，醉酒婦人，抑或是如「天地之大，蒼蠅之微」的不涉人事的話。他們的言談是「語無倫决」，而他們的行為也「不自檢束」，如醉如痴，如瘋如狂。像這樣的人，眞是「無所事事」，如果舉國都是這樣，那就沒有人來作事了，眞是「淸談誤國」！</p>
<p>說也奇怪，旣然你不能「淸議」，那就規規矩矩，吃你的飯，穿你的衣，睡你的覺好了，又何必定要嚕嚕囌囌，談　談那呢？　得有時不知　　的又不　娛了國，而且還誤了自己的生命，眞是不徹底。我們彷彿記得稽康也還是為了出言不愼而致「身斷於市朝」吧？你裝瘋裝癲，說七道八，國家本來是「措之於磐石之安」的，經你這似乎是有流言作用，有組織的嫌疑的一種造謠生事，那國不是被你誤了嗎？</p>
<p>還有，歷來的君王都是護短的，都是高興人家的謂諛的，就是常人也何嘗不是這樣？你能够淸談，而你的淸談又能相習成風，這樣的人，總該不是凡人，這樣的人，國家總是用得着你的，你總得要為朝廷文過飾非，至少你也得坐食俸祿，沈默寡言，他也才對你放心。要是你故意要表示「高飛遠引」，「潔身自好」，那你就在行動上譏諷了君主，就無異乎把你自己當做「淸」，而把他當做「濁」了。單是這點，你就種了罪孽，何况又還要淸議？因為「朕卽國家」，　對皇上不利，就算是誤了國，所以罪不容誅。</p>
<p>但是，一個好說話的人，而且旣然是人，那又能不「談」？農夫可以談天乾水旱，稻粱黍稷，商人可以談生意經，買賣好不好，那椿生意好做不好做，……那麽士大夫之類又談些甚麼呢？詩詞歌賦自然也是他們談的題材之一，但是光是談這個，還不一樣是淸談嗎？而且歷來的讀書人－士，都講的是「學而優則仕」，那書讀好了他就自然要談到仕方面來，因之也談到國事。在積極的呢，就表現為淸議，在消極的呢，就表現為淸談。總而言之，也不過談談而已，讀書入總是要談的。像這樣的談，固然說不上救國，但其實他們又何嘗足以誤國呢？</p>
<p>實在說來，不管淸談誤國不誤國，但是一到了國之內有了淸談，而且淸談也相習成風，風靡一時，那這時的國總覺得有點不安，國總覺得有點被誤了，被吳三桂一流人物所誤了。於是乎有些人也許就只看見現象而不看見本質，而且就要倒果為因，硬說「淸談誤國」，不問先有國之被誤而後有淸談呢，抑或有了淸談，國才被誤。</p>
<p>如果說淸談一定會誤國，那麽許多的街談巷議不也誤國嗎？那整日坐在茶樓吃茶的人不也是誤國的人嗎？難道我們茶餘酒後都要緘默不成？由此就可以曉得淸談還是有範疇的，而淸談所談的話也是有一定內容的，要某些淸談才不致有誤國的資格，那就是「莫談國家大事，只談風花雪月」。</p>
<p>現在也是淸談流行的時代，不過淸談的技術比從前更進步了，這也許是集了古今中外淸談之大成吧？但這時的淸談斷不會有誤國之嫌，而且也說不上有誤國的資格的。街談巷議和茶餘酒後的吹牛自不用說了，而現時的士大夫之流則費盡心血想出了許多淸談的方法。見面之後除了「今天天氣…哈哈哈」一類之外，有的是電影明星，跳舞明星，箱屍案等等可談，用不着涉及國家大事。至於不安於沈默的文人呢，也可以編編論語，逸經，宇宙風之類的小品文雜誌，來寫一點幽默的文章，也等於淸談一番了。這是决不會誤國的，不怕普天之下都是淸談之家。同時正因為這些淸談都不是誤國的淸談，那麼國也就不會被誤了。</p>
<p>但是所可憂慮的，萬一國家一有被誤－雖不由於淸談－的時候，被殷汝耕輩所誤的時候，那這些不是誤國的淸談家又怎樣去救那已經被誤的國家呢？</p>

<p>Most Residents (Nineteen Out of Twenty) Have Moved Out, Yoshioaka's Cremated Ashes Returned to Japan</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since Yoshioaka's assassination in the Japanese concession in Hankou, the Japanese military has taken extremely strict precautions. Key roads are heavily guarded, and pedestrians are thoroughly checked. Consequently, Chinese residents within the concession feel very uneasy. For days, a continuous stream of people have been moving to the Chinese-controlled areas. As of the evening of the 3rd, nineteen out of twenty Chinese residents in the Japanese concession had moved out. Furthermore, after Yoshioaka's death, his elder brother, Yoshioaka Takeshi, came to Hankou to handle the aftermath. He already carried Yoshioaka's cremated ashes back to Japan for burial on the evening of the 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Concerns Over the Crisis in the Far East, Intelligence Already Exchanged Between Britain and the United States; British Government and Public Actively Monitoring Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Japan Claims That It Will Not Tolerate Interference From Third Countries; Gao Zongwu Meets With Kawagoe and Suma to Discuss Matters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that the British and American governments have already exchanged intelligence regarding the crisis in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources in London have reiterated unequivocally that Britain is not unconcerned about the current crisis in the Far East. If Japan turns all or part of China into its protected territory, or if war breaks out between China and Japan, Britain's interests in China will inevitably be affected. All quarters in Britain still view the current situation as not only very complex but also extremely serious. It is said that the opinions of the British government may already be well known to the Chinese and Japanese governments. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures recently stated that if Japan were to establish hegemony or a protectorate within all or part of China's territory, Britain would certainly consider it a very serious matter. This is because Britain's interests in China would inevitably be harmed. This view has already been conveyed to the Japanese government by Sir Clive, the British ambassador to Japan. Furthermore, Sir Lindsay, the British ambassador to the United States, has also been instructed to consult with the American government regarding the situation in the Far East.

<p>(Nanjing) Gao Zongwu, the Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Ambassador Kawagoe at the Japanese Embassy at 11:30 a.m. on the 3rd to discuss matters. Suma Kiyoshi and others were present. He returned to the ministry at 12:30 p.m. after the discussion. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The meeting between Suma and Gao Zongwu concluded at 3:00 p.m. today. Consul General Suma immediately reported its contents to Ambassador Kawagoe, as well as military attachés Amemiya and Nakahara, and discussed the Japanese side's attitude. Simultaneously, Director Gao Zongwu reported the details of the negotiations to Foreign Minister Zhang, and sent a detailed telegram to Chairman Chiang for instructions.

<h3 id="e4">Arita Invites Xu to Explain Stance <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita invited Xu Shiying, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, to the Foreign Minister's residence at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd. He explained in a sincere manner that this is the time for a comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, which have lasted for many years. He continued, stating that the decisions made at the Three Ministers' Conference were all based on this spirit. Therefore, the visit of Director General Kuwajima to China is to personally convey this decision to Ambassador Kawagoe and to transmit Japan's true intentions. Therefore, he asked not to worry about this point. Ambassador Xu Shiying left at 2:40 p.m. Foreign Minister Arita's detailed explanation is as follows: Today's Sino-Japanese negotiations are important for adjusting comprehensive national relations. Therefore, the outcome will have a great impact on the future of both countries. I explained this when I met with foreign reporters the other day. Reporters from your country were also present at that time, so I believe they are aware of it. I believe that China is currently standing at a crossroads of whether to join hands with Japan. The Imperial government is paying very careful attention to the negotiations under this major situation. I hope that the Chinese side will also appreciate the importance of the situation and fully recognize the Japanese government's determination to implement the adjustment of national relations. The Japanese side's intentions and policies have always been to thoroughly inform Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang Qun. Ambassador Kawagoe and Consul General Suma have repeatedly met and talked with key figures in your government, but because of the inconvenience of telegram exchanges, they cannot freely express their opinions to the fullest extent. Therefore, this time, Director of the East Asia Bureau Kuwajima was dispatched to China to convey the Imperial government's policies to Ambassador Kawagoe and resident officials. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) My Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, accepted the invitation of Foreign Minister Arita and went to the Foreign Minister's official residence at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd to visit Foreign Minister Arita for a talk that lasted one hour. Arita first clarified to Ambassador Xu the mission of Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that Kuwajima's visit was to express Japan's true intentions, so that the Chinese authorities could fundamentally understand them. Arita also expressed his hope that President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang would hold negotiations with Ambassador Kawagoe in the shortest possible time with a frank and sincere attitude, so as to achieve the purpose of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Arita also predicted that all kinds of difficulties could be eliminated. Ambassador Xu immediately replied, saying that the Chinese government has always conducted negotiations in good faith, and allowed Arita's wishes to be conveyed to the National Government.

<h3 id="e5">Sino-Japanese Negotiations Will Not Tolerate Interference <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only expressed critical views on the London telegram regarding the British government's attention to Sino-Japanese negotiations, stating that the British government's concern and attention to Sino-Japanese negotiations, or its active involvement, is a matter of internal British affairs and is not something that the Japanese government is concerned about. Furthermore, until now, no expression of intent from the British government has been received regarding Sino-Japanese negotiations. Sino-Japanese relations should be resolved by China and Japan, and third countries should not interfere. Moreover, it is believed that third countries have no intention of interfering. The Japanese government is only advancing according to its established policy in consideration of the long-term plans for China and Japan. (Domei telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Kuwajima's Talk is Vague and Evasive <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Kuwajima, the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will carry new instructions from the Japanese government to Ambassador Kawagoe in China. Today, before he departed from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru, he met with guests and discussed the overall Sino-Japanese situation for a long time. His conclusion was quite confusing and elusive. Kuwajima said that the suggestions submitted by Japan to China are not a kind of demand. Their purpose is to adjust Sino-Japanese relations in a sincere way. Whether the deadlock in the relations between the two countries can be broken has important interests for the future of relations between the two countries. If China still holds prejudices, Japan will have to think deeply about how to deal with it. If the negotiations do not proceed smoothly, the Japanese government will take plans to deal with the deteriorating situation. However, I believe that the diplomatic negotiations currently underway will not end in failure. After Kuwajima arrives in Shanghai, he will take a plane to Nanjing to report the Japanese government's true intentions and the Japanese government's intentions regarding negotiation techniques recently decided at the Tokyo Cabinet meeting to Ambassador Kawagoe in detail. Kuwajima will not participate in the Nanjing negotiations, but he may have private discussions with a few leaders in Nanjing, and then he will set off to return to Japan.

<h3 id="e7">Lytton Issues Statement Criticizing Japan's China Policy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(London) All the evening newspapers here are full of news from China recently regarding the Sino-Japanese situation. However, the newspapers have not yet published any comments on this. The conditions proposed by Japan this time for resolving outstanding issues with China are actually no different from the four proposals previously leaked by London diplomatic circles: (1) the right to station troops along the Yangtze River to protect overseas Chinese; (2) the right to revise school textbooks to prevent Chinese schoolchildren from being educated with anti-Japanese sentiments; (3) the autonomy of the five provinces in North China; and (4) economic cooperation between China and Japan. The specific nature of the cooperation has not been clearly defined. At present, we have various reasons to believe that the British government has been actively paying attention to the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations, because Britain's major interests in North and Central China make it difficult to stand idly by. Japanese overseas Chinese here strongly oppose the idea of ​​a third party joining the mediation, and seem to have an unhappy impression of the reaction of the Chinese people, especially the relative terms proposed by China this time, because they completely reverse previous precedents. Sir Lytton, who was the chairman of the League of Nations investigation team after the Manchurian Incident, told Reuters reporters yesterday that some Japanese are afraid that after China becomes a prosperous and unified country, Japan will eventually be destroyed one day. Based on this observation, they believe that time is running out, and Japan must establish its position within China's territory before it becomes rich and strong. Lytton also said that this observation by the Japanese is actually illogical. It should be noted that the world has expressed sympathy for Japan's economic needs. However, Japan's policy toward China is ultimately unstable. Lytton said, "The key to all happiness in the Far East lies in the economic prosperity of China, but there may not be many people in the world who fully see this point. Whether the major powers can unite to help China's already started recovery is indeed a problem. Japan will never be affected by the countries' aid to China. If Japan can restore China's friendship and trust, it will be able to benefit greatly." Another observer who pays close attention to the situation in the Far East said that the morale of the Chinese people is now being promoted, and also said that the failure of the recent changes in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces is mostly due to the awareness of the officer class, who are unwilling to blindly follow their leaders and engage in domestic disputes. The prices of Chinese bonds fell slightly today, but this situation seems to be due to caution. There is no evidence of large-scale sales here. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Times said in today's editorial that the reports about Japan's suggestions to China and China's counter-suggestions are purely speculation. If the actual conditions are announced to the public, it will make reconciliation very difficult, and may even become impossible. It also said that one piece of news is very close to the truth, that is, Japanese military leaders insist that Ambassador Kawagoe should avoid proposing conditions to the Chinese government, but should strive to make Nanjing strictly correct the anti-Japanese sentiment contained in its China policy, and make the Chinese government express its acceptance of Tokyo's opinions. Then, the definite steps to implement this acceptance will be gradually carried out. If this move fails, Japan will implement "a step reserved until now." (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Morning Post's Commentary: Britain Should Mediate <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today's Morning Post published an editorial on the tense situation between China and Japan. It stated that the Japanese side's demands are not in the form of an ultimatum. The Japanese government is willing to wait patiently for China to consider its demands. Therefore, the current tense situation has a high hope of not causing future wars. However, the turmoil caused by the tension may have to wait until a remedy other than bloodshed is found before it can be eliminated. For the sake of peace, Britain should intervene. It should be noted that Japan lacks friends. Its mistakes are indeed not few, but if Japan is not isolated in the world, it will be willing to consider any proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Far East issue. Japan's interests lie in this, because China's restoration is no less helpful to Japan than to China itself. Britain should cooperate with Japan in a friendly manner to help China's restoration. Only in this way can peace, prosperity, and happiness be restored in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Tokyo Monitors Overseas Chinese to Prevent Covert Activities <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently issued a notice to its subordinate departments to take various preventive measures to protect overseas Chinese. However, part of the purpose of this protection is obviously surveillance in nature, to prevent overseas Chinese from engaging in covert activities. This is because the Asahi Shimbun published news saying that among overseas Chinese, there are people who are in contact with the central authorities of their country and are engaged in propagating and inciting ideas, as well as other actions that are harmful to Sino-Japanese relations. The report also said that the Tokyo police will do their best to protect Chinese residents who are engaged in legitimate business, and will give them preferential treatment and guidance to conform to the attitude of citizens of a great country. It is said that there are currently a total of 16,000 Chinese overseas residents in Japan, the most of whom are in Tokyo, with 9,000 people. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Because Prime Minister Hirota needs to report on the progress of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, he departed from Ueno Station for Hokkaido at 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd. The main points of the Prime Minister's conversation at his official residence before his departure are as follows: I intended to depart earlier to accompany the observation of the large-scale military exercises and take this opportunity to inspect the conditions in the Northeast region along the way. However, the China issue caused a slight delay and I was able to depart today. Upon arriving in Sapporo, I will immediately present myself to the Emperor and personally report on Sino-Japanese relations and general government affairs. (Domei dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Vice Minister of the Navy Hasegawa, Vice Minister of the Army Umezu visited the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister again, reporting that the opinions of the Army and Navy on the China issue were completely consistent. They decided to jointly support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged various important opinions before leaving. (Domei dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Vice Minister of the Army Umezu visited Vice Minister Hasegawa of the Navy at the Navy Ministry on the morning of the 3rd. They discussed the China issue for 30 minutes. The main topics discussed were the following two items: 1. As a result of reporting the fundamental policy towards China decided by the Three Ministers' Conference to Minister of the Army Terauchi, the Minister of the Army had no objections to this fundamental policy and has replied with full support. 2. The Army and Navy will cooperate even more closely in the future, based on the fundamental policy towards China decided by the Three Ministers' Conference, to support the foreign affairs authorities and simultaneously strive to open up diplomatic negotiations.

<p>(Tokyo) After Foreign Minister Arita decided to dispatch Kuwajima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Nanjing to convey his mission, he summoned five former ambassadors, including Ariyoshi Akira, Obata Yūkichi, Hayashi Kyūjirō, Matsushima Hajime, and Ōta Tamaki, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 1:00 p.m. on the 2nd. Arita first explained the recent negotiations with China to the former ambassadors, and consulted their opinions, discussing matters for three hours. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries decided on new instructions regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. Kuwajima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is taking them to Nanjing. Kuwajima left Tokyo on the evening of the 2nd, and set off from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on the morning of the 3rd. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 5th. He will immediately meet with Army Attaché Kita and Navy Attaché Katō, and decide on the specific policy for starting negotiations to meet Ambassador Kawagoe and Consul General Suma in Nanjing the next day to convey the government's instructions. The matters that Japan is requesting from China, as Ambassador Kawagoe had pointed out when he met with Minister Zhang on September 15, do not go beyond the two major objectives of eliminating anti-Japanese behavior and thoroughly adjusting relations between the two countries. After Kuwajima arrives in Nanjing, he will stay for several days. If necessary, he will directly meet with key figures in China to promote the progress of negotiations from the sidelines. In short, after Director Kuwajima arrives in China, the shift in Sino-Japanese negotiations can determine the future trend of the East Asian political situation. How the process will unfold is most worthy of attention. (Domei dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries decided on new instructions regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. Kuwajima, the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is taking them to Nanjing. Kuwajima left Tokyo on the evening of the 2nd, and set off from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on the morning of the 3rd. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 5th. He will immediately meet with Army Attaché Kita and Navy Attaché Kato, and decide on the specific policy for starting negotiations to meet Ambassador Kawagoe and Consul General Suma in Nanjing the next day to convey the government's instructions. The matters that Japan is requesting from China, as Ambassador Kawagoe had pointed out when he met with Minister Zhang on September 15, do not go beyond the two major objectives of eliminating anti-Japanese behavior and thoroughly adjusting relations between the two countries. After Kuwajima arrives in Nanjing, he will stay for several days. If necessary, he will directly meet with key figures in China to promote the progress of negotiations from the sidelines. In short, after Director Kuwajima arrives in China, the shift in Sino-Japanese negotiations can determine the future trend of the East Asian political situation. How the process will unfold is most worthy of attention. (Domei dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>The Sichuan Provincial Governor's Office convened a military affairs conference for the 25th year [of the Republic] on September 24th at 9:00 AM, officially opening at the joint office of the provincial government. The conference was scheduled for two days, with a break on the 25th and continuing on the 26th, which was the last day of the conference. Because the attendees were all important generals directly under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Rehabilitation Supervising Office, the Duyuan Street, where the provincial government was located, was heavily guarded on the 24th. Attendees included Liu Xiang, the Rehabilitation Supervisor; Tang Shizun, Commander of the 21st Army; Pan Wenhua, Commander of the 23rd Army; Wang Lingxu, Commander of the 44th Army; Division Commanders Fan Shaozeng, Yang Guozhen, Rao Guohua, Chen Lanting, Chen Qian, Xu Yaoqing, and Guo Zhuqi; as well as affiliated brigade commanders, Chief of Staff of the Supervisor's Office Chuan Chang, Adjutant General Liang Jun, Chief of the Staff Office Yan Xiaohu, Chief of the Military Affairs Office Xu Enping, Chief of the Secretariat Liu Dongfu, Chief of the Military Affairs Office Min Yonglian, Chief of the Military Medical Office Zhao Bojun, Chief of the Management Office Tang Hua, and Secretary-General of the Provincial Government Deng Mingjie, totaling more than 200 people. It was the largest gathering in the past two years. The topics of discussion included military supplies, military strength, military affairs, training, and the allocation of troop stations. During the meeting on the 26th, Supervisor Liu also invited Yan Yangchu, Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Government Design Committee, to give a lecture. The contents of this conference were kept strictly confidential, and all levels of participants were strictly ordered by the Supervisor's Office not to disclose any information. The importance of its nature can be imagined, and it is undoubtedly related to the future of Sichuan. Therefore, I will summarize the situation from various sources, as follows.</p>
<p>End of Bandit Suppression Campaign</p>
<p>The military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan Province came to a conclusion after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek entered Sichuan in the last quarter of the 24th year and ordered the armies to launch a large-scale campaign. At that time, the bandits, with their remaining forces, took the route from Songpan and Maogong in western Sichuan and fled into Xikang, plotting to occupy a corner, restore their strength, and then plan to invade again. Later, the two groups of Zhu De and Mao Zedong, and Xiao Ke and He Long, successively entered Kang and joined forces with the Xu Xiangqian bandits. From then on, the Xikang region became the focus of bandit suppression. The Central Army and the Sichuan and Yunnan garrison forces successively entered Kang, encircling them heavily. Although the bandit forces joined forces, they suffered great losses due to years of resistance, and the Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Xiao Ke, He Long bandits had been fleeing for several provinces and were exhausted. How could they resist such a large number of government troops? Therefore, they changed their plan, abandoned Xikang, and joined forces with the Xu Xiangqian bandits in northern Shaanxi, attempting to flee into Suining and open up the so-called international route. In July and August of this year, the bandits fled from northern Kang, passing through the Sichuan-Qinghai border and entering Gansu. At that time, the situation in Songpan, Maogong and other places in western Sichuan seemed very tense. However, the armies in Sichuan had long been strictly prepared, so the bandit forces were severely attacked upon arrival and fled into southern Gansu. At this point, the military affairs of bandit suppression in Sichuan came to an end. However, the bandit forces were constantly fleeing, and the Central Government, in addition to increasing the deployment of Hu Zongnan's entire army to Gansu to cooperate with the units of Zhu Shaoliang, Yu Xuezhong, etc., to intensify the suppression in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop, also transferred the main forces of Sun Zhen's 41st Army and Deng Xihou's 45th Army from Sichuan Province. On the 23rd and 24th, the two units had set out separately. Dong and Zeng's divisions of the 41st Army were stationed in Bikou and Chengdu, Gansu, to carry out suppression as the opportunity arose, while Chen's division of the 45th Army was stationed in Guangyuan, Yangpingguan, and Lueyang in Shaanxi to prevent the bandits from fleeing.</p>
<p>Four Major Issues Currently</p>
<p>Now that the military affairs of bandit suppression have come to an end, the future problems in Sichuan Province are: (1) the reorganization of the army, (2) the allocation of stations, (3) local rehabilitation, and (4) military expenses. Among them, the last one is the most urgent to solve at present. It is necessary to say that the military expenses of Sichuan Province have been reviewed and approved at more than 60 million per year, and have been decreasing year by year since the 25th year [of the Republic]. It is difficult to have a fixed mechanism for appropriation, but due to temporary difficulties in raising funds, the military salaries of various armies have been in arrears for several months. Any undertaking takes economics as a prerequisite, and the army is no exception. Without solving the problem of military expenses, how can we talk about engaging in reorganization? Therefore, the purpose of this military affairs conference convened by the Supervisor's Office is to seek a proper solution so that the aforementioned arrears of salaries can be gradually paid off, and so that it will not be difficult to raise funds in the future. Then, the distribution of other stations and the reorganization problems will not be difficult to solve. Regarding local rehabilitation, the first priority is to eliminate bandits, and the second is to revitalize the government. Since the defeat of the bandit army, the authorities have been determined to govern, and progress has been made in recent years. However, the vitality of the areas ravaged by bandits has been completely lost. Although they have been reorganized, they have not yet returned to their original state. Therefore, many refugees are still wandering outside, and under the pressure of life, they cannot help but become bandits. Moreover, last year, the Sichuan army was once reduced in size, and the demobilized soldiers did not have a proper occupation, so they could not help but take the path of banditry. Recently, newspapers in Chengdu, Chongqing and other places are full of news about bandits, which shows the prevalence of banditry in various places, and the reason is based on this. Although there are designated pacification zones, relying on unreliable security teams to carry out suppression has little effect. In order to eliminate the bandit atmosphere, the provincial government recently established a Sichuan Rehabilitation and Purging Committee, with Chairman Liu Xiang concurrently serving as the chairman, and Commander Deng Xihou concurrently serving as the vice chairman. The entire province is divided into eleven purging districts, and Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian and the three municipalities are designated as special districts. Each district has a commander, who is a brigade commander. Within a short period of time, they are ordered to unite all military police and security teams stationed in the district into a purging force, to undertake the purging, and to combine the strength of the military and the people to jointly eliminate the bandit scourge in the area. After that, there should be no more great difficulties.</p>
<p>Groundless Rumors Arise Frequently</p>
<p>The Department has decided that the defense land left behind by the transfer of the Deng and Sun armies to the Shaanxi-Gansu border will be taken over by which unit, and the authorities have already assigned it. In order to ensure that local security can be permanently maintained, the allocation of stations for the entire Sichuan army must be planned as a whole to avoid uneven distribution of local forces and maintain a balanced state. However, in the situation in Sichuan, whenever there is an extremely ordinary change, rumors arise accordingly. For example, when the Chengdu incident occurred, people generally said that it was directed by someone to deliberately make things difficult for the Central Government, or that someone was sitting idly by and allowing the situation to expand in order to profit from it. A few months ago, there were many rumors about the abnormal movements in Guangxi, and after the overall situation was settled, some people inevitably spread rumors again. Some said that the Central Government would transfer Liu Xiang to lead troops out of Sichuan to garrison somewhere, others said that so-and-so would be transferred to serve as the provincial chairman, and still others said that a certain army would be transferred to garrison in Sichuan Province. In fact, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek entered Sichuan to reorganize the province last year, the local area and the Central Government have become one. The Central Government has no discriminatory views towards Sichuan, and the Sichuan authorities and military and political leaders are all able to obey the Central Government. Chairman Liu's previous dispatch of Secretary-General Deng Mingjie to fly to Guling to meet Chiang Kai-shek was an even clearer expression. How can there be any resentment between the Central Government and Sichuan Province? Chairman Liu also delivered an important speech at this military affairs conference, saying that since the politics of Sichuan Province have been put on the right track and the entire Sichuan army has been unified, from now on, the strength of Sichuan Province will only follow the instructions of the Central Government and unite with the goal of national salvation. Judging from this, the situation in Sichuan Province is generally known. As for the transfer of the Deng and Sun units, it is only to obey orders to defend against and suppress fleeing bandits. If the bandits are eliminated, they will still be transferred back to their original defenses. In short, the future of Sichuan is focusing on rehabilitation and army reorganization. All rumors are not credible. The people of Shu are prone to rumors, and the ancients have already said it before me. (September 25th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Third Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, the Disarmament Committee, had been suspended since the convening of the Disarmament Conference in 1932 for four years. The League of Nations General Assembly restored it only yesterday. The Committee held its first meeting at 4:00 PM today. Norway representative Launchi was elected as the chairman of the committee, and Turkish representative Satik was elected as the vice chairman. Chairman Launchi first stated the circumstances of the suspension of the Disarmament Conference, saying that the results achieved by the past Disarmament Conference were extremely limited, especially because some of the most relevant countries did not participate, so the work could not help but be suspended. As far as the current situation is concerned, the work of the Disarmament Committee should only be limited to exploring the truth of the disarmament issue for the reference of the League of Nations General Assembly. Afterwards, the General Assembly will notify the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference of the results of this exploration. It seems that nothing else can be done. At this point, the chairman announced the start of the general debate, but no one requested to speak for a long time. Therefore, the Third Committee adjourned the meeting to be reopened tomorrow.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on political issues at 10:45 this morning. The Chairman, Argentinian Foreign Minister Lamas, invited the Spanish representative, Galardo, to speak first, explaining that the current Spanish government is indeed legitimate, thus refuting the Portuguese representative's earlier speech in the Assembly, where he defined a legitimate government. Galardo stated, "A government is legitimate if it is elected in accordance with the legal principles followed by its people. In the case of the Spanish Republic, the current government has fulfilled all constitutional duties, attended Parliament, and received its confidence. Is this not a legitimate government?" He added that Spain's view of a legitimate government is consistent with the principles upon which the League of Nations is based. Finally, he said, "Some countries, though friends of Spain, have adopted a neutral policy, treating the Spanish rebels and the legitimate government as equals. How can this be?" After his speech, the representatives of Ecuador, Chaldumbide, and Peru, Tudela, delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Chairman Lamas announced the end of the debate. The Assembly then passed a report stipulating that non-League of Nations member states' citizens are eligible for election as judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. It also passed a resolution proposed by the Executive Council, approving the increase of non-permanent members of the Executive Council from nine to eleven, with one seat given to China.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council previously formed a three-person committee to resolve the dispute in the Free City of Danzig. The committee was originally composed of representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and Portugal. After the current Executive Council meeting, Portugal's term as a member of the Executive Council expired, so Sweden, which was newly elected as a member, took its place. Tonight, the three-person committee, composed of British, French, and Swedish Foreign Ministers Eden, Delbos, and Sandler, met to discuss the situation in the Free City of Danzig. Polish Foreign Minister Beck, with the qualification of being entrusted by the Executive Council to supervise the Free City government, attended the meeting. After discussion, it was decided that Eden would draft a report to be submitted for discussion at the Executive Council's public meeting next Monday. It is reported that the report suggests that Lester should remain as the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig until a successor is appointed. Currently, Lester will take a leave of absence for a few weeks and return to Danzig to resume his duties after the vacation. In addition, at the Executive Council meeting next Monday, Poland will be formally entrusted to supervise in order to normalize the relationship between Danzig and the League of Nations.

<p>(Geneva) French Premier Léon Blum, after arriving in Geneva this morning, met separately with British Foreign Secretary Eden, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in the afternoon. Tomorrow, he will meet with Polish Foreign Minister Beck and is scheduled to return to Paris the day after tomorrow, Sunday. It is reported that when Léon Blum met with Eden, they discussed three issues: first, whether Anglo-French trade relations could be improved after the devaluation of the French currency; second, the revision of the League of Nations Covenant; and third, the Locarno Five-Nation Conference. According to well-informed sources, the Locarno Five-Nation Conference is unlikely to be convened in the immediate future because there has not been sufficient diplomatic preparation so far. When Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu met with Premier Léon Blum, he repeatedly reaffirmed Romania's friendship with France and jointly discussed the political and economic issues of the Little Entente countries. Furthermore, according to the Havas correspondent, when Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with Léon Blum, he repeatedly pointed out that Germany's recent uncompromising attitude towards the Soviet Union has made the Soviet Union extremely uneasy. Therefore, he advocated that all countries that want to safeguard the territorial status quo in Europe should cooperate more closely. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e55">British Chancellor's Speech: Determination to Expand Armaments; States Air Force is Elite and Invincible; Conservative Party Opposes Foreign Secretary's Overseas Negotiations <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor Chamberlain delivered a lengthy speech at the Maelmon Conservative Party Congress today, stating that the British government is proceeding with the rearmament plan, regardless of opposition from any party. Britain's efforts in the disarmament movement are obvious to the world, but because no one has followed Britain's lead, if we do not take steps to make up for our shortcomings, we fear we will not be able to fulfill our responsibilities. Chamberlain continued, "Once the rearmament program is complete, we will once again have a strong navy that can fully protect all lines of communication. Although the army's size cannot be compared with the large-scale conscription of European countries, it will be equipped with the latest weapons and various mechanization methods. At that time, the air force will be second to none in terms of speed, long endurance, engine power, quality, and personnel."</p>
<p>Chamberlain continued, "The development of the world's aviation industry has deprived Britain of some of the benefits of being an island nation. The government has never forgotten the dangers that its people face in times of war, but we must not forget that other countries are far more concerned about such possibilities than we British are. I believe that our air force is the most formidable force in war, so I support its establishment with great faith and enthusiasm, because the world knows that the British air force will never be used for unprovoked wars of aggression."</p>
<p>Chamberlain solemnly declared that the main purpose and desire of the government is to maintain peace. It does not want to seize the territory of others, nor does it intend to interfere in the internal affairs of any other country. The dangers of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries can be seen in the cruelty of the events in Spain. However, thanks to the courageous initiative of French Premier Blum and the support of Britain, the whole of Europe may be divided into two opposing camps. Chamberlain warmly welcomed the establishment of the London International Committee. The British government believes that the establishment of regional agreements within the League of Nations Covenant will materially consolidate the prospect of world peace, because under this agreement, countries with major interests can mutually guarantee to resolve well-known dispute areas. The British government intends to negotiate a public agreement with Western Europe.</p>
<p>Referring to the British Empire, Chamberlain stated that even if there are various difficulties in the interpretation of the Ottawa Agreement, there are indeed considerable provisions in it so that both parties can begin to exchange views. Chamberlain believes that the harmony of opinions among the governments of the various autonomous territories and the British Imperial government on various common interests, foreign policy, defense, and trade has never been greater than in the four years since the Ottawa Treaty was signed. Chamberlain then declared that Prime Minister Baldwin hopes to be able to meet all the heavy responsibilities of the present when Parliament reopens.</p>
<p>Before the adjournment, a resolution was passed urging the government to change its policy of successive foreign ministers usurping the responsibilities of competent ambassadors for the sake of world peace. The motion criticized the impropriety of the foreign minister personally going abroad to discuss international affairs and solemnly declared that this proposal was not aimed at Foreign Secretary Eden personally. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Labor Party Executive Committee held a meeting in Edinburgh City yesterday, and after discussing it all day, it finally passed a resolution, stating that "the current government is unable to fulfill the promises it has made to maintain peace, and the Party can only continue to work hard to impeach it and promote the Party's positive international policy with all its strength so as to regain power."

<p>(Paris) The government previously imposed additional taxes on imported goods from certain countries due to the imbalance of foreign exchange rates in order to remedy the situation. Now, because the devaluation policy of the French franc has taken effect, it issued an order this morning stipulating that the additional taxes should be reduced or abolished from October 10th. Among them, the additional taxes on goods imported from China and Japan have been reduced from 15% to 10%. The additional taxes on goods from Australia, Egypt, India, New Zealand, Paraguay, Argentina, and the Union of South Africa have been completely abolished. In addition, the government has issued several orders to reduce tariffs in order to gradually achieve a free trade policy, namely (1) raw materials not subject to import quotas are reduced by 20%, semi-finished products are reduced by 17%, and finished products are reduced by 15%; (2) all goods within import quotas are reduced by 20%; (3) a special tariff committee is established to study (a) methods for further reducing tariffs, and (b) abolishing import quotas when prices rise excessively.

<p>(Vienna) The leader of the Vienna Province Patriotic Home Guard was originally Chief of the former Ministry of Interior, Major Fey. After Fey left office, he was replaced by Prince Starhemberg, former cabinet adviser. The group recently requested that Major Fey be reinstated, which led to internal disputes. The leaders of various branches across the country held a meeting yesterday to discuss the matter. The members resolved unanimously to expel Major Fey and Vienna Deputy Mayor Rahl from the group and issued a public statement in the evening explaining the reasons for this decision, stating that Major Fey and Rahl stood in opposition within the Patriotic Home Guard, and Major Fey was particularly concerned with undermining the unity of the group, and Fey's position when former Prime Minister Dollfuss was murdered on July 25th of the previous year was also vague and has always been a source of suspicion. This is the reason for the expulsion of Fey and Rahl. In addition, Prince Starhemberg has also issued a decree to all members, especially members of the Vienna Province branch, forbidding them from associating with Major Fey, otherwise they will be expelled. Fey also plans to expel Prince Starhemberg from the Vienna Province branch in retaliation. It is now known that the Patriotic Home Guard discussed the murder of former Prime Minister Dollfuss when it met yesterday. Therefore, the above public statement mentioned this matter, but at the last minute, the newspapers in the capital received an order from the police authorities not to reprint it. From this point of view, Chancellor Schuschnigg seems to be not standing idly by in the dispute between Starhemberg and Fey. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) The hotels, taverns, and cafes in this city went on strike this morning. On the Champs-Élysées and other major streets, most of the shops have joined the strike, except for a few shops where labor and management have reached an agreement. When the market opened this morning, the tables and chairs in front of the taverns and cafes were moved away. In front of most hotels in the central district, there were pickets stationed to monitor. However, some hotel authorities took precautions in advance, so they were not affected by the strike. Generally, the striking waiters stayed put, and the police went to the Champs-Élysées first to persuade them to withdraw, and they all expressed obedience and there were no disturbances. The police are now going to other areas to persuade them. The government previously made a promise in the Senate that when striking workers stay in the workplace, it must do its best to stop them. Premier Léon Blum also reiterated this when debating the new currency bill in the House of Representatives. This is the first time that the above promise has been put into practice.

<h3 id="e62">The Highest Limit of Diplomatic Efforts <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>For over a month, the diplomatic relations between China and Japan have been trending towards tension step by step, reaching the most serious stage in the recent ten days or so. The creation of this situation is superficially due to two reasons. The first is the so-called "unfortunate incidents" that occurred successively in Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and Shanghai. The Japanese side did not take a calm attitude to investigate the fundamental causes, but instead fueled the flames, using them to coerce the Chinese authorities, resulting in an unexpectedly tense situation. The second is the negotiations in Nanjing between our Foreign Minister Zhang and Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe. Due to the disparity of opinions, they could not progress smoothly, and the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side transmitted by Reuters and the hard-line attitude of Tokyo shown by the Domei News Agency have all made the Chinese people feel angry and uneasy. These two situations, especially the Japanese side's deliberate ostentation and fierce stimulation after the Hongkou incident, have created an extraordinary atmosphere, making us feel that the "adjustment" of Sino-Japanese relations has indeed reached a critical juncture on the diplomatic path.</p>
<p>However, at such a serious juncture, according to the verbal statements of the Japanese side, they have not yet abandoned the determination to take the diplomatic route. A telegram from Tokyo yesterday reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched the Director of the East Asia Bureau, Kuwajima, to China with a concrete proposal decided by the three-ministry conference to convey it to Ambassador Kawagoe, preparing to reopen negotiations. It seems that in the very bleak current situation, there is still a glimmer of hope for a "turn for the better." However, we must point out that we do not have excessive illusions about this statement from the Japanese side. We will certainly not refuse to resolve Sino-Japanese problems through diplomatic channels, but "adjusting" the relations between the two countries diplomatically must follow the proper path and must not violate the basic stance of an independent country. Leaving these two points means exceeding the highest limit of diplomatic efforts. We absolutely cannot tolerate it. We would like to take advantage of the current serious moment to explain our views on diplomacy.</p>
<p>First, fundamentally, we should recognize that the abnormality of Sino-Japanese relations began at least in 1931, at the time of the "September 18th Incident," and was definitely not caused by some recent incidents. The occupation of many places such as the three eastern provinces, Rehe, eastern Hebei, and northern Chahar, the bombing of the flourishing city of Shanghai, the carrying out of the puppet autonomy movement, and the rampant armed smuggling, these major incidents are truly "incomparable" when compared with some recent incidents. The accounts should be settled from the beginning. In the current diplomatic negotiations, we must make a whole clearance with the other side for the damage to our country's territorial sovereignty over the past five years.</p>
<p>Second, in the course of the abnormality of Sino-Japanese relations over the past five years, we have seen that the Japanese side only has force and no diplomacy towards China. If there is any, it is diplomacy under the bayonet. Therefore, we believe that the negotiations on the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement, the Tanggu Truce, and the He-Umezu Agreement were not conducted under normal diplomacy. Now, if the Japanese side is indeed sincere in conducting negotiations through proper diplomatic channels, we should naturally demand the abolition of these agreements. Moreover, in the past, the Japanese side often deliberately targeted local authorities in many negotiations with our country, failing to follow the normal diplomatic channels. At present, the Japanese side insists on abandoning the proper channel of negotiating with Foreign Minister Zhang and demands so-called "direct" negotiations with President Jiang of the Executive Yuan. It is even more evident that the arrogant attitude of a group of Japanese military officers last year has not changed to this day. Such means of not following the normal diplomatic track will certainly not bring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations into the proper path.</p>
<p>Third, the demands made by the Japanese side in the Nanjing negotiations have been published by Reuters based on news from the Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun," namely the four items regarding the "autonomy" of the five provinces in North China, the Sino-Japanese transport agreement, the further reduction of Chinese tariffs on Japanese goods, and the use of Japanese advisors as much as possible. The essence of these four demands is to completely turn China into a colony of Japan. However, the other day, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amau, suddenly published an article attacking Reuters, calling such news "fantastic propaganda." True, although we dare not determine whether these demands are true, we dare to assert that these demands are not only fantastic but also utterly absurd. All demands that harm China's territorial sovereignty are absurd "fantasies" that exceed the highest limit of Sino-Japanese diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, we should also frankly state that the Chinese people do not have any excessive "illusions" about Japan. We only have one legitimate demand, which is to restore our territory and sovereignty. In order to protect China's territory and sovereignty, we are not afraid of any sacrifice.</p>

<p>Burgos - General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish rebel forces, today announced the organization of the new government via radio from here to the world, stating that Spain will establish a new political situation based on dictatorship. It will comprehensively consider traditional customs, national welfare, national unity, and historical evolution. The government will also advocate Catholicism, give preferential treatment to countries with the same language and culture, and maintain friendly relations with all countries, except Soviet Russia. After Franco's speech, he immediately ordered the implementation of a dictatorship and the establishment of a provisional State Council. The State Council will be composed of the Chairman of the Technical Committee, the Governors of the recovered provinces, the Director of the Government Secretariat, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Public Works, and the Minister of Transportation. Their names have not yet been announced. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Burgos - Following his inauguration yesterday, General Franco, head of the National Army Government, immediately convened a State Council meeting. After the meeting, he issued an order to regulate the organization and powers of the National Army Government. It stated that the National Army Government would establish a State Council, under which would be seven specialized committees: (1) Finance Committee, (2) Justice Committee, (3) Industry and Commerce Committee, (4) Agriculture Committee, (5) Labor Committee, (6) Education Committee, and (7) Construction Committee. In addition, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be established to oversee propaganda matters. All laws and decrees must be reviewed by the respective specialized committees and then submitted to the head of the National Army Government through the State Council for approval before taking effect. The governors of the provinces currently controlled by the National Army have also been appointed by General Franco. General Cabanellas, former Chairman of the Military Government, has been appointed Inspector General of Army Education, General Mola has been reappointed Commander of the Northern Front, and General Dávila has been promoted to Commander of the Southern Front.

<p>Lisbon - General Franco, commander of the Spanish rebel forces, today issued a declaration to the Spanish people, stating that the new Spain will follow Portugal's example and implement a corporatist system. He absolutely guaranteed to secure work for all the people, no longer subject to the shackles of capitalism, and would stipulate a minimum wage. All the rights previously obtained by workers will be respected, but the general "parasites" in society will be eliminated. As for the Roman Catholic Church, it will establish harmonious coordination with the government. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Burgos - Since being elected as "Head of State of Spain," General Francisco Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, will set up his office in the old Provincial Council in the city of Burgos. Last night, after taking office, General Franco broadcast a speech on the Castile radio station, expressing his political views. According to the political views of the Spanish government army, it can be divided into two factions: one faction is the Carlist royalists who support the Carlos dynasty (note: Prince Carlos, the heir to the Carlos dynasty, died in a car accident in Vienna a few days ago), advocating the restoration of autocratic monarchy. Whether the king represents divine power is yet to be determined. In terms of social organization, they advocate a family system. This faction, led by Fal Conde, is smaller in number but has a strong cohesion. The other faction is the Falangist fascists belonging to the Falange Española de las JONS. This faction's political program was drafted by the son of the former dictator Rivera, the leader of the Falange, and is based on the Italian fascist system, advocating the establishment of a vocational group state. The political views of these two factions often conflict. The political program announced by General Franco this time is a compromise between the views of the two factions. In the first half of his speech, he advocated that the government adopt an authoritarian system centered on the military. Although local autonomy will be respected, it will be limited to not weakening national power. As for the question of whether to restore the monarchy, it will be decided by the people through vocational group organizations in the future. This proposition is obviously intended to satisfy the Carlist royalists. However, in the second half of his speech, he advocated protecting the interests of workers, preventing excessive capitalism, workers should receive fair remuneration, and participate in profit sharing, but must cooperate loyally with the "wealthy." All Spaniards should work according to their abilities, and all parasitic classes are not tolerated by the new government. All of the above is obviously to satisfy the requirements of the Fascist Party. In addition, whether Catholicism should become the state religion according to the royalist proposal, Franco did not reveal in his speech. He only stated that the government should decide its attitude towards the Catholic Church based on the religious situation of the majority of the Spanish people. Regarding the land issue, Franco only stated that the new government should protect family hereditary property, improve land use, and ensure fair remuneration for agricultural products. Finally, General Franco said that Spain is willing to cooperate with the people of all countries in harmony, but refuses to cooperate with countries that adopt a communist system. As for the people of South American countries with the same language and culture as Spain, the new government should especially find ways to maintain closer spiritual and material relations with the Spanish people.

<p>(Geneva) - The Spanish delegation to the League of Nations also released several documents last night to prove that Italy and Germany have repeatedly violated the non-intervention agreement in the civil war. (1) The German cargo ship "Chevalier," ostensibly carrying coal, was transported to the international neutral port of Tangier in Africa, but in fact, the coal was hiding munitions, which had arrived at the port of Melilla (rebel base in Spanish Morocco) on the 29th of last month. (2) Italy supplied the rebels with poison gas and arms on the 27th of last month. (3) On the same day, twelve German giant bombers were transported to the port of Tangier and were immediately deployed, carrying several rebels from Tetouan, Morocco, to Seville in mainland Spain. (4) The Italian gunboat "Ariaconda" departed from Trieste and arrived near the port of Tetouan on the 12th of last month, immediately unloading poison gas, aircraft, bombs and munitions to supply the rebels. The above are only the main points; there are countless others. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>(New York) - Literary magazines today released another public opinion poll on the presidential election. President Roosevelt received slightly more votes than Republican presidential candidate Landon.

Roosevelt had an advantage in 111 election districts in the South, including Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. Compared with the Republican and Democratic parties, the votes received by candidates from smaller parties were insignificant. Union Party candidate Lemke received a total of 29,038 votes, Socialist Party candidate Thomas received 3,343 votes, and Communist Party candidate Browder received only 1,523 votes.

<h3 id="e70">Tianjin Municipality Begins Collecting Income Tax; Banks Have Not Received Detailed Procedures; Municipal Agencies Start Collection as Scheduled <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The implementation of the income tax here can be described in three parts. Regarding the collection of income tax on interest from bonds and deposits by the three major banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank) and other banks, money shops, and silver firms, the Central Bank had only received the Ministry of Finance's general tax collection outline as of the 1st. The detailed implementation rules had not yet been received. Other banks had not received instructions from their Shanghai headquarters, so all procedures were unclear. Li Da, the former manager of the Central Bank in Tianjin, was transferred to Shanghai. Before receiving the transfer order, he was entrusted by the Tianjin banks and money shops to go to Shanghai to negotiate. However, the transfer order was recently announced, and his successor, Bian Chucheng, has not yet taken office. It seems that no one is responsible in the banking sector. However, because the Ministry of Finance's "Income Tax Collection Guidelines" contains four rules, each bank has an absolute obligation and cannot delay. Therefore, on the 1st, they sent telegrams one after another, requesting their Shanghai headquarters to send the procedures as soon as possible to facilitate the start. It is rumored that the Ministry of Finance will send personnel north to supervise implementation within the next week. According to the banking community, it is necessary to clearly understand how the tax payments will be remitted after the income tax is collected so that the process will not be delayed. The issue of clearing deposits and bond interest is not a problem, as each bank has monthly settlements. Although the procedures are cumbersome, there are no major difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of income tax from civil servants, the municipal government ordered all its subordinate agencies on September 28 to pay the tax on October 1 in accordance with the regulations issued by the central government. It would be deducted from their salaries each month when they were paid by the heads of the respective agencies. Ma Yanzhong, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government, also stated that the central government's intention to collect income tax is upright, and the people should bear it so that small amounts can be collected into large amounts to help the national treasury. The Tianjin Municipal Government will implement it as scheduled without any difficulty. The municipality has been collecting income donations for many years. After the income tax is collected, the donation will be stopped at the same time. However, it is difficult to guarantee that agencies outside the municipal government will comply as scheduled.</p>
<p>Regarding free professional groups, most of them are still waiting, as they do not fully understand this move. The supervision and promotion of the official is more important. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has been greatly affected by commercial depression and smuggling, has been suffering from poor returns in all industries. Based on the early requests of more than 90 trade associations, it forwarded a request to the Ministry of Finance to postpone the tax collection. The Ministry of Finance has not yet replied. Because tax collection is starting, the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various trade associations on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss how to proceed. On the morning of the 5th, another meeting of the Tianjin Municipal Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee will be convened, with the results of the 2nd day's meeting as the purpose of discussion. It will be submitted to the central government again, urging it to understand the desolation of North China's commerce and the hardship of the merchants, and to provide consideration, exempting them from the immediate tax collection. It would not be too late to start collecting when the market is slightly more active. In addition, various groups located in the concessions are protected by special forces and have not paid attention to this matter at all, so promotion is even more impossible. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Guangdong Merchants Appeal for the Maintenance of Previously Suspended Banknotes; Former Provincial Bank Notes and Old Central 10 Yuan Notes; Total Amount of Suspended Banknotes is Approximately 20 Million Yuan <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong merchants recently learned that the government will issue 120 million yuan of public bonds to reorganize Guangdong's finances, and Zhong E was sent south to prepare for the establishment of a branch of the Central Bank in Guangdong. A preparatory office has recently been established, and the branch address has been selected in the Thirteenth Hongs in Xiguan. This shows that the central government has concrete measures to reorganize Guangdong's finances and currency system. However, it was found that when the Central Bank was previously established in Guangdong, it issued a 10-yuan banknote in Guangdong. After the Central Bank moved north, it stopped redeeming it. The number of Central Bank banknotes that stopped redemption and remained in the Guangdong market was very large. So far, it has only become a commodity. Because of the suspension of redemption, its value is only 60-70% of the current Guangdong silver coins. (That is, 10 yuan of Central Bank banknotes that stopped redemption are worth 6-7 yuan of silver. However, the market price is different, and it has recently been higher than before.) Merchants who hold these banknotes have suffered great losses. Therefore, various firms jointly wrote to the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, forwarding a request to the government authorities to maintain them. Taking advantage of this period of reorganizing Guangdong's currency system, they should quickly recover the Central Bank banknotes that have stopped redemption at full value. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that this move has a great impact on the financial circulation of merchants, and especially proposed it for discussion at the 14th meeting on the 29th. It was then decided to forward the joint request of the city's velvet money industry and other five trade associations to the government to recover the suspended banknotes in Guangdong Province at full value as soon as possible. The details of the case are as follows: (1) The old Guangdong Provincial Bank banknotes were issued by Sun Yat-sen when he returned to Guangdong to govern in December 15th of the Republic of China's 9th year. On May 5th of the 10th year, after Sun Yat-sen took the position of Extraordinary President, he led his troops on the Northern Expedition. Due to the huge military expenses, more than 17 million yuan was misappropriated from the bank. The bank's fund was empty, and a run occurred. On February 8th of the 12th year, it was announced that it would stop circulation. In March of the same year, the Grand Marshal ordered the Finance Department to set up a banknote clearing office to engage in clearing. By September, he repeatedly ordered the former Chief of Finance of the Grand Marshal's Headquarters, Ye Gongchuo, and the Governor of Guangdong Province, Xu Shaozhen, Liao Zhongkai, and others to try to maintain it. After the establishment of the National Government, the Minister of Finance, Song, issued a statement when clearing the Bank of China banknotes, stating that he would continue to clear the Guangdong Bank banknotes of the provincial bank. Merchants were deeply hopeful, but because the political situation was not yet unified, it has not been implemented. (2) The old 10-yuan banknotes of Guangdong Bank were issued after the reorganization of the Central Bank in the 18th year. In April of the 20th year, they were suspended due to political changes. In January of the 20th year, the provincial government reorganized the bank into Guangdong Provincial Bank, and successively recovered various Bank of China banknotes. Only this 10-yuan banknote remains, because the number of issues is relatively large, and it has not been recovered yet. Now that the Guangdong situation has been stabilized, the above-mentioned two types of suspended banknotes are only more than 20 million yuan. The government can announce their maintenance on a specific day. However, merchants have been waiting quietly until now, and have not heard of any practical measures. Therefore, they especially described the past losses of the merchants and appealed for the forwarding of the request to the authorities to quickly provide maintenance and relief. (September 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Recent Developments in Sichuan Highways <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Sichuan's highway trunk lines, whether completed, uncompleted, or under planning, collectively encompass the routes of Sichuan-Guizhou, Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Hunan, Sichuan-Hubei, Sichuan-Xikang, Sichuan-Gansu, Sichuan-Qinghai, the Central Route of Sichuan-Yunnan, the Eastern Route of Sichuan-Yunnan, and the Western Route of Sichuan-Yunnan. All ten major trunk lines are centered in Chengdu. The recent conditions of the completed routes, the progress of the uncompleted routes, and a summary of the planned routes under preparation are described separately below.</p>
<p>A. Completed Trunk Lines:</p>
<p>(1) Sichuan-Guizhou Route: Starting from the Niushikou Station outside the East Gate of Chengdu, passing through Chongqing to the Chongxi River at the border of Sichuan and Guizhou, this is the Sichuan section of the route. From the Chongxi River, it passes through Songkan, Tongzi, and Zunyi, directly reaching Guiyang, which is the Guizhou section of the route. The entire route is 979 kilometers long. The entire road is now open to traffic. It takes one and a half days to travel from Chengdu to Chongqing, and one day from Chongqing to Songkan. The operation of vehicles and business are entirely managed by the Sichuan Highway Bureau, eliminating the various malpractices of private car companies in the past. Travelers praise the convenience. Recently, the Highway Bureau conducted a major autumn review of the Sichuan-Guizhou route to inspect the business conditions along the route, the status of vehicles, the suitability of station setups, and whether station staff are competent. The review was led by Bureau Chief Wei Junfan and Advisor Xu Xingcheng, along with the heads of various departments and sections of the bureau. They departed from Chengdu by car on September 26th. Lei Baohua, Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, who was in Chengdu on official business, also accompanied the inspection. The group was scheduled to return to Chengdu on October 5th. The trip was divided into four groups. The first group, which departed on the 26th, included Central News Agency reporter Huang Jingnan. They arrived in Chongqing on the 27th. The remaining three groups departed over the following four days. After gathering in Chongqing, they proceeded together to Songkan, which was the final destination of the inspection. Director Wei scheduled a meeting on the 28th to address the staff stationed in Chongqing. According to Wei, the inspection results along the way were very good, but a final evaluation would be made after the second group completed its review.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan-Shaanxi Route: Starting from the Boji Street Station outside the North Gate of Chengdu, passing through Xindu, Guanghan, Deyang, Luojiang, Mianyang, Zitong, Jiange, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, and ending in Ningqiang, Shaanxi Province, the entire route is 412 kilometers long. The section from Chengdu to Mianyang was built in the past, but the work was perfunctory, and the roadbed deteriorated early. From October 1935 to February 1936, construction was carried out to reorganize and complete the section, making it relatively smooth. The construction of the section from Mianyang to Ningqiang was extremely difficult, with a budget of 1,645,000 yuan allocated from the Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds by the Field Headquarters. The entire route was completed by the end of May this year, and a trial opening to traffic was held on June 1st. The operation of vehicles and business are entirely managed by the Sichuan Highway Bureau. Regarding the joint operation agreement for the Sichuan-Shaanxi route, it was signed by Sichuan Highway Bureau Chief Wei Junfan on September 17th during a trip to Shaanxi, with Zeng Xiangwu, Director of the Northwest National Highway Administration. It is expected to be officially opened to traffic in early November. Currently, north of Jiange in Sichuan Province, the roadbed has not been properly repaired, making driving extremely difficult. In addition, banditry is rampant in Mianyang, Luojiang, Zitong, and other counties, and robberies of cars occur frequently. As a result, the automobile business performance on this route is far less than that of the Chengdu-Chongqing section of the Sichuan-Guizhou route.</p>
<p>B. Uncompleted Trunk Lines:</p>
<p>(1) Sichuan-Hunan Route: Starting from Gongjiang on the Sichuan-Guizhou route, passing through Nanchuan, Pengshui, Qianjiang, Youyang, and Xiushan, and ending at Chashan Town at the border of Sichuan and Hunan, the route is 704 kilometers long. Qijiang County started construction at the end of November last year, and the entire line started construction at the end of January this year. The total construction cost is estimated at over 4,346,000 yuan, allocated from the Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds by the Field Headquarters. The progress of the entire route's work has been quite slow. As of the end of August, the road surface completion rate was 24% for the Qijiang to Pengshui section and 10% for the Qianjiang to Xiushan section. The Military Affairs Commission's Field Headquarters specifically instructed the Sichuan Provincial Government to issue orders to the Highway Bureau and the county governments along the Sichuan-Hunan route, using extremely stern language, stating that "The Hunan section of the Sichuan-Hunan highway has been completely opened to traffic by the end of August. The Sichuan section is hereby ordered to be fully open to traffic by the end of October, without further delay. The provincial government must strictly order the county governments along the route to comply diligently and intensify their work. Any delay will be severely punished without leniency." The Hunan section of this route starts from the aforementioned Chashan Town, passes through Yongshui, Qiancheng, and Luxi, and ends at Shaojiwan, connecting to the completed Xiang-Qian highway, directly reaching Changsha. This section is 200 kilometers long, which is two-thirds shorter than the Sichuan section, hence the rapid opening to traffic.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan-Hubei Route: This route starts from the Jianyang Station on the Chengdu-Chongqing section of the Sichuan-Guizhou route, passes through Lezhi, Suining, Pengxi, Nanchong, Yuechi, Guang'an, Qu County, Dazhu, Liangshan, and Wanxian, crosses the Yangtze River, and reaches Lichuan County in Hubei Province. The entire route is 809 kilometers long. The Jian-Qu section, 470 kilometers long, is open to traffic. The section from Qu County to the Dazhu Watershed, 187 kilometers long, has 30% of the road surface completed as of the end of August, while the remaining stone and bridge culvert projects have been completed. The section from Wanxian across the Yangtze River to Lichuan in Hubei Province has not yet started construction. It is reported that the Highway Supervision Office of the Field Headquarters has recently decided to build only to Wanxian and to open another route from Qianjiang Station on the Sichuan-Hunan route to Xianfeng in Hubei Province, 25 kilometers long, to connect with the highway from Xianfeng to Badong.</p>
<p>(3) Sichuan-Xikang Route: Starting from the station outside the South Gate of Chengdu, passing through Shuangliu, Xinjin, Qionglai, Mingshan, Ya'an, Tianquan, Luding, and ending in Kangding (Dajianlu) in Xikang, the entire route is 373 kilometers long. The Chengdu-Ya'an section, 173 kilometers long, was built in the past and is already open to traffic. The Ya'an to Kangding section has steep mountains and is difficult to construct. Although construction has started, it is feared that it will be difficult to complete within the year.</p>
<p>C. Planned Trunk Lines:</p>
<p>(1) Sichuan-Gansu Route: According to the Highway Bureau's plan, it is proposed to start from the Zhaohua Station on the Sichuan-Shaanxi route, pass through Baoningyuan, and reach Bikou in Gansu. The entire route is 100 kilometers long, which is very short. However, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Langzhong, and other places have not yet recovered from bandit disturbances, making it difficult to recruit labor and soldiers. Troops passing through often engage in forced conscription. The date of construction of this route is still far off.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan-Qinghai Route: Also one of the planned trunk lines, it is proposed to start from Mianyang Station on the Sichuan-Shaanxi route, pass through Zhangming, Jiangyou, Pingwu, Songpan, and enter Qinghai at Suogezang Temple. The entire route is 552 kilometers long. Currently, only the 53-kilometer road from Mianyang to Jiangyou has been built. However, bandits along the way are rampant and unscrupulous, and car drivers are wary, and passengers dare not take risks, all detouring. The section from Jiangyou to Suogezang Temple has not yet been surveyed, and it is unknown when construction will begin.</p>
<p>(3) Central Route of Sichuan-Yunnan: According to the highway plan for the trunk line from Sichuan to Yunnan, it is proposed to build three routes: central, eastern, and western. The construction cost is estimated to require more than 6,600,000 yuan, and a request has been submitted to the Field Headquarters for allocation from the construction public bonds. First, the central route plan is described: starting from Xinjin County on the Sichuan-Xikang route, reaching Pengshan, Meishan, Jiajiang, Leshan, Jianwei, and Pingshan, and reaching Yibin at the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, the entire route is 320 kilometers long. The section from Xinjin to Wutongqiao in Jianwei, 142 kilometers long, and the section from Jianwei to Qingshui Creek, 15 kilometers long, were built early. The remaining sections have not yet been built.</p>
<p>(4) Eastern Route of Sichuan-Yunnan: Starting from Longchang, passing through Luxian, Naxi, Xuyong, and reaching Chishui River at the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, the entire route is 250 kilometers long. Currently, only the section from Xuyong to Jiangmenchang, 40 kilometers long, has been completed. The rest is under survey.</p>
<p>(5) Western Route of Sichuan-Yunnan: Starting from Luding on the Sichuan-Xikang route, passing through Mianning, Xichang, and Huili, and reaching Pulong Town, the entire route is 600 kilometers long. No survey has been conducted yet. In total, the three Sichuan-Yunnan routes have no significant progress. Recently, the entire Yunnan-Guizhou highway has been completed, with traffic from Kunming to Guiyang, and then from Guiyang to Chongqing, indirectly benefiting Sichuan-Yunnan transportation, which is also of great importance. In mid-September, Qiu Chuanmeng, Secretary of the Highway Office of the Field Headquarters, and 10 others were sent to test drive, departing from Guiyang and arriving in Kunming in three days. They then discussed joint operations with the Yunnan Highway Bureau, intending to imitate the methods of the five provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and establish regulations for joint automobile transportation in the five provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi to jointly promote development. The completion of the Yunnan-Guizhou highway not only facilitates the transportation of passengers and goods between Sichuan and Yunnan but also forms a transportation network for the five southwestern provinces, which is sufficient to open a new era in history. From Kunming to Panxian, transfer to Guiyang, reach Chongqing, and then connect to the Sichuan-Yunnan road to reach Changsha, which can be implemented within this year. The Field Headquarters is urging the Sichuan Provincial Government to complete the Sichuan-Hunan trunk line within a limited time for the sake of implementing the five-province joint transportation plan.</p>

<p>Establishment of a Land Ownership Representative Group</p>
<p>The original organization of the city and rural land owners in this county, called the Taxpayer Assembly (initially called the Land Ownership Association), is now proposed to be reorganized into the Land Ownership Association. Upon submission to the County Magistrate, it was approved to be renamed the Land Ownership Representative Group. On the afternoon of the second day at 2:00 PM, a general meeting of more than 270 owners and representatives from the city and countryside was convened. The presidium reported the purpose of reorganizing the Land Ownership Representative Group and then discussed and elected the representatives of the Representative Group, stipulating a quota of 27 people. In addition to the warehouse association, the relief agency, and the property management office as ex officio representatives, 13 people including Wu Boyin were elected from the city, and 11 people including Yan Kangbo were elected from the countryside, totaling 27 people to form the Land Ownership Representative Group. Subsequently, various proposals were discussed. Regarding the cases of reported wasteland in Xiangcheng and other places, it was decided to send 38 industry stalls to the countryside for investigation. Hereafter, the name of the Land Ownership Assembly will no longer be used internally or externally, but the name of the Land Ownership Representative Group will be used.</p>
<p>Morphine Criminals Escorted to Province for Trial</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau previously transferred two morphine traffickers, Zhang Boliang and Zhang Lansheng, who were seized by the Third Branch Bureau while operating outside. After interrogation, they were transferred to the County Government for review. The County Government, considering that the case involved trafficking in narcotics, which should be handled by military law, dispatched detectives yesterday (the 3rd) at 7:00 or 8:00 AM to escort the two criminals to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for trial.</p>

<p>Notorious Native Opium Trafficker Arrested</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM on the 30th of last month, the Shanghai-Xianghu train arrived in Nanxiang. Zhang Sanbao, a resident of Zhuangjiajing, Shanghai County, purchased 80 taels of Yunnan opium and 25 taels of Sichuan opium in Shanghai. His demeanor was flustered when he got off the train. Yang Yiwen, a patrol officer of the Second Branch Bureau of the town's Public Security Bureau, and others stepped forward to search and uncovered the contraband. He was brought to the bureau for interrogation and confessed to trafficking drugs. On the 1st of this month, Acting Director Qian prepared a document to report to the county for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Silk Cocoon Merchants Telegraph Province for Assistance</p>
<p>Chen Xiekun, Chairman of the Joint Association of Silk Cocoon Industry Associations of Jiangsu Province, Hua Shaochun, Chairman of the Silk Cocoon Industry Association of Wuxi, Qian Fenghao, Chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, and others stated that the autumn silkworms in this province suffered from poor development and reduced harvests because the seed acid immersion date was too early and coincided with adverse weather. The quality of cocoons varied greatly. The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association uniformly referred to the cocoons as being of excellent quality, regardless of their actual quality. Initially, the price of cocoons was set at 29 yuan per dan as a balancing standard, but later it was stipulated that the price per dan should not be lower than 29 yuan, otherwise, strict penalties would be imposed. Silk cocoon merchants engage in the silk cocoon business, hoping to win glory for China's foreign trade, which is not comparable to ordinary commercial activities for pure profit. Over the years, they have suffered huge losses due to the influence of overseas markets, and they are now bankrupt and struggling to survive. The cocoon price set by the Sericulture Improvement Association is appropriate, but whether the initially set balancing standard of 29 yuan or the later minimum price of 29 yuan is more appropriate is unclear. The government automatically changes orders in the morning and revokes them in the evening. Merchants have repeatedly telegraphed for relief, stating that they should consult widely. For the sake of the lifeline of silk farmers and silk merchants throughout Jiangsu Province, they specifically jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Sericulture Improvement Management Committee yesterday to request assistance.</p>
<p>Half-Decomposed Corpse Found Hanging in Yi County</p>
<p>On a cypress tree in the ancestral grave of Yu Lin's family on Dongguan Community Mountain in the middle section of Jin Yuan Road from Meiyuan to Xiaojishan in the Fourth District of the county, an unidentified male corpse was found hanging this morning. The corpse was wearing a white undershirt, and the head had become a skeleton with only a few strands of hair remaining. The muscles of the upper body, except for most of the rotted parts, had been air-dried. The lower half of the corpse, from the chest down, including both hands and the intestines and lungs inside the abdomen, had been eaten by wild animals. The two wrist bones protruded. There were many body fragments on the ground, along with a pair of twill cloth single shoes. There were many wild animal claw marks on the cypress tree. The sight was terrifying. It is expected that the corpse committed suicide more than a month ago. Shan Hongyuan, the head of the Nian San Yi Tu, learned of the situation and reported it to the local court, requesting an inquest. Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming, upon receiving the report, immediately took with him Coroner Wang Chengyi, Clerk Li Shixian, Bailiff Zhou Yizhu, Zhu Wancheng, and others, and went to the countryside by car for an inquest. The inquest determined that the corpse had indeed committed suicide before death. Since there were no family members, Tu was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Tax Police Officer Commits Suicide by Shooting Himself</p>
<p>Wang Changgui, a police officer of the Fourth Patrol Boat under the jurisdiction of the Third Squadron of the Sixth District of the Fifth Tax Police Corps of Jiangsu Province of the Ministry of Finance, stationed at Ziyang Academy in Huishan Town in this county, was 26 years old and a native of Taixing Coast Town. Because he was fond of prostitutes, he often frequented lower-class brothels and contracted syphilis. Recently, his lymph nodes had become severely inflamed, and his lower body had ulcerated. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he was in extreme pain. He suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. So, at about 12:00 noon yesterday, he took a rifle, loaded it with a bullet, took off the sock on his right foot, used a white cloth strip, tied one end to the big toe, and the other end to the trigger. The muzzle of the gun was aimed at his chest. He stepped on it with his foot, triggering the gun. With a loud bang, the bullet entered from the front of his heart and exited from the right side of his neck. He immediately died, lying in a pool of blood. Later, Li Jinsheng, a police officer on the same boat, learned of the incident and immediately reported it to Squadron Leader Zhang Xintao and sent a letter to the court for an inquest. Prosecutor Shen took the official to the scene and confirmed that the deceased Wang Changgui had indeed committed suicide with a rifle. He ordered the head of the Tu, Jiang Zixian, to prepare a coffin for burial and wait for his family to come to Wuxi to claim the coffin.</p>

The rumbling sound continued, and residents throughout the city were extremely alarmed at this time of perilous Sino-Japanese diplomacy. As a result, rumors spread throughout the day, and many were uneasy. It was not until the evening that the origin of the cannon fire was learned, saying that it came from the Langshan area opposite Fushan.

<p>Warehouse Robbed in Lücheng</p>
<p>The warehouse of the Lücheng Farmers' Bank in the eastern countryside of the county was robbed of 20 dan of white rice and 8 dan and 1 dou of wheat by thieves in the late night of the 12th of this month. After the bank discovered the incident, it immediately reported it to the Eighth Police Station and requested arrest and punishment. Upon receiving the report, Inspector He immediately ordered Cui Er, the night watchman of the town, and police officers to search for the suspects. They soon arrested suspect Li Xiaogen, who confessed that the case was committed by boatmen Sha Shouren and Li Changgen from Xinghua. However, their whereabouts are uncertain, but Li Changgen's brother-in-law, Wang Laoer (currently residing in Minghuang Town, Wujin), was arrested, and their residence can be learned from him. Inspector He, according to the confession, dispatched police to Wujin to investigate. Unexpectedly, the suspects' boats were docked in the Beidou River in Wujin. The First Police Station of the Wujin County Public Security Bureau detained them because their whereabouts were suspicious. The police officers of the Eighth Station also arrested a boat of Sha Shouren and learned of the above situation. They returned to the station to report. Inspector He immediately prepared a document to go to Wujin to bring the suspects. However, the Wujin Public Security Bureau refused to allow them to bring the suspects on the grounds that Sha Shouren and others had committed a robbery case in the county. The police officers then escorted Sha Shouren's boat and his wife, Gu, and four children, to Danyang and transferred them to the General Bureau for review.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Total Withdrawal of Japanese Soldiers Stationed Beyond Borders; Restored to the State of September 30th <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai had been intensifying their positions along North Szechuan Road since 4:20 AM on the 1st, adding checkpoints and installing barbed wire, creating a very tense situation. It is now learned that this situation was completely relaxed as of 4:20 AM yesterday, and the state of affairs has been restored to that of September 30th. In the past 48 hours, the tense situation caused public anxiety. According to the Japanese side, the 48-hour alert was purely due to the sentencing in the Zhongshan case, fearing unexpected events. Yesterday morning, reporters patrolled the North Szechuan Road area. "Except for five locations - the intersections of Kiangwan Road, Tihua Road, Sze Da Road, and Scott Road, the end of the road, and the Tientungan Railway Station - where four armed Japanese soldiers were stationed at each, the rest had been withdrawn to the military camp. Some of the military telephones that had been installed the day before had also been removed. At the intersections of Yongfeng Building, Chapoo Road, and Haining Road, although armored vehicles were still parked in front of the Japanese military outposts, they were no longer seen moving around. As for the urban areas, such as Hujia Wood Bridge, Tiantong Road Bridge, Linping Road Bridge, Qimei Road Bridge, Shajing Port Bridge, Bao'an Road, Jixiang Road intersection, Bao'an Road intersection, Qimei Road, Quanjia'an Road intersection, and the east end of Xiangde Road, where Japanese soldiers had been stationed in the past two days, they had also all been withdrawn as of yesterday morning. As a result, rumors in the city gradually subsided, and people's minds became more at ease. It is also learned that the situation of the Japanese troops in the Japanese brewery behind the Sixth Third Garden and in the Ouyang Road Japanese Elementary School remained the same. However, it is learned that a new watchtower has been built at the Japanese military outpost at 1097 Tihua Road.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Hongkou and Zhabei areas yesterday were generally more relaxed than the day before, and had largely returned to the state before September 30th. The Japanese military's expanded deployment was merely a show of force due to the Zhongshan Hide male case. Now that the case has been adjudicated and the Japanese side is satisfied, the New Voice News Agency reporter, while passing by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces headquarters on Jiangwan Road yesterday, saw red paper similar to slogans posted on the wall on the right side, with words such as "Zhongshan Hide male case adjudicated," seemingly an expression of satisfaction. The Japanese military's deployment in the concession areas, which began on the 1st, extended south from North Szechuan Road and Laobaidu Road to Suzhou Road and the Suzhou Creek bank. Except for the barbed wire at each key intersection, which was removed early in the morning the day before, the stationed posts were also completely withdrawn as of 4:30 AM yesterday. The area of patrol is still limited to Laobaidu Road; north of Laobaidu Road, it remains the same as usual. However, the number of posts and formations of skirmishers or vehicle patrols seems to have decreased as well. The same is true for the area around Wusong Road, Haining Road, and Peng Road. In Zhabei, the eastern part, such as East Sports Association Road, Ouyang Road, Sze Da Road, Xiangde Road, Scott Road, Qimei Road, Tihua Road, Baoxing Road, Kiangwan Road, Tiantong Road, Tiantong Road Bridge, Old Cigarette Bridge Road, Cigarette Bridge, and Shajing Port Road, where Japanese military posts were densely deployed the day before and the situation was quite serious, also tended to be calm yesterday. The Japanese military posts were also completely withdrawn at 4:30 AM yesterday morning. However, skirmishers or formations of vehicles were still patrolling. The western part, such as Jiangwan Road, Tongji Road, and Hengye Road, which had already been relatively peaceful the day before, became even better yesterday. However, at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road and in Hengye Road and other places, the Japanese military, under the pretext of protecting Japanese students, sent several posts around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, which were withdrawn around 8:30 AM; they went again at 11:30 AM and withdrew around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, after which they did not send any more. But like other places, there were still patrol teams coming and going. As for the open space at the end of Garden Street behind the Sixth Third Garden, when the reporter went there around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, he happened to see more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, divided into three or four teams, either scattered or gathered, or rising and falling, apparently drilling. The area around the Japanese cemetery at Eight Character Bridge was also very peaceful.</p>
<p>Chinese Suspected</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at 10:00 AM the day before (the 2nd), a Chinese man surnamed Liu, who had arrived in Shanghai from the interior, was detained by Japanese sailors at Gujia Wood Bridge in Zhabei and taken to the Naval Landing Forces headquarters. However, he was released shortly after. According to the Japanese sailors, the Chinese man had been staring at them incessantly, and they feared there was danger, so they detained him. However, according to Liu, he was detained while he and others were reading a notice from the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>German Detained</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at around 5:15 PM the day before (the 2nd), a German named Jordan, carrying a camera, was walking to the corner of Miller Road and Peng Road when he was about to photograph sailors unloading ammunition. Japanese sailors stationed on Miller Road saw him, immediately approached, surrounded him, and escorted him to the temporary defense post of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces on Miller Road. Those inside the defense post discussed for a long time. Jordan, unable to speak Japanese, did not say a word. Half an hour later, Jordan wanted to leave the defense post but was stopped by two sentries at the door. At this time, the Hongkou Police Station had already been informed, and several Western police sergeants arrived at the post by car, stating that Jordan had not taken any pictures. Thereupon, they handed Jordan over to them, and after a Western detective questioned him and clarified the situation, he was released.</p>
<p>American Reports</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the North China Daily News reporter, American Miss Meslin, who was detained by Japanese sailors at the Japanese Naval Landing Forces headquarters on Tuesday, has already reported in detail to the US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, yesterday. Gauss, after listening, said that he would continue to investigate the matter and was unable to say whether he would lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities. It is noted that Meslin, after returning to the North China Daily News office that day, immediately notified Gauss by telephone and went to the US Consulate General yesterday morning to report everything in detail.</p>
<p>Bullet Grazes Hotel</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, at around 4:30 PM the day before (the 2nd), a Japanese sailor who was off duty was walking on Nansun Road when, unexpectedly, a bullet from his rifle was discharged, grazing the roof of a tavern owned by an American named Alexander across the street. The owner had served in the European War for several years and strongly opposed Japanese sailors pointing their fingers at the triggers of their rifles when patrol teams passed in front of his tavern. Yesterday, after the stray bullet grazed the roof of his tavern, he was even more enraged, as his family was upstairs in the room at the time.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Demand</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Diplomatic Committee of the Japanese Residents Association has resolved to urge the Association to find ways to increase the number of Japanese plainclothes detectives in the Public Concession. As for the suggestion of appointing Japanese to be the chief detectives of the Tihua Road and Yangtzepoo Road police stations, it has been temporarily shelved pending further thorough investigation. It is noted that the Japanese Road Association also sent a letter to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, on September 28th, making the same request, stating that adopting this plan would increase the effectiveness of police protection.</p>
<p>War Insurance Prices Increase</p>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired with the insurance industry yesterday and learned the reason for the increase in war insurance prices. Since the Tianport case, the situation in this port has been serious. Although war insurance for the Zhabei district cannot be insured, the war insurance premium has increased from one yuan and several dimes per thousand yuan to seven yuan and fifty dimes. This is indeed true.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Market: Rice Prices Soar, but Rice Supply Remains Abundant <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagu News Agency, recently, residents of this city, in view of the increasingly serious situation between China and Japan, are purchasing grain in preparation for food and taking precautions, regardless of large or small households, to prevent any eventuality. Therefore, rice sales have increased sharply, and rice prices have risen by forty or fifty cents per picul since the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, there was still a tendency for prices to continue to rise in the market. The current price of first-grade white rice is eleven yuan and forty or fifty cents, new rice is about ten yuan and eight or nine cents to eleven yuan and one dime, second-grade rice is all within ten yuan, and the next grade is between eight and nine yuan.</p>
<p>River Rice Congestion</p>
<p>In the past week, the demand in Shanghai has surged. River rice from various areas in the interior, such as Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongli, Sijing, Kunshan, Zhangyan, Fengjing, Jiashan, Zhenze, Xitang, Lili, Qingpu, Liyang, Zhitang, and Shuangfeng, is being transported to Shanghai in large quantities. The rice industry wharves north and south of the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River are extremely congested with ships. The daily supply reaches more than 10,000 piculs, and the rice carried by each ship can be completely unloaded within two or three days.</p>
<p>Total Rice Stock</p>
<p>A reporter from the Dagu News Agency investigated the rice market yesterday morning. The total amount of rice in stock in the city is estimated to be more than 200,000 piculs of Kehsien rice and 130,000 to 40,000 piculs of new and old white rice produced in various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, totaling more than 360,000 piculs, which is sufficient for the city's residents to consume for more than a month. At present, the number of Kehsien rice transshipped from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other places to Shanghai is also very large, and the new late rice and new japonica rice in the country will soon be on the market one after another. There is absolutely no fear of food shortages in the country.</p>
<p>Japanese Purchasing Rice</p>
<p>As for the Japanese side, Mitsui &amp; Co. and Mitsubishi &amp; Co. have jointly formed a grain transportation company to purchase old rice and new japonica rice in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is reported that the first batch of goods has been loaded and exported, and they are still continuing to purchase and hoard. The Japanese purchase of our country's rice is undoubtedly for military preparations.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, led our World Games delegation and arrived in Shanghai by the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso at 1:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to welcome him included Li Dachao, the representative of Mayor Wu, Zhou Jue, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhinan, the secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Zhu Changnian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and many others such as Liu Yunfang and Fan Guang. Wang met with reporters in shifts on the ship and gave a speech, stating briefly: "I have been abroad for four months this time, first to the United States and then to Germany. There will be separate reports on the experience of participating in the World Games. Recently, the relationship between China and Japan has been quite tense. I had heard about it while in Europe, but not in great detail. The situation in Europe is that the entire continent is uneasy and restless due to the Spanish Civil War, so there is no time to look east. The only way out for our country at present is to unite, support the government, concentrate our strength, and unify our steps to seek the survival of our nation. This time, the Guangdong-Guangxi issue was resolved peacefully, and national unification was declared complete. European and American countries have greatly praised this. The relationship between China and the United States has always been friendly. As I have been ordered to be an envoy to the United States, I will naturally work hard to promote the friendship between China and the United States. I will be entering Beijing in a day or two to meet with Minister Zhang, ask for instructions on matters related to going abroad, and also intend to meet with President Jiang to ask for instructions on everything."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Xue Guangqian Talks About His Return from Overseas Studies: Various Countries Are Striving to Prepare for Wartime Economy; Our Country Should Start with Sound Organization <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Mr. Xue Guangqian went abroad in the spring of the year before last. He was sent by the former Rural Rehabilitation Committee of the Executive Yuan as a special commissioner to study rural economies in Europe. After arriving in Europe, Xue realized that while rural economy is indeed an important foundation for establishing a country, national defense economy is even more fundamental to establishing rural economy. Therefore, in addition to his research, he stayed in Italy and entered the Royal University of Rome to study national defense economy under the world-renowned financial scholar Mr. Stefanini for two years, gaining considerable experience. He was awarded a doctorate by the university and received much praise. Before returning to China, Xue also went to various European countries to investigate everything. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday with his wife on the Conte Rosso. The New Voice News Agency reporter, believing that national defense economy is important and that the number of people in our country studying this subject is still small, specifically sought an interview to inquire about everything. Mr. Xue replied,</p>
<p>"The scope of national defense economy is very broad. In short, in peacetime, it is nothing more than controlled economy, and in wartime, it is war economy. At present, the international situation is tense, and various countries are eager to prepare for war economy, fearing that they will be too late. Our country is facing national difficulties, and we should not ignore this. The preparation of various countries for war economy is the initial step of economic mobilization, and also the preparation for the transition from peacetime economy to war economy. The general principle is nothing more than seeking to suit and balance the supply and demand of national manpower, talent, and resources. Therefore, at present, countries are striving to increase the amount of female labor in terms of population and using railways to adjust the density of the population. In terms of finance and finance, they are preventing the escape of funds, controlling international exchange rates, issuing war bonds, and increasing taxes, etc. In terms of transportation and communication, they are striving to establish wireless communication networks, increase berths and docks, expand air traffic, and build wartime railways and highways. In terms of industry, they are striving for standardization, technicalization, and mechanization, using machines to replace labor and achieve mass production. In terms of agriculture, they are paying attention to the establishment of permanent profits, large-scale farming, and research on substitutes. In terms of resources, they are striving for the safety of resource areas, the acquisition of resource-supplying countries, and the storage and development of raw materials. In short, it is necessary to make the various parts of the peacetime economy form a new situation to adapt to the various changes that occur in wartime. At present, countries are working tirelessly on this kind of work, which is actually a declaration of preparedness for war.</p>
<p>For example, Italy's national economy, no matter how small a matter or thing, is controlled by the Ministry of Economic Cooperation, and everything is adapted to the dynamics of wartime. The reason why it can be like this is actually due to the strict organization of national industrial and commercial groups. The whole of Italy is organized by government-appointed personnel into 22 industrial cooperatives, bringing together consumers, sellers, producers, and even suppliers of raw materials to discuss and cooperate with each other to seek the average development of the industrial economy. There are also nine major trade associations for agriculture, industry, commerce, banking, insurance, and freelance professions, with separate organizations for labor and management to adjust the interests of labor and management and to seek the improvement of the overall national economy. And each group has designated cadres in economic mobilization to take charge of its affairs, closely liaise with the Ministry of Economic Cooperation, so that the government commands the whole country as one person, as easy as using an arm, and can allocate resources freely. Our country is in an unprecedented difficulty in history, with nine deaths and one life, cutting clothing and saving food, relying on our own efforts and regenerating ourselves. War economy cannot be formed overnight and must be prepared quickly in order to achieve something. And the most important thing for preparation is to</p>
<p>improve the organization, especially the organization of industrial and commercial groups, otherwise, people will be selfish and each will calculate for himself, and everything will be difficult to concentrate. Without concentration, how can we control it? It was previously heard that the Chamber of Commerce in this city, in order to amend the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, requested the legislative authorities to stipulate that the same industry must join the guild, which is an important plan to improve the organization. However, based on the government's legislative intention, it seems difficult to give mandatory provisions to the people's freedom of association, so the numerous requests of commercial groups over the years have not been given clear provisions. However, referring to the organizational rules of Italian industrial and commercial groups, joining the association is voluntary, but those who do not join the association must, in accordance with national laws and regulations, bear the same obligations as members to pay membership dues and abide by all group contracts. At the same time, the rights granted to members by the government cannot be enjoyed by non-members. In this way, the state has not mandatory stipulated membership, but merchants, because of the balance of rights and obligations, are happy to join, so in practice it is no different from mandatory. All these vivid applications of legislative policy are sufficient to serve as a reference." It is heard that during Xue's study in Europe, he also held a position in the Embassy in Italy and was relied upon by the Ambassador to Italy, Liu Wendao. This time, he was called back to China by Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways and will serve in the Ministry. Therefore, after Xue arrives in Shanghai, he will immediately enter Beijing to pay his respects to the authorities, report everything, and then take up his duties in Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Song Ziliang Speaks Freely on the Financial and Financial Conditions of Guangdong Province: Implementing Prohibition of Gambling and Abolishing Harsh Taxes to Relieve the People's Suffering; Guangdong Province's Silver Dollar Reserve Has Been Substantially Replenished According to Law <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Song Ziliang, the special financial commissioner and director of the Department of Finance of Guangdong Province, flew from Guangdong to Shanghai by China Aviation on the 30th because he had to report to Minister Kong on the current financial situation of Guangdong Province and handle matters concerning the China Construction Company and the National Products Bank. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency went to visit him and inquired about the financial and financial problems of Guangdong Province. According to Song, everyone knows about the past chaos in Guangdong's finances. When I went to Guangdong to take office, the whole province had just been laid, and the financial situation was like a mess, and I felt that there were thousands of things to do and I didn't know where to start. Since February, I have been implementing the central government's rectification policy step by step, and with the assistance of the elders of the province, the progress has been quite rapid, and the initial rectification work has come to an end. The most significant work is to implement the prohibition of drugs and abolish harsh taxes to relieve the suffering of the people of Guangdong over the years. However, after this rectification, the income from gambling and harsh taxes has been reduced by no less than tens of millions of yuan. Furthermore, we have vigorously practiced frugality and reduced redundant agencies and floating personnel as much as possible. Except for the educational and cultural expenses, which have been increased appropriately, we have tried our best to reduce expenditures to seek a balance between income and expenditure. The progress of the change to the Silver Dollar system is also quite smooth. Now that the ratio of the Silver Dollar to the legal tender has been set, the financial market has been very stable, and commerce has become more active as a result. The total amount of Silver Dollar issued is more than 24.9 million yuan, with a total of 60% cash reserve. The shortage is 17% more. And the 40% guarantee reserve is not accurate. In addition to the central government's restructuring of the 120 million yuan of financial public bonds in Kwangtung Province, which has made up the reserve, the Ministry of Finance has also discussed with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to prepare cash and transport it to Kwangtung as a reserve, so the Silver Dollar reserve has been substantially replenished according to law. The unification of the national currency system has been completed, and the financial and financial situation of Kwangtung Province will inevitably become better and better in the future. This is indeed something to tell the people of the country. Song also said at the end that Kwangtung had previously borrowed 2 million yuan from the Shanghai banking community to control the specialty of native tobacco and will use the funds to provide loans to tobacco farmers to relieve the tobacco farmers from the exploitation of tobacco merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Protection of Animals Society: Holding a Life-Protecting Campaign Today; Special Document and Art Exhibition Held Yesterday and Today; Animal Treatment Center to be Established and Regulations to be Drafted <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Today is World Animal Day, with a city-wide ban on slaughter for the day. The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals, to promote the movement of protecting life, has specially designated yesterday and today to hold an exhibition of life-protecting writings and paintings from all levels of schools in the city at the City Chamber of Commerce to promote awareness. Visitors are very enthusiastic. The Society, out of compassion for the suffering of sick animals, is also establishing an animal treatment center. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibition: Purpose</p>
<p>The Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals, to promote the movement of life-protecting, is holding an exhibition of essays and books solicited from all levels of schools in the city at the City Chamber of Commerce in the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. The Chairman of the Society, Ye Gongchuo, specially issued a statement on the purpose of the exhibition, saying, "Some may say that in these troubled times of global affairs and changing circumstances, promoting the protection of life instead of engaging in practical work is contrary to the times." I say, "It seems so, but it is not." Although there are various underlying political causes for international wars, they are actually facilitated by a few warmongers. Regardless of who the culprit is, the ultimate victory will belong to those who have construction and production in the rear. This can be asserted. The matter of protecting animals, viewed superficially, may not directly contribute to the current crisis in our country, but it is actually one of the most crucial tasks in the construction of people's hearts. In recent times, the social customs have deteriorated, and morality has declined. The promotion of the Eight Virtues of the New Life Movement is also a wake-up call to awaken those who are lost in their dreams. Guan Zhong said, "There is no sorrow greater than the death of the heart." Even if a country's weakness reaches its extreme, if the people's hearts are not dead, it can ultimately be recovered. Moreover, war is a momentary phenomenon, while construction is the foundation of a nation for ten thousand years. Therefore, since the establishment of this Society, it has been three years in an instant. Over the years, it has stood against all opinions, adhering to the principles of the sages, treating all beings as one's own, and nurturing all life together, diligently working on publicity to revitalize the decadence of people's hearts. Fortunately, it has received sympathy and support from all parties, and the Society's affairs have progressed day by day. This year, it is holding an exhibition of life-protecting writings and paintings from all levels of schools in the city, hoping that our country's inherent benevolence, universal love, and ancient virtues will be deeply imprinted in the minds of children so that pure hearts can retain good images early on. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Revolution requires revolution of the heart first." The meaning of protecting animals is such. However, this matter is of great importance, and our efforts are limited. We still rely on the generosity of gentlemen at home and abroad to help us."</p>
<p>Exhibition: Situation</p>
<p>The exhibition of life-protecting writings and paintings from all levels of schools opened at 9 a.m. yesterday. Visitors streamed in an endless flow. From the gate of the City Chamber of Commerce, along both sides of the corridor, were plastered slogans and paintings promoting the protection of life, which could not help but evoke compassion for animals. The exhibition of writings and paintings was set up in the main hall of the Chamber of Commerce. The materials provided by the schools were extremely rich, and many were masterpieces, with more than a thousand items in total, a dazzling array that was a feast for the eyes. The Society sent many staff members to take care of the venue, and the Boy Scouts from Renhui Elementary School helped to maintain order. It is expected that today, being Sunday, there will be even more visitors. The Society welcomes visitors from all walks of life. However, the gift department requires a visiting pass issued by the Society to show restrictions.</p>
<p>Animal Treatment</p>
<p>The Society, to provide practical relief and alleviate the suffering of sick animals, plans to establish an animal treatment center. The following is a record of its origins: "Announcing that this Society has recently observed that various mute animals serve humans all day long, and their bodies have already suffered great pain. Once they develop diseases or injuries, they cannot speak and have no medical treatment, and their miserable groans are unbearable to witness. To provide practical relief and alleviate their suffering, we plan to actively establish an animal treatment center. Animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens, and geese, when they develop diseases or injuries to their limbs, can be reported to this Society or sent to the center for free treatment, so that countless animals with the same spirituality can enjoy equal treatment. However, this matter is of great importance and requires sufficient financial resources to succeed. In addition to having hired all the faculty and students of the Shanghai Gongli Veterinary College as veterinarians, we plan to appeal to benevolent people at home and abroad to uphold the grand vision of treating all things as one and practicing great compassion and kindness, to contribute generously and provide continuous support. Donations, regardless of size, will be equally meritorious, and the gratitude will not be limited to animals."</p>
<p>Request to Enact Regulations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Society specially submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan to enact regulations prohibiting cruelty to animals. The original submission stated, "Regarding the protection of animals, most European and American countries have established laws that have been implemented for a long time and have shown increasing effects. Recently, some have even included them in their constitutions. Their benevolence and righteousness are widely known and emulated everywhere. Our country was civilized the earliest, and the people have always cherished benevolence and love. Treating all things as one's own has been a clear teaching since ancient times. However, in recent times, people's hearts have become callous, and cruel customs have become increasingly rampant. Some indulge in satisfying their appetites, while others seek the benefits of exploitation, not hesitating to use all kinds of cruel methods on defenseless animals, causing injuries all over the place, which is shocking to witness. According to Article 21 of the current Implementation Rules of the Hunting Law of our country, 'Local authorities may, according to local conditions, formulate regulations to protect beneficial animals, which shall be implemented in conjunction with the Hunting Law and these Implementation Rules.' However, in reality, local authorities have not formulated the aforementioned regulations for the protection of beneficial animals, and the original intention of the legislation cannot be implemented. When facts occur, officials at all levels often use the excuse of not having laws to rely on, and do not prohibit them, or even regard them as remote and ridiculous. This deeply worries about hindering the rescue of people's hearts and the suppression of hostility, and the Society's work feels even more unable to proceed. Therefore, we have excerpted and translated the articles of the British Hunting Law and examples of cruelty to animals, and sent them to your esteemed Yuan, requesting that articles prohibiting cruelty to animals be stipulated in any law, whether it is of a positive nature, or that separate regulations prohibiting cruelty to animals be enacted to supplement the deficiencies of the current law. We respectfully await your esteemed Yuan's decision and implementation, which would be fortunate for all beings. This is submitted to Sun, the President of the Legislative Yuan, by Ye Gongchuo, Chairman of the Chinese Society for the Protection of Animals, and Guan Jiongzhil, Vice Chairman."</p>
<p>Rescuing Cats and Dogs</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Shanghai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has prepared a cat and dog ambulance that patrols the roads every day. Injured or sick cats and dogs are taken to the veterinary hospital for treatment. However, lost cats and dogs should still be handled by the police and will not be interfered with. Yesterday, the ambulance was on the streets for the first day and rescued a dog on Avenue Joffre that had been run over by a passing car. Today is the Society's annual fundraising day, and it is hoped that 5,000 yuan can be raised to cover the working expenses for the coming year. It is reported that the Society is organized by foreigners living in Shanghai and has more than a hundred members, with many Chinese women providing support.</p>

<p>"Fuhua" Carelessness</p>
<p>The "Fuhua" steamship of the Sanbei Company, which operates between Chongqing and Yichang, was transferring cargo bound for Sichuan from the company's "Little Sanbei" steamship on the 26th of last month. At 6 p.m., workers began loading cargo at the Yichang wharf. Several barrels of gasoline, salvaged from the stranded "Fuyang" steamship, were loaded on the front deck of the "Fuhua." It was said that there were some private goods (carried privately by people on the ship). One of the barrels leaked, and gasoline spilled onto the deck. Unexpectedly, a loading worker mistakenly threw cigarette ash onto the oil, causing a sudden burst of flames. With a loud explosion, the oil barrel exploded, killing two workers on the deck instantly. More than twenty others were injured (light burns). The remaining fire was extinguished, and the injured were sent to the hospital. The deaths were reported to the authorities and inspected by the court on the 27th. The corpses were collected and put in coffins. At the time of the explosion, the hull and internal machinery of the ship were not damaged. One cabin on the deck was destroyed. On the 27th, the cargo was loaded, and the ship sailed to Shashi, and after unloading the cargo in Chongqing, it will come to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<p>"Huaping" Aground</p>
<p>The "Huaping" steamship of the Minxin Company, which originally sailed between Xinghua and Quanzhou, has recently changed its route to Haizhou to load salt and transport it to the Yangtze River due to the off-season. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the owner of the "Huaping" steamship, stating that the ship had run aground at Chenjiagang, west of Kwangshan, due to shallow water. The ship's draft was more than 17 feet. It is now waiting for the tide and trying to rescue the ship. Details have not yet been reported to Shanghai. The Minxin Company has sent a telegram to inquire.</p>
<h3 id="e89">"Litong" Steamship Encountered Danger at Sea <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The "Litong" steamship of the Huitong Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,854 tons, a length of 27.5 feet, a width of 5.6 feet, a depth of 28.6 inches, and a draft of 22.5 inches, has 800 horsepower and can travel 12 nautical miles per hour. The ship was built in 1884. It was fully loaded with cargo and sailed from North China. On the afternoon of the first of this month, the ship was sailing in</p>
<p>Korean Waters</p>
<p>near Incheon, at 135 degrees 05 minutes east longitude and 37 degrees 17 minutes north latitude. According to the nautical chart, the location was near Nanao. The ship was proceeding when a strong wind suddenly arose at sea. The ship was hit by the strong wind and waves, making it impossible to move forward. However, the ship was sailing head-on into the wind. Unfortunately, the wind was too strong, and the ship's main shaft was suddenly damaged. The situation was dangerous. The captain immediately dropped anchor, but the wind became stronger and stronger, and the anchor lost its support.</p>
<p>Ship's Anchor Drifting</p>
<p>and drifted backward. At this moment, the captain and crew were terrified because they had entered a stage that was beyond their ability to resist. The captain urgently sent an SOS distress call, hoping for assistance from other ships. The Huitong head office in Yantai received the alert first and immediately notified Shanghai. The Shanghai office immediately sent a telegram to the Incheon office, ordering it to inquire about the truth of the accident and to quickly seek rescue measures nearby. It also telegraphed the Shanghai branch. Until yesterday morning, it received</p>
<p>Incheon's Reply</p>
<p>stating that the "Litong" steamship's main shaft had been damaged and that the ship had encountered danger in the strong wind and waves. Even the anchor that had been dropped had drifted with the wind. Now, the ship has reported that the wind has gradually subsided, the ship is safe, and it will not drift aimlessly again. The company was somewhat relieved to receive this telegram, but the details are still unclear and it has telegraphed the ship's captain again to quickly report the details.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tianjin Artificial Silk Piece Goods: Sales Method; Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Receives Ministry of Finance Instructions <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving a letter from the Silk and Satin Trade Association, stated that it was inappropriate to issue sales permits without requiring supplementary tax payments for artificial silk piece goods in Tianjin, and that the establishment of a General Inspection Office in Hebei and Chahar would hinder tax revenue. After forwarding the letter to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, "The submission has been noted. The inspection and clearance methods for piece goods made of artificial silk or mixed with artificial silk have been previously stipulated and implemented by this Ministry, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. All artificial silk accumulated by factories that comply with the regulations, cleared, and reported to the Customs should be subject to supplementary tax payments if they cannot provide evidence of tax payment. As for accumulated piece goods, the Customs shall issue sales permits. Factories throughout the country shall handle this uniformly. This Ministry previously received a telegram from the Director-General of Customs, stating that the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association had checked and verified the amount of accumulated artificial silk, piece goods, and silk warp stored on the machines by the factory members. The Tianjin Customs has been ordered to collect supplementary tax payments for the accumulated artificial silk and silk warp stored on the machines, and to issue sales permits for the accumulated piece goods. This is handled according to the original method. After the clearance, the artificial silk used and the piece goods woven by the factories will be subject to thorough inspection by the Customs in accordance with the regulations, which can prevent the malpractice of purchasing smuggled artificial silk as raw materials for piece goods. It can also help maintain the business of legitimate merchants. The request of the Association is not in accordance with the regulations and should not be discussed. Except for the section on the proposed establishment of an inspection office in Hebei and Chahar to inspect goods and collect consumption tax, which will be handled separately, it is appropriate to approve and instruct to be informed. This is the approval."</p>

<p>The New News Agency reports that since the implementation of the legal tender policy in our country, the people of the whole country have unanimously supported and vigorously promoted it. As a result, the demand for legal tender has increased day by day.

The amount of legal tender issued has also gradually increased. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the Issuance Reserve Management Committee that the recent issuance amounts of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China are as follows: Central Bank: 313,435,163 yuan; Bank of China: 377,768,426 yuan; Bank of Communications: 217,110,411 yuan; Farmers Bank of China: 18,503,321 yuan; totaling 1,016,817,321 yuan.

<h3 id="e97">North China Daily News Reports: Fessenden Discusses the Authority of the Municipal Council; Maintaining Peace and Order in the Concession Relies on the Decision of the Consular Body <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that this morning (3rd), a reporter from the North China Daily News interviewed Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and asked about the Municipal Council's attitude towards the extraordinary situation in the Hongkou District in the past few days. Mr. Fessenden replied that the Shanghai Municipal Council is an authority responsible for maintaining law and order within the International Settlement. However, a development of the situation that is beyond the power of the Municipal Council becomes a national diplomatic event and is somewhat beyond the control of the municipal authorities. The Japanese Marines have no legal authority to prohibit the police officers of the Municipal Council from freely acting in the performance of their duties, as has happened in recent days. However, soldiers, whether they belong to Japan or another country, often become overly enthusiastic when performing what they consider to be their duties, especially when it involves the honor of their country. They are easily prone to overstepping their legal rights due to temporary ignorance. Furthermore, the Japanese Marines have no legal authority to detain or confiscate the property of people of non-Japanese nationality within the Settlement, as has happened occasionally in recent times. However, residents of Shanghai overestimate the authority granted by the Municipal Council to the Police Department and forget that the Municipal Council is bound by the Land Regulations. Any extraordinary resolutions must be submitted to the Consular Body for a decision. All countries participating in the Shanghai Municipality have the right to send troops ashore to the Settlement to protect the lives and property of their nationals. The Municipal Council is entrusted by the authorities of various countries to maintain peace and order within the Settlement, but its authority is a municipal authority, and it has no power in itself. When Japanese soldiers landed and took over the management of the Hongkou area, a situation arose that was beyond the power of the Municipal Council. This must be arbitrated through diplomatic channels by the officials of the countries involved. The Japanese soldiers' seizure of police power to detain prisoners was completely wrong. However, the Municipal Council has no power or legal provisions to deal with this extremely complex point, so this matter will still be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. The Municipal Council has absolutely no authority to interfere with foreign troops stationed in Shanghai because the Municipal Council does not have the power of a sovereign state. If the situation reaches a critical point, the Municipal Council must refer it to the Consular Body for a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yesterday's Pujiang River: Sudden High Tide, Exceeding Forecast, Ankle-Deep Flooding on Low Roads <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, a major tide season, so the tide in the Pujiang River was quite high, close to the revetment. Low-lying roads were flooded, requiring vehicles for ferrying. The situation at the time is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tide Reaches Riverbank</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:59 PM, the high tide in the Pujiang River exceeded the prediction of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau (predicted height: 11 feet 1 inch). It was less than half a foot from the Bund revetment. The tide, agitated by the ship propellers, inundated low-lying areas such as the Bund Park and the Shiliupu Bund, creating a vast expanse of water, a spectacular sight. The boats along the shore appeared as if they were about to be rowed ashore, a truly unusual scene.</p>
<p>Roads Flooded</p>
<p>Many low-lying roads were flooded by the high tide. For example, in front of the Outer Customs House, water reached the stone steps. The section of Second Road from Sichuan Road in the west to the Bund in the east, as well as the intersection of Fifth Road and Sichuan Road, were ankle-deep in water. Water accumulated into a channel from the China General Edison Company on Sichuan Road to the side of the East Asia Bank. Pedestrians had to use rickshaws for ferrying. Several inches of water also accumulated in front of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Fourth Road and in front of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Four Counties on High Alert</p>
<p>Today is the peak of the high tide. The Jiangnan seawalls in the four counties of Baoshan, Taicang, Songjiang, and Changshu should be carefully protected to avoid danger. The Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau has specifically instructed the counties to pay close attention to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the people in these four counties.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Two Corpses Case at Hongkou Women's Hospital: Court Hears Murder Details, Buying Diploma and Committing Murder, Concubine Admits Helping at the Scene, Judge Carefully Orders Further Interrogation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The widely publicized case of the buried male and female corpses at Hongkou Women's Hospital involved the main male perpetrator, Zhang Wenhua (27 years old, Shanghainese, also known by ten other aliases, including Gu Penggan), and the main female perpetrator, Zhang's concubine Chen Xiaobao (also known as Liang Meiyu and Xu Shuzhen, 25 years old, Shanghainese). They were arrested by Chinese Detective Zhou Guisen, Detective Inspector Cui Chengke, Huang Fugen, Xu Decheng, and Detectives Shen Binkui, Qiu Zhenting, Wang Dongchen of the Hongkou Concession Police, along with detectives from the French Concession Police, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday in the attic room at No. 13, Lane 455, Kangding Road. Over 900 yuan in banknotes was seized. They were taken back to the police station and detained separately.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. Many men and women were in the audience. The details of the trial are recorded below. First, Judge Zhong Qing inquired about the age, place of origin, occupation, and address of Zhang Wenhua and Chen Xiaobao. Then, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stood up and described the case's breakthrough: "On September 4th of this year, Yu Gengsheng, a man, and Lu Aili, a woman, were strangled to death at Hongkou Women's Hospital. The circumstances of the discovery of their bodies were detailed in previous statements when the two defendants' hired maid, Fei Wang, and driver, Chen Pengfei, were requested for detention. As this matter was of great importance, the police immediately</p>
<p>conducted a careful investigation and learned that Chen Xiaobao's sister, Chen Abao, was residing at No. 25, Lane 95, Avenue Petain in the French Concession. We went to investigate and learned that Chen Abao was indeed living with her sister, but they had recently moved to No. 63, Rue Jules Pestel. The detectives went to No. 63 to investigate, but discovered that they had moved elsewhere on September 15th. It was also found that the moving was entrusted to the Tong'an Moving Company at No. 9, Lane 104, Avenue Haig. The detectives learned from Tong'an Company that the defendants had moved to No. 13, Lane 215, Kangding Road. The detectives went to No. 13 and were informed by the tenant Zhu Ahui that the defendants had moved to No. 13, Lane 455 on the same road on September 29th. Therefore, the two</p>
<p>defendants were arrested there early the day before yesterday. It was also learned that Zhang Wenhua's wife, Zhang Yao, was also living with them, but she had moved to the home of a relative, Lu Yunliang, at No. 6, Jia 10, Bao 8, Xiaoyingfang, Chuansha, Pudong before the arrest. The detectives, together with Chen Liande, the chief of the local Public Security Bureau, went to arrest Zhang Yao, but were unsuccessful. Zhang Wenhua graduated from the MacMillan Academy in 1928 and then worked as a nurse at Baolong Hospital for three years, but did not complete his term. In 1931, he transferred to another hospital and, for 200 yuan,</p>
<p>obtained the abortion business on Broadway. On September 2nd of this year, Yu Gengsheng from Sichuan, accompanied by Lu Aili, went to Hongkou Women's Hospital for an abortion, stating that the surgery fee was 35 yuan. That evening, the defendants first examined Lu. The surgery began at 8:00 AM the next morning. Due to the surgeon's lack of skill, Lu's uterus was punctured, causing severe bleeding and a dangerous situation. Yu Gengsheng, who accompanied her,</p>
<p>argued strongly with the defendants, leading them to have murderous intentions. On September 4th, Yu was injected with an anesthetic needle. As Yu was dying, he was strangled with a towel to death. Lu was also given an anesthetic injection, and Liang Meiyu stuffed gauze into her mouth, suffocating her to death. The two bodies were then buried underground. Liang bought 150 pounds of lime from Taiji Lime Store at No. 89, Xinjiabang Road, and lead sheets from Huiyuanxiang Hardware Store at No. 203, Tangshan Road. Zhang and Hua borrowed tools from Chen Linji Carpenter Shop at No. 314, Zhaofeng Road, to</p>
<p>pry open the floorboards and bury the two bodies. On September 7th, the defendants, along with Zhang's wife and Liang's sister, hired a Chinese Moving Company to move their belongings to No. 6, Lane 311, Rue Montigny, and No. 8, Dahua Lane, Nanyang Bridge, and frequently returned to Hongkou Women's Hospital to listen for news until they moved to Rue Jules Pestel on September 15th, after which they stopped checking the news. The police have now exhumed the bodies from under the Hongkou Women's Hospital, photographed them, and presented them as evidence." Zhang Wenhua confessed that he had worked as a nurse at Baolong Hospital but had not completed his apprenticeship before working at another hospital. Chen Xiaobao was his concubine. On April 1st of last year, they opened Hongkou Women's Hospital, specializing in treating women's dysmenorrhea, anemia, and tuberculosis. On September 2nd, Yu Gengsheng from Sichuan and Lu Aili came to the hospital for an abortion, stating that the fee was 35 yuan. As usual, I would first examine Lu's lower body and</p>
<p>perform the surgery, but in the past, I had never made a mistake when performing abortions. This time, it was because I was</p>
<p>having trouble with something, and I used too much force when starting, causing her uterus to rupture and her abdomen to gradually swell, leading to a very dangerous situation. At 2:00 AM on September 4th, Yu Gengsheng rang the bell downstairs. I went downstairs and saw the woman's eyes were white and she was barely breathing. Yu argued strongly with me and refused to give up. I then had murderous intentions and wanted to die with Yu so I could silence him. I lied to Yu, saying that the only way to save the woman was to borrow his blood. Yu agreed. We went upstairs together, and I killed him with a German anesthetic needle. It was just a misunderstanding, but when Judge Zhong asked Zhang during the autopsy, "There was still gauze around Yu's neck. Why was that?" Zhang replied, "Although the person was dead, I was afraid he would come back to life</p>
<p>as a zombie, so I wrapped gauze around his neck to cut off his breath. The cloth in Lu's mouth was because her stomach had rotted, to prevent the odor from coming out, and I was afraid she would come back to life, so I gave her another injection. Afterwards, I borrowed iron tools from a nearby carpenter shop to bury the bodies underground." Chen Xiaobao confessed that she had an affair with Zhang and that they had met because Zhang had rented her extra house. Later, Zhang opened a hospital and invited her to be a nurse, and they lived together. On September 2nd, a man and a woman came for an abortion. After the diagnosis, it was determined that the woman was three months pregnant. When asked why she wanted an abortion, the woman replied that there were various reasons why she had to have one. I initially asked for a surgery fee of 40 yuan, but we agreed on 35 yuan. Zhang performed the abortion, and I only</p>
<p>helped from the side. The rest of my testimony is the same as Zhang's, to be brief. In the end, she said that we were both young and inexperienced, and that Zhang Wenhua had an elderly father at home, and asked for leniency. Zhang and Chen both hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Siliang to defend them. Judge Zhong said that the case still required investigation, so he ordered the defendants to be detained for further interrogation on the 13th, and also ordered the lime shop, hardware store, and carpenter shop witnesses to be summoned for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Japanese Sailor Tagang Killed: Zhang Ronghe Interrogated Yesterday; Police Believe Zhang Is a Major Suspect, But Zhang Denies Any Knowledge of the Matter <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>At 8:20 PM on the 23rd of last month, a Japanese sailor named Tagang Asao was shot and killed at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road, in front of the Shanghai Bank, a Japanese business. At the same time, two other Japanese sailors who were with Tagang, Yahata Yoshiharu and Izuto Yozo, were also injured. Another sailor escaped unscathed. After the incident, the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai were immediately dispatched to the area near the scene and arrested three suspects: Zhang Ronghe, a Tai Zhou street vendor, Ma Yongcai, a worker from the Hongxing Printing House from Jiading and Ma Yongnian. A pistol was found in a sand box at the entrance of Lane 15, Haining Road, and another pistol was found in Yuqingfang, Haining Road. Afterwards, the Public Concession Police handed Zhang and the other two over to the First Special District Court with the approval of the Japanese Command, requesting their detention. These facts have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was continued. Ma Yongcai and Ma Yongnian hired lawyer Ping Heng to appear in court. Subsequently, Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court opened the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that after investigation, the police found insufficient evidence against the suspects Ma Yongcai and Ma Yongnian, and they were mistakenly arrested while passing by. Therefore, it was decided not to prosecute them, and the court was requested to stop their detention and release them. Zhang Ronghe was considered a major suspect, so a postponement of one week was requested. The gun found in the sand box in Lane 15, as well as the nine shell casings and one bullet found, were all tested by the firearms department and confirmed to have been fired from that gun. The gun found in Yuqingfang was tested and found not to have been used. At this point, Judge Zhong ordered the release of Ma Yongcai and Ma Yongnian, and the police took the two away. Only Zhang Ronghe remained. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu continued to state that there were as many as 25 witnesses in Zhang Ronghe's case, and they had all made statements at the police station. However, only three Japanese witnesses were present in court today: Horiue Tadashi, Suehiro Akio, and Miyata Hajime. According to Hori's statement to the police, he was a tailor living at No. 114, Lane 332, Teeswell Road. On the day of the incident, he was at a meeting at No. 6, Lane 15, Haining Road when he suddenly heard gunshots. He rushed out, initially suspecting that the gunshots came from North Haining Road, so he went there but saw nothing unusual. Then he circled around Wusong Road to South Haining Road and saw a crowd gathered at the entrance of Lane 15 (the lane connects South Haining Road and North Haining Road at both ends). He saw two old women kneeling on the ground, and Zhang Ronghe was opening the lid of the sand box with his left hand, opening it about six inches, and then putting something black in his right hand into the box. At that time, Hori said to Zhang, "You killed the person!" Zhang immediately closed the lid of the box. Hori stepped forward and arrested Zhang, and a gun was found in the box. Suehiro and Miyata's testimonies were the same. According to Suehiro, he was working in the wireless business at No. 519, Haining Road. He heard gunshots and went out to see three Japanese soldiers lying on the ground on Wusong Road, seemingly seriously injured. Then he met an uninjured Japanese soldier in a Japanese bookstore (translated as Xue Shan Du), who told him the location of the incident. He rushed over and saw Zhang standing about a yard away from the sand box, and he helped Horiue Tadashi arrest him. He also presented a map. Horiue Tadashi also submitted a statement to prove everything, and his statement was the same as the lawyer Zhang's statement. (Omitted) When Zhang Ronghe was interrogated, he confessed that he was indeed arrested by Horiue Tadashi, three or four steps away from the sand box. Because he heard gunshots at the time, he suspected that his fellow countryman Chang Tai was harmed (Chang Tai also set up a congee stall near Lane 15), so he went to investigate and was arrested. Chang Tai lives at No. 92, Dongxing Lane, Teeswell Road. He did not kill the Japanese soldiers and did not know who killed them. The police lawyer Zhang stood up and said that Chang Tai was indeed a person who set up a congee stall near the scene. He also made a statement at the police station. Zhang Ronghe and his mother did set up a congee stall about 67 yards west of Lane 15. He also presented a map. Judge Zhong Qing interrogated Suehiro Akio about his experience in helping Horiue Tadashi. Miyata Hajime's statement was the same as Suehiro's, so he was not questioned in detail. It was announced that the matter would be adjourned until 2:00 PM on the 9th of this month for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e102">National Exhibition Conference of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Open as Usual on Sundays <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Business Hours Extended by One Hour. The National Products Exhibition Conference, organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, has seen extraordinary business development for participating manufacturers since its opening on the first day, due to its neat layout and excellent products. In the past three days, the number of visitors was over 50,000, and the total turnover of the manufacturers was about 20,000 yuan. Among them, the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Anle Woolen Factory, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, A. P. O. Electric Factory, Yuhua Soap Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Sino-French Pharmacy, Tiger Balm Yong'an Hall, Huacheng Tobacco Company, and Anmian Mattress Factory had the best business, and other factories were also quite strong.</p>
<p>Extended Hours</p>
<p>The conference was originally scheduled to close at 8:00 PM every day, but now, because the number of visitors every evening is exceptionally large, and the manufacturers are overwhelmed with hosting, the hours have been extended by one hour starting yesterday, until 9:00 PM. Although today is Sunday, a holiday, the conference will still be open as usual for visitors from the academic and business communities.</p>
<p>Commendation</p>
<p>Since the opening of the conference, it has been widely praised by all parties. Yesterday, Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a letter of commendation and personally wrote the words "Striving for Daily Renewal" to encourage it. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, also wrote the words "Gathering of Outstanding Views." The conference will have them engraved in the conference memorial publication for posterity.</p>
<p>Initiation of Celebration</p>
<p>The manufacturers participating in the conference, especially Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Vice Chairman Xu Xiaochu, and all the committee members and staff, have put in a lot of effort in the planning of the conference. Therefore, the Sino-Western Pharmaceutical Factory, Tiger Balm Yong'an Hall, and others have initiated a celebration conference to be held on a scheduled date, and commemorative items will be presented. It is heard that Chairman Wang and Xu, after learning about this, have informed the General Director Zhu Boyuan to politely decline on their behalf.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Shanghai Municipal Council Actively Streamlining: Dissolving Volunteer Corps Artillery Units <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Board Meeting Minutes Record Merits; Hope Soldiers Do Not Disperse.</p>
<p>For the sake of active streamlining, the Shanghai Municipal Council recently approved the recommendation of the Defence Committee at a board meeting to dissolve the existing two artillery units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This proposal was decided by the Defence Committee on September 21st, after considering reports from all relevant departments, and recommended to the Board that it be terminated immediately. The reasons for the termination are two-fold. First, after the dissolution of the artillery unit, direct recurring costs can be saved by 15,000 yuan per year, and the vacated buildings can be used for the urgently needed expansion of the General Office and the Rates Office. Furthermore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps' current light artillery is outdated, and the ammunition is nearing its expiration date. If it is not dissolved, the purchase of new ammunition would require a huge sum of money, which is beyond the current financial capacity. In addition, there is no suitable location for exercises other than Hong Kong, and the travel expenses would be difficult to arrange. Second, in terms of practicality, the artillery unit must have rigorous training to achieve superior effectiveness, and both personnel and equipment must be constantly improved. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps' scope of activity is limited to Shanghai, so it is felt that the artillery unit is too much for a volunteer corps to handle. It is heard that the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has agreed to the termination of the artillery unit but expressed that the excellent members of the two artillery units should not be allowed to disperse after this. He hopes that they will understand the necessity of the termination and join other teams or special police to serve the community. Furthermore, the community as a whole should have a considerable sense of gratitude for the past service of the artillery unit. General Macnaghten spoke next, saying that although he had agreed to the dissolution, he had once been the commanding officer of the unit, so he felt regret at the demise of the unit. He hoped that all parties would have a correct understanding of this matter, and that the excellent members of the unit would not be allowed to disperse afterward. He also said that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council should express gratitude for the unit's past excellent performance. The Chairman then moved that the Board unanimously record its gratitude for the past service of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Artillery Unit and hoped that the officers and soldiers of the unit would not be allowed to disperse in the future.</p>

<p>Nanshi: In front of the West Gate, at No. 575 to 577, Chao Chia Road, Zhang Ji, a native of Zhenru, opened a Pinshengzhai Doufu shop. Recently, due to the economic downturn, he rented out the house at No. 575 to Zhang Zhiyun, 39 years old, a native of Anhui, who specialized in the wholesale of children's toy money firecrackers. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30, Zhang went out and did not return. His wife, Zhang Chen, 31 years old, also from Anhui, was working and stacking items when, due to carelessness, a cart full of firecrackers fell over, causing an immediate explosion. The loud noise shook the house. Chen was injured in the head, both breasts, and both legs, with her flesh torn apart in a gruesome sight. The police arrived at the scene and took her to Shanghai Hospital, but she could not be saved and died immediately. The Wenmiao Road Police Station sent police to investigate the incident and waited for her husband to arrive for questioning. At the same time, the local security officer was informed to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Jingjiang Bandit Wu Zhenrong Was Hanged Yesterday: Original Name Chen Mingsheng Wrote a Will in Court, Asked for a Full Meal Before Death and Sang Peking Opera: A Person Who Disregarded the Law Has Been Hanged According to the Law <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The bandit Wu Zhenrong (29 years old), also known as Chen Mingsheng, from Jingjiang, was sentenced to death for leading accomplices to rob the Jixing Pawnshop at No. 640 Haining Road at 9:55 PM on July 28th of last year and killing Chaozhou native Wang Xiangxun when the robbery failed. After the case was discovered, he was arrested by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Concession Police and brought to the First Special District Court for questioning. The Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the death sentence the day before yesterday and ordered its execution. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. Judge Shen Shanzeng presided over the court and asked him if he had any last words and if he wanted to write to his family. He said that his father and wife had died many years ago, and his old home was in Sidunzi, Jingjiang, with only a few houses, which were managed by his brother. He planned to entrust his paternal uncle, Ming Xueyou, to sell the property and have his cousin Wenlin come to Shanghai to collect his body. The court had him write a letter in his own hand, which he did briefly: "(To my dear uncle, I hope you are well. Your nephew did not listen to your teachings and has come to this. I did not listen to my uncle Xueyou's words in the past because I was doing bad things outside. I am now being executed on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month. I am having my cousin Wenlin collect my body. The land and property at home should be sold, and there must be no mistakes. Your nephew Chen Mingsheng, sent to Chen Xueyou at Yongfeng Pharmacy, Sidunzi, Jingjiang)." He was calm and said that he had not had a full meal in prison (execution prisoners are given two yuan for meals, and the police were ordered to buy him food) so that he could be a full ghost. Judge Shen ordered Wu Zhenrong to be sent to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for execution by hanging, and the Chinese and foreign police of the police station took him away, along with the case file, and handed him over to the Shanghai Local Court for execution, appointing Prosecutor Xie Lian as the supervising officer. The prosecutor immediately led the clerk Zheng Jiyu and Inspector Xuan Zhiming, and also supervised the chief and deputy judicial police officers Zhang Shuping and Chen Xihui, leading execution policemen Shen Tingfang and Zhou Qiwen to the second prison execution ground in Caohejing. The judge, together with Warden Ding Lei, took his seat to begin the case and brought the criminal Wu Zhenrong to the case to confess. "I am not called Wu Zhenrong. My original name is Chen Mingsheng. My cousin is coming to collect my body. Today I die, I am not sad, I am very happy, but my last request is to eat some fruit." The judge smiled and nodded, and ordered him to be taken down for execution. The criminal then sang his Peking opera, a kind of fearless attitude that was very rare. Police Chief Zhang and others directed the bailiffs to tie the criminal to a wooden stake, and the noose was tightened around his neck as required. It took half an hour for him to be strangled to death. The noose was immediately sealed, and the body was left exposed overnight. It was re-examined the next day before being collected for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Fang Baizhou and Wu Guangen: Recommended a Business, Causing a Death - Borrowed Money to Buy a Foot Knife, Lodged to Assassinate, Startled from a Dream, Pursued to Death <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Fang Baizhou, a 24-year-old from Nanhui, worked as a noodle maker at the Wuweizhai noodle shop at No. 9 Minzhi Ni Yin Road (behind the Gonghe Hall of the Great World) in the French Concession. He had been making noodles for four years. The noodle-making area was set up in the stove room at No. 11 Xin Shou An Li across the street. He also lodged in the noodle-making area at night. When needed, he invited his fellow villager, Wu Guangen (25 years old), to be his substitute. Recently, a certain accountant of Wuweizhai opened a new shop in Xin Zha. Wu asked Fang to recommend business to him. They reached an agreement on August 4th of the lunar calendar (September 19th). On August 10th (September 25th), Wu came to Shanghai from his village, intending to have Fang accompany him to take over the shop. Unexpectedly, someone else had already taken it over, and Wu's chance for business fell through. Fang then explained to Wu and told him to return to his village for the time being and wait for him to find another recommendation and notify him to come to Shanghai to take over the shop. Who knew that Wu would misunderstand and think that Fang was unwilling to recommend him and was meddling, so he had the idea of suspecting and killing Fang to vent his anger. On the afternoon of the 2nd, he went to Fang's place, falsely claiming that he was sick and had no money to buy medicine, and borrowed five jiao of silver from Fang. Fang lent him the money as requested. Wu got the money and went to Ximen to buy a foot knife about an inch wide and four inches long, hiding it on his person. In the evening, he went to Fang's place again to borrow a place to stay. Fang did not suspect anything and readily agreed, inviting him to sleep over. Wu slept until about 5 a.m. yesterday morning. Taking advantage of Fang's deep sleep, he took out the hidden foot knife and stabbed Fang in the right side of his throat. Before he could pull the knife out, he turned and ran out of the door into the alley. Fang, startled awake by the pain in his dream, jumped up to chase the murderer. Fang was shirtless and barefoot, wearing only short trousers, and his body was covered in blood. He chased him to the intersection of Minzhi Ni Yin Road and Avenue Edward VII. Fang pulled the foot knife out of his neck, and fresh blood gushed out like a tide. His body collapsed to the ground due to extreme pain. At that time, Hong Chenfu (37-year-old Anhui native), the gatekeeper of No. 722 Xin Shou An Li, caught a glimpse of it, helped catch up, and apprehended the murderer Wu Guangen. They called the police and brought him into the Avenue Joffre Police Station. On one hand, they sent detectives to take the injured Fang Baizhou to Renji Hospital by car. Because the wound bled too much, he died at 5:30 without medical treatment. The hospital notified the French Police Station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for an autopsy. At 10 a.m., the police sent the criminal to the Second Special District Court. Court President Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Court came to the First Criminal Court to interrogate him. The lawyer of the Police Department said that the defendant was arrested this morning for murder. The Police Department has not yet investigated the case, and requested that the defendant be detained to investigate the facts of the case and change the date to file a lawsuit for trial. Then, Detective Ma Yizhi reported the process of arresting the defendant and presented the murder weapon. When asked, the defendant Wu Guangen confessed that on the 4th, he asked the deceased to recommend business, and he agreed to recommend him. After he got the recommendation, he came to Shanghai on the 10th to take over the shop. He said that the business had been taken by someone else, so he was angry. Yesterday afternoon, he went to Ximen to buy a knife, stayed at his place that night, and when he was fast asleep at dawn, he stabbed him once and ran away. There was no other resentment, and so on. After verifying the confession in court, it was ordered that the trial be rescheduled for the morning of the 9th. The defendant was taken back into custody. At noon, Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, accompanied by medical examiner Jiang and Clerk Peng, etc., came to the hall to examine the body. The criminal was brought by the detectives, and his confession was the same as before. The official questioned the witnesses Hong Chenfu and Zhang Yusheng, etc. Because the deceased's family was still in the countryside, the official ordered that it be verified that Fang Baizhou died of knife wounds, and the body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. The defendant will be sent to the court for trial. It is heard that the deceased has not yet started a family, and there are an elderly mother and younger brother in his hometown. His shop owner has sent someone to his hometown to urge them to come to Shanghai to collect the body.</p>

<p>Zhang Yongfu Visited on Bail - Miss Chen Er Does Not Recognize Him</p>
<p>The case of the Japanese businessman Xuan Sheng being assassinated on Avenue Disweili and Qimei Road has recently been solved by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, who arrested the criminals Wang Zhensheng, Mao Yonghu, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daohong, and women Wang Zai Shi and Zhang Mo Shi, etc. All six of them confessed that they were instigated by the reactionary cadre Hua Ke to assassinate Xuan Sheng in order to cause international disputes. A pistol was confiscated and a document was moved to the local court for investigation. However, the person in charge of this case is Prosecutor Xie Lian. Because he wanted to use investigative tactics to further recruit accomplices, he notified the detention center that if anyone came to visit the above-mentioned male and female criminals, they should detain the visitor for interrogation. The day before yesterday, a man from Qingjiang named Zhang Yongfu, 48 years old, residing at No. 75 Baxiang Bridge, Dadongmen, went to the detention center to visit Zhang Mo Shi, claiming that Zhang Mo Shi was his cousin. The detention center reported this to the prosecutor, who detained Zhang Yongfu and opened a court to interrogate him. Zhang confessed that he used to be a cook on a ship in Luoyang and now sells ducks and chickens. His cousin Zhang Mo Shi lives nearby at No. 72 Shachang Street. Because Mao Yonghu in this case was arrested at Zhang Mo Shi's house, she was also implicated and detained, so he came to visit her. The judge believed that Zhang Yongfu was not suspected of anything, but he still had to be released on bail and prove that he was a good person. He then asked Zhang if he had any relatives or friends in Shanghai who could vouch for him. Zhang said that there was a Miss Chen Er who works as a female guard at Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, who could vouch for him. Yesterday, Prosecutor Xie, taking advantage of the execution of death row inmate Wu Zhenrong by the First Special District Court, brought Zhang to the prison to meet with Prison Director Ding Lei and summoned Miss Chen Er to the court for questioning. However, as soon as Zhang saw Miss Chen Er, he shouted at her. Unexpectedly, Miss Chen Er looked blank and said that she did not recognize him. Even after Zhang's repeated requests and the judge's explanation, Miss Chen Er could not vouch for him. Therefore, he had to be taken back into custody and find another guarantor.</p>

<p>Bai Suzhen Bitterly Accuses Him of Being Deceived - Wei Dixing is Unavoidably Guilty of Adultery</p>
<p>Ma Loufen, a film star, director, and director of the Miaoyin Dance Troupe from Suzhou, 27 years old this year, married Bai Suzhen (21 years old this year), a woman from Beiping, four years ago. They lived with his parents at No. 16 Xingshun Nan Li, Remi Road, in the French Concession. The couple's love was very deep, and they had a daughter named Die Nan, who is two years old this year. Last month of this year, when Ma led the troupe members to perform in Nanyang, he had a relationship with Wei Dixing, a female troupe member from Hangzhou, 19 years old this year. After returning to China, he kept Wei at home in the name of teacher and student. Later, because his wife was by his side, it was inconvenient for him to act. He rented a room on the second floor of a Russian house at No. 226 Ladu Road and lived with Wei. From then on, he did not return home to stay overnight, ignored his wife Bai, and did not care about his wife's life. Recently, Bai found the residence of Ma and Wei and reported to the French Police Station on the 2nd through Lawyer Bian Lu. At 2:00 in the morning, detectives were sent to the upstairs of No. 226 Ladu Road, and Ma and Wei were both arrested and taken to the police station for detention. After investigation, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan of the Police Department stated the case and filed a public prosecution for the crime of disrupting the family according to Article 239 of the Criminal Law. The court believed that the case was related to public morals and should be prohibited from onlookers. The defendants admitted to adultery during the trial. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 7th. The defendants were each released on bail of 500 yuan. After the defendants requested a reduction, the court approved it and each reduced the bail to 300 yuan. Without bail, they were taken into custody. According to Ma's wife Bai, when Ma returned from Nanyang, he brought Wei home, saying that Wei's parents were not in Shanghai and that she was temporarily borrowing a place to stay. They were just teacher and student, and she did not suspect anything else. At night, Ma slept on the bed, and she and Wei slept on the floor. Until recently, when her parents-in-law celebrated their birthday, Wei paid respects to her parents-in-law, and her parents-in-law called Wei "new grandmother" and her younger uncle called Wei "sister-in-law." She did not understand the reason and questioned Ma. He admitted that he had newly married her as a concubine, and her parents-in-law also wanted her to admit it. She refused and opposed it. Ma then went out with Wei to rent a house and live together. When she was at home, her parents-in-law abused her. Ma did not return home from August 1st. When she was at home, she worked every day and was more bitter than a maid. Unable to bear it, she found out the residence of Ma and others and reported it to the police station for arrest.</p>

However, the power of Japanese yarn factories in the Shanghai yarn market is gradually increasing. Looking forward to the future, it is said that Chinese yarn factories have not yet escaped from a dangerous situation.</p>

Mr. Li gave careful diagnosis and treatment and was always able to cure them. Since he came to Shanghai, it has been difficult to count the number of friends and relatives who have been cured by him. However, Mr. Li is gentle and refined, and content with simplicity, and has never been famous for his medical skills. It was not until recently that he followed the advice of celebrities Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, and others to hang his pot and save the world. His clinic is now located at No. 106 Xingrenfang, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Luzon Road. The consultation hours are from 7:30 to 10:00 am and from 6:30 to 9:00 pm. For morning consultations, only a consultation fee of 60 cents is charged, and poor patients can receive free medicine.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I, Cao Guilin, from Tongrentang Chinese Medicine Store, one of the involved parties in the matter, am writing to you directly. I was shocked to read in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month the news that our store was distributing counterfeit Liushen Pills from the Tongchuntang medicine store opened by Zhu Qingxi, and that more than 3,000 boxes of fake pills were confiscated by the French police, and that an apprentice was detained. Although our store did once purchase the Tongchuntang brand of Liushen Pills from Tongchuntang, the packaging and trademarks were all of that store's brand. Our store has been established for many years, so how could we dare to purchase and distribute counterfeit goods? Later, because sales were poor, we switched to purchasing from Lei Yushang, and we still have many pots of stock to this day. As for your newspaper's claim that 3,000 boxes were confiscated and an apprentice was detained, this is absolutely untrue. The fact is that a few days ago, while I, Guilin, was out, several people claiming to be detectives from the Chinese area came to the store and used intimidating language. The shop assistants ignored them because there was no fact of distributing counterfeit Liushen Pills. When I, Guilin, returned to the store, I originally intended to report this to the French police, but because I did not know the names of the people who came, I did not investigate further. The various details published in your newspaper, I believe, were fabricated by a third party, with the intention of undermining our store's business, and were caused by the reporter's mistaken investigation. As this matter concerns our store's reputation and business, and for the sake of your newspaper's accuracy, in addition to taking separate legal action, we request that your lawyer send a letter of correction, etc. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to your newspaper, hoping that you will make the above corrections. Sincerely, to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Shanghai. Lawyer Sun Zhixiang, October 3rd.</p>

<p>Special Issue for the October 4th World Animal Day Convention</p>
<h3 id="e130">Foreword <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Some say that in these troubled times and in this autumn of changing circumstances, is it not contrary to the times to promote animal protection instead of engaging in practical work? I say it seems so, but it is not. International wars, although they have various political causes, are in fact instigated by a few warmongers. No matter who the instigators are, the result is that victory ultimately belongs to those who have construction and production in the rear, that is my assertion. Animal protection, on the surface, does not directly help our country's current crisis, but it is a crucial part of building people's hearts and minds. In recent times, customs have become debased and morality has declined. The promotion of the Eight Virtues of the New Life Movement is also a jolt to the head, an act of awakening from a dream. Guan Zhong said, "The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart." Even if a country is weakened to the extreme, if the people's hearts do not die, there is always hope. Moreover, war is a momentary change, while construction is the foundation of a country for ten thousand years. Therefore, since the establishment of this association, three years have passed in an instant. Over the years, we have resisted public opinion and adhered to the teachings of the sages, who believed in the unity of all beings and the nurturing of all life. We have diligently carried out advocacy work to revive the decline of people's hearts. Fortunately, we have received sympathy and support from all sides, and the association's work has progressed daily. This year, we are also holding an exhibition of animal protection writings and paintings from schools at all levels in this city, with the aim of deeply imprinting the ancient virtues of benevolence and universal love in the minds of children, so that pure minds can retain good images from an early age. Sun Yat-sen said, "Revolution must first revolutionize the heart." The purpose of animal protection is such, how can it be said to be contrary to the times? The guest said, "Yes, yes." I command it, and write this as the opening remarks of the special issue. However, this matter is of great importance, and my own strength is insufficient. I still rely on the generosity of gentlemen at home and abroad to assist us.</p>
<h3 id="e131">A Brief Account of the Association's Work in the Past Year <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Jiong</p>
<p>Time flies like a fleeting shadow. The annual World Animal Day has arrived in an instant. Looking back, this association has been established for more than three years. Its past work was reported in summary in the animal protection days of the previous two years. In the most recent year, thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of people from all walks of life and all members, the association's work has progressed. Although limited by the environment and constrained by finances, all matters concerning animal protection that should be handled have not been fully promoted, the advocacy and publicity work seems to have achieved considerable success. Now, I would like to make a brief report on the association's work in the past year as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Undertakings: Regarding matters of appeal, in addition to appealing to the local governments to ban the killing and eating of plowing cattle and paddy frogs, and to stop the killing of stray dogs and the skinning of unborn lambs, etc., based on the reports of various members and people from all over the country, each case has been handled separately. In April, we also petitioned the Legislative Yuan to enact a law prohibiting animal cruelty. Recently, we jointly drafted a simple charter for banning dog catching and improving treatment with the Shanghai Western Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and sent a letter to the Municipal Health Bureau for approval and implementation. At the same time, we also submitted a request to the Ministry of the Interior to issue a national ban on slaughter for one day on Animal Day, October 4th this year. Regarding matters of releasing animals, for those in this city who send animals to the association for release, we will find ways to transfer them to the Dachang Huisheng Society and the Municipal Zoo for raising. The association is currently planning to build a release garden in the near future. We have already obtained the consent of the Wusong Bao'an Temple to lease 35 mu of vacant land permanently. Construction can begin as soon as the funds are raised.</p>
<p>(2) Organization: Our country has a vast territory, and the situations in various places are quite different. If we want to promote animal protection, we are afraid that we will not be able to reach everywhere. Therefore, according to the original plan, we have widely established branches. Currently, there are four established branches in Xijing (Chang'an), Wuxian, Nanjing, and Changsha. There are three branches under preparation in Rugao, Dongtai, and Nanchang. We also began to recruit members on Animal Day last year, in order to gather ideas and jointly plan implementation. In the past year, 286 new members have joined the association. (3) Publicity: In recent times, the trend of human cruelty has become deeply entrenched. Therefore, the association's publicity work must strive to be widespread, in order to arouse the attention of people in society. In the spring, we hired eight promoters to go to various places to investigate. If they encounter any acts of animal cruelty, they will immediately dissuade them with gentle words, and explain the meaning of treating all beings as equals and nurturing all life. In the summer, we reprinted 10,000 animal protection paper fans and distributed them to people in this city, which were warmly welcomed by all sectors and eagerly sought after. They were all distributed in a few days. Recently, we have also produced a kind of animal protection merit badge, which is worn on the lapel. It can arouse our interest in animal protection. It is also the meaning of the ancients wearing strings of beads to warn themselves. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, we will hold an exhibition of animal protection writings and paintings from schools at all levels in this city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, so that citizens can have a deep impression and widely promote the meaning of cherishing life.</p>
<p>The above are the major events. There are still many matters to be handled in the future, which need to be carried out step by step. We sincerely hope that kind people at home and abroad will provide guidance and assistance with their strength. I am extremely grateful and offer my prayers.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Loving Creatures <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Deyi</p>
<p>"Universal Love" is one of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles. The "universal love" he advocated certainly refers to the mutual love and care between human beings. Mencius also said, "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others," and also said, "He who has no heart of compassion is not human." The so-called "heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others" and "heart of compassion" certainly also refer to the emotions that individuals feel from the heart for their own kind. However, we all hope that all animals live lively lives. Who can bear to hear their moans when they are sick and their cries when they are dying? This proves that the heart of compassion is not only for one's own kind. However, some people with abnormal psychology are not fierce to humans, but have狰狞 faces and cruel means to other animals. Take the farmer as an example, he bows and obeys the landlord, shrinking in fear. That pitiful attitude is utterly pitiful. However, when dealing with the cattle that help with the work, he shouts at them every day, making them work all day long, either plowing the fields or scooping water, with no time to rest. Occasionally, because they are too tired from work, they are occasionally lazy, and then they are whipped and beaten. As for their living conditions, there is no need to mention them. The stalls are never cleaned, and the food is never adjusted. How can this not increase their mortality rate and reduce their growth rate?</p>
<p>The same is true for horses. They labor all day long, carrying hundreds of pounds of goods on their bodies, transporting them back and forth. The only reward they get is the master's whip and an unsuitable resting place.</p>
<p>Chickens and ducks are provided for people to eat. Roosters can crow at dawn, and hens can lay eggs. They are also beneficial to humans. However, many people hold them upside down. Try to put yourself in their place and think about how uncomfortable they must be at that time. When it comes time to kill them, some people even pluck the feathers from their necks first before killing them. This is too inconsiderate. Their being killed is already cruel enough, let alone suffering this even more inhumane crime before death.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats are also livestock. We use them to protect us because dogs can guard the door and cats can catch mice. Therefore, they are beneficial animals. Some playful children arbitrarily beat dogs and cats, causing their skin and flesh to suffer. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If we want to love and protect them, so that their mortality rate can be reduced, we must often wash their fur, often clean their bedding, and reduce their workload, so that they do not suffer physical pain. This is the true expression of the "heart of compassion" and the original intention of universal love!</p>
<p>One winter, Europe was unusually cold. Many mandarin ducks in Lake Geneva froze to death. The authorities sent medical vehicles to rescue them. I looked down from the building and thought of the hundreds of millions of refugees in my homeland, wandering in the wind and snow, not worth a glance from the wealthy and noble. Living in a foreign land, I felt that some people were inferior to things. I wrote three poems and sent them to the Animal Protection Association.</p>
<p>Middle-aged sorrow and joy oppress the rest of my life.</p>
<p>From now on, I am afraid to spend another snowy sea.</p>
<p>Embroidered quilts are idly piled up like Yue Ejun's.</p>
<p>May the heavenly flowers scatter spring cotton seeds.</p>
<p>Why must we pity only the ornamental birds?</p>
<p>The ethereal soul does not scatter with the clouds and smoke.</p>
<p>A new sorrow in my journey, an epitaph for a crane.</p>
<p>I remember combing my wings in the wind of falling plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Who will share the desolate countryside in the wind and snow?</p>
<p>Warmth protects all living beings, creating a brocade cloud.</p>
<p>May we all cross over together, vowing to be boundless.</p>
<p>Waiting to realize the promise of our hearts for a hundred thousand years.</p>

<p>— Hu Bing</p>
<p>Don't hold ducks and chickens upside down.</p>
<p>Try to compare it to yourself.</p>
<p>Keeping dogs requires cleanliness.</p>
<p>Dirtiness is annoying.</p>
<p>Paddy frogs protect grain insects.</p>
<p>My heart aches when I eat them.</p>
<p>Cattle and sheep provide many benefits.</p>
<p>Don't whip them lightly.</p>
<p>The little sparrows under the eaves.</p>
<p>The homeowner must love them.</p>
<p>Holding them upside down is bitterly miserable.</p>
<p>Hanging them up is the same taste.</p>
<p>Don't make them dirty.</p>
<p>The sight of it is also embarrassing.</p>
<p>Don't buy them to eat.</p>
<p>How can you bear to eat beneficial insects?</p>
<p>Raising them requires cherishing them.</p>
<p>Prevent them from shedding tears.</p>
<p>Chirping expresses happiness.</p>
<p>Carefully warn children not to catch them.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Psychological Construction for Animal Protection <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Animal protection in China is still a nascent movement. Protecting life is human nature, but this nature is gradually being extinguished. Sun Yat-sen said, "Revolution must first revolutionize the heart." The foundation of animal protection is to revolutionize the heart. In everyone's mind, building a solid line of defense for animal protection will ensure that the effectiveness of animal protection can be counted on.</p>
<p>So how can we build this psychological defense line for animal protection? In my opinion, it can be divided into four points:</p>
<p>(1) Everyone must have a spirit of universal love</p>
<p>Humans are originally full of universal love, and they have a passion for protecting all living things. The decline of this spirit of universal love and the increasing cruelty of killing creatures, the first reason is the mischief of human selfishness.</p>
<p>Selfish psychology is a manifestation of human inferiority. For the sake of personal interests, they do not hesitate to make any sacrifices, and innocent animals encounter tragic fates.</p>
<p>I once saw a person buy a new handgun and use stray dogs as targets. When that poor dog lay inexplicably in a pool of blood, stretching its legs in the final struggle of life, that person showed a proud and狰狞 smile. I have also met a gentleman who likes to raise birds. He does not hesitate to use thousands of small green insects as food for his birds. There was also a parent who was frightened by a frog and, after encountering frogs, beat them to death alive! ... Ah! These and those, it is truly endless. These are full of selfish psychology performances, truly a great shame and insult to mankind;</p>
<p>To overcome these selfish psychologies, everyone must have a spirit of universal love. What is the spirit of universal love? It is a rich sense of sympathy. We must love ourselves, and we must love others. We must love people, and we must love things. We must sacrifice the interests of the small self to maintain the interests of hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>
<p>(2) Everyone must have a spirit of diligence</p>
<p>The second obstacle to be broken psychologically in the animal protection movement is the psychology of pleasure. "Enjoying the present" is a traditional concept. Countless animals have sacrificed their lives under the psychology of people enjoying the present.</p>
<p>Not to mention wealthy families, even "peddlers and hawkers" and "those who sell soup from carts" have a few dollars in hand today, they have to buy half a catty of meat and a fish, kill a chicken, make soup with wine, and drink and eat at home. When they are in a good mood, they may even add a few Yangcheng Lake red crabs. The people eating are eating with joy, but how can they know the moans of pigs, the struggles of fish, the cries of chickens, and the tragic scene of crabs being trapped in a hot pot?</p>
<p>To overcome this psychology of pleasure, everyone must have a spirit of diligence. Vegetables are indeed not as delicious as fish and meat, cotton batting is indeed not as warm as fox fur, and tofu is indeed not as nourishing as young chicken juice… But for the sake of the life of a member of the biological world, we would rather give up this and choose that. This kind of material diligence is rewarding, and that is the great spiritual pleasure!</p>
<p>(3) Everyone must have a pragmatic spirit</p>
<p>"Wine pools and meat forests" are symbols of family extravagance. Without delicacies from land and sea on the banquet table, it cannot be considered a formal wine banquet. Families with weddings and happy events often boast of how many pigs and sheep they have slaughtered and how many chickens and ducks they have killed to show off the greatness of their "排场". People who do not wear fox-lined or squirrel-skin coats in winter cannot be considered well-off. Misses and madams who do not have a fox fur collar cannot be considered nobles. If this social psychology of competing for vanity is not eradicated, those innocent lives will be slaughtered in batches by cruel humans;</p>
<p>To eradicate this psychology of vanity, everyone must have a sincere heart to create blessings for animals! Everyone should change their past attitude. Using the means of killing animals to show our luxury is shameful, cruel, and barbaric. It is a manifestation of the primitive beastliness of human beings and cannot be tolerated in modern civilized society.</p>
<p>(4) Everyone must have the spirit of courage</p>
<p>Some people say, "I really want to practice animal protection, but my strength is small, and it has no effect, and sometimes I am laughed at." This kind of excuse of "everyone does this, so I do this" is a manifestation of utter laziness and a manifestation of the psychology of fearing difficulties and seeking peace of mind. To achieve success in animal protection, this psychology must also be removed.</p>
<p>First, we must "start with me, regardless of whether others do it or not."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Our World Games Delegation Arrives in Shanghai: A Total of Eighty-Five Male and Female Team Members Arrive; Attend a Welcome Tea Party Held by Various Organizations in the Afternoon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Our country's delegation to the World Games and the delegation for sports youth inspection in Germany, led by head Wang Zhengting, arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday aboard the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso. The Shanghai Physical Education Association arranged the Suilin Apartment as the delegation's accommodation. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, various organizations in the city held a joint welcome meeting at the YMCA. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Port Arrangement: The ship docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. A portion of the welcoming representatives traveled by the scheduled City Ferry No. 5 from the New Customs Wharf at 12:15 PM to welcome them, while another group stood waiting at the wharf. The Aviation Association specially dispatched the Save-the-Nation No. 1 and No. 2 aircraft to welcome them at the Wusong Estuary. The gate of the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf was adorned with crossed Party and national flags, and a banner reading "All Circles of Shanghai Welcome the Return of the World Games Delegation" was hung high. A colorful archway was erected on the wharf. All welcoming personnel were equipped with welcome flags, creating a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Welcome from All Sectors: The Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters each dispatched a band to play music at the port. City Ferry No. 5 met the Conte Rosso near the Fish Market. As the ship docked, the welcoming personnel boarded to greet the delegation, including Wu Shizhang's representative Li Dachao, Director Zhou Jue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, Secretary Wang Zhinan of the Garrison Headquarters, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Zhu Changnian, Legislator Li Denghui, General Secretary Shen Ciliang of the National Sports Advancement Association, Jian Shiqin of the Shanghai Debt Bureau, as well as representatives from the Municipal Stadium, the Chinese Physical Education Association, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Chinese Boy Scout Council, Mao Heyuan from the Ningbo Association, the Jingwu Athletic Association, the Aviation Association, the YMCA, the Southeast Women's Physical Education College, Liangjiang Normal School, China Women's Physical Education School, and the private Zhong, Guoguang Middle School, Chengzhong Middle School, Dongya Physical Education College, Jushenghe Athletic Association, Qinfen Bookstore, Xiayi Society, Zhiguang Society, etc.</p>
<p>Landing and Departure for Accommodation: After a brief exchange of greetings with the welcoming personnel, the delegation lined up neatly on the wharf and shouted "Long live China" three times. They then boarded the city ferry to the New Customs Wharf and disembarked, setting off firecrackers as they left. They proceeded to the Zheng Apartment in Germany for rest. Head Wang Zhengting returned directly to his residence from the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf.</p>
<p>Welcome Tea Party: At 4:00 PM, various organizations in the city held a tea party at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge to welcome the delegation. Attendees included the delegation, the inspection team, Wu Mayor's representative Li Dachao, Liu Xuefang of the Municipal Council, Lu Shuang, Wu Kaisheng of the National Road Association, Jia Siwu of the Public Security Bureau, Xu Zhiyi of the Chinese Physical Education Association, Luo Beichen of the China Insurance Company, He Dekui of the Local Association, Li Longbiao of the Jingwu Athletic Association, Zhu Shaoping of the World Chinese Student Association, Zhang Yuliang of the Aviation Association, Zhao Weizu of the Boy Scout Council, Zhang Binghui of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Jin Runxiang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Jianbai of the Cultural Construction Association, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Fan Wei of the Garrison Headquarters, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Tong Muge of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Ling Xitao of the YMCA, totaling two hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Li Dachao, representing Mayor Wu, presided over the meeting and delivered a brief welcoming speech. He Dekui then delivered a welcome speech, stating that it was a great pleasure to meet with everyone after several months apart. He said that the whole country was very concerned about their trip abroad. Although the results were lagging behind, failure is the mother of success, and he hoped that they would continue to work hard. He said that their trip to Europe to compete in sports with advanced European and American countries, even in defeat, was honorable. He believed that if the world held competitions in other fields (such as commerce and industry), the results of our country would be even worse than those shown by participating in the World Games. He hoped that they would not belittle themselves but invigorate their spirits and strive for the future.</p>
<p>Jiang Jianbai's Speech: Jiang Jianbai then delivered a speech, stating that competition always has victories and defeats. If strength is not as good as others, one must conserve energy and wait for the future. Hearing is not as good as seeing, and seeing is not as good as being there in person. He believed that they had gained a lot of practical experience from this trip and that if they could continue to work hard based on what they had learned from observation, their future success could be anticipated. Two students from Liangjiang Women's School then presented flowers, which were accepted by Wang Zhengting on behalf of the delegation.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Speech: Wang Zhengting, the head of the delegation, replied, stating that he was both grateful and ashamed for the warm welcome and reception given to the Chinese World Games delegation upon their return. He said that sports are a matter for the entire country and cannot be represented by a few athletes. It is of great importance to national rejuvenation and the physical strength of the people. He said that he deeply felt from this trip that sports are widespread and developed in various countries, and their results are naturally good. Moreover, sports can stimulate national concepts and are an important strategy for establishing a country. He said that he knew that this trip would be a failure, but in order to seek improvement, it was necessary to have a clear understanding of the advantages of advanced countries and the shortcomings of oneself. The purpose of the delegation was precisely this. Although the results were not as good as others, they strived to compete, hoping that others would have some understanding of our country's sports spirit. The government and the people should jointly identify the direction and fundamentally improve. Therefore, there was also an organization for the inspection team. He said that the only result of this trip was to give people in various countries considerable attention. The sixty-nine athletes, including track and field, ball games, and marathon events, had made much progress compared to their participation in Los Angeles. Among them, the Chinese martial arts performance along the way had won much praise. In the future, he hoped that the whole country would unanimously promote sports, strive for training, and pay attention to methods to increase the physical strength of the people. In the future, the board of directors of the National Sports Advancement Association will discuss the reports of the delegation and the inspection team, so as to seek improvement, report to the government, and make public announcements for all sectors to adopt and implement. He said that since they are about to disperse, he hoped that they would not be discouraged by failure but would work harder because of failure. He also intended to petition the government to promote sports more effectively in the future, because sports are the basic work of education.</p>
<p>Issuing Certificates: After the speech, World Games certificates were issued, along with certificates for the delegation and the inspection team. The original text was: "The Eleventh World Games will be held in Berlin, Germany, from August 1st to 16th, 1936. Mr./Ms. so-and-so is selected as a member of the so-and-so team of the Chinese delegation. This certificate is hereby issued." It was signed by the Chairman of the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association and the Head of the Chinese World Games Delegation, Wang Zhengting, and the General Secretary, Shen Siliang. Finally, Wang Shifu, who had just returned from Turkey, delivered a speech. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>National Arts Honor: According to the National Arts Team, after the closing ceremony, the team performed in Foshan, Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, Star, and other places, and was very welcomed, indicating that the Germans were very interested in Chinese martial arts. It is said that the team has reported everything to Chu Minyi by letter.</p>
<p>Return Itinerary: The delegation left Berlin on the 1st, arrived in Rome on the 2nd, and boarded the ship in Naples on the 4th, setting sail at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The journey was smooth and calm. More than 40 Japanese athletes also traveled on the same ship. When in Bombay, it was planned to hold a triangular track and field competition between China, Japan, and India, but it did not materialize. When the ship passed Singapore, it encountered wind and waves, and most of the members of our delegation were seasick. In addition, Feng Youzhen, a special correspondent from the Central News Agency, is still staying in Europe for inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Mr. Wang Zhengting, Head of Delegation, and Others Talk About Their Impressions of Participating in the World Games <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, the head of the delegation, talked about his impressions of participating in the World Games as follows: (1) The results of our country's delegation to the World Games were known before going abroad. The reason for participating was to gain experience. This was the first official participation, as only one person participated in the previous Los Angeles World Games. It is deeply hoped that participation will attract the attention of the entire nation. Although the results of the National Games and several Far Eastern Games have been reported in the newspapers, they have not received sufficient attention from the people. This participation in the World Games, in comparison, will make the people aware of the disparity in strength and strive to improve. (2) The cause of sports requires the attention of the general public, but it also requires the government to vigorously promote it in order to be widespread and deep-rooted. Sports are the foundation of education. Only with a healthy body can there be a healthy spirit. For thousands of years, our country has emphasized literature and belittled martial arts, and this habit has been ingrained for a long time. The biggest reason for the failure of this participation in the World Games is insufficient physical strength. It is hoped that the government's education authorities will pay attention to this. The physical fitness of the people and the future of the nation are deeply dependent. (3) In sports competitions, physical strength is one thing, and technique is another. Our country's physical strength is indeed insufficient, and the technique is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is very important to conduct technical research in a scientific way. In addition to selecting athletes, there is also an organization for the sports inspection team. The members of each team are all sports directors of various universities and sports researchers, hoping to contribute what they have learned to the government and the people, as a basis for future reform and innovation. (4) The next World Games will be held in Tokyo in four years, which is very close to our country. At that time, athletes from various countries will definitely come to China for sightseeing after participating in the conference. It is deeply hoped that our country's government and people will prepare in advance so as to give a good impression to people from all groups. (5) I have been promoting sports for more than thirty years, but I have not yet been able to develop a sports talent, which is very regrettable, etc. It is reported that Mr. Wang will stay in Shanghai for a day or two, go to Beijing to pay respects to the authorities and report on the progress, and then go to the United States to take up a new post.</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng Talks About the Inspection Team Leader Hao Gengsheng Talks About His Impressions of Sports in Various Countries, Saying: (1) From this inspection of various countries, I feel that there are many strengths of other countries, and very few of them are truly unknown to the Chinese people. What is regrettable is that people have specific and practical plans and implement them step by step, while we know but do not act, which is the same as not knowing. The reason for this is the problem of people. For example, during the World Games, Germany convened sports researchers from various countries to organize an international student sports camp. The head of the camp was free to move around, but he stayed in the camp during the World Games and never left, never visiting the World Games for a single day. This kind of dedication to duty and willingness to take responsibility is worthy of emulation. If the Chinese people can have the same spirit and the same concept, then there is nothing in the world that cannot be done. (2) Although the government has been vigorously promoting sports in our country in recent years, it has attracted general attention, but the degree of attention is still not as high as the general level in various countries, and we must continue to intensify our efforts, not only in terms of verbal theory but also fully expressed in actual action. (3) Considering the trend of education in various countries, I feel that the position of education in our country in the future must take the physical fitness of the people as the priority of all education. The first principle of education is to exercise the body. Sports are the foundation of morality and intelligence. Only with a strong body can we cultivate morality and study and become an ideal and healthy citizen. (4) Considering the progress of various countries, it is due to their ability to take the strengths of others and make up for their own shortcomings, and to have the courage to reform. If our country wants to make progress in sports, it can only do so by striving to implement them. Although each country has its own national conditions, and what is applicable to other countries may not be entirely suitable for China, it is also necessary to abandon the short and adopt the long, and take the essence and use it extensively, etc.</p>
<p>Shao Rugan Talks</p>
<p>(1) The results of this World Games have made significant progress compared with the past. Although our delegation has no performance to comfort the people of the country, the participants have done their best. Due to the disparity in physique and the slightly poor skills, the results are relatively poor. However, the participation of a large number of people has attracted the attention of hundreds of thousands of spectators, which is enough to change international hearing. (2) The precious records of the World Games are not accidental. They have considerable strength and superb skills. This level cannot be achieved without persistent practice. (3) Only when the people have a general interest in sports can outstanding talents be produced, and the enthusiastic promotion of the government and the people is necessary. (4) Each movement has a unique consciousness to promote. In the future, the sports community in our country should also pay close attention to this, and it is most important to popularize the concept of national sports. (5) Examining sports in various European countries, their unique consciousness is formed by the background of their society, country, and politics. The administrative group of sports has been based on political organization. Without government control, there will be no effect of promotion and development. (6) The inspection team has completed the first draft of the report, with detailed suggestions on sports in our country in the future. Adopting the strengths of others, making up for our own shortcomings, and working hard, we may be able to raise our heads in Tokyo in 1940, etc.</p>
<p>Jin Zhaojun Talks</p>
<p>Politicians and educators in various countries regard sports as a basic cause for strengthening the nation and establishing the country. In this World Games, in addition to sports competitions, there are also gatherings on sports education issues, which can prove that the above-mentioned statement is not wrong. The environments of various countries are different, so European and American countries mostly create a sports national policy that adapts to the special environment based on their own national environment. This phenomenon is particularly evident in Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and Sweden. The above-mentioned countries all have special and significant sports effects. Therefore, my first impression is that the sports national policy of the Republic of China must also be based on our special environment and determine a plan of at least ten years of training in order to revive the Chinese nation. The second impression is that the average development of sports in various countries is not as distorted as in our country. They have integrated society and schools. In our country, social sports are far inferior to others. Even when it comes to school sports, the problem of elementary school sports has not yet been studied and practically done by anyone. Even middle and high schools at all levels also present a phenomenon of divergent development. This is the second urgent matter to be resolved. The last impression is that the authorities in European and American countries mostly have the spirit of burying themselves in work. This is a kind of spirit that we currently need most.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Cai Wenli Talks About the Failure of Football and Basketball <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>When Cai Wenli landed in Singapore, he talked with Xue Guangqian, the president of Shanghai News Agency, who returned on the same ship. European football tactics and methods are peculiar. The center half only stays in a straight line in front and behind. The two full-backs and the left and right center half-backs are one in front and one behind. Sometimes the full-back intrudes to the left and right flanks of the striker and also defends the position of the full-back. The ball is passed as smoothly as we play basketball, and it is foolproof. The ball thrown out of bounds at the goal can be thrown to the opponent's goal, just like a normal corner kick. Watching professional football games in the UK is amazing. Observing its training methods is convincing. After our team was eliminated by the UK, they left Berlin on August 11th and went to various countries to observe. There were a total of seven exhibition games, one win, one draw, and five losses. The performance in the game in Paris was the best. People in various European countries were very impressed with the sportsmanship of our team. Regarding the criticism on the technology, it is so-called "clean," so the impression of our team is very deep. As for the reasons for the failure, there are three points: (1) Insufficient physical strength; (2) Inaccurate passing; The weather conditions. As for the previous Hong Kong report that Li Guowei died due to injury, it is completely unfounded. Also, in the friendly basketball games in Germany, they won against Italy and Peru, and lost to the United States. In the official game, they first met Japan and unfortunately lost. They then won against France, and finally lost to Peru and Brazil. Looking at the reasons for the failure in the game against Japan, (1) the players were flustered on the court and could not fully display their skills; (2) the tactics were stagnant and they could not adapt to changes, and they were arbitrarily arranged by the enemy and could not cope with it. In the penalty kicks alone, our country had fifteen opportunities to throw the ball into the basket, but only two goals were scored, which is a pity.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Situation of the Inspection Team Will Be Grouped for Research and Compilation of Reports <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A total of thirty-seven male and female members of the sports inspection team to Germany, except for Li Youling and Xu Yingchao, who went to Springfield University in the United States to specialize in sports, Wu Demao, Le Xianqu, Huang Yunzhi (female) who stayed in Germany for inspection and research on sports, Cui Yalan who went to the United States to study sports, and Xu Minhui who went to the United Kingdom, France, Russia and other countries for inspection and planned to return to China via Siberia next month, the remaining thirty members, led by head Hao Gengsheng, returned to China. Among them, Ye Guantang, Liu Quanduo, Guo Songtang, and Tan Yingbin had already landed in Xianghuai, and a total of twenty-six members arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Inspection Process: The inspection team traveled to seven countries, a total of nine places, namely Berlin and Dresden in Germany, Stockholm in Sweden, Copenhagen in Denmark, Prague in the Czech Republic, Vienna in Austria, Budapest in Hungary, and Rome in Italy. Among the countries, the longest time was spent in Germany, living in an international school camp. The observers were mostly sports specialty schools, as well as elementary schools. In Dresden, they visited elementary and secondary school sports and the world-famous Art Student Museum. The other six countries traveled for a total of seventeen days. The shortest time was spent in the Czech Republic, only half a day, and the longest time was spent in Italy, three days. In Sweden, they visited the Lin's Sports School, which invented Swedish gymnastics. In the Czech Republic, they visited the Sokol Sports Association. In Austria, they visited a girls' middle school. The completeness of the equipment was unmatched by other European countries. There was a special ski course, with four weeks in winter dedicated to skiing. Failure in this course meant that one could not graduate. The school's sports field had no such facilities except for the University of Vienna. Therefore, the government divided the entire city into five districts, each with a sports field for the use of school sports in the district. The method was economical and could be adopted. In Hungary, they visited a sports specialty school. The school produced a large number of talents. Most of the athletes who attended this World Games came from this school. They also visited a sports ground run by the government, with hot spring baths and various sports facilities, which was a good place for public sports. In Italy, they visited a male sports school, the Mussolini Sports Field, and the "Balilla" camp. Overall, the most developed public sports were in Hungary and the Czech Republic, and the most impressive were the two countries of Austria and Italy. The method of compulsory labor for young people in Germany was practical and was a good system in modern times. Italy's "Balilla" youth training, the combination of intelligence, morality, and physical education, and its down-to-earth and pragmatic spirit was unmatched by other countries. When visiting the camp, the ears were filled with music, shooting commands, and the sound of footsteps, which was tragic and majestic, and made people excited. The memories are still lingering today.</p>
<p>Group Research: For the convenience of reporting, the inspection team divided the inspection of sports in various countries into groups for research. On the ship, each team member began to draft the initial report and held a meeting in Singapore to discuss the matter. It is reported that the detailed general report will be compiled into a book by each group and published. The members are divided into groups as follows: Sweden Shao Rugan (convener) Xia Xiang, Jiang Zhensui, Chen Yongsheng, Czech Qian Yiqin (convener) Chuan Jingru, Lu Xiangqian, Du Yufei, Denmark Huang Yanming (convener) Peng Wenyu, Hu Anshan, Ye Guanhe, Germany Zhang Huilan (convener) Wang Shoufang, Yu Yongzuo Guo Songtang, Tan Yingbin, Hungary Wu Bangwei (convener) Shu Hong, Chen Tude, Gao Zi, Italy Jin Zhaojun (convener) Li Zhou, Zhao Wenzao, Du Longyuan, Austria Wang Huaiqi.

<h3 id="e150">Finance: Market Sentiment Has Turned Calm, Gold Standard Bidding Weak, Bullish Speculation Wavering, Falling Back 5 Yuan <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Although London pure gold rose yesterday, the gold market was slightly stable at the opening. Unexpectedly, market sentiment turned calm, and buying interest weakened. Major players repeatedly supplied gold, lacking support, gradually declining. It was found that the overseas silver market was flat in both England and America at the beginning of the morning. Monte Carlo's forward silver prices were unchanged or slightly reduced by 1/10. Exchange rates fluctuated. London's raw gold rose 6.5 pence. Off-exchange forward trading opened at 60 yuan and some odd amounts. Dadecheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and others immediately supplied gold, dropping to within 59 yuan. The Central Bank's listing was announced, with England and America both flat. The Customs Gold Unit rose 1.1 cents. The standard gold standard price was listed as 1146.6 yuan. Fuxing, Yongchun, Yuan Yong took advantage of the low price to make entries. The morning opened flat. After the opening, Dadecheng and others continued to sell, but because short sellers also covered, there was still a rebound. Ignorant major players such as Dadecheng had a particularly strong intention to sell. The market lacked buying interest. The forward exchange market was also loose, continuing to decline. The HSBC Bank's listing was announced, with England and America both flat, and the silver balance tax also remained unchanged. There was slightly more struggling in the middle, but unfortunately, market sentiment was weak, and bullish speculation wavered, making the trend even weaker. Even if buyers took advantage of the low price to trade, it was just hovering. The afternoon closing was slightly calmer. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1159.7 yuan, with no change from the previous closing. Dadecheng sold off, falling back to 9.2 yuan. Fuxing, Yong Qia, and Feng Yong made entries, rising back to 9.9 yuan.

Yuan Mao Yong Dingkang took advantage of the low price to maintain, and the afternoon closing rose to 1154.7 yuan. After the closing, it was stable.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold standard price, rose to 1146.6 yuan, about 8 yuan higher based on the closing price. The current month's registration is 1150 yuan, and November's is 1155 yuan. The morning's make-up water is 1150 yuan. The spot market situation is still stable. Silver shops and dealers are working hard to absorb it. Spot selling is also surging. Tongfeng Heng sold more than 100 taels, adding 19 yuan. Dafeng Hengli sold more than 1,000 taels, adding 17.5 to 8 yuan. Shengyuan Yong Nai sold off more than 300 taels, 17.5 to 18 yuan. The buying price added 12 yuan, but there was a lack of supply. Tianjin goods added 13.7 yuan, but there was no transaction. The swap market was extremely quiet.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were average. In summary, Fu Yu Yongchun Yuanyong Fuyu Yuxin Xiangshengyuan Yong Qiafeng Yong Yingfeng Heng Dingkang Jinfeng Yong Chang Yong Qing Fa Yong Shun Mao Fu Da and others were on the buying side. Dadecheng Tongfu Tianfa Xiang Feng Chengda Hengyu Shenda Yong and others were on the selling side.</p>

The highest price was 1159.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 1153.8 yuan, a fluctuation of 5.9 yuan. As a result, it fell back 5 yuan compared to the closing. The total number of transactions in the first half of the day was 4,354. There were 490 standard bars remaining for the current month.

<p>Yesterday's securities trading continued its dramatic rise, and the trend was extremely strong. Because the environment was gradually becoming calmer on the surface, market sentiment was refreshed. Major short sellers covered, and floating short positions followed. Chips on the table were extremely tight, and market prices rose sharply. The entire day's process was quite impressive. The four trading sessions of yesterday went as follows: the market sentiment at the opening was very good, and Nos. 47, 11, and 50 were all being bought. Nos. 35, etc., were being sold, but because chips were tight, they all rose by 0.35 to nearly 1 yuan. The trend in the final session was even stronger. Nos. 33, 6, and 53, etc., were still being bought, and Nos. 11 and 16 had quite a few sales. All Ding-Wu bonds continued to rise by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan. The Ding-Bing bonds rose by 0.7 yuan.

<p>The yarn market is trending weaker, and the falling trend has started again. This is because sales have turned bleak, and the situation of overseas yarn and cotton is consistently downward. Market sentiment is affected, and many bulls, aware of the unfavorable environment, are closing out their positions. The market is becoming more and more frustrated. However, some are tightening and not letting go due to the lack of spot goods.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls More Than 1 Yuan in Each Month</p>
<p>The standard yarn front market was exhibiting unevenness in each month. The market atmosphere in the second session turned firm, and bullish speculators bought in, rising by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. By the third closing session, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were not smooth, and the three-grade yarn market fell back. Market sentiment suddenly loosened and fell. It was found that Dafu, Jinchang, Senkang, Runkang, Xiecheng were selling, while Changfeng picked up Mai Yunyong, and He Hua bought in quite a bit. As a result, each month's standard yarn fell by 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation at the afternoon opening was still sluggish and listless, due to the sluggish sales of yarn. Although the news turned mild, the interest of real players in the market was waning, and market prices instead fell. This was because major players were trending towards the short side. As a result, each month fell again by 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that the sellers were Dafu 2,250 bales, Bochang 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, Renfeng 1,200 bales, Runkang 3,200 bales, Xiecheng 2,450 bales, Tonghe 1,100 bales, Mingsui 1,300 bales, Shenji 2,550 bales, Taichang 1,350 bales.

<p>The current yarn sales situation is relatively bleak. It was found that the total amount purchased by each group throughout the day was only 620 bales. The selling price fell by more than 1 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 75 Yunnan 40 Inland 240</p>
<p>Hankou 10 Jiangxi 230 Peers 25</p>

<p>The cotton market turned down, and the market condition was weak because the English and Indian cotton markets were consistently downward. A certain major player suddenly sold off, and the chips on the table loosened. In addition, the domestic climate was suitable, and cotton production was good, with hopes for further increases. Sellers were particularly active when prices rose.</p>
<p>Short Sellers Massively Sell Standard Cotton</p>
<p>In the standard cotton front market opening, the recent months were still firm, but when photographed to distant months, they tended to loosen. The second session was flat and distant and high, but in the third closing session, the falling trend suddenly intensified because major players came to sell again. The falling trend in the recent months was particularly strong. This was because American cotton fell 11 to 16 pounds per unit due to the southern hedging sale. Indian cotton also fell. The three-grade cotton fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Therefore, there were still many people selling when prices rose. It was found that Dafu massively increased short positions, while Tongji Hengyi Gengfeng Wang Tai Xingyuan Xingchang and others sold off consistently. Only Yuda Changfeng slightly made up for short positions. Jifeng Senkang Shenji Yuan Yi Shengyuan all bought in. As a result, each month fell by 0.2 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening at noon, the market situation was particularly weak, because they sold in large quantities, falling 0.3 yuan in the recent term and 0.1 yuan in the distant term. After one session, it was still flat. By the closing, the distant term rebounded by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. As a result, each month fell again by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan compared to the closing price in the second half of the day. It was found that Jinkang 3,100 dan, Dafu 5,500 dan, Tongji 3,100 dan, Hengyi 2,200 dan, Gengfeng 4,000 dan, Wang Tai Xing 6,800 dan, Fengtai 3,600 dan, Renfeng 1,300 dan, Yikang 1,600 dan, Xinchang 2,000 dan were sold.

<p>Yesterday's opening of American cotton, the Liverpool news was unfavorable, the weather was good, hedging sales increased, foreign merchants sold off, and each unit fell by 7 to 13 pounds. The needs of the industry were flat. Only short sellers and the industry continued to buy when the price fell. The delivery notice for the October term was issued for 27 sheets. The market was not affected. Afterwards, there was a slight rebound. Buyers and sellers held their ground. The current feet are stronger, and the demand is active. Printed cloth trading is smooth, and it has been extended to next spring. Hester estimates that the week's factory usage is 277,000 bales, and Liverpool's reserves are 234,000 bales. The closing was stable. The spot price fell by 11 pounds per unit, and the futures fell by 11 to 15 pounds per unit. Today's weather forecast is that there is a slight chill on the eastern seaboard, and central and western Alabama are both clear. English cotton spot fell by 3 points, and futures fell by 6 to 7 points. Cotton exporters bought in, and short sellers sold in large quantities. Long-term bulls closed out their positions in pain. Later, the price rebounded due to industry buying. Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, Mula fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.75 rupees.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, the market situation in each month, presented a phenomenon of first being flat and then rising sharply. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was good at 0.2 yuan, Canada was good at 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. When the price was opened, the market sentiment stabilized because the foreign wheat rebounded. Compared to the closing price of the previous day, it was considered good at 0.01 yuan. By the second session, because the situation was easing and because flour was related to people's food, domestic reserves could not maintain a year's needs, and Tianjin sales turned smooth and mobilization was very active, it was temporarily difficult to determine foreign wheat, so the buying enthusiasm was revived, which was good at 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, the transactions were smooth, and the market rose sharply. The market value in each month was a new record after the currency change. Half because Tianjin merchants continued to buy smoothly, and half because of the high price of Japanese rice, and if the situation deteriorated, wheat would be even scarcer, the bullish sentiment was mostly focused on this. As a final result, near and far terms consistently rose by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Although Wheat is Abundant, There are Still Concerns About Insufficiency <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, the opening in the morning was consistently stable. The quotation of foreign wheat rebounded by 0.2 to 0.5 to 0.6 yuan, so after the opening price, each month's share was raised by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. However, the transactions were not smooth, and the market situation was still fixed. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere in each month also suddenly became high because the flour market jumped and it was said that Tianjin helped to do flour very smoothly, so the market sentiment gradually became strong, and the asking price continued to be raised by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Judging from the recent situation, most of it is because although the national wheat is abundant, the annual needs are still insufficient, so once the flour sales are active, the market sentiment is difficult to suppress. The current wheat market is also healthy, and high-quality goods are raised by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Shandong Wuhe wheat opened at 5.33 yuan, Ruiwan wheat at 5.3 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 5 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 5.24 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 5.27 yuan. Shen Da bought 8,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was less than before, with a total of nearly 20 goods arriving, totaling 4,000 stone. Chang Gang's West New Early Rice has been launched, the rice quality is round, plump, and is indeed a good product, with a price opening at 10.07 yuan. The market situation of Bailiger Yao was that the opening price rose step by step due to the arrival of scarce and active sales. If Qingdao, Dalian, Longkou and other gang bought more than 400 bags, the result was that the market increased by 0.5 yuan. The new early rice market was the same, and the various new top-quality such as Duyang also followed up 0.3 yuan. However, judging from the phenomenon of the afternoon market, it seemed to have turned weak. This is because after the soaring prices for several consecutive days, there will eventually be a decline. As for the broken hull and thick rice, the price is slightly higher by 0.1 yuan. The thin rice was bought by the gang, with more than 400 bags bought, and the market improved by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Chenbian Yuan lacks goods and has no market, and the new Yin Yuan, on the contrary, has an oversupply and a unique drop of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang in Hexia was more than 120 numbers. The sales of various colors in the market were slightly less than before. The opening price in the morning was due to the residual power of the previous market, so each listed goods was raised and sold out. Broken rice continued to be tight at 0.3 yuan, the price of high-quality new early rice was increased by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Zhongjue suddenly rose by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and Zhong also increased by 0.2 yuan. Chenxin Sheep Sharp was also expensive at 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, so was the new Du Sharp. The Wharf Tip continued to add 0.1 yuan. Chenbian Yuan was stable, but the various colors turned stable in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Ke Xian Sales More Lively <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of Ke Xian suddenly became strong, but the arrival was scarce, and the market immediately skyrocketed. The arrival in the past two days was only thousands of bags, but yesterday the number of Japanese customers actually reached more than 20,000 bags, and there was purchasing from Tianjin and other northern gangs, and the situation was more lively. The route to Guangdong and Shantou was endless. In addition to the continuous procurement of the street, inland gangs also embellished, and the cargo owner was no longer as eager to sell as before. The price immediately rose 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. A total of more than 7,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 8,000 bags of Xiang rice, 4,235 bags of Han rice, and 400 to 5,000 bags of Taiwan, Guangdong and other machine rice were sold throughout the day. Most of the brown rice was bought by the Guangdong gang, while the machine rice was by the Northern and Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Yellow Soybean Market Strong <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The recent yellow soybean market has been quite stable, because there are not many goods coming and going, because the new goods are on the market, and only a small number are on the market, so the price of soybean oil in the market is strong, and the market has a good situation. Yesterday, the oil mills, foreign gangs, and the market bought more than 7,000 bags of new beans from each road.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Sesame, Foreign Merchants Buy Continuously <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The sesame market situation, the spot and futures go in opposite directions, the foreign merchants' term cargo transaction is still deserted, and it is temporarily less optimistic. The spot cargo is briskly sold by the Dongyang gang and the Nanyang Chengbenjie, so although the transaction is only 500 bags, the market is quite stable.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Piece Goods, Printed Cloth Sales Increase Daily, Fabric May Not Be Able to Keep Up, Japanese Factories Sell Out of December Futures, Chinese Factories Plan to Add Printing and Dyeing Finishing Departments <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market, the situation in this city has indeed turned mild, and the stable market is back to normal, but the standard yarn and flower are both weak, and the current yarn has fallen rapidly. The current cotton cloth price is very profitable based on the current flower price, but the brisk sales of goods is to be feared due to the lack of stock. The booking of the source of goods has been ordered one after another, and the weaving factory has ordered the most fabric, because the sales of printed and finished goods have increased daily in recent years, and printing and dyeing finishing factories have also emerged, and their business is very developed, resulting in a particularly strong demand for fabric, fearing that it may not be able to keep up, and the weaving factory's raw material is mostly East fine line, and it is extremely difficult to obtain current goods. The situation is now best in the Japanese factory, and the December futures have also been sold out. The fabric woven by the factory is also becoming increasingly popular, and the profit of fabric is sold at a far distance compared to fine and coarse cloths. There are also gradual attempts by Chinese textile factories to add printing, dyeing and finishing departments. It is heard that Minfeng, Jiashuang, and Dacheng are about to mature in three or four factories.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Metals　White Lead Sheets Sold Out Upon Arrival <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>White lead sheets are selling very well, and the arrivals are scarce. There are many buyers in the market, but very few sellers. Therefore, the market is quite brisk and poised to rise sharply. The prices for No. 2 grade are 152-153 yuan per barrel; Nos. 3 and 4, 134-135 yuan; No. 5, 128 yuan; Nos. 6 and 7, 124-125 yuan; No. 8, 127-128 yuan; Nos. 9 and 10, around 125 yuan, all up by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous market. The autumn sales of this product are very extensive, but due to the high prices last year, dealers purchased very little, resulting in a current scarcity of imports, and buyers have no stock. As a result, any newly arrived goods are quickly sold out. It was reported yesterday that Gong He Xiang and Xin Tai Gu’s warehouses received over 600 barrels, which were said to have been sold out. Battery factories and agents from other regions were the largest buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Silk and Tea: Silk Merchants Hesitant and Uncertain <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, international silk markets in New York and Yokohama showed mixed fluctuations. Ultimately, sluggish actual sales led to only slight changes. Yokohama spot prices fell by three yuan, while futures fell by one yuan. New York spot prices rose by one and a half points, while forward contracts fell by half a point. Japanese silk 75 and 83 evenness, as well as Shanghai silk 78 evenness, each fell by one point. East silk remained at its original price. In Lyon, financial instability and the devaluation of the French franc are expected to significantly impact French import trade. Consequently, sales of Chinese silk in France may also be somewhat affected. In the local silk market, unpredictable circumstances have created a hesitant and uncertain atmosphere, leading to a significant reduction in silk transactions. It is said that only 72 bales of both domestic and foreign silk were sold yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Green Tea Sales Show No Improvement <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market remained sluggish. European merchants, in response to the French franc devaluation, reduced prices for Moroccan orders by 20%. This made it difficult to proceed with transactions. Only Concord, Tongfu, and other firms purchased a total of over 200 boxes of needle, eyebrow, and pearl tea. Market prices trended downwards. According to a report from the tea warehouse trade association, the green tea market this week was particularly bleak. The reasons cited were the impact of the French franc devaluation, widespread rumors causing anxiety, low tea inventories, and a scarcity of high-quality tea. Foreign firms showed little interest in purchasing. The total sales for the week included 700 boxes of high-quality eyebrow tea, 300 boxes of small needle eyebrow tea, and several hundred boxes of Ping-Shui high-quality eyebrow tea. The market situation is likely to stall for some time.</p>
<h3 id="e166">North-South Goods: Second Batch of New Quanzhou Dried Longan Arrives in Shanghai – Walnut Sales Active…Market Sentiment Tight <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Large Dried Longan: Due to better development this year, the second batch of Quanzhou large dried longan, consisting of over 6,000 boxes, only arrived in Shanghai on the Yongsheng ship the day before yesterday. It is believed that the quantity is excessive, causing market fatigue. Sales have not yet begun. According to sources, the cost of this batch is high, preventing price reductions. It is likely to be released in stages to avoid market saturation.</p>
<p>Walnuts: Recently, due to active sales, the market sentiment has been quite good. Yesterday, Zhenbang firms sold over 330 packages of Jinan walnuts at 22 yuan. All firms accepted their allocated share, indicating a continued tightening of the market.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Sugar Market: Under-the-Table Trading of Miscellaneous Green Sugar Looks Promising <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten slightly. The trade association set the price for #24 coarse granulated sugar at 21.8 yuan for spot goods, up five cents. Re-exported goods were priced at 6.4 yuan. #8 East White sugar was priced at 21.4 yuan for spot goods, up one cent. #9 re-exported YRO mark was priced at 6 yuan, up one cent. Other prices remained unchanged. Cotton white sugar from local factories was priced at the original level. Chaozhou sugar firms only offered 42 packages of Cai Ji red sugar at 14.95 yuan and 49 packages of Fuquan red sugar at 15.65 yuan. Under-the-table trading of 100 packages of miscellaneous green sugar was reported, with the goods being of exceptional quality and priced one to two cents higher.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Spirit, Industry <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Jie</p>
<p>Spirit and industry have a close and inseparable relationship.</p>
<p>What is spirit? In broad terms, spirit can be divided into two types: one is the spirit of fearlessness, and the other is the spirit of diligent and enduring perseverance. The combination of these two types of spirit generates the "power" we need to undertake any endeavor. Let me provide a few examples: Consider individuals like the great inventor Thomas Edison and the great scientist Benjamin Franklin. Weren't their successes due to the power of their struggle? Consider groups of people like the French Revolution and the American Revolution. Weren't their successes also due to the power of their struggle? And this struggle is rooted in the two types of spirit mentioned above. Let's take Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution as an example. If Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not possess these two types of spirit, how could he have brought about the Xinhai Revolution? He would have succumbed to the numerous failures he faced along the way!</p>
<p>"Power" is the driving force behind successful endeavors. And only spirit can generate "power." Therefore, spirit and industry have a close and inseparable relationship.</p>
<p>Children, remember this! Spirit is unique to humankind. One unit of spirit yields one unit of industry.</p>

<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Emperor Ming Debates the Sun</p>
<p>When Emperor Ming of the Jin Dynasty was only a few years old, he was sitting on his father, Emperor Yuan's, lap one day. Someone arrived from Chang'an, reporting news from Luoyang. Emperor Yuan shed tears silently. Emperor Ming asked, "Why are you crying?" Emperor Yuan explained his intention to cross the river eastward in detail and casually asked him, "Do you think Chang'an is farther away, or the sun, my child?" He replied, "The sun is far away because we have never heard of anyone coming from the sun." Emperor Yuan was delighted to see that he had such insight at such a young age. The next day, Emperor Yuan held a gathering of officials and mentioned that conversation. He asked Emperor Ming the same question again in front of everyone. Unexpectedly, today, he replied that "the sun is near." Emperor Yuan's expression changed, likely because he wanted to show off his son's intelligence but ended up making a mess of things. He asked sternly, "Why is your answer different today from yesterday?" Emperor Ming slowly explained, "Upon closer reflection, we see the sun when we raise our eyes, but we cannot see Chang'an."</p>
<p>"How far away is the sun from us? How long a bamboo pole would it take to reach the sun?..." These questions have probably swirled in the young minds of many children. Sadly, even after consulting with adults, they remain unsatisfied! In fact, adults should seize the opportunity to patiently explain such knowledge that children naturally crave. The proportional question that Emperor Ming answered was merely his father testing his intellectual agility. His statement that the sun is far away was a theoretical concept, while his statement that the sun is near was a poetic expression. He did not fundamentally understand these concepts but was able to unknowingly reconcile them to justify his answers. That is why he can be called a "genius!"</p>
<h3 id="e170">France Trains Young Aviators <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The French government, recognizing the extremely dangerous and precarious times and the potential for a second European war, has determined that air power will be a primary force in any future conflict. Therefore, it has begun training young aviators. All children in schools, from ages nine to twenty-one, will undergo aviation training. The details of this plan have been finalized by the Minister of Aviation. France is initiating this aviation training for young students because its current pool of aviation personnel is insufficient to meet the demands of a potential world war. Additional young talent must be cultivated to fill the gaps. The training program will proceed in three stages.</p>
<p>First stage: Children ages nine to fourteen will receive introductory aviation knowledge.</p>
<p>Second stage: Children ages fourteen to seventeen will receive instruction in aviation science.</p>
<p>Third stage: Individuals ages eighteen to twenty-one will engage in practical flight training.</p>
<p>The Minister of Aviation of France has expressed that this training will greatly benefit both civilian and military aviation in France. It is also considered highly suitable for French youth. The Aviation Ministry will also establish a dedicated department to oversee this aviation training program. This training approach is cost-effective, but it will soon produce a large number of aviators, ensuring that all regions of France have aviation talent. Once training begins, periodic evaluations will be conducted. In short, French schools will soon implement aviation training, producing a vast number of young aviators.</p>

<p>— Chen Tiewu</p>
<p>Little fish, swimming in a cauldron,</p>
<p>Swimming to and fro, unaware of sorrow;</p>
<p>Happily relying on the iron walls for protection,</p>
<p>Unworried when enemies arrive.</p>
<p>Fish in a cauldron, growing anxious,</p>
<p>The heat around its body gradually rising;</p>
<p>Suddenly hearing a "hissing" sound from the bottom of the cauldron,</p>
<p>Hoping for a breeze to dispel the warmth.</p>
<p>Joy and anxiety side by side.</p>
<p>Fish in a cauldron, finally awakened,</p>
<p>Self-assessing, no longer anxious,</p>
<p>Leaping over the dragon gate, ten thousand feet high;</p>
<p>Drawing itself out with a jump,</p>
<p>The lid of the pot firmly closed,</p>
<p>Flailing around a couple of times,</p>
<p>Its life expires in a final gasp.</p>
<p>Children:</p>
<p>Think about it, take a look around,</p>
<p>Our environment,</p>
<p>Our surroundings,</p>
<p>Are they strangely similar to the fish in a cauldron?</p>
<p>Our property,</p>
<p>Our lives,</p>
<p>Are they as precarious as the fish in a cauldron?</p>

<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the emperor of one country sent an official document to another country, which read: "Send me a blue pig with a black tail; otherwise--" The emperor of the other country replied with his own official document, "I don't have such a pig; if I did--"</p>
<p>The emperors of both countries were angered and declared war on each other. They gathered large armies and fought dozens of bloody battles. Many brave soldiers died, and many women and children were left without food or clothing, and many froze or starved to death.</p>
<p>Later, the emperors of both countries realized that their military forces were evenly matched, that neither could defeat the other, and that continuing the fight was futile. They both felt it necessary to negotiate a truce. But the first problem to be solved was to clearly explain the meaning of the official documents, because the emperor of Country A was not satisfied with the reply from Country B, and the emperor of Country B was not satisfied with the demands of Country A!</p>
<p>The emperor of Country B asked: "What did you mean by asking me to send you a blue pig with a black tail? Otherwise what?"</p>
<p>"Why?" said the emperor of Country A: "My meaning is very simple, I asked you to send me a blue pig with a black tail, otherwise any other color would do."</p>
<p>"Ah! Is that so?" said Emperor B, "I regret that I did not receive the full content of your official document!"</p>
<p>"But I must ask you," said Emperor A, "What was the meaning of your reply! 'I don't have such a pig; if I did--' What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Emperor B, "My official document is as simple as yours. I said I don't have such a pig; if I did, I could send it to you." "Alright! Alright!" said Emperor A, "We have fought a war in vain. If we had properly explained ourselves before the war, wouldn't all the losses and all the suffering have been avoided?"</p>
<p>Later, the emperors of both countries recorded this "black-tailed blue pig" war in their historical records, so that everyone would be vigilant at all times and avoid the recurrence of similarly pointless wars.</p>

<p>— Jun Qi</p>
<p>Children! When we wake up in the morning, we must do a cleaning job of washing our faces and brushing our teeth, only then will we feel comfortable, this is due to the cleanliness of our skin. A person's skin has the function of regulating body temperature. Strong skin, able to withstand cold and heat, will become stronger and healthier day by day, and the spirit will be happy.</p>
<p>If we want to protect our bodies, we must first exercise our skin, and there are many ways to do this, with cold water washing being the best. However, there must be training, and it will take time to take effect; otherwise, not only will the body not become stronger, but serious diseases may also occur, which is something to pay close attention to. Therefore, before practicing the habit of cold water washing, the initial basic training is to wash the face with cold water: on the one hand, it is easy to train, and on the other hand, it will not cause disease.</p>
<p>Although cold water washing only involves two small parts, the hands and the face, because they are often in direct contact with the air, they should be exercised first, and then gradually to the whole body, then the good habit of cold water washing will be successful.</p>
<p>It is best to start washing your face with cold water in the summer. As the weather gets colder, we must still stick to our principles and persevere to the end. If we can survive the severe winter, after this habit is formed, not only will the skin become firm, but the body will also increase its health. This is very beneficial for children. I hope all children will strive to put it into practice!</p>

<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Fuyue, of course, was playing and jumping happily in his own yard, just like all the children, holding mooncakes in his hands, eating and laughing, shouting: "Moon! Moon! You look like a basin, like a bowl, come down and play!" Sitting on the chair, Fuyue's father pointed at the moon in the sky and said, "Fuyue! Do you know why the moon on Mid-Autumn Festival feels especially bright compared to any other full moon?" Fuyue was silent, and his father continued: "This is because the autumn night is clear and cool." Fuyue asked: "Where did the moon come from?" His father smiled and said: "The origin of the moon is really incredible. Millions and millions of years ago, the sun was rotating very fast in the sky, and because of the vibration of the rotation, a large piece separated and stood in the sky separately, following the sun and constantly rotating, and because of the rotation force being very far, the shape gradually became elliptical, this is the Earth". Later, the "Earth" was also like the sun. Tens of millions of years after the "Earth", because it was not a fireball, it gradually cooled down, but a small lump that looked like a wart grew on the surface of the "Earth" and gradually grew larger. Subjected to the vibration of rotation and the wave action of the sun, it suddenly left the "Earth" and rotated around the "Earth" constantly, also forming another one in the sky, this is the moon". Its volume is five thousand cubic miles, the diameter is three thousand four hundred and seventy-six, the distance from "Earth" is three hundred and eighty-four thousand and four hundred kilometers. To think of going to the moon for a walk, it would take more than a hundred days by plane and more than three hundred days by train, but it's only ideal, it is definitely impossible."</p>
<p>Fuyue's father, took a cigarette, and continued: "The light of the moon is reflected from the direct sunlight to the "Earth", as many as four billion lights. The brightest place we see is the volcano, and the darker places like mountains are the valleys and the sea. On the moon, half a month is daytime, and half a month is nighttime. The temperature during the day is above a hundred degrees, and at night it suddenly drops to hundreds of degrees below zero, so there is basically no atmosphere or water layer, and life goes without saying. The moon grows round from the first to the fifteenth of the month, and it decreases from the sixteenth to the thirtieth. Because of the different positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon at times, sometimes the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth, just in a parallel line, which becomes a solar eclipse. The Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, also in a parallel line, which becomes a lunar eclipse."</p>
<p>The above conversation was heard when I went to Fuyue's house to play on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. I felt that it was very interesting and valuable, so I introduced it to everyone. I believe the children must be happy to hear it!</p>

<p>— Zhong Mei</p>
<p>Since Xiao Min asked Xiao Yong for a pair of pigeons during the summer vacation, he has been very careful to bathe them, feed them, clean the pigeon loft, etc. every day, so in the past two months, the pair of pigeons have grown very fat. Who wouldn't like the snow-white feathers lined with crimson eyes?</p>
<p>One day, when Xiao Min was working for them, his younger brother Ren'er asked him, "Brother Min, what kinds of pigeons are there in our poultry?" Xiao Min cleaned the pigeon loft while answering in a low voice, "Brother Ren, as far as I know, there are five kinds: first, eye-circle pigeons, second, pouter pigeons, third, carrier pigeons, fourth, wild pigeons, and fifth, peacock pigeons.</p>
<p>Brother Min, what are the uses of the pigeons you just mentioned? The uses of the pigeons I just mentioned are: 1. Eye-circle pigeons: around their eyes, like people wearing glasses, there is a layer of shiny things, so they are called eye-circle pigeons. In addition to being used for playing and raising, their eggs and meat can be eaten. 2. Pouter pigeons: Their chests are protruding, so they are called pouter pigeons. There is no difference between their use and that of eye-circle pigeons. 3. Carrier pigeons: Because of their strong memory and ability to fly back and forth from very far places, they are used to transmit messages in the army. 4. Wild pigeons: Their meat and eggs can be eaten, and other internal organs and feathers can be used as fertilizer. 5. Peacock pigeons: Their tail feathers are very long and can be opened and folded like a peacock, so they are called peacock pigeons. Their use is the same as that of eye-circle pigeons.</p>
<p>Brother Min, what are the differences between pigeons and chickens?</p>
<p>The differences between pigeons and chickens, in short, there are several points. Let's talk about pigeons first: 1. The beak is covered with soft skin except at the front end. 2. The hind limbs are very short and small. Male pigeons do not have spurs. 3. They are intelligent and easy to tame and do not like to fight. 4. It is not easy to tell the difference between male and female pigeons. 5. The wings are large and sharp, and they fly very fast. 6. They like to eat fruits and grains. As for chickens, 1. The entire beak is very hard and not covered with soft skin. 2. The hind limbs are strong, and the males have spurs. 3. They like to fight. 4. It is easy to tell the difference between male and female chickens. 5. The wings are short and cannot fly. 6. They like to eat insects, grains, and fruits.</p>

<p>— Zhang Junxin of the Xin'an Travel Group</p>
<p>(My First Time in Shanghai)</p>
<p>'Shanghai is a very gorgeous and complex' city, there are many people, and foreign houses are everywhere'. I often hear people say this, but I, an old man from Jiangbei, have never been to this prosperous Shanghai. This time it's really an unexpected trip to Shanghai. How happy is this?</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day after arriving here, I found a few classmates to go out and see the sights. After walking a lot, I felt very strange; why is it not lively here? Just as I was wondering, one of my classmates said to me, "Hey! Don't you know? This is Jing'an Temple Road, so the first section should be quiet!", At this time, I thought to myself, that's true, there is even some foreign writing on the sign of Jing'an Temple Road in front, so it should be quiet here. Only then did I realize, no wonder there were only one man and one woman walking slowly, not even daring to speak loudly. In fact, there was also a car moving around. We walked forward again, and when we got to a place, a person suddenly came from the opposite side and shouted, 'Jiangbei pigs!' I asked my classmate again, "What does the word 'pigs' mean?" My classmate said, "It's cursing people." I said, "That's really strange, why does calling someone 'pigs' curse them?" This classmate said, "'Pigs' is what the locals here use to scold people from Jiangbei, but people from Jiangbei also scold people here, calling them 'chilao'!" Oh, I realized that "chilao" is what Shanghai people call "pigs" to scold people from Jiangbei. Not far away, I said, "Why are there so many foreigners here?" My classmate said: "Because this is a concession." At this time, I wondered again, why are there British concessions and French concessions? My classmate said to me again: "A concession is a Chinese place rented to England or rented to other countries, this is called a concession. So I asked, "How many concessions do we Chinese have in foreign countries?" My classmate said, "Do we Chinese still want to have concessions in foreign countries?" I asked again, "Why?" My classmate said, "It is because stronger countries always have concessions abroad." I thought to myself, why do stronger countries have concessions, and weaker nations have their land rented out to others? Isn't China a country whose land has been rented out to others? Isn't it also a weak nation?</p>

<p>She checked the potatoes she had stored among the ferns outside again, thinking that if she brought them all into the house, the heat from the fireplace might spoil them. So, she only took a few, enough for them to eat one meal. Afterwards, she went to the cow and milked it, but the poor old creature was hungry, so it didn't give much milk, not enough to fully supply them. An Ge Ni knew she had to give it some hay. So, she called her two younger brothers to help her climb into the attic and start pulling down the hay, but they were just small children, and the work was too difficult. As night fell, the attic was pitch black, frightening the two younger brothers. Little An Ge Ni had to do it herself, pulling down a lot of hay, feeding the old cow until it was full, and bedding it down properly. Soon it was dinnertime, and the sisters gathered together, filling their stomachs. After the meal, An Ge Ni, just like the night before, undressed her twin little sisters, put them to bed, and sang them songs to soothe them to sleep. Seeing that they were all asleep, she and the rest of her siblings sat around the fireplace, waiting for their parents to return, listening intently for the sound of their loved ones outside the door, hour after hour. Sometimes, it seemed like they heard footsteps in the wind, and they would all hold their breath, waiting intently. After a while, the wind would pass, and everything would be as silent as death again. The snow was falling heavily again that night. An Ge Ni was careful to keep the doors and windows from being blocked by snow, and she was also careful about the fire in the fireplace, lest it be extinguished by the snow blowing down the chimney. She kept watch until midnight again, but still, she didn't see her father and mother return, nor did anyone else come to help them. She had no other choice but to go to bed. When she woke up, she saw that the snow was falling even heavier, dashing her last hope. Her dear and lively mother, and her strong and courageous father, were both good climbers. If they hadn't encountered any accidents, they would have returned long ago, after these two days. Poor little An Ge Ni barely made it to the third day, caring for her siblings as usual, everyone constantly praying, hoping that their parents would return home safe and sound.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fourth day, the snow had stopped, and the wind had changed direction. Much of the snow on the ground had been blown away. An Ge Ni immediately perked up. She and her sisters went out together, following a low stone wall, heading towards Grasmere. She avoided the danger of crossing the creek bridge and took a detour instead. They walked for a while and reached the mountain ridge. An Ge Ni quickly sent her siblings back and bravely continued forward alone, trudging through the vast snowy hillside, only wanting to find her parents, forgetting all the dangers, finally arriving at the door of the house closest to Grasmere.</p>
<p>An Ge Ni knocked on the door, and the people inside opened the door and welcomed her, but when she asked about her father and mother, their smiles immediately turned into worried expressions. Within half an hour, the news of the disappearance of the George Green couple had spread throughout the valley, and sixty strong men gathered in Gouke Town and set out together to search for them. According to the last people who saw them, after the auction that day, several friends had advised them not to walk the dangerous mountain road at night, but after they parted ways, their whereabouts were unknown. Some residents of Lantai said that they seemed to have heard shouts in the middle of the night, but they thought it was just the wind blowing, so they didn't pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Miniature Model of the Officialdom Scene a Century Ago <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Fengshi</p>
<p>"Shanghai has everything," no one can deny this saying. Recently, there is another fascinating place that makes everyone who sees it marvel, that is the "Family Miniature Model" on display on the fourth floor of the Great Sun Department Store. There is a full set of old-fashioned dowry, old-fashioned wedding hall and bridal chamber arrangement; a full set of civil and military official escorts for the old-fashioned grand funeral; the style of the ancestral hall; old-fashioned longevity hall, banquet hall, flower hall; temporary stage; a pleasure boat for lake tours; a Suzhou-style kitchen; and various application furniture. Even the Suzhou-style food peddlers shouting along the street and their respective utensils are all available, complete in every detail. This model vividly brings the old antiques of the old-fashioned patriarchal society of a century ago into the eyes of us Shanghai people who are full of Europeanization, making us naturally think of the past situation of the official families of the late Qing Dynasty, and we can't help but feel the feeling of where are they now.</p>
<p>This is a retired Qing Dynasty military officer named Zhou, who has lived in Suzhou for a long time. According to the title of his small honor guard, this gentleman is called Shaofu, and his name is Zhou Dunhoutang. This gentleman has no special hobbies in his life, and almost devotes his entire energy to this "small thing". Don't look at these small models; the materials used are: copper, iron, glass, wood, silk, porcelain, leather, paper, ... No matter what the material, it must be prepared, customized, fired, mounted, and sewn according to the real thing. It is comparable to imitating the porcelain of Jingdezhen, the paper of Xuanzhou, the silk of Huzhou, ... etc. No matter the value, it must be made locally. Therefore, the price of these small toys is often dozens or hundreds of times that of the real big toys? Moreover, that kind of unreserved, uncompromising realism is even more exhaustive!</p>
<p>Entering the door of the exhibition hall, we first see a painted boat. Anyone who has been to Suzhou and Wuxi will immediately think of its popular name called "Wuxi Kuai". At the same time, they will also think of the scene of "singing and dancing boats, hairpin shadows wave first" in the previous prosperous times? Although this boat is a prototype, it is eight or nine feet long. The whole body is made of real tung oil and high-quality wood. It is divided into five cabins. The first cabin at the bow is arranged as an open hall, except for the deck at the entrance. The entrance to the cabin is decorated with five-color glass (it seems to be glazed tiles), and the sides are equipped with water pavilion-style screen doors with flower boards and glass windows. In front of it are arranged four sets of master chairs and tea tables. The top is a bright tile ceiling, and under it are hung many hexagonal rectangular high-legged gauze lanterns, and colorful balls are tied. A lamp in the center is like a Western-style safety kerosene lamp, hanging lower. In the open hall, there is a table for eight immortals, with chairs and tables, and a set of mahjong tiles. The mahjong tiles are small, but they are all made of real ivory and bamboo backs, with dice and zhuangzi complete. The covered teacups and water pipes are also fully equipped on the table. In the middle cabin, separated by a large glass screen door, the layout is slightly the same as the open hall, but this cabin is a dining room, with a round table in the center. The table is equipped with hot pot bowls, basins, hand dishes, chopsticks, and spoons. The tables and chairs are also brightly painted. Entering the inner part of the dining room through the screen door, it is a place for lying down and traveling, equipped with a pit table, pit cushions, large spittoons, foot pedals, etc., which are arranged in the usual way, without any omissions. In addition to the straw mat, there is also a terrace on the roof of the middle and rear cabins, which is prepared for tourists to climb up and take a look. Its shape is like a sun deck, but it is very elegant, and the four pillars are hung with bright lights. In the rear cabin, the items used by the boatmen are also fully equipped. The mast, rudder, oar, paddle, pole, anchor, etc. in the boat are all like the real thing. If it is placed in the middle of the river, it will definitely move freely and be gorgeous and pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>The wedding hall (see Figure 1) is three feet high and four feet long, and the lower part is an open hall with three large bays in front and back, which is a miniature of the hall of an old-fashioned official family. The upper floor is divided into three rooms. The middle is the ancestral hall, the left is the bridal chamber, and the right is the companion's bedroom and the place where the bride's boxes are placed together. In addition to two large jujube red lacquered quilt boxes, there are also twelve large and small vermilion lacquered clothing boxes, etc., which are arranged in the room according to the law. The bright and gorgeous arrangement of the bridal chamber is so dazzling that, in short, it has all the beauty and is not lacking in splendor. The full set of dowry is placed in the wedding hall downstairs. All the old-fashioned vermilion lacquered gaily boxes are displayed in dozens of frames. The silk and satin, clothes, shoes, and socks are all colorful and magnificent. What is especially interesting is the vermilion lacquer so-called descendants bucket - the toilet, which is completely in accordance with the custom, with dozens of large and small ones, and all of them are edged with high-grade red lacquer and gold.</p>
<p>The size of the longevity hall is slightly like the wedding hall, and the furniture is completely made of mahogany. But there is no building. Longevity banners and couplets are hung all over it, with lanterns and colors, and gold characters compete with red candles, reflecting each other, and there is indeed a feeling of longevity for the eyes and a hall full of gold and jade. Although the equipment in the back hall is relatively simple, there are dining tables, pit beds, and account tables. The four treasures of the study and abacus are arranged in a small row, which is very interesting. In front of the longevity hall is an ancestral hall gatehouse. It is slightly like a temple gate, but there are no clay sculptures. However, the four walls of the gatehouse are surrounded by countless plaques, all of which are in pairs on the left and right. Such as hereditary Hanlin Academy, Doctor of Jingjing, Wugong General, rewarded with peacock feathers...etc. Beside the ancestral hall, there is also a water pavilion, a cool pavilion, and a flower hall. Next to it is a Suzhou-style official kitchen (see Figure), which is divided into three questions. Two-thirds of the area is the kitchen. The northernmost big stove has a large pot and soup. In addition to the stove, the dishes, bowls, cupboards and various kitchen utensils, firewood, rice, oil and salt, seven things, are arranged neatly in different positions. The other third of the place is a room where the father and the servant eat; a question from the servant's bedroom, on which there is a small loft. The things used by the servants. The sundries are very detailed. Corresponding to the same place is a collection of peddler's loads. Compared with the rich people's supplies mentioned earlier, they are all detailed, and the peddler's supplies are completely rough goods. All the burdens of selling fried white fruits, selling rice wine, wontons, soup balls, baked sweet potatoes, etc., are all equipped with shoulder poles and rain gear. In addition, there is also a century-old open-air stage, which is a public entertainment temple fair style. The entrance of the stage is full of name plates of famous actors a century ago, and there are two cloth-tied people on the stage, one is in the shape of the Monkey King, and the other is in the shape of a golden-faced monster playing steel, who is originally playing Da Jinqian Leopard.</p>

<p>The most distinctive feature is the grand funeral honor guard. In total, there are more than 200 items, such as door guns, flags, paired plaques, inscriptions, Danqi pavilions, etc., including 20 kinds of pavilions, 4 or 5 kinds of umbrellas, 3 or 4 kinds of sedan chairs, as well as eighteen kinds of weapons, various funeral banners, gongs and drums, musical instruments, etc., all of which are about ten times smaller than the real ones, and the length has been extended to four feet. Finally, there is the mourning hall, with the spiritual seat in the middle, and dozens of elegiac couplets hanging beside it. In fact, these are all jokes made by this old gentleman Shaofu, so someone gave the horizontal plaque of the mourning hall the four characters "Dream Awakening Huang Liang". There are two elegiac couplets that say it well. One says: "It is small, the real honor guard is really worth seeing; it is a play, it is a joke, a fake funeral is a fake sadness." The second says: "This world must know that everything is a dream, who does not see it as such?" After reading these two couplets, everyone will probably say that they are just right?</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Whether your future is dark or bright, laugh once first, otherwise, I'm afraid you won't have the chance to laugh before you die.</p>
<p>There are many things in the world that really make you dizzy and forget to eat and sleep before you get them; but after you get them, you feel bored and more boring than you hoped! ——This can be tasted a little from the desire to be a "great man".</p>
<p>Life is short and boring if it is always going on in "hoping for the future"; because of this, all ideals and happiness are placed on the unknowable "future", and by that time, the previous ideals and happiness have disappeared, because one's health and youth have long been different from the past. At this time, we hope for the front again, but the front is still not the place we want to go... So we always hope, always disappoint, and life becomes a tiring outline.</p>
<p>Some people say that the reason why people all over the world cannot form a country, cannot speak the same language, cannot abide by one law, and cannot have the same culture and habits is that they have fundamental differences in spirit, hobbies, and emotions. But I am very surprised, why are there still families of eight or nine people in the world who can live together lovingly and harmoniously under one roof?</p>
<p>Everyone says that people are selfish and that the world is difficult. We only see that everyone always wants to deceive others and is unwilling to be deceived. Everything of their own is always raised very high, and everything of others is always depreciated very low, and even the smallest thing in the world must take a lot of effort to succeed. But where do marriages, contracts, peace, armistice agreements, mutual agreements, and all alliances in the world come from?</p>

<h3 id="e185">From the "Small Army" Theory to the "Total War" Theory <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shaochuan</p>
<p>After the last World War, the most popular theory in the study of tactics was the so-called "small army" theory. People such as Fuller of England, Douhet of Italy, and Seeckt of Germany were all famous military commentators, but they were also advocates of the "small army" theory. According to them, in future wars, it would be unnecessary to arm the entire nation or the broad masses of the people; because with the development of weapons and the advancement of military technology, it would only be necessary to use a small corps equipped with the latest weapons to penetrate deep into the enemy's territory, deliver a devastating blow, and victory could be achieved. Douhet believed that as long as fifteen hundred bombers carrying five or six thousand tons of bombs were used to destroy the enemy's air force bases, seize air supremacy, and deliver a devastating blow to the heart of the enemy country, the issue of victory or defeat would be resolved. Fuller advocated using a mechanized small army of ten thousand men, carrying two thousand tanks, four hundred motorized artillery pieces, and hundreds of aircraft to break through the enemy's lines, invade the enemy country, in order to seize victory and end the war. The famous Italian assault warfare theorist Amedeo Mecozzi also believed that "the key to surprise" had a decisive effect on the war situation, and therefore he advocated using a small army to invade the enemy's rear to achieve victory. From the perspective of such a "small army" theory, future wars would not be protracted, nor would they involve great sacrifices; in fact, the advocates of the "small army" theory often told the general public: future wars would only require a small number of elite troops, and would achieve victory through "surprise attacks" in a very short period of time, so they would definitely not be as cruel as the last World War.</p>
<p>Such a "small army" theory was of course not conjured out of thin air by those military commentators; its emergence was based on certain social foundations. This can be explained in the following points.</p>
<p>First, during the World War of 1914-18, the people of many capitalist countries awakened and turned around, causing those countries to experience serious domestic wars, almost resulting in the end of capitalism. After the end of the war, the imperialist powers, in order to compete for markets, prepared even more actively for the Second World War; but on the other hand, they were afraid of the "unfortunate" events that occurred in the last war repeating themselves, so they did not dare to arm the entire nation, and created the "small army" theory; at the same time, they also told everyone: the Second World War would definitely be short in duration, and would not be as cruel as the last World War, attempting to deceive everyone, so that people's anti-war thoughts would be shaken.</p>
<p>Second, the Treaty of Versailles, established after the war, stipulated on the one hand that countries such as Germany and Austria could not rearm, and on the other hand created a powerful force within the Versailles system: this made those military commentators believe that a total mobilization war between imperialists would not occur; even if a world war did occur, it would only be a mechanized "small army" assault war, and a war mobilizing the entire country was not really necessary. At the same time, the theory of "small army" assaults on strongholds, aggression against colonies, and attacks on new countries arose in response to the times.</p>
<p>Third, the emergence of the "small army" theory also had a deep relationship with the national conditions of certain countries. For example, Douhet's theory of aerial warfare originated from Italy, which was inferior to other imperialist powers in all aspects. Because Italy's economy and military were more backward compared to countries such as Britain and France; at the same time, its position was also relatively unfavorable, and the so-called "prisoner of the Mediterranean" was its title; therefore, Douhet created his theory in an attempt to use the latest military technology—aircraft—to save and develop Italy. Also, Fuller's proposition was also suitable for Britain's special situation. Because the British Empire possessed vast colonies around the world, it was impossible for it to use a large army to protect them; what was important to it was the navy and air force; and Fuller's proposition was precisely for this point.</p>
<p>However, the current situation is completely different. With the development of contradictions between the powers, the competition for military expansion among countries, and the destruction of international treaties, not only has the issue of the Second World War become increasingly realistic, but also in various facts it has been made clear that this war will inevitably be more cruel than the last one, and the strength between the belligerent countries will inevitably be stronger, and the so-called "small army" theory has already gone bankrupt in practice. Now, both Germany and Italy, the birthplaces of this theory, are in total mobilization, and no one will pay attention to that kind of "small army" theory anymore. Facts tell us: Germany has created an army of more than a million; once a war breaks out, not only all men, but also all women will be mobilized. As for Italy, when it launched its expedition to East Africa, it actually mobilized an army of more than a million; last year, Italy also stipulated that citizens should receive military education from the age of eight; Mussolini recently made a public and boastful declaration to the world, saying that once something happens, Italy can mobilize an army of more than eight million in a short period of time! In addition, countries such as Poland, France, Britain, and Japan are also working hard on total mobilization. In this way, the so-called "small army" theory has been replaced by "total war."</p>
<p>The so-called "total war" is the highest expression of the military wisdom of militarism. In the current Germany, Italy, and other militarist countries, books discussing "total war" are very popular. The so-called "annihilation war," "war science," "total war," and "total victory" are the most fashionable topics of Hitler and Mussolini's military spokespersons. At the same time, in German and Italian schools, professors of certain subjects mostly lecture students on "total war" and related theories. In this way, "total war" has become inseparable from the current political system in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>So, what is the meaning of "total war"? What is its content? According to the explanations of military commentators in Germany, Italy, and other countries, it is: first, not only to send the entire country's army to the battlefield, but also to have the entire nation participate in the war, not only to carry out military mobilization, but also to have the economic and "spiritual" total mobilization of the entire nation; second, occupying a certain place is not for political purposes, but for the purpose of completely annihilating the enemy; third, "total war" is a war conducted with the determination to fight to the death, using all possible means, without limitation and without forgiveness. Ludendorff, the author of "Total War," said: "...During the World War, the belligerent countries had to wage war in a combat zone of several kilometers; like the war itself, it would exhaust the residents near the war zone; in this complete sense, the battlefield would inevitably expand to the entire territory of the belligerent countries. Not only the army, but also the people must directly participate in the war, although their participation differs somewhat in form and degree. ...Total war, not only for the armed forces, but also for the nation, must directly conduct war. ...Total war will actually pose a fatal threat to the entire nation...." This is the essence of "total war."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the relationship between war and politics, theorists of "total war" also have special explanations. For example, Ludendorff argued:</p>
<p>"...The essence of war has changed, the essence of politics has changed, and thus the political relationship for military guidance has also changed. ...War and politics are used to maintain the life of the nation, and war is an even higher expression of the nation's desire to survive. Therefore, politics must serve the guidance of the military." According to his argument, both domestic and foreign politics must serve war, and in this regard there is the so-called "total politics."</p>
<p>On this issue of the relationship between war and politics, although the opinions of military commentators have some differences, they are all equally devoted to supporting "total war" and "total politics."</p>
<p>As for the significance of victory in "total war," according to those military commentators, it lies in completely and permanently conquering the enemy and enslaving other nations. One "total war" theorist said: "The future war will not only be total in the sense of the use of force, but also in the far-reaching nature of the results. In other words, the total victory means the total destruction of the loser, which is the complete and thorough elimination of the defeated from the historical arena of competition. ...In this kind of war, there are only victors and vanquished, only survivors and nations that are removed from the national register. This war does not end by legal means, but by the cessation of military action in fact. ..." According to this statement, if the general public does not rise up to fight for the imperialists desperately, then their nation will be in danger of being permanently eliminated: this is obviously a deliberate exaggeration by the militarists, attempting to incite their people to rise up and fight for them, to conquer others and enslave other nations.</p>
<p>However, no matter what, "total war" always has great inherent dangers; that is, in the total mobilization of the entire nation, in the development and prolongation of a cruel war, the majority of the people in the aggressor countries will inevitably gradually awaken, use the weapons given to them by the aggressors to oppose the war of aggression, and to strive for their own freedom and liberation, in order to achieve permanent human harmony. Such a terrible event was something that the imperialists experienced during the last World War.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Therefore, while they are singing the "songs of total war," on the other hand they are also raising the issue of the organization of the wartime army and the thinking of the army and the general public. They advocate incorporating the sons of wealthy families and soldiers who have received strict training in peacetime into ordinary troops to play a leading role, and also advocate using various effective methods to publicize and train ordinary soldiers, so that they can resolutely fight for the motherland and to forever conquer others in order to gain final victory. At the same time, they also implement strict surveillance and oppression of the general public. The aforementioned Ludendorff once openly shouted: "Of course, the state, that is, the military leadership of total politics and total war, must adopt special measures. For example, strict review of newspapers and magazines, strict laws to maintain military secrets, sealing off borders connecting with neutral countries, prohibiting gatherings, and at least arresting the heads of 'dissenting factions,' and strictly monitoring railway transportation and wireless telephone broadcasts." However, people strive for their own interests and for the truth they believe in; we believe that even under the severe oppression and various deceptions of imperialism, the majority of their people will not forget their own interests and the truth they should know: therefore, in the development of "total war," the majority of the people of imperialism will inevitably experience greater suffering and greater resistance, and the crisis of imperialism will naturally be even greater.</p>
<p>Thus, the development from "small army" to "total war" can be said to be the development of the imperialist aggression, and at the same time it is the development of their crisis.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Gazing at Chang'e Through a Telescope: Talking About the Moon During Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Among all the Chinese festivals, the Mid-Autumn Festival is probably the most interesting and poetic; although according to folklore researchers, the commemoration of the Mid-Autumn Festival originated from "killing the Tatars," it has completely become a day to worship the moon god.</p>
<p>The moon, in the eyes of most people, is indeed a very mysterious thing. In various countries around the world, there are all kinds of stories and legends about the moon, and these legends and stories are more beautiful and gentle than those of other festivals. Just in our country, some say that in that jade palace in the heavens there lives a beautiful woman who stole the elixir of immortality, named Chang'e; others say that there is only a rabbit living there, whose job is to pound medicine day and night; others say that there is also an old man there chopping cassia trees. As for the West, some say that there is a goddess who makes a living by hunting, riding deer and galloping on the icy and flawless moon all day long; others say that there are flocks of sheep on the moon, giant crabs, and young girls reading books, and so on. People on Earth often hope to go and see this mysterious place, so in legends there are beautiful stories such as Emperor Ming of Tang visiting the Moon Palace. In my hometown, there is also the custom of "watching the moon's radiance" during the Mid-Autumn Festival, saying that at midnight, when all is silent, the Moon Palace opens with a bang, and colorful carriages emerge in single file, as the princess is being married off to another planet; those who see this grand wedding will surely have great luck.</p>
<p>In fact, if we had such a high ladder that we could climb onto the moon to take a look, these wonderful illusions would be immediately shattered.</p>
<p>The moon is only three hundred eighty-four, three hundred ninety-five kilometers away from the earth, which is connecting thirty Earths in a row, or taking a path circling the Earth ten times as long, one can reach the moon. However, our naked eyes cannot clearly see things at such a long distance, so even on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, when the air is clearest and the moonlight is brightest, we can only see a round jade plate emitting a gentle blue light; looking more closely, we can only see some black patches on it that resemble various figures; rationally and reasonably, the legends of beauties, rabbits, deer, and so on in the Moon Palace must have come from imagining these black patches.</p>
<p>So, what exactly are these black patches?</p>
<p>Professor Pickering, an authority on lunar research, once used the world's largest telescope at the Wilson Mountain Observatory in the United States to take a large photograph of the moon's surface with a diameter of thirty inches. From this photograph, we see that the moon is not only not as smooth as jade or a mirror, but also uneven, with seas, mountains, valleys, and countless round holes; however, these seas, mountains, holes, and valleys are not as beautiful as those on our Earth. Because there is no air or dust on the moon, the places hit by sunlight will not reflect, and apart from those places that dazzle the eyes, the rest of the area is as dark as if it were in the middle of the night. From the Earth, it was originally such a bright and pure round moon, but when it loses the sunlight, it becomes a dark mass. Moreover, there is no water on the moon, so there are no changeable clouds, and even if there are high mountains, there are no rushing waterfalls, and even if there are valleys, there are no trickling streams. As for the scene of vast plains, misty and foggy, with mountains and wild grasses like carpets, that is even more non-existent. How monotonous! How desolate! Some say that even during the day on the moon, its temperature is still below freezing, and even if there is a small amount of water, it would have frozen into ice and snow long ago; the white, hazy thing we see on the moon's surface in our telescopes may be the covering of ice and snow. Also, if we really had the ability to fly to the moon with two or three friends, but because there is no air on the moon, we would lose the medium for sound transmission, and we could not hear each other even if we spoke face to face.</p>
<p>Continued on the Fifth Edition</p>

<p>Everyone would suddenly become mute. In addition to this difficulty, there is also the danger of being hit by meteors at all times; these meteors sometimes also fall on the Earth, but because there is a thick layer of air surrounding the Earth, when a meteor falls, this layer of air reduces its momentum a lot, and it collides with the air, forcing it to split into many fragments, and then the danger is avoided; but on the moon, these meteors, without any obstacles, fall down like artillery shells without any mercy.</p>
<p>On this icy and snowy moon, since there are no rivers or trees, living things certainly cannot grow, so on the moon, apart from rocks, caves, and high mountains, there is almost nothing. Some scholars say that many years ago, the moon was also alive like the Earth, and could produce all things, but now it is dead—completely dead—the light it emits is not actually its own light, and if we carefully analyze this gentle light, we can know that its color is exactly the same as sunlight; this shows that moonlight is just the light reflected from the sun. But why is moonlight not as strong as sunlight? This is because it does not reflect all of the sunlight, but only one-tenth of it.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival of the 25th year of the Republic of China has arrived again. Now that we know all the sights on the moon, we should no longer be deceived by the illusions of those black patches, right?</p>

<h3 id="e187">Pure Discussion and Idle Talk <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>It seems that historically, whenever a nation faces times of turmoil, a segment of scholars, intellectuals, and literati invariably engages in "pure discussion," expressing dissatisfaction with the current state, whether through direct remonstrance or indirect satire. Conversely, others engage in "idle talk." Naturally, they too are dissatisfied with the status quo, but they adopt a passive attitude, remaining indifferent to national affairs, spending their days drinking wine, composing poetry, and wandering among mountains and rivers. Later generations have offered many commentaries on these two types of people. Regarding the former, some say they were able to disregard the threat of punishment and devote themselves to national affairs, while others say they were asking for trouble and acting unnecessarily. Regarding the latter, some say they only sought to "preserve their own purity," disregarding important national matters and thus failing to be true men, while others say they were capable of "avoiding danger and disaster," and could be considered "reclusive scholars."</p>
<p>However, regardless of the debate, those who engaged in "pure discussion" continued to do so, and those who engaged in "idle talk" continued to do so. But as far as we know, idle talk was indeed more advantageous than pure discussion. Idle talkers, of course, sometimes, in their conversations, couldn't completely suppress their inner resentment, and inadvertently revealed a bit of "misanthropy and cynicism," which could lead to execution. But for the most part, as long as you were "cautious and careful," you could always "preserve your head" or "live out your days as a farmer." But those who engaged in pure discussion did not have it so easy. Among them, if you were truly engaged in "pure" discussion, and not "turbid" discussion, then rarely would you avoid being "thrown into the turbid waters along with your kind." The most obvious example is the Donglin Party of the Ming Dynasty. Precisely because of this, the number of people engaging in pure discussion gradually decreased, and precisely because of this, the number of people engaging in idle talk gradually increased.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove of the Jin Dynasty, such as Ji Kang, Ruan Ji, and Liu Ling, were the founding fathers of our idle talk circles. Some of them indulged in wine and women, while others immersed themselves in poetry and prose. Generally, when they met, they would always boast and chat. What they talked about was nothing more than literary compositions, drunken women, or impersonal topics such as "the vastness of the heavens and earth, the insignificance of a fly." Their words were "incoherent and illogical," and their behavior was "unrestrained," seeming drunk, foolish, crazy, and mad. People like this were truly "doing nothing." If the whole country were like this, then no one would be doing anything, and it would truly be "idle talk ruining the country!"</p>
<p>Strangely enough, since you cannot engage in "pure discussion," then you should be well-behaved, eat your food, wear your clothes, and sleep your sleep. Why must you nag and chatter? Sometimes, unintentionally, you not only fail to entertain the country, but also endanger your own life, which is truly incomplete. We seem to remember that Ji Kang was also "beheaded in the marketplace" because of careless words, right? You pretended to be crazy and talked nonsense. The country was originally "as secure as a rock," but after your actions, which seemed to be spreading rumors and organizing conspiracies, wasn't the country ruined by you?</p>
<p>Furthermore, rulers throughout history have always been protective of their shortcomings and pleased by flattery. Even ordinary people are like this. If you can engage in idle talk, and your idle talk can become a common practice, then such a person must not be ordinary. The country will always be able to use someone like you. You must gloss over the faults of the court, or at least sit and eat your salary, remaining silent and taciturn, so that he can feel at ease with you. If you deliberately want to express "high-flying and far-reaching," "preserving your own purity," then you are satirizing the monarch in your actions, which is tantamount to considering yourself "pure" and him "turbid." Just this alone has planted the seeds of sin, let alone engaging in pure discussion? Because "I am the state," anything detrimental to the emperor is considered ruining the country, and therefore the crime is unforgivable.</p>
<p>However, a person who likes to talk, and since he is human, how can he not "talk"? Farmers can talk about the weather, droughts and floods, rice, sorghum, and millet. Merchants can talk about business, whether buying and selling is good, and whether a certain business is good to do. So what do scholars and literati talk about? Poetry and lyrics are naturally one of the topics they talk about, but just talking about this is still idle talk, isn't it? Moreover, scholars throughout history have all spoken of "serving in the government after excelling in learning," so after studying well, they will naturally talk about serving in the government, and therefore also talk about national affairs. In the active sense, it is expressed as pure discussion, and in the passive sense, it is expressed as idle talk. In short, it's just talking after all. Scholars always have to talk. Although such talk cannot be said to save the country, in reality, how can it be enough to ruin the country?</p>
<p>In reality, regardless of whether idle talk ruins the country or not, once there is idle talk within a country, and idle talk becomes a common practice, becoming fashionable for a time, then the country always feels a bit uneasy, and the country always feels a bit ruined, ruined by figures like Wu Sangui. Therefore, some people may only see the phenomenon and not see the essence, and insist on reversing cause and effect, stubbornly saying "idle talk ruins the country," without asking whether the country was ruined first and then there was idle talk, or whether the country was ruined after there was idle talk.</p>
<p>If idle talk is sure to ruin the country, then wouldn't many street rumors also ruin the country? Aren't those who sit in teahouses drinking tea all day also people who ruin the country? Do we have to remain silent after tea and wine? From this, we can understand that idle talk still has a scope, and the words spoken in idle talk also have a certain content. It takes certain idle talk to avoid the qualification of ruining the country, that is, "don't talk about national affairs, only talk about the wind, flowers, snow, and moon."</p>
<p>Now is also an era when idle talk is popular, but the techniques of idle talk are more advanced than before. Perhaps this is a collection of the great achievements of idle talk from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign? But at this time, idle talk will definitely not have the suspicion of ruining the country, and it can't be said to have the qualification of ruining the country either. Street rumors and boasting after tea and wine go without saying, while the literati of the present time rack their brains to come up with many methods of idle talk. After meeting, in addition to things like "the weather today... ha ha ha," there are movie stars, dancing stars, box murder cases, etc. to talk about, without having to involve national affairs. As for writers who are not content with silence, they can also compile small literary magazines like Analects, Lost Classics, and Cosmic Wind to write some humorous articles, which is also equivalent to engaging in idle talk. This will definitely not ruin the country, and there is no fear that the whole world will be a family of idle talkers. At the same time, precisely because these idle talks are not idle talks that ruin the country, then the country will not be ruined.</p>
<p>But what is worrying is that if the country is ever ruined—although not due to idle talk—when it is ruined by figures like Yin Rugeng, then how will these non-ruining idle talkers save the already ruined country?</p>
