<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯非常大會的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>國聯非常大會已於前天開幕了這次特別大會的召開是由於阿根廷的提議據該國政府向國聯秘書長所提出的照會這次特別大會的主耍任務是討論下列三個問題　對意制裁問題　宣佈不承認意國吞併阿比西尼亞　修改國聯盟約茲就各國最近的態度來一論這次國聯非常大會的前途</p>
<p>先就對意制裁問題說這次大會之將通過撤銷的建議那是沒有絲毫疑問的自從去年十月意大利發動東非的侵略戰爭後英國因為本身的利害關係就在日內瓦首先發動對意的經濟制裁而自意國宣佈吞併阿國後英國就準備撤銷對意經濟制裁因為在保守黨政府看來制裁的繼續施行非但不能使墨索里尼吐出已經吞入肚中的肥肉讓它分嘗一臠而且還更將激起意國對英的惡感妨害其在地中海上以及近東一帶的旣得利益因此保守黨政府經過多次的考慮就於六月十七日的閣議上决定撤銷對意經濟制裁並由外相艾登在議會巾演說撤銷的三大理由我們且不去論英國撤銷對意制裁的理由實為一種外交上的掩飾詞令但其將在日內瓦决定擁護或發動撤銷制裁的建議却是沒有疑問的在英國政府决定撤銷對意制裁後法國人民內閣也就繼之决定贊成英國的態度依照法國人民陣錢的政綱說法國政府是不應採取這種態度的但就目前意德二國之企圖結成侵略集團的形勢說法國就不能不權衡利害而步英國的後塵了除了英法外波蘭也於上月底首先實行徹銷對意制裁其他各國的態度雖還沒有明顯的表示但反對撤銷制裁的恐怕很少所以就各國的態度觀察國聯非常大會之通過撤銷制裁問題是沒有疑義的</p>
<p>國聯的撤銷對意制裁當然是對其本身的一大打擊為保全其一部的面子起見國聯對於意大利以武力所造成的事實——呑併阿比西尼亞當不會予以承認在阿根廷致國聯秘書處的照會中就表明其不能承認意國併阿的合法原來不承認以武力獲得領土的合法是阿根廷政府的一貫外交政策在其所提議之南美不侵略與和解公約中就有明顯的規定其他各會員國也必擁護這種主張</p>
<p>至於修改盟約實是國聯對意制裁失敗後的必然結果這次大會中雖列有這個議案但未必就能討論得一個結果現在的重要問題是怎樣修改盟約各國關於盟約的修改已經有許多非正式的建議英國是想縮小國聯的權力使成為區域協定的形式法國則主張盟約不必修正僅在十六條中加入註釋就够所加註釋為凡有直接利害關係的隣近各國當對侵略者實施軍事制裁至其他各會員國則僅施以經濟制裁英國的建議是將整個的國際和平分裂開來而祗謀其局部的安全這種建議如被通過則國聯的壽命也將就此完結而法國的建議則反是如龍獲得通過則國聯的權力必較以前更形增大對於和平的維持也將有更大的貢獻現在英法的不同態度經過勃倫與艾登在日內瓦一度密談據云已經獲得妥協是則國聯的前途似還有一錢的光明但國際和平的眞正力量還是建築於全世界大多數民衆的熱烈擁護上這是我們應該認淸的宋令陳速謀解决辦法</p>
<h3>陳覺生訪今井　續商豐台事件　宋令陳速謀解决辦法　日對所提條件允讓步</h3>

<h3>記禹貢學會　（北平特信）</h3>
<p>近來常在日本刋物上、看到關於禹貢學會的消息、與夫討論其研究成績的文章、而在中國刊物上、除去今年正月東方雜誌三十三卷第一號、容庚氏那篇記考古學社的文章裹、曾附帶提到幾句外、其餘則不多見、吾國人對自己知道的尙不及日本人之詳盡與淸楚、於此亦可得一例證、夫以該會抱負之遠大、研究之深刻、與夫其在今日我國學術界活動範圍之廣闊、國人實不能不對之寄一莫大之企望、而予以莫大之注意也、記者用特盡力向各方搜求該會之情形、略約記出、以吿國人、際此故都幾將陷於淪亡、吾人耳目所及者、均屬慘淡現象之今日、或亦可略予國人以少許之興奮、而略袪絕望、但傷與束手待斃之感、</p>
<p>（一）研究工作</p>
<p>該會於前年國難嚴重時產生、二年餘來、又悉在國難之日益嚴重裹掙扎、如再追溯根源、卽該會之產生由來、亦未嘗非由於受國難嚴重之刺激所致、故該會之最大目標、厥為從學術界之立塲、致力於救國工作、斯卽該會於募集基金啟內、創立宗旨一項中、所說「救國之道、千端萬緒、面致力於地理、由認識國家民族之內涵、進而謀改造之方術、以求與他國方駕馳騁於世界、固其主要之一端也、」</p>
<p>在救國之目標下、該會所採之手段、雖為研究地理、但其研究方法、與一般就地理而研究地理者、又復不同、其所用方法、一言以蔽之、可名為綜合的方法、如再析而言之、則（一）在橫的方面、舉凡民族·交通·文化·政治·經濟·等種種現象無不包括在內、（二）在縱的方面、遠溯往古、近迄現代、一切演變·遷移·混合·分化·等種種沿革、均在研究對象之中、斯亦卽該會募集基金啟內所說、「目的在研治沿革地理、並進而任實地調查之工作、以識吾中華民族自分歧而至混一之跡象、以識吾中華民族開闢東亞大地而支配之方術、以識吾中華民族艱難奮鬥以保存共種姓之精神、薪為吾民族主義奠定堅實之基礎、且薪為吾全國人民發生融合統一之力量、此今日之大任、非敢以能力薄弱自諉者也、」更顯明言之、卽該會之研究地理、並非就單純之大地、加以研究、而其最主要著力點、厥在視此大地為民族種種活動之舞臺、而始加以研究、吾人試一究該會研究計劃之八大綱領、則其意義當更可明瞭、斯所謂八大綱領者卽、（一）編輯中國民族史、（二）編輯中國地理沿革史、（三）編輯中國地理沿革圖、（四）考訂校補歷代正史地理志、（五）編纂中國地理書目、（六）編輯中國地名辭典、（七）錄輯中國地方文化史料集、（八）編輯中華民國一統志、</p>
<p>該會自二十三年二月在北平成立以來、至現在為北、其研究工作之進行、共有下面幾種、</p>
<p>第一為發刋禹貢半月刊、該刋年出二十四本、而以每十二期為一卷、故現已出至五卷八期、裝訂方面、每期原為三十頁、自四卷起已大加擴充、每期達八九十頁之多、封面亦改用厚道林紙、彩色字排印（甚覺大方樸素、其編排方法、每期共有三欄、一欄為論文、一欄為國內地理界消息、另一欄則為通訊一束、此三欄中國內理界消息、則專輯國內關於地理方面有價値之統計與記載通內關於地理方面有事此方面研究者之意見與近况、而最主要之一欄、仍屬第一欄、此欄每期載論文十篇左右、悉為精萃之作、至第三卷為止、據統計三十六期中、共載有論文二百四十二篇、其中關於古代地理者七十七篇、戰國至漢二十七篇、三國至唐者二十篇、宋至元九篇、明至淸者二十三篇、關於邊疆者二十四篇，內地種族者五篇、中外交通者十三篇、方志研究者、十一篇、地方小記者七篇、地圖評論者十二篇、遊記者九篇、書評·目錄·傳記共二十四篇、通論雜類等共十篇、第四卷及第五卷之一共十八期內所刋者、尙不在內、論該刋在國內地理學刋物方面之地位、實可謂數一數二、</p>
<p>該會已進行而有成績之第二工作、則為晝圖工作、關於此方面、從民國二十二年起到現在、已進行有四五年之久、其所晝之圖、大概可分為兩種、一為現代圖、一為沿革圖、此二種中、除沿革圖已成四十餘張外、關於現代圖、亦已完成五分之四、共用去經費四千之鉅、尙需經費一千元、卽可竣工、此筆欵項、亦悉由顧頡剛·鄭德坤二氏私人籌措、此外並由洪煨蓮氏輯印利瑪　地圖專號、現已出版多日、洋洋大觀、實地學界本年之盛事也、</p>
<p>除上述二項工作外、此外為該會所亟擬進行者、尙有下列三事（一）印行專書、此種工作意義、在於發刊學者專門研究之成績、現在該會已積有成稿十餘種、悉為精心結構之作、如王日蔚之中國回族史、馮家昇之東北史地、西遼史、譚其驤之中國內地移民史、等等、惟估計印費、如每月平均出一二種、則一年內非需六千元莫辦、如此鉅數、一時籌措無從、致佳作不能及早問世、言之可惜、（二）舉行集團研究工作、聘定專人、分工研究、編印目片、俾後之研究者、可省去無限光陰與精力、（三）商定專題、每年組織旅行團一次或二次、作實地調查、考察之工作、（本年暑假、據聞已擬舉辦此種旅行團、前赴五原、包頭等處、作考察溝渠之工作、而前領導河套開發工作達六十年之王同春氏公子王樂愚君、亦已函請該會前往、並願為嚮導矣、）惟舉行第（二）項工作、每年估計約需經費六千元、舉行第（三）項工作、則又需經費五千元、暫時經費方面有無辦法、尙未可知、</p>
<p>（二）當前計畫</p>
<p>該會當前計畫之最大者、厥為研究邊疆、關於此點、該會已擬有詳細之計畫書、其在工作進行方面、大概分為三點、（一）搜集材料與提出問題、（二）訓練調查人才、（三）獎勵邊疆研究、據悉該會已將全國邊疆應加研究之問題、分成十一主題、計卽（一）滿州、（二）蒙古、（三）新疆、（四）靑海、（五）西藏、（六）西南諸族、（七）南洋、（八）海防、（九）沿長城附近、（十）屯田、（十一）移民、每一主題、均由該會從會員中之學有專精者、提出名單三五人不等、計十一主題、共提出名單三十九人、以供政府開發邊疆及各方有志開發邊疆者之參考、</p>
<p>此項研究邊疆計書、所需經費、據聞第一年估計約需三萬三千三百四十元正、至於如何籌措、情形尙不能詳、</p>
<p>該會當前之第二計畫、厥為募集基金、據說擬在十年之內、募集三十萬元、如機會順利、並擬縮短年限、現擬由會員中選舉八人、及贊助會員七人為委員、組織「禹貢學會籌募基金委員會」、負責管理募捐及支付事宜、</p>
<p>所得捐欵、除以十分之一購買圖書外、其餘則盡歸基金項下存儲、如捐欵人指定用途、不併入基金者亦可、凡捐欵在五十元或代募五百元以上者、均由該會敦請為贊助會員、並刻鏤金石以為紀念、據聞自開始募集以來，除張國淦氏慨捐私產北平小紅羅廠房產一座、共大五畝、有房二十間外、其餘普通應募者、亦甚為湧躍、國人近年來漸覺高深專門研究之可貴、亦於茲可見、此外並聞將有幾筆特別捐欵、惟前途究竟可否順利、現尙不得而知、</p>
<p>總之該會於國難如此嚴重中出現、抱負如此之宏遠、而網羅各方面人材、又如此之多、吾人對其前途、實覺有無限之關心、而寄以莫大之希冀、　者希臘大科學亞奇米德（Archimedes）於羅馬人破城侵入其住宅、舉刃相逼時、尙能鎭定如常、叱亂兵勿毀其作學理試騐之沙盤、世人或有笑其愚者、但亞氏前此因已用其研究所得大敗羅馬人之圍攻於前矣、所借者、一人之力、難以支撑全局而已、但亞氏之精神、實令人拜服、吾人處國家如此風雨飄搖之時、對禹貢學會之出現、可作如是觀、但望該會能以集團力量於救國工作中、竭共最大之努力、</p>

<p>電報局對廣播電台　取締無益節目</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>增加稽查員積極管理</p>
<p>交通部上海電報局、自受命管理廣播電台以來、辦理不遺餘力、舉凡整理電波周率、審查唱詞劇本、調查電台報告人員、無不積極從事、茲該局從昨日起、對於上海民營廣播電台節目、又有更具體之規定、詳情探誌如下、</p>
<p>腳本審查　進來電台播音、多誨淫句、靡靡之音、有碍市民正常之習慣、該局有鑒於此、爰審查腳本、統治播音、自審查以來、至今年五月底、審查腳本、有一千餘部、雖經上海廣播業同業公會請延期、但至六月底、已告一度段落、審查結果、對於不合格之腳本、槪予相當限制及取締、</p>
<p>取締節目、該局對於取締節目、定有相當標準、卽（一）宗旨純正、（二）不危害治安、（三）要適合黨議原則、（四）不可誨淫、（五）不含有神怪妖異、（六）不違背科學原理、（七）不違背論理精神、（八）不可有污穢俚俗、（九）不得播揚封建思想、以上九項、爲該局擬以改良社會習慣、促進社會教育、增加科學智能之基礎、倘有故犯、卽加以取締、聞四明文戲、（卽寗波灘簧）已絕對禁止播送、</p>
<p>時間限制　此次審查結果、認爲不合格者頗多、但該局擇情節較輕者、予以時間上之限制、亦爲改進廣播事業中之必要步驟、計被限制者、有申曲·滑稽蘇灘·四明文書·四明南詞·小曲·清曲·淮戲·各派宣卷、以上各節目、包括唱片在內、各電台每天播送、不得超過三小時、而每天下午七時半至十時之間、爲市民公餘之暇、均不得在此事件內傳播、</p>
<p>增加人員　該局審查腳本、以腳本與唱詞之間、仍有出入、故腳本雖經審查、播音者是否言行一致、却成問題、因此局方位正本清源計、特設電台廣播稽查員、每日諦聽各電台所播節目、遇有可疑者、隨卽加制止、但稽查員工作範圍廣大、有窘於應付之勢、故局方進來增加稽查員名額、以應工作之需要、</p>
<p>出借唱片　前面所述、皆是消極方面之防止、積極方面、亦在準備、初由中央廣播事業管理處發行廣播週刋、選擇戲劇故事八十餘篇外、該局爲提高民族思想、特又收買大批黨歌、及名人演講之灌音片、將來義務出街與各電台播送、不取費用、籍資充實廣播內容、</p>
<p>辦理登記　播音台之報告員、向無統計、其籍貫年歲履歷、更無從知悉、今局方正着手調查、以作將來登記之準備、蓋報告員之身份與業務、關係電台事業非少、故亦從而整理之、聞已調查至六七百人之多、一俟調查手續完竣、卽行辦理登記、</p>

<h3>上海之南貨業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之三十）</p>
<p>七，市價　南北貨市價，種類繁多，難以詳述，凡各地同一之產品，市價顯有高低，盡其品質有優劣之分。面積分市價之漲落，除上述之判別外，又須視產地之豐歉，以及市場銷路暢狹為轉移也。惟該業之市價。自有業以來逐見上升。鮮有下跌。形成近年來突進有之高價。考其主因。一以社會生活程序增高，需要頻繁。及關稅增加。二以天災人祝，交相煎逼。人民未能安居樂業，生產銳減。兼有仰給於外貨所致耳。至該業向市場辦貨。有南規與北規之分，南規者，行家售與客家。北規者號家開給行家。例如瓜子一包。號家開撥行家按市秤八三折計算外。每包再除皮二斤，價售十四元。南規者行家售與客家瓜子一包。按市秤八八折計算。包皮不扣。計多七斤。合算值洋一元。卽為行貼。價售十五元。行家售盤。略有參差。如市情俏俐。照開照賣。萬一開進之後。連日轉疲。行家貼佣出售。（卽除去行貼一元）惟北規須銀貨兩繳。南規則前欵二月外。續放十五天。因此各有劃算。故內地商號。資金充厚者。大都向號家直接採辦云。</p>

<p>康健之路</p>
<h3>近世治淋藥之新發見</h3>
<p>花柳病為亡國病，亦為文明病，是以患之者日衆，而關於是項治淋之藥，亦層出不窮，而語其實效，則多未能達圓滿無缺之境，蓋殺菌力强，則損害健康之部位；且對於胃腸及腎臟等器官、受害亦烈，往往於服後未幾，卽有嘔吐頭暈等不良刺戟，因而體內之抗毒力减少，反予淋菌以繁殖之機會。故淋病反而增劇，若無殺菌效力，則服此項藥品，與不服者等，因此淋病無藥醫之呼聲，到處可見。</p>
<p>夫以今日科學之進步，淋病豈眞無藥醫哉，據現在世界各大著各醫學博士之報台，以羅彼得氏之「克淋儂」藥，堪稱傑出之治淋新藥，因此藥之原料，係用無毒性之殺菌藥，何謂無毒性之殺菌劑，卽將藥之副作用完全提凈，而存純粹之殺菌作用，且於服「克淋儂」後，不僅局部殺菌，卽全身內部，亦發生抗毒素，而阻遏淋菌之蔓延流竄各處。此則尤為世界治淋藥中之特出也。凡淋病中之攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，前後尿道炎等，併發症續發症等，服後莫不於數星期內，收消炎鎭痛，殺菌淸濁之功，惟在購買「克淋儂」時，務須認定「克淋儂」三字，勿為旁人之言所惑，致誤購劣藥，反使增病，其時悔之晚矣。</p>
<h3>腸胃病之連帶關係</h3>
<p>胃臟司飲食之攝取，蓋為一貯藏食物之袋，在經過相當消化後，送入腸中，以行其消化之實，然後乃得吸收，此其大略也，欲詳論非短紙所能盡，惟讀者明此卽悟。食物貴於細咀，否則過於堅硬，或汚穢不潔，或過熱過凉，腐敗發酵，食後卽致損傷胃機能，而使胃粘膜受其刺激，致引起反胃嘔吐，食慾呆頓等症，同時，因胃部之食物不消化，至腸中後，則腸之蠕云亦失常度，而有洩下痢疾等病。此腸胃病關係之梗槪也。</p>
<p>在夏令每易發生上項之賜胃病，於其初發時，最好服以防腐及糾正腸蠕動之製劇，切不可妄事止嘔止瀉，以使病菌滋生於內，此實要義，惜外間雖有許多胃劑，而確有洽療腸疾患者，則又無之，蓋二可得而兼，獨「强胃精」一藥，旣具「强胃」之功，復具淸腸之績，故胃病無論新久，噯氣頻頻，胸部悶脹，食後作痛，不思飲食，腸疾患之瀉痢，腸鳴便　，瓦斯多而時洩空屁，大便秘結等，均有根本治愈之藥力，以其內含蛋黃素及補血補腦諸名貴成分，故久病不復元，老年與煙民便秘及斷癮，皆有良效，一經進服，數星期內，自然逐步痊愈，終至斷根不發，又以其內含維他命A．B．D．三種重要補分，故除善治因缺乏維他命B．而來之脚氣症外，尤有健身偉力也。</p>
<h3>發育不全與畸形發育</h3>
<p>發育不全者，謂身體各部發育，不能達到成年人之程度也，畸形發育者，謂發育不能如成人之正常也。考其原因，多為內分泌機能失常所致。此等病的發育不全現象，在人之下部更形顯，如年齡已達成人，但下部矮小，猶依然小童，或雖發育則呈弓形屈曲之狀，但後者不多見，而前者如素耽手淫，或早婚房事過度之人，往往遇之，對於子嗣前途，旣有絕大障害，而於兩性幸福方面，更不堪設想，凡夙有是患者，宜及早求治，以免病蒂更深也。</p>
<p>關於此項症狀之原因，旣由於內分泌機能之失常，故宜用臟器療法以治之。顧此等荷爾蒙製劑，因選擇材料與配製方法關係，每為之失去固有效用，惟內分泌學家梅倫氏所發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」二藥，功效甚為卓特，其原料乃取靑春期之牝牡動物，以科學方法，提出睪丸及卵巢之荷爾蒙所製成，價值高貴，違非一般低廉之品可比。服後能於三數星期內，徹底將生殖系組織改造。凡男性發育不全，遺精，早洩，下體勃起力不全，及女性月經困難，經期紊亂，乳臀諸部，皆平坦而欠發育，及兩性之久婚不孕，頭痛失眠，心悸亢進，精神抑鬱，興味索然，記憶力减退，腰酸脚弱等，服之均可治愈，且能使肌肉充實細膩，面色紅潤退除皺皮白髮等。故歐美各大醫家，亦久已採用也。</p>
<h3>婦女之暗疾</h3>
<p>所謂暗疾，在男子有時或不以為然，但在女子，因天性怕羞，所以雖以我人視為平常之疾，婦女總是含羞不語。如婦女中最所經見之白帶病，在醫學上本極平淡無奇，而彼亦恒不告人，因此反而將白帶病增重，如膣道浸潤糜爛，小腹膨脹，月經不調，終日惡液奔流不絕，而招外來之細菌，致驟變巨患，是不可不打破舊觀念，而早日醫治也。</p>
<p>關於白帶之療法，固亦多矣，然其間最為醫家所樂用者，第一當推「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，此藥對於殺菌及制止局部分泌液之作用甚大，如每現用此片放人膣道深部，能於最短期間，滌凈白帶，乾潔如處女。惟如因淋病而來者，可同時內服「克淋儂」，因身體衰弱而來者，可服「補女容」，依此方法醫治，不僅治愈，且可斷根。此「陰道片」在我國近亦盛為風行，良以其功效正確故也。</p>
<h3>治愈淋病之惟一路徑</h3>
<p>淋病雖自古目為難治之病，而實則治淋之藥，較任何製劑為多，此正因淋病無特效藥，於是淋藥乃如雨後春筍，相繼產生也。但夷考其實，殊鮮美效，蓋其中多係雜有事澄茄，檀香油等品，多服足碍胃腸之機能，及堵塞腎臟。反引起小便滯澀，發生自家中毒，危及生命。至所謂透膜殺菌，亦僅局所治療，若用於急性尿道炎，尙或有效，苟施諸慢性淋，及合併症，則無益於事，蓋此為淋毒侵及全身之徵，非局部可以　事耳。</p>
<p>據各國醫學界最新之治淋見解，在急性時惟適用闥　療法Schwellenreiztherapie，可獲增進細胞之防病機能，慢性則宜施以特殊療法Specifische　Behandjung品但此種方法，以前尙係注射用之，因注射種種手續不便，學者乃精益求精，改為內服藥，遂成為今日傳遍世界之「克淋儂」，極便於病家自療，其對於男女一切急慢性淋濁治療，雅有卓騐，男子之急性龜頭炎，慢性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，女子急性陰門淋，及膣道淋，慢性子宮淋等，本藥皆有根治功能，可獲徹底全愈。據歐洲著名醫院統計，男子服「克淋儂」而獲全治者，竟於百人中有九十二名，女子因較遵守攝生，戒絕房事，目同時外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，故收效尤在男子之上，實萬全之製劑也。則其傳播全球，亦必然之事耳、</p>
<h3>何法根治遺精</h3>
<p>夫遺精一病，世之患者極多，大都於少壯之年，受性的刺激，誤犯手淫，致性神經衰弱而起，故患本病者，輒有眩暈頭痛，心悸健忘，判斷方銳减等，患此者每陷於悲觀苦悶，因而厭世者有之。</p>
<p>本病之藥劑，並非罕見，惟因或失之過峻，或失之太鈍，過峻之藥，徒事堵塞精道，副作用甚大，用之反使性慾興奮，太鈍者則有服藥之名而無服藥之實，特耐氏「育精片」一藥，在近日普偏流行，馳譽寰宇，蓋能調整性組織，使遺精不論每週之次數多少，大小便或用力時滑精，白日漏精等，槪歸全治。其因遺精誘發之神經衰弱，眩暈苦悶等，皆獲消失，又本劑能增强意志，故可戒絕手淫，實根本解决遺精之藥也。按「育精片」一藥，中西及天和藥房有售。</p>
<h3>肺癆診斷及治療感冒宜注意</h3>
<p>肺結核發病，多取慢性經地。故第一第二期，大半不知不識經過，但最初期之症狀，卽為感冒，如感冒咳嗽至二三星期之久，卽傾向於肺癆，故治愈初期之感冒，實極緊要，肺癆旣巳形成，則全身衰弱，責血，食慾不振，且起惡心嘔吐下痢等，體重日减，有時胸間刺痛，突然喀血，漸漸發生高熱。至此則已轉入第三期矣，</p>
<p>以上為肺癆之診斷，對於其療法，惟應增進榮養，並促生肺中之鈣質，一方藥治須服以减酸性之劑，而使癆菌脫臘，則癆症不難根除矣。</p>
<p>查　質　　　　癆菌，榮養　　即可亢加全身之抵抗力。若癆菌脫去臘質，則抗力銳减，而束手就擒。「補肺拿爾」一藥，係經徒梅博士，用各種珍貴之化學劑，提製而成，故效騐昭著，而神力特雄。但又無過熱燥烈之弊，宜於夏令進服，無魚肝油之膩滯，而有榮養之効。善治肺癆各期症候，如喀血咳嗽，咯痰氣急胸痛潮熱，盜汗身衰，皆擅殊功。又以其能除氣管之炎性分泌，故久咳頑痰，老年哮喘，傷風，百日咳，服此允有良效，若肺癆而兼有神經衰弱，在男子可同時並服「補體康」，以治遺精腎萎，壯健其神經，婦女倘兼有月經不調等虛症，可同時並服「補女客」以調經補血，旺盛體力，則其他所患失眠心悸等症，一掃而除，躋于仁壽之域，蓋可斷言矣。</p>

<p>診址四川路寗波路口，診時下午四時至六時</p>
<h3>「克淋儂」治騐一束</h3>
<p>全身淋病</p>
<p>患者周久之君，因患淋病，旣失根治之機緣，復因性好運動，突變為全身麻痺，骨節疼痛，不能轉側，困苦萬分，而小便亦復艱　異常，尿後繼之以血，症狀十萬險惡，諸藥嘗試殆遍，而功效全無，此乃淋毒性全身傳染也。乃由戴德醫師介紹，服「克淋儂」，前後服至五六星期左右，始將淋菌全部肅淸，</p>
<p>紅腫作痛</p>
<p>患者朱君綬君，偶於酒後，涉足花叢，歸卽毒發，初則尿道如蟻走虫行，痛癢交作，繼則尿道灼熱，痛如針刺，尿意頻數，龜頭紅腫，又因泌出茶綠色膿液甚多，致包皮內亦受此等毒素之刺戟，因而包皮亦腫大翻轉，十分痛楚，臥不安枕，食而無味，因秘不使人得知，暗服雜牌成藥，迄未有效，反而痛楚增甚，後由鄧源和醫師介給，服用『克淋儂』，服未數星期，卽告炎消痛去，腫退尿淸，遂獲根治。</p>
<p>一再重發</p>
<p>患者林一諤君，前罹淋毒性膀胱炎，小腹疝痛，尿中沈澱物甚多，曾以此等尿液送往專家檢查，內有淋菌甚多，幸由姚菊嚴醫師介紹，服『克淋儂』而愈。林君因不注意此毒曾傳染其夫人，今林君之淋病雖愈，而其夫人之白帶未痊，因此重新傳染，以致舊病又發，仍往購服『克淋儂』，幸於數星期中治愈，至此林君始知其重發之原因。在於其夫人之白帶，乃為之購服『克淋儂』，及外用『卡而雪地氏陰道片』，於最短期內，將白帶滌除，淋毒根治，林君與其夫人偕居數年，愛情彌篤，迄未重發云。</p>
<p>體弱淋纏</p>
<p>患者唐聲海君，體本弱，兼為淋毒所纏，荏苒三載，迄未就痊，而病益深，體益弱，尿意不暢，遇勞而有淋系浮現於尿面，而昔日之遺精早洩症，亦更加劇，迭經醫治，未獲寸效，嗣幸由陳少華醫師介紹，以『克淋儂』及『補體康』同時服用，果獲奇效，小便頓覺爽利，遺精等患，亦去六七，乃繼服不輟，非特淋病全愈，卽孱弱之身軀，亦雄壯異常，作事虎虎有力，前後判若兩人，因此唐君到處譽揚『克淋儂』及『補體康』二樂功效之偉大云。</p>

<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角診時：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>淋毒性關節炎。</p>
<p>淋毒性關節炎，為淋毒患者，延宕失治之結果，本來淋病未至全身傳染時，毒菌多塵集生殖器部份，及因飲酒房事等刺戟，淋菌由血液侵入關節，因而發炎化膿，遂成是症。患者，呈倦怠，頭痛，食慾不振等之全身症狀，體溫升騰，恒在四十度以上，關節疼痛，不能轉側，如不急事治療，則關節紅腫化膿，有時變成敗血症。致有生命之危險。</p>
<p>此項症狀之治療，苟能與以適當之方法，根治並非難事，據余歷年來醫治之經騐，恒用抗淋血淸，行靜脈注射，及輔以X線及電療以扑滅廣泛之淋菌，同時更進服消炎鎭痛之克淋特效藥，以淸血液中之淋毒，如此內外兼治，則收效尤著，恒能於最短期間，將淋菌全部肅淸。且愈後雖行種種刺戟，亦永不再發。惟已結婚者，須注意妻子之淋毒性白帶，蓋女子患此種白帶，下部糜爛，妨害小便，月經不調，小腹刺痛，亦宜內服克淋聖藥，外用陰道片為坐藥，亦怛於數星期內治愈之，愈後可不再發也。</p>

<h3>呂尙義父女破賊</h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>淸朝康熙年間，江西大庾縣有一個百姓，名字呌呂尙義，祖居南源山，夫妻倆都打得一手好鳥槍。</p>
<p>南源山在大庚崇義兩縣交界的地方，土地很肥美。但是因山高林深，正是强盜藏身的好地方，所以一些亡命之徒都在南源山裏來安營紮寨，時常到四周圍的村莊裏去騷擾搶刦，弄得附近的人家都不敢在那裹住，通通搬走了。</p>
<p>但是呂尙義却在南源山脚下住了幾十年，鄰居們都搬走了，他老不搬，山裏的强盜也奈何他們不得；因為他夫妻倆打得一手好鳥槍。鳥槍這個像伙，當然比刀槍來得利害。每逢山裹的强盜來攻打呂尙義的時候，他夫妻倆的兩支鳥槍就連環不斷的打出去，又打得準，强盜們那裏抵得住。所以每年死在呂尙義夫妻倆鳥槍下的强盜不知有多少；强盜們把他莫奈何。但是也把他恨入骨髓。</p>
<p>康熙四十年，廣東万猴山的强盜藍大王，帶了二百多個嘍囉，一個個精神飽滿，如狼似虎，刀槍似電，戈矛如林，浩浩蕩蕩穿過大庾嶺，口口聲聲說要殺到南源山去，活捉呂尙義，碎屍萬段，替若干年來被呂尙義殺死的弟兄們報仇雪恨。</p>
<p>那時南安駐得有一員參將、也帶了一營兵。但是這些兵只會平時狐假虎威、欺壓良善，對於大强盜，壓根兒不致哼半個「不」字；那時看見藍大王道樣聲勢，更要學縮頭烏龜，把腦袋往八卦甲裏一縮，任你打死他也不探出來了。那位參將看見情形不對，不敢隱瞞，趕緊報了上去。總鎭楊鈞差了文書，忍不住心頭火發，把參將痛駡了一頓，就傳令呌兩員守備，點五百精兵，火速到南源山去剿捕。</p>
<p>兩員守備領命，不敢怠慢，就下較塲點了五百精兵，頂盔貫甲，浩浩蕩蕩，星夜向南源山而去。</p>
<p>藍大王來報仇的時候，呂尙義的妻子已經死了，只剩下一個女兒，父女倆孤孤淒淒的住在南源山脚底下。呂尙義因為沒有兒子，就把這個女兒當兒子看待，敎她打鳥槍，；這女兒聰明得很，雖然才十來歲，已經打得一手好鳥槍了。</p>
<p>呂尙義自己知道同强盜結下大仇，强盜一時雖然不敢來惹自己，但是終歸是要來報仇的；所以時時刻刻都在防着。</p>
<p>藍大王這次來，一過大庾嶺，就口口聲聲說要找呂尙義報仇，不等他到南源山，呂尙義早就知道，一面更加小心的提防，一面又吿訴女兒知道，說：「有賊人來找我報仇。你不要怕，隨着我，我們的鳥槍打得好，管敎他們有去無回。」</p>
<p>一天，天色剛明，呂尙義已經起來了，憑他那對訓練過的耳朶，聽見遠遠有許多脚步聲，這是南源山很少有的事，他就知道是報仇的來了。</p>
<p>呂尙義是久經大敵的人，心裏很鎭靜，一點也不慌亂，過去把他的女兒搖醒，小聲的說：「女兒，起來，賊人來了。」</p>
<p>那女兒一翻身爬了起來，起初還有些慌張，過後一看見呂尙義那樣不慌不忙的樣兒，也不知不覺的鎭靜了，一聲兒不言語，慢慢的結束好；呂尙義就遞過一支鳥槍來。</p>
<p>呂尙義同他的女兒一人拿着一支鳥槍，伏在早巳砌好的槍眼面前，把彈藥擺在兩人的中問。呂尙義的屋下是修在山崖裏，只一面是敝的，槍眼就砌在這面。這時，藍大王同他帶來的二百多嘍囉已經可以隱隱的的的看見了。</p>
<p>呂尙義又囑咐他女兒說：「不要慌，要搖準了才放槍，我們要一顆彈丸取一個賊人的性命。幷且我們不要一齊放搶，要一個援一個放，才有裝彈藥的時候，彈丸也才不會斷。」</p>
<p>藍大王的嘍囉走至隔得屋子不遠的地方，就吶一聲喊，向呂尙義的尾子撲來。這裏呂尙義父女看得親切，雙槍齊放，在烟霧裹，前排的嘍囉早已經全了幾個。但是這些嘍囉們是不怕死的、仍然呐着喊，朝前撲，呂尙義父女的槍也是連環不斷向放出去，彈丸如雨，打得灰塵滿天，聲如雷鳴。相持了一個多時候，藍天王的嘍囉已經死了五十幾個，帶傷的也不少，藍大王自己也帶了傷，支持不住，就敗了下去。</p>
<p>呂尙義看見强盜敗走了，仍然兩眼注視着，直到看不見了，才把鳥槍放下，吐了一口長氣；他女兒也把鳥槍放下了。</p>
<p>等到那兩員守備，帶領五百精兵走攏南潭山的時候，藍大王已經被呂尙義打敗了。但是這些强盜還沒有走，全藏在南源山裏。南源山裏路徑很雜，樹林又多，這一處，那一處，官兵不敢進去搜山，大家都說：「賊人在暗處，我們在明處，如果進去，準吃虧。」</p>
<p>呂尙義看不過，就去向兩員守備說：「不要緊的。我的路熟，隨我來，一定可以捉到賊人。」</p>
<p>有呂尙義吿奮勇，兩員守備也壯了膽，就帶領五百精兵，跟着呂尙義進山。進山不遠，呂尙義眼尖，就看見深草裏伏得有强盜，就舉起鳥種，瞄準了就放，「嗤」的一聲，就打倒了幾個，剩下的强盜都驚了，大家攀山越嶺的跑了。官兵終歸膽怯，看着强盜跑，也不敢去追，只把强盜丟下的三尊沙砲拿回去報功去了。</p>
<p>從此以後，呂尙義父女的威名就震助了大庚崇義兩縣。</p>
<p>大庚崇義兩縣的境內都是山多，很容易藏强盜，這些强盜叉大半害怕呂尙義。於是，崇義知縣高尙瑛，把呂尙義請到衙門裏去，擺上酒席，又送許多銀子，打算委呂尙義做捕快。同時大庾知縣也把呂尙義請去，也來這一套，也打算委他做捕快。兩位知縣你爭我奪，解决不了，叉動公文到南安府去爭，呂尙義眞算吃香了。</p>
<p>呂尙義却有辦法，兩縣委他都不幹，他向兩位知縣說：「小的是一個做莊稼的人，不願意當捕快。但是我住的是兩縣交界的地方、兩縣父母官要安靖地方，小的那裏敢不聽命令。不過小的不做捕快也有辦法的。南源山這一帶地方，有小的女兒，賊人就不敢來。以後雨縣境界裏裏如果有賊人，官兵要去剿捕，小的一定跟了去；小的一到，賊人自然會跑了。</p>
<p>兩位知縣聽了，都很高興，送了呂尙義許多東西，仍然讓他回南源山去。</p>
<p>廣東的强盜們聽見藍大王來栽了這樣一個大跟頭，再也不敢到南安府屬來騷擾了。</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦</h3>
<p>— Albert　Einstem　華叔倫</p>
<p>牛頓以為空間時間是絕對的，可是牛頓以後三百年，愛因斯坦否定了他，他却以為空間和時間全是相對的，沒有絕對的。費祥君編譯的通俗相對論大意（商務）上面一個淺近的倒可以引來說明：鑒如吾們說從杭州到北平，所經的時間是很長的，那末所說的長自然是比較出來的，就是說杭州到北平的時間，比杭州到上海的時間長；又如說泰山是很大，就是說泰山所占的空間，比起各處的小山來是很大的，……可見吾們測時的長短，物的大小等，原沒有絕對的標準。至於相對論的學說，非常艱深，而愛因斯坦發明的學說也不過是求得科學上的眞理而已。（雖然，眞理正是實用的基礎。）我們至此祗將愛因期坦的經歷與為人介紹一下。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦一八七九年三月十四日生於南德多腦河上河的威姆市，他是猶太種，父為商人，在他生後六週，他的父親便把闔家移居慕尼克，與他的叔叔共營當時的新興事業，電氣工塲。從小他便在一種科學的零圍中長大，可是他雖晚年成名，而對於慕尼克這個地方，却一直沒有好感，因為他小時在此入學，第一次領會一個猶太人在德國所遭受的痛苦。</p>
<p>他的數學才能，自幼便是顯著的早熟，十三歲便自習初等幾何學敎科書，對於幾何學敎科書，對於幾何學的演譯的體系美，發生很大的感銘，後來（一九三二年）他在牛津大學演講理淪物理學的方法時，曾說初讀歐幾里得的人，假使對於其構造的美無動於中的，可以說不足與語理論物理學。但後來一出中學，他對於數學的熱誠，一變而為對於物理學的熱中，物理學不但是他整個研究的目標，而且他自信在其中可得到普通的全般數學的知識。</p>
<p>十七歲他入瑞士國立基列（Zurich）理工科大學讀書，在其自雙親寄與之每月百法郎學費中，取出二十法郎，以為取得瑞士國籍之儲金，生活方面遂不得不格外節的，這樣子因為當時的營養不良，便種下了後年胃腸病的隱根。雖則如此，他在基大時，仍不時出入歌劇院，以滿足其對於音樂的愛好。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年大學卒業後，他便想求獨立生活，去當中學敎員，同時家庭方面亦渴望他有一位置，以補助家庭經濟之不足，可是瑞士中學之正敎員非有瑞士國籍不可，他那個時候還不够資格，不得不暫吿賦閑。後來得一職工學校的臨時位置，繼又應廣吿中之徵求而自薦為沙夫豪原地方的家庭敎師，不久又以東翁不喜他的自由主義思想辭職了。</p>
<p>一九〇二年因同學之父介紹，遂入瑞士首府蒲恩的專利局任技士，同時正式取得瑞士國籍。</p>
<p>他在專利局很盡職的服務，細心察看各種新發明，同時常偷暇作種種計算研究，一聽見局長的足聲，便慌忙把圓規，密達尺之類藏入八實箱的抽屜中。</p>
<p>在入專利局的前年起，他便絡續在Ann．d．Phys（德國繼續百年以上的權威學術雜誌）上發表論文，皆為熱力學，分子論及關於當時新興的統計力學的文字，其中一九〇五年五月十一日發表的一篇很引起注意，便是對於布拉文所發見的運動現象提出一種理論說明。羅怕布拉文（Robert　Brown）一八二七年在顯微鏡下發見：很小的顆粒在液體裏面不住活動，但是這種剛可以用顯微鏡看得見的小顆粒不住的活動，他不能說明，一直成為科學界一個不可解的謎。愛因斯坦的理論是：熱可以增加分子的活動。他並列出一些方程式，試由分子的活動推論出集體來。這些論文，事實上奠定了愛氏在學術界的位置。</p>
<p>同年他在專利局時，發表了他的特殊相對論（Special　theory　of　Relativity）發表以後，當時柏林的老物理學家普蘭克敎授（Prof．Plank）第一個認為其實義的重大性，立刻致書推重。</p>
<p>一九〇九年冬學期起，愛氏任母校特別講師，此時他在社會上的地位已俄然提高，而其私生活却仍是常常推着孩子的乳車在大街上幽幽閒步。這時他已有了二個孩子了。</p>
<p>愛氏繼被捷克巴拉葛大學聘去任敎，任職一年餘，至一九一二年秋再返基大任正敎授，此事居理夫人及法數學家龐高萊（Heuri　Poincare）之推薦極力。龐氏在一九一〇年秋出席柏林烏拉紐通俗科學演講塲演講新力學時，力言愛因斯坦的相對論為牛頓以來力學上之一大革命。</p>
<p>原來，牛頓的萬有引力，雖然統治了這個世界幾百年，對於水星的行動却還無法解釋，水星應依軌道繞日而行，起訖不在一處，它總是每次要多繞一些路才完成一次整的繞行。牛頓的理論雖然不能解釋這種軌外行動，愛因斯坦却差不多能很準確的解釋。</p>
<p>他在巴拉葛時卽開始其最有名的硏究，就是光前進所走的路綫問題。從前以為光不是物質的分子所組成的，所以在眞空中會沿直綫而行，不受引力的作用。而牛頓的學說却以為光綫經過與太陽相近處，便會變為曲錢，好像光是物質所組成的一樣，但是照愛因斯坦的理論，却以為這種光綫，會比牛頓的定律要彎曲兩倍。</p>
<p>這理論一發表，因為太新奇，太與舊說兩樣，自然引起了一般頑固學者們的反對，而以同時代的物理學者阿勃賴亨反對更烈。一方面，如英國靑年天文學者愛丁頓，在倫敦物理學會，以愛氏的相對論重力論作綜合的報吿，當時基大數學敎授滑爾亦出版有名的時間。空間。物質，之講義，都為讚頌與擁護愛氏之思想者。</p>
<p>科學上的眞理的確認，實騐實測是最有力的。這是倍根的名言。一九一九年五月英國皇家學曾與皇家天文學會聯合派遣觀察測當時之日食（全蝕與旣蝕）共分兩隊，一在北部巴西，一在西非洲基內灣中的白林西貝島。相對論硏究者愛丁頓加入人非一隊中，當日是晴天，寫眞中顯示了愛因斯坦理論的確實；巴西方面因有大小二望遠鏡，小的一方面亦實證了愛因斯坦的理論，就是根據這服片，經過太陽的光錢，所彎曲的度數，正是愛因斯坦所計算的。於同月年十一月六日倫敦皇家天文學會遂正式報吿卽加以承認。</p>
<p>這時候愛因斯坦正在柏林。那時他已被聘任普魯士學院正會員，同時兼柏林大學敎授。</p>
<p>當時倫敦泰晤士報第一個以科畢革命新時代的空間論，牛頓引力論之顚覆為標題，把這消息揭載出來，同時排日介紹而解釋，此新興學說，但以此學說的深奧澀，以致別人無法着手，還不得不求愛氏親自出馬。</p>
<p>愛氏嘗謂：眞眞瞭解此理論的，全世界恐不滿一打。蕭伯訥亦當面稱愛氏的天才是孤獨的。</p>
<p>一九一二年，愛因斯坦被聘至巴黎演講，那時正當大戰方休，德學者被騁至法的，愛因斯坦還係第一個，他此舉一方面旣引人起德之反感，而在法，當時還是在巴黎市上演德語便會罹危險的時候。聘請愛氏的主持者，極力聲明愛為瑞士人，以轉移法人視聽。法人對於愛的學說，起初多抱懐疑，及至一親愛的風貌談吐，誤解便一掃而空，有名的大政治家及數學力家班樂衛氏（Paul　Painleve）便是其其中之一。</p>
<p>繼又被聘至英倫，又渡重洋而至日本，作學術演講，這位謙和安詳的老畢者便這樣逐漸和世人相見。</p>
<p>他的思想，愛好和平，他以為和平為人類絕對的理想，對於政治上，亦同一主張。所以一九一四年春，大戰爆發時，他在當時周圍昂奮中，仍關在他的硏究室裏，躭於硏究工作，完成了一般相對性原理。</p>
<p>一九二九年三月為愛因斯坦五十歲誕辰，柏林市舉行着盛大的祝賀會，可是這位壽翁却偷偷的避到柏林市外小湖畔一間陋屋裹面，去營其自炊生涯。有一個機靈的美國新聞記者尋到了那裏，反而飽受了他的冷眼，討得一塲沒趣。幾天後，他回到家裏，各方面的友人，學者，學會，學校，識與不識的賀電已堆積滿桌，而其中最使他感動的，乃是一個貧困的勞働者贈的金。他說愛氏是一個善良的偉人，他把他僅有的一些儲欵，送給愛氏作紙烟之費，以表他的敬愛。愛因斯坦便在百忙中，馬上首先對他作復。這些事，很可看出他的為人，是怎樣的謙和不好虛榮。</p>
<p>對於猶太人問題，他也非常熱心，有時為救濟貧苦猶太人，嘗親自演奏其擅長之梵華鈴，募金救濟。</p>
<p>他除愛好音樂外，划艇亦為其擅長。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦先後渡美三次，都為應加省巴大威爾遜天文臺之招聘，一九三三年十月起，他被聘任為美國紐吉西州白來斯頓市的The　institute　for　advanced　Study（一種類乎硏究院的新興學園）的數學部長。</p>
<p>希特拉上臺後，因所謂排猶運動，沒收了愛因斯坦的財產，並搜索其住宅，使愛不得不離德他去。一九三三年三月二十八日彼復正式通知退出普魯士學會；愛因斯坦大致不再會回到日耳曼的懐抱中去了。同年九月十八日第八次德國物理學會在柏林開會，著名保守的物理學者馬克斯。豐。威的演說，很可以說明德學術界對於愛因斯坦出走的感想。他說：「今年（一九三三年）六月二十二日為伽里略因地動說而受宗敎裁判的三百年紀念，這裁判的意義可以不用細說，想不到在二十世紀的今日，還見到和道裁判類似的情形，就是相對性原理的被歧視。」言外之意，是很可以令人深思的。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>國難時期的靑年讀物</h3>
<p>— 堅</p>
<p>中華民族現在是當着一個空前的國難時期，一切政治，經濟，軍事，敎育等，都應當適應這個時期的需要。最近幾個月中在政治，經濟，軍事等方面的改革，假如細心地分析一下，我們就可知道其意義的嚴重與偉大。過去敎育當局召集專家討論國難敎育方案，也無非要和政治等發生聯繫，確立非常時敎育的中心目標。</p>
<p>我們的出版界，也應當在這時確立一個中心的方針，俾合於國難時期的需要，這非特出版界應當有這種覺悟，我想一般讀者也是迫切地期待着的吧！</p>
<p>一切出版物中，靑年是最大的主顧，這一方面有許多靑年尙在求學時期，時期和經濟都允許他們讀書，同時，靑年的求知慾比較旺盛，因此靑年讀物就充斥在現在的出版市塲了。</p>
<p>我們知道，靑年是民族的靈魂，國家的中堅，尤其當此國家民族危急存亡之秋，復興民族的重任是放在靑年的肩上，因此，靑年所負責任之巨大，也就可想而知。</p>
<p>靑年的使命旣如此重大，那麼，作為靑年精神的糧食的靑年讀物，其重要當然也是不待言的。</p>
<p>但是我們看一看現在市上所流行的靑年讀物是怎樣的情形呢？甲書局出了一本靑年書信，乙書局也就來一本靑年的幾封信；這個書局出了一本靑年的修養，那個書局又來一本靑年的訓練；內客都是千篇一律，說來說去無非那幾句話，有些書還把不良的觀念液輸到靑年的腦子裏去，使靑年走向錯誤的道道，讀了這種書，自然更是有害無益了！</p>
<p>因此，在國難的現階段，我們對於過去的靑年讀物應該淸算一下，作一番嚴正的檢討。對於現在靑年讀物的編著，應該確立一個目標。淸算過去，且待以後有機會時再談；現在且來談談在這空前的國難時期，我們需要怎樣的靑年讀物。</p>
<p>第一，應當確立中心的意識，過去的許多靑年讀物所以不能，收到很大的效果，主要的是沒有一種中心思想的支配，在此國難時期，我們需耍統一的思想，統一的步伐，這樣，對外纔有力量，纔有勝利的把握。我們除了作政治經濟軍事等的準備外，更需要意識的總動員！因此，統一靑年的思想，使集合於同一的目標之下，這是現階段中最迫切而需要的工作。致於什麼纔是國難時期靑年的中心間咫　，這是有待於專家的討論，定出一個綱領來。</p>
<p>第二，應當灌輸國難的知識。我們的民族當此空前的國難時期，靑年們隨時都要作動員的準備，那麼，一切國防知識，軍事知識，自然需要有明確的認識。比如說，我們的國防綫是在什麼地方，什麽是國防的危機，我國的資源，人口，以及各種戰時知識，防空常識，都是現在的靑年所急於需要明瞭的。</p>
<p>中心意識的確立，是一種精神建設運動；國難知識的灌輸，是屬於科學技術方面的；有了統一的精神，纔能有效地應用知識技術，作持久的戰爭！</p>
<h3>非常時財政論</h3>
<p>— 沈麐</p>
<p>尹文敬著　商務出版</p>
<p>由於國際風雲的險惡，二次世界大戰的爆發已成「箭在弦上」之勢。在人類將重罹浩刦的前夜裏，中國的非常時財政該怎樣主持呢？關於這個回答，出版界上儘有大量的「戰時經濟學」的論著與譯作應世，然而遺憾得很，一般譯作則多偏於一個國度方面，故僅能作借鏡之資料，而少切實之關聯，至於一般零碎的論著，則又多語焉不詳，而且重於史料之輯集，而輕於就現時現地而立論。會要使國人能對此非常時期之財政作一合理之檢討，於是有尹文敬先生的「非常時財政論」一書出。記者的意見認為道是一部好書，不論對財政學初讀或熟讀的人，他都能在書裏鳥瞰到了歷史的環境，幷領會到了中國之姿態。</p>
<p>尹先生在序文裹他吿訴了我們要硏究非常財政的理由：『……不過，我們雖不參戰，却難免別人的挑戰，防衛的能力，總不能不先事準備。所謂「國不競亦陵，何國之為？」况且非常財政幷不限於作戰期間，和作戰國家，國際政治與經濟，是息息相關的，並不要我們與人相見疆塲，纔受戰爭影響，纔該有戰時準備，就是他國與他國戰，也一樣感受威脅，一樣地可使財政金融，發生恐慌。中國財政有百分之八十以上，靠着消費稅收入，關稅又佔其中的最大部分，這種稅收，是極易感受國際戰爭影響而减少的。他方面政府通融財政的塲所，僅恃搖搖欲墜的上海金融市塲，道也是一遇戰爭，便有立刻崩潰之危險的。我國財政，戰時怎樣？眞令人不堪設想！這便是我們要研究非常財政的理由。』至於非常財政論中的要旨，作者指出：『本書所指的非常時，是包括戰時和戰前戰後的財政處理，同時對於各國現階段的財政恐慌和應付方法，也將一一與以解答，與以分析。』</p>
<p>本書內容，共分十章：首章為一般財政之意義與現象之解說，二三四章為非常財政之要義實質之槪述，並叙及戰時之戰費籌集之道。對於首次大戰之紙幣租稅公債徵發的史考與其學理上之討論，莫不精析詳剖。末二章則綜論各國非常狀態下之財政，與現階段的中國財政。著者認為中國財政早已入於非常階段上，其程度並且亦不在戰後各國之下，而其危險性更有過之。他說：『但是說到非常財政的條件，却又無一具備。在收入方面，可以斷言稅收是不足以應支出之需，量出為入的經常原則，早已不能實現。而且稅制是極端的畸形，幾乎全部分是無產大衆的負担，近年因厲行加稅的結果，以及經濟恐慌的影響，稅源已不勝負担，日漸乾枯之虞。一旦戰爭發生，或恐慌加重，其涸便可立而待。這是值得最注意的一層。在支出方面，又因各項經費省無可省，無由實現量入為出的原則，使預算平衡。而且軍債費的比例太大，使財政過於非常化了，因此遂不能不有鉅額的公債積累，債額愈高，債費的支出愈鉅；軍費愈多，或者國內的戰事愈密；財政自不免因此而江河日下。在他方面如金融組織的不健全，貨幣制度的不確立，國民經濟的日卽衰微等等，均在在足以影響財政。』</p>
<p>作者在末段的結論上，對症發藥提出三項改革之道：第一，在稅收方面，應該建立完備的租稅制度，並　立强有力的關稅政策。第二，在支出方面，應力减非常支出的範圍，幷願望在社會上倡勵節的。第三，在貨幣金融方面，應該立刻與有關係各國，討論具體辦法，不能因循聽其自然惡化。當局對此三項苟能實踐，而後財政前途庶有望焉！</p>

<h3>蘇州抗租風潮</h3>
<p>— 紹</p>
<p>在蘇州抗租風潮初起的時候，輿論界曾經一致請求常局，不要過事操切，採用高壓手段。因為這種事件並不是强制方法所能解决的。事情後來稍為緩和，我們正引以為欣慰，以為如果從此能因勢利導，勸諭農民，另外找出一個合理的辦法，則事件可以得到很良好的結果。但上月二十六日報上便有一段消息，說蘇州因强制繳租，保安隊與農民發生衝突，致死傷十餘人之多。</p>
<p>人民抗租，當然是違背法律的，理宜禁止，但是我們不能單純把牠當作不法事件，呆板的依法處理。而要明白牠的原因，因情制宜。蘇州農民豈眞冥頑不靈，自甘犯法？為什麽數十百年來，年年繳納的田租，如今反不肯繳出？報紙上曾屢次指出，這種風潮的主因，就是歷年虫旱為災，收成大歉，農民自身衣食且難顧及，何能尙有餘力來納田租？試看今日的天堂的蘇州，餓殍多少？甚至賣兒女也不能維持。而且整個農村經濟都陷於崩潰，資源枯竭，卽有貨也賣不了，耍他們拿出什麽來？此外，當局所採取的徵收方法「分圖普减」，也有不當。更聽從業主的說話，向佃戶逼租，益使農民憤怒。</p>
<p>我很同意歷次報上舉出的補救辦法，根本耍謀整個中國的農村的複興，這是一個主要的大前提。我們很高興聽到當局現在提出復興農村的口號。但是我們希望眞能够實實在在做去。</p>
<h3>參觀南翔立達園藝塲</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>上次，我參觀了江灣的立達養鷄塲之後，使我對於農村副業發生了很大的與趣，同時知道立達學園除了這養鷄塲之外，南翔方面還有一個圍藝塲及農村服務部。所以頗想找個機會，到那裏也去參觀一下。可是人事勞碌，延擱了下來，一直到如今。</p>
<p>乘小火車到了南翔，在鎭上打聽到了立達園藝塲的地址；知道它並不在南翔，而却是在離開南翔有八哩路的柴塘鄕，是屬於南翔管轄的，從火車站出發，由蘇滬公路一直能够通到柴塘，不必</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>轉灣抹角；因此非常容易記憶。因為順便想視察一下鄉村情形，就徒步走去。但是走到封家　橋的時候，却飄起毛毛雨來了。並且愈下愈緊。</p>
<p>好容易才望到了立達園藝場在叢林密茂中露出了一個輪廓來，當我勉强跨進他們的辦公室的廊下，雨就傾盆似的瀉下來了。</p>
<p>我向一位學員說明了來意，請他通知一聲這裏的張主任，那學員答應着去了，他呌我們在閱報室裏坐一回。不久，他來把我們引到了中央那個辦公室裏，張主任很謙虛的招待着，並且將一切情形都不厭求詳的告訴了我們。</p>
<p>他說：這裏也是隸屬於上海立達學園的。周圍雖有八百多畝地產（係租借的），然而已經懇植者却不過四十多畝。這四十多中間，除了二十畝己開魚池外，其他都種的是花卉，菓樹，蔬菜等。那裏有一個高中農村教育科，和一個完全小學。高中農村教科裏是不收學費的，每學期祗取膳費雜費以及一切賠償費等五十八元，但必須住宿場中，而在場裏實習。三年畢業，畢業後或留場中服務，或　到别處農場裏去工作。</p>
<p>這一科裏現在只收得學員四十名。完全小學部份，現在已經有學生二百多人，那全是周圍附近的農家孩子，這裏略收學費。</p>
<p>高中農村教育科裏的課程，現暫設計分農藝，畜牧，農村輔導等三種，其他各種必需的學課，他們現在正在設法逐漸的擴充。</p>
<p>少停，雨住了，張先生便引導着我到各處去參觀了一周。</p>
<p>這裏的環境非常幽靜，風景也十分秀麗，綠樹蔭濃森木葱蘢的很有點鄉村風味。正中有兩埭平屋；右邊的一埭是學員的宿舍及工役室，農具間。左邊的除了一間辦公室，一間圖書室，一間閱報室，此外，便是兩間教職員休息室。最左就是小學部，和郵政箱。前面，一個很大的魚池，後面也有一個荷池。由一條小橋過去，那裏有一秘診療所，傍邊是一個小型的養雞場。養雞場前，是兩個植物溫床，和一間植物溫室。</p>
<p>關於作物方面，菓樹部份有蔬果，葡萄，林擒，桃子（現己結實，以紙袋裏着以防虫蝕）等十多種，園藝部份，除了一切花卉盆景外，還有各種瓜實蔬菜。荷池裏却植有荷花，慈菇之類。畜牧部份却祗有蜂，鴿，雞等幾種。</p>
<p>他們對於當地農村也頗多貢獻，譬如棉花，他們研究得土種的不好，於是便購了許多改良種來分贈給當地的農民，教他們試植，如果成績好的話，但凖備普遍的提倡，改植改良棉。</p>
<h3>中毒者</h3>
<p>— 以一</p>
<p>老于自南口回來了，使我很覺奇怪的是老于竟然完全活變了，以前是强健活潑，現在却正相反的消瘦下來　只剩下皮包着骨頭。兩眼深深的陷了下去，没有一點兒血色；全身的顏色只有蒼白，死灰色的蒼白；變了，他整個兒的變了。</p>
<p>在我心頭上像是懷着一個不可解的謎，三年來不見，他竟然變得這樣快呵，想不到。</p>
<p>昨天他來了，像是一個久病的老人似的氣喘着，他用兩雙抖戰的手緊緊地抓住我，但我覺得他底手是冰冷而無力，他笑着，也是那樣勉强，總之，我對他底一切都覺得生疎了，像是從來没曾接觸着過這麼個人，這麼個可怕的陌生的人。</p>
<p>「你好呵！……」他無力的說着，他用那兩雙深陷而無神的眼睛望着我。我没說什麼，只點了點頭。</p>
<p>「哼！…（他苦笑了一下），你覺得奇怪嗎？你是做夢也不會想得到我會變成這個樣子的吧，哼！可是我却一點也不覺得奇怪，因為我所見到的像我這樣的人太多了，咳！……有什麼可奇怪的呢！……」</p>
<p>他氣喘着，聲音有些接不上來，他臉上起着陣陣地痛苦的痙攣，他要乾嗽，他抬起抖戰的手無力的搥打着凹下的胸部，當時我像是失去了知覺，又覺得眼前是一個靈無的幻像，我注意的注意着他的每一個細小的動作，我聽他繼續講下去。</p>
<p>「告訴你吧老楊，（他提高了聲音，我，我是中了毒了！中了毒了！没有救了！我己竟是個無用的人了……」</p>
<p>「怎麼？」中了毒嗎？……</p>
<p>「哼！好利害，好利害！…媽的毒化政策！哼，（他一拳打在桌子上，他憤怒的張着眼睛，像要撕裂一件什麼怪物似的他使勁握着那枯瘦的拳頭。）…完了，這一輩子便這樣的完了！（他的聲音低沉下去了。）</p>
<p>他又慢慢地歪了歪身子，在衣袋里掏出了一包東西來。</p>
<p>「瞧，就是這個！這是白面的一種最兇的一種了…哼！…媽媽的…呵…」他像是不勝疲憊似的軟軟地靠在背椅上了。</p>
<p>「你怎麼會，會學上這種東西呢？路局里能…」</p>
<p>「你又哪里曉得呢，哼！××人，高麗棒子們的方法多得很，…先是送給你，說是可以治什麼病，又竭力誘你去上當，於是你接受了，日子以長那是非有癮不可了，那時我没有錢給他們，他們公然向路局里去要，在薪水中扣除…所以差事也弄掉了……」說着他就把那些白面來例在一塊包香烟的錫紙裏，在下邊用火一烤，那些白面立刻化了化成了水珠，像水銀似的亂滾，於是他一下子便倒在嘴里了。</p>
<p>這樣的吃法，實在令我驚奇了。</p>
<p>「哼！…（他從容不迫的說）這，你没曾見過吧！…這樣的吃法在北方，南口一帶是太普通了！這個吃法是大　的才能來的呵！…哼……」</p>
<p>「在，在南口有上千上萬，無數的人都中了毒！職員也有，學生也有，…尤其是下力的勞働者們和工人…他們都中毒了！都中毒了！…我自己很明白，又有哪個中了毒的人不明白？但是晚了，晚了！…唉！…毒化政策……哼！…」</p>
<p>他底聲間是那樣的低沉，那樣傷　，他竟落淚了！</p>
<p>「這樣下去不消幾年就都成了無用的人了……」他哽咽的悲淒的說着，他用無力的拳頭打在桌子上，他倒在桌子上哭了。</p>
<p>我没有一句話，　　找不到一句適當的話去安慰　　　　　。</p>
<h3>砲臺灣</h3>
<p>— 陳里昂</p>
<p>在倦怠的身心，　不着休沐的快慰下，又使我悄然地懷念起舊遊的江堤：砲台灣。這地方，嘗使我興奮而喊呌，亦嘗使我悲哀而飲泣，所給予人們的刺激和感應，或許就永遠不能和諧？這地方，嘗充溢着愛之喜悦，生物自然之情的表現，可是，一個時期，却密佈了戰爭的恐怕，有過人類乖戾的大屠殺。出過明媚的太陽，亦吹過暴急的旋風。清朗，陰沉，晴，雨……？在這時代，這地，這環境，誰預料得到？誰又能說得肯定？</p>
<p>天時與人事是一樣的難測，當我踏上蒸汽車的時候，猶是藍色的天空與白亮的太陽。不料下車時，己無陽光可見，天空變得灰暗。於是，我有所驚惕，有所深慮了…人決不能希冀一個良好的時間與環境永存的，或者，當正在欣悦幸福之降臨的刹那，而災禍己從橫裹或背後偷襲而來。一枝曇花，一個綺麗夢，一抹彩雲…都作如是觀，如是想。在車站到砲台灣的煤屑路上，雖有少年與少女的膩語和蜜笑，小學生們的歌聲，以及幾個異國男女那種放浪的形態之使人可笑，可是，我的心內，却愈加沉鬰起來了。</p>
<p>砲台外形，依然是淞滬戰役的舊觀，高高的泥土墩阜，青堆磚砌的瞭望台，長列的木椿與有銳刺的鐵絲綱，環繞土墩的水溝，它們從失敗未得逞志的懊喪中而含帶着嚴肅感，所給予我的感應與刺激，依然是興奮悲哀的交錯，再加受到陰沉的天時的反應，週遭更形黯晦，把幾年前鐵血同迸裂的悲壯，重復顯出來，我的脚步遲緩，幾乎欲止，我的血液發出高熱，幾乎欲集中心房而爆炸，此時，我己聽見不到膩語，蜜笑，歌聲，以及放浪的形態。心中在企求，企求着一種嘹亮的號聲，衝破目前的陰暗。</p>
<p>漸漸，我自己亦明白：我過份的受到情感的衝動了，這對於我倦怠的身心是無益的。我趕快從苦惱的情感中解放出來。等到平心靜氣，細細流覽目前的景象時，太陽又從一大片灰色雲霓中探出頭來，春日草樹的生發，給予我一種有力的企示。記得上次來時，是在枯槁死寂的隆冬，而現在泥土墩阜上的柳樹，己吐出新綠，統統隨風飄拂，蒲公英鮮黄挺秀，開遍於曾受重創的砲台故址，一支小草，一雙飛鳥，一聲守兵的歌，督含有向榮的笑意。</p>
<p>我沿着那夾在綠草叢中的悠長的石板路直過去，消失了　鬰，悲哀，與悵茫。春風的流蕩中，我時時投給衛士以尊敬的　　微笑。有時，亦能從傾廢的缺壁口望見銹壞的砲管與砲座，這殘敗的陳蹟亦不必苦苦追憶，我們這一代正需要新的壁壘呵……我奔上了高堤，望到洶湧的揚子江的水，棕色的風帆，一縷黑烟拖在輪尾。</p>
<p>草灘上，許多小學生在唱歌：『—大—家—一—同—向—前—』。</p>
<h3>自來水筆</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>六年前的春天我在蘇州河畔一個英文專門學校裏讀書，就在那時我買了一支自來水筆，筆的名稱是那時頗盛行的「康克令」。因為第一次用自來水筆，所以用不慣。當我伏在桌子上正正板板寫一點文章的時候，用的是木筆桿，筆尖是用三個銅字買來的。但我覺得遠勝於自來水筆。</p>
<p>然而對我自來水筆並不是完全没用，當我聽課聽得無聊時，或是呆坐在桌旁無法排遣寂寞的，我常常抽出一張白紙，在白紙上塗些毫不連貫的字句。這樣，許多難挨的時光在這支自來水筆下葬送了。</p>
<p>秋天，　　　　　　　　自來水筆常在我的身邊。我不再感到它的陌生，我己能熟練地使用它了。晚上，靠在三層樓的窗口上，展望着夜的秋野的景色，零星的燈火，飛過樓頂的旅雁的哀呌，以及疾馳的隕滅的流星，都使我感到無底的寂寞。於是悄悄的鋪着紙，用我的自來水筆　　地寫，寫我的寂寞，寫我的悲思。一切心底的　傷，懊惱，我都借着自來水筆很自然地吐在紙上了。於是我和它的情感的基礎打得十分牢固。我不能没有它，它在我的生命道上佔有一個極重要的位置。</p>
<p>五六年來為了寂寞，　傷，在這支自來水筆下吐出的字己不可計算了。去年秋天我離開都市到鄉間來教書，統一的隨員就是這支自來水筆。然而環境己不許我在寂寞，　傷中打轉了。擔任的課程又是最苦的國文，於是也大部份時間都被課卷，筆記　蝕去了。用的又是毛筆，於是難得有機會去握自來水筆。直到深夜夢回，冷月照窗，微風飄過窗前的老柏樹我再也不能睡覺的時候　起　握着自來水筆寫上一二篇短文。然而我没有忘掉它，反像對一個不能常見的情人似的，我的對它的　戀有着幾分感傷性的。</p>
<p>也許被課卷等東西厭得昏了吧，那支自來水筆終於給我失掉了。我費盡了力量去找，終於没有下落。如今己是夢醒的時候了，這個五六年來同甘苦的好情人呌我再從什麼地方去找它呢？追想夢中事，千端萬端，空遺没着落的惆悵而已。它的失蹤，是我的不小心的證明，這罪過除了我更有誰來負擔。</p>
<p>自來水筆的失去己是兩星期前的事情了，它的不回來己是不可掩飾的事實。但我的心底的空虛有什麼來填補呢？我懷念它，這懷念愈來愈濃，使我不能有片刻的時間釋然於心。寂寞，　傷，畢竟還没有在我的心底死滅，且為了自來水筆的失去，這寂寞，這　傷，有加無己的在襲　着我，我要提筆寫我寂寞，寫我的　傷，然而三個銅子的鋼筆尖我己用不慣了。没法，只得借着自來水筆寫。当我铺纸執笔的时候，彷彿聽見失去的自來水筆用着責難的口吻說：「但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭，？」其實，我何嘗有愉快，我在懷念着那支自來水筆，那支自來水筆上有着我的血和淚的。</p>
<p>每個寂寞的早晨，每個昏暗的黄昏，我帶着無涯際的　傷，在無能的盼望，盼望着那支自來水筆有一天會飄然的回來。</p>

<p>但金寶的愛人却是青年農人云哥。他倆是從小就在一塊兒玩；而且現在是生活在同一個被壓迫的環境裏的。</p>
<p>那一天，云哥提了一籃山芋送給光炎；並向光炎說明求婚的意思。但他被光炎趕去了。光炎以為云哥「也是做一天吃一天的，你跟了他，將來能不能養活你，現在還不能知道；並且他未必能幫我渡過今年的難關。」他當然不肯將金寶自由地嫁給云哥，破壞了他對田主的買賣。</p>

<h3>Guangdong Army Suddenly Bans Rice Transport into Western Fujian</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Yongding reports: The Guangdong army in Dabu recently suddenly banned the transport of rice from Fengshi into western Fujian, and also blockaded Lushi, prohibiting the transport of goods into western Fujian. General merchandise transported from Yongding to Lushi was confiscated. Furthermore, rice shipped from Shantou to Dabu from Shanghang was also confiscated. Currently, there is a rice shortage in Fengshi, and prices in Yongding have risen sharply. Rice in Shanghang has risen to five and a half sheng per yuan. It is reported that the commerce of Shanghang, Yongding, Changting, and Wuping in western Fujian enters and exits via the Youjiang River, with Fengshi, adjacent to Dabu on the Yongding border, serving as the main hub, trading with Chaoshan. A portion of the grain for Hangyong relies on foreign rice. Now that Guangdong has suddenly blockaded the area, merchants and residents in Hangyong are petitioning the county government for relief.

<h3>Guangxi Military Authorities Hire Overseas Chinese as Advisors; Overseas Chinese Support the Central Government and Decline Appointment</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Chen Shuren recently received a letter from overseas Chinese businessmen in Southeast Asia stating that during this recent unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Guangxi Fourth Group Army, in order to ease the goodwill of overseas Chinese towards the Southwest, specially appointed leaders of overseas Chinese communities in Malaysia and other places to important positions such as advisors to the army, in order to win them over. However, the overseas Chinese are eager to see their motherland well-governed and are mostly unwilling to accept the positions, which shows the sincerity of the overseas Chinese in thoroughly supporting the Central Government. Wang Zhenxiang, an overseas Chinese businessman, also previously received a letter of appointment from Li Bai, appointing him as an advisor to the army.

<h3>Long Yun Addresses Yunnan Students, Explaining Yunnan's Attitude of Supporting the Central Government and Opposing the False Pretense of Anti-Japanese Actions by Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) Since the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities disregarded the national discipline and the lives of the people, and moved their troops to invade the borders of Hunan, Fujian, and Jiangxi under the false pretense of anti-Japanese, the military and civilians here have been extremely indignant. Commander-in-Chief Long delivered a speech to the students at the Laoyingpan in the North Campus at 2 PM on June 25, expressing the political views of Guangdong and Guangxi using the excuse of resisting Japan, acting beyond the boundaries, and this province supporting the central government without betraying its original intention. The main points of the speech are as follows: "Students, you have all received higher education, your thoughts are pure, and you are the backbone of the country in the future. My original intention in coming here today was to meet with you and give a few words of encouragement, and I was not prepared to talk about the current situation. However, I think that you are all excellent young people, and it seems necessary to talk about the current situation. But before I talk about it, let me ask you, is the anti-Japanese action of Guangdong and Guangxi this time true or false?" (The students immediately answered loudly, "False.") "Since you all know that the anti-Japanese action of Guangdong and Guangxi this time is false, I can briefly describe the situation between Guangdong and Guangxi and the central government. Before the September 18th Incident, Guangdong and Guangxi already had different opinions towards the central government. However, the central government has always been tolerant, so the messengers between the two sides still traveled back and forth. Although Yunnan is adjacent to Guangxi Province, we have never agreed with their political views. We sincerely hope for the unity and unification of the country, and deeply hope that the Guangdong and Guangxi sides can put national affairs first. However, if Guangdong and Guangxi do not abandon their selfish and self-interested intentions, then their relationship with the central government will be difficult to improve. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the month, they launched their so-called anti-Japanese activities. People throughout the country saw through their intentions and knew that their words did not come from their hearts, and they did not gain sympathy. Now the actions of Guangdong and Guangxi are beyond the boundaries and have become a case of riding a tiger. It is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop in the future, but since the motive is bad, the result can be imagined. As for the attitude that Yunnan holds, we believe that China is composed of several provinces, but the relationship between the local and central governments is not an adversarial relationship, but a relationship of subordination. Yunnan Province should listen to the orders of the central government in terms of both law and fact. The political views of Yunnan have been the same for decades. In the past facts, there is evidence everywhere. During the era of the 18th year of the Republic, when the country was not yet unified, the Guangxi faction controlled half of the country, but Yunnan always opposed them. The Punitive Rebellion Army was formed at that time. Now the power of Guangdong and Guangxi is not what it used to be. Yunnan will naturally oppose Guangdong and Guangxi to the end, and only knows to support the central government to complete unification, without betraying its original intention. I sincerely hope that the students thoroughly understand the attitude of the authorities towards the central government and the current situation to determine their beliefs and do not believe in rumors."

<h3>Prospects for the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly opened the day before yesterday. This special assembly was convened at the proposal of Argentina. According to the note submitted by the Argentine government to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, the main tasks of this special assembly are to discuss the following three issues: the issue of sanctions against Italy, the declaration of non-recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, and the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant. Let us discuss the prospects of this League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly based on the recent attitudes of various countries.</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of sanctions against Italy, there is no doubt that this assembly will pass the proposal to lift sanctions. Since Italy launched its East African aggression war in October last year, the United Kingdom, due to its own interests, first launched economic sanctions against Italy in Geneva. Since Italy declared the annexation of Abyssinia, the United Kingdom has been preparing to lift the economic sanctions against Italy because the continuation of sanctions, in the view of the Conservative Party government, would not only fail to make Mussolini spit out the fat meat he had already swallowed, but would also further provoke Italy's resentment against the United Kingdom, hindering its vested interests in the Mediterranean and the Near East. Therefore, after multiple considerations, the Conservative Party government decided to lift economic sanctions against Italy at the cabinet meeting on June 17, and Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in Parliament outlining the three major reasons for the withdrawal. We will not discuss the reasons for the United Kingdom's withdrawal of sanctions against Italy, which is actually a diplomatic cover, but there is no doubt that it will decide to support or launch a proposal to withdraw sanctions in Geneva. After the British government decided to withdraw sanctions against Italy, the French People's Front cabinet also decided to support the British attitude. According to the political program of the French People's Front, the French government should not take this attitude. But given the current situation in which Italy and Germany are trying to form an aggressive bloc, France cannot but weigh the pros and cons and follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom. In addition to the United Kingdom and France, Poland also first implemented the complete lifting of sanctions against Italy at the end of last month. Although the attitudes of other countries have not been clearly expressed, there are probably very few who oppose lifting the sanctions. Therefore, judging from the attitudes of various countries, there is no doubt that the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly will pass the issue of lifting sanctions.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' lifting of sanctions against Italy is certainly a major blow to itself. In order to preserve some of its face, the League of Nations will certainly not recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia by force. In the note sent by Argentina to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, it stated that it could not recognize the legality of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. The original non-recognition of the legality of acquiring territory by force is the consistent diplomatic policy of the Argentine government. There are clear provisions in the South American Non-Aggression and Reconciliation Treaty it proposed. Other member states will also support this claim.</p>
<p>As for amending the Covenant, it is an inevitable result of the League of Nations' failure to impose sanctions on Italy. Although this motion is listed in this assembly, it may not be possible to discuss it to a result. The important question now is how to amend the Covenant. Various countries have already made many informal suggestions regarding the amendment of the Covenant. The United Kingdom wants to reduce the power of the League of Nations and make it a form of regional agreement. France advocates that the Covenant does not need to be amended, only to add annotations to Article 16. The added annotation is that neighboring countries with direct interests should impose military sanctions on aggressors, while other member states should only impose economic sanctions. The United Kingdom's proposal is to split the entire international peace and only seek its local security. If this proposal is adopted, the life of the League of Nations will also come to an end. France's proposal is the opposite. If it is adopted, the power of the League of Nations will be greater than before, and it will make a greater contribution to maintaining peace. The different attitudes of the United Kingdom and France have been once secretly discussed by Brun and Eden in Geneva, and it is said that a compromise has been reached. Then the future of the League of Nations seems to still have a glimmer of light, but the true power of international peace is still built on the enthusiastic support of the majority of the people around the world. This is what we should recognize. Song Orders Chen to Seek a Solution Quickly.</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The following is the full text of Chairman Lin's speech at the eleventh anniversary celebration of the National Government: "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the National Government. The National Government is a unique term in our country's history. It naturally has its special significance and shoulders a special historical mission. First, the National Government inherited the legacy of the Premier (Sun Yat-sen), ended the two-thousand-year-old autocratic system of emperors from one family, and the transitional situation of warlord strife and division since the founding of the Republic. Second, the National Government is a government that serves the people with ideology. The completion of military administration to people's governance of the National Government and the unification of the whole country can be said to be a victory of ideology. The ideology and policies conform to the will of the people nationwide, so it has received the support of all the people. Third, the National Government is implementing political tutelage to begin constitutional governance and has completed a new constitution of the Three Principles of the People—of the people, by the people, and for the people—for the Republic of China, laying an immortal foundation for the Republic of China. Once we understand the above points, we will know the greatness of the historical mission shouldered by the National Government and the importance of commemorating the founding of the National Government on July 1st. This year, which marks the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the National Government, is precisely the year when the National Government announced the draft constitution and decided to convene the National Assembly. After the start of constitutional governance and the establishment of the central government, the responsibility of the Kuomintang for the people of the Republic of China to instruct and guide can be declared complete. Therefore, the significance of this year's commemoration is different from that of previous years. I hope that the people of the whole country and the comrades of our party will remember the teachings of the Premier, recall the decades of difficult and arduous struggle of our party, and cherish and support this Republic of China with a sincere heart and all our strength, revitalize the nation, and reorganize the territory, so that we can be worthy of the Premier, the martyrs, and the compatriots of the whole country. At today's commemoration, I feel infinitely joyful and infinitely moved. In these turbulent times, let us cross the river in the same boat. I deeply hope to encourage each other with all of you and the compatriots and comrades of the whole country." (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>British Consulate in Peiping Continues Hearing on Sasaki Case</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The British Consul continued the hearing today on the death of Sasaki. Sotsuka, an employee of "Manchukuo," testified yesterday that he and Sasaki were chased by British soldiers when they left the Kanazawa Cafe in Hatamen on the night of the incident. Today, he further testified that when he returned to the scene from the hotel, he learned that Sasaki had not followed him into the hotel and saw Sasaki lying unconscious on the ground with an eye injury. However, he did not see any foreign soldiers at the time. He then discussed the matter with his friend Kambe in the store and sent Sasaki to the hospital. The witness also said that a piece of yellow cloth was found next to Sasaki's feet and has been submitted as evidence. He did not recognize who the soldiers who chased him were, nor did he recognize the soldiers who assaulted Sasaki. The British Consul then asked Sotsuka to identify the soldiers who committed the crime from the approximately twenty British soldiers in the court, but Sotsuka refused to identify them. Sotsuka was then questioned by a lawyer and replied that he returned to the scene of the incident from the hotel at 12:30 AM, but he could not remember whether Sasaki was wearing a military sword that night. After the examination of Sasaki's remains, they were cremated on the evening of May 29th, and the ashes were buried in a lama temple on May 30th. When asked by the defense lawyer representing the defendant whether Sotsuka called the police when he discovered Sasaki lying on the ground, Sotsuka replied that he did not seem to have called them and could not remember clearly. The court continued in the afternoon to read the transcript of Sotsuka's testimony. Sotsuka requested corrections, which took several hours. Subsequently, the Japanese assessor and the King's Counsel, Mr. Pollock, had a dispute. That night, Onishi, a Japanese resident of Shenyang, was also injured in the No. 27 bar. When a Chinese waiter named Mao was called to testify, he testified that at twelve o'clock on the night of May 26th, two policemen came to the store. They often came, but this time they were wearing thick winter clothes and canvas belts. The witness then pointed to Kirk and Hunt from among the soldiers in the court, saying that they were the two. Kirk entered a room where a waitress was sitting with a Japanese customer. The witness spoke in Chinese, and the interpreter told him to stop speaking. Okamura, the Second Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, shouted, "Let him speak!" The King's Counsel, Mr. Pollock, said, "Mr. Okamura, please excuse me. I am in charge of this inquiry, and I intend to handle it." Okamura said, "Please let the Chinese police chief translate. Clayton (the interpreter) is obstructing the witness. I object to it. I have this right." Pollock said, "You have no such right." After the dispute, Pollock continued the inquiry. "First, tell the Chinese police chief that Mr. Clayton's translation is incorrect. Please tell him immediately." The witness then continued, saying that after the soldier entered the room, the Japanese customer quickly came out with a head injury and bleeding. The British soldier chased after him and entered the street. Hunt stood at the door when Kirk entered the room. The two soldiers then left the store at the same time. The witness was questioned and replied that the Japanese customer arrived at the store a few minutes before midnight, and the two soldiers arrived at the store when the bell rang twelve times. The witness further stated that Kirk and Hunt were army police officers, so they often came to the store. At this point, Okamura interrupted again. Pollock then asked the interpreter whether the witness had said that the two removed their armbands when they were drunk. The interpreter said that the witness often said unrelated things. Then the witness said again that he had said, "The two caused trouble when they were drunk." After being questioned, the witness said that Hunt and Kirk removed their shoulder straps when they were drunk. The two often drank alcohol and caused trouble in the bar. The court then adjourned, and the hearing was scheduled to continue tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Denies That Customs Superintendents Are Not Allowed to Interfere in Anti-Smuggling in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recent reports and special dispatches in various newspapers stated that the Ministry of Finance had issued an order to all customs superintendents that all anti-smuggling cases, regardless of their nature, should be handled entirely by the Customs Service, and that the customs superintendents should not interfere. An official of the Ministry of Finance has now formally denied this, saying that customs superintendents have the responsibility to supervise all customs affairs, and anti-smuggling is also one of the customs affairs.

<h3>French Premier's Speech: Emphasizing Strengthening the Effectiveness of Alliances, Peace Based on International Morality and Collective Security, Focusing on Military Disarmament. South African Representative Opposes Lifting Sanctions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At a special meeting of the League of Nations today, the representative of the Union of South Africa, Watte, delivered an impassioned speech, strongly advocating the maintenance of sanctions against Italy, saying that the government of the Union of South Africa believes that the suggestion to lift sanctions would only be regarded as a surrender of the League of Nations' authority. Not only because the League of Nations is unable to preserve that authority, but also because it recognizes that the League of Nations does not have the necessary sacrifices to fulfill its obligations, which would fatally injure the League of Nations. Next, French Premier Blum delivered a speech, saying that France not only maintains its own peace, but also maintains the indivisible peace of Europe. France will concentrate its strength so that collective security can be realized. The obligations under the League of Nations Covenant must be strengthened. The obligations of the League of Nations must be more clearly defined. France cannot agree to any amendment to the Covenant that would make the League of Nations merely a consultative body. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly continued at 10:30 this morning. First, the representative of Colombia, Durbe, delivered a speech, saying that various interests acquired through acts of aggression should not be recognized. He then put forward three requests:</p>
<p>The principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant should be universally applied to all member states.</p>
<p>The Covenant should be supplemented.</p>
<p>The situation of peace should be maintained, and war should be regarded as illegal.</p>
<p>At this point, French Premier Blum took the stage to deliver a speech at 11:15 AM, which was divided into six sections. The first section was used to explain the situation of the French cabinet. He said, "Some say that France has encountered a crisis since the labor unrest. In fact, 'our public life is very exciting, which is the real situation. But the most exciting nation in the world is neither weak nor selfish.'" The second section said, "For the French nation, surrendering to force or willingly recognizing the fait accompli is not the same as maintaining peace, because peace should be based on law and international morality." The third section said, "Eighteen years have passed since the end of the European War. To this day, there is still the possibility of a second world war breaking out on the European continent, which France must resolutely prevent." The fourth section said that the best way to prevent war is not to amend the League of Nations Covenant, "but to implement the provisions of the Covenant in a practical way, so that there is no doubt. With regard to this, any amendment that would reduce the power of the League of Nations, allowing it to become an academic consulting body, the French government cannot agree to." The fifth section said that France is prepared to accept any measures that can increase the effectiveness of the Covenant. "In short, international obligations that have been declared and accepted by various countries will not be effective unless there is a determination to persist to the end. Although we already have the same feeling in this regard, persisting to the end means accepting the danger of war, because if we want to maintain peace, we must go out to fight when necessary." The sixth section said that all countries are now "maintaining arms or maintaining excessive arms." If the nations of all countries are thinking about collective security, they should recognize the crisis of war and its cruel consequences. In short, we should not talk about collective security unless we do, but if we want to talk about collective security, then the implementation of military disarmament is essential.</p>
<p>After Blum finished his speech, the audience applauded thunderously, which was very different from the silence at the beginning of the speech. Observers also declared that since the death of the late French Foreign Minister Briand, Léon Blum is the first person to deliver an idealistic speech at the League of Nations. The General Assembly then announced a recess and continued the meeting at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Canadian Representative Lowe, and South African Representative DeWet will deliver speeches in succession.

<h3>League of Nations Assembly Opening Day: Emperor of Abyssinia Delivers a Moving Speech, Personally Describes Italian Military Tactics as Inhumane, and Pleads for the World's Small and Weak Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Assembly held a special meeting to consider the Abyssinian-Italian dispute and agreed to seriously consider lifting sanctions against Italy. The Emperor of Abyssinia personally attended and delivered a speech denouncing Italy and the League of Nations. Speaking solemnly in Amharic, the Emperor's deeply moving address was one of the most touching speeches ever heard in the history of the League of Nations Assembly. In his speech, he lamented the horrific conditions of the war waged by the Italian army in East Africa, criticized the actions of certain member states of the League of Nations, and finally pleaded for the League of Nations to intervene and save his desperate people. When the Emperor spoke, the entire venue was silent, and all the delegates listened intently. The Emperor concluded, "What answer shall I return to my people?" At this point, applause and cheers erupted like thunder. This sound was repeated when the Emperor left the venue.</p>
<p>The Argentine representative spoke first, strongly advocating that land seized by force should not be recognized, and implied that if genuinely universal principles of justice could not be obtained, Argentina would have to reconsider whether to remain a member of the League of Nations. His words were sincere and moving.</p>
<p>Then the Emperor of Abyssinia strode onto the podium to make a final stand for his lost empire. The atmosphere in the entire venue became tense and utterly silent. The Emperor's speech was simultaneously translated into various languages through communication devices.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, the Emperor declared that no head of state had ever attended the League of Nations Assembly, and the League of Nations had never encountered a country being wiped off the map by unheard-of barbaric tactics. The Emperor then detailed the horrific use of poison gas by the Italian army in the East African war. Italian air squadrons, ranging from as few as nine to as many as eighteen aircraft, sprayed poison gas across the ground, killing soldiers, civilians, and livestock upon contact. Grasslands and drinking water were also poisoned. There is no place more fitting than the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva to condemn such cruel tactics, and I have brought the eyewitness accounts of my comrades as proof. Therefore, my presence here today is to present evidence against the crimes committed against my people. The Emperor continued, saying that the efforts to unify Abyssinia had been undermined by Italian conspiracies, and Italy's war of aggression was intolerable under the League of Nations Covenant and civilized standards. Italy had been preparing for its war against Abyssinia for fourteen years. If some European country had not made it its business to appease Italy, the situation would not have developed this way. A secret treaty changed the entire situation. The Emperor then said in a heavy voice, "When fifty-two countries, including some of the strongest in the world, assured me last October that the aggressor would not succeed, I firmly believed that the victor would be the League of Nations. Who would have thought that things would go so terribly wrong? Italy had abundant supplies of weapons, while various countries imposed arms embargoes, preventing Abyssinia from receiving any military supplies. I ask, did these fifty-two countries provide genuine assistance to Abyssinia in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant?" "I am here today also for the sake of safeguarding the world's small and weak nations. Looking around at the nations, there are three major European powers that have not imposed sanctions on Italy. Among the other countries, some governments have declared that they adhere to the principles of the League of Nations, but their words are insincere, and they continue to take various steps to prevent these principles from being put into action. Abyssinia requested financial assistance from various countries, but they all turned a deaf ear. The railway to Djibouti was closed to Abyssinia, while Italy could use it at will. Is this neutrality? This problem cannot be resolved in this state. The entire international morality is now in danger. I urge the League of Nations to intervene to save my desperate people. God and history will remember your decisions," he said.</p>
<p>After the Emperor finished speaking, the Assembly announced that the meeting would be adjourned until 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Elected Chairman: Reads Italian Memorandum; Argentine Representative Clarifies Position: Does Not Recognize Land Seized by Force</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's special meeting convened this afternoon at 5:00 p.m. British Foreign Secretary Eden, in his capacity as Chairman of the Executive Council, first acted as temporary chairman and presented the resignation letter of the Assembly's chairman, Czech President Beneš, for reading. Delegates from the attending countries then elected a new chairman. As a result, Belgian Prime Minister Janson received 47 votes out of 51 and was elected. He immediately took his seat and delivered a speech, providing an overview of the international situation. He stated that today marks a crucial juncture since the founding of the League of Nations, and its position is extremely difficult. "But I still trust that the various countries will be able to restrain their expectations and dissatisfactions regarding their own nations, and prioritize the great cause of world peace." At this point, Prime Minister Janson presented the memorandum sent yesterday by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano for reading (see separate telegram). Then, Argentine representative Cantilo delivered a lengthy speech explaining why Argentina had requested the Assembly to convene earlier, stating that the purpose of this move was to allow all countries to attend the Assembly, explain their views, and take responsibility. He also stated, "The Pan-American Conference had previously declared its respect for the principle of territorial integrity of all countries (referring to not recognizing land conquered by force). I now reaffirm this in the name of the Argentine government. My government also firmly believes that the League of Nations Assembly, under any circumstances, should also reaffirm the above principle. But if the implementation of the League of Nations Covenant cannot be reconciled with the views held by the American countries, then my country will have to reconsider its future cooperation with the League of Nations," and so on. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Content of the Italian Memorandum: Geneva Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano recently sent a memorandum to the League of Nations, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Looking back to December of last year, when former French Prime Minister Laval and former British Foreign Secretary Hoare jointly drafted a solution to the Abyssinian-Italian dispute, the Italian government was originally prepared to seriously consider it. However, the Emperor of Abyssinia rejected it on the 9th of that month without waiting for Italy to express its opinion, and therefore the above plan became ineffective." After the decisive battle between the Italian and Abyssinian armies in April of this year, the Emperor of Abyssinia suffered defeat and fled into exile. This battle was actually initiated by the Emperor of Abyssinia taking the offensive. At this moment, taking responsibility for the new situation in Abyssinia, creating a new order for Abyssinia, guaranteeing peace, and promoting common development are Italy's duties and cannot be shirked. "Italy has provided solemn promises to the Abyssinian people to maintain order, establish peace, and, in accordance with Italy's culture and traditional policies, promote Abyssinia's development spiritually and materially. Regarding this, indigenous people should also be allowed to participate and cooperate in cultural indoctrination efforts, and advisory bodies organized by Italians will provide assistance. This body has now been organized and established under the leadership of the Governor-General of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>"Italy is now also prepared to abide by the following principles: Indigenous people will not bear the obligation of military service and will only be organized into police forces to maintain local order and protect the land; Special actions will be taken to ensure the freedom of transportation and to ensure that the trade of all countries receives fair treatment."</p>
<p>Mentioning the issue of Italy's future cooperation with the League of Nations, it is said that Italy is prepared to resume cooperation with the League of Nations in order to seek solutions to the various difficult problems related to the fate of Europe and the world. "However, Italy firmly believes that the current organization of the League of Nations needs to be appropriately reformed. This view has been accepted by most countries. Italy hereby reiterates this and is prepared to actively participate in the work of reform. As far as international cooperation is concerned, Italy is very willing to join in the grand effort. However, Italy's abnormal situation, which is enough to hinder cooperation, should be eliminated as soon as possible," and so on. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano sent a memorandum to the League of Nations yesterday to declare his country's position on Abyssinia, the Abyssinian representative recently submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations to refute the Italian memorandum. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Seven Neutral European Nations Express Doubt About the Covenant, Strongly Advocate for the Necessity of Revision</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the representatives of seven countries—Denmark, Spain, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland—passed a resolution expressing doubts about whether the conditions for their obligations under the League of Nations Covenant still exist and acknowledging the necessity of revising the Covenant to consolidate collective security. It is generally believed that this resolution is tantamount to indicating that unless the League of Nations Covenant is revised and sanctions against Italy are made more effective, these seven countries will refuse to participate in any other sanctions. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>The Emperor of Abyssinia's Attendance at the Assembly Sparks Reactions in Rome, Considered Detrimental to Italy's Cooperation with Europe</h3>
<p>(Rome) Allowing the Emperor of Abyssinia to attend the League of Nations Assembly has caused a negative impact in Italy and is seen as detrimental to Italy's proposal to cooperate with Europe and the League of Nations. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Occupy the City of Moyale, Bordering British Kenya</h3>

<h3>Italian Journalists Demonstrate; Unprecedented Chaos at the League of Nations Assembly; Whistles Blow Madly in the Gallery, Disrupting Order; Eight People Detained, Subject to Swiss Legal Sanctions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Unprecedented chaos erupted today at the League of Nations Assembly, stemming from a demonstration by many Italian journalists against the Emperor of Abyssinia. Delegates from all countries and people in the gallery expressed indignation towards the demonstrators, and order was once in a worrying state. Just as those who saw it were in awe, suddenly many Italian journalists stood up, shouting loudly and blowing whistles madly. The entire venue was outraged and immediately took counter-demonstrative action against the Italian journalists. The gallery also applauded in unison to express sympathy for the Emperor of Abyssinia. President of Belgium, Janson, summoned many policemen to rush to the journalists' seats to expel the journalists from the venue. Unexpectedly, these people resisted with their fists, and for a time, the order was chaotic, but they were eventually forcibly dragged out by the police and taken to the police station. On the way, the crowd verbally abused the journalists, saying that their arrest was gratifying. According to records, since the establishment of the League of Nations, this was the first time police officers entered the assembly to arrest people. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, in the press gallery of the League of Nations Assembly, an anti-Emperor of Abyssinia demonstration broke out, followed by multiple fights, resulting in four arrests, including one Italian newspaper reporter. Approximately twelve journalists were involved in the incident, including well-known Italian writers such as Ciani, the president of the Italian Fascist Journalists Association, and Professor Capri of the University of Milan. They will likely be prohibited from entering the League of Nations in the future. After the Chairman of the Assembly, Belgian Prime Minister Janson, delivered his opening remarks, shouts and whistles erupted in the gallery, prompting the summoning of police and ushers to suppress the disturbance. The demonstrators resisted, resulting in one Italian journalist having his jaw struck and being knocked to the ground by an usher, who happened to be the European light boxing champion. That journalist tried to stop another colleague from being expelled from the gallery. During the fight, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who was standing nearby, shouted, "Stop this barbaric behavior!" The Emperor of Abyssinia watched silently, without showing alarm, but was clearly saddened. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to eyewitnesses on the scene, the Italian journalists were sitting in two rows, not with other journalists, and each carried a whistle, indicating that the demonstration was not a spontaneous occurrence, but rather pre-arranged. Among them were two editors, several Italian reporters stationed in Geneva, and others who had come from Italy. Before the Emperor of Abyssinia took the stage to speak, the Chairman of the Assembly, Belgian Prime Minister Janson, announced, "Please welcome His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie to the stage." The Italian Consul-General in Geneva, who is also the leader of the Fascist Party branch, Spacher, was originally in the diplomatic corps seating area, but upon hearing the Chairman's words, immediately left his seat. At the same time, the Italian journalists staged their demonstration and were eventually arrested by the police. They are now being interrogated by the police authorities. Prosecutor Gounot and Police Chief Godard are currently consulting on the measures to be taken, and a decision is expected later tonight. Generally, if the Emperor of Abyssinia or the Swiss local authorities file a complaint, then the journalists will be prosecuted by the court. If so, the punishment will be severe, because Swiss law has clear provisions for severely punishing those who insult foreign heads of state or foreign diplomatic representatives. The general public is deeply concerned that the relationship between Italy and the League of Nations may become even more entangled as a result of this incident. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Dignity of a Head of State Insulted; Chairman of the Assembly Apologizes to the Emperor of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman of the League of Nations Assembly, Janson, recently sent a letter to the Emperor of Abyssinia in the name of the League of Nations, expressing his sincere apologies for the incident that occurred yesterday afternoon at the Assembly. When the Assembly continues to meet this morning, Janson will also publicly apologize to the Emperor of Abyssinia. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>International Association of Journalists Expresses Sincere Apologies to His Majesty the Emperor of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Association of Journalists stationed in Geneva recently held a special meeting and passed a motion stating, "The incident created by Italian journalists at the League of Nations Assembly today is the first of its kind since the establishment of the League of Nations. This association deeply regrets the actions of the journalists and has decided to condemn them. It also expresses sincere apologies to His Majesty the Emperor of Abyssinia and the Chairman of the League of Nations Assembly on behalf of the journalists of all countries." Finally, it stated that none of the journalists who caused the incident are members of this association, which is a source of comfort to the association. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Clearly Directed Directly by Rome</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Eight Italian newspaper reporters were arrested and spent the night in jail for staging a demonstration to obstruct the King of Abyssinia when he addressed the League of Nations Assembly last night. As of today, there has been no news on how these eight people will be dealt with, but their admission certificates have been confiscated, and they will no longer be able to attend any League of Nations meetings. According to Swiss law, these individuals must be severely punished or imprisoned for the crime of insulting foreign special representatives. This case will only be prosecuted after the Swiss Federal Executive Council makes a decision, but it does not appear that the Council will meet anytime soon. These eight people may be deported. It is widely believed that this demonstration against the King of Abyssinia was clearly directed directly by the authorities in Rome, and some people are now speculating that this action is a sign that Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations.

<h3>Italian Propaganda Chief Sends a Telegram of Condolence</h3>
<p>(Rome) Propaganda Minister Alfieri recently sent a telegram of condolence to the Italian journalists arrested in Geneva, saying, "The institution of slavery prevails in Abyssinia. Italy infused that country with its civilization of a thousand years, which has resulted in offense and attack. Your inability to suppress your righteous indignation has led to your imprisonment. I express my respect and sympathy to all of you in my personal capacity. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Rome) After eight Italian journalists were arrested and imprisoned for staging a demonstration at the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva yesterday, the newspapers here have defended them, saying that the speech delivered by the Emperor of Abyssinia was provocative. " Among them, the semi-official Agenzia Stefani reported that a person who has failed on the battlefield could be respected, but if a king like the Emperor of Abyssinia abandons his people and flees abroad with his wealth when his country is in danger, this is the act of a coward and should not be respected.

<h3>French Newspapers Unanimously Condemn as Foul Play</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, have harshly condemned the actions of the Italian journalists who caused trouble at the League of Nations Assembly yesterday. "L'Écho de Paris" called it "unprecedented foul play." Famous journalist Saint-Brice wrote in "Le Journal" that "if this kind of demonstration is tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?" "Le Petit Parisien" published an article by famous journalist Loubert, stating that "this incident is incredible," and that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu was furious at the time and loudly rebuked the Italian journalists, saying, "This behavior is extremely barbaric. You should restrain yourselves immediately." The "L'Œuvre" newspaper published an article by Madame Tabouis, stating, "The chaos on the streets after yesterday's incident is indescribable. It is understandable to have heckling and insults against the victorious country in the gallery of the League of Nations Assembly, which can be excused, but now there are those who heckle and insult the head of a defeated country on the orders of the government, which has made the representatives of all countries filled with righteous indignation. According to general observations, this matter will not end here. Mussolini may retaliate by temporarily withdrawing from the League of Nations." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Situation in the Mediterranean; Italy Demands Equal Rights; Prepares to Negotiate with Britain</h3>
<p>(Rome) It was learned today that Prime Minister Mussolini advocates absolute equality regarding the situation in the Mediterranean and may personally negotiate with Britain to resolve the Mediterranean issue between the two countries. The first important step will be to approve Italy's dispatch of representatives to hold a meeting with the Italian side. However, before participating in the meeting, Italy will likely demand that Britain immediately withdraw its fleet stationed in the Mediterranean and lift the mutual support agreements signed by Britain and various Mediterranean countries during the Italian-Abyssinian war, as well as allow Italian warships to pass freely through the Turkish Dardanelles. If Italy is satisfied with the above two points, then it may also agree to stop fortifying ports in East Africa and opening naval bases, and may even withdraw some of its troops from Libya.

<h3>Principle of Not Recognizing Land Seized by Force; United States Resolves to Maintain It; Phillips Appointed Ambassador to Italy to Promote Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today appointed Under Secretary of State Phillips as the successor to Long as Ambassador to Italy. Long had resigned due to illness, which had been approved by President Roosevelt. Phillips's task in the future is to promote relations between the United States and Italy, while not abandoning the government's principle of not recognizing land seized by force. It is to be noted that although Prime Minister Mussolini appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich as Ambassador to the United States last week, the United States is also appointing an Under Secretary of State as Ambassador to Italy, which shows the importance attached to the Abyssinian issue in both Rome and Washington. President Roosevelt recently revoked the ban on arms shipments to Italy. Phillips will seek to maintain diplomatic relations with Abyssinia under Italian rule. It is to be noted that the United States Minister to Abyssinia, Engert, and the embassy staff are still stationed in the capital of Abyssinia, but the government in its place of residence has been extinguished. If these embassy personnel enter into relations with Italy, it would be tantamount to recognizing Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia. This move will raise the question of whether to recognize Japan's occupation of Manchuria. It is now heard that Assistant Secretary of State Welles is expected to succeed Phillips as Under Secretary of State. (Guomin Dian, 30th)</p>

<h3>The Arrow Is on the String; Austria Brewing Restoration; Great Concern That the Little Entente Will Go to Extremes; Anxiety Expressed in London Political Circles</h3>
<p>(London) According to various sources, the issue of the restoration of the former imperial family in Austria is in a state where the arrow is on the string and must be fired. The fact that French Foreign Minister Delbos invited Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg to Geneva to discuss this matter proves that there is a reason for this. Political figures are extremely anxious about this news, believing that Schuschnigg's refusal to go to Geneva is clear evidence that the restoration of the Austrian former imperial family will soon take place. The countries of the Little Entente have repeatedly stated that once the Austrian restoration is realized, the armies of those countries will be mobilized immediately, which will result in German intervention. Therefore, Britain must prevent the Austrian restoration on the one hand, while gently advising the countries of the Little Entente not to go to extremes. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) When French Foreign Minister Delbos met with the Austrian representative to the League of Nations, Pflügl, in Geneva yesterday, he asked him to ask Chancellor Schuschnigg to go to Geneva in person to attend the special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly. According to well-informed sources here, the Chancellor plans to attend the meeting in Geneva when the regular meeting of the League of Nations Assembly is held in September and to meet with French Foreign Minister Delbos. However, at present, he does not intend to make this trip because the Austrian Parliament is about to meet. As for Austrian policy, it will remain the same, and there will be no changes internally or externally before the League of Nations Assembly meets in September. (Havas, 30th)</p>

Funds that have already been allocated are being used for relief. (30th, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Southwest Representatives Active in Tianjin; Situation in North China Temporarily Unchanged; The "Outer Six" Issue Currently at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Liu Zhe and Wang Shijiu, left Tianjin for Ping by special train on the 29th at 5:00 PM. According to Song, "I do not plan to go out recently after returning to Ping. The timing of inspecting various counties in Hebei and Chahar provinces is not yet determined. If I have time, I plan to go to Baoding. I will not come to Tianjin again in the short term. Regarding diplomatic issues, there was no formal contact during my days in Tianjin, which is practically equivalent to a standstill. The claim that Han Xiangfang will come north is unfounded. Most of the rumors about foreign affairs are irrelevant speculation." Since Song came to Tianjin before the Dragon Boat Festival according to the lunar calendar, he met with Lu and Han once in Botou Town. There is much speculation here about the overall situation in North China. Some say that when all else fails, the authorities will link up with several provinces, declaring the purpose of protecting the territory and ensuring the people's safety. Formally, they will not break away from the Central Government, but will only establish a Hebei-Shandong-Chahar-Suiyuan four-province national defense security building, led by Han or Song, as a shield against the difficult diplomatic situation. Although the outline has been discussed, this path will not be taken unless it is a last resort. During this period of severe national crisis, no matter what, they will never take actions that turn the guns inward. The Japanese side seems more eager than before for the North China regime to become clear, and it has restrained generally frustrated ambitious people within the Japanese concessions from acting arbitrarily. The Tianjin Consulate-General has even cracked down on undesirable rogues, deporting them back to their home country in batches of over twenty people on the 29th to show goodwill. However, the authorities have not yet shown any intention of launching, which is quite frustrating. Therefore, the roles within the Japanese concession waiting to be used are still gathering backstage, quietly waiting for news.</p>
<p>Southwest representatives Pan Yizhi, Wang Jiwen, and Huang Jianping have been active in Tianjin for many days. Taking advantage of Song's presence in Tianjin, they have been constantly meeting with him, aiming to realize the new situation in North China as soon as possible. Chen Zhongfu has returned to China from Japan and will arrive in Tianjin in about three days. At that time, the key figures from the Southwest in North China will accompany him to Ping, and will still use Chen as a stepping stone to actively urge the authorities. In order to promote the realization of the new situation in North China, Pan, Wang, and Huang do not plan to return south in the short term. To facilitate their work, they plan to establish a representative office in Pingjin, and may hold a press conference within a few days to promote the reasons for the northward advance of the Guangdong-Guangxi armies.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the speed of realization of the new situation in North China, and whether it can be eliminated or crushed, depends on whether the Southwest has the heart to rein in at the last moment and turn hostility into friendship. Whether the new regime will be produced according to the proposed outline depends on the actions of Lu and Han. The two leaders of Hebei and Chahar have never lagged behind others in their love for the country, and they are particularly eager for peace. If there is a glimmer of hope in the diplomatic environment, they will not take actions that would be criticized by the people and violate normalcy. Recently, because the two authorities are in a critical situation, they have maintained calmness, causing those who spread rumors to despair. Although the hearts of the people in Pingjin are still inevitably fluctuating, they already believe that the authorities have a firm grasp on maintaining local security. (29th)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Province Implements Food Control; Officials and Merchants Jointly Organize Food Management Committee; Grain Storage Registered and Sales Restricted</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After Guangxi Province promulgated foreign exchange controls, it has recently issued restrictions on the export of rice and grain in order to maintain the food supply as the situation becomes increasingly tense. Exports are only allowed after 2.4 million catties of white rice have been prepared to maintain military rations. Afterwards, the provincial government felt that the method of restricting rice and grain exports was still not perfect, so it established a food management committee to cope with the extraordinary period and required all grain storage warehouses in the province to be registered in order to provide for the people's food. After receiving the order, the Yongning County Government and the Provincial Public Security Bureau immediately worked with various agencies and organizations to jointly organize a food management committee and formulated provisional measures for managing food as follows: 1. Organize a temporary food management committee, jointly organized by the Yongning County Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Nanning Chamber of Commerce. 2. Food management is temporarily limited to grain and rice. 3. Investigate and register grain and rice stored by households in the county. The urban area is the responsibility of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and each district and township is the responsibility of the county government. 4. When necessary, the sale of grain and rice that has been investigated and registered may be restricted. 5. The registration of grain and rice adopts the method of reporting. During the investigation, each household shall report on its own. If there is any underreporting or concealment, once discovered or reported, in addition to the registered grain, the remainder shall be confiscated. The informant may be awarded half of the value of the confiscated portion. After registration, the value of the grain sold and transported by each household must be in accordance with the price assessed by the evaluation committee. 7. The registered grain and rice may be collected at any time as needed. 8. Specify several locations for the collection of grain, to which each household shall transport it, and then the committee will send personnel to transport it back. 9. The collected grain shall be paid in cash according to the assessed price, but transport and handling fees and consumption shall be included in the statistics. 10. First, designate Huashang stores in Nanning and Tingzixu to sell on consignment, and each store shall be given a handling fee of 1%. 11. The committee shall borrow several thousand yuan from the bank to purchase grain. 12. Control the Nanning rice mills, and the measures shall be determined separately. 13. If the committee incurs losses in the procurement of grain, it may request the provincial government to write off the amount and allow it to be exempted from repayment. 14. If there are any matters not covered by these measures, the committee shall submit them to the provincial government for approval to amend them at any time. 15. These measures shall be submitted to the provincial government for approval before implementation. (June 26th)</p>
<h3>Adjusting National Taxes; Henan Tax Bureau Established; Hubei Province Sets Up Three Management Offices and Twelve Branch Offices; Unified Collection of Tobacco and Alcohol, Mining, and Unified Taxes</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance's various unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral taxes, which are under the jurisdiction of the Tax Administration, have been set up separately with separate agencies for collection. The organizations are very fragmented, and the command is not uniform, resulting in insufficient inspection and easy corruption. After repeated and thorough rectification, there has been no significant progress. Without fundamental reform, it is difficult to achieve a thorough reorganization. Therefore, it is proposed to unify all provincial tax agencies and reform the measures for local tobacco and alcohol taxes. Five provinces, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan, will begin implementation from the 25th year of the Republic, and Hunan and Jiangxi will be designated as one district, Hubei and Henan as one district, and Sichuan as one district. In addition to the Unified Tax Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Shandong-Henan District being changed to the Shandong District Unified Tax Bureau, the original agencies for various unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral taxes within the borders of the Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Sichuan provinces under the jurisdiction of each district shall be abolished and reorganized separately. Each district shall establish a district tax bureau to specialize in supervising collection matters and, depending on the circumstances, divide the five provinces into regions to establish district tax management offices and tax branch offices to specialize in inspection and collection matters. The candidates for bureau chiefs have already been announced by the ministry. The newly appointed chief of the Hubei-Henan District Tax Bureau, Jing Youyan, arrived in Hankou from Beijing the day before yesterday and is scheduled to organize and establish the bureau at the original site of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Bureau on July 1st. In addition to the previous three sections, an accounting section will be added, totaling four sections. In addition, there will be several plant, field, and mine officers, as well as four to six inspectors. All of these personnel are appointed by the ministry. In Hubei Province, three management offices and twelve branch offices will be established separately. The head of the Northern Hubei Management Office is Yang Duo, the former deputy director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, stationed in Laohekou. The head of the Eastern Hubei Management Office is Qu Chengda, the director of the Henan Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, stationed in Hankou. The head of the Western Hubei Management Office is Gui, the former special commissioner of the Hubei Mining Tax Office, stationed in Yichang. The ministry order for the twelve branch offices under the management office will be fully announced soon. As for the original tobacco and alcohol district bureaus and the inspection offices in each county, they will all be abolished. However, before the newly appointed personnel in each county arrive, the original district bureau chiefs and the directors of each inspection office will temporarily be responsible for maintaining order. (June 30th)</p>
<h3>Notorious Local Despot in Eastern Anhui, Zhang Daguan, Executed by Firing Squad; Provincial Government Ordered to Arrest and Handle</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Zhang Daguan, a well-known local despot in Dongliu County, was recently captured and escorted to the provincial capital by a team dispatched by the Anqing Garrison Headquarters under the order of the provincial government, where he was executed by firing squad. The details of the case are as follows: Zhang Daguan, 44 years old, resides in Zhangjia Village in Dongliu County. He has been running rampant in the countryside, controlling everything, and exploiting people with heavy interest rates, accumulating wealth of hundreds of thousands. Moreover, relying on his power and influence, he has purchased or seized farmland, almost two-thirds of the county. Many county magistrates have not dared to offend him slightly. In the past, the provincial government had ordered his arrest, but Zhang always heard the news in advance and escaped without being caught. Two years ago, Zhang also founded Daguan Middle School at the Dadu River ferry crossing in Anqing, using it to control the county's education, which deepened public resentment. Complaints piled up like mountains. Recently, Provincial Chairman Liu Zhenhua, under the electric order of the Military Affairs Commission, ordered the arrest of the Zhang, so he secretly ordered the Anqing Garrison Headquarters to send personnel to lead a team to Zhangjia Village in the early morning of the 26th. When they searched Zhang's inner room, because they had heard in advance that there were traps in the room, they threw a hand grenade into the room to bomb it first. At that time, Zhang was in another room upstairs, playing yezi with people. Hearing the sound of the hand grenade, he knew something was wrong, so he climbed up and hid in the ceiling. After the arresting troops searched repeatedly, he was finally caught. At the same time, Zhang's henchmen in the house dared to open fire to resist arrest. When escorted to Zhongyuan, many of his henchmen also armed themselves to try to rescue him, injuring a soldier on the spot. Fortunately, he did not escape. When passing the Dadu River Army Hospital, the soldiers were about to take Zhang in for a rest. Because Zhang was captured in a hurry, he was only wearing pants and slippers. After his family sent clothes and hats for him to wear, Zhang still made bold statements to comfort his family. He was then escorted to the province by Minsheng steamship. After a strict interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters, he was presented to the provincial government and, at about 8:00 PM on the 27th, a team was dispatched to tie Zhang to the execution ground outside Xiaodongmen and execute him by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: County Magistrate Concurrently Serves as Security Team Leader</h3>
<p>In this province, each security brigade has been headed by the county magistrate, with a major brigade adjutant appointed by the security commander. Since the reform on March 1st, the county magistrate no longer needs to serve concurrently as the brigade leader, and the major brigade adjutant is changed to be the brigade leader. After three months of implementation, the provincial government believes that the security system improvement plan needs to suspend the part about the county magistrate no longer serving concurrently as the brigade leader. For the sake of unified authority and convenient command, the provincial order stipulates that from July 1st, the county magistrate will still serve concurrently as the brigade leader, and the original major brigade leader will revert to the old system and become the brigade adjutant. After receiving the order, the Twelfth Brigade stationed in this county completed the handover at 9:00 AM on the 1st, and County Magistrate Li Leng, who concurrently serves as the brigade leader, immediately took office and convened all officers above platoon leader level to gather in the hall to hold an inauguration ceremony and give a speech. At the same time, a public notice was issued. It is said that the team has recently received a provincial order that two companies of the Ninth Brigade stationed in Kunshan will be transferred under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Sow Gives Birth to White Elephant</h3>
<p>Zhou Afu, a farmer in Changdengwan, Hengtang Township, outside the Xu Gate, Suzhou, raised a sow that gave birth to fourteen piglets and two small white elephants in succession the other day, causing a sensation in the vicinity. However, because they were not well cared for, the two small white elephants died soon after.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Public Security Bureau Captures and Kills Stray Dogs</h3>
<p>The Wu'yi Public Security Bureau, believing that it is summer and the city is full of stray dogs, which is enough to hinder sanitation and the appearance of the city, specially ordered the bureau and the First Public Security Branch to send police to capture them at the same time. Eight stray dogs were captured on the 29th and immediately electrocuted to death. More than ten were captured on the 30th and all were electrocuted at any time and moved to the suburbs for burial.</p>
<h3>Merger of Field Tax Collection Offices</h3>
<p>The Wu'yi County Government has always set up east and west counters for the collection of field tax. The reason for the division of the east and west districts began in the Qing Dynasty when there were Wujin and Yanghu counties, so the collection was divided by district, which has not changed until now. Now, the county government has received an order from the Finance Department that from July 1st of this year, the names of the east and west district field tax collection offices will be canceled and merged into the Wujin County Field Tax Collection Office, in line with other counties. After the county magistrate received the order, he announced the merger on the 30th and appointed Wei Guojun as the director and Mao Feiran as the deputy director. The method of collecting field tax, which has been in place for decades, has been reformed at once, and the collection will undoubtedly be more convenient.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: 120,000 Autumn Seeds Determined</h3>
<p>This spring, the silkworm business was successful due to suitable weather and effective feeding, with excellent results. The total number of fresh cocoons produced in the county was approximately 200,000 dan, equivalent to more than 74,000 dan of dried cocoons, an increase of one-half compared to last year. This autumn, the actual required quantity in the county is approximately 200,000 sheets. The model district has ordered 140,000 sheets from various farms, but as of yesterday, the quantity determined has reached 120,000 sheets, which shows that the sericulturists in the villages are increasingly interested in sericulture. This is also good news for the future of sericulture. In addition, the silkworm model district has already started registering autumn cocoon merchants. Moreover, all silk factories in the county started operating in the past month, which has invigorated the market in various industries.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit the Capture and Killing of Field Frogs</h3>
<p>Jiang Yi, a citizen of the Fifth District, believes that field frogs eat insects that damage rice, which is beneficial to crops, as everyone knows. Our country is based on agriculture, so the capture and killing of field frogs has been prohibited and protected by generations. However, over time, the prohibition has become ignored, with people killing them anyway. Common villagers and fishermen in Wujiang still capture field frogs in the villages, skin them, and sell their meat in the village markets as a dish or a snack to have with wine. When they are killed, the cruelty is unbearable to witness. Now that it is time for planting rice seedlings, how can we continue to slaughter them? Therefore, he submitted a request to the county government to strictly investigate and prohibit it. After receiving the report, the county magistrate believed that capturing and killing frogs not only affects agriculture but also violates the principles of benevolence. The government should have long prohibited it, and the people should abide by it. Fearing that over time, the prohibition will be ignored again, he specially reiterated the ban yesterday, issuing a notice to the villagers to be aware of it together. Violators will be severely punished.</p>

Although the station buildings at each station have been completed, the platforms and external flags have not yet been arranged. It is said that the opening date will be postponed to July 15th, with four passenger cars running between Suzhou and Jiaxing each day.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Collection of Banquet Donations Begins</h3>
<p>The county government, in order to increase funding for compulsory elementary schools, presented a request to the financial and educational departments and determined that from the 1st of this month, it would begin collecting banquet donations. The collection rate is 5% of the value. If the total value is less than two legal tender yuan, it should be exempted. If customers resist the donation, they are allowed to immediately forward the case to the county for review. Five days ago, all taverns and catering businesses were required to register with the local donation collection office.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Dispute Over Jurisdiction of Shengsi Islands</h3>

This time, the commissioners of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces met for investigation without any results. Commissioner Ge returned to Tong on the 30th and reported to the provincial government, which will be decided by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Jiangbei Traitors Very Active</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei counties are full of traitors, engaging in secret activities. Recently, many strangers have been living in scattered locations in this county, with very secretive movements. After receiving the report, the county government ordered various military and police agencies to strictly prevent them and closely monitor their actions at all times.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Two Bandits Arrested While Touring Ling Bridge</h3>
<p>Xu Arong and Shan Yanling, two bandits who made a living by robbing villages in Zhenhai and Fengxian, heard that Ling Bridge had been rebuilt and completed on the evening of the 28th and came to visit together. While wandering on the bridge, they were discovered by the Ningbo Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team. Team member Wu Zhenyuan led investigators to the bridge and arrested the two bandits, who confessed that their accomplice Tang Jichang was hiding in Tianfu Lane on the Jiangbei shore of this port. The investigators also went to the address and arrested him, and all were sent to the headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Tiger Cholera in Cixi</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the hot weather in various parts of Cixi County, tiger cholera has occurred as expected. In recent days, more than ten people have died from infection. On the morning of the 29th, A-San, a melon seller in the city, and a vegetable vendor, Mr. Li, still carried their burdens into the market early in the morning. Suddenly, they suffered from severe abdominal pain and died within two hours. In addition, the wife of a farmer, Mr. Zhao, in Jinhu Township, and Mr. Li and others near Zhangting Township, all suffered from abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, and died within a few hours. The government authorities are now taking measures to prevent and control the disease, and the hospitals are doing their best to promote free vaccinations.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Yu Gong Society (Special Dispatch from Beiping)</h3>
<p>Recently, I have often seen news about the Yu Gong Society and articles discussing its research achievements in Japanese publications. In Chinese publications, apart from Rong Geng's article about the Archaeological Society in the first issue of Volume 33 of the Oriental Magazine this January, which mentioned it in passing, there is not much else. It can be seen from this example that our people do not know as much or as clearly about ourselves as the Japanese do. Given the society's lofty ambitions, in-depth research, and the breadth of its activities in academic circles in our country today, our people cannot but place great hope and pay great attention to it. The reporter has made every effort to collect information about the society from various sources and has briefly recorded it to inform the people of our country. At a time when the old capital is almost on the verge of being lost and what we see and hear is all bleak, this may give our people a little excitement and dispel the feeling of despair and resignation.</p>
<p>(1) Research Work</p>
<p>The society was established during the serious national crisis two years ago, and for more than two years, it has been struggling in the face of the increasingly serious national crisis. If we trace back to the source, the origin of the society was also due to the stimulation of the serious national crisis. Therefore, the greatest goal of the society is to devote itself to the work of saving the country from the standpoint of the academic community. This is what the society said in its fundraising announcement, in the item on establishing the purpose: "There are countless ways to save the country, but focusing on geography, understanding the connotation of the nation and the country, and then seeking ways to transform and compete with other countries in the world is one of the main aspects."</p>
<p>Under the goal of saving the country, the means adopted by the society is to study geography, but its research method is different from that of those who study geography for the sake of geography. In a nutshell, the method it uses can be called a comprehensive method. To analyze it further, (1) in terms of breadth, it includes all kinds of phenomena such as ethnicity, transportation, culture, politics, and economy; (2) in terms of depth, it traces back to ancient times and up to the present, and all kinds of evolution, migration, mixing, and differentiation are included in the research object. This is also what the society said in its fundraising announcement: "The purpose is to study the historical geography and to carry out field investigations in order to understand the traces of our Chinese nation from divergence to unification, to understand the strategies of our Chinese nation to open up and dominate the East Asian land, to understand the spirit of our Chinese nation's arduous struggle to preserve its common surname, to lay a solid foundation for our nationalism, and to generate the power of fusion and unity among the people of our country. This is the great task of today, which we dare not shirk because of our weak ability." To put it more clearly, the society's research on geography is not to study the simple land itself, but its main focus is to regard this land as the stage for various activities of the nation, and then to study it. If we try to study the eight major guidelines of the society's research plan, its significance will be clearer. These so-called eight major guidelines are: (1) compiling a history of the Chinese nation, (2) compiling a history of Chinese geographical evolution, (3) compiling a map of Chinese geographical evolution, (4) verifying and supplementing the geographical records of the official histories of past dynasties, (5) compiling a bibliography of Chinese geographical books, (6) compiling a dictionary of Chinese place names, (7) recording and compiling a collection of historical materials on local culture in China, and (8) compiling a unified gazetteer of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Since the society was established in Beiping in February of the 23rd year of the Republic, up to now, its research work has been carried out in the following ways:</p>
<p>The first is the publication of the Yu Gong Bi-monthly. The publication is published 24 times a year, with twelve issues per volume, so it has now reached Volume 5, Issue 8. In terms of binding, each issue originally had 30 pages, but it has been greatly expanded since Volume 4, with each issue reaching 80 to 90 pages. The cover has also been changed to thick Daolin paper, printed in color (which feels very generous and simple). The layout method consists of three columns: one for essays, one for news from the domestic geographical community, and the other for a collection of communications. Among these three columns, the news from the domestic geographical community is a special collection of valuable statistics and records on geography in China, as well as the opinions and recent developments of researchers in this field. However, the most important column is still the first column, which publishes about ten essays in each issue, all of which are excellent works. Up to the third volume, according to statistics, a total of 242 essays have been published in 36 issues, of which 77 are about ancient geography, 27 from the Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, 20 from the Three Kingdoms period to the Tang Dynasty, 9 from the Song Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, 23 from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, 24 about border areas, 5 about inland ethnic groups, 13 about Sino-foreign transportation, 11 about local gazetteer research, 7 about local news, 12 about map reviews, 9 about travelogues, 24 about book reviews, catalogs, and biographies, and 10 about general discussions and miscellaneous topics. What has been published in Volume 4 and the first part of Volume 5 is not included. In terms of the status of the publication in the field of domestic geographical publications, it can be said to be one of the best.</p>
<p>The second work that the society has carried out and achieved results is the drawing of maps. In this regard, it has been going on for four or five years from the 22nd year of the Republic to the present. The maps it has drawn can be roughly divided into two types: one is modern maps, and the other is historical evolution maps. Among these two types, in addition to the more than 40 historical evolution maps that have been completed, about four-fifths of the modern maps have also been completed, costing a total of 4,000 yuan. Another 1,000 yuan is needed to complete the project. This sum of money was also raised privately by Gu Jiegang and Zheng Dekun. In addition, Hong Weilian edited and printed a special issue of the Matteo Ricci Map, which has been published for many days and is a grand and spectacular event in the academic world this year.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two tasks, the society is also eager to carry out the following three things: (1) publishing specialized books. The significance of this work lies in publishing the specialized research achievements of scholars. The society has now accumulated more than ten kinds of manuscripts, all of which are carefully structured works, such as Wang Riwei's "History of the Hui People in China," Feng Jiasheng's "Historical Geography of the Northeast," "History of the Western Liao," and Tan Qixiang's "History of the Migration of Inland People in China," etc. However, it is estimated that the cost of printing, if one or two kinds are published on average every month, will require 6,000 yuan a year, which is a huge amount of money that cannot be raised at once, resulting in good works not being published as soon as possible, which is a pity. (2) Conducting group research work, hiring specialists, dividing labor for research, and compiling catalogs, so that future researchers can save infinite time and energy. (3) Determining special topics and organizing a tour group once or twice a year to conduct field investigations and inspections. (It is rumored that this year's summer vacation, it is planned to organize such a tour group to Wuyuan, Baotou and other places to inspect the irrigation ditches, and Wang Leyu, the son of Wang Tongchun, who led the development of the Hetao area for 60 years, has also sent a letter to the society, inviting it to go and is willing to be a guide.) However, it is estimated that it will cost 6,000 yuan a year to carry out the second task, and another 5,000 yuan to carry out the third task. It is not yet known whether there is a way to raise the funds temporarily.</p>
<p>(2) Current Plan</p>
<p>The biggest of the society's current plans is to study the border areas. In this regard, the society has prepared a detailed plan, which is roughly divided into three points in terms of the progress of the work: (1) collecting materials and raising questions, (2) training investigation talents, and (3) encouraging border area research. It is reported that the society has divided the questions that should be studied in the border areas of the country into eleven themes, namely (1) Manchuria, (2) Mongolia, (3) Xinjiang, (4) Qinghai, (5) Tibet, (6) Southwest ethnic groups, (7) Nanyang, (8) coastal defense, (9) areas near the Great Wall, (10) military reclamation, and (11) immigration. For each theme, the society has proposed a list of three to five people from among its members who are specialized in the field, with a total of 39 people on the list for the eleven themes, for the government to develop the border areas and for those who are interested in developing the border areas to refer to.</p>
<p>It is reported that the funds required for this border area research plan are estimated to be about 33,340 yuan in the first year. As for how to raise the funds, the situation is not yet known in detail.</p>
<p>The second plan of the society at present is to raise funds. It is said that it plans to raise 300,000 yuan within ten years. If the opportunity is favorable, it also plans to shorten the time limit. It is now planned to elect eight members and seven sponsoring members as members to organize the "Yu Gong Society Fundraising Committee" to be responsible for managing fundraising and payment matters.</p>
<p>Of the donations received, one-tenth will be used to purchase books, and the rest will be stored in the fund account. If the donor specifies the use, it can also not be included in the fund. All donors who donate more than 50 yuan or raise more than 500 yuan on their behalf will be invited by the society to be sponsoring members and will be engraved on gold and stone as a memorial. It is reported that since the start of fundraising, in addition to Zhang Guogan's generous donation of a property in Xiaohonglu Factory in Beiping, which is more than five acres in total with 20 rooms, other ordinary applicants have also been very enthusiastic. In recent years, the people of the country have gradually felt the value of in-depth specialized research, which can also be seen from this. In addition, it has been heard that there will be several special donations, but whether the future can be smooth is still unknown.</p>
<p>In short, the society has emerged in such a serious national crisis, with such lofty ambitions, and has recruited so many talents from all aspects. We feel infinitely concerned about its future and place great hopes on it. The Greek scientist Archimedes was able to remain calm when the Romans broke into the city and invaded his residence, holding a knife against him, and scolding the chaotic soldiers not to destroy his sand table for scientific experiments. Some people may laugh at his stupidity, but Archimedes had previously used his research to defeat the Roman siege, only to be defeated by the fact that one person's strength was not enough to support the whole situation. But Archimedes' spirit is admirable. We can view the emergence of the Yu Gong Society in such a way at a time when the country is so turbulent. We only hope that the society can use its group strength to make the greatest efforts in the work of saving the country.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, I have recently learned from Chen Weijing, a patrol officer from the 7th District Public Security Substation, that he has read the report in the local news column of the Shen Bao on June 20th about Chen Weijing, a patrol officer from the 7th District Public Security Substation in Funing County, solving a case of opium smuggling. The situation is roughly consistent, but the amount of opium does not match the facts. After investigation, the opium seized by our office this time was only more than 200 taels, which may be due to erroneous rumors. We should forward a letter requesting correction. Please ask your newspaper to correct it accordingly. Sincerely, Funing County Government Public Security Section, June 26th.</p>

<h3>All Banks Will Be Closed for Two Days Yesterday and Today</h3>
<p>To Handle the Mid-Year Financial Statements</p>
<p>Bank accounting is divided into the end of June and the end of December every year. This year's mid-year closing, the savings department started on the 20th of last month, the commercial department started on the 25th of last month, and other departments started on the day before yesterday.

For example, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Bank of Shanghai, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank all worked through the night. They have been closed for two days since yesterday, but they are still working internally as usual to rush to handle the mid-year financial statements. Starting tomorrow, the bank holiday will be over, and business will resume as usual. As for the mid-year profits of the various banks, it has been decided that the Bankers' Association will officially announce them, but although they have not been fully calculated, it is widely expected that the Central Bank will have the most, followed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and then the various commercial banks. In addition, the business policies of the various commercial banks will still be handled in the same way as before, and they will be particularly cautious about various loans, try their best to reduce credit loans, and try to expand investment in industry and agriculture.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Wharf Management Office Was Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Manager Tan and Others Were Sworn in, and Wu Yu Was Appointed by the Ministry of Communications to Supervise the Oath</p>
<p>In order to unify the management and command of warehouse and dock business, the state-owned China Merchants Bureau specially organized the Wharf Management Office. Tan Boying, Ruan Xingyi, and Sile were appointed by the Ministry as managers and assistant managers. It was officially established on July 1st and held a swearing-in ceremony at the auditorium of the China Merchants Bureau at 10:00 a.m. Cai Zengji, general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Wu Yu, the oath supervisor of the Ministry of Communications, Tan Boying, manager of the Wharf Management Office, assistant managers Ruan Xingyi and Bole, and more than 100 people including officials and guests from various circles attended.</p>
<p>Swearing-in After Chairman Cai, the ceremony began. First, Manager Tan Boying and assistant managers Ruan Xingyi and Bole each raised their right hands and read the oath under the supervision of Wu Yu, the representative of the Ministry of Communications. The oath said, "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 (kèzūn, respectfully abide by) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the party's principles, abide by the laws and regulations, and be loyal and diligent in my post. I will never waste a penny or misuse a person, and I will never engage in corruption or bribery. If I violate this oath, I am willing to be subject to the most severe punishment. This oath, July 1st, 25th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Wu's Speech After the swearing-in ceremony, the oath supervisor of the Ministry of Communications gave a speech, saying, "Brothers, today I am ordered to represent Minister Yu to participate in the establishment of the Wharf Management Office and the swearing-in ceremony of Manager Tan and assistant managers Ruan and Bo, which is a great honor. I dare not give a speech, but offer a few words of advice. The China Merchants Bureau is the largest shipping company in China. Since its establishment, all five essential elements that should be possessed - talent, business, ships, docks, and cargo warehouses - have been extremely complete. Ideally, with such equipment, there should be sufficient development. Why has it not made much progress despite repeated reforms since its establishment? There are many reasons for this, but the failure to reform the fundamental organization is the most important. This time, after Minister Yu took charge of the ministry, he reorganized the China Merchants Bureau and invited General Manager Cai and Deputy Managers Tan and Lao to take charge of the bureau. Since the three of them took office, in the shortest period of time, we have seen great rectification in terms of personnel, business, and ships, with great results. The establishment of the Wharf Management Office today is the origin of the rectification of the warehouse and dock matters. From today onwards, the warehouse and dock matters will be entrusted to Manager Tan and assistant managers Ruan and Bo to be responsible for the rectification with all their heart. Therefore, Manager Tan's responsibilities in the future will be particularly important. With the success and spirit of Manager Tan's past events, and with the joint efforts of Ruan and Bo and all colleagues, the business of the China Merchants Bureau will flourish, which can be expected, and is also what I most hope for."</p>
<p>Cai's Speech General Manager Cai then gave a speech, saying, "Distinguished guests, colleagues, today's establishment of the Wharf Management Office is part of the Ministry of Communications' determination to rectify the state-owned shipping industry. The success of the future is determined by the leadership of Manager Tan and assistant managers Ruan and Bo, so that the wharf can be completely rationalized and the previous malpractices can be eliminated. My minimum hopes are roughly the following: Maintain the original business, increase new business, and facilitate customers as much as possible. Although the Wharf Management Office and the Business Section are ostensibly two separate parts, they are actually one family. It is best to communicate without official documents to avoid detours. The service personnel of each cargo warehouse and dock should also assist the manager. If you have any opinions, you may state them as much as possible for selection. Because the主管 (zhǔguǎn, responsible) personnel have many affairs, they can only提纳挈领 (tínàqièlǐng, grasp the main points), and all affairs depend on the cooperation of colleagues at all levels. Otherwise, it will not be successful. As for the colleagues who have been serving in the bureau for many years and have rich experience, they should of course be retained as much as possible, because the experience of the old staff is the asset of the bureau. If they are changed without reason, the newcomers must go through considerable training, resulting in a great loss. However, in order to implement new policies and new spirits, we have to酌量 (zhuóliàng, carefully consider) the participation of newly employed people. I hope that all new and old colleagues can wholeheartedly assist the manager and work with peace of mind. According to the organizational regulations, I am in the position of supervision and command, and I will do my best to contribute to the manager. I hope that from the day of the establishment of the Wharf Management Office, it will be a new milestone for the bureau, which is what I deeply hope for."</p>
<p>Tan's Reply Manager Tan then gave a reply, saying, "Distinguished guests, colleagues, today I am grateful to Director Wu of the Ministry of Communications and General Manager for their earnest instructions. I and all the colleagues of the Management Office should fully accept and follow them. However, wharf management is a specialized subject, which I am not familiar with. In other words, I am doing the work of an insider as an outsider, and I am afraid that I will not be able to do it well. I would like to ask the Ministry of Communications and the General Manager not to expect too much or too fast, otherwise it will not be easy to hand in the paper. The general period should be adapted to local conditions and suitable for the environment. All affairs should be rationalized and in line with reality, and no empty talk should be indulged in. This is the main purpose of establishing the Wharf Management Office. As for the辦事 (bànshì, handling affairs) procedures and steps, we must strive for standardization, unification, and concentration. This is an important goal. My working principle is to uphold the principle of honesty and openness. In the future, I will continue to work hard with the same spirit that I have had in Shanghai for the past nine years. No matter what, I will discuss and handle it with absolute sincerity, and I will be completely focused on the business. I hope that all my colleagues in the office and in the warehouses will also treat each other frankly. I dare to report this first on the day of the establishment of the Wharf Management Office. As for the business to be carried out in the future, it should be determined according to the material strength, because it is useless to have only spirit without material help. As for the principle of employment, there are two points: Do not use useless people, and completely choose people for things, never choose things for people. I only ask that people and things, people and people are compatible. In addition, there is no prejudice. Among the old colleagues, there are many who have been serving in the bureau for many years and have rich experience, so they should of course be valued as much as possible. I can state this before Director Wu of the Ministry of Communications and General Manager and all colleagues, please work with peace of mind. Today I am grateful to Director Wu and General Manager for their instructions, thank you very much."</p>

<h3>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Exchange Subsidiary Coins Without Time Limit</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Has Informed All Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received letters from the Fruit and Native Products Industry Association and the Salted Fish Industry Association, requesting to forward a message to the banks issuing subsidiary coin notes, extending the exchange time, adding staff, exchanging as much legal tender as possible, and ordering all branches and offices to exchange or accept them in the same way. After the Chamber of Commerce sent letters, it has now received a reply from the Bank of China in Shanghai, stating that the bank has always exchanged subsidiary coin notes for legal tender within the business hours and has never limited it to one hour per day. The Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to inform them.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Safety Bureau: Circular Order to All Districts to Investigate and Seize Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Directing Police Officers to Pay Close Attention to Investigation and Seizure; Any Smuggled Goods Discovered Should Be Confiscated Immediately</p>
<p>Since the rampant smuggling of goods from North China, it has already deeply penetrated the areas along the Yangtze River ports. Shanghai, being an important port for both Chinese and foreigners, sees even more rampant smuggling activities than the inland areas. The Municipal Public Safety Bureau has recently received orders to issue a circular to all districts to assist in the investigation and seizure of smuggled goods, so as to curb smuggling activities. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Announcement: The Municipal Public Safety Bureau hereby issues two public announcements: Political Order No. 10: It is hereby announced that the following order has been received from the Municipal Government Order No. 18805, which states: It is hereby approved that the Ministry of Finance and Customs telegram states: It is hereby approved that the Ministry of Finance orders that measures be taken to award informants who help in the seizure of smuggled goods: (1) If Customs seizes smuggled goods based on information provided by an informant, the Customs shall, after handling the case, give 50% of the proceeds from the penalty to the informant. (2) If various government agencies, military police (including road police) seize smuggled goods and transfer them to Customs for handling, the Customs shall, after handling the case, give 50% of the proceeds from the penalty as an award.

(4) If Customs seizes smuggled goods and invites military police (including road police) to assist in the execution on the spot, 10% of the proceeds will be awarded to the assisting military police. The order is to make a public announcement so that people are fully informed. Therefore, all should be aware of the above. This announcement is hereby made. Political Order No. 11: It is hereby announced that the following order has been received from the Municipal Government Order No. 18806, which states: It is hereby approved that the Ministry of Finance telegram states: Customs' efforts to combat smuggling have often relied on informants. In addition, measures to encourage reporting have been added (the measures have been published in previous newspapers and will not be repeated here).

Therefore, this order is issued, and a public announcement is made so that all people are fully informed. Director: Cai Jingjun</p>
<p>Circular Order for Investigation and Seizure: Regarding the trafficking of smuggled goods, the Customs authorities have been working with the Railway Bureau to carry out investigations and seizures. However, those involved in the trafficking of smuggled goods employ various cunning schemes and disguises, making it difficult to avoid loopholes. Therefore, in order to completely prevent the influx of smuggled goods and assist the Customs in investigations and seizures, a circular has been issued to all branch bureaus and district offices, directing all police officers to pay close attention to investigations and seizures. If any smuggled goods are discovered or reported by informants, they should immediately proceed to investigate and seize the goods, and then the General Bureau will notify the Customs authorities for disposal.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Continues to Rent Two Giant Aircraft from Germany</h3>
<p>The First Aircraft Will Take Off from Berlin to Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation has leased two giant three-engine aircraft from the German Lufthansa, which are Junkers-type aircraft with many passenger seats, very comfortable, and with sophisticated and fast-moving parts. They were successively transported to be dispatched on the Shanghai-Shaanxi-Chengdu line. The business is very prosperous. Now, because the original aircraft are not enough to dispatch, the Eurasia Company has agreed with Lufthansa to continue to rent two more of the same type of giant aircraft. The Eurasia Company's special Xiao Jiahao and Lutz went to drive and fly to China. According to the telegram, the first aircraft is scheduled to take off from Berlin on the morning of the 3rd, passing through Turkey, across the Indian Ocean, through India, and on to Annan and Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai. The estimated schedule is about the 12th. The second aircraft will continue to fly, but the schedule has not been determined. It is also heard that the new hangar, factory, and office building of the company at Longhua Airport have been completed. Electrical lights are now being installed, and various machines will be installed soon, and the office will be moved in. The completion ceremony will be held at the same time as welcoming the giant aircraft to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Song-Han District Pilotage Fees: Full Collection from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Those with Contracts are Charged at a 10% Discount; Zhengji, Zhaoxing and Other Companies Have All Signed Contracts</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee of Song-Han District announced the pilotage fee rates, it caused disputes due to the opposition of shipping companies starting in September of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. It was not resolved until the end of June of last year. Shipping companies that signed pilotage contracts with the Song-Han District Office were uniformly charged at 65% of the fee rates, and those who did not sign contracts were charged at 75% of the fee rates. Now that the one-year period has expired at the end of June, the Song-Han District Office has decided to collect the full amount of fees starting from July 1st, without any discounts, because the pilotage fee rates have been discounted, resulting in significant losses and making it difficult to maintain operations. After repeated requests and consultations from shipping companies, it was decided that shipping companies that signed pilotage contracts with the Song-Han District Office would be uniformly charged at 90% of the fee rates, and those who did not sign contracts would be charged at 100% of the fee rates. Now, shipping companies such as Zhengji and Zhaoxing have all signed contracts, and the new rates have been implemented starting yesterday.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Food Supply is Secure</h3>
<p>More Than 200,000 Bags of Rice in Stock, Sufficient for One Month's Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Gu Xinyi, a leader in the grain industry, who provided the following detailed information: The Shanghai Food Committee previously resolved to purchase foreign rice to adjust the food supply, but later realized that it was not necessary and stopped the process. Currently, there are approximately 200,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, each bag weighing 150 catties, all piled up in various warehouses. This amount of rice is sufficient for the food needs of Shanghai for one month. In addition, rice boats from the inland arrive in Shanghai every day, meeting the supply and demand. At the same time, the rice-producing areas in southern Anhui and other places have abundant rice reserves. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of food in Shanghai at present. Early rice in the Yangtze River area is expected to be available by the end of August. Although there are still two months left, it is predicted that Shanghai will not experience a shortage of food at present, but there may be a slight shortage during the lean season in August, but it is not a major concern. Those who are currently ordering foreign rice have disappeared due to unfavorable prices. As for the rumors that a rice market similar to a fish market organization will be established, it is unlikely to materialize.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Summer Cocoons Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Zhejiang's Detained Cocoons Have Been Completely Released</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee detained shipments of silk merchants and Yuqian merchants who purchased spring cocoons at prices below the standard price, the Shanghai and Zhejiang silk factory associations repeatedly telegraphed requesting the release. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the silk factory industry that the Zhejiang detained cocoons have been completely released one after another after the cocoon merchants paid保证金 and pledged. The Silk Control Committee will then impose penalties after deciding on the punishment measures. In addition, summer cocoons from various places in Zhejiang, such as Haining and Chongde, have entered the market, and the cocoon houses in these places have also opened. However, the harvest has not been good due to the climate. Jiaxing and other places will also be on the market.</p>

<p>Letter to the Police Department:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, According to a letter from the Nantong Association, Mr. Ji Shilin, a fellow townsman, was shot and killed by Sun Qiwan, a detective in the French Concession Patrol Room, who falsely accused his brother Ji A'er of attempted murder, which led to his sentencing. Such a reversal of right and wrong, the wrongful killing of innocent people, and the reinstatement of grievances, please ask the French Concession authorities to uphold justice, strictly investigate the murderer, detective Sun Qiwan, and investigate the accomplices Chen Xiangrong and Wu Caoshi, who used usury to exploit them. According to this, the case concerns mutual accusations of murder, so the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Federation was immediately asked to investigate in detail to screen and verify the case. The standing committee member of the association, Ye Ruizhai, and Tong Lizhang, reported that the letter was received on June 25th. The public letter from your association stated that regarding the case of Ji Shilin, a Nantong native, being killed by Sun Qiwan, a detective in the French Patrol Room, at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road, the letters from various parties and various rumors have different opinions and are difficult to decide. The situation has been reported by nearby investigations. The officials, Ruizhai, and others went to Ji A'er's house at 24 Lanxin Lane, Bail Road, on June 27th at 4:00 PM, and asked the neighbors nearby. It was said that Ji Lao'er (also known as A Mao, nicknamed Xiao Chongming, 31 years old) borrowed eight yuan from Wu Caoshi, who lived at 8 Runde South Lane, Huanghe Road, in May of last year (every yuan of interest was 6 copper coins per day). A total of 48 copper coins were paid daily until November. Due to lack of ability to pay, it was not paid. Wu Caoshi discussed with the roommate Chen Xiangrong because he could not collect the money. Unexpectedly, Chen had a gap with Ji Lao'er and volunteered. Suddenly, on June 4th of this year, Ji Lao'er happened to meet Chen at his father-in-law's house at 4 Runde South Lane. At first, there were verbal disputes, followed by fights. As a result, Ji was scheduled to eat and talk about reason at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road at 2:00 PM on June 5th. Ji Lao'er's brother, Ji Shilin, was afraid that his brother would suffer losses, so the two of them went as agreed. When they arrived at the tea house, Wu Caoshi and others were already there. Then detective No. 76 of the French Patrol Room came up and asked who Xiao Chongming was (referring to Ji A'er). After the inquiry, he took out handcuffs and planned to handcuff Ji A'er. At this time, his brother Ji Shilin saw that the detective was detaining his brother for no reason, so he stepped forward to ask for reason. Ji A'er realized that the situation was not good, so he fled. As a result, the two brothers went downstairs together to escape. The detective saw Ji and others fleeing, so he followed them downstairs. On the stairs, he stumbled and fell, which angered him greatly. He fired a shot with his pistol, hitting Ji Shilin in the back and shooting out of his chest. The deceased ran to the front of the clothing store at 8 Gale Road and fell to his death. Ruizhai and others also asked who was holding the axe. It was said that he did not know. After Ruizhai and others finished their inquiries, they returned to the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road and asked the waiter about what happened. It was said that at about 2:00 PM that afternoon, Xiao Chongming and others came to the building for tea. Not long after, a detective came upstairs to ask about Xiao Chongming and handcuffed him. At that time, one person in the crowd took out an axe and slashed at the detective, but the detective avoided it. The axe fell to the ground and was picked up by the crowd. At one point, the crowd went downstairs to escape. The detective chased to the stairs, stumbled and fell. Then a gunshot was heard, and Ji Shilin died in front of 8 Gale Road. I don't know the rest. I hope you will check it out. This is addressed to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association. Investigators: Ye Ruizhai, Tong Lizhang. Now that the truth has been revealed, punishing the murderer according to law is the duty of the Police Department, and protecting the lives of citizens is even more its unshirkable responsibility. There are several points that our association cannot avoid saying: (1) Regardless of whether the shooting by Sun Qiwan was a legitimate defense, the first issue that must be clarified is whether Sun Qiwan received an order from your Police Department when he arrived at the Yihe Tea House on Huanghe Road. (2) Even if the citizen's resistance is true, the resistance was caused by Sun Qiwan's illegal handcuffing, and the responsibility for causing the conflict is very clear. (3) Taking a step back, if Sun Qiwan was acting on an order and the shooting was a formal act of performing his duties, why did the bullet enter from the back when Ji Shilin was fleeing? This is solid evidence. According to Ji Shilin, he did not commit robbery and did not apply the article of being shot dead while trying to escape. If it is said to be self-defense, the deceased should have a murder weapon, and the part of the body hit by the bullet should not be on the back. (4) Ji A'er's part is only a money debt dispute for failing to pay off usury (whether usury is a legitimate loan is reserved for discussion), and there is no evidence of committing a criminal offense. The responsibility for manufacturing the false evidence is very clear. (5) The Police Department believes that the conflict arose from a quarrel, and the conflict led to a murder case. Then all those who quarrel should be investigated. Why is one party guilty? This is unfair. The five points that your Police Department should pay special attention to are that it is clear that Sun Qiwan did not receive an order from his superiors when he arrived at the Yihe Tea House. He abused his power, opportunity, or method to take inappropriate actions, and his crime of dereliction of duty under Article 134 of the Criminal Law cannot be shirked. As for the murder part, Ji Shilin was intimidated by Sun Qiwan and tried to escape from illegal arrest. When he was fleeing, Sun Qiwan chased and fell, causing resentment, and then fired a gun to vent his anger. When Ji Shilin fell to the ground, he was still a weak person under coercion and did not have a murder weapon in his hand to resist. Sun Qiwan's murder out of anger was witnessed by the crowd present. If it is entrusted to be a fire of a pistol, what is the role of pulling out the gun? Especially after Ji Shilin was dead, Sun still frightened and suppressed him, and at that time he mistakenly thought that he had not hit the key point. His intention to commit intentional murder was very deep, and he committed the crime in the first paragraph of Article 271 of the Criminal Law, which is very clear. The rest are accomplices, and there is no doubt. In addition, Wu Caoshi is engaged in the business of usury (heavy interest loans, commonly known as usury), and constantly supports people in urgent need, obtaining heavy profits that are clearly inconsistent with the original cost with money, which has become the cause of the case. In Article 344 and Article 345 of the Criminal Law, penalties have already been stipulated. All incidents that are clearly defined by the law are overlooked by your Police Department, and instead, the weak Ji A'er is falsely accused of attempted murder. Where is justice? Where is the law? If Wu Caoshi, who is not engaged in the business of heavy profits, is transferred to the court for investigation, the lives of the citizens in the boundary will not be guaranteed at all. In case the situation expands, your Police Department will not be able to shirk its responsibility. In order to seek fairness in handling affairs and to preserve the prestige of the law, this association hopes to adopt justice and thoroughly investigate the case. In fact, this is a public friendship. This is addressed to the French Concession Police Department.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Adds Convenience Savings Deposits from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Divided into Lump-Sum Deposit and Withdrawal and Zero-Sum Deposit and Withdrawal; Branches in Various Provinces and Cities Have Also Handled Simultaneously</p>
<p>In order to facilitate citizens' deposits and withdrawals and develop business, the Bank of Communications specially applied to the Ministry of Finance to add two types of convenient savings deposits: lump-sum fixed deposit and zero-sum fixed deposit. All branches in various provinces and cities were notified in advance to start handling simultaneously from July 1. The interest rate is more favorable than current savings, and deposits and withdrawals are more convenient than fixed deposits. The Industrial News reporter interviewed the bank about the measures, and the following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Lump-Sum Fixed Deposit</p>
<p>For this deposit, a lump sum is deposited at one time, and the bank issues a deposit slip. Within the time limit, the depositor can still withdraw the principal and interest at any time. The deposit period is 20 months. The deposit amount must be more than 100 national currency yuan, and the maximum cannot exceed 20,000 yuan. The deposit interest rate is calculated at compound interest once every six months based on the actual number of months deposited. If it is deposited for two months to five months, the weekly interest rate is 4%. If it is deposited for six months to nine months, the weekly interest rate is 5%. If it is deposited for ten months to twelve months, the weekly interest rate is 5.75%. If it is deposited for thirteen months to eighteen months, the weekly interest rate is 6.35%. If it is deposited for nineteen months to twenty-four months, the weekly interest rate is 6.5%. If it is withdrawn within two months, no interest will be calculated. For the number of days exceeding two months, no interest will be calculated. After the 24-month period expires, if the deposit principal and interest are not withdrawn, the overdue interest will be calculated according to the current deposit interest rate calculation method. When withdrawing this deposit, the principal amount to be paid must be filled in on the back of the deposit slip, and the original seal must be signed and stamped and submitted to the bank for payment.</p>
<p>Zero-Sum Fixed Deposit</p>
<p>For this deposit, a deposit book is issued by the bank when it is deposited for the first time. From then on, deposits can be made successively regardless of the date. Within the time limit, the deposit can still be withdrawn once. The deposit period is 10 years. The minimum amount for this deposit is 5 yuan, and each subsequent payment cannot be less than 1 yuan. However, the total amount of deposited principal is at most 20,000 yuan. The interest is calculated according to the following interest rates based on the actual number of months deposited for each payment until the unified payment date. Compound interest is calculated once every six months. If it is deposited for one month to five months, the weekly interest rate is 4%. If it is deposited for six months to eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 5%. If it is deposited for one year to one year and eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 6%. If it is deposited for two years to two years and eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 6.5%. If it is deposited for three years to four years and eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 7%. If it is deposited for five years to six years and eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 7.5%. If it is deposited for seven years to eight years and eleven months, the weekly interest rate is 7.7%. If it is deposited for nine years to ten years, the weekly interest rate is 8%. For deposit interest, each payment is calculated to the month and year of withdrawal. If it is less than six months, no interest will be calculated. After the 10-year period expires, if the deposit principal and interest are not withdrawn, the overdue interest will be calculated according to the current deposit interest rate calculation method. When paying this deposit, an application form must be filled out with the original seal three days in advance, and the deposit book must be brought to the bank. After the bank signs and annotates the payment date in the original book, the payment will be made with the payment voucher filled in with the original seal at the time.</p>
<h3>Director of the Municipal Bureau of Finance Xu Fu Actively Rectifies Taxation</h3>
<p>Specially Appoints Hu Yizang as Design Committee Member</p>
<p>The municipal finance of this city is extremely complicated. Since the January 28th Incident, the revenue and expenditure have been reduced again. The central government considers Shanghai to be one of the world's five largest cities, and in order to plan for the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan, it has been selected several times, but no suitable person has been found. Then, Xu, the director of the Fujian Department of Finance, was known for his integrity and seriousness, so he was transferred to Shanghai to rectify the situation. Since Director Xu took office, he first actively eliminated long-standing abuses in terms of collection, in order to make every drop of public funds. Previously, officials who were ordinary in their conduct and found to have conclusive evidence, have been reported in five or six cases. At the same time, in order to understand the burden on the citizens, he advocated a no-tax increase policy. At the same time, he cleared up the arrears of past administrations one by one, so that all parties inside and outside the bureau presented a fresh image. Recently, in order to fundamentally innovate and make overall plans, Hu Yizang has been specially appointed as a member of the Finance Design Committee. It is said that Mr. Hu once served as the Director of the Land Tax Consolidation Office of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, the Director of the Danyang County Finance Bureau, and the Finance Inspector of Zhejiang. He has gained a lot of experience in financial management.</p>

<h3>Special District City Federation Petitions for Lower Party and National Flag Prices</h3>
<p>Current Sales Price is Unaffordable</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The First Special District City Federation of this city yesterday submitted a petition to the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, requesting the Shanghai Party and National Flag Production and Sales General Bureau to swiftly reduce sales prices to alleviate the burden and facilitate promotion. The original petition stated: "Petition regarding the swift reduction of sales prices by the Shanghai Party and National Flag Production and Sales General Bureau. We respectfully acknowledge the letters from sub-branches in the Third, Fourth, and Forty-sixth districts, stating: 'Respectfully, we write to inform you that several dozen of our members, including the 53 Bookstore, Renfengzhai, Yongxiang Silver Shop, and Wanshunchang, have jointly submitted letters stating that the government authorities, to plan for unified Party and National Flags, have specially permitted the Production and Sales General Bureau to have a monopoly. We, upholding patriotic aspirations, have no objections. However, the flag prices set by the Bureau are indeed double the price of those previously sold in the market. This not only disregards general purchasing power, but also diminishes the dignity of the Party and National Flag. We request your esteemed Federation to swiftly write to the Municipal Federation, and forward it to the Party and government organs, earnestly requesting that the current sales price be rectified and lowered. Otherwise, inviting merchant bidding would be fair and in accordance with public sentiment.' Upon investigation, our branches initially discovered that the Bureau's flag prices were too high and not in line with general commodity prices. Later, upon seeing the Bureau's reply to your esteemed Federation's letter, we learned the details. However, even based on that letter, there are several points that are self-contradictory, such as claiming that profit cannot compensate for research losses, and that flag production and sales have suffered setbacks and losses. We ask, how much research is needed to simply print and dye flags, not a great scientific invention? This is difficult for anyone to understand. If one wants to increase sales prices under the guise of setbacks and losses, it is even more illogical. Any undertaking inevitably involves considerable difficulties. In other words, research and setbacks are a necessary process for entrepreneurs. We cannot disregard public sentiment and material resources simply because of initial difficulties, and pass the burden onto the public. As for what is called 'existing facts,' we are still at a loss. It should be known that the Party and National Flag represents national dignity and is a matter of international concern. It is not an ordinary commodity that can be hoarded and monopolized. Yet the Bureau does not focus on this, but instead diligently tries to use all its power to force the public to comply. How can it not know that the public is starting to suspect and complain? Those who once loved the national flag now fear and avoid it. The impact on national sentiment cannot be estimated by ordinary figures. The Bureau also claims that the market price for a Size 6 flag was between two yuan forty cents and two yuan eighty cents, so the current price is 30% lower than the market price for pieced-together and faded flags. We do not know when this 'previous time' refers to. As far as we know, recently people were still buying the same size national flag from flag shops in the concessions for only ninety cents in legal currency, with better quality and color. The only difference is that one is printed in a single piece, and the other is sewn together by machine. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. In summary, it is clear that the price of the Party and National Flag should be affordable to the common people. We dare to submit this petition for your review, earnestly requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Interior. Considering the decline in people's livelihoods and weak purchasing power, please do not be overly coercive in promoting the Party and National Flag. The high price set by the Production and Sales Bureau must be thoroughly re-evaluated based on the environment and facts, and a balanced and appropriate price should be set. Otherwise, another round of merchant bidding should be held to eliminate malpractices and ensure fairness.' We have found that the points made are indeed insightful and are forwarding this to your esteemed Ministry for review and reduction to facilitate implementation. We eagerly await your response." Sincerely presented.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Enthusiastically Donates to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>All groups and sectors in this city are enthusiastically supporting the expansion of the national aviation rescue fund to purchase aircraft to present to the government and to commemorate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. It is learned that the Rickshaw Trade Association previously suggested that each rickshaw in the city donate five cents to be used for purchasing aircraft. They sent a letter entrusting the fund for purchasing commemorative aircraft to the Finance Bureau and the North-South Inspection Offices of the city to collect the money when issuing rickshaw licenses in June. Without a second thought, a total of 1,016 yuan and 60 cents in national currency was donated. The Finance Bureau transferred it to the committee yesterday. Also, the association received 200 yuan from the Securities Trade Association, 166 yuan from the Chinese Medicine College, 38 yuan and 70 cents from Zhaohe Middle School, 114 yuan from Chen Hongmou of Guangdong Primary and Secondary School, 10 yuan each from Lu Wenzhong and Xinzongxing Company, and 567 yuan and 60 cents from Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School, all of which have been received. The enthusiasm of all sectors for saving the nation and their love for their leader are evident.</p>
<h3>Directorate General of Posts Decides to Extend the Suspension of Sales of Old Version Stamps</h3>
<p>Extended by Six Months Until the End of the Year</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports: According to a Postal Bureau announcement, the date for suspending the sale of old version ordinary stamps (i.e., sailboat, harvest, farmer designs), airmail stamps, postage due stamps, and postcards, previously issued by the Postal Bureau, was originally set for the end of June this year.

It was previously a partnership, but now it is operated solely by Zhang Liehong from Nanjing. However, business is sluggish, and he struggled to maintain it. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM yesterday, he called for a car to move the goods from the store to another location. The employees also fled without a trace. When the Yimiao police learned about it, they sent police officers to investigate everything. Only an old steward, Fu Yutang, was guarding the store. The store was messy and disorganized. After searching, they found two large packages of account books that had not been taken away. The police officer suspected that there might be other problems, so he took Fu to the station for questioning. According to Fu, he was ordered by the store owner to guard the store. Now, the store owner has gone to a certain place in Nanjing, and the goods have also been taken to Nanjing. He did not know the rest. After the head of the police station verified the confession, he found that the removal of goods late at night was suspicious and there might be other problems.

Because they were fascinated by fantasy novels and swordplay stories, they wanted to go to famous mountains like Kunlun to learn flying sword techniques. They ran away last Sunday. The two parents searched everywhere without success and reported to the police station and the Public Security Bureau, and placed an advertisement in the newspaper. It turned out that the two children set out from Shanghai on foot and traveled to Huangdu Town, where Zhou's parents and a close friend intercepted them.

<p>Telegram Bureau's Crackdown on Radio Stations' Harmful Programs</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Increase Inspectors and Actively Manage</p>
<p>Since being ordered to manage radio stations, the Shanghai Telegram Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in handling the matter. It has actively engaged in sorting out radio frequencies, reviewing song lyrics and scripts, and investigating radio announcers. The bureau, from yesterday, has issued more specific regulations on the programs of Shanghai's private radio stations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Script Review In recent radio broadcasts, there are many obscene sentences and decadent sounds, which are detrimental to the normal habits of citizens. In view of this, the bureau reviewed the scripts and ruled the broadcasts. Since the review began until the end of May this year, more than 1,000 scripts have been reviewed. Although the Shanghai Broadcasting Industry Association requested a postponement, it came to an end at the end of June. As a result of the review, unqualified scripts were subject to considerable restrictions and bans.</p>
<p>Banning Programs The bureau has considerable standards for banning programs, namely (1) pure purpose, (2) not endangering security, (3) suitable for party principles, (4) not obscene, (5) not containing gods and monsters, (6) not violating scientific principles, (7) not violating logical spirit, (8) not containing dirty vulgarity, (9) not promoting feudal thought. The above nine items are the basis for the bureau's proposed improvement of social habits, promotion of social education, and increase of scientific intelligence. Those who deliberately violate them will be banned. It is heard that Siming Wuxi (i.e., Ningbo opera) has been absolutely banned from broadcasting.</p>
<p>Time Limit As a result of this review, many programs were considered unqualified, but the bureau gave time limits to those with lighter circumstances as a necessary step in improving the broadcasting industry. Those subject to restrictions include Shanghai Opera, Comedic Su Opera, Siming Documents, Siming Southern Lyrics, Minor Songs, Qing Songs, Huai Opera, and various sects of Xuanjuan. All of the above programs, including records, cannot be broadcast by each radio station for more than three hours per day, and cannot be broadcast during the time between 7:30 PM and 10:00 PM every day, which is the citizens' leisure time.</p>
<p>Increase Staff The bureau reviewed the scripts, but there are still discrepancies between the scripts and the lyrics. Therefore, even if the scripts are reviewed, whether the broadcasters are consistent in their words and deeds is questionable. Therefore, in order to get to the root of the problem, the bureau has set up radio broadcasting inspectors to listen to the programs broadcast by each radio station every day. If they encounter anything suspicious, they will immediately stop it. However, the work scope of the inspectors is vast, and they are in a difficult situation to cope with. Therefore, the bureau has recently increased the number of inspectors to meet the needs of the work.</p>
<p>Lending Records The above are all preventive measures on the negative side. Preparations are also being made on the positive side. First, the Central Broadcasting Industry Management Office will issue a weekly broadcasting publication, selecting more than 80 dramas and stories. In addition, the bureau, to promote national thought, has also purchased a large number of party songs and recorded speeches by celebrities, which will be lent free of charge to radio stations in the future to enrich the content of the broadcast.</p>
<p>Registering Announcers There are no statistics on the announcers of broadcasting stations, and their origin, age, and resume are unknown. Now the bureau is starting to investigate in preparation for future registration. The identity and business of the announcers are closely related to the radio business, so it is also sorted out accordingly. It is heard that as many as six or seven hundred people have been investigated. Registration will be carried out as soon as the investigation procedures are completed.</p>
<h3>Robbery Leads to Economic Distress: Monk Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>A Letter to Fuyuan Hall Requests Corpse Retrieval and Coffin Burial, Specifying Black Monastic Robes and Paper Money at the Waist</p>
<p>The abbot of Jiqing Nunnery in Xinjing, northwest of Shanghai, Zen Master Zeming, aged thirty this year and a native of Chongming, recently sent a letter to Fuyuan Hall of the French Concession, stating that on the sixth night of the lunar month, a robbery occurred at the temple. He was bound with wire and robbed for forty or fifty minutes, resulting in a loss of about two hundred yuan. At the time, he recognized that one of the robbers had a dark pockmarked face, yellow hair, and a short stature. The next day, he reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau. The robbers were arrested and sent to the headquarters, but so far, the interrogation has yielded no results. He is currently in economic distress, and the local lay Buddhists remain indifferent. Therefore, in extreme suffering and helplessness, he committed suicide by drowning in the Zhanghuabang River. He specified that he was wearing black monastic robes and had six five-yuan Central Bank banknotes wrapped in paper inside his belt. He requested the hall to retrieve and bury his corpse and notify the directors of Beixinjing, Li Kelin, and others. The letter was sent from the Baxian Inn on East Zilaihuo Street. It is an unprecedented event for a monk to commit suicide by drowning due to economic distress caused by robbery. Upon receiving the letter, the hall immediately notified the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau, instructing the rescue boat to keep a lookout for the body in the river.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was Exceptionally Hot in the City</h3>
<p>Citizens Suffer Heatstroke, Beggar Collapses and Dies Suddenly</p>
<p>The weather in the city was extremely hot, especially yesterday, reaching as high as 95.2 degrees at noon. Moreover, it was sunny all day, unlike the previous few days which had occasional showers, making the heat and humidity particularly oppressive. The Infectious Disease Hospital has already admitted patients with heatstroke. The number of patients with gastroenteritis, dysentery, diarrhea, and other illnesses is increasing daily. Yesterday, it was reported that a beggar collapsed and died suddenly at the entrance of Beigongyi Lane on North Mongolia Road due to heatstroke. The local police station reported the incident to the authorities, who conducted an inspection and arranged for coffin burial. If the heatwave does not subside soon, it is feared that summer epidemics will become increasingly prevalent.</p>
<h3>Wang Xinggao Granted Bail During Appeal Period After Acquittal</h3>
<p>High Court Third Branch Orders Bail of 10,000 Yuan, but Requires Written Guarantee from a Business to Suspend Detention</p>
<p>Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, aged forty-one this year, a suspected instigator in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World entertainment venue, was arrested on January 13, 1934, based on the accusation of Zhao Guangfu, the apprehended assassin. The French Concession police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, together with detectives from the Public Concession's Lao Zha Station, and arrested Wang at the Central Hotel on Liuma Road. He was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court, which initiated public prosecution according to law. The initial trial resulted in Wang Xinggao being sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Wang appealed to the High Court's Third Branch and submitted photographs taken on June 17, 1933, in Hankou, at a welcoming ceremony for Zhang Dajun from Jiangsu, as evidence to the contrary. The High Court requested the Hankou Court in Hubei to investigate. After a long period, the final arguments were concluded on February 6 of this year, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on February 11, simultaneously with the appeal case of Gu Zhuxuan for murder. Because the Gu case involved bribery of a guard and instigation of the original accuser to recant, the conclusion of the debate was revoked, and the debate was reopened. After more than four months of investigation, the High Court's Third Branch ruled on the 26th of last month to overturn the original verdict and declare Wang Xinggao not guilty. At the time, Wang's defense lawyer requested in court that bail be granted during the appeal period. The court instructed him to submit a written request for a ruling. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, Wang submitted a request to the High Court's Third Branch, requesting the suspension of detention. Upon receiving the request, the High Court, yesterday morning, instructed Judge Wang Yue to visit the Xing No. 3 Court and bring Wang Xinggao to court for questioning. After the interrogation, the court ordered Wang to find a business within the concession to provide a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan and released him from detention. After the order was given, Wang was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Sues Father-in-Law for Child Support</h3>
<p>Father-in-Law Claims Daughter-in-Law is Addicted to Gambling and Does Not Follow Family Rules, Requests Dismissal of the Original Suit. The Court Orders a Postponement for Further Verification</p>
<p>Li Hongfu, a comprador for the Osaka Merchant Shipping Company at 184 Yangshupu Road, a native of Ningbo, was recently jointly sued in civil court by his daughter-in-law Cao, as legal representative for her ten-year-old son Tingchun, nine-year-old Tingxuan, seven-year-old daughter Yier, three-year-old Xier, and two-year-old Boer, against her father-in-law Li Hongfu. The suit alleged that he neglected to provide support and requested 48,000 yuan in national currency for twenty years of support, as well as the return of two suitcases of clothing and silverware worth 4,300 yuan, and permission for provisional execution and litigation relief. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Tao in the thirteenth court of the First Special District Court. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Xu Shihao argued on his behalf. He stated that the defendant's son, Xianming, married the plaintiff Li Cao in February of the 15th year of the Republic [1926]. After entering the family, she disrespected her elders, was addicted to gambling, and did not follow family rules. At that time, Xianming worked for the Japanese Postal Shipping Company and earned a considerable income. Believing that they could be independent, she instigated Xianming to provoke disputes and demand separation. In February of the following year, they were allowed to separate. At that time, Xianming's salary had increased to 70 yuan, and his father provided no financial support. The clothing and silverware were taken away at the time of separation, and that was nine years ago. After the separation, the plaintiff did not practice thrift and manage the household but continued to gamble outside all day and squandered money as before. Therefore, Xianming's income was insufficient, and he was heavily in debt. On April 3 of this year, he embezzled over 2,400 yuan and falsely reported a theft to cover the deficit. There is a police record of this. Unexpectedly, she did not advise her husband but instead fabricated stories, falsely claiming that the defendant suddenly stopped providing monthly support and further claiming that her husband was missing, creating fictitious facts. Ms. Cao is the daughter of Cao Lanbin and inherited over 20,000 yuan three years ago. She is not incapable of supporting herself and should be requested to dismiss the plaintiff's suit. When questioned, Li Cao admitted to receiving the money. The court ordered a postponement for further verification and instructed her to pay the litigation fees.</p>
<h3>Son-in-Law Sues Mother-in-Law for Not Recognizing Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Requests Confirmation that Zhang Baoqiong is Zhang Zhuanchu's Adopted Daughter; Defendants Relocated, Court Orders Public Notice</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuanchu, a Cantonese native who had served as Deputy Director of the Hunan-Hubei General Salt Transport and Sales Bureau, Director of the Shanghai Oil Tax Bureau's Pig Oil and Special Products Office, and Director of the Guangzhao Public Association, lived at 27 Datong Lane, Seymour Road. He owned the Detai Xiang Oil Factory and had accumulated substantial wealth. At the time, Zhang had adopted a boy and a girl, named Jiongjian and Baoqiong, respectively. On the 24th day of the lunar month in the 17th year of the Republic [1928], Baoqiong married Yan Minchu, a Cantonese native. After the marriage, she had two sons, one of whom died young, leaving only one son, named Shaoping. Yan Zhang Baoqiong died of illness on February 7 of last year, and Zhang Zhuanchu also passed away on March 12 of this year. At that time, Yan Minchu sent a mourning banner in the name of his son-in-law. Now, because the Zhang family has expressed a lack of recognition of Zhang Baoqiong's status, Yan Minchu, in his capacity as the legal representative of Yan Shaoping, hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yinye to file a lawsuit against Zhang Zhuanchu's wife, Chen, and Zhang Jiongjian, seeking confirmation that Shaoping's mother, Zhang Baoqiong, was Zhang Zhuanchu's adopted daughter and ordering them to pay the litigation costs. The court approved the request, and Judge Peng Shi of the First Special Court opened the Civil No. 4 Court for a hearing yesterday. Because the whereabouts of the defendants seemed to have changed, the summons could not be served, and no one appeared in court to respond to the lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyers stated the case, saying that the defendants' address was kept secret and that inquiries to their attorney, Zhao Chuanding, were refused. Therefore, this case requests the court to issue a public notice. Once a public notice is issued, the defendants will be able to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit. During the period of public notice, the plaintiff will make every effort to find the defendants' address and report it to the court for another summons. Judge Peng verified the report and approved the plaintiff's request for a public notice, and the case was postponed.</p>
<h3>Five Robbers Arrested in Dafang Hotel</h3>

The detectives continued to arrest Chen at his address. At noon that day, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 2 Court. Attorney Yuan Jiahuan of the Police Affairs Office presented the case, requesting a one-week postponement for detailed investigation and then requesting the court to handle the case. Judge Wang Gangxu verified and interrogated the defendants one by one, then ordered a postponement for another hearing on the morning of the 8th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Postal Items Uncovered</h3>
<p>Ninety-Seven Pieces of Mail Seized, Six Suspects Arrested on the Spot, Awaiting Transfer to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Yuangitugboat of the Suhang Route of the Yuantong Steamboat Company in Suzhou River, tugging the Togyong boat, arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou with passengers. Having received a confidential report beforehand that the stewards and sailors of the two boats were smuggling a large number of unstamped mail items, the local postal authorities, together with customs inspectors led by Mr. Hu, and water patrol detectives Shen Changshan, Xu Juelu, and others, rushed to the two boats and searched them. A total of ninety-seven mail items were seized, all of which were smuggled for profit.

<h3>Staff Member of the Municipal Audit Office Entices a Married Woman</h3>
<p>Incites Divorce, Leading to Disputes</p>
<p>Zhu Bomin, a young man from Shaanxi, aged twenty-six, works as a staff member at the Municipal Audit Office on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. Zhu is frivolous and lustful. In February of this year, he seduced Liu (aged twenty-six), the wife of Tao Youwei, a tenant in his residence in Hanxing Lane. Tao works at an enamel factory and is often away from home, so Zhu and Liu took advantage of this to enjoy secret affairs in a hotel near the North Station. Zhu suddenly incited Liu to divorce her husband and marry him instead. Liu, swayed by his words, discussed the matter with Tao Youwei. Unexpectedly, Zhu suddenly avoided meeting her, leaving Liu in a difficult situation, not knowing what to do. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Liu saw Zhu walking on Baoshan Road, near Baotong Road, and called out to him. Zhu ignored her and ran away. Liu chased after him, attracting a crowd of onlookers. The police, after questioning them, learned of the situation and brought both of them to the North Station Branch, where Liu's husband, Tao Youwei, was summoned for questioning.</p>

<h3>Liu Haisu's Second European Tour Exhibition Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Presides, Mayor Wu Unveils</p>
<p>Three hundred works from the famous contemporary painter Liu Haisu's second European tour were previewed yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, presided over the event, and Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of the city, unveiled the exhibition. The event was attended by the consuls general of England, America, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia in Shanghai, as well as Wang Yiting, Shen Enfu, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Shouyong, Li Zhaohuan, Guo Chengen, Gao Jianfu, Jian Youwen, Mei Lanfang, Li Dachao, Xu Peihuang, Wang Changchun, Yan Ganyuan, Wang Jiyuan, Wu Yun Chu, and over a thousand others. The art exhibition will officially open today and will be open daily from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Details of yesterday's preview are as follows:</p>
<p>Cai's Speech: He said, in brief, "Mr. Liu Haisu is a master painter of our time and has been engaged in the New Art Movement for over twenty years. Chinese art history has been divided into a major divide by Mr. Liu. Leaders of the British and French art circles, such as Leloar, Beining, and Quemaie, have all praised him as a master of the Chinese Renaissance. His talent, academic ability, experience, and value are well known to the world, and I cannot add another word. In 1933, Mr. Liu went to Europe for the second time to exhibit his paintings, and he was welcomed enthusiastically in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Italy, England, and Czechoslovakia. The public opinion was excellent. The Berlin Daily and the London Times even said that China has such a culture, and we still want to invade, which is really against reason. The German and French governments specially opened a special room in the National Museum in Berlin and Paris to display Mr. Liu's recent works, which made me feel emotional. Art, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or Western, should be viewed in its entirety. However, since the national power has declined, everything has declined. For a time, scholars were most obsessed with Europeanization. Everything, everything, was based on European teachers, as if no one in China for thousands of years was worthy of appreciation. Alas, this kind of thinking is really too self-deprecating. Our leader advocates nationalism and psychological construction, and is concerned about the inherent civilization and national essence, which is of profound significance. Now, Mr. Liu is spreading his unique skills internationally, making Europeans aware that there are great people in our country. After returning home, he will exhibit his works from his travels in various countries in Shanghai. I believe that the activities of artists are deeply related to the great cause of the national revival of our country."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying, "Today is the opening of the exhibition. Mr. Liu has won special honor internationally. Now, he will exhibit his works from his second European tour and his new works after returning home in the city, allowing the four million people of this city to enjoy the masterpieces of the great master of our country's art. This is really a fortunate thing. In recent years, the central and local governments of our country have spared no effort in promoting aesthetic education, because in the current situation of national decline, the revival of the nation and the improvement of national civilization cannot be achieved without the promotion of aesthetic education. Mr. Liu's efforts and contributions are truly a great driving force for the country and the nation."</p>
<p>Liu's Reply: Haisu traveled to Europe twice to exhibit his paintings, never forgetting to create. Today is the preview of his humble works, and he is honored to have guests from all walks of life present. Haisu has devoted himself to art for thirty years and is ashamed of not having made much achievement. He presents his humble works to seek the advice of gentlemen.</p>
<h3>Xinli Camel Wool Factory Closes Down for Liquidation</h3>
<p>Appoints Accountant Jiang Xinzhao as Liquidator</p>
<p>The Shenbao News Agency reports that the market is flooded with imported goods, which has greatly affected domestic factories. Xinli Camel Wool Factory, a woolen textile factory in this city, specializes in weaving camel wool. The manager is Mr. Huang Pinliang. The business was very prosperous. Since last year, sales in the north have sharply decreased, and the business has suffered a slight loss. It could have been maintained, but unfortunately, starting in January of this year, shareholders Lin, Sun, and others emptied the factory's inventory and assets, causing the entire factory to shut down. Recently, they were sued for rent arrears and had to declare bankruptcy and liquidation. Accountant Jiang Xinzhao was appointed as the liquidator to handle the liquidator's accounts and to deal with unfinished matters. Accountant Jiang has been actively carrying out the liquidation.</p>
<h3>Antique Market Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>The antique market has moved to a new building at 218-226 Guangdong Road and officially opened yesterday (the 1st). The market hired Cai Jiemin, Wang Yiting, and Pan Gongzhan to officiate the opening ceremony, accompanied by the entire orchestra of the orphanage. Wang Hanliang, the chairman of the board, gave an opening speech, saying in brief, "Fifteen years ago, this industry was oppressed by foreigners and was often offended. Therefore, colleagues in Shanghai organized this market. Over the past fifteen years, despite the ups and downs, the officers have all been voluntary. Therefore, the market has reached today. Now, moving to a new location, I hope that you will earnestly study and not focus on making profits. The country preserves antiques, and our industry should fulfill its duties, do its best to preserve them, and not allow them to be lost. However, most of the items sold in this market are modern items and have no preservation value." Cai Jiemin and Pan Gongzhan then delivered speeches. After the ceremony, a large number of guests visited. There were many exhibits, making it the best in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis and Treatment Situation at Hongkou Epidemic Hospital</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital on Yicai Road, Xiangyan Bridge in this city, reopened on June 20. In just ten days, the number of patients reached 1,420, of which 615 received vaccinations, and the rest suffered mostly from gastroenteritis, indigestion, and influenza. As the hottest period of the summer approaches, the hospital may be overwhelmed. Most of the residents near the hospital are poor, and they usually lack basic hygiene knowledge. Once the weather is extremely hot, those who work hard are particularly vulnerable to diseases, which spread quickly. Therefore, the establishment of the hospital is necessary and appropriate. It is said that Bao Fuqing, a resident of Yuezhou Road, suffered from acute gastroenteritis in August of last year and was in critical condition. After being saved by the hospital, he was very grateful and intended to repay the hospital. However, the hospital was about to open, so he put it aside. Now that he knows the hospital has reopened, he has specially made a plaque with the inscription "Resurrected My Dried Fish" and sent it respectfully, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Chen Junao to Broadcast Stories Starting Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Chen excels in eloquence and has a wealth of stories. Moreover, the weather is hot now, and many people stay up late to enjoy the cool air. It is expected that this program will be very popular among listeners.</p>
<h3>Wanchuntang Chinese Pharmacy Opens</h3>

<h3>Calligraphy and Painting Fan Surfaces Co-Created by Famous Artists</h3>

Therefore, those who come to ask for calligraphy are endless, and he is too busy to write.

<h3>Banks Only Occupy Horse Thousand Factories</h3>
<p>On June 27th, around 3:00 PM, about twenty-one figures from the Shanghai banking community, along with the Banking Association, visited the Huade Light Bulb Factory on Ouyang Road in Zhabei to conduct an on-site inspection. The factory's General Manager Tang Zhaoneng, Assistant Manager Li Qingxiang, and key personnel including Li Qinghua, Li Zhaohua, and Li Jinbo warmly welcomed them and guided them through the various departments, which was met with satisfaction. Subsequently, Tang Wenkai and Li Yipei of the Banking Association successively expressed their sympathetic views, stating that Huade products have long been seen on the market, and while advertisements in newspapers highlight their features and excellence, they had previously regarded these as mere promotions, lacking certainty. After today's on-site reference, witnessing Huade factory workers diligently working, strict management, sophisticated machinery, and rapid delivery, achieving superior results, these advantages are rare in other factories. Therefore, they dare to make this assertion, what they heard and saw was indeed not an exaggeration. They hope that the leaders of Huade will continue to work harder, so that the national goods industry, which has always been criticized by foreigners, can establish a stable foundation and defeat foreign goods. Then, it is not only Huade light bulbs that shine brightly, but also our Chinese motherland that adds infinite glory.</p>

Among them, several imitation Song dynasty cloth paintings, whether viewed up close or from afar, are simple, vigorous, and rich in texture, indistinguishable from ancient works. His promotion of ancient Chinese culture is significant. Last year, when the exhibition was held in Beijing, Chairman Lin Xin personally inscribed, stating that the paintings he painted are naturally elegant. Over the years, his exhibited works in overseas painting exhibitions have been praised by people from various friendly countries, which shows how valuable his paintings are. From June 27th to July 1st, it was supposed to close yesterday. Local people felt that the period was too short and could not provide the public with appreciation. Many connoisseurs especially requested to extend the exhibition for three days.</p>

<h3>The Southern Goods Industry in Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(A Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce - 30)</p>
<p>7. Market Prices: The market prices of southern and northern goods vary widely and are difficult to describe in detail. The market prices of the same products from different regions vary significantly, depending on the quality. The fluctuation of market prices depends not only on the above-mentioned distinctions but also on the abundance of the production area and the smoothness of market sales. However, the market prices of this industry have been rising since its inception, with few declines, resulting in the high prices of recent years. The main reasons for this are: first, the increasing level of social life and the frequent need for these goods, as well as increased tariffs; and second, natural disasters and man-made calamities, which have mutually afflicted the people, preventing them from living and working in peace and causing a sharp decline in production, combined with reliance on foreign goods. As for the way this industry buys goods in the market, there is a distinction between southern regulations and northern regulations. Southern regulations refer to sales from wholesalers to retailers, while northern regulations refer to bills issued by suppliers to wholesalers. For example, for a bag of melon seeds, the supplier bills the wholesaler at 83% of the market price, and then deducts two catties of skin per bag, priced at 14 yuan. Under southern regulations, the wholesaler sells a bag of melon seeds to the retailer at 88% of the market price, without deducting the bag skin, which accounts for seven catties, equivalent to one yuan, which is the handling fee, and is priced at 15 yuan. Wholesalers' sales prices vary slightly. If the market is brisk, they sell according to the bill. If the market weakens after the goods are purchased, the wholesalers sell at a discount (i.e., deducting the one-yuan handling fee). However, northern regulations require payment in cash, while southern regulations allow payment in two months, followed by an additional fifteen days. Therefore, each method has its advantages. Therefore, merchants in the interior with sufficient capital mostly purchase directly from suppliers.</p>

<p>Berlin Correspondence: Before the opening of the 11th Olympic Games at noon on the 11th (July 20th), the torch, lit by collecting sunlight with a concave mirror, will depart from the altar on Mount Olympus in ancient Olympia. It will take 11 days and nights, covering a distance of 3,055 kilometers, passing through seven countries, and reaching the Berlin venue of this World Games. The last torchbearer will light the Games torch, making it shine. This torch is intended to represent the outstanding posture and spirit of the Olympic movement. The torch relay work has been arranged in cooperation with the seven countries it passes through. The route has also been specified, from Athens, Delphi, Thessaloniki, Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, Vienna, Prague to Berlin. The times and locations for each country's torchbearers to take over have also been determined. The torch will burn for about ten minutes. Torchbearers will be chosen from the most outstanding athletes in each country. The last torch will arrive at the Berlin Games on August 1st.</p>
<p>Three thousand torchbearers will rush to the Games venue. After the last torchbearer lights the Games torch, the giant clock will strike loudly in front of millions of spectators from around the world. Athletes from various countries will enter the venue in an orderly procession. The chairman of the committee will deliver a short speech, followed by the opening ceremony. At the same time, ceremonial guns will be fired, the Olympic flag will be raised, and doves will be released. It is hoped that Spiridion Louis, the marathon champion of the 1896 Athens Games, can arrive at the same time from Mount Olympus in Greece with an olive branch, symbolizing the power of world unity and peace. After the opening ceremony, the military band will play the Olympic anthem, composed by Richard Strauss. Then, athletes will take an oath: "I swear to make the Games successful with utmost sincerity, abide by the Games regulations, and honor my motherland and the Games with the spirit of sports." After the oath, the athletes will withdraw, and the Games ceremony will be completed. In short, this Games is not only an international friendship competition, increasing the honor of sports, but also strengthening physical fitness, expanding patriotic enthusiasm, and promoting the spirit of sports. Germany sincerely welcomes outstanding athletes and visitors from various countries, striving to reduce various difficulties and achieve pleasant and satisfactory results.

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>New Discovery in Modern Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>Venereal disease is a disease that leads to national ruin, and also a disease of civilization. Therefore, the number of sufferers increases daily, and various drugs for treating gonorrhea have emerged endlessly. However, in terms of actual efficacy, most have failed to achieve complete perfection. If the bactericidal power is strong, it damages healthy parts of the body; and it also severely harms organs such as the stomach, intestines, and kidneys. Often, shortly after taking the medication, there are adverse stimulations such as vomiting and dizziness, which reduce the body's resistance to toxins and instead provide opportunities for gonorrhea bacteria to multiply. Therefore, the gonorrhea worsens. If there is no bactericidal effect, taking such drugs is the same as not taking them. As a result, the cry that there is no cure for gonorrhea can be heard everywhere.</p>
<p>With today's scientific advances, can gonorrhea really be incurable? According to reports from major medical doctors around the world, Robeter's "Klinnon" drug can be called an outstanding new drug for treating gonorrhea. The raw material of this drug is a non-toxic bactericide. What is a non-toxic bactericide? It completely eliminates the side effects of the drug while preserving its pure bactericidal effect. Moreover, after taking "Klinnon," not only is there local sterilization, but the entire body also develops antitoxins, preventing the spread of gonorrhea bacteria to various places. This is especially outstanding among gonorrhea treatments worldwide. For complications and secondary conditions of gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, arthritis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., after taking the medicine, inflammation is relieved, pain is calmed, bacteria are killed, and impurities are cleared within a few weeks. However, when purchasing "Klinnon," be sure to recognize the three characters "Klinnon" and do not be misled by the words of others, resulting in the purchase of inferior drugs, which will only worsen the disease. It will be too late to regret it then.</p>
<h3>The Interrelated Relationship of Gastrointestinal Diseases</h3>
<p>The stomach is responsible for the intake of food, acting as a bag for storing food. After considerable digestion, it sends the food into the intestines to carry out the actual digestion, and then absorption occurs. This is a general overview. A detailed discussion cannot be exhausted in a short paper, but readers will understand once they grasp this. It is important to chew food finely; otherwise, if it is too hard, dirty, unclean, too hot, too cold, rotten, or fermented, it will damage the stomach's function after eating, causing the gastric mucosa to be stimulated, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. At the same time, because the food in the stomach is not digested, when it reaches the intestines, the peristalsis of the intestines also becomes abnormal, leading to diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery. This is a brief overview of the relationship between gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<p>During the summer season, it is easy to develop the aforementioned stomach diseases. At the initial stage, it is best to take preparations that prevent decay and correct intestinal peristalsis. Do not rashly stop vomiting or diarrhea, as this will allow pathogens to breed inside. This is truly essential. Unfortunately, although there are many stomach remedies available, none of them effectively treat intestinal diseases as well. Only the drug "Strong Stomach Essence" combines the function of "strengthening the stomach" with the effectiveness of clearing the intestines. Therefore, whether the stomach disease is new or old, with frequent belching, chest tightness, pain after eating, loss of appetite, or intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, borborygmus, frequent and empty farts, and constipation, all can be fundamentally cured with this drug. Because it contains ovovitellin and various precious ingredients for nourishing blood and brain, it is effective for those who have been ill for a long time and cannot recover, the elderly, smokers with constipation, and those quitting addiction. After taking it, recovery will gradually occur within a few weeks, eventually leading to complete eradication and prevention of recurrence. Moreover, because it contains three important nutrients: vitamins A, B, and D, in addition to effectively treating beriberi caused by vitamin B deficiency, it also has great health-strengthening power.</p>
<h3>Underdevelopment and Maldevelopment</h3>
<p>Underdevelopment refers to the inability of various parts of the body to reach the level of an adult. Maldevelopment refers to development that does not conform to the normal state of an adult. The cause is often due to endocrine dysfunction. The phenomenon of underdevelopment is more obvious in the lower parts of the body, such as when a person has reached adulthood but the lower body is short, still like a child. Or, although developed, it may be arched and curved, but the latter is not as common, while the former is often encountered by those who are addicted to masturbation or who have early marriage and excessive sexual activity. This not only causes great obstacles to future offspring but is also unimaginable in terms of sexual happiness. Those who have such conditions should seek treatment early to prevent the disease from deepening.</p>
<p>Since the cause of this condition is due to endocrine dysfunction, organ therapy should be used to treat it. However, the effectiveness of such hormone preparations is often lost due to the selection of materials and preparation methods. Only the "Body-Complete" for men and "Beauty-Complete" for women, invented by endocrinologist Mellen, are particularly effective. The raw materials are taken from the testicles and ovaries of adolescent male and female animals, extracted using scientific methods, and made into hormones. The value is high and cannot be compared to general low-priced products. After taking it, the reproductive system tissues can be completely transformed within three to several weeks. It can cure male underdevelopment, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, incomplete erection, as well as female menstrual difficulties, irregular periods, flat and underdeveloped breasts and buttocks, and infertility in both sexes, headaches, insomnia, palpitations, mental depression, lack of interest, memory loss, lower back pain, and weak legs. It can also make muscles full and delicate, make the complexion rosy, and remove wrinkles and gray hair. Therefore, major European and American medical experts have long adopted it.</p>
<h3>Women's Hidden Ailments</h3>
<p>So-called hidden ailments, men may sometimes not take them seriously, but in women, due to their natural shyness, even diseases that we consider normal, women are always too embarrassed to speak about. For example, the most common ailment in women, leucorrhea, is medically very ordinary, but they often do not tell anyone, which instead worsens the leucorrhea. Such as vaginal erosion, lower abdominal distension, menstrual irregularities, and constant discharge of foul fluid, attracting external bacteria, leading to sudden serious illness. It is necessary to break with old ideas and seek medical treatment early.</p>
<p>There are many treatments for leucorrhea, but the one most favored by doctors is the "Car-and-Snow vaginal tablet." This drug has a great effect on killing bacteria and stopping local secretions. When this tablet is placed deep into the vagina, it can clean leucorrhea in the shortest time, making it as clean as a virgin's. However, if it is caused by gonorrhea, "Klinnon" can be taken internally at the same time. If it is caused by physical weakness, "Beauty-Complete" can be taken. Treating according to this method not only cures but also eradicates the root cause. This "vaginal tablet" has also become popular in China recently, because of its accurate efficacy.</p>
<h3>The Only Path to Curing Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Although gonorrhea has been regarded as a difficult disease to treat since ancient times, in fact, there are more drugs for treating gonorrhea than any other preparation. This is precisely because there is no specific drug for gonorrhea, so gonorrhea drugs have emerged one after another like bamboo shoots after rain. However, upon careful examination, few are truly effective. Most of them contain ingredients such as cubeb and sandalwood oil, which can impair the function of the stomach and intestines and block the kidneys. This can cause urinary retention, leading to autointoxication and endangering life. As for the so-called penetrating sterilization, it is only a local treatment. It may be effective for acute urethritis, but it is of no use for chronic gonorrhea and complications. This is a sign that gonorrhea toxins have invaded the entire body, which cannot be addressed locally.</p>
<p>According to the latest gonorrhea treatment concepts in the medical community of various countries, during the acute phase, threshold stimulus therapy (Schwellenreiztherapie) is suitable, which can enhance the disease prevention function of cells. For chronic cases, specific treatment (Specifische Behandjung) is appropriate. However, this method was previously used for injection. Due to the inconvenience of various injection procedures, scholars have strived for improvement and changed it to an oral medication, which has become today's "Klinnon" that has spread all over the world, making it extremely convenient for patients to treat themselves. It has excellent effectiveness for treating all acute and chronic gonorrhea in both men and women. This drug has the function of eradicating acute balanitis, chronic prostatitis, and orchitis in men, as well as acute vulvar gonorrhea and vaginal gonorrhea and chronic uterine gonorrhea in women, and can achieve complete recovery. According to statistics from famous European hospitals, 92 out of 100 men who took "Klinnon" achieved complete cure. Because women are more compliant with health maintenance and abstain from sexual activity, and also use "Car-and-Snow vaginal tablets" externally at the same time, the effectiveness is even better than in men. It is truly a perfect preparation, so its spread around the world is inevitable.</p>
<h3>What Method Can Radically Cure Seminal Emission?</h3>
<p>Seminal emission is a disease that afflicts many people in the world. Most of them, in their youth, are stimulated by sex and mistakenly engage in masturbation, leading to neurasthenia. Therefore, those who suffer from this disease often experience dizziness, headaches, palpitations, forgetfulness, and a sharp decline in judgment. Those who suffer from this often fall into pessimism and depression, and some even become world-weary.</p>
<p>Drugs for this disease are not uncommon, but they are either too drastic or too mild. Overly drastic drugs only block the seminal ducts and have significant side effects, causing sexual desire to increase. Those that are too mild have the name of taking medicine but not the reality of taking medicine. The drug "Sperm-Nourishing Tablets" by Te-Nai's is currently popular and renowned worldwide. It can adjust sexual tissues, so that seminal emission, no matter how many times per week, seminal dribbling during defecation or exertion, or nocturnal emissions, are all completely cured. The neurasthenia, dizziness, and depression induced by seminal emission all disappear. Moreover, this drug can enhance willpower, so it can quit masturbation, which is a fundamental solution for seminal emission. "Sperm-Nourishing Tablets" are sold in Chinese and Western pharmacies and Tianhe Pharmacy.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Lung Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment of Colds</h3>
<p>The onset of pulmonary tuberculosis is mostly chronic. Therefore, most people are unaware of the progress of the first and second stages. However, the initial symptom is a cold. If a cold cough lasts for two or three weeks, it tends to progress to lung tuberculosis. Therefore, it is extremely important to cure the initial cold. Once lung tuberculosis has formed, the whole body weakens, there is hemoptysis, loss of appetite, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occur. Weight decreases daily, and sometimes there is stabbing pain in the chest, sudden hemoptysis, and gradually high fever develops. At this point, it has entered the third stage.</p>
<p>The above is the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. For its treatment, nutrition should be improved and the production of calcium in the lungs promoted. In terms of medication, an anti-acidic agent must be taken to remove the wax from the tuberculosis bacteria, then tuberculosis is not difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p>Checking the quality of tuberculosis bacteria and nutrition can increase the body's resistance. If tuberculosis bacteria lose their waxy substance, their resistance will be sharply reduced and they will be easily captured. "Lung-Nourishing Nair" is made by Dr. Tu-Mei using various precious chemical agents, so its efficacy is obvious and its power is particularly strong. However, it does not have the disadvantages of being overly hot and dry, making it suitable for taking in summer. It does not have the greasiness of cod liver oil but has the effect of nourishing. It effectively treats all stages of lung tuberculosis symptoms, such as hemoptysis, cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, chest pain, tidal fever, night sweats, and body weakness. Moreover, because it can remove inflammatory secretions from the trachea, it is effective for chronic cough, stubborn phlegm, asthma in the elderly, colds, and whooping cough. If lung tuberculosis is combined with neurasthenia, men can take "Body-Complete" at the same time to treat seminal emission and kidney atrophy, and strengthen their nerves. If women also have virtual symptoms such as menstrual irregularities, they can take "Beauty-Complete" at the same time to regulate menstruation, nourish blood, and invigorate the body. Then other symptoms such as insomnia and palpitations can be eliminated, reaching the realm of longevity. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Dr. Deng Yuanhe, Lung Disease Specialist</h3>
<p>Address: Intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Consultation hours: 4 PM to 6 PM.</p>
<h3>A Collection of "Klinnon" Treatment Experiences</h3>
<p>Systemic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Jiuzhi, due to suffering from gonorrhea and missing the opportunity for radical treatment, coupled with a love of exercise, suddenly developed systemic paralysis, bone and joint pain, and inability to turn around, suffering greatly. Urination was also extremely difficult, followed by blood after urination, symptoms were extremely dangerous. Various drugs had been tried almost everywhere, but there was no effect. This is systemic gonorrhea infection. Introduced by Dr. Dai De, he took "Klinnon." After taking it for about five or six weeks, all gonorrhea bacteria were eliminated.</p>
<p>Redness and Swelling with Pain</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhu Junshou, after drinking, accidentally entered a brothel, and the toxins broke out immediately. Initially, the urethra felt like ants crawling, with alternating pain and itching. Then, the urethra was burning hot, with pain like needles. There was frequent urination, and the glans was red and swollen. Because a lot of tea-green pus was secreted, the foreskin was also stimulated by these toxins, causing the foreskin to swell and turn over, causing great pain. He could not sleep peacefully and had no appetite. Because he secretly concealed it from others, he secretly took miscellaneous over-the-counter drugs, but they were ineffective. Instead, the pain increased. Later, introduced by Dr. Deng Yuanhe, he took "Klinnon." After taking it for only a few weeks, the inflammation subsided, the pain disappeared, the swelling receded, and the urine cleared, and he was radically cured.</p>
<p>Repeated Recurrence</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lin Yi'e, previously suffered from gonorrheal cystitis, lower abdominal pain, and many precipitates in the urine. He sent this urine to experts for examination, which showed a large number of gonorrhea bacteria. Fortunately, introduced by Dr. Yao Juyan, he recovered by taking "Klinnon." Mr. Lin did not pay attention, and the toxins were transmitted to his wife. Now that Mr. Lin's gonorrhea has healed, his wife's leucorrhea has not recovered, so it was re-transmitted, causing the old illness to recur. He still went to buy and take "Klinnon" and was fortunately cured in a few weeks. At this point, Mr. Lin realized the reason for its recurrence. It was due to his wife's leucorrhea. He bought "Klinnon" for her and used "Car-and-Snow vaginal tablets" externally, eradicating the leucorrhea and radically curing the gonorrhea in the shortest time. Mr. Lin and his wife have lived together for several years, and their love is stronger than ever and has not recurred.</p>
<p>Weak Body with Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tang Shenghai, was originally weak and plagued by gonorrhea. Three years passed without recovery, and the disease deepened and the body weakened. There was urinary discomfort, and thin strands of discharge would appear on the surface of the urine upon exertion. The symptoms of nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation in the past also worsened. Repeated medical treatment was ineffective. Later, fortunately introduced by Dr. Chen Shaohua, he took "Klinnon" and "Body-Complete" at the same time, and the effect was amazing. Urination felt smooth, and the symptoms of nocturnal emission, etc., were reduced by six or seven tenths. He continued to take them, and not only did the gonorrhea completely heal, but the weak body also became unusually strong, and he was full of energy. He was completely different from before. Therefore, Mr. Tang praised the great efficacy of "Klinnon" and "Body-Complete" everywhere.</p>

<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Consultation hours: 10 AM to 6 PM.</p>
<p>Gonorrheal Arthritis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal arthritis is the result of prolonged and untreated gonorrhea. Originally, when gonorrhea had not spread to the whole body, the bacteria were mostly concentrated in the genital area. Due to stimulation from drinking and sexual activity, gonorrhea bacteria invaded the joints through the blood, causing inflammation and suppuration, thus forming this disease. Patients exhibit systemic symptoms such as fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, and elevated body temperature, consistently above 40 degrees Celsius. The joints are painful and cannot be turned. If treatment is not sought urgently, the joints will become red, swollen, and suppurate, and sometimes turn into septicemia, which can endanger life.</p>
<p>The treatment of this condition, if given appropriate methods, is not difficult to eradicate. According to my experience in medical treatment over the years, I always use anti-gonorrhea serum for intravenous injection, supplemented by X-ray and electrotherapy to eliminate widespread gonorrhea bacteria. At the same time, I also administer the "Klinnon" special medicine for anti-inflammatory and pain relief to clear the gonorrhea toxins in the blood. Such internal and external treatment has a more significant effect and can always eliminate all gonorrhea bacteria in the shortest time. Moreover, even after various stimuli after recovery, it will never recur. However, those who are married must pay attention to the gonorrheal leucorrhea of their wives. Women who suffer from this leucorrhea have erosion in the lower body, which hinders urination, causes menstrual irregularities, and lower abdominal pain. It is also appropriate to take "Klinnon" internally and use vaginal tablets externally as suppositories, which can also be cured in a few weeks and will not recur after recovery.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Futures Market Closed, Spot Yarn Trading Slightly More Active</h3>
<p>Due to the semi-annual accounting and the closure of banks, the standard yarn and cotton market was closed for two days. However, spot yarn merchants still gathered in the market. Transactions were not strong. Merchants from Guangdong, Changsha, and other inland areas traded 200 bales at flat prices. Due to the continued decline in American cotton and the high prices of Indian and Liverpool cotton, market sentiment remained uncertain. 2,100 bales of cotton arrived.</p>
<h3>Benefit from Rain in Drought Areas, American Cotton Turns Weak Before Closing Due to Selling</h3>
<p>—Indian Cotton Exporters Buy and Rebound—</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with good news from Liverpool. Local merchants and Liverpool merchants bought, and there were few sellers. Prices rose one to six points in each month. Afterwards, local and Far East sellers sold to close positions, and the market weakened. Overall, the market was quiet. Merchants were waiting for loan cotton to be sold and the weather conditions. Before closing, private predictions suggested that some drought areas could benefit from rain. Local merchants sold, and the market suddenly turned weak. Spot prices fell six points, and futures prices fell six to ten points. English cotton spot prices rose six points, and futures prices rose ten points. Indian cotton prices rose due to exporters buying White Luo Creek cotton for July-August delivery and good news from Liverpool. Pingguo rose 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Orobi and Omla rose 0.25 rupees, and White Luo Creek rose 0.5 to 1.25 rupees. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for White Luo Creek cotton for April-May delivery on the 1st was 211.5 rupees, down 1.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Third-Grade Yarn Flat, Cotton Weak</h3>
<p>According to an Osaka telegram on the 1st, third-grade futures yarn rose or fell by 1 to 7 jiao, with the near month at 202.6 yuan and the far month at 197.3 yuan. Cotton futures fell 0.1 to 0.35 yuan, with the near month at 65.65 yuan and the far month at 61.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Outside Buying Interest in Standard Cotton Increases</h3>
<p>Ningbo Merchants Short Selling, Run Kang Hauling In More</p>
<p>The number of standard cotton accounts at the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange up to the end of June shows that the July contract traded at 261,600 dan, the August contract at 300,490 dan, the October contract at 349,000 dan, and the November contract at 228,000 dan, totaling 1,134,500 dan, a decrease of 147,400 dan from the 1,281,900 dan at the end of the previous month. After offsetting the long and short accounts, the net inventory was 314,800 dan. Among them, the buyers were still mainly from the banking sector, gold merchants, and public debt holders. The sellers were mostly local cotton firms and Ningbo merchants. The accounts with the largest transaction amounts are extracted below (unit: 100 dan):</p>
<h3>Grains: Covering Shorts and New Longs Emerge, Flour Rises Sharply by Six Fen</h3>
<p>Flour Exchange Only Trades Six Sessions in the Morning Due to Hot Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw uniform price increases in all months at the opening in the morning. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were Chicago down 5 jiao and Canada down 4 jiao. However, market sentiment was tense due to the gradual increase in domestic wheat quotations in various producing areas. In the Jinpu Railway area, such as Bengbu, grain merchants hoarded goods, and arrivals were very scarce. In the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway area, such as Wuxi, the combined price of high-quality goods already required more than 3 jiao, so the atmosphere was tense. Prices were raised by 3 to 4 fen at the opening, and then gradually increased with each session. Transactions were brisk. Only a few factories sold off, so prices continued to rise without looking back. According to the current situation, with the current rush of shipments being quite strong, the factories increased prices and shouted up to 5 fen. Based on actual considerations, it seems that the standard has not yet fallen. As for the increase in each month, this month alone was good for 6.5 fen, and the rest were 4, 5, and 6 fen. The December contract has already been opened, with an initial price of 3.045 yuan, and it also rose 3.25 li at the closing. Due to the hot weather, the flour exchange has only been operating in the morning since yesterday, with a total of six sessions. The afternoon session is temporarily suspended and will resume when the weather cools down.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Buying Interest Very Strong</h3>
<p>Distant Months Rose More Than One Jiao in the Morning</p>
<p>Slight Drop in 定 洋麥 Reported in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw uniform price increases in all months at the opening in the morning. Wheat quotations in inland areas were generally shouting around 3.5 jiao, and the quality was still around 90%. With this situation, market sentiment was naturally buoyant, so the opening prices for each month were raised by 3 to 4 fen. Later, with strong buying interest, it rose another 3 to 5 fen. Distant months were particularly bullish, such as the November contract, which rose 1.1 jiao. The December contract was opened for the first time at 4.96 yuan, which can be said to be extremely expensive. When the market opened in the afternoon, it suddenly saw a sharp decline because there were rumors of Victoria having 定 開, but it was not certain whether this was true, so market sentiment turned weak, and it fell by 3, 5, and 6 fen. In the end, the near month was good for 3 fen, and the far month was good for 6 and 7 fen. The spot wheat market, due to the high prices in the inland areas, and the standard was also good, high-quality goods were raised by 1.2 jiao, and Zhongguan goods were raised by 5 and 6 fen. Kaiming Guanguan Store wheat was 4.12 yuan, Zhongguan goods were raised by 5 and 6 fen, Kaiming Guanguan Store wheat was 4.35 yuan, Qingjiang wheat was 4.33 yuan, Huai'an wheat was 4.35 yuan, Qingjiang wheat was 4.33 yuan, Huai'an wheat was 4.3 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 4.26 yuan, secondary was 4.23 yuan, Nanjing wheat was 4.21 yuan, Puzhen wheat was 4.23 yuan, and Hure Gaozi wheat was 4.23 yuan. Jiangjiaba Wuyi wheat was 4.3 yuan, Quanjiao wheat was 4.29 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat was 4.2 jiao. Various grades of boat wheat ranged from 4.18 yuan to 4.36 yuan. Six thousand bags went to Fuxin, five thousand bags went to Fufeng, and two thousand bags went to Shenda.</p>
<h3>River Rice Market Mostly Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants totaled only about 20, with a total of more than 4,000 shi of goods. The sales market on this street was weak, and the Baowei Dalian merchants only handled more than 400 packages, so the situation turned soft, and the market appeared to be repaired. Thick early japonica and thin indica rice prices fell by a few points. Only Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan were still flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants from the river totaled nearly 20. The sales of white japonica rice on the market were slightly flatter than the previous market, with no price increases or decreases. The spot transactions of thin indica rice were average, with prices slightly softer. Yangbu customer orders for high-quality materials were still acceptable, and medium and lower quality materials were also flat. Prices for high-quality materials were stable, while medium and lower quality materials showed a slight downward trend. White yuan and other goods were priced flat.</p>
<h3>Zhongguan Native Rice Reduced Price for Sale</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for native rice from Zhongguan remained sluggish. Supply continued from various sources, but there was a long-standing lack of large buyers to move the product, resulting in a weakening situation. Especially for lower-grade rice, the hot weather made it difficult to store for long, so sellers were mostly reducing prices to clear stock. Yesterday, rice from Gan Province in Zhongguan was reduced by a small margin. Buyers from inland areas such as Pinghu purchased around 1,000 bags at prices of ten yuan or ten yuan, two dimes and three cents, more than one yuan less than higher-quality rice delivered later. Local buyers selectively purchased smaller quantities of higher-quality rice, which they were able to store, and sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices, so the prices of higher-quality rice remained stable. Total arrivals declared at the port were 3,201 bags of Jiangxi rice, 300 bags of Hunan rice, 175 bags of Hubei rice, 349 bags of Zhenjiang rice from the north, and 80 bags of Taiwanese rice. Apart from the 1,000 bags going inland, the remainder was bought by local merchants.</p>
<h3>Mung Beans in Short Supply, Market Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The primary market for mung bean sales is South China, with this area accounting for only a small portion. Most exports go to Luzon, with India and Japan also being significant. Therefore, market conditions are generally favorable. Currently, new crops are not arriving, and little old stock is coming in, with existing inventory also depleted. Statistics indicate approximately 41,000 bags of various types of mung beans in storage, the majority of which are of high quality, resulting in a relatively strong market. Yesterday, 40 bags of Ming Green mung beans from Luodian were sold at six yuan and two dimes, purchased by local merchants. There were also inquiries from Indian buyers, but no transactions were reported.</p>
<h3>Green Tea, Yokohama Raw Silk Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>—No change in New York or this city!—</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot prices in Yokohama opened at 712.5 yuan, up 7.5 yuan. Futures for December opened at 693 yuan, with market sentiment remaining stable. Prices for all silk products in New York remained unchanged. Spot and futures prices were up 0.5 to 2% from the previous day. Lyon raw silk fell by 0.75 francs. Shanghai and Guangdong silk also remained unchanged. Silk transactions in this port were quiet, and many export firms were on holiday due to the settlement period on July 1st. Sales of silk to user companies were also infrequent yesterday.</p>
<h3>Customs Auction of Rayon, Silk Mills Purchased Over Twenty Cases</h3>
<p>The market for rayon is particularly weak, with few transactions. Customs auctioned off No. 120 Tianqiao brand rayon for 409 to 410 yuan, selling over ten cases, which were purchased by silk mills in this city. The European No. 150 and No. 120 glossy rayon are difficult to move, with prices slightly lower, but there are still few buyers. A Japanese trading company in this port sold five cases of No. 150 Tianqiao brand matte rayon for 155 yuan, excluding tax. Furthermore, recent Japanese warehouse prices are set as follows: No. 120 matte, 144 yuan; No. 150 matte, 145 yuan; No. 120 glossy, 122 yuan; No. 150 glossy, 120 yuan; No. 60 glossy, 342 yuan; No. 75 glossy, 242 yuan; No. 100 glossy, 165 yuan; No. 250/300 glossy, 120 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qining Fragrant Tea Competes for Sales to England and Russia</h3>
<p>Qimen and Ningzhou fragrant black teas have recently seen a sudden increase in market activity due to purchases by Russian firms. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and the Russian Assistance Society conducted extensive searches, making the market very active. Market prices opened at 42 to 43 yuan, and the situation is very stable. According to news from England, Chinese Qimen black tea is highly sought after this year due to the delayed opening of the Shanghai market. The first and second batches have mostly arrived and are being sold immediately, with active sales. In particular, mid-grade teas around 100 yuan are selling well, and merchants are making profits, leading to frequent requests to replenish stock, which is a positive sign. Therefore, trading was brisk yesterday, especially for high-grade teas from Ningzhou. As for the green tea market, there have been slight changes. Lu Zhuang Ping Shui pearl tea is selling well, and market prices are showing an upward trend. Zhen Mei green tea, especially high-grade teas, continues to sell well. Lower-grade teas are slightly more sluggish than before due to the large influx of tea from Yushan and Kaihua.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Guild report, various types of Zhen Mei tea remained active yesterday. Jardine Matheson continued to buy vigorously, purchasing about 1,000 cases of mid- to high-grade Tun Zhen at 80 to 83 yuan. Over 200 cases of Hui Zhen were also purchased at 70 to 71 yuan. Over 100 cases of high-grade Yushan Zhen Mei were purchased at about 61 yuan. Xiehe selectively purchased over 180 cases of high-grade Hui Zhen, trading at 75 to 76 yuan. After the Tun Zhen market was stimulated by purchases from Tianyu and Jardine Matheson, selling prices appeared to be firm. Ping Shui tea transactions continued among major firms, with Jinlong buying a batch of Wannianqing and Hua Cha buying a batch of Meizhongxuan. Prices remained firm, but firms were concerned that the prices were too high and may not meet foreign demand. Transactions for loose-leaf pearl tea and Mei tea were sporadic, with selling prices also being favorable.</p>
<h3>Seafood, New Crops Poor, Dried Shrimp, Dried Silver Fish, All Rise in Price</h3>
<p>New Dried Shrimp: According to news from Ningbo, the third batch of Dragon Boat Festival catches were poor due to low salinity, resulting in very few catches. Currently, fishermen from Daishan, Zhoushan, and Shengshan are holding onto the previous catches and not selling them, so few goods are arriving in this port, causing market prices to rise. Current market prices are around 24 to 25 yuan, and the goods are oily and lacking in clean, high-quality product. Stored old goods are taking the opportunity to rise, with selling prices at 33 to 34 yuan. New Yantai shrimp, the previously arrived goods have already been sold out. Yesterday, another 28 packages arrived, with large pieces priced at 49 yuan and medium pieces at 45 yuan. Demand is extremely brisk, and goods are sold immediately upon arrival. New Jiangbei shrimp are selling for 43 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Guangdong Sugar Auction Volume Increases</h3>
<p>Chao Jing Brown Sugar Rises Two or Three Dimes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable. Public association prices, such as those for No. 24 coarse white and No. 489 Dong White spot and transit goods, remained unchanged, with few buyers and a weak market. Cotton white sugar from the local factory, Zhenji No. 1, was 20 yuan and 3 dimes, and Dahua Jinxin No. 1 was 20 yuan and 5 dimes, with the remainder unchanged. Prices from domestic sugar refineries remained strong. Chao sugar sellers offered over 100 packages of Zhiyang white sugar at 13 yuan and 2 dimes, and 60 to 70 packages of cotton brown sugar at 12 yuan and 6 dimes to 5 dimes. The Hua sugar sellers offered dozens of packages of Chao Jing sugar at 12 yuan and 2 dimes to 12 yuan, up 2 or 3 dimes. Gongfen white sugar was offered at 17 yuan and 8 dimes, but no sales were made.</p>
<p>The joint-venture company held its second weekly auction yesterday. The total amount of Guangdong white and cotton white sugar was 9,821 packages. The bid prices were unchanged, but transaction volume increased. Transactions included 560 packages of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep white sugar at 21 yuan and 6 dimes, another 904 packages from Dongguan Factory at 21 yuan and 5 dimes, another 510 packages from Shixin Factory at 21 yuan and 6 dimes, another 15 packages from Quxi Factory at 21 yuan and 3 dimes, 20 packages of medium grain white sugar at 19 yuan and 3 dimes, 50 packages of No. 2 cotton white sugar at 20 yuan and 6 dimes, and 100 packages of No. 4 cotton white sugar at 20 yuan and 4 dimes.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, New Haikou Lychees Arrive Gradually</h3>
<p>New Zhangzhou Lychees Will Also Arrive in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new dried lychees, such as Black Leaf and Dachao varieties from Guangdong, the prices for the first two batches were relatively stable. The third batch of over two hundred boxes has continued to arrive, with prices opening at 34 yuan and 5 dimes to 22 yuan, down 3 to 4 yuan. It is reported that merchants have also discounted prices. The third batch of over one thousand five hundred boxes of Haikou lychees is said to be en route and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Market conditions may continue to ease. The first batch of dried Bao Ye and Zao Hong lychees from Zha Zhou is expected to arrive in about ten days. Due to the earlier price drop in Guangdong goods, the initial price of Zhangzhou lychees may be difficult to sell well.</p>
<p>Due to a long absence of new arrivals, Sun-dried Shi Ma has been out of stock in Shanghai for some time. Because of the slow sales of the small round grains in the area, production has resumed. Yesterday, it was reported that a certain company in the southern market had two boxes arriving. As there is a shortage of stock, the item is still tightly priced.</p>

<h3>Lu Shangyi and Daughter Defeat Bandits</h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>During the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, there was a commoner in Dayu County, Jiangxi Province, named Lu Shangyi. His family had lived in Nanyuan Mountain for generations. Both he and his wife were skilled in using bird guns.</p>
<p>Nanyuan Mountain was located at the border of Dayu and Chongyi counties, and the land was very fertile. However, due to its high mountains and dense forests, it was a good place for bandits to hide. Some outlaws set up camps there and often harassed and robbed the surrounding villages, causing the nearby people to move away.</p>
<p>However, Lu Shangyi had lived at the foot of Nanyuan Mountain for decades. Although his neighbors had moved away, the bandits could do nothing to him because he and his wife were skilled in using bird guns. Bird guns were, of course, more powerful than swords and spears. Whenever the bandits in the mountains attacked Lu Shangyi, he and his wife would fire their two bird guns continuously and accurately. The bandits could not resist, and many bandits died under the bird guns of Lu Shangyi and his wife every year. The bandits could do nothing to him but hated him to the bone.</p>
<p>In the fortieth year of Kangxi, Bandit King Lan, from Wanhoushan in Guangdong, led more than two hundred followers. Each of them was energetic, fierce like wolves, with swords and spears as fast as lightning, and spears like a forest. They marched mightily through the Dayu Ridge, shouting that they would kill Lu Shangyi in Nanyuan Mountain, tear him to pieces, and avenge the brothers who had been killed by Lu Shangyi over the years.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a garrisoned vice-general stationed in Nan'an, who also had a battalion of soldiers. However, these soldiers only knew how to bully the good and oppress the kind during peacetime. They would not dare to say half a "no" to the big bandits. When they saw Lan's powerful force, they wanted to learn to be like a shrinking turtle, shrinking their heads into their armor, not daring to stick them out even if they were beaten to death. Seeing that the situation was not good, the vice-general dared not hide it and quickly reported it. Chief Commander Yang Jun sent a clerk, unable to contain his anger, and scolded the vice-general severely. He then ordered two garrison commanders to select five hundred elite soldiers and quickly go to Nanyuan Mountain to suppress and capture the bandits.</p>
<p>The two garrison commanders received the order and dared not neglect it. They went to the drill field, selected five hundred elite soldiers, wore helmets and armor, and marched mightily towards Nanyuan Mountain, day and night.</p>
<p>When Bandit King Lan came to seek revenge, Lu Shangyi's wife had already died, leaving only a daughter. The father and daughter lived alone and desolate at the foot of Nanyuan Mountain. Because Lu Shangyi had no son, he treated this daughter as a son, teaching her to use bird guns. The daughter was very clever, and although she was only ten years old, she was already skilled in using bird guns.</p>
<p>Lu Shangyi knew that he had made a great enemy of the bandits. Although the bandits did not dare to provoke him for the time being, they would eventually come to seek revenge. Therefore, he was always on guard.</p>
<p>When Bandit King Lan came this time, he shouted that he would find Lu Shangyi to seek revenge as soon as he crossed the Dayu Ridge. Before he even arrived at Nanyuan Mountain, Lu Shangyi already knew. He became even more careful and told his daughter, "Bandits are coming to seek revenge on me. Don't be afraid. Follow me. We are good at using bird guns, and we will make sure they don't return."</p>
<p>One day, as soon as the sky was bright, Lu Shangyi had already gotten up. With his trained ears, he heard many footsteps in the distance. This was rare in Nanyuan Mountain, and he knew that those coming for revenge had arrived.</p>
<p>Lu Shangyi was a man who had experienced great enemies, and he was very calm in his heart, not flustered at all. He went over and woke his daughter, saying in a low voice, "Daughter, get up, the bandits are here."</p>
<p>The daughter turned over and got up. At first, she was a little flustered, but after seeing Lu Shangyi's calm demeanor, she unconsciously calmed down. Without a word, she slowly got ready, and Lu Shangyi handed her a bird gun.</p>
<p>Lu Shangyi and his daughter each took a bird gun and lay in ambush in front of the gun hole that had already been built, placing the ammunition in the middle of the two. Lu Shangyi's house was built into the cliff, with only one side open, and the gun hole was built on this side. At this time, Bandit King Lan and the more than two hundred followers he brought could already be faintly seen.</p>
<p>Lu Shangyi instructed his daughter again, "Don't panic. Aim accurately before firing. We must take a bandit's life with each bullet. And we must not fire our guns at the same time. We must take turns so we have time to load the ammunition, and the bullets will not run out."</p>
<p>Lan's followers walked to a place not far from the house and, with a shout, pounced on Lu Shangyi's house. Here, Lu Shangyi and his daughter could see clearly, and they fired their guns together. In the smoke, several bandits in the front row had already fallen. However, these followers were not afraid of death and continued to shout and rush forward. Lu Shangyi and his daughter's guns were also fired continuously, with bullets raining down, causing dust to fill the sky and the sound to be like thunder. After fighting for a long time, over fifty of Lan's followers had already died, and many were wounded. Lan himself was also wounded. Unable to withstand it, they retreated.</p>
<p>Seeing that the bandits had retreated, Lu Shangyi continued to watch closely until they could no longer be seen before putting down his bird gun and exhaling a long breath. His daughter also put down her bird gun.</p>
<p>By the time the two garrison commanders led five hundred elite soldiers to Nantan Mountain, Bandit King Lan had already been defeated by Lu Shangyi. However, these bandits had not left and were all hiding in Nanyuan Mountain. The paths in Nanyuan Mountain were complicated, and there were many trees. The soldiers did not dare to go into the mountains to search, saying, "The bandits are in the dark, and we are in the open. If we go in, we will suffer."</p>
<p>Lu Shangyi could not bear it and went to the two garrison commanders, saying, "It's okay. I know the roads well. Follow me, and we can definitely catch the bandits."</p>
<p>With Lu Shangyi volunteering, the two garrison commanders also gained courage and led five hundred elite soldiers into the mountains with Lu Shangyi. Not far into the mountains, Lu Shangyi, with his sharp eyes, saw bandits lying in ambush in the deep grass. He raised his bird gun, aimed, and fired. With a "whoosh" sound, he shot down several bandits. The remaining bandits were all startled and ran away, climbing over mountains and ridges. The government soldiers were still timid, and seeing the bandits run, they dared not chase them. They only took the three abandoned sand cannons back to report their achievements.</p>
<p>From then on, the reputation of Lu Shangyi and his daughter shook Dayu and Chongyi counties.</p>
<p>The territory of Dayu and Chongyi counties was mostly mountainous, making it easy to hide bandits. Most of these bandits were afraid of Lu Shangyi. Therefore, Chongyi County Magistrate Gao Shangying invited Lu Shangyi to the yamen, prepared a feast, and sent him a lot of silver, intending to appoint Lu Shangyi as a constable. At the same time, Dayu County Magistrate also invited Lu Shangyi, doing the same, also intending to appoint him as a constable. The two county magistrates argued with each other, unable to resolve the issue, and even sent official documents to Nan'an Prefecture to argue. Lu Shangyi was truly popular.</p>
<p>However, Lu Shangyi had a solution. He refused the appointment from both counties, saying to the two county magistrates, "I am a farmer and do not want to be a constable. However, I live at the border of the two counties, and I dare not disobey the orders of the two counties' officials to maintain local peace. However, I can still help without being a constable. My daughter and I live in the Nanyuan Mountain area, and the bandits will not dare to come. If there are bandits in the two counties' territory in the future, and the government soldiers want to suppress them, I will definitely follow them. When I arrive, the bandits will naturally run away."</p>
<p>The two county magistrates were very happy and sent Lu Shangyi many things, allowing him to return to Nanyuan Mountain.</p>
<p>When the bandits in Guangdong heard that Bandit King Lan had suffered such a big setback, they no longer dared to harass the Nan'an Prefecture.</p>
<h3>Einstein</h3>
<p>— Albert Einstem, Huashu Lun</p>
<p>Newton believed that space and time were absolute, but three hundred years after Newton, Einstein negated him, believing instead that space and time were entirely relative, with nothing being absolute. A simple analogy from Fei Xiangjun's translated "Popular Relativity" (published by The Commercial Press) can be cited to illustrate: When we say that the time it takes to travel from Hangzhou to Beijing is very long, that length is naturally a comparison, meaning that the time from Hangzhou to Beijing is longer than from Hangzhou to Shanghai; similarly, when we say that Mount Tai is very large, it means that the space occupied by Mount Tai is much larger than that of smaller mountains elsewhere... This shows that our measurements of time, the size of things, etc., do not have absolute standards. As for the theory of relativity, it is extremely difficult, and Einstein's discovery is merely to seek the truth in science. (Although, truth is precisely the foundation of practicality.) Here, we will only introduce Einstein's experiences and personality.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, a city on the upper reaches of the Danube in southern Germany. He was of Jewish descent, his father being a businessman. Six weeks after his birth, his father moved the entire family to Munich to co-operate with his uncle in the then-emerging business of electrical factories. He grew up surrounded by a scientific atmosphere, but although he achieved fame in his later years, he never had a good impression of Munich, as he first experienced the suffering of a Jew in Germany when he started school there.</p>
<p>His mathematical talent was evident and precocious from a young age. At thirteen, he taught himself elementary geometry textbooks and was deeply impressed by the deductive beauty of geometry's system. Later (in 1932), when lecturing at Oxford University on the methods of theoretical physics, he said that if someone reading Euclid for the first time is unmoved by the beauty of its structure, they are not suitable to discuss theoretical physics. However, after leaving secondary school, his enthusiasm for mathematics transformed into a passion for physics. Physics was not only the goal of his entire research, but he also believed he could gain a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics within it.</p>
<p>At seventeen, he entered the Zurich Polytechnic in Switzerland to study. From the hundred francs of tuition sent by his parents each month, he saved twenty francs as savings to obtain Swiss citizenship, so he had to be particularly frugal in his living expenses. This led to malnutrition at the time, which sowed the seeds for gastrointestinal problems in later years. Nevertheless, during his time at the Polytechnic, he still frequented the opera house to satisfy his love for music.</p>
<p>After graduating from university in 1900, he wanted to live independently and become a secondary school teacher. At the same time, his family also hoped he would find a position to supplement the family's finances. However, only Swiss citizens could be regular teachers in Swiss secondary schools, and he was not yet qualified at that time, so he had to temporarily remain unemployed. Later, he obtained a temporary position at a vocational school and then responded to an advertisement seeking a private tutor in the Schaffhausen area. Soon after, he resigned because the employer disliked his liberal ideas.</p>
<p>In 1902, through the introduction of a classmate's father, he joined the patent office in Bern, the Swiss capital, as a technician, and officially obtained Swiss citizenship.</p>
<p>He served diligently in the patent office, carefully examining various new inventions, while often stealing time to do various calculations and research. As soon as he heard the director's footsteps, he would hurriedly hide compasses, rulers, and the like into the drawers of his file cabinet.</p>
<p>Starting the year before joining the patent office, he continuously published papers in "Ann. d. Phys" (a prestigious German academic journal with a history of over a hundred years), all on thermodynamics, molecular theory, and the then-emerging statistical mechanics. Among them, a paper published on May 11, 1905, attracted much attention, which was a theoretical explanation for the Brownian motion phenomenon discovered by Brown. Robert Brown discovered under a microscope in 1827 that very small particles are constantly moving in liquids, but he could not explain this constant movement of small particles that were just visible under a microscope, and it remained an unsolved mystery in the scientific community. Einstein's theory was that heat can increase the activity of molecules. He also listed some equations, trying to deduce collective behavior from molecular activity. These papers, in fact, laid the foundation for Einstein's position in the academic world.</p>
<p>In the same year, while at the patent office, he published his Special Theory of Relativity. After its publication, Professor Plank, an old physicist in Berlin at the time, was the first to recognize its significance and immediately wrote to commend it.</p>
<p>Starting in the winter semester of 1909, Einstein served as a special lecturer at his alma mater. At this time, his social status had suddenly increased, but his private life was still often spent pushing a baby carriage leisurely on the street. By this time, he already had two children.</p>
<p>Einstein was then hired by the University of Prague in the Czech Republic to teach, serving for just over a year, until the autumn of 1912 when he returned to the Zurich Polytechnic as a full professor. Madame Curie and the French mathematician Henri Poincaré strongly recommended him for this position. Poincaré, when attending a popular science lecture in Berlin in the autumn of 1910 on the new mechanics, strongly stated that Einstein's theory of relativity was a major revolution in mechanics since Newton.</p>
<p>Originally, Newton's law of universal gravitation, although it had dominated the world for hundreds of years, could not explain the movement of Mercury. Mercury should orbit the sun according to its orbit, but its starting and ending points were not in the same place. It always took a little longer to complete a full orbit. Although Newton's theory could not explain this orbital anomaly, Einstein could explain it almost accurately.</p>
<p>While in Prague, he began his most famous research, which was the problem of the path taken by light. It was previously believed that light was not composed of material molecules, so it would travel in a straight line in a vacuum, unaffected by gravity. But Newton's theory believed that when light passed close to the sun, it would become curved, as if light were composed of matter. However, according to Einstein's theory, this light would bend twice as much as Newton's law predicted.</p>
<p>When this theory was published, because it was too novel and too different from the old theories, it naturally aroused opposition from general stubborn scholars, with the contemporary physicist Arbrecht being particularly opposed. On the other hand, young British astronomer Eddington gave a comprehensive report on Einstein's general theory of relativity at the London Physical Society. At that time, Professor Weyl of mathematics at the Zurich Polytechnic also published the famous "Space, Time, Matter" lectures, all of whom were admirers and supporters of Einstein's ideas.</p>
<p>The most powerful confirmation of scientific truth is experimental measurement. This is Bacon's famous saying. In May 1919, the Royal Society of England and the Royal Astronomical Society jointly dispatched observation teams to measure the solar eclipse (total and partial) at that time, divided into two teams, one in northern Brazil and one on Príncipe Island in the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa. Relativity researcher Eddington joined the African team. The day was clear, and the photographs showed the correctness of Einstein's theory. The Brazilian side also verified Einstein's theory based on these photos, using both large and small telescopes. That is, the degree of bending of the light passing by the sun was exactly what Einstein had calculated. On November 6 of the same year, the Royal Astronomical Society in London officially reported and acknowledged it.</p>
<p>At this time, Einstein was in Berlin. He had been appointed a full member of the Prussian Academy and also a professor at the University of Berlin.</p>
<p>At that time, The Times of London was the first to publish the news with the headline "Revolution in Science: New Theory of Space; Overthrow of Newton's Theory of Gravity," and at the same time introduced and explained this emerging theory in detail. However, due to the profoundness and obscurity of this theory, which made it impossible for others to start, they had to ask Einstein himself to come forward.</p>
<p>Einstein once said: "I am afraid there aren't even a dozen people in the world who truly understand this theory." Shaw also called Einstein's genius "lonely" to his face.</p>
<p>In 1912, Einstein was invited to lecture in Paris. At that time, it was just after the end of the Great War, and Einstein was the first German scholar to be invited to France. On the one hand, this aroused resentment in Germany, and in France, it was still dangerous to speak German in Paris at that time. The organizers of Einstein's invitation strongly stated that Einstein was Swiss in order to divert the attention of the French. The French were initially skeptical of Einstein's theory, but once they saw Einstein's demeanor and speech in person, the misunderstanding was swept away. The famous politician and mathematician Paul Painlevé was one of them.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he was invited to England, and then crossed the ocean to Japan to give academic lectures. This humble and peaceful old scholar gradually met with the world in this way.</p>
<p>His thinking was peace-loving. He believed that peace was the absolute ideal of mankind and advocated the same in politics. Therefore, in the spring of 1914, when the Great War broke out, he remained in his laboratory amidst the surrounding excitement, absorbed in research work, and completed the general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>In March 1929, for Einstein's fiftieth birthday, a grand celebration was held in Berlin, but the birthday celebrant secretly avoided it and went to a humble house by a small lake outside Berlin to live a self-sufficient life. A clever American reporter found him there but was met with cold looks and had an unpleasant experience. A few days later, when he returned home, congratulatory telegrams from all sides, friends, scholars, societies, schools, and acquaintances had piled up on the table, and the most moving among them was the money given by a poor worker. He said that Einstein was a kind and great man, and he gave some of his meager savings to Einstein to pay for cigarettes to express his love and respect. Einstein, in his busy schedule, immediately replied to him first. These things show how humble and averse to vanity he was.</p>
<p>He was also very enthusiastic about Jewish issues. Sometimes, to help poor Jews, he personally played his favorite violin to raise money for relief.</p>
<p>In addition to his love of music, rowing was also one of his specialties.</p>
<p>Einstein traveled to the United States three times, all in response to invitations from the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. From October 1933, he was hired as the head of the mathematics department at The Institute for Advanced Study (a new type of academy resembling a research institute) in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
<p>After Hitler came to power, because of the so-called anti-Jewish movement, Einstein's property was confiscated, and his residence was searched, forcing Einstein to leave Germany. On March 28, 1933, he officially notified his resignation from the Prussian Academy; Einstein would generally never return to the embrace of Germany. On September 18 of the same year, the eighth German Physics Society held a meeting in Berlin, and the speech by the famous conservative physicist Max von Laue can very well illustrate the German academic community's feelings about Einstein's departure. He said: "June 22 this year was the 300th anniversary of Galileo's trial for his heliocentric theory. The significance of this trial need not be elaborated. Unexpectedly, today in the 20th century, we still see a situation similar to that trial, that is, the discrimination against the theory of relativity." The implication is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "Wang Zhu" in the 13th issue of this publication on June 11, the character "Zhu" in the title and the text was mistakenly printed as "Xie." It should be corrected immediately.</p>

<h3>Youth Readings in Times of National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is currently facing an unprecedented period of national crisis. All aspects, including politics, economics, military affairs, and education, should adapt to the needs of this period. The reforms in politics, economics, and military affairs in recent months, if carefully analyzed, reveal their serious and great significance. In the past, the educational authorities convened experts to discuss national crisis education plans, with the sole purpose of connecting with politics and establishing the central goal of education in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>Our publishing industry should also establish a central policy at this time that meets the needs of the national crisis period. It is not only the publishing industry that should have this awareness, but I think the general readers are also eagerly anticipating it!</p>
<p>Among all publications, young people are the largest patrons. On the one hand, many young people are still in school, and their time and finances allow them to read. At the same time, young people have a relatively strong desire for knowledge. Therefore, youth readings are abundant in the current publishing market.</p>
<p>We know that young people are the soul of the nation and the backbone of the country. Especially in this critical time for the nation's survival, the important task of revitalizing the nation rests on the shoulders of young people. Therefore, the magnitude of the responsibility borne by young people is self-evident.</p>
<p>Since the mission of young people is so important, then the importance of youth readings, which are the spiritual food of young people, is of course self-evident.</p>
<p>But let's take a look at the current state of youth readings circulating on the market. If Publisher A publishes a book of youth letters, Publisher B will publish a book of a few letters from youth. If this publisher publishes a book on youth cultivation, that publisher will publish a book on youth training. The content is all the same, and they say nothing more than those few sentences. Some books even inject bad ideas into the minds of young people, leading young people down the wrong path. Reading such books is naturally more harmful than beneficial!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current stage of national crisis, we should liquidate the past youth readings and conduct a serious review. For the compilation and writing of current youth readings, we should establish a goal. We will talk about liquidating the past when there is an opportunity in the future. Now, let's talk about what kind of youth readings we need in this unprecedented period of national crisis.</p>
<p>First, we should establish a central consciousness. The reason why many past youth readings have failed to achieve great results is mainly because they lacked the dominance of a central idea. In this period of national crisis, we need unified thinking and unified steps. In this way, we will have strength externally and the assurance of victory. In addition to making preparations in politics, economics, and military affairs, we also need a total mobilization of consciousness! Therefore, unifying the thinking of young people and gathering them under the same goal is the most urgent and necessary task in the current stage. As for what is the central guidance for young people during the national crisis period, this is something that needs to be discussed by experts to determine an outline.</p>
<p>Second, we should instill knowledge of the national crisis. Our nation is in an unprecedented period of national crisis, and young people should be prepared for mobilization at any time. Therefore, clear knowledge of national defense knowledge and military knowledge is naturally required. For example, our national defense line is in what place, what is the crisis of national defense, our country's resources, population, and various wartime knowledge, and air defense common sense are all things that young people urgently need to understand.</p>
<p>The establishment of a central consciousness is a spiritual construction movement. The instillation of national crisis knowledge belongs to the scientific and technological aspects. With a unified spirit, we can effectively apply knowledge and technology to wage a lasting war!</p>
<h3>On Extraordinary Fiscal Policy</h3>
<p>— Shen Lin</p>
<p>Written by Yin Wenjing, Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Due to the perilous international situation, the outbreak of a second world war is imminent. On the eve of humanity facing another disaster, how should China's extraordinary fiscal policy be managed? Regarding this question, there is a large number of works and translations of "Wartime Economics" on the publishing market, which is unfortunately very incomplete. Most translations focus on one country, and can only serve as reference material with little relevance. As for the scattered articles, they are often vague and emphasize the compilation of historical materials while neglecting the establishment of arguments based on the current situation. To enable the people of the country to conduct a reasonable review of the finances of this extraordinary period, Yin Wenjing's "On Extraordinary Fiscal Policy" was published. The reporter believes that this is a good book. Whether for those who are new to the study of fiscal policy or those who are well-versed in it, they can have a bird's-eye view of the historical environment and understand China's posture.</p>
<p>In the preface, Mr. Yin tells us the reasons why we should study extraordinary fiscal policy: "...However, even if we do not participate in the war, we cannot avoid challenges from others, and we must prepare for defense in advance. As the saying goes, 'A country that does not compete will also be bullied. What kind of country is that?' Moreover, extraordinary fiscal policy is not limited to the period of warfare and warring countries. International politics and economics are closely related. It is not necessary for us to meet others on the battlefield to be affected by war and to prepare for wartime. Even when other countries are at war with each other, we will still feel threatened, and our fiscal and financial systems will be thrown into a panic. More than 80 percent of China's fiscal revenue depends on consumption tax, and customs duties account for the largest part of it. This kind of tax revenue is extremely susceptible to the influence of international wars and will decrease. On the other hand, the government's place for financing is only the tottering Shanghai financial market, which is also in danger of collapsing immediately in the event of war. How will China's finances be during wartime? It's really unbearable to think about! This is why we want to study extraordinary fiscal policy." As for the main points in the theory of extraordinary fiscal policy, the author pointed out: "The extraordinary period referred to in this book includes the fiscal handling during wartime and before and after the war. At the same time, the current fiscal panics and coping methods of various countries will also be answered and analyzed one by one."</p>
<p>The content of this book is divided into ten chapters: The first chapter is an explanation of the meaning and phenomenon of general fiscal policy, and chapters two, three, and four are general descriptions of the essence of extraordinary fiscal policy, as well as a narrative of the ways to raise war expenses during wartime. The historical investigation and theoretical discussion of paper money, taxes, public debts, and conscription in the First World War are all thoroughly analyzed. The last two chapters summarize the finances of various countries under extraordinary conditions and the current stage of Chinese finance. The author believes that China's finances have long entered an extraordinary stage, and the degree is no less than that of various countries after the war, and the danger is even greater. He said: "But when it comes to the conditions of extraordinary fiscal policy, none of them are available. In terms of income, it can be asserted that tax revenue is insufficient to meet expenditure needs, and the usual principle of determining expenditure based on income cannot be realized. Moreover, the tax system is extremely deformed, with almost all of the burden being borne by the propertyless masses. In recent years, due to the vigorous implementation of tax increases and the impact of economic panic, the tax base has been unable to bear the burden and is gradually drying up. Once a war occurs, or the panic intensifies, its depletion can be expected immediately. This is something that deserves the most attention. In terms of expenditure, it is impossible to realize the principle of determining expenditure based on income because various expenses cannot be saved. Moreover, the proportion of military debt expenses is too large, making finances too extraordinary. Therefore, there is no choice but to have a huge accumulation of public debt. The higher the debt, the greater the expenditure on debt service; the more military expenses, or the more frequent domestic wars; finances will inevitably decline. In other respects, such as the unsound financial organization, the uncertain monetary system, and the daily decline of the national economy, all of which are sufficient to affect finances."</p>
<p>In the conclusion of the final paragraph, the author prescribes the right medicine and proposes three ways of reform: First, in terms of taxation, a complete tax system should be established, and a strong customs policy should be established. Second, in terms of expenditure, the scope of extraordinary expenditure should be reduced as much as possible, and we hope to advocate thrift in society. Third, in terms of currency and finance, we should immediately discuss concrete measures with the relevant countries and not allow it to deteriorate naturally. If the authorities can put these three items into practice, then the future of finance can be hoped for!</p>

<h3>Suzhou Anti-Rent Riot</h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>When the Suzhou anti-rent riot first broke out, the media unanimously requested the Changshu Bureau not to act too rashly and adopt high-pressure tactics. Because this kind of incident cannot be resolved by compulsory methods. The situation later eased slightly, and we were gratified to think that if we could take advantage of the situation to guide and persuade the farmers and find another reasonable way, the incident could achieve very good results. However, on the 26th of last month, there was a news item in the newspaper saying that Suzhou forced the payment of rent, and there was a conflict between the security team and the farmers, resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>People's resistance to rent is, of course, a violation of the law, which should be prohibited, but we cannot simply treat it as an illegal event and deal with it rigidly according to the law. Instead, we must understand its causes and adapt our measures to the circumstances. Are the farmers of Suzhou really stubborn and unwilling to abide by the law? Why, after paying land rent year after year for hundreds of years, are they now unwilling to pay it? Newspapers have repeatedly pointed out that the main cause of this trend is that there have been disasters of insects and drought over the years, resulting in poor harvests. Farmers have difficulty even taking care of their own food and clothing, so how can they still have the resources to pay land rent? Just look at how many starving people there are in today's paradise of Suzhou? Even selling children cannot maintain their livelihood. Moreover, the entire rural economy is collapsing, and resources are exhausted. Even if there are goods, they cannot be sold. What are they supposed to take out? In addition, the collection method adopted by the authorities, "reducing the tax by map," is also inappropriate. Furthermore, listening to the words of the owners and forcing the tenants to pay rent only increases the farmers' anger.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with the remedial measures put forward in various reports. Fundamentally, we must seek the revival of the entire Chinese countryside. This is a major prerequisite. We are very happy to hear that the authorities are now putting forward the slogan of reviving the countryside. But we hope that we can really do it in a solid way.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Lida Horticultural Farm in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Last time, after visiting the Lida Chicken Farm in Jiangwan, I became very interested in rural sideline occupations. At the same time, I learned that in addition to the chicken farm, Lida Academy also has a horticultural farm and a rural service department in Nanxiang. Therefore, I really wanted to find an opportunity to visit there as well. However, due to busy work, it was delayed until now.</p>
<p>Taking the small train to Nanxiang, I inquired about the address of the Lida Horticultural Farm in the town. I learned that it was not in Nanxiang, but in Chaitang Township, eight miles away from Nanxiang, which is under the jurisdiction of Nanxiang. Starting from the train station, the Suhu Highway can lead directly to Chaitang, without</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>turning corners, making it very easy to remember. Because I wanted to inspect the countryside along the way, I walked there. However, when I reached Fengjia Bridge, it started to drizzle. And it became heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>It was difficult to see the outline of the Lida Horticultural Farm emerging from the dense jungle. As I reluctantly stepped under the corridor of their office, the rain poured down like a waterfall.</p>
<p>I explained my purpose to a student and asked him to inform Director Zhang here. The student agreed and left, asking us to sit in the reading room for a while. Soon, he came and led us to the central office. Director Zhang greeted us very modestly and told us everything in detail.</p>
<p>He said: This place is also affiliated with Shanghai Lida Academy. Although the surrounding area has more than 800 mu of land (leased), only more than 40 mu have been cultivated. Among these 40 mu, except for the 20 mu that have been developed into fish ponds, the rest are planted with flowers, fruit trees, vegetables, etc. There is a senior high school rural education department and a complete primary school. The senior high school rural education department does not charge tuition. Each semester, it only charges 58 yuan for food, miscellaneous fees, and all compensation fees. However, students must live on-site and practice in the farm. After three years of graduation, they either stay in the farm to serve or go to work on other farms.</p>
<p>This department currently only has 40 students. The complete primary school section now has more than 200 students, all of whom are children from nearby farm families. Tuition is slightly charged here.</p>
<p>The curriculum in the senior high school rural education department is currently tentatively designed to include three types: agronomy, animal husbandry, and rural counseling. They are now trying to gradually expand other necessary academic subjects.</p>
<p>After a while, the rain stopped, and Mr. Zhang led me around to visit for a week.</p>
<p>The environment here is very quiet, and the scenery is very beautiful. The lush green trees are full of rural flavor. In the center are two flat houses. One on the right is the student dormitory, worker’s quarters, and farm tool room. The one on the left, in addition to an office, a library, and a reading room, there are also two teacher’s lounges. The far left is the primary school department and the post office box. In front is a large fish pond, and behind is a lotus pond. Across a small bridge, there is a secret clinic, next to which is a small chicken farm. In front of the chicken farm are two plant hotbeds and a plant greenhouse.</p>
<p>Regarding crops, the fruit tree section has more than ten varieties of vegetables, fruits, grapes, apples, peaches (now fruiting, wrapped in paper bags to prevent insect damage), etc. The horticulture section, in addition to all kinds of flowers and potted plants, also has various melons and vegetables. Lotus flowers and arrowhead are planted in the lotus pond. The animal husbandry section only has a few types such as bees, pigeons, and chickens.</p>
<p>They have also made many contributions to the local rural area. For example, they found that the local cotton varieties were not good, so they purchased many improved varieties and distributed them to local farmers, teaching them to try planting. If the results are good, they plan to generally promote the planting of improved cotton.</p>
<h3>The Poisoned</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>Old Yu is back from Nankou. What makes me very strange is that Old Yu has completely changed. He used to be strong and lively, but now he is the opposite, thin and only skin and bones left. His eyes are deeply sunken, without any blood color; the color of his whole body is only pale, a deathly gray pale; he has changed, he has completely changed.</p>
<p>In my heart, it is like carrying an incomprehensible mystery. I haven’t seen him for three years, and he has changed so quickly, unexpectedly.</p>
<p>He came yesterday, panting like a chronically ill old man. He grabbed me tightly with his two trembling hands, but I felt his hands were icy and weak. He smiled, also so reluctantly. In short, I felt estranged from everything about him, as if I had never come into contact with such a person, such a terrible stranger.</p>
<p>"Hello!... " he said weakly, looking at me with those deeply sunken and lifeless eyes. I didn't say anything, just nodded.</p>
<p>"Huh!... (He gave a bitter smile), do you find it strange? You would never dream that I would become like this, huh! But I don't find it strange at all, because I have seen too many people like me, sigh!... What's so strange about it!... "</p>
<p>He gasped, his voice a little disconnected. His face was convulsing in waves of pain. He wanted to cough, he raised his trembling hand and weakly beat his sunken chest. At that time, I seemed to have lost consciousness, and felt that what was in front of me was a spiritual illusion. I carefully paid attention to his every small movement, and I listened to him continue to speak.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, Lao Yang, (He raised his voice, I, I have been poisoned! Poisoned! There is no cure! I am already a useless person..."</p>
<p>"What?" Poisoned?...</p>
<p>"Huh! So terrible, so terrible!... Damn poisonous policy! Humph, (He punched the table, his eyes angry, as if he wanted to tear some monster apart. He clenched his thin fist forcefully.)… It’s over, this life is over like this! (His voice dropped.)</p>
<p>He slowly tilted his body again and took out a package from his pocket.</p>
<p>"Look, this is it! This is a kind of white powder, the most fierce kind... Humph!... Damn... ah..." He leaned softly on the back of the chair, as if overwhelmed by fatigue.</p>
<p>"How could you, would you learn to do this kind of thing? Can the bureau..."</p>
<p>"How would you know, huh! The methods of the ×× people, the Korean sticks, are very many... First, they give it to you, saying it can cure some disease, and try their best to lure you into being fooled. Then you accept it. As the days go by, you must be addicted. At that time, I didn't have money to give them. They openly asked the bureau for it, deducting it from my salary... So I also lost my job..." As he spoke, he mixed the white powder into a piece of tin foil for wrapping cigarettes, and roasted it with fire underneath. The white powder immediately melted into water droplets, rolling around like mercury. Then he suddenly poured it into his mouth.</p>
<p>Such a way of eating it really surprised me.</p>
<p>"Huh!... (He said calmly) This, you haven't seen it before! This way of eating is too common in the north, near Nankou! This way of eating is only for the big shots!... Humph..."</p>
<p>"In, in Nankou, there are thousands, tens of thousands, countless people who have been poisoned! There are staff, there are students,... especially the laborers and workers... they are all poisoned! All poisoned!... I understand very well myself, and which poisoned person doesn't understand? But it's too late, too late!... Alas!... Poisonous policy... Humph!..."</p>
<p>His voice was so low, so sad, that he actually shed tears!</p>
<p>"If this goes on, in a few years, they will all become useless people..." he said, choking and sadly, and he hit the table with his weak fist, and he fell on the table and cried.</p>
<p>I didn’t say a word, and couldn’t find an appropriate word to comfort him.</p>
<h3>Bombarding Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Chen Li'ang</p>
<p>In the weary body and mind, without the comfort of rest, I quietly miss the old Jiangdi tour again: Bombarding Taiwan. This place once made me excited and shout, and it also made me sad and weep. The stimulation and response given to people may never be harmonious? This place was once full of the joy of love and the expression of natural feelings of living beings, but for a period of time, it was densely covered with the fear of war, and there had been a great massacre of human perversity. There was a bright sun, and there was a violent cyclone. Clear, gloomy, sunny, rainy...? In this era, this place, this environment, who can predict it? Who can say it for sure?</p>
<p>The weather and human affairs are equally unpredictable. When I stepped on the steam car, it was still a blue sky and a bright sun. Unexpectedly, when I got off the car, there was no sunshine to be seen, and the sky became gray. So, I was alarmed and deeply worried... People can never hope that a good time and environment will last forever. Perhaps, at the moment when happiness is coming, disasters have already attacked from the horizontal or from behind. A昙花, a beautiful dream, a streak of colorful clouds... all are viewed and thought of in this way. On the cinder road from the station to Bombarding Taiwan, although there are the sweet words and smiles of young men and women, the songs of elementary school students, and the ridiculousness of the dissolute forms of several foreign men and women, my heart became more and more depressed.</p>
<p>The shape of the fort is still the old look of the Songhu battle. The high earthen mounds, the lookout towers built of green stacked bricks, the long rows of wooden stakes and the barbed wire with sharp thorns, and the moats surrounding the earthen mounds, they contain a sense of solemnity from the frustration of failure, and the impression and stimulation given to me are still a mixture of excitement and sorrow, and coupled with the reaction of the gloomy weather, the surroundings become even more gloomy, repeating the tragic iron and blood of a few years ago. My pace slowed, almost stopping. My blood became feverish, almost gathering in my heart and exploding. At this time, I could no longer hear the sweet words, the smiles, the songs, and the dissolute forms. In my heart, I was seeking, seeking a clear bugle call to break through the current darkness.</p>
<p>Gradually, I also understood myself: I was overly emotionally impulsive, which was useless to my weary body and mind. I quickly freed myself from painful emotions. When I calmed down and carefully browsed the current scene, the sun emerged from a large patch of gray clouds, and the germination of spring grass and trees gave me a powerful indication. I remember the last time I came, it was in the withered and dead winter, but now the willows on the earthen mounds have sprouted new green, all fluttering in the wind, and the dandelions are bright yellow and upright, blooming all over the old site of the fort that had been severely damaged. A blade of grass, a pair of flying birds, a song of a guard, all contain a smile of prosperity.</p>
<p>I walked straight along the long stone road sandwiched between the green grass, and the depression, sadness, and emptiness disappeared. In the wandering of the spring breeze, I often gave the guards a respectful smile. Sometimes, I could also see the rusted cannon barrels and cannon bases through the collapsed breached wall. These dilapidated relics do not need to be bitterly recalled. Our generation needs new bulwarks... I ran up the high embankment and looked at the surging waters of the Yangtze River, the brown sails, and a wisp of black smoke trailing behind the wheel.</p>
<p>On the grass beach, many elementary school students were singing: "—Da—jia—yi—tong—xiang—qian—".</p>
<h3>Fountain Pen</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Six years ago, in the spring, I was studying at an English vocational school on the banks of Suzhou River. It was then that I bought a fountain pen. The name of the pen was "Conklin", which was quite popular at that time. Because it was the first time I used a fountain pen, I was not used to it. When I was lying on the table and writing an article properly, I used a wooden pen holder, and the nib was bought with three copper coins. But I felt that it was far better than the fountain pen.</p>
<p>However, my fountain pen was not completely useless to me. When I was bored in class, or sitting blankly at the table and unable to dispel loneliness, I often took out a piece of white paper and scribbled some incoherent words on it. In this way, many difficult times were buried under this fountain pen.</p>
<p>In autumn, the fountain pen was often by my side. I no longer felt its strangeness, and I was able to use it skillfully. At night, leaning on the window of the third floor, looking at the autumn scenery of the night, the scattered lights, the sad cries of the migratory geese flying over the roof, and the rapidly fleeting shooting stars all made me feel bottomless loneliness. So I quietly spread the paper and wrote silently with my fountain pen, writing my loneliness, writing my sadness. All the hidden injuries and annoyances in my heart, I naturally spit out on the paper with the help of the fountain pen. So the foundation of my emotion with it was very solid. I can't live without it, and it occupies an extremely important position in my life path.</p>
<p>In the past five or six years, for the sake of loneliness and sorrow, the words spit out under this fountain pen have been uncountable. Last autumn, I left the city and came to the countryside to teach. The unified follower was this fountain pen. However, the environment no longer allowed me to wander in loneliness and sorrow. The courses I taught were also the most difficult Chinese language, so most of my time was eroded by course papers and notes. I used a brush again, so I rarely had the opportunity to hold a fountain pen. It wasn't until I woke up in the middle of the night, the cold moon shone through the window, and a breeze blew past the old cypress tree in front of the window that I could no longer sleep, so I picked up my fountain pen and wrote one or two short articles. However, I have not forgotten it, but like a lover I cannot see often, my love for it has a few points of sentimentality.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was dizzy from being tired of course papers and other things, and I finally lost the fountain pen. I tried my best to find it, but it was nowhere to be found. Now it's time to wake up from the dream, where can I find this good lover who has shared weal and woe with me for the past five or six years? Recalling the events in the dream, there are thousands of ends, only leaving behind a sense of disappointment that has no place to settle. Its disappearance is proof of my carelessness, and who else but me should bear this guilt.</p>
<p>The loss of the fountain pen was two weeks ago, and its failure to return is an undeniable fact. But what can fill the emptiness in my heart? I miss it, and this missing is getting stronger and stronger, making it impossible for me to feel relieved for a moment. Loneliness and sorrow have not yet died in my heart, and because of the loss of the fountain pen, this loneliness and this sorrow are attacking me even more. I want to pick up my pen and write my loneliness, write my sorrow, but I am no longer used to the steel nib of three copper coins. There is no way, I have to borrow a fountain pen to write. When I spread the paper and hold the pen, I seem to hear the lost fountain pen saying in a accusing tone: "I only see the new people laugh, but I don't hear the old people cry?" In fact, how can I be happy, I am missing that fountain pen, that fountain pen has my blood and tears on it.</p>
<p>Every lonely morning, every dim dusk, I carry boundless sorrow and hope hopelessly, hoping that one day that fountain pen will drift back.</p>

<p>That kind of life is really unbearable! Even in the simple minds of the farmers, they feel the pain of oppression and become dissatisfied.</p>
<p>And that was a rare good year!</p>
<p>Jinbao's father owed money to Shao Boqing, the steward of the landlord, and was forced by Shao to cut off all the grain. But Zhou Guangyan is a tenant farmer. If he does not have grain to pay rent, he will inevitably be arrested by the landlord to face a lawsuit, because the Bao Wei Tuan and others are just the landlord's henchmen. So Zhou Guangyan had to reluctantly plan to marry Jinbao to Jin Hanting, the son of the landlord, as a concubine.</p>
<p>But Jinbao's lover is the young farmer Yunge. They have been playing together since childhood; and now they live in the same oppressed environment.</p>
<p>That day, Yunge brought a basket of sweet potatoes to Guangyan; and explained his intention to propose marriage to Guangyan. But he was driven away by Guangyan. Guangyan thought that Yunge "is also living from day to day. Whether he can support you in the future is still unknown; and he may not be able to help me get through this year's difficulties." He certainly refused to freely marry Jinbao to Yunge, ruining his deal with the landlord.</p>
<p>However, what made Guangyan difficult was that Jinbao was unwilling to be a commodity to complete his father's poor deal.</p>
<p>At that time, the flower drum singer came and told about the tragic bankruptcy of the countryside.</p>
<p>The carpenter Qian Baokun also ran over and reported that the road route of the highway must demolish Guangyan's house. He went to the head of the surveying team of the highway bureau to intercede, and the surveying team leader asked him for 100 yuan for activity expenses. - But where did Guangyan have 100 yuan?</p>
