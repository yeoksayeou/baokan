<h3 id="c28">西班牙左翼內閣之成立 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>此决西班牙衆議院改選結果左翼各黨佔有二百三十七議席大獲勝利消息發表以後全國政治頓入緊張狀態法西斯軍人領袖有密謀起事之舉中央派自由黨領袖伐拉達萊斯所領導之內閣亦因受總選結果之影響不得不提出總辭職繼之而起者爲左派共和黨領袖所組織之阿薩那內閣新閣頗具左翼共和黨左翼民衆陣錢黨社會黨共產黨聯合色彩爲中小產階層與工農階層混合政權之表現當茲右翼獨裁政治氛圍遍佈全歐之際此一內閣之產生實値得注意者也</p>
<p>吾人欲明瞭此决內閣產生之背景應於西班牙之經濟組織中求之按西班牙之經濟機構頗與革命前之帝俄相似全國土地集中於少數舊日貴族之手至於農民則除佃農與半自耕農外僅就無地可耕之赤貧農民而言人數亦達三百萬以上彼等全賴作大地主之傭工勉强度日自遭世界經濟恐慌浪潮之侵襲農民生活愈益困苦故一九三一年共和政制成立以來西班牙國內之中心問題卽爲如何實現「耕者有其田」之原則蓋一般人民購買力之提高金融情勢之穩定財政收入之增加均以是爲依歸也</p>
<p>農業方面之上項問題乃至難解决者因此而造成之不安狀態波及於工業方面故近年西班牙各地罷工紛擾示威遊行之舉層見迭出在此種情勢之下內閣乃一倒再倒而政黨鬥爭之激化亦成當然之趨勢矣</p>
<p>右派勒樂內閣於去年五月初旬成立後以救濟失業問題絕無辦法引起各處更劇烈騷動於是左翼各黨如社會黨共產黨及工團主義之團體因利害相同目標一致建立統一戰錢同時右翼人民行動黨亦與中央派成立聯盟並公開宣稱「西班牙現所需要者係上帝及爲國家服務之眞實人材右派與中央派之集團政綱爲竭力撲滅發動一九三四年十月叛亂之革命團體」但此種對峙之局右翼陣容究猶不若左翼之整齊也</p>
<p>本屆總選舉左翼各黨之必然獲得勝利固客觀情勢所决定者但此决左翼政權之建立亦尙有其艱困之前途如現任柴麼拉總統被迫辭職則將來之政變勢必難免結果鹿死誰手猶須視英國及歐陸諸列强之態度如何而定如左翼政權竟獲逐漸穩定則最先感受威脅者必爲葡萄牙之軍人獨裁政制影響所及恐歐陸情勢因而發生重大變化亦未可知也</p>

<p>— 中央大學敎授沈剛伯</p>
<p>歷史觀念確定了，就可根據牠去討論方法，中學生不學專門史，也沒有學專門史的工具，用不着那作精深研究的方法。現在姑且提出幾個淺近易行讀敎科書的辦法，或者可以帮助各位預備學校的功課，這法子是要使你們解决歷史上四個W的問題，就是：Who？When？Where？Why？</p>
<p>讀史如同看戲，要懂得一齣戲的情節，先須認淸那生，旦，凈，丑所扮的人物；所以歷史上的人名，是不能不記淸楚的。但是外國名字，譯成中文，老是一長串不相干的字，信屈聱牙，極難記憶。加以繙書的人，各用土昔，譯名絕不統一。譬如那做汽機成功的Wott，北方人譯作「瓦德」，湖南人翻成「華提」，廣柬人更可寫作「屈特」，一個外國人，到有了三四個中國化身，弄得讀者莫名共妙。元朝歷史，就犯這個大病，害得我們到今日還沒有全弄淸楚。現在的西洋史，也是這一點最令學生感覺痛苦。要免這個麻煩，只有記他原來的名字，比記譯名，又正確，又容易。這就是解决第一個W問題Who的辦法。</p>
<p>其次就是When的問題。歷史上一件一件的事情，好比一粒一粒的珠子，年代便是串牠們的一根長錢。若找不着這根綫索，便成了一盤散珠，無從數起。但是那數目字七顚八倒所凑成的年代，實在是難得一一記淸。要是用聯比的方法，就容易多了。聯的法子，就是把每一世紀中的大事，一一注明年代，依次順排下去，記淸某事在先，某事在後——事情的先後，有因果的關係，記起來是容易的。再選一個比較易記的年代，牢牢記住，其他事件的年代，就可以按照先後的决序，推知大槪，縱然不能說出那精確的時日，至少總可指明在某世紀的上半期或下半期，也就勉强可以够用了。比的方法，是將外國的大事名人與同時中國的大事名人，並列起來，拿熟的觀念，去聯絡新的觀念，就容易不忘了。比如說，嬰把兩個有名的羅馬皇帝Trajan同Marius　Aurelius在位的年代——一個是從第一世紀九十八年到一百十七年，一個是自一六一至一八〇——是不大容易。若是記得那征服安息的Trajan正與揚威西域的班定遠同時，那個「哲學皇帝」Awreliws正與我們的大學者蔡邕同時，這樣一比，就不至弄不淸楚他們的時代了。中外眞正的名人有限，最大的事變更不多，費幾天的工夫，就可把一部歷史敎科書上的重要年代，聯比起來，記得一個大概了。</p>
<p>再其决，就是Where的問題。民族的形成，國家的分合，經濟的演變，文化的發展，無一不與地理有密切關係。所以西方有句老話，說：「地理爲歷史之母」，可見學外國史，非明瞭外國地理不可。練習這種知識，有幾種法子；　是將校中所敎的外國地理同外國史，聯合起來，互相印證。　是學歷史的時候，隨時就看歷史地圖，將那疆界的變更，民族的轉徙，交通的路途，同工商業的中心，一一的考察淸楚。好在西洋人沒有常改地名的壞癖氣，千餘年來，大山，大河，通都，大邑的名字，很少變更，不像中國沿革地理那樣難學，只要有現代地理的知識，看古代地圖，是不大難的。　是學畫草圖。每學到一個新的時代，就把那時的地圖，倣畫一張，不必十分精密詳盡，只要描出大概的輪廓就够了。如萬一不能畫圖，至少也得填塡那印好的空白地圖，因爲山川的形勢，疆域的變遷，單靠着圖是記不牢的，動手一畫，自然就熟了。畫張草圖，費時不過二三十分鐘，各中學同學，不能說連這點時候都沒有。</p>
<p>纔所說的，都是考察史實的「當然」。現在要進一步說硏討「所以然」的方法，就是解决Why的問題。人事的變遷，沒有一項是無因而然的，若是找不出牠的原因，便不會眞懂那件事情。空記得情節是無用的，但是人事複雜，不像自然界的現象單簡，往往一件事含着無數的遠因近因，其中有顯而易見的，有隱伏難察的，即顯露出來的，反往往無關重要。我們遇着一件事，務必把牠分析淸楚，抓着那主要的原因，其餘决要的成分，就迎刃而解，就是從略，亦未始不可。譬如說宗敎改革這件大事，表面上看來，好像是由路德幾個人主動，其實敎堂的腐敗，幷不是十六世紀特有的現象，路德的九十五篇文章，更沒有新奇的議論，何至於就能忽然的鼓動全歐呢？那種運動的主要原因，實在宗敎本身以外，有屬於政治的，有屬於經濟的，有屬於文化的，總而言之，乃是民族主義同思想解放的表現。不然，歐洲人何至於傻得爲幾個敎士的爭論去流血咧？再如歐洲大戰，實在是列强的帝國主義同經濟政策必有的結果甚麼「德國是罪魁」，「英國太狡猾」，那一類的話，都是戰時戰後的宜傳文字，全不是眞正的原因。作書的人，不能說沒有人類公有的情感，叙起歷史來，也許不知不覺的，將狹隘的種族的成見，同極端的國家主義的精神，混雜進去。我們讀書的人，須以冷靜的頭腦，細考眞正的因果，干萬不可讓作者引入歧路。</p>
<p>一件一件事情的因果，弄淸楚了，就須進一步考察這件事同那件事的關係。歷史上的事，往往有彼此原不相干，而後忽生關係的，有表面上似不相涉，而實暗受影饗的，若是件件事，都是自爲因果獨自演變，那還成個人類社會嗎？譬如說歐洲大戰，本不是中日交涉的直接原因，但確是大有關係。試問如是歐洲太平，日本人敢提出二十一條嗎？我們要把歷史上種種事變的相互關係，弄明白了，纔能够融會貫通，得一有系統的整個歷史的觀念。</p>
<p>談到整個的歷史，也許有人覺得愈古的事情，愈難了解，愈加看不出牠同現在的關係，這是因爲古人同我們環境不同，心理不同的原故。耍免去道種困難，可以將一部歷史，倒轉過來，由今及古，一步一步的，反看上去，這樣的由近而遠，以今證古，就如同拿着一根有連環的練子，一節一節的依决數上去，自然可以找着牠的源頭了，猶之乎一個人忽然遇見他千年前的祖宗，當時看不出同他一毫相像的地方。若是歷代的祖像，順决排列，從他的祖父起，一個一僩的，倒看上去，就可以發現那一代一代，依决遺傳的神情像貌了。</p>
<p>這解决四個W問題的方法，都是爲個人自修說的，現在再介紹一種令班努力分工合作的辦法。就是請先生將某一時期，或某一國家的歷史，或是某一件大事的經過，分成許多相連貫的子目，每個學生，給他一個，叫他拿下堂去，自由的翻書，看筆記，將那題目做好。上堂時每一點鐘，或是每一星期，抽出幾分鐘，輪流叫個學生，將他預備好的答案，當堂朗誦。然後由先生加以修正補充，其他的同學，就摘要筆記下來，這樣做去，每人每學期至多不過做兩三篇，而所聽到的，倒不下數十百篇，自己不多費光陰，而能得到許多有系統的知識，還不是一件極便易的事嗎？將來一本外國史學完的時候，將這種稿子，加以整理，編訂起來，就可成一本小小的西洋紀事本末，要是做得好的話，還可以出版呢！各位努力吧！　（完）</p>

<p>— 徐均</p>
<p>一，引言</p>
<p>兵器之進步，以弓矢刀矛而至槍砲火藥，更進而飛機炸彈以及毒瓦斯等，日新月異，層出不窮，此皆人類進化，科學昌明使之然也，將來之戰爭，不僅身列疆塲者，有生命之憂，即安居都市者，亦不能脫離危險也。</p>
<p>歐美各國有鑒於斯，凡佔政治，軍事，敎育，經濟，交通，工業等各中心點之市民，對防空防毒之準備，均積極組織與訓練，反觀我國，雖有一二决之演習，當演習時期，表面上之情緒，頗爲緊張，（如宣傳隊之講演，及各報紙之出特刊，與各雜誌之出專號等）迨時期稍過，實際上之工作，則烟消雲散，漠不關心，對防毒防空之文字，亦屬鳳毛麟角，須知防空防毒之問題，非僅某一時期，即可解决，實在平時多加注意也。</p>
<p>二，毒氣之槪念</p>
<p>飛機之威力，固不待言，而毒氣之厲害，對我人烟稠密之市民，有切膚之關係，不可不備有相當之常識也。</p>
<p>所謂毒氣者，並非一種純粹氣體，實包有固體，液體，氣體，而含有毒性之物質也，吾人在硏究毒氣之前，必須對毒氣有一種觀念，更須知毒氣之歷史及其效力之範圍也。</p>
<p>三，毒氣之史略</p>
<p>四千年前，黃帝征蚩允於涿鹿，蚩允作霧以抗戰，其所作之霧，當即爲毒氣之一種，亦即毒氣之肇始，其不能流傳於化，乃在無人繼起硏究也。</p>
<p>紀元前四六年，希臘斯巴達人，用木浸染硫磺與松香，而燃燒之，遂產生惡奧之烟，以熏守城之敵，因以破城焉。</p>
<p>歐戰未發之前，歐美各國，對於毒氣之使用，曾經兩决（一八九八，一九〇七年海牙條的之禁止，但歐戰中期，（一九一五年）德人竟大規模施用，始引起世人之注意焉。</p>
<p>四，毒氣之將來觀</p>
<p>歐戰以還，各國對毒氣戰爭，復有禁用之議，然細加考察，苟一旦戰事發生，對毒氣兵器之使用，决非一紙條的所能限制。</p>
<p>一九二〇年，英國首相，在會議席上，有下列演詞：「在毒氣尙在其他列强武器之列時，吾人對之，絕不能放棄，且毒氣戰鬥隊，現在美，法，意，等國軍隊中，佔一重要部份，並且正在實騐毒氣之實用方法，如我國（英國）竟放棄之，不啻視我國之軍備爲兒戲，就歐戰之經騐而言，作此項胃險，實爲純粹之瘋在也。」</p>
<p>一九二二年，美國化學冶金工程雜誌（Chemical　and　Metallurgical　Engineering）有云：「軍縮會議，禁止毒氣戰爭之决定，僅限於紙上，如再有戰爭發生，利用毒氣作戰，决不能制止，此决會議，未採取毒氣戰爭及製迭毒氣專家之觀點，而僅採取外行的觀點，及一般人民之議論，詆毀毒氣戰爭，爲科學的殘忍及不正當之應用，實乃一大錯誤，對於毒氣，吾人仍當繼續硏究。」</p>
<p>蘇聯軍事理論家富希曼又說：「若是沒有毒氣之戰傭，那末，其國還不配說對於戰爭，有了準備，沒有受過毒氣訓練的軍隊，就不配稱為現代軍。」</p>
<p>根據以上幾點來觀察，將來戰爭，對毒氣之應用，是在所不免的了。</p>
<p>五，毒氣之厲害及其範圍</p>
<p>毒氣效力之大小，當歐戰使用毒氣之幾年中，一般人士對之成具有可怕之觀念，但在大戰吿終，綜合各國士兵因毒氣傷害而致死亡者，平均不過百分之二，因其他兵器傷害而致死亡者，則爲百分之三十，兩兩相較。毒氣之殺人，僅比兵器十五分之一耳。</p>
<p>茲舉毒氣主要用途數點以供研究：　强迫敵人戴面具，以减少敵人戰鬥力。　攻擊敵人陣地或掩體，使敵人不能堅守，勢必放棄。　毒化重要地區，使敵不能佔領與通過。　掩護我軍前進或退却。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>十，髯夏的交通輸運</p>
<p>陸路交通，寗夏公路，幹錢有三，　寗蘭路，　寗包路，　寗平路，寗蘭路自寗夏省城南門起，經寗朔，廣武，棗園，石空，中衛，新堡子，入甘肅靖遠縣境，計長五百二十里，寗包路自寗夏省城北門起，經李岡堡，平羅，石嘴山，渡河經王元地至金寺廟，復渡河，經三盛公，天興泉至烏拉河，與綏遠接界，計長六百四十里，寗平路自寗蘭路的石空起，渡河經中寗，同心城，興隆堡至甘肅固原縣境，計長二百三十里，支綫原有八條，　金靈路，由金積縣城東門起，經吳忠堡，大寨子至靈武縣城，計長四十五里，　寗靈路，由寗朔縣城渡河，經河中堡至靈武縣城，計長四十里，　寗鹽路，由省城南經張政橋，渡河經橫城至鹽池縣城，計長三百五十里，　金豫路，由金積縣城南行，經滾泉，韋州達豫旺城，計長二百二十里，　寗中路，由寗蘭幹路的石空啣接起至中衛縣城，計長九十里，　寗定路，由省城西經新城至定遠營，計長一百五十里，　鹽豫路，由金豫支路的韋州起，經惠安堡至鹽池縣城，計長二百里，　金寗路，由金豫支路的滾泉起至中寗縣城，計長一百里，近又添五支綫，　靈豫路，由金靈支路的回漢堡起，經胡回堡至豫旺城，計長二百里，　淸洪路，由夏縣屬淸水堡起，經李岡堡至洪廣營，計長四十里，　寗臨路，由寗包路的石嘴山起，渡黃河兩决至二十里柳子達臨河境，計長四百餘里，　中紅路，由中衛縣城起經莫家樓，渡河至紅斷頭以達甘肅境，訐長二百餘里，　豫固路，由豫旺縣城起，經李旺莊以達甘肅固原縣境，計長一百餘里。</p>
<p>自民國二十二年寗夏省道管理處負責興修，所有幹錢三路及金靈，寗靈，寗定等支錢，陸續粗竣通車，現有汽車，計福特車六輛，道濟車十六輛，司徒偉車七輛，雪佛蘭車一輛，均係公營車，歸省道管理處管理營業，載量每輛一千百百斤至二千斤，平均每小時駛行五十里，客票每華里三分，外帶行李三十斤，貨票每百斤每日一分六釐，北路車按每月二·五·八等日開行。南路車按每月一·四·七等日開行，此外，運輸工具，尙有駱駝，騾馬，大車，轎車等等，運費大率較汽車爲廉，惟是行程遲緩，時間上大不經濟了。</p>
<p>水路交通，黃河自靖遠紅山峽流入寗夏省境，中衛以上，夾行兩山間，水勢湍急，船行每小時約二十華里，中衛以下，水流平緩，每小時的行十里，而且因爲河度游沙淤積，很容易遇着擱淺的發生。自中衛起經中寗，吳忠堡，寗朔，橫城，靑石堡，石嘴山，磴口，這幾處要埠，就是客貨裝卸的地方了。運輸工具，除木船外，有木筏，皮筏等，每隻載重的二萬斤，其餘還有小皮筏，僅供短途運輸的載用，倘乘木船，遇水流　進，那就要沿了岸邊繫欖繩在用勁的扯着船行，百里的路程，動不動拉三四日纔到，耗費多而甚不合算，所以人們多數還是由陸路輸運的了。</p>
<p>十一　天下黃河富寗夏</p>
<p>寗夏地處河套平原，沃壤千里，土質較前套猶覺佳美，穡稼畜牧，二者兼適。寗夏的地勢，西南高而東北低，黃河自賀蘭山的靑銅峽出口，逕向東北流，水勢緩和，曲折匯經中衛，環繞爲河套，以故鑿溝引水，耕耨灌溉，水利通暢，得天然的優勝，渠務發達，農田牧畜，甲於西北，自非無因。「黃河百害，獨利寗夏」，洵非虛構，茲將該省十大渠道，概列如下。</p>
<p>唐徠渠（又名唐渠）自寗朔縣大壩堡靑銅峽內起開渠口，經府城西，而北流至平羅縣上寳閘堡，歸入西河，長三百二十餘里，灌田十七萬九千餘畝。</p>
<p>漢延渠　自寗朔縣陳俊堡二道河起開渠口，經府城東，而北至寗夏縣王澄堡，歸入西河，長一百九十五里，灌田十二萬八千餘畝。</p>
<p>淸渠　自寗朔縣大壩堡馬關嗟起開渠口，至宋澄堡，歸入唐渠，長七十二里，灌田一萬六千二百多畝。</p>
<p>惠農渠（昔名皇渠）自漢壩堡剛家嘴起開渠口，流至平羅縣尾閘堡入黃河，長二百六十二里，灌田十一萬畝餘</p>
<p>昌潤渠　自寗夏縣通吉堡溜山子起開渠口，流至永屛堡，歸入黃河，長一百三十六里，灌田千六百九十餘畝。</p>
<p>河東秦渠（又名秦家渠）自靈武屬靑銅峽起開渠口，（今屬金積），流至北門外，洩入滂河長一百五十里，灌田七萬多畝。</p>
<p>河東漢渠（又名漢伯渠）在金積縣，渠口起自靑銅峽，與秦渠口相並，流至靈武胡家堡，洩入撈河，長一百里，灌田十二萬五千八百畝。</p>
<p>河東天水渠　在寗夏縣河忠堡，由靈武秦渠淸水溝接引金積縣漢渠的退水，流經史家塲入黃河，長三十餘里，灌田六千餘畝。</p>
<p>美利渠　自中衛縣西沙坡下石龍口尾起開渠口，流至石空寺堡，長二百里，灌田四萬五千餘畝。</p>
<p>七星渠　自中寗縣河南寗安堡泉眼山起開渠口，流至張恩堡，長一百四十里，灌田二萬七千八百餘畝。</p>
<p>査寗夏全省上述十大渠外，支渠紛紜，情形各異。如滂渠在平羅縣北溫家橋，舊貼渠，由大壩唐渠自南迤北至漢壩堡，新貼渠，由舊貼渠分水自南迤北至淸渠，其長均數十里不等。又該省新開雲亭渠，軍民屯墾，頗著成效。</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊申報兒童志願徵文我將來做怎樣的人  南京市立督糧廳小學校錢源洪　　現在一般中國人，個個想做大官，發大財，乘汽車，住洋房，穿西裝，吃大菜，一切自私自利之事，無所不爲；至於對於國家的前途，人民的福利，郤完全放在腦後，簡直一點也不問，因而這個强大的中國，就給這般貪官汚吏弄得「不可收拾」了。　　中國既是被這般貪官汚吏弄得「不可收拾」，那麼要挽救這種危局，使牠恢復像從前那樣光榮的人是誰呢？挽救的工具又是甚麼呢？　　這救濟牠的人不用說當然是將來的我們，救濟牠的工具，一定是科學了。　　我爲要挽救中國的危局，恢復過去的光榮起見，已經立定志向，要做一個科學家，將來發明了機械，增加我國的生產，以期抵制洋貨的輸入，杜絕金錢的流出，這樣我國便不會發生經濟恐慌了。　　並且還要發明耕種工具，改良我國人工耕種的方法，使他們應用少數人力，而生產多量的食糧，這樣我國便不會發生糧食恐慌了。　　我更要研究預防災害的方法，例如防止蟲害，就要發明除害的藥品，消滅害蟲；旱災時，就要應用科學方法，實施科學的灌溉；這樣農作物也不會受到災害，中國就可富强起來了。　　所以我立定志向，將來要做一個科學家。（作者近影）「最後一課」的回味  婉文　　現在時局這樣的嚴重，人家仗着他的武力，向我國侵略，我們做學生的，不由自主的想到以前所讀的最後一課國文了。　　在這一課中，述一個法蘭西兒童，他平時常想逃學，不歡喜讀書，有一天，他要想逃學而終於沒有逃學，在他進課室中的時候，情形和以前不同了，敎師穿了禮服，同學們都寂靜無聲，而面上現着依依不捨之狀，敎師非常嚴肅，又很誠懇地敎着書。這孩子起初不明白，後來聽了敎師的演講，才知道這時上最後一課的法文了，而他以前所恨而現在可愛的敎師，不久便要離開他們。他那一顆逃學的心，立刻懊悔以前的過失，他想在這最後一課的法文中，全能明白法文。但在你要盡力的學習法文時，德國的兵已經來了，敎師給他們最後的敎訓，便是要保持祖國的文字，如果亡國，也有復興的一日。　　我國現在也處於同等被侵略的地位，所以我們學生在這危急的時期，更要努力的求學，多讀一天書，便多知一些祖國的文化，到死也不要忘卻了祖國！記一個波蘭苦兒  惟經　　在歐洲大戰吿終之後五年，那是西歷一九二三年的十月十七日，有一位波蘭兒童，呌做斯德朗諾期基的，開始從波蘭出發，旅行歐洲。他的父親，是一個酒商，在歐戰之中，死在前錢的。在一九二三年上，他的母親是改嫁了。那時候，他只十三歲，便成爲一個無家可歸的流浪兒。那時，恰巧有一隊流浪着的吉潑賽人，在波蘭的貧民窟中演劇，斯德朗諾斯基，便要求着在劇團中充雜役。接着，他便被帶着流浪遍了巴爾幹半島，和小亞細亞諸國。一九二七年末，跟着那劇團！流浪到了德國。他便在一家夜總會中服役，有了間暇，便上圖書館去讀書。　　在德國住了一年，認識了一位鐵路家。這位鐵路家，因着公務，往波羅的海各國考察，便帶着他到丹麥，挪威，瑞典去住了好幾個月。一九二九年，那位鐵路家死了，他便離開德國，而往巴黎在一家劇院中服役。有暇，還是上圖書館讀書。一九三〇年的秋間，他偶然上馬賽去旅行，在無意間，踏上了一條貨船，竟被帶到了意大利。在意大利，一時找不到工作，流爲乞丐。後來由一個農夫，帶他到一個農塲中作工。那個農塲，離市很遠，沒有圖書館，他覺得十分苦悶，所以作了三個月的工，他便逃往了奧國。在維也納一家商店中任雜役一年，待着機會，又混進了巴黎。　　他第二决到巴黎，是一九三二年的春間。那時，因爲他的法文，已是說得很流利，所以便由一家百貨商店裏，聘爲售貨員。一九三三年春間，他上哈彿港去旅行，忽然動了遊英之念，於是有意的去躱在一條往英的貨船的煤艙中，偸偷地踏上了英格蘭的杜佛港。因爲他沒有英國的國籍，所以不能找到安定的生活。到了秋間，他才在利物浦一個小型的圖書館中，謀得一個洒掃的位置。從那時起，他一壁作工，一壁開始寫遊記。因爲他所經歷的，都是下層階級的生活，所以倒是相當的有價値。整整地寫了一年，才全部完成。這本遊記，是用法文寫成的，所以寫成之後，便由法國的一家書局給他出版。出版之後銷路很好，他所得的版稅很多，所以在一九三五年的秋間，他是進了法國的某中學，開始着他的學校生活了。　　斯德朗諾斯基，今年是二十六歲，能說歐洲的七種語言，通德法英波四國文字。雖然他不過是一個苦兒，並不是英雄，也不是名人，但我覺得他的奮鬥精神，是頗値得小朋友們，引以自勵的。天眞  閻重樓　　天眞，就是天然的眞實。　　兒童和成人不同的，是因爲他們有天眞；兒童被人羨慕的，也是他們的天眞歌德說：「伸手拿物是我們人類極自然的本能，有極心愛的物在眼前往來我總不敢伸手去捉拿，這是甚麼道理喲！小孩們不是見物就拿嗎？—但是，我呢？」這話正是說出成人的苦悶人，在兒童時代都是極其自然的，等到年齡漸漸長大，受外界的薰染，受環境的同化，於是他的天眞漸漸消失了！虛僞來代替他的眞實了！　　這社會是一個虛僞的社會，走進社會的人便不能不虛僞，要想成人和兒童有一樣的眞實，那就得把這個虛僞的社會改造。……但，這個希望似乎太奢了，不要說成人，我們覺得眼前兒童的環境也很不良，無論從那一方面說，兒童也有喪失了天眞的危險！　　如果連兒童都不能保持天眞，再到那裏去找眞實呢？（這世界不是更不成個樣子了嗎！）　　所以－成人應該時時維護兒童的天眞，兒童應該永遠保守自己的天眞。小小十年  公適　　——從1926－1935　　上期本刋有位「仁」兄，舉行了一决算術游戲，是把。至8九個數目字，分做三行，而得到的加數要成1935，這是一件很有味兒的玩意，許多聰明的小朋友必定都能想出來的。「仁」君自己的答案　　但是我們現在要隨便把它的位置調動一下，而得到的加數要變做1926從1926至1935恰好十年，十年前有許多小朋友還在媽媽懷抱中吃奶奶呢，那不是很値得回憶的一伴事嗎還有照上面說的再隨便變更一下，要橫看直看都是1935，那又怎樣安排呢？這都很容易，大家不妨再來玩一玩！冬天的太陽  陳鐵吾　　冬天的太陽，　　暖洋洋暖洋洋。　　好似母親溫暖的胸膛，　　救活了無量數小動物的　　生命。　　比觀世音還來得慈祥。　　冬天的太陽，　　熱蓬蓬熱蓬蓬。　　忘記了世界上有壓迫窮　　人的嚴冬，　　走起了人間幾許罪惡，　　比革命者還見有功。科學小問題爲什麽新棉衣比舊棉衣暖？  子系　　大家知道天氣冷了，身上就少不了穿上棉衣。同時拿穿棉衣的經騐證明新棉衣總比舊棉衣暖，這是什麼道理？小朋友，讓我細說給你們聽吧：　　因爲新棉衣的質地鬆，張着向空中去看，可以透進很多亮光，舊棉衣質地緊，張着向空中去看，有時簡直透不進亮光。照理舊棉衣穿在身上應該比較暖，因爲他少空隙，不易散熱，豈知事實完全相反，這原因因爲空氣是不容易把熱傳導的，常身上的熱把衣內的空氣傳熱了後，就不易再將熱傳給衣外的空氣。新棉衣旣然質地鬆，空氣自然很多，能容納多量的空氣，因爲被傳熟的空氣愈多，所以就覺得愈暖熱。反之，舊棉衣的鬆度小，空隙少，因爲少含空氣，自然它的熟度不及新棉衣了。所以我們若把棉衣穿舊了，最好拿到棉衣店裏去彈彈鬆再穿，也是很經濟而實惠的辦法。兒童園地看報的益處  南洋第一附小六年級生陳錦銘　　我們大家知道，看報的益處，在於能明瞭社會的眞相和國家的大事，以及世界各國之形勢。其實，報好像是一部長期流動的文庫，又像一部百科讀本，它的內容，除了時事之外，其他有論文。科學。傳記。敎育。遊記。體育。文藝。經濟等等的文字，看了論文可以明瞭對於國家的觀念；看了科學，可知各種事業的發明；看了傳記，可知古今名人的偉跡；看了敎育，可以明白文化的情形；看了遊記，可以認識各地風土人情；看了體育，自己亦能使身體强健；看了文藝，可使我們的作文進步；看了經濟，可明嘵中國的金融問題。所以看了報，能開發我們的愚蒙，增加我們的知識，允其是在幼年時代，記憶力比較强些，如能多閱報紙，其得益是未可限量的。　　註：橫的要從右面看，吾則便不對了。本刊徵求兒童科學　　一，須與兒童日常生活有關，並能引起兒童研究興趣之科學常識；　　二，每篇長的六七百字，須加挿圖額三幅，使兒童可以按圖實騐；　　三，錄取後酬報從豐；　　四，三月二十日截止收稿。故事畫  張友鑑　　—一個渡河的方法－　　　哥哥和弟弟到河岸邊去玩，哥哥忽然說：一我可以到對岸去。」因爲他看見河中浮着一個柬西向對岸游去。　　　哥哥毫不思索地便跳向那個浮着的東西上：不料那東西被哥哥一踏，頓時向水面上冐了起來，却原來就象大胖子；這樣，哥哥險些兒跌倒水裏去了。　　　象大胖子知悉哥哥的用意，便用足力：一鼓氣，把哥哥吹到對岸去。　　　哥哥果然到了對岸，便感謝象大胖子，道時弟弟也脫下帽子，歡呼着說；「多麼好的一個渡河的方法呀！」五分鐘的童話  何公超　　　小小的一塊　　狼對牛說：「我要吃你一塊肉，只耍小小的一塊就够了。你的身體這麼大，吃掉小小的一塊肉，眞是不在乎啊。」　　牛點點頭，說道：「好，你吃罷。」　　以後，狼繼續不斷地作同樣的要求，每决只要小小的一塊肉。牛總以爲自己的身體很大，吃掉小小的一塊肉不在乎，每决總是答應他。　　於是，狼一點一點的從無關緊要的四脚吃起，一直吃到生命有關的頭腦和臟腑；等到吃到了頭腦和臟腑，牛便倒地死了。這時候狼是多麼得意啊！他伏在牛的屍體上，大吞大嚼，不久就把整個的牛體吞在肚裏了。　　　「你去求上帝罷！」　　一隻輪船上，有三十個人。輪船觸了礁，快要沉沒了。船長拿了救命圈，預備分給大家，但在未分之前，先問道：「誰會向上帝禱告？」　　三十個人中有一個是牧師，他挺身而出，喊道：「我會禱吿！」　　船長說道：「那很好，你去禱吿罷！我們的救命圈只有廿九隻，恰巧少一隻。你去禱告罷！」　　　子彈的遊戲和洗操　　在戰塲上，兩顆子彈在談話：　　甲：我穿過了一個人的腦子，那時候，他正在想着他的嬌妻和愛子，我一穿過，他的想像立刻停止了，好像銀幕上的影戲，突然停止一樣，這在我，眞是有趣的遊戲。　　乙：你這還不稀罕。我穿過了一個人的心臟，我在他的血袋子裏洗了一個紅色的操。噯呀！這個操眞洗得爽快！　　甲：誰說「人是萬物之靈！」他們的身體不過是我們遊戲和洗澡的塲所罷了！　　乙：可是，你別忘記：我們子彈也是人造出來的啊！人到底是「萬物之靈！」義狗傳（八）  心靑　　可是那一片廣大而碧綠的原野，在一個小孩子和一頭狗瞧去，已是無上美善的了。等到他們的工作一完畢，就可躺在運河岸旁的草堆裏，眼瞧着笨重的船隻駛過，帶着大海中的鹽味吹送過來，和夏季鄕野中的花香混合在一起。　　這是實在好，到了冬季，他們的生活是難受些了。他們須在黑暗中起身，天氣冷得可怕，他們也難得像平時那麼吃較多的東西，而他們的小屋也敵不過夜間的尖風，但是在和暖的時期，這屋子瞧去是美麗的，他幾乎全埋在綠油油的藤蔓下，雖然不生什麼果實，而實在是很可悅目的。　　在冬季那可憐的小屋子的牆上，開了好多的窟窿，被一陣陣的風吹將進來，牆上的藤蔓，葉兒都落了，變做了黑色。外面的田野，一片荒凉，而屋中的地板上，常常也冰凍着。冬季的寒冷，委實是難受得很，小南洛的小手和小脚全部凍僵了，一條條的冰柱，割破了柏德希的脚。　　但是在這樣的環境之下也從沒有聽得過他們倆的抱怨。那孩子的木鞋，和那狗的四條腿很勇敢地在冰凍的地上踏去。脚步聲和皮帶上的響鈴聲互相應和；在盎凡爾的街上，有時有慈善的婦人們給他們喝一碗湯或吃一些麵包，在他們回家去的路上，也許有幾位的慈善的商人　丟幾根木柴，在他們的小車中，而他們本村裹的主婦們收受了那送去的牛乳後，也許分一些給他們喝，於是他們很高興的跑過了那磑磑一白的雪地帶着一天暮色，歡呼着跑進他們的屋子。　　一切的一切，在他們都覺得是再好沒有的了。柏德希在街上遇到好多的狗，往往從天明做到黃昏，所得到的酬報，只有鞭打和咒駡，到得工作完畢時，便被生人一脚踢開去，由它們挨凍挨餓，甚麼都不管，柏德希和它們比較之下，就很感激自已的命運，是世界中最最僥倖的了。它在夜間躺下來時，雖也覺得很飢餓；它在炎熱的夏午和冰冷的冬朝，雖也必須出去工作；它的脚雖也常常被那崎嶇不平的街路所刺傷；它的工作有時雖也和它的個性不合，或它的氣力所担受不了的，—然而它仍是很感激很滿足：它每天盡它的責任，而兩雙仁愛的眼睛，總是帶着笑對它瞧。柏德希覺得甚麼都已滿足了。　　只有一件事情，往往使柏德希感覺不安的，是這麼一回事，原來盎凡爾的地方，大家都知道它在每一個轉角七都峙立着一塊塊的大石，從古代遺傳下來，黑黑的像怪物一般，它們的上面有鐘聲鏜鏜地　着，而從它們那些弓形的門中常有音樂聲送將出來。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊業餘漫譚兒童讀物問題  束潔　　一個人所藉以維繫生命的，除了物質的米麥以外，更有一種精神的糧食。有一種人在物質方面儘管豐衣足食享用不盡，但若精神上缺少了可供療飢的東西，這個人的生活將永遠空虛，永遠痛苦，以至不能維擊他肉體的生命而趨向自殺，這種現象，　織份子的身王更表現　　顯的痕跡　孩子，餘了糖果玩具之外，他得需要另一種非物質的東西，那就是「無限量的知識」。於是我們常說：兒童讀物是兒童精神的糧食。　　但做父母的，做敎師的，負保障兒童幸福之責的，他們幾曾爲了這個而注意過他們的糧食品質的優劣？　　粗劣的糧食，不衛生的糧食　無　　的給孩子們吃了，因此不知傷了多少孩子的脆弱的脾胃。　　看着孩子們整天沉浸在連環圖畫神怪小說里面，我的心，受到了莫名的痛苦。　　在提倡兒童幸福的所謂兒童年中，我們除了看見轟轟烈烈的開幕典禮之外，似乎「兒童幸福」又遁入空漠的太空中去了。孩子在某些角落里還沒有爭取到做人的　利，就是在中上層的人　　生活着的孩子，揭開了他們生活的內層，還不是依然是父母的附屬，家長的附屬，師長的附屬，以至於社會的附屬？就是從兒童讀物上講，在這空前的兒童年中，有過什麼和非兒童年時不同的好成績？孩子們依然沉浸在連環圖畫里，孩子們的腦海里依然充滿了神怪小說的毒素，孩子們永遠吞服着麤劣的糧食—精神的糧食！　　兒童年快要到尾聲，全國兒童讀物展覽會居然在新春里應市了，這不能不說是差强人意的事！會中蒐集全國歷來的兒童讀物於一堂，兼及於歷來各書坊出版的小學敎科書，而允注意於不良讀物的陳列，使參觀的人可對我國現下兒童讀物的狀况得到一個概括的印象，從茲努力將來，爲未來的兒童們留一點生機，其意義的確很高。　　但我個人尙有不能已於言者數事：　　第一，記得有一時大家都感到「貓姐」「牛哥」等等物語的無聊，主張另用一種方式去撰述故事，又記得有人鑒於今日是科學的世界，應使兒童多得到一些科學知識，所以後來，如「科學小把戲」之類的讀物便如雨後春筍般的興起了。但所謂另一方式的撰述技術如何，則始終未見得到公正的評價。灌輸科學知識的原則誠然是不錯的，但如已見出版的科學小把戲之類，似乎尙未能使兒童如對於神怪小說一樣的熱中研讀，這讀書的「興趣問題」，讀物的「糖衣問題」，似乎太少人注意及此。　　第二，兒童讀物之需要普遍傳布，猶如飲食之需要普遍獲得，同爲天經地義，可是一看現實的情形，却又不能不使我們覺得前途非常悲觀。一方面學生家長普徧的貧窮化，學生的課外閱讀於是成爲「奢侈」品，一方面兒童讀物的價格依然是過於高昂，使中等家庭的兒童也减少不少閱讀的機會。關於兒童讀物利潤之過厚，據書業中人說：曾有幾家書局確因此起家。本來以中國人口之衆多，書局之營兒童讀物的又僅此數家，若一旦普敎著有成效，其營業之興旺自可預卜，若能减低利潤，便普遍地給兒童們享用，其所得還是一樣的。　　第三，營兒童讀物業的過於商業化，凡利之所在，羣趨向之，羣模仿之，而能獨闢蹊徑，使兒童獲得另一方向的優益者則絕鮮。事實是很顯明的；在某一時期，書賈們見大中學生應用書籍的銷路漸狹隘了，不知如何轉念及於黃口小兒頭上來了，於是這一家小朋友叢書，那一家小學生叢書，又一家新兒童叢書，比較內容還是千篇一律，甚至「後來居下」者亦不少。爲了兒童着想，希望書賈們從此把腦袋淸醒一下，不必再抄人家的文章，就是爲書賈們自己血本着想，也大有懸崖勒馬的必要！各業調查九江的磁業  家瑀　　九江位於長江中部，爲江西全省客貨進出的咽喉孔道；市面的繁華鼎盛頗不遜於江西省會的南昌。在民國十五年前，全縣人口的有十二萬左右，其中以來自各縣及鄰省的苦力居多。出口貨有棉花，蔴，夏布，米，芝蔴，豆，磁器等，出超之鉅，每年不下數千萬元。厥後革命軍興，江西處於軍事首要地位，上述各貨的產量遂比往年略有退縮。及至現在，除磁器一項尙有少數　　外，其餘如米，棉花，甚至還要仰仗別省供給，由出超一變而爲入超了。　　至於磁器，因爲是贛省獨特的生產，所以尙可維持出口的地位，但較之民十五年的出口情形，自是相　甚遠，即就廿三年與廿叫年兩年來比較，也是逐年祇有下降，我們祇要一看下表，便可知道贛省的瓷業已經衰落到什麼程度了！　　江西景德鎮可說是世界聞名的一個磁器出產區，但牠因交通不發達，所以在輸出方面，除了偶然有一兩次是用「艨艟戰艦」一般的大民船」直接運到上海來而外，差不多全靠九江做牠吐納的啊喉；因此一般往來於長江上游的商客，都祗知道九江的磁器價廉物美，而不知產磁區却是遠距九江有百多里路程的景德鎭。九江旣佔了地利上的優勢，所以經營磁器的商店的數目倒也不在景德鎭「窰戶」的數目之下。在民國十五年間，九江的磁器商店共有四十餘家，都是經營出口貿易的；趕船的「磁販」也有二百餘人。據說當時磁器銷行於國內外的數目，較去年的銷數的多至五倍以上，一般磁商及「磁販」每年都有數百元以至數萬元的盈餘。可是，「好景不常」，自一九二八年捲來了不景氣的浪潮以後，各項商業都漸漸的衰落下來，這江西特產的磁業自然也不能巍然獨存，於是昔”獲利甚豐的磁器商店及「磁販」便紛紛倒閉，停歇，到了最近，共尙能維持現狀的，恐怕只有昔日的一半的數目了。　　九江的磁器商店差不多都是九江本地的資本，南昌人經營的僅有江西瓷業公司等兩家；「磁販」則大多數都是「都昌」人，九江人僅佔其中百分之十，所以在船上競爭的力量究不及「都昌帮」那麼的大。資本雄厚的磁器店，多半是派有「莊客」常川駐在景德鎭，隨時購買所需　貨物，而需要的一種貨物　多數是整　的預　　這樣，不獨　　便宜，並且一種貨物的樣式也可以隨意「包定」（即一種貨物不能同時售於別人）。在付貨欵方面，因資本大，進貨必多，一般「窰戶」爲了營業上的競爭，都自願對客家放欵；一千元的貨物，能付出四百元的，在「窰戶」眼中已經認爲是很好的顧客了。但小資本的磁器店就沒有這許多的便宜，而且因爲資本薄弱，根本就不敢向景德鎭定貨而不得不就近向本地的大磁器店轉批，在這一轉手之間，貨價就比「鎭上」景德鎭的簡稱　要高出百分之一二十了。大磁店的營業方針，多偏重於出口貿易和枇發，小磁店則銳意經營門市，允其對外來的客商特別的重視，所以各商店都　有臨時掮客，遇有長江輪船及外國兵船或南潯火車到達九江時，便派他們上去兜攬生意。　　「磁販」營業的對象大都以過往的輪船爲主體；每天營業的好壞可說是絲毫沒有把握。一遇輪船到了九江，這一二百「磁販」便都掮着盛磁器用的籃子搶着上船，佔好地位，把一塊幾尺見方的粗布朝舺板上一鋪，這場合便成了他預定的營業商場，其他的同行見了就不能再搶奪了。接着便把籃里的貨物一樣一樣的陳列起來，然後蹲在邊下等候顧主。在這里購買磁器，如果不懂得他們的門檻，有時也許會花了五六倍的價錢，還買不到像岸上　即磁器店—那樣的眞實貨色，因爲「磁販」手裹的磁器並沒有一定的價目，他們是看客人的態度隨口說價，　　要　　錢的東西，有時也許只出兩角或三角錢　　　　到。這種　　　販的　　方針充　是以欺騙爲手腕，欺騙得成功，便可多賺一點利潤；所以他們一天的收入，頗難有一定的把握，有時十元二元，有時十元二十元，在他們心目中都不算是什麽稀奇的現象的。生活醫寓學徒  毛鳳圖　　我滿十二歲的時候，父親便送我到城里去學醫。在百行職業中，除了讀書做官之外，就要算是學醫了吧。我們那些地方很尊重醫生，允其是「儒醫」。所謂「儒醫」就是內科醫生，這當然是就中醫說的。在我們那偏僻的縣城，在十年前是不知道有什麼西醫的，卽或有，也不相信他會治病。「儒醫」出門治病，手裏除拿一根長的葉子菸（旱烟）袋而外，並不像「草藥醫生」（外科醫生）要肩着偌大一個搭達（藥包），因爲他只給人診脈開藥方，是不賣藥配藥的。而且一出門，如果是附近名望很大的醫生，總是病家用轎子接送。而我的先生（師父）便是那地方的一個很有名的醫生。　　學醫總是書香之家的子弟的職業。因爲起碼也耍把「四書」讀過，起碼也要能提筆作文的子弟，才能認識「傷寒論」，「神農本草」上的深奧的字眼，也才能開脈案，說病理。學徒到了「滿師」之後，他所享受的待遇和所得的酬報，都比旁的職業優厚。所以我把「四書」和「詩經」，「左傳」讀完，又能做「學而時習之論」的文章後，便開始「投師」了。　　我的父親領着我，手里提了一提籃的禮物和紙燭火砲，送我到師父的寓所來。事前是經過了多番商議的。因爲師父有名望，到他那里去投師的很多，他用不着這樣多學徒，沒有時間和精神來敎育照顧。經父親再三央求，又託旁人轉懇，才准暫時試試。我一進師父的門，便看見一個肥胖胖的年的五十的老頭兒，滿臉除了長着橫亂的鬍鬚外，便是一對骇人的眼和粗黑的肉。心里頓時毛骨悚然。燃着蠟燭紙砲給先生「磕頭」之後，父親說，「請先生耐耐煩煩地敎…管嚴些…」，以外便是「我待徒弟不比得人家，第一是嚴…「黃荆棍上出好人」…「玉不琢不成器」…」師父這如雷吼一般的話。　　先生家里除了有一個師母而外，就是除我以外的四個學徒，也就是我的師兄。他們也有二十幾歲的，也有十七八歲的，都比我大。當學徒的規定，是「大的出門，小的吃虧。」後來的師弟總是要「打毛坯」的，一切粗雜的事都該才來的「生手」去做。當我父親離我去後，我便如失掉家庭的人兒一樣。師兄照例是來分派工作。早晨起來先要打掃樓上樓下的地板，揩凈桌椅板櫈。過後上街買菜，上井打水。接着就是煮飯，洗碗。一直做到夜深上門。有了師弟，師兄們除了分批跟着先生出去「看病」而外，便只是坐在書桌上讀醫書，他是一點也不幫助師弟做事的。因爲每一個師兄他們都是經過了這一個階段的，而且師父和師母也决不讓他們來代勞，這也許就是在琢玉吧。家里的雜務自不用說了，倘若有病人到家裏來診病，師兄們聽先生的命令，還可以出去按脈，或執筆開方，由先生改正，但我只有在奉茶遞烟時才敢到客堂去一趟，其餘的時間仍是藏在廚房里做事。　　我上學已到一月了，師父還未正式敎我一點醫書。雖然我也從家裹就帶了幾部「湯頭歌訣」「脈訣歸正」之類初學入門的書來，但是放在那裏從沒時間去讀，師父也沒呌我去讀過。我暗自想到：我是來學職業的，求學問的，並不是來替先生家做工的。若果長此下去，五年「滿師」怎樣了呵！在黑夜裏，在一個人洗衣的時候，在一鋼人冒着風雨去買菜的途中，想起家裏的父親，母親，以及活潑可愛的弟妹，他們是多麼快樂呵！　　我唯一的希望是要我的父親來接我回去，不然便是希望先生有另外的「生手」學徒。但是一月兩月一年都過去了，我仍是不斷地工作着。一本「脈訣歸正」還未讀熟。　　在第二年，大師兄和二師兄相繼「出師」了。「出師」的時候就要「謝師」，「謝師」是錢和禮物。「謝師」的錢是在「投師文的」上定下了的，至少要一百串（當時的合百元），分五年繳淸。在「出師」時又要給師父和師母送禮帽，禮衣，禮鞋。在當學徒的期問除給「先生錢」外，其餘如伙食房錢以及零用雜費都要按月繳給先生收存，他於這上面也可取些油水。在學徒學到第四年上將近出師時，便可以奉先生之命單獨到病家去看病，但所得「脈理錢」仍须全數歸入先生。先生有忙不過來的時候，就是才學三年的學徒也可代他去應診賺錢。一個稍爲有名的醫生多半是有四五個學徒的，大的兩個可以分頭去為他掙錢，中間的兩個便分頭跟他去出門，其餘末尾的一個便專門爲他做事。頂多隔一年就要招收一二個生手。這樣他才繼續有人用，有人去賺錢，才能得剩餘價値。我在第二年便有師弟來接替我所作的雜務了，但先生仍然沒有正式敎過我讀書，我只是在師兄處領敎，或者有十分不懂的地方才去問，但是先生　根本講不出什麼，只是說「多臨些症就對了」。按脈也只是模模糊糊地猜想，這也許是「浮」脈吧，呵，怕是「沉」脈。把脈按了又不知開藥方，先生總是啣着烟袋給你說，「桂枝甘草湯…加白朮，黨參…二錢…三錢…」。他也不講解爲什麼要用這樣的藥。你只有多默記一些「湯頭」，多默記一些「病症」，隨時自己去試騐，去碰運氣，至於這是什麼什麼病，你决沒有一定的認識方法，也沒有一定的用藥方法。病人的生死也是看他的運氣如何。這樣，你又不斷地讀了一些「傷寒淺註」呵，「病理訣微」呵，張仲景的什麼「十六種」呵，你又跟着先生按過多回脈，開過多回方，自己也就彷彿懂得醫理了一樣，這你就離「出師」不遠了。話得說回來，雖然師父沒敎你什麼，但是你「出師」後，到了過年過節或師父師母壽誕，你仍有送禮的義務。　　五年的學徒生活好容易磨滿，我的年齡也距二十不遠，滿以爲從此可以謀生賺錢了。但是年靑的醫生人家說你沒有經騐，而且同行似乎非常之多，病人却反而非常之少了。也許是謀這種職業的人太多而醫不起病的人也太多了的綠故吧。這迫得我賦閒了幾年，又不能不改行。但是這五年的學徒生活我倒是永不會忘記的。幽默小品多言的小販  龍若水　　年老的摩斯，他是一個以販賣雞蛋和谿雛爲業的黑人，爲人誠實可靠，可是他有一種不良的習慣，就是愛和顧主們喋喋不休的作閒談，因此他常把他們所要購買的雞蛋的數目弄錯。每天，他驅着滿裝貨物的一輛小驢車，上街去做買賣。有一次，他把車停在一個老太太家的門前，因爲那位太太從屋子里出來，要向他購買一些東西。　　「老伯伯，你今天有雞蛋沒有？」她問。　　「有，有，有，剛剛從鄉下販來了十打雞蛋。」　　「東西還新鮮嗎？」　　「保你滿意。這些都是很新鮮的。」　　「那末，給我拿九打罷。你就把雞蛋數在這隻籃子裏。」　　「很好，太太。」他數着雞蛋：「一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，九，十。——你可以相信得過，這些都是很新鮮的。少爺在學堂裏唸書，讀到第幾冊了？現在一定是長得很長很大的了。」　　「是的，老伯伯，他在加爾維斯敦的一家銀行裏常行員。」　　「哦，今年有多大年紀了？」　　「有十八歲了。」　　「哦，眞是能幹得很！一個十八歲的人已經會賺錢了！十八，（數雞蛋），十九，二十，，二十一，二十二，二十三，二十四，二十五。——小姐近來也很好罷？我上决碰到她的時候，她差不多已經長得和大人一樣了。」　　「她已經出嫁，而且住到達拉斯去了。」　　「乖乖龍帝束，日子眞不知是怎樣過去的！你說，她已經有了孩子了嗎？不知道她今年有多大年紀了？我想她大的該有……」　　「已經有三十三歲了。」　　「眞的嗎？三十三，（數雞蛋），三十四，三十五，三十六，三十七，三十八，三十九，四十，四十一，四十二，四十三。——說也奇怪，你家少爺小姐也有這樣老了。說是你老人家還有孫兒，那我更其不能相信。看來你老人家也還不過是四十三歲的光景呢。」　　「瞎說！我知道你是故意敷衍我。當一鋼人到了五十三歲的時候……」　　「五十三？我可不相信。五十三，（數雞蛋），五十四，五十五，五十六　　　請你當心　　，我們不要把雞蛋數錯了。——五十七，（數雞蛋），五十八，五十九，六十，六十一，六十二，六十三，六十四。——嘎吁吁，，今天天氣熱得來！現在我繼覺得自己眞的已經老了！我是活不了幾久的了！但是你老人家府上的人却個個都是多福多壽的，據說你的老太爺去世的時候，高壽有七十歲呢！…』　　「不，是七十二。」　　「的確，那是很老了。——七十二，（數雞蛋），七十三，七十四，七十五，七十六，七十七，七十八，七十九。——還有你的老太太呢？她是我所遇到的一切最高貴的太太中間的一個，你老人家也時常和我談到她的。至於她，那是活得更久了，差不多快要活到一百歲。我相信她去世的時候是已經超過了一百歲的。」　　「不，老伯伯，她去世的時候只有九十六歲呢。」　　「那也不算小了。——九十，六，，（數雞蛋），九十七，九十八，九十九，一百，一百零一，一百零二，一百零三，一百零四，一百零五，一百零六，一百零七，一百零八。——這里一共是一百零八隻雞蛋，剛合九打的數目，　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>都是很好的，很新鮮的。這裹我再加舊一隻，因爲說不定我把數目弄錯了。」　　年老的摩斯做成了一注好生意，便很高興地走了。過了幾天，那位女太太對　的丈夫這樣說：　　「老媽子瑪地爾遠，我怕是非把她歇掉不可了。她倒會偸東西！一共有多少隻雞蛋，我是很淸楚的。這些雞蛋，我前天纔　來，可是，到現在不過兩天工夫，就已經少了。半了。我記得我還站在門口，親眼看好老摩斯一個一個的數着，九打雞蛋是一點也不會錯的。」小小專著文化之發生  放　　關於文化發生時的形態，有二種相反的學說：第一種呌播行論（Theory　ofdiffusion），另一種呌獨行論（Theoryof　independent　development）。播行論的意思是，一民族其本身沒有文化，牠的發生文化都從別民族傳播得來。獨行論與之相反，民族本身會發生文化，各民族有類似的文化，不是相互影響採納，而是在類似環境下獨立發展所致。這兩種學說應該是站在相對的地位，互爭長短，但據我們看來，却是彼此互爲補充，不相衝突的。　　按播行論又名轉借論（Theory　ofborrowing，其意見於轉借二字，更形明瞭。主張此種學說者，爲英國史密斯（Smith）等。一民族發生文化後，如文字，語言，風俗，信仰，以及物質文明，可被某一民族借去；結果，各民族相互轉借，有許多文化，其特質極相似，這是因爲都從一個源流傳播轉借而來的。譬如文字，因希臘正敎傳至俄國，俄文與希臘文便有很多同形同音之字。中文與日文，更可見一斑。語言亦然，中世紀阿拉伯人的勢力，擴充到西班牙，歐洲語言中便大量採用阿拉伯語，如Admiral　Arsenal，Zero等語都是阿拉伯語。中國沒有接吻的風俗，海禁開後，電影上時常出現。埃及的浴堂，被羅馬人採用作王宮中富麗的浴池。印度的佛敎，傳至暹邏等地，同樣受人尊敬。德國的華爾茲舞，美國人非常歡迎。這種例子實在很多，由此可知一民族的文化，大多數是借自他一民族的。世界上所以有相同之文化，乃是播行的結果。　　我們很贊同播行論，文化中確有此現象。不過，我們進一步探究之後，知道播行論有個缺點，難能掩飾。我們只要問這一問題：埃及是被播行論者假定爲文化的最先播行者的，但是埃及的文化又怎麼會发生的？埃及之前沒有更早的播行者，牠的文化一定是日神奧息利（Osiris埃及最大的神）所賜的了；或者說，埃及是天生的文化播行者。這解釋顯然很貧乏，這樣，文化如何發生，這問題仍未解决。事實很明白：播行論只能解釋有了文化之後的現象，對於文化本身發生上的解釋很是不充分；因最早最早的古文化民族的文化不能說是轉借而來。文化本身的發生條件，或者說，埃及文化何能發生，這一課題，只有獨行論可來擔任。　　獨行論就是文化有獨立發展的意思，又可呌做獨立起源論（Theoryof　independent　origin）：因爲文化不受旁的同化影響，不與旁的接觸，也可呌做平行論（Parallelism）。這是當然的事：世界上最早的文化民族的文化是自己發生的。問題只在於爲什麼各民族間有相互類似的文化？照播行論的意見是相互接觸；獨行論是，凡在相似環境下，便會產生相似的文化，不必要傳撥，獨立發展也可以。獨行論極重視環境。　　下面三種環境，可以使文化獨立發展，也可使文化的發生相似：　　一，人類普通心理上的傾向相同。　　二，人生的基本需要相同。　　三，賴以生活的客觀環境相同。　　這三個意見是亨金斯（Hankins）所提出，只是把决序和用語更改一下罷了。亨金斯的次序和用語是這樣的：一，天然的需要，二，物質與環境的體系，三，人類心理的同一。我們所以把人類心理列於第一，是因爲牠更近於文化，後二者則似乎傾向於文明。　　人類的心理，不僅感官或知覺相同，就是思想也相同。不過這裏的思想是廣大的，包括一切有條理的推理聯想。可舉的例子很多，但這裏只能提出幾樣。譬如宗敎的發生，由於天體現象引起人類心理的恐懼與畏敬，神常居於天上或竟代表天及天上諸物，如日月星辰等。跪拜這一種風俗是由於極大的虔誠，尊重，歡欣等心理衝動，虔誠的是宗敎，尊重的是見長老，歡欣的都表現於求婚和親　孩子。藝術是由於人類愛美心理，如文身這風氣是，原始人雖不知衣服之美，但光身子却仍舊要油彩黔刺；歌唱是音調美，舞蹈是活動美，彫刻是靜止美。這幾種裹面，固然有求生的成分滲雜着，但心理的成分也佔大多數：虔敬的時候，全世界人都知道跪下。　　第二第三可不必廢筆墨來贅述。全世界都知道衣可以禦寒，食時往口中送，到處都有房屋，都有舟車。客觀環境也很重耍。河流會產生文化，沙漠會產生宗敎，草原會產生畜牧的生產方式，熱帶氣候會產生早婚，冷帶氣候會產生憂鬱病，島地會產生冒險海上的習性。　　文化雖有傳染病，但一民族還有其獨立成份，這我們呌做文化的模式（Pattern）。文化的模式也爲獨行論者所注意。造成文化模式的因素，有下面三種　　一，地理的關係愛斯基摩人穿皮衣，非洲人不穿，這是寒暖關係。沙漠中人不吃魚，沿海人善食魚，這是河流關係。　　二，歷史的關係歐洲人都受羅馬帝國的薰陶，中國人受不到，兩種文化便生岐異。　　三，種族的關係白人移殖到美洲，產生高度文化，而處於同一地方的印第安人則依舊原始，這是種族不同的關係。　　獨行論能解釋文化之發生，播行論能解釋文化之變遷——文化變遷中，旁族文化的接觸是很有力的——要合此二者，文化如何生成這問題始可以解决。文藝作品弟弟的喜事（六）  益　　防匪的軍事佈置後，空氣比較和緩了一些。多嘴的女人又打開了話匣子：　　「張家莊前夜遭搶啦！據說還殺死一個守夜的長年哩！老太太的送終衣服都搶跑了！」　　「是啦！現在眞不成個世道：上前晚我們村里，李大戶家還不是失了盜，——其實說偸，也等於搶：來了八九個人，都拿的有兇器，不過沒有殺人。嗯，很奇怪！那些强盜的臉上都十都沫的有鍋烟，聽說有一個很像殺豬老王哩！」　　「還不是？本地方沒人引錢，別的人那有那麼熟悉？我們溝里有好幾個壞傢伙，都在幹這生意哩！」　　「……………………………………」　　就這麼你報吿一番，我報吿一番：那兒拉了肥豬，某處又抱了童子。一人說，兩人和，說得有聲有色，好像就是眼前發生的事實！　　這些消息雖不免有點誇張，但家鄉的情形，比起從前來確是大大不同了。單就我們村里來說，搶刦的事從來沒有，就是偸盜也很少見。空氣常是平和的，人們是安居樂業的。可是這决我回到家里，却再也不能吸收那種「平和」的空氣，再也見不着那種「安居樂業」的太平景象。僅僅有的十天中，我聽着了四五决匪警，遇着了兩决大兵催糧的騷擾！　　「世道人心」，眞變得不同了！　　冬季的白天特別溜去得快，一陣忙亂中天便昏黑了。這時家人的注意點又集中在弟弟的寫事上，翻過今夜這個坎兒，明天，便是正式的喜期，而婚禮上的佈置以及一切開消都還沒有着落。家人渴望着的二哥還不見回來，也沒有找人送個消息。他張羅得怎樣呢？一切一切該還順利罷。每個人都提心吊胆的盼望着，而且湧着同樣的意識：該有辦法吧！　　當家人們等待得十分焦急的時候，二哥居然回來了，後面跟了好幾挑籮　，裏面裝得滿滿的，大的是肉呀，酒呀，……總之，明天必需的東西也許都預備了。這時家里的人都比較輕快些，臉上現出一點活氣！　　二哥同客人們打了招呼，寒暄了一陣，纔默然的走進爸爸屋里。媽媽，二嫂，我，都跟了去，彷彿他吸取了我們的靈魂一樣！他揩了一把冬天的汗，然後嘆息似的說：　　「怎麼來這樣多的客啦！」　　「是啦！趁熱鬧。沾一點親的，都跑了來！」媽媽忿然的說。　　「…………………………」（未完）播音節目口琴　　悠社口琴組　　中西（一〇四〇）上午十一時起　　女神舞（二重奏）（過祖畊，過家容）跳舞室之響（張濛影）天國與地獄（潘弗心）月下情歌（二重奏）過祖畊，過家容）HA　CHACHA（張舟影）龍翔鳳舞（過祖畊）頑石行進曲（李志甫）　　愛麗仙（三重奏）（過祖畊，過家容）卜郞琪將軍（二重奏）（張濛影，張舟影）快樂的家庭（變體曲）（過　畊）情郞行進曲（林勻英）　　月光社口琴隊　　元昌（一一二〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　雙應進行曲（二重奏）（趙競，陳航）奧維他圓舞曲（趙競）東方舞（二重奏）（陳航，趙競）精兵（陳航）頑石行進曲（二重奏）（志剛，志南）美國巡邏兵（志南）悲歌（趙競，陳航）拉波洛馬（陳航）快樂銅匠（二重奏）（趙競，陳航）　　童星金惠漱新作「萬里尋親」　　大光明今日起映特別節目　　藝鳴社　　中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十一時　　永遠親愛（藝瑾）鋤頭舞歌（蓓　）逃亡曲沈里）夜深深（藝　）我路你的一切（劍　）　　新新（七八〇）下午三時至五時　　江亢虎博士講「中國文化」歌唱　　明梅團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　丁香山（前奏）綄紗歌（雨焚）飛花歌（純美）魚兒跳（純美）（張素貞）小東西（雨焚）微微風（純美）娥眉月（張　貞）夜戰場（純美）賣油條（張素貞）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一〇二〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　醉太平（前奉）愛向何處尋（　麗）甜蜜的夢（曼麗）光明之路（玲玲）空中音樂（合唱）漁民淚（曼　）桃花　（　傑）休息五分鐘（玲玲）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Outside Dagukou: Ice Freezing Solidly; 34 Ships Trapped; Losses Reach 1.5 Million in Two Weeks; Tianjin Shipping Industry Holds Emergency Meeting, Increases Rental of Two Icebreakers; Starving Crew and Passengers Risk Walking on Ice to Tanggu <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: Due to renewed snowfall on the 22nd and strong easterly winds, the ice at Dagukou is accumulating thicker and thicker, making the situation increasingly serious. The Tianjin shipping industry held an emergency meeting at 6 p.m. on the 22nd, and again requested Wang Gengsan and others to visit the Director of the Tianjin Customs and Haihe Engineering Bureau to ask for immediate assistance. They also increased the rental of the British and Japanese icebreakers "Malaya" and "Fengtian Maru" to assist the two icebreaking vessels of the Haihe Engineering Bureau to work both inside and outside the port, so that the ships could escape as soon as possible. The "Dalian Maru" icebreaker was chartered by the Haihe Engineering Bureau on the 22nd and worked on breaking ice from outside Dagukou inwards. By the evening, it had worked for 27 hours, only breaking open seven nautical miles, with another ten nautical miles remaining to the distressed ships. However, the weather changed, and the ice froze as it was broken, making it difficult to succeed. As of the evening of the 22nd, a total of 26 ships were trapped outside the port, and eight ships were trapped inside the port. The total loss of passengers and cargo for all ships in the past two weeks has reached 1.5 million. The Zhengji Company alone has lost 400,000. If rescue is delayed, the losses will be even greater.

<p>Tianjin: The "Shunli" ship of the Zhengji Company has been trapped outside Dagukou for more than ten days, and food supplies have been exhausted. Eight crew members and passengers formed a suicide squad to walk on the ice to Tanggu. They walked for a total of 31 hours before finally arriving. Three passengers fell behind and went missing along the way, their fate unknown. The other five also suffered frostbite on their hands and feet. The "Chang'an" ship, due to lack of food, tried its best to break the ice on the 22nd and sailed inward from outside the port, advancing 20 nautical miles. However, its paddle wheels were broken, and it stopped again 12 nautical miles from outside the port. The Japanese ship "Changcheng Maru" gathered more than 150 workers from Tanggu on the 22nd and brought enough coal and food to the ships outside the port for relief. However, they were blocked by ice floes and had to return. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Establishment of the Spanish Left-Wing Cabinet <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>After the news of the Spanish Congressional re-election result, where left-wing parties won a landslide victory with 237 seats, the national political situation suddenly became tense. Fascist military leaders were plotting a revolt. The cabinet led by Freedom Party leader Valadares, appointed by the central government, had to resign due to the impact of the general election results. Succeeding it was the Asana cabinet, organized by the leader of the left-wing Republican Party. The new cabinet is quite representative of the united colors of the left-wing Republican Party, the left-wing Popular Front Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. It is the manifestation of a mixed regime of the middle and small property classes and the worker-peasant class. At a time when the atmosphere of right-wing dictatorial politics is prevalent throughout Europe, the emergence of this cabinet is truly noteworthy.</p>
<p>If we want to understand the background of the emergence of this cabinet, we should seek it in the economic organization of Spain. The economic structure of Spain is quite similar to that of Tsarist Russia before the revolution. The national land is concentrated in the hands of a small number of old nobles. As for the peasants, apart from tenant farmers and semi-self-cultivating farmers, the number of landless, impoverished farmers alone reaches more than three million. They all rely on working as laborers for large landowners to barely make a living. Since the world economic crisis wave invaded, the lives of farmers have become increasingly difficult. Therefore, since the establishment of the republican system in 1931, the central issue in Spain has been how to realize the principle of "land to the tiller." The improvement of the purchasing power of the general population, the stabilization of the financial situation, and the increase in fiscal revenue all depend on this.</p>
<p>The aforementioned problems in agriculture are the most difficult to solve, and the resulting instability has affected the industrial sector. In recent years, strikes, disturbances, demonstrations, and parades have emerged one after another in various parts of Spain. Under this situation, the cabinet has collapsed again and again, and the intensification of party struggles has become a natural trend.</p>
<p>After the right-wing Lerroux cabinet was established in early May of last year, it caused more intense riots everywhere because it had no way to solve the unemployment problem. As a result, left-wing parties such as the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and syndicalist organizations established a unified front due to common interests and goals. At the same time, the right-wing People's Action Party also formed an alliance with the central faction and publicly declared that "What Spain needs now is God and the true talents to serve the country. The group program of the right-wing and central factions is to do their best to suppress the revolutionary groups that launched the rebellion in October 1934." However, in this kind of confrontation, the right-wing camp is still not as organized as the left-wing.</p>
<p>The inevitable victory of the left-wing parties in this general election was determined by the objective situation. However, the establishment of this left-wing regime still has a difficult future. If the current President Zamora is forced to resign, then a coup in the future will inevitably be difficult to avoid. The final outcome depends on the attitude of Britain and the major powers of Europe. If the left-wing regime can gradually stabilize, the first to feel threatened will be the military dictatorial regime of Portugal. The impact of this may cause major changes in the European situation is also unknowable.</p>

<p>Tokyo: Ambassador Arita made the following remarks upon taking office: The fundamental policy towards China will not change due to the change of ambassadors. China and Japan should be aware of the overall situation in East Asia and, based on the spirit of mutual trust and the long-term plan of a century, realize an unshakable partnership. Also, the Nanjing conference is not yet being considered and will be negotiated based on how the Chinese side acts. When negotiating, of course, Japan's three principles will be the foundation, but there is no intention to put forward a specific plan immediately. (Den-tsu dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>London: The transfer of British Ambassador to China, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, to Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the promotion of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to Ambassador to China have come as a surprise to many. Sir Cadogan's career in China is highly valued by the Foreign Office, and he has not been in the Far East for long, and his sudden recall has prevented him from fully realizing his ambitions, so everyone is very disappointed. The Chinese side is very happy about Sir Cadogan's transfer to Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, saying that this shows that the British government is now paying more attention to Chinese affairs. Members of Parliament who are concerned about Far Eastern affairs have long felt that the China section of the Foreign Office needs to add first-class talents who are familiar with the current situation in China, and this is very difficult to obtain. Now that Sir Cadogan has been transferred to the department, he will surely be able to perform his duties happily. It is expected that there will be other transfers in the diplomatic world this year, but major decisions must wait until Sir Cadogan returns home before a decision can be made.

<h3 id="e32">Results of the Japanese General Election Announced: The Constitutional Government Party Achieves an Unprecedented Victory, Occupying 205 Seats in the National Assembly, and the Political Situation May Thus Reach Stability <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The vote count of the general election is complete, and the results show the number of seats won by each party as follows: Constitutional Government Party 205, Seiyukai 174, Showakai 20, National League 15, Social Mass Party 18, Independents 25, other factions 9, totaling 466. (Twenty-second Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Constitutional Government Party, the ruling party of Japan, has won the general election. Out of the 466 seats in the Lower House, the Constitutional Government Party is expected to secure 205 seats. Adding the seats of the Showakai, which supports the government, and the National League Party, the government should have a majority of 14 seats. According to the latest report, the number of seats for each party is as follows: Constitutional Government Party 205, Seiyukai 174, Social Mass Party 18, Showakai 20, National League 15, Independents 34. (Twenty-second Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This general election will conclude tomorrow, and the distribution of power among the political parties will be determined accordingly. Regarding the political situation after the general election, regardless of the power of the parties, the opinions of the military's central leadership will still be the guiding principle. That is, the expansion of the Soviet Far East military and offensive military preparations by Army Minister Kawashima, the frequent incidents of border disputes in Manchuria and Mongolia, the Nanjing government's attitude toward Japan as the Nanjing Conference approaches, the current situation in North China and Inner and Outer Mongolia, and the development of the Chinese Communist Party's northward advance, the deepening of extraordinary circumstances, and the specific attitude the Imperial Army should take, etc., all need to be decided. Therefore, military councilors have also individually exchanged opinions. However, after the general election, it seems that they have actively advised Prime Minister Okada on the need to establish a strong and effective cabinet to overcome the extraordinary situation. Army Minister Kawashima's decision reflects the Army's internal demand to open up the current situation, and it also strengthens internal control. On the other hand, if the Constitutional Government Party wins the general election, then the national unity cabinet theory advocated by Education Minister Kawasaki will inevitably face even greater pressure and unfold. Due to these intense demands from both internal and external sources, Prime Minister Okada has fallen into a state of having to reorganize the current cabinet. There are even rumors of the Prime Minister resigning, so the future political situation will revolve around the theory of cabinet reshuffle. (Twenty-second Denstu Telegram)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Seiyukai President Suzuki Kisaburo suffered a crushing defeat in the general election and failed to be elected. The party's internal structure is greatly shaken, as the loss of a party president has never happened in Japanese constitutional history. Within the Seiyukai, there is increasing criticism of Secretary-General Matsuno and the election committee, and some even advocate replacing the president. Even if the vote count on the 22nd results in the party taking first place, the issue of the president will inevitably cause confusion within the party. Although Seiyukai member Kawaguchi Yoshihisa, who was elected in the same election, will resign his seat and cede it to Suzuki, whether this is legal is still debatable. Even if this succeeds and Suzuki is elected, a major stain will never be erased. Secretary-General Matsuno, General Manager Shimada, and other election committee members should bear responsibility. Before the election began, the world expected the Seiyukai to win a major victory, but the reason for this result is that President Suzuki's credibility has been swept away, which is quite obvious. Suzuki should consider the issue of his own advance or retreat. (Twenty-second Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Suzuki, the Seiyukai president, who was determined to lose the election, was resting in his room at his residence in Kudan, refusing visitors. Ando Masazumi, representing him, met with reporters and said that he felt sorry for the party members because he was unable to attend the campaign speeches due to neuralgia. As for the president, he is now looking forward to tomorrow's vote count, which seems more important than his own loss. Now, as a defeated general, he will not talk about military affairs. (Twenty-second Denstu Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The loss of Seiyukai President Suzuki has caused a great shock in various quarters. Kawaguchi Yoshihisa, who was a candidate in the same district and was elected, visited Hatoyama Ichiro today to express his intention to resign, saying that President Suzuki lost his seat, while he, a party member, has already been elected, and he is willing to cede the seat to the president. He does not know if there is a will to run. Hatoyama Ichiro immediately conveyed this to President Suzuki. The President immediately replied to Mr. Kawaguchi's request, saying that it would be inappropriate for him, with his sickly body, to have a party member resign and be elected himself. Therefore, Mr. Hatoyama conveyed this message to Mr. Kawaguchi again, but Mr. Kawaguchi's intention to resign is very firm, so the outcome is worth noting. (Twenty-second Denstu Telegram)</p>

<p>Tokyo: By last night, the results of 239 seats had been determined. The Constitutional Government Party had 109 seats, an increase of 36 seats from before. The Seiyukai had 87 seats, a loss of 30 seats from before. The Social Mass Party had 15 seats, an increase of 13 seats. Independents had 13 seats, an increase of 5 seats. The Showakai had 11 seats, a loss of 4 seats. The National League had 4 seats, a loss of 2 seats. The government is satisfied with the Constitutional Government Party having the most seats. Japanese newspapers, however, attach importance to the victory of the Social Mass Party. The Social Mass Party only put forward 30 candidates due to lack of funds, but 15 of these 30 candidates were elected, and they received a large number of votes. The Asahi Shimbun said that the rapid advance of the proletariat is clear evidence that voters recognize the existing political parties as incompetent and want to inject new air into the National Assembly. The victory of the Social Mass Party is also due to this decisive and clean election campaign, in which personal lobbying and written publicity have replaced the corruption of the past. (Twenty-second Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Abe, the leader of the Social Mass Party, smiled today and said that the election victory was unexpected. He said that this election can be said to be an ideal election, and his party, which has no money, was able to exert its full strength and achieve such a great victory. Twenty-five seats with negotiating power are still far away, so another decisive and fair election is needed to win about 30 seats. (Twenty-second Denstu Telegram)</p>

<p>London: The Naval Conference today again shows signs of breakdown. Representatives from the United Kingdom and the United States are both opposed to concluding a naval agreement that could involve European political disputes. According to reliable sources in Rome, Mussolini intends that Italy will not be willing to sign any maritime agreement unless the League of Nations ceases its sanctions against Italy or the United Kingdom withdraws its increased naval forces in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the French representative stated that he is still unwilling for Germany to join the conference. The United States has repeatedly stated that it will not sign any agreement related to European politics, and the British representative has also taken the same attitude. (Twenty-first National News Agency)</p>
<p>London: The protocol to conclude the London Naval Conference has encountered obstacles in its progress as a result of differences in political opinions between France and Italy. It is heard that the differences of opinion between the two countries arose over the wording of the protocol attached to the technical articles. British representative Eden, U.S. representative Davis, French representative Corbin, and Italian representative Grandi are currently engaged in bilateral talks to discuss the issue. What France wants is: 1. A clear statement that air, land, and naval armaments are mutually dependent. 2. The restoration of the broken Stresa Front. Italian representative Grandi stated that Italy does not currently wish to be involved in the issue of sanctions or the withdrawal of the British fleet from the Mediterranean. However, Italy is currently awaiting the completion of the protocol, and its wording must allow these political issues to be dealt with after the first word of the naval treaty is signed. U.S. representative Davis, in consideration of the policy of the U.S. government, does not wish to sign any document that could involve the United States in European politics. The whole matter now depends on British representative Eden mediating to resolve the differences of opinion on all sides. (Twenty-second Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Rear Admiral Pisia, the Italian representative to the Naval Conference, returned here yesterday from his country, bringing with him new instructions from Mussolini. A reporter from this agency recently visited a key figure in the Italian delegation, who stated, "The Italian delegation is prepared to cooperate with the representatives of the countries concerned in drafting a naval technical agreement and has no intention of raising objections on fundamental issues." The British and Italian representatives did not meet today and are not expected to meet until Monday next week. As for the issue of the tonnage of battleships, a person from the Italian delegation stated that the country may accept a tonnage of 35,000 tons, but it must be of a temporary nature so that it can be reduced within a short period of time. In other words, the tonnage of battleships must be limited, and other types of ships should be quickly limited. In addition, Italy will not object to the invitation of other countries to sign and participate, on the condition that Italy can submit reservations when the agreement is formally signed. As far as this agency's reporter knows, Italy's intention is to improve the general political situation since the implementation of sanctions by various countries and to use this as a condition for formal signing. This reservation does not insist on being included in the agreement, which is different from France's attitude, because the conditions proposed by France for drafting the agreement include all of the general reservations proposed by that country. (Twenty-second, Havas)</p>
<p>London: After consulting with Foreign Secretary Eden at noon today, French Chief Delegate to the Naval Conference, Ambassador Corbin, met with Eden again at 4:30 in the afternoon. Naval Minister Lord Monsell was also present. In the evening, members of the French delegation went to the Foreign Office again to hold a meeting with British experts. Both sides remained silent on the content of the talks. As far as this agency's reporter knows, the issue of battleship tonnage was not mentioned in today's talks, because there is a possibility of reducing this tonnage. France is now waiting for a reply from the U.S. delegation. Regarding the invitation to sign and participate in the future agreement, the United Kingdom advocates that the invitation should be made as soon as possible. France, on the other hand, believes that the invitation to Germany should be made only after the method of limiting naval armaments has been extended to air armaments (i.e., after the air security issue has been resolved). Currently, the United Kingdom has proposed a draft protocol, advocating that each signatory country entrust the United Kingdom to negotiate with countries that have not participated in the naval conference (including Germany) on the issue of signing and participating. However, this method was rejected by France. This matter was raised for discussion during the talks between the British and French representatives today, and it was agreed to draw up another compromise plan. It is heard that this plan has been drawn up by British and French experts and sent to Paris for approval by the French government. Naval conference personnel expressed optimism about the results of the talks between the United Kingdom and France, believing that Eden and Corbin have reached an understanding. Representatives of various countries believe that negotiations will continue in the next few days, and the period may be slightly longer than expected. Generally speaking, a naval technical agreement may be drafted around the 4th of next month. (Twenty-first Havas)</p>

The agreement is not only feared by Berlin, but Tokyo also holds the same view, regarding it as a serious threat to peace in the Far East. It is rumored that Herriot once told the French Chamber of Deputies that the German government issued a memorandum on May 25, 1935, stating to France that Germany did not regard the Franco-Russian agreement as a violation of the Locarno Pact. Today, a communiqué was specially issued here to respond to this, stating that this statement is not consistent with the facts.

This preparation work is of a military nature and began in January last year after the district held a plebiscite to decide to join Germany's territory.

He has now returned to his country. When he spoke to the press about his observations from this trip, he said, "I did not hold any official mission on this trip to Germany. Wherever I went, the German people showed a friendly feeling towards England, and their sincerity in wanting to maintain friendly relations with England and France was indeed urgent." As a former Air Minister, I took the opportunity to meet with General Goering and held several talks, all of which were pleasant and seamless. "I am grateful for General Goering's kindness in providing me with a private plane to travel, which made it convenient for me to visit many German airfields, and I was able to witness the development of Germany's aviation industry and understand the truth." Lord Londonderry also said that he had a two-hour meeting with German leader Hitler. "Most of the discussion revolved around political issues. On some points, my intentions and Hitler's were quite in line. From my observation, since the National Socialist Party took power in Germany, internal reforms have been evident, such as the rapid advancement of the construction industry and the tireless work of the people, which are all undeniable. As for the German land and air forces, they are currently very strong." In conclusion, he said that it is not easy to predict the future situation based on the current situation in Germany, but leader Hitler is now doing his best to manage it and ensure that a country with 65 million people is placed in a state of supreme rule, without being contrary to historical models and the rights it enjoys.

<h3 id="e49">Spain Issues Amnesty; Political Prisoners Released <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Madrid – Spanish President Zamora today signed an amnesty decree, as a result of which 30,000 political prisoners will be pardoned, all of whom participated in the 1934 revolution. The Standing Committee of the Congress authorized the government to issue martial law if necessary next month. Upon receiving the amnesty decree, prison officials immediately released all political prisoners. A large crowd stood at the prison gates to welcome them, vying to carry the released individuals on their shoulders in a parade through the streets. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid – The bill for amnesty for political prisoners is likely to be swiftly passed by the Congress today. The Standing Committee of the Congress has already endorsed this measure. If it can be passed today, tens of thousands of people will be released from prison tomorrow. Prisoners in the沃維杜 prison have already been ordered to be released from Madrid. However, two hundred ordinary criminals were not originally intended to be released, but they were inadvertently released at the same time as more than five hundred political prisoners due to a temporary oversight. This amnesty is a result of the left wing's overwhelming victory in the general election. (Reuter’s telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid – The government's proposed amnesty for political and social offenders has been passed by the Standing Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and President Zamora has recently signed it. The government will issue a nationwide order for immediate implementation. Former President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia,冈巴尼斯 (recently elected as a Deputy), and other members of the Provincial Council have been released from prison and have gone to Barcelona and the capital to meet with friends. In addition, the President signed another order to stop the return of property confiscated from various nobles after the revolution, and to stop the allocation of profits that should have been derived from this property to the original owners.

<h3 id="e52">Lecture on History: Foreign History (3) <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Professor Shen Gangbo, Central University</p>
<p>Now that historical concepts have been established, they can be used to discuss methodology. Middle school students do not study specialized history, nor do they have the tools for studying specialized history, so there is no need for the methods used for in-depth research. Now, let us put forward a few simple and easy-to-implement methods for reading textbooks, which may help you prepare for your schoolwork. This method is to help you solve the four W's in history: Who? When? Where? Why?</p>
<p>Reading history is like watching a play. To understand the plot of a play, you must first recognize the roles played by the actors; therefore, the names of people in history must be clearly remembered. However, foreign names, when translated into Chinese, are always a long string of irrelevant characters, which are twisted and difficult to remember. In addition, the translators each use local dialects, and the translated names are never uniform. For example, Wott, who successfully invented the steam engine, is translated as "瓦德" (Wǎdé) in the north, "華提" (Huá tí) in Hunan, and "屈特" (Qūtè) in Guangdong. One foreigner has three or four Chinese incarnations, making readers confused. The history of the Yuan Dynasty suffered from this great problem, which has caused us to this day not to have fully understood it. Contemporary Western history is also this point that students feel the most painful. To avoid this trouble, it is better to remember his original name. It is more accurate and easier than remembering the translated name. This is the way to solve the first W problem: Who?</p>
<p>The second is the problem of When. One by one, events in history are like grains of beads, and the years are like a long string that strings them together. If you can't find this thread, they become a plate of scattered beads, impossible to count. However, the dates formed by the topsy-turvy numbers are really difficult to remember one by one. If you use the method of association and comparison, it will be much easier. The method of association is to note the dates of major events in each century, arrange them in order, and remember which event came first and which came later—the order of events has a cause-and-effect relationship, which is easy to remember. Then choose a relatively easy-to-remember year, remember it firmly, and the dates of other events can be inferred approximately according to the order of events. Even if you can't say the exact date, you can at least indicate that it was in the first or second half of a certain century, which is barely enough. The method of comparison is to list the major events and famous people in foreign countries alongside the major events and famous people in China at the same time, and use familiar concepts to connect new concepts, so it is easy not to forget. For example, it is not easy to remember the years when the two famous Roman emperors Trajan and Marius Aurelius were in power—one from 98 to 117 in the first century, and the other from 161 to 180. If you remember that Trajan, who conquered Parthia, was at the same time as Ban Dingyuan, who showed his power in the Western Regions, and that the "philosopher emperor" Awreliws was at the same time as our great scholar Cai Yong, then you will not be confused about their times. There are a limited number of truly famous people in China and abroad, and there are not many major events. Spend a few days to associate and compare the important dates in a history textbook, and you can remember a general idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the problem of Where. The formation of nations, the division and merging of countries, the evolution of the economy, and the development of culture are all closely related to geography. Therefore, there is an old saying in the West that "geography is the mother of history," which shows that to study foreign history, one must understand foreign geography. There are several ways to practice this kind of knowledge: One is to combine foreign geography and foreign history taught in schools and corroborate each other. The second is to look at historical maps at any time when learning history, and examine the changes in borders, the migration of nations, the routes of transportation, and the centers of industry and commerce clearly. Fortunately, Westerners do not have the bad habit of constantly changing place names. For thousands of years, the names of large mountains, large rivers, major cities, and large towns have rarely changed. Unlike the historical geography of China, which is difficult to learn, as long as you have modern geographical knowledge, it is not difficult to read ancient maps. The third is to learn to draw sketches. Every time you learn about a new era, copy a map of that time, without being very precise and detailed, just outlining the general contours is enough. If you can't draw a map, at least fill in the printed blank map, because the terrain of mountains and rivers and the changes in territory cannot be firmly remembered just by looking at the map. Once you start drawing, you will naturally become familiar with it. Drawing a sketch takes only twenty or thirty minutes. Middle school students cannot say that they do not have this much time.</p>
<p>What I have just said are all the "obvious" considerations for examining historical facts. Now, let's move on to the method of researching "why so," which is to solve the problem of Why. There is no change in human affairs that is without cause. If you can't find its cause, you won't truly understand that thing. It is useless to just remember the plot. However, human affairs are complex, unlike the phenomena of the natural world, which are simple and straightforward. Often one thing contains countless remote and recent causes, some of which are obvious and some of which are hidden and difficult to detect. Even those that are revealed are often unimportant. When we encounter an event, we must analyze it clearly, grasp the main cause, and the remaining non-essential elements will be easily solved. Even if we skip them, it may not be impossible. For example, the great event of the Reformation, on the surface, seems to have been initiated by Luther and a few others. In fact, the corruption of the church was not a phenomenon unique to the sixteenth century, and Luther's ninety-five articles did not contain any novel arguments. How could it suddenly stir up all of Europe? The main cause of this movement was really outside of religion itself, belonging to politics, economics, and culture. In short, it was a manifestation of nationalism and ideological liberation. Otherwise, why would Europeans be so foolish as to shed blood for the disputes of a few priests? For example, the European War was really the inevitable result of the imperialism and economic policies of the great powers. Words like "Germany is the culprit" and "Britain is too cunning" are all propaganda texts during and after the war, and not the real reasons at all. Authors cannot be said to be without the common emotions of mankind. When describing history, they may unconsciously mix narrow ethnic prejudices with the spirit of extreme nationalism. We readers must examine the true causes and effects with a calm mind and must not let the author lead us astray.</p>
<p>Once the causes and effects of one event after another are clarified, we must further examine the relationship between this event and that event. Often, events in history are originally unrelated to each other, but then suddenly become related, or appear to be unrelated on the surface, but are actually subtly influenced. If every event has its own causes and effects and evolves independently, then how can there be a human society? For example, the European War was not a direct cause of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, but it was definitely related. May I ask, if Europe were at peace, would the Japanese dare to present the Twenty-One Demands? We must understand the interrelationships of various events in history in order to integrate and understand them and obtain a systematic and complete historical concept.</p>
<p>Speaking of the whole of history, some people may feel that the more ancient things are, the more difficult they are to understand, and the more difficult it is to see their relationship to the present. This is because the ancients had different environments and different psychology from us. To avoid this difficulty, you can turn a history upside down, from the present to the past, and look at it backwards, step by step. This kind of approach, from near to far, using the present to prove the past, is like holding a chain with interlocking links, counting them one by one, naturally finding its source. It is like a person suddenly meeting his ancestor from a thousand years ago, and at that time, he cannot see any resemblance to him. If the portraits of the ancestors of all generations are arranged in order, starting from his grandfather, and looked at one by one backwards, you can find the expressions and appearances that are inherited from generation to generation.</p>
<p>These methods for solving the four W problems are all for individual self-study. Now, let me introduce a method that allows the class to work hard to divide the labor and cooperate. That is, ask the teacher to divide a certain period, or the history of a certain country, or the course of a major event, into many related sub-items, give each student one, and ask him to go down to the class to freely turn the books and look at the notes to do the topic well. In class, every hour, or every week, take out a few minutes, and call on students in turn to read aloud the answers they have prepared on the spot. Then, the teacher will correct and supplement them, and the other students will take notes in summary. By doing this, each person will do no more than two or three articles per semester, but they will hear no less than dozens or hundreds of articles. They will not spend much time on their own and can obtain a lot of systematic knowledge. Isn't this an extremely convenient thing? When a foreign history book is finished in the future, these manuscripts can be organized, compiled, and edited to form a small Western Chronicle. If it is done well, it can even be published! Everyone, work hard! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e91">My Humble Opinion on Citizen's Protection Against Poison Gas <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jun</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The advancement of weaponry, from bows and arrows, knives and spears to guns and cannons, gunpowder, and further to airplanes, bombs, and poison gas, is constantly evolving and emerging endlessly. This is all due to human evolution and the flourishing of science. Future wars will not only pose a threat to those on the battlefield, but even those residing peacefully in cities will not be able to escape danger.</p>
<p>European and American countries, aware of this, have actively organized and trained citizens in political, military, educational, economic, transportation, and industrial centers for air raid and poison gas protection. In contrast, although our country has some exercises, the surface-level enthusiasm during the exercise period is quite intense (such as the speeches of propaganda teams, the special editions of newspapers, and the special issues of magazines). However, once the period passes, the practical work disappears without a trace and is met with indifference. Articles on poison gas and air raid protection are also rare. It must be understood that the issue of air raid and poison gas protection cannot be solved in just one period of time. It is essential to pay more attention to it during peacetime.</p>
<p>II. The Concept of Poison Gas</p>
<p>The power of airplanes goes without saying, but the harm of poison gas has a direct and profound impact on our densely populated cities, and it is imperative to have adequate knowledge of it.</p>
<p>So-called poison gas is not a purely gaseous substance, but rather encompasses solid, liquid, and gaseous substances that contain toxicity. Before we study poison gas, we must have a concept of what it is, and we must also know its history and the scope of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>III. A Brief History of Poison Gas</p>
<p>Four thousand years ago, the Yellow Emperor fought Chiyou at Zhuolu, and Chiyou created fog to resist the war. The fog he created was likely a type of poison gas, which was the beginning of poison gas. Its inability to spread and evolve was due to the lack of successors to continue the research.</p>
<p>In 46 BC, the Spartans of Greece soaked wood in sulfur and rosin and burned it, producing a foul-smelling smoke to suffocate the enemy defending the city, thereby breaching the city.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the European War, European and American countries had twice resolved to prohibit the use of poison gas (the Hague Treaties of 1898 and 1907). However, in the middle of the European War (1915), the Germans used it on a large scale, which aroused the attention of the world.</p>
<p>IV. A Future Perspective on Poison Gas</p>
<p>Since the European War, countries have again proposed a ban on poison gas warfare, but upon closer examination, if war breaks out again, the use of poison gas weapons will not be restricted by a mere piece of paper.</p>
<p>In 1920, the British Prime Minister delivered the following speech in a meeting: "As long as poison gas remains in the arsenal of other powers, we must not abandon it. Moreover, poison gas combat teams now occupy an important part in the armies of the United States, France, Italy, and other countries, and they are experimenting with the practical methods of poison gas. If our country (Britain) were to abandon it, it would be tantamount to treating our military preparations as child's play. Based on the experience of the European War, taking this risk is pure madness."</p>
<p>In 1922, the American Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering magazine stated: "The decision of the disarmament conference to prohibit poison gas warfare is limited to paper. If another war occurs, the use of poison gas in combat cannot be prevented. This conference did not adopt the views of poison gas warfare and experts in the manufacture of poison gas, but only the views of outsiders and the general public, denouncing poison gas warfare as a scientifically cruel and improper application, which is a major mistake. We should continue to study poison gas."</p>
<p>The Soviet military theorist Fuchiman also said: "If a country does not have poison gas warfare, then it is not worthy to say that it is prepared for war. An army that has not undergone poison gas training is not worthy to be called a modern army."</p>
<p>Based on the above points, the application of poison gas in future wars is inevitable.</p>
<p>V. The Severity and Scope of Poison Gas</p>
<p>The magnitude of the effectiveness of poison gas: during the years when poison gas was used in the European War, the general public had a terrible perception of it. However, after the end of the war, a comprehensive study of soldiers from various countries who died from poison gas injuries averaged no more than 2%. Deaths from injuries caused by other weapons were 30%. By comparison, poison gas only killed one-fifteenth as many as other weapons.</p>
<p>Here are a few main uses of poison gas for study: Forcing the enemy to wear masks to reduce their combat effectiveness. Attacking enemy positions or bunkers to prevent the enemy from holding them and forcing them to abandon them. Contaminating important areas to prevent the enemy from occupying or passing through them. Covering our army's advance or retreat. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>X. Transportation in Ningxia</p>
<p>For land transportation, there are three main highways in Ningxia: the Ninglan Road, the Ningbao Road, and the Ningping Road. The Ninglan Road starts from the south gate of the Ningxia provincial capital, passes through Ningshuo, Guangwu, Zaoyuan, Shikong, Zhongwei, and Xinbaozi, and enters Jingyuan County in Gansu Province, with a total length of 520 li. The Ningbao Road starts from the north gate of the Ningxia provincial capital, passes through Ligangbao, Pingluo, Shizuishan, crosses the river via Wangyuandi to Jinsimiao, crosses the river again, passes through Sanshenggong, Tianxingquan to Wulahe, and borders Suiyuan, with a total length of 640 li. The Ningping Road starts from Shikong on the Ninglan Road, crosses the river via Zhongning, Tongxincheng, Xinglongbao to Guyuan County in Gansu Province, with a total length of 230 li. There were originally eight branch lines: the Jinling Road, starting from the east gate of Jinji County, passing through Wuzhongbao, Dazhaizi to Lingwu County, with a total length of 45 li; the Ningling Road, starting from Ningshuo County, crossing the river via Hezhongbao to Lingwu County, with a total length of 40 li; the Ningshuo Road, starting from the south of the provincial capital, passing through Zhangzhengqiao, crossing the river via Hengcheng to Yanchi County, with a total length of 350 li; the Jinyu Road, starting from the south of Jinji County, passing through Gunquan, Weizhou to Yuwangcheng, with a total length of 220 li; the Ningzhong Road, starting from Shikong on the Ninglan Road to Zhongwei County, with a total length of 90 li; the Ningding Road, starting from the west of the provincial capital, passing through Xincheng to Dingyuanying, with a total length of 150 li; the Yanyu Road, starting from Weizhou on the Jinyu Road, passing through Huianbao to Yanchi County, with a total length of 200 li; the Jinning Road, starting from Gunquan on the Jinyu Road to Zhongning County, with a total length of 100 li. Recently, five more branch lines have been added: the Lingyu Road, starting from Huihanbao on the Jinling Road, passing through Huhuibao to Yuwangcheng, with a total length of 200 li; the Qinghong Road, starting from Qingshuibao, part of Xia County, passing through Ligangbao to Hongguangying, with a total length of 40 li; the Ninglin Road, starting from Shizuishan on the Ningbao Road, crossing the Yellow River twice to Ershili Liuzi to reach Linhe, with a total length of over 400 li; the Zhonghong Road, starting from Zhongwei County, passing through Mojialou, crossing the river to Hongduantou to reach Gansu, with a total length of over 200 li; the Yugu Road, starting from Yuwang County, passing through Liwangzhuang to reach Guyuan County in Gansu Province, with a total length of over 100 li.</p>
<p>Since 1933, the Ningxia Provincial Highway Administration has been responsible for the construction of these roads. The three main roads and the Jinling, Ningling, and Ningding branch roads have been roughly completed and opened to traffic. Currently, there are six Ford cars, sixteen Dodge cars, seven Studebaker cars, and one Chevrolet car, all of which are publicly owned and managed by the Provincial Highway Administration. Each vehicle has a carrying capacity of 1,100 to 2,000 catties and an average speed of 50 li per hour. Passenger fares are 3 cents per li, with 30 catties of luggage allowed. Freight fares are 1.6 cents per 100 catties per day. The north road cars depart on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th of each month. The south road cars depart on the 1st, 4th, and 7th of each month. In addition, there are other means of transportation, such as camels, mules, carts, and sedan chairs, etc. The freight rates are generally cheaper than those of cars, but the journey is slow and not economically viable in terms of time.</p>
<p>For waterway transportation, the Yellow River flows into Ningxia Province from Hongshan Gorge in Jingyuan. Above Zhongwei, it flows between two mountains, and the water is rapid, with ships traveling at about 20 li per hour. Below Zhongwei, the water flow is gentle, with ships traveling at 10 li per hour, and it is easy to run aground due to the riverbed's silting up. From Zhongwei, passing through Zhongning, Wuzhongbao, Ningshuo, Hengcheng, Qingshibao, Shizuishan, and Dengkou, these key ports are the places for loading and unloading passengers and goods. In addition to wooden boats, there are wooden rafts and leather rafts as transportation tools, each with a load capacity of 20,000 catties. There are also small leather rafts, which are only used for short-distance transportation. If one takes a wooden boat and encounters upstream water, one must tie the rope along the bank and pull the boat with effort. A journey of 100 li can easily take three or four days, which is costly and uneconomical. Therefore, most people still transport goods by land.</p>
<p>XI. "The Yellow River Benefits Ningxia"</p>
<p>Ningxia is located in the Hetao Plain, with thousands of miles of fertile land. The soil quality is even better than that of the former Hetao. Agriculture and animal husbandry are both suitable. The terrain of Ningxia is high in the southwest and low in the northeast. The Yellow River flows northeast from the Qingtong Gorge exit of Helan Mountain. The water flow is gentle, winding through Zhongwei, surrounding it as Hetao. Therefore, digging ditches to divert water for farming and irrigation is easy, and the water conservancy is smooth, benefiting from natural advantages. Canal affairs are developed, and agriculture and animal husbandry are superior to the northwest, which is not without reason. "The Yellow River brings a hundred harms, but only benefits Ningxia" is indeed not a fabrication. The ten major canals in the province are listed below.</p>
<p>Tanglai Canal (also known as Tang Canal): The canal mouth is opened from within the Qingtong Gorge of Dabaobao in Ningshuo County, flows west of the provincial capital, and flows north to Shangbaozhabao in Pingluo County, merging into the West River, with a length of over 320 li, irrigating over 179,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Hanyan Canal: The canal mouth is opened from Erdaohe in Chenjunbao in Ningshuo County, flows east of the provincial capital, and flows north to Wangchengbao in Ningxia County, merging into the West River, with a length of 195 li, irrigating over 128,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Qing Canal: The canal mouth is opened from Ma Guanxie of Dabaobao in Ningshuo County, reaches Songchengbao, merges into Tang Canal, with a length of 72 li, irrigating over 16,200 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Huinong Canal (formerly Huang Canal): The canal mouth is opened from Gangjiazui in Hanbabao, flows to Weizhabao in Pingluo County, merges into the Yellow River, with a length of 262 li, irrigating over 110,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Changrun Canal: The canal mouth is opened from Liushanzi in Tongjibao in Ningxia County, flows to Yongpingbao, merges into the Yellow River, with a length of 136 li, irrigating over 1,690 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Hedong Qin Canal (also known as Qin Family Canal): The canal mouth is opened from Qingtong Gorge in Lingwu (now Jinji), flows to the north gate, drains into Pang River, with a length of 150 li, irrigating over 70,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Hedong Han Canal (also known as Han Bo Canal): Located in Jinji County, the canal mouth starts from Qingtong Gorge, adjacent to the Qin Canal mouth, flows to Hujiapu in Lingwu, drains into Lao River, with a length of 100 li, irrigating over 125,800 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Hedong Tianshui Canal: Located in Hezhongbao, Ningxia County, it draws water from the Qingshuigou of Qin Canal in Lingwu and the return water of Han Canal in Jinji County, flows through Shijiachang and merges into the Yellow River, with a length of over 30 li, irrigating over 6,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Meili Canal: The canal mouth is opened from the end of Shilongkou under Xishapo in Zhongwei County, flows to Shikongsi Fort, with a length of 200 li, irrigating over 45,000 mu of fields.</p>
<p>Qixing Canal: The canal mouth is opened from Quanyanshan in Ninganbao in southern Henan of Zhongning County, flows to Zhangenbao, with a length of 140 li, irrigating over 27,800 mu of fields.</p>
<p>In addition to the above ten major canals in Ningxia Province, there are numerous branch canals with varying situations. For example, Pang Canal is located at Wenjiaqiao in northern Pingluo County. The old Tie Canal is drawn from the Daba Tang Canal from south to north to Hanbabao. The new Tie Canal is drawn from the old Tie Canal from south to north to Qing Canal, with lengths ranging from several tens of li. In addition, the newly opened Yunting Canal in the province has achieved significant results in military and civilian reclamation.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Ice at the Mouth of Dagu Gets Even More Solid; 25 Freighters and Passenger Ships are Frozen; Tianjin Shipping Industry Telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation for Help <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Telegraph: The ice at the mouth of Dagu had partially thawed last week due to warmer weather. However, since the 16th of this month, the weather has suddenly changed again, and the easterly wind has intensified, causing the ice floes in Bohai Bay to be agitated by the wind and all accumulate near the mouth of Dagu. This has caused the previously melted ice to freeze again and the unmelted ice to become even thicker. As of the 19th, the highest ice reached over ten feet, extending over two hundred feet, and the sea surface within 250 li outside of Heigu was blocked as if by an ice-covered landmass. Ships arriving outside the harbor were all frozen. By the 20th, a total of 25 ships could be seen on the sea surface, including nine Chinese passenger and freight ships, eight Japanese ships, and the rest from other countries. The Haihe Engineering Bureau has continuously dispatched the Qingling and Meiling icebreaker ships to the harbor entrance in an attempt to provide assistance, but the smaller ship size and fragile construction have rendered them unsuccessful. The Bureau had rented a British Marra icebreaker ship for three days to try to work outside the harbor, at a daily rental fee of 1,400 yuan. The three days of work, starting from the 18th, were quite effective. However, as of noon on the 20th, the rental period expired, and the Engineering Bureau terminated the rental due to excessive expenses, planning to abandon the ships frozen outside the harbor and not provide assistance. Tianjin's Chinese and foreign shipping companies believe that each ship bears over 1.5 million yuan in river work donation fees to the Bureau each year. According to regulations, rescue should be provided in case of disaster, and even if there is no donation, assistance should be provided according to maritime practice, rather than sitting idly by. Therefore, a special meeting was held at the Tianjin Shipping Company on the 20th to discuss solutions. It was decided at the time to send representatives to the Haihe Engineering Bureau and the Tianjin Customs Port Affairs Department to negotiate directly, requesting them to quickly provide assistance. It was also decided to telegraph the Ministry of Transportation, requesting the Ministry of Finance to order the Tianjin Customs and the Haihe Engineering Bureau to quickly dispatch icebreaker ships or continue to rent the large icebreaker ships from foreign companies for rescue.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 19th, Wang Gengsan, manager of the Tianjin Shipping Company, inspected the situation of the ships trapped outside the harbor on the company's Tianli icebreaker ship. Near Heigu outside the harbor, he was unable to proceed further due to the excessive amount of icebergs. At that time, he witnessed that the rudder of the Sanxing was damaged, the two holds of the Fengli were flooded, two wings of the ship were lost, and the front hold of the Yongheng was leaking. The remaining ships were either lacking coal, water, or food, or were on the verge of danger. In addition to providing coal, water, and food to nearby ships, the ship also held an emergency meeting on the ice floes. Afterwards, he made three suggestions to his colleagues and the Customs: 1. Advise ships preparing to come to Tianjin to delay departure or change course. 2. British icebreaker ships with a draft of 17 feet cannot implement rescue at Dagu. The current emergency response should task the Haihe Engineering Bureau ships to concentrate all their efforts on rescuing the ice-bound ships. 3. Hope that the Tianjin Shipping Association will launch a final rescue effort, compile a statistical table of losses from the Dagu ice disaster, and gather related industries to put forward effective recommendations.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, Okamura, the head of the Tianjin Military Special Affairs Agency, accompanied by several Japanese reporters, rented a Tianxing ship to investigate the situation of the trapped ships outside the harbor. They returned to Tianjin at 2 p.m. According to reports, the situation of the ships trapped outside of Dagu has indeed reached a serious state. It is said that the Yushun ship of the China Merchants Bureau, which was trapped near Tanggu, has been in the most critical condition for one month and six days. Most of the other ships have also been trapped for more than half a month. The average loss per ship per day is over 600 to 1,000 yuan. The goods carried by the freighters have suffered even greater losses. If 25 ships are considered, the daily loss reaches over 30,000 yuan, which is truly a catastrophe for the shipping industry. Attached is the letter from the shipping industry to the Customs Engineering Bureau on the 20th: "Dear Sirs, Recently, various shipping companies of this association and other Chinese and foreign colleagues have stated that the Dagu ice disaster is becoming increasingly serious. The Tianxing ship of the Tianjin Shipping Company inspected on February 19 and found that a total of 25 ships, large and small, were surrounded by solid ice. Among them, the three ships Sanxing, Fengli, and Yongheng are in the most dangerous situation, fully loaded with passengers and goods, and the ships are leaking water. We request that you take steps to rescue them. We received a reply from your Bureau stating that the Christian Marra icebreaker ship had been rented for another three days until 11 a.m. on the 20th of this month. The serious problem remains of how to get the many ships trapped in Dagu and on the way to Dagu to break through the encirclement and avoid danger. This matter was submitted to an emergency meeting of our association, which unanimously agreed that the only way to address the current crisis is to request your Bureau to take responsibility and provide a final effective rescue, either by continuing to rent the Marra ship or by renting another powerful icebreaker ship (such as the Dalian Maru or Fengtian Maru). At the same time, your Bureau's icebreaker ships should concentrate all their efforts on continuously working to release the trapped ships near Dagu one by one, so as to fulfill your Bureau's original intention of providing protection. It is true that the ships initially relied on your Bureau's rented icebreaker ships to break the ice and assist them in sailing to Tianjin. Then, because the Marra ship's rental expired and it left Dagu, they suffered another disaster. Good intentions have turned into bad results, which your Bureau would not be willing to do. This letter is sent to you in the hope that you will quickly take steps to rescue them. Chinese and foreign shipping companies will be eternally grateful. To the Haihe Engineering Bureau."</p>

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Since taking office, Chairman Yu Xuezhong of the Gansu Provincial Government has been very concerned about the people's livelihood. The following is a record of recent measures:</p>
<p>Provincial Order for Joint Office</p>
<p>Gansu Provincial Government Chairman Yu Xuezhong, considering that joint office is a good way to concentrate power and increase administrative efficiency, has carefully studied and actively prepared since taking office. Now that everything is in order, he specifically proposed it for discussion at the 381st Provincial Government meeting. It was decided to implement it from March 1st. All preparatory matters shall be discussed and decided upon by the Secretary-General and the heads of the various departments.</p>
<p>Preparing for Afforestation along the Yellow River: The Provincial Government has already drafted a plan for afforestation along the Yellow River and submitted it to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The afforestation funds are set at 240,000 yuan. In addition to the Ministry of Industry's subsidy of 60,000 yuan, the remaining 180,000 yuan will be raised by the province to proceed. This afforestation project is of great importance to the future of the people's livelihood and should be actively carried out. In addition to ordering the Department of Construction to take the lead in accordance with the plan, efforts are now being made to raise the necessary funds to facilitate gradual implementation in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>Actively Developing Water Conservancy: The National Economic Committee has agreed to allocate 500,000 yuan in water conservancy funds for the development of water conservancy in Gansu Province to facilitate progress. However, in reality, only 200,000 yuan of water conservancy funds have been allocated to the province. Work began last year, and the Tao Hui, Tong Hui, Yongfengchuan, and other canals have all been surveyed and are under construction. However, due to the cold weather, work was temporarily suspended. After Chairman Yu took office, he paid close attention to water conservancy, deeply believing that this project is of great importance to the people's livelihood and rural economy. As the spring thaw is approaching, those that have already started should continue, and those that are determined to be repaired should be promoted separately to meet the original plan and benefit the people's livelihood. He specifically telegraphed Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Committee, requesting that the 300,000 yuan of water conservancy funds that have been approved but not yet allocated to the province be allocated as soon as possible. Regarding the case of repairing the Wuwei and Zada canals, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to hand it over to the National Government to order the Economic Committee to handle. Chairman Yu also believes that it is necessary to advance the process and telegraphed Song Ziwen to plan and implement it as soon as possible to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Usury: The Provincial Government believes that the legal interest rate for loans is fixed, and heavy exploitation is strictly prohibited. The practice of usury in various counties of the province is often heard, especially in the Hexi Ganliang area. In terms of interest rates, it is heard that the monthly interest rate is 7 or 8 cents or more per yuan, with some as high as 2 or 3 jiao or even doubling the principal. Some even calculate interest daily and accumulate it. It is truly shocking. In terms of exploitation, some lenders give only 70 or 80 yuan for every 100 yuan borrowed, deducting 20 or 30 yuan as interest. Some lend grain during the spring plowing season and collect agricultural products at predetermined extremely low prices upon maturity. Even more, some use the debtor's year-round employment to offset interest. All kinds of methods are used to the extreme of exploitation. As a result, the year-round hard work of the general poor is not enough to satisfy the greed of the rich and powerful, leading to the sale of fields and property, and the selling of children and mortgaging of wives, which deeply affects the social economy and the people's lives. Although the government has repeatedly prohibited it, the counties have failed to enforce it, and the accumulated malpractice has not been completely eliminated, which is truly heartbreaking. The Provincial Government has decided to reiterate the ban. All existing usurious loans should be immediately revised to establish legal contracts. The maximum annual interest rate shall not exceed 20%. If they continue to be unrepentant and engage in usurious lending again, once discovered or reported, they will be severely punished according to law and will not be tolerated. It is heard that a notice has been issued to all counties and is being widely publicized.</p>

<p>Lanzhou Radio News, north of the Kunlun Mountains' Toguz-Darya, that is, south of the northern Cold Ridge and Ruoqiang, lies a virgin land. Within this area of five hundred square miles, the natural environment is one of continuous, interconnected peaks; dense, towering forests; and ground-covering vines and snow-capped mountains intertwined. Although the area is vast and the variety of life abundant, even geographical experts lack detailed reports. In the past, Ruoqiang was a vital route from Dunhuang to the southern Tian Shan Road, and Bagar was a shortcut from there to Tibet. However, these routes became submerged, and the latter was destroyed by Dong Fuxiang, cutting off all human access. Initially, it was thought that this area was a world of only birds and beasts, devoid of human habitation. However, seven or eight years ago, a certain woman, after arguing with her husband, angrily entered the mountains, unable to find her way back. She encountered a wild man who took her to his home. After several years, she escaped and recounted her experience vividly, but it was dismissed as a tall tale. The year before last, a flash flood washed several corpses down from the mountains. Residents examined their clothing and confirmed it matched the woman's description, causing some surprise. Later, upon examining the corpses, they were found to have furry tails, four or five inches long, causing great astonishment. It was then realized that the area indeed had inhabitants. Subsequently, the matter was reported to Kumzar, and several young explorers, including Molana, eager to investigate, entered the mountains last summer, carrying provisions and weapons. After three days of travel, they spotted smoke rising from the forest and faintly heard the sounds of chickens and dogs. They sought a path and, upon reaching the edge of the forest, found a sudden clearing, revealing a vast plain, expansive lakes, and earthen mounds surrounding a large settlement. Approaching closer, the wild men, mistaking them for invaders, sounded the alarm. Suddenly, over a hundred men, wielding rattan shields and spears, came to fight. Molana and his companions prostrated themselves, raising their hands to indicate no harm. The wild men surrounded them, their language and customs complex and obscure. Speaking slowly and repeatedly, both sides managed to communicate. They were then led to the chieftain's house, where a sheep was slaughtered for a feast, and over a dozen leaders were summoned. Their clothing was woven from wild hemp, topped with swan-feather cloaks. When questioned about their way of life, they replied that they lived by hunting and herding, still unaware of farming. Their religious beliefs were very faint, barely knowing what scriptures were. It was also said that most of the people in that land had tails, with those without tails considered noble and those with tails who had them cut off regarded as the lowest of the low. Therefore, those serving the chieftain had large, protruding buttocks, while above the head, they were still human. According to the chieftain, his tribe was just a small branch of this tailed nation, which was ruled by a king who lived in a city built of reeds, commanding tens of thousands of people, the king of a hundred kings. In his house, there were several pots of snow lotus, whose fragrance was intoxicating, said to be a gift from the king. Molana and his companions stayed for six days, teaching the chieftain the art of brewing wine and smoking tobacco as a reward. The chieftain was overjoyed, and upon their departure, he gifted them with dried meat and personally escorted them for dozens of miles, earnestly pointing out the way before bidding farewell. Thus, the existence of this eastern secret nation spread throughout the northern and southern Tian Shan roads. (February 18th)</p>

<p>Along the banks of the Huangpu River in this county, fishermen pay taxes to the government and obtain fishing rights as a means of livelihood. However, since last year, a large number of Jiangbei fishing boats have suddenly arrived in the Desheng Port area and are occupying fishing grounds. Local fishermen who pay taxes report that their fishing rights are being infringed upon. They have reported this matter to Jiang Yuezhang, the standing director of the inland river branch of the Fishermen's Association, requesting relief. Jiang has relayed the situation to the county government, requesting that the issue be stopped. Subsequently, County Magistrate Li instructed the First National Tax Collection Office to investigate and reply, confirming that those fishermen did indeed pay taxes. Considering that the issue concerned fishermen who had already paid national taxes, he immediately instructed He Runzhang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Shen Fuyun, the chief of the First District, to properly stop this practice and report the handling situation.</p>

<p>Wang Guo, an elderly farmer over sixty years old from Yangjiajiao in the seventh district of the county, had some savings. She hired Zhu Laotai from the same village as a maid. Before the Lunar New Year, Wang Guo buried two hundred silver dollars she had saved in the base of the wall inside her house. Zhu Laotai learned of this and developed ill intentions. Taking advantage of Wang Guo's absence while she was out enjoying the holidays, Zhu Laotai colluded with Wang Sheng and her lover, Wang A'jin, to completely dig up and divide the hidden silver. Later, the old woman heard rumors, checked, and found that the silver dollars had vanished. She immediately reported the incident to the local police station, who arrested the three individuals and, along with the plaintiff, sent them to the county bureau for investigation.</p>

The participants stood waiting in the rain. When the ceremony began, Chairman Guan read the will, and everyone followed aloud. Unexpectedly, Director Guan could not recite it, and the audience could not follow. Representatives from various departments, students from various schools, and members of the public believed that Guan Jincheng, as the head of the Education Bureau and the chairman of the conference, did not adhere to the time, was careless with the will, and lacked decorum. The county party headquarters sent a letter to the county government yesterday, requesting severe punishment.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government considers Wuxi to be a crucial location connecting Beijing and Shanghai, bordering rivers and lakes. It is also a place with thriving commerce and industry and a large population. It plans to establish an Administrative Inspection Commissioner's Office to govern Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Yixing, Liyang, Changshu, and other eight counties. The commissioner will have the authority to oversee all administrative and security matters. The proposal has been submitted to the 808th Provincial Government Committee meeting for discussion and approval. It has also been decided to appoint Zang Qifang as the Administrative Inspection Commissioner and concurrent Security Commander of the Wuxi District. Commissioner Zang is a 43-year-old native of Gaiping, Liaoning, and a graduate of an American university. He has served as the mayor of Tianjin, special commissioner for party affairs in Harbin, and the Administrative Inspection Commissioner and Security Commander of the Yancheng District in Jiangsu Province since April 1934.

<p>At 9:30 PM on the 21st, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Wang Genhe, a resident of Mengyuan Alley, across from the Central Theater at the intersection of Wanqian Road outside the Guangfu Gate. Due to the strong wind and fierce flames, the fire spread rapidly, engulfing five other families residing in the same residence, including Gu Shouting, Sun Honggen, Xie Boqing, Qian Zhongying, and Xin Jintai. It also affected the adjacent Yutai Foreign Goods Store and Zhang's Bean Curd Shop. At the time of the fire, Gu Shouting himself was working as a tea server at the Su-Tai Hotel in Suzhou and was not at home. His wife, Zhu (35 years old), his son, Yusheng (6 years old), his eldest daughter, Hexian (16 years old), and his second daughter, A'san (13 years old), were all asleep. Upon hearing the alarm, they quickly got up and put on their clothes, but the staircase had already been burned through. Unable to jump down due to being almost naked, they could not escape and all four perished in the fire. Xin Jintai's mother, Zhong, who lived behind them, was 64 years old. She managed to escape in a panic after the fire broke out but suffered severe burns to her head. Her eight-year-old son, Zhaoxiang, was unable to escape due to the flames filling the house and also died in the fire. The area is far from the river, making it difficult to obtain water. As the fire raged, men frantically fled and cried out in despair. Gu Shouting rushed back home upon learning of the fire, only to find his wife and children all perished in the flames. Overwhelmed with grief, he fainted on the spot and was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei Shipping Company, Ningshao Shipping Company, and Taikoo Shipping Company increasing freight rates, the silk fabric, customs declaration, and other industries in this port sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward a letter to the four companies, urging them to promptly cancel the proposed increase. Subsequently, the four companies replied, still adhering to their original proposal. The Chamber of Commerce then appointed Chairman Wang Wenhan as a representative to go to Shanghai to discuss the matter with the four companies. Later, as Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association and manager of the Sanbei Company, happened to come to Ningbo on the 20th, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Wenhan, silk fabric industry representative Li Xianzhao, rice industry representative Yuan Qiwei, fresh and dried goods industry representative Mao Anqing, and others personally requested Yu to accept the cancellation of the freight rate increase. Yu replied that the Sanbei Company could maintain the original price, but it would also need to discuss with the other companies to reach a decision. For fresh and dried goods shipped on the Beijing ships, the amount was very small. The additional 20% on other incoming and outgoing goods will be temporarily recorded in the accounts, and he will provide a further reply after returning to Shanghai to negotiate with the three companies. Therefore, the future of this matter remains uncertain.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Italian King awarded the title of Knight Commander to philanthropist Lu Bohong, and a ceremony was held in the auditorium of Zhengxiu Middle School in the Southern City. The Italian Ambassador to China, Lo Jacono, presented the medal on behalf of the Italian King. The details of the grand occasion are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending: Over a thousand Chinese and foreign guests attended the ceremony, including Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Zhenwei Committee Chairman Zhu Qinglan, Central Disaster Relief Committee Director Wang Yiting, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jinjun, City Security Director Yang Hu, Bank of China General Manager Song Hanzhang, Local Association Chairman Du Yuesheng, City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting, and Qu Yingguang, Gu Jisheng, Zhu Zhiyao, Gu Xinyi, Chen Tiesheng, Xu Peihuang, Yao Mulian, Italian Ambassador Lo Jacono, Italian Consul General to Shanghai Nilong, Shanghai Regional Archbishop Hui Da, French Consul General to Shanghai Baudrais, Belgian Consul General to Shanghai Tan Erfu, Belgian Envoy Ji Youmu (representing Tan Erfu), officers of the Chinese Fleet, leaders of all churches in Shanghai, the entire faculty and students of Zhengxiu Middle School, and nuns from the monastery.</p>
<p>Medal Presentation Ceremony: During the medal presentation ceremony, the national anthems of China and Italy were played first. Then, Italian Ambassador Lo Jacono, on behalf of the Italian King, presented the Knight Commander medal to Lu Bohong. In his speech, he stated that the Italian King's awarding of the Knight Commander medal to Mr. Lu Bohong was sufficient to enhance the friendly affection between the people of China and Italy, and to further encourage the public to do good and encourage the clergy to diligently preach the gospel and seek happiness for the people. Mayor Wu then gave a speech saying that today, the Italian Ambassador, on behalf of His Majesty the Italian King, awarded Mr. Lu Bohong the medal, and Shanghai and its citizens share the honor. This is not only an acknowledgement by the foreign monarch of Mr. Lu Bohong's usual acts of courage, righteousness, and charity, but also strengthens the friendly relations between China and Italy.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's Speech: Italian Ambassador, Belgian Minister, Archbishops, Consuls, Ambassador Xu, Mayor Wu, and gentlemen, I am extremely honored to receive this medal from the Italian Ambassador on behalf of the Italian Emperor, and I am very grateful for the presence of all the officials and guests from all walks of life. While I respectfully accept this honor, I deeply feel ashamed. Serving society and managing charity and public welfare is our inherent duty and also the responsibility bestowed upon us by religion. I embraced this idea and founded the Catholic Progress Association to expand its effectiveness. I have devoted myself to this for over twenty years. In all the charity and public welfare undertakings run by the church in the missionary districts of various provinces in China, I have contributed my best and have never slackened. I am willing to support Italian churches, as the missionary districts are vast, such as in Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces, and there are many charitable, educational, and public welfare undertakings. In recent years, I have established the Zhengxiu Vocational Middle School and the Zhabei Mother's Heart Hospital, with the assistance of priests from the Salesians of Don Bosco in Italy and the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians nuns, who have come to China from afar to assist in everything, achieving remarkable results. Therefore, with various mutual aid efforts, the affection has become even closer. However, all of this is serving the Progress Association, that is, serving the Holy Church. I believe that this medal is an award from the Italian Emperor to the Progress Association, so I dare to accept it. In the future, I will work even harder on the various undertakings run by the Progress Association to repay the Italian Emperor's honor. Please, Italian Ambassador, convey my respect and sincere gratitude to the Italian Emperor. I am deeply moved." Afterwards, the ceremony was declared complete. Tea and refreshments were served, and Italian Ambassador Lo Jacono and Mayor Wu raised their glasses to congratulate Mr. Lu. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and then dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Soviet Union Print Exhibition Opens Yesterday; Over Two Hundred Attendees from Chinese and Russian Art Circles; Speeches by Sun Fo, Cai Yuanpei, and the Russian Ambassador <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Soviet National Print Exhibition was initiated by the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the Chinese Art Association, and the Chinese Literary Society. It was previously exhibited at the Central University Library in the capital last month, receiving great acclaim. Recently, all two hundred-plus works were brought to Shanghai and previewed a few days ago in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to welcome school groups to visit. The opening ceremony was held yesterday at 3:00 PM. The exhibition will close at 7:00 PM on the 26th of this month. During the exhibition period, admission is free and open to the public. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests: The venue was set up in the West Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA in the style of a tea party, with seating for about two hundred people. At 3:00 PM, the receptionists notified the guests who were previewing the exhibition in the East Hall to come to the West Hall. Among those present were Sun Fo, Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and President of the Legislative Yuan; Honorary Chairman of the Association and Russian Ambassador Bogomolov; Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica; Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University; Liu Yazi, Director of the Municipal Gazetteer; and over two hundred male and female guests from Chinese and Russian art circles. Mayor Wu Tiecheng also attended the event.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: First, Chairman Li Zhaohuan gave a speech, stating that today marks the opening of the Soviet National Print Exhibition in Shanghai, jointly initiated by the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the Chinese Art Association, and the Chinese Literary Society. The preparatory committee has been preparing for a week and previously invited the education community to visit. It will close at 7:00 PM on the 26th. This can only be described as a small-scale exhibition. It is hoped that a large-scale Soviet art exhibition will meet with us in the near future. We are infinitely welcome to have everyone here today. After the speech, Sun Fo, Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, was invited to speak.</p>
<p>Sun's Speech: Sun said in his speech that the prints exhibited today were collected by the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and brought to China for our viewing, and were prepared by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and other groups. They were exhibited in the capital last month, and all visitors praised them highly. The exhibition of Soviet cultural relics in China is a first and can provide much inspiration for Chinese culture and art. It is also the first project after the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association. Sun then introduced the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, saying that the Soviet Union and China occupy very important positions in Asia and were the first country to establish treaties with China. The relationship is long-standing, and the border stretches for thousands of miles. Unfortunately, the friendship between the two countries has not yet reached a state of full understanding and closeness. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, people in the Southeast have more estrangement from the Soviet Union, and some still have biased opinions about the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is planned to first engage in communication and mediation in the arts and culture between the two countries. Thus, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association was established in Beijing four months ago. If there is an opportunity, Chinese culture that can be introduced to the world will also be introduced to the Soviet Union, forming the foundation for a lasting peace of Sino-Soviet cultural integration. Recently, it is planned to establish a branch in Shanghai, which will surely carry forward and expand this. This exhibition is the first step of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and other organizations, and it is hoped that more guidance and support will be given. Then he introduced the Honorary Chairman of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, Russian Ambassador Bogomolov, to speak.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador's Speech: Bogomolov first expressed his gratitude to the four groups hosting the exhibition for holding the Soviet print exhibition in Shanghai. He hoped that this exhibition in Shanghai, one of China's cultural centers, would continue to be welcomed by the Chinese people as it was in Nanjing. He expressed agreement with Professor Xu Beihong's statement that "art is a performance of a country's life and a symbol of a country's thought." He hoped that in this current era of suffering, where the world is blinded by misunderstandings, this exhibition would allow the Chinese people to understand the Soviet Union. He continued, saying that among the attendees were many Chinese scholars and artists who were very familiar with Western art, but perhaps few understood Soviet art. One of the reasons for this was that the Soviet Union was isolated from the world in the years after the October Revolution. Secondly, the art after the Soviet Revolution was a new thing, completely different from Western art. He then clarified the realism and romanticism of art, stating that Soviet art is currently socialist realism. Bogomolov spoke in English for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Cai's Speech: Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, gave a historical account of printmaking, stating that China was the earliest originator of printmaking. China already had printmaking in the tenth century, while the West did not discover it until the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century, it gradually became widespread in Europe, such as Germany, Austria, and Italy. From the fourteenth century to the second half of the fifteenth century, it was the most prosperous era of European printmaking. Later, due to the advent of copperplate printing, it gradually declined. From the seventeenth century to the present, photography has also emerged to replace it. In conclusion, he said that Chinese printmaking has been greatly influenced by the West, and this exhibition will surely have a new impact on new works.</p>
<p>Xu's Speech: Xu Beihong also gave a brief speech from the perspective of an artist, stating that art must advance alongside revolution, otherwise Soviet printmaking would not have such achievements. He also said that Soviet printmaking master Favorsky had said at a welcome banquet in Moscow that in addition to welcoming him, he also welcomed Chinese artists and hoped that Chinese and Soviet artists would work together.</p>
<p>Viewing the Works: After the guests had some refreshments, they went to the venue to view the works. Some of the more than two hundred works had already been sold during the exhibition in Nanjing. Yesterday, Mayor Wu Tiecheng and five others purchased several more works.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Chinese Taxpayers' Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday; Three Principles Decided on Telephone Issues; Basic Usage Fee Should Be Reduced or Limited Number of Calls Increased; Prices Should Be Reduced Immediately When Net Profit Exceeds 10 Percent <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Usage Fee Should Be Reduced According to Increased Usage: The Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, in response to the demands of the Special District Telephone Problem Committee, the First Special District Citizens' United Association, and others, convened a taxpayers' meeting to fundamentally abolish the disguised price increase system of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Therefore, it convened an executive committee meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. More than twenty people attended, including Liu Zhongying, Yan Esheng, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, and Cao Zhigong. The Citizens' Association also sent Chen Jiufeng and Li Ao Kui to report. Xu Jijing chaired the meeting, and Tao Leqin took the minutes. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of convening the meeting. It was decided that Li Ao Kui should state that citizens throughout the city could not afford the telephone price increase and had sent letters requesting a serious protest. It was found that the Shanghai Telephone Company had made considerable profits over the years. The company currently has 36,000 users and has prepared equipment for 200,000 users. Regardless of its assets and expenditures, based on the general situation, due to equipment management, there must be at least an increase in unexpected expenditures. Therefore, the price increase is completely unreasonable. After discussion, it was resolved that, in addition to supporting the Chinese directors' proposal, the basic usage fee should be reduced, or the limited number of calls should be increased. After the new system is implemented, whenever the company's net profit exceeds 10 percent, prices should be reduced immediately. The more calls used, the usage fee should be reduced on a tiered basis. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Citizens' Association Convenes Telephone User Meeting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' United Association yesterday notified the district branches, stating, "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Special District Telephone Problem Committee, the disguised price increase of telephones in the special district has been met with opposition from merchants and residents throughout the city, who have appealed to the Municipal Council and various public groups to consider the difficulties of businesses and abolish the approved measures. However, the Municipal Council Board of Directors listened to the company's one-sided demands and insisted on a 1% official interest rate, resulting in no results from the appeals. After a joint meeting of various groups, it was decided to accept the company's proposal to charge three cents per call but strongly opposed the collection of monthly fees exceeding three cents. In addition to continuing to strive for this with the Municipal Council Board of Directors, and to improve the user organization, a joint meeting of users should be convened within a week, and the association will send personnel to provide guidance. Therefore, as the telephone price increase is a matter of vital interest to the citizens, you are requested to convene a general meeting of all users in the district within one week after receiving this notice and report in advance so that we can transfer the information and send personnel to attend as necessary."</p>

<h3 id="e145">Shanghai Municipal Council Election, British Community Plans Pre-Election <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the election of councilors for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement is scheduled for March 23rd and 24th. This year, due to the Japanese community's intention to compete in the election, the British community is now planning to hold a pre-election to select five British candidates so that they can unanimously vote for these five people, to avoid the risk of one or two of the five seats occupied by the British community in the Municipal Council being taken by others. This pre-election by the British community is actually a pioneering event in Shanghai's history. According to regulations, the British occupy five seats on the Municipal Council, while the Americans and Japanese each occupy two. This has been the case for many years. The only change occurred in 1932. This year, the Japanese have expressed their desire to obtain three seats, so the situation will change. Traditionally, more than five British people have joined the competition, and five of them have always been elected. In 1936, because the Japanese opposed one of the American candidates, the Americans only won one seat, and the remaining seat was won by a Dane. This year, the British community is afraid that too many people will join the competition and repeat the mistakes of the American community in 1932, so the British Community Election Committee is now planning to hold a pre-election to select five people from the ten candidates to be candidates for the Municipal Council, in order to avoid having too many candidates and dividing the votes. Two of the current British councilors are willing to run for re-election, namely Chairman Mr. Arnold and Mr. Puddefoot. The other candidates participating in the pre-election are Mr. Harris, Mr. Hickling, Mr. Hsu Shih, Mr. Keswick, Mr. McDonald, Mr. Marden, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Macnaghten, totaling ten people. The current councilors Lambe and Keiller are unwilling to be re-elected. The British Community Election Committee hopes to complete the pre-election within the next week. So far, only Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Keer Hang of Citibank are the American candidates. Mr. Fessenden is the current councilor. The other American councilor, Mr. Carney, is unwilling to be re-elected because he will soon be taking leave to return to his country. If a third person joins, the American community will also hold a pre-election. According to the British Community Election Committee, the taxpayers in the International Settlement who are qualified to vote include 934 British people, 893 Japanese people, 400 Americans, and 1,273 people from other countries. In the election last year, 775 Japanese people, 565 British people, and 247 Americans and other foreign residents voted. If the Japanese community puts forward three candidates this time to compete, then the British community's victory will depend half on the number of British votes and half on the attitude and number of votes of foreign residents other than the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e146">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Manager, Cai Zengji Discusses Talent Standards <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the employment of personnel by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, according to Mr. Cai Zengji, the company's general manager, yesterday, it is a common social custom that whenever there is a change of head or person in charge of an organization, recommendations pour in from all sides, and people seeking jobs come one after another. The intention to introduce and recommend talented people is commendable, but judging from the facts, if all those recommended by various parties are employed, even if more than ten more organizations are added to the original organization, it may not be possible to accommodate them. Therefore, I have always had a clear purpose for employment, that is, I believe that those seeking jobs should seek them on their own initiative, and whether or not they can be accommodated is up to me. Because in fact, I cannot accept them, so I cannot bend to human feelings and harm the public. I have worked in Shanghai for more than ten years. I previously managed the Shanghai Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing Government. After the establishment of the National Government, I successively presided over the Financial Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, and the Finance and Land Bureaus of the Municipal Government, and the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee of the Ministry of Finance. For employment, I have always based my decisions on the above-mentioned purpose, with the principle of economics as the standard. Personnel are commissioned to the minimum necessary extent. I select people for tasks, and I will never create tasks for people. As for the old staff of various organizations, those who work hard and are competent are all retained. This is the fact of the past ten years. As for those who make counter-propaganda and speculation about my employment, there is no value in arguing. Facts speak louder than words. However, no matter what organization I am in, if there are people who do not believe in the government's policies and do not work hard to implement them, or even deliberately obstruct the implementation of government orders for the sake of a few people or personal interests, or who have irregular and fraudulent behavior, I, representing the government, implementing policies, in order to protect social interests and respect the authority of the government, will of course break with sentiment and deal with them severely.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Railway Employees Should Participate in National Labor Service <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau yesterday issued instructions to various departments, stating that, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, national labor service is an obligation that all citizens should fulfill, and railway employees are no exception. If it is inconvenient to be called up at the same time due to the fact that their duties are closely related to train operation and their duties are heavy, the railway bureau may negotiate with the local government to determine the method of drawing up and dispatching personnel in rotation. Matters such as the date and substitute service fee should be handled in accordance with the outline of the national labor service method formulated by the provincial tax authorities of the provinces through which the railway passes. Regarding the participation of personnel working within the Zhejiang Province on this railway in the labor service organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, this bureau has already informed the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai of the 214th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, the first president of the United States. The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai will be closed for one day, and the U.S. community will also hold celebrations. The U.S. Children's School will be closed for one day, and the students will hold a banquet in the evening. The U.S. Children's Primary School held a play in the afternoon a few days ago to celebrate. Traditionally, the U.S. community would hold a Washington Ball on this day, but it was cancelled due to the national mourning period for King George. The warships of various countries anchored in the Huangpu River all flew the U.S. flag yesterday to express their admiration.</p>
<p>Last Year's Political Events in the Concession, Six Communist Organizations Cracked Down, More Than Fifty Strikes, North China Issues Affect Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's 1935 report, the internal scores, the organization of police affairs in general, and the traffic vehicles, have been briefly recorded in previous reports. Now, the political situation in the concession, labor issues, patriotic movements, and other reports are translated to those who care about current affairs.</p>
<p>According to the Police Department's report, last year the Chinese Communist Party and its affiliated organizations suffered a major blow in the Shanghai Concession. Six important Communist organizations were cracked down (and one important representative of the Red Labor Union stationed in China was captured). As a result, the Communist Party's activities in China were greatly diminished. Moreover, the Concession Police and the Chinese Party authorities adopted close cooperation. This year, a total of 115 Communist Party members were charged, including one foreigner. Among them, 69 were extradited to the Chinese authorities, one was handed over to the French Concession, 16 were sentenced to two and a half years in prison, four were sentenced to one year and three months in prison, one was sentenced to three years in prison, and the remaining 24 were released. Seized items included Communist books, printed materials, and wireless radios. Furthermore, the police of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai captured seven Koreans in the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is reported that they are suspected of being Communist Party members.</p>
<p>Strike events: 53 cases occurred this year, involving more than 21,000 workers, resulting in a loss of more than 378,000 workdays. The factories involved included 11 textile factories, 8 silk factories, 6 rubber factories, 3 car dealerships, 2 tobacco factories, and 23 other companies, including the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company. 42 people were arrested due to labor unrest, of whom 22 were sentenced to imprisonment, one was fined, and the rest were released.</p>
<p>A total of 171 factories in Shanghai were shut down due to economic depression, resulting in more than 45,843 unemployed workers. 82 factories were reopened, and 27,330 workers returned to work. Many of the remaining factories reduced working hours.</p>
<p>The concession authorities have been very vigilant in preventing anti-Japanese movements within the concession. The assassination of Wang Jingwei, the former President of the Executive Yuan, caused extreme panic in Shanghai. Residents of Zhabei migrated en masse, and incidents such as the killing of Japanese sailors on Baole'an Road in Hongkou and the attack on a Japanese store on Nanjing Road occurred at the same time, causing a great deal of anxiety. After November 17, people began to feel a little more at ease, and the residents who had moved out of Zhabei gradually returned to their former homes. Statistics show that more than 100,000 people moved before and after. When news of the Hebei autonomy came, the national sentiment in China was stirred up. Students in Peiping took the lead in launching demonstrations, and the patriotic movement surged up, spreading throughout the country. Shanghai students launched telegram appeals, parades, speeches, and distribution of leaflets in order to support the arrested students in Peiping and demand the punishment of national traitors.</p>
<p>On December 23, more than 500 students in Shanghai gathered at the North Railway Station, intending to board a train to Peiping to petition. The next day, the number of students there increased to more than 2,000, and traffic was disrupted for a total of six days. In order to prevent disturbances, the Chinese authorities had no choice but to declare martial law, which was not lifted by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, major events in the concession this year included the rent reduction movement, which began in 1934 and became more active this year. Rent reduction associations were established in various districts, and their work included registering tenants and petitioning the Chinese authorities. Furthermore, on November 4, the Ministry of Finance promulgated a new currency system law, nationalizing silver coins and stipulating that the banknotes of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications were legal tender. Furthermore, all small newspapers in the concession that had not registered with the Chinese authorities in accordance with the Chinese Publication Law have been ordered to cease publication and are not allowed to be sold on the streets.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Superintendent Lu Liankui and Others of the Public Concession's Chinese Detectives Yesterday Cracked a Kidnapping Case and Rescued the Hostage, Weng Kelong Was Awakened from a Deep Sleep, Eight Male and Female Kidnappers Were Arrested, Demanded 150,000 Yuan but Weng Ignored It <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Weng Kelong, 15 years old, from Chaozhou, is the son of Weng Jingqing, a wealthy merchant from Chaozhou. At 9:00 AM on December 12 of last year, Kelong was kidnapped by kidnappers using a Lilihua Company dispatch car while riding in his own chartered car with his sister Huiying from home to school on Liaoyang Road and Baker Road. More than two months have passed since then. Although the remains of Han Yueqing, the Lilihua Company driver, were found after the incident, the clue to the hostage was still like a stone sinking into the sea. Therefore, the entire city's police organs were almost constantly searching intensively. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Lu Liankui, the Chinese superintendent of the General Investigation Office of the Public Concession, suddenly received a secret report stating that the hostage in the case was still hidden in the Yu family's garden bungalow at No. 229 Xiangyin Road in Zhabei. Lu personally led Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and other detectives to the Public Security Sub-bureau of the Central District in charge of the area to request assistance. The sub-bureau dispatched armed policemen to accompany the detective team leader Xu Zhaoyuan and other detectives to the address secretly and quietly. Crossing the bamboo fence of the garden, they broke straight into the bungalow. They rushed in and found only one bandit guarding the hostage. They immediately captured him and seized a six-inch pistol and four bullets. According to his confession, his name was Zhang Shengshi. The hostage, Weng Kelong, was sleeping soundly on the bed. He was awakened from his dream by the detectives. He was haggard and almost in a beggar's state. Therefore, detectives were assigned to protect him. On one side, they turned to the neighboring house to arrest the accomplices. At that time, the bandits did not resist, so they were all captured. It is estimated that Dong Jialou, Dong Jiazeng, bandit woman Zhu Han, Dong Zhu, Dong Datou, Dong Er, Dong Xiaotou and others, totaling eight people, were arrested successively. They were taken back to the Central Police Station together with the hostage, pistol, bullets, etc. After learning that there were still fugitives, they immediately dispatched detectives to cooperate with the Public Security Sub-bureau to pursue them in all directions. On one side, they notified the Weng family to come and identify the hostage. When relatives met, they were extremely happy and shed tears. They were grateful to the police authorities. It was learned that after Kelong was kidnapped, the bandits once demanded 150,000 yuan, and then reduced it to 100,000 yuan, and scheduled a negotiation in Pukou, but Weng did not respond, so they did not succeed. Now the bandits' crimes are full, and they have been captured. Not only is it the good fortune of the Weng family, but the Lilihua Company driver who was innocently killed by the bandits will also have a chance to have his grievances redressed. The police station is now strictly interrogating the confessions of the various criminals and arresting the remaining accomplices so that they can be sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation on the morning of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Wang Deyu, Who Murdered Ding Fugeng, Was Strangled Yesterday, The Ministry Approved the Execution, Sent to Prison Yesterday, He Never Repented and Cursed Violently <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wang Deyu, a native of Wuxi, is 29 years old this year and has been working as a blacksmith. His father was originally surnamed Ding and went to the Wang family. Deyu worked as a partner at Ding Juxing Iron Shop, which was opened by Ding Gu, his widowed aunt, at No. 658 Xiaoshadu Road. He was fired for misconduct. Ding Gu's late husband left behind an only son, named Fugeng, who was studying at the Eight Immortals Bridge Sino-French School. There were dozens of acres of fertile land in Wuxi. Wang Deyu often asked his widowed aunt for loans, but she refused. He harbored resentment and planned to murder his cousin Fugeng in order to seize the property. At noon on October 25, 1933, Ding Fugeng, who was 15 years old at the time, was lured by Deyu in front of the school to the Xu's family cotton field in Longhua Airport, where he was killed. After the incident was reported by the local保甲保長to the court for an inquest, Ding Gu identified the body and claimed it for burial. On one side, the Municipal Public Security Bureau began to investigate the case and first arrested the suspect Zhou Ayuan. According to Zhou's confession, the murderer Wang Deyu was arrested in a small inn in Nanxiang. After being brought to Shanghai, the French Police Department believed that the starting point of the crime was in the French Concession, so it sent detectives to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to hand over Wang Deyu to the Second Special Court. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. After the trial, Wang Deyu was sentenced to death for premeditated murder and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely. Wang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court and the Supreme Court one after another. All appeals were rejected due to insufficient evidence. This case has been recorded in this newspaper many times. The case has been finalized after three trials and submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and approval. The High Court received the Ministry's order and, at about 10:00 AM yesterday, the acting Criminal Court President and Execution Judge Xiong Huihua, accompanied by the clerk, took a seat in the First Court and ordered the bailiff to go to the detention center to bring Wang Deyu to the court to verify his identity. Wang had been detained for two years and four months and was obese. The court told him that he had been sentenced to death for murder and that the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration had been received today to execute him according to law. The court asked him if he had any last words to say so that the court could notify his family on his behalf. Wang heard the order and said that he wanted to notify his brother at Mahe Xing Iron Shop at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Zhoushan Road and his father outside the South Gate of Wuxi to come and collect his body. He also said that since he was being executed by order, why was he not notified earlier? Then he cursed violently. The court then ordered Wang to be taken down and handed over the official documents, case files, and Wang's photo to the bailiff, ordering them to be sent to the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing for execution. The Chinese and French bailiffs escorted Wang to the Second Prison. In advance, the High Court notified the Shanghai District Procuratorate to send prosecutors to lead the execution bailiffs to the prison together with the warden to execute the sentence. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian as the supervisor of the execution. On one side, police chiefs Zhang Shuping and Chen Xihui and police officer Gu Hanqing were ordered to supervise the execution bailiffs Zou Zhendong, Shen Tingfang, Zhou Lianghua, and Wang Tingbin to carry ropes and other items to Caohejing Second Prison. Prosecutor Xie took his seat in the court and ordered the prisoner to be brought to the case. After briefly questioning his age and origin, he asked if he had any last words. The prisoner replied that he had no last words, but regretted that the execution was too hasty and he could not say goodbye to his family. The official ordered him to be taken down for execution. The prisoner walked and talked, saying that he liked to wander around on weekdays and knew that he was not suitable for it. He had committed this serious crime, and he knew that it was a misfortune from a previous life and now regretted it too late. He told the execution bailiffs to solve it quickly to avoid suffering more pain. After speaking, he strode to the gallows and knelt down. Police Chief Zhang blew his whistle, and the execution police slowly turned the gallows. After ten minutes, the prisoner died. The inspector Xuan Zhiming inspected the body and, as usual, exposed it overnight for viewing. The coffin will be buried on the day of execution. Since the establishment of the court in the French Concession, Yan Jinbiao was the first person to be sentenced to death for murder according to law. Wang Deyu is the second prisoner to be hanged to death.</p>

Later, Xue discovered that Mrs. Feng had a relationship with Zhai Jinshan, a Funing native who owned a rickshaw company, which ended due to disagreements. Subsequently, Zhou Gu approached Xue Zhao, suggesting he let Mrs. Feng become Zhai Jinshan's concubine, which was vehemently rejected. Suspecting foul play, Xue reported this to the local police station, who arrested Zhai Jinshan and sent him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. He was indicted for murder in the Criminal Court. Judge Shao Qinzhi presided over the case and completed the trial, with the verdict pending. Details were previously reported. It is now learned that Judge Shao announced the verdict in the Fifth Criminal Court yesterday. Zhou Gu was absent. The judge ordered the detained Zhai Jinshan to be brought to court. After briefly verifying his age and origin, the judge read the verdict. Zhai Jinshan was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for adultery with a married person and ten years for instigating murder, to be served concurrently, totaling ten years. Zhou Gu was found not guilty. Zhai Jinshan was ordered to compensate Xue Zhao with 160.50 legal tender yuan. Zhai Jinshan expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict. The judge instructed him to present his reasons and appeal according to the law. The court adjourned, and Zhai was taken back to be detained pending further notice.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Xu Xiafu and Ms. Hu: The Issue of Child Abduction and Abandonment; How Did They Meet and Was a Child Truly Born? <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xiafu (also known as Xu Laosan), a Ningbo native and owner of the Xu Yongji Canning Factory on Dalian Bay Road, learned in the winter before last that Ms. Hu, a foreman at the Shenxin No. 6 Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, was only thirty-nine years old and already widowed. He became very interested in her and asked Wang Guiying, a close friend of Ms. Hu, to act as a matchmaker, expressing his wish to live with her. It was agreed that Ms. Hu's son and daughter from her previous marriage would also live with Xu, who would be responsible for their education. If Ms. Hu bore a son in the future, he would be considered the legitimate heir; if not, her son from her previous marriage would be adopted to ensure the continuation of the family line. Ms. Hu believed him and severed ties with her previous husband's family, resigning from her foreman position. She then lived with Xu in a rented house on Zhaofeng Road in Hongkou, appearing as husband and wife. On October 5th of last year, Ms. Hu gave birth to a son. Xu's wish was fulfilled, but he secretly plotted to get rid of her and the child. He feigned business worries and told Ms. Hu that he was too busy with factory affairs to personally bring her living expenses and that she should collect them directly from the factory on Dalian Bay Road. Ms. Hu, unaware of his hidden intentions, went to the factory with the baby on December 2nd to collect the money. Xu, seeing that she was trapped, took the baby from her hands under the pretext of playing with it, rushed out, got into a car waiting at the factory entrance, and sped away. Ms. Hu was caught off guard by Xu's actions and did not know what to do but cry and wail. After being comforted, she temporarily returned to her mother's home in Gaolang Bridge in Yangshupu. She then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xu Xiafu, seeking confirmation of their cohabitation, the return of her infant child, and the payment of 23,040 yuan in living expenses. Judge Huang opened the trial yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Xu Hu, recounted how the defendant, through Wang Guiying, enticed her to cohabit and then abducted her child. She stated that the claimed living expenses were calculated at 60 yuan per month until she reached the age of sixty. The defendant, Xu Xiafu, was absent and sent a lawyer to represent him. The lawyer admitted that the plaintiff had given birth to a child and that Xu had met the plaintiff at a playground. The plaintiff requested that Wang Guiying and the two landlords of Zhaofeng Road be summoned to testify and clarify the matter. The court adjourned, scheduling a supplementary hearing for the afternoon of March 6th to summon the witnesses and investigate further.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Opposition to the French Concession's Cattle and Sheep Tax; Cattle Merchants Agree on Measures and Petition the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association to Implement Them <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong Society, since the French Concession Public Works Department announced the imposition of a transit tax on cattle and sheep, cattle and sheep traders have expressed their opposition. They had submitted a request through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the municipal government to negotiate its cancellation, but the French authorities refused. Now, twenty cattle merchants in this city, including Xiangxing Heji, have specifically decided on anti-tax measures and submitted them to the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association yesterday, requesting them to be disseminated and implemented to achieve the goal of cancellation. The original text reads: "Respectfully submitted, upon reading the Association's notice regarding the decision to oppose the three measures newly established by the French Concession Public Works Department for transit tax on cattle and sheep, and ordering compliance, we admire the Association's efforts to safeguard the interests of fellow traders and its vigorous response. However, fellow traders still fear that the three opposition measures decided by the Association are not sufficiently comprehensive. To ensure the achievement of abolishing the restrictions, we have made further opposition measures in response to the requests of cattle dealers and customers, and mutually agreed on two measures: 1. If the French Concession Public Works Department does not cancel the exorbitant tax, all fellow cattle slaughterers will be limited to slaughtering cattle only in the Public Concession and Chinese-controlled slaughterhouses. If cattle are slaughtered in a concession slaughterhouse, all cattle merchants will unanimously refuse to sell cattle to fellow traders who slaughter cattle in French Concession slaughterhouses. 2. Cattle purchased by fellow traders who slaughter cattle in the Public Concession and Chinese-controlled slaughterhouses cannot be transported through the French Concession to avoid being taxed; otherwise, all cattle merchants will unanimously cease trading. The above two thorough opposition measures have been unanimously signed and implemented by fellow traders. It is hereby submitted to the Association for review and approval, and for instructing all fellow traders to be informed and comply."</p>

The plan included details about the construction method, location selection, and funding sources.

<p>The Honor of Chinese Scientist Sa Bendong Discovers New Theories and Methods in Electricity Enthusiastically Welcomed by the Scientific Community in the United States</p>
<p>Dr. Sa Bendong, professor of physics and electricity at National Tsinghua University in Beiping, has spent the past three years devoting himself to research and discovering a new theory and method in electricity, which can be applied to solve some important problems in electricity. It can also be used to obtain the so-called "equal three-group circuit." It was published in an electrical journal in the United States last year and immediately attracted the attention of electrical engineers around the world. The United States is the most advanced country in electrical engineering. The AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers) is one of the highest authorities in the world of electricity. Last year, at its annual meeting, Dr. Sa's new theory of electricity was put forward for discussion, and it was immediately divided into two opposing factions, triggering a fierce debate, attracting great attention in the scientific world around the world. Its importance can be seen. In October last year, Dr. Sa took advantage of Tsinghua University's vacation to travel to the United States with his family and first went to Stanford University to conduct experimental research. When the American scientific community heard the news, they expressed their warm welcome. Various universities scrambled to send letters inviting him to give lectures and explain his new theory. The AIEE also specially invited Dr. Sa to publish his papers and research results in the AIEE journal (according to the rules, articles published in this journal are only accepted if they are truly valuable new inventions and theories). The AIEE also elected Dr. Sa to personally read his paper and lead the discussion of his new theory at its annual meeting this summer. At that time, there will inevitably be an even more intense debate. It is reported that Dr. Sa is currently employed as a visiting professor at Ohio State University, giving two hours of lectures on the new theory to professors at the university and nearby universities every week. This is the place where the Lin Jing love affair with a female clerk occurred. At this moment, general public opinion has shifted from that incident to this Chinese scientist who invented a new theory. Newspapers are competing to publish Dr. Sa's speeches and his spirit of academic research in Beiping under the rattling of Japanese planes, and they are also publishing photos of Dr. Sa and his wife, Ms. Huang Shushen.</p>
<p>At a time when scientific progress is advancing a thousand miles in the 20th century, our country has made few contributions to scientific theory. This new theory, which has aroused special debate in the European and American scientific communities, is truly rare. At the same time, it can be seen that its invention is of great significance and is the glory of Chinese science.</p>

Excluding the start-up costs, the central government only subsidizes 120,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan from the US Boxer Indemnity Fund. The provincial treasury is particularly tight this year, and efforts are being made to raise funds for the implementation of compulsory education. The counties have raised a total of 300,000 yuan. The Provincial Compulsory Education Committee has decided on the method of distributing subsidies to various counties.</p>
<p>The central and provincial funds will be used to subsidize the salaries of short-term elementary school teachers in various counties. The standard for subsidizing teacher salaries will be based on the standard of teacher salaries in elementary schools in various counties. The first allocation has been planned for 97 counties with compulsory education funds. The maximum subsidy is over 4,000 yuan for Qingyuan and other five counties, and the minimum subsidy is around 1,000 yuan for Tongxian and other five or six counties. The remaining counties receive subsidies ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The 97 counties that are currently being subsidized have officially started classes, and the remaining counties are also preparing to implement compulsory education.</p>

<p>Special Education Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The draft of the Special Education Implementation Plan of the Chinese Vocational Education Society is as follows: In order to cope with the extraordinary situation, the Society plans to set up "Special Education" in both school education and social education. The following plan is drafted for implementation: The implementation of this special education can be divided into two stages: The first stage is during normal times (i.e., when war has not broken out), along with the regular education curriculum (or reducing a small part of the regular education curriculum), making full use of spare time and energy to implement it as much as possible. The second stage is during emergencies (i.e., when war has broken out), and all or most of the regular education curriculum should be suspended and replaced with special education curriculum. Special education takes national salvation as the only goal. All the proposed measures are specially designed to cultivate the youth's and the public's knowledge and skills in saving the country to meet the extraordinary needs of the entire country at present. The scope of implementation of this plan is limited to this Society and its affiliated institutions. Other institutions that are willing to jointly handle it with this Society can also find ways to cooperate within the possible scope. The targets of implementation of this plan are listed as follows: All students in vocational schools. All students in vocational supplementary schools. All students in rural elementary schools and the public related to elementary schools. All students in mass schools. All children, youths and adults in rural reform areas. People who come to the vocational guidance center for guidance. People who come to the library to read books. The general public (people who come to the Society's academic lectures and the audience when the Society's staff members go out to give lectures). 6. The special education items proposed to be implemented in this plan are listed as follows: Regarding discussion and research: current affairs at home and abroad, economy at home and abroad, politics at home and abroad, military common sense, wartime supplies, and wartime production methods. Regarding explanation and practice: rescue techniques, defense techniques, military engineering, wartime relief techniques, and the manufacture and transportation of wartime materials. Regarding military training: various military action techniques (Note: This work will be undertaken by personnel sent by the government). Regarding social activities: lectures, performances, exhibitions, and guiding the organization of the public. Regarding reading and singing: special historical records, selected essays, valuable poems, and introductions to newspapers and magazines. Regarding talks and lectures: spiritual talks, regular and irregular lectures. Regarding actions: getting up early, participating in flag-raising ceremonies, physical exercise, emergency gathering exercises, and participating in national salvation savings societies. In order to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of this plan, one or two people should be selected from each of the eight targets listed in Article 5 to be responsible for the actual promotion, organization, supervision, and reporting. After the persons in charge of each item are selected, they should each formulate an implementation plan based on this plan and implement it on time. In order to enrich the content of special education and use it flexibly, a "Special Education Committee" will be formed to preside over all important matters such as design and promotion. Its main tasks are roughly as follows: Investigate effective methods similar to this special education in all aspects and provide them to implementers for reference at any time. Investigate the tragic situation of compatriots being oppressed and trampled by foreign forces and provide it to implementers as teaching materials at any time. Find ways to select valuable short essays, important reports, special issues, books, statistical tables, poems, etc., and reprint and distribute them at any time as teaching materials. Introduce valuable publications and provide guidance on reading behind the implementation. Compile and print spiritual talks and general lecture outlines for distribution and application. Compile and print practical pamphlets and distribute them to various agencies. Approve the plans prepared by various agencies. Collect reports from various agencies on a regular basis. Discuss various implementation methods. Investigate the achievements of various agencies in implementation. The Special Education Committee will be organized by five to nine people selected by this Society. One person will be selected from the committee as the convener, and meetings will be held every two weeks. Each committee member may serve as one or two of the departments within the association. 10. The implementation period of this plan is from March 1, 1936 to June 30, 1937. It will be decided separately after the expiration date.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Problems with Children's Reading Materials <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>By Shu Jie</p>
<p>What a person relies on to sustain life includes not only material rice and wheat, but also a kind of spiritual food. Some people, despite being materially well-fed and enjoying inexhaustible resources, will find their lives forever empty and painful if they lack spiritual nourishment, leading them to be unable to sustain their physical lives and even to commit suicide. This phenomenon is even more pronounced among intellectual circles. Besides sweets and toys, children need another non-material thing, which is "unlimited knowledge." Therefore, we often say: children's reading materials are the spiritual food of children.</p>
<p>However, have parents, teachers, and those responsible for ensuring children's happiness ever paid attention to the quality of this food?</p>
<p>Giving children rough and unhygienic food unknowingly damages their delicate digestive systems.</p>
<p>Watching children immerse themselves in comic strips and fantastical novels all day long causes me inexplicable pain.</p>
<p>During the so-called "Year of the Child," which advocates for children's well-being, we seem to have seen only grand opening ceremonies, and then "children's happiness" vanishes into empty space again. Children in some corners have not even secured the right to be human. Even among children living in the upper and middle classes, if we peel back the layers of their lives, aren't they still appendages of their parents, guardians, and teachers, even appendages of society? Even in terms of children's reading materials, has there been any better achievement in this unprecedented "Year of the Child" compared to non-"Year of the Child" times? Children are still immersed in comic strips, their minds are still filled with the toxins of fantastical novels, and children are forever swallowing rough food—spiritual food!</p>
<p>The "Year of the Child" is coming to an end, and the National Children's Reading Materials Exhibition has surprisingly appeared in the New Year market. This cannot but be considered somewhat satisfactory! The exhibition collects children's reading materials from all over the country throughout history, as well as elementary school textbooks published by various bookstores, and pays attention to the display of unhealthy reading materials, allowing visitors to gain a general impression of the current state of children's reading materials in our country, and from then on strive for the future, leaving a glimmer of hope for the children of the future. Its significance is indeed very high.</p>
<p>However, I personally still have several things that I must express:</p>
<p>First, I remember a time when everyone felt that the stories of "Sister Cat" and "Brother Cow," etc., were boring, advocating for a different way to write stories. I also remember that some people, seeing that today is a scientific world, believed that children should gain more scientific knowledge. Therefore, later, reading materials such as "Scientific Little Tricks" sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, how the writing technique of this different method is, has never been fairly evaluated. The principle of imparting scientific knowledge is certainly correct, but the kind of scientific little tricks that have already been published do not seem to make children as enthusiastic about studying them as they are about fantastical novels. It seems that too few people pay attention to the "interest issue" of reading and the "sugar-coating issue" of reading materials.</p>
<p>Second, the need for universal distribution of children's reading materials is like the need for universal access to food, both being matters of course. However, looking at the reality, we cannot help but feel very pessimistic about the future. On the one hand, student parents are becoming increasingly impoverished, making extracurricular reading a "luxury" for students. On the other hand, the prices of children's reading materials are still too high, reducing the reading opportunities for children in middle-class families. Regarding the excessively high profits of children's reading materials, people in the book industry say that several bookstores have indeed started their fortunes because of this. Originally, with China's large population and only a few bookstores operating children's reading materials, if universal education were to be effective, the prosperity of their business could be predicted. If they could reduce profits and allow children to enjoy them universally, their income would still be the same.</p>
<p>Third, the business of operating children's reading materials is too commercialized. Everyone rushes towards where there is profit, and everyone imitates it, but those who can blaze new trails and provide children with another direction of benefit are extremely rare. The fact is very obvious: at a certain period, booksellers saw that the sales of books for college and middle school students were gradually narrowing, and they did not know how to turn their attention to young children. Thus, there was this "Little Friends" series from one company, that "Elementary School Students" series from another, and yet another "New Children" series. Comparing the content, they were still all the same, and there were even many cases of "later arrivals falling behind." For the sake of children, I hope that booksellers will clear their heads from now on and stop copying other people's articles. Even for the sake of booksellers' own capital, there is a great need to rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff!</p>
<h3 id="e171">Investigation of the Porcelain Industry in Jiujiang <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>By Jia Yu</p>
<p>Jiujiang is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and is the throat for the entry and exit of passengers and goods in Jiangxi Province. The prosperity of the market is quite comparable to that of Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province. Before 1926, the total population of the county was about 120,000, most of whom were coolies from various counties and neighboring provinces. Exported goods include cotton, hemp, ramie cloth, rice, sesame, beans, porcelain, etc., and the amount of trade surplus was no less than tens of millions of yuan every year. Later, with the rise of the revolutionary army, Jiangxi was in a primary military position, and the output of the above-mentioned goods declined slightly compared to previous years. As of now, except for a small amount of porcelain, other items such as rice and cotton even rely on supplies from other provinces, turning from a trade surplus to a trade deficit.</p>
<p>As for porcelain, because it is a unique product of Jiangxi Province, it can still maintain its export position, but compared to the export situation in 1926, it is naturally far different. Even comparing the two years of 1934 and 1935, it has been declining year by year. We only need to look at the table below to know to what extent the porcelain industry in Jiangxi has declined!</p>
<p>Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, can be said to be a world-famous porcelain production area, but because its transportation is underdeveloped, in terms of exports, except for occasional one or two times when large folk boats like "Meng Chong warships" are directly transported to Shanghai, it almost entirely relies on Jiujiang as its gateway for intake and expulsion. Therefore, merchants traveling to and from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River generally only know that Jiujiang's porcelain is cheap and of good quality, but they do not know that the porcelain-producing area is Jingdezhen, which is more than a hundred miles away from Jiujiang. Jiujiang occupies a geographically advantageous position, so the number of stores operating porcelain is no less than the number of "kiln households" in Jingdezhen. In 1926, there were more than 40 porcelain stores in Jiujiang, all engaged in export trade; there were also more than 200 "porcelain peddlers" who rushed to catch boats. It is said that at that time, the number of porcelain sales at home and abroad was more than five times higher than last year's sales. Generally, porcelain merchants and "porcelain peddlers" had profits ranging from several hundred to tens of thousands of yuan every year. However, "good times don't last forever." Since the wave of depression swept in in 1928, various businesses have gradually declined. This unique porcelain industry in Jiangxi naturally cannot stand alone. Therefore, porcelain stores and "porcelain peddlers" that used to be very profitable have closed down and suspended operations one after another. Recently, only about half of the original number can still maintain their current situation.</p>
<p>Almost all of Jiujiang's porcelain stores are capitalized by local Jiujiang people. Only two stores, such as Jiangxi Porcelain Industry Company, are operated by Nanchang people. Most of the "porcelain peddlers" are from "Duchang," and Jiujiang people only account for 10% of them, so their competitive power on boats is ultimately not as great as the "Duchang gang." Most of the porcelain stores with strong capital have "estate agents" stationed in Jingdezhen to purchase the required goods at any time. And the type of goods required is mostly reserved in whole batches. In this way, not only is it cheaper, but the style of a certain type of goods can also be "exclusively booked" (meaning that a certain type of goods cannot be sold to others at the same time). In terms of paying for goods, because they have large capital and purchase a lot of goods, generally "kiln households" are willing to provide credit to customers for the sake of business competition. If they can pay 400 yuan for goods worth 1,000 yuan, they are already considered very good customers in the eyes of "kiln households." However, small-capital porcelain stores do not have so many advantages, and because they have weak capital, they do not dare to order goods from Jingdezhen and have to resell them from large porcelain stores in the local area. In this reselling process, the price is 10% to 20% higher than that in Jingdezhen (the abbreviation for Jingdezhen on "the town"). Large porcelain stores focus more on export trade and wholesale, while small porcelain stores focus on retail, especially valuing foreign merchants. Therefore, all stores have temporary brokers who are sent to solicit business when Yangtze River steamers, foreign warships, or the Nanxun train arrive in Jiujiang.</p>
<p>The target of "porcelain peddlers" is mostly the passing steamers. It can be said that there is no guarantee of how good or bad the business will be each day. Once a steamer arrives in Jiujiang, these one or two hundred "porcelain peddlers" will all carry baskets for holding porcelain and rush onto the ship, take a good spot, and spread a piece of coarse cloth a few feet square on the deck. This spot will become their designated business venue, and other peers cannot snatch it. Then, they will display the goods in the basket one by one, and then squat down to wait for customers. If you don't understand their tricks when buying porcelain here, you may sometimes spend five or six times the price and still not buy the same genuine goods as those on the shore (i.e., porcelain stores), because the porcelain in the hands of "porcelain peddlers" does not have a fixed price. They quote the price according to the customer's attitude. Things that should cost one or two yuan may sometimes only cost two or three jiao to get. This sales strategy of "porcelain peddlers" is full of deception as a means. If the deception is successful, they can earn a little more profit. Therefore, their daily income is quite difficult to be certain. Sometimes it is ten or twenty yuan, and sometimes it is ten or twenty yuan, which they do not consider to be anything rare.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Medical Apprenticeship Life <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>By Mao Fengtu</p>
<p>When I was twelve years old, my father sent me to the city to study medicine. Among the hundred professions, besides studying and becoming an official, studying medicine would be the next best thing. Our area greatly respected doctors, especially "Confucian doctors." The so-called "Confucian doctors" are internal medicine doctors. This, of course, refers to traditional Chinese medicine. In our remote county town, there was no Western medicine ten years ago. Even if there was, people would not believe that it could cure diseases. When "Confucian doctors" go out to treat diseases, they only carry a long tobacco pouch (dry tobacco), unlike "herbal medicine doctors" (surgeons) who have to carry a large satchel (medicine bag), because they only diagnose pulses and prescribe prescriptions, and do not sell or dispense medicine. Moreover, when going out, if the doctor is very famous nearby, the patient's family always picks them up in a sedan chair. And my teacher (master) was a very famous doctor in that area.</p>
<p>Studying medicine is always the profession of children from scholarly families. Because at the very least, they must have read the "Four Books" and be able to write articles in order to recognize the profound words in "Treatise on Cold Damage" and "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," and to be able to write medical records and explain pathology. After the apprentice "completes his apprenticeship," the treatment he enjoys and the rewards he receives are more generous than other professions. Therefore, after I finished reading the "Four Books," "Classic of Poetry," and "Zuo Zhuan," and could write the article "To learn and practice constantly," I began my "apprenticeship."</p>
<p>My father led me, carrying a basket of gifts, paper candles, and firecrackers, to my master's residence. This was after much discussion beforehand. Because my master was famous, many people went to him to become apprentices. He did not need so many apprentices and did not have the time and energy to educate and take care of them. After my father repeatedly begged and asked others to intercede, he was allowed to try temporarily. As soon as I entered my master's door, I saw a fat, fifty-year-old man with a face full of messy beards, a pair of frightening eyes, and thick black flesh. I immediately felt terrified. After lighting candles and firecrackers to "kowtow" to the master, my father said, "Please be patient and teach... be strict..." Then, my master spoke like thunder: "I don't treat apprentices like others. First and foremost, I am strict... 'Good people come from under the yellow rattan stick'... 'Jade must be carved to become a vessel'..."</p>
<p>In my master's house, besides a mistress, there were four apprentices besides me, who were my elder brothers. Some were in their twenties, and some were seventeen or eighteen, all older than me. The rule for apprentices is "the older ones go out, the younger ones suffer." Later junior brothers always have to "roughhew," and all the rough and miscellaneous tasks should be done by the "newcomer." After my father left me, I felt like a child who had lost his family. As usual, the elder brothers came to assign work. In the morning, I had to sweep the floors upstairs and downstairs first, and wipe the tables, chairs, and benches clean. Afterwards, I had to go to the street to buy vegetables and go to the well to fetch water. Then, I had to cook and wash dishes. This went on until late at night. With junior brothers, the elder brothers, besides following the master to "see patients" in batches, would just sit at their desks reading medical books, and would not help the junior brothers with anything. Because every elder brother had gone through this stage, and the master and mistress would never let them help out. Perhaps this was the process of carving jade. Not to mention the housework, if patients came to the house to see a doctor, the elder brothers, according to the master's orders, could also go out to take pulses or write prescriptions, which the master would correct. But I only dared to go to the living room once to serve tea and cigarettes. The rest of the time, I still hid in the kitchen doing chores.</p>
<p>I had been studying for a month, and my master had not officially taught me any medical books yet. Although I had brought several books such as "Tangtou Gejue" and "Maijue Guizheng," which were beginner's guides, from home, I had no time to read them, and my master had never asked me to read them. I thought to myself: I am here to learn a profession, to seek knowledge, not to work for the master's family. If this continues, what will happen when I "complete my apprenticeship" in five years! In the dark night, when washing clothes alone, on the way to buy vegetables in the wind and rain, I thought of my father, mother, and lively and lovely siblings at home, how happy they were!</p>
<p>My only hope was that my father would come to take me back, or that the master would have another "newcomer" apprentice. But a month, two months, a year passed, and I was still constantly working. I had not even finished reading a "Maijue Guizheng."</p>
<p>In the second year, the eldest and second elder brothers successively "completed their apprenticeships." When "completing the apprenticeship," they had to "thank the master," which meant giving money and gifts. The money for "thanking the master" was specified in the "apprenticeship agreement," at least one hundred strings (equivalent to one hundred yuan at the time), to be paid off in five years. When "completing the apprenticeship," they also had to give the master and mistress gift hats, gift clothes, and gift shoes. During the apprenticeship, besides giving "master's money," other expenses such as food and lodging and miscellaneous expenses had to be paid to the master every month, and he could also extract some profit from this. In the fourth year of the apprenticeship, when they were about to complete their apprenticeship, they could follow the master's orders to see patients at their homes alone, but all the "pulse-reading money" they earned still had to be given to the master. When the master was too busy, even apprentices who had only been studying for three years could go to see patients and earn money for him. A slightly famous doctor usually had four or five apprentices. The two older ones could go out to earn money for him separately, the two middle ones could follow him out separately, and the last one would specialize in doing chores for him. At most, he would recruit one or two newcomers every other year. In this way, he would continue to have people to use, people to earn money, and be able to obtain surplus value. In the second year, a junior brother came to replace me in doing the miscellaneous chores, but the master still did not formally teach me to read. I only learned from the elder brothers, or asked them if there were things I didn't understand. But the master couldn't explain anything at all, and only said "See more cases and you'll get it right." Taking pulses was also just vague guesswork. Perhaps this is a "floating" pulse, ah, maybe it's a "sunken" pulse. After taking the pulse, I didn't know how to write a prescription. The master always said with his pipe in his mouth, "Guizhi Gancao Tang... add Baizhu, Dangshen... two qian... three qian..." He didn't explain why he used such medicine. You could only memorize more "tangtou" and more "symptoms," and try and experiment yourself, and rely on luck. As for what kind of disease it was, you would never have a certain method of recognition, nor a certain method of using medicine. The patient's life or death also depended on their luck. In this way, you continued to read some "Shanghan Qianzhu," "Bingli Jue Wei," and Zhang Zhongjing's "Sixteen Types." You also followed the master to take pulses and write prescriptions many times. You seemed to understand medicine, and then you were not far from "completing your apprenticeship." It must be said that although the master didn't teach you anything, after you "completed your apprenticeship," you still had the obligation to send gifts during the New Year or the master and mistress's birthdays.</p>
<p>The five years of apprenticeship were finally over, and my age was not far from twenty. I thought I could make a living and earn money from now on. But young doctors were said to have no experience, and there seemed to be very many colleagues, but there were very few patients. Perhaps it was because there were too many people seeking this profession and too many people who could not afford medical treatment. This forced me to be idle for several years, and I had to change careers. But I will never forget these five years of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Old Moses, a black man who sold eggs and chicks, was honest and reliable, but he had a bad habit of chattering endlessly with his customers, so he often got the number of eggs they wanted to buy wrong. Every day, he drove a small donkey cart full of goods to the street to do business. Once, he parked his cart in front of an old lady's house because the lady came out of the house to buy some things from him.</p>
<p>"Uncle, do you have eggs today?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, I just brought ten dozen eggs from the countryside."</p>
<p>"Are they fresh?"</p>
<p>"I guarantee you'll be satisfied. These are all very fresh."</p>
<p>"Then, give me nine dozen. Count the eggs into this basket."</p>
<p>"Very well, madam." He counted the eggs: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. —You can trust me, these are all very fresh. What grade is your young master in school? He must be very tall and big now."</p>
<p>"Yes, uncle, he is a clerk in a bank in Galveston."</p>
<p>"Oh, how old is he this year?"</p>
<p>"Eighteen years old."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's really capable! An eighteen-year-old can already earn money! Eighteen, (counting eggs), nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five. —Is your young lady also doing well lately? When I last saw her, she was almost as tall as an adult."</p>
<p>"She has already married and lives in Dallas."</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious, time really flies! You say she already has children? I wonder how old she is this year? I think she should be..."</p>
<p>"Thirty-three years old."</p>
<p>"Really? Thirty-three, (counting eggs), thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three. —It's strange, your young master and lady are also so old. You say you also have grandchildren, and I can't believe it even more. You look like you're only forty-three years old."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I know you're deliberately fooling me. When a person reaches fifty-three years old..."</p>
<p>"Fifty-three? I don't believe it. Fifty-three, (counting eggs), fifty-four, fifty-five, fifty-six... Please be careful, we don't want to miscount the eggs. —Fifty-seven, (counting eggs), fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-four. —Gah, the weather is so hot today! Now I really feel like I'm old! I won't live much longer! But everyone in your family is blessed with long life. It is said that your grandfather died at the ripe old age of seventy!..."</p>
<p>"No, it was seventy-two."</p>
<p>"Indeed, that's very old. —Seventy-two, (counting eggs), seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine. —And what about your grandmother? She is one of the noblest ladies I have ever met, and you often talk to me about her. As for her, she lived even longer, almost to a hundred years old. I believe she was over a hundred years old when she passed away."</p>
<p>"No, uncle, she was only ninety-six years old when she passed away."</p>
<p>"That's not young either. —Ninety-six, (counting eggs), ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred and one, one hundred and two, one hundred and three, one hundred and four, one hundred and five, one hundred and six, one hundred and seven, one hundred and eight. —There are a total of one hundred and eight eggs here, which is exactly nine dozen.

<p>They are all very good, very fresh. Here, I'll add one more, because I might have miscounted."</p>
<p>Old Moses made a good deal and left happily. A few days later, the lady said to her husband:</p>
<p>"Old maid Matilda, I'm afraid I'll have to fire her. She steals! I know exactly how many eggs there are. I just bought these eggs the day before yesterday, but only two days have passed, and half of them are already gone. I remember I was standing at the door, watching old Moses count one by one. He couldn't have been wrong about nine dozen eggs."</p>
<h3 id="e174">Short Essay: The Emergence of Culture <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>By Fang</p>
<p>Regarding the forms of cultural emergence, there are two opposing theories: the first is called the Theory of Diffusion, and the other is called the Theory of Independent Development. The theory of diffusion means that a nation does not have its own culture, and its cultural emergence all comes from the diffusion from other nations. The theory of independent development is the opposite. Nations themselves can develop culture, and the similar cultures of various nations are not the result of mutual influence and adoption, but the result of independent development in similar environments. These two theories should be in a relative position, competing for strengths and weaknesses, but in our view, they are mutually complementary and do not conflict.</p>
<p>The theory of diffusion is also known as the Theory of Borrowing, and its opinion is more clearly expressed in the word "borrowing." Those who advocate this theory include Smith of England. After a nation develops culture, such as writing, language, customs, beliefs, and material civilization, it can be borrowed by another nation. As a result, various nations borrow from each other, and many cultures have extremely similar characteristics because they all come from the diffusion and borrowing from a single source. For example, because Greek Orthodox Christianity was spread to Russia, Russian and Greek have many words that are similar in form and pronunciation. Chinese and Japanese are even more obvious. The same is true of language. During the Middle Ages, the Arabs expanded their power to Spain, and European languages adopted a large number of Arabic words, such as Admiral, Arsenal, and Zero. China did not have the custom of kissing, but after the sea ban was lifted, it often appeared in movies. Egyptian bathhouses were adopted by the Romans as luxurious bathhouses in their palaces. Indian Buddhism has spread to Siam and other places and is equally respected. The German waltz is very popular with Americans. There are really many such examples, which shows that the culture of a nation is mostly borrowed from other nations. The reason why there are similar cultures in the world is the result of diffusion.</p>
<p>We agree with the theory of diffusion, and this phenomenon does exist in culture. However, after further investigation, we know that the theory of diffusion has a defect that is difficult to conceal. We only need to ask this question: Egypt is assumed by diffusionists to be the first diffuser of culture, but how did the culture of Egypt emerge? There were no earlier diffusers before Egypt, so its culture must have been bestowed by the sun god Osiris (the greatest god of Egypt); or, it can be said that Egypt is a natural cultural diffuser. This explanation is obviously very poor. In this way, how culture emerges, this question is still not resolved. The fact is very clear: the theory of diffusion can only explain the phenomenon after culture exists, and its explanation of the emergence of culture itself is very inadequate; because the culture of the earliest ancient cultural nations cannot be said to have been borrowed. The conditions for the emergence of culture itself, or rather, how Egyptian culture can emerge, this topic can only be undertaken by the theory of independent development.</p>
<p>The theory of independent development means that culture has independent development. It can also be called the Theory of Independent Origin: because culture is not affected by assimilation from others and does not come into contact with others, it can also be called Parallelism. This is a matter of course: the culture of the world's earliest cultural nations arose by themselves. The only question is why there are mutual similarities between the cultures of various nations? According to the opinion of the theory of diffusion, it is mutual contact; according to the theory of independent development, in similar environments, similar cultures will be produced, without the need for transmission, and independent development is also possible. The theory of independent development attaches great importance to the environment.</p>
<p>The following three environments can enable culture to develop independently and can also make the emergence of culture similar:</p>
<p>1.  Human beings have the same general psychological tendencies.</p>
<p>2.  Human beings have the same basic needs.</p>
<p>3.  Human beings have the same objective environment to rely on for living.</p>
<p>These three opinions were put forward by Hankins, only the order and wording have been changed. Hankins's order and wording are as follows: 1. Natural needs, 2. The system of matter and environment, 3. The identity of human psychology. The reason why we put human psychology first is because it is closer to culture, while the latter two seem to tend towards civilization.</p>
<p>Human psychology is not only the same in terms of senses or perception, but also in terms of thought. However, thought here is broad, including all organized reasoning and associations. There are many examples that can be cited, but only a few can be mentioned here. For example, the emergence of religion is due to the fear and awe of human psychology caused by celestial phenomena. Gods often reside in the heavens or even represent the heavens and heavenly objects, such as the sun, moon, and stars. The custom of kneeling is due to psychological impulses such as extreme piety, respect, and joy. Piety is religious, respect is for elders, and joy is expressed in courtship and the kissing of children. Art is due to the human psychology of loving beauty. For example, the custom of tattooing is that although primitive people do not know the beauty of clothes, they still want to paint and tattoo their naked bodies; singing is the beauty of tone, dancing is the beauty of movement, and sculpture is the beauty of stillness. Although there are elements of survival mixed in these, psychological elements also account for the majority: in times of reverence, everyone in the world knows to kneel down.</p>
<p>The second and third points do not need to be elaborated on. The whole world knows that clothes can keep out the cold, food is sent to the mouth when eating, and there are houses and vehicles everywhere. The objective environment is also very important. Rivers can produce culture, deserts can produce religion, grasslands can produce animal husbandry, tropical climates can produce early marriage, cold climates can produce depression, and islands can produce the habit of adventurous seafaring.</p>
<p>Although culture has contagious diseases, a nation still has its independent elements, which we call cultural patterns. Cultural patterns are also noticed by independent development theorists. The factors that create cultural patterns are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Geographical relations: Eskimos wear leather clothes, Africans do not, this is the relationship between cold and warmth. People in the desert do not eat fish, people along the coast are good at eating fish, this is the relationship of rivers.</p>
<p>2.  Historical relations: Europeans are all influenced by the Roman Empire, the Chinese are not, and the two cultures are different.</p>
<p>3.  Racial relations: White people transplanted to the Americas have produced a high culture, while the Indians in the same area are still primitive. This is the relationship between different races.</p>
<p>The theory of independent development can explain the emergence of culture, and the theory of diffusion can explain the changes in culture—in cultural changes, the contact of other ethnic cultures is very powerful—only by combining these two can the question of how culture is generated be resolved.</p>

<p>By Yi</p>
<p>After the anti-bandit military deployment, the atmosphere eased somewhat. The gossipy women opened their chatterboxes again:</p>
<p>"The Zhang family village was robbed the night before last! It is said that they also killed a night watchman! Even the old lady's funeral clothes were stolen!"</p>
<p>"Yes! The world is really going to hell: the night before last, wasn't the Li family, a wealthy household in our village, also robbed? —Actually, calling it stealing is equal to robbery: eight or nine people came, all armed with weapons, but they didn't kill anyone. Hmm, it's very strange! The faces of those robbers were all smeared with soot. I heard that one of them looked a lot like Old Wang, the pig butcher!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? If no one local leads the way, how would others be so familiar? There are several bad guys in our ditch who are doing this business!"</p>
<p>"……………………………………"</p>
<p>In this way, you reported a piece of news, and I reported another: somewhere a fat pig was slaughtered, and somewhere else a young boy was abducted. One person said it, and two people chimed in, saying it so vividly as if it were the facts happening right before their eyes!</p>
<p>Although these news were inevitably a bit exaggerated, the situation in my hometown was indeed very different from before. Just take our village as an example. There had never been any robberies, and even theft was rare. The atmosphere was always peaceful, and people lived and worked in peace. But after I returned home this time, I could no longer absorb that "peaceful" atmosphere, and I could no longer see that "peaceful and prosperous" scene. In just ten days, I heard four or five bandit alarms and encountered two incidents of soldiers harassing people for grain!</p>
<p>"The world and people's hearts" have really changed!</p>
<p>The winter days passed especially quickly, and it was dark in the midst of a flurry of activity. At this time, the family's attention focused on the brother's wedding again. After getting through tonight, tomorrow will be the official wedding day, but the arrangements for the wedding and all the expenses have not yet been settled. The family was longing for the return of the second brother, but he had not returned or sent anyone to bring a message. How was he preparing? Everything should be going smoothly. Everyone was anxiously waiting and had the same thought: There should be a way!</p>
<p>When the family was waiting anxiously, the second brother actually came back, followed by several baskets full of things, the big ones being meat, wine... in short, perhaps everything necessary for tomorrow had been prepared. At this time, the people in the family were somewhat lighter, and a little liveliness appeared on their faces!</p>
<p>The second brother greeted the guests and exchanged pleasantries for a while before silently walking into Dad's room. Mom, the second sister-in-law, and I followed him, as if he had absorbed our souls! He wiped off the winter sweat and then said with a sigh:</p>
<p>"Why are there so many guests!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Taking advantage of the liveliness. Anyone who is even remotely related has run over!" Mom said angrily.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Public Concession Work Bureau: Abridged Budget for the Year <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Works Department: The Works Committee of the Public Concession Work Bureau convened a meeting on the 11th of this month to discuss the 1936 budget for the Works Department. The results of the discussion were generally as follows:</p>
<p>No expenditures are planned for bridge and embankment work this year. 70,000 yuan will be allocated for the expansion of sewers, work that began last year, with the eastern district deemed a pressing need. 141,000 yuan is urgently needed for new pipe work under the sewage ditch item, as is 77,500 yuan for disposal plant work. Regarding the Work Bureau's real estate, five fen of land needs to be added to the Jiaozhou Park to complete the original plan, requiring a land price of 12,000 yuan. Seven and a half mu of land need to be added to Poyang Road Park, requiring a land price of 105,000 yuan. The construction of several public toilets requires a price of 15,000 yuan, with an additional 20,000 yuan needed to pay for the remaining land price when purchasing land. A total of 133,000 yuan is deemed urgently needed for the above real estate additions. Regarding housing, a wharf building must be constructed this year, with an estimated construction cost of approximately 360,000 yuan. Originally, it was intended to pay 200,000 yuan this year, but due to financial constraints, 100,000 yuan will be paid first. The construction cost of public toilets is 15,000 yuan, and a food pavilion in the Bund Park costs 12,000 yuan. All of the above are temporary expenditures. In terms of regular expenditures, the Works Department's budget was discussed with the Director of Finance, and it was decided to reduce various items, resulting in a decrease of 484,100 yuan compared to last year's budget. Internal expenses of the Works Department have also been reduced as much as possible. According to the Director of the Works Department, the number of residents in the concession has now increased by 150,000, and the various public services required will naturally increase. However, the number of foreign staff within the department will be reduced by as many as 18 by July of this year, saving 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in salaries. In fact, the actual savings may be even greater. Furthermore, the Chief Sanitary Inspector's budget of 66,330 yuan for this year has also been included. All of the above works budgets have been approved by the Works Committee and submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<p>Fire Department: The Fire Department of the Work Bureau has had its 1936 budget drafted by the department head and submitted to the Finance Committee for review. An outline of the main points is given below. In terms of temporary expenditures, most construction projects have had to be temporarily suspended due to financial constraints. Those that are deemed necessary and cannot be delayed any longer include widening the bottom layer of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, requiring an expense of 1,700 yuan. Furthermore, the construction debt for the Huishan Fire Station branch, amounting to 500 yuan, should be paid off this year. In terms of regular expenditures, it has been necessary to vigorously reduce government spending due to economic conditions. The vacancies of five people, including the station chief and deputy station chief, this year will not be filled by others. The hiring of a secretary for the department, which had been previously approved, has now also been decided to be temporarily abandoned. Regarding Chinese staff, the originally planned additional hiring of 19 firefighters, one artisan worker, and one driver have all been abandoned. Therefore, the original budget, excluding the ambulance team and stored items, totaling over 1,210,000 yuan, has now been reduced to 1,148,540 yuan, a decrease of nearly 30,000 yuan compared to last year. In addition, leather belts have already been ordered but cannot be used immediately, so the original budget of 27,000 yuan has also been reduced to 20,000 yuan. The ambulance team originally planned to hire two additional drivers, but this has now been decided to be abandoned. Therefore, after other reductions in the team's budget, it has been reduced by 1,160 yuan compared to 1935. Regarding stored items, the original budget of 263,420 yuan has been reduced to 62,130 yuan, of which over 38,000 yuan is of a permanent nature and has been reclassified under temporary expenditures. The item that has been reduced is the Fire Chief's original plan to purchase four ambulances, but due to financial constraints, only two can be purchased for now.</p>
<p>Police Department: The Public Concession Police Department's 1936 budget has been submitted to the Police Committee for review. Among the temporary expenditures, apart from all construction and additions that had to be temporarily suspended due to financial constraints, the following items have been included in the budget: The Jiaxing Road Police Station needs to add over two fen of vacant land, requiring a price of 15,500 yuan. The central police station has a remaining payment of 48,000 yuan due this year. The Dulu Police Station's Chinese staff dormitory has a remaining payment of 1,400 yuan due this year. The construction of a stable on Andong Road requires 7,500 yuan for labor and materials. The remaining payment for the men's and women's sections of the Fourth Prison totals 51,000 yuan. The Chinese prison requires 7,000 yuan. The Chengdu Road police dormitory owes 133,000 yuan due this year. The installation of hot water pipes at the Gordon Road police station costs 3,000 yuan. The Fair Road rickshaw station costs 2,000 yuan. The above are all temporary expenditures. Regarding regular expenditures, the Police Department's initial budget, after review by the directors of the Police and Finance Departments, was set at 9,876,950 yuan, a decrease of 300,297 yuan compared to the previous year, or a reduction of slightly less than 3%. Among them, ordinary police expenses total over 8,550,000 yuan, and prisons and reformatories total over 1,320,000 yuan. The source of this reduction is the temporary reduction in police personnel and the austerity measures implemented by the Director of the Police Department. Regarding the former, such as the fact that one assistant inspector has recently retired and will not be replaced for the time being, one inspector has been reduced, 30 patrolmen and probationary patrolmen have been reduced, 63 Indian constables have been reduced, and 58 Chinese constables have been reduced. In the prison, a total of over 20 people have been reduced. In addition, the original budget for fuel this year was 253,000 yuan, which was subsequently reduced to 220,000 yuan, which is 20,000 yuan less than last year. According to the opinion of the Director of Finance, all of the above items have been reduced to the minimum, and the Director of the Police Department has made a sincere effort to assist in the reduction of government spending.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps: Regarding the budget for the Public Concession Volunteer Corps this year, the only temporary expenditure is the construction of a motor vehicle garage at the rifle range, requiring 3,000 yuan for labor and materials. This is for the Russian Volunteer Corps to park armored vehicles, and can accommodate six vehicles, housing two rows of soldiers. Since the team is a strong force for protecting the concession, every effort should be made to ensure rapid transportation of troops in the event of an incident. Therefore, the expense is indispensable. Regarding regular expenditures, after review by the commander of the Volunteer Corps and the Director of Finance, the proposed amount is 306,050 yuan, a decrease of over 80,000 yuan compared to last year, or one-fifth. This savings comes from strict austerity measures in uniforms, repairs to weapons, equipment, and travel expenses. Regarding the former, there are still exchange clothes that can be used, so over 70,000 yuan has been saved. In addition, the Russian Volunteer Corps requires a budget of 383,780 yuan this year, a decrease of over 21,000 yuan compared to last year. For further government spending reduction, the Director of Finance originally suggested no longer recruiting new soldiers and reducing the current number to 250. However, after consultation by the Police Committee, it was unanimously agreed that the strength of the Russian team is extremely important to the security of the concession, so it was decided to maintain the original high amount without reducing it.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Academic Circles Launch a Collection of Works Commemorating the Birthday of Cai Yuanpei and Liu Yazi <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Liu Yazi are esteemed elders in domestic academic circles, with their morality and writings widely respected by all parties. This year marks Mr. Cai's 70th birthday and Mr. Liu's 50th birthday. Prominent figures in this city, in order to celebrate the birthdays of the two gentlemen, have initiated a collection of writings and paintings from figures in academic circles to compile a commemorative collection of Cai Yuanpei and Liu Yazi's birthdays. A committee for collecting commemorative works has been established to be responsible for the project, and it is reported that the commemorative collection will be presented to Mr. Cai and Mr. Liu around the Double Tenth Festival of this year. The purpose and regulations for collecting works have now been found and are reproduced below.</p>
<p>Purpose: This year, the South Society Memorial Hall was established. It so happens that our Honorary President, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, is 70 years old, and our President, Mr. Liu Yazi, is 50 years old. The morality and writings of Mr. Cai and Mr. Liu are admired by us, and the birthdays of the two gentlemen are worth celebrating. Mr. Cai and Mr. Liu are esteemed elders in academic circles, and we are mostly engaged in literary and artistic work. As the saying goes, "A scholar's gift is half a sheet of paper." When we celebrate the birthdays of Mr. Cai and Mr. Liu, we don't need birthday cakes or birthday banners, but rather birthday essays and birthday poems. We plan to collect articles from famous figures in academic circles, each according to their strengths, to write an essay or select a representative work from their life and compile a commemorative collection of Cai Yuanpei and Liu Yazi's birthdays to be presented to the two gentlemen on the day of the Double Tenth Festival, taking Mr. Cai and Mr. Liu as role models and being inspired to present a commemorative collection to the two gentlemen. We think the two gentlemen will surely be happy. We have now organized a committee to handle the collection of such "scholar's gifts," and the regulations for collecting works will be set separately. The address for correspondence is: Mr. Wu Jingshan, No. 291 Sapo Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regulations: Regulations for the Collection of Works Commemorating the Birthday of Cai Yuanpei and Liu Yazi. Commemorative works for Mr. Cai Yuanpei's 70th birthday and Mr. Liu Yazi's 50th birthday are divided into three categories: (A) Essays: Essays in various subjects such as thesis, science, literature, history, geography, and society are acceptable, limited to one piece and 5,000 words. (B) Poetry: Select representative works from a lifetime, limited to one poem. (C) Paintings: Select representative works from a lifetime, both traditional Chinese paintings and Western paintings are acceptable, limited to one piece. Participants may choose one of the above three categories, with each category limited to one piece. The deadline for collecting commemorative works is June 30th of this year. Commemorative works should be sent to Mr. Wu Jingshan, No. 291 Sapo Road, Shanghai. In addition to compiling the commemorative collection, the commemorative works will be entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Tongzhi Museum or the Shanghai Municipal Museum for preservation and exhibition at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Zhang Chongren's Solo Exhibition Closed Yesterday: The Exhibition at the French Association on Huanlong Road for Nine Days Was Widely Visited <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Chongren's solo exhibition closed at 2 PM yesterday. Despite the fluctuating wind and rain, the number of visitors was exceptionally high. Within an hour of the opening, the number had reached over a hundred, mostly from the art world, showing that domestic people are paying increasing attention to art. The various aspects of the exhibition are described below.</p>
<p>Famous Paintings at High Prices: The exhibition features many carefully crafted masterpieces, including oil paintings, watercolors, charcoal drawings, and sculptures. Among the oil paintings, there is a view of the interior of a church, entitled "Light of the Temple," with a solemn color tone that inspires a sense of solemnity. It is said that the oil painting was once offered a price of 8,000 French francs (equivalent to 2,000 yuan of national currency) in Belgium, but Mr. Zhang was unwilling to sell it. Another painting is a landscape, "Cool Wind Waves," with lush green and secluded scenery, and the coolness jumps out of the picture. It once participated in a competition and won first place.</p>
<p>Lifelike Sculptures: Sculpture is the most difficult art form. All subjects, such as human anatomy, require a great deal of research. Among the exhibits this time, there are many sculptures, all of which are lifelike in expression. The No. 1 bust in particular is a successful work, and those who view it around it praise it endlessly. A large number of exhibition items were purchased on the spot.</p>
<p>Author's Brief History: Zhang Chongren is from Shanghai. He studied in Belgium for four years, specializing in painting and sculpture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Belgium, and has won the "Belgian Emperor's First Prize" and the "Belgian Government's Gold Medal." Last year, he also received a Belgian government award certificate and bonus. For a time he was renowned in artistic circles. Our embassy in Belgium specially transferred the Republic of China's Three Educations Medal to him. After traveling to France, England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy last autumn, he returned to Shanghai in mid-November. The success of this exhibition shows that Mr. Zhang is a rising star in our country's art world.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Executive Yuan Issues Order to Vigorously Implement the System of External Labor for Prisoners <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments, stating that: In accordance with the National Government's Instruction No. 977 of December 27, 24th year of the Republic, and the Judicial Yuan's Presentation No. 228 of December 18, 24th year of the Republic, which stated that: In accordance with the Judicial Administration Department's presentation, and the instructions of the Council's Directive No. 720, the list of proposals from the National Judicial Conference included Proposal No. 75 on vigorously implementing the system of external labor for prisoners, which was resolved by the conference and sent to the Legislative Yuan and the Judicial Yuan and the Judicial Administration Department to examine and handle the original case. It is hereby ordered that the case be examined and handled. Upon investigation, external labor for prisoners is a type of prison work, and the prison regulations already have clear provisions. Having received the foregoing, in addition to ordering the high courts of each province to instruct all new and old prisons to comply, the original proposal is transcribed below and submitted to the National Government for approval to order state-run and provincial, county, and municipal publicly-run agricultural and forestry sites to consult with nearby prisons to formulate work methods and select prisoners to go to work. Based on the foregoing, it is considered that the original proposal is reasonable in taking into account national conditions and adapting to the status and occupations of prisoners to vigorously implement external labor, and the proposed methods are also feasible. Based on the foregoing, the original proposal is enclosed and submitted for review and approval to order the said Yuan to instruct state-run and provincial, county, and municipal publicly-run agricultural and forestry sites to examine and handle the matter. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Industry to instruct state-run agricultural and forestry sites to examine and handle the matter and report back, the original attached proposal is copied and ordered that the municipal government instruct local publicly-run agricultural and forestry sites to examine and handle the matter. The original proposal is enclosed, so the attached document is copied and ordered that the bureau instruct the matter to be examined and handled in unison. This order, a copy of the original proposal, deals with vigorously implementing external labor for prisoners, No. 75. The reason is that our country is founded on agriculture, and farmers make up six or seven out of ten prisoners. Years of frequent droughts and floods have led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the bandit atmosphere has not subsided, increasing the number of prisoners. In order to seek production, the system of external labor for prisoners should, in addition to dredging rivers and building roads, be vigorously implemented in state-run or publicly-owned agricultural experimental farms, forestry bureaus, and cotton and silk experimental farms for agricultural work. These sites all have a certain range, and in terms of management, a sufficient number of guards can be allocated based on the number of workers to be stationed on site to take care of them, which is sufficient for security. Compared to dredging rivers and building roads, it is easier. The method should be for the central supreme agency to order state-run and provincial, municipal, and county publicly-run agricultural and forestry sites to consult with nearby prisons as soon as possible to formulate work methods and select prisoners to go to work.</p>
