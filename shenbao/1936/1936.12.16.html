<p>— 徐訏</p>
<p>在孟買，大概的地方我們都參觀了，我們看見特殊的商店，看見比上海印度巡捕要痩小許多的印度人，我們在博物館也看到許多印度歷史上的文化，但是對於印度的理解，至少在我，還沒有從這幾大中，孟買上船到歐洲來留學的那羣印度靑年的交談上，觀察上得到的多。博物館裏，最使我驚奇的，是印度的畫與樂器，我沒有記住牠上面所記的年代，反正在那很早的時候，其繪畫與樂器已經發達到相當的階段，而中國同時代的繪畫與音樂，似乎是遠不及牠們的。然而像這樣的民族，現在被大家輕視了，中國人也在輕視他們。</p>
<p>在那羣印度留學靑年上船以後，碼頭上那羣送行人，好像也在送我們似的，我們不期而然的把手向他們招起來。那隻船在上海啟行是早晨四時，送行的人，一二點鐘都回去了，中國學生們幾天來的疲倦在那時一睡，醒來已是七八時，船早在海中飄浮，四顧茫茫，舉目無親－所以對於那羣印度學生，能够與送行的親友拉紙與招手是感到無限的羨慕的。印度人談話的表情比中國人厲害，他們感情比中國人顯露，送行的人羣，許多少婦的大聲笑逐，似乎是中國人所沒有的。我當時想，那羣幾個有教養的印度靑年到這白色的船上與幾十個中國靑年作十來日的伴侶，用他們赤露的感情與中國青年交往，是件很有點意義的事了，雖然不是什麽形式的親善會議，至少是二個民族的接觸，是可以有點互相了解的。可是事實上並不如此！</p>
<p>印度人有許多「不文明」（？）的習慣，穿着睡衣在甲板上走，到便所常常用齷齪的脚在馬桶上蹲着解手，房間內并出一種氣味，餐桌有時還把用過的牙籤放到牙籤瓶內去，種種齦齪與隨便，不久就被中國人看輕與討厭起來，一討厭他們，自然不願意同他們再接近了。</p>
<p>但是，我對於他們這些不良的習慣是諒解的，不良習慣各民族都有，不過所顯露的方面不同吧了。像印度人這些不良習慣，在中國內地，尤其是邊疆是很常有的，大學中歐化許久的學生們或者已經褪去了落後的習慣，但我想，在各人的故鄕中，許多同胞是不是尙在許多不良習慣中生活。那些都是我們的父老，我們的兄弟姊妹，我們難道也這樣輕視他們麼？在歐洲，我現在是在巴黎，我覺得他們有許多習慣也不見得是好的，譬如一淸早，在小街上走，三四層上的居民就在你頭上打氈子，抖被單，刷衣裳，這難道是一件公德的事情。我覺得公德不是道德，只是一種習慣而已，習慣無論那一方面都有的，譬如吃東西，我們北方人初看見廣東吃蛇，引以爲奇，其實在吃蛇的人，則反會覺得不吃蛇是奇怪的。西洋人一到中國，就駡中國的種種不衛生習慣；假如這種樓窗上抖被單是中國的習慣，西洋人第一次遇到，又將怎麼樣說中國人是多多不講公德的民族了！現在不必說廣東吃蛇是野蠻，也不必因爲某人某種習慣不好，就看輕他們；自然我們不妨互相帶到好的習慣上去。我在內地，看到許多西洋的天主教教士，穿着中國布袍，布褂，布鞋，布襪，在所謂種種不良的習慣中生活，我還知道吳稚暉先生演講中，說到陳獨秀先生的公子，該死的罪名，說他是共產黨，說他齪齷不堪，臉幾天不洗，牙齒水遠不刷，同工人洋車夫在一起吃極齪齷的東西；（吳先生的口才，以及演講記錄的　畢都比我好，原稿現在無法查，所以只記一個大概。）我不是天主教徒，也不是共產黨員，但除去對這種精神的愛敬外，還慮到眞正二個人二個階級二個民族的接近與理解，是要虛心靜氣的越過這些習慣的距離的。</p>
<p>民族與民族間的距離不至習慣一種，言語文字也是我們所不能忽略的；可是言語文字則是一種隔膜，是大家都知道，本來是一時沒有法子穿過的，不過我們與印度人間，在這點上已經借英文而溝通，但爲這習慣的距離，使這决兩羣民族的優秀分子，在十餘日的同舟中，多數的人全沒有交一言；找覺得這是一件很不幸的事情</p>
<p>其實不但民族與民族間有距離。人與人間也是有距離的，將團體與團體的對立不算，個人與個人在日常生活中，若都是　起着面孔保住着難越距離麼？－尤其在都市里，十年的鄰居可以不交一言，五年的天天同電車可以不打招呼，全年到頭天天同桌吃飯，可以不說一句話，把這熱鬧的世界弄得這樣寂寞，人類到底是什麽樣的動物？</p>
<p>在上海，我住在虹口的時候，天天在電車上碰見一個女僕帶領三個孩子上學，一個大的的有十二歲，小的的有七八歲，另一個男孩子恐怕還只有六歲，有時候還同車回來。這樣常常見面也有三四月之久了。有一天我回家的時候，那三個孩子，也從中途上來了，大概是家裏有事或者有客，或者女僕離職了，總之那天會沒有人陪她們，那位大的女孩，一隻手提一隻書包，一隻手領她小弟弟，那位小女孩則提兩隻書似大的上來以後，這小女孩上來非常吃力，我在那時候帮了她一點忙，她們到沒有什麽表示，所以快下車的時候，因爲我知道她家的弄堂（胡同）是我天天定過的，所以我就說：「我替你們拿書包好了「可是出我意外，是那位大女孩釘我一眼說：「儂要那能？」而全車的人也注意我了，這注意有點輕視，不是說我在騙她書包，　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c38">沙赫特「領土擴張論」的透視 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>德經濟部長沙赫特日前在蘭克福一個紀念會席上演說大意謂殖民地之分配實爲解决目下世界各問題之唯一辦法現時德國無充分土地以供給必需之原料及糧食因此不能保證德國存在之安全而德國欲博世界的和平土地之擴張亦屬重要步驟之一其意若曰德國因爲原料和糧食供給不够所以有向其他各國要求重行分配的權利這種口吻不但是法西斯德國立國精神的充分暴露而且從中還可以看出德國因爲重整軍備的原故經濟上已到山窮水盡的階段了。</p>
<p>誰都知道德國自從一九三一年金融風潮以後國際信用大大的低落了因爲市塲競爭白熱化的原故商品出超也一年年的縮小在這種情形之下德國要在短期問從國外吸收巨量的軍需原料和糧食以完成軍備就得在金融上造成不可彌補的創痕事實昭示着德國的黃金準備和外匯在一九三三年初還各有八萬零四百萬和一萬一千四百萬馬克可是在最近十月底黃金凖備和外匯總共只剩七千萬馬克了貿易方面最近三年半期間中雖已有出超總額約六萬萬馬克然而德國却還利用「交換協定」向各國大量賒購貨物這些賒來的原料和糧食都在合同上規定着要在進口以後經過長期間才付欵的因此德國出口工業品換成了外幣便得大部分劃作償還舊欠之用換言之德國目下已完成的軍備有大部分還得靠今後工業品的繼續生產和輸出來償倖其成本的。</p>
<p>由此我們可知德國重整軍備不過使德國生產界對外的未來担負加高這對於德國金融顯然是一個致命傷德國的黃金與外匯早就十分空虛馬克如果貶値只有把債務加高如果不貶值德國價務雖可以因債權者的貨幣貶値有債務减輕的利益但德國貨物在國際市塲却也不免因價格較貴而遇着嚴重的打擊這結果軍備計劃就要動搖了。</p>
<p>近四年來德國重整軍備是一帆風順的其主要原因就在東南歐及中歐各國對德供給大批的原料和糧食到了現在情勢便有些不同其一過去東南歐及中歐各國都因德國能出較高價格收買才不顧資金被封銷的危險對德放賬到了現在世界物價已一致高起收買原料和糧食的國家也一天天加多東南歐及中歐各國自不必專靠德國的銷路其二目下德國經濟更加惡化各國和德國所成立的交換協定現在都漸漸中止了尤其在英美法三國協定之後這趨勢更加明顯由於上述兩層原因德國今後在世界市塲中繼續收買原料和糧食當然沒有以前那樣順利了。</p>
<p>總之德國今後在世界經濟上的孤立非常明顯如果她再不中止軍備擴張的計畫那就只有訴於戰爭了。</p>

<p>（倫敦）英外相艾登、今日在白萊德福特演說、籲請全世界停止軍備競爭、從事經濟合作、艾氏演辭大旨如下、</p>
<p>全世界人民如欲享永久和平、則對於目下操縱世界政治之某數種趨勢、必須加以改革、今日世界財富之用於軍備者、實屬過多、如各國堅持重整軍備、結果非陷於經濟匱乏不可、如能捨棄軍備競爭、而改事經濟合作、則其智將不可及也、吾英人極願得見此項轉變之實現、並準備盡吾人之力量以促成之、吾人之竭力使三國貨幣協定得吿成立、卽爲一例、蓋吾人之意、以爲如能根據該協定而行、必有進步之可見也、吾人亟願各國皆繼之而起、俾國際間之經濟狀况、得趨光明、各國之間、亦可有較大之繁榮機會、及希望世人之生活標準、皆能因之而提高焉、倘使世界之各種困難、一種軍備協定、而獲永外解决、則吾英人亦願傾心以助其成功、如各國需要英國作經濟或財政之援助、而圖以增加其軍備者、吾必將嚴正拒絕之、蓋其結果、將使世界之和平、感受莫大之威脅也、</p>
<p>艾氏繼又略述英國外交政策之大綱云、吾人對於任何危險主義之偏於左右兩派獨裁者、自將力予拒絕、英國與他入合作、並不以一國政府之形式爲標準、而全視其是否願與鄰邦維持和平、及能否遵守條約義務爲斷定、須知各國間遇有意見衝突之時、如能尊重條約義務、並隨時作自由談判之準備、則國際間之信任、自可、永久維持、且關於片面的廢止各種條約、亦必須有相當之限制、</p>
<p>艾氏復對於法外長台爾博斯氏日前之宣言、謂英比兩國如無故受人侵略時、法國全部軍隊將自動供英比國防之用云云、表示歡迎、惟極力否認上項宣言及其本人十一月二十日在里明頓地方之宣言、含有締結任何特別同盟或提倡聯盟政策之意、並稱以上兩種保證、不過用以應付因德國廢止羅迦諾公約、及進兵非武裝區後、所造成之局面而已、英法兩國政府不但無訂立特別辦法之心理、且頗願德國之加入合作、共同處理整個歐洲之事務、總之、吾人不願歐洲之內、有任何同盟及壁壘之存在也、</p>
<p>艾氏又回溯共在里明頓之官言中、對於英國軍備需要之程度、曾有明白之規定、蓋因世界各地皆有英國重大利益之存在、欲予以充分之保護、自不能不有相當之軍備也、故以爲加以明白之宣布、足以裨補世界之和平、而使世人無懷疑之餘地、艾氏續云、目下之世界、已較前縮小甚多、且因科學之日趨發達、世界亦更見其微小、故世界各地偶有變故、吾人之利益、卽有被波及之危險、吾人宜隨時隨地嚴于注意、决不可因事不千己、而遂加忽視、因上述理由、余已一再聲明吾國之外交政策、因國家有多數及博大之利益、故必須向博大的解决方面做去、非如此、吾人所希望之和平與信任、决難達到也云云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院本日午後舉行公開會議、討論叙利亞境內亞歷山大德萊與安蒂沃希兩城土耳其少數民族問題、當由土耳其外長魯舒第陳述該國見解、請求行政院就下列三項、分別加以考慮、（一）就目前亞安兩城土耳其民族所處地位而言、殊有採取若干種過渡辦法之必要、應請行政院予以决定、（二）關於該兩城土耳其民族問題爭議之基本要點、（三）聲明法國與土耳其兩國交誼深厚、不因一時爭議而有所影響云、魯舒第首先根據法理與經濟上觀點、說朋土耳其政府之立塲、繼對于法國認爲此一問題、係土耳其與國聯之爭一層加以辯駁、又謂亞安兩城、土耳共人口始終佔其大部分、故土耳其政府請求行政院就本問題作客觀之研究、以覓求正常合宜之解决方案、俾地方得以安寗而法理得受尊重、至在爭端未解决之時期內、則應由國聯掌握該兩城之命運、令該兩城現所駐守之法國軍隊一律撒退、代以少數中立國警察隊、而由國聯特派委員以指揮之云、魯舒第語畢、法代表卽外交次長魏耶諾當卽起立、對於魯舒第所稱法土兩國友誼一層、表示感謝之意、並聲明當於明日就本問題爭執要點有所答辯、行政院繼由魏耶諾提議、任命瑞典外長散特婁爲本案報吿員、幷定於明日上午十一時繼續開會、俾由魏耶諾出席陳述法國之見解、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院本日午前十一時三十分、賡續討論叙利亞境內亞歷山大德萊與安蒂沃希兩城土耳其數民族問題、當由法國外交次長魏耶諾發表演說、說明該國見解、藉以答辯土國外長魯舒第昨日所提出之主張、共言曰、叙利亞與黎巴嫩兩處、均係國聯會委任法國統治之地、按之國聯盟約、統治國對於委任統治地之領土完整、必須負責保障、關於此層國聯會原來所採决議、雖可加以變更、但土國關於上述兩城少數民族所提出之主張若竟付諸實施、則前途定必發生最嚴重之影響、緣上述兩城併入叙利亞版圖、爲時已歷十四年之久、今後若果加以分割、致使叙利亞獨立主權有所减削、則叙利亞境內阿拉伯民族行當猛烈表示反抗、殆可斷言、雖然、法國仍願在各該城採取各項措置、用以防止邊務糾紛或其他事故、例如國聯會指派中立國觀察員前往該處視察一層、亦可爲法國所接受云、（十五日哈瓦斯雹）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）關於叙利亞境內少數民族問題之報吿員、卽瑞典外長散特委、頃於行政院會議散會後、邀集法土兩國代表、就渠所可提出之過渡辦法（卽在爭端未解决時期內、所當採取之措置、）加以研究、法土代表常卽贊同派遣中立國視察員、前往各該城、法國代表並應允將前此安蒂沃希城發生擾亂時所派往之援軍、予以撤退、但不允將各該城原有駐軍一律撤退、而代以中立國警察隊、蓋以此項辦法、殆卽拋棄統治國之權利故也、關於此層、土代表堅持昨在行政院會議所陳述之主張、並謂如不能獲得滿意、則行政院表决過渡辦法時、卽常放棄稟權云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）關於法土兩國之爭議、此間國際方面人士聞已擬有解决辦法、其中一項最爲人所注意者、乃倣照歐戰後奧蘭羣島先例、而在各該城樹立同樣制度、（奧蘭羣島係在波羅的海、歐戰前屬于瑞與國、迨至歐戰後始改歸芬蘭國、而由各國爲之保障其中立地位）、按法國與叙利亞現行條約、規定各該城應在國聯會保護之下、歸由叙利亞國保障、今後若果採用新制度、則又增加一重保障矣（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>吾國旅美華僑摔角大家黃伯長、昨晚在聖喬琪舞塲與印度著名摔角家彌哈角鬥、觀者滿座爲悔上摔角競賽空前盛以、搏鬥之兇猛緊張、得未會見、彌哈力大如牛、黃四輕巧靈活、在第五回合中、黃以敏捷之訣巧、將彌哈擎舉空中、急轉三决、將彌哈摔倒、博得全塲掌聲與彩聲、耳爲之聾、第六回合、彌哈雖力圖報報復卒歸無效、遂歸黃君獲勝、全塲中外觀衆，一致向黃君慶賀不置、並有一妙齡西洋女子、上台與黃君接吻爲禮、</p>
<p>摔角爲印人專長</p>
<p>昨晚節目、共拳擊四次、摔角兩塲、另一塲摔角爲一印度人哈朋斯對按德生、亦爲最重量級、交手不五分鐘、按德生卽被哈朋斯摔倒、按德生不能再戰而敗、蓋摔角爲印度人之專長、其利害可知、計息十分鐘後、即爲黃伯長與彌哈上台、</p>
<p>黃君以訣巧見勝</p>
<p>彌哈體重二百二十磅、黃君則爲二百十五磅二人有千鈞之力、如二虎相鬥、小說中之人猿泰山再世、諒亦不過如此、彌哈全以力勝、專用扭臂、黃君屢吃其虧、幸黃君訣巧甚多、數度掙扎後、卽用極快之手段、以意想不到之方法解脫之、而黃君則不易將扭倒、然有幾次小臂之猛擊、（不可用拳擊、只可用小臂擊之）、及雙脚之平踢（不可用脚尖踢）、使彌哈痛苦不堪、</p>
<p>前四回無分勝負</p>
<p>二人爭鬥之兇猛、可怕萬分、堪為觀止、因氣力之高下、黃右似取多守勢、善用巧訣、每以爲無可如何之中、而黃君卒能掙脫而起、最有趣者、黃君用呵癢」使對手脫搏、全塲哄笑不已、前四局彼此平手、無分勝負、</p>
<p>黃突施驚人傑作</p>
<p>第五回合、黃君上塲即取猛攻、彌哈初被跌倒、黃君疾趨其前、用頭頂　腹部、剎時間、卽將彌哈擎舉頭上、其動作之快、使彌哈不及解脫、黃在台中急轉一轉、約半分鐘、將彌哈用力摔下、神志恍惚、力疲不起、黃君受觀衆之拍掌頓脚、歡呼如在、蓋此法爲摔角中最難之動作、亦爲致勝之唯一法門、以二百二十磅重之大漢、高舉頭上、猶急轉三次、將其摔下、誠難乎其難矣、</p>
<p>彌哈報復終失敗</p>
<p>第六回合開始、彌哈力圖報復、屢决威脅黃君、屢次扭住黃之一臂、或以雙腿力夾黃君之頭部、黃卒能　後解脫而起、是局終了、無分勝負、是賽共賽六回合、每决十分鐘、休息一分鐘、結果遂判黃君勝利、全塲歡呼之聲、力竭聲嘶、與黃君握手慶賀者、不知其數、並有某西洋女子趨前接吻、另有數印度大漢、跳上臺去、表示不服、向黃挑戰、而又有一菲律賓人代黃不平、向印人挑戰、裁判員宜佈有於下星期六再賽云、</p>

<p>粉市開盤後、各月份尙呈緩和之勢、以洋麥報價芝加哥近漲二元零、遠漲一元六角半、坎拿大無市、利物浦漲三便士零、且以陝變依然混亂、洋麥又激漲如是、市面之激昂、實在意料之中、惟市塲人心、則以洋麥之漲、恐亦國際關係、而陝局之善後、吉凶復難測、是以開價後、市面雖高、但無驚人之舉、計　開近遠均漲五六七分、惟二盤以後、因大戶回出、人心轉平、較初開反落三五分、迨至下午開盤、交易甚暢、平靜之中、仍帶昂勢、此後如陝變吿平、國外麥市、亦有回平之可能、則市面或不致過分高翔云、</p>
<p>麥市各月份一致飛蹜、以洋麥猛漲、亦為幾年來所罕見、更以陝變　覺嚴重、致業內外人心、一致望高、各月價較之前日開價、均提漲　角或五八九分不等、迨至下午開盤、交易驟暢、又以現麥喊價、亦提至九角、致買氣愈盛、遠期之　勢、又突飛猛進、較前市又漲五六分、計一日之漲度、近漲一角三分、遠漲一角七八分至二角、現麥市面、亦高提一角零、開東台高郵麥六元九角、蕪湖麥六元八角二分、浦口麥六元七角半、漢口麥六元五角半、由福新辦三千包、阜豐辦五千包云、</p>

<p>在世界張劍拔弩緊張之情形下、一切油類原料搜羅甚旺、幫近年來對外貿易生涯、以此為盛、刻下芝蔴源、因各產區礙於河道水估、搬運困難、二則農民大多不願出售、所以有供不應求之處、近日全國儲糧、又值時局突變、致糧價飛騰昨開洋苙芝蔴開出五十噸、由日商辦去、價爲十五元、實開空前紀錄、現貨毛蔴再漲四角、沙市蔴挺升至十二元四角、日商辦去六百包、其他各蔴成交三四百包、</p>

<p>（客秈）昨日客米續出長江裝到整批、機糙秈元花色不一、但以時局未定、各幫去胃均淡、囤戶以存到兩湧、未敢問津、而粵省之洋米免稅與湘米直運兩舉、雖未成爲事實　然該幫已多停手觀望、久無問訊、昨日試辦江西碎米與米粞五百五十包、河南幫車運未通、但昨已稍有問訊、汕頭亦去贛砶少數、北洋去溫秈五百包、本街續有收買、奈全日上下午總計成交不足三千包、市面與人心仍多軟弱云、</p>

<h3 id="c169">我的訪問經騐談 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 訪問員—胥松子</p>
<p>在寒風裏，我們在搏鬥。從無數條馬路，到處不淸的弄巷，幾乎是愈走愈冷寂，荒凉，除了車夫的脚步聲，合着自己的心跳。</p>
<p>時候已是冬深了啊！</p>
<p>但寒風，吹不冷我們為國貨而工作的熱情，更吹不冷中國婦女們一個巨人的愛國的良心。不是嗎：誰能說我們的家庭訪問工作，不是在跟着時間而擴大而深入呢？誰能說賢明的家庭主婦，不深受感悟而站上經濟國防的陣容來？</p>
<p>近三個月的訪問工作，不是白費的。但為了使國貨運動加强地進展，而將自己工作經歷中的一得之愚，公開起來，也不是毫無意義的事吧？</p>
<p>一　進門的技術</p>
<p>如果我們是在上午進行訪問的話。請切記不要敲着前門，這是上海一個普通情形。因為上午差不多是主婦或娘姨正在靠後門的灶間準備午餐的時候；那　子是忙得可以的，誰有空來開前門呢？</p>
<p>在下午，就完全相反了，那你就儘管大膽地掀着前門的電鈴或敲着門環都成。那是大多數人家在客堂工作或憇息的時候啊！</p>
<p>二　畏縮的人就是失敗的人</p>
<p>為什麽我們要「大膽地」掀着電鈴或敲着門環呢？因為畏縮的人，就是失敗的人！</p>
<p>請試想：你輕輕的掀着或敲着，屋子裏的人會聽見嗎？卽使聽見，從你那膽怯的手法上看來，娘姨難道還不把你當作一個生客嗎？一個和客，在這年頭大家都得不放進來的呀！到了餉你以閉門羹的時候，你是恨娘姨不好還是恨自己不好呢？所以，我們要大膽一點哪！不但這樣，當娘姨在門裏探問是誰的時候，你更要親切而大聲的答着，好像自己就是他家的至親好友一樣，自然會給你開門了。</p>
<p>三　怎樣求見主婦？</p>
<p>門開了，怎樣求見主婦呢？這就不能一槪而論了。辦法有的是，第一，要把自己在這時提醒一下，使自己更聰明一點，那是說要「臨機應變」。比如在眼前，是一個智識程度頗高的家庭，是用得着我們那個特別大的卡片的，卡片送進去後，是會得着主婦的歡迎的。否則，那個大卡片就有點使人害怕了。另一個方式是送上一些布樣，那一本本五顏六色的布樣，是很逗人的。如果有機會給你向娘姨說明來意，就是再好沒有的事了。</p>
<p>四　抓住每一個機會</p>
<p>再說「臨機應變」訪問工作，眞是有十二分的重要。不用說，你見着了主婦，看見了她身邊有一個以上的孩子，你就要從孩子身上談起，如若她手裏在結絨綫呢？就得講求編結的式樣了，這樣一來，話到投機，就可進行關於國貨問題的討論來，結果會無往而不利的。不僅如此，比如說，你有走進人家的屋子，那你可以利用着一個剛走進屋子的人，同她談着，可以使你在無形中免去進屋的難關；同樣，要求一兩個在馬路上或弄內玩要的小孩，要他領你回他家裏去，也是一個好的辦法。至於，熱情的主婦，肯領着你向熟人家介紹，更是成功的工作了。</p>
<p>五　站在驕傲的主婦面前</p>
<p>自然，大部份的主婦是很能接受我們的意見的。但站在驕傲的主婦面前，就頗難應付了。那時，你大致得向她慊恭地說着下面的話：</p>
<p>「我這次的來府上，是很冒昧的，這樣來打擾女士們也有一個信念，就是為了國貨而工作。我們為使國貨日見改進，必須前來家庭，聽取學識淍博。經騐豐富而熱心愛國的女士們的高見……」</p>
<p>像這一類的說話，不能給感動的人是很少的了。</p>
<p>六　如何說服低見的主婦？</p>
<p>「提倡國貨，是挽救國家經濟危機的有效辦法。」</p>
<p>服用國貨是國民應盡之天責。請如此類的宣傳口號，在低見的主婦耳朶裏，是會失去刺激的力量的。</p>
<p>我們要把口號改低一點才成。譬如這樣同她說：「中國人用中國貨，中國的錢，只能把中國人賺，若買外貨，中國的錢，不是把外人賺去了嗎？」又譬如說：「王家兄弟二人，哥哥的錢給弟弟用，總是家裏人用，假使給張三李四用，那怎麽行呢，」這種巧妙的說法，效果自然很大啊！</p>

<h3 id="c170">陳壽豐君訪問記 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 江俠</p>
<p>經友人王君的介紹，才得認識這位陳壽豐先生，要不是王君說明，誰會相信這樣年靑，這樣篤實的人，竟是創辦過十數種實業的實業家。一陣客套過後，我們的談話便開始：</p>
<p>「陳先生創辦綢織的動機，可否吿我？」我問。</p>
<p>「唔，綢業嗎！說來誰都不會相信，我對於綢業本無一些根蒂的。而創辦的起因，是因為父執施少初先生所創設的祥昌綢廠，成績欠佳，亟需人整頓，屢屢的邀我去担任，首先我有些畏怯，後來我打定了「祗要努力趕去，那怕不成」的宗旨，才敢接受下經理之職。第一年雖虧損了一萬多元，可是到了明年的四五月裏却已把所蝕的賺回，廠的範圍也逐漸擴充，資金也由五萬元增至一百萬元。後來出品實在無法供應，於是，才定了一種發料制，却不料會種下現在的百步一廠的因。」說罷，吸了一口烟，面露笑容。</p>
<p>「陳先生在辦綢廠之前，曾辦過何種事業？」</p>
<p>「染織廠和牙刷廠都是在我二十歲左右所辦的，後來染織業曾一度和劉國鈞先生合作過，不久因劉先生要赴常州去開辦紗廠，無暇顧及，於是便無形的解股了。不過，這廠至今尚維持着」</p>
<p>「牙刷事業在中國還是新興的工業吧？」</p>
<p>「是的，我辦振宇牙刷廠的時候，中國還是僅有。那時我眼見到外貨牙刷的充斥我國市塲，便蓄志想創立一牙刷工廠。經過一年餘的籌備，又得家父的極力輔助，才得成立。雖然是短蝕了五萬餘元，可是，外貨的絕跡，於精神上却是感到十分愉快的。至於，現在牙刷製造業，變為家庭小工業，在我初創時是萬萬想不到的」</p>
<p>「先生，對於辦玻璃有何意見？」</p>
<p>「唔，這事　是很難辦的，卽以我去年收歇的中山玻璃廠而言。營業是非常的發達，僅是玻璃杯一項，日銷達千餘打之多，可是，工人知識的淺薄，不能與廠方聯絡，終歸於失敗了。所以敎育的不普及，於實業的前途，確是非常危險的。」陳先生很不高興的說着。</p>
<p>陳先生的談鋒很健，愈談愈有勁了，不知不覺的已談了一刻多鐘，旁邊已有二人等着接洽事宜，我便吿辭了出來。</p>
<h3 id="c171">國貨發展的前途 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>最近我們國貨工業的很有發展，無疑義地是的確的事實，本年一月至七月的國產產銷狀况，——它的銷額，較去年同期，要增到三分之一以上，同時各地中國國貨公司的紛紛成立，到現在已有十二處之多，遍及全國各大都市，漸佈成全國產銷合作之綱，這種良好的現象，它一方面是徵明國貨運動的高漲，現已獲到全國廣大民從的愛護，而另一方面，是更徵明它對於整個國民經濟建設運動的前途，已奠下了最堅固不拔的基礎。</p>
<p>雖然，在眼前，我們對整個國貨的發展前途，應該來一個新的估計，和新的檢討，我們要知道，最近國產的漸有暢銷的原因在那裏？他的前途，到底還有什麽問題在阻撓？這是我們每一個從事國貨的人，應該明瞭，為開展未來的工作，那是十分必要的。</p>
<p>在這裏，我想對國貨前途稍有認識的人，是立刻可以曉得，本年來國貨得有進展的主因，就是在第一，因為內地匯水的低跌，和各地的豐收，促進民眾購買力的增加，第二，國貨廠商自身的努力推銷，貨價低於洋貨，及積極向粵川及西北各地的推進等，而它的前途的障礙，最大的却就是走私問題的橫阻，最近華北更有徵收私貨特稅的傳聞，（僅及關稅八分之一）將使私貨可以公開活躍國內市塲，這實是我整個國貨界生死存亡的問題，我們希望他不是事實，否則我們要據理力爭，以謀解决的。</p>
<p>其他，關於國貨發展的前途，我們尚要力謀（一）國內交通建設的進步，使國貨可以便利運銷內地，（二）希望內地當局，取消各種有礙國貨發展的特稅，以輕負担，（三）應與南洋華僑極誠合作，開拓國外市塲，務使國貨進展到海外去。</p>
<p>總之，國貨前途的發展，是很有希望的，只要我們今後大家更大的努力！</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中國國貨工厰之失敗，不在外貨之傾銷，而在同業之傾軋。某種出品，明明已有某厰出品，足供需求，欲羨其利者，不知輕重，不自量力再設一厰以與之競爭，譬如某種國產品，年有五百萬元之銷路，而現有之工厰，計有五百萬元以上之生產，已感出品之過剩，乃異軍特起，有人又辦一厰，忽參加競爭，結果，新辦之厰，不免慘敗，而原有之厰，千篇一律，思之猶有餘悸。故吾人常願國貨工厰，急應注意整個問題，當有統盤籌盡之方法。而企業家之欲設新場者，亦應審察利害，慎重投資，勿僅僅以一時之小利為得利。最近民豐造紙厰，為統計國內捲煙紙產銷現狀，忠告全國企業家，慎重投資一事，頗合吾人之原旨，确為國貨工業進步之一證。目下捲煙紙生產，民豐一厰，如開足兩機，年有八十四萬捲之多，而國內所需，已括外商在內，至多為七十四萬捲，已成略有過剩，照此情形，捲煙紙生產，已足自給，如果再設新厰，則供過於求太甚，必致中跌價傾銷，害人害已，與其同歸於盡，何如另謀別徑？國內應辦之工業甚多，何必定欲就人所已辦與辦而已感過剩之國產，來紊亂市場自取失敗耶？我國生產事業，塗徑甚多，儘可從整個國民經濟立場，審察需求之狀況，慎重投資之方針，務使辦一種工業，國家受其利，民眾蒙其澤，而社會亦因以繁榮，外貨亦由此歛跡，此種工厰，多一家，即國家厚一分實力，社會增一分元氣。一言以蔽之：着手不難，在能『產銷相應供求適合』而已。</p>

<h3 id="c175">姬家店裏的女兒 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 周寳</p>
<p>民國十一年—我　着叔嬸，從安徽的亳州，前往南宿州，搭津浦車回蘇。在亳宿的途中，忽聞三十里前，發生匪警，於是只得在一個蘇皖交界處的靑鹿　宿。　的是一　所僅有的姬家店。設備的簡陋，是不用說了。當時本擬一宿卽行的，不意前途的匪兵　戰，一天一天的相持着，於是我們也只得一天一天的在姬家店裏挨着。一直挨到了第五天，在淸早，後院裏，發生了一陣嘈雜的人　。嬸子從睡夢中，給驚醒過來。忽然不見了叔叔，於是跑到隔房來找找。我忙一骨碌爬起，披衣而往後院，只見叔叔和一個女孩兒，給背封背的捆着，放在坑上。那女孩兒，我是認識的，是姬家店裏的女兒。雖然皮膚是相當的白皙，一雙足兒，也相當的　小，（那時在那邊農村中，婦女還以小足為美），但那一對鬭雞眼兒，是在第一天，便已引起了我的注意的。</p>
<p>在那時候，坑前站着五個大漢，聲勢洶洶的，要把我叔叔送官，說是姦佔閨女。後來他們知道我和我叔叔的關係，於是轉而向我恐嚇着。當時，我給嚇得目瞪口呆，不知所措。結果，還是由我叔叔，自己和他們談妥了，以四十六吊錢解决着，而恢復了自由。恰巧這一天的中午，那老車夫說，前面已經平靜了，於是我們一行，便狼狽地離了姬家店。當大車拉出靑鹿溝時，晨間所見的那五個大漢都喝得滿臉飛紅的，迎面過來。老車夫哈哈地笑道，「做到了好買賣拉」。其中一個答道，「甚麽好買賣，咱們哥五個，只得了凈八吊錢」。待到那五人走過了，老車夫，有一句没一句的，吿诉我们，姬家店裏那女兒，凈做這些仙人跳的故事。於是一路上，我叔叔，是凈給我嬸子嘰咕到蘇州才止。</p>
<p>回鄉了不到五年，我叔嬸是相繼故世了。這一幕滑稽劇，也逐漸地在我腦中，像烟一般的消散了。不意在上個月裏，在我的滬寓對門的平房裏，遷來了一家拉塌車的。一天，忽聽我家的傭婦，和那家的婦人搭訕時，那婦人，自己說是安徽靑鹿溝人。我心中一動，留心一瞧，輪廓依稀，而且一雙鬭雞眼，還是別來無恙。於是我不禁的失聲道，「你是姬家店裏的閨女呀。」伊聽了，臉兒一紅，裝着沒聽見的走開了。從此，見了我，便老遠的廻避着。在上星期裏，寂然地搬走了。</p>
<p>十餘年不見，伊已蒼老得不像一個中年婦人，而且已是一個五個孩子的母親了。但是伊怎麽也會漂流到這個都市裏來的呢？這是一個謎，或許是永遠不會給我知道的了。</p>
<h3 id="c176">街頭製造家 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>揑粉人的，被人捧為街頭的藝術家了，但我却還在街頭，找到了不少街頭實業家。在我家的弄口，設着不少的攤子。第一個，先說那個沒有招牌的所謂「香烟公司」。那是一個乞丐樣兒的漢子，蹲踞在地上，捲製着香烟。他用一個再也簡單不過的，木製而中間繃有一條皮帶的捲烟機製造的。在皮帶上，堆放了烟絲，再放着黏有漿糊的捲烟用紙，於是輕輕地向上一推，一支香烟，便滾出來了。雖然這是用手工製造的，但因他手法的純熟，一天，可以製造四百支左右。雖然他在每一支上，得賺三個小錢，但是價格是比了普通的廉價香烟，還低廉，所以在附近住居的工人，小店員之類，都是他的每天的老主顧了。每天，四百支，他是儘不用愁生產過剩的。</p>
<p>第二個，該算是在攤上掛着「餅乾大王」的那個。不過這個餅乾製造，是很滑稽的。雖然他的招牌，是餅乾大王，而他所製售的，却自己說是雞蛋片。而在實際上，他所用的原料，却是絕對沒有雞蛋的，所用的，倒實在是制造餅乾用的糖與麵粉，和着些兒水分而已，他的製造用具，是二對烙鐵，一個炭風爐。在烙鐵上，舀上一勺麵粉漿，把烙鐵合攏，擱在風爐上烘着，於是着手在第二個烙鐵上，舀漿。待到第二個烙鐵，放上風爐，而換下第一個烙鐵來時，裏面的所謂「雞蛋片」，早已成熟了。這麽循環不已的製着，一天，倒也能製成五六百塊。這五六百塊，是完全銷給弄內兒童們的。代價，是每片五支文，五片二十文。他的利潤，是一個子兒上賺三文。但若只買他二片，他倒有四文的利潤。</p>
<p>還有一個，是大餅攤。說得冠冕堂皇些，簡直是平民的麵包公司老闆，是改着製售所謂「衛生汽水」，與「衛生鮮橘水」的。他的招牌，是「王廣利」三字，但這是無關宏旨的，因為他的主顧，十之八九，都是不認識字的。他的衛生汽水，是冷開水內，加入糖汁，小蘇打。半尺高的瓶兒，每瓶三打十文。鮮橘水，是用橘汁果子露，替代小蘇打的，每瓶四十文。生涯鼎盛。最熱時，每天可賺二千文左右，因為他在衛生汽水，與鮮橘水之中，是放着些兒冰屑的，所以很為主顧所歡迎。</p>
<p>這些，雖然規模簡陋得不成話兒，但名之曰街頭製造家，我想倒是名實俱副的。</p>

<p>國器對了那桌上的信封望着，不說讓友梅拿走，也不攔阻着。友梅緩緩的走近了桌子邊，把那小信封托在手上，輕輕顛了兩顛，笑道：這裏面是什麽東西，我倒有點猜不出來。國器笑道：這也無非是千里寄鵝毛，物輕人情重罷了。友梅聽到他這句話，這就看透了他的意思了。看看那信封上寫的永以為好四個字，便含了微笑，向紙包點了幾點頭。國器道：這是我用詩經上的成語。投我以木桃，報之以瓊瑤，非報也，永以為好也。本來我引用這話，就有些不通。人家所送的金戒指，比桃子要貴重千百倍。我送人家的兩粒紅豆，那比上瓊瑤，更差千萬倍。我不道重在非報她那三個字罷了。友梅並不理會這個，因笑道：我拿去了。國器點點頭　：你太熱心。友梅道；剛才表哥說，他已是無須這種紀念品了，我倒有點不服氣。回頭我見了他，看他是否需要的。國器道我覺得　待朋友，這一顆心是至誠的。至於朋友能不能諒解，我可不敢說。友梅站定了脚，却半斜了身子，向他身上看去，微笑道：表哥，我走了，你還有什麽話嗎？國器道：我沒有什麽話。說着這話，也向他看去。見他兩腮上擦的白粉，已透着潮潤，端坐久了，也不曾和人家預備扇子，人家有些香汗涔涔了。便兩手　住摺扇，向　高拱着道：倒勞累了你了。友梅笑道：我們還客氣嗎？表哥！他就在這呌表哥的聲中，點上一個頭，怱怱的走了。當他由面前過去的時候，身上還落下了一陣微微的香氣。國器也不免對他起了一點感想，覺得他與夢蘭一打比，那簡直是兩個世的人，但他　　和朋友帮忙，那是難得的。不知道他有了這種境遇，夢蘭能不能這樣去帮他的忙呢？只是她是一個極文靜而又見人先　　的人，恐怕做不到這樣爽直利落。也唯其如此，所以他就吃了這一點性情溫和的虧，</p>

<p>傳說虎尾腥羶，它餓時垂尾江邊，誘魚果腹。不道如此龐然大物，為它在饑不擇食時遷就了些聯勝於無，有時竟致送命於細小之口。岳州的城頭靠近江口，有一只老虎正在垂尾誘魚，恰値一隻大龜在水中經過，聞得腥味，突然探首水面，一口含住虎尾，牢牢不放。虎痛極了，疾忙聳身一躍，無巧不巧地墮入城頭堞齒間。虎在堞內，包在堞外，那副形狀好似挑着的擔子一般。虎痛得擺尾更快，龜就嚇得咬尾更緊。有人在城下看見了，落得前去把它們雙雙捉住。接着，那人宰了虎，却送到江邊放了那龜，報牠擒虎之功。</p>

<p>就為了這種男變女，女變男的事情時常會發生，因而奧令匹克委員會在當運動會中的女選手發生了性別問題時，便弄得不知所措；故而起草了一條新章，規定將來的運動選手，在參加競賽之前，須經醫師檢騐過。</p>
<p>醫學上研究的結果，發現這種變性是由於腎上腺的關係，腎上腺是兩上二吋左右，扁半形的，褐黃的東西，附在腰子上部前邊面上，無輸送管，直接將分泌物輸入血液中；它在健全時，和性的發育有極重要的關係。要如不健全時，它能改換女子的皮膚成為粗糙的生毛的男子皮膚，它也能使女子溫柔的女性聲音改變，成低沉而粗俗的男子聲音，使她厭惡男性，顛倒愛惡。</p>
<p>把獸類的二個腎上腺割去，四十八小時後，牠道便死了。就證明了腎上腺也是生命中必需的官能。</p>
<p>十年前，倫敦的十字醫院裏來了一個女病人，她的病症是：臉上出鬚，身體的輪廓變成近於男子的身體輪廓，例如肩膀長闊，盤骨也長大；骨骼與肌肉發達過度；皮膚變粗；聲音低沉；性器官發育不成熟；乳房不豐滿；對男子心理上的觀念也改變。經過腹部解剖後，發現有一個腎上腺漲大了，經外科醫師腎上腺專家勃洛斯　（Lennox　Ross　Broster）在第一次行手術時，便把那漲大的腎上腺割去，而那女子臉上和臂上的叢毛也立刻消失了，聲音也復原為女性的聲調：一向扁平的乳部也變成豐滿了。</p>
<p>這種發現和醫治都得歸功於勃洛斯　醫師，他至今還在對此孜孜研究不輟呢。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c184">我國駐日大使館的今昔 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>中日兩國只有一衣帶水之隔，關係最密，所以兩國間國際間交涉歷史亦最久。最近國交調整，提携親善的口頭禪，又甚　塵上，於是東我國駐日大使館，更緊張的被人注目了。</p>
<p>我國駐日大使館是在東京麻布區，附近有意大利蘇俄等使館，可以說是日本外交集中的地方。最初遜淸光緒七年派何如章為第一任駐日公使，後來中日之戰發生，公使館全體便下旂歸國。共和成立之後，於民國二年任馬廷亮為駐日公使。蔣作賓氏是於民國十九年東渡為駐日公使的，後來於去年十月蔣氏昇格為駐日大使。蔣氏任期已有二三年，駐日時間最長。現在的許世　，便是本年四月中來日的。</p>
<p>在日本要看到中國的國旂是困難的事情，普通會塲上萬國旂中，雖然也有我國的靑天白日滿地紅的旂幟，不但尺寸不合，十一隻角也說不定的。我國大使館的鐵門上便有一個巨大的黨徽，靑白紅三色的國旂，飄揚在日本帝國的空中，除大使館外。恐怕只有留學生監督處的屋頂上，還有懸掛國旂的資格了。北平東交民巷的外國使館，都有各國軍隊駐紥着，而我國駐日大使館的門外，駐着一個日本警察，詢問着謁見大使的賓客，據說從前大使館因了某種關係，而請求日本警視廳設立這個門崗，至今相沿成習，尚未撤去。</p>
<p>大使館的房屋原來是德川賴倫候的別墅，現在改築一所二層的洋房。外面一個簡單的庭園，很像歐美鄉間的小住宅。樓上大使的會客室裏，是富有日本趣味的裝飾。幾個福建漆的花瓶，很幽靜的點綴着。墻壁上沒有我國國粹的字畫，只有一個巨大的湘繍，是一隻斑爛的猛虎。記得從前法國的老虎總理，和我國小貓代表，成為外交界的珍話。的確我們中國現在缺少老虎外交，以打破國際間的危機。</p>
<p>在日本大震災時，我國華僑在橫濱東京的，被害不少。當時大使館對於華僑，沒有確實的統計，一時又無從調查。現在除留學生由留學生監督處，負責管理之外，大使館兼理僑務，上月中為了國選關係，忙着調查僑民的狀况，和從前大不相同了。日本雜誌上說駐日各國大使館凡十一，內中以蘇俄及中國大使館為最活動，那是天曉得的。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>我國建設事業，近年來突飛猛進，尤以交通方面發展爲更速。長途電話，佔交通上之重要地位，經交部之積極經營，歷載建設，與時並進，通話地點，無遠勿屆。九省電話，旣聯絡告成，而滬漢滬粵無綫電話，亦已先後正式開放營業。在國內用無綫電作遠程之交談者，斯實爲首創，然滬漢尚有有綫電話，可以直達，而滬粵則無之，故社會人士希望滬粵兩地通話者，更較滬漢通話爲允切，今焉一旦告成，使兩地民衆，均得利用交談，有同晤對，其快慰爲何如！</p>
<p>滬粵間本亦可架設銅綫，設置帮電站，作有錢電之通話，但路綫遙遠紆迴曲折間，更多崇山峻嶺，施施建築，因難殊多，且桿綫材料，需用旣繁，廠費允鉅，亦爲目前經濟所不許，故交部計畫，先於滬漢粵三處，設立通話電台，裝置通話機械，互爲聯絡，庶於顧全經濟之中，仍得呼應自如之便。有綫無綫，本屬一體，相輔爲用，成效更昭。我人於試用滬粵無綫電之初，聆話音之淸晰，覺收音之美滿，實與有錢通話，固無二致也。</p>
<p>南粵天富，無論政治商業，均佔全國重要地位，往昔，以山較修阻，交通未善，中吳與地方間，易起隔膜，於是軍閥乘機竊據，獨霸天南，同屬國土儼如另具境界，別有一天，經此無綫電之溝通，則所謂天南者，同室而已，談話便捷，積愫可罄；更何意見隔賅之有</p>
<h3 id="c186">耶誔前後 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>

<p>流光如矢，此一年一度之耶誕節，又轉瞬卽至，耶誕雖爲西方佳節，但旣過耶誕，新歲又臨，耶誕與新年，祗隔數天，故慶祝耶誕與賀年，往往連帶而不分離。</p>
<p>擅於社交的入們？對於耶誕及新年，自不肯輕易放過，常在耶誕節前，預備如何作兩地問之伸賀，表示相互間之情感，於是或者送禮，或者害片，更隆重者則拍發賀耶誕及賀年電報。</p>
<p>用電報賀年，在西方各國，乃社會習見之事，他們對於分居兩地間之至親好友，以爲祇送一張印就之卡片，簽一本人名字，似乎太簡單，不足以表示熱烈的誠意，所以除去卡片不用，而用電報。這種賀年電報，乃是親筆所書，且亦很鄭重地簽名共上，如果發寄與到達　地方，可以利用傳眞電報，他們必藉傳眞送達，使得到賀年電之人親見其字，不啻親見其人，當然能得非常快慰。</p>
<p>在耶誕與新年間旅行的入們，尤希望至親好友，有賀年電發來，俾可於寂寞的旅途中，得到一種安慰。所以航行大洋中的船舶，於十二月二十五日前後常不絕地由無綫電機上，收到多數向乘客賀年的電報。乘客在長途旅程中，接到親友或愛人的賀電往往反覆凝閱，不忍釋手，在腦海中留一極深刻之印象。</p>
<p>此外與國外人士，有交接往來，或有有商業關係者，對茲隆重之耶誕及新年，相互祝賀，更非利川電報以表示情愫不可，若區區卡片，遠道郵遞，不特到達旣遲，而受者亦以尋常目之，不以爲重也，總之，耶誕與新年賀電，自有其妙的用，决不能與一紙卡片等量齊觀</p>

<p>— 山榮海</p>
<p>辦理某種事業，必有某種糾紛發生，此非事業辦理不善之惡現象，而實爲事業過程中不能免之一種趨勢也。辦理電話事業，亦何獨不然。惟此種糾紛，偶一說破，雙方卽可諒解，今試說明之如左；</p>
<p>（甲）關於市內電話者，有下列兩種：</p>
<p>（一）局方接綫員回答「等一等」之糾紛（指非自働電話）——每有用戶，遇呌呼某號，而局方接錢員回答「等一等」時，往往誤爲該接綫員之故意爲難，而表現不良印象。庸詎知雙方電話之溝通，在接綫生方面，不過將塞子挿入，卽可了事，何用爲難？當其呌呼某號時，適某號之閘口有塞子在內，卽某號方與他戶通話，然則何能再爲塞通乎？此種糾紛，偶爲說破，卽可瞭然矣。卽如自働電話，某號方與他號通話時，其不能再與其他戶號相通也正同。</p>
<p>（二）用戶不報號數而僅呌戶名之糾紛（指非自働電話）——有種用戶不願在號簿上翻尋受話用戶之號數，卽以戶名呌接，在接錢員方面，勢必請其報號，以符規定。蓋接綫員腦中决不能記憶如許用戶號數也。於是該用戶認爲禮貌不周，責函紛至，殊不知局方之印發號簿，卽爲各用戶翻閱號數而辦，今棄號簿而不閱，僅以戶名報接，試問接綫員之記憶力，能如此廣博乎？卽如自働電話，如不明瞭受話者之號數，其能撥動而通話乎？故發話用戶，僅報戶名，實爲一種不合宜之習慣，應予袪除，以免此種無謂之糾紛。</p>
<p>（乙）關於長途電話者亦有下列兩種</p>
<p>通話時間之計算——長途發話人，對於通話時間之計算，往往有討價還償之糾紛：例如局方認爲五分鐘，應算二决者，彼必堅稱未到三分鐘，應算一次計費。此種糾紛，固亦爲人情之常，但不知局方計算時間，完全立於大公無私地位。且國營事業，遠非其他專以貿利之商業可比。各種章則，均以法令公佈，局方何能擅自改變？且發一長途電話，發方與受方均須登記時間，局力辦事人員，何能擅自增加或縮减以蹈違犯章則之罪？不過此種糾紛，亦有其相當之主因，蓋發話者，當其注意談話時，不覺時問過去之如此迅速，以爲略談幾句，何能卽已四五分鐘？但局方人員，應請加以信任，决不妄爲增减，故有若干發話人，有時向局方堅索發話時間久暫之憑據，允爲不能免除糾紛之因素，關於此點，大部現正設法採用印時機，必可使發話人滿意者也。</p>
<p>（二）等待接通之糾紛在話務繁忙之綫路方面，發話人因久待不通，於是心焦冒火，嘖有煩言，甚致有在候話處咆哮者！關於此層，固屬爲國家建設尚未充份發展，而使民衆尚有不便之一種，偶有現象，但業務之起落，正如潮水一般，有時只要一綫已足應付，有時則雖敷設十綫，亦虞不够也。故發話人之等待通話，在各國均有此種現象，好在現定章程，如過二小時後，卽可免費退號。如能在此二小時內接通，已爲今日物質文明之好現象。吾人正不必心焦冒火，而猶嫌共爲久待也。如果眞無時間相待，不妨改發電報，亦爲補救辦法，甚望收發話人，對於此點，有深切諒解。</p>
<h3 id="c188">長途電話之銷號問題 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>電話局或兼辦長途電話之電報局（以下簡稱電局）對於長途電話因故不能通話，或因發話人之請求，得將發話人聲請之掛號取銷，並分別情形收取銷號費或免收銷號費。現行交通部國內長途電話營業通則內，已有詳細規定，茲分別縷述如次：</p>
<p>（一）照章應收銷號費者：</p>
<p>（甲）受話方面本應振鈴喚呌　發話入呌接之某地某號電話，如經發話局接通受話局後，由受話局振鈴喚呌受話人之市內話機，但受話用戶無人應答或故意不應呌喚者，其咎不在電局，故因上述情形致未能通話者，應卽銷號，並由發話人照章繳納鉗號費，</p>
<p>（乙）指定之受話電話號碼係屬空號　凡長途電話用戶指定之對方受話電話號碼，經受話局查明該號確係空號，無法接通，則電局不任其咎，故發話人對於該項掛號致不能通話者，照章必須繳納銷號費也。</p>
<p>（丙）電局無法傳呼之通話　傳呼通話發話人指定之受話人住址，如經受話局派差按址傳喚去後，因住址錯誤或欠詳而無法傳呼受話人者，在電局方面已盡傳呼之責，故發話人接得電局通知無法傳呼受話人，致不能通話者，須照章繳納銷號費。</p>
<p>（丁）受話人未呌到或不願接話　發話入指定之受話人，經受話局按照發話局所述受話人住址派差前往傳呼後，如因受話人及其指定之代表均因事他往，無人前來接話，或受話人對於該發話人發來之電話，不願接聽者，發話人經電局通知未能呌到受話人或受話人不願前來接話致不能通話者，均，須照章繳付銷號費。</p>
<p>（戊）發話人不接話　發話入用市內電話或專綫電話向電局掛號呌接長途電話後，受話局業已呌到受話人，發話局亦已振鈴喚呌該發話人之市內或專綫話機，但發話入因急要事故他往，以致未能答應電局回呌之鈴聲；或發話人業經電局通知受話人已呌到，而臨時因故忽然不願接話，致不能通話者，應卽照章繳付銷號費。</p>
<p>（己）受話人延遲接話　長途電話之受話人接受電局傳呼通知後，如逾一小時尚未前往接話，電局未便久待卽予銷號並照章向發話人徵收銷號費。</p>
<p>（庚）受話人住址距離電局過遠　按照現行交通部國內長途電話營業通則第五條之規定，傳呼通話以受話人在電局營業區域以內者爲限，共未定營業區域者，以離局三公里爲限。傳呼通話發話人指明之受話人住址，如經受話局查明已逾上項規定之距離，受話局自未便派差傳呼，因此致不能通話者，發話人亦須照章繳納銷號費。</p>
<p>上述各項受話人及發話人未能通話情形，雖極複雜，但其原因不外受話或發話之一方不能前來接話或不願接話，在電局方面旣已盡喚呌及傳呼之責任，自可不任其咎，故現行交通部國內長途電話營業通則內規定，凡遇有上述情形之一，電局得予銷號：並向發話人照收銷號費也。</p>
<p>（二）照章免收銷號費者：</p>
<p>（甲）電話機綫損壞　發話人將受話地名，受話電話號碼或受話人姓名住址，通話種類，及本人電話號碼曁住址等項告知電局掛號後，發話局如因長途話錢或話機發生障礙，以致不能接通受話電局及受話用戶時，發話人當可請求銷號，並照章免納銷號費。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c189">自本月起實行之長途電話新通則 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>銷號辦法均有規定　改善之點計十有一</p>
<p>交通部新訂國內長途電話營業通則，定本月一日正式實行，此項新則改善頗多，茲將該通則與舊則不同之處誌之如下：</p>
<p>（一）長途電話受話人被呌通時，適値其爲市內通話者，受話局得徵詢受話人之同意，中斷其市內通話，改接長途電話。</p>
<p>（二）舊章呌某地某號電話，未指定某某人接話之長途通話，現改稱呌號通話。又舊章四接某地某號電話，並指定某某人接話之長途通話，原名預告電話，現改稱呌人通話，發話人等自經該項「呌號」「呌人」確定後，當能一目了然識別話類。至舊章之預的通話，改爲定時通話，亦經部令飭知實行。</p>
<p>（三）舊章呌接預告電話者，須加納普通話費之三分之一呌接，傳呼電話者，須加納專力費洋一角，新通則內規定，傳呼通話價目與呌人通話價目相同，不另收專力費。</p>
<p>（四）新通則銷號費，大致較舊章低廉，不及尋常呌號話費三分之一。</p>
<p>（五）現行普通電話價目表規定之目，係尋常呌號價目。傳呼通話價目，呌人通詁價目，及銷號費價目，另須查閱國內長途電話分類價目對照表以免錯誤</p>
<p>（七）傳呼範圍以離局三公里爲限，較前减少二公里，而傳呼專力費取銷。</p>
<p>（八）發話人掛話後，在未經收到接話之通知以前，得更改話類，惟以尋常改爲加急及呌號改爲呌人爲限。</p>
<p>（九）呌入通話之發話人，除指定某一受話人外，同時得指定該受話人之代表一人。</p>
<p>（十）發話掛號後因綫路擁塞，致尋常通話守候至二小時，（舊章須滿四小時）加急守候至一小時，（舊章二小時）尚未通話者，得免費銷號。</p>
<p>（十一）在話務繁忙時，將連續通話决數限制至三次爲度。</p>
<p>上述各點，或係手續上之劃一，或係納費上之調整，皆係長途電話業務之改進也。</p>

<p>— 森垚</p>
<p>德國的文學雖然有着十分悠久的歷史，但其眞正成熟時期卻在十七世紀以後，而其蜚聲世界，　耀百代，實為十八世紀間古典主義文藝所完成的功績。嚴格地說，他們的文學能在世界文學史上占得主要的一席，不過一二百年間的事，而這期內創建最多的人物，當推所謂六大詩豪，就中除勒新，微蘭，歌德等人外，席勒便是元勳之一。</p>
<p>在歐洲，德國人的詩歌，永遠保有最大的榮譽。至於戲劇，尤其是悲劇和詩劇，實很少其他國家可與爭勝。假使誰有一個企圖：想涉獵德國文學，他必得抓住這兩個對象。卽使你只要窺見他們的文學的輪廓，對於十八世紀間的戲劇，亦為必須認識的部門，論到這期內的戲劇，除了歌德的浮士德外，席勒的全部作品，當占着完全重要的地位。</p>
<p>席勒（Frrederich　Schiller，1759——1805）為一自然詩人，富於理智，長於念慮，他的劇本，具有嚴密的結構，細緻的內容，一般推崇為德國最大戲曲家，雖其詩才略遜於哥德，但他的劇作永遠凌駕着諸詩豪——這是批評家所公認的。</p>
<p>席氏的名劇，共有九種，若照發表時期的先後而論，可排列如下：（一）刧賊（Die　Rauber）；（二）飛斯科的作亂（Die　Verschoworungdes　Fiesco）；（三）陰謀和愛情（KabaleundL—iebe）；（四）頓卡羅斯（Don　Carlos）；（五）華倫斯泰（Wallenstein）；（六）馬利亞，斯圖亞特（Maria　Stuarl）；（七）奧爾良之少女（Die　Jungfrau　Von　Orleans）；（八）麥息那新婦（Die　B—raut　Von　Meseina）；（九）威廉退爾（WilhelmTell）。</p>
<p>由此我們可以知道，席氏諸劇中，威廉退爾為最後的一本。因作者的技巧愈趨老練，思想達於成熟，這本戲劇產生後，幾乎無可批評；不特在德國古典派中，揀不出可與比倫的作品，就在近代世界戲劇中也難求其選，因其具最適於表演的特質，至今還是舞台上風行的脚本。</p>
<p>席氏一般作品，比較地說，用詞遣句，往往略嫌深奧，而且有數種劇本上，過分染上了憂鬱色彩，因此J.　Macy在所著世界文學史話中有着下列的講話：</p>
<p>「…對於其修辭和時常發現的感傷性的批評，成為普通的事。……但最美的劇本如威廉退爾…依然是有活力的，劇底的生動的東西……」——根據胡仲持譯本。</p>
<p>眞的，無論你怎樣地對席氏的作品吹毛求疵，但威廉退爾的偉大，是任誰也不能否認的。</p>
<p>威廉退爾是一部歷史的悲劇，取材於瑞士獨立中的一段故事，當德車哈布斯堡皇室轄治着瑞池·鳥里·下林等處的時候，他們派遣的總督，是一個凶虐無情的葛思來，他統率着一帬　官在瑞士境內施行各種欺壓政策，使人民完全失卻了他們所認為天賦的自由，於是從農·工人·奴隸間揮動了革命的火炬，在一致團結禦侮的决心下，勝利地恢復了他們的自由，驅除了暴虐的長官，完成了獨立的基業。</p>
<p>威廉退爾在本劇中，是以一個强健豪邁博愛和平的人格登塲的，他仗着熟練的箭枝，魁梧的體魄，處處援救着被壓迫的同胞，最後建立了爭自由的最偉大功績——刺殺葛思來。他原沒有對統治者的宿怨，甚至十分尊敬長官，據說：他某次打獵經過一個荒原時，四面寂無一人，忽然葛思來單身迎面而來，這時候葛思來對這因細故放而曾重罰過的仇人，顯出張望的，不過長官更因此懷下了必殺他的决心。在民眾一致起來的時候，他終於為了正義，自由，選擇了這件最困難而重要的工作。無疑地，席氏在本劇中，實把這個人格象徵着瑞士民族精神——不抗不卑，執中循義。</p>
<p>在這個非常時期的中國，我相信適合於每個愛國人民誦讀而能像這樣優美，親切的東西實在還很少。更進一步說，也唯有我們這個時代的中國人，最需要，最能了解該劇中所有的含義。這裏面描寫着漢奸的心理，侵略者的猙獰面目以及他們的壓迫手段。同時，它不但指示給我們以正確的認識，鼓舞我們的勇氣，興奮我們靈魂，最後，我希望一般「不愛做奴隸」的人們，都能欣賞這本偉大的創作。</p>

<p>— 若因</p>
<p>國難的故事·施瑛·開明書店出版·定價三角五分</p>
<p>前幾天弟弟從學校裏寫信來，要我給他選購幾本關於史·地方面的補充讀物。昨天下午，我就趁着空閒去買了一册開明書店新近出版的「國難的故事」來，打算就寄給弟弟。晚上臨寢時，在枕上倚着，把這書隨便翻翻，想不到一開卷，作者對於自己國家的眞誠和熱烈的情感，明白淺顯的文筆，竟把我的注意攝住了，使我心不自主的將這本小小的書，在三小時之內一口氣讀完。讀完以後，更使我發生了極大的感慨。最使我忘不了的是下面這幾段文字：</p>
<p>「…中國辦外交的飯桶官員，一心害怕，自然有求必應。結果，單是紙張上的條約，中國就喫了大虧。不過那時候的中國人，因為才和外國接觸，還不曾忘記自己的地位，究竟還不甘願伏伏貼貼地做別國的奴才。不比那些不知人間有羞恥事的漢奸們，對待外國人一味恭敬，比叭兒狗伺候他的主人還要小心。…」——第三講「外國兵第一次打到京城」。</p>
<p>「中國的官廳和武器雖然沒用，可是外國軍隊要打到國都，却也不像心裏所想的那樣容易。可惜聯軍打天津，北京的時候，只有北方幾支中國兵抵敵，大部分的軍隊正在南方打太平天國，忙着殺自己飢餓的兄弟，對於外國軍隊攻打北方來不及救援：所以英法聯軍就容易地北進了。——同上</p>
<p>作者所描寫的原是七八十年前的情形，但這樣的情形在我國，只限於七八十年前頭嗎？</p>
<p>「日本在中國東方的海裏，淸澈的海波四面圍繞着她；扇形的富士山，燦爛的櫻花，處處顯出她自然風景的淸麗。所以在中國古時把日本當作蓬萊島，以為那裏住着長生不老的仙人，還有痴心的皇帝，派了使者到那裏去訪神仙，神仙的長生藥不曾尋來，日本的文化到多半由中國傳去的。……近來歐美列强到東方來，强迫東方各國開大門讓她們做生意，日本也和中國一樣不歡迎她們，但因武力比不上她們，大門終於被她們打開，…被迫與她們訂結了許多不平等條約。可是到一八六七年明治天皇即位以後，努力模仿歐美列强的辦法，變法維新，工商業一天天發達起來，國勢也一天天强盛起來。……」——第六講「琉球做了贄見禮」。</p>
<p>日本在過去曾與我國一般，同樣受着「歐美列强」的侵凌，可是她却能變法自强，非但不再受別人欺侮，反而來欺侮我國，眞使我們有點慚愧呢！</p>
<p>「英國人誇口說：『在太陽照得到的地方，都飄揚着英國的國旗。』我們中國人也可以照樣說：『在太陽光照得到的地方，都有中國人的足跡。』但是我們中國，不能多作誇口的事情。別國人到外國去了，…帶着搶殖民地的使命，…有本國的政府做保鑣。…華僑大都是國裏飢餓的弟兄，在國內存身不住，只好飄洋過海，去找一口苦飯吃。中國對於華僑當然常常受他們的虐殺和驅逐。一個南洋的華僑，曾經含淚說：『我們在外國的地位比狗都不如，狗還可以啃主人丟下的肉骨呢！』…其實我們應該這樣說：『在太陽光照得到的地方，都有華僑的血淚和白骨。』」——第十七講「我們只有滾蛋的份兒嗎？」</p>
<p>我們的國家不爭氣，害我們在海外的同胞過着「非人」的生活，自然使我們痛心。其實像目前的情形，如果我們不再努力救亡圖存，整個民族都將淪陷到奴隸的境地裏去了。</p>
<p>「無論誰見了中國如今的情形，都要搖頭嘆氣，可是我希望我的讀者不如此。有人想，這百年來的國難都是中國自己不爭氣，不應該在鴉片戰爭時讓列强轟開大門；就算轟開大門也應該及早覺悟，和日本一樣走上自强之路。…中國有些地方不爭氣是的確的，有些中國人太混帳也是事實。然而中國的老百姓並不比別國壞，我們不必太年輕自己；世界上沒有一個民族是生來只配做奴才坯子的。看看中國人在南洋帬島的功勞，中國人眞是頂勤苦，頂溫柔，頂偉大的民族。…但是如果自己不再起來，國裏飢餓的弟兄再自己打得頭破血流，不想到沒飯吃的原因是列强的緣故，那末中國眞沒有希望了。」——第二十講：「瓜分？獨吞？還是復興？」</p>
<p>「中國醒來了！快要餓死或奴才的中國人醒來了！過去種種的國難，是喚醒我們的警鐘。我們要復興，…我們要從餓死和奴才的命運裏掙扎出來。只有一個法子，就是聯合四萬萬的老百姓，用自己的血肉打倒列强。我們飢餓的弟兄，快不要自己殘殺自己，敎我們挨餓的是近百年來步步逼近我們的列强。打倒了列强，大家繼有飯吃。」——同上。</p>
<p>作者的結論自然也是對的，不過就眼前的情勢來說，我們對於列强，尤其要注意到我們最兇狠的敵人，充分利用其他列强間的矛盾，來打擊最兇狠的敵人。</p>
<h3 id="c195">外人眼中的中國 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 斯西</p>
<p>聽說外國人常把中國看做是一個「謎」的國家，這不是無因的，中國地方大，人口多，社會組織複雜錯綜，不要說外人不易澈底瞭解，就是我們本國人，也沒大弄得淸楚，尤其是對於民眾的思想方面，法西斯論者常把它看做易於制服的奴隸，陰謀家常把它看做易於煽動的烈火，悲觀者常說它已是扒出爐外的死灰，樂觀者又說它將是暴雨後的赤日。各有各的意見，各有各的理由，但是這些理由往往都沒有什麽可靠的根據。因為他們的論斷，只有依着自己的目的而發，根本沒有從實際上去體騐。</p>
<p>但是說也奇怪，中國有許多的「謎」，往往須要自以為不大明瞭的外國人來道破，如荒山中礦產的發現，古墓中寳物的掘獲，……等。</p>
<p>不但如此，並且從最近我讀到的「一個日本人的中國觀」（日本內山完造著，尤炳圻譯，開明書店出版，三角五分）裏，看見一位外國人——著者——道破許多我國更重要的謎——「民情的謎」。</p>
<p>老實說，日本人的研究中國，的確已到了很深的地步，就拿他們診斷我國的「大人物」都害「恐日病」這一點來說，也已足夠我們佩服的了。但對於「民情」能有這本書這樣深刻的描繪，似乎還是第一次。</p>
<p>本書最大的特點就是：本書著者不像別的日本人那樣存着私心惡意來研究中國，而是用一種「取其長，捨其短」的目的來研究的，但也惟其如此，他的觀察繼有出乎意外的深刻的地方，他能從人家以為「野蠻」的一面，看出道地的「文明」來，人家以為「文明」的一面，看出十足的「野蠻」來。他的眼光直射入中國老百姓的心底，他所下的診斷，决不像其他類似的書籍一般，只從浮面來揣摩，這就是他的獨到的地方。也是在其他日本人研究中國的書中，創了一個新例的原因。</p>
<p>全書共收散文三十二篇，試把這些文字一一分析起來，使我們不得不佩服著者觀察的獨到的，可以很明顯的指出下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，他指出了中國民眾同情分期階級的思想的流露。</p>
<p>自從淸末以來，我國民眾因為屢受天災人禍，外侮，內患的侵逼，和漢奸土劣的擾亂，使千百年來祖宗辛辛苦苦傳下來的產業，已將到了「吃盡當光」的地步，除了少數的資本家外，幾乎人人都是窮光旦；歐美一個最普通的人家，家產至少可以萬計，但在中國，試問百個之中，找得出幾個有上萬家產的人來？大多數的人都已窮得「今天不知明天事」，為了一人失業，以至全家服毒的事已經不足為奇。因此，大家便不知不覺都暗自養成了「和衷共濟」的觀念，來互相維持。於是把貧者的不幸看做將來自己的不幸，用救濟他人來做將來人家救濟自己的張本。這種現象，眞是國人在千辛萬苦中賺得來的好結果。但一向不大有人說起，有之，也以本書始了。</p>
<p>書中「零買較賤」一篇，說商店中的店員不知不覺中存有一種「多了買不起的人，一定是貧者，」應該把貨物「多給一些」的心理，便造成了零買較賤的原則。「因人定價」，說小店員做生意，要看買主的貧富而論價。「剩飯」和「又一剩飯」，說包飯作的剩飯任憑呌花子搶吃的合理。「生命與權利」，用上海租界的取消棚戶的暴行，來反證非租界的中國地帶的軍民對待貧民的和善。每篇都憑著者親眼看見的情形來說明，評論，都是些很難得的記錄。</p>
<p>第二，他指出了外僑初到上海時，一件最易發生的誤會。</p>
<p>這雖然只有「一樣習慣」一穬，但它的價値實在很大。裏面說的是一般初到上海的日本人，因為一則言語不通，二則聽說上海的黃包車夫都是壞旦的緣故，一坐上黃包車，便小心防備起來，偶然黃包車穿過一條黑暗的弄堂，或走到冷寂的地方時，立刻以為車夫要實行搶掠了，一種先下手為强的心理，催他動起武來，結果就發生了一塲惡鬥。可憐黃包車夫，不但沒有拿到半個血汁錢，反而受了一身傷，甚至丟了命。記得半月前上海報上不是還登過一個英國人打死一個黃包車夫的新聞嗎？據英人自己的口供，推其原因還是在此。著者現把這般乘客心理詳細解剖，替一般無辜的黃包車夫訴了一個大寃，眞是値得我們感佩的。</p>
<p>第三，他品評中國風俗人情之適當。</p>
<p>這也許是作者作本書的最大的目的了。「幫之一種」中，說國人對於「幫」的觀念的密切，如「寗波幫」「廣東幫」等。「三樣根性」，說中國人辦事的不肯認眞。「便茶」，說中國人理智的眞純。「互相扶助之宴會」，說中國人對付婚喪壽慶的費用，方法之妙。「有限公司不能贏利之話」說得很確切：</p>
<p>「…一所公司才成立，則各董事無一不將其私人的家庭親戚有關係者拉入公司，使吃公司的飯了。…日本的公司，卽令尤親戚朋友任職，也自有其任職的必要，加入公司之後，各有各的職司，…支那則不然，…每天祗是衝衝烟捲，拿拿乾薪罷了。」</p>
<p>這種情形，著者稱之為「吃倒主義」，可說幽默之至。「徹底的實際生活」，暗示中國人事事愛打算盤。」「某日之交易談話」，說中國官塲的架子。「支那人個人主義乎」，說中國人的耐性。「賭博之槪念」，說中日賭博者心理的不同。「洋紗之話」「天井之話」「不全力傾注必敗」，都是著者研究中國商人主顧等心理的心得。「偷與落」，說「揩油」。其他如「福祿壽」「綁票」「天無絕人之路」「口言謝則失其親切」「勞資協調」「針尖和拳頭」…等，對們中國風俗人情都有趣味的觀察，適當的診斷，因篇幅關係，只好請讀者自己去品味了。</p>
<p>誠如序文中魯迅先生所說，本書也有一個劣點：「有多說中國的優點的傾向」，但有些地方，我們正可以反過來看，自己來發覺自己的劣點。</p>
<p>至於他的觀察，當然也不能處處十分入微，有幾個地方，他還沒有摸到最深奧的境地。如「互相扶助之宴會」中，說：</p>
<p>「支那人以結婚式而使半生破產，以葬式而使其餘的半生總破產這樣的話，實太遠於事實了。…」</p>
<p>他的理由以為每次宴會的禮金的收入，可與支出相抵而有餘，除了少數的有產者外，「大多數」是如此的。其實不對，倒是愈是有產者，禮金愈是收入得多。愈是窮光旦，愈是要捨本，這是誰都知道的，因為有產者的親友當然比無產者多，其中拍馬，捧脚的還不算。不見「新生活」之前，有些「要人」還要故意造些喜慶來賺錢嗎？</p>
<p>但無論如何，本書總是一本開天荒之作，值得國人一讀的，它是第一本深入我國民間之作。我們研究日本，只知研究牠的歷史，文字，却忽略了他們的民間，和他們在本書以前，研究我國一樣。現在讀了本書，我們自己也應該努力些了！</p>
<h3 id="c196">人人應具的常識 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 箴四</p>
<p>最近，有一位朋友寫信來吿訴我，說是他的家鄉出了兩件人命的事情，一件是婆婆媳婦門口，媳婦被婆婆打了兩下耳光，於是媳婦背人吃了兩盒紅頭火柴。待到毒發的時候，正在夜半，想要送醫院去求治，因為醫院在城裏，距離有十多里路，而且又是在月黑的深夜，弄得大家束手無策，結果是送掉了一條性命。還有一件是一個人吃醉了酒，掉在河中，經人立刻救起來，但已吃了不少水，呼吸停止了。鄉下人是不知道什麽人工呼吸的，結果，由他，自然又是送掉了一條性命。</p>
<p>我的朋友為了這兩件人命事情，就感到了個人應該具有一種普通的救急常識。他因此寫信給我，要我替他買兩本書，以便自行閱讀研究，以便在鄉下再遇到這類事時可以設法應用。他說，救人一命，勝造七級浮屠，無論如何，總得替他買幾本書才好。我是不懂醫學知識的人，他來要我買這類救急的書，眞是「問道於盲」了。恰好有一位同事來我寓所，我就把這封信給他閱看，他就替我代介紹了開明書店出版的　壽白著的「大眾醫學救急篇」及黃子方等合編的「救急病創常識」兩書。當時我很快慰，立刻把這兩本書買了回來。</p>
<p>書買來了，自然，我應該享受閱讀的優先權。我讀了一下，覺得這種普通的醫學常識，都是個個人應該具有的。過去，我有一種錯誤的觀念，以為救急的醫學常識，住在鄉間而離開醫院較遠的人才應當具備，像我住在都市上的人，都市中醫院很多，似乎不必需要的。現在知道不對，因為一種知識，具備着綜是不吃虧的，况且所謂救急，是很「急」的，卽使近邊有着醫院，急急把病人送去，終覺遲緩一些；更因自己缺少這種知識，一時手忙脚亂，反要誤事，倒不如自己備此常識，可以自救者自救，自救而做不到者，可以布置妥當，不生意外，而自己也不致手忙脚亂了。我想像我有這過去的錯誤觀念的人一定很多，因此我寫出了這一段來。</p>
<p>現在我再來談談這兩本書的內容：這兩本書，內容是一樣的，不過「救急病創常識」，記述簡單些，小小的可以藏入衣袋中的小本了了，可以隨身携帶的。「大眾醫學救急篇」，著者是一位上海極有名的醫生，文字十分通俗，記述十分扼要，內分四章：第一章是救急的處置，從救急的要訣說到各種疾病創傷的救急方法，共分了十六節。第二章是傳染病和消毒法，內分三節，說明傳染病的種類，侵入人體的門戶，發病的狀况，豫防的方法等，以及各種消毒的方法。第三章是家庭應備的藥品，內分五節，說述藥品的用量以及配製法和小兒的藥量，主要的藥品等。第四章是家庭應備的醫學器械，內分十一節，詳述一切簡單而又是家庭不可少的醫學器械。</p>
<p>現在是冬天了，天氣一冷，有許多人要生火取暖。然而，不當心就要中煤毒而死的。地質學大家丁在君先生，就是中煤毒而死的。經濟學博士馬寅初，據說去年曾中煤毒，因為自己覺得，急行設法救治，才算免受閻王的邀請。四年前我在德州及北平，曾經中過兩次煤毒，嘔吐了不少的血，終算救得快才算不送性命。大家為自己而同時為救別人，我覺得這種救急知識是個人應該具有的一種知識呢！</p>

<p>— 者風</p>
<p>—讀「文心」後—</p>
<p>我底初中生活，雖然早已成了昨日的春夢，和牠日益遠離了。但近中又使我認識了幾位中學生朋友，雖然從沒有見過面，可是他們的面貌，他們的性格，却都是異常熟悉了。</p>
<p>周樂華是一個很健康的靑年。</p>
<p>張大文是一個沒有父親的孩子。</p>
<p>朱志靑口齒很淸楚。</p>
<p>胡復初是一個胖胖的傢伙。</p>
<p>杜振宇平日不大說話。</p>
<p>他們都是富於情感的靑年，求知慾極高，感受性極銳敏。我自從和他們相熟以後，便終日形影不離了。有時候一塊兒溫習國文講義，有時候一塊兒編輯壁報，有時候一塊錢參觀文章病院，有時候排編戲劇，有時候走訪名山，有時候開講演會，有時候開座談會，……終日的不是研究，就是討論，我們的精神，彷彿水乳般的融和在一處了。</p>
<p>實在的，我也從他們得到了不少的好處：他們待我以天眞的友誼，熱誠的心懷，使我深深地感到了人生的歡喜和人間的同情。他們更指示着我讀不用文字寫的書。</p>
<p>是的，他們給我的眞不算少，使我發生了研究的興趣，使我得到的常識和方法，比我過去三年初中所得到的還要多。因之我對他們也確實建築了極高的友誼。我曾為樂華的失學灑過同情的眼淚，曾為大文和錦華的友誼着過急。也曾為他們的高言偉論所折服，也曾為……總之，他們都是我心頭上永遠紀念着的友人。</p>
<p>我之所以能夠與這幾位友人相熟，不能不感謝我們的介紹人夏丏尊，葉聖陶兩位先生。他兩位不但使我能夠與他們相見，同時也使他們能夠認識我，能夠認識全中國——也可說是全世界——成千成萬的靑年。</p>
<p>誠如朱自淸先生在本書裏說：「丏尊聖陶寫下「文心」這本讀寫的故事，確是一種功德。」</p>
<p>所以我們——我和讀過文心的成千成萬的靑年　也應該和陳望道先生在本書所說：「我們應該謝謝丏尊聖陶兩位先生，替靑年們打算，把現在最進步的智識都苦心孤詣地收集了起來，又平易地寫了出來，使我們靑年也有機會接近它。」</p>

<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>節季雖已到了殘秋，南國的島上依然浮動着熱的浪潮。碼頭上有赤膊的苦力，海濱有游泳的男女，一切都和夏天沒有兩樣。這呌我回憶起以往在塞北時所度過的深秋，無時無刻不被風暴和寒冷侵凌着—此刻我應該感謝這島上的大自然，它給了我這流浪者以無限的恩惠。溫暖的陽光啊—願、永遠的伴着我生活下去，讓那兇殘的冬天沒有向我進攻的機會。</p>
<p>來到香港快兩個月的辰光了—伯明因不服水土，不斷的發瘧疾—我倆都是窮途潦倒，請不起醫生，祗有任着病長下去—然而最近一星期來，他漸漸的好起來，於是我便帶他出門遊山玩水，使他早些恢復康健。</p>
<p>昨天我們逛了「摩星嶺」，今兒打算拿整天的時間逛九龍。伯明說，他多日沒洗海操，到九龍一定得去「荔枝角游泳，逛「尖沙咀」。</p>
<p>一淸早起來，就到碼頭乘輪渡，每個人化三個仙便可到對面九龍。</p>
<p>港外歸來的漁船，魚羣似的聚集到港內，曦微的晨光，在帆蓬上照着，海面是平靜的。一刻鐘後，我們移步於九龍市上了。</p>
<p>在街市的盡頭我們發現了「尖沙咀」這長形的郊野。「尖沙嘴」一邊臨海，另一邊伸展在紅磡那邊去。牠的背則緊貼着洋房和馬路。這裏說牠荒僻是不成，可也不能算做熱鬧地方，在此散步是再好沒有的。</p>
<p>漫野的靑草，浴沐着醉入的陽光，牠的顏色比海水更鮮美，更可愛，不過牠沒有春天時的嬌嫩，夏季的葱茂那樣有生氣—此時冷露疑綴在牠身上，很明顯地這不是滋潤牠的仙露，而是來摧殘牠的生命的禍水了。綠樹的枝條活潑的搖動着，海面也掀着微波在發笑。空氣是淸新的，我們感到精神是那麽愉快！要不是草地上有露水，我們一定在上邊打滾。</p>
<p>我們挽着手向海邊走去。出奇—我在香港西沙埔熟識的那個老漁夫，又在這裏出現了。我愉快的上前跟他打招呼··</p>
<p>——老伯！今早怎麽到這兒來啦？</p>
<p>——我們沒有一定呀！那裏有魚往那兒去。你們兩位這早就來玩？</p>
<p>他在理魚網，船動搖着，魚筐空着半截子，看他的神情，大槪是魚不上網。</p>
<p>這老頭兒是個瘦小的個子，臉上的顴骨特異的突高，使兩頰下陷，額上鋪着幾條深歷風塵的皺紋。他的生活雖然非常窮苦，但他的態度看來却很安閒，很少有愁容表露，老是仁慈而和靄的幹看他的工作。海是他生活的泉源，他的慾望，他的理想，所有都寄托於海，這無涯際的海！</p>
<p>最初，我認識他是在西沙埔，我天天到那兒去洗操，因而有許多機會接觸了他。在這南國的島上除了同行者伯明，他——可愛的老漁人——成爲最喜歡接近的一個人了。他給我叙述他一生的經騐和同生活奮鬥的歷史，還有不少離奇古怪的事跡，甚至連他的不可告人的秘密也坦白的告訴了我。使我感動得幾乎流淚。他和我們同是被侮辱與被損害的，然而他所受的苦痛和壓逼比我們史深一層，他比我們更明白生活是怎麽艱苦！</p>
<p>老人忙着打魚，我們不便來打擾他，於是走開。我們並不忍離開這草地想痛快的玩個够再走。沒一歇見工夫，一陣整齊的步履聲傳來，看去是到這裏來演習的「印度兵」。</p>
<p>演習者全是「印度兵」，他們牛一般的雄糾糾，精神飽滿，彷彿要上戰塲殺敵似的。沉重的脚步，隨着長官的口令奔來奔去。一會兒演習野戰，一會兒演習馬隊換，一會兒又演習實彈射擊！指揮官——那威的白種人！喊着各種口令，把他們分做兩隊，各據一方，然後再照着指揮的號令兩下互相攻擊。「印度兵」們臉上一絲表情也看不出，簡直像一部機器在轉動。肩上的步鎗裝了明</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>晃晃的刺刀］亮光威迫着太陽，威迫着郊野，威迫着這殖民地。</p>
<p>心頭給一種重量壓覆着，呼吸幾乎要窒息。我倆靜默着，靜默着看完他們的演習，才像解脫了枷銷似的恢復了呼吸常態。啊！那些印度兵」，他們從殖民地被驅役到殖民地，從自己的士地上被驅役到別地來帮助自己的敵人壓迫殖民地的奴隸，他們身上的血痕還沒長好，却又隨着壓迫者來屠殺弱小民族！</p>
<p>火車的吼聲衝破了淸寂的太空，英吉利軍艦巔的旗幟飄揚着，「印度兵」各整着步武離開了，我倆也開始往「荔枝角」去。</p>

<p>昨夜的天氣着實冷得可以，我們躺在稻草上也像在冰面上樣，一陣一陣的冷氣直往骨子里鑽進去，使得我不能合眼，只是聽着那沉重的嘆息和低微的哭泣傷心。孩子噪着饑餓，噪着寒冷，妻懷戀着老家，不忘記那三十多頭帶了胎的母羊··她希望戰事馬上平靜，好回到自已那溫暖的家里去。可是當想到自己的老家已給砲火吞噬了的時候，心里却感到了說不出的悲痛！</p>
<p>天漸漸地亮了，那白光溜到屋子里，使大殿里的一切都顯得十分淸晰，我看到那座積滿塵埃的神龕上，正有一隻蜘蛛在角落里打着網，於是一個從此無家可歸的意識，便從心底深處爬了起來一橫七豎八地躺在地下稻草上的難民一們，已經一個個的坐起來了，一股溫煞一的氣息也很難聞的隨着在室里醞釀，但一是那沉重的嘆息和低泣的哭聲，又充塞一了整個屋子。他們不曾忘記了肚子的饑餓，不曾忘記了給大砲炸彈吞沒了的家。可是大家還在担心着，這大砲和炸彈不要有一天會蔓延到這兒來。</p>
<p>孩子醒了，他一睜開眼就嚷着要吃，可是這時什麽都沒有，呌我拿點什麽東西給他吃呢？妻也痛苦地坐了起來，拍着他，用盡了各種方法哄騙着，但是沒有用。我瞧着妻的神氣有些不對，伸手在她額上試了一下，燙得像一隻火爐，我連忙縮回了手，輕輕地說··</p>
<p>「你害病了！」</p>
<p>但她只是搖搖頭，用憂鬱的眼光，對我望了一回，勉强地回答了我··「不……」聲音是那麽低微。</p>
<p>雪片像烟一般地從天空中飛下來，從早晨到向午還沒有停，並且愈下愈緊，然而還不見有人送東西來充饑，每個人全捧着一個癟肚子，楞磕磕地望着那灰頹而剝蝕的墙壁出神。</p>
<p>又一批難民投到了所里來，他們也全和我們一樣地狼狽的，老的，幼的，男的，女的哭哭啼啼的也有，唉聲嘆氣的也有。</p>
<p>一間不十分大的士地祠里，擠了三四百個男女，已經無處挿足了，現在再要一批一批的擁進來，那豈不是要把這土地祠擠破了麽？但是，但是我們大家一樣都是落難的人，一樣都是想逃性命的，還有什麼歧視呢！　、發飯了，每個人得到兩個又冷又硬的乾饝饝，有幾個人搶到了手就啃，渴了就撈雪來吃，那些沒牙齒的老年人却祗有望着這些饝饝嚥涶沫子了；雖然肚子里儘咕嚕咕嚕地在呌，淸水不住地往上冒，可是咬不下去，又有什麽法子想呵！</p>
<p>我自家將兩隻乾饝饝啃完了，但是妻還是沒有吃，孩子却捧了一個饝饝在一只一口地咬，看他很吃力，好像吃不下去。</p>
<p>妻微地呻吟着，我很憂慮，憂慮她會病得爬不起來，假如……那未呌孩子怎麽辦呢？我眞不敢往下想了。</p>
<p>「你難過嗎？」我俯下頭去，吻吻她額上仍舊很熱，於是就禁不住地問了一聲。</p>
<p>一我很渴！她痙彎地對我點了一下頭。然而這兒又沒地方去找水，祗有雪可以取點來解渴，我在無可奈何中，看看妻的難過，終於去取了一握雪來，看看妻很高興地吞着，好像嚥得很有味。</p>
<p>難民接着又進來了幾批，我們擠得更緊了。</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸地罩下來，室里頓然灰黯了；外面的雪雖已停止，風却比了白天還要響得利害。屋子里沒有燈火，一片黑暗中，嘆氣，哭泣，咒咀，怨恨，不斷地在每個角落里盪樣着。</p>
<p>晚餐，照例又是兩隻又冷又硬的乾饝饝一個人。</p>
<p>可是，我的家呢，我的故鄉呢，從此以後，我們將到什麽地方去生活呵！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Endon Returns to Luoyang from Shaanxi - Reports Chiang Kai-shek's Safety to Nanjing via Telegram - Endon Meets Chiang - Chiang's Demeanor Calm - Brief Conversation Without Discussing Political Issues - Chiang Believes Zhang's Proposals Are Not Worth Considering <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Endon and Huang Renlin flew from Luoyang to Xi'an on the 14th. At 5 PM on the 15th, Endon had already flown back to Luoyang from Xi'an and immediately made a long-distance phone call to President Kong's residence, reporting to Madame Chiang Kai-shek that after arriving in Xi'an, in addition to meeting with Zhang Xueliang, Zhang had also sent a staff member to guide him to meet with Chairman Chiang. Chiang's spirit was very good, his health was also sound, and he had absolutely no pessimistic attitude. The conversation time was very short, and no political issues were mentioned at all. The internal situation in Xi'an was not very clear, and so on. Currently, Endon is still staying in Luoyang. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the people of the whole country have been very concerned about the safety of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Madame Chiang Kai-shek specifically requested the Englishman Endon to go to Xi'an to visit him. Endon arrived in Xi'an by plane from Luoyang at 12:30 PM on the 14th and immediately went with Zhang Xueliang and a translator to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. On the afternoon of the 15th, he took a plane back east. He originally planned to go directly to Nanjing, but due to heavy rain, he landed in Luoyang. He reported to Nanjing by long-distance telephone from Luoyang. It was reported that Chairman Chiang is currently residing in the residence of Division Commander Feng Qinzai, and his attitude is calm, as usual. Since the 12th, Zhang Xueliang has repeatedly visited, but Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has not spoken to him. This time Endon went to Shaanxi, and Zhang also accompanied him to pay his respects. Zhang repeatedly implored Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to adopt his proposals. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek told him that under the current circumstances, there was absolutely no room for consideration. Even if your opinions are beneficial to the entire country, you should also submit them to the central government for discussion. Endon told Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that Madame Chiang was extremely eager to come to Shaanxi to meet with him. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said that there was no need to come to Shaanxi. It is heard that Madame Chiang Kai-shek plans to stay in Nanjing temporarily. It is also heard that Endon plans to fly from Luoyang to Xi'an again on the morning of the 16th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The fact that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has still not regained his freedom is now regarded as certain here. Last night, it was rumored that Chiang is now under the protection of Yang Hucheng. After Endon took a plane from Luoyang to Xi'an, it has been more than twenty-four hours. Although it is heard that he has safely arrived in Xi'an, Endon himself has not sent a single word. Now everyone is looking forward to it. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Endon flew back to Luoyang on the 15th. In addition to reporting Chiang's safety to Madame Chiang Kai-shek by long-distance telephone, it is also heard that he sent telegrams to Kong Xiangxi, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, and Chen Lifu. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan will also send personnel to Shaanxi to persuade Zhang to escort Chairman Chiang back to the capital. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon, after people here learned the news that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is still safe, they felt extremely relieved. Mr. Pan, an Australian advisor to Chiang, returned to Luoyang from Xi'an this afternoon and immediately made a long-distance phone call to Madame Chiang Kai-shek in the capital. It is said that he had met with Chiang in person, and Chiang's health was very good, and his spirit was also quite strong. Based on the above, it can be proven that the previous rumors that Yang Hucheng had revolted and pledged allegiance to the government were actually inaccurate. According to official news here, Mr. Pan only had a brief conversation with Chiang and did not discuss politics. After Madame Chiang learned the news of her husband's safety, she was extremely gratified. The government's opinion is that the fact that Chiang is still continuing to exist safely shows that Zhang Xueliang has complete control over the extremist elements in his army.

Chairman Chiang has been traveling around in recent years, without a moment to rest, and his loyalty to the country is well known to the world. Hanqing, deeply concerned about his homeland, was momentarily motivated by emotions and took action outside the bounds, causing Chairman Chiang to be stranded in Xi'an, shocking the whole country. I am especially saddened. I am grateful for your indication that the central government has already decided on the overall plan externally and is not alarmed by the temporary incident. Your mature strategy for the country is admirable. Everything here is stable as usual. Please ease your concerns.

For more than ten years, he has been secretly planning for resisting aggression and seeking survival, working tirelessly day and night. The facts are obvious and need no further explanation. Since the unification of the country, people's hearts have become more united, and morale has become more inspired. The central government's attitude towards foreign countries has become more active, and international opinion has changed. We were saying that from national unity and concerted efforts to move forward, it is not difficult to wipe out the shame of lost territories. However, just as the Suiyuan war was in full swing, there was a sudden act of coercing the commander-in-chief, rebelling against superiors and creating chaos, and betraying the party and the country. Its crime is really billions of times greater than that of traitors and those who sell out the country. Those who are close to them are hurt, and those who are enemies are pleased. No one with a human heart would do this. Your advocacy of tolerance towards the Communists may be a deception. You should also suggest that the central government hold a meeting to discuss so that the national policy can be decided by public opinion and the steps will not be divergent. Why do you take this worst policy and give the enemy a chance to attack? Now, for your sake, the only thing to do is to immediately support Chairman Chiang and come out to save the country, then this difference in thought can still be forgiven. If you are obsessed and do not wake up, you will be ruined and discredited. It will be too late to regret it in the future." Signed: Cheng Qian, Tang Shengzhi, Zhu Peide, Yang Jie.

The original text reads: "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an, the Shaanxi Incident has shocked the whole country. Mr. Chiang bears the heavy responsibility of the country. If he is harmed, the country's cause will be regressed by at least twenty years. You should remember the national disaster and family feud, withdraw from the brink, protect Mr. Chiang from danger, and surrender to await punishment, or you may still be able to redeem yourself to the people of the country. If you are obsessed and do not wake up, your name will be deeply appreciated by the enemy, and you will forever be the sinner of the country and the nation."

<p>(Yangqu) After the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng jointly telegraphed Yan, reporting on the incident. Yan replied to Zhang and Yang by telegram on the 14th, saying: "I have carefully read both your telegrams and Mr. Zhang Hanqing's original telegram. I am extremely shocked and saddened. I have four questions to ask you: First, how will you handle the aftermath? Second, will your actions increase the strength of resistance or decrease it? Third, will you shift the civil war to a war against foreign aggression, or will you shift the war against foreign aggression to a civil war? Fourth, can you guarantee that it will not develop into an extremely tragic massacre in the country? Previously, in Luoyang, Mr. Han once said with tears that he believed that Mr. Chiang had the determination to save the country, but there were contradictions in his methods. Now, are you using the enthusiasm to save the country to carry out actions that endanger the country? I remember advising Mr. Han that today the country is in extreme danger, and disagreements will ultimately harm the country and should be pursued slowly. Disagreements are not good for the country. Now your actions are abrupt, increasing the worries of the people of the country. I am infinitely saddened for the country, for the nation, and for you. Please understand and take care of yourselves." Signed: Yan Xishan. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A reporter passed through Suiyuan and returned to Peiping. On the 14th, he visited Yan Xishan at the Suiyuan Commissioner's Office. Yan told the reporter that he was fortunate that domestic unification was taking place and the Suiyuan war was coming to a small conclusion. He did not expect to suddenly receive a telegram about the Xi'an Incident on the evening of the 12th. The shocking news was so alarming that he was even more shocked. The greatest pain in his life, apart from his father's death, was this. At this time of national crisis, it is still difficult to cope with the combined strength of the whole country. If another civil war breaks out, can it not lead to a tragic bloodshed, deepen the degree of foreign aggression, and reduce the strength against foreign countries? This is a matter of great importance to the survival of the country. He earnestly hoped that Chairman Chiang would be rescued first and that the incident would be resolved peacefully as soon as possible in order to save the country together. He had telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 14th to advise him tactfully, asking him what he intended to do about the aftermath. He said that he had stopped the civil war. Is this action promoting the civil war? He said that he was united against foreign countries. Is this preventing the war against foreign countries? There are only two paths for all countries in the world. Which path should our country take? The country and the nation should be the premise. The entire nation should stand on one line of defense. It must not be divided and disintegrated. Otherwise, in future world wars, anyone who fails will be sacrificed by our compatriots. The misery is unimaginable. In this Suiyuan war, it was very painful to see that the dead on the enemy's side were all Chinese compatriots. He bears the responsibility of defending the territory of Jin and Sui, and he is determined to fulfill his duty not to lose an inch of land. He will listen to the central government's orders for national policy. If it is beneficial to the country and the nation, he will not hesitate to make any sacrifices.

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," commented on the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China, stating that "although Zhang Xueliang claims to have anti-Japanese sentiments, under the current circumstances, such actions only benefit Japanese imperialism, which is very clear." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Star published an editorial today stating that the kidnapping of General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, in Xi'an has plunged the Far East into great turmoil. All parties are now watching Japan's secret actions with astonishment. It is a great misfortune for China that General Chiang Kai-shek cannot lead the Chinese government. The newspaper praised Chiang's unification of the country and concluded that all parties must suspect that the kidnapping of Chiang was not just Zhang Xueliang's mutiny, as Chiang has always been envied by the Japanese warlords. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today criticizing the Xi'an Incident. The newspaper believes that, based on various circumstances, Zhang Xueliang's mutiny is motivated by a desire to replace Chiang as the leader of the Nanjing government, or to establish an independent government in the Northwest, like his father Zhang Zuolin in Manchuria in his youth. However, the newspaper also solemnly stated that Chiang has recently hardened his policy towards Japan to eliminate the resentment of general dissatisfaction. In short, Chiang's policy is quite logical and difficult to criticize. Chiang is concentrating his efforts on creating an efficient army, increasing national defense equipment, restoring national unity, and improving the country's economic position. Chiang is indeed the most powerful figure in China today, the most capable soldier, and the only talent for unifying the country. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">National Press Declaration on the Current Situation: Support All Domestic and Foreign Policies of the Government; Only President Chiang is the Pillar of the Nation and the Leader of the Country <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The national press is indignant at the Xi'an rebellion. On the previous two days, it initiated and published a "Joint Declaration of the National Press on the Current Situation" to express its views on the current situation. During the two days, newspapers from various places sent telegrams to express their support. As of tonight (the 15th), the newspapers that have signed their names have spread throughout the country. The domestic opinion circles, with newspapers and news agencies from all over the country unanimously linked, have issued a joint declaration, which is still a first in Chinese press history. Its expression of opinions has had a significant impact and can be imagined. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>On the fourth day that Military Affairs Commission Chairman and Executive Yuan President Chiang Kai-shek was in distress in Xi'an, the national press, with the joint signature of various newspapers, publicly expresses its common views on the current situation, hoping that all circles at home and abroad will listen attentively. First, China's current situation is one in which internal troubles and external aggression are intertwined and multiplied, and the issue of survival is at stake. In this situation, if we want to seek the independence and survival of the country, we must ensure the independent and autonomous position of everything internal and external, and gather the thoughts and talents of the people of the country to make the greatest efforts under one direction. During this period, the entire country should absolutely adhere to this unchanging attitude towards any event or problem, and should also absolutely take the survival of the nation-state as the highest basis for any doctrine or thought. Firmly adhering to this attitude, we believe that the national policy and administrative policy of the National Government in the past few years are just in line with this standard, and are indeed sufficient to guarantee the survival of our nation. The national disaster has been brewing for five years, and those who plot against us cannot harm our national life, national spirit, and material construction, but have instead made considerable progress. The reason for this is precisely because the government's position is serious and firm, and the government's policy is completely connected with public opinion. Based on the facts of the past few years, we firmly believe that if we want to maintain the life of the country and complete the revitalization of the nation, we must absolutely support the National Government and support all the government's domestic and foreign policies. All people of the country who have a sense of national and national consciousness should share our views and beliefs. The way to dedicate oneself to the country today is to exert one's strength in one's position to assist the government, consolidate order, and maintain the overall situation.</p>
<p>Second, in the past hundred years, various organizations and forces in our country have repeatedly been on the verge of collapse, and our international position has been reduced to that of a colony. In the face of numerous national disasters, the country has changed its appearance, and foreign invaders have been rampant. In this time of hardship, difficulty, and turmoil, who is it who has worked hard and loyally to establish a center of gravity for the country and to strengthen the strength of the central government? Who is it who has rectified national defense and built the people's livelihood? Who is it who has changed customs and disciplines? In other words, who is it who has enabled our 400 million compatriots to become organized from having no organization, to have a country from having no country, to save the compatriots from fire and water, and to put the people on the path to prosperity? The answer is, only President Chiang is the pillar of the nation and the leader of the country. He is entrusted with the lives of 400 million people and the master of 5,000 years of history. Who in the universe is plotting to harm this leader? Who is the common enemy of 400 million people? In our conscience, Zhang Xueliang, even if he is a villain, would not dare to harm a single hair of the leader, as it is a natural law. Today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's military power is the heart of 400 million people, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's background is the 5,000-year history of the nation. Zhang Xueliang, the rebel leader in Xi'an, is now defying the great injustices of the world. Even if he is as vicious as a jackal, his heart may still reveal a moment of conscience. Today, we are calling on the national public opinion to strictly supervise Zhang Xueliang's conscience, and we are mobilizing the historical pens of all Chinese and foreign reporters to reserve the final verdict on Zhang Xueliang's merits and demerits for thousands of years to come, urging him to restore the Chairman's freedom and safety immediately, and escort him out of the country, so that the national leader can continue to lead his work of saving the nation and revitalizing it.</p>
<p>Third, there is righteousness in heaven and earth, and there are disciplines in the country. The more difficult the times are, the more urgent the changes in the world are, and the ways to solve and deal with them should be simpler and clearer. The righteousness of heaven and earth and the disciplines of the country are the only guidelines for correcting chaos and returning to order in our national history, and they are also the only guidelines for suppressing chaos and resolving difficulties today. What is the central organization of the country today? What is the guidance system of the government? It is in the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Republic of China, and the spirit of his successors. It is also in the party that guides the government. Although the current situation is extremely complicated, the government's position must adhere to a fixed and correct attitude, respecting the history and legal system. Moreover, what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has held in the past few years to lead the whole country and maintain the upper and lower levels is to inherit the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, that is, to uphold righteousness and maintain discipline. This spirit is the life of the leader, and we should cherish this spirit as much as we cherish the life of the leader. Righteousness and evil cannot coexist, and righteousness and evil cannot stand together. We firmly believe that the national public opinion will be able to give play to its spirit and strength and be the backing of the government to suppress chaos and pacify the rebellion. We must also believe that the national public opinion and the strict formation of the people's will are sufficient to sweep away various "false and eloquent" and "seemingly right but actually wrong" claims, and to eliminate all "vacillating" and "misleading" thoughts. This is not a high-profile "or empty talk, but the natural law for pacifying chaos and determining change today. At this time of war and rapid changes, the situation is turbulent and heartbreaking. Dare to take the responsibility of public opinion, list the humble opinions, contribute to the government, and point out to the people. The enthusiasm of the patriotic people to suppress chaos and determine change will inevitably be ardent, and the will to protect the survival of the nation will inevitably be firm. With this sincerity and loyalty, and by urging the government and awakening the people, we will surely be able to overcome great difficulties and turn danger into safety. We once again sincerely pray for the safety of the leader and look forward to the return of the leader.

<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>In Bombay, we visited almost every place, we saw special shops, we saw Indians who were much thinner than the Shanghai Indian patrol, and we also saw a lot of Indian historical culture in the museum. But my understanding of India, at least for me, did not come from these sights as much as it did from the conversations and observations of the group of young Indian people who boarded the ship in Bombay to study in Europe. In the museum, what surprised me the most was Indian painting and musical instruments. I didn't remember the dates recorded on them, but anyway, in those very early times, their painting and musical instruments had already reached a considerable stage of development, and Chinese painting and music of the same period seemed to be far inferior to them. Yet, such a nation is now looked down upon by everyone, and the Chinese are also looking down on them.</p>
<p>After that group of Indian students boarded the ship, the crowd of people seeing them off on the dock seemed to be seeing us off as well, and we inadvertently waved our hands at them. The ship had set sail from Shanghai at four in the morning. The people who saw us off all went back by one or two o'clock. The Chinese students, tired from the past few days, fell asleep at that time, and when they woke up it was already seven or eight o'clock. The ship was already floating in the sea, surrounded by vastness, with no relatives in sight—so they felt infinite envy for that group of Indian students who were able to pull paper and wave to their relatives and friends who were seeing them off. Indians have more intense facial expressions than Chinese when they talk, and their emotions are more exposed than those of Chinese. The loud laughter of many young women in the crowd seeing them off seemed to be something that Chinese people didn't have. I thought at the time that it was a very meaningful thing for that group of several educated young Indians to be companions with dozens of Chinese young people on this white ship for more than ten days, and to interact with the Chinese youth with their naked emotions. Although it was not a friendly meeting of any form, at least it was a contact between two ethnic groups, and there could be some mutual understanding. But in fact, it wasn't like that!</p>
<p>Indians have many "uncivilized" (?) habits, walking on the deck in their pajamas, often squatting on the toilet with dirty feet to relieve themselves, and a certain smell in the room. At the dining table, they sometimes put used toothpicks back into the toothpick holder. All kinds of dirty and casual behavior soon made the Chinese look down on them and dislike them. Once they were disliked, they naturally didn't want to get close to them again.</p>
<p>However, I understand these bad habits of theirs. Every nation has bad habits, but the aspects they are manifested in are different. These bad habits of Indians are very common in inland China, especially in the border areas. Students in universities who have been Westernized for a long time may have shed their backward habits, but I think, in everyone's hometown, are many compatriots still living with many bad habits? Those are our elders, our brothers and sisters, do we also look down on them like this? In Europe, I am now in Paris, and I don't think they have many good habits either. For example, early in the morning, walking on a small street, residents on the third or fourth floor would beat blankets, shake bed sheets, and brush clothes over your head. Is this a matter of public virtue? I feel that public virtue is not morality, it is just a habit. Habits exist in every aspect. For example, when eating, we northerners think it is strange when we first see Cantonese eating snakes, but in fact, people who eat snakes would think it is strange not to eat snakes. When Westerners arrive in China, they scold China for all kinds of unhygienic habits; if shaking bed sheets from the window was a Chinese habit, what would Westerners say the first time they encountered it, saying that the Chinese are a nation that does not value public virtue at all! Now there is no need to say that Cantonese eating snakes is barbaric, and there is no need to look down on someone just because they have certain bad habits; naturally, we may as well bring each other to good habits. In the inland areas, I saw many Western Catholic priests wearing Chinese cloth robes, jackets, cloth shoes, and cloth socks, living with so-called all kinds of bad habits. I also know that Mr. Wu Zhihui said in his lecture that Mr. Chen Duxiu's son deserved to die, saying that he was a communist, saying that he was extremely dirty, that he didn't wash his face for several days, that he never brushed his teeth, and that he ate extremely dirty things with workers and rickshaw pullers; (Mr. Wu's eloquence, as well as the lecture records, are definitely better than mine, and the original manuscript cannot be found now, so I only remember a rough outline.) I am not a Catholic, nor am I a communist, but in addition to the love and respect for this spirit, I also consider that the real approach and understanding between two people, two classes, and two nations requires humbly and calmly overcoming these habit distances.</p>
<p>The distance between peoples is not just a matter of habits. Language and writing are also something we cannot ignore; however, language and writing are a kind of barrier, which everyone knows and cannot be crossed for a while. However, we and the Indians have already communicated through English in this regard. But because of the distance of habits, the most outstanding members of these two groups of people, during more than ten days on the same boat, most of them did not exchange a word; I think this is a very unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a distance not only between peoples, but also between people. Not counting the opposition between groups, in daily life between individuals, are we all putting on faces and maintaining insurmountable distances? - Especially in cities, neighbors of ten years may not exchange a word, people on the same streetcar every day for five years may not greet each other, and people who eat at the same table every day all year round may not say a word, making this lively world so lonely. What kind of animals are humans after all?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, when I lived in Hongkou, I met a maid leading three children to school on the streetcar every day. One was twelve years old, and the younger ones were seven or eight years old. Another boy was probably only six years old. Sometimes they came back on the same streetcar. I had been seeing them often for three or four months. One day when I was going home, those three children also got on the streetcar halfway. Maybe there was something going on at home, or there was a guest, or the maid had quit her job. Anyway, that day there was no one to accompany them. The older girl was carrying a schoolbag in one hand and leading her little brother with the other. The little girl was carrying two book bags that seemed big. After coming up, this little girl had a very hard time coming up. I helped her a little at that time. They didn't show anything, so when I was about to get off the streetcar, because I knew the alley (hutong) where her house was, which I passed every day, I said, "I'll carry your schoolbags for you." But to my surprise, the older girl stared at me and said, "What do you want to do?" And everyone on the streetcar was paying attention to me. This attention was a bit contemptuous, not saying that I was tricking her out of her schoolbag... (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e38">A Perspective on Schacht's "Territorial Expansion Theory" <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>German Minister of Economics Schacht recently gave a speech at a memorial meeting in Frankfurt, the general idea of which was that the allocation of colonies is the only way to solve the current world problems. At present, Germany does not have sufficient land to supply the necessary raw materials and food, so it cannot guarantee the safety of Germany's existence. And if Germany wants to achieve world peace, territorial expansion is also an important step. The implication is that Germany has the right to demand a redistribution from other countries because the supply of raw materials and food is insufficient. This tone is not only a full exposure of the founding spirit of Fascist Germany, but also shows that Germany's economy has reached a dead end due to the rearmament.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Germany's international credit has greatly declined since the financial crisis in 1931. Because of the heated market competition, the trade surplus has also shrunk year by year. Under such circumstances, if Germany wants to absorb huge amounts of military raw materials and food from abroad in a short period of time to complete its military preparations, it will have to create irreparable scars on its finances. The facts show that Germany's gold reserves and foreign exchange each had 804 million and 114 million marks at the beginning of 1933, but at the end of October, the total gold reserves and foreign exchange were only 70 million marks. Although there has been a trade surplus of about 600 million marks in the past three and a half years, Germany has also used "exchange agreements" to purchase goods from various countries on credit. These raw materials and food purchased on credit are stipulated in the contract that the payment will only be made after a long period of time after import. Therefore, the foreign currency exchanged for German exports has to be mostly used to repay old debts. In other words, most of the military preparations that Germany has completed so far still have to rely on the continued production and export of industrial products in the future to repay its costs.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that Germany's rearmament has only increased the future external burdens of the German production sector, which is obviously a fatal blow to German finances. Germany's gold and foreign exchange have long been very empty. If the mark depreciates, it will only increase the debt. If it does not depreciate, although German debt can benefit from the debt reduction due to the currency depreciation of creditors, German goods will inevitably encounter serious setbacks in the international market due to higher prices. As a result, the military preparation plan will be shaken.</p>
<p>In the past four years, Germany's rearmament has been smooth sailing. The main reason is that countries in Southeastern Europe and Central Europe have supplied Germany with large quantities of raw materials and food. Now the situation is somewhat different. First, in the past, countries in Southeastern Europe and Central Europe were willing to lend to Germany despite the risk of funds being blocked because Germany could buy at higher prices. Now, world prices have risen uniformly, and the number of countries buying raw materials and food is increasing day by day. Countries in Southeastern Europe and Central Europe do not have to rely solely on German sales. Second, Germany's economy is becoming more and more deteriorated. The exchange agreements established between various countries and Germany are now gradually being terminated. Especially after the agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, this trend is even more obvious. Due to the above two reasons, it is certainly not as easy for Germany to continue to purchase raw materials and food in the world market in the future as it was before.</p>
<p>In short, Germany's isolation in the world economy in the future is very obvious. If she does not stop the plan to expand its military preparations, then she can only resort to war.</p>

<p>(Washington) The Japanese diplomatic community is paying very close attention to the Pan-American Peace Conference currently being held in Argentina, because what is being discussed at the conference may have a great impact on Japan's position in South America. In recent years, Japan's commerce in South America has been a major enemy of the United States, and it has greatly encouraged immigration to South America, so it is paying special attention to commerce and immigration. Experts believe that if the American countries establish a neutrality agreement, Japan will also be affected, because the US Congress has recognized that the American countries have considerable common relations with belligerent countries outside the Americas, and they will never recognize the land conquered by force. Therefore, it also has implications for Japan's Far Eastern policy. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">British Foreign Secretary Eden Speaks Out, Calls for World Peace, Armistice on Armaments to Promote Economic Cooperation, Opposes Formation of Opposing Groups, Anglo-French Mutual Assistance Should Not Be Seen as an Alliance <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech in Bradford today, calling on the world to stop the arms race and engage in economic cooperation. The main points of Eden's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>If the people of the world want to enjoy lasting peace, they must reform certain trends that are currently manipulating world politics. Today, the world's wealth is being used too much for military preparations. If countries insist on rearming, the result will be economic exhaustion. If we can abandon the arms race and engage in economic cooperation instead, then its wisdom will be beyond our reach. We British are extremely willing to see the realization of this change and are prepared to do our best to promote it. Our efforts to make the Tripartite Monetary Agreement a success are one example, because we believe that if we act according to this agreement, progress will be visible. We urge all countries to follow suit so that the international economic situation can become brighter, and there can be greater opportunities for prosperity and hope between countries, and that the living standards of the people of the world can be improved as a result. If all the difficulties in the world, an arms agreement, and a permanent solution are obtained, then we British are also willing to wholeheartedly help its success. If countries need economic or financial assistance from the United Kingdom in order to increase their military preparations, we will resolutely reject them, because the result will cause a great threat to world peace.</p>
<p>Eden then briefly outlined the general principles of British foreign policy, saying, "We will reject any dangerous doctrine of dictators who are biased towards the left and right wings. The United Kingdom's cooperation with others is not based on the form of a government, but entirely on whether it is willing to maintain peace with its neighbors and whether it can abide by treaty obligations. It must be known that when there are conflicts of opinion between countries, if treaty obligations can be respected and preparations for free negotiations can be made at any time, then international trust can be maintained permanently, and there must be considerable restrictions on the unilateral abolition of various treaties.</p>
<p>Eden also expressed his welcome to the declaration made by French Foreign Minister Delbos the other day, saying that if the United Kingdom and Belgium are invaded for no reason, the entire French army will automatically be used for the defense of the United Kingdom and Belgium, but he strongly denied that the above declaration and his own declaration in Lemington on November 20 contained the intention of concluding any special alliance or promoting an alliance policy, and said that the above two guarantees were only used to deal with the situation created after Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty and sent troops to the demilitarized zone. The British and French governments not only have no intention of establishing special measures, but are also quite willing for Germany to join in cooperation to jointly handle the affairs of the entire Europe. In short, we do not want any alliances and fortresses to exist within Europe.</p>
<p>Eden also recalled in the official statement in Lemington the degree of need for British military preparations, because there are significant British interests all over the world, and in order to give them full protection, there must be considerable military preparations. Therefore, he believes that making a clear announcement is enough to help world peace and leave no room for doubt in the minds of the world. Eden continued, "Today's world has shrunk much more than before, and because of the increasing development of science, the world is even smaller. Therefore, if there are any changes in any part of the world, our interests are in danger of being affected. We should pay close attention to it at all times and in all places, and we must not neglect it because it does not concern us. For the above reasons, I have repeatedly stated that my country's foreign policy, because the country has numerous and broad interests, must go towards broad solutions. If it is not like this, the peace and trust that we hope for will be difficult to achieve." (Reuters Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Dispute Between Turkey and France Over the Issue of Ethnic Minorities in Syria, Turkish Foreign Minister Explains His Position, French Representative Replies <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held an open meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue of Turkish ethnic minorities in the cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü stated his country's views and requested the Council to consider the following three items separately: (1) In terms of the current status of the Turkish ethnic group in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch, it is necessary to take several transitional measures. The Council should be asked to make a decision. (2) The basic points of the dispute over the Turkish ethnic group issue in the two cities. (3) A statement that the friendship between France and Turkey is profound and will not be affected by temporary disputes. Rüştü first explained the Turkish government's position from the perspective of law and economics, and then refuted France's view that this issue is a dispute between Turkey and the League of Nations. He also said that the Turkish population in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch has always accounted for the majority, so the Turkish government requested the Council to conduct an objective study of this issue in order to seek a normal and appropriate solution so that the local area can be peaceful and the rule of law can be respected. Before the dispute is resolved, the League of Nations should control the fate of the two cities and order the French troops stationed in the two cities to withdraw completely, replacing them with a small number of neutral police forces, and a special commissioner appointed by the League of Nations will command them. After Rüştü finished speaking, the French representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Viénot, immediately stood up and expressed his gratitude for Rüştü's statement on the friendship between France and Turkey, and stated that he would reply to the main points of the dispute on this issue tomorrow. The Council then appointed Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler as the rapporteur for this case at the proposal of Viénot, and scheduled to continue the meeting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow so that Viénot could attend and state France's views. (Havas Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At 11:30 this morning, the Council of the League of Nations continued to discuss the issue of Turkish ethnic minorities in the cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria. French Deputy Foreign Minister Viénot gave a speech to explain his country's views in order to reply to the claims made by Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü yesterday. He said that Syria and Lebanon are both places entrusted to France by the League of Nations. According to the League of Nations Covenant, the ruling country must be responsible for guaranteeing the territorial integrity of the entrusted territory. Although the original resolution adopted by the League of Nations can be changed, if the claims made by Turkey regarding the ethnic minorities in the above two cities are implemented, the future will definitely have the most serious impact, because the above two cities have been incorporated into the Syrian territory for fourteen years. If they are divided in the future, causing the independent sovereignty of Syria to be reduced, then the Arab ethnic group in Syria will violently resist, which can be asserted. However, France is still willing to take various measures in each of the cities to prevent border disputes or other accidents. For example, the League of Nations appointing neutral observers to inspect the area can also be accepted by France. (Havas Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The rapporteur on the issue of ethnic minorities in Syria, namely Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, recently invited representatives from France and Turkey after the Council meeting to study the transitional measures he could propose (i.e., the measures to be taken before the dispute is resolved). The representatives from France and Turkey immediately agreed to send neutral observers to each of the cities. The French representative also agreed to withdraw the reinforcements sent to Antioch when riots occurred previously, but did not agree to withdraw all the original troops stationed in each of the cities and replace them with neutral police forces, because this measure is tantamount to abandoning the rights of the ruling country. Regarding this, the Turkish representative insisted on the claims he made at the Council meeting yesterday and said that if he could not obtain satisfaction, he would give up his right to vote when the Council votes on the transitional measures. (Havas News Agency Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the dispute between France and Turkey, it is heard that international figures here have drafted a solution, one of the most notable of which is to follow the precedent of the Åland Islands after the European War and establish the same system in each of the cities. (The Åland Islands are in the Baltic Sea and belonged to Sweden before the European War. It was not until after the European War that they were changed to Finland, and their neutral status was guaranteed by various countries.) According to the current treaty between France and Syria, it is stipulated that each of the cities should be under the protection of the League of Nations and guaranteed by Syria. If a new system is adopted in the future, an additional guarantee will be added. (Havas Telegram on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov met with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu today to discuss the outstanding disputes between the two countries. Litvinov said that the Soviet Union reserves the right to express its opinion on the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement. Litvinov asked Shigemitsu to pay attention to the Soviet Union's indignation at the German-Japanese Anti-Communist Agreement, and said that when the Soviet Union decides to sign the Fisheries Agreement, he will inform the Japanese government. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet government does not seem to sign the agreement unless Japan makes major concessions. Today, Litvinov also mentioned the matter of organizing a mixed committee to survey the Russian-Manchurian border, saying that the negotiations have been delayed because the Japanese government opposes the Soviet Union's proposal. According to the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union, both parties should respect the existing border before organizing the committee, and Japan's opinion on the organization of the committee is also different from that of the Soviet Union. Litvinov said that once these differences are eliminated, the two countries will be able to proceed with everything. (Reuters Telegram on the 15th)</p>

This situation has not changed slightly to this day, and there is no reason to hope that it can be changed in the future. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>

<p>Romanian Capital Foreign Minister Antonescu set off today to visit Paris to visit the French authorities, and is expected to arrive before noon on the 16th. This is the first time Antonescu has visited France since taking office as Foreign Minister in August this year. The semi-official Romanian "Independent Newspaper" recently commented, saying, "France and Romania are working together to guarantee peace, and they are now becoming increasingly close. Paris is still the center of preventing war and opposing changes in the status quo of the territory. Seeing that the various conspiracies of the most recent times have failed, the strength and immovability of this peaceful unity have been clearly demonstrated." (Havas Telegram on the 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Anglo-Italian negotiations regarding the Mediterranean issue have already commenced, and there is talk of a gentleman's agreement being established between the two countries. According to political figures' predictions, these negotiations may not conclude before the end of the year. Both the British and Italian governments currently hope to first resolve the issue of converting the British and French legations in Addis Ababa into consulates. Discussions regarding this issue between Britain and France are progressing smoothly, and a conclusion is expected soon. It is heard that the British side is striving to avoid creating the impression that Britain intends to use the Abyssinian issue as a condition for concluding a gentleman's agreement and bargaining with Italy. Therefore, it is willing to resolve the Addis Ababa legation issue first and then proceed with negotiations with Italy regarding the Mediterranean issue. In addition, Britain also wishes to find a way to gradually ease the situation in Spain. Italy is likely to adopt a more moderate attitude towards the Spanish situation. If so, Anglo-Italian negotiations on the Mediterranean issue will proceed smoothly, it is said. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Charleston, USA President Roosevelt, having gone to South America and presided over the opening ceremony of the American Peace Conference in the capital of Argentina, returned to the country this morning at 6:45 aboard the cruiser "Indianapolis". (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has been formally re-elected today. It is generally believed that after the President returns from the capital of Argentina, he will deliver a broadcast speech to all countries of the world. A certain association and influential political figures are currently drafting an outline of the speech, awaiting the President's approval. Its content will include no more than three items: (1) universal cessation of the arms race, (2) conclusion of a general non-aggression pact, (3) discussion of the worldwide redistribution of raw materials. It is said that the so-called influential figures are the advisors who suggested the President's famous declaration on May 17, 1933. (On that day, the President issued a declaration to the authorities of the Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference, advocating joint efforts to implement disarmament and alleviate the economic panic.) Regarding this issue, American Foreign Policy Association President Professor Bull stated that Germany and other countries are currently facing difficulties, which only President Roosevelt can resolve. It is rumored that there are also dissenters regarding President Roosevelt's proposal to deliver the aforementioned speech. (Former US representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis is among them.) They believe that if the President proposes such claims under the current circumstances, it would be inappropriate and should be postponed to a later date. Britain's arms expansion plan has just been implemented and is difficult to delay. In addition, the unity of various political parties in that country, and even the front line established by Britain and France, may be affected as a result, it is said. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, both houses of Parliament received the New Emperor's Edict. Lord Cromer read it in the House of Lords, and Speaker Fitzroy read it in the House of Commons. Afterwards, both houses unanimously voted to pledge allegiance in response. The Edict stated, in brief, that upon ascending the throne amidst sorrow, he is determined to fulfill his responsibilities. He deeply believes that the British people at home and abroad will assist him with goodwill and sympathy. With God's blessing and the Queen's support, he will strive to maintain Britain's glory and enhance the people's happiness, and so on. Prime Minister Baldwin presented the response in the House of Commons, saying that the Emperor's character is very similar to that of his father, and he will certainly be able to fulfill his duties as monarch. Subsequently, Opposition Leader Attlee and Liberal Leader Sir Sinclair made speeches. Attlee's speech said that the Emperor has ample experience in the self-governing dominions and other parts of the Empire, and is familiar with social problems. The response in the House of Lords was presented by Lord Halifax, Lord Privy Seal, who said that the British Emperor is a chain of self-governing entities, and both the Emperor and the people should know the importance of unity. Labour Leader Snell and the Archbishop of Canterbury both rose to express their support for the response. The wording of the responses from both houses was the same, the gist being that both houses should pledge allegiance to the Emperor and the Queen, and that the Emperor's reign would surely protect the freedom of the country and promote the prosperity and well-being of the people, it is said. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) According to official announcements today, the British Emperor has decided to postpone the list of New Year's honors, which is usually announced on January 1st, to February 1st.

<p>Madrid The Nationalist forces recently launched offensives in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital, the town of Boadilla to the southwest, and the town of Valdemorillo to the south, but were repelled by government forces and suffered heavy losses. In the Boadilla area, the Moroccan troops belonging to the Nationalist forces and the German volunteers who recently arrived at the front to assist in the battle launched particularly fierce attacks, using aircraft and many tanks as cover. The two sides fought for five hours, and as a result, the rebel army was completely defeated, abandoning more than two hundred corpses and suffering numerous injuries. In addition, aircraft belonging to the government forces flew to the Garaitagort railroad station in the province of Aragon in the northeast and bombed it effectively. There were no battles on other fronts. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Navalcarnero (in the hands of the Nationalist forces) The weather has been bad in the Madrid area recently, and aircraft must fly at low altitudes of 300 meters to advance, so air force activity has been completely suspended. As of now, the foreign troops are the main force in the Nationalist forces fighting on the front line. These troops have been fighting for a long time and are inevitably exhausted. The Nationalist authorities here are now sending fresh troops to assist in the battle. It is estimated that the total strength of the Nationalist forces is no less than 500,000 men, of which 100,000 men are Carlist troops and volunteers. Members of the Spanish Falange mostly participate in military training in the rear, and are not as numerous as the Carlists in practice. The Nationalist authorities are gradually sending new recruits to the front lines, so there are traces of them on all fronts. In addition to those in the vicinity of Madrid, on other fronts such as Asturias in the northwest and Aragon in the northeast, the defense lines held by new recruits are often as long as 100 kilometers. Professor Newmen, an ear specialist, and another neurologist were specially summoned to the castle today to treat him. However, those who have seen the Duke feel that his complexion is very good, obviously different from before he abdicated. The Duke got up at 9 o'clock this morning, had breakfast alone, and then answered telegrams. It is said that the Duke's wedding with Mrs. Simpson will be very simple, with only a few close friends invited to attend. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Navalcarnero (in the hands of the Nationalist forces) A special report from our correspondent stated that the Nationalist forces, fearing that government forces would attack Brunete and Villaviciosa de Odón from the western suburbs of Madrid, took the initiative and launched an offensive. Although the battle area was quite small, the fighting was extremely fierce. They immediately defeated the government forces and occupied several positions. The Nationalist line to the west of Madrid was thus linked into one piece. Although the government forces used tank formations to launch fierce attacks and artillery to bombard the rear of the Nationalist forces, it was too late. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>New York Reuters wired today (16th) at 8:30 AM that the stock market in New York yesterday (14th) went up, and again this morning (15th). Most prices rose. Auto and steel stocks rose most. Chrysler, Bethlehem Steel, and US Steel stocks attracted the most attention. Wall Street was shaken by the news printed in the Wall Street Journal that the recent price increases were not related to government agents. At the same time, the market was also excited by the Supreme Court's order to rehear the case on financial assistance from the federal government for public and publicly operated power plants, which was considered to temporarily benefit utility companies. Steel activity last week has reached 79.2% of its production capacity, a new record for the year. Power plant electricity supply production was also greater than at the same time last year. There was some profit-taking in the market at 11 AM, but the general trend was upward. Railroad, utility, and metal stocks were very active. Steel was steady and firm, but oil stocks were lagging behind. Here are the prices of various securities:</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York The Reuters report on the cotton market only arrived at 2:30 AM today (16th), stating that the New York cotton market opened steady this morning (15th). The March contract opened at 12.47, up four points from yesterday's closing price, but it retreated slightly later due to hedging and profit-taking. Near 10 AM, the price was 12.44, a net increase of one point from yesterday. Liverpool cotton (15th) was stable. The price for the January contract remained unchanged at 6.76 during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Today (15th) it was quiet with a lack of interest. The May contract opened down 0.125 to 129.125, and the range of fluctuations later on was very narrow. Miscellaneous grains, however, declined due to a large number of long positions being closed.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat Opened strong because of strong foreign cables and continued purchases by Italy, and because wheat merchants were asking for higher prices. However, local demand was lost due to the firmness of the sellers, and the upward trend temporarily stopped. The price for the March contract at 1 PM this afternoon was 8 shillings and 11 pence, up 2.25 pence.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London Reuters wired at 8:30 AM today (16th) that the rubber market was firm today (15th). The transaction price for the January-March contract at 1 PM this afternoon was 9.1875 pence, up 0.125 from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>New York Because the International Rubber Restriction Committee had decided that the first quarter allocation for 1937 would be 75%, the opening prices surged, and the March contract rose sharply by 11 points on strong buying to 19.31. Later, the market retreated as long positions and profit-takers took advantage of the price increase to close positions. The price at the time of the dispatch reached 19.29, still 9 points higher than yesterday's closing price. Here are the market prices of the items:</p>

The necessary development funds for the plan total 1.5 billion yuan, and the fundraising methods are as follows: (1) The puppet organization will issue domestic and foreign bonds of 600 million yuan; (2) The South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) will invest 200 million yuan; (3) The Japanese Ministry of Civilian Affairs will invest 400 million yuan; (4) The puppet Manchurian Industrial Bank will issue bonds of 200 million yuan. The main entities for development are: (1) The puppet government and special corporations; (2) Mantetsu and its affiliated agencies; (3) Free enterprise agencies relying on Japanese private investment; (4) New enterprise agencies relying on the puppet Manchurian Industrial Bank. According to the intentions expressed by the Japanese side, Japan and the puppet state will establish a comprehensive economic system and prepare for the formation of a wartime economic system, thereby implementing a new stage of industrial policy. Given the current international pressing situation, the establishment of a so-called "Japan-puppet as one" economic system is an absolute necessity. According to the focus of the five-year plan, in terms of the structure of Japanese capitalism, it prepares the Northeast economy for the transition to a wartime system, aiming to complete Japan's sole control and national policy from the traditional role of the Northeast as a raw material supply base. Such as the iron and steel national policy, aviation national policy, fuel national policy, power control, etc. The scope of the areas expressed in this new industrial plan is as follows: (1) Increased coal production; (2) Increased pig iron production; (3) Coal liquefaction plan; (4) Hydropower generation; (5) Laying of the fourth new railway line; (6) Promotion of water management projects; (7) Development of agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry products; (8) Development of military industry; (9) Promotion of various existing industries accompanying these projects. Regarding the five-year agricultural plan, in all aspects, the Japanese intend to move away from the soybean-centered monoculture system and gradually transition to a diversified agricultural system. To clearly express the main crops targeted for increased production under this agricultural policy, such as wheat, rice, oats, barley, flax, hemp, ramie, cotton, tobacco, sugar beets, soybeans, food crops, sorghum, millet, corn, etc., reaching more than ten varieties. In the first year of the plan, the total amount of subsidies for increasing the production of these agricultural products is 3 million yuan, with the details as follows:</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Among the 3 million yuan wheat production increase subsidy, 1.2 million yuan is allocated for wheat. Considering it as a target for industrial development, and considering the relationship between North Manchuria and wheat cultivation in the current stage of Northeast agricultural production, the Japanese side states that self-sufficiency in food raw materials is an urgent task for achieving national policy.</p>
<p>Flax Cultivation</p>
<p>Flax is a new special product of the Northeast, and the Japanese regard it as promising. They plan to implement full-scale subsidies starting next year. They have already planned to purchase 540 kilograms in areas such as Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Shenyang, Haicheng, Yingkou, Gaiping, Fuxian, Xinmin, Tai'an, and Jin County. Starting next year, the flax sowing area will be 250 mu. In addition, the current cultivated area of flax is 14,000 mu. The Japanese believe that the demand for flax in the Northeast is increasing year by year, with high import volumes. Aiming to meet the needs of both Japan and the puppet state for flax, the cultivated area will be increased by 5,000 mu next year, totaling 20,000 mu. The current central company for flax production, Man-Nichi Flax Co., Ltd., will actively promote flax consignment planting.</p>
<p>Tobacco</p>
<p>The cultivation of American yellow tobacco in the Northeast has traditionally been centered in Fengcheng and has been quite developed. However, due to poor weather this year, the harvest is only 700,000 kwan, an increase of 20% compared to last year. The Japanese consider the accounting for tobacco cultivation to be quite good and plan to promote full-scale production increases in the Fengcheng area, along the Anfeng Railway line, and in various parts of the puppet Jinzhou Province starting next year, recognizing it as one of the promising industrial targets.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rice, oats, sorghum, millet, corn, etc., under the production increase plan, aim to achieve self-sufficiency for both Japan and the puppet state.</p>
<p>Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Considering the suitability of the Northeast climate and environment, the Japanese plan to establish a livestock production increase plan, maintain excellent breeding stock, and promote and improve livestock breeding, which is greatly needed by both Japan and the puppet state.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>A new stage of cotton promotion in South Manchuria has been delineated. This year, the cultivated area increased by 60% compared to the previous year, with a harvest of twice the yield. The commissioned seed cultivation area is 1,300 cho, with a total harvest of 1.73 million catties. Next year, there is an expansion plan for the commissioned seed cultivation area to 5,500 cho. Furthermore, due to the Japanese's active promotion, farmers are induced to cultivate more cotton.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese are also promoting special-purpose crops such as perilla, peanuts, and sesame seeds, shifting from a single-crop farming system to a multi-crop farming system. This shift is one of the cornerstones of the five-year industrial plan.</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: After news of the Xi'an Incident arrived in Beiping, the authorities and the diplomatic corps expressed deep concern and attention. On the 12th, the British and Japanese embassies in China both held meetings. The British side decided to await the true details of the incident, while the Japanese side happened to coincide with the inspection of troops in Tianjin by the Japanese Army Commander stationed in Tianjin, Tashiro Wan'ichiro, who remained in Beiping. Starting at 9 PM, he convened a meeting at the Japanese embassy with foreign and military personnel, as well as representatives of Japanese residents, to discuss everything until 3 AM on the 13th. They decided to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. When the highest authorities here first received the news, they only learned that 40-50 li of the western section of the Longhai Railway had been destroyed, assuming it was a mutiny. It was not until after 3 AM on the 13th that they received further news of Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, which was very surprising. They also received a telegram from He Yingqin, learning the details of the incident. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, then convened a meeting at 9 AM on the 13th at his private residence in Wuyiku Hutong, inviting military and political officials Qin Dechun, Feng Zhi'an, Shao Wenkai, Chen Jiyan, Lei Sishang, etc., to discuss everything. Jia Deyao, Tang Yulin, etc., were also present. The discussion lasted until around 11 AM, and it was decided to make efforts to maintain law and order. Furthermore, due to many rumors in Beiping after the Xi'an Incident, the Public Security Bureau issued a special order on the afternoon of the 13th, strictly prohibiting the spreading of rumors to prevent unscrupulous individuals from instigating unrest. Therefore, the situation in the streets remained as usual. It is reported that Chairman Song told visitors that he was shocked by the confinement of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and believed that in this time of national hardship, this extraordinary change was a national misfortune. He also believed that this matter was Zhang Xueliang making a huge mistake by being surrounded by the Communist Party. Chairman Song's attitude was extremely calm, and he took the protection of local security as his responsibility, implementing strict precautions. He also telegraphed Minister He Yingqin with this intention, stating that he would only follow the orders of the Central Government in all other matters.</p>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident occurred, the Hebei-Chahar authorities immediately telegraphed the mayors and officials of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar to come to Beiping to discuss everything. Feng Zhi'an, Chairman of Hebei Province, had already arrived in Beiping, and Zhang Zizhong, Mayor of Tianjin, also arrived soon after. Liu Ruming, Chairman of Chahar Province, also arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou at 7 AM on the 14th. At 10 AM, Song Zheyuan went to Nanyuan after paying respects to Duan Qirui and addressed the officers above the rank of battalion commander. Feng Zhi'an, Zhang Zizhong, Liu Ruming, Qin Dechun, Ge Dingyuan, Fu Zhankui, etc., also accompanied him. In addition to reporting the situation in their respective areas to Song, they also consulted on everything. They returned to the city around 4 PM. Feng and others returned to their posts separately within the day to earnestly maintain law and order. At 6 PM in the evening, Song telegraphed Kong Xiangxi and He Yingqin, saying, "We are shocked to hear of the situation in Shaanxi. The Communist Party harms the country and the people. To save the country, we must first suppress the Communists. Hanqing (Zhang Xueliang) has been used by the Communist bandits to instigate disturbances, which is heartbreaking to the entire nation. We should request the Central Government to quickly quell the rebellion, rescue Chairman Chiang, and implement the established policy of suppressing the Communists to maintain the foundation of the nation. Zheyuan respectfully leads his subordinates and awaits orders on the frontier. If it benefits the country, we will not hesitate. We pray that you will issue instructions at any time so that we may follow them." At the same time, he also telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, asking him to prioritize national affairs, rein in at the brink, and especially ensure the safety of Chairman Chiang. The telegram was extremely earnest. After the telegram was sent, no reply had been received as of 3 AM on the 15th. Furthermore, telegraphic communications between Beiping and Shaanxi had not been restored, so the true situation in Xi'an could not be ascertained.</p>
<p>The Beiping city area remained calm as usual. The Public Security Bureau, as a preventive measure, issued an order to strictly investigate household registrations and investigate the activities of Communist Party members from that day onwards to reassure the people. Teachers and students in various schools held meetings, and many students held separate symposiums to study and analyze the incident. School principals held a luncheon meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, attended by Li Zheng, Xu Songtao, Lu Zhiwei, Jiang Menglin, Mei Yiqi, Hu Shi, etc., who exchanged opinions on current affairs for a long time. As a result, they all believed that at a time when China's international standing was gradually increasing, the country should unite to face external challenges and should not have other problems. It was decided that the authorities of various universities would jointly telegraph Zhang Xueliang to advise him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after receiving a telegram from Minister of Education Wang Shijie, instructing them to do their best to prevent student agitation, the Beiping city authorities were immediately invited by Mayor Qin Dechun to meet with the presidents of various universities at the city government at 4:30 PM on the 14th. In addition to reporting the recent situation, he also hoped that the presidents of the various universities would assist the Beiping city authorities in maintaining order within the schools and ensuring that they remained calm and stable. The meeting ended at 5:30 PM. Regarding middle schools, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Lei Sishang, convened a meeting with the principals, hoping that the principals would do their best to control the internal affairs of the schools under the current circumstances, avoid agitation, maintain a calm spirit of attending classes in individual environments, and connect well in terms of organizations to achieve a unified effect.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Xi'an Incident occurred, shaking the entire nation. Wuhan is the hub connecting north and south and occupies an important strategic position. However, high-level military and political institutions are in a period of reorganization. Not only military and political affairs must be accelerated, but local order should also be vigorously maintained. Regarding political aspects, the highest institution is the Hubei Provincial Government. Although acting Chairman Lu Zhu is responsible for maintaining the status quo, it is unknown when the newly appointed Chairman Huang Shao-hong will arrive. All members of the Provincial Government telegraphed Huang to urge him to come. Huang was originally scheduled to travel west on the 15th, but now it has been slightly delayed due to certain matters. He is expected to arrive in Hubei by plane around the 20th to take office. As for the heads of the various departments, it is rumored that there will be changes in the Construction and Education Departments, while the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments will remain unchanged. The Secretary-General needs to be replaced as Lu Zhu has been transferred elsewhere. Regarding military aspects, the highest institution was formerly the Pacification Commissioner's Office for Hubei, now the Wuhan Field Headquarters. He Chengjun was previously ordered to close the Commissioner's Office and cease operations, while the Field Headquarters was planned to be established on New Year's Day. However, the Xi'an Incident happened to occur at a time when the Commissioner's Office had already been abolished but the Field Headquarters had not yet been organized. In order to facilitate issuing orders and responding to emergencies, He Chengjun specially advanced the establishment of the Field Headquarters to the 13th, still operating at the Commissioner's Office and borrowing the Commissioner's Office seal. He will move to Wuchang on New Year's Day. On the evening of the 12th, He convened all senior officers at the former site of the Commissioner's Office to discuss ways to consolidate law and order. The next day, he issued a martial law order in the name of the Director of the Field Headquarters. Guo Chan, the Wuhan Garrison Commander, announced his compliance that evening. On the same day, He Chengjun led 28 generals, including Xu Yuanquan, to telegraph the Central Government, expressing their sincere support for the established national policy and standing by ready for orders.</p>

<p>Due to transportation issues, coal supplies for various silk, yarn, and flour factories in the county have been scarce recently, causing panic. The county chamber of commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting permission to allocate vehicles specifically for transporting coal. Yesterday, it was learned that the coal companies in Wuxi have little coal in stock, and since the Xi'an Incident, the Longhai and coastal railways have been disrupted by military activity, making it even more difficult to transport coal, cutting off supplies. Various counties have become panicked. Fan Yulin, the director of the Qijianyan Silk Factory, made a special trip to Nanjing yesterday to report to the National Government's Construction Committee, but he has not received coal assistance.</p>

<p>Extortion Letter Demands Six Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Ya Jianzhi, who opened the Yadecheng Oil Mill next to the Jingsi Temple in Dalu Township, Jiangdu County, prospered in business and was coveted by bandits. He recently received an extortion letter, roughly stating that by the end of the tenth lunar month, six hundred silver dollars wrapped in a white towel with a red flower on top should be sent to the Jingsi Temple public cemetery, and someone would come to collect it. Otherwise, vicious and cruel measures would be taken. The 14th was already the first day of the eleventh lunar month. Jing has not reported to the authorities nor complied with the demands, stating that he is quietly awaiting developments and likely has sufficient preventive measures in place.</p>

<p>Thirteen Refugees Rescued</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter this year, pirates in the Zhejiang Sea have taken advantage of the situation and become rampant, with repeated cases of fishing boats being robbed. The Shipu Water Police received a report on the 12th that pirates were hiding fishermen refugees they had captured from the Northern Sea in Jiang'er Ao. They dispatched a team by boat to capture them that evening. When they arrived at Laolin Mountain, they encountered the pirate ship. Both sides immediately engaged in battle. As a result, the pirates were repelled. The team immediately rescued two large fishing cooperative boats and refugees, including Amu and thirteen others, in Jiang'er Ao. On the 13th, they were sent to the Shipu team headquarters and escorted by police to Shenjiamen.</p>

<p>Protecting the East Township from a Major Fire</p>
<p>Ye A'lai, a farmer from the Yejia Jingfang in Cixi's East Township, hired a farmhand. On this day, he and his wife planned to go to the Chen family for a feast. They left a fire unattended while cooking, which ignited the accumulated firewood and caused a fire. At the same time, a gas lamp in a neighbor's house suddenly exploded during their celebration, igniting the floorboards. Fires broke out in both places simultaneously, causing widespread panic. Various volunteers rushed to the rescue upon hearing the alarm, but due to the drought and lack of water, and the fire spreading east and west, they were unable to extinguish it. It was not until after three o'clock that the fire was finally put out. It is estimated that more than seventy ordinary houses were destroyed, with losses exceeding forty thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Theater Performance in Yan Yan Township Leads to Trouble</p>
<p>Thugs in Yan Yan Township, southwest of Yuyao, hired a local opera troupe, which had been performing for several days. On the 12th, the county Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched District Chief Mou and police to the village to ban the performance. However, the thugs not only disobeyed but also incited more than three hundred able-bodied men and over a thousand people watching the performance to surround and disarm the police officers, and tie them up and beat them at the team's headquarters. Township Chief Shao Zongquan did not stop them, but falsely reported a robbery to the county. After the county Public Security Bureau sent a large contingent of police officers to the village, they rescued the injured police officer and took seven farmers involved in the incident to the county. Shao Ziying, the township chief's son, led more than twenty Baozhang to petition the county, claiming that the police officers were harassing the villagers. The county magistrate, considering Ziying as the instigator of the riot, ordered his detention and dismissed the Baozhang, sending them back to their villages. The Public Security Bureau also arrested Hu Zhihong, the fourth Baozhang, and brought him to the court for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Our Country's Wrestling Master "Ape-Man" Huang Bochang Wrestles Down Miha. Miha is Incredibly Strong, Huang Repeatedly Suffers. In the Fifth Round, Miha is Lifted into the Air and Wrestled Down. <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Our country's overseas Chinese wrestling master Huang Bochang wrestled with the famous Indian wrestler Miha last night at the St. George's Dance Hall. The audience was full, making it an unprecedentedly grand wrestling competition. The ferocity and tension of the fight were unseen before. Miha was as strong as an ox, while Huang was light and agile. In the fifth round, Huang used his quick skills to lift Miha into the air, quickly spun him three times, and wrestled him down, earning applause and cheers from the entire arena, deafeningly loud. In the sixth round, although Miha tried to retaliate, he was ultimately unsuccessful, and Huang won. The Chinese and foreign audience in the entire arena unanimously congratulated Huang repeatedly. A beautiful Western woman even went on stage to kiss Huang as a gesture of respect.</p>
<p>Wrestling is India's Specialty</p>
<p>Last night's program included four boxing matches and two wrestling matches. Another wrestling match was between an Indian, Habengsi, and Anderson, also in the heavyweight class. In less than five minutes, Anderson was wrestled down by Habengsi. Anderson could no longer fight and lost. It can be seen that wrestling is a specialty of the Indian people. After a ten-minute intermission, Huang Bochang and Miha took the stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Wins by Skill</p>
<p>Miha weighs two hundred and twenty pounds, while Mr. Huang weighs two hundred and fifteen pounds. Both men have immense strength, like two tigers fighting. Even Tarzan the Ape-Man from novels would likely be no more than this. Miha relies entirely on strength, specializing in arm twists. Mr. Huang repeatedly suffered from this. Fortunately, Mr. Huang has many skills. After several struggles, he uses extremely fast methods to break free in unexpected ways. However, it is not easy for Mr. Huang to wrestle him down. However, several times he used a fierce blow to the forearm (cannot use boxing, only use the forearm to strike) and a flat kick with both feet (cannot kick with the toe), causing Miha unbearable pain.</p>
<p>No Winner in the First Four Rounds</p>
<p>The ferocity of the two men fighting was terrifying and breathtaking. Due to the difference in strength, Huang seemed to adopt a more defensive posture, making good use of skill. Every time it seemed hopeless, Mr. Huang was always able to break free and rise. The most interesting thing was that Mr. Huang used tickling to make his opponent release the hold, causing the entire arena to burst into laughter. The first four rounds were a draw, with no winner.</p>
<p>Huang Suddenly Performs a Stunning Masterpiece</p>
<p>In the fifth round, Mr. Huang launched a fierce attack as soon as he entered the arena. Miha was initially knocked down. Mr. Huang quickly rushed forward and butted him in the abdomen. In an instant, he lifted Miha above his head. The speed of his movement did not allow Miha to break free. Huang quickly turned in the middle of the stage, about half a minute, and forcefully wrestled Miha down, making him dazed and exhausted. Huang received applause and stomping from the audience, and the cheers were deafening. This method is the most difficult movement in wrestling and also the only way to win. To lift a man weighing two hundred and twenty pounds above his head and spin him three times before wrestling him down is truly difficult.</p>
<p>Miha's Retaliation Ultimately Fails</p>
<p>At the start of the sixth round, Miha tried to retaliate, repeatedly threatening Huang. He repeatedly twisted one of Huang's arms, or forcefully clamped Huang's head with both legs. Huang was finally able to break free and rise. This round ended without a winner. The match consisted of six rounds, each ten minutes long, with a one-minute break. As a result, Huang was judged the winner. The cheers from the entire arena were deafening. Countless people shook hands with Huang to congratulate him. A certain Western woman stepped forward to kiss him. Several Indian men jumped onto the stage, expressing their disagreement and challenging Huang. A Filipino then defended Huang and challenged the Indians. The referee announced that there would be another match next Saturday.</p>

<p>The first half was eighteen to twelve, resulting in forty-four to thirty. In the ordinary group, Zhongyi beat Shuizhuan by fifty-one to thirty-three.</p>
<p>Last night in the West Youth Basketball, Zhongyi beat Shuizhuan by fifty-one to thirty-three in the ordinary group, with the first half being twenty-seven to sixteen, an overwhelming lead. At nine o'clock, the Xin team played against Jinan. Although it was not a championship competition, it was a game for Chinese teams to compete. After the kickoff, Xin team's Sun Baoqing opened the scoring with a free throw. Jinan's Yong Yao Ya shot from afar to take the lead at two to one. The Xin team was very active. Sun Baoqing and Lu Zhongen both scored from opportunities under the basket, leading five to two. Jinan's Yin Guiren took two shots, taking the lead again at six to five. Feng Nianhua made one shot and one free throw, and the Xin team led by two points again. Jinan, after Cai Yanxiong tied the score at eight to eight, Xin team's Nianhua made two free throws, and Baoqing made one shot, leading again at twelve to eight. This was the Xin team's peak period. After that, they were unable to recover. Jinan then gained momentum. Wang Nanzhen and Kuang Yao Ya both scored, tying the score again. Although the Xin team called a timeout, the basketball god was not with them. They were scored on again by Jinan's Wang and Cai, and Zhenyuan made two free throws, with Jinan leading the first half at eighteen to twelve.</p>
<p>After the restart, Xu Wenkui scored once under the basket and once from afar, and Feng Nianhua added another point. The Xin team suddenly narrowed the gap to eighteen to eighteen. Jinan quickly called a timeout. The consultation on strategy was indeed a clever plan. Yong Yao Ya continuously attacked under the basket, adding four points. Feng Nianhua also briefly broke through, making it twenty-two to twenty-one, with the Xin team still two points behind. Jinan's offense was fierce. Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen penetrated three times again, scoring and returning, making it twenty-eight to twenty. The score became disparate. Although Xin team's Zhai Xilin added two points, Wang Nanzhen flicked his left hand, and Jinan still led by four goals. The Xin team quickly adjusted Ling Xianyang to the stage to replace Qu Xilin, showing some turning point. However, Feng Nianhua's one free throw and one miss only narrowed the gap to twenty-five to thirty, with no improvement. Jinan's Yin and Han then added three goals again. Cai Yanxiong added another free throw, and the score reached thirty-seven to twenty-five. The Xin team was largely doomed from here on out. Not long after, Cai Yanxiong was sent off for four fouls. Yan Lian entered as a substitute. Han Zhenyuan scored again. The Xin team was already fourteen points behind. At this time, Qu Xilin was transferred to replace Sun Baoqing, and the connection became active again. However, Jinan was now focusing on defense, making it difficult to break through. Lu Zhongen and Ling Xianyang only relied on long shots, each scoring two goals, but Jinan's Yong attacked under the basket twice again, and Yin Guiren added a penalty, so the Xin team gained more than it lost, with forty-four to twenty-nine still fifteen points apart, before long Lu Zhongen had a free shot due to Han Zhenyuan's foul, and the silver whistle sounded at this time, Jinan beat the Xin team at forty-four to thirty.</p>
<p>Tonight there will be two matches, the college group will be Shanghai vs. John, and the independent group will be Xintong vs. Mailingjia. Both teams have not suffered defeats in the league, and the victory or defeat has a great relationship with the future championship. The rescheduling game between Xintong and Mailingyi has been decided to be held tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Volleyball star Wei Dingyi and others collaborated with Fudan University, inviting famous men's and women's volleyball players in the city to hold a supporting Suiyuan volleyball performance match at the Fudan Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 3:30. Participating schools included Minli Girls' High School, Dongya Women's Physical Education, Fudan University, and individuals included famous players from Jinan, Shanghai, Daxia, and Haiqing. Everyone showed their superb skills, so the matches were performed in a tense situation. As a result, the women's team Dongya first beat Minli in three straight games, and finally the Fudan team also slightly beat the mixed team three to two. Both matches were exceptionally wonderful. Unfortunately, the performance time was during class time, so both male and female students were unable to attend. As a result, the auditorium was only half full, and because the tickets only cost four cents, the revenue was only a few dozen yuan, but accumulating little makes more, and it is not without small compensation. Finally, at the tea party, Chen Bingde stated that because the income was not much this time, he planned to invite the original team to perform again within a few days, in order to get more money, that is, to do more duty.</p>

The first Wu Chengqi and the fifth Yan Xiangguan have all played in the battle, and the good news is here. Wu won 33, and Yan won 68. The Central Youth Association has already won a majority of 101 points. Wu's opponent Nie Geer is known for being stable, but when he meets Wu, he is completely out of shape. If Wu can always be cautious, the number of wins will be so high. Wu's highest record is 29, 20, 26, 28, and Nie's is 31, 25. Yan's opponent Fu Bobusi performed mediocrely, and only got 20 points in the whole game. Yan's is not the same.

<p>Rein in on the brink of the cliff, suddenly realize, to preserve the overall situation and relieve the national crisis</p>
<p>The Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Federation held an extraordinary meeting of the Standing Committee yesterday. It was decided to send another telegram to Hanqing regarding the Xi'an Incident, requesting that he escort Generalissimo Jiang back to Beijing. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, In recent years, the people of our country have been able to bury themselves in hard work amidst internal and external troubles, making politics increasingly clear, military orders increasingly unified, financial, political, and economic foundations increasingly solid, and international status increasingly elevated. All of this is due to the leadership of Generalissimo Jiang. Moreover, the Suiyuan resistance against the enemy has been victorious in every battle, which is regarded as the result of Generalissimo Jiang's cultivation of national power and morale since the 18th and 128th Incidents. Now that the prelude to the national struggle has just begun, you have made Generalissimo Jiang, on whom the safety of the country and the rise and fall of the nation depend, lose his freedom. Wouldn't this be painful for those who are close to me and happy for those who hate me? Moreover, if you really want to avenge your father and wipe out national shame and recover lost territories, you should lie in wait under the leadership of Generalissimo Jiang, train the Northeast children into an elite division, which may be possible. Now, if you don't plan for this, but let your subordinates rebel and commit insubordination, put the country in a state of no center, and give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, then the revenge, shame, and recovery of lost territories that you advocate, how can you prevent the people of the country from doubting it? The members of our association believe that if you are determined to avenge your father, wipe out national shame, and recover lost territories, you should immediately change your plans, escort Generalissimo Jiang back to Beijing, and stop the abnormal movements, wait for the central government to deal with it, and wait for the opportunity to devote yourself to the country. I hope that you will rein in on the brink of the cliff and not fall into the enemy's poisonous plan to control China with China. Our association of three thousand colleagues dares to guarantee that after you rein in on the brink of the cliff, the central government will be able to ignore your actions and not pursue them deeply, and are willing to go to Xi'an as hostages. If the guarantee cannot be realized, all members of our association are willing to die to thank you. Relying on equipment and waiting for orders, looking forward to your moral voice, Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Federation, deleted.</p>
<h3 id="e102">More Than 10,000 College Students in the City Unanimously Support the Central Policy They All Hate Zhang Xueliang's Rebellion <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) More than 10,000 students from various universities in the city hate Zhang Xueliang's rebellion and holding the commander-in-chief. Yesterday, they telegraphed the central government to express their support for the central government's policy, to support the leader, to unite sincerely and to fight, in order for the leader to get out of danger and exercise his powers as soon as possible. There is no other idea than to continue to lead the country to resist the enemy. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To the public of the National Party Headquarters of all provinces and cities, the provincial governments, the people's organizations, the schools, and the newspapers, the text of a telegram from the Central Party Headquarters of the National Government reads: (omitted) Zhang Xueliang retreated without fighting in the four lost provinces. The government forgave his serious crime. The people of the country hoped that he would reform himself. Now, in the midst of the bloody battle in Suiyuan, when the whole country is resisting the enemy, he has rebelled against the party and the country, robbed the commander-in-chief, and is insane. He can be said to be extreme. Moreover, he advocates tolerance of the Communist Party and disrupts national policy. Try to think about the Communist Party's use of cruel class struggle as a means to turn China into red. Except for supplying sudden international policy, how can it be united and combined, how can it know patriotism, and how can it stand on the position of national interests to resist the enemy? Zhang Xueliang's actions are intentionally sabotaging unity and endangering the foundation of the country. It is truly following in Puyi's footsteps and working for imperialists. Fortunately, our central authorities have made serious decisions to deprive the rebel general of his position and maintain internal and external policies unchanged. The students of all universities in Shanghai have long been influenced by the Three Principles of the People, and vow to be warriors of the National Revolution. They love the party and the country, obey the leader, cultivate their personality, and remain unchanged. Apart from supporting the central policy, supporting the leader, uniting sincerely, and fighting to save the leader as soon as possible, there is no other idea. I respectfully report to you, and pray for your approval, Student Li Pang of Shanghai Jinan University, Student Wang Kemai of Fudan University, Student Zhong Huanxin of Daxia University, Student Liu Shuming of Guanghua University, Student Yao Jidian of Tongji University, Student Zhou Ren of Jiaotong University, Student Li Lianzhu of Datong University, Student Sha Rongcun of Soochow University, Student Ma Xiongtai of Shanghai Business School, Student Shi Maonian of Shanghai Medical College, Student Wang Zhongyao of Shanghai Franco-Chinese Institute of Technology, Student Song Enrong of Shanghai College of Politics and Law, Student Qiu Youxin of Shanghai Law School, Student Li Hanzhang of Soochow Law School, Student Ge Zhonghui of Chizhi College, Student Li Shuzhong of Zhengfeng College of Arts, Student Luo Jingbo of Tongde Medical College, Student Gun Songren of Southeast Medical College, Student Zhang Tanru of Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, Student Zai Xien of China Public School, Student Zhou Shouhai of New China Medical College, 12,141 people, deleted.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Tian Bo Lie Returns to England by Steamer and Publishes a Letter to Chinese Historians (Part 2) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In this era of specialization, this is indeed the path of proper development. Allow me to list several such international organizations and briefly describe their operations. First, there are several international scientific organizations, such as the "Union Académique Internationale" (International Union of Academies). This union is particularly useful in language-related matters and has helped to ease national jealousies. One of its organs is of particular interest to me and especially relevant to Chinese historians, namely the "International Committee of Historical Sciences". Japan is a member of this committee and is now preparing to take full advantage of its position. I am very pleased that she is a member. All countries in this committee are friendly to each other, and I hope that China will soon appear in this committee as well. China is not yet a member, and has never been one, but I hope she will become a member soon, so that in the 1936 International Congress of Historical Sciences, there will not be only one country presenting its views on the history of the Far East. On the other hand, it can certainly show that representatives of various countries can express their different views and knowledge. The Committee on Intellectual Cooperation emerged after the Great War, and all its activities began in this era. I have great faith in this committee, but I would also like to state that institutions that emerged after the war are easier to carry out than those that emerged before the war. The achievements of the International Committee of Historical Sciences are even better, because it is a pre-war institution. After the war, it not only existed, but also became the first of all pre-war international organizations to unite the former warring countries on terms of equality and friendship. They had already achieved this by 1926, while the "Union Académique Internationale" only managed to do so nine years later, in 1935. Therefore, we help to resolve national and racial jealousies. In various international cooperative undertakings, we feel that we can work together with all the countries that join. We already have forty-two countries that have joined, including Soviet Russia. China and its historians have never cooperated with us. Today, I am reading the best quarterly bibliography of English books on China, which only requires careful sorting and selection by historians to be suitable for the "International Bibliography of Historical Sciences". This publication was published from 1926 to 1934, and the 1935 issue is being prepared. Chinese historians have not yet sponsored this kind of compilation work, and the same is true for other cooperative undertakings. The journal of the International Committee of Historical Sciences publishes reports from many countries, mostly on the history of journalism and publishing, the history of calligraphy, and the historical teaching of schools and universities, as well as historical charts. China has opportunities to speak on these matters, but nothing has been heard from Chinese historians and their historical activities. This is your failure, not the fault of ignorant Western historians. We want to understand you, we give you the opportunity to publish, but we cannot find you. This is truly what is called "hungry sheep looking upwards, but not being fed". Please tell us about your historical activities, not as propagandists and politicians do, but as scholars and scientific historians do. This request is certainly not excessive. The above only describes what Chinese historians living in your country can do, as well as contributions that can be practically completed within China. In addition, there is one more thing that China can contribute: in 1938, she should send one or two famous historical scholars as representatives to Zurich, Switzerland, to participate in the discussion of Far Eastern history. I hope that both China and Japan will have representatives in this meeting. As far as I have inquired, the foundation of Chinese historical scholarship is so solid that if it is supported by its representative historical scholars, the request to join as a member state will definitely be successful. Admission requires the approval of a general meeting of more than forty countries, but if China comes knocking on the door, I don't think we will let them wait long. Chinese historians, this is your best opportunity to show yourselves! When the new country requests to join the meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, I will still be the president. If I can preside over the admission of the oldest nation in the world today—China—into our assembly of forty nations, it would be one of the most honorable moments of my life! (End)</p>

<h3 id="e110">Food: Flour and Wheat Prices Soar Unabated; Wheat Prices Stimulated by Domestic and Foreign Factors; Flour Market Transactions Very Brisk in the Later Market <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market, the prices of various months still showed a moderate trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago rose by two yuan and zero cents for the near month, and one yuan and sixty-five cents for the far month. There was no market in Canada, and Liverpool rose by three pence and zero points. Moreover, due to the continued chaos of the Shaanxi Incident, foreign wheat rose sharply again. The rise in the market was really unexpected. However, the sentiment in the market is that the rise in foreign wheat may also be due to international relations, and the outcome of the Shaanxi Incident is difficult to predict. Therefore, after the opening price, although the market was high, there was no alarming move. It is estimated that the opening price rose by five, six, or seven points for both the near and far months. However, after the second round, due to the return of large households, the sentiment turned flat, and fell by three to five points compared to the initial opening. Until the afternoon opening, transactions were very brisk, and the calmness still brought a rising trend. If the Shaanxi Incident is settled and the foreign wheat market may also return to flatness, then the market may not rise too high.</p>
<p>Wheat prices soared across all months. The sharp rise in foreign wheat was also rare in recent years. Furthermore, due to the perceived seriousness of the Shaanxi Incident, the sentiment inside and outside the industry was unanimously optimistic. The prices of each month rose by different amounts compared to the opening price of the previous day, ranging from seven cents to one jiao or five, eight, or nine points. By the afternoon opening, transactions suddenly became brisk. The spot wheat asking price also rose to nine jiao, which made the buying even stronger. The upward momentum of the far-term suddenly surged, rising by another five or six points compared to the previous market. It is estimated that the increase in one day was one jiao and three cents for the near term, and one jiao and seven to eight cents to two jiao for the far term. The spot wheat market also rose by one jiao. The opening price of Dongtai Gaoyou wheat was six yuan and nine jiao, Wuhu wheat was six yuan and eight jiao and two cents, Pukou wheat was six yuan and seven jiao and a half, and Hankou wheat was six yuan and five jiao and a half. Fuxin bought 3,000 bags, and Fufeng bought 5,000 bags.</p>

<p>In the context of the world's tense situation, the search for all kinds of oil raw materials is very strong. In recent years, foreign trade has been thriving in this area. Currently, the source of sesame is constrained by the water levels of rivers in various producing areas, making transportation difficult. Secondly, most farmers are unwilling to sell, so there is a situation of supply not meeting demand. Recently, the national grain storage is also facing a sudden change in the situation, resulting in soaring grain prices. Yesterday, fifty tons of foreign sesame were offered, which were purchased by Japanese merchants for a price of fifteen yuan, setting an unprecedented record. Spot raw hemp rose by another four jiao, and Shashi hemp rose to twelve yuan and four jiao, with 600 bags purchased by Japanese merchants. Other hemp transactions amounted to 300 to 400 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of dealers arriving in Shanghai was similar to the previous day, totaling more than 110. Sales in this street were average. Dealers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai continued to buy more than 2,000 bags of thin indica rice and thick japonica rice, which stabilized the market. The market price of thin indica rice continued to rise by five cents, and the situation was mixed. The price of thick japonica rice remained stable. The sales of Duyangjian japonica rice and Yinyuan rice became wider, rising by one or two jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 32 or 33 ships arrived from various roads downstream. The various sales routes in the market were normal, but the dealers from Tianjin and Yantai were quite active in buying thin indica rice. Spot transactions in this street were still acceptable, and the price was firm. The price of white glutinous rice was stable, and the price of Yangbu Jian rice turned slightly tighter. The prices of Baiyuan rice and other goods were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>(Indicia Rice) Yesterday, indicia rice continued to be shipped out of the Yangtze River, with machine-milled indica rice of different varieties and colors. However, due to the unsettled situation, the appetite of the dealers was weak. Stockpilers did not dare to get involved due to the arrival of two surges of rice. Although the exemption of tariffs on foreign rice in Guangdong Province and the direct transportation of Hunan rice were not yet a reality, the dealers had mostly stopped and were waiting to see. There had been no inquiries for a long time. Yesterday, 550 bags of Jiangxi broken rice and rice grits were tried out. Transportation by Henan dealers was not yet open, but there were slight inquiries yesterday. Shantou also took a small amount of Jiangxi broken rice, and North China took 500 bags of Wenshan indica rice. This street continued to buy, but the total transactions for the whole day were less than 3,000 bags. The market and sentiment were still weak.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise with strong momentum and unusually warm sentiment. Speculators were frenzied again, and there were many rumors in the market with varying opinions. At the same time, Osaka Sanpin yarn jumped wildly by six yuan this month. Spot yarn sales in the market saw some improvement from the Hunan and Sichuan dealers. As the delivery date for this month approaches, the spot inventory is probably still tight. Rumors are easy to stir up buying interest. In the afternoon, the December contract recovered to one hundred and sixty-six yuan, and the far-term also saw a new high price. At the close of the market, due to good news about the situation, the bulls came out and retreated by two or three yuan.</p>
<p>The price was rumored to fall by ten yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market in the previous market, the near-term was calm, and the far-term suddenly fell by nine jiao to one yuan and one jiao. However, after entering, the Osaka Sanpin yarn rose. In addition to the fifty yuan of this month's output, the sales of spot yarn were active, and the situation eased. The sentiment stabilized. The Hunan and Sichuan dealers became more and more active in purchasing, and the market price entered a better state. Approaching the close of the market, the shorts grabbed and covered, and the December contract jumped by three yuan, surpassing the high price of the previous day. The far-term also jumped by two or three yuan. As a result, each month rose by three jiao and two cents to four yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still tight. Because yarn sales were good, the marked price rose, and public bonds fell back. People were ambitious, and the shorts covered. In the third round, each month jumped horizontally by three to four yuan, and the far-term reached a new high again. At the close of the market, due to the improvement of the news, a decline suddenly occurred, and each month fell sharply by two to three yuan. As a result, each month rose again by one yuan and three jiao to two yuan and a half compared to the closing price in the morning.

<p>The cotton market is still firm. It is found that the rising momentum is not as strong as the yarn market, which is really due to the high price. There is a part of hedge sales. However, US and Indian cotton are rising together, so the attitude of the bulls is very strong. In the afternoon, there was a big rise following the yarn market, followed by good news, and it fell back at the close of the market.</p>

The market plate trended upward again. As a result, each month rose by three jiao to three jiao and a half compared to the closing price of the previous day. The opening in the afternoon was flat.

Domestic and foreign peers bought in. Liverpool, Wall Street, and the West bought in unison due to rising prices of various goods. There were fewer hedge sales. However, the bulls' activities ended, resulting in a part of the market price reacting. There are various discussions regarding the timing and conditions for the sale of borrowed cotton, but there is no formal news from Washington.

The current price of English cotton rose by seven points, and the futures price rose by three to six points.

<p>Optimistic Sentiment at the Opening Attracted Short Covering and Long Positions; In the Afternoon, There Were Rumors of Large Households Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market saw a sudden and drastic reaction, and the rising trend was very fierce. The environment was still extremely chaotic. However, the market's rumor was inclined to optimism due to the slowing of the war situation, and the sentiment was quite calm. Retail investors were all short covering, and large banks and speculators were also buying in, which led to a sharp rise in market prices. Looking back at the environment and prospects, there may still be repeated and uncertain phenomena. Yesterday morning, the opening was active, and the trend turned firm. Large households such as 4, 11, and 37 were all buying, and retail investors were also mostly short covering. The market price was uniformly rising by four jiao to one yuan and six jiao due to the lack of supply of goods. In the second round, the rising trend became even fiercer.

<p>The gold market initially fell yesterday due to the strengthening exchange rate, favorable rumors, and rising forward premiums. Later, due to a certain bank's limited forward premium offer and negative rumors, it rebounded sharply. In the morning, overseas silver markets in England and the United States both rose. Large traders said that after the market closed, bids would be posted with sellers requiring prices below 0.0625. Both parties reportedly had a small number of transactions. Exchange rates generally increased. London spot gold fell by one penny. The Central Bank's posted rates showed no change for both England and the United States. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.02. The standard gold bar price was posted at $1152.70. The off-exchange pre-market trading opened at $60 and change. Yu Xin Xiang, Sheng Yuan, and Yong Lai Jin rose to over one dollar in pre-market trading. After the opening, the market remained stable, but a certain bank continued to exert pressure due to forward contracts. Buyers were more cautious, leading to a sudden selling spree. Some long positions were liquidated, breaking through the $60 mark. In a split second, the price fell by over $9, largely due to optimistic rumors about the current situation. However, there were still many buyers after the price drop, and some non-professional longs added to their positions, helping to maintain the price. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) posted unchanged rates for both England and the United States. The silver equalization tax rose by one cent. There was considerable struggle in the middle of the day. Although there was a rebound after the entry of buyers, it was easy to retreat due to the hardening Hong Kong market. At noon, the market remained in a state of fluctuation. In the afternoon, due to a certain bank's forward premium offer not being as large as expected, the market gradually stabilized. Short sellers slightly covered their positions, pushing the price above $60. However, negative rumors agitated buying interest, and long positions took the opportunity to add to their positions. Short sellers continued to cover their positions. The exchange rate also softened. Although large investors supplied contracts in the middle of the day, it did not help. The market was most bullish at the close. Forward contracts were offered by sellers with premiums ranging from $2 to $3. The following is a record of today's market conditions.</p>

The domestic market squeezed again. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Da, Heng Yu, Qing Fa Yong, Yuan Tai all advanced, gradually rising to $3.80.

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was sluggish, and the situation was very chaotic. People were waiting to see how the Xi'an Incident would develop. Demand in various places was weak. Orders were being delivered as usual, keeping people busy, but new transactions were rare. The morning yarn and cotton market was stable. Cloth prices remained high despite weak actual sales. Colleagues distributed plain coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill from various Chinese and foreign factories. Spot goods were sold slightly. The market for coarse cloth and coarse twill remained unchanged. Fine cloth, fine twill, and heavy cloth fell by 0.05. Total transactions were over 200 pieces. Printed direct tribute, serge, colored tribute, and satin sold at a flat price. Spot sales were not smooth. Printing and dyeing factories were very idle. Near noon, yarn prices suddenly rebounded by $4. Bullish sentiment spread throughout the market. In the afternoon, the yarn market continued to rise, stimulating the cloth market. Selling prices suddenly increased by 0.1 to 0.15. This created a deviation from the current sluggish sales. Actual sales were not initially stimulated, but the market prices rose by 0.15, it is said.</p>

<p>White Filature Silk Slightly Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>The silk market has felt rather sluggish lately. Yesterday, the New York exchange market showed a stable surge. Various grades of silk, both nearby and from distant locations in Japan, the United States, and France, experienced slight increases or maintained their original prices. However, the prices for Japanese silk in New York and other areas showed some softening. It is estimated that daily Chinese and Guangdong silk prices were down by three to five cents compared to last Saturday. However, silk purchases by foreign firms are gradually nearing agreement. Consequently, white filature silk in Shanghai has seen slightly increased sales. Current market prices cannot be compared to the previous high prices. Recently, ordinary B-grade 20-22 denier silk, without evenness, sold for 710 yuan, which is considered relatively average. Sales of Indian firm silk gradually met demand yesterday, so transactions gradually decreased. There is still no improvement in silk for domestic use.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Mayor Wu Replied to Acting President Kong Yesterday Stating He Would Lead Shanghai Citizens to Support Central Policies <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Since Zhang Xueliang's mutiny and kidnapping of the Commander-in-Chief in Xi'an, Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, has been acting as the head of the Executive Yuan. On the 13th, he sent a telegram to the authorities of various provinces and cities, expressing his willingness to work together and strive to ensure national security in accordance with the established policies of President Chiang. Upon receiving the telegram, Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city sent a reply to Acting President Kong yesterday, stating: "Respected Acting President Kong of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, I have respectfully received your telegram. The news of the Xi'an Incident has caused immense distress and indignation. President Chiang has struggled arduously for many years with unwavering loyalty to the country. The lives of the people depend on him. National unity has already taken shape. We, who support the leader and work together for national salvation, are still afraid of falling short. Yet, a sudden change has occurred within our ranks, a most extraordinary event. The foundation of the nation is shaken, and our hearts are filled with grief. Wu Tiecheng is unworthy, but I will lead the citizens of Shanghai to unanimously support the policies of the Central Government in order to fulfill the expectations and local responsibilities. Maintaining order and stabilizing the people's hearts are the most urgent tasks. Currently, government affairs are proceeding as usual, and the local area is peaceful. Please ease your concerns and provide instructions so that we may follow them. I am filled with anticipation. Respectfully, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai. [Seal]"</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Advocates Donating New Year Savings to Support Suiyuan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice advocating for saving all expenses during the New Year and donating the savings to support Suiyuan. The notice states: "This time, the bandit-puppets have invaded Suiyuan. Our brave and loyal soldiers at the front line are fighting bloody battles in the freezing weather. Bailin Temple and Xila Mulun Temple have been successively recovered. Now, they are advancing towards Shangdu, and the good news is spreading rapidly, shaking the nation. Shanghai, being in the rear, should save unnecessary expenses as much as possible and donate generously to encourage the morale of the soldiers in this prelude to the revival of the nation. The New Year is approaching, and there is a custom of exchanging New Year gifts and sending greeting cards, which amounts to a considerable expense nationwide. At this critical time for the nation, when we are preoccupied with resisting the enemy, this annual extravagance is precisely when our people should be diligent and endure hardships, share life and death with the soldiers at the front line, and focus on relieving anxieties rather than celebrating. If we can use this unnecessary expenditure for the soldiers fighting the enemy, and if all the people share this sentiment, a substantial amount of money can be raised. The Chamber has taken up the advocacy of the insurance industry association, believing that it is essential. Therefore, we are announcing this in the newspapers, hoping that our compatriots across the country will uphold this proposition and actively promote it to achieve this great undertaking. If you agree, please deposit your savings with the banks and money shops designated by the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Rescue Committee, which is jointly formed by our chamber, etc. We anxiously await your contributions."</p>

<p>Party Headquarters of Two Railways</p>
<p>The special party headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways telegraphed the Northeastern generals yesterday, saying: Northeastern generals and all soldiers are aware that Mr. Zhang Hanqing has been used by the communists, suddenly makes reckless claims, and holds Chiang Kai-shek hostage, besieging Xi'an, which is deeply shocking. At this time of serious national crisis, with foreign aggression imminent, the enemy is embracing a scheme to use Chinese to control Chinese. If we fall for their trick, it will lead to the demise of the entire country and nation. Under a collapsing nest, where are there intact eggs? Being friends with a tiger, one will eventually be devoured. Moreover, the most important issue for China at present is to seek national freedom and revitalization. To achieve this goal, it is essential to unite sincerely throughout the country, gather all the strength of the country, and use it to defend the territory and recover lost land. At a time when foreign troubles have not yet ended, there is an even greater need for correct strategies and unified leadership. Therefore, protecting the safety of the highest leader is the duty of all soldiers and civilians in the country. Saving the Party and saving the country, we believe you sympathize. Now, Zhang Xueliang is ignorant of conscience, willingly rebels. We urge you to uphold justice together, not to fear threats, not to be deceived, and to quickly correct your mistakes and return to the Central Government, welcome President Chiang back to Beijing, and discuss the major plan to save the country. This is a sincere and painful plea, and we hope you will consider it. It would be a great fortune. The special party headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways bows with sincerity.</p>
<p>Security Party Headquarters</p>
<p>(Telegram One) To the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: Zhang Xueliang, the rebel, holds the Commander-in-Chief hostage, imprisons comrades, colludes with bandits, and resists the government. His actions of rebelling against his superiors and betraying the country are already obvious. This kind of beastly behavior sets a bad precedent unprecedented in our nation's history. China and abroad are shocked, and the people are outraged. We beg the leaders to resolve the danger and lead the nation to safety. This association respectfully leads all officers, soldiers, and comrades in swearing to be the government's backing. We humbly express our words with utmost sincerity and ceaseless prayers. Wu Tiecheng, Ji Zhangjian, and Shi Ziya, Guiding Committee Members of the Shanghai Security Corps Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, bow with sincerity. (Telegram Two) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: Eliminating bandits, removing traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the country is the consistent policy of our wise Central Government, and no one with blood and qi disagrees. Soldiers who bear heavy responsibilities should especially be inspired by loyalty and anger, obey the laws and regulations, and support the leader, in order to rectify discipline and guide the people. But alarming news has arrived that you, sir, have held the Commander-in-Chief hostage and rebelled against the government. This kind of rebellious act against superiors, betrayal of the Party, harming the country, reckless claims, and colluding with bandits is rare in modern times and has never been laughed at in ancient times. How can we forgive bandits and enable traitors? If this is allowed, then your crime, sir, is a hundred times greater than Yuan Shikai's seizure of the Republic and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier. If severe punishment is not imposed, how can we show the future and uphold righteousness? Since your rebellion, sir, the world has been shocked, and friends and enemies alike are indignant. This shows that justice exists in people's hearts, and good and evil cannot be hidden. The mountains and rivers of the Northeast have already been sacrificed at your hands. How can we bear to let the Qin Mountains and the Han Rivers feed tigers and wolves again? The devastation of Spain can serve as a warning to those who rely on foreign forces. We hope that you will protect President Chiang and all Party, military, and political leaders to a safe area, and we hope that you will quickly restore order, obey the Central Government's orders, and relinquish your arms to apologize to the people. A timely retreat is the mark of a wise man. May you choose well between merit and demerit, praise and blame. This is an urgent plea, and we hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Association Telegram</p>
<p>(Telegram One) To the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing: In recent years, foreign insults have been frequent, and the national crisis is extremely urgent. Fortunately, our President Chiang is loyal to the country and strives for self-strengthening, unifying the country and suppressing bandits. He is currently leading the army to resist the enemy, drive out the invaders, and border battles are winning victories. We hoped to launch a major offensive and restore our territory. But news came suddenly, and a great change happened. Zhang Xueliang, who previously lost the three provinces and was abandoned by the people, relied on our President Chiang's magnanimity to give him a chance for self-renewal, and even gave him an important position to observe his subsequent effects. Who knew that his beastly nature was formed, and dangerous intentions were hidden? He dared to hold the Commander-in-Chief in Xi'an at this time of national unity and popular enthusiasm, and restrained the military in the rear, shaking the foundation of the country and providing opportunities for the enemy. Tracing his intentions and his past events, can his flesh and blood still be eaten? Our association and its 36,000 postal workers, far from the great change, are filled with anger. In sadness and indignation, we beat our chests in pain. Now, we respectfully submit our feelings and telegram to the Committee, issue a notice to the whole country, denounce the rebel, and rescue our President Chiang, the only supreme leader of the nation, from danger as soon as possible. Our association is concerned about survival and vows to use our hot blood to be driven and will never refuse to go through fire and water. The National Postal Workers' General Union, together with 36,000 postal workers nationwide, bows. (Telegram Two) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: Reading the newspaper, we learned that you held President Chiang hostage and stayed in Xi'an. The news came, and we were inexplicably shocked. The foundation of the country is shaken. Our President Chiang is loyal to the country and strives for self-strengthening. All who are of the same blood swear to protect him to the death. Today, the unification of the country has been completed, and the suppression of bandits and invaders is imminent. Resisting foreign aggression, good news is frequently reported. The recovery of the three provinces is just around the corner. How exciting and joyful it should be! But in this critical moment, you were suddenly misled by heresies, daring to hold the Commander-in-Chief hostage, and willing to be a rebellious minister and traitor. It is a painful thing for loved ones and a joyous thing for enemies. What is more heartbreaking than this? Moreover, in today's matter, the communists do not really love you, sir, but merely use you as a puppet. Repaying the favor, the day for you, sir, is not far off. It will only make the national discipline disappear and destroy the strength of resistance to the enemy, giving the invaders an opportunity to invade, and plunging the nation into a state of eternal ruin. You, sir, will regret it too late. For thousands of years to come, you, sir, will be the historical sinner of the nation. Even if you, sir, are foolish, can you not calculate this? Our association is concerned about survival and dares to express our feelings sincerely. We humbly hope that you will wake up immediately, restore the Chairman's freedom, await punishment, and wait for the Central Government to deal with it. You can still redeem yourself in the eyes of the people. Otherwise, look at the country today. Those who are your enemies will be 450 million people. Even if you, sir, want a place to bury yourself, you will not be able to get it. Wisdom, virtue, foolishness, and wickedness depend on a single thought. We hope that you, sir, will choose for yourself. We ask you to consider it. It would be a great fortune. National Postal Workers' General Union, worships.</p>
<p>Journalists Association</p>
<p>Issued two telegrams as follows: (Telegram One) To the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang and the National Government in Nanjing: The Xi'an Incident has shocked the country. Zhang Xueliang, as a soldier, arbitrarily made political claims, held the Commander-in-Chief of the entire army hostage, and the work of suppressing the Red Army fell short. The soldiers on the border felt even more chilled. We earnestly hope that the Central Government will continue to adhere to the consistent policy of suppressing bandits and pacifying the interior, and quickly devise a way to quell the chaos in order to stabilize people's hearts and consolidate the foundation of the country. The Shanghai Journalists Association bows with sincerity and utmost expectation. (Telegram Two) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: The Xi'an Incident has shocked the country. You, sir, as a soldier, bear the heavy responsibility of suppressing the Red Army. At this time of foreign aggression and national crisis, how can you disregard the interests of the nation and arbitrarily make political claims? President Chiang is the leader of the entire people and the Commander-in-Chief of the entire army. He is concerned about national affairs and never rests. But now he is held hostage and loses his freedom. The people of the country are all concerned about President Chiang's safety. It is essential to prioritize the nation and the people and immediately restore President Chiang's freedom. All opinions and claims can be submitted to the Central Government through proper channels. You, sir, are still young, and there is still plenty of time to make amends. Be careful not to be deceived by others and never remain stubborn, destroying your future. We offer our humble sincerity and hope that you will consider it. The Shanghai Journalists Association bows.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<p>(Telegram One) Yesterday's telegram to Zhang Xueliang said: To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: Since the loss of the eastern provinces, many Chinese have blamed you, sir, for the policy of non-resistance. However, those who sympathize with your difficulties and hope that you will recover the lost territory and make meritorious service to atone for your sins are not uncommon. In recent years, the national crisis has become increasingly urgent. President Chiang disregarded his own safety and shouldered the heavy responsibility of reforming the people's decadent and dispirited habits and building a foundation for national prosperity and revival. The people of the whole country unanimously support him. Just as the southwest was about to be unified, the border situation became alarming again. President Chiang did not have time to warm his seat and moved to Luoyang to command the soldiers on the front lines to suppress the bandits and rebels. The north of Suiyuan has been gradually cleared, and the north of Chahar can be pacified with a gesture. The hearts of the people throughout the country are stirred. Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred in Xi'an, and President Chiang was besieged. This has shocked those who heard of it. If you, sir, take resisting foreign aggression and saving the country as your duty, you should lie on firewood and taste gall and sharpen your determination to avenge your hatred and wipe out your shame. But you did not do this and held the Commander-in-Chief hostage and violated the principles of ethics and morality. Who would believe that you can thoroughly resist the enemy? For your sake, sir, if you can turn back from your errors and restore President Chiang's freedom, so that our national revival will not be affected, then past mistakes may be forgiven by the Central Government and the people of the country. Otherwise, the whole country will rise up to condemn you, and destruction can be expected immediately. We hope that you, sir, will give this careful consideration. Looking west and eagerly awaiting good news, The Overseas Chinese Federation bows. (Telegram Two) Telegram to overseas compatriots: To the general chambers of commerce, associations, schools, newspapers, publishing houses, and all overseas compatriots: Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, our President Chiang has traveled back and forth to Xi'an to plan and coordinate, not even having time to rest. The bandits and rebels in the north of Suiyuan have been suppressed because of this. The national spirit has been inspired. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang's troops suddenly held President Chiang hostage in Xi'an. The news has caused pain and indignation to the people of the country. Our association has telegraphed to persuade Mr. Zhang to turn back from his errors and immediately escort President Chiang back to the capital. If Mr. Zhang is stubborn and does not care about public opinion, we vow to fully support the Central Government and eliminate the national traitors. We earnestly hope that overseas compatriots in all regions will persuade him. The Overseas Chinese Federation bows.</p>
<p>New Life Movement Association</p>
<p>Telegraphed to Zhang Xueliang: To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have been lost and not yet recovered. Recently, the Suiyuan War has been tense and foreign insults have been frequent. At this time of national crisis, how can we gather the wisdom and strength of the masses to think about ways to unite and resist foreign aggression? Unexpectedly, the Xi'an incident occurred the other day, and you, sir, suddenly held President Chiang hostage and made reckless claims in your telegrams. In this situation, you, sir, are taking advantage of the danger to rebel against the country. How can you speak of uniting to save the country and recover the lost territory? We have seen in the news that you, sir, have the determination to avenge your father and return to the northeast. If there is such an intention, it is even more necessary to obey the leader and support the Central Government, so that political orders are unified and we can jointly resist foreign aggression. Saving the country and surviving is the most important thing. We hope that you will wake up suddenly, repent sincerely, and immediately escort President Chiang back safely. All military and political affairs should be ordered by the Central Government and handled comprehensively. Then, knowing that you can correct your mistakes, the Central Government may be able to forgive your past. We offer our special telegram and earnestly pray that you will adopt it. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association bows.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lake Society</p>
<p>Telegraphed to Zhang Xueliang yesterday: To Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an: As the Suiyuan incident unfolds, the national crisis is urgent. To unite and save the country, is there any other way? We heard that the departments under your command have different views and actually made President Chiang trapped in a dangerous situation. We are shocked. We believe that President Chiang is the commander-in-chief of the country and is deeply and greatly concerned with the safety of the country. We still hope that you will rein in your horse at the precipice, protect the leader, and release the troops. The nation and the country depend on it. The Shanghai Lake Society Committee bows.</p>

<p>Please Donate Money, Medicine, and Supplies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the committee members yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, the bandits and rebels have invaded the border, and the war has broken out. The soldiers have been sacrificing their lives and bravely fighting the enemy. However, we are mindful that Suiyuan is inherently a harsh land, and it is now the height of winter. The disaster victims have suffered terribly, and their displacement and deaths are continuously reported, which is unbearable to hear. The various charitable organizations in Shanghai are committed to saving the people. The severity of this military disaster is particularly cruel. Therefore, we have jointly launched this association with enthusiastic supporters, vowing to fulfill our national duty, be prepared and make every effort. All measures have been announced in the newspapers, and we trust that you are aware of them. We have already sent the vice-chairman of the entire association to the disaster area to conduct on-the-ground investigations and relief efforts. We have long admired your enthusiasm for charity and your desire to benefit the people. Therefore, we are sending you a donation book with this letter, and we respectfully request that you, mindful of the urgent need for rescue by the disaster victims, generously donate as much money, winter clothing, trousers, socks, gloves, gauze, medicines, etc. as possible. Our association will immediately transport them to the disaster area for on-the-ground investigation and distribution. Saving the country must begin with saving the people, which is also self-preservation. We sincerely express our thoughts, and we humbly request your consideration.</p>

<p>In response to the Xi'an Incident, in addition to telegraphing Zhang Xueliang to rein in his horse and restore President Chiang's freedom, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is also making every effort to prevent labor unrest from occurring in order to prevent villains from taking advantage of the opportunity to act. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, it also convened representatives of various trade unions affiliated with the city to hold a discussion meeting to report on the incident and the steps that the labor circles should take. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Including the presence of Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, Shui Xiangyun, and other members of the Federation of Trade Unions, as well as representatives of more than 80 trade unions, such as the China Public Bus Ticket Seller Welfare Association, Hat Making, Ink Making, Towing, Fifth District, Match, Sixth District Water and Electricity, Brewing, Civilian Shipping, Wood Industry, Travel Industry, Auto Driver, Leather Making, Shoe Making, Newspaper Industry, Fourth District Import and Export Industry, Second District Needle and Thread, Postal Service, Ship Wood Industry, Sauce Industry First District Cosmetics, Sixth District Woodworking, First District Water and Electricity, Sixth District Tea Making, Military Uniform, Eighth District Woodworking, Fourth District Silk Reeling, Seventh District Cleaning, National District Loading and Unloading, First District Shipbuilding, Sixth District Silk Reeling, Elevator Driver, First District Woodworking, Fifth District Woodworking, Sixth District Public Bus, First District Cotton Spinning, Candle Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Rice Cake, Fifth District Carrying, Fourth District Carrying, Fourth District Cigarette Rolling, Fourth District Shipbuilding, etc., including Li Hua, Zhao Zhenhui, Wang Yuxiang, Zhang Yuanming, Zhao Sanyuan, Zhou Qigui, Zhang Shanqin, and other representatives of more than 100 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Zhu Xuefan reported on the incident, briefly stating that since the news of President Chiang's detention in Xi'an came, the whole country was shocked. At this time of national unification and the emergency of the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Xueliang actually advocated accommodating the Communists and allying with Russia, and even risked acting improperly by holding the Commander-in-Chief hostage, putting the nation and the people in danger, which is deeply painful and indignant. At this time of great change, we can only maintain a calm and solemn attitude, support President Chiang, and support the Central Government's handling of Zhang Xueliang. On the one hand, we should also assist the government and jointly maintain local security, strictly prevent labor unrest from occurring, and monitor the activities of reactionary elements and general traitors, so as to stabilize social morale and never easily believe rumors and disturb each other, etc. Finally, he shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Guangdong Bank Shanghai Branch reopened on the morning of the 15th, with Chinese and British flags prominently displayed at the entrance. Several Chinese and Western police officers from the Public Works Department provided security. The bank's Chairman, T.V. Soong, Executive Directors Wu Tiecheng, Deng Mianren, Huo Baoshu, and others arrived around 9:00 AM to preside over the reopening, though no ceremony was held. Prominent figures from various sectors in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, including Xu Kan, Ye Gongchuo, Li Shizeng, Zhao Dihua, Chen Xing, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Peishen, Chen Guangfu, Feng Gengguang, Zhang Tingfu, Lin Kanghou, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, Shen Shuyu, Zhu Runsheng, and others, visited to offer their congratulations. They were received by General Manager Zhang Rongpu and all the bank's staff, and refreshments were served on the fifth floor. Half of the bank's existing deposits were converted into shares, and the other half was issued as unsecured bonds, all of which have been distributed. New deposits received in the morning exceeded five million yuan, and the total for the afternoon is expected to reach ten million yuan. It is also reported that the bank has joined the Shanghai Bankers Association and is in negotiations to restore its membership, which is not expected to be a problem. As for the clearing house, the bank was originally the 23rd clearing bank. Since its closure, no other bank has replaced it. Due to the late notification, it was unable to resume immediately, and will temporarily entrust the Bank of Communications, Shanghai, and other banks to handle its clearing. It is expected that the procedures will be completed by the end of the month, and clearing will be resumed.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Bank Shanghai Branch opened yesterday morning. The bank's Chairman, T.V. Soong, issued a statement saying that the Guangdong Bank was the first commercial bank established in South China, with branches throughout overseas. Among the banks in South China, it has been the leading bank for many years. Unfortunately, due to the global economic downturn and the bank's improper response, it was affected and temporarily suspended operations. However, due to its strong foundation and excellent reputation, the domestic and foreign creditors supported a thorough reorganization shortly after the suspension. As a result, the bank's financial situation recovered, and a large amount of new capital was quickly raised. Many new businesses in China were founded by people from Guangdong, but the progress of these businesses requires sound financial institutions as their backing to be successful. People from Guangdong everywhere are eager for the bank to reopen soon. The Shanghai financial community also has unlimited hopes for the future development of the Guangdong economy and especially hopes that the bank will be restored in time so that there will be a bank representing the merchants and people of Guangdong to jointly develop. The Hong Kong head office and the Guangzhou branch reopened on the 23rd and 25th of last month, respectively, and have received enthusiastic support from the government and the public. The atmosphere is excellent. The Shanghai and Hankou branches opened today, and overseas branches will also reopen in the shortest possible time. Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in the country and the hub of finance. The business tasks of the Shanghai branch, assisting the businesses of the people of Guangdong, and mediating various commercial interests, should be given special attention to fulfill the bank's special mission. Chairman T.V. Soong told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that after Guangdong Bank prepared for reopening according to the negotiated plan, the Hong Kong branch first reopened on the 23rd of last month, the Guangzhou branch also reopened on the 25th of last month, and the Shanghai and Hankou branches reopened at the same time today. The overseas San Francisco and Taishan branches will also reopen on a regular basis. As for the staff of each branch, they are all people with banking experience. He also provided a copy of the negotiated plan, which is recorded as follows: Hong Kong Guangdong Bank Limited Negotiated Plan: (1) Apply to the Hong Kong High Court to revoke the liquidation of Guangdong Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as the Bank). This report was submitted by the Bank's directors on September 4, 1935. (2) The Bank's capital of 8,665,600 yuan (divided into 216,640 shares, each with a face value of 40 yuan, fully paid up, referred to as ordinary shares in this plan) will be reduced to 1,083,200 yuan, divided into 116,640 shares, each with a face value of 5 yuan. This method of reducing share capital is to deduct the amount of losses or assets that cannot be represented from the fully paid-up share capital, that is, to reduce the previous 216,640 shares by 35 yuan per share, and to reduce the nominal value of all the Bank's ordinary shares from 40 yuan to 5 yuan per share. (3) Authorize the Bank to issue the following types of shares to increase the Bank's capital: (A) 200,000 shares with a fully paid-up value of 10 yuan per share. This type of share is called the first preferred share and has the right to a fixed cumulative preferred dividend, calculated at an annual interest rate of 8% on the fully paid-up share capital. It is paid first from the annual profits, and its share capital rank is higher than all other types of shares. (B) Second preferred shares of 10 yuan per share, which are subscribed by the Bank's unsecured creditors. In the future, the Bank will provide shares of equal value to each creditor at half the value of their debt. Creditors who accept this type of share should regard it as compensation for half of their debt. This type of share has a fixed cumulative preferred dividend right calculated at an annual interest rate of 4%, which is paid from the profits after the first preferred shares, and its distribution of dividends is after the above-mentioned first preferred shares with an 8% interest rate and before the ordinary shares. (C) Holders of the first and second preferred shares have one vote per share held and are subject to Articles 113 to 125 of the Bank's articles of association regarding shareholders' voting rights. Holders of the Bank's ordinary shares have one vote for every two shares held. The provisions of Articles 113 to 125 of the Bank's articles of association must be applied separately. (4) In any year, if the company's profits at the end of the year, after deducting enough to distribute, (A) the above-mentioned first preferred share dividend, (B) the second preferred share dividend, if there is still a surplus, it will be divided equally between the holders of the first preferred shares and the holders of ordinary shares. The method of distribution is that if the dividend on ordinary shares does not exceed 4% of the value of each hundred, it will be distributed according to the dividend on ordinary shares. However, in any case, the equal amount of distribution shall not exceed the fixed amount. (5) The amount of the second preferred shares that the Bank's unsecured creditors should receive shall not exceed half of the amount of debt owed by the Bank to them. No such shares shall be given for odd numbers less than ten yuan. (6) The Bank will issue bearer bonds to each unsecured creditor to offset half of the remaining debt owed by the Bank. This amount will still be counted as the amount owed by the Bank, but no interest will be calculated. It will be amortized and repaid to each creditor, or their executor, or administrator of the estate, or assignee in five years (so that each bond can be redeemed in full). Each installment shall not be less than one-fifth of the said half. The first installment shall be paid within twelve months after this plan becomes binding. This bond may be used by the holder at any time to offset the debt owed by the holder to the Bank before the Bank's suspension of operations, or to purchase or exchange any of the Bank's assets. (7) When a meeting of creditors is held in accordance with the order of the court, five supervisors and one special manager should be elected immediately to handle all the affairs required for the implementation of this plan, including the review of debt amounts and the management of the Bank's usual business, all of which are included from the date this plan becomes binding until the election of new directors. (8) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this plan, if any of the Bank's creditors have the right to full compensation prior to other debts based on Article 251 of the Companies Ordinance of 1932 or other provisions, the Supervisory Committee shall, within four weeks after this plan becomes binding, allocate funds from the Bank's assets to fully compensate them. (9) After this plan is approved, the directors should immediately resign from their positions. Before the new directors are elected in accordance with Article 10 of this plan, the supervisors and special managers, in accordance with the provisions of this plan, should manage the business on behalf of them, in addition to complying with the various provisions of this plan, and be responsible for clearing all the benefits received to the new directors. Any debts incurred due to public service and various expenses incurred in the implementation of this plan shall be compensated by the Bank in full. (10) The Supervisory Committee or the Board of Directors has the right to pay in cash the amount of mortgage debt that has not been recovered, such as odd numbers less than twenty yuan or ten yuan. (11) The term "unsecured creditor" in this plan should be interpreted to include all creditors whose debts have been recognized by the Supervisory Committee (excluding secured creditors and creditors mentioned in Article 8). (12) Within four months after this plan becomes binding, a shareholders' meeting of various types of shareholders must be convened to elect the Bank's directors in accordance with the provisions of the articles of association. (13) Once the unsecured creditors of this Bank accept the various provisions in this plan that are beneficial to the creditor, their various claims against this Bank and its assets should be regarded as having been fully settled. (14) Within twelve weeks after this plan becomes binding, at least 30,000 preferred shares must be collected and the share capital must be fully paid up. Otherwise, the Supervisory Committee may, with the approval of the court, declare that this plan has failed. Once such a declaration is made, liquidation procedures must be carried out, and the various provisions of this plan will be invalid. (15) If it is necessary to amend the memorandum of association and the articles of association due to the implementation of this plan, they must be amended accordingly. (16) All public fees and miscellaneous fees required for this plan and the implementation of the plan should be paid by this Bank. (17) The court should approve any modifications or conditions that the court deems appropriate to this plan. (18) Except as otherwise provided in the above, the various provisions of this plan shall not prejudice any pledge, lien, or mortgage.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>First, the chairman reported on the situation, briefly stating that when the Suiyuan bandit suppression military was winning victories, the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, shocking the country. All sectors were deeply concerned about the safety of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, news has been received that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's advisor, Donald, has returned from Xi'an to Luoyang and telegraphed Minister Kong, saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is indeed safe in Xi'an. He himself (referring to Donald) is unable to fly to Beijing immediately due to heavy rain in Luoyang. If so, we should be greatly relieved. Then, Qian Xinzhi and Wang Xiaolai successively reported and stated that the decision to comfort the Suiyuan bandit suppression army will continue as planned to strengthen the soldiers' will to resist the enemy and defend the territory. In addition, Luo Youxuan, Pang Jingzhou, and Hu Yunqiu, who had just returned to Shanghai from Suiyuan, also gave detailed reports. The length of the reports are omitted.</p>

(2) The board of directors reported the approval of new members Chen Jicheng, Xu Xiaochu, Yao Xizhou, Zhang Shulin, Hu Xiyuan, Dai Gengxin, and Yang Guanbei. (3) The board of directors reported that the general affairs group has more complicated affairs, and in accordance with Article 5 of the articles of association, an additional deputy director has been added, and Wang Kuisheng has been appointed. (4) The board of directors reported that the Shanghai Municipal Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association have repeatedly sent letters stating that the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have banned the export of rice from the provinces, and the governments of Yueqing, Pingyang, and Zhenhai in Zhejiang and Qingpu, Jinshan, and Jiading counties in Jiangsu have detained rice boats, which affects the rice supply in Shanghai. They have respectively telegraphed the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces to order the counties to release the rice. Now the Jiangsu Provincial Government has abolished the order banning the export of rice. (5) The board of directors reported that the association and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted five opinions to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry on the seven provisional measures for government agencies to purchase domestic goods, which were approved at the meeting of the Executive Yuan of the National Government on November 3. The Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan has now replied to consider and handle them. (6) The board of directors reported that member Zhang Rongchu donated more than 500 pieces of redwood furniture, men's and women's leather clothing, calligraphy, painting, silverware, etc., worth approximately 30,0088 yuan and 2 jiao, and requested that the money obtained from the auction by the association be used for the Suiyuan bandit suppression consolation expenses. A list has been attached. The board of directors has decided to hand it over to the general affairs group to formulate a plan. The items have now been displayed on the third floor of the Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association (7) The report about the Xi'an Incident. On the 14th, the association telegraphed Vice Chairman Yan, asking him to quickly rescue Chiang Kai-shek nearby and take full responsibility for the Suiyuan incident. On the same day, it jointly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Money Exchange Association, and the Shipping Association, asking him to protect Chiang Kai-shek's safety and cherish the country's vitality. Please ratify and discuss other methods. Also, proposed issues: 1. The board of directors submitted a draft budget for the association's expenses for the first half of the 26th year. It was resolved to hand it over to the board of directors. 2. It was proposed that the general affairs group submit a draft plan for the auction of commemorative gifts donated by member Zhang Rongchu to assist Suiyuan. It was resolved to hand it over to the board of directors.</p>
<p>Situation of Comforting the Troops</p>
<p>Luo Youxuan, the representative of the Shanghai Committee for Comforting and Rescuing the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Army in Suiyuan, recently returned to Shanghai from Xi'an and reported on the situation of comforting the troops in Suiyuan, saying that when the Shanghai Comfort Group arrived in Suiyuan, Youxuan was entrusted by Mr. Wang, Lin, and Huang to temporarily stay in Suiyuan, partly to comfort the soldiers at the front line and partly to make on-the-spot investigations. The process is reported as follows: On November 25 and 26, a general inspection was made in Suiyuan Province, and the Suiyuan Woolen Mill was visited. The factory is very small, powered by electricity, and has about 150 employees. The products are felt, tweed, etc. The quality is good. Except for the dyes, the rest are domestic raw materials. Ordinary people have a fairly adequate life because of the sparse population and the relatively fertile land. The wages of hired farmers are about 40 to 50 yuan per year. The entire Suiyuan can offset income and expenditure in terms of economics and finance (the total expenditure of the provincial government is only more than 80,000 yuan). Therefore, although the population is only more than 2 million, it is still enough to maintain the local area and be the vanguard of resisting foreign insults. Now the order in Suiyuan is quite good, there are no beggars in the provincial city, and there are not many unemployed. On November 27, he set off from Suiyuan, passed through Wuchuan, and went to Bailingmiao, the foremost of our army (the temple is 360 li from Suiyuan Province, but actually 500 li). Along the way, there are 120 li of uninhabited grasslands. It has snowed now, and the temperature is about minus 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. It is extremely difficult for our army to operate. He arrived at the temple at 10:30 that night. The temple is surrounded by mountains, like a city wall. There is a small plain in the middle, and a stream of water surrounds it in the back. The temple is built between the plain and the stream, with more than 200 houses. The main hall is beautifully constructed. In the life of thousands of miles of grasslands, only tents are holy relics. The temple is a holy place for Mongolians in terms of religion, and a channel for Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang in terms of transportation. The Japanese have been operating in this place for four years. According to personal superficial estimates, the operation of the Bailingmiao special agency is at least more than 5 million yuan. This time, the puppet Mongolian army was defeated, and the items left by the Japanese, the number of which can be counted, are more than 20,000 bags of flour, 500,000 jin of coal, 300-400 boxes of gasoline, and 30-40 new-style stoves. The head of the special agency, Shengdao Jiaofang, and more than 20 assistant personnel are stationed in the temple all year round. However, according to Sui espionage, the Japanese have spent 40 million yuan in special funds for the special agencies commanded by the Guandong Army in Duolun, Jiabusi, Bailingmiao, Heishatu, Dingyuanying, and Ejina. Previously, there were regular air flights to the above-mentioned places, and the special personnel in Bailingmiao all studied the Chinese language and studied Chinese affairs. After careful investigation, no books studying the Soviet Union were found, and no one was learning Russian. Now the defense of our side of the temple is consolidated, and the morale is particularly strong. It is a pity that it is too far away from Suiyuan. In the event of a major war, it will be difficult to respond. However, the operation of the factory is also similarly difficult. On the 28th, he returned to Suiyuan, and on the 30th, he arrived at Pingdiquan. At the right time, the 13th Army of Tang arrived at the place and was preparing to advance the construction and enrich the defense line. Solid fortifications have been built in Fengzhen, Datong, and the Taihang Mountains. Strongholds have been established in key areas of Jin and Sui, and an offensive defense has been adopted. Although Taiyuan does not advocate immediately taking Shangdu and Zhangbei, it is preparing to deal with the war. The expression of unity from top to bottom in Jin and Sui is very obvious, and the central government and the local government are quite consistent. Political preparation is also gradually becoming more comprehensive. He left B on the 5th of this month, arrived in Xi'an on the 8th, and left Xi'an on the evening of the 10th to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Proposed Important Cases</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union's motion to the conference stated that, according to reports, Zhang Xueliang's troops suddenly rebelled in Xi'an and kidnapped the commander. The news was shocking. The association convened an emergency executive committee meeting this morning to discuss countermeasures. It was agreed that at this emergency time, the actions of all groups should be consistent and united to align their steps and respond to the situation. It was resolved to form a joint office of various groups, etc., and the record was recorded. In addition to sending letters to the outside world, the case was specially recorded and presented, and three members, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Shao Xubai, were recommended to contact the former. After Zhu Xuefan supplemented the reasons for the proposal on the spot, the members discussed it, and they all believed that at the time of this incident, it was absolutely necessary to align their steps and express public opinion to comfort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It was proposed that representatives be sent to Xi'an when necessary. After discussion, it was decided to hand it over to the board of directors for deliberation and handling.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Road Association launched a fundraising campaign for ambulances to assist Suiyuan. At 2:00 PM yesterday, they specially invited major automobile companies in Shanghai to a tea party at the YMCA to discuss car purchase methods and organize a car purchase committee to be responsible for the progress. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included Wang Rutang, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Guan Jiongzhi, Qu Wenliu, Tai Shuangqiu, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Yiting, Chen Tiesheng, Wang Zhenchang, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Shaoping, Lou Zhaonian, Le Zhenbao, Huang Ruisheng, Fan Shouyuan, Lu Bohong, Chen Qifen, Huang Renzhi, Wang Sifang, Chen Guangfu, Lu Yingen, Lu Xianglin, Yang Hansan, and more than 40 representatives from Daxia Automobile Company, Xintong Automobile Company, and Deda Automobile Company. Wang Rutang presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman Wang Rutang reported, saying that the bandits and puppets have stolen and committed crimes in our Sui border. General Fu Zuoyi led his subordinates to defend the border for the sake of national survival. Fortunately, the soldiers used their lives and were united. In the Battle of Bailingmiao, the enemy was defeated and fled. Looking forward to the future, we are very fortunate. However, when swords meet and bullets collide, our army's casualties are unavoidable. In addition, the snowy and icy weather and the dangerous transportation make it difficult and time-consuming to transport the wounded comrades in arms on the front line. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to rescue them. The association has always been committed to serving the society and dares not lag behind in national salvation work. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign for ambulances to collect several cars and send them to the Red Cross for the exclusive use of rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line. This matter is of great importance and relies on the collective efforts of the people. In addition to raising donations from all parties to prepare for the purchase, we also request major automobile companies in the city to make special arrangements for the sale price and reduce the price in order to rescue the wounded soldiers for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Car Purchase Method</p>
<p>The following car purchase methods are proposed: (1) These cars are specially negotiated for purchase from various companies, and a special discount is given according to the list price. (2) If a company agrees to sell a certain number of cars, the association will list the brand, list price, current sale price, and special discount separately in the donation advertisement to be a model. (3) The aforementioned vehicles will be sent to the Chinese Red Cross Society for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line and shall not be used for other purposes. (4) The purchase of vehicles will be jointly raised and collected by the association and various charitable organizations in the city. The donations will be deposited in the designated bank at any time and used for car purchase.</p>
<p>Organize Car Purchase Association</p>
<p>At that time, it was also decided to organize a car purchase committee, which will be formed by four representatives from the Charity Federation, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Road Association, namely Zhao Jinqing, Yan Fuqing, Qian Xinzhi, and Lou Zhaonian, and five representatives from the automobile companies, namely Smith, Myers, Frantmenkrow, and a representative from Youfu or Dachang to be determined, a total of nine people.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Launch of Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group: Tunam Dinner Party <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Research on Nanyang Trade</p>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, sponsored by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, has been working on the finalization of all matters since its return to the country. It is now known that the group's head and deputy heads, Gao Shiheng, Hu Shicheng, and Secretary Yang Zhonggao, are currently collecting materials and compiling reports separately. The content is extremely detailed and can serve as a guide for doing business in Nanyang. It will be finalized by the end of the year and printed, with publication expected in February next year. In addition, the group has launched the Tunam Dinner Party to study Nanyang trade and make long-term plans. The origin and rules of the association are listed below:</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>After the thorough observation and investigation of various parts of Nanyang by our inspection group, it is believed that it is indeed a good market, especially with great hope for the export of our country's goods. This is because our more than six million overseas Chinese, who control the authority of commercial economy, are all determined to promote and use domestic products. If we do not make good use of this great opportunity to promote the advancement of domestic goods to the south, wouldn't it be self-abandonment, failing the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese to protect the motherland? I, along with the inspection group colleagues, bear the heavy responsibility of expanding this overseas market for domestic goods. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is necessary to combine the spirit and intelligence of all our colleagues to conduct continuous research. By gathering ideas and benefiting from each other, we can receive twice the results with half the effort. However, we are all constrained by our duties, and it is not allowed by facts to gather and discuss at any time. Therefore, there is the launch of a dinner party, which is held once a month. It can not only maintain the feelings of the April group for a long time, but also use the conversations after tea and wine to exchange opinions and learn from each other, so that our country's goods can have a solid position in the Nanyang market in the future, and become brighter and larger. Therefore, the significance of this dinner party is not in the pursuit of food and drink, but in striving for the advancement of domestic goods to the south. Therefore, it is named Tunam. I believe that all colleagues will be happy to agree. This is the inspiration.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>(1) All colleagues who participated in the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group are eligible to be members. (2) The dinner party is scheduled for 7:00 PM on the 16th of each month. (3) The cost of each dinner is two yuan in legal tender per person, and those who are unable to attend for any reason must also pay. (4) Each time, one person on duty serves as the secretary, presiding over the seat arrangement, sending invitations, and collecting and paying funds. At each dinner, the next secretary is elected. (5) The association will last for a long time and will not be suspended midway. (6) Any domestic goods manufacturer who intends to develop trade in Nanyang and is willing to join the association as a member and conduct joint research may also participate with the introduction of two members.</p>

<p>Wang Zhishen, General Manager of Xinhua Bank, traveled to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong, and investigated the financial and social conditions in various places. He returned to Shanghai the night before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he told the Central News Agency reporters that he had a very good impression of his trip to the southwest. After the completion of national political unification, the people in various places were able to clearly identify a certain goal and work hard on economic construction. On the way back, he learned about the Xi'an Incident, which was a great misfortune for the country and a heavy blow to the people's spirit. The politics and economy of Yunnan Province have been on track, and the currency system has not yet been unified. However, the Yunnan currency used is relatively stable, with the old one equivalent to 1 jiao (1/10 of a yuan) of national currency and the new one equivalent to 5 jiao (1/2 yuan). It will be easy to reform in the future. If the transportation in the southwestern provinces is improved, the economic development can be integrated with the whole country. Wang continued that the bank's board of directors had long decided to set up a branch in Guangdong. This trip was to contact the local area. After the site is determined, it can be opened in the short term. In Sichuan Province, it has entrusted the Bank of China to provide loans on its behalf. At present, no branch will be set up for the time being.</p>

<p>- Gu's Family is Rushing to Complete the Procedures -</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Special Second Court for suspicion of inciting murder. He appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which overturned the conviction and declared him innocent. Currently, the Law Enforcement Office is applying to the prosecutor of the First Branch of the High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. Subsequently, a case of inciting perjury arose, which is not being tried in the Special Second Court. He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for opium smoking in an outside prison, which was approved by the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to the criminal court</p>
<p>Request for Sentence Reduction</p>
<p>Approved by Adjudication</p>
<p>A month was deducted from the sentence, and he served seven months. After being released from prison, he was transferred to custody. Later, Gu filed a petition with the High Court and the Special Second Court to stop the arrest. The First Court has allowed him to find two reputable shopkeepers to issue a guarantee of 20,000 yuan and allow him to stop the arrest. The ruling of the Third Branch of the High Court has not been issued and is</p>
<p>Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>The above information has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by two judges, Liao and Wang Tie, arrived at the Third Criminal Court and ordered Gu Zhuxuan to be brought to court. After questioning his age and origin, the judge said, "Gu, regarding your case of inciting murder, which is now under appeal, you are requesting bail. However, the case is serious and you should provide a substantial guarantee." Gu replied, "The market is currently depressed, and</p>
<p>All My Business</p>
<p>Since being arrested, all have failed. I cannot provide cash, but I can only find a considerable reputable shop guarantee. I have been doing business in Shanghai for more than ten years and have never left. I have no intention of escaping." The judge said, "Now you are allowed to post a guarantee of 20,000 yuan. Considering the market is not prosperous, you are required to pay half, 10,000 yuan in cash, and find a shop guarantee for the other half, 10,000 yuan, with a guarantee of availability upon call." After Gu and his</p>
<p>Defense Attorney</p>
<p>Repeatedly pleaded with the court to forgive and reduce the amount, allowing him to post a shop guarantee to avoid paying cash, or reduce the amount of cash. Gu also stated that Wang Xinggao was sentenced to life imprisonment, and after the appeal was ruled innocent, he also posted a 10,000 yuan shop guarantee. My initial trial was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and the appeal was ruled innocent. In essence, it is lighter than Wang's, and I should also be granted a reduced bail. The judge said that the ratio cannot be determined based on</p>
<p>Determined by Identity</p>
<p>After discussion in court, it was finally decided that Gu would pay 7,000 yuan in cash and provide a guarantee of 10,000 yuan in writing from two shops, plus a guarantee of availability upon call. After the guarantee is verified, he can be released. Gu also said that a 10,000 yuan shop guarantee had already been provided by the Special Second Court. However, my business has always been in the British Concession, and now all the properties have been mortgaged and the rent cannot be collected. Please</p>
<p>Reduce the Amount Again</p>
<p>The court ruled that if the cash cannot be paid temporarily, the government bonds and other valuable securities will be temporarily used as collateral. Gu complied with the order and was taken down by the mountain police. Gu's family, including his brother Gu Song and Gu's wives and Zheng Qian, the husband of his sister, were all listening in court. Upon hearing the ruling, they immediately went to complete the bail procedures. Gu's family intends to raise 5,000 Hong Kong dollars worth of shares of the Great New Company, plus enough legal tender to handle the case. Within a day, Gu will be restored to freedom. According to Gu, he was arrested and detained on September 10 last year and has been detained for fifteen months and zero days.</p>

Unexpectedly, it was discovered by bandits, and four robbers, Wang Jiqing, Wang A'er, Xiaolaotou, and Jin Qing, all from Ningbo, secretly gathered in Room 67 of the Ningxing Hotel at No. 479 Edward Road, intending to go to rob. Xiaolaotou and Jin Qing provided two pistols and first went to wait near Lu Gaojian Junji Meat Shop,</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity to Rob</p>
<p>At 7:30 pm the night before last, the front door of the meat shop had already closed, but the shop assistant Deng Zhongzhong opened the back door because of internal urgency (the back door is located in Lean Lane). Unexpectedly, the four robbers, Wang and others, had been secretly waiting in the alley, and they took the opportunity to rush in and drove Xu Jinsheng and his wife into the kitchen, guarding them with guns, forcing them to hand over the key to the safe, and then opened the safe to rob 3,100 yuan in legal tender, 900 yuan in silver dollars, a bundle of subsidiary coins, two gold bracelets, a gold ring,</p>
<p>Two Gems</p>
<p>A cat skin robe, a pair of trousers, and other items were put into a rattan box. Wang Jiqing held a gun and continued to guard them. The other robbers fled with the stolen goods. After ten minutes, Wang thought the three robbers had escaped far away, so he also escaped from the back door. The victim, Xu Jinsheng, then went out from the front door and shouted for help on the street. The robber Wang had also escaped from the alley to the road. Seeing the victim yelling, he knew he had failed, so he pulled out a handgun from his side and fired a shot at Xu, but Xu dodged it. The robber Wang intended to</p>
<p>Continue Firing</p>
<p>But the bullet was jammed, so he had to run away desperately. Hua Police No. 2660 heard the alarm and chased after him with passers-by such as Lang, and finally caught Wang Jiqing in the Maoxunli Lane of Shanhai Guan Road, seized a pistol with two bullets, and found a gold bracelet and 34 jiao in small bills on his body, and took him to the Xinzha Police Station. After interrogation by Hua Detective Yang Fusheng and Ma Zhongrong, he confessed that there were</p>
<p>Accomplices Hiding</p>
<p>In the Ningxing Hotel, they immediately went to Room 67 of the Ningxing Hotel with the French Concession Police detectives and waited until about 9 pm when Wang A'er broke into the room and was arrested. They confiscated 500 yuan in legal tender and took him back to the police station. According to Wang A'er's confession, they robbed the meat shop and shared the spoils at No. 9 Yongshunli, Tangjiawan, Ximen, after the robbery. He received 500 yuan of the stolen money. At the time of the loot split, there were landlords, Yu Zhushi and Dai Ronghai</p>
<p>Two People on Site</p>
<p>And other words, the Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest the two and temporarily detained them at the Public Security Bureau, waiting for the document to be transferred. Yesterday morning, Wang Jiqing and Wang A'er were escorted to the Third Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit in accordance with the crimes of robbery and attempted murder, and detailed the above situation. Because the accomplices have not been arrested and the stolen goods have not been recovered, he requested</p>
<p>Permission to Reschedule</p>
<p>Then the criminal victim Xu Jinsheng and witness Bao Lang filed a case, stating the situation of being robbed, and identified the two defendants in court as robbers at the scene, and both were holding handguns. When questioned, the defendants admitted that they had gone to rob with the fugitives Xiaolaotou and Jin Qing. Judge Huang ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled for seven days. The stolen goods were first returned.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Bao Gang's Case Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Qinghong Suddenly Reversed His Previous Testimony, Admitting That Bao and Yang Lived in His Home</p>
<p>Bao Gang's lawyer was sued by Cui Changgui, the bodyguard of Liu Huaizhi, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, for inducing his fiancee Yang Yuehua to live in Zhang Qinghong's home in the third district of Chuansha. The local court filed a public prosecution, and Bao Gang and Bao's intermediary Zhang Xinkui were detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xie of the local court opened the second criminal court for a continued trial and summoned Zhang Qinghong to court for further interrogation. However, Zhang Qinghong claimed that he graduated from Peidong Middle School and was not a classmate with Bao, and did not know Yang Yuehua and had never been to his home when he first appeared in court to testify. Before the special commissioner of the Jiangsu Supervisory Office, he also swore that if he did hide Yang Yuehua, he would accept the most severe punishment from the party. The latter's wife, Yu Shi, stated in court that Bao had lodged Yang Yuehua in her home in the name of a concubine, and had taken photos with Yang Yuehua, so the court repeatedly summoned Zhang Qinghong to court, but yesterday Zhang Qinghong's testimony reversed his previous testimony, claiming that he and Bao Gang were classmates at Chizhi University, Bao was in the law department, and he was in the political science department. My home is twelve miles away from Bao's home. On May 20 this year, he brought a woman and said it was a concubine. He first went to my district, and then he went to my home. The judge asked what your wife's surname was. He replied, "Xu", and also claimed that taking photos with Yang Yuehua and disguising himself as a man was done by my wife, Yao Shi. I don't know it was abducted, but I knew that Bao's family had a big wife, but I didn't know him. Yang Yuehua lived in my house for a total of two weeks, but I only saw her once because I was in the district. We are fellow villagers and classmates, so we took her in, and he also said that the wife and concubines did not get along, and living for two days is also a matter of human nature. After Bao Gang arrived in Chuansha on May 20, I have not seen him, but my wife said that he came twice in the middle. When Cui Changgui came to look for Yang Yuehua, my wife and I happened to come to Shanghai. At this point, the judge immediately said that you have sworn now, and telling lies will be punished for perjury. He replied, "Yes." At this point, Bao Gang was brought to court and asked how he would argue with Zhang Qinghong's testimony. Bao Yun said, "Absolutely not." At this point, he asked Zhang Xinkui, who claimed that he did not entice Yang Yuehua to the Dafang Hotel on May 12 to commit adultery with Bao Gang. At that time, I went back because my niece got married, and the township chief Lu Binglin can testify. The official often summons Lu Binglin to testify. He is forty-six years old, the head of Beicai Township in Nanhui, and a doctor. I only know about Zhang Xinkui's niece's wedding. I don't know how many days Zhang Xinkui lived at home. In short, his testimony is completely irresponsible. At this point, Cui Changgui and Yang Yuehua went to court and claimed that after the couple quarreled, Bao Gang took advantage of the opportunity to have illicit relations with Yang Yuehua three times at the Dafang Hotel, and then intimidated and abducted her to Zhang Qinghong's home for hiding, where I found her. At this point, after inviting the Kong prosecutor to express his opinions in court, the defense lawyers argued once, and the judge said that the arguments were over and the sentence would be pronounced on the 19th of this month.</p>

<p>Kuang Hongsheng, who lived at No. 82 Gordon Road, was suddenly shot and injured at about 11 pm on the 20th of last month. Li Gensheng from Ningbo, Wang Jinshan and Yao Ronggen from Shanghai, three criminals have been arrested by the Putuo Road Police Station, and a pistol and six bullets were confiscated and sent to the First Special Court.

A pistol and six bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e161">County Magistrate Sprayed with Acid Case: Mid-Course Incident. Plaintiff Accuses Lawyer Gu Changyuan of Destroying Evidence and Using Perjury to Collude. Prosecutor Indicts After Investigation. <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xueseng, the former magistrate of Zhangye County, Gansu Province, and head of the Opium Prohibition Bureau, a native of Songjiang, was splashed with nitric acid on his face in the French Concession's Wangzhi Road in March of this year. Gao Jinsheng, the perpetrator, was apprehended on the spot and sentenced to four years in prison by the Second Special District Court. The case is currently under appeal in the Supreme Court. Subsequently, Xu also filed a criminal self-indictment with the Shanghai District Court, accusing his fellow townsman, Zhu Guanghan, of instigating Chen Axi to instruct Gao Jinsheng to harm Xu, requesting punishment. The case was initially heard by Judge Wu Deying, but because Judge Wu was transferred to the Jiangsu High Court branch in Xuzhou, Judge Yu Lude took over the case. Unexpectedly, while Judge Yu was investigating, he was recently transferred to become an execution judge. Therefore, the case was transferred again to Judge Liu Bojun for a new hearing, scheduled to continue at 2:00 PM today. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, while the case was under detailed investigation and no decision had been made, an incident occurred. Since the case began, the defendant Zhu Guanghan hired lawyer Gu Changyuan to represent him in his defense. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff Xu Xueseng recently discovered that lawyer Gu had committed crimes such as destroying evidence and colluding with perjury in this case. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. The Prosecutor's Office approved the complaint, and Prosecutor Wang Jiamei conducted a detailed investigation. The Prosecutor's Office believes that a public prosecution should be initiated, and the original indictment is transcribed below. Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office Indictment: Defendant Gu Changyuan, 46 years old, native of Jiaxing, is under the custody of lawyer Zou Shengshi. Fang Aliu, 27 years old, native of Ningbo, is in custody. The defendant is charged with evidence destruction and perjury in the Criminal Case No. 4554 of the 25th year of the Republic of China. The prosecutor has completed the investigation of the case and believes that a public prosecution should be initiated. The defendant's criminal facts, evidence, and the applicable legal provisions are listed below: (Criminal Facts) In May of this year, Xu Xueseng filed a self-indictment with the Criminal Division of this court, accusing Zhu Guanghan of instigating Gao Jinsheng to harm his body. Zhu Guanghan selected lawyer Gu Changyuan as his defense counsel. Gu Changyuan went to the Shanghai First Special District Court Detention Center on May 16th, May 23rd, and June 9th to meet with Gao Jinsheng, instigating him to conceal his testimony and promising him 100 yuan as a reward. Gao Jinsheng had asked his aunt through a letter from the detention center to request payment from Gu Changyuan. Fang Aliu, as Gao Jinsheng's sworn brother, was well aware of the situation and had previously testified under oath in the Criminal Division of this court. The letter from his aunt was obtained and presented to the court as evidence. However, during the court's investigation, Fang Aliu suddenly reversed his previous testimony in an attempt to exonerate Gu Changyuan, and he also testified under oath. (Evidence and Applicable Legal Provisions) Gu Changyuan went to the Shanghai Second Special District Court Detention Center to meet with Gao Jinsheng three times during Xu Xueseng's self-indictment in this court against Zhu Guanghan for instigating harm, as evidenced by the visitation log there. Gao Jinsheng sent a letter from the detention center to his aunt and uncle "Fang Aliu's aunt and uncle," which stated, "This afternoon, lawyer Gu visited me at the detention center. I told him all the details. Mr. Gu promised me 100 yuan. Now I'm asking Mr. Wu in his letter to quickly go to lawyer Gu's residence to collect the money." This letter was sent out by someone and was not inspected by the detention center. Although Gao Jinsheng did not admit to it, there was another letter issued by the detention center stating, "There is no need to see lawyer Gu now. They will come to see me later." The inspection stamp affixed to this letter has been verified by the Second Special District Prison, and it matches the prison's official stamp. The reply letter No. 462 dated October 29 of this year, both letters' handwriting, has also been identified as written by the same person. "Reference to the Identification Report." Gu Changyuan is Zhu Guanghan's defense counsel, and Gao Jinsheng did not entrust him with anything, so there was no need to meet with him. Even less reason to pay Gao Jinsheng 100 yuan as a reward. Now, during the meeting, he not only promised a reward, but also, based on Fang Aliu's testimony in the Criminal Division of this court on October 12 of this year, "Zhu Guanghan spent money to settle Gao Jinsheng's family after Gao Jinsheng harmed Xu Xueseng with acid," it is known that Gao Jinsheng's harm to Xu Xueseng was indeed instigated by Zhu Guanghan. Gu Changyuan, as Zhu Guanghan's defense counsel, naturally did not want Gao Jinsheng to testify in court and conceal the truth. As a result of the reward and collusion, Gao Jinsheng was willing to take the blame alone and never attacked Zhu Guanghan. Gu Changyuan's crime of instigating the concealment of testimony is indeed credible. According to Article 29, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, he should be considered an instigator of Article 165 of the same law. Fang Aliu had previously testified in the Criminal Division of this court that he had been friends with Gao Jinsheng for six years, that the letter issued by Gao Jinsheng in the detention center was obtained from his aunt's house, and that the letter with the inspection stamp was also said to be written by Gao Jinsheng. His testimony was detailed and he swore an oath. Now, on November 25, regarding the case of Gu Changyuan instigating concealment of testimony, his testimony is inconsistent with Gao Jinsheng and completely denies his previous testimony, which is obviously perjury. He has committed the crime of Article 168 of the Criminal Law. It is appropriate to file a prosecution in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Please try the case according to law. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Division of this court. December 7, 25th year of the Republic of China. Prosecutor Wang Jiamei.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Residents of Lixing Town Petition for Changes to River Dredging Plan <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the East and West Zhu Family Gully Issue</p>
<p>The dredging of the East and West Zhu Family Gully in the Lixing District of Pudong requires passing through Dutai River, which will obstruct the houses of the town's households. Therefore, the residents of the town petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Government to change the plan. The document states that the dredging of the town river will obstruct the residents' houses, and they request that the government adopt a plan that protects property rights and maintains the people's livelihood. Meng Hua and others are citizens of the Lixing District of this city and have lived in Lixing Town for generations. Some have established shops, and others are residences. In the past few years, the river channel of the East and West Zhu Family Gully in this township was silted up, and the irrigation of farmland was at stake. The citizens proposed dredging, and because the situation in each township was different, they presented the various obstacles to the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau and the Lixing District Municipal Committee Office, requesting a detailed discussion and cautious implementation. The Municipal Government clearly ordered that the section of the town's river be dredged together with the East and West Zhu Family Gully. This should be complied with. Regarding the request to build dams at the river mouth where the East and West Zhu Family Gully connect to the Dutai River, officials should be sent to investigate the actual situation before further review. The superiors were very considerate of the people's difficulties. However, the Zhu Family Gully has been silted up for a long time. Although dredging is necessary, it is necessary to dredge the trunk rivers such as the Ma Family River and Dutai River first to achieve the effect of connecting the trunk and branches. Recently, the old matter has been brought up again, and the previous proposal has been reiterated. Meng Hua and others have a vital stake and cannot remain silent. They respectfully present their views to the Municipal Government in detail. The Zhu Family Gully is divided into two streams, east and west, passing through figures 4, 5, 6, 38, and 44, with a length of seven miles. Figure 6 accounts for three-quarters of the length and is more closely related. The rising tide of the West Zhu Family River flows in from the Ma Family Hong River, and its discharge must also pass through the Ma Family Hong River mouth. This is because its downward flow is lower and faster than the meandering Dutai River, which flows far and slowly. It is impossible to compare the two. Dredging the West Zhu Family Gully to connect to the Ma Family Hong River is sufficient to accommodate the ebb and flow of the tide. The East Zhu Family Gully is connected to the Yunyan River in the east, directly reaching Hangzhou. The source is large and the circulation is fast, so there is no problem for discharge. However, the Zhu Family Gully is not suitable for navigation and can only be used for farmland irrigation. But farmland irrigation is suitable for clean water and not tidal water. Anyone with a little knowledge of agriculture can know this. If we still hold the previous proposal to dredge the town's river together, the tide will invade with fierce force, and the amount of sediment carried in will be even greater. Not only will we repeat the situation of the Zhuang Family Gully near the river being dredged and silted up three times every ten years, but also the internal tributaries will be silted up and become dry. This will cause the families that use it for farmland irrigation to be cut off from the source of drinking water for the residents. Dredging again and again will be endless, and our people will be exhausted and have no time to breathe. This is the first disadvantage of dredging the Zhu Family Gully and the town's river together. Also, the section of the Zhu Family Gully's town river is an important market town in Lixing Town. The small shops of hundreds of households will inevitably be demolished and have no way to survive. Even if the width is reduced and construction and dredging are carried out, the foundation of the houses on both sides will inevitably be loosened and collapse. At a time when rural commerce is declining, there is no such financial resources to seek another way to make a living. It is tantamount to sacrificing the lives and property of hundreds of households to dredge the town's river and destroying the market town, causing the residents to be displaced and forever sinking into an irrecoverable abyss. Although the citizens are foolish, at this critical juncture of life and death, they will certainly rise up and resist, and they will never be willing to submit. If this leads to an accident, who will take the blame? This is the second disadvantage of dredging the Zhu Family Gully and the town's river together. Looking at the history of the town's river, there is the Sen Yutang, Chengyi Tang, Yixun Tang, and Yinxiang Caotang in the south of the river, and the Tao Shen family's memorial arch for filial piety in the north of the river. These were all constructed during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Former Qing Dynasty, and their ruins still exist today. This can serve as ironclad proof that the town's river cannot be easily dredged. Also, the two dredgings of the Zhu Family Gully in the 52nd year before the founding of the Republic of China and in the 6th year of the Republic of China both started from the Ma Family Hong River mouth and ended at the Little Wooden Bridge west of the town. The facts are available and can be easily investigated. This is the third disadvantage of dredging the Zhu Family Gully and the town's river together. As far as our humble opinions are concerned, we propose to dredge from the Ma Family Hong River mouth of the West Zhu Family Gully to the Little Wooden Bridge west of Lixing Town, and the East Zhu Family Gully from the Qifeng Bridge east of the town to the Xiantang River. A dam and sluice gate should be built at the Ma Family Hong River mouth in the West Zhu Family Gully to avoid the disadvantages of rising tide and siltation. The East Mi Family Gully has a long flow and a clean source, and there is no risk of siltation. This is the first advantage. Also, the built sluice gate can be opened and closed at any time, which is also a help in preventing drought and floods. Moreover, the sluice gate closes the water and cleans the river bottom silt, water plants, and other things, which are rich in fertilizer for the fields, making the river channel deeper and deeper, so our people can benefit once and for all. This is several advantages in one fell swoop. This is the second advantage. The silted areas of the town's river should be filled with soil to expand the streets in the future and maintain the prosperity of land transportation, which is beneficial to the market. This is the second advantage. Looking at the matter of building dams, such as the Wang Family Gully in figures 17 and 18 of this district, the original tidal tributary river channel had already been silted up. Therefore, construction began six years ago to dredge it. After dredging, a dam was built to change the tidal river into a clean water river. Today, the river channel of the gully is in good condition, and irrigation is convenient. This is the benefit of building a dam, there is an example to follow, and it is easy to investigate and obtain. In short, comparing the above-mentioned advantages and disadvantages, the citizens cannot agree to the proposal to dredge the Zhu Family Gully and the town's river together. If only the West Zhu Family Gully is dredged to the Little Wooden Bridge west of the town, and the East Zhu Family Gully to the Qifeng Bridge east of the town, and a sluice gate is set up at the Ma Family Hong River mouth, all the citizens will be happy to see it happen. This matter is related to the irrigation of the entire river and the interests of all the residents of the town. The livelihoods of Meng Hua and others are at stake, and they cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we dare not presume to present our humble views and recommend Tao Menghua, Tao Qinwen, Tao Hongcan, and Zhang Zhenqi as representatives to present the details in person. We respectfully request the Municipal Government to follow public opinion, approve the adoption of our proposal, and earnestly request that the section of the town's river be exempted from dredging before the plan is approved by public opinion. We respectfully beg for approval, and we will await orders with the utmost anxiety. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai. Submitters: Tao Menghua and 72 others.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 13, the 20th year of the Republic of China, a case occurred in the Fashang Hotel on Xinxinqiao Street in the French Concession where Jiangbei bandits brutally killed their comrades, Jiang Zhonghan, Xia Yongsheng, and a Xue surname person, and wounded Zhong Ziqing. The French Police apprehended the culprit, Yan Jinbiao, a native of Funing, on the spot. After prosecution, the Second Special Court sentenced him to death. The sentence was affirmed after three trials and executed according to law. During the interrogation, Yan confessed that the ringleader was his fellow townsman, Li Guocheng, also known as Chen Youliang. Li was handed over to the Public Security Bureau by Yan's family in Rihui Port. After being brought back by the Second Special Court for the initial trial, he was sentenced to death. He appealed to the High Court Three Branch, but the result was rejected. He appealed again to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial and changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Li was still dissatisfied, and his father filed an appeal with the Supreme Court for a retrial. Now, the reasons for the retrial have been sent back, stating that the case had undergone a general amnesty, which the original trial had not taken into account. The High Court Three Branch held a retrial and concluded the case the other day. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the court ruled to revoke the original judgment and sentenced Li Guocheng to twelve years of imprisonment for joint murder. After the verdict, he was sent back to the detention center. It is said that after Li left the court, he told his defense lawyer and family that he did not participate in the murder and was still being wrongly sentenced. He would never be willing to accept this and would file another appeal after receiving the judgment. This case has been going on for more than five years now. The Supreme Court has twice decided to send the case back for retrial. Li believes that he must be acquitted to be satisfied.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Renting School Premises: Opening a Casino at Night. "Cifanhheshang" and Others Thinking Wishfully. Many Arrested After Police Investigation. <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Fan Rongxi, a well-known gangster nicknamed "Cifanhheshang" (Rice Porridge Monk), and Yang Lansheng, nicknamed "Mapilansheng" (Pockmarked Lansheng), recently opened mobile gambling tables in the Dongyang Wharf area. Because the police authorities were strictly arresting them, they found it difficult to gain a foothold and had to relocate. The premises of a certain school at No. 28, Lane 411, Dagu Road, are owned by Li Jichang. The school has no classes at night. Fan and Yang took advantage of this opportunity to discuss with Li and temporarily set up a gambling place in the school. Every night, they called out numbers and gambled all night long. There were often as many as fifty or sixty gamblers. The Chengdu Road Police Station's Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and detectives Wang Yongjun, Xu Dezhong, and Sun Wenxi discovered this. Because they had good sources of information and there were many people, they were afraid of missing someone. Therefore, at 9:30 PM the other night, they dispatched additional detectives Chen Yaoting, Zhou Yushan, and Bao Detective Zhang Kui to the area and surrounded it. They immediately arrested the gamblers. At that time, they arrested forty-one gamblers, including Yang Ruisheng, Zhou Ajin, Hu Jinsheng, Cai Acheng, Wang San, Zhang Liangen, Zhang Xingsheng, Xue Xuyuan, Monk Zhu, Wang Zhaoxi, Wang Fusheng, Wang Arong, Liu Xianglin, Wang Xuqing, Chen Mulin, Gao Arong, Xia Youtang, Ni Shijin, Chen Adong, and Gu Xiaofeng, Sun Wenpu. Fan and Yang, the two ringleaders, had already escaped. They took all the gambling equipment back to the police station. Except for fifteen who were each allowed to post 100 yuan bail, the rest were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunhua, filed a gambling charge and said that the landlord, Li Jichang, would be appropriately punished. After questioning by Judge Ye Shengchao one by one, it was ruled that those who posted bail would be fined 40 yuan each, and the rest would be fined 15 yuan each.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Robbery and Injury on Gonghe Road <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The home of Tang Guoshun, a Taizhou native who manages the parcel room at the Postal Administration, is located at No. 37 at the end of Lane 4, Hexingli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. It is a single-room shikumen house. Tang himself lives in the back of the downstairs parlor, while the upstairs front building and the garret are rented out, and the back building is currently vacant. Unexpectedly, at around 7 pm the night before, Tang went to his relative's house for some business. Tang's wife was having dinner with the children when she suddenly heard someone knocking on the door. Tang's wife immediately went to open the door. The bandits claimed that they were going to see a friend in the garret. After entering the door, the bandits showed a pistol. Tang's wife knew that they were robbers, so she rushed into the room and closed the door tightly. The bandits then entered through the wall and pressed Tang's wife to the ground, and used the pistol butt to hit her head, hands, and feet, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden money. As a result, 110 yuan in legal tender belonging to Tang's relatives in the suitcase was robbed. Tang Guoshun's own 200 yuan in legal tender, 8 silver dollars, a gold bracelet, four rings, two spare buttons, men's and women's coats, raincoats, cheongsams, silver ornaments, etc., were robbed, worth about 700 yuan. The strangest thing is that when the bandits finished robbing and were about to leave, they were afraid that Tang's wife would go out and shout for help, so they brought a padlock to lock the door leading from the ladder down to the stove surface. All the raincoats and robes were worn away by the bandits, because it was raining at the time. Yesterday, Tang's wife's head and face were swollen, and she was seriously injured. Tang's wife said that everything in the room, except for the chamber pot, was ransacked by the bandits. Two pillows on the bed were also torn open, so the room was very messy. Yesterday, the victim has submitted a list to the police station in charge to investigate the stolen goods.</p>

<h3 id="e180">My Interview Experience <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Interviewer — Xu Songzi</p>
<p>In the cold wind, we were battling. From countless roads to obscure alleyways, it almost felt like the more we walked, the colder and more desolate it became, with only the rickshaw pullers' footsteps accompanying our own heartbeats.</p>
<p>It was already deep winter!</p>
<p>But the cold wind could not chill our passion for working for national products, nor could it chill the patriotic conscience of the giant that Chinese women are. Isn't it so? Who can say that our household interview work isn't expanding and deepening with the passage of time? Who can say that wise housewives are not deeply moved and standing on the front lines of economic national defense?</p>
<p>The past three months of interview work have not been in vain. But in order to strengthen the national products movement and share some of my foolish insights from my work experience, it is not without meaning, right?</p>
<p>1.  The Technique of Entering the Door</p>
<p>If we are conducting interviews in the morning, please remember not to knock on the front door. This is a common situation in Shanghai. Because in the morning, almost all housewives or maids are busy preparing lunch in the kitchen behind the house; they are so busy that who has time to open the front door?</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it's completely the opposite. Then you can boldly ring the doorbell at the front door or knock on the knocker. That's when most families are working or resting in the living room!</p>
<p>2.  A Timid Person is a Failed Person</p>
<p>Why should we "boldly" ring the doorbell or knock on the knocker? Because a timid person is a failed person!</p>
<p>Just think: if you ring or knock softly, will the people inside hear you? Even if they do hear you, judging by your timid manner, wouldn't the maid take you for a stranger? In this day and age, everyone is wary of strangers! When you are given the cold shoulder, would you hate the maid or hate yourself? Therefore, we must be bolder! Not only that, when the maid asks who it is from behind the door, you must answer kindly and loudly, as if you were a close relative or friend of the family. Naturally, they will open the door for you.</p>
<p>3.  How to Request an Audience with the Housewife?</p>
<p>The door is open. How to request an audience with the housewife? This cannot be generalized. There are many methods. First, you must remind yourself at this moment to be more intelligent, that is, to "adapt to the situation." For example, if you are in a household with a high level of education, it is appropriate to use our particularly large card. After the card is sent in, it will be welcomed by the housewife. Otherwise, that large card may be a bit intimidating. Another approach is to present some fabric samples. Those colorful books of fabric samples are very appealing. If you have the opportunity to explain your intentions to the maid, that would be even better.</p>
<p>4.  Seize Every Opportunity</p>
<p>Again, "adapting to the situation" is extremely important in interview work. Needless to say, if you see the housewife and notice that she has one or more children with her, you should start by talking about the children. If she is knitting with wool in her hands, you should discuss knitting patterns. This way, when the conversation becomes engaging, you can proceed to discuss national products, and the result will be universally beneficial. Not only that, for example, if you have entered someone's house, you can take advantage of someone who has just walked into the house and talk to them, which can invisibly help you overcome the difficulty of entering the house. Similarly, asking one or two children playing on the street or in the alley to lead you back to their home is also a good method. As for enthusiastic housewives who are willing to introduce you to acquaintances, it is an even greater success.</p>
<p>5.  Standing Before Proud Housewives</p>
<p>Naturally, most housewives are very receptive to our opinions. But standing before proud housewives is quite difficult to handle. At that time, you must generally say the following words to her humbly:</p>
<p>"My visit to your home this time is very presumptuous. There is also a belief behind bothering ladies like this, which is to work for national products. In order to make national products improve day by day, we must come to families and listen to the insightful opinions of ladies who are knowledgeable, experienced, and enthusiastically patriotic…"</p>
<p>Few people would not be moved by such words.</p>
<p>6.  How to Persuade Housewives with Limited Views?</p>
<p>"Promoting national products is an effective way to save the national economic crisis."</p>
<p>"Using national products is the natural duty of citizens." Slogans like these will lose their power to stimulate in the ears of housewives with limited views.</p>
<p>We need to make the slogans a bit more grounded. For example, say to her, "When Chinese people use Chinese goods, Chinese money can only be earned by Chinese people. If we buy foreign goods, isn't Chinese money being earned by foreigners?" Or, for example, "Two brothers, the Wang brothers. If the older brother's money is used by the younger brother, it is always used by people in the family. If it is used by Zhang San and Li Si, how can that be?" This kind of clever saying naturally has a great effect!</p>
<p>Interview Notes</p>
<h3 id="e181">An Interview with Mr. Chen Shoufeng <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xia</p>
<p>It was through the introduction of my friend Mr. Wang that I got to know Mr. Chen Shoufeng. If Mr. Wang hadn't explained, who would believe that such a young and solid person is actually an industrialist who has founded more than a dozen industries? After a round of pleasantries, our conversation began:</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, could you tell me about your motivation for founding a silk weaving business?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Hmm, the silk industry! No one would believe it, but I originally had no roots in the silk industry at all. The reason for founding it was that the Xiangchang Silk Factory, founded by my father's friend, Mr. Shi Shaochu, was not performing well and urgently needed someone to reorganize it. He repeatedly invited me to take on the position. At first, I was a bit apprehensive, but later I made up my mind with the principle that 'as long as I work hard, I won't be afraid of failure,' and I dared to accept the position of manager. Although I lost more than ten thousand yuan in the first year, by April and May of the following year, I had already earned back what I had lost, and the scope of the factory gradually expanded, and the capital also increased from fifty thousand yuan to one million yuan. Later, the output really couldn't meet the demand, so I decided on a material distribution system, but I didn't expect it would lead to the current situation of 'one factory every few steps.'" After saying this, he took a puff of smoke and smiled.</p>
<p>"What kind of businesses did Mr. Chen run before running the silk factory?"</p>
<p>"The dyeing and weaving factory and the toothbrush factory were both founded when I was around twenty years old. Later, I once cooperated with Mr. Liu Guojun in the dyeing and weaving business, but soon Mr. Liu went to Changzhou to open a yarn factory and had no time to take care of it, so the partnership dissolved implicitly. However, the factory still exists today."</p>
<p>"The toothbrush business is still an emerging industry in China, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when I founded the Zhenyu Toothbrush Factory, it was one of the only ones in China. At that time, I saw foreign toothbrushes flooding our country's market, and I aspired to establish a toothbrush factory. After more than a year of preparation, and with the strong support of my father, I was able to establish it. Although I lost more than 50,000 yuan in the short term, I felt very happy in spirit that foreign goods had disappeared. As for the fact that the toothbrush manufacturing industry has now become a small household industry, I never would have thought of it when I first started."</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, what are your opinions on running a glass business?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, that is very difficult to do. Take the Zhongshan Glass Factory, which I closed down last year, as an example. The business was very prosperous. Glass cups alone sold more than a thousand dozens a day. However, the workers' lack of knowledge prevented them from connecting with the factory, and it ultimately failed. Therefore, the lack of universal education is indeed very dangerous for the future of industry." Mr. Chen said unhappily.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's eloquence was very strong, and he became more energetic as he spoke. Before I knew it, we had been talking for more than a quarter of an hour. There were already two people waiting to discuss matters, so I bid farewell and left.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Future of National Product Development <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Recently, our national product industry has developed greatly. There is no doubt that this is indeed a fact. The production and sales of domestic products from January to July of this year—its sales volume has increased by more than one-third compared with the same period last year. At the same time, Chinese National Products Companies have been established in various places. Now there are as many as twelve, spread throughout the major cities of the country, gradually forming a network of national production and sales cooperation. This good phenomenon, on the one hand, demonstrates the upsurge of the national products movement, which has now gained the love of the vast majority of people in the country, and on the other hand, it demonstrates even more that it has laid the most solid foundation for the future of the entire national economic construction movement.</p>
<p>Although, at present, we should make a new estimate and a new review of the overall development prospects of national products. We need to know the reasons for the recent increase in sales of domestic products. What problems are still hindering its future? This is something that everyone engaged in national products should understand, as it is very necessary to develop future work.</p>
<p>Here, I think anyone with a slight understanding of the future of national products can immediately understand that the main reasons for the progress of national products this year are, first, the low domestic exchange rates and good harvests in various places, which promoted the increase in people's purchasing power, and second, the national product manufacturers' own efforts to promote sales, prices lower than foreign goods, and active promotion to Guangdong, Sichuan, and the Northwest. However, the biggest obstacle to its future is the obstruction of smuggling. Recently, there have been rumors that North China will levy a special tax on smuggled goods (only one-eighth of the customs duty), which will allow smuggled goods to openly and actively enter the domestic market. This is really a matter of life and death for our entire national product industry. We hope that it is not true, otherwise we will fight for it based on reason in order to find a solution.</p>
<p>Regarding the future development of national products, we must also strive for (1) progress in domestic transportation construction, so that national products can be easily transported and sold inland, (2) hope that the local authorities will abolish various special taxes that hinder the development of national products, so as to reduce the burden, and (3) should sincerely cooperate with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to open up overseas markets, so that national products can advance overseas.</p>
<p>In short, the future development of national products is very promising, as long as we all work harder in the future!</p>
<p>Brief news: The Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory in this city previously misused the name "Wanli Shoes" of the factory for industrial rubber, and sued according to the law. Later, through the mediation of Mr. Zhang Chuqiang and Mr. Wang Gongxian, it has come to an end, and the factory also, out of industry relations, could not bear to be harsh, and did not care about the losses suffered. Now the industrial factory, at the request of Zhengtai Factory, specially donated 200 yuan in legal currency to the museum for remittance to the anti-Japanese soldiers in Sui Province, to express condolences and encourage Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Production and Sales Should Correspond <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The failure of Chinese national product factories lies not in the dumping of foreign goods, but in the infighting among the same industry. For a certain product, it is clear that there is already a factory whose products are sufficient to meet the demand, but those who covet its profit, not knowing the importance, and without self-assessment, set up another factory to compete with it. For example, for a certain national product, the annual sales are 5 million yuan, and the existing factories have more than 5 million yuan of production, and there is already a feeling of oversupply, but a new force suddenly rises, and someone sets up another factory to join the competition. As a result, the newly established factory will inevitably suffer a miserable defeat, and the original factory, without exception, will still have lingering fears. Therefore, I often wish that national product factories should pay close attention to the overall problem, and there should be a method to consider the overall situation. And entrepreneurs who want to set up new factories should also carefully examine the pros and cons, and invest cautiously, and not just take a temporary small profit as a profit. Recently, the Minfeng Paper Factory, in order to count the current situation of domestic cigarette paper production and sales, advised the national entrepreneurs to invest cautiously. This matter is very much in line with our original intention, and is indeed a proof of the progress of the national product industry. At present, for cigarette paper production, the Minfeng Factory alone, if two machines are fully opened, has more than 840,000 rolls per year, while the domestic demand, including foreign merchants, is at most 740,000 rolls, which has become slightly surplus. According to this situation, cigarette paper production is sufficient to be self-sufficient. If a new factory is set up, the oversupply will be too much, and it will inevitably lead to a drop in prices and dumping, harming others and harming oneself. Rather than perish together, why not seek another way? There are many industries that should be run domestically, why must you go to the nationally produced products that have already been run by people and feel that they are oversupplied, to disrupt the market and bring about failure? There are many paths for my country's production industry, and we can examine the state of demand from the standpoint of the overall national economy, and carefully invest in the direction, and strive to make running an industry benefit the country, benefit the people, and make the society prosperous, and foreign goods will also disappear from this. Each additional factory like this will strengthen the country's strength and increase the vitality of society. In a nutshell: it is not difficult to start, but it lies in the ability to "correspond production and sales to suit supply and demand."</p>

<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>Talent is a bright and lustrous jade tablet, which needs to be ground and carved, and then nurtured with knowledge, so that talent can be used by people.</p>
<p>To unleash the greatness of talent, it is necessary to instill considerable knowledge to guide talent, and to strengthen the richness of knowledge, it is necessary to study considerable learning to develop talent.</p>
<p>The Analects of Confucius says: Hui could know ten things from hearing one, and Si could know two things from hearing one. The extent of talent in raising one and reversing one, and raising one and grasping three, can be derived from here as a touchstone.</p>
<p>The pouring of spring water must have a smooth flowing river channel, and the cultivation of talents must have a beautiful and good education. A long-stored mirror needs to be wiped to be bright, and a long-hidden moon needs to have the veil swept away to be dazzling.</p>
<p>Talent will sometimes automatically flow outward, but automatic leakage is easy to run into the wrong path, and passive guidance will go on the right track.</p>
<p>Look at Chinese society, there are too many people being eroded, one is due to improper use, and the other is due to improper use of talent. The obstruction and stagnation of social undertakings are indeed due to the fact that the volatility of talent comes too immature and decadent.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Daughter in the Ji Family Inn <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Bao</p>
<p>In the eleventh year of the Republic of China—I, with my aunt and uncle, went from Bozhou, Anhui, to South Suzhou, taking the Jinpu train back to Jiangsu. On the way from Bozhou to Suzhou, we suddenly heard that there was a bandit alarm thirty miles ahead, so we had to stay in Qinglugou, a place bordering Jiangsu and Anhui. It was the only Ji Family Inn. Needless to say, the equipment was simple. At that time, we originally planned to stay for one night and leave, but the bandits ahead were fighting each other day after day, so we had to spend day after day at the Ji Family Inn. After enduring until the fifth day, in the early morning, there was a commotion in the backyard. My aunt was awakened from her sleep. Suddenly she could not find my uncle, so she ran to the next room to look for him. I hurriedly got up, put on my clothes, and went to the backyard, only to see my uncle and a girl tied back-to-back, placed on the kang. I knew that girl, she was the daughter of the Ji Family Inn. Although her skin was quite fair, and her feet were quite small (at that time, in the rural areas there, women still regarded small feet as beautiful), but those cross-eyes had already caught my attention on the first day.</p>
<p>At that time, five burly men were standing in front of the kang, menacingly, trying to send my uncle to the authorities, saying that he had sexually assaulted a maiden. Later, they learned about my relationship with my uncle, so they turned around and threatened me. At that time, I was so frightened that I was stunned and didn't know what to do. In the end, it was still my uncle who negotiated with them himself, settled it with forty-six strings of cash, and regained his freedom. Coincidentally, that day at noon, the old rickshaw puller said that it was already calm ahead, so we left the Ji Family Inn in a disheveled state. When the cart pulled out of Qinglugou, the five burly men who had been seen in the morning, their faces flushed from drinking, came towards us. The old rickshaw puller laughed and said, "You made a good deal." One of them replied, "What a good deal, our five brothers only got a net of eight strings of cash." After the five men passed, the old rickshaw puller, with intermittent sentences, told us that the daughter in the Ji Family Inn only did these "honey trap" stories. So all the way, my uncle was scolded by my aunt until they reached Suzhou.</p>
<p>Less than five years after returning to the village, my aunt and uncle passed away one after another. This farcical drama also gradually dissipated in my mind like smoke. Unexpectedly, in the past month, a family pulling a rickety cart moved into the bungalow opposite my Shanghai residence. One day, I suddenly heard my maid chatting with the woman from that family, and the woman said that she was from Qinglugou, Anhui. My heart fluttered, I looked carefully, the outline was vaguely familiar, and those cross-eyes were still unharmed. So I couldn't help but exclaimed, "You are the daughter in the Ji Family Inn." Hearing this, her face flushed, and she walked away pretending not to hear. From then on, when she saw me, she avoided me from afar. Last week, she moved away silently.</p>
<p>More than ten years have passed, and she has aged so much that she doesn't look like a middle-aged woman, and she is already the mother of five children. But how did she drift into this city? This is a mystery, perhaps it will never be known to me.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Street Manufacturers <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>The people kneading dough are hailed as street artists, but I have found many street industrialists on the street. At the entrance of my alley, there are many stalls. First, let's talk about the so-called "cigarette company" without a signboard. That is a beggar-like man, squatting on the ground, rolling cigarettes. He manufactures them with a wooden cigarette rolling machine that is extremely simple and has a belt strung in the middle. He puts tobacco shreds on the belt, and then places cigarette paper with glue on it, then gently pushes it upwards, and a cigarette rolls out. Although this is made by hand, because his technique is skillful, he can manufacture about four hundred cigarettes a day. Although he earns three small coins on each one, the price is still cheaper than ordinary discount cigarettes, so workers and shop assistants living nearby are all his regular customers every day. Every day, four hundred cigarettes, he doesn't need to worry about overproduction at all.</p>
<p>The second one should be the one hanging "Biscuit King" on the stall. However, this biscuit manufacturing is very ridiculous. Although his signboard is the Biscuit King, what he makes and sells, he says himself, is egg slices. But in reality, the raw materials he uses absolutely do not have eggs. What he uses are really sugar and flour for making biscuits, mixed with some water. His manufacturing equipment is two pairs of irons and a charcoal furnace. On the iron, he scoops a spoonful of flour slurry, closes the iron, and puts it on the furnace to bake. Then he starts scooping the slurry onto the second iron. When the second iron is placed on the furnace and the first iron is replaced, the so-called "egg slice" inside has already matured. Making it in this never ending cycle, he can make five or six hundred pieces a day. These five or six hundred pieces are completely sold to the children in the alley. The price is five pennies per piece, and twenty pennies for five pieces. His profit is three pennies on one penny. But if you only buy two pieces from him, he has a profit of four pennies.</p>
<p>There is also a flatbread stall. To put it grandly, it is simply a flatbread company boss for the common people, who has changed to making and selling so-called "hygienic soda" and "hygienic fresh orange juice." His signboard is the three characters "Wang Guangli," but this is irrelevant, because eight or nine out of ten of his customers are illiterate. His hygienic soda is cold boiled water with sugar juice and baking soda. A half-foot-tall bottle, ten pennies for three bottles. Fresh orange juice uses orange juice fruit syrup instead of baking soda, forty pennies per bottle. A thriving career. At the hottest time, he can earn about two thousand pennies a day, because he puts some ice shavings in the hygienic soda and fresh orange juice, so it is very popular with customers.</p>
<p>These, although the scale is so simple that it is not worth mentioning, but calling them street manufacturers, I think it is worthy of the name.</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Vowing Hearts in Water and Talking Sadly in Green Lamps, Reporting Lovesickness with Gilded Fingers and Red Beans</p>
<p>Guoqi looked at the letter on the table, neither telling Youmei to take it away, nor stopping her. Youmei slowly walked to the edge of the table, held the small envelope in her hand, gently tossed it up and down, and smiled: I can't guess what's in here. Guoqi smiled: This is nothing more than sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the affection is heavy. When Youmei heard this sentence, she saw through his meaning. Looking at the four characters "Forever to be Good" written on the envelope, she smiled and nodded at the paper bag. Guoqi said: This is an idiom I used from the Book of Songs. "He gives me a peach, I give him a jade pendant in return. It is not a return, but forever to be good." Originally, it was a bit incomprehensible for me to quote these words. The gold ring that people sent is a thousand times more valuable than a peach. The two red beans I sent to people are even a thousand times worse than jade. I don't stress the three characters that it is not a return. Youmei ignored this, and smiled: I'll take it away. Guoqi nodded: You're too enthusiastic. Youmei said: Just now my cousin said that he doesn't need this kind of souvenir anymore, I'm a little unconvinced. When I see him later, I'll see if he needs it. Guoqi said: I feel that my treatment of friends is sincere. As for whether friends can understand, I dare not say. Youmei stood still, but leaned half of her body and looked at him, smiling: Cousin, I'm leaving, do you have anything else to say? Guoqi said: I don't have anything to say. Saying these words, he also looked at her. Seeing that the white powder rubbed on her cheeks was already showing moisture, she had been sitting upright for a long time, and she had not prepared a fan for others, and she was a little sweaty. He held the folding fan with both hands, and arched it high: I'm sorry to trouble you. Youmei smiled: Are we still being polite? Cousin! In the sound of her calling him "cousin," she nodded and left in a hurry. When she passed by in front of him, a faint fragrance still fell on her body. Guoqi couldn't help but feel a little about her, feeling that compared to Menglan, they were simply two different people, but she was very willing to help her friends, which was rare. He didn't know if Menglan could help him in this way if she was in this situation. It's just that she is a very quiet person who is shy to see people, so she probably can't be so straightforward and neat. Because of this, he suffered from this point of gentle nature.</p>

<p>During this time of national crisis, all unnecessary construction should be stopped, people believe. For example, the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou certainly need not be rebuilt, and even the Leifeng Pagoda need not be planned for reconstruction just because it collapsed.</p>
<p>Now, the Arhat Hall of Lingyin Temple has been carelessly burned down and is about to be rebuilt. It's careless to begin with, and wasteful afterwards, truly pointless.</p>
<p>Indulging in dance halls is surely ignorant of the sorrows of national subjugation, but using precious money to squander on emptiness in these difficult times, what real benefit does it bring to the country? It would be better to buy a bomber for several hundred thousand yuan, to save the people from the great calamity, that would be more charitable. (Lan Ren)</p>

<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Legend has it that a tiger's tail has a fishy smell. When hungry, it dangles its tail by the river to lure fish for food. Unexpectedly, such a large creature, accommodates its hunger with small pickings, sometimes even resulting in death from a small mouth. Near the river mouth at the Yuezhou city wall, a tiger was dangling its tail to lure fish, when a large turtle happened to pass by in the water. Smelling the fishy scent, it suddenly poked its head out of the water and bit the tiger's tail, holding on tightly. The tiger was in great pain and quickly jumped up, accidentally falling into the crenellations of the city wall. The tiger was inside the crenellations, the turtle was outside, looking like a load being carried on a pole. The tiger thrashed its tail even faster in pain, and the turtle bit even tighter in fright. Someone saw it from under the city wall and managed to catch them both. Then, that person slaughtered the tiger but released the turtle into the river, rewarding it for its service in capturing the tiger.</p>

<p>— Man Ling</p>
<p>The sky is dark and gloomy, and people say, "Winter has arrived."</p>
<p>In the city, the chimneys of furnaces are gradually emerging from the windows of the capitalists, arranged high and low in the pale gray sky. The young ladies go to dance halls, wearing fur coats and high-heeled leather shoes, sitting in streamlined cars, with boyfriends snuggling beside them, the car cutting through the northwest wind, speeding forward. Winter? Is it really winter? The wealthy don't know that winter has arrived!</p>
<p>The northwest wind howls, the heavy snow flies, wearing steel helmets, single-layered shoes, holding guns, dragging cannons, marching forward! Charging! The soldiers fighting bandits on the front lines, only knowing to bring honor to the country and protect the people, how would they know that winter has arrived?</p>

<p>A friend of mine is fond of gambling, and there isn't a day that he doesn't play mahjong. Since the fake bandits invaded Suiyuan, when the news arrived, the entire nation was filled with indignation. Donations poured in from all over, and emotions were high. My friend was also moved by this. He told me the other day that although he cannot quit gambling immediately, he will use his gambling funds to meet the needs of saving the nation. Every time he gambles, he will extract a portion, several yuan for large games, several jiao for smaller ones, and donate all of this money to relieve Suiyuan. If he does this every day for a month, the amount will be considerable, he said. I heard this and couldn't name it, so I named it to tell gambling addicts that they could imitate him.</p>

<p>It's rare to find kindred spirits in this floating life. I remember discussing poetry under the lamp and critiquing paintings by the window.

<p>Achievements and failures were ultimately due to food and clothing. The cuckoo cries its heart out, the phoenix's shadow separates and flies away.

<h3 id="e194">Gender Transformation (Part Two) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Ming</p>
<p>Because these kinds of male-to-female and female-to-male transformations happen so often, the Olympic Committee has often been at a loss when gender issues arise with female athletes in the games; therefore, a new chapter has been drafted, stipulating that in the future, athletes must undergo medical examinations before participating in competitions.</p>
<p>Medical research has found that this kind of gender transformation is related to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are about two inches in size, flat and semi-circular, brownish-yellow in color, attached to the upper front surface of the kidneys, without ducts, directly secreting substances into the bloodstream; when they are healthy, they have a very important relationship with sexual development. When they are not healthy, they can change the skin of women into the rough, hairy skin of men, they can also change the gentle female voice into a low and coarse male voice, causing her to dislike men and reverse her love and hate.</p>
<p>If the two adrenal glands of an animal are removed, it will die after forty-eight hours. This proves that the adrenal glands are also essential organs for life.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, a female patient came to Charing Cross Hospital in London. Her symptoms were: facial hair growth, body contours becoming closer to those of a man, such as broad shoulders, and enlarged pelvis; excessive development of bones and muscles; rough skin; deep voice; immature development of sexual organs; underdeveloped breasts; and a change in psychological concept towards men. After abdominal dissection, it was found that one adrenal gland was enlarged. During the first surgery, surgeon and adrenal gland specialist Lennox Ross Broster removed the enlarged adrenal gland, and the hair on the woman's face and arms immediately disappeared, her voice returned to a female tone, and her previously flat breasts became fuller.</p>
<p>This discovery and treatment are all thanks to Dr. Broster, who is still diligently researching this topic. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Past and Present of China's Embassy in Japan <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>China and Japan are only separated by a narrow strip of water, and their relationship is the closest, so the history of international negotiations between the two countries is also the longest. Recently, with the adjustment of national relations, the platitude of cooperation and friendship has once again been much talked about, and as a result, China's embassy in Japan has been drawing more intense attention.</p>
<p>China's embassy in Japan is located in the Azabu district of Tokyo, near the embassies of Italy and the Soviet Union, which can be said to be the center of Japanese diplomacy. The Qing Dynasty first sent He Ruzhang as the first minister to Japan in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign. Later, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the entire embassy lowered its flag and returned to the country. After the establishment of the Republic, Ma Tingliang was appointed minister to Japan in the second year of the Republic. Jiang Zuobin went to Japan as minister to Japan in the nineteenth year of the Republic, and later, in October of last year, Jiang was promoted to ambassador to Japan. Jiang's term has been two or three years, the longest time stationed in Japan. The current Xu Shiying came to Japan in mid-April of this year.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see the Chinese national flag in Japan. Although among the flags of all nations at ordinary gatherings, there is also our Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong (Blue Sky White Sun Red Earth) flag, not only are the dimensions incorrect, but the number of points may also be wrong. There is a huge party emblem on the iron gate of our embassy, and the three-colored national flag of blue, white, and red flies in the skies of the Japanese empire. Besides the embassy, perhaps only the roof of the Student Supervision Office has the qualification to hang the national flag. In the foreign legation district of Dongjiaomin Lane in Beiping, all foreign embassies have troops stationed there, but outside the gate of our embassy in Japan, there is a Japanese policeman stationed, questioning guests who are visiting the ambassador. It is said that in the past, due to certain reasons, the embassy requested the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department to set up this gate post, and it has been a tradition ever since, and has not yet been removed.</p>
<p>The building of the embassy was originally the villa of Marquis Tokugawa Yorinori, and has now been rebuilt into a two-story Western-style building. Outside is a simple garden, very much like a small rural residence in Europe and America. In the ambassador's reception room upstairs, the decorations are full of Japanese flavor. Several Fujian lacquer vases decorate the room in a very quiet way. On the wall, there are no Chinese paintings or calligraphy, only a huge Xiang embroidery, which is a colorful tiger. I remember that in the past, the French Tiger Prime Minister and our Chinese Little Cat representative became famous stories in the diplomatic world. Indeed, our China now lacks tiger diplomacy to break the international crisis.</p>
<p>During the great earthquake in Japan, many overseas Chinese in Yokohama and Tokyo were killed. At that time, the embassy did not have accurate statistics on overseas Chinese, and it was impossible to investigate for a while. Now, in addition to the students being managed by the Student Supervision Office, the embassy also manages overseas Chinese affairs. Last month, due to national election matters, they were busy investigating the situation of overseas Chinese, which is very different from before. Japanese magazines say that among the eleven embassies of various countries in Japan, the Soviet and Chinese embassies are the most active, which is something only heaven knows.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Shanghai-Guangdong Telephone Communication <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's construction industry has made rapid progress, especially in the development of transportation. Long-distance telephone occupies an important position in transportation. With the active management of the Ministry of Communications, and years of construction, it keeps pace with the times, and the telephone communication reaches all locations, no matter how far. The Nine-Province Telephone Network has been successfully connected, and the Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Guangdong wireless telephones have also been officially opened for business one after another. Using wireless radio for long-distance conversations domestically is truly a first. However, Shanghai-Hankou still has wired telephone that can directly connect, while Shanghai-Guangdong does not. Therefore, the public's hope for telephone communication between Shanghai and Guangdong is more urgent than that for Shanghai-Hankou. Now that it has been achieved, the people of both places can use it for conversation, as if they were face to face, and their joy is beyond description!</p>
<p>It is also possible to erect copper wires and set up repeater stations between Shanghai and Guangdong for wired telephone communication, but the route is long, winding, and full of high mountains and ridges, making construction very difficult. Moreover, the demand for pole and wire materials is large, and the factory costs are huge, which is not permitted by the current economy. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications plans to first set up telephone stations in Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangdong, and install telephone equipment for mutual connection, so that in the midst of economic considerations, the convenience of free response can still be achieved. Wired and wireless are originally one, complementing each other, and the effect is more obvious. When we first tried the Shanghai-Guangdong wireless telephone, listening to the clarity of the voice and feeling the perfection of the reception, it was really no different from wired telephone communication.</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong is rich in resources, and its politics and commerce occupy an important position in the country. In the past, due to the obstruction of mountains and the poor transportation, it was easy for Middle Wu (Jiangsu and Zhejiang area) and the local areas to be estranged. As a result, warlords took the opportunity to seize power and monopolize Southern Guangdong, and the national territory seemed to be in a separate state, another world. With the communication of this wireless radio, the so-called Southern Guangdong is just in the same room. Conversation is convenient, and accumulated feelings can be expressed. What more estrangement of opinions can there be?</p>
<h3 id="e197">Around Christmas <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Han Shui</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and this year's Christmas is coming again in the blink of an eye. Although Christmas is a Western festival, once Christmas has passed, the New Year is approaching. Christmas and the New Year are only a few days apart, so celebrating Christmas and New Year's greetings are often linked and inseparable.</p>
<p>Those who are good at socializing will certainly not let Christmas and New Year pass easily. Before Christmas, they often prepare how to extend greetings between the two places to express mutual feelings. Thus, they either send gifts, or greeting cards, or, for more grand occasions, send Christmas and New Year's telegrams.</p>
<p>Using telegrams to congratulate the New Year is a common social practice in Western countries. They believe that sending just a printed card to close relatives and friends who live far apart, signing one's own name, seems too simple and not enough to express warm sincerity. Therefore, they abandon the use of cards and use telegrams instead. These New Year's telegrams are handwritten and signed very solemnly. If they are sent to and arrive in a remote place, they can use facsimile telegrams, and they must be delivered by facsimile so that the person receiving the New Year's greetings can see their handwriting in person, as if they were seeing the person in person, which of course can bring great joy.</p>
<p>Those who travel between Christmas and the New Year especially hope that close relatives and friends will send New Year's telegrams so that they can find some comfort in the lonely journey. Therefore, ships sailing in the ocean often receive many telegrams from wireless machines around December 25, congratulating passengers. Passengers on long journeys often read and reread telegrams from relatives, friends, or loved ones, reluctant to let go, leaving a very deep impression in their minds.</p>
<p>In addition, those who have contacts with people abroad, or those who have business relationships, on the occasion of this grand Christmas and New Year, mutual congratulations cannot be expressed without telegrams. If it is just a card, delivered far away by mail, it is not only delayed, but the recipient will also regard it as ordinary and not value it. In short, Christmas and New Year's telegrams have their wonderful use, and can never be equated with a piece of card.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Respectful Announcement to City Telephone Subscribers and Long-Distance Telephone Callers <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Ronghai</p>
<p>When managing a certain business, certain disputes are bound to occur. This is not a bad phenomenon of poor business management, but a trend that is unavoidable in the business process. The same is true for managing the telephone business. However, once such disputes are explained, both parties can understand. Now, let me try to explain it as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding City Telephones, there are the following two types:</p>
<p>(1) Disputes regarding the operator's reply of "wait a moment" (referring to non-automatic telephones) – Every time a subscriber encounters a situation where they call a certain number, and the operator replies "wait a moment", they often mistakenly believe that the operator is deliberately making things difficult, and express a bad impression. How can it be known that in the aspect of the operator, the connection between the two telephones is just a matter of inserting the plug, so why make things difficult? When they call a certain number, if there is already a plug in the port of that number, it means that the number is already talking to another subscriber, so how can it be connected again? Once this type of dispute is explained, it will be clear. It is the same with automatic telephones, that when a certain number is talking to another number, it cannot be connected to other numbers.</p>
<p>(2) Disputes regarding subscribers not reporting the number but only calling the name of the household (referring to non-automatic telephones) – Some subscribers do not want to search for the number of the called subscriber in the phone book, and only call the name of the household for connection. In the operator's aspect, they must ask the subscriber to report the number in order to comply with the regulations. Because the operator's mind cannot memorize so many subscriber numbers. As a result, the subscriber thinks that the operator is not courteous, and complaint letters flood in. However, it is not known that the printing and distribution of the phone book by the bureau is for each subscriber to look up the numbers. Now, they abandon the phone book and only report the household name. I ask, can the operator's memory be so extensive? It is the same with automatic telephones, if they do not know the number of the called party, can they dial it and connect? Therefore, it is an inappropriate habit for the calling subscriber to only report the household name. It should be removed in order to avoid this unnecessary dispute.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Long-Distance Telephones, there are also the following two types:</p>
<p>(1) Calculation of Call Time – Long-distance callers often have disputes over the calculation of call time: for example, if the bureau thinks that five minutes should be counted as two charges, they will insist that it has not reached three minutes and should be counted as one charge. This kind of dispute is indeed a normal human emotion, but they do not know that the bureau calculates the time completely impartially. Moreover, state-run enterprises are far from comparable to other commercial enterprises that only aim at trade profits. All kinds of regulations are announced by law, how can the bureau arbitrarily change them? Moreover, for a long-distance telephone call, both the caller and the receiver must register the time. How can the bureau's staff arbitrarily increase or decrease the time and commit a crime against the regulations? However, this kind of dispute also has its considerable main reason, because when the caller is paying attention to the conversation, they do not realize that the time has passed so quickly. They think that they have only talked a few sentences, so how can it have already been four or five minutes? But the bureau staff should be trusted, and they will never arbitrarily increase or decrease the time. Therefore, some callers sometimes insist on asking the bureau for evidence of the duration of the call, which is an unavoidable factor in disputes. Regarding this point, the ministry is now trying to adopt a time-stamping machine, which will surely satisfy the callers.</p>
<p>(2) Disputes over Waiting for Connection – On busy lines, callers become anxious and angry due to the long wait for connection, and there are many complaints, even those who roar in the waiting area! Regarding this point, it is indeed a phenomenon that occurs because the country's construction has not yet fully developed, which causes inconvenience to the public. However, the ups and downs of business are like the tides, sometimes one line is enough to cope with the demand, and sometimes even ten lines are not enough. Therefore, the waiting for connection of callers is a phenomenon that exists in all countries. Fortunately, the current regulations stipulate that if it exceeds two hours, the number can be cancelled free of charge. If it can be connected within these two hours, it is already a good phenomenon of today's material civilization. We really don't need to be anxious and angry, and still complain that we have been waiting for too long. If there is really no time to wait, you may as well send a telegram instead, which is also a remedy. I sincerely hope that callers and receivers will have a deep understanding of this point.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Issue of Cancelling Long-Distance Telephone Numbers <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>Telephone bureaus or telegraph bureaus that also handle long-distance telephones (hereinafter referred to as the "telephone bureau") may cancel a caller's registered number, due to their request or because the long-distance call could not be connected, and may charge or exempt the caller from a cancellation fee, depending on the circumstances. Detailed regulations are already in place in the current "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" of the Ministry of Communications, which are explained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Situations in which a cancellation fee should be charged according to regulations:</p>
<p>(A) The called party should be rung up – If the long-distance telephone number of a certain place is dialed, after the calling bureau connects to the receiving bureau, the receiving bureau rings up the city telephone of the called party, but the called subscriber does not answer or deliberately does not answer, the fault is not with the telephone bureau. Therefore, if the call cannot be connected due to the above situation, the number should be cancelled immediately, and the caller should pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(B) The designated telephone number is vacant – If the long-distance telephone subscriber designates the other party's telephone number, and the receiving bureau confirms that the number is indeed vacant and cannot be connected, the telephone bureau is not responsible. Therefore, the caller must pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations for this registered number that could not be connected.</p>
<p>(C) Calls that the telephone bureau cannot relay – If the caller designates the address of the called party, and the receiving bureau sends someone to relay the call to the address, but the called party cannot be relayed because the address is wrong or incomplete, the telephone bureau has fulfilled its responsibility to relay the call. Therefore, if the caller receives a notification from the telephone bureau that the called party cannot be relayed, and the call cannot be connected, they must pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(D) The called party is not called, or does not wish to answer – If the caller designates the called party, and the receiving bureau sends someone to the called party's address as stated by the calling bureau. If both the called party and their designated representative are away on business, and no one comes to answer the call, or if the called party does not wish to answer the call from the calling party, the caller must pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations if they are notified by the telephone bureau that the called party could not be called or does not wish to answer the call, resulting in the call not being able to be connected.</p>
<p>(E) The caller does not answer – After the caller registers with the telephone bureau to call a long-distance number from a city telephone or private line, the receiving bureau has already called the called party, and the calling bureau has also rung the calling party's city or private line telephone, but the calling party is away on urgent business, so they are unable to answer the telephone bureau's return call; or if the caller has been notified by the telephone bureau that the called party has been called, but suddenly does not wish to answer the call for some reason, resulting in the call not being able to be connected, they should immediately pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(F) The called party delays answering – If the called party of a long-distance telephone call does not go to answer the call within one hour of receiving notification from the telephone bureau, the telephone bureau will cancel the number immediately and collect a cancellation fee from the caller according to the regulations.</p>
<p>(G) The address of the called party is too far from the telephone bureau – According to Article 5 of the current "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" of the Ministry of Communications, relayed calls are limited to those where the called party is within the business area of the telephone bureau, and for those without a fixed business area, the limit is 3 kilometers from the bureau. If the receiving bureau confirms that the address of the called party designated by the caller for a relayed call exceeds the above-mentioned distance, the receiving bureau will not be able to send someone to relay the call, and therefore the caller must also pay the cancellation fee according to the regulations if the call cannot be connected.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned circumstances in which the called party and the caller cannot connect are extremely complex, the reasons are nothing more than that one of the called or calling parties is unable to come to answer the call, or does not wish to answer the call. Since the telephone bureau has fulfilled its responsibility to call and relay the call, it is not responsible, so the current "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" of the Ministry of Communications stipulates that if any of the above-mentioned circumstances occur, the telephone bureau may cancel the number and collect a cancellation fee from the caller.</p>
<p>(2) Situations in which cancellation fees are waived according to regulations:</p>
<p>(A) Telephone line damage – After the caller informs the telephone bureau of the called location name, telephone number or the name and address of the called party, the type of call, and the caller’s telephone number and address, if the calling bureau experiences an obstruction of the long-distance telephone or the phone equipment, which causes them not to connect to the receiving bureau and receiving party, the caller may request the cancellation of the number, and the cancellation fee will be waived. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e200">New Long-Distance Telephone Regulations Effective This Month <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Cancellation Methods Are Stipulated. There are Eleven Improvement Points.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' newly revised "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" will officially come into effect on the first of this month. This new regulation has many improvements. The differences between this regulation and the old regulation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When a long-distance telephone's receiver is called and is in the midst of a city telephone call, the receiving bureau can seek the receiver's approval and interrupt their city telephone call, and connect the long-distance phone call.</p>
<p>(2) The old regulation's long-distance call that dials to a certain place and certain number without specifying the individual receiving the call has been renamed to "Dialing Number Call". The old regulation's long-distance phone call that dials to a certain place and certain number, specifying that a certain individual is receiving, was named the "Pre-informed Telephone" and has been renamed the "Dialing Individual Call". Callers can understand and recognize phone call types now with this determination of "Dialing Number" and "Dialing Individual". Additionally, the old regulation's "Pre-arranged Phone Call" is renamed "Scheduled Telephone" and is being actively enacted.</p>
<p>(3) The old regulation stated that for "Pre-informed Telephone" calls, ordinary rates must be added by 1/3, and to relay or forward for "Forwarding Phone Call", a specially appointed fee of 1 jiao was required. The new regulations state that the cost for forwarding the telephone is the same as the dialing individual telephone, and there is no appointed individual cost.</p>
<p>(4) The new regulations' Cancellation Fees are cheaper than in the old regulations, and less than 1/3 of the ordinary dialing rate.</p>
<p>(5) The regulations for Ordinary Telephone Costs are for dialing. The costs for Relay phone calls, Dialing Individual phone calls, and Cancellation costs must be checked in the categorized cost comparison charts to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>(7) Forwarding distances are limited to 3 kilometers away, decreasing from 2 kilometers prior, and the appointed forwarding costs are cancelled.</p>
<p>(8) Callers may change the type of phone call before receiving the notification for calls received. This is limited to changing ordinary phone calls to urgent ones, and changing dialing numbers to dialing an individual.</p>
<p>(9) Callers dialing individual calls can specify an alternate for the individual that is being dialed.</p>
<p>(10) Due to line congestion after a dialing registration, a waiting period of 2 hours for an ordinary call is required (previously, it was four hours), and a waiting period of 1 hour is required for an urgent call (previously, two hours) to receive a free cancellation.</p>
<p>(11) In busy circumstances, the limitation for continuous calls is limited to a maximum of 3 times.</p>
<p>The improvements above are to procedures or the cost adjustments, and all improvements for long-distance phone services.</p>

<p>— Small Offering</p>
<p>Reality—A telegram sent from Shanghai is delivered by the sender to the telegraph office, undergoes registration, transmission, reception, delivery, and other procedures, and ultimately reaches the recipient in Nanjing. The time taken is less than fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Ideal—A telegram sent from Shanghai to Hankou, considering the distance, it would be expected to take at least an hour. A reply telegram would likely take several hours.</p>
<p>Reality—The telegram reaches the recipient in Hankou in just over ten minutes. A reply telegram is delivered within an hour.</p>
<p>Result—Reality exceeds expectations. The distance between the two places is not a reliable measure of the speed of telegram transmission. Common assumptions sometimes prove incorrect. The reason? Both Shanghai-Hankou and Nanjing-Shanghai have direct lines, allowing for direct operation, and communication is equally convenient.</p>

<p>Although German literature has a very long history, its true maturity came after the seventeenth century, and its worldwide reputation, shining for generations, was truly achieved by the classical literary arts of the eighteenth century. Strictly speaking, their literature has only occupied a major place in the history of world literature for about one or two hundred years. Among the figures who contributed the most during this period were the so-called Six Great Poetic Heroes. Among them, besides Lessing, Wieland, and Goethe, Schiller was one of the founding members.</p>
<p>In Europe, German poetry always maintains the greatest honor. As for drama, especially tragedy and poetic drama, few other countries can compete. If one has an intention to delve into German literature, one must grasp these two subjects. Even if you only want to glimpse the outline of their literature, the drama of the eighteenth century is a must-know department. When it comes to the drama of this period, in addition to Goethe's Faust, Schiller's complete works occupy a completely important position.</p>
<p>Schiller (Friedrich Schiller, 1759-1805) was a natural poet, rich in reason, and good at contemplation. His plays have a rigorous structure and detailed content. He is generally regarded as Germany's greatest playwright. Although his poetic talent is slightly inferior to Goethe, his plays always surpass those of the poetic heroes—this is a consensus among critics.</p>
<p>Schiller's famous plays total nine, which can be arranged in the following order according to the date of publication: (1) The Robbers (Die Räuber); (2) Fiesco's Conspiracy (Die Verschwörung des Fiesco); (3) Intrigue and Love (Kabale und Liebe); (4) Don Carlos; (5) Wallenstein; (6) Maria Stuart; (7) The Maid of Orleans (Die Jungfrau von Orleans); (8) The Bride of Messina (Die Braut von Messina); (9) William Tell (Wilhelm Tell).</p>
<p>From this, we can know that among Schiller's plays, William Tell is the last one. Because the author's skills became more proficient and his thoughts matured, this play, once produced, was almost beyond criticism. Not only can it not be matched in the German classical school, but it is also difficult to find a selection in modern world drama. Because it has the most suitable qualities for performance, it is still a popular script on the stage.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Schiller's works often have slightly profound words and sentences, and several plays are overly tinged with melancholy. Therefore, J. Macy has the following remarks in his A Story of World Literature:</p>
<p>"...criticism of its rhetoric and frequently found sentimentality is common... but the most beautiful plays, such as William Tell... are still vibrant, the lively things at the bottom of the play..."—according to Hu Zhongchi's translation.</p>
<p>Indeed, no matter how you nitpick Schiller's works, the greatness of William Tell cannot be denied by anyone.</p>
<p>William Tell is a historical tragedy, taken from a story in Swiss independence. When the Habsburg imperial family of Germany ruled over the areas of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden, their appointed governor, Gessler, was a brutal and merciless man. He led a group of officials to implement various oppressive policies in Switzerland, causing the people to completely lose the freedom they considered inherent. Thus, a torch of revolution was waved among farmers, workers, and slaves. With the determination to unite against foreign aggression, they victoriously restored their freedom, expelled the tyrannical officials, and completed the foundation of independence.</p>
<p>In this play, William Tell appears as a strong, heroic, loving, and peaceful person. Relying on his skilled arrows and strong physique, he rescues his oppressed compatriots everywhere, and finally establishes the greatest achievement in fighting for freedom—assassinating Gessler. He originally had no old grudges against the rulers, and even respected the officials very much. It is said that once when he was hunting and passing through a wilderness, with no one around, Gessler suddenly came face to face alone. At this time, Gessler showed a look of surprise towards this enemy who had been severely punished for a minor offense, but the official therefore harbored a determination to kill him. When the people rose up in unison, he finally chose this most difficult and important task for justice and freedom. Undoubtedly, in this play, Schiller truly symbolizes the Swiss national spirit with this personality—neither resistant nor humble, upholding the middle path and following righteousness.</p>
<p>In China during this extraordinary period, I believe that there are still very few things that are suitable for every patriotic people to recite and can be as beautiful and cordial as this. Furthermore, only the Chinese of our time most need and can understand all the meanings in this play. It depicts the psychology of traitors, the ferocious faces of invaders, and their means of oppression. At the same time, it not only instructs us with a correct understanding, encourages our courage, and excites our souls, but finally, I hope that all people who "do not want to be slaves" can appreciate this great creation.</p>

<p>— Ruo Yin</p>
<p>Stories of National Crisis · Shi Ying · Kaiming Bookstore Publishing · Price 35 cents</p>
<p>A few days ago, my younger brother wrote to me from school, asking me to choose a few supplementary reading materials on history and geography for him. Yesterday afternoon, I took advantage of my free time to buy a copy of "Stories of National Crisis," recently published by Kaiming Bookstore, intending to send it to my younger brother. Last night, when I was about to go to bed, I leaned on the pillow and casually flipped through this book. Unexpectedly, as soon as I opened it, the author's sincere and passionate feelings for his own country and clear and simple writing style captured my attention, making me unconsciously read this small book in one breath within three hours. After reading it, I felt extremely moved. What I cannot forget the most are the following passages:</p>
<p>"...The incompetent officials in charge of foreign affairs in China were single-mindedly afraid and naturally complied with every request. As a result, China suffered great losses just in the treaties on paper. However, at that time, the Chinese people, because they had only just come into contact with foreign countries, had not yet forgotten their position and were still unwilling to obediently be slaves to other countries. Unlike those traitors who do not know what shame is, they are extremely respectful to foreigners, being more careful than a pug serving its master..."—Lecture 3, "Foreign Troops First Invade the Capital."</p>
<p>"Although China's officialdom and weapons were useless, it was not as easy as they thought for foreign troops to attack the capital. Unfortunately, when the Allied Forces attacked Tianjin and Beijing, only a few Chinese troops in the north resisted the enemy. Most of the troops were fighting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the south, busy killing their own hungry brothers, and did not have time to rescue the north from the foreign troops' attack. Therefore, the Anglo-French Allied Forces easily advanced north..."—Ibid.</p>
<p>What the author describes is the situation seventy or eighty years ago, but is this situation in our country limited to seventy or eighty years ago?</p>
<p>"Japan is in the sea east of China, surrounded by clear sea waves. The fan-shaped Mount Fuji and the brilliant cherry blossoms show her natural scenery everywhere. Therefore, in ancient China, Japan was regarded as Penglai Island, where immortal beings lived, and there were also infatuated emperors who sent envoys there to visit the immortals. The immortals' elixir of immortality was not found, but most of Japan's culture was transmitted from China... Recently, European and American powers came to the East and forced the Eastern countries to open their doors to do business. Japan, like China, did not welcome them, but because their military force was not as good as theirs, their doors were finally opened... and were forced to conclude many unequal treaties with them. However, after Emperor Meiji ascended the throne in 1867, he worked hard to imitate the methods of the European and American powers, reformed and modernized, and industry and commerce developed day by day, and the national power also became stronger day by day..."—Lecture 6, "Ryukyu Becomes a Sacrifice."</p>
<p>In the past, Japan, like our country, was also invaded by "European and American powers," but it was able to reform and strengthen itself, not only no longer being bullied by others, but instead bullying our country, which really makes us a little ashamed!</p>
<p>"The British boast: 'Where the sun shines, the British flag flies.' We Chinese can also say the same: 'Where the sun shines, there are footprints of the Chinese.' But we Chinese cannot boast much. When people from other countries go abroad... carrying the mission of colonizing..., they have the government of their country as a bodyguard... Most of the overseas Chinese are hungry brothers in the country, unable to survive in the country, and have no choice but to cross the ocean to find a bite of bitter food. China naturally often suffers their abuse and expulsion. An overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia once said with tears: 'Our status in foreign countries is worse than that of a dog. A dog can still gnaw on the meat bones thrown by its master!'... In fact, we should say: 'Where the sun shines, there are blood, tears and bones of overseas Chinese.'"—Lecture 17, "Are We Only Good for Rolling Away?"</p>
<p>Our country is disappointing, causing our compatriots overseas to live a "subhuman" life, which naturally makes us heartbroken. In fact, given the current situation, if we do not work hard to save the country and survive, the entire nation will be reduced to a state of slavery.</p>
<p>"Anyone who sees the current situation in China will shake their heads and sigh, but I hope my readers will not do so. Some people think that the national crises of the past hundred years are all because China is not competitive enough and should not have allowed the powers to blast open the door during the Opium War; even if the door was blasted open, they should have awakened as soon as possible and embarked on the path of self-strengthening like Japan... It is true that some parts of China are not competitive enough, and it is also a fact that some Chinese are too mixed up. However, the common people of China are no worse than those of other countries, and we do not need to belittle ourselves too much; no nation in the world is born only fit to be slaves. Look at the contributions of the Chinese in the islands of Southeast Asia. The Chinese are truly the most hardworking, gentlest, and greatest nation... But if they do not rise up again, and the hungry brothers in the country continue to beat each other bloody, without thinking that the reason for not having food is the powers, then China truly has no hope."—Lecture 20, "Partition? Devour? Or Rejuvenation?"</p>
<p>"China is awake! The Chinese who are about to starve to death or become slaves are awake! The various national crises of the past are alarm bells to awaken us. We want to rejuvenate... We want to struggle out of the fate of starvation and slavery. There is only one way, that is to unite the four hundred million people and use our own flesh and blood to defeat the powers. Our hungry brothers, quickly stop killing each other. It is the powers that have been approaching us step by step for the past hundred years that have made us hungry. If we defeat the powers, everyone will have food to eat."—Ibid.</p>
<p>The author's conclusion is naturally correct, but in terms of the current situation, we must pay special attention to our most ferocious enemies among the powers and fully utilize the contradictions between other powers to attack the most ferocious enemies.</p>
<h3 id="e206">China in the Eyes of Foreigners <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Si Xi</p>
<p>It is said that foreigners often regard China as a "mysterious" country, and this is not without reason. China is large in area, has a large population, and has a complex and intricate social organization. It is not easy for foreigners to thoroughly understand, and even we Chinese ourselves do not understand it very clearly, especially in terms of the people's thinking. Fascists often regard them as easily tamed slaves, conspirators often regard them as easily ignited flames, pessimists often say they are dead ashes pulled out of the furnace, and optimists say they will be the red sun after a rainstorm. Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own reasons, but these reasons often do not have any reliable basis. Because their arguments are only based on their own purposes and do not start from actual experience.</p>
<p>But strangely enough, many of China's "mysteries" often need to be revealed by foreigners who think they don't understand them very well, such as the discovery of mineral resources in desolate mountains, the excavation of treasures in ancient tombs, etc.</p>
<p>Not only that, but also from "A Japanese View of China" (written by Japanese Uchiyama Kanzo, translated by Yu Bingqi, published by Kaiming Bookstore, price 35 cents), which I recently read, I saw a foreigner—the author—revealing many more important mysteries of our country—"the mystery of the people's feelings."</p>
<p>To be honest, Japanese research on China has indeed reached a very deep level. Just taking their diagnosis that our country's "big figures" all suffer from "Japanophobia" is enough for us to admire. But it seems to be the first time that "the people's feelings" have been portrayed so deeply as in this book.</p>
<p>The greatest characteristic of this book is that the author, unlike other Japanese, does not study China with selfish malice, but with the purpose of "taking the good and discarding the bad." But only in this way can his observations have unexpectedly profound places. He can see authentic "civilization" from what people think is "barbarism," and see complete "barbarism" from what people think is "civilization." His eyes directly penetrate into the hearts of the Chinese people, and his diagnosis is by no means like other similar books, only speculating from the surface. This is his unique point and the reason why he has created a new example in other Japanese books studying China.</p>
<p>The entire book contains thirty-two essays. Trying to analyze these texts one by one, we cannot help but admire the author's unique observations. The following points can be clearly pointed out:</p>
<p>First, he pointed out the expression of the Chinese people's idea of sympathy for the stage of division.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, the people of our country have been subjected to repeated natural disasters, man-made disasters, foreign insults, internal troubles, and the disturbance of traitors and local bullies, so that the property that ancestors had worked so hard to pass down for thousands of years was about to reach the point of "eating and selling everything." Except for a few capitalists, almost everyone is poor. In Europe and America, the property of an average family can be at least tens of thousands, but in China, how many people can be found among a hundred who have property worth more than ten thousand? Most people are so poor that they "don't know what will happen tomorrow." It is no longer surprising that an entire family commits suicide by poisoning because one person loses their job. Therefore, everyone has unconsciously developed the concept of "harmony and mutual assistance" to maintain each other. Therefore, they regard the misfortune of the poor as their own misfortune in the future, and use helping others as a preparation for others to help themselves in the future. This phenomenon is truly a good result earned by the people of the country through all kinds of hardships. But no one has mentioned it much, and this book is the first to do so.</p>
<p>The article "Buying Retail is Cheaper" says that the clerks in the store unconsciously have a kind of psychology that "people who can't afford to buy more must be poor," and they should "give more" goods, which creates the principle that buying retail is cheaper. "Pricing Based on the Person" says that small clerks do business and set prices based on the wealth of the buyer. "Leftovers" and "Another Leftover" say that it is reasonable for beggars to grab the leftovers from the meal service. "Life and Rights" uses the atrocities of the Shanghai Concession's abolition of shantytowns to refute the kindness of the military and civilians in the Chinese area outside the concession towards the poor. Each article relies on the author's own observations to explain and comment, and they are all very rare records.</p>
<p>Second, he pointed out a misunderstanding that is most likely to occur when foreigners first arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although there is only one article "Same Habits," its value is really great. It says that Japanese people who first arrive in Shanghai, because they don't speak the language and have heard that the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai are all bad guys, are careful to guard against them as soon as they get on the rickshaw. Occasionally, when the rickshaw passes through a dark alley or walks to a deserted place, they immediately think that the rickshaw puller is going to rob them. A preemptive mentality prompts them to start fighting, and as a result, a fierce fight occurs. The poor rickshaw puller not only doesn't get half a drop of blood money, but also suffers injuries, and even loses his life. Doesn't the Shanghai newspaper report a news story half a month ago about a British man beating a rickshaw puller to death? According to the British man's own confession, the reason is still here. The author now dissects the psychology of these passengers in detail and pleads for a great injustice for the innocent rickshaw pullers, which is really worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Third, he appropriately assesses Chinese customs and human feelings.</p>
<p>This may be the author's greatest purpose in writing this book. In "A Kind of Gang," he talks about the close concept of the Chinese people for "gangs," such as "Ningbo Gang" and "Guangdong Gang." "Three Kinds of Nature" says that the Chinese people are unwilling to be serious in doing things. "Convenient Tea" says that the Chinese people are intellectually pure. "Mutual Aid Banquet" says that the Chinese people have wonderful ways to deal with the costs of weddings, funerals, and birthdays. "The Words That a Limited Company Cannot Make a Profit" are very accurate:</p>
<p>"...As soon as a company is established, all the directors will pull their personal family relatives and related people into the company to eat the company's food... Even if Japanese companies have relatives and friends in positions, they have their own need to hold the position. After joining the company, each has its own duties... It is not the same in China... They just smoke cigarettes and take dry wages every day."</p>
<p>The author calls this situation "eating downism," which can be said to be extremely humorous. "Thorough Practical Life" implies that the Chinese love to calculate everything. ""A Certain Day's Transaction Talk" talks about the airs of the Chinese officialdom. "Is the Chinese Individualistic?" says that the Chinese have patience. "The Concept of Gambling" says that the mentality of Chinese and Japanese gamblers is different. "Words about Foreign Yarn," "Words about Ceiling," and "Failure If You Don't Devote All Your Strength" are all the author's insights from studying the psychology of Chinese merchants and customers. "Stealing and Falling" says "greasing palms." Others, such as "Fortune, Prosperity and Longevity," "Kidnapping," "Heaven Never Cuts Off All Hope," "Saying Thank You Loses Its Intimacy," "Labor-Management Coordination," "Needle Point and Fist," etc., all have interesting observations and appropriate diagnoses of our Chinese customs and human feelings. Due to space limitations, I can only ask readers to taste them for themselves.</p>
<p>As Mr. Lu Xun said in the preface, this book also has a shortcoming: "There is a tendency to say more about the advantages of China," but in some places, we can look at it from the opposite side and discover our own shortcomings.</p>
<p>As for his observations, of course, they cannot be very insightful everywhere. In some places, he has not yet touched the most profound realm. Such as in "Mutual Aid Banquet," he said:</p>
<p>"It is too far from the truth to say that Chinese people go bankrupt for half their lives because of weddings, and go bankrupt for the rest of their lives because of funerals..."</p>
<p>His reason is that the income from the gifts at each banquet can offset the expenses and have a surplus. Except for a few property owners, "most" are like this. In fact, it's not right. The more property owners there are, the more income they receive from gifts. The poorer people are, the more they have to lose their capital. Everyone knows this, because wealthy people naturally have more relatives and friends than people with no property, not to mention those who flatter and praise them. Before the "New Life" movement, didn't some "important people" deliberately create some celebrations to make money?</p>
<p>But in any case, this book is always a pioneering work that is worth reading for the Chinese people. It is the first book to delve into our Chinese people. We study Japan, only knowing to study its history and writing, but neglecting its people, just like they studied our country before this book. Now that we have read this book, we should also work harder ourselves!</p>
<h3 id="e207">Common Sense Everyone Should Possess <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Proverbs Four</p>
<p>Recently, a friend wrote to tell me that two lives were lost in his hometown. In one case, a daughter-in-law was slapped twice by her mother-in-law at the doorway. In response, the daughter-in-law secretly ate two boxes of red-head matches. When the poison took effect, it was the middle of the night. They wanted to send her to the hospital, but the hospital was in the city, more than ten miles away, and it was a dark night. Everyone was helpless, and as a result, a life was lost. In another case, a person fell into the river after getting drunk. People immediately rescued him, but he had swallowed a lot of water, and his breathing had stopped. The villagers didn't know anything about artificial respiration. As a result, they left him to his fate, and another life was lost.</p>
<p>My friend felt that everyone should have some common sense of first aid because of these two deaths. Therefore, he wrote to me, asking me to buy him two books so that he could read and study them himself, so that he could find ways to apply them when he encountered similar things in the countryside again. He said that saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. In any case, he had to buy him a few books. I don't understand medical knowledge. It was really "asking a blind man for directions" for him to ask me to buy such first aid books. Fortunately, a colleague came to my residence, and I showed him the letter. He recommended two books published by Kaiming Bookstore: "Popular Medical First Aid" by Shou Bai and "Common Sense of First Aid for Illnesses and Injuries" co-edited by Huang Zifang and others. I was very happy at the time and immediately bought the two books back.</p>
<p>Now that the books were bought, naturally, I should enjoy the priority of reading them. After reading them, I felt that this kind of common medical knowledge is something that everyone should have. In the past, I had a wrong idea, thinking that first aid medical knowledge should only be possessed by people who live in the countryside and are far away from hospitals. People like me who live in the city, where there are many hospitals, don't seem to need it. Now I know that's not right, because it doesn't hurt to have any knowledge. Besides, first aid is very "urgent." Even if there is a hospital nearby, sending the patient there quickly will still be a bit slow. Furthermore, lacking this knowledge, one will be in a panic and may even make mistakes. It's better to have this common sense oneself, so that one can save oneself if possible, and if one can't save oneself, one can make proper arrangements to avoid accidents, and one won't be in a panic. I think there must be many people who have had my past wrong idea, so I wrote this passage.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about the content of these two books: the content of these two books is the same, but "Common Sense of First Aid for Illnesses and Injuries" is simpler and smaller, a small book that can be put in a pocket and carried around. The author of "Popular Medical First Aid" is a very famous doctor in Shanghai. The writing is very popular, and the description is very concise. It is divided into four chapters: The first chapter is on first aid treatment, from the essentials of first aid to the first aid methods for various diseases and injuries, divided into sixteen sections. The second chapter is on infectious diseases and disinfection methods, divided into three sections, explaining the types of infectious diseases, the portals of entry into the human body, the conditions of onset, prevention methods, etc., as well as various disinfection methods. The third chapter is on medicines that should be kept at home, divided into five sections, describing the dosage of medicines, preparation methods, children's dosage, and main medicines. The fourth chapter is on medical equipment that should be kept at home, divided into eleven sections, detailing all the simple and indispensable medical equipment for families.</p>
<p>Now it is winter, and when the weather gets cold, many people will light fires for warmth. However, one may die from carbon monoxide poisoning if one is not careful. The great geologist Mr. Ding Zaijun died of carbon monoxide poisoning. It is said that Dr. Ma Yinchu, an economist, suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning last year. Because he was aware of it, he took immediate measures to save himself and was spared an invitation from the King of Hell. Four years ago, I suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning twice in Dezhou and Peiping, vomiting a lot of blood. Fortunately, I was rescued quickly and spared my life. For ourselves and to save others, I think this kind of first aid knowledge is something that everyone should have!</p>
<h3 id="e208">My Newly Made Friends <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhe Feng</p>
<p>—After reading "Wen Xin"—</p>
<p>Although my junior high school life has long become a spring dream of yesterday and is increasingly distant from me, recently it has allowed me to get to know several junior high school friends. Although I have never met them, their faces and personalities are exceptionally familiar.</p>
<p>Zhou Lehua is a very healthy young man.</p>
<p>Zhang Dawen is a fatherless child.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhiqing speaks very clearly.</p>
<p>Hu Fuchu is a chubby fellow.</p>
<p>Du Zhenyu doesn't talk much on weekdays.</p>
<p>They are all young people full of emotion, with a strong desire for knowledge and keen sensitivity. Since I became acquainted with them, I have been inseparable from them all day long. Sometimes we review Chinese language lectures together, sometimes we edit wall newspapers together, sometimes we visit the article hospital with a dollar, sometimes we rehearse dramas, sometimes we visit famous mountains, sometimes we hold lectures, sometimes we hold symposiums… All day long, it's either research or discussion. Our spirits seem to be fused together like milk and water.</p>
<p>In fact, I have also gained a lot of benefits from them: they treat me with innocent friendship and sincere hearts, which makes me deeply feel the joy of life and human sympathy. They also show me how to read books that are not written with words.</p>
<p>Yes, they have given me a lot, arousing my interest in research, and giving me more knowledge and methods than I gained in the past three years of junior high school. Therefore, I have indeed built a very high level of friendship with them. I have shed tears of sympathy for Lehua's dropping out of school and worried about the friendship between Dawen and Jinhua. I have also been convinced by their high-sounding arguments, and I have also been… In short, they are all friends that I will always remember in my heart.</p>
<p>The reason why I am able to get acquainted with these friends is thanks to our introducers, Mr. Xia Mianzun and Mr. Ye Shengtao. They not only enabled me to meet them, but also enabled them to recognize me and to recognize all of China—or it can be said, the whole world—thousands upon thousands of young people.</p>
<p>As Mr. Zhu Ziqing said in this book, "Mianzun and Shengtao writing the story of reading and writing in 'Wen Xin' is indeed a meritorious deed."</p>
<p>Therefore, we—I and the thousands upon thousands of young people who have read Wen Xin—should also agree with what Mr. Chen Wangdao said in this book: "We should thank Mr. Mianzun and Mr. Shengtao for thinking about young people, painstakingly collecting the most advanced knowledge of the present, and writing it in an easy-to-understand way, so that we young people also have the opportunity to approach it."</p>

<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Our country's unification had just succeeded, and the resistance against foreign aggression had just achieved victory, when suddenly an incident occurred in Xi'an. People at home and abroad were all aghast and astonished.</p>
<p>What is the situation in Xi'an now? What is Zhang Xueliang's purpose? And what is the attitude of the generals? The telegrams that have been sent are full of conflicting claims, and here in Xi'an, where news is blocked, we have no way to guess.</p>
<p>However, based on Zhang Xueliang's own character, he should not, and must not, betray the central government and commit the absurd act of kidnapping Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Let me ask, who was it that lost the three northeastern provinces amidst the red lights and green wine? Who was it that promoted and cultivated him after he returned to the country, and brought him to his current position? Now, at a time when the resistance against the enemy is tense, he suddenly takes this extraordinary action. I ask, where is his conscience?</p>
<p>Moreover, now is a time when bandits and puppets are active, and the work of resisting the enemy is progressing smoothly, and there is hope of recovering lost territory. Zhang should make amends for his past mistakes and serve on the frontier, which is exactly the right time. Now he is kidnapping his leader and defending himself with troops. This kind of action is not only a betrayal of the party and the country, but is tantamount to helping the bandits and puppets to counterattack. The lack of conscience in a person has reached this point.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Tsim Sha Tsui <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>Although the season has reached late autumn, the island in the south still floats with waves of heat. There are bare-chested coolies on the pier, and men and women swimming on the beach, everything is no different from summer. This reminds me of the late autumn I spent in the north, which was constantly invaded by storms and cold—at this moment I should thank the great nature of this island, it has given me, this wanderer, infinite grace. Warm sunshine—may it forever accompany me in my life, so that the cruel winter has no chance to attack me.</p>
<p>It has been almost two months since I came to Hong Kong—Birmingham is suffering from malaria because he is not accustomed to the climate—we are both impoverished and cannot afford a doctor, so we can only let the disease grow—however, he has gradually improved in the past week, so I took him out to travel and play in the mountains and rivers, so that he can recover his health sooner.</p>
<p>Yesterday we visited "Mount Davis," and today we plan to spend the whole day visiting Kowloon. Birmingham said that he hadn't bathed in the sea for many days, so when he got to Kowloon he had to go to "Lai Chi Kok" to swim and visit "Tsim Sha Tsui."</p>
<p>Early in the morning, we went to the pier to take the ferry. It only costs three cents per person to get to Kowloon on the other side.</p>
<p>Fishing boats returning from outside the port gathered in the port like schools of fish. The faint morning light shone on the sails, and the sea was calm. After a quarter of an hour, we moved to Kowloon City.</p>
<p>At the end of the street market, we discovered "Tsim Sha Tsui," this long strip of countryside. "Tsim Sha Tsui" is bordered by the sea on one side, and stretches to Hung Hom on the other side. Its back is close to foreign houses and roads. It is not right to say that it is desolate here, but it cannot be regarded as a lively place either. It is best to take a walk here.</p>
<p>The boundless green grass is bathed in the intoxicating sunlight. Its color is more beautiful and lovely than the sea water, but it does not have the delicate tenderness of spring or the lush greenness of summer—at this time, cold dew seems to be attached to its body. Obviously, this is not the immortal dew that nourishes it, but the disaster water that destroys its life. The branches of the green trees are shaking lively, and the sea is also laughing with ripples. The air is fresh, and we feel so happy! If there wasn't dew on the grass, we would definitely roll around on it.</p>
<p>We walked hand in hand towards the sea. Surprisingly—that old fisherman I knew in Shek Sarp, Hong Kong, appeared here again. I happily went up to greet him…</p>
<p>——Uncle! Why did you come here so early this morning?</p>
<p>——We don't have a fixed place! We go wherever there are fish. Are you two here to play so early?</p>
<p>He was tidying up the fishing nets. The boat was swaying, and the fish basket was half empty. Judging from his expression, the fish probably weren't getting caught in the nets.</p>
<p>This old man is a small and thin man. The cheekbones on his face are unusually high, causing his cheeks to sink. His forehead is covered with several deep wrinkles of wind and dust. Although his life is very poor, his attitude seems very leisurely, and he rarely shows a sad face. He is always kind and amiable as he does his work. The sea is the source of his life, his desires, his ideals, all are entrusted to the sea, this boundless sea!</p>
<p>I first met him in Shek Sarp, where I went to bathe every day, so I had many opportunities to contact him. On this island in the south, besides my companion Birmingham, he—the lovely old fisherman—has become one of the people I like to approach the most. He tells me about his life experiences and his history of struggling with life, as well as many bizarre and strange stories, and even tells me his unspeakable secrets frankly, which moves me to the point of tears. He and we are both insulted and harmed, but the pain and oppression he has suffered is a deeper layer than ours, and he understands better than us how difficult life is!</p>
<p>The old man was busy fishing, so we didn't bother him and walked away. We couldn't bear to leave this grassland and wanted to play to our heart's content before leaving. After a while, a neat sound of footsteps came. Looking over, it was the "Indian soldiers" who came here to practice.</p>
<p>Those who practiced were all "Indian soldiers." They were as strong and energetic as oxen, as if they were going to the battlefield to kill the enemy. Heavy footsteps followed the orders of the officers and ran back and forth. Sometimes they practiced field warfare, sometimes they practiced cavalry changes, and sometimes they practiced live ammunition shooting! The commander—that imposing white man!—shouted various commands, dividing them into two teams, each occupying one side, and then attacking each other according to the commander's orders. The "Indian soldiers" showed no expression on their faces, simply like a machine in motion. The rifles on their shoulders were fitted with bright</p>

<p>dazzling bayonets] The light threatened the sun, threatened the countryside, and threatened this colony.</p>
<p>My heart was oppressed by a weight, and my breathing was almost suffocated. We were silent, silent, watching their exercise, and only after they were over did we regain our normal breathing, as if we had been released from shackles. Ah! Those Indian soldiers, they are driven from colony to colony, from their own land to other places to help their enemies oppress the slaves of the colony. The bloodstains on their bodies have not yet healed, but they follow the oppressors to slaughter weak nations!</p>
<p>The roar of the train broke through the clear and quiet sky. The flag of the English warship fluttered. The "Indian soldiers" left in neat steps, and we also began to go to "Lai Chi Kok."</p>

<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>In the morning, the sky was only a little bit hazy, and I was awakened by the coughing and choking of the old man next to me. I opened my eyes and looked outside the door. Snowflakes were floating in the sky, and the howling wind shook several of the pillars in the house a little. At the top of a row of clamshell window sills, there were several sparrows chirping: as if they, like us, had come here to take refuge.</p>
<p>My wife was probably exhausted from being disturbed by the children last night, and was still sleeping soundly close to my body. The child was lying under her elbow, his little face was thin and yellow, looking unlike himself.</p>
<p>The weather last night was really cold. Lying on the straw was like lying on ice. A wave of cold air drilled into my bones, making it impossible for me to close my eyes. I just listened to the heavy sighs and low cries of sorrow. The child was clamoring for hunger and cold. My wife was reminiscing about her old home, not forgetting those thirty-odd pregnant ewes… She hoped that the war would calm down immediately, so that she could return to her warm home. But when she thought that her old home had been swallowed by artillery fire, she felt an indescribable pain in her heart!</p>
<p>The sky gradually brightened, and the white light slipped into the house, making everything in the hall very clear. I saw that on the dusty shrine, a spider was weaving a web in the corner, and a sense of being homeless arose from the depths of my heart—the refugees who were lying haphazardly on the straw on the ground were sitting up one by one. A stuffy and foul odor was brewing in the room, but the heavy sighs and low cries of sorrow filled the entire room again. They had not forgotten the hunger in their bellies, nor had they forgotten the homes that had been swallowed by cannons and bombs. But everyone was still worried that the cannons and bombs would one day spread to this place.</p>
<p>The child woke up. As soon as he opened his eyes, he clamored for something to eat, but there was nothing at this time. What could I take to give him to eat? My wife also sat up painfully, patted him, and tried all kinds of ways to coax him, but it was useless. I looked at my wife's expression and felt that something was wrong. I reached out and tried her forehead, and it was as hot as a stove. I quickly retracted my hand and said softly…</p>
<p>"You're sick!"</p>
<p>But she just shook her head, looked at me with melancholy eyes for a while, and reluctantly answered me… "No…" Her voice was so low.</p>
<p>Snowflakes flew down from the sky like smoke. They had not stopped from morning to noon, and were getting tighter and tighter. However, no one had been seen bringing anything to fill our hunger. Everyone was holding an empty stomach, staring blankly at the gray and dilapidated walls in a daze.</p>
<p>Another group of refugees threw themselves into the shelter. They were all as embarrassed as us, old, young, male, and female. Some were crying, and some were sighing.</p>
<p>In a not very large earth god temple, three or four hundred men and women were squeezed in, and there was no room to put a foot. Now that more and more people are crowding in, wouldn't it be necessary to break this earth god temple? But, but we are all people who have fallen into trouble, all want to escape for our lives, what discrimination is there! Food was distributed, and each person received two cold and hard dry steamed buns. Some people grabbed them and gnawed on them, and drank snow to quench their thirst. Those toothless old people could only swallow saliva while looking at these steamed buns. Although their stomachs were rumbling and clear water was constantly rising, they couldn't bite them, so what could they do!</p>
<p>I finished gnawing my two dry steamed buns, but my wife still hadn't eaten, but the child was holding a steamed bun and biting it mouthful by mouthful, looking like he was having a hard time eating it.</p>
<p>My wife was moaning softly. I was very worried, worried that she would get sick and not be able to get up. If… what would happen to the child? I really dare not think about it.</p>
<p>"Are you uncomfortable?" I lowered my head and kissed her forehead, which was still very hot, and couldn't help asking.</p>
<p>"I'm very thirsty!" She nodded spasmodically to me. But there was no place to find water here, only snow could be taken to quench her thirst. In desperation, I watched my wife's distress and finally took a handful of snow, watching my wife swallow it happily, as if she was swallowing it with relish.</p>
<p>More groups of refugees kept coming in, and we were squeezed even tighter.</p>
<p>Night gradually fell, and the room suddenly became dark and gloomy. Although the snow outside had stopped, the wind was louder than during the day. There were no lights in the room. In the darkness, sighs, cries, curses, and resentments were constantly swaying in every corner.</p>
<p>Dinner, as usual, was two cold and hard dry steamed buns per person.</p>
<p>But, where is my home, where is my hometown? From now on, where will we go to live?</p>
