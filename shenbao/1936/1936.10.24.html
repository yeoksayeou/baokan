<p>（東京）中日談判於最近兩日、復呈緊張空氣、日政府之最後態度、旣須待須磨總領返東京後、始能决定、則引起各方爭辯之盛傳種種消息、自難置信、日本現顯握有是否能打破目前難關之關鍵、換言之、日本現正處於抑遵照其嚴重之决心、聽令其全部决裂、或維持其旣定之政策、循外交途徑覓求妥協之二途中、扶擇其一、一般觀察咸認爲日本最智慧之方法、厥爲免去不必要之决裂、據日日新聞之可靠消息、日政府之立塲、大槪如下、華北及防共問題、雖爲日本原定計畫之一部份、但亦可以其他方法解决之、故仍有對全般計畫重加檢討之餘地、但關於上述諸問題、日本不願受任何協定之束縛、日本决意拒絕中國所提之任何對案、關於日本對華北及防共兩問題所提之要求、日本之目的、僅在向國民政府獲得一般保證、蓋苟能如此、則現政府於實行其國策時、始不致發牛阻碍也云、又據該報南京特別電訊、總領携有重要建議二點、返東京呈請當局加以考慮、並向當局請訓、第一點、中日兩國對華北及防共兩問題、旣無完全瞭解之希望、結果必使兩國意見發生深刻之裂痕、故現應對所採各項計劃之方針、重加考慮、並對日本之計劃、規定明確具體之限制、第二點免除談判决裂一層、旣認爲必要、但同時一味延宕、亦非所宜、故須於最近之將來、對目前談判、成立暫時的結論、一切重要事件、留待將來談判、該報南京特訊又稱、日本在華官員之意見、一致認爲目前談判不應停頓云、按上述消息、此間一般均認爲極屬可靠、（廿三日中央社電）</p>

<p>日各報論調　態度顯不一致　大部份主循外交途徑　促兩國談判底於成功</p>
<p>（東京）日本各報對於駐南京總領事須磨氏此决來東京之理由、顯然難以推測、大部份報紙之意見、皆以爲日本駐華之外交官、已主張修改日本之要求、允以關於華北及防共兩問題爲最甚、蓋不如此、則中日間之談判、或已早吿破裂也、各報又稱、日外務省職責所在、自應表現一種妥洽之精神、俾得循外交途徑、促使兩國之談判、底於成功、另有一部份報紙、則稱須磨返任之時、將携有日方致川越大使之新訓令、命其維持一種不妥洽之態度云云、朝日新聞則謂日外務省當局、對於中國之「拖延」手段、頗爲忿怒、並决心予以克服云、每日新聞載稱、川越大使曾通知外務省、謂日方如堅持中國必須接受其全部要求、恐談判將有破裂之一日、是以有田外相、始决定表示妥洽之精神、以爲解决中日間各懸案之唯一途徑、惟海陸軍當局、對於條改日本所提要求事、將有反對之表示云、日日新聞之論調、謂日本政府對於放棄以外交方法解决懸案及修正日本之要求兩事、必須擇一而行、據稱有田外相昨曾訪晤廣田首相、請其對於妥洽政策、表示贊同、該報又稱、日海陸軍兩方面對於此項政策、恐未必肯加贊助云、朝日新聞謂日政府向中政府提出之要求、乃整個而不能分開者、苟非中國完全接受要求各項中流露之精神、則日本絕對不能有何讓步、日本之態度未有變更、仍將堅决拒絕接受足以限制日本將來在華行動之條件云、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>西班牙亂事的展望</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>富有國際背景的西班牙人民陣綫和法西斯陣綫兩大勢力的决戰。自爆發以來。已有三個月了。現在法西斯派領袖佛蘭哥將軍所領導的反政府軍。因獲有歐洲法西斯國家的援助。實力雄厚。已直迫西京瑪德里。人民陣綫的政府軍則在首都積極建築防禦工程。準備死守。而京中人民更隨時遊行示威。女子勗男子全數出發前錢。和反政府軍一决最後的勝利。慘酷的瑪德里爭奪戰已迫在目前了。</p>
<p>跟着西班牙反政府軍在軍事上的迅速進展。被發現的國際陰謀也越多。西班牙全國總工會巳發見反政府軍在開始反叛的時候。巳和德意締結密約。允於事成之後。割讓米諾爾加島和摩洛哥的北部等地給德意。並分一些餘瀝給葡萄牙。以為援助的報酬。　德意葡三國在不干涉西亂恊定成立以後。仍不絕地給反政府軍以人力和物力的援助。而最近德意的柏林談話。對於承認反政府軍的政府問題。很可能獲得具體的决定。法國人民陣綫政府。對於西班牙政府軍是很同情的。萊翁勃倫費了九牛二虎之力。促成不干涉西亂恊定。以阻止意德等國對反政府軍的援助。英國本來很願意支持反政府軍的勢力。以維持其經濟利益。但自聽到反政府軍和德意等國締結密的的消息以後。很是驚惶。因密的所規定的事伴一旦實現。則它在地中海的覇權會因此勁搖的。所以她就附和了法國的主張。促成不干涉恊定。以威脅反政府軍。現在據哈瓦斯社的推測。反政府軍經此威脅。似已對英國提出了滿意的保證。故英國不願再有進一步的表示了。</p>
<p>德意和葡萄牙旣破壞不干涉協定。而英國又躱在不干涉協定的盾牌背後。袖手旁觀。這無怪同情西班牙人民陣綫的蘇聯要提出抗議。指不干涉協定為侵略國援助反政府軍的烟幕。而向調整委員會要求切實制止德意與葡萄牙等國援助反政府軍。否則就要考慮退出恊定。恢復自由行動了。蘇聯的抗議到今為止。似乎還沒有發生顯著的效果。二十二日法外長台爾博斯在衆院外交委員會席上說。西班牙局勢發展結果。蘇聯倘竟牽入戰爭漩渦。則法國對於蘇聯並未負有任何互助的義務。因為按照法蘇互助公約的規定。必須締約國的一方的領土遭人攻擊時。他方才有互助的義務。至於目前法國政府對於西班牙問題所採取的立塲。不擬有所變更。」就此看來。雖是與蘇聯有共同利害關係的法國。對於蘇聯的抗議也顯得十分冷淡了。</p>
<p>調整委員會昨日召集會議。協商不干涉西亂的確實保證。依過去的經騐來推測。這次會議仍不會有甚麽具體的結果。目前蘇聯已到非制北德意等國援助反政府軍。就要退出恊定。採取自由行動的重大關頭。而德意等國則勢必仍採陽奉陰違的辦法。來敷衍英法這種局勢的展開。是很容易引起國際間左右兩大勢力的直接衝突的。</p>
<h3>左右兩集團對峙　歐洲危機潛伏　各國運用外交策略　親德親俄旗幟分明</h3>

<p>我國航空設備的簡陋，國防的本虛，是無可諱言的。現在大禍已將臨頭，一旦爆發，我們四萬萬民族的生命，不都成了猙獰的帝國主義者飛機巨彈下的犧牲品嗎？我們五千年歷史的古國，不頓成了强暴的侵略主義者殘酷轟炸下的瓦礫塲嗎？九一八的淚痕未乾，一二八的慘狀猶在我們不甘亡國亡家，那就非以全國民衆的力量，來充實航空設備不可！</p>
<p>我國四萬萬九千萬民族，過去旣已飽嘗着侵略中義者殘酷轟炸的痛苦，深知簡陋的航空設備，不足以生存現世界，於是在前年便有中國航空協會之創立，同時並舉辦航空救國募欵購機，以爲國防之助。本會同人，本愛國的熱忱，也組織航空救國募欵委員會，以盡國民的職責。結果成績極佳，滬人士當能想及寗波號飛機與各界同時舉行命名典禮時的盛况。</p>
<p>蔣委員長盡瘁黨國，勞苦功高，是我們的唯一領袖。今年五十大慶，我們在擁戴熱忱之下，組織了寗波旅滬同鄉購機祝壽慕欵委員會·推定虞洽卿朱守梅金廷蓀爲正副委員長，值筱庵徐至禪張繼光兪佐庭吳道汀袁履登竺梅先爲常務委員，張申之鳥崖琴毛和源爲總幹事。成立之後，假亨利路八十二號聚餐討論辦法：到的除各委員外，有劉鴻生張詠霓孫鶴臯王伯元周祥生秦潤卿孫衡甫……五十餘人。當時都以爲委員長之壽，就是我們中華民國的壽：而購飛機以固國防，實在是我國祈年永命的唯一要着，一致主張募欵十萬元，獨立購機呈獻政府，以爲委員長壽。幾個月來，我們得同鄕諸君的熱烈贊助，大功已慶告成。我們要以壽蔣季員長者壽中國，要以壽委員長一人者壽四萬萬五千萬的民族？我們更熱望世界弱小民族，一致以武裝答復侵略者的武裝，以國防的空軍答復侵略者的空軍；使侵略者知所歙迹，而弱小民族纔得永存於世界。</p>

<h3>旅業公會募集航空捐之經過</h3>
<p>— 孫秋屛</p>
<p>（一）發起動機：自滬戰發生，國人對於空軍之威力及慘酷，已有深切認識，旅業同人，痛定思痛，以爲救國圖存，必須建設空軍，而建設空軍，尤須人民協助政府，共同努力，當時甡泰旅館姚頌年，衛生旅館周松溪，兩委員，首先建議，旅業應募欵購機，其建議書大意略謂：現在侵略國家之民衆，莫不熱烈協助政府，募欵購機，而被侵略國之民衆，豈能漠視淪亡，吾儕應急起直追，以盡匹夫之責，以全市旅館之營業，如能提成抽收，必能集腋成裘，購置戰機，假使全國各業均聞風興起，則因旅業之購機，以倡導全國各業之響應，其有俾於救亡圖存之力量，豈淺尠哉！用特提請召集大會，公决云云，是卽爲旅業慕欵購機之最初動機，</p>
<p>（二）决定辦法：旅業同人旣具慕欺購機之動機，乃苦心劈劃，募欵之辦法，念二年五月十八日，本市航空協會致函本會，　贊助航空運動，盡力捐輸，當卽召集第十二决執監全體會議，並山航空協會派張裕良代表出席，經議决（甲）請張代表轉達總隊長，以實力補助公會組織健全，以便徵募，（乙）推派姚頌年，周松溪，孫秋屛，高渭夫，徐文照，徐孟園，嚴蓉卿，張翼臣諸委員，而謁吳總隊長，協商進行，（丙）通過上海市旅館業抽收航　救國捐辦法如下：（一）上海市旅業公會爲恊動　　航空恊會廣　航空救　　金起見，訂定本辦法：（二）各旅館照房金加抽航空救國捐百分之五，（三）各旅館抽收航空救國捐每月結束一次，繳交中國航空協會，（四）各旅館抽收航空救國捐，須填給收據交與旅客，（五）各旅館須將抽收航空救國捐辦法，懸貼於各房間內，以便旅客週知，（六）旅館業抽收航空救國捐，以募足二十萬元爲限，（七）中國航空協會，印就抽收旅館業航空捐　聯單收據，分發各旅館，（八）中國航空協會得派員稽查抽捐情形，倘有流弊，應依法罰辦，（九）中國航空協會，應每月公布旅館業航空救國捐收入數，（十）本辦法呈請市政府核准施行，</p>
<p>（三）勸募經過（甲）開始征收，自征收辦法，並經市政府核准後，中間經過縝密之準備工作，並調查全市旅館之悄况，分爲特，甲，乙，丙，丁，五等級，準備就緒，乃於念三年四月—五日通古開始征收，請航空協會加派人員，担任稽查，惟開征伊始，窒碍甚多，起首有捕房之誤會，幾使工作，陷於停頓，（乙）交涉情形，旅館開征航空捐之後，兩租界常局，未明征收之意旨，引起誤會，制止征收，於是多數旅館，均宜告停止，紛請交涉，本會卽請航空協會，轉呈市政府提出抗議，旋經市府交涉結果，誤會盡釋，乃於六月二十五日由航空協會假座八仙橋青年會，召集各大旅此代表，磋商續正辦法，由英總隊長”由商會　　　　輪，相繼指　，並卽商决績征辦法如左：</p>
<p>一·定期七月十日一律繼續征收，</p>
<p>二·呈請市政府重發佈告勸導，</p>
<p>三·無論特甲乙丙丁各旅館一律征收，如有某一旅社不願征收，自動酌量繳納若干，以示贊助，</p>
<p>四·特甲乙丙各等航空捐仍照原辦法扣五厘，丁等三元，亦照原定辦法，</p>
<p>五·請中國航空協會，派員逐H查，對於不征收之旅館，亦請分別加以勸導，（丙）組勸募會，自决定繼續征收，因少數同業之觀望，仍不免影響，本會乃於同年之九月間，組織勸募委員會，推舉旅館碩望，專任勸募工作，勸募委員名單如下：倪顯庭，陳聞達，高渭夫，劉其潤，徐孟園，周松溪，姚頌年，嚴蓉卿，詹文禧，李文瑞，沈長庚，徐信全，張仁良，李介眉，顧介眉，徐文照，趙荃生，鄒燮卿，張啟元，姚肇基，王長庚，孫秋屛，周翔聲，任岳二，陳天隱等二十五人，當時經各勸募委員，分任勸慕工作，各旅館感於公誼私交，莫不接受勸告，至此乃奠定旅業航空捐之基礎，而正式開始征收矣，（丁）捕房再度干涉，本年三月間，法租界捕房政治部，對於旅業征收航空捐，竟處罰大滬，亞洲，大方，廣泰來，平安，長江，泰安商棧等旅社罰金，並制止征收，同時公共租界各大旅社，亦被捕房派員收繳捐冊收據，復經本會轉請航空協會市政府交涉後，本市各界，均爲本會聲後，結果捕房方面，亦知我人之愛國運動，不宜過遏，因表示對於自動捐輸者，不再阻撓，本會乃勸告同業繼續征收，（四）結論：由上列事實經過，本會征收旅業航空捐，其所遭遇之困難，首爲同業未能一致入會，致準備與實施，均覺倍費時間與精力，次爲租界當局之誤會，引起同業之徘徊觀望，再决爲營業之衰落，同業間互相减價傾軋，幾使同業本身之生存無法維持，其因此影響於航空捐之征收，自不待言，本會除致力於勸慕工作外，更籌劃統一折扣，穩定房價，以爲間接之助力，今幸蒙航空協會吳鐵城總隊長，顧大超總幹事之領導，與各界社會人士之熱誠贊助，得克服困難，完成初步成績，使旅業第一號飛機，能翱翔於天空，但吾人决不以旅業號爲滿足，而允冀旅業隊之成功，於此更聯想旅業號之命名，實可作爲其他各業之試金石，卽旅業能克服困難，購置戰機，其他各業，莫不可以克服困難，聞風興起，必能後來居上，一業如此，推而至於全國各業，都如此，則於救亡圖存之功，又豈可限量乎，</p>

<p>婦女專刊</p>
<h3>怎樣做一個非常時期的婦女</h3>
<p>— 吳子楨</p>
<p>民族的生命已臨到生死關頭，我們女界同胞，該怎樣地覺醒起來，以完成自救救國的責任？我的意見認爲必須顧到下列數端：</p>
<p>一，革心我們知道，有許多女同胞是很有血氣，很能自立的，但也不能否認有許多正做着，或期望着做男子的附庸或玩具！（如姨太太和純以金錢地位爲結合條件的配偶）我們要做一個理智的非常時期的婦女，首先便該革除這種卑劣心理；立刻打起自立自主的旗幟來。</p>
<p>二，節的我們知道到戰事眞正爆發的時候，政府所需要的，除了槍砲等武器外，尚需大量的經濟和糧食！而做男子的附屬品的，又大都是因爲自身消耗太重的緣故，所以我們要自立，要愛護國家，便該從自身節的起</p>
<p>三，轉移你的愛的目標一般年靑有爲的婦女，往住沉迷於羅曼斯的美夢裏，其中雖不乏許多極可貴極高尚的故事；同時我們也不能否認戀愛是靑年生活中的一部，但如果以國家利害爲前提，去作理智的批判，那就覺得他們的沉迷，實在是國家的一重損失！（因爲國家所倚畀的只有我們靑年人，足以負起奮鬥責任的也只有我們靑年人！）所以我雖承認戀愛的高尚性，但我不能承認戀愛至上主義！我不主張陶醉在愛人懷裏，做着可歌可泣的排色夢，我認爲在非常時期的婦女，只應鼓勵愛人或丈夫去爲國效忠，或陪同愛人和丈夫去爲國效忠！因過分繾綣致使男性麻醉，國家喪失勇士的婦女，實在是很可恥的的是與漢奸同罪的！我希望有着愛入（或心愛的丈夫的）的女同胞，要能把愛少數人的愛去愛多數同胞要把你的愛的目標轉移開去，轉移到全國全民族！</p>
<p>四，努力讀書和運動讀書足以增長知識，運動足以强健身體，在大戰爆發後，我們每個國民都應該貢獻自己所有，舉凡自己的生命，自己的財產，都應毫不吝惜地犧牲，但如果學力不足或體力不充，必至欲犧性而不可得，或犧牲得不當！—不過有一點也是大家要認淸的：—犧牲不單指直接的犧性在戰塲上或戰爭中，在後方救護或代替男子的工作，也是犧性的一種！</p>
<p>全國的婦女們！全國站在時代尖端的女同胞！你們應該趕快覺醒起來！準備着負起自己的責任，並須本着立已立人，達己達人的精神，去誘掖後進，使她們一齊爲國效勞，爲國犧牲！</p>
<h3>民族女英雄</h3>
<p>— 文非子</p>
<p>秦良玉是四川忠州人，她不喜歡敷脂粉，她從小就歡喜騎馬，善於射箭，常常女扮男裝，她的丈夫呌馬干乘，是在四川石硅地方做宣撫使，有一次播州（現貴州遵義）兵亂，形勢嚴重，她領了精兵五百，帮助她丈夫去平亂，這是小試其技，百姓己受惠不淺，所以干乘死後，他的官職，便由她代領了。</p>
<p>那時明朝的强敵滿淸，從滿州進攻遼束，邊防十分吃緊，政府命秦良玉帶了軍隊去禦敵，她的哥哥帶兵先出發，不幸到了渾河，（今遼寗境河名）便戰死在那裏，她的弟弟又被敵軍圍困，危急萬狀，秦良玉到了，便把敵軍打退，解去重圍，沒有勇敢本領的人，那能辦得到呢？</p>
<p>良玉回到四川時，正值重慶又被叛軍緊緊地包圍着，她再奮其神武，把敵軍打散，事後重慶的官府，設席爲良玉賀功，這是何等榮耀的一件事！</p>
<p>可是有本領的人，容易遭人妬忌，常時有個總兵李維新，看見良玉屢立大功，十分妬忌，有一决他兵敗回營，良玉去見他，他反關門拒絕，於是良玉上書給皇帝說：「李維新以六尺鬚眉男子，妬忌一個婦人，淸夜自思，應當愧死」，這眞駡得痛快，皇帝於是下詔，命四川一切文武官員，對於良玉應一律注意禮貌，不得疑忌，我們的女英雄是勝利了。</p>
<p>崇禎三年，邊防又告警，良玉奉詔動王，皇帝見她忠心爲國，不怕勞苦，特在平台召見，賜給她四首詩，裏面有兩句：「世間不少奇男子，誰肯沙塲萬里行」，言語中問，實流露着無窮的感慨，而良玉的忠勇亦可以推想而知了。</p>
<p>後來流寇張獻忠，進攻四川，四川當局不能採用良玉的策略，以致賊勢猖獗，沒法抵禦，四川竟被他蹂躪得入烟寥落，十室九空，可是石硅地方，始終沒有被流寇打破，也是良玉和民衆合力抵抗的結果，全省糜爛，一方乾凈，女英雄秦良玉的名字，遂昭昭在人耳目，成爲千古受人崇拜的女英雄了。</p>

<h3>杜宇飛女士談歐遊感想</h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>匈牙利人最愛國，可作我們的榜樣！　德意女人最勤勞，男女平等的服務。</p>
<p>奧林匹克大會閉幕以後，國人千愁萬感，認爲中華體育史上平添一大汚點；尤其體育界人士，各抒所見，議論紛紜，雖至今尚未見有整個推進的計劃，然而大家旣有澈底醒悟，亡羊補牢，急起直追，决不會永遠失敗的。平心而論，像我國這積弱的民族，一切都趕不上人家，何况體育是一椿平凡的事呢！前幾天遇到中國女子體育師範校長杜宇飛女士，她此番曾隨體育考察團赴歐，耳聞目擊，頗多感慨，我便棵出幾點意見，承她逐一答復，下面就是對話的速寫：</p>
<p>「體育考察團赴歐的行程及路綫是怎樣的？」</p>
<p>「考察團共計三十七人，女八人，六月底出國，十月三日返滬，途中歷九十九天，經過意，德，奧，匈牙利，瑞典，丹麥，捷克，埃及，印度等九國，留德的時間較長，其餘的略觀光，宛如走馬看花而已。」</p>
<p>「女士對本屆奧林匹克的印象怎樣？」</p>
<p>「關於大會種種，報上發表得很詳盡，現在我把個人的印象貢獻一二：在海外覺得我國民族精神太差，各國人民一切行動，完全紀律化，國體爲重，個人爲輕；我們自愧不如。代表團失敗主因：第一我們體力不够，營養不足；第二缺乏長期訓練；第三缺少臨陣經騐，譬如籃球一項，技術不算壞，而球員們心慌意亂，莫知所措，失收之慘，遠出意外；第四運動員生活太浪漫，能守規律人太少；第五大家沒有責任心，不顧國家的體面，好像去的時候，運動員總說飲食不慣，你病他病，忙煞醫生，還鬧了許多笑話，一言難盡。到回國時，他們都興高采烈，對敗績竟毫無所感！你想：道還行麼？過去的算了，以後我們應該痛下功夫，下屆在日本開會，要說奪錦標，或者太奢望，我主張個人競技之外，團體表演，也很有意義。像此次大會，各國都有數千人的偉大表演，各式團體操及舞蹈等，有的表　民族尚武精神，有的發揚固有藝術，下屆我國也應參加團體表演。中國體育方針，應根本改革，先從家庭做起，使家長知兒童體育的重要性，養成他們冒險性，注重基本的訓練。我國人吃東西太好，但營養分少，故身體發育不平均，這也是大毛病。奧林匹克再下屆在意大利，算來還有八年，而意國已開始建造會塲，規模比德更大，道眞是未雨綢繆，辦事精神，至堪敬佩。」</p>
<p>「對於各國新興氣象，有何觀感？」</p>
<p>「我們此行，以考察各國體育爲目的，而風土國情，敎育制度，也聯帶注意。我個人認爲最滿意的，如丹麥人民生活的安逸，對外賓禮貌的莊重，在在表現人民程度之高超。丹麥强迫敎育，比各國都嚴格，六歲至十四歲兒童，幾乎全都受國民敎育的。瑞典人民，與丹麥相差不遠。德國的物質建設，最雄壯偉大。意大利民族，兇很得不可一世！捷克的民衆體育，最爲普及，每個人都受體育的洗醴，開運動會時，每有幾十萬人出塲表演，其熱烈可想而知。歐洲許多新興國家，人民的愛國思想，非常高漲，其中匈牙利人予我的印象最深，當我們離匈時，旅館某職員請代表團簽名，郝更生君寫着「錦繡山河，早歸故主，」八字，一經解釋，那職員立時吊下淚來，復國情緒之熱，無以復加。在匈京交通總樞紐處，有一公園，終年升着半旗，據說國土恢復後，纔升全旗。園中以花草綴成各式國恥標語，使人驚惕。四角立四石像，質地粗劣，面貌醜陋，表示四處失地，將來收復一地，打碎一像。還有郵政明信片的夾層裏，印有地圖，失地何處，一目瞭然，略舉數端，便可證明匈牙利人紀念國恥的深刻。返觀我國，失地更多，國恥更深，而國民救國愛國的思想，較匈人爲何如？再以新輿的德國而言，「茂興」（譯音）爲德第三大城）爲德革命發祥地，那裏建有國恥紀念堂，上置花圈六，旁建無名英雄墓，墓置桐棺八，也是紀念失地，追懷民族英雄的，德人經過此地，必舉手敬禮，表示尊重之意。」</p>
<p>「游歐後對各國婦女有何意見？」</p>
<p>「我所見各國婦女，衣服都很儉樸，尤以德意兩國，不在交際宴會塲中，簡直看不到高跟鞋，塗脂抹粉的，但她們體格很壯健，服務精神與男子無異。德國的勞工服務，不分男女，自十八歲起，必須入勞工團，服務一年，卽如本屆大會招待所及寄宿舍等，一切雜役，完全由男女學生分別担任，而且出身於中學大學的，做事非常認眞，其耐勞耐苦的精神遠非我國靑年所能企及的」</p>
<p>那天我們談的話很長，上面幾段，意義比較深長，值得向讀者作忠實的報道。</p>
<p>赴歐考察之五女團員，均係金陵女大校友，左第一人爲校長吳貽芳傳士，第三人卽杜女士。</p>

<h3>僑英十五歲網球花　何愛英小姐的球藝</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這一次中國的選手，參加世運結果，每項都是吃了湯糰，失敗同來，使人倒抽一口冷氣；可是另一面，我們却得到一個可喜的消息，便是僑居英國的中國小姐何愛英，伊的網球表演，有驚人的進步。道次除了爭得英國惠勃爾皇初級組冠軍而外，九月二十二日伊又榮膺法國女子組初級網球賽單打的冠軍。</p>
<p>何小姐今年還祇十五歲，伊的雙親老早就到英國經商的；因此，伊就在英國誕生的。伊從小就非常活潑，爲了伊的雙親，工作之餘，也歡喜打打網球，所以何女士從小就有打網球的機會而伊的球藝和伊的年齡一樣得以逐年的進步。不過伊有這樣的驚人球藝，一向在英國還沒有人發現直到前年，伊十三歲的一年，加入初級　比賽後，才有人發現這一顆僑英的中國網球花。</p>
<p>在過去兩年之中，何小姐在倫敦的確有過不少驚人的表演，因爲伊的人雖然這樣的嬌小而英國的女網球家，凡是　三等選手，都在伊手下敗過的。我們回想起來，本年四月，伊在倫敦參加梅爾勃萊網球會公開網球賽女子組單打賽開始角逐而後，英國的女選手，每個都被伊打敗直到進入决賽週之後才爲英國女網球家桃樂珊朗德女士所敗。本來朗德女士是英國第一流女網球選手，加着何女士的身體嬌小，就體力上也遠不及朗德女士，所以伊的失敗，原是意料中事，但在比賽的時候，伊却曾予朗德小姐以極大的威脅。</p>
<p>本年九月，伊在英國參加惠勃爾登女子單打，結果獲得冠軍，抱走大銀盃一隻；可是接着於九月二十二日，又以七比五，五比七，六比三勝過已黎女網球健將格莉妮爾而獲得法國初級網球的冠軍消息傳來，震動了全個歐洲的體育界人。伊的球藝，這樣一來，的確已爲歐洲網球專家所屬目凡是目睹伊的表演者，莫不相信伊的前途非常遠大。</p>
<p>就上面所說的情形看來，何小姐的球藝，在國內恐怕是找不出第二人吧？伊在國際方面，已爲中國人爭得不少體面，像這樣的女網球家，幾年之後，不難成爲第一流女選手。深望中國體育界主事人員，勿把這顆飄流在異國的女網球花忽視，如果能够使伊將來代表中國出席國際網球比賽，一定可以爲中國爭到榮譽因爲伊現在還祇有十五歲，在未來的幾年之中，球藝的進步，將有驚人的神速，可以預料的。無疑的伊的前途是最有希望的</p>
<h3>姙娠與營養</h3>
<p>— 子弗</p>
<p>所謂姙娠，卽是說，自那時起，母髒已不單祗營養自己的一個肉體，而同時却在養着一個生活力旺盛的新的生命了。因此，在這期間中的營養，不能不加以特別的注意。卽令營養良好，而孕婦於營養上亦往往會表現了不十二分優良的狀態。</p>
<p>於姙娠期中，有許多人會發生齒病。原因爲了造就胎兒的骨塊，於是將牙齒養分的石灰質奪去。石灰質不單可以營養牙齒，同時更具脊病菌抵抗力。母體的石灰質，旣爲胎兒奪去，因而母體的抵抗力减少。夏姙娠期中，一不小心，便極易罹結核等病。當孕婦體發微熱，有時就是結核初期的症候故必須卽行請醫師診斷</p>
<p>尤其是在夏秋之交，卽使一般普通入，大多數都呈腸胃抵抗力衰弱，食慾减退的現象。在這一時期中的姙婦，其抵抗力更爲襄　，　須尤良好的營養。多服食滋，料豐富的東西，注意衰弱預防的方法。以保持母體的健康。如　有營養不足的現象發生時，應卽由醫師診察，斷定體中缺乏何種養分。然後再由醫師指示，服用何種物品，方不致影饗於母體與胎兒的健康。然，這仍不能不算是一種補救的辦法。其實，最好於事先加以注意，多服含滋養料豐富而且平均的東西，使不致營養不足。</p>
<p>大概說來，爲了維持健康，預防衰弱所必需的營養，於日常的食品中，已可取得。不過，我人亦應注意，於日常食品中，多選擇營養優良的。而同時，不可偏食，須使各種養分有適當的分量。</p>
<p>還有一層須注意的，卽是須具有消化力與吸收力强的胃腸。欲胃腸的作用强盛，最好常服能强壯胃腸的組織細胞，活潑消化與吸收機能、的東西。能如是，而同時不偏食某一兩種物品。則必要的營養料，自可從日常的食物中攝到。</p>
<h3>下意識者（中）</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>不錯，劉一帆所辦的那一個雕刻工程司的確毫無生意，全仗他父親給他維持；而同時，他也的確沒有帥過女人的念頭。可是生意不好是一件事，不想　妻是又一件事，兩者之間，却並無如他一班親友所想的那樣密切的關係，因爲一帆　沒有錢，他父親却已幾次表示要資助他成親，而都給他自己反對掉；實在的原因是他還想努力研究他的雕刻，希望在藝術上多得幾許成就，爲了他的意識如此單純而又一直向上，於是他所見釗的只像一綫天一樣的一道微光，其他都看不到了。</p>
<p>但是又隔了半年模樣，下意識的行　就讓這位靑年藝術家表演出來了。</p>
<p>這一年春間，西北邊防司令劉××不幸追勦赤匪之役受傷陣亡，中央和當地的民衆對這位劉將軍過央都有好感，便决定在蘭州方面給他建立一座銅像，幾經選擇和投標，道筆生意居然落到了劉一帆的手裏來。他自然很與奮，隔了半年，就把模型和石座全準備好了，爲着節省運輸時的麻煩起見，他决意先把一切應用的材科派一個人過去，自己也隨後動身，打算把餘下的一部份工作移到蘭州去做。主意旣定，又喜他並無家眷，不須躭擱，便在一個秋日的上午，踏上了他的徑途。</p>
<p>先到西安，再換西蘭公路的長途汽車，因爲公路太糟的緣故，這種車子往往有時候開，有時候不開，一帆到西安的那一天，不巧公路上又出了一些毛病，公路局臨時通告停車，一帆祇得就在中國旅行社的西安招待所暫住，晚上沒事，很早便上坑睡了，不料睡至半夜突然給一種粗暴的聲浪所驚醒了，側耳一聽，似乎隔牆就有人在那裏動武，而且還夾着女人的哭聲。最初他還道是來了什麼土匪，不免很着慌，後來仔細一聽，裏面似乎還有人在勸解的聲音，而那女人的哭聲也不很急銳，和通常發生盜刦的情形不同，一帆這才定了心；可是那男的依舊拉直了一條粗啞的嗓子儘駡，女的也儘哭，委實敎一帆不能睡覺。隔了好半嚮，大槪帳房裏有人進去勸了一番，那一對男女的爭吵才告停止，可是天色已快亮了</p>
<p>第二天，汽車居然開了，一帆從招待所雇車往車站去的時候，看見有一個穿着軍裝的大胖子帶着一個女性也在後面喚車；到了車站，恰巧那大胖子也在買票，並且也是買的蘭州票，一帆原無注意他們的必要，也就視若無睹，可是聽那大胖子一開口，聲音倒是很熟，再一想，原來就是昨夜聽他駡過老婆的。</p>

<h3>十五年來的上海婦孺敎養院（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉王立明</p>
<p>發起的動機</p>
<p>中國婦女節制運動，發軔於五十年前，地點是在鎮江，這潮流自揚子江流域澎湃至黃浦江兩岸時，上海的婦女，便也有了許多節制會的組織，除滬南滬北等婦女節制會外，還有學生節制會，兒童節制軍。那時會長是石美玉醫生，幹事除梅雲英，劉景芳等女士外，還有我自己。這上海婦孺敎養院的發起，實與我發生極密切的關係，起初我在本會擔任的是靑年的工作。有一天，上海節制學生聯合會，在我事務所裏開討論會，我便說本會的靑年會員，除個人戒除烟，酒，賭，邪外，應大家團結起來，作點與社會眞正有益的工作。那時我方自海外歸來，見別國的街市，都見整整齊齊，便提議在上海創設一個婦孺敎養院，將街市上流飄着的一部份婦孺乞丐及其他人類中之不幸者，收容敎養，而作救丐運動的先聲，並予絕境者一條生路，靑年的感情，正如火一般的熱，經我倡導，大家舉手贊成，而上海婦孺敎養院，便在這時有了孕育</p>
<p>四百元的開辦費</p>
<p>創辦上海婦孺敎養院的原則是通過了，第二步工作便是起草章程，第三步困難的工作便開始了。大家模摸自己的衣袋，最多的也不過只有五塊錢，把這去創辦一個敎養院，至少須維持半年，這是如何的一件不可能的事啊！所以當主席提出討論預算的時候，大家都低着頭，有的也許在懊悔當初不該那麼興奮。</p>
<p>這時本人便立起來說：「我們無論作什麼事，只要有决心，總也可以辦得到的，像這種救丐的工作，本市同情的人，一定很多，我們舉行一個慈善遊藝會怎樣？」</p>
<p>希望，歡樂，奮勇的空氣又回到會議室了，不到十分鐘的討論，一個慈善遊藝會的舉行，便經大家决定了，並公推本人編一個話劇，其餘的節目，由他們自己擔任。</p>
<p>在上海娛樂的塲所冠於全國，在醉心外國電影及中國京戲的羣衆中，好容易舉行一個平凡的，而帶了慈善性質的遊藝會呀！</p>
<p>「旣打算作，就不要怕。」我又把這精神和會員們彼此勉勵最後是把明星公司裏的鄭鷓鴣，鄭正狄，兩先生及一大批演員們也請出來帮忙，後來主角找不着人，只好自己擔任。</p>
<p>五畝地新舞台是演戲的地點，票劵一共賣了九百元左右，但是付了三百元的戲台費，二百元的印刷，車資設備等費，在總淸的時候，結餘便只有四百元，就是上海婦孺敎養院的創辦費！</p>
<p>自西門江灣</p>
<p>古人說「創業難」，但是「守業」而發展之更是不易。熱心的靑年會員們，不到二三年的工夫，便遷徙的遷徙，就業的就業，升學的升學，出嫁的出嫁，所剩下來的，除本人而外，幾無第二人了。還幸這時主管機關——中華婦女節制恊會——本身，在組織上，有了巨大的變遷，由會長制而改爲董事制，我便乘機將會內工作亦加以改組，設立拒毒，齊家，救丐三部，而將上海婦孺敎養院隸屬於救丐部下，雖然現在因事業發達，名稱亦改爲社會服務部了。四百元用來創辦一所慈善機關，的確是一個極渺小的數目，但是爲貫澈他們的初衷及社會的信用，同人等更鼓起勇氣，在西門一貧民處，將這救丐的工具—一海婦孺敎養院——創辦起來了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言中日談判停頓  我　　全世界注目的中日談判問題，現在又見停頓，據二十一一日南京雷訊，日大使川越，二十一日訪張外長，繼續交換關於調整中日關係意見，因相距甚遠，故仍未一致，當擬約期談判，至川越下决與張外長會晤之期，現尚未能的定云云，此種談判在未談判之前，世人早已預料沒有圓滿的結果，因雙方意見，相差甚遠，苟非對方痛自澈底覺悟，一變其一貫的侵略政策，則此次之談判，將演變至如何程度，眞有不能使人逆料矣。　　此次兩國交涉的核心，卽據報紙所發表者而言，問題似頗簡單，而關係實屬電大（一）華北特殊化，（二）共同防共，所謂這兩個問題者，是何等之問題耶？華北爲我中華民國的領土，無論一尺之地，一寸之土，均非傍人所得而覬覦，卽華北之人民，均爲我中華民國之人民，亦决非外人所得而指揮與操縱，華北數省的主權，均屬於中華民國所有，更何待贅述，不知是何原因，而欲特殊起來？東北四省之地，自經九一八後，而變爲特殊矣，現在華北，又要特殊，萬一再有讓步，將非以全中國爲特殊之國家不可，試問此種交涉，尚有商量的餘地吾耶？　　至於防共與親共，各有其一國之國策與立塲之不同，而異其步驟，非特親共他人旣不容置喙，卽防共亦非他人所得而干預也，我國對於共產主義，本不相容，故自淸共以來，多歷年所，不但經濟兵力，消耗於勦共事業者，旣難以數字計，至今西北諸省，勦共工作，仍未稍暇，則所謂共同防共者是何說耶？且所謂共同防共者，是與日方通力合作，以抵抗蘇俄之謂，不知勦共爲一事，而防共又爲一事，勦共爲我國國內不能有兩種以上的主義的存在，防共與親共，爲我國考察外界之形勢，而定其外交之方針，亦决不能任何人所能左右之也　　總之現在之談判，不僅華北特殊化，與共同防共兩事而已，而其根本之差誤，對方絕少誠實的態度，一面川越大使在京，與張外長共同磋商，調整國交關係，而一面在華北自由行動，如飛機之自由翱翔，軍隊之自由駐紮，以及開發經濟，自由處置等等，諸如此類，完全沒有談判之誠意，其最初之目的，希望化零爲整，把華北諸省，整個的作爲特殊化，如談判不能融洽，仍欲以化整爲零，使造成旣成事實，卽可置諸談判於不顧，此種情形，我國人應當注意，卽當局諸公，亦應當格外注意，其間絲毫不能忽視者也。　　或者謂彼方溫和與激烈兩派之主張，意見未能完全一致，故此種舉動，完全出於激烈派之所爲，此種說數，亦安足以成立？凡一個國家，而不能自由表現其一致之意旨，而大權傍落，竟操縱於某一派人之手，試問此種國家，將成爲何等樣之現象？旣不問可知，又安知他們不借某一派人之行動，作爲外交之工具，而藉以達其無窮之大欲，則所謂某派云云，不過借此爲運用之途徑而已，故我謂一方面，固應折衝撙俎，用政治手腕解决，而另一方面，在華北之特殊舉動，决不容坐視，亦應有相當之懲創也。</p>

差不多，室中的設備也和蠶室相同；不過上簇時是用竹架支搭了簇棚，上面再舖以蘆簾，用一柄簇帚豎在簾上，預備撒佈老蠶。　　補肺強身：健腦益智　威靈麥精魚肝油　　二磅大瓶·一元五角·買一送一　　威靈麥精魚肝油，係用眞正鮮潔挪威鱉魚肝由，及眞空濃縮之大麥芽膏，和以芳香美味諸品，經由著名藥師調合而成，乃一最新補肺强身，補腦益智之良劑，兒童服之，允能助長發育？現爲普遍各界試服起見，特犧牲五萬瓶，作大規模的贈送，凡購買大號威　麥精魚肝油（二磅瓶），每瓶一元五角，買一瓶再送一瓶，電話購買請撥九二五二五，（經售處）先施，永安，大新，新新，各大公司西藥部，華美，南洋，濟華堂，天華，勤康，大中，大華，東方，蓬萊，華盛，美濟，美德，中德等藥房（批發）二馬路正威藥房石筆畫  芷夫　　是放學的時候了！那一羣小的羔羊們，挾着書本子，跳呀跳的，出了課堂，照例排成一隊，只待等先生嘴要的敎餾發了一聲長吼，再哼上一遍「再會歌」，就可無拘無束地，過他們的校外生活去了。　　剛離開校門，隊伍是平靜地，有紀律得很；可是一個轉彎抹角，那形勢就不得了啊！幾個臉膛上滿塗墨漬的脚色，頑皮起來，一會兒七歪八斜，突然却哇吱哇吱的唱起山歌來：　　「小學生子」小隊，　　將來多是大人才。　　我們不願做奴隸；　　只要揑起拳頭來！　　起來！團結一致，……　　打掉欺侮我們的××鬼！　　……………………」　　聲音像一面嘹喨的小鑼，儘管璣怪　怪的喊着：小隊長李中庸是個好學生，他聽到這歌聲，有點光火，可是沒奈何啊，想阻又阻他們不住，惟有大聲喝喊道：　　「不要唱，不要唱！再吵鬧，我明天去報告，你們不怕吃手底心嗎？………」　　然而憑他喊破嗓子，大家並不去理睬他。　　一個呌做陸小平的四年級學生，更其不得了啊！這回他跑到隊伍前面；向每個人不知說了些什麼，隨卽：「一，二，三…——」　　他喊了一個信號：　　跟着他的聲音，隊伍像瀉坍了塘隄一般，分了開來，有的走近牆壁去，有的，伏在地面上……拿起石筆，畫出各式圖畫來了。　　應錦良畫的是一隻飛機，機身半邊側斜下來，翼翅上寫了「中國號」三個字，離開一尺的牆下，還畫了個像秤錘子的東西。他自己看得很滿意，便拉開大嘴喊着人們：　　「六友，小平，來來，來瞧我的飛機呀！我的飛機拉巴巴啊！（就是投彈）」　（未完）</p>

<p>鄉村裏的故事  蘿澎　　天一黑，全村莊上的人們都入眠了，聽小見鷄鳴，牛啼，狗吠。只是屋外那幾株大樹枝上的幾隻寒鴉，因爲北風的侵襲；伏在窩裏，不斷地撲着翅膀。　　王老頭兒獨自個兒地坐在房里，吸着旱烟筒，不時地用手摸摸他那發光的腦袋。他的眼睛視着窗外那菜園內一畦一畦的綠得發亮的肥大的靑菜。心中想：明天該要和兒子一道將它挑上鎭去求售了。」　　後房內兒子媳婦的牛似的鼾聲呼呼地傳到他的耳膜內來·王老頭不禁嘻嘻地笑了，隨接很快地將衣服脫得精光，一下子鑽進被窩內去睡了。　　王老媽媽獨自個兒地坐在堂屋內的菜油燈下紡棉紗，不時地將腦袋伸過來，望望房內王老頭子的動靜，一直到他脫光了衣服上了床，無聲無息的了。她這才放下了手中的紡綫，吹熄了燈，輕手輕脚地踱到房內來。　　她脫去了外衣偸偸地鐵進了被窩中，彷彿怕驚動了王老頭子似的。但是機警的王老頭子，不待她睡下就那樣精明地哼了一聲，隨接他好像感到什麼似的，將腦袋稍爲抬了一點起來，怪嚴峻地說道：「哼！你又不脫去外衣睡覺嗎？」他睜着一對圓滑溜的眼睛盯着王老媽媽：「你知道布賣多少錢一尺呀？」　　王老媽媽不響，翹起了一個猪似的嘴巴，鑽進了被窩裏面。　　這幾天王老媽媽脫光了衣服睡覺受了一點凉，所以今天她想穿着短衫褲睡覺了。他一生就從未穿着衣服睡過一夜覺，穿若夜服他也睡不着。「唉，我一生該和你拳了多少鐵（註）呀！呌你不穿衣服睡覺，你總不相信，」王老頭兒恨恨地說。　　「你這老不要臉的，替我少說一句，兒子媳婦聽見了不怕醜呀」　　「你怕醜，你怕醜就該脫去了衣服睡覺呀！看你一年穿破了我的多少衣服，哼！」他停了一停：「老不懂事的！」　　「看那個老不懂事，看那個老不要臉……」王老媽媽聲勢凶凶地爭辯着，突然屋外傳來了一陣狗吠聲，打斷了她的話，由遠而近，吠聲是那樣地尖銳和恐佈，彷彿竄似的震撼了老女人的全身的神經，她的腦膜內映進了一個可怕的强盜的印像。這臘月夜晚的狗吠聲，若使每個人感到心驚肉跳。王老媽媽忍住了呼吸，將被窩緊緊地包住了腦袋。　　可是，王老頭兒吸，他好像沒有感到這些似的，只一個勁地嚷着睡不着覺和布賣幾錢一尺。　　王老媽媽可急了，她顫抖着聲音哀求道：我的爹爹不要鬧好媽？聽外面有狗吠聲，開頭（註）怕又有强盜來了！」　　一下了，像在火頭上潑上了一盆油似的，王頭子氣得更凶了：「强盜來了，强盜來了怕個卵，老子亦沒沒有三百四百給他搶，呌他莫來！」屋外的狗吠聲吠得更極迫了，漸漸地王老頭子也感到這聲音後面所隱伏着的危機了。他想起了他菜園內的菜來：「這雜種狗吠得這凶，不是强盜來了，就是開頭的馬放到村莊上來了，牠該不會呌了我的菜園內的菜吧？　　他自言自語地說着，一下子就坐起身來，披上了一件大棉襖，連袴子也來不及穿，就向着屋外跑。　　村子頭上蹲着五六匹狗，一致地對原野中狂吠着。他躲在一株大樹的背後，靜靜地對原野中巡視着，在不遠處的小路上彷彿有一隻燈火在搖幌着。突然碰的一聲饗，槍彈的火光劃過了天際。驚起了林雀，都紛紛地離開了樹梢。全村莊上的入都像被野貓尋着了窩的士揆鼠似的亂竄了，誰也來不及穿上衣服。　　到鷄呌了五六遍的時候，他們才回到了家中。王老頭兒看自己僅有的一條棉袴和一條單袴都被搶去了。　　他心中想明天該要穿着王老媽媽的袴子上鎭去賣菜了。　　註一：「拳鐵」，卽　嘴的意思。註二：「開頭」爲原野。十五歲的賣花姑娘是個兼職賣淫者  胡考作漁汛　（續）  允海　　船上幾個伙計，都是老三認得的。他們客氣地跟老三打交道，可是，說話一牽到老三這趟的命運時，便像的定了一般地保守緘默了。老三，才坐了一會，眼睛從那大大小小的網罟又溜回了自己的寒酸的身上時，覺得不好意思，道一個別，又走上了岸來。　　漁汛的情景，還在很殘酷地敲着老三的腦袋。不久以前，他老三還是一個給人尊敬的人物，現在，便給淘汰了，給踢翻了。大洋海上翻跳着的魚影，已變成了若干針刺般地向他射擊；孕滿了風的帆，很迅速地追着魚踪，撒下一把大網，打個七八十斤的好景，他老三也曾嚐過。然而，這一切，現在只留了在夢里去想了。那給老三的手汗滲得光滑到可以看見人的舵柄，如今已換了一個靑壯的舵手了。　　在岸上，迎着風，老三痴呆地站着。好一會兒了，大槪是到了開船的時候吧，那邊顚顚跛跛地走來了那新來的船老大了。這人的脾氣很壞，聽說是東家的娘家親，靠水吃飯一點也不慣，這次不過因爲船老大老福爹上了吊，才要了他來代替的。他，這恃勢的傢伙，只會吆喝：　　「冚家剷——開船了，還是一碌七一樣在那里閒着！死契弟，去啦，扯帆咧，解纜咧—那媽個×，你，還不撑篙！」　　老三在岸上看得有點憤激了，看着這不熟練的，作威作福的傢伙，他心里奇妙地不知在怎樣地想着的。　　漁船在吆喝和敲打聲中，離岸慢慢地遠了。直至象條細錢那末一個影子，老三才垂下了頭。　　他哭了，他迷自己也不明白地哭。　　太陽漸漸地躱到山巴里去了。村里零落的烟囱已經忽的吹起了炊烟。老三拖着鞋跟，帶着抑　，走上回家的黃泥路上來了。（完）</p>

<h3>Tensions Rise Again Between China and Japan: The Key to Breaking the Impasse Lies with Japan; Ambassador Xu Visits Arita for Three-Hour Talks; Suma Carries Important Two-Point Proposals for Instructions; The Japanese Military Takes a Firm Stance, Advocating a Wait-and-See Approach</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) My Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence at 2 p.m. on the 23rd for nearly three hours of talks. Ambassador Xu, following government instructions, sincerely explained to the Japanese Foreign Minister the reasons why the Chinese government could not accept some of the proposals made by Japan and asked the Japanese Foreign Minister to reconsider Japan's attitude. The Japanese Foreign Minister also sincerely stated Japan's position. It was decided that Ambassador Xu would repeatedly and clearly explain the points that China must insist on to the Japanese Foreign Minister before departing. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Consul General Suma will return to Tokyo on the afternoon of the 24th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Three-Minister Conference will convene on the evening of the 24th or the 25th to make a decision. Negotiations in Nanjing will be held again only after Suma returns to his post. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The sixth meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Kawagoe regarding Sino-Japanese negotiations has not yet been scheduled and remains in a lull. At 10 a.m. on the 23rd, Japanese Embassy Secretary Shimizu visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for half an hour of talks. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Xu Shiying, the Ambassador of the Republic of China to Japan, visited Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence at 2 p.m. on the 23rd, following instructions from the Nanjing government. The meeting lasted two and a half hours, ending at 4:30 p.m. (Rengo News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sino-Japanese negotiations have become tense again in the past two days. The final attitude of the Japanese government must await Consul General Suma's return to Tokyo before it can be decided, which has led to various rumors and speculations that are difficult to believe. Japan now clearly holds the key to whether the current impasse can be broken. In other words, Japan is currently at a crossroads, choosing between adhering to its serious determination and ordering a complete break, or maintaining its established policy and seeking a compromise through diplomatic channels. General observation believes that the wisest approach for Japan would be to avoid an unnecessary break. According to reliable sources from the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, the Japanese government's position is roughly as follows: although the North China and anti-communist issues are part of Japan's original plan, they can also be resolved by other means, so there is still room for a review of the overall plan. However, Japan is unwilling to be bound by any agreement on the above issues. Japan is determined to reject any counter-proposals from China. Regarding Japan's demands on the North China and anti-communist issues, Japan's purpose is only to obtain general assurances from the National Government so that the current government will not encounter obstacles when implementing its national policy. According to a special dispatch from the newspaper in Nanjing, the Consul General is carrying two important proposals to return to Tokyo to submit to the authorities for consideration and to seek instructions from the authorities. The first point is that since China and Japan have no hope of fully understanding the North China and anti-communist issues, the result will inevitably lead to a deep rift in the opinions of the two countries. Therefore, the direction of the various plans adopted should be reconsidered, and clear and specific restrictions should be placed on Japan's plans. The second point is that since avoiding a break in negotiations is deemed necessary, simply delaying it is also not advisable. Therefore, a temporary conclusion should be reached on the current negotiations in the near future, and all important matters should be left for future negotiations. The Nanjing special dispatch of the newspaper also stated that the opinion of Japanese officials in China is unanimously that the current negotiations should not be stopped. According to the above news, it is generally believed here that it is extremely reliable. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Suma Returns Home: Negotiations Should Not Be Suspended; Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman States; Gao Zongwu Visited Ambassador Kawagoe Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman told a special correspondent of the Central News Agency on the 23rd that Sino-Japanese negotiations should not be suspended during Consul General Suma's return to the country. The spokesman also said that a personal report by diplomatic personnel is much better than telegrams back and forth. Suma's return to the country and Kuwashima's trip to China have the same reason. He also said that Suma will only stay in Tokyo for a few days before returning to his post. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Embassy Secretary Shimizu visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and left shortly after a brief conversation. Director Gao also visited Ambassador Kawagoe at the Japanese Embassy at 3 p.m. for about two hours before departing. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Consul General Suma of Nanjing will arrive in Tokyo on the 24th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will immediately hold an important conference. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Nagasaki: Suma, the Consul General of Nanjing, who is carrying an important mission, returned to the country on the Nagasaki Maru at 1:15 p.m. on the 23rd. At 2:45 p.m., he transferred to a special express train to Tokyo. On board, he told reporters that the sole purpose of this return to the country was to report on the local situation in China to Foreign Minister Arita. Whether or not he will carry government instructions to return to his post will depend on the outcome of the meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, arrived in Nagasaki at 1:15 p.m. on the 23rd and immediately transferred to a train to Tokyo at 2:45 p.m. It is reported that Suma told reporters that he had nothing to report regarding the Nanjing negotiations before reporting to the government. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers' Views: Attitudes Clearly Inconsistent; Most Advocate Following Diplomatic Channels to Promote the Success of Negotiations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is clearly difficult to speculate on the reasons for Consul General Suma's decision to come to Tokyo from Nanjing in the Japanese newspapers. Most newspapers believe that Japanese diplomats in China have advocated revising Japan's demands, especially regarding the North China and anti-communist issues. Otherwise, the negotiations between China and Japan may have broken down long ago. The newspapers also stated that it is the duty of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to show a spirit of compromise to promote the success of negotiations between the two countries through diplomatic channels. Another part of the newspapers claimed that when Suma returns to his post, he will carry new instructions from the Japanese side to Ambassador Kawagoe, ordering him to maintain an uncompromising attitude. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is quite angry at China's "delaying" tactics and is determined to overcome them. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that Ambassador Kawagoe had notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that if the Japanese side insisted that China must accept all its demands, the negotiations might break down one day. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita decided to express a spirit of compromise as the only way to resolve the outstanding issues between China and Japan. However, the army and navy authorities will oppose the revision of Japan's demands. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun's view is that the Japanese government must choose between abandoning the diplomatic method of resolving outstanding issues and revising Japan's demands. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita visited Prime Minister Hirota yesterday to ask him to endorse the compromise policy. The newspaper also stated that the Japanese army and navy may not be willing to support this policy. The Asahi Shimbun said that the demands made by the Japanese government to the Chinese government are a whole and cannot be separated. If China does not fully accept the spirit revealed in the demands, Japan will never make any concessions. Japan's attitude has not changed and will resolutely refuse to accept conditions that would restrict Japan's future actions in China. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Investing in and Developing North China: Japanese Financial Circles Maintain a Wait-and-See Attitude; The Japanese Military Has Approved Economic Cooperation Methods; the Huitong Company Held an Inaugural Meeting in Peiping Yesterday</h3>

He was inconvenient to predict, so as to avoid misunderstandings. He will come and go between Peiping and Tianjin at any time in the future depending on the complexity of the affairs. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding Sino-Japanese navigation, on the surface, the Japanese side is the Japan-Manchukuo Aviation Company, and the behind-the-scenes host is Lieutenant Colonel Higuchi of the Aviation Department of the North China Japanese Army. As of the 23rd, Tianjin has not yet learned the exact date of the establishment of the Huitong Company in Tianjin.

<h3>Japanese Army in Peiping and Tianjin: Drill Procedures; Japanese Side Agrees to Rebuild Civilian Houses</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Imai said that the Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, Tianjin, Fengtai, and other places will conduct a large-scale exercise for ten days from the 26th to November 4 in the Yongding River in western Peiping and along the Peiping-Hankou Railway.

<h3>Gao Bingfang Discusses Smooth Progress of Income Tax; Provincial and Municipal Tax Collection Committees Established</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Bingfang stated that since the implementation of the income tax, special commissioners dispatched by the Ministry to various provinces and cities have reported that the progress is extremely smooth. Authorities in Hubei, Shandong, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Qingdao, among other provinces and cities, convened meetings with business and industry representatives upon the arrival of the Ministry's commissioners to fully exchange views on collection procedures. Some representatives from business and industry in various locations raised concerns about the overlap between the collection of income tax on profits and business tax. After the commissioners explained the matter, all objections were resolved. It has also been decided that the province of Guizhou will implement collection as planned. The income tax collection agencies in various provinces and cities will be named the Income Tax Collection Committee, jointly organized by the central and local governments. It is expected to be formally established at the end of January or the beginning of December. Personnel previously recruited to handle direct tax work will undergo three more weeks of training before being assigned to service. In addition, according to a notice from the Central Bank, income tax payments have already been submitted this month by agencies such as the Salt Revenue Audit Office and the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau. By the end of the month, all agencies nationwide should be able to make payments in accordance with the law. In the future, the collection procedures for income tax on profits from business operations and interest income on deposits, as well as methods for improving old-style bookkeeping, will be regularly reviewed by the Accountants Association and the Bankers Association, who will submit opinions to the Ministry for reference.

<h3>Legislative Yuan: Yesterday's Regular Meeting; No Need to Amend Maritime Law Provisions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 77th meeting on the morning of the 23rd, with 49 members including Wang Kunlun in attendance. Ye Chucang presided. Regarding the Executive Yuan's consultation on amending Article 23 of the Maritime Law, it was resolved to adopt the results of the review by the Commercial Law Committee and not to make any amendments. The reason is that the article stipulates that the liability of a shipowner for the removal of a shipwreck is limited to the value of the vessel, freight, and other incidental expenses at the time of the voyage. The Inspector General of Customs believed that, with this limitation, when acting on behalf of the government to remove a shipwreck, only the proceeds from the sale of the ship, freight, and other incidental expenses could be seized, and there would be no right to seize salvaged goods. In the future, the source of funds to compensate for customs' advances for salvaging shipwrecks would be limited, and losses would be inevitable. Therefore, it was proposed to amend the article to include salvaged goods in the provisions. The matter was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and then to the Executive Yuan for review. The Commercial Law Committee of the Executive Yuan concluded that the provision stipulated the shipowner's financial liability, which is the so-called limited liability property. If such liability property is non-existent, the ship's creditor cannot request enforcement against other property owned by the shipowner, let alone goods that were not originally owned by the shipowner. Therefore, if the Customs fulfills its public duty by salvaging goods when removing a shipwreck and incurs expenses, it has the right to request compensation from the owner of the goods in accordance with Article 176 of the Civil Code, which pertains to management of affairs without mandate. As for the shipwreck removal expenses that should be recovered from the shipowner's liability property, there is no reason to directly seize the goods owned by the owner of the goods to cover the expenses. The Yuan's meeting unanimously agreed with this review result and passed the motion as it stood. As for the three cases of amending the Insurance Law, the Insurance Business Law, and formulating the Insurance Business Implementation Law, the Yuan's meeting accepted Ma Yinchu's temporary motion and postponed further discussion.

<h3>Outlook on the Spanish Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The decisive battle between the two major forces of the Spanish People's Front and the Fascist Front, both with international backgrounds, has been ongoing for three months since its outbreak. Currently, the anti-government forces led by Fascist leader General Franco, with the strong support of European Fascist countries, have directly approached the western capital, Madrid. The government forces of the People's Front are actively constructing defensive works in the capital, preparing for a desperate defense. The people in the capital are also constantly marching and demonstrating, with women encouraging men to go to the front lines to fight the anti-government forces for a final victory. The brutal battle for Madrid is imminent.</p>
<p>Following the rapid military advances of the Spanish anti-government forces, more international conspiracies have been discovered. The Spanish National Confederation of Labor has found that the anti-government forces secretly signed agreements with Germany and Italy at the beginning of the rebellion, promising to cede the island of Menorca and the northern part of Morocco to Germany and Italy after the success of the rebellion, and to distribute some spoils to Portugal as a reward for their assistance. Although Germany, Italy, and Portugal established an agreement of non-interference in the Spanish turmoil, they have continuously provided the anti-government forces with manpower and material assistance. Recently, the Berlin talks between Germany and Italy are likely to reach a concrete decision on the issue of recognizing the anti-government forces' government. The French People's Front government is very sympathetic to the Spanish government forces. Léon Blum spent tremendous effort to promote the non-interference agreement in the Spanish turmoil in order to prevent Italy, Germany, and other countries from assisting the anti-government forces. Britain was originally willing to support the anti-government forces to maintain its economic interests, but was greatly alarmed after hearing the news that the anti-government forces had secretly signed agreements with Germany, Italy, and other countries. Because if the matters stipulated in the secret agreement were realized, its hegemony in the Mediterranean would be greatly shaken. Therefore, it echoed France's proposal to promote the non-interference agreement to threaten the anti-government forces. According to a Havas news agency speculation, the anti-government forces seem to have provided satisfactory guarantees to Britain in response to this threat, so Britain is unwilling to make further expressions.</p>
<p>Since Germany, Italy, and Portugal have violated the non-interference agreement, and Britain is hiding behind the shield of the non-interference agreement, standing idly by, it is no wonder that the Soviet Union, which sympathizes with the Spanish People's Front, is protesting, pointing out that the non-interference agreement is a smokescreen for aggressor countries to assist the anti-government forces, and demanding that the Adjustment Committee effectively stop Germany, Italy, Portugal, and other countries from assisting the anti-government forces, otherwise it will consider withdrawing from the agreement and restoring free action. So far, the Soviet Union's protest does not seem to have had a significant effect. On the 22nd, French Foreign Minister Delbos stated in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, "If the development of the situation in Spain results in the Soviet Union being drawn into the vortex of war, France does not have any mutual assistance obligations to the Soviet Union. Because according to the provisions of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, mutual assistance is only obligatory when the territory of one of the contracting parties is attacked. As for the current position of the French government on the Spanish issue, it does not intend to make any changes." From this, it seems that even France, which has common interests with the Soviet Union, is very indifferent to the Soviet Union's protest.</p>
<p>The Adjustment Committee convened a meeting yesterday to discuss concrete guarantees for non-interference in the Spanish turmoil. Judging from past experience, this meeting is unlikely to have any concrete results. At present, the Soviet Union has reached a major juncture where it will either stop Germany, Italy, and other countries from assisting the anti-government forces or withdraw from the agreement and take free action. Germany, Italy, and other countries are bound to continue to adopt a method of outward compliance and inward opposition to perfunctorily deal with Britain and France. The development of this situation is likely to trigger a direct conflict between the two major forces of the left and right internationally.</p>
<h3>Confrontation Between Left and Right Groups, Latent European Crisis, Countries Employ Diplomatic Strategies, Clear Distinction Between Pro-German and Pro-Russian Stances</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The foreign ministers of Germany and Italy are still discussing today in a dangerous atmosphere where a conflict between fascist countries and leftist countries is about to occur. The foreign ministers of other European countries are also traveling east and west, doing their best in diplomatic strategies. Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu returned to the capital of Yugoslavia today for diplomatic discussions. It is reported that Yugoslavia has been notified that Romania intends to abandon the French-Russian group and cooperate with Central European countries. At the same time, Romanian King Carol is also preparing to go to the capital of Czechoslovakia to discuss the relationship between the Little Entente countries and Russia and Germany. Czechoslovakia has a military alliance with the Soviet Union, so its politicians may persuade King Carol to improve his relations with Russia. However, judging from the situation in various quarters, Romania seems to have been deeply influenced by Germany. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has accepted the invitation of Britain today and will go to London for diplomatic talks. Czech Foreign Minister Krofta declared to his parliament today that Czechoslovakia cannot follow the actions of Belgium, because if Czechoslovakia does not ally with other countries, it will not be able to resist any attack. Krofta also denied that Czechoslovakia is willing to be a Soviet air base so that it can attack Central Europe, and also does not want to join the fascist group or the anti-fascist group. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a speech at the American Club in Paris today, praising the United States' efforts to maintain world peace, and saying that European countries should follow the example of the United States and strive for peace.

<p>(London) Official sources stated that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will visit Britain in mid-next month and will be officially received by the British government. Foreign Secretary Eden invited Beck to visit Britain six months ago. Recently, when Eden met with Beck in Monte Carlo, he reiterated his previous invitation, which was accepted by Beck. Political figures believe that Beck's visit is sufficient to prove the close friendship between Britain and Poland, and Poland's attitude towards Germany and Russia can also be explored on this occasion, and further steps can be taken to reduce Poland's reserved attitude towards Russia so that</p>
<h3>Results of the Berlin Talks, Italy and Germany Reach a Compromise, Officially Signing Various Documents, Close Political and Economic Cooperation, Italian Foreign Minister Visits Hitler</h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the talks conducted by Count Ciano in Berlin, the semi-official Roman Popolo di Roma recently reported that the diplomatic authorities of Italy and Germany will sign various documents today to make the understanding reached by both parties official in nature. These documents have long been prepared through diplomatic channels. After Foreign Minister Ciano conducted talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath in Berlin, they have become finalized. Italy and Germany have reached an agreement in accordance with the following foundations: (1) The number of signatories to the future Locarno Treaty and their responsibilities should be limited; (2) Italy and Germany should form a passive joint front on the affairs of the League of Nations; (3) Regarding the Austrian issue, efforts should be made to prevent other countries from alienating Italy and Germany; (4) Italy and Germany should recognize the National Army government in Burgos, Spain, and prevent the establishment of a communist independent republic in the autonomous region of Catalonia, Spain. In addition, it is reported that General Milch, the head of the German Aviation Department, recently visited Italy and reached an agreement with the Italian authorities stipulating that both parties should jointly operate aviation routes in the Far East and open the Addis Ababa aviation route in East Africa, which will be operated by German Zeppelin airships. (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano held talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath today for an hour. The content was never revealed, and even newspapers did not make a single comment. It is said that the reason for the absolute secrecy of the talks between the two foreign ministers this time is that Ciano could not make any final decisions before going to Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler. Although the negotiations are currently being conducted in Berlin, the results must be approved by Hitler before the conclusion of an Eastern European Pact and the improvement of the mutual financial and commercial relations between Poland and Russia is not impossible. (Havas, 22nd) Moreover, in the negotiations between Germany and Italy, Germany is striving to avoid causing anxiety in Britain. This is also one of the reasons for the secrecy of the talks. However, according to Italian sources here, the negotiations are satisfactory and both sides are very sincere. (Havas Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano held talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath twice, each lasting only an hour. The relationship is exploratory in nature and cannot be regarded as a final decision. As for what Ciano should discuss with German Aviation Minister General Göring, the newly appointed "Four-Year Plan Dictator," the main focus is on the issue of economic cooperation between Italy and Germany. In addition, Ciano also held talks with German Propaganda Minister Goebbels this afternoon, which must be very important, because Goebbels had a long discussion with Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday and only returned here this morning. (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Key Points of the Talks Reported in Rome</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, the key points of the talks made by Foreign Minister Ciano during his visit to Berlin with key figures in the German political circles are as follows: (1) Italy and Germany do not intend to conclude a military alliance or military-related articles; (2) Both countries jointly recognize the National Army government in Burgos, Spain; (3) Italy will support Germany's proposal to conclude a Franco-German pact, which will be guaranteed by Britain and Italy; (4) Italy and Germany should support each other in their attitude towards the League of Nations; (5) Germany requires major powers not to interfere in Eastern European affairs and to include the Soviet Union outside the Locarno Treaty, which will be supported by Italy; (6) Italy and Germany should reach an understanding on the distribution of economic forces in the Danube River basin; (7) Germany does not intend to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia for the time being. It is also reported that Ciano will deliver an important speech in Germany this Sunday to attract the attention of international public opinion. (Havas Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Ciano's Banquet in Germany is Every Day</p>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited the Military Museum under the Linden today, and in the evening, Italian Ambassador to Germany Attolico hosted a banquet at the embassy, inviting all members of the German cabinet, National Socialist Party, and military figures to attend. Tomorrow, Ciano will be accompanied by Aviation Minister Göring to visit the newly built aviation school in Gatow near Berlin. At noon, he will attend a banquet hosted by Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, and in the afternoon, he will go to the "Fascist Club" to be entertained by Italian expatriates, and Ciano will deliver a speech. Tomorrow evening, Ciano will take a train to Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler and immediately begin talks. On Saturday afternoon, Ciano will go to Salzburg and return to Rome after meeting with press representatives. (Havas Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germany, Italy, Portugal Counter-Accuse the Soviet Union, of Violating the Non-Intervention Agreement, Submitting Replies Listing Facts, Adjustment Committee Convened Yesterday, Russian Representative May Withdraw</h3>
<p>(London) It has become inevitable that the Soviet Union will abandon the Non-Intervention Agreement and withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee. The Soviet Union has repeatedly protested that the committee is delaying meetings, so a meeting will be held tomorrow, at which time the Soviet Union will probably withdraw from the neutrality agreement. The Italian Embassy announced today that Italy will respond to the Madrid government's claim that Italy has violated neutrality at the committee meeting tomorrow. Portugal has also notified Sir Plymouth, Chairman of the Committee, that Portugal will also submit a reply within days. Germany sent a note to the Committee listing eight facts about the Soviet Union's violation of neutrality, and claiming that the Madrid government fabricated evidence to falsely accuse Germany of violating the agreement. As for the eight facts about Russia's violation of neutrality alleged by Germany, they are: (1) A Soviet steamer flew a foreign flag and unloaded munitions near Barcelona; (2) On September 12, 60 Soviet machine guns and anti-aircraft guns were shipped to Madrid; (3) In September, 37 Soviet aircraft and 30 aviators arrived in Spain; (4) There were four Soviet bombers at the Madrid Getafe airfield; (5) A British ship recently unloaded Soviet munitions in Alicante; (6) On September 25, a Russian ship arrived in Alicante, claiming to be transporting food, but in fact carried 12 Soviet pilots; (7) On October 4, a Russian ship unloaded munitions and food in Alicante; (8) On October 16, 50 Soviet tanks and 94 drivers were transported to Cartagena. The note also cited broadcasts from Barcelona and Moscow to prove Soviet aid to the Spanish left. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government has sent a reply to London regarding the Soviet Union and Spain's accusations that Italy has violated the Non-Intervention Agreement on the Spanish Civil War. The text of the reply is the same as the German government's reply, completely denying the accusations and separately sending an official document to the Non-Intervention Committee, listing the various incidents of the Soviet Union's violation of the agreement to counter-accuse the Soviet Union. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Lisbon Portugal, in response to the Soviet Union's accusation of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement on the Spanish Civil War, sent a military seaplane to deliver its written reply to London in order to catch the emergency meeting of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee this afternoon. It is reported that Portugal's attitude is the same as that of Germany and Italy, rejecting all the Soviet Union's accusations and further accusing the Soviet Union of actively assisting the Spanish government. Furthermore, according to news from Paris, the Soviet delegation may withdraw from the meeting today, and it is said that the Soviet Union is about to withdraw from the Non-Intervention Agreement. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin met with Sir Plymouth, Chairman of the Non-Intervention Agreement Adjustment Committee, at the British Foreign Office to discuss the agenda for the committee's meeting this afternoon and the replies from Germany and Italy to the Soviet Union's accusations of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement. Britain and France are now earnestly trying to prevent the collapse of the committee. If the Soviet Union decides to withdraw, then the collapse is inevitable, because once the Soviet Union withdraws, Germany, Italy, and other countries will be blatantly uninhibited in openly assisting the Spanish rebels. As a result, European countries will be divided into two opposing countries. In addition to receiving the replies from Italy and Germany denying the Soviet Union's accusations and counter-accusing the Soviet Union, the committee will also submit an official document from Britain this afternoon, which is said to clarify that the purpose of the establishment of the committee is to investigate accusations of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement, and should not be divided because someone has made this accusation.

<h3>Southwest of the Capital, Government Forces Counterattack, Rebel Forces Retreat to the Second Line of Defense, Aircraft Drop Bombs in the Suburbs of the Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid Special dispatch from our correspondent with the army on the front line southwest of the capital. After the National Army occupied the town of Navalagamella yesterday, the government forces have now begun a counterattack and have repelled the National Army to the second line of defense. Several aircraft belonging to the government forces have also driven away enemy aircraft. The National Army is deeply afraid that the government forces will continue to counterattack and is now using the defensive works previously built by the government forces to actively consolidate the line of defense. These defensive works are very strong, with trenches crisscrossing, each section having underground bomb shelters, machine gun positions, as dense as beehives, and wire fences intertwined to cover them. It is expected that there will be another fierce battle there. In addition, south of the city of Toledo on the southern side of the capital, the National Army attempted to cut off the railway between Madrid and Ciudad Real, but was valiantly repelled by the government forces. Many militiamen were killed in this battle. (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid Today, Madrid experienced its first daytime air raid. Aircraft of the Spanish National Revolutionary Army flew over the western capital twice. The aircraft did not drop bombs in the city, but it was heard that several bombs had fallen in the suburbs. In order to avoid being hit by anti-aircraft guns, the flight was extremely high and quite fast. It is believed that the purpose of this air raid was to scare the residents of the city and make them launch a demand for surrender. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Talavera According to a communique issued by the rebels, after the National Army continued to gain victories, it is now approaching Madrid. It is heard that the rebels have occupied the Tielmes Pass northwest of the capital. Government forces on the Guadalajara front northeast of the capital are said to be retreating completely. At the same time, the column led by General Franco has besieged the town of Móstoles, 12 miles southwest of the capital. Government forces recently set up a second line of defense there. The rebel artillery bombarded the government forces' positions again today in preparation for an infantry assault. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Catalonia Province, Decides on a Political Program, Implements a Collective Production System, Unifies Military Orders to Fight the Enemy to the Death</h3>
<p>Barcelona Representatives of various trade unions, the Unified Socialist Party, and the Anarchist Federation of Catalonia have signed a common political program, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Capitalist enterprises, except for small industries, will be confiscated without compensation and converted into collective production systems. Subsidies will be given when confiscating enterprises run by foreigners; (2) All real estate in the territory will be nationalized, but small real estate is not included; (3) Military orders will be unified throughout the enemy, so as to continue to fight a desperate battle with the rebels; (4) Militias will be formed to force the people to serve, and war industries will be created; (5) All farmland may be subject to the collective production system, and those who do not wish to adopt this system will be allowed to do so; (6) A vocational group system will be implemented; (7) All banks will be nationalized.

<h3>Rebel Leader, Wins Over Hearts and Minds, Explains Future Political Program, Seeks Welfare for Farmers and Workers</h3>
<p>Burgos General Franco, leader of the National Army government, recently gave an interview to our correspondent, explaining the political program of the National Army government, stating, "The National Army government is a government that serves the people and should support the middle class and the poor. It is extremely wrong to say that we want to protect the privileges of capitalism. In the future, the wages of workers in various industries will be proportional to the factory's surplus, and the living standards of workers will also be improved within the scope permitted by the national economy. As for farmland, the National Army government plans to establish a 'family property' system, in which all farmland must be inherited entirely by the most talented descendants, instead of being distributed to all descendants, in order to avoid the fragmentation of land.

<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires, Still Stationed in Madrid</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible sources recently revealed that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain will continue to be stationed in the capital, Madrid. Even if the troops of General Franco, leader of the National Army government, occupy Madrid, the British Chargé d'Affaires will still be stationed there and establish a de facto relationship with the National Army government. Unless the situation in the capital is extremely dangerous, the British Chargé d'Affaires will never leave his post lightly. Personnel at the British Consulate in Barcelona stated that British diplomats will continue to be stationed in the city, but if the Autonomous Region of Catalonia is reorganized into a Catalonian Soviet Republic, it will not be recognized.

<h3>Urgent Meeting of French Radical Party Passes Report on National Defense; Party Leader Urged to Unite to Uphold Democracy</h3>
<p>Biarritz, France – At the Radical Socialist Party's national congress in Biarritz, held this morning, retired General Demay (who served as a military advisor to Yuan Shikai's government in China and advocated for the establishment of a gendarmerie) presented a report on national defense. His proposals included: (1) urging the parliament to immediately pass legislation to complete the national organization law for wartime; (2) strictly defending the passage between the Jura Mountains (bordering Switzerland) and the cities of Huningue and Belfort (a shortcut from Germany to France); (3) expediting naval construction; and (4) increasing the proportion of the air force budget. The congress passed this report and a motion praising the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, Dala, for his achievements in safeguarding the republican system and reforming national defense. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Biarritz, France – The Radical Socialist Party's national congress opened here today. Two aspects were particularly noteworthy: (1) disputes arose between supporters and opponents of the Popular Front, almost leading to disturbances; (2) Dala, the Radical Socialist Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, solemnly warned party members that France's future would be in danger if the Popular Front were not maintained. After this morning's opening ceremony, the congress continued at 2:30 PM. The delegates sang the Marseillaise, and leftist representatives raised their fists in the Popular Front salute, while right-wing representatives gave the fascist salute, leading to disputes. Dala then urged the delegates to maintain order and delivered a speech, saying, "Our party is a great republican party, and the issues we are discussing concern the fate of the republican system and the future of the nation. We must maintain dignity and a cool head." Dala then recounted the Radical Socialist Party's decision last year to join the Popular Front and its subsequent adherence to its promises, saying, "Our party joined the Popular Front at the behest of its members. This mandate should be confirmed or revoked by us. Also, the achievements of the Popular Front cabinet since taking power are worth supporting, and all of you are asked to decide. However, I firmly believe that you, for the current government's social reforms, although you may not unanimously support them, you must express your approval with an overwhelming majority." Dala also said that the working class has long suffered from unprecedented economic panic, and it is inevitable and excusable for them to cause disturbances in their joy over the victory of the Popular Front. As for the Popular Front, it must still be maintained, otherwise France's economy will suffer greatly. In short, the current focus of discussion is on the economic aspect, which has already transcended the scope of traditional party politics. Therefore, the urgent task is to maintain social tranquility to create an atmosphere conducive to economic recovery. Other party members subsequently delivered speeches, also advocating for the maintenance of the Popular Front and social tranquility, with similar wording. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>One Party in Belgium Attempts Violent Coup; Demonstration Scheduled for Tomorrow; Government Takes Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>Brussels – The Rexist Party, a semi-fascist royalist party, has threatened to carry out a violent coup. Prime Minister Janson mentioned this in a radio broadcast last night, saying that the government has ordered a ban on the demonstration, as the party's leader, Degrelle, has announced plans for a mass demonstration of 250,000 party members on Sunday, regardless of the authorities' prohibition. The main reason is to maintain order. The government has long tolerated the drastic movements of political parties, intending to respect the freedom of the constitution and will continue to do so in the future. However, when a party announces that it will disregard the government's decision and attempt to overthrow the legitimate government with a large-scale movement, the government will clearly tell them that this is not allowed. Belgium cannot accept a government formed from the streets. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Bruges, Belgium – After the cabinet decided to ban the Rexist Party's planned demonstration for next Sunday, the party's leader, Degrelle, issued an official statement last night, saying, "We demand that the government respect the people's freedom of expression. Although the government has ordered a ban on the rally to be held by our party on Sunday, we must still gather 50,000 party members from inside and outside the capital on that day, arriving in the capital on Saturday, Sunday morning, or both. Together with the 50,000 party members in the capital, totaling 100,000, we will cheer and pay our respects to King Leopold III when he reviews the veterans of the European War." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Rexist Party held a meeting last night, and a large crowd gathered around the meeting place to hold a counter-demonstration. The police dispersed them and arrested 50 people. In addition, well-informed sources say that the government, because the party disregarded the ban and still intends to hold a rally on Sunday, has ordered the garrison in the capital to be on alert to prevent incidents.

<h3>Britain Actively Expanding Air Force; Orders 300 Aircraft from the United States</h3>

The American factories that have received orders are the Martin and Curtiss-Wright aircraft companies, which will build twin-engine and single-engine light bombers, but the number is unknown.

<h3>Wang Ying's Bandit Troops Have Long-Term Designs on Shangdu; Wang's Troops Seize Food and Horses in Taolin; Li Shouxin Convenes Seamstresses to Rush Making Camp Tents; A Certain Party Convoys a Large Batch of Munitions to the Bandit Army</h3>
<p>Shangdu Correspondence: Wang Ying, commander of the puppet Anti-Communist Autonomous Army, has returned from the Jiabusi Temple meeting. The clamor for a western invasion has been rife, but now, for more than ten days, this claim has become smoke screen. In fact, he has never forgotten the fertile area of Hetao. Amidst this clamor for Wang's bandits to invade the west, figures behind the scenes are actively preparing. Our army is working hard to thicken the defense line, which is within everyone's expectations, and Wang Ying's bandit troops have not relaxed for a moment either. In recent days, a certain part of Wang Ying's bandit troops has been constantly engaging in skirmishes in the area south of Wulanhada in Shangdu County with the cavalry of Zhao Chengshou's unit of the Jin-Sui Defense Army (stationed in Honggertu in the second district of Taolin County). The guard posts of the bandit and our troops are no more than a bullet's distance apart. Although the bandit army often invades, it has never succeeded due to the strong forces and solid positions of our defense army, and has been repelled. Judging from the bandits' purpose, it seems to be testing the strength of the defense army. Later, due to repeated attacks and repeated defeats, they have recently been digging trenches and building ramparts day and night, which seems to be a sign of stubbornly resisting the Jin-Sui army in the east. Wang's bandits also know very well that their own forces are insufficient, so they are making plans for long-term offense and defense. This is also one of the reasons why the war in Sui East has not broken out immediately.</p>
<p>The area occupied by Wang Ying's bandit troops is conveniently located on the main transportation route between Sui, Suiyuan, and Chahar North. Therefore, his subordinates often take the opportunity to cross the border to rob horses and food from the people in Taolin, which belongs to Suiyuan. A few days ago, more than 400 horses were robbed by bandits from the horse herds in Hongqimiao, Taolin County. The Xinghe Security Team arrived in time to recover them. Wang's bandit troops often rob within Shangdu. Such robberies are more frequent at night. Wang Ying tolerates all of them without questioning. Therefore, the residents are extremely resentful.</p>
<p>The Li Shouxin's troops, which support Wang Ying's bandit army in its westward invasion, are now actively collecting food and preparing military uniforms north of Zhangbei City, and are extremely busy. Recently, Li dispatched his subordinates to collect a large number of sewing workers, who are rushing to make several camps for marching and lodging in Zhangbei City day and night. It is said that the weather is getting colder and colder, and there will be ice and snow on the way to the west. Moreover, there are many nomadic people outside the pass, and there are very few houses. Therefore, they are making plans in advance. On the 19th and 20th of this month, a certain party supplied Li Shouxin, Wang Ying and other bandit troops with a large batch of military supplies, which were transported to Zhangbei by heavy-duty vehicles from a certain place. It is estimated that 19 vehicles arrived on the evening of the 19th, including 11 cars of rifles and 8 cars of bullets. 12 heavy-duty vehicles arrived on the 20th, all of which were shells. In addition to retaining some for use in Zhangbei to supply Li Shouxin's bandit troops, the rest will be transported from Zhangbei to Shangdu within a few days to supply Wang's bandits.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Zhejiang Province Fund-Raising for Purchasing Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Memorial for Celebrating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday was organized by party and government organs and all walks of life. Huang Shaohong, Xu Shaodi, Luo Xiatian, Zheng Wenli, Hu Jianzhong, and others were elected as standing committee members, and nine regional branches were organized with each administrative inspectorate as a unit to carry out fund-raising with all their strength. After six and a half months, more than 500,000 yuan was raised, and another 100,000 yuan was raised by the Zhejiang Branch of the China Aviation Association. Six aircraft were purchased together and presented to the government. At 7:30 a.m. on the 23rd, a naming ceremony was held at the Lakeside Public Sports Ground. Huang Shaohong, Chen Qinshi, Xu Shaodi, Luo Xiatian, Hu Jianzhong, Zhou Xiangxian, and the representatives of the nine districts, Wang Xianqiang, Shen Tao, and Li Shanjun, etc., and guests, Wang Jianyang, Cheng Yuanfan, Xu Qingfu, Jiang Jianren, and public officials, students, Boy Scouts, and military police from various organs, groups, and schools in the provincial capital attended. First, Huang Shaohong, chairman, explained the significance of presenting aircraft to celebrate the birthday, and decided that Zhou Xiangxian would report on the preparation process. Chen Qinshi was then publicly elected to perform the naming ceremony and recite the naming speech. It was stipulated that Zhejiang No. 1 would be Hangzhou Special, Zhejiang No. 2 would be Shaoxing Special, Zhejiang No. 3 would be Ningbo Special, Zhejiang No. 4 would be Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Special, Zhejiang No. 5 would be Jinhua-Quzhou-Yan-Wenzhou-Taizhou-Chuzhou Special, and Zhejiang No. 6 would be the Zhejiang Branch of the Aviation Association Special. After the naming, the whole audience shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" and "Long live the Three Principles of the People". The aviation school sent a training aircraft to fly low and scatter birthday leaflets. Then, Aircraft No. 1 to No. 6 from Zhejiang were piloted by instructors from the aviation school and performed various technical performances in the sky above the venue.

<h3>Songjiang: Patrol Police Arrest Deserters</h3>
<p>The patrol police of the third police station in this city saw two men wearing military uniforms walking slowly on Xiuye Bridge at 1:00 p.m. yesterday (22nd). They stepped forward to question them, and they looked flustered. After taking them to the bureau for questioning, they confessed that one, Zhang Yuexing, 23 years old, and Zhang Qichang, 31 years old, were both from Qingzhou, Shandong, and had been soldiers in a certain army. Later, they were dismissed for some reason and fled to Songjiang. The bureau transferred them to the district security command for interrogation on the grounds that the case involved deserters.</p>
<h3>Fengjing Establishes Red Cross Branch</h3>
<p>Fengjing in the fifth district of this county is located at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Songjiang Red Cross Branch considered its important location and established an office there. The Fengjing members also requested the same establishment for the disaster relief training class this time. However, because the place is the boundary between Songjiang and Jiashan County, Zhejiang, separated by only one bridge, it is stipulated that 20 students from Jiashan will also be admitted to receive the same first aid training. The Songjiang Branch has obtained the approval from the Zhejiang Provincial Government and has ordered the Jiashan County Government to comply.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: One Killed and One Injured in Attack</h3>
<p>Tao A'er, a resident of Zhoupu Town in the fifth district, has recently been setting up a fortune-telling stall in Tanzhi Bridge Town in the seventh district. Yesterday, after a dispute with his companions over the division of accounts, he returned home. When passing through the Chuanjiazhai area, he was shot and killed. Gu Peihua, a Kunshan resident who was traveling with him, was also shot twice. The township chief, Qiao Kerren, hired a boat to send him to the Zhoupu County Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the Zhoupu First Police Station for investigation and reporting to the county bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Investigating Corrupt Township Head</h3>
<p>Lin Peihua, the township head of Huanhu Township in the eighth district of this county, extorted fishermen under the pretext of collecting registration fees for crab-breaking certificates and embezzled a large amount of public funds from the Bacheng Thirteenth Village Credit Cooperative. After the county government sent personnel to investigate and verify, it ordered his dismissal and strict punishment on the 23rd. The vacancy was ordered by District Chief Lu Jiazhen to select another person to be commissioned.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Prevent Rice Stem Borer Infestation</h3>
<p>The county's rice crops suffer huge losses from rice stem borer infestation every year, and last year was the worst. County Magistrate Peng Baichuan has listed rice stem borer control as one of the central tasks of the county's administration in order to thoroughly prevent it, and has used the baojia system to force farmers to jointly control it. The rice stem borer control measures for this winter have also been drafted in preparation for implementation. Starting on the 26th, each district will hold expanded rice stem borer control propaganda.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Prolonged Drought Causes Vegetable Prices to Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, vegetable prices here have soared. Greens cost 200 cash per catty, and turnips cost about 100 cash per catty. Compared to normal times, this is a sudden increase of three times, causing hardship for the poor. The main reason is the prolonged lack of rain, making it difficult for vegetables to grow. In addition, small insects are swarming and damaging crops, leading to this situation. This area has been suffering from drought for a long time. Since a rain shower on September 15th, there has been no rain for 38 days. As a result, not only is the late rice crop suffering, but it is also affecting the spring harvest next year. Because when the soil cracks, wheat, rapeseed, soybeans, broad beans, etc., cannot be sown. Therefore, farmers are eagerly hoping for rain. Furthermore, other aspects, such as the prevalence of seasonal diseases due to dry weather, are also unfavorable in all areas. Therefore, people urgently hope for early rain.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: Careless Fire at Plank Shop and Warehouse</h3>
<p>At the Juta Plank Shop warehouse behind the Xie Shang Garden in the north gate of this city, a fire suddenly broke out due to carelessness at 1:00 PM on the 21st. The flames were uncontrollable. After the fire brigades from various sections rushed to the rescue, the fire was finally extinguished. In this incident, all the houses were completely destroyed, burning more than ten coffins, as well as nine large and small coffins deposited by the Zhang family. All were completely burned.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Chen Tiaoyuan Comes to Wuxi to Present Flags</h3>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan, President of the Nanjing Military Council, arrived in Wuxi by special train from Shan County, Zhejiang, on the 22nd and 23rd. It is scheduled for 9:00 AM today (the 24th) at the public sports field outside the West Gate to hold a flag presentation ceremony for the officers of the garrison. The ceremony will be grand and simple. It is reported that Chen may go to Jiangyin for a trip and then take a special train to the Jinpu Railway garrison to present flags.</p>
<h3>West Gate Shops Go on Strike</h3>
<p>The Yan Yun Ji Fresh Fish Shop on Pengxia Street outside the West Gate of this county was opened with investment from Yan Yunqiao and business was good. At 3:30 PM on the 23rd, Yin A'da, a cook from the Yinglong Bridge Police Station of the 4th Public Security Bureau, bought one yuan worth of crabs from the fish shop, stating that it should be two and a half catties. The employee Qin A'ting tied the crabs with a rope and weighed them with a market scale, warning the cook to use a grain scale, otherwise he would return the crabs. The shop refused. Another employee, Chen A'san, then spoke rudely, leading to a dispute. Later, Xu Dequan, the shop's accountant, stepped in to mediate, but without result. The cook then returned to the station and reported that one yuan of legal tender had been robbed. Upon receiving the report, Police Chief Yang Huaxi led the police to the shop and took the shop's accountant, Ji Dequan, employees Chen A'san and Qin A'ting, and a passerby, Shen A'ting, and others, totaling four people, to the station for temporary detention. The shops in the area, seeing this situation, all felt indignant, believing that the police station was making trouble unreasonably and disrupting the market, which aroused public anger. Around 5:00 PM, all the shops from Xianying Bridge to Yinglong Bridge went on strike, and the situation became serious. The shops decided to jointly petition the Special Commissioner's Office and the County Government to remove Police Chief Yang and the cook, and request relief to pacify the business community.</p>
<h3>Planning for Suzhou-Wuxi Road Automobile Service</h3>
<p>Since the Suzhou-Wuxi Road was actively opened, it has been fully completed. The road connects Suzhou and Wuxi counties and passes through bustling towns and scenic areas. It is indeed necessary to have an automobile service. Now, Fang Shengru and others, together with Suzhou gentry Li Genyuan and Liu Zhengkang, have launched the Suzhou-Wuxi Road Long-Distance Automobile Company. It has been submitted to the Construction Department for approval and record, and it has been granted exclusive operation rights. It is currently actively surveying the entire route, arranging station locations, and has established a preparatory office at the Qitai Zhan to discuss shareholding matters.</p>
<h3>Dried Bamboo Shoots and Melon Seeds Soar in Price</h3>
<p>Recently, goods such as gauze, silk cocoons, rice, wheat, and flour in the county have suddenly soared in price, and people's living standards have increased, causing panic. Yesterday, the sundries industry also saw soaring prices for its goods. For example, the opening price of new dried bamboo shoots was 26.5 yuan, and this month it has risen to 36 yuan per dan. The reason is that Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other provinces are actively purchasing. Melon seeds, such as large seeds, previously sold for 13-14 yuan per dan, but now they have risen to about 21 yuan per dan. Medium seeds previously sold for 10 yuan, and now sell for 17 yuan. These goods are not available on the market because they are being hoarded by various mountain goods merchants. Wuxi has more than 7,000 packages in stock. However, the market price of longan has fallen sharply. High-quality goods previously sold for more than 120 yuan per dan, but now they have fallen by more than 50 yuan, selling for only 74-75 yuan per dan. This is because the harvest in Fujian and the producing areas is good, but the output is not smooth. Hunan lotus seeds, Shanghai Risin brand, previously sold for 48 yuan per dan and now sell for 43-44 yuan, and the market is fair. In addition, the new goods of red dates are looking high at 21 yuan per dan, medium goods at 16-17 yuan, and lower goods at 12-13 yuan. The price is expected to fall based on the current situation, because most people eat old goods. However, each sundries store has very few old goods, black dates are 17-18 yuan, and lower goods are 12-13 yuan, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi (9)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Xiao An</p>
<p>From Guangzhou to Nanning</p>
<p>After the Guangxi authorities cooperated with the central government, the Guangxi situation is even more of concern to the people of the country. The reporter took advantage of being in Guangdong and made a trip to the Yong River. Historically, the journey from Guangzhou to Yong involves first taking a connecting boat from the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway across the river to Shiwetang. Then, from Shiwetang, take the Guangzhou-Sanshui branch line of the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Sanshui River Mouth. From Sanshui River Mouth, transfer to a Hong Kong-Wuzhou transport ship to Wuzhou. This takes at least two days. From Wuzhou to Yong, both land and water routes are available. For the land route, first cross the river from Wuzhou to Rongxu, and then take a car. If you hire a car, you can arrive from morning to evening, taking only one day. For the water route, take a boat up the West River at around 11:00 PM. All the cities and towns along the way must be stopped at, and it takes three days to arrive. Because the river flow is rapid and very winding, and the boats traveling between Yong and Wuzhou are electric boats, it is not easy to travel quickly. The reporter was limited by time, and it was uneconomical to follow the above journey to Yong, so he decided to take a Southwest Aviation Company plane. The company's planes are well managed and have never been heard to have any accidents since they started flying, so their performance has been praised by the people of Guangdong and Guangxi and they deeply believe in the safety of their flights.</p>
<p>Southwest Aviation Company has two routes: the Guanglong Line and the Guangqiongnan Line. The Guanglong Line goes from Guangzhou via Wuzhou, Guixian, and Nanning to Longzhou, and connects with Hanoi in Vietnam. Flights depart from Guangzhou to the west on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and from Longzhou to the east on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Ticket prices are calculated in silver dollars. From Guangzhou to Wuzhou, a one-way ticket is 30 yuan and a round-trip ticket is 55 yuan. To Nanning, a one-way ticket is 85 yuan and a round-trip ticket is 150 yuan. To Longzhou, a one-way ticket is 110 yuan and a round-trip ticket is 190 yuan. Now that the capital of Guangxi Province has moved to Guilin, for the convenience of air transportation between Guangdong and Guangxi, the company has added Guilin and Liuzhou as stations under the principle of developing air routes. In the future, the flight route will go from Guangzhou to Wuzhou, then to Guilin, then from Guilin to Liuzhou, and then from Liuzhou to Nanning and Longzhou. At the same time, the company also plans to open the Nanggui Line, that is, from Nanning to Guiyang. The unification has been achieved, and there is indeed a need to work hard to build the national aviation industry, and it is also because the company's performance is excellent that it has this development. The Guangqiongnan Line goes from Guangzhou via Maoming, Qiongzhou, and Beihai to Nanning. Flights depart from Guangzhou to the west on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and from Nanning to the east on Wednesdays and Sundays. Ticket prices: Guangzhou to Maoming, one-way 40 yuan, round-trip 70 yuan; to Qiongzhou, one-way 60 yuan, round-trip 105 yuan; to Beihai, one-way 80 yuan, round-trip 140 yuan; to Nanning, one-way 100 yuan, round-trip 175 yuan. The round-trip time is valid for one month from the date of issue. The company currently has four planes, all of which have four seats, but because the company is determined to develop air routes, it deeply feels that four planes are not enough. Therefore, it has purchased two more seven-seat planes from the United States. They can arrive in Guangdong in about two months, and it is planned to allocate one to the Guanglong Line and one to the Nanggui Line. It is said that the company has achieved such good results thanks to the planning of Liu Peiquan, the company's managing director. Liu has been engaged in the aviation industry for 20 years and has never slackened. Liu is the most related person in the history of Chinese aviation. Liu has rich experience, so the Southwest Aviation Company he presides over is thriving.</p>
<p>The reporter took the Guanglong Line plane west on Monday. The airport is in Shipai in the east of Guangzhou. The airport is close to the Shanghai-Guangdong line airport of the China Aviation Company. Because the Guangdong situation had not changed long ago, there were troops protecting it. The reporter arrived at the airport before 8:00 AM. Soon, an adjutant from the Fourth Route Army headquarters came to inquire about his hometown, age, occupation, and mission to Nanning. All were recorded in the register. After that, the luggage was checked. It seemed that it was necessary to clarify the origins of those going to Guilin. At 8:15, he boarded the Qiming plane. At that time, an employee of the airline told the reporter that the Beidou plane would also fly to Yong at the same time. Those taking the Beidou were chartering the plane. The Qiming had only one passenger, which was no different from chartering a plane. Let's see who flies faster in the sky. After speaking, they smiled at each other and shook hands to say goodbye. Then, the Qiming took off. The Beidou followed immediately. The time was 8:20. The two planes flew west. When passing over Guangzhou, looking down at the outline of the whole city, it felt very small. Even Yuexiu Mountain in the north of the city did not appear to be very raised. In an instant, it had crossed Shiwetang Foshan, and the villages, fields, wilderness, and trees in the distance were all very beautiful like a garden. However, the color of the paddy fields, some red, some white, and some green, was also a spectacle. Passing Sanshui to Zhaoqing, the various embankments along the West River were very large projects. From Zhaoqing to the southwest, there were gradually more peaks and ridges. Entering the Cangwu territory of Guangxi, the majestic mountains were heavily stacked, and the lush forests and bamboos were dense, forming the appearance of provincial defense. The Qiming passed Wuzhou and did not descend. Because Wuzhou had no passengers and the airport was still flooded, it went straight to Teng County Guiping. Along the way, the towering mountains and ridges continued. The highways mostly passed through the mountainsides, because their horizontal lines were in the mountains and not in the fields. Continuing to the Guixian territory, the fields seen were almost all in the mountains, in terraces, which was quite beautiful. Farmers also built gates to store water between the streams for irrigation of the fields. Looking from above, the reservoirs and streams were as bright as mirrors. This shows that the people of Gui are diligent in production and are unwilling to abandon barren mountains. Passing Guixian and then Yongchun, it is the Yongning County territory. The airline's airport is in the northeast of Yongyuan, so before the plane landed, it was a pity that it could not overlook the face of the entire city. After the Qiming arrived at the airport, the Beidou also arrived. The time was 11:15. The entire journey took less than three hours, which saved a lot of time compared to land and water travel. The reporter then went to Beidou and asked the passengers. According to the answer, it was Mr. Gao from the Guangxi Provincial Bank, because he had more luggage, so he chartered a plane. At that time, the airline came by car, and the reporter took a ride to Jincheng and stayed at the Lequn Club on Gonghe Road.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Discarded Noodles Thrown Away for Testing</h3>
<p>The Zhencheng Highway in Jiangsu Province had a private car coming from Jiangyin the other day, throwing noodles along the way in places like West Xiaohu, speeding past. The pie was filled with small fish, fish intestines, and oil. The staff at Xiaohu Station picked up one. The station staff deemed the scattering of the noodle pies quite bizarre, suspecting it was the work of villains, and especially sent the pie to the Wujin Station for transmission to the Public Security First Resident Station. Inspector Zhou Daonan also thought the pie was quite noteworthy, to avoid affecting public security, especially prepared a document to send the pie to the County Public Security Bureau, for convenience of testing to see if it had any toxic substances.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Repairing River Embankments Along the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The river embankments of Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Liuhe, Jurong, Jiangning, Jiangpu, and other seven counties along the Yangtze River in this province are about 200 kilometers long, and are greatly related to the safety of the future of water conservancy in the north and south of the Yangtze River. A month ago, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Project Office sent staff to various counties for on-site inspection in order to guide the seven counties along the river in flood prevention. According to the situation, it is necessary to actively coordinate the river embankments. It has now been decided to implement the plan. The first step is to start with surveying and organize a river embankment surveying team in the seven counties along the Yangtze River. The principles of repair have been approved. The organization of the surveying team is ready, and Xu Di'e has been appointed as the team leader. Work will begin at the beginning of next month and should be completed in three months. As for the new repair methods and the estimation of construction costs, they can only be determined after the surveying is completed. The strength of the newly repaired embankment will be based entirely on the standards of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission's embankments.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Cracking a Robbery of Flower Funds Case</h3>
<p>In the Jiujiaba area, three bandits robbed the Yusheng Flower Shop of 15,000 yuan in flower funds being transported to Sanyu Town. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a detective team leader, Yao Dangping, to lead the police to pursue and arrest them. At 4:00 AM on the 22nd, the bandit Ji Youen was arrested in Zhigang Township, and 2,680 yuan of stolen money was seized. In the afternoon, another suspect, Ji Rongfang, was apprehended, along with a portion of the stolen money. Another suspect, Ji Yourui, was also apprehended and sent to the County Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Searching for Opium Addicts in Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The County Government temporarily mobilized police teams on the night of the 21st to conduct a large-scale search for opium addicts in urban and rural areas. A total of more than 80 male and female offenders were arrested. After interrogation overnight by Commissioners Pan and Zhang, they were sent to the drug rehabilitation center for examination.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Grain Storage</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Bishop Hui's Letter to Believers, Praying for President Chiang</h3>
<p>On the 29th of this month, it is the 50th birthday of President Chiang of the Executive Yuan. Bishop Hilaire Jasone of the Shanghai Catholic Diocese has specifically designated Sundays around his birthday as days of prayer for China. We hereby publish the notice to priests under his jurisdiction as follows: As we approach the auspicious occasion of President Chiang's fiftieth birthday, this Bishop earnestly requests all priests to instruct their believers to pray to the Lord for the Republic of China and its leaders on the Feast of Christ the King (October 25th) or the Feast of All Saints (November 1st). The prayer format can follow the program of prayers for religious holidays. Indeed, Jesus Christ not only wishes priests to guide believers toward heaven, but also hopes that they instruct believers on how to love and serve the country. He himself showed people the principles of patriotism. Our Catholic Church has always held a respectful view of the country and has never taught believers to sever ties with the country, but teaches them with sacred doctrines and sacraments, so that they are rich in patriotism, enhance the vigorous vitality of the people, and radiate the idea of ​​brotherly love, helping each other, bonding with each other, and making it their duty to serve the country with utmost loyalty and enthusiasm for public welfare. We Catholics deeply know that the Kingdom of Heaven is not in this world, so we oppose the materialism of the communists, but we never despise the rights and interests of the country, disregard the lifeline of the country, but rather, in accordance with God's wisdom, strive to seek the happiness and progress of the country. Therefore, we will pray to God for the leaders of China next Sunday, and especially for Chairman Chiang, so that they can understand where their responsibilities lie and fulfill them well, and that in this critical situation, they can take appropriate measures to obtain the true benefits that the country deserves, that is, internal national economy and people's livelihood, and gradually stabilize, and the international status will increase day by day. The New Life Movement is now popular throughout the country, and we should also ask the Lord to bestow upon the Chinese compatriots to return to Christ, for Christ is our way, truth, and life. And we pray that they will recognize the truth of the Catholic Church and provide all kinds of assistance, so that it can reach its sole purpose as soon as possible, which is to spread the divine kingdom of God. October 21, 1936, Hui, Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese.</p>

During the banquet, the Secretary-General of the association, Lu Ganchen, gave a welcome speech. Ambassador Chiang gave a speech, which was a great success. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Ganchen's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's welcome speech briefly stated that Mr. Chiang is knowledgeable and has a high reputation. Today's appointment as ambassador is indeed expected. This time he takes office to promote friendly relations between the two countries and shoulders a great mission. He respectfully wishes him unlimited progress and thanks all the guests for their presence. With sincere sincerity, please raise a glass of light wine to pray for Ambassador Chiang, a smooth journey, and good health, and deeply hopes that he will work hard to promote friendly relations between the two countries. Then he invited Ambassador Chiang to give a speech.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: (1) Regarding the relationship between Russia and China, historically, the two countries have always been friendly. Geographically, the borders are connected. Both countries are vast and rich in resources, and their situations are quite similar to ours. Both can be self-sufficient without asking others, and do not harbor aggressive ambitions. They are willing to maintain world peace. In recent years, Russia's construction industry has progressed rapidly, and our country has also made considerable progress in national construction in recent years. I hope to work harder and move forward. (2) International friendship, the interaction between countries is like the interaction between people. For example, some people like to smoke cigars, but I don't. However, I will not refuse to be friends with him because he likes to smoke cigars. Also, some people regard horse riding as a pleasure, but I regard it as ordinary, because I don't like horse riding, but I will not refuse to associate with him because I don't like horse riding. People's friendship is like this, and international relations are also like this. Although the economic and political systems of the two countries are different due to national conditions, the two countries can also be friends with each other, and international friendship will increase day by day. (3) International relations should be based on mutual respect. International relations should be treated equally, without being biased towards this and not being thin to that, so that the relationship between countries can improve day by day and can reach the path of mutual respect, understanding, and mutual understanding. Finally, he said, I am very grateful for your presence and participation, and I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic hospitality and banquet provided by Secretary-General Lu and the directors of the YMCA. I am really uneasy and express my deepest gratitude. The speech was met with thunderous applause, toasts were exchanged, and the photography was dispersed.</p>

<h3>Order from the Ministry of Industry: Register Domestic Goods Factories to Create a List of Domestic Goods for Reference in Purchasing Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Movement Federation has received Notice No. 1746 of the Ministry of Industry, stating that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Federation to submit a request to the government to reaffirm the government's previous order to purchase domestic goods by government agencies. For cases where foreign goods are still purchased despite the availability of domestic substitutes, reimbursement should not be approved. The Ministry has been ordered to quickly formulate practical measures to ensure rapid implementation. After investigation, the common items used by various agencies, including various stationery, equipment, and other supplies, are numerous in variety. When various agencies purchase them on the market, it is often difficult to distinguish between domestic and foreign goods, or they do not know whether domestic goods are available for these items. This is an important reason for the ineffective promotion of purchasing domestic goods. To promote implementation, a list of domestic goods should be created for common items used by various agencies and distributed to various agencies to facilitate selection and purchase. To ensure complete recording of the products of domestic goods factories nationwide, in addition to the domestic goods items that have been issued with domestic goods certificates, factory registration, and approved for rewards by the Ministry, the Ministry has created a list of domestic goods and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review, which will be forwarded to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. There are still many domestic goods items that have not been legally registered with the Ministry. The Federation is requested to conduct a thorough investigation and instruct the domestic goods factories to legally register with the Ministry or issue domestic goods certificates so that a list of domestic goods can be created and distributed to various agencies for adoption in succession. This is extremely important, and this is hereby notified.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's River Vessels Successfully Reformed, Equipment Clean and Passengers Comfortable</h3>
<p>Since the reform of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the repair of ships, the addition of equipment, and the improvement of cabins have all been aimed at passenger safety and comfort. By the end of June this year, the statistics of passenger income increased by more than 438,000 yuan compared with the previous year. Now, Chen Xiaozeng, the director of the Ship Department, in order to seek further improvement, will thoroughly reform the equipment of the Yangtze River ships again. The ones that have been successfully implemented are: (1) The toilet in the special-class room has insufficient flushing pressure and is not easy to clean due to the small capacity of the water tank and the improper layout of the pipes. It has been completely renovated. The toilets and bathrooms in the first-class cabin are not enough for use. Now it has been decided to convert one of the two open rooms in each ship into male and female bathrooms. The remaining space in the middle corridor will be used as a luggage storage room and fitted with folding doors. The original toilet is enlarged and used exclusively for female passengers, and the bathroom and toilet outside the right side are completely converted into male toilets. A vacant lot will be carved out behind the living room and new rooms will be added to make up for the original shortage. In the second-floor cabin, two second-class rooms have been vacated for three feet each in the offices of the purser and the tally clerk to install four conveniences for use by male and female passengers. The original lamp room has been converted into a beverage and washing room. The rear end of the third-floor cabin has been converted into a toilet, combined with the original one, which can be used separately by men and women. (2) The third-class cabin service personnel used to have no fixed berths and lived in various places. Now, 20 new three-tiered beds have been installed at the rear end, with stepping boards added to the sides of the beds and 12 new wooden cabinets with 48 drawers. Each service personnel is in charge of one to store passengers' other items. A layer of seven-foot-high square-eyed wire mesh is newly installed along the right end to be careful. The tarpaulin that encloses the wind and rain also has transparent soft film windows to make the light bright. The kitchen utensils and chopping tables used to be placed in the pedestrian aisle, which obstructed traffic and cleanliness. Now, a large room in front of the kitchen (where the kitchen servants' other items used to be stacked) has been converted into kitchen utensils, and an iron shed has been installed in the south passageway to place and hang vegetables. The sailors' kitchen originally had a separate room, but now all the food is supplied by the main kitchen. This room has been used as a hot water supply room for the entire ship. The third-class cabin originally had no luggage room. Now, part of the crew's storage room on the upper floor has been carved out to store third-class passengers' luggage, but it does not hinder the opening and closing of the water tank at the stern. The third-class passengers' beds were originally two-tiered beds. Passengers on the upper tier would borrow tea servants' boxes and cabinets as stepping feet up and down. Now, all the boxes and cabinets have been removed and stepping boards have been installed between the two beds to facilitate passengers getting on and off.

Any suggestions or areas that he believes need improvement will be reported in advance for approval before being implemented. Therefore, he has no specific opinions on the work, only a desire to carefully study how to work hard. Regarding matters such as protecting overseas Chinese, promoting domestic goods, and promoting trade, many public and private organizations both domestically and abroad are studying these issues. There are also many Party and national leaders, people familiar with the situation in Australia, and returned overseas Chinese who are serving in various sectors.

Furthermore, Sino-Australian trade has recently shown signs of improvement. If all parties can promote it and work together, it will not be difficult to achieve our goals. Recently, the staff of our country's Party headquarters in Australia are all loyal comrades who have made great achievements in promoting Party affairs and promoting overseas Chinese education. After taking office, he believes that he will be able to obtain their guidance, follow the principles of the Party and the nation, and do something together for the overseas Chinese.

<h3>Xinli Woolen Mill: Criminal Lawsuit Filed Between Shareholders; Huang Pinliang Sues Lin Mengfei, et al.; Defendants Claim Goods Were Used to Offset Debt</h3>
<p>Huang Pinliang (Huang Ruiming), a Ningbo native who is a shareholder and manager of the currently closed Xinli Woolen Mill, hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a self-accusation in the First Special District District Court against Lin Mengfei, a shareholder of the mill and former vice president of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, and Sun Baowen, a shareholder and deputy manager of the mill, and Sun Baoshou, the accountant, for embezzlement and breach of trust. The court has summoned them for trial. Because the defendants have not surrendered, the order was postponed, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court and summoned both parties for questioning. According to Huang Pinliang, he and Baowen each recognized four shares, each share worth 1,000 taels of silver, and Lin recognized one share. Lin served as the supervisor, he served as the manager, and Baowen served as the deputy manager, and Baoshou was hired as the accountant. At the end of last year, he suffered from eye disease and could not go to the factory to handle matters. The defendants secretly moved and hid the goods and raw materials stored in the factory, worth more than 5,600 yuan, in the shop set up by Lin in the Rising Sun Lane on the Great Road, causing Xinli to be unable to operate and to shut down on January 18. In addition, when checking the account deposits, as of January 25, there should have been more than 760 yuan in deposits, but Baoshou only wrote that there were more than 160 yuan, a shortage of 600 yuan, and even this more than 160 yuan has disappeared. When questioned, Lin Mengfei stated that he was the manager of the Taihan Qianzhuang in Ningbo, and Xinli owed the Qianzhuang 8,000 yuan. After the Qianzhuang was liquidated last autumn, they repeatedly demanded payment but were ignored. Therefore, at the end of the year, he came to Shanghai to demand payment in person. The factory had no cash, so it used the stored goods as collateral. After selling the goods and paying off the debt, there was still more than 4,700 yuan owed. Lawyer Yuan Hanyun was hired to present the Taihan's lawsuit filed in the Civil Court this autumn against Xinli for failing to repay the debt, proving that the plaintiff's accusation of embezzlement and breach of trust actually contained a confrontational effect. According to Sun Baowen, using the goods as collateral for the debt owed to Taihan was ordered by the plaintiff to him and Lin to negotiate, and when the goods were transported to Lin's shop, the plaintiff was also present at the factory. Furthermore, the receipt issued by Lin for receiving the goods was given to the plaintiff for safekeeping, so how could he pretend not to know? Sun Baoshou stated that he returned to Ningbo on January 17 due to business matters. All the money in the account was handed over to the plaintiff, so the account from January 17 to January 25 should have been managed by someone appointed by the plaintiff. If there were any errors, he would not be responsible and it could be easily clarified by checking the handwriting. Lawyers He Xianzhang and others were also hired to defend. The court then ordered that the trial be postponed. The defendants Sun Shiwen and Sun Baoshou were released on bail by their defense lawyers He Xianzhang and Feng Meixue, and they were ordered to appear at any time.</p>

The Hong Kou police department then prosecuted him in the First Special District Court for the crime of destroying evidence under Article 165 of the Criminal Code. The court, under Judge Zhong Qing, repeatedly held court sessions to investigate the situation, as already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong continued the hearing in the criminal division. Zhang Ronghe's father, Zhang Wenshan (age 60), and lawyers Yu Hua and Jin Zhi came to court to defend him, while Prosecutor Tang Peiyou also attended to perform his duties. First, the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that during the adjournment, there had been no new developments in the case. The court then questioned Zhang Ronghe. According to Zhang, after hearing the gunshot, he suspected that his fellow villager, Zhang Tai, had been shot, so he rushed to investigate. On his way to the scene, he kicked a pistol, picked it up, and hid it in the sand box, intending to report it to the police later. The court questioned him whether he intended to sell the gun, seek a reward, or conceal evidence for the perpetrator after hiding the gun. He replied that he intended to report the matter to the police, and whether he would receive a reward was up to the police department, and he did not conceal evidence for someone else. Judge Zhong, believing that the facts of the case were clear, ordered the commencement of the debate. The police lawyer Zhang then argued that the gun seized in this case had been proven to be the weapon used to shoot Tagako and others, and the defendant had confessed to hiding the pistol both to the police and in court, and it had been confirmed by witnesses such as Japanese national Horie Tadashi. Therefore, there was no doubt about the defendant's criminal behavior, and his awareness that the gun was a murder weapon and his act of concealing it clearly demonstrated his criminal intent. As for the reason for his crime, whether it was to seek a reward or to sell the gun, it did not affect the establishment of the crime itself and should only be used by the court as a reference when sentencing. He requested that the court sentence him according to Article 165 of the Criminal Code. Judge Zhong then asked Zhang Ronghe how long it took him to reach the scene after hearing the gunshot. He replied that it took him about half a cigarette's time. The lawyer then defended Zhang, stating that according to Article 165 of the Criminal Code, a necessary condition was the existence of an act of destruction. Zhang, as a porridge vendor, was unlikely to have much knowledge. Furthermore, according to the defendant's testimony, he hid the gun to seek a reward and had no intention of destroying evidence. Moreover, the article stated that the evidence must be of a criminal defendant, but at that time, the case had just occurred, and the police had not yet begun investigating, so there was no defendant. Therefore, the article was not applicable to the defendant's actions, and he could not be found guilty. He requested that the court declare him innocent. Furthermore, the defendant's family relied entirely on him for their livelihood, and he had been detained for a long time. Even if the court found him guilty, he requested that the court be lenient due to his ignorance. Prosecutor Tang requested that the law be applied. Judge Zhong then declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for 2 p.m. on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Jiu Fu He Ji Construction Company Sues for Fraudulent Acquisition of Funds in Collusion with Foreigners - No Guandong Company Sugar Factory Exists - Credit Deposit of 3,000 Yuan Paid</h3>
<p>Wang Dun'gen, a literary figure originally from Songjiang, formerly residing at No. 1, Beidaihe Road, was recently sued in a criminal case by Zhang Qingfu, the manager of the Jiu Fu He Ji Construction Company at No. 244 Tianjin Road, represented by lawyer Ling Qihong, to the First Special District Court for colluding with foreigners to defraud him of property, along with incidental civil claims. The complaint stated that the plaintiff was introduced to the defendant Wang Dun'gen by Liu Peilin. The defendant falsely claimed that a Japanese man, Amano Hachiro, had raised capital of 6 million yuan and was jointly operating the Guandong Company Sugar Factory with the Ministry of Finance of the National Government. He had been appointed as the Chinese manager and had designated the former National Sugar Factory building at No. 783 Taixing Road, Wusong, as the factory base. He commissioned the plaintiff to contract the renovation and repair work. The plaintiff, believing that the defendant was a reputable literary figure in Shanghai with high character, did not suspect him of any wrongdoing. On October 21st of last year, a contract was signed at the Nanjing Hotel with the Japanese Amano Hachiro, with lawyer Ling Qihong as a witness. The contract stated that construction would begin within three months and be completed within six months. The total cost was 236,500 yuan, to be paid in six installments. After the start of construction, 60,000 yuan would be paid within one week. The second, third, fourth, and fifth installments would each be 35,000 yuan, and the sixth installment would be 36,500 yuan. Article 10 of the contract stipulated that the plaintiff would first pay a credit deposit of 3,000 yuan, which would be returned upon completion. At that time, the plaintiff paid 3,000 yuan in cash to the defendant and Amano Hachiro at the Guandong Sugar Factory preparation office in the Tongsheng Foreign Firm building on Guangdong Road. However, it was later discovered that the so-called Guandong Company Sugar Factory was completely false, and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government had no joint venture with Amano Hachiro, nor did it intend to appoint Wang Dun'gen as the Chinese manager of the sugar factory. The defendant colluded with Amano Hachiro, using deceptive means to mislead the plaintiff into making the payment, which constitutes the crime of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff also filed an incidental civil claim, requesting the court to order the return of the credit deposit of 3,000 yuan and the statutory interest until the date of execution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the second criminal division and summoned the defendant Wang Dun'gen to his residence at No. 1, Beidaihe Road, but the summons could not be delivered because he had moved. The plaintiff Zhang Qingfu then came to the court to provide information about the case. His lawyer, Ling Qihong, stated that there was no Guandong Sugar Factory at all. The former National Sugar Factory was founded by Ma Yushan and others, but due to poor business and the Shanghai War, the building was almost destroyed by artillery fire. It was then mortgaged to the Japanese firm Fu He Yu Foreign Firm, owned by Ma Pingsan. Anyone wishing to visit could obtain a visitor's pass from the foreign firm. The defendant took advantage of this opportunity and visited the factory, paying the gatekeeper five yuan in legal tender, saying that if he brought friends in the future, he would ask them to be treated well. A few days later, the defendant accompanied the plaintiff to the factory. At that time, the defendant instructed the plaintiff on how to renovate and repair the factory, as if he were the owner. The plaintiff, unaware of the deception, was defrauded. Judge Dai, noting that the defendant had not arrived, ordered the postponement of the hearing to the afternoon of November 6th and issued a supplementary summons for the defendant Wang Dun'gen to appear in court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Stolen from British Warship - Suspect and Stolen Goods Recovered - Remaining Stolen Goods Worth Over 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Six thousand four hundred yuan in cash and foreign currency was recently stolen from the British warship Campbeltown, which was docked in the Huangpu River. Because foreigners are not allowed on board, the incident was quite bizarre. It was later discovered that a Chinese servant on the ship named Lin was missing and was suspected of involvement. The incident was reported to the maritime and land authorities for assistance in apprehending him. This news was reported in the local *Shanghai Times*. It has now been learned that the Customs Water Police, after investigating, learned that Lin had taken a plane to Fujian. They immediately telegraphed the authorities there to arrest him. A telegram has been received in Shanghai stating that the person has been apprehended and over 3,000 yuan of the original stolen goods have been recovered. The ship has now left Shanghai. It is understood that, apart from recovering the stolen money, the ship will not pursue the matter with the servant.</p>

<h3>Lao Zha Police Station Chinese Detectives Capture Three Thieves - One Robber Fights Like a Cornered Beast - Four People Fall to the Ground, Unable to Resist</h3>
<p>Yu A'gen, the chief Chinese detective of the Lao Zha Police Station, and detective Li Shugui learned that several major thieves, carrying weapons, were gathering at the entrance of Dingxiangli, O'Reilly Road, in the French Concession around 8 p.m. the day before yesterday, plotting wrongdoing. They led Chinese detectives Weng Hongxun and Bao Tan Chen Shanj, along with French police detectives, to lie in ambush there. At 8:30 p.m., the bandits Chen Ruiting and Wu Jinyuan from Anhui Province arrived and were arrested. They learned that another thief, armed with two pistols, was lying in wait in Dingxiangli Alley. Detective Li sneaked into the alley and saw Zhang Jinchun from Anhui, holding a pistol, standing in the alley. Detective Li immediately grabbed Zhang around the waist from behind, attempting to take his gun. Zhang resisted strongly, leading to a fierce struggle. Detectives Weng and Chen also came to help. Zhang fought like a cornered beast, but eventually all four fell to the ground. Zhang was unable to resist and was subdued. The pistol, loaded with five bullets, was seized. A box cannon, loaded with nine bullets, was also found in Zhang's waistband. Five box cannon bullets and two pistol bullets were found in Zhang's pockets. Two accomplices escaped. The three captured criminals and weapons were taken back to the police station. It was discovered that Chen and the other two criminals were involved in the robbery of the Li Yongchang Clock Shop on Fuzhou Road, in which they opened fire on the police, causing deaths and injuries, as well as the robbery of a resident surnamed Mou in Dong'anli, Binlang Road. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the situation and requested permission to detain them for one week for further investigation. Detective Li submitted a report on the circumstances of the arrest. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the report and questioned Chen, Wu, and Zhang. He then ordered the three criminals to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing in one week.</p>
<h3>Forging Letters to Entrust Carrying of Legal Tender - Scheming to Defraud 1,200 Yuan - Taking Advantage of Gu Xilang's Reputation - Public Prosecution Requires Summoning Witnesses for Investigation</h3>
<p>Gu Xilang from Chongming, who has been working as a letter carrier at the Chongming Shipping Bureau, has a good reputation. Many Chongming merchants often entrust him to carry money and goods. Sha Cailang, a tea server at the Gongxing Fabric Shop in Qinbuli, Old Matou Road, Nanshi, and a customer named Song Ruihe conspired to find out where Gu kept his money so that they could steal it, as he often carried large sums of money. They found out that there was a Song Tianlun in Chongming County, and Song Tianlun Shen Zhuang in Shanghai, who buys and sells goods on behalf of customers. Song Ruihe forged a letter from the Chongming Song Tianlun's main store, asking Shen Zhuang to entrust Gu Xilang to carry 1,200 yuan in legal tender to Chongming to settle accounts. Song Tianlun Shen Zhuang, unaware of the forgery, immediately handed over the money. Song Ruihe, knowing that the letter had arrived and the money had been handed over, immediately ordered Sha Cailang to falsely claim that the Gongxing Fabric Shop had money to transport to Chongming, tricking Gu Xilang into going to the fabric shop. Gu, unaware of the deception, put the 1,200 yuan in a small wooden box and took it to the Gongxing Fabric Shop, placing it temporarily on the table while he contacted the accounting office. Unexpectedly, the shop had no such order. When Gu turned around, the box had disappeared. Realizing that he had been tricked, he reported the matter to the Nanshi Branch, who arrested Sha Cailang and interrogated him. Sha confessed that Song Ruihe had conceived the plan, forged a letter from Song Tianlun's main store asking to exchange for cash, sent it to Song Tianlun Shen Zhuang, and, after seeing Gu Xilang put the money in the box, colluded with two Shandong men on the night of October 8th to commit the theft. The branch, considering Song's elaborate and unprecedented scheme, and discovering that he was a major swindler with tens of thousands of yuan in assets, immediately dispatched a detective team to arrest Song and hand him over to the Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the local court for detention. Gu Xilang also hired lawyer Shi Qinghua to file a private prosecution and an incidental civil claim. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the court to hear the case. According to lawyer Shi, the civil part of the case had been settled by Song Ruihe's family, and he requested that the civil part be withdrawn, but he requested a trial for the criminal part. Judge Yu ordered that the details of the theft and the circumstances of the arrest should be investigated further by summoning witnesses and questioning the investigating detectives. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Overturned Minhang Ferry - Details of the Deceased and Survivors</h3>
<p>Around 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, the Luo A'gou ferry in Minhang Town, south of Shanghai, capsized due to strong winds. In addition to the dozen or so people rescued on the spot, more than 20 passengers were not rescued and tragically drowned. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details from the investigation are as follows: Luo A'gou, 44 years old, lived in Luo Family Pond, south of the river. He had been a boatman for years. Since the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction's Highway Administration built a ferry in Minhang Town in the fall of the year before last, business had been slow, and Luo sold his ferry and sought other employment. Recently, he rented a private boat from Jiang Chunquan (34 years old) of Jiang Family Net Ferry, north of Minhang, and partnered with Jiang to continue ferrying passengers back and forth across the Huangpu River in Minhang Town. They charged only two copper coins per person, four coins less than the ferry, so many villagers were tempted by the cheaper fare. However, there were no limits, making it easy to cause accidents. Around 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Luo and Jiang carried more than 40 passengers from the south bank of the river (opposite Minhang). As they reached the center of the river, they suddenly encountered strong winds, and the ferry turned from side to side and capsized instantly. All the passengers fell into the river. The water police patrol boat spotted them and quickly ordered a small ferry boat to rush to the rescue. They rescued 15 passengers from the water, including Wang Jiacai, Wang Changfu, Wu Youniu from Fengxian, and the boat owners Luo and Jiang. The rest drowned. Water police chief Zhang Jingqing and special agent team leader Wang Xingzhen ordered all patrol boats and hired five net boats to assist the water police in searching the Huangpu River. They recovered the bodies of Li Yishou, 51 years old, and Zhu Yunpu, 40 years old, who lived in the 2nd Bao, 8th Household of Zhugang Township, Fengxian. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Local Court sent prosecutor Lei and coroner Shen to the scene for inspection. They ordered the bodies to be handed over to Li Ruan, the wife of the deceased Li, and Zhu Lu, the wife of the deceased Zhu, for collection and burial. Yesterday, they recovered the bodies of Wang Ziqing, 56 years old, from the east of Xinqiao River; Pan A'shi, from Nandabqiao, age unknown; Li Rujin, 27 years old, and He A'tu, 10 years old, both from Zhugang Township; He Chenggen, 29 years old, and Wang Guansheng, 42 years old, both from Dingqiao Township; and Wang Wang, 20 years old, from Nandabqiao. All seven bodies, male and female, were claimed by their families for burial. Those who have not yet been recovered have been reported by their families to the 1st sub-district police station of the Fengxian County Public Security Bureau, including Chen Chunxiang, Ruan Jincai, Li Jingen, Li Zhu, Zhang Jinsong, Lu Botian, Zhu Jihai, A Kunsheng from Zhugang Township, and Ma Jinsheng and Fei Hai from Dingqiao Township. The north and south banks of the Huangpu River were filled with wails, a truly unbearable scene. The boat owners Luo A'gou and Jiang Chunquan, who caused the accident, are currently detained at the 1st District of the Water Police Station, awaiting a formal document to be sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Hongzhen Shantytown Destroyed This Morning</h3>
<p>Around 1:10 a.m. this morning, the shantytowns near Dongjia Stone Bridge in Hongzhen, which were densely packed, numbering over eighty, caught fire in one of the houses. The flames quickly spread through the roof and westward, becoming uncontrollable. In an instant, all the shantytowns were almost completely destroyed by the fire. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished at 2 a.m. The suspected arsonist, Yao Linzhu, was arrested by the police and taken to the Linping Road police station for punishment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Family Hygiene Society's Medicine Confirmed to Contain Poison - Jiang Qudan's Evil Deeds Leave Trouble for His Family - Wu Zhenkang Secretly Reports Jiang's Concubine Arrested</h3>
<p>Jiang Qudan, a local Shanghai resident, founded the Shanghai Family Hygiene Society at No. 18, Lane 434, Baike Road, and sold Deer Placenta Brandy and Guanyin Savior Ten Drops Water. After Jiang's death, he left behind several wives and concubines, who moved to No. 15, Lane 45, Qingdao Road. Wu Zhenkang, a relative of Jiang, recently secretly reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau that the two types of medicine sold by the Shanghai Family Hygiene Society contained morphine and other poisonous substances. The bureau dispatched Chen Youde, an investigator from the Fourth Division, which specializes in investigating drugs, along with Wu Zhenkang, to purchase four bottles of Deer Placenta Brandy and one bottle of Guanyin Savior Ten Drops Water from Jiang Zhang, a concubine of Jiang Qudan, at No. 15, Lane 45, Qingdao Road, for a total of eight yuan. They took the medicines back to the Public Security Bureau and requested the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to conduct a chemical examination. The results confirmed that the two types of medicine contained poisonous substances. On the 10th of this month, they went to arrest Jiang Zhang, along with detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, and seized several empty bottles. She was sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday was the date for the re-examination. The Public Security Bureau again sent investigators Liu Yu and Chen Youde from the Fourth Division to testify that the medicines were indeed purchased from Jiang Zhang. They also presented the chemical examination report from the Health Bureau, which stated that the medicines contained poisonous substances. They requested a transfer. However, police lawyer Gan Yaotang argued that the Health Bureau's report was only presented today, and the police had not had time to conduct a detailed investigation. Furthermore, the crime took place within the concession, and the case should be handled by this court. He requested that Jiang Zhang be detained for an extended period. The defense lawyer requested bail. Judge Fu Lin ordered that Jiang Zhang not be granted bail and be detained for another seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Manufacturing Center on Wangzhi Road - Three Criminals Sentenced Yesterday - Municipal Public Security Bureau Picks Up One Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>On September 22nd, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team arrested Zhu Jinchang, a seller of counterfeit currency, at the Yanhailou Teahouse in the Old North Gate. Zhu confessed that the manufacturing center was located at No. 12, Dunrenfang, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession. The Second Squad was dispatched, reported to the French police, and requested assistance. They rushed to the address and arrested the owner of the center, Chen Xinchang, printers Zhu Lixing, Xiao Weibin, Yu Kunshan, and Liu Zhongde, suspects Fan Shushan, Fan Wang, and Li Wang, a total of eight people. They seized two printing presses, 99 counterfeit one-yuan banknotes from a major bank, thousands of blank paper sheets, various inks, and seven counterfeit banknote printing molds of various sizes. They took them to the police station and sent them to the Second Special District Court for questioning and detention for investigation. It was determined that Fan Shushan, Fan Wang, and Li Wang were not involved in the crime, and they were not prosecuted. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the case to pick them up and investigate them with Zhu Jinchang. Chen, Yu, Liu, Xiao, and Zhu were prosecuted according to the law. Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly opened the court for investigation. After the official statement, the sentencing date was set, which was already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10 a.m., Judge Gan arrived at the First Criminal Division and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. After briefly questioning their names and ages, he sentenced Chen Xinchang to 13 years in prison and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights, Zhu Lixing to 9 years in prison and 9 years of deprivation of civil rights, and Xiao Weibin to 6 years in prison and 6 years of deprivation of civil rights. Yu Kunshan and Liu Zhongde were found not guilty. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel with documents to the case, requesting to transfer the defendants and requesting to transfer Zhang Kezhai (also known as Mingde) and his wife Zhang Liu, who were not released by the police for prosecution. The judge ordered that the five defendants be allowed to be taken away by the Public Security Bureau personnel first, and the police station would summon Zhang Kezhai and his wife Zhang Liu. He instructed the Public Security Bureau to come to pick them up again in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>The Death of Li Xiangying: Two Men Vie for Her Wealth, Exposing a Scandal - Lu Shande's Affair with an Elderly Woman for Money - Li Mingsong Claims Marital Status Pending Proof</h3>
<p>Li Mingsong from Hangzhou (also known as Li Hongnian, 59 years old) has been running the Laoda Fang Knife Shop at No. 276 Wuchang Road. His wife, Li Xiangying (also known as Li Suyan, 51 years old), whom he married 30 years ago, lived with him at the shop. Li Mingsong once apprenticed under Jin Qinji of the Guangdong Triad Society. A Ningbo man named Lu Shande (29 years old) was also Jin's disciple, through which he became acquainted with Li Mingsong. An affair developed, and Li Mingsong allowed Lu to live in the Laoda Fang Knife Shop, which he has been doing for over two years. On the 18th of last month, Li Xiangying became seriously ill. At the time, she told her husband, Li Mingsong, that she had a China Bank savings account with 1,000 yuan in it, kept in a box, and handed him the key. On the 7th of this month, her illness worsened, and she was expected to die. Li Mingsong discussed funeral arrangements with Lu Shande, leading to a dispute, and Lu snatched the key that Li had given Li Mingsong. On the 9th, Li Xiangying died, and the funeral arrangements were jointly handled by Li Mingsong and Lu. Over 200 yuan was spent on funeral expenses, all borrowed by Lu. On the 19th of this month, Li Mingsong learned from the China Bank that the 1,000 yuan had been withdrawn by Lu. He confronted Lu on the afternoon of the previous day, but Lu presented two documents. Since Li was illiterate, Lu read the contents of the two documents to him. They required Li to acknowledge that the Laoda Fang Knife Shop had been transferred to Lu and a newspaper advertisement to that effect. Li refused and reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station at 8:50 PM the previous night. Detective Zhang Liansheng and others arrested Lu. Lu admitted to the affair with Li Xiangying and stated that he was with the elderly woman because she had some savings. He also admitted to withdrawing the China Bank deposit, stating that he deposited 400 yuan with his master Jin Qinji, returned 290 yuan to various creditors, and used the remainder for funeral expenses. He also claimed that Li Xiangying had transferred the Laoda Fang Knife Shop to him for 500 yuan. The detectives went to Jin's residence at No. 1337 Wuchang Road and recovered the 400 yuan. Yesterday morning, they escorted Lu to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the situation. Due to the complexity of the case, further investigation was required, so he requested permission to detain Lu for one week for further interrogation. When questioned, Lu Shande claimed that the deceased, Zhang Li, was his adopted mother and had been living with him and his 15-year-old son in the Laoda Fang Knife Shop. He stated that the plaintiff, Li Mingsong, did not live there and ran another knife shop on Caishi Road and was not Zhang Li's husband. Li Mingsong claimed that he and Li Xiangying were indeed husband and wife, and he still had a 77-year-old mother-in-law alive. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the statements and ordered Lu Shande to be detained for one week, and ordered Li Mingsong to provide evidence proving that he and Li Xiangying were formally married.</p>

<h3>Mammoth Production by the Research Department of the Bank of China - Publication of the National Banking Yearbook</h3>
<p>The Economic Research Department of the Bank of China's General Administration has consistently spared no effort in economic research, and the various books it has compiled have made significant contributions to economic research. Previously, recognizing the lack of complete and systematic records and statistics on China's banking industry, it began compiling and printing the National Banking Yearbook in 1934. After its publication, it was widely praised by all sectors as the only reliable reference for studying the banking industry. Since the publication of the second edition last July, it has been engaged in the third investigation and compilation, which took nearly a year to complete. The compilation methods have also been greatly reformed to ensure accuracy, completeness, and convenience in inspection and application. According to the person in charge of the department, this is the third edition of the yearbook since its publication. After the publication of the previous two editions, experts and banking authorities at home and abroad were consulted for corrections in order to meet practical needs. Various sectors generously provided valuable suggestions, either with excessive praise or detailed guidance on the compilation direction, providing strict criticism. The department studied these opinions and incorporated them.

The Ministry of Finance has now revised them and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for record-keeping, and has notified the Municipal Government to instruct the bureau to comply. The full text of the regulations is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Revised Shanghai Municipal Brokerage Business Regulations</p>
<p>Article 1: The term "brokerage" in these regulations refers to any business that manages goods and passengers, and collects commissions for buying and selling on behalf of customers. Article 2: Anyone opening a brokerage within the city limits must comply with these regulations, register with the Finance Bureau to obtain a brokerage registration certificate, and pay the following taxes: (A) Registration Tax (paid once when obtaining the certificate) (B) Business Tax (paid annually). Article 3: Applicants for a brokerage registration certificate must specify the following items in their application and provide a guarantee from a reputable store (or pay a security deposit of 200 to 500 yuan according to their grade), and attach a brief description of the brokerage's organization and tasks. After the Finance Bureau verifies and approves the application, a certificate will be issued for operation. 1. Brand name, 2. Business address, 3. Goods brokered, 4. Tax level, 5.

Article 4: The brokerage registration certificate is issued by the Finance Bureau and filled out by the four tax collection offices in the East, South, West, and North districts. The taxes payable are collected by the competent tax collection office in accordance with the regulations. Article 5: Brokerage registration certificates are divided into long-term and short-term. New certificates must be exchanged upon expiration.

<p>Special Publication for the Presentation and Naming Ceremony of Airplanes for Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday</p>
<h3>On the Occasion of Chairman Chiang's Fiftieth Birthday</h3>
<p>Our President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, was born in the summer of the 9th month of the Dinghai year, twenty-five years before the Republic (October 29th), marking his fiftieth birthday. As the Book of Songs says, "The mountains bring forth spirits, giving birth to Fu and Shen. As with Shen, so with Fu, a shield for the four states, an announcement to the four directions." Mr. Chiang embodies both Shen and Fu in one person, and his great achievements for the country, embroidered robes, and chants of praise, extend far beyond a shield and an announcement. The three hundred poems of the Book of Songs express emotions and character, created by poets to influence their superiors, collected by the Grand Master to present to the court, to observe the customs of the people, and to examine the changes in the world. The essential principle is to hope for longevity and to create a noble person. Out of love and respect, people invariably offer small gifts, saying, "This is a robe for the duke," or "This is a fur coat for the duke," offering them in private. "Carrying on military achievements, offering boars to the public," offering them in public. "Make this spring wine, to bring long life," "Ascend to the court, raise the rhinoceros horn cup, ten thousand years of boundless life," offering gifts and then extending words of praise, with heartfelt intentions for the benefit of the people. The intimacy of friends, reciprocating with peach and plum, is indeed fitting human sentiment. But as for "showing me the way, virtuous sounds are clear," seeing the people as not frivolous, joyous guests feast, and in between, they must blow the reed pipe and beat the reed organ, carrying baskets to present, calmly and communicating, convinced in their hearts, following the law, and emulating. Therefore, the Lesser Odes say, "The noble person is to be followed and emulated." The emotions between superiors and subordinates are connected, and the harmony and joy are not something that ordinary private matters can describe in words. The Book of Songs says, "The road to Zhou is like a whetstone, its straightness like an arrow," speaking of the righteousness of the way. It also says, "The hurried travelers, always fearing they will not make it, six reins like silk, galloping and driving," speaking of the king's affairs taking precedence. It also says, "Coming from the secluded valley, connecting to the tall trees, chirping its song, seeking its friend's voice," speaking of those who seek friends can rise from obscurity to clarity, from humility to elevation. Therefore, the poem "Heaven Protects" praises, "May you have many benefits, with nothing not being plentiful, may you have abundant grain, with nothing not being appropriate." The people are simple, using food and drink daily, and the commentary says "Heaven protects, the lower reports to the upper." The respect of the lower for the upper comes from the heart, daily food and drink are all due to the virtue of the upper, and there is no wasted effort, then the foundation of blessing is established. So, how will colleagues offer their blessings to Mr. Chiang on his birthday? Asking the crowd, "Like birds reforming, like pheasants flying, clearly correct, the noble person is at peace, dwelling and living, laughing and talking," what is it? "You dukes and lords, leisure has no end, be careful in your leisure," what is the path? "Your peaceful journey, not even taking a break, your two journeys, not even greasing your chariot," how do you reach the goal? The crowd all said, "Five-cornered beams and shafts, moving rings and straps, setting up this flag, building that banner, those fluttering flags, why not waver, fluttering turtledoves, hurrying and galloping, bestowing on me a hundred strings of cowries, one morning to repay them." The crane speaks of longevity. Is it in this that they offer longevity to Mr. Chiang? Is it in this? Truly a noble person, unfolding and achieving greatly. Based on the poems, let this be the opening, initiator (initiator titles, omitted due to space limitations)</p>
<h3>Donation of Funds by Various Organs Under the Municipal Government for the Purchase of Airplanes to Celebrate Mr. Chiang's Birthday</h3>
<p>On October 31st of this year, we joyfully celebrate the fiftieth birthday of the President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. Reflecting on Mr. Chiang's timely virtue and surpassing achievements, for ten years our people have been able to live and work in peace, undisturbed by war, all thanks to his beneficence. This year coincides with his birthday, and all sectors of the city, in order to repay his special achievements and to accord with public opinion, first advocated raising funds to purchase airplanes as a birthday gift. As the highest administrative organ in Shanghai, our government should take the lead to set an example. In June, we formulated the Measures for Donating Funds by Public Servants, Military Police, and Servants of Various Organs Under the Government for the Purchase of Airplanes to Celebrate Mr. Chiang's Birthday, and issued a circular to deduct and collect donations. This is the sincere intention of all the officials, soldiers, police, and servants of the government to express their respect and love for the leader and to support the country. The original measures are listed below:</p>
<p>Public servants, military police, and servants should all deduct and donate according to the following standards, for the months of July and August of this year:</p>
<p>A. For those with a monthly original salary of 49 yuan or less, deduct 2%.</p>
<p>B. For those with a monthly original salary of 50 yuan to 99 yuan, deduct 5%.</p>
<p>C. For those with a monthly original salary of 100 yuan to 199 yuan, deduct 6%.</p>
<p>D. For those with a monthly original salary of 200 yuan to 299 yuan, deduct 7%.</p>
<p>E. For those with a monthly original salary of 300 yuan to 399 yuan, deduct 8%.</p>
<p>F. For those with a monthly original salary of 400 yuan to 499 yuan, deduct 9%.</p>
<p>G. For those with a monthly original salary of 500 yuan or more, deduct 10%.</p>
<p>Those with special office expenses must also deduct donations according to the above percentage standards.</p>
<p>In July and August, the government collected donations from all organs, which have been delivered to the Shanghai Committee for the Purchase of Airplanes to Celebrate Mr. Chiang's Birthday as scheduled. Now, on the occasion of the Shanghai presentation of the airplane naming ceremony, we record the entire process of the government's deduction of funds for the purchase of airplanes as above.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai: A Few Words Regarding This Purchase of Aircraft for Birthday Greetings</h3>
<p>The giant wheel of the times advances rapidly like flowing water. Everything relies on the omnipotence of science, reaching the pinnacle of its realm. Humanity's methods of mutual slaughter in war have evolved from two-dimensional forms to three-dimensional ones. The greatness of iron birds soaring high above, their destructive and attacking power, has long been recognized by military strategists. Therefore, all aggressive nations in the world with vaulting ambitions seek to expand their air forces as tools for invasion. Those small and weak nations that are likely to be invaded also spare no effort to substantially enrich their air forces, using them as the foundation of national defense and for necessary self-defense.</p>
<p>The simplicity of our nation's aviation equipment and the inherent weakness of our national defense are undeniable. Now, great calamity is approaching. Once it erupts, won't the lives of our 490 million people become sacrifices under the giant bombs of the ferocious imperialists' planes? Won't our ancient country with 5,000 years of history instantly become a field of rubble under the brutal bombing of the violent aggressors? The tear stains of September 18th have not yet dried, and the tragic scenes of January 28th are still vivid in our minds. If we are unwilling to lose our nation and our homes, then we must use the power of the entire nation to enrich our aviation equipment!</p>
<p>Our nation, with its 490 million people, has already deeply tasted the pain of brutal bombing by aggressors, knowing that rudimentary aviation equipment is insufficient for survival in the present world. Therefore, the China Aviation Association was established the year before last, and at the same time, a campaign to raise funds for purchasing aircraft to save the nation was launched to aid national defense. Our association's members, with patriotic enthusiasm, also organized an Aviation Salvation Fundraising Committee to fulfill the duties of citizens. The results were extremely good. People in Shanghai should remember the grand occasion when the Ningbo aircraft and various sectors held naming ceremonies at the same time.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is dedicated to the Party and the nation, his hard work and great achievements are our only leader. This year, for his 50th birthday celebration, we organized the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen in Shanghai Aircraft Purchase for Birthday Greetings Fundraising Committee, electing Yu Qiaqing, Zhu Shoumei, and Jin Tingsun as chairman and vice-chairmen, and Zhi Xiao'an, Xu Zhichan, Zhang Jiguang, Yu Zuoting, Wu Daoting, Yuan Ludeng, and Zhu Meixian as standing committee members, with Zhang Shenzhi, Niao Yaqin, and Mao Heyuan as general managers. After its establishment, a dinner meeting was held at 82 Henry Road to discuss methods. In addition to the committee members, there were more than 50 people present, including Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Yongni, Sun Hegao, Wang Boyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Qin Runqing, and Sun Hengfu. At that time, everyone believed that the Chairman's birthday was the birthday of our Republic of China, and that purchasing aircraft to strengthen national defense was indeed the only key to praying for the eternal life of our nation. It was unanimously advocated to raise 100,000 yuan, independently purchase aircraft, and present it to the government as a birthday gift for the Chairman. Over the past few months, we have received enthusiastic support from our fellow-townsmen, and the great cause has been successfully completed. Do we want to wish Chairman Chiang longevity, or China longevity? Do we want to wish longevity to Chairman Chiang alone, or to the 450 million people? We fervently hope that the world's weak and small nations will unanimously respond to the aggressors' weapons with their own weapons, and to the aggressors' air force with their own national defense air force, so that the aggressors will know to restrain themselves, and the weak and small nations can survive forever in the world.</p>
<h3>The Process of Fundraising and Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Greetings by Students in Collective Training</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government advocated the method of dedicating aircraft for birthday greetings, people from far and wide followed suit. The officers and students in our collective training are deeply enthusiastic about this grand event! Through the entire body of officers and students in the collective training headquarters, they initiated the purchase of an aircraft named "Shanghai Collective Training Students," and the method of raising funds was: starting with all the officers and students saving on food and clothing to accumulate a fund of more than 3,000 yuan, and then organizing a "Collective Training Students Aircraft Fundraising Committee" to engage in solicitation, stipulating that each collective training student would donate 10 yuan or appropriately reduce the amount based on their family's circumstances. The donation amount for officers and instructors was not limited. However, small streams are difficult to gather into a great effect, and hearts were willing but strength was lacking. Therefore, the remaining amount was turned to colleagues outside who care for military training and are enthusiastic about saving the nation to continue fundraising. It is estimated that on May 31st of this year, at the opening ceremony of the collective training headquarters, 3,099.034 yuan in legal tender was raised, and on July 7th, an arts and fundraising event was held at the Kaiming Grand Theater in Suzhou, raising 816.5 yuan in legal tender. Furthermore, students from various teams were mobilized in a rotating manner, raising 43,038.97 yuan in legal tender, for a total of 46,954.104 yuan in legal tender raised before and after. The remaining amount has been planned for fundraising by Commander Song and others in conjunction with the Aircraft Purchase Birthday Greetings Commemoration Committee. It is noted that the current collective training officers and students number only over 5,000, and they were able to raise nearly 50,000 yuan in a short period with the assistance of various sectors. This is due to the passion of patriotism and the sincerity of faith in the leader, which led to success, and the ability to inspire the enthusiasm and faith of various sectors to create this unprecedented grand event. This is due to the great achievements and virtues of our Chairman! As the grand celebration approaches, the fundraising method and the process are briefly described above to record a general overview. (Military Training Committee manuscript)</p>
<h3>The Process of Fundraising for Aviation Donations by the Hotel Industry Association</h3>
<p>— Sun Qiuping</p>
<p>(1) The Motivating Factor: Since the Shanghai War, the Chinese people have had a deep understanding of the power and cruelty of the air force. The hotel industry colleagues, after reflecting on the pain, believed that to save the country and ensure survival, it is necessary to build an air force. To build an air force, the people must assist the government and work together. At that time, Yao Songnian of Shen Tai Hotel and Zhou Songxi of Weisheng Hotel, two committee members, first suggested that the hotel industry should raise funds to purchase aircraft. The main idea of their proposal was: Currently, the people of aggressive countries are enthusiastically assisting their governments in raising funds to purchase aircraft. How can the people of invaded countries ignore their own demise? We should rise up quickly to fulfill our responsibilities as citizens. If the businesses of all hotels in the city can extract and collect a percentage, it will surely accumulate to be able to purchase warplanes. If all industries nationwide hear the news and follow suit, then the power of the hotel industry's purchase of aircraft to promote the response of all industries nationwide in saving the country and ensuring survival will be significant! Therefore, they specially requested that a general meeting be convened to make a public decision. This was the initial motivation for the hotel industry to raise funds to purchase aircraft.</p>
<p>(2) The Determined Method: After the hotel industry colleagues had the motivation to raise funds to purchase aircraft, they painstakingly planned the fundraising method. On May 18 of the second year, the Shanghai Aviation Association sent a letter to this association, supporting aviation movement and making every effort to donate. The 12th plenary meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee was immediately convened, and the Aviation Association sent Zhang Yuliang as a representative to attend. After deliberation, it was decided (A) to ask Representative Zhang to convey to the Chief Commander that the public association should be substantially supported in organizing and improving so that it can be collected, (B) to appoint committee members Yao Songnian, Zhou Songxi, Sun Qiuping, Gao Weifu, Xu Wenzhao, Xu Mengyuan, Yan Rongqing, and Zhang Yichen to visit Chief Commander Wu and negotiate progress, (C) to pass the Shanghai Hotel Industry Method for Collecting Aviation and National Salvation Donations as follows: (1) The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association has formulated this method for the purpose of assisting the Aviation Association in promoting aviation salvation funds. (2) Each hotel shall add 5% to the room rate as an aviation and national salvation donation. (3) Each hotel shall collect the aviation and national salvation donation once a month and hand it over to the China Aviation Association. (4) Each hotel shall issue a receipt to the passengers for the aviation and national salvation donation collected. (5) Each hotel shall post the method of collecting the aviation and national salvation donation in each room so that passengers are aware. (6) The collection of the aviation and national salvation donation by the hotel industry shall be limited to raising 200,000 yuan. (7) The China Aviation Association shall print joint receipt forms for collecting the hotel industry aviation donation and distribute them to each hotel. (8) The China Aviation Association may send personnel to investigate the collection situation. If there are any malpractices, they shall be punished according to law. (9) The China Aviation Association shall announce the amount of aviation and national salvation donation income from the hotel industry every month. (10) This method shall be submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(3) The Fundraising Process: (A) Beginning of Collection: After the collection method was approved by the municipal government, there was a thorough preparatory work in the middle, and the situation of hotels throughout the city was investigated, divided into five grades: special, A, B, C, and D, and after preparation, the collection began on April 15 of the third year. The Aviation Association was requested to send additional personnel to be responsible for investigation. However, at the beginning of the collection, there were many obstacles. At the beginning, there was a misunderstanding by the police, which almost caused the work to come to a standstill. (B) The Situation of Negotiations: After the hotels started collecting aviation donations, the standing bureaus of the two concessions did not understand the purpose of the collection, causing misunderstandings and preventing the collection. As a result, most hotels should have announced a stop and requested negotiations. This association immediately requested the Aviation Association to submit a protest to the municipal government. After the municipal government negotiated the result, the misunderstanding was resolved. On June 25, the Aviation Association convened representatives of major hotels at the YMCA in Baixianqiao to discuss the continuation of the rectification method. Chief Commander Ying and the Chamber of Commerce's _ wheeled, successively pointed _, and immediately decided the method of merit collection as follows:</p>
<p>1. Uniformly continue collection on July 10,</p>
<p>2. Request the municipal government to reissue an announcement for guidance,</p>
<p>3. All hotels, regardless of special A, B, C, and D, shall collect. If any hotel is unwilling to collect, it shall voluntarily pay a certain amount to show its support,</p>
<p>4. The aviation donation for special A, B, and C grades shall still be deducted by 5%, and the D grade shall be 3 yuan, also according to the original method,</p>
<p>5. Please send personnel from the China Aviation Association to investigate day by day. For hotels that do not collect, please also advise them separately. (C) Organizing a Fundraising Association: Since the decision to continue collection was made, the wait-and-see attitude of a small number of colleagues still inevitably affected it. This association organized a Fundraising Committee in September of the same year, electing hotel industry magnates to be dedicated to fundraising work. The list of fundraising committee members is as follows: Ni Xianting, Chen Wenda, Gao Weifu, Liu Qirun, Xu Mengyuan, Zhou Songxi, Yao Songnian, Yan Rongqing, Zhan Wenxi, Li Wenrui, Shen Changgeng, Xu Xinquan, Zhang Renliang, Li J眉mei, Gu J眉mei, Xu Wenzhao, Zhao Quansheng, Zou Xieqing, Zhang Qiyuan, Yao Zhaoji, Wang Changgeng, Sun Qiuping, Zhou Xiangsheng, and Ren Yueer. Chen Tianyin and other 25 people, at that time, each fundraising committee member was assigned to fundraising work, and each hotel was grateful for the public friendship and private relations, and all accepted the advice. By this point, the foundation of the hotel industry aviation donation was laid, and the official collection began. (D) Police Interference Again: In March of this year, the political department of the French Concession Police Department fined Da Hu, Asia, Dafang, Guangtailai, Ping An, Changjiang, and Taian Trading Stations for collecting aviation donations, and stopped the collection. At the same time, the police officers of major hotels in the Public Concession also collected donation books and receipts. After this association forwarded the request to the Aviation Association and the Municipal Government for negotiation, all sectors of this city supported this association. As a result, the police side also knew that the patriotic movement of our people should not be overly suppressed, so they indicated that they would no longer obstruct those who voluntarily donate. This association then advised colleagues to continue the collection. (4) Conclusion: From the above-mentioned facts, the difficulties encountered by this association in collecting the hotel industry aviation donation are: First, the colleagues failed to join the association unanimously, resulting in the preparation and implementation being more time-consuming and laborious. Second, the misunderstanding of the concession authorities caused the colleagues to hesitate and wait and see. Again, the decline of business, the mutual price reduction and competition among colleagues almost made it impossible for the colleagues to maintain their own survival. The impact on the collection of aviation donations is self-evident. In addition to devoting itself to fundraising work, this association also planned to unify discounts and stabilize room rates as indirect assistance. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chief Commander Wu Tiecheng and General Manager Gu Dachao of the Aviation Association, and the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, we have overcome difficulties and completed initial results, so that the Hotel Industry No. 1 aircraft can soar in the sky. But we will never be satisfied with the Hotel Industry aircraft, and we sincerely hope that the success of the Hotel Industry team will lead to the naming of the Hotel Industry aircraft, which can be used as a touchstone for other industries, that the hotel industry can overcome difficulties and purchase warplanes, and other industries can also overcome difficulties, hearing the news and following suit, and will surely catch up later. If one industry is like this, and it is extended to all industries in the country, then the contribution to saving the country and ensuring survival will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>The Process of Purchasing and Dedicating the "Grains and Cereals" Aircraft - Shanghai Grains, Cereals, Oil Cakes Trade Association</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang has devoted his efforts to the Party and the nation, defending the nation, securing internal stability, and resisting external aggression, establishing the country in an era of turmoil, working tirelessly day and night to save the people from fire and water. His great achievements and magnificent deeds will shine forever like the sun and moon. His great kindness and virtue will extend to the mountains and forests. Now, on the occasion of his 50th birthday, in the year of abundant harvests, with peace and prosperity throughout the world, the people are joyful and grateful, and should express their love and support, singing praises and offering blessings to wish him long life. All sectors of this city have initiated a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft and present them to the government as a memorial to Chairman Chiang's birthday. This is also in view of the importance of national defense and strengthening air defense, which is to uphold Chairman Chiang's utmost intention for the country and the people. Our grains and cereals, oil cakes trade colleagues, encountering this grand opportunity, disregarding the extent of their strength, raised donations from goods to purchase an aircraft and incorporate it into the Zhongzheng Team to express their sincere support. Now, on the occasion of the grand ceremony of dedicating and naming aircraft in this city, we will record the process of purchasing aircraft by this association in a brief summary to fulfill this publication.</p>
<p>1. The Motivation for Donating Aircraft: Tracing back to the Shanghai War of January 28, the enemy relied on aircraft to exert its utmost efforts in ravaging. The devastation is still not recovered today. Our grains and cereals, oil cakes trade colleagues have a deep understanding of the importance of air defense. With regard to the aviation and national salvation movement, support has never dared to be behind others. This year, the proposal to raise funds in this city to purchase aircraft and present them to the government as a memorial to Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday has been initiated. The motivation for our colleagues to donate funds to purchase an aircraft has been ignited. It is not only to express our sincere love for Chairman Chiang, but also as a birthday memorial. 2. The Process of Preparing to Purchase Aircraft: After all sectors of this city decided to raise funds to purchase aircraft, our colleagues convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of this association on June 1 to decide that this association would independently purchase an aircraft. Then, on the 22nd, the Executive and Supervisory Committee was reconvened to discuss the direction of the proceedings. However, because this matter is of great importance and requires a substantial amount of funds, it cannot be collected in a hurry. Therefore, each of the eight member bodies of the association elected representatives as committee members. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association sent Cai Yukun, Chen Ziyi, and Zhu Zixiang. Ji Yuan Tang sent He Xianggu. Shen Shou Tang sent He Quansheng. Chao Sugar Industry sent Wu Zisheng. San Shan Guild Hall sent Wang Renming. Han Bang Grains and Cereals Trade sent Yu Rangzai. Gu Zhongxi of this association was the natural chairman of the committee. They jointly formed the Aircraft Purchase Birthday Greetings Fundraising Committee and agreed on a simple charter to take full responsibility for the matter. On July 3, Chairman Gu convened a meeting of the Fundraising Committee to discuss and approve the detailed rules for collecting donations on various goods, and reported them to the municipal government for record. Then the Shanghai Aircraft Purchase Fundraising Committee issued a notice to assist in the proceedings. The collection of donations on goods began on August 3, and they were submitted to the municipal committee one after another. During this preparation period, the members of this association went through consultations and did their best to work hard. The municipal committee guided the proceedings and assisted in time, which helped us even more. Today, the Shanghai Grains and Cereals aircraft is holding a naming ceremony at Longhua Flying Port. Chairman Gu Xin of this association and the representatives of all colleagues, Cai Yukun, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Shide, He Quansheng, He Xianggu, Wu Zisheng, and Jiang Hongbin, will go to the site to participate in the grand ceremony. It is truly an unparalleled honor.</p>
<h3>The Process of Fundraising and Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Greetings by the Special Industries Association</h3>
<p>The fundraising and purchase of aircraft for birthday greetings in this city has not yet raised the original amount. This association has learned of it and is willing to contribute a little effort to fulfill its duties as citizens and to show its support for the leader. With the leadership and encouragement of Mr. Du Yuesheng, this proposal was decided. Mr. She Yuesheng and Mr. Li Dachao, the general manager of the Aircraft Purchase Birthday Greetings Association, negotiated that this association would raise 100,000 yuan and allocate one aircraft, named "Shanghai Anti-Smoking." General Manager Li then reported to Mayor Wu that it was feasible. Therefore, this association was also able to participate in the naming ceremony today, following behind various sectors, and is extremely honored and grateful. Currently, the fundraising method of this association can raise about 4,000 yuan per month. Currently, 20,000 yuan has been remitted, which will be transferred to the Aircraft Purchase Birthday Greetings Association by Mr. Du Yuesheng. The insufficient amount will be raised in succession and remitted in the shortest possible time. This is the general situation of the donation fundraising in this industry.</p>

<h3>How to Be a Woman in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Wu Zizhen</p>
<p>The life of the nation has reached a critical juncture. How should our female compatriots awaken to fulfill the responsibility of self-salvation and national salvation? My opinion is that the following points must be considered:</p>
<p>First, Reform Our Hearts: We know that many female compatriots are very spirited and capable of independence, but it cannot be denied that many are doing or expecting to be appendages or toys of men! (Such as concubines and spouses whose unions are purely based on money and status.) To be a rational woman of extraordinary times, we must first eliminate this base mentality and immediately raise the banner of self-reliance and independence.</p>
<p>Second, Practice Frugality: We know that when war truly breaks out, the government needs not only weapons such as guns and cannons, but also a large amount of economic resources and food! And most of those who are appendages of men are due to their own excessive consumption. Therefore, if we want to be self-reliant and love the country, we should start with frugality ourselves.</p>
<p>Third, Shift Your Love's Focus: In general, young and promising women are often immersed in romantic dreams. Although there are many extremely valuable and noble stories among them, we cannot deny that love is a part of young people's lives. But if we make a rational critique with the interests of the country as a prerequisite, then we feel that their immersion is really a loss to the country! (Because the only people the country relies on are our young people, and the only ones who can take on the responsibility of struggle are our young people!) Therefore, although I acknowledge the nobility of love, I cannot acknowledge the supremacy of love! I do not advocate being intoxicated in the arms of a lover, dreaming of pathetic and moving dreams. I believe that women in extraordinary times should only encourage their lovers or husbands to be loyal to the country, or accompany their lovers and husbands to be loyal to the country! Women who excessively indulge in tenderness, causing men to become numb and the country to lose warriors, are truly shameful and guilty of the same crime as traitors! I hope that female compatriots who have lovers (or beloved husbands) can love the majority of compatriots with the love of a few people, and shift the focus of your love to the entire country and the entire nation!</p>
<p>Fourth, Strive to Study and Exercise: Studying can increase knowledge, and exercising can strengthen the body. After the outbreak of war, every citizen should contribute everything they have, and sacrifice their own lives and property without hesitation. But if their academic ability is insufficient or their physical strength is inadequate, they will inevitably want to sacrifice but be unable to, or sacrifice inappropriately! - But there is one point that everyone must understand: - Sacrifice does not only refer to direct sacrifice on the battlefield or in war. Providing rescue in the rear or replacing men's work is also a kind of sacrifice!</p>
<p>Women of the whole country! Female compatriots standing at the forefront of the times! You should quickly awaken and prepare to take on your own responsibilities, and with the spirit of establishing oneself and establishing others, and achieving oneself and achieving others, encourage those who are behind to work and sacrifice for the country together!</p>
<h3>National Heroine</h3>
<p>— Wen Feizi</p>
<p>Qin Liangyu was from Zhongzhou, Sichuan. She did not like to apply makeup. From a young age, she liked to ride horses and was good at archery. She often dressed as a man. Her husband was called Ma Qiancheng, and he was the Pacification Commissioner in Shigui, Sichuan. Once, there was a rebellion in Bozhou (now Zunyi, Guizhou). The situation was serious. She led 500 elite soldiers to help her husband quell the rebellion. This was a small display of her skills, and the people had already benefited greatly. Therefore, after Qiancheng died, his official position was taken over by her.</p>
<p>At that time, the Ming Dynasty's powerful enemy, the Manchus, attacked Liaodong from Manchuria, and the border defense was very tense. The government ordered Qin Liangyu to lead her troops to defend against the enemy. Her elder brother led the troops and set off first. Unfortunately, when he arrived at the Hun River (the name of a river in Liaoning), he died in battle there. Her younger brother was besieged by enemy troops and was in a critical situation. When Qin Liangyu arrived, she drove back the enemy troops and lifted the siege. People without courage and ability could not have done that.</p>
<p>When Liangyu returned to Sichuan, Chongqing was being tightly besieged by rebel troops again. She once again exerted her divine martial prowess and dispersed the enemy troops. Afterwards, the Chongqing government set up a feast to congratulate Liangyu on her achievements. This was such a glorious event!</p>
<p>However, people with ability are easily envied. There was a commander-in-chief named Li Weixin who saw Liangyu repeatedly making great achievements and was very jealous. Once, he was defeated in battle and returned to camp. Liangyu went to see him, but he refused to open the door. Therefore, Liangyu wrote a letter to the emperor saying, "Li Weixin, a six-foot-tall man, is jealous of a woman. He should feel ashamed to death when he thinks about it at night." This was truly a scolding that felt good. The emperor then issued an edict ordering all civil and military officials in Sichuan to treat Liangyu with respect and not to be suspicious of her. Our national heroine had won.</p>
<p>In the third year of Chongzhen, the border defense was alarmed again. Liangyu was ordered to move her troops. When the emperor saw that she was loyal to the country and not afraid of hardship, he summoned her to the platform and gave her four poems, with two lines inside: "There are not a few extraordinary men in the world, but who is willing to travel thousands of miles on the battlefield." In his words, he revealed infinite emotion, and Liangyu's loyalty and courage can be imagined.</p>
<p>Later, the bandit Zhang Xianzhong attacked Sichuan. The Sichuan authorities failed to adopt Liangyu's strategy, which led to the rampant banditry and no way to resist. Sichuan was ravaged by him, and the smoke was desolate, with nine out of ten houses empty. However, Shigui was never breached by the bandits, which was also the result of Liangyu and the people working together to resist. While the entire province was devastated, one side was clean. The name of the national heroine Qin Liangyu was known to everyone and became a national heroine admired by people throughout the ages.</p>

<h3>Ms. Du Yufei's Thoughts on Touring Europe</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Hungarians are the most patriotic and can serve as our role models! German and Italian women are the most hardworking, providing equal service to men.</p>
<p>Following the closing of the Olympic Games, the nation felt a thousand sorrows and regrets, considering it a major stain on China's sporting history. Especially those in the sports world expressed their views and debated the matter. Although there is still no comprehensive plan for advancement, everyone has deeply awakened, realizing it's never too late to mend the fold and catch up quickly, determined not to fail forever. Frankly speaking, as a weak nation like ours, we lag behind in everything, let alone sports, which is a common matter! A few days ago, I met Ms. Du Yufei, the principal of the China Women's Physical Education Normal School, who accompanied the sports delegation to Europe this time. She heard and saw a lot, and was deeply moved. I presented some opinions, and she responded to each one. Below is a quick sketch of the conversation:</p>
<p>"What was the itinerary and route of the sports delegation's trip to Europe?"</p>
<p>"The delegation consisted of 37 people, including eight women. We left the country at the end of June and returned to Shanghai on October 3, spending 99 days on the road. We passed through nine countries, including Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, and India. We stayed in Germany for a longer time, and the rest were just brief sightseeing tours, like watching flowers from horseback."</p>
<p>"What are your impressions of this year's Olympics?"</p>
<p>"The press has reported extensively on the various aspects of the Games. Now, I would like to offer a few personal impressions: Overseas, I felt that our national spirit was very poor. The people of other countries acted with complete discipline, prioritizing the country over the individual. We were ashamed of our inferiority. The main reasons for the delegation's failure were: first, we lacked physical strength and sufficient nutrition; second, we lacked long-term training; third, we lacked on-the-spot experience. For example, in basketball, our technique was not bad, but the players were flustered and didn't know what to do, resulting in a disastrous loss that far exceeded expectations; fourth, the athletes' lives were too undisciplined, and too few people could abide by the rules; fifth, everyone lacked a sense of responsibility and disregarded the country's reputation. For example, when they went abroad, the athletes always complained about being unaccustomed to the food, and one got sick, then another, keeping the doctors busy and causing a lot of jokes, which is hard to put into words. When they returned home, they were all cheerful and didn't feel any remorse for their failure! What do you think? Let bygones be bygones. In the future, we should work hard. The next Games will be held in Japan. To talk about winning the championship might be too extravagant. I advocate that in addition to individual competitions, group performances are also very meaningful. Like this year's Games, various countries had large-scale performances with thousands of people, including various group exercises and dances, some expressing the martial spirit of the nation, and others promoting their inherent arts. Our country should also participate in group performances in the next Games. China's sports policy should be fundamentally reformed, starting from the family, to make parents aware of the importance of children's sports, cultivate their adventurousness, and focus on basic training. Chinese people eat too well, but lack nutrition, resulting in uneven physical development, which is also a major problem. The next Olympics will be in Italy, which is eight years away, but Italy has already started building the venue, on a scale larger than Germany's. That is truly planning ahead, and their dedication is admirable."</p>
<p>"What are your impressions of the emerging trends in various countries?"</p>
<p>"Our trip was aimed at studying sports in various countries, but we also paid attention to local customs and national conditions, and the education system. I personally found the most satisfying aspects to be the comfortable lives of the Danish people and the solemn courtesy towards foreign guests, which demonstrated the high level of the people. Denmark has stricter compulsory education than other countries, with almost all children aged six to fourteen receiving national education. The Swedish people are not much different from the Danish. Germany's material construction is the most magnificent and grand. The Italian nation is fiercely arrogant! Public sports in Czechoslovakia are the most widespread, with everyone receiving the benefits of physical education. When sports meets are held, hundreds of thousands of people participate in performances, which is incredibly exciting. In many emerging European countries, people's patriotic sentiments are very high. Among them, the Hungarians left the deepest impression on me. When we left Hungary, an employee of the hotel asked the delegation to sign their names. Mr. Hao Gengsheng wrote, 'May our beautiful rivers and mountains soon return to their rightful owners.' After explaining the meaning, the employee immediately shed tears, showing an unparalleled fervor for national restoration. At the main transportation hub in Budapest, there is a park that flies a half-mast flag all year round, reportedly to be raised to full mast after the country's territory is restored. The park is decorated with various national humiliation slogans made of flowers and plants, which are startling. Four stone statues stand at the corners, with rough textures and ugly faces, representing the four lost territories. Each time a territory is recovered, one statue will be smashed. Furthermore, the layers of postal postcards are printed with maps, showing the location of the lost territories at a glance. Just mentioning a few points can prove the depth of the Hungarian people's commemoration of national humiliation. Looking back at our country, we have lost more territory and suffered deeper national humiliation, but how does the national patriotic sentiment of our people compare to that of the Hungarians? Take Germany, a newly rising country, for example. Munich (transliteration), the third largest city in Germany, is the birthplace of the German revolution. There, a National Humiliation Memorial Hall has been built, with six wreaths placed on top and the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes built beside it, with eight paulownia coffins, also commemorating the lost territories and honoring national heroes. When Germans pass by this place, they must salute to show their respect."</p>
<p>"After touring Europe, what are your opinions on the women of various countries?"</p>
<p>"The women of the countries I saw all wore simple clothes, especially in Germany and Italy. Unless they were at social banquets, you could hardly see high heels or makeup. But they were physically strong and had the same spirit of service as men. In Germany, labor service is not divided by gender. From the age of eighteen, one must join the labor corps and serve for one year. For example, the reception centers and dormitories for this year's Games were entirely staffed by male and female students, and those from middle schools and universities worked very seriously. Their spirit of hard work and endurance far exceeds that of Chinese youth."</p>
<p>We talked for a long time that day. The above paragraphs contain relatively profound meanings and are worth reporting truthfully to readers.</p>
<p>The five female members of the delegation to Europe were all alumni of Ginling College. The first person on the left is President Wu Yifang. The third person is Ms. Du.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Fifteen-Year-Old Tennis Flower - Miss He Aiying's Tennis Skills</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>This time, the Chinese athletes participated in the World Games, and the results were that every item ended up with the loss of the game, causing everyone to gasp in cold air; but on the other hand, we got a piece of gratifying news, that is, the Chinese Miss He Aiying, who resides in England, has made amazing progress in her tennis performance. In addition to winning the British Wimbledon Junior Group Championship, on September 22, she also won the singles championship of the French Women's Junior Tennis Tournament.</p>
<p>Miss He is only fifteen years old this year, and her parents went to England to do business a long time ago; therefore, she was born in England. She has been very lively since she was a child. Her parents also liked to play tennis after work, so Ms. He has had the opportunity to play tennis since she was a child, and her tennis skills have improved year by year like her age. However, her amazing tennis skills have not been discovered in England until two years ago, when she joined the junior competition at the age of thirteen, and then this overseas Chinese tennis flower was discovered.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Miss He has indeed had many amazing performances in London, because although she is so petite, British female tennis players, all of the second and third class, have been defeated by her. When we think back, in April of this year, after she participated in the women's singles competition of the Melbourne Tennis Club Open Tennis Tournament in London, every British female player was defeated by her until she entered the final week before being defeated by the British female tennis player Miss Dorothy Round. Originally, Miss Round was a first-class British female tennis player, and Miss He's body was petite, and her physical strength was far inferior to that of Miss Round, so her failure was expected, but during the competition, she had given Miss Round a great threat.</p>
<p>In September of this year, she participated in the Wimbledon Women's Singles in England and won the championship, taking away a large silver cup; but then on September 22, she defeated the famous Parisian female tennis player Glenier by 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 and won the French Junior Tennis Championship, the news spread and shocked the entire European sports community. Her tennis skills, in this way, have indeed been noticed by European tennis experts. Anyone who has witnessed her performance believes that her future is very bright.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation mentioned above, Miss He's tennis skills are probably impossible to find a second person in the country, right? She has won a lot of face for the Chinese people internationally. Such a female tennis player will easily become a first-class female player in a few years. I hope that the officials in charge of Chinese sports will not neglect this female tennis flower drifting in a foreign country. If she can represent China in international tennis competitions in the future, she will definitely be able to win honor for China because she is only fifteen years old now, and in the next few years, the progress of her tennis skills will be amazingly rapid, which can be expected. Undoubtedly, her future is the most promising.</p>
<h3>Pregnancy and Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Zifu</p>
<p>Pregnancy means that from that moment on, the mother's body is not only nourishing itself, but also nourishing a new life with vigorous vitality. Therefore, special attention must be paid to nutrition during this period. Even with good nutrition, pregnant women often do not exhibit a perfectly adequate nutritional state.</p>
<p>Many people experience dental problems during pregnancy. This is because the calcium needed to build the fetus's bones is taken from the teeth. Calcium not only nourishes the teeth, but also provides resistance to caries. Since the mother's calcium is taken by the fetus, the mother's resistance is reduced. During the summer pregnancy, it is easy to contract diseases such as tuberculosis if one is not careful. When a pregnant woman's body has a slight fever, it is sometimes a symptom of the early stages of tuberculosis, so a doctor must be consulted immediately for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Especially during the transition from summer to autumn, most ordinary people exhibit weakened gastrointestinal resistance and decreased appetite. Pregnant women during this period have even weaker resistance and require particularly good nutrition. They should eat more nourishing and rich foods and pay attention to methods of preventing weakness in order to maintain the mother's health. If symptoms of malnutrition occur, a doctor should be consulted immediately to determine what nutrients are lacking in the body. Then, the doctor should instruct them on what to consume so as not to affect the health of the mother and fetus. However, this still cannot be regarded as anything more than a remedial measure. In fact, it is best to pay attention in advance and consume foods that are rich and balanced in nutrients so as not to become malnourished.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the nutrients necessary to maintain health and prevent weakness can be obtained from everyday foods. However, we should also pay attention to selecting foods that are of good nutritional value in our daily diet. At the same time, we should not be picky eaters, and all kinds of nutrients should be taken in appropriate amounts.</p>
<p>Another point to note is that one must have a strong digestive and absorptive gastrointestinal tract. To strengthen the function of the gastrointestinal tract, it is best to regularly consume things that can strengthen the tissue cells of the gastrointestinal tract and invigorate the digestive and absorptive functions. If one can do so and at the same time not be a picky eater of one or two items, then the necessary nutrients can be obtained from everyday foods.</p>
<h3>The Subconscious (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Indeed, the carving company run by Liu Yifan had no business at all, relying entirely on his father to support him; and at the same time, he really had no intention of pursuing women. However, the lack of business was one thing, and not wanting to marry was another, and there was no such close relationship between the two as his friends and relatives thought, because Yifan, although he had no money, his father had expressed his willingness to help him get married several times, but he had refused. The real reason was that he still wanted to work hard to study his carving, hoping to achieve more success in art, and because his consciousness was so pure and constantly striving upward, he saw only a thin ray of light, and nothing else.</p>
<p>But after another half year or so, the subconscious action was performed by this young artist.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, Liu ××, the commander of the Northwest Border Defense, was unfortunately injured and killed in the campaign to suppress the Red bandits. The central government and the local people had a good impression of General Liu, so they decided to build a bronze statue for him in Lanzhou. After several selections and biddings, the business unexpectedly fell into Liu Yifan's hands. He was naturally very excited, and after half a year, he had prepared all the models and stone bases. In order to save trouble during transportation, he decided to send one person to send all the necessary materials over first, and then set off himself, planning to move the remaining part of the work to Lanzhou. Once the idea was settled, he was happy that he had no family and did not need to be delayed, so on a autumn morning, he embarked on his journey.</p>
<p>First to Xi'an, then change to the long-distance bus on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. Because the highway was too bad, this kind of car often ran sometimes and sometimes not. The day Yifan arrived in Xi'an, it was unfortunate that there were some problems on the highway again, and the highway bureau temporarily announced the suspension of traffic. Yifan had to stay temporarily at the Xi'an Guest House of the China Travel Service. He had nothing to do at night and went to bed very early. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly awakened by a rude noise in the middle of the night. He listened carefully and it seemed that someone was fighting next door, and there was also a woman crying. At first, he thought that some bandits had come and was very panicked. Later, after listening carefully, there seemed to be people inside persuading him, and the woman's crying was not very urgent, which was different from the usual situation of robbery. Yifan was relieved; but the man still stretched his rough, hoarse voice and scolded as much as possible, and the woman also cried as much as possible, which really made Yifan unable to sleep. After a long time, probably the accountant went in to persuade them, and the quarrel between the couple stopped, but the sky was almost dawn.</p>
<p>The next day, the bus actually ran. When Yifan hired a car from the guest house to the station, he saw a fat man in military uniform taking a woman behind him to call for a car; when he arrived at the station, it happened that the fat man was also buying tickets, and he was also buying tickets to Lanzhou. Yifan originally had no need to pay attention to them, so he pretended not to see them, but when he heard the fat man speak, the voice was very familiar. After thinking about it, it turned out that he was the one who had scolded his wife last night.</p>
<p>Special Piece</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home Over the Past Fifteen Years (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Liu Wang Liming</p>
<p>The Motivation for the Launch</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Movement began fifty years ago in Zhenjiang. When this trend surged from the Yangtze River basin to both sides of the Huangpu River, women in Shanghai also had many temperance organizations, including the Shanghai South and North Women's Temperance Societies, as well as the Student Temperance Society and the Children's Temperance Army. At that time, the president was Dr. Shi Meiyu, and the staff members included Ms. Mei Yunying, Ms. Liu Jingfang, and myself. The launch of this Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home is closely related to me. At first, I was responsible for the youth work in the association. One day, the Shanghai Temperance Student Federation held a discussion meeting in my office. I said that the association's youth members, in addition to personally abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and evil, should unite to do something that is really beneficial to society. At that time, I had just returned from overseas and saw that the streets in other countries were neatly organized. I proposed to establish a women and children's education and welfare home in Shanghai to accommodate and educate some of the wandering women, children, and beggars on the streets, as well as other unfortunate people, and to pioneer the anti-beggary movement, giving a lifeline to those in desperate situations. The emotions of the young people were as hot as fire. After my advocacy, everyone raised their hands in agreement, and the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home was conceived at this time.</p>
<p>The Opening Fee of Four Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The principle of establishing the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home was approved, and the second step of work was to draft the articles of association. The third and difficult step of work began. Everyone felt their pockets, and the most they had was only five yuan. To start an education and welfare home with this amount, at least half a year must be maintained. What an impossible thing this is! So when the chairman proposed to discuss the budget, everyone lowered their heads, and some may have regretted that they should not have been so excited at the beginning.</p>
<p>At this time, I stood up and said: "No matter what we do, as long as we have the determination, we can always do it. Like this work of saving beggars, there must be many sympathetic people in the city. How about we hold a charity show?"</p>
<p>The atmosphere of hope, joy, and courage returned to the meeting room. In less than ten minutes of discussion, everyone decided to hold a charity show, and I was elected to write a drama, and they were responsible for the rest of the programs.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the places of entertainment are the best in the country. In the crowd who are infatuated with foreign movies and Chinese Peking opera, it is not easy to hold an ordinary charity show!</p>
<p>"Since you plan to do it, don't be afraid." I encouraged the members with this spirit. Finally, Mr. Zheng Zegu and Mr. Zheng Zhengdi of the Mingxing Film Company and a large group of actors were also invited to help. Later, I couldn't find anyone to play the main role, so I had to take on the role myself.</p>
<p>The Xin Wutai on Wumu Land was the location for the performance. A total of about 900 yuan of tickets were sold, but after paying 300 yuan for the stage fee and 200 yuan for printing, transportation, equipment, and other fees, the balance at the time of the final clearance was only 400 yuan, which was the founding fee of the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home!</p>
<p>From Ximen to Jiangwan</p>
<p>The ancients said that "starting a business is difficult", but "maintaining a business" and developing it is even more difficult. Within two or three years, the enthusiastic young members moved away, found jobs, went to school, got married, and so on. Except for myself, there were almost no second person left. Fortunately, at this time, the competent authority—the Chinese Women's Temperance Association—itself underwent a huge change in its organization, changing from a president system to a board of directors system. I took the opportunity to reorganize the association's work, establishing three departments: Drug Resistance, Family Harmony, and Beggar Relief, and placing the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home under the Beggar Relief Department. Although the name has now been changed to the Social Service Department due to the development of the business. Four hundred yuan is indeed a very small amount to start a charitable organization, but in order to implement their original intentions and the credibility of society, the colleagues and others were even more courageous and established this tool for rescuing beggars—the Hai Women and Children's Education and Welfare Home—in a poor people's residence in Ximen.</p>

<h3>All-City Games Day 2: East Asia Firmly Secures Three Championships; Physical Education Male Group and Physical Education Teachers' Groups (Both Male and Female) Secured; University Male Group Championship Likely to Belong to Chih Chih; Great China Sweeps University and Physical Education Female Groups; Tense Competition Today, Games Extended to Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>The city's Fourth All-City Games was held yesterday for the second day. Except for the relay and 10,000-meter scheduled events that could not be held in time, the remaining events were rushed to completion amidst the dimming twilight. The Open, University, and Physical Education groups only have the 10,000-meter race and women's softball throw remaining. The organizing committee decided to extend the closing ceremony by half a day. The 10,000-meter race and the second half of the decathlon will be moved to the morning of the 25th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Athletics Situation</p>
<p>In the university group, Chih Chih leads for the men's schools, and Great China for the women's schools. In the physical education group, East Asia leads for the men's schools, and Great China for the women's schools. In the physical education teachers' group, East Asia leads for both men and women. This can already be determined. In the high school group, Fuhsing is in the lead, but with many events yet to be completed, the Private Shanghai High School will surely catch up. In the women's division, Minli Girls' High School made a surprising splash, scoring fourteen points alone. Shanghai Provincial High School should also not be underestimated. However, in track events, Patriotic Girls' School and Wuben Girls' School may increase their scores. In the junior high school men's division, Chen Nan Middle School emerged unexpectedly, while Guangdong East Middle School still needs to work hard. In the women's division, Wuben seems to have no problem. Today, the high school and junior high school groups are at a crucial juncture, and the competition will be more intense than in other groups.</p>

<h3>Thriving National Arts Competition: Wrestlers Abundant in Talent; Women's Archery Features Prominent Figures; Weightlifting Competition Includes Women Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Arts group held wrestling preliminary rounds in the morning and wrestling semi-finals in the afternoon, as well as men's and women's archery and pellet shooting competitions. A total of twenty-four people participated in wrestling, including two women. However, due to significant differences in weight and different levels, the women were canceled from the competition. Eight men were divided into lightweight and middleweight classes, with Tong Zhongyi, Wang Ziping, Wu Jianquan, and Liu Desheng serving as judges. The head of the National Arts judges, Mr. Chu Minyi, was still present to supervise everything. The wrestlers who participated this time were all very talented and had considerable skill. The most outstanding were Yang Guanshou, Lü Yaohua, Wang Yongcai, Zhu Rubie, Hong Zhifang, Jin Chuncheng, etc. in the lightweight class. They leaped and bounded, putting forth their full effort to compete. The most exciting matches were No. 1268 vs. No. 1246, No. 1239 vs. No. 1279, and No. 1318 vs. No. 1319, etc., where both sides were evenly matched and wrestled extremely fiercely, which was highly appreciated by the audience in the venue. In the afternoon, the wrestling semi-finals and the men's and women's archery and pellet shooting competitions were held, with Zhang Qidong, Luo Shuqing, Chen Xuliang, and Zhu Lianxiang serving as judges. The first place in men's archery was Jia Zhishan, and the second place was Xu Yushu. The first place in women's archery was Chi Guiyun, the second was Kang Xinyao, and the third was Wu Junhua. It is noted that Tong Guiyun, the first-place winner in women's archery, is the daughter of the famous national arts master Tong Zhongyi, who comes from a family with a long tradition in the field, making her achievements exceptional. The second-place winner, Kang Xinxuan, is a modern woman with a perm and leather shoes. It is said that she had won silver and blue medals in archery competitions in Sichuan.

<p>Commercial News: Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Too High, Guest Merchants Take Profits and Sell;</p>
<p>Forward Sales Particularly Brisk;</p>
<p>Market Suddenly Reports a Decline</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising sharply, suddenly reported a decline yesterday. However, a certain merchant has already turned from short to long. According to market rumors, there is talk of a coordinated short squeeze in the November contract, so the November contract is standing alone. This month, they are determined to take delivery. However, current yarn business is turning sluggish because prices are too high, customers are pausing, and some guest merchants are taking profits and selling. Therefore, November yarn currently has a priority position due to the lack of spot yarn. However, it is still early; if spot yarn is quiet, the factory's position should loosen, and as prices have reached a high level, transactions have greatly decreased. The market closed at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The "Taking Delivery" Rumor Remains Strong in Near Months</p>
<p>At the opening of the tagged yarn market, a certain gentleman's plan to take delivery this month caused a firm rise of 5 jiao. Other forward months also rose 2-3 jiao. In the first session, near months did not move, while forward months declined due to sluggish yarn sales and relaxed sentiment. In the third session, near months fell back 7-8 jiao, while forward months remained flat. Market transactions were very quiet. The market closed at 11:30 AM. Near months then rebounded, while forward months were slightly weak. As a result, each month fell 2.5-6.9 jiao compared to the previous day's close, except for this month, which rose 5 jiao. At the afternoon opening, this month's transactions were very few, and prices were very high and did not move. Forward months were weak due to brisk selling as spot yarn transactions had stalled. In the second session, this month suddenly fell, but a certain merchant came to buy, and the price was lifted back up. The rest remained flat. By the close, it was heard that the Tianjin gang and others were selling, and the table suddenly loosened. The downtrend in forward months was strong again, and near months were also weak. As a result, each month fell another 1.4-1.8 yuan compared to the morning close. Changfeng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon, selling 2,100 bales of Juxing, 1,050 bales of Jinchang, 1,800 bales of Mingde, 3,700 bales of Shenji, 1,450 bales of Dachang, 1,700 bales of Xincheng, 1,200 bales of Senkang, 950 bales of Yongchang, and 850 bales of Fengtai. They bought 2,100 bales of Hengyi, 3,400 bales of Gengfeng, 1,000 bales of Shenchang, 1,800 bales of Taichang, 850 bales of Hengchang, 650 bales of Yongda, 750 bales of Tongfeng, 800 bales of Dachangcheng, 800 bales of Hexing, and 800 bales of Wangtaixing. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 809,450</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Quiet</p>
<p>It is found that the total amount bought by various gangs throughout the day is 500 bales, and the selling price has fallen by 1-2 yuan. Thread prices have fallen sharply by more than 10 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>

<p>Fellow Traders 205 Fujian 5 Xuzhou 5 Shorts Have Already Submitted Spot Goods</p>
<p>Cotton Downtrend is Strong</p>
<p>Except for March, All Fell Below the 20 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The cotton market is declining, and the momentum is weakening. This is because the shorts have already submitted spot goods, totaling 117,000 dan. Therefore, the longs are greatly disappointed, and the enthusiastic atmosphere is gradually disappearing. However, the longs have not abandoned the amount absorbed in large quantities, while the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are becoming increasingly weak.</p>
<p>Tagged Cotton: Ningbo Gang Sells Off</p>
<p>At the opening of the tagged cotton market, the current month's contract rose 2.5 jiao because Yudai exclusively purchased 5,000 dan, and the market sentiment turned tight. Forward months were calm. In the first session, each month turned downward because the overseas cotton market was weak, and the Ningbo gang and Mingde sold off, and the downtrend became strong again. By the third session, the market situation was still not strong. As a result, each month fell 1.5-3.5 jiao compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, the current month's contract fell further because of the delivery of physical goods, suddenly falling 3 jiao. Forward months were affected downward, and the second and third sessions were flat. By the close, Baofeng's momentum was strong, and sentiment was greatly relaxed. Except for March, all other months fell below the 42 yuan mark. As a result, each month fell another 3.5-4.5 jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Mingde sold 9,400 dan, Hengyi 2,800 dan, Jinghua 1,700 dan, Zhenda 2,700 dan, Wangtaixing 7,100 dan, Dachangcheng 4,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 6,000 dan, Shenji 3,500 dan, Runkang 3,600 dan, and Dachang 4,700 dan.

<p>Again, Again Another Week of Inside Story of the Sharp Rise and Fall of Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The standard cotton yarn market has experienced a dramatic rise since Monday of this week, like a raging horse. The front three months of contracts all reached their daily limit, and market sentiment reached a peak. The market situation was extremely chaotic, and both long and short parties frequently entered and exited with chips. The daily auction closed late at night, a new record in the history of the exchange. This month's cotton yarn happens to be approaching the delivery period. General floating accounts, in view of the improved environment, are eager to cover, so the price skyrocketed 20 yuan in three days. The reason for the increase is said to be active yarn sales, empty spot goods, and a short squeeze. On the one hand, spot traders are particularly eager to hoard, and at the same time, a major player has turned from short to long. For a time, the chips were insufficient to circulate, and they raised each other, so the rise continued and reached a new peak in five years. This month's cotton had Chen coarse lint cotton delivered. Following this, the old and new long companies from before had disputes over mortgage issues. The cotton stacked in various warehouses could not be inspected under escrow, and it was feared that it would be difficult to fulfill the delivery, so people were panicked, and the rise became more intense. The October cotton contract jumped 2.1 yuan in one day on the 21st to 43.5 yuan, also jumping 3.55 yuan compared to the price on the 17th of this month. Then, on the 22nd, the market situation took a sharp turn for the worse, with the price plummeting 1.55 yuan in the first session. According to market rumors, the board of directors held a late-night meeting. As a result, if the long party takes delivery, they will first collect the warehouse receipts, and the authorities will be responsible for recovering compensation if unqualified, out-of-shape situations occur after inspection. A storm has temporarily subsided, so the long party is greatly disappointed, and the market price quickly fell back. Today, the market has gradually calmed down, and transactions between the two sides have greatly decreased. In fact, after days of frantic rises and sharp falls, both sides are exhausted. The exchange also added two special gold batches to curb new trading, so transactions have naturally decreased. Moreover, the market price has risen too much, and more and more customers have taken profits and sold. News reports that speculation will be curbed, so the market trend has become more moderate. Spot yarn and thread have fallen back sharply, and customer sales have entered a state of stagnation due to excessive prices. It is found that the spot yarn price has fallen back 7-9 yuan compared to the peak price on the 23rd, and the 42-count thread price has fallen sharply by 46 yuan. The tagged yarn has only fallen back 2.5 yuan, and the tagged cotton has also fallen back 2.5 yuan. This huge change is rare in history. However, there are rumors that a certain gentleman in the November contract is undergoing a short squeeze. The future depends on actual needs. The current spot yarn, thread, and cotton yarn situation in the three days is recorded below:</p>

<p>American Cotton Buying Competition Is Fierce</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month falling 1-3 points. In the early morning, the Liverpool news was not good, and the longs liquidated. Then the same industry bought in, and the situation reversed again. Domestic and foreign colleagues bought in near months, Liverpool sold off forward months, retail investors bought in, encountering sporadic hedging, and the two sides competed fiercely. Weather forecasts predicted frost in Oklahoma and Arkansas, and cold waves in the east, which slightly curbed selling sentiment. The market closed steadily, with spot prices falling 3 points and futures prices falling 1-5 points. English cotton spot prices fell 9 points, and futures prices fell 4-6 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to buying by short accounts and exporters, but later weakened due to liquidation by old longs and bad Liverpool news. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell 0.25 Robi, Aomula fell half a Robi, and Bairoxi fell 0.75 Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 22nd):</p>

<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast on the 23rd was Bairoxi at 221 Robi, unchanged; Aomula at 198.5 Robi, unchanged; and Pingguoer at 159 Robi, down 0.25 Robi.</p>
<p>Three-Product Cotton Yarn Falls Slightly</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 23rd: Three-product futures yarn fell 4 jiao to 1.3 yuan, with near months at 223.6 yuan and forward months at 207.1 yuan. Futures cotton fell 1 jiao to 2.5 fen, with near months at 65.65 yuan and forward months at 65.95 yuan.</p>
<p>American Cotton Private Estimate</p>
<p>New York telegram on the 22nd: Hill's Company's ginning estimate for this season is 8,388,000 bales. The US Cotton Collection Office's ginning estimate is 7,936,000 bales.</p>
<p>Piece Goods:</p>
<p>Hand Goods Released, Cotton Cloth Falls Back</p>
<p>Velvet Market Strong Alone</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market turned downstream due to the reversal of cotton yarn prices for several consecutive days. Demand gradually stagnated, sentiment relaxed, and speculators eagerly sought to sell. Various cloths on the market gradually had spot goods because the rising trend in Shanghai has become increasingly fierce recently. Although it is now tending to settle, the market price has become high. According to the sales areas, the sales prices in various places are cheaper than in Shanghai. According to the current Shanghai market, it is possible to pack back and make a profit, so they do not ask about the new price at all, only urging the previously set low-priced goods. Transactions are very light. However, there are a large number of unfinished deliveries of plain and colored cloths from various factories, so the factories are still diligently dispatching goods and do not have any inventory. The weather is getting colder, and the sales market for dark blue cloth is becoming increasingly prosperous. The inventories of Changjiang, Sichuan, Fujian, Shandong, and other factories are more than 1,000 boxes, and they are gradually being sold out. The market prices are also gradually rising back. Eastern goods, fine cloth, market cloth, 84 cloth, and fine twill, have continued to fall by (per piece) about 1 jiao due to the release of low-priced hand goods. The market for coarse cloth and fine twill from this factory is stable. The prices of dyed goods, Zhigong, serge, and line are also slightly softening. Only the velvet label is still firm and high because the output limits of various factories this year are too harsh and insufficient for market sales. Yesterday, the sales opening price of Yihua Factory's Fufu white French velvet was 11.5 yuan (per piece), more than 1 yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>Grain:</p>
<p>Northern Sales Active</p>
<p>Flour Wants to Fall But Turns Back Up</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning, and the market for each month initially showed a downward trend, but then rebounded strongly due to active sales and factory replenishment. When the price was opened, the price of foreign wheat differed by 1 jiao, and Liverpool also had a sharp downward trend, so market sentiment and speculative sentiment fell sharply, and people actively sold off. The opening price for the current month fell by 4-5 fen, and forward months also continued to fall slightly by 1-2 fen. However, after this, due to factory replenishment in the near term and not many hedging in the long term, sentiment recovered again, and the near term was 2-3 fen better than the initial opening. The February and March contracts rebounded slightly by about 2 fen. By the time the afternoon opened, the situation suddenly became tense again, and the increase compared to the initial price in the morning reached as much as 6-7-8 fen because the factory was replenishing heavily this month, and northern customers were buying in due to active sales, so the weak situation was transformed into an exciting one. Because people's hearts are already heated, this kind of wave cannot be calmed down in a short time.</p>

<p>March 3.8450 3.7900 3.8425 Up 0.0300</p>
<p>Futures Wheat Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market opened in the morning, and each month was generally weak because people still felt uneasy due to the previous sharp fall. Therefore, at the time of opening, the current month was still stable, and the months from November onwards still fell sharply by 6-7 fen to 1 jiao. However, the market rebounded due to the recovery of the flour market, and sentiment turned stable. Compared to the initial opening, it rebounded by about 4-5 fen. By the time the afternoon opened, transactions were relatively sparse, and the market atmosphere gradually became stable because although the market value was high, wheat production had already fallen, and grain prices in various places were soaring. Therefore, if the government does not take appropriate measures, speculators will still be eager to act. The current wheat market is still holding up. The opening price for Shandong Wuhe wheat is 6 yuan, the second price is 5 yuan 9.8 fen, Mingguang Yanghe wheat is 5 yuan 9.5 fen, the second price is 9 jiao, Yaowan wheat is 5 yuan 8.2 fen, the second price is 8.2 fen, Jiangbei wheat is 5 yuan 7.8 fen, Shaoxing wheat is 5 yuan 7.8 fen, Hefei wheat is 5 yuan 8 jiao, and Nanjing wheat is 5 yuan 5.2 fen. Fuxin handled 3,000 bags, and Shenda handled 7,000 bags.</p>

<p>Ke Xian Northern Sales Particularly Brisk</p>
<p>Ke Xian was very popular yesterday and the day before, but yesterday the Guangdong and Shantou streets were both sluggish and the rising trend has been frustrated. The market seemed to be trending lower, but the northern sales were active, In addition to the Tianjin gang, Shandong and other roads also had arrangements, and other retail investors also had intentions, because the northern rice, wheat, and flour have been depleted since the initial procurement, and the price has gradually increased. In the future, or it will be necessary to transport to Shanghai, so the market has seen stability because people hope for good results. The Cantonese gang and Shantou also made inquiries, and the sales prices of each stall are still similar to the previous market. The statistics show that Jiangxi rice was sold for 2,530 bags, Hunan rice for 5,400 bags, Taiwan rice for 276 bags, and factory rice for 50 bags.</p>
<p>The Arrival Route of the New Yin Yuan Wang is Sluggish</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs only arrived at more than 20 numbers. The goods were all fixed in place. Sales in this street were normal, but the bag stomach was still smooth. The Tianjin, Qingyan, Dalian and other gangs continued to handle 1,450 bags of thick new japonica rice, more than 1,000 bags of thin new indica rice, and more than 300 bags of broken indica rice. Therefore, as a result, the market situation is still pretty good. The price of thick and thin new japonica rice is increased by 1 jiao half, the price of Dujian is also good for 5 fen, the supply and demand of foreign rice is imitated, and there is no honor or disgrace. The situation of thick and thin broken japonica rice is also good, but the new Yin Yuan rice has a sudden surge of source due to the daily arrival, and the route is sluggish, and the market has plummeted by more than half a yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs in Hexia were thirty-three or four. The sales of various rice in the market turned weak. Only the new Bian Yuan Zero dismantling was quite popular. The kiln species was short of goods. The high-priced goods in the morning market for new japonica rice were tight, and the medium and second prices continued to rise by two or three jiao. The noon market gradually stabilized. The new Bian Yuan goods were scarce, and the price rose by about 3 jiao. Broken rice was also tight by a few fen to 1 jiao, and the high price of Yangshebu tip rice rose by about 1 jiao, and the medium and second prices were tight by a few fen. Kejian was added to the price,</p>
<p>Finance:</p>
<p>Gold Market Swings Uncertainly</p>
<p>Transactions Include Both Buying and Selling</p>
<p>Finally Fell Back by 3 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was mostly engaged in both buying and selling in the market, and it was extremely stable at first. Later, due to the addition of short positions and the increase in the price of Indian silver, it began to be unsustainable. It was found that in the early morning, the overseas silver market, the English market rose and the American market was flat. The forward silver price in Monde Li rose by 1.5-2%, the exchange rate opened and closed, London raw gold shrank by half a penny, and the Central Bank's listed exchange rate remained the same for both the UK and the US. The customs gold unit did not move, and the listed standard gold price was reduced to 1155 yuan and 4 jiao. Pre-market transactions opened, retreated to about 56 yuan and a half, and there were not many transactions. The morning opened low, and after the opening, buyers began to be slightly active. HSBC's listed prices were announced, and both the UK and the US were flat, and the silver balance tax was announced without any movement, and it gradually pulled up. The shorts still added at high prices, and then turned stable, but the difference was limited, and the number of transactions was sparse. The mid-day was sluggish, and the market was stable in the afternoon, and the number of transactions was even more sparse, but there were many people engaged in both buying and selling. At first, it was stagnant at 57 yuan for a long time, and later the shorts came to add slightly, and the buyers watched for a while, and the longs closed and turned down. The price of Indian silver rose by three Annas, but the big players maintained it at a low price, and the second price of Indian silver was also flat, and finally it was settled. The market conditions for one day will be recorded later,</p>
