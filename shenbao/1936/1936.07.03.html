<h3 id="c22">徵收所得稅問題 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>最近我們對於稅制改革方面最感興趣的要算是計劃就緒的所得稅了</p>
<p>一國健全的稅制應當以直接稅爲主間接稅爲輔我國最大的稅源是關稅其决是鹽稅再次是統稅這三項稅源雖佔了每年財政收入的絕犬部份但都是間接稅不但負擔不均且彈性很小不能隨時伸縮於國庫收支很不便利在承平的時候也許還可勉力支持設一遇變故稅收必將短絀而支出也將難以應付所以我國的稅制亟有逐漸以直接稅爲主要稅源的必要直接稅中最重要的是所得稅現在財政當局已擬具所得稅法草案呈經行政院轉送中政會通過交立法院完成立法手續而最近立法院通過的民國二十五年度國家總預算案也已把所得稅列入歲入項下開徵之期當不在遠吧</p>
<p>所得稅的最大優點有四一是負擔公平國民納稅的能力因貧富而不同所得稅根據能力原則用累進稅率將富有者的義務酌量增加可以補比例稅的缺陷二是納稅普及普通各稅大抵祗課及一部份國民所得稅則一般國民在納稅標準以上者都要隨其所得的大小分別負担納稅的義務三是收入穩固徵收所得稅在一定期間都有可靠的收入四是富有伸縮力一般租稅多不易隨時變更稅率徵收所得稅的對象都是中產以上的人民在承平時代可以把稅率降低增進他們的富力遇有必要的時候稍稍提高稅率可使政府便於籌得緊急的費用所得稅因爲有這四大優點故已成爲各先進國家的稅收主要部份</p>
<p>所得稅旣是良稅而在我國還是初創自宜愼重從事以期成功下面二個大前提希望常局在開徵以前特別注意</p>
<p>第一稅法應求詳稅率應求低從富有者方面着想勿促他亟於逃避從貧苦者方面着想勿使他苦於負荷開始征收的時候祗求公平而易於負担逐漸養成納稅的習慣第二開徵所得稅前須要有外交上的努力求得國際的諒解和協助因爲租界和在蕪外國銀行的存在很能使富有者托庇於國際勢力而逃避納稅的義務政府倘不於此點未雨綢繆努力交涉取得把握而貿然開徵則不但托庇於國際勢力之富有者可以逃避納稅的義務而且更會促成資金的逃避了</p>

<p>（日內瓦）英外相艾登今日午後在國聯大會明白宣佈英政府對意阿爭端與其他問題之態度、謂英政府以為國聯大會無論如何、不應承認意大利佔領阿比西尼亞、蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日亦在國聯大會會議致詞、說明僅經濟制裁、不能恢復阿比西尼亞之獨立、須以更嚴重之制裁如軍事計劃等、始能達此目的、</p>

<p>艾登之演說曰、凡今日在會諸君、無一能對國聯大會召集之環境、稍具欣慰之思者、此際人人咸感覺悲痛、為國聯各會員國與國聯仍為一團體之利益計、此種事實、應予忍受、就意阿爭端中實施之制裁而論、國聯會員國已共同實施經濟與財政計劃矣、此項計劃之本身、並非未獲效果、惟衆所希望運用此項計劃之目的、未見實現、阿比西尼亞軍事與地方情勢之變化、實使吾人臻於實行之制裁不能挽回該國事變之地步、英政府如確有理由相信維持現有之制裁、甚至召增其他經濟計割、能以恢復阿比西尼亞之地位、祗須國聯其他會員國咸允實施、則英政府準備推行此種政策、惟英政府今覺絕不能抱此信念、吾人之意、唯軍事制裁始能收此效果、在月前世界狀態中、余不敢信此種軍事行動能有可能性、今不得不承認現實、月前實行之制裁賡續進行、實無所利、英政府且以為此次國聯大會無論如何、不得承認意大利之佔領阿比西尼亞、大局之現實為有急遽之變化、影響吾人對此計劃所决定之態度、則就吾人之判斷、决不能因以變更去秋國聯五十會員國對意國行動所表示之意見、</p>
<p>今尚有一至要之問題、卽國聯之前途是、吾人其應曰、吾人因此决未能制定一種法律、以制勝武力、故吾人卒須放棄此目的乎、余敢謂必不應出此言、吾人旣抱當前如此一種之目的、吾人之努力必須集中於改造之工作、惟事有甚顯明者、已往數個月所得之教訓、必須在實行中利用之、至關於國聯大會工作最近之將來、英政府隨時準備參加大會或國聯其他機關所决定應實行之任何工作、在此次集會期中、對國聯前途一問題、略作初步之交換意見、或可有益、但最要者、各國應有應分之時間與機會透澈考慮當前之問題、而延宕時日、在所難免、故余提議此問題應留待九月間國聯大會集議時討論之、英政府對於國聯所為建立之原則、仍抱信任之、外相開始演說時、曾稱揚昨日阿皇莊嚴之呼籲、</p>
<p>次李維諾夫發言稱、僅僅經濟制裁、不能迫意軍退出阿比西尼亞、而恢復阿國之獨立、此唯以更嚴重之制裁、如軍事制裁等、始能告成之、惟今必數國中之一、就其地理地位與特別關係言、允負軍事衝突之要衝、而後始能計議及此、但非其他各國担保予以相同之合作、則無人願為之也、此種担保、今急不容緩、蓋歐洲某大國之侵略意志、已使人對於其增速籌備實行侵略、毫無可疑之餘地矣、國聯盟約第十六條、明明供給國聯以有力的武器、如能充分施用、則能打破任何侵略也云、</p>
<p>加拿大駐倫敦辦事專員馬塞氏今日亦演說、謂國聯有實力之會員國、願意取必要之强制行動、以達制裁原來目的、雖出於戰爭、亦在所不惜者、顯屬寥寥無幾也、馬氏繼續追述加拿大當日首先提議制裁之情形、繼謂各國共同企圖保護一國聯會員之弱國、竟遭失敗、事之可扼腕者、孰甚於此、但加拿大此際除贊助停止進行制裁外、似無共他能實行之辦法也云、（一日路透社電）</p>

<p>藝術漫談</p>
<h3 id="c97">扇子的藝術（上） <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>戎馬倉皇的時節，也不妨分一點心來談談公子王孫搖着的扇子的藝術。</p>
<p>扇子是在中國特別發達的一種書畫形式·這又不妨視爲東洋的象徵之一。西洋人的繪畫中，取東洋風題材的，大都點綴着一把摺扇；歡喜幽默的西班牙畫家，允喜在盡中盛用扇子。這的確是一種悠閒不過的東西。生了手不必勞作，但爲自己感覺的快適而搖了扇子；甚至連搖都不必搖，但爲自己的視覺的快適而看看扇上的書畫。不是雅人的淸福麽？故西洋人歡喜取扇子來象徵東洋古風，原也有理。但畫扇的藝術，仍是東洋人的特長。我們在西洋畫中以未見過描着鉛筆晝，水彩晝，或油畫的扇子；反之，在中國畫中，扇面佔據特殊的地位。書畫家的潤例中，大都備有「扇面」一格，而且有的潤筆特別貴；裱畫店的壁上，常常黏着扇面裱成的畫軸，這種畫軸在應堂書房的裝飾中被視爲特別雅緻的一種。這是證在過去的中國，繪畫藝術特別發達，不但堂室中處處掛畫，連夏日的實用品的扇子都被劃作畫家的用武之地；因此把這實用品「藝術化」，使成爲一種脫離實用而獨立的藝術，一種「爲扇面的扇面」。又足證在過去的中國，人的生活特別悠閒，不但有功夫搖扇，又必搖描着繪畫的扇，以求身體與精神兩方的慰安，靈肉一致的快適。</p>
<p>故扇的畫法，與扇的用法，都是中國人所特長的藝術。講到畫法，因爲牠的輪廓形狀特殊，盡的布局也另有一道畫材大都宜用物象的部分——例如花的折枝，竹林的一部，懸空似的果物。或者宜用不顯示地平綫的風景——例如連綿的羣山，起伏的叢林，雲霧掩映的風景。總之，扇面上不宜顯示地平綫，因爲輪廓作弧形，地平錢從左上角通到右上角，把扇而劃分爲崎形的上下兩部，有礙美觀。中國的扇面畫中，人物畫比較的少，就因爲人物必須以房屋等爲背景，而房屋是方正的東西，容易顯出地平綫，礙於構圖的原故。山水畫比較的最多，就因爲山水隨高隨低，隨左隨右，又隨處可以設法遮掩地平錢，易於布置的原故。西洋畫中幸而沒有扇面這一格；倘使有了，西洋的盡家將爲構圖而愁殺！因爲西洋畫對於背景，同主物體一樣地注意。沒有一幅畫沒有背景。中國畫中常有全無背景而讓主物體懸空掛在一張白紙中的畫法。但照西洋畫看來，這些是未完成的作品。若敎西洋人畫，後面必須補進許多東西，或是天，或是地，務須表這主物體所亦在的地方。因此西洋畫必須有背景，必須合遠近法，卽必須有地平綫。在扇面的輪廓中，很不容易安排妥當。恐怕這也是扇面畫能在中國特殊發達的一個原因。異想天開的的，不着邊際的，圖案式的中國畫，在無論甚樣的輪廓中都能巧妙地裝得進去。這也可說是束方藝術的一種特色。</p>

<p>申報文藝專刋猪仔  黑嬰　　「為會麽不能反抗？我們就不是人麽？」　　　六拖着疼痛的身子，在薄暮的煤層路上一邊走回去，一邊咬緊牙根噴怒地說着　　「你還是這樣倔强；趙六，你忘記了我們是！」　　和他一道走着的陳福生用一種深於世故的態度向他脫，但是沒有說完，趙六粗聲地打斷了他：　　「猪仔！你說我們是猪仔！好，有一天我倒要讓那些白種人瞧瞧猪仔並不是『猪仔』；而是堂堂的『人』！」　　陳福生不再說什麽了。　　太陽已經落下了地平綫，天色灰暗下來。但是熱帶的暑氣是仍然沒有消去，趙六的脖子淌滿了汗水。他沒有穿上衣，把牠掛在手上，因此背脊上的傷痕就斑爛地呈現出來。他不會忘記那胖工頭無理的吿狀；也不會忘記那紅毛鬼子在旁邊叉起兩手，展着八字脚，命令那工頭鞭韃他！一想到這里彷彿背上纏了一條花斑蛇一般地咬得他幾乎要死；可是他把上嘴唇咬緊了下嘴唇，速一聲哎唷也不叫，心里高叫着『我要復仇』！　　那時候周圍的空氣頓然沉寂下來。幾十個猪仔們瞪着眼睛，監視着這慘劇的出演。有的胸部激得一起一伏，把拳頭揑得緊緊地；有的低下了腦袋，沒有勇氣再看下去。陳福生呢，却想到自已被賣到這里來足足五年了，過幾天他那賣身契的就可以滿期，他終於有了自由，有了回家去的日子。　　家鄕的溫暖包圍了他的心，所以一路他祗默默地走；身邊的趙六也默默地走。　　忽然又想到了什麽，陳福生說道：　　「趙六，你那脾氣得改改才好。」　　「什麽脾氣！這種非人的待遇我受得了屬？」　　「受不了也要受，有什麽法子。」那個的低聲下氣和趙六比較之下正是很好的對照，「你看我不是忍受了足足五年，才得到自由的麽？你，要是火氣放落一點，就可以少遭一頓毒打。看你的背上，血漬斑斑地…」　　「陳福生你說的什麽話！可憐我嗎？我趙六敢做敢當；可不要人家的可憐的呀！：什麽火氣放落一點，你的意思是叫我永遠做一個猪仔。老哥，我却不這麽想，林鍾生，王華他們也不這麽想，我們要反抗！我們要自由！」　　一陣冷風吹過，夜色籠罩了大地。　　夜展開着……　　被幸福的鄕夢所纏繞着的陳福生呼呼地睡去了。低矮的木柵里響着鼾聲。但是趙六是淸醒的，他的背不能躺下去，一觸着硬木板就痛。坐在那里屈起兩個膝頭，右手的肱支在膝蓋上，托着下巴，沉沉地思素着。　　靜寂中有睢在叫他：　　「趙六！趙六！」　　「是你嗎，王華？」　　他認出叫他的王華。　　那個人很快地離開了床，閃了過來；後面還跟了林鍾生和其他五六個人。　　「大家靜點！嗤！」　　「你的背還痛嗎？」有人問趙六。　　「不要管我的背…有什麽消息？」　　「聽說錫又漲價了，公司要加多出產。」材鍾生輕　地報吿着，「對於那一批契約滿期了的工人，决定不給回國的盤川；迫他們繼續做下去。」　　「有這樣的事麽？」　　「是呀，紅毛鬼秘密着呢！」　　「那末他們不能回國了？」　　這時，趙六忽然帶點酸辣地指着陳福生道：　　「那傢伙正做着回家的夢哩。」　　沉默。　　過了約莫二分鐘。　　「我們總得聯合起來對付！」　　「王華你也是滿期了的，你得做點什麽！」　　「當然！」王華堅决地回答。　　接下去聲音更小了，隔開三尺遠就完全聽不見他們說的話。大家的情緖很緊張，呼吸慢慢地加快，恍惚有什麽大難馬上要爆發似地。　　一個下着牛毛雨的早上，熱帶少有的潮濕天氣使人感到十分若悶。突然這木柵里發生了騷動，陳福生大聲地喊起來：　　「我們不能回國了！」　　即刻有許多人包圍了他；其中有許多是正在理着可憐的行李，預備上公司去領盤川的。　　「我們不能回國了！」　　這絕望的聲音傳佈開來，激動着每一個人的心。　　這時，王華却在床板上站了起來，挺起胸部，向圍在一塊的人說道：　　「是的，我們不能回國了！可是大家知道我們爲什麽不能回國？錫磯主人用賤價在香港，厦門，汕頭買來了我們，叫我們做猪仔，榨取我們的血汗，現在，契約期滿了，因爲大家，一走他就沒有人做工，買一批新的猪仔又得花一筆錢，所以才不給我們回國。你們情願永遠做一個猪仔嗎？你們不是堂堂的人嗎？好，要做『人』的話大家一道上公司去，要求紅毛鬼發給盤川，送我們回國！」　　「我們是堂堂的人！」　　「找紅毛鬼去！」　　「去！大家一齊去！」　　趙六，林鍾生他們興奮得要發在了。冒着牛毛雨，踏着堅實的脚步，一直向前走去。　　忘記了背脊上的傷痕還沒有好，趙六昂着腦袋。『我們要復仇！』心里那樣響亮地叫着。　　錫礦塲起了爭取自由的暴風雨；　　猪仔將不再永遠是猪仔了。喇叭的話  何奏　　近來我每天都聽到喇叭的聲音。這中間有吹得很熟練的老號手，你可以在房間里用手指敲着桌沿打拍子，然而也夾着有許多生手，吹得斷續不合拍子。我對於生手吹喇叭是深表同情的，其一小部原因是因爲我自己不會吹，而最重要的原因却是我親眼看過學吹喇叭的號手的那副窘相。一隻臉漲紅得像醉漢，眼睛里冒出紅絲，呆呆的凸出無神的眼珠看着前方，兩頰腫了起來，拚命掙，拚命掙！　　大槪當號手都要經過這「拚命」的階段吧？　　我記得有一决吃過晚飯，和文，保出去散步；忽地看見一個本來我們認識的小號手在練習吹喇叭，文說：「我也會，可是長久不吹了。」好吧，就去試試看。　　文拿起喇叭，我看他嘴巴一閉，屛足了氣，像一隻賭氣的蝦蝶。我撲刺笑了起來，他的屛足的氣却全跑了。　　「不能笑。」他又軍新屏氣。背向着我，把喇叭嘴套到嘴上去。　　嘟—嘟，不壞，有聲音了，然而我看他那一雙白耳朶却像一對擺在鹹肉攤上的耳朶了，而且脖子上靑筋都成了一條條蚯蚓。　　他不吹了，我們又散步，他說：「嘴巴蠻酸的。」　　因而，我對於穿着軍衣練習吹喇叭的小兵　表同情，想，我的同伴是精神十足，晚飯吃得飽飽的去吹的，竟還喊費勁；何况那些小兵！小兵們却正爲了耍吃飯才去學的呵！　　日本千家元磨曾寫過一篇散文，叫深夜的喇叭。他說：「我對於這些兵卒，畫間的疲勞還未恢復，又從渴睡的牀上被叫起來拉到野外去的兵卒，十分同情。」他聽到喇叭的要音，將他少年時代的恐怖，又明明白白在心里叫醒過來了。他心想這世界還是里暗呢。他說：「我很强烈的感到世上的寂寞的事，覺得自少年時代以至現今，在這期間里，對於世間的黑暗與孤寂，居然能够不很痛切的感着，隨便過去，似乎倒是一件不可思議的事了。」其實，這並不是「不可思議」的，其原因是在千家元磨先生並沒有做過號手，他沒有親眼看見在悲切的喇叭聲音下面多少貯滿熱血的靑年消滅下去。雖然，他畢竟還好，他並沒有獎勵過這殘酷的拿人血作賭注的不合理的戰爭，也許，他僅僅是爲了良心上一點宗敎的人道主義吧！請看他底一段話：「那喇叭令人想到生與死，現實與夢幻的境界；令人想到人們對於未來的無力；彷彿聽見消爲戰爭之露的那些亡魂的叫聲；令人想到被那風靡世界的暴力所虐的人們的運命。這使人認到分散的親子，分散的夫妻，分散的父子的殘酷的運命。」，是不是道地的和尙拜讖式的人道主義？　　事實上，要消滅戰爭也唯有以戰爭來才能消滅它！於是，號手仍是需要的，而且假如要個個人能像千家兀磨先生所希望的「得到安穩的夢」，仍是要在「安穩的夢」以前被雄偉的喇叭聲驚起若干次的。　　托爾斯泰在戰爭與和平里很淸晰地說出拿破崙的誓師詞中一句最警闢的話：「英吉利的金錢由世界底極端所招致來的俄羅斯軍隊，我們要使它蒙受着這同樣的運命。」這里値得注意的是「金錢」兩個字，金錢會使屠戶捫精神抖擻地抓牢指揮刀，叫指揮刀下的人們在「隔着生與死者的一綫」上跳舞，而這些人們也正爲了「金錢」於是不得不跳舞。托爾斯泰說：「凡事要照着你的信念去打仗，那天地間是不會有仗可打的啦！」這「信念」是什麽？它包括人道主義，然而是眞正的永久和平的人道主義，並不含有一點點宗敎意味在內。　　千家元磨先生由深夜的喇叭聲想到自己的兒子，他怕他那可愛的兒子長大起來要被徵去當兵，於是「含淚看着小孩，心里想，無論怎樣，我一定耍爲他奮鬥。」是的，我們非但要爲後來的人們奮鬥，但也必須從爲自己奮鬥起。　　阿志巴綏夫說：「在這人的精神里，所有的不外乎黑暗與荒凉，或者還有劇烈的煩惱與報復，但只剩着非人格的報復罷了。」這段話我巳記不淸是在那里讀過的了，但它却牢牢地佔據在我底記憶里，唉唉，誰說道個世界除了「黑暗」與「荒凉」，還有別的呢？　　號聲又起了，那末悲淒的不和諧的！我想起來出去看看，這喇叭是對着天的哪一邊吹的？但這些，號手們是知道的，我想。畢業生  大保　　大鐘樓，　　把時間掛在半空。　　學院裏生滿了松柏，黃槐和葡萄……　　牆壁上點綴着寄生草。　　這裏，時光永恒是逍遙的消逝。　　七樓裏是我們的書庫，　　我頓在上面頓了四個春，夏，秋，冬。　　今天我挾着講義，　　挾着文憑，　　從樓頂向地面下梯。　　什麽學問與智慧，　　什麽人生的眞諦，　　什麽柏拉圖，蘇格拉底，黑格兒……　　從今天起我永遠不再向「哲人」崇拜！　　倘使哲學家是人類的先知，　　那麼，聰明的先生，請吿訴我：　　應該向那兒去找尋飯碗？病  舒羣　　我和樓上的姑娘相識後，在我是幸福的。　　然而，我對她並沒有愛情，不僅現在沒有愛情，我想永遠也不會有的。那麽，什麼是我的幸福呢？　　自從故鄕換了新的主人，把我逐出來，去什麽地方呢？盡處都是「災亂」，終於停留在這災亂的都市裏。地方是陌生的，而且人也是陌生的，所以我整天是一個人。在孤零中，在落寞中，有個年靑靑的姑娘相識了，道不是很幸福的嗎？雖然我不是爲了愛情。　　她是中學的學生。日天到學校去，夜間跟媽媽睡在樓上；她的爸爸呢？我始終沒有見過一次。不過，我相信她是生在很幸運的家庭裏，有女僕爲她燒飯，爲她到街頭去買零碎的東西。可是，她並沒有像一般姑娘所有的驕傲。又因爲她有的是空閒，爲消磨她空閒的時間，她身子終日全被鋼琴佔有了。當她的手觸起琴音的時候，便有歌聲起來，很好聽的；而且也很動人。　　「你怎麽不常玩琴了呢」？有人這樣地問她。　　「不知道爲什麽，現在不像以前那樣喜歡玩琴了」。她說。　　我很明白，我從我跟她相識來，她被鋼琴佔有的時間大部份是屬我的了。她不肯講給媽媽的話，常常講給我聽。並且，她的信，總先給我看，有她親屬來的，有她同學來的，有她朋友來的，信是很複雜；不過，除去和她同性之外的來信，在每個字，都是潛伏着愛與熱力的。然而，那愛與熱力却裝不滿她小小的心孔，因爲她還太年輕。也就是因爲她太年輕，生活的色調，還沒有塗染她的本性，所以在她純白的心上，在她在熱的情感上，才有安放我的位置。我知道爲了自己的那種「病」；那位置在將來是要讓給別人的；雖然我不是爲了愛情。　　「去吧！馬霞」　　「不麽。你總是這樣冷待我呢？爲什麽？田春吿訴我。」　　她呌馬霞，我的名字是田春。　　因爲那種「病」時常使我躺在床上。這時候，我看她剛吃過飯的臉上留着紅暈，總是有敵意的，願意她立刻離開我。但是，她倚我的身旁不起來，她說我冷待她；是的，爲什麽？我搜索出來的解答，那是她所不能了解的。　　「你唱吧。伏爾加船曲，我學會了。好打琴給你聽」。她說。　　「我沒有力氣，再唱起來。」　　眞的，我的「病」不再給我力量唱起來；但是，她不知道我的「病」，所以她也不相信我；不過，我沒有騙她。　　她冷淡地走開。幾天沒有見到她，也沒有聽到她的琴聲；我想她到朋友的地方去了吧？　　以後我聽她媽媽說她病了，而且病得很沉重。　　不知爲什麽立刻衝動我到樓上去看她。她的眼睛在曚朧中看到我的時候，她彷彿又恢復了原有的健康，祇是臉色蒼白，很難看的。　　「你爲什麽到我這裏來呢？」　　她問我的話，我覺得是突然的。而且覺得有許多憤恨，憂傷，埋在話裏。我祗好這樣說：　　「你不是病了嗎？」　　她低低地點着頭，仍是存有憂憤的。　　「沒請人醫治嗎？」我再問。　　她的手指了窗前魚肝油的瓶子和許多藥包。　　「什麽病呢？」　　她望望她的媽媽，仍是不說話。眼睛從朦朧中陷入憂怨與傷感之間。　　「一個人躺着，總是不如到我的房間玩玩好些。」　　於是她在晚間便來了。第一句話，她是這樣問的。——　　「我來了，田春你怎麽不說呢？——馬霞，你去吧！」　　啊！她是怎樣在報復我呢。當然，我要容忍的，祗好在她的病上找些閒話講。　　「想不到你病了。」　　「病了這麽久，你今天才去看我。」　　「我也是病了」。　　「你是什麽病呢？」　　我的「病」她從來就不知道，旣使我說給她，她也不會明白，所以我給她的回答，是一個玩笑。——　　「因爲馬霞許久不來，我想她想病了。」　　她在神秘中，精神比平常更受感動；絕不會想到在一刻之前，她是個病人。我問：　　「你是什麽病呢？」　　她的唇邊幾次地要有話衝開，可是她沒說。不過誰都會看得明白，她所要說的，同我說給她的回答是一樣的；然而在她怕不是一個玩笑了吧？　　以後，我們仍是繼續着友好的關係。　　在中秋節的那天她說：　　「我的同學來了許多，等着你來，我們好合唱。」　　恰好我又病了，已經不能再起床。於是她把她整瓶的魚肝油拿來，囑咐我說：　　「你應當保養啊。一天吃一次，不要多，也不要少。」　　「難吃吧？」　　「你等等我，給你拿糖來。」　　她送糖來的時候，魚肝油己經祇剩一個空空的瓶子，她看我的嘴還在嚼着，她奇怪了。　　「你怎麽都吃了」？她問。　　「馬霞，我的病太沉重啊。」　　除此之外我還能說什麽更好些的呢？　　「請醫生吧！」　　我拒絕她。我知道我的病是很容易醫治的，祇要有食料把胃充塞起來，那病便好了。　　我的健康是她給我的。　然我對她沒有愛情，但是，誰能說我不是幸福的呢？日本通信中國僅是日本文學的課題？  雷石榆　　在現階段，中國更成爲國際上最嚴重的一環。一方面中國有了「殖民地」化的危險性，另一方面，中國智識分子爲了民族解放而勇敢地起來奮戰。這樣的中國，在文學上也是最値得注意和表現的。所以日本「文藝」六月號特闢一欄「現代日本文學的課題支那」，决不是好奇或偶然的事。但對各個執筆者的意見，我想有補充的必要。　　其中，郭沫若氏的「作爲日本文學的課題的我底母國」，說得頗痛快淋漓的，但最後一段：「把中國作爲課題之前，積蓄關於中國的體騐是第一條件。想要積蓄體騐，跨過黃海而至少有一二年的中國生活的修業是最適切的辦法。」這當然是站在進步的立塲而說的，所以用不着首先提出意識或認識等的問題。但當要積蓄體騐之前，最先非有相當的中國語言的修業不可，這也是導至深入地體騐的先决條件。但是，『若果把那相應的金圖移到實現，三四年內可從日本產生新的「水滸傳」，新的「燕子箋」吧』的這預言，决不僅限定於要「跨過黃海」，或「至少有一二年的中國生活的修業」，同時「在那期間生活的保證和作品之出版的保證」這等條件。假如深一層想，現在中國大衆過着悲慘的生活的形成是由於什麽？以及他們的口號與行動的最高目的是什麼？明顯地表現出來的時候，我想一向比中國自由的日本出版事業，也會陷於比德國更不自由的桎梏。所以在這樣的情勢下，作爲日本文學的課題而給表現的中國，至多是消極的一面，複寫巴克夫人的「縣地」，曹禺的「雷雨」等以上是頗困雞的。然而「福地」和「雷雨」離着中國積極的現實是多麽遠呢？但中國畢竟給日本作家以非常大的魅力。就中藤森成吉氏的「描寫支那！」，一開首便叙述他曾旅行歐洲的遂中經過香港時的印象。那是看見站在岸邊的一位勞働者模樣的中國老人的啣着很長而美觀的烟管在吸烟，他想走近去鑑賞，但恐對方不高興。結果意外地那位老人和藹地微笑，蹣跚然用跳舞似的撒嬌的步武走過來，而且要充分給觀察地把烟管垂向他的面前，無言地吸個他看看。他說，這小小的印象還不能忘記的。所以他感到中國人非常可親，感情的地呌道：「誰能不愛通過這可愛的中國人的姿態的中國呢？而且描寫這樣的中國看看的日本人有嗎？」　　其次是他參觀過九龍的賣淫窟。是「可驚的悲慘的巢」。　　接着又述說他的生徒郭沫若。當他任岡山高等學校的講師時，郭氏是理科一年生，那時這位生徒是不很會說日本話的。一年間因爲奔波沒有見過他，但後年聽說這寡言的靑年已當革命軍的大將，就大吃一驚了。雖說這位是年靑生徒，但年齡却和自己一樣。而且這位靑年不僅是醫學者，武漢革命軍的統率者的一人，大學的總畏，同時又是第一流詩人，小說戲曲家，中國古代研究的權威者。所以他就驚歡道：「這樣的轉變和經歷，在同年輩的日本人之間可思考的麽？」　　而且他還說，受愛好中國文學的靑年諸君的請求，早幾天寫了一篇文章給中國的雜誌。現在把他述列的一段中摘譯些出來看看吧。　　「——我愛中國及中國人。那不是所謂政治家們的滑腔或欺瞞的中日親善的精神。　　現代的中國，我以爲於作家是一大實庫。卽使採一片士壤，一滴河水，也可產生壯麗的雄篇大作。……問題在於才能和檢閱上的自由，要是沒有了後者的限制，和日本一同，中國的文藝復興期旣已開始了。」　　這樣看來，藤森氏非常把中國誇張，但這也是這位進步的名作家把對中國及中國人的自己的良心誇大。正如他說：「要是沒有了後者的限制」，「中國的文藝復興期已開始了」，但畢竟最受限制着的是後者。所以他最後這樣呌道：「羅馬一日未成之上，……的關門尙聳立，這事决不是容易的。但必要克服那一切困難的熱情，也正給要求着。中國作家自身，描寫現在眞實的國家的狀貌而給障礙着時，日本的作家敢負起那任務吧。」　　其他還有新居格的「現代支那的題材性」及山本實彥的「從上海寄給S」。後者是通信式的文章，沒有在這裏贅述的必要。但新居格氏的意見，是値得簡單地提及一下的。　　他强調農村生活的體騐，他說取材於中國的外國作品雖不少，但所描寫的不外幾個主要的都市。所以「外國作家看見的中國，槪是租界的中國，作爲漫遊者而接觸中國的都會，映在旅店窗上的中國風俗，反映於水兵或船員之眼的中國海港情調，甚至，在外國的中國街或聽說上海的生活，就作爲中國的特色而特寫似的」。於是橫光利一的「上海」，前田河廣一郞的「支那」，他也稱之爲「所謂租界小說」。因而他對谷崎澗一郎批評他譯巴克夫人的「大地」，就非常感慨地同感。「日本人呵！爲行麽不描寫中國呢？」（谷崎氏語），他接着便一段一段的引述。　　「本來我們持有和中國最密接的關係，位在東洋諸國之中，獨誇文運之盛的日本人，甚至我們的文學者們連這樣的凍西（指巴克夫人的「大地」）也讓一位出生於美國的女宣敎師之手寫出來，不楚內心可恥的嗎？」——谷崎氏語。　　但新居氏充分地說明她勝日本作家一籌的理由：她在中國出世，在中國長大，直至四十五歲的今日的她的生活，也在中國過着那大部分的。她不但中國話說得流暢，中國的古典也讀破似的。但他也並不以這樣的緣故而原諒日本的作家，倒引出種種的問題而促日本作家的反省。不過他除了人類的感情，生活的心理，社會機構下的生活關係等的理解啦，和引用胡漢民說的「爲了知道中國，一定要看看中國的農村，要是不那樣，中國的眞面目是不明白的」啦之外，也並沒或者不能指出日本作家寫不出以中國爲課題的偉大作品的客觀條件的本質的原因。同時也沒估計到目前中國的現實飛躍到離「大地」一萬八千里地，不但「大地」的作者不容易表現的階段。　　當然，我們並不以爲這樣，呌日本的作家不要描寫我們的中國，我們倒具萬分的熱誠歡迎日本的所有進步作家克服種種困難努力表現眞正的中國！　　正如前頭說過，到了現階段，中國更成爲國際上最嚴重一環。我們不但希望各國的進步作家描出「中國的動態」，更期待世界上所有弱小民族的作家，藝術家們都握起强有力的筆，揮寫東方民族解放的偉大鬥爭的序幕！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言歐陸佛化  翔　　六月一日本報海外通訊，詳述佛敎在歐洲之蔓延。歐洲信奉佛敎者蜂起，以爲「現代歐洲亟需佛敎，以解放西方羣衆之機械化的生活」，一西方之物質主義及自利主義，將使世界文化日趨滅亡，惟佛祖在天之靈，足以救之」云云。這是他們所以要信奉佛敎的理由。　　被困在資本文化之下的歐洲紳士們，在這轉變的時代，確是苦悶極了。一方面無政府生產的過度龐大的企業，在這資本主義腐爛的階段，他們感到無力控制；而一方面下層民衆，却一天天在抬起頭來，將對他們的私人產業以致命的威脅。在這苦悶的環境下。他們委實無力打破自己的束縛，爭取出路。於是他們就喊出：「機械文明滅亡了」！「世界末日將到」！等等口號。在十八十九世紀早已隨者封建政治被毀滅的基督敎，今日已乏威力可以拯救他們的靈魂，所以他們說「耶穌在德國，已行至最後一階段，此後佛敎之發展，必將日進無疑」，於是他們看到了以出世爲中心的佛敎，這確是一劑新鮮的「哥羅方」，於是他們就急不暇擇的把佛敎作爲其唯一逃生之所了。近代歐洲一部紳士們所以信奉佛敎，這是其主觀上一面的理由罷。　　可是近代佛敎在歐洲盛行，其理由决不止此，還有更大的理由，那便是引誘許多眞在痛苦中過活的平民羣衆，也跟他們鑽進這螺獅壳裏去，呌他們在這一劑新的哥羅方使用下，麻痺其神經，停止其熱血的活躍，因而可以澈底淸除了一切背叛的火星。他們明知破綻百出的耶敎，在今日已完全無力了，而佛敎却是一個新鮮玩兒呢，也許一般平民會上當吧。這才是他們要特別推重佛敎的眞正理由吧。不然的話，他們贊成出世主義，就該把一切企業財產，「棄如敝屣」，讓平民大衆來享受，平民們並無產業可以「敝屣」，平民們並不想出世，他們在火熱的生活下，正有着無窮的希望呢，爲什麽紳士們一面唱出世，一面却死覇住自己的產業不放，還要拼命「斂財」？這不是打就了圈套呌人去鑽是什麼呢！　　說「西方物質文明破產，需要東方精神文明去補救」，這已是太老了的老調。從「中學爲體，西學爲用」，到梁啟超的東西文化論，總不過是這老調的反覆。西洋鏡早已被人拆穿。居然現在還有依舊高唱這老調。我們得吿訴這些人說，西方物質文明並未破產，相反，在未來的歷史上，他將有更飛躍的發展呢。所破產者，只是幾個產業主對產業的控制能力而已。而所謂東方精神文明，却已在飛機大砲下看到其成續了，是「國破家亡」！你們是否呌我們耍更心服情願的去做奴隸呢！老牛  劉子明　　從公國裏出來，已經午夜二點鐘了。暑氣已完全消散，習習的凉風從黃浦江對面吹來，我慢慢地走着回家去。當我轉進橫馬路的時候，一個高亢的聲音在背後喊着我的名字，我站定脚向後看去，一個身材高大的年靑人從黃浦灘碼頭奔過來。因爲背着燈光，看不淸楚他的面貌，但是那個寬大的輪廓對於我是十分熟識的。我等着他走近我的面前來。那個人穿着一套和他身材不適合的汚穢西裝，面色是黑黧的，特別顯出他一對放着光彩的眼睛。他沒有站住脚，就一掌打在我的肩頭上，使我的肩頭微微感到酸痛；他却毫不在意地笑着說：　　「好久不見了，老朋友！」　　他是中學裏的同學，綽號老牛，現在他的一舉一動依舊沒有脫去那種粗野的樣子。他問了我在什麽地方做事，便問我袋裏有錢沒有。　　「要多少？」我問他。　　「不是。」他搖搖頭，「今天一天沒有吃東西，你請我吃一頓。」　　老牛和我是同住一個宿舍的，一直</p>

<p>到畢業。他喜歡運動，書桌上常常堆滿着灰塵。但是學校是特别優待運動員的，因為能夠替學校爭面子，所以老牛像其他用功的同學一樣，每年可以不擔心事升級。我是文科生，又像一個書生似的瘦弱，我們之間每一處地方都是不調和的。我們時常從細小的問題上談到讀書和運動的衝突，兩個人各自為自己的嗜好辯護，到舌疲　焦為止。但是過後仍是和好如初，而且大家退讓一步使對方滿意：他搜出書架上的書本子來，說明天起要用功讀書了；我也答應他每天分出一部分時間跟他上運動場去。不過始終不見實行的；　　到問題衝突時，雙方又爭論起來。　　到畢業那年，我們分手的晚上，在宿舍裏整夜没有安睡，那時候決不會發生衝突，我們討論的是升學和出路問題。我們的家庭狀況還能允許我們升大學，但為了各人的興趣不同，我們没有進一個大學。起初還時相過訪，漸漸地就疏遠起來。不過我知道他在大學裏還是個優秀的運動員。　　大學畢業後，踏進社會，中學時代的同學都己分手，老牛在我記憶中也己遺忘了。現在我們並着肩，默默地向前走去，各人似乎沉浸在過去的生活中，同時我覺得年輕起來，我們急於要找一個小館子談一談我們　　　情形　　　時候實在太晚了，走了很長的路，才找到了一家賣半夜點心的小吃館。我們坐定後，跑堂問我們要吃一些什麼的時候，老牛又問我了：　　「老劉，你袋裏倒底有多少錢？」　　我告訴他我袋裏的錢在這小館子裏可以做一次闊客的。他就點了許多菜，要了一壼酒。那小館子生意很清淡，除了另一角落裏有一對賣唱的夫婦外，就是我們兩個了。　　恐怕老牛真的一天没有吃東西，菜餚端上來，他便狼吞虎哄嚥地吃着，我問他的話，他或是點點頭，或是應一聲算了。我們幾年相處，大家摸熟了對方的性格，没有辦法，我祗有靜靜地等着他吃飽了肚子再講。　　對於這一筆大生意，跑堂特别殷勤，空盤子滿滿鋪上了一桌子，老牛彷彿跳高似的從座上跳起來，用手背抹抹嘴，拉着我向外就走：「吃飽了，我們走着路再談罷。」　　那時候已經三點敲過了，我問他現在住在那裏。　　「那種事體談他做甚？」老牛很隨便地回答着：「大學畢業了没有找到過事。上月伯父　我到一個寫字間去，我坐不滿兩天就逃了出來。父親不知道洋鬼子那種嘴臉，說我永世找不到事做，把我臭罵一頓。我氣極了，從家裏出來，找不到事永不回去——」　　老牛一口氣說着，連連用自己的拳頭打着另一個手掌，彷彿藉此消那一口氣似的。　　「那末，現在住在那裏呢？」我問他。　　「這個你不用管他。有錢借我十塊，有了馬上還你。」　　「這樣，給我一個通訊地址吧。」　　他摇着頭接了鈔票，向原來的路上走去。走了幾步，舉起他的粗大的手掌來對我說：　　「過一星期我到你家裏來，一定不失約，我有件事情要託你。」　　老牛說着，帶跑帶跳的走了，我目送那個高大的身體在路角消逝。播音節目特别節目　　夜月歌劇社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午四時至五時　　夜月歌　（前奏）　　春之花　（張燕）　　鐵蹄下的歌女　（王玲）　　從軍别愛　（新人）　　擱樓上的小組　（王玲）　　飄泊者　（新人）　　永别了弟弟　（張燕）　　決鬥　（赫爾）　　畢業歌　（全體）　　琍琍聲樂社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　消逝調　（純美）　　打長江　（孫英）　　王女士的鷄　（琍利）　　夢中逮别　（純美）　　悲秋　（孫英）　　永别了我的弟弟　（琍琍）　　人面桃花　（琍琍）　　蝠影樂團國樂　　交部（一三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　一兒裴曲　二旱天雷　　　三後滿庭芳　四柳腰金　　　五三潭花月　　檀島樂社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午七時半至八時　　良夜情曲　（全體）　　在Waikiki海濱　（唐·蒂蒂·大衛）　　可愛的姑娘　（愛侖唱愛蒂伴奏）　　婆愛媽　（玲小姐唱狄客手風琴）　　旋律攀　（安痕小組唱愛蒂伴奏）　　南海的姑娘　（一凡·蒂蒂·小衛）　　千謝萬謝　（玲小姐唱愛蒂伴奏）　　遠隔重洋夏威夷　（唐·蒂蒂·哈萊）　　天上仙樂　（安痕小組唱愛蒂伴奏）　　離别曲　（全體）彈詞　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「花月聯珠」　　春江花月最繁華。月映花牆花月偕。花愛月明花愛月。月移花影月移花。花開待月琴停響。月裏催花鼓亂撾。滿地落花金萬字。一鉤新月玉丫叉。花花世界春常在。月月潮頭信不差。皓月一輪修玉斧。梅花三弄　銅　。江郎夢繞生花筆。張子游仙泛月槎。面似桃花眉如月。水中明月鏡中花。好憑月老傳鴛牒。為情花奴拾鳳釵。拜月焚香情正切。葬花　玉恨無涯。荻花秋月潯陽客。孤月梅花處士家。月殿掃興　　帶。花階立月鳳頭鞋。水中撈月空成話。霧裏看花興自佳。桅月懷人悲月榭。簪花及第步大　。素娥　月宮中住。玉女菱花鏡裏揩。欲　珠簾　夜月。為　恶竹灌名花。落花啼鳥春愁水。斜月殘燈夜夢賒。月裏種花防雨妬。花間漏月為雲遮。花叢酌酒遊蜂舞。月　吹簫引鳳諧。月作　　花作枕。花為叫　月為家。天花亂　迷花影。秋月常圓看月華。冷月殘風　寂寞。　花敗柳路橫斜。白雲萬甲關山月。　血千年帝子花。有月無花真少趣。有花無月靜無　。從今後。花最又夕送年華。歌唱　　風雲音樂歌唱社　　大中華（一一六〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　城市之光　（蕊英）　　新鳳求凰　（張莉）　　等一等吧　（馬太）（莉莉）　　賣油條　（雪霞）　　浮雲掩月　（蕊英）　　小小茉莉　（張莉）　　芙蓉團　　李樹德（九四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　寄給父親的詩　（雪雪）　　摩登變愛　（雪敏）　　雙摇舟　（文元）（雪露）　　紅豆新詩　（雪琦）　　同樂（七二〇）下午十時三刻至十一時半　　航空救國　（雪雪）　　紫羅蘭　（雪露）　　鴛鴦怨　（雪敏）　　說愛就愛　（文元）（雪露）　　示愛秘訣　（雪琦）　　上海市（九〇〇）每日節目　　上午　　一一·四五西樂　　Tanuhauser-Grand　March　The　Battle　of　Waterioo·　　一二·〇〇報時　氣象　新聞　西樂　　Dance　of　The　Mationctt　Polichnelle　Serena　e　In　A　Persian　Market,In　a　Chinese　Lemple　Gard　n　Acadcmic　Fest　　　l　Over　ture祝婚進行曲　　下午　　一·三〇　演講（衛生局）　　二·〇〇　休息　　四·一五　國劇研究（蘇少卿先生）　　五·〇〇　兒童教育節目　　五·三〇　大鼓（長坂坡趙雲截江，哭祖廟，林黛玉焚稿，華容道。）　　六·〇〇　市政報告（教育局周召南先生）　　六·三〇　氣象　新聞　國樂（傍粧台，　鴣飛，朝元歌，水龍吟寒鴉戲水，搗衣曲）　　七·〇〇　革命歷史（市黨部蔡洪田先生）　　七·三〇　平劇（捉放宿店，西料，　街亭，烏龍院，六月雪，洪羊洞，珠簾寨）　　八·〇〇　轉播中央廣播電台節目　　八，〇〇　報時　氣象　簡明新聞　　八，一〇　新生活運動促進會宣傳節目　　八，二〇　音樂　　八，三五　音樂叢談　　九·〇五　預報明日節目　平劇　　九·一五　停止最新節目　　交通　（一三〇〇）　　八時半　農產物行情（星期一至六）　　九時　　關鐘報時新聞氣象唱片　　（仝上）貴州苗民生活鱗爪  高卓　　（一）被遺亡了的民族　　苗民，是僻居在廣西雲南貴州諸省的一種族。他們的經濟很幼稚，大都在封建生產方式之下營着自給自足的生活；没有獨立的政治組織，換一句話，苗民没有建立自己的政權而是隸屬於漢人的政治機構下；苗民自有其文化，但不能發達，而且是正在部分同化於漢族部分消滅的過程中：苗民是一個「早枯」的種族，我們從它的日見其減少的人口上可以斷定它的前途。然而，關於苗民的諸種問題，從未見有人重視過，這使我們對於這個日趨消滅的種族更加其惋惜；可是，我在這個地方，不想扳起面孔來談苗民問題，擬劃一些關於苗族的經濟政治文化的建設與發展的方案，祗想就我的故鄉——貴州——的苗民的生活習慣風俗人情，採取一些新穎的材料，描繪出來，使讀者看見這不幸的種族是多麼可愛。　　（二）服裝　　苗民的服裝複雜，一如他們的分族，——大抵每一族在服裝上都有一種特殊的表記——但在大體上還能一致。短的大襟布衣和赤足着草履，是苗民男女一致的服裝；但女人總比較喜歡修飾，茶杯口大小的耳環，五寸來　的繡花的衣邊，插在髻上的刺猬的箭，都是她們的裝飾品。她們的腰間圍上一條軟而多縐的短裙，高懸在膝上，下面踝露出健康的小腿，是極健步的。她們走路能夠與男子一樣快，而肥大的臀部掀動着那軟而多縐的裙，使它圓轉地在四週擺動，自成一種天然的風度。——可是，苗女是不着褲的，她們如需排洩時，只須往地下一蹲便成。　　有一部分苗女很美，雖整日在烈日下，但從不減褪她們的面孔白嫩與紅艶；但她們容易老，一近三十歲，她們的美麗便消失了，面孔變得黑而多紋，成了一個十足的老太婆。　　男性的苗民是更其健壯了。粗大的聲音，黝黑的面孔，雖稍近野巒，但從其堅實的體態，絕不能看出這是一個孱弱的種族。　　春天，野菜叢生在山間田間，這便是苗女們向漢人的城市出動的時候了。她們先去採取野菜，實在竹製的背筐裏，成羣地到漢人的城市來賣。而秋天，她們却貢獻漢人以金黄色的茨梨與深紅色的山楂。在春天，貴陽—貴州省城—的街市上到處都有女性呌着「賣……斑鳩窩，地星宿」的聲音，而秋天呢，却有呌着「賣……山楂茨梨」的聲音，這便是苗女們在街上呌賣。</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Although Southwest troops are still concentrating, the situation in southern Hunan appears to be gradually easing. It is widely believed that war is unlikely to break out before the Nanjing Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee convenes on July 10th. Both sides are still seeking solutions through peaceful means. In this regard, a local Chinese evening newspaper reported that Central Executive Committee member Wang Chonghui will arrive in the south on July 7th. Meanwhile, the Guangdong authorities have issued an order prohibiting the export of grain. It is widely believed that the authorities are taking this measure to curb the continued rise in rice prices and prevent potential food shortages in the event of a serious situation. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Changsha, southern Hunan remains very quiet. No Guangxi troops have been seen in Hengzhou, Qiyang, or Baoqing. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Local authorities have firmly denied rumors that Guangxi troops have resumed their advance into southern Hunan or that conflicts have occurred with Central Army or Hunan Army forces. They stated that Southwest leaders are sincerely awaiting the outcome of the Nanjing Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on July 10th and will temporarily refrain from any further military action. The fact that trains on the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are running as usual without interruption is proof that southern Hunan is indeed very peaceful. Furthermore, all provincial highways are currently open to traffic as usual. According to travelers arriving here via Hunan Province, the railway lines are very quiet, they have not heard of any battles, and have not seen any wounded soldiers. The peaceful atmosphere in the countryside is especially moving. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Guangxi adopted a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, expanding its military operations to the Guizhou border. A telegram from Hunan stated that two divisions of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi's army have invaded Duyun in Guizhou Province. It is rumored that they are using the Guizhou bandit Cao Tianquan to cause disturbances in the Guangxi-Guizhou border region, with the intention of seizing Guiyang. The situation in southern and western Hunan remains uncertain. Bai has repeatedly gone to the front to make arrangements, but his intentions are unclear. It is difficult to confirm whether conflicts will continue. People in Wuhan remain worried. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) A dispatch from Yongding stated that a unit of Guangdong troops recently arrived in Xiayang Township, 50 li from the county seat in the fifth district.

(Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to travelers arriving here via Hunan Province from Central China, they did not see any battles in Hunan Province. Trains are still running to Pingshi, where Guangdong troops are currently concentrating. A hundred students from Guangxi lined up today to appeal to the Southwest Political Committee Headquarters for the immediate dispatch of anti-Japanese troops. These students are all from Nanning, and most of them are under the age of fourteen. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Conflict Continues Between Militia and Local Forces in Yutian Civil Uprising <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) A civil uprising occurred in Yutian County. The reason is that the Yutian militia has always been extremely powerful, and all their firearms are self-supplied. Now, as the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Government intends to reorganize them and place them under the police department, the militia fears that their weapons will be confiscated, so they have risen up in resistance. On the evening of the 30th of last month, the militia attacked the county seat. The security team and county police in the city opened fire to suppress them, resulting in casualties on both sides. Conflicts continued on the 1st. Today, the militia is still gathering outside the city, and the police are on guard in the four districts. The two sides are still deadlocked. The Eastern Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Government has dispatched a unit of the Second Security Corps to provide support. According to Japanese sources, the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Government has decided to send Chi Zongmo to Japan early next month to visit the Japanese government.

<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, arrived at Xiaguan at 11:00 AM on the 2nd. He shook hands and expressed his gratitude to Liu Naifan, section chief of the National Government, Lin Tongshi, chief of the External Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wei Changgeng, the mayor's representative, on the Kumano warship.

Kawagoe's wife, Councilor Arino, Naval Attache Sato, and others, who arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai the night before, arrived on the morning of the 2nd. After disembarking, he went to the embassy's Nanjing office for lunch. At 5:00 PM, Kawagoe, accompanied by Arino, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an initial courtesy call. They exchanged brief greetings and admiration. The conversation was short. He is scheduled to present his credentials at 11:30 AM on the morning of the 3rd. At noon, the Chairman will host a banquet at the National Government, inviting committee members from various departments and ministers to accompany him. In the evening, the Foreign Minister will host a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, inviting chairmen of various departments and committees to accompany him. Kawagoe, wearing a gray woolen casual suit and black leather shoes, is 56 years old.

Kawagoe met with Chinese and foreign reporters who visited him at 4:30 PM and briefly touched on various issues, stating in essence that he believes that promoting economic cooperation between China and Japan is the most important task at present and is what he hopes to achieve. He believes that economic cooperation in North China is particularly important. As for the Daiei Maru incident, he expressed hope that it will be resolved locally. Kawagoe said that the Three Principles of Hirota have not been abandoned, but due to the passage of time and changes in the situation, some of them may not be suitable for the current situation. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 5:00 PM on the 2nd, Ambassador Kawagoe, accompanied by Consul-General Suma, Secretaries Mutō and Arino, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After exchanging greetings, they had a cordial conversation until 5:30 PM, when they returned to the official residence. Ambassador Kawagoe said that he planned to stay for a week to exchange views with the Chinese side, but due to the meeting, it might be possible to slightly extend the length of stay, it is also possible, and if there is an opportunity, he intends to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. The overall direction of Japan's policy towards China is of course based on the Three Principles, and there are many other requirements. He believes that the Chinese side also has suggestions for Japan, so he intends to gradually conduct talks on this point. He believes in the necessity and possibility of economic cooperation and will focus on this aspect in the future. As for the development of China's economy, it is best to start with transportation infrastructure, with the improvement of railways being particularly necessary. The issue of customs surveillance ships opening fire is being negotiated by Consul-General Suma in Nanjing. The Shanghai side and the Inspector General of Customs are also in negotiations, so he does not intend to protest to the National Government about this issue and hopes that it will be resolved locally. Furthermore, the problem of smuggling is a problem that China itself should solve, so even if Japan comes forward to deal with it, it can only cooperate. The underlying causes of high tariffs and other issues must be resolved. Also, he does not know the details of the Sino-German loan, so he cannot express his opinion. (Domei News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Issue of Income Tax Collection <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Recently, the income tax, which is scheduled to be implemented, is the most interesting aspect of tax system reform that we are concerned about.</p>
<p>A sound tax system in a country should be based on direct taxes and supplemented by indirect taxes. China's largest source of tax revenue is tariffs, followed by salt tax, and then consolidated tax. Although these three sources of tax revenue account for the majority of the annual fiscal revenue, they are all indirect taxes, which are not only unevenly distributed but also have little flexibility and cannot be adjusted at any time to the state treasury's revenue and expenditure, which is very inconvenient. In peacetime, it may still be able to support it with effort, but if an accident occurs, tax revenue will inevitably be short, and expenditure will be difficult to meet. Therefore, China's tax system urgently needs to gradually shift to direct taxes as the main source of tax revenue. The most important of direct taxes is the income tax. Now, the financial authorities have drafted an income tax law and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for transmission to the Central Political Committee for approval and delivery to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The national general budget for the Republic of China in 1936, which was recently passed by the Legislative Yuan, has also included income tax in the revenue item. The date of collection should not be far off.</p>
<p>The greatest advantages of income tax are four: First, the burden is fair. The ability of citizens to pay taxes varies according to wealth. Income tax is based on the ability principle and uses progressive tax rates to appropriately increase the obligations of the wealthy, which can compensate for the defects of proportional tax. Second, tax payment is universal. Ordinary taxes are mostly levied on a part of the population, while income tax requires all citizens above the tax standard to bear the obligation to pay taxes according to the size of their income. Third, the income is stable. There is reliable income for collecting income tax in a certain period. Fourth, it is rich in flexibility. Generally, taxes are not easy to change tax rates at any time. The targets of income tax collection are all middle-class people or above. In peacetime, the tax rate can be lowered to increase their wealth. When necessary, slightly raising the tax rate can make it easier for the government to raise emergency funds. Income tax has become the main part of the tax revenue of various advanced countries because of these four advantages.</p>
<p>Since income tax is a good tax and it is still in its initial stage in our country, it should be handled with caution in order to achieve success. The following two major premises are hoped that the authorities will pay special attention to before the start of collection:</p>
<p>First, the tax law should be as detailed as possible and the tax rate should be as low as possible. From the perspective of the wealthy, do not urge them to escape urgently. From the perspective of the poor, do not make them suffer from the burden. At the beginning of the collection, only seek fairness and ease of burden, and gradually cultivate the habit of paying taxes. Second, before the collection of income tax, there must be diplomatic efforts to seek international understanding and assistance. Because the existence of concessions and foreign banks in Wuhu can enable the wealthy to rely on international forces to escape the obligation to pay taxes. If the government does not plan ahead on this point, strive to negotiate and gain assurance, and rashly start collection, then not only will the wealthy who rely on international forces be able to escape the obligation to pay taxes, but it will also promote the escape of funds.</p>

<p>(Peiping) The trial of the case in which British soldiers Kirk and Hunter are accused of beating to death Japanese officer Sasaki and injuring another Japanese citizen has now reached its final stage. When the court opened this morning, several witnesses were called again to testify. According to two of them, they saw two British soldiers heading to the British Army Club around 12:30 AM on the night of May 26th (the place is about 200 yards from where Sasaki's body was found). The last witness was a Korean waitress serving at the "No. 27" wine shed, which is where the other Japanese citizen, Onishi, was beaten. According to the waitress, she still remembered hearing shouts on the night of May 26th and saw Kirk and Hunter enter the "No. 27" courtyard, and then enter a waitress's room. Onishi was beaten in the room. She closed the door and did not dare to go out to see, only hearing the sound of quarreling in the next room. Afterwards, she saw a Japanese guest with blood flowing from his eyebrows and mouth. She then entered the next room and saw blood stains on the floor. The witness also identified Kirk and Hunter among the British soldiers standing in the court as the ones who had entered the courtyard of the "No. 27" wine shed that night (she only pointed out Kirk during the identification at the British Embassy). After the prosecution concluded, the judge announced that he would review the testimonies of the witnesses before making a decision and scheduled the court to continue at 10:30 AM tomorrow morning.

<p>(Nanjing) To celebrate President Jiang's 50th birthday this year, central government agencies and provincial and municipal authorities, as well as military commanders and civilian groups, have initiated fundraising to purchase airplanes to be presented to the government as a memorial.

<p>(Geneva) The eight Italian newspaper reporters arrested last night for obstructing Prince Umberto's attendance at the League of Nations Assembly will not be allowed to remain in Geneva during the conference. According to Swiss law, they should be severely punished for insulting foreign special representatives, or face imprisonment. However, the Swiss Federal Government has decided not to prosecute them. The Swiss authorities ordered the arrested individuals to be released from prison tonight and escorted to the Italian border tomorrow. However, the Italian Minister to Switzerland has protested, requesting that the reporters be given a reasonable period to arrange everything before being expelled, and that they be escorted to the nearest point to the Italian border. It is speculated that the eight reporters will go to Coppet to submit reports to the Italian authorities, as it is a small lakeside village ten miles from Geneva. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

Furthermore, countries advocating for the maintenance of European peace have formed a united front, which is also a welcome phenomenon. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Léon Blum recently made a statement to the press, saying, "Before I came to Geneva, I was deeply concerned that many countries would express indifference due to the setbacks suffered by the League of Nations in handling the Italo-Ethiopian dispute.

<p>(Geneva) Delegations from various countries at the League of Nations Assembly are currently preparing a draft resolution to conclude the debate. This draft resolution, originally proposed by the French delegation, will be revised at the last minute before being submitted to the Assembly, taking into account the views of all parties to obtain the support of the majority. Its contents are likely to include two items: 1. Reaffirmation of the principles contained in Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (Note: Article 10 of the Covenant concerns respecting the territorial integrity of member states, and Article 16 concerns sanctions measures); 2. Proposal to organize a committee to discuss the situation in East Africa before the regular meeting in September, as well as the note submitted by the Italian government on the 29th of last month. Furthermore, the issue of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will also be discussed. French Foreign Minister Delbos spent half a month drafting a speech, which he will present to the Assembly on Friday to explain how the French government intends to amend the League of Nations Covenant to strengthen the League's authority.

<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Eden clearly announced the British government's attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and other issues at the League of Nations Assembly this afternoon, stating that the British government believes that the League of Nations Assembly should not recognize Italy's occupation of Abyssinia under any circumstances. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also addressed the League of Nations Assembly today, explaining that economic sanctions alone cannot restore Abyssinia's independence, and more severe sanctions, such as military plans, are needed to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3 id="e48">League of Nations Assembly Session: British Foreign Secretary's Speech <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<h3 id="e49">Continuing Sanctions Are Truly Useless; Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia Should Not Be Recognized; League of Nations Reform to Be Discussed in September <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Eden's speech stated: "None of you here today can have any sense of satisfaction regarding the circumstances of the League of Nations Assembly's convocation. At this moment, everyone feels grief. For the sake of the interests of all member states of the League of Nations and the League of Nations as a whole, this fact should be endured. Regarding the sanctions implemented in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, member states of the League of Nations have jointly implemented economic and financial plans. This plan itself has not been without effect; however, the purpose for which it was hoped to be used has not been realized. The changes in the military and local situation in Abyssinia have made us reach a point where the implemented sanctions cannot reverse the situation in that country. If the British government has reason to believe that maintaining existing sanctions, or even adding other economic measures, could restore Abyssinia's position, and if other member states of the League of Nations are willing to implement them, then the British government is prepared to pursue this policy. However, the British government now feels that it absolutely cannot hold this belief. In our opinion, only military sanctions could achieve this effect. In the world situation of a month ago, I dared not believe that such military action was possible. Now, we must acknowledge reality. Continuing the sanctions implemented a month ago is truly useless. The British government also believes that this League of Nations Assembly, under no circumstances, should recognize Italy's occupation of Abyssinia. The reality of the overall situation is undergoing rapid changes, affecting our attitude towards the decisions made regarding this plan. In our judgment, this cannot change the opinion expressed by fifty member states of the League of Nations last autumn regarding Italy's actions."</p>
<p>"There is still a crucial question, which is the future of the League of Nations. Should we say that because we ultimately failed to create a law to overcome force, we must abandon this goal? I dare say we should not say this. Since we hold such a goal at present, our efforts must be focused on the work of reform. However, it is very clear that the lessons learned in the past few months must be utilized in practice. As for the immediate future of the League of Nations Assembly's work, the British government is ready at any time to participate in any work that the Assembly or other organs of the League of Nations decide to implement. During this gathering, it may be beneficial to exchange preliminary views on the question of the future of the League of Nations. But most importantly, each country should have the necessary time and opportunity to thoroughly consider the current issues, and delays are unavoidable. Therefore, I propose that this issue be left for discussion at the League of Nations Assembly meeting in September. The British government still believes in the principles for which the League of Nations was established." The Foreign Secretary, at the beginning of his speech, praised the solemn appeal of the Abyssinian Emperor yesterday.</p>
<p>Next, Litvinov spoke, saying that economic sanctions alone cannot force the Italian army to withdraw from Abyssinia and restore Abyssinia's independence. This can only be achieved with more severe sanctions, such as military sanctions. However, it is now necessary for one of several countries, in terms of its geographical location and special relationship, to assume the crucial role of military conflict before this can be discussed. But no one is willing to do so without a guarantee from other countries to provide the same cooperation. This guarantee is urgently needed now, because the aggressive will of a certain major European power has left no doubt that it is accelerating preparations to carry out aggression. Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly provides the League of Nations with powerful weapons. If they can be fully utilized, they can defeat any aggression."</p>
<p>Mr. Massey, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, also spoke today, saying that there are very few member states of the League of Nations with the strength who are willing to take necessary coercive action, even if it results in war, to achieve the original purpose of sanctions. Mr. Massey continued to recount the circumstances under which Canada first proposed sanctions, and then said that the joint attempt by various countries to protect a weak member state of the League of Nations has failed. What could be more regrettable than this? However, at this moment, Canada seems to have no other practical way to proceed except to support the cessation of sanctions. (Reuter's report from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 4:00 PM today. The first speaker was De Wet, the representative of the Union of South Africa, who advocated maintaining the current sanctions. So far, the Union of South Africa is the first among the member states of the League of Nations to make this claim. De Wet said, "The League of Nations Assembly passed a resolution on October 10th of last year, taking collective action against Italy. At that time, all member states expressed their agreement. Our government believes that this collective action is the only effective tool for maintaining security. I hereby advocate that it should be maintained at this moment, as it is the only way to protect the nations of all countries." He then said, "The League of Nations has suffered a great loss of reputation because of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. This does not mean that the League of Nations has failed, but rather that human beings lack the ability to fulfill their obligations." The Canadian representative, Massey, then spoke, saying that the responsibility for the Italo-Abyssinian war is clear, but at this moment, there is no other way to follow except to abolish the sanctions. In short, we have exhausted our wisdom and efforts to ensure that small member states are not subjected to aggression. This attempt has now failed."</p>
<p>By 6:30 PM, the chairman, Belgian Prime Minister Janson, announced the adjournment of the meeting, saying that there were still representatives from fifteen countries who had registered to speak, and that the work of the Assembly could be concluded this Friday. (Havas report from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations Assembly meeting this morning, Australian representative Bruce gave a speech, stating that the Australian government now feels that sanctions against Italy are of no benefit. Bruce said that the Australian government, in view of all the facts, believes that in the case of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the purpose of sanctions has become ineffective and should be abolished. If they continue to be implemented now, they will cause disaster for the League of Nations. Since they cannot be maintained, they will inevitably succumb in a few months. Announcing their ineffectiveness today is a fair way to treat Abyssinia. Bruce also asked, "Isn't it enough that sanctions have misled the unfortunate Abyssinia?" (Reuter's report from the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Hitler's reply to the British inquiry has actually been completed. Although it has not been published, it is reported that its contents include the following points: Reiteration of the common security of Western Europe; the difficulties in the implementation of the non-aggression pact system proposed by Germany; Germany, in view of the erratic nature of British foreign policy and its proposals to reform the League of Nations, which are difficult to grasp, is reluctant to be bound. The German newspapers are now expressing anxiety about Britain's foreign policy, and are uneasy about British Secretary of War Cooper's recent speech in Paris. The Frankfurter Zeitung published an article commenting on the overall situation, asking whether Britain always wants to obtain a three-way solution, or whether it wants to form an Anglo-French armed camp and invite Germany to join. (Reuter's report from the 1st)</p>
<p>(London) British, French, and Belgian cabinet members discussed the future meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact in Geneva yesterday. It is expected to be held in Brussels, Belgium, in the second half of this month. According to semi-official sources here, the British government will accept this proposal. The government also hopes that Italy can participate at that time, so that the discussion can be more practical than before. As for the main issues to be discussed at the meeting, in addition to the Rhine issue, there are three other items: the issue of Germany's continued demand for colonies; Germany's attitude towards the Free City of Danzig; Germany's attitude towards Austria. If the German government has already submitted a reply to the British questions, it will naturally be submitted for study. Otherwise, it will be necessary to formulate necessary measures to conclude the matter and put it into practice. Regarding this matter, it is reported that the British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, has submitted a report to the government, stating that Hitler's confidant, Ribbentrop, recently gave a speech to the Berlin press, and his tone implied that he did not intend to reply to the British questions. Ribbentrop also said that if Germany cannot obtain colonies one day, then it cannot be regarded as having achieved the goal of equal rights in Europe. According to the British question, it asked Germany how it interprets the term "equal rights" and how it can be considered satisfied. Now, pondering what Ribbentrop said can at least be regarded as an indirect answer to this question of Britain. (Havas report from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Extraordinary Meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, after convening on the 26th of last month, immediately announced its adjournment. It is now scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting at 6:30 PM today to discuss the issue of the Free City of Danzig, which is included on the agenda of this meeting. It is reported that the leader of the Nazi Party branch in the city, Forster, recently published an article criticizing the High Commissioner of the League of Nations, Lester, and advocated abolishing the post of High Commissioner. Lester came here the day before yesterday and met with the Chairman of the Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, this morning.

<p>(London) Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia, has returned home from his post and has arrived in Ramsgate, Kent. He recently gave a speech to local journalists, stating that the rumors that the British Embassy in Abyssinia will be closed are untrue. During his absence, all embassy affairs will be temporarily handled by First Secretary Roberts. When asked by reporters about the current situation in Abyssinia, Barton replied, "In a word, no one knows. As for the future of Abyssinia, it can only be resolved in Europe. The land occupied by the Italian army is only a part of Abyssinia. The entire Abyssinia has neither surrendered to the Italian army nor has it been completely occupied. The so-called current situation is not yet a problem." (Havas report from the 2nd)</p>

He also said that within Abyssinia, only Harar in the central region and Gore in the western region still have British consulates. The British Consulate in Gore is in contact with the Abyssinian authorities. The government does not intend to make any changes to these consulates at present. (Havas report from the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Personnel from the French delegation recently stated that the railway from Djibouti in French Somaliland to Addis Ababa, which is operated by the French, has received instructions from the French government that the company authorities have always refused to transport Italian troops and military supplies through Djibouti to the interior of Abyssinia, and it is still not allowed. As for other supplies needed by the Italian army, although they can be transported, they must be done in accordance with ordinary commercial transportation methods. As for the Rome Agreement signed between France and Italy on January 7, 1935, its main purpose was to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries in Africa. Regarding Abyssinia, all of France's economic interests have been recognized by the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian Treaty. The Rome Agreement only reiterates this. This does not mean that France recognizes that Italy enjoys political rights in Abyssinia. Moreover, since France is a member state of the League of Nations, any action by Italy that would hinder Abyssinia's political independence and territorial integrity is naturally not something that France can agree to. It is reported that the Emperor of Abyssinia made a speech at the League of Nations Fire Conference yesterday, criticizing the French railway for allowing Italian troops to use it, so the French delegation issued this statement to clarify it.

<h3 id="e55">Baldwin Returns to Capital and Re-enters the House of Commons: Members Cheer for Two Minutes <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin recently had a busy schedule and was overworked. He had been resting in Chequers for a few days. Today, when he re-entered the House of Commons, the members cheered for two minutes. Recently, some newspapers have published rumors that the Prime Minister's health is failing and that he may resign. Therefore, today, when the people saw the Prime Minister's healthy arrival, they were even more excited. Labor Party member Johnstone raised a question about the recent speech made by former Secretary of State for Air, Lord Londonderry. The Prime Minister replied that his statement that he had mistakenly believed people regarding the speed of Germany's aerial armaments was not intended to criticize any department or individual. It is often difficult for a country that does not publish defense budgets to obtain accurate information. The government is very satisfied with the current information it has obtained about Germany's aerial strength, because this information comes from all sides. According to the accurate information that can be obtained, it is close to the actual situation. (Reuter's report from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Former Secretary of State for Air, Lord Londonderry, gave a speech in Newcastle on the 26th of last month, stating that when he was in office, all information regarding Germany's expansion of its air force was reported to Prime Minister Baldwin without any omissions. This speech was used to respond to the Prime Minister's accusations (Prime Minister Baldwin gave a speech last winter, saying that the reports he received regarding the expansion of the German air force were not entirely accurate) and has attracted the attention of the opposition. At a meeting of the House of Commons today, opposition Labor Party member Johnston also raised a question. Prime Minister Baldwin, who had been resting in Chequers, returned to the capital this morning in order to attend the House of Commons and provide a response. At that time, he will also give an important speech to defend the cabinet and its policies. He will inevitably address the issues of domestic and foreign affairs one by one. In addition, when the Prime Minister was resting in Chequers, he consulted his friends and the main members of the cabinet on the issue of his personal position. (Havas report from the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Mechanization of Soviet Agriculture: Farmers Mostly Use Combine Harvesters <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(TASS Moscow, June 4) A year ago, only one-fifth of the grain planting area in the Melitopol District of Ukraine used combine harvesters. This year, all the grain in the district is harvested with combine harvesters. This is one example of the mechanization of agriculture throughout the Soviet Union. The grain harvest in southern Soviet Union will soon begin, and the other parts will follow soon. This year, one-quarter of all grain in the Soviet Union will be harvested with combine harvesters. This year, 61,000 new combine harvesters will be added, greatly increasing its power. The significance of combine harvesters in agriculture is not only that they can speed up the harvest (which is of great significance in agriculture), but also that they can reduce grain loss during harvest. This sometimes increases the harvest by 20% to 25%. Therefore, the increase in grain income this year due to combine harvesters will reach millions of tons. Although the widespread use of combine harvesters in the Soviet Union is difficult to achieve overnight, it is also developing significantly year by year. As the number of combine harvesters increases year by year, the training of combine harvester drivers also improves year by year. This year, combine harvester drivers have a particularly serious task. Last year, the Stakhanovite movement showed that combine harvesters had not been fully utilized. Therefore, this year, the best drivers will increase the work efficiency of combine harvesters by two, three, or four times. This year, the level of work of combine harvesters has also greatly increased.</p>

<h3 id="e60">US Finances: Shortfall of 44 Billion Yuan, the Largest Peacetime Government Spending Shortfall; Fortunately, Revenue Is Gradually Increasing and Expenditures Are Also Decreasing <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government's fiscal year has recently ended, and its government spending shortfall has reached 4,400,000,000 yuan. This is the largest government spending shortfall in the US during peacetime. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau gave a radio address to the nation today, announcing this number and saying that public debt now totals 33,750,000,000 yuan. This year's revenue was 4,116,000,000 yuan, and expenditures were 8,500,000,000 yuan, excluding debt repayment. If the funds required for veterans' pensions are not included, the shortfall will be reduced to 2,700,000,000 yuan. The budget plan set about two years ago was destroyed by unforeseen events. The passage of the veterans' pension bill increased government spending by 1,700,000,000 yuan. The government borrowed more than 5,000,000,000 yuan this year, but there is still 2,700,000,000 yuan in cash to cover expenses next month. The government also has important cash assets in the $2,000,000,000 US dollar exchange rate stabilization fund, which will eventually be used to repay the same amount of public debt. (Reuter's report from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau gave a radio address to the nation tonight, reporting on the state of the fiscal year, saying that the US government's revenue has increased, and expenditures have decreased. The national economy is thriving. He cited statistics to explain that the federal government's budget deficit and the increase in public debt were purely due to relief spending and veterans' benefits. In addition, the agricultural adjustment tax was deemed illegal, resulting in a large loss of revenue. Mr. Morgenthau continued, "Total government spending was 8,500,000,000 yuan, excluding the amount of public debt repayment. Actual revenue was 4,116,000,000 yuan, with a difference between revenue and expenditure of 4,400,000,000 yuan. Since the agricultural adjustment tax was ruled illegal, the Ministry of Finance lost 500,000,000 yuan in tax revenue, but income tax has increased by 30%, other miscellaneous taxes have increased by 20%, and tariffs have also increased by 12%. National administrative expenses totaled 3,500,000,000 yuan, of which 75,000,000 yuan was for national defense, 600,000,000 yuan was for veterans' permanent benefits, 750,000,000 yuan was for public debt interest, 500,000,000 yuan was for agricultural subsidies, and 900,000,000 yuan was for other miscellaneous expenses. Reconstruction and relief expenses totaled 3,300,000,000 yuan, of which 800,000,000 yuan was for public works, 500,000,000 yuan was for direct relief to unemployed workers, 1,250,000,000 yuan was for work relief, 500,000,000 yuan was for grain purchases, and 250,000,000 yuan was for other expenses. The most significant achievement in the past three years is that the government has reduced interest rates by about one-quarter, thereby saving 260,000,000 yuan annually. However, the facts cannot be ignored, because after the implementation of sanctions, it is still not enough to change the trend of military action. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov said that Germany is preparing to invade, so he opposes reorganizing the League of Nations by weakening the covenant, and advocates strengthening the power of the covenant. There are many people who want to make the League of Nations descend to favor the actions of aggressor countries, which is unforgivable." (National News report from the 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e61">U.S. Naval Policy: Attention to Philippine Base <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) When asked by news reporters today whether the U.S. government plans to install 16-inch caliber guns on the two new battleships to be built, the director of U.S. naval tactics, Stanley, replied that this would be decided when the design of the two main battleships is completed, and that 16-inch caliber guns are more useful to the United States than the currently used 14-inch caliber ones. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter learned today that the U.S. Navy Department is paying close attention to maintaining a naval base in the Philippines. However, the decision on this matter must be made after the Philippines becomes fully independent, which is ten years from now. Military experts have divided into two factions, for and against, regarding the maintenance of this base. The reasons given by the proponents are as follows: 1. Foreign policy, especially the Open Door Policy in China, requires a well-organized defense system in the Far East. 2. American Pacific shipping routes, aviation lines, and round-the-world routes require bases to assist the navy in exerting its protection. 3. The American base in the Philippines is very close to the British base in Singapore, so it can serve as a forward joint base for the navies of both countries in case of emergency. 4. Building a strong naval base in the southern Philippines that can accommodate a large number of battleships will control the oil, tin, vegetable oil, and other necessary war materials of the Dutch East Indies. 5. If the people of the eastern Philippines decide to become a protectorate of the United States and do not wish to be independent, a permanent base can guarantee the American position in the Philippines. The reasons given by the opponents are as follows: 1. Building a naval base in the Philippines will change America's combat plans and lengthen transportation lines. If war breaks out, maintaining these transportation lines will be difficult. Most people believe that it will be impossible to maintain this base in the event of a major war. 2. The Philippines lacks industry, so if the transportation line to the United States is cut off by the enemy, it will not be able to maintain the fleet stationed in the archipelago. 3. If the United States builds a naval base in the Philippine Islands, it must build secondary bases in Guam and other islands. This will put the base directly in opposition to the Japanese navy, with no mutually recognized demilitarized zone separating them. 4. This naval base cannot harm the enemy's commerce. Even if powerful battleships are stationed here, they will be powerless, because any enemy in Asia can use other routes to transport the most important military materials. 5. The cost of maintaining a base in the Philippines is very high. Some experts here believe that it would be better to use this funding to build closer defense works. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines, Murphy, left here today for his hometown of Detroit. Prior to this, Mr. Murphy had consulted with Undersecretary of State Sayre on general issues related to the Philippines and the U.S.-Philippine business conference. Former Acting Secretary of State and newly appointed Ambassador to Italy, Phillips, was also present, so it is speculated that the discussions concerned the Far East issue and the international policy of the Philippines. At the same time, President Roosevelt will also invite Mr. Hausseman, a representative of the American business community in Manila, to the White House tomorrow to discuss Mr. Murphy's return, as Mr. Murphy may be running for governor of Michigan.

<h3 id="e73">President Wang Talks About the Reasons for Graduate Unemployment <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The problem of unemployment among students above the junior college level has become a major issue in recent years, arousing the attention of people across the country. According to President Wang's statement on the 1st, the Ministry of Education, in view of the past surplus of liberal arts students and the shortage of practical talents, and the abnormal development of higher education, believes that this is a major reason for graduate unemployment. In recent years, liberal arts departments have been merged and practical departments have been added. The enrollment ratio of various colleges and departments of universities has been stipulated and strictly enforced. After this reorganization and improvement, the talents cultivated can gradually adapt to the needs of the country, so the unemployment situation of graduates is not as serious as rumored. There are a total of 108 public and private junior colleges and above in the country, with approximately 8,000 graduates each year. The total number of graduates in the 22nd and 23rd years was more than 15,200, and approximately 13,000 have been employed, accounting for 87% of the total. The 2,400 unemployed account for approximately 13% of the total. And the graduates who are unemployed due to using what they did not learn, mid-career unemployment, and married female students who cannot be employed due to family relations are also included. Among them, those in the liberal arts and law departments account for three-quarters, and those in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine account for one-tenth to two-tenths. If the number of unemployed in each department is compared with the number of graduates in that department, the liberal arts account for 22%, and the law departments account for approximately 17%, which is the highest. The engineering departments account for 3%, which is the lowest. The number of unemployed medical students accounts for only 1% of the number of graduates, which is even lower than the other two departments. Among the public and private junior colleges and above in the country, one-fifth of the schools reported no unemployed students, such as Tongji, Jiaotong University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Business College, Beiyang Institute of Technology, Xiehe Medical College, and the Music Academy. Judging from this situation, the unemployment situation of graduates from junior colleges and above is not more serious than in other countries. The government has already taken various practical measures. If the country's construction industry is further expanded, the facilities of our higher education will be able to fully meet the needs of the country. (Central News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Japan has decided on a "New Southern Policy," using Taiwan as a base for active southward expansion. Although it is stated on the surface that this is only for the economic development of South China and Southeast Asia, the military arrangements in Taiwan this year have also become increasingly active. The slogan is "Taiwan is the First Line of National Defense." Since March, the Taiwanese military authorities have re-demarcated the main areas and prohibited outsiders from entering restricted areas, guarded by armed military police with guns. Even local Taiwanese people are not allowed to approach within 25 yards without the permission of the authorities. Foreigners coming to Taiwan are followed closely by secret agents, similar to monitoring criminals. Photography is prohibited in some places that have not been designated as restricted areas. Military equipment has been continuously shipped from Japan to Taiwan in recent months. Some are machinery for manufacturing military equipment, and most are military equipment and supplies. It is said that from January to the present, a large number of anti-aircraft guns, field guns, machine guns, and rifles have been shipped from Japan. Iron wire mesh, camp tents, and other military supplies are even more difficult to count. On average, two transport ships arrive in Taiwan from Japan every week, all carrying these items. In the past week alone, 560 boxes of munitions have been transported, and each truck is guarded by a soldier for a day after unloading. The Taiwanese coolies who transport the goods are also unable to identify the marks on the boxes. In addition, the strength of the Taiwanese army was originally one regiment, but it has recently been proposed to add a division. This has been proposed to the Cabinet by Army Minister Terauchi. If it is realized, the Taiwanese army will have a strength of 25,000. At the end of last month, the Joint Conference of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce resolved to petition the Cabinet to establish an army corps headquarters in Taiwan and to add a naval defense headquarters to meet the needs of national defense in "extraordinary times." At the same time, it is also planned to increase the number of the 3rd Air Wing stationed in Taiwan. The construction of the airfield began last month, with a large number of conscripted laborers. In addition, the North-South railway, which runs through Taiwan, will be re-laid with double tracks after Governor-General Nakagawa summoned specialized technical personnel for planning. Several branch lines will also be added, reaching the main coastal military areas directly. At the same time, the entire Taiwan highway network is being planned. The above plans have been drafted and will be implemented upon approval by the Cabinet. The Penghu Makung naval port fortress was entered by foreign merchant ships seeking shelter from the wind seven times between June of last year and March of this year. The navy regarded them as spies and seriously reported them. However, the court only imposed fines and released them in accordance with the Navigation Law for insufficient evidence. The navy finally believed that this was an organized international espionage activity and announced the blockade of Makung Port, abolishing the opening of Makung as a foreign commercial port and prohibiting all foreign ships from entering and leaving Makung Port, which was implemented on July 1. Although Green Makung is a naval port fortress, there is also a commercial port in the same place. Now, because foreign ships sometimes enter the naval port, the commercial port is also closed, absolutely prohibiting foreign ships from taking this route to prevent spies from peeking. The Japanese First Fleet, consisting of 40 ships and more than 10,000 officers and men, led by Commander Takahashi, entered the Keelung naval port in Taipei on the 27th of last month. At the same time, the Second Fleet, consisting of 30 ships, entered the Kaohsiung Port in Tainan. Both fleets are the main force of the Japanese Navy. They came to Taiwan from the south after a large-scale exercise in a certain area. The First Fleet came to Taiwan once in the Showa 8th year (1933), this is the second time, and the First and Second Fleets have come together for the first time. From now on, the First and Second Fleets will often come to Makung and Keelung. In addition, the Japanese fleet is currently conducting combat exercises in the waters off Taiwan, Xiamen, and Shantou. It has been two weeks since the 14th, and Nan'ao, Jianshan, and Xiamen are all within its line. The actions are very noteworthy. Also, Japan has recently been advocating strengthening the military and political organization of Taiwan and advocating that the Governor-General of Taiwan be promoted, like the current Governor-General of Korea. A general-level military officer will be appointed as the Governor-General, whose position is parallel to that of the Prime Minister, directly under the Japanese Emperor, and can directly report to the Emperor without being subordinate to the Colonial Affairs Ministry and the Cabinet. This proposal is still being disputed by the Cabinet, the Colonial Affairs Ministry, and the military. If it is realized, the current Governor-General Nakagawa will resign and the naval general Kobayashi Jizao will be the first Governor-General, facing the Korean Governor-General and army general Ugaki in the north.

<h3 id="e78">Zhang Kewu, Bandit Leader in Southern Fujian, Accepts Pacification and Reorganization; Guangdong Army in Dabu Suddenly Prohibits Transportation of Rice, Grain, and Sundries to Fujian <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Due to the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, a tense situation has arisen between Fujian and Guangdong. Although Guangdong has increased troops along the border, it has not dared to enter Fujian territory, so although the situation is tense, it has not yet reached the stage of action. What is currently attracting more attention is the issue of bandits in southern Fujian. Although the bandits in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Zhangzhou are taking the opportunity to move, a large number of small clowns are not enough to worry about. In fact, the strength of the Dehua Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu gangs, which is the greatest and most worrying, has now been successfully recruited, and the bandit problem in southern Fujian has been largely solved. After Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu withdrew from Datian, they occupied Guijin on the border of Yongchun and Dehua. The Security Office sent Zhu Lvxing, a provincial government councilor, to Dehua to recruit them. Zhu ordered Ke Jiefu, the former chief of staff of Zhang Xiongnan, to contact Zhang Kewu. Zhang expressed his sincerity in accepting pacification. Ke negotiated back and forth. On the 28th, Han Wenying, Peng Tang, Xing Guoluan, the magistrate of Dehua County, and others finally agreed to send Zhu Lvxing and Ke Jiefu, together with representatives from all walks of life in Dehua, to Houchi (20 miles from the county seat) in the bandit area to meet Zhang Kewu. The method of acceptance and compilation was agreed on the 29th: 1. The sons of Zhang Xiongnan and the wives of Zhang Chengfu and Zhang's subordinates, who were captured during the previous suppression of Zhang's troops, will be transferred to the Provincial Security Office as hostages and released after the acceptance and compilation are properly arranged. 2. Zhang Kewu, Zhang Chengfu, and Xu Feifeng's troops must gather at Xishan within ten days to await the assignment of personnel from the Security Office for review and compilation. 3. During the period when Zhang's troops are concentrated in Xishan, all troops and security regiments stationed near Xishan will be temporarily withdrawn. 4. After the review and compilation, they will be compiled into security regiments and assigned to a county near Dehua (such as Anxi, Yongchun, Nan'an, or Datian) for centralized training and will be responsible for the security of the county. 5. After the review and compilation, the Security Office will provide substantial supplies. The above five items will be implemented successively after being approved by the Standing Committee. It is also internally decided that Zhang Kewu will be the regiment commander, Zhu Lvxing will be the lieutenant colonel regiment adjutant, and Zhang Chengfu and others will be the battalion commanders. The compilation of Zhang's troops has been completed. From now on, only the review and compilation training work remains. As for the Anxi Lv Zhenshan gang, although it has 700 or 800 men, its strength is far inferior to that of Zhang's troops. They have recently disturbed Taizhou and the border of Yongchun and are being jointly suppressed by the Fifth Security Regiment. There is also news that Lv's troops will soon be recruited, but there has been no concrete negotiation. In addition, although there are many small gangs in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Zhangzhou, they are all only dozens or hundreds of people (the most is Zhang Heshan of Nanjing with 200 people). The security regiments are able to control them. The Provincial Government commissioned She Nianci as the commander of the Bandit Suppression in Southern Fujian on the 27th. All local regiments are under his command. Mr. Yu was the original deputy director of the Security Office and is very familiar with the situation in southern Fujian. He also became familiar with various factions of the local army in southern Fujian when he recruited all the local army in the province last year. With Yu's combined suppression and pacification, it will not be difficult to quell the situation. As for Guangdong Province, there are currently four divisions, one brigade, and two regiments of the Guangdong Army in 26 counties and cities. Jiaoling, Meixian, Dabu, and Raoping are under the command of Huang Renhuan of the 1st Independent Division; Fengshun, Chaoan, and Shantou are under the command of Chen Guanghan of the Guard Brigade; Zijin, Boluo, Heyuan, and Huizhou are under the command of Huang Yanzhen of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army; the 8th Division of Huang Zhiwen; Fengshun, Punin, Jieyang, and Chaoan are under the command of Deng Longguang of the 9th Division and two newly transferred salt police regiments. The organization of the Guangdong Army is: the 1st Independent Division has two brigades, with three regiments each, for a total of six regiments; the Guard Brigade has three regiments; each division of the 3rd Army has three regiments and one supplementary regiment for a total of four regiments. Currently, there are 23 regiments of Guangdong Army troops on the border of the East River and Chaoshan. In addition, there are three divisions and a total of twelve regiments of the First Army south of Xunwu in southern Jiangxi, which are now ordered to withdraw to the border of the East River and Jiangxi. Zhang Ruigui of the Third Division has withdrawn from Xunwu to Pingyuan. Therefore, the Guangdong Army that can be stationed in the East River area totals 35 regiments. It is necessary to guard against both Fujian and Jiangxi, and only the Huang Division, Chen Brigade, Deng Division, and Zhang Ruigui's salt police, etc., a total of 19 regiments, are close to the Fujian border. The Guangdong Army is currently, except for Huang Renhuan's division and Yan Brigade's move to Wuling and Zeng Brigade's move to Dabu and Raoping, a battalion of the Guard Chen Brigade has recently taken over the defense of Huanggang, Chenghai, on the border between Guangdong and Fujian. There has been no further increase in troops on the Guangdong border. However, recently, the Guangdong Army in Dabu suddenly prohibited the transportation of rice, grain, and sundries to western Fujian, causing a rice shortage and price increase in Fengshi. The price of rice in Shanghang has risen to only 5.5 sheng per yuan. Shanghang purchased foreign rice from Chaoshan and transported it to Dabu, where it was detained by the Guangdong Army. Sundries purchased in Yongding were also detained in Lushi. The Guangdong Army has recently blockaded Lushi, because Fengshi is an important town on the Fujian border where the Han River flows into the area. Passing Fengshi is Dabu in Guangdong, and Lushi is downstream of Fengshi in Dabu. The four counties of Changting, Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding in western Fujian are in the upper reaches of the Han River basin. The import and export of goods from the four counties all pass through the Han River, with Fengshi as the general hub, passing through Dabu in Guangdong to the Chaoshan estuary for import and export. Now that the Guangdong Army has suddenly imposed a blockade, western Fujian has been greatly affected. Merchants and residents in Hangyong County have appealed to the governments of the two counties for relief and have petitioned and negotiated with the Guangdong Army in Dabu. This matter cannot but be said to be a serious situation in the tension between Fujian and Guangdong. (July 2)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Anhui Province Intensifies Flood Control; Liu Zhenhua Schedules Periodic Inspections; Telegram Orders Preparation of Flood Prevention Materials <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The water level of the Yangtze River is rising daily, especially in the past week. The Wuhu Customs water gauge has risen to 23 feet and 5 inches on the 1st, which is several inches higher than at the same time last year. The Yangtze River liners, because the islands and beaches on both sides below Datong are submerged by water and the original channels have lost their landmarks, are mostly sailing cautiously, so that the downstream wheels will be delayed until 7:00 AM to arrive at the port, about three hours later than usual. As for the small wheels running to various inland rivers, according to the customs regulations, they must stop running when the water level reaches 25 feet to avoid flushing the embankment and affecting flood prevention. The small wheels will temporarily stop running in the first ten days of the month. At this time of high water level, flood prevention along the river has reached a critical juncture. In addition to strictly ordering the supervisors of the twelve counties, including Huaining and Wuhu, to step up their work to ensure thorough prevention, Chairman Liu Zhenhua has also scheduled to depart from Anqing by wheel on the 5th of this month, accompanied by Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department, and Jiang Shihui, Director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, to inspect the downstream counties and supervise flood prevention. He telegraphed all the county magistrates along the river yesterday to meet him. In addition to informing them of the location to be decided temporarily by telegram, he also ordered them to quickly supervise their subordinates to prepare materials for flood control and labor, and to select dangerous areas for prevention. They must present a special report when the time comes. The Wuhu County Government, after receiving the telegram, has ordered all the dike chairmen to follow the instructions, quickly prepare flood prevention materials, and select dangerous areas for construction, without any delay.

<h3 id="e80">Songjiang: Bandit Leader Executed by Firing Squad in Punan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The bandit leader of Punan, Li Jinxiang, aged thirty-seven, was a native of Caojing in this county. He repeatedly formed gangs in Punan to commit murder and robbery. On October 10th of last year, he and his gang robbed a passenger bus on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway near Yanggong Temple. On October 26th, they robbed firearms from the sentry post of Ye Shaoqing's house in Mazhen Village, causing a great sensation at the time. The provincial government ordered a strict time limit for investigation and arrest. Subsequently, he committed robberies in Jiangzhuang and other places. Finally, in April, District Security Commander Wang ordered Zhao Zanchen, the former commander of the Twelfth Security Brigade, to lead troops to Punan to suppress the bandits. They bought information and arrested Li Jinxiang at Lannidu in Pudong. Under interrogation, Li Jinxiang confessed to numerous crimes without denying anything. He was handed over to the District Security Command for a thorough interrogation. In accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Provisional Regulations for Handling Bandits and Robbers during the Bandit Suppression Period, he was sentenced to death. The sentence was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Bureau, which issued Directive No. 5518, ordering execution of the sentence as ruled. After receiving the order, Commander Wang immediately identified the prisoner, paraded him through the bustling streets, and then executed him by firing squad at the small drill ground.</p>

<p>One evening at nine o'clock, two female students from the Art School, Wang Zhi-sheng and another, were walking near Yan Bridge in the vicinity of the city park. Suddenly, they were confronted by a thug dressed in white who forcibly snatched Ms. Wang's handbag and fled. Ms. Wang immediately ordered a rickshaw puller, Yang Yong-sheng, to pursue him. The handbag was recovered, but twelve yuan in legal tender and two aviation lottery tickets that had been inside were missing. Suspecting that the rickshaw puller, Yang Yong-sheng, had an accomplice, they reported to the police, who took him into custody. On the 2nd, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The Public Security Bureau has also ordered the detective team to arrest the thug and bring him to justice in order to maintain local治安.</p>

<p>The county government, noting that the collection of field taxes for the 24th year of the Republic, although collection points have been open for more than three months, is still less than eighty percent of the target. Considering the matter concerns national taxation, has specially ordered various tax collectors to select large households for detention and forceful collection. In recent days, the results have been excellent. It is reported that more than 20,000 yuan has already been collected. The government is also strictly pursuing smaller tax debtors.</p>

<p>Zhenyingdao Lane in this city has been widened according to a plan by the County Construction Bureau, with all roadside buildings obstructing the road being demolished. Construction has been underway for three months. Bridge, roadbed, and drainage ditch projects have been completed long ago. Recently, the Construction Bureau urged workers to pave the stone road surface. The sidewalks on both sides are paved with six bricks each. The road surface is six meters wide. The section from the Daxiong Hall of Chong'an Temple to Xicheng Gate is named Fuxing Road, and the section from Xicheng Gate to Dexin Bridge is named Xicheng Road. Yesterday (the 2nd), the Fuxing Road surface was completely completed and open to traffic. It is planned that Xicheng Road will be paved today and is expected to be completed in a week.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Wuxi Station Chief Monitored Due to Case <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly serious and has spread to the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway area. Recently, it was suddenly discovered that Wuxi Station staff members were also involved in transporting untaxed goods. The following is a summary of the matter: Wang Xingen, a ticket checker at Wuxi Station, a native of Ningbo, is known for his social skills. Last year, he was dismissed from his position by Station Chief Li Guisheng after being found to have violated station regulations. Afterwards, Wang opened a cheap eatery near the station with Zhao Benli, who trafficked in drugs. Relying on his previous work relationship with the station staff, he actually specialized in transporting untaxed goods. In July of last year, Wang also joined forces with unscrupulous merchants from Shanghai, and his business grew daily. Recently, smuggled goods from North China have infiltrated the Jinghu Railway line. The Railway Bureau began a secret investigation, and occasionally discovered goods without waybills on trains between Wujin and Wuxi, which prompted close attention. Last month, Wang Xingen shipped ten pieces of smuggled yarn from Shanghai to Wuxi for delivery, but was discovered by the Railway Bureau, who sent police to follow him to Wuxi, preventing him from unloading the goods. He continued straight to Wujin. The Wujin station chief, seeing that he had no waybill, confronted him. Wang Xingen was handed over to the railway police and escorted to the Shanghai Railway Police Department for strict interrogation. Wang confessed to organizing a smuggling operation in Wuxi and implicated Station Chief Li Guisheng, Deputy Station Chief Shi Jintang, the heads of the freight and baggage departments, as well as more than ten other staff members, machinists, and workers. After learning of this, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Railway Bureau, was extremely angry. Believing that both the truth and the rumors should be thoroughly investigated, he sent Director Xiao to Wuxi to investigate. It is reported that Station Chief Li has been placed under surveillance. Other involved individuals have already left their positions under various pretexts, and Zhao Benli, Wang Xingen's partner, has fled to Dalian, effectively becoming a traitor.</p>

<p>Opium cases in the eight counties under the jurisdiction of the Second District—Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Yixing, Changshu, Jiangyin, Taicang, and Wujiang—are uniformly handled by opium case adjudicators appointed by the District Security Command and stationed in each county. Now, in order to unify authority and facilitate office work, the government has ordered that the opium case adjudicators originally stationed in the county governments of the above-mentioned counties be transferred to work at the District Security Command. All opium and drug cases in the counties within this district will be sent directly to the District Security Command for adjudication from July 1st. He Bingzhou, the military judge originally stationed in the Wuxi County Government, and the clerks have all moved to the District Command yesterday. The other counties will also be transferred back within the next few days for centralized adjudication. Furthermore, the District Management Office has been established with provincial orders. Wang Zipei has been appointed as the director of the District Management Office, and Wang Chongxi as the inspector, specifically in charge of the expenses, firearms, and other matters of the security teams in various counties within this district.</p>

Qian's wife, surnamed Gao, was 27 years old. One morning, before going to work in the field, Qian instructed Gao to sort out the wheat straw. However, when Qian returned home in the evening, the wheat straw was still untouched. Qian became angry and beat Gao with a bamboo pole. Accidentally, one foot kicked Gao in the lower back, a vital area, causing her to laugh to death on the spot. After the village chief reported it to the county, officials were dispatched to the village to inspect and verify the facts. Qian has been arrested.</p>

When passing over the Toushi Stone Bridge of Dongyue Temple, Liu saw that Zhu's and others' vehicles were driving fast and had fallen behind alone, so he tried his best to catch up. Because of excessive exertion, both he and his vehicle fell into the river. Seeing that there was no way to save him, Zhu rushed back to the city to inform Liu's family. In the afternoon, Liu's father-in-law, Mr. Weng, led people out of the city to search. The body has not yet been recovered, and the bicycle is also missing.</p>

<p>Within the Second District, the banditry is rampant. On the evening of the 26th, two bandit boats with more than ten bandits armed with firearms arrived at Xiejiazhuang in Beining Township. After arriving at the village, they fired their guns as a warning and then separately looted various shops and residences. After three hours, they escaped with a full load of stolen goods. Because there were no stationed troops or police in the area, the bandits did whatever they wanted. It is estimated that seventeen shops and twenty-eight households were robbed, with total losses of nearly 5,000 yuan. The worst loss was the family of Chief Yu Bao, who runs a grocery, oil, wine, and cloth shop, with more than 2,000 yuan worth of cash, jewelry, and goods stolen, as well as two rifles and one box gun. The Liu Taiyuan mill was robbed of 600 yuan in cash. Other shops, such as Zhu Jiuhong's silversmith shop, Zhang Faxin's grocery store, and Lu Yiyuan's sauce shop, suffered losses ranging from dozens to more than a hundred yuan. The losses to households were also mostly more than a hundred yuan. Unexpectedly, on the 28th, two more bandit boats came and robbed five or six families, seizing more than fifty stones of wheat. The village has suffered huge losses from the two robberies.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Association, considering that the summer silkworm season will end this month and preparations for the autumn silkworm season are urgently needed, reports that the total number of improved autumn silkworm eggs needed by various counties is 800,000 sheets. In addition to ordering and supplying half of them from the Zhejiang provincial breeding farms, the remaining 400,000 sheets will be purchased from the Jiangsu provincial breeding farms. To reduce the egg prices paid by farmers to 45 cents and to improve guidance work, 100 long-term instructors will be recruited. The exam will be held over three days, starting on July 1st, and the results should be announced next week.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 kilometers of highways in Zhejiang Province have been completed and opened to traffic. Transportation between eastern and western Zhejiang and the provincial capital has become increasingly convenient. However, due to the large construction costs, the provincial treasury is extremely stretched, resulting in arrears of approximately 3 million yuan in construction fees owed to contractors. After repeated petitions from the contractors for allocation of funds, the Construction Bureau issued more than 1 million yuan in local public bonds, so more than 2 million yuan has been repaid. The remaining 800,000 yuan will be issued and cleared at the end of this month by discounting the newly issued reorganization bonds. In addition, 3 million yuan in road funds borrowed from the Four Provinces Farmers Bank and the Dalu, Yanye, Zhongnan, and Jincheng Banks by the Construction Bureau last year. Except for more than 400,000 yuan that has been repaid successively, the remaining 1.6 million will be repaid by the Finance Department with public bonds.</p>

Its initial symptoms are headache and fever. Within an hour, the hands and feet contract, and the patient becomes unconscious and unable to speak. Death occurs within a week. It is spreading uncontrollably in the city and outside the southeast gate. Since the 29th of last month, no fewer than dozens of people have died from the epidemic, and children are especially numerous among the victims. In order to prevent the epidemic, the county government has ordered the county hospital and Xiaoshan Hospital to administer vaccinations as a means of saving lives.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Pinghu: Civil Servant Caught Smoking Opium <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Zhapu District Office, noting that the learning grain donation is heavily in arrears, sent police officers to the villages to collect it. When urging collection at Datingfang, they learned that many people were gathering at a temple, openly smoking opium. They ambushed and arrested the opium smokers. Upon hearing the police, the opium smokers broke out of the door and fled, with many escaping. Only two offenders were caught on the spot and sent to the district office. Under interrogation, it was learned that one of them was Qian Youren, the chief of the Fifth Bao in the district. The district chief believed that Qian, as a civil servant, should not privately smoke opium with others, which is a clear violation of criminal law. Therefore, despite repeated pleas from the Qian family, he resolutely refused. Yesterday, the district chief sent the bao chief and another smoker surnamed Shen, along with the smoking paraphernalia, to the county for legal punishment.</p>
<p>Artistic Musings</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Art of the Fan (Part 1) <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Even in times of war and chaos, one can spare a little time to discuss the art of the fan waved by noble sons and grandsons.</p>
<p>The fan is a form of calligraphy and painting that has particularly flourished in China. This can also be regarded as one of the symbols of the Orient. In Western paintings that take Oriental themes, a folding fan is often used as an embellishment; and the humorous Spanish painters are very fond of using fans in their paintings. It is indeed a very leisurely thing. One does not need to work with one's hands, but simply waves the fan for one's own comfort; or even does not need to wave the fan, but simply looks at the calligraphy and painting on the fan for one's own visual pleasure. Is this not the clear bliss of a refined person? Therefore, it is reasonable for Westerners to like to use fans as a symbol of ancient Oriental customs. However, the art of painting fans is still a specialty of the Orientals. We have never seen fans depicted with pencil drawings, watercolor drawings, or oil paintings in Western paintings; conversely, in Chinese paintings, fan faces occupy a special position. In the fee schedules of calligraphers and painters, there is usually a "fan face" category, and some of them are particularly expensive; on the walls of mounting shops, there are often scrolls made of fan faces, which are regarded as a particularly elegant decoration in the study of scholars. This proves that in the past, painting art was particularly developed in China, not only were paintings hung everywhere in halls and rooms, but even the fan, a practical item for summer, was used by painters as a place to showcase their talents; thus, this practical item was "artified" and made into an art that was separated from practicality and independent, a "fan face for the sake of a fan face." It also proves that in the past, people's lives in China were particularly leisurely, not only did they have the time to wave a fan, but they had to wave a fan with paintings on it to seek comfort for both body and spirit, a comfortable unity of body and soul.</p>
<p>Therefore, both the painting methods of fans and the uses of fans are artistic specialties of the Chinese people. When it comes to painting methods, because its outline shape is special, the layout of the painting also has a different approach. Most painting materials are suitable for using parts of objects—such as a broken branch of flowers, a part of a bamboo forest, or fruit hanging in the air. Or, it is suitable to use scenery that does not show the horizon—such as continuous mountains, undulating jungles, or scenery covered by clouds and fog. In short, it is not suitable to show the horizon on the fan face, because the outline is arc-shaped, and the horizon line runs from the upper left corner to the upper right corner, dividing the fan into jagged upper and lower parts, which is unaesthetic. In Chinese fan paintings, figure paintings are relatively few, because figures must have houses as a background, and houses are square things, which easily show the horizon, which hinders the composition. Landscape paintings are the most numerous, because landscapes are high and low, left and right, and the horizon line can be concealed everywhere, making it easy to arrange the painting. Fortunately, there is no fan face category in Western painting; if there were, Western painters would be worried to death about the composition! Because Western paintings pay the same attention to the background as to the main object. There is no painting without a background. In Chinese paintings, there is often a painting method in which there is no background at all, and the main object is suspended in a blank sheet of paper. But from the perspective of Western painting, these are unfinished works. If Westerners were taught to paint, they would have to add many things behind, either the sky or the ground, and must express the place where the main object is located. Therefore, Western paintings must have a background, must conform to the laws of perspective, that is, must have a horizon line. In the outline of the fan face, it is difficult to arrange it properly. Perhaps this is also one of the reasons why fan paintings have flourished in China. The imaginative, irrelevant, and patterned Chinese paintings can be cleverly packed into any outline. This can also be said to be a feature of Oriental art.</p>

However, due to the opposition of the vendors to these regulations, the executive committee resolved to temporarily suspend the price increases. The new regulations will be postponed for six months (i.e., January 1, 1937). At present, wholesale prices will only follow the ten price guidelines issued by the Ministry.

<p>Overseas Chinese Merchant Wu Zuonan Reports to Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to connect with overseas Chinese and inspect industry in Siam, our country organized a Siamese inspection group of more than ten people, led by the heads Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou, who traveled to Siam. Before leaving, Li Dachao and Wu Tailiang sent telegrams and letters to overseas Chinese Wu Zuonan, etc., requesting them to provide hospitality. We now have a letter reporting the grand welcome the overseas Chinese gave to the inspection group. The details are as follows: To Mr. Dachao, I received your esteemed telegram and Mr. Kanghou brought it to China. I am greatly honored to hear your kind words. I immediately contacted various overseas Chinese groups as instructed. On the day the inspection group arrived in Siam, thousands of people thronged the streets to welcome them. The Siamese government had previously sent a table of reception arrangements. Therefore, the various overseas Chinese groups either held separate meetings to welcome them or hosted banquets. The events were held daily according to the table. The Siamese government also provided exceptional hospitality, hosting banquets and providing theatrical performances for entertainment. Their expression of friendship between China and Siam can be said to be profound. Recently, I also sent my son Zhulin to guide the members of the group to visit various scenic spots and inspect all conditions. I believe that after the members of the group return home, they will have contributions and plans to offer. More details will follow later. Respectfully, I wish you well. Wu Tailiang also received a letter from them, with the same meaning. Wu Zuonan is a wealthy merchant in Siam and enjoys widespread respect. He is also friends with many people in the Siamese government. His businesses, including forestry, timber, burlap bags, and non-ferrous metals, have branches throughout China and abroad, extending as far as London, New York, Cuba, South Africa, and the Netherlands, all major commercial ports with interconnected networks. He is a giant among the overseas Chinese in Siam. The Shanghai Wuguang Jilong Company is one of its branches. His sons, Wu Bolin and Wu Zhulin, also have extensive commercial experience.</p>

<p>Claims Fujian-Guangdong Border is Currently Peaceful</p>
<p>To Proceed to Nanjing Tomorrow Evening to Attend the Second Plenary Session</p>
<p>Chen Zhaoying, the Zhejiang-Fujian Regional Supervisory Commissioner and concurrently the Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Special Envoy, arrived in Shanghai at 2:15 PM yesterday via China National Aviation Corporation flight to attend the Second Plenary Session. He is staying at the residence of his relative, Mr. Zhang, on Muirhead Road. He is scheduled to proceed to Nanjing by train tomorrow evening. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid him a special visit. According to Mr. Chen:</p>
<p>No Trouble on the Fujian Border: In the Longyan area of southwestern Fujian Province, a small number of unruly elements from the old disbanded local militias are constantly looking for opportunities to disrupt the peace. Therefore, Director Jiang (Dingwen) dispatched troops to suppress them. The sole purpose is to maintain local order. It appears that Guangdong Province is mobilizing its troops, but they have not yet crossed into Fujian. The border between the two provinces remains peaceful. As for other areas within the province, everything is very calm and there are no signs of unrest.</p>
<p>A Turning Point in the Current Situation: It is said that the southwest region will definitely send representatives to attend the Second Plenary Session, but the candidates are unknown. The turning point in the current situation will depend on the Second Plenary Session. It is regrettable that some comrades in the southwest cannot understand the Central Government's difficult position in dealing with the national crisis. It is essential to understand that to speak of resisting foreign aggression, the whole country must be united. There should be no local actions, and personal prejudices should not be stubbornly adhered to, causing chaos. Otherwise, local losses will be minor, but the country's losses will be significant. Looking at the current situation, the local losses in Guangdong and Guangxi are already evident, such as the sharp drop in currency value. The people of the two provinces are already full of complaints. Hopefully, Mr. Chen, Mr. Li, and Mr. Bai will come to their senses after being advised by all parties.</p>
<p>Party Affairs and Officialdom: Mr. Chen continued, stating that Fujian's party affairs have seen progress in recent years. In the past two years, the focus has been on self-organization. Now, efforts are being intensified to train the people and organize mass groups, which have become more robust. As for formal elections and the restoration of the provincial party headquarters, the Central Government has not yet set a date. This is because some provinces have established party headquarters with a committee system, while others have a simple system with special envoys appointed by the Central Government. The Central Government is currently comparing and studying the advantages and disadvantages of the simple system versus the committee system. Since the implementation of the supervisory commissioner system in Fujian, judicial and political personnel have been more honest than before. Currently, most of the cases received by the supervisory commissioner's office involve lower-ranking officials such as district chiefs and joint guarantee directors. Some county magistrates have also been accused, mostly in connection with surcharges on land taxes. In terms of provincial administration, since Chairman Chen (Yi) took office, there has been significant progress. Although some plans have not been realized immediately, the overall situation is good. For example, in terms of road construction, last year it was only in a rough state, but now the roadbeds have been consolidated. Mr. Chen concluded by saying that he is scheduled to proceed to Nanjing by train on the evening of the fourth to attend the meeting of regional supervisory commissioners on the fifth and to prepare for the Second Plenary Session.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Anti-Smoking Inspector Ma Liang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Will Actively Negotiate Prohibition of Smoking in the Concessions</p>
<p>Since its implementation, the issue of smoking prohibition in this city has achieved good results in the Chinese area. Although it is more difficult to implement in the concessions, the concession authorities should also respect China's anti-smoking laws. Therefore, this matter may be resolved satisfactorily in the near future. A Central News Agency reporter investigates and reports on the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting Smoking Prohibition in the Concessions: Ma Liang, the Jiangsu and Shanghai Anti-Smoking Inspector appointed by the Central Government, is preparing to conduct effective negotiations on the enforcement of China's anti-smoking laws in the concessions after arriving in Shanghai. Inspector Ma has repeatedly discussed the progress of these negotiations with Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city. Mayor Wu also believes that the area of the concessions is particularly unique, with a large population of residents. If the same methods are not adopted as in the Chinese area, it will have a significant impact on the entire anti-smoking issue in this city. Therefore, he has sent personnel to conduct verbal negotiations with the concession authorities. In addition, Inspector Ma has also exchanged views with prominent figures in this city who are enthusiastic about the issue of smoking prohibition. They are also willing to wholeheartedly assist in the smooth implementation of China's anti-smoking laws in the concessions and make suggestions to the concession authorities, so that the issue of smoking prohibition in this city can achieve a thorough effect.</p>
<p>Traveling to Zhenjiang to Discuss Anti-Smoking Administration: Inspector Ma came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang yesterday. According to him, the concession authorities now show considerable sympathy for China's vigorous anti-smoking policy and are willing to provide strong assistance. Therefore, in practice, after various parties have explained and negotiated with the concession authorities, certain results have been achieved. The commissioner will make further efforts in the next week to promote this matter, as he is preparing to go to Nanjing in a week to meet with Director-General Jiang. In addition to reporting on the recent situation of smoking prohibition in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai, he will also make a final request for instructions on the issue of smoking prohibition in the concessions. As for his trip to Zhenjiang the other day, it was to discuss the issue of smoking prohibition in that province with the Jiangsu provincial authorities. He returned to Shanghai after completing the matter and did not go to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau Hosted a Press Reception Yesterday Regarding Flag Prices <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Deliberation and Determination of Flag Prices, Demonstrating the Proportion of the Current Price Reduction</p>
<p>The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau initially suffered from rumors, leading outsiders to suspect that the raw materials for its flag manufacturing were not entirely domestic products. Some even disregarded the facts and publicly criticized it in writing. The Bureau then openly invited people from all walks of life to visit on May 7th to prove the fact that it spins, weaves, prints, and dyes its own materials. This was to ensure that people from all walks of life would know that all raw materials, except for the dyes, were entirely domestic products, so that fair-minded people would not be deceived. Afterwards, those who intentionally criticized the Bureau, unable to find fault with the raw materials and technology, turned to criticizing the flag prices. The 46th Branch of the Citizens' Joint Association of the First Special District of Shanghai successively sent letters to the General Association requesting it to submit a petition to the Party and government authorities to reduce prices. In addition to replying factually, the Bureau specifically hosted a banquet for the press yesterday to report on the facts of the pricing process. Many representatives from various newspapers attended. First, Zhang Zilian, the chairman of the Bureau's Committee, delivered a speech, stating that before the central government promulgated the standards for Party and National Flag printing and dyeing, the flags sold on the market were all pieced together and sewn together from faded flags, and the raw materials for the cloth were mostly foreign goods. I believe that you all understand that after this Bureau adopted the process of independently spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, and completing the entire process of making the Party and National Flag, it prepared a detailed cost budget by item in accordance with the flag manufacturing and sales procedures and submitted it to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of the Interior for approval. In addition to sending personnel to conduct on-site inspections in accordance with the budget items, the two departments also purchased various flags sold on the market at that time, referred to the prices in the purchase invoices, and negotiated the first flag price. According to the market price of flags at that time, a No. 6 flag cost between 2.4 yuan and 2.8 yuan, which was already more than 13% lower than the market price of flags at that time. Afterwards, in order to care for the people's hardships, the two departments considered selling more and reducing the burden on the people as much as possible, and negotiated the second flag price. The second flag price of the No. 6 flag was set at 2 yuan per flag, which was 30% lower than the market price of flags sold previously. From the purely commercial point of view, the price set was actually too low. The flags sold on the market were made of multiple pieces of cloth, pieced together and sewn together, and the color would fade after being exposed to the sun and rain. The raw materials for the flag cloth were mostly foreign goods. The flags currently made are made independently in one piece, and the color will not fade after being exposed to the sun and rain. The raw materials for the flag cloth, starting from the cotton used for spinning, are all domestic products. Therefore, the technology of the material and spirit of the flag is far superior to that of the flags sold on the market before. Logically, the material spirit and technology of the flag are far superior to the flags sold previously, which were pieced together, sewn together, and easily faded. The raw materials, except for the pigments, are all purely domestic products. Rewards should be given for progress in improving the material, expressing the spirit, and improving the technology. The flag prices should be slightly increased compared to the original flag prices sold on the market as the cost of correcting the material, expressing the spirit, and improving the technology. Today, we have not only not demanded this cost, but also absolutely abandoned the concept of reasonable commercial profit, respected the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of the Interior's main purpose of considering the people's hardships, and unconditionally obeyed the repeatedly reduced flag prices. The purpose of our manufacturing and selling the Party and National Flags is entirely as stated in the promotional declaration: to awaken the heavy-laden hearts of the people who are lying in wait for the time to resist aggression, and to do our best to fulfill our national duty. We have not paid attention to profit-seeking. This can prove that even a very small number of people with selfish ideas still do not want to face the facts and forcefully criticize without purpose, causing fair-minded people to be deceived again. This is not because we oppose criticizing the flag prices, but because their criticism lacks reasonable facts and evidence. Those who want to criticize the flag prices as expensive must have a comparison of facts or be able to cite evidence that the flag prices sold on the market before were indeed cheaper than the currently set flag prices, or have concrete facts sufficient to prove that the cost of the flag, which is equally in line with the Central Printing and Dyeing Law's standards, is indeed lower than the flag manufacturing budget set by this Bureau. Today, the criticizers have failed to cite these facts or evidence, making it impossible for people to believe that they have no ulterior motive. Previously, in order to appease people, this Bureau did not want to pursue legal action against this matter. Now, due to the pressure of the situation, we may no longer be allowed to maintain the value of forgiveness. We have specifically reported the process of deliberating and setting the flag prices, and the fact that the currently set flag prices are indeed 30% lower than the flag prices sold on the market before, to everyone, and explained the flag manufacturing and sales budget. Please understand the facts, give a fair evaluation, and hope that those who intentionally criticize in vain can focus on the overall situation, be aware of the reality, and no longer create tortuous and cunning ways to deceive fair-minded people. Others have said that our responsibility to have the entire nation hang national flags is a manifestation of the people's spirit of loving the country and the nation. This manifestation of spirit is sufficient to make the government believe that it has a reliable support, and to make all countries value the unified public opinion. Its significance is equivalent to the popular vote in Germany to support the leader's policies. If those who intentionally criticize in vain persist in their views of love and hatred, which cannot be changed, and are determined to destroy this Bureau's task of undertaking the manufacture of Party and National Flags, then this Bureau is also happy to transfer the right to undertake the task. As for the form of national economic decline, we should present to the Central Government that those who are unable to purchase No. 6 flags in their households should be allowed to purchase No. 5 flags. The previous market price of No. 5 flags was about 1.5 yuan per flag. Recently, this Bureau received an invoice from the Ningbo branch for the purchase of this flag, which was 1.3 yuan. The flag's style is still made of multiple pieces of cloth, pieced together and sewn together, while the current flag price set by this Bureau is 90 cents, which is 66% lower than the previous market price and 33% lower than the purchased flag invoice price. With the above facts, the difficulty of further price reductions is evident. In order to respect public sentiment and care for the people's hardships, the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of the Interior have twice specifically invited representatives from this Bureau to talk. As a result of the talks, the flag manufacturing and sales budget presented to the Central Government was studied, and in order to comply with the situation, it was proposed to reduce distribution costs in order to reduce flag prices. However, it was also feared that once distribution costs were reduced, the sales ability might be reduced. New marketing methods are currently being planned to achieve the best of both worlds. The colleagues of this Bureau, who are responsible for manufacturing and selling the Party and National Flags, have conducted in-depth research on the significance of promoting the Party and National Flags. In addition to revealing part of the significance in the published promotional declaration, we have specifically excerpted three suggestions from the original submission to Chairman Chiang, and respectfully ask all of you who have graced us with your presence today for your guidance. After finishing the speech, the banquet concluded and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e115">How Many Modern Young Masters Are Defrauding Merchants of Goods? Dissolute Habits Leads to Indulgence in Wine and Women, "Hiding a Beauty in a Golden House" Causes Loss of Character <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the modern young master who owed huge sums of money for goods from fifteen merchants caused a stir in society. After evading responsibility, the merchants posted a public notice. His father, Yan Jingyi (the head of the modern young master Yan Minfu's family), came forward to deal with the matter, attracting the attention of the public. Unexpectedly, a similar incident involving a certain modern young master (name withheld) occurred a few days ago. The young master went to Shunxing Company, a "Bed King" located in the east of Edward Road, Guangxi Road, and purchased a large number of modern chrome-plated low beds from the person in charge, Shao Yongnan. The style was completely beautified, and he also requested a batch of dozens of famous Fujian rattan mats from the Jianfeng store in the Xilin Lane of Jaxi Road. He then presented an on-demand check from a certain bank to pay for the goods. Later, when he took the check to a certain bank to withdraw the money, he dispatched his partner Wang Kexi to deliver the goods. Unexpectedly, the bank balance was insufficient, and the check was returned. Shao was furious as the goods had already left the store, and went to the young master's mansion, only to find that it had been secretly moved. He was extremely displeased. His colleagues were also surprised. According to Shao's detailed investigation, those familiar with the young master said that he had recently been willful and unrestrained, indulging in the pleasures of wine and women, and frequenting brothels, spending money like dirt. Recently, his assets have been declining daily, which is very painful. Therefore, the young master's finances have been greatly stressed. He disregards his credit and is even "hiding a beauty in a golden house", sacrificing his personality. It is said that Shao is now taking steps to investigate his whereabouts in order to negotiate.</p>

Externally, tax evasion and smuggling are becoming increasingly rampant. It is an extraordinary period for our industry and commerce. In this difficult situation, it is difficult to turn the tide without long-term talent planning. You have deep knowledge and are well-versed in the industry, enough to guide industry and commerce to the safety of the rock and eliminate the locusts. We send this letter to extend our congratulations and wish you well."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Match United Company to be Established Next Week; Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers to Inspect North China <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, a joint production and sales general office will be formed by Chinese match manufacturers and Japanese match factories in various parts of China. This was vigorously promoted by leading figures in the Chinese and Japanese match industries, Liu Hongsheng, Longchuan, and Ueda, and realized after being supported by all Chinese and Japanese match manufacturers. The joint venture's capital is set at 5 million yuan, with the Chinese side contributing 75%, accounting for 3.75 million yuan of the total, and the Japanese side contributing 25%, accounting for 1.25 million yuan of the total. Currently, this capital is allocated among Chinese and Japanese factories according to their original capital ratio, with many factories subscribing to shares. The Da Zhonghua Match Factory in this city holds 20% of the total shares, so the joint venture's capital has already been fully subscribed.</p>
<p>Inspect North China A national match united company jointly formed by Chinese and Japanese businesses has been actively progressing on various tasks since its organizational preparation. To understand the current situation of manufacturers in Pingjin and Qingdao, the Chinese side has specifically dispatched representatives Xu Zhiyi and Liu Qinghe, and the Japanese side representative Ueda, who jointly went to North China for inspection in mid-last month. They are also planning to establish branch offices in Tianjin (North China region) and Qingdao (Lu-Yu region). According to the Ta Kung Pao reporter's investigation, the group of Chinese and Japanese manufacturers' representatives has completed their inspection and will return to Shanghai tomorrow to report.</p>
<p>To be Established Next Week The capital for the Sino-Japanese joint match production and sales company has long been raised, and all articles of association and business regulations have also been drafted. They will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record after being approved by the founding meeting. As for the board seats, the Chinese side will get six-tenths, and the Japanese side will get four-tenths. The general manager will also be appointed by the Chinese side, and two deputy general managers will be appointed, one from the Chinese side and one from the Japanese side. Internally, there will be departments for general affairs, statistics, investigation, production, sales, and auditing.</p>
<p>Adopting Control A Ta Kung Pao reporter also learned from reliable sources that after the establishment of the joint head office, all Chinese and Japanese match manufacturers' rights to production and sales will be managed by the company in a controlled manner. Prices will be unified by grade, and both parties will be restricted from adding new factories. Only member manufacturers of the joint company will be able to enjoy business rights, and their sales will be restricted. The business volume between China and Japan will be determined according to the capital, with Chinese merchants accounting for about seven-tenths and Japanese merchants accounting for about three-tenths.</p>
<p>American Business Exits There were rumors that the American-owned Swedish American Micron Match Factory would also join the joint venture and combine its business. However, the Ta Kung Pao reporter learned that due to unresolved negotiation conditions, the Japanese side also expressed little support for the American business joining. Therefore, this proposal was implicitly dismissed. The American business also voluntarily withdrew because the terms of the joint production and sales were too harsh. However, the investigation showed that the scope of the American match factory's market share in China is gradually shrinking, which has no major impact on the prospects of the joint venture.</p>

<p>The Tongmeng News Agency reported from Shanghai on the 2nd that a delegation of seven members of the Kasumi Club, a visiting group of diplomatic news reporters, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru and is expected to arrive on the 5th.

<p>Towing Stranded Vessels The Fengpu Wheel of the Sanbei Company has been stranded in the middle of the Three Mountains in Nanjing for six days. The Songpu Wheel was initially sent to tow it, but it was unsuccessful and also became stranded. The company received a telegram from the owner of the Fengpu Wheel yesterday, stating that the Jiangyu Wheel of the China Merchants Bureau was used to tow it, but the first attempt was still unsuccessful. However, the water gauge has now been measured, showing sixteen feet on the outside and only ten feet on the inside. It has been decided to wait for the high tide this morning (3rd) and hope to rescue it. The Songpu Wheel was fully loaded with coal from Tongzibao to Zhenjiang (not transporting salt). The Changxing Wheel was used to tow it, but because the Songpu Wheel was drawing too much water, it was stranded even more severely and could not be moved. The shipowner telegraphed back and forth with the Shanghai company, and as a result, it was decided to send a large barge to the Three Mountains to unload 500 tons of coal to Nanjing, and then lighten the Songpu Wheel's draft and send a ship to rescue it and tow it out of the shallows.</p>
<p>Tongli Wheel Rushed by Waves The Tongli Wheel of the Tianjin Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 2,260 tons, was heading to Haizhou to load salt. The ship was anchored at Lvzikou when it suddenly encountered a storm and huge waves. The Tongli Wheel was washed onto the beach by the wind and waves and became stranded. Finally, due to the force of the huge waves, it broke free from the beach. However, the ship's wire rope was broken, and the horizontal bar of the anchor was also broken. According to the shipowner's report yesterday, whether the hull was damaged is still unclear and will be known after inspection.</p>

<p>Since taking office, Lu Yimei, the new President of the Shanghai Local Court, has been determined to rectify court affairs. In addition to instructing all staff members to practice integrity, he also stated that Chairman Chiang's implementation of the New Life Movement and keeping time are the top priorities for civil servants. Currently, it is the summer break, and the court is open from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The official business is heavy, and the time is short. If time is not kept, the cases will be affected, which is unthinkable. Therefore, he takes the lead by arriving at the office at 6:00 AM and personally sits at the check-in desk. All judges and staff members must check in and work before 7:00 AM. Those who are late will be refused entry and treated as late arrivals, and will be punished. Therefore, all staff members are cautious and self-motivated, showing a new atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Federation held an executive committee meeting at the Local Association yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Huang Renzhi, Zai Xingyi, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Huikang, Wang Xingyao, Jiang Junyi, Pan Yangyao, and Sun Daosheng. The meeting was chaired by Hu Xiyuan. First, Huang Renzhi of the General Affairs Group reported on the work done in the past six months and solicited opinions from various national product manufacturers on the work that the association should do. Subsequently, Wang Xingyao of the Domestic Group and Zhang Huikang of the Foreign Group reported on the work of their respective groups. The following resolutions were passed: Invite principals of primary, secondary, and high schools to the Youth Association at 3:00 PM on the 4th of this month to request them to have their students promote national products during the summer vacation. Organize inspection teams to various places along the Yangtze River. A women's national product association will be established on a regular basis. The China Yapuer Electric Appliance Factory sent a letter stating that there are currently four brands of foreign merchants' light bulbs. Initially, they came from Europe and the United States, but now they are jointly manufactured in Shanghai. One of them is a second-rate product among the three, which is being sold at a reduced price, which hinders the sale of national product light bulbs. The association will wait for the Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association to extract the trademarks and brands of national product light bulbs before handling the case. The association believes that the issue of smuggling is serious in terms of national economy and people's livelihood. During the temporary proposal, it conducted a lengthy and detailed discussion and formulated various methods.</p>

Therefore, they initiated a meeting of savings depositors, scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month at the Third District Party Headquarters on the north embankment of the Dog Queen Palace Bridge, to discuss the progress method together.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Pioneer in the Transportation Industry; Huang Zhongwen Returns from the United States After Studying; He Will Make Novel Contributions to the Domestic Transportation Industry <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Huashang Public Bus Company, the only transportation hub in Zhabei, has been established for many years and has made great contributions to the society and the people. Mr. Huang Zhongwen, the general manager of the company, lived overseas in his early years and helped the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in his revolutionary work. When the foundation of the Republic of China was established, he retired to become a businessman. After Huang founded the Huashang Company, all the plans were implemented step by step. Although the scale was slightly inferior to that of the British company, the internal organization was more rigorous and thorough than any other company. The business has been booming in the past three years, and Huang's ambition to make progress has never been slackened. Last year, he made a special trip to the United States to study the various evolutions of the transportation industry, which lasted for more than half a year. He completed his great mission the day before yesterday and returned with a wealth of novel knowledge about the transportation industry, which he will gradually realize and make great contributions to the society and the country. According to Mr. Huang, he has successively inspected more than 30 transportation hubs in various cities. There are as many as ten kinds of the latest invented cars that save fuel or increase speed. Among them, the most valuable is the three-tire car (recently invented by the Seattle Cebopin Company), which saves 50% more gasoline than the same car, and the price is surprisingly cheap, only half the price of the same-sized car. It can also be said to be an amazing discovery in the transportation industry. He has signed an operating rights contract with the company. If the environment permits, he will set up manufacturing or sales agencies to help the domestic transportation construction. Other examples include sleeper double-decker cars, and cars that use "gasoline vapor" as fuel, which can also save 50%, but are not easy to store.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Nanjing Road; The Citizens' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Bureau Requesting a Refund of Overpaid House Tax for Member Stores <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Citizens' First District Branch sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday on behalf of its member stores, Taikang Company, Zhonghua Photo Studio, Hongxiang Company, and Shanghai Old Goods Store, requesting a refund of overpaid tax. The original letter is excerpted as follows: We would like to inform you that we have recently received a joint letter from our member stores, Taikang Company, Zhonghua Photo Studio, Hongxiang Company, and Shanghai Old Goods Store on Nanjing Road, stating that our company has been renting houses on Nanjing Road. Last year, we requested the landlords to reduce the rent, which was approved by the landlords and implemented from April of last year. The Public Works Bureau's collection of house tax has always been based on the amount of rent. Since the rent has been reduced, the house tax should of course be reduced proportionally. However, at that time, in order to negotiate a rent reduction with the landlords, we were afraid that it would take time and hinder the tax collection, so when the Public Works Bureau collected the house tax, we still paid according to the amount before the reduction. However, we stated that if there was any overpayment after the rent reduction issue was resolved, we would request a refund or deduction. Later, the rent reduction issue was resolved. We have repeatedly requested the Tax Collection Office to refund the overpaid tax, but they only agreed to reduce the tax collection from January of this year. They refused to accept the amount that should have been reduced for the summer, autumn, and winter seasons of last year, totaling nine months. Now, our companies, except for Taikang Company, which has already paid the house tax for this year, are still waiting for the refund of the overpaid amount for the summer, autumn, and winter seasons of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Hongxiang and others have requested that the past overpaid amount be used to offset the tax to save procedures. However, we recently received a serious warning from the Public Works Bureau, requiring us to clear the unpaid tax in full before July 4th, otherwise they will file a public lawsuit. It is justifiable for our companies to request that the overpaid amount be used to offset the tax, and it is not comparable to resisting tax payment. There is no reason to file a public lawsuit. We hereby urge your association to uphold justice and appeal to the Public Works Bureau to uphold justice and maintain the hardship of merchants. We found that in the 24th year of the Republic of China last year, the Jicheng Pharmacy at No. 166 Nanjing Road also temporarily paid the tax because the rent reduction issue had not been resolved. Later, the rent was reduced, and on September 26 of the same year, it received a notice from the Tax Collection Office of your bureau to refund the overpaid tax. The case of Taikang Company and others is the same, and should be considered. We hope that you will investigate and deal with it in accordance with the previous case, and please reply.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration, considering that the First and Second Special District Prisons in this city are small and insufficient to accommodate prisoners, and that the Jiangsu Second Branch Prison on North Zhejiang Road and the Special Second Detention Center on Xuehuali Road are poorly equipped, spent money two years ago to purchase hundreds of acres of land in Beixinjing, Pusong District, Shanghai West, to build a huge prison, intending to move the convicted prisoners of the First and Second Special District Courts to the new prison, and convert the original two prisons into detention centers. Because the new prison has been under construction for a long time, it has now been completed one after another. On the 28th of last month, it instructed the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to order the Special Second Prison and Detention Center to move the prisoners in custody to the new prison starting from the 1st of this month, and move the unconvicted persons in the detention center to the original Special Second Prison. Sun Xiong, the warden of the Special Second Prison, will temporarily concurrently serve as the head of the detention center, and Jiang Fengyi, the former head of the Special Second Detention Center, will be reassigned as a prison official. Sun and Jiang were ordered to start transferring and detaining all convicted and unconvicted persons separately from 3:00 PM on the 1st. The name of the new prison is the Second Prison directly under the Ministry of Judicial Administration. It is heard that the Special First Prison and the Jiangsu Second Branch Prison will also begin to move, but the staff of the Special Second Detention Center, including 60 detention center personnel, have not received orders from the Ministry and do not know whether they will be dismissed. The Special Second Warden, who is also the head of the detention center, has telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions. Before receiving orders from the Ministry, they will continue to provide food and lodging every day.</p>

<p>Zheng Shiyue, a woman from Ningbo, currently 20 years old and possessing some beauty, was married to Gu Chengda, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker on the 4th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar in the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. Later, Zheng worked as a saleswoman for the British American Tobacco Company, earning a monthly salary of approximately 70-80 yuan. Due to her work, around September of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], she met Chen Mingxun (age 30), a native of Haiyan and owner of the Rixin Chang Foreign Goods Store at No. 29, Lane 240, Avenue Edward VII. At that time, Chen used all sorts of enticements and exploited his power to force himself upon her, and they had relations at the Nanjing Hotel. Because Zheng already had a husband, Chen Mingxun instigated her to separate from her husband, claiming that he himself was unmarried and that if she divorced, he would marry her. Zheng believed him, and she negotiated a divorce with Gu Chengda. As a result, on December 26th of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], they signed a divorce agreement, with lawyer Huang Xiuqi as the witness. The condition was that Zheng would pay Gu 360 yuan to settle the matter. After Zheng Shiyue achieved her goal of divorce, she cohabited with Chen at No. 1, Derun Lane, Rue Luson, and No. 1370, Avenue Edward VII, and Chen gave Zheng 300 yuan per month for living expenses. However, after cohabiting for many months, Chen never indicated any intention to marry Zheng Shiyue. Despite her urging, Chen always procrastinated. This spring, Chen suddenly changed, finding another love and becoming disgusted with Zheng. He even stopped paying for living expenses. Zheng Shiyue then hired lawyer Wang Liangqing and filed a lawsuit against Chen in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing him of seduction and abandonment, requesting that he be punished according to the first half of Article 240, Section 2, and Article 239 of the Criminal Law, and additionally requesting Chen Mingxun to pay 300 yuan per month for living expenses until she reached the age of 60, totaling 144,000 yuan in national currency. Yesterday afternoon, judge Huang Daxi of the First Special Court opened the Fifth Criminal Court for a hearing. Because the summons for Chen Mingxun could not be delivered, only Zheng Shiyue was questioned, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<p>Ni Heting, a native of Ningbo, is blind in one eye and works as a fortune teller. He has a daughter named Yunmei, who is only sixteen years old and also blind in one eye. His son-in-law, Fu Atang, is also blind. Moreover, the father-in-law and son-in-law share the same profession. However, only half a month after Fu married Yunmei on May 30th of this year, a comic scene of "a blind man catching an adulterer" occurred. Now, according to Ni Heting, the girl's father, he has filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, stating that Qiu Hongkui, a fellow villager residing at No. 307, Yuezhou Road, suddenly broke into his son-in-law's house at 9:00 PM on the 17th of last month and raped his daughter Yunmei. He has cited his daughter and son-in-law as witnesses, requesting an investigation. Yesterday afternoon, judge Zhong Qing opened a court session and summoned the plaintiff, defendant, and witnesses Fu Atang and Ni Yunmei, a total of four people. Only Qiu's eyes were unharmed. The Ni father and daughter still had one eye that could see. The summons was brought to the court with the support of his father-in-law. According to the testimony, when Qiu was raping his wife, he happened to return from outside and heard his wife panting. He entered the room to question her, but Qiu, thinking he was blind, tried to escape. Although he was blind in eye, he was not blind in heart. He listened to the footsteps and guessed that the person was Qiu. He immediately grabbed him and so on. However, Qiu claimed that the plaintiff and others were making false accusations because they had failed to borrow money. Judge Zhong declared that the case was related to public morals and required a detailed investigation, so he announced that the hearing was closed to the public.</p>

<p>The Xin Ning Shao steamer, operated by the Ning Shao Company on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 3:00 PM on the 29th of last month. That evening, a passenger resembling a person of upper class, about fifty years old, boarded the cabin No. 69 in the second-class section of the ship. Unexpectedly, when the ship docked at Zhenhai at 5:00 AM the next morning, he was nowhere to be found. It was clear that he had either jumped into the sea or accidentally fallen overboard. His berth was searched, and the gray-white Indian silk long gown, white spun silk short shirt and pants, shoes, and hat that the passenger had worn before going to bed were all left on the berth. At the same time, there was also a small leather wallet, a silver watch, keys, along with several Shaoxing Post Office remittance slips. Upon inspection of the remittance slips, the names of the remitters were all "Shi Songfu," with the address being the Shaoxing District Court. Therefore, it was speculated that the passenger was working at the Shaoxing District Court, and Wang Songfu was likely his name. The aforementioned belongings were sent to the Ning Shao Ningbo Bureau by the purser after the ship arrived in Ningbo the next day and are being kept there, awaiting family members to claim them.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan was detained in the sick ward outside Guangci Hospital on suspicion of inciting murder. During the appeal period, he bribed the guards Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai (brothers) and Wang Yushou to incite the plaintiff Zhao Guangfu and others to retract their statements. After the incident, both Mas and Wang escaped simultaneously. The Procuratorate of the Second Special Court discovered that Ma Xianxiang, a guard at the Second Special Court Detention Center (a cousin of the other guards), was also involved in accepting bribes and inciting the retraction of statements. On February 28th of this year, Ma Xianxiang was detained and prosecuted along with Gu Zhuxuan and his brother Gu Songmao. The trial has not yet concluded. Now that Ma Xianxiang is in detention, he learned that Gu Zhuxuan's murder case has been declared not guilty by the High Court Third Branch after the appeal trial. He filed a petition with the Second Special Court a few days ago, requesting a stay of detention. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Li Changnian, who is presiding over the case, came to the Second Criminal Court and ordered Ma Xianxiang to be brought to court. He instructed that the case has not yet been concluded, and because the wanted criminal Ma Xianxiang and others are still at large, your petition for bail is granted. You must find a reliable business to guarantee that you will be available whenever summoned, and you are not allowed to leave Shanghai during the bail period. Ma listened to the instructions and repeatedly agreed. The official ordered the bailiff to take Ma down and return him to custody, pending the submission of the bail bond for verification.</p>

<p>Song Xihou, a native of Yuyao residing at No. 10, Sida Village, Rue Remy, French Concession, who had previously served as a comprador at the Shanghai office of the British Helig Linen Yarn Company, was suddenly shot to death by two thugs in suits at his home at noon on the 8th of last month. The maid Du Chen was also shot and killed, and Song's concubine, Shao, and another maid, Yuan Xie, were also injured and are still being treated in the hospital. On the 18th of the same month, the French Concession police found that Zhou Bincai, a native of Ningbo who had previously worked as a servant at Song's house and is now a tea house accountant at the New World, was suspected of inciting the murder. Zhou was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court came to the Second Criminal Court and brought Zhou to court for a continued trial. The victim's wife, Song Luo, and daughter, Song Meizhen, came to court and testified successively about the deceased and the defendant having no feud and the circumstances of the murder. When Zhou Baocai was questioned, he vehemently denied inciting the murder. The court verified the testimony and, because the case still required investigation, announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the morning of the 13th. The defendant remained in custody.</p>

<p>Citizen Han Qixiang, also known as Han Jintu, reported to the Municipal Government that Ye Changfu, the second-level technician of the Land Bureau, and Zhang Zhenfan, a technical assistant, deliberately included a highway in the land certificate exchange case for the citizen's property and that a certain Tao had contacted him for extortion. The Land Bureau transferred the case to the District Court for legal proceedings. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened a hearing to continue the trial. The two defendants hired lawyers to appear in court and argued that, according to the defendants' statements, the old highway base within Han Qixiang's land should be subject to increased taxation, which was a decision made during the tenure of former bureau chiefs Jin and Cai. The defendants had no authority to approve or reject it. The reason for Han's accusation was due to the instigation of colleague Wang Jiqing. Wang and Han had previously colluded to defraud Chen Musen in a certificate exchange case and had interceded with the defendants, who told them to negotiate with the director themselves. Wang harbored resentment and caused today's incident, and so on. At this point, the judge asked Han Qixiang, "You said that you first discussed the bribe at the Yile Tian Teahouse and then contacted them at the Quanxing Kang Hotel. Why couldn't the waiters be summoned? What were the names of the waiters?" Han replied that when the bailiffs of this court went to summon the waiters that day, the Quanxing Kang waiter happened to be out, and he could not remember the name of the Yile Tian waiter. The judge stated that since the defendants had presented evidence, the files from the Land Bureau should be retrieved for further verification. The case was postponed for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Yang Zhongfen Case Continued Yesterday – Two Witnesses to Be Summoned to Testify in Court – Child Sent for Forensic Examination and Re-Trialed <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zhongfen, a Fujianese secretary and director of a certain bank, was accused by Liu Huizhen, a former prostitute from the Meiyu Brothel, in the First Special District Court of abandoning her and their son Ali. The court has summoned them several times, and all details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing opened the Second Criminal Court for a continued hearing. The summoned witnesses, including Mao Juqing, a female intern at the Kemmei Maternity Hospital, and Jin Fengsheng, the second landlord at No. A-29, Shengdali, Avenue Notre Dame, were to be summoned to court. First, Mao testified that Yang Zhongfen accompanied Liu Huizhen to register and give birth at the hospital. When she and Dr. Zhou Jiaying went to deliver the baby, they also saw Yang present. When she bathed the baby, she also saw Yang at the scene, and she saw him once more afterwards. At that time, the registration book was written with Yang's residence. Then, Jin Fengsheng testified that she had seen the plaintiff Liu Huizhen when she was in the brothel, and when she rented the house later, she was out, so she did not know who rented it. Although Yang Zhongfen came occasionally, she did not know if he spent the night. She did not know whether the child was born to the defendant, or whether the plaintiff's living expenses were paid by the defendant. However, other than the defendant, she did not see anyone else visit the plaintiff. The court then questioned the plaintiff about the circumstances of renting the house, and questioned the defendant Yang Zhongfen, who still denied that Ali was his son. The court examined the photos of Yang given to the plaintiff and the photos of the child and found that their faces were very similar. The court then issued an order for Yang to admit it, but Yang claimed that they did not look alike. Judge Zhong, in order to clarify the truth, decided that the case would be heard again after Ali was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A Wife Who Has Been on the Run for Nine Years – Suddenly Caught by Her Own Husband – Han Changhua Accidentally Encounters His Wife – Han Shen and Lu Xueshan Both Confess <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Han Changhua, a native of Funing, 46 years old, has been working as a sand loader at the wharf in the Nanshi district. Due to the hardship of life, he is away from home all year round. His wife, Shen (43 years old, from Huaicheng), lives in the countryside. At first, they were at peace, but later, because she was not used to sleeping alone, she had an affair with Lu Xueshan (47 years old), a native of Funing who was a cement broker. Because of their passionate affair, he instigated the concubine to abscond from their hometown with clothing and more than 200 yuan in cash last month and live together in a rented house at No. 907, Li Ma Road, Nanshi, living like a married couple. After learning that his wife had been abducted and ran away, Han Changhua searched everywhere without success. Yesterday afternoon at around 10:00 PM, Han and his friends Liu Xueyou (42 years old, from Funing) and Ye Dongjue (25 years old, from Wuxing) were on Dongjiadu Street in Nanshi when they caught a glimpse of Lu Xueshan and his wife walking together. They stepped forward and grabbed them. They reported to the police officer Liu Wenjin at the post, who brought the plaintiff and defendants to the Dongjiadu Police Station for questioning. According to the defendant Lu Xueshan, he had been having an affair with Shen for nine years and admitted to abducting her to Shanghai. When Han Shen was questioned, she confessed to absconding with clothing and cash and cohabiting with Lu. The director of the police station, considering the case to be related to adultery and the possession of another man's wife, sent both parties to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Wang Caigen, Who Had Flights of Fancy – Used Corrosive Liquid to Disfigure His Wife – Declared That the Reason Was Not About New Clothes <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Wang Caigen, a coppersmith from Ningbo, and his wife Wang Bao lived together at No. 14, Jinxing Lane, Avenue Edward VII. At 5:40 AM the day before yesterday, Wang got up and asked his wife to take out a newly made piece of clothing. When she tried it on, it did not fit, which led to an argument. Wang Bao left in anger. Unexpectedly, her husband Wang Caigen secretly followed behind her. Suddenly, he poured a bottle of corrosive liquid on her, causing injuries to her face and chest. The western police officer No. 183 found out about it and sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment and took Wang Caigen, along with the remaining bottle of corrosive liquid, to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station prosecuted him for the crime of grievous bodily harm under Article 278 of the Criminal Law, stating that according to the defendant's confession at the police station, his wife was unfaithful and did not return home all night. He had reported this to the police station on May 5th (with a record). The night before last, she did not return home all night. Therefore, he poured corrosive liquid on her. The victim is still in the hospital. He requested that the hearing be postponed. When the defendant Wang Caigen was questioned, he confessed that he poured corrosive liquid on her because his wife was unfaithful, intending to disfigure her so that she could stay at home and not go out, and it was not about the clothes. Judge Tan ordered Wang to be detained and reheard in seven days.</p>

<p>Shanghai's Southern Goods Industry (Continued) Compiled by China Credit Bureau</p>
<p>(Thirty of the Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>8. Business Overview</p>
<p>The Southern Goods industry is involved in the sale of food items. Because of its wide variety, it can also be called a food department store. Therefore, its business scope is quite broad. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, there were nearly three million residents in Shanghai who came from other provinces. Agriculture was thriving, prices were low, the social economy was abundant, and the money lending industry was relaxed. Anyone who operated this business and had a certain reputation could obtain loans even if they lacked capital. In addition to providing working capital, money lending businesses also provided long-term loans. Therefore, the economy was very smooth, and the business of extending credit also expanded accordingly. The Southern Goods and Exchange industry extended credit, and accounting was settled during the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Lunar New Year, known as the three festivals. After settlement, credit was extended again, and the loans had to be repaid in February or March of the following year. As a result, the business developed greatly. Small Southern Goods stores in towns within 200 li of the city all did business with the Southern Goods Exchange industry in this city. The annual business volume reached 2.7 million yuan, and there were many profits. Therefore, more than 200 companies in the same industry sprang up, which was the golden age of the industry.</p>
<p>In the last ten years, because various parts of the country have been plagued by natural disasters and foreign invasions, the rural economy has gone bankrupt. Furthermore, the Northeast was lost, and the Shanghai war caused severe damage. Domestic industry and commerce are exhausted, the economic panic is increasingly profound, purchasing power is weak, and business has sharply declined. The money lending industry has also become increasingly tight, so those who were unable to maintain their businesses, including the well-known Nan San Mao, Bei San Mao, Xin Tai Sheng, Lao Tai Sheng, and Hong Tai, all successively closed down. Many other companies with weak financial strength have also collapsed. According to people in the industry, the business volume of this industry in recent years is only 40% to 50% of its peak period.</p>
<p>Business Investigation</p>
<p>The Southern Goods industry has a wide scope, and the number of businesses in the same industry has increased daily. There are also distinctions between different provincial guilds. Therefore, its business is scattered. Later, in order to seek the development of business and resolve disputes, the Zhejiang guild first proposed the establishment of Chun Ze Tang in the Guangxu years as a trade association. However, it still maintained private opinions and sought to maintain balance. The Ningbo guild then established Yong Xing Hui, and the local Shanghai guild also established Chong Yi Tang to handle their respective affairs. Chun Ze Tang is located in Tangfang Lane outside Xiaonantou and was established the earliest. In the third year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Southern and Northern Goods Exchange Industry Trade Association. It has considerable real estate and abundant funds. Only 17 members are from both the southern and northern markets, and all other businesses in the same industry and new businesses are not allowed to join. It has a monopoly nature. Chong Yi Tang is located on Ninghe Road in the western part of the city and has been established for more than 30 years. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Southern Goods Industry Trade Association. Yong Xing Hui merged into Chong Yi Tang in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, with more than 100 members. However, funds are depleted and income does not cover expenses.</p>
<p>According to investigations, there are only more than 220 businesses in the same industry in this city today. Among them, more than 100 are called major businesses (i.e., members of the association) and have the right to directly purchase goods from the market. Half of those who have not joined the association are sold by Shi He Da Tong Hang (i.e., members of the association) in wholesale or sold to the Southern and Northern Goods Exchange industry. The business names of each company are listed below:</p>
<p>Chun Ze Tang Public Office—i.e., Southern and Northern Goods Exchange Trade Association, with 17 members in total:</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>According to Li Cao, the party concerned, after reading the news item titled "Daughter-in-Law Accuses Father-in-Law" on page 15 of the fourth section of the Shen Bao on July 2, the content is all one-sided and contains many inaccuracies. The small-print headline "Addicted to Gambling and Violating Family Rules" is deliberately defamatory, which is deeply regrettable. It is found that because Ms. Li Cao could not bear the abuse of her mother-in-law, her father, Lan Bin, and her father-in-law, Li Hong, agreed that her father-in-law would provide her with a monthly living allowance of 80 yuan to allow her to live separately. Over the years, they have been getting along well. Unexpectedly, starting in March of this year, her father-in-law suddenly stopped the monthly allowance. After unsuccessful attempts to persuade him, she had no choice but to take her children to beg him. However, he treated them as strangers and drove them out. Having reached the end of the road and having no way to compromise, she had no choice but to seek legal relief. The report in the newspaper is clearly not the truth. Please send a letter to the newspaper to correct the facts and clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Bao Zhihui</p>

<p>World Games Delegation Passed Through Singapore Yesterday</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Special Correspondent, Singapore, 2nd) The Chinese World Games delegation arrived in Singapore this morning on the Conte Verde. The delegation will continue westward on the same ship this afternoon.</p>
<p>Zhong Yong Sen Went to Sichuan Last Night, Xi Qiao Sheng Flies to Sichuan on Saturday, Football Prospects in Sichuan are Promising</p>
<p>With the advocacy of enthusiastic individuals, sports in Sichuan Province are showing a vigorous atmosphere. Fan Shao Zeng, the commander of the Fourth Division of the Twenty-first Army, has been the strongest advocate. Since Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin arrived in Sichuan, tennis in Sichuan Province has greatly improved. This time, Mr. Fan and Qian Yaobin came to Shanghai on official business to promote football in Sichuan. They obtained the consent of two strong players, Zhong Yongsen and Xi Qiaosheng, to work in Sichuan and promote football in their spare time. Qian Zhong has already taken the Minquan ship to Sichuan last night. Xi is scheduled to fly to Wuhan on Saturday to meet with Qian and others and go to Sichuan together. Mr. Fan himself is said to have returned to Sichuan by plane on Monday.</p>
<p>National Arts Athletes, Life on the Ship</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The National Arts Delegation to the World Games boarded the Conte Verde in Shanghai on the 26th and left the country. That night, manager Hao Mingjun gathered all the team members and stipulated that during the voyage, they would train in group Taijiquan exercises on the deck from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM every morning and practice various paired boxing and weapons routines. This began the next day (27th). However, the national arts team members were traveling abroad for the first time and were not accustomed to the sea voyage and the ship's swaying. Therefore, they felt somewhat uncomfortable with life. The exercises made them feel even more dizzy. By the second training session on the morning of the 28th, the team members had gradually become accustomed to the sea voyage and became more interested and energetic. At 2:00 PM, the ship arrived in Hong Kong and responded to the grand send-off party held by the Hong Kong China Northern Athletic Association. Swimming representatives Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong boarded the ship that evening. They were very interested in the national arts team's weapons routines. There is something worth reporting to the national arts comrades in Shanghai, namely, that the sports community has always been somewhat indifferent to the national arts and has different views. This time, everyone gathered on the same ship and spent time together day and night. Everyone gradually recognized the subtleties of the national arts and gained the sympathy of the majority. The national arts team members also deeply felt the importance of this trip. Therefore, they immersed themselves in hard practice during the journey, constantly exceeding the scheduled practice time several times over, in order to give the people of all countries in the world a great stimulus at the spiritual mountain meeting and to show China's inherent martial spirit. After the ship leaves Hong Kong, all the team members will organize a entertainment show to be held in the ship's music hall. On the eve of arrival in Singapore, there will be a grand occasion. The voyage is expected to arrive in Singapore on the morning of the 2nd.</p>

<p>Nan Shang Dong Da Zhong Da Physical Education Department Alumni Association, Elects Jiang Xiangqing as Standing Director</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Alumni Association of the Physical Education Department of Nan Gao Dong Da Zhong Da was formally established on June 28. Previously, the newspaper reported on various details. It is now known that the association has elected Jiang Xiangqing as a standing director, Zhang Yuansheng and Wang Fudan as directors, and Li Jiyuan as secretary and accountant. Yu Jinxiang, Zhang Yuansheng, and Shi Longyun have been recommended as representatives to attend the annual meeting of the Alumni Association General Association. It is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 6th of this month, where important issues will be raised.</p>
<p>On Board the Conte Verde, En Route from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Sent by Yi Qin, Newspaper Correspondent Accompanying the Delegation</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper: The Chinese World Games delegation, consisting of more than 110 people, boarded the Italian mail ship Conte Verde at noon on June 26. After saying goodbye to the well-wishers from various groups at the Zhaoshang Wharf amidst enthusiastic cheers, the journey was smooth and the weather was sunny and refreshing. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 28th, they safely arrived in Hong Kong. The life at sea of the delegation members attending the World Games on behalf of our country is full of interest and must be of concern to the people of the country. Therefore, I have to write it down.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, the team members ran around looking for their cabins. Because the staff members lived in second-class cabins, and the athletes and inspection team members lived in second-class economy cabins, they were separated from each other, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, many athletes could not enter through the same door after boarding the ship, which was also an interesting thing.</p>
<p>The food on the ship is Italian style. Although it is not particularly good, it is still rich and edible. Each day is divided into three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as a tea break. The team members slept comfortably and ate well, so there is a tendency to become fat, which is indeed a major problem.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM on the 27th, a plenary meeting of the delegation was held in the first-class cabin's music room. Shen Siliang chaired the meeting and reported on the expectations for this trip abroad. He urged all team members not to neglect small personal matters because personal actions represent the group. Therefore, every word and action must be paid attention to in order to show an organized performance to outsiders. If there are any unsatisfactory matters, opinions can be submitted to the team managers, and private discussions should be avoided. Everyone must unite sincerely and hope that those with problems regarding their professional qualifications will honestly report themselves to avoid being pointed out by people from other countries, which would damage the national image.</p>
<p>Various committees were established to manage life at sea. There are four types:</p>
<p>Training Committee: Ma Yuehan (Chairman), Dong Shouyi, Xu Minhui, Hao Ming, Ye Liang (regarding athletes' practice, etc.)</p>
<p>Speech Committee: Yuan Dunli (Chairman), Gao Zi, Wu Wei (regarding discussions on German and Western etiquette, etc.)</p>
<p>Entertainment Committee: Dong Shouyi (Chairman), Wu Bangwei, Zhao Wenzao, Qian Yiqin, Wang Huaiqi, Huang Liming, Shao Rugan (regarding entertainment and social events for the entire delegation, etc.)</p>
<p>Management Committee: Zhou Jiaqi (Chairman), Shi Zhaokang, Shen Kunnan, Song Junfu, Li Youzhen, Li Qingan, Gu Shunhua (regarding all matters related to the delegation's affairs)</p>
<p>Starting from the second day (27th), a small number of athletes have begun to practice on the deck. Weightlifting representatives Huang Sheji, Shen Liang, Weng Kangting, and Zhai Lianyuan (national arts) and Li Sen are the most active. In addition to practicing, most of the other athletes play chess to entertain themselves. Among the team members, only Xu Yingchao suffered from seasickness, and Jiang Lianggui was unwell due to a cold. The rest were full of energy as usual.</p>
<p>World Games Organizing Committee Receives Olympic Village, Winter World Games Heavily in Deficit</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 1st: The organizing committee of the Eleventh Olympic Games has formally received the "Olympic Village" as a residence for male athletes from various countries, with a capacity of more than 5,000 people. After the end of the Games, it will be returned to Germany. At the reception ceremony held by the government today, German military and civilian authorities, as well as the athlete teams from Japan, Australia, and Argentina, who have already arrived here, all came to visit, creating a grand scene.</p>
<p>Havas, Seng City, 1st: After the Olympic Winter Games held in Gamisch City in February this year, the various income and expenditure accounts have been settled. The total expenditure was 2,681,000 marks (originally set at 1,000,000 marks), and the total income was 2,415,368 marks. The difference was 65,632 marks, which has been allocated by the government.</p>

<p>People all know that Li Lili's first film in the film industry was Sun Yu's directed "Volcano Love Blood." In fact, long before "Volcano Love Blood," she had already appeared on camera at the Guanghua Film Company in Beiping.</p>
<p>Sun Yu, a Sichuan native, studied at Nankai in Tianjin and Tsinghua in Beiping. Before he went to the United States, while still studying at Tsinghua, he began writing film scripts. He once submitted a script to the then Great Wall Film Company.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng studied in an old private school in a Land God Temple in his childhood. It is said that the image of Ge Zuo Zhi from "The Lost Lamb" seeking an old bookstore is no different from the old private school where he studied.

<p>Now, the reason why the adaptation of Shakespeare's works to the screen, such as the performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," has gained unprecedented audiences in the world is not without reason. Last winter, the Soviet Union held a "Shakespeare Congress," and the United States also has an organization for the Shakespeare Annual Meeting. "Romeo and Juliet" is a very popular reading material in the world. MGM plans to put it on the screen, which has been a long time. It was decided that Norma Shearer would be the female lead. At first, it was intended to be shelved because a suitable actor for the male lead could not be found. However, MGM, seeing the success of Warner's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," revived the old plan. Now, MGM has selected Leslie Howard as the male lead, which has been agreed upon by Ms. Shearer, and John Barrymore has taken a supporting role in this film. Its future success is expected to exceed "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Formerly a Waiter at a Dance Hall: Ding Zhenglin Attempts to Rob a Russian and is Arrested; Remaining Thieves Flee Without a Trace; Yesterday Handed Over to the Court for Trial <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>A Russian man,羅巴司道夫 (transliterated), residing at No. 16,培納 Apartments, at the intersection of呂班 Road and麥賽而蒂羅 Road in the French Concession, was suddenly attacked by three Chinese bandits armed with guns at around 6 a.m. the day before yesterday. The bandits broke open the door and rushed in, attempting to rob him. The Russian man, awakened by the noise, discovered that one of the three bandits was Ding Zhenglin, a former waiter from Zhenjiang (age 37) whom he had previously employed. He forcefully subdued Ding and pushed him out of the room, causing a collision with the other two bandits. Seeing that their attempt had failed, the two bandits fled in different directions. However, the bandit with the handgun fired two shots at the wall as a warning. Fortunately, no one was injured. The doorman numbered 491, hired by the apartment building, and police patrolman number 289 from the French police station, hearing the commotion, arrived and arrested Ding. Detective Zhou Bingcheng and investigators Qin Youyu and Wu Wengang interrogated him. According to Ding's confession, he had worked as a waiter at a dance hall at the intersection of馬斯南 Road and震飛 Road. After quitting, he was unemployed. On the night of the 28th of last month, he met a friend, Zhang Faqing, at the Great World amusement park, who invited him to stay at Zhang's house at No. 753民國 Road. There, they planned the robbery. After reaching a decision, Zhang, carrying a handgun, invited an unknown person, and Ding led them to his former employer's house to attempt the robbery. He claimed that Zhang and the other unknown person had fled and he did not know their whereabouts. Yesterday at noon, he was sent to the Special No. 2 Court, Criminal Division 1. Police Department lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, requesting a postponement of the trial because the investigation was not yet complete. Judge Li Changnian reviewed the report, questioned Ding, and ordered a postponement until the 15th to further investigate. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Wu Fengxin, a 24-year-old local resident who deals in foreign goods and lives at No. 13露杳園 Road, was sipping tea on the third floor of a teahouse in the邑廟裏園 (City God Temple Garden) a few days ago when he was inexplicably accosted by a rogue named Gu Jiubao, who gathered several hooligans to extort money from Wu. Gu falsely accused Wu of owing gambling debts. Wu denied the accusation, stating that he did not know Gu. Consequently, Gu and his gang brutally beat and injured Wu. Since he was alone and outnumbered and under surveillance, a member of Gu's gang mediated, and the matter was settled for 69 yuan. Wu paid 19 yuan in cash on the spot and wrote an IOU for the remaining 50 yuan, promising to pay it back within a month. Wu then managed to escape home and sought medical treatment for his injuries. Feeling aggrieved, he filed a report with the邑廟 police station, requesting a thorough investigation and the return of the extorted money. Police Chief Yu summoned Gu Jiubao for questioning yesterday. Gu confessed that he operated a雀牌 (mahjong) parlor. In August of last year, a salesman named Xu Sheng from his parlor sold 26 sets of雀牌 to Wu Fengxin, a purchasing agent at the運勝 foreign firm, for a total of 138 yuan. He had not received any payment. Unexpectedly, the運勝 foreign firm closed down in less than a month. Recently, he happened to see Wu Fengxin in the裏園 and demanded the debt be repaid, which was then mediated. He denied any extortion or assault. The case involves public disturbance and assault causing injury and was transferred to the General Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 11 a.m., four thieves dressed in formal attire, pretending to ask for a letter, broke into the home of Jin Pengling, a Land Bureau employee. They displayed handguns, demanding silence, and began beating Jin and his family, demanding they hand over silver dollars. However, Jin was not intimidated. Seeing that the guns were made of wood, he disregarded them and resisted the thieves. The thieves panicked and, not daring to search the house, fled in a hurry. Jin chased after them. Two of the thieves turned back and pretended to shoot. Jin rushed forward to tackle them and was struck on the right forehead with the fake handgun, causing profuse bleeding. At that moment, police officer Zhang Yuting and others from the文廟 Road post, having heard the alarm, arrived one after another. With the help of passersby, they apprehended one of the thieves, who was wearing a white silk long gown, and seized a fake handgun. Another fake handgun was also recovered on the road. The thief and the two guns were taken to the police station. After questioning by Chief Wen, the thief was identified as Zhang Azhong (age 30). He was handed over to the detective squad for further investigation and to apprehend the remaining gang members. The victim, Jin, was bleeding from his injuries and was sent to a nearby hospital for treatment by another officer.</p>

<p>Zhang Ziliang, a Suzhou native and the teacher of the famous female蘇灘 performer Jiang Wanzhen, was already in his sixties and lacked any means of support. He relied on his student Wanzhen for his daily living. However, on the 27th of last month, Jiang's father, concerned that Zhang was old and frail and might encounter unforeseen circumstances, sent him to the home of Zhang's son-in-law, Jiang Rongqing, at No. 31寶裕坊,成都 Road. Although Zhang was unwilling, he had no choice and could only lament his fate. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, due to this resentment, he suddenly jumped from the window of the front building, committing suicide. He was severely injured in the fall. His son-in-law and others quickly noticed and summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to the hospital. However, medical treatment was ineffective, and he died yesterday morning. The hospital reported the incident to the Chengdu Road police station in the jurisdiction, who ordered detective Zhang Peilan to investigate. The body was then taken to the斐倫 Road morgue for an autopsy. At around 10 a.m., Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, appointed by the First Special District Local Court, arrived to examine the body. After华捕头 (Chinese constable) Jiang Linxiang reported the results of the investigation, Zhang ruled that the deceased, Zhang Ziliang, was male and had died from broken bones sustained during a fall from a building. The body was released to his son-in-law, Jiang Rongqing, for burial after he signed a guarantee.</p>

Detective Cui and Liu went to the address to arrest Yang, but he was not found. They then went to Liu's home, where they found a Tongzhou woman, Chen Yan氏, sleeping in the亭子間 (maid's room). Three more packets of the same drug were found under the bed and in a bamboo basket. Chen was arrested and taken to the police station along with Liu and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the Special No. 1 Court.工部局 (Municipal Council) lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested a postponement.
