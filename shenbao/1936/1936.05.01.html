<h3 id="c11">紀念五一勞動節 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>一年一度雄偉壯烈之國際勞動節又告蒞臨矣自來勞動者之生活備極艱苦工作時間往往有繼續至十數小時以上者夜以繼畫運轉不輟雖喘息之機會亦剝奪以俱盡故要求縮短勞動時間之運動蓋亦必然之發展也</p>
<p>考勞動運動之普遍於歐美各國者雖開始於一八九〇年顧其歷史的導源猶遠在一八五六年是年四月二十一日澳大利亞之維多利亞勞動者曾作縮短勞動時間之要求堪稱爲勞動運動之嚆矢一八八〇年美國勞動者以八小時工作爲口號繼起奮鬥至一八八四年决議每年五月一日全美各勞動團體應一致同盟罷工以謀達到八小時工作之目的並指定一八八六年五月一日卽爲第一决示威運動之日是日全美勞動者果在「八小時工作，八小時休息，八小時敎育」口號之下一致停工參加示威運動允以芝加哥方面爲最熱烈結果芝加哥勞動團體竟受武裝警察之襲擊發牛流血慘劇且有九人被捕除一人乘機自殺外餘八人中四人處絞刑二人判無期徒刑二人監禁十五年此卽全球聞名勞動運動中歷史的背景也</p>
<p>迨一八八九年七月十四日第二國際在巴黎舉行第一决大會爲紀念芝加哥慘案起見當卽規定以後每年五月一日爲國際勞動紀念日各國各地之勞動者應一律於是日停止工作爭取「三八制」之獲得所謂「五一節」者於此正式成立</p>
<p>翌年五月一日歐美各國盛大之勞動運動開始發動無數工業都市之勞動者熱烈參加允以英國匃牙利波蘭等國爲最盛且有不少之犧牲焉自是厥後除世界大戰時數年因第二國際之分化若干國家勞動者受戰爭之影響曾一度中止運動外迄今全球各處幾無年不於今日舉行壯烈之紀念其在中國首决紀念五一節」者實肇始於廣州時爲民國六年（一九一七年）至民國八年北平學界亦繼起舉行民國九年乃普及於上海暨全國各重要之都市</p>
<p>吾人於叙述勞動運動史實之餘尚有不能已於言者時至今日除蘇聯業已實行七小時工作制外其他各國勞動者八小時工作之耍求仍未完全實現且在野心國家備戰狂熱之下勞動者所受壓迫與痛苦有更趨深重之勢今後欲求眞正之解放實有待於勞動者自身之繼續努力矣</p>

<h3 id="c216">紀念「五一」與中國勞働者的出路 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 陸京士</p>
<p>「五一」是一個國際勞働紀念節，牠的產生，是全世界工人以許多熟血頭顱換來的，所以經過五十二年的時間「五一」運動的目標雖漸有變遷，但這個偉大的日子，仍然永遠値得全世界工人熱烈紀念的。</p>
<p>一八八四年十月七日，美國八大國際（指美國與坎拿大而言）及其他勞工團體在芝加哥開聯合大會，議决以每年五月一日爲期舉行要求八小時工作制的示威運動，並全國同盟總罷工，指定一八八六年的五月一日第一决示威運動日，這可說是「五一」運動的啟端，也是全世界工人運動最光榮一頁的開始。</p>
<p>我們研究歐洲工業革命的發動是自力的，而中國工業革命却是爲外力所被動的，因爲歐洲各國工業革命援，不久便引起生產資本過剩與原料缺乏的恐慌，爲補救這恐慌，於是各帝國主義者乃紛紛向國外開拓殖民地以爲國內生產品資本原料之蓄洩地，中國恰是最具備這些條件而爲帝國主義者最理想的地方，於是紛紛挾其優越的軍事政治經濟勢力相繼侵入，利用其過剩的資本及中國的天然富源和低賤至無以復加的勞動力，以造成他們的强國地位，以得種種不法利益，中國自身因受外力壓迫不得走上工業化的道路，但始終仍逃不出帝國主義者的控制，民族工業無由獨立發展，且難維持現狀，年來絲紗麵粉等主要工業的幾瀕破產，便是一個明蹬，工業革命旣未成功，而農村因受帝國主義經濟勢力之深入，現呈急速的崩潰。</p>
<p>所以從大體上說，中國現在還沒有勞資階級的形成，所有實際上的區分，正如孫中山先生所說：「不過大貧小貧」而已，因爲同樣在異族壓制下，不論企業家或勞工都感到苦痛的，中國勞働問題的促成者並不是國內的，而是國際帝國主義的侵略，因此中國勞慟問題的解决方法，决不是狹隘的階級鬥爭，而是怎樣打倒帝國主義，換句話說，中國勞働問題就是整個民族問題，必須整個民族獲得獨立解放，勞働者才能得到眞正的幸福，道是中國勞働問題的特性，和其他資本主義國家的勞働問題完全不同之處，我們應該認淸的，</p>
<p>中國國民黨是中國最有歷史最有力量救中國的唯一的黨，三民主義更是復興中國的一個偉大方略，三民主義對民族獨立運動主張對內各民族一律平等，對外聯合弱小民族共同奮鬥，在這種情形下，不僅國內入民須不分畛域，團結一致對外，就是國際間各弱小民族也要結合成堅固一致的戰錢，才能戰勝帝國主義，</p>
<p>此外三民主義中的民生主義便是解决中國勞働問題的唯一鑰匙，它的進行方法爲節制資本與平均地權，用漸進的和平的手段，使資本與士地逐漸移歸公有，廢止私有制度，以完成社會革命，使大多數人得安居樂業，不受生活恐慌的威脅，於此可見中國國民黨對於拯救廣大的勞働入民是具有如何的熱忱與决心的，同樣地勞働羣衆唯有在中國國民黨領導之下去努力，才能獲得確切的保障，</p>
<p>不過我們並不吾認現在民生主義還未實行，中國勞働者的痛苦，並未絲毫解除，反而日見其增加，這並不是三民主義沒有效力，也不是中國國民黨的不努力，實在是國際間帝國主義的侵略一天加緊一天，使民族主義不能完成，民族旣不能獨立，民生主義根本談不上實行，由此足以證明帝國主義的勢力在中國停留一天，中國勞働者及其他各階層人民就一天不能解放，亦唯有集中我們的力量貢獻給黨，使黨的行動强化，黨的主義早日實現，中華民族方能脫離帝國主義的覊絆而獨立，這是我們紀念「五一」應有的認識與覺悟，同時也是中國勞働者的眞正出路，</p>
<h3 id="c217">五一運動與國際勞工組織 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 程海峯</p>
<p>在十九世紀工業積極發展的時候，資本家握有一切優勢與特權，操縱生產與分配，把工人的勞力，視同商品一樣，任意剝削，工人因不堪忍受，團結抵抗的自覺，遂就漸漸的發展起來，五一運動即在此種背景中孕育而成。</p>
<p>美國在那時是新興的工業國家，一八七三年以後的幾年，正受經濟恐慌的襲擊，失業驟增，工人環境更加惡劣，到了一八八四年十月七日美國八大國際及國民的勞工團體在支加哥開聯席大會，議决以每年五月一日爲要求八小時工作制的示威的日期，以司盟總罷工爲示威的一方法，一八八六年五月一日果然舉行第一次的示威運動，成績很好，惟支加哥尙有四萬餘工人未達到此項目的，不能不繼續罷工以貫澈要求，到了五月三日，支市工人在麥可密克製造農具廠附近集會，著名的支加哥慘案遂在這一天發生，美國的工運雖因此慘案而現暫時的消沉，但五一運動的精神並未因此消失，且廣播至歐洲，所以一八九一年法國也發生李勒治區的五一慘案。</p>
<p>到了一八八九年第二國際（昔稱為萬國社會黨，即今之國際勞工社會黨）在巴黎開成立大會，議决以五月一日為萬國紀念日，定為是有階級自覺的世界工人停止工作舉行示威運動的日子，此後五一運動的精神，就較原始的要求——八小時工作制——大加擴展，成為工人自求解放的示威行動，經過好些次流血以後，始得各國政府的承認，在法律上也規定五月一日停止工作而照付工資。</p>
<p>自五一運動開始的一八八六年以迄現在，業已過了五十年，此中經過一次世界大戰，不僅各國工人們以很大的敎訓，而且喚起各國政府與資本家的覺悟，由此更知道社會和平的謀取，必先由改進工人的痛苦生活做起，與其必待示威流血而後接受工人的要求，毌寧在平時集合起來交換意見，以和平的方式，達到工人生活的改善，本着這個目的應運而生的就是各國政府僱主與勞工三方面共同組織起來的國際勞工組織。</p>
<p>我們知道五一的原始要求，是在减少工作時間至每日八小時，不過在歐戰以前，雖經少數國家採用，但多數國家仍然未見實行，國際勞工組織有鑑於此，即在其憲章中說：「無論任何國家，倘不採行合乎人道之保護勞工法律，則必因世界競爭之結果，妨碍其他國家保護勞工政策之進行，」而締的各國亦承認「凡未實行每日工作八小時每週四十八小時之制度者，應積極以採此制度爲目的，」並根據這個原則在一九一九年第一屆大會中制定一公的草案，此那以國際協定之方式，向世界各國推行八小時的制度，在批准此公的的國家，即須切實施行此項制度。</p>
<p>由此看來，可知在國際勞工組織未成立以前，工人所要求的，全憑本身的示威運動去獲取，所得的成績，不但不能十分普遍，且不能得到政府的澈底保障可是自從國際勞工組織成立以後，工人一切的要求，就可在國際勞工大會提出，與政府資方共同商討，制定國際公的，同時在各國一致推行，就成績的範圍來說，自然遠大於一國一地工人運動所獲的成效，就成績的保障而論，一國批准公的，即須制一種法律來推行，不用說法律就是鐵的保障，是以這種解放工人的方法，不用嚴重手段而可以得到較好的成績，很是一個顯著的進步。</p>
<p>時至今日因爲生產技術的進步，工人也應當多享些閒暇時間，而失業嚴重期內，更應縮减工時以謀增加僱用，因此就有每週四十小時制的要求，這項要求，並不曾經過工人的示威流血，而已得到各國在原則上的承認，這是民主主義式的國際勞工大會的成績。</p>
<p>一九三三年第十七屆國際勞工大會已經開始討論每週四十小時制的問題，其後的幾屆大會也都繼續討論，直到去年（一九三五年）大會中，始制定减少工作時間至每週四十小時之公的草案，凡批准此公的之國家，均宜告承認：」　每週四十小時之原則的實施，務求其結果不至减低生活程度，　可採取或便利適於達此目的之各種方策，與依照該會員國所批准共他另行制定之公的所規定之細則負責實施此種原則於各種職業，」現在業已根據這個原則制成的公的，有第十九屆大會（一九三五年）制定的「玻璃瓶製造業縮减工作時間公的草案」，目下正草擬類似的公的草案，使這種改革能普遍實施於公共工程，營造及建築業，鋼鐵業，煤礦業，及紡織業，並定於一九三六年六月四日在日內瓦舉行第二十屆國際勞工大會，决定以上各業實施每週四十小時制之問題，此外如印刷裝訂業及化學工業等問題，或將列在一九三七年的大會議程中。</p>
<p>歸納說來，五一運動的精神——解放勞工與提高工人生活——可以說是與國際勞工糾織的目的相符合，是以國際公給的制定與實施，也就可以說是貫澈五　運動精神的表現，一方而由每日八小時的運動，進而至於每週四十小時的運動，他方面　示威罷工流血的方式，進而爲民主和平立法的方式，此種演進，誠然可以爲勞工界祝祠，而當紀念五一的時候，更願世界的勞工共同擁護這個的進的國際勞工組織，使他能繼續不斷的爲勞工努力！</p>
<h3 id="c218">怎樣紀念勞動節 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 吳醒亞</p>
<p>世界勞動節，到了今天，已是第五十週年的紀念了。</p>
<p>方當五十年前道個時候，美國芝加哥三十六萬勞動者，爲着要求實現八小時勞動，八小時休息，及八小時敎育，遂首先爆發了這一爲改善勞動者自己生活的鬥爭。目前，在若干資本主義的國家，已經大部份實行這種「三八」的制度，甚至有的國家的勞動時間，已經减至七小時以下。世界工業技構的發展，已經使五十年前勞動者的要求，不大適用於現在的環境了</p>
<p>中國是一個工業落後的國家，勞動者生活的水準，顯然比着資本主義各國差了許多倍。而中國之開始紀念勞動節，也遲至民國九年才在上海開始。現在，我們距着第一决的紀念也已過了十六年了，全中國勞動者的生活，在本黨領導之下，顯然是有顯著的改善。可是這種些些的改善，是不够的。因此，我們必須更加努力，以求完成過去勞動者所規定的任務，所遺留的任務。</p>
<p>雖然，我們應該曉得，目前中國之紀念勞動節，其主要的任務，並不是僅僅在於實現「三八」制問題。中國是一個生活落後及敎育不甚普及的國家，近數十年來，受着列强的壓迫侵略，已經使我們國民經濟的建設，完全沒有重大的進展，世界大戰以後，我們全國主要的工業，如紗廠，如絲廠，這些紡織工業，顯然是日陷於破產及動搖之中，農村經濟組織之廣大的崩潰，新興工業的不振，已使全國的經濟危機，幾有陷於不可收拾之慨。自然，在這種工業疲憊當中，勞動者的生活，是不容易改善的；工作時間的减少，是不容易實現的。所以，在中國允其是在上海這個工業區域，尚有許多工友們，掙扎於十小時以上的工作之中。充分的敎育，充分的休息，更是談不到。</p>
<p>在道種情形之中，我們目前如果以要求實現「三八」制爲奮鬥的對象，是不易達得到，而且也是不能達得到的。因爲中國的工廠資本旣少，而且又多在風雨飄搖之中。如果减低工作時間，則工資减少而工友們不能生活。如果將工作時間减少而工資提高，則工廠之出產，將多數不够成本。所以，中國的工友們之紀念勞動節，我們全中國人民之紀念勞動節，實與其他各國有着不同的方法，而具着相同的意義。</p>
<p>這即是說，我們的紀念勞動節，第一個意義是在於發展中國的國民經濟，改良生產的力法，改善生產的技術，實行勞資合作，以反抗帝國主義之侵略，以促進國民經濟令機構之發達及繁榮。第二個意義是在於使全國的工業，均能在一種有系統有步驟的計劃之下進行，使之發展而至於合理化。第三個意義是在於推進生產敎育，識字運動，以普及工人大衆的敎育。第四個意義是在使一切的勞動，皆成爲一種國民的服務勞動，皆成為中華民族自力更生之因素。</p>
<p>我們大家都很明白；如果中國目前工業的生產技術不加緊的改良，勞資不切實的合作，則我　的民族工業，將不能與列强的工業相競爭，即中國工廠也將不能立足而發展。故中國工人要求生活之改善，只有與工廠商人澈底的合作。由合作而推進民族工業，由合作而促進生產技術之合理化，則　方旣可自存，而勞方生活，也自然可以改善。此爲我們今日紀念「五一」節之特　意義，不可不知也。</p>
<p>同時，敎育之普及與否，是與生產技衛之進步成爲正比的。世界敎育　及的國家，如瑞士，如英，美，德，俄，那一個國家不是生產技術最進步的國家，故我們要求普遍的實現八小時的敎育及八小時的休息制度，首先就必須促進生產工具的改良，實現生產物質量的增進，生產的發達是因，而敎育之推進是果。如果要獲得這種結果，則我們必須將勞動視爲一種促進民族工業的義務，完成民族革命的義務。我們只怕沒有更多的體力精神貢獻給國家民族，而不在於當着民族工業頻於崩潰之中，高喊完成「三八」制之口號。</p>
<p>總之，今年今日的勞動節，在中國是有特殊的意義的。這　義，是在於它並不只是一個减少工作時間的紀念日，而且是一個生產建設的紀念日；並不只是一個勞動者勝利的紀念日，而是我們將來民族勝利的紀念日。我們將如何來爭取這個紀念日呢？在今日，我們只有努力生產，努力服務。以最大的力量來進行國民經濟建設；以最大的努力來爭取中國民族工業之發達。只有在國民經濟建設成功當中，我們才能眞眞獲得「三八」制之實現，才能眞眞完成五十年前世界的勞動者所給予我們的仟務。</p>
<p>故今年的「勞動節」是中國人民的勞動服務日，是中華民族　民經濟建設的創造日。推進這一偉大的經濟建設，進行積極的勞動服務，就　　們紀念今年今日的「勞動節」的工作</p>

<p>二十世紀的今日，眞是標準化世紀，不信，你看用的有標準鐘——馬路上一座座的電鐘——玩的有標準乒乓球——連環牌——甚至還有所謂標準美人——這樣下去，一切的一切都快標準化了！再進一步說，「鐘」標準了，「球」也標準了，一切的一切都標準了，假如沒有人去用牠，玩牠，雖標準奚益？所以世界上的東西，儘希望它能够一伴件的趕快標準化起來，同時更希望人們能盡量的享受這些「標準」，不要違背時代！不要開倒車！</p>
<p>「國際電報」是時代尖端的通訊工具，當然更需要標準化！不過「電報」絕對不能與「美人」相比，美人到了年老珠黃的年紀，怎樣也標凖化不起來，可是「電報」要就不標準化，如果標準化了，就得一直標準下去，惟其是「電報」不容易標凖化，所以條件也非常苛刻，至少須具備：　　　服務週到，　　　傳遞迅捷，　　　電文準確，　　　無損國權。</p>
<p>國際無綫報Via　CGRA，鮮紅的霓虹字照耀多麼美麗？這就是標凖化國際電報的大標識！這也就是値得人們擁護為廿世紀爭榮的國際通訊事業；牠！—CGRA—有你意想不到的便利——服務週到；牠有各國的直達電路，最新式的自動高速度機器，科學化的管理方法——傳遞迅捷；牠有專員職司校對工作，熟練的報務員擔任通報職務——電文準確；牠更有極公平而合理的報費攤分規定，純粹國資國營不受外力的控制和壓迫——無損國權；總之牠的一切已完全合乎標凖化的條件，牠現在已經被廣大羣衆們擁戴成爲國際電報路由中的權威。</p>
<p>時代的輪子不停的轉動，我們應該鼓着勇氣向前　進！我們應該做時代的前驅，絕不甘追逐時代而落伍！從事於新時代貿易的入們，這時代是我們的時代，絕不是一般帶老光眼鏡祇知道寫流水賬舊商人的時代，應該利用新式武器—電報—去决鬥最後的勝利，不放棄時間性的通訊方式，採用時代性的國際無綫電報。新時代的商人是應該注意到下列的口號：</p>

<p>— 葉林生</p>
<p>電話局的業務，因用戶的增加而發達，用戶因電話局設置的完備，管理的得宜，因此傳話迅速，得到滿意，所以雙方都有不可分離的密切關係。如果用戶一天一天的减少下去，當然使電話局業務發生很大的影饗，而電話局若不注意設置和管理，那末用戶出了若干月租，而得不到迅速傳遞的代價，一定要感覺非常的苦悶。所以電話業務的發達，和使用電話時的迅速，靈便，不是單方面的企求，而是雙方一致的需要。換句話說：前者不單是話局方面所希望，也是用戶所贊成，後者不單是用戶方面感覺便利，也是話局方面所歡迎，業務發達，同使用電話便利，如一物的兩環，有相聯的關係：也有因果的關係，業務不發達的局，要他有良好的設備和嚴格的管理，是很難做到的事；而管理不嚴，設置不周的結果，一定不能够使得用戶感到傳話的便利，同時也就沒有業務發達的希望。</p>
<p>根據上面的理論，可知話局和用戶，相互間需要合作，是如何的重大而切要，能够雙方合作，聒局方面可以達到業務發達的目的，用戶方面也不致興虛耗月費之嘆；可以得到傳話便利的愉快。</p>
<p>合作的方法，是雙方的，不是片面的。這裏先說，電話局和用戶，合作的方法，再來說用戶用怎樣態度，去同電話局合作。</p>
<p>甲在於話局方面者，我以爲需要做到下面幾件事。</p>
<p>（一）話局管理司機，必須絕對嚴格，舉凡錯號碼，話中拆錢，二重接續等，足以使用戶發生不快感想的事件，必須做到絕對不使其發生。</p>
<p>（二）司機對待用戶，必須溫順謙和，出言須有禮貌。</p>
<p>（三）用戶有所詢問，詢問台必須據實回答卽使不在應答範圍內的事，也要儘量答復。</p>
<p>（四）用戶質問，除應據實將理由解釋外，如果過在司機，應開誠布公，將</p>
<p>怎樣處罰，告訴用戶。</p>
<p>（五）電話損壞，立刻爲其修好（除夜間）機件之損毁，如果確能證明係無心者，亦宜酌量情形，爲適宜之處置。</p>
<p>（六）宜常派人員往用戶裝電話處所視察用戶如有不滿或誤會，視察員負責解釋，有時可卽在用戶機上，試呌電話，以騐局中司機接綫之成績。</p>
<p>（七）宜印發一種「用戶報告表」表內分若干格「例如：接錢快慢」「用語和平與吾」「有無接錯或話中拆錢」以及其他不便利的地方……每季或半年請用戶填寄一决，局方據此可作各別改善的基礎。</p>
<p>（八）宜歡迎用戶派人來局，實地考察，俾免除一切誤會，增進雙方的情誼</p>
<p>乙：在於用戶方面者，要做到下面各事：</p>
<p>（一）宜遵守電話簿上所規定的方法，使用電話。</p>
<p>（二）談話時間，自動的加以節制，勿過於冗長，以免阻碍他人呌此用戶而久等。</p>
<p>（三）電話發生障碍時，或疑慮有人玩弄時，依據號簿上所示通知之處所通知或質問之。</p>
<p>（四）如有不滿意事件，請勿在機上謾駡，而用口頭的或書面的通知局方主管人員。</p>

<h3 id="c224">文學的硬度 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>『文學是軟性的。』</p>
<p>從前，常常有人這樣說，也這樣寫。</p>
<p>且不語這話究竟對不對，硬與軟，總只是性質的問題，並無好壞　否的關係。南華說得好：『物固有所然，物固有所可﹔』硬有硬的用處，軟也有軟的需要。金比銅的價格高，並非全爲金的色采來得燦爛悅目，却是因爲有韌性而可展。這雖然不是　柔勝剛的好例子，總是「軟不一定壞」的明證了</p>
<p>一般的說，劇本的硬度比小說的高﹔因爲劇本，雖然已經不用嚴守「三一律，」但在同一幕或塲內，時間和地方都得一致；要多方的做作，結果總是强硬的了。詩歌本系韻文，讀起來聲音是和諧的；如果韻沒有押妥當，會覺得一生硬，可見詩歌本該是柔和的，所以硬度更來得低。</p>
<p>照派別的關係來說，自然主義的作品，比浪漫派的硬度來得高，因爲自然主義者重理智，浪漫派是凭情感的；自然主義要科學化，浪漫派是尚理想的；「理智，」「科學，」都是嚴格的，當然來得硬。</p>
<p>單就小說，從作法上說，正傳體來得硬性，自傳體比較軟性。自　體的小說，形式上作者即使並非主角，總是在場的一分子，假作依照親自耳聞目見的寫作，於無形中，是個中心，可以婉婉轉轉的報告，容易使得讀者表同情，所以來得軟性。正傳體作者站在第三者旁觀的地位，態度不免冷靜，也得嚴格一點，當然是硬性的了。</p>
<p>文學是「人格的表現，」以一篇作品的軟硬，問作者的個性成着正比例。在這條件下面，首先可說的是女作家的出品，硬度總比男作家的低，——這自然也是一般的話。</p>
<p>作家是「環境的產物，」「地方色采」很有着關係，所以西洋文學與東方文學不同；比較起來，西洋文學是硬性的，——重理智，注重「斷片的描寫；」東方文學是軟性的。「時代性」也很有着關係，古代的文學來得軟性，因爲多半是浪漫主義的產物，現代文學是硬性的了；——新文學是歐化的，這不但中國，日本也這樣。</p>
<p>「民族性」在文學的色采上古着重要的地位﹔這無害於作者個性的表達，是相互爲因的續露着的，所以同在西洋，德國文學有着德國文學的特色，法國文學有着法國文學的特色；在東方，中國與日本的文學，也是各有特徵的。由性質上看，總覺得德國文學比法國文學　得硬，俄國文學自然硬度更高，大概因爲氣候寒冷，生活艱難，作者的態度來得嚴肅的緣故。</p>
<p>同是由一個作家所寫的，硬度也有大小﹔大概喜悅的情調是軟性的，悲感的是硬性的，或者本來隨隨便便，作品的硬度低﹔因爲「受了國難的刺激，」一經認眞，硬度就高了。——至少有人在這樣說，也有人在這樣寫。</p>

<p>「這是啥子？」</p>
<p>「呵，這是鞋子。」</p>
<p>兒子看見爸爸在翻弄他學校帶回來的箱子，拿着那些不該讓老頭子看見的東西，便紅起了臉。</p>
<p>「鞋子？鞋子有這樣的麼？」</p>
<p>「爸爸，這是皮子做的哪。」</p>
<p>爸爸不看鞋子，只是將不高興的眼光，直朝兒子的臉上打量。</p>
<p>「多少？我給你的錢，就是這樣花去的麼？嗯。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，不貴，剛剛，……只不過一塊錢哪，比布鞋子才多……才多三角。」</p>
<p>兒子勉强笑着回答，把實際的價錢，完全瞞去。</p>
<p>「這還相因，這還……讓我穿穿看！」</p>
<p>老頭子臉色軟和了，一面這麽說着，便坐在竹椅上，把粘有泥士的足板，用自己的袖頭擦了幾擦，就穿上那烏黑發光的傢伙。</p>
<p>「嚇，剛好，就像替我買的一樣。」</p>
<p>老頭子發出贊美的聲音。</p>
<p>兒子看見髒足鑽進鞋裏面，心裏暗自着急，但又不好說得，只好做出討好的樣子說道：</p>
<p>「爸爸，不忙，我去替你打盆水來，合式麽？以後你就拿去穿吧，我另外……」</p>
<p>「我穿哈子？」老頭子穿上一隻，就站了起來，偏起頭，用眼睛端詳着：「這怕路難走了？」現出忽然記起什麽了的神氣，「哈，看起來，倒像前些年辰的靴子哩！」</p>
<p>媽在隔屋淸理洗好的衣衫，聽見老頭子在査兒子帶回家的東西，便擔心他要追問錢的出處，連累到她這偸錢給兒子的老媽媽的。等到曉得老頭子高興了，就一面拿起一伴藍布衣衫折着，一面走到門口笑嬉嬉地說道：</p>
<p>「明天你不是要去做客麼？兒子給你的，你就享享福吧？」</p>
<p>「他們年靑人是圖好看……我倒喜歡牠牢實！」老頭子躬下身子，用手指把皮子　了幾　，「這是哈皮哪？我看，牛皮可沒這麼軟！」</p>
<p>「爸爸，這是製革皮，洋法子做的。」</p>
<p>兒子一面回答着，一面向媽霎着得意的眼睛，好像是在說：老頭子這下可給我騙住了。</p>
<p>媽就在老頭子背後，尖起嘴巴，對兒子豎一下指頭。</p>
<p>老頭子聽見是洋法子做的，輕輕放下鞋子，扳起面孔說道：</p>
<p>「以後，可不要買什麼洋貨吧！」</p>
<p>接着，把雙手朝背後一放，向門外走去，剛剛走過門檻，又掉回頭來，帶着愛惜的神情，吩咐道：</p>
<p>「把牠好好檢起！」</p>
<p>媽看見老頭子走了，才可嚀兒子道：</p>
<p>「別那末高興！下决得小心哪。還有，你那些啥子瓶兒杯兒的，也該檢一檢！」</p>
<p>「不要緊！我現在會騙他了，哪像先前。……」</p>
<p>兒子隨卽小聲地哼起毛毛雨一類的歌兒來。</p>
<p>第二天老頭子要去做客了，把老婆子給他補好的破鞋看一下，縐着眉頭說：</p>
<p>「沒補疤的，沒有了麼？」</p>
<p>老婆子懂得他的心意，便把兒子的皮鞋，抓來朝他面前一丟。</p>
<p>「現成的，你都不穿麽？……還要啥子新鞋呢？」</p>
<p>同時，又將那雙補過的布鞋子，給他丟在床底下。</p>
<p>老頭子不說話，就把皮鞋慢慢穿上，忽然想起了什麼，立刻又把牠脫下。</p>
<p>「怎麼？你不穿麽？」</p>
<p>「爲啥不穿？……可是，你呌我一路穿去麽？讓石子磨壞牠，好主意！」</p>
<p>老頭子穿上藍布新衣，一隻手提着一隻皮鞋，便赤着雙足，向田間走去了。</p>
<p>老婆子見兒子嘟着嘴站在旁邊，就說道：</p>
<p>「你怕他穿壞麽？……他才愛惜得很呀！……你該讓他喜歡喜歡一下子，他才高興出學錢哪。……這可憐的老頭子！」</p>
<p>下午老頭子依舊光着一雙足板回來了，但手上却沒提着那雙皮鞋。</p>
<p>老婆子驚訝地問道：</p>
<p>「呀，皮鞋喃？」</p>
<p>老頭子已有醉意，笑嘻嘻地找根板凳坐下。</p>
<p>「你眞猜不到，今天……。倒杯茶來，菜炒得太鹹了！」</p>
<p>「打失了麼？……看樣子，又不像！……哦，酒瘋子，你藏着兜人玩！」老婆子翻着疑惑的眼珠，直朝老頭子的腰上溜去。隨卽把頭一偏，嘴巴一尖，「我不愛猜的，兒子跟你巴巴式式地買回來，打失了，不說他難過，我都不答允你！」跟着向兒子說道：「你去給他倒杯茶來，……他不會打失你的，打失了，我要他陪你錢。」</p>
<p>兒子現着抑鬱的神悄，勉强答允着，去倒茶去了。</p>
<p>「不要忙嘛，吃了茶，聽我說，……一路上口乾得很……秧田裏的水，實在不好吃，一股泥腥味，……你看，陳三頭子那東西，也在那裏。」</p>
<p>「哪一個陳三頭子？」</p>
<p>「哦，你忘了麽？……這亂花錢的陳三頭子，你都記不起麽？……我告訴你嘛，有一回，人家牽條牛去賣給他，喊價五十元。他斜起眼睛看了一眼，回頭就走，一面搖着手說，不耍，不要，五十元一條的，我要他做啥子……？有好的，再給我牽一頭來！……在我們看來，五十元一條的，已經很貴了，他却看不起！這眞是痰迷了心！後來呢，人家摸着他的脾氣了，就把那條値五十元的，重新打整一頓，毛子刷過，蹄子，角，都搽上油，再牽來，…陳三爺，這條上好的，你就打燈籠火把去找，也找不出來！……你看我們陳三爺怎樣呢，這下子是看了又看的，從頭到尾。…你耍多少錢？…多少錢？陳三爺，我們不敢佔你老入家的便宜，八十元，一個也不能少。…陳三爺怎樣呢，又從尾看到頭，故意不高興地罵，胡說，哪有這麽貴，這些人的眼睛，你是騙不着的。頂多七十元！…你看，他還說他眼睛好，眞是菩提子做的。…人家就回答他說，陳三爺，我們怎敢瞞你老人家，說句良心話，多要你價錢，也該天雷打。…這痰迷心的傢伙，便說，好，你給我留下吧！…哈哈，今天他也在那里做客。」</p>
<p>老頭子說到這里，看見兒子端茶來了，一面接着茶杯，一面釘着兒子問道</p>
<p>「怎麽不是？我騙你老人家做啥？錢總是你老人家給的，又有個數目。我哪還有多錢來花呢？」</p>
<p>兒子裝出一付眞是不說假話的樣子。</p>
<p>「是的，我也曉得，你沒多錢亂花。」</p>
<p>老頭子點點頭之後，就埋着頭喝茶</p>
<p>兒子這時又向他的媽，霎着得意的眼睛。</p>
<p>老婆子却催着老頭子說道：</p>
<p>「酒瘋子，不要儘是刮達刮達的，…告訴我鞋子呢，是不是入家跟你借去了？」</p>
<p>「哪里？你才肯借哩！那樣的鞋子。」老頭子略微做出呵斥的神氣，「這鞋子眞奇怪，走起路來，革呀革呀地響着，還沒進門，就有八九個頭伸出來喊道：呵呀，這是什麽在響呀！……囉，洋鞋子囉！」</p>
<p>接着，喝了一口茶。</p>
<p>「陳三頭子那傢伙，一把拉着我，…呵哈，老頭子，你也洋盤起來哪。多少錢？多少錢？我道：你猜，你猜，…八塊，…不對，你猜錯了。…那末，九塊。…嚇，這洋鬼子的東西，眞騙着他了。」</p>
<p>又喝了一口茶。</p>
<p>「他們眞把鹽大拋小用的，菜炒得那樣鹹！…後來，我就對他說，比布鞋子多三角，一塊錢。……一塊？三塊錢，我都願意要！他簡直驚得跳了起來。我說，你眞的肯耍麽？哪料他眞的摸出三元錢來了。這個痰迷心的傢伙！」</p>
<p>「哪，你眞的就賣去了麽？」</p>
<p>老婆子睜大了眼睛。</p>
<p>「沒有？當着那麼多的客人，要你才肯丟醜哩！我就對他說，我又不想賺錢，賣牠做啥呢？跟着又說一句人情話，送你倒可以的，賣麽？實在不好意思…」</p>
<p>「哪，老東西，你就這樣送他了麽？」</p>
<p>老婆子有些急起來了。兒子也更加現得不安。</p>
<p>「我沒那麼傻！一塊錢的貨，又不是白搶來的。這算起來，要値五斗穀子哪。說的時候，我也生怕那東西說，那末，好！就送給我吧。個個人都曉得他是不大客氣的。我就趕緊接說下去，我是不喜歡穿洋鬼子的東西。這是我那娃娃的，今天穿來，他還不大高興哩！」</p>
<p>老婆子抿着嘴笑起來了。</p>
<p>「你簡直是個老滑頭！」</p>
<p>「嚇，還說我老滑頭！我今天就是太老實一點了。我說，買成五塊，那多好哩！」</p>
<p>老頭子隨卽摸出三個袁頭出來。</p>
<p>「呀，你到底賣了麽？當着那麽多的人就賣了麽？」老婆子立刻向他走了一步，鼓大着眼睛問，同時幾乎要駡了起來，「你的臉皮，眞…眞厚！」</p>
<p>「這沒法呵！你不知道，張團總也在旁邊打總成哪。你想想看。他說的話，怎好不答允的？…這個老怪物，往往一開口，就是捐呀，稅呀，估住挖你的腰包，一點不留情面。今天他一下子却對我好起來，挨近我的耳朶笑迷迷地說：賣呀，賣的好，賺他兩塊大洋，你還可以呌你兒子買一雙呢？我自家心里也盤算，盤算，不錯，一石穀子的價呀。我就不管衆人笑不笑，只說團總吩咐的，我就只好照辦了。眞的，要不是團總說話，誰肯當衆丟臉哩，况且，他們又都笑得那般怪聲怪氣的。」</p>
<p>兒子氣靑了臉，立刻朝屋里走去。</p>
<p>「蠢東西，你生氣麼？來，我給你一塊，再去買一雙好了！」</p>
<p>兒子只有忍着氣，轉身來接着，但走開幾步時，又給老頭子，喊着：</p>
<p>「轉來，我再給你一塊。……你也再同我買一雙吧！」</p>
<p>「你還買啥個呢？錢不要隨便花呀！」老婆子知道鞋子的實價，就連忙阻止他，「沒有新鞋穿，我替你做好了！」</p>
<p>「不，我倒不一定要穿，就是怕還有　子，肯出三塊錢來買哪。」</p>
<p>老頭子站起身來，把袁頭交給兒子就走開了。</p>
<p>兒子氣得亂跌着足，窄着喉管，低聲發急地駡道：</p>
<p>「眞是活見鬼囉！你這老儍子，人家八塊錢一雙哪！」</p>
<p>「才八塊，你不是告訴我十塊麽！」</p>
<p>老婆子向兒子驚疑地問。</p>
<p>兒子一下子紅起臉，囁嚅地說：</p>
<p>「我沒有說過十塊吧？」</p>
<p>「唔，你全向我報謊賬！眞不知道，你們年靑人，是怎樣的大拋小用哪！」</p>
<p>老婆子不快樂地，扁一扁嘴。</p>
<h3 id="c226">那個船夫 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>當我重再回轉到新加坡的時候，我馬上便重再碰到那位上决載我下輪船的船夫。他熱誠地歡迎着我，說：</p>
<p>『你果然叉回來了！好呀！好呀！做人是困苦的，做人也是快樂的呀！』</p>
<p>下午他做完了工，便把我拉到鄰近咖啡館里去，說道：</p>
<p>『喝一杯咖啡去吧。我同你說過，中街有好的咖啡館呢。』</p>
<p>咖啡館里仍舊有那麽多的人；各種的話語，各種的角色，和各種的烟霧。</p>
<p>我看見他的額角上有一塊新鮮的傷痕，還沒有結成了疤，便問：</p>
<p>『新近又打過架麼？』</p>
<p>『吓，吓，打了一陣。很爽快。」</p>
<p>『什麽事？』</p>
<p>『那是小事，』他拔起一支香烟抽起來，接着說道。『你知道那班海上的舢板手的，碼頭和海上的勢力是在他們的手心底。「　山」來的「新客」，一不留心，是會被敲了一些竹槓的。噯，罷了，罷了。上海在打仗，而他們却在私運×貨。一次給我看到了，我說：</p>
<p>「bay！幹什麽勾常？什麽黑白錢都好賺的！」</p>
<p>「　你鳥事！」那一個說。</p>
<p>「管你媽的鳥事！」一個拳頭從我的手里打出來。那個跌進船里去，另幾個從船尾和船艙里爬出去，拿着木棍。我孤單單地一個人啦。走爲上策。剛拿着槳，一個最先的人把木棍子擊在我的右額上。一惱，我用猛力抓住了他的棍子，乘勢打出去。那一個叉倒下去了；他們一窩蜂都擁過來。我抓住槳，敏捷地划起來。吐一口唾沫在第二個人的身上。哈哈！他們在後面咒駡啦。那只笨重的大木雞，有我這只小鴨子的輕快麼？哈哈！」</p>
<p>『然而你流血啦。』我說。</p>
<p>『那有什麼緊要。我在「馬打厝一都坐過牢，罰過錢啦。那有什麽大事。—吓吓，檳榔嶼怎樣了？」他看着我。</p>
<p>『沒有什麽。大家叫苦哩。』我說。</p>
<p>『呌苦？道有什麽大不了。一個人總有辦法的。難道會餓死麼？』</p>
<p>『他們可以比你！』我笑道。</p>
<p>『我？我有什麽大不了。在鄕里被紳士趕出來；不准我回鄉。捉蝦碰到蝦寮關門；開鑛碰到人家裁工。我有什麽大不了。』</p>
<p>『你會揹四五百斤的貨物；你會划船；』我加着說，『你還會打架哩！』</p>
<p>「噯噯，罷了，罷了。頭家同我說：「你從今以後不要下海去；你揹着貨袋好吧。—你總喜愛生事哩。」我說，「好，什麽都可以。」所以我現在不是划船手，而是　貨夫了。」</p>
<p>咖啡館里熱烘烘地，工人們把一片麵包一口吞下去，高聲地大笑着。店夥，經理和年輕將頭家們，在呷着咖啡汁，低低地商量着事情。</p>
<p>他看了我一眼，又說道：</p>
<p>「經理警告我：「不要閙出事來，好好地做着工吧，免得把職業失掉了。」我怕什麼？難道我不曾失過業麽？便是失了業又怎樣？這年頭，不要餓死便算了。——我是不會餓死的，所以我不怕，我不怕的。』</p>
<p>鄰近着的海，輪船的汽笛在響着。他於是想起來，——</p>
<p>『上幾天，砂　越捉魚的同鄕走出來新加坡，他們預備回</p>
<p>「唐山」去。他們說：「媽的天年魚都被撈乾了，臭鹼魚又沒有價錢。大家回唐山去餓肚皮去。」</p>
<p>『「餓肚皮不是隨處都一樣麼？」我說。</p>
<p>「他們沒有說話。他們似乎都沒了主意了。可憐的人們！我想：</p>
<p>『「人爲什麼要餓肚皮？爲什麼會餓肚皮？如果我，我便——」』</p>
<p>『便怎樣？』我問。</p>
<p>「怎樣？打着架過日子好了；打完架便走到監獄里找飯吃去。出來時再打架，打完後又再走到監獄里去。什麼大不了？」</p>
<p>『呵，呵，呵，想不到你是一付天生打架的機器！」我大笑起來。</p>
<p>『我豈只一付打架的機器，』他的臉孔突然正經起來，顯出他幷不是說笑。「我，還是划船的機器，駝貨的機器，紳士頭家們出氣的機器哩！』</p>
<p>一小段香烟屁股被拋在地上，那餘火還在地上吐出了烟氣</p>
<p>一個店夥走過來，喊道：</p>
<p>『不要長舌頭了。整日里瘋三話四地。「新及」（船名）來了，做工去吧！』</p>
<p>於是，他把杯子里剩着的咖啡倒到杯托的盤子里去，一口氣把牠啜乾了。</p>
<p>然後，這個黑色的臉孔，强健的身軀，廣闊而突出的額角，蓬一亂的頭髮，薄紗衫，短褲子的人物從我的眼前消失了。遺留着那額角的傷痕，和那潑辣的話語，雜在混沌的水汽和烟霧中，在我的腦角上旋轉着，旋轉着。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Legislative Yuan Passes National Assembly Organization Law; Original Draft Article 19 Deleted; Item 2 of Article 3 Listed Separately; Amended and Passed Executive Yuan Organization Law <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 58th meeting on the morning of the 30th, with 66 committee members including Huang Youchang present. Under the chairmanship of Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Hancao, the session continued deliberating the draft National Assembly Organization Law. Articles 4 to 20 of the draft law were amended and passed during the second reading, except for Article 19 (the power to interpret this law belongs to the National Government), which was deleted. Subsequently, the entire bill was passed in the third reading. The original order of Articles 1 to 5 of the draft bill was changed. Furthermore, Item 2 of the original Article 3 of the draft bill was listed as a separate article. As a result, the entire bill still consisted of 20 articles. Many textual changes were also made to the original draft. In addition, the Executive Yuan Organization Law was amended and passed, and it was decided to hold the 59th meeting at 8:00 AM on the 1st to deliberate on the two crucial proposals of the Draft Constitution and the National Assembly Representative Election Law. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Process of Passage in the Third Reading</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 30th, after the chairman announced the continuation of the deliberation of the draft National Assembly Organization Law, Chuan Bingchang reported that the various committee members had expressed many opinions at last week's Yuan meeting regarding the issue of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members attending and being present at the National Assembly. Secretary-General Liang had also recently invited some legislators to exchange views, seeking to bring the positions of the various committee members on the above issue closer, in order to ensure smooth progress during the Yuan meeting's deliberation. At that time, it was unanimously agreed to designate the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members as ex officio representatives to the National Assembly. This was because the principles promulgated by the Central Government only stipulated their attendance at the National Assembly, without clearly indicating their status in the meeting. In the future, interpretations would inevitably lead to disputes. Now, by confirming them as ex officio representatives, it can both supplement the intent of the Central Government's principles and avoid future interpretation troubles. As for the original Article 5 of the draft bill, it was mainly decided not to change it any further. The above-mentioned agreed result was also unanimously endorsed by the 24-member committee, and Secretary-General Liang has drafted a new amended proposal to present to the meeting. Liang then stated that, as a result of exchanging opinions among colleagues, it was felt that the article order of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the draft bill, which had been amended and passed during the second reading, should be changed, and the wording of the articles should also be reconsidered. Since the draft law was disclosed, the public has generally understood the factual responsibility borne by this Yuan in this law. However, regarding the legislative technicalities of this law, they hope that this Yuan should reconsider it. For example, Article 4 of the draft law suddenly stipulates that all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees may attend the National Assembly, which, in terms of legislative technique, seems to have a flavor of opportunism. In order to adjust the system of this law, it is proposed to preface this law with an introduction: "The National Government hereby convenes the National Assembly in accordance with the resolution of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, and specially formulates and promulgates the National Assembly Organization Law." This clarifies the origin of this law. The original Article 2 of the draft is renumbered as Article 1, in order to show the main mission of this National Assembly to decide on the Constitution. It is decided to renumber the original Article 1 of the draft as Article 2. Then, the original Articles 4 and 5 of the draft are renumbered as Articles 3 and 4, in order to show the basis of the organization of the National Assembly. This type of modification does not violate the central principles, but only serves to beautify the wording of the articles. As for the fact that the National Assembly is convened to promote constitutional government, during the period of political tutelage, the Party has exercised political power on behalf of the people. At the beginning of the constitutional period, the participation of the Central Committee members of the Party in the meeting is a necessary procedure for the transitional period. Moreover, the Party's opening up of political power does not mean the dissolution of the responsibility for revolution and national construction, but rather the granting of opportunities to counter-revolutionaries to usurp the country and cause political chaos. All citizens should be able to understand this intention. Lü Zhiyi proposed that Liang's proposal be discussed again after the completion of the second reading and before the start of the third reading, in accordance with the rules of procedure. The various committee members unanimously endorsed this. The second reading of the original Article 4 of the draft bill was then started in order to decide on the various articles. Xu Yuangao raised doubts about the title of ex officio representative because Liang proposed that the Central Committee members be changed to ex officio representatives to the National Assembly. Zhou Wei also said that there was no precedent for this in the constitutions of various countries, and there was no such thing as an ex officio representative. The chairman stood up and replied that our country is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, and our constitution is a Five-Power Constitution, both of which are unprecedented in various countries around the world. The spirit of our legislation should not be based on whether there is precedent in the legislation of other countries around the world. Furthermore, our revolution is different from the French and Russian revolutions, and the circumstances of constitutionalism in France and Russia cannot be compared. It should be known that the Party is the creator of the Republic of China and also the nursemaid of the period of political tutelage. At the beginning of the constitutional period, the Central Committee members of the Party, who created the Republic of China as a nursemaid, are listed as ex officio representatives to the National Assembly, which is only to fulfill the mission they bear in the revolutionary history. There seems to be no room for doubt or criticism. After the chairman's reply, there was no dissent, and the amendment was passed in the second reading according to the proposal. Subsequently, the second reading of the original Articles 5 to 20 of the draft bill was carried out. Except for the exchange of the order of the original Articles 13 and 14 of the draft bill according to the chairman's proposal, and the deletion of the disciplinary methods in the original Article 18 of the draft bill according to Sheng Zhenwei's proposal, and the deletion of the original Article 19 of the draft bill according to Liu Tong's proposal, the rest were only textual modifications, and the entire second reading was passed. Then Liang's proposal was discussed again, and it was also amended and passed according to Liang's proposal. However, the second item of the original Article 3 of the draft bill was listed as Article 6. As a result, there were still 20 articles. Then it was passed in the third reading. As for the introduction to this law, it was mainly stated that after this Yuan passes the National Assembly Organization Law, it will be explained together and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. There is no need to create this special legislative precedent, and as a result, no introduction was listed. After the third reading of this case was passed, the amendment of the Executive Yuan Organization Law was passed according to the review opinions of the Legislative System and Finance Committees. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun visited Matsumuro at the Zhangyuan official residence at 8:00 AM on the 30th to continue discussing the Hebei-Chahar issue, departing at approximately 1:00 PM. Song, due to the development of bandit diplomacy, will return to Pingjin within the next week. As of the 30th, the two sides have stipulated the following regarding the anti-communist issue: If communists are found within the borders of Hebei and Chahar, the authorities will immediately suppress them without relying on any outside forces. If the communists do not infiltrate the borders of Hebei and Chahar, it is agreed to postpone the implementation of anti-communist measures. The authorities have already earnestly declared this to a certain party and have this certainty. The diplomatic issue is currently divided into two parts: the cancellation of Eastern Hebei, and the Northern Chahar issue. Discussions in the previous day or two have reached a stage where the puppet organization will not be difficult to dissolve. Personnel issues have been outlined in discussions. Although Yin himself is trying to struggle, the Japanese side has decided not to support him. However, further discussions are needed regarding whether the words "fundamental cancellation of the Eastern Hebei government" should be used in writing. If negotiations cannot be completed within the day, Matsumuro will be responsible. Discussions will resume when Song returns to Pingjin. The latter matter is more complicated and requires resolution of the former matter. Matsumuro will mediate and consult with the Kwantung Army headquarters. It is still undetermined who the opposing party is. The diplomatic issue has indeed developed and will not be affected by the anti-communist matter. (Special dispatch of the 30th)</p>

Furthermore, the Mao, Xu, and Liu troops gathered in the Kangcheng area are also feeling pressure from our troops' suppression and are gradually retreating westward, intending to cross the river and escape. However, our western river troops have made strict deployments along the river, and it is impossible for the bandits to escape back to their old nests in northern Shaanxi. Currently, our various routes are working together to suppress them.

<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The grand and solemn International Labor Day arrives once again. Historically, the lives of laborers have been extremely difficult. Working hours often continued for more than ten hours. Day and night, they toiled incessantly, even the opportunity to catch their breath was completely taken away. Therefore, the movement to shorten working hours was an inevitable development.</p>
<p>Although the widespread labor movement in Europe and the United States began in 1890, its historical origins date back to 1856. On April 21 of that year, laborers in Victoria, Australia, made a demand to shorten working hours, which can be called the beginning of the labor movement. In 1880, American laborers, using the eight-hour workday as their slogan, rose up to fight. By 1884, they resolved that on May 1st of each year, all labor organizations in the United States should unite in a general strike to achieve the goal of an eight-hour workday, and designated May 1, 1886, as the first day of demonstration. On that day, laborers across the United States unanimously went on strike under the slogan of "eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of education" to participate in the demonstration. Chicago was the most enthusiastic. As a result, labor organizations in Chicago were attacked by armed police, resulting in a bloody tragedy, and nine people were arrested. Except for one person who committed suicide while taking the opportunity, four of the remaining eight were sentenced to hanging, two were sentenced to life imprisonment, and two were sentenced to fifteen years. This is the historical background of the world-renowned labor movement.</p>
<p>Then, on July 14, 1889, the Second International held its first major conference in Paris. In order to commemorate the Chicago tragedy, it was decided that May 1st of each year would be International Labor Day. Laborers in all countries and regions should stop working on that day to strive for the "three-eight system." The so-called "May Day" was officially established at this time.</p>
<p>On May 1st of the following year, a grand labor movement began in Europe and the United States. Countless industrial cities enthusiastically participated, with England, Hungary, and Poland being the most prominent. There were also many sacrifices. Since then, except for a few years during World War I when the Second International disintegrated and laborers in some countries were affected by the war and temporarily suspended the movement, almost every year to this day, solemn commemorations are held around the world. The first commemoration of May Day in China was initiated in Guangzhou in the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917). By the eighth year of the Republic of China, academic circles in Peiping also followed suit. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, it spread to Shanghai and other important cities across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to recounting the historical facts of the labor movement, there is something else we cannot help but say. To this day, except for the Soviet Union, which has already implemented a seven-hour workday, the demand for an eight-hour workday by laborers in other countries has not yet been fully realized. Moreover, under the war-mongering frenzy of ambitious countries, the oppression and suffering suffered by laborers are becoming more and more severe. In the future, to achieve true liberation, it is necessary for laborers themselves to continue their efforts.</p>

<p>Asmara Italian sources here claim that the northern front battles are nearing their final stage and should be resolved within a week. (National Telegram, 30th).</p>
<p>(Rome) According to official telegrams today, a detachment under General Graziani, commander of the southern Italian forces, has occupied Sassabaneh, a strategically important town on the Hindenburg Line south of Harar. The two armies fought fiercely for four days and suffered heavy casualties. Later, the Italian side transferred reinforcements from various locations to join the battle, finally capturing the town. At the same time, there were also reports of the fall of the town of Bulale. According to a report from General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, the solid defensive line between Sassabaneh and Bulale was designed and built by Belgian and Turkish military officers and defended by the troops of Abyssinian General Nasibu. Its layout was very thorough, equipped with various new weapons, and the defending troops were determined to resist to the end. The Italian army used Somali short rifle units, the Blackshirt soldiers of the Bevilacqua division, a small detachment of soldiers from the Forest Corps, and colonial troops to cooperate in a strong attack, advancing wave after wave, charging bravely. After four days of fierce fighting, the defensive line was finally breached. Italian mechanized units are currently pursuing the retreating enemy forces. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a communiqué stating, "The troops under the command of General Graziani, commander of the southern Italian forces in Abyssinia, occupied the town of Sassabaneh on the Vogaden front yesterday afternoon." This town is located south of Dagapugh, originally the location of the forward headquarters of the southern Abyssinian forces. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since the East African Expeditionary Force occupied the city of Makfort in northern Abyssinia, it has been generally believed that General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, can reach the capital of Abyssinia in the shortest possible time. The northern Italian forces are advancing from the city of Tassiei in two directions: one is the westernmost route, which requires crossing many rivers, and the other is advancing along the "Royal Road." Although the journey is longer, the march is easier. This route of troops has already crossed the city of Enkober (the old mansion of the Asu Abyssinian tribe). The troops under the command of General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the southern route, have been delayed due to the fierce resistance of Abyssinian General Nasibu, but have already captured the town of Sassabaneh. The Italian forces on this route have recently been in contact with the Abyssinian army in various places such as Danagobo, Kunugadu (36 kilometers southeast of Sassabaneh), Dagaleto, and Bilko. As a result, the Italian side suffered a total of 21 officers and 27 enlisted men killed, and 16 officers and 47 enlisted men wounded. The total number of native soldiers killed and wounded was 1,367. In addition, the rainy season in Abyssinia has already arrived, and the rear supply of the Italian army is quite difficult. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital Addis Ababa (a few miles south of Amba Aradam). Abyssinian soldiers who were wounded and not killed in the great battle returned here today. According to them, the battle started on March 31st. The Abyssinian Emperor personally commanded more than 20,000 imperial guards to engage in battle. On the first day, the Abyssinian army broke through the Italian front lines. On the second day, the Abyssinian army once again defeated the Italian army. On the third day, when the Abyssinian army was making smooth progress, suddenly the sky turned dark, with hundreds of Italian aircraft dropping bombs and dispersing suffocating blue gas. Those Abyssinian soldiers who were not equipped with gas masks died instantly. Only a very small number equipped with masks were able to escape. The defeat of the imperial guards led to the Abyssinian side being in a disadvantageous position. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a communiqué stating that the northern Italian forces are advancing towards the Abyssinian capital. Another detachment, departing from Lake Chana in the northwest, has occupied the city of Tebra Tabor, the capital of Begemder province.

<p>(Rome) After the East African Expeditionary Force recently occupied the town of Sassabaneh on the southern route in Abyssinia, military experts here believe that the fortifications set up by the Abyssinian army to defend the cities of Harar and Jijiga (namely, those presided over by Turkish General Vehip Pasha) have completely failed. The Italian army has been bombarding the Abyssinian positions fiercely in recent months, and is now no more than 200 kilometers from the strategically important city of Harar on the southern route. Harar is close to the railway. Once lost, the Abyssinian capital's access to the sea will be cut off. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital According to news from the British relief team, the Italian vanguard occupied the strategic location of Mount Dama today without resistance. 10,000 Italian troops are now advancing towards Debre Berhan, 70 miles from the Abyssinian capital. Today, Italian aircraft flew to the airport of the Abyssinian capital and strafed it with machine guns. All able-bodied men in the Abyssinian capital have gone to the front lines, intending to make a final effort to stop the Italians from advancing. Debre Berhan is a plain but has mountainous areas, separated from the Abyssinian capital. Therefore, this mountainous area is the last line of defense for the Abyssinian people.

<p>(London) Collie, President of the National Bank of Abyssinia, is currently in London discussing a £500,000 loan with the British financial community. He recently told the press that "the general public should not think that once the Italian army occupies the Abyssinian capital, Abyssinia's resistance will end. It should be known that even if the Abyssinian capital falls, the government will move to the interior. At that time, although communication between Abyssinia and the outside world will be difficult, the supply of munitions can still be continuously imported through British Egypt and Sudan. As far as material resistance is concerned, as long as there are soldiers in the country for the Emperor to mobilize, the actions to resist the aggressor will not be interrupted for a single day."

<p>(Rome) French aviator Trouillet, the aviation advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor, arbitrarily piloted an aircraft from France to the Abyssinian capital on the 25th of this month. He was forced to land in Sendosel, Italy. Local authorities confiscated the aircraft and placed Trouillet under guard for three days. He was not allowed to regain his freedom until Tuesday night, when he was allowed to do so on his honor. Trouillet is currently staying in a certain hotel. It is said that he originally intended to land in Greece and then fly to Abyssinia. Unexpectedly, the oil pipe suddenly broke near Sardinia, forcing him to turn back to Italy and land in Sendosel.

<p>(Paris) French aviator Trouillet, the aviation advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor, is currently in Sendosel, Italy. He told a Rome correspondent of the Morning Post yesterday, "The rumor that the Abyssinian Emperor has already boarded a British plane and fled to British Kenya, and that I am traveling to that place to escort the Abyssinian Emperor to another location is not true. I have been ordered to fly to the location of the Abyssinian Emperor and, if necessary, plan to escort the Abyssinian Emperor to the French Riviera in southern France.

<p>(London) Diplomatic official Stanhope declared in the House of Lords today that if the line of sanctions against Italy can be maintained for a long time, he believes that Italy will realize that its position is far less advantageous than not resorting to force. Stanhope made this statement in response to a motion by Member Davies advocating that the League of Nations should, in accordance with the methods of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, appoint a commission of inquiry into the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Stanhope also firmly stated that sanctions against Italy are gradually taking effect. If we can prove that the war is fruitless, then we will achieve something that no one needs to be ashamed of, and that will have a deterrent effect in the future. The British government cannot agree with Davies' motion because it is impractical and unsound. Davies then withdrew his motion. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Lords, Lord Davies proposed that the League of Nations should follow the precedent of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry and send a commission of inquiry to Abyssinia to conduct an on-site investigation. Lord Stanhope, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, responded on behalf of the government, saying, "The League of Nations was unable to threaten Italy with sanctions to avoid war before the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, and was also unable to stop it after the war broke out. All of this is true. However, the current war has not yet ended, and the Italian army is making progress, leading to it being further and further away from its base. The difficulties it encounters are also increasing day by day. This is what we should know." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted a report on the Ministry's budget to the Chamber of Deputies, which detailed the origins of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and analyzed the attitude adopted by the British government, stating, "Since the Franco-Italian agreement was concluded on January 7 of last year, before the British House of Commons held its general election (the event in November of last year), the British policy had already changed its direction. What is the reason for this? It will become clear in the future. Italy had already stopped raising requests to amend the distribution of mandated territories. However, Abyssinia's serious threat to the safety of Italy's East African colonies made Italy's development towards Abyssinia a matter of course. It is inappropriate for other countries to come out and block it, especially since Britain and France have encompassed all the mandated territories in the world, but want to hinder Italy's future. Is there any reason for this in terms of morality, law, or history?" The report also said, "The League of Nations' condemnation of our country's actions is actually a legal trick. It is appropriate for us to ignore it and not ask about it, even if it lasts for a hundred generations." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) A person from the Prime Minister's Office told a Reuters interviewer yesterday that there was no basis for the rumors that Germany was making military preparations in the western Austrian border area. He said that the Ministry of National Defense had recently guaranteed that there would be no extraordinary events in southern Bavaria this year. In addition, a large detachment of riflemen is currently conducting a ten-day exercise in Garmisch, and another 80 army sports leaders are participating in training in the Bavarian Alps. The peacetime troops currently stationed in Bavaria are indeed more numerous than during the period when compulsory military training was heavily enforced, but there is no extraordinary concentration of troops there. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign reports that Germany is preparing to occupy Austria by force have aroused great resentment here. Semi-official sources say that these reports are "malicious and clumsy tricks to poison the political atmosphere," and that these rumors "can prove that the sole purpose of the German government is to build peace in foreign policy and advocate amity in the European political situation, but in other respects, there are some authorities who want to create an atmosphere that plunges the political situation into turmoil." (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to well-informed sources here, the reason why the Austrian government transferred troops from Vienna and the east to the western provinces of Salzburg and Tyrol is that there is a risk of serious events occurring at any time in the current European international situation, so it is making preparations in advance. The rumors circulating that the troop movements were caused by an incident involving the Tyrol Home Guard are dismissed by the authorities as unfounded. There are currently 5,000 troops stationed in Tyrol, 80% above the normal number. In addition, two battalions of Styrian infantry have arrived at the town of Ried in Upper Austria, near the German border. According to a senior official, reinforcements will be stationed in western Austria for a long period during the spring and summer. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(London) The cabinet held a meeting at 10:00 AM today and submitted the British government's list of issues regarding the German memorandum for discussion. It is generally believed that this list of issues will be submitted to the German government. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The British cabinet today considered the questions to be submitted to Germany, hoping to gain a clearer understanding of certain points contained in the German memorandum. This document still needs to go through another cabinet meeting before it can be sent out. It is likely that it will be submitted to Germany tomorrow or Saturday. The signatories of the Locarno Pact previously proposed a solution to the West European situation to Germany, to which Germany responded. Its memorandum contained a general outline of a new peace plan. There seems to be no difference of opinion between Britain, France, and Belgium regarding the content of its questions. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Eden advocates drafting the questions in his own way, meaning that the questions raised by Britain will be moderate and constructive, but there should be no doubt about the points that Britain wants to clarify. It is generally known that the British questions will be largely the same as those speculated on April 24th, except that the colonial issue will not be raised, which is still undecided. It is likely that Britain will ask: Is Germany willing to modify the League of Nations Covenant before rejoining the League of Nations? Does Germany recognize the status of Danzig and Memel and the independence of Austria? Does Germany agree to include the declaration of a West European "sky agreement" in the negotiation of an air force limitation treaty? Is Germany willing to conclude non-aggression treaties with its eastern neighbors, but also recognizes the right of these countries to conclude mutual assistance agreements with their neighbors? Does Germany refuse to unilaterally abrogate treaties in the future? (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The list of questions that the British government should raise regarding the German memorandum of March 31st was finalized by Foreign Secretary Eden last night. After being approved by the cabinet tomorrow, it will be sent to Sir Phipps, the British ambassador to Germany, for transmission to the German government. Foreign Secretary Eden intends that this list of questions be issued as soon as possible so that the German government can submit its answers before the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council on September 11th. It is generally known that the questions raised by Britain have no threatening nature, but only ask Germany to explain its true intentions on the following points so as to facilitate the mediation work, such as: Regarding the League of Nations, will the League of Nations Covenant be separated from the Treaty of Versailles as a separate issue? Regarding the issue of West European security, will the bilateral non-aggression pact proposed by Germany be incorporated into the collective security mechanism? Cabinet members have fully agreed on the wording of the list of questions, but it has not yet been definitively decided whether the colonial issue should be raised. In addition, according to reliable sources, the Polish Chargé d'Affaires in Britain recently stated to Foreign Secretary Eden that issues purely involving Polish-German relations should not be included in the list of questions. It is also reported that Soviet Ambassador Maisky also explained to Eden that Germany's views on East European security must be explored, but according to semi-official sources, Britain does not intend to include this issue in the list of questions. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) When Prime Minister Baldwin answered a question from a member of parliament yesterday, he said, "The government has never considered the issue of transferring any mandated territories to other countries, nor is it discussing it at present." This is inconsistent with the actual situation learned by our reporter. According to our reporter, colonial experts have recently conducted in-depth research on how Britain can make concessions to Germany on the colonial issue without harming the interests originally maintained by the British Empire. The conclusions are as follows: The Tanganyika region (formerly belonging to Germany and now mandated to Britain by the League of Nations) runs through North and South Africa and occupies a key strategic position. Its military and economic relations are extremely important and cannot be transferred to Germany. British territories in East Africa, such as Kenya, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and Tanganyika, have similar characteristics and cannot be transferred to Germany. As for the parts of Southwest Africa that originally belonged to Germany, they are now governed by the Union of South Africa, which has long expressed its opposition to the transfer of jurisdiction. Britain should not overstep its authority. Therefore, the only colonies that Britain can consider transferring are Nigeria, the Gold Coast, and Sierra Leone in West Africa. Generally speaking, there should be no difficulties in transferring Nigeria and the Gold Coast to Germany. Germany was originally a major customer of the products produced in these regions, and it can be allowed to develop its influence there. The transfer proposal has symbolic significance, which is used to appease people so that the movement to revise the treaty will lose momentum. However, in view of the recent active activities of Germans in Southwest Africa, the country's former colony, people are deeply concerned that after the country restores its power in Europe, it may take violent actions in Africa, which is quite worrying. South African Minister of Defense Biro recently proposed a plan to strengthen national defense in Congress, which is nothing more than taking precautions. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Beijing: The so-called "Sickle and Hammer" movement initially seemed like a major political movement, but the result was just a farce. The leaders of this movement claimed that they would occupy the capital on May 1st, which was just empty talk. The beginning of this movement was due to the fact that after several failed elections, István Bús Szametz, a right-wing radical member of the Hungarian party, set up another banner to compete. His party members were all farmers and unemployed young people. In the past few weeks, they had several secret meetings. Bús armed his party members with private property and secretly trained them for military action, preparing for an uprising on May 1st. However, the police got wind of it first and arrested its leaders and ninety party members yesterday, imprisoning them behind bars. The so-called "weapons" of the party members were nothing more than "table knives," and the so-called uniforms were nothing more than military officer's coats purchased from old stores. The police also found that Bús still calls himself a "poet." (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(Paris) May 1st is the 50th Labor Day. The origin of this festival in the world originated in the United States. The American Labor Congress held a meeting in Pittsburgh in 1881 and proposed the "three-eight system" (eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest), and designated May 1st of each year as Labor Day. Five years later, in 1886, the first Labor Day commemoration was held, and it has been followed as an example every year since. Due to its influence, it has become popular in various countries. The French labor organization has traditionally been divided into two factions: the General Confederation of Labor and the Unified General Confederation of Labor. By March of this year, they merged into one, called the Unified General Confederation of Labor, and will hold the first congress in Toulouse. Labor Day this year is also the first since the establishment of the Unified General Confederation of Labor. The main leaders of the Unified General Confederation of Labor have issued a notice to all affiliated labor unions, urging them to hold many gatherings to celebrate the occasion. All cadres of labor unions and their members should participate and list the demands put forward by the working class, the most important of which are as follows: Implement a 40-hour work week; Laborers can sign collective contracts with employers; Implement the program of building public works proposed by the former General Confederation of Labor to relieve unemployment. It is generally believed that only private industries, the construction industry, and traveling car drivers will stop work on this day, while public utilities will continue to work as usual.

<p>(London) The Admiralty will issue a white paper today explaining the navy's plan to implement the new defense proposals this year, and will announce an additional budget of about 10 million pounds. This amount will be added to the additional 10 million pounds already announced for the air force. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) It was announced today that the supplementary naval budget for the current fiscal year is 10 million pounds. According to the 1936 plan, the navy will add 38 warships in addition to small warships. This budget is based on the defense policy explained in the white paper of March 3. The various warships to be built are as follows: 2 battleships, 5 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 1 aircraft carrier, 4 submarines (1 mine-laying submarine, 1 patrol submarine, 2 small submarines), 6 gunboats, 1 river gunboat, 2 special service ships, 6 motor torpedo boats, and other small warships. The supplementary budget also stipulates important improvement expenses for storing munitions, fuel, and other important military supplies. The needs of new air force equipment, such as new types of aircraft, are also stipulated. It is reported that the authorities have decided to install anti-aircraft guns on each ship as soon as possible. The funds for this purpose are also included in the supplementary budget for this session, and will continue to be handled in this way in the future. The four Hawkins-class cruisers currently equipped with 7.5-inch guns, which were listed as 8-inch gun cruisers under the 1930 London Naval Treaty, were originally scheduled to be dismantled by the end of this year, but it has now been decided to preserve them, and three of them will be converted to 6.1-inch guns and included in the B-class tonnage cruisers. One ship will be converted into an officer training ship and will not be used for war. The old aircraft carrier Argus has been converted into a training ship. All these changes have been notified to the signatories of the London Naval Treaty. The needs of the Singapore naval base have been carefully considered and it is believed that it should be further supplemented, so the expenditure has been increased from 8,693,000 pounds to 10,661,000 pounds. Dry docks capable of accommodating the largest ships will be built in Plymouth and Gibraltar. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's hope of being nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate is more assured today as a result of the primary elections in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania yesterday. As for the most noteworthy development in the political world, it is that the Republican Party has apparently begun to campaign to obstruct the power of Kansas Governor Landon. The results of yesterday's primary elections in the two states can increase the political disputes, but cannot indicate the direction of the Republican Party. The president and Landon both won victories in Massachusetts, but this cannot be regarded as a formal competition because the names of the candidates were not written on the ballot, and the voters had to write them themselves. Only Landon was campaigning in the state. The Republican Party in the state cast a total of 94,953 votes, Landon received 78,259 votes, former President Hoover received 7,812 votes, and Chicago publisher Knox received 2,102 votes. For the Democratic Party, President Roosevelt received 31,459 votes, Smith received 1,443 votes, and Father Coughlin received 993 votes. In Pennsylvania, a lawyer from New York, Blagden, received the support of conservatives and competed with President Roosevelt. Reports from about 5,000 of the 7,962 electoral districts in the state show that Roosevelt received 393,062 votes, and Blagden received only 23,472 votes. For the Republican Party, it was only Senator Borah, and there was no competition, and he received a total of 254,613 votes. However, the Republican Party in both states is not bound and can still elect others in the future, unlike the Democratic Party, which must elect President Roosevelt. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Emperor will issue an edict tomorrow convening a special session of parliament on May 4th. This is the first time in Japanese history that parliament has been convened under martial law. It is generally expected that this meeting will be very important, probably because it will discuss the expansion program of the army and navy. According to press reports, the naval budget for 1936-37 will be more than 600 million yuan, and the budget for 1937-38 will be 700 million yuan, and it will continue to increase thereafter. The replacement of battleships is not included in the naval program. The naval program includes: Reforming the national naval armaments based on the absence of treaty relations; Reforming the air force of the fleet; Building defense works at key points on the Pacific islands under Japanese jurisdiction. The pro-navy faction believes that the political situation in the Pacific will be disrupted in early 1937, so this project is really necessary. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government intends to ensure Japan's position as a force for stability in East Asia in order to actively promote world peace and human culture. It has abandoned the naval reduction treaty and abolished the principle of the open door. The Japanese Navy believes that in order to ensure Japan's future survival and realize the essence of being a force for stability in East Asia, the adjustment of the continental policy aimed at developing Manchuria and the maritime national policy with the highest goal of peace in the Pacific is an urgent task. Therefore, in the future, the three ministries of the army, navy, and foreign affairs plan to link the continental policy and the maritime policy together to establish a national policy as the foundation of Japan's domestic and foreign policies. The reason for establishing the maritime policy as an urgent task is that Japan has a narrow territory and a lack of natural resources, but its population is overpopulated and its growth rate is increasing. To solve this population problem, there is no other way than to transfer population, develop resources, and open up markets overseas. Therefore, the Ministry of the Navy, on the one hand, strengthens national defense and promotes the national spirit of overseas development. On the other hand, it pays attention to foreign countries and maintains diplomatic relations with countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean, adjusting conflicts of interest in commerce and trade. At the same time, it strengthens the administrative organs in the South Seas and Taiwan, supports commerce and trade, and develops maritime transport and fisheries in order to achieve the goal of overseas population transfer.

The association held a luncheon today, and Lord Strabolgi, a Labor member of the House of Lords, gave a speech, stating that "recent events in China will have a profound impact on the whole world. If we had a deeper understanding of the Chinese people before, then when Japan carried out aggression against China, British public opinion would have risen up to attack Japan, just as British public opinion rose up to attack the Hoare-Laval Pact to mediate the Italian-Abyssinian dispute at the end of last year." Afterwards, Chinese playwright Xiong Shi-i spoke, saying that China has not been understood by Western nations for a long time. "Britain and the United States are China's friendly countries, and we can certainly hope for their help, but our country itself must also be prepared to cooperate with other countries. We cannot be overly optimistic and hope that other countries will provide assistance." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Izvestia reported today that its Vladivostok correspondent said that Russian ships arriving at Japanese ports are always subjected to orderly harassment. All ships are inspected, and sailors, except for groups of five to ten people, are not allowed to disembark. Those who disembark are always followed by secret police. Captains are often forced to be closely monitored and are subjected to ill-treatment. However, Japanese ships arriving at Soviet Russian ports are treated the same as ships from other countries.

<p>(Washington) Senator King declared today that as a result of his talks with Chen Guangfu, a representative of the Chinese banking community, he learned that the silver issue was the main issue in the group's talks with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. As far as he knew, China seemed to want to restore the silver standard, so any results obtained from Chen Guangfu's talks with Morgenthau were to stabilize the monetary policies of the two countries. Senate silver leader Pittman also met with Chen on Tuesday at the Chinese Embassy, but said that he did not discuss any financial issues, so he could not express any opinions on the negotiations. However, he knew for sure that there was no agreement yet in the talks between Chen and Mao, and it must be submitted to the Senate for discussion. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The House today passed the government's $803,000,000 new tax bill, as originally proposed by the Democratic Party of the Finance Committee, by a vote of 267 to 112, and immediately sent it to the Senate for deliberation. Although the US Chamber of Commerce and Republican members of the House had fiercely criticized it beforehand, it was not passed in the end. Most Republican members did not vote. The Senate Finance Committee will begin its review tomorrow, and there may be some important revisions at that time. According to the plan passed by the House, it is stipulated that 62,000,000 yuan can be collected from the company's gross profit tax, 100,000,000 yuan from the business tax refunded when the Agricultural Adjustment Act expires, and about 83,000,000 yuan from the temporary continuation of the company's capital and excessive profit taxes. After the new tax bill is passed, the only bills that this session of the House must discuss are the naval budget bill and the additional relief budget bill. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Silk Manufacturers Association received a telegram from Bombay stating that the Indian Parliament would soon pass a bill to greatly increase the import tax on Japanese silk. It is said that the bill will stipulate that in addition to the current tariff of 25%, a special tax of 14 annas per pound will be added. In other words, the tax required for Japanese silk to be transported to India, calculated at the current value, will be no less than 567%. Such a heavy tax is tantamount to prohibiting the import of Japanese silk. The purpose of this bill is to protect the silk industry of Kashmir and Bengal. However, Japanese merchants say that Japanese silk does not compete with Indian silk because their uses are different. The Indian government's move to increase taxes is merely to use this as a tool for negotiating the expiring Indo-Japanese cotton trade agreement, and to give special preferential treatment to British silk imported into India. It is reported that in the year from April 1935 to March 1936, India imported 3 million pounds of silk from various countries, worth 7.8 million rupees, of which Japanese silk accounted for half, while British silk was only 500,000 pounds, worth 1 million rupees.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Commercial Survey Mission went to various countries in Central and South America last autumn, hoping to adjust Japan's commercial relations, but ultimately failed. Colombia has concluded a trade agreement with the United States and cannot accept Japan's early negotiations. Negotiations with Ecuador on the purchase of industrial salt were almost completed, but were still abandoned when officially signing the agreement. Oil purchase negotiations with Venezuela could not proceed due to the death of President Gómez and the instability of the political situation. As for coffee and coconuts produced in Santo Domingo, the Japanese hoped that trade with Japan would increase, but the movement to negotiate a commercial treaty was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Santo Domingo government even intended to increase import duties on Japanese goods. Imports of Japanese goods into Haiti are subject to a 100% ad valorem tax. The Haitian government claims that if Japan purchases cotton produced by Haiti worth 70 to 80 million yen annually, the import duty can be reduced appropriately. However, in reality, Japan cannot purchase cotton worth 70 to 80 million yen from Haiti every year. Among the above-mentioned countries that have a commercial treaty with Japan, Ecuador's treaty will also expire on May 15. Therefore, Japan's commercial relations with South America may ultimately not be able to make progress. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese business community expects the Tariff Investigation Committee to hold an extraordinary meeting tomorrow, advocating a 12% ad valorem tax on wool imported from Australia. The committee will invoke the Trade Protection Law to consider boycotting Australian wool and wheat, in retaliation for Australia's recent increase in import duties on Japanese cotton cloth and rayon. It is reported that in 1935, the goods imported by Japan from Australia were mostly raw wool, totaling 35 million yuan, while the goods exported by Japan to Australia totaled 75 million yuan.

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang instructed the military training students of various high schools in Jiangxi at Xishan on the afternoon of the 30th. Xiong Shihui, Qian Dajun, and more than 800 students stood respectfully to listen to the instructions for an hour. The main points of the instructions are as follows: The purpose of your training here is to save the country. All academic research, physical exercise, and spiritual and moral cultivation, etc., should all strive towards this goal. Not only should you make such purposeful efforts during military training, but you must also recognize the meaning of our lives and the purpose of our lives, so as to establish a revolutionary outlook on life. No matter when, where, or what, you should adhere to a firm belief, a correct direction, and an honest attitude, and follow the path of righteousness and brightness, and move forward bravely. You must not be confused, perfunctory, or procrastinate for a moment or a matter. You must know that the psychology and habits of perfunctory confusion are the root of self-destruction and national subjugation. We must fundamentally eradicate them, and then we can improve our virtue day by day and become glorious modern citizens. The content of so-called "military training," the study of all military academic subjects, is only a necessary part. Its most important task is the training of military spirit and the cultivation of personality. We should know that soldiers are the citizens with the highest personality, the strongest spirit, the most diligent life, the most ambitious aspirations, the most able to sacrifice for the country, and the most honorable and noble. The purpose of military training now is to cultivate this kind of truly militarized youth to be a model for the people and a vanguard for saving the country. How can a true military spirit and personality be cultivated? The primary condition is to strictly abide by discipline. This so-called "discipline" not only refers to all laws and military discipline, nor is it limited to a certain time and place for attending classes and drills. Its correct meaning is that our every move, every word, and every action should conform to the principles of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and follow a certain reasonable standard, no matter when, where, or what. In short, it is the strict regularization of our entire lives, which is true militarization. If we want to truly abide by discipline, so as to cultivate the highest personality and the strongest spirit of a true soldier, we must develop the ability to be autonomous and self-governing, and work hard to be cautious and sincere. We must first eradicate the evil thoughts of selfishness and self-interest, and establish the great ambition of saving the country and the people, so that our hearts are as bright as the blue sky and the white sun, and we have no shame in what we do, and everything can be told to others. Only in this way can we cultivate the spirit and personality of a soldier who stands upright between heaven and earth, and then we can be good citizens and strong soldiers of the country, and then we can accomplish the great cause of saving the country and reviving the nation. You students should encourage each other. (30th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the Organizational Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council closed last night, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Ambassador Guo Taiqi. According to his conversation, the representatives of the committee all felt that China's request to rejoin the Administrative Council was extremely reasonable and could prove that although the League of Nations is now in a precarious situation, China's belief in the League of Nations has not diminished. The current situation of the League of Nations is indeed extremely pessimistic. Not only has its international prestige declined, but its future fate is also unknown. However, if Asian countries are excluded from the Administrative Council for a long time, it will be detrimental to both the universality and consolidation of the League of Nations. Ambassador Guo finally said that he believes that the Administrative Council will accept the report of the Organizational Committee, and China is expected to rejoin the Administrative Council in September. (29th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The committee on the distribution of council member seats of the League of Nations Administrative Council has been meeting for days to discuss China's request for a council seat. A result has been reached. A public announcement has been issued by the Secretariat of the League of Nations, which reads, "The committee has decided to recommend to the Administrative Council that the number of non-permanent council seats be temporarily increased from nine to eleven until September 1939 (Note: The Administrative Council originally had five permanent council seats, namely the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Now Germany and Japan have withdrawn from the League, and the Soviet Union has been newly added, totaling four seats.) One of the two newly added seats is the one added in 1933 and currently occupied by Portugal, which should still be maintained. In the future, it will be granted to member countries outside of Europe that do not belong to any group (the so-called groups refer to the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Little Entente, Latin America, etc.). The second seat will be granted to countries on the Asian continent. In the committee's opinion, it can be granted to China. As for the term of the newly added council seats, some national representatives in the committee advocated a term of one year, so that the Administrative Council and the League of Nations General Assembly can have room for flexibility when the Administrative Council is engaged in a general reform in a short period of time. Other national representatives advocated a term of three years, which is the same as the usual term of non-permanent council members. However, during these three years, the Administrative Council can still be unrestricted if it is engaged in reorganization. As a result, the committee passed the second method with nine votes for, five votes against, and two abstentions." (29th Havas)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Philippine Overseas Chinese inspection group arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. Wang Quansheng, the leader of the group, said that there are more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Although they are far away from their home country, they are very patriotic and are very concerned about the situation in their home country. The biggest mission of this trip is to gather a group of people of insight to conduct on-site inspections of the various industrial and commercial construction projects in their home country in recent years, as well as party affairs, politics, military affairs, transportation, education, etc., and contribute the real situation they have heard and seen to the overseas Chinese, so that they can have a true understanding of their home country. In the past, when overseas Chinese saw that their home country was facing increasingly urgent foreign troubles and the people were suffering more and more, they immediately tightened their belts and enthusiastically supported them in order to achieve the glorious state of unifying the whole country. Now that the bandit communists are about to be wiped out, and when foreign troubles are becoming more and more serious, our overseas Chinese must contribute their great strength based on their past spirit of loving their home country. If the country is rich and strong and its capabilities increase, the international status of overseas Chinese will naturally be higher, and the suffering of overseas Chinese can also be gradually alleviated. Therefore, saving overseas Chinese is saving the country, and saving the country is saving overseas Chinese. All members of this group take this as their goal. After the group arrived in Nanjing, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent personnel to take care of them, and the municipal government sent Wei Changgeng to welcome them. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Ma Chaojun, Mayor of Nanjing, have all decided to hold banquets on the 1st and 2nd respectively. The group is scheduled to go to the mausoleum for worship at 9 am on the 1st, visit various party and government agencies in the afternoon, stay in Nanjing for a week, and then go to Suzhou and Hangzhou to visit before returning to Shanghai to wait for a ship back to the Philippines.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of changing the currency used on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway to yuan, it is understood that this matter is being studied by the Southern Section Bureau. Since Guangdong Province has always used silver dollars as the standard, if the currency is suddenly changed to yuan, it will still need to be calculated by converting it to small silver coins. Not only will passengers suffer losses, but the price will also fluctuate, and the conversion procedures and auditing will be troublesome. It is urgent to establish an appropriate conversion standard first. Once the decision is made, it can be submitted to the Ministry of Railways to be changed to the yuan system on a regular basis.

<h3 id="e61">Guangdong Province: Actively Developing the Sugar Industry; The Entire Province Divided into Five Sugarcane Cultivation Zones; Total Capital Reaches Over Nine Million Yuan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In light of the fact that China's sugar industry has been increasingly heading towards bankruptcy due to the dumping of foreign sugar and the impact of the global economic crisis, the Guangdong provincial authorities, recognizing that Guangdong Province has always been a major sugar-producing region in China and that the province should make the greatest efforts to revive the sugar industry, have designated sugar industry development as one of the important tasks in the first three-year administrative plan. After three years of implementation, the results have been quite considerable. It is noted that the three-year plan for sugar industry development involves first dividing the province into five sugarcane cultivation zones in areas suitable for sugarcane cultivation: Guangzhou Zone (Panyu, Dongguan, Shunde, Nanhai, and the Pearl River Delta); Huizhou-Yangjiang Zone (Huiyang, Boluo, Haifeng, Lufeng); Chaozhou-Shantou Zone (Chaoyang, Jieyang, Huilai, Puning); Xuwen Zone (Xuwen, Haikang); and Qiongya Zone (all counties under Qiongya). The first areas to be prepared and established are the Guangzhou, Huizhou-Yangjiang, and Chaozhou-Shantou zones. The current status of each of these zones is recorded below:</p>
<p>Guangzhou Zone: Sugarcane factories have been established in Xinzhao and Shitou, Panyu, respectively. Also, one factory each has been established in Shunde and Dongguan. (One factory each has been established in the Huizhou-Yangjiang and Chaozhou-Shantou zones.) The total cost of startup and temporary annual expenses reaches over 9,402,000 yuan. The Xinzhao sugar factory covers an area of 110 mu, and the cost of machinery and factory construction is estimated at 1,474,056 yuan. The Xinzhao factory is also equipped with an alcohol factory. The Shitou factory covers an area of 175 mu, and the cost of machinery and factory construction is estimated at 4,035,320 yuan. The Xinzhao and Shitou factories can each press 1,500 tons of sugarcane per day, equivalent to 16.8 dan per ton, for a total of approximately 25,200 dan of sugarcane pressed, producing 180 tons of sugar, equivalent to approximately 3,024 dan. The Shunde factory is located in Xiachun Village, opposite Rongqi in the county, covering an area of 250 mu. The construction cost is 376,200 Hong Kong dollars. The full set of sugarcane pressing machinery costs 140,000 British pounds. This machine can press 1,000 tons of sugarcane daily, producing over 100 tons of clean Java No. 24 white sugar. The construction cost of the Dongguan factory is 450,000 Hong Kong dollars. The entire set of machinery costs 140,000 British pounds, with an additional 1,700 British pounds for chemical laboratory instruments and light railways.</p>
<p>Huizhou-Yangjiang Zone: The construction site is located at Pingtan, 80 li from Huiyang, as the factory site. The cost of machinery factories and a 5,000-ton warehouse, including a full set of sugarcane pressing machinery, totals 700,000 US dollars, with an additional 27,921 US dollars for accessories. The alcohol machinery costs 194,229 Hong Kong dollars, with an additional 10,140 yuan for accessories. The Izatte machine costs 43,377 Hong Kong dollars. This factory can press 1,000 tons of sugarcane per day, equivalent to 16,800 dan, producing 100 tons of sugar, equivalent to 1,680 dan?</p>
<p>Chaozhou-Shantou Zone: The first sugarcane cultivation site is located in Guitou Village, Quxi, Jieyang, covering an area of over 120 mu. The cost of machinery and construction totals 552,000 US dollars. The factory can press 750 tons of sugarcane per day.</p>
<p>Xuwen Zone and Qiongya Zone: Still in the planning and preparation stages. Statistics on the sugar products produced in each zone include Grade A white sugar, Grade B white sugar, No. 1 coarse sugar, No. 2 coarse sugar, fire sugar, sugar frost, and cube sugar. The quality is better than that of imported products. In terms of sales and distribution, the provincial government has established a provincial product management office, dividing the province into eight operating zones. In Shanghai, there is also a Guangdong product management branch responsible for promoting Guangdong sugar to other provinces. Business is quite developed. In terms of personnel, each factory has hired foreign engineers from Honolulu, USA, and the Czech Republic to be responsible for the factory, and there are also mechanical and engineering students who have graduated from abroad and returned to assist in factory affairs. In addition, there are over 100 high school graduates interning at the factory. The Military Reclamation Office has also established a sugar industry personnel training institute at the Pingtan factory. After graduation, they will all serve in the factory. Once the engineering is proficient, each factory will no longer need to hire foreigners.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of raw material sugarcane, personnel have been sent to the Philippines to collect 52 kinds of excellent sugarcane varieties from that area. Several excellent sugarcane seedling propagation sites have been established throughout the province: Xinzhou Propagation Site, covering an area of 450 mu; Misha Propagation Site, covering an area of 120 mu; Chencun Propagation Site, covering an area of 400 mu; and Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Propagation Site, covering an area of 500 mu. The Huiyang factory has two sugarcane seedling sites, covering a total of 100 mu. Recently, it is planned to add another one, covering an area of 700 mu. In total, the propagation sites cover a total of 2,000 mu. The area operated by private individuals is not yet included. In total, there are approximately 8,000 mu of public and private newly planted sugarcane seedling propagation sites in the province, which is sufficient for 130,000 mu of sugarcane fields. These excellent sugarcane varieties can yield an average of 120 dan of sugarcane per mu, and 10 dan can produce 140 jin of sugar. Each mu of sugarcane can produce 15-16 dan of sugar. The program is still being actively promoted, and farmers are being assisted in propagation. According to this plan, if implemented step by step, the revival and development of Guangdong's sugar industry is inevitable, and the widespread planting of sugarcane fields by farmers will have a significant impact on the rural economy. Currently, the Guangdong authorities are conducting a detailed assessment of the achievements of the first three-year plan and preparing to formulate a second three-year plan for sugar industry development in order to achieve further success.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Guangdong Construction Department Stipulates: Private Enterprise Plans; Promoting the Realization of the Three-Year Plan; Guiding the People to Directly Run Real Industries; Assigning Subordinates to Draft Detailed Plans <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: He Qili, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Department, believes that as the second three-year plan for Guangdong Province is about to begin implementation, in order to plan for the program, the government should do its best to promote it on the construction side, and it is also extremely important to guide the people to directly manage it so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, he specifically ordered the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the Bureau of Port Affairs, the Industrial Testing Institute, the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Management Committee, and the fifth section of the department, as well as technician Yu Ji, to draft private enterprise plans as a standard for compiling the second three-year plan. The original order stated, "Our country's science is backward, and the production industry is far inferior to others. The outflow of money every year is truly alarming. Even agriculture, which is said to be the foundation of our country, is stuck in the old ways of production methods, and the output is not abundant, and a large amount needs to be imported. Not to mention the others. In addition, in recent years, countries around the world have been affected by the recession, and each has adopted a policy of dumping at low prices, using our country as the end of their surplus products. As a result, the collapse of our country's rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce are increasing day by day. In this situation, how can the national economy and the people's livelihood not decline day by day? The provincial government has taken this into account and has formulated a three-year administrative plan, with particular emphasis on the path of real industry construction. During these three years, the scale has been roughly established, and those that are relatively complicated and have not yet been completed are also proceeding step by step to achieve success as scheduled. Among them, the scale is relatively large and inconvenient for private operation, so the government first organizes them to show its promotion. However, in recent years, private real industries have not seen any progress. The reason is that most businessmen lack technical knowledge, so they are not willing to try easily. In order to revive the agricultural, forestry, and sericulture industries in the five provinces and develop various new industries, the department should proceed with what should be done on the government side, and especially guide the people to directly run it, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, the department has determined the items of various construction projects and designated personnel to be responsible for drafting construction plans separately, so that if the people want to run any industry, they can use this as a bridge. The items and responsible personnel are listed as follows: Forestry, fishery, and water conservancy are the responsibility of the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry; shipping is the responsibility of the Bureau of Port Affairs; sericulture and weaving and dyeing are the responsibility of the Sericulture Improvement Bureau; chemical industry and leather manufacturing are the responsibility of the Industrial Testing Institute; the electrical industry is the responsibility of the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Management Committee; the mining industry is the responsibility of the fifth section of the department; and agricultural tool manufacturing, oil pressing, and stationery manufacturing are the responsibility of Yu Ji, a technician of the department. Among the above plans, the required items must be thoroughly investigated to ensure that they are practical, so that the people can see them and put them into practice without any hindrance, and within the possible scope, the size of their scale should be distinguished separately, and two plans should be drafted for the same industry, so that those who intend to run it but have less capital can also benefit from it. The above-mentioned designated personnel must follow this purpose and draft and submit detailed plans within two months of receiving the document for review and publication. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to order you to comply immediately, this order."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provinces: Specialty Products Exhibition Begins; A Total of Eleven Departments of Exhibits; More Than 10,000 Kinds of Local Specialties <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: In order to promote economic cooperation, the authorities of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces have initiated a joint exhibition of specialty products. The Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commerce and Administration drafted a plan, which was submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for approval and obtained the consent of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council. The first preparatory meeting was held in Yushan, and the charter of the conference, the opening date, the cost sharing, and the free transportation were approved. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Association for the Promotion of National Products initiated a national products exhibition. Because the aims were the same, they joined and merged the organization. A preparatory office was established, and committees, sponsors, and staff were appointed to begin handling manufacturer registration and soliciting exhibits. The National Products Exhibition Hall on Yingzi Road and the buildings of the Bureau of Commerce and Administration were selected as venues. After active preparation and arrangement, everything is ready.</p>
<p>Exhibits: The exhibits include all the products of the counties in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, as well as other national products. There are a total of more than 10,000 kinds. The exhibition hall is divided into eleven departments, with a total of forty-five rooms. The first department displays embroidery and silk fabrics. The second department displays new and old medicines, educational supplies, and paper. The third department displays ham, dried white fish, lotus root flour, water shield, and other foods. The fourth department displays cosmetics, artworks, scissors, fans, condensed milk, etc. The fifth department displays copper, tin, porcelain, swords, rattan and bamboo ware, and food and beverages. The sixth department displays silks and satins from various counties. The seventh department displays specimens from the Entomology Bureau and local products along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The eighth and ninth departments are entirely for the display of national products. The tenth department displays agricultural products, minerals, aquatic products, and models of the Qiantang River Bridge. The eleventh department displays silk, cocoons, and satin produced in Hangzhou. All the items are extremely precious, such as Du Jinsheng's silk fabrics, the paper from Yuhang, Jiangshan, and Quzhou counties, the ham from Dongyang, the dried fish from Yongjia, the tea from Longjing and Tianmu, the scissors from Zhang Xiaoquan, the face powder from Kong Fengchun, the fans from Shu Lianji, the Longquan swords, the Jianhu yellow wine, the Huzhou zongzi, the Hangzhou silk and satin, and other agricultural products, which are provided by the Provincial Rice and Wheat Farm and the Cotton Farm, and minerals and aquatic products, which are sent by the Mineral Resources Survey Institute and the Aquatic Products Testing Ground for display. All the products of Zhejiang can be seen at a glance, and the production capacity can also be inspected once, which is quite meaningful compared with other national products exhibitions.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The conference venue is decorated quite luxuriously. The opening time is 2:00 p.m. on May 1st. Wu Tingyang, Director of the Construction Department, serves as the chairman of the conference. Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Provincial Government, also attended and gave a speech. At the same time, the conference invited famous party and government figures in the province to take turns giving speeches on the significance of the specialty products exhibition on the provincial radio station.

<h3 id="e64">Anhui Tea Export Registration; Preparing to Control Wholesale in the Province; Seven Registration Locations Set Up <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: During the tea sales season in Anhui Province last year, the Finance and Construction Departments jointly established tea export registration offices in the border areas to clarify the sales situation in preparation for improving tea. As a result, a portion of Qihong tea this year was able to be preliminarily loaned based on the registered quantity last year, and the government supervised the sales. Now, new tea is pouring out and is starting to proceed. Considering that tea is the largest agricultural product in Anhui Province and is mostly sold abroad, its prosperity and decline are not only related to the rural economy of Anhui Province but also to China's foreign trade. Last year, due to various obstacles in the mainland due to weather and human affairs, the output was not strong. Although the registration system was established, the actual sales situation was still not fully understood. This year, the two departments will first supervise and sell Qimen black tea. If the trial is effective, next year they will further plan and proceed in the entire Anhui tea area. Recently, after the Qingming Festival, tea has been launched on the market, and the time for sales and export has arrived. The establishment of the registration office is more important than last year, and it cannot be delayed. However, due to the changes in Qihong and local transportation, the location and organization of the office should be slightly changed compared to last year. This year's tea business tax has already been set up and levied, and the establishment of various registration offices at the same time will also be beneficial to the inspection of tax revenue. The registration office organization location and the expenses to be paid have been made into a table, and registration methods and notification formats have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government's 538th standing meeting for approval and implementation. The directors of the respective offices have been appointed to start operations separately. Herewith, the registration methods are attached and ordered to Wuhu. Datong. The two public security bureaus and the Xuanzhou. Hefei. Huaiyuan. And other county governments, first jointly with the directors of the registration offices, record and announce to the tea merchants to fill out the application form when reporting taxes, and report to the registration office when transporting them for export. At the same time, they are divided into various departments to carefully maintain them. The registration locations are Wuhu. Xuanzhou. Street entrance. Daohu. Datong. Huaiyuan. Sanhe and other seven locations. The expenses for six months are estimated at 10,200 yuan. (April 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Anyang Excavation Team Unearths Site of Yin Dynasty Architecture; Also Unearths Skeletal Remains of Ancient Race <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Anyang Correspondence: The Anyang Yin Ruins Excavation Team of the Institute of History and Language of the Academia Sinica has been collecting since 1928. Until last winter, there were twelve collections. This spring is the thirteenth collection of excavations, which will be hosted by Guo Ziheng, Li Chunyi, Gao Xiaomei, Wang Zixiang, Yin Ziwen, Pan Shijun, and Shi Zhangru, seven staff members sent by the institute, and Sun Wenqing from the Henan Museum sent by the Henan Provincial Government will participate in the excavation. Work began on March 19th and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. However, depending on the work situation, the time may be extended. Initially, only 60 to 70 workers were used, but now, due to the large area, there are already 100 workers. In the future, the number of workers required for the work will increase even more. The address is located in the northeast of Xiaotun Village, west of Anyang City, on the west bank of the Binhe River, which is high and has sticky soil. Since the start of work, the excavation area is 7 to 8 mu. The purpose is to clarify the entire architectural map of the Yin Ruins. If gray pits and tomb passages are encountered, they will also be excavated incidentally, so the unearthed items are less than the previous collections. The pottery, shells, bones, and stones that have been excavated so far are not particularly unique. In the excavated area, in addition to the mixed and messy gray pits and Tang Dynasty tomb passages, a small part of the Yin Dynasty palace foundation and cemetery have been exposed. The two places are more than a hundred steps apart. The cemetery is in the south. Six tomb pits have now been excavated, arranged in east-west rows, in two rows. Each pit is full of white bones, lying face up, lying face down, squeezed into the pit, about six or seven people. Judging from the situation, this cemetery is a mass burial pit from the Yin Dynasty or after the Yin Dynasty. The skeletons in the pit are all intact, and they are thought to be buried with the emperor after his death, or they were prisoners of war or rebels who were executed and buried there. After the skeletons are taken out, the anthropology team of the institute will measure their skulls to study the evolution and development of human brains in history. Many stone blocks of column bases and ancient wall engineering have been exposed at the palace site. The wall foundations are arranged vertically and horizontally in rows, with varying widths and narrowness, all of which are remnants of the main hall and side rooms. Many of the wall or column bases have been destroyed by the tomb passages of the Tang Dynasty. The construction of Tang Dynasty tombs was different from that of modern times. The tomb passages were dug from the ground, the coffins were placed in the cave, and the tombs were sealed, so the walls of the Yin Ruins were destroyed a lot. In addition to each person taking care of a pit during the excavation, the staff of the team spends most of their time organizing, washing, numbering, and packing the antiques. They get up at 5:00 every morning, and the work is extremely intense. (April 27th)</p>

<p>The Su Lun Yarn Factory outside Panmen, due to a conflict between female worker Jiang Fengying and Zhu Yindi, involved the factory director and the director of factory affairs, resulting in mutual accusations of defamation, obstruction of freedom, and damage. Yesterday (30th) was the date for the public trial by the local court. The court tried the two cases of Jiang Fengying accusing Zhu Yindi of obstructing freedom and Zhu Yindi accusing Jiang Fengying of obstructing freedom and damage. Zhu Yindi, accompanied by her mother Zhu Jiang, and defense lawyer Huang Jue, and Jiang Fengying, accompanied by her mother Jiang Zhu, and defense lawyers Liu Zuwang and Liu Zuyin, reported one after another. At 10:00 a.m., female judge Chen Ziguan opened the court for trial. According to Jiang Fengying, Zhu Yindi and her mother scolded her for being the concubine of the four young masters (i.e., factory director Yan Xinqi) and Pu Liangyuan (i.e., director of factory affairs), and demanded that they publish an apology in the newspaper for one month and compensate for the loss of reputation of one yuan. Zhu Yindi also stated that Jiang Fengying asked her to marry Pu Liangyuan, and she refused, holding a grudge. She ganged up with her mother Jiang Zhu and other eight people to rush to her home and smash tables, benches, bowls, and other items, demanding that they publish an apology in the newspaper for seven days and compensate for the damaged items. After a debate between the two sides, it was decided to announce the verdict on May 7th. Zhu Yindi and her mother were released on bail, and the rest were ordered to return. As for the two cases of Yan Xinqi and Pu Liangyuan separately accusing Zhu Yindi of defamation, there is no date for the hearing yet. The society has paid a lot of attention to this case, so the gallery was extremely crowded when the court opened yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Wuxi: County Government Security Team Makes Earnest Contact <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi District Administrative Inspector and District Security Commander believes that although the county government and the security brigade have different institutions and responsibilities, local administration and local military affairs should originally be in contact to cooperate with each other. However, since the county magistrate no longer concurrently served as the brigade commander, the organizational system is not connected, and the powers are not concentrated. He is deeply afraid that the contact will be lost over time, reducing administrative efficiency. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the counties under his jurisdiction and the security brigade commander that they should make earnest contact with each other on county administration and security team affairs in the future to achieve the effect of mutual assistance. He also stipulated four measures to achieve consistency. The measures are as follows: Although the team affairs of each county are routine and minor, if any contact occurs, it must be handled in writing; the county government and security team should report to the district command for approval to add or transfer security squadron platoons; if the brigade headquarters is stationed in County A and the squadron platoon is stationed in County B, if it is necessary to transfer them, it should consult with the County B government and obtain its consent, and report to the district for approval before implementation; the headquarters will simultaneously order the relevant county governments to investigate the dispatch matters of the security teams under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Recently, the weather has turned better, and the rainfall has been even, and the mulberry leaves have developed luxuriantly. Spring sericulture is progressing step by step and has reached the common breeding period. At present, most of the early-stage spring silkworms in each village have been collected in the past two days. The silkworms are in very good condition. The remaining late-stage spring silkworms must also be collected uniformly within the next week. The staff of the model sericulture zone, the central guidance office in each district, and the sub-guidance office in this county have been busy with guidance work in recent days. The output this year will definitely increase by more than 30% compared to previous years, so the future market price of mulberry leaves will definitely be expensive. At present, the leaf price in the southern village has reached about 2 yuan per dan.</p>

Please send a team to arrest him quickly. After receiving the report, Captain Zhong immediately sent detective Dai Qian, along with detectives Zhang Xiaodi and others, to arrest him, as the bandit had been wanted twice before. As a result, Wang was arrested. After interrogation, he confessed that he had robbed farm families in Xiajia Bridge, Nanhua Garden, and Xicang with Wang Er, Tang Heshang, Wang Meisheng, and others. Yesterday (30th), he was transferred to the county government and then transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Xinchengkui Lumberyard, located along the Nanhe River outside the West Gate of Wuyi, is owned by Yu Mairu from Anhui. His family lives to the south of the lumberyard. At approximately 2:00 AM on the 29th, seven or eight bandits suddenly entered the premises, each carrying box guns and flashlights. They searched and looted the place, first going to the bedroom of Yu Mairu's niece, but found nothing. They then went to Mairu's bedroom and demanded silence, robbing him of 105 silver dollars, gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and other items, estimated to be worth several hundred dollars. Yu's niece seized the opportunity to hide in the lumberyard and report the crime. The lumberyard workers immediately armed themselves and went to the roof. Realizing the danger, the robbers fled with their loot. Afterwards, the local Public Security First Sub-station reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, requesting police assistance in the pursuit. At dawn, employee Cui Yulin and others chased a man to the vicinity of Dongdai Town, where he fled into the river to hide. They captured him and took him to the station, where he confessed to the robbery and implicated several accomplices. The police are currently intensifying their search.</p>

<p>Jiang Rou’er and others from Xihu Village in Hubin Township, Zhenjiang County, built a dam to divert the flow of the Central River, obstructing the irrigation of Huangling and other townships in this county, causing disputes. Zhu Changfa and others from Huangling Township had submitted a petition to the district office, requesting it to be forwarded to the Provincial Construction Department to order the Zhenjiang County government to demolish the dam. Unexpectedly, the weather has been overcast and rainy in recent days, with thunderstorms and flash floods. The water level in the Central River has risen sharply. Due to the earthen dam built by Jiang Kao’er and others from Xihu Village in Zhenjiang County, the water flow could not be discharged, causing it to overflow onto the banks. This has resulted in the flooding of over a thousand acres of farmland on both sides of the river in Huling, Xihu Village, and Malinghou Maling Village in this county. Currently, the township head and the flooded landowners are submitting a petition to the county government requesting relief.</p>

<p>The Hongshengxiang Cigarette and Paper Shop on Boxian Road in Zhenjiang caught fire at approximately 9:00 PM last night (the 29th) due to careless electrical wiring. The fire spread to the neighboring Mingji Laundry and the Xinchang Clock Repair Shop. When the fire broke out, Zhang Yanqing, the owner of Hongshengxiang, rushed upstairs to salvage items and was surrounded by flames, unable to escape. He was later rescued, but his head was burned, and his body was severely charred. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment, where his life is in critical danger. At the same time, Chen Qishan and his wife, the owners of Mingji Laundry, were playing nearby when the fire started. Only their five-year-old daughter was sleeping upstairs. Due to the lack of time for rescue, the child was burned to death on the spot. After firefighters from various fire brigades fought to extinguish the blaze, it was finally put out at approximately 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Beijige Pavilion in Tongcheng is built on the north gate of Bizhai, a remote location rarely visited by people. Recently, the ring road around the city was constructed, and the number of visitors has gradually increased. The abbot, Monk Xintian, was demolishing a hole in the city wall because people were climbing onto the pavilion. On the morning of the 28th, while cutting through the thorns to block the hole, a snake's head as large as a fist suddenly emerged from the wall hole and exhaled at the monk before retracting. The monk was frightened and fell to the ground, his body swollen, and his life may be in danger.</p>

<p>The weather in Xiaoshan had been mild in recent days, and most of the silkworms in the surrounding villages had hatched. Silkworm farmers in Chexiang had begun feeding the silkworms, and most of the early batches had already entered their first molt. However, starting on the 26th, there were three days and nights of heavy rain, and a strong northwest wind suddenly caused the weather to turn cold. Most of the hatched young silkworms froze to death, and the early batches in their first molt mostly stopped eating. The continuous rain also caused the mulberry leaves to be waterlogged, and the silkworms were spitting out yellow water. This year's silkworm season does not look promising. Although the improved breed is more resistant to cold, sick silkworms have been found, reducing the harvest by half. There is little hope for a good harvest this season.</p>

<p>To the Editors of the Shanghai Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Last year, Xinye County experienced unprecedented flooding, which destroyed not only homes and fields, but also nearly a century of accumulated wealth. The people are suffering from both hunger and drowning, and the situation is dire. Fortunately, we were rescued by philanthropists from all over the world, and we were able to survive last autumn and winter by eating bran and grass. Since the beginning of spring, relief supplies have been exhausted, and there is almost no smoke rising from the chimneys. Throughout the disaster area, not a single chicken or dog can be heard. The trees have been stripped bare, and the walls are empty. Skinny children lean on their emaciated mothers and weep, while starving husbands lie beside the villages, waiting for death. With the gap between the old and new harvests, rice prices are soaring, which is a death sentence for the dying victims. Although an empty stomach can endure for a limited time, the spring breeze cannot alleviate hunger. Our association has no magical powers to raise money, and we are both knowledgeable and capable but are facing difficulties. In our mind's eye, we see corpses dying of starvation, and in our ears, we hear cries of hunger. We are filled with anxiety day and night, and our hearts ache. Although beans and wheat will be harvested soon, the wait is unbearable. This group of people, who are difficult to serve, although born in deep water and bitter cold, will lose their lives in late spring and early summer. Your newspaper is widely circulated both at home and abroad, reaching every corner of the world. Therefore, we dare to represent the victims and appeal to you. Please lend a hand and publish our plea in your newspaper so that philanthropists at home and abroad can understand the urgent need for rescue in Xinye County and generously contribute to save us. If Xinye can reduce the loss of one life, it will increase the vitality of the entire society. The words of the benevolent are more valuable than cash. We implore you with a hundred bows and await your kind response.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhao Guanjun, Chairman of the Xinye County Disaster Relief Association</p>

<p>Open Letter to Workers: The China Labor Association's Open Letter to the National Labor Community</p>
<p>As we commemorate the 51st anniversary of the International Labor Day, we respectfully offer five points to our countrymen: First, the International Labor Day was born out of the struggle of international workers, especially American workers. The outcome of the International Labor Day is the herald of victory for the international workers' movement. As such, the significance of our commemoration of the International Labor Day lies in strengthening the organization and unity of the labor community. Second, we must remember the temporal and spatial context of China when we celebrate the International Labor Day. It is undeniable that in this peak stage of the Chinese national revolution, the promotion of the labor movement is of paramount importance. However, the method of promotion must be in line with the goals of the Chinese national revolution and suitable for the needs of the Chinese labor movement. Therefore, we must not blindly follow others when commemorating Labor Day. We must create a Chinese Labor Day with the spirit of "self-reliance" and use it as a model for the Chinese workers' movement. Third, we must promote the spirit of labor service when commemorating Labor Day. On the negative side, we must eliminate the bad habits of laziness, slackness, despondency, and decadence. On the positive side, we must use the perseverance of hard work, sacrifice, and labor service to increase the production of the nation and cultivate a militarized, artistic, and disciplined lifestyle. Fourth, we must work quickly to catch up with the national salvation movement and prepare for the work of extraordinary times in order to fight for the final survival of the nation. Fifth, the promotion of the labor movement is not only reflected in actions and forms, but also in the creation of spirit and substance. The former depends on the strictness of the organization, while the latter depends on the construction and popularization of labor culture. "Building labor culture" is also the most important mission of commemorating Labor Day. What has been said above are all the goals proclaimed in the outline of our association's work, and they are also the beliefs that we are all striving to achieve. We hope that the national labor community will work together to accomplish the mission of the Chinese Labor Day.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 28th meeting at the China National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road at 4:30 PM on the 29th. Committee members present included Cai Zengji, Song Ziliang, Bei Songshen, Xi Demao, Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Wang), Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong, and Zhang Peishen (represented by Xi). Chairman Cai Zengji reported on the daily affairs of the association. Ten applications for small credit loans were submitted, and after review, it was decided to approve loans totaling RMB 12,900. Twelve other applications were rejected because their businesses did not meet the loan principles or because the intended use of the loans did not comply with the regulations. The applicants will be notified of the decisions. According to the association's authorities, whom a reporter from Xin Xin She interviewed yesterday, although newspaper reports and repeated verbal instructions from the association's staff have emphasized that the application amount should not exceed half of the capital, as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, there are still those who falsely fill out the forms in an attempt to borrow more money. However, their efforts are futile. Every application received by the association is first reviewed by representatives of various banks. If it is deemed loanable, it will be investigated. After the investigation is completed, it will be reviewed again before being submitted to the meeting for review and decision. Although the process takes a little longer, it is necessary to be careful in handling public funds. Therefore, all applications that do not comply with the Ministry's regulations will be rejected, and those who falsely report their capital will have their loan amounts reduced. To reiterate, those who wish to apply for a loan should go to the association's office upstairs at the China National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road to obtain a form. Be sure to inquire about the procedures in detail and do not follow the path of deceiving yourself and others.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the British-owned Meihua Bank, which officially opened on April 8, specializing in all banking business with a capital of RMB 1 million registered in Hong Kong, has not joined the Foreign Bankers Association or the Shanghai Banking Association. After a run on the bank occurred a few days ago, it temporarily suspended business on the 28th. Chairman Jairo and others tried to raise funds and originally planned to resume business at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon.

<h3 id="e87">Agricultural Foundation Bureau's Outline Slightly Modified, Capital Increased to 60 Million Yuan, Minister Wu to Convene Second Discussion Meeting the Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce plans to establish an Agricultural Foundation Bureau to rescue rural areas and revive industry. After obtaining the consent of the Shanghai banking community, it has formulated a general outline of measures and is now soliciting opinions from the banking community in order to formulate detailed organizational measures. It has been learned that the original outline has been slightly modified, and the banks have been notified to convene a meeting on the 2nd to discuss everything. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions: When Minister of Industry and Commerce Wu Dingchang first convened the banking community to discuss the establishment of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, many bankers were unable to attend due to the spring holidays. The Bankers Association sent a letter to various banks to solicit their opinions, which were to be sent to the association by May 15 so that they could be compiled and sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. A general meeting will then be convened to discuss the implementation.</p>
<p>Increasing Capital: Minister Wu came to Shanghai a few days ago and invited bankers who study agricultural economics, including Zou Bingwen, Wang Zhixin, Zhang Xinyi, and Li Zhongchu, to discuss the matter. The original outline of measures was modified. The bureau's capital was originally set at 30 million yuan, with the government allocating 6 million yuan annually for five years. The circulating funds had no fixed amount and would be invested by participating banks. Now, the fixed capital has been increased to 60 million yuan, with the government contributing 30 million yuan, which will still be allocated over five years. The remaining 30 million yuan will be called joint venture capital and will be paid by participating banks over five years.</p>
<p>Adding Directors: The bureau originally had 13 directors, but this has now been increased to 21. The government will select 11 directors, and participating banks will nominate 10 directors. Other articles have also been modified and have now been sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Bankers Association for distribution to various banks for their information so that they can propose their opinions based on the outline. It has also been learned that Minister Wu will convene a second discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, and the association has notified the banks to send representatives to attend.</p>

Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Disconnected Users Quickly Register:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Telephone Problem Committee of the Special District issued a notice to all telephone users who have disconnected their phones: "Since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented an illegal price increase, society has been in turmoil. We have repeatedly negotiated with the Municipal Council to request measures to stop it. However, the Municipal Council has used the signed franchise agreement as the basis, ignoring the calls of society, which is regrettable. Now, users in various districts, in order to resist the company's unreasonable price increase, have refused to pay fees and are disconnecting their phones. In order to clarify the number of disconnections so as to make an effective protest, we hereby notify all users in various districts that if they have disconnected their phones in opposition to the company's price increase, they should fill in the phone number, account name, and damage comparison table within two weeks and send them to the Telephone Problem Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the Tianhou Palace. This matter concerns the public interest, so please do not delay."</p>
<p>Report Company's Inaccurate Metering:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the committee received a letter from Shenzhou Pharmacy at 492 Tianjin Road, which stated: "Our pharmacy installed a phone on April 6. On the 26th, we received a bill from the Shanghai Telephone Company, which stated that there was a call to the Chinese area on March 22, costing 5 cents. We checked and found that our pharmacy had not yet installed a phone in March, so how could there be a call? We sent someone to negotiate with the company, and an employee named Wei admitted that the metering was incorrect and agreed to cancel the charge. This shows that the company's usual metering is indeed inaccurate. In addition to refusing to pay the fee and sending a letter to the company to disconnect the phone immediately, we are writing to your committee to investigate and ask you to launch a firm protest in order to achieve the goal of canceling the unreasonable per-call metering."</p>

<h3 id="e89">Various Industries Stably Weather the End of April Period; Most Expiring Loans are Rolled Over; New Loans and Recovered Loans are Few <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the end of the fourth month period for industrial and commercial loans in Shanghai. The long-term credit loans extended by various banks and firms to industrial and commercial enterprises, which amounted to a total of 50 million yuan, were mostly held by money shops. In order to tighten credit, the various banks and firms originally intended to recover a portion of these loans. However, upon the request of the borrowing industrial and commercial firms, they were granted a special rollover to the end of October. The borrowers paid the interest in full, but the amount recovered was only about 10 to 20 percent. As for the loans extended in Shanghai by Ningbo banks, which amounted to a total of 15 million yuan, many Ningbo banks had closed down after the financial turmoil. Therefore, there was an intention to recover all these loans, but in the end, only 20 to 30 percent were recovered. Moreover, many money shops had already closed down themselves, and their loans had not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>Very Few New Loans Extended Money shops mostly extend long-term loans for six months, with periods ending in late April and late October each year. The interest rates are higher from November to April due to supply and demand, and slightly lower from May to October. The monthly interest rates vary from 8.5% to 1.5%, depending on the borrower's creditworthiness. This year, all money shops have uniformly tightened credit, so the amount of new long-term credit loans extended at the end of April was very small. Moreover, the spring silk and new wheat will soon be on the market, and the various money shops are particularly cautious about extending credit for silk and wheat purchases. However, fourteen banks, including the Bank of Communications, have jointly established a syndicate to handle a large-scale 30 million yuan loan for silk purchases.</p>
<p>Various Banks and Firms are Cautious About Discounting Bills</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various money shops were particularly busy with the collection and settlement of accounts for the end of April. Internal office hours were also extended. The interest on fixed deposits of various shareholders was settled according to the internal market rates. The call loan rate in the money market yesterday was still 8% per thousand yuan per day. The reason for this is that the various banks and firms are particularly cautious about discounting bills in order to avoid risks. They will not discount bills from non-creditworthy counterparts and prefer to deposit most of their funds in reserve. As for the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Treasury of Money Shops, they have ample reserves and are making every effort to regulate the finances of member banks and money shops.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Bureau of Industry and Commerce and Rickshaw Merchants Discuss Outstanding Cases Yesterday; The Public Works Department Decides to Reduce Rent According to Regulations; the Bureau Agrees in Principle to Reorganize the Mutual Aid Society <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Settlement and rickshaw merchants held a joint meeting at the Public Works Department at 9:45 AM yesterday to resolve disputes in the rickshaw industry. The Public Works Department was represented by Fessenden, Phillips, Massey, Hodekui, and Zhu Maocheng, and the rickshaw merchants were represented by Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Gu Songmao, Kunyi, and Ma Xianshi. Fessenden chaired the meeting. First, Yin Zhiling, the representative of the rickshaw merchants, stated the opinions of the rickshaw merchants: 1. Regarding the rent reduction issue, it is believed that the Public Works Department violated the "86 Agreement" of 1934. Rickshaws in the Public Settlement have licenses from the Chinese, French, and British settlements. The Public Works Department of the Public Settlement has no right to unilaterally stipulate rickshaw rent. Rickshaw rent is equivalent to general housing rent and land rent, and cannot be compared with the relationship between public buses and passengers. It is questionable whether the Public Works Department has the right to stipulate it. The rickshaw merchants cannot maintain their capital. The representative of the Public Works Department stated that although the rickshaw merchants' statements were very reasonable, the Public Works Department's regulations on rickshaw rent are based on the license regulations, and the 1934 agreement is not enough to restrict the Public Works Department's changes. The Public Works Department believes that it has the right to stipulate license regulations and has the right to consider issuing licenses to those who obey the license regulations at any time, and is unwilling to consider other issues. The rickshaw merchants stated that they reserve the right to protest so that they can negotiate at any time. 2. Regarding the Mutual Aid Society issue, the rickshaw merchants stated that since the Mutual Aid Society is not a charitable organization, the Public Works Department should not interfere. Now the rickshaw pullers have stated that they are unwilling to continue paying the mutual aid fee, and the rickshaw owners are only willing to pay the license fee of 2 yuan and 9 cents from next month and stop collecting the mutual aid fee on their behalf. However, the Public Works Department did not provide a reply in its letter to the rickshaw merchants, which means it is acquiescing. The representative of the Public Works Department replied that it was not acquiescing, but hoped to discuss it as much as possible at the meeting. The Public Works Department believes that it is very difficult to abolish the Mutual Aid Society immediately, but if the rickshaw merchants have a more complete solution, the Public Works Department is willing to accept it. The representative of the rickshaw merchants stated that the Mutual Aid Society's charging of fees to rickshaw pullers is contrary to the original purpose of helping rickshaw pullers, and the undertakings of the Mutual Aid Society have caused disputes due to their lack of universality. In the future, funds should be allocated separately for the Mutual Aid Fee. If the Public Works Department is unwilling to bear this expense, the rickshaw merchants are willing to bear it. However, in the future, the work of the Mutual Aid Society should be handled by a third party who is unrelated to both the Public Works Department and the rickshaw merchants so that it can be fair and impartial. The representative of the Public Works Department believes that this proposal is very sympathetic. If it is chaired by a public third party and the economy is guaranteed, the Public Works Department is very sympathetic. However, specific measures need to be discussed with the representatives of the rickshaw merchants. The rickshaw merchants stated how to deal with the problem of license donation in May if rickshaw pullers do not pay the Mutual Aid Society fee. The Public Works Department stated that the old regulations are still valid before the new regulations are implemented. The rickshaw merchants believe that how to deal with it if rickshaw pullers are unwilling to pay. The Public Works Department replied that if rickshaw pullers are unwilling to pay, rickshaw merchants should urge them to pay. The rickshaw merchants stated that this point needs to be solicited from all rickshaw pullers before a decision can be made. 3. Registration of rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw merchants claimed that the Public Works Department has not yet indicated how many rickshaw pullers are limited. The Public Works Department once stated that it authorized the rickshaw committee to register the number of people required by the rickshaw merchants, but the rickshaw committee caused disputes because it failed to register as much as possible. The chairman of the rickshaw committee, Massey, replied that the rickshaw committee is only prepared to continue registering 5,000 people. If the allocation is insufficient, the rickshaw committee will handle it directly. At this point, it was already 12 o'clock, so the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Notice to Rickshaw Owners The Special Zone Rickshaw Industry Association issued a notice to all rickshaw owners yesterday, stating that regarding the Mutual Aid Society issue, the association previously received a request from the rickshaw puller representatives in each district to stop paying the Mutual Aid Fee, etc., and reported the situation to the Public Works Department. According to the results of the association's representatives attending the Public Works Department meeting, although the Public Works Department promised to reorganize the Mutual Aid Society, specific plans are still to be discussed. The association believes that the Mutual Aid Fee should continue to be paid, and the opinions of all rickshaw pullers should be solicited separately as a basis. However, the Mutual Aid Fee from May 1st to 6th was originally paid on behalf of the rickshaw owners when they received their licenses in April, so the rickshaw owners are still unable to collect it. A solution will be reached after all rickshaw pullers express their opinions. As for the license fee for May, all rickshaw owners should deposit 5 yuan and 1 jiao per license at the Jiangxi Road Shanghai Bank Trust Department before May 2nd to resolve the issue before donating the license to operate. Regarding the rickshaw puller registration issue, the Public Works Department stated that it will not allow an increase in the number of rickshaw pullers until the exact number of rickshaw pullers is known. The association has printed forms and distributed them to each zhuo hang to conduct a thorough investigation and fill them out, and to test the opinions of all rickshaw pullers on the Mutual Aid Society. The forms should also be filled out and submitted to the association before May 4th for review. This notice is hereby issued for lack of thoroughness.</p>
<p>Bureau Report According to the report of the person in charge of the Public Works Department, the main point of yesterday's negotiations was the future of the rickshaw puller Mutual Aid Society. First, the rickshaw merchants requested a reorganization. The representative of the bureau immediately stated that the current organization of the council of the society was decided at the June meeting last year, which included representatives from rickshaw pullers, rickshaw merchants, municipal merchants associations, Chinese taxpayers associations, rickshaw committee, and social service committee. The organization is quite complete, and the current plan is the result of the rickshaw committee's deep consideration of all issues. However, the Public Works Department is willing to sincerely consider any reorganization plan for the Mutual Aid Society that can guarantee that the revenue will not be shaken, the person in charge of management should be willing to work hard and devote himself to increasing the happiness of members, and can obtain the satisfaction of the Bureau. Before this plan is submitted and passed, the Public Works Department will give priority to rickshaw merchants who are willing to continue cooperating in collecting the Mutual Aid Society fee when issuing licenses. If a rickshaw merchant insists on his own opinion, the Public Works Department may no longer continue his license and the rickshaw committee will decide to issue it. Other rickshaw owners and merchant representatives asked whether the bureau would object if the Mutual Aid Society was separated from the Public Works Department and became independent. The representative of the Public Works Department replied that the bureau does not object to this plan, but this plan should be considered satisfactory by the Public Works Department and be able to guarantee the above two conditions. Then, the two sides discussed the number of rickshaw pullers to be registered. The representative of the Bureau reiterated the previous proposal that it is willing to register a sufficient number of people according to the needs of the rickshaw industry, but the rickshaw merchants should cooperate as a prerequisite, that is, the rickshaw merchants can quickly recommend the 5,000 rickshaw pullers that the rickshaw committee has now decided to register.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Salt Tax Revenue Did Not Decrease in the First Three Months of This Year <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Salt Revenue Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, reports from Nanjing communications stated that the salt tax revenue for January, February, and March of this year had slightly decreased compared to the same period last year. This was said to be due to the widespread sale of refined salt inland and the double impact of smuggling in various regions. Now, according to a spokesperson from the Salt Revenue Audit Office, the tax revenue for January, February, and March of this year has not decreased, but has slightly increased. It is even more unfounded to say that allowing refined salt to be sold inland has reduced tax revenue, as refined and coarse salt are taxed at the same rate, which should not affect the total salt tax revenue.</p>

<p>Wang Rugui, a Shandong native residing in a bungalow behind Fudan University in Jiangwan, has been doing yellow sand and gravel business in Shanghai. He is friendly with Jin Wenkai (a Hunan native), the owner of a pancake shop at No. 55 Luban Road in the South City. When there are family letters to be sent, they are often sent to the pancake shop for Jin to forward. In the middle of this month, a registered mail was sent from Wang's home in Shandong, containing a remittance check for 15 yuan, which was to be received and opened by Wang Rugui. However, after Jin received the registered mail, he secretly opened it. Seeing the 15 yuan remittance check, he had malicious intentions. He secretly did not tell Wang, but went to a seal engraving shop to engrave a chop with the three characters of Wang Rugui, stamped it on the remittance check, and secretly went to the post office to withdraw the 15 yuan for his own use. Later, after Wang investigated and found out the truth, he questioned Jin. Jin's words were evasive, and he refused to hand over the remittance. Wang then reported to the police and took Jin to the Ximen Public Security Branch Bureau. The Third Section of the General Bureau transferred the case to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chen Mingfu, a farmer from Chongming living in Yanjiakou, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on the night of November 21 last year, and his body was abandoned on the riverbank. After Inspector Li Fen of the local court arrived at the scene and determined the cause of death, Chen Huangshi, the wife of the deceased, and Lu Ziliang, the maternal uncle of the deceased, were interrogated on suspicion of jointly committing the murder, and a public prosecution was filed. Cai Dingcheng, the head of the criminal court, repeatedly conducted open trials. Considering that the case involved major discrepancies, he spared no effort in seeking details and repeatedly summoned witnesses for thorough and intensive trials. All circumstances have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the verdict was announced. At that time, Judge Cai arrived at the Criminal Court No. 3, and ordered Chen Huangshi, Lu Ziliang, and others in custody to be brought to the case. Lu Jianai, the defendant's lawyer, also appeared in court at the same time. Judge Cai briefly questioned them a few words, then stood up and announced the verdict: Chen Huangshi and Lu Ziliang were both found not guilty and allowed to be released on bail. However, due to the seriousness of the case, Lu Ziliang must provide three substantial shop guarantees and bear a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan, and Chen Huangshi must provide two substantial shop guarantees and a written guarantee of 5,000 yuan. Attorney Lu Jianai listened to the verdict and stood up, requesting the court to reduce the guarantee and stating that it was not easy to find three shop guarantees at once, and requesting that it be changed to one shop guarantee. Judge Cai instructed that the case was still subject to appeal by the prosecutor and should be handled with caution. He changed Lu Ziliang to two shop guarantees and reduced the guarantee to 8,000 yuan, and Chen Huangshi to two shop guarantees and reduced the guarantee to 4,000 yuan. After the judgment, they were returned to custody separately, pending the completion of the bail procedures before they were allowed to be released on bail.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Prostitute Brothel Owner Sues Xu Qizhong Case Three Promissory Notes Totaling 10,000 Yuan Trial Concluded Yesterday Verdict to be Announced in Five Days <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan, a wealthy merchant from Wuxing living in Shanghai, squandered money and was in debt of tens of thousands. His parents were unwilling to pay the debts on his behalf, so he applied to the First Special District Local Court for bankruptcy. Accountant Wang Sifang was appointed as the bankruptcy administrator, and creditors' meetings were repeatedly called. Most of the creditors believed that Qizhong's debts were all due to wasteful spending, and he hoped to resolve the matter through bankruptcy. Therefore, they jointly filed a criminal self-accusation against Qizhong, requesting that he be punished in accordance with the bankruptcy law. The case has not yet been concluded. Now, Ying Huizhen (also known as Wen Di Lao Si), a prostitute brothel owner, filed a lawsuit against Xu in the First Special Court to confirm the creditor's rights. Huizhen is also one of the creditors. She reported the amount of her claim and submitted three promissory notes written by Xu at the previous creditors' meetings. One was a loan of 1,000 yuan on June 25 last year, one was a loan of 4,000 yuan on July 6, and one was a loan of 5,000 yuan on July 20. However, Xu Qizhong publicly stated that although the total amount of the promissory notes was 10,000 yuan, the actual amount was only 1,000 yuan, which caused all the creditors to express doubts about Huizhen's claim and refused to recognize it. Later, the execution court of the First Special Court summoned the parties for questioning. Although Huizhen still submitted the three promissory notes as evidence, Qizhong also firmly denied it. The judge of the execution court was unable to resolve the matter and ordered that a separate lawsuit be filed to confirm the creditor's rights. Therefore, Ms. Ying hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to formally sue Qizhong. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai summoned them for trial. The defendant was not present. The representative lawyer of the bankruptcy administrator arrived in court and stated that the bankrupt person could not leave his residence during the bankruptcy process without requesting the court's approval. Now, Xu Qizhong has temporarily returned to his hometown to repair the graves, so he did not appear in court today. However, this kind of wealthy young man does not know the difficulties of his father's entrepreneurship, only seeks to squander money, disregards the pros and cons, borrows 1,000 yuan, and signs a 10,000 yuan note. It is possible that this is the truth. In order to protect the interests of other creditors, the case should be adjourned and the defendant summoned to court for further investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the promissory notes and the plaintiff's savings passbook for withdrawing money from the bank, stating that of all the loans, except for the first 1,000 yuan, which was all cash, 1,500 yuan of the second 4,000 yuan was also cash. The remaining 2,500 yuan and the 5,000 yuan of the third loan were withdrawn from the bank, and the evidence is conclusive and verifiable. After reviewing the various evidences, the court adjourned the verdict to the morning of May 5.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a sampan boat without passengers suddenly floated to the surface of the river near the pontoon No. 67 of Puzhong in the South City. A lumberjack spotted it and brought it over. He suddenly found a dead body in the cabin, curled up inside. There was a package of fried soybeans and a wine bottle next to him. The situation was quite strange. The customs water police station was reported, and the sampan was brought back. It was found that the number was 394. It was found that it was driven by Yu Xincai from Ningbo. Yu was summoned to the police station, and he said that his sampan was rented to his cousin Yu Shunxing for driving, and pointed out that the deceased was indeed his cousin's corpse, but the cause of death was unknown. The captain then sent personnel to the dock on East Broadway Road in Hongkou and learned that Tang Shicai of Hua Yi Pengfan Hardware Store had hired him to take him to Datong Wharf and Bailianjing Ping An Shipyard in the South City at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. He left the boat at 5:30 PM, so it was determined that the deceased had died suddenly after drinking alcohol for dinner between 7:00 and 8:00 PM the night before. The port quarantine office was notified and sent a doctor to examine the body. The doctor found that the deceased died of a sudden heart attack due to excessive drinking. The family was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

After the court found out that the accusation was false and Shen Zhixiang was innocent, Chen Anan was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After Wang Ren, the prosecutor, investigated the results, he believed that Chen was indeed guilty of false accusation, so he filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the same court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo repeatedly summoned him for questioning and ordered the debate to be concluded. The verdict was announced yesterday afternoon: Chen Anan was sentenced to six months in prison for false accusation.</p>

<p>Chen Tiaoyuan, the president of the Military Senate, and the late Gao Jing (Zi Zhiqing) of Liaoning were initially friendly as colleagues, and later became in-laws. They each contributed to organize the Yucheng Company, specializing in the sale of coal from the Pole Coal Mine. Gao served as the general manager of Yucheng. Later, because Chen's son was unwilling to marry Gao's eldest daughter, the marriage was canceled. Chen felt very uneasy towards Gao, so he adopted Gao's daughter as his own, and gave her the debt rights and interests obtained from Pole. Last autumn, when Gao was seriously ill, he bequeathed his family property in his will, so that his daughters-in-law Gao Yuxiu Yun, Gao Shengzhenqing, and grandson Gao Zepu, Zehou, etc. would inherit it. The debt rights granted by Chen were naturally included in it. Recently, Chen Yinan, the representative of Yucheng Company, hired a lawyer to sue Gao Yuxiu Yun and others in the First Special District Local Court for occupying 39,000 yuan of Yucheng funds, saying that the funds were repaid by Pole after Yucheng sued him earlier and the court ruled in their favor. Gao Zhiqing included it in his estate, allowing his bereaved family to obtain illegal benefits. However, the defendant filed a defense, saying that the money owed by Dule to Yucheng had already been given to Gao by Chen Tiaoyuan. He also asked to summon Chen to court for questioning. The First Special Court once summoned him, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai opened the court for further trial. Chen Tiaoyuan was not seen. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Yucheng Company was actually opened by Chen alone, and requested that the name of the plaintiff's Yucheng representative, Chen Yinan, be removed, and that Chen Tiaoyuan sue in the name of the company owner. Gao Zhiqing was only the general manager of the company at the beginning. If the defendant handed over the company's capital book, it would be clearer. However, the defendant's lawyer stated that when the company was founded, the 120,000 yuan of capital contributed by Chen was from the military supply office of the 37th Division. At that time, Gao also served in the division, so this money cannot be said to belong to Chen. It is a kind of public money. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the money was paid by the 37th Division on behalf of Chen. After the two lawyers finished their arguments, the court adjourned the sentence to the morning of May 5.</p>

Chief Zhang Yichang immediately dispatched police officers to arrest him. The owner of the den, Zhang Baolin, and two customers, Zhao Jinsheng and Wu Zhushi, were arrested, and a red pill gun, an opium gun, and a lamp, as well as scattered exhibits, were seized. Chief Zhang also found that the floor was movable, and it was indeed a den. Three hundred and twenty red poison pills were found in the garbage and taken to the police station for investigation. After interrogation, it was found that the case involved strictly prohibited drugs, and it was planned to be sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Dong Fulin, who lives in a bungalow in Beiping, Zhongshan Road, West Shanghai, had a daughter named Fuyin, who is now six years old. Recently, she fell ill with fever and chills. The male witch Zhang Aliu, 23 years old, from Shanghai, was invited to his home to watch the incense burner the day before yesterday.

Li returned to her mother's home in Nanjing, but the Lin family refused to let her return. Driven by the need to survive, Li came to Shanghai and became a dancer, quickly gaining fame and being hailed as the "Queen of Dance."</p>
<p>In 1933, Li learned that Lin had returned to China after completing his studies and found him. They lived together at No. 2, Lane 744, Hart Road. However, after living together, Lin neglected his responsibilities and indulged in wandering, gambling, and debauchery. Despite Li's repeated劝告, he turned a deaf ear. Li continued her dancing career to make a living. Lin, however, did not change his ways and secretly pawned Li's jewelry, clothes, etc., dozens of times, amounting to over two thousand yuan. When questioned, he became enraged and subjected her to beatings.</p>
<p>On April 12th of last year, he pawned Li's diamond ring for seventy yuan. When Li confronted him, Lin pushed her violently, causing internal injuries to her right buttock bone. The injury has not yet fully healed, significantly impacting her career. Last autumn, Lin borrowed seven thousand yuan from an Indian named Amu Sen, who sued him in court, leading to Lin's arrest. Subsequently, Lin's girlfriend, a Ms. Zhu, bailed him out. Since then, Lin's whereabouts have been unknown, and the so-called Ms. Zhu, who had been residing in Li's home, also disappeared at the same time. This led to the auction of Li's residence at No. 135, Zhaonong Villa, Zilin South Road, by the local court to clear the debt. All the assets involved were earned by Li through her hard work.</p>
<p>Recently, due to Lin's disappearance and lack of communication, Li feels it is unbearable to continue living together. Therefore, she has engaged lawyer Huang Yiyan to file a suit in the First Special District Court, seeking a divorce from Lin and requesting alimony of two thousand yuan. As Lin's whereabouts are unknown, she requests public notification.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai of the First Special Court opened a civil hearing to summon Li Li. Li and her sister went to the court. The court questioned Li about the facts, and Li provided the above details. Regarding the assault and theft of property, she cited her friend Lin Huifang (resident of No. 14, Zunde Lane, Dongyouheng Road) and her former maid Wang Jinbao (resident of No. 8, Dazhong Lane, Xietu Road) as witnesses. Lawyer Huang Yiyan submitted dozens of pawn tickets and a plaster for her injury to the court as evidence, requesting access to the case file of Lin's debt to Amu Sen (Case No. 611, 1935, Special Court). After verifying the testimonies, Judge Zhang stated that Lin Huifang and Wang Jinbao still needed to be summoned to court for testimony and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Mr. He Yulin and others from the deaf-mute community in Shanghai have initiated the establishment of the China Deaf-Mute Association to promote the well-being of the deaf-mute. They have received support from individuals from various provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Peiping, Tianjin, Shandong, and Sichuan, who share the same condition and have joined the ranks of the initiators. On the first of last month, they held a tea party at the New World Hotel to discuss the implementation plan.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Mr. He Yulin delivered a speech in sign language: "Unfortunately for us, our creators have destroyed our auditory and vocal functions, adding infinite pain and trouble to our complicated and filthy world, stripping away the happiness of life, and subjecting us to social rejection and family contempt. In order to promote the well-being of the deaf-mute community and to ensure the health of the nation and the race, we have joined hands with comrades to organize this unique deaf-mute organization, the "China Deaf-Mute Association," which has long been developed in European and American countries and Japan but has not yet been established in China. We are holding the greatest determination, the greatest courage, and the greatest sacrifice, striving and struggling to create a self-reliant movement and fight for the bright future of our happiness."</p>
<p>From Mr. He Yulin's speech, it is evident that the deaf-mute community not only does not abandon themselves to despair but also shares the responsibility of the nation, which is commendable.

<p>Chen Yingjun, the former manager of the Lafayette Dance Hall, resident of No. 10, Rongfuli, Xujia Lane, Ganse Dong Road, has recently been sued in the Second Special Court by shareholders Feng Houcai and Jin Fenggang (resident of No. 315, Kulun Road, Zhabei) through their lawyer Lin Yingqing, requesting Chen to return the remaining partnership assets.</p>
<p>According to the court records, the plaintiffs' lawyer stated that the defendant had solicited the plaintiffs to invest in the Lafayette Dance Hall on May 1, 1934, each investing 1,800 yuan per share. Unexpectedly, after May 20, 1935, they received a notice from the defendant that the business was closing. An audit revealed that the Lafayette Dance Hall had incurred a loss of 26,953.29 yuan. Deducting this from the total capital of 41,400 yuan leaves a surplus partnership asset of 14,446.71 yuan. Dividing this by the total number of 23 shares, each share should receive 628.11 yuan. Therefore, the defendant should reimburse the plaintiffs a total of 1,256.22 yuan. Despite repeated demands, the defendant has ignored them, leading to this lawsuit, requesting that the court order the defendant to return the full amount and allow for provisional execution.</p>
<p>In response, the defendant Chen Yingjun stated that he had not yet returned the money because the accounts receivable had not been collected. Judge Ma Yishu concluded the debate and set a date for the verdict on May 29th.</p>

These individuals confessed that their accomplices were hiding in the Xiafei Apartment on Xiafei Road in the Shanghai French Concession. Consequently, Yang Fengqi and Xu Pengfei, the chief inspectors of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, reported this to the French Concession police, who cooperated in apprehending Wang Dongyu, who had falsely claimed to be the commander of the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Column, as well as his secretary Yu Hou, and military supplies officer Zhang XueLi. A large number of appointment letters and insignia were confiscated. They were handed over to the Second Special Court. The police prosecuted them for disturbing public order, among other charges. The court ruled that the case was inadmissible. The police, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After review, the case was remanded to the Second Special Court for retrial. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu conducted successive interrogations and concluded the debate. Yesterday afternoon, the verdict was announced: Wang Dongyu was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for forging official documents sufficient to cause harm to others. Yu Hou and Zhang Xueli were found not guilty. Yu and Zhang were released on bail of 1,000 yuan, provided by a foreign firm, pending the appeal period.</p>

<p>Yu Shangxun, the principal of the Minhua Elementary School (now renamed Chunjiang) at No. 10 Shangwen Lane, Weihaiwei Road, previously reported to the Chengdu Road police that Ding Jiasheng (also known as Ding Hao), a teacher at the school, had stolen several suits of his clothing. The police dispatched detectives who apprehended Ding and discovered multiple pawn tickets in Ding's trunk, some of which corresponded to the items Yu had reported as stolen. Ding was prosecuted in the First Special Court. Ding claimed that the female teacher, Shen Shuqing, had a prior relationship with him but was now being pursued by Yu, and had deliberately placed the pawn tickets in his trunk to frame him. At the time, both Shen and Yu denied any such relationship. Consequently, Ding was sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended for two years. An appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court was also rejected. Shortly after, Shen sued Yu for obscenity, which was subsequently settled and the charges withdrawn. Recently, Ding obtained a letter from Shen Shuqing to Wang Zuzhen, another female teacher at Minhua Elementary School, in which Shen stated that Ding's case was in fact a false accusation orchestrated by Yu and that she intended to confess to the court. After obtaining this letter, Ding believed that the injustice he had suffered could be rectified. He hired lawyer Sun Shi'an and filed a petition for retrial with the Second Branch of the High Court. The Second Branch of the High Court granted the retrial. Judge Nie Chongyi opened the investigation yesterday. Shen Shuqing was summoned and admitted that Yu's accusations against Ding were untrue. Judge Nie announced an adjournment, ordered Shen Shuqing to be available for questioning at any time, and directed her to confess to the Procuratorate of the First Special Court. Shen was subsequently released on bail by lawyer Chen Xingmin.</p>

<p>In the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, the Governor of Jiangsu, Lu Chunjiang, recognizing the unreliability of recruitment, petitioned to implement conscription. He assigned new military officers and school officials to various counties of the Su, Song, and Tai prefectures to establish conscription bureaus and instructed local officials to formulate preferential treatment measures for conscripted soldiers to encourage enlistment. Consequently, scholars, gentry, and children of prominent families responded enthusiastically, totaling over 1,500 individuals. When these soldiers departed, all schools prepared colorful flags and celebrated their departure according to the ritual for new entrants. They were organized into three battalions stationed near Shangjin Bridge. The following year, a military academy was established. From these soldiers, one hundred were selected to study in the academy. After two years of graduation, they were assigned as officers in the 45th and 46th Schools. During the Xinhai Revolution, they were led by Governor Cheng to attack Nanjing and performed commendably. Thirty years have passed since then. Half of them have died in battle or from illness, while the survivors are scattered across various provinces and cities, having transitioned to other professions. Now, Sun Chucheng, Yu Baoying, Gao Wosheng, and others have initiated a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of their military service. They have scheduled it for the 3rd of this month at Tiger Hill in Suzhou. The day before, a preparatory meeting will be held at No. 51 Banlian Lane in the city to finalize the program for the general assembly. The preparation office for the gathering meal is located at No. 30 Jiyi Lane, Wujin Road, Shanghai. In recent days, individuals from Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces have reported their attendance. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Qiu Yuelian's Concubine Suicide Case Dismissed; Victim's Family Unwilling to Pursue the Matter <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Yuelian, an actress in a Shaoxing opera troupe at the Sincere Company rooftop garden, cohabited with her concubine, Qiu Ye, at No. 120 Baike Road. On April 27th, at approximately 1:00 AM, Qiu attempted to persuade Ye to quit gambling, leading to a quarrel that escalated into physical violence. After being beaten, Ye, out of anger and without informing anyone, secretly ingested opium to commit suicide. By the time Qiu discovered it and sent her to the hospital, it was too late. Ye died from poisoning. The body was sent to the coroner's office, where it was determined that Qiu Ye had indeed died from poisoning. Qiu Yuelian was arrested and sent to the First Special Court. The police prosecuted her under Article 278, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for causing serious injury. Judge Liu Yugui had already interrogated her once and ordered her detained for a subsequent hearing. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu resumed the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. However, according to the forensic report, it was determined that the deceased had died from opium poisoning, with minor injuries to her hands and face. According to Article 277 of the Criminal Code, minor injury offenses require a formal complaint to be filed. Therefore, the deceased's mother, Ye Xia, was questioned. She stated that her daughter had married a Mr. Wu at the age of eighteen. Her son-in-law had died last June, and her daughter had been residing with her husband's family. She was unaware of her daughter's relationship with the defendant until after her death, when she was notified and went to the coroner's office to claim the body. Now that her daughter is dead and she is elderly, she does not wish to pursue the matter further. The deceased's aunt, Wu Xu, stated that she was 67 years old, a local resident living in Chong'an Lane, Haifang Road. The deceased was her daughter-in-law. After her son passed away last June 14th, her daughter-in-law claimed to be working in a yarn factory and had moved out. She had been sending her a few yuan each month. Therefore, she was unaware of her daughter-in-law's cohabitation with the defendant. Now that her daughter-in-law is dead, she also does not wish to pursue the matter deeply against the defendant, but requests that the defendant provide a certain amount of money each month for her two grandchildren's expenses. Qiu Yuelian was questioned and retained Zhou Yongding as her lawyer to represent her. Judge Liu, considering that the victim's family did not wish to pursue the case, announced in court that the case was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Robbery and Assault: Lu Guisheng Sentenced to 14 Years <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Lu Guisheng, a native of Pudong, gambled and recently became unemployed, unable to make a living. His cousin, Zhang Xigen, also from his hometown, lived at No. 10 Baoxing Lane, Wuzhou Road, and ran a thriving beef stall in the same road's market. His wife, Qiao, kept gold lockets and gold chains worth 300 yuan in a drawer in their bedroom. Lu, aware of these items, harbored malicious intent. At 4:30 AM on the morning of the 15th of this month, taking advantage of Zhang Xigen's absence at the stall, Lu carried a sharp knife and a rope. From the sun deck of his neighbor Gong Chuntao, also from Pudong, he used the rope to descend into his cousin Zhang Qiao's room and stole the gold locket and chain. Qiao noticed and quickly arose, holding him back and calling out his name. Lu, in a panic, pulled out the sharp knife and stabbed her five times in the head, back, and left arm. Qiao, in extreme pain, fell to the ground and cried for help. Lu immediately fled through the door. After the incident, detectives Shao Jingfan and Ye Yusi, and officer Cao Jinbiao of the Jiaxing Road police station arrested him. Lu claimed that Zhang Xigen, the owner of the beef stall, and Gong Chuntao were the instigators and that the stolen goods were stored at Gong's residence. The detectives subsequently apprehended Gong. A sharp knife and rope, discarded by Zhang Xigen, were found in his home and brought to the police station. Zhang Qiao was transported by ambulance to the Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital on Bazilu for treatment. Lu and Gong were sent to the First Special Court. After investigation, the police determined that Gong Chuntao had been falsely accused by Lu. Lu was charged with robbery, attempted murder, and false accusation. It was ordered that Lu be remanded in custody, while Gong was released on bail. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi resumed the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Attorney Li Zhishan from the Municipal Council stated that the victim, Zhang Qiao, was still recovering from her injuries in the hospital and could not attend the court. The maid Jiang Aida testified and presented the doctor's medical certificate for inspection, requesting severe punishment. According to Jiang Aida's testimony, at the time of the stabbing, the master of the house fell to the ground and cried out Lu Guisheng's name. She heard the commotion, went to investigate, and saw him fleeing from the stairs. Questioned about this, Lu's confession was evasive. Judge Jiang sentenced Lu Guisheng to eight years imprisonment for robbery, ten years for attempted murder, to be served concurrently for a total of fourteen years. The remaining charges were found not guilty. The knife and rope were confiscated. Gong Chuntao was released.</p>

<p>Respected Editor: I have seen the news in your newspaper today (April 30th) about Sun Yin abusing and causing the death of his maid, Donglan, etc., which are all inconsistent with the facts. Ms. Sun was lonely in her family, so she adopted Donglan as her adopted daughter two years ago to accompany her. When she was adopted, the child was only five years old, so how could she be a maid? And there is evidence to check at the Household Registration Office of the Gaoqiao Public Security Branch, so the accusation that she priced and bought a maid is actually in violation of Article 296, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, etc., and is actually a false accusation. That decision to be pressed for a case of injury causing death is also untrue, and the court has already investigated and issued a non-prosecution decision. The matter concerns Ms. Sun's reputation, so she is specially sending a letter to clarify the facts, and requesting that you make a correction immediately. I am extremely grateful. With deepest respect to the Editor, Sun Yin, No. 43 Shagang, Gaoqiao District, Shanghai, April 30th.</p>

<p>After listening to instructions and performing in Beijing yesterday, our country's World Games soccer delegation took the Beijing-Shanghai night train last night and returned to Shanghai at 7:00 AM today. In response to the invitation of the French Business School, they will compete against the French Business School at Yiyuan at 3:30 PM this afternoon. The referee is Zhu Qiu, the linesmen are He Chunhui and Lv Yaofu. The French Business School is the champion of the current Western League, and its lineup is as complete as the Western League, and most of the main committee members are also those who attended the Western League a few days ago. Therefore, today's battle will inevitably be very tense, and our country's players went to Beijing the night before, and returned to Shanghai last night, rushing here in weariness and lack of sleep, and will inevitably feel extremely tired mentally. Therefore, the outcome of this battle is unpredictable.</p>
<p>In order to avoid congestion, today's game will be held at Yiyuan, so that management can be thorough and order can be easily maintained. Tickets are still divided into two types, one yuan and half a yuan. The long-term gift tickets of the Sports Association and the Western League will not be valid.

<p>The Chinese Sports Federation men's basketball games yesterday held three matches. In the first match, Fudan faced Daxia. Both sides were evenly matched.

The final result was 46 to 19, with Shanghai College defeating Fushi by a wide margin. In the third match, Guanghua faced Minli.

In the second half, Minli was determined to fight to the death and resisted fiercely, leveling the score with 18 to 14. However, because of too many points lost in the first half, they ultimately failed. The final result was 33 to 12, with Guanghua triumphing. This afternoon at 2 o'clock, Shanghai College will play Fudan in a make-up game. Both teams have won all five of their games in this tournament. This game will decide the championship.

<h3 id="e166">Jiangnan University Football: Fudan vs. Guanghua Game Not Played Yesterday; Guanghua Absent at the Last Minute <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The final match of the Jiangnan University Football League, Fudan versus Guanghua, has been repeatedly delayed. It was originally scheduled to take place at 3 p.m. yesterday at Fudan, but Guanghua failed to arrive at the last minute, and the game was not held. According to a member of the Jiangnan University Football Committee, it is proposed that Jinan University and Guanghua share the championship equally as a solution. However, this proposal must be agreed upon by Fudan and considered by the Jiangnan University Football Committee before a final decision is made. According to the rules of this year's Jiangnan University Football League, only Jinan University, Fudan, and Guanghua participated. In the first match, Jinan University tied with Guanghua. In the second match, Fudan lost to Jinan University. Based on past results, Jinan University has a total of three points, Guanghua one point, and Fudan zero points. If the championship is shared equally by Jinan University and Guanghua, then the final match will be considered a forfeit by Fudan, it is said.</p>

<p>Unprecedented Spectacle in the Capital; Over Ten Thousand People Attend; World Games Football Team Performs; Chairman Lin Sends Lu Chao as Representative to Give Instructions; Ministers and Officials from Various Departments Attend to Watch the Game</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Nanjing, 30th) The World Games football team, led by Shen Gangliang, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. The Lixing Society hired cars to welcome them at the station and take them to the Society for breakfast. At noon, they went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects and lay a wreath. After the ceremony, the teams visited scenic spots such as Tan's Tomb. At noon, they attended a public banquet hosted by the Capital Party, Government, Military, Academic, and Sports Association and the Lixing Society. At 4 p.m., they were trained at the Lixing Stadium. Chairman Lin felt slightly unwell and sent Staff Officer Lu Chao as his representative to give instructions, stating that China's decision to participate in the World Games with more than 80 people was to showcase the spirit of the Chinese nation and Chinese culture to the people of the world, and wished them victory and health. After the speech, Huang Renlin introduced the "King of Football" Li Huitang to the audience, who applauded thunderously, expressing their enthusiastic welcome. It was decided that Dean Dai would kick off the exhibition match under the refereeing of Zhang Xinfu. Because the two teams, A and B, were essentially the same, there was no real competition, so the audience and the players were not particularly tense. Twenty minutes after the kickoff, Jing Guicheng of Team A scored the first goal. Li Huitang felt that his strength was not as good as before because of a recent illness, so he shot less. After resting and taking photos, the competition was fiercer in the second half. Li Tiansheng of Team A was penalized for a penalty kick. Hua Bei Hua of Team B scored a goal. Afterwards, Yang Shuiyi and Xu Wenkui of Team B each scored. Finally, Li Huitang shot on goal, accurately and powerfully, but it was blocked by Zhang Rongcai. Chen Zhenhe then headed the ball into the net, making the score 2 to 3. By the time the game was over, it was already 6 p.m. More than ten thousand people attended, making it an unprecedented spectacle for a football match in the capital. Many ministers and officials from various departments of the central government also attended to watch the game. In the evening, Dai Jitao and others hosted a banquet for the team at the Lixing Society. The entire team returned to Shanghai by night train at 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Exhibition Match Details (Dispatch from Nanjing, 30th) The World Games football team arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th and rested at the Lixing Society before going to pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. At 4 p.m., they played an exhibition match at the Lixing Stadium, divided into Team A and Team B. It was originally scheduled for Chairman Lin to give instructions before the start of the match, but Chairman Lin was slightly unwell, so Lu Chao gave the instructions on his behalf, with many words of encouragement. After Dean Dai kicked off the match, the two teams immediately made contact. Team B had a strong offensive, and the ball often revolved in Team A's area. Fortunately, the defense was effective and there were no losses. After half an hour of melee, Cao Guicheng, assisted by Feng Jingxiang, sprinted along the sideline and shot fiercely from more than ten yards to the right of the goal. Zhang Rongcai was unable to save it, and Team A scored first. Afterwards, neither side made any further gains, and Team A led 1-0 in the first half. After the break, Team B was even more active. After ten minutes, Li Tiansheng touched the ball with his hand in the goal area and was penalized for a penalty kick. Yang Shuiyi shot it into the corner of the net, tying the score at 1-1. Five minutes later, Xu Wenkui, assisted by Li Guowei, scored again. At this time, Team A's defense was in chaos. Jia Youliang crossed from the baseline and was headed into the net by Xu, making it 3-1. Team B's momentum was great. Although Team A tried to counterattack, their coordination was scattered and ineffective. Until a quarter of an hour before the end of the match, Zhuo Shijin, assisted by Jiu Guicheng, scored a goal. After that, it was still Team B's game. Jia Youliang and Xu Wenkui both broke through Team A's last line of defense, but because it was an exhibition match, they let it go lightly. Otherwise, Team A would have been defeated 5-2. When the whistle blew, Team B finally triumphed 3-2. Overall, the exhibition match was not exciting and disappointing. Apart from Feng Jingxiang and Chen Zhenhe, who were slightly pleasing, the rest of Team A were mediocre and unremarkable. On Team B, only Ouyang Kang of Nanjing had slightly inferior skills. The rest of the players were impressive, especially Jiang Shanjing, who was aggressive both on offense and defense and was praised by the entire audience. After the performance of the two teams, they took a car back to Shanghai that night. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Only one way to eliminate toxins, break addiction, recover from weakness, and strengthen the body</p>
<p>There are eight methods to quit smoking: sleeping pills, blistering, serum, antitoxin, substitution, bloodletting, alteration, and tonics.</p>
<p>However, the psychology of those who quit smoking is to seek mental pleasure and eliminate weakness and illness. They cannot tolerate hospitalization, continue to work as usual, fear surgery, quit secretly, shorten the quitting period, and save money while achieving significant results. Therefore, tonic quitting methods are the most popular. However, there are thousands of tonic remedies. To achieve the effects of eliminating toxins, breaking addiction, recovering from weakness, and strengthening the body, reproductive gland preparations are the most effective.</p>

<p>(Physician Yu Bofu's Report) Last autumn, Mr. Bao Guangfu was introduced to me by Mr. Li Baolie for treatment. He complained that he had seminal emission and stomach pain during the quitting period, making it difficult to complete the process. After examining Mr. Bao, I found that his condition was no different from Mr. Li's, and the source of the illness was the same. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Remedy" and "Stomach Tonic" from Taihe Pharmacy to treat his stomach problems at the root. He was instructed to take "Himitto's Semen-Stabilizing Tablets" to strengthen his spermatic valve and "Reproductive Essence" to replenish his deficiencies, eliminate toxins, and break the addiction. In just about four weeks, he was able to achieve the same satisfactory results.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Among women's hidden illnesses, leukorrhea is the most common. Long-term infertility is often caused by it. Leukorrhea is caused by inflammation of the uterus and vagina, which results in a purulent discharge. When sperm encounter it, they are completely destroyed, making it difficult to conceive.</p>
<p>There are various treatments for this condition. The commonly used methods include systemic therapy, local irrigation therapy, vulvar drying therapy, and biological therapy. However, the most effective is a preparation made from lactic acid bacteria, vaginal bacilli, and liver starch. Because its effects combine the strengths of many methods, it can be secretly self-treated at home, making it suitable for women's current environment.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Radical Cure for Leukorrhea with Internal and External Use <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>(Physician Ren Guoxiang's Report) Mrs. Moude had suffered from chronic leukorrhea for years. Last year, she was introduced to me by her close relative. She complained of lower back and back pain, irregular menstruation, and long-term infertility. I prescribed a formula and instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Essence" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Remedy" for external use from Wuzhou Pharmacy. Within a month, her menstruation was regulated, her discharge was clear, and her lower back and back were strong. She happily thanked me and left. In early autumn, her close relative introduced Mrs. Chen Zhongheng to me for treatment of the same condition, saying that she had learned that Mrs. Moude was pregnant.</p>

<p>(From Mr. Shen Mianru in person) I was born with a weak constitution, resulting in a lack of proper development during my developmental years. I lost my vigor, and illnesses arose one after another. (Omitted section) In recent years, due to excessive burdens and overexertion, I suffered from symptoms such as lower back pain, heart palpitations, night sweats, cold limbs, body tremors, insomnia, forgetfulness, a sallow complexion, emaciation, and premature aging. Last autumn, I wrote to your publication and was advised that "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) was a suitable remedy for my condition. I immediately purchased it from the Sino-French Pharmacy, specifying the brand. After taking it internally according to the instructions, my spirit was strengthened, my blood was enriched, my body became robust, and my waist became healthy. The ailments I suffered from gradually disappeared. After taking it for about a month, I regained the youthful vigor that I should have had in my earlier years.</p>

<p>(Report from Physician Jia Zhizhong) The patient, Du Xingcha, previously suffered from a severe venereal disease. Although cured, the residual toxins persisted, causing him constant joint pain. This condition lingered for many years. Last autumn, he complained of numbness and insensitivity in his hands and feet. I instructed him to purchase and take "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Huamei Pharmacy to eliminate the residual toxins and treat his pain. After taking several boxes, his joints felt noticeably lighter, and his hands and feet became more agile. Within about a month, he achieved a complete recovery. He happily expressed his gratitude and departed.</p>

<p>(From Mr. Pu Lianghua in a letter) I engaged in masturbation early in life, leading to seminal emission. After marriage, I also suffered from kidney weakness, and my vitality disappeared. I had no happiness and was physically frail. I often had thoughts of despair. I took various medications without any effect, and numerous complications arose, causing me great suffering. Last autumn, I was fortunate to be introduced by a colleague to Physician Zhan Nianceng for treatment. I received electric therapy and was instructed to purchase and take "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) and "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking them for about half a dozen courses, my ailments were completely cured. Now I am strong and healthy, my essence is abundant, and my spirit is vigorous. My vitality has been rekindled, and my happiness is boundless. This is due to the miraculous skills of the renowned doctor and the revitalizing effects of the famous medicine.</p>

<p>(Report from Physician Wang Shiying) The patient, Pan Zuoting, is currently 43 years old. In his youth, he accidentally ate spoiled food, leading to severe stomach problems. He suffered from frequent bouts of pain, and found no comfort whether sitting or lying down. Medication was difficult to cure. Last autumn, he came to me for treatment. I carefully prepared the famous medicine "Wei Tong Ling" (Stomach Pain Remedy) and administered it. "Jian Wei Su" (Stomach-Strengthening Element) was believed to strengthen the diseased stomach and promote rapid recovery. Using both medicines together could cure the stomach ailment. I instructed him to purchase them from the Sino-Western Pharmacy. After taking them, the effects were remarkable. He continued to take them for about a month, achieving a full and satisfactory recovery.</p>

<p>"Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" are the main treatment!</p>
<p>Patient: Ma Pengling, 42 years old, from Jiujiang, a businessman. (Chief complaint): Joint pain. (Medical history): Mr. Ma contracted gonorrhea due to a dalliance. He delayed treatment, which became chronic. It seemed to heal but then recurred. The toxins entered his bones, causing joint pain. He took various rheumatism and bone pain medications, but they were ineffective because they did not address the source of the toxins. Last autumn, he was introduced to me by Mr. Ye Rongbo, whom I had previously circumcised. (Treatment): I diagnosed Mr. Ma with chronic gonorrhea that had persisted for many years and was resistant to over-the-counter medications. I used electric therapy to cure him. For the bone pain, I instructed him to purchase and take "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Yong'an Company. After taking them, the toxins were eliminated, the inflammation subsided, and his joints felt much more comfortable than before.</p>

Later, her menstruation became irregular, sometimes early and sometimes late, with either excessive or scant flow. Since last year, she has experienced even more abdominal pain during menstruation and increased leukorrhea. Last year, she was introduced to me by Mrs. Wang Xietang. (Treatment): I determined that Mrs. Li also suffered from severe uterine inflammation, which could only be treated with female gonadal preparations. I instructed her to purchase and take "Women's Reproductive Element" from the Huamei Pharmacy to warm the uterus, eliminate inflammation, regulate menstruation, and treat leukorrhea. To expedite her recovery, she also used "Liao Dai Ling" (Leukorrhea Remedy) externally. Within about a month, all her ailments disappeared.

(Medical history): Mr. Chen was influenced by obscene books and engaged in excessive masturbation. This self-inflicted harm severely depleted his essence. Later, he became aware of his brain weakness and emaciation and finally abstained. However, he already suffered from nocturnal emission and wet dreams, which he neglected to treat. He also experienced spermatorrhea during the day. As the condition worsened, he even leaked semen at the sight of women.

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a drop in pure gold prices and a continued decline in the opening market. However, there were special buyers in the market taking advantage of the low prices, with significant external support. Concerns about cash withdrawals fueled rumors, leading to initial instability but eventual stabilization. In the morning, overseas silver markets reported declines in London and stability in the US. Traders indicated that there was minor buying from India after the market closed but also cited large sellers listed on the exchange. Forward silver prices in Montreux rose by 1.5 to 3.7 points. Exchange rates rose slightly. London spot gold prices declined by one penny. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates showed no change for both the UK and the US. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The reserve requirement was posted at 11.409 yuan, a decline of 1 cent. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened lower at 40.5 yuan. Huixiang, Tongtaichang entered the market to buy at the lower prices, pushing it up to 1 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongfuxing, Yongda, and Decheng sold off to stabilize the market. The morning opened slightly lower, and the market weakened slightly due to selling by banks. Unexpectedly, large investors took advantage of the lower prices to purchase gold bars, bringing external support to the gold market. Concerns about cash withdrawals boosted buying interest, gradually pushing prices back up. HSBC's posted exchange rates showed no change for both the UK and the US. The market stabilized. The silver balance tax was reduced by 0.25. Afterwards, there was a slight drop. Later, rumors that the cash reserve would be reduced from 60% to 40% prompted large investors to buy, causing prices to rise. However, many took profits at the higher prices, and buying interest waned as prices rose. The market trend turned flat at noon. In the afternoon market, transactions were ordinary, with alternating rises and falls. The trend gradually became uncertain. Later, with continued selling and a decline in Indian silver prices, the market remained weak. However, large investors continued to buy at the lower prices, and the final trend was stable. The swap premium rose again to 4.4 yuan, due to the impending clearance of public debt today. A record of the day's market conditions follows:</p>

<h3 id="e197">Four-Quarter Long-Term Loans Conclude; Coping Remains Difficult; Disputes Not Yet Resolved <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The circumstances surrounding this year's long-term settlement have been detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. The overview as of yesterday appeared outwardly uneventful. However, a close analysis of the underlying tensions reveals the following points: Historically, Ningbo banks have extended long-term loans in Shanghai through Shanghai money shops. Therefore, repayments must also be secured by these shops. Unfortunately, this year's debtors are not merely ignoring their obligations; they genuinely lack the means to repay. Many are requesting to pay only the interest without repaying the principal. The Ningbo banks, having suffered significant setbacks in Ningbo last year, feel unable to extend loans for extended periods. Thus, they are pressing the Shanghai money shops to demand repayment, but the Shanghai shops lack the resources to cover these debts. This has resulted in a deadlock (a term in the trade for "forced execution"), causing dissatisfaction on both sides. As matters stand, forceful collection is futile. Disputes of this nature were visible everywhere yesterday. In the Shanghai financial community, a notice was issued by the Chamber of Commerce last autumn when the ten-quarter long-term loans matured, allowing a uniform extension for repayment by the four-quarter deadline next year (i.e., this year). Upon the arrival of this year's deadline, the debtors remained unable to repay. However, the financial community, having endured this extension, is now finding it extremely difficult to manage. Should further extensions be granted this year, it will be difficult to meet other obligations. Therefore, more stringent measures are necessary. These disputes will likely persist for some time. The tension within the banking and money shop industries is evident. This year, the extension of new long-term accounts is limited to those with significant latent potential. Some lenders initially agreed to extend credit but ultimately failed to honor their commitments due to environmental factors. A number of businesses have been forced to suspend operations or close down as a result. The majority of secured loans maturing this year cannot be finalized. Those able to repay both the principal and interest are considered exceptional. In most cases, borrowers cannot afford to repay either. If creditors were to dispose of the collateral through auction, they would incur significant losses. Even if tangible collateral exists, selling at low prices would result in substantial losses for the creditors. Unwilling to shoulder these losses, major negotiations are expected. In general, the conclusion of this year's long-term loans will likely be followed by a series of debt disputes. As for the long-term loans maturing yesterday, in addition to deposit portions, the money shops fulfilled their repayment obligations as usual. However, all outstanding long-term loans were generally rolled over, either transferred to current accounts or exchanged for new IOUs. Final settlements were exceedingly rare.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Securities: Bullish Momentum Sustained for Public Bonds; Demand Temporarily Exceeds Supply; Resulting in More Rises Than Declines <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Hua Merchants Securities Exchange, the bullish momentum continued, and its strength should not be underestimated. Trading desks largely follow the lead of major investors. Therefore, their buying interest typically arises from the purchases of Nos. 4 and 11, triggering widespread absorption. Any slight pullback is met with a push higher. Bears rely on fluctuations in the political situation. However, the subdued environment and ongoing negotiations for extended legal tender usage and Mr. Chen Guangfu's successful negotiations in the United States are all bolstering the bulls. Bears, repeatedly threatened, are covering shorts and turning positive at lower levels, given the upward trend. The overall future of public bonds is difficult to predict with optimism. Yesterday, the market opened firm across the board. While Nos. 10, 37, and 47 were selling, the purchases of Nos. 4, 11, 22, and 35 caused demand to exceed supply. Only forward Class A bonds fell slightly by 0.015 yuan, while the rest rose uniformly by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. During the final settlement, selling pressure surged due to the weakness of forward Class A bonds. Nos. 10 and 48 were both selling, and market prices suddenly declined by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. Market prices fluctuated, and investor sentiment was difficult to unify. The afternoon opening was initially weak, declining slightly by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. Ultimately, No. 4 made strenuous efforts to push the prices higher, and subsequent issues also turned firm. This month's Class A bond rose the most by 0.35 yuan. Although trading volume decreased slightly at the close, the trend remained firm. While No. 5 was selling heavily, No. 4 absorbed the selling effectively. Except for this month's Class B bond, which declined slightly by 0.1 yuan, the rest rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The total trading volume was 5,325,000 yuan. A comparative list of the resulting increases and decreases is provided below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but declined in the afternoon, remaining dull and uninspired. This is because most market participants are bearish, and warehouses are congested with yarn. This cotton yarn lacks the momentum to drive prices higher. Sellers are extremely active, and selling increases with rising prices. The future depends on actual demand.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Market Sees Sudden Surge in Selling Pressure in the Afternoon; Marked Yarn Market Opens Lower in the Morning;</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened lower this month by 0.4 yuan. Prices for distant months remained unchanged. Due to renewed absorption by the bulls, the market became tight after the second round, with rising cotton prices and bullish sentiment. Prices rose by 0.7 to 1 yuan across all months. During the third closing, some shorts added to their positions, causing a slight pullback. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.3 to 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw stable market conditions, with prices varying across different months. After the second round, the market felt empty, and selling pressure surged, causing prices to decline steadily, indicating a lack of confidence. As a result, prices for all months declined by 0.8 to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,100 bales of Hengyi, 1,100 bales of Juyu, 400 bales of Shenchang, 600 bales of Renfeng, 50 bales of Wu Yi Wu Shou, 750 bales of Taichang, 550 bales of Yongchang, 1,300 bales of Tonghe, and 500 bales of Gengfeng.

<p>Cotton market initially rose and then fell, with fierce competition between bulls and bears, resulting in rapid market fluctuations. In the morning, bulls heavily purchased, and local cotton merchants also actively increased their bids, with both buyers and sellers advancing together. However, the future remains turbulent, amidst raging waves.</p>
<p>Yuan Xingchang and Changfeng Aggressively Dumped Spot Cotton: The opening prices for all months were high in the morning, displaying strong momentum. However, due to the drop in US cotton prices (2 to 9 points), Indian cotton prices were stronger, at 1.25 to 2.5 rupees. Osaka's No. 3 cotton was suspended due to the Tianchang Festival, further boosting market sentiment. Mingde Youhe heavily purchased, for a substantial amount, which drained the market. As a result, all months rose by 0.3 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was mediocre, but weakened significantly later. Selling pressure was extremely strong, and rumors spread that a certain bull company, fearing losses on its previously acquired 30,000 dan, would sell at the market price. Consequently, sellers rushed to unload their holdings. Yuan Xingchang and Changfeng aggressively dumped, causing prices to decline further. As a result, all months fell by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Yuan Xingchang sold 8,100 dan, Changfeng 6,400 dan, Xincheng 3,000 dan, Renfeng 1,700 dan, Yongchang 1,400 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Changyu 1,700 dan, Juxing 3,400 dan, Hengyi 2,500 dan, Yuda 2,100 dan, and Daji 1,400 dan.

<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a meeting on April 28 to discuss the grading of spot yarn for the October 25th futures contract.

<p>US Cotton Market Weak: British Cotton Unchanged, Indian Cotton Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened slightly down across all months by one point. Bull positions in the May contract were closed out in the morning, with balanced hedging. Brokers, encouraged by favorable weekly weather reports, engaged in selling. The falling stock market also contributed to the weak prices. However, selling pressure was not severe. No liquidation of stored cotton was observed in the May contract. Later, some shorts covered their positions, leading to a slight recovery. According to some speculators, the small decline in the stock market may not be enough to prevent the sale of cotton pledged as collateral. The market needs calm. Cloth activity was stable, with spot cotton down 9 points and futures down 2 to 5 points. British cotton spot and futures were unchanged. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering and speculator buying, but later retraced slightly due to cotton merchant hedging. According to the telegram, Pingle rose by 2.25 to 2.5 rupees, while Omla and Bai Luo Xi both rose by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees. (Telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the forecast opening price for Bai Luo Xi cotton for the July/August contract on the 30th was 200 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the last day for the delivery of April futures. Tianjin, this street, and other firms made deliveries. Some small short sellers covered their positions. Factories remained firm. Large bull traders, realizing that the market price was too loose, negotiated with each other to raise prices in order to adjust their positions. The market sentiment stabilized slightly. Small quantities of fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, coarse cloth, and 8.4-pound grey cloth were absorbed by this street, so the market was not quiet. However, actual sales declined sharply, and all channels were quiet, with no activity. The market may still find it difficult to maintain its support.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Dark-Colored Woolens Are Out of Season <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wholesale and retail trading of woolens was very active, especially in Beijing and Shanghai, where sales were the strongest. The southern five provinces and the Sichuan guild also saw activity. There was significant daily demand for various types of Western suits. However, dark black woolens, including straight tribute, Walter tweed, suit materials, and common Chinese clothing materials, all experienced sluggish sales. Buyers' demand weakened, likely due to the warmer weather, with buyers focusing on lighter colors.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Yuanfang Piece Goods White Goods See Inferior Results <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>

Yuan velvet rose slightly, and Yuanfu silk saw some downstream sales. Yuan feather silk rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, but the "Eighteen Sons" and "Jiefu" brands remained stable. Yangjiang cloth's heavy weight quoted price stood out. Blue and white Western yarn poplin were slightly inferior. Bleached fine cloth was in season, but due to the cold weather and lack of guest transactions, the upward trend was latent.</p>

<p>The trading of miscellaneous grains was quite active. 87 railcars of standard soybeans were traded, with oil factories on both sides. Hand overer majority were Hankou-based, with the rest being scattered customers from various regions. In terms of trends, because very few Dalian beans were arriving and prices were difficult to negotiate, oil factories had to rely on domestic sources for raw materials, leading to rising prices in the market. This was the main reason. Soybean oil also traded 2,500 dan, with factories handing it over and this street and customers receiving it. A considerable amount of foreign standard sesame was also traded, totaling 24 tickets, with the majority of the sellers being foreign firms and the rest being local hoarders.</p>
<p>Flour trading was very quiet. Due to limited stock, factories had little inventory. Only Fuxin Third Factory (Bingchuan Branch) traded 4,000 bags, with no other transactions. There was also no standard wheat trading, as prior transactions were already low.</p>
<p>US wheat production estimates are expected to be higher than last year. Frequent rainfall is predicted to continue. The factory market is weak, and sentiment is mixed between bullish and bearish.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than 30 sources from various regions arrived, totaling over 7,000 piculs of goods. Local sales were inferior to before. Tianjin and Qingdao bought only over 1,000 packages, so the market was weak. Although the price of thick early japonica rice did not change, the situation was weak. Due to continued arrivals, the price of thin japonica rice continued to fall by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. Duyangjian and Yin Bian Yuan rice were flat.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were about 20 sources from the rivers. The weather was sunny and warm, but the market appetite was weak. Prices of various goods showed a downward trend. The price of Zhongjue white japonica and Yangjian rice fell by nearly 0.1 yuan. Du Jian rice fell by a small amount. Yin Bian Yuan rice sales were good, and the price was firm. Other rice varieties were weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean oilcake market saw no transactions due to exchange deliveries, and news of falling prices from Dalian led to a softening of sentiment in the market. Trading suddenly became quiet. Oilcake slices were not opened, but soybean oil and peanut oil may not be disappointing, as raw materials from producing areas are scarce and prices are rising daily, so it is not easy to fall too much. Customers from other provinces inquired about soybean oilcake less. The market was quiet and stable. There were still buyers for soybeans from inland mills and this street, totaling 3 railcars of Harbin beans, 1 railcar of Tieling beans, 200 packages of Chongming yellow sand beans, and 20 packages of Pinghu Du beans. Prices are temporarily stable.</p>

<p>Recently, the Yokohama silk market has been strong, and Lyon silk sales are gradually activating.

Tea factories such as Zhengtài, Chùi Chang, and Rentai have all started producing new goods. The opening price is between 41 and 42 yuan. It is said that the quality of the new tea is very fine, with Zhenmei accounting for 60 to 70%. Before the tenth of this month, it can be packed and shipped to Shanghai for sale.</p>

<p>The sugar market remained weak yesterday. There were rumors of a tax cut, but even if implemented, a unified tax would have to be added to offset the reduction. In effect, it is as if there were no cut. If this statement is correct, then the sales of smuggled sugar will not expand, and the price of sugar can be expected to gradually stabilize.

<p>According to news from the producing area of Tianjin red dates, there have been windstorms there recently, and there is fear of deficient new stock in the future, so the purchase price has already risen by 0.05 yuan. There are still 6,000 pieces in storage in Tianjin and only 4,000 pieces in various producing areas, while the current price is still flat, so the trend is very strong. Local firms are guarding a tight market, and are trying to procure from Tianjin. It is expected the prospect will be promising.

<p>The narrow strip steel market has been quite brisk recently, but in the last few days, due to the expiry of four lots of long-term contracts and tight credit, appetite has suddenly become sluggish.

Recently, due to the depressed market situation in various places, the purchasing power of foreign firms is very weak, and the building industry in this street is also sluggish, so the overall transaction of local nails is rather stagnant. Fortunately, the price has not fallen. The price is still 6.2 yuan per barrel, doubling the price. Yesterday, only 3-400 barrels traded.</p>

<p>May Day Commemorative Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e217">Commemorating "May Day" and the Way Out for Chinese Laborers <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Jingshi</p>
<p>"May Day" is an international labor day. Its creation was paid for by the blood and lives of workers around the world. After fifty-two years, the goals of the "May Day" movement have gradually changed, but this great day is still forever worthy of fervent commemoration by workers around the world.</p>
<p>On October 7, 1884, the eight major internationals in the United States (referring to the United States and Canada) and other labor organizations held a joint congress in Chicago, resolving to hold demonstrations every May 1st to demand an eight-hour workday, and a nationwide general strike. May 1st, 1886 was designated as the first demonstration day. This can be said to be the beginning of the "May Day" movement, and also the beginning of the most glorious page in the global workers' movement.</p>
<p>Our research shows that the European Industrial Revolution was launched independently, while the Chinese Industrial Revolution was passively forced by external forces. Because the Industrial Revolution in various European countries soon caused a panic of excess production capital and a lack of raw materials, in order to remedy this panic, the imperialists rushed to open up colonies abroad as reservoirs for domestic production capital and raw materials. China was the most ideally suited for this role and was the ideal place for imperialists. They successively invaded with their superior military, political, and economic power, utilizing their surplus capital and China's natural resources and cheap labor to create their strong nation status and obtain various illegal benefits. China itself was unable to embark on the road of industrialization due to foreign oppression, but it still could not escape the control of the imperialists. The national industry was unable to develop independently and could hardly maintain the status quo. In recent years, the near bankruptcy of major industries such as silk, yarn, and flour has been a clear example. The Industrial Revolution has not been successful, and the countryside is collapsing rapidly due to the deepening economic influence of imperialism.</p>
<p>So, broadly speaking, China has not yet formed a labor-capital class division. All actual distinctions, as Sun Yat-sen said, are "nothing more than big poverty and small poverty." Because both entrepreneurs and laborers suffer under the same oppression from foreign races. The cause of China's labor problem is not domestic, but the aggression of international imperialism. Therefore, the solution to China's labor problem is not a narrow class struggle, but how to overthrow imperialism. In other words, China's labor problem is the entire national problem. Only when the entire nation achieves independence and liberation can laborers achieve true happiness. This is the characteristic of China's labor problem, and it is completely different from the labor problems of other capitalist countries. We should recognize this.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nationalist Party is the only party in China with the most history and power to save China. The Three Principles of the People is a great strategy for the revival of China. The Three Principles of the People advocates equal treatment of all ethnic groups domestically and joint struggle with small and weak ethnic groups externally in the national independence movement. In this situation, not only must the people of the country unite and fight against foreign enemies, but also the small and weak ethnic groups must unite into a strong war front to defeat imperialism.</p>
<p>In addition, the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People is the only key to solving China's labor problem. Its method is to control capital and equalize land rights, gradually transfer capital and land to public ownership through gradual and peaceful means, abolish private ownership, complete the social revolution, and enable the majority of people to live and work in peace and contentment, free from the threat of life panic. From this, it can be seen how much enthusiasm and determination the Chinese Nationalist Party has for saving the vast majority of laborers. Similarly, only by working hard under the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party can the laboring masses obtain definite guarantees.</p>
<p>However, we do not deny that the Principle of People's Livelihood has not yet been implemented, and the suffering of Chinese laborers has not been alleviated in the slightest, but has instead increased daily. This is not because the Three Principles of the People is ineffective, nor is it because the Chinese Nationalist Party is not working hard. It is really that the aggression of imperialism is intensifying day by day, preventing the completion of nationalism. Since the nation cannot be independent, the Principle of People's Livelihood cannot be implemented at all. This is enough to prove that if the forces of imperialism remain in China for one more day, Chinese laborers and people of other classes cannot be liberated. Only by concentrating our strength and contributing to the party, strengthening the party's actions, and realizing the party's principles as soon as possible, can the Chinese nation break away from the shackles of imperialism and achieve independence. This is the recognition and awakening that we should have when commemorating "May Day," and it is also the true way out for Chinese laborers.</p>
<h3 id="e218">The May First Movement and the International Labour Organization <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Haifeng</p>
<p>During the active development of industry in the 19th century, capitalists held all the advantages and privileges, manipulating production and distribution and treating workers' labor as a commodity, exploiting them arbitrarily. Unable to endure this, workers gradually developed a consciousness of uniting to resist. The May First Movement was conceived in this context.</p>
<p>The United States at that time was a newly emerging industrial nation. The years after 1873 were plagued by economic panic, unemployment soared, and the working conditions of workers deteriorated even further. On October 7, 1884, eight major international and national labor organizations in the United States convened a joint conference in Chicago, resolving that May 1st each year would be the date for demonstrations demanding an eight-hour work system, using a general strike as a method of demonstration. On May 1, 1886, the first demonstration movement was indeed held, with great success. However, more than 40,000 workers in Chicago had not yet achieved this goal and had to continue the strike to realize their demands. On May 3, workers in Chicago gathered near the McCormick Reaper Works, and the notorious Chicago Haymarket Affair occurred on that day. Although the American labor movement temporarily declined due to this incident, the spirit of the May First Movement did not disappear and spread to Europe. Therefore, in 1891, the May Day Massacre of Fourmies also occurred in France.</p>
<p>In 1889, the Second International (formerly known as the International Socialist Congress, now the International Labour and Socialist Party) convened its founding congress in Paris, resolving that May 1st would be International Workers' Day, designating it as a day for class-conscious workers around the world to cease work and hold demonstrations. Since then, the spirit of the May First Movement has greatly expanded beyond its original demand for an eight-hour work system, becoming a demonstration of workers' self-liberation. After several instances of bloodshed, it was finally recognized by governments around the world, and laws were enacted stipulating that work should cease on May 1st with wages paid.</p>
<p>Fifty years have passed since the May First Movement began in 1886. This period has included one World War, which not only provided workers in various countries with significant lessons but also awakened the governments and capitalists of various countries. This led to a greater understanding that the pursuit of social peace must begin with improving the painful lives of workers. Rather than waiting for demonstrations and bloodshed before accepting workers' demands, it would be better to gather together in peacetime to exchange opinions and achieve improvements in workers' lives through peaceful means. It was with this aim in mind that the International Labour Organization, jointly organized by governments, employers, and workers of various countries, came into being.</p>
<p>We know that the original demand of May First was to reduce working hours to eight hours per day. However, although a small number of countries adopted it before the European War, most countries still had not implemented it. Recognizing this, the International Labour Organization stated in its constitution: "The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries." The contracting countries also acknowledged that "all States should make an endeavour to establish a system of eight hours a day or forty-eight hours a week as the standard to be aimed at where it has not already been attained." Based on this principle, the first session of the General Conference in 1919 formulated a draft convention to promote the eight-hour system to countries around the world through international agreements. Countries that ratify this convention must earnestly implement this system.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that before the establishment of the International Labour Organization, the demands of workers relied entirely on their own demonstrations to obtain them. The achievements made were not only not widespread but also could not obtain thorough government guarantees. However, since the establishment of the International Labour Organization, all workers' demands can be raised at the International Labour Conference, discussed jointly with governments and employers, and international conventions can be formulated and promoted uniformly in various countries. In terms of the scope of achievements, this is naturally far greater than the achievements gained by the workers' movement in a single country or region. In terms of guaranteeing achievements, a country that ratifies a convention must enact a law to implement it. It goes without saying that the law is an ironclad guarantee. Therefore, this method of liberating workers does not require severe measures and can achieve better results, which is a significant progress.</p>
<p>Today, because of advancements in production technology, workers should also enjoy more leisure time. During periods of severe unemployment, working hours should be reduced to increase employment. Therefore, there is a demand for a 40-hour work week. This demand did not require demonstrations or bloodshed from workers but has already been recognized in principle by various countries. This is an achievement of the democratic International Labour Conference.</p>
<p>The 17th International Labour Conference in 1933 began discussing the issue of the 40-hour work week. Subsequent conferences also continued to discuss it. It was not until the conference last year (1935) that a draft convention on reducing working hours to 40 hours per week was formulated. All countries that ratify this convention should recognize: "The principle of the 40-hour week shall be applied in such a manner that the standard of living is not reduced in consequence. The adoption or facilitation of such measures as may be judged appropriate to secure this end is incumbent upon countries approving this measure. Each country shall be responsible for the implementation of this principle in various occupations in accordance with the details set forth in the convention." Currently, conventions have been formulated based on this principle, including the "Reduction of Hours of Work (Glass-Bottle Works) Convention, 1935" adopted by the 19th Conference. Similar draft conventions are currently being drafted to ensure that this reform can be universally implemented in public works, construction, the iron and steel industry, the coal mining industry, and the textile industry. The 20th International Labour Conference will be held in Geneva on June 4, 1936, to decide on the implementation of the 40-hour work week in the above industries. In addition, issues such as the printing and binding industry and the chemical industry may be included in the agenda of the 1937 conference.</p>
<p>In summary, the spirit of the May First Movement—liberating workers and raising the living standards of workers—can be said to be in line with the goals of the International Labour Organization. Therefore, the formulation and implementation of international conventions can also be said to be a manifestation of implementing the spirit of the May First Movement. On the one hand, the movement has progressed from the eight-hour day to the forty-hour week. On the other hand, the method has evolved from demonstrations, strikes, and bloodshed to a democratic and peaceful legislative approach. This kind of evolution can indeed be celebrated by the labor community. When commemorating May First, we should also hope that the workers of the world will jointly support this progressive International Labour Organization so that it can continue to work for the benefit of labor!</p>
<h3 id="e219">How to Commemorate Labor Day <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xingya</p>
<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of International Labor Day.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, 360,000 workers in Chicago, USA, launched a struggle to improve their lives by demanding eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of education. Currently, in some capitalist countries, the "three eights" system has been largely implemented, and in some countries, working hours have even been reduced to less than seven hours. The development of world industrial technology has made the demands of workers fifty years ago largely inapplicable to the current environment.</p>
<p>China is an industrially backward country, and the living standards of workers are obviously many times lower than those in capitalist countries. The commemoration of Labor Day in China began as late as 1920 in Shanghai. Now, sixteen years have passed since the first commemoration, and under the leadership of our Party, the lives of workers throughout China have seen significant improvements. However, these small improvements are not enough. Therefore, we must work harder to complete the tasks set by the workers of the past, the tasks they left behind.</p>
<p>However, we should understand that the main task of commemorating Labor Day in China at present is not simply to realize the "three eights" system. China is a country with backward living standards and a not very widespread education. In recent decades, the oppression and aggression of the great powers have prevented our national economic construction from making any major progress. After the World War, our country's main industries, such as cotton mills and silk factories, these textile industries, are clearly falling into bankruptcy and instability. The large-scale collapse of the rural economic organization and the stagnation of emerging industries have brought the national economic crisis to the point of being almost unmanageable. Naturally, in this state of industrial exhaustion, it is not easy to improve the lives of workers; it is not easy to reduce working hours. Therefore, in China, especially in Shanghai, this industrial area, there are still many workers struggling in work that is more than ten hours. Adequate education and adequate rest are even more out of the question.</p>
<p>In this situation, if we currently take the realization of the "three eights" system as the object of struggle, it will not be easy to achieve, and it cannot be achieved. Because China's factory capital is small, and it is also mostly in a precarious situation. If working hours are reduced, then wages will be reduced, and workers will not be able to live. If working hours are reduced and wages are increased, then the factory's output will mostly not be enough to cover costs. Therefore, the commemoration of Labor Day by Chinese workers, the commemoration of Labor Day by all Chinese people, has a different method from that of other countries, but it has the same meaning.</p>
<p>That is to say, the first meaning of our commemoration of Labor Day lies in developing China's national economy, improving production methods, improving production technology, and implementing labor-capital cooperation, to resist the aggression of imperialism and to promote the development and prosperity of the national economic structure. The second meaning lies in enabling all industries in the country to proceed under a systematic and step-by-step plan, so that they can develop and become rationalized. The third meaning lies in promoting production education and literacy movements, to popularize the education of the working masses. The fourth meaning lies in making all labor a kind of national service labor, all becoming an element of the Chinese nation's self-reliance.</p>
<p>We all understand very well; if the production technology of China's industry is not intensified and improved, and labor and capital do not earnestly cooperate, then our national industry will not be able to compete with the industry of the great powers, that is, Chinese factories will not be able to stand and develop. Therefore, Chinese workers' demand for improvement in their lives can only be achieved through thorough cooperation with factory owners and merchants. Promoting the national industry through cooperation, and promoting the rationalization of production technology through cooperation, then the factory can survive, and the lives of the labor can naturally be improved. This is the special significance of our commemoration of "May 1st" today, which must be known.</p>
<p>At the same time, whether education is widespread or not is directly proportional to the progress of production technology. Countries with advanced education and technology in the world, such as Switzerland, England, America, Germany, and Russia, which country is not the most advanced country in production technology? Therefore, if we want to universally realize the eight-hour education and eight-hour rest system, we must first promote the improvement of production tools and realize the increase in the quantity and quality of production materials. The development of production is the cause, and the promotion of education is the result. If we want to obtain this result, then we must regard labor as an obligation to promote the national industry and an obligation to complete the national revolution. We only fear that we do not have more physical and mental strength to contribute to the country and the nation, and not that we are shouting the slogan of completing the "three eights" system while the national industry is on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>In short, Labor Day this year and today has a special meaning in China. This meaning lies in that it is not only a memorial day for reducing working hours, but also a memorial day for production and construction; it is not only a memorial day for the victory of workers, but also a memorial day for the future national victory of us. How are we going to win this memorial day? Today, we only have to work hard to produce and work hard to serve. To carry out national economic construction with the greatest strength; to strive for the development of China's national industry with the greatest effort. Only in the success of national economic construction can we truly achieve the realization of the "three eights" system, and can we truly complete the task given to us by the workers of the world fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Therefore, this year's "Labor Day" is the labor service day of the Chinese people, and it is the creation day of the national economic construction of the Chinese nation. Promoting this great economic construction and carrying out active labor services is the work of commemorating "Labor Day" this year and today.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Standardization of International Telegrams <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Min</p>
<p>Today in the 20th century is truly the century of standardization. If you don't believe it, look at the standardized clocks we use—the electric clocks lining the streets—the standardized ping pong balls we play with—like those from the Huanqiu brand—and even the so-called standardized beauty. If things continue like this, everything will soon be standardized! Going a step further, if the "clocks" are standardized, the "balls" are standardized, and everything is standardized, but no one uses or plays with them, what good is the standardization? Therefore, we hope that things in the world can quickly become standardized one by one, and at the same time, we hope that people can enjoy these "standards" as much as possible, without going against the times or moving backward!</p>
<p>"International telegrams" are a cutting-edge communication tool of the times, and of course, they need to be standardized even more! However, "telegrams" can absolutely not be compared to "beauty." When beauty reaches old age, it can never be standardized, but "telegrams" either are not standardized, or if they are standardized, they must remain standardized. Because "telegrams" are not easily standardized, the conditions are also very demanding. At least, they must possess: 1. thorough service; 2. rapid transmission; 3. accurate text; 4. no damage to national rights.</p>
<p>Via CGRA, the international wireless telegraph, how beautiful are the bright red neon lights? This is the big sign of standardized international telegrams! This is also an international communication undertaking that is worthy of people's support for winning glory for the 20th century! It—CGRA—has unexpected conveniences—thorough service; it has direct circuits to various countries, the latest automatic high-speed machines, and scientific management methods—rapid transmission; it has specialists in charge of proofreading, and skilled telegraph operators responsible for reporting—accurate text; it also has extremely fair and reasonable regulations for sharing telegraphic fees, and it is purely state-owned and state-operated, free from the control and oppression of foreign forces—no damage to national rights. In short, everything about it fully meets the conditions for standardization, and it has now been supported by the general public as an authority in international telegraph routes.</p>
<p>The wheel of time keeps turning, we should bravely move forward! We should be the pioneers of the times, and never be content to chase after the times and lag behind! To those engaged in trade in the new era, this era is our era, not the era of old merchants who wear old glasses and only know how to write routine accounts. We should use the new weapon—telegrams—to fight for the final victory, not abandoning timely communication methods, but adopting the international wireless telegram of the era. Merchants in the new era should pay attention to the following slogans:</p>
<p>Long live the standardized international wireless telegraph CGRA!</p>
<p>Support the standardized international wireless telegraph that wins glory for the 20th century!</p>
<p>Not using the standardized international wireless telegraph CGRA is going against the times and moving backward!</p>

<p>Chinese Cipher Text: Any code translated using a specially compiled Chinese cipher book is called Chinese cipher text. Each character in this cipher should consist of a group of four or five numerals. A telegram whose text is entirely written in Chinese cipher or a mixture of Chinese plain language and cipher is a Chinese cipher telegram. The price per character is doubled (two jiao), which is higher than the price of plain language. Therefore, if commercial firms that use Chinese ciphers to send telegrams can compile a five-code cipher book with commonly used idioms such as "message received," "ship goods quickly," "remittance sent immediately," "stop payment on draft," "price increased, goods out of stock, ship quickly," etc., it will be more economical to send telegrams. It is very uneconomical to use four codes to represent one character. Foreign cipher telegrams often contain only three or four words, which is very brief, while the number of characters in our country's cipher telegrams is not less than the number of characters in plain language telegrams. The reason for this is probably that people do not know how to use idioms to compile ciphers.</p>
<p>Foreign Plain Language: Foreign plain language is written in one or more languages ​​approved for international telegraphic communication, with clear meaning, and each phrase retains the original meaning of the language used. A telegram completely written in foreign plain language phrases is a foreign plain language telegram. However, it is still considered foreign plain language in the following situations: (a) House numbers and all kinds of numbers written in Arabic numerals, with no secret meaning; (b) Telegraphic registered addresses, whether used as the name and address of the recipient or the signature of the sender; (c) Commercial logos; (d) Exchange rates; (e) Letters representing signals in signals and ship telegrams, representing signals in the International Code of Signals; (f) Common or commercial abbreviations commonly used in communications, such as Fob Cif Cat Sup lbs YMCA, etc., but only those listed in dictionaries or specially approved by the Ministry of Communications are allowed; (g) The verification words or numbers at the beginning of the text in bank and similar telegrams, up to five letters or five numerals. In addition, the compound words approved for use in English plain language telegrams should be based on the second edition of Webster's International Dictionary (Webster’s New International Dictionary Second Edition 1935).</p>
<p>Foreign Cipher: Foreign ciphers are divided into two types: code and cipher text. Foreign code is composed of invented words that do not contain the original meaning of the characters used, or composed of a mixture of real characters and invented words. Each word must not exceed five letters and must not contain accented letters, regardless of the method used to compose it. A telegram completely written in foreign code words, or a mixture of code words and plain language words, is called a foreign code telegram. The business identifier for international foreign code telegrams is Cdo. Cde telegrams sent between Tunis, Libya, Tangier, Algeria and other places by European and other countries are charged at 70% of the full price. Our country is part of the European and foreign system, so it is most cost-effective to use code to send international telegrams. Code telegrams may also contain plain language words or numbers and groups of numbers, but they must not exceed half of the number of chargeable words contained in the text and signature. Otherwise, they must be charged as cipher text. Those who use code to send international telegrams should pay attention to this. Foreign cipher text can be divided into two types: (a) composed of single or groups of numerals, containing secret meanings; (b) characters. words. names. or groups of letters formed, not meeting the regulations of plain language and code, but wordings composed of a mixture of numerals and letters, containing secret meanings, are not allowed to be used. Telegrams completely written in foreign cipher text, or containing cipher text, are foreign cipher text telegrams. Foreign telegrams whose text does not meet the regulations of plain language or code are also regarded as cipher text telegrams. Each word in foreign cipher text telegrams sent abroad is charged at the full price, so it is not as cost-effective to use cipher text to send international telegrams as it is to use code. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e222">Reasons and Methods for Hoping Telephone Users to Cooperate <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Linsheng</p>
<p>The business of the telephone bureau develops with the increase of users, and users are satisfied with the rapid communication because of the complete installation and proper management of the telephone bureau. Therefore, both parties have a close relationship that cannot be separated. If the number of users decreases day by day, it will naturally have a great impact on the telephone bureau's business. If the telephone bureau does not pay attention to installation and management, then users will pay monthly fees but not get the benefit of rapid communication, and they will definitely feel very distressed. Therefore, the development of the telephone business and the speed and convenience of using the telephone are not one-sided demands, but the consistent needs of both parties. In other words: the former is not only what the telephone bureau hopes for, but also what the users agree with; the latter is not only what the users feel is convenient, but also what the telephone bureau welcomes. Business development and the convenience of using the telephone are like two rings of one thing, with interconnected relationships: there is also a relationship of cause and effect. It is difficult for a bureau whose business is not developed to have good equipment and strict management; and the result of lax management and incomplete installation will definitely not make users feel the convenience of communication, and at the same time, there will be no hope of business development.</p>
<p>Based on the above theory, we can know how important and essential it is for the telephone bureau and users to cooperate with each other. If both parties can cooperate, the telephone bureau can achieve the goal of business development, and users will not sigh at the waste of monthly fees; they can get the pleasure of convenient communication.</p>
<p>The method of cooperation is mutual, not one-sided. Here, let's first talk about the method of cooperation between the telephone bureau and users, and then talk about how users should cooperate with the telephone bureau.</p>
<p>A: For the telephone bureau, I think it is necessary to do the following things.</p>
<p>(1) The telephone bureau must be absolutely strict with the management of operators. Any events that can make users feel unhappy, such as wrong numbers, taking money during calls, and double connections, must be prevented from happening absolutely.</p>
<p>(2) Operators must be gentle and humble towards users, and speak politely.</p>
<p>(3) When users have questions, the information desk must answer truthfully, even if the matter is not within the scope of the answer, it should be answered as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to explaining the reasons truthfully when users question, if the fault lies with the operator, it should be open and honest and tell the user how the operator will be punished.</p>
<p>(5) If the telephone is damaged, repair it immediately (except at night). If it can be proven that the damage to the machine is unintentional, the situation should also be considered and appropriate measures should be taken.</p>
<p>(6) Personnel should be sent to the telephone installation locations of users to inspect and if users have dissatisfaction or misunderstandings, the inspectors are responsible for explaining. Sometimes they can try calling the telephone on the user's machine to verify the performance of the operator's connection in the bureau.</p>
<p>(7) A "User Report Form" should be printed and distributed. The form should be divided into several grids "For example: Speed of connecting calls", "Politeness of language", "Any wrong connections or taking money during calls" and other inconvenient places... Users should be asked to fill out and send one copy every quarter or half a year, and the bureau can use this as the basis for individual improvements.</p>
<p>(8) Users are welcome to send people to the bureau for on-site investigation, so as to eliminate all misunderstandings and enhance the friendship between the two parties.</p>
<p>B: For users, the following things should be done:</p>
<p>(1) Users should use the telephone in accordance with the methods stipulated in the telephone directory.</p>
<p>(2) Automatically restrain the talking time, do not be too lengthy, so as not to hinder others from calling this user and waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) When a telephone failure occurs, or it is suspected that someone is playing with it, notify or question the place notified as shown in the directory.</p>
<p>(4) If there are any unsatisfactory events, please do not scold on the machine, but notify the responsible personnel of the bureau in writing or verbally.</p>
<p>The above is just a list of a few points, and of course, there are bound to be omissions. If both parties have the sincerity to cooperate, a satisfactory result can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Methods to Avoid Damaging Submarine Cables <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Please pay special attention, ship owners</p>
<p>In recent months, submarine cables between Shanghai and Nagasaki, Shanghai and Yantai, and Qingdao and Sasebo have been damaged by fishing boat anchors, leading to frequent repairs and communication disruptions. Although the Ministry of Communications has requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to strengthen protection measures, the vastness of the sea and the large number of fishing boats make it difficult to implement effective protection in practice. Therefore, the maintenance of submarine cables depends on ship owners understanding and avoiding methods that cause damage. Recognizing this, our national telecommunications authorities have previously printed promotional pamphlets detailing methods to avoid damaging submarine cables, available for public request. The reporter now extracts key points for publication, hoping that ship owners will pay close attention and jointly maintain the safety of communications.</p>
<p>Methods to Avoid Colliding with Submarine Cables</p>
<p>(A) If a ship knows the location of a submarine cable, it must not anchor within a reasonable distance of the cable and must not lower fishing gear. Information on the location of cables within China's territorial waters can be obtained from waterline companies or the local telegraph office. These agencies also provide maps of submarine cable locations to ship owners free of charge. Ship owners who have not yet obtained these maps are urged to do so promptly.</p>
<p>(B) Ships must not approach or lower fishing gear within one nautical mile of a cable repair ship. According to international maritime regulations concerning such ships, repair ships must display prominent markers on the mast, consisting of two red balls (or red lights) suspended horizontally, with a white ball (or white light) in the middle. They must also display warning lights above the captain's navigation room during cable repairs to ensure caution. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e224">Q&amp;A Column <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>This publication has created a Q&amp;A section. Members of the public are welcome to inquire about unclear aspects of telegram and telephone sending and receiving procedures, telecommunications regulations, or any telecommunications knowledge. This publication welcomes and answers inquiries.</p>
<p>(1) Dai Hongsheng, Tunxi, asks: I recently heard that domestic magnet-type telephone sets are available. Where can I buy them? Our business plans to purchase one. Please advise.</p>
<p>(Answer) Zhongtian Electric Factory at 45 Shandong Road, Special District No. 1, Tianjin, sells domestic magnet-type telephone sets. Please inquire directly for pricing.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Yan Minzhi, Huaining, asks: Regarding Article 102 of the domestic telegraph business rules, "When sending two or more telegrams at the same time, only one special delivery fee is charged, but this does not apply if they are not addressed to the same recipient." If two telegrams are delivered simultaneously to individuals A and B within the same store, is only one special delivery fee charged, or are two still charged?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to regulations, if the telegraph bureau delivers special delivery telegrams to individuals A and B within the same shop or residence, and they are not the same recipient, two special delivery fees should be charged.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Huang Zixing, Changsha, asks: If a sender includes a few difficult-to-translate words in a Chinese telegraph and the telegraph bureau must translate them, how will the fees be charged?</p>
<p>(Answer) All words translated by the telegraph bureau will be charged a translation fee per word, in accordance with regulations. For example, if the telegraph bureau translates two words, a translation fee of two cents will be charged.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Hardness of Literature <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>"Literature is soft."</p>
<p>In the past, people often said and wrote this.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this statement is correct, hardness and softness are simply matters of nature, without any good or bad relationship. As Zhuangzi said, "Everything has its own rightness, everything has its own suitability." Hardness has its uses, and softness also has its needs. Gold is more expensive than copper, not entirely because its color is more brilliant and pleasing, but because it has toughness and can be stretched. Although this is not a good example of gentleness overcoming strength, it is clear proof that "soft is not necessarily bad."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the hardness of a play is higher than that of a novel. Although plays no longer need to strictly adhere to the "three unities," time and place must be consistent within the same act or scene; much artifice is required, resulting in a rigid outcome. Poetry is essentially verse, and its sound is harmonious when read aloud. If the rhyme is not properly adhered to, it feels stiff, indicating that poetry should be soft, so its hardness is even lower.</p>
<p>In terms of schools of thought, the hardness of naturalist works is higher than that of romantic works because naturalists emphasize reason, while romantics rely on emotion. Naturalism seeks to be scientific, while romanticism emphasizes ideals; "reason" and "science" are both strict, so they are naturally harder.</p>
<p>Focusing solely on novels, from a writing perspective, novels written in third person are harder, while autobiographical novels are relatively softer. In autobiographical novels, even if the author is not the protagonist, they are always a part of the scene. Pretending to write based on personal experiences, they create an invisible center, reporting in a gentle and roundabout manner, making it easy for readers to sympathize, thus making it softer. Authors of third-person novels stand in the position of an observer, and their attitude is inevitably calm and strict, so it is naturally harder.</p>
<p>Literature is "the expression of personality." The hardness or softness of a work is directly proportional to the author's personality. Under this condition, it can be said that the output of female writers is generally lower in hardness than that of male writers—this is, of course, a generalization.</p>
<p>Writers are "products of their environment," and "local color" is highly relevant, so Western literature differs from Eastern literature. Comparatively, Western literature is harder—emphasizing reason, focusing on "fragmented descriptions"; Eastern literature is softer. "Timeliness" is also highly relevant. Ancient literature is softer because it is mostly a product of romanticism, while modern literature is harder—new literature is Europeanized, not only in China, but also in Japan.</p>
<p>"Nationality" plays an important role in the color of literature. This does not hinder the expression of the author's personality; it is a mutually causal continuation. Therefore, within the West, German literature has its own characteristics, and French literature has its own characteristics; in the East, Chinese and Japanese literature also have their own characteristics. From a nature perspective, German literature always feels harder than French literature, and Russian literature is naturally even harder, probably because of the cold climate, difficult living conditions, and the serious attitude of the authors.</p>
<p>Even within the works of a single author, the hardness varies. Generally, joyful moods are soft, while sorrowful moods are hard. Or, it may be that if one is casual, the hardness of the work is low; but if one is "stimulated by national crisis" and becomes serious, the hardness increases—at least, some people say this, and some people write this.</p>

<p>——Short Chronicles of Borderland Characters——</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's shoes."</p>
<p>The son saw his father rummaging through the box he brought back from school, holding things that the old man shouldn't see, and his face flushed.</p>
<p>"Shoes? Are shoes like this?"</p>
<p>"Dad, these are made of leather."</p>
<p>The father didn't look at the shoes, but directed his displeased gaze straight at his son's face.</p>
<p>"How much? Is this how you spend the money I give you? Huh?"</p>
<p>"Dad, they're not expensive, just, … only one dollar, only a bit more than cloth shoes… only thirty cents more."</p>
<p>The son forced a smile as he answered, completely concealing the actual price.</p>
<p>"This is still cheap? This is… let me try them on!"</p>
<p>The old man's expression softened, and as he said this, he sat down on the bamboo chair, wiped the muddy soles of his feet a few times with his sleeve, and put on those black and shiny contraptions.</p>
<p>"Ah, they fit perfectly, as if you bought them for me."</p>
<p>The old man made a sound of praise.</p>
<p>The son saw the dirty feet going into the shoes, secretly worried, but couldn't say anything, so he put on a flattering appearance and said,</p>
<p>"Dad, don't rush, let me fetch you a basin of water, do they fit? You can wear them from now on, I'll get another…"</p>
<p>"I'll wear what?" The old man put on one shoe and stood up, tilting his head, examining them with his eyes: "Aren't these hard to walk in?" A look of sudden recollection appeared on his face, "Ah, they look like boots from years ago!"</p>
<p>The mother was tidying the washed clothes in the next room, and when she heard the old man examining the things her son brought home, she worried that he would pursue the source of the money, implicating her, the old mother who had secretly given money to her son. When she realized that the old man was happy, she picked up a bundle of blue cloth clothes and folded them, and then walked to the door with a smiling face and said,</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to be a guest tomorrow? Your son gave them to you, so enjoy the blessing, right?"</p>
<p>"Young people care about appearance… I like that they're sturdy!" The old man bent down, using his fingers to feel the leather a few times, "What kind of leather is this? I don't think cowhide is this soft!"</p>
<p>"Dad, this is tanned leather, made with foreign methods."</p>
<p>The son replied while flashing a triumphant look at his mother, as if to say: I've tricked the old man this time.</p>
<p>The mother, standing behind the old man, puckered her lips and raised a finger to her son.</p>
<p>The old man, hearing that they were made with foreign methods, gently put down the shoes, put on a serious face, and said,</p>
<p>"In the future, don't buy any foreign goods!"</p>
<p>Then, he placed his hands behind his back and walked out the door. Just as he crossed the threshold, he turned back, with a loving expression, and instructed,</p>
<p>"Pick them up carefully!"</p>
<p>The mother saw the old man leave, and then complained to her son:</p>
<p>"Don't be so happy! You need to be more careful next time. Also, you should also put away those bottles and cups of yours!"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter! I know how to trick him now, unlike before…"</p>
<p>The son immediately began to hum a little tune.</p>
<p>The next day, the old man was going to be a guest, and looked at the patched-up worn shoes his wife had repaired, frowning and saying:</p>
<p>"Aren't there any without patches?"</p>
<p>The wife understood his meaning, and grabbed the son's leather shoes and threw them in front of him.</p>
<p>"You have ready-made ones, and you don't wear them? … What new shoes do you want?"</p>
<p>At the same time, she threw the patched cloth shoes under the bed.</p>
<p>The old man didn't speak, and slowly put on the leather shoes. Suddenly, he remembered something, and immediately took them off again.</p>
<p>"What? You're not going to wear them?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I wear them? … But, do you want me to wear them all the way there? Let the stones wear them out, good idea!"</p>
<p>The old man put on a new blue cloth suit, carried one leather shoe in each hand, and walked barefoot towards the fields.</p>
<p>The wife saw her son standing nearby with a pout, and said,</p>
<p>"You're afraid he'll wear them out? … He treasures them very much! … You should let him be happy for a while, then he'll be happy to give you school money.… The poor old man!"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the old man came back barefoot as usual, but he wasn't carrying the leather shoes in his hand.</p>
<p>The wife asked in surprise,</p>
<p>"Ah, the leather shoes?"</p>
<p>The old man was already tipsy, smiling and finding a stool to sit down.</p>
<p>"You'll never guess, today… Pour me a cup of tea, the vegetables are too salty!"</p>
<p>"Did you lose them? … You don't look like you did! … Oh, you drunkard, you're hiding them and playing with us!" The wife rolled her suspicious eyes, slipping them towards the old man's waist. Then she turned her head, pointed her mouth, "I don't like guessing, your son bought them back for you, if you lose them, not to mention he'll be sad, I won't let you get away with it!" Then she said to her son: "Go pour him a cup of tea, … he won't lose yours, if he loses them, I'll make him pay you back."</p>
<p>The son, looking depressed, reluctantly agreed and went to pour tea.</p>
<p>"Don't rush, after drinking tea, listen to me, … I was very thirsty along the way… The water in the rice paddies really doesn't taste good, it has a muddy smell, … Look, that Chen Santouzi was there too."</p>
<p>"Which Chen Santouzi?"</p>
<p>"Oh, have you forgotten? … That Chen Santouzi who wastes money, can't you remember him? … I'll tell you, once, someone brought a cow to sell to him, asking for fifty yuan. He squinted his eyes and glanced at it, turned around and walked away, shaking his hand and saying, I don't want it, I don't need one for fifty yuan, what am I going to do with it…? Bring me a good one, then I'll buy it! … In our eyes, one for fifty yuan is already very expensive, but he looked down on it! Later, they figured out his temper, and reworked that one worth fifty yuan, brushing its fur, and oiling its hooves and horns, and brought it again… Master Chen, this is a top-quality one, even if you search with a lantern, you won't find another one! … See how our Master Chen reacted, this time he looked at it again and again, from head to tail.… How much do you want?… How much? Master Chen, we wouldn't dare to take advantage of you, eighty yuan, not a penny less.… See how Master Chen reacted, again from tail to head, pretending to be unhappy and scolding, Nonsense, how can it be so expensive, you can't fool these people's eyes. Seventy yuan at most!… See, he still says his eyes are good, really made of bodhi seeds.… So the people replied to him, Master Chen, how would we dare to deceive you, to tell you the truth, we'll be struck by lightning if we overcharge you.… This fellow with clouded mind then said, Okay, leave it with me!… Haha, today he was also there as a guest."</p>
<p>The old man said to this point, saw his son bring tea, and while taking the teacup, stared at his son and asked,</p>
<p>"Why not? What would I gain by deceiving you? You gave me the money after all, and it was a certain amount. Where would I get more money to spend?"</p>
<p>The son pretended to be telling the truth.</p>
<p>"Yes, I also know, you don't have extra money to waste."</p>
<p>The old man nodded, then buried his head and drank tea.</p>
<p>The son then flashed his mother a triumphant look.</p>
<p>The wife urged the old man, saying:</p>
<p>"You drunkard, don't just babble, … tell me, where are the shoes? Did someone borrow them from you?"</p>
<p>"Where? Would you be willing to lend them out! Those kinds of shoes." The old man acted slightly reproachful, "These shoes are really strange, when you walk, they squeak, squeak, even before you enter the door, eight or nine heads stick out and shout: Oh, what's that sound!… Oh, foreign shoes!"</p>
<p>Then, he drank a mouthful of tea.</p>
<p>"That fellow Chen Santouzi grabbed me, … Aha, old man, you've become fancy too. How much did they cost? How much? I said: You guess, you guess,… Eight yuan,… Wrong, you guessed wrong.… Then, nine yuan.… Ugh, that foreign devil's thing, he really tricked him."</p>
<p>He took another sip of tea.</p>
<p>"They're really using salt like it's worth more than rice, the vegetables were so salty!… Later, I said to him, only thirty cents more than cloth shoes, one yuan.… One yuan? I'd be willing to pay three yuan! He was completely shocked. I said, are you really willing to pay? I didn't expect him to really take out three yuan. That fellow with clouded mind!"</p>
<p>"What, you really sold them?"</p>
<p>The wife widened her eyes.</p>
<p>"No? With so many guests, would I be willing to make you look bad! I said to him, I don't want to make money, why would I sell them? Then I said a polite thing, I could give them to you, but selling them? I'm really embarrassed…"</p>
<p>"What, old thing, you just gave them to him like that?"</p>
<p>The wife became a little anxious. The son looked even more uneasy.</p>
<p>"I'm not that stupid! An item worth one yuan, not like I stole it for free. That's worth five dou of grain. When I said that, I was afraid that the fellow would say, Okay! Just give them to me then. Everyone knows he's not very polite. I quickly continued, I don't like wearing foreign devil things. These are my kid's, he was unhappy wearing them today!"</p>
<p>The wife pursed her lips and smiled.</p>
<p>"You're really a sly old fox!"</p>
<p>"Ugh, you still say I'm a sly old fox! I was just a little too honest today. I said, it would have been good if they were bought for five yuan!"</p>
<p>The old man then took out three silver dollars.</p>
<p>"Ah, did you actually sell them? In front of so many people?" The wife immediately took a step towards him, asking with wide eyes, almost scolding, "Your skin is really… really thick!"</p>
<p>"There's no way around it! You don't know, Chief Zhang was also advising me. Think about it. How could I not agree to what he said?… That old monster often opens his mouth and it's all about donations, taxes, estimating and digging into your pocket, not leaving you any leeway. Today he was suddenly nice to me, leaning close to my ear and smiling: Sell them, it's good to sell them, earn two big yuan, and you can have your son buy another pair! I also calculated in my heart, not bad, the price of one shi of grain. I didn't care if people laughed or not, I just said that the chief ordered me to, so I had to obey. Really, if it wasn't for the chief speaking, who would be willing to lose face in public, especially since they were all laughing in such a strange way."</p>
<p>The son turned green with anger, and immediately walked towards the room.</p>
<p>"Stupid thing, are you angry? Come, I'll give you one, and go buy another pair!"</p>
<p>The son had no choice but to endure his anger, turned around and took it, but after walking a few steps away, the old man called out:</p>
<p>"Turn around, I'll give you another one… Buy another pair for me too!"</p>
<p>"What are you buying them for? Don't spend money carelessly!" The wife knew the actual price of the shoes and hurriedly stopped him, "If you don't have new shoes to wear, I'll make them for you!"</p>
<p>"No, I don't necessarily want to wear them, it's just that I'm afraid there are no other fools willing to pay three yuan to buy them."</p>
<p>The old man stood up, gave the silver dollars to his son, and walked away.</p>
<p>The son was so angry that he stamped his feet, narrowed his throat, and muttered in a low voice,</p>
<p>"It's really seeing a ghost! You old fool, people are selling them for eight yuan a pair!"</p>
<p>"Only eight yuan, didn't you tell me ten yuan!"</p>
<p>The wife asked the son in surprise.</p>
<p>The son's face turned red, and he stammered,</p>
<p>"Didn't I say ten yuan?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, you're all lying to me about the price! I really don't know, what a big waste you young people are!"</p>
<p>The wife pursed her lips unhappily.</p>
<h3 id="e227">That Boatman <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>When I returned to Singapore again, I immediately ran into the boatman who had once taken me off the ship. He warmly welcomed me, saying:</p>
<p>"You really came back! Good! Good! It's hard to be a human, but it's also happy to be a human!"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, after he finished work, he pulled me to a nearby coffee shop, saying:</p>
<p>"Let's have a cup of coffee. I told you, there are good coffee shops in Middle Street."</p>
<p>The coffee shop was still so crowded; various words, various characters, and various smokes.</p>
<p>I saw a fresh scar on his forehead, which hadn't yet scabbed over, and asked:</p>
<p>"Have you been fighting again recently?"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, fought a bit. Very refreshing."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"It's a small matter," he pulled out a cigarette and smoked it, then continued. "You know those sampan hands on the sea, the dock and the sea are in the palm of their hands. 'Newcomers' from the mountains will be cheated if they are not careful. Alas, forget it, forget it. Shanghai is at war, but they are smuggling × goods. Once I saw it, I said:</p>
<p>"Bay! What are you doing illegally? You'll earn any black or white money!"</p>
<p>"None of your business!" one of them said.</p>
<p>"Mind your mother's business!" A fist came out of my hand. That one fell into the boat, and several others climbed out from the stern and the cabin, holding wooden sticks. I was all alone. Running was the best option. Just as I picked up the oar, the first person struck my right forehead with a wooden stick. Annoyed, I grabbed his stick with force and swung it out. That one also fell; they all rushed over in a swarm. I grabbed the oar and rowed nimbly. Spitting a mouthful of saliva on the second person. Haha! They cursed behind me. Is that heavy wooden chicken as nimble as my little duck? Haha!"</p>
<p>"But you're bleeding." I said.</p>
<p>"What's the big deal. I've been in 'Mata Cu' prison and fined. What's a big deal?—Ha ha, how is Penang?" He looked at me.</p>
<p>"Nothing much. Everyone is complaining." I said.</p>
<p>"Complaining? What's so great about that. A person always has a way. Are they going to starve to death?"</p>
<p>"They can't compare to you!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Me? What's so great about me. I was driven out of my hometown by the gentry; not allowed to return. When I caught shrimp, I ran into the shrimp hut closing; when I opened a mine, I ran into people being laid off. What's so great about me."</p>
<p>"You can carry four or five hundred catties of goods; you can row a boat," I added, "you can also fight!"</p>
<p>"Alas, alas, forget it, forget it. The boss said to me: "From now on, don't go to sea; you can carry goods well. You always like to cause trouble." I said, "Okay, anything is fine." So now I'm not a boatman, but a cargo carrier."</p>
<p>The coffee shop was hot, the workers swallowed a piece of bread in one bite, laughing loudly. Shop assistants, managers, and young bosses were sipping coffee, discussing things in low voices.</p>
<p>He looked at me and said again:</p>
<p>"The manager warned me: "Don't cause any trouble, do your job well, lest you lose your job." What am I afraid of? Haven't I lost my job before? Even if I lose my job, so what? These days, it's enough not to starve to death. I won't starve to death, so I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid."</p>
<p>The sea nearby, the ship's whistle was sounding. He then remembered,—</p>
<p>"A few days ago, some fishermen from Sarawak came out to Singapore, they were preparing to return to</p>
<p>"Tangshan." They said: "Damn, the fish have all been caught, and the salted fish are worthless. Everyone is going back to Tangshan to starve."</p>
<p>""Starving is the same everywhere, isn't it?" I said.</p>
<p>"They didn't say anything. They seemed to have no idea what to do. Poor people! I thought:</p>
<p>""Why do people starve? Why do people starve? If it were me, I would—""</p>
<p>"What would you do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What? I'd live by fighting; after fighting, I'd go to jail to find food. After coming out, I'd fight again, and after fighting, I'd go back to jail. What's the big deal?"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha, I didn't expect you to be a natural fighting machine!" I laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"I'm not just a fighting machine," his face suddenly became serious, showing that he wasn't joking. "I'm also a rowing machine, a cargo-carrying machine, a machine for the gentry and bosses to vent their anger on!"</p>
<p>A small cigarette butt was thrown on the ground, and the remaining fire was still emitting smoke.</p>
<p>A shop assistant came over and shouted:</p>
<p>"Stop talking nonsense. Talking crazy all day long. "Xinji" (ship name) is here, go to work!"</p>
<p>So, he poured the remaining coffee in the cup into the saucer and drank it dry in one gulp.</p>
<p>Then, this dark face, strong body, broad and prominent forehead, tousled hair, thin gauze shirt, and shorts disappeared from my eyes. Leaving behind that forehead scar, and those pungent words, mixed in the chaotic water vapor and smoke, swirling in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Song of the Stars <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yaping</p>
<p>Our names are Stars,</p>
<p>Like spring flowers and autumn trees on earth,</p>
<p>Decorating the beautiful night sky.</p>
<p>We are the descendants of light,</p>
<p>The sun is our father,</p>
<p>The moon is our mother,</p>
<p>We have eternal life,</p>
<p>And an undying spirit that lasts ten thousand eons,</p>
<p>Standing high in the sky at night,</p>
<p>Casting a sparkling light upon the earth.</p>
<p>I love the still, windless lake,</p>
<p>The deep, boundless ocean;</p>
<p>I love the biting, invigorating cold wind of winter,</p>
<p>The nightingale's clear, fluent singing;</p>
<p>I love even more the dazzling myriad lights,</p>
<p>Which shoulder the same mission as we do,</p>
<p>Burning with heat, and great power,</p>
<p>Revealing light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Dark clouds are our enemies,</p>
<p>They often shade the azure sky,</p>
<p>The moon's face, and our eyes.</p>
<p>But we have never once surrendered,</p>
<p>Because we foresaw their weak life,</p>
<p>Like the embers of oriental fireworks,</p>
<p>A flash and they vanish without a trace.</p>
<p>When the east sky flashes with brilliant dawn,</p>
<p>We all hide in the heavenly palace to sleep,</p>
<p>Sometimes dreaming of the beautiful human world</p>
<p>And playing with lively, innocent children,</p>
<p>Sometimes dreaming of dark, hungry demons,</p>
<p>Exhausting all their strength in desperate struggles,</p>
<p>At dusk, the western sky is dyed with colorful clouds,</p>
<p>We rise from the twilight to our heavenly seats,</p>
<p>Following the beautiful moon maiden,</p>
<p>Happily, we begin our diligent work.</p>
<p>Thus, holding up lanterns in the dark night,</p>
<p>Never with weariness, or fear,</p>
<p>The sorrow of fools, and the terror of life and death,</p>
<p>Our names are Stars, cultivating the eternity of life in endless,</p>
<p>unceasing motion.</p>
