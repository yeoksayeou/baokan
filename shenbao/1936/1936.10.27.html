<h3>成都與重慶（下）</h3>
<p>— 長靑</p>
<p>成都的風景，報章上雜誌上曾有不少的紀載，總之是非常文雅而秀麗的，公共的園林如少城公園，支磯石公園，北城公園……的樹木，都是高高的聳在半空，各大街小巷，每家門前都栽有一顆楊柳或者梧桐洋槐桑柏……之類的樹木來陪襯陪襯，私人的公館裏面，園林更是特別的多，假使登高一望，屋頂上浮着綠幽幽的一片，成都原來是已經樹林化了。在落日紅霞的時候，簡直是一幅美麗的城市畫圖。重慶呢，可以供人遊覽的，除了南溫泉和北溫泉兩處外，更沒有較好的地方，全市少有見到樹林，人工培植出的公園風景，到底不如成都的來得自然。每一家人件的地力，好像一個被侵略的國家一樣，地盤縮小得非常可憐，房屋多是建築得那麽幾重高，但這幷不是普遍的紳土士階級所住的，大半都是幾家人或者十幾家人合住在一起，光綫很不容易的透露迪來，那樣陰暗而潮濕，住在裏面，眞使人窒息得不堪，一到夏天，更是熱得來使每一個入都感覺難受，傘氣候此起來，成都是再也溫和不過的了。</p>
<p>成都雖然處在四川最西的一角，而物質文明的開化，却並不落於人後，說到建設方面，倒像比重慶進步得早些，成都的馬路，無論是大街小巷，很早的就建築得平平坦坦的通着「東洋車：重慶現在還在建築城馬路，因爲城內地勢坡度的起伏，那被認爲已成過去的交通工具－轎子－依然盛行着。可是從當局就建設事業之進行上看，重慶實比成都努力的多，發展的快，重慶自來水管，已經很普遍的安置在每一個市民的住宅裏，從前戚覺到很困難的用水問題，現在已完全解决了。房屋的建築，比成都更要講究些，新村和市民醫院，也正在計劃中，至於市容的整飭和消防的設備，……這些，這些比起五年前確實已好到若干倍。</p>
<p>自從「四川爲民族的復興根據地」的口號打出來後，許多外省人便放開脚步跑進川來，成都也隨着重慶一天比一天的繁榮起來了。旅館餐館，茶館新添了許多，娛樂塲所正如雨後的春筍樣，蓬蓬勃勃的反而比重慶勝過一籌，被劃爲成都市特區的商業中心地帶，春熙路商業塲，總府街，東大街一帶，一到　問，霓虹照耀，遊人如織，各商號都放肆的做着誘惑人的宣傳．留聲器收音機一齊放開，競拉生意，熱鬧不亞於重慶。但一問起眞實的貿易情形，可以說門庭雖若市，而顧客却寥寥無幾，這不過充分的表現着都市經濟的外强中乾罷了。</p>

<h3>意德結合與歐局危機</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前日意外長齊亞諾訪問柏林與德元首希特勒及外長牛賴脫會見。决定關於兩國外交上的合作八點。這所謂「合作。」在形式上及言詞上看來。似乎可以解除兩國問的矛盾。把歐洲推上「建設」「和平」之途。在實際上則不然。意德的結合僅在奧國問題上由互爭覇權變為暫時妥協而在其他方面。由於這兩個法西斯侵略國家的「通力合作。」歐洲和平的危機。將益趨嚴軍。</p>
<p>我們試把齊亞諾所發表關於兩國合作的八點。加以考察。從第一到第四各點。可說是關於一般外交上的聯合卽對於西歐公約國聯問題和多瑙河各問題。兩國採取一致態度。第五點是對於西班牙的。兩國對於和它們相通聲氣的法西斯叛軍。表示黃許。這顯示着它們雖沒有正式承認叛軍政府。而承認之期當在不還。第六七兩點表示它們共同擁護法西斯。反對布爾希維克。第八是關於德國的承認意國兼併阿比西尼亞的。此外據說另有一個恊定。表示意國同意贊助德國恢復殖民地的要求。　沒有　布。</p>
<p>上述幾點。綜合言之。卽這兩個努力於推翻國際現狀向外擴張勢力的國家。已决定相互承認其足以妨碍和平的要求。而對於目前國際間維持現狀擁護和平的勢力。則採取一致敵視的態度。如所謂「促成西歐公約」卽是指意國對於德國在洛卡諾問題中的立塲。加以贊助。而德國的承認意國兼併阿比西尼亞。顯然是意國贊助德國收回殖民地的一個交換條件。至於目前國際和平制度中唯一基幹的國聯。兩國亦已根據其同樣反對的立塲。决定一致的對策。這樣所謂「通力合作。」若把「和平」「建設」等美麗的修辭除去。我們對於歐局的前途。實不敢樂觀。</p>
<p>非但不能樂觀。而且對於目前歐局的危機。我們將益感其不可收拾。最顯明的是西班牙的問題。西國叛軍與人民陣綫政府的鬥。爭誰為非法。誰為合法。國際間早經加以判斷。但在全世界民主勢力一致同情於西國合法政府之際。德意獨因為法西斯的氣味相投。及它們在地中海上和非洲的野心不惜破壞不干涉協定。竭力陰助叛軍。現在伊伯蘭半島的遍地流血。是受誰之賜。凡有正義感的人士。都會明白的。現在受到德意影響的葡萄牙。且已正式與瑪德里政府斷絕邦交。承認叛軍政府。作為德意承認叛軍政府的先聲。這種違反國際常態的行為。其所含嚴重的意義。是不容忽視的。而且由於德意的破壞不干涉協定。蘇聯亦已被迫而改取自由行動。今後地中海上衝突的發展。將有一發而不可收拾之勢。</p>
<p>這時候英法的應付態度。是極關重要的。法國的人民陣綫在團結上本來不够堅强。但這次急進社會黨大會以後。人民陣綫內部的裂痕。業已彌補。這是可喜的。但法國的對外政策是必須受到英國的。牽制的英國保守黨政府的頑固與工黨的孱弱無能。使英國對外政策一直徘徊於擁護集體和平制度及縱容法西斯侵略勢力之間。這種缺陷。直到現在。還沒有彌補。假使目前歐洲的危機更增嚴重。甚至造成最後的慘果。英國的三心兩意的政治家實在要負很大的責任。</p>

<h3>陶百川報告　歐美各國考察經過　昨在市府擴大紀念週中</h3>
<p>市黨部常務委員陶百川氏、去歲赴美留學、並赴歐美各國考察、已於上月返滬、吳市長特於昨日在市府大禮堂、召集各局職員、舉行擴大紀念週、請陶氏報告考察經過、茲記其報告辭如次、</p>
<p>美國　主席、各位同志、兄弟去歲赴美留學、得達生平志願、並順便赴歐洲各國遊歷、茲將所見報告於各位、本人在美國的時間較長、大家知道美國是黃金之國、但我所見到的美國、與理想中的黃金之國完全不同、在美國無論何處都可看到遊手好閒的人、卽在紐約也有乞丐、這實受世界經濟不景氣之影響、美國一萬二千萬的人口中、失業者達一千二百萬人、佔十分之一、其嚴重可知、政府的救濟失業方法、一是給錢、一是給工作、因此政府的開支很大、去年一年預算聯邦政府爲四十萬萬美金、各省政府爲二十萬萬美金、各縣鄉村政府爲六十萬萬美金、共計一年支出一百二十萬萬美金政費、中國每年僅九萬萬元、政費的來源、當然取之於民、所以美國人民、每人每年平均負担政府開支一百美金、黃金之國、也巳窮相畢露、且美國因政府救濟失業者、不能因事設人、故政治效率很低、但民間事業如工廠商店等效率則很高、</p>
<p>英國　在美居住一年多、卽至英國、感覺到英國的政治效率比美國高、其生活程度、人民的物質享受則比美國低、英國人做事頗能按步就班、寳事求是、不若美國之好高驚遠、在美國的學校、有時很好的校舍、或花園、時常拆掉、重新建築、其原因據說、時常拆建、足以流動財物、使建築師·工程帥·工人·以及木料廠、其他廠有生意可做、美國的確有把稻麥焚燒、或沉入海底、以求物價平衡的事、英國則頗能節約、</p>
<p>丹麥　由英至丹麥、丹麥給我一個深刻的印象、卽丹麥人民很快活、無盜賊、丹麥有八十餘萬人口、全國警察只有九百個、佔千份之一、所以布馬路上看不到警察、其原因蓋人民安居樂業、無用警察、上海的警察要佔百分之二、其他各國也至少在百分之二以上、丹麥之所以致此、靠合作制度之發達、無大富大貧階級、人民生活都在水平綫以上、</p>
<p>瑞典　瑞典市政府之建築、常麗堂皇、實屬罕見、其造價合中國幣三千五百萬、建築十二年始完成、爲全世界第一、但瑞典的皇宮、却並不如此富麗、據說市府建築如此偉大、實是吸收經濟的辦法、因爲他是世界弟一、所以遊客到瑞典參觀市政府的很多、使該處商業得以發達、故建築市府投資最多的屬商人、可以吸收遊客、招徠生意、可見富源不一定是礦業、風景也是富源之一、</p>
<p>芬蘭　在芬蘭很少見柏油路及水門汀路、大都是石子路、因爲國家很窮、但歐洲各國對美國的戰債、能每年償付的、祗有西臘及芬蘭這二個小國、因此在國際上很有地位、此次世界會中討論下屆開會地點、芬蘭亦參加力爭、在歐洲新興國家中很少、</p>
<p>蘇俄　至列寗格拉、蘇俄海關檢查很嚴、不能帶書籍、身畔所帶的錢也要報告、人民生活很淸苦、但很滿足、蘇俄工人每月上資不過一百四十盧布、連買一雙皮鞋都不够、但工人都說、他們有社會工資、如學校·圖書館·運動塲·等等、尤其是紅軍、養紅軍是他們最大的工作、一種宣傳的力量實在很大、我覺得獨裁國家之維持、至少具備四種條件、（一）武力、（二）私黨、（三）官傳（四）施恩於人、蘇俄的情形亦如此、現在分析世界上人民生活有四條綫、（一）饑餓綫、（二）溫飽綫、（三）儲蓄綫、（四）揮霍綫、有的國家、揮霍綫有之、飢寒錢亦有之、蘇俄在揮霍綫上沒有、飢寒錢上亦沒有、人民都有飯吃、因蘇俄生產以養民爲目的、</p>
<p>德國　由波蘭至德國、德國空軍國主義的國家、學美國完全不同、希脫拉上台後、加了一價靑年可以决鬭來解决爭執」的新會、所以誰的身上有創痕、即是英雄女子的擇愛大都崇拜英雄、小學生身上都携帶刀劍、不若美國招兵、須有一個大的運動、製成幻燈片映出、宣傳當兵的如何樣生活愉快、但願意當兵的却甚少、</p>
<p>法國　法國的情形、比衆不同、社會上充滿了奢穈的現象、法國每年香檳酒之消耗達五萬萬元、葡萄酒尚不在內、私娼公娼遍處皆是、所以有人以二個、W容法國、Wine與Woman、其淫穈享樂、實爲其他國家所少見、</p>
<p>意國　意大利這國家頗有朝氣、有精神、實是一個復興的國家、英索里尼本人辦公桌無抽屜、以免擱價公事、且收發將每大的公事、拿去未辦的、次日再送來、以警惕辦事人之不使公事監禁、於此可見一斑、人民愛國情精頗緊張、</p>
<p>結論　中國復興民族、可用兩句口號、（一）從根救起來、（二）迎頭趕上去、從根救起必須從人民訓練、經濟發展基本做起、能迎頭趕上去庶不致落後、故蔣委員長提倡的新生活運動、以及國民經濟建設運動、和快幹·實幹·硬幹·實是救國之道、新生活運動卽是人民訓練、國民經濟建設運動卽是謀經濟發展、是從根救起來的方汰、快幹·實幹·硬幹·卽迎頭趕上去的方法云、</p>
<h3>工廠檢查懸案　繼續交涉有待　就原協定再磋商折衷辦法　以不損害我國主權為原則　實部已呈行政院靜候核准</h3>
<p>滬租界工廠檢查懸案、因領團提出異議、交涉趨於停頓援、雙方草訂之協定原案、無形擱置、市府已據情咨復實部、茲據大公社記者探悉、實業部以工廠檢查主權、屬於我國、無論華租界區域內設立之大小工廠、必須遵照工廠法施行檢查、以保障工人之安全、滬租界雖情形特殊、而華工佔居最多數、各國領團所提之享有領事裁判權限問題、實母庸考慮、經於最近咨請市府繼續據理交涉、市府准咨後、當命秘書長俞鴻鈞、相機向公共租界工部局提出進一步之交涉、原協定儘可於不喪失我國主權原則之下、磋商折裏辦法、惟對領團方面無充分理由之要求、、决不讓步、俞氏已準備重與工部局總裁費信惇、約期直接談判、俾護早日解决、今援該案交涉、仍以俞費兩代表爲中心云、</p>
<p>又京訊、修改上海租界工廠檢查協定、實業部已呈請行政院鑒核、俟核准後、卽咨滬市府、根據所定原則、向工部局交涉進行、</p>
<h3>工商貸欵會　明秋結束　未收欵項有七十餘萬　末批於明年九月到期</h3>
<p>本市工商貸欵審查委員會、係於去年因工商界之請求、由中國·交通·中國國貨·等銀行、認集五百萬元所組繼成立、經財部委派蔡增基等爲委員、主持貸欵事宜、迄今已逾一年又四月、於上月三日、通過量後一批貸欵後、卽奉部令停止辦理、蓋自財部實施幣制新政策、經銀錢業之切實努力、金融已告穩定、銀根亦漸鬆弛、各銀行錢莊、有鉅欵貸放、故委員會無繼續之必要、茲據記者探悉、該會開辦後、每月召開會議、審查辦理、申請借欵、以紡織工廠爲最多、其他如經營小工廠及商店者、則數額較爲零星、該會規定條件甚嚴、且每戶貸欵、總數亦限定爲五千元、故陸續貸出總數、僅達九十餘萬元、除已到期收回者的十餘萬元外、現貸出之數額、計七十餘萬元、將按月於到期時催收、至明年九月間、量後一批到期收回援、該會卽行結束云、</p>
<h3>歐亞航空公司　悼陳鳳岐　本日在中國殯儀館</h3>

<h3>滬絲廠原料告罄　紹與絲廠停工　浙統制會春繭出讓難實現　華絲價格高漲銷路已轉暢</h3>
<p>江浙秋繭歉收援滬各絲廠因原料告罄、相率停工、期望浙蠶絲統制會將所存春繭平價出讓、華絲外銷轉暢、價格高漲、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>原料旣告罄</p>
<p>上海閘北南市租界等區域內開工絲廠、總計怡和積餘恒蒼等四十八家、車數總的一萬一千部、自江浙秋繭歉收、無錫永泰絲廠鉅量收買餘繭援、以致市上餘繭告罄、各絲廠均感原料缺乏恐慌、今閘北紹興絲廠、因原料告罄、於前日首先停工、至於開工各廠原料最多者、亦僅供二個月之需、</p>
<p>浙繭難出讓</p>
<p>各絲廠鑒於因原料缺乏停工、影響數萬工人之生計、均期望浙江省蠶業統制委員會所收之春繭、平價出讓與滬各絲廠商、得繼續開工繅絲、但浙省蠶絲統制委員會所收之春繭、已設繅絲委員會、委託杭州絲廠等繅絲、由推銷委員會向海外銷售、今已經先期拋出、所以平價出讓、事實上恐難辦到、</p>
<p>絲銷已轉暢</p>
<p>華絲歐美市塲、前因日絲傾銷、以致價格暴跌、銷路幾絕、國內綢廠用戶、因時局緊張、交易銳减、自上星期起華絲國外價格高漲、今已漲至一元七角三分美金、合國幣六百九十元左右、且銷路轉暢、國內綢廠用戶因謠言已息、銷路較前增加、至於上海各絲廠商因原料缺乏、均不敢拋售期貨、深恐屆時無法交貨云、</p>

<h3>馬寅初談　改進銀行保證制度</h3>
<p>新聲社云、近今社會間侵佔舞弊案件甚多、如日前報載美華銀行·通易信託公司·中國興業銀行、舞弊侵佔欺詐追訴案、此風日趨滋長之勢、據某統計家稱、去年金融界之舞弊案、達四十三起、計一百六十八萬餘元之鉅、可視爲社會嚴重之問題、名經濟學者馬寅初博士晤記者時、述其感想如下、我國職業界現行之保證制度、素沿用個人及舖保單制、此種制度、在目今社會經濟錯綜複雜之下、於各方面均感不切實用、流弊滋多、在舞弊案件發生之後、保證人每能盡符保證賠償之原旨、而爲人作保、允須盡無限責任、欲助人而反被累、咸憚於嘗試、因此在從業員方面、極感覓保之困難、此在銀行界爲允甚、吾人觀以年來舞弊侵佔被控案件、層見疊出、而無抑制之辦法、故改進保證制度、實爲社會各界一致之企望、然其如何能盡改進、亦頗費研究之事、茲據金融界人士謂、某銀行有廢除現行保證制度、建議「特種現金保證辦法」之意見書、近會見該項規則、係以相當現金、作爲保證、而採保險之精神、兼寓儲蓄之美意、以甲乙內三種保證金及連帶處分獎勵告發五原則合組而成、此項蹬金、含保證性質、如無舞弊事件、仍可發還、其作用在各行員聞有切身利害關係、可收互相規勉、消弭不良事件之發生、此種辦法、秉團體互助合作之精神、蛟簡單之保人制度、切實而合理、其意義判若霄壤、於科學化之人事管理、亦相符合、近世各國對於信用保證事業、無不力求完善、切實推行、而各機關向國內外保險公司投保信用險、所納保費雖鉅、其實並無積極作用、余觀該某行建議之「特種現金保證辦法」、其甲種保證金取法於英、乙種保證金取法於美、丙種保證金係斟酌吾國情形而規定、其整個辦法、大致與英國（NatioualProvimcial　BankLtd，London）銀行之現行保證制度相類似、吾國現行銀行保人制度之應廢除、可稱毫無疑義、然改革某種制度、須經縝密之研討、然後以堅毅之精神行之、如政府之廢兩改　、改革幣制、是其先例、余深望吾國金融界人士、對此問題、加以重視、而謀盡善之辦法、切實推行、或一行單獨提倡、或數行聯合辦理、豈獨從業者保證人之幸也、</p>

<h3>考察歐洲體育的感想（續）</h3>
<p>— 江良規</p>
<p>（三）女生男教問題</p>
<p>所謂女生男敎問題、『男敎員是不是可以敎女學生或者是絕對不可以敎的』、這個問題在國內的時候，常常聽到許多禮育界中的女士的高論，見到許多她們反對男敎員敎女學生的大作、當然、我們不敢說她們有什麽特殊的作用、但是至少認爲她們有點意氣用事、所以這次考察的時候、很注意這件事、直且想乘機詢問一下歐洲各國的情形、而有幾位考察團的女團員、先就把道個問題提出來了、結果每次的答覆是說他們的國家裏、男子敎女生的事很多，同時關於技術的訓練、多半是男子担任的』、在瑞典的時候、我特地和我的老師張滙蘭先生討論過一次這件事、結果我們却認爲男子可以敎女生、尤其是在技術方面、是容易奏效、不過在舞蹈或體操方面、女子是比較適宜些、本來這是個不成問題的問題、國內女同志們反對男子敎女生的理由是</p>
<p>A，男子不瞭解女生的生理狀况</p>
<p>B，男子不能體會女生的心理</p>
<p>其實這兩條埋由都是不能成立的理由、所謂生理的情形、做到體育敎員的人、我想確都知道、男女生理最大的區別、除了體能的不同外、就是『月經』了、當然、女生在經期理面、除了極和緩的活動外、是不適宜作激烈活動的、所謂女生生理情形我想就是道一點、至於說女生例假，羞於告知男敎員所以男敎員不易知道、這種情形也許有、但是道種思想是極端錯誤的、『月經』是正當的生理現象、决沒有什麽可以秘密的地方、例如胃裏的食物消化完了的時候、我們感覺至餓、道是同一的現象、餓的時候、尋覓食物與經期時是同樣神聖的事、那又何必秘密呢、至於心理、我認爲是人的問題、而不是整個事實問題、有不懂女生心理的男敎員、同樣也有不懂女生心理的女敎員、</p>
<p>（四）最理想的大衆運動</p>
<p>現今歐州各國、對於體育活動之評價、得了一個共同的、一致的答茶★、他倒在多年的研究結果、認爲最有益於身心、同時有敎育上、生理上、軍事上的價值的是游泳、所以我們所到幾個國家裏面如丹麥·德國勾牙利等國、都規字游泳爲各級學校必修課程、在一九三五年的冬季、德國敎育部並頒佈下列公令、「全國小學學生、必須學習游泳、不請游泳者、不得畢業」、德國是强迫敎育的國家、每一國民必須經過義務敎育的年限、所以計劃在十年後凡一九二五年度誕生的國民、是個個能游泳、白這個法令頒佈後、政府一方面加速的訓練大批游泳指導員、以應急需　丹麥也有同樣的規定、　他各國雖設有明文隨定、然而對於游泳的提倡、皆不遺餘力、瑞典的出篤克罕姆、政府指撥　量經費、訓練兒童游泳、故各國任何城市、不　大小、無不有游冰池之建築、同時有天然環境優良的地方、如海濱、湖濱等、當卽刻設立游泳池、我到過德國一個小城市呌馬堡、人口只有二萬人、大小游泳池就有四個、還有一個冬天溫水的、其實、游泳確是「種最理想的運動、同時又經濟、日常的消耗極微、而且還可以養成一種應付不測境遇的無能力、我希望國內各城市體育富局、敎育富局、也確實的來定一個十年計劃、規定一種適於國情的國民游戲、不管他是那一種運動、只要他是適合現代中國情形的需要的、土的也好、洋的也好、盡量的提倡、切實的執行、這樣的做去、我認爲是比花幾白萬塊錢、來開運動會實際得多了、十五年後、全國的靑年、我敢担保皆能在一種「新的典型」下、成爲眞正的新中國靑年、</p>
<p>（五）體操教材之轉變問題</p>
<p>（一）步伐的取消　本來這件事情、可以不必再提了、但是、又不得不提、只要少許能够想一想的人、都應該明瞭、上體育課的時候、是不是呌學生專門來一二一、開步走、或者是呌他們費許多精神來學習隊形的變化、這是極端違反體育原理的、本人在上海的時候、參觀過二决上海中小學運動會的團體操表演、使我最痛心的是、有白分之九十以上的學校、還是搬出那末一套隊形變化來、敎者學者都吃力得萬分、我希望敎隊形變化的同志們、我們平心靜氣的想一想、這種一二一、開步走的敎材、對於學生有沒有功效、有沒有影響、無疑的、誰都答不出來、那未、這種敎材就是極逞不能適用時，兒童是國家的生命、我們的責任是培養見童、我們决不能自誤誤人、遵誤無窮、這决我們參觀過好幾個學校的髒育課、從沒有看到什麽採用步伐的敎材、最通常的、在髒育課開始的時候、作準備活動、用的是跑步、跑步的種類不一、方法各同、可時快時慢或者調換方法、以免一陳不變而缺乏興趣、跑步完畢後、才開始各項運動、</p>
<p>（二）音樂的運用　體操與音樂確實有很大的相關性、特別在女生及中小學裏、因爲音樂的調和的節拍、抑揚的音調、以及悅耳的琴聲、都是以激發學生的興趣、减低運動時的疲勞、對於這一點、歐州方面、是已經盡量的利用了、</p>
<p>（六）青年訓練與童出軍</p>
<p>靑年訓練是歐州各國最重要的政策之一種、特別是意人大利和德國、全國的靑年、自幼以至成年、不論在智識精神上、思想上、體格上、都予以嚴格的保護嚴格的指導、使　到達成年的時候、巳經成爲一最完美的公民、在中國方面、我認爲這也是一種極重要的工作、目前中國最大的危機、也就是靑年體格的衰洛、智識的貧乏、中國現在要實行的時候，可以不必另起組織、而從現有中國實子軍加以改　、同時擴大範圍、不限定學生　能加入、凡兒童年齡在某一年度者、必須加入、關於這佃間題、預備最近期內、寫一篇比較詳細而具體的計劃、與各同志商討、</p>
<p>拉雜的寫來、思想既沒有組織、文字也不加以修改、况且以管窺豹、所見自不能及遠、國內諸先進、尚盼予以指正、此次歐遊、感想太多了、同時、每一個問題、都不是短時間所能講得完的、此後課餘有空的時候、再與諸同志慢慢的研究吧、（二十五年九月三十日柏林）</p>

<h3>統一的青年修養（上）</h3>
<p>— 應觀</p>
<p>（九月八日敎育廣播）</p>
<p>誰都覺察到現在中學生底學習担負太重了、學科已經忙不了、還要練習各種運動和體操、參加種種課外活動、勞動服務、大露營和大檢閱等、新花　還在日出不窮、差不多要把一個靑年弄得頭昏腦脹、力竭聲嘶而猶未已、這是時代敎育底需要、缺一樣是不行的、然而敎育底目的當眞是這樣的麽、</p>
<p>誰也不能否認現在的靑年是將來國家底主人、因爲我們這個民族遭遇了空前的厄運、所以我們决代國民對國家民族所負的歷史的使命、也就空前的艱巨、然而現在初中學生底年齡還不脫兒童時期、高中才是靑年初期、身心正當發育、都很脆弱，不堪繁重的工作、擔負艱巨的使命是以後的事、並非立刻可以擔負的、且正因爲將來責任的重大、目前對於他們身心發育上愛護更應當愈加周密、斷不能將前人和自已已經弄糟了的國事馬上整個向靑年身上推、好像先輩和自已欠下來的債立刻向未成年的子弟身上推、要呌他們立刻償還一樣、天下那里有這樣滑稽的事情</p>
<p>青年當此遺大投艱的時會、頭緒紛繁的　負中問、對於學問體格和品格底修養應該立定一個統的辦法、才能提綱挈領、扼要處理、不至窮於應付、疲於奔命、這統的修養辦法可以分一方面誰、第一是主管敎育　政機關一切負責領導靑年的織力機關、常常說地力敎育行政機關感覺中央對於靑年教育和訓練上各高級主管機關底政令常常電複抵觸、難以遵行、就我個人所知道的這種情形在中央各高級主管機關聞最近已於密切聯絡的辦法、極力避免政令上的重複矛盾、此後地方上負靑年敎育和訓練的各主管機關也可以商定確實有效的聯絡辦法、期於中央統一的政令可以貫澈到底、同時地方上各主管機關更不要冉有與中央法令抵觸的辦法、自然中央法令有時需要地方補充之處、但補充不能含有衡突的意思、總之、各主管機關應注意到靑年底總担負量、那就是每日工作底時間和普通靑年底精力該有多少、凡足以增加靑年學習担負的法令頒發之先、應考慮靑年底時間和精力能否担負、不能將靑年當作行政祖織上的縣長地位看待、各上級機關不論什麽事都是一紙空令仰該縣遵照辦理、該縣長活該萬死、若是一一奉行、也眞辦不了祗好一概不辦、來過乾脆靑年們沒有縣長們那些豐富的閱歷、懂得敷衍、你呌他做這樣那樣、他會當眞地去做、做的精疲力盡、身心俱　也　暇觀及了、</p>
<p>第二是學校行政構、學校是各級主管機關和靑年中間唯一重要的聯鎖、牠底地位可以使上級機關底政令　好或做壞、過去一般中等學校對於推行法令往往不力、多數學校保持着但求無過的態度、遇事敷衍搪賽，經這幾年整理的結果、這種現象適爲一正相反的　變、即一般學校都有點急於求功的趨勢、不管任何方面的命令都是不遲疑地立予運辦、至於各種辦法是否衝突、某神辦法是否無益有損辦的過　如何、結果如何、全無暇計及、要這樣才算是努力、才能面而討好、甚至還　刻意求了的學校、不從靑年基本訓練目運用切實的功夫、而從表面上想出零零碎碎五花八門的辦法驅使靑年活動、這樣呌外人看來、不但奉行法令堪稱得力、而且還有分外的成績、這是何等榮譽、可憐無辜的靑年被摧毀犧牲於這榮譽下的不知有多少、</p>
<p>上面所說的情形還是一部分想面面討好和刻意求工的學校所犯的毛病、現在再舉一個一般學校普通易犯的弊病來講、比如體育自然應當是强迫推行、要學生一致參加的、然而每個靑年底健康仍就應當顧到、如果身體有某種缺陷將應當免除某種運動或施以某種改正體操、又或臨時患某項疾病就應當暫時停止運動底全部或一部、這些都應當隨時密切注意、積極的鍛鍊是無可非議的、但預防流弊疏忽也是不能寬恕的、事實告訴我們、有不少的靑年因參加童軍檢閱、露營和雪中行車、事前事後、學校疏於防範、致患種種嚴重性疾病如腎臟炎·腥紅熱·急性肺炎等、又有不少的靑年已患心臟衰弱、肺結核等重症、而當局忽於覺察、仍令繼續參加軍訓、因致喪亡、在這種情形下敎練員和敎官自然難逃實任、而尤其應該責備的是學校行政人員和主持軍訓的負責人員、由於這决世運我國選手底慘敗、今後學校體育之必須加緊進行、自係勢所必然、同時各種危險和疾病底發生、也必日漸增加、怎樣預防和處置應爲今後學校行政方面所特別注重事項之一、不要對取得下屆世運的分數尚無把握、先自白白地犧牲若干在體育以外可以有爲的優秀靑年</p>
<p>總之、瞥明的中等學校校長和健全的學校行政機構對於上級機關底政令自然應該切實地推行、同時應仍不忘靑年敎育和靑年訓練底大的目標、運用自己的思考、期於推行盡利、把可能的弊病减全最低限度不敷衍　責、不汲汲求名、而積極地、思考地努力向前幹去、</p>
<p>第三是靑年自己、以上所講是就敎育和訓練靑年的各種主管機關和學校行政機構向言、因爲要達到統一的靑年修養不能小望各主管機關和學校先有統一的訓練辦法、雖是　外的文章、却也是本文底前　、以下纔講到靑年本身、可以說是統一的靑年修　底正文、也可以分三層來講（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花　傳新紗有解進　本月紗最後一幕　猛降六元</h3>
<p>紗市本且期爲最後一幕、多方堅决收貨、傳說在二百四十元外交割詎料價格過昂後、實需停滯、午後盤盤而下、末盤價喊進二百三十元關內、繼以多頭免爲支持、爲二百三十一元收盤、因市上盛傳有一千包雙鹿金塔兩牌新紗解進、尚有三星五十句係舊籌碼、因此市價驟形鬆懈、猛降六元、比上月之二百零一元七角、激漲二十九元三角、惟十一月期買方心意尚濃、</p>
<p>遠期均跳一元半</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤本月份爲最後一日營業、市勢平靜、某君準備收貨、頭盤微跌四角、十一月跌九角、十二月猛跌一元四角、遠期跌一角、二盤本月穩定、十一·十二月忽漲一元至二元半、遠月亦漲一元外、市塲多說靑島。天津兩處紗市高昂、該帮又來拖進標紗、市態轉挺、各月轉趨高翔、同時現紗售價復漲、迨至三收盤仍屬良好、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元五。六·八角、惟本月跌五角、午後聞盤、本月平澹無勁、惟遠月多方心意堅强、上漲·四角、二盤聞紗銷不暢、本月忽跌一元半、遠期平平、迨至三收盤、本月猛落三元、收盤再跌一元、因有新紗解進一千零五十包、遠月尚平、結果本月比上午收盤價猛跌五元半、遠勿動、賡豐晨買午賣、查賣出聚興一千六百五十包、錦昌二千一百包、慎記三千七百五十包、泰昌二千四百包、益昶九百五十包、興昌九百包、生源一千三百包、益記八百包、森康九百包、潤康七百五十包、同和一千包、買進望泰與三千五百包、恒益一千包長餘一千一百五十包長覺七千七百包、裕大六百五十包、同孚九百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>紗綫各漲一二元</p>
<p>現紗銷路仍平澹、查全日各帮買去統計六百四十五包、售價漲一元、綫漲二元、各帮買額如下、</p>

<h3>產地售價難鬆　棉商由空翻多　其如外棉比價接近何</h3>
<p>棉市堅定、被紗市帶起、兼之一般棉商、業已由空翻多、而產地之價未鬆、所以做多心思甚堅、然海外印美棉市步步下降、比價漸漸接近、故日廠巳有動辦之意、逢漲時拗賣者尚不乏人也、</p>
<p>標花近平遠漲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、十月期爲最後一幕空方雖大量交貨、然一般散戶棉商一律收貨、故市况復昂、漲三角、遠月隨之上升、二盤以後繼續良好、但海外棉市甚形疲乏、據棉商云、各路地頭售價難鬆也、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二角半至三四角、午後開盤、本月份平疲無勁、遠月尚昂、二盤以後、遠月忽跌二角、迨至三收盤又復回上、結果本月比上午收盤價跌三角、逮漲五分至一角、十月期有三萬擔套利、同業中收三萬擔、長豐晨賣午買、查賣出恒益三千四百擔、同和二千四百擔、明德二千九百擔、源大二千一百擔、興昌四千七百擔、長餘四千一百擔、慎記九千三百擔、泰昌八千七百擔、協成千五百擔、大昶四千擔、生源五千三百擔、新昶二千五百擔、潤康三千九百擔、買進裕大一萬二千擔、澄記一千九百、同孚二千擔、大豐四千擔、明德六千五百擔、合與二千二百　、　豐八千九百擔、森　二千六百擔、望泰興九千八百擔、益原六千五百擔、長和八千七百擔、仁豐四千五百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>棉花廠需停寂　現棉消費岑寂、廠胃閉塞、因印棉採算日見接近也、來源姚花三千二百包、通花　千八百十五包云</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布客帮交易减少　廠方交解花色貨仍極忙碌</h3>
<p>昨布市續疲、因實銷驟然呆頓、各貨漸有積貯、東貨雖無有貨、而本月底釗期照例須付欵墊出空棧單、故一部份多戶急求售晚、市盤因之下挫（每疋）一角左右、恰和廠粗布·粗斜一致跌價（每疋）一角至五角、計十六磅五福雙象粗布跌（每疋）四角、十四磅藍鷄單鹿跌（每疋）五角、十三磅九天飛熊三馬跌（每疋三角、十　磅三兔·三鹿、三貓跌（每疋）角、九磅五福貓鷹跌（每疋三角半、本廠粗布缺擋居多、十六磅鴻福寳星兩牌現售十一元一角、較上週四頂峯時亦回小（每疋）四角、花色貨錢呢·直貢·嗶嘰亦漸告挫跌（每碼）五厘至一分、印花絨因手貨廉售、續跌（每碼）一分之譜、各客帮鑒於貨價連挫、一致减少進貨、亟圖脫卸存貨、故新成交益形淸淡廠方交解白貨花色貨及坯布、工作仍極緊張云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麥價未鬆　粉市依然上漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平續漲之家、以洋麥報價、互有一二角之出入、故開價時人心尚平、本月份開價祗三元七角三分半、十一十二月份亦見平平、惟至一月份以下、因業外人心、鑒於存底不豐、各路糧價繼漲增高、買氣甚盛、故開價卽好一二分、旋則業中多頭回出、又復略疲、迨至下午開盤、本月份因月底交割又近、空頭籌碼逐步抵進、市氣轉堅、遠期各月份、因廠方套貨又寂、且現麥行市、迄未鬆、故人心繼見穩固、業中人推想、如果北路去化停頓、麥市勢必帶下、則粉市始能逐見和緩云、</p>
<h3>北地糧價步高　麥市愈覺</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份因洋麥雖互有一二角上落、惟以北地糧價、逐步騰躍、更以最近天氣、依然晴暢、業內外人心、不免均覺皇皇、是以各月份交易平穩之中、遂見俏利、較前週收價、計好一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、近期因交割關係、人心尚定、一月份以下、因客戶套貨甚少、且以麥底愈空、人心更覺堅勁、所以提振又烈、照此情形、非與洋麥接近、人心難望平落也、現麥市面、仍然穩定、高麥如沙河集瑤灣麥仍開六元、漢口細麥高爲五元七角、决至五元三角、統市計開一萬八九千包云、</p>
<h3>河米仍恃北方銷路</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源較前略稀、共到四十餘號、貨共八千餘石、本街銷塲仍懈、包胃平津胥烟等帮辦新薄稻近二千包、厚新粳一千餘包、及薄破一二百包、故厚新粳市况轉軟、跌落一角、窑種菜種高貨平定、中段者及百哥等則貶修五分、蘇同帮杜羊尖去路較佳、見秀近尺、共外各帮反形帶軟、厚簿破粳平平、新陰元仍以走化呆滯、又降角外、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源四五十號、市上去　本街淸淡、包胃續有去化、新粳羊尖早市喊起近尺、後市定局、破梗平疲、六種密種胃口不爽、價短角外、嘉善早　價小一二角、埠尖客尖杜尖價形挺立、陰變元亦見呆定、其餘各米較前相仿</p>
<h3>四平街荳定貨不少　黃荳市况為之不振</h3>
<p>東北大連四平街黃荳、已星期日正式訂開、由行家訂進二星期交五車、價爲五元六角二分、昨市續成交十一月內交五車、價爲五元五角七分、亦爲行家訂進、自東北荳開始運來、人心顯見虛弱、幸近日天時亢旱、市勢尚聚、但刻下大連荳交易正式開始、且市况續在報跌、故本埠市氣爲之大挫、昨榨油廠辦胃不動、祗有汕頭厦門福州及本街等問津、統市計開各荳二千八百餘包、行情高平次等、前進趨勢紛岐、暫不能有所捉摸云</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油現貨極俏</h3>
<p>白桐油自浙路見新以來、巳有旬日、惟來貨因上江水淺、中途極形滯緩致杭市現油竟吿中斷、價格前數日每砠尚售四十九元、旋因供不敷求、卽加五十元、近又增至五十二元均申交、且祗一二十砠可辦、尚須有到派着作數也、而各產地前售申之見新拋貨、泰半不能如期解　、致本埠油號均無現貨可售、存底之枯實屬罕見、漢市洋莊亦均注重期油、對於現油亦祗隨需隨辦、故偶有交易、均屬少數、價格在五十一二元之間洋規、期油已辦至一月份、價格在四十八九元、總數已有三四千噸交易、而各洋行在川湘兩省各產地所辦者、尚不在內也、</p>
<h3>證劵　在多空期下　債市略呈起伏</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、為十朋份期貨最後一天、市况完全在空雙方掉期下作被動、軋空軋多、雖無甚波濤、但亦頗有跡象可尋、丙種軋多始終如一、引因某金融界獨多、甲種獨軋空、日抬高特多、環境情形、斷難測度、市價亦難祈起色、今日祇做十一月份期貨一個月、亦頗有變化也、昨日經過、開盤市况卽見混沌、漲跌隨多空雙方掉期關係為升沉、如丁種本月軋高三角半、乙種本月份軋小二角、各個不同、次盤稍有吃戶、同時仍係多頭掉期、祇丁種近遠期相差過多、引起多方掉期、及一部份套利、顯近跌遠漲之象、餘的略好五分一角至四角不等、午後開盤、一致趨漲、甲種獨軋空、再好四角、餘尚平衡、收盤復趨混沌、高低互見、祇一角左右上第、市價結果、祇戊丙兩種、本月小一角、餘則一致上漲、以甲種本月漲六角爲最多、成交總數、共計一千零三十五萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>金融　金市絕為閑散　空方中途略有補進掉期升至二元七角</h3>
<p>金市初疲後堅中途因無入下手活動、情形極爲淸閑、空方有所補進、結果轉呈穩健而漲七角、晨初以海外銀市、英平美停、蒙得里遠期銀價亦未更動、滙兌開平而收略長、倫敦生金勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、標準標金掛牌仍爲一一五六元四角、塲外預備交易開出、雖退爲五十六元半、但成交則稀、萬興上塲買進、卽被拉上、升至七元外、晨開高盤、開後浮空趁勢活動、大戶亦略供給、塲內缺乏維持、卽告同跌、現貨號家趁低稍進、而有回升、匯豐銀行掛牌以及白銀平衡稅揭曉、均無變動、此後市况極爲閑散、缺乏動靜、盤旋至微、午刻亦然、趨勢尚現平和、後市形勢仍初疲後穩、大戶空方落手補進、賣方稀少、塲內難覓對手、遂漸拉上、印銀初升一安那、二次回小一安那、最後趨勢仍堅、掉期昨忽升至三元七角、今將一天市况誌後、</p>

<h3>南北貨汕頭橘餅又漲元許</h3>
<p>汕頭橋餅邇來到貨仍稀、查日前續釗十餘件、昨聞已開出、因值銷方均有需要、以致供不應求、市勢甚俏、故開價比前又升元許、據號方息、後批已辦成者亦僅十數件、市價不易回鬆云、</p>
<h3>糖市國產青糖實銷平淡</h3>

<h3>五金　青鉛價繼續昂騰</h3>
<p>靑鉛交易、邇來雖不見多、惟到貨甚少、兼之申市存底單薄、故執貨者心思奇好、昨市喊價比前又好五角、每担沽二十六元、交易四川帮及廠家方面均有點綴、聞開出二三百條、至機關上交易、近日則比較稍爲冷落云、</p>
<h3>狹條鐵現貨行將斷檔</h3>

<h3>二十年前之聯語</h3>
<p>— （胡君復）</p>
<p>民國剏建之始，海上人士對於庚子以援革命諸先烈，有盛大熱烈之追悼會，會塲設張園安塏地，歌哭之筆墨如雲。余爲聯語多則，其最長者二聯，其一云：誰不讀春秋，大義愧公等，認賊作父可乎？英雄靈魂，化身千萬億，血點點，淚點點，後有來者，前無古人，從歷刦九幽揮手鑒混沌。要使登袵席，革命溯文言，應天順民尚矣—世宙公例，莫問去來今，風瀟瀟，雨瀟瀟，先哲有知，自由不死，隨我祖黃帝騎龍上崑崙。又一聯云：維我祖誕降援，到今茲四千六百有九年，奠丕之基，造元元福，追論首功，良由降龍馴獅，拚赤血黑鐵抵種種事業代價。破庸流生死觀，歷浩刦億兆京垓無量數，現一一魂，獻一一身，徧滿大地，詎復嗟麟歎鳳，以英雄豪傑，爲某某特異名稱。雖語亦猶人，意氣之盛，乃不可一世，用長丈餘白綾書之，執筆者爲吾鄉書家李靖之先生，今亦謝世久矣。其較短一聯云：時勢造英雄，英雄造時勢。丈夫不怕死，怕死不丈夫。又亡友翁君佩孚聯云：雲雷方屯，公等蒙其難。天地爲闢，援來觀厥成。著筆不多，而下語如鑄，端凝如其人也。又亡友惲鐵樵一聯云：國巳無鳩，或猶首鼠兩端，噫！安有不流血能革命。誰復畏死，惟讓諸公一著，曰：是乃造時勢之英雄。語語峭拔，大似史論一則。無何而袁氏當國浸圖稱帝，禁網綦嚴，舉國惕息，吾時鬱鬱不自得，值里中公園有蘭花會之舉，吾爲題一聯云：入間何世？余情信芳。上下聯僅得八字，斯爲最短者。噫—舉國所萬萬不甘承認之賣國條約，袁氏亦於此時早植其禍根矣。</p>
<h3>跳繩考</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>跳繩這游戲，頗爲兒童們所愛玩。尤其是在氣候寒冷的當兒，不論家庭中，學校裏，小街之上，通衢之旁，常可看到那些兒童們三五成羣；口裏數着一，二，三，四，脚膀跳上跳下，在玩這游戲的。並且，玩這游戲，也比踢毽子來得簡單。踢毽子尚須人備一毽子。其無這工具的，往往因相羨相妬而引起相爭相奪的事情來：惟有玩這跳繩，只要隨便找到一根索兒，便可大家來樂一下子了。</p>
<p>跳繩屬跳躍運動。它不但能使足部肌肉發達，且能使全身血液流通。同時，它又可養成兒童整齊的習慣和記數的觀念。故這游劇和踢健子同是有益身體，而賢明的家長及小學敎師也不加禁阻。</p>
<p>跳繩與踢毽子同爲北方童戲，並且來源也很古。明人劉個于弈正所撰帝京物略曾引「楊柳兒死踢毽子」一句俗諺。帝京即今北平。這是說踢毽子的。至於跳繩，則北齊時已很盛行。北齊書後主紀：「童戲者，好以兩手持繩拂地而脚上跳，且唱日「高末」。按北齊一朝，起民國前一三六二年，終一三三五年。據此，則跳繩之戲，已有近一千四百年的歷史了。觀北齊書所載，那時跳繩的玩法也與今相同；且跳時口唱「高末」尤足見兒童心理好勝，古今如一。還有，且跳且唱，亦足以合節拍，而活躍之情亦如見。</p>
<p>跳繩來源之可考者如此。</p>
<h3>剪花樣</h3>
<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>剪花樣，是婦女職業之一種，伊們也可算是街頭藝術家；三寸金蓮，穿着繡花的鞋兒，六寸膚圓，也蹬着繡花的鞋兒；筆者最近訪問過兩個，「剪花樣」的女子，一個中年婦人，一個還是待字的少女，大姑娘有些羞人答答，我沒有和伊攀談，中年婦人，得到援面的一些材料：花鞋，每個婦女愛穿，可是沒有花樣，便不會空手繡成，矗立雲表的大厦，任它怎樣富麗矞皇，不是先要假手建築帥的圖案麼？鮮艷欲滴的花鞋，一片花樣，便等於建築師的圖案啊；內地城市的婦女，項愛好穿花鞋，其實都會裏雖然歐風吹來高跟革履，當伊們花燭之夕，還免不了一雙花鞋咧；上海小花園，不少女子鞋室，不是陳列着燦爛輝煌的對對花鞋麼？剪花樣的婦女們，不知鼻祖爲誰？可是代代相傳，不給外人學這種剪巧，伊們和向實業部註冊一般，是永遠專利；伊們帆船一艘，四海爲家，多半是江蘇興化泰縣籍，江南的常州，無錫，奔牛，丹陽，是伊們的殖民地；男子修理陽傘，煤油燈，女子剪花樣，不怕水災，旱災，不遭失業痛苦，大家靠雙手買飯吃，極盡夫唱婦隨」之樂；伊們老走江湖，眼睛裏看得多，耳朶裏聽得多，伊們陽傘一柄，包袱一個，我們聽到尖銳的「剪花樣啊」！這種呌喚，便是伊們和「貸郎担」一般的招徠主顧了；陽傘一柄，可以抗日遮雨，包袱一個，不啻「萬有文庫」，也就是樣子間的縮影；編輯先生，剪刀漿糊，伊們剪刀白紙，伊們雖然粗手黑皮，你給伊一個式子，準會不爽毫厘的剪出來，她們碰到將出嫁的閨女，便是唯一大主顧；「兔兒望月」，「交頸鴛鴦」，「荷花蓮子」，「蝴蝶穿花」，都是拿手傑作；她們生意巧的時侯，一天可以撈摸五六毛錢，多半兩人一組，路遇第三第四的同道，收入大家平分；伊們知道同舟共濟！互助！是神聖的規律。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>友梅道：因為在這夏天沒有蘭花的時候，還陳設着與蘭花同名的東西。真有了蘭花，豈能夠不喜歡嗎？國器微笑着點了兩點頭，只說請坐請坐。友梅隨身在齊桌邊的藤椅上坐着，偶然回頭，見磁盆子裏供着一塊假山石，很是玲瓏剔透，上面的靑笞，總有半寸長，細小的樹秧，蒙茸的細草，配了小小的人物，頗也有趣。正這樣注意着，却看到山石盆子邊，另有個四方蒲草盆子，在盆子下面壓住一封信。那信封是陰白色的厚殼洋式的。在信封的對口所在，有一朶堆起來的玫瑰花。因爲這信是將反面朝上的，並沒有什麽字跡。但這信封却是在夢蘭　書桌看見過的。據他說，這種信封，現時　京沒有，還是由上海帶來的。難道這樣的巧，彼此全在上海帶來的嗎？心裏這樣的想着，但自己立刻警悟起來，參觀人家的屋子，怎好去倫看人家的秘密，因之順於就把那石膏的女神，拿在手上看，笑道：這屋子裏很古雅的，加上這樣一個人像却是太時髦了，同這些陳設不調和。國器在遠處藤椅子上坐下了，笑道：好些個朝友，看到這東四，全這樣的說。我也是每逢人就解釋着。這是西方一種古老的神話。這女像是愛情之神，可是不幸得很，被惡運之神壓迫，失了自由。他的名字呌維納絲。我因爲他的命運很苦，倒有些詩味，所以常把他擺在桌上，助理我的文思。友梅道：原來如此，表哥爲什麽不把自由之神的像擺在桌上呢。國器笑道：你以爲這現時的中國，可以談得上什麽自由嗎，友梅聽到這話，放下了石膏神像，對國器的瞼色看了一看。覺得他的臉上，在這一刹那間，加上了一層幽鬱之氣。（九〇）</p>
<h3>民間戲劇</h3>
<p>— 吳毓雋</p>
<p>美國好萊塢的拍拉蒙公司，到我國來拍「大地」外景，他們所到的地方，却是我們許多自命高貴身份的紳士型人們所不卹到不願到的那些地方—就像北平的天橋，天津的三不管等處—而「大地」所採集的材料，又是專從那種「下三柵」的玩意兒去尋找，到很可以說是「深入民間」去了。</p>
<p>許多關心「大地」來華攝片的人們，認爲拍拉蒙是不懷好意，所以專從下作區處着眼—像女子的小脚，男子的辮子之類，要求政府應該去監督他們的取材和剪接。</p>
<p>我們現在別管拍拉蒙公司攝「大地」是否原意來恥辱我們的國風，其實，就像那種民間的娛樂，民間的戲劇，一切民間俚俗的傳統習慣，歷史上的遺跡，在在有得發現，的確可以望風問俗，有供研究的價值，國製電影公司不是正在鬧劇本荒嗎？爲什麼計不出此，反被外人來捷足先得了去呢！</p>
<p>所以，我以爲用民間文學作題材，作背景，來愆成一部譏諷時代的劇本，這是怎樣有意義，有滋味呢！藝華影業公司最新由黃嘉謨岳楓編導的一部有隊新片「喜臨門」，卽取材于民間風俗而包含幽默，諷刺，滑稽等情節，攻擊專制婚姻尤不遺餘力，這天幾「喜臨門」正在本埠新光戲院放映，看了包呌你捧腹在笑，要說劇作者的造意爲新奇的，主角周璇姑娘，更有深刻的表演與貢獻。</p>
<p>短訊　自滬京報界發表宜言，以「中日關係緊張中吾人之共同意見與信念」一文披露後，各省市報界公會，記者公會，亦相率響應，發抒意見，上海「國際文學編審館」，鑒於該各項宣言，頗有傳誦之價值，因廣事蒐集，編纂成　，內除宜言外，附錄社論及日本報界評文數則，總計三萬餘言，印刷精美，裝訂新穎，現聞該館除分發全國圖書館外，並爲普遍贈送起見，凡附郵票十分，寄「上海克能海路一三四弄七號」該館，當卽寄奉一册，以供參考云。（吉字）</p>
<h3>蹦蹦新話</h3>
<p>— 黃南丁</p>
<p>自從蹦蹦劇到了上海，一逕到現在，每一家遊戲場中，都有了蹦蹦戲的點綴，已到了極盛的時期。在這幾年以內，到上海來的蹦蹦戲班，也有了不少。卽以現時在上海出演的而論，大新游樂塲，喜彩蓮，新新花園芙蓉花，先施樂園，張彩蘭，大世界—朱寳霞，恩派亞電影院，白玉霜，其外還有鈺靈芝，鄉靈芝，愛蓮君，小白玉霜等，但是在上海地方，開蹦蹦戲紀錄的是朱寶霞，現在最受人歡迎的，也是朱寶霞，因自朱寳霞到上海，在新世界飯店開演之後，上海人方始注意了蹦蹦戲。近時各游藝塲的蹦蹦戲，生意最好的，便是大世界，差不多每天都是客滿。所以蹦蹦戲在上海，最受歡迎而值得稱贊的，便是朱寳霞的一班，尤其是寳霞同她妹妹紫霞兩人。</p>
<p>無論是什麽種類的戲劇，倘只守着幾齣原有的劇本，不騙排新戲，决不能有持久性，尤其是蹦蹦戲，原有的劇本，都是粗俗而簡陋，雖是也有幾齣較佳的劇本，如桃花庵，杜十娘，李香蓮賣畫等，不編排新的蹦蹦，便不能引起觀衆的興緻。但是編排新戲，並不是容易的事情，非有編戲經騐，好的敎師，好的材料不可。蹦蹦戲在長久的時期下，並沒有人注意過，要有這種人材，當然很是難得的一事。現在朱寳霞，却得了平劇名敎師關鴻賓的導編，因此伊所出演的新戲，不是尋常的蹦蹦新戲所能比較。</p>
<p>在朱寳霞新戲裏面，最好的一本，便是「狐狸緣」。以前朱也曾上演過新戲，如血淚碑，賽金花，玉堂春，但是都沒有「狐狸緣」來得劇情趣妙，塲面緊凑。因「狐狸緣」劇本，很合於戲劇的條件。有大段唱工，有細膩的表情，所有配角，都能克盡厥職，尤其是朱紫霞，有悲有樂，可以使寳霞有紅花綠葉的收效。而且賣霞，在劇本內，有大段的二簧唱工，腔調旣逼肖了陳硯秋，嗓音又響遏行雲，可裂金石，使全劇生色不少。所以道本「狐狸緣」新戲，自開演以來，口碑載道，朱寳霞的藝術成功，越發有了鞏固的地位。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>上海之蟲</h3>
<p>— 太上</p>
<p>上海這地方，眞正奇妙而矛盾得不可思議，可以說什麼都有，也可以說什麼都沒有！</p>
<p>上海是祗有消費而沒有生產的，偌大的都市，竟尋不着一件道地土產的出品，除了那些紈褲子弟，妖媚婦人，和市井巨猾？甚至，尋常日用必需之物，柴米油鹽魚蝦蔬菜之類，都不能不仰給　別處的輸入。然而，天下的財貨，聚藏於上海，因此，各地的特產，也都彙集於此。自古道，「錢可通神」，祇要有錢，除非龍的肝，鳳的髓，蚊子的骨頭，不是人世間所能有的，其餘任何奇異名貴的物品，上海都應有盡有。便是一切珍禽猛獸，以及冰山雪海間的怪物，如虎豹犀兕，獅象熊羆，猩猩袋鼠，海豹鱖魚等等，中土所罕見而難得的，也自有人不避艱辛，遠道運送到動物院遊戲場中陳列着，還有海京伯馬戲班之流亞，浩浩蕩蕩，從幾萬里外，飄洋泛海而來，表演給我們看，這就好在「大爺有的是錢」！</p>
<p>不過，金錢的勢力，有時而窮，儘有許多極細微極平常的東西，竟爲上海所稀有而不易見到的，試猜究竟是什麽珍物呢，哈哈，那便是渺乎其小的「蟲」！</p>
<p>原來，「木朽而後蟲生」，昆蟲大都生長在卑濕污穢之地，潛匿在森林蔓草之間，上海却多的是暴發富人，「樓高樹小盡不古」，又規定年限，必需翻造，不許有斷瓦頹垣的古舊建築存在；其次，多數的居民，都是「圭寶」「　　」式的衖堂房子，舉頭看不見一片樹葉兒，低頭也覓不着一株青草，試問蟲類從何有孪生蕃殖之所，何况衛生當局，三令五申，注重清潔，備齊新業利器，嚴厲掃除，愈加使得它們「靡有孑遺」，「不遑寗處」了。於是物稀為貴，像賈丞相半間堂內的蟋蟀，大觀園中賈環先生的蟈蟈兒，噤口立於廊廟殘聲曳國別枝的寒蟬，在上海，也居然珍貴得好比遼東的白豕，千里昭昭的稗販而來，要「待善價而沽」呢！</p>
<p>內地多害蟲，尤其是夏天的蚊子，喧鬧如雷，替膚吮血，儼然是人類的公敵。西湖，可稱消夏勝地，也就苦的是蚊子又多又大，雖不至像笑林廣記所說「朝抵燕子磯，蚊子大如鷄，暑宿巫山峽，蚊子大於鴨」，（？）却也比「露筋祠」畔差不了多少，所以，劉莊等處，　湖的房子，都裝設着專門禦蚊的碧紗櫥。上海本來就不大有蚊子，租界的繁盛區域，附近沒有草地和「死水」，可以整個的夏大，用不着蚊帳，這是內地所萬萬辦不到的。</p>
<p>我在上海住了近二十年，認爲祗有這是上海唯一的優點，但在大華飯店（？）看露大電影時，這話應該作廢！</p>

<h3>細菌戰爭之研究（下）</h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>—在世界大戰襲擊之前夜特寫</p>
<p>「瘟疫」是細菌戰爭實踐結果的一個總名稱，它包括了各種傳染病，每一傳染病是瘟疫的一個分子，各個分子聯　起來才構成了瘟疫病，所以中國人對於傳染病不能明暸，一遇了傳染病總是以「瘟疫」名稱表示，但某一種傳染病，有某一種症候與症狀（此地省略了，請參考專書）關於治療方面在細菌戰上，無甚緊要，和普通治療一樣，特殊的一點就是撲滅細菌是唯一的南針，最重要者，還是非在預防上着手不可，乃最有價値的事，有意義細菌戰爭防禦的方法，確實能實收效騐的，有二條原則可走：（一）是國家方面擔負的責任，因為敵人用細菌戰攻擊於我，全國之士均受其害，不是某一省或一地方所能防禦成功，必定要全車都有防御的設備，建筑的工程，庶可不受敵人的威　，充實武力以捍衛國十的完整。（二）是訓練全國的民衆　對於細菌戰有相常的認識，防疫的。常識組織防疫隊從事防疫，以協助國家，增强防範工作。</p>
<p>在個人方面防禦的實際，養成「起居」「作息」飲食「整潔」鍜鍊衛生事項，骨骼如何衛生，肌肉如何衛生？消化，循環，呼吸，排洩，感覺人體各系統如何衛生，使全國民衆獲得個人衛生的方法，達到身體健康的境域，國民體魄健康，民族精神振作，就可以抵抗疾病和細菌侵襲了。</p>
<p>欲保障全國人民財產安全，人類的幸福，避免細菌戰的危害，團體的預防是唯一有效的辦法，在上面已經說過，現在羅列於下：</p>
<p>（一）海港檢疫和交通衛生管理：霍亂病又呌做「虎烈拉」，中國本無此病，是由印度傳播來的，甲地傳播到乙地，完全由於交通為媒介，現在科學昌明，交通繁達，傳播機會更多，所以交通衛生管理與海口檢疫，在防止瘟疫上是很重要的，在通商出入處，檢查行旅，如發現有疾病或帶菌者的嫌疑，就不得自由行動，必予以隔離，可以使甲地的瘟疫不能傳染至乙地流行，這種妨碍工作，是不能缺少的一種設備。</p>
<p>（二）免疫測騐與預防注射：有許多疾患，可以在早期從事預防而能避免的，如霍亂，傷寒，白喉，破傷風，狂犬病，猩紅熱，腦膜炎……等，早期預防注射，很有减少疾病發生和死亡率低落的趨勢，但我們還有其他許多的疾病，是否有抵抗能力？我們是不得而知，所以必得大規模舉行免疫測騐，庶可以知道某人對於某疾病能發生抵抗，或缺乏抵抗力頗易感染，那就注射抗體以增其免疫力，使全國國民都能抵抗病毒的傳染。</p>
<p>（三）撲滅鼠蠅蚊蟲臭蟲等：有許多瘟疫病的來源，完全由於某種寄生蟲做媒介的，如臭蟲是斑疹傷寒，回歸熱等病的媒介，蠅是霍亂，傷寒，赤痢的媒介，蚊是瘧疾，黃熱病，鼠蚤是鼠疫重要的媒介物，所以全國一致起來，撲滅這些寄生蟲為是。</p>
<p>（四）糞便與溝渠的管理：糞便，溝渠，都是骯髒物的所在地，是傳染病的源泉，疫癘的產生地，中國對於糞便溝渠的設備和管理，向來不重視的，所以死亡率的高超，不無因此很有關係，那末厠所的改良糞便處置，與下水道的建設，可不能再延遲，對於國家之生存為攸關哩！</p>
<p>其他尙有幾種檢查工作，是必定要舉行，與人民日常的生活有關，列在下面：</p>
<p>（一）水之檢查　衛生最注意的是飲料，水與人關係最密切，若不注意衛生，則易生傳染病，故水均須隨時檢查，凡水之味，色，成分……等必須經過嚴密之檢查，方能適用，如不能應用，卽時應取締之，若以顯微鏡檢查，一克水中，舍有一百五十個細菌以上，絕不可飲用。</p>
<p>（二）食物之檢查　人類每日能營養體質，補充體力，調和體溫，均依賴食物之力量，飲食在生活環境，必不能缺乏於頃刻間，食物即如此重要，必得從事檢查，是否腐壞病菌寄生於上，營養價廉如何？消化程度如何？是與人類生活有嚴重的關係。</p>
<p>（三）空氣之測騐　空氣與人生，是不可有一分之差，在須臾間，呼吸不能充分供量，人立刻就可由窒息而至死亡，故必得檢查空氣是否新鮮？是否含有毒質？是否有病菌寄生？誠為吾人之所不可忽視的。</p>
<p>關於瘟疫傳染後之消毒，略誌於下：</p>
<p>（一）患者——傳染病者，經治愈時，須全身入浴，更換衣服，不得已者，以溫濕布拭净，以代入浴。</p>
<p>（二）死體——傳染病體，最好舉行火葬之，如不能，在殮棺之時，將昇汞水或石炭水，撒布或浸潰被服，再以石灰貯塞。</p>
<p>（三）搬運患者覽死體——搬運傳染病患者或死體之繩槓臥具，每次必須以昇汞水或石炭酸水擦拭。</p>
<p>（四）廁所溝渠——凡患傳染病之吐瀉物，排洩物，必須經過消毒，如用糞灌漑肥料，必須消毒經一星期後，方可作為肥料，溝渠之土地，當灌以石灰乳消毒之。</p>
<p>（五）住戶房屋——患傳染病者之住戶房屋，內部宜用石炭酸水或昇汞水拭净，再以日光射入，使其乾燥。</p>
<p>（六）衣服器具——患傳染病者，所用之衣服臥具，均用綠石鹼洗净或石炭酸水拭净。</p>
<p>（七）汽車船舶——平常以石炭酸水撒佈，如發生傳染病者之吐瀉物，排洩物，再行以消毒之。</p>
<p>我們就上面看來，毒瓦斯戰爭尙不可畏，細菌戰爭倒是慘無人道一種戰爭，但現今世界，良心已沒，公理不彰，所以我們對於細菌戰爭之研究，不能再忽略了它，細菌戰的防禦和建設，應為救國策略中最重要一種國策，以防事態於萬一，但吾人也不能過分的怕懼，戰戰兢兢，總之細菌戰爭實踐起來很不容易，細菌戰爭總有一天實踐起來，我們唯一的認識，就是趕緊準備着吧！「充實武力以保障國家士地的完整，謀世界人類的和平，」是我們當前的急圖！</p>
<h3>蘇聯醫界高級神經活動的研究</h3>
<p>— 濤聲寄自莫斯哥</p>
<p>全蘇聯實騐醫學學院高級神經活動組的研究工作，包含着一切神經活動的問題，從胚胎組織初期起直至以有條件反應的形態，表現動物適應外界環境的方法為止，都廣羅無遺，其研究工作的基本問題係諸與周圍活動影響有關係的神經活動組織，簡言之，這問題涉及中樞及周圍神經活動，因此該研究組共設有四個試騐室，胚胎遺傳試騐室，實騐神經學試騐室，有條件反應試騐室及形態學試騐室。</p>
<p>該研究組第一部工作的基本問題，胚胎生命初期所形成的神經中樞，受周圍器官的影響　到若何程度，這問題實有特殊的意義，因為以前關於神經中樞的研究，都認為凡在生產前，一切與神經系統有關係的組成物，皆係極少有改變的組織，此說尤以對於中樞神經系統各部為甚。</p>
<p>試騐的舉行係按下列程序</p>
<p>在胚胎發育初期時，割開受孕動物的腹壁及子宮，對於胚胎施行腦部割口術，分離腦的各部，其後，縫合子宮及腹壁而令受孕動物繼續其懷孕生活，自施行手術後，胚胎達其生產時約須三十至四十日，此類胚胎於生產時對於外界環境的第一次活動是極堪注意的事，</p>
<p>手術的施行若在最初期，於大多數例中，初生動物的一般活動，其發展有條件反應的能力，亦卽適應外界環境的能力皆極正常，</p>
<p>手術的施行若在子宮間生命的後期，於大多例中，初生動物於生產時卽有顯著的缺點，亦甚難以適應其環境，例如，有些動物喪失向前活動的能力，僅能倒退，另有些動物僅能站立在一處，上下跳躍，還有些僅向一方向繼續不斷地旋轉活動。</p>
<p>此類初生動物，也常有喪失尋母本能的，但同時在其他方面却不顯有任何缺點，此類初生動物可滯留於其母身旁數小時而不覺，或試求哺乳，這種複雜本能的喪失是該動物一般官能能力改變的肯定徵象，但，若助以長期良好的看護，仍有完全返回常態的可能。</p>
<p>尙有一件可注意的事，卽手術的施行雖在早期，初生動物的表現又極正常，用顯微鏡檢查其腦葉，却常見有不正常的分佈。</p>
<p>蘇聯實騐醫學學院高級神經活動研究組曾施行過五十次這類手術，大多數皆係研究生產後的情形。</p>
<p>周圍器官的作用</p>
<p>關於周圍器官的作用，其試騐結論如下，中樞神經系統很早就受周圍器官衝動的影饗，因此，在這期間中樞神經系統的組織變化，雖各器官尙未構成其本身的神經系統，亦可由周圍器官緩慢的衝動補償，簡言之，周圍器官衝動到神經中樞，可使已有變化的中樞神經系統，構成為一種常能的官能關係，這就是周圍器官為神經組織主要建築者的歷史作用，</p>
<p>所以這試騐又支持了神經活動研究組的基本觀點。</p>
<p>該組的第二部工作是關於神經中樞在試騐上的改變。</p>
<p>這項工作的主要方法在連接周圍器官與神經中樞，却不使周圍器官屬於神經中樞，這類工作的完成係由於連接神經幹綫，例如迷走神經素為供喉，心及腸用的神經，以之連接一素供肢體用的神經，則其與中樞神經系統的正常關係因而受了阻碍，於是，前腿的任何刺激，肌肉的每次伸縮，都被傳達到中樞神經系統的另一部分，這種連接的結果能使中樞神經系統感到紊亂，例如，狗對於搔腿而有咳嗽反應，肌肉伸展時的急響可促成歷時甚久，倔强的嘔吐表現，這些現象都能引起科學家們的特殊興趣，長期觀察這些現象及其演變可以幫助吾人瞭解某些神經中樞的恒久不變，</p>
<p>各神經中樞的研究</p>
<p>此外動物的反應常隨神經中樞一切狀况而畏，如動物的腿隨着呼吸而開始</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>呼吸，或隨吞食而表現一切食時的複雜行動等，這樣吾人始可研究各神經中樞的特質。</p>
<p>該組更進一步研究，以試各種不同的刺激，尤注意有深刻生理學上意義的刺激，乃轉輸眼的刺激至與上述相同的神經中樞，因此縫合迷走神經與視神經及眼部感覺神經，結果，在四個月內，凡用紙片輕微接觸眼部的角膜皆激起强烈的咳嗽，而終至於嘔吐，於是，我們可以看到皮膚及角膜受刺激，有如該項刺激直達迷走神經中樞一樣。</p>
<p>尙有一個接受刺激更有敏感的表面，卽粘膜。</p>
<p>試騐由粘膜所傳來刺激，常選用舌的表面，因此，縫合迷走神經與一切舌神經，以便轉輸舌所受刺激達迷走神經中樞，而不達其原來的神經中樞，結果，又為激起咳嗽及嘔吐，與上述各試騐現象相同。</p>
<p>此種類似的試騐甚多，皆不一而同。</p>
<p>這種歷數年時間的觀察實甚重要，從試騐中吾人看到一些神經中樞的固定，及另一些神經中樞的易於變動，在一些例子中，周圍的衝動附屬於神經中樞，以再建其工作，另一些例子，却是相反神經中樞常强固器官（肌肉）隨其本身意志工作，歷時甚久。</p>
<p>這些試騐曾在數百動物身上做過，使吾人可歸納得一結論，關於因見於某數種特殊神經中樞的不變特質，而歸納謂為神經中樞不變的一般假定是錯悮的。</p>
<p>此項試騐的主要特點在神經中樞的改變，有時並可能地預先吿訴在官能中樞將有何種變遷，</p>
<p>該組的第三部分工作係高級神經活動的研究，其所用的研究方法又甚特殊，查研究方法有二，其一為巴潑洛夫氏有條件反應的方法，此種方法對於成立腦活動的理論頗多重要成就此外尙有一研究週身行動之方法，如美國行為學派的方法，該組的研完方法係將上述兩種方法連合而成為一種新方法，用巴氏方法試騐狗時，任狗自由行動，則狗受有條件刺激後，除分泌唾涎外，尙左右尋覓，似欲尋找刺激的來源，於是試騐者同時尙注意受試騐動物的行動，旣可詳究根據巴氏的有條件反應，亦可細查狗的行動，</p>
<p>這種研究方法使用的結果，使吾人可以對於動物神經的研究得到一個試廣汎的範圍，根據這種方法研究，已有二十餘篇科學報吿，其前途的發展正未可限量，</p>
<h3>再談輸血問題</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>自余發表「輸血問題一文於本刋以後，未數日而某律師對於本問題之補請律師公會轉部解釋聲請理由書復揭載於本報。余本不願再有所論列，顧以茲事體大，關係於醫學與醫業及社會聽聞至鉅，乃草此以難之。</p>
<p>某律師曰：「按刑法第二十二條，規定業務上之正當行為不罰。」所謂正當行為者，以醫業言，係就病者，本身於必要時施行一種正當之手術……輸血乃因救濟一人，一面又傷害一人，……自不得以正當行為論。」</p>
<p>難曰：「輸血之是否為正當行為，應視輸血是否能致傷害而定，至是否能致傷害，則非空言所能斷，必有醫學及臨床之證明，大抵普通健壯者之血，有五六公升之多，而抽取一次，僅為百餘公撮之微，九牛而拔一毛，於輸血者之健康固無所損，且以臨床經騐言之，被抽者之血液，則因屢次抽取之故而生產愈速，補充愈易，故輸血一事，實為以有餘補不足之科學療法，根本卽無傷害之可言，夫截甲肢以補乙，劓丙鼻以與丁，此誠為傷害行為，不可與輸血同日而語。然則旣非傷害，則自為正當行為，無疑在不罰之列」。</p>
<p>某律師曰：「刑法認定犯罪程度，係就着手實施時之結果而認之，至於以後能否復原，則非法律之所問一。</p>
<p>難曰：某律師之為是語，係對余前文「被抽血者稍事休養卽可復原」一語而發也，夫刑法所謂認定犯罪程度，就着手實施時之結果而認定之者，係指明知結果不良而着手施行者言之也。至於輸血一事，醫師明知必不至傷害而抽血，亦明知必可收救濟之效而輸血。着手施行之際，卽豫知有益無損，何得謂之犯法。信如某律師所言，直認輸血為犯罪行為，則醫家為法律所束縛，雖慈父，孝子，仁弟，至戚，宗敎家，愛國者之請求，亦祗得却步搖手深拒而固絕之，何者，不能同意於自願傷害也。是使孝者坐視至親之死亡，仁者空懷犧牲之熱血，而陷醫家於忍人也。（完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>

<p>（九十四）慢性關節風濕痺</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做　慢性關節風濕痺？</p>
<p>（答）這和急性關節風濕痺（參閱五十九）一樣，也是一種多發性關節炎，可是經過很慢。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣發生本病？</p>
<p>（答）有些是續發於急性多發性關節炎的，也有原來就成慢性而潛伏的進行的，更有因他種疾病而發的。就是梅毒性慢性關節炎，淋疾性慢性關節炎，或結核性慢性關節炎等。</p>
<p>（問）這種慢性關節風濕痺，和性別有沒有關係？</p>
<p>（答）婦人容易發生。</p>
<p>（問）小兒有沒有發生？</p>
<p>（答）很少。但小兒發生的對稱的關節腫脹，同時淋巴腺和脾臟都腫脹，却是一種危險的敗血病，特稱為司替爾氏病（Still＇s　disease）。</p>
<p>（問）慢性關節風濕痺，病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）主要的是侵犯小關節，關節在運動或壓迫的時候起疼痛：早起時有關節强直的感覺。若勉强動搖他，起爆聽或軋音。這種疼痛和强直，跟天氣有關係，在霉雨季節就會增惡。</p>
<p>（問）患慢性關節風濕痺的關節，外觀上有沒有異狀？</p>

<p>（答）單純泉水，或炭酸泉，硫黃泉等都可。若這有效力，那末行溫河浴，銧溫泉等療法</p>
<h3>眼耳鼻喉疾病衛生常識（一零四）嗅覺</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>我們的鼻腔。一般具有三個作用。就是呼吸嗅覺及輔助言語的構成。所以鼻腔或全身，如果一旦發生疾病。那就這三個作用。卽可先後引起影饗或障碍。現在姑就嗅覺一項。略為一說。</p>
<p>人類嗅覺器官的機能。比較其他五官器的機能。則稍形微弱。蓋已陷於退化的狀態。所以我們的嗅覺。並不十分銳敏。反之。譬如哺乳動物若犬，貓，及鼠等。則它們的嗅覺。特別發達。所以犬能探索它的尿跡而知途徑。更若驚犬竟可訓練帮助警員。搜查盜賊的蹤跡。這等事實和成功。無非都是利用它的銳敏嗅覺所致。言歸本文。講到人類鼻腔粘膜的嗅覺部。、就是存在於上甲介與中甲介部分的粘膜及與此兩部相對的鼻中隔粘膜。在這種粘膜上面。分佈一種嗅細胞。倘若外界的嗅素。一旦流入鼻腔。侵及粘膜。則此嗅素卽可刺戟嗅細胞而發臭覺。嗅覺的强弱。可用司華特馬克氏所發明的嗅覺計來檢查。方可决定嗅覺力的大小。一般在醫學上，對於嗅覺的異常。總稱之曰，嗅覺障碍。嗅覺障碍主要的有四。卽（一）嗅覺過敏，（二）嗅覺减退，（三）嗅覺脫失，及嗅覺錯亂。</p>
<p>（一）嗅覺過敏—就是嗅覺比較平常的强度為强。常發於歇司的里，神經衰弱，月經，及妊娠等時。</p>
<p>（二）嗅覺减退—就是嗅覺比較平常的强度為弱。</p>
<p>（三）嗅覺脫失—就是嗅覺業巳變為麻痺。以上二種嗅覺障碍發牛的原因。可以別為中心性，呼吸性，及眞正性的三種。原因為中心性者。常發於腦疾患。原因為呼吸性者。常發於鼻疾患，上氣道疾患及肺部疾患。原因為眞正性者。常發於嗅神經的異狀。</p>
<p>（四）嗅覺錯亂—有二種。一種是誤認含有某種嗅素的嗅覺。而為他種臭素的嗅覺。譬如臭香氣而意為酸味。或竟意為不快的惡嗅。此稱之曰異樣嗅覺。一種是並無嗅素的存在。而竟戚覺某種的臭氣。此稱之日嗅覺幻覺。此等嗅覺錯亂多見於歇司的里，神經衰弱，潛伏性副鼻腔炎，異物，及惡性腫瘍等時。</p>
<p>若患嗅覺障碍者。應卽探索原因病。而加以治療。否則常難奏效。</p>
<h3>述李克加及李克加病（五）</h3>
<p>— 陳端白</p>
<p>在斑疹初此推出時，全身症狀隨之加劇，呼吸亦隨之困難，神志忽爾糢糊，手足時時牽動，囈語雜作，脈搏速度劇增，大便秘結，小便則赤暗，轉歸惡劣時，則在第二週末期，病者在昏進中，或因心臟麻痺而喪其生命，熱度的退落，通常是在二週以後的為猝降性，Urtsich　二三日內忽由四十度而降至平常體溫，降前降後，或忽設一度高漲，亦屬常見的事實，這時病入疲乏思睡，醒後則神智淸朗，大有大夢初覺之狀，恢復期比較甚短，合併症以肺炎為最可慮，回時的懷死也足懼，此症的死亡率可說頗高，但也跟流行季節氣候而不同，普通我們定他為百分之二十，患者年齡過三十的預後較為危險。</p>
<p>（八）診斷</p>
<p>病理組織檢查有特殊的血管壁壞死的事實，血淸檢查，則為習做的丸爾勿烈，Weie-Felix之Prosenx　×　i9的Agglufination血淸凝集反應，普通　i;　100己稱陽性也有高至　i;　10000及　i;　20000者，這個反應在第六日後，幾乎是百試百應，無一或爽，可是它的原理，至今還沒有滿意的說明呢，發疹傷寒跟腸窒扶斯的鑑別，在病狀願明時，當然毫無疑問，斑點就可以解决這個難題，其它如全身症狀，則腸窒扶斯患者現陰沉寗靜的態度，發疹傷寒反之為神志不寗，臨床家可一望而知，最精細的分別，當然是血淸反應，這是不會欺騙的不開口朋友。</p>
<p>（九）治療及預防</p>
<p>發疹傷寒及其他李克加病的治療，因為還沒有找到一件絕對有效的藥物血淸治療，也在試騐期中，所以一切祗是對象療法，如强心，安神，去毒，利便，以及室內空氣的流通，飲食的照顧早期內試用金屬製劑，似不無良效，總刮的說治療方針，着重在血行機關的保護，與合併症發生的避免。</p>
<p>預防的方法，免疫學應用方法，現在當談不到，所能做到的，是居處的淸潔，蝨類的撲滅，這個病是跟蟲類有連帶關係的，所以患此病者大都屬於住處衛生不講究，或無力講求的朋友，窮苦的圖存者，所以歐洲的李克加活躍地，是束歐小國波蘭俄羅斯，共它生活講究的國家，雖然比較少，但是他們在默洲苦戰中，也當到了不少敎訓，我們！我們這個國家是如何呢，應該如何呢，還是先要知道何處流行何處存在呢？。</p>
<h3>浙江硤石衛生狀况調查報告（六）</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>（戊）結論</p>
<p>本篇雖僅屬硤石衛生情况，我們若來向國內各地擴觀一下，就知其內容一部分可作中國衛生的代表，因國內各地衛生狀况大都如此黯淡，由是我們益知中國衛生的幼稚，怪不得要給外人譏為東亞病夫了。然則我們應如何努力奮起直追，那末國家强盛可期，民族復興有望！否則不久的未來怕世界輿圖上就沒有我大中華的彩色了。</p>
<p>茲以觀察後印象及改進意見再分述於後：</p>
<p>（A）推廣衛生教育：</p>
<p>（一）各校中每週至少宜加增衛生教育兩小時，聘請專家擔任講演，以養成兒童衛生習慣為目的。</p>
<p>（二）文化機關應組通俗衛生講演官傳隊，巡迴各處，隨時灌輸衛生常識與民衆，以促進民衆健康為原則。</p>
<p>（三）學校宜聘正式醫師為校醫，工等廠曁家庭也應聘請學騐俱優之正式醫師為醫藥顧問。</p>
<p>（四）醫界也應隨時發揮其天職，盡力灌輸衛生常識與民衆，力促其普及。</p>
<p>（五）當局應隨時飭派衛生警强迫民衆規定日期必要到指定地點聽講衛生常識，限期了解，至期舉行口試，生活仍不合衛生，不注重衛生，立卽處罰不貸，以儆其後。</p>
<p>（六）放映衛生敎育電影，分文不取，以收衛敎普及的實效。</p>
<p>（七）敎育當局原設之社敎科，改為衛生敎育科，聘請專家擔任推進，以達衛敎普及，各校健康敎育發達為原則。</p>
<p>（B）改善市政與人民衛生</p>
<p>（一）奇裝異服，裸腿臂，袒胸，塗脂抹粉等匪特有碍衛生，抑且有妨風化，故宜取締。</p>
<p>（二）飲食店等處之衛生事項，應由當局嚴密注意，並訂定取締專條以管理之。</p>
<p>（三）古式舊屋，宜由當局通令多闢窗戶，務使採光換氣，保暖等方面，能適合衛生原則上最低限度。</p>
<p>（四）年久失修之街道，不但崎嶇不平，行人不便，甚至難免沒有危險發生，故宜設法加以修正。</p>
<p>街頭巷尾，應多設垃圾箱，當局應多添淸道夫，實行淸除工作，並應從事衛生宣傳，使民衆注意公德，以促進與改造環境衛生。</p>
<p>（五）設立平民浴池，一切務要平民化而合乎衛生，廉價供應民衆，以養成民衆洗澡之良好習慣，　保障民衆之健康。</p>
<p>（六）組疾病保險儲蓄會，推行儲蓄制度，以備未雨綢繆，因疾病無常，醫藥費，在所難免，有錢階級固不足慮，但多數民衆，均係無產階級且月入甚微，所得有限，遇病卽難應付，甚至臨時因經濟不足而束手待斃，良可嘆也。故平時應儲蓄以供病時之需。</p>
<p>（七）增設公立醫療機關，（如區立醫院），為平民謀健康保障，為社會謀福利，關於醫藥各費應全部豁免，以求科學醫之普遍，關於免費種痘預防注射等事項，亦由本機關擔任，經費由慈善家慨助。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>打破難關關鍵在日</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>自日本川越大使來華，第一次與張外長談判後，迄於今日，卽使條件稍有伸縮，意見從未接近，故近日各報披露中日談判問題，倐謂空氣緊張，倐謂形勢和緩，其實川張兩氏談判以來，從未有一些緩和過，從未有一些樂觀過，所謂緩和云，都是一些外交上空氣作用，决非事實。</p>
<p>試問對方旣定方針，有沒有改變？侵略政策，有沒有拋棄？至多限度，不過程度問題，則緩從何來？和從何來？日方之對華侵略方針，原是一個，不過一循外交途徑進行，一不循外交途徑進行，故日方旣定之方針不變，無論循外交途徑與不循外交途徑，此路總是不通。</p>
<p>故現在欲觀中日交涉形勢之緊張與吾，當先看對方在華北之行動如何？其他且不必談，卽如任意建築飛機塲，任意增兵駐紮，任意演習大操，任意保護私運，任意投資開發華北，種種情形，是否和緩的態度，一方正在進行調解之中，而一方未曾稍撤侵略之痕跡，試問緩和何來？</p>
<p>且觀近日日方報紙之論調，其態度甚不一致，其大部份主張循外交途徑進行，而另一派報紙，則論調頗為激烈，其雙方之態度，雖有軟硬與剛柔之不同，但一則欲用和緩手叚而達到其目的，一則欲用激烈手叚而達到其目的，兩方所用手叚，雖各不同，而實有殊途同歸之妙。</p>
<p>倘主張用外交途徑解决者，果能拋棄其原來一貫之主張，而能眞正實行親善主義，固為我輩之所樂聞，萬一用外交途徑進行，而仍堅持其一貫之政策，則與其緩和而喪失國權領士，無寧激烈而喪失國權領土，鐵案如山，莫可搖動，蓋此次外交，無論如何困難，無論若何波折，在華北領土主權不能喪失毫釐外，絕無通融之餘地，此固我國全人民之公意，亦政府當局所信誓旦旦而可質諸天日者也。</p>
<p>故此次交涉難關之能彀打破與吾，全在日本，而不在我國，我國最低限度的主張，絕無絲毫通融假借者也；惟考求外報軟硬之論調，亦分兩種性質，一種姑作此兩種論調，所謂威懾利誘，軟硬兼施，使我國易於就範，此固外交手腕之一種也，一則日方對華外交，原分兩系，一主緩和，一主激進，兩派的意見，原不相容，則自身的矛盾，易起內部之糾紛，所謂廣田之自身立於歧途者也，我們現在姑不問其為手叚，或是分歧，惟當打定主張，堅持領土主權，毫厘不肯放棄，彼手叚之為硬為軟，我國可以不問。</p>
<h3>刑</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>小時候愛聽闊嘴巴張三講「殺頭」的故事，往往聽得又喜又怕，喜的是他舉手舞脚，講得有聲有色，怕的是他講得太像眞了，似乎眼前就是一塊殺人塲，滾在屋簷下那個「木墩子」，就像一個剛被斬下來的腦袋般，而且還似乎閃着眼睛呢，越聽越怕，越怕却越想聽，正合「明知山有虎，偏向虎山行，」這句成語，大約兒童心理天然如此吧。闊嘴巴張三講得最動人的地方，是在「說時遲，那時快，刀起一頭落，鮮血直冒，大家拍手，有人用饅頭醮熱血吃……」</p>
<p>像這樣怕人的情形，常會落在夢裏，急得打床上直跳起來，母親探悉情由，便不許我去宗祠和闊嘴巴張三打夥。後來不知怎的，闊嘴巴張三偸了宗祠裏的香爐燭扦，被族長吩咐人把他右腿打斷，趕出村子。那天我凑巧送棉條到姑母家去，不知他那樣有趣的人，如何受了那肉體的刑罰。</p>
<p>直到現在，我還沒見過公開行刑的情形，一則機會缺乏，二則自己的心情反不如童年了。往往運殺鷄剖魚都不忍看，亮燜燜的刀鋒，嫩薄皮肉的破裂，與血的滲濺，都能給予我强烈的殘酷的反感。雖不懷有那淺薄的「惻隱之心」，但確曾拒絕一位朋友的邀訪「殺牛公司。我眞怕臨牛物的刑塲呵。為着偶被鋼針刺破手指，痛了一夜，便使我聯想起刃鋒，絞繩，鉛彈，「剝皮機」，電椅，……種種科學的與歷史的，對付人或對付物的刑具，與勝於「針刺手指」的肉體之刑的慘酷與痛苦了。</p>
<p>可是越想避免的事，越是避免不了的，衖口那家羊肉店又應時開市了，平常每見猪肉莊鐵鈎上掛了猪頭，頸項切斷面血淸涔涔，在自己頸項間似乎會發生一絲隱痛之感，這該是神經作用吧。何况羊肉店是當衆在門口殺羊，用沸水燙，拔毛，破肚，劈腦袋，下蒸桶。那種情形，在一般人認為平淡之至。一點「吃客」們更會放出悠閒態度，評定那隻正被屠夫撳扔在長凳上祇等動刀的羊的「標水」不錯，還有人在半邊等着收買羊血或羊毛。我眞佩服他們，他們的心地畢竟要比我强出幾倍。他們對於生物的遭受死刑，完全無介於懷，在他們心眼裏，除掉「口福」和「利潤」，此外就沒有什麽預感了。或者最大的原因，在於死的不是同類？</p>
<p>然而，目今世界不亦儘多羊羣似的人羣，正被同類屠殺着嗎？却同樣地有放入出悠閒態度，懷着「利潤」算計，抱着「口福」主義，站在半邊等侯機會。這不但使我佩服，簡直使我驚嘆不止了。</p>
<p>為着每天要經過衖口，羊肉店門口殺羊的一幕，使我親眼看見的機會極多。幾乎和聽闊嘴巴張三講「殺頭」故事相彷彿，愈怕，愈不忍，却愈想看一看，這臨時的心理變態，常佔了優勢。好幾次我站在閒人堆裏看殺羊，起先羊是很馴和的被扔住在長凳上，屠夫揪起牠頭項間的皮肉，尖刀猛的對穿而過，「媽」的一聲極呌，鮮血打切斷的喉管裏冒出，淌在提桶裏。再看其餘兩隻牽縛在柱子上的羊時，牠們已在徘徊起來了，然而牠們已失去了求生存的自由。</p>
<p>第二隻動手時，居然起了一種倔强和掙扎的行動，然而，酷刑終於在屠夫的獰笑中加到牠身上。這時，我想：假使我是那第三隻羊，見到兩個同伴先後被殺了，將怎樣地悲痛憤慨，又將怎樣地解脫自身迫於眉睫的極刑。然而，羊終於是羊，羊的「肥脂」，羊的「馴和」，徒造成了一般人的「口福」與「利潤」。就像我這瘠瘦的，頻頻與命運搏鬥的人吧，不息地得挨着牛活的鞭子，這正是一種毒厲的「私刑」呵，然而，我又豈是那樣馴和的呢！</p>
<h3>墓前</h3>

<p>早晨的溫暖的太陽使人有點懶洋洋的。露珠在草叢間閃爍着。什麼東西在溫柔地輕經地沙沙作嚮。草兒，緣莽微微地深息着，發着濃郁的香氣。幾隻雀兒在竹籬圍上跳躍着，勤苦的農家早在耙着園地，鋤頭一閃一閃地在陽光底下發光。</p>
<p>我沿着那條煤屑路，轉了幾個灣，進了墳塲——找着了昨天的地方。</p>
<p>一切，還同昨天一樣：墓板上放着兩籃花，露珠在花叢間凝結着。</p>
<p>我坐下來。</p>
<p>據說：一個流浪人是善於做夢，回憶——又是戚懷的。</p>
<p>我坐着。什麽東西溜進了我的腦裏，使我不安靜起來。一時間，我湧起了許多關於過去的，未來的——不能抑止的思潮。……</p>
<p>我想起了倔强的老人，想起了自己的流浪生活。</p>
<p>我深深地嘆了口氣，自己是做夢也想不到會有一天能够親自看着自己最景仰的人進土，也想不到生前雖無緣一見，現在這個倔强的人却住得離我的居所很近——或竟可說是與我為鄰起來了。</p>
<p>我在這複雜的矛盾的心情裏，一面深味到不能補償的悲哀，一面却已阿Q式的自私地慰藉起自己來。</p>
<p>幾多年以來，常我落難在爪哇，從這個市鎭到那個市鎭，到處找求着職業的時候，當我乞了盤川渡過爪哇海到林木葱鬱，瘴煙蔓潛的婆羅洲遭了姐夫的白眼的時候，當我在廣州長堤二馬路一家客棧裏住了一個多月最後被趕了出來的時候，甚至於——當家裏入終於起了憐憫寄錢來供給我跨進了現在過着的驕貴學生生活的這個時候，我都有一股渴於訴說的念頭在燃燒着我。然而，向誰訴呢？在茫茫的人海裏，我幾乎找不到人了！——沒有夢到過這個倔强的從我在初中一的童年起就景仰着的老人，會有一天躺到我能够到的地方來。現在，我畢竟找到訴說的地方了。不管這倔强的老人是一句不嚮地躺在土坑裏，不管</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>這倔强的老人聽得到不到，我總算找到了訴說的地方。以後，我打算每一得些便坐這兒來，與老人為伴，絮絮不休地向他傾訴我數年來要訴說的話。這老人，生前旣這樣倔强，讓微菌蝕靄了兩肺還跟病魔掙扎了十年，死後，我相信他也是一樣倔强的－－也許，他能够聽到我的訴說，那就是我的滿足了！</p>
<p>墳塲工人走過，向我投過了奇異的眼光。</p>
<p>——還有工作，這墓幷沒造好呢！——他說。</p>
<p>我向他點點頭，感謝他對我的關心。</p>
<p>墳塲竹籬圍外馬路旁的石作匠叮叮地響起工作來了。</p>
<h3>襟河灣紀事</h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>襟河記之四</p>
<p>船到了襟河灣已距離我們底目的地不遠了，在這兒，我們要有半天的逗留，因為一切屯積着吃的和用的東西，都幾乎用光了。</p>
<p>灣前是一個小市集，由幾個相連的大村子築成的，前後共有兩條街道，短小而且靜寂的，兩旁懶懶的擠住了百多家土瓦房子，低小，破舊，充滿了悽凉的感覺。在半年前這兒是一個的有三萬人口的熱閙地方，有米絞，大商號，錢莊，內地土產的輸出，和外埠貨品的運進，都是由這兒出進的。可是自從閣了一次××，情形不同了，富户人家把整集子的精華都捲逃了，現在剩下的，只是這集子里的渣滓和軀穀吧了！</p>
<p>泊了船，船夫便負了一隻大口袋上岸去雜米打菜，我們留在艙里看守。有時感到了氣悶也爬出艙來站在船板上，往岸邊溜覽溜覽。也許是我們底裝束有點異於當人，我們馬上惹動了岸上來往人們底注意了，在渡頭斜坡上就滿滿的擠住了約二三十個閑散的人們，他們都是那麽瘦小，襤褸，在這樣陰冷的日子？居然還有半裸着身子的人生活着。</p>
<p>我們站立了一會，怕在岸上人集多了閙事，便向他揚着手仍想爬進艙去，不想却逗得他們大聲哄笑起來，直到我們在艙里坐定，這聲音還很光亮的在空中打旋。</p>
<p>约過了一刻鐘，聲音已經沉寂了，我們便又試探着爬出艙去，好奇的人們已經散了，渡頭靜寂寂的；可是離我們不遠的地方，却已有兩個人，鬼鬼祟祟地爬上泊岸的小駁船，朝我們底船上爬過來。</p>
<p>這兩個人，一個是约五十左右，身材短小，面孔黃瘦的老人，他穿着一身滿是彌補着破綻半裸的衣服：在他背後緊接着的是一個十四五歲的小姑娘，頭髮剪得短短的，蓬散地披在頭上，面孔尖瘦黝黑，身體矮小，穿的是一伴和她底身材絕不相稱的寬大衣服，兩隻赤脚掌靈活地搜索着每隻船板，從這兒跳到那兒的跳着。</p>
<p>這惹起了我們底好奇心，於是便注意地向他們看着。可是他們却在一隻和我們毘述的破舳板上元然地站着，老人面現憂悶而猶豫的神色，小姑娘半躱着在他背後羞怯怯地咬住衣角，面孔低下，看着她那雙枯槁的小赤足。老人向我們看了一會，忽然輕輕的對那小姑娘說道：</p>
<p>「去吧，不要害羞，他們都是些好客人。……」</p>
<p>說罷他把那小姑娘的肩膊搖幌着，回轉身，又望岸上走，小姑娘怯怯地向我們用疑慮的眼睛看了一眼，忽然靈活地跳過我們船上來，兩片薄嘴唇就輕輕的在顫着。</p>
<p>「什麼事？」我們都有點不解的向她呌着，面上露嚴厲神色，她也許想不出我們會這樣的，忙吃驚地往後退了兩步，兩隻手緊抱住頭顱，似怕我們打她底樣子，又回轉頭向岸邊看着。在岸邊老人正焦急地站着，生氣似的向她揚着手：</p>
<p>「小鬼！怕什麽，他們都是好客人。……」</p>
<p>她現着莫可奈何的神氣，又向我們回過頭來，忽然在她那深　的眼窩里，然溢出了幾顆瑩瑩的淚珠，口裏氣促地低聲嗚咽起來。</p>
<p>「你要什麽事？」我們重新向她問着，可是聲調已柔和有了。</p>
<p>、「……你老爺救救窮人……給我點錢，我向你們睡……」她用手揩着淚，聲音顫着，面上罩着重紅暈。「我們飢餓着。一點辦法也沒有。……」說罷又鳴嗚咽咽的哭了。</p>
<p>我們互相的對望着，一切什麼都明白了，是什麽使這沒成熟的姑娘做出這卑賤的事呢？是飢餓，這飢餓我們雖知道在這兒不止威脅她一個，有幾萬人和她一樣在過着的；但是一種强烈的同情心，使我們禁不住要施給她一點帮助了。我們搜索了身上現有的幾塊洋錢給她。她好像得了至寳似的用手捧着，又回過頭到岸邊去。老入滿面熌着光，忙又大聲的喊道：</p>
<p>「向老爺磕頭！」</p>
<p>可是我們把她止住，而且揚手呌她走。她疑慮着，於是回頭走了。</p>
<h3>檳城底女兒</h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>從我生長的荒僻的埠頭趁一整夜的輪船，在天色微明，曙光四射的爽朗的早晨，是靠了檳榔嶼底碼頭了。沒有來以前，我已經先有信給住在這里的姨母，所以這一天早上，我底表哥特地向他服務的洋行請了半日假，笑嘻嘻地在那碼頭上迎候我。兩年不見了的表哥，是老成得多了—一路坐了汽車向姨母家去時，我還問到了表妹伊琳。</p>
<p>「噯，伊琳麽？」表哥的臉上浮現出喜悅，「她已經是一個漂亮的少女啦。」</p>
<p>果然，在姨母家底客廳里，我會見了伊琳—修長的身段，穿着薄薄的白紗西裝，脚上却趿了一雙繡花拖鞋，顯然她是家居沒有外出。那淺淺的笑渦仍舊留在嘴角邊，肌色却比以前更黑了些，此外連頭髮也和兩年前相見時沒有兩樣。這初見的塲合中因為姨母太愛說話了，詢問着我家里底情形以及母親底健康，直到將近吃飯的時候，而伊琳却一句話也沒有打挿地，坐在一邊，捧着一本小說在看。等到姨母在飯後回房間里去安息去了，我才有機會和伊琳說起話來。</p>
<p>「伊琳，你大得多了！」我這樣地開始。</p>
<p>「是嗎！」她應着，低垂了頭，好像沒有往常那麽天眞愛鬧了。</p>
<p>我們兩年不見了，所以比較隔膜…伊琳，我得到父親底允許，到檳城來唸書是多麽可喜的事呢！我想到以後我們可以住在一起，天天見面了，就高興得什麽似地…」</p>
<p>我說，眼光直注視着她。這時，她像有什麽感觸似地抬起頭來，眼光和我底相碰了一下，然後向我說道：</p>
<p>「你可眞幸福咧。而我是不能再繼續唸書了。」</p>
<p>「什麽？你說你不唸書了嗎？」我急急地問道。</p>
<p>「不是我不愛繼續唸書了，而是父親和母親底主意。他們以為女兒一到了十七八歲，就不該再在外邊露臉了！她得藏在家里，等侯着出嫁…」</p>
<p>「有這樣的事麽？現在是什麽時代了！」我憤慨地驚呌起來。</p>
<p>但是，我底憤慨並沒有得到姨母底理解，當我向她替表妹伊琳提出抗議的時侯，她笑着回答我：「你真是不懂事的孩子哪！」在外邊，我遇見了幾個檳城底敎育家，他們告訴我檳城是中國固有的封建思想最濃原的所在；女兒們所受到的壓迫是沒有人同情的。他們還說無論在馬來半島底任何一處，女子敎育都來得普及些，就祇有檳城，是烏烟瘴氣的。</p>
<p>伊琳對於她底前途好像只聽命運的支配，一點也不參加自己底意見—這是如何的錯誤！暑假是快要過去了，各學校都在為開學期的迫近而忙碌，我也去一家中學報了名。伊琳呢，還是藏在家里看看小說，打發她底暗淡的日子。我實在不能看過去了，有一决，我抓住她這樣地說道：</p>
<p>「伊琳，你聽我說幾句話吧。一個女子和男子有什麽兩樣呢？她應當和男子一樣享受生存的權利，受同等的敎育！你要是聽起頑固的老父親底話來，那麽你只是一個奴隸吧了，你底自由在那里，幸福又在那里呢？伊琳，去讀書吧。檳城不能容你這樣做時，你不是可以回到祖國去嗎？你哥哥會給你經濟上的帮助的，我今早和他說好了。」</p>
<p>聽了我一口氣說到這里，伊琳像很受感動似地將書扔在一邊，問着：</p>
<p>「眞的麼？哥哥眞的可以做到麽？」</p>
<p>「你自己問他去好了。」</p>
<p>表哥什麼都答應了，這個本來馴服如羔羊的伊琳突然掀起了反抗的情緒。在一個下着微雨的早晨，天剛剛亮的時候，伊琳携了簡單的行李，由我和表哥護送到輪船碼頭，在家里留下一封給父母的信。伊琳在赴碼頭的途中，用少有的興奮喊着：</p>
<p>「古老的檳城啊，別了！眞的別了！」</p>
<p>雨霏霏地下着，下着！到碼頭上的時候，下得更大，簡直像要把檳城冲洗一番似地，使人感到加倍的愉快。</p>
<p>船笛嗚嗚地呌着時，伊琳站在甲板上向我們揮手。她底心里一定還在呌喊着：</p>
<p>「眞的別了，古老的檳城啊！」</p>

<h3>「老虎結婚」</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>靑年會九樓又是一次盛况</p>
<p>眞是運倖，我剛從外埠回來，就接到朋友的電話，說「偉大的老虎」鄭君里和黃晨小姐在八仙橋靑年會化樓結婚。</p>
<p>雖然沒有接到「我們今日…」的通知書，叨在見過幾次「虎面」，就放下一切要動手的工作，僱車到靑年會去。由電梯送上九樓的時候，我忽然想起了唐納，藍蘋：趙丹，業露茜；顧而已，杜小鵑一對藝人結婚的時候，做冰翁的就是鄭君里和李淸，（李淸現在已進聯華，已經開始　「聯華交響曲」中的一段　那天許多朋友問他幾時結婚，他祇是笑而不答，因為「標準丫頭」那天也在座，同來的是一位「南國頭髮的南國少年，這情形實在使我們的老虎太激刺了。</p>
<p>但是在演「欽差大臣」的時候，在金城大戲院的後台，由顧夢鶴的介紹，他和黃晨小姐認識了，由認識而戀愛，由戀愛而結婚，瞧着君里滿面春風地和每個來賓握手，做他朋友的似乎也有一種「傳染」的快感，這快感像喝着葡萄酒一樣。趙丹，唐納，施超，還有「商會會長」殷秀岑就受了葡萄酒的推動，在沈鈞儒先生致詞之後，高興地催促新郞新娘報吿戀愛經過。結果是抄了老文章，「如此這般，」謝謝諸位！</p>
<p>為了祝賀「有情人終成眷屬，」有人發起簽名，每人出公份一元，請新郞新婚跳舞去，於是三四十人一路浩浩蕩蕩直抵麗都，」我因為時間太晚了先走，大概這一晚上的快活是無法形之於筆墨的。</p>
<p>末了。在恭祝新夫婦為社會努力之餘，我更希望着在不久的將來聽到三對藝人結婚時另一位冰翁的喜訊。（上為新夫婦簽字式）</p>

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon's Sixth Meeting: Zhang Qun and Kawagoe Tatsusuke Exchange Views on Adjustments; Results Show Both Sides Still Far Apart; Shimizu Visits Gao Zongwu for Consultation; Sato Flew to Beijing Once Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10:00 AM on the 26th, Shimizu, a secretary from the Japanese Embassy, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for consultations. At 4:00 PM, Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang held their sixth meeting, again at the Foreign Minister's residence. The talks lasted for over two hours, continuing previous discussions and exchanging views on adjusting relations. However, the two sides still did not reach an agreement, and it was decided to reschedule for further talks. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 4:00 PM on the 26th, Kawagoe Shigeru, the Japanese Ambassador to China, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs residence to continue exchanging views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. The talks lasted for over two hours, but the two sides' opinions still did not converge, and it was decided to reschedule for further talks. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sato, the Japanese Naval Attaché, accompanied by an attendant, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai to call on Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe. After completing his business, he returned to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 10:00 AM on the 26th, and will come to Nanjing again with Suma upon his return to China and arrival in Shanghai. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, believing that he still needed to continue exchanging views with Foreign Minister Zhang on the matter of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, contacted Foreign Minister Zhang over the weekend to arrange a visit. Foreign Minister Zhang scheduled it for the morning of the 26th, and Kawagoe was received at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 26th. It is reported that Ambassador Kawagoe had previously met with Foreign Minister Zhang twice on the 19th and 21st to exchange views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. However, because the opinions of the two sides were too far apart, they ultimately could not reach an agreement. Kawagoe's visit to Foreign Minister Zhang again on the 26th is widely believed to be in accordance with instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey new Japanese opinions on adjusting the relationship between the two countries. Furthermore, Shimizu, a secretary from the Japanese Embassy, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 10:00 AM on the 26th, reportedly to arrange the time for Ambassador Kawagoe's visit to Foreign Minister Zhang at noon on the 26th. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kawagoe and Zhang Qun will hold their sixth meeting this afternoon to discuss the most difficult issues hindering the talks. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering countermeasures based on the results of Ambassador Xu's meeting with Foreign Minister Arita. The Chinese side still insists on the principles of not compromising sovereignty, preserving administrative rights, and mutual equality, hoping to reach a compromise through negotiations. Ambassador Kawagoe, in accordance with the policy of his own government, strongly advocated the fairness and appropriateness of Japan's demands, seeking to dispel misunderstandings on the Chinese side. With such opposing stances in the negotiations between China and Japan, achieving a compromise requires extreme enthusiasm and a major decision. Therefore, it is not difficult to foresee that the negotiations will be full of twists and turns. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison in Peiping and Tianjin Holds Large-Scale Maneuvers; Started Yesterday Morning and Will Last for Ten Days; Mobilizing Over Seven Thousand Troops; Staff Officers from the Military Headquarters Participate; Unprecedentedly Large-Scale; With the Peiping-Mukden Railway Line and Junliangcheng as Target for Seizure</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The large-scale maneuvers of the Japanese garrison in North China began simultaneously in Peiping and Tianjin on the morning of the 26th. At 4:20 AM, 160 Japanese cavalrymen with 150 horses, seven field guns, and eight light machine guns boarded a special train on the Peiping-Mukden Railway and departed for Fengtai. At 5:40 AM, another 300 Japanese infantrymen, five mountain guns, eighteen heavy machine guns, 50 horses, and two train cars of military supplies, also boarded a special train and departed from Tianjin for Fengtai. At 5:10 AM, 400 infantry and artillerymen, two field guns, and one train car of supplies from the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan departed for Junliangcheng. 100 of them came to Tianjin around 6:00 AM. Since the 25th, over 2,000 Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin have been gathering day and night in the Chengtangzhuang and Dazhigu suburbs of Tianjin. Staff officers from the military headquarters have all been ordered to participate. This large-scale maneuver is an unprecedented event since the Japanese army stationed in North China 30 years ago. Japanese officials stated that when Nakamura Kotaro was the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China five years ago, he gathered all the troops, totaling 2,000 men, for five days of maneuvers in plains warfare. Since then, successive commanders have only conducted regimental maneuvers, and none have lasted as long as these ten-day maneuvers with over 7,000 troops mobilized. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army's large-scale maneuvers in the suburbs of Tianjin on the 26th had the Peiping-Mukden Railway line and Junliangcheng as the target for seizure. Commander Kayashima of the Second Regiment set up his headquarters in Dazhigu, using 2,000 infantry and artillerymen from Haiguangsi and the Dongju district of Tianjin as the main force, wearing white armbands. The cavalry, infantry, artillery, and chemical warfare units from Shanhaiguan, Tangshan, and Tanggu acted as the enemy, wearing red armbands, under the command of Major Shinabe. The white army was mainly defending, while the red army was mainly attacking. The simulated battle was that the red army landed from Tanggu, advancing westward along the Peiping-Mukden Railway to capture Junliangcheng. Upon receiving the report, the white army made a forced march at dawn to reinforce the city, encountering the enemy near Junliangcheng and engaging in an unexpected battle. The red army relied on chemical warfare equipment for a fierce attack, while the white army used a large outflanking maneuver to cut off the red army's maritime communications between Tanggu and Dagu, causing the red army to become unable to sustain the attack and retreat towards XianShuiGu. The maneuvers ended at 4:00 PM. At night, there was reconnaissance warfare. 420 veterans in Tianjin were gathered by Chairman Tamura and hastily formed into an army late at night to disrupt the white army's rear lines, assuming the white army as the enemy. They contacted plainclothes squads and raided the Dazhigu area. The National Defense Women's Association and the Juvenile Volunteer Corps, and all armed organizations of Japanese residents in North China joined in, participating in battles in the suburbs of Tianjin and Peiping. Eight-tenths of the troops in Tianjin, Tangshan, and YuTang were deployed, leaving only a small number to guard the camps. Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Approximately one thousand Japanese troops began large-scale maneuvers this afternoon and deployed defensive positions in Chinese villages near the former Belgian concession in preparation for resisting another contingent attacking from the east.

The area around Fengtai will be the site of large-scale plains warfare. Suzuki, Nagasaki, Sasaki, Asai, and others from the Japanese army in Tianjin went to participate in the morning.

<h3>Wang Ying's Bandits Dissatisfied by a Certain Party; His Troops Assigned to Li Shouxin's Command; Plan to Invade Sui Thus Becomes Silent</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, at the previous military conference held by the Chahar bandit army at Jiabusi Temple, the Wang Ying's puppet troops were ordered to reorganize and complete the task within one month. Recently, it was reported that Wang Ying was resolved by a certain party due to some kind of suspicion, but on the other hand, it was reported that Wang is still recruiting troops and buying horses as usual, preparing to invade. Our side has taken strict precautions and reported to Beiping for instructions, and will then return to Sui to oversee the situation. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, it is true that the Chahar bandit Wang Ying has recently been dissatisfied by a certain party. The reason is that the certain party previously supported Wang Ying and others purely to use them to recruit all scattered bandits and expand their strength to invade Sui. Once the bandits were recruited and reorganized, they would appoint someone else to replace Wang Ying. For example, the shooting of Wang Ying's subordinate Da Yi was one such example. Now, Wang Ying has recruited a total of eight thousand bandit troops. The certain party plans to assign most of them to Li Shouxin's command. Therefore, Li's puppet troops have advanced to the Daqinggou area. This is indeed an attempt to take Wang's defense area and replace him. It is said that Wang's attitude has been very negative recently, so the plan to invade Sui has also become silent because of this. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Next, he stated the functions of science for mankind, including the following: (1) Science is a tool to promote social progress; (2) Science can improve the enjoyment of people's lives; (3) Science is the foundation of material construction; (4) Science is the driving force for national defense. He then stated that the development of science is inevitable, and said that in the past our country's science was not weaker than foreign countries. There are many reasons why we are now behind, but the biggest reason is that our people do not know the importance of science and do not pay attention to scientific research. He said that our country has now been unified, and there will be many construction projects in the future, all of which will require scientific assistance. He hopes that everyone will be enthusiastic about initiating scientific research, so that all construction projects in our country can be completed quickly. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Calculation Method of Income Tax: Ministry of Finance Compiles Explanation and Orders Subordinates to Take Note; Also Stipulates the Scope of Public Officials</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance recently sent letters to various agencies across the country, stating that income tax on the salaries and remuneration of public officials has already been levied. However, there have been changes in this tax rate and progressive calculation method compared to the income donation previously collected by the Central Government. Regarding tax calculation, the "Calculation Table of Taxable Amount for Category II Income" and "Collection Instructions" were previously printed and distributed separately. Now, an explanation of the scope of public officials and the calculation method of their salary and remuneration income has been formulated and attached to the letter to make it easier for withholding agencies to understand. The main points of the explanation are as follows: 1. The scope of public officials is as follows: (1) Committee members and staff of party committees at all levels and their affiliated agencies; (2) Staff of central and local governments and their affiliated agencies; (3) Staff and teachers of national, provincial, municipal, and county schools; (4) Staff of government-operated enterprises; (5) Personnel of local autonomous organizations; (6) Other personnel engaged in public service in accordance with laws and regulations. 2. Laborers and workers in the aforementioned agencies are not public officials and should fall within the scope of other practitioners. 3. For public officials whose salary and remuneration income is calculated on a monthly basis, if the income is less than one month, the actual amount of income should be used to calculate the tax at the original tax rate. 4. If various agencies fail to pay full salaries on a monthly basis, taxes should be levied according to the following methods: (1) For those who receive discounted salaries, the tax should be calculated based on the actual amount issued first, and when the supplementary payment is made, it should be combined with the amount already issued to calculate and pay the supplementary tax; for those who use borrowing to replace salary payment, the actual amount borrowed each month should be used to calculate and pay the supplementary payment in accordance with the previous regulations. 5. If the salary and remuneration income is calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of income for one year should be divided by the number of months in a year, and the amount obtained should be the average amount per month. 6. If the income is periodic, the number of months in the period and the total amount of income should be averaged according to the previous method. 7. If the salary and remuneration income includes both monthly income and annual income, or periodic income, and there are more than two types, it should be combined and averaged. 8. In all cases involving items 3 to 7, the withholding agency should specify them separately in the withholding list when reporting. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anti-Smuggling Committee May Not Confiscate Private Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shantou Silk Industry Association previously established an anti-smuggling committee to prevent smuggling, and formulated measures to ban private goods, which were submitted to the Chaozhou Customs Superintendent for referral to the Ministry of Finance for record. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance believes that the association's enthusiasm in assisting the government in anti-smuggling is commendable. However, the measures submitted for banning private goods, which include confiscating private goods and imposing fines, are beyond the scope of authority. Because the execution of confiscating private goods and imposing fines are both within the authority of the Customs. If various associations discover private goods or the purchase of private goods, they should immediately report to the Customs or assist the Customs in investigating and seizing them. They should not be allowed to handle it themselves. The registration of commercial goods should also comply with the "Provisional Regulations for Inspection of Imported Goods Transportation and Sales" previously promulgated. The Chaozhou Customs Superintendent has been ordered to revise it properly and notify the Customs Superintendents in its area to take note of it. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A fire broke out in the library of the Ministry of Interior at around 7:00 pm on the evening of the 25th. Three rooms were burned down.

<h3>Chengdu and Chongqing (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Chang Qing</p>
<p>There have been many records of the scenery of Chengdu in newspapers and magazines. In short, it is very elegant and beautiful. The trees in public parks such as Shaocheng Park, Zhiji Stone Park, and Beicheng Park... are all tall and soaring in the air. Every household in the major streets and alleys plants a poplar, sycamore, locust, mulberry, cypress... or other trees in front of their doors to complement the scenery. There are even more gardens in private mansions. If you climb high and look out, the rooftops are covered with a lush green. Chengdu has originally been afforested. At sunset, it is simply a beautiful urban painting. Chongqing, on the other hand, has no better places to visit other than Nanwenquan and Beiwenquan. There are few trees in the city. The artificial scenery of the parks is not as natural as that of Chengdu. The land force of each family member seems to be like an invaded country, and the territory is shrinking very pitifully. The houses are mostly built several stories high, but this is not the residence of the general gentry class. Most of them are several families or dozens of families living together. Light is not easily revealed. It is so dark and humid. Living inside makes people feel suffocated. In summer, it is even hotter, making everyone feel uncomfortable. Compared to the climate, Chengdu is very gentle.</p>
<p>Although Chengdu is located in the westernmost corner of Sichuan, its material civilization is not lagging behind. Speaking of construction, it seems to be more advanced than Chongqing. The roads in Chengdu, whether major streets or alleys, were built flat and smooth for "East Ocean cars" [rickshaws] very early on. Chongqing is still building roads in the city. Because of the undulating terrain of the city, the transportation tool that is considered to be a thing of the past – sedan chairs – is still prevalent. However, judging from the authorities' efforts in construction, Chongqing is actually putting in more effort and developing faster than Chengdu. Chongqing's tap water pipes have been widely installed in every citizen's home, and the previously difficult problem of water use has now been completely resolved. The construction of houses is more elaborate than in Chengdu. New villages and municipal hospitals are also being planned. As for the rectification of the city appearance and the equipment of fire protection... these are indeed several times better than they were five years ago.</p>
<p>Since the slogan "Sichuan as the base for national rejuvenation" was put forward, many people from other provinces have let go and ran into Sichuan. Chengdu has also become more prosperous day by day along with Chongqing. Many new hotels, restaurants, and teahouses have been added, and entertainment venues are springing up like mushrooms after rain, even surpassing Chongqing in vigor. In the commercial center area designated as the Chengdu Special Zone, Chunxi Road Commercial Square, Zongfu Street, and Dongda Street are illuminated by neon lights at night, and the tourists are like weaving. All the shops are brazenly making enticing promotions. Gramophones and radios are turned on together to compete for business. The liveliness is no less than that of Chongqing. However, when asked about the real trade situation, it can be said that the doors may seem bustling, but there are few customers. This fully demonstrates the urban economy's external strength and internal weakness.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors: I have just read in your newspaper today a Nanjing dispatch stating, "The National Association of Chinese Cotton Mill Owners has petitioned for urgent relief," and so on. Upon investigation, our association has not recently petitioned the government for relief. Upon careful examination of the reported items, they seem to be resolutions passed by the Chinese Textile Engineering Society four or five months ago, or matters submitted by that society to the central government for review, and thus mistakenly attributed to our association. We hereby request a correction. Respectfully request your attention to this matter. With best wishes for your well-being. Secretariat of the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association.

<h3>The Union of Italy and Germany and the Crisis in Europe</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited Berlin the other day and met with the German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath, deciding on eight points of cooperation between the two countries in diplomacy. This so-called "cooperation," in its form and wording, seems to resolve the contradictions between the two countries and propel Europe towards "construction" and "peace." In reality, this is not the case. The union of Italy and Germany is merely a temporary compromise on the Austrian issue, changing from a competition for hegemony to a temporary agreement. In other areas, due to the "full cooperation" of these two fascist aggressor states, the crisis of peace in Europe will become increasingly severe.</p>
<p>Let us examine the eight points of cooperation between the two countries announced by Ciano. From the first to the fourth points, it can be said that they concern general diplomatic unity, that is, the two countries will adopt a unified stance on the Western European Pact countries, the League of Nations, and the Danube River issues. The fifth point concerns Spain, where the two countries express support for the fascist rebels who share their views. This shows that although they have not formally recognized the rebel government, recognition is imminent. The sixth and seventh points express their joint support for fascism and opposition to Bolshevism. The eighth concerns Germany's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. In addition, it is said that there is another agreement, indicating that Italy agrees to support Germany's demand for the restoration of colonies. None of this is revealed.</p>
<p>In summary, these two countries, which are striving to overthrow the international status quo and expand their power abroad, have decided to mutually recognize their demands that hinder peace, and to adopt a unified hostile attitude towards the forces currently maintaining the status quo and upholding peace in the international community. For example, the so-called "promoting the Western European Pact" refers to Italy's support for Germany's position on the Locarno issue. Germany's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is clearly a quid pro quo for Italy's support for Germany's recovery of colonies. As for the League of Nations, the only cornerstone of the current international peace system, the two countries have also decided on a unified strategy based on their shared opposition. Such so-called "full cooperation," if the beautiful rhetoric of "peace" and "construction" is removed, does not allow us to be optimistic about the future of the European situation.</p>
<p>Not only can we not be optimistic, but we will also feel that the current crisis in Europe is increasingly irreversible. The most obvious is the issue of Spain. The struggle between the Spanish rebels and the People's Front government over who is illegal and who is legal has long been judged by the international community. However, while democratic forces around the world sympathize with the legitimate government of Spain, Germany and Italy, solely because of their shared fascist sentiments and their ambitions in the Mediterranean and Africa, have disregarded the non-intervention agreement and vigorously aided the rebels in secret. Who is to blame for the bloodshed all over the Iberian Peninsula? Anyone with a sense of justice will understand. Now, Portugal, influenced by Germany and Italy, has formally severed diplomatic relations with the Madrid government and recognized the rebel government, as a prelude to Germany and Italy's recognition of the rebel government. The serious significance of this behavior, which violates international norms, cannot be ignored. Moreover, due to Germany and Italy's violation of the non-intervention agreement, the Soviet Union has also been forced to take free action. In the future, the development of conflicts in the Mediterranean will be unstoppable.</p>
<p>At this time, the response of Britain and France is extremely important. The People's Front in France was originally not strong enough in unity, but after this Radical Socialist Party congress, the internal divisions within the People's Front have been patched up, which is gratifying. However, France's foreign policy must be constrained by Britain. The stubbornness of the British Conservative government and the weakness and incompetence of the Labour Party have caused British foreign policy to waver between upholding the collective peace system and condoning fascist aggression. This flaw has not been remedied to this day. If the current crisis in Europe becomes more serious, even causing the final tragedy, the vacillating politicians of Britain will have to bear a great responsibility.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Old and Young in Madrid Dig Trenches Along the Capital, Braving the Cold and Rain, as the Rebels Prepare for a Second General Offensive</h3>
<p>Madrid: The government has advised all residents of the capital to dig trenches around the city to prevent the rebel advance. As a result, several thousand people, old and young, set out to work in the suburbs this morning, each carrying shovels and lunch boxes. Despite the rain and cold weather, they did not seem to mind. An uninformed observer would have thought they were on a holiday outing in the countryside. In addition, most of the young people belonging to various labor unions are taking advantage of their free time to conduct military exercises. This afternoon, more than 20,000 young workers marched in formation in the center of the capital. However, only a few of them carried rifles. Residents of the city generally expressed optimism, believing that everyone would soon be able to obtain weapons to fight. They also believed that although rebel aircraft occasionally threatened the capital, the government would soon obtain fighter planes to defend against enemy air raids. According to general opinion, the labor unions could supply 40,000 to 50,000 strong men to the front lines if necessary. Also, at 4:30 this afternoon, several rebel aircraft soared in the sky over the capital, but they flew very high and soon left. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: At 10 AM today, four workers' organizations in Barcelona held a mass meeting at the city's bullring. Ten thousand people participated, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The workers' organizations belonging to various parties and factions in Barcelona jointly agreed on Thursday of last week to unite against foreign aggression. Therefore, a mass meeting was convened today to announce this. Representatives from various workers' organizations gave speeches, calling on workers to sacrifice everything for the war. Workers had obtained the right to a 40-hour work week and a 15% wage increase on July 15th of this year. Due to the urgency of the war, workers should temporarily give up this right. Next, a representative of the Catalan Autonomous Government reported on the results of last night's government meetings. The meeting decided to mobilize people of all classes, confiscate all civilian firearms, and convert all industries to a "collective production" system. The meeting then adjourned in cheers.

<p>Darafanra: A special dispatch from our reporter. People in the National Army Command on the front lines here now believe that the city of Madrid is within easy reach. It will fall within three days at the earliest, and ten days at the latest. The only unknown is how to capture it. In general, General Franco's troops are in high spirits, with sharp weapons, and victory is assured. There is no need to make unnecessary sacrifices to achieve a quick victory. General Franco himself does not want to bombard the capital fiercely to avoid the suffering of the people. Therefore, he will leave a lifeline for the residents of the capital, allowing them to escape the encirclement to the port of Valencia in the east. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish National Revolutionary Army will issue a general attack order on Madrid in a few hours. According to General Varela, a leader of the National Army, Madrid will be occupied by Thursday of this week. The National Army acknowledges that it suffered a setback in the area of Pimi Linoz, but claims that after the government forces counterattacked Lasna, Vas, and Talmax, they were stopped from advancing. At present, Naval Piral is in fierce fighting. According to officials of the National Army, the army suffered a slight setback at the beginning of the attack, but soon turned defeat into victory, and Escorial will fall imminently.

Alanyus is located on a high mountain with steep cliffs, making it a strategic point for guarding the capital of Madrid. After the city falls, the final decisive battle to attack Madrid will begin. Currently, all units of the National Army are deployed on the southern and western sides of the capital. As soon as the order is given, they can pounce forward. General Mullah, the commander-in-chief of the entire front, arrived in the city of Dolius this month to discuss everything with General Varela, the commander of the colonial army. According to recent reports, General Varela has contributed the most to the National Army's capture of various fortresses around the capital. However, the colonial army's organization is not unified, and it lacks the effect of coordinated assistance. Therefore, it is generally expected that an order will be issued tomorrow to adjust the command of the various armies on the front lines and to delineate the battle lines of each army separately before a general attack can begin.

<p>Escorial Rebel Front Line</p>
<p>The Spanish rebels advanced seven miles towards Madrid in the past two days, as if entering a no-man's land. Although the rugged mountains and rocks along the way could be used by the government forces to defend, the rebel advance only encountered a small number of government forces, artillery, and machine gun resistance. The left wing of the rebels has reached the area of Bigrino, while the rebels in Nova Telmark are dancing and making merry in the streets with a group of young girls.

<p>Valtermoro Government Forces Front Line: The town of Xinpu Ruiluo, 17 miles from Madrid, was evacuated in panic today, but the militia remained to defend the town and prevent the rebel advance. Government forces and rebels are currently engaged in fierce artillery battles, and rebels are bombing the town with aircraft. (National News dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Spanish rebel General Talano officially announced on the Cesal radio station today that the government forces' attempt to recapture Illesca had been repelled, with 300 killed and 100 captured, including Golell, a reporter for the Associated Press. Talano said that after Golell confirmed that he was a reporter, he was treated with courtesy. However, Mini Fee, a reporter for the New York Tribune, and Weaver, a reporter for the London News Chronicle, have been missing since this morning after leaving Madrid for the front lines. Nava Hong, the driver of the Associated Press reporter, returned to the capital alone after Golell was captured, saying that they arrived at Vol de Moro at 1 PM. It was said that they could travel three kilometers south, but they still saw nothing upon reaching their destination. He repeatedly urged Nava not to go any further, but he refused to listen and continued for five kilometers in a car full of soldiers. Suddenly, they encountered a rebel tank, which opened fire with a machine gun. Golell immediately jumped into a small ditch, while the driver turned the car around. When the tank approached, Golell took out the American flag hidden in his sleeve, which saved him from being crushed to death. The area is on the highway between Madrid and Alandus, only 17 miles south of Madrid. (National News dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: According to unconfirmed reports today, plans for the Spanish government to abandon Madrid have been completed. It is also heard that 82 rebel aircraft flew over Madrid today, distributing leaflets warning the government to surrender to avoid bloodshed. (National News dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: According to the Lisbon Daily News, two large aircraft parked at the Madrid airfield, preparing to carry Western government officials to a safe area when the rebels launched their final offensive, have reportedly been destroyed by bombing by National Army aircraft. Rebel aircraft also reported that a giant bomber, en route to the rebel headquarters in Burgos, presumably to bomb the town, had been shot down and destroyed. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Portugal Refutes Soviet Russia, Says It is Inciting Internal Strife</h3>
<p>(London) Portugal's response to the Soviet Union's accusation that the country is aiding the Spanish rebels has been submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee. The original text has been published today. The rebuttal states that the Soviet Union has attempted to incite a communist revolution in Portugal and provoke war between Portugal and Spain. Soviet Ambassador to Spain Rosenberg has effectively controlled the Madrid government and recently secretly convened Madrid communists to elect Gabalello as prime minister. Soviet officers are currently planning the defense of Madrid, and dozens of Soviet airmen with chemicals have arrived at the Getterfield airfield in Madrid. The note further states that a Soviet Union is "striving to achieve victory in the first war it has created." The Portuguese note then refutes the Soviet Union's accusation, stating that Portugal must purchase foreign arms to strengthen its national defense. Therefore, it is unfounded to accuse Portugal of supplying arms to the Spanish rebels. (National News dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Communist Party Leader's Speech Interrupted and Expelled</h3>
<p>Denver, USA: US Communist Party presidential candidate Browder was giving a speech here today when a group calling themselves "Red-Blooded Americans" stormed the stage, expelled Browder, and injured 12 members of the audience. Browder was speaking in an open space to an audience of 400 people when suddenly someone shouted, "Red-Blooded Americans, those of you who cannot tolerate this, come quickly!" Before the shout had ended, about 20 men wearing American veterans' hats, each holding pistols and iron weapons, rushed into the crowd, injuring 12 people and tearing off the clothes of three people. They went to the stage, tore up flags, and overturned the stage. By this time, Browder had escaped into a small grove. Later, he told an Associated Press reporter in a hotel that six audience members were receiving medical treatment for injuries, and three women had been knocked to the ground, but only suffered minor injuries. Although Browder repeatedly asked the audience not to resist, the women scratched the faces of the thugs, and the men threw mud. Browder also said that he had repeatedly requested police protection, but to no avail. One of the thugs was even a special police officer. Browder will now file a lawsuit with the prosecutor.

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The stock market this morning was slightly affected by the unsettled overseas political situation and the upcoming domestic elections. The prices of most stocks fell uniformly. For example, the decline in automobile and steel stocks was strong. Copper mining stocks fell in price following the announcement that production had increased to 95% of production capacity.

The stock prices in New York are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>New Record for China's Cotton Production This Year</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Department of Agriculture today released a report from its Shanghai-based commissioner, Dawson, stating that China produced 3.65 million bales of cotton this year, each bale weighing 500 pounds, setting a new record. The estimates for the minor provinces are still low. The weather was very good during the harvest, so this amount is likely to increase in the future. The increase in China's cotton production this year is largely due to the expansion of cotton-growing areas. In most places, however, the quality of cotton is lower than last year. Although this year's harvest is abundant, cotton prices in China are very high. Only 80% of the yarn factories run by Chinese in the country are operating, while all of the yarn factories run by Japanese are operating. (National News dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>The Locarno Question: The Content of Belgium's Reply; The Expansion of Armies by Various Countries Threatens Belgium; The Franco-Belgian Alliance is Sufficient Grounds for Justification</h3>
<p>Regarding the question of convening a future Locarno conference, the Belgian government submitted a reply to the British government's note of September 18th on Friday of last week (the 23rd), and it was delivered to the Foreign Office by the country's ambassador to Britain, Mashian. It is understood that its content explains the country's new position in diplomacy after King Leopold III's recent declaration of neutrality. It states that since the countries have been sparing no effort in strengthening their armies, the effectiveness of the Locarno Treaty in guaranteeing Belgium's security has been greatly reduced, and the risk of Belgium suffering foreign aggression has greatly increased. The reason why Belgium has adopted a new policy is precisely this. The Locarno Treaty stipulates that the signatory countries should collectively maintain the current state of the territories of European countries. This obligation was originally extremely important for small countries like Belgium. However, at that time, Germany's armaments had been withdrawn, the Rhineland had been designated a demilitarized zone, and the power of the League of Nations was still substantial. Therefore, the effectiveness of the Locarno Treaty in guaranteeing Belgium's security was still more than sufficient. This is precisely the reason why Belgium ratified this treaty. Since then, first, Germany rearmed, and then disputes arose between Italy and Abyssinia, weakening the authority of the League of Nations. In addition, France is pursuing a policy of alliance, and European countries are in danger of being divided into two major groups confronting each other. The times have changed, and the situation is as such. After the French and Belgian general staffs concluded a technical cooperation agreement, the defensive fortifications built by Belgium will inevitably be regarded by Germany as an extension of France's eastern "Maginot Line." Therefore, if France and Germany were to clash, Belgian territory would undoubtedly be invaded. If so, Belgium might be annihilated before the guarantor countries of the Locarno Treaty could come to its aid. In short, if Belgium can act in a way that gives other countries no excuse to invade its territory, the security of Western Europe, especially the security of Britain, will be enhanced. After Belgium's above-mentioned reply was delivered, the British Cabinet will study it within this week. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Talks Between Italy and Germany Will Continue in the Future</h3>
<p>Munich: Regarding the discussions of Foreign Minister Ciano of Italy and other important Italian personnel during their stay in Leed, an authoritative source issued a statement today, stating that the talks between Italy and Ciano and German Prime Minister Hitler and important German personnel involved all current political, economic, and social issues of importance that are directly related to the two countries. The atmosphere was extremely friendly and sincere. As a result of the exchange of views, agreement was reached on all important issues. Both governments attach importance to advocating international peace and rebuilding normal life in the international community. In order to implement all resolutions, both governments are willing to continue contacts. (National News dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Count Ciano, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, went to Germany for consultation and held talks with German leader Hitler in the city of Berchtesgaden. Afterward, he was able to travel to the city of Siena, where he was given a grand welcome by the local authorities and the public. He has now completed his public duties and returned here by plane from Siena at 1:15 PM today. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Arrives in Hungary to Discuss German-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary - Following Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya's visit to Austria in September of this year, Austrian Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt arrived here from Vienna at 11:00 AM today to return the visit. Schmidt is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya this afternoon, and will be received by Regent Horthy on Wednesday before returning to Vienna. Well-informed sources suggest that Schmidt's visit is to discuss the impact of the recent talks in Berlin between German and Italian officials on Central Europe, as well as the future of the proposed Vienna conference between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. It is noted that these three countries have expressed their willingness to allow other nations to join the Rome Protocols previously signed by them. Furthermore, Czech Prime Minister Hodza recently declared that Central European countries could use the Little Entente as a foundation for larger collaborative efforts. This indicates that Schmidt's visit is motivated by the more compromising attitude of Hungary's current Prime Minister Darányi compared to his predecessor Gömbös, and aims to seize this opportunity to negotiate the inclusion of other nations in the Rome Protocols.

<h3>Belgian Fascist Party's Plan to March on the Capital Fails; Arrested Members Gradually Released; Heated Debate at Socialist Party Congress</h3>
<p>Brussels - The Rexist Party's plan to "march" on Brussels has clearly failed completely. Today, the police were able to maintain order without resorting to force. Rexist Party members who gathered in various locations were dispersed by the police, and over 250 people were arrested. Except for important figures in the party, the rest were released after brief questioning. The party's Secretary-General, Yvan Hallux, issued a statement to the press, stating that "Our party leader, Léon Degrelle, is still detained by the police, but the charges against him are still unknown. We only know that he requested paper and pen from the police to write his first article from prison for the party's newspaper. Others arrested with Degrelle include Member of Parliament Canape and Senator Count de Thiennes. Count de Thiennes was allegedly mistreated by the police. The party has scheduled a meeting tonight to elect an interim leader to 'replace Degrelle.'" The Rexist Party also issued a statement strongly protesting the arrest of its leader, Degrelle, stating that the party will continue to respect the law and calling on the nation to "denounce the red dictatorship and Soviet-style violence." In addition, Justice Minister Bovesse told a reporter from this agency, "The government is determined to maintain order throughout the country, and any disruptive behavior, regardless of its origin, will be punished. Rexist Party leader Degrelle is inciting the public by claiming a communist threat. Some people are misled by him and become alarmed. It should be known that the government firmly opposes dictatorship of any kind. The majority of the people support the government, and the government will adopt a firm and moderate policy to maintain public support. The government is responsible for maintaining order and will not allow anyone to interfere." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Brussels - People here were anticipating a bloody Sunday, as over 250,000 Belgian Fascist party members were expected to hold a demonstration against the government's orders. However, they were pleasantly surprised that today passed peacefully. Most of the troublemakers did not appear. It is reported that although several groups of Belgian Fascist party members gathered in the streets and clashed with police, resulting in over 200 arrests, the crimes committed by the party members were merely disobeying police orders and refusing to move. Overall, yesterday passed peacefully, with only one Socialist party member being shot in the foot by a Fascist in front of the party headquarters, and two police officers receiving minor injuries while dispersing Fascists, and are currently being treated in the hospital. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Brussels - Following yesterday's arrest of Fascist Rexist Party leader Léon Degrelle and over 200 party members for holding demonstrations, in addition to the release of a batch last night, all the important figures were also released this morning. Some party members held demonstrations in the city center last night, but the momentum was weak and they were dispersed by the police. The situation in the capital has now returned to normal. The general impression is that Degrelle and the Rexist Party's two demonstrations have suffered a major defeat. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Brussels - The Socialist Party is currently holding a congress here. Minister without Portfolio Vandervelde will present a report on the international situation, mentioning the Spanish problem, stating, "Portugal has now severed diplomatic relations with the Spanish government. The future of the international situation is extremely serious. All countries participating in the non-intervention agreement should reconsider the Spanish situation. As a member of the Belgian government, I am bound by the decisions of the government, but as the leader of the Belgian Socialist Party, I dare say that the aid our party is willing to give to Spain does not violate the decision to ban arms shipments. Money and clothing can be sent to Spain." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Brussels - At the Socialist Party congress yesterday, Foreign Minister Spaak and Minister without Portfolio Vandervelde disagreed and engaged in a heated debate. Vandervelde reportedly said, "I can accept any political system except fascism." Spaak immediately replied, "We must either support Fascist Rexist Party leader Degrelle or support the government. There is no other choice." Vandervelde then retorted, "If I had to choose between Fascism and Bolshevism, I would rather choose Bolshevism." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>French Radical Party Issues Declaration, Congress Concludes</h3>
<p>Biarritz - The Radical Socialist Party Congress, which lasted for four days, concluded at noon today with the singing of the national anthem. The final decision-making session this morning was purely focused on the internal organization of the party. At the closing ceremony, a congress declaration was read, summarizing the key points of the resolutions passed yesterday, namely: (1) the occupation of factories by workers must stop; (2) support for the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War; (3) a desire to restore budgetary balance; (4) unwavering commitment to the League of Nations covenant and alliances with other countries; (5) approval of the actions taken by the Radical Socialist Party members in the Popular Front cabinet. The majority of delegates at the congress expressed support for the resolutions and the declaration. Delegates opposed to the Communist Party believed that the congress had appropriately denounced the occupation of factories by workers and the Communist Party's advocacy of intervention in the Spanish Civil War, which was highly satisfactory. Those who supported the Popular Front stated that the congress had endorsed the actions taken by the Radical Socialist Party members in the cabinet, allowing those cabinet members to continue to cooperate with Prime Minister Léon Blum and the Socialist Party cabinet members. After the adjournment, a grand banquet was held. At the end of the banquet, party leader and Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a speech, stating that "All attempts by fascism have been eliminated due to the existence of the Popular Front. It would be absurd for our party to promote the breakup of the Popular Front at this time, but there can be no social justice if the entire nation cannot live together peacefully and respect order. And the Popular Front cannot succeed if it cannot protect the democratic interests of the entire nation. This is what our party should announce to the entire nation." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Parties Demonstrate, Expressing Three Trends</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - The government's Liberal Party, the opposition National Peasant Party, and the far-right Romanian Front held separate demonstrations yesterday, expressing three trends of public opinion. The main points of the speeches by key figures of each party are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) The Liberal Party held a gathering in Turnu Severin, where party leader and State Counselor Gheorghe Tătărescu delivered a speech, reiterating his support for the League of Nations and advocating for maintaining friendly relations with the Soviet Union, provided that the Soviet Union does not interfere in Romania's internal affairs.</p>
<p>(2) The National Peasant Party held a gathering in Chișinău, where party leader Iuliu Maniu and Secretary-General Virgil Madgearu spoke successively. Maniu advocated that Romania should conclude a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union. Madgearu advocated that Romania's alliance with France, Poland, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente countries should be further strengthened within the framework of the League of Nations. Romania's friendly relations with the Soviet Union should also be promoted, provided that the Soviet Union does not interfere in Romania's internal affairs. In addition, Romania's friendly relations with the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany should also be further enhanced.</p>
<p>(3) The far-right Romanian Front held a gathering in Craiova, where the Front's Secretary-General and former Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, Tira, delivered a speech, advocating that the government should find ways to limit the continued increase in the Jewish population. He also stated that the Romanian Front could not tolerate the possibility of communism using a future war in Central Europe as a pretext for the Soviet Union to enter Romania as a helper. Tira's views are shared by all far-right groups, as these groups are known for their sympathy towards Italian Fascism and German National Socialism. (Havas, 26th)</p>

It is reported that China, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Siam have all agreed to participate, while the Soviet Union has refused. This conference will also discuss immigration issues. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Paris to Saigon Air Race of 12,000 Miles; Three Take Off, One Returns</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The 13,000-mile air race from Paris to Saigon began today. Three planes participated. One, piloted by Charles and Brier, took off from Le Bourget Airport at 6:00 AM, but soon returned to repair the engine. It took off again at 8:33 AM and landed in Lyon at 4:25 PM, then flew to Turin. After arriving there, it decided to withdraw from the race due to a broken oil pipe. The other two planes, one piloted by Arnoux and Yobi, landed safely in Athens and then departed from Baghdad at 6:50 PM. Baghdad is a mandatory stop. The other, piloted by Testot-Troyat and Delmotte, was forced to land in Corinth due to a lack of fuel. Fortunately, the plane was not damaged. After refueling, it continued to fly to Tatoi and should arrive there tomorrow. The only other mandatory stop on the route is Karachi. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Among the aviators participating in the long-distance round-trip flight competition between Paris and Saigon, the Arnoux and Yobi team is currently in the lead, followed by the Testot-Troyat and Delmotte team. The Charles and Brier team has abandoned the race midway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Arnoux and Yabi team flew over Brindisi, Italy, at 3:05 PM and arrived in Greece at the Tatoi airfield at 3:40 PM. They stayed for one hour and ten minutes and resumed flying at 4:50 PM. By 8:10 PM, they had flown between Rhodes and Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The Testot-Troyat and Delmotte team flew over the Greek island of Corfu in the Mediterranean Sea at 1:05 PM and arrived at the Tatoi airfield at 3:05 PM. Later, due to running out of gasoline, they were forced to land near Corinth, Greece. They immediately reported to Paris by long-distance telephone, saying, "The weather was very bad when we flew over the Adriatic Sea. Thin ice formed on the wings, reducing our speed and delaying us for an hour and a half. Later, we ran out of gasoline and had to land near Corinth. We are now waiting for gasoline. If we can find it, we will continue flying tomorrow." Athens dispatched a truck full of gasoline to the landing site at 8:00 PM to supply Testot-Troyat and others.</p>
<p>The Charles and Brier team, after flying to Turin, Italy, had to fly back to Lyon, France, and land at 4:25 PM due to engine damage on the right side and were unable to continue flying. They decided to abandon the competition and will fly back to Paris tomorrow to repair the engine. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Details of the Assassination of Chairman Yang Yongtai of Hubei Province: Shot Twice, Died in Hospital; Assailant Apprehended on the Spot; Funeral Committee Formed to Handle Aftermath; Secretary Lu Zhu Acts as Chairman</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch, 25th - An assassination occurred in Hankou today. The victim was Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Hubei Province and Secretary-General of the Military Affairs Commission Chairman's Headquarters. He was shot twice and died of his wounds after 22 minutes. The assailant was apprehended on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Assassination on the Riverfront</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai, accompanied by his wife, crossed the Yangtze River from Wuchang to Hankou at 1:00 PM on the 25th to attend a banquet hosted by the American consul. After the banquet at 3:00 PM, he, his wife, and an attendant crossed the river back to the provincial government. Due to strong winds, the ferry could not operate, so they switched to the Wuhan ferry. At 3:15 PM, they arrived at Pier 1 in front of the Jianghan Customs House in Hankou in their private car number 488. As they alighted from the car, an assailant suddenly appeared and fired three shots at Yang's back. Yang was hit by two bullets, but remained conscious and tried to remain calm, intending to return to Wuchang. Supported by his wife, he boarded the car and was rushed to Tongren Hospital in Special District 1 for treatment. He arrived at the hospital at 3:27 PM. Yang was still able to get out of the car and speak. The hospital director, Fujita, and doctors examined him and found that two bullets had entered from the lower part of the right back between the shoulder blades, and one bullet had passed through the lower part of the right rib. One bullet remained in the upper part of the sixth rib. Two injections of cardiac stimulant were administered. However, due to the severity of the injuries, he died at 3:37 PM.</p>
<p>Assailant Apprehended on the Spot</p>
<p>The assailant was a young man. When Yang was shot, there was chaos on the riverfront. The police officer on duty apprehended the assailant. The assailant resisted. Pedestrians ran for cover. A stray bullet injured a woman. When the police officer on duty blew his whistle wildly, other police officers arrived and apprehended the assailant on the spot. He was initially detained at the 6th Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the Public Security Bureau, and then to the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, where Commander Chen Jicheng personally interrogated him. The assailant's name is Chen Xiechao, a native of Sichuan, 20 years old, residing in rooms 56 and 14 at the Jinghan Hotel in the French Concession. Today, he took a rickshaw from somewhere to the Jianghan Customs House, waited for about half an hour, and fired at Yang when he got out of the car. The assailant has been apprehended on the spot, and it is believed that further information will be readily obtained.</p>

<h3>Hubei Province Suffers Disaster in Forty-Seven Counties, Agricultural Losses Reach Ten Million "Dan," Autumn Drought Situation Severe</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year, various counties relied on rainfall for regulation, and both spring and autumn agricultural harvests and plantings were abundant. Since the beginning of autumn, for more than two months, there has been a severe drought with no rain, and autumn crops have withered. At the same time, reports of floods, wind disasters, and insect plagues have also been heard. The total losses due to disasters, according to available investigations, affect forty-seven counties. Among them, twenty-nine counties suffered from drought, five counties suffered from floods, twenty-three counties suffered from wind disasters, six counties suffered from pests and diseases, and ten counties suffered from other disasters. According to estimates by agricultural authorities, the affected area (in units of 100 "Shi Mu") is: wheat 81.923 "Mu," loss of 47.751 "Dan" (in units of 100 "Shi Dan"); barley 59.346 "Mu," loss of 31.721 "Dan"; peas 23.501 "Mu," loss of 13.768 "Dan"; broad beans 25.783 "Mu," loss of 24.418; oats 4 "Mu," loss of 0.001 "Dan," totaling 190.557 "Mu" with a loss of 117.659 "Dan" of agricultural products.

<h3>Soviet Ship Illegally Enters Magong Port, Japanese Navy Greatly Alarmed, Considering It Espionage, Taiwan Court Sentences Fine of 1,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Magong Military Port in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan is the central base for the Japanese Navy in Taiwan and the South Seas and is highly valued. From June of last year to February of this year, foreign ships have illegally entered the Magong fortress area seven times under the pretext of seeking shelter from the wind. The Japanese Navy considers this to be organized international espionage. However, the court's investigation and trial concluded that there was insufficient evidence of espionage, and only fines were imposed for violations of ship laws. In February of this year, after discussions between the Japanese Naval Ministry and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, it was announced that the opening of Magong Commercial Port would be abolished (Magong originally had separate commercial and military ports). On July 1st, the status of Magong as a foreign trade port was canceled, and foreign ships were absolutely prohibited from approaching Magong. Even domestic ships were not allowed to enter or leave, in order to completely prevent reconnaissance of the Magong Military Port. Unexpectedly, the Soviet ship "Tilik" (3,500 tons) departed from Nikolaev, European Russia, on June 28th, bound for Vladivostok in the Far East. After passing through Port Said, Aden, Colombo, and Singapore, it arrived at the Penghu Channel at 8:00 AM on August 16th. At 10:15 AM, at the location of 119 degrees 55 minutes East longitude and 23 degrees 378 minutes North latitude, it entered the Magong Military Port due to engine trouble, anchoring at Wukan Cape on Penghu Island, intruding into the fortress area by 1.9 nautical miles from the open sea. The Magong Naval Base Command immediately detained the ship and arrested the captain. Military police conducted a serious investigation, considering it an act of espionage. For a time, the Japanese naval community and Japanese residents in Taiwan were extremely agitated, calling it a "strange Soviet ship incident that threatened the Empire's national defense and shocked the world." This was because, after the closure of Magong Port, at a time of tense Russo-Japanese relations and Russia's plans to strengthen its Far East fleet, it attracted great attention from the Japanese. The case was then transferred to the Kaohsiung District Court for handling. As a result of the investigation, the captain was prosecuted, stating, "The defendant claimed to have entered to avoid a maritime accident due to engine failure and hull cracking. However, given the rising tide, switching engines and using the 'You Shu method' could have achieved its purpose without the need to anchor. Furthermore, there was the nearby open commercial port of Keelung, but the 'Tirak She' traveled backwards for several hours to enter the unopened Penghu, making the action very incomprehensible and suggesting espionage. At this time of international emergency, openly entering a known military port and fortress, we request a fine of 2,000 yuan and confiscation of the ship." After three public trials, the Soviet Consul-General in Kobe came to Taiwan to handle the case. The captain strongly denied any intention of espionage, and the Japanese lawyer hired to defend him also stated that it was only a violation of ship laws, and the so-called espionage was merely suspicion, with no sufficient evidence. On October 16th, the Kaohsiung District Court pronounced the verdict, finding the captain guilty of violating ship laws and "sentencing the captain to a fine of 1,500 yuan; if he cannot pay, he will be sentenced to 200 days of detention in lieu of the fine." The captain appeared satisfied in court, but did not state whether he would serve the sentence or appeal. If neither the prosecutor nor the defendant appeals, the incident can be concluded. However, the Japanese Navy remains indignant. (October 23rd)</p>

<p>To the esteemed recipients: This year, we are pleased to celebrate Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday, and the completion of national unification is also worth celebrating. Various places are enthusiastically purchasing airplanes to celebrate his birthday. The "Li Bao" newspaper has initiated the "Contributing One Day to the Country" movement. The purpose of this movement is for factories and shops to contribute a portion of their monthly business income, and for employees to contribute all of their daily salary income to the government for the purchase of airplanes to celebrate the birthday and enrich national defense. We believe that the establishment of a country in the world depends on national defense. With the recent advances in science and technology, and the daily renewal of weapons, all countries are striving to build their air forces. Our country is currently in a time of increasing foreign aggression and national crisis.

Therefore, this association expresses deep sympathy for the "One Day" movement initiated by the "Li Bao" newspaper and believes that this is the minimum expression of patriotism by the Chinese people and a touchstone of our patriotic hearts. We believe that your esteemed association, which is enthusiastic about patriotic movements, will have the same feeling about this.

<p>Liu Zhenhuan: After Mr. Liu Zhenhuan arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong a few days ago after receiving a telegram from Chairman Chiang, he originally planned to go to Nanjing immediately to meet with him. However, Chairman Chiang went to Shaanxi on official business, so he is still staying in Shanghai. He has been very busy with social engagements in recent days. It is now learned that Mr. Liu has decided to go to Nanjing first today or tomorrow to wait for the return of Chairman Chiang, as he is expected to return to Nanjing soon.</p>

<h3>Zhang Fakui Sends Troops to Suppress Scattered Bandits in Huizhou and Ningguo</h3>
<p>The counties in the Huizhou and Ningguo prefectures of Anhui Province were previously disturbed by bandits, who then split into smaller groups, causing widespread problems. The people there have suffered greatly from the bandits, living in misery and displacement. Ningguo is the hometown of Yang Hu, the commander of the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison, who is deeply concerned. He has repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to the military and political authorities of the province, selecting strong troops to suppress the bandits within a set time limit. At the same time, they must also pay attention to the suffering of the people and ensure that the troops sent to suppress the bandits show special care, so as to relieve the people from their suffering. It is heard that the border area suppression commander Zhang Fakui recently replied by telegram, saying that he is deeply concerned that the bandits will cause trouble to neighboring areas, so he sent Bao Gang to lead his troops to pursue and suppress them, and also increased the dispatch of Zhang's brigade of the 55th Division to lead his troops to rush to a certain place to intercept them, in order to annihilate them. However, the bandits are extremely cunning and take advantage of weakness, scattering in the Huizhou and Ningguo areas, hoping to occupy them for a long time. Now, the dispatched troops are still fighting hard to pursue them in the Huizhou and Ningguo prefectures.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Communities to Organize Tourist Groups to Return to China</h3>

A Central News Agency reporter recently learned from relevant sources that overseas Chinese in various places have expressed enthusiastic support for this plan and are currently in the process of organizing. Jin Ruishan, an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, recently sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to ask for instructions and will return to China in the near future to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Tao Baichuan Reports on His Inspection of Various European and American Countries at the Expanded Memorial Week at the City Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan, a standing committee member of the City Party Headquarters, went to the United States to study last year and visited various European and American countries. He returned to Shanghai last month. Mayor Wu specially convened officials from various bureaus at the City Government Auditorium yesterday to hold an expanded memorial week and invited Tao to report on his inspection. His report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>United States: Chairman, comrades, I went to the United States last year to study and achieved my lifelong wish. I also took the opportunity to travel to various European countries. I will report what I saw to you. I spent a longer time in the United States. As you know, the United States is the land of gold, but what I saw in the United States is completely different from the ideal land of gold. Everywhere in the United States, you can see idlers. Even in New York, there are beggars. This is indeed affected by the global economic recession. Among the 120 million people in the United States, there are 12 million unemployed, accounting for one-tenth, which is a serious situation. The government's method of helping the unemployed is either giving money or giving work. Therefore, the government's expenditure is very large. Last year, the federal government's budget was 4 billion US dollars, the state governments' budget was 2 billion US dollars, and the county and village governments' budget was 6 billion US dollars, totaling 12 billion US dollars in government expenses per year. China only has 900 million yuan per year. The source of government expenses, of course, comes from the people. Therefore, the average American bears 100 US dollars in government expenses per year. The land of gold has also begun to show signs of poverty. Moreover, because the US government helps the unemployed, it cannot assign people according to their abilities, so the political efficiency is very low. However, the efficiency of private enterprises such as factories and shops is very high.</p>
<p>England: After living in the United States for more than a year, I went to England. I felt that the political efficiency in England was higher than that in the United States, but the standard of living and the material enjoyment of the people were lower than in the United States. The British are quite able to do things step by step and seek truth from facts, unlike the Americans who like to reach for the sky and be startled by the distance. In the schools in the United States, sometimes very good school buildings or gardens are demolished and rebuilt. The reason for this is said to be that frequent demolition and construction can circulate wealth, so that architects, engineers, workers, and lumber mills and other factories have business to do. The United States does indeed burn or sink wheat into the sea in order to balance prices. England is quite able to save.</p>
<p>Denmark: From England to Denmark, Denmark gave me a deep impression. The Danish people are very happy and there are no thieves. Denmark has over 800,000 people, and there are only 900 policemen in the whole country, accounting for one in a thousand. Therefore, you cannot see policemen on the road. The reason for this is that the people live and work in peace and have no need for policemen. Shanghai's policemen account for 2%, and other countries also have at least 2%. The reason why Denmark has achieved this is due to the development of the cooperative system. There are no extremely rich or extremely poor classes. The people's lives are all above the level.</p>
<p>Sweden: The buildings of the Swedish city government are often magnificent and rare. Their cost is equivalent to 35 million Chinese currency. Construction took 12 years to complete and is the first in the world. However, the Swedish royal palace is not so magnificent. It is said that the city government's building is so great because it is a way to absorb the economy. Because it is the world's first, many tourists come to Sweden to visit the city government, so that the commercial center can be developed. Therefore, the merchants invested the most in the construction of the city government, which can attract tourists and attract business. It can be seen that the source of wealth is not necessarily the mining industry, the scenery is also one of the sources of wealth.</p>
<p>Finland: In Finland, it is rare to see asphalt roads and cement roads. Most of them are stone roads, because the country is very poor. However, among the European countries, only Greece and Finland, these two small countries, can repay the war debts to the United States every year. Therefore, they have a high position in the international community. In this world conference, when discussing the location for the next meeting, Finland also participated in the struggle. This is rare among the emerging countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia: In Leningrad, the Soviet customs inspection is very strict. You cannot bring books, and the money you carry with you must also be reported. The people's lives are very difficult, but they are very content. The Soviet workers' monthly income is only 140 rubles, which is not enough to buy a pair of leather shoes, but the workers say that they have social wages, such as schools, libraries, sports fields, etc. Especially the Red Army, supporting the Red Army is their biggest job. The power of propaganda is really great. I think the maintenance of a dictatorship requires at least four conditions: (1) military force, (2) a private party, (3) official propaganda, and (4) bestowing favors on people. The situation in Soviet Russia is also like this. Now, analyzing the people's lives in the world, there are four lines: (1) starvation line, (2) subsistence line, (3) savings line, (4) extravagance line. Some countries have the extravagance line and also the starvation line. Soviet Russia has nothing on the extravagance line and nothing on the starvation line. The people all have food to eat, because Soviet Russia's production is aimed at feeding the people.</p>
<p>Germany: From Poland to Germany, Germany is a country of air force nationalism, which is completely different from the United States. After Hitler came to power, he added a new association that "young people can resolve disputes through duels." Therefore, whoever has scars on their body is a hero. Girls mostly worship heroes. Elementary school students carry knives and swords, unlike the United States, where recruiting soldiers requires a large movement, making slides and projecting them to promote how pleasant life is as a soldier, but very few are willing to be soldiers.</p>
<p>France: The situation in France is different from the others. The society is full of luxurious phenomena. France's annual consumption of champagne reaches 50 million yuan, not including wine. Prostitutes, both private and public, are everywhere. Therefore, some people use two "W"s to describe France: Wine and Woman. Its licentiousness and enjoyment are rarely seen in other countries.</p>
<p>Italy: Italy is a country that is quite energetic and spirited. It is indeed a revitalizing country. Mussolini himself has no drawers on his desk, so as not to delay official business. Moreover, he collects the important official business every day and brings back the unfinished business the next day to warn the person in charge not to imprison official business. This can be seen from this. The people's patriotism is quite tense.</p>
<p>Conclusion: China's national revival can use two slogans: (1) Save it from the root, (2) Catch up from the front. Saving it from the root must start from people's training, economic development must start from the basics, and if we can catch up from the front, we will not be left behind. Therefore, the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang, as well as the National Economic Construction Movement, and quick action, practical work, and hard work are the ways to save the country. The New Life Movement is people's training, and the National Economic Construction Movement is seeking economic development, which is the way to save from the root. Quick action, practical work, and hard work are the methods to catch up from the front.</p>
<h3>The Factory Inspection Case is Pending, Continued Negotiations are Awaited. Re-discuss Compromise Based on Original Agreement, Adhering to the Principle of Not Harming Our National Sovereignty. The Ministry of Industry Has Submitted to the Executive Yuan Awaiting Approval.</h3>
<p>The factory inspection case in the Shanghai Concession has stalled due to objections raised by the Consular Body. The original draft agreement between the two parties has been effectively shelved. The City Government has reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry. According to a "Ta Kung Pao" reporter, the Ministry of Industry believes that the sovereignty of factory inspection belongs to our country. Regardless of the size of the factories established in the Chinese and concession areas, they must comply with the Factory Law and implement inspections to protect the safety of workers. Although the situation in the Shanghai Concession is special, Chinese workers make up the majority. The consular jurisdiction rights raised by the consular bodies of various countries are actually unnecessary to consider. The City Government has been recently requested to continue negotiations based on reason. After the City Government approves the request, it will order Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to propose further negotiations to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession at an opportune time. The original agreement can be negotiated and compromised under the principle of not losing our national sovereignty. However, the unreasonable demands from the consular bodies will never be conceded. Yu is preparing to meet with Stirling Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, to directly negotiate and resolve the matter as soon as possible. Now, the negotiations on the case are still centered on the two representatives, Yu and Fessenden.</p>
<p>Also, from Beijing news, the Ministry of Industry has submitted the revised Shanghai Concession Factory Inspection Agreement to the Executive Yuan for review. After approval, it will be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate with the Municipal Council based on the established principles.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee to End in Autumn Next Year, Over 700,000 Yuan in Uncollected Funds, Last Batch Due in September Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee was established last year at the request of the industrial and commercial circles and was jointly established by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the China National Products Bank, with a total capital of 5 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance appointed Cai Zengji and others as members to oversee the loan affairs. It has been over a year and four months since then. After passing the last batch of loans on the 3rd of last month, it was ordered by the ministry to stop handling them. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency system policy, and with the solid efforts of the banking industry, finance has been stabilized, and the monetary policy has gradually loosened. Banks and money shops have large sums of money to lend, so the committee is no longer necessary. According to a reporter, after the committee was established, it held monthly meetings to review and handle loan applications. The most applications were from textile factories. Others, such as those running small factories and shops, were more scattered. The committee stipulated very strict conditions, and the total amount of loans per household was also limited to 5,000 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of loans issued has only reached over 900,000 yuan. Apart from the 100,000 yuan that has been collected, the amount of loans currently issued is about 700,000 yuan. They will be collected on a monthly basis when they are due. When the last batch is due for collection in September next year, the committee will be dissolved.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Mourns Chen Fengqi, Funeral to be Held Today at China Funeral Home</h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation sent eight staff members to Germany last year to study flying, mechanical telecommunications, material management and other subjects. Chen Fengqi, one of the trainee pilots, unfortunately died in a plane crash in Germany on August 17 of this year. The company was greatly shocked by the news. In accordance with the request of the member's family, the remains will be returned to China, and a memorial service will be held at the China Funeral Home at 670 Haig Road at 3:00 PM today. In addition to all Chinese and foreign staff in Shanghai, the directors and all the relevant agencies of the Ministry of Communications stationed in Shanghai have also been invited to attend and give guidance. It is bound to be a sad occasion.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Run Out of Raw Materials, Shaoxing Silk Factory Stops Production, Zhejiang Unified Control Association's Spring Cocoons Difficult to Sell, Chinese Silk Prices Soar, Sales Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suffer from poor autumn cocoon harvests. Shanghai silk factories are running out of raw materials and have stopped production one after another. They are hoping that the Zhejiang Sericulture Unified Control Association will sell the spring cocoons in stock at a fair price. Exports of Chinese silk have turned smooth, and prices have soared. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Materials Are Exhausted</p>
<p>There are a total of 48 silk factories in the Zhabei, Nanshi, and concession areas of Shanghai, including Ewo, Jiyu, Hengcang, etc., with a total of 11,000 machines. Since the autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were poor, the Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory bought a large amount of leftover cocoons, resulting in a shortage of leftover cocoons on the market. The silk factories are all feeling panicked due to the lack of raw materials. The Shaoxing Silk Factory in Zhabei stopped production the day before yesterday due to the exhaustion of raw materials. As for the factories that are still operating, the maximum amount of raw materials is only enough for two months.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Cocoons Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>The silk factories are aware that stopping production due to the lack of raw materials affects the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers. They all hope that the Zhejiang Sericulture Unified Control Association will sell the spring cocoons it has collected to the Shanghai silk factories at a fair price, so that they can continue to operate and produce silk. However, the spring cocoons collected by the Zhejiang Sericulture Unified Control Association have already been managed by the silk reeling committee, which entrusted the Hangzhou Silk Factory and others to reel the silk, and the sales committee sold it overseas. Now it has been dumped in advance, so a fair price sale is unlikely to be achieved.</p>
<p>Silk Sales Turn Smooth</p>
<p>Chinese silk in the European and American markets had previously plummeted in price and sales were almost cut off due to the dumping of Japanese silk. Domestic silk factories' users have sharply reduced transactions due to the tense situation. Since last week, the prices of Chinese silk have soared abroad and now it is up to 1.73 US dollars, equivalent to about 690 yuan in national currency, and sales have turned smooth. Domestic silk factory users have increased sales compared to before because the rumors have subsided. As for the silk merchants in Shanghai, they do not dare to sell futures due to the lack of raw materials, fearing that they will not be able to deliver the goods at that time.</p>

<h3>The Banking and Financial Industries Complete the Study of Income Tax, To Be Submitted to the Executive Committee for Approval Before Being Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Adoption</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the extension of the interest income tax on deposits to start from New Year's Day next year, the Banking Association handed it over to the Banking Society for study, and the Money Industry Association formed a committee to study it. A reporter from the "New Voice" news agency learned yesterday from the Banking and Financial Industry Associations that the two industries have completed their studies. The banking industry has prepared opinions by the Banking Society, and the money industry has collected the opinions of various members through Feng Yigui, and the two secretaries of the two associations, Lin and Qin, have exchanged views. It is now decided to submit them to the Executive Committee for approval before submitting them to the Ministry of Finance for consideration, hoping to be adopted. Whether it is necessary to hold another joint meeting will be decided after the two associations hold separate executive committee meetings to discuss it.</p>

<h3>National Election Preliminary Elections Completed, People's Organizations Resume Re-elections, Central Civil Training Department Sent Letter to City Party Department for Review Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News, in order to strictly conduct the election of national representatives, the Central Government had previously issued an order to people's organizations in various places to temporarily suspend re-elections before the opening of the National Congress. This city has already complied with the order. Now, the Central Government believes that the National Congress has been postponed, and people's organizations in various places should resume re-elections in areas where the national election preliminary elections have been completed. Yesterday, the City Party Department of this city received a notice from the Central People's Training Department. The original letter is as follows: "It is found that the Ministry previously decided to temporarily suspend re-elections in all people's organizations in various places before the opening of the National Congress in order to strictly conduct the election of representatives, and a letter has been sent to you for review. Now, it is found that the Central Government has decided to postpone the National Congress, and the elections of people's organizations in various places should not be suspended for a long time. The methods decided by the Ministry are as follows: (1) People's organizations unrelated to the national election can be exempted from the restrictions of the previously issued methods; (2) For people's organizations related to the national election, re-elections are allowed to be resumed in provinces and districts where the preliminary elections have been completed, and re-elections should be resumed in provinces and districts where the preliminary elections have not been completed after they have been completed. In addition to separate letters, a corresponding letter is sent for your review and to inform them. To the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee."</p>
<h3>Zou Lin Requests to Reorganize the Currency and Finance of Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>Kong's Health Has Gradually Recovered</p>
<p>Staying in the Hospital for a Few Days for Further Recuperation</p>
<p>After the political situation in Guangxi Province stabilized, all facilities have been put on the right track. The troops that were transferred for defense have also been demobilized. The Guangxi Provincial authorities have repeatedly requested the Central Government and the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to Guangxi to reorganize the currency and finance of the province. It happened that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has been ill since last week, and on the advice of his doctor, he went to the Noel Hospital in western Shanghai for treatment. Due to high blood pressure, he should not disturb his brain power, so he declined to meet guests. All official duties in the ministry, except for particularly important ones that still need to be submitted to Kong for review, are handled by the two executives, Zou and Xu. Recently, according to the financial circles, the reorganization of Guangxi's currency and finance is extremely important. Although the主管员司 of the Ministry of Finance are planning methods, the method of implementation still needs to be instructed by Minister Kong himself. The other day, Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin came to Shanghai and visited Kong twice to ask for instructions. It is now learned that Minister Kong's health has gradually recovered after careful diagnosis and treatment by doctors. However, for the sake of further recuperation, he still needs to stay in the hospital for a few days, and will generally be able to leave the hospital around the end of the month to preside over important official duties.</p>
<h3>Various Qian Businesses Hold Cotton and Silk Mortgage Loans</h3>
<p>Separately Expand Warehouses and Stockyards</p>
<p>To Prepare for Stocking Mortgage Items</p>
<p>The member firms of the Shanghai Money Industry Association are now approaching the period before the tenth of the month for industry and commerce. Daily market prices are unusually stable. To open up more avenues and develop their businesses, these firms, in addition to continuing to handle credit loans as usual, have recently begun offering mortgage loans for commodities such as cotton and silkworm cocoons. Although this type of lending has not been decided upon through industry consultation, the intention to provide such loans is entirely consistent. A reporter from the Industrial News Agency learned from sources in the money industry that the firms previously offered mortgage loans for real estate. Later, they focused on credit loans and commodity mortgage loans. While they are not willing to slacken on credit loans, their focus has shifted to commodity mortgage loans. The firms' original warehouses and stockyards have now been increased or expanded separately to prepare for storing mortgage items. As for the loan interest rates, they are based on the length of the loan contract period. It is said that the firms are prepared to handle as much as possible around the tenth of the month, which can activate various industries and increase the financial leverage in the market.</p>
<h3>Ma Yinchu Discusses Improving the Bank Guarantee System</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, cases of embezzlement and fraud are very numerous in society nowadays. As reported recently, there are pursuit cases of embezzlement, fraud, and cheating at the American-China Bank, the Trust and Easy Trust Company, and the China Industrial Bank. This trend is growing daily. According to a certain statistician, there were 43 cases of fraud in the financial sector last year, amounting to more than 1.68 million yuan, which can be regarded as a serious social problem. When the famous economist Dr. Ma Yinchu met with a reporter, he expressed his feelings as follows: "The current guarantee system in China's professional circles has always used individual and shop guarantees. This type of system is not practical in many ways under the current complex social economy and has many drawbacks. After embezzlement cases occur, guarantors can rarely fulfill the original purpose of the guarantee compensation. To guarantee for others requires unlimited liability, and people are afraid to try, wanting to help but being burdened instead. Therefore, employees feel it is extremely difficult to find a guarantor. This is especially true in the banking sector. We have seen repeated cases of embezzlement and fraud being prosecuted over the years, and there is no way to curb them. Therefore, improving the guarantee system is the unanimous expectation of all sectors of society. However, how to improve it is a matter that requires much research. According to people in the financial sector, a certain bank has a proposal to abolish the current guarantee system and suggest a 'Special Cash Guarantee Method.' I recently saw the regulations, which use a considerable amount of cash as a guarantee and adopt the spirit of insurance, while also embodying the beauty of savings, consisting of three types of guarantee deposits (A, B, and C) and five principles: joint and several punishment, reward for reporting, and so on. This deposit contains the nature of a guarantee. If there is no embezzlement, it can still be returned. Its role is that all employees have a personal stake in it, which can encourage each other and eliminate the occurrence of bad events. This method embodies the spirit of group mutual assistance and cooperation, is more practical and reasonable than the simple guarantor system, and its meaning is worlds apart. It also complies with the scientific management of personnel. In modern times, all countries strive to improve the credit guarantee business and implement it practically. However, although the premiums paid by various institutions to domestic and foreign insurance companies for credit insurance are huge, they do not have a positive effect. I have observed that the 'Special Cash Guarantee Method' suggested by a certain bank, the Type A guarantee deposit is based on the British model, the Type B guarantee deposit is based on the American model, and the Type C guarantee deposit is based on China's situation. The entire method is roughly similar to the current guarantee system of the (National Provincial Bank Ltd, London) bank in England. The abolition of China's current bank guarantor system is undoubtedly necessary. However, reforming a certain system requires thorough research and then implementing it with a firm spirit, such as the government's abolition of taels and change of currency system, which are precedents. I sincerely hope that people in China's financial circles will pay attention to this issue and seek the best possible solution, implement it practically, or have one bank promote it alone, or several banks jointly handle it. Isn't it fortunate for both employees and guarantors?"</p>
<h3>Business Corps Chinese Team's 30th Camping and Shooting Competition</h3>
<p>Song Yue and Two Others Lead the Pack</p>
<p>Women's First Prize Goes to Wang Jincuifeng</p>
<p>Each team of the International Business Corps must hold a camping exercise once every year in the autumn and winter to conduct comprehensive training according to regulations. It is learned that this year's Chinese team's camping exercise was held at the Hongkou Shooting Range camp in the past two days. The enthusiasm of the people who came to the field was unprecedented in previous years. In addition to guard practice, strategic drills, and lectures on toxic gas and chemical warfare, the 30th Annual Shooting Competition and the qualified annual course shooting were also held. Although the autumn sun was scorching and the uniforms were soaked in sweat, the members were full of energy and courage, and the military appearance was solemn and the movements were neat, so the order was excellent. According to the results of the shooting competition in the past two days, Song Yue had the most total points, winning the championship of the whole team.

<h3>After Yang Yongtai was Assassinated, His Family Rushed to Mourn Yesterday and Today, Mayor Wu and Others Expressed Condolences, Eldest Daughter Flew to Hubei</h3>
<p>After Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was assassinated and died, his family in Shanghai, Yang's wife and daughter, Yi Xi, and others, were extremely saddened. Yang's Shanghai residence was originally at the bottom of Shigaota Road in the city, but recently, due to the current situation, he moved to the intersection of Lafayette Road and Baojian Road in the French Concession. Mrs. Yang and her three or four daughters took the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangshun ship at 12:00 last night to rush to Wuhan. Because the ship was slow, the eldest daughter, Yi Xi, will take a China Airlines plane at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow to rush to Wuhan first to preside over the funeral. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, and Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, went to Yang's residence at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday to express their condolences, advising Mrs. Yang to restrain her grief and assist in the important affairs, and telegraphed condolences to Hankou. According to Yang's eldest daughter, who spoke to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, she has not received any further calls from Wuhan about her father's death today, so the truth is still unknown. Cai Jingjun, Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, telegraphed condolences to Yang's family yesterday, saying, "To the Wife of Chairman Yang of the Wuchang Provincial Government, I am shocked and saddened to hear of Chairman Chang Gong's death. Chang Gong's achievements are as bright as the sun and stars. I hope you will restrain your grief and assist in the important affairs. I send my condolences by telegraph.

<h3>Shen Yiqian's Wife Died After Childbirth, Accuses Midwife of Negligence, Midwife States What Happened, The Case Has Been Tried and the Verdict Will be Announced on the 29th</h3>
<p>Shen Yiqian, a native of Wujiang who lives at 11, Lane 182, Tongfu Road, Public Concession, is 38 years old. His wife, Shen Zhuxiuzhen, gave birth to a girl on the 29th of last month. Xu Xiuying (36 years old), a female obstetrician from Changshu at 17, Dongchunhua Lane 59, Juberlais Road, French Concession, was hired to deliver the baby. On the fourth day after delivery, she suddenly developed a fever and chills and sought medical treatment. It was believed that Xu did not disinfect properly during delivery, causing bacteria to infect the uterus, turning into endometritis and peritonitis. She was sent to Tongde Hospital for treatment but was ineffective and died on the night of Double Ten Festival. Later, Shen Yiqian discovered that Xu Xiuying was a midwife who impersonated an obstetrician, published diagnostic examples, and also engaged in gynecology and smoking cessation. She was suspected of forging documents, fraudulently obtaining property, and not disinfecting the delivery surgery properly, causing the pregnant woman to become ill and die. He filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court against Xu Xiuying for forgery, fraud, and professional negligence resulting in death, requesting investigation. According to the complaint, the court yesterday summoned him to the Second Criminal Court by Judge Chen Shuoying. First, the plaintiff Shen Yiqian stated the intent of his complaint and presented a paper diagnostic example of the defendant printed in red paper impersonating a physician, requesting interrogation based on Article 215, Article 276, Paragraph 2, and Article 340 of the Criminal Law. The defendant Xu Xiuying arrived in court with her defense lawyer. She stated that the plaintiff's wife's delivery was introduced by the neighbor Shen Shuai's mother. She first registered on September 17 and paid 2 yuan. On the morning of the 28th, I went to deliver the baby and charged a total of 16 yuan for delivery and medicine. The mother and daughter were safe after delivery. I went to see her early every day, and there was nothing unusual. When I went to see her on the fourth morning, the pregnant woman said she had a fever and chills. I immediately said that I was a midwife, not a doctor, and that she should seek medical treatment from another doctor. The plaintiff did not listen and gave herself injections and enemas. Later, I introduced Dr. Wang Shuzhen to see her and told them to send her to the hospital quickly. I disinfected completely during delivery and was not negligent. As for the physician printed on the diagnostic examples, it was because there was a specialized physician at home to treat the illness. I am a midwife and did not impersonate a physician. She also presented a registration certificate from the Health Bureau and filed a counter-lawsuit accusing the plaintiff of slander. The court believed that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to be opened, and then announced the end, scheduling the verdict to be announced on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Pudong Water Plant Will Supply Water by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Water Pipeline Project Will Be Completed</p>
<p>In order to prosper the Pudong market and make it convenient for citizens to use water, the Municipal Industrial Trust Society has allocated funds to operate the Pudong Water Plant. Since the site near Youlong Wharf in Pudong was surveyed and the construction of the plant buildings was tendered last autumn, all the buildings of the new plant have been completed in the spring, and all internal machinery, water tanks, and other projects have also been arranged and completed. According to the original plan, water was originally planned to be opened for supply in September this year. However, because the streets of Pudong are curved and not straight, the underground water pipeline project was quite tortuous. Even many places had pipelines running into the households or the stratum of the warehouses. The trouble of the project was unparalleled. The society has invested heavily in the Pudong Water Plant, but as a municipal agency, the purpose is to facilitate the citizens. The unexpected losses will not be counted. Now the final project of burying the water pipes of the plant is about to be completed. The main and branch water pipes of each road will be connected to the main pipe of the water tank in the plant next month. Water supply will be opened no later than this year.</p>
<h3>Yuyuan Road Robbery</h3>

Everyone in the house was held captive and forced to hand over property. As a result, the robbers took two diamond rings and fled, worth more than 2,000 yuan. The victim reported to the police station and requested pursuit.</p>
<h3>Suspended Chinese Constable Yan Xingpei Suspected of Fraud and Obtaining Money, Arrested and Detained by Gordon Road Police Station, Yan Scammed in the Name of Seeking Opportunities for Others</h3>
<p>The General Inspectorate had suspended Chinese Constable No. 1966, Yan Xingpei (also known as Yan Xiangchen) from Anhui. He was arrested and detained by the Gordon Road Police Station a few days ago on suspicion of fraud and obtaining money. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law for the crime of fraud and obtaining money. Lawyer Qian also described the situation: The defendant Yan Xingpei used to be a Chinese constable and lived on the second floor of No. 875 Loulang Road in West Shanghai. His second landlord, Wang Liansheng, had a son named Shi Fa who was unemployed at home, so he asked the defendant to find him a job. The defendant took the opportunity to say that the Shanghai Brewery Company was currently in need of people and that he could recommend him, but that a "lobbying fee" of 20 yuan was required. Wang Liansheng, eager to find a job, paid the amount in full. Unexpectedly, after many days, there was no news. When Wang contacted Yan, Yan immediately returned the 30 yuan he had received in full. A few days later, the defendant suddenly claimed that he was now a translator in the Police Affairs Department of the General Inspectorate and that the Municipal Council was recruiting probationary constables and he could intercede on his behalf, but demanded a "lobbying fee" of 150 yuan. Wang agreed and said that it would be paid in three installments. Wang was short of money, so he borrowed 70 yuan from his friend Liu Caigui, and together with the previous 20 yuan for the brewery company, he made up 100 yuan. On March 13th and 16th of this year, he paid 50 yuan each time. The remaining 50 yuan would be paid after the matter was settled. On March 18th, the defendant suddenly moved elsewhere on some pretext. Although Wang repeatedly urged the defendant, he always avoided him. In May, Wang suddenly received a notice from the Municipal Council ordering him to go to the General Inspectorate writing room for an exam. The notice was stamped with the Municipal Council's seal. Wang was overjoyed, thinking that the job was done, and hurriedly asked the defendant. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly said that the letter was probably not genuine and suggested looking for another job. He said that he was familiar with a Westerner named Yin Sigui at the Shanghai Electric Army Company and could introduce him to a permanent position, but the result was another pie in the sky. At this point, Wang realized that the defendant was a con artist. It was not until yesterday that he caught him on the road and sent him to the police station. However, the defendant denied receiving 100 yuan at the police station, saying that he was being framed by Wang out of spite because Wang's mother had a relationship with a mutual friend. He requested a lawyer to come to court and request bail. Judge Pan Zhenyang ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing rescheduled for this Friday.</p>

<h3>Western Paint Industry Lawsuit, Witnesses Interrogated Yesterday, Landlord and Tenant Both Appeared in Court, Court Inquires About Purchase Books from Ten Years Ago</h3>
<p>Ma Shangjie, representative of the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Criminal Court against Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, Le Gengrong, and others for managing the property of the Yanghuo Commercial Association of Xinqiao Street. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Both parties were accompanied by lawyers Chao Kun, Gao Danhua, Yan Yinwu, Li Zuyu, Lin Yingqing, Zai Manyun, and Yuan Hanyun to the court. At 2:30 PM, Judge Chen Shuoying and clerk Wang Baoxun arrived at the Second Criminal Court for the trial. The plaintiff's side presented evidence regarding the Yanghuo Commercial Association's collection of rent and the shortage of rent recorded for the tenant, Xin Kang Coal Store. Witnesses were summoned. First, Han Zikang, the owner of the Xin Kang Coal Store from Shaoxing, was questioned and ordered to provide a witness bond. According to Han's testimony, he had no relationship with the four defendants, but only rented their houses. He took over the store at 94-96 Xinqiao Street twenty years ago, which was two rooms, and rented them directly from the Yanghuo Association. The rent was 38 yuan per room per month, totaling 76 yuan. He paid the rent monthly with a rent book. Previously, the rent was collected by Pan Baolin, the accountant of the association, and now it is collected by Feng Minzeng. The rent for September was paid with a check for 76 yuan from Defeng Paint Store. The official asked Han about the note added to the evidence presented by the plaintiff Ma Shangjie, which said, "This check was borrowed from Defeng." You said today that you received goods from the exchange, which is obviously incorrect. What kind of check did you receive, a payment for goods or a borrowed check? Han replied that he had dealings with Defeng, only ten or so yuan per month, and the rest was borrowed from Defeng. He rented the house directly, not indirectly, and so on. Then, Feng Minzeng, the rent collector of the Yanghuo Association, testified that he was in charge of collecting rent at the Renyi Shan Association. He took over in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The rent for Han Zikang's Xin Kang Coal Store was not collected by him. The house was rented to Zhu Zemin. He did not know when Zhu sublet it to Han. The rent was 56 yuan per month, sent by Zhang Shutang, with a rent ticket as proof. He presented a book of rent ticket stubs from January to September of this year for inspection. Zhang Shutang was also present in court today and could be summoned for questioning. The court immediately summoned Zhang Shutang, who testified that the houses at 94-96 Xinqiao Street were previously rented by his uncle Zhu Zemin. Zhu used to run a store himself, but due to the poor market and illness, he sublet the house to Han. There was a rent book. He was entrusted to collect the rent, 76 yuan per month. He paid 56 yuan to the landlord and held a rent ticket. At this point, he presented the rent book and rent ticket. He also said that he received a check for the rent in September and added more than 20 yuan to pay the landlord two months' rent. After examining the rent book, the court showed it to Han Zikang and asked if he paid the rent based on this book. After Han read it, he replied, "Yes." The official then asked, "The defendants ordered you to hand over the accounts, but you only submitted the account books for ten years starting from the fourteenth year. Where are the previous accounts?" Le Zhenbao replied that merchants, after receiving instructions, preserved account books for five years according to commercial practice. Now they have presented ten years. As for the previous accounts, they have to be checked. He couldn't say for sure if they were complete. At this point, the official ordered that Zhu Zemin, a witness, still needed to be summoned. The hearing was rescheduled for 3 PM on November 11th.</p>

<h3>Fire at Qianye Primary School, Damage in Half an Hour is Not Small, No Accidents as Students Had Not Arrived</h3>
<p>At about 8 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Qianye Primary School at the intersection of Wenjian Shi Road North and Henan Road. By the time it was discovered, it was beyond salvage. The Hongkou Fire Brigade received the news and immediately dispatched all firefighters and vehicles to put out the fire. Because the fire was raging, it was difficult to achieve results even after pouring water. Nearby residents were also greatly panicked, the noise was deafening, and the order was in chaos. Seeing that they could not support themselves alone, the Hongkou firefighters urgently reported to the Central Illegal Rescue Fire Brigade by telephone, urgently summoned fire trucks from various districts to dispatch separately, gathered around the fire field, and assisted in pouring water. After half an hour, the fire gradually subsided. As a result, all the school rooms were burned down, and the property was also lost a lot. Fortunately, no students had arrived at the school at the time, so there were no accidents. However, Firefighter No. 562 from the Hongkou District fell from the roof and was seriously injured due to carelessness when he bravely put out the fire during the fire. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment by car. The cause of the fire is currently being investigated by the police.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Extra Tips, This City Temporarily Suspended, Because the Market is Declining and the Situation is Special, It is Hoped That Labor and Management Will Automatically Rectify</h3>
<p>Dagong News reported that the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association had previously received an order from the General Association that taking extra tips in hotels, bathhouses, barbershops, restaurants, etc., was a bad habit and should be eliminated by formulating and implementing measures to ban extra tips. After receiving the order, the association believed that the situation in Shanghai was special and took a cautious approach. Considering the treatment of workers, it convened relevant parties several times for discussion, but there were no concrete results. The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association and others sent telegrams requesting a temporary suspension. The Dagong News reporter interviewed Jiang Hao, the secretary of the New Movement Association, yesterday. According to him, the crackdown on extra tips was originally intended to eliminate bad social habits and improve the personality of workers. However, the environment in this city is special. After repeated calls to representatives of labor and management from various agencies and industries, a careful implementation plan was developed. Now, the association believes that the market is declining and it is difficult for various industries to operate. If there is no appropriate protection for labor after the implementation of the ban, their livelihoods will be greatly affected. Therefore, it intends to submit a request to the General Association to temporarily not implement it in this city, or to allow labor and management in various industries to reform themselves. It is hoped that the capital side will adhere to the principle of small profits and quick turnover to effectively ban the extortion of tips, reduce the burden on customers, and emphasize social etiquette. It is also hoped that workers will respect their personality and no longer arbitrarily demand extra tips from customers. They must win the sympathy of customers with a respectful service spirit. The association will call relevant labor and management parties from various industries again in the coming days to earnestly persuade and faithfully implement this intention.</p>

<h3>Paying for Soda with a Bad Check, Valued at Over 10,000 Yuan and Uncollectible When Due, Sun Renjie Arrested by Miao Yide and Taken to the Police Station</h3>
<p>Sun Renjie, a man from Pudong, 40 years old, contacted Miao Yide, the accountant of the Tonghe Soda Company, the general distributor of Zheng Guanghe Soda Factory on Ningbo Road, in July of this year, and signed a contract to sell soda. He also established Datong Soda Company at No. 82 Guling Road. Up to September 5, he took away a total of 10,450 dozen sodas, valued at 11,551 yuan. Sun paid with seven checks from Pudong and Kenye Banks. When the checks were due, Miao could not collect the money, so he reported it to the Laozao Police Station. Detective Pang Ruiqing found that Sun had only deposited one or two hundred yuan in Pudong and Kenye Banks. He used the checks and then withdrew the remaining one or twenty yuan from the bank the next day. Therefore, the checks he paid to Miao were returned due to insufficient funds. The day before yesterday, Miao met Sun at the intersection of Chuqiao Road and Nanjing Road and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant confessed at the police station that he had sold some of the empty bottles to a man named Xu Naiwen, but there were still empty bottles worth more than 10,000 yuan that were unaccounted for. Therefore, he requested a postponement for investigation. When questioned, Sun Renjie confessed that he was the manager of Datong, contracted to sell soda with the plaintiff, and had a deed of 12,000 yuan and a business license as collateral. At that time, it was stipulated that each dozen would be 9 jiao, but the account was opened at 1 yuan per dozen. He had paid the plaintiff 1,000 yuan. Now, the market is bad, and it is difficult to collect accounts. It is even more difficult to collect all the empty bottles. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Pan Zhenyang reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>

The principal and interest were all paid off. Currently, there are still some account holders who have not collected their money, totaling less than 2,000 yuan. Although it has been continuously advertised in newspapers for many days to urge collection, a liquidation office is still set up at No. 255 Beijing Road Yeda Building to wait for sporadic account holders to withdraw this thousand yuan of principal and interest in order to end the matter. During the bank's prosperous period, when there was a financial panic in Shanghai, the total amount of deposits was about 8 million yuan.

Currently, there are still about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of real estate and secure assets that have not yet expired, which will be gradually returned to shareholders' capital.</p>

<h3>Arson Planned in Warehouse: Seven Russians Arrested; Large Fox Fur Valued at Over 400 Gold Coins Insured for a Huge Sum of 6,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In recent years, fires have occurred repeatedly in foreign warehouses storing goods in this city. The true cause of the fires has remained unknown. Although investigations were conducted, the results suggested arson, but no arsonists were ever apprehended. Until recently, under the strict investigation by Chief Detective Bai Naiduo, Russian Detective Bei Beining, Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming, Liu Shaoquan, Detectives Xie Futang, Zhang Fuquan, Yang Xiguang, etc. of the General Police Department, seven Russians were successively arrested on the 24th and 25th. It seemed that Ruodan was in the process of committing arson. Initially, Bin Liwei, a Russian in his sixties residing at 228 Hualong Road in the French Concession, purchased a large quantity of fox tails valued at about 450 yuan from the Pingjin area during the summer. He ostensibly consigned them to the Louise Moore Auction House for auction. On one hand, he colluded with accomplices to deliberately inflate the price before the auction to make goods valued at over 400 gold coins to be purchased at 6,000 yuan. At the time, the auction staff naturally did not suspect any ulterior motives, believing that the buyer must have a use for them, so they did not hesitate to spend heavily. In fact, Ruodan's purpose was to obtain a transaction price list given by Louise Moore. Immediately after obtaining this document, he turned to an insurance company to insure the goods according to the declared price. The insurance company, because the auction price of the goods was as high as 6,000 yuan, and their actual price should be more than 6,000 yuan, agreed to insure for 6,000 yuan. Ruodan then placed arson devices and various flammable liquids inside the cargo boxes, intending to store them at Longmao Foreign Firm's warehouse at 77 Guangdong Road on the 24th. Unexpectedly, his entire secret had been detected by Chinese and Western detectives. Therefore, on the morning of the 24th, they went together to the intersection of Lane 164, Long Road, which Ruodan had designated, to wait and watch. After waiting for a long time without any movement, they changed their location and went to Binli's place at 800 Xiafei Road. After waiting for a short time, they saw Bin Liwei coming. They followed him. In fact, he first entered 100 Shengmu Yuan Road for about an hour. Then, he went to 128 nearby to take out a large iron box and rode in a rickshaw to the back door of the residence of the Russian Keniler at 1228 Lafayette Road, placing the box at the door. He then took the original rickshaw to his residence at 228 Hualong Road, carried out a large hemp bag, and also transported it to the back door of Keniler's residence for temporary storage. Then he returned to his residence and carried out a rattan box. Later, Keniler transported these three boxes to the Longmao Foreign Firm's warehouse for storage. The Chinese and Western detectives who had been following all along arrested Keniler when he left the warehouse after finishing his business. At that time, Bin Liwei was waiting outside the warehouse door and was arrested at the same time. Subsequently, his accomplices Ao Peipan'er Sigan, Ma Jinggao Weisigan, Li Weisigan, Weisigan, Xi'er Xuhai were successively arrested at 6 Fanlong Road, Outside the Bund, 193 Xueshe Road, and a certain hotel in Ximo Road, 98 Hushan Road, etc. Items such as rubber tubes and empty bottles for liquids were found in each person's residence. The arson tools installed in the leather boxes containing fur were also taken out. Yesterday morning, including Bao Liwei and the other six, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Brigade Commander Qian Hongye conducted the preliminary interrogation. Ru Bao Yi, the lawyer representing the police department, briefly described the circumstances of the case, and requested an extension of the period for continued investigation, and then legally prosecuted after the conclusion of the investigation. Judge Qian then questioned the seven people one by one and ordered them to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<h3>Red Gao Slope Section of Jiujiang on the Shanghai-Hankou Line: Customs Has Prohibited Night Navigation; Downstream Vessels Prohibited from Sailing at Night; Upstream Vessels Should Stop to Give Way</h3>
<p>The decreasing water volume of the Yangtze River and the increasing difficulty of navigation on the Shanghai-Hankou line have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the Jianghai Customs that night navigation has been prohibited for downstream vessels in the Honggaopo (Red High Slope) waterway of the Jiujiang section. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Protecting Navigation Routes</p>
<p>The water levels along the downstream Shanghai to Hankou section continue to fall. The water level in Hankou has receded to within sixteen feet. The water levels at other ports such as Jiujiang, Anqing, and Wuhu are also decreasing daily, causing navigation to become increasingly dangerous in narrow channels and areas with rapid currents, especially for ships sailing downstream from Hankou to Shanghai. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Customs will provide navigation methods at any time as the situation requires, to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>Night Navigation Prohibited</p>
<p>The Honggaopo waterway in the Jiujiang section is one such situation. Therefore, the Customs has prohibited night navigation for downstream vessels, except for half an hour before sunrise and half an hour after sunset, when downstream vessels are allowed to pass. When upstream vessels encounter downstream vessels in the waterway, they should absolutely stay to the right side of the channel, temporarily stop moving forward, and only start moving after the downstream vessels have passed. The Customs has strictly ordered all Yangtze River steamers to pay close attention to the above navigation methods.</p>
<h3>Grand Wedding Ceremony at Huang's Garden</h3>

Important figures of the party and the state, such as Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang, as well as the ministers of various departments such as Yu Youren, Sun Zhesheng, Dai Jitao, and Ju Juesheng, sent scrolls and gifts. Major officials from remote provinces and borders such as Song Zheyuan, Ma Hongda, Han Fuqu, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and He Jian, as well as famous figures out of office such as Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, and Wu Peifu, all sent representatives to present gifts and congratulations. Therefore, the four teaching halls were decorated with a dazzling array of items. Representatives from all walks of life in this city who went to offer congratulations included Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Xiaotian, Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jinjun, Song Ziliang, Xu Fu, Zeng Yujun, Chen Aishi, Huang Yanpei, Chen Long, Xue Dubi, Liu Zhilu, Wang Boqi, Li Jue, Yu Qiaqing, Qu Yingguang, Wang Yintai, Song Hanzhang, Zhao Jinqing, Gu Xinyi, Wang Zhen, Mu Ouchu, Bei Runsheng, Lin Kanghou, Xu Xinliu, Li Fushun, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, among thousands of others. The scene was extremely grand and bustling. At 4 PM, the ceremonial guards and decorated sedan chairs arrived at the Huang family's garden auditorium. Immediately after, the wedding ceremony was held according to ancient rituals. When the ceremony began, pilots specially dispatched by the Aviation Association flew aircraft, soaring in the sky to perform various flight techniques to offer congratulations and scatter slogans and leaflets. For a time, confetti filled the sky and cheers resounded like thunder. In the evening, Peking opera was performed to entertain the guests.</p>

<h3>Qingpu Bus Station: Wooden Barriers Approved for Removal</h3>
<p>The Qinghu Bus Company has set up three wooden barriers at the Qingpu station, and vehicles from outside are required to pay a vehicle fee of five jiao (cents) if they want to enter the city. Fellow villagers who travel to Shanghai deeply disagree with this practice. Ni Zhuhua, Zhou Runan, Wang Zhongliang, and others have repeatedly filed complaints with the Construction Department, requesting that the wooden barriers be removed to facilitate transportation.

The department has vaccination vehicles that travel around the Eastern and Northern Districts one week and the Central and Western Districts the next. It has also published the addresses of various health branches for the convenience of residents seeking vaccinations nearby. However, regarding the address of the Fourth Branch in the Western District, the original address was 2360 Yuyuan Road, but it was mistakenly written as 136 Yuyuan Road, which should be corrected as soon as possible to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Electrical Manufacturing Industry Submits to Railway Department: Request to Revise Flashlight Freight Rates; Exempt From Special Light and Bulky Goods List; Charge Fees as Usual to Maintain Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that they are requesting the Ministry to quickly revise freight rates in order to maintain the transportation of domestic goods. According to a letter from the Huiming Battery Factory, a member of the association: "Regarding the new regulations on freight rates for light and bulky goods issued by the Ministry of Railways in Transportation Circular No. 8, flashlights are listed in the special light and bulky goods freight rate table, and fees are calculated by adding 50% to the actual weight. We believe that the new regulations have errors and hinder the sales of domestic goods. We should clarify this and request that the Ministry of Railways quickly reform the regulations to promote domestic goods. Our factory's production of Da Wuwei brand flashlights has been selling well in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Henan, and along the Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi lines. We have already received awards from the Ministry of Industry and the Shandong Provincial Construction Department, and the Ministry of Finance has granted us a tax exemption for exports. The annual production volume of these flashlights reaches more than 200,000 dozen, of which more than 90% are transported by rail. They are all packed in wooden boxes of 60 dozen each. The actual weight is 157 to 160 kilograms, and the volume is 68 cubic inches in height, 102 cubic inches in length, and 25 cubic inches in width, totaling 471 inches. The six-sided volume is 46. The combined weight is 157.216 kilograms. Before October 1st, the chargeable weight was 175 kilograms, which was not much different from the actual weight. Now they are listed in the special light and bulky goods list, and the calculation is based on adding 50% to the actual weight. This new regulation is actually flawed. According to the first provision of the new regulations on freight rates for light and bulky goods, 'Goods with a weight of one kilogram and a volume exceeding three cubic decimeters but not exceeding four cubic decimeters are considered ordinary light and bulky goods. Goods with a weight of one kilogram and a volume exceeding four cubic decimeters are considered special light and bulky goods.' The actual weight of our factory's flashlights is as described above, 157 to 160 kilograms per box. The calculated volume is 157.216 kilograms. In fact, the weight and volume are balanced and do not exceed the limit. Even if calculated according to 157 kilograms, the volume only exceeds 0.216 kilograms. If averaged per kilogram, the excess is even smaller. Even if calculated according to regulations, it should only be listed as ordinary light and bulky goods, with a fee calculated by adding 20% to the actual weight, and should not be listed in the special light and bulky goods list. In recent years, the flashlight industry has been facing the dumping of foreign goods and the threat of soaring raw material prices, while the selling price has been falling year by year due to weak purchasing power. They are struggling to survive in a precarious situation. Now that freight rates are affected again, costs are increasing, and sales are becoming more difficult. The interests of the future of the domestic goods industry are not superficial. Therefore, we have written this letter to explain our difficulties and request that you submit it to the Ministry of Railways to quickly reform the regulations and maintain the lifeline of the domestic goods industry." In response, we have submitted this report and earnestly request your Ministry to revise the freight rates for domestic flashlights, continue to charge fees as usual, and exempt them from being included in the special light and bulky goods category, in order to benefit the transportation of domestic goods, which would be a great favor.</p>

It was founded by prominent figures in the Shanghai business community, such as Mr. Liu Chunpu, Mr. Zhu Yongyuan, and Mr. Han Jingyang. The various products produced, such as Rhino brand synthetic rubber, gelatin, and gelatin powder, are made entirely from high-quality domestic raw materials and manufactured using the latest scientific methods. Therefore, they are even better than imported products. It is heard that the factory will open today (the 26th) and start business at the same time. In the past few days, many match factories and dyeing and weaving factories have been eagerly ordering products, which shows the excellence of the factory's products.</p>
<p>Crowded at Zhongfa Pharmacy</p>
<p>Since the launch of the autumn discount gift promotion by Zhongfa Pharmacy on October 20th, the pharmacy has been crowded with customers every day. The sales of various products have increased several times compared to normal. For example, Elephant brand malt essence cod liver oil and Double Lion brand beef juice and chicken juice are each sold for only 9 jiao and 9 fen (cents). Other cosmetics, such as children's face cream, tender face lotion, and Hundred Flowers face powder, are sold at prices lower than usual, and there are also daily necessities as gifts. No wonder the pharmacy is crowded with customers from morning till night.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing to clarify that our association has decided that the interest rate for a six-month fixed deposit is 5.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan deposited for 30 days, which is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 6.6%. Today, your esteemed newspaper misinterpreted this as 5.5 yuan of interest per 1,000 yuan deposited for six months, which is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 1.1%. This does not correspond to the facts. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction. We hope you will investigate and correct this matter. Sincerely, Shanghai Money Industry Association, October 26, 1936.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to the Shin Shi News Agency's news report in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper, which stated that Da Sheng Yarn Factory No. 1 is preparing to resume production. Our company's Factory No. 1 was established 40 years ago and has always been committed to improving domestic goods. Although the yarn industry has been in a slump for many years, we have continued to operate as usual. The report of the closure and resumption of production must be a rumor. We are writing to clarify this matter. We hope you will make a correction. Sincerely, Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company, February 26, 1936.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Aviation Association Plans to Hold Birthday Celebration Football Match</h3>
<p>Negotiations with Donghua and French Business Teams in Progress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aviation Association, in order to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday on the 31st of this month, plans to launch a birthday celebration football match. The date is scheduled for the 30th or 31st of this month. The participating teams are planned to be two strong Chinese and Western teams, Donghua and French Business. The Donghua side has already agreed. However, although a letter has been sent to the French Business Association to seek their consent, there has been no reply. If the French Business Association is unable to accept the invitation due to attending the league at that time, the Western Union Association will be consulted to make up for it, or other strong teams such as Lax or Guanjian will be invited to participate. The proceeds from ticket sales will be used solely for the continued purchase of aircraft. According to news, the Shanghai Aviation Association has sent letters to two excellent Chinese and Western football teams, Donghua and French Business, to participate in the birthday celebration football match in celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. It is now known that although contact has been made with Shen Yuan regarding the venue, no reply has been received yet. As for the date of the match, it has been decided to be held on Sunday (the 1st of next month). The ticket price is still being negotiated and is expected to be finalized on Thursday. It is noted that the birthday celebration match was originally scheduled to be held on the 30th or 31st, but according to the schedule announced yesterday by the Shanghai Football League, Donghua is on a bye that week, and will play against Portugal in the A-League on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Hard Court Tennis Tournament to Begin: Xu Lin Will Not Participate</h3>
<p>The 24th Hard Court Tennis Championship, organized by the French Business Association, will be held at the beginning of next month, with competitions in five categories including men's and women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles. Registration, which began some time ago, closed on the 25th (the day before yesterday). The competition is scheduled to begin on the 31st of this month. However, only a little more than 20 people have registered to participate, and only six or seven Chinese, including Ma Anquan and Li Pizu, have registered. It was previously rumored that national players Xu Chengji and Lin Shihua were planning to participate, but it is now known that this is not the case. It is noted that Xu Chengji, a Chinese Davis Cup player, departed from Mount Ying to return to China at the beginning of this month. Tan Jingjun recently received a telegram from Mr. Xu stating that he will arrive in Shanghai on the British Company's Kasaiqi mail ship on the 2nd of next month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Stadium's Industrial and Commercial Football Registration Deadline at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai First Stadium's Eighth Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Tournament began accepting registrations from old members on the 4th of this month, the majority of teams that participated in last year's competition and have not forfeited or been disqualified have been enthusiastically registering according to procedures. It is heard that the deadline for this registration is the 31st of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline or whose registration procedures are incomplete will be considered to have forfeited their membership. The association will supplement these memberships.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Lai Wah Cup</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th) In the Hong Kong Lai Wah Cup football match, Hua Lian versus the Army and Civil Servants versus the Navy were held simultaneously on the 25th. Hua Lian's formation was incomplete and supplemented with reserves, but they fought hard, resulting in a 3-3 draw. In the 20-minute overtime, Hua Lian narrowly won by one goal, eliminating the Army. Civil Servants also won against the Navy by 4-1, both securing the right to the final.</p>
<h3>Jin De Defeats Pei De by a Large Margin: 21 to 0</h3>
<p>The Jin De football team, which ranks high in the Morning League Group, won their first match by a large margin of 27 to 0 against Zhejiang Yu Ye Bank. In their second match in the morning, they met the Pei De team at Jiaozhou Park. Under the initial contact of both sides, the Jin De team's sharpness was overwhelming, and the Pei De team had no ability to fight back. They scored nine goals in the first half and twelve goals in the second half. Luo Douwen made the most contributions. As a result, Jin De won by a net score of 21 goals and returned. It is noted that the difference in football scores being so huge is truly rare in the football world. The strength of Jin De can be generally imagined. Goal-scoring records: Luo Douwen 9, Zhang Jinhai 4, Xu Jingcheng, Xu Buyun, and Gao Xiquan 2 goals each. Jin De's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Qinghui</p>
<p>Wu Zhenxiang Zhang Yinhai</p>
<p>Gu Jingchu Xu Jingcheng Xia Zhiming</p>
<p>Jiang Laishun Luo Douwen Xu Buyun Zhang Jinhai Gao Xiquan</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Stadium: Last Week's Results of Small Ball Games</h3>
<p>Grade Team Win/Loss Result</p>
<p>Hammering Zhong Fa Ren defeats Shen Bei 5 to 1</p>
<p>Divine Divine Light defeats Star Team 4 to 2</p>
<p>Work Miller defeats United Society 1 to 0</p>
<p>Leisure Hong Zai defeats Takahashi 4 to 1</p>
<p>Concluding Righteous Friends defeats New Rising 3 to 0</p>

<p>Hammering Righteousness defeats Diligence 5 to 1</p>
<p>Most Wheat Green defeats Zhong Fa 6 to 1</p>
<p>Most Sixty-Six defeats United North 4 to 1</p>
<p>Among them, the battle between New Rising and Righteous Friends of the Concluding Grade was quite important. Because the New Rising team had been winning consecutively, with only one draw, if they won yesterday's battle, they would have a good chance of winning the championship. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. From the beginning of the battle to the end of the match, they were controlled by Righteous Friends everywhere. The players, eager to win, exposed their crude weaknesses from time to time, resulting in two players being penalized one after another. Moreover, the linesman close to the team even interfered with the referee, which is even more regrettable. As a result, Righteous Friends won 3 to 0.</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Small Ball Championship: New New Wins Group A Championship</h3>

<h3>Reflections on Inspecting European Sports (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lianggui</p>
<p>(3) The Issue of Male Teachers Teaching Female Students</p>
<p>The so-called issue of male teachers teaching female students, 'Can male teachers teach female students or should they absolutely not?' When I was in China, I often heard high-sounding pronouncements from many women in the field of etiquette and education, and I saw many of their great works opposing male teachers teaching female students. Of course, we dare not say that they have any special purpose, but at least we think that they are somewhat acting rashly. Therefore, during this inspection, I paid close attention to this matter, and even wanted to take the opportunity to inquire about the situation in various European countries. Several female members of the inspection group raised the issue first. As a result, the answer each time was that in their countries, it is very common for men to teach female students, and most of the technical training is undertaken by men. When I was in Sweden, I specifically discussed this matter with my teacher, Mr. Zhang Huilan. As a result, we believed that men could teach female students, especially in technical aspects, which is easy to be effective, but in dance or gymnastics, women are more suitable. Originally, this was not a problem. The reasons why female comrades in China oppose male teachers teaching female students are:</p>
<p>A. Men do not understand the physiological conditions of female students.</p>
<p>B. Men cannot understand the psychology of female students.</p>
<p>In fact, these two reasons are untenable. As for the so-called physiological conditions, I think people who become physical education teachers certainly know them. The biggest difference between male and female physiology, apart from the difference in physical ability, is menstruation. Of course, during menstruation, female students are not suitable for strenuous activities except for very gentle activities. I think the so-called physiological condition of female students is this point. As for saying that female students are ashamed to inform male teachers of their periods, so male teachers cannot easily know, this situation may exist, but this kind of thinking is extremely wrong. Menstruation is a normal physiological phenomenon, and there is absolutely nothing to hide. For example, when the food in our stomach is completely digested, we feel hungry. This is the same phenomenon. When you are hungry, looking for food and menstruation are equally sacred things, so why hide it? As for psychology, I think it is a matter of people, not an entire factual problem. There are male teachers who do not understand the psychology of female students, and there are also female teachers who do not understand the psychology of female students.</p>
<p>(4) The Most Ideal Mass Sport</p>
<p>Today, the evaluation of sports activities in various European countries has reached a common and unanimous conclusion: After years of research, it is considered that the most beneficial for physical and mental health, and at the same time has educational, physiological, and military value, is swimming. Therefore, in several countries we have visited, such as Denmark, Germany, and Italy, swimming is designated as a compulsory course for schools at all levels. In the winter of 1935, the German Ministry of Education also issued the following decree: 'All elementary school students in the country must learn to swim. Those who do not know how to swim will not be allowed to graduate.' Germany is a country with compulsory education. Every citizen must go through a certain number of years of compulsory education. Therefore, it is planned that in ten years, all citizens born in 1925 will be able to swim. After this decree was issued, the government accelerated the training of a large number of swimming instructors to meet the urgent need. Denmark also has the same regulations. Although other countries do not have express regulations, they spare no effort to promote swimming. In Stockholm, Sweden, the government allocated a large amount of funds to train children to swim. Therefore, any city in various countries, no matter how big or small, has swimming pool buildings. At the same time, places with excellent natural environments, such as seashores and lakeside, are immediately set up with swimming pools. I have been to a small city in Germany called Marburg, with a population of only 20,000 people, and there are four swimming pools of various sizes, and there is also a warm water pool in winter. In fact, swimming is indeed 'the most ideal sport, and it is also economical. The daily consumption is extremely low, and it can also cultivate a kind of ability to cope with unexpected situations.' I hope that the sports bureaus and education bureaus of various cities in China will also formulate a ten-year plan, stipulate a kind of national game suitable for national conditions, no matter what kind of sport it is, as long as it meets the needs of the current Chinese situation, whether it is local or foreign, promote it as much as possible and implement it effectively. Doing this, I think, is more practical than spending millions of dollars to hold sports meetings. Fifteen years later, I dare to guarantee that the youth of the whole country will be able to become true new Chinese youth under a 'new model.'</p>
<p>(5) The Issue of the Transformation of Gymnastics Teaching Materials</p>
<p>(1) The Elimination of Footwork. Originally, this matter did not need to be mentioned again, but it has to be mentioned. As long as a few people who can think a little should understand that when attending physical education class, is it to ask students to specifically come one, two, one, march, or to ask them to spend a lot of energy to learn the changes in formations? This is extremely contrary to the principles of physical education. When I was in Shanghai, I visited the group gymnastics performance of the second Shanghai primary and secondary school sports meeting. What saddened me the most was that more than 90% of the schools still brought out that set of formation changes. Both teachers and students were extremely tired. I hope that the comrades who teach formation changes, let us think calmly, does this kind of one, two, one, marching teaching material have any effect on students? Does it have any impact? Undoubtedly, no one can answer. Then, this kind of teaching material is extremely unsuitable for children. Children are the life of the country. Our responsibility is to cultivate children. We must not mislead ourselves and others, and cause endless mistakes. During our visit, we visited several schools' physical education classes and never saw any teaching materials that used footwork. The most common thing is to do preparatory activities at the beginning of physical education class, using running. The types of running are different, and the methods are the same, but they can be fast or slow or changed to avoid being monotonous and lacking interest. After running, each sport begins.</p>
<p>(2) The Use of Music. Gymnastics and music are indeed very relevant, especially in girls and primary and secondary schools, because the harmonious rhythm of music, the ups and downs of tones, and the pleasant sounds of the piano all stimulate students' interest and reduce fatigue during exercise. In this regard, Europe has made the most of it.</p>
<p>(6) Youth Training and Children's Army</p>
<p>Youth training is one of the most important policies in various European countries, especially in Italy and Germany. The youth of the whole country, from childhood to adulthood, are given strict protection and guidance in terms of intellectual spirit, thought, and physical fitness, so that they become the most perfect citizens when they reach adulthood. In China, I think this is also an extremely important task. The biggest crisis in China at present is the decline of youth's physical fitness and the lack of knowledge. When China wants to implement this, it does not need to start a new organization, but can reform and expand the scope from the existing Chinese Practical Children's Army, not limited to students being able to join. All children of a certain age must join. Regarding this issue, I plan to write a more detailed and specific plan in the near future and discuss it with comrades.</p>
<p>Written in a rambling manner, the thoughts are not organized, and the text is not revised. Moreover, with a tube to spy on a leopard, what I see cannot be far away. I hope that the advanced people in China will give me corrections. I have too many feelings about this European tour. At the same time, every issue cannot be finished in a short time. In the future, when I have free time after class, I will slowly study with comrades. (September 30, 25th year, Berlin)</p>

In order to better protect the calligraphy and paintings and rare books from damage, the association has specially invited Mr. Sun Yituo, who has extensive experience in ancient books, to be responsible for the unrolling and rolling work of the calligraphy and paintings and handscrolls during the layout, and has entrusted Mr. Zhu Suixiang to introduce people to assist in the layout. In addition, strict storage regulations and visiting rules have been formulated during the exhibition period, and the Public Security Bureau has sent senior police officers to be stationed in the library to avoid negligence.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Fourth Year Financial Overview of Yenching University</h3>
<p>Needs Approximately 900,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Yenching University has released its financial overview for the twenty-fourth year as follows:</p>
<p>The school’s income and expenditure final accounts for the twenty-fourth year have been audited and finalized by Thomson &amp; Co. The complete report comprises more than forty tables, the contents of which are complex and difficult to grasp without detailed review. In order to make it clear for those who care about the school and easy to reference, a summary report has been compiled as follows. Although the school’s annual operating expenses have been streamlined and economized as much as possible over the past few years, it still requires approximately 900,000 yuan in national currency per year. Less than half of this amount comes from reliable, fixed sources. The majority is from temporary donations and subsidies from various parties. 1. The total revenue for the entire twenty-fourth year was 900,697.92 yuan in national currency. The sources are as follows: (1) Appropriation from the New York Board of Trustees, equivalent to 398,874.03 yuan in national currency, accounting for 44% of the total. (2) Subsidy from the Ministry of Education, 63,048.60 yuan, accounting for 7%. (3) Subsidy from the Rockefeller Foundation, 102,325.00 yuan, accounting for 11%. (4) Assistance from the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, 15,000.00 yuan, accounting for 2%. (5) Fees paid by students, 136,134.4 yuan, accounting for 15%. (6) Assistance from various Christian mission boards, 67,200.00 yuan, accounting for 8%. (7) Other income, 124,396.78 yuan, accounting for 13%. 2. The total expenditure for the entire twenty-fourth year was 871,432.68 yuan, allocated as follows: (1) Administrative expenses, 149,232.39 yuan, accounting for 17%. (2) Building maintenance expenses, 88,741.82 yuan, accounting for 10%. (3) School of Religion, 21,024.02 yuan, accounting for 2%. (4) College of Arts, 196,825.70 yuan, accounting for 23%. (5) College of Science, 151,311.61 yuan, accounting for 17%. (6) College of Law, 111,541.23 yuan, accounting for 13%. (7) Graduate Institute of Sinology, 104,585.97 yuan, accounting for 12%. (8) Other, 84,169.94 yuan, accounting for 6%. The surplus after offsetting income and expenditure is 35,546.24 yuan. This surplus is due to the fact that when preparing the budget for this year, the exchange rate between US dollars and national currency was assumed to be 1:2.25. After the National Government implemented the new currency policy in November of last year, the price of US dollars rose to over 3.3 yuan. Therefore, from November onwards, the school received over one yuan in legal tender for each US dollar compared to the budgeted figure, resulting in this unexpected surplus at the end of the year. This sum has now been separately deposited and used as a reserve for future exchange rate gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Unified Youth Cultivation (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ying Guan</p>
<p>(Educational Broadcast on September 8th)</p>
<p>Everyone realizes that middle school students today bear too heavy a learning burden. They are already overwhelmed with academic subjects, and they also have to practice various sports and exercises, participate in extracurricular activities, engage in labor service, attend large camps and grand reviews, etc. New tricks emerge endlessly, almost to the point of making a young person dizzy, exhausted, and hoarse, and yet it's still not over. This is the need of education in this era; lacking any one of these is unacceptable. However, is this truly the purpose of education?</p>
<p>No one can deny that today's youth are the future masters of the country. Because our nation has encountered unprecedented misfortune, the historical mission that we, on behalf of the people, bear for the nation is also unprecedentedly arduous. However, the age of junior high school students is still within childhood, and high school is only the early stage of youth. Their bodies and minds are developing and are very fragile, unable to withstand heavy workloads. Bearing arduous missions is a matter for the future, not something that can be immediately undertaken. Precisely because the future responsibility is great, current care for their physical and mental development should be even more meticulous. We absolutely cannot immediately push the ruined affairs of the nation, which predecessors and ourselves have messed up, entirely onto the youth, as if the debts owed by the elders and ourselves are immediately pushed onto the underage children, demanding that they repay them immediately. Where in the world is there such a ridiculous thing?</p>
<p>When youth encounter this time of inheriting great burdens and undertaking difficult tasks, amidst the complicated responsibilities, they should establish a unified method for cultivating knowledge, physique, and character in order to grasp the key points, handle them succinctly, and avoid being exhausted in coping and worn out in rushing around. This unified cultivation method can be divided into several aspects. First, the administrative organs in charge of education and all organizations responsible for leading youth often complain that the central government's decrees for youth education and training from various high-level competent authorities often conflict, making them difficult to comply with. To my knowledge, this situation has recently been addressed by close liaison between the central government's high-level competent authorities, striving to avoid duplication and contradiction in decrees. In the future, the local competent authorities responsible for youth education and training can also negotiate and establish effective liaison methods to ensure that the central government's unified decrees can be implemented thoroughly. At the same time, the local competent authorities should no longer have methods that conflict with central laws and regulations. Naturally, there are times when central laws and regulations need local supplementation, but the supplementation should not contain conflicting meanings. In short, all competent authorities should pay attention to the total amount of burden on the youth, that is, the daily working time and the amount of energy that an average young person should have. Before issuing any laws and regulations that increase the learning burden on youth, they should consider whether the time and energy of the youth can bear it. They cannot treat the youth as county magistrates in the administrative organization, where all upper-level authorities issue empty decrees demanding that the county comply, and the county magistrate deserves to die ten thousand times. If they were to comply with each and every decree, they truly would not be able to handle it and would have to ignore them all altogether. To be blunt, the youth do not have the rich experience of the county magistrates and do not know how to perfunctorily carry out orders. If you tell them to do this and that, they will truly do it, working themselves to exhaustion, both physically and mentally, without time to consider anything else.</p>
<p>Second, school administrative structures. Schools are the only important link between competent authorities at all levels and the youth. Their position can either improve or worsen the implementation of the upper-level authorities' decrees. In the past, most secondary schools were often ineffective in implementing laws and regulations, maintaining an attitude of seeking nothing but avoiding blame, perfunctorily dealing with matters. As a result of the rectification over the past few years, this phenomenon has undergone a complete reversal, that is, most schools have become somewhat eager for quick success. Regardless of the orders from any quarter, they immediately put them into operation without hesitation. As for whether various methods conflict, whether certain methods are useless or harmful, and how excessive or what the results of the implementation are, they have no time to consider. Only in this way is it considered diligence, in order to please everyone and even deliberately seek praise. They do not make practical efforts in the fundamental training of youth but think up scattered, diverse methods on the surface to drive youth into activity. In this way, to outsiders, not only is the implementation of laws and regulations considered effective, but there are also extra achievements. What honor this is! Pitifully, how many innocent youth are destroyed and sacrificed under this honor is unknown.</p>
<p>The situation described above is still the problem committed by some schools that want to please everyone and deliberately seek quick success. Now, let's cite a common malpractice that is easily committed by general schools. For example, physical education should naturally be compulsory and require all students to participate. However, the health of each young person should still be taken into account. If the body has a certain defect, certain sports should be exempted or a certain corrective exercise should be administered, or if the student is temporarily suffering from a certain disease, the entire or part of the sports should be temporarily suspended. These should all be closely monitored at all times. Active exercise is beyond reproach, but preventing abuses and oversights cannot be condoned. Facts tell us that many youth have contracted various serious diseases such as nephritis, scarlet fever, acute pneumonia, etc., due to participation in Boy Scout reviews, camping, and snow driving, before and after which the school neglected prevention. There are also many young people who have already suffered from serious illnesses such as heart failure, pulmonary tuberculosis, etc., but the authorities neglect to notice and still order them to continue participating in military training, resulting in death. In this case, the instructors and officers are naturally difficult to escape the blame, but even more to blame are the school administrators and the responsible personnel in charge of military training. Due to the disastrous defeat of our country's athletes in the recent World Games, it is inevitable that school sports must be stepped up in the future. At the same time, the occurrence of various dangers and diseases will also gradually increase. How to prevent and deal with them should be one of the special matters that school administration should pay special attention to in the future. Do not sacrifice a number of outstanding young people who can be accomplished in fields other than sports for nothing before there is any certainty of achieving scores in the next World Games.</p>
<p>In short, an enlightened secondary school principal and a sound school administrative structure should naturally implement the decrees of the upper-level authorities in a practical manner. At the same time, they should still not forget the broad goals of youth education and youth training, use their own thinking, and aim to maximize the benefits of implementation, reduce possible drawbacks to the lowest limit, not act perfunctorily, not eagerly seek fame, but actively and thoughtfully strive forward.</p>
<p>Third, the youth themselves. What has been said above is addressed to the various competent authorities and school administrative structures that educate and train the youth. Because in order to achieve unified youth cultivation, it is impossible to hope that the various competent authorities and schools will first have a unified training method. Although it is an external article, it is also the preface to this article. What follows will talk about the youth themselves, which can be said to be the main text of unified youth cultivation. It can also be divided into three levels. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Western Boys' School to Set Up Russian Class</h3>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Rumor of New Yarn Arrivals, Sharp Six Yuan Drop Marks Final Act of Yarn Market</h3>
<p>This month is the final act of the yarn market, with various parties determined to take delivery. There were rumors of a deal at 240 yuan. Unexpectedly, prices stagnated after being too high. Prices fell steadily in the afternoon, with the final price calling in at 230 yuan within the customs area. Bulls reluctantly provided support, closing at 231 yuan. Because there were widespread rumors of 1,000 bales of Shuanglu and Jinta brand new yarn arriving and Samsung's 50 sentences being old chips, the market price suddenly loosened, dropping sharply by 6 yuan, a sharp increase of 29 yuan and 3 jiao compared to last month's 201 yuan and 7 jiao. However, buyers for November delivery still had strong intentions.</p>
<p>Futures All Jump by One and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>The pre-market opening price for bid yarn for the current month was the last trading day. The market was calm. A certain gentleman prepared to take delivery. The first round fell slightly by 4 jiao, November fell by 9 jiao, December fell sharply by 1 yuan and 4 jiao, and the distant months fell by 1 jiao. In the second round, the current month stabilized, November and December suddenly rose by 1 yuan to 2 and a half yuan, and the distant months also rose by over 1 yuan. Many in the market said that the yarn markets in Qingdao and Tianjin were high, and that gang was dragging in bid yarn again, turning the market bullish. The prices for each month soared. At the same time, the spot yarn selling price rose again. The market remained good until the third close. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 1 yuan and 5, 6, and 8 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the current month, which fell by 5 jiao. The afternoon session heard that the current month was flat and weak, but the intention of the bulls in the distant months was strong, rising by 4 jiao. In the second round, it was heard that yarn sales were sluggish, and the current month suddenly fell by 1 and a half yuan, while the distant months remained flat. Until the third close, the current month fell sharply by 3 yuan, and the closing price fell again by 1 yuan. Because there were 1,050 bales of new yarn arriving, the distant months remained flat. Gengfeng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. They sold 1,650 bales of Juxing, 2,100 bales of Jinchang, 3,750 bales of Shenji, 2,400 bales of Taichang, 950 bales of Yichang, 900 bales of Xingchang, 1,300 bales of Shengyuan, 800 bales of Yiji, 900 bales of Senkang, 750 bales of Runkang, and 1,000 bales of Tonghe. They bought 3,500 bales from Wangtai, 1,000 bales from Hengyi, 1,150 bales from Changyu, 7,700 bales from Changjue, 650 bales from Yuda, and 950 bales from Tongfu. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn and Thread Each Rise by One or Two Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain flat. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 645 bales throughout the day. The selling price rose by 1 yuan, and thread rose by 2 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 445, Xuzhou: 10, Guangdong: 10</p>
<p>Nanjing: 10, Hankou: 10, Counterparts: 120</p>
<p>Yunnan: 20, Yanhubo: 15, Northern Gang: 5</p>
<h3>Origin Selling Prices Difficult to Loosen, Cotton Merchants Flip from Short to Long. How Can Foreign Cotton Prices Be Close?</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm, driven by the yarn market. In addition, general cotton merchants have flipped from short to long, and the prices at the origin have not loosened, so the intention to go long is very strong. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are falling step by step, and the price ratio is gradually approaching, so Japanese factories have the intention to take action. There are still many people who sell short when prices rise.</p>
<p>Bid Cotton is Flat in the Near Term, Up in the Distant Term</p>
<p>The pre-market opening price for bid cotton for October delivery was the last act. Although the shorts delivered in large quantities, general retail cotton merchants all took delivery, so the market situation rose again, up by 3 jiao. The distant months rose accordingly. After the second round, the situation continued to be good, but the overseas cotton market was very weak. According to cotton merchants, the selling prices at various locations are difficult to loosen. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 2 and a half to 3 and 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the current month was flat and weak, while the distant months were still high. After the second round, the distant months suddenly fell by 2 jiao, and then returned to the previous level at the third close. As a result, the current month fell by 3 jiao compared to the morning closing price, rising by 5 fen to 1 jiao. There were 30,000 dan of arbitrage for October delivery. Counterparts took in 30,000 dan. Changfeng bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. They sold 3,400 dan of Hengyi, 2,400 dan of Tonghe, 2,900 dan of Mingde, 2,100 dan of Yuanda, 4,700 dan of Xingchang, 4,100 dan of Changyu, 9,300 dan of Shenji, 8,700 dan of Taichang, 1,500 dan of Xiecheng, 4,000 dan of Dachang, 5,300 dan of Shengyuan, 2,500 dan of Xinchang, and 3,900 dan of Runkang. They bought 12,000 dan from Yuda, 1,900 dan from Chengji, 2,000 dan from Tongfu, 4,000 dan from Dafeng, 6,500 dan from Mingde, 2,200 dan from Heyu, 8,900 dan from Changfeng, 2,600 dan from Senkang, 9,800 dan from Wangtaixing, 6,500 dan from Yiyuan, 8,700 dan from Changhe, and 4,500 dan from Renfeng. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Need to Stop Operating. Spot cotton consumption is sluggish, and factory stomachs are blocked because Indian cotton calculation is getting closer and closer. The sources are 3,200 bales of Yaohua and 1,815 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Suining Cotton: 59.25, Yong'an Factory Intake: 110 pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Tezhangde: 9.70, Dasheng Factory Intake: 159 pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Delinted Cotton: 9.50, Dakang Factory Intake: 100 pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<h3>Wooden Frame Cotton Still Increasing</h3>
<p>——Survey on October 24th——</p>
<p>Cotton Name, Current Crop, Compared to Previous Crop</p>
<p>Hubei Fine Staple: 2,509 pieces, Decrease of 3,200 pieces</p>
<p>Yunnan Cotton: 9,042 pieces, Decrease of 603 pieces</p>

<p>Taicang Cotton: 1,959 bales——</p>
<p>Jiujiang Cotton: 519 bales, Decrease of 790 bales</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Customer Gang Transactions Decrease, Factory Delivery of Fancy Goods Still Very Busy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to be weak because actual sales suddenly stagnated and various goods gradually accumulated. Although there were no goods from Dong goods, the end of the month was the date for settlement, and the payment had to be advanced to empty the warehouses as usual, so a part of the bull customers urgently sought sales, causing the market price to fall (per piece) by about 1 jiao, consistent with the price drop of factory coarse cloth and coarse twill (per piece) by 1 jiao to 5 jiao. The price of 16-pound five-fu double elephant coarse cloth fell (per piece) by 4 jiao, the price of 14-pound blue chicken single deer fell (per piece) by 5 jiao, the price of 13-pound nine-day flying bear three horses fell (per piece) by 3 jiao, the price of 10-pound three rabbits, three deer, and three cats fell (per piece) by 1 jiao, the price of 9-pound five-fu cat eagle fell (per piece) by 3 jiao and a half. The factory's coarse cloth is mostly lacking stalls. The current selling price of 16-pound Hongfu Baoxing two brands is 11 yuan and 1 jiao, which is also a slight drop (per piece) of 4 jiao compared to the peak of last Thursday. Fancy goods such as velvet, straight tribute, and serge have also gradually fallen (per yard) by 5 li to 1 fen. Printed velvet continues to fall (per yard) by 1 fen due to the cheap sale of hand goods. In view of the continuous decline in prices, various customer gangs have unanimously reduced purchases and are eagerly trying to unload their inventory, so new transactions are increasingly bleak. The factory's delivery of white goods, fancy goods, and grey cloth is still very tense.</p>
<h3>Grains: Wheat Prices Do Not Loosen, Flour Market Still Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month showed an initial flat and continued rise. Because the quotations for foreign wheat had a difference of one or two jiao, the sentiment was still flat when the opening price was quoted. The opening price for the current month was only 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 and a half fen. November and December also appeared flat, but to January and below, because off-site sentiment saw that the reserves were not abundant and the grain prices in various locations continued to rise, the buying was very strong, so the opening price was good by one or two fen. Then, bulls in the industry returned to sell, and it was slightly weaker again. Until the afternoon opening, because the end-of-month settlement was approaching again, the shorts gradually entered, and the market sentiment turned firm. In the distant months, because the factory's hedging was quiet again and the spot wheat market has not yet loosened, the sentiment continued to be stable. People in the industry speculate that if the distribution in the north stops, the wheat market will inevitably be dragged down, and the flour market will gradually ease.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices in the North Step Up, Wheat Market Feels Increasingly Bullish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, although the foreign wheat had a rise and fall of one or two jiao, the grain prices in the north gradually soared. Furthermore, the recent weather is still clear and smooth, and the sentiment inside and outside the industry can't help but feel anxious. Therefore, the transactions in each month were stable and appeared to be good, which was better than the previous week's closing price by one or two fen. Until the opening in the afternoon, the sentiment in the near term was still stable due to the settlement relationship, but to January and below, because there were few customer hedges and the wheat reserves were increasingly empty, the sentiment felt even stronger, so the uplift was even more intense. According to this situation, the sentiment cannot be expected to fall unless it approaches foreign wheat. The spot wheat market is still stable. High wheat such as Shaheji and Yaowan wheat is still quoted at 6 yuan, and Hankou fine wheat is as high as 5 yuan and 7 jiao, deciding to 5 yuan and 3 jiao. The total market is estimated to be 18,000 to 19,000 bales.</p>
<h3>River Rice Still Relies on Northern Sales</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various gangs was slightly sparse than before, with a total of more than 40 numbers arriving, with a total of more than 8,000 shis of goods. The sales market in this street is still slack. Baowei, Tianjin, Xuyan, and other gangs bought nearly 2,000 bales of new thin rice, more than 1,000 bales of thick new japonica rice, and 100 to 200 bales of thin broken rice. Therefore, the market for thick new japonica rice turned soft and fell by 1 jiao. Kiln species and vegetable species are stable at high prices, while mid-section and Baekge, etc., depreciated by 5 fen. Su Tong Gang's Duyangjian has a better route, seeing show nearly a foot, while other gangs are soft. Thick broken japonica is flat and weak. The new Yinyuan is still sluggish, falling by an additional corner.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 40 to 50 numbers of various sources in the river. The market went to clear this street, Baowei continued to have distribution. New japonica Yangjian shouted up nearly a foot in the early market, and the later market settled. Broken japonica is flat and tired. Six species of dense species are not liked, and the price is short by a corner. Jiashan early price is a small one or two corners. The prices of Bu Jian, Ke Jian, and Du Jian are firm. Yinyiyuan is also stable and stagnant. Other rice is similar to before.</p>
<h3>Siping Street Soybean Fixed Goods are Numerous, Soybean Market is Depressed</h3>
<p>Northeast Dalian Siping Street soybeans officially opened on Sunday. Dealers ordered five cars for delivery in two weeks at a price of 5 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen. Yesterday, the market continued to trade five cars for delivery in November at a price of 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen, which were also ordered by dealers. Since the transport of Northeast soybeans began, sentiment has been visibly weak. Fortunately, the weather has been dry recently, and the market situation is still gathering. However, the Dalian soybean transaction has officially begun, and the market situation continues to report declines, so the market sentiment in this city has been greatly frustrated. Yesterday, the oil mill's stomach did not move. Only Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and this street made inquiries. The total market is estimated to have opened more than 2,800 bales of various soybeans. The market is high, flat, and second-class. The trend is divergent and temporarily cannot be grasped.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Spot Goods Are Extremely Popular</h3>
<p>It has been ten days since the new white tung oil was seen from the Zhejiang route. However, the arrival of goods was extremely slow due to the shallow water of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in the interruption of spot oil in Hangzhou. The price was still 49 yuan per dan a few days ago. Then, due to insufficient supply, it immediately increased to 50 yuan. Recently, it has increased again to 52 yuan, all of which are paid in Shanghai and can only be handled in one or twenty dan, and it is still necessary to have arrivals assigned as a number. Most of the new futures sold by various producing areas in the past cannot be delivered on time, resulting in the fact that oil companies in this city have no spot goods to sell, and the shortage of reserves is extremely rare. Foreign firms in the Hankou market also pay attention to futures oil and only handle spot oil as needed. Therefore, occasional transactions are in the minority. The prices are between 51 and 2 yuan, foreign regulations. Futures oil has been handled until January, and the price is between 48 and 9 yuan, with a total of 3,000 to 4,000 tons traded, and the amount handled by various foreign firms in various producing areas in Sichuan and Hunan provinces is not included.</p>
<h3>Narrow Strip Iron Spot Goods About to Run Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Since narrow strip iron has been purchased by cigarette factories, canning factories, etc., the market has become very active. However, new goods have not arrived, and existing stocks are extremely scarce, so that spot goods in the market are almost completely sold out. The market price for ordinary colors is 26 yuan per case, while the price for individual sales ranges from 22 to 29 yuan (due to different sizes). Yesterday, various can factories and toy factories were also buying, and the future trend seems to continue to be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Securities: In a Tug-of-War, Bond Market Shows Slight Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for October futures trading at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange. Market conditions were entirely passive, influenced by the back-and-forth between short and long positions. Although there wasn't a major storm of activity, there were still traces to be found. Category C stocks remained consistently bullish, reportedly driven by a single entity in the financial sector holding a large long position. Category A stocks were heavily shorted, with prices being driven up significantly each day. Given these uncertain circumstances, it's difficult to predict any real improvement in the market. Today, only November futures will be traded for one month, which could bring about more changes. Yesterday's session opened with a chaotic market, with ups and downs depending on the relationship between long and short hedging. For example, Category D stocks were squeezed higher by 3.5%, while Category B stocks were squeezed up by a smaller 2%. Each category behaved differently. In the secondary market, there was some buying interest, but long hedging continued. The difference between near and far-term contracts for Category D stocks was excessive, leading to some long hedging and arbitrage, showing a near-term decline and a far-term rise. Other categories were slightly better, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4%. After the afternoon opening, there was a general upward trend. Category A stocks were heavily shorted and rose another 0.4%, while the other categories remained balanced. At the close, the market returned to a chaotic state, with highs and lows intermingling, with only about 0.1% upward movement. The final market results showed that only Categories E and C stocks fell slightly by 0.1%, while all others rose, with Category A rising the most at 0.6%. The total trading volume was 10,035,000 yuan. The following is a comparative table of the results of the price changes: (Unit: Yuan, Trading Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Extremely Quiet, Short Positions Slightly Covered Mid-Session, Swap Rises to 2.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market started weak but strengthened later, with little activity in the middle, making it extremely quiet. Short positions were covered somewhat, resulting in a stable rise of 0.7%.

Exchange rates opened flat and closed slightly higher. The London spot gold price was unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates were flat for both the British pound and the US dollar, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The standard gold price remained at 1156.4 yuan. Pre-market trading opened lower at 56.5 yuan, but trading volume was light. When Wan Xing entered the market to buy, the price was immediately driven up, rising to over 7 yuan.

Spot dealers bought in slightly at the lower prices, causing a rebound. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted rates and the silver equalization tax were unchanged. The market then became extremely quiet, lacking movement and fluctuating only slightly until noon. The trend remained peaceful. The later market trend was initially weak but then stabilized, with major short players covering their positions. Sellers were scarce, and the market struggled to find counterparties, leading to a gradual rise.

The closing price rose to 1157.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, remained at 1156.4 yuan, about one yuan higher than the closing price.

The New York silver market was closed, and the forward silver price in Montreux remained unchanged across the board. The British pound against the US dollar was unchanged, the US dollar against the British pound rose 0.09375, and the US dollar against the French franc fell 1.5 pence.

Chinese merchants banks such as Shanghai rose while Guohua matched it. At noon, it remained sluggish. There were both buying and selling in the afternoon. The Japanese bank was suppressing it, but Dalian was still maintaining it. The Indian silver price initially rose one anna, then retreated slightly one anna a second time. The final result was still flat.

<h3>North-South Goods: Shantou Candied Tangerine Peels Rise Another Yuan or So</h3>
<p>The arrival of Shantou bridge peels has been scarce recently. More than a dozen pieces were continuously replenished the other day, and it was heard yesterday that they have been released. Because dealers need them, the supply cannot meet the demand, and the market is very good. Therefore, the opening price has risen by another yuan or so compared to before. According to news from the dealers, only a dozen pieces have been processed in the later batch, and the market price is not easy to ease.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Green Sugar Sales Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. The guild's planned price was 21.65 yuan for second-grade granulated sugar for immediate delivery, and 6.2 yuan for re-exported goods. The spot price for Dongbai No. 4 was 21.68 yuan, and the re-export price was 6.4 yuan. The spot price for No. 8 was a little more than 0.05 yuan, at 21.35 yuan, and the re-export price was 6.25 yuan. The spot price for No. 9 was 11.1 yuan, and the re-export price was 6 yuan. The price for No. 1 fine white sugar from local factories such as Zhen Ji, Jin Xin, and Da Hua was 20.5 yuan, and the prices for Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were discounted. Domestic Chaoqing and miscellaneous green sugars had slow sales, and the market was stagnant. After four rounds, the prices were not announced, and the trend was weak.</p>
<p>The joint company's sample exchange period was yesterday, the first time this week. The total quota for Guangdong sugar was 6765 bags. The bid price remained unchanged. 965 bags of coarse white sugar from the Shunde factory were sold at 21.5 yuan, 40 bags from the Shixin factory were sold at 21.3 yuan, and 20 bags from the Quxi factory were sold at 21.1 yuan. Another 100 bags were sold at 20.9 yuan, and 130 bags of medium granulated white sugar were sold at 19.4 yuan, for a total of 1255 bags.</p>
<h3>Metals: Pig Lead Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Although the trading volume of pig lead has not been high recently, the arrival of goods has been very small, and the inventory in Shanghai is low. Therefore, the holders of the goods have a very good mindset. The market quoted price yesterday was 0.5 yuan higher than before, selling at 26 yuan per dan. There were some transactions with the Sichuan gang and factories, with 200-300 strips reportedly being sold. Transactions on the organ side have been relatively deserted recently.</p>
<h3>Couplets from Twenty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— (Hu Junfu)</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, people in Shanghai held a grand and enthusiastic memorial meeting for the revolutionary martyrs who supported the revolution in the Gengzi year (1900). The meeting place was set up in Zhang Garden. The ink from songs and tears was like clouds. I wrote many couplets, the longest of which were two. One of them said: Who doesn't read the Spring and Autumn Annals? We are ashamed of you for your great righteousness. How can we recognize robbers as fathers? The heroic souls transform into hundreds of millions. Every drop of blood, every drop of tear, future generations will come, but there are no predecessors. From the long hells, we wave our hands to observe the chaos. To make the people prosperous, the revolution traces back to literary statements, which is in accordance with Heaven and the people. According to the rules of the world, don't ask about the past, present, and future. The wind is bleak, the rain is bleak, the wise men have knowledge, and freedom is immortal. Follow my ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, riding the dragon to Kunlun. Another couplet said: We, our ancestors, were born to support us, to this day, 4609 years. Lay the foundation for prosperity and create happiness for the common people. Tracing back to the first achievement, it was good to subdue the dragon and tame the lion, risking red blood and black iron to compensate for the price of all kinds of undertakings. Break the common view of life and death, experience countless kalpas, billions of kotis, and countless numbers. Present each soul, dedicate each body, covering the entire earth. Why sigh at the kylin and phoenix? Use heroic figures as special names for someone. Although the words are like people, the vigor is unparalleled. They are written on white silk more than ten feet long. The writer was Mr. Li Jingzhi, a calligrapher from my hometown, who has also passed away for a long time. A shorter couplet said: The situation creates heroes, and heroes create the situation. A man is not afraid of death, but afraid of not being a man. Also, my late friend Weng Jun Peifu wrote: The clouds and thunder are gathering, and you are suffering from their difficulties. Heaven and earth are being opened up, and we are coming to see its completion. The writing is concise, and the words are like casting, dignified like the person. Also, a couplet by my late friend Yun Tieqiao said: The country has no pigeons, or still hesitates at both ends. Alas! How can there be a revolution without bloodshed? Who is afraid of death? I only give way to you, saying: This is a hero who creates the situation. The words are sharp and like a historical discussion. Soon after, Yuan Shikai, when he was in power, gradually plotted to become emperor. The restrictions were very strict, and the whole country was fearful. At that time, I was depressed and unhappy. I happened to see a orchid exhibition in the local park, so I wrote a couplet: What era is this? My feelings are trustworthy. The upper and lower couplets only have eight characters, which is the shortest. Alas—the traitorous treaty that the whole country was unwilling to recognize, Yuan Shikai also planted the seeds of disaster at this time.</p>
<h3>Skipping Rope Examination</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>The game of skipping rope is quite loved by children. Especially when the weather is cold, whether in the home, at school, on small streets, or beside thoroughfares, you can often see those children in groups of three or five; counting one, two, three, four in their mouths, their legs jumping up and down, playing this game. Moreover, playing this game is simpler than kicking shuttlecock. Kicking shuttlecock still requires people to prepare a shuttlecock. Those who lack this tool often cause disputes and arguments due to envy and jealousy: only playing this skipping rope, as long as you find a rope at random, everyone can have fun for a while.</p>
<p>Skipping rope belongs to jumping exercise. It not only can make the foot muscles developed, but also can make the blood circulate throughout the body. At the same time, it can also cultivate children's neat habits and the concept of counting. Therefore, this game, like kicking shuttlecock, is beneficial to the body, and wise parents and elementary school teachers do not prohibit it.</p>
<p>Skipping rope and kicking shuttlecock are both children's games in the north, and their origins are also very ancient. Liu Tong of the Ming Dynasty quoted a common saying "willow tree dies, kick shuttlecock" in his "Dijing Wulue". Dijing is now Beijing. This is talking about kicking shuttlecock. As for skipping rope, it was already very popular in the Northern Qi Dynasty. "Book of Northern Qi, Post Lord Ji": "Children playing games like to hold a rope with both hands and sweep the ground and jump on their feet, and sing 'Gao Mo'." According to the "Book of Northern Qi", the founding of the Northern Qi Dynasty was in 1362 years before the Republic of China, and it ended in 1335. Based on this, the game of skipping rope has a history of nearly 1400 years. According to the "Book of Northern Qi", the way of playing skipping rope was the same as today; and singing "Gao Mo" while jumping is enough to show that children's psychology is competitive, and the past and the present are the same. Also, jumping and singing are enough to match the rhythm, and the lively feeling is also visible.</p>
<p>The origin of skipping rope that can be investigated is like this.</p>
<h3>Paper Cutting</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yun Su</p>
<p>Paper cutting is one of the professions of women, and they can also be regarded as street artists. Three-inch golden lilies, wearing embroidered shoes, six-inch round skin, also wearing embroidered shoes. The author recently interviewed two "paper cutting" women, one middle-aged woman and one young girl who is waiting to be married. The young girl was a little shy and I didn't chat with her. The middle-aged woman gave me some information: every woman loves to wear embroidered shoes, but without the pattern, she can't embroider them by hand. A tall building that stands in the clouds, no matter how magnificent it is, doesn't it first require the architect's design? A pair of bright and dripping embroidered shoes, a paper cutting pattern, is equivalent to the architect's design; women in inland cities love to wear embroidered shoes. In fact, although European styles are blowing in the cities, they still can't avoid a pair of embroidered shoes on their wedding night; there are many women's shoe rooms in Shanghai's small gardens, aren't they displaying pairs of dazzling and brilliant embroidered shoes? The women who cut paper patterns, I don't know who the ancestor was? But they have been passed down from generation to generation, and they don't teach this kind of cutting skill to outsiders. They register with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and it is a permanent patent; their sailboat is their home, and they regard the four seas as their home. Most of them are from Xinghua and Taixian in Jiangsu. Changzhou, Wuxi, Benniu, and Danyang in Jiangnan are their colonies; men repair umbrellas and kerosene lamps, and women cut paper patterns. They are not afraid of floods or droughts, and they don't suffer from unemployment. Everyone relies on their hands to buy food, enjoying the happiness of husband and wife singing in harmony; they often travel around, seeing and hearing a lot. They have an umbrella and a bag. We hear the sharp "paper cutting!" This kind of shouting is their way of attracting customers, like "peddlers"; an umbrella can resist the sun and rain, and a bag is like a "complete collection of books", which is also a miniature of the pattern room. Editor, scissors and paste, they use scissors and white paper. Although they have rough hands and dark skin, if you give them a pattern, they will cut it out accurately. When they encounter a girl who is about to get married, they are their only big customer; "rabbit watching the moon", "intertwined mandarin ducks", "lotus and lotus seeds", "butterflies flying through flowers" are all their masterpieces; when their business is good, they can earn five or six cents a day. Most of them are in groups of two, and when they meet a third or fourth colleague, they divide the income equally; they know that sailing in the same boat and mutual assistance are sacred rules.</p>
<h3>Swapped Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: High Brotherly Affection, Hiding Letters and Pitying Weak Sister, Strong Poetic and Scholarly Air, Peeping Shadows and Laughing at Poor Scholars</p>
<p>Youmei said: "Because in this summer, when there are no orchids, you still display things with the same name as orchids. When there are real orchids, how can you not like them?" Guoqi smiled slightly and nodded twice, only saying "Please sit, please sit." Youmei sat down on the rattan chair by the table. She turned her head casually and saw a piece of artificial rock in a porcelain pot, which was very exquisite and translucent. The green moss on it was half an inch long, and the small tree seedlings and fluffy fine grass were matched with small figures, which was quite interesting. Just as she was paying attention to it, she saw another square cattail pot next to the rock pot, with a letter pressed under the pot. The envelope was a thick, white, foreign-style one. There was a raised rose on the opposite side of the envelope's opening. Because the letter was facing upwards, there were no words on it. But Youmei had seen this kind of envelope in Menglan's study. According to her, this kind of envelope is not available in Beijing now; they are brought from Shanghai. Could it be such a coincidence that they were all brought from Shanghai? She thought like this, but she immediately became alert. How could she look at other people's secrets when visiting their house? So she picked up the plaster goddess and looked at it, laughing: "This house is very elegant, but adding such a statue is too fashionable and doesn't match these furnishings." Guoqi sat down on the rattan chair in the distance and laughed: "Many friends say the same thing when they see this thing. I explain it to everyone. This is an ancient Western myth. This female statue is the goddess of love, but unfortunately, she is oppressed by the god of misfortune and lost her freedom. Her name is Venus. Because her fate is very bitter, I find it has some poetic flavor, so I often put her on the table to help my writing." Youmei said: "So that's how it is. Why doesn't Cousin put the statue of the goddess of freedom on the table?" Guoqi laughed: "Do you think that present-day China can talk about any freedom?" When Youmei heard this, she put down the plaster statue and looked at Guoqi's face. She felt that his face had a layer of melancholy at that moment. (90)</p>
<h3>Folk Drama</h3>
<p>— Wu Yuquan</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures of Hollywood, USA, came to our country to shoot location shots for "The Good Earth." The places they went to are the places that many gentlemen who consider themselves to be of noble status do not care about or want to go to—like Tianqiao in Beijing and the "Three No-Man's Lands" in Tianjin. The materials collected for "The Good Earth" are also specifically from the "lower three lanes" to search, so it can be said that they have "deepened into the folk."</p>
<p>Many people who are concerned about Paramount's filming of "The Good Earth" in China believe that Paramount is not well-intentioned, so they focus on the inferior areas—like women's bound feet and men's queues—and demand that the government should supervise their selection and editing of materials.</p>
<p>We are not going to discuss whether Paramount Pictures originally intended to humiliate our national customs by filming "The Good Earth." In fact, like those folk entertainments, folk dramas, and all folk traditional customs and historical relics, there is much to be discovered everywhere, and it is indeed possible to learn about local customs and have research value. Isn't the domestic film company currently experiencing a shortage of scripts? Why don't they think of this, but let foreigners get there first!</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it is very meaningful and interesting to use folk literature as a subject and background to create a script that satirizes the times! The latest film "Xi Lin Men" by Yihua Film Company, directed by Huang Jiamo and Yue Feng, is based on folk customs and contains humorous, satirical, and comedic plots. It spares no effort in attacking authoritarian marriage. "Xi Lin Men" is currently being screened at the Xinguang Theater in Shanghai. Watching it will make you laugh. The screenwriter's idea is novel, and the protagonist, Miss Zhou Xuan, has a deep performance and contribution.</p>
<p>Brief News: Since the Shanghai-Beijing newspaper circles published the "Our Common Opinions and Beliefs in the Tense Sino-Japanese Relations," newspaper associations and journalist associations in various provinces and cities have also responded one after another, expressing their opinions. The Shanghai "International Literature Compilation and Editing Center" believes that the various declarations have considerable value for dissemination, so it has widely collected and compiled them into a book. In addition to the declaration, it includes editorials and several commentaries from the Japanese newspaper circle, totaling more than 30,000 words. The printing is exquisite and the binding is novel. It is reported that the museum, in addition to distributing it to national libraries, also plans to widely distribute it. Anyone who attaches a ten-point stamp and sends it to "No. 7, Lane 134, Kennihai Road, Shanghai," the museum will immediately send a copy for reference. (Ji character)</p>
<h3>New Bouncy Ball Talk</h3>
<p>— Huang Nanding</p>
<p>Ever since bouncy ball opera came to Shanghai, every amusement park has been decorated with bouncy ball opera, and it has reached its peak. In these few years, many bouncy ball opera troupes have come to Shanghai. As for those currently performing in Shanghai, there are: Xicailian at the Daxin Amusement Park, Furonghua at the Xinxin Garden, Zhangcailan at the Sincere Amusement Park, Zhu Baoxia at the Great World, Bai Yushuang at the Empire Theater, as well as Yu Lingzhi, Xiang Lingzhi, Ai Lianjun, Xiao Bai Yushuang, etc. However, Zhu Baoxia holds the record for bouncy ball opera in Shanghai, and Zhu Baoxia is currently the most popular. Since Zhu Baoxia came to Shanghai and performed at the New World Hotel, Shanghai people have begun to pay attention to bouncy ball opera. Recently, the bouncy ball opera with the best business at each amusement park is the Great World, which is almost always full. Therefore, the most popular and commendable bouncy ball opera in Shanghai is Zhu Baoxia's troupe, especially Baoxia and her sister Zixia.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of drama, if it only sticks to the original scripts and does not rehearse new dramas, it will never have lasting appeal. Especially bouncy ball opera, the original scripts are all crude and simple. Although there are a few better scripts, such as "Peach Blossom Temple," "Du Shiniang," and "Li Xianglian Selling Paintings," without creating new bouncy ball operas, it will not arouse the audience's interest. However, creating new dramas is not an easy task, and it requires experience in writing dramas, good teachers, and good materials. Bouncy ball opera has not been paid attention to for a long time, so it is naturally very difficult to find such talents. Now, Zhu Baoxia has obtained the guidance of the famous Peking Opera teacher Guan Hongbin, so the new dramas she performs cannot be compared to ordinary bouncy ball operas.</p>
<p>Among Zhu Baoxia's new dramas, the best one is "The Fox Spirit Fate." Zhu had also performed new dramas before, such as "Blood and Tears Tablet," "Sai Jinhua," and "Yu Tangchun," but none of them had as interesting and wonderful plots and tight scenes as "The Fox Spirit Fate." Because "The Fox Spirit Fate" script is very suitable for the conditions of drama. There are large sections of singing, delicate expressions, and all the supporting roles can fulfill their duties, especially Zhu Zixia, who has both sadness and happiness, which can make Baoxia have the effect of red flowers and green leaves. Moreover, Baoxia has a large section of erhuang singing in the script, and the tune is very similar to Chen Yanqiu, and her voice is loud and cloud-piercing, and can split metal and stone, making the whole drama more colorful. Therefore, since the premiere of the new drama "The Fox Spirit Fate," it has been widely praised, and Zhu Baoxia's artistic success has been further consolidated.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Insects</h3>
<p>— Tai Shang</p>
<p>Shanghai, this place is truly marvelous and unbelievably contradictory. You could say it has everything, or you could say it has nothing!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place that only consumes and doesn't produce. Such a large city can't even find a single authentic local product. Besides those spoiled sons of rich families, seductive women, and cunning merchants? Even everyday necessities like firewood, rice, oil, salt, fish, shrimp, and vegetables have to be imported from elsewhere. However, all the world's wealth is gathered in Shanghai, so the specialties of all places also converge here. As the saying goes, "Money can make the gods move." As long as you have money, unless it's a dragon's liver, a phoenix's marrow, or a mosquito's bone, things that don't exist in the human world, Shanghai has every other strange and precious item you could want. Even all kinds of rare birds and fierce beasts, and creatures from icy mountains and snowy seas, like tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, elephants, bears, orangutans, kangaroos, seals, sturgeons, etc., which are rare and hard to find in China, some people will go to great lengths to transport them from afar to display them in zoos and amusement parks. There are also performers from circuses like the "Haijing Bo Circus," who come from tens of thousands of miles away, sailing across the ocean to perform for us. This is all because "this master has plenty of money!"</p>
<p>However, the power of money sometimes has its limits. There are many extremely tiny and ordinary things that are rare and hard to find in Shanghai. Guess what these precious things are? Haha, they are the insignificant "insects"!</p>
<p>Originally, "wood rots, then insects are born." Insects mostly grow in damp and filthy places, hiding in forests and weeds. But Shanghai is full of nouveau riche, where "buildings are tall, trees are small, and everything is un-ancient." There are also regulations that require buildings to be rebuilt within a certain number of years, not allowing any dilapidated old buildings to exist. Furthermore, most of the residents live in "jewel box" style alleyway houses, where you can't see a single leaf when you look up, and you can't find a single blade of grass when you look down. So, where can insects find a place to breed and multiply? Moreover, the sanitation authorities have repeatedly emphasized cleanliness, equipped with new and sharp tools, and rigorously sweep away everything, making them even more "without remnant," and "unable to rest." As a result, things become valuable when they are rare. Like the crickets in Chancellor Jia's half-room, or Mr. Jia Huan's frogs in the Grand View Garden, or the cicadas silently standing in the corridors of temples, their remaining sounds dragging the country down with each branch. In Shanghai, they are actually as precious as white pigs from Liaodong, peddled from afar to "await a good price!"</p>
<p>The mainland has many pests, especially mosquitoes in the summer, which are as noisy as thunder and suck blood, acting like public enemies of humanity. West Lake can be called a summer resort, but it also suffers from having many large mosquitoes. Although it's not as bad as the "Laughing Forest Records" say, "Arriving at Yanziji in the morning, the mosquitoes are as big as chickens; staying overnight in the Wushan Gorge, the mosquitoes are bigger than ducks," (?) it's not much different from "Lu Jin Shrine." Therefore, places like Liu Zhuang, the lakeside houses are all equipped with special mosquito nets made of green gauze. Shanghai originally doesn't have many mosquitoes. The prosperous areas of the concession have no grasslands or "stagnant water" nearby, so you can spend the whole summer without needing a mosquito net, which is something that the mainland can never do.</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for nearly twenty years, and I think this is the only advantage of Shanghai, but when watching outdoor movies at the Dahua Hotel (?), this statement should be retracted!</p>

<h3>A Study of Germ Warfare (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>—A Special Report on the Eve of the World War</p>
<p>"Plague" is a general term for the practical result of germ warfare. It includes various infectious diseases. Each infectious disease is a molecule of the plague. The molecules are connected to form a plague. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot understand infectious diseases. When they encounter an infectious disease, they always use the term "plague." But a certain infectious disease has certain symptoms and signs (omitted here, please refer to special books). Regarding treatment, it is not very important in germ warfare. It is the same as ordinary treatment. The special point is that eradicating bacteria is the only guideline. The most important thing is to start with prevention, which is the most valuable thing. There are two principles that can be followed for methods of germ warfare defense that can be effective: (1) The responsibility borne by the state. Because the enemy uses germ warfare to attack us, all people in the country are harmed. It is not something that a certain province or a certain place can defend successfully. There must be defensive equipment and construction projects in the entire car so that it will not be threatened by the enemy and can strengthen its armed forces to defend the integrity of the country. (2) Training the people of the whole country to have a considerable understanding of germ warfare, organize epidemic prevention teams with epidemic prevention common sense to engage in epidemic prevention, so as to assist the country and strengthen prevention work.</p>
<p>In terms of personal defense practices, cultivate "daily life," "work and rest," dietary "cleanliness," and hygienic matters. How to maintain bone hygiene, how to maintain muscle hygiene? How to maintain the hygiene of the digestive, circulatory, respiratory, excretory, and sensory human body systems, so that the people of the whole country can obtain methods of personal hygiene and achieve a state of physical health. With a healthy national physique and an invigorated national spirit, they can resist diseases and bacterial attacks.</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of the property of the people of the whole country, human happiness, and avoid the harm of germ warfare, group prevention is the only effective method. It has been said above, and now it is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Port Quarantine and Transportation Hygiene Management: Cholera is also called "Tiger Cholera." China did not have this disease, but it was spread from India. The spread from place A to place B is entirely through transportation as a medium. Now, science is prosperous and transportation is developed, so there are more opportunities for spread. Therefore, transportation hygiene management and port quarantine are very important in preventing the plague. At customs entry and exit points, travelers are checked. If anyone is found to have a suspected disease or carrier, they must not move freely and must be quarantined. This can prevent the plague in place A from spreading to place B. This type of impediment work is an indispensable facility.</p>
<p>(2) Immune Testing and Preventive Injections: There are many diseases that can be avoided by engaging in prevention early, such as cholera, typhoid fever, diphtheria, tetanus, rabies, scarlet fever, meningitis...etc. Early preventive injections have a tendency to reduce the occurrence of disease and lower the mortality rate. But we still have many other diseases. Do we have resistance? We do not know. Therefore, we must carry out immune tests on a large scale so that we can know whether someone can develop resistance to a certain disease, or lacks resistance and is easily infected. Then, inject antibodies to increase their immunity, so that the people of the whole country can resist the transmission of viruses.</p>
<p>(3) Eradication of Rats, Flies, Mosquitoes, Bedbugs, etc.: The source of many plague diseases is entirely due to a certain parasite as a medium. For example, bedbugs are the medium for typhus and relapsing fever. Flies are the medium for cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. Mosquitoes are the medium for malaria and yellow fever. Rat fleas are an important medium for plague. Therefore, the whole country should unite to eradicate these parasites.</p>
<p>(4) Management of Feces and Ditches: Feces and ditches are the locations of dirty things and are the source of infectious diseases and the birthplace of plagues. China has always not paid attention to the facilities and management of feces and ditches, so the high mortality rate is not unrelated to this. Therefore, the improvement of toilets, the disposal of feces, and the construction of sewers can no longer be delayed, as they are related to the survival of the country!</p>
<p>There are also several other inspection tasks that must be carried out and are related to people's daily lives, listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Water Inspection: The most important thing for hygiene is drinking water. The relationship between water and people is the closest. If you don't pay attention to hygiene, infectious diseases are easily caused. Therefore, water must be inspected at any time. The taste, color, ingredients, etc. of water must be strictly inspected before it can be used. If it cannot be used, it should be banned immediately. If examined under a microscope, if there are more than 150 bacteria in one gram of water, it should never be drunk.</p>
<p>(2) Food Inspection: Humans rely on the power of food every day to nourish their physique, replenish their physical strength, and regulate their body temperature. Diet is indispensable in the living environment. Since food is so important, it must be inspected to see if it is corrupt, if germs are parasitic on it, what is the nutritional price, and what is the degree of digestion? It has a serious relationship with human life.</p>
<p>(3) Air Testing: Air and life are inseparable by even a fraction. If breathing cannot provide a sufficient amount in an instant, a person can die immediately from suffocation. Therefore, we must check whether the air is fresh, whether it contains toxins, and whether germs are parasitic. This is something that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Regarding the disinfection after the plague is transmitted, a brief description is given below:</p>
<p>(1) Patients - Patients with infectious diseases must take a full body bath and change clothes when cured. If it is impossible, wipe clean with a warm, damp cloth to replace the bath.</p>
<p>(2) Corpses - Corpses with infectious diseases are best cremated. If not, when putting them in a coffin, sprinkle or soak the bedding with mercury bichloride or carbolic acid, and then fill it with lime.</p>
<p>(3) Transporting Patients and Corpses - The ropes, poles, and bedding used to transport patients or corpses with infectious diseases must be wiped with mercury bichloride or carbolic acid each time.</p>
<p>(4) Toilets and Ditches - Vomit and excrement from infectious diseases must be disinfected. If dung is used for irrigation and fertilizer, it must be disinfected for one week before it can be used as fertilizer. The soil in the ditches should be irrigated with lime milk for disinfection.</p>
<p>(5) Households and Houses - The interior of the households and houses of those who have infectious diseases should be wiped clean with carbolic acid or mercury bichloride, and then sunlight should be allowed to enter to dry it.</p>
<p>(6) Clothes and Utensils - The clothes and bedding used by those who have infectious diseases should be washed clean with green soap or wiped clean with carbolic acid.</p>
<p>(7) Cars and Ships - Usually sprinkle with carbolic acid, and then disinfect the vomit and excrement of those who have infectious diseases.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that gas warfare is not to be feared, but germ warfare is an inhumane type of war. But in today's world, conscience is gone and justice is not obvious, so we can no longer ignore the study of germ warfare. The defense and construction of germ warfare should be the most important national policy in the rescue strategy to prevent emergencies. But we must not be overly afraid and trembling. In short, germ warfare is not easy to practice. Germ warfare will one day be practiced. Our only understanding is to prepare quickly! "Strengthening military power to protect the integrity of the country and seeking peace for the people of the world" is our current urgent plan!</p>
<h3>Soviet Medical Circle's Research on Higher Nervous Activity</h3>
<p>— Sound of Waves from Moscow</p>
<p>The research work of the Higher Nervous Activity Group of the All-Soviet Union Institute of Experimental Medicine includes all issues of nervous activity. From the early stages of embryonic tissue to the form of conditioned reflexes, the methods by which animals adapt to the external environment are all comprehensively covered. The basic question of its research work is the nervous activity organization related to the influence of surrounding activities. In short, this question involves central and peripheral nervous activity. Therefore, the research group has four laboratories: an Embryo Genetics Laboratory, an Experimental Neurology Laboratory, a Conditioned Reflex Laboratory, and a Morphology Laboratory.</p>
<p>The basic question of the first part of the research group's work is the extent to which the nerve center formed in the early stage of embryonic life is affected by the surrounding organs. This question is of particular significance because previous studies on nerve centers have believed that all components related to the nervous system before production are organizations that are rarely changed, especially for various parts of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>The experiment is carried out according to the following procedure:</p>
<p>In the early stage of embryonic development, the abdominal wall and uterus of the pregnant animal are cut open, and a brain incision is performed on the embryo to separate the various parts of the brain. After that, the uterus and abdominal wall are sutured and the pregnant animal continues its pregnancy life. After the operation, it takes about thirty to forty days for the embryo to reach its production. The first activity of this type of embryo in the external environment at the time of production is a very noteworthy thing.</p>
<p>If the operation is performed in the earliest stage, in most cases, the general activity of the newborn animal, its ability to develop conditioned reflexes, that is, its ability to adapt to the external environment, is very normal.</p>
<p>If the operation is performed in the later stage of life in the uterus, in most cases, the newborn animal has obvious defects at the time of production and it is difficult to adapt to its environment. For example, some animals lose the ability to move forward and can only retreat. Other animals can only stand in one place and jump up and down. Still others can only continue to rotate in one direction.</p>
<p>This type of newborn animal often loses the instinct to find its mother, but at the same time, it does not show any defects in other aspects. This type of newborn animal can stay by its mother's side for several hours without noticing or trying to breastfeed. The loss of this complex instinct is a definite sign of a change in the animal's general functional ability, but with long-term good care, it is still possible to return to normal completely.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing is that even if the operation is performed early and the performance of the newborn animal is very normal, abnormal distribution is often seen in the brain lobes when examined under a microscope.</p>
<p>The Higher Nervous Activity Research Group of the Soviet Union Institute of Experimental Medicine has performed this type of operation fifty times, most of which are studies of the situation after production.</p>
<p>The Role of Peripheral Organs</p>
<p>Regarding the role of peripheral organs, the conclusion of the experiment is as follows: The central nervous system is affected by the impulse of peripheral organs very early. Therefore, during this period, the tissue changes of the central nervous system, even if the organs have not yet formed their own nervous system, can be compensated by the slow impulse of the peripheral organs. In short, the impulse of the peripheral organs to the nerve center can make the already changed central nervous system form a normal functional relationship. This is the historical role of peripheral organs as the main builders of nervous tissue.</p>
<p>Therefore, this experiment again supports the basic point of view of the nervous activity research group.</p>
<p>The second part of the research group's work is about the experimental changes in the nerve center.</p>
<p>The main method of this work is to connect the peripheral organs with the nerve center, but not to make the peripheral organs belong to the nerve center. The completion of this type of work is due to the connection of nerve trunks, such as the vagus nerve, which is a nerve for the throat, heart, and intestines, to connect a nerve for the limbs. Then its normal relationship with the central nervous system is hindered. Thus, any stimulation of the front leg, each contraction of the muscle, is transmitted to another part of the central nervous system. The result of this connection can cause confusion in the central nervous system. For example, a dog has a coughing reaction to scratching its leg. The sudden sound when the muscles stretch can promote a lasting, stubborn vomiting performance. These phenomena can arouse the special interest of scientists. Long-term observation of these phenomena and their evolution can help us understand the permanence of certain nerve centers.</p>
<p>Research on Nerve Centers</p>
<p>In addition, the animal's reaction often depends on the condition of the nerve center. For example, the animal's leg begins to breathe with breathing</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Breathing, or with swallowing, shows all the complex actions of eating, etc. In this way, we can study the characteristics of each nerve center.</p>
<p>The research group further studied to try various different stimuli, especially paying attention to stimuli with profound physiological significance, and transferring the stimulation of the eye to the same nerve center as above. Therefore, the vagus nerve was sutured with the optic nerve and the sensory nerve of the eye. As a result, within four months, any slight contact of the cornea of the eye with a piece of paper provoked a strong cough, and eventually vomiting. Thus, we can see that the skin and cornea are stimulated, as if the stimulation directly reaches the vagus nerve center.</p>
<p>There is also a more sensitive surface for receiving stimuli, namely the mucous membrane.</p>
<p>For experiments transmitted from the mucous membrane, the surface of the tongue is often chosen. Therefore, the vagus nerve is sutured with all the tongue nerves in order to transfer the stimulation received by the tongue to the vagus nerve center, instead of reaching its original nerve center. As a result, coughing and vomiting were again provoked, which was the same as the phenomena of the above experiments.</p>
<p>There are many similar experiments, all different.</p>
<p>This kind of observation over several years is very important. From the experiment, we see the fixation of some nerve centers and the easy variability of other nerve centers. In some cases, the peripheral impulse is attached to the nerve center to rebuild its work. In other cases, on the contrary, the nerve center often strongly controls the organ (muscle) to work according to its own will for a long time.</p>
<p>These experiments have been done on hundreds of animals, allowing us to conclude that the general assumption that nerve centers are immutable based on the immutable characteristics seen in some specific nerve centers is wrong.</p>
<p>The main feature of this experiment is the change of the nerve center, and sometimes it is possible to tell in advance what kind of change will occur in the functional center.</p>
<p>The third part of the research group's work is the research of advanced nervous activity. The research method used is very special. There are two research methods. One is Pavlov's conditioned reflex method. This method has made many important achievements for the establishment of the theory of brain activity. In addition, there is a method of studying whole body actions, such as the method of the American behaviorist school. The research method of the group is to combine the above two methods into a new method. When experimenting with dogs using the Ba method, letting the dogs move freely, in addition to secreting saliva after receiving conditioned stimuli, the dogs also look around as if trying to find the source of the stimulation. Therefore, the experimenter also pays attention to the actions of the experimental animals at the same time, which can not only study in detail according to Ba's conditioned reflex, but also carefully examine the dog's actions.</p>
<p>The result of using this research method is that we can get a wide range of research on animal nerves. According to the research of this method, there are more than 20 scientific reports, and its future development is unlimited.</p>
<h3>More on the Problem of Blood Transfusion</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since I published "A Question of Blood Transfusion" in this journal, a few days later, a certain lawyer's reasons for requesting the Lawyers Association to transfer the explanation to the Ministry were published in this newspaper. I was originally unwilling to comment further, but because this matter is of great importance and is related to medicine, the medical profession, and social hearing, I hereby write this to challenge it.</p>
<p>The lawyer said: "According to Article 22 of the Criminal Law, legitimate acts in the course of business are not punished." The so-called legitimate acts, in terms of the medical profession, are the implementation of a legitimate operation on the patient himself when necessary... Blood transfusion is to save one person while harming another... It cannot be regarded as a legitimate act."</p>
<p>Difficult to say: "Whether blood transfusion is a legitimate act should depend on whether blood transfusion can cause harm. As for whether it can cause harm, it cannot be determined by empty words. There must be medical and clinical proof. Roughly speaking, the blood of ordinary strong people is as much as five or six liters, and each extraction is only a small amount of more than one hundred cubic centimeters. Extracting a hair from nine oxen will not damage the health of the blood donor. And in terms of clinical experience, the blood of the person being drawn is produced faster and supplemented more easily due to repeated extractions. Therefore, blood transfusion is actually a scientific therapy that uses the excess to make up for the deficiency, and there is no harm at all. Cutting off A's limbs to supplement B, or cutting off C's nose to give to D is indeed harmful behavior and cannot be compared with blood transfusion. However, since there is no harm, it is naturally a legitimate act and is undoubtedly among those that are not punished."</p>
<p>The lawyer said: "The criminal law recognizes the degree of crime based on the result when the implementation begins. As for whether it can be restored later, the law does not ask."</p>
<p>Difficult to say: The lawyer's words are in response to my previous article "The person being bled can recover after a little rest." The criminal law's so-called determination of the degree of crime based on the results at the time of implementation refers to those who knowingly start implementation knowing that the results are bad. As for the matter of blood transfusion, the doctor clearly knows that bleeding will not cause harm, and also knows that blood transfusion can have a curative effect. At the time of starting implementation, he already knew that it would be beneficial and harmless. How can it be called a crime? If the lawyer's words are to be believed, and blood transfusion is directly recognized as a criminal act, then the medical profession is bound by the law, and even the requests of benevolent fathers, filial sons, benevolent brothers, close relatives, religious people, and patriots can only be rejected and firmly refused. Why? Cannot agree to voluntary harm. This makes the filial watch the death of their relatives, the benevolent cherish the warm blood of sacrifice in vain, and traps the medical profession in enduring people. (End)</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(94) Chronic Articular Rheumatism</p>
<p>(Question) What is called Chronic Articular Rheumatism?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is like acute articular rheumatism (see 59), also a type of polyarthritis, but progresses very slowly.</p>
<p>(Question) How does this disease occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) Some are secondary to acute polyarthritis, some develop chronically and progress latently from the beginning, and some are caused by other diseases. Such as syphilitic chronic arthritis, gonorrheal chronic arthritis, or tuberculous chronic arthritis, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any relationship between this chronic articular rheumatism and gender?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is more likely to occur in women.</p>
<p>(Question) Does it occur in children?</p>
<p>(Answer) Rarely. However, symmetrical joint swelling in children, accompanied by swelling of the lymph glands and spleen, is a dangerous type of septicemia, specifically called Still's disease.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of chronic articular rheumatism?</p>
<p>(Answer) The main symptom is affecting the small joints, with pain during movement or pressure: there is a feeling of stiffness in the joints upon waking up. If forced to move, there will be cracking or grating sounds. This pain and stiffness are related to the weather and will worsen during the rainy season.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there any abnormalities in the appearance of joints affected by chronic articular rheumatism?</p>
<p>(Answer) They mostly become deformed. The hand develops spindle-shaped swelling at the metacarpal and phalangeal joints. The second phalanx bends like a dislocation, turning towards the back of the hand and bending outwards. The first phalanx often assumes an overextended position. The bones and muscles become atrophied.</p>
<p>(Question) What condition does the skin of the affected area exhibit?</p>
<p>(Answer) The skin above the affected joint is smooth like it has been painted, with a glossy appearance, and sometimes pigmentation occurs.</p>
<p>(Question) How is it treated?</p>
<p>(Answer) For chronic articular rheumatism, the first step is to find the cause and treat the underlying disease. It is essential to pay attention to dry living conditions and eat easily digestible foods. As for treating the disease itself, it can be divided into drug therapy, local therapy, and hot spring therapy.</p>
<p>(Question) What is drug therapy like?</p>
<p>(Answer) First, use a small amount of salicylate preparations for several days to relieve pain. Atophan is also effective; also, take iodine preparations and arsenic preparations internally.</p>
<p>(Question) What is local therapy like?</p>
<p>(Answer) Apply camphor liniment or iodine tincture, or salicylate application, alcohol compress. Perform hot steam baths, electric hot baths, warm compresses, artificial sun lamp irradiation, diathermy, and congestion therapy on the joint area.</p>
<p>(Question) What about hot spring baths?</p>
<p>(Answer) Simple spring water, or carbonic acid springs, sulfur springs, etc., are all acceptable. If these are effective, then perform warm river baths, radioactive mineral springs and other therapies.</p>
<h3>Hygiene Common Sense of Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Diseases (104) Olfaction</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>Our nasal cavity generally has three functions: breathing, olfaction, and assisting in the formation of speech. Therefore, if a disease occurs in the nasal cavity or the whole body, these three functions can be affected or obstructed sequentially. Now, let me briefly talk about olfaction.</p>
<p>The function of human olfactory organs is slightly weaker compared to the functions of other five senses. This is because it has fallen into a state of degeneration. Therefore, our sense of smell is not very sharp. Conversely, for example, mammals such as dogs, cats, and rats have particularly developed senses of smell. Therefore, dogs can explore their urine traces to know the route. Furthermore, police dogs can be trained to help police officers search for the tracks of thieves. These facts and successes are all due to the use of their keen sense of smell. Returning to the topic, the olfactory part of the human nasal mucosa exists in the mucosa of the superior and middle turbinates and the nasal septum mucosa opposite these two parts. A type of olfactory cell is distributed on this type of mucosa. If the odorant from the outside flows into the nasal cavity and invades the mucosa, then the odorant can stimulate the olfactory cells and cause odor perception. The strength of olfaction can be checked with the olfactory meter invented by Zwaardemaker to determine the size of olfactory power. Generally, in medicine, abnormalities in olfaction are collectively referred to as olfactory disorders. There are mainly four olfactory disorders: (1) hyperosmia, (2) hyposmia, (3) anosmia, and (4) dysosmia.</p>
<p>(1) Hyperosmia—is when the sense of smell is stronger than usual. It often occurs during hysteria, neurasthenia, menstruation, and pregnancy.</p>
<p>(2) Hyposmia—is when the sense of smell is weaker than usual.</p>
<p>(3) Anosmia—is when the sense of smell has become paralyzed. The causes of the above two types of olfactory disorders can be divided into central, respiratory, and true types. The central cause often occurs in brain diseases. The respiratory cause often occurs in nasal diseases, upper respiratory tract diseases, and lung diseases. The true cause often occurs in abnormalities of the olfactory nerve.</p>
<p>(4) Dysosmia—there are two types. One type is misidentifying the sense of smell containing a certain odorant as the sense of smell of another odorant. For example, smelling a fragrant odor and thinking it is a sour taste, or even thinking it is an unpleasant foul odor. This is called parosmia. One type is perceiving a certain odor even when there is no odorant present. This is called olfactory hallucination. These dysosmias are often seen in hysteria, neurasthenia, latent sinusitis, foreign bodies, and malignant tumors.</p>
<p>If you suffer from an olfactory disorder, you should immediately explore the underlying disease and treat it. Otherwise, it is often difficult to be effective.</p>
<h3>On Rickettsia and Rickettsial Diseases (5)</h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbai</p>
<p>When the rash initially appears, the systemic symptoms worsen accordingly, breathing also becomes difficult, the mind suddenly becomes blurred, the hands and feet twitch from time to time, and delirium occurs. The pulse rate increases dramatically, bowel movements become constipated, and urine becomes red and dark. If the condition takes a turn for the worse, then at the end of the second week, the patient, in a state of unconsciousness, may lose his life due to cardiac paralysis. The drop in temperature is usually rapid after two weeks. Urtsich suddenly drops from 40 degrees to normal body temperature within two or three days. It is also a common occurrence to have a sudden spike in temperature before or after the drop. At this time, the patient is tired and sleepy. After waking up, the mind is clear, as if waking up from a big dream. The recovery period is relatively short. Pneumonia is the most worrisome complication, and gangrene at the return site is also feared. The mortality rate of this disease can be said to be quite high, but it also varies with the epidemic season and climate. Usually, we set it at 20 percent. The prognosis for patients over 30 years old is more dangerous.</p>
<p>(8) Diagnosis</p>
<p>Pathological tissue examination reveals the special fact of blood vessel wall necrosis. Serum examination is the commonly performed Weil-Felix test, the Agglutination serum agglutination reaction of Prosenx × i9. Normally, i; 100 is considered positive, and there are also high values of i; 10000 and i; 20000. This reaction is almost always accurate after the sixth day, without any errors. However, its principle has not yet been satisfactorily explained. The differentiation between typhus and enteric typhoid fever is, of course, without doubt when the symptoms are clear. The spots can solve this problem. As for other systemic symptoms, patients with enteric typhoid fever exhibit a gloomy and quiet attitude, while typhus exhibits the opposite, with an unpeaceful mind. Clinicians can tell at a glance. The most precise distinction is, of course, the serum reaction. This is a non-speaking friend who will not deceive.</p>
<p>(9) Treatment and Prevention</p>
<p>The treatment of typhus and other Rickettsial diseases, because no absolutely effective drug has yet been found, serum treatment is also in the experimental stage, so everything is only symptomatic treatment, such as strengthening the heart, calming the nerves, detoxifying, promoting bowel movements, as well as ventilation of the room, and dietary care. Early use of metal preparations seems to have some beneficial effects. In general, the treatment strategy focuses on the protection of the circulatory system and the avoidance of complications.</p>
<p>The method of prevention, the application of immunological methods, cannot be discussed now. What can be done is the cleanliness of the residence and the extermination of lice. This disease is related to insects, so most of the people who suffer from this disease belong to friends who do not pay attention to hygiene in their residences or are unable to afford it, poor survivalists. Therefore, the active areas of Rickettsia in Europe are the small countries of Eastern Europe, Poland and Russia. Although there are fewer countries that pay attention to life, they have also learned a lot of lessons in the fierce battles in Europe. What about us! What should our country do? Should we first know where it is epidemic and where it exists?</p>
<h3>Investigation Report on the Health Status of Xiaoshi, Zhejiang (6)</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>(E) Conclusion</p>
<p>Although this article only pertains to the health conditions in Xiaoshi, if we expand our view to various parts of the country, we will know that some of its content can serve as a representative of Chinese health, because the health conditions in various parts of the country are mostly so bleak. From this, we further realize the immaturity of Chinese health. No wonder foreigners ridicule us as the "sick man of East Asia." So, how should we strive to catch up? Then the prosperity of the country can be expected, and the rejuvenation of the nation is hopeful! Otherwise, in the near future, I am afraid that there will be no color of our great China on the world map.</p>
<p>Now, the impressions and improvement suggestions after observation are further described below:</p>
<p>(A) Promote Health Education:</p>
<p>(1) Each school should add at least two hours of health education per week, and hire experts to give lectures to cultivate children's hygiene habits.</p>
<p>(2) Cultural institutions should form popular health lecture teams and tour around to instill health knowledge to the public at any time, with the principle of promoting public health.</p>
<p>(3) Schools should hire formal doctors as school doctors, and factories and families should also hire formal doctors with excellent experience as medical consultants.</p>
<p>(4) The medical community should also exert its natural duty at any time, do its best to instill health knowledge to the public, and strive to promote its popularization.</p>
<p>(5) The authorities should at any time order health police to force the public to attend lectures on health knowledge at designated locations by the stipulated date, and understand them within a time limit. Oral tests should be held at the end of the period. If life is still not in line with hygiene and does not pay attention to hygiene, immediate punishment will not be forgiven, in order to warn others.</p>
<p>(6) Screen health education movies, free of charge, to achieve the practical effect of popularizing health education.</p>
<p>(7) The social education section originally established by the education authority should be changed to the health education section, and experts should be hired to promote it, with the principle of achieving the popularization of health education and the development of health education in various schools.</p>
<p>(B) Improve Municipal Administration and People's Health</p>
<p>(1) Strange clothing, bare legs and arms, exposed chests, and applying rouge and powder are not only harmful to hygiene, but also harmful to public morals, so they should be banned.</p>
<p>(2) The health matters of restaurants and other places should be closely monitored by the authorities, and special regulations should be formulated for management.</p>
<p>(3) The authorities should order the old-fashioned old houses to open more windows to ensure that lighting, ventilation, and warmth can meet the minimum requirements of hygiene principles.</p>
<p>(4) Streets that have been in disrepair for many years are not only rugged and uneven, which is inconvenient for pedestrians, but even inevitably dangerous. Therefore, methods should be found to correct them.</p>
<p>More trash cans should be set up in streets and alleys, and the authorities should add more cleaners to implement cleaning work, and should engage in health publicity to make the public pay attention to public morality in order to promote and transform environmental sanitation.</p>
<p>(5) Establish public bathhouses for the common people, and everything must be for the common people and meet hygiene standards, and provide low-priced supplies to the public to cultivate good habits of bathing and protect the health of the people.</p>
<p>(6) Form a disease insurance savings association and promote a savings system in order to prepare for a rainy day, because disease is impermanent, and medical expenses are unavoidable. The moneyed class is certainly not worried, but most of the people are proletarians and their monthly income is very small and their income is limited. It is difficult to cope with illness, and even temporarily die because of insufficient financial resources. This is lamentable. Therefore, savings should be made in peacetime for use in times of illness.</p>
<p>(7) Establish more public medical institutions (such as district hospitals) to seek health protection for the common people and to seek welfare for the society. All medical expenses should be completely exempted in order to seek the universality of scientific medicine. This organization will also be responsible for free vaccination and preventive injections. The expenses will be generously donated by philanthropists.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>The Key to Breaking Through the Difficulties Lies in Japan</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Since Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe came to China and had his first negotiation with Foreign Minister Zhang, even if the conditions have been slightly flexible, the opinions have never been close. Therefore, the news reports on the Sino-Japanese negotiations have recently revealed that sometimes the atmosphere is tense, and sometimes the situation is relaxed. In fact, since the Kawagoe-Zhang negotiations, there has never been any relaxation, and there has never been any optimism. The so-called relaxation is just some diplomatic air, not the truth.</p>
<p>May I ask, has the other party's established policy changed? Has the policy of aggression been abandoned? At most, it is just a matter of degree, so where does the relaxation come from? Where does the peace come from? The Japanese policy of aggression against China was originally one, but it was carried out either through diplomatic channels or not. Therefore, if the Japanese established policy remains unchanged, whether it is through diplomatic channels or not, this road will always be blocked.</p>
<p>Therefore, now, if we want to see how tense or relaxed the situation in the Sino-Japanese negotiations is, we should first look at the other party's actions in North China. There is no need to talk about anything else. Even arbitrarily building airfields, arbitrarily increasing troops stationed, arbitrarily conducting large-scale exercises, arbitrarily protecting smuggling, and arbitrarily investing in the development of North China, are these all relaxed attitudes? One side is in the process of mediation, while the other side has not slightly withdrawn its traces of aggression. May I ask, where does the relaxation come from?</p>
<p>Moreover, looking at the recent Japanese newspaper editorials, their attitudes are very inconsistent. Most of them advocate proceeding through diplomatic channels, while another group of newspapers has quite radical editorials. Although the attitudes of both sides are different in terms of soft and hard, and rigidity and flexibility, one wants to achieve its goal by using gentle methods, and the other wants to achieve its goal by using radical methods. Although the methods used by both sides are different, they actually have the same goal by different routes.</p>
<p>If those who advocate solving the problem through diplomatic channels can abandon their original consistent advocacy and truly implement the principle of goodwill, it would certainly be welcome to us. If, however, they proceed through diplomatic channels but still adhere to their consistent policy, then it is better to be radical and lose national sovereignty and territory than to be gentle and lose national sovereignty and territory. The iron case is as solid as a mountain and cannot be shaken. For this diplomatic negotiation, no matter how difficult it is and no matter how many twists and turns there are, there is absolutely no room for compromise outside of not losing an iota of sovereignty over the territory of North China. This is indeed the consensus of all the people of our country, and it is also what the government authorities have sworn to and can be questioned by heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether the difficulties of this negotiation can be broken through depends entirely on Japan, not on our country. Our country's minimum demands have absolutely no flexibility or borrowing; only by studying the soft and hard tones of foreign newspapers, there are also two types of natures. One is to simply make these two tones, the so-called intimidation and inducement, combining both soft and hard, so that our country is easy to comply. This is indeed a kind of diplomatic tactic. One is that Japanese diplomacy towards China was originally divided into two factions, one advocating relaxation and one advocating radicalism. The opinions of the two factions were originally incompatible. The contradiction within itself is prone to internal disputes. This is the so-called Hirota himself standing at a crossroads. We now do not ask whether it is a tactic or a divergence. We must set our minds, insist on territorial sovereignty, and not give up even an iota. Our country can ignore whether the tactics are hard or soft.</p>
<h3>Punishment</h3>
<p>— Lyon</p>
<p>When I was a child, I loved to listen to Broad-Mouth Zhang San tell stories about "beheadings." I was often both happy and scared. I was happy because he gesticulated and told the stories vividly. I was scared because he told them so realistically that it seemed like there was a killing field in front of me. The "wooden stump" rolling under the eaves seemed like a head that had just been cut off, and it even seemed to be flashing its eyes. The more I listened, the more scared I became, but the more scared I was, the more I wanted to listen. This is exactly like the saying "Knowing there are tigers in the mountains, I prefer to go to the tiger mountains." Perhaps children's psychology is naturally like this. The most touching part of what Broad-Mouth Zhang San said was, "No sooner said than done, the knife rose and a head fell, blood spurted out, everyone clapped their hands, and some people dipped steamed buns in the hot blood to eat..."</p>
<p>Such scary situations would often fall into my dreams, and I would jump straight out of bed in a panic. My mother found out the reason and forbade me to go to the ancestral hall and hang out with Broad-Mouth Zhang San. Later, I don't know how, Broad-Mouth Zhang San stole the incense burner and candle holder from the ancestral hall. The clan chief ordered someone to break his right leg and drive him out of the village. That day, I happened to be sending cotton strips to my aunt's house. I don't know how such an interesting person endured that physical punishment.</p>
<p>Until now, I have never seen a public execution. One reason is the lack of opportunity, and the other is that my mood is not as good as it was in childhood. I often can't bear to watch the killing of chickens or the gutting of fish. The bright, shiny blade, the tearing of the thin skin and flesh, and the splashing of blood can all give me a strong feeling of cruelty. Although I don't have that shallow "compassion," I did refuse a friend's invitation to visit a "cattle slaughtering company." I am really afraid of the execution ground for the cattle. Because I was accidentally pricked by a steel needle and my finger hurt all night, it made me think of blades, ropes, lead bullets, "skinning machines," electric chairs... all kinds of scientific and historical instruments of torture for dealing with people or things, and the cruelty and pain of physical punishment that is better than "needle pricking fingers."</p>
<p>But the more I want to avoid something, the more I can't avoid it. The mutton shop at the entrance of the alley is opening again in due season. Usually, whenever I see a pig's head hanging on the iron hook in the butcher shop, with the severed neck oozing blood, I seem to feel a slight pain in my own neck. This must be a nervous reaction. What's more, the mutton shop is killing sheep in public at the door, scalding them with boiling water, plucking their wool, breaking their bellies, splitting their heads, and putting them in steaming barrels. In general, this kind of situation is considered extremely ordinary. Some "eaters" will even show a leisurely attitude, assessing that the "water content" of the sheep that is being pressed on the long bench by the butcher and waiting to be slaughtered is not bad, and some people are waiting halfway to buy sheep's blood or sheep's wool. I really admire them. After all, their hearts are several times stronger than mine. They have no qualms about the death sentence being suffered by living things. In their minds, except for "eating pleasure" and "profit," there is no premonition of anything else. Or the biggest reason is that the one who is dying is not of the same kind?</p>
<p>However, isn't the world full of crowds of people like sheep who are being slaughtered by their own kind? But they also show a leisurely attitude, harboring "profit" calculations, holding a "eating pleasure" principle, and waiting for opportunities halfway. This not only makes me admire, but it simply makes me amazed.</p>
<p>Because I have to pass through the alley every day, I have many opportunities to see the scene of killing sheep at the entrance of the mutton shop. It is almost the same as listening to Broad-Mouth Zhang San tell "beheading" stories. The more scared I am, the more unbearable it is, but the more I want to take a look. This temporary psychological abnormality often takes precedence. Several times I stood in the crowd of idlers watching the killing of sheep. At first, the sheep were very docile and were thrown on the long bench. The butcher grabbed the skin and flesh between its head and neck, and the sharp knife pierced through it. With a cry of "Ma," fresh blood gushed out from the severed throat and poured into the bucket. When I looked at the remaining two sheep tied to the pillars, they were already wandering around, but they had lost their freedom to survive.</p>
<p>When the second one was started, it actually started a kind of stubborn and struggling action. However, torture was finally added to it by the butcher's smirk. At this time, I thought: If I were that third sheep, seeing two companions being killed one after another, how sad and indignant would I be, and how would I free myself from the imminent torture. However, sheep are finally sheep, and the "fat" and "docility" of sheep have only created "eating pleasure" and "profit" for ordinary people. Just like me, who is thin and often fights with fate, I have to endure the whip of a cow for a living. This is a kind of vicious "private punishment." However, am I so docile?</p>
<h3>At the Tomb</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>The warm morning sun makes one feel a bit lazy. Dewdrops shimmer between the blades of grass. Something rustles gently and softly. The grass, the green expanse, breathes shallowly, emitting a rich fragrance. Several sparrows hop on the bamboo fence, while diligent farmers are already tilling the fields, the hoes flashing in the sunlight.</p>
<p>I followed that cinder path, turned several bends, and entered the cemetery—finding the place from yesterday.</p>
<p>Everything was still the same as yesterday: two baskets of flowers placed on the tombstone, dewdrops clinging to the flowers.</p>
<p>I sat down.</p>
<p>It is said that a wanderer is good at dreaming, reminiscing—and feeling melancholic.</p>
<p>I sat there. Something slipped into my mind, making me restless. For a time, many thoughts about the past, the future—uncontrollable tides of thought—surged up. ...</p>
<p>I thought of the stubborn old man, thought of my own wandering life.</p>
<p>I sighed deeply. I never dreamed that one day I would be able to personally watch the person I admired most enter the earth, nor did I expect that, although I had no chance to meet him while he was alive, this stubborn person now lived so close to my residence—or could even be said to be my neighbor.</p>
<p>In this complex and contradictory mood, I deeply tasted the irreplaceable sorrow, but at the same time, I began to console myself with an Ah Q-like selfishness.</p>
<p>For many years, often when I was in trouble in Java, searching for work from one town to another, when I begged for travel expenses to cross the Java Sea to the lush, malaria-infested Borneo and suffered my brother-in-law's cold shoulder, when I stayed in a hotel on Changdi Er Malu in Guangzhou for more than a month and was finally driven out, or even—when my family finally took pity and sent money to support me to embark on the proud student life I am now living, I had a burning desire to pour out my feelings. However, to whom should I pour them out? In the vast sea of people, I could hardly find anyone!—I never dreamed that this stubborn old man, whom I had admired since my childhood in the first year of junior high school, would one day lie in a place I could reach. Now, I have finally found a place to pour out my feelings. Regardless of whether this stubborn old man is lying silently in the grave, regardless of</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>whether this stubborn old man can hear me or not, I have finally found a place to pour out my feelings. From now on, I plan to come here whenever I have a chance, to keep the old man company and pour out the words I have wanted to say for years. This old man, who was so stubborn in life that he struggled with the disease for ten years even after microbes had eroded his lungs, I believe he is just as stubborn after death—perhaps, he can hear my outpouring, and that would be my satisfaction!</p>
<p>The cemetery worker walked by, casting a strange glance at me.</p>
<p>"There's still work to be done; this tomb isn't finished yet!" he said.</p>
<p>I nodded to him, thanking him for his concern.</p>
<p>The stone mason by the roadside outside the cemetery's bamboo fence began to work with a clanging sound.</p>
<h3>Chronicles of Jin River Bay</h3>
<p>— Yegao</p>
<p>Jin River Chronicle 4</p>
<p>The boat had arrived at Jin River Bay, not far from our destination. Here, we would have a half-day stopover, because everything we had stored for eating and using was almost gone.</p>
<p>In front of the bay was a small market, formed by several interconnected large villages, with two short and quiet streets running back and forth. More than a hundred earthen-tile houses were lazily crowded on both sides, low, dilapidated, and filled with a desolate feeling. Half a year ago, this was a bustling place with a population of 30,000. Rice mills, large businesses, money houses, the export of inland local products, and the import of foreign goods all passed through here. But since the last time they "ge" something, the situation has changed. The wealthy families have rolled up the essence of the entire market and fled. Now, what remains is just the dregs and husks of this market!</p>
<p>After the boat docked, the boatman carried a large bag ashore to buy rice and vegetables. We stayed in the cabin to watch over things. Sometimes, feeling stuffy, we would climb out of the cabin and stand on the deck, glancing at the shore. Perhaps it was because our attire was a bit different from the locals, but we immediately attracted the attention of the people coming and going on the shore. The slope of the pier was crowded with about twenty or thirty idle people, all so thin and ragged. In such cold days, there were even people living half-naked.</p>
<p>We stood for a while, afraid that gathering too many people on the shore would cause trouble, so we waved our hands to them and wanted to climb back into the cabin. Unexpectedly, this made them burst into loud laughter, and the sound still echoed brightly in the air even after we had settled in the cabin.</p>
<p>After about a quarter of an hour, the sound had subsided. We tentatively climbed out of the cabin again. The curious people had dispersed, and the pier was quiet. However, not far from us, there were already two people, sneaking onto a small barge docked by the shore, climbing towards our boat.</p>
<p>One of these two people was an old man of about fifty years old, short and thin, with a sallow face. He was wearing a half-naked garment full of patches. Closely following behind him was a girl of fourteen or fifteen years old, with her hair cut short and scattered loosely on her head, her face thin, dark, and petite. She was wearing a large garment that did not match her figure at all. Her two bare feet nimbly searched every plank, jumping from here to there.</p>
<p>This aroused our curiosity, so we watched them carefully. However, they stood motionless on a broken stern plank adjacent to our boat. The old man's face showed a worried and hesitant look. The little girl hid half behind him, shyly biting her hem, her face lowered, looking at her pair of withered little bare feet. The old man looked at us for a while, then suddenly said softly to the little girl:</p>
<p>"Go ahead, don't be shy, they are good guests. ..."</p>
<p>After saying that, he shook the little girl's shoulders, turned around, and walked back towards the shore. The little girl looked at us timidly with doubtful eyes, then suddenly jumped nimbly onto our boat, her thin lips trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" We called out to her with some confusion, with a stern look on our faces. She probably didn't expect us to be like this, and hurriedly took two steps back in surprise, clutching her head tightly with both hands, as if afraid we would hit her. She turned her head back to look at the shore. On the shore, the old man was standing anxiously, waving his hand at her angrily:</p>
<p>"Little devil! What are you afraid of? They are good guests. ..."</p>
<p>She looked helpless, then turned back to us again. Suddenly, in her deep eye sockets, several crystal tears welled up, and she sobbed softly in a breathless voice.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" we asked her again, but our tone was already gentle.</p>
<p>"... Sirs, save the poor... give me some money, I'll sleep with you... " she wiped away her tears with her hand, her voice trembling, her face covered with a deep blush. "We are starving. There is no way. ..." After saying that, she cried again, sobbing.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, and we understood everything. What made this immature girl do such a lowly thing? It was hunger. Although we knew that this hunger threatened more than just her here, that tens of thousands of people were living like her, a strong sense of sympathy made us unable to help but give her some help. We searched our bodies for the few foreign coins we had and gave them to her. She held them in her hands as if she had obtained a treasure, and turned back to the shore. The old man's face was shining with light, and he hurriedly shouted loudly again:</p>
<p>"Kowtow to the sirs!"</p>
<p>But we stopped her and waved our hands to tell her to go. She hesitated, then turned and walked away.</p>
<h3>A Daughter of Penang</h3>
<p>— Harris</p>
<p>Taking a ship all night from the remote port where I grew up, I arrived at the docks of Penang in the clear morning as the sky barely dawned and the light radiated everywhere. Before coming, I had already sent a letter to my aunt who lives here, so this morning, my cousin specially took half a day off from the foreign firm he works for and waited for me at the dock with a smile. I had not seen my cousin for two years, and he had matured a lot—As we rode in the car towards my aunt's house, I also asked about my cousin, Irene.</p>
<p>"Ah, Irene?" A look of joy appeared on my cousin's face, "She is already a beautiful girl."</p>
<p>Sure enough, in the living room of my aunt's house, I met Irene—a slender figure, wearing a thin white gauze western dress, but with a pair of embroidered slippers on her feet, obviously she was at home and not going out. The shallow dimples still remained at the corners of her mouth, but her skin was darker than before. Besides, even her hair was no different from when we met two years ago. In this first meeting, my aunt was too talkative, asking about the situation at home and my mother's health, until it was almost time to eat, and Irene did not interrupt a single word, sitting on the side, holding a novel and reading. It wasn't until after dinner, when my aunt went back to her room to rest, that I had a chance to talk to Irene.</p>
<p>"Irene, you've grown so much!" I began like this.</p>
<p>"Really!" she replied, lowering her head, as if she wasn't as innocent and mischievous as usual.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen each other for two years, so we're a bit estranged... Irene, I'm so happy to have my father's permission to come to Penang to study! I thought that we could live together in the future, and see each other every day, and I was so happy..."</p>
<p>I said, staring straight at her. At this time, she raised her head as if she had been touched by something, her eyes met mine, and then she said to me:</p>
<p>"You are so lucky. But I can't continue studying."</p>
<p>"What? Did you say you're not going to study?" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't love to continue studying, but it's my father and mother's idea. They think that once a daughter reaches seventeen or eighteen, she shouldn't show her face outside anymore! She has to hide at home, waiting to get married..."</p>
<p>"Is there such a thing? What era is this!" I exclaimed indignantly.</p>
<p>But my indignation did not get my aunt's understanding. When I protested to her on behalf of my cousin Irene, she replied with a smile: "You are really an ignorant child!" Outside, I met several educators from Penang, and they told me that Penang is the place where China's inherent feudal ideas are the strongest; no one sympathizes with the oppression that daughters suffer. They also said that women's education is more popular anywhere in the Malay Peninsula, but only in Penang is it murky.</p>
<p>Irene seemed to just listen to the dictates of fate regarding her future and did not participate in her own opinions at all—this is such a mistake! The summer vacation was about to pass, and the schools were busy with the approaching start of the school term, and I also registered at a middle school. Irene, on the other hand, was still hiding at home reading novels, spending her bleak days. I really couldn't stand it anymore. One day, I grabbed her and said:</p>
<p>"Irene, listen to me for a few words. What's the difference between a girl and a boy? She should enjoy the right to live like a boy, and receive the same education! If you listen to the words of your stubborn old father, then you are just a slave. Where is your freedom, and where is your happiness? Irene, go to school. If Penang can't allow you to do this, can't you return to the motherland? Your brother will give you financial help, I talked to him about it this morning."</p>
<p>After hearing me say this in one breath, Irene threw the book aside as if she was very moved, and asked:</p>
<p>"Really? Can brother really do it?"</p>
<p>"You can ask him yourself."</p>
<p>My cousin promised everything, and this Irene, who was originally as docile as a lamb, suddenly stirred up a rebellious mood. One morning when it was drizzling, just as the sky was dawning, Irene carried simple luggage, escorted by me and my cousin, to the pier, leaving a letter to her parents at home. On the way to the pier, Irene shouted with rare excitement:</p>
<p>"Old Penang, goodbye! Really goodbye!"</p>
<p>It was drizzling, drizzling! When we got to the pier, it was raining even harder, as if it wanted to wash Penang completely, making people feel extra happy.</p>
<p>As the ship's whistle blew, Irene stood on the deck and waved to us. She must still be shouting in her heart:</p>
<p>"Really goodbye, old Penang!"</p>

<p>Ah Q</p>
<p>Lu Xun is dead! We have nothing to commemorate him with, so all members of our society will from today onwards broadcast Ah Q to comfort his departed soul.</p>
<p>Although the script is not from his pen, in any case, Mr. Chen Mengshao adapted it based on the True Story.</p>
<p>Ah Q is a representative figure of the proletariat and the ignorant class. Those who know Ah Q say he is a loyal worker, those who do not know Ah Q say he is a thieving rogue. Those who know Ah Q say he is a solitary person with "humanity," those who do not know Ah Q say he is an obscene thing. Those who know Ah Q say he is a plaintiff of human grievance, those who do not know Ah Q say he is a damnable traitor.</p>
<p>Ah Q's character brought to people is the extreme portrayal of the inferior nature of the Chinese people. Mr. Lu Xun's creation of the True Story of Ah Q shocked the literary world, naturally our current era will absolutely not allow the existence of Ah Q, but we hope that the Ah Q attitude of the Chinese people will end here, because the current situation requires us to wash away the shame of Ah Q!</p>

Hearing this was like a thunderbolt. He cried so hard his heart was breaking. He held a funeral and helped the poor, doing good deeds to pray for the deceased. But who knew that the mother and daughter-in-law were still alive, suffering family disasters and hiding in the deep mountains. They lived with a shepherd among the sheep, longing for their family but not daring to return. They endured hardship and begged for food, filled with tears and grief. Husband and wife met at the tomb, and they were surprised by each other's appearance. After questioning each other, the truth came out. Only then did they know that the aunt's conscience was lost, and his dear mother had cried her eyes dry. They changed into official robes on the spot, their suffering came to an end, and they smiled. The evil woman was anxious at this time, kneeling in the middle and vowing to clear suspicion.

<p>The Grand View Garden's scenery is very secluded, like a miniature Penglai Island. The thatched cottage in front is open and elegant, clearly indicating the beautiful scenery hidden in the Red Mansion. Hidden within is an unparalleled beauty, said to be more beautiful than flowers. Outside the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, the shadows of bamboo grow. The bitterness and sorrow are all like autumn. Her parents are far away, and she leans on the carved railing, filled with endless hatred. Roaming the garden, the scenery is secluded. Only the maids come and go. She is lazy to comb and wash her hair as usual, only fearing the dusk when the stars and moon are like hooks, hooking up the endless sorrow in her heart. Sadly, her loving mother passed away first, leaving the lonely girl to stay at her relatives' home. The old lady loves and cherishes her like a treasure, and the sisters' friendship is deep. Separated from her father by thousands of miles, her soul often circles over Yangzhou in dreams. Hoping for an imperial decree, she dances in colored clothes to express her filial piety. When will my lifelong wish be fulfilled? I burn incense and pray day and night. The most bitter is the matter of concern, and the two words "life-long" are not free. Although there will be a beautiful couple in the future, the old man of the moon has not yet planned. This feeling is shameful to say to outsiders, and she cries tears in the wind towards the moon. Her own infatuation, her own plan.</p>

<p>Snowflakes dance and fill the sky. Xu Niang's heart is in a mess. Alone facing the cold window, she often sighs. She remembers being spoiled and raised in a farming family as a child. Her parents loved and cherished her like a treasure, and only the bright moon in the sky had not yet been taken. Three meals a day, she could choose what to eat. In winter, she wore brocade robes, and in summer, she wore silk gauze. Her parents arranged the marriage, truly hoping that the couple would live in harmony. Unexpectedly, her husband was a pleasure-seeking person. He did not do his job properly, indulging in flowers. Moreover, the elders in the family were addicted to opium, and the family business declined. Now, as the cold wind blows and the sky gets colder, she lacks clothes and food. The poor children cry sadly, wearing thin clothes with little cotton. Her heart is sad, and tears are shed. She hates that her husband's heart is too crooked, wasting money and seeking pleasure. Does he know that there is no rice or firewood at home? He laughs happily with those geishas, enjoying the lanterns and flowers, but she sacrifices her delicate body to work diligently. Sadly, there is not much money to help the family. Moreover, the children still need to study. She is a miserable and suffering woman in a skirt. Moreover, she has borrowed from relatives and neighbors, and she has no choice but to go back to her mother's house. Regardless of the cold weather, the frozen ground, and the uneven road.</p>

<h3>"Tiger Gets Married"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The Youth Association's Ninth Floor Is Another Grand Occasion</p>
<p>It's really fortunate. I had just returned from another location when I received a call from a friend saying, "The great Tiger," Zheng Junli, and Miss Huang Chen were getting married at the Youth Association building in Ba Xian Qiao.</p>
<p>Although I didn't receive a "We are getting married today..." notification, I had met "Tiger Face" a few times, so I put down all the work I was about to start and hired a car to go to the Youth Association. As the elevator took me up to the ninth floor, I suddenly thought of Tang Na and Lan Ping; Zhao Dan and Ye Lusi; Gu Eryi and Du Xiaojuan. When these pairs of actors got married, Zheng Junli and Li Qing were the matchmakers. (Li Qing has now joined Lianhua and has already started working on a segment of "Lianhua Symphony"). Many friends asked him that day when he would get married, but he just smiled and didn't answer because the "Standard Maid" was also present that day, accompanied by a "Southern Youth with Southern Hair." This situation was indeed too exciting for our Tiger.</p>
<p>But during the performance of "The Government Inspector," backstage at the Jincheng Grand Theater, introduced by Gu Menghu, he met Miss Huang Chen. From acquaintance to love, from love to marriage. Seeing Junli shaking hands with every guest with a radiant face, his friends seemed to feel a kind of "contagious" joy, a joy like drinking wine. Zhao Dan, Tang Na, Shi Chao, and even "Chamber of Commerce President" Yin Xiucen, were pushed by the wine to happily urge the bride and groom to report on their love story after Mr. Shen Junru's speech. The result was copying an old article, "And so on," thank you all!</p>
<p>To congratulate "lovers finally becoming family," someone initiated a signing, each person contributing one yuan to send the bride and groom dancing. So, thirty or forty people marched grandly to Lido. I left early because it was too late. Probably the joy of that evening cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to congratulating the newlyweds for their efforts in society, I also hope to hear the good news of another matchmaker when three pairs of actors get married in the near future. (The above is the newlyweds' signing ceremony)</p>
<h3>Minxin News Bulletin</h3>
<p>Li Keng studies daily at the nearby Peizhen Elementary School, waiting for the filming of "Gate of Flesh and Spirit" to begin. The filming work will also be carried out without hindering his studies, so as not to neglect his schoolwork.</p>
<p>"Gate of Flesh and Spirit," co-directed by Zhong Shigen and Zhao Ce, is expected to be released within the solar year and will create a new style for Chinese films.</p>
<p>"New Avenue," directed by Bu Wancang, started auspiciously on the 17th of this month. Originally, it was planned to go to Xuzhou and the surrounding areas to shoot exterior scenes first. Due to time constraints, it was decided to shoot several interior scenes first before departing.</p>
<p>The photography work of "New Humanism" is the responsibility of Zhuang Guojun and Shi Shiqing. Zhu Shutao also serves as the photography assistant and photographer for both "New Humanism" and "Gate of Flesh and Spirit."</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. on the 17th, the first day of "New Humanism," filming began on the interior scene of a Beijing restaurant. A total of thirty to forty staff and actors worked until 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Li Junqing, Huang Yunzhen, Qiu Yuanyuan, and Zhu Yaoting all play roles in "New Humanism."</p>
<p>The business department has been extremely busy recently with the distribution matters for the public performances of "Maternal Love" in various locations. "Maternal Love" is also awaiting public performance in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Qin Wei, an artist who studied in Japan, has recently been hired by Minxin Company after returning to China to work on art and design, and also to work on the scenery for "New Humanism."</p>
<p>There is a modern female teacher role in "Gate of Flesh and Spirit." In order to discover talent, Minxin plans to find and hire a newcomer to play the role, and it is currently in progress.</p>
