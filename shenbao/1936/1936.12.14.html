<p>（南京）中央當局爲欲明瞭西安現狀起見、曾於十三日派飛機、飛往西安上空及附近一帶偵察、據報西安城內情形異常混沌、且頗有巷戰模樣、東北軍似由渭南向臨潼方面集中、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）十三日下午三時中央舉行會議、在京各委員均出席、由居正主席、何應欽張羣相繼報吿、至六時始散、聞會議時曾有某委等主張由中央派員赴西安一行、但無决定、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）西安事變前、蔣委員長於十一下午離西安赴華淸池留宿、十二日上午蔣氏卽於此時被迫轉赴西安暫居、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）與蔣委員長及張學良二人、均極接近之西人端納氏、現擬設法飛往西安、一覘該處之眞象、如屬可能、更擬使蔣氏恢復自由、聞端氏接西安事變消息時、適在漢口、業於今日飛往洛陽、蔣夫人宋美齡女士、本擬乘飛機前往洛陽、臨時作罷、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣委員長顧問端納、十三日晨隨孔副院長由滬抵京、卽偕黃仁霖飛洛轉陝探視蔣委員長、端納曾先致電張學良、行前已接到張之復電、（十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）何應欽晨電張學良、勸其覺悟、聞張已覆電何、（十三日專電）張學良叛變後、在京之辦事處招牌十三晨已經取去、辦事人員聞已潛逃無踪、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）洛陽方面駐有張部砲兵二團、有旅長黃某統率、傳事變起時、張曾電黃刦奪銀行、看守軍械所、及飛機塲、黃不遵命、將原竄持往報吿祝維周、並由祝率隊前往將二團武裝完全解除、現洛地尚安全、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）今日有入見馮玉祥及李烈鈞、詢以一切、馮李均言在此時間、應處以鍞靜、其餘不欲有所表示、現京市戒備加緊、治安無虞、津浦路十三日客車仍照通、貨車停開、（十三日專電）</p>

<p>（南京）據聞西安今早、懸紅旗、惟政府飛機駛過該城時、當卽倉猝移去、據南京所接可靠消息、謂西安事種、開始於星期六晨八時三十分、當時西安各處、皆可聞得來復槍聲、蔣委員長曾於事變之前晚、下令準備專車、升火待發、蓋準備决晨向張部軍官演說後、卽離西安也、後因蔣氏屈開車時刻、仍未到站、車站人員頗呈恐惶、比聞槍聲四起、兼以路軌掘斷、遂愈形憂慮矣、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（北平）今日此間人士、對於西安事變悄息、皆極表震動、惟二日前平地所接西安來電、已暗示該地情形、不甚安穩、此舉之起因、係由於蔣委員長及張學良二人、對於勦共軍事上頗不一致、蔣氏主張堅决勦共、據傳蔣曾語人、謂有人在共匪未肅淸以前、而高談興日作戰者、皆爲國家之叛徒云、至於張學良所部軍隊、此間數月以前、已接有消息、謂彼等與共匪頗有好感、不與共匪作戰、至少已有九個月之久、聞張氏部隊大部集中於潼關一帶、冀察當局發言人、今日語記者云、此次西安事變、如證明果係張學良與共匪聯合所造成、則冀察兩省當局、自當仍秉其平日反共政策、反抗此次變亂云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（太原）張學良叛變後、晋陝電訊、迄十三日午後三時尚未通、雖能收到無綫電訊、惟零碎不成段落、但一般判斷、蔣委員長之安全、絕無問題、（十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>外交部通知　中外各使領</p>
<p>（南京）張學良在西安叛變、中央已明令　先遞其本兼各職交軍事委員會嚴辦、外部亦於十三日將事變經過、分別通知我駐外各使領館、及各國駐我國使節、（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>傳于學忠有　在陜被扣訊</p>
<p>（南京）現在陝之中央重要人員、計有邵力子·邵元冲·蔣作賓·蔣鼎文·蔣伯誠·毛邦初·毛炳文·陳誠·陳繼承·陳調元·錢大鈞·朱紹良等、傳均被扣留、學于學忠亦有因反對張之主張、在陝被扣之說、于之駐京代表五日前始由甘肅返京赴滬、十三日晨由滬趕回、據云、彼離甘時、于尚在西安、被扣與否已去電査詢、迄下午止、尚未接覆電、于所部共計三師、大半均係魯人、不致有其他變動云、（十三日專電）</p>

<p>張學良通電　列名人乖謬</p>
<p>（南京）中央某要員因外間對張學良通電列名人傳說不一、特就原電列名諸人、加以分析、發表談話云、張學良十二日通電不獨內容背謬、極顚倒誣蔑之能事、卽其通電列名、允顯見脅泊背捏之一斑、査其電末列名、除張學良外、共十八人、如楊席城最近尚與中央要人時通消息、且據報馮欽哉·孫蔚如·均在西安被監視、已可見其一斑、至於陳調元·陳誠·朱紹良·蔣鼎文·衛立煌·萬耀煌·陳繼承·馬占山八人、均係軍政重要長官、奉召赴陝者、乃亦被列在內、甚至錢大鈞係委員長侍從室主任、邵力子爲陝西省主席、亦被列入、此皆任何入所不能置信者、故就該電全體列名人加以研究、則其餘之何柱國·王以哲·經澂流·董英斌、于學忠五人、是否出諸本人意志、亦大有問題、總之、西安變局其性質之乖謬、於此可見云、（十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>西北勦匪部　事先索經費</p>
<p>（南京）據悉財政情形者消息、西北勦匪總部經費、向例係每月十日及二十五日分兩次撥付、本月份該部藉口年關、迭請將全月經費、於十日作一次發付、當局幷未允准、現證以西安事變、適於十二日發生、足見其蓄謀似有預定、（十三日中央社電）暫留西安之軍事領袖</p>

<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這一次西安的非常事變。是我國牛死關頭的問題。應付一不得當。就可以使國家重陷於分崩離析的局面。給敵人以加緊侵略的絕好機會。因此時至今日。中央及地方軍政當局固然應該用審愼而堅决的手段。來收拾這空前困難的大局。全國民衆也應該爲國家爲民族。把意志統一起來。給政府作堅强有力的後盾。</p>
<p>在當前的局勢中間。最可慮的一點。是綏東戰事正在進展。而後方竟發生了這樣不幸的變亂。這會影響到前綫將士的作戰精神。因而使國防重心的綏遠。更加不易防守。關於這一點。我們希望綏遠前錢的國軍。繼續爲捍衛國土。盡最大的努力。不要因這决事變。而動搖抗敵的意志。</p>
<p>其决可慮的。是在西安被叛軍扣留的蔣委員長及中央軍重要將領陳誠蔣鼎文等多人的安全和自由問題。蔣委員長是我國最高的軍事領袖。他的威望一向是全國軍政的唯一重心。現在他和部下最忠實的幾個重要將領。都失却了自由。這就有使統一的中國。重復趨於渙散的危險。前晚中央聯席會議决議加添軍委會常務委員的人數。這些新發表的常務委員。都是北伐期間最有功蹟的將領。他們的聲望。儘足以頒導西安一隅以外。全國各省的部隊。在這最嚴重的非常期間。全國的治安是一定維持得住的。昨日晉魯粵湘各省軍政領袖對於西安事變的表示。就可以證明這一點。然而要使全國軍心獲得眞正的統一。終究非先使蔣委員長及其被扣屬僚恢復自由不可。我們希望雖在非常困難的情形之下。中央還能保留對張學良方面的接洽途徑。把蔣委員長等營救出來。</p>
<p>其决。張學良違反國紀背叛中央。應該怎樣懲戒。也是値得焦慮的。這樣的叛逆。在中央方面。當然非加以討伐不可。然而戰事一起。蔣委員長等的安全就會發生問題。在這樣的矛盾情勢之下。中央方面毅然决然頒布了張學良褫職查辦令。這對內可以振紀綱。對外也可以表示中央的力量。的確是必要而且適當的處置。叛軍人數不過十餘萬。在遠過此數的中央軍壓迫之下。遲早總是可以解决的。然而爲避免仇者快而親者痛的流血計。我們卻還希望張學良或其部下有最後的覺悟。自動地無條件地使蔣委員長等早日恢復自由。</p>
<p>以上三點。是我們目下所當認識淸楚的。蔣委員長雖然暫時離開了領導的地位。然而中山先生所昭示的三民主義却還領導着我們。這一種最滴應於革命現階段的政治主張。可以把全國愛國家愛民族的人心。維繫起來。結成堅强無比的一體。我們必須向全世界宣吿道。中國還是整個的統一的中國。還是不可輕侮的中國。</p>

<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>再看輸入日本的重要商品種類吧，也舉出八種最重要的：</p>
<p>小麥，豆類，原油及重油，棉花，羊毛，鐵，機械類，木材。</p>
<p>輸入的，差不多十分之八九都是原料，及一小部份半製品。有小麥的輸入，但有小麥粉的輸出。有大批的棉花及羊毛輸入，卽有大批的綿布及毛織物輸出。惟有鐵和原油及重油，是用以發展日本軍需工業的。</p>
<p>但是，無論如何輸入也是感覺不够的。軍備競爭是不到資本主義滅亡時不會罷手的，各國都一樣，但原料不足，就使這般野心家發愁了。</p>
<p>美國是礦產的主要國，由於不足，由於競爭，礦產價格在美國也越來越提高了。這在非常需要礦產輸入的日本，不免就很呌苦。今再從價格的騰貴上來看看：</p>
<p>不用說，鐵是一切產業存在的基本。一九三五年，日本鐵的產量達三百五十萬噸，這可以說勉强够日本國內的需要了。但還須輸入鐵的原料，因日本的礦石生產額就很少，雖有礦山，但採出額也很貧乏。沒有礦石的輸入，就不能製成鐵了。所以一九三五年的輸入額達三百三十萬噸。便是用爲鋼材原料的銑鐵，屑鐵，也不得不大量的輸入。一九三五年，銑鐵輸入百萬噸屑鐵百七十萬噸。比起一九三四年來，銑鐵的輸入增加百分之六十，屑鐵增加百分之二十。輸入是增加了，但鐵價也騰貴了，在莫索里尼侵吞阿比西尼亞時，一噸　物用的鐵價爲四十七元五角，製鋼用的爲四十六元五角。但至最近（十月—）上記兩種鐵價，都漲到四十九元了。每噸漲二元餘，以三百萬噸的需要說，便多費六百餘萬元。這也可以說是目前日本大衆負擔加重（增稅）的基本原因之一。</p>
<p>屑鐵大半是由美國輸入的，但因美國的需要量也在增加，且因這是軍需工業原料品，「輸出禁化案」，料不定到某種形勢下也會通過的—這更逼着漲價了。從現在看來，在日本內地，一噸上等鐵已值六十元，比起去年秋天來，差不多漲了二十元。</p>
<p>可知「製鐵國策」，「貿易統制」，都是不能不呌的了。華北龍烟鐵礦的氣運，也就在今日的鐵荒狀態下，首先復活了。</p>
<p>其决，電氣銅也是很重要的。在歐洲大戰前，日本的電氣銅，不但够用，且有輸出。但因競爭不過美國，且需要急速擴大，今已變成電氣銅的輸入國了。在上表中，我們看見，銅的輸入也是逐年增加的。一九三三年輸入銅　，爲九百六十萬元。一九三四年增到二千八百四十萬元，卽增加三倍。一九三五年更增加了，輸入額爲三千七百九十萬元。因各國都在猛烈的備戰中，所以需要銅的地方更增加了。銅性軟，對於合金屬鑄物是必需的，電綫就以銅爲主。</p>
<p>其决爲錫。錫對於鐵板鍍金，合金屬物，都是很有用的。世界產量並不多，但需要在增加着，所以市價也在飛騰中。</p>
<p>其决爲鉛及亞鉛。鉛，可以不必再加精製，卽能做成鉛管，及製造硫酸的鉛室。作爲合金用，可以造成蓄電池，及印刷用的活字等。又可以用爲顏料中的化合物。用途很廣。但日本也必須輸入。一九三三年輸人一千二百萬元的鉛，一九三四年輸入一千七百九十萬元，一九三五年爲二千五十萬元，也是逐年增加的，但增加率不如鐵和銅的大。</p>
<p>亞鉛的用途爲鐵板鍍金及其他化學工業製品。日本也有相當的產量，但仍不免每年輸入亞鉛礦。不過此種輸入不多，每年平均的爲百餘萬元。市價當然也在騰漲着。主要產鉛國爲美國，墨西哥，加拿大，但離日本很遠，不好不多多購買以應急變。今年八月，鉛價賤時，百瓩值三十六元六角，現在已漲至三十九元八角。亞鉛也從三十五元漲到三十九元了。</p>
<p>一般軍需原料價格的飛騰，給大戰準備以充分的說明了。而日本是第一等積極的。</p>
<p>俗原來自一九三〇年的世界經濟恐慌發展到現在，一般的說來，世界生產指數仍未達到一九二九年的高度。就是所謂「景氣回復」，也只是「跛脚的景氣回復」。世界資本主義正害着一般的慢性麻痺症，這是毫無疑義的。但日本爲比較景氣些的一國，也是事實。因爲日本的國運，正如日本軍部所說的「已經進展」了，進展到現行政治機構都不能適應了。其實今年的日本對外貿易，就比去年减退了。所謂景氣，其實是人爲的軍需工業膨脹的景氣！</p>
<p>但一說到軍需工業的原料，必須大量輸入，重重憂色便浮到景氣的面上來了。以軍事行動去求需要的滿足，這是日本資本主義發展史的一個重要特點。倒不是今日才有的，但礦產也就不是一時便能取得，便能採出的。因此，日本軍需工業資本家的臉色，是半面狂喜半面發愁的。</p>

<p>管理米巿　平定民食</p>
<p>馬氏首謂關於高立米巿管理處、雖經相當時期之籌備、惟今後仍須注重實際之工作、使市民不受民食奇漲之痛苦、處長人選、頃已派定、今後關於倉庫之籌設、產銷之調査、價格之評定、糧食之調劑、事務頗繁、自當縝密研究、妥爲施行、馬氏對米市管理處之希望、謂調劑民食、責任甚重、尚賴各界協助進行、俾市府與市民合力尊定京市民食之基礎、</p>

<p>— 北平特信</p>
<p>座談會之名稱、原出於日本、其本來目的、在於彼此交換對於某特定問題之意見、形式上、較正式會議自由、態度上、比純粹私人間之交換意見者、又略顯嚴肅、其性質、似近似英國之費邊協社（Fabian　Society）、與法國之沙龍（Saloon）、然亦僅「近似」、不過除此以外、更無相類者而已、其實在根本上、此三者同各有其特色、逈不相侔、如費邊恊社帶有濃厚之政黨意味、沙龍則多少含有俱樂部色彩、而座談會、則於接受西洋傳來之會議形式下、頗含有東方風氣之揮塵淸談·或抵掌談天下事等成分於其中、要之、三者雖同爲側面之輿論表示、而其特徴、固一爲英國式、一爲法國式、一則爲東方式、</p>
<p>北平之有座談會、原早在數年以前、惟彼時之座談會、頗受地方當局歧視、甚至目其爲某某有作用團體之外圍組織、是以在各學校中、先後遭校中當局命令解散、社會人士組織者、亦陸續被地方當局禁止舉行、少數强項者流雖一再掙扎、勉强開會、但最後終不免解散、主持人甚至被捕、雖此等被捕之主持人、大多不旋踵又吿釋放、但已在當局前、作過不再主持此類座談會之諾言、不再活動、故直至去年十一月以前、此間幾已無座談會之存在、上述爲此間座談會之第一時期、彼時座談會意味、多少含有政治成分在內、對於推動現社會之經濟·政治·法制·等部門、以及檢討國際形勢方面、所發議論、大率激烈者居多、消極批判、多於積極建議、破壞意味、多於建設意味、藍當時風尚如此、否則卽反爲大家所誤解、故外貌觀之、似多少含有所謂作用、但試經一度老査、則大多數參加者、亦不過附同當時之風尚而已、</p>
<p>去年十一月左右、華北局面、受日方進一步壓迫、淪陷之運、刻刻可臨、漢奸宵小、麕集平津一帶、而土肥原且卜居此間東單北大街之扶桑館、（日本人開設之旅館、）每日必至當局處催促數决、聲稱計劃不實現、卽穴按照其來平時之誓言、决不離開北平、一班失意政客、下野軍閥、以及希圖茍安之市民、應從而與漢奸·宵小·輩相更和、組織團體、公開交換甘心亡國之議論、一時甚囂塵上、是時凡有血性之人、莫不痛心疾首、企圖有所表示、以與此等似爲苟安又實爲亡國之議論相對抗、但處當時情勢下、前者對後者、確具有壓倒勢力、第一次之各大學校長及敎育界名流聯名之宜言發表時、僅在僑居此間之西洋人方面、略引起衡動與同情、語其能造成與論傾向、實力則有未逮、於是此等文化界領袖、乃感於有彼此交換意見集中議論之需要、因而在彼等之問、乃有所謂俱樂部·聯歡會·等二類組織、名爲俱樂·聯歡、實則大家聚集時、除交換對時局意見、以便向國人傳述、向當局請願、向國際表示外、祇不過有時略備茶點、或略進雪茄及烟捲而已、斯雖無座談會之名、實與座談會無異、此外在各校師生間、及學生彼此之間，亦有類似組織、但其名稱、則或爲級會、或爲系會、或爲學會、實則凡所討論、亦大悉爲對時局之意見、有時備有茶點者、不過爲緩和外間之空氣而已、與其所以不用座談會名義、藉以避免外、間因對前此所謂座談會之聯想、而起種猜　者、正復一樣、故在此時期之座談會可謂爲第二個時期、亦卽座談會之雛形階段、對於「一二·九」「一二·一六」兩决之學生示威運動、有甚大之影響、</p>
<p>去年十二月、學生運動勃發、一時愛國空氣、異常濃厚、正義凜然　茍安式之亡國議論、乃爲之銷聲匿跡、一班靑年學生、又復爲熱情所激、其行動舉止、往往不獨超出一班老成碩望之名流師長期望以外、有時且連其本身之所想所信、亦一併而超越之、良以在彼時愛國在熱情勢下、一發而不克自制、亦事理之常、無足怪異、惟在彼此意見上、不免生出差異、幾有無從交換、無從討論、各行所信之象、其極端者、甚至有輕視空談、偏重行動之意、是以從去年十二月至今年一月·二月·三月·等數月內、學生運動、雖會轟動一時、再接再厲、但名爲座談會之聚會、每遇開會、非彼此喧嚷爭吵、無結果而散、卽顯然佔有優勢之一方、壓倒另一方、使其噤而不發一語、用其時流行之術語言之、即所謂給對方以打擊之謂也、名實俱符之座談會、祇有於少數意見相近之私人間、偶爾舉行、已不復能廣爲吸牧會衆矣、此爲第二時期座談會之成形階段、因其已有正式用座談會之名稱者也、然同時亦爲消沉時期、因其已成爲行動之附庸、無大緊要、至於會中可以毫無隔閡、交換不同意見、漸漸從側面造成與論傾向之座談會、時已不復存在、</p>
<p>第二時期、座談會之第三階段、開始於今年四月以後是時學生運動、受當局嚴禁、少數特別熱烈之人、又大半相率入獄、前後共達數百人、雖其後陸續獲釋、但多數已不再從事運動、此一方面之形勢也、其决、當時日方正在從事自己內部各方步調之調整、內「二·二六」政變、及內閣改組、外有駐華官憲之大大更動、無暇再給地方常局以直接壓迫、故重大刺激國人感情之事、已見减少、學生運動之行動方面在此兩方面情勢下、幾已入於停頓狀態、惟行動方面之停頓、正所以促進各方面對時局研究之熱情、於是以講演會·討論會·研究學·等名義出現、與座談會　無二致之聚會、又踵相接矣、此時各種聚會之參加者、頓形踴躍、數月來、因熱情見解不同、幾已與學生羣完全隔閡之社會名流及各校教師、此時又遂漸參加此類聚會、思想偏激者流亦因受風靡全國之所謂聯合戰綫說法所感動、在見解上、略有的束、故交換不同意見、及自出討論之事、乃日漸可能、直至九·十月間、對座談會之名稱、此類聚會中、已有大半採用十一月、綏戰旣起、予地近前錢之此間人士、以極大激刺、援綏抓動、蓬勃一時、不可響邇、究當如何援助、是乃迫切問題、故討論及交換意見之重要性、乃亦爲大家所認識、於是、凡有此類聚會、莫不一律稱之爲座談會、遇有聯合各校·各團體·或各界·開此類聚會時、且有所謂擴大座談會之舉行、至此座談會名稱、始爲社會人士普遍採用、其網羅人數之多、及開會之頻繁、較第一時期（卽去年卞一月以前者）猶且過之、同一日內、全市大小座談會、同時舉行在數個以上者、已屬司空見慣、前决休課期間、全市之社會人士·各校敎師·及學生等所舉行之聚會、而又冠以座談會名稱者、實在十僩以上、是爲第二時期「座談會」之第四階段、亦即北平自有所謂座談會以來、最蓬勃之階段、其討論問題、大率與綏戰有直接或間接關係、其交換意見對象、亦以如何援助綏戰之具體方案爲多、</p>
<p>北平第二時期座談會共有四個階段之發展、其經過時期、已如上述、但近一年來之座談會與數年前之座談會、顯有數點不同、（一）後者常含有對內意味、批判多於建議、前者在外患燃眉情形下起來、故對外情味濃厚、有時觸及對內時、亦多能移轉方向、加强對外情緒、（二）後者有固定組織、負責有專人、前者係臨時之自由集合、召集人有時亦並不固定、（三）後者參加者、學生居多、未爲社會一般所採用、前者則幾已爲全社會各種交換意見討論方案之聚會所必採形式、是名稱雖同、二者實未可相提並論、</p>

<p>— 本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>每學期校中耀行懇親會，遊藝會，成績展　會，運動會時，都發請東邀　家長來校參觀。成績報吿單每學期發出兩决，對於兒實在校的學業，行爲，出席缺席等事項，都有詳細的報吿。各校另用學校家庭通訊片一種，專爲學校與家庭通訊之用；每星期六由兒童將此片帶回家中，給家長査閱，下星期一仍由兒竄帶回校中，交敎師査閱。敎師或家長均可在通信片上簽註意見或提出問題，以便從此了解或彼此答覆。</p>
<p>有時，學校爲明瞭家長對於校中設施意向，特徴求家長意見，由校中印就書面調査表，請家長對於校中課程，敎學，訓育，管理等問題，表示具體的意見。學校當局彙集和統計家長的意見，以作改進校務的張本。對於個別的問題兒童，級任敎師常到兒童的家中訪問，藉以明瞭兒童所處的環境，並與家長共商敎導該兒童的方法。</p>
<p>十四·二部的推行</p>
<p>二十三年七月，工部局華人敎育處處長陳鶴琴先生奉派出國赴歐考察敎育。陳先生此行經歷英，法，德，意，丹麥，蘇聯諸國，爲期有七閱月之久。陳先生鍳於歐洲各國政府努力推行義務敎育，並廣設二部制學校，以助義務敎育的推行（如波蘭諸國）；乃於回國後建議工部局學務委員會，設立二部制小學，藉以推行租界內義務敎育。此項建議業經工部局採納，　於二十五年二月先在蓬路設立部制小學一所，以作初步的試辦。</p>
<p>部制小學是在利用全日制的校舍，敎帥，分上午下午兩班上課，以達到多收一倍學生的目的。每日上午和下午各上課四節，每節上課四十分鐘；所以每部學生每週可上課九百六十分鐘。在課程方面，將技　科目如工作，音樂，體育等科按照部頒時數酌量减少：同時，將知識科目如國語，算術，常識等科的復習工作設法令兒童在家中自習自做，以减少在敎室中習作的時間。</p>
<p>該校自試辦二部制以來，在敎學方面尚未感覺重大的困難。不過，因爲該校學生的家長日間多半作外做工，所以對於兒童上午或下午在家自修的工作，沒有時間加以指導和督促，因此兒童的自習工作不免受到相當的影響。還有一點，就是該校敎師所担任的工作比較其他各校敎師所担任的工作繫重；平均該校每位敎師每週的担任一千三百六十分鐘，而課外所批閱的學生課巷亦較他校敎師爲多。</p>
<p>十五·夜校概况</p>
<p>工部局鑒於公共和界內各工廠學徒的失學苦况，乃於二十三年十月先在局立荊州路小學試辦男子職工夜校一所。職工夜校招收在工廠工作的學徒，利用他們的工餘之暇，授以相當的補習敎育。學生的年齡規定自十二歲至二十歲。所授簡易的踩程有國語，書法，算術及常識（包括衛生及公民）四種。後來，爲適應　生的需要，加授英文，唱歌和體育三種選課。</p>
<p>職工夜校在開辦時共有學生二百六十四人，代表各方面的職工；共中以習製罐業，釘書業，染業，鐵工業，電燈泡製造業，印刷業和玻璃製造業的人數居多。夜校學生人數每學期均有增加；到二十五年春季，學生人數增至五百零八人，工部局鑒於夜校的發達和需要，乃於二十五年二月添辦女子職工夜校一所。該校附設於滙山路東區女子小學校舍內，專收東區各工廠的女子職工，一切設施大致與男子職工夜校相同。該校開學時卽有學生三百十人，以後當可繼續增加發展。</p>

<h3 id="c165">英鎊前途的觀察 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 包玉墀</p>
<p>自法郞貶値以後，英美法三國訂立貨幣恊定，及三國黃金輸出恊定，世界貨幣戰爭的進行，似呈休止的狀態。這兩種嶄新的貨幣協定，對於英鎊的前途，發生怎樣的影響？同時英國的平衡基金，究將採取何種政策，而調節匯兌率呢？這是英國貨幣的當前問題，急待解决。三國貨幣協定的內容，如沒有規定倫敦與紐的的余價，可說是毫無意義；換句話說，就是英錢與美元的匯率，要有一種有限度的規定。以英鎊計算的金價，如毫無限度的漲落，美國當然不至於參加協定的。假定上述的兩種貨幣恊定，俱會規定錢元匯率的限度，則在檢討英鎊的前途時，對於英國貨幣過去的環境及政策，俱有加以叙述的必要。</p>
<p>自一九三一年以來，决定鎊滙的要素，不僅是英國的貿易差額及國際收支，而是英鎊區域與其他世界各國的貿易總差額。因爲倫敦在最近五年內，已重新握住了世界金融的霸權，而成爲國際放欵的中心，英鎊區域國家的金融調劑與淸算的樞紐了。這種車實的造成，一半因爲鎊價的穩定；一半因爲英鎊區域的國家，在倫教市塲，需要維持流動資金，以便調撥。英鎊區域的國家，按季以貨物運赴倫敦，卽以其售去的貨價，國稍倫敦，於是倫敦的流動資金，遂日見增加；然英鎊區域的國家，同時因向他國輸進貨物，支付貨價的關係，以及其他種種原因，存儲倫敦的黃金與流動資金，亦有輸出的可能，而影響及於鎊滙的漲落。</p>
<p>舉例而言：一九三五年時，英國積欠外國的欵項，計達二〇五百萬鎊，這僅是商品入超的數字；此外又積欠英鎊區域的國家貨欵，共達七三百萬鎊；同時英國在一九三五年，對於英鎊區域國家的無形輸出，共有一五〇百萬鎊。兩者相衡，英國實握有債權八〇百萬鎊。英錢區域的國家，卽以貨物運銷國外，收人貨價，卽可抵冲英國的一部份入超的數宇。故英國的國際貿易，無形輸出道一項科目，很佔重要地位；而對於英鎊櫃價的上落，亦能發生嚴重的影響。在過去數年不景氣籠罩之下，英國的國際收支，非商品的科目，若黃金流動，資本移動，及運費等等，逐年呈現着明顯的變更，漸佔重要。這種事實的演變，對於英鎊常能發生很有力的影響，不渦黃金與資本的移動，有時發生在英鎊區以內，有時發生在英鎊區域與世界各國之間，其對於英鎊同樣發生影響，惟結果不同罷了。以去年而言，物價的狂漲，世界貿易的小康，航運的恢復，以及國際投機資金，自歐洲灌注美國的華爾街的畸形發展在在均足以左右鎊價的漲落，而使英國平衡基金的工作，日趨繫複艱難了。</p>
<p>時至今日，英國平衡基金的工作，更感困難因。爲倫敦對外放欵，旣在禁止之例，而英國常局，又在積極推行賤幣政策，以致維持鎊滙的步驟，遠不若昔日的簡單了。歐洲戰雲瀰漫，國際局勢，日趨緊張，英國鋼鐵及機械的生產，不敷應用，不得不向國外輸入，而商品入超的數字，遂日就膨脹。本年入超的數字，已超過去年同期的五五百萬鎊了。惟就英國的本身而言，不致發生重大的危險。因去年英國的國際收支，有貸方差額四〇百萬鎊；且英國的海外放欵，逐年都有到期償還。在一九三三年最不景氣的年頭，英國海外資金的歸流，估計的在六七百萬鎊之巨。本的數字，亦在八〇百萬鎊左右。資金歸流的結果，頗予英鎊以良好的影響，倫教的流動資金，頗形活動。而資金歸流，素來列作算商品的科目，而爲無形收入的一種。</p>
<p>如上所述，英國當局，對於無形收入這一科目，似應予以密切的注意。這一項收入的來源甚多，頭緒紛繁，包括有海外投資的利息，運費，及雜色勞役等。海外投資利息一項，據一九三四年的估計，約有一六〇百萬鎊，一九三五年商部佔計的數字，亦爲一七〇百萬鎊。運費在一九三五年的估計，爲七〇百萬鎊左右。其他零星收入，若船舶的出售，政府交易等等，亦在四〇百萬至五〇百英鎊之間。故英國的無形的收入，在國際收支方面，因爲數額的龐大，佔據重要的地位，無容否認。而間接能影響英鎊的前途，亦是鐵一般的事實。最近以來，因各國貨幣的貶値，輸入限額制的軟化，關稅壁壘的撤銷，各國經濟情况，似有欣欣向榮之兆；則英國海外投資的利息收人，或能自一九三五年之一七〇百萬鎊，提高至恐慌以前的水準三〇〇百萬鎊，亦未可知；這對於英鎊的處境，顯然是　分有利的。</p>
<p>就目前的情形而論，英國對非英鎊區域國　的貿易，如再不設法增加，則英鎊的前途，潛伏着兩大危　：第一是因美國華爾街物品交易所的吸引，英國的資金，有流出之虞；其决是商品人超的增加。以前金本位國家，因爲國內恐慌的發生，存儲倫敦的資金，現在逐漸流出歸去，道是無足輕重的，由英國平衡基金來處理對付，游刃有餘。至於傾流華爾街的資金，經過嚴密的調整管理，亦極易阻止。惟有增加商品的輸出，確是一個不易解决的難題。據專家的估計，本年商品的入超，將較去年超過七五百萬鎊，實際的超過數字，恐將更大。至海外投資收入的增加，僅的一〇至二〇百萬鎊左右；而運費的收入，亦僅增加一〇至一五百萬鎊。其餘的收入，足以抵冲入超的數字的，祇有資本移動一項了。資本移動，已是决定英鎊强弱的重要因素了。</p>
<p>根據上面的叙述，英鎊的前途，至爲危急，如果華爾街在最近的將來，能平平穩穩，不再掀風作浪，則英鎊在本年以內，當能歸於穩定。惟一九三七年的　國，新近貶値的國家，及世界商品市塲，其將來　在不可知之數，故英鎊前途的凶吉，殊未能先期判定。惟英國平衡基金的工作，將更趨困難，則已爲明顯的事實，無可否認的了。</p>
<p>英鎊自參加一國貨幣協定，訂立紳士條欵後，鎊匯在近數月內，當不致有嚴峻的上落。對美滙兌，近來盤　在四元八角九分左右，似嫌過高；如果無形收人，再不能有實質的增加，則英美匯兌，勢將有相反的發展。所以各國的金價，最好能獲得一合理的輸出入點，法美瑞士等國，已經有所規定，英國如亦能規定一種限度，復益以關稅的减低，匯兌基金的合作，不僅　國的貨幣，可以步入康莊的大道，卽世界整個的貨幣制度，亦可以奠定了健全的基礎。</p>
<h3 id="c166">銀行信用小放欵的檢討 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 唐桐孫</p>
<p>（一）普通銀行業務的梗概</p>
<p>銀行的設立，是現代社會集團生活的一種產物。牠負起調劑金融的食任，因此牠的業務也就在資金的供需上周旋。不過我們要明白銀行是現代經濟社會必需要的一種繼關，我們必得先把銀行所營業務大略地說說，再來談到本文所要討　的信用小放欽業務。</p>
<p>簡單地講起來，銀行就是經營存欵與放欵的兩種主要業務。其他如匯兌信託等等，前者不過是調劑兩地金融，帮助銀行達到其任務，後乾就是銀行靠牠　已，是個信用機關來代客服務。</p>
<p>（甲）存欵是存欵是銀行的命脈，簡言之銀行所以能調劑余融者，亦唯有其能運用存欵來貸於跌少資金的人，存欵的種類的有下列五種：</p>
<p>（一）活期存欵</p>
<p>一，商業銀行的活期存欵</p>
<p>二，儲蓄銀行的活期存欵</p>
<p>（二）定期存欵</p>
<p>一，複利存欵（卽整存整取存欵）</p>
<p>二，零存整取存欵</p>
<p>三，整存零取存欵</p>
<p>四，存本付息存欵</p>
<p>（三）通知存欵</p>
<p>（四）票據存欵</p>
<p>（五）暫時存欵</p>
<p>銀行的活期存欵，在銀行本身方面，實在沒有什麼利益，牠旣需要充分的準備以便隨時支付，而手續又繁，惟在存欵者方面，却有極大的便利，凡商人公司其每日收入之銀錢，倘自己保管難免有不測之慮，故一旦存入銀行作活期存欵，自己旣不需要負保管的風險，而支付又便利，且還有若干利息可取，這又何樂而不爲？而在銀行本身，旣以調劑金融目任，那就不能嫌手續繁雜了。</p>
<p>其决是定期存欵，這方面的存戶大都可以分爲下列幾種</p>
<p>（一）有資金而無投資經騐者；</p>
<p>（二）凡普通職工之所獲，因數目甚小，故零星存儲以冀積少成多者。</p>
<p>此種存欵，因其無需準備，故可十足把來運用，所以銀行使用資金的來源，以定期存欵爲最多。</p>
<p>其他如票據存欵通知存欵暫時存欺等，也不過是銀行使用種種方法來吸取資金之一種罷了！</p>
<p>（乙）放欵－簡括起來，放欵大的有三種</p>
<p>（一）票據的貼現</p>
<p>（二）抵押放欵</p>
<p>一，不動產抵押放欵</p>
<p>二，動產抵押放欵</p>
<p>（三）信用放欵</p>
<p>一，担保的信用放欵</p>
<p>二，無担保的信用放欵</p>
<p>前面早經講過，銀行是吸收並集中各方的資金，而又散發資金，所以放欵業務也就是散發資金的方法。</p>
<p>貼現的意義，是銀行收買未到期的票據，由買進日起算至到期日止，按當市利率算出應扣的利息，以現欵兌給持票人也。普通銀行所貼現的票據，的有五種</p>
<p>（一）由生產或製造業者對批發商發出之票　；</p>
<p>（二）由批發商對零售商發出之票據；</p>
<p>（三）由消費者另售商對發出之票據；</p>
<p>（四）銀行的本票，滙票，及錢莊的莊票，滙票。</p>
<p>前列第一，二，三，種票據，卽目前銀行所做之商業承兌匯票及各種進出口押匯等；第四種的票據卽市塲上最普通的貼現票據。</p>
<p>貼現放欵，其時期大都甚短，而較長的放欵，惟爲抵押放欵及信用放欵兩種。抵押放欺中以不動產抵押放欵時期較長，這種放欵，大都以工廠的廠基，土地，房屋，生財等爲担保品；動產放欵却大都以商品，公債庫券，股票，公司債票，生金銀等爲担保品。其次關於信用放欵方面，一種是有保證人的信用放欵，一種是無保證人的信用放欵，這種放欵的形成，在吾國以前的錢莊時代，就已發達到極頃。吾國數百年來內地農商之調劑，實在全賴錢莊的信用放欵。可是海通以來，外國金融業皆以押匯押欵業爲主，加以近年來世界不景氣潮流彌漫中國，這種信用放欵也就大减其色了。</p>
<p>（二）銀行設立信用小放欵的原因其辦法</p>
<p>銀行吸取資金的方法，正是用盡心思來招徠生意。牠設立了各種儲蓄存欵方法以吸零星小數，於是在銀行集中資金一方面，已達到中下階級的人民人，甚至更平民化的銀行，再派人到學校工廠中去吸取學生及工人的剩餘儲蓄。不過我們觀察銀行散發資金方面，却沒有見到如此地普遍平民化。尤其在目前中國經濟極度恐慌的時代，我們只聽見銀行緊縮放欵，就是普通所見到的，也不過幾家大工廠大商店的抵押放欵，至於一般小工廠小商家，他們本來可藉錢莊的信用放欵來維持，而現在呢！市面不同，時勢更易，錢莊本身，發生困難中，還有何處來的信用放欵？因此市面不景氣更甚，商業凋零，只看見商店倒閉，少見新開，還有一般專靠薪金或工齊生活的大衆，他們也受淸經濟恐慌的影響，同時生活程度又一天天地提高，他們平日維持生活，已是不十分容易，假使偶而逾到什麽意外的事故或有正當的用途時，就束手無策了，於是如印子錢，圈子利，猴兒跳，以及種種的重利盤剝，大家明知不可入彀，可是無可奈何之時，只好硬硬頭皮去借一卜，結果經濟壓迫日甚一日，直到最無辦法的時候，强者挺而走險，弱者所受的苦痛，不能盡述，這種情形，當然以都市中來得最發達最明顯。於是上海的少數銀行，因鑒於這種情形，就創設信用小放欵，以救濟一般憑藉薪金生活和小工廠小商家的急需，這就是信用小放欵的產生。</p>
<p>信用小放欵在外國實在早已盛行，卽是美國許多很普通的銀行，牠們放出幾白萬的信用小放欵，實在不是樁可驚的事，還有許多企業家也以信用小放欵的方法來推銷他們的商品，我們只要看近來汽車，無綫電收音機，脚踏車的交易，都有一種分期付欵的辦法，這就是信用少放欵的變相。上海辦理信用小放欵的銀行首推上海商業儲蓄銀行的靜安寺路分行，大的於民國十九年二月開辦，其後至民國二十二年四明儲蓄會開辦及中級信用信託公司開幕，都營小額信用放欵業務。某後新華信託儲蓄銀行，南市通商銀行，永大銀行及已淸理之通易信託公司，寗波實業銀行等，還有許多私人組織的機關，都辦理信用小借欵，至今匕不下十餘家。</p>
<p>現在就放欵機關的章程來看，大概有以下幾點的共同點。</p>
<p>（一）借欵人資格－凡居住上海，年滿二十一歲的公民，在服務或所營公司或店舖任職六個月或經營一年以上者，可得享受。</p>
<p>（二）借額－大都從五十元起至五百元，間或有幾家自一百元至五百元或一千元者。</p>
<p>（三）利息－利率大都在月息六釐至九釐之間按日計算，並於借欺成立時預扣。</p>
<p>（四）借欽時期－拔還期限最長以一年爲限，每月平均攤還，例如借欵一百二十元，則每月拔還十元。目此種還欵須按一定日期繳納，假使每日訂定月底還欵，則必須於月底拔還，不得延遲。</p>
<p>（五）担保－保證人大都需二人，其資格與借欵人相仿，保證人以後的食任對欠欵須與借欵人負速帶及單獨的責任。</p>
<p>（六）調査費－借欵人於申請借欵之際，須憑銀行調查信用，所以是項調查費，也得由借欵人負担，其數額大都於借欵成立時扣借欵之百分之一，亦有於申請借欵時預　者。</p>
<p>（七）愆期還欵－前面已說過，此種借欵，其拔還須按預定之某日還欵，但一旦借欵人愆期不付，則銀行須另收手續費及過期利息，手續費最少是五角最多是一元，過期利息以按月一分計算。</p>
<p>（八）提前拔還－借欵人可以在規定子前一日次全部淸償，且得退還一部份利息。</p>
<p>（九）借欵手續－借欵者先向銀行接洽，並須經銀行口頭訊問，假使經認爲資格尙符，當卽發給婦借欵申請書」，則借欵人卽可邀同保人詳細塡就交銀行以憑調查，以後再由銀行直接通知可借與吾。大　手續，就如上述。</p>
<p>（三）信用小放欵的內容檢討</p>
<p>信用小放欵是以分期拔還爲原則，而以信用爲　保，因此　覺得在借貸者方向，實在有下列幾點利益：</p>
<p>（一）信用担保－就目前中國情形來講，錢莊的信用放欵已爲時代所掏汰，普通銀行的信用放欵，只及於小數信用卓著的殷實商店，所以個人或小企業要想享受這種優待，實在不是樁可能的事，現在只要有兩人的担保就可以享受這種權利，這無異是提高民衆的經濟地位及信用</p>
<p>（二）分期付欵－這種放欵，以分期拔還的方法，在借欵人方面，每月只須拔還借欵的幾分之一，自然於不知不覺中將借欵全部還淸。</p>
<p>（三）養成守信的習慣－這種放欵，都是規定每　每日付欵或得延　數日，假使過了所定日子還欵，就須繳納罰余（手續費）。所以借欵人自得按期還欵，這樣一來暗中養成借欵人的守信習慣。</p>
<p>（四）養成儲蓄習慣－依照分期還欵的方法，借欵人於不知不覺中拔還欠欵，那末以後終可每月集聚零星小欵儲蓄起來，以備日後急需之用，這不是養成一種儲蓄習慣嗎！</p>
<p>其决在銀行方面，也有下列各點的利益：</p>
<p>（一）資金流動－不論商店銀行，最怕的一件事就是資金不得流動，銀行是調接金融的機關，他對於資金的流動，自然更應注意，以前我們常見什麼銀行倒閉，什麽銀行淸理，實在牠們不都是負債過甚，而資金不得流動。却是個大原因。所以近來銀行都少做不動產抵押放欵，也是個顯著的例子。可是道種信用小放欵，却適合銀行胃口，牠們把欵子放出去，每月都有收回，因此隨時可以收放，這種川流不息，業務旣可擴大，資金又得流通。</p>
<p>（二）利息優厚－就目前的幾家放欵機關來看，其利率表面上只有月釐六釐至九釐，但實際上算來，超過　息一分五釐以上（算法詳後），而普通的放欵，其利率最高也不過一分　釐左右，所以從信用小放欵上面，實在有大宗的利息可得。</p>
<p>（三）債權穩固－</p>
<p>一，這種放欵，保證人至少需二人，且須與借欵連帶或單獨負責，所以三人之中卽使有人發生變故，而在其他二人之間，也不難我人賠償。</p>
<p>二，這種放欵，大都訂定「違的金」，這意思是借欵人以後如果發生不還等情，銀行追索欠欵而所受之損失，借欵人應負担違的金按照借額之百分之二十計算。</p>
<p>三，時期短促－大概現在的小放欵，其拔還期間　多不過一年，故時間也較其他放欵爲短。</p>
<p>以上所說，是就大體而論，假使我們再從辦法上再加探討，也不無可資研究的地方。</p>
<p>（一）利率太高－信用放欵目前的利率雖都在月息六釐到九釐之間，如詳細地計算一下，覺得放欵的利率實在太高。現在不妨舉個例子來說明：</p>
<p>假使同銀行借用一百元，利率是按月七釐半按日計算，那末一年（三百六十五天）應扣利息是九元一角三分，所以實際上銀行貸出只有九十元八角七分（　100．913　90－87），到第一月月底，借欵人還八元三角三分，所以到第一個月底銀行放出的本金只有八十二元五角四分（　9087　8－38　　82－54）就這樣推算，且把他無列如下：</p>
<p>時間　銀行所放本金數</p>
<p>初借白元（扣息）　九〇·八七</p>
<p>第一月底　二八·五四　　第二月底　七四二·二一　　第三月底　六五·八八</p>
<p>第四月底　五七·五五　　第五月底　西九·二二　　第六月底　四〇·八九</p>
<p>第七月底　三二·五六　　第八月底　二四·三三　　第九月底　一五·九〇　　第十月底　七·五七</p>
<p>第十一月底　（减·七六）</p>
<p>假使再拿銀行放出的本金數平均一下</p>
<p>所以我們拿幾種利率計算一下，又得下表，皆以借欵一百元期限十二個月作爲計算標準</p>
<p>（二）利息預扣－按普通放欵，除貼現息外，其利息大都與欠欵一同歸還，而這種小放欵的利息也須先扣，在銀行方面殊無理由可言，所以有不明眞相者，甚至謂剝削榨取，不過就現在的利率看來，似乎較市上印子錢的利息爲輕，倘能冉减小利率，一方面將應收利息隨本金一同分期拔還，更似比較合理，則對於借欵人負担較輕而與銀行仍無若何損失。</p>
<p>（三）拔還時期太短－信用小放欵，大都以一年爲限，假　每月薪金百元左右的人，借欵三百元，則其每次還欵須二十五元，因此他每月須將薪金的四分之一來還欵，則對於彼個人或一家的生活，必感難於應付，結果東借西還，債務日深。故倘能將借欵期限延長至一年半或二年，則借欵人每月負擔旣少，亦易於應付矣。</p>
<p>（四）結論</p>
<p>以上所論，不過就信用小放欵的原則及辦法上加以申論，我們雖經提出應加改良之點，就大體言，信用小放欵在提倡守信美德上以及養成儲蓄習慣上已建了不小的功績，而且這種放欵，容易普及到一般中下階級的民衆，因此在銀行本身，的確更可顯得牠調劑金融服務社會的本能，而於市民方面，却眞得到經濟恐慌的救星。</p>

<p>— 錢大</p>
<p>革命先進尤列先生，入京未久，卽吿殂化，聞者無不惜之。先生生前、與總理及陳少白楊鶴齡倡導革命，有四大寇之號，迨總理陳楊，先後逝世，先生乃爲革命老輩中之魯殿靈光矣。當先生由港來滬時，寓友人譚海秋君住宅，愚嘗數往謁晤，以逾古稀之年，遭航途風浪之勞，精神乃至委頓，見者因悉爲先生憂也。厥後，體稍康復，因念總理心切，急欲晋京謁陵，乃於九月二十三日夜，偕秘書隨從，命駕入都，是夕，外間知者絕鮮，赴車站送行者，僅愚及譚海秋君等三數人而已。臨歧先生猶握手殷殷道後會，不圖從此一別，竟成千古可悲也。先生人京後，於二十六日，卽偕立法委員馮自由等，舉行祭陵，該文似尙未見各報，茲特錄而出之，以供本報讀者。此文感念故友，復悲身世，感慨沉鬱，令入讀之氣結，無怪先生讀未及半，卽悲不自勝，淚溢聲咽，不能復續也。原文如后：</p>
<p>維中華民國二十五年九月二十六日，允列謹獻好花，致祭於孫總理中山我兄之靈曰：曩者公挈陳楊，並及於列；革命倡言，晨夕快悅：意氣相期，滿腔血熱，鼓吹游揚，大義期揭；初事廣州，密謀竟泄；奔走海外，含辛茹藥；再接再厲，不可屈鉄；志士從風，灑幾許血，染成民國，淸社以滅；維公之功，人誰敢竊；護法軍興，開府南越；邀參大計，遭讒咀齧；僅一相見，頓成永訣。窀穸奉安，恨未臨穴；抱玉悲號，知音絃絕；嗚呼痛哉！鶴齡少白，相繼摧折；撫茲一身，形單影孑；矧丁國難，嚴重日切；覯閔旣多，氣彌蘊結；紫金食烟，松揪凌雪；今來哭公，曷勝戚咽；獻花酬酒，其歆芳潔；尙饗！</p>

<p>這裏我所說的「標準自鳴鐘，並不是黃浦江邊江海關天天報時的標準鐘却是一位頂瓜瓜十足老牌」在鄉下當教員的好好先生。他本姓胡，名呌澄，據說這個雅號的成名，倒也不是偶然的，因爲他在上課的時候，並不帶什麽表，上到相當的時間，旣無須出來偸瞧鐘頭，也用不到校役　鈴，他自會得不早不晚，恰如地位呌級長喊起禮退了；所以別級裏的教師們，只要瞧到他跨出課堂門，大家也都就跟着退課，一分一秒不會差，眞是再準確也沒有咧</p>
<p>他愛好喝酒喫鼻烟，鼻子管常塗得墨般黑教課之外，還充當保長職司，有一次，他和貴區長鬧意見，那區長漏夜把他大門口的一塊「第×保保長辦公處」的大牌子撬了下來，意在革掉他頂戴，滑稽得很！當時他只做不知道，不慌不忙地跑到公安局裏去，報告保長牌子被竊，鬧出一塲笑話，所以人家又呌他爲撬牌保長。</p>
<p>他爲人很誠實，辦事很劃一；但只因他太劃一的緣故，一隻破飯碗，險些兒摜碎！記得某年秋季，本省各縣督學交互視察的當兒，某督學蒞鄉之日，恰巧是星期日，照例不上課；乃該督學竟異想天開，硬要他召集學生到校，上課給他看，省得來三去四，當時他堅執不可！只管坐在涵店裏喝酒聽之，豈知不到二月，教局「××××」的訓令就來到了，其實星期日上課，倒也宋之前聞吧！</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>嬌生貴養的金魚，到了冬天，那護養法是不可不注意的。否則受寒氣的刺激，金魚很易犯鬆鱗的毛病。或魚身發着斑點，漸致潰爛，一如人們的患凍瘃，欲免道種弊患，非從專冬圍不可，冬圍的方法，便是把缸半埋泥土中，晚間在缸面上藍較厚的蘆簾，藉以避免霜雪，缸之四面，再用稻草園纔。這時魚已入半眠狀態中，食量已銳减，就是不給它吃，也不致餓死，若已犯了中寒的病，那麽速栘至日光中，使受相當的熱度，或用電燈射照，也很有益。</p>
<p>一昨晤見了韓君寄隱，他是藝魚專家，特關園在南市斜土路局門路西，佔地若千畝，養魚數十百缸，名爲「非園」。鄙人於夏間，會去參觀過一决，名種很多，確是罕見之品，這回晤見了，我就問他「非園之魚，別來無恙否」他說：「在這冬天，照顧金魚，是很費事的。北方來的魚，尙能耐得寒氣。那珍珠魚等，是南方來的，稍一受寒，便致凍斃」。所以他每日近午時，必將缸水舀夫，使之極淺，那麼日光曝照，自較有力，午後把水漸漸加滿，那麽晚間結冰，祗結浮面一層，魚潛伏在下面，絲毫不受影響，明晨將冰除去，也很容易。冬季的水，不易變　，不必時常更換，若更換時，須新水較老水溫度稍高，否則魚也要致病的。他搜羅異種，不遺餘力，近來添有「藍望天球」，「藍龍種球」，「藍虎頭」，「五花虎頭，等，北方友人某，蓄有「紫羅蘭球」，他艷疾的了不得。向某求售，可是某不忍割愛，他知道某是嗜畫成癖的，便將家藏的一幅潘雅聲仕女，送至某處。某始將「紫蘭羅球」若干尾，作爲酬報，如今已蓄在非園中了，他每逢土日二曜，必在園中，接待藝魚同志，且邀鄙人再去鑒賞一番，並說紫羅蘭會主人，當然喜歡「紫羅蘭球」的，能偕着同去，尤爲歡迎呢。</p>

<p>國器道：我早就說你原來就很豪爽，當然這是你一番俠氣，只是……他把話音拖得很長，預備接着說一句較宛轉的話。那一句話一時未曾想出，他就望了簾子下所透出窗戶外的一錢日影。友梅道：只是表兄决想不到他是這樣的身世吧？我本來不願把這事告訴你，但夢蘭的意思，以爲這事不便形之於楮墨，他又不願欺人，所以示意於我，讓我轉舌。我想吿訴表哥也好。這才證明彼此是道義之交。而且表哥對於這樣一個文章知已，要怎樣的去安慰，也明白多了。國器無故的微微一笑，又歎了一。氣。友梅道：至於那枚戒指，完全是我的意思，我以爲書信往來，全靠郵寄，太不妥當，我願出來，替雙方通消息。但要讓我在雙方面傳信，必須有一樣東西，讓我帶給你，才可以證明。自然我一邊是親戚，一邊是最好的同學，我也願二位的交誼，更是堅定。表哥的感想怎麽樣？國器道：是我先寫信給江小姐的。我雖不能帮助人家什麼，也不能去增加人家的痛苦。我本來預備了一點東西回答他的。這樣說來，我不必送了。友梅道：爲什麽呢？表哥得了這個消息，心裏很不痛快嗎？國器道：我在他文字裏，老早也就知他是不幸的女子，就彼此以文字道義之交相的。旣然如此，得了這個消息，就不痛快，也只是爲他可惜罷了。决非是我自己，有了什麼不痛快。我所以要把送他是給他一個紀念，現在我覺得他不必要紀念品了。話談到了這裏，氣氛覺得很是緊張，但是國器的熊度，反而是很悠閑，在書桌抽屜裏，取出了一柄湘妃竹柄摺扇，展了開來，慢慢的在胸前　着。雖然那把扇子是自己常用的，對於那扇面上的書畫好像也是初次看到一般，將扇子揮動了幾下，就托着扇子看看。臉上雖然有那驚慌的樣子，但是他借着看扇面的行爲來把這驚慌遮掩過去。友梅斜坐在他對過，也是將脇下紐扣上掖的一條手絹，放在大腿膝蓋上，綏綏的折疊着。他那蘋果似的臉皮，也加增了一層紅色。把眼皮子垂了下來。他忽然一笑道：我說這些話，好像多事。但是江小姐託我把他的身世吿訴給表哥，我不能不說。（一〇九）</p>

<p>男女變性這件事，確在近代醫學史上佔着極重要，而又極新奇的一頁。要不是有着事實的證明，誰都不會相信眞有這麽同事，定以爲是隨意揑造的無穡之談。年前，曾有一津籍老人宣佈其孫女忽變爲男孩，因而哄動一時，傳爲奇談，但其秘密立卽被揭發，實則此老不過想藉此以騙川資而已。可是在外國，確然已發生過男女變性的確有事實，茲略將這些變性的故事，記載一些下面。</p>

<p>我由道種捐衣運動聯想到唐代伸張國威時候的一個動人故事。足見以寒衣慰勞抗敵將士是在古代已被採用過。唐代的尙武精神在中華民族　上表現着最光榮的一頁，——元代淸初在異族統治下的擴張版圖是不能與唐代的民族自　精神相比擬。唐代在五胡亂華之後，當時漢族的危機與今日我國虞境略同。在外患激刺下的民族自衛精神一定很高張，道在唐代徵兵制度上可以看出，那時是全民武裝以衛國土的，在傳說事蹟上，薛仁貴郭子儀等的英勇至今還彼稱道着，我所要提到的是當時苦戰塞北的士兵，是受到怎樣的優遇。這故事大意是；守邊將士的寒衣由皇帝命內廷宮女親自縫裁，其中有一位宮女由於久處宮禁的寂寞，及羨慕邊防兵士英勇的兩種心理，便情不自禁地寫了一首愛慕的情詩，夾在纊衣內寄給任何一個穿着的征人，許着來生願結夫婦的願望。那是在不可能環境下的一種痴情，但是後來發現這首詩的軍士，怎敢領受這件衣裳呢？於是呈到皇宮，請旨定奪，結果唐皇非但不加罪，反將寄詩的宮女許嫁該征人，以資鼓勵。這故事不僅是唐皇高興下所造成的佳話，事實上包括很重大的意義，窮一，徵兵制度下的士兵，－－尤其是防邊禦外的士兵，是如何在民衆心理上受到崇拜，第二，兵士的寒衣爲何不由民間購製，而必由宮女們親自縫裁，那是表示唐皇對待士兵的優渥，而鼓勵　衛國精神，至於許配之事不過是藉此機會，表示唐皇在民族的立塲上，是如何重武士而輕美人。我們可以推想那時的將士，是如何受着感動而更激發其愛國精神。</p>
<p>現在中國民族受外侮的壓迫，允甚於唐代，當此民族安危千鈞一髮之際，民衆是國家的主人，難道不應該關心邊防將士的苦戰精神嗎？因此各地在節用，節食，節衣之下，援助綏軍，可謂天經地義，義不容辭。同時由於上述故事的啟示，我相信邊防士兵需要物質援助之外，允需要精神的鼓勵。他們沒有功夫看報，不能直接感受到全國民衆廣大的同情，假使能够捐助絨綿衣十萬件，（即使是舊的）不但可以增加了他的戰壕中禦寒的力量，尤其可以使他們直覺地感到有十萬後方民衆，從身上解衣捐助，父是由十萬婦女親手織製，雖是不値多錢，都是各人平素很珍惜的內衣，居然不遠千里地移贈於邊防將士，每件衣裳都寄着無限的愛國熱情，這種精神感動的力量，比一切的援助還要偉大。我希望援綏會在勸募金錢捐助之外，不可忽視這捐衣運動的精神效果，而加以妥愼的採用，以便迅見實行。</p>

<h3 id="c180">日報論中日關係 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>九日本報譯載了日文上海日報關於中日問題的一篇社論，批評日本自命爲「中國通」在對華認識之錯誤，其重要語句有云；「夫輕蔑對手，而欲提携親善，其能收效乎…良以彼輩就二三十年前中國的頭腦，而論中國，已大非其時矣。」過去日本政論家室伏高信氏到中國，也曾發表一篇關於中日問題的論文，認爲日本軍人以急進方法進入中國，是一種錯誤，和我們主張五十年後抗敵論者的口氣一樣，意下要以軟的方法使中國人民自然悅康共王道。這意見深爲我國一些只圖目前快樂者所歡迎，一致稱贊室伏高信氏的言論是「正論」。現在上海日報雖並未也勸日本軍人以軟的方法使中國人民自然悅服其王道，但在此時此地，居然能批評日本政策是一種錯誤，單就這一點而論，已足使我們聞之而「受寵若驚」了。</p>
<p>上海日報指出，現在的中國，已非二三十年前的中國，就這一句，我們認爲是對的。但其所認爲不同，郤並非就是我們之所認爲不同。比如，現在中國靑年，已再無吸鴉片的了，這並不能代表現在中國與以前中國不同的區分所在。例是近二三十年來，中國一般民衆，深受日本武力之敎訓，特別是九一八以來，這痛苦的認識是太深刻了。單就這一次全國不分上下遠近，一致自動以最大的熱力，援助綏遠抗匪的運動而說，在二三十年前中國是决不會有的。這還是一個小小開端，若更擴大起來，蘊蓄在中國地層下的民衆偉力是無窮盡的。也許正因爲此，友邦比較聰明一些的論者，就不得不勸日本軍人自己稍爲留心一些脚步罷。我們正要更擴大這民衆的偉力，使侵略者自己發覺走的道路是一條絕路！</p>
<p>然而友邦的中國通，也有並未認識錯誤的地方。比如，利用鄭孝胥殷汝耕等輩，以問接統治中國，這是最聰明的辦法，已行之而收大效，且可永遠利用。這一點，上海日報却是沒有指出的，我們値得在這里代爲補充說明。</p>
<p>中日兩國民衆，本無互相仇恨的必要。我們深知日本一般民眾，對於我們的受人侵略，也非常予以同情的。成爲兩大民族的重要隔閡的，是少數高踞社會上層的自私自利者。我們以最大敬意歡迎友邦目光遠澈的知識份子把這層隔閡努力挑破。但四五年來。在友邦的所有報紙雜誌（　密的除　）上，我們只見或多或少鼓吹侵略的文字，至多，是緘口不談。日本有希望的知識份子到那裏去了呢？</p>
<h3 id="c181">海行 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>二月，渤海解凍了。海面上飄浮着的冰塊，順着風勢相互碰擊着，在虎虎地吼着的北風里，汽笛接連地尖呌了三聲，船啟椗了。</p>
<p>碼頭上叢集着的入們，他們那雜亂的聲音以及遠處的車輛，棧房，高矗的烟囱，全都漸離漸遠了。在薄霧的籠罩之下，岸上的人們看來就像幽靈一般，黃昏的燈光却像含淚的巨眼。我們的輪船緩緩地開動着，它是朝大連開去的。</p>
<p>在船頭，海浪怒號着，時時把冰冷的水沫飛濺到甲板上來。我們大夥兒都蹲在甲板上面。其中有幾個手裏挾着一捲棉絮，背上挽着一個包袱，正蹲在鐵欄干的近旁，用着倔强的姿態去抵抗刺骨的海風。電燈還沒有亮，甲板上是一片黑暗。風蓬在風聲里不斷地撲撲的饗着。</p>
<p>我是甲板上一個唯一的帶着手提箱的人，在入羣里，人家用着羨慕的和驚奇的眼色望着我。在我的近旁，一個莊稼人啣着長長的，汕得發亮的烟管，時時向我噴出一陣陣辛辣的烟來。我偶而也望望他們一眼，每一决他都避開我的視綫。等到我掏出香烟來，向他借洋火的時候，他才用一種帶着「兒」的尾音的腔調，低低地問着我說：</p>
<p>「是上關東去的？您是……」</p>
<p>「不，我是要到靑島去的，順便到大連看看朋友。」</p>
<p>「您老是在北京城唸書的？呃？」</p>
<p>「是的。今年個到大連去的人眞個少了，是不是？」</p>
<p>「不，多着呢。成千成萬的人都上關外去，關外眞是好地方，是咱們吃飯的地方呀！可是聽說今年有許多人給攆走了，有好些人也沒半點訊息，聽說，……」他湊上來低低地說「有許多入給斃了啦，可是我們誰個也煞不住，咱們窮人，顧到口來就顧不得命啦。」他說着，聲音分外陰沉。</p>
<p>「您老今年……」</p>
<p>「呵，五十八了。過了五十，也拖磨不久了啦！有一天過就算一天。您說是不是？」</p>
<p>「找活幹用得着跑到關外去麽？聽說關外近來險得很呢。」</p>
<p>「不錯，找活幹本來用不着跑到關外去。我在北京城，濟南府這兩個地方，一年來到處找活兒，那里有？關外還是老地方，走熟路强似走生路。險麽？咳，現在的世路，管不上那麽許多了。」</p>
<p>我沉默着。這老人的話語每一句都打着我的心窩。我抬起頭來，輪船已駛出港外來了。欄杆外面是一片無限的黑暗。堅在船中間的主檣，它的尖端像挿入天空的陰雲去似的。海更加有力地在翻滾着。</p>
<p>周圍的入多半已熟睡了，有些更發出了低沉的鼾聲，有幾個睡的時候，身子不斷地戰抖着，那鼾聲聽來就像病人的呻吟一樣。</p>
<p>「您老穿的少，太凉了吧？我問。</p>
<p>「嗯！有一點今晚的海風眞怪，像長着刺呢！咳。不過，凍也受够的。那一天冬天，咱們好些兄弟們在撫順坑里當小工，那才凍得要命哩。接連三晚下了大雪，蓬寮壓坍了。有幾個弟兄在那一回凍死了。咱只記得凍得動彈不得，連喊救也喊不出來，嘴吧像給鬼用手堵住一樣。隔天淸早，同坑的弟兄們才把我們救了出來。從此之後，工也作不成了。才轉到哈爾濱，在白毛子的廠里作了凈三年的工。直到九一八。三年，凈凈三年，出廠的時候連一個大子兒也沒有！咳白毛子黃毛子全一樣的狠，兄弟們全這麼說。」他嘆了一口長長的氣。「有許多一同出來的兄弟們，現在全都沒了啦，想起來眞是。……」他低下頭去，我們全沒有開聲，死寂佔據了整個的甲板。</p>
<p>機器的鬧聲伴着東北風，瘋狂地在吼着。我們都戰慄着。</p>
<p>驟然，老人欠起身子，移到我身邊來，用着低低的聲音向着我說：</p>
<p>「先生，您是讀書人，吿訴我吧，咱幾時才能出頭呢？咱們吃黃毛子的苦痛還不够麽？」他睜着眼睛望着我，我渾身冷戰起來。</p>
<p>甲板上，海面上還是一片無垠的黑暗。在遠遠的那邊，燈塔的光茫似隱似現的在探射着。</p>
<h3 id="c182">拳擊 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 因非</p>
<p>或人書柬</p>
<p>朋友：我太興奮了。看了拳擊比賽之後，隨了人羣散出到門口，我發覺我的兩手全是汗，臉熱辣辣地發着燙，風吹上來，覺不到牠的冷，但覺得凉颼颼地怪好受用。</p>
<p>興奮地回到了家，興奮地上了床，費了很大的力，費了一個多小時的時間，我總算入睡了，但入睡以後，我給太興奮的神經笑醒了過來，我做了夢。</p>
<p>我夢着我也做了拳擊手。我的對手要比我高大得多强壯得多，因之我祗有招架的工夫而沒有還擊的機會，但就是招架，我也招架不過來，我給打得滿臉是血，但我還是不能不招架，因爲不招架將被打得更厲害，對手是决不會因爲你的流血而不招架而不進攻的。我祗有拚命招架，乘機會，我也揮着我的瘦小的拳頭向對方奮然一擊，雖然有落空，但有時也能打着一下，我就是在打着了對方一下，見他臉上也流了血而高興得笑醒過來的</p>
<p>醒過來以後，我不自覺的摸了摸臉，臉是燙熱的？和看了拳擊賽散出來的時候一樣，下意識地看一看手，看有沒有血？却沒有。我才覺得我剛才是夢，現在正睡在溫暖的被窩裏，不過，我的耳旁却到現在還響　旁觀者的吶喊聲，那吶喊是爲了鼓勵强者的進攻而起的，並不是同情弱者。當有一方面受了重重的一搫，吶喊聲便從四座森起來了，他們並沒有偏袒　一方面，祗要你能够把對方面打到，這吶喊便是爲你而起的，我的耳旁現在正響着這瘋在似的呼喊，但我分不淸這究竟是向我不威還是向我鼓勵？</p>
<p>現在正是午夜，連黎明大概還有些時候吧？天又很冷，寫了這些我想依舊睡了，睡了之後是否還會做拳擊的夢呢？不知道，就做吧，我也將欣然的去做，這樣的夢我現在並不怕了，就卽使再給打得頭破而流，我也將繼續打下去，因爲我明白了我必須打下去的理由：不打是將會更被打的。</p>
<p>那瘋狂的吶喊聲又在響了，這聲音現在聽來，我覺得有些可愛，那不是誘惑，但却是個威脅，也可說，它是一個警吿。</p>
<p>它警吿弱者必須鬥下去！</p>

<p>— 朱露</p>
<p>——憶八達嶺</p>
<p>當列車像蛇一樣游過了三個山洞，那帶似的居庸關落後了，列車到達了靑龍橋，就停在山谷裏了。</p>
<p>北國的風沙，是世界馳名的，當踏着沙礫，跑上了斜坡，跨着石階，爬上了那偉大的長城，塞外的風沙，吹得格外的厲害，吹得旅人的衣裳，發出繂　的聲響，大風捲起了沙灰，刮得天空也迷濛起來了。</p>
<p>在長城上，踏着一方方的大石磚走着，在城牆上，好多磚石殘缺了，長城高低起伏得像大波浪一樣，當一陣風沙刮着，那山嶺就像在迷霧裏一樣。</p>
<p>在城上遙望着斜坡，在荒凉深黃色的沙土裏，有着一個邨落。</p>
<p>當跑上一座哨望臺，依着缺口，望着沒有邊似的寨外，那無垠，冷落，的沙漠，開展開來，在深黃的沙土裏，幾個牧人在找着牲口的食糧。在一片曠野，荒落的沙漠裏，幾個運貨商，像影子一樣踱着。牽着羣羣的駱駝，——那沙漠的王，背峰上疊着沉重的包袱，遲碩地搖　着頭，向着沙漠裏，一步步搖擺地走着。</p>
<p>蜿蜓的長城，起伏地伏在山頂上，彷彿深展到迷濛的雲霧裏，那崇高莊嚴的，八個高山嶺的像城堡樣高聳在天空裏，許多的山，像沙坵似的圍繞着，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>山上瀰漫延着細細的野草，被風吹得波動，風沙刮時，天空裏矇着一層的灰沙。</p>
<p>有一個旅客，跨過了城磚，劃着火柴，好容易躲避着風，劃了好幾根，纔用火點着漫生的野草，一絲絲輕烟飄着，微火蔓延着，輕烟慢慢地濃起來，那古時代的烽火似的，黑烟昇起來，慢慢地更蓬升起來，那黑烟像蛇的舌頭樣，向天空舐着。……</p>
<p>這使我永遠忘不掉的。當一想起莊嚴的八達嶺，那烽火就像出現在眼前———我希望着，那烽火永遠的煽燒着，那黑烟能衝捲上天，像在黑暗裏一把燃燒的火炬般，永遠照耀着大地上。</p>
<h3 id="c184">顯頓亞 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 雷石榆</p>
<p>「顯頓亞」是音譯，除可以把「亞」字譯爲「屋」（這　屋」字並不是房屋的意思，而是對一般較低下的商人的稱呼，譬如呌報販做新聞屋樣，呌洗衣人做洗濯屋樣，但也呌小孩子做坊屋……）字外，前兩字是頗難找到同意味的名稱代替牠的，因爲那是日本特別的固有名詞。我本想用「官傳廣吿的人」這幾個字，但中國是沒有用那種方式去宣傳廣吿，而且宣傳的方式也很多的。</p>
<p>，究竟是怎樣的傢伙呢？</p>
<p>我相信去到東京的人，至少在一個月內見過若干次這種奇景的，尤其是在繁盛的區域內。但我到了東京一年多才知道那名稱，假如不是　看小說從字典找出來，或者不問人或聽人講述出來，也許到現在還　明白。</p>
<p>那奇景是這樣的：一羣奇形怪狀的入（至少三名以上吧），那人羣裏有男的有女的，但若果不是從聲音去辨別視覺的認識，或會把男人看作女人，把女人看作男人。因爲他（她）們差不多都是穿着一樣的奇異服裝，臉上塗抹的脂粉也差不多比賣淫婦要潑厚若干倍，而且還用漆黑的什麽東西把眉畫得分外粗長的，甚至有的還在臉上的什麽地方塗幾筆，比方嘴巴上的鬍子。他（她）們的任務雖然一樣，但在合作上是分工的，譬如有的打鈸，有的吹管或喇叭，有的擊鼓，有的離開隊伍批給廣告。最重要的是前頭領隊的兩手揭着像一把羅傘似的那上面大書特寫着不是减價便是開張的廣告牌的人，他的步法似乎要費了多少工夫研究過的，恕我沒法子形容，但我的腦海依然殘留着這樣的印象：那兩個脚板跳踏得很速，但走得又很慢，而且是做着弧　踏走，他的步武的動作是合奏着那些鼓樂聲的，那廣告牌杆也合奏着他的步武的動作而或左移或右移，或略昇或略降。有一决我和小熊秀雄走在街上，正碰見那麽一隊，小熊非常讚嘆那人的步法，一面凝視着一面反復着說道：</p>
<p>『非常熟練，那是多麽好的步法啊！</p>
<p>我不以爲然地挿嘴道：</p>
<p>『那算什麽一回事，要是你玩那個的話，比他還好也說不定』。</p>
<p>『不，那是很難學的』！他正經地不勝戚佩似的說，同時再三回頭望望他。</p>
<p>後面的人們的各自的動作是不同的，但步法却很一致。</p>
<p>宣傳廣告的方式是很多的，而且一天一天進步，譬如有的用汽球，有的用飛機……，但日本這種「顯頓亞」依然存在，也許因還保持着一種招徠生意的魅力。（東京什碎）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government has ordered martial law to be declared in necessary areas (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to understand the current situation in Xi'an, the central authorities dispatched an aircraft on the 13th to conduct reconnaissance over Xi'an and its surrounding areas. According to reports, the situation inside Xi'an city is extremely chaotic, with signs of street fighting. The Northeast Army seems to be concentrating from Weinan towards Lintong. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central authorities held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 13th, with all committee members in Nanjing attending. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and He Yingqin and Zhang Qun gave reports one after another. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. It is said that during the meeting, some committee members advocated sending representatives from the central government to Xi'an, but no decision was made. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Prior to the Xi'an Incident, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek left Xi'an on the afternoon of the 11th to stay overnight at Huaqing Pool. On the morning of the 12th, Chiang was forced to relocate to Xi'an for temporary residence. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mr. Donald, a Westerner who is very close to both Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang, is now planning to find a way to fly to Xi'an to observe the real situation there. If possible, he also intends to restore Chiang's freedom. It is reported that Mr. Donald was in Hankou when he received news of the Xi'an Incident. He flew to Luoyang today. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, originally planned to travel to Luoyang by plane, but temporarily abandoned the plan. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's advisor, Donald, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th with Vice President Kong. He then flew to Luoyang with Huang Renlin to visit Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Shaanxi. Donald first sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang and received a reply from Zhang before his departure. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang in the morning, advising him to come to his senses. It is said that Zhang has replied to He. (13th Dispatch) After Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, the signboard of his office in Nanjing was removed on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that the office staff have disappeared without a trace. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Two artillery regiments of Zhang's troops are stationed in Luoyang, commanded by Brigade Commander Huang. It is said that when the incident occurred, Zhang telegraphed Huang to seize banks, guard armories, and airfields. Huang disobeyed the order and took the original telegram to Zhu Weizhou to report. Zhu then led troops to completely disarm the two regiments. The situation in Luoyang is currently safe. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, someone met with Feng Yuxiang and Li Liejun to inquire about everything. Both Feng and Li said that during this time, one should remain calm and did not want to express anything else. Security in Nanjing is being stepped up, and there are no concerns about public safety. Passenger trains on the Jinpu Railway continued to run as usual on the 13th, but freight trains were suspended. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An American, Donald, took a train to Luoyang this afternoon and will transfer to Xi'an. (13th Dispatch) Huang Renlin accompanied Donald to Luoyang on the 13th. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Donald flew to Xi'an on the 13th to urge Zhang to reflect. All sectors of Hangzhou have scheduled a citizens' assembly for the 14th to express their sincere support for the leader. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that red flags were hung in Xi'an this morning, but when government planes flew over the city, they were hurriedly removed. According to reliable news received in Nanjing, the Xi'an Incident began at 8:30 AM on Saturday. At that time, the sound of rifle fire could be heard everywhere in Xi'an. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had ordered a special train to be prepared the night before the incident, with the engine fired up and ready to depart, in preparation for leaving Xi'an after giving a speech to Zhang's military officers in the morning. Later, because the time for Chiang to board the train had passed but he still hadn't arrived at the station, the station staff were quite alarmed. Upon hearing gunfire and discovering that the tracks had been cut, they became even more worried. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People here today are expressing extreme shock regarding news of the Xi'an Incident. However, telegrams received in Beiping two days ago had already hinted that the situation there was not very stable. The cause of this incident is due to disagreements between Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang regarding the suppression of the Communist army. Chiang advocated resolute suppression. It is rumored that Chiang once told people that anyone who talks grandly about fighting Japan before the Communist bandits are eliminated is a traitor to the country. As for Zhang Xueliang's troops, news had been received here several months ago that they had a good impression of the Communist bandits and had not fought against them for at least nine months. It is reported that most of Zhang's troops are concentrated in the Tongguan area. A spokesman for the Hebei-Chahar authorities told reporters today that if the Xi'an Incident proves to be caused by a joint effort between Zhang Xueliang and the Communists, the Hebei and Chahar authorities will, of course, continue to uphold their anti-Communist policy and resist this rebellion. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) After Zhang Xueliang's rebellion, telegraphic communications between Shanxi and Shaanxi had not been restored as of 3:00 PM on the 13th. Although wireless telegraphic communications could be received, they were fragmented and incomplete. However, the general judgment is that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's safety is not at all in question. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Notification from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Domestic and Foreign Envoys and Consuls</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an, the central government has already clearly ordered that he be stripped of all his concurrent and substantive positions and handed over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict handling. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also notified our embassies and consulates abroad and the diplomatic envoys of various countries to our country of the incident on the 13th. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Local Dispatch) According to inquiries by the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency, the diplomatic personnel of various countries in Shanghai are paying close attention to Zhang Xueliang's rebellion. Although it was a holiday yesterday, the consulates of Britain, the United States, Japan, Russia, Italy, and Germany still maintained normal operations, collected information, and telegraphed their respective governments. The Italian Ambassador, Aloisi, usually stayed at his official residence on Haig Road to conduct official business. Yesterday morning, he personally visited the consulate office on Jing'an Temple Road to direct everything.</p>
<p>Rumors that Yu Xuezhong was Detained and Interrogated in Shaanxi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government's important personnel currently in Shaanxi include Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Jiang Zuobin, Jiang Dingwen, Jiang Bocheng, Mao Bangchu, Mao Bingwen, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, Chen Tiaoyuan, Qian Dajun, and Zhu Shaoliang. It is rumored that all of them have been detained. There are also rumors that Yu Xuezhong was detained in Shaanxi for opposing Zhang's views. Yu's representative in Nanjing returned to Shanghai from Gansu five days ago and rushed back from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th. According to him, Yu was still in Xi'an when he left Gansu. Whether or not he has been detained is being verified by telegram. As of the afternoon, no reply has been received. Most of Yu's troops, totaling three divisions, are from Shandong and are unlikely to undergo any other changes. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yan, Song, and Yu Telegraph to Nanjing, Resolving to Jointly Maintain the Overall Situation and Avoid Catastrophe</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Two-An Incident occurred, Yan Xishan, Song Zheyuan, and Yu Hanmou received telegrams from Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs that evening. All of them telegraphed to Nanjing on the 13th. The original texts are as follows: (1) Yan Xishan's telegram (Title omitted): "The Xi'an incident is highly unusual. We should all work together to maintain the overall situation." (Middle part omitted) "I have already instructed Juechen (Xu Yongchang's alias) to go to Nanjing to discuss everything." (2) Song Zheyuan's telegram (Title omitted): "The mutiny of the garrison troops in Xi'an and the encirclement of the Chairman have caused me deep shock upon hearing this news from afar. At this time of national crisis, such an extraordinary event has occurred, truly a great misfortune for the country. It is presumed that Zhang Xueliang has been surrounded by red elements, resulting in this great error. In addition to strengthening defenses, I also pray for detailed information." (3) Yu Hanmou's telegram (Title omitted): "The Shaanxi incident is a sudden surprise. The Chairman is the key to the nation's safety and well-being. I urgently hope that he will be rescued as soon as possible to stabilize the country and comfort the people. As for Zhang Hanqing's reckless disregard, there must be other backgrounds. The state of affairs is so dire, and my hidden worries are extreme. I wholeheartedly support the central government, maintain a calm attitude, and appease the local gentry and people. I hope to be informed at any time so that I know how to follow." (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Circular Telegram Lists Names of Persons Holding Erroneous Views</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important central official, because of the inconsistent reports circulating outside about the names listed in Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram, made an analysis of the persons listed in the original telegram and issued a statement saying: "Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram of the 12th not only contains erroneous content and engages in extreme distortion and slander, but the names listed in the telegram also clearly show evidence of coercion and fabrication. An examination of the names listed at the end of the telegram shows that, in addition to Zhang Xueliang, there are a total of eighteen people. For example, Yang Hucheng has recently been in regular contact with important central figures, and it is reported that Feng Qinzai and Sun Weiru are being monitored in Xi'an, which already shows one aspect of the situation. As for Chen Tiaoyuan, Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Jiang Dingwen, Wei Lihuang, Wan Yaohuang, Chen Jicheng, and Ma Zhanshan, all of whom are important military and political officers who were summoned to Shaanxi, they are also listed. Even Qian Dajun, the Director of the Chairman's Office, and Shao Lizi, the Chairman of Shaanxi Province, are included. This is something that no one can believe. Therefore, after studying all the names listed in the telegram, the question of whether He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Jing Weicheng, Dong Yingbin, and Yu Xuezhong, the remaining five people, acted out of their own free will is also highly questionable. In summary, the erroneous nature of the situation in Xi'an can be seen from this." (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters Requested Funds in Advance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources familiar with the financial situation, the funds for the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters were usually allocated twice a month, on the 10th and 25th. This month, the headquarters, citing the upcoming New Year, repeatedly requested that the entire month's funds be paid in one installment on the 10th. The authorities did not approve this. The fact that the Xi'an Incident happened on the 12th shows that the scheme seems to have been premeditated. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch) Military Leaders Temporarily Detained in Xi'an</p>

<p>(Tokyo) News of the rebellion in Xi'an arrived here late last night, and all parties expressed shock.

Although today is a Sunday holiday, the heads of the Ministry of the Navy convened a meeting this afternoon to discuss future attitudes. At the same time, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and War also convened separate meetings, expressing their keen attention and their desire to understand the true situation caused by the rebellion in Xi'an. General observations are that Japan's re-planning of its China policy depends entirely on the outcome of the current rebellion in Xi'an, but for the time being, a wait-and-see attitude is being maintained. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese officials were quite shocked after receiving news of the Xi'an Incident and spent the day holding meetings to discuss the situation, appearing very busy. Mr. Kuwashima, Director of the East Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was traveling on a certain island but immediately returned to Tokyo after receiving news of the incident and met with Foreign Minister Arita for two hours.

"The Messenger" reported that Zhang Xueliang had been seeking cooperation with Moscow for several months.

<h3 id="e3">Feng Yuxiang Telegraphs Zhang Xueliang Yesterday, Saying That in the Face of Deepening Foreign Aggression, There Should be No Room for Internal Discord; Please Release Generalissimo Chiang First, and Opinions Can Be Openly Stated <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Feng Yuxiang, telegraphed to Zhang Xueliang on the 13th, saying: "My dear Brother Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, upon reading your circular telegram, I was shocked to learn that Generalissimo Chiang is being temporarily detained in Xi'an. Generalissimo Chiang's efforts to strengthen the country are known to all. Political and military affairs have been gradually improving. The major achievements, such as the true unification of national affairs, the true unwavering stance in diplomacy, and the resistance against the enemy by central troops in the war in Suiyuan, are all obvious to everyone. At this time of deepening foreign aggression and precarious situation, even if we work together to overcome national difficulties, we still worry that our plans may be insufficient. How can we allow internal discord to shake the foundation of the country? For your sake, brother, I offer my humble opinions as follows: (1) Please release Generalissimo Chiang and return him to Nanjing. If you, brother, have difficulties with stationing troops in Shaanxi and Gansu, or if you have any opinions, you can openly state them. Generalissimo Chiang is a revolutionary soldier, upright and forthright, and will surely be inclusive and adopt your suggestions. Then the difficulties in your area will be resolved, and the ambition to resist Japan will be realized. (2) If you worry that things have gone too far and cannot be reversed, or that there may be some repercussions that are unfavorable to you, brother, then I, Feng, can provide a complete guarantee. If you still cannot feel at ease, I will send many of my trusted friends to stay in your area as a guarantee for the release and return of Generalissimo Chiang. (3) In dealing with affairs, it is important to have a clear and consistent view. Do not let others sow discord and damage feelings or harm the foundation of the country. I am older and have more experience. An old horse knows the way, and I will certainly not mislead you. (4) In short, if misunderstandings can be resolved and we can discuss national affairs with Generalissimo Chiang, then all difficult points can be resolved easily, benefiting both the country and individuals. As for the matter of a formal disciplinary action, as long as you, brother, can release and return Chiang, then our friends in the central government will be able to find a way to reverse the situation. You are enlightened, brother, and should be able to understand this. I offer this sincere advice and hope you will carefully consider it and provide a reply." Feng Yuxiang, Yuan.

<h3 id="e4">Kong Xiangxi Issues a Statement: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Safety is Not a Problem; Governmental Affairs of All Departments Proceed as Usual and Will Not Be Affected; Deeply Hopes that the People Will Maintain Calm and Trust the Government <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter, hearing that Vice President Kong had come to Nanjing despite his illness, paid him a special visit. He was kind enough to issue the following statement: "I received news of the Xi'an Incident on the 12th, which shocked me deeply. I came to Nanjing that very night despite my illness. As the central government decided that I should be responsible for the affairs of the Executive Yuan, I convened a temporary meeting this morning and attended the temporary meetings of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee this afternoon. The ways to handle the Shaanxi Incident were all discussed. At the same time, I received many telegrams from various generals and local authorities, most of which expressed extreme indignation at the Shaanxi Incident and reported local peace, expressing their sincere support for the central government. This shows that the hearts of the people across the country are united and loyal to the country, which is deeply gratifying. As for the cause of the Shaanxi Incident, it is probably that a small number of generals stationed in Xi'an do not fully understand the central government's policies and have been incited by unscrupulous elements, acting on temporary emotions and recklessly detaining the commander-in-chief, which will have a profound and significant impact on the country's future. As for the safety of Generalissimo Chiang himself, in addition to the public telegram, Zhang Xueliang also sent me a private telegram, which briefly stated: 'I have loved and protected Generalissimo Chiang for eight years, and I will be responsible for protecting his safety and will not allow him to suffer any harm. My brother has treated me with great kindness, and I hope he will understand that I have no other intentions.' He also sent a telegram to Madam Chiang, with a similar message, and said, 'I have never let anyone down in my life. My heart is clear, and I can swear to heaven. Please rest assured, Madam.' This shows that he is responsible for protecting Generalissimo Chiang and there is no question about it. Our government's economic government has made efforts over the years, and the laws and regulations have become complete. The government organization is also sound. Any policy is subject to close discussion by the central government before it is implemented and is never changed according to individual intentions. The minority cannot overturn the majority. Zhang Xueliang has always expressed respect for Generalissimo Chiang, and Generalissimo Chiang has also placed great trust in him. If he had any opinions, he could have sincerely discussed them. But as a member of the Central Committee, he should have followed legal procedures and fully stated his views to the Central Committee. If they were beneficial to the country, there would have been no harm in discussing them at length. I will abide by the central government's decision and, during the period when Generalissimo Chiang is temporarily unable to exercise his powers, be responsible for presiding over the affairs of the Executive Yuan. I will adhere to the central government's established policies and, under the guidance of the entire central organization, work hard to move forward. The government affairs of all departments will continue to proceed as usual, and the government's affairs will not be affected by temporary events or individual advances and retreats. The responsible officials in various localities, who have assisted the central government and worked hard, will certainly be able to uphold the central government's objectives, safeguard security, and maintain local order at this time of crisis. I hope that the people across the country will remain calm, trust the government, and not be incited by rumors. I firmly believe that the Shaanxi Incident will be resolved satisfactorily in the shortest possible time." (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Vice President Kong's Circular Telegram: Willing to Work Together with the People of the Country; All Government Affairs Proceed as Usual <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, issued a circular telegram to all provinces and cities on the 13th, stating: "Xiangxi is holding a high position in the central government, serving in the Executive Yuan. A month ago, I was undergoing treatment for illness in Shanghai. The doctor originally ordered me to rest quietly. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred. The central government, because Generalissimo Chiang is temporarily unable to exercise his powers, decided to entrust me with the affairs of the Executive Yuan. Therefore, I rushed to Nanjing overnight despite my illness. I have read the circular telegram of a few generals in Xi'an, which shows that they have misunderstandings about the intentions of the central government. The central government colleagues have always been determined to resist the enemy and defend against insults. I firmly believe that at this time of both internal and external troubles, the strategy for saving the country must be to strive for the integrity of sovereignty and territory. In order to achieve this goal, we must first complete domestic unification and concentrate our strength in order to consolidate the country's position. Generalissimo Chiang is sincerely serving the country and is in charge of the central government. He has been upholding this position, working hard, and striving to move forward, and the results are obvious. Unexpectedly, on the front line of pacifying the border, the fierce battle is still ongoing, but in the rear in Xi'an, a sudden incident has occurred. At this time when the country's survival is at stake, there is actually such a dispute, which has a profound and significant impact on the future of our country. I firmly believe that the people of the country have always understood the greater picture and have a long-standing love for the country. They will be able to consistently support the central government's established national policy and complete the country's unification. Officials at all levels in various localities, who have assisted the central government and whose loyalty has been well-established, will certainly be able to further encourage loyalty and bravery, carry out the central government's intentions, and work in a consistent manner. Xiangxi and my colleagues in the Executive Yuan will, at this time of crisis, shoulder the heavy responsibility, promote difficult tasks, and proceed with all government affairs as usual. We will follow Generalissimo Chiang's established policies and, with the greatest effort, work together with the people of the country to ensure the country's security. This is what Xiangxi and others swear to do and hope that all officials and people of the country will work together to achieve. I hereby send this telegram to report to you." Kong Xiangxi, Yuan.

The Central Government has been inclusive, hoping to receive a positive effect, but the wolf is by nature greedy and unrepentant. At the time of national unification and when the suppression of chaos is about to be completed, he actually harbored evil intentions, kidnapped the commander, shook the foundation of the country, and formed a conspiracy. He even embellished heresies and bewitched the youth. Judging from his intentions and comparing his past deeds, if this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?

This is truly something that both gods and men are indignant about. Fortunately, our Central Government has decisively made a decision and resolved on four measures, and the National Government has issued an order to strip him of all his positions and hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for strict handling. This is enough to strip him of his evil spirit and strengthen the strength of the entire country.

There is no way to seek survival without unity, and there is no way to talk about saving the country without domestic stability. In recent months, the prototype of unification has just been formed, and the construction of national defense is in full swing. It is fortunate that the foundation for resisting foreign insults and seeking survival has been laid, and the great cause of revival can be achieved like the rising sun. However, there is a sudden action in Xi'an to coerce the commander and destroy unification, not hesitating to disrupt the front line and undermine discipline, causing the hearts of the entire country to be shaken and making the great plan of saving the country and seeking survival more difficult. Upon hearing this, we are extremely saddened. Fortunately, the Central Government has decided to consolidate the central hub and guarantee unification. Jiangsu Province should do its utmost to fulfill its responsibilities, unify its will, and stabilize the region to protect the survival of the nation. At this critical moment of safety and danger, right and wrong must be clear, and the direction must be determined.

<p>— Proper</p>
<p>This extraordinary incident in Xi'an is a matter of life and death for our country. If it is not handled properly, it could plunge the country back into a state of disintegration, giving the enemy an excellent opportunity to intensify their aggression. Therefore, even at this time, the central and local military and political authorities should use prudent but resolute means to deal with this unprecedentedly difficult situation. The people of the whole country should also unite their will for the sake of the country and the nation and provide the government with strong and powerful support.</p>
<p>In the current situation, the most concerning point is that the war in eastern Suiyuan is in progress, and such an unfortunate disturbance has occurred in the rear. This will affect the morale of the soldiers at the front, making Suiyuan, the center of national defense, even more difficult to defend. Regarding this point, we hope that the national army at the front line in Suiyuan will continue to make the greatest efforts to defend the territory and not waver in its determination to resist the enemy because of this incident.</p>
<p>The most concerning thing is the safety and freedom of Chairman Chiang and important Central Army generals Chen Cheng, Chiang Dingwen, and others who were detained by the rebel army in Xi'an. Chairman Chiang is the supreme military leader of our country, and his prestige has always been the only center of gravity for the national military and government. Now that he and several of his most loyal important generals have lost their freedom, this poses a danger of causing a unified China to once again trend toward disintegration. The central joint meeting last night decided to add to the number of standing committee members of the Military Affairs Commission. These newly announced standing committee members are all generals who made the most contributions during the Northern Expedition. Their prestige is fully sufficient to guide the troops of all provinces throughout the country outside of Xi'an. During this most serious emergency period, the public security of the entire country must be maintained. The expressions of the military and political leaders of Jin, Lu, Yue, and Xiang provinces yesterday regarding the Xi'an Incident can prove this point. However, to truly unify the morale of the entire country, it is ultimately necessary to first restore the freedom of Chairman Chiang and his detained subordinates. We hope that even under extremely difficult circumstances, the Central Government can still retain avenues of contact with Zhang Xueliang's side to rescue Chairman Chiang and others.</p>
<p>Thirdly, how Zhang Xueliang should be punished for violating national discipline and betraying the Central Government is also a matter of concern. Such a rebel should of course be suppressed by the Central Government. However, once the war begins, the safety of Chairman Chiang and others will become a problem. Under such a contradictory situation, the Central Government resolutely issued an order to strip Zhang Xueliang of his duties and investigate him. This can uphold discipline internally and show the strength of the Central Government externally. This is indeed a necessary and appropriate measure. The number of rebels is only over 100,000. Under the pressure of the Central Army, which far exceeds this number, it can be resolved sooner or later. However, to avoid the bloodshed that pleases the enemy and pains those close to us, we still hope that Zhang Xueliang or his subordinates will have a final awakening and automatically and unconditionally restore the freedom of Chairman Chiang and others as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The above three points are what we should be aware of clearly at present. Although Chairman Chiang has temporarily left the leadership position, the Three Principles of the People proclaimed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen are still guiding us. This political proposition, which is most suitable for the current stage of the revolution, can connect the hearts of the people who love the country and the nation and form an incomparably strong unity. We must declare to the world that China is still a whole, unified China and a China that cannot be easily insulted.</p>

<p>(Buenos Aires) The Pan-American Peace Convention was signed today by representatives of the twenty-one countries participating in the Pan-American Peace Conference and will be submitted to the parliaments of their respective countries for approval. US Chief Representative and Secretary of State Hull yesterday expressed his opinion that the implementation of this convention would be the most reliable guarantee for peace in the Americas. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Buenos Aires) Representatives of various countries at the Pan-American Peace Conference recently signed the Pan-American Peace Organization Convention, divided into two articles, and a protocol:</p>
<p>Article 1: When peace in the Americas is threatened, the signatory countries to the Paris Pact (signed in August 1928) or the Pan-American Conciliation and Non-Aggression Pact (signed in October 1933) should consult with other governments in the Americas on peaceful cooperation plans.</p>
<p>Article 2: If war breaks out between countries in the Americas, other governments in the Americas should immediately consult each other to determine the obligations stipulated in the Paris Pact and the Pan-American Conciliation and Non-Aggression Pact, and to discuss methods of peaceful cooperation. When war occurs in countries outside the Americas and the American continent is threatened as a result, the scope of the above-mentioned mutual consultation methods should be increased.</p>
<p>The protocol states: "No country shall interfere in the internal or foreign affairs of other countries, whether directly or indirectly. If this provision is violated by one of the signatory countries, the other signatory countries shall immediately consult each other in order to find a peaceful solution. Furthermore, if disputes arise among the signatory countries regarding the interpretation of this convention and this protocol, they should be resolved through conciliation and arbitration procedures."

<p>Barcelona - Due to mutual jealousy among the cabinet members of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (affiliated with the Third International) and the Marxist Unified Workers' Party (affiliated with the Trotskyist faction, i.e., the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party), cracks have appeared within the Catalan Autonomous Government. The cabinet members belonging to the Unified Socialist Party are the Minister of Public Works, Comillera, and the Minister of Labor, Valde. The only cabinet member belonging to the Marxist Unified Workers' Party is the Minister of Justice, Venien. An irreconcilable situation has developed between the two sides. Recently, the Unified Labor Party has been wantonly attacking the Soviet authorities, which has made the Unified Socialist Party even more dissatisfied. However, the National Confederation of Labor, an anarchist organization, has issued an official statement to mediate, stating that all forces opposing the Fascists should not be excluded from the Autonomous Government.

<p>Proclamation to All Citizens</p>
<p>(London) Sir Wollaston, Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, read the proclamation of the accession of the new King George VI from the balcony of St. James's Palace this afternoon. The ceremony was solemn and followed tradition. The crowd in front of the palace was immense, listening intently. The new monarch, along with Queen Mary and other members of the royal family, appeared on the balcony of nearby Marlborough House. The people cheered and paid their respects upon seeing them. Afterwards, Sir Wollaston went to three other locations, including Trafalgar Square, to read the proclamation. The weather today was cold and drizzly, quite different from the clear weather when the abdicated King ascended the throne in January of this year. The enthusiasm was also less than that of the 25th anniversary of the coronation of the late King George V in June of last year, but the people's sincere loyalty to the new monarch was the same. This could be seen in the collective cry of "God save the King" by the entire audience after the proclamation was read. The new King's proclamation reads as follows:</p>
<p>"In accordance with the King's Abdication Act of December 10, His Majesty King Edward VIII has declared that he and his descendants renounce the throne with firm and irrevocable intention. Therefore, the Abdication Act has now taken effect. The throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the overseas dominions belonging to His Majesty the former King, shall, in accordance with the only rightful path, be taken by His Royal Highness Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George. We, the leaders of the church and state, together with the prominent ministers of His Majesty the former King's Privy Council, the Lord Mayor of London, and the gentry and citizens, hereby proclaim, with one heart and one voice, in the presence of all, that His Royal Highness Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, by the grace of God, is established as the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the overseas dominions, Emperor of India, and Defender of the Faith. We solemnly pledge our enduring loyalty and affection, and earnestly pray to God to protect the King and Queen in governing our country. May God bless George VI and grant him health, happiness, and a long life to reign over us. Issued at St. James's Palace on December 20, 1936. God save the King." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Address to the Army, Navy, and Air Force</p>
<p>(London) In accordance with the constitution, the British King, after ascending the throne, also assumes the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The address to the Navy mentions that he and his father, the late Emperor, had received naval training in their early years and that he had witnessed the great achievements of the soldiers in maintaining the traditions of the British Navy during the greatest naval battle of the new era at Jutland. He said that he intended to maintain the closest possible contact with all officers and soldiers of the entire Navy of the Empire. The address to the Army assured the soldiers that he would prioritize their well-being and mentioned that he had been appointed a Major General in the Army four years ago. After associating with the Army, he was even more impressed by their bravery, seriousness, and dedication to their difficult duties. He concluded by saying that the task before him was very arduous, but he knew that all officers and soldiers of the entire Army of the Empire would express their loyalty to lighten his heavy burden. The address to the Air Force stated that he had served as a junior officer in the Air Force in 1918, after serving in the Independent Air Force in France, and that he had always regarded this as a happy part of his life. In the future, he would maintain a close relationship with the Air Force. As an Air Marshal, he was pleased to see that after the rapid expansion of the Air Force, its responsibilities were no less than those of the Army. He hoped that the Air Force of the Empire would maintain its achievements. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Regarding the proposal by the British and French governments to mediate the Spanish civil war, the German government submitted its reply today. This reply can be published on Monday morning. It is heard that its contents advocate the strict implementation of the non-intervention policy and include the prohibition of volunteers from enlisting and the prohibition of fundraising to aid both sides of the civil war within the non-intervention policy. As for the British and French proposal to mediate the civil war, the German reply did not agree with it. According to political figures, this kind of mediation method should not be proposed unless it is absolutely certain that it will succeed. Moreover, a plebiscite must be held after General Franco, the leader of the National Army government, has control of the entire country. If a plebiscite is held in the current situation, it will only increase the bloodshed. Political figures also said that Germany's recognition of the National Army government is intended to curb the continued development of Bolshevik forces in Spain. Observers generally predict that Germany may ask the British and French governments whether they wish to guarantee Spain's independence before proceeding with mediation. It is heard that the Italian reply is roughly the same in wording. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(2) Suggesting to the member states of the League of Nations attending the Non-Intervention Method Adjustment Committee to make the greatest efforts to quickly implement an effective monitoring system.</p>
<p>(3) Expressing sympathy for the British and French governments' proposal to mediate the Spanish civil war.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the resolution suggests that countries cooperate to humanize the Spanish civil war and acknowledges that, in the future, after the end of the civil war, countries have a special need to assist Spain's domestic construction. The Council has authorized League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to direct the League of Nations technical agencies to provide assistance when such assistance is necessary. When the resolution was submitted for debate, Spanish Foreign Minister Del Valle declared that he could accept the section of the resolution on the humanization of the Spanish civil war, but this kind of action should be initiated by the Spanish government and accepted by the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e43">Tokyo Correspondence: A Caricature of Japan's Military Industry Capital at the Present Stage (Part 2) <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>Let's take another look at the most important types of goods imported into Japan, listing the eight most vital:</p>
<p>Wheat, beans, crude and heavy oil, cotton, wool, iron, machinery, timber.</p>
<p>Roughly eighty to ninety percent of imports are raw materials, with a small portion being semi-finished products. While wheat is imported, wheat flour is exported. Large quantities of cotton and wool are imported, and correspondingly large quantities of cotton cloth and woolen fabrics are exported. Only iron, and crude and heavy oil, are used to develop Japan's military industries.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much is imported, it always feels insufficient. The arms race will not stop until capitalism is destroyed, and all countries are the same. But the shortage of raw materials worries these ambitious individuals.</p>
<p>The United States is a major mineral-producing country, but due to shortages and competition, mineral prices are also rising there. This is a cause of great hardship for Japan, which desperately needs to import minerals. Let's examine this further from the perspective of rising prices:</p>
<p>Needless to say, iron is fundamental to the existence of all industries. In 1935, Japan's iron production reached 3.5 million tons, which could be said to barely meet domestic needs. However, it was still necessary to import iron ore, as Japan's domestic ore production was very small. Although there were mines, the amount extracted was also meager. Without the import of ore, iron could not be produced. Therefore, imports in 1935 reached 3.3 million tons. Even pig iron and scrap iron, used as raw materials for steel, had to be imported in large quantities. In 1935, pig iron imports reached one million tons and scrap iron 1.7 million tons. Compared to 1934, pig iron imports increased by 60 percent, and scrap iron by 20 percent. While imports increased, iron prices also soared. During Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, the price of iron for general use was 47.5 yuan per ton, and for steelmaking, it was 46.5 yuan. But recently (October -), the prices of both types of iron mentioned above have risen to 49 yuan. An increase of more than two yuan per ton, which, based on a demand of 3 million tons, would result in an additional cost of more than 6 million yuan. This can also be said to be one of the fundamental reasons for the increased burden (increased taxes) on the Japanese public today.</p>
<p>Most of the scrap iron is imported from the United States, but as the demand in the United States is also increasing, and because this is a raw material for the military industry, the "Export Prohibition Act" may be passed under certain circumstances – this further forces prices up. Currently, in Japan, one ton of high-quality iron is worth 60 yuan, an increase of nearly 20 yuan compared to last autumn.</p>
<p>It can be seen that "national iron production" and "trade control" are necessary cries. The fate of the Longyan Iron Mine in North China is being revived primarily under the current state of iron shortage.</p>
<p>Next is electrical copper, which is also very important. Before the European War, Japan's electrical copper was not only sufficient but also exported. However, due to competition with the United States and rapidly expanding needs, it has now become an importer of electrical copper. In the table above, we see that copper imports are also increasing year by year. In 1933, copper imports amounted to 9.6 million yuan. In 1934, it increased to 28.4 million yuan, a threefold increase. In 1935, it increased further, with imports totaling 37.9 million yuan. Because countries are all engaged in intense preparations for war, the need for copper has increased even more. Copper is soft and essential for metal alloys, and copper is the primary component of electrical wires.</p>
<p>Next is tin. Tin is very useful for plating iron sheets with gold and for metal alloys. World production is not very large, but demand is increasing, so market prices are also soaring.</p>
<p>Next are lead and zinc. Lead can be used to make lead pipes and lead chambers for manufacturing sulfuric acid without further refinement. As an alloy, it can be used to create storage batteries and printing type. It can also be used as a compound in pigments. It has a wide range of uses. But Japan must also import it. In 1933, 12 million yuan worth of lead was imported. In 1934, 17.9 million yuan was imported, and in 1935, it was 20.5 million yuan, also increasing year by year, but the rate of increase is not as large as that of iron and copper.</p>
<p>Zinc is used for plating iron sheets and in other chemical industrial products. Japan also has a considerable amount of domestic production, but it still inevitably imports zinc ore every year. However, this type of import is not large, averaging just over one million yuan per year. Market prices are, of course, also rising. The main lead-producing countries are the United States, Mexico, and Canada, but they are far from Japan, so it is best to purchase more to prepare for emergencies. This August, when lead prices were low, 100 kilograms were worth 36.6 yuan, but now it has risen to 39.8 yuan. Zinc has also risen from 35 yuan to 39 yuan.</p>
<p>The soaring prices of general military raw materials fully illustrate the preparations for war. And Japan is a first-class active participant.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, since the world economic crisis that originated in 1930, the world production index has not yet reached the level of 1929. Even the so-called "economic recovery" is only a "lame economic recovery." There is no doubt that world capitalism is suffering from a general chronic paralysis. But it is also a fact that Japan is a relatively prosperous country. Because Japan's national fortune, as the Japanese military says, "has progressed," and has progressed to the point where the current political institutions cannot adapt. In fact, Japan's foreign trade this year has declined compared to last year. The so-called economic recovery is actually an artificial economic recovery driven by the expansion of the military industry!</p>
<p>But when it comes to the raw materials needed by the military industry, which must be imported in large quantities, a deep worry appears on the face of this prosperity. Seeking to satisfy needs through military action is an important characteristic of the development history of Japanese capitalism. It's not something that only exists today, but minerals cannot be obtained or extracted in a short period of time. Therefore, the faces of Japanese military industrial capitalists are half ecstatic and half worried.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Reasons for the Decline in Grain Prices in Zhangzhou and Xiamen: Suspension of Purchases in Taiwan and Shantou <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In the various districts of Southern Fujian, due to the large-scale export of Zhangzhou rice, grain prices have soared. The Zhangzhou authorities, starting from the 9th of this month, have specifically prohibited the export of rice. If the districts of Quanzhou and Xiamen need it, with proper certification confirming that it is for local consumers, it can still be transported. Although Zhangzhou is a rice-producing area, it is only sufficient to supply Quanzhou and Xiamen in addition to its own needs. After this order was implemented, Xiamen rice merchants took the opportunity to manipulate prices. On the 9th, the price of rice per dan (100 market catties) suddenly increased by 5 jiao, which was 1 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen higher per dan compared to ten days ago. This caused widespread panic. Fortunately, from the 10th to the 12th, 6,834 packages of Zhangzhou rice were successively transported to Xiamen (each package weighing 135 catties). At the same time, rice merchants transported 3,000 packages from Shanghai, with 1,200 packages arriving on the 11th and 12th. The price of rice consequently fell back, from 8 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen per dan to 7 yuan 7 jiao, a decrease of 7 jiao 7 fen compared to three days ago. People's minds were somewhat settled. The reason for the soaring grain prices in Southern Fujian was indeed large-scale exports. There were two destinations: Shantou and Taiwan. The recent purchase of Zhangzhou rice by Taiwan, the first batch successively transported there, was worth over 100,000 yuan, amounting to over 15,000 shi. The second batch purchased was worth over 80,000 yuan, amounting to 12,000 shi. It is said that some of the first batch transported to Taiwan was new rice from the late rice harvest. Due to the rush to transport it, many of the grains were not fully dried and became moldy upon arrival in Taiwan. As a result, Taiwan issued a stop purchase order three days ago to Zhangzhou, halting the transportation of the second batch of rice worth 80,000 yuan. This rice prepared for transport to Taiwan then had no outlet. At the same time, Shantou, having received assistance from Guangzhou, with Xiang rice transported via the Guangdong-Zhangzhou road, saw rice prices plummet. Not only could Zhangzhou rice not profit from being transported to Shantou, but based on Xiamen's high prices three days ago, it was potentially possible to transport rice from Shantou to Xiamen. Thus, the route to Shantou was also blocked. With Zhangzhou rice having lost its two major outlets, it was able to transport over 6,800 packages to Xiamen in three days (the price of Zhangzhou grain has also fallen by 3 to 4 jiao per dan in the past two days). This is the reason for the decline in grain prices. If there is no continued manipulation by rice merchants, it is hoped that the original price can be restored soon (December 13th).</p>
<h3 id="e45">Nanjing Municipal Government Regulates Food Supply: Rice Prices Can Be Stabilized Immediately – Remarks by Mayor Ma <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The Rice Market Management Office, which has been planned for a long time, has had its organizational regulations and grain industry management plans announced. Yesterday, the municipal government formally appointed Zheng Sangshe, the original director of the Rice Market Preparatory Office, as the director. According to the organization, there is supposed to be one more director, but the municipal government, emphasizing practical effectiveness at the initial stage, will prioritize thrift in staffing, so no one has been selected yet. The Management Office is approved to be formally established at the beginning of next week, so that it can engage in the city's grain management in order to balance and regulate the market. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mayor Ma to inquire about his hopes for grain management, methods for smoothly transporting Wuhu rice and grain to Nanjing, and the development of the city's railway expansion and sewer construction projects. Here is a record of Mayor Ma's remarks:</p>
<p>Manage the Rice Market, Stabilize the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Mayor Ma first said that regarding the establishment of the Rice Market Management Office, although it has been in preparation for quite some time, it is still necessary to emphasize practical work in the future, so that the citizens do not suffer from the pain of soaring food prices. The candidate for director has just been appointed. In the future, matters such as the establishment of warehouses, the investigation of production and sales, the evaluation of prices, and the regulation of grain will be quite complicated, so they should be carefully studied and properly implemented. Mayor Ma's hopes for the Rice Market Management Office are that regulating the people's food supply is a heavy responsibility, and he hopes that all sectors will assist in the process, so that the municipal government and the citizens can work together to establish a solid foundation for the food supply of the people of Nanjing.</p>
<p>Wuhu Rice Transport to Nanjing Can Now Be Smooth</p>
<p>The reporter then asked that since the source of rice and grain from Wuhu to Nanjing has not been smooth, rice prices have risen from time to time. Has the municipal government discussed appropriate measures with Wuhu? Mayor Ma said that Nanjing is not a rice-producing area and has always relied on supplies from other ports. Since the source of rice from Wuhu has decreased, the municipal government has immediately paid attention to this. It has now consulted with Anhui Province and obtained a solution. In the future, when Nanjing purchases rice from Wuhu, the municipal government will issue a sales permit to transport the rice. In this way, the source of rice from Wuhu can be smooth, and the quantity of rice needed in Nanjing can also be statistically determined. The rice price in Nanjing can then be stabilized.</p>
<p>Passenger Trains between Nanjing and Shanghai Will Prepare for Joint Operation</p>
<p>Regarding the city's railway, since its expansion, business has gradually developed. The Ministry of Railways has also responded to the municipal government with a letter expressing its strong approval of the principle of making full use of the city's railway. The city railway is now actively planning to replace sleepers and repair bridge signs, preparing to allow passenger trains between Nanjing and Shanghai to enter the city, so as to benefit the citizens. Mayor Ma said that the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and the city railway are already connected at Xiaguan in fact. However, the preparations for these passenger trains to enter the city are currently being made to purchase additional vehicles, as the original city railway vehicles are insufficient for scheduling. The stations on Zhongzheng Street in Xiaguan also need to be improved. Therefore, its realization will still require several months of facilities.</p>
<p>Sewer Project Funding Has Been Borrowed</p>
<p>The city's sewer project, from Zhuqiao to Dongguantou, has already begun construction. However, the city's sewer project is extremely arduous, among which the laying of intercepting sewers along both banks of the Qinhuai River is the basic project for the entire city's sewer system and the fundamental method for managing the Qinhuai River. Mayor Ma said that the sewer project from Dongguantou to Shuiximen has been decided to begin construction in January of the 26th year. The total cost of the water project is estimated to be over six million, and about two million is needed in this phase, which the city government has already borrowed and finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e46">"Roundtable Discussions in Beiping" <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>The term "roundtable discussion" originated in Japan. Its original purpose is to exchange opinions with each other on a particular issue. Formally, it is more free than a formal conference, and in terms of attitude, it is slightly more serious than a purely private exchange of opinions. Its nature seems similar to the Fabian Society in England and the Saloon in France. However, it is only "similar," and there is nothing more similar than this. In fact, fundamentally, these three each have their own characteristics and are vastly different. For example, the Fabian Society has a strong political party flavor, the saloon has a certain club color, and the roundtable discussion, while accepting the Western-transmitted meeting format, contains a considerable amount of the Eastern style of "waving a duster and engaging in pure conversation" or "gesticulating and talking about world affairs." In short, although all three are lateral expressions of public opinion, their characteristics are inherently British, French, and Eastern.</p>
<p>The existence of roundtable discussions in Beiping dates back several years. However, at that time, roundtable discussions were quite discriminated against by the local authorities, who even regarded them as peripheral organizations of certain action groups. As a result, they were successively ordered to disband by the authorities in various schools. Those organized by social figures were also successively prohibited from holding meetings by the local authorities. Although a few strong-willed people struggled repeatedly and barely managed to hold meetings, they ultimately could not avoid disbanding. The organizers were even arrested. Although most of these arrested organizers were released not long after, they had made promises to the authorities that they would no longer host such roundtable discussions and would no longer be active. Therefore, until November of last year, there were almost no roundtable discussions in this area. The above is the first phase of roundtable discussions here. At that time, the meaning of roundtable discussions contained a certain amount of political elements. The arguments made regarding the promotion of the current society's economic, political, and legal sectors, as well as the review of the international situation, were mostly radical. There was more negative criticism than positive suggestions, and more destructive meaning than constructive meaning. But at the time, the fashion was like this, otherwise it would be misunderstood by everyone. Therefore, from an external perspective, it seemed to contain a certain so-called effect, but after a thorough investigation, most of the participants were simply following the fashion of the time.</p>
<p>Around November of last year, the situation in North China was under further pressure from the Japanese, and the fate of falling into enemy hands was imminent. Traitors and petty villains gathered in the Tianjin and Beiping areas, and Doihara even took up residence in the Fuso Inn (a hotel opened by the Japanese) on Dongdan North Street here. Every day, he would go to the local authorities to urge them to make a decision, claiming that if the plan was not realized, he would never leave Beiping according to the oath he made when he came. A group of frustrated politicians, deposed warlords, and citizens hoping to live in peace followed suit and colluded with the traitors and petty villains to organize groups and openly exchange arguments about willingly surrendering the country. For a time, the situation was very noisy. At that time, anyone with a sense of integrity was heartbroken and tried to express themselves in order to counter these arguments that seemed to be hoping to live in peace but were actually surrendering the country. However, under the circumstances at the time, the former certainly had an overwhelming force against the latter. When the joint declaration of the presidents of various universities and prominent figures in the educational community was first published, it only slightly aroused movement and sympathy on the part of Westerners residing here. In terms of creating a tendency of public opinion, the strength was actually lacking. Therefore, these leaders of the cultural community felt the need to exchange opinions and concentrate arguments with each other. As a result, there were two types of organizations among them, so-called clubs and reunions. In name they were clubs and reunions, but in reality, when everyone gathered, in addition to exchanging opinions on the current situation in order to convey them to the people of the country, petition the authorities, and express themselves to the international community, they only occasionally prepared refreshments or slightly indulged in cigars and cigarettes. Although this did not have the name of a roundtable discussion, it was no different from a roundtable discussion. In addition, there were similar organizations among the teachers and students of various schools, and among the students themselves. But their names were either class meetings, department meetings, or student associations. In fact, all that was discussed was also mostly opinions on the current situation. Sometimes refreshments were prepared, but only to ease the external atmosphere. The reason for not using the name of roundtable discussion was to avoid external associations with the so-called roundtable discussions of the past, and to avoid suspicion. Therefore, the roundtable discussion in this period can be called the second period, which is also the embryonic stage of the roundtable discussion. It had a very great influence on the student demonstrations of the "December 9th" and "December 16th" resolutions.</p>
<p>Last December, the student movement broke out, and for a time the patriotic atmosphere was extremely strong. The arguments of surrender under the guise of maintaining peace were silenced. A group of young students were once again excited by passion, and their actions and deeds often exceeded not only the expectations of the older, more prestigious figures in the academic world, but sometimes even surpassed their own thoughts and beliefs. Because at that time, under the勢 of patriotic fervor, it was impossible to restrain oneself, which was the natural order of things and not at all strange. However, differences inevitably arose in their opinions, and it was almost impossible to exchange them or discuss them. Each person went his own way in what he believed. At the extreme, there was even a tendency to belittle empty talk and emphasize action. Therefore, from last December to January, February, March, etc. of this year, although the student movement was a sensation for a while, continuing one after another, every time a meeting called a roundtable discussion was held, it either ended without results due to mutual shouting and arguing, or one side, which obviously had the advantage, overwhelmed the other, causing them to remain silent. In the terminology popular at that time, this was called giving the other side a blow. Roundtable discussions that lived up to their name only occasionally took place among a few private individuals with similar opinions, and could no longer widely attract the public. This was the stage of formation of the second period of roundtable discussions, because it already had a formal name for roundtable discussions. However, it was also a period of decline, because it had become a mere appendage to action and was no longer of great importance. As for the roundtable discussions in which different opinions could be exchanged without any barriers and gradually create a lateral tendency of public opinion, they no longer existed at this time.</p>
<p>The third stage of the second period of roundtable discussions began after April of this year. At this time, the student movement was strictly prohibited by the authorities, and most of the particularly enthusiastic people were arrested and imprisoned, reaching several hundred people in total. Although they were subsequently released one after another, most of them no longer engaged in the movement. This was one aspect of the situation. Furthermore, at that time, the Japanese were in the process of adjusting the steps of their internal factions. There was the "February 26th" coup and the reorganization of the cabinet internally, and externally there were major changes in the officials stationed in China. There was no time to put direct pressure on the local governments. Therefore, matters that greatly stimulated the feelings of the Chinese people had decreased. Under the circumstances of these two aspects, the action aspect of the student movement had almost come to a standstill. However, the standstill on the action front was precisely what promoted the enthusiasm of all sectors for studying the current situation. As a result, gatherings with the names of lecture meetings, discussion meetings, and research studies, which were no different from roundtable discussions, appeared one after another. At this time, the participants in various gatherings suddenly became enthusiastic. Over the months, social celebrities and teachers from various schools, who had been almost completely isolated from the student community due to differing passions and opinions, gradually began to participate in these gatherings again. Those with radical ideas were also touched by the so-called united front theory that swept the country, and their opinions were slightly restrained. Therefore, the exchange of different opinions and the discussion of matters of common concern gradually became possible. Until September and October, most of these gatherings had adopted the name of roundtable discussion. In November, the outbreak of the Suiyuan War gave the people here near the front line an extremely great stimulus. The Suiyuan support movement flourished for a time and was unparalleled. How to provide assistance was an urgent issue. Therefore, the importance of discussion and the exchange of opinions was also recognized by everyone. As a result, all gatherings of this kind were uniformly called roundtable discussions. When various schools, groups, or circles jointly held such gatherings, there were also so-called expanded roundtable discussions. By this point, the name of roundtable discussion had been universally adopted by social figures. The number of people it netted and the frequency of meetings were even greater than in the first period (that is, before January of last year). It was already commonplace for several large and small roundtable discussions to be held simultaneously throughout the city on the same day. During the previous period of suspension of classes, the gatherings held by social figures, teachers from various schools, and students throughout the city, and also crowned with the name of roundtable discussion, were really more than ten times over. This was the fourth stage of the second period of "roundtable discussions," and also the most prosperous stage since Beiping had so-called roundtable discussions. The issues discussed were mostly directly or indirectly related to the Suiyuan War, and the targets of the exchange of opinions were mostly concrete proposals on how to assist the Suiyuan War.</p>
<p>The second period of roundtable discussions in Beiping has a total of four stages of development. The period it has undergone has been described above. However, the roundtable discussions of the past year are clearly different from the roundtable discussions of several years ago in several points: (1) The latter often contained an internal meaning, with more criticism than suggestions. The former arose under the circumstances of imminent foreign invasion, so the flavor of foreign affairs was strong. When it touched on internal affairs, it was often able to shift direction and strengthen foreign emotions. (2) The latter had a fixed organization, and there were dedicated people responsible. The former was a temporary free gathering, and the conveners were sometimes not fixed. (3) The latter was attended mostly by students and was not adopted by the general public. The former has almost become the necessary form for gatherings in the entire society where various opinions are exchanged and programs are discussed. Although the names are the same, the two cannot be mentioned in the same breath.</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, in its former heyday, produced 15 million yuan annually. In recent years, it has been completely ruined. The reason for this is nothing more than backward technology and a failure to innovate, resulting in an inability to compete with foreign porcelain. The local authorities of this province, in order to save the porcelain industry, intend to establish a national kiln factory according to the former imperial kiln system, so as to serve as a demonstration and guiding center. This national kiln factory has had its plans drafted by the Pottery Bureau and sent to the Ministry of Industry for review. It is said that the National Economic Construction Movement Committee is urging its establishment. The method is to establish seven factories under the national kiln factory: (1) The Unborn Factory, manufacturing thin-bodied plates, bowls, and the like; (2) The Large Piece Factory, manufacturing bottles, jars, and pots of 300 grades and above; (3) The Pink Decoration Factory, manufacturing bottles, jars, and pots below 300 grades; (4) The Carving and Inlaying Factory, manufacturing various non-circular items; (5) The Blue and White Factory, underglaze decoration; (6) The Colorful Rainbow Factory, overglaze decoration; (7) The Kiln Factory, specializing in firing. The start-up equipment cost for the above is 100,000 yuan, the annual cost is 30,000 yuan, and it can produce 100,650 pieces of porcelain annually.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shandong Province: Completion of the Library Building and Grand Exhibition of Shanzuo Bronze Inscriptions, Cultural Relics, Books, and Paintings <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Provincial Library, established on the shores of Daming Lake during the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, was initially housed in a purely old-style building. The pavilions, terraces, flowers, and trees were flourishing, and the originally built picture storage building was grand in scale. However, in recent years, due to lack of repair, seepage and peeling were unavoidable. During the May 3rd Massacre, the building was hit by Japanese artillery fire, with shells piercing the roof. In the summer of the 19th year, the gunpowder depot north of the city exploded, causing further shocks, leading to the sinking of the floors and a precarious state. Furthermore, after the 18th year, the number of books increased, exceeding twice the original collection. Therefore, a plan was made to construct a new building, using 50,000 yuan from the salt license registration fees during Zhang Zongchang's era as a foundation. In the 23rd year, the design was estimated, and construction began in March of the 24th year, and was completed in October, costing over 60,000 yuan. Considering that Kuixing governs Lu and Xuxing governs Qi, the building was named "Kuixu Shucang." Recently, the equipment and layout have finally been completed, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for the 13th of this month. The library has a very rich collection of bronze inscriptions and books. The director, Wang Xiantang, is taking the opportunity of the opening ceremony to hold an exhibition, bringing together collectors of Shanzuo bronze inscriptions, cultural relics, books, and paintings for a grand exhibition. In addition to the bronze inscriptions and cultural relics exhibition room and the Qilu Arts and Literature Exhibition Hall below the building, there is also a calligraphy and painting exhibition. The exhibition will last for ten days from the opening day. The following is a summary of the contents of each section:</p>
<p>Bronze Inscriptions and Cultural Relics Exhibition Room: The room houses bronze ware, jade ware, porcelain, pottery, books, and small stone carvings, all of which are changed from time to time. Collectors also temporarily send hundreds of exhibits, limited to the Shang and Zhou dynasties, not including the Wei, Jin dynasties and later. Among the most famous at home and abroad are various utensils unearthed in Teng County and Yidu, four Zhou Mengshi Dui, Zhou Qibo Meifu Dui, Zhou Zui Dui, Zhou Yuanfu Dui, Zhou Ling Dui, Zhou Jiu Dui, Zhou Shi Yin Gui, Shang Gui Youxing Ding, Shang Gui Youxing Xie, Shang Ni Jue, Zhou Qi Cong Ding, Zhou Qi Cong Zhi, Zhou Qi Cong Gu, Zhou Qi Cong Zhi, Zhou Cong Jue (above are bronze wares), Han Xi Zhong Stone Classics Shang fragments (containing fifty-one characters), Wei Zhengshi Stone Classics Shangshu fragments (containing ten characters).</p>
<p>Qilu Arts and Literature Exhibition Room: It is divided into three sections: books, dictionaries, and rubbings, limited to Shanzuo, also numbering hundreds of items, which are changed from time to time, and borrowed from various collectors. Such as Chen Zhai's Shuowen Jiezi, Jigu Guanyin Kaozheng, Zhai Taowen Shicun, Bao Can Zhai Cang Gu Mu from Weifang, Gao Nanfu Guiyun Ji from Jiaozhou, and landscapes, flowers, grasses, calligraphy and paintings, etc., Wang Yuyang's running script from Xincheng, Liu Shian's regular script and running script from Zhucheng, Zhang Maojun's landscape from Anqiu, Wang Chayou's annotated commentaries on scriptures and portraits, etc., many of which have not been seen outside. There are also many bronze inscription rubbings.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: Antique collectors in Jinan, taking advantage of the opening of the library, have brought out their collections for a centralized public exhibition. Those in charge are Li Jitao, Xin Zhujiu, Kong Jinguang, Huang Xiyue, Xing Zhongcai, Zhuang Zhanyan, etc. They have also borrowed collections from other families, many of which are precious. According to what is known, there is Wang Yan's landscape hanging scroll, worth 3,000 yuan, Song Malin's flower and bird hanging scroll, worth more than 10,000 gold, Qian Chashan's landscape, Shi Tao's landscape and bamboo and stone, Ni Yunlin's landscape, etc., many of which are rare treasures.</p>

<p>Hou Qixiang, a prison official in this county, was dismissed from his post due to a prisoner escape case. Lu Daming, a prison official from Jiading County, was appointed to replace him. Lu had come to Songjiang to take over, but the handover procedures with the previous official had not been completed, so he had not yet taken office. On the evening of the 11th, around 2 o'clock, four serious convicts escaped. It was found that the convicts in Room 18, Wang Asan from Gaoyou, were sentenced to 18 years for extortion, Yang Ada from Gaoyou, was sentenced to 14 years for the same case, Gao Jialun, was sentenced to 14 years for murder, and Fei Liu from Anhui, was a thief who had not yet been sentenced, escaped by breaking through the ceiling and scaling the wall. After the county magistrate received the report, he personally led the army and police to pursue them, but they have not yet been apprehended. Gao Amin and Xu Aba, who were also in Room 18, had their shackles sawed off but did not manage to escape, suggesting a conspiracy. They are currently being interrogated.</p>

<p>Since the Anti-Smoking Headquarters issued a clear order that all drug offenders would be shot starting from New Year's Day of the 26th year, the county's Anti-Smoking Association held a second enlarged anti-drug publicity meeting at 1:00 PM on the 13th in the Tonggeng Hall of the park. Li Teping from the Anti-Smoking Association, Xu Yingtou from the county government, Yan Junsen from the security team, He Yingshan from the court, Pan Yongnian from the county party headquarters, Yu Shenhan from the Public Security Bureau, and representatives from various groups and schools, totaling two to three thousand people, attended. Li Teping presided over the meeting and reported on the progress of anti-drug efforts. It was decided that Xu Yingtou and others would deliver speeches successively, hoping that drug offenders would wake up early and avoid the death penalty.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Appeal for Joint Silkworm Rearing <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Association Federation believes that in order to improve the silk industry, it is necessary to actively promote joint silkworm rearing, so that satisfactory results can be achieved. The Jiangsu Silk Industry Improvement Fee has now accumulated a large amount. It should be taken from the silk industry and used for the silk industry. Yesterday, the association submitted a request to the Construction Department, requesting permission to withdraw a certain percentage from the accumulated improvement fees and designate it specifically for promoting joint silkworm rearing expenses, and formulate a plan for concrete implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Changzhou: Gold and Silver Industry Asks for Tax Exemption <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Junli, chairman of the Wuyi Gold and Silver Industry Association, stated that the Ministry of Finance has revised the business tax regulations, increasing the tax rate for silver shops from 10 per mille to 15 per mille, which is unbearable. Yesterday, he specifically sent a joint letter to the Chamber of Commerce, explaining that the business of silver shops has suffered a blow since women started cutting their hair and decorations were affected. Business has plummeted. Furthermore, after the January 28th Incident, the economy has declined, and rural areas are bankrupt. The transactions of silver shops have no room to survive. If the tax rate is further increased, it would be tantamount to kicking someone when they are down. He requested that the Chamber of Commerce forward the request to the Ministry of Finance, urging it to withdraw the order immediately and continue to collect the original amount of 10 per mille. He also requested that the Bureau of Business Tax be notified to temporarily suspend collection until the issue is resolved, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Jiangyin: Sand People Resist Donation, Arrested <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Qiaotou Street in the Shazhou area of the Third District. It is clear that citizens have jointly closed the market for the collection of donations. Zizha once reported before the war on the truth of the matter. It was that Jiang Fazeng, a cadre sent by the main team, and Deng Ronggen and other merchants in the third district who collected donations, quarreled in opposition and posted slogans. Wang, a patrol officer from the Yangku Public Security Bureau, passed by and arrested Deng and others for unreasonable trouble and detained them. At that time, the merchants in the town were used by a small number of people to plan a strike to provide assistance. They learned of the situation and did not proceed. Deng and the other two are still in Yangku and may be dealt with leniently. The turmoil will not expand.</p>

<p>Dongtai Lake is a huge flood storage reservoir in Jiangnan and the main source of irrigation. In recent years, it has gradually silted up. Last spring, merchants and others carried out large-scale land reclamation, obstructing the water source and having a huge impact. The project to rectify the waterways is becoming increasingly urgent. In order to actively start dredging work, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Project Office has specially sent its deputy engineer Cheng Zhenhua and others to survey the area. They will return to the province within days. After Cheng Zhenhua reports the survey situation to the office, the office will formulate a dredging plan based on the plan. According to a person in charge of the office, the Dongtai Lake Dredging Project Office will be established next month, and the personnel are being selected.</p>

It also telegraphed the provincial department to extend the surcharge period. The surcharges were only levied in accordance with regulations starting from the 11th of this month. According to statistics, as of December 10th, the percentage of grain households who paid the first installment of new tax for the 25th year was more than 60%, totaling more than 500,000 yuan.

<p>The Ledewu Highway from Leping to Dewu and from Dewu to Wuyuan were built in the autumn of the 23rd year and the spring of the 24th year, respectively. Although the earthwork bridges and culverts of the two roads have been roughly completed, the road surface has not been paved. Furthermore, due to lack of repair for a long time, the roadbed and bridges have mostly collapsed and silted up, making it impossible to travel. Last month, the three county governments received a face-to-face instruction from Chairman Xiong relayed by the special commissioner's office, ordering the road to be built by a certain date to facilitate transportation. After receiving the order, the Leping area has taken the lead in recruiting strong laborers to repair and build the road, and it has been decided to complete it soon, with a total of more than 40 kilometers of road, more than 20 bridge holes, and more than 10 water pipes to be repaired. The Dewu area is being planned by the county government, but the Wuyuan area needs to raise funds before construction can begin.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Western League Reserve Group: Donghua B Wins the Championship, Winning Lux 2-1 Yesterday for Eight Wins in Eight Games. The Outcome of the Final Game Against the French Chamber of Commerce is Irrelevant to the Overall Situation. <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Donghua Reserve Group played Lux at Hongkou Park. Because the championship was at stake, the entire Donghua team was cautious. Lux is a strong team and even had players from their A team participating, making their momentum very impressive. After the start of the game, Donghua's Luo Haiguang was late, and they had to play with only ten players. Less than three minutes into the match, Lux's center forward, Ingram, attacked and scored, rolling into the net with an elbow thrust. Lux took the lead. After ten minutes, Luo Haiguang arrived, and the forward line began to coordinate. Ding Zhaocheng shot from 30 yards, cutting across the crossbar into the net, tying the score 1-1. After that, both sides had opportunities but were unsuccessful. As the first half was about to end, Luo Haiguang received assistance from Mai Jiliang and headed the ball from close range, bouncing off a defender into the goal. Donghua took a 2-1 lead in the first half. After halftime, Lux intensified their defense. As the final whistle blew, the score remained 2-1. Donghua won. Since the start of the Reserve Group competition, the order has been brought forward due to good weather. Now it has reached the eighth week. All teams except Lux and Xibu have two games remaining. The rest only have one game left. Donghua has played eight games and won all of them, leading the standings with 16 points, maintaining an undefeated record. Although there is still one game against the French Chamber of Commerce, the outcome is irrelevant to the overall situation because the point difference is three points. Therefore, the championship is already in Donghua's pocket. Although Donghua has given up hope for the A League championship, winning a reserve league championship can also be considered as losing something in the east and finding it in the west.</p>

In the second half, Qingxi's warriors were at full strength, and their momentum greatly increased. The vanguard gradually pressed forward, and the left inside forward scored a goal to open the scoring. Zhonghua was furious, and the center forward killed in a single shot and scored a goal to level the score. Then Qingxi had a corner kick opportunity, scored a goal, and the score became 2-1.

In terms of strength, Zhonghua is not weaker than Qingxi, but several good generals failed to participate, and they fought with ten people from beginning to end, so they were defeated.</p>

<p>The Jinan football team met the French Chamber of Commerce again yesterday at Shenyuan for the second cycle of the Shanghai League A. The Jinan side had a university league championship game with Fudan the day before. After a fierce battle, they had not recovered from fatigue, and their strength was far behind. Therefore, after the contest, the game was spent in a one-sided situation. The entire game only had four or five chances to cross the center line and shoot at the goal, which can be said to be non-existent. Occasionally, there were one or two, but the shots were weak and could not fly over the strict defense lines of Ma Williehart and Bao Saizhong. The general situation of yesterday's game can be included in the above words. As for the progress sequence, after the whistle sounded, the French Chamber of Commerce started the ball. Bao Xiutuo immediately advanced to the baseline and shot far away. Only three minutes later, Roberts Tove opened the scoring. After five minutes, Li Danini headed the ball to make it 2-0. Three minutes later, Roberts Tove came again. Ye saved the danger, but the ball did not fly far. Jemwart took the opportunity and kicked the upper left corner, 3-0. After supporting for a long time, Roberts Tove shot from 12 yards and hit the target, 4-0. After that, Ye Peichu and Guan Zhiyang showed their skills and saved many dangerous balls, but in the first half, Jemwart scored another goal from 15 yards, ending the half with 5-0. After halftime, the ball was still hovering in Jinan's defense area. It took 25 minutes of stalemate before they lost again. After many twists and turns, they finally lost their strength and could not last. The French Chamber of Commerce's left wing swept in again, and Bao Xiutuo shot and hit the target, adding to 6-0. After that, within four minutes, Roberts Tove, Jemwart, and Lie Que scored three goals in succession, instantly increasing the score to 9-0. One minute before the end of the game, Jemwart scored again, ending the game with a 10-0 victory for the French Chamber of Commerce. According to Jinan, although they lost 6-1 when they met the French Chamber of Commerce last time, they still attacked and defended each other and shot at the goal. Yesterday's game was not because Jinan regressed, but because of the difference between work and rest, and because the strength of the French Chamber of Commerce was much stronger than when they first met.</p>

<p>The academic lecture jointly organized by the Municipal Society and the China Arts Society should have held its third lecture on the 13th of this month according to the lecture schedule.

<p>Nantong College Nantong College teachers and students decided on three items for the aid Suiyuan movement: (1) Implement a one-day frugality movement. (2) All freely donate. (3) Telegraph condolences to the frontline soldiers. In addition, in order to expand publicity and awaken the masses, the college suspended classes for one day on the 20th of last month and jointly organized with Nantong agencies, schools, and groups to set off to various townships to promote the movement. As of the 5th of this month, the college had raised 1,000 yuan in aid to Suiyuan donations, which has now been handed over to the college's textile department to purchase raw materials and make bandages and sheets, and the medical department has produced its own slurry and blood消 for the needs of rear hospitals.</p>
<p>Guangdong Primary and Secondary Schools The teachers and students of Guangdong Primary and Secondary Schools in Zhabei held a school-wide donation rally for aid Suiyuan days ago and decided on several measures: (1) All teachers and students will implement a one-day donation movement. Teachers and staff donate one day's salary, and students freely donate for one day, totaling more than 200 yuan, which has been remitted to the Guangdong Fellow Association for collection. (2) Implement a frugality movement students.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Overview of Shanghai Municipal Council Schools (7) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper Hu Zuyin Investigation</p>
<p>Each semester, the school holds parent-teacher conferences, entertainment gatherings, achievement exhibitions, and sports meets, and invites parents to visit the school. Report cards are issued twice each semester, with detailed reports on the children's academic performance, behavior, attendance, and absences. Each school also uses a school-family communication sheet, which is specifically for communication between the school and the family. Every Saturday, the children bring this sheet home for their parents to review, and then bring it back to the school on Monday for the teachers to review. Teachers or parents can sign their opinions or raise questions on the communication sheet so that they can understand or answer each other.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to understand the parents' opinions on the school's facilities, the school specifically solicits parents' opinions by printing written questionnaires, asking parents to express their specific opinions on issues such as the school's curriculum, teaching, training, and management. The school authorities collect and compile the opinions of the parents to serve as the basis for improving school affairs. For individual problematic children, the class teachers often visit the children's homes to understand the environment in which the children live and to discuss with the parents the methods of teaching the children.</p>
<p>XIV. Implementation of the Two-Part System</p>
<p>In July of the 23rd year, Mr. Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Municipal Council, was sent abroad to Europe to inspect education. Mr. Chen traveled to countries such as England, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, and the Soviet Union for seven months. Mr. Chen, seeing that the governments of European countries were working hard to promote compulsory education and widely establishing two-part schools to help promote compulsory education (such as in Poland), suggested to the School Affairs Committee of the Municipal Council after returning to China that two-part primary schools be established to promote compulsory education in the concession. This suggestion was adopted by the Municipal Council, and a two-part primary school was first established on Peng Road in February of the 25th year as a preliminary trial.</p>
<p>The two-part primary school is to use full-day school buildings and teachers to divide classes into morning and afternoon shifts to achieve the goal of enrolling twice as many students. There are four classes each morning and afternoon, each class lasting 40 minutes; therefore, each part of the students can take 960 minutes of classes per week. In terms of curriculum, technical subjects such as work, music, and physical education are appropriately reduced according to the number of hours prescribed by the ministry: at the same time, the review work of knowledge subjects such as Chinese, arithmetic, and common sense is designed to allow children to study and do it themselves at home, so as to reduce the time spent practicing in the classroom.</p>
<p>Since the school has been piloting the two-part system, it has not felt any major difficulties in teaching. However, because most of the parents of the school's students work outside during the day, they do not have time to guide and supervise the children's self-study work in the morning or afternoon, so the children's self-study work is inevitably affected to a considerable extent. Another point is that the work undertaken by the school's teachers is more important than the work undertaken by teachers in other schools; on average, each teacher in the school undertakes 1,360 minutes per week, and the student homework that is corrected outside of class is also more than that of teachers in other schools.</p>
<p>XV. Overview of Night Schools</p>
<p>Seeing the plight of apprentices in various factories in the public and community boundaries who are out of school, the Municipal Council first established a male worker night school at the Jingzhou Road Primary School of the Bureau in October of the 23rd year. The worker night school enrolls apprentices working in factories and provides them with considerable remedial education during their spare time. The age of the students is stipulated to be from 12 to 20 years old. The simple courses taught include Chinese, calligraphy, arithmetic, and common sense (including hygiene and citizenship). Later, in order to meet the needs of the students, three elective courses were added: English, singing, and physical education.</p>
<p>When the worker night school was opened, there were a total of 264 students, representing workers from all aspects; the number of people engaged in canning, bookbinding, dyeing, iron industry, light bulb manufacturing, printing, and glass manufacturing was the largest. The number of night school students has increased every semester; by the spring of the 25th year, the number of students had increased to 508. Seeing the development and needs of the night school, the Municipal Council added a female worker night school in February of the 25th year. The school is attached to the Huishan Road East District Girls' Primary School building and specializes in enrolling female workers from various factories in the East District. All facilities are roughly the same as those of the male worker night school. When the school opened, there were 310 students, and it is expected to continue to increase and develop in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e89">After the Xi'an Incident News Reached Shanghai, All Sectors Sent Telegrams Urging Zhang Xueliang <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Since Zhang Xueliang led his troops in an unusual move and seized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the news has shocked all sectors of this city. The Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal General Labor Union, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Education Association, and various trade associations have all sent telegrams to Zhang Xueliang, urging him to turn back from the precipice as soon as possible and restore Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's freedom, so as not to let the country and the nation suffer. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Telegram</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Zhang Hanqing (Zhang Xueliang) of Xi'an, in your esteemed judgment, at this time when foreign enemies are pressing on the border and their advance is directed westward, it is precisely when we should unite internally and resist the enemy together. Now that the good news of the victory in Suiyuan has just arrived and the recovery of lost territories is within sight, you have suddenly taken military action. To say nothing of inviting a thief into the house, which is not permissible by the whole country, the overall national policy cannot be determined by one person. May we ask, if internal strife arises before the foreign enemy is repelled, causing the country to lose its vitality and creating opportunities for the enemy, aiming to resist the enemy in the beginning but ending up aiding the enemy, coming to save the country but leaving with a disaster, what will the world say of you? Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has endured hardships and persevered, making painstaking efforts to resist foreign aggression and save the country, planning carefully before taking action. Now that the unity of the country has just been initially achieved and the international status is gradually rising, how can you suddenly shatter the established situation, repeat the fragmentation, cut your feet to fit the shoes, and give others a handle? We fear that before your lost land in the Northeast is recovered, the Northwest will follow the Northeast. Moreover, the hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front lines are fighting to defend the country, but if they suddenly lose their commander, they will have nowhere to advance or retreat, and will they not be completely placed in a dead end? Considering that you enjoy the special favor of Chairman Chiang and receive generous treatment from the country, you should not bear to make such a rebellious act against national law. We sincerely hope that you will turn back from the precipice, protect the commander, release the troops, and safeguard the overall situation. With utmost anticipation, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters bows in respect.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Telegram</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, the current international situation is changing rapidly, and China's environment is becoming increasingly perilous. What we seek is China's freedom and equality, and we believe that only by advancing forward as a nation can we strengthen our national power and promote our national prestige. In recent years, the central government has been rectifying national defense and striving for construction, wholeheartedly seeking unity and training the people for self-defense, with painstaking management, all of which are facts. Moreover, the recent dispatch of a large army to slowly suppress bandits is the initial step in launching national policy. If we can take unified steps and obey the central government, then the nation's revival can be expected soon. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment when the front lines are frequently reporting victories and national morale is being promoted, we suddenly heard that your subordinates had taken unusual actions in Lintong and placed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in a dangerous situation. The more than eight hundred thousand laborers in Shanghai are extremely shocked. The Chairman is the supreme leader of our country, wholeheartedly devoted to saving the country, working tirelessly day and night. He trusts you wholeheartedly and entrusts you with important responsibilities. Although the truth of this incident is not yet clear, we hope that you will promptly and severely punish the rebellious troops, protect the leader, and show the world, preserving your final good name. Otherwise, betraying the country and harming the people will inevitably lead to failure. The lessons of the past are a warning. We hope that you will seriously consider it. The Shanghai General Labor Union bows in respect.</p>
<p>Cultural Organizations</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, at a time when two major turbulent tides in the world are rampant, all those who seek to preserve and develop the survival of their country and nation invariably want to base themselves on the spirit of independence and autonomy, and advocate saving the country from a local standpoint. Today, China has fallen into the intersection of these two major turbulent tides, and whether leaning to the left or to the right is enough to be drawn into the whirlpool and be offered as a painful sacrifice. Spain has already been reduced to an internationalist target range, and the sacrifice of national power and the lives of the people has reached a point of no return. The lesson from the past is not far away and should be chilling. Today, our country has adopted an absolutely autonomous and independent stance, and has established a national policy of eliminating traitors and resisting foreign aggression. Those who are manipulated by outsiders, divide China's territory, and undermine national sovereignty will all be placed in the ranks of traitors and severely suppressed. This is indeed the most self-preserving and self-saving way for China. The central government has adhered to this national policy for ten years, constantly bearing it in mind, from beginning to end. Our Chairman, inheriting this purpose and responsible for its implementation, is all about avoiding the war of internationalism and seeking self-preservation and self-rescue in the process. Now, just as the work of eliminating traitors in Suiyuan is being fought and won, a move to invite a thief into the house has suddenly been made in Shaanxi, destroying the sacred stance and throwing oneself into the embrace of demons, not only repeating the tragic disaster of domestic division but also inviting huge foreign plunder from abroad, being at the mercy of others. Is the tragedy of Spain not enough to teach us a lesson? Turning back from the precipice is the right time. The one who tied the bell must untie it. It is hoped that the wise will understand the principle of obedience and defiance and handle it well. The Chinese Cultural Construction Association, the Shanghai Boy Scout Council, the Shanghai Cooperative Business Promotion Association, the Shanghai Sports Promotion Association, the Shanghai Elementary Education Promotion Association, the Chinese Spiritual Research Association, the Wharf Business Office, the National News Agency, the Dagong News Agency, the Joint Association of Universities, the Shanghai News Agency, the Cultural Construction Monthly Magazine, the Chinese Labor Association, the Reading Youth Society, the Breeze Literary Society, and other eighty-three organizations bow in respect.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Educational Organizations</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, at this time when the national crisis is serious, the Suiyuan battle is intense, and the soldiers on the front lines are winning victories, we suddenly see reports that you have actually seized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek with force, which is extremely shocking. Indeed, the dangerous situation in our country has reached a critical juncture. Only by uniting as a nation can we jointly resist foreign aggression, and only by acting in accordance with the overall national policy can we achieve the goal of national revival. Now, the unification has been declared complete and the suppression of bandits and puppets is imminent, but this unfortunate event has occurred. If it shakes the morale of the army and affects the overall situation, who will be responsible for the destruction of China? Moreover, as a soldier, you should take obedience to orders, building the army and defending the country as your duty. If your subordinates also follow suit and act freely, then discipline will be lost, how can you explain yourself? Time is critical and the situation is pressing. We urgently hope that you will quickly restore order, turn back from the precipice, and not let those close to you grieve and those who hate you rejoice. This telegram cannot express all our hopes and prayers. The Shanghai Farmers' Association, the Shanghai Education Association, and the Shanghai Secondary School Joint Association bow in respect.</p>
<p>Citizens' Association Telegram</p>
<p>(Title omitted) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the national leader and revolutionary mentor, loyal and determined, and loved and respected by the whole country. With his decisive strategies for foreign affairs, command of military affairs, and resistance to foreign aggression, good news is frequently reported. The people of the country are celebrating the hope of national revival, but suddenly we hear that you have seized the chairman and rebelled against the party and the country, which has shocked and angered the whole country. At this time when everyone is of one mind and united against foreign aggression, it is absolutely impossible to act rashly, destroy our own national strength. This telegram is sent to express this. We hope that you will deeply understand this, restore the chairman's freedom, and await the central government's disposition, so as not to cut yourself off from the people of the country. This telegram cannot express all our hopes and prayers. The United Association of Citizens of the Second Special District of Shanghai bows in respect and stamps its seal.</p>
<p>The New Sound Society said that the various trade associations in this city sent telegrams yesterday to Zhang Hanqing, urging him to repent and asking Yang Hucheng to mediate nearby. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhang Hanqing</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, in recent years, the enemy has penetrated deeply and the national crisis is serious. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the central authorities have been supporting us through the difficulties. Recently, Suiyuan issued an alarm, and the whole country rose up, demonstrating that resisting foreign aggression and seeking survival is the unanimous will of the whole country. Now that the situation has stabilized somewhat, it is just the beginning of a transformation. The road ahead is thorny, but hope will come along with it. We need unity from top to bottom and to move forward under the overall national policy of the central government. Then, even if only three households were left, would China not have a chance to revive? But the news has come that you have been misled by extreme opinions and have taken the central government hostage. Hearing this from afar, we are extremely shocked. Saving the country lies in unity, both in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, and respecting the central government and obeying the leader are essential elements of unity and saving the country. Otherwise, we will destroy our own front lines and become the cause of disaster, only giving others the opportunity to devour and encroach on us, leaving us in a place of no return. In that case, those who speak of resisting the enemy will instead aid the enemy, and those who call for saving the country will instead destroy the country. How could those who are sincerely concerned about the country and love the country bear to see this? We respectfully ask you to think of your past loyalty to the leader and your devotion to the country, repent and strive to extricate yourself, obey the central government, and obey the leader. Wisdom, foolishness, virtue, and incompetence all depend on this one thought. We sincerely plead and hope that you will consider and accept our words. It would be our greatest fortune. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry, Western Medicine Industry, Woolen Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Paper Industry, Miscellaneous Grain Industry, Soybean Cake Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Sausage Industry, Gunny Bag Industry, Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and 173 other trade associations in Shanghai bow in respect.</p>
<p>Telegram to Yang Hucheng</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Yang, Pacification Commissioner of Xi'an, the news has spread that the old Northeast Army has taken unusual actions in Shaanxi, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has not been sent to a safe area. Upon hearing this, the whole country is shocked. Resisting foreign aggression to save the country is the consistent national policy predetermined by the central government, and diplomatic and national defense matters are also planned carefully. All of our countrymen should have no divisions and concentrate national power under the overall guidance to alleviate the national crisis. It is absolutely inappropriate to disperse forces and destroy the foundation ourselves. The minority of the old Northeast Army under the command of Mr. Zhang Hanqing should, at this time of extreme national crisis, even if they have any opinions, follow proper procedures, suggest to the government, and make proposals. If the proposals are in line with the national situation, the central authorities will naturally consult widely and will also commend them. But to rashly take this inferior course, we fear it is not Mr. Hanqing's original intention. Mr. Chiang's safety concerns the fate of the country, and it is inappropriate to stay in Xi'an for a long time. We should ask you to persuade Mr. Hanqing nearby to consider the overall situation, escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to a safe area as soon as possible, and restore the original state of the region. As for the major national plans, we can discuss them at length to ensure perfection and benefit the country. We hope that you will not go against public opinion, and please convey our message well. The people of Shanghai offer incense and prayers and make urgent pleas with the utmost anticipation.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sausage Industry, Letterpress Printing Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Fur Industry, New-Style Laundry Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Medicine Material Industry, Silk Thread Industry, Knitting Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Western Cigarette Industry, Timber Industry, Opium Industry, Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and 85 other trade associations jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government in Nanjing, saying: (Omitted from the front) The matter concerns the future of the party and the country and the safety of the leader. We respectfully ask you to follow the people's wishes and handle it properly. We are deeply concerned and pray.</p>
<p>Five Organizations Telegram</p>
<p>Five organizations including the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Banking Industry, the Money Exchange Industry, and the Shipping Industry jointly decided to send a public telegram to Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an, asking him to prioritize the country and the nation and to ensure the safety of Chiang Kai-shek and maintain the overall situation.</p>
<p>Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association held an emergency meeting yesterday morning after reports that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had been detained by rebel soldiers in Xi'an. Committee members Yu Hualong, Wang Lianfang, Wang Jitang, He Pinglong, Chen Siyu, etc. attended the discussion and decided to send a telegram to the National Government, demanding strict punishment. The telegram is recorded as follows: To the esteemed National Government, upon reading reports that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had been detained by rebel soldiers in Xi'an, we were shocked and dismayed. At a time when domestic and foreign troubles are on the verge of exploding, Zhang Xueliang dared to seize the commander-in-chief and resort to illegal coercion, which is extremely unlawful. We request that you severely punish him to uphold discipline. The Shanghai Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association bows in respect.</p>

A reporter from the New Sound Society met Mr. Liu in the corridor yesterday. According to him, he has been serving in Guangdong for a long time since taking office. Now, due to various official duties, he needs to consult with the central government, so he came north specially. He is scheduled to return south in two weeks. The various political situations in Guangdong Province in recent years have shown progress. Given enough time, it will definitely get better. Regarding construction, all financial matters will be carried out in accordance with the budget. If necessary, additional funds will be raised temporarily. Regarding the construction policy, he has already mentioned before, that is, to temporarily maintain the existing businesses and make them sound. Because all new projects cannot be done without large sums of money, and now that finances are difficult, there is no such amount of money for the time being. We only hope that the people will invest and use foreign capital. The use of foreign capital is originally the policy of our Kuomintang. Under the principle of not harming sovereignty, it is certainly permissible. In the past, foreigners were skeptical about investing in our country, but now, because they see that our country is unified and the credit is strengthened, they are happy to invest and are contacting us one after another. Furthermore, the Guangdong Provincial Government is now planning a "Three-Year Construction Plan," which is completely based on reality. Whatever can be done will be done, and empty words will not be spoken. All things that cannot be done temporarily will not be included, and so on. Also, Mr. Li Luchao, Director of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, arrived in Shanghai on the same ship as Mr. Liu to consult with the Ministry of Railways on railway matters.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Ministry of Industries Issues Order for Adoption of Domestic Litedon Powder; Provincial Government Instructs All Counties to Use as Much as Possible in the Paint Industry to Stop Losses <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai East Asia Paint Industry Factory Co., Ltd., recognizing that China's old-style aluminum powder is made from aluminum nitrate, is explosive and contains toxic substances, which is detrimental to health. The prohibition of its use by domestic laborers is not without reason. The factory's current product, Litedon powder, commonly known as zinc white powder, is made from a mixture of pure zinc and barite. It is of good quality and does not contain toxic components. It is an essential raw material for making paints and rubber, and is indeed a high-quality substitute for white aluminum. It has been chemically tested by the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Testing Institute and issued a certificate. The annual import volume of white pigment Litedon powder is very large. It is a substitute for white aluminum, and the paint industry has already seen results in using imported Litedon powder to replace white aluminum, so there is no need to further promote it and increase imports. Therefore, it is requested that the Ministry of Industries maintain domestic production and issue an order to the social bureaus of all provinces and cities to instruct the paint industry to adopt domestic Litedon powder to stop losses and save rights and interests. Based on this, the Ministry of Industries previously felt that there was a lack of domestic white aluminum substitutes, and advocated temporarily suspending approval of the draft proposal passed by the Third National Labor Congress to prohibit the use of white aluminum in the paint industry. Now, the Litedon powder produced by the company can be a substitute for aluminum, and the domestic paint industry should adopt it as much as possible to promote it. The Ministry of Industries forwarded the order to the province, and in addition to issuing separate orders, specifically instructed the Provincial Department of Construction to instruct all paint industries under its jurisdiction to adopt it. (The company's office is located in Tailai Lane, Maigen Road, Shanghai, and the factory is located in Hengyi West Road, Zhabei, Shanghai.) The Jiangsu Department of Construction, upon receiving the order, submitted a report to the Provincial Government, which yesterday specifically instructed all commissioners and county magistrates to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Bondholders' Meeting of the Tongyi Trust Company Fails; Changed to a Discussion Meeting <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Tongyi Trust Company held its third meeting of bank creditors yesterday at 1:00 PM at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road. The attendance of creditors was not enthusiastic. After the meeting started on time, a judge from the Special District Court, acting as chairman, reported that the total number of creditors was over 1,400, with more than 1.6 million yuan owed. However, the total number of attendees was only over 590, representing over 700,300 yuan, which was less than half. Therefore, the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting. The bankruptcy administrator, accountant Li Ding, reported on the liquidation of accounts, and Xu Shihao, a lawyer representing the company's board of directors, reported on the contents of the resumption negotiations and coordination plan. After each creditor expressed their opinions, Judge Wang delivered a speech, stating that the coordination plan required the consent of three-quarters of the total number of creditors to be approved, and the amount of repayment should also be better than the bankruptcy method. It is currently far from the facts and can be temporarily not discussed. As the third resolution to convene a meeting failed, and creditors from other places were unable to attend, it is proposed that the court make a variation and convene meetings separately in various places, pending a ruling. The meeting was then adjourned. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that the auditors elected by the savings department last Sunday were also requesting the court to interpret the legal quorum. In addition, after the stolen pledged bonds were cashed and the pledged amount was returned, there was still 100,000 yuan remaining, which creditors have strongly demanded to be returned in the short term.</p>

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, in the case of Chen Xihou, assignee of the China Industrial Bank, declared bankruptcy on September 20 of last year. The bankruptcy procedure should continue to be carried out. Yesterday, the court issued a public notice for the second resolution of the creditors' meeting, stating: "After the court declared bankruptcy the case of Lu Xihou, assignee of the China Industrial Bank, a creditors' meeting has been convened.

<p>Du Sanzhen Fresh Meat Shop in Nine Acres, opened by a Chaozhou native surnamed Lan, has recently experienced sluggish business. A month ago, the owner of the shop met a runner from the China Cotton Weaving Factory on the road, who said that there were Chaozhou merchants who wanted to purchase large quantities of cotton towels and cotton products for sale in other ports. The runner, attracted by the business, agreed on a price with Lan and delivered the goods to the fresh meat shop, using the Du Sanzhen receipt as proof. The next day, he went to collect the payment and received a check from a bank with a ten-day date, which was cashed in full upon maturity. Since then, the amount of goods traded has been increasing. The latest batch of towels and cotton goods sold was paid for with a check dated the 12th of this month. Unexpectedly, the shop suddenly hired a lawyer last night to announce liquidation and posted a notice asking all creditors to clarify their claims and register at the law office within 14 days for liquidation. The runner from the China Cotton Weaving Factory, believing that Lan should not have used fraudulent means to obtain a large quantity of towels, has hired a lawyer to oppose the liquidation. He demanded that Lan come forward immediately, otherwise he would file a lawsuit in court for fraud and demand compensation for the goods.</p>

<p>Ma Youcai, a 32-year-old employee of the tobacco department of the Zhixin Company on Nanjing Road, sued his wife, Ma Gu, 24 years old, who lives at his home in the Ma family house in Chuansha, in the local court, for adultery with his cousin Ma Sunxi, 32 years old (who works as a clerk at the Jiucheng Lumber Company in Xuejiabang). He claimed that due to his work, he did not often return home, which led to his wife having an affair with Ma Sunxi. He was initially unaware of this until he received a letter from Ma Sunxi's wife and based on witness statements from Xi Daosheng, who lived in the same house, claimed to have seen his wife and Ma Sunxi commit adultery in the Sutai Hotel in April, so he requested legal action and filed a private lawsuit for marriage expenses, etc., totaling 1,000 yuan. Ma Sunxi claimed that on April 14th, he came to Shanghai with his wife to visit his uncle and stayed at the Sutai Hotel, which he called a false accusation. His wife, Ma Sun, also went to court to testify that she was illiterate and could not have written a letter to accuse her husband. The letter was written and signed by Xi Daosheng. A fellow villager, Gao Shiyi, also witnessed Xi writing the letter. Ma Gu claimed that her husband had married her as his fourth wife, and all the previous marriages had ended in divorce. Her husband had once said that a wife is like a dish, and you get tired of eating it after a while and need to change flavors, so he fabricated a story to trap her. Judge Xie summoned Xi Daosheng for questioning again. However, yesterday, the defense lawyer stated that Xi had been arrested in Zhenjiang for being a traitor. The judge then declared the debate closed, and the verdict will be announced on the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Ministry of Communications Rectifies the Shipping Industry; Implements Supervision of Shipping Companies; Stipulates Scheduled and Unscheduled Shipping Routes; Increasing Ships is Based on New Construction in Principle, Restricting Old Ships <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In order to rectify the shipping industry, the Ministry of Communications, in addition to conducting shipping company registration, has also promulgated supervisory regulations, totaling six chapters and twenty-five articles. The main points are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Routes</p>
<p>If the number of ships operating on each route exceeds demand, or in special circumstances, the Ministry of Communications may temporarily impose restrictions and establish a route investigation committee to investigate the number and tonnage of ships required on each route. Scheduled ships should be operated by the owner or agent, listing the origin, destination, and stopover ports along the route, and applying to the competent maritime affairs agency to submit to the Ministry of Communications for approval, and a scheduled ship passage certificate will be issued before navigation. If you want to change or suspend navigation, you must still submit it for approval. Unscheduled ships should be operated by the owner or agent to apply to the competent maritime affairs agency and submit it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. The Ministry of Communications will issue an unscheduled ship passage certificate. If unscheduled ships encounter a large number of passengers and goods waiting to be transported on restricted scheduled ship routes, they should first apply to the competent maritime affairs agency for a temporary passage certificate before they can navigate the route. All scheduled ships that are changed to unscheduled ships, or unscheduled ships that are changed to scheduled ships, should apply to the competent maritime affairs agency for approval and report to the Ministry of Communications for record.</p>
<p>Ship Increases</p>
<p>If shipping companies need to increase ships, they should first prepare an application form, attach drawings and explanations, and submit it to the competent maritime affairs agency to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Increasing ships should be based on new construction in principle. If it is an existing ship, in addition to those registered as valid with the Ministry of Communications, the age of passenger ships is limited to less than fifteen years, and the age of cargo ships is limited to less than twenty years. If the original scheduled ships on restricted routes cannot meet the demand, the Ministry of Communications may determine a time limit and order the shipping companies on the route to increase the number of ships within the time limit through the maritime affairs agency. In the event of the circumstances in the preceding paragraph, if the number and tonnage of ships that need to be increased cannot be evenly distributed among the shipping companies on the route, the Ministry of Communications may order mutual consultation to jointly purchase or lease ships for operation. If the consultation fails, the shipping company that can increase better ships may be approved to operate it. In the event of the above circumstances, if the original shipping companies on the route do not increase ships in accordance with the regulations, the Ministry of Communications may order the maritime affairs agency to order other shipping companies to join the route.</p>
<p>Business</p>
<p>Shipping companies should have all colleagues on the same route understand the local passenger and cargo situation, economic conditions, and refer to transportation costs to determine the highest standard for ticket prices and freight rates, once a year, and submit them to the competent maritime affairs agency for approval to the Ministry of Communications. The ticket prices and freight rates of all shipping companies on the route shall not exceed the highest standard. If shipping companies want to jointly operate or share water fees, they should submit them to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Shipping companies shall not distribute profits unless they have made deductions for depreciation and retained public accumulation funds. Shipping companies shall, within two months after the end of each business year, prepare the following forms and submit them to the competent maritime affairs agency for inspection by the Ministry of Communications. The form styles will be determined separately: (1) Employee roster and salary schedule, (2) Passenger and cargo transportation price list, (3) Passenger and cargo transportation statistics, (4) Ship report, (5) Other business reports, (6) Balance sheet of assets and liabilities and profit and loss statement, with explanations, (7) Investigation table of the production and sales of products in various places where ships sail.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Canine Pest Prevention Institute Formulates Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Bovine Plague; Free Treatment of Bovine Plague to Avoid Concerns About Spring Plowing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Recently, bovine plague has been discovered in Shanghai, especially among the cattle in the four suburban areas. Therefore, the Jiangwan Animal Plague Prevention Institute in Shanghai has repeatedly dispatched veterinarians to the rural suburbs for diagnosis. The results showed that in addition to arthritis, there were also cases of foot-and-mouth disease. The institute believes that if prevention and control are not carried out quickly, it will affect farming. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all milk farms and farmers in Shanghai to provide free treatment, and has formulated guidelines for the prevention and control of bovine plague to be distributed throughout the suburbs. The details are as follows: Bovine plague is a malignant infectious disease of cattle, which spreads very quickly and causes a large number of cattle deaths, often more than 70-80%. The losses to cattle owners are significant. Therefore, all cattle owners should strictly abide by preventive isolation and disinfection methods to avoid infection and huge losses. Once cattle stop eating, are tired, have an increased body temperature, or a reduced milk supply, they should immediately consult a veterinarian to see if it is bovine plague, so that prevention and control can be carried out. The prevention, treatment, isolation and disinfection of bovine plague are described below: (A) Preventive Injection Methods: There are three preventive injection methods: (1) injection of anti-bovine plague serum, (2) injection of bovine plague organ vaccine, (3) injection of bovine plague serum and toxoid. Each has its own use. If used properly, all can prevent bovine plague. (1) Injection of anti-bovine plague serum is the fastest-acting. It can prevent bovine plague immediately after injection, but the effective period can only protect the cattle for one month. Therefore, after one month, it is necessary to inject anti-bovine plague serum or other preventive fluids to be safe. Cattle herds where bovine plague has already been discovered should be injected with anti-bovine plague serum, especially high-value cattle. (2) Injection of bovine plague organ vaccine takes 14 days to take effect after injection. Therefore, the effect is slightly later than that of anti-bovine plague serum, but the effective period can be six months to one year. Cattle herds that have not developed bovine plague but are at risk of infection should be injected with bovine plague organ vaccine. (3) Bovine plague serum and toxoid are injected at the same time. One cow is injected with two drugs, one is bovine plague toxoid and the other is anti-bovine plague serum. Injecting a small amount of bovine plague toxoid can cause the cow to suffer from plague disease. Injecting a large amount of bovine plague serum can protect the cow from suffering from plague. Therefore, after a cow is injected with two drugs, mild plague is often found and soon recovers. Occasionally, some die from serious illness. All these methods are slightly dangerous, and there are occasional losses. However, cows can be free from plague for one or two years after being injected with this type of injection. This method is best used for cattle herds that have already developed bovine plague, and is not suitable for cattle herds that have not developed bovine plague. When using this method, the entire cattle herd must be completely and simultaneously injected. If a portion is injected and the rest is not, there is a risk of bovine plague transmission. It must not be unknown (B) Treatment Methods: In addition to anti-bovine plague serum, which can treat bovine plague, no other effective drugs have yet been invented. The therapeutic effect of serum is best in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, the earlier the treatment of bovine plague, the better. Serum is also ineffective when the disease is severe. (C) Isolation of Sick Cattle and Disinfection of Cowsheds: Once a sick cow is discovered, it should be immediately isolated for feeding to avoid infecting other healthy cows. It is best to move the healthy cows to a new location and thoroughly disinfect the cowshed where the sick cow was kept. The method of disinfection is to spray the walls and floors of the cowshed with a newly prepared 0.05% bleaching powder solution. The entrances and exits of the cowshed should be covered with lime powder or a disinfectant pool should be set up, containing 5% Lysol, Pysll so that shoes and boots can be disinfected when entering and exiting. All utensils in the sick cow shed must be immersed in a 3% Lysol aqueous solution for 12 or 24 hours, or coated with lime water to kill the residual pathogens. (D) Stop the Transportation of Cattle: During the bovine plague epidemic, cattle must not be moved in or out to reduce the chance of infection. The same applies to other livestock, in order to maintain the safety of the area and prevent the spread of the disease. (E) Prohibit Visits: Because the shoes and boots of visitors are not easily disinfected, they often carry viruses to other places, spreading bovine plague. Visits should be prohibited. Other miscellaneous personnel are also prohibited from entering and exiting the cowshed.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the North China Branch of the Relief Committee of the General Association of the Red Cross Society of China, a team has been formed to rush to the front to handle relief affairs, and temporary hospitals have been set up to actively treat wounded soldiers. The work is now very tense. The flags of the Red Cross Society have been spread throughout the Qian area, so the military and civilians are extremely comforted. Yesterday, the representative of the association sent a telegram from Suiyuan, stating that there is a severe shortage of medicines and materials, which is extremely worrying. For example, a single item of alcohol has soared to 25 yuan and cannot be purchased anywhere. Others, such as chloroform, cannot be bought even at high prices. There is also very little gauze and cotton. The Shanghai side is urgently requested to provide assistance quickly. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will quickly donate the above-mentioned medicines and send them to No. 856 Xinzha Road, the General Association of the Red Cross Society of China. The association will immediately transport them to the front.</p>

<p>Zhou Siquan, a farmer from Mashaqiao Shayou Township in Shanghai County, is 26 years old. When he was young, his parents arranged for him to marry He Xianjuan, the daughter of He Heshang from the same village, through a matchmaker. They chose the 21st day of the tenth month of the old calendar this year to get married. When the auspicious day arrived, Zhou Siquan prepared gongs and drums, and a colorful sedan chair to go to the bride's house to welcome her. Unexpectedly, the bride could not be found. The sudden change on the eve of the wedding was extremely surprising. The festive event was spoiled. He took his father-in-law to the Third Police Station for reasoning. Then, the original matchmaker, Yang Jinyun, rushed to say that the bride had been hidden by He Jiping, the village head of the township, and her intentions were unknown. The police chief immediately ordered the senior police officer to go to the address and bring He Jiping and the bride He Xianjuan to the station together. After persuasion by relatives and friends, both parties calmed down. He Jiping was confronted, and He Xianjuan was taken back by Zhou Siquan in the sedan chair. However, the auspicious day had been missed, and it was agreed to change the date for the wedding. However, He Jiping, who suffered this humiliation, was unwilling and filed a complaint with the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, accusing Zhou Siquan of instigating Wang Musheng, Fei Yuehua, Zhou Shulin, and others to illegally kidnap the bride. The bureau ordered the police to detain the four people and send them to the Shanghai District Court. After the prosecutor inquired about the previous situation, he released Zhou and others. After Zhou and others were released, they were very angry and hired lawyer Yang Yiming to countersue for false accusation and obstruction of family.</p>

"At that time, the tide was rising, and instead of dropping the front anchor, they rashly turned the ship to dock. The tide was so rapid at this time that the power of navigation was ineffective. As a result, the ship crossed the river to the opposite side of the Datong Hotel before turning around. At this time, if the ship could maintain a fixed position, there would be no risk of collision with the members' barges. Who knew that at this time, the stern of the ship suddenly slanted into the river bank? The second mate, who was in charge of observing safety at the stern of the ship, clearly knew that the members' ships were in a dangerous situation where they could not avoid it. He did not notify the engine room to stop the ship, causing the three barges of the members to be violently hit and sunk by the stern of the ship. Subsequently, someone was entrusted to salvage the sunken ship. After an estimate of the damage by a shipwright, it was said that it would cost more than 800 yuan to repair. The livelihood of several members of the family depends on this barge transportation. Now, they have suffered this unexpected accident for no reason, and their livelihood is worrying," etc. After sending personnel to the scene of the accident for thorough investigation, it was reported that the barges of member Fan Yunchao and others were indeed docked to the right end of the New Beijing wharf. It was found that the distance between that place and the New Jiangtian steamer wharf was more than 520 meters. If the captain was not careless and able to drop anchor at a fixed anchorage, and the second mate in charge of observing safety at the stern of the ship could fulfill his duties, there would be no reason for the collision. It is clear that the fault lies with the steamer, not the barges," etc. Based on this, we hereby request your bureau to investigate and compensate for the damage in accordance with the provisions of Article 113 of the Maritime Law, in order to alleviate the hardships of the workers.</p>

<p>Chen Dianrong, 44 years old, from Wuxi, lives at No. 320 Fuyou Road in the city. His son, Chen Xiepin, 17 years old, was introduced by Chen Qiyuan in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China and worked as an apprentice at the Huiming Dry Battery Factory opened by Ding Rongzhao at No. 58 Runan Street, Zhaoban Road, Shanghai South. For more than two years, he has been subjected to abuse by foreman Yin Yuzhang and others (28 years old, from Tongzhou, living at No. 5 Changyuanli, Qu Zhenren Road). Although the original introducer and others repeatedly dissuaded them, it was still ineffective. Unexpectedly, at 12 a.m. on the 9th of this month, Chen Xiepin suddenly died in the factory. The factory owner, Ding Rongzhao, paid 26 yuan to prepare a coffin for burial. The deceased's father, Chen Dianrong, believes that the sudden death of his son is unclear, and yesterday he submitted a petition to the Ximen Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation to seek justice. Chief Yao Guangnai approved it and immediately ordered the original witnesses to be brought to the case for detailed interrogation.

Finally, according to the original introducer Chen Qiyuan, who claimed to be the former factory director of the factory, the deceased was introduced by him. Usually, the factory owner treated him harshly, so he often came to cry and wanted to quit. I advised him to be patient and learn his skills. That night, the factory sent two people to say that Chen Xiepin was seriously ill and was quickly sent to the hospital. It was not until the next morning that he found out he had died. After reviewing the confession, the bureau believes that the case involves allegations of abuse and resulted in death. It is believed that the factory owner, Ding Rongzhao, is highly suspected. In addition to first ordering the local security officer to go to the local court for an examination, the police were also dispatched to continue summoning the factory owner to the case for questioning, and the witnesses' original petitions and guarantees were prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

Hongkou District suffered severely during the January 28th Incident because it was adjacent to the war zone. The Haining Road Incident occurred, and Japanese troops set up sentry posts and armed patrols. Residents were intimidated by their power and moved away, resulting in the tragic situation of 'nine out of ten houses being empty.' The industrial and commercial sectors have also declined further. Today, the second landlords in Hongkou District have many vacant houses, and the rent paid is suffering huge losses, while the quarterly house rent is particularly burdensome. Tenant after tenant in that neighborhood has come to the association to complain about their suffering, requesting rent reduction or rent exemption, and their pleas are sincere and cannot be ignored. Therefore, the association has resolved that Hongkou District has been most severely affected by the economic downturn. Under these extraordinary circumstances, the Municipal Council should exempt winter house rent to alleviate the burden on tenants, to show compassion in the face of hardship. We hereby submit this request, hoping that you will consider the difficult times and approve the exemption of winter house rent in Hongkou District, to alleviate the hardship and show compassion."</p>

<p>Tao Zhirong, a Suzhou native and brother-in-law of the slide opera singer Zhang Yizhi, married Yin Shuhua, a woman from his hometown, in 1933. They lived harmoniously until August 6 of this year, when Yin suddenly left home. She sent a letter through a lawyer to Tao, claiming that she could not bear the abuse and requested a reasonable settlement. Tao ignored it and filed a lawsuit in the Special Second Court against Yin, requesting reconciliation for cohabitation. Yin could not be found. After posting a reward and advertising in the newspapers, someone informed him that Yin was living with Guo Shunlin, a young man from Changzhou, in Yili No. 15, Belle Road. Tao reported it to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives Jiang Guo and Yin and arrested them. They were sent to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court and prosecuted for adultery. As a result of the trial, Guo was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and Yin to two months of imprisonment, each suspended for two years. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The Police Affairs Department of the French Concession expressed dissatisfaction with the light sentence imposed on Guo and filed an appeal to the High Third Branch Court. The appeal has now been concluded, and the original judgment regarding Guo Shunlin's crime has been revoked. Guo Shunlin has been re-sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, suspended for three years. However, Tao's lawsuit against Yin for cohabitation has been mediated out of court, and the two parties have divorced. Tao has withdrawn the lawsuit. But Tao has suffered a reward and advertising loss of more than 140 yuan due to Guo's seduction and concealment of his wife, Yin Shuhua. Tao, represented by lawyer Wang Hengyi, filed a lawsuit against Guo in the Special Second Court for damages. There have been two court hearings, but the criminal appeal case has been put on hold. Now that the appeal case has been adjudicated, the civil case will proceed again.</p>

They had a love match since childhood. Although they were not yet married, the young couple had a close relationship and visited each other frequently. Recently, the girl, for some unknown reason, suddenly had a suicidal thought. Yesterday morning, she swallowed poison at home. After taking the poison, she still lay in bed. At 9 o'clock, her mother saw that she was still sleeping in bed and called her without response. She lifted the curtain and saw that the girl's face had turned pale and she could not speak. She also saw traces of raw opium on the girl's fingers and corners of her mouth, and realized that she had taken poison. She immediately hired a car and rushed her to the hospital for emergency treatment. According to the doctor, because the poisoning was too deep, there was little hope of survival.</p>

<p>Ye Qinghua, the younger brother of the fugitive international drug trafficker Ye Qinghe from Fujian, was recently sued by Wu Yu, a woman from the same hometown, through a lawyer in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court for seduction and abandonment. The court ordered Wu to summon the defendant. Ye also incited his wife Yang Zhuxia, that is, Yang Laixiang, and his girlfriend Chen Rong, and others to beat Wu, causing injuries. Wu also sued Qing Ye Hua Yang Zhuxia Chen Rong for the crime of injury. Judge Sun Pengxian merged the two cases for trial several times. Because the third defendant Chen Rong was not present, the court ordered an adjournment and ordered the plaintiff to summon the defendant to court for questioning. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Because the bailiff did not know the address of the plaintiff Wu Yu, Wu was not summoned. The court was reconvened the day before yesterday, but Chen Rong and the witness Xi Xijun did not arrive, because they had not been summoned. After a brief questioning in court, the case was adjourned to the afternoon of the 16th for further hearing, and the plaintiff was ordered to report to the court on Monday (today) and wait for the bailiff to go with her to summon Chen Rong, and then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Jin Bukui from Yancheng, lives in a thatched shed without a number at the south end of the Bingchang Tian in Pudong. He is now a foreman at the Yongtai Wharf in Lujiazui. His first wife died and left a son, Rongshan, 17 years old, who is also a worker at the wharf. Last October, he married Nian Qiao, the daughter of Xia Yutian from Shanyang, through a matchmaker. She was only 16 years old at the time. The young couple had no love for each other, and Jin's stepmother, Chen, was extremely fierce and regarded Nian Qiao as a thorn in her side. At 11 AM the day before yesterday, Chen quarreled with her again over a trivial matter. Nian Qiao was so angry that she pretended to go to the room to remove the bed curtains for washing. After a while, there was still no movement. Chen went into the room to check and saw Nian Qiao hanging herself on the bamboo beam. She had already died. At this time, Jin and his son also returned home from work and were shocked to see the scene. They immediately sent someone to notify the dead woman's family. Jin, fearing that he would be convicted, went to the Pudong Sub-Bureau and falsely reported that she had died of illness. The bureau officers noticed his panicked expression and became suspicious. They immediately sent police to investigate and learned the truth. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation for falsely reporting a murder case, and Nian Qiao's mother's family also went to ask for justice, believing that she had been forced to commit suicide. Jin was interrogated by the sub-bureau and found to be innocent. That night, he was released on bail. Jin then asked relatives and friends to persuade his in-laws, promising to give the dead woman a generous funeral and ordering Rongshan (that is, the dead woman's husband) to act as a filial son and personally attend the funeral. Only then was the other party satisfied. Yesterday morning, the sub-bureau ordered Dibao Lu Shunlong to report to the court for inspection. At the same time, the father of the deceased, Yutian, also petitioned the court for exemption from inspection. The court approved it. At the time of the funeral that afternoon, the husband wore mourning clothes and behaved as if he had lost his parents. The onlookers were amazed.</p>

<h3 id="e154">New Pharmaceutical Industry Federation Requests Exemption from Inspection of Imported Medicines <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating that it was petitioning for the removal of the "medicines" category from the list of items subject to inspection for imported goods, in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. It stated that the government, in order to prevent the import of smuggled goods and maintain national tax revenue, had promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Inspection of Imported Goods Transportation and Sales" and specified the types of goods subject to inspection. Initially, there were twenty-six categories, none of which included medicines. Later, when the revised list of imported goods subject to inspection was promulgated, medicines were added. Consequently, the goods of our new pharmaceutical industry are also subject to inspection. However, the term "medicines" encompasses both Chinese and Western medicines. Considering only Western medicines, there are statistically no fewer than sixty to seventy thousand types. The Ministry has not clearly indicated which types should be inspected, causing all businesses, whether manufacturing or selling, to apply for licenses according to regulations. The procedures are cumbersome and often time-consuming. Medicines are essential for medical treatment and are vital to human life. If urgently needed medicines are delayed due to licensing procedures, it is indirectly harmful to society. Except for domestically produced Western medicines, 99% come from Europe and America. Now, both goods manufactured by Chinese merchants and those entirely produced in Europe and America, which have no possibility of being smuggled, are being inspected uniformly. This is unfairly impacting innocent parties. Therefore, according to the resolution of the first national member representative conference of the affiliated association, we respectfully submit this petition to the Ministry, hoping that you will consider the people's hardships and grant permission to remove the "medicines" category from the list of imported goods subject to inspection, and order its implementation to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. This would be a great act of kindness.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Observations on the Future of the Pound Sterling <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Yuchi</p>
<p>Since the devaluation of the French franc, the monetary agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and the gold export agreement between the three countries, the world monetary war seems to have come to a halt. What impact will these two new monetary agreements have on the future of the pound sterling? At the same time, what policies will the UK's Exchange Equalisation Account adopt to adjust exchange rates? These are the current urgent issues for British currency that need to be resolved. If the contents of the three-nation currency agreement do not stipulate the premium between London and New York, it can be said to be meaningless; in other words, the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar must have a limited regulation. If the price of gold calculated in pounds fluctuates without limit, the United States will certainly not participate in the agreement. Assuming that the above two currency agreements will stipulate the limits of the pound-dollar exchange rate, it is necessary to describe the past environment and policies of British currency when reviewing the future of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Since 1931, the elements that determine the pound exchange rate are not only the UK's trade balance and international balance of payments, but also the total trade balance between the sterling area and other countries in the world. Because London has regained its world financial hegemony in the past five years and has become the center of international lending and the hub of financial regulation and clearing for sterling area countries. This factual formation is due in part to the stability of the pound price; in part to the need for countries in the sterling area to maintain liquidity in the London market for allocation. The countries in the sterling area ship goods to London quarterly and use the proceeds from the sale of goods to store in London, so the liquidity in London is increasing daily. However, countries in the sterling area are also likely to export gold and liquidity stored in London due to the payment of goods imported from other countries and for other reasons, which will affect the rise and fall of the pound exchange rate.</p>
<p>For example, in 1935, the United Kingdom owed foreign countries approximately £205 million, which is only the figure for the merchandise import surplus; in addition, it owed sterling area countries a total of £73 million; at the same time, in 1935, the United Kingdom had intangible exports to sterling area countries totaling £150 million. Balancing the two, the United Kingdom actually held a claim of £80 million. Countries in the sterling area can offset part of the UK's import surplus by shipping goods overseas and receiving payment for them. Therefore, the invisible export item in the UK's international trade plays an important role and can also have a serious impact on the rise and fall of the pound exchange rate. Under the shadow of the recession in the past few years, non-commodity items in the UK's international balance of payments, such as gold flows, capital movements, and freight, have been undergoing obvious changes year by year and have gradually become important. This evolution of facts can often have a powerful impact on the pound sterling, whether the movement of gold and capital occurs within the sterling area or between the sterling area and other countries, it has the same impact on the pound sterling, but the results are different. Last year, the surge in prices, the moderate recovery of world trade, the recovery of shipping, and the abnormal development of international speculative funds pouring into Wall Street in the United States were all sufficient to influence the rise and fall of the pound price, making the work of the UK's Exchange Equalisation Account increasingly complex and difficult.</p>
<p>Today, the work of the UK's Exchange Equalisation Account is even more difficult. Because London's foreign lending is prohibited, and the British authorities are actively promoting a cheap money policy, the steps to maintain the pound exchange rate are far less simple than in the past. The war clouds are spreading in Europe, and the international situation is becoming increasingly tense. The production of British steel and machinery is insufficient for application, and it has to be imported from foreign countries, so the figures for merchandise import surplus are expanding daily. The figures for this year's import surplus have already exceeded £55 million compared to the same period last year. However, as far as the UK itself is concerned, there is no major danger. Because the UK's international balance of payments last year had a credit balance of £40 million; and the UK's overseas loans are due for repayment every year. In 1933, the most recessionary year, the inflow of British overseas funds was estimated to be as high as £67 million. The figures for this year are also around £80 million. The result of the inflow of funds has had a good impact on the pound sterling, and London's liquidity has been quite active. The inflow of funds has always been listed as a non-commodity item and is a kind of intangible income.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the British authorities should pay close attention to this item of intangible income. There are many sources of this income, and the threads are complicated, including interest on overseas investment, freight, and miscellaneous labor services. The interest on overseas investment was estimated at approximately £160 million in 1934, and the figure estimated by the Ministry of Commerce in 1935 was also £170 million. Freight was estimated at approximately £70 million in 1935. Other miscellaneous income, such as the sale of ships, government transactions, etc., is also between £40 million and £50 million. Therefore, the UK's intangible income occupies an important position in the international balance of payments due to the large amount, which cannot be denied. And it is also an iron fact that it can indirectly affect the future of the pound sterling. Recently, due to the devaluation of various countries' currencies, the softening of import quota systems, and the removal of tariff barriers, the economic situation of various countries seems to be showing signs of prosperity; then the interest income of British overseas investment may be able to increase from £170 million in 1935 to the pre-panic level of £300 million, which is obviously very beneficial to the situation of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>In the current situation, if the UK does not find a way to increase trade with non-sterling area countries, then the future of the pound sterling has two major potential dangers: the first is that British funds may flow out due to the attraction of the New York Stock Exchange in the United States; the second is the increase in merchandise import surplus. In the past, gold standard countries, because of the occurrence of domestic panic, the funds stored in London are now gradually flowing out and returning, which is insignificant and can be handled and dealt with easily by the UK's Exchange Equalisation Account. The funds flowing to Wall Street can also be easily stopped through strict adjustment and management. Only increasing the export of goods is indeed a difficult problem to solve. According to experts' estimates, this year's merchandise import surplus will exceed last year's by more than £75 million, and the actual excess figure may be even greater. The increase in overseas investment income is only about £10 million to £20 million; and the increase in freight income is only about £10 million to £15 million. The only remaining income that can offset the import surplus is capital movement. Capital movement is already an important factor determining the strength of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Based on the above description, the future of the pound sterling is very critical. If Wall Street can remain stable and no longer cause trouble in the near future, then the pound sterling should be able to return to stability within this year. However, the future of the United States in 1937, newly devalued countries, and the world commodity market is unknowable, so the good or bad of the future of the pound sterling cannot be determined in advance. However, it is already a clear and undeniable fact that the work of the UK's Exchange Equalisation Account will become more difficult.</p>
<p>Since the pound sterling joined the three-nation currency agreement and signed the gentlemen's agreement, the pound exchange rate should not have severe ups and downs in recent months. The exchange rate against the US dollar has recently been fluctuating around 4 shillings and 89 pence, which seems too high; if intangible income cannot have a substantial increase, then the US-UK exchange rate will have the opposite development. Therefore, it is best if the gold prices of various countries can obtain a reasonable export and import point. The United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries have already made regulations. If the United Kingdom can also stipulate a limit, and add tax cuts and cooperation of the exchange equalization fund, not only can the currencies of ____ countries step onto the road to prosperity, but the entire world monetary system can also lay a sound foundation.</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Review of Small-Amount Credit Loans from Banks <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tongsun</p>
<p>(I) An Outline of General Banking Operations</p>
<p>The establishment of banks is a product of modern social group living. They bear the responsibility of regulating finance, and their business revolves around the supply and demand of funds. However, we must understand that banks are a necessary component of a modern economic society. We must first briefly discuss the business operations of banks before discussing the small-amount credit loan business that this article intends to discuss.</p>
<p>Simply put, banks mainly engage in two major businesses: deposits and loans. Other businesses, such as remittances and trusts, the former is merely to regulate finance between two locations, helping the bank to achieve its mission. The latter is the bank relying on its own capabilities as a credit institution to serve customers.</p>
<p>(A) Deposits are the lifeblood of banks. In short, the reason why banks can regulate surplus funds is only because they can use deposits to lend to those who lack funds. There are five types of deposits:</p>
<p>(1) Current Deposits</p>
<p>1. Current deposits at commercial banks</p>
<p>2. Current deposits at savings banks</p>
<p>(2) Time Deposits</p>
<p>1. Compound interest deposits (i.e., lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal)</p>
<p>2. Installment deposits and lump-sum withdrawal</p>
<p>3. Lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal</p>
<p>4. Principal deposit with interest payments</p>
<p>(3) Notice Deposits</p>
<p>(4) Bill Deposits</p>
<p>(5) Temporary Deposits</p>
<p>Current deposits at banks do not actually generate any profit for the bank itself. They require sufficient reserves for immediate payment and involve complicated procedures. However, they offer great convenience to depositors. Merchants and companies, whose daily income is in silver, would inevitably face the risk of unforeseen circumstances if they kept it themselves. Therefore, once deposited in a bank as a current deposit, they do not need to bear the risk of safekeeping, payment is convenient, and they can also earn some interest. Why wouldn't they do it? For the banks themselves, since their mission is to regulate finance, they cannot complain about complicated procedures.</p>
<p>Then there are time deposits. Depositors in this area can generally be divided into the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Those who have funds but lack investment experience;</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary workers whose earnings are very small, so they save bit by bit in the hope of accumulating more.</p>
<p>Because this type of deposit does not require reserves, it can be fully utilized. Therefore, time deposits are the largest source of funds for banks.</p>
<p>Other deposits, such as bill deposits, notice deposits, and temporary deposits, are merely methods used by banks to attract funds!</p>
<p>(B) Loans – broadly speaking, there are three types of loans:</p>
<p>(1) Bill Discounting</p>
<p>(2) Mortgage Loans</p>
<p>1. Real estate mortgage loans</p>
<p>2. Chattel mortgage loans</p>
<p>(3) Credit Loans</p>
<p>1. Secured credit loans</p>
<p>2. Unsecured credit loans</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, banks absorb and concentrate funds from all parties and then distribute funds. Therefore, the lending business is a method of distributing funds.</p>
<p>The meaning of discounting is that the bank buys bills that have not yet matured. From the date of purchase to the maturity date, the interest to be deducted is calculated at the current market interest rate, and the cash is exchanged for the bill holder. There are five types of bills that ordinary banks discount:</p>
<p>(1) Bills issued by producers or manufacturers to wholesalers;</p>
<p>(2) Bills issued by wholesalers to retailers;</p>
<p>(3) Bills issued by consumers to retailers;</p>
<p>(4) Bank drafts, bills of exchange, and money shop drafts and bills of exchange.</p>
<p>The first, second, and third types of bills listed above are the commercial acceptance drafts and various import and export bills of exchange currently processed by banks; the fourth type of bill is the most common discounted bill on the market.</p>
<p>Discounted loans generally have very short terms, while longer-term loans are only mortgage loans and credit loans. Among mortgage loans, real estate mortgage loans have longer terms. These loans are mostly secured by factory foundations, land, houses, and equipment; chattel loans are mostly secured by commodities, government bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, gold and silver, etc. Secondly, regarding credit loans, one type is secured credit loans, and the other is unsecured credit loans. The formation of this type of loan had already reached its peak in our country during the era of money shops. For hundreds of years, the regulation of domestic agriculture and commerce in our country has relied entirely on credit loans from money shops. However, since the opening of maritime trade, foreign financial institutions have mainly focused on exchange and mortgage loans. In addition, in recent years, the global economic downturn has permeated China, and this type of credit loan has greatly diminished in importance.</p>
<p>(II) The Reasons and Methods for Banks to Establish Small-Amount Credit Loans</p>
<p>Banks are using all their ingenuity to attract business in order to absorb funds. They have established various savings deposit methods to absorb small amounts from individuals. Thus, on the one hand, banks have reached the middle and lower classes of the people in terms of concentrating funds. Even more grassroots banks send people to schools and factories to absorb the surplus savings of students and workers. However, when we observe banks distributing funds, we have not seen such widespread grassroots efforts. Especially in the current era of extreme economic panic in China, we only hear about banks tightening loans. What we usually see are only mortgage loans to a few large factories and large stores. As for general small factories and small businesses, they could originally rely on credit loans from money shops to survive, but what about now! The market is different, and the times have changed. The money shops themselves are experiencing difficulties. Where else can they get credit loans from? As a result, the market downturn is even worse, and commerce is declining. We only see stores closing down, and rarely see new ones opening. There is also a general public who rely solely on salaries or wages to make a living. They are also affected by the economic panic, and at the same time, the cost of living is increasing day by day. It is not easy for them to maintain their daily lives. If they occasionally encounter some unexpected accidents or have legitimate uses for money, they are helpless. Thus, they are subjected to usurious loans, high-interest rates, and various kinds of heavy exploitation. Everyone knows that they cannot fall into this trap, but when they are helpless, they have no choice but to bite the bullet and borrow. As a result, economic pressure increases day by day. When they reach the point where they can no longer cope, the strong take risks, and the suffering of the weak cannot be fully described. This situation is, of course, most developed and obvious in cities. Therefore, a small number of banks in Shanghai, in view of this situation, created small-amount credit loans to relieve the urgent needs of those who live on salaries and small factories and small businesses. This is the origin of small-amount credit loans.</p>
<p>Small-amount credit loans have actually been popular abroad for a long time. Even in the United States, many very ordinary banks offer millions in small-amount credit loans. It is not surprising. Many entrepreneurs also use small-amount credit loans to promote their products. We only need to look at the recent transactions of cars, radios, and bicycles, all of which have installment payment methods. This is a variation of small-amount credit loans. The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank's Jing'an Temple Road branch was the first bank in Shanghai to handle small-amount credit loans, opening in February 1930. Later, in April 1933, the Siming Savings Society and the Intermediate Credit Trust Company also opened and engaged in small-amount credit loan business. Later, the Xinhua Trust &amp; Savings Bank, the Nanshi Commercial Bank, the Yongda Bank, the Tongyi Trust Company (which has been liquidated), the Ningbo Industrial Bank, and many privately organized institutions all handled small-amount credit loans. To date, there are no fewer than a dozen such institutions.</p>
<p>Looking at the articles of association of the lending institutions, there are generally the following common points.</p>
<p>(1) Borrower Qualifications - Any citizen residing in Shanghai, over the age of 21, who has been employed in a company or store for six months or operating a business for more than one year, can enjoy this service.</p>
<p>(2) Loan Amount - Mostly from 50 yuan to 500 yuan, occasionally some from 100 yuan to 500 yuan or 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Interest - Interest rates are mostly between 6 and 9 percent per month, calculated daily, and deducted in advance when the loan is established.</p>
<p>(4) Loan Period - The maximum repayment period is one year, with equal monthly installments. For example, if you borrow 120 yuan, you must repay 10 yuan per month. Therefore, this type of repayment must be paid on a fixed date. If the end of the month is set as the repayment date, then it must be repaid at the end of the month without delay.</p>
<p>(5) Collateral - Most require two guarantors, whose qualifications are similar to those of the borrower. The guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the outstanding loan.</p>
<p>(6) Investigation Fee - When applying for a loan, the borrower must rely on the bank to investigate credit, so this investigation fee must also be borne by the borrower. The amount is usually 1% of the loan amount deducted when the loan is established, and some are pre-paid when applying for the loan.</p>
<p>(7) Overdue Repayment - As mentioned earlier, this type of loan must be repaid on a predetermined date. However, if the borrower fails to pay on time, the bank must charge a handling fee and overdue interest. The handling fee is at least 5 jiao and at most 1 yuan, and the overdue interest is calculated at 1 percent per month.</p>
<p>(8) Early Repayment - Borrowers can pay off all of their debts one day before the stipulated date and get a refund on part of the interest.</p>
<p>(9) Loan Procedures - The borrower first contacts the bank and must be questioned orally by the bank. If it is considered that the qualifications are still met, then a "loan application form" will be issued immediately. The borrower can then invite the guarantor to fill it out in detail and submit it to the bank for investigation. Then, the bank will directly notify whether the loan is approved or not. The general procedures are as described above.</p>
<p>(III) A Review of the Content of Small-Amount Credit Loans</p>
<p>Small-amount credit loans are based on the principle of installment repayment and secured by credit. Therefore, it is felt that the borrower has the following benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Credit Guarantee - In terms of the current situation in China, credit loans from money shops have been eliminated by the times. Credit loans from ordinary banks are only available to a small number of reputable and well-established stores. Therefore, it is not possible for individuals or small businesses to enjoy this preferential treatment. Now, as long as there are two guarantors, they can enjoy this right. This is tantamount to improving the economic status and credit of the people.</p>
<p>(2) Installment Payment - This type of loan uses the method of installment repayment. On the borrower's side, they only need to repay a fraction of the loan amount each month, and naturally, they will pay off the entire loan without realizing it.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivate a Habit of Honesty - These loans all stipulate that payments must be made every day or can be delayed for a few days. If the payment is made after the set date, a penalty (handling fee) must be paid. Therefore, the borrower must repay on time, which subtly cultivates the borrower's habit of honesty.</p>
<p>(4) Develop a Habit of Saving - According to the method of installment repayment, the borrower repays the debt without realizing it. Then, in the future, they can finally accumulate small amounts of savings every month to prepare for future emergencies. Isn't this cultivating a habit of saving!</p>
<p>Then, the bank also has the following benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Capital Flow - The thing that stores and banks fear the most is the inability of capital to flow. Banks are institutions that regulate finance. They should naturally pay more attention to the flow of capital. In the past, we often saw banks going bankrupt and banks being liquidated. In fact, they were not all overly indebted, and the inability of capital to flow was a major reason. Therefore, banks have recently been doing less real estate mortgage loans, which is also a significant example. However, this type of small-amount credit loan is suitable for the bank's appetite. They lend out funds and receive them back every month. Therefore, they can lend and collect at any time. This kind of continuous flow can expand business and circulate funds.</p>
<p>(2) Generous Interest - Looking at the current lending institutions, the interest rate on the surface is only 6 to 9 percent per month, but in reality, it is more than 15 percent per month (the calculation method is detailed later). The highest interest rate for ordinary loans is only about 10 percent, so a large amount of interest can be obtained from small-amount credit loans.</p>
<p>(3) Solid Creditor's Rights -</p>
<p>1. For this type of loan, at least two guarantors are required, and they must be jointly and severally liable with the borrower. Therefore, even if something happens to one of the three, it is not difficult to find someone to compensate among the other two.</p>
<p>2. This type of loan mostly stipulates a "penalty fee." This means that if the borrower fails to repay in the future, the borrower should bear the losses suffered by the bank in recovering the debt. The penalty fee is calculated at 20% of the loan amount.</p>
<p>3. Short Period - Generally, the repayment period for small loans now is mostly no more than one year, so the time is also shorter than other loans.</p>
<p>The above is said in general. If we further explore the methods, there are also places that can be studied.</p>
<p>(1) Interest Rate is Too High - Although the current interest rate for credit loans is between 6 and 9 percent per month, if you calculate it in detail, you feel that the interest rate for loans is too high. Now, let's give an example to illustrate:</p>
<p>Suppose you borrow 100 yuan from the same bank, and the interest rate is calculated at 7.5 percent per month on a daily basis. Then, the interest to be deducted for one year (365 days) is 9 yuan and 1 jiao and 3 fen, so the bank actually lends out only 90 yuan, 8 jiao, and 7 fen (100 - 9.13 = 90.87). At the end of the first month, the borrower repays 8 yuan and 3 jiao and 3 fen, so at the end of the first month, the principal lent out by the bank is only 82 yuan and 5 jiao and 4 fen (90.87 - 8.33 = 82.54). Extrapolating this way, we list the table as follows:</p>
<p>Time Bank's Principal Loan Amount</p>
<p>Initial loan of 100 yuan (deducting interest) 90.87</p>
<p>End of the first month 82.54 End of the second month 74.21 End of the third month 65.88</p>
<p>End of the fourth month 57.55 End of the fifth month 49.22 End of the sixth month 40.89</p>
<p>End of the seventh month 32.56 End of the eighth month 24.33 End of the ninth month 15.90 End of the tenth month 7.57</p>
<p>End of the eleventh month (reduced by 0.76)</p>
<p>Suppose we average the bank's principal loan amount</p>
<p>So we calculate several interest rates and get the following table, all based on a loan of 100 yuan with a term of 12 months as the calculation standard</p>
<p>(2) Interest Deducted in Advance - According to ordinary loans, except for the discount interest, the interest is mostly returned together with the outstanding loan. However, the interest on this small loan must also be deducted first. There is no reason for this on the bank's side. Therefore, those who do not understand the truth even say it is exploitation and extortion. However, looking at the current interest rate, it seems to be lighter than the interest rate of usurious loans on the market. If the interest rate can be further reduced, and the interest receivable is repaid in installments along with the principal, it seems more reasonable, which is lighter for the borrower and still does not cause any loss to the bank.</p>
<p>(3) Repayment Period is Too Short - The term for small-amount credit loans is mostly one year. If a person with a monthly salary of about 100 yuan borrows 300 yuan, then they must repay 25 yuan each time. Therefore, they must use a quarter of their salary each month to repay the loan, which will definitely make it difficult to cope with their personal or family life. As a result, they borrow here and there, and their debts become deeper and deeper. Therefore, if the loan term can be extended to one and a half or two years, the borrower's monthly burden will be reduced, and it will be easier to cope with.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>The above discussion is only a discussion of the principles and methods of small-amount credit loans. Although we have raised points that should be improved, in general, small-amount credit loans have made no small contribution to promoting the virtue of honesty and cultivating the habit of saving. Moreover, this type of loan is easy to popularize among the general middle and lower classes of the people. Therefore, the bank itself can indeed show its ability to regulate finance and serve society, while the citizens can truly get a savior from the economic panic.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Securities The Bond Market Fluctuated Greatly in a Week Market Sentiment Turned from Weak to Strong <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the government bond market fluctuated drastically, and the trend turned from weak to strong. Because market sentiment has become calmer due to the situation, most retail investors feel optimistic, so absorption is very smooth. In addition, many large investors have risen to support, and the market price has gathered to become popular, rising quite strongly. However, because the rise was too strong, it attracted the attention of those holding physical goods. A giant in the financial world suddenly sold at a limited price with unlimited chips. According to rumors, it was physical goods. The progress of the market situation was immediately hit and moved downstream. However, the retail market atmosphere is still very strong and fearless. The absorption capacity has increased instead, causing the market price to rise again after setbacks. However, the multi-party and empty-party camps have stood opposite each other, and the momentum of both sides is very strong. There are still many changes in the future. However, in the end, sudden and extremely bad changes in environmental news will cause drastic changes in the bond market. There is a risk of a sharp drop today. It is hoped that speculators will be cautious. The whole week's experience: on Monday, the market situation continued to tend to a sideways state. Large investors were extremely lacking in entering and exiting. Only retail transactions embellished the table. The market price only rose and fell by a few cents. On Tuesday, because the Qingdao incident was resolved, people's hearts turned high. Large investors such as 50, 16, and 35 all absorbed enthusiastically. The market price rose steadily from 4:00 p.m. to 45 cents and 9 cents. On Wednesday, the trend changed quite drastically. Initially, the market atmosphere was strong, and the buying sentiment of retail investors and large investors such as 25, 52, and 13 was even stronger. The market price rose consistently. However, in the late market, a certain large investor in the financial world suddenly entrusted a large amount to 47, 20, and other large sales. The market situation turned back to weak. On Thursday, because a certain financial tycoon confessed that the chips had not been sold out, he again entrusted 43, 43, and 37 and other large investors to sell, and the amount was unlimited, and the price was limited. The market situation uniformly fell weakly, but the retail bulls were still extremely firm, and their appetite was also strong, so the decline was turned to be eased. On Friday, the trend turned back to stop rising. The number of sales from a certain large investor in the previous sale has decreased, and the purchases of retail investors and 35, 4, and 11 are still strong. The market price rose again by 5 cents to 45 cents. On Saturday, the market situation was quite swirling. Initially, it rose due to the closing of 4, 11, 77, and other large investors, and then turned back to fall due to the sales of 54, 35, and 10. As a result of the whole week, it rose consistently by 1 jiao to 4 jiao, and type A rose by 1 yuan alone. The total number of transactions was 4,761,500 yuan. The comparison of the highs and lows is listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan) It rose at the close due to the replenishment of short positions</p>
<h3 id="e168">Cotton Yarn U.S. Cotton Industry Seems to Be Waiting for New Developments The Market Price Rose at the Close Due to the Replenishment of Short Positions <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, and each month rose from being unchanged to 4 pounds. Liverpool news was good, bulls closed out, local help and New Orleans sold out, but did not rise. Domestic and foreign peers are still the largest buyers, but demand has decreased, and some peers are waiting for new releases. The current demand is stagnant and strong, the cloth market is quiet and stable, and the market price rose at the close due to short covering and Liverpool purchases. The spot price rose by 11 pounds, and the futures price rose by 7 to 18 pounds. English cotton spot fell by 1 point, and futures rose by 23 points. Indian cotton rose after short covering and encountered hedging sales due to speculators buying. The Pingguo rose by 0.25 to fell by 0.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bairo Creek rose by 0.5 rupees. The original telegram recorded left (telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening price on the 14th was expected to be Bairo for 224 rupees, Aomula for 204 rupees and 25 cents, and Pingguo for 165 rupees and a half, all up half a rupee.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly reduced, with only about 100 shipments arriving. Of these, the actual quantity of goods was just over two-thirds. Among them, thin paddy rice accounted for over sixty shipments. Although there were ongoing orders for over ten thousand packages of thin paddy rice from Qingpu, Yantai, and other regions, the demand was particularly weak. However, due to the relationship with the current national situation, people were anxious, leading to a sluggish market and difficulty in maintaining prices. As a result, the market price continued to decline by two "chi" [unit of length]. Sales of thick japonica rice on this street were already stagnant, and although Tianjin merchants initially considered purchasing, they ultimately ceased due to small telegram orders from Tianjin, causing prices to plummet by more than two "jiao" [unit of currency]. The price of Du Yang pointed rice also fell by one or two "jiao," while Yin Yuan rice showed signs of fatigue, dropping by a "jiao." Looking back at the overall situation, the trend seems difficult to predict. However, to present a favorable outlook would probably be difficult.</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight shipments from various river regions. The sales of various goods on the market were slow. Market price of white japonica fell by about a small "jiao." Due to the suspension of orders for thin paddy rice, the price dropped by two or three "jiao." Early rice price followed with a small "jiao" decline. The price of Yang Du pointed rice showed signs of fatigue, falling by three or four "fen" [unit of currency]. White Yuan was stable.

<p>This world is cruel; it is filled with darkness, bloodshed, and contradictions.</p>
<p>The strong can oppress the weak, sucking their blood and eating their flesh.</p>
<p>In big cities, some people sell their blood for a living, forced to relinquish the most precious thing they possess, that which sustains their life, for the enjoyment of the wealthy.</p>
<p>On the front lines, a strong nation can aid bandits in attacking a weak nation, arbitrarily bombing others with planes and bombs, yet forbids retaliation, because that would insult them.</p>
<p>In the international arena, a strong nation can even use force to conquer a weak nation, seizing its land and property, and not only can the aggressor proclaim this as spreading civilization and propagating benevolent rule, but even strong nations can exchange recognition of this as "truth," and even form alliances to "re-invade."</p>
<p>Are we, the weak, destined to perpetually submit, with no chance of redemption?</p>
<h3 id="e172">Eulogy for Sun Yat-sen by You Lie <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Da</p>
<p>Revolutionary veteran Mr. You Lie passed away shortly after arriving in Beijing, to the sorrow of all who heard of it. During his lifetime, Mr. You, along with President Sun and Chen Shaobai and Yang Heling, advocated for revolution, earning them the title of the "Four Great Bandits." With the passing of President Sun, Chen, and Yang, Mr. You became the spiritual light of the revolutionary elders. When Mr. You came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he resided in the home of his friend Mr. Tan Haiqiu. I visited him several times, and due to the hardships of the journey at over seventy years of age, his spirit was quite weakened, causing all who saw him to worry. Later, after his health improved somewhat, he felt a deep longing for President Sun and urgently wished to visit his mausoleum in Beijing. Thus, on the night of September 23rd, accompanied by his secretary and entourage, he departed for the capital. That evening, few knew of his departure, and only I and Mr. Tan Haiqiu, among a few others, went to the station to see him off. At parting, Mr. You shook our hands warmly, saying he looked forward to seeing us again, never imagining that this would be our final farewell, a truly tragic event. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. You, on the 26th, along with Legislative Yuan member Feng Ziyou and others, held a memorial ceremony at the mausoleum. The text of the eulogy seems not yet to have appeared in the newspapers, so I am specially recording it here for the readers of our newspaper. This eulogy reflects on old friends and mourns his own life, filled with deep sorrow and emotion, leaving the reader breathless. It is no wonder that Mr. You, having read less than half, was overcome with grief, his voice choked with tears, unable to continue. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>On this twenty-sixth day of September, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, I, You Lie, respectfully offer fine flowers to pay homage to the spirit of my brother, Sun Yat-sen, the President: In the past, you led Chen and Yang, and also myself; advocating for revolution, we shared joyful mornings and evenings; with shared ambitions, our hearts were filled with passion, promoting and propagating, seeking to unveil great righteousness; the initial events in Guangzhou, secret plans were leaked; traveling overseas, enduring hardships and taking bitter medicine; persevering and striving again and again, unyielding as iron; men of high ideals followed like the wind, shedding much blood, dyeing the Republic, overthrowing the Qing dynasty; your accomplishments, who dares to steal; upholding the law and raising armies, establishing a government in Southern Yue; invited to participate in great plans, facing slander and chewing; only one meeting, becoming a permanent farewell. The burial mound is enshrined, regretting not being present at the burial; weeping and wailing, a close friend's string is broken; alas, how painful! Heling and Shaobai, one after another collapsing; looking at this one body, a lonely and desolate shape; especially encountering national hardship, increasingly severe; having seen so much suffering, my spirit is filled with sorrow; the purple gold smokes, the pine and cypress are covered in snow; coming now to mourn you, how can I bear this grief; offering flowers and pouring wine, may you enjoy this fragrance and purity; may you partake!</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Standard Cuckoo Clock <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>The "standard cuckoo clock" I am referring to here is not the standard time clock at the Jianghai Customs House by the Huangpu River, which reports the time every day, but a completely authentic, old-brand "goody-goody" teacher in the countryside. His surname was Hu, and his given name was Cheng. It is said that the origin of this elegant nickname was not accidental. Because when he was teaching, he didn't wear a watch. After a certain amount of time had passed, he didn't need to peek at the clock, nor did he need the school servant to ring the bell. He would, without being early or late, precisely and appropriately call the class leader to announce the end of class; therefore, the teachers in other grades, as long as they saw him stepping out of the classroom door, would also end their classes, without a second's difference. He was truly as accurate as could be.</p>
<p>He liked to drink alcohol and take snuff. His nose was always smeared black. Besides teaching, he also served as a local security chief. Once, he had a disagreement with the district chief. The district chief secretly pried off the plaque at his door that read "×th Bao (neighborhood unit) Security Chief's Office," intending to remove him from his post. It was very comical! At the time, he pretended not to know anything and went to the Public Security Bureau to report that the security chief's plaque had been stolen, causing a laughing matter. So people also called him the "plaque-prying security chief."</p>
<p>He was very honest and consistent in his work. However, because he was too consistent, he almost broke his rice bowl! I remember one autumn when school superintendents from various counties in the province were inspecting each other's schools, one superintendent arrived in the village on a Sunday, which was normally a day off from school. Unexpectedly, the superintendent had a strange idea and insisted that he gather the students at the school to give a class for him to see, saving him from having to come back and forth. At the time, he firmly refused! He just sat in the teahouse, drinking wine and listening to the superintendent. Who knew that in less than two months, the education bureau's "××××" order arrived. In fact, having classes on Sundays was something unheard of before the Song Dynasty!</p>

<h3 id="e175">Winter Goldfish <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>For goldfish raised delicately, one must pay attention to how they are cared for in the winter. Otherwise, goldfish are very susceptible to the problem of loosening scales due to stimulation from the cold. Or the fish's body develops spots, gradually festering, like people suffering from frostbite. To avoid this kind of problem, one must provide winter protection. The method for winter protection is to bury the fishbowl halfway in the soil, and cover the surface of the bowl with a thick reed mat at night to avoid frost and snow. The four sides of the bowl should be surrounded with rice straw. At this time, the fish has entered a semi-dormant state, and its appetite has sharply decreased. Even if you don't feed it, it won't starve to death. If it has already caught a cold, then quickly move it to the sunlight so that it receives a good amount of heat, or illuminating it with an electric lamp is also very beneficial.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met with Mr. Han Jiyin, who is a goldfish expert. His special garden is located west of the Shanghai South City Xietu Road Public Security Bureau gate, occupying several acres, with dozens of fishbowls. It is called "Fei Garden." I had the opportunity to visit it once in the summer. There are many famous varieties, truly rare specimens. This time, when I met him, I asked, "How are the fish in Fei Garden doing?" He said, "Taking care of goldfish in the winter is very troublesome. The fish that come from the north can still withstand the cold. Fish like the pearlscale goldfish come from the south and will freeze to death if they get a little cold." So every day near noon, he must scoop out the water from the fishbowl, making it very shallow, so that the sunlight can be more effective. In the afternoon, he gradually fills the water up again, so that when it freezes at night, only a layer of ice forms on the surface, and the fish hibernates below, not affected at all. Removing the ice the next morning is also very easy. In winter, the water doesn't easily become dirty, so it's not necessary to change it often. If you do change it, the new water must be slightly warmer than the old water, otherwise the fish will also get sick. He spares no effort in collecting rare varieties. Recently, he has added "blue telescope eye goldfish," "blue dragon egg goldfish," "blue lionhead goldfish," and "calico lionhead goldfish." A friend from the north has "violet pompom goldfish," which he envied terribly. He asked the friend to sell it to him, but the friend couldn't bear to part with it. He knew that the friend was addicted to painting, so he sent him a Pan Yisheng painting of a beautiful woman from his collection. The friend then gave him some "violet pompom goldfish" as a reward. Now they are being raised in Fei Garden. Every Saturday and Sunday, he is sure to be in the garden, receiving goldfish enthusiasts, and he invited me to come and appreciate them again, saying that the host of the Violet Society would certainly like the "violet pompom goldfish," and it would be especially welcome if I could come with him.</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Tragic News Startles Like a Flower Falling into Filth, Frequent Visits Leave the Heart Like Floss Soaked in Mud</p>
<p>Guoqi said: "I said long ago that you were very generous. Of course, this is your chivalrous spirit, but..." He drew out his words, preparing to say something more tactful. He couldn't think of that sentence for a moment, so he looked at the sliver of sunlight visible through the curtain and the window. Youmei said: "But Cousin didn't expect him to have such a background, right? I originally didn't want to tell you this, but Menglan thought it wasn't appropriate to put this matter in writing, and he didn't want to deceive anyone, so he indicated to me, asking me to tell you. I thought it would be good to tell Cousin. This proves that we have a relationship of righteousness. Moreover, you'll understand how to comfort such a literary confidant." Guoqi smiled slightly for no reason and sighed again. Youmei said: "As for that ring, it was entirely my idea. I thought that correspondence relying entirely on the mail was too inappropriate. I was willing to come out and pass on news between the two sides. But to allow me to send messages between the two sides, there must be something to bring to you that can prove it. Naturally, I am a relative on one side and the best classmate on the other. I also hope that the friendship between the two of you will be even stronger. What are Cousin's thoughts?" Guoqi said: "I wrote to Miss Jiang first. Although I can't help her with anything, I can't increase her pain. I originally prepared a little something to respond to her. So it seems I don't need to send it." Youmei said: "Why? Is Cousin very upset after receiving this news?" Guoqi said: "In his writing, I knew long ago that she was an unfortunate woman, so we got along through literary righteousness. Since that's the case, being unhappy after receiving this news is just feeling sorry for him. It's definitely not because I myself am unhappy. The reason I wanted to send something to him was to give him a memento, but now I feel that he doesn't need a memento." As the conversation reached this point, the atmosphere felt very tense, but Guoqi's behavior was very leisurely. He took out a fan with a Xiangfei bamboo handle from the desk drawer, opened it, and slowly fanned himself in front of his chest. Although that fan was something he often used, he looked at the calligraphy and painting on the fan as if he were seeing it for the first time. He waved the fan a few times and then held the fan up to look at it. Although there was a look of panic on his face, he used the act of looking at the fan to cover up this panic. Youmei sat diagonally across from him, also taking a handkerchief tucked into the buttonhole under her arm and folding it smoothly on her lap. Her apple-like cheeks also took on an extra layer of red. She lowered her eyelids. She suddenly smiled and said: "What I'm saying seems meddlesome. But Miss Jiang asked me to tell Cousin about her background, so I had to say it." (109)</p>
<h3 id="e178">Transgenderism (Part 1) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Ming</p>
<p>The matter of transgenderism truly occupies an extremely important and novel page in the history of modern medicine. If there weren't factual evidence, no one would believe that such a thing really happened, and they would definitely think it was a fabricated and baseless tale. Years ago, an elderly man from Tianjin announced that his granddaughter had suddenly turned into a boy, causing a sensation and spreading as a bizarre story, but its secret was immediately revealed. In reality, this old man was just trying to use this to swindle travel expenses. But in foreign countries, there have indeed been confirmed cases of transgenderism. Here are some stories of these transsexuals:</p>
<p>In Warsaw, Poland, there was a 24-year-old young man named Nochmen Tenenbaum. A few years ago, he joined the army and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was also awarded several medals for bravely saving lives. Gradually, he turned into a woman and fell in love with an artist. Recently, she entered the Warsaw obstetrics hospital and told the doctor that she was about to have a baby. Four days later, Miss Nochmen Tenenbaum indeed gave birth to a perfectly healthy nine-pound baby. The artist was very happy and said that he would marry her after she recovered.</p>
<p>Those who like sports will not forget Miss Zdenek Koubkova, a Czech female sprinter. She was the world record holder for the women's 800-meter race. After three surgeries, she became Mr. Zdenek Koubek.</p>
<p>Rambling Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e179">Thinking of the Patriotic Story of Donating Clothes to Soldiers from the Tang Palace Inspired by the Clothing Donation Movement <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Rushan</p>
<p>Seeing the proposal in this newspaper to donate over ten thousand woolen coats to support Sui, I feel that this is the most meaningful and effective way to support Sui. Donors don't feel it's a burden, and it meets the urgent needs of the soldiers. The procedures are also relatively universalized and rationalized. This is a suggestion that the Support Sui Association should adopt.</p>
<p>This clothing donation movement reminds me of a moving story from the Tang Dynasty when the nation's power was being extended. It shows that comforting soldiers resisting the enemy with warm clothing was already practiced in ancient times. The martial spirit of the Tang Dynasty represents the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation. The expansion of territory under alien rule during the Yuan and early Qing dynasties cannot be compared to the spirit of national self-respect of the Tang Dynasty. The crisis faced by the Han people in the Tang Dynasty after the Five Barbarians' Rebellion was similar to our country's present precarious situation. The spirit of national self-defense under external threats must have been very high. This can be seen in the Tang Dynasty's conscription system, where the entire nation was armed to defend the country. The bravery of Xue Rengui, Guo Ziyi, and others is still praised today in legends. What I want to mention is how the soldiers who fought bitterly in the northern frontier were treated. The main idea of the story is: the border guards' winter clothing was personally sewn by the palace ladies on the emperor's orders. One of the palace ladies, due to the loneliness of being confined to the palace for a long time and admiring the bravery of the border soldiers, couldn't help but write a love poem, which she slipped into the quilted coat for any soldier to wear, promising to become his wife in the next life. That was a kind of infatuation under impossible circumstances, but how could the soldier who found this poem dare to accept the coat? So he presented it to the imperial palace for the emperor to decide. As a result, the Tang emperor not only did not punish her, but instead betrothed the palace lady to the soldier as an encouragement. This story is not only a heartwarming tale created by the Tang emperor's joy, but in fact includes a very important meaning: first, how soldiers under the conscription system, especially those defending the border, were worshiped in the public's mind; second, why the soldiers' winter clothing was not purchased from the people, but had to be personally sewn by the palace ladies, which indicated the Tang emperor's generous treatment of the soldiers and encouraged the spirit of defending the country. As for the marriage, it was just an opportunity to show how the Tang emperor valued warriors and despised beauties from a national standpoint. We can imagine how moved the soldiers were at that time and how much more their patriotic spirit was inspired.</p>
<p>Now the Chinese nation is oppressed by foreign insults to a greater extent than in the Tang Dynasty. At this critical moment for national security, the people are the masters of the country. Shouldn't they care about the hard-fought spirit of the border guards? Therefore, in saving on expenses, food, and clothing, it can be said that it is a matter of course and duty to support the Sui army. At the same time, inspired by the above story, I believe that in addition to material assistance, the border guards also need spiritual encouragement. They don't have time to read newspapers and cannot directly feel the widespread sympathy of the people of the country. If we can donate 100,000 woolen coats (even if they are old), it will not only increase their ability to resist the cold in the trenches, but also make them feel directly that there are 100,000 people in the rear who are donating their clothes, and that they were woven by 100,000 women. Although they are not worth much money, they are all inner garments that everyone cherishes very much. They are actually being transferred thousands of miles to the border guards. Each garment carries infinite patriotic enthusiasm. This kind of spiritual moving power is greater than all assistance. I hope that the Support Sui Association will not neglect the spiritual effect of this clothing donation movement and adopt it carefully in addition to soliciting donations of money, so that it can be implemented quickly.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Daily News on Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>On the 9th, this newspaper translated and published a Japanese Shanghai Daily editorial on Sino-Japanese relations, criticizing the mistakes in Japan's self-proclaimed "China experts'" understanding of China. An important sentence read: "Can one expect results from looking down on one's opponent while trying to promote cooperation and friendship? ... The fact is, they are discussing China with the mindset of twenty or thirty years ago, which is no longer the case." In the past, Japanese political commentator Takashin Murobuse visited China and also published a paper on Sino-Japanese relations, arguing that the Japanese military's aggressive entry into China was a mistake, echoing our advocacy of resistance fifty years later, intending to use soft methods to make the Chinese people naturally accept their benevolent rule. This view was welcomed by some in our country who only seek immediate pleasure, unanimously praising Murobuse's remarks as "correct." Now, although the Shanghai Daily has not advised the Japanese military to use soft methods to make the Chinese people naturally accept their benevolent rule, the fact that it can criticize Japanese policy as a mistake at this time and place is enough to make us "feel flattered."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily points out that today's China is not the China of twenty or thirty years ago, a statement we believe to be correct. However, what it considers to be different is not necessarily what we consider to be different. For example, the fact that young Chinese people no longer smoke opium does not represent the distinguishing feature between today's China and the China of the past. For instance, in the past twenty or thirty years, the general Chinese populace has deeply learned from Japan's military force, especially since the September 18th Incident, this painful realization is too profound. Just this one instance of the entire nation, from top to bottom, near and far, unanimously and spontaneously assisting the Suiyuan anti-bandit campaign with the greatest enthusiasm, would never have happened in China twenty or thirty years ago. This is still a small beginning, and if expanded, the great force of the people hidden beneath the Chinese earth is inexhaustible. Perhaps precisely because of this, some more intelligent commentators from friendly countries have had to advise the Japanese military to be more careful about their steps. We are about to further expand this great force of the people, so that the invaders themselves realize that the path they are taking is a dead end!</p>
<p>However, the China experts from friendly countries also have some areas where they have not made mistakes. For example, using people like Zheng Xiaoxu and Yin Rugeng to indirectly rule China is the smartest method, which has been implemented and has achieved great results, and can be used forever. The Shanghai Daily did not point this out, and we are worthy to supplement this explanation here.</p>
<p>There is no need for the Chinese and Japanese people to hate each other. We know that the general Japanese public also sympathizes with our country being invaded. The major barrier between the two great nations is a small number of selfish people at the top of society. We welcome with the greatest respect enlightened intellectuals from friendly countries who strive to break through this barrier. However, in the past four or five years, in all newspapers and magazines of friendly countries (except for confidential ones), we have only seen writings that more or less promote aggression, or at most, remain silent. Where have the hopeful intellectuals of Japan gone?</p>

<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>February, the Bohai Sea thaws. Ice floes floating on the sea surface collide with each other in the howling north wind. The ship's whistle blares three sharp calls, and the ship weighs anchor.</p>
<p>The people clustered on the pier, their chaotic voices, as well as the distant vehicles, warehouses, and towering chimneys, all gradually recede into the distance. Enshrouded in the thin mist, the people on the shore look like ghosts, but the lights of dusk are like giant eyes filled with tears. Our ship slowly sets sail, heading towards Dalian.</p>
<p>At the bow, the sea waves roar, constantly splashing icy water droplets onto the deck. We all squat on the deck. Among them, several people with rolls of cotton batting under their arms and bundles on their backs are squatting near the iron railing, using a stubborn posture to resist the biting sea wind. The electric lights have not yet been turned on, and the deck is in darkness. The wind shelter flaps continuously in the wind.</p>
<p>I am the only person on the deck with a suitcase. In the crowd, people look at me with envious and surprised eyes. Near me, a farmer with a long, greasy pipe in his mouth constantly spews out pungent smoke at me. I occasionally glance at them, and every time he avoids my gaze. When I take out a cigarette and borrow a match from him, he asks me in a low voice with a "er" sound at the end of his sentences:</p>
<p>"Are you going to Guandong? You are..."</p>
<p>"No, I am going to Qingdao and will visit a friend in Dalian."</p>
<p>"You are studying in Beijing City? Eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes. There are fewer people going to Dalian this year, isn't that right?"</p>
<p>"No, there are many. Tens of thousands of people are going to Guandong. Guandong is a good place, a place for us to eat! But I heard that many people were driven away this year, and some have no news at all. I heard..." He leaned in and said softly, "Many people were killed, but none of us can stop it. We poor people, taking care of our mouths means we can't take care of our lives." As he spoke, his voice became extremely somber.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year..."</p>
<p>"Oh, fifty-eight. After fifty, there's not much time left! Living one day counts as one day. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"Do you need to run to Guandong to find work? I heard that Guandong has been very dangerous lately."</p>
<p>"That's right, you don't need to run to Guandong to find work. I look for work everywhere in Beijing City and Jinan Prefecture all year round, but is there any? Guandong is still the old place, a familiar road is better than a strange road. Dangerous? Sigh, there's no controlling so many things in the world now."</p>
<p>I am silent. Every word of the old man hits my heart. I raise my head. The ship has already sailed out of the harbor. Outside the railing is an infinite darkness. The mainmast standing firmly in the middle of the ship, its tip seems to be inserted into the dark clouds of the sky. The sea is rolling even more powerfully.</p>
<p>Most of the people around have fallen asleep, and some are even emitting a low snore. Some tremble constantly when they sleep, and the snore sounds like a patient's groan.</p>
<p>"You are wearing too little, it must be cold, right?" I ask.</p>
<p>"Yeah! A little. Tonight's sea wind is really strange, like it has thorns! Sigh. But, I've had enough of the cold. One winter, some of our brothers were working as miners in the Fushun pit, and it was freezing to death. It snowed heavily for three nights in a row, and the shed collapsed. Several brothers froze to death that time. I only remember being so frozen that I couldn't move, and I couldn't even shout for help, as if a ghost was covering my mouth with its hand. The next morning, the brothers in the same pit rescued us. Since then, I couldn't work anymore. Then I transferred to Harbin and worked in the White Russian factory for exactly three years. Until September 18th. Three years, exactly three years, when I left the factory, I didn't even have a penny! Sigh. The White Russians and the Yellow Russians are all the same ruthless, the brothers all said so." He sighed a long breath. "Many of the brothers who came out together are all gone now, it's really..." He lowered his head. We didn't say anything, and deathly silence occupied the entire deck.</p>
<p>The noise of the machines accompanied the northeast wind, howling wildly. We are all trembling.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the old man leaned forward, moved to my side, and said to me in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, you are a scholar, tell me, when can we have our day? Haven't we suffered enough from the Yellow Russians?" He looked at me with wide eyes, and I shivered all over.</p>
<p>On the deck and on the sea, there is still an endless darkness. In the far distance, the light of the lighthouse seems to appear and disappear as it searches.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Boxing <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Fei</p>
<p>A Friend's Letter</p>
<p>Friend: I am too excited. After watching the boxing match, as I dispersed with the crowd to the entrance, I realized that my hands were all sweaty, and my face was burning hot. When the wind blew, I didn't feel its cold, but it felt strangely good and comfortable.</p>
<p>Excitedly returning home, excitedly getting into bed, spending a lot of effort, and taking more than an hour, I finally fell asleep. But after falling asleep, I was awakened by my overly excited nerves. I had a dream.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I was also a boxer. My opponent was much taller and stronger than me. Therefore, I only had time to parry and no chance to counterattack. But even parrying, I couldn't parry. I was beaten with a face full of blood, but I still couldn't help but parry, because not parrying would lead to being beaten even more severely. The opponent would never stop attacking just because you were bleeding. I could only desperately parry, taking the opportunity to swing my small fist and strike at the opponent bravely. Although some strikes missed, sometimes I could hit him, and I was so happy to see blood flowing from his face that I laughed and woke up.</p>
<p>After waking up, I unconsciously touched my face. Was my face hot? Just like when I came out of the boxing match. Subconsciously, I looked at my hands to see if there was any blood? But there wasn't. I realized that I was just dreaming, and I was sleeping in a warm quilt. However, the shouts of the onlookers are still ringing in my ears, and those shouts were to encourage the strong to attack, not to sympathize with the weak. When one side suffered a heavy blow, the shouts rose from all around. They didn't favor one side, as long as you could beat the other side, the shout would be for you. This crazy-like shouting is ringing in my ears now, but I can't tell whether this is intimidating me or encouraging me?</p>
<p>It is midnight now, and there is probably still some time before dawn? The weather is very cold again. After writing these, I want to go back to sleep. Will I still have boxing dreams after sleeping? I don't know. Let me have them. I will gladly have them. I am not afraid of such dreams now. Even if I get beaten until my head is broken and bleeding again, I will continue to fight, because I understand the reason why I must continue to fight: not fighting will lead to being beaten even more.</p>
<p>That crazy shouting is ringing again. Now that I hear this sound, I feel it is a bit lovely. It is not a temptation, but it is a threat, and it can also be said that it is a warning.</p>
<p>It warns the weak that they must fight on!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Beacon Fire <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>——Remembering Badaling</p>
<p>When the train, like a snake, passed through three tunnels, the belt-like Juyongguan fell behind, and the train arrived at Qinglongqiao and stopped in the valley.</p>
<p>The wind and sand of the northern country are world-famous. When stepping on the gravel, running up the slope, crossing the stone steps, and climbing up the Great Wall, the wind and sand outside the Great Wall blow particularly hard, causing the traveler's clothes to make a rustling sound. The strong wind stirs up sand and dust, making the sky also hazy.</p>
<p>Walking on the Great Wall, stepping on the large stone bricks, many bricks on the city wall are incomplete. The Great Wall rises and falls like big waves. When a gust of wind and sand blows, the mountains seem to be in a mist.</p>
<p>Looking at the slope from the city, there is a village in the desolate, deep yellow sand.</p>
<p>When running up a watchtower, leaning against the gap, looking at the seemingly boundless outside the fort, the boundless, desolate desert unfolds. In the deep yellow sand, several shepherds are looking for food for their livestock. In a vast, desolate desert, several cargo merchants pace like shadows, leading groups of camels—the kings of the desert—with heavy bundles stacked on their humps, slowly shaking their heads, walking step by step towards the desert with swaying movements.</p>
<p>The winding Great Wall, undulating and lying on the top of the mountain, seems to extend deep into the hazy clouds. The lofty and solemn eight high mountain peaks stand like castles high in the sky. Many mountains surround it like sand dunes.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The mountains are covered with fine wild grass that undulates in the wind. When the wind and sand blow, a layer of gray sand covers the sky.</p>
<p>A traveler crossed the city bricks, struck a match, and with great difficulty avoided the wind, striking several matches before finally using the fire to light the overgrown wild grass. A wisp of light smoke floated up, and the faint fire spread. The light smoke slowly thickened, like an ancient beacon fire, and black smoke rose up, slowly rising even more. The black smoke, like the tongue of a snake, licked the sky...</p>
<p>This is something I will never forget. Whenever I think of the solemn Badaling, the beacon fire seems to appear before my eyes—I hope that the beacon fire will burn forever, that the black smoke can rush up to the sky, like a burning torch in the darkness, forever illuminating the earth.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Shentonya <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>"Shentonya" is a transliteration. Except that the character "ya" can be translated as "ya" (this "ya" does not mean house, but is a term for generally lower-class merchants, such as calling newspaper vendors "news ya," calling laundrymen "laundry ya," but also calling children "fang ya"...), the first two characters are quite difficult to find a name with the same meaning to replace them, because it is a special Japanese proper noun. I originally wanted to use the words "officially transmitted advertisement person," but China does not use that method to publicize advertisements, and there are many ways to promote them.</p>
<p>, what kind of guys are they after all?</p>
<p>I believe that people who go to Tokyo have seen this strange sight several times in at least one month, especially in prosperous areas. But I didn't know the name until I had been in Tokyo for more than a year. If I hadn't looked it up in the dictionary after reading a novel, or asked someone or heard someone tell it, I might not understand it even now.</p>
<p>The strange sight is this: a group of strangely shaped people (at least three or more), there are men and women in the crowd, but if you don't distinguish by sound, you might see men as women, and women as men. Because they (she) almost all wear the same strange clothes, and the foundation smeared on their faces is almost several times thicker than that of prostitutes, and they also use something jet black to draw their eyebrows extra thick and long. Some even put a few strokes somewhere on their faces, such as a mustache on their mouths. Although their tasks are the same, they are divided in cooperation. For example, some play cymbals, some blow pipes or trumpets, some beat drums, and some leave the team to hand out advertisements. The most important thing is the leader at the front who holds up something like an umbrella, on which is written in large, special characters an advertisement for either a discount or an opening. His steps seem to have taken a lot of effort to study. I'm sorry I can't describe it, but this impression still remains in my mind: those two feet tap very quickly, but they walk very slowly, and they step in an arc. His step movements are in harmony with the drum music, and the advertisement banner also moves left or right, or slightly rises or falls in harmony with his step movements. Once, I was walking on the street with Hideo Koizumi and happened to meet such a team. Koizumi admired that person's steps very much, and while staring at him, he repeatedly said:</p>
<p>"Very skilled, what good steps those are!"</p>
<p>I interrupted disapprovingly:</p>
<p>"What is that all about? If you play that, you might be even better than him."</p>
<p>"No, that's very difficult to learn!" He said seriously, as if he was sincerely admiring, and at the same time looked back at him again and again.</p>
<p>The individual actions of the people behind are different, but the steps are very consistent.</p>
<p>There are many ways to advertise, and they are improving day by day, for example, some use balloons, some use airplanes..., but this kind of Japanese "Shentonya" still exists, perhaps because it still retains a kind of charm to attract business. (Tokyo Miscellany)</p>

After that, he entered Sichuan and became the Shu Han. Actually formed a tripartite balance of power. Military advisor, Mr. Zhuge's plan. Persuading the officials to present a memorial. Because Cao Pi called himself emperor, he also became a ruler. Guan and Zhang were harmed, and Jingxiang was lost. Helplessly, the linked camps were burned by fire.

The Shu Han finally became the orthodox ruler. Respectfully supporting the small court of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>He Yunfang and He Qinfang "Double Pearl Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM Opening "Cai Wenji"</p>
<p>Highly talented and learned, beautiful in appearance. It is said that Wenji has her father's style. In her childhood, she could distinguish the strings on the zither. But he, accidentally overheard it from a distance. Not competing with the southern wind, she is truly intelligent. Just like Kuang, a master musician in the past. Zhonglang's daughter inherits the family's studies. Her peerless talent is like Cai Yong's. Unexpectedly, she drifted to the land of the barbarians in middle age. But she unexpectedly met Cao Cao. The wonderful thing is that she can decipher Cao Cao's hidden words. Her nephew is clear and meaningful. At that time, he did not hesitate to spend a thousand gold to redeem her. Only because he had the deepest friendship with her father in the same court. Only then was Wenji able to return to the Han country. To avoid lamenting her fate as a wanderer. But then again, she had already suffered the hardships of displacement. Not the same as ordinary ladies. Pitiable is the woman with both talent and beauty. But after all, she will have no support and no dependence in the end. In the beginning, she composed the Pipa music. Eighteen Hu Jia tunes are well-crafted. The finger sounds and techniques are exquisite. Spring rain, summer heat, autumn thoughts. Heavy snow in winter. The tune is desolate, and the rhythm is tragic. The lone swan that breaks its intestines on the flat sand knows it is not met with its soul mate.</p>

The scholar is so scared that he has no master. Chang'e should be in the Guanghan Palace, making a deep bow and asking in detail. My father is named Ma Rong. She is hiding in the embroidered courtyard named Yaocao. Needlework every year diligently. Wanting to dedicate treacherous power to the Liang Xiang Mansion. Determined to disobey the order.

<p>Actively Rehearsing Recently</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Amateur Dramatists performed Ibsen's "Nora" and Gogol's "The Government Inspector" last year, it can be said that they have "established" a very strong foundation in the Chinese drama world, setting off a huge wave in the lonely drama movement in recent years. The performance of "Nora" and "The Government Inspector" is also a rare harvest in the Chinese drama scene. At the beginning of 1936, they considered staging "Sai Jinhua," but due to various problems, they decided to postpone it temporarily.</p>
<p>It has recently been confirmed that the amateur dramatists have resolved to stage "The Power of Darkness" adapted from Tolstoy, "The Thunderstorm" by Ostrovsky, and "The Pig" adapted from the famous English drama (that is, O'Casey's "Juno and the Paycock"), three of the world's great plays, and have begun actively rehearsing on December 1, with a duration of forty days, and will hold a full rehearsal of the entire play starting on January 1.</p>
<p>The public performance will be in mid-January, scheduled for ten days, with each play performed for three days, and the first day will be a premiere.</p>
<h3 id="e189">"Street Angel" Begins Filming <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Following "Hearts United in Life and Death," Yuan Muzhi is currently engaged in his new work "Street Angel," which he wrote and directed. The script has already been approved by the central government and has begun filming at the Second Factory studio, actively rushing to complete it within the old calendar year.</p>
<p>All the technical staff of "Street Angel" are successors from "Hearts United in Life and Death," with no changes, photography by Wu Yinxi, scenery by Ma Shouhong, and sound by Lu Yinkeng.</p>

<p>Looking at the Hollywood child stars constantly appearing on the screen with their innocent and adorable performances, and then looking back at our own child stars, one can't help but sigh with a feeling of being far behind.</p>
<p>Child stars are often indispensable and important characters in a film's plot, and they also possess the magic to grasp the emotions of the audience. Naturally, this effect can only be achieved by child stars with talent and considerable training.</p>
<p>In the upcoming major production "Eternal Smile," starring Hu Die and directed by Wu Cun, there is a child star worth our attention: Wu Xiaozhu, the young daughter of director Wu Cun. In this play, her innocence, liveliness, and cleverness are fully displayed. Especially in several scenes where she appears with Hu Die, she is even more endearing. Hu Die said, "This is a promising star of the future!"</p>
<p>She is only ten years old this year and is studying in the fourth grade at Jingru Elementary School. Because of her intelligence, she consistently achieves excellent results in each term. When she was in the second grade at Xinya Elementary School, she won the speech championship, which shows how clever and articulate her little mouth is.</p>
<p>She has experience in performing stage plays. She also participated in the stage play "Crescent Moon," which Hu Die previously starred in.</p>

<p>After the success of Fang Peilin's "Sequel to Incarnation Girl," another masterpiece, "Sequel to Incarnation Girl," starring Yuan Meiyun, with Lu Ming, Wang Naidong, Han Langen, Guan Hongda, Qin Tong, Wang Guilin, Ye Wenqiu, Zhao Manna, and others in supporting roles, has been fully completed and is currently in the process of editing. It is scheduled to be screened on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun in "Incarnation Girl" transformed between male and female, confusing and mesmerizing, performing with superb skill. Now, in "Sequel to Incarnation Girl," she boldly attempts to portray three different personalities, reaching a state of perfection without being bogged down. Her acting skills are outstanding and a rare achievement on the silver screen. When this film is released, it will surely cause a sensation among audiences in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e194">"Little Orphan Annie Comic Strip" Sells Well <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The "Little Orphan Annie Comic Strip" published by Xinhua Film Company, drawn by cartoonist Zhang Leping, is not only superb in its brushwork and meticulous in its layout but also novel in its composition and luxuriously decorated. It also features thirty-eight expressive photos of Chen Juanjuan taken by Shi Dongshan, which are clever, adorable, and hard to come by. Currently, the company, considering the banditry and false peace in Suiyuan, and the national donations to aid the war effort, and to show patriotism, has specially offered 20,000 copies of the book, with the proceeds to be used for aid to Suiyuan. To stimulate readers' interest, the young star Chen Juanjuan personally signed the books as a souvenir. Donating to save the country is the duty of every citizen, and the book is exquisite, lovely, and inexpensive, selling for only five cents. It achieves several goals at once, benefiting both the public and private interests. In recent days, the company has been overwhelmed with inquiries and purchases of the book. The book is available at various newspaper vendors, bookstores, and cinemas. Direct mail to the company at the third floor of the Gong Stage on Edward Road is also possible.</p>
