<h3>危機四伏的奧地利（下）</h3>
<p>— Lauis　Fisher　賓符譯</p>
<p>當墨沙尼里尼在勃倫納山隘動員制止了一九三四年七月納粹的暴動時，他對奧的政策可說已將完成了，所未完成的只是還沒有一個權力主義的政府。這至今是一個沒有權力的政府啊。據精密觀察家的估計，在奧國有三分之一是社會黨和共產黨，三分之一的天主敎社會黨，百分三十的國社黨；其餘大的只有絲數的百分之三或二，是願意選舉休樞尼格的，如果他們可以選舉的話。休樞尼格內閣是以斯帶倫堡的內衛團的槍枝做後盾，那內衛團是一種非正式的軍事組織。斯帶倫堡是一個大地主，這些軍隊就是由他所供給，或是由意國軍火輸匈的贏利所支持着。墨沙里尼自然討厭社會黨，所以當奧國社會黨干涉意匈軍火貿易時，他們便被排斥爲不合法的政黨。因此，在今日的奧國，沒有議會，沒有政黨，沒有人民的後盾，沒有出版的自由，也沒有工會。她只有恐怖，只有長期監禁和任意開拆外國旅行者的書信奧國的政治「獨立」正可從她的經濟「獨立」中去求得解釋。她重要的企業是跑冰鞋樂器等，現在更有破壞制裁的商品。沒有人會希望斯帶倫堡或休樞尼格失歡於墨沙里尼。可是對意輸出却受意國的購買力限制着。奧國儘可以她富饒的木材和造紙原料輸給意國。可是她不能機續以現金輸入原料而又輸給意國來換里拉或水菓。這無異於奧國以欠欵賒給意國，結果勢必喪失硬幣的準備，使奧國難以維持下去。不久後，意大利就等於是在制裁她自己了。近幾月來，奧國因不參加制裁所得的捷德輸意商品的過境稅是很可觀的。一九三五年的經濟狀况顯得是改善了，然而大都是表面的。官方的失業統計不可靠。維也納街上充滿着貧窮的景象，政府紛紛張貼着吿示，要求民衆賑濟饑餓的老少。被重重的關稅壁壘包圍在狹隘的疆域中，奧國經濟的前途眞是未見光明而且難以上軌道的啊。</p>
<p>爲了應付這種優局，維也納的政治家便玩起一套無謂的滑稽把戲來。他們想以哈布斯堡皇室復辟來阻止德國的併吞。有許多人却相信這只有促進德奧合併。不過它的重要性總抵不過以法國爲後盾的小協的國堅决的反對沃都大公或任何其他皇族的復位。意大利並不曾怎樣阻止奧國復辟的傾向。這愈益加深了捷克和南斯拉夫對於哈布斯堡襲位的仇恨，因爲這兩國預見到：第一，意大利和哈布斯堡有聯合向南新拉夫收回哥羅西亞的可能；第二，奧匈的聯合將减弱小協約的九量他們都是反匈的，因爲匈牙利要收回她在和的下所割讓給他們的土地；第三，哈布斯堡將在不調和的小協的三國中——捷克，南斯拉夫和羅馬尼亞——宣傳破壞的陰謀。小協的反對哈布斯堡復辟，甚於德奧合併，但兩者都是他們所要竭力阻止的。那進退不得的貴族和腐化的皇室遺緒，既吾决了他們的沃都，只力勸各市區選舉他做他們的榮譽的市民，有許多市區已經實行這個步驟了，對於其餘的，他們只能希望着，因爲除此之外，他們更沒有別的辦法了。斯帶倫堡還只三十六歲，漂亮，熱情，且別有着存心。他是可能做哈布斯堡攝政的。但是攝政並不一定席不暇暖就讓位給皇太子；霍賽（Horthy匈牙利的攝政——譯者註）已攝政好多年了。一個副總理可以隨時退職。一個攝政却大抵是任期終身。這樣下下去的發展是可能的。小協的也不能反對。</p>
<p>人們不該過於重視今日奧國的統治者。他們之拒絕把他們狹隘的政治機構的基礎擴大起來，至少是爲了幻想那美麗的皇冠的迷夢，那眞是悲劇的也許是危險的兒戲啊，奧國要從意德二個法西斯國家問解脫出來而實現今日奧國獨立的空虛口號，其唯一途徑就是建立一個民主政府。這楚小恊終所同情的，她們並且竭力促成它。敎皇也有贊許的可能；因爲他深恐德國的反天主敎政策移植到這中歐惟一的天主敎國家。</p>
<p>獨裁制是奧國的弱點。牠使國家投誠到國外獨裁者的懐抱中。奧國近年來的寧靜，多半是基於二大法西斯蒂者的對立。可是現在意大利正在忙着阿比西尼亞和地中海的事情，德國爲什麼不趁此機會併吞奧國呢？是的，近來奧國和德國的國社黨在奧國國內確乎不大活動。他們似乎是退隱了，雖然黑沙里尼曾經暗示他將縱容德國的倂奧以威嚇英法，德國目前對奧按兵不動的情形，實是歐洲一伴嚴重的事情。雖然事情也許會因列强間形勢的轉移而緩和，可是奧國所給與世界的影響究竟是太大了。德國之所以不乘機卽發，乃是希特勒內部情形的困難。希特勒知道奧國是一條足以引起歐洲大火的導火錢，所以他聰明地暫時抑止着，以避免這種危機。</p>
<p>當德國的慾燄似乎稍抑下去的時候，英國的勢力便抬頭起來了。中歐和東南歐現在正引望着英國爲她們的盟主。這些國家倒也並不是背離了法國，實在還只是深恐法國有把她們丢棄的傾向。不過，除非內部的政治機構能適合國家的需要和民衆的願望，英國或　　的勢力是不見得穩固可靠，而外國的投資也不是安全的。（完）</p>

<h3>國貨維持會電請中央　厲行國貨服制條例　通令各省查禁奇裝異服　仿保甲制挨戶勸導實行</h3>
<p>中華國會維持會、昨日分電行政院·財政部·內政部·實業部云、竊我國為以農立國之國家、江浙兩省、蠶桑之盛、甲於天下、自古為富庶之區、因之蠶絲織品、暢銷全國、兼及海外、不但凡百商業繁榮、而農村經濟、亦極充盈、蓋出品之尊貴耐着、極有價値、一襲之衣、可傳數世、裨益民生、良非淺鮮、故如江蘇之寗·鎭·蘇丹·盛·滬、浙省之杭·嘉·湖·寗·紹·等處產綢之區、市　興盛、工商交榮、全繫於此、乃自輓近</p>
<p>國綢外銷</p>
<p>旣被各國重稅所屛斥、而僅存之國內銷路、又為外貨及人造絲織品來華傾銷、經濟侵略、近年加盛、至今日則無孔不入、已成喧賓奪主之勢、且國貨銷路、華北方面絕、以致商業無路可走、遂致社會金融、益形柘窘、工商崩潰、農村破產、卒至民窮財盡、國難日深、揆其原內、雖不止一端、而受人造絲織品　奪蠶絲品之　、則最為重大、查我國眞絲織品自被人造絲織品侵銷以來、已陷絕境、而農村恃為命脈之蠶桑主要產物、亦幾被淘汰、瀕於破產、農工商賈交受其害、民財旣　、國家安得不日形貧弱、此等危害國家之物、實甚於洪水猛獸、本　早識其患、特於民國元年公推代表進京請願、請令頒中民國</p>
<p>服制條例</p>
<p>旋經參議院議决、於是年十月三日以大總統命令公佈條例、規定男女禮常各服之材料、均用國貨絲棉麻毛織品、且各種服式顏色及尺寸、亦皆明白　定、佈告週知、方期藉此得以維持將　之蠶絲織品、挽救失敗之農村蠶桑、不謂言者諄諄、聽者藐藐、視條例如具文、等弁髦於法令、我行我素、競尚時髦、蓋以號為摩登之　裝、不問是否為本國貨、但知標奇鬥異、競誇新裝。暮楚朝秦　時翻茶、因之外洋人造絲織品得乘隙　入、與我蠶絲綢緞及布疋爭奪市場、而愛國心薄弱之我國同胞、遂不惜大好金錢、以購此危害國本之物、將國絲棉織品之綢緞、反鄙棄置、何怪外人</p>
<p>漏稅私運</p>
<p>大量人造絲棉織品傾銷全國、以迎合國人心理、天下事之可痛恨、可　可憐、孰有甚於此乎、且我國為農業國、絲棉等農產品、素極豐富、供給全國之需要而有餘、如仿各國之護國保商及山西汔之自製自給政策、本不能容人造絲織品暨人造絲輸入競爭、致釀成今日之嚴重結果、迨大錯旣鑄、尾大不掉、我國造綢商人、不得不飲酖止渴、攙用人造絲以資改良、俾合市銷、豈知愈改良而人民生計愈絕、蠶絲織品固被打倒、即人絲織品亦以花式日新、變幻百出、今日風行一時、明日即為陳腐、致令綢廠目迷五色、無所適從、營業衰敗、巳臻</p>
<p>朝不保暮</p>
<p>之境、其已遭犧牲者、如　　續成　虎林　等廠、其外二者閉歇者不知凡幾、失業工商、呼籲無門、坐以待斃、而現在僅存之綢業、亦尚在苟延殘喘之中、此外連帶影響受害較重者、為典業衣業、緣此等人造絲織品之服裝、毫無價値、不能保障與保藏、且衣服尺寸混亂、花式離奇、致典衣業頓變無法經營、其餘如棉織業·皮貨業·繡業·鞋業·等、亦俱因此江河日下、振拔　由、嗚呼、以如此切身利害之問題、反熟視無覩、不思一根本挽救之策、、殊可異也、　聞織綢廠商、尚以人造絲為目下必需品、於是遂有一時不能捨棄之說、殊不知該項人造絲、</p>
<p>危害國本</p>
<p>旣如此嚴重、刻下華北方面、棉織·海產·等貨、數量極鉅、潛運各地市場、儘量傾銷、若不籌設根本挽回之策、亡國慘禍、迫在眉睫、本會考慮再三、權衡輕重、為實行先總理民生主義、救濟農村破產、維持國產事業計、亟應呈請政府　通令各省市縣政府曁黨部、督促毛織品之服裝、其於女界之奇裝異服、袒胸露臂者、尤應厲行查禁、或由各省建設　籌設國立服制局、令飭各縣城鄕仿保甲制度、挨戶勸導、督促實行、良以一國之服裝、關係於國家社會者至形重大、理應以服用本國材料之服裝為根本原則、試觀東西各國人民、均各服用其本國出品、以固國本、决無如我國之棄置、</p>
<p>國貨織品</p>

<h3>上海之彩印業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信　主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之廿五）</p>
<p>四·油墨與印刷機——彩印所需之原料甚多，如鉛皮，橡皮，手絨毯，玻璃彈子，玻璃砂，磷酸，碌酸等皆是，惟所費較多或較大者，則為紙張，油墨，印刷機三者。關於紙張，本所在「上海之造紙業」一文中，已有記及，今僅將油墨及印刷機兩項附述於後，以供關心彩印業者之參攷。</p>
<p>油墨：吾國文化事業日趨發達，故油墨輸入亦日漸增加，初僅黑色一種，後又有各色彩墨輸入。黑色油墨專供墨色石印所用，吾國油墨所製者亦能應用。彩色油墨，吾國油墨廠雖亦能製造，惟出品尙難與外貨匹敵。彩色油墨以美貨為最佳，其次則為日貨。本埠最先經營美國油墨者，為泗涇路恒豐公司，目下似以利達公司經售較多。日商在本埠經營油墨者，有東洋油墨公司，諸星洋行，黑越公司等。吾國彩印工廠所用油墨，以日貨居多，蓋日貨售價，較美貨為廉故也。</p>
<p>油墨大概用洋鐵聽裝置，每聽重一磅或五磅，近來外貨為减少裝璜雜費起見，一部改用桶裝，凡達一百磅或二百磅者，槪用木桶裝置。</p>
<p>油墨售價不一，以美貨為最昂，日化較廉，國貨則又次之。茲將國貨與美日兩國貨物之市價約略錄之如下：</p>
<p>國貨　每磅自七八角至二三元不等</p>
<p>日貨　每磅自七八角至四五元不等</p>
<p>美貨　每磅自一二元至七八元不等</p>
<p>據云各洋商售貨，亦採用放賬辦法，其期限並無一定，以該印刷所之大小及其信用程度而定長短。近來小範圍之工廠，向油墨商購貨，一般皆用現金交易。</p>
<p>印刷機：本埠各彩印王廠所用之印刷機，不外石印機器及橡皮機器二種，石印機器最初僅印墨色，光緒初年，上海徐家滙土山灣印刷所即已用之。石印機器係以木質造成，用人力攀轉，印刷異常費力，至點石齋書局開辦時，始有輪轉石印機，惟其轉動則仍用人力，每架八人，分作兩班，輸流轉搖，仍有功倍事半之缺點。至光緒中葉，始改用自來火引擎以代人力，惟機器之呆笨，猶如往日。今日彩印所用之石印機器，則憶靈便百倍，其中以英國貨為最佳，其次則為日貨。吾國明精廠所仿造者，亦殊精美，頗為印刷工廠所樂用，此外大慶廠亦有出品云，</p>
<p>近來印刷界均購用橡皮印刷機器，石印機器似已落伍，但印刷數量較少者，則用石印機器印刷，較為便利，故印刷工廠除購備橡皮印刷機器外，往往又備有少數石印機器。石印機器當然不及橡皮印刷機器精巧，其出產力每小時僅能印一千一二百張而已。</p>
<p>橡皮印刷機以美國之美麗牌為最佳。上海現僅華一印刷公司與華業印刷公司各備一部，因其售價昂貴，非一般小廠所能購置。現今上海經售橡皮印刷機器之行家，美商有利達洋行，德商有禮和洋行，禪臣洋行，日商有濱田洋行，喜樂洋行，大普洋行，中島洋行等數家。美國美麗牌售價每部約售二萬五六千元，對開約一萬三四千元，日貨全張約一萬四五千元，對開約六七千元。普通購用日貨對開架者較多。　（完）</p>
<p>補註：前月四月十五日至十七日，本所發表上海之草帽業，共中記及北京路一九〇號匯泰草帽行之狀况，關於資本一項，實為七萬元，而非三萬元，特此更正。</p>

<h3>解放</h3>
<p>— 雷石楡</p>
<p>阿梅照常依時送飯到廂房來。這廂房很大，住下三個學生，一位是文史科老李，一位是美術科老伍，一位是政治經濟科老陳。</p>
<p>正如所學的相異一樣、他們三人的性格也不同，但大家是好朋友，從來未因小小的衝突决裂過，尤其是老伍像個女人似的，不爭論，少談他科外的事，常常呆頭呆腦的凝視着滿壁上的自己的新舊作品，或對着畫板涂幾筆，偏着腦袋瞄一瞄……他肚子裏打算着的是：這　　畫精彩點，再畫幾幀可以來一個「個人書展」，要是有二三百塊錢就……，你們兩個都是沒出息的家伙，看阿拉成名吧！</p>
<p>老李好放書砲，詩經的「興也」「賦也」唸得還算活勁；「的了那嗎」他也會操幾句，老陳稱他做古今合璧先生。他也稱老陳做國府常備委員。</p>
<p>上午十一點半，阿梅提着盛菜的扁竹筐和盛飯的銅籃來了。</p>
<p>老陳正在看着報紙，老伍　思索什麼似的徘徊着，老李在臨帖寫蘇東坡派。</p>
<p>「飯送來啦。」阿梅一走進去，就老是用這句話作招呼。</p>
<p>「擺懛，擺懛！」老李放下筆站起來，但他不收拾懛上的東西，照例先揭開那竹筐看看這餐幾種什麼菜。</p>
<p>「阿梅！你想解放不？」老陳仍緊　着報紙偏過頭來微笑地問。</p>
<p>「什麼解放？」阿梅又以為他開頑笑地但又多少驚奇地問。</p>
<p>「報吿你一個好消息吧。」他旋把視綫收縮在報紙上，掃了一掃，說：報載：……是市公安局奉內政部命令，主辦　婢登記……唔，我先問你，你實在今年幾歲？」</p>
<p>「吃飯吧！烏消息。」老李邊喃着邊走攏來，老伍也懶洋洋地渡過來。</p>
<p>「記不淸楚了。」阿梅的赭色的粗厚臉皮上綴動下下痙孿，有點羞態地答。</p>
<p>「人家的年歲關你鳥事，要是你的黃臉婆在旁一定……」老李還沒嚕囌完，老陳馬上搶着說：</p>
<p>「你擺懛去吧！我不是向你報吿的。」</p>
<p>他們幾乎沒有擺過懛，一切都是阿梅代理的。他叫老李擺懛去，不過想阿梅走近來聽，但是阿梅正在把飯菜端上懛面去。</p>
<p>「吃飯啦！吃飯啦！」老李推一推老伍，自己搶先走去，老伍也跟着來，但老陳依然坐在床緣上，也不放下報紙。</p>
<p>阿梅正提着筐籃要走，但腦海裏浮沉着「解放」，市公安局，「內政部」，「　婢登記」的語句牽慢了她的步武，同時也給老陳的「未可走！聽我報吿」命令似的一句喝住。</p>
<p>「沒時間，不問你啦。」他看見老李老伍像餓鬼似的不客氣地吃着實在着急，但這消息一定要使阿梅快活一下，於是使用他的政治經濟的綜合方法來：「那麼　要說說吧：「已經登記了的婢女，得到無條件的解放，恢復自由。婢女中如係未成年而無家可歸，或歸家而家屬無力贍養者，應送本市救濟院，或其他慈善團體安置之。……」滿十六歲而無家可歸之婢女，得徴求其本人同意，代為擇配。……已經解放之婢女，無家屬或家屬所在地不明者，得選定當地救濟院或其他慈善團體之主持人為其監護人……」</p>
<p>他還想對阿梅說幾句什麼，阿梅也想再問他一點什麼，但這餐吃虧的　脅太破壞他的「經濟原則」，他耐不住地只說了一聲「完了，完了！」作尾巴便跑過去實現肚皮經濟。</p>
<p>「你們太不客氣！像餓死！」他邊吃邊罵。</p>
<p>「時間不經濟，阿拉也有課上。」老伍和氣地答。</p>
<p>「我們不把時間化在吊梆子上，吾人不欲將飯留於課餘食……」老李的古今合璧出了盒子。</p>
<p>「我情願吊你母親的梆子不吊她的梆子，別吃醋吧！」老陳半在喉嚨裏罵。</p>
<p>「誰吃醋？那樣　　的女人阿拉値得像你那樣調情？」老李忘記了「母親」他反駁後一截。</p>
<p>他們住在這廂房差不多半年了，這廂房是位在某某坊裏一座洋式的小樓的二樓的後樓。裏面除幾個廂房外還有三樓四樓的幾個亭子間，是全部出租的，這座樓是徐姆的唯一財產，此外徐姆還在自己的住家開設大大的爐灶，為客人包飯，阿梅是她的婢女，阿梅未滿八歲時便被她買來使用，一直被使用到現在——現在阿梅十五歲了。阿梅除帮忙她燒菜外，還專任送飯。阿梅雖然已十五歲，但還常常怕徐姆打罵，她幾次想逃走，但不懂得逃到什麼地方去，她不曉得自己的家庭在什麼地方，只模糊地記得父親是被調去打什麼城的軍隊拉了去，他還記得一頭大水牛，一隻肥豬和幾隻雞都被兵捉去宰食了的；她母親死去活來的哭泣！幾天後，也無可奈何地去採樵維持生活，但終耐不住欠租欠稅納捐的壓迫，只好把阿梅出賣，最後訣別時的印象永不會在阿梅的記憶裏消掉——母親抱着還哺乳的弟弟拭着淚吩咐她道：乖乖！你不要哭，等弟弟長大，媽媽會叫你回來玩。</p>
<p>那時阿梅剛七歲，但半年後主人因賭博破產又把她轉賣給徐姆。</p>
<p>阿梅走出樓來又驚喜又惶恐地邊走胡思亂想着。</p>
<p>「這機會是多好的！」她想道：「對啦，我要解放，我要自由！要不是，眞不知給那隻老狐貍困我到什麼時候，像香秭說那位二十八歲還做婢女的麻姑，不給出嫁，嫁也沒人要，眞是可憐啦。我是十五歲吧？徐老狐貍罵過：你今年十　歲了，還不懂一點情性！是的，我十五歲了，十五歲……好似還算未成年吧？未成年……陳先生說過：未成年，無家歸……歸家無力養……送本市救濟院，送慈善團體……。唔，送進那些地方去又怎樣呢？陳先生沒有說明，大槪有床睡，有飯吃吧？睡睡床不躺老狐貍的狗窟地板，吃吃乾凈的飯不吃老狐貍的剩餘下來的冷菜硬飯也不壞。其次是：滿十六歲無家歸，本人同意……擇配，哈，這也不錯，有丈夫，和丈夫兩人生活可不更好？可惜我還有一歲才……那麼假造夠十六歲成不成？橫豎差一歲也不會被看得出……。又其次，……忘記啦，那也不要緊，解决那兩條就夠啦……。」</p>
<p>徐姆見她呆頭呆腦的思索着什麼似的慢慢地走回來，着實生　得窒了呼吸。</p>
<p>「爛臭貨！你碰了鬼嗎？怎麼去了這麼久？」</p>
<p>像眞個有鬼附在阿梅的身上，那從來沒有這樣表現過的形象倒使徐姆驚慄——眼睛睜得圓圓的，視綫像從黑夜裏的野貓的瞳孔放射出來似的，獰笑着，嘴巴做什麼示威似地動着。徐姆氣喘喘地瞠目着，但在努力保持她的威嚴。</p>
<p>「你正碰了鬼！我不是坐飛機替你趕路！」阿梅說了便假咳一聲，歪一歪臉，把筐　重力地放在板臺上。徐姆的三角眼睜得更大了，苦瓜皮似的長臉像給熨斗燙着，熱辣辣的。</p>
<p>「爛臭貨！你的屁股前世走了福氣！坐飛機！」</p>
<p>「可是現在我要福氣起來啦，哈，哈！……」阿梅像癲狂起來似的，望天痴笑一會又說：「我要去自由啦，我要去解放啦！哈，哈哈！」</p>
<p>徐姆跳突着的心稍平靑一下，但依然生氣。她以為阿梅一定受誰誑騙了，「自由」「解放」是第一次聽見她說出來。</p>
<p>「哼，自由解放！」徐姆用蔑視的語調罵：「想想你的身世吧！你的賤骨頭快就化仙啦」</p>
<p>「你以為阿梅眞個賤到底嗎？你看吧！我到市公安局去登記！」阿梅爆彈了一句就要跑出去，徐姆也順勢一掌巴煽過去，阿梅腦袋一閃，那掌巴就煽了一個空，徐姆連忙拿起板台上的一個碗子往跑出的阿梅的背後擲過去，碗子碰在門角上，砰的碎射下來。</p>
<p>「眞是鬼玩暈了這臭貨！」徐姆上氣不接下氣的罵着：「到市公安局去？除非做私娼！可是公安局的茶房也不要你的爛臭屄！」</p>
<p>她追出門外去，可是阿梅的影子像給魔鬼收去了。她又氣憤又奇怪，為什麼她要到市公安局去？但心裏反復想道：「官老爺的衙門會讓這賤種的骯髒脚踏進去？等你爛臭貨去用鐵包皮回來吧！……」</p>
<p>是的，徐姆忙得沒看過報紙——她從來不看報紙，也許不識字。她也沒有聽見過像阿梅那樣癲狂的消息，也許因為她少交際，包飯的客人也沒對她說過，而且客人又不常來坐談的。徐姆走回來，忿恨得什麼似的拾着碗的碎片。</p>
<h3>感時花濺淚</h3>
<h3>丹山村巷</h3>
<p>— 亞南</p>
<p>丹山村巷，是熱鬧的。</p>
<p>當太陽還沒有在東邊丹山後面射出紅光；白濛濛底山霧綱着村子，綱着村子外密丹山村巷丹山村巷的菓林。在山上看起來，這一片低低的白濛濛底山霧，彷彿就像一頂白紗帳子。</p>
<p>這時像上村子裏去，你便看見荘稼人推着一輛輛獨輪小木車，從村巷裏出來。車輪轤轤底響着，那些黃泥底村道上，便留下一條深深的轍痕。驢子背駝着空筐，蹄子有勁地踢着柵欄門口的泥土。一羣預備到田裏去耘麥的人們，緊緊滿是泥土底小棉襖，抬頭望望天空，口裏喃喃着：「好天，沒風。」拿起門旁底鋤頭釘耙走了。一羣小雞「嘟」的一聲從牆角裏飛出來。</p>
<p>待陽光悄悄地爬上屋角，那些茅屋頂上瓦眞突裏，都揚起了白眞了。孩子們在田　上　呼「爸爸吃飯哩。」</p>
<p>村巷，這就開始熱鬧起來了。</p>
<p>小孩啼哭聲，狗吠聲，井口邊姑娘談笑聲，碾子磨地瓜乾聲，雄雞追逐雌雞在牆角裏底飛躍聲。</p>
<p>偶而一輛汽車，或是一個新娘子打街上走過；門裏那些姑娘孩子們像一羣雞籠裏的雞似的，都飛出來了。用驚奇貪婪底目光瞅着們前走過去的人物。</p>
<p>每家的矮小門上貼着紅紙春聯：「梅因雪放，鵲為晴噪」，「三杯濃茶話桑麻，一縷淡眞遺時光。」有的還倒貼着「風調雨順」「四季太平」的小對子。但旁人是不准去說它的「倒」的，說了他們會不高興呢。</p>

<h3>日本諷刺文學的勃起（上）</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>日本的新文學，隨着時代的不安，呈現出非常危機的徴象；從去年秋直到現在，可稱調以進步的姿態　展　的文學，科是缺少之至，如果勉強的檢視下這文壇的論題底中心點，祗能舉出「諷刺文學」「歷史小說」諸事件吧。</p>
<p>的確，自從去年秋到現在，諷刺文學席捲了整個的文壇，像諷刺文藝雜誌「大鼓」的創刋，以及詩人小熊秀雄的諷刺詩的連載，　井繁治，　用鶴次郎諸人的活躍，以「巷中舞歌」這作品，被文壇認為諷刺的作家之獅子文　，並以「河童」這作品達到了諷刺的高水准之高田保　的風行，不得不說是諷刺文學汜濫的一個現象，而尤其由進步的藝術家詩人作家等組織專門創作提倡諷刺文　的「　巧俱樂部」，可以說是諷刺文學的生力軍。</p>
<p>對於這個印象，我們須首先研究他們所採取的題村，並須進而考察其社會的根據。據我所知，他們的題材，大都是關於阿比西尼惡問題，邪教問題，言論禁壓問題，帝國人造絲公司黑慕，以及其他社會的，經濟的文化的現象；這些問題與現象，不用說是目前不安的世界用至日本的現實社會之問題與現象，因為諷刺文學乃是現實主義與浪漫主義精神的產兒，所以它必然地能注意到這些問題上去（由於現實主義創造方法）並嘲諷起這些東西來（浪漫的精神）。但為什麼新文學不敢作正面的追擊，而採用諷刺的開工呢？這地方乃含有着日本現社會的意義。江口漁在「社會評論」二月號內說：「總而言之，有進步的傾向之文學，被當時的政治的勢力所壓抑，不能表現正當的意識形態時，則這文學就分解起來，向各方向轉換。其最弱者，屈伏於這壓力之下，解消了意識形態，但那雖是弱者，但其有良心而不願墮落的，則退而成虛無主義者……。」「而那強者，有理智的（甚於熱情的）要素之部分，就巧妙地避掉了與政治的壓力之下面衝突，意圖由側面奇襲，因此轉成為諷刺文學。」</p>
<p>這地方江口氏說明了諷刺文學的社會意義，現在我們再來觀察下日本各學家對於諷刺文學的意見吧：關於諷刺文學，日本文學家們的意見可分成一派——即進步的作家羣和純文藝作家羣；這裏面又可分為肯定的和否定的　派。在進步的作家　裏，表示肯定的（贊成的）有「刪巧但樂部」諸人，像壺井繁治說：「我們一看那些個諷刺文學咒罵者的話，就能感到那完全是無有封建性劣根性的主義者之話；也就是對於那些自己做不出而他人能做得出的新工作之人，抱着恐怖（來威脅自己。）但比較地建立了諷刺論的槪念的，可以說是本田　　的「諷刺與笑」　。他說：「文學全　　　　　　　，抒情，劇，三個分野。「猶歌謠之需要高揚和歡喜，衣歌之需要悲哀　悉一般，諷詩需要憤懣和輕蔑。總而言之，這二者是抒情詩的三大形式。」；實在，我們回顧過去偉大的諸作品，無不含有諷刺的精神，甚之「神曲」的地獄篇，　戈理莫利衣諸作品，都是很好的例子。諷刺文學之需要是不用說的，而問題的中心，在於如何的處理。</p>
<p>現在再來介紹一下進步作家羣的反對者吧，可以說是這派的代表的，是評論家戶板潤和林房雄，但後是不　一向的漫罵口吻的。</p>
<p>戶板潤在「作為思想的文學」之第二部「對於諷刺文學」中說道：「最初我曾說過，一面想反逆社會秩序，但一面還不得不停於社會秩序的一環上的塲合裏，叫在某種意義上，諷刺文學是必要的，這種說法，並不是說處在這種情　之作家及廣義的文學者所取的處世方針，乃是說在同一的秩序裏。不得不反逆這秩序的這種矛盾的事物關係之客觀條件，定要產生出諷刺及諷刺文學。如果是革命的實踐家，　對於這「諷刺的」現實，是用變革活動這形式來活動，但文學者是個文學者的關係，祗好以所謂的形式之文筆活動，與這現實相接近。</p>
<p>但如果諷刺文學並不是靠着看法寫法表現的特別樣式成為諷刺文學；而是現實是必需要諷刺的時候所不得不產生的文學之一般的　色的話，則在現代世界上，分別了諷刺文學和非諷刺文學，而提倡諷刺文學，這不是有點兒變態嗎？</p>
<p>總之，據他的意見，諷刺文學是與非諷刺文學無區別的，現實是「諷刺的」的埸合，則一切文學都是諷刺的，諷刺文學乃是這「諷刺的」現實之必然的產品，毫無提倡的必要；這也就是對於現文壇的諷刺文學的呼聲之一個否定。</p>
<p>至於林房雄呢，則仍舊充滿了他的漫罵英雄的色彩，他說提倡諷刺的，都是其自身病理學的現象，他說提倡諷刺的，都是其自身病理學的現象，非過正常的精神生活者的事業。他在「諷刺的諷刺」裏說：因此，如果想寫諷刺文學時，那就須另組織「夢的研究會「等，因為當你覺得大東京的夜和盡七轉八倒有點神經變亂時，趕快請腦病院長齊藤茂吉去診察，如果診斷說不錯，然後再執筆。」他又揶揄着諷刺作家說：「請讀讀果戈理的傳記吧！世上沒有像他再討厭的人了。他實在是個綜合了在「死靈魂」「檢察官」裏出現的汚濁的諸人物的諸性格。」</p>
<p>「斯威夫特（Swift　Jonathan海外軒渠錄的作者怎麼樣呢？那個人一看他的臉，就像隻祗吃憂　和憎惡而過活的一令蝦蟆·傲慢，野心家，策略家，一日不罵人就　不下飯。……他自己是瘋狂的，因此覺得人們都瘋狂，因此在死時，曾有遺言道：將財產都建設瘋人狂人病院。」</p>
<p>「至於海湼，那毒舌簡直　變態的。」</p>
<p>以上是林房雄憎惡諷刺文學進而憎惡諷刺文學作家的一個例子。其實我曾在二三年前，讀過他的一篇「特等席」，即是種諷刺作家同盟幹部的一篇諷刺小說，至今深印在腦裏，但不知林房雄如何來解釋這矛盾。</p>
<h3>五月</h3>
<p>— 錫金</p>
<p>紀念着罷，伙伴！五月有的</p>
<p>炎毒的太陽炙乾了我們的血；</p>
<p>也在這當兒我們驚醒了，</p>
<p>那給惡者出乎意外，大吃一嚇</p>
<p>人乃把五月看作不祥了，</p>
<p>是的，就在這不祥的月裏，</p>
<p>我們在心上都樹起了戰旗；</p>
<p>冷靜點兒，你先看看淸楚，</p>
<p>血的五月要準備下血祭。</p>
<h3>行旅</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>像蛤蟆一樣，住在陰暗而潮濕的狹小的洞中，沒有太陽照拂那小的天地，也沒有花草點綴那小的天地，人的視綫是愈弄愈短了，人的生活愈弄愈單調了。當我從學校投入社會，那種孤獨而不明世故的脾氣，雖則與一切都有些不相調和，好像一個猢猻離開了樹一樣，失掉牠原來的憑藉，可是那份野性，一時期曾經實行的流浪的生活，還是保留於理想中。經過幾年定滯的生活，紙堆與墨屑，不單把一個人的生活，弄得無味，而且把那堅實的身體弄壞了。第一眼給人家的印象，就是那憔悴的身體，似乎已載不起那笨重的辛勞，實際上這幾年來我空間幹了一些什麼有意義的事呢？在自己都是一個啞迷。到了一個時間，跟着馬路上潮水一般湧着的人們走到一個地方；到了另一個時間，又跟着馬路上潮水一般湧的人走到另一個地方，眼睛所見的是一羣灰色的人們，鼻中所吸的是都市汚濁的空氣，如此而已，這便是人生。但自己總覺得人生不是這樣。人生究竟是什麼呢？也許自己是知道的，也許自己是不知道的，知道與不知道，究其實際，並沒有多大重要，只要一個小型的固定的　會，就會决定了一個定型的人，我是這樣的想，這樣的想念，推測起來，並不與事實相去太遠，這我可確定的。</p>
<p>願生活當中有一點兒波瀾吧！理想並不奢，只要一點兒，一點兒新的刺激，給我一點兒新的活力就夠了。這自然也是一個夢想。身體的病態，引起心理的病態的我，我知過，决不會因為什麼小的波瀾就會有多大精神上的變換，可是一個希望總是比現實　美麗些。讓美麗的外衣，蒙起我的眼，我的耳，讓明亮的思想　過我的灰色的思想，黑暗的情緒吧。當我跨進了京滬車中，半月來陰沉的天氣，忽然開朗了，撥開了我心境的幽悒；氣候的溫暖，也增高了我血液的速度。陌生人的顏面，覺得親切，嘈雜的人聲，覺得悅耳。時間　交立夏，可是　的脚還逗留在大地。我呼吸着春的濃重氣息，這氣息有些使人疲倦，但並不使人不愉快。火車加速進行，把兩旁原野摔到後面去。江南的原野，原有牠特殊的地方彩色，那就是一望無恨的靑靑麥苗當中，有時夾雜一方塊的鮮艷的紫雲英，更把鐵路旁邊狹長的原野，點綴得更美麗些，正如女人烏黑的髮脚下，偶然戴上一朶鮮艷的花，增添了不少嫵媚一樣。車過了鎭江，山多起來，水也長起來，原野也狹起來，江的雄偉，山的秀媚，原野暮色的蒼茫，和稀少的旅客的娓婉的談論，使人並沒有覺得剛出門時所預想的個人行旅的寂寞那會事。太陽轉着血紅的世輪，從掛在西方烏黑的雲端露出半個臉，我的眼睛正視它，它也不會像在中天時那般輝耀，使眼也不能睜開。夕陽的無限好，大槪就是在它的可以親近吧。可惜不長久，它終於從遠處的綠楊中逐漸沒入地平綫下去了。第一天的落日是這樣在江南道上目遂它下去的。等到第二天看落日時，已是北方的黃土　了。一片荒漠的平原開展出去，只近處的幾棵洋槐，與遠處幾　作為將來肥料而栽植的苜蓿，有點兒綠色，大地是昏黃的，太陽的光芒也是昏黃的。車輪大小的落日在遠處的地平綫上，因為車迅速向北進行，看起來它也在迅速向北進行，似乎是在與車賽跑，終於因為它的不能搶過車的前面，而羞赧地躱到地下去了。</p>
<p>當太陽下去後，原野的廣漠單純，覺得沒有什麼可看了，默默無言地離開了窗口，踏進了幽暗的臥車中，腦中縈迴着從來沒有看到過的印象，拿了一枝鉛筆，想把這印象記下來寫，寫了幾行，因為車震動得太厲害，手用力太猛，鉛筆尖忽然折斷了。摸出洋刀，預備把鉛筆消尖了。把刀口撥開時，一個不當心，右手第二個指頭觸着了刀口，切開了一大塊，最初一些不覺得，等到看到有一滴的圓的血珠，才曉得手已切開了。看着那流血的手指，心中一怔，先用稿紙抹去了一些血跡，然後再打開了箱子，拿了些棉花，帮布，橡皮膏，將割破的手指包着好了後，心裏旣感到懊惱，手也有了些痛楚，摔開了紙，摔開了鉛筆，爬上了臥鋪，將頭蒙在絨氈裏，聽那單調而　濁的火車聲，心裏非常傷感。同時想到買這洋刀的時候，一位親愛的朋友，曾經開頑笑地對我說：「你這把刀眞快，讓我來割開你的血管，喝你的血吧！」現在手算的割　了，血也算的流出了，可是我那位朋友即使在我的旁邊，我斷定他沒有這樣的忍心來喝我的血吧。</p>
<p>車的震動，手的痛楚，心情的傷感，不能使我睡熟，把毯子揭開去向窗外張望，夜色已掩沒了大地。一天又過去了。自己不自覺地又想起自己愛讀而曾經譯過的　慈（Gohn　Keats）一首詩：</p>
<p>過去了一天，過去了一天所有的甜蜜！</p>
<p>甜蜜的聲音，甜蜜的嘴唇，柔嫩的手，更柔嫩的胸脯。</p>
<p>溫暖的呼吸，輕微的耳語，愛慰的半音。</p>
<p>明媚的眼睛，嫻雅的體態，柔弱的腰圍！</p>
<p>凋殘了花朶和它的開放的嬌艷，</p>
<p>消逝了我眼前美的景象，</p>
<p>消逝了聲，曖，潔白的樂園——</p>
<p>在黃昏掩罩的時候，無端湮滅，</p>
<p>在類似的心境中，於是到想類似的感傷文字，而讀這類似的感傷文字，愈加感傷的成份。這些過去的滓渣，自己也非常痛恨，可是這些渣滓的勢力，却又頑固地盤居於自己的思想中。如果把一批人所罵的Intellige　ngeu　tia的特質，加以列舉出來，我自己都具備着。假使想振作的話，我應該與過去絕緣，我應該淸理過去的渣滓，我應該讓過去的情緒死去。時間還來得及，讓我從頭做起吧。　十四·北平·</p>

<h3>紗花　賣氣重振　紗市略形回挫</h3>
<p>紗市轉趨平靜、氣勢和緩、市場交易益覺减少、故升降範圍不若上日之狂暴、但上日激漲太烈、昨則略形回挫、同時現紗生意仍屬呆滯而無生色云、</p>
<p>近遠拔開不遠</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以上日漲力太暴、近月以多方準備收貨一萬包、裝運四川銷售說、五六月期獨堅、拍至遠期轉趨下挫、跌落九角至一元二角、二盤以後、多方意態挺拔、浮戶活動抵補、急轉上騰、中期復漲至上日收盤、迨至三收盤、聞現紗生意岑寂、賣氣重振、轉趨下墮、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元六角至一元一二角、惟本月漲二角、午後開盤各月可見上升六·七市價步步下跌、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一元一角、遠跌五·六·七角、查賣出大孚三千五百包、通記七百包、賡豐一千一百包、興昌二千〇五十包、森康九百五十包、大昌呈二千四百五十包、益昶八百包、生源七百五十包、慎記九百包、九一一千三百包、泰昌六百五十包、大豐七百包、買進長豐三千三百包、信誠二千二百五十包、晋康一千八百包、潤康五千〇五十包、永大八百包、合興一千五百包、恒益一千四百五十包、聚興一千一百五十包、明德七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>棉花隨海外下跌</h3>
<p>棉市趨疲、因美棉新花、南方壓迫而下跌、印棉亦無力下落、至於投機商、目光集中棉紗、對於棉花暫見冷淡、因之市狀愈形不振矣、</p>
<p>標花回跌三四角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉新花跌八至十五磅音、印棉跌〇二五至一羅比半、大阪三品亦跌二三角、市場人心不佳、趨熱愈見轉弱、各月跌二三角、二三盤仍屬平　、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二三角、午後開盤、各月略昂、回漲五分至一角、二盤以後、紗市乏力、市氣平萎結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至一角半、查賣出裕大三千担、德大一千七百担、通記二千八百担、大豐二千三百担、大昌成五千七百担、新昶一千七百担、潤康二干七百担、長和二千四百担、合興一千二百担、同孚一千二百担、森康一千五百担、買進大孚二千一百担、梅記二千六百担、元一四千四百擔、長豐八千六百擔、晋康一千擔、大豐一千五百擔、經華一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>元芳漂細布價格獨秀</h3>
<p>昨為元芳第二九九〇次叫莊、陳列疋件三十箱、拍開泰西緞·元絨·直貢呢·元府綢、價比上期略遜、惟龍飛牌府裯升二角、元羽綢互有升降、均祇二三角上落、洋紅布重磅價尚挺秀、洋藍布次白洋紗價平局、漂細布額少、僅排五花洞子八子兩牌、升漲三五角為獨秀、市形有繼漲之狀云、</p>
<h3>油市　美國煤油出產造成新紀錄</h3>
<p>近週每日平均超過三百萬桶</p>

<h3>糧食　傳廠方準備交貨　六月期粉跌勢最厲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼則突現崩潰之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥近期回漲九角、遠漲三角、坎拿大漲一角零、開價時、因洋麥之漲、人心尚佳、旋則鑒於天時良好異常、各路小麥報吿、亦的順利、而現粉　化不暢、又為公認之事實、是以人心虛軟、多頭回吐、空頭則大量加碼、故各月份喊價、均步步軟落、迫至下午開盤、六月份市面、又若江河日下、有不可抵禦之勢、良以新陳關係、　面終高於七月份、照月下情形、本外埠廠家之粉、有盡量吐出、準備交貨之傳說、是以跌度甚狂、最低竟至二元九角一分二厘半、遠期因多頭競爭較差、祇落三五分、據業中推測、如現銷不起、六月份當不免受挫云、</p>
<h3>期麥午後突跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤、各月份初呈平定、以洋麥報價、回漲一二角至二九角不等、市場人心、不免各趨觀望、各月份開價、大致與前日相仿、迨至下午開盤、則形勢大變、因粉市既吿大跌、氣候又復良佳、業中心思、一致不振、而內地帮方面、又出而套售、故各月份交易既暢、市面亦步步鬆動、計六月份跌八分、遠跌五六分不等、照目下之環境、此後市面、尚看步落、現麥到貨無幾、未有見交云、</p>
<p>小麥美政府本週天氣報吿順利、五月期空頭補進、數處發生風沙、無甚緊要、五月期脫售後、新麥月份之套賣、將使價格難以漲起、</p>
<h3>洋莊芝麻原盤未跌　雜糧交易異常淸淡</h3>

<h3>高料薄稻尙有去路</h3>
<p>（滬門）昨日各帮來源、共到近二十號、貨共四千餘石、本街銷場又見平淡、包子則有南北洋兩　辦去二千餘包、惟都屬高料、致薄稻市呈高定中疲之局、厚早粳平軟、北洋尖及陰變元悉平庸　（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源三十六號、市上各貨均屬平淡、白粳價形和平、薄稻平疲、羊杜秈埠客秈定勢、白元零化尚可、市形定局、其餘各貨價與前市相仿、</p>
<h3>客秈行囤一再貶價　本街成交因之略多</h3>
<p>昨客秈略有續到、江西與溫台各埠中次米尤多運申求脫、因天氣已熱、米粒較次者已有受熱、行囤更為亟亟求售、中次各檔價又貶小角半、較高各米亦稍帶落三五分不近角不一、去路內地已呆、昨有泉州辦去浙油米二百包、本街胃口本淡、乃以客囤貶價求售、故成交略多、全日開出江河米五千五百五十七包、浙米二百包、溫台米二百五十包、　元米一百包、除浙米為泉帮辦去外、統為本街收進云、</p>
<h3>四月份桐油出口狀况</h3>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報吿、四月份桐油出口、經檢騐合格者、計一、一八一·八三公担、去年同月輸出為一六、六七八·九五公担、相比雖减落甚巨、但本年一月以降累計數字較去年約增一萬六千公担、查本埠四月份市况、隨漢市至刺激、白桐油每噸價暴漲至一、三〇〇元、較上月之一、〇七四元、上升二二六元之鉅、可見桐油外銷之暢旺矣、茲將四月份出口數量列表如下、</p>
<p>上海桐油輸出數量國別統計（單位…公担）</p>
<h3>糖市　海南赤又小一角　昨運到二千三百餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市以交易仍少、趨勢平定、且對於走私貨、政府已定有嚴　懲治條例、人心因此稍穩、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二斤、轉口貨六元八角、東赤白以及本廠綿白、振記大華金心等均乏更動、國產糖趨勢仍無振色、如潮靑原價行方觀望不進、海南赤因昨慶元輪入口、又到二千三百六十二包、號盤反見續鬆、開出二百餘包、價為十元九角、比之前盤又小一角、其他什路赤白糖、如興化大貢白　號方到仔漸缺、喊價略高、普通貨平平、零星稍有開出、認若安海赤·京赤·明京赤等均軟弱少受、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蜜棗軋缺售盤堅昂</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>解釋公共塲所賭博疑義的疑義</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>蘇高等法院，呈請解釋；　商店住戶，藉口婚壽喜慶，右公共塲所公然賭博則物，是吾搆成賭博罪，　刑法二六六條但書，供人暫時娛樂之物，有無限制興標準，如麻雀牌九之類。業經司法院統一解釋法令會議决，在公共塲所睹博財物，應搆成刑法二六六條之罪，至同條但書，係指以供人暫時娛樂之物，與賭具之爲何物無關，確眞，既准許他們娛樂，准許他們賭博，則賭具之爲何物，當然可以不問，而公然在公共塲所公然賭博，自應立法禁制，但是我因這兩個問題，而更有一小小的疑點。</p>
<p>在公共塲所公然賭博財物者，應搆成賭博罪，不問商店住戶，婚壽喜慶，但供人賭博者，一律要禁，但是人民婚壽喜慶等事，旣屬偶然，而賓客盈門，絕無聊賴，借賭博爲娛樂，藉財物爲贏輸，爲時既屬甚暫，於情亦有可諒，原非呼朋引類，聚賭抽頭者可比，並且婚壽喜慶，當有事實可憑，未便空言藉口，卽時間亦當有所限止，原不得借婚壽喜慶等事，而一味抽頭聚賭也。</p>
<p>在公共塲所，公然賭博財物者，應搆成賭博罪，反之，則不在公共塲所，公然賭博者，卽不能構成賭博罪，但論事實，則在私人住宅，公然賭博，呼朋引類，聚賭抽頭者，此種行爲，我見非罕，若此種情形，而不加以制止，亦非事理之平，但其事實的發生，則不在於公共塲所，而在私人住宅，則此種行爲，應搆成賭博罪乎？抑不搆成賭博罪乎？</p>
<p>總之王道不外入情，立法允貴乎恕，假定呼朋引類，聚賭抽頭，無論在公共塲所當禁，卽不在公共塲所亦當禁，假定因婚壽喜慶等事，偶然供客娛樂，無論在私人住宅不必禁止，卽在公共塲所，亦當視爲例外也。</p>
<h3>打獵</h3>
<p>— 祝康</p>
<p>當風沙停住不刮時，黑暗的夜悄沒聲的離開了草原，靜寂給牲口呌聲撞破，各種不同的音饗在原野上波動。炊烟打蒙古包裏冒出很快的就去籠罩了沙棗樹，被燃燒着的牲口糞，到處飛散着惡臭。狗放縱的在草叢中奔跑，帶着露濕的身子狂吠，想一下子咬破天似的。女入們做完祈禱就動手燒早餐，孩子哭嚷攪擾着她們，把肉放進鍋裏，，就趕快去抱過孩子，坐在爐邊，一手燒火，一手把孩子喂奶，糞烟撲着她們的臉，但絲毫聞不到臭味，那已經被惡臭把嗅覺麻醉了</p>
<p>札比諾從佛案前爬起便帶着妹妹阿尼羅那去放牲口，當他把棚欄門開了時，羊咩咩的呌着跑出來，成羣跟在阿尼羅那後邊，向着草場奔去。牛，馬，都活蹦亂跳的跟隨着、草原上充滿了噪雜的聲浪。</p>
<p>索齊老婆子風狂的呌嚷着追出夢古包：</p>
<p>「阿尼羅那！等一等啊，牛還沒擠奶咧！阿尼羅那」。</p>
<p>然而阿尼羅那早已穿過胡桐樹行，在草塲上玩着羔羊，興興緻緻的唱着國列奔圖的牧歌。</p>
<p>到吃早餐時，札比諾已把他那匹心愛的獵馬喂飽，而且把馬身上沒有脫光的冬毛，都梳掉，此刻那馬渾身四蹄都是順色，細短的毛皮閃着亮光，特別是那肥大結實的屁股，呌人一看就知道是匹「生龍活虎」般的獵馬，誰見了不心愛呢？</p>
<p>索齊老婆子又吃又咕嚕，埋怨兒子托比諾不該把那匹黃馬賤賣：</p>
<p>「你收家子！那麽好的牲口幾個錢就賣了！」</p>
<p>她嘮叨慣了，任什麽事不論好歹，她都得囉皂囉皂，兒女摸透她的皮氣，所以總不理會她，彷彿她的話沒進耳朶一樣。</p>
<p>太陽高高的掛在天空，遠山和草原都現出了鮮明的色彩。陽光伴着微風，溫柔的親吻草地，親吻樹林，親吻牲口羣，見朶嫩河也舒適的和陽光擁抱。吱吱喳喳不住嘴　呌噪的鴉鵲，在林樹間穿來穿去，像是快活父像煩愁。札比諾騎着馬一直溜着昆朶嫩河畔走。他吹着口哨，眼望着河內的流水，馬蹄偶然碰着　火引石子，使閃出焃焃的火星。</p>
<p>穿過細葦叢離草地不遠便是沙灘，他跳下馬，背了獵槍在葦叢裏亂鑽亂喊，沒抽擔烟工夫就有一隻黃羊（註）跳出，三條腿往沙灘上跑，托比諾描準牠，碰的一聲，黃羊倒在草地上了，他乍時奇怪黃羊怎麼會藏在葦草裏？等他看到黃羊已經傷了一條後腿，才明白牠是給獵戶追到葦叢。</p>
<p>沿着河岸，馬撒轡的奔馳。蚱蜢在草梢上飛來飛去，不住的敲着翅膀。閃光的河水，汨汨流着。胡桐樹的綠葉泛着油光，不時在顫動。馬慢下來，噓噓的喘，托比諾看看卡多上快到了，就讓馬休憩一回。</p>
<p>微風飄過一陣馬鳴，托比諾隨着聲音望時，從卡多山下過來一隊人馬，遠遠看去有十來個人，他疑心是馬賊？忽然又想起了，今天是克興薩貝勒的壽誕，這是別的地方來祝壽的人。放心的騎上馬再走，沒一歇兒工夫迎頭碰到了那帮人——啊！是外路人啊！</p>
<p>騎馬的外路人們都帶着傢伙，身材都不天，他不覺有些膽虛。</p>
<p>「站住！你往那裏去？一個有小鬍的傢伙喊住了托比諾，一把把托比諾從馬上揪下。</p>
<p>「到卡多山去打獵！」托比諾雖然害怕，却使勁壯着膽子，喀爾喀入是永遠不怯儒的！</p>
<p>「你知道卡多山束坡，有軍隊嗎？」一聽說話的腔調就知道這是喀爾滿喀人</p>
<p>那個喀爾滿克蒙古人帮着那些矮人們把托比諾搜了一遍，甚麽都沒有搜出。</p>
<p>「一定是奸細！帶走他！兩個矮子開始動手來綁托比諾，托比諾掄臂一轉，那兩個人立刻栽倒地上，他已快的跳上馬，狠命的打着馬跑，飛也似的奔馳着，後面的人馬也追上來，槍聲不斷的追趕，心隨着馬蹄跳動，眼看要趕上，他回頭一槍，領頭那個騎馬的翻下馬去，再開第二槍時，已經被後面飛來的子彈打傷了左臂，他忍痛的奔跑。</p>
<p>跑着跑着，馬被一條水溝阻住，颼的一聲馬給子彈打倒了，他描準了追趕的人，一槍又打死了一個，還來不及開第二槍，敵人的如雨的槍彈把他吞食了昆朶嫩河靜靜的流着，托比諾的血染了草地，矮子的人馬向別倫肯决平原奔去。</p>
<h3>偷刀的孩子</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>淸晨的陽光抹亮了大街的平邊，另半邊仍留着陰暗。</p>
<p>就在那陰暗的半邊，有着四條人的腿在飛奔，深山裏鹿子的追逐似的。前面的兩條腿是屬於一個十一二歲的孩子的，赤着脚，骯髒的柳條布短褲吊在膝灣那兒，他不顧地下的碎玻璃屑，廢鐵釘，儘往前奔逃，他似乎覺察後面有老虎狼樣的東西在追撲他。可是，後面的兩條腿是屬於一個年輕的小販的，他拚命地緊追，前後相差至多一二碼路吧，却老是追不上。</p>
<p>他喊了：「捉小賊呵，捉小賊呵……你媽的蛋，敢偸老子的吃飯傢伙…」他又駡着，氣憤使他太陽穴邊的靑筋暴起，恨不得需要一支手槍…</p>
<p>走在陽光半邊的路人被喊聲吸引住了，紛紛走到陰暗的這半邊看究竟。</p>
<p>那奔逃在前面，被喊作小賊的孩子亦情急慌張，他似乎發現身子的四週，正有着無數的老虎狼樣的東西撲來。他這時想要一把上天的梯子，想要兩支翅翼兒。恨沒生四條腿。他想放棄衣袖裏的東西，可是心裏捨不得；「肚子不是熬過三頓了嗎，那黃魚頭的滋昧，那麻糰的芝麻香，假使他再沒有什麽東西到「拐老頭兒」的擔上去變幾個錢，飽一飽肚子，今天可熬不過了。這些人難道都不知肚皮餓的苦痛，都要帮那小販！賣水菜的，趕來抓我，我這苦命的，都不肯放過我　苦命的……」他心裏一陣酸，手一鬆，衣袖裏的東西掉落地，「鏘」的一聲，正是那柄水菓刀子，「費一早上心思，還得挨餓，挨餓……」他萬分傷心。</p>
<p>他的腿亦軟了，想停下來息息力，逃的委實疲乏了。</p>
<p>只差三步，那年輕小販拾起刀子，還不肯放鬆。那該子的短衫領子被揪住了。他大聲地哭呌，他硬喊寃枉，他畏怕水菓刀子會刺進自己的肉裏來，或者割掉耳朵，所掉鼻子，和兩隻會偸東西的手。他想把哭呌來邀人們的寬恕和同情，又想硬懶，除外，就想不出應付急難的法子</p>
<p>「你媽的偸了老子的吃飯傢伙還懶，做你這小狗×的！」那年輕小販撩起拳頭向孩子的腰部亂打，一邊打一邊駡，圍着看熱閙的發出他們的議論：</p>
<p>「這樣小的年紀便做賊，人勢越弄越壊了！」</p>
<p>「這小癟一偸束西亦不止一决了，自要給他一點辣手，下决才不敢。」</p>
<p>那年輕小販越打越有勁似的：「小賊，「你偷老子的刀，老子要你的命！」拳頭雨點似的打到他身上，他儘管「鳴鳴鳴…」的哭水在在的眼睛掃射着每個看熱閙者的臉色，想在中間發現一個救他的人，情願跪下叩一百個頭求饒，他從來也沒挨過這種毒打，他鼻孔裏放血了，滴在短衫上，地上……</p>
<p>終于，一爿衣莊店裏的朝奉出來解勸了，年輕小販這才放手，走他的。</p>
<p>孩子用手擦着眼睛，擦着鼻子，血和淚相混合，流到嘴邊，沿灰白的嘴唇流進嘴，他辨得出滋味，辛酸又帶苦澀。他打大街陰暗的半邊蹩過去……</p>

<h3>出族</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>方家灣雙井頭的那座古老的方家祠堂，今天突然把兩扇終年緊閉着的大門敞門了；門前的沙樸樹塲上，也似乎已比往日潔凈了許多，彷彿巳經有人收拾過了一番似地。</p>
<p>祠堂裏，東邊的議事廳上，桌子條凳等都已佈置得秩序井然，好像馬上就有一個什麽會議要開始。那些到鎭上去的鄉人，經過這裏，都不的而同的用一副詫異的眼睛，對那畫着兩個巨大的門神底大門瞥一下，有的甚至好奇地跨上很高的石階，把頭探進去張望一回：</p>
<p>「方家爲了什麽事情在開祠堂呵」？大家都有這樣一句疑問。</p>
<p>祠堂背後那個池塘邊上，正蹲着幾個婦人在洗東西。塌—塌—塌的搗衣聲在週遭蕩漾着，水面上也浮動着一圈一圈的水渦兒，慢慢地漾開來，一疊一疊地在池邊上茭草叢裏消失，搖得幾棵茭草不住地隴着腦袋。</p>
<p>「我早已說過，生寳娘子這麽年紀輕輕不嫁人是靠不住的。」阿興婆婆把正在米籮裏擦米的手停止了說。</p>
<h3>牛鼻子　知音</h3>
<p>— 黄堯</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？識相點早已好生生眼睛走路了，何必一定要看了這份家當出方家要的醜呢」！財生太太也停了手中正在搗衣的杵棒，歪着頭，有點憤憤然似地說。</p>
<p>「這都是根福那害人精，他自己家裏有了個老婆，還要到外面去尋野食吃……」三嬸嬸一句話選沒說完，那個尖嘴姑娘杏寳却搶了上來：</p>
<p>昨夜不知怎樣被她的大伯捉住了，聽說當阿根悄悄地從擱上爬到她房裏的時候，根福和她正在……」她說在這裏忽然住了口，兩朶紅雲飛上了她兩頰？於是她把頭低了下去。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻！正在作什麽？杏寳怎麽不說下去了一？雌阿金扮一個鬼臉笑着問你隻死×末」！杏寳不好意思地在雌阿金臉上擰了一把就跑了。</p>
<p>「聽得說今天還要開祠堂呢！」二嬸嬸很有些替她擔心的樣子。</p>
<p>「那自然，她還能够在方家門裏站脚嗎？本來她這份產業，癩頭阿根早已看得眼紅了；她現在既然自己幹了這份錯事，落得個名正言順的呌她出族！阿興婆婆厥瞅那雙癟嘴，好像能够着透一切秘密似的。</p>

<h3>「上海」與「巴黎」</h3>
<p>某處森林中有一個吃馬乳長大不諳人語的神童，其父爲匪人所殺，他立志報仇，隱身於叢林中，日惟以探得兇手爲目的，一匹勇如生龍活虎的神馬，因爲忠於幼主，不管高山峻嶺，與匪黨相週旋，及一個貌美之女郎爲患難朋友，歷盡千辛萬苦，卒獲匪類正兇，置之於法，各得完成其心願。這是上海大戲院開映「神馬泰山的劇情。</p>
<p>霞飛路巴黎大劇院今日起上演羅克「無胆英雄」。</p>
<h3>卡爾登之新計劃</h3>
<p>今晚戲映宮開片「龍鳳呈祥」</p>
<p>英國電影　　，數年以來，己經有了長足的進步，這是無可偉言的事實。自一九三〇年起，英人投資於電影界者達五百萬金鎊，有聲攝影埸超過五十座，而欺作品水準，亦有追蹤美國影片而上之勢。最近英國片商，鑒於上海之各大第一輸戲院，都己經給美國影片盤據　着，因此另起爐竃，將卡爾登戲院租下，並將戲院內部油漆一新，一切設備，亦經改良，定於今晚（星期五）晚開幕，其第一砲爲法國歷史宮闈風流鉅片「龍鳳呈祥」I　Give　My　Heart；這是英國聯合影片公司的偉大出品，由歐洲著名歌伶姬達亞爾派主演，音樂美妙，場面偉大，與桃樂絲德里奧之「風流貴婦」有異曲同工之妙。繼該戶公映的，尚有喬治亞立斯的新偉搆「風塵奇老」The　Guv'nor，麗琳哈蕙的歌舞新片Invitation　To　The　Waltz及英名小說家狄更斯的文學名著改編的Old　Curisity　Shop等。</p>
<h3>白玉霜的身世</h3>
<p>— 李麗</p>
<p>誰不知道，白玉霜在上海紅透啦！甚麽「馬寡婦開店，」，「潘金蓮」，眞是人人樂道，個個賞心。尤其白玉霜演風騒旦角，最爲動人，凡看過硼硼戲的人，大槪都相信我的話並不誇張。</p>
<p>不過若講到白玉霜的身世，那眞是十分悽凉，當「五四」之前，她還在天津登台，那時她就在相當的紅啦！無奈她的丈夫，是一個浪蕩子，游手好閒，愛賭，一輸個光；愛喝，一喝個醉，袋裏空了便伸手向白玉霜討錢，所以白玉霜的收入，幾乎十分之七八給這個不掙氣的丈夫消受，而僅餘的十分之二三，要供養她的一位公公，那一個爲了兒子不掙氣，憂愁成病的老翁，還有兩個孩子，簡單說來，白玉霜是負着一家數口的生活。</p>
<p>當時，正是軍閥橫行的時候，有一次白玉霜到某將軍府出堂會，受了一頓侮辱之後，她想盡了方法才逃出了樊籠。不料等她到了家門，她的公公己經氣絕身死，而丈夫却在賭窟裏過着紙醉金迷的生活。</p>
<p>後來，白玉霜因刺激過深，停止登台。就在這當兒，她的丈夫將她的所有的「行頭」出賣了，不久，又將白玉霜兒子價賣，於是在白玉霜的生命史上，給她永久的留下千百條的創痕。</p>
<p>以上是白玉霜在「海棠紅」影片裏所飾的一個悲劇，女主角的身世，不叫白玉霜　叫「海棠紅。」</p>
<h3>二位藝人離滬</h3>
<p>有二位電影藝人於前昨乘滬平通車離滬。於前日離開的是怪物沈西苓，他從廣西回來後，曾成爲一個問題人物，最后的結論是仍回廣西去。可是他眞是一個怪物，他並沒有像人家猜測那麽的，於前日由某旅行社包辦，出了一百五十元乘滬平二等車到北平去遊歷了。這個心願，是他在明星時就許下的，那時他希望明星把欠薪結淸，立刻離開明星到北平去。現在這願望總算給他達到了。據說，他有興子的話，還想到長城去遛跶一下。是的，一個電影導演，像那樣的去庭院歷一下是很有益處的。相信他此后作品的內容一定會更充實的。另外一位是藍蘋，她最近也像西苓那樣成爲問題人物的。最近她正在考慮着進那家公司的時候，忽然接到從山東來的家信，是她母親寄來的信，說她病的厲害，叫藍蘋回去，藍蘋爲了要安慰老年的母親，於昨日乘滬平車去了。此去，大槪將在山東躭擱二星期。那麽樣，上海的問題自然得於二星期後才能解決了。</p>

<h3>To Prevent Smuggling by Land Route, Two Ministries Jointly Formulate Implementation Rules; Regulations for Inspection of Imported Goods in Transit to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to identify smuggled goods among imported goods and to protect the interests of legitimate merchants, both Chinese and foreign, it is reported that the authorities have formulated Provisional Regulations on the Inspection of Imported Goods in Transit, consisting of twenty articles, which will be announced soon. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways, considering that smuggled goods are often transported by land, have jointly formulated seven implementation rules to prevent land smuggling, which have already been filed with the Executive Yuan. An order has been issued to implement them. Regarding maritime transport, an order has also been issued to the coastal customs offices to step up anti-smuggling efforts in accordance with established regulations to prevent any loopholes. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Negotiating Anti-Smuggling Measures; Foreigners Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Because railway inspections of smuggled goods are strict, smugglers are switching to long-distance buses via Dadong to Yuncun, and then dispersing to various places. The Tianjin Customs plans to consult with the Beining-Jinpu Railway Bureau to set up inspection stations along the railway line after the central government's anti-smuggling circular arrives. The Beining Railway, with the exception of the area east of Tanggu, has problems. Five to seven stations will be set up west of Tanggu to Beijing, and three stations will be set up north of Dezhou on the Jinpu Line to Tianjin. Representatives from the British and American consulates and chambers of commerce have continued to visit the customs commissioner in recent days, urging the speedy implementation of strict railway anti-smuggling laws. The American company Mobil Oil, the British company Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco are pressing the matter urgently. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Customs is negotiating with the Beining and Jinpu Railways to promote new anti-smuggling methods. Recently, because the central government issued strict measures, it is no longer necessary to separately negotiate changes to the regulations. It has been decided to wait for the ministry's order before implementing them. Customs sources say that the central government is determined to crack down on smuggling in North China and will use diplomacy as a backup. Customs officers will have the courage to board trains for inspections, doing so without hindering train traffic. Due to rampant smuggling, transportation costs have also been affected. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Customs sources say that since March, a total of 6.3 million bolts of rayon have been transported from eastern Hebei to Tianjin. Of these, 600,000 bolts were smuggled and sold to Lucun, 300,000 bolts to Gaoyang in Hebei, 400,000 bolts to Tianjin, 100,000 bolts to the suburbs of Beijing, and 20,000 bolts to Shanghai. On average, 1.6 million bolts are sold each month. It is currently estimated that 3 million bolts are still stored in a certain concession, enough to sell for two months. 6,000 cases of White Bat petroleum are currently stored in Nandasi and Beidaihe, and 20,000 cases are stored in Tianjin. The market price is 7.2 yuan per case, while the price in Dalian is only 3.7 yuan per case. Therefore, Japanese ronin are transporting large quantities of petroleum to make a profit every day.

<h3>Mongolian Smuggling Affects; National Sugar Sales Nearly Cease</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin's state-run sugar merchants, Minchao and Shantou Sanjing, have seen sugar prices fall to 10 yuan per 100 jin due to the impact of smuggled sugar, having previously fallen to 8 yuan. However, this is still more expensive than the smuggled sugar, which sells for 5 yuan per 100 jin. Seventy merchants have gone out of business, with only thirty remaining. They are all wiring their headquarters to stop shipments. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Minchao and Shantou state-run sugar that used to be sold north through Tianjin, totaling one million bags a year, was already affected by smuggling last year, with sales only reaching 500,000 bags. Recently, sales have been declining, and sales have almost completely ceased. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Gendarmerie; Ordered to Go to Shantou to Suppress Smuggling</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The 17th team of the Provincial Gendarmerie was ordered on the 21st to travel to Shantou by transport to assist in suppressing smuggling. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Government Monitoring Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, the issue of smuggling in northern China was raised for discussion. Conservative MP Sir Lytton and Labour MP Beckett successively questioned the government, saying, "Are the number of Chinese customs anti-smuggling vessels operating within the territorial waters along the demilitarized zone in Hebei Province (as defined by the Tanggu Truce Agreement) restricted by the Japanese authorities? Also, has the British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, raised the difficulties faced by the Chinese authorities in suppressing smuggling with the Japanese government? What was the Japanese government's response?" Foreign Secretary Eden replied, "As far as I know, the number of Chinese customs anti-smuggling vessels operating along the coast of the demilitarized zone is not subject to any restrictions. However, the Japanese military authorities do not allow these vessels to carry weapons in the area, which is the real difficulty. The British government is closely monitoring the situation regarding smuggling in North China. Recently, in view of the difficulties faced by Chinese officials in suppressing smuggling, instructions have been given to the British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, to inform the Japanese government of this situation. The Japanese government replied that there are two reasons why smuggling cannot be suppressed: first, the Chinese government's tariffs are too high; second, the tariff revenue must be handed over to the central government, so local officials are not very interested in protecting this revenue." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The newspaper Pravda commented on the recent rapid increase in Japanese smuggled goods in China, saying, "Japanese smuggled goods not only pose a serious blow to China's foreign trade, but also affect its entire national economy. Customs revenue is drastically reduced, and Chinese goods are being squeezed out by Japanese smuggled goods. This is causing more and more Chinese shops and factories to close down. Japanese smugglers are also greatly harming the trade of Britain and the United States with China, and the smuggling movement is still continuing to develop actively in North China and Fujian. The work currently being done by the Japanese is very clear: to destroy China's entire tariff system and to bring China's market and finances under Japanese control. This smuggling movement is a new way for Japanese imperialists to control China." (21st TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Guizhou Administrative Conference; Scheduled to Be Held in Chengdu</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) The Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters has scheduled a Sichuan-Guizhou administrative conference to be held on June 5th, lasting for ten days.

The nature of the conference will focus on practical issues. The Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters has selected seven key issues to be presented for discussion, in order to serve as the basis for future policies and decrees. President Chiang has recently ordered the appointment of the heads of various departments of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, as well as Kang Ze, Wang Youyong, Li Leifu, and Lei Xiaocen, to serve as special committee members, responsible for the design and lectures on various issues.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Incident of British Troops Invading Jingmao</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Regarding the border dispute between Yunnan and Burma, after repeated negotiations and compromises, a tripartite committee was finally organized to conduct border demarcation. However, the process was stalled midway due to miasma. While the case was still pending, more than two hundred armed British soldiers suddenly invaded Jingmao in Lancang County, Yunnan Province, using disguised missionaries to carry out enticing raids. The border people are simple-minded and lack general knowledge, seeing the bait as something to be taken advantage of, forgetting the difficulty of befriending foreigners, and willing to be incited to intimidate their own kind. The method of their propaganda is to boast of weapons such as long guns and cannons and to confuse people with heterodox theories such as immortal magic, both threatening and coaxing at the same time. It can be said that they have exhausted their ability to carry out actual territorial encroachment. If they are not stopped early, how can the ignorant border people be prevented from colluding with them? This is a major problem that deserves serious attention.</p>
<p>Burma was originally our tributary state, acting as a shield for the southwest. Since India was annexed into the British Empire, Burma was soon seized as well. Because Yunnan Province borders Burma, it has long been the focus of British attention. Taking advantage of border disputes, they have repeatedly tried to expand their power. In the north, there is the Pianma issue, and in the south, there is the Ban Hong incident. The situation is complicated and cannot be resolved overnight. Our national authorities also know that unless a solution is found soon, the ambition of the wolves cannot be suppressed. Therefore, the border demarcation committee was formed, hoping to first demarcate the southern section of the border and then seek a comprehensive solution for the northern section. The painstaking and thoughtful intention cannot be taken lightly. However, in the midst of the border demarcation process, British troops suddenly invaded Jingmao. The incident is bizarre and seems to be threatening us. We believe that a friendly country like Britain, which prides itself on being a civilized leader and extending public justice to the League of Nations, would not allow its people to follow in the footsteps of others and attempt to encroach on and swallow us up by means of brute force. However, the facts show otherwise. How can this not be disheartening?</p>
<p>From this, we can learn two lessons. First, without the efforts of our own country, it will ultimately be difficult to survive in the world. Every cunning country has ambition, so we must maintain the spirit of a brave man closing the door, preserving our isolated corner and not losing it. Expecting sympathy is like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. Second, we should vigorously promote the increase of public wisdom and morality. The summoning of external insults must first have internal moths that are secretly at work, leading wolves into the house and driving fish into the deep, starting from the convenience of seeking private gain, and inevitably resulting in the destruction of the entire country. These unscrupulous and malicious people also include intellectuals, but most of them are ignorant people with short-sighted vision. Universal relief cannot be delayed. Recently, gentry in Lancang County convened a mass meeting to discuss how to deal with the British troops in Jingmao, with the premise of fearing the loss of the border and the goal of ensuring sovereignty. This shows that the morale of the people has not yet been lost and that the border defense can still be repaired. How to curb the deep intrusion of external insults and comfort the longing of the border people depends on the quick action of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Tashiro Convenes Various Officers; Declares the Intentions of the Japanese Military Department; Nagami, Matsumuro, and Others; Detail the Diplomatic Problems of Hebei and Chahar; Visit Uedo to Complete Matters; Imai Returns to Tianjin to Participate in Discussions</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Because Matsumuro sent Tada for an extension of stay in Beijing, at 9:00 AM on the 21st, he responded to Tashiro's summons and went with staff officers Nagami, Ishii, and Hayashi to the Zhangyuan Commander's residence to listen to Tashiro declare the consistent diplomatic intentions of the military department. Nagami, Matsumuro, and others detailed the diplomatic problems of Hebei and Chahar, and the Twenty-Ninth Army's anti-communist deployment. Imai, the military attache of the Beijing embassy, visited Ueda in the morning and then returned to Tianjin to temporarily participate in the discussions. The meeting adjourned at noon. The North China Military Attache Conference is scheduled to be held on the 28th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The brigade commander Kawabe came to Tianjin from Beijing on the night of the 20th to send off Tada. At 7:00 PM on the 21st, the Japanese naval attache Kubota, the consul Kishida, and Japanese residents jointly held a welcome for Tashiro and a farewell banquet for Tada at the public hall, with over two hundred people attending. Tada decided to return to Japan on the morning of the 22nd. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Because Song Zheyuan's throat condition recurred, he rested at his residence under doctor's orders and did not attend the office. The work of the Political Committee is still temporarily handled by Committee Member Liu Zhe. Xiao Zhenying said that he came to visit Song and will return to Tianjin tonight to bid farewell to Tada, who will be returning to his country tomorrow. Tashiro only spoke briefly at the tea party and did not discuss the diplomacy of Hebei and Chahar in detail. The current diplomatic situation is relatively stable, and external rumors are not credible. De Wang's situation is quite difficult, and rumors that he has had changes of heart are false. Song plans to inspect Zhangjiakou with Zhang Zhizhong in the coming days. The issue of smuggling in North China is currently being discussed with various parties to develop strict anti-smuggling measures, which will be implemented once a decision is made. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The director of the Japanese Army Ministry's Ordnance Factory, Lieutenant General Imai Kiyota, met with Tashiro, Tada, Matsumuro, Nagami, and others.

He will return to Tongzhou after sending off Tada on the 22nd. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Charge d'Affaires Wakasugi and Secretary Horiuchi arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai on the evening of the 20th. It has been decided that he will visit Foreign Minister Zhang in the afternoon of the 22nd for a courtesy visit. It is said that Wakasugi will stay in Beijing for three or four days before returning to Shanghai. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As of the 21st, there has been no response to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest to Japan over smuggling in Hebei and its request for restraint, and Ambassador Xu's negotiations with Japan over the increase of Japanese troops in North China. Japanese Charge d'Affaires Wakasugi and Counselor Horiuchi arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 21st, but have not made any statements to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that the new ambassador, Kawagoe, will leave Japan on June 1st to take up his post in China. Wakasugi is here to handle embassy affairs and will return to Shanghai in a few days.

<h3>Chinese Creditors Oppose; Japanese Purchase of Yuyuan Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yuyuan Cotton Mill is being sold to the Japanese Zhongfang Textile Company. Chinese creditors are opposing it because the total debt of the mill, including interest, is 7 million yuan, of which only 3 million is owed to Japanese creditors, with interest accounting for 1.2 million. When the shareholders liquidated the mill last year, the Japanese side stated that if a decision was made to repay the debt, the interest could be discounted. Now the Chinese creditors believe that if the mill is sold, those with more debts have the priority to purchase or offset the debt. They have hired a lawyer to negotiate with the shareholders. The mill foundation's custodian committee is also temporarily under the supervision of the Chinese creditors. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>South Manchuria Railway Manages; North China Highway Transportation; Long-Distance Bus Transportation Company Established; Plans to Establish Eight Bus Routes Including Beijing-Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin South Manchuria Railway Office has established a North China Long-Distance Bus Transportation Company, managed by Xi, the bus section chief of the office. On the 21st, they forcefully took over the Tientsin-Tangshan line run by the private Shuigu Long-Distance Bus Company. The company, which has been operating for one year, runs passenger and freight services between Tianjin and Tangshan, with eight buses and an average monthly profit of 500 yuan. The South Manchuria Railway paid only 24,000 yuan for the buses. Miao Xijiu, the manager of Yonggu, came to Tianjin to appeal to the authorities. The South Manchuria Railway also plans to establish eight bus routes, including Beijing-Zhangjiakou, which are scheduled to be opened within a month. Ota, the director of the office, went to Dalian earlier to request instructions on the construction of roads and the North China transportation network, and returned to Tianjin on the 21st to proceed with the plan.

<h3>Xu Shiying; Resignation Is Entirely Groundless</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese-language newspaper in Shanghai, published a news article stating "Ambassador Xu Shiying to Japan Expresses Intention to Resign," claiming that it was a recent confirmed report from the Chinese side. The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reprinted it. As Ambassador Xu is currently working hard to adjust relations between the two countries and is negotiating with the Japanese authorities on issues such as smuggling and the increase of Japanese troops in North China, this rumor in the Japanese newspaper is extremely alarming.

<h3>Prohibition of Employees of Various Railways from Transporting Drugs; Ministry of Railways Handles Joint Guarantee and Joint Responsibility; Regulations Have Been Promulgated by the Anti-Smoking Association; Railway Bureaus Should Complete Implementation Within Three Months</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Smoking Association promulgated the Ministry of Railways' Regulations on Joint Guarantee and Joint Responsibility for the Prohibition of Employees and Police from Privately Transporting Drugs. The main points are as follows: (1) Employees and police officers should join in pairs to guarantee each other that they will not privately transport drugs. If any one person is found to be privately transporting drugs, the guarantor will be held jointly responsible. Each person can only join one guarantee and should be of the same rank. (2) If a guarantor knows that any one person in the guarantee is privately transporting drugs, they should secretly report it. If the report is verified, the informant will be exempt from joint liability and can find another guarantor. (3) If a person in the guarantee suspects another person in the guarantee, they can declare withdrawal from the guarantee. After the withdrawal, the original three people should find another guarantor within ten days. (4) If any person in the guarantee resigns, is dismissed, promoted, demoted, transferred, or dies, their guarantors should find another guarantor within ten days. (5) After the implementation of these regulations, the railway bureaus should complete the process within three months and submit the guarantee registers to the ministry for filing. Those who continue the guarantee should report to the ministry at any time. Those who fail to provide a guarantee in accordance with the regulations beyond the deadline will be deemed to be resisting orders and will be suspended from their duties.

<h3>Remnant Bandits in Northern Shaanxi Heavily Besieged on Three Sides</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) The military situation regarding the suppression of the Red Army after the remnant bandits from Shanxi returned to northern Shaanxi is decisive. Earlier, in late April, the remnant bandits roamed in Yonghe, Xi County, and Daning in Shanxi. There were no large groups of remnant bandits on the west bank of the Yellow River. The original plan was to eliminate them all in Shanxi. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd of this month, the remnant bandits crossed the river west of Yujiazui in Yonghe, missing an interception opportunity. Now, the bandit forces are largely gathered in their old nests in Yanchuan, Yanchang, Yongpingzhen, and Wayaobao in northern Shaanxi. Heavy troops are now deployed in Ganquan, Fuxian, Luochuan, Yichuan, Jingjian, and Suide to form a three-sided encirclement from the west, south, and north, advancing steadily. At the same time, efforts are being made to handle post-recovery affairs in the recaptured areas, with the aim of thoroughly eliminating them in the short term.

<h3>Britain, France, and Italy All Waiting for the Moment; European Situation Temporarily Quiet; Future French Premier Blum Becomes the Center of the Situation; Mussolini Wants to Negotiate and Define British and French Rights</h3>
<p>(London) The leader of the French Socialist Party, Blum, will succeed Sarraut in early June to organize a new government. According to informed sources, the British government decided today that it will postpone making major decisions on the diplomatic policies to be adopted in the near future until the new French government is formed. After listening to Foreign Secretary Eden's report on the European political situation, the Cabinet meeting only decided to maintain the current sanctions against Italy and the fleet currently concentrated in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the French political circles expressed sympathy for the proposal that Mediterranean countries and Britain conclude mutual assistance agreements, but it must include Italy. However, since Italy has now openly annexed Abyssinia, France, like Britain, is unwilling to negotiate with Italy. It is reported that Mussolini has expressed to France his willingness to start negotiations on British rights in Lake Tana and French rights in the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway as soon as possible, and also promised not to recruit black troops. It is reported that Yugoslavia and Greece are very uneasy because Italy has shown signs of actively operating in Albania. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet has made no statement on foreign policy issues in recent days. There are three reasons for this: The autonomous regions have not yet clearly expressed their opinions on the issue of sanctions against Italy; The new French Cabinet has not yet been formed; Germany has not yet responded to the British question raised on May 4. So far, regarding the first item, opinions from the autonomous regions vary widely. South African Federal Prime Minister Hertzog and Justice Minister Smuts have both issued statements advocating maintaining the current sanctions and implementing the principle of collective security. In the Australian Federation, the opinions are obviously the opposite. During a recent informal gathering of parliamentarians from various parties in the country, Prosecutor Menzies clearly declared that the current sanctions should be lifted. The differences in opinions among the autonomous regions are evident. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report in Tongwen Daily today, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi has received instructions from Mussolini regarding Anglo-Italian relations. The newspaper believes that timely and calm discussions can lead to progress in relations between the two countries. Therefore, preparations are being made to guarantee that the power of the Roman Empire will not be extended to North Africa and to withdraw the white troops stationed in Libya as proof. Mussolini is now also prepared to formally announce that he has no designs on Palestine and Egypt if Britain recognizes Italy's victory in Abyssinia. It is said that Mussolini is eager to restore Anglo-Italian friendship as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Paris, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi has received a special instruction from Mussolini to consult with the British government on resolving the overall situation in Abyssinia. Today, the Italian Embassy here has denied it. It is said that the Italian government will not put forward any new proposals before the new government of the French Socialist Party takes office on June 2. Furthermore, British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond is currently on a week-long vacation at Lake Como, indicating that there will be no major developments in diplomacy for the time being.

<p>(Paris) The future Prime Minister Léon Blum met with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol this morning. The discussions likely involved the international situation and the convening of an extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Suvich met with French Ambassador Chambrun today, presumably to discuss the international situation. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The future Prime Minister Léon Blum, together with the current Prime Minister Sarraut, Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Leire, discussed the international situation today for two hours. Peng Gu reported the situation to Foreign Minister Flandin via long-distance telephone. According to semi-official sources, this conversation was purely advisory and was intended to allow Léon Blum to have a sufficient understanding of the diplomatic situation before taking office as Premier. This correspondent recently learned from reliable sources that Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu will contact the countries concerned regarding the new situation in the Italian-Albanian issue and the Locarno case before the new cabinet is formed, in order to prepare for attending the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council (June 16). Furthermore, Léon Blum has asked former Prime Minister Herriot to serve as the Foreign Minister of the new cabinet, but has been declined. However, Léon Blum will still persuade Herriot to reluctantly accept. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the future Prime Minister Léon Blum discussed the international situation with the current Prime Minister Sarraut, Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Leire, various newspapers stated that the conversations revealed that the diplomatic situation, even if not serious, was very tense. With the date of the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council (June 16) approaching, relations between Britain and Italy are very tense, and the situation in Austria is also uneasy. Such situations require immediate action to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. Xiao Bali Ribao reported, "The three countries of Britain, France, and Italy should immediately exchange views on the program for resolving the Italian-Albanian issue and on Italy's willingness to cooperate with European countries. Otherwise, Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations will become an irreversible fact. "In that case, Italy will tend towards Germany and Hungary and will sooner or later establish a fascist barrier between the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, with a population of one million, dividing the democratic Middle European and forcing France to separate from its reliable allies. The danger is imaginable." Shiye Ribao published an article by the famous journalist Madame Tabuyi, stating, "The Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries are now expecting the major powers' foreign policies to crystallize in order to determine their own policies to correspond with them. These countries regard the understanding between Britain and France as their only support." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) King Leopold III of Belgium suddenly arrived in Britain by plane from Brussels tonight. After arriving at Lympne Airport, he drove to Kent, but his destination was kept secret. It is rumored that the purpose of the King's visit was to visit British politicians in order to find a way to ease the tense relations between Britain and Italy. King Leopold has family ties with Italy (the wife of the Italian Crown Prince is the King's sister). Before King George V of Britain was seriously ill at the end of last year, Leopold also visited Britain, and it was widely rumored that he was entrusted by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy to mediate between Britain and Italy. Now, this theory has resurfaced. It is reported that the Italian government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Grandi, to notify Britain that Italy's imperialist ambitions have been satisfied after the capture of Abyssinia and that there are no more extravagant hopes. Although the Italian Embassy has not confirmed this statement, political figures believe that Italy's attitude in easing Anglo-Italian relations must be this. The development of the Anglo-Italian situation is of great importance, so these individuals are now extremely concerned and paying close attention to it. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Declares that Egypt is Inviolable; Interference Will Be Considered an Unfriendly Act</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin made an important statement in the House of Commons today regarding Britain's policy in the Middle and Near East. A Labor MP asked the government whether it would clearly announce, in response to Italy's annexation of the entire territory of Abyssinia and the resulting threat to Britain's position in the Middle and Near East, that in any case, Italy must not interfere with the existing political situation in Egypt and Palestine; that if Italy has such intentions, Britain will regard it as an unfriendly act and take measures to deal with it. The MP also asked whether the government would consult with the Egyptian government on consolidating British defenses in the Suez Canal region in light of the development of the air force. Baldwin's reply mentioned the Egyptian issue, stating that in March 1922, the British government had notified all foreign countries, including Italy, that Britain had decided to abolish Egypt's status as a British protectorate and recognize it as an independent country, and in very clear terms, declared that any attempt by any country to interfere with Egyptian affairs would be regarded by the British government as an unfriendly act; that Britain would use all its strength to resist anyone who invaded Egyptian territory. Since this statement has already been made, there is no need to repeat it today. As for the Suez Canal, the British government is currently conducting preliminary talks in Cairo with the aim of negotiating a British-Egyptian alliance, which will include the protection of the canal. As for Palestine, Britain has the responsibility for administration and protection under the mandate and will fulfill its obligations with all its strength. The British government has notified overseas autonomous regions of all these circumstances in detail. The audience cheered greatly upon hearing this. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, an MP inquired whether the recent activities of the Italian military attache at the Italian Embassy in Britain warranted a recommendation to the Italian government that he be recalled. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that he had stated in the House of Commons on Monday that someone had forged evidence, falsely accusing Britain of supplying illegal munitions to the Ethiopian army, and he believed that his remarks were sufficient to protect the British government and British manufacturers from further defamation. Under these circumstances, he did not wish to take any action against the Italian military attache. At the same time, someone also inquired about the status of the Ethiopian Emperor and the Ethiopian authorities. The Foreign Secretary replied that he knew that the British Consul in Gore, Ethiopia, was now in contact with them, and the Ethiopian authorities were currently maintaining order in the western part of Ethiopia, which had not been occupied by Italian forces. The Ethiopian Emperor's freedom of movement was not subject to any restrictions, and there would be no direct or indirect pressure to prevent him from coming to Britain, but he would not be allowed to engage in continued warfare while in Britain.

<h3>Italy Asks Britain and France to Withdraw Troops Stationed in Abyssinia; Britain Does Not Allow the Request</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the Italian government is now requesting Britain and France to withdraw the troops stationed in Abyssinia to protect their own nationals. This has been raised verbally and informally in order to avoid complicating the complex status of foreign embassies in Addis Ababa. The troops referred to are a contingent of Indian soldiers who have strengthened the normal guard at the British Embassy and 150 soldiers sent by the French authorities to Diredawa to protect railway property. It is reported that the Italian government believes that there is no need for these extra troops to be stationed in Addis Ababa since the Italian army has restored order in Abyssinia, and therefore made this request. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government has made representations to Britain requesting the withdrawal of the Indian guard attached to the British Embassy in Abyssinia. Political figures here recently stated that what Italy has raised is not a formal demand, but a suggestion, which has been made three times: General Badoglio, the governor of Abyssinia, has expressed this intention to Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia; Italian Foreign Minister Suvich has mentioned it to British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond; Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi has mentioned it to the Foreign Office. The British government clearly does not want to accept this. This guard will remain stationed for some time. Foreign Secretary Eden may make a statement on this matter when the House of Commons meets this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Expeditionary Force Returns Home to Deal with the European Situation; To Be Consulted by Mussolini</h3>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa and the current Governor of Abyssinia, departed from Addis Ababa at noon today for Asmara, intending to return home for a vacation. He will likely remain in the country until the danger of war caused by the implementation of sanctions against Italy by the member states of the League of Nations has disappeared, and then return to his post. It is now believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini wants Badoglio by his side so that he can consult with him at any time. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from Addis Ababa, General Graziani arrived in Addis Ababa at ten o'clock this morning from Harar. Later, General Badoglio took a plane to Iritrea and boarded a ship with his wife and daughter to return home. He is expected to arrive here on the 27th. Badoglio's trip is the result of major developments in the European situation, such as the League of Nations' failure to relax sanctions against Italy, the withdrawal of Italy's representative from Geneva, the fall of Austrian Starhemberg, and the expansion of Schuschnigg's power. The recent deterioration in Anglo-Italian relations and Rome's newspapers openly discussing the inevitability of a European war have made Badoglio's return home a matter of great concern to the general public. (Guomin dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that there will be important amendments to the Italian constitution, and some important members of the Fascist Party will be promoted to important positions. One aspect of the constitutional amendment is the abolition of the existing House of Representatives and the establishment of a corporate parliament, which Prime Minister Mussolini had announced on March 23 and is now about to be implemented. Political figures also stated that the Italian constitution, which was promulgated in 1861, will not be abolished by the Fascist government, but the Fascist Party may soon formulate its own constitution, which will deal with the issue of the powers of Prime Minister Mussolini, which were temporarily stipulated in a law promulgated on December 24, 1925, and must now be confirmed. As for the promotion of members of the Fascist Party, some important figures previously went to Africa to serve in the military and have now returned home, such as Count Ciano, the Prime Minister's son-in-law and Minister of Propaganda, and Farinacci, the former Secretary of the Fascist Party, or will soon return home, such as Botai, the former Minister of Corporate Affairs (currently the Civil Administrator of Addis Ababa). It is generally believed that these individuals, who have made great contributions in foreign lands, will be appointed to important positions. The Prime Minister himself originally held several positions concurrently, but may in the future vacate some of these concurrent positions for meritorious personnel. In addition, the Italian economic organization will undergo major changes as a result of the measures taken to resist sanctions. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party has decided to continue to resist sanctions, and economic relations with countries participating in sanctions will not be restored to their original state. Experts claim that since Italy has been subject to sanctions, the total volume of foreign trade has decreased significantly, but imports have also decreased, which is beneficial to Italy. These are just rumors, but have not been confirmed by officials. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Red Cross Rescue Team Leaves Abyssinia; All British Nationals Go to the Military Station to See Them Off</h3>
<p>(Addis Ababa) The British Red Cross rescue team, which made great contributions to the wounded soldiers of Ethiopia during the Italo-Ethiopian War, departed from Addis Ababa today to return home. All British nationals went to the train station to see them off. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) A man named Penner, who is a British subject and served in the Abyssinian Red Cross, was suddenly arrested by the Italian military authorities and disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia, has submitted a report to the Foreign Office describing the incident. According to the report, Penner, having been bitten by a rabid dog, was unable to find serum within Ethiopia and boarded a train from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, French Somaliland, intending to travel to Aden, a British colony, for treatment. When he arrived at Dire Dawa station, the British Consul in Harar happened to be there, and Penner got off the train to meet him. Unexpectedly, he was arrested by the Italian army and could not continue his journey. The British Consul in Harar made representations to the Italian military authorities, demanding his release so that he could go to Djibouti as soon as possible. The Italian military authorities replied that Penner was in the Ethiopian army and had to be detained. After the Consul returned to Harar, he wrote to the Italian military authorities in Dire Dawa again, inquiring about what they intended to do with Penner. The Italian military authorities replied that the person had disappeared and his whereabouts were unknown. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>A Secret Government is Indeed Established in Western Abyssinia; Italian Forces Penetrate Deeper into the Interior</h3>
<p>(London) Dr. Martin, the Ethiopian Minister to Britain, recently wrote a letter on behalf of the "Regent Government" of Ethiopia, which was reprinted by The Times, stating, "The Regent Government has been established in the western part of Ethiopia, which has not been occupied by Italian forces. The exact location and the person in charge are not to be disclosed to avoid Italian aircraft bombing and dropping toxic gas bombs. Even Ethiopians who are suspected of communicating with the Regent Government have been arrested and executed by the military authorities without trial. However, it would be unfair to ask the Ethiopian Regent Government to prove its legal status, except through the Emperor, who acts as an intermediary and liaises with the outside world. However, we are now in communication with the Regent Government and have learned that it is now focusing on comforting refugees, saving lives, and healing the wounded. Since Addis Ababa was occupied, it has fallen into terror, and hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled westward. The Regent Government should settle and provide relief to them."

<p>(Addis Ababa) Italian forces have occupied the city of Debra Markos, the capital of the Gojjam province of Ethiopia. The city is an ancient fortress and holy city of Abyssinia. It is expected that Italian forces will be able to completely control the province within days. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news from Addis Ababa, the troops under the command of General Starace, the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party, have occupied Debra Markos, the capital of the Gojjam province. General Starace, along with several officers, arrived there by plane and raised the Italian flag on the roof of the Imperial Palace. A large number of infantry also entered the city. General Imru, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route of Ethiopia, and various chieftains have surrendered to the Italian army. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Naval Talks; No Major Difficulties</h3>

<h3>Japan's Reply Drafted: Acknowledges British Proposal to Increase Destroyer Tonnage by 40,000 Tons</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government, through Acting Ambassador Fujii, proposed to the Japanese government on the 6th of this month to increase destroyer tonnage by 40,000 tons. The Japanese government's reply, after careful consultation between the navy and foreign affairs authorities for several days, was finalized on the 21st and will be delivered to the British government by Acting Ambassador Fujii today or tomorrow. The content of the reply generally acknowledges the British request, but the Japanese government must reserve the right to abolish destroyers and submarines as a price. (21st Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy regarding the issue of cruiser and destroyer holdings by the British, it was decided to send a reply to the British government through the acting ambassador in Britain in the coming days. The content roughly stated that the London Treaty should expire in December of this year, but Japan, out of international good faith, will naturally abide by the treaty. Naval Minister Nagano has already stated this intention in the House of Representatives Budget Subcommittee. Japan cannot agree with Britain's statement that it has been greatly affected by changes in the surrounding circumstances. Furthermore, Japan cannot acknowledge Britain's desire to preserve warships that should be scrapped. Concessions between Class A and Class B cruisers and increasing training ships are clearly in violation of the treaty. However, if Britain considers this matter unavoidable, Japan does not wish to interfere further. However, the Japanese Navy also believes that the current quantity stipulated by the treaty cannot cope with the international situation, nor can it strengthen national defense as a force for stability in East Asia. Therefore, it will temporarily reserve the right to independently establish necessary armaments. (21st Associated Press)</p>

He will likely travel there next Monday with the Queen Mother and his younger brother. The ship is now fully prepared for its first voyage across the Atlantic. Its average speed is 34 knots per hour, which is the highest speed currently achieved by merchant ships. Last June, the new French liner "Normandie" spent four days, three hours, and five minutes traveling from England to New York, setting a new record for Atlantic voyages. It is believed that the Queen Mary will surpass this record. (21st Reuters)</p>
<h3>Palestine Continues to Have Serious Riots, British Government Organizes Commission to Investigate</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: One day of British soldiers parading through various villages and towns displaying their military might brought relative peace, but today, riots have broken out again throughout Palestine. According to government gazettes, shooting incidents have occurred in Acre, Dajun, Qiran, and other towns. The most serious riots were seen in Jaffa, where bombs were thrown at a police station, damaging many window panes. Night travel is prohibited along the railway lines throughout Palestine. At the same time, the British government is busy organizing a Royal Commission to investigate the main causes of the current riots and the grievances of the Jewish people, without involving the issue of the Palestine Mandate. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: After the Arab strike and market closure, merchant ships arriving at the port of Jaffa could not unload their cargo. It was not until yesterday that permission was granted by the government to unload the cargo in Tel Aviv. Arab sailors and dockworkers strongly opposed this move and protested to the authorities, stating that the government should be held responsible if any disturbances arise as a result. However, the situation yesterday was calm. All public institutions are currently guarded by troops for precautionary measures. Since the outbreak of conflict between the Jewish and Arab communities, the number of arrests has been 814 Arabs and 53 Jews. (21st Havas)</p>

<h3>Following Currency Negotiations, China and the US Engage on Trade Issues, The Chinese Embassy in the US Is Responsible for Negotiations, Agreement Could Be Reached in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today from reliable sources that the Chinese Embassy is currently negotiating with the US Export-Import Bank on the issue of financing trade between China and the United States. An agreement could be reached in two weeks. The Chinese side is fully responsible for these negotiations through the embassy, and thus it is unrelated to the delegation negotiating the Sino-US silver agreement. The fact that the two negotiations are taking place at the same time is a mere coincidence. It is also learned that the US Export-Import Bank has considered various plans to assist in the export of railway materials to China. However, bank officials declined to comment on whether these plans are related to the current negotiations. (20th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>New York: Unofficial telegrams from Shanghai reporting the terms of the Sino-US financial agreement have left experts here today rather confused and unable to grasp the truth. According to these reports, the US Treasury is prepared to purchase 75 million ounces of silver at a price of 45 cents. However, some circles here believe that this move will give China $33.75 million in credit, which is more than the recently rumored $25 million from the Chinese side. Other circles here have received news from China stating that the US Treasury is only willing to purchase 50 million ounces of silver. (20th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Heroin Production, Huge Quantities Shipped to China Last Year, Mostly from Japan, League of Nations Narcotics Committee Meeting, US Representative Fuller Presents Report</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to a statement issued today by U.S. Representative Fuller to the League of Nations Opium Committee, in 1935, enough acetic anhydride was imported into China to produce 30 to 60 times more heroin than the world's legal uses. The amount of this chemical legally imported into China that year totaled 31,900 kilos, of which 26,700 kilos came from Japan. The number of those secretly imported is not included. In that year, there was also a factory in Shanghai that manufactured this product, with an annual production capacity of as much as 250,000 kilos. Legal commercial transactions in this chemical in China are now almost extinct. In addition, the report of the Confiscation Subcommittee released today stated that representatives from the United States and Canada provided conclusive evidence proving that existing organized agencies are transporting narcotics to the United States and Canada. The Japanese authorities have not been able to ascertain how legally manufactured narcotics in Japan fall into the hands of smugglers, and Japanese courts impose very light sentences on Japanese individuals convicted of smuggling, so it is impossible to curb this. The report further stated that it has long been requested that the Japanese government enact strict punishment laws and stated that much of the heroin imported into China is transported from Dalian.

<p>(London) Several European financial institutions are currently negotiating with representatives of several Chinese provinces, including Sichuan, Xikang, and Qinghai, hoping to promote Sino-foreign trade relations through the exchange of goods. It is understood that these negotiations began three years ago, when several German industrialists and Dutch financiers had already formed a syndicate and took the lead in this endeavor, but it did not achieve satisfactory results, and the original plan was suspended. Towards the end of 1935, the German and Dutch syndicates revived the old plan and began negotiations. It is rumored that it has obtained the endorsement of the Japanese government. However, because the negotiations proceeded very slowly, Dutch financiers no longer felt interested and transferred their participating shares to a syndicate jointly formed by Britain and Belgium. It is generally believed that these negotiations are currently being held in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, with the aim of finding a compromise basis in order to establish a transaction. Once the matter is completed, all related countries can participate in the development of resources in various places in China, and promote the large-scale transport of timber, ore, and vegetable oil seeds produced there to Europe.

<h3>International Labour Conference to Open on June 4th</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the opening of the 20th International Labour Conference on June 4th, the Director of the International Labour Office, Mr. Butler, will present the annual report on the state of the world economy in the past year. The content is extremely bleak. Mr. Butler, while acknowledging the positive phenomena that have occurred in the economies of certain countries, such as increased industrial production, higher prices, and reduced unemployment, believes that these phenomena are not so much due to international economic recovery as to the self-reorganization of various countries. Regarding the increase in production, it is clearly due to rearmament. "Industrial prosperity based primarily on war preparations is illusory. The munitions manufacturing industry cannot truly increase a country's resources." Mr. Butler also concluded that the world economy is supported by the national genius of various countries, the causes are mutually dependent, and cannot be achieved by separate reorganization by various countries. It must be adjusted internationally to be of practical benefit. (21st Havas)</p>

<p>(Vienna) After Prime Minister Schuschnigg decided to abolish various paramilitary groups and reorganize them into civic guards, the Council of State drafted an alternate legal order yesterday to stipulate the reorganization methods. The full text has not yet been released.

<p>(Tokyo) The Military Police Chiefs Conference was held at the Minister of Justice's residence on the morning of the 21st, and Chief Prosecutor Mitsuyuki delivered instructions. The main points are recorded as follows: The current situation in our country, both internal and external, is extremely serious, and the degree of tension or relaxation of criminal administration is of great importance to the rise and fall of the national fortune. Therefore, those engaged in prosecution should correct domestic order, devote all of their abilities to the country and society, and regard this as the primary task. The extermination of anarchism and the communist movement should continue to be strictly investigated in order to eliminate the possibility of their resurgence. Recently, the social situation has undergone drastic changes, so it is necessary to eliminate radical actions at any time and strengthen the people's concept of obedience. Taking advantage of the current high tide of the nationalist movement, efforts must be made to eliminate disturbances in social order. Thoroughly examine the content of religious beliefs, and if there is any violation of regulations, appropriate measures must be taken to correct current malpractices. All acts of dereliction of duty and corruption of discipline should be prevented and impeached to avoid decline. With regard to domestic affairs and criminal phenomena arising from the international situation, various crimes with ideological backgrounds are not only large in organization, but also linked to military affairs. There are real cases of overt and daring actions against extremist crimes. Therefore, liaison and cooperation between various search agencies is absolutely necessary. (21st Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Austria in Crisis (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lauis Fisher from the work of Lauis Fisher</p>
<p>When Mussolini mobilized at the Brenner Pass to quell the Nazi uprising in July 1934, his policy toward Austria could be said to have been completed, with the only missing piece being an authoritarian government. Yet, it remains a government without power. According to estimates by keen observers, in Austria, one-third are Social Democrats and Communists, one-third are Catholic Socialists, and 30 percent are National Socialists; the remaining large segment, only three or two percent, would be willing to elect Schuschnigg, if they could vote. The Schuschnigg cabinet is backed by the guns of the Heimwehr of Starhemberg, a kind of informal military organization. Starhemberg is a large landowner, and these troops are either supplied by him or supported by profits from Italian arms shipments to Hungary. Mussolini naturally detested the Social Democrats, so when the Austrian Social Democrats interfered with Italian-Hungarian arms trade, they were outlawed. Thus, in Austria today, there is no parliament, no political parties, no popular support, no freedom of the press, and no labor unions. It only has terror, long-term imprisonment, and arbitrary opening of foreign travelers' letters. Austria's political "independence" can be explained by her economic "independence." Her important industries are ice skates, musical instruments, etc., and now even goods that break sanctions. No one would want Starhemberg or Schuschnigg to displease Mussolini. However, exports to Italy are limited by Italy's purchasing power. Austria can export her abundant timber and papermaking materials to Italy. However, she cannot continue to import raw materials for cash and then export them to Italy in exchange for lire or fruit. This is tantamount to Austria extending credit to Italy, which will inevitably lead to the loss of hard currency reserves, making it difficult for Austria to sustain herself. Soon, Italy will essentially be sanctioning itself. In recent months, the transit taxes on Czech and German goods exported to Italy, which Austria earns for not participating in sanctions, are considerable. The economic situation in 1935 appears to have improved, but this is mostly superficial. Official unemployment statistics are unreliable. The streets of Vienna are filled with scenes of poverty, and the government is posting notices urging the public to provide relief to the starving old and young. Surrounded by heavy tariff barriers within a narrow territory, Austria's economic future is truly bleak and difficult to put on track.</p>
<p>To cope with this predicament, Viennese politicians are playing a pointless farce. They want to prevent Germany's annexation by restoring the Habsburg monarchy. Many, however, believe that this would only promote German-Austrian unification. However, its importance is not as great as the resolute opposition of the Little Entente, backed by France, to Archduke Otto or any other royal family member's restoration. Italy has not done much to prevent Austria's tendency toward restoration. This has further deepened the hatred of the Czechs and Yugoslavs toward the Habsburg succession, because these two countries foresee that: first, Italy and the Habsburgs may unite to reclaim Croatia from Yugoslavia; second, the Austro-Hungarian union will weaken the Little Entente's power; they are all anti-Hungarian because Hungary wants to reclaim the land that was ceded to them in the peace treaty; third, the Habsburgs will promote destructive conspiracies in the three irreconcilable countries of the Little Entente—Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The Little Entente opposes the Habsburg restoration even more than German-Austrian unification, but both are things they will try to prevent with all their might. The inflexible nobles and the corrupt remnants of the royal family, having been rejected by their Otto, are only trying to persuade various cities to elect him as their honorary citizen. Many cities have already taken this step, and for the rest, they can only hope, because besides that, they have no other way. Starhemberg is only thirty-six years old, handsome, passionate, and has ulterior motives. He is likely to become the regent of the Habsburgs. However, a regent does not necessarily step down immediately to give way to the crown prince; Horthy (the regent of Hungary - translator's note) has been regent for many years. A vice-chancellor can resign at any time. A regent, however, is mostly appointed for life. Such a development is possible. The Little Entente cannot oppose it either.</p>
<p>One should not overemphasize the current rulers of Austria. Their refusal to expand the base of their narrow political structure is at least due to the illusion of the beautiful crown, which is truly a tragic and perhaps dangerous game. The only way for Austria to free herself from the two fascist states of Italy and Germany and realize the empty slogan of Austria's independence today is to establish a democratic government. This is what the Little Entente ultimately sympathizes with, and they are doing their best to promote it. The Pope may also approve, because he fears that Germany's anti-Catholic policies will be transplanted to this only Catholic country in Central Europe.</p>
<p>Dictatorship is Austria's weakness. It makes the country surrender into the embrace of foreign dictators. Austria's tranquility in recent years has mostly been based on the opposition of the two fascists. But now that Italy is busy with Abyssinia and the Mediterranean, why doesn't Germany take this opportunity to annex Austria? Yes, recently the Austrian and German National Socialists have not been very active within Austria. They seem to have retreated, although Mussolini has hinted that he will tolerate Germany's annexation of Austria to threaten Britain and France. Germany's current inaction toward Austria is actually a very serious matter in Europe. Although things may ease due to shifts in the situation among the great powers, the influence Austria has on the world is ultimately too great. The reason why Germany does not seize the opportunity is the difficulties within Hitler's regime. Hitler knows that Austria is a fuse that could ignite a European conflagration, so he cleverly suppresses it for the time being to avoid such a crisis.</p>
<p>When Germany's desires seem to have subsided slightly, Britain's power rises. Central and Southeastern Europe are now looking to Britain as their ally. These countries have not abandoned France, but are only deeply afraid that France has a tendency to abandon them. However, unless the internal political structure can meet the needs of the country and the wishes of the people, the power of Britain or [France] is not likely to be solid and reliable, and foreign investment is not safe.

<h3>Advocating One Name Per Person, Wu Dingchang Requests Amendment of Civil Code and Company Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Realizing that a person's name is exclusively used by that person, and is the embodiment of their identity with respect to rights and obligations, Minister Wu Dingchang believes that if a person has several names, the meaning of exclusivity will be obscured, and legal protection will not be easy. Moreover, disputes often arise when legal issues occur. Therefore, at a recent Executive Yuan meeting, he proposed amending Article 19 of the Civil Code and Article 115 of the Company Law. The proposal was passed at the meeting and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Wu argues that a person should only have one name and that it should be based on household registration. Otherwise, it cannot be the subject of rights and obligations. Even movable and immovable property should be registered under the name recorded in the household registration, otherwise it will not have legal effect. This will ensure that rights and obligations are determined. Any name not recorded in the household registration, or any name changed arbitrarily without going through the procedure of applying for a name change, should not be used to assert the right to a name, so as to eliminate all disputes and remove all ambiguities.

<h3>Diplomatic Office of Guangdong and Guangxi Protests Guangzhouwan Case</h3>
<p>Harsh taxes and the collection of poll taxes are the root cause of the incident. France mistakenly treats leased territory as equivalent to a colony, contradicting the spirit of the Washington Conference.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Guangzhouwan government's handling of the petition for exemption from poll taxes has resulted in a tragic incident of Vietnamese soldiers shooting civilians due to improper measures. Over 200,000 overseas Chinese in the area are outraged. In addition to sending representatives to Guangzhou to petition and negotiate with various levels of government, demanding that the local government punish the perpetrators and provide compensation, they are also preparing for serious action. It is reported that the Guangzhouwan government is considering a solution to this incident to maintain the security of the leased territory. The local Deputy Commissioner has gone to handle future matters. As for the Diplomatic Office of Guangdong and Guangxi, after receiving the petition from the Guangzhouwan people's representatives on the 16th requesting negotiations, it immediately drafted a letter of protest and submitted it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day to negotiate with the French ambassador to China. The original text of the letter of protest is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Guangzhouwan people's petition, "Guangzhouwan was leased to France for management in the 25th year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty. When the French first entered the area, the collection of land taxes was not too heavy, and various taxes were also relatively light, which showed fairness in the government's policies. However, later the extortion became heavier and heavier. Not only were taxes levied on everything, but they also increased year by year. Now the land tax has increased by thirty times, and the commercial boat license tax and fishing tax have increased by twenty times. Even when merchants are involved in official matters, they are fined at will, lightly for several yuan, and heavily for dozens of yuan. Recently, street market taxes have also been levied in various towns, and no matter how cheap the items, a few cents of silver are extracted. Recently, a public order has been issued, ordering men from twenty-one to fifty years old to register in the bureau and report. Each man must fulfill three days of mandatory labor. If they cannot work, they must pay four dimes of Western silver per day, or one dollar and two dimes for three days. They say that mandatory labor is equivalent to a poll tax. Because the local people are poor and have suffered from frequent famines in recent years, poll taxes will inevitably increase, and the people will not be able to bear it, which will lead to displacement and migration. It is feared that the barren land of Guangzhouwan will be uninhabited. They are forced to pour out their true feelings and respectfully request Your Excellency to use public law to negotiate, so that the government's policies can be abolished. The people of Guangzhouwan will be forever grateful for the great kindness." Attached is a copy of the tax regulations, totaling fourteen articles, received by the office. Furthermore, according to the telegram from Chen Bao and others, representatives of the Guangzhouwan refugees, "Guangzhouwan has been leased to France since 1900. Now, the French authorities are implementing the laws implemented in Annam in Guangzhouwan, intending to levy a poll tax on the people and ordering the villages to quickly report strong men. Therefore, the councilors of Potou villages, representing the people, tearfully appealed to the French authorities, asking them to consider the people's suffering due to the famine this year and to postpone the implementation. Unexpectedly, they provoked the anger of the Potou camp officer of the French government, who fired guns to threaten them and detained four people. Then, he ordered the Public Security Bureau under his jurisdiction to arrest three wealthy councilors from each district within one day and hand them over for punishment. He also sent troops to station in Tiantou village to demonstrate and intimidate. As a result, men and women fled, and chickens and dogs were restless. On the day, our compatriots were forced to go to the Potou camp officer to petition for the exemption of poll taxes and the withdrawal of troops. They were shot and killed by the French Public Security Bureau, killing Li Shaofu, Chen Shizhi, Xu Afu, Li Zhihe, and Chen Qingji, and wounding Dong Macheng and twelve others. They continued to act violently. The people fled into the Chinese territory. We think that the hundreds of thousands of compatriots in Guangzhouwan were originally citizens of the Republic of China. Our government cannot ignore their suffering. Now, we respectfully represent the hundreds of thousands of people in Guangzhouwan to plead for their lives and attach photos of the dead. We earnestly request Your Excellency to show sympathy and negotiate with the French side to severely punish the responsible officers and soldiers who shot and killed the unarmed petitioners, compensate for all the losses of the victims, and abolish the mandatory labor order and all increased miscellaneous taxes that are the source of this incident, so that Guangzhouwan can still be prosperous and peaceful, in line with Viviani's declaration and the French government's policy. We will always cherish our friendship and hope to receive a reply." (May 19)</p>
<h3>Western Fujian: Remnant Bandits Attempt to Flee into Guangdong Province; Fujian and Zhejiang Troops Begin Joint Suppression of Scattered Bandits; Bandit Gangs in Northern Fujian Also Being Eliminated One by One</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The bandit leader Tan Zhenlin in Western Fujian has recently joined forces with Zhang Dingcheng, Qiu Zhiwen, Deng Zihui, and other gangs of the Communists in Longyan and Yongding counties to invade the Jinfeng and Shangyang areas of Yongding County, and their forces are quite rampant. In recent days, the armies of Fujian and Guangdong provinces have advanced to appropriate locations and launched a general offensive against the bandits. After several rounds of fierce suppression by the armies, the bandits have suffered heavy losses of their elite forces. They have now abandoned their old nest in Jinfeng and are fleeing to the border between Pu and Yong counties, attempting to invade Guangdong Province. The various bandit suppression armies, knowing the bandits' intentions, have dispatched heavy troops to key locations to block them and prevent the scattered bandits from fleeing. The 52nd Division of Lu Xingrong's troops has also used a part of its elite troops to detour to the right side of Pinghe to cut off the bandits' retreat. At the same time, Huang Renhuan's division of the Guangdong army has also sent troops from Raoping to attack the bandits. The battle situation at the front in recent days has been quite fierce. The bandits lack supplies, and internal divisions have emerged.</p>
<p>The bandit suppression operations on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang provinces are now focused on Pingyang in Zhejiang Province, because the remaining bandits in Eastern Fujian mostly flee to Pingyang by water, hoping to survive. It is reported that a part of the 50th Regiment of the 9th Division has gone to Pingyang County to pursue and suppress them, and is coordinating with a certain division in Zhejiang Province. The bandit leader Liu Ying is currently short of food and ammunition and will not be able to stand firm. He is attempting to join forces with the remnants of the bandit Huang Ligui in Jian'ou. However, the bandits' communication stations along the way have been destroyed by the army in several places. Yesterday, Zhang Fakui, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Border Areas of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, ordered all troops to begin a general suppression on the 19th to completely wipe out the remaining bandits on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang in the Taishun and Shouning border areas. As for the bandit gang of Fan Yisheng, who has been harassing the Shouning area of this province, it has been surrounded and resolved by the Fujian and Zhejiang armies. The remaining members have surrendered and turned in their weapons. Fan himself has escaped during the chaos and is currently being hunted down. The southwestern area of Yongtai in Northern Fujian, which borders Dehua, Xianyou, and Youxi counties, has been invaded by the bandit gang of Zhang Kewu of Dehua. Lin Chenghu, Hua Liguo, Lin Chengdong, Yan Dongze, Yang Weiding, Lin Chaolong, Lin Bihe, Wu Xunzhou, and others in the southwestern area have gathered hundreds of bandits and taken the opportunity to act rashly, colluding with the Zhang gang. The provincial government has sent Huang Su, the commander of the 2nd Security Regiment, to lead his troops to suppress them, and has placed two battalions of the 9th Division and one battalion of the 5th Security Regiment under his command. After receiving the order, Commander Huang deployed the troops to important locations in Dehua, Xianyou, Youxi, and Minqing counties and immediately ordered a general suppression. Within a week, except for the Li Qi gang, which escaped to the border between De and Yong counties with about 30 people, the remaining bandits were eliminated one by one. A total of one automatic rifle, more than twenty pistols, and about three hundred rifles were seized, and many were captured and killed. After Commander Huang reported to the provincial government, the provincial government sent a telegram yesterday to commend him and awarded the regiment commander a bonus of 200 yuan and the officers and soldiers who contributed a bonus of 500 yuan to encourage them. At the same time, the Fourth Pacification Zone Headquarters also learned from Commander Huang that Wu Xunzhou, the bandit leader in the northern area of Yongtai, and Yan Dongze, the bandit leader in the western area, and more than 20 others had been arrested by the plainclothes team of Battalion Commander Yang of the 2nd Security Regiment and beheaded and displayed to the public. From now on, the Tai area can be peaceful. (May 20)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Rural Hubei by Our Special Correspondent Cheng Jun</h3>
<p>(12) The Recent Situation and Special Bandit Conditions in Sui County</p>
<p>The banditry disaster in Sui County has a long history and complex situation, which is the main factor leading to the bankruptcy of the rural areas. The area is vast, the people are strong, and it is connected to Henan Province to the north, with deep mountains and dense forests, making it easy for evil people to hide. Since the roaming bandits led by Bai Lang during the second year of the Republic of China and the subsequent organization of Hu Chuntai's self-governing army, the entire territory has become a bandit's den, and its poison still exists today. The types of bandits can be roughly divided into four:</p>
<p>1.  Henan Bandits: The largest gangs are led by Wang Tai, Ma Xiyou, Cui Erdan, Wang Wu, Gu Dasheng, Xiao Liushao, Ma Guojun, etc., with thousands of people in the largest groups and hundreds in the smallest. They come and harass the area several times a year. The towns in northern Sui suffer the most. In recent years, large gangs such as Wang and Ma have roamed to other counties, and Li Hediai has risen to take their place. They always come to visit every spring and autumn harvest, never failing. Southern Henan has always been an area with many bandits, and it is only separated from Sui by the Tongbai Mountains. The bandits come here, regarding it as "doing business." Once a bandit leader calls, the bandits flock to him like ants. Not only are habitual bandits like this, but also the bad members of the local militia and the bad elements of the people are happy to share a piece of the pie. Because their movements are erratic, it is impossible to defend against them, so they can only be allowed to trample on the area. In June of last year, hundreds of bandits led by Li roamed to the Xiaolin Store and 40 Li Chong areas, broke into villages, robbed guns, killed people, and set fires. They occupied the area until this year, when they roamed to Sanligang in southern Sui. They were suppressed by the 9th Security Regiment and chased to Zhoujiaji in Yingshan, where many were killed and captured before they fled back to Henan.</p>
<p>2.  Red Bandits: In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China, He Long led more than 3,000 people to enter the area from Zhongxiang and Jingshan, roaming the Gusheng, Shuanghe, and Maozifan areas. Before long, Kuang Jixun's gang of more than 20,000 people crossed the Pinghan Railway from eastern Hubei and entered Luoyangdian, Huantan, Junchuan, Baojiaji, and Baojiaxiangzi, attempting to make the entire county red. Wei Lihuang came to the county to supervise the suppression, and they began to flee west. Then, Liu Jinbiao's gang of more than 500 people, calling themselves the Xiangbei Independent Regiment, occupied southern Sui for a year before leaving. In the 24th year, Gao Junting's gang entered the area again, causing great damage.</p>
<p>3.  Local Bandits: Also known as local bandits or roaming bandits. "Gang" means "group," which is a special term in northern Hubei. The bandit leader is called "Gangtou." The big gang leaders include Zuo Hongxue, Liu Heipi, Liu Xinghan, Liu Xinghui, Liu Zainan, Kang XX, Wu Guanzhi, Xu Dingbang, Shi Xianglong, Gao San, Wang Zhaigong, Chen Erwu, Wei XX, He Dongshan, Zhang Hanqing, Pi Laosi, Jiang XX Chun, Zhou Dingyi, etc., with as many as ten thousand people in the largest groups and as few as dozens in the smallest. They disappear and reappear, sometimes together and sometimes separated, harming southern Sui for a long time. They transform from small groups to large groups, attempting to launch a large-scale attack. Liu Zainan once served as a brigade commander in Fan Zhongxiu's Jian Guo Army and had a higher reputation. The crowd pushed him to be the chief bandit leader. When he attacked Shimenlou south of Anju, he was bravely defeated by He Battalion, led by Guan Tuan of Zhang Gang's 82nd Division. Liu was killed and his head was hung in the county seat, which can be said to have eliminated a major harm. Since that battle, the remnant bandits have scattered and fled. He Dongshan's gang fled to Weishan Luoyangdian and was defeated again by the 1st Battalion of the 9th Regiment of the local security force. The banditry momentum has been slightly curbed since then. There are also the so-called "Kang Gang" and "Short Stick Gangs." "Kang Gang" operates secretly, without raising flags, or they farm during the day and rob at night, or they lend guns to others and share the spoils while sitting on the ground. They appear to be good people after the robbery. This kind of invisible bandit is even more difficult to arrest. The bandit leaders are not forced by hunger and cold, but are infected by customs and want to get rich by taking advantage of the opportunity. Those who are starving and freezing and are beggars are the truly good people. One thing I heard is enough to prove it. A few days ago, a well-to-do family in a village was robbed by bandits, and one bandit was killed on the spot. The next day, the head of another well-to-do family suddenly disappeared. When his home was investigated, it was found that a funeral was being secretly held, and it was learned that he was the bandit who was killed. And the family that was robbed was not as rich as them. As for the so-called "Short Stick Gang," they rob travelers on the road. There are only three or five of them. They hide guns on their bodies and dress up as poor people who are picking up manure. When they encounter a small number of people walking, they shout and order them to stop, and threaten them with guns, forcing them to hand over everything they have. However, their purpose is only money, and they never kill. They take nothing of clothing or miscellaneous items, and those who have no money are also released.</p>
<p>4.  Spirit Bandits: The so-called spirit bandits are a term coined by the reporter. The county has organizations that engage in spirit possession, ostensibly to invite spirits to cure diseases, but actually to incite the people and plot wrongdoing. The leaders are Xie Yuchun and Zhang Xiufeng. Xie is from Zhaoyang, and Zhang is the principal of a school. They have more than 4,000 guns and countless followers. They were most prosperous from the 23rd to the 24th year of the Republic of China. Shuanghe, Maozifan, Tangxian Town, and Tangwangdian were all within their sphere of influence. They used the "Heavenly Fortune" calendar and the name of "Supporting the Qing and Resisting XX," and secretly had XX people disguised and participate, and created rumors that "The True Lord of Jiaxu will appear, and the Republic of Yi Hai will perish" to incite people everywhere. They also privately made dragon flags and arbitrarily bestowed king titles, and planned to attack the county seat on a fixed date. Suddenly, they were discovered by the 82nd Division, and Xie was executed, and they were disbanded. But their followers are still operating secretly. In addition, there is the Hanliu Society in Anju and Xihe, that is, the Red Gang, with about 500 people. There are also the Li Men in Junchuan, divided into "Buddhist Li" and "Family Li" gangs. Although they have no rebellious behavior, they are also not legitimate organizations. There is also the so-called Moral Society, which has been disbanded. The above-mentioned varieties can be described as treacherous and varied, extremely diverse, and their methods of dealing with the people are also different. The spirit bandits have failed, and the red bandits have become a thing of the past, so let's put them aside for now. The existing Henan bandits and local bandits are all extremely cruel. The people are killed with knives, stoned to death, nailed to death, torn apart by trees, smashed to death by rocks, and countless others are shot to death. The act of shooting is called "drilling." The wind of kidnapping is very prevalent, called "shouting tickets." Men are called "men tickets" and women are called "flower tickets." Payment is required within a time limit, and if they refuse, their ancestral graves are dug up to blackmail them, which is called "dry tickets." Sending letters to extort money is called "yelling for money." They dare to agree on a location and date and openly receive the money. The bandits occupy the villages of the people, called "setting up factories." When they march, it is called "starting a strip," because they have to form a line when they march. When they start a strip, they use burning houses as a gathering signal, and many people's houses are destroyed. In this environment where bandits are as numerous as cattle hair, a chaotic situation has been created in the whole county. Before the 82nd Division was stationed, only a security team was stationed. Outside Shicheng, gunshots could be heard from time to time. Three or five people would not dare to walk a few miles out of the city without carrying weapons. The vicinity of the city is like this, so one can imagine how remote the distant areas are. If the daytime is like this, one can imagine what the late night is like. After reading this chronicle, the reader can imagine what the world is like in Sui County, an important town in northern Hubei.</p>
<p>Now the people in northern Sui are gradually trying to defend against the Henan bandits. There are thousands of watchtowers and village stockades, and they can watch out for each other and resist the bandits. In the future, there may be a day when they will not be allowed to enter. However, the reasons for the bandits' existence can be summarized as several points: 1. Vagrant unemployment, the prevalence of smoking and gambling, and too many civilian guns. Many of the former members of the local militia and soldiers have been discharged. They were originally vagrants. Once discharged, they have nothing to do and become bandits. Smoking and gambling are prevalent in the villages and are also factors in creating bandits. Civilian guns are either left behind by defeated soldiers and Henan bandits, or bought by the people themselves (originally used to defend against bandits), or manufactured by the bandits themselves. The gun makers are unemployed workers from the Gongxian Arsenal who have returned to their hometowns and have no way to make a living, so they are used by the bandits. 2. The organization of the local security force is not strict. Local tyrants collude with the bandits to protect their families, and evil gentry protect the bandits in order to share the spoils. The local bandits are natives. The weak fear being slaughtered by them, and the strong hope to get a share of the pie, so they turn a blind eye to their robberies and do not report them to the authorities. They even provide shelter for them. If they are arrested, they try to bail them out in various ways. Some even rent out the watchtowers and village stockades to the bandits to resist the government army. 3. The government abandons its responsibility and seeks only to maintain the status quo. Government orders cannot be carried out outside the city. The bandits are not deterred or punished, and those who are not bandits have no way to be protected. Therefore, the bandits are even more unscrupulous, and those who are not bandits are also inspired to rise up. Everyone has the heart to get rich, and the sparks are igniting a prairie fire, to the point where it is impossible to control.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter can slightly supplement the situation of the local security force. Although the local security force has been organized, it is just a child's play. The joint security director and the head of the local security force are often not the right people. The power of the gentry is originally high in this area. Although there are many upright gentry, there are actually more evil gentry, so the local security force cannot escape their control. This kind of gentry class has the so-called "Eight Great Kings," "Ten Great Warriors," "Ten Kings of Hell," and "Seventy-Two Little Devils." The former ten district chiefs and seventy-two joint security directors are the mixed names of the Kings of Hell and the Little Devils. The inferiority of the head of the local security force can be inferred. It is said that when the 82nd Division went to the villages to suppress bandits, they inquired about the household registration, but there was no household registration book or house number. They called a meeting, but the head of the local security force did not come, and some joint security directors did not know the head of the local security force. Even the preparatory work has not been done, let alone the substance. Although there are house numbers near the city, they are just a tool for extortion. The reporter personally saw several peasant women carrying house numbers outside the North Gate and asked if this paper required money. They replied, "It is issued once in April, and 160 wen are charged. This time it is changed, and 60 wen are charged." Upon reading the house number, it clearly stated "No money is charged." It must be the head of the local security force who is causing trouble again.</p>
<p>In terms of the current situation of Sui, the most important tasks are thorough cleaning of the villages and reorganization of the local security force. When the former Commissioner Yang Enxi was in office, the 82nd Division happened to be transferred to the county, and he convened an emergency meeting of the party, government, and military to decide to launch a large-scale cleaning of the villages, assigning the Standing Committee of the Special Party Department of the division, Shen Liang, and the Director of the Political Training Department, Zhang Chuqing, to be responsible for the highest guidance. Because Yang was transferred, it was not carried out. However, the army has begun to go to the villages to search and suppress bandits, which is commendable. The new Commissioner Shi Yuling was transferred here from Tianmen and is still in Zhongxiang supervising the construction of dikes and has not yet visited Sui. His plan to govern Sui is said to focus on reorganizing the local security force and registering civilian guns, which will be started soon. These are all the things that the people of Sui, after the robbery, are eagerly hoping for. It is hoped that the political and military authorities will work together to promote their realization.

<h3>Suzhou: Abundant Coal Reserves in Xishan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>The Xishan Chengquan Coal Mine in Dongting Xishan, Suzhou, has been started with 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Now, the mine's organizers, Lu Gantang and others, lack funds and plan to lease it to others to continue mining. Those who have contacted them include Du and Zhang, well-known figures in Shanghai, and overseas Chinese Wang, etc. There have been some discussions, and it will be decided that Wang will take over. In the future, four dimes of silver will be paid to Lu for each ton of coal mined as a mine royalty. The contract will be signed in a few days. The overseas Chinese Wang is investing 1.4 million yuan to engage in mechanical mining. According to engineers, the coal reserves in the mountain are abundant, with a capacity of more than 20 million tons, and the quality of the coal is excellent, better than Zhongxing coal. Seven coal mines can be opened (five earthen mines have already been opened. When mechanical mining is used in the future, it can accommodate more than 1,000 workers). It is said that the coal from the mine can be used for trains. Wang is currently in contact with the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau to purchase the coal, which may become a reality.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Frequent Bandit Alarms</h3>
<p>Frequent bandit alarms have been heard in the villages of Likou and Huangdai in Suzhou. Suspected bandits, Li Jin and others, have been arrested one after another, and the details have been published in the newspaper. It is now known that at about 9 p.m. on the 20th, the Huangdai Township Office suddenly received a report from a villager in Jinshan, saying that more than ten bandit ships carrying dozens of bandits had arrived in Jinshan, five or six miles away from the town, at about 8 p.m., intending to rob the villages. They requested that a team be sent to pursue and arrest them. The Township Office immediately notified the Public Security Bureau and the Security Detachment to send a team to rush to pursue and suppress them overnight, but there was no movement. They immediately went to various places to search, and did not return to the town until dawn on the 21st, without any gains. Later, it was found that what they had found were actually large numbers of fishing boats, not bandit ships, and they realized it was a misunderstanding. However, this also shows that the villagers are so afraid of bandits that they see bandits everywhere. Also, near Yangcheng Lake in Xiangcheng Township, three bandit ships were found on the morning of the 21st. After the bandits were found, the entire police force was mobilized on the 20th to be on special alert. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau personally led ten patrol boats to search for bandits in the Caohe area. They returned to the city on the 21st. In the countryside in Likou and Lu XX, intermittent and incessant gunshots were heard one after another on the night of the 20th. The truth is unclear, and the Public Security Bureau is investigating. The Public Security Bureau has also sent police teams to Huangtiandang and other places to be on alert to prevent any eventuality. As for the city's defense, it is also very strict. Police are sent to check suspicious pedestrians at various key points in the evening to prevent bandits from mixing into the urban area. The Detective Team also arrested Tang He, a wanted criminal in the Chen XX Xiang XX Shen Ru kidnapping and tearing ticket case, at the Cheng Detang broker shop at No. 50 Yuyuxiang in the city, and has handed him over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Details of the Zhou Yu Adultery and Murder Case</h3>
<p>Jia Huogui (also known as Hongxian), a farmer in Quzhuangjiao, Zhou XX Wan XX Xiang, 8th District of Kunshan County, married Wu. A tragedy occurred on the evening of the 11th of this month. Both husband and wife died. It is now known that this case was an adultery and murder. Jia Huogui's wife was slightly attractive and had been having an affair with someone in a neighboring village for several years. Jia also knew about it. On the evening of that day, the paramour came to Jia's house again to meet with Wu, but was discovered by Jia's elder brother, Yin XX, who informed his younger brother. Jia Huogui could not suppress his jealousy and took a sickle and entered the room and hacked Wu to death. The adulterer, seeing his mistress being killed, also drew a knife and struck Jia hard in the back of the head, and Jia also fell to the ground and died. Then, he dragged his body out and threw it into the river in front of the door. Jia had a daughter, only eight years old, who was greatly frightened by the sight and rushed out to call for help. Neighbors also heard the alarm and came, and saw Wu dying on the bed, the scene was very tragic. Then, Jia's body was fished out. The next morning, the head of the local security force reported to the police management area, which then reported to the county government to send personnel to inspect the bodies. Unexpectedly, the murderer used money to bribe the gods and begged the local thugs to dredge through Jia's mother, Xu, and Jia's elder brother, Yinshou, to the Zhou XX sub-office of the 8th District Office to request a written guarantee to the county government to avoid the inspection, falsely claiming that the couple had quarreled and Qian Gui had accidentally beaten Wu to death and committed suicide by drowning in the river out of fear of punishment. As a result, they were deceived at the time, and the two bodies were placed in coffins. Afterwards, the rumors spread and the discussions were varied. According to the report of the police officers, the Public Security Bureau confirmed that it was a case of adultery and murder. Because it was a matter of human life, they reported it to County Magistrate Peng. On the morning of the 19th, the Public Security Bureau's Section Chief and others went to the villages with the county bailiffs for secret investigation, and the truth became clear. On the morning of the 20th, the two coffins were transported to the Qingzhen Temple in the city and opened for inspection. As a result, both were found to have been hacked to death before their deaths. The main culprit is now being severely apprehended for legal action.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: The Unified Tax Administration Office to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Unified Tax Administration Office was established in the 19th year of the Republic of China, with jurisdiction over six counties: Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, Jiangyin, and Jiading.

However, the truck driver did not look back and drove away. At that time, passersby who saw the car hit the pedestrian noted that its license plate number was "Su Zi No. 2062" and reported it to the First Public Security Sub-station for investigation. Inspector Tang Zhenzhong immediately sent personnel to investigate. The deceased villager appeared to be a tailor. The case was immediately reported to the local court prosecutor for further investigation.

<h3>Haizhou: "Kala-azar" Disease Spreads in the Haizhou Area</h3>
<p>In recent years, kala-azar has spread widely in various counties in the Haizhou area. Most of the patients are young children in rural villages. When the disease first appears, the patient becomes pale and emaciated, loses appetite, and develops a hard mass in the abdomen, which gradually enlarges. If treatment is delayed, the patient will die. According to Director Zhu of the Longhai Hospital outside the North Gate of this county, the hospital treats approximately one thousand kala-azar patients each year, indicating the rapid spread of the disease.</p>

<h3>Huzhou: Fire Destroys Three Shops on Zhicheng Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 2 AM on the 20th of this month, a fire broke out suddenly at the Deda general store on Zhicheng Road in the city. Flames spread rapidly and could not be extinguished.

<h3>Japanese Fishing Vessels Invade Fishing Grounds</h3>
<p>The waters off Sheshan, Zhejiang, are a spawning ground for small yellow croaker, and the yield is extremely rich, and can be called the lifeline of the Zhejiang fishermen. Recently, Japanese fishing vessels have frequently invaded the area for fishing, causing significant losses to the fishermen. Recently, this has become even more serious. Four large buoys with iron chains, bearing the Japanese characters "Nippon Maru," were discovered in the northeast of the Sheshan waters. It is speculated that the intention is to use the buoys as a boundary to prevent our fishermen from fishing. When local gentry learned of this, they considered that the Japanese fishing vessels were arbitrarily demarcating fishing grounds, which affected Chinese fishing, and specially requested the county magistrate to report to the provincial government and lodge a protest with the Japanese consul.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Wenling County Civic Training Class</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shenbao:</p>
<p>I have read the news item on May 12th entitled "Wenling Zongwen Middle School Students Destroy County Party Headquarters" in your newspaper, which does not entirely match the facts. Here is a detailed account of what happened:</p>
<p>Yin Gongbo, a member of the second term of the civic training class organized by our association (a teacher at Zongwen School and head of the scout troop, from Pinghu), disobeyed military discipline. After repeated gentle persuasion, he remained unrepentant. On the 5th, the civic training class decided to expel Yin Gongbo from the school, which was originally a lenient punishment. After learning of this notice, Cai Songfen, the principal of the school, and Xu Guangqiu, the director of instruction, immediately convened an emergency meeting of teachers and staff, as well as a student meeting. The students went on strike, and all the teachers and staff resigned. They also sent a telegram to the Provincial Party Department, the Education Department, and the Commissioner's Office. At around 3 PM, more than 100 students gathered at the Party Headquarters. They first sent four representatives to look for Chen Jifu, Lin Ziqing, Lin Yuncong, and Ye Cheng. Chen Jifu and Lin Ziqing received them, but before they could reason with them, a whistle sounded, and they surged forward. The four doors were tightly closed, the telephone was cut off, and the office windows and walls were smashed. Chen Jifu, a member of the executive committee and the first district captain of the civic training class, and Lin Ziqing, a company commander, were beaten and injured. Meanwhile, all the teachers and staff sat in the county government to avoid the situation and did not stop or obstruct the students. Only after the incident did Principal Cai and Director Xu come to the headquarters to call them back. They obeyed and went back in formation. This is the factual account of what happened.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to request that you publish this information to make corrections. I am eagerly awaiting your response. With best regards,</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Zhejiang Province, Wenling County, May 16th</p>

<p>Leader's Speech: Wang Quansheng said during the voyage, "This time, we returned to the country and visited major factories and military and political organs in places such as Jing, Hu, Hang, Su, and Xi. The progress of industry and commerce in China in recent years is very rapid. Factories have established their own schools, hospitals, and female workers all live in the factory, which is very convenient for work. The management is also very perfect. It is believed that the Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory and Huaxin Silk Factory have the newest machines, and they pay attention to the use of national goods, which can be a model for all factories. The Chinese people deeply believe in the government, and all people unite and cooperate. Under the guidance of the Party and the country, they work hard. The people must obey the command of the authorities, so that their spirits can be united, and everything can be done with one heart and one mind, and the effect will be great. Now the government is a government that does things, and strives for practical development. I and all the members of the delegation have decided to go to Xiamen and return to our hometowns for a trip. We plan to take a boat to Hong Kong on the 28th. If time permits, we will go to Guangzhou to pay tribute to Chairman Hu and meet with friends in the Southwest. After returning to the Philippines, we will report to the overseas Chinese about the rapid progress of national goods and try to promote them as much as possible so that everyone can love and use national goods." It is heard that Wang plans to return to the country again during the second plenary session of this term to attend.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Commercial Delegation Held a Manufacturers' Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Depart by Boat on July 3rd; Distributed Letters to Manufacturers Soliciting National Product Exhibits</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the Nanyang Commercial Delegation organized by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association has more than 60 participants. It is scheduled to depart on the "Zhesaidanni" on July 3rd to investigate eight major ports: Manila, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, Penang, Saigon, Siam, and Medan. The association also convened a manufacturers' conference yesterday afternoon. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Meeting: Jin Songtang of the China Enamel Factory, Dai Zhicheng of the Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Xu Xiaochu of the Sino-French Pharmacy, Zhang Yongfan of the Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Wang Gongquan of the Tianxiang Seasoning Factory, Deng Qiyao of the Chengchang Export Company, Hu Juewen of the Cooperative Hardware Company, Wu Chunquan of the Forest Factory, Xu Zhaolin of the Yukang Socks Factory, Du Bingshou of the Family Industry Society, Ye Youcai of the Huasheng Electrical Factory, Hu Shicheng of the Huachang Steel Factory, Guo, Yongkang of the China Chemical Industry Society, etc. were present. Zhang Huikang chaired and reported briefly. The discussion was on how to handle the catalog of products produced by the members' factories. It was resolved that the association should print 2,000 copies for the purpose of external publicity for all members, with the content listed in both Chinese and English. The resolution to notify each factory to send a Chinese and English price list to the association was passed. A proposal to print 10,000 sample identification cards for the delegation was resolved to be priced by the general manager and then reviewed. The method of participating in the agency factory was resolved that each factory should subsidize the agency fee of 100 yuan. In addition to the methods already stipulated in the regulations, it is also planned to revise and print a notice to the members of the Production and Sales Cooperative Association and the Machine Federation to solicit participation. The proposal of Mr. Cai Enzhi, a special representative of the Philippine Chinese Commercial Daily, to come to Shanghai to discuss publicity methods was resolved that the newspaper should be commended for its special welcome issue. However, the delegation's external publicity will be handled by the delegation as a whole, and the advertisements of each factory will be discussed when they arrive in the Philippines. It was resolved that the delegates' clothing should be all-national white canvas suits, and was passed. Others were omitted.</p>
<p>Soliciting Exhibits: The association also sent a letter to the Joint Association of Machine-made National Goods Factories and the Production and Sales Cooperative Association: The Nanyang Commercial Delegation organized by our association has been organized and has more than 30 participating members. We are now being urged by overseas Chinese to hope that Chinese national goods can take advantage of our delegation to promote to the overseas Chinese as much as possible, and we hope that national goods exhibition halls can be established in various places to establish a permanent establishment and win glory for the international community. My colleagues at the Association feel that it is our duty to welcome the participation of various factories. This trip is due to time and personnel issues, and many factories have not been able to send as many personnel as possible, which is regrettable. Now, for the sake of encouragement and publicity, our association has specific methods for entrusting participation in exhibits, and welcomes non-members who want to join, without having to send personnel to handle it by representatives of our delegation, so that Chinese national products can be promoted to South China as much as possible and save rights and interests for the country. The progress of national goods is a matter of concern. We hope that your association will notify all members to solicit participation, and we are very fortunate.</p>

<h3>Yaza Saidi Sends a Letter of Thanks for the Hospitality of Our Country, Saying that the Prosperity of the Philippines is a Blessing of Our Country and Hopes that Our Country Will Pay Attention to Trade with the Philippines</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Manrea Yaza Saidi, a Philippine Congressman and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, led a delegation of Philippine Congressmen to China for a sightseeing tour and was well received by the government and people of our country.

Your country is like our sister. I can say without embellishment that I cannot be more grateful for the progress of culture and commerce in our country. Your country's merchants came to our country five or six centuries ago, but now it is unfortunate that your country's trade with the Philippines has been very weak and has been gradually declining. There is no other reason why your country is not paying attention to trade with the Philippines when it comes to foreign trade sales.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association yesterday sent separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Industry, stating: "Our country is an agricultural nation, and the silkworm and mulberry industries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the most prosperous in the world, and have been rich areas since ancient times. As a result, silk fabrics sell well throughout the country and overseas. Not only is all commerce prosperous, but the rural economy is also very abundant. The products are valuable and durable; a suit of clothing can be passed down for generations, benefiting people's livelihoods, and is not insignificant. Therefore, the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu, such as Ning, Zhen, Sudan, Sheng, and Shanghai, and Zhejiang, such as Hang, Jia, Hu, Ning, and Shao, are thriving, and industry and commerce are flourishing, all of which depend on this. However, in recent times,</p>
<p>National Silk Exports</p>
<p>have been rejected by various countries due to heavy taxes, and the only remaining domestic sales channels have been flooded with foreign goods and rayon fabrics, with economic invasion becoming more intense in recent years. Today, it is pervasive and has become dominant. Moreover, the sales of national goods have been cut off in North China, leaving commerce with no way to go, leading to increasingly difficult social finance, collapsing industry and commerce, bankrupting the countryside, and ultimately impoverishing the people and exhausting the country, with national difficulties deepening day by day. The reasons for this, although not limited to one, are mainly due to the displacement of silk products by rayon. Since Chinese silk fabrics have been invaded and sold by rayon, they have been in dire straits, and the main product of sericulture, on which the countryside depends for its livelihood, has also been nearly eliminated and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Farmers, merchants, and businessmen are all harmed. With the people's wealth depleted, how can the country not become increasingly poor and weak? These things that endanger the country are more terrible than floods and fierce beasts. This association recognized the harm early on and sent representatives to Beijing in the first year of the Republic to petition for the promulgation of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Clothing Regulations.</p>
<p>The Senate then resolved to approve the regulations on October 3 of that year, with an order from the President of the Republic to promulgate the regulations, stipulating that the materials for men's and women's ceremonial clothing should be made of domestic silk, cotton, linen, and wool fabrics, and that various styles, colors, and sizes should also be clearly specified. It was hoped that this would maintain the silk fabrics that were about to be abandoned and save the failing rural sericulture. It was unexpected that those who spoke earnestly were met with indifference, treating the regulations as mere formalities and disregarding them. They went their own way, competing for fashion, and wearing so-called modern clothing, regardless of whether it was domestic or not, but only seeking to be novel and vying to show off new clothes. The fashion changed all the time, so foreign rayon fabrics took the opportunity to enter and compete with our silk fabrics and cloth in the market. Our compatriots, with a weak sense of patriotism, did not hesitate to spend good money to buy these things that endanger the country, and rejected domestic silk and cotton fabrics. No wonder foreigners</p>
<p>Evade Taxes and Smuggle</p>
<p>large quantities of rayon fabrics to sell throughout the country in order to cater to the psychology of the Chinese people. What is more regrettable, hateful, and pitiful than this? Moreover, our country is an agricultural country, and agricultural products such as silk and cotton are extremely abundant, providing more than enough to meet the needs of the whole country. If we emulate the national protection of commerce in various countries and Shanxi's policy of self-sufficiency, we should not allow rayon and rayon to be imported for competition, which has led to today's serious results. By the time the big mistake was made, it was too late to turn back. Chinese silk merchants had to drink poison to quench their thirst and mix rayon to improve their products to meet market demand. How could they know that the more they improved, the more people's livelihoods would be cut off? Silk fabrics were already defeated, and rayon fabrics were also becoming increasingly innovative and changing rapidly. Today's popular style would be outdated tomorrow, causing silk factories to be dazzled and at a loss. Business declined and reached</p>
<p>A Precarious Situation.</p>
<p>Those who have already been sacrificed, such as Jiuxing, Cheng Yuan, and Hulin factories, and countless others that have closed down, with unemployed industrial and commercial workers calling for help but finding no door, sitting and waiting for death. The remaining silk industry is barely surviving. In addition, the collateral damage is heavier in the pawn and clothing industries. Because the clothing made of rayon fabrics has no value, cannot be secured or preserved, and the clothing sizes are chaotic and the styles are bizarre, the pawn industry has suddenly become unable to operate. The cotton weaving, leather goods, embroidery, and shoe industries are also declining and unable to recover. Alas, it is strange that people turn a blind eye to such an important issue that affects their vital interests and do not think of a fundamental solution. It is said that silk weaving manufacturers still regard rayon as a necessary commodity at present, so there is a saying that they cannot give it up for the time being. However, they do not know that rayon is</p>
<p>Endangering the Foundation of the Country</p>
<p>so seriously. At the moment, in North China, cotton textiles, seafood, and other goods are being smuggled in large quantities to various markets and sold as much as possible. If we do not devise a fundamental solution to restore the situation, the disaster of national subjugation is imminent. This association has considered it again and again, weighing the importance of the situation. In order to implement the late Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood, relieve rural bankruptcy, and maintain the national industry, we should urgently request the government to order the provincial, municipal, and county governments and party departments to supervise the enforcement of woolen clothing, and especially to strictly ban bizarre and foreign clothing for women, such as those that expose the chest and arms. Or, the construction departments of various provinces should set up national clothing bureaus, ordering the counties and towns to imitate the Baojia system and encourage and supervise the implementation of the policy from house to house. The clothing of a country is of great importance to the country and society, and the fundamental principle should be to use clothing made of domestic materials. Looking at the people of various countries in the East and West, they all wear their own domestic products to strengthen the national foundation. There is no such strange phenomenon as in our country, where we abandon</p>
<p>Domestic Fabrics</p>
<p>and instead buy and wear imported wool and rayon fabrics. Things rot and insects are born, and there is a reason for this. As for the quantity of rayon and its fabrics imported, we should request the government to restrict them year by year and gradually ban them in stages, in order to cultivate the national foundation and save the people's livelihood. Furthermore, this association has been promoting national goods for more than twenty years, but because it is only empty talk, the effect is extremely difficult, and the strength is weak and cannot remedy the time limit. Therefore, we earnestly request the government to quickly correct the case of promoting national goods, supervise the implementation, and imitate the Baojia system, with each neighborhood chief encouraging each household, and punishing those who violate the regulations. The key to saving the country lies in this one move. If it is implemented for three or five years, not only will most of the loopholes be plugged, but our country's transformation from weak to strong will also depend on this. The telegram is urgent, and we are extremely afraid and await orders. Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Huang Chucai, standing committee members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, respectfully kowtow, plus seal.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Ordered to Guide Trademark Registration, No Need to Set Up Shanghai Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association stating that since the Trademark Bureau moved to Beijing, it has been inconvenient to contact them, and requested that a Shanghai office or receiving office be set up. The Chamber immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry. Now, the Ministry of Industry has notified the following: "The case of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association previously requesting an order to the Trademark Bureau to set up a Shanghai office or receiving office was previously ordered to the Trademark Bureau for discussion and reply, and a note was issued for notification. Now, according to the Trademark Bureau's reply on May 4 of this year, it stated: 'The Ministry's General Letter No. 20491 and General Letter No. 20525 ordered the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to request the establishment of an office in Shanghai, and ordered an immediate joint discussion and reply, etc. Upon receiving this, the Bureau previously set up specialist offices in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other ports to promote trademark registration, hoping to provide nearby guidance for the convenience of merchants and people. However, at the beginning of the matter, each specialist's work report was reviewed in detail, and except for forwarding official documents, they all relied on empty words for actual guidance. The cases received and forwarded by the Bureau still had many errors in procedure, and merchants who requested instructions on registration matters still came directly to the Bureau, only having the name of an office but not the reality of guidance. During the forwarding, time was wasted, becoming an invisible delay. After overall planning, it was planned to change the course and aim to benefit merchants and people. Therefore, in the month of this year, the Bureau submitted to the Ministry to abolish the specialist offices in various ports, and because the existing registration guidelines lacked detailed explanations, the various trademark laws and regulations were comprehensively interpreted and explained separately, and the language was changed to vernacular, so that the public could easily understand. The current Trademark Law and its implementation rules were printed in multiple copies, and it was planned to distribute them to the chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities for nearby distribution and guidance. The application forms and agent authorization forms printed by the Bureau were also planned to be stored in the chambers of commerce in various places, asking them to widely inform local merchants to take them nearby, so as to avoid the trouble of transferring and receiving them, and to achieve the effect of popularization. Furthermore, because foreigners often requested to read the trademark laws and regulations, the Bureau selected staff members who were proficient in Western languages and knowledgeable about trademark studies to translate them into册for application. While preparing to proceed, the Bureau was ordered to move to Beijing and stop working, so it was also temporarily suspended. As soon as the relocation was completed, the Bureau continued the previous plan and planned to submit a special report to the Ministry after the publications were整理completed, so that it could be implemented. After repeatedly receiving orders to交 the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Bureau checked that although the Associations claimed that the establishment of an office in Shanghai would be convenient for merchants and people, the Bureau's management of national trademark administration could not set up offices everywhere, falling into the problem that Yao and Shun were still sick. In view of the situation of the previous offices in ports, there were only delays and few benefits in giving instructions. Moreover, all cases handled by the Bureau were written applications and written reviews. There was never a case of summoning applicants to the Bureau for questioning. The postal delivery of written orders between Beijing and Shanghai could be completed in one day. What inconvenience was there? Furthermore, a Shanghai office was established in 1928, and in 1931, the government ordered it to be designated as a redundant agency and ordered it to be abolished. From the point of view of things, it is not necessary to set it up; from the point of view of government orders, it should not be set up. Now that the Bureau has moved to Beijing, the offices in various places have been abolished uniformly. In the month or so since the office has been open, the number of applications for registration has been increasing day by day. If the planned plan is implemented, merchants in various places should feel more convenient, and there is no need to set up separate offices. As for the corner of Shanghai, where foreign merchants are 林立, at the time of the Bureau's relocation, it was planned to entrust the Bureau to provide guidance on the printed and translated trademark laws and regulations, registration instructions, application forms, and agent authorization forms, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9 of the Organizational Regulations of the International Trade Bureau. Recently, Deputy Director Zhang of the Bureau went to Beijing and discussed it in person, and agreed to handle it, so that there would be no inconvenience for foreigners. By order of the previous cause, the Bureau has prepared a document stating the reasons why there is no need to set up a Shanghai office, as well as the Bureau's planned lecture, for review and instruction to be followed. It is a matter of public convenience, etc. According to this, the above-mentioned sections are still true. The powers of the Ministry's International Trade Bureau, according to the provisions of Article 4, paragraph 9 of the Organizational Regulations, may respond to inquiries from Chinese and foreign merchants regarding the trademark registration process. Now, in order to make it easier for Chinese and foreign merchants to understand this procedure, the Ministry has formulated the International Trade Bureau's Guidance on Trademark Registration Procedures and ordered the International Trade Bureau to set up a Trademark Registration Procedure Information Office to provide convenience. In addition to instructing the Trademark Bureau to inform them and separately notifying them, they should issue a copy of the International Trade Bureau's Guidance on Trademark Registration Procedures. You should know and follow this, especially this notification. Attached is the International Trade Bureau's Guidance on Trademark Registration Procedures. The International Trade Bureau should designate a specialist to prepare for inquiries from Chinese and foreign merchants regarding trademark registration. The above-mentioned inquiries are limited to explaining and interpreting the trademark registration procedure, and do not involve the content of the application, nor do they collect application documents. The trademark laws and regulations application forms and publications for guiding registration will be sent by the Trademark Bureau to the International Trade Bureau, and should be given to Chinese and foreign merchants when they ask for them. The specialists designated by the International Trade Bureau should provide detailed guidance to merchants when they inquire.</p>

<h3>Police Officers at All Stations Should Advise Passengers to Disembark First and Then Board, Railway Department Orders Two Railway Bureaus to Comply</h3>
<p>The two railway administrations received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that the New Life Movement Promotion Association sent an official letter No. 3213 on May 7 of this year, reporting that the Zhejiang Provincial New Life Movement Association had requested the Ministry to forward a letter stating that each train should have designated boarding and alighting doors to prevent passengers from crowding and competing. The letter was forwarded for reference. It was approved. It was found that the designation of boarding and alighting doors for passenger vehicles has been adopted by various railways in the past, but passengers tend to prefer to be close to the doors, so although there are regulations, they are rarely effective. To maintain order on the platform, the principle of "disembark first and then board" should still be strictly enforced. In addition to replying to the letter, the bureau should instruct the police officers at each station to advise passengers to disembark first and then board, and to earnestly maintain order on the platform and in the train cars to improve appearances. This order has been forwarded by the bureau to the transportation department and the police department for compliance.</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Products</h3>

<h3>The Liquidator of the American-Fong Bank Will Issue Continued Deposits on a Regular Basis, 10 Percent Available on June 10</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported yesterday that Dr. Schlaet, the liquidator of the closed American-Fong Bank, has now decided to continue issuing 10 percent of the deposits owed to depositors. The staff of the liquidation office is currently busy preparing checks to be signed by the doctor, with a date of 60 days. Once the signatures are completed, they will be mailed to each account. The late liquidator, Mr. Ho Fushi, had issued 7.5 percent of the deposits in December of last year, six months after the bank's closure. When Dr. Schlaet took over as liquidator after Mr. Ho's death, he stated that Mr. Ho had prepared to continue issuing 10 percent. Mr. Ho had also stated before leaving for the United States this spring that depositors could recover at most 25 percent of their deposits.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 Jin of Hawksbill Turtle Will Be Displayed Today</h3>
<p>The Whole Body Is Red, Fierce, and Abnormal. Two Fishermen Were Injured During Capture. It Will Be Exhibited in the New World Today.</p>
<p>Fishermen in Shipu Town, which belongs to the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province outside Wusongkou, recently captured a hawksbill turtle weighing about 400 jin in the local sea. It is shaped like a turtle, but it is not. This huge monster has been transported to Shanghai and will be displayed from today onwards for the public to view. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hawksbill Turtle The hawksbill turtle became a sensation in the surrounding areas because of its extraordinary size after being captured by Shipu fishermen.</p>
<p>Origin It was purchased by a Shanghai merchant at a high price, who then tried to transport it. It arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday.</p>
<p>Exhibition Today</p>
<p>The hawksbill turtle's body is red, about seven feet long and five feet wide. The mouth is sharp, like an eagle's beak. It weighs more than 400 jin. What is strange is that there are countless mussel shells on its back, which proves that it has lived in the sea for a long time. It is also said that when the Shipu fishermen captured it, it resisted strongly, causing injuries to two fishermen, which shows the ferocity of the animal. It has been decided that the hawksbill turtle will be displayed in the New World on Xizang Road and Nanjing Road from today onwards for the public to view.</p>

<h3>Between Two Women, Family Disputes Arise Frequently. Zhang Re-Praised His Concubine and Abused His Wife. His Wife Filed a Complaint of Bigamy at the Police Station.</h3>
<p>Zhang Ranyang, a native of Ningbo, is 31 years old. He has been engaged in the Western-style clothing business for many years and has accumulated some savings. He opened the Tianxing Western Clothing Store at No. 1880, North Sichuan Road, Public Concession, and the business is not bad, making him well-off. Zhang's wife, Ms. Deng, is 27 years old. After marrying Zhang in her hometown eight or nine years ago, she followed him to Shanghai and settled at No. 3, Hongan Lane, Laobazi Road. Their relationship was excellent, and they enjoyed a harmonious life. Unexpectedly, in the 22nd year, Zhang Ranyang's attitude suddenly changed. After Ms. Deng probed in many ways, she learned that Zhang had met a Changzhou woman named Chen Lanxiu, who lived together like a married couple. At that time, she invited relatives to negotiate with Zhang, but Zhang used the excuse that Ms. Deng had not had children for a long time and hoped to have offspring. He also said that he would definitely place Ms. Chen in the ranks of concubines. At that time, Ms. Deng was persuaded by relatives to change her mind, so she allowed Chen to enter the house and live with her. Who knew that after living together for a short time, Zhang and Chen actually regarded Ms. Deng as a thorn in their side and ignored her on weekdays. Moreover, Zhang pampered and threatened Chen, and even secretly returned to his hometown to hold a wedding ceremony, inviting guests everywhere. Therefore, when Zhang returned to Shanghai, Ms. Deng had another major negotiation with Zhang. Unexpectedly, Zhang took the opportunity to move Chen out and build a golden house in the Tianxing Western Clothing Store. In addition to giving Ms. Deng a small allowance each month, he never visited her. Ms. Deng felt that her life was difficult, so she moved to No. 32, Chongye Lane, North Sichuan Road, a small room, alone day and night. Every time she thought of the various behaviors of her husband and Chen, she felt endless resentment. However, she lacked close relatives in Shanghai and had no way to complain. Unable to bear it any longer, she filed a complaint with the Hongkou Police Station yesterday, accusing her husband Zhang Ranyang of bigamy. However, the police station stated that the case involved a private prosecution and they had no right to accept it, so they did not accept it. They instructed Ms. Deng to file a lawsuit in court, so Ms. Deng has turned to a lawyer to prepare a lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Three Boats Collided, a Boatman's Foot Was Crushed, the Boat Bosses Gave Conflicting Statements</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a Pengfei tugboat was towing a wharf boat No. 8944 out of the Suzhou River. The boat was loaded with 262 packages of jujubes. When it was towed to the mouth of the Suzhou River and was about to head south, a pottery sailboat entered the river. Unable to avoid it, the bow of the pottery boat accidentally entered the space between the tugboat and the jujube boat. Fan A'mei, a cook from Changshu on the jujube boat, was afraid of a collision, so she went to the bow to push the pottery boat away. Because she was standing unsteadily, her lower body fell from the bow into the space between the two boats, and her right foot was crushed on the spot. She was rescued by the boatmen, who reported to the water patrol police station and sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because her foot bone was broken, she will be disabled. The three boat bosses gave conflicting statements. Yesterday, the police station ordered them to be sent to the District Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Blue Automobile Company Accused of Fraud: Not a Single Car Delivered, Workers Sue for Return of Guarantee Deposits</h3>
<p>Zhou Chang, a Cantonese residing at No. 6, Xinmin Village, Huanlong Road, French Concession (42 years old, son of Zhou Shoumin, current Chairman of China Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, possessing assets of tens of millions), in 1933, with Westerner Peng Nan, Chinese Yao Qixiang, and others, jointly raised capital to establish the Blue Automobile Company at No. 20, 2nd Floor, No. 215, Tiantong Road, Public Concession. They placed an order for 200 automobiles with the Meitong Automobile Company. Recently, the company moved to No. 546, Avenue Albert, French Concession, scheduled to open on April 1st of this year. Zhou Richang served as chairman, and Yao Qixiang was appointed manager. They advertised for workers. Those who passed the qualifications, including Wang Qinghe, Shi Qiyou, Jin Xianzhen, Wang Wenxi, Zhen Ziyu, Man Qingrong, Sui Heju, Ren Zhongbao, and over ten others, each paid a guarantee deposit of 20 yuan, with a stipulated monthly wage of 16 yuan. The workers reported to the company daily from April 1st, waiting for the cars to arrive and begin work. During this period, Yao Qixiang was the manager, and Zhou Richang initially served as chairman, later also assuming the position of general manager. Yao suddenly resigned from the manager position to Zhou. However, the workers waited at the company for nearly a month without being assigned any work or seeing any cars arrive. They requested the return of their guarantee deposits from the company, but Zhou Richang repeatedly refused to pay. The workers, believing that the company had not received any cars and had no work to offer, suspected a conspiracy to defraud them. They rallied and demanded the return of their deposits. However, Zhou Richang and Yao Qixiang shirked responsibility and ignored them. Workers Wang Qinghe and others jointly appointed a lawyer to act on their behalf and filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhou Richang of fraud and requesting an investigation. The court, upon receiving the complaint, held two court sessions, both postponed due to Zhou Richang's absence. An arrest warrant was issued by the court and served. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanxing presided over the trial in the Criminal Division. Defendant Zhou Richang, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court to respond to the charges. The plaintiffs first stated the facts of the prosecution. When questioned, Zhou Richang stated, "I first served as chairman and later as manager. Previously, all company matters were handled by Yao Qixiang." Judge Qiu, verifying the statement, told Zhou, "Yao stated in another case that you were the general manager and provided 50,000 yuan. You stated that he had financial resources, which is obviously nonsensical. Moreover, the company has not received a single car to date. You hired so many workers and collected guarantee deposits from them. This behavior clearly constitutes fraudulent means." After the statement, he ordered both sides' lawyers to debate. Finally, he declared the proceedings closed and scheduled the sentencing for the 25th.</p>
<h3>United Steel Cable Factory: Two Engineers Suddenly Kidnapped: Twenty to Thirty Plainclothes Men Arrived in Cars to Abduct Them; Four Bandits Arrested in the Jue Lu Hotel</h3>
<p>Xu Fugeng and Xie Huizhou, engineers at the United Steel Cable Factory at No. 10, Xujiazhai, Huangxing Road, Yinxiang Port, were kidnapped by twenty to thirty plainclothes men in four cars belonging to the Southern Automobile Company around 6:00 AM yesterday. Afterward, the factory manager, Zhang Yulin, reported the incident to the Yinxiang Port Police Station, which dispatched detectives. At 4:00 PM, they, together with Chief Detective Zhang Yuanqing and Detective Zhang Yi of the Lao Zha station, arrested Chen Futang, owner of the Helongchang Steel Cable Factory at No. 1, Cao'an Tou, Pudong, workers Zhang Miaosheng, Xu Xiaomao, Zhang Qingsheng, and others in Room 81, 2nd Floor of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. Chen confessed to kidnapping Xu and Xie, stating that they had been handed over to the General Bureau. However, Xu and Xie have not been released.</p>
<h3>Zhang Mingfa's Old Age is Desolate: Accuses Son and Daughter-in-Law of Abandonment: Trial Opens, Plaintiff Cannot Be Summoned: Only Grandson Appears to State Everything</h3>
<p>Zhang Mingfa, from Zhenhai, over seventy years old, used to run a business in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he suffered repeated failures, and his store was declared bankrupt on January 16th of this year. All his property was squandered by his son Zhang Zhongfu, daughter-in-law Zhang Le's, and grandson Zhang Xiaoxian. They treated the old man like a stranger, and no one supported him, leaving Zhang in dire straits and unable to return home. Recently, he filed a complaint accusing his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson of malicious abandonment, requesting punishment according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xuan of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court opened the trial. Plaintiff Zhang Mingfa could not be found to be served a warrant, as the police dispatched by the court based on the address written in his complaint could not find him there. Defendants Zhang Zhongfu and Zhang Le's also remained in hiding. Only Zhang Xiaoxian turned himself in, stating that he is twenty years old, resides at No. 245, Securities Building, Hankou Road, and is studying at the exchange. The plaintiff is his grandfather, now seventy-three years old. Since the store closed, he does not know where his grandfather lives. There is property in their ancestral home, and his parents had asked him to return home, but his grandfather did not want to go back. He also does not know where his parents currently reside. The court told him, "According to the plaintiff's complaint, all the property has been sold by your parents, and now they have abandoned him and do not care about his whereabouts. As a son and grandson, you should know the importance of roots, how can you be so indifferent? Where do you currently live, and where are your parents? You cannot claim ignorance." Xiaoxian then said that his grandfather had taken a concubine, and she had given birth to a son. He heard that his grandfather was living with the concubine, but he did not know where. The court then ordered further summons.</p>
<h3>Cao Zhengyang Reads Under the Window: Assassinated by an Enemy: The Assassin Fired Two Shots in a Row; Widow and Children Arrive to Report the Case</h3>
<p>Cao Zhengyang, a 35-year-old from Funing, driver No. 513 of the Public Concession Tram Company, residing at No. 9, Branch Road of Robison Road, Caoyadu, West Shanghai, returned home from work at 10:30 PM the night before. While reading by the window, he was assassinated by an enemy who fired two shots in a row. One shot hit his left chest and exited through his back. The assassin fled. The Caoyadu Sub-bureau sent Cao to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but he died yesterday. The local police reported the case to the District Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Lei and Investigator Shen to the scene for examination. Cao's widow, Li, brought her two sons and one daughter to the scene and pleaded for justice. After the official ordered the examination, he instructed the body to be collected and authorized the arrest of the perpetrator.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 Workers at Meiwen Silk Factory Plead Injustice for Zheng Lianfu: Unanimously Sign to Prove Zheng Was Framed: Case Concluded by the Court, Sentencing on the 26th</h3>
<p>Zheng Lianfu, a Chaozhou weaver at the Meiwen Silk Weaving Factory, No. 15, Lane 645, Changping Road, West Shanghai, was arrested by two Chinese constables, Nos. 674 and 1986, at 5:05 AM on the 13th of this month near the intersection of Changping Road and Hart Road, on suspicion of suspicious behavior. A packet of white powder, resembling a poisonous substance, was found in the left pocket of the Yuan-colored short shirt Zheng was wearing. He was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. Subsequently, a Chinese and Western detective searched Zheng's home at No. 359, Lane 679, Xiaoshadu Road, and found another four packets of the same white powder, each containing ten small packets, and an iron can of white powder resembling baking soda, totaling seventeen pounds, under the bed in a small mesh basket. These were all sent to the First Special Court. Zheng denied the charges in his testimony, claiming that he was framed by his fellow villager Zhang Caibao due to a grudge. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation. The details were published in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. However, more than 400 male and female workers from the Meiwen Silk Factory, believing that Zheng Lianfu had been working at the factory for nine years and had always been honest and hardworking, felt that he was being wrongly accused. They were outraged and unanimously signed a petition to guarantee Zheng Lianfu's innocence. In addition to appointing lawyers Shi Liang and Huang Xiubo to appear in court to vigorously defend Zheng, they also went on strike yesterday and flocked to the court. Due to limited space in the courtroom, only a portion of the workers were allowed to enter to observe the proceedings, while the majority waited outside the court for news. First, the lawyer for the police station, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the case was being postponed, and that the white powder confiscated by the police station had been sent to the Public Works Department's Hygiene Department for testing. The test results showed that the white powder was indeed a compound of morphine and caffeine. The seventeen pounds of white powder were lime. It was also found that the defendant had no habit of smoking opium and was definitely not using it himself. Therefore, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 263 of the Criminal Law for possession of poisonous substances. The police also investigated the defendant's claim that he was framed by Zhang Caibao. However, the defendant could not provide Zhang's address, so it was impossible to confirm whether Zhang Caibao existed. However, the Jiaozhou Road Park Police Station sent officers to investigate and claimed that the defendant often went to the park to practice boxing. When questioned, the defendant still claimed that he did not know the source of the poisonous substance and feared that he had been harmed by others. Subsequently, the Western detective and Chinese constable No. 674 successively provided evidence to prove the circumstances of the search. Finally, after arguments from the lawyers on both sides, Judge Huang ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending sentencing on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Argument Over Rent Leads to Scuffle; Woman Miscarries: Examination Reveals No Fetus in Blood Clot; Defendant Feng Zhang's Case Investigated and Retried</h3>
<p>Lu Zhongkui, a local from No. 67, Father Lao Road, French Concession, is nearly thirty years old and works as a vendor. He married Chen, a woman from Chongming (26 years old), who has recently stopped menstruating for four months and is suspected of being pregnant. The Lu couple moved out of the remaining house of their neighbor Feng Ziying at No. 65 and rented No. 67 next door ten days ago. On the morning of the 18th of this month, Lu Chen and Feng Zhang, wife of the previous landlord Feng Ziying, had an argument over the previous rental agreement, which escalated into a scuffle, causing Lu Chen to be injured, her pregnancy to be threatened, and severe abdominal pain. Her husband, Lu Zhongkui, reported the incident to the French Police Station, which detained Feng Zhang for investigation. Chen was sent to Guangci Hospital. After being admitted, Chen's abdominal pain worsened, and she expelled a blood clot, suspected of being a miscarriage. The police, considering the seriousness of the matter, sent the blood clot to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren and Medical Examiner Wei were dispatched by the Special Second Court to the funeral home for examination. The blood clot was placed on straw paper and put in a spittoon. After being washed with clean water, a detailed examination revealed no fetus in the blood. It appeared to be several months of old blood, the remains of menstrual flow, after which the blood had dissolved. The official questioned Lu Zhongkui, husband of the victim Lu Chen, and the defendant Feng Zhang, about the circumstances of the argument and scuffle. The official then announced that the examination showed a blood clot with no fetus inside, and the defendant was handed over to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>North Station: Large Amount of Counterfeit Money Confiscated</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai North Station of the Jinghu Railway, around 3:30 PM yesterday, police officer Yuan Xiaoban, on duty at the North Station Sub-bureau, was inspecting passengers when a man, about forty years old, with an Anhui accent, wearing a Xiang gray long gown and a Xiang gray felt hat, carrying a leather suitcase, entered the station through the east gate in a flustered manner. The police officer approached him for inspection. The passenger falsely claimed that the key to the suitcase was with his wife and that he would go get it. He asked the officer to watch the suitcase. However, the passenger never returned. The police officer, sensing something was amiss, managed to open the suitcase, which contained fifty large bundles of counterfeit two-yuan bills from the Chinese Farmers Bank, each bundle divided into ten smaller bundles, totaling 25,000 counterfeit bills, worth 5,000 yuan. It also contained a Qing gray cloth camel wool long gown and a gray cloth jacket. These items were taken to the sub-bureau and transferred to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiuzhou Pharmacy: Fire Injures Two People</h3>
<p>The Jiuzhou Pharmacy at the Dongxinqiao intersection of Zhejiang Road suddenly caught fire around 11:00 PM yesterday, immediately erupting through the roof with unstoppable force. The pharmacy's front and rear buildings were rented to others, who were all asleep at the time. They were awakened from their dreams only when the fire reached them. The stairs were already burned through, leaving them nowhere to escape. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade quickly arrived with fire trucks, allowing them to escape. However, an elderly woman from Suzhou, Wang Yu, 53 years old, and a local man, Zhu Mingkun, 51 years old, had already been burned. They were taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Wang Yu suffered injuries to both feet, with her flesh blurred, likely resulting in permanent disability. Zhu Mingkun suffered injuries to his head and hands, which were relatively minor and expected to recover safely. The fire was extinguished in about half an hour. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau: Repairing the Wusong Wenzaobang Bridge</h3>
<p>The Wusong Wenzaobang Bridge in the Wusong District is a major artery for traffic between Wusong and Shanghai. Previously, due to years of corrosion, the Public Works Bureau ordered its reconstruction in 1931. Unexpectedly, the project was destroyed by the January 28th Incident shortly after its completion. Later, during the Japanese occupation of Wusong and Shanghai, although it was slightly repaired and once renamed "Shirakawa Bridge," the materials used were ultimately flimsy. The bureau repeatedly dispatched workers to repair it to maintain traffic, but the wooden structure of the bridge was easily damaged after the war, and the bridge deck often came loose. Vehicles passing through were cautious. The bureau repeatedly received requests from merchants and residents to rebuild it, and considering the potential traffic disruption, repeatedly petitioned the municipal government for funds. However, due to limited funds, the project was delayed. Recently, the bureau finally raised some funds to replace the bridge deck and beams. It also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing them to pay attention to traffic at that location. During construction, vehicles were only allowed to proceed slowly in one direction at a time to avoid affecting the work.</p>
<h3>Appeal in Prostitution Case Rejected</h3>
<p>Famous prostitute Qin Mei Lao Jiu Song Xiaodi was previously elected as the head of the prostitution department by the Shanghai Disaster Relief Association. She previously accused pimp Yang Shengji (Yang Baosheng) of undermining public morals to the police. The police filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court, which sentenced Yang to six months in prison. Yang appealed the judgment to the Second Branch of the High Court, which has now concluded its hearing. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for sentencing. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian also appeared in court. Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhong and Zhou, ascended the bench and announced the main text of the judgment: the appeal was rejected. If he chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. They then adjourned the court.</p>

<h3>News of the Commercial Press's Relief for Former Employees</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press's former employees requested relief from the press, and the Shanghai Municipal Government mediated and approved a loan program, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that the loans will begin to be issued on the 25th of this month. However, the number of applicants is large, and it will not be possible to complete the process in two or three days. To avoid congestion, it has been decided to process the applications in batches each day, limited to 200 people per day. Regarding the photos and insurance policies originally deposited by the former employees at the press, the press believes that retaining or returning them is irrelevant. Therefore, if the former employees request their return, the press is willing to comply. Otherwise, they may remain at the press.</p>
<h3>The First Special District Municipal Federation Held Its First Standing Committee Meeting the Day Before Yesterday: Lin Kanghou Elected Chairman by Ballot</h3>
<p>The First Special District Municipal Federation held its first standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Standing committee members Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Jicheng, Xu Xiaochu, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, and Cao Zhigong attended. Directors of various departments, Chen Jiufeng, Liu Zhongying, Tao Leqin, Zhu Yutao, Yu Yaoqiu, Zhu Wu, Wang Longzhang, Wang Zhaocheng, and others were also present.

<h3>China Merchants Bureau: Improving the Ningbo Route's New Jiangtian Steamer</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau is actively reorganizing its steamships. Since changing the Yangtze River steamers' business to a package system, passengers buy tickets according to their berth, and the ships are clean and comfortable, an unprecedented innovation in Yangtze River steamers. Now, the company is taking it a step further by adding wireless radios to the Yangtze River ships' ship department. The Jiang'an steamer has already been fitted, and the others will be fitted soon. All first, second, and third-class cabins will have them, and they can receive foreign music and singing to increase passenger interest. As for the Ningbo route's New Jiangtian steamer, a large sum of money was spent to thoroughly renovate it. The factory overhaul will soon be completed. The fourth-class cabin space has been expanded, and passenger seating has been added, eliminating the old habit of squatting on the floor. Wireless radios have also been installed in all first, second, third, and fourth-class cabins, allowing passengers to receive music and singing from various countries, so that passengers are not bored during the voyage. It is scheduled to resume service on Saturday, operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line.

<h3>Shanghai West Route One: Extending the Public Bus Route</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Route One public bus (IAS) originally ran from Jing'an Temple to the corner of Daxi Road and Kaixuan Road.

The original route from Jing'an Temple via Daxi Road to Kaixuan Road will now be cancelled and replaced by a route from Jing'an Temple via Jing'an Temple Road, Daxi Road, and Columbia Road to Fahua Road.</p>
<h3>Lianqing Society Charity and Friendship Meeting: Fundraising to Maintain Children's Clinic and Establish Children's Playground</h3>
<p>The Lianqing Society's planned friendship meeting is proceeding actively and with great effort. It is scheduled to be held on June 3rd at the Paramount Ballroom. Its main purpose is to raise funds for the children's clinic that has been established in Wuzhen Road, Zhabei for nine years. At the same time, to prevent disease, a children's playground will be established in the Pingmin Village on Zhongshan Road. The village was initiated by Mayor Wu, and most of its residents are poor. If a playground is established, it can cultivate healthy children, allow them to understand the interest in sports, and prevent them from loitering in the streets and facing various dangers. If this place is successful, others can be established in succession, so that children in Shanghai can get what they need. The society's move has been warmly supported by Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Yu Hongjun, and Zhu Boquan, who have agreed to be patrons and jointly support the event. It is said that it will begin at 8:30 PM that day, and there will be over a thousand valuable gifts donated by various manufacturers, which will be distributed to the participants by lottery that day. Everything is proceeding very smoothly. According to Commander-in-Chief Hao Boyang, as of now, 5,000 yuan has already been donated, and the remaining amount should not be difficult to raise. Meal tickets are sold for five yuan each, and lottery tickets are sold for one yuan each. Lucky tickets with five numbers each are sold for four yuan.

Yu also attended the meeting in person yesterday, and due to the serious national situation and the sluggish market, he humbly declined repeatedly. However, those present believed that Mr. Yu was highly respected and should be celebrated together.</p>
<h3>Robbers Impersonating Detectives Arrested</h3>
<p>Near the Bu Lin Li intersection on Avenue Edward VII, four men were loitering around 8:00 PM last night, and were even searching pedestrians one by one, claiming to be police detectives. Unexpectedly, Constable No. 185 of the French Police Station happened to be passing by and saw the situation. Believing that the men were not detectives and dared to act in this way, they must be planning a robbery. He immediately approached them for questioning. The men knew that things were not going well and scattered and fled. The constable was unable to chase them down, so he drew his gun from his waist and fired a shot, knocking down the last man. The bullet hit his leg, but he was not seriously injured. He was arrested and taken to the Grand Bell Police Station for questioning. He confessed that his name was Wei Fugeng, 32 years old, from Wuxi, and admitted that he had conspired with others to search pedestrians and attempt to rob them. He also revealed the surnames and addresses of his accomplices. The police station dispatched detectives to arrest them at the addresses. The suspect was sent to the hospital for treatment, pending the arrest of the remaining accomplices for joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Tao Wuzhi and Others Countersue: Zheng Haiting's False Accusation Established: Sentenced to Four Months in Prison, Suspended for Two Years</h3>
<p>Zheng Haiting, a Chaozhou native currently residing at No. 23, Lane 537, Julai Road, previously rented a house at No. 11, Lishui Lane, Danshui Road, managed by the rental department of Tao Wuzhi Law Firm. When he moved out in April of last year, he still owed four months of back rent from September to December of 1934. After Lawyer Tao sued for recovery, the Third Branch of the High Court ruled that he was obligated to pay. However, Zheng Haiting, in an attempt to evade the owed rent, became angry and falsely claimed that the newly signed rental contract was forged. He hired Lawyer Zhu Lanjia to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court of Shanghai, accusing Tao and Pan of forgery of private documents, defamation, fraud, and perjury. Tao and Pan also filed a countersuit accusing Zheng Haiting of false accusation. The result was a judgment that both sides were not guilty, the details of which have been published in various newspapers. Subsequently, Tao and Pan were dissatisfied with the countersuit portion and hired lawyers Sha Qianli, Zhu Wende, Ma Pingxun, and Yang Tianxun to separately file an appeal, requesting compensation for reputational damages of one yuan in national currency to the Third Branch of the High Court. The court held repeated hearings, and the countersuit attorneys Sha, Zhu, Ma, and Yang sternly refuted Zheng Haiting's ambiguous allegations and presented the reasons for the countersuit. On April 25th, at 9:00 AM, the court declared the arguments closed. A few days ago, the court sentenced Zheng Haiting to four months of imprisonment with a two-year suspension for false accusation.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Initiates Exhibition of Ceramic Art Pieces – Opening Set for the Day After Tomorrow at the Shanghai YMCA – Wu-Yue Historical Geography Research Association to Be Established Simultaneously</h3>
<p>A report from the Huadong News Agency states that the Wu-Yue Historical Geography Research Association and the Ceramic Art Piece Exhibition, initiated and organized by Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Zhihui, Ye Gongchuo, and others, have been fully prepared. The opening is scheduled for the day after tomorrow (Sunday) at the New YMCA on Route Pottier. The exhibition will be open to the public for one day, and the inaugural meeting of the association will be held at the same time. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited yesterday and observed that the exhibition pieces are divided into two major parts, pottery and porcelain, all of which are exquisite and rarely seen by the public. Classified by pattern, there are more than fifty types, including Song Dynasty porcelain, which was tribute porcelain presented to the government during the Southern Song Dynasty, shaped like a plate with lotus leaves and a small turtle painted in the center. There are also several types of tiles from the Spring and Autumn period. These tiles were recently discovered by Wei Juxian of the association on the beach at the Zhapu station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. According to Wei, researching these tiles is sufficient to prove that the cultural level of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces during the Spring and Autumn period was higher than that of the northern regions, possibly by three thousand years. At that time, people in the north mistakenly regarded Jiangsu and Zhejiang as barbarian lands and did not pay attention, so archaeologists generally neglected them as well, which is a great mistake. This exhibition is only open for one day, and the public may inevitably feel regret. In order to promote the general interest in historical geography research, the association will donate all the exhibits to the Municipal Museum for long-term exhibition after the exhibition closes.</p>
<h3>Electric Pole Fires on Route Lyautey – Two Apprentices Injured at Shun Kang Electrical Shop</h3>
<p>At approximately 10 PM last night, a fire broke out due to an electric pole on Route Lyautey, at No. 10, Shun Kang Electrical Repair Shop in the French Concession. The fire quickly spread to the adjacent walls, becoming uncontrollable. Two apprentices, Wu Baogen and Chen Yonggui, were injured on the spot. Because the fire station was nearby, the fire brigade quickly dispatched a fire engine to the scene and extinguished the fire in about an hour. As a result, a three-story building was burned down. The injured were rushed to Guangci Hospital by ambulance for treatment. Zhang Wenji (from Ningbo), the owner of the shop, was detained at the Songshan Road Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Liansheng Dies of Stroke After Prostitution</h3>
<p>Zhu Liansheng, a 42-year-old man from Ningbo, was the general manager of Ruifeng Transportation Company on Yuanmingyuan Road in the International Settlement. The night before last, Zhu went to a high-class brothel in Fuzhi Lane on Fuzhou Road with friends. After soliciting prostitutes and drinking, they played card games until noon yesterday. Unexpectedly, Zhu, who was in poor health, overused his brain and suffered a stroke. The brothel and Zhu's friends were shocked and immediately sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, his condition was too severe, and he died. His body has been transferred to the Siming Gongsuo for encoffining.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Counterfeit Coins Seized</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:20, Liu Chunshu, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Liu Zhisheng and Pan Yunlong, learned that someone was privately hiding a large quantity of counterfeit coins in house No. 83, Lane 533, Tonglu Road, for profit. They secretly went there with Western detectives and arrested four people: Zhang Chengbiao from Shandong, Chen Hongfang from Qingkou, Diao Yunzhang, and a woman named Gao Tian. In a box, they found 978 counterfeit 5-cent coins of the Central Bank wrapped in white cloth. They were taken to the police station. Another counterfeit coin of the same type was found on Zhang's person. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 Court. Zhang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the seizure and presented the evidence for inspection. Zhang Chengbiao confessed that he had recently received 250 yuan from a friend surnamed Yu in his hometown and came to Shanghai with Chen Hongfang, staying at Diao Yunzhang's house. Diao introduced him to Li Si, a coolie at the Gonghexiang Wharf, from whom he purchased 1,000 of these counterfeit coins for 175 yuan. Twenty-two coins were deducted, and he planned to take them back to his hometown to use them. Chen Hongfang confessed that he knew nothing about the counterfeit coins and that he came to Shanghai with Zhang because he was related to Diao Yunzhang and stayed at his place. Diao Yunzhang and Gao Tian's confessions were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Xie Sanyuan Doused with Acid by Enemy</h3>
<p>Xie Sanyuan, a 21-year-old local woman, lived upstairs at Qiantai Trading Company at the entrance of Wufu Lane on Nanjing Road. She was beautiful, flirtatious, and often associated with hooligans, attracting attention and engaging in romantic affairs. This was her usual way of life. Yesterday evening around 10 PM, Xie Sanyuan was dressed up and about to go out for a walk on the street when a man suddenly jumped out from behind her at the entrance of Wufu Lane. He held a bottle, uncorked it, and poured the liquid inside all over Xie Sanyuan's head before running away. Xie Sanyuan immediately felt unbearable pain and her skin quickly turned black and charred. A pungent smell filled the air, and she realized she had been doused with acid. She screamed for help, but by the time the police arrived, the assailant was long gone. She was taken to the hospital by car for treatment. Although her life was not in danger, she would never have her former beauty again.</p>
<h3>Shen'ai Steamer Crashes into Hongsheng Wharf – Losses Extremely Heavy</h3>
<p>The Shen'ai steamer, managed by the Yilong Shipping Company, with a carrying capacity of 3,500 tons, usually sails on the Shanghai-North China route. Yesterday afternoon at 2:50, the steamer was arriving from Qingdao and headed to the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to turn around in order to dock and unload cargo. Due to careless navigation, the ship crashed into the Hongsheng Wharf, breaking the pontoon dock (also known as the floating wharf). The lower level of the pontoon dock immediately flooded. The force of the impact also broke two large iron chains that held the pontoon dock in place. Two floating bridges on either side were submerged in the water. Other buildings on the wharf were also damaged. The extent of the damage was unexpected. The Shen'ai steamer itself suffered minor damage. After the accident, the Hongsheng Wharf staff immediately notified the Sanbei Company. The manager of Hongsheng was also at the company at the time. Upon receiving the report, the company instructed the wharf at 4 PM to temporarily detain the owner of the Shen'ai steamer to conduct an investigation to determine responsibility and losses. At 5:30 PM, Yu Shunmao, the manager of Sanbei, along with the surveyor Sheng Pinru and the manager of Hongsheng, went to Pudong to conduct an investigation with the owner of the Shen'ai steamer to assess the damage and find ways to repair it.</p>

<h3>Flourishing Incense – Zhurong Visits Tianzhu Nunnery – Three Buildings Burned Down</h3>
<p>The Tianzhu Nunnery, located east of Tangqiao in Pudong, has a total of five buildings and two bungalows. The main hall houses a statue of Guanyin, the front hall houses a statue of Zhaotianhou, and the east wing houses a statue of Liu Zhiyuan. Dozens of Arhats are placed upstairs. The nunnery has a history of hundreds of years and is close to the Tangqiao police station. Yesterday morning at 1:30 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the northeast corner of the upstairs east wing. The police station discovered it and immediately notified the fire departments, but it was too late to put it out. The fire brigades of the Pudong District and the Yangjing Town each rushed a pump truck to the scene. The fire was raging, and the firefighters worked hard to extinguish it. It gradually went out after burning for about an hour. Three buildings were destroyed, but the remaining buildings were saved. It is reported that the cause of the fire was due to the remnants of unextinguished paper ingots from the previous days of the lunar month, when incense was particularly popular.</p>
<h3>Fire in Old Lumber on Dajing Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 4 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the pile of old lumber in the bamboo shed in the wasteland at the intersection of Qinglian Street and Dajing Road in the city.

It is estimated that the old lumber burned on the site was of considerable value.</p>

<h3>Reduced Cricket Shipping Costs on Two Railways</h3>
<p>The transport of crickets (commonly known as "jiaogēgē") on the two railways is quite common during the summer. They are mostly transported by passenger train from Zhenjiang and Jiaze to the Shanghai North Station and then sold to the interior. However, these crickets need to be packed in bamboo cages, and the freight is calculated according to the volume of the package transport, which is inevitably slightly high. On July 12 last year, at the fourth passenger transport meeting of the two railway traffic offices, the Beijing-Danyang-Suzhou-Songjiang sections proposed a temporary resolution. In order to attract the transport of these crickets and increase revenue, it was decided to change the fee to be based on actual weight to reduce costs. The Railway Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for approval. Now, Instruction No. 4550 has been received, approving the trial implementation. The Traffic Office has been instructed to comply.</p>
<h3>Yili Steamship Makes Exceptional Progress</h3>
<p>The Yili Steamship operates between Shanghai and Wenzhou, departing from Shanghai every Thursday and from Wenzhou every Monday. It calls at Dinghai, Kanmen, Yueqing, and other ports along the way. The ship has always been the best merchant ship on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. The cabins are spacious, and the voyage is stable and fast. Since it has been managed by the Tianxing Shipping Bureau, the business has improved even more. The cabins of all classes are very clean, and the stewards are attentive and courteous. The loading and unloading of goods are also reliable and accommodating, ensuring customer satisfaction. In short, the ship has none of the usual bad habits for passenger and cargo transport. The company welcomes written suggestions from passengers and merchants regarding business improvements. Therefore, merchants traveling to and from praise the ship.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The forecast issued by the Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong is overcast and sandy with strong northwest winds, due to a low-pressure system passing through Manchuria and moving eastward. The Yangtze River midstream and between Hankou is still clear and fine, but will gradually change with southwest to northwest winds. The Yangtze River downstream and here is clear, gradually clouding with strong southwest to northwest winds. The East China Sea and Taiwan are overcast with southeast to northeast winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 80.2 degrees and the lowest was 50.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 86.7 degrees and the lowest was 65.7 degrees.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Color Printing Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>– Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview No. 25)</p>
<p>4. Inks and Printing Presses – Color printing requires many raw materials, such as lead sheets, rubber sheets, felt blankets, glass marbles, glass sand, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid, but the most costly and largest items are paper, inks, and printing presses. Regarding paper, this office has already documented it in the article "Shanghai's Paper Industry." Now, only the inks and printing press sections are attached for reference by those concerned about the color printing industry.</p>
<p>Inks: As the cultural sector of our country becomes increasingly developed, the import of inks is also gradually increasing. Initially, only black ink was imported, but later, various colored inks were also imported. Black ink is used exclusively for black lithographic printing, and those manufactured by Chinese ink factories can also be used. Although Chinese ink factories can also manufacture colored inks, their products are still difficult to match with foreign goods. American inks are the best in colored inks, followed by Japanese inks. The first company in this city to operate in American inks was Hengfeng Company on Sijing Road, and it seems that Lida Company is now selling more of it. Japanese merchants operating in inks in this city include Toyo Ink Company, Moroboshi Yoko, and Kurokoshi Company. The colored inks used by Chinese color printing factories are mostly Japanese goods, because the prices of Japanese goods are cheaper than American goods.</p>
<p>Inks are generally packaged in tin cans, each weighing one or five pounds. Recently, foreign goods have been partly packaged in barrels to reduce decoration costs, with wooden barrels used for those reaching 100 or 200 pounds.</p>
<p>The prices of inks vary, with American goods being the most expensive, Japanese goods being cheaper, and Chinese goods being even cheaper. The approximate market prices of Chinese goods and American and Japanese goods are roughly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Goods: 70-80 cents to 2-3 yuan per pound</p>
<p>Japanese Goods: 70-80 cents to 4-5 yuan per pound</p>
<p>American Goods: 1.2-2 yuan to 7-8 yuan per pound</p>
<p>It is said that foreign merchants also use credit sales methods, and the term is not fixed, but depends on the size of the printing house and its creditworthiness. Recently, small-scale factories generally use cash transactions when purchasing goods from ink merchants.</p>
<p>Printing Presses: The printing presses used by the color printing plants in this city are no more than two types: lithographic printing machines and rubber printing machines. Lithographic printing machines were initially used only for printing in black. In the early years of the Guangxu reign, the Shanghai Xujiahui Tushanwan Printing Plant had already used them. Lithographic printing machines were made of wood and turned by manpower, making printing extremely laborious. When the Dianshizhai Bookstore was opened, there were rotary lithographic printing machines, but the rotation was still done by manpower, with each machine requiring eight people, divided into two shifts, to rotate, still having the disadvantage of inefficiency. In the mid-Guangxu years, it was changed to use gasoline engines to replace manpower, but the machines were still as clumsy as in the past. The lithographic printing machines used in color printing today are hundreds of times more flexible. Among them, British goods are the best, followed by Japanese goods. Those imitated by the Chinese Mingjing Factory are also very exquisite and are favored by printing factories. In addition, Daqing Factory also produces them.</p>
<p>Recently, the printing industry has been purchasing rubber printing machines, and lithographic printing machines seem to be outdated, but it is more convenient to use lithographic printing machines for printing small quantities, so printing factories often have a small number of lithographic printing machines in addition to rubber printing machines. Lithographic printing machines are certainly not as sophisticated as rubber printing machines, and their production capacity is only 1,100 to 1,200 sheets per hour.</p>
<p>Rubber printing machines are best made by American Miehle. In Shanghai, only Hua Yi Printing Company and Hua Ye Printing Company each have one, because their selling prices are high and cannot be purchased by general small factories. Currently, the agents in Shanghai selling rubber printing machines include American Youlida Yoko, German Lihuo Yoko, Chansen Yoko, Japanese Hamada Yoko, Kiraku Yoko, Daipu Yoko, and Nakajima Yoko. The American Miehle sells for about 25,000-26,000 yuan per machine, while the half-size is about 13,000-14,000 yuan. Japanese goods are about 14,000-15,000 yuan for the full sheet and about 6,000-7,000 yuan for the half-size. More people usually purchase Japanese half-size frames. (End)</p>
<p>Supplement: From April 15th to 17th of last month, this office published Shanghai's Straw Hat Industry, in which the situation of Huitai Straw Hat Shop at No. 190 Beijing Road was recorded. Regarding the capital item, it was actually 70,000 yuan, not 30,000 yuan. This is specially corrected.</p>

<h3>Race Walking Trials for the World Games – Scheduled for Preliminary Selection – To Be Held on the 31st of This Month in the City Center – Registration Starts Today at Moore Memorial Church</h3>
<p>Due to economic limitations, only one race walker was originally planned to attend the World Games. After repeated requests from the Chinese Race Walking Association, the National Sports Association deemed it necessary to increase the number to two (including the previous one) and commissioned the Race Walking Association to select talent. It has been learned that the Race Walking Association has decided to hold the trials at 1 PM at the Shanghai Stadium at the end of this month (i.e., the 31st). The route will be the same as that set during last year's National Games: starting from inside the stadium, walking three laps around it, exiting through the East Command Platform gate, passing through Guohua Road, Fuxi Nei Road, Huanfu Dongnei Road, Fu Nei Zuo Road, Xiangyin Road, Jungong Road, Zhayin Road, and Minqing Road to Fu Qian You Road. A total of four laps must be walked around the route, and then it will return along the original route through Fu Xi Nei Road and Guoqing Road, entering through the East Command Platform gate and walking one more lap. The entire route is a total of 50,000 meters long. Anyone who has practiced race walking, has correct posture, and has a reasonable record can register with the secretary of the Race Walking Association, Lu Yutian, at Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road starting today.

<h3>Ten Province and City Literacy Education Discussion Concludes Yesterday; All Proposals Passed, Representatives Departed Shanghai One After Another; Decision to Organize the Chinese Literacy Education Research Association</h3>
<p>The literacy education discussion meeting convened in this city by ten provinces and cities, which began on the 19th, concluded yesterday. Except for Section Chief Zhong, the representative from the Ministry of Education, and the representative from Jiangsu Province, who had already returned and did not attend, all others were present.程时, Director Cheng of the Jiangxi Education Department, made a special trip to participate yesterday and reported on the special education situation in Jiangxi in great detail. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Discussion: Continued discussion began at 9:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Jiang Jianbai. Proposals from the administrative group: The proposal to combine voluntary education and literacy education was resolved to request the central government to order all primary schools to set up adult classes, the number of classes to be set up being directly proportional to the amount of funding. The proposal to organize a research association or discussion meeting among provinces and cities jointly implementing literacy education was resolved to be named the Chinese Literacy Education Research Association, with the representatives attending the meeting from various regions as the initiators. Proposals from the teaching group: How should the teaching methods for adult literacy education be researched and stipulated? Resolved: 1. Request the Ministry of Education to order the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to compile adult teaching methods for reference. 2. Civil education agencies in various provinces and cities should compile relevant adult teaching methods based on their experiences for mutual reference. 3. Adopt demonstration teaching to promote improvement. How should the testing methods and materials for literacy education be determined? Resolved: 1. The types of tests should include literacy education, including common sense guidance. 2. Testing methods should use test methods, materials, texts, and common sense. 3. Teachers and other personnel should be appointed to preside over the tests. Literacy education should simultaneously emphasize civic training and common sense guidance. Resolved: All implementing educational institutions should focus on instilling common sense in literacy education. In addition, add a civic training subject, using after-school or meeting time for spiritual talks or practical guidance. The materials should be compiled and provided by the literacy education authorities. How should literacy education materials be compiled? Resolved: To be continued by the Literacy Education Research Association. How should the supervision methods for literacy schools be stipulated in detail? Resolved: Research and refer to local supervision methods. All implementing literacy education institutions should find ways to continue training the public who have completed literacy education. Resolved: 1. Pay attention to cultivating students' interest in learning and the ability to self-study using reading tools during teaching, so that they can learn automatically after graduation. 2. Establish advanced literacy classes as much as possible within the scope of possible funding. 3. Use the learned characters as much as possible to compile readers suitable for the level of instruction, as materials for continued learning. 4. Agencies implementing literacy education should set up question-and-answer centers or reading clubs, etc., to be absolutely responsible for guiding learning. 5. Create an environment that requires literacy and facilitates learning, so that the public has the need and opportunity to apply literacy and learn literacy everywhere in practical life. In addition to establishing literacy schools, how should social methods be used to promote literacy education widely? Resolved: This case is related to the school system and education funding. Under organized training, it can be an aid to promoting literacy education, but it cannot be regarded as the main driving force. A letter requesting various film companies to produce literacy education films and solicit literacy education scripts to promote literacy education was approved.</p>
<p>Director Cheng's Report: Then, Director Cheng of Jiangxi reported briefly, stating that there are three types of special education in Jiangxi Province: The first is special education, namely, Zhongshan Public Schools; the second is simplified education in the provincial capital; and the third is province-wide school protection. The first type of special education does not focus on literacy. Literacy education has situational and local adaptability. The passive purpose of special education is to cultivate the national concept of the general public, and the active purpose is a new experiment in the primary school system. In Zhongshan Public Schools, there are public classes, children's classes, and women's classes. Children's textbooks focus on literacy, while adult textbooks focus on civic training. The school principal is also the leader. School teachers not only teach people to read, but also teach people to defend themselves. Therefore, when the communists came to areas where Zhongshan Public Schools were established, the people did not run away like in other places, and they could use the power of education to get close to the people. There are 14,000 graduates of Zhongshan Public Schools. The simplified education implemented in the provincial capital uses the most economical methods to achieve educational results, using junior teachers, middle teachers, and civil servants from various institutions as teachers. There are two slogans: those who do not know how to read should be taught, and those who know how to read should teach others. The public security bureau is used to force people to learn to read. There are 70,000 illiterate people in Nanchang, and it is planned to eliminate them in five years. The first four-month term had 4,800 graduates. Simplified education uses three methods: (1) Group teaching, using organized places such as factories, institutions, and schools to implement it, which is also literacy schools; (2) Door-to-door teaching, that is, going to homes to teach; (3) Self-study counseling, that is, self-teaching, by the householder or someone in the house who can teach on their behalf. The results of the teaching show that women are easier to teach and perform better. Moreover, the most successful people in the provincial capital are prostitutes. There are three to four hundred prostitutes, and more than one hundred have already graduated. The reason may be that prostitutes are younger and smarter. However, prostitutes mostly use the class teaching method. Among these three methods, class teaching is the best. Junior teachers are more responsible than middle school students, and they can teach everywhere without hindrance, making schools and families one. Therefore, the junior teacher system is still effective. The third type is school protection, that is, raising funds locally and establishing schools locally. Each insurance bureau establishes insurance schools, and each school sets up children's classes and adult classes. There are currently more than 27,000 insurance bureaus, and more than 12,000 insurance schools have been established in recent years, enrolling 290,000 children and more than 100,000 adults. In the past, there were more than 20,000 children enrolled, so the number has increased by 270,000 compared to before. Jiangxi has eight administrative regions, and three regions have already established training centers for insurance school teachers, with 3,000 trainees. There are currently 12,000 schools, an increase of more than 10,000 compared to before. It is planned to reach 27,000 in the future. There are two feelings from the implementation experience: (1) Education and politics must be united together; (2) Universal education cannot rely solely on educational institutions.</p>
<p>Visit Various Districts: After the meeting, a photo was taken at the municipal government. In the afternoon, literacy schools in Yinhang District and Datong District, labor literacy schools, the Shanghai West Experimental District, the municipal center area, the sports field, the library, the museum, the China Literacy Education Society, the China Vocational School, the Commercial Press, the China Press, the Mingxing Film Company, the Lianhua Film Company, the People's Education Museum, and the zoo were visited. Today, the representatives departed one after another.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Training Class to Go to Tianjin on the 26th for Competition; To Come to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 27th</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 21st - Our World Games track and field athletes, at the invitation of the Tianjin Sports Association, will be led by Captain Liu Changchun to Tianjin on the evening of the 26th. Starting at 9:00 AM on the 27th, they will compete against the winning athletes of the Tianjin International Track and Field Games at the Hebei Provincial Sports Field.

<h3>Random Notes on the European Tour of Our National Football Team; Written by Captain Li Huitang; From Hong Kong to Saigon</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM on May 5th, the French postal ship once again fired up and continued sailing south, heading straight for Saigon. After we waved our towels for the last time with those who were seeing us off, it was as if thunder was rumbling. We eagerly ran into the dining room to soothe our hungry stomachs. The dining room was full of flower baskets that people had sent to our team, and the fragrance was fragrant and the room was full of fragrance. Manager Huang has always been a big eater. This time he tasted French cuisine for the first time, and the same manager took care of him wholeheartedly. But everything becomes natural with habit. For several days, we have become a little accustomed to the unfamiliar and insufficient food, and we also feel that it is enough. In the dining room, we learned a few crude and uninteresting French words from the European servant, hoping that our brains and memory would not fail us, so that we could take them out and use them again when we get to Paris. Whether this dream can become a reality will only be clear in three months.</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Saigon, the sea route is more than 900 miles and takes three days and nights. This autumn voyage is leisurely and the sea is calm, which is considered our luck. No one felt the suffering of seasickness. We sat around chatting and laughing, playing chess and listening to songs all day long. On the first day, we had a general meeting to share the team affairs and responsibilities, taking the meaning of "many hands make light work." The luggage was managed by comrades Liang Shutang, Yang Shuiyi, and Zhuo Shijin, and the medicine box was assisted and kept by friends Li Guosan, Ye Beihua, and Jia Youliang. Later, the official jerseys brought from Shanghai were distributed. The numbers are sewn on the back of the jerseys, in the following order: Chen Zhenhe, Zhuo Shijin, Jia Youliang, Cai Wenli, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Li Huitang, Liang Rongzhao, Liang Shutang, Mai Shaoyi, Bao Jiaping, Sun Jinshun, Tan Jiangbai, Zheng Jiliang, Zhang Xianyuan, Cao Guicheng, Xu Yahui, Huang Jiliang, Huang Meishun, Yang Shuiyi. When we arranged the numbers, Little Bao happened to be number thirteen, which Westerners consider an unlucky number. Moreover, Little Bao is a goalkeeper, and the team's success or failure depends on the goalkeeper being unlucky. Therefore, there was a suggestion to cancel the number thirteen. Later, we thought that we Chinese have never regarded thirteen as unlucky, so we used it. Everyone laughed and dropped the subject.</p>
<p>On the third day of the voyage, the mountains and prisons along the coast of Annam were clearly visible. "The mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the boat." The misty rain stopped and fell from time to time, setting off the colorful rays of the sun into an interesting scene. After dinner, the boat had arrived at the mouth of the Saigon River. Since it was already night, we dropped anchor and waited to enter the port in the morning. Everyone complained that we had arrived too early and that the stay in Hong Kong was too short and the events were too rushed. The Saigon River is one of the famous rivers, with 99 bends. It is necessary to have a pilot to navigate here. It is a pity that we took this river at dawn, and the teammates who had never been to Saigon could not appreciate the scenery on both sides. Saigon is the number one port in Annam. Except for comrades Manager Huang, Zheng Jiliang, Zhang Xianyuan, Xu Yahui, and Jia Youliang, everyone else has performed here before. I myself am here for the sixth time. Revisiting the old place brings a little emotion of "the peach blossoms are still blooming." Saigon is a strange city where it always rains at least once a day. There are 60,000 to 70,000 overseas Chinese, and a total of 300,000 to 400,000 in Annam. Our country only established a consulate this year, but the French's politics are particularly autocratic. Overseas Chinese are in dire straits, and the Vietnamese people are even more miserable under their rule. Starting at 6:00 AM, looking out from the ship's window, a crowd of people welcoming us had been waiting on the shore, with banners waving, orderly and solemnly. We hurriedly put on our uniforms and coats and lined up like wild geese. In the midst of melodious music and applause, we landed one after another. Ms. Wang presented flowers on behalf of the overseas Chinese community. After the photo was taken, the ceremony was completed. The grandness of this ceremony and the enthusiasm of the welcome have never been seen before, which proves the sincere care and deep expectations of the bridge community here. We each carried small suitcases and drove straight to the Saigon Grand Hotel for a short two-day stay. The details of the war will be recorded in a special article.</p>
<h3>Interest from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to be Used for Education; Meeting to be Held Next Month to Decide</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The central government's Boxer Indemnity interest is to be used for educational subsidies. The 1.2 million yuan for the 24th year has already been allocated for use. The 25th year is approaching, and the amount requested for subsidies by all parties has reached 10 million yuan after months of statistics. Although the association's interest income for this year has increased compared to last year, it is only a few hundred thousand yuan. If the overdrawn subsidies from last year are deducted and repaid this year, the amount available for distribution is only about this amount. The detailed figures are being calculated. The association has scheduled a meeting of the Education Committee next month to discuss the allocation of subsidies, to be submitted to the Board of Directors for resolution.</p>
<h3>National Children's Book Exhibition Sets Performance Dates; Chahar Joins from Afar; Total of 158 People</h3>
<p>The opening date of the National Children's Painting Exhibition is approaching. In order to observe the children's ability to wield brushes for guests, the association previously set painting performance methods and welcomed children to come to the meeting to perform. According to reports from various provinces and cities, a total of 158 people have signed up to participate. Even Chahar, a distant border area, sent two people, showing admirable enthusiasm and perseverance. The association has properly arranged all performance dates and distributed them to various provinces and cities, requesting timely participation. The allocation method is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Also, the association received works from Hunan, Hubei, and Beiping yesterday, totaling 19 units. The judges are continuing to review them, and the display department is measuring the venue and planning the overall layout, all based on the principle of not being similar. As for all valuable materials, the Education Bureau's statistics department, including Shi Fuxing and Pan Youwen, are working on them. Furthermore, because the association's affairs are becoming increasingly busy, with many internal and external contacts, the original telephone is not enough, so another one has been installed with the number 77047 in this city.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes the Implementation of Zhuyin Hanzi</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the National Institute for Compilation and Translation, stating that the "Measures to Promote the Implementation of Zhuyin Hanzi" have already been stipulated to be implemented from July 1st of this year. As the implementation date is approaching, it is feared that primary schools, public schools, and printing shops may hesitate and delay, leading to errors. Therefore, in addition to issuing further orders to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct their respective primary schools, public schools, and printing shops to comply with the previous orders upon the deadline, the Institute is further instructed to review the newly compiled textbooks and pictorials for primary schools and public schools from July 1st of this year. It is imperative to comply with Article 5 of the previously promulgated "Measures to Promote the Implementation of Zhuyin Hanzi." Furthermore, the Ministry has already amended and promulgated the primary school curriculum in February of this year. These measures should also be amended accordingly to ensure uniformity. The phrase "Social Studies and Nature (or General Knowledge)" in Article 3 of the measures is now amended to "General Knowledge." The phrase "Social Studies (or Geography and History)" is amended to "Social Studies or Civics, Geography, and History)." The word "Hygiene" is also deleted. All are hereby notified. Attached is the amended "Measures to Promote the Implementation of Zhuyin Hanzi." Textbooks for public schools and short-term primary schools should use only Zhuyin Hanzi. The vocabulary list in the Chinese language textbooks for elementary schools should use only Zhuyin Hanzi. Textbooks for General Knowledge in elementary schools and Chinese language, Social Studies (or Civics, Geography, and History), and Nature in higher elementary schools should use only Zhuyin Hanzi. At the beginning of the first semester of first grade in elementary schools, Zhuyin symbols should be taught first. After sufficient practice, then standard Chinese characters should be taught. In the future, all newly compiled Chinese language textbooks for elementary schools should include a separate first volume before the first book, specifically using stories composed of Zhuyin symbols for teaching purposes. The teaching method should prioritize synthesis before analysis (phonetic exercises and recognition of individual symbols). The aforementioned provisions may be temporarily adapted by local educational administrative authorities in areas where there is a shortage of teachers proficient in teaching Zhuyin symbols. From July of the 20th year of the Republic of China, all newly compiled textbooks and pictorials for primary schools and public schools must uniformly comply with these measures; otherwise, they will not be approved. Normal schools at all levels in all provinces and cities should teach Zhuyin symbols so that normal school graduates have the skills to teach Zhuyin symbols. During the transition period, all primary schools must allocate a portion of time within the Chinese language subject to specifically teach Zhuyin symbols. From January of the 25th year of the Republic of China, all editors of children's and public reading materials must use Zhuyin Hanzi for printing. The Ministry and the educational administrative authorities of all provinces and cities should encourage newspapers to use Zhuyin Hanzi for printing as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>
<h3>City Library Opens Children's Reading Room</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Library, built in the city center, is located in front of the Municipal Government, between the left and right roads in front of the Government. The library building was completed last year. The architecture largely adopts a typical ancient Chinese style. The interior layout is extremely elegant and clean. The library can hold 500,000 books. Currently, it is collecting no less than 2,000 kinds of Chinese and foreign books, totaling approximately 20,000 volumes. Chinese and foreign magazines and newspapers have reached more than 300 kinds. Ordering foreign books and allowing them to be available for reading may take some time. Since Hong Kui, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, concurrently serves as the Director of the library, he has been actively managing it. The library's internal structure now consists of four departments: General Affairs, Compilation and Storage, Collection, and Circulation. It was formally established on May 1st. It is reported that the children's reading room will be opened in early June, and the reading rooms for books, newspapers, and magazines will be opened in early July. The lending of books will have to wait until the official opening ceremony.</p>

<h3>Liberation</h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>Amei delivered the meal to the wing room as usual and on time. This wing room was very large, housing three students: Old Li from the Literature and History Department, Old Wu from the Art Department, and Old Chen from the Political Economy Department.</p>
<p>Just as their majors differed, so too did their personalities, but they were all good friends and had never broken up over small conflicts. Old Wu, in particular, was like a woman, avoiding arguments and rarely discussing matters outside his field. He would often stare blankly at his old and new works on the wall, or dab a few strokes on the canvas, tilting his head to take a look... He was planning in his heart: If this painting is more brilliant, and I paint a few more, I can have a "personal exhibition," and if I had two or three hundred yuan... You two are useless fellows, watch me become famous!</p>
<p>Old Li liked to spout book cannons, reciting the "inspiration" and "description" of the Book of Songs with some vigor; he could also rattle off a few phrases like "de le na ma." Old Chen called him a "blend of ancient and modern" Mr. He also called Old Chen a "standing committee member of the National Government."</p>
<p>At half past eleven in the morning, Amei arrived with a flat bamboo basket for dishes and a copper basket for rice.</p>
<p>Old Chen was reading the newspaper, Old Wu seemed to be pondering something as he paced, and Old Li was practicing calligraphy in the style of Su Dongpo.</p>
<p>"The meal is here," Amei would always say as a greeting when she walked in.</p>
<p>"Set it out, set it out!" Old Li put down his brush and stood up, but he didn't clear the things from the table. As usual, he first opened the bamboo basket to see what dishes were in this meal.</p>
<p>"Amei! Do you want liberation?" Old Chen, still engrossed in the newspaper, turned his head and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"What liberation?" Amei asked, thinking he was joking again, but also somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you some good news," he said, retracting his gaze to the newspaper, scanning it, and saying: "According to the news... the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of the Interior to organize the registration of maids..." "Um, let me ask you first, how old are you really this year?"</p>
<p>"Let's eat! Nonsense," Old Li muttered as he walked over, and Old Wu also strolled over lazily.</p>
<p>"I don't remember clearly," Amei replied, her ochre-colored, coarse, thick face twitching slightly, with a hint of shyness.</p>
<p>"What business is it of yours how old she is? If your old woman were around, she would definitely..." Old Li hadn't finished rambling when Old Chen immediately interrupted, saying:</p>
<p>"You set the table! I'm not reporting to you."</p>
<p>They hardly ever set the table; Amei took care of everything. He asked Old Li to set the table, just wanting Amei to come closer and listen, but Amei was busy placing the food on the table.</p>
<p>"Let's eat! Let's eat!" Old Li pushed Old Wu, taking the lead to go over, and Old Wu followed, but Old Chen remained sitting on the edge of the bed, not putting down the newspaper.</p>
<p>Amei was about to leave with the basket, but the phrases "liberation," "Municipal Public Security Bureau," "Ministry of the Interior," and "maid registration" floated in her mind, slowing her pace. At the same time, she was stopped by Old Chen's command-like sentence: "Don't go yet! Listen to my report."</p>
<p>"No time, I won't ask you," he said. Seeing Old Li and Old Wu eating so ravenously, he was really anxious, but he wanted to make Amei happy with this news, so he used his combined method of political economy to say: "Well, let me tell you: 'Maids who have already registered will be unconditionally liberated and regain their freedom. If a maid is a minor and has no home to return to, or returns home but the family cannot afford to support her, she should be sent to the municipal relief home or other charitable organizations for placement...'" "Maids who are over sixteen and have no home to return to may be selected for marriage with their consent...'" "Maids who have been liberated and have no family or whose family's location is unknown may choose the head of a local relief home or other charitable organization as their guardian..."</p>
<p>He wanted to say a few more words to Amei, and Amei also wanted to ask him a little more, but the loss of food was too damaging to his "economic principles." He couldn't help but say "Finished, finished!" as the end and ran over to realize his stomach economy.</p>
<p>"You guys are too impolite! Like you're starving!" he scolded as he ate.</p>
<p>"Time is not economical, we also have classes to attend," Old Wu replied amiably.</p>
<p>"We don't spend time on useless things, we don't want to leave the meal for after class..." Old Li's blend of ancient and modern came out of the box.</p>
<p>"I'd rather hang your mother's gong than hang hers, don't be jealous!" Old Chen cursed, half in his throat.</p>
<p>"Who's jealous? Is that kind of woman worth me flirting with like you?" Old Li forgot the "mother" and refuted the latter part.</p>
<p>They had been living in this wing room for almost half a year. The wing room was located on the second floor of a Western-style building in a certain neighborhood. In addition to several wing rooms, there were also several attic rooms on the third and fourth floors, all of which were rented out. This building was Xu Mu's only property. In addition, Xu Mu also ran a large stove in her own home, providing meals for guests. Amei was her maid. Amei was bought and used by her when she was less than eight years old, and has been used ever since – now Amei is fifteen years old. In addition to helping her cook, Amei also specialized in delivering meals. Although Amei was already fifteen years old, she was still often afraid of being beaten and scolded by Xu Mu. She had tried to run away several times, but didn't know where to run to. She didn't know where her family was, only vaguely remembering that her father had been drafted into the army that was sent to fight in some city. He also remembered a large water buffalo, a fat pig, and several chickens that were all captured and slaughtered by the soldiers; her mother's crying that was like death! A few days later, she also helplessly went to collect firewood to maintain her livelihood, but finally could not withstand the pressure of rent arrears, tax arrears, and donation levies, and had to sell Amei. The impression of the final farewell will never be erased from Amei's memory – her mother, holding her breastfeeding younger brother, wiped her tears and told her: "Be good! Don't cry, when your younger brother grows up, Mom will ask you to come back and play."</p>
<p>At that time, Amei was just seven years old, but half a year later, the master went bankrupt due to gambling and sold her to Xu Mu.</p>
<p>Amei walked out of the building, both surprised and fearful, thinking wildly as she walked.</p>
<p>"This opportunity is so good!" she thought. "That's right, I want liberation, I want freedom! If not, I really don't know how long that old fox will trap me for, like Xiang Zi said about that Ma Gu who was still a maid at twenty-eight, not allowed to marry, and no one wanted to marry her, it's really pitiful. I'm fifteen years old, right? Xu old fox cursed: 'You're ten years old this year, and you still don't understand a bit of feelings!' Yes, I'm fifteen years old, fifteen years old... it seems I'm still considered a minor, right? Minor... Mr. Chen said: 'Minor, no home to return to... returning home without the ability to support... send to the municipal relief home, send to charitable organizations...'" "Hmm, what's it like to be sent to those places? Mr. Chen didn't explain, but I guess there's a bed to sleep in, and food to eat, right? Sleeping on a bed and not lying on the old fox's dog kennel floor, eating clean food and not eating the old fox's leftover cold dishes and hard rice isn't bad either. Next is: 'Over sixteen with no home to return to, with my consent... choose a spouse,' ha, that's not bad either, living with a husband, wouldn't that be even better? It's a pity I'm still a year away... so would it work to fake being sixteen? Anyway, being a year off wouldn't be noticeable...'" "And next,... I forgot, but that doesn't matter, solving those two is enough..."</p>
<p>Xu Mu, seeing her walking back slowly, pondering something blankly, was really so angry that she had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>"Rotten stinker! Did you meet a ghost? Why did you take so long?"</p>
<p>As if a ghost had really possessed Amei, the image that had never been shown before made Xu Mu shudder – her eyes were wide open, her gaze was like that of a wild cat radiating from its pupils in the dark, grinning, her mouth moving as if making some kind of demonstration. Xu Mu panted and stared, but tried to maintain her dignity.</p>
<p>"You really met a ghost! I'm not taking a plane to rush for you!" Amei said, then coughed fakely, tilted her face, and placed the basket heavily on the counter. Xu Mu's triangular eyes widened even more, and her bitter gourd-like long face was like it was being ironed by an iron, hot and spicy.</p>
<p>"Rotten stinker! Your ass had good fortune in a past life! Taking a plane!"</p>
<p>"But now I'm going to have good fortune, haha!..." Amei said, laughing like she was crazy for a while, then said: "I'm going to go to freedom, I'm going to go to liberation! Haha, haha!"</p>
<p>Xu Mu's jumping heart calmed down a little, but she was still angry. She thought Amei must have been deceived by someone. "Freedom" and "liberation" were the first times she had heard her say them.</p>
<p>"Hmph, freedom and liberation!" Xu Mu cursed in a contemptuous tone: "Think about your background! Your cheap bones will soon become immortal."</p>
<p>"Do you think Amei is really cheap to the end? You watch! I'm going to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to register!" Amei blurted out and was about to run out, and Xu Mu slapped her out of reflex, Amei's head flashed, and the slap missed. Xu Mu quickly picked up a bowl from the counter and threw it at Amei's back as she ran out. The bowl hit the corner of the door and shattered with a bang.</p>
<p>"This stinker is really dizzy with ghosts!" Xu Mu cursed, panting: "Going to the Municipal Public Security Bureau? Unless you become a prostitute! But even the tea boy at the Public Security Bureau wouldn't want your rotten pussy!"</p>
<p>She chased out the door, but Amei's shadow was like it had been taken away by a demon. She was both angry and strange, why did she want to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau? But she repeatedly thought in her heart: "Will the yamen of the officials let this dirty foot of a lowly person step in? Wait for you to come back wrapped in iron skin!..."</p>
<p>Yes, Xu Mu was too busy to read the newspaper – she never read the newspaper, maybe she was illiterate. She had also never heard such crazy news as Amei, perhaps because she had little social contact, and the guests who packed meals also didn't talk to her about it, and the guests didn't often come to sit and chat. Xu Mu walked back, picking up the shards of the bowl with what seemed like anger and hatred.</p>
<h3>When Feeling the Times, Flowers Shed Tears</h3>
<h3>Danshan Village Lane</h3>
<p>— Ya Nan</p>
<p>Danshan Village Lane is lively.</p>
<p>When the sun has not yet shone red light from behind Danshan on the east side; the white misty mountain fog covers the village, and covers the orchards outside the village Danshan Village Lane Danshan Village Lane. Seen from the mountain, this low white misty mountain fog is like a white gauze tent.</p>
<p>At this time, like going to the upper village, you will see farmers pushing wheelbarrows, coming out of the village lane. The wheels rumbling, leaving deep track marks on those yellow mud village roads. Donkeys carrying empty baskets on their backs, kicking the dirt at the fence gate with vigor. A group of people preparing to weed wheat in the fields, tightening their small cotton jackets full of dirt, looking up at the sky, murmuring: "Good weather, no wind." Picking up the hoe and rake beside the door, they left. A group of chicks "cooed" and flew out from the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>When the sun quietly climbs up the corner of the roof, the thatched roofs are all filled with white. Children in the fields are calling "Dad, it's time to eat."</p>
<p>The village lane then began to become lively.</p>
<p>The sound of children crying, dogs barking, girls chatting and laughing by the well, the sound of the mill grinding sweet potato dried slices, the sound of roosters chasing hens and flying in the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>Occasionally a car, or a bride walking down the street; the girls and children inside the doors, like a group of chickens in a chicken coop, all flew out. Staring with surprised and greedy eyes at the people walking past the door.</p>
<p>On the short doors of each house are pasted red paper spring couplets: "Plum shows snow's letting go, magpie heralds sunny chatter," "Three cups of strong tea talk of mulberry and hemp, a wisp of light truth leaving the times behind." Some even have small couplets pasted upside down: "Favorable weather for the crops," "Four seasons of peace." But others are not allowed to say that it is "upside down", otherwise they will be unhappy.</p>

<h3>The Eruption of Japanese Satirical Literature (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Japanese new literature, along with the unease of the times, presents signs of extreme crisis. From last autumn until now, there has been little literature that could be called progressively developing. If we force ourselves to examine the central point of discussion in literary circles, we can only point to incidents like "satirical literature" and "historical novels."</p>
<p>Indeed, since last autumn, satirical literature has swept through the entire literary scene, like the founding of the satirical arts magazine "Otsuzumi" (Big Drum), and the serialization of satirical poems by poet Oguma Hideo. The activity of Tsuboi Shigeji and Tsurumi Yuji, the recognition of Shishi Bunroku as a satirical writer with his work "Alley Dance Song," and the popularity of Takada Tamotsu, whose work "Kappa" reached a high standard of satire, cannot be denied as a phenomenon of the proliferation of satirical literature. In particular, the "Sarcasm Club," organized by progressive artists, poets, and writers specifically to create and promote satirical works, can be considered a new force in satirical literature.</p>
<p>Regarding this impression, we must first study the subjects they adopt and then examine their social basis. As far as I know, their subjects are mostly about the Abyssinian problem, cult problems, suppression of freedom of speech, the Teikoku Rayon scandal, and other social, economic, and cultural phenomena. Needless to say, these problems and phenomena are problems and phenomena of the current uneasy world, extending to Japanese reality. Because satirical literature is the offspring of realism and romanticism, it is bound to pay attention to these problems (due to the method of realism) and mock them (in the spirit of romanticism). But why doesn't new literature dare to attack head-on and instead adopts a satirical approach? This contains the significance of contemporary Japanese society. Eguchi Kan said in the February issue of "Social Commentary": "In short, when literature with progressive tendencies is suppressed by the political forces of the time and cannot express proper ideology, this literature breaks down and transforms in various directions. The weakest succumb to this pressure, dissolving their ideology, but those who are weak but conscientious and unwilling to degenerate retreat and become nihilists..." "And the strong, the part with rational (more than passionate) elements, cleverly avoid direct conflict with political pressure and attempt a surprise attack from the side, thus turning into satirical literature."</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Eguchi explains the social significance of satirical literature. Now let us observe the opinions of various Japanese scholars on satirical literature: Regarding satirical literature, the opinions of Japanese literary figures can be divided into two factions—the progressive writers and the pure literature writers. Within these groups, they can be further divided into affirmative and negative parties. Among the progressive writers, those who express affirmation (approval) include the members of the "Sarcasm Club." For example, Tsuboi Shigeji said: "When we look at the words of those who curse satirical literature, we can feel that they are completely the words of believers in feudal inferiority complexes; that is, they hold terror (to threaten themselves) towards those who can do new work that they cannot do themselves." However, the one who comparatively established the concept of satire can be said to be Honda Shūgo with his work "Satire and Laughter." He said: "Literature is entirely divided into three fields: lyric, drama, and epic. Just as songs need exaltation and joy, and elegies need sorrow, satirical poems need anger and contempt. In short, these two are the three major forms of lyric poetry." Indeed, when we look back at the great works of the past, they all contain the spirit of satire. Even the "Inferno" section of "The Divine Comedy" and the works of Gogol are good examples. The need for satirical literature is self-evident, and the core of the problem lies in how it is handled.</p>
<p>Now let's introduce the opponents of the progressive writers. The representatives of this faction can be said to be the critic Tobata Jun and Hayashi Fusao, but the latter does not always use a tone of abuse.</p>
<p>Tobata Jun said in the second part of "Literature as Thought," "On Satirical Literature": "Initially, I once said that satirical literature is necessary in a certain sense when one wants to rebel against the social order but still has to remain within a ring of the social order. This statement does not mean that the course of action taken by writers in this situation and literary figures in a broad sense is to say that within the same order. The objective conditions of this contradictory relationship of having to rebel against this order will inevitably produce satire and satirical literature. If it is a revolutionary practitioner, the 'satirical' reality is activated in the form of transformative activity, but since a literary figure is a literary figure, they can only approach this reality with so-called formal writing activity.</p>
<p>But if satirical literature is not a special style of expression based on perspective and writing method; but rather a general color of literature that inevitably arises when reality needs to be satirized, then in the modern world, is it not a bit abnormal to distinguish between satirical literature and non-satirical literature and to promote satirical literature?</p>
<p>In short, according to his opinion, there is no distinction between satirical literature and non-satirical literature. In the case where reality is "satirical," all literature is satirical, and satirical literature is an inevitable product of this "satirical" reality, with no need for promotion. This is a negation of the call for satirical literature in the current literary scene.</p>
<p>As for Hayashi Fusao, he is still full of his abusive heroic colors. He said that those who advocate satire are phenomena of their own pathology, and he said that those who advocate satire are undertakings of those who do not lead a normal spiritual life. In "Satirical Satire," he says: "Therefore, if you want to write satirical literature, then you need to organize a 'Dream Research Society' or something like that, because when you feel that the night in Tokyo is a bit neurologically deranged with all the tossing and turning, quickly ask the director of the mental hospital, Saitō Shigeki, to examine you. If the diagnosis is correct, then pick up the pen again." He also taunts satirical writers, saying: "Please read Gogol's biography! There is no one more annoying in the world than him. He is truly a synthesis of the sordid personalities of the characters appearing in 'Dead Souls' and 'The Inspector General.'"</p>
<p>"What about Swift (Jonathan Swift, the author of *Gulliver's Travels*)? Looking at his face, he looks like a toad that lives only on sorrow and hatred. Arrogant, ambitious, a strategist, he cannot eat unless he curses someone for a day... He himself was insane, so he felt that people were all insane, so at the time of his death, he left a will saying: 'All property should be used to build an insane asylum.'"</p>
<p>"As for Heine, that poisonous tongue is simply perverted."</p>
<p>The above is an example of Hayashi Fusao's hatred of satirical literature and further hatred of satirical literary figures. In fact, I read his "First Class Seat" two or three years ago, which is a satirical novel by a satirical writer league cadre, which is still deeply imprinted in my mind, but I don't know how Hayashi Fusao would explain this contradiction.</p>
<h3>May</h3>
<p>— Xijin</p>
<p>Let us commemorate, companions! May has</p>
<p>The scorching sun dries our blood;</p>
<p>Also in this moment we awaken,</p>
<p>That unexpected from the evildoers, a big startle</p>
<p>People regard May as ominous,</p>
<p>Yes, in this ominous month,</p>
<p>We have all raised the battle flag in our hearts;</p>
<p>Keep calm, you first look clearly,</p>
<p>The bloody May is preparing a bloody sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Journey</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Like a toad, living in a dark and humid small cave, without the sun shining on that small world, and without flowers and plants adorning that small world, people's sight becomes shorter and shorter, and people's lives become more and more monotonous. When I entered society from school, although that lonely and inexperienced temperament was somewhat incompatible with everything, like a monkey leaving a tree, losing its original support, that wild nature, the wandering life that was once practiced, was still retained in the ideal. After a few years of fixed life, piles of paper and ink scraps not only made a person's life boring, but also damaged that strong body. The first impression given to people is that haggard body, which seems unable to bear the heavy hard work. In fact, what meaningful things have I done in these years? I am an enigma to myself. At a certain time, following the tide of people rushing on the road, I went to a place; at another time, I followed the tide of people rushing on the road again to another place. What my eyes see is a group of gray people, and what my nose inhales is the polluted air of the city. That's all. This is life. But I always feel that life is not like this. What exactly is life? Maybe I know it, maybe I don't know it. Knowing or not knowing, in reality, it doesn't matter much, as long as a small fixed circle can determine a stereotypical person. That's what I think, and that's what I think, and I guess it's not too far from the truth. I can be sure of that.</p>
<p>May there be a little wave in life! The ideal is not extravagant, just a little, a little new stimulus, just give me a little new vitality. This is naturally also a dream. My physical illness causes psychological illness. I know that no small wave will cause much spiritual change, but a hope is always more beautiful than reality. Let the beautiful clothes cover my eyes and my ears, and let the bright thoughts pass through my gray thoughts and dark emotions. When I stepped into the Beijing-Shanghai train, the gloomy weather of half a month suddenly brightened, dispelling the gloom of my mood; the warmth of the climate also increased the speed of my blood. Strangers' faces feel kind, and noisy human voices feel pleasant. Time is approaching the beginning of summer, but spring's footsteps still linger on the earth. I breathe the heavy breath of spring. This breath is a bit tiring, but it does not make people unpleasant. The train speeds up, throwing the surrounding wilderness behind. The wilderness of Jiangnan originally has its special local color, that is, among the endless green wheat seedlings, sometimes there is a square of bright purple milk vetch, which makes the narrow and long wilderness next to the railway more beautiful, just like a woman occasionally wearing a bright flower under her dark hair, adding a lot of charm. After the car passed Zhenjiang, the mountains became more numerous, the water became longer, and the wilderness became narrower. The majesty of the river, the beauty of the mountains, the twilight of the wilderness, and the soft talk of the sparse passengers did not make people feel the loneliness of personal travel that they had expected when they first went out. The sun turned its blood-red world wheel, revealing half of its face from the black clouds hanging in the west. My eyes look at it squarely, and it will not shine as much as it did in the middle of the sky, making my eyes unable to open. The infinite goodness of the setting sun is probably in its accessibility. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. It finally gradually disappeared below the horizon from the green willows in the distance. The sunset of the first day was seen off like this on the Jiangnan Road. By the time I saw the sunset on the second day, it was already the yellow soil of the north. A vast and desolate plain unfolds. Only a few locust trees nearby and some alfalfa planted in the distance for future fertilizer have a little green. The earth is dim yellow, and the sun's rays are also dim yellow. The wheel-sized sunset is on the distant horizon. Because the car is moving rapidly northward, it looks like it is also moving rapidly northward, as if it is racing with the car. Finally, because it cannot overtake the car, it shyly hides underground.</p>
<p>After the sun went down, the vast and simple wilderness felt like there was nothing to see. I silently left the window and stepped into the dim sleeping car. Impressions that I had never seen before lingered in my mind. I took a pencil and wanted to write down these impressions. I wrote a few lines, but because the car was shaking too much and my hand was using too much force, the pencil tip suddenly broke. I took out my pocket knife, preparing to sharpen the pencil. When I opened the knife, I carelessly touched the blade with the second finger of my right hand, cutting off a large piece. At first, I didn't feel anything, but when I saw a round drop of blood, I realized that my hand had been cut. Looking at that bleeding finger, my heart froze. First, I wiped away some blood stains with the manuscript paper, and then I opened the box, took some cotton, gauze, and adhesive plaster, wrapped the cut finger, and then I felt annoyed and my hand was a little painful. I threw away the paper and threw away the pencil. I climbed onto the bunk, covered my head in the velvet blanket, listening to the monotonous and turbid train sound, and I felt very sad. At the same time, I thought of when I bought this pocket knife, a dear friend jokingly said to me: "Your knife is really sharp. Let me cut open your blood vessels and drink your blood!" Now my hand has been cut, and the blood has been shed, but even if my friend were next to me, I am sure he would not have the heart to drink my blood.</p>
<p>The shaking of the car, the pain of the hand, and the sadness of the mood could not make me fall asleep. I lifted the blanket and looked out the window. The night had covered the earth. Another day has passed. I unconsciously thought of a poem by Keats that I loved to read and had translated:</p>
<p>"Gone is the day, gone is all the sweetness thereof!</p>
<p>Sweet voices, sweet lips, soft hands, softer breasts,</p>
<p>Warm breath, faint whispers, consoling half-tones,</p>
<p>Bright eyes, elegant demeanor, slender waist!"</p>
<p>Withered are the flowers and their blooming beauty,</p>
<p>The beautiful scene before my eyes disappeared,</p>
<p>Disappeared sound, love, the pure white paradise—</p>
<p>Extinguished for no reason when dusk covered,</p>
<p>In a similar mood, I thought of similar sentimental words, and reading these similar sentimental words increased the sentimental component even more. I also hated these past dregs very much, but the power of these dregs stubbornly occupied my thoughts. If I were to list the qualities of an *intelligentsia* that a group of people scold, I would possess them all myself. If I want to cheer up, I should cut myself off from the past, I should clear up the dregs of the past, and I should let the emotions of the past die. There is still time, let me start over. 14th, Beiping.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Printed Piece Goods Affected by Smuggling, Prices Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn fluctuations were minimal, and the cotton cloth market was also calm. Manufacturers and dealers were consistently firm on prices, and actual sales were considered acceptable. Local dyeing factories continued to import Eastern goods such as Longtou, Lan Feiyu, Wufu Jixiang, and Jixiang brand fine cloth, Yanghe, Wufu Jixiang, and Huawu brand fine twill, and the factory's fine twill sold over 200 pieces. Due to a slight increase in sales of Sichuan and other colored cloth and colored twill, the sales conditions became more demanding, making it difficult for white goods sales to improve. Northern business saw only 200-300 more pieces of white heavy coarse cloth imported. Printed goods were heavily affected by smuggling, with only a small number of colored silk crepe purchases. Hopes for improvement were minimal. In the south, only the Fujian merchants slightly increased purchases of plain silk crepe, colored twill, bleached cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, with only 50-60 pieces purchased. Sales to Zhejiang and Jiangxi were relatively strong, with the factory selling over 200 more pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and plain silk crepe.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: American Kerosene Production Sets New Record</h3>
<p>Average of Over Three Million Barrels Per Day in Recent Weeks</p>

On the morning of the 20th, oil stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were weak.

<h3>Grains: Rumors of Factories Preparing to Deliver, June Wheat Flour Suffers Sharpest Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat flour market, after the opening in the morning, presented a picture of initial stability followed by a sudden collapse in all months. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago near-term up 90 cents, far-term up 30 cents; Canada up 10 cents. At the opening, sentiment was good due to the increase in foreign wheat. However, given the exceptionally good weather, reports of smooth progress for wheat from all regions, and the recognized fact that spot wheat flour sales were not smooth, sentiment was weak. Long positions were liquidated, and short positions were heavily increased. Therefore, the prices for all months gradually softened. By the opening in the afternoon, the June market was declining rapidly, like a river flowing downhill. Because of the relationship between new and old wheat, spot prices were ultimately higher than July. Under the current circumstances, there were rumors that factories in and out of the port were releasing as much wheat flour as possible in preparation for delivery. Therefore, the decline was severe, reaching a low of $2.9125. The far-term contracts declined by only 3-5 cents due to less competition from long positions. According to speculation in the industry, if spot sales do not pick up, June will inevitably suffer setbacks.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Suddenly Drops in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market initially presented a stable picture for all months after the opening in the morning. With foreign wheat quotations rising by 10-29 cents, market sentiment was cautious. The opening prices for all months were roughly the same as the previous day. However, the situation changed drastically by the opening in the afternoon. Because the wheat flour market had fallen sharply, and the weather was good, sentiment in the industry was uniformly weak. Furthermore, inland merchants came out to hedge their sales, so transactions were active for all months, and the market gradually softened. June fell by 8 cents, and the far-term contracts fell by 5-6 cents. Given the current environment, the market is expected to continue to decline. There have been few arrivals of spot wheat, and no deliveries have been seen.</p>
<p>The US government's weekly weather report for wheat was favorable. Short positions in May covered their positions. Dust storms occurred in several places, but they were not significant. After the sale of May contracts, hedging sales of new wheat months will make it difficult for prices to rise.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trader Sesame Prices Unchanged, Miscellaneous Grain Trade Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market was extremely quiet, and market sentiment was mostly weak and depressed. Total transactions included 110 bags of An Dong beans, over 1,100 bags of Du Dou Sha Huang, 100 bags of Harbin beans, 170 bags of Gu Zhen white sesame, and 1,000 bags of Chongming corn. In addition, He Yi Foreign Firm purchased 200 tons of foreign trader sesame at a price of $12.40 per original bag. It is possible that the situation abroad has slightly improved, and foreign firms have eased their prices, allowing the market to stabilize.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Feed and Thin Rice Still Have Outlets</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Gate) Yesterday, a total of nearly 20 barges arrived with over 4,000 shi of goods. Sales in this street were still dull. Baozi had 2,000 bags purchased by both Northern and Southern traders, all of which were high-quality feed, leading to a high and stable but weak market for thin rice.

<h3>Traveler's Rice Merchants Lower Prices Repeatedly, Leading to Slightly More Transactions on this Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were slight continued arrivals of traveler's rice, with more medium and lower quality rice from Jiangxi and Wen Tai seeking to be sold in Shanghai. Because the weather was already hot, the lower quality rice had already suffered from the heat. Merchants and warehouses were even more eager to sell. Prices for medium and lower grades fell by another small amount of half a dime, while the higher quality rice also fell slightly by 3-5 cents, not approaching a dime. Outlets to inland areas were dull. Yesterday, Quanzhou merchants purchased 200 bags of Zhejiang oil rice. Demand on this street was originally weak, but because traveler's rice merchants lowered prices to seek sales, there were slightly more transactions. The total amount of Jianghe rice sold was 5,557 bags, Zhejiang rice 200 bags, Wen Tai rice 250 bags, and Yuan rice 100 bags. Except for the Zhejiang rice, which was purchased by Quanzhou merchants, all were purchased by merchants on this street.</p>

Because it is the first batch of new goods, it is quite popular. Even before the goods have been picked up, small samples have been seen and sold in advance. It is said that the number plate has been opened at $101. With more ships arriving later, the market may prevent loosening. Because hot water goods are very prone to discoloration, they cannot be stored for long and must be sold as they arrive. The current popularity is only because traders intend to offer new goods.</p>
<p>Squid: According to a telegram from Hakodate, Japan, the new hot water goods are scarce this year due to unfavorable weather. In general, fishermen are eager for warm, sunny weather, so that compensation or a turnaround can be achieved. The date of arrival of the new goods in Shanghai is about mid-next month.

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Clarification of Ambiguities Regarding Gambling in Public Places</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Higher Court has submitted a request for clarification: If stores and residents openly gamble in public places under the pretext of wedding celebrations and birthdays, does this constitute the crime of gambling? Article 266 of the Criminal Code refers to objects for temporary entertainment. Are there restrictions and standards, such as mahjong and pai gow? The Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference has already resolved that gambling for money in public places should constitute a crime under Article 266 of the Criminal Code. The proviso in the same article refers to objects for temporary entertainment and is not related to what constitutes gambling paraphernalia. Indeed, if they are allowed to entertain and allowed to gamble, then it is of course permissible to not question what constitutes gambling paraphernalia. However, open gambling in public places should be prohibited by law. But I have a small doubt regarding these two issues.</p>
<p>Gambling for money openly in public places should constitute the crime of gambling, regardless of whether it is a store, a resident, or a wedding celebration. Anyone providing gambling should be prohibited. However, events such as weddings and birthdays are accidental, and guests are often bored. Gambling is used for entertainment, with money as the stake. The time is temporary, which is understandable. This is not comparable to those who invite friends and relatives to gamble and collect commissions. Furthermore, weddings and birthdays should be based on facts and not used as empty pretexts. The time should also be limited. It should not be permissible to use weddings and birthdays as an excuse to collect commissions and gamble.</p>
<p>Gambling for money openly in public places should constitute the crime of gambling. Conversely, gambling openly not in public places should not constitute the crime of gambling. But in reality, open gambling in private residences, inviting friends and relatives to gamble and collecting commissions, is not uncommon. If this situation is not stopped, it is not fair. But the occurrence of the facts is not in a public place but in a private residence. Should this behavior constitute the crime of gambling? Or should it not constitute the crime of gambling?</p>
<p>In short, the way of the king is nothing more than entering into emotions, and legislation should be lenient. If friends and relatives are invited to gamble and commissions are collected, it should be prohibited whether in a public place or not. If weddings and birthdays are used to entertain guests occasionally, it should not be prohibited whether in a private residence or not. Public places should also be regarded as exceptions.</p>
<h3>Hunting</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kang</p>
<p>When the wind and sand stopped blowing, the dark night quietly left the grassland. The silence was broken by the cries of livestock, and various sounds vibrated across the plains. Smoke rose from the Mongolian yurts and quickly enveloped the jujube trees. The burning livestock dung scattered everywhere, emitting a foul odor. The dogs ran wildly through the grass, barking fiercely with their dew-soaked bodies, as if trying to tear through the sky. The women finished their prayers and started preparing breakfast. The children cried and disturbed them. They put the meat into the pot, then quickly picked up the children and sat by the stove, cooking the fire with one hand and feeding the children with the other. The dung smoke blew on their faces, but they couldn't smell the odor at all; their sense of smell had already been numbed by the stench.</p>
<p>Zabino got up from in front of the Buddha statue and took his sister Ani Luona to graze the livestock. When he opened the gate of the corral, the sheep bleated and ran out, following Ani Luona in flocks towards the pasture. Cattle and horses bounded and followed. The grasslands were filled with noise.</p>
<p>Old Woman Suoqi ran out of the Mongolian yurt, shouting wildly:</p>
<p>"Ani Luona! Wait! The cows haven't been milked yet! Ani Luona!"</p>
<p>But Ani Luona had already passed through the row of pagoda trees and was playing with the lambs in the pasture, singing the pastoral song of Goolie Bentu with great interest.</p>
<p>By the time breakfast was ready, Zabino had fed his beloved hunting horse and brushed off all the winter fur that hadn't fallen off yet. At this moment, the horse's whole body and hooves were the same color, and its short fur shone brightly. Especially its fat, sturdy buttocks, which made people know at a glance that it was a "vigorous" hunting horse. Who wouldn't love it?</p>
<p>Old Woman Suoqi ate and grumbled, complaining that her son Tobino shouldn't have sold that yellow horse cheaply:</p>
<p>"You spendthrift! Such a good animal sold for so little money!"</p>
<p>She was used to nagging. No matter what the matter was, good or bad, she had to nag. Her children knew her temper well, so they always ignored her, as if her words hadn't entered their ears.</p>
<p>The sun hung high in the sky, and the distant mountains and grasslands showed clear colors. Sunlight accompanied by a gentle breeze, gently kissing the grasslands, kissing the forests, kissing the herds, and even Jian Duo Nen River comfortably embraced the sunlight. Magpies, chirping incessantly, flew back and forth between the trees, seeming happy and worried. Zabino rode his horse along the bank of the Kun Duo Nen River. He whistled, watching the water in the river, and the horse's hooves occasionally hit flint stones, causing bright sparks to flash.</p>
<p>After crossing the thin reeds, not far from the grassland was the beach. He jumped off his horse, shouldered his shotgun, and drilled and shouted wildly in the reeds. Before he had finished smoking a cigarette, a yellow sheep (note) jumped out, running towards the beach on three legs. Tobino aimed at it. With a bang, the yellow sheep fell to the ground. He was initially surprised how the yellow sheep could be hiding in the reeds. When he saw that the yellow sheep had injured its hind leg, he realized that it had been chased into the reeds by a hunter.</p>
<p>Along the riverbank, the horse galloped, with the reins loose. Grasshoppers flew back and forth on the tips of the grass, constantly tapping their wings. The glittering river flowed gurgling. The green leaves of the pagoda trees shone brightly, constantly trembling. The horse slowed down, panting. Tobino saw that he was almost at the Kado Mountains, so he let the horse rest for a while.</p>
<p>A breeze carried the sound of a horse neighing. When Tobino looked in the direction of the sound, he saw a group of people coming down from the Kado Mountains. From a distance, there were about ten people. He suspected they were bandits? Suddenly, he remembered that today was the birthday of Keshing Sabel, and these were people from other places coming to offer congratulations. Reassured, he got on his horse and walked again. Before long, he encountered that group of people head-on - ah! They were outsiders!</p>
<p>The riders all carried weapons, and their figures were not tall. He couldn't help but feel a little timid.</p>
<p>"Halt! Where are you going?" A little guy with a mustache shouted at Tobino, and pulled him off his horse.</p>
<p>"Going to the Kado Mountains to hunt!" Although Tobino was scared, he tried to gather his courage. The Khalkha people are never cowardly!</p>
<p>"Do you know that there are troops on the eastern slope of the Kado Mountains?" One could tell from his accent that this was a Kalmyk.</p>
<p>The Kalmyk Mongol helped those dwarves search Tobino, but they didn't find anything.</p>
<p>"He must be a spy! Take him away!" Two dwarves started to bind Tobino. Tobino turned his arm, and the two people immediately fell to the ground. He quickly jumped on his horse and hit the horse hard to run. He galloped as if flying. The people behind him also chased him. Gunshots constantly chased after him. His heart was pounding with the horse's hooves. Seeing that he was about to be caught up, he turned back and fired, and the horse-riding leader fell off his horse. When he went to fire the second shot, he had already been shot in the left arm by a bullet flying from behind. He endured the pain and ran.</p>
<p>As he ran, the horse was stopped by a ditch. With a whoosh, the horse was shot down by a bullet. He aimed at the pursuers and shot another one dead. Before he could fire the second shot, the enemy's rain of bullets swallowed him. The Kun Duo Nen River flowed quietly. Tobino's blood stained the grass. The dwarves' men and horses galloped towards the Perun Kenjue Plain.</p>
<h3>The Knife-Stealing Child</h3>
<p>— Lyon</p>
<p>The morning sunlight brightened the flat edge of the street, leaving the other half still in shadow.</p>
<p>In that shadowy half, four human legs were racing, like deer chasing in the deep mountains. The front two legs belonged to a boy of eleven or twelve years old, barefoot, with dirty calico shorts hanging around his knees. He didn't care about the broken glass and rusty nails on the ground, running forward desperately. He seemed to sense something like a tiger or wolf chasing after him. However, the two legs behind belonged to a young vendor, who was desperately chasing, the distance between them at most only a yard or two, but he just couldn't catch up.</p>
<p>He shouted, "Catch the little thief, catch the little thief... you son of a bitch, daring to steal my livelihood..." He cursed again, his anger causing the veins at his temples to bulge, wishing he had a pistol...</p>
<p>Passersby walking on the sunny side of the street were attracted by the shouts and went to the shadowy side to see what was happening.</p>
<p>The child running in front, called a little thief, was also anxious and flustered. He seemed to discover that all around him were countless things like tigers and wolves lunging at him. At this moment, he wanted a ladder to heaven, wanted two wings. He regretted not having four legs. He wanted to abandon the thing in his sleeve, but he couldn't bear to part with it. "Hasn't my stomach endured three meals? The flavor of that yellow croaker head, the sesame fragrance of that sesame cake. If he doesn't have anything to take to 'Old Man Crook's' stall to exchange for some money to fill his stomach, he won't be able to make it through today. Don't these people know the pain of hunger? They all want to help that vendor! The vegetable seller is rushing to catch me. This poor wretch, they won't even let me go… poor wretch…" A wave of bitterness washed over him. His hand loosened, and the thing in his sleeve fell to the ground with a "clang," it was precisely that fruit knife. "Wasted a whole morning's effort, and still have to go hungry, go hungry…" He was extremely heartbroken.</p>
<p>His legs also felt weak, wanting to stop and catch his breath, he was truly exhausted from running.</p>
<p>Just three steps away, the young vendor picked up the knife, still not willing to let go. The child's short shirt collar was grabbed. He cried loudly, stubbornly protesting his innocence. He was afraid that the fruit knife would stab into his flesh, or cut off his ears, his nose, and the two hands that steal things. He wanted to use his crying to solicit people's forgiveness and sympathy, and also wanted to stubbornly resist. Apart from that, he couldn't think of any way to cope with the emergency.</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, you stole my livelihood and you're still resisting, you little dog x of a…" The young vendor raised his fist and beat the child's waist wildly, cursing as he beat. The onlookers made their comments:</p>
<p>"At such a young age and already stealing, people are getting worse and worse!"</p>
<p>"This little rascal has probably stolen more than once. You have to give him a harsh lesson so he won't dare again."</p>
<p>The young vendor seemed to be getting more and more energetic as he beat him. "Little thief, you stole my knife, I want your life!" Fists rained down on him. He just "wailed, wailed, wailed…" His tearful eyes swept across the faces of every onlooker, wanting to find someone in the middle to save him, willing to kneel down and kowtow a hundred times to beg for mercy. He had never been beaten so badly before. Blood flowed from his nostrils, dripping on his short shirt, on the ground…</p>
<p>Finally, a shop assistant from a clothing store came out to mediate, and the young vendor finally let go and left.</p>
<p>The child wiped his eyes and nose with his hand. Blood and tears mixed together, flowing to his mouth, flowing into his mouth along his gray-white lips. He could discern the taste, bitter and sour. He limped away along the shadowy side of the street…</p>

<h3>Expulsion from the Clan</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>Today, the ancient Fang Family Ancestral Hall in Shuangjingtou, Fangjiawan, suddenly opened its two doors that had been tightly closed year-round. The sandy open space in front of the door also seemed to be much cleaner than usual, as if someone had tidied it up.</p>
<p>Inside the ancestral hall, in the east wing's conference room, tables and benches were arranged in an orderly manner, as if a meeting was about to begin. The villagers who went to town, passing by here, all invariably glanced at the huge gate with the two door gods painted on it with a surprised look, some even curiously stepping onto the high stone steps, sticking their heads in to look around:</p>
<p>"What is the Fang family opening the ancestral hall for?" Everyone had this question.</p>
<p>Beside the pond behind the ancestral hall, several women were squatting, washing things. The "thump-thump-thump" of pounding clothes echoed around, and circles of ripples floated on the water, slowly spreading out, layer upon layer, disappearing into the wild rice stalks by the pond, shaking several wild rice stalks that kept bowing their heads.</p>
<p>"I've said long ago that Mistress Shengbao can't be trusted for not marrying at such a young age," Auntie Axing said, stopping her hand from rubbing rice in the rice basket.</p>
<h3>Bull Nose – Soulmate</h3>
<p>— Huang Yao</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? If she had been sensible and kept her eyes open, she wouldn't have had to make such an ugly scene of being expelled from the Fang family!" Mrs. Caisheng also stopped the pestle in her hand that was pounding clothes, tilting her head and speaking somewhat indignantly.</p>
<p>"It's all that evil spirit Gengfu, he already has a wife at home, but still goes out to look for wild food…" Auntie San hadn't finished her sentence when that sharp-tongued girl Xingbao interrupted:</p>
<p>"Last night, she was caught by her uncle somehow. It's said that when Agen quietly climbed from the loft into her room, Gengfu and she were…" She suddenly stopped there, and two red clouds flew onto her cheeks? So she lowered her head.</p>
<p>"Hehe! Doing what? Xingbao, why don't you finish saying it? You little dead x!" Xingbao embarrassedly pinched Xiaojin's face and ran away.</p>
<p>"I heard that they're still going to open the ancestral hall today!" Auntie Er seemed to be quite worried for her.</p>
<p>"Of course. How could she still be able to stand in the Fang family gate? Originally, Agen the leper had already been coveting her property. Now that she's done this wrong thing herself, it's perfectly justifiable to expel her from the clan!" Auntie Axing glanced at her thin mouth, as if she could see through all the secrets.</p>

<p>Liya: Bah! Are you crazy? Why did you laugh for so long; and then suddenly say such a strange thing? What do you mean I've been in China for a few weeks? Huh?! Strange!</p>

<p>Zixia asked about filial piety. The Master said: "The difficulty lies in the countenance. When there is work, the young people undertake the toil; when there is wine and food, the elders are served. Is this to be considered filial piety?"</p>
<p>The Master said: "I have talked with Hui for a whole day, and he has not contradicted me, as if he were stupid. But when he retires and I examine his private conduct, I find that he is able to develop my teachings. Hui is not stupid."</p>
<p>The Master said: "Observe what a man does, note his motives, and examine in what things he rests. How can a man conceal his character? How can a man conceal his character?"</p>
<p>The Master said: "By reviewing what he has learned and learning anew, he may be a teacher."</p>
<p>The Master said: "The superior man is not a utensil."</p>

<p>The Master said: "The superior man is broad and not partisan. The mean man is partisan and not broad."</p>
<p>The Master said: "To learn without thinking is labor lost; to think without learning is perilous."</p>
<p>The Master said: "To attack strange doctrines is indeed harmful!"</p>

<p>Autumn shadows sadly close the vermilion gate. Elegant and charming, Tan Chun is calculating. She is the one who, seeing the begonias, thinks of forming a society. Personally choosing an auspicious day from the almanac. The sisters in the whole garden are surprised. Lady Busy is overjoyed to hear of it. In a moment, she drafts the rules of the poetry society. She also calls the maids of her neighborhood. In a flash, skirts are spread out, gathered in the Yi Hong Courtyard. In a short time, wonderful words are like pearls, arguments abound. For a long time, the individual seals are inscribed in dispute. Let us put aside other matters and become poets. Autumn begonias value the white flowers. Let us use this as the name of the society. The rules of the society are set, the group is seated. Everyone searches and ponders deeply. The poems of Hengwu Jun are praised by the crowd. The secluded and sorrowful works surpass those of Shanghai and Hunan. Only Yi Hong willingly takes last place. She is the one who does not intend to compete with the daughters. The begonias smile and bloom more beautifully. Standing tall and upright, planted in jade pots. From then on, the courtyard gate is lonely and the soul is dispirited.</p>

<h3>"Shanghai" and "Paris"</h3>
<p>In a certain forest, there is a child raised on mare's milk who does not understand human language. His father was killed by bandits, and he is determined to take revenge. He hides in the jungle, his sole purpose being to find the murderer. A divine horse as brave as a dragon and tiger, because it is loyal to its young master, disregards high mountains and steep ridges, and deals with the bandit party. And a beautiful girl is a friend in need. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, they finally capture the bandit chief and bring him to justice, each fulfilling their wishes. This is the plot of "Tarzan of the Divine Horse" opening at the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Rock's "Cowardly Hero" will be shown at the Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre starting today.</p>
<h3>Carlton's New Plan</h3>
<p>The palace drama "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness" premieres tonight</p>
<p>British films have made great strides in recent years, which is an undeniable fact. Since 1930, the British have invested 5 million pounds in the film industry, with over 50 sound photography studios. The quality of their works is also on the rise, chasing after American films. Recently, British film companies, seeing that Shanghai's major first-run theaters have all been occupied by American films, have started anew, renting the Carlton Theater and repainting the interior of the theater. All the equipment has also been improved, and it is scheduled to open tonight (Friday) night. The first film is the French historical palace romance "Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness" I Give My Heart; this is a great production of the British United Film Company, starring the famous European singer Gitta Alpar, with beautiful music and grand scenes, similar to Dolores del Río's "The Gay Cavalier". Following this film, there are also George Arliss's new great construction "The Guv'nor", Lily Harvey's dance and song new film Invitation To The Waltz, and Old Curisity Shop, adapted from the literary masterpiece of the famous British novelist Dickens.</p>
<h3>The Life Story of Bai Yushuang</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>Who doesn't know that Bai Yushuang is very popular in Shanghai! Things like "Widow Ma's Shop" and "Pan Jinlian" are really popular and pleasing to everyone. Especially Bai Yushuang's performance of flirtatious female roles is most touching. Anyone who has seen Peng Peng Opera probably believes that my words are not exaggerated.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Bai Yushuang's life story, it is truly very tragic. Before "May Fourth," she was still performing on stage in Tianjin. At that time, she was already quite popular! Unfortunately, her husband was a prodigal son, an idler who loved to gamble, losing everything. He loved to drink, getting drunk every time. When his pocket was empty, he would reach out to Bai Yushuang for money, so almost seven or eight tenths of Bai Yushuang's income was spent by this hopeless husband. And the remaining two or three tenths had to support her father-in-law, an old man who was worried sick because his son was hopeless, and two children. In short, Bai Yushuang was responsible for the livelihoods of several family members.</p>
<p>At that time, it was a time of rampant warlords. Once, Bai Yushuang went to a certain general's mansion to perform a hall performance and was subjected to an insult. She tried every possible method to escape the cage. Unexpectedly, when she arrived at her door, her father-in-law had already died of anger, while her husband was living a life of extravagance and dissipation in a gambling den.</p>
<p>Later, Bai Yushuang stopped performing due to excessive stimulation. At this moment, her husband sold all her performing costumes. Soon, he also sold Bai Yushuang's son. Thus, in Bai Yushuang's life history, hundreds and thousands of scars were left on her forever.</p>
<p>The above is the life story of a tragic female protagonist played by Bai Yushuang in the film "Red Begonia". The female lead is not named Bai Yushuang, but "Red Begonia."</p>
<h3>Two Artists Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two movie artists left Shanghai on the Shanghai-Beiping train the day before yesterday. The one who left the day before yesterday was the eccentric Shen Xiling. After returning from Guangxi, he became a problematic person. The final conclusion was that he should return to Guangxi. But he is really an eccentric. He did not do what people guessed. The day before yesterday, he booked a second-class ticket to Beiping for 150 yuan through a certain travel agency to travel. This wish was made when he was still at Mingxing. At that time, he hoped that Mingxing would settle his salary arrears and he would immediately leave Mingxing for Beiping. Now this wish has finally been achieved. It is said that if he is in the mood, he would also like to stroll on the Great Wall. Yes, it is very beneficial for a film director to take a leisurely stroll in the courtyard like that. I believe that the content of his works will definitely be more substantial afterwards. Another one is Lan Ping, who has also become a problematic person recently. Recently, when she was considering joining which company, she suddenly received a letter from her family in Shandong, a letter from her mother, saying that she was seriously ill and asked Lan Ping to go back. In order to comfort her elderly mother, Lan Ping went to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Beiping train yesterday. She will probably be delayed in Shandong for two weeks. In that case, the Shanghai issue will naturally have to be resolved in two weeks.</p>
