<p>旅行遇信</p>
<h3>從上海飛西京　（上）</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>「飛飛飛，飛到東，飛到西……」當一個給某一乘客送行的小孩、唱着這諗熟的歌的時候，歐亞航空公司的「蓉克斯」機，眞的載着記者和其他三位乘客，飄飄然駕雲騰空而起，飛過龍華塔的上空去了。那時俯瞰下的塔，寺，民房、竹木等等，都漸漸地縮小了：縮小成好像可以玩于鼓掌之上的模型一樣。憑空遠望，一目千里，使我想起在大洋中乘着輪船的光景。惟海景是平淡單調的，而這劫變化奇突。這下面一片無涯的新耕麥地，阡陌縱橫，土色褐黃，像煞無數炕熟了的大餅和餅乾，一塊一塊的往後拋擲。間或點染上些灣曲蜿蜓的銀溪，一叢叢尙未落葉的綠樹，如火如荼的丹楓，不很顯示出高度和峯稜的山陵。錯綜的景物，多樣的色彩，接觸到我的眼簾，我是禁不住神住了。飛了一程，侍者端來一滿杯咖啡，和兩塊用紙盤盛着的點心，紙盤擱在膝上，端杯執匙而食，倒也處之泰然，安之若素—這當然有關於飛機飛行平穩，和內部設備完善的問題；我的略記些在下面罷。</p>
<p>我們所乘的飛機，有三螺旋機，（螺旋機在空中，每分鐘能轉一千八百决），載重二千啟羅（卽公斤），設客座八位，若客擠可增坐十六位，外加兩個駕駛員，與電務員及侍役，共計可載二十人，兩駕駛員平肩坐於機首，以司駕駛：電務員挨在中間，把前途各站用無綫電拍來的氣候報吿，隨時用紙條寫譯了通知他倆。客座設於腹部，恰像電影院的座椅，的有四五排（是活動的），每排可坐二人，分靠窗壁，中間留一過道。車窗上面，置有網兜，可以裝放輕便物。沿窗壁拖着一條粗絲帶，若遇氣候變化劇烈，飛機突然遇厚氣層而挺上一二丈，忽又逢薄氣層而落下二三丈，怕頭暈更可把那帶一把抓着。而且那帶中間，還通着一股有力的細風，如眞覺頭暈，還可以放開阻球，迎面吹些新鮮空氣。飛機飛在高度，如乘客患心臟病，戚覺呼吸困難時，可通知侍役，將氧氣筒旋開使用。由上海飛到南京，高度多在六百公尺與九百公尺之間。後過豫陝間的山地，也僅及一千三百公尺，本不算很高，但那天也有一客「呃」的一聲，把早上剛吃進的點心，一個「倒回龍」吐了出來，可是並不曾弄髒了天堂凈地，因爲座决已早備下嘔吐袋了。尾部還設有搪磁馬桶，以供大小便不時之需。</p>
<p>此種機式，原是德國新式軍用機，機身胸腹部向地的一面（向背那上半部卽載客），原是裝置炸彈的；改爲民用機，則作放行李及郵件之用。但遇非常之時，機尾添裝機槍，依然可以改爲軍用機。</p>
<p>剛飛了沒多少時侯，飛機掠過幾座小山，就發現了中山陵，和浸浴在朝烟裏的半個城圈，不用說這就到了首站的南京，看手錶係七點六十分，减去六點五十分的起飛時刻，僅歷時一點十分。但還不够快，若乘流綫型螺旋機的飛機，只消五十分鐘罷了。（未完）</p>

<h3>人民戰綫和社大黨</h3>
<p>— 雲南</p>
<p>自從西班牙內戰發生以來，月本政府又更進一步壓迫「人民戰綫運動』了。許多較前進的知識份子被逮捕，許多雜誌被停刋，以及軍部的禁止官立軍需工廠從業員加入工會的組織，這都是直接間接對人民戰綫運動的打擊。</p>
<p>在政府方面的代言人說來：人民占綫，是是防衛祖國的，是對抗法西斯蒂的勢力的，是以共產黨爲提倡的主體的。現在日本政府的「農村救濟政策」，「電力國營政策」……等，都具有國家社會主義的色彩，無「法西斯蒂一的傾向。同時日本自身，也並未受到外國的侵略。而且日本國內也沒有共產黨的組織（？）。因此，日本沒有結成人民戰綫的必要。若果要勉强結成，那反而促成日本全國人民的分裂和對立。（見野方頑談人民戰綫解剖時代十一月號。）但是事實呢？劫恰恰擊破這種粉飾的假面，日本人民戰錢運動，正在現實的基礎上活躍的展開着。</p>
<p>日本然沒有勢力很大的法西斯蒂政黨，但在各政黨中顯然就有着法西斯蒂的勢力。而　國民同盟」（日本政黨之一），更明白的是和德意同其方向。政黨以外的法西斯蒂團體，實數現已超出三百以外。日本的法西斯蒂勢力，本是與日本的滿洲活動同時抬頭的。抬頭的主要原因，是因爲國內經濟危機的加重。這也和意大利，德意志完全一樣。經濟危機加重，常常強化了支配階級間的對立和抗爭。由於道個對立，抗爭，法西斯蒂就應運而生了。在此時，法西斯蒂常被認爲支配階級的新的支柱，新的力。</p>
<p>日本自力一八以來，並未能解决一般的社會問題。對內：勞動者生活水準低下農民彷徨於飢餓錢上，軍費年年膨漲，失業者的數量激增，濫發公債，實行大衆增稅等，都足以使小資產階層的人們，急速的沒落。對外：和蘇聯的　係，日益緊張，「漁區問題」呵，「國境問題」呵，常常鬧個不休；和英美的關係，也因中國問題，利益衝突非常尖銳；而在中國內部，高漲着的抗日情緒，救國聯合運動等，都足令日本民衆，感到戰爭的威脅，感到是生活在戰爭的前夜。</p>
<p>這些對內對外的問題，很能帮助法西斯蒂勢力的發展。而政府的政策，與此相應，也顯著的表示出法西斯蒂的傾向。例如「電力國營案」呵，「行政改革案」呵，都是走向法西斯蒂的道路的。議會完全失了作用，代議士等於沒有，政黨呢，只有恊力促進法西斯蒂政策的樹立和執行，機能茍延。這已成爲日本當前的實際情況，也就是日本配階級難於掩蔽的事實，同時，也就是日本人民所以要努力結成人民戰綫的中要原因。</p>
<p>在一九三二年七月，日本「全國勞農大衆黨」和「社會民衆黨」，合併而組織「社會大衆黨」（以後　稱社大黨）。　就是基於大衆的要求，結合共同戰綫，而和法西斯蒂勢力對抗的表現。社大黨的結成，除上述兩黨外，支持他的，還有「工會會議」（在日本有組織的勞動者中，屬於工會會議者，號稱佔十分之七。）和「日本農民總同盟」（全國農會，大半加入，爲日本農民運動之主流）。特別値得注目的，是「借家人同盟」（由多數中小商工業者的團體和一般薪俸生活者組織而成），也成爲社大黨支持團體之一。</p>
<p>這現象是說明了甚麼呢？這就是說：日本人民戰綫的結成，本不自今日始，不過今日才有「人民戰綫」的名稱吧了。</p>
<p>社大黨雖然得到了上述許多團體的支持，但他本身還是不能健全的發展下去，這一方面固然是由於法西斯蒂勢力的壓迫，另一方面却也是由於社大黨幹部的本身，缺乏正確的認識。他們當中的一部份，甚至於說：『因爲勞動者和農民的目的，是要打倒資本主雜，所以應當先聯合法西斯蒂，打倒資本主義。」這樣的主張，是已成爲法西斯蒂的衛兵了。</p>
<p>日本民衆，爲了黨前的重要目的，在理論上雖也曾充分的批判了社大黨，但在戰略上，仍然是企圖　大以社大黨爲中心的聯合戰綫，這由今年五月的總選舉，無產黨所得到的空前的勝利，就可以看得出來。無產黨是想佔據一個政治的統一戰綫展開和法西斯蒂的鬥爭的。　　今年「二，二六」事件發生後，表面上看來，好像法西斯蒂的陣營，是已經動搖分裂了，其實法西斯蒂的勢力，是更伸張了一些。「二，二六」事件後，大衆所受的壓迫，，是比以前加甚了，囚此，大衆對於政治的統一戰綫的要求，也比以前更熾烈。從來對社大黨抱着批判態度的勞勤工會和「農民會」，也基於大衆的願望，進行結成以社　黨爲中心的統一戰綫了。</p>
<p>然而社大黨的本身，可沒有糾合黨外諸勢力，結成反法西斯蒂人民戰錢的决心。縱然「新勞農無產團體協議會」已經成立，　然他們在宣言上明白的寫着：『……以結成人民戰綫爲目標，結合在反法西戰綫上的——社會黨以外的諸勢力，然後加盟社大黨，而結成廣汛的鞏固的人民戰綫』。但社大黨幹部態度，始終都是表現極其排外的。</p>
<p>這有兩個主要的原因：</p>
<p>（一）大黨幹部有法西斯蒂的傾　。</p>
<p>（二）恐怕和高唱「人民戰綫一的新勢力合作，降低了得來社大黨指導部的威信。</p>
<p>這種認不情敵人，以政治爲兒戲的態度，在社上黨本身，自然將引起黨內勞動者的分化，這將是毫無問題的。而且進一步，恐怕還將引起大衆對黨的厭棄。因爲在重重高　舟之下，人民戰綫運動，已經不是思想問題而是政治運　了。它的力量旣已在大衆間高揚，社大黨有甚麼力量可以阻止它呢，</p>
<p>社大黨反對人民戰綫的理由是：『結成人民戰綫，反而刺激了對方，使政府得到彈壓勞動運動的口實』。然而，這種理由，得不到大衆的採納，反而引起了大衆的反感。於是形成了人民的戰綫運動，將脫離社大黨指導部的指導，而從社大黨以外的工人團體，農民團體，屬於社大系的勞動者和農民，以及一些沒有組織的大衆們，去自動的組織，自動的發展。</p>
<p>據日本政治經濟硏究所勞動調查部最近的報吿，八月二十七日，由於幾勞動團體的支持，在一統一促進委員會」的議席上，已經通過：「必須聯合一切無產勢力、以社大黨爲中心，才能實現反法西斯蒂的統一政治戰綫」。同時，「勞農協議會」也發表聲明，倘若社大黨接受各團體的提議，開放門戶，則「勞農協議會」，也將無條件的加入社大黨。社大黨對這個請求，九月二日，做了具體的回答，提出了三個條件：</p>
<p>（一）各團體均須單獨聲明支持社大黨。</p>
<p>（二）各團體均須參加「工會會議」。</p>
<p>（三）入黨時必須以個人資格，加入所屬支部。</p>
<p>但對於勞農恊議會呢？社大黨却巧妙的拒絕了。理由是：爲了政黨的組織關係，必須個別考慮。可是，九月四”，「勞農恊議會又提出了無條件參加的請求。這到現在還沒有具體的結果。總之，不論社大黨幹部的意向如何，從下面爆發出來的力量，總是可以促進日本人民戰綫的發展的。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>論援綏運動</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這幾天中。我們的素負盛名的傅作義將軍。督同着部下勇敢善戰的將士。為了祖國。正在天寒地凍的寨外。跟那受着某方指揮的所謂偽匪軍作殊死戰。這一種壯烈的苦戰。在我國的歷史運命上是有着莫大的意義的。據前方情報。偽匪軍帶着飛機坦克重砲等現代軍事利器。從十四日晚間起。向紅格爾圖我軍陣地猛烈進攻了多次。某國標記的飛機投下的炸彈多至百餘枚。可是因為我軍士氣旺盛的綠故。每决進攻都被擊退了。現在敵人正向多倫熱河續調着偽軍增援。準備繼續猛攻。聽說敵人的預定計劃。打算突破興和陶林的我軍防綫。進犯卓資山平地泉。截斷平綏路。同時派騎隊人大淸山。越險進襲五原河套等地。就這些情報看來。更慘烈的戰爭不久就要到來是想像得到的。我們知道。偽匪軍本身大半是臨時編成的烏合之衆。戰鬥能力並不强。但是其背後的國際勢力。郤已在飛機坦克等進攻武器上明明白白地表現出來了。因此我們决不把這戰爭當作普通的剿匪戰爭來看待。我們堅决地認定着。這是我國生死關頭的戰爭。需要着全國上下用全力來應。</p>
<p>這一個認識在我國民衆方面已經漸漸普及起來了。連日各界人士對於綏軍慰勞金的踴躍輸將。有許多景象。是可歌可泣的。平滬各校的停煤减食表示着靑年的高漲情緒。閻錫山氏的遺產救國。表示着有產者的犧牲精神。而上海三十餘團體的函請成立綏遠軍後援會尤其足以表現民衆的普遍的意志。我們希望這一種運動在全國到處儘量地發展起來。務使人人明了自身的運命跟前錢將士有着密切的聯繋。情願節衣縮食來盡自己對於祖國的一份責任。因為這一點一滴的力量如果充分地集合起來。是一定可以挽救現在綏遠的。也就是全中國的危機的。</p>
<p>至於政府方面。對於綏遠將士的援助和接濟當然是已有確常計畫的了。可是我們鑒於局勢的嚴重。却還禁不住要向政府表示一些我們的希望。我們覺得偽匪軍旣有强大的背景。可以得到無限制的接濟。我們在軍事上是决不能以局部的防守為限的。我們必須作多方面的統盤的策畫才是。否則「星星之火可以燎原。」西班牙的叛軍。因為有國際背景的綠故。已經打到該國的首都了。這可不是我們的殷鑒麽。</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>一代綱球巨型　鐵爾登煑酒諭英雄　極力推崇德國克拉姆　九日抵港表演次日十日赴菲</h3>
<p>香港特訊終身盡瘁於網球事業之織爾登、與高據職　網球皇座之梵恩斯、此次應日本讀賣新聞社之敦聘、赴日本表演生平絕技、先後在日本比賽七次、因二氏技術之超　、備受歡迎、表演後、卽乘林肯總統輪抵吾國上海、六日在滬舉行單雙打表演、因時間關係、七日卽乘原輪南下、九晨十時已抵香港、港網球聯會派出代表多人前往輪埠歡迎、二氏及梵夫人旋卽下榻於香港大酒店、女職　網球家夏伯小姐、因病未有同來、鐵梵兩氏休息後、卽於下午四時在香港木球會草地塲舉行首决單打表演、採三盤兩勝制度、給果梵恩斯以十四比十二·六比三、直下兩盤得勝、下午六時三十分、鐵爾登復在大酒店天臺作公關演講、八時三十分、應草地網球聯會之歡宴、並演講網球方法、（李惠堂曾記錄其演講登載十四日本報）十日下午三時半、再在木球總會作二次單打表演、取五盤一勝制、門票分三元五角及二元五角兩種、觀衆千餘人、熱鬧情形、允勝於昨、香港各界要人、均蒞塲參觀、比賽結果、十比八·六比四·三比六·六比三梵恩斯以三比一勝、當晚六時、鐵氏卽偕梵恩斯夫婦乘原船赴馬尼拉表演、預定歸途中再在香港勾留兩日、將繼續表演、然後取道上海歸國、此次過港時、鐵氏曾發表談話、暢論現下世界網球情勢、誌之如下、</p>
<p>東遊觀眾　打破空前紀綠</p>
<p>記者於鐵氏抵港時、在輪中與之晤、據鐵爾登氏對記者發表談話稱，明年度之台維期杯賽、英國因少去　萊效力、德國或美國均有奪標希望、德國第一名手克拉姆、大有奪取惠勃爾登冠軍之勢、名列世界第一名之網球家名手潘莢、已轉職業球員、深信且已簽訂合的、惟不知合的之內容爲何如耳、關于本人等此次東遊、當抵日本表演時、所到之處、觀衆之多、達四萬人、打破空前紀錄、單在上海表演、觀衆亦達三千人以上、</p>
<p>法柯顯脫　最近常有佳作</p>
<p>本從與梵恩斯夫婦作遠東之遊、此爲第一次、沿途觀感甚佳、預定到崛尼拉表演、塲之門券、聞現　售聲、外傳本人等將到南菲一遊、實屬不確、蓋吾人在美訂有合約、必須定期回國踐的也、美國台杯代表如雙打健將史社芬及洛脫等、自轉入職業球員後、轉戰全美成績甚佳、卽最近本人偕史氏遊英、亦獲職業雙打冠軍、其最引人注目之法名將柯顯脫、最近常有佳作、明年五月之雲布利賽、彼將成爲各名將之勁敵、</p>
<p>澳洲名手仍在萌芽期中</p>
<p>關於各國名將、本人在全美　標賽時、曾見美國名手勃洽表演、頗見能幹、　恐非德人克拉姆敵手、照本人觀察、本年惠勃爾登賽、克拉姆倘非足部　筋、或可擊敗潘萊、關於明年台杯賽、澳洲僅能戰至北美洲帶决賽，蓋美國勃治隨便可能戰勝澳洲第一二名手、雖奎士脫爲其中名手、極其量亦不足與各將爭雄、而澳洲名手仍在萌芽時期也、</p>
<p>德國材盛　打得一手好球</p>
<p>克勞馥已成人老珠黃、獨麥格拉斯頗爲能幹、打得　手好球、觀其與美作台杯賽時可知、德國勢大雄厚、雖然僅靠克拉姆及軒渠人、倘二人絕無意多、當可爲德國榮膚冠軍、澳洲斷不能與爭衡也、本人極力推崇格蘭、向有大志、惜不能成　網球好手、在台維杯賽時、未見佳作、美國靑年韓狄士未可許爲台杯代表、惟能繼續參加種種球賽、則是其長處、</p>
<p>馬勃女士　媲美馬迪夫人</p>
<p>在女子中、馬　爾雖未嘗得稱全美冠軍、惟彼畏期練習下來、直至現在、儼然已有馬迪夫人之豐度、關於集合職業球員而成職業競技塲一事、可决絕無其事、世人以訛傳訛、已成流語、現藉此機會特爲辯正、蓋各員均有各人之合的、並不隸屬於任何集團、空穴來風、憑何根據、至此、允有鄭重聲明、本人與柯布速並無係、此行東方純由本人及梵氏與各地計劃而已、</p>
<p>職業球員　業餘斷難勝之</p>
<p>凡一職業球員每决出賽、必須顯出平生絕技、以饜觀衆、其不幸者一般摔角及拳術之荒謬論調、對職業網球常加以不良印象、此爲荒謬絕倫之論、尤有進者、凡好手表演斷不能於一塲或塲塲可能顯盡本色、此可於世界第一流名手見之單就潘萊而言、除重要比賽外、曾幾見顯盡本能哉、本人未　職業球昌亦如是也、至於以職業第一流名手、而與業餘第一流者比蛟、照本人觀察、德之納斯連及美之梵恩斯、每人均可能解决潘萊云、</p>

<h3>美記者由日抵滬談　日德同盟成熟　日方即提樞密院審議　並希望能有他國參加　—德總領克禮具昨仍否認—</h3>
<p>盛傳已久之日德同盟說、本月初德國駐華大使陶德曼氏、假滿過日來華返任、道出滬上時、尙向記者否認、乃昨日英文大美晚報載、美國巴爾蒂摩亞太陽報編輯柏特森氏Paul　Patterson於前日下午、由日乘輪抵滬時、曾向報界宣稱、日本已於兩星期前、與德國商妥同盟云云、言之鑿鑿、似確有其事、</p>
<p>德總領猶表示否認　新聲社記者、爲此特於昨晚、趨訪德國駐滬總領事克禮貝氏、雖値深晚、克氏仍予延見、對於是說、猶表示否認、首謂、余不能曰然或不然、余從未接獲關於此事之情報、換言之、如有此事、余當可獲得本國政府之情報、現旣全無消息、故余殊不信、繼稱、猶憶日本報章、曾載中國與蘇聯同盟之說、貴國政府已予否認、德日同盟之說、殆出一轍、德國固亦曾予吾認矣云云、</p>
<p>日使館人員亦瑋言　新聲社記者再以電話詢諸日使館情報部發言人八谷實、八谷亦諱言此說、謂余且從未之聞、君此刻吿余、余方知之、余敢謂此說絕對不確、不然、我人不致毫無所聞也云、</p>
<p>巴氏所談同盟內容　大美晚報云、美國巴爾蒂摩太陽報記者柏特森氏、星期一（十六）日午後、由日乘格尼資勞號郵船抵滬、據稱、日德兩國已於兩星期前商妥同盟、當局曾警吿外人、不得傳出此項消息、並禁北日本各報登載此事、台東日日新聞（譯音）因追隨其他各報之猜測、載有日德意三國間對付蘇俄之某種協定、行將成熟、而將提交樞密院消息、致爲當局禁止出版、美人所辦之日本廣吿報因轉載台東日日新聞所載消息之大要、亦爲日當局勒令停刋一日、紐的通報訪員曾圖發出此項消息、而爲檢査員扣留、該的內容、現守秘密、但料十二月二十四日國會召集以前、必可由締的國接受其全文、此項同盟、確以對付蘇俄爲目的、按上星期日當局曾發表簡短之公報、謂有至關重要之外交事件、不日將提交閣議、同時駐日德大使德克森氏適由柏林返抵東京、德氏到後、日本政界異常活動、該大使先於星期三日下午謁見首相廣田、次日與外相有田、在其官邸、會談四十分鐘之久、繼又訪問外决掘內於是各報紛起猜測、東京朝日新聞、謂假如大使返任、而至外務省作禮式上之訪問、决不致如是之匆遽、是必有其他事故在焉、該報又稱、該大使曾與日外相正式討論日德之關係、東京報知新聞謂、德大使此次訪問外相、乃遵其携來本國政府之新訓令、而作重要談話云、京都新聞與日日新聞、亦作同樣之評論、並謂、德大使與廣田、討論約一小時之久、其討論之事件、爲德國在歐洲與遠東之政策、皆注重德日兩國宜立於共同陣綫、以抵抗蘇維埃卞義云、此項猜測、當局初未予以注意、直至台東日日新聞據實披露、使局勢轉爲緊張後、始加禁阻柏林與東京兩方近雖皆作否認、但德日兩國、行將團結以制共產主義之膨脹　傳播、則已不成問題矣、兩國之盟的、將於二三星期內、由首相廣田外相有田、提交樞密院會議、其確實條欵與訂的之雙方、擬以何種狀態成熟之、目前尙未明瞭、惟據消息靈通之日人聲稱、該的將「任令開放」、俾他國亦有加入之機會云、至於何國將與德日兩國携手、今仍未可遽定、衆意以爲必係意國、蓋德意兩國、近曾作談話，大有組織共同陣綫以抗共產主義之趨勢也、但日人對於意國之加入、殊爲懷疑、又按秩父親王明年赴英、參與英皇愛德華八世加冕典禮時、途中將於柏林小駐、晋謁希特勒、陳明德日兩國成立新關係之重要、此事早已傳播於外矣、今日人之與現政府無關者、對於日德同盟、皆異常注意、蓋不知英法美等國將有何反響、而中國後此所取之步驟、允爲彼等所注重、按駐華德大使陶德曼、近甫由柏林返任、雖陶使此行、是否與日德同盟有關、而駐華蘇俄大使鮑格莫洛夫刻正在返莫斯科途中、然此二事皆爲人所注目者也云云、按柏氏此次、乃偕其公子由日同來、明晨將共乘原船、赴新加坡然後將赴歐勾留若干時、</p>

<h3>本年七八兩月份　上海工商業異動概况（續）　（上海工商業概况之卅八）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>三·大新酒樓中西菜部開幕—該樓設大新公司五樓，係大新舞廳向大新公司承辦，再由該廳將中菜部出租與王為標君，由王君自任中菜部總理，並聘蘇章鈺君為經理，所有該部全都生財設備，均係大新舞廳所有，業於二十八日與西菜部同時開幕。</p>
<p>八月份中製造工業項下之重要異動，可列舉四家如下：</p>
<p>一·同豐印染公司開幕一該公司係由景豐印染廠及鴻豐印染公司改組而成，蓋自景豐印染廠因營業虧蝕，宜吿停業後，卽由韓崇欽君等集資糾設鴻豐印染公司並向景豐債權人租用該廠全部機器，嗣以條件不妥，遭該廠股東及一部份債權人反對，結果未成。延至本月，韓君等經雙方商妥，訂立租契，將鴻豐原名改為同豐，資本實收六萬元，為股份有限公司組織，推股東韓長生君為董事長，韓崇欽君為經理，專事目購坯布，印染出售二·元元與記牛奶公司開幕—該公司係由前元元農塲轉變而來，蓋該塲自因營業不振，無力償債，被金城銀行呈請查封，而於去年十月不得已實行淸算以來，其所有各項財產，經法院公吿拍賣，乃由郝多時君向法院承買，啟封營業，改名元元興記牛奶公司，該公司係股份有限公司組織，騁曹本濤君主持一切。該公司規模頗大，設佛完善，全部資產共值五六十萬元云。</p>

<h3>美滙仍難振作　先令未有變化</h3>
<p>滙市昨以僅兌仍升、美金仍鬆、先令則尙平、晨初以海外電吿、倫敦大條、近還俱　二五、脚地謂收市後、印度買進、賣方保留、市價在二十一便士一二九、（較收市高〇六二五）、交易不多等說、紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價　半分至七厘半不等、倫敦生金跌一便士、英對美升一二五、英對法勿動、美對英長〇六二五、美對法畏二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位跌二厘、滙市晨開近期賣價英滙一先令二便士五六二五、美滙二十九元六二五强、較之前收、計英平而美較硬、此乃滙兌仍升之故、開後華商續來脫售美金、惟以銀行維持、滙豐銀行掛牌、英美俱平而尚定、入後白銀平衡稅揭曉跌一分牛、日行有所塞出而形不振、上海亦拋、惟日商洋行界則結、午刻尙平、後市銀行求供不一、惟軋過則供方較股、但亦無礙大局、收盤近賣期價英滙一先令二便士五六二五、美滙二十九元六二五及六八七五對搭、較之前收、計英平而美鬆〇三一二五、遠期亦然、日商洋行稍結、華商約塞美金十餘萬元、今將成交錄後、</p>

<h3>證券　公債何至爭先賣出</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市況跌風未戢、各大戶之多頭出籠、仍有爭先恐後之象、綏遠戰事、從其背景推測、或有擴大之可能、債市趨跌、大都為多方出籠所致、現貨之流出、亦復不少、市價尚在高度、繼有回風、以吃戶之稀少、恐亦不易站定、昨日經過、上午開盤、各帮紛紛賣出、二十二號多頭出籠、首先傾吐、三十二及三十五號賣出亦多、檯面賣氣極濃、買戶寥若辰星、祗二十六號及五十八號稍有需要、市價則一致傾跌、小三角至七角、次盤三十五號賣出尤湧、十一及三十三號等亦有瀉出、市價續小五分一角至三角半、午後開盤、賣戶較稀、祇二十及三十二號等拋售較多、趨勢稍轉、前列續小一二角、後列已稍稍轉堅、檯面多頭心思、尚有餘戀、收盤臨時空頭抵補、十四及五十四號買進不少、一致回上五分一角三角不等、市價結果、一致續跌、甲種小二三角為最少、戊種小七角為最多、成交總數、共計九百五十四萬一千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　浮多稍有了結　紗市反動　本月大戶仍在拖進</h3>
<p>連漲一日之紗市、昨則又現反動回跌之象、蓋以價格過昂、客方紗銷呆頓、兼之綏遠戰事劇烈、人心受其打擊、浮多稍有了結、市盤乃復回挫、但大戶依然拖進、大阪三品紗漲風復熾矣、</p>
<p>標紗轉入疲途</p>
<p>標紗　市開盤、趨勢平疲因綏遠戰事劇烈、大阪三品紗回落、二盤以後浮多費出、市價步步下挫、但多方仍來特緊不放、吸收之額殊巨、惟現紗銷路頗滯、人心軟弱、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價跌一元三角至一元九角、午後關盤、以大阪三品紗仍上漲、人氣堅挺、回漲數角、旋以出現紗交易不暢、金城紗跌價、市況復入疲途、結果本月比上日收盤價漲一元一角、遠漲三·四角、查賣出賡豐展賣午買、協成一千三百包、大昌成一千二百包、大豐九百包、裕康八百包、合興三千五百五十包、賡豐二千九百包、昶記一千二百包、恒德一千零五十包、大昶三千五百五十包、豐泰一千二百包、買進恒益二千四百包、裕大一千四百包、錦昌二千五百五十包、明德一千七百包、仁豐九百五十包、泰昌一千四百包、益昶三千七百五十包、長豐七千四百包、豐泰興一千一百包、永大九百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>棉花略轉軟勢</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、但海外美棉回漲、而未屆棉產估計雖減二百萬担、然在一千四百萬担外、故人心尚平庸、但現棉廠需益覺發展、中外各廠購辦尚勤云、</p>
<p>標棉步降三四角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月參差不一、升降五分至一角半、繼以本屆棉產估計發表減縮二百萬担、仍在一千四百萬擔以外、人心平庸、賣氣稍熾、同時紗市不振、結果各月比上日收盤價跌二角半至三四角、午後開盤平平、市塲議論、謂俄國生產棉花、報載占世界第三位、多數看小、此種數量深恐有誤、據云係籽花數量、惟世界棉產雖同慶豐收、而美棉掉期依然堅昂、收盤仍屬平常、結果各月與上日相仿、查賣出合興五千八百担、信誠二千八百担、瑞大二千六百担、梅記三千八百担、永裕二千三百担、長餘八千担、豐泰三千一百担、仁豐四千四百擔、大昌成一千五百擔協成一千九百擔、買進賡豐七千被、錦昌二千九百擔、源大一千八百擔泰昌四千八百擔、協成五千九百擔、新昶四千擔、源興昌三千擔、通記三千二百擔、聚興三千二百擔、長和二千擔、明德一千四百擔、一日間最高低價列後、</p>

<h3>全國棉產二次估計概况　棉田增加棉產減少　但較去年增六百萬</h3>
<p>中華棉業統計會於二十五十一月十六日下五時公布二十五年全國棉產第二次估計如下</p>
<p>棉田面積　三四五、八六二、四二二『公畝』</p>
<p>合　五一、八七九、〇〇〇『市畝』</p>
<p>合　五六、二九二、七一一『舊制畝』</p>
<p>皮棉產額　八、四六八、六四四『公拍』</p>
<p>合　一六、九三七·〇〇〇『市担』</p>
<p>合　一四、四二九、二九一『舊制担』</p>
<p>廢田面積　五四三、一三〇『公畝』</p>
<p>合　八一、〇〇『市畝』</p>
<p>合　八八、四〇〇『舊制畝』</p>
<p>此項佔計（一）係根據河北、山東、山西、河南、陝西湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江蘇浙江、四川、等十二省及上海天津兩市之報吿編製而成、（二）以十一月十日以前之棉作狀況為準、（三）在十一月十、日以前各省棉作所受災害之損失、均巳計算在內、（四）棉田『舊制畝』每畝為部尺六十方丈、棉產『舊制担』每担為天平一百斤、</p>
<p>茲將本會歷年棉田產額佔計數比較於下（表中及文中未註明『公畝』『市畝』『公担』『市担』者、皆為『舊制畝』及『舊制担』</p>
<p>全國棉產狀況、本年大致良好、自下種初期以至本會第一次估計時、無論長江棉區或黃河棉區、氣候均極順適、因此一方面棉田大增、一方面收成良好、故第一次估計全國產額達一千六百三十七萬九千餘担、平均每畝收量幾及卅斤、實為近年所罕有之豐稔、第一次估計後、最初仍屬良好、黃河流域因　間雨水順適、棉株發育自佳、長江方面、僅江蘇鹽墾區域雨水為災、大部份則以秋季例有之風雨不作、而睛暖尤有助於晚花晚蒴之生長、棉收猶有繼續進步之可能、詎此種晴暖氣候、繼續延長、幾及兩月、迄未得雨、棉作初則苦乾終且吿災矣、全國棉區幾盡如此、江浙之風潮甚少、固大有益於　收、但亢旱之損失、殆亦非淺、惟浙江因會獲雨、仍有進步、其　多吿減收、因旱災輕重之不同、減率之大小略異、　川一省、水早相繼　災、受損尤重、估計全國棉田為九千六百二十九萬二千七百十二畝、較第一次增加一百二十五萬一千六百四十六畝、產額一千四百四十三萬九千二百九十一担、較第一次估計減少一百九十三萬九千九百零三担、但較二十四年仍增六百二十九萬六千三百八十担、平均每畝收量約二十六斤、較第一次估計減三斤餘、較上年實收則增二斤强、仍為最近五年之最高收成也、</p>
<h3>美棉形勢堅昂</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌三磅音至漲一磅音、塲中交易、大關為多頭了結及套賣、及十二月期掉往遠期、業外交易不多、雙方勢均力敵、現棉脚地堅定、布市較呆、美棉情勢堅昂、惟世界產棉增加、東部雖有霜、然眾意棉收已畢、無足輕重、其後股市及他種物價上升、同業活動買進、市價挺秀、計現貨漲十一磅音、期貨漲十一至十五磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌二三點、印棉初因歐洲出口商買進而堅、後因投機家賣出、多頭了結、及利物浦消息不佳而疲、計平果爾跌〇·五至〇·七五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·五至二·五羅比、白羅溪跌二羅比、原電錄左、（十六日電）</p>
<p>平果爾　一五七·五〇　跌〇·七五　二七·八〇</p>

<p>白羅溪　二一五·二五　二·〇〇　三八·二〇</p>

<h3>上週蘭貢輸出棉花量</h3>
<p>十六日孟買電、上週目蘭買方　輸出之棉花數量、共五三九噸、內至神戶者三二五噸、至馬尾者八力噸、至大阪者七一噸、至長崎者五四噸</p>
<h3>三品紗花升漲頗厲</h3>
<p>十七日大阪電、三品期紗漲一元九角至三元二角、近月為二百三十八元、遠月為二百十二元八角、期棉漲四角至九角五分、近月為六十五元九角五分、遠月為六十六元七角九分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布去路川滇最旺</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面續堅、國內紗花平穩、而一品美棉俱告上漲、人心極其健旺、各貨售盤均殊堅穩、實銷次第發展、以西南諸區為最佳、昨川帮滇貴帮續辦在色貨印花絨馬布士林雅布綫呢直　嗶嘰色斜白細布粗布等貨三百餘件、惟曰閩各貨添訊大部岑寂、前訂低價貨額派到漸旺、而報裝不湧、一部份已在滬回出、蓋以粵閩市面　難轉機、湘鄂贛皖各區實　繼續不衰、浙路寗紹金衡嚴等地實銷形回蘇、而　州台州仍無　　、陕豫諸帮均漸有　機、辦去以嗶嘰直貢綫呢白絨居多、天津帮白貨蓋胃仍呆、昨色貨頗有辦進、成交內外　君子嗶嘰八十濱、及各華廠綫呢三十餘箱、本街生意仍以絨布為最活潑云、</p>
<h3>糧食　實銷停寂　期粉麥上落甚微</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份星初穩繼定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四角左右、加拿大好一角零、故開價時、人心微見震動、近期較好近分、遠期則較好一二分、惟本埠廠方、因目下實銷不暢、對遠期會有拋售、致市氣又復漸軟、本月份至三月份、與前日相仿、四月份反小去半分、迨至下午開盤交易轉淸、各月份均趨盤　　　旣　、投　　難以利用、　各路糧價、亦已停寂、買戶當然觀望不前、此後如無特殊變化、常看盤旋云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤各月份出入甚少、因洋麥雖見續佳、惟以吸戶甚稀、出戶亦多觀望、致雙方互擯、交易淸寂、因洋麥雖不能合劃、就國內米估相較、則麥價已並駕齊驅、回顧事實、轉使買戶踟蹰不前也、迨至下午開槃、交易仍不暢、近期各月份比較略軟、遠期平穩、觀察前途、恐須盤旋一時也、現麥市面、仍然平靜、上落甚少、開特高貨五河窰灣麥八元零五分、紹興麥五元九角三分、全市南京東台麥五元八角五分、共開一萬餘包云、</p>
<h3>黃豆全為大連操縱　　近日黃豆市況、全被大連所操縱、大運市一日間波浪之速、</h3>
<p>趨緊所以市塲中之氣象、有賣買不能互相應呼之態、致採辦裏足不前、祇有零星問津、統市成交不滿　千包、榨油廠又不出大價、前途趨勢、恐不易過榮云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市繁榮將吿一段落</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、顯見　足回跌之象、紐約交易所行盤、俱見低落、計日絲八三及七五勻度、暨上海絲廣東絲等、各下跌一分、遠期貨標準絲跌三分半、近期貨則下降五分之譜、折台申市、則每担生絲下跌二十元强、橫濱絲價同見回小、計現貨跌二元、期貨跌十二元、里昂絲市、則較堅好、日本絲及上海絲之B字等級者、均稍漲、其餘亦各守原價、申埠絲市、刻因國外絲價低落、限價太苛、致外銷絲又吿停滯、觀察月餘來堪稱繁榮之絲市、至現今時日或又將吿一段落矣、昨日內銷絲、亦殊寥寥、幸行盤尚無二致、全日白廠及其他絲經、共售開六十包云、</p>

<h3>國貨與南洋商業攷察團</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨在南洋之地位，近年以來，江河日下，幾無復昔日之盛況。蓋國內工業界，旣不措意於此，而歐美日本，憑藉其優厚之勢力，侵佔併奪，聲勢日巨，南洋與國貨，旣不能成一聯帶名詞矣。</p>
<p>今歲七月，中華工業國外貿易協會，組織南洋商業玫察團，以三十七廠之出品，在高胡二團長領導之下，前赴南洋各地，如菲列賓，新加坡，吧城，檳城，棉闌，泗水，暹羅，西貢各地，為期四閱月，為程一萬數千里，始於昨日歸國，載譽而回，各界熱烈歡迎，以慰勞全團同人於海上，甚盛事也。五人認為此次南洋商業攷察團之所得甚多，舉其犖犖大者，有如下列：</p>
<p>（一）為以國貨眞相示人，使僑胞朋白年來國貨之進步，確有未可淺視之處，夕期而引起南洋僑胞愛用國貨之熱忱。聞所辦之國貨展覽會，每日參觀者率在一萬人以上，允留南洋人士以極良好之印象。</p>
<p>（二）為國內廠商與南洋僑胞之聯絡感情，以此次之力量為最偉大。不但聯絡僑胞感情，且各地政府彼此間情感旣通，一掃已往隔膜之弊病。此次全團所至一地，必得當地政府與僑商土生之盛大招待與歡迎，此為以前所未有，而玫察團諸君已克奏其效矣。</p>
<p>（三）為得到僑胞對於祖國之信抑心，僑胞見祖國出品有如此優美，工業界領袖有如此人才，一腔熱誠，油然而起，以致紛紛購貨定貨，並願代為經銷，甚至願辦中華國貨公司與介紹所，以等國內切實合作者，此種親愛精誠之態度，實為南洋通商以來所未有，亦為玫察團諸公克奏其功。</p>
<p>基此三點，吾人敬以十二分之熱望以卜國貨在南洋前途，實有無窮之光明。</p>
<h3>國貨運動聲中　兩個寶貴的建議</h3>
<p>— 訪問員—胥松子</p>
<p>「選聘女訪問員，分往家庭談話，與主婦研究辨別國貨常識，並探詢各主婦對於各項國貨之批評，俾轉吿各廠家改進。」</p>
<p>這是本會—上海市國貨運動聯合會指派我們出發家庭之前，所發表的訪問旨趣。</p>
<p>現在，家庭訪問工作已開始兩週。雖然，我們每天要碰着不少軟硬釘子，有時用盡了種種方式，敲不開主婦的門；雖然因了社會的不景氣和「敎育程度的不平衡，我們會處處受到「募捐的又來啦」，「一定是女騙子啦」，「强拉硬賣的的推銷員啦」等等惡劣觀念的阻撓，可是，事實上，我們却衝破了不少的難關，我們的工作，不能不說是在比較順利的條件下邁進了。</p>
<p>我們的工作是艱苦的，但是我們在工作中得到了無上的歡愉，無上的酬報呀！</p>
<p>我們得到的酬報是什麽呢？那是一般主婦的感情欵待，我們之間心的共鳴。聽哪他們不是在說：</p>
<p>「我們都是中國人呀，我們的血管裏都是流着中國的血。國難不能說是達到預點，買外貨是多麽忍心害理的事呀」</p>
<p>不但如此，更值得記憶的是主婦們對於國貨運動的建議。是啦，根據訪問旨趣，對於主婦們忠實的意見，是值得誠意接受而加以改進的。只有這樣，國貨運動才會進展，國貨市塲才有躍進的可能。綜合她們的談話，可以作為下面兩個寳貴的建議。</p>
<p>一，建立國貨諮詢所。</p>
<p>建立國貨諮詢所，問題是重大的，理由却很簡單。因為家庭訪問只是短時期的工作，最大限度的效力，僅在一時給主婦們一個好的印像，我們為了使訪問工作的力量能夠維持於永久，唯有在本埠各區的中心地點建立國貨諮詢所，俾各該區家庭主婦，就近前來諮詢。因為愛用國貨是誰都知道的，但有一般奸商，喪盡天良，貪圖近利，而每以外貨冒牌國貨，使購買國貨的人不能辨別眞偽，時常興高彩烈地去購買物品，雖經仔細審查，結果，却是胃牌的外貨，甚至於劣貨。這時，一片熱誠，却換得滿腹的悲憤！因此，各區國貨諮詢所設立，不但可供主婦的諮詢，且可及時宣傳國貨新出品，以供主婦們採用。所以是很切要的一個工作</p>
<p>二，各區國貨公司設立之必要。</p>
<p>誠然，我們已有了規模很大的國貨公司，足供愛國人士的選購國貨。但日常用品，家庭中多臨時添置，求之一般商店，或不甚可靠，如往南京路等處購置，就未免不便與多費。假若能在各區，甚至於各較大的馬路，設立明顯的國貨公司，（規模大小都沒有關係），使一般主婦得明確知為國貨，又因近便關係，勢必向國貨公司購買，是無疑的</p>
<p>上面的建議，只能說是很概括的意見，至於具體的辦法，却有待於國貨界諸先進暨社會士女加以發揮贊助呢！</p>
<h3>提倡國貨的四要主義</h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>提倡國貨，這是近年來全國有識之士的一致的呼聲。然而，照筆者的意見看來，提倡國貨的成續，所以還不能十二分的顯著的緣故，實在由於一般的同胞，不能實行四要主義所致。何謂四要主義？請看下文：</p>
<p>（一）要樂用國貸：中國人應用中國貨，這是天經地義，無可諱言的事實。我們對於國貨，應該要有一種樂於購用的熊度，無論一針之微，一紙之消費，凡有國貨可用的，無論如何，總應該以購用國貨為前提。大家有了遺種樂用國貨的精神，國貨事業的前途，自然會發展迅速，達到那成功的境界。</p>
<p>（二）要原諒國貨：有人說；『我不是不願意用中國貨，實在因為國貨和非國貨比較起來，實質上遺相差一些，我為耐用起見，不得不忍痛的去購買外國貨。余非樂用外貨也，實不得已也。』抱這種態度的人，在現社會上，恐怕不在少數，我認為我們對於國貨，應該抱着原諒它的態度，在國貨的實質方面，雖然差些，但因為這是咱們中國的國貨，我們還是要樂於購用它，原諒它。有了這種原諒國貨的精神，外國貨才根本不能在中國的市塲上，大量的傾銷着，而中國的經濟國難，自然也有了解救的一天。</p>
<p>（三）要督促國貨：提倡國貨，不特在消費奢方面，應該儘量的服用，同時，在生産界方面，也應該積極的改良，才能達到完善的地步。我們對於一般的國貨，認為有改良的必要的，應該秉着至誠，實獻給國貨生產界，督捉他們設法改良，能夠這樣，國貨的實質，才有進步的可能，而為消費者所樂用</p>
<p>（四）要認識國貨：末了，該談談國貨的認識問題。目前有許多人，為了不認識國貨，以致於誤購外貨，和×貨的，眞是很多很多，這是應該設法補救的一件事，所以，我們對於國貨展覽會，要多多的去參覜，增加對於國貨的認識力和辨別力。例如最近上海市商會所主辦的國展會，現正在展期閉慕中，對於國貨不大認識的同胞們，是很值得去看一看的。</p>
<p>短訊　自偽蒙匪軍進攻綏省以來，塞北風雲，突吿緊張，刻號由傳作義將軍指揮作戰，然前錢將士，處此冰天雪地中，為國效命，給養方面，在在急需後方援助，本埠正泰橡膠廠主人，有鑒於斯，除糾合全廠職工人員，捐集鉅資，由本館什滙前方外，復捐贈回力球鞋二千雙，亦由本館代為轉贈，甚望各大公司工廠，聞風起而效允，則在前錢作戰將士，當感惠良多云，</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （范顯微）</p>
<p>世間有兩種臉面最難瞧，除病榻上垂死的病人和刑塲待槍决的死犯血外：一是挺胸凸肚的富翁，得産者和討債人的臉，—一是彎腰曲背的貧人，—失業者和借錢人的臉，前者的一言一動，處處顯露着驕慢的態度，非色色樣樣占上風，討便宜不可，令人見之生氣—後者却絕對相反，處處顯露着侷促不安之狀，脅肩諂笑，無徽不至，大有『眼前喫虧還小事，惟盼對方寬一着』之慨，眞令入見之作噁！</p>
<p>機會好比是天上的風，人好比是船上的帆，有風而不揚帆，自己放棄權利，有帆而沒有風，當然也沒有辦法，這全在船老大的自己斟酌。不過風勢雖好，最犯那帆駛得太足，寗使讓個一二分的好！那麽又快又穩，否則設不定一個風塊兒打來，桅折船翻，反而不美，若問機會在那裏？不必從遠處找，說來一錢不值，就是『抓住現實』四個字哪！</p>
<h3>「搶落花」</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>紅樓夢中『黛玉葬花』的一事，傳為後世美談。他如『數落花』咧『掃落花』咧，『詠落花』咧，也都是高人逸士們的閒情雅興，值得入們羨慕的。但這裏所說的『搶落花』，花旣不是那種祇供人欣賞的壯丹花芍藥花芙蓉花之類，而他們的搶落花，也絕對不像高人逸士們用以消遺的閒情雅興，而是出於飢寒的驅迫。原來那花是棉花，而那從事於搶落花的，更都是那些沒有辦法維持生命的飢餓的羣衆呀！</p>
<p>又是這個時候了，那種搶落花的情景，在遇到故鄉的來人後，又在我腦中映演起來。原來鄉農們對於自己田裏的棉花，當然很仔細地去收集，但無論如何仔細？總不免要遺下一些殘餘的或遲放的棉花在那裏，而在鄉農們也不願再費工夫去檢拾了。故在那時，一般貧苦的鄉人，照例地把全家男女都四散出發去從事於搶落花（一稱『拾落花』）的工作：他們用那尖銳的眼光，縝密的觀察，敏捷的手腕，迅速的脚步，拾取那為常人所不容易見到的為蟲類蛀蝕過的或給枯葉黏附的殘落的花朵。這樣，他們一整天上所拾得的落花，豐富時候，也可得到三斤五斤：於是把一家人在這一時期內所拾得的落花，再加一番去污與分類的手續，把較好的拿到市上去易錢換米，殘蝕的打成了棉絮，備作禦寒之用。這一來，總算解决了他們一部份的飢寒問題，所以他們常常會對人說：『我們不是在搶落花，是在搶性命。』好在這種舉動，在以前，田主們是不很干涉的。</p>
<p>可是近年來却不對了，田主們自己也在受到飢寒的威脅，那裏再願意任人來拾取他們所有的落花？於是一邊禁止搶落花者踏入他們的田內，一邊自己去作那搶落花的工作，所以，現在的貧苦鄉人，再沒法去搶他們的性命——落花了。唉！</p>
<h3>象牙肥皂</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>我的芳隣陳老先生，在若干年前已失去了他的雅篆與大號，而老是給人稱為「象牙肥皂」，在陳老先生自己，也承認這個尊稱是名實俱副的，他在光復以前，曾做過一任巡檢，在光復以後，也曾帶過什麽諮議的頭銜，因此在這裏，雖不是頭等的鄉紳，至少也是個令人敬畏的大人先生，他平時舉以為痛心疾首常擺在口頭上的，在巡檢任上，曾因祝縣尊姨太太的壽而化了幾兩銀子的壽禮，祗落得一頓吃喝，一天奔跑，雖事後曾得到一個「某員辦事幹練」的獎語，但總是覺得這是生平破天荒的費鈔。</p>
<p>陳老先生喜朋友，在路上，他雖帶着老花眼鏡，總是喀開笑口，不件顛頭，因此也有人稱他為「建神麯」，—見人曲—尤其動於酒樓菜館的訪朋友，其實陳老先生的酒量是很小的，四兩杜紹，已足夠使他臉紅耳赤，但肉量則不小，準張的蹄子皮可以一捲而盡，他老是自誇地說：「朋友太多了，每天三餐，至少要吃喝五六年」。這確不是他的吹牛，我們每見他醉熏熏油膩膩的在路上很滿意的徜洋着。</p>
<p>陳老先生是很節儉的，喜素人家，無論識與不識，總翻着老賬致禮，但道喜或弔唁，則必親自躬臨，席上，老是喜和小孩子同桌，他說：「小孩子是最天眞爛縵」。他最愛吃蹄子皮，便老是把竹筷指點着蹄子，嚷着「蹄子要封面了，」接着便一捲而去，於是又有人稱他為「蹄子封面」。</p>
<p>陳老先生沒有妻室兒女之累，他除了應酬與喝酒以外，每天的光陰，有大半要化費在茶館中，而且不拘大小茶館，他都是老茶客，他踏進了茶館便從眼鏡下把目光掃射全堂，在他點頭笑聲之中，便會找到了茶友，於是也有人尊稱之為巡查—茶—御史。</p>
<p>但陳老先生有時也大聲疾呼道：「我究竟是象牙肥皂，碰到了無孔不入的鐵洗帚，這才使你們感到煩惱啦」！</p>
<p>換巢鸞鳳</p>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金的指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>友梅緩緩的在旁邊椅子上坐着，把手托了頭，垂下了眼皮，想了一想，因笑道：我雖沒有經過這種境遇，但我仔細的想着，我要是你，我的情緒，一定也是這樣，心裏的話，簡直談不出來的。因為你為人就比我安定周密得多。　了這個時候，你都是道樣皇皇不能自主，我這樣粗心的人，還找得出一個頭緒來嗎？夢體道：那是你觀察錯了。你那樣豪爽的人，不能像我這樣優柔寡斷，就不會這樣不可救藥的境遇。在你自己，早想出一個解决的法子了。友梅巳是把兩手向上，撐托住了下巴，眼望了屋頂，點點額頭道；當然，我不願在舊禮敎下犧牲的。不過我的家庭，比你的家庭，也還高明不了多少。唉！我們早出世二十年也好，晚出世二十年也好，偏偏生在道過渡時代。旣如道我們是有天賦自由的，但是又得不着自山。夢蘭並不接住他的話，那是更深的歎了一口氣。只在這時，却聽到樓梯登登的嚮着，夢蘭便向友梅搖了兩搖手。小菊隨着在門外呌道：小姐，我在門外呢，呌我不呌我？我是把手指頭塞了耳朵上來的，你們說話，我不聽到。友梅道：小菊，你現在還塞住耳朵嗎？小菊沒作聲？友梅道：你怎麽不作聲，這丫頭好大胆。小菊道：我答應了，不是沒　住耳朵，聽見李小　說話了嗎？友梅道：你現在作聲了，到底聽見我說括了沒有呢？小菊笑着跳進門來，將兩個食指，塞住了兩耳朵笑道：李小姐，你看你看，我塞耳朵沒有？夢蘭歎了口氣道：小菊，你的命比我好。你無憂無慮，什麽也不知道，我們拜讀了上十年的書，一點也不如你。小菊撤了嘴道：那是天翻地覆了，小姐還不如丫頭呢？我知道，小姐，又在發牢騷了。他兩隻手，已是放下來，不曾塞住耳朵，將右手食指，一面打着自己鼻子尖，一面點着友梅笑道：李小姐對我們太太說了，一定把我們小姐勸得回心轉意。你呌我不要吿訴，我小姐待我好，我不能不吿訴的。這一套話，說得梅蘭二人，都格格的笑個不了。（九九）</p>
<h3>治藝的精神</h3>
<p>— 郎魯遜</p>
<p>周閩藝女士研究繪畫，已歷二十餘年，她早離開學校的生活，現在已是主持　　的主婦，還是一個小孩的母親，現在已不容許她像在學校裏將她全部的精精和時問沉醉在繪畫裏。她不能例外，同旁的女人一樣，不用設她會有家事的累贅，家庭裏瑣細的雜務要她操勞，但她並不荒疏她的藝術，在家務之餘，仍不斷努力研究，我曾看見多少有為的女子都葬送在家庭的環境裏，每使我為她們前途惋惜！今周女士根本否認了女子宿舍論，看了周女士歷年大量的作品，更給我們證明了女子在家庭不一定會完全淹沒了她們的天才。</p>
<p>女子治藝的態度，就是對藝術不視作一種消遺而當他是一種事業，他更有的依藝術的宏願，日與調色板和畫刷為密友，二十年如一日，不幸嚴重的打擊突如其來，「一二八」的無情砲火，將周女士日積月累的晝稿，焚毀殆盡。卽她平日所收藏的書籍畫片，亦均葬身火窟，不圖道種重大的打擊，不獨不能摧毀周女士的雄心，在「一二八」後反逆來順受，重整藝事，因年來更較前勤奮，所作的畫，在量的方面，雖不及以前多，亦質的方面，顯然有一個新的形式。那種優美的線條，溫麗的色彩，深刻感人的表現，無疑的給我個認識時出諸一位因打擊的鐵治，而更堅强的藝人的手筆。</p>
<p>此次周女士友輩，再三慫恿，將「一二八」以後的作品，精選油畫百餘點，在上海舉行個展，因特記數語，以作介紹。並望周女士仍機續過去治藝的精神，倍加努力，在今後的藝壇上，有偉大的貢獻，有如在繁星間閃耀出一顆奇瑰的慧星。</p>
<h3>視聽之娛</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>秋來不雨，蒔菊就受了很厲害的影響，　菊家號　節灌溉，也遺不能滿足，前幾天，天公稍降甘霖，菊遂破蕊怒放，海上應時菊展，一時風起雲湧，不勝枚舉。滬西漕涇「冠農」乘時崛起，邀客觀賞，我因居處密邇，不免前去觀光一番。</p>
<p>「冠農」栽菊三千盆，去年今日，也曾轟傳，這回還和蒔菊著名的「小觀園」合作舉行，並且有金魚書書參加，所以更見盛大了。進鬥的「宋梅」周遭，圍列了許多「立菊」，一本數百花，甚覺壯觀，望梅軒中，高拱細種十餘盆，一枝挺秀，丯恣嫣然，壁懸淸代名家字畫二十餘點，的是珍品，為名醫瞿直甫先生家藏，不標價格，完全供人欣賞而已。</p>
<p>銅獅一隅之大草坪上，堆菊成山，式樣也很美觀，高與屋齊，益見偉大了。綠蔭草堂周掛時人書畫，中如張聿光　鶴，朱大可題句，韓國鈞行書聯，金梁古篆聯，錢瘦鐵合錦畫屏，均足稱贊，總數近百點，餘均平庸血已。</p>
<p>長塲列五色「滿天星」，遙望倒也可觀，據洗經理相吿，這幾天許多顧客賞菊之后而斥資購菊者，日有數十起，卡車都來不及分送了，可見醉心風雅人士不以市面不景而儉省的。</p>
<p>金魚亦陳盆分置於草地，標名列號，頗淸晰耐看，種子也有二三十種之多呢！</p>
<p>賞菊之后，被莊梅生君邀到酒家吃蟹，忽爾途中逢着湯君修梅，又折至恩派亞戲院去賞識賞識白玉霜的新排評戲「西廂記」。</p>
<p>我於蹦蹦乃門外，朋好嘗力繩某伶如何，其伶如何，我都未去聽過，今日看了白伶的西廂，恰與京戲中的西廂無甚不同，詢之湯，方知評戲中本來沒有這齣戲的，也是新從京戲中改編得來，白風騷蝕骨，無怪顛倒者大有其人了。</p>
<p>秋深，意緒粉雜，偷得浮生半日，也居然極視聽之娛了。烏可無記。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>女堂倌在上海</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>女堂倌任遊戲塲走走的朋友，替伊們提一　雅號呌做玻璃杯說起了上海的女堂倌，倒也有過不秒　艶　軼事在我的記憶上，上海的游戲塲，最初僱傭用女堂倌的一家，是神仙世界，那時神仙世界的女倌，都是招考　來，錄取之後，經過相常的訓練，才分發各茶堂服務。以姿色說來，神仙世界的女堂倌中，有幾個的確還算不差，穿着一色的服裝，在遊客中間，端了茶杯像穿梭般的在來去服務。除了女堂倌之外，神仙世界每一個茶堂，管茶葉的，管錢的，也都是年輕的姑娘，伊們當然比較有些知譜而受過相當敎育的。後來，雖然一年不如一年，退步起來，但比較上在幾個遊戲塲中，神仙世界的女堂倌，還是超人一等呢！</p>
<p>神仙世界的塲子旣小，遊藝又不多，但有過一個時期，曾轟動不少遊客，便是女堂倌的號召之力。那時在上海這部市中，有過不少遊蜂浪蝶，醉翁之　不在酒，為了女堂倌而去逛神仙世界，甚至大學生，也有不少和女堂倌曾發生過桃色案件。看上了一個女堂倌，天天去泡茶，事實上祇有兩角錢一杯茶，可是給一元的也有，兩元的也有，甚至五元，十元也不希罕。女堂倌在這種惡環境下，常然有不少是為了金錢而被人誘惑了。結果女堂倌便形成了出賣肉體的女性中的一種，雖然裏面也未始沒有一部分是潔身自好，不給人誘惑的</p>
<p>自從跳舞之風，在上海大盛之後，玩女堂倌的人似乎減少。到了現在，不景氣的來臨，巳把整個的上海，弄得非常簫條，各業都受到莫大的影饗，女堂倌自然也不能例外，黃金時代早已過去，泡壺茶給一兩塊錢的瘟生，也早已沒有了。雖然每一個遊戲塲還是有女堂倌僱着，但祗是一種點綴而已</p>
<h3>從「御香縹緲錄」初版到四版</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>本書從發行單行本的第一版起，祇七個月不到，居然又要加印第四版了有許鑫友好因此都向我道賀，以為這是很榮譽的事情。我也不用說什麼假話，當然也是覺得很欣慰的。不過在半年以內，由初版而四版的書，在國內外出版界中，正是數見不鮮，無足希罕；而且統計起來，也祗七八千冊書，不曾上一萬，這樣的銷數，眞還夠不上稱龐大兩字。</p>
<p>再進一步說，因為我是這本書的譯者，對於它的內容，當然是認識得最淸楚的一個人；所以如其有人問我：「你希望不希望這本書再五版六版的出下去？」我必然回答「不希望。」這例倒不是因為我已將本書版權售與申報，自己無甚利益的緣故，而是因為這本書的內容，除掉對於一切人，事，物都有很細膩，很深刻描寫，並且容易逗人發笑之外，實在沒有什麼多大價值。尤其在這個國難日深一日，民族存亡巳將於最近判其正負的緊要關頭，我以為民衆所需要的讀物，應該是富於刺激力和血腥氣的作品，决不是這種東西！</p>
<p>這本書在申報按日發表的常兒，輿論界和批評界方面已曾一再加以評論或指正，在單行本發行之後，在理我很該送養本書給各方面，請求指敎。可是因為年來本人意志很消沉，閉門謝客，絕少交遊，更不敢自命為文人，所以也從不曾把道本書向各大作家求敎過。就為這個緣故，在這半年以內，我竟沒有見過有那一位先生好好地給我下過完滿的批評。所見到的祗有兩種文字，一種是就事實方面，力加攻擊，一種是隨便選錄　段事實，為之轉載。這兩種態度我認為都是錯誤的。前者是以歷史家的眼光來批評一部小說，禾免失之太正經，後者是以捧角家的手段來捧一本文藝作品，未免失之過火。因為這本書的長處絕對不是敘事的眞實，所以考證既不必，轉載也無聊。</p>
<p>現在第四版快出版了，我深切地祈望已經讀過這本書的各位先生或女士，能夠賜給我若干有價值的批判。（惠件謂寄本刋轉）</p>

<h3>畸形社會的罪惡：……淋病白濁之由來及解决</h3>
<p>— Dr．Y．U．Duncun著　日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>……淋病混合治療的創聞開歐洲近百年來醫學發明之巨響　……威聲遍及全球多數臨床醫家爭相採用治效有無上價值　……國家頒賜動章在烈獎勵之下另有男女外用治淋之法發見</p>
<p>在今日資本主義社會中，許多畸形發展恒足障碍人類之幸福，若娼妓之發達，舞塲之林立，實為人類罪惡之淵薮，靑年墜落之陷穿。一切花柳惡疾，固莫不由此傳來！</p>
<p>夫梅毒與軟性下疳，旣有適當之治療，而自古被認為最難治之淋濁，至今日乃成為醫學界最重大之問題。或則以透膜殺菌行局部治療，然屢次失敗在今日早巳證明其無效。由是淋病能否根治，當茲淋病瀰漫橫行之時，允為一般男女病家所急切希求解答者！</p>
<p>人類所懷望淋病療法終由理想實現而獲得醫學上之空前成功！蓋有Mayer　M．D．博士細胞原增加學說，已應用於淋病治療也。</p>
<p>其學理卽係採取動植物之類脂肪及類脂汁，施於人體，促進患者週身抗淋素，以殲滅淋毒必使絕其根本，並增加患者細胞活力，俾患部如尿道攝護腺精囊及畢九炎等之組織壞疽，得以早日恢復；照常生育子嗣。其他因淋毒而來之遺精早洩等，亦可迅歸廖愈矣！此種有效療法，只有「克淋儂」為最新獨創者！因「克淋儂」係以類脂肪及類脂汁（蛋白體）製成，對於白濁白帶之男女淋病，不論急性慢性，男子遺精夾血，女子子宮炎爛，赤白帶下，服以「克淋儂」無有不迅獲全部良效，永遠斷根不發。惟女子白帶，宜同時外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥。至於淋病男女外治方法，則有最近德製「抗淋水」Anti　Gonococi-Aqva可供男女外用洗滌陰道或尿道，更易排淸生殖器內部膿濁也。</p>
<p>英國Docetur氏及法國淋病專家Dr．Delbet博士，均證實「克淋儂」與「抗淋水」之治淋特效。本齊且得皇家醫院之獎章云。</p>
<p>性的故事</p>
<h3>兩性愛情的炸彈</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>智慧果的害人</p>
<p>縱使對妻子千依百順依然得不到愛的安慰原因為靑春腺組織受傷故有此不幸惡果</p>
<p>自從亞旦夏娃誤吃了那魔的智慧果後，男女間就種下愛的根苗，這根苗就是我們人類的性慾。有了性慾，才能有愛戀的事情。人類就是這樣綿延下來的。那麽今日許多兩性所發生的悲劇，都是由於智慧果的害人了。其實這不過是宗敎家的話。以我們醫學的立塲上說起來，兩性的愛情，實在建築在性慾上，而性慾的發源地，就是靑春腺了。許多正在發育的靑年，因為被荷爾蒙的刺戟，及外界的引誘，釀成了手淫惡癖，或者因發育未全，早婚色慾過度，把靑春腺弄壞了。性神經頓時陷入衰弱之境，而來發育不全，早洩，遺精，勃起力不堅。假如患了上面的症狀的人，萬不可結婚，假如不自量的結婚，因為性的不滿足，恒使妻子陷入痛苦的深淵，做丈夫的雖千依百順，依然博不起妻子的同情心。唉！手淫眞是愛情的炸彈啊！</p>
<p>但男性這種悲哀，不過從前的事，現在因為已有德國梅倫氏發明的「補體康」了，此劑是勇壯動物荷爾蒙所製成，對於因手淫或色慾過度而致靑春腺委弱，性器矮小，遺精，早洩，陰萎等，在五六星期中治愈。我自俄國勞動大學醫科畢業返國後，開業以來，曾用此劑治愈。一方姓靑年，彼年廿二歲，長不滿五英尺，性神經衰弱。備受妻子之嘲刺。憤不欲生。經我介紹服「補體康」至二個月後，卽獲得正常發育。一方用耐而斯遺精片而治遺精云。</p>
<p>肺病與攝養</p>
<h3>根據科學指出滅癆良法</h3>
<p>— B.I.Iasinsky著南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師譯</p>
<p>……社會不景氣聲中肺病者如何可度此緜縣長日　……必須認識此最合經濟的特效療法以迅復健康</p>
<p>肺之本身固無知覺，故肺臟內部病變，至如何程度患者毫無自知之明。肺癆患者，往往內部巳有徑寸之空洞，而全不自知者。其抵抗力薄弱者，亦祗覺欬嗽咯痰，發熱倦怠，甚或咯血等事，初不能知肺部有無若何病灶也。</p>
<p>若夫胸部有刺痛感，亦祗肋膜炎痛，非關肺臟。</p>
<p>以故肺病之療養，必要較長之時間，俟熱度退盡以及</p>
<p>欬痰全無</p>
<p>始能放心認係治愈，而可信內部確已結疤也。此事對於初期肺癆病人及有癆症嫌疑者，允為重要。蓋初期病人，每不耐於持久療養。或在傷風欬嗽，潛伏肺癆危機之時，亦不加注意則悔之晚矣。</p>
<p>及至咯血</p>
<p>查今日歐洲最新有效之肺病治療法，乃在壓縮肺部之弛緩，使血行淋巴行減慢，因而阻止酸素之供給。由此癆菌因缺乏酸素而皆相繼死滅，終至根本消除，</p>
<p>癆病根治</p>
<p>卽巳見諸事實矣！如人工氣胸術等皆根據此理。而內科的藥物『補肺拿爾』其學理與實效，亦莫不由此點出發。故木劑功效</p>
<p>超過一切</p>
<p>服後卽可降熱止血，寗　化痰，飮汗增食。若　　神經衰弱，失眠遺精，則宜並服男用『補體康』或女用『補女容』可也。</p>
<h3>可怕之女子神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>…有變成歇斯的里之危險，　…是家庭間最不安的病人。</p>
<p>女子之發育，通常較男子為早，原因不外於內分泌之關係。但許多女子多因家庭父母强迫結婚，或不良伴侶引發自凟，遂不獲充分之發育，如乳房臀部等處，均於發育半途而止。尤其是神經衰弱症最為可怕。而月經不調，白帶交流，婚久無孕，腰酸膝冷，失眠心悸，行動遲鈍，其儀態亦因月經不調，貧血，脂肪減少之關係變成瘦削萎黃。凡患此等病狀之人，恒為家庭人所厭，故精神益覺萎糜，悲觀，而釀成歇斯的里症，更為和樂而愉之家庭的重大打擊。</p>
<p>憶余曩日從南通醫科大學畢業以後，對於此症之處理，恒用德國「補女容」一藥，作根本的解决，因此劑係用荷爾蒙所製成，能調整卵巢機能之失常，俾月經趨於通順，又因體內荷爾蒙之激增，從前因缺乏荷爾蒙而來之乳房與臀部發育不全等，均立能促其發育，於是遂改變其悲觀之心理，神經之增强，觀念之正確，於是所患之歇斯的里症旣可除去，又因月經之通順受孕力之恢復，他如新陳代謝機能旺盛，肌肉充實細膩，衰老之皺紋皆可退淨，而為一妍態動人之好女子。惟息有白帶者，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以除帶。</p>
<h3>淋毒性尿道之腐蝕</h3>
<p>— 姚菊嚴醫師</p>
<p>患者尤筱雲。疇昔之夜，為妓所惑，遽染淋毒，後又誤行粗暴之尿道洗滌法，致將尿道粘膜破裂，反為淋菌所乘，致尿道上有數處被腐蝕之小孔（如第一圖），此由余用尿道鏡檢查始發見上述病態。此症如不速治，則勢將尿道管穿孔而失去生殖之機能也。遂行手術與電療後，同時囑服德國「克淋儂」，以殺菌消炎，鎮痛防腐利尿，更時以「抗淋水」作尿道之洗射，使淋菌無立足之地。在四星期中，所患己去，排尿便利，痛苦已除。復用尿道鏡檢查，則尿道平復如恒矣。（如第二圖）。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>此為未服「克淋儂」前尿道腐蝕成穴，將有穿孔之勢。</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<p>服「克淋儂」及外用「抗淋水」洗滌後病灶已除平復如舊。</p>
<h3>白帶病談片</h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>……婦女白帶，為不孕與傷害健美之主因</p>
<p>一般婦女，對於白帶，多不注意，以為此等病患，僅不過極一小毛病而已。豈知暗中傷害生殖系之健全，而來不乳之結果，卽不然對健美上亦大有影響。凡患有白帶病之女子，其眼之四週，作深灰色之眼圈。於健美上大有妨害。患者大多陰道糜爛，惡垢下注，生殖系統因受其刺戟而發生種種病態，如月經不調，小腹膨脹，刺痛，於房事與小便時均感莫大之痛苦</p>
<p>對於此症之適當醫治，據歐美各國婦科專家之實，以外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為外用坐藥，最能防腐止泌消炎鎭痛殺菌之效。故能在三四星期中，卽可將速年白帶掃淨。惟亦當鑑別其原因而分別治療，如因淋病而來者，可兼內服德國「克淋儂」，因月經病而來者可兼服「補女容」，庶收根本治療之效。此法且可在家自療也。</p>

<p>（診所）：四川路寗波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>如何可免轉入慢性淋</p>
<p>患淋病並非一種十分可怕之症狀。只要在傳染後處置得當，决不致惹起其他續發症及併發症之危險。因續發症與併發症，多見於慢性淋。治療卽較困難。故凡初患淋病者必宜十二分注意其療治方法。如何可使早日脫離淋毒痛苦，如何避免症狀之惡化？大概與不潔之異性接觸後，在三五天之後，卽有淋病象徵出現，如尿道作痒均痛，其後痛楚加甚，尿意頻數，包皮翻轉，尿道泌膿血，數星期之後，痛楚症狀漸減。淋菌亦由前尿道侵人後尿道，及攝護腺炎，精囊炎，輸精管炎，睪丸炎等症，於生育上有莫大威脅。</p>
<p>惟在將入慢性期時，如挽救有方，則尚可免去。有住嘉興路鄭木齋君，前月因誤為同學誘惑，從某跳舞塲折入娼寮，致罹淋病，雖經醫二三星期，但痛苦並未減少，膿血交流。乃丐余醫治，經余檢查結果，鄭君之淋菌有一部巳竄入後尿道，幷有攝護腺炎之趨勢，惟病根未久，祛除尚易，乃囑服德國「克淋儂」，以嗆菌消炎，外用「抗淋水」以掃滌尿淸道而淸除局部之淋菌，惟鄭君誤購其他劣藥，致病勢轉變，乃仍囑其購服「克淋儂」購時認「克淋儂」三字，服後果於三四星期中全獲到根治。當服「克淋儂」時，余一方用長短電波交互治療，於三星期中，鄭君因事離滬。乃囑一方外用「抗淋水」，按說明書在家自己洗滌治療。兩星期後，接其來函云，淋病已愈。且經當地醫生檢查證明云。</p>

<h3>性能低减之挽救</h3>
<p>— 英國Moore著　留俄楊道醫師譯</p>
<p>發育不全和手淫後遺精早洩衰弱之治療　靑春腺萎靡將影響個人事業與家庭幸福</p>
<p>吉鵬Gibbon氏說：『女人是善變的動物』。這話是說明女性不易駕駑；新時代的男子，應該怎樣搏取對方的熱愛，和堅固　的情懷，實在是件要務。</p>
<p>愛情的最終線，老實說：完全是建築在性生活上面。美滿的性生活，不但可增進精神的愉快，而事業方面也都將受到間接的良好影響。失去健全性能的男子，他簡直沒有鴛禦妻子的力量；我們不要繁微博引，或打起假道學家的旗幟。假使想一想歷史上的許多有名故事，就可了然性能的健全實是每個男子所必須認眞的事。但我這裏不是要提倡催淫，乃是挽救性能低弱的苦痛。</p>
<p>本病的症候，先天性者為稟賦薄弱，所以多身體矮小，性器發育不全。後天性則多係少年無知，誤犯手淫或房事過多，以致箭傷性器，摧毀靑春腺，濫費了荷爾蒙精液。所以有遺精早洩，陰萎不舉等症候。在現今各國最通行的方法，都是以餌服靑春腺荷爾蒙劑「補體康」為主，在服後卽可獲　發育强大的美滿效果。如遺精頻仍則宜兼服『耐而斯遺精片』以鞏固精關了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>所謂「中日談判之錯誤」</h3>
<p>— 川琦</p>
<p>一方面以飛機大砲來侵奪我國領士，而另一方面却又提出若干條件來跟我們談判，其中的深意可知。</p>
<p>在我們鄰邦看來，似乎中日兩國的關係之不能調整是由於中國方面之排日運動所造成。因此非「根本剷除」不可，甚至要「訴諸其他斷然方法，以達到其目的。」</p>
<p>至於排日運動之所以造成，則又以為「調整關係旣為極端艱難之工作」，自不應拿，阻止發生不幸事件及調整關係兩問題，同時提出，更以威脅之姿態，從事工作，結果時間經過愈長，則愈足激動排日運動。然而他們却忘了在談判之際，又以飛機轟炸平地泉，和以大軍進攻綏柬綏北，這不知是否所謂「斷然方法」？</p>
<p>自從九一八以來已經整整的過了五個年頭了！在這五個年頭裏，我們的鄰邦在我國土內造成了不少的不幸事件，如：奪取東北五省，冀東，轟炸上海，操縱華北，以及目前正運用大運和嗾使蒙軍進攻綏省！五年來，多少的同胞被殺害了，財物損失了，這些我們並沒有忘掉，更因着這種不幸事件之不斷的發展而時常刺激着我們的回憶。</p>
<p>當然，以威脅的姿態來提出各種條件是會激動排日運動的，而斷然停止談判華北防共問題，及其他與排日不幸案件無直接關係之問題就能發現調整的途徑麽？問題並不是這樣的簡單，要尋找調整的途徑，自然是非「根本剷除排日運動不可。」但要根本剷除排日運動則須根本剷去造成排日運動的各種成因。這就是說：日本當局應絕對禁止有任何足以引起中國反感的行為和撤銷一切的旣成事實。如撤回在華駐軍以及交回所佔各地等。這樣，則排日運動自會無形的消滅，而兩國的關係自然而然地會調整起來，而不幸事件更會永遠不發生。反之，現在一方面要求調整，而一方面又以飛機大砲來屠殺我民眾，而造成新的不幸事件，則兩國關係無由調整，反愈足激動排日運動，眞是大錯而特錯的。</p>
<p>總而言之，假使我們鄰邦當局一旦不停他們的侵略為，則調整的希望無異緣木求魚。</p>
<h3>援綏</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>前見報載江都縣監獄囚徙，以全國各地節約一日，獻諸國家，特於本月十一日，絕食一日，將欵轉獻政府，以作充實國防之用，並請全國同胞，節約一日，貢獻政府，以換取民族國家最後勝利，囚徙是犯罪者，以在監獄的囚徙，已經判處徙刑的囚徙，他們還不亡國家，不亡同胞，並不亡綏邊衛國衛民的將士，肯絕食一日，去貢獻政府，他們的囚糧，一天祇有多少，他們情願絕食以供給綏邊衛國衛民的將士，倘並不是囚徙，而貢獻政府者，並且不須絕食，於此比較之下，未識作何感想。</p>
<p>日本川越大使與張外長談判，已經七次，為期已一月有餘，至今還沒有一些結果，據昨日電訊，中日談判，勢將結束，眞是俗語所謂「三日三夜，談了一個將何之」，將何之儘管將何之，猶可說也，而一方面儘管談判，一方面儘管作軍事行動，詭計多端，神妙莫測，這種行為，安可聽共自由，而不加以嚴厲與有效的制止，此而不為，則談判本屬多事，而交涉亦為具文，决非我國民所屬望於外交當局者也。又據十四日集寗電，十三日夜，匪騎兵猛撲綏東防地，昨晨四時，方始繫退，某方飛機九架，偵察平地泉，又據十五日歸化電，某方軍官參加匪部，綏東發生前哨戰，匪部運輸甚忙，正在積極準備軍事行動，此種行為，安可以尋常土匪目之。</p>
<p>惟援綏運動，有兩種最當注意，一是物質上的援助，一是實力上的援助，物質上的援助，我國民是能夠帮忙的，而實力上的援助，非我國民所能帮忙的，據前日消息，綏邊防禦工作，異常堅固，器械亦極充足，惟麫粉問題，尙成缺乏，並且綏邊苦寒，軍衣亦須接濟，此種衛國衛民的將士，安忍使其枵腹疆塲，凍死溝壑，而不急起直追，解囊援助，故平津各地發起援綏運動於先，京滬各地，紛起贊助於後，我想愛國之心，人所同具，此種援綏運動，不久可普遍於全國，這固無容為之過慮者也。</p>
<p>惟此次匪軍進攻，據友邦聲明，與友邦無關，完全屬於內政問題，此說果足信乎？，據集寗電，某方有飛機九架，偵察平地泉；據歸化電，某方軍官，參加匪部作戰；則綏邊匪禍，决非僅屬土匪侵優可知，並且看他們的計劃，因整個談判不成，於是用一部份一部份侵略之法，如是可用力少而成功多，我們若僅恃綏遠的軍隊，而各處軍隊，並不加以援助，實是危險萬分，故現在的援綏，不僅須要物質上的接濟，而各處實力上的接濟，尤為重要急迫，凡我國民。當大家起來做救綏運動，凡我軍人大家起來做救援運動。</p>
<h3>談讀報</h3>
<p>— 子英</p>
<p>在這動盪的時代中，世界各處每天發生的新事件，不知萬千，由於現代新聞事業之發達，新聞網之佈滿全球，各通訊社每天擇其最緊要而對全人類發生直接或間接影響之事件，供給各地報紙刋載，又因現在國際間之一切政治經濟機構，為有嚴密之組織，而更增加其重要性。例如羅斯福之再護選為美國大總統，各國政治評論家卽爭相評價其對本國發生何種利害關係，法國之放棄金本位，使各國學者羣相研討其對本國經濟之影響。所以你若是二十世紀人類社會之一員，欲認淸你所處的時代，你所屬的國家，你自己在本國中所處地位之重要，每天非閱讀報紙不可，否則你的生存是盲目的，你將成為時代的落伍者，所以閱讀報紙是每個能讀報紙的人每天應做的工作，可以說是日常生活的一種，與你每天必需吃飯一樣重要。而尢其現代中國人民，國家在生死存亡的關頭，每個人民都應該密切注意嚴重事態之演變，如最近在南京談判之中日交涉，綏遠駐軍與蒙偽軍所發生之衝突，均有澈底瞭解之必要，而後表示正當之民意，這種民意是一種偉大的力量以督促政府，政府决不能也不敢加以漠視的。</p>
<p>但是中國實際的情形實在太可憐了，擁有了四萬萬七千萬的人口，最大日報之銷數每天不過十餘萬份，與美國著名日報銷數動輒數百萬份相比較，我們眞是渺小得可憐，卽與日本比較，重要一些日報的銷數也在百餘萬份以上，其原因一方面固然由於我國敎育之不普及，文盲之衆多，而許多受了敎育，甚至受了最高敎育的大學生，有很多也沒有閱看報紙的習慣，眞可痛心。而女子方面情形更壞，在學校讀書時看報的已是很少，一出了校門，結婚以後，簡直與報紙絕了緣，這是放在我們眼前普遍的事實，誰也不能加以否認的，但我們應該知道女同胞佔了我國人口的半數呢！雖然，女同胞中認識字能讀報的人本已很少，這少數能看報的人而也不看報，這確是一個嚴重的問題，值得我們注意的。至普及敎育，為另一問題，容後論之。每一家庭中的人常受主婦的影響非常厲害，設或主婦能熱心看報，注意本國及國際間政治經濟的動態，其他各人也會被她感化的。總之，我們應該發動一種讀報運動，使全國能讀報的人每天都讀報，沒有讀報能力的，也應設法使之知道在報上登載的事實，我認為這正如日本軍部最近發表小冊子內所謂目前日本最重要的對全國人民之智慧實施普遍的動員的好方法，在精神國防上一定能發生很大的作用。</p>
<h3>寒夜貨聲</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>周作人先生在「一歲貨聲」中，說到北平冬晚買「硬麵餑餑」的人的夜深的悲哀的呌喊。使我們沒有到過北平的人，廢書異想。這和永井荷風的關於浮世繪的一節文字中：「賣宵夜麵的紙烟，寂寞地停在河邊的夜景」二語，同樣使我歡喜，因為在夜晚，我往往忘記了世界和本身的存在。而「深夜的貨聲」或則做小生意的烟火，或則憑着耳朵，或則憑着眼睛，使我覺到自己還停留在這有機的世界中。</p>
<p>深夜的貨聲，大概總以買宵夜食品的多罷，白日做完了事的人，在深夜，找朋友閒談，不覺夜深。那時，正覺得有點饑餓，恰巧有買消夜東西的人走過。用着他的喊聲驚動了談話的人，就出去買些吃吃，實在非常有趣的。</p>
<p>我們不知道北平的有硬麵餑餑買，是什麽時候開始的。在南方，現在消夜的東西是很多的。而見於著錄者，似乎還只有餳糖一種。</p>
<p>顧碌的「淸嘉錄」九月中「餳糖」一條云：</p>
<p>「士人以麥牙熬米為糖，名曰餳糖，寒宵担賣，鑼聲鏗然，凄絕街巷。蔡雲吳歈云：「昏昏迷霧已三朝，準備西風入夜驕；深巷賣錫寒意到，敲鉦渾不似吹簫。」</p>
<p>蔡雲這首詩，還不能脫掉頭巾氣。而顧碌的「鑼聲鏗然，凄絕街巷，却多少使我們得到在寒夜的西風裏，鑼聲漫起的凄涼。</p>
<p>「餳」，楚詞註，謂之「飴」。卽古之銀鍠」也。吳人呼為糖。牠的所以一定要到秋冬之間，才買者，因為那時「風燥糖脆，利人牙齒。」蘇州府志「餳，出常熟直塘市者，名蔥管糖；出崑山如三角稜者，名麻糉糖。」而吳歈註更云：塞宵多賣「餳」者，夜作人「資以療饑。」嘉善錢行西詩：「餳挑夜担聞鑼賣，」則吳市之所以寒夜買餳者，幷不是給閒人的消夜，而是給「夜作人」的療饑。更使我們對他發生「勞作的人間味」的好感。</p>
<p>現在買餳糖者，已經不限於吳市的寒宵了。上海的里巷中，隨時可以看到敲「手鑼」的買餳人，不過，他們大都不再買錢，而交換些破衣爛鐵等荒貨了。</p>
<p>北平的「硬麵貯貯」聲，旣然凄厲悲涼，得直刺入人心，而吳市的寒宵的買餳鑃，也「凄極街巷，」這不外是生活的艱難，和浮世的寂寞促成的。</p>
<p>在上海，「夜的貨聲，」是非常多的。但是都市的晚問，已經和白天沒有兩樣，所以，我們也不大容易找到和白天不同的貨聲了。廣東人的買橄欖，是會使最好耐心的人，也要發怒。而秋初買</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>白果的聲音，也只是遲緩和悠揚，已經不復是「靈魂的呌喊了。至於買洋貨的人的歌唱，更使聽到的人，立刻不愉快，他們已經到了用惡劣的歌唱來逼人購賣的地步了。</p>
<p>將入中年，少年的豪情，完全沒有了，而於這種小地方，反而特別的留心。「甚矣我衰矣！」</p>
<p>秋深了，接着來的是漫漫長夜的冬天，我到底在什麽時候，可以去吳市聽買餳糖的鑼聲，我到底在什麽時侯，可以去北平聽「硬麵餑餑」的呌聲呢？我實在給買洋貨的聲音呌得夠了！</p>
<h3>地底下的人們</h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>—貴州的煤礦工人—</p>
<p>一匹山連接着一匹山，沒有中斷，沒有休止，把整個貴州放在山的包圍里；就在這數不淸的山中，不可勝計的富源埋藏着。</p>
<p>煤，是其中重要的一種。</p>
<p>它的埋藏處多半是在粗壯的，少生草木的山底，經營煤業的人，就在山麓鑿一個洞，斜斜的向下，直達有煤的地方；有時要延長到幾里路也說不定。</p>
<p>彎着腰才能鑽進洞里，但走不了幾步，就必須匍伏着像狗一般的爬才行。這斜斜向下的地洞，普遍只有半人高，二人寬；在這里面看不清一切，甚至於看不淸自己的身軀。必得把手當「觸角」，去　聽是不是應該轉彎，要不然，頭就會毫不客氣的碰在岩石上。這里面還常積着一些水。很滑，規模小的坑，地底只有一條路，大的坑，就以煤的貯藏量和資本的多少而開闢許多支路。</p>
<p>煤坑里的工人有幾種，一種就是在坑底挖媒的入。這個地方，比較地道要高些寬些，但挖煤的人，却不能不常常仰臥着去鑚鑿煤地。</p>
<p>煤坑里，在一般人想來，是充塞着刺鼻的煤氣的，其實並不然，恰恰相反，里面却一點媒氣也沒有，因為這是「生煤」。所以使工人痛苦的却是一盞燈，這燈用的是桐汕，而芯子又是差不多有小指那般粗，不斷的把桐油烟子放散出來，而洞里，空氣又是不流通的，新工人對於這種氣味，更感到苦惱，只要鑽進來，他們的肺就像被什麽撐着，難以呼吸，並且，不要幾分鐘，頭就像被什麽東西塞得緊緊的。但是不能不在坑里，要作八小時的工作。而且，在坑底工作的人，常常有遇險的可能，不幸而頭上的煤塊鬆潰，倒塌下來，他們就會被埋藏，幸運一點的，也會傷掉一隻手或一隻脚；這些，老板說是「命不好」，最多也不過施捨一口「火燒板」吧了。</p>
<p>每天八小時地不見陽光，呼吸着桐油姻，川盡力去　堅硬的煤礦搏門，却只換得一吊多錢（約合三角餘）。</p>
<p>另外一種工人，是拖煤的，他們的工作是將拕好的煤拖出洞外去。</p>
<p>拖煤的工具是一隻竹籃，他們呌做「船」，這船，可容一兩百斤煤塊，每一次，他們要像狗拉車一般把他一兩百斤媒拖出去，而且路是漆黑的，是崎嶇不平的，所以他們在爬行時，常常打着唿哨，這是關照前面的來人，要他們停在比較寬的地方，好讓他拖過去。他們的工資比挖煤的還少，每天不過一吊錢吧了。</p>
<p>在洞中，不論春夏秋冬，他們都是赤裸着不穿禮服，就是拖煤的工人，也很少穿褲子的。</p>
<p>這兩種工人的人數此較多，普通，只有一條地道的也各有數十人（分三班工作。）支路多的地方，要增加到幾百人。在地面上工作的，人數就比較少了。</p>
<p>其中有一種，是搧風的，把空氣從另外鑿成的小洞裏送到坑底，要這樣，燈才能點燃，人也才能生活。</p>
<p>還有，就是燒煤的工人了。燒煤的地方就在洞口旁邊，成圓形，直徑的有三丈。每晨，在燒煤的周圍，男的女的，甚至於十一二歲的小孩也有，站立着，等待煤燒好後（熟煤）運到幾十里路外的城裏去賣。他們忍耐着繚繞山谷的媒烟，讓那特殊的臭味刺射着他們的鼻子</p>
<p>附近，一個個的草棚搭着，就是工人們的住屋了。屋裏面，完全墊的是稻草，一個三方丈的房間，常常會睡上十幾個人。在他們住屋裏，總能尋着幾盞鴉片烟燈，差不多每一個煤坑工人，都有烟癮，不吃烟，他們就不能淸除那過分的疲勞。</p>
<p>這種工人，在貴州要上萬數，但因為是用原始的方法在工作，他們雖費了過分的力量，媒量生產還是有限，以致本地的很多居民還沒有煤燒。</p>
<h3>到西貢的第一天（續）</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>然而又半點鐘過去了，人們依然在毒熱的太陽光下曝炙着？各人的臉上流着斗大的汗水，穿着短衫的人的上衣全給汗浸透了。驟然，一個穿着制服的中國人出現了，他喊着說，「喂，排隊，排隊！</p>
<p>人們莫明其妙地看着他，一面又自動擠着排成兩行，許多有家眷的男人牽帶着自己的女人和孩子，但穿洋裝的人就嚷起來：</p>
<p>「女的歸女的，男的歸男的！」那聲音是異常的兇惡。</p>
<p>「先生，我不認得路呀！我們在一起有什麽呢？我們已生了三個孩子了！」</p>
<p>十分鐘後，我們排成兩隊，女的一隊先行了。我們跟在後面。許多荷槍拿着皮帶藤條約人站在我們的兩旁。但這臨時的隊伍一走下吊橋之後，馬上便紛亂起來，許多女人想走回來尋他的丈夫，許多男的想上前去找自己的妻子。有些人想跑在前頭，有些人想出去跟自己的熟人說幾句話……於是猛烈的皮鞭便像雨點一樣的落在各人的頭上，一邊用着粗劣的語句罵着，叱着。人羣一看見揚起了的皮鞭，便抱頭避開擠成一團。在路上，駡聲，哭聲，鞭子落在肉上那低沉的，像燒紅了的鐵棒落在水里那樣的聲音溶成了一片。</p>
<p>我的希望破滅了。我的後背給沉重的鞭子鞭了二下，在人羣里，我不知不覺地大哭起來。我想：這正如一羣亡了國的奴隸正在被鞭笞着走向刑塲，而對於遠在彼方的，一向鄙棄的唐山，便油然生起一種愛戀之情來。</p>
<p>十五分鐘後，我們在一座洋樓之前停了下來。想着那未來的一切的苦難，我不禁抖顫起來。</p>

<p>梅羅香</p>
<p>梅蘿香回到上海有六個月了，一直沒有戲唱；起先還有一點兒儲蓄和首飾等物質典了來度日；但是日子一久，坐吃山空，經濟便發生問題了，連房租也已有三個月沒有付了。</p>
<p>住在後面亭子間裏那個唱紅生的秦四天，僅僅是朋友而兼同行的關係，因為最近也失了業，便常常跑到梅蘿香的房裏來談天。有一次他無意間講起那個明新舞台的大股東白森卿，他呌她不　我他去想法子</p>
<p>梅蘿香幾乎被他的話有點兒說動了心；但見到馬子英每天總有來信說前途不曾沒有完全失望的時候，像打了個强心針似的，又不想再投降白森卿那裏去。</p>
<p>白森卿也知道了她近來生活窘困的情形，于是買通了思想墮落的女戲子筱春蘭用種種的方法來誘惑梅蘿香。梅蘿香終于和現社會一般的女子一樣，有時候似乎理智很强，有的時候還是敵不過物質的引誘。結果，她還是投降白森鄉的圈套中去了。</p>
<p>梅蘿香和白森卿同居了兩個月，彼此都似乎感到有點兒懨倦起來。</p>
<p>突然，梅蘿香接到馬子英寫來的一封快信，他巳在鼓浪嶼開金鑛發了財，今天，就要到上海來和她實行彼此所誓的盟約。這，可把梅蘿香進退兩難了！</p>
<p>她跪在白森鄉面前要求答應她仍舊跟着馬子英去，白森卿起先徉作不肯，後來便答應了她。其實，他對於梅蘿香的熱心早巳冷淡了的。</p>
<p>但是，馬子英會不會原諒她這次意志薄弱的過失呢？……</p>

<h3>「風月無邊」中之無邊風月</h3>
<p>茀雷亞斯坦和琴述羅吉絲兩人的戲，凡是看過他們兩人主演的「雨打鴛鴦」「楊柳春風」等片的人，當然是覺得十二分滿意的。現在這一對舞國的權威，又在雷電華的充實的資本和精密的指導之下，完成了一九三六年最新型的歌舞巨片「風月無邊」。內中跳舞的塲面極多。並且借了劇情的進展，參若舞蹈的節奏，益見得生動有致。名歌有六七支。全是音樂巨擘傑羅密寇恩氏的傑作。劇情非常輕鬆滑稽。對白更是俏皮幽默，茀雷和琴琴述二人，飾一對舞蹈戀人。兩人翩翩起舞的時候，軟玉溫香，一個像蜂，一個像蝶。在光滑的地板上，踏着風靡美州，波盪全球音樂最新發現之「流動」（Swing）旋律，個中情景，眞包含着無邊的風月。該片聞將於本星期四，在大上海和國泰兩家戲院中，同時公映云。</p>
<h3>「生死同心」主題曲</h3>
<p>我中華英勇的男兒快快起來一齊上前綫，全國被壓迫的民衆已不能忍受這橫暴的摧殘，滿懷的熱血已沸騰，滿腔的熱淚總不乾，不將軍閥掃盪誓不生，不將暴政推翻誓不還！難道黑暗世界總存在，水遠不能到明天？快趕上前，快趕上前，前面有無數的同志們正在鏖戰着，勝利就在眼前，舊世界等候最後的裁判，新社會已在等候我們改建。</p>
<h3>「女同學」趣屑</h3>
<p>冷波在「黃浦江邊」中學會推小車，在「女同學」中飾一木匠，每日又學推鑤及鋸木等工藝，文導演對他說：「如果你再拍幾部戲，把各樣工藝都學會了，就是不吃電影飯，也不愁沒有吃飯的本領了！」</p>
<p>蔣鏡澄髮已禿頂，光可鑑人，開麥拉·曼拍他的戲，最怕他頂上反光射入鏡頭。</p>
<p>王慧娟前因鼻樑太低，特延美容醫生施行手術，鼻樑居然高起數分，較前美麗得多。</p>
<p>范雪朋飾一盲婦，有一决正在扮着瞎眼練戲，陳玉梅走來交她鈔票一捲，她立刻收了放入衣袋，大家都笑她見鈔眼開。</p>
<p>陶金和王慧娟都不會猜拳，偏偏有一戲塲要二人猜拳，文導演臨時敎會了他們，但一上鏡頭，王慧娟常常伸了二個指頭呌「八仙」，伸了四個指頭呌「兩好」，錯誤百出，拍了不少N．G．。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Flew to Taiyuan, Received Important Military and Political Figures, Yan Convened a Bandit Suppression Conference, A Wang Arrived in Taiyuan Yesterday to Meet Chiang</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Qian Dajun and others, arrived in Taiyuan at 2:30 PM today, traveling in two airplanes from Luoyang. Yan Xishan, Zhao Daiwen, and various high-ranking generals, as well as various organizations, groups, and schools of the New Life Movement, lined up outside the North Gate to welcome them. Chiang exchanged brief pleasantries with those who greeted him, and then rode into the city in the same car as Yan, staying at the Four Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters on Xinmin Street. Chiang and Yan held a lengthy closed-door meeting to discuss national affairs. Subsequently, Chiang met with Zhao Daiwen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Tang Enbo, Men Bingyue, Zhou Dai, and others, inquiring about everything. Yan hosted a banquet at the Pacification Headquarters tonight. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan Xishan convened a military conference this morning at the Pacification Headquarters, gathering various high-ranking generals to discuss matters related to bandit defense in eastern Suiyuan. Zhao Daiwen, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Zhou Dai, and others were all in attendance. The generals unanimously expressed their determination to obey the Central Government's orders, follow Director Yan, lead their troops to defend the territory with unwavering resolve, and fulfill their military duties. The meeting adjourned at noon, and instructions were telegraphed to Fu Zuoyi and others. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan Xishan hosted a banquet for Chiang tonight, inviting various generals to accompany them. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shijiazhuang reports that A Wang, the Deputy Chairman of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council, arrived in Shijiazhuang yesterday. This morning, he departed from Shijiazhuang for Taiyuan to visit Yan and discuss political affairs.

<h3>Sir Eric Teichman's Speech: Traveling in Inner Mongolia, Extremely Difficult Conditions in the Desert, Very Slow Car Progress</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Eric Teichman, Counselor of the British Embassy in China, spoke at the Royal Geographical Society yesterday about his recent journey by heavy truck through Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. He said that travel by its nature contains adventure, and the hardship of traveling in the Gobi Desert cannot be described in words. He stated that he was very pleased when the truck speed was able to reach 10 miles per hour. Sometimes, after driving all day, one could only advance a few miles. In addition to carrying ordinary repair tools and parts, it was also necessary to carry iron shovels, wooden boards, reed mats, ropes, and specially made cranes. Moreover, due to the rugged terrain along the way, it was necessary to use first gear for a long time, resulting in extremely high gasoline consumption, with an average of only four to five miles per gallon. The distance from Suiyuan to Kashgar was 2,550 miles, and the trip took 38 days. With better equipment, it could be shortened to within a month, but compared to the usual four to six months needed to ride camels or drive donkey carts, it was much more convenient. The best car route from Beipingliang to the new province cannot be used because of the Soviet Union's blockade of the Outer Mongolian border. (17th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>From Shanghai to Xi'an (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>"Fly, fly, fly to the east, fly to the west..." As a child seeing off a certain passenger sang this familiar song, the Eurasia Aviation Company's "Junkers" aircraft, truly carrying the reporter and three other passengers, floated into the clouds and soared into the air, flying over the Longhua Pagoda. At that time, the pagoda, temples, houses, bamboo, trees, etc., seen from above, gradually shrank: shrinking into models that could be played with in the palm of your hand. Looking far into the distance, I could see a thousand miles at a glance, reminding me of being on a ship in the ocean. However, the seascape is flat and monotonous, while this [airscape] is ever-changing and peculiar. Below, an endless expanse of newly cultivated wheat fields, crisscrossed by paths, the soil a brownish-yellow, like countless baked pancakes and biscuits, thrown back piece by piece. Interspersed with winding silver streams, clusters of green trees yet to shed their leaves, brilliant red maple leaves, and hills that did not clearly show their height or peaks. The complex scenery and diverse colors came into contact with my eyes, and I could not help but be captivated. After flying for a while, the attendant brought a full cup of coffee and two pieces of pastry on paper plates. The paper plates were placed on my lap, and I ate while holding the cup and spoon, quite composed and at ease—this was of course due to the smooth flight of the aircraft and the perfect internal facilities; let me jot down some notes below.</p>
<p>The aircraft we were on was a three-propeller aircraft (the propellers in the air can turn 1,800 times per minute), with a load capacity of 2,000 kilograms, with eight passenger seats. If crowded, it could be increased to sixteen seats, plus two pilots, a telegraph operator, and a servant, for a total of twenty people. The two pilots sit side by side at the front of the aircraft to steer: the telegraph operator is next to the middle, writing and translating the weather reports sent by radio from the stations ahead, and notifying them at any time. The passenger seats are in the abdomen, just like the seats in a movie theater, with four or five rows (they are movable), each row can seat two people, separated by the window wall, with an aisle in the middle. Above the car window, there is a net pocket for storing light items. A thick silk ribbon runs along the window wall. If the weather changes drastically and the aircraft suddenly encounters a thick air layer and rises one or two feet, or suddenly encounters a thin air layer and falls two or three feet, you can grab the ribbon if you are afraid of dizziness. Moreover, a strong stream of thin air runs through the middle of the ribbon. If you really feel dizzy, you can also release the air ball to blow some fresh air into your face. When the aircraft flies at an altitude, if a passenger suffers from heart disease and feels difficulty breathing, they can notify the attendant to turn on the oxygen cylinder for use. The altitude from Shanghai to Nanjing is mostly between 600 meters and 900 meters. When passing through the mountainous area between Henan and Shaanxi, it only reaches 1,300 meters, which is not very high, but that day a passenger "ugh"ed and vomited out the pastries they had just eaten in the morning, but it did not soil the pure land of heaven, because the seat was already equipped with a vomit bag. There is also an enameled toilet in the tail for occasional urination and defecation.</p>
<p>This type of aircraft was originally a new German military aircraft. The side of the fuselage's chest and abdomen facing the ground (the upper half of the back is for passengers) was originally used to install bombs; converted to a civilian aircraft, it is used to store luggage and mail. But in times of emergency, with the addition of a machine gun to the tail, it can still be converted to a military aircraft.</p>
<p>Just after flying for a short time, the aircraft skimmed over a few small hills and discovered Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and half of the city circle bathed in the morning mist. Needless to say, we had arrived at the first stop, Nanjing. Looking at my watch, it was 7:16 AM, subtracting the 6:50 AM departure time, the journey lasted only one hour and six minutes. But it is not fast enough. If you take a streamlined propeller aircraft, it only takes fifty minutes. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>People's Front and Social Mass Party</h3>
<p>— Yunnan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the Japanese government has further suppressed the "People's Front Movement." The arrest of many progressive intellectuals, the suspension of many magazines, and the military's ban on employees of government-run military supply factories from joining labor unions are all direct and indirect blows to the People's Front Movement.</p>
<p>According to spokespersons for the government, the People's Front is for defending the motherland, opposing fascist forces, and is advocated primarily by the Communist Party. However, the Japanese government's "rural relief policies," "nationalization of electricity" policies, etc., all have a national socialist character and do not tend toward "fascism." Moreover, Japan itself has not been subjected to foreign invasion, and there is no Communist Party organization in Japan (?). Therefore, there is no need for Japan to form a People's Front. If it were to be forcibly formed, it would only promote division and antagonism among the people of Japan (see Nogi Hokan's "Analysis of the People's Front," *Era*, November issue). But what is the truth? Reality precisely shatters this embellished facade, and the Japanese People's Front Movement is actively unfolding on a realistic foundation.</p>
<p>Although Japan does not have a very powerful fascist party, there are clearly fascist forces within various political parties. Furthermore, the "National Alliance" (one of Japan's political parties) is explicitly aligned with Germany and Italy. The number of fascist groups outside of political parties has already exceeded three hundred. Japan's fascist forces rose to prominence alongside Japan's activities in Manchuria. The main reason for this rise was the intensification of the domestic economic crisis. This is exactly the same as in Italy and Germany. The intensification of the economic crisis often strengthens the opposition and struggle among the ruling classes. Due to this opposition and struggle, fascism arises. At this time, fascism is often seen as a new pillar and a new force for the ruling class.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has failed to solve general social problems. Domestically: the low living standards of workers, farmers wandering on the verge of starvation, the annual expansion of military spending, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed, the excessive issuance of public bonds, and the implementation of mass tax increases are all sufficient to cause the rapid decline of people in the petty bourgeoisie. Externally: relations with the Soviet Union are increasingly tense, with constant disputes over "fishing area issues" and "border issues"; relations with Britain and the United States are also very acute due to the China issue and conflicting interests; and within China, rising anti-Japanese sentiment and the national salvation united movement are all sufficient to make the Japanese people feel the threat of war and feel that they are living on the eve of war.</p>
<p>These domestic and foreign problems greatly help the development of fascist forces. Correspondingly, the government's policies also significantly display fascist tendencies. For example, the "nationalization of electricity bill" and the "administrative reform bill" are all roads leading to fascism. The parliament has completely lost its function, and the representatives are practically non-existent. As for the political parties, their only function is to cooperate in promoting the establishment and implementation of fascist policies. This has become the current reality in Japan, which is a fact that the Japanese ruling class finds difficult to conceal. At the same time, it is also the important reason why the Japanese people must strive to form a People's Front.</p>
<p>In July 1932, Japan's "National Labor-Farmer Masses Party" and "Social Masses Party" merged to form the "Social Mass Party" (hereinafter referred to as the Social Mass Party). This was an expression of responding to the demands of the masses, uniting in a common front, and confronting fascist forces. In addition to the above two parties, the formation of the Social Mass Party was supported by the "Labor Union Council" (among organized workers in Japan, those belonging to the Labor Union Council are said to account for seven-tenths) and the "Japan Farmers' General Alliance" (most of the national farmers' associations joined, making it the mainstream of the Japanese farmers' movement). What is particularly noteworthy is that the "Tenant Farmers' Alliance" (composed of a large number of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists and general salary earners) also became one of the supporting groups of the Social Mass Party.</p>
<p>What does this phenomenon illustrate? It means that the formation of the Japanese People's Front did not begin today, but only has the name "People's Front" today.</p>
<p>Although the Social Mass Party has received the support of many of the above-mentioned groups, it itself is still unable to develop healthily. On the one hand, this is due to the suppression of fascist forces, but on the other hand, it is also due to the lack of correct understanding on the part of the Social Mass Party's cadres themselves. Some of them even say: "Because the goal of workers and peasants is to overthrow capitalism, we should first unite with the fascists to overthrow capitalism." Such a view has already become a bodyguard for the fascists.</p>
<p>For the sake of the important goals of the Party, the Japanese people have theoretically fully criticized the Social Mass Party, but strategically, they still attempt to expand the united front centered on the Social Mass Party. This can be seen from the unprecedented victory of the proletarian parties in the general election in May of this year. The proletarian parties want to occupy a unified political front to launch a struggle against fascism. After the "February 26th Incident" this year, it seemed on the surface that the fascist camp had already been shaken and split, but in fact, the fascist forces had become even more expanded. After the "February 26th Incident," the oppression suffered by the masses was even greater than before. Therefore, the masses' demand for a unified political front was even more intense than before. The labor unions and "Farmers' Associations" that had previously held a critical attitude towards the Social Mass Party also began to form a unified front centered on the Social Mass Party based on the wishes of the masses.</p>
<p>However, the Social Mass Party itself does not have the determination to unite various forces outside the party to form an anti-fascist People's Front. Even though the "New Labor-Farmer Proletarian Groups Council" has been established, they clearly wrote in their declaration: "...With the goal of forming a People's Front, unite various forces other than the Social Mass Party on the anti-fascist front, and then join the Social Mass Party to form a broad and solid People's Front." But the attitude of the Social Mass Party's cadres has always been extremely exclusive.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) Some of the party cadres have fascist leanings.</p>
<p>(2) They are afraid that cooperating with the new forces chanting "People's Front" will reduce the prestige of the Social Mass Party's leadership.</p>
<p>This attitude of not recognizing the enemy and treating politics as child's play will naturally cause the disintegration of workers within the Social Mass Party itself, which will undoubtedly occur. Moreover, further, it is feared that it will also cause the masses to despise the party. Because under the heavy pressure of high tides, the People's Front Movement is no longer a matter of ideology but a political movement. Since its strength has already risen among the masses, what power does the Social Mass Party have to stop it?</p>
<p>The reason why the Social Mass Party opposes the People's Front is: "Forming a People's Front will only stimulate the other side, giving the government an excuse to suppress the labor movement." However, this reason has not been adopted by the masses, but has instead aroused the masses' resentment. As a result, a People's Front Movement has formed that will break away from the guidance of the Social Mass Party's leadership and be automatically organized and automatically developed by worker groups, farmer groups, workers and peasants belonging to the Social Mass Party, and some unorganized masses outside of the Social Mass Party.</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Labor Research Department of the Japan Political and Economic Research Institute, on August 27, with the support of several labor groups, the "United Promotion Committee" passed a resolution stating: "It is necessary to unite all proletarian forces, with the Social Mass Party as the center, in order to realize a unified anti-fascist political front." At the same time, the "Labor-Farmer Council" also issued a statement that if the Social Mass Party accepts the proposals of various groups and opens its doors, the "Labor-Farmer Council" will also join the Social Mass Party unconditionally. The Social Mass Party responded specifically to this request on September 2, proposing three conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Each group must individually declare its support for the Social Mass Party.</p>
<p>(2) Each group must participate in the "Labor Union Council."</p>
<p>(3) Upon joining the party, one must join the branch to which one belongs in an individual capacity.</p>
<p>However, the Social Mass Party cleverly rejected the Labor-Farmer Council. The reason given was that for the sake of the organizational relations of the political party, it must be considered individually. However, on September 4, the "Labor-Farmer Council" again made an unconditional request to join. There has been no concrete result to this day. In short, regardless of the intentions of the Social Mass Party's cadres, the force that erupts from below can always promote the development of the Japanese People's Front.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Aid-Suiyuan Movement</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In these past few days, our highly respected General Fu Zuoyi, along with his brave and skilled soldiers, is fighting a life-and-death battle against the so-called puppet bandit army commanded by a certain power outside Zhaizhai, amidst the freezing cold, for the sake of the motherland. This kind of heroic and arduous battle is of great significance in the historical destiny of our country. According to information from the front, the puppet bandit army, carrying modern military weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and heavy artillery, has launched fierce attacks on our army's positions in Hongge'ertu many times since the evening of the 14th. Airplanes marked with a certain country's insignia dropped more than a hundred bombs. However, because our army's morale is high, every attack has been repelled. The enemy is now continuing to transfer puppet troops from Duolun and Rehe to reinforce their forces, preparing to continue their fierce attacks. It is said that the enemy's planned strategy is to break through our army's defense line in Xinghe and Taolin, invade Zhuozishan and Pingdiquan, and cut off the Ping-Sui Railway. At the same time, they will send cavalry into the Daqing Mountains, advance along dangerous routes, and raid Wuyuan and Hetao. Judging from this information, it is imaginable that an even more tragic war will soon arrive. We know that the puppet bandit army itself is mostly a hastily assembled rabble, and its combat capability is not strong. However, the international forces behind it have already been clearly demonstrated in the offensive weapons such as airplanes and tanks. Therefore, we must not regard this war as an ordinary bandit suppression war. We firmly believe that this is a war that concerns the life and death of our country, and we need the whole country to respond with all its strength.</p>
<p>This understanding has gradually become widespread among our people. In recent days, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated to the Suiyuan army's relief fund. Many scenes are worthy of praise and tears. The suspension of coal use and reduction of food consumption in schools in Ping and Hu demonstrate the rising emotions of young people. Yan Xishan's use of his inheritance to save the country demonstrates the spirit of sacrifice of the propertied class. Moreover, the request from more than thirty groups in Shanghai to establish a Suiyuan Army Support Association is especially sufficient to express the common will of the people. We hope that this kind of movement will develop as much as possible throughout the country, so that everyone will understand that their own fate is closely linked to the soldiers on the front lines, and be willing to cut back on food and clothing to fulfill their own responsibility to the motherland. Because if this bit-by-bit strength is fully gathered together, it will definitely be able to save Suiyuan, and thus save the entire crisis of China.</p>
<p>As for the government, of course, there are already well-established plans for assisting and providing for the Suiyuan soldiers. However, in view of the seriousness of the situation, we cannot help but express some of our hopes to the government. We feel that since the puppet bandit army has a strong backing and can receive unlimited supplies, we must not limit ourselves to local defense in military terms. We must make comprehensive plans in many aspects. Otherwise, "a single spark can start a prairie fire." The rebels in Spain have already attacked the capital of that country because they have an international backing. Is this not a warning for us?</p>
<h3>U.S. Asiatic Fleet Visits Singapore Naval Port for the First Time; British and American Ships Exchange Salutes; Dutch East Indies Fleet Also Arrives</h3>
<p>The U.S. Asiatic Fleet, led by Admiral Harnell, arrived here today for a goodwill visit. Upon arrival at the port, the U.S. flagship Augusta fired a salute, and the British cruiser Dana also fired a responding salute. In addition to the Augusta, the U.S. fleet also includes the Black Hawk and ten other destroyers. This is the first time the U.S. fleet has visited since the completion of the military port here. At the same time, the Dutch East Indies fleet also arrived at this time. The concentration of many warships in the port of Singapore is truly an unprecedented event. (17th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Leaves Washington to Attend Pan-American Conference; Issues Statement Before Departure; Attaches Importance to World Peace</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt indicated today that he does not wish to cancel his trip to the South American Peace Conference to interfere with the domestic maritime workers' strike. According to the President's address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the strike may continue for another two weeks. If we compare this labor strike with the impact that my visit to South America can have on world peace, then world peace is naturally more important, he said. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The government officially announced today that President Roosevelt has decided to go to South America to attend the Pan-American Peace Conference. The President will leave Washington tomorrow evening, arrive in Charleston the next morning, and then board the cruiser USS Indianapolis to head south. He is scheduled to arrive in the Brazilian capital on November 27, land there, meet with Brazilian President Vargas for a day, and then go to a certain Argentine port in the evening. He will arrive in the Argentine capital, the venue of the Pan-American Peace Conference, on December 1. The conference was initiated by President Roosevelt. The President will only stay in the Argentine capital for one day, deliver the opening speech to the Pan-American Peace Conference, and then leave for the Uruguayan capital on the 2nd for a few hours. After returning to the country, the President will probably rest in Warm Springs for a few days before returning to Washington to resume his duties. 16th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) Among U.S. presidents, only Wilson traveled to Paris in 1919 to attend the Peace Conference. Now President Roosevelt is again going to the capital of Argentina to attend an international conference, making him the second president to do so. (16th Havas)</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Negotiations; Border Commission; Issues Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev met with Foreign Minister Arita on October 20 and submitted six questions regarding the establishment of two border committees. Later, he telegraphed his home government for instructions on important matters in the negotiations. Now that the instructions from the Moscow government have arrived, the Russian ambassador visited Foreign Minister Arita at 4:00 p.m. on the 16th. The proposed requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Border Dispute Resolution Committee should be established not only on the eastern border but also on borders other than the eastern border.</p>
<p>(2) The issues to be reviewed by the Dispute Resolution Committee include the Jinchan Gou incident that occurred on January 20 of this year and events that occurred since then.</p>
<p>(3) The composition of the Dispute Resolution Committee should be based on Japan and Manchuria as one entity, and the Soviet Union as the other party, with each party selecting the same number of committee members.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied to the above items as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Two committees for dispute resolution and border determination should be established in parallel. This is the principle. The urgent task now is to establish these two committees on the eastern border as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) If past events are to be the subject of the committee's review, then all past events should be reviewed. However, Japan hopes that the committee will review events that occur after its establishment.</p>
<p>(3) Border incidents occur not only between Japan and Manchuria and the Soviet Union, but also between Japan and Russia. Therefore, the committee should be composed of an equal number of committee members from Japan, Manchuria, and Russia.</p>
<p>The first and second items can be resolved at the next meeting. However, the issue of the composition of the third item committee has not yet been agreed upon by both parties and should be discussed in future meetings. The Russian ambassador left at 7:00 p.m. (17th Allied Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance has recently decided not to establish a special account for the issue of whether to establish a special account for the study of the other party's financial adjustment payment surplus system to be opened from next year. In the general account, it is included in the transfer payment, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs manages it, with a sum of 223 million yuan. From this, it can be seen that the total budget for next year will exceed 3.5 billion yuan. The Ministry of Finance is scheduled to convene a budget cabinet meeting on the 24th to discuss this huge budget proposal. (17th Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the approval of the Cabinet meeting on the 17th, it was decided to spend 79,990 yuan from the special account surplus of the Korean Governor-General's Office to supplement the Manchurian Incident expenses. This is the expense required for border security in Korea. (17th Allied Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Speculation; U.S. Will Purchase Silver; Maintain Dollar Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>(London) Financial figures indicated today that the United States may make new purchases of silver abroad in an effort to maintain the dollar exchange rate. Under British law, silver is simply a commodity and cannot be used as an equalization fund. It is learned here that the United States does not have this law, so it is believed that the U.S. equalization fund may become an important factor in the London silver market. After the devaluation of the franc, the United States has already withdrawn 21,600,000 pounds from London. (16th National Society)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the current world economic situation still requires the United States to use its $10 billion balancing fund, and the president must still have the power to reduce the value of the currency. Therefore, before the opening of the new Congress, the government will decide whether to change its monetary policy to a permanent one. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that the United States has agreed to lend 20,000,000,000 francs to France. As a result, the prices of various securities on the exchange here have soared greatly. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials declared today that they had no knowledge of the U.S. lending to France and did not wish to comment on the news from Paris. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>U.S. Will Open Exhibition in New York; In 1939</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States will hold a world exhibition in New York in 1939 to celebrate the inauguration of the first U.S. President and the 150th anniversary of the construction of the national government in New York City. President Roosevelt has issued a declaration inviting all countries to participate in this event. Roosevelt plans to depart tonight for Charleston, South Carolina, and then board the cruiser USS Indianapolis there for a sea voyage, and plans to sail to the capital of Argentina, and will return to Washington in December.

<h3>U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike; Negotiations Begin; Awaiting Presidential; Appointment of Arbitration</h3>
<p>(Washington) After consulting with President Roosevelt on the maritime strike situation today, Commerce Secretary Roper declared that a peaceful resolution to the strike seems more hopeful. San Francisco Mayor Rossi also discussed the strike with President Roosevelt today. Then the mayors of strike harbors such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Newark, San Francisco, Portland, and Oakland held a meeting and issued an article calling on all parties to the strike to submit their disputes to arbitration. (16th Reuters)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) Since the start of the seamen's strike, labor and management held their first joint meeting here today with Undersecretary of Labor McGrady, hoping to end the labor unrest. During the week, Congressman Sims stated that there was no need to hold a joint meeting if the opinions of both parties could not be reconciled. Therefore, today's meeting is particularly noteworthy. At present, union leaders still insist on refusing arbitration negotiations. Therefore, the methods proposed by some mayors on the Pacific coast will probably be rejected. As for the content of the method, both parties will listen to President Roosevelt's appointment of an arbitration committee to negotiate. (16th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>U.S. Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Tampa - The most important labor conference in U.S. history opened here today. AFL President Green gave the opening speech and did not mention CIO Chairman Lewis, who was newly expelled from the union, nor did the CIO make any special mention of it. However, Roche indirectly criticized Lewis and called on the labor community to vigorously oppose those with personal and political ambitions. As for the dispute between industrial organizations and craft organizations, Green believes that the two organizations can coexist in the AFL. The current point of contention in the AFL is actually the issue of democracy. (16th National Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Germany Recovers Inland Waterway Navigation Rights; Britain Considers It a Regrettable Matter; Belgium and Czechoslovakia Promise to Act in Concert with France</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding Germany's abandonment of the Versailles Treaty's clauses on waterways, believing that Germany has once again abandoned the method of negotiation and resorted to unilateral action, which is regrettable. The German government has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the international waterway measures stipulated in the treaty. However, on May 21, 1935, German leader Hitler publicly declared that the German government would hereafter use peaceful means to modify the various clauses of the treaty. Hitler's declaration was notified to the British Ambassador to Berlin on May 3 of the same year. Eden continued, "In order to ensure that the needs of the German side do not conflict with the interests of the countries concerned, negotiations have been carried out over the years, with considerable success." Eden solemnly stated that Germany's unilateral action is sufficient cause for concern and will make the improvement of international relations more difficult. (16th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to officials here today, Belgium and Czechoslovakia have both promised to join France in opposing Germany's abolition of the navigation clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, and it is said that Britain and others are also expected to join. (17th Reuters)</p>

<h3>German Political Situation: Increase in Political Prisoners, Revival Rumors Again, Active Shipbuilding Program</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, political crimes have been increasing daily. The number of those arrested for attempting to undermine national security has also increased compared to before. Authorities believe this situation indicates that the activities of the Communist Party within Germany are showing signs of resurgence, causing considerable anxiety. A special meeting was recently convened, chaired by Justice Minister Gürtner, with the participation of judicial and police authorities from various regions. It was decided that the police and courts would cooperate regularly to crack down on Communist Party activities. The meeting then discussed criminal incidents related to "racial conspiracies," according to a Havas dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently reported that there are rumors of a possible restoration in Germany, and Führer Hitler himself is now considering this. "This news comes from reliable sources and should not be taken lightly. It is said that after being advised by close confidants, Führer Hitler believes that the best way to make the Nazi Party's regime last is to hold a restoration. The widow of the deposed Kaiser Wilhelm II recently traveled from Doorn in the Netherlands to Berlin twice. Other members of the Hohenzollern imperial family also frequently visit Germany, all related to this matter. The restoration plan is roughly to have Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (the second son of the deposed Crown Prince) inherit the throne, and the deposed Kaiser himself has already agreed," according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government is actively building new warships in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. In addition to the 26,000-ton battleship "Scharnhorst," which has already been completed, a 35,000-ton battleship is under construction. The late Admiral Tirpitz, the former Minister of the Navy, had planned to build a battleship named "Füdenburg," but it was suspended due to the end of the Great War before it could be completed. The battleship being built by the government this time will be comparable to the "Füdenburg." In addition, the government plans to build a 19,000-ton aircraft carrier and many large destroyers, but the tonnage of these destroyers has not been disclosed, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Press Fraternity</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The head of the Nazi Party's press group, Dietrich, has accepted the invitation of the Italian government and is scheduled to travel to Rome tonight with fifteen German journalists for several days to connect emotionally with the Italian press, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Enter the Western District of the Capital, 100,000 Troops Defend, Fires Rage in Many Parts of the City</h3>
<p>(London) The British Embassy in Madrid reported today that the Spanish Nationalist Army has crossed the Manzanares River and entered the Western Garden. At the same time, the government army's counter-offensive plan in the southern suburbs has been completed, and it is planned to thoroughly reorganize the current government, according to a National News Agency dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>(London) Although it is undeniable that the Spanish Nationalist Army has crossed the Manzanares River and entered Madrid, according to news received by officials here, the capital's garrison still has 100,000 men and will resist for a long time. It is said that the Spanish government is currently planning a thorough reorganization, planning to abolish the committee and still have officers in control, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Madrid: It is now confirmed that the enemy army has entered the capital. A Nationalist army unit, mostly Moorish soldiers, penetrated deep into the University City area, but failed to protect its communication lines, leading to a fierce counterattack by the government army. It is reported that they have now been completely surrounded, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>(London) A correspondent for the Spanish Nationalist Army telegraphed that a Nationalist army unit attacking the University City area in the northwest corner of Madrid has advanced, its direction of movement forming an angle with the main force of the Nationalist Army. Its right wing advanced along the outer wall of the former Royal Garden, where fierce battles have occurred several times. Although the government army counterattacked fiercely, the unit was still able to make considerable progress in the Western Garden and other places. Advancing along this route, the Nationalist Army can reach the center of the capital, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Madrid: Rebel planes attacked the capital three times today, dropping thirty to forty bombs on the city, mostly incendiary bombs. As a result, more than a dozen fires broke out in the city simultaneously. The Jerónimo Church, where the people gathered for refuge, also caught fire. Rebel planes continued to drop bombs everywhere in the evening. The government army's anti-aircraft guns were completely ineffective. Two bombs fell near the Prado Museum, and two prisoners and eight civilians were killed in the Modelo Prison, according to a National News Agency dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<p>Madrid: Last night, the city suffered the most terrible air raid since the outbreak of the civil war. In addition to many deaths and injuries, there was also extensive material damage. Enemy planes dropped highly explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in busy parts of the city, such as the Congress district, causing several stars, including the Provincial Hospital and the San Carlos Hospital, to catch fire simultaneously. The flames soared into the sky, turning the sky red. Residents were terrified by the sound of bomb explosions and anti-aircraft guns. When they began to go out to carry out rescue work, enemy planes launched a second attack, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Madrid: After the intense bombing by Nationalist army planes yesterday, many houses in several areas of the city were hit and caught fire, burning continuously throughout the night. Almost half of the houses on Vila Alba Street were destroyed. The French Embassy is located on this street, and the roof of the embassy was also blown off. One house next door and one house across the street were completely destroyed. In addition, the Madrid Provincial Hospital and the San Carlos Hospital are still burning. Fortunately, the patients and wounded in the hospitals had been moved to the French University on the recommendation of the French Embassy, avoiding the disaster. By two o'clock this morning, the Hotel Inglés near the hospital had also been affected. Although it is difficult to know the exact number of deaths and injuries so far, it must be very high, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Moroccan Troops Transfer Elite, Artillery Cover Repeated Assaults</h3>
<p>Madrid: Our correspondent Chardot reports that the fighting in the "French" Bridge area on the western outskirts of Madrid has been very fierce in the past two days. The Nationalist Army's strategy is to pass through the bridge, detour to the north of Madrid, and attack the city. Therefore, elite troops were drawn from the Moroccan indigenous army, using artillery cover to repeatedly attack the French Bridge. Yesterday afternoon, the Nationalist Army once approached the bridgehead, but was annihilated by the government army's artillery fire. The government army constantly bombed the enemy's positions last night and dismantled the bridge to prevent accidents. Until dawn today, the Nationalist Army attacked again, attempting to repair the bridge. The battle resumed at eight o'clock. The government army's positions were above the Nationalist Army, and they had a high commanding position. For the Nationalist Army, because there was no cover when advancing, the losses suffered were extremely heavy, and they were eventually defeated and retreated to the town of Alavaca near the Casa de Campo Park. As a result of this battle, the area around the French Bridge was greatly devastated, with many military and civilian casualties. The government army has continued to send reinforcements to strengthen the defenses there. Therefore, trucks, tanks, and armored vehicles transporting soldiers and ammunition are constantly on the road. In addition, anti-aircraft guns were set up at various strategic locations to prevent enemy planes from attacking, and many planes were sent to the Nationalist Army's positions to bomb them at ten o'clock this morning. At present, the general feeling is that the Nationalist Army will make a desperate attempt on the north side of Madrid. On the government army's side, discipline has been improved, and morale has been boosted. They have been ordered by their superiors to resolutely resist and not allow the Nationalist Army to occupy an inch of land. As for the town of Carabanchel on the south side of Madrid, the government army has made progress, and its positions have also been strengthened. General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Committee, is now stationed in Madrid, but is in constant communication with the commanders on the front line. Day and night, special personnel ride motorcycles back and forth between the front line and the Army Department to act as liaisons. The National Defense Committee has recently decided to hold regular meetings so that it can make decisive decisions when necessary and avoid delaying military opportunities. According to official sources, the National Defense Committee now has various defensive weapons, and the military situation is expected to gradually improve, according to a Havas dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<h3>France Recruits Thousands of Volunteers to Go to Spain to Join the Government Army</h3>
<p>Toulouse: Thousands of volunteers recruited from various parts of southern France set out from here today to join the Spanish government army. In order to counter this move, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army, has sent a Spanish priest to set up a recruiting office here, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Basque Army Participates in the War, Planes Bomb Rebels</h3>
<p>Bayonne: The government army of the Basque Country in northern Spain has been very active recently, as evidenced by the fact that its planes have repeatedly flown to Vitoria and Basauri to bomb railway lines. General Ugo Mendieta of the government army recently flew from Port Passages to the port of Bilbao and immediately took over command of the militias in the provinces along the Bay of Biscay, according to a Havas dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Spain: Situation of the Court Trial of the Son of the Former Dictator</h3>
<p>Alicante, Spain: José Antonio Primo de Rivera, the son of the late dictator General Rivera, who was the leader of the fascist Spanish Falange, was arrested for treason and inciting military rebellion. His brother Miguel and sister-in-law Margarita were also arrested. The People's Front Court here today brought José Antonio and the other two to trial. José Antonio, in his capacity as a lawyer, declared that he would defend himself and also defend his brother and sister-in-law. He admitted without hesitation to founding the Spanish Falange, but said that the association had merged with the youth group of the National Socialist Party, and its purpose was to promote syndicalism without any intention of restoring the monarchy. Although he had traveled to Germany before his arrest and held talks with the country's leader Hitler, it did not involve any political action, nor did he reach any agreement with the country's authorities. Miguel testified that he knew nothing about his brother José Antonio's political activities. After his brother was arrested, his wife had sent two pistols to his brother in prison, but this was not true. His wife, Margarita, also denied it, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Front Line</h3>
<p>Western Suburbs of Madrid: Our special correspondent Grant visited the front line on the outskirts of Madrid yesterday afternoon, from the Toledo Bridge in the south to Casa de Campo Park in the west. He personally saw the government army concentrate a large number of soldiers at the end of the Toledo Bridge, five kilometers from the Puerta del Sol in the center of Madrid, preparing to attack the Nationalist Army to the south. However, the Nationalist Army's positions were very solid and difficult to break through. At that time, there were three fires in Madrid. Looking through a telescope, the major streets were deserted, like a dead city. Grant then witnessed five Nationalist Army fighter planes and seven three-engine bombers bombarding the government army's positions in the town of Leganés in the southwest of Madrid. He saw more than a dozen bombs landing and exploding 200 meters from the old Royal Palace south of the University City area. Finally, Grant paid homage to the recent war marks near Casa de Campo Park, where he saw several small pillboxes that had been pierced by artillery fire. The bodies of war horses were scattered everywhere. The traces of tank tracks on the ground were clearly visible. Only a few small trees had not been destroyed by artillery fire and were still swaying in the wind. As for the "Cuatro Caminos" town and its airport on the south side of Madrid, they had been completely destroyed by artillery fire, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>War Reports from Both Sides</h3>
<p>Madrid: The National Defense Committee issued a war report at noon today, stating that the Moroccan indigenous army belonging to the rebels once advanced to the Philosophy College in the northwest suburb of the University City yesterday. The government army launched a counterattack on the left and right wings this morning, and the indigenous army units immediately collapsed and retreated to their original base. Another rebel unit had advanced to the Velázquez Institute in the University City area last night, but it had been surrounded by the government army. Until this morning, the government army launched a counterattack on all fronts and made progress. Rebel planes bombed the city yesterday, damaging four hospitals. The San Carlos Hospital had been hit and was burning, but fortunately the patients had been moved out in advance and were not affected. In addition, many houses were burned. Rebel planes also bombed the Unala district in the city twice this morning, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Seville: The Nationalist Army authorities here issued a broadcast message this morning, stating that the government army launched an offensive in the northwest suburb last night but failed. The Nationalist Army immediately repelled them and took advantage of the victory to advance, occupying the Velázquez Institute in the University City area. In total, the government army suffered more than 600 deaths. As for the Nationalist Army, there were many casualties. The government army's artillery and machine gun teams have been moved to the old Royal Palace and the Modelo Prison on the outskirts of the city. The Nationalist Army's artillery bombarded the "Cuatro Caminos" area in the city and the obstacles deployed by the government army, achieving considerable results. The government army is now releasing smoke screens to cover its positions to avoid reconnaissance by Nationalist Army planes. It is also reported that the Nationalist Army on the Siguenza front northeast of Madrid has captured many new positions near Robledo de Chavela. As for the gold stored in the Bank of Spain in Madrid, it has been gradually transported to Valencia. It is rumored that the last batch was escorted by Soviet tanks along the way. This statement has been confirmed, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>German Case of Arrested Overseas Chinese in Russia, Germany Protests for the Second Time, Rejected by Soviet Russia, Berlin Russians Do Not Take Rumors of the Severance of Relations between Germany and Russia Seriously</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Because the Soviet Russian authorities arrested a large number of overseas Chinese in Moscow's Leningrad, the German ambassador has lodged a protest with the Soviet Russian government. A total of twenty-two people were mentioned in the protest document. The Soviet Russian authorities have rejected this protest and only admitted to arresting fourteen overseas Chinese, including two women. They were all Russian military spies. German Ambassador Schulenburg is now hurriedly returning to Moscow from the Caucasus. According to the German Embassy in Moscow on November 12, a protest was lodged because it was learned that five overseas Chinese had been arrested. The current protest is the second protest, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<p>(Berlin) German-Russian relations are increasingly strained today due to Germany's serious protest against Soviet Russia's arrest of 23 Germans. Rumors are circulating here that Germany is now considering a retaliatory measure, according to a National News Agency dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the arrest of German nationals in the Soviet Union, a semi-official statement was recently issued, stating that the Soviet authorities informed the German Embassy in Moscow that a total of twenty-three German nationals had been arrested in the Soviet Union for engaging in espionage and terrorist activities and engaging in activities against the "Soviet Union." The charges are serious and German consuls are not allowed to visit them. "The German authorities believe that this accusation is completely unfounded, because the overseas Chinese have been arrested for ten days, and the Soviet authorities have not yet presented the specific facts of the alleged crime. The German government has lodged a protest once and will continue to maintain its protest," etc. At present, rumors are circulating in some quarters that Germany and Russia will sever diplomatic relations, but the Russians here do not attach much importance to such rumors. It is believed that after important German government officials made anti-Russian speeches at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September, all quarters also reported that German-Russian relations had not changed. Even on the German Army Memorial Day, the Soviet military attaché in Germany was still invited by General von Blomberg, Minister of Defense, to participate in the army parade. It can be seen that external rumors cannot be fully believed. As for the detailed charges against the arrested overseas Chinese, the Soviet authorities are preparing to notify Germany, according to a Havas dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<h3>French Powder Magazine Explosion Tragedy, Hundreds Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>Marseille: Two explosions occurred at the Saint-Chamas powder factory here today, killing 40 people and injuring more than 300. More than 100 of them are also unlikely to survive.

Prime Minister Daranyi, a representative of Regent Horthy, and other dignitaries went to the station to see him off. Regent Horthy is now scheduled to visit Italy in the middle of next week, and all the procedures have been planned. As is generally known, the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary have handled various important issues at the Vienna Conference in recent days. Therefore, the main significance of Ciano's visit this time is only to express the friendly relations between Hungary and Italy, and no agreement has been reached, according to a Havas dispatch on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Obstruct the British, British Parliament Discusses</h3>
<p>(London) At yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Earl Winterton asked Foreign Secretary Eden: "Foreigners, especially British subjects, who go to 'Manchukuo' and other places in Asia controlled by Japanese forces, are often obstructed or even treated indecently by Japanese police and customs authorities. Would it be helpful in practice if the British consuls in those places could warn British travelers in time to pay attention to themselves?" Foreign Secretary Eden replied, "Foreign merchants and travelers to Japan and neighboring areas are often subjected to such treatment, which is sufficient to have a negative impact. The British government has asked the Japanese government to pay attention to this matter. Apart from this, there is nothing I can say to you," according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Avenol Arrives in London</h3>

<h3>Situation of the Autumn Exercise of the 29th Army - Nearly 20,000 Officers and Soldiers from the North and South Armies - Song Zheyuan as Chief Supervisor Camping at Gu'an - Military and Political Figures and Students All Went to Observe</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The 29th Army of the Army held its autumn exercise this year, which began on the 11th of this month. During the exercise, there were camping, confrontation, pursuit, and other actions. Song Zheyuan left Peiping on the 13th to personally supervise the exercise site. It lasted four days and ended at about 3:00 PM on the 14th. Japanese military officers stationed in Peiping and Tianjin, important personnel of the Pacification Headquarters, and male and female students from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities all organized groups to go and observe. They returned to Peiping on the evening of the 14th. The details of the process are recorded below.</p>
<p>The deployment of the exercise troops was completed one day before the start. They were divided into two armies, the Blue (i.e., North) and the Red (i.e., South). The 37th Division of Feng Zhi'an's unit stationed in Nanyuan, with three infantry regiments plus a special service regiment (including cavalry, artillery, engineers, and transport), was formed into a mixed brigade, with Brigade Commander He Jili as the mixed brigade commander. Furthermore, the 132nd Division of Zhao Dengyu's unit stationed in Renqiu, with three infantry regiments plus a special service regiment, was organized into a mixed brigade, with Brigade Commander Shi Zhengang as the mixed brigade commander. The two armies had nearly 20,000 officers and soldiers. A general supervision department was also established, with Army Commander Song Zheyuan as the chief supervisor, and Division Commanders Feng Zhi'an and Zhao Dengyu as deputies. Zhang Weifan served as chief of staff and chief judge of the central court. The Northern Army and Southern Army each had a judge. Lin Kaijia, the head of the training regiment, served as the Northern Army judge, and Xu Tingyuan, the head of the education department, served as the Southern Army judge. On the afternoon of the 11th, the Northern and Southern armies mobilized at the same time. The Northern Army departed from Nanyuan and camped at Zhenguo Temple that night. The Southern Army arrived at Gu'an and camped. On the 12th, they advanced simultaneously and confronted each other in Panggezhuang. Chief of Staff Zhang Weifan, Deputy Chief Supervisors Feng Zhi'an and Zhao Dengyu all went from Peiping that morning to preside over the exercise. The two armies were deadlocked during the day, so they fought fiercely all night. The Southern Army was eventually forced too severely and could not withstand it at dawn on the 13th. It ordered a small part to resist, and most of the troops retreated. The Northern Army pursued vigorously and reached the vicinity of the Yongding River in the evening. They assembled in Yudai Town. The soldiers endured hardships and were very spirited. That night, the Northern Army used a small number of troops to feign a crossing at Shilipu as cover, while the majority crossed the Yongding River on a temporary pontoon bridge built by engineers at Xinzhuang. Starting at dawn on the 14th, they launched a general attack on the Southern Army. At this time, the main battle began. The sound of cannons roared, and the infantry also fired constantly with non-lead bullets. Red light illuminated the sky, and smoke filled the air, mixed with the sound of firecrackers. It could be heard for dozens of miles. After an hour, they crossed Gu'an. Chief Supervisor Zhu Zheyuan departed from Peiping on the morning of the 13th. Qin Dechun, Deng Zhexi, Chen Jiyan, Wang Shijiu, Yang Zhaogeng, Guo Zhihan, Men Zhizhong, and Liu Zhizhou followed to observe. They first gathered in Nanyuan. At 12:15, they continued to advance, passing through Huangcun, Panggezhuang, Liangjiawu, Xinzhuang, Shilipu, and other places. They got out of the car along the way to summon representatives of farmers and merchants, inquired about everything, and met with elementary school students. Representatives of merchants and villagers in various villages and towns along the way held small flags to welcome them. Song gave 50 or 100 yuan to the elementary school students depending on the number of students to purchase uniforms. In the afternoon, they arrived on the north bank of the Yongding River. Zhang Weifan, Feng Zhi'an, and Zhao Dengyu came to welcome them and accompanied them to Xinzhuang to visit the pontoon bridge built by the engineers. After half an hour, they continued to advance and camped at Gaozhuangtou, about five miles outside Gu'an City. There were a total of nine tents, set up in the woods of Gaozhuangtou. Before going to bed, the Chief Supervision Department prepared dinner, giving each person a package containing two steamed buns, one cornbread, a piece of pickled vegetables, half a pound of beef, and two eggs. Several buckets of boiling water were brought from Gu'an City for use. After dinner, Song and Liu Zhizhou went to inspect Gu'an City for a week, then returned to the tents. After gathering the personnel of the Chief Supervision Department to speak, they went to bed. Song lived alone in one tent. Zhang Weifan, Feng Zhi'an, Chen Jiyan, Zhang Yueting, and others shared a tent. Guo Zhihan, Zhao Dengyu, Liu Zhizhou, and others shared a tent. Deng Zhexi, Yang Zhaogeng, Wang Shijiu, and others shared a tent. They all slept on straw. Some only carried blankets, while others carried cotton quilts. It was cold at night, and those without quilts borrowed them from those who had them. It was a lot of fun. Although camping in the wild, it felt comfortable. Qin slept in the tent with his head in his hands. Someone said that the mayor was "drilling straw." Qin replied, "This is truly sleeping on firewood and tasting gall." Everyone got up at 6:00 AM on the 14th, dressed, and set off on horseback. At 7:40, they arrived at the position. At that time, the main battle was still continuing. After Song finished reading, he ordered a ceasefire. They turned back to Gaozhuangtou and gathered male and female students from Tsinghua, Yenching, and other schools to speak, saying, "Everyone has come with the army despite the hard work, which shows the spirit of enduring hardship, which I greatly admire. The Chinese nation has a great deal of inertia and is lagging behind in everything. If we can revitalize our spirit and work hard to become stronger, there will definitely be a way. I have no party or faction. I have been in the military since I was 20 years old until now. At first, because I only managed military affairs, I had no opportunity to meet with you. Now that I am also in charge of government affairs, I am also happy to talk with you. I have always advocated that anyone who discusses matters from the perspective of the interests of the country, society, and nation, I am extremely willing to accept humbly. If it is only for personal gain, I will definitely not get close to them. I adhere to this principle and am not afraid of any difficulties and oppression. I hope everyone will exercise your bodies, study hard, and be useful to the country in the future." At 12:10, all the officers and soldiers arrived at the designated location and lined up in a 口 shape. First, Song inspected it for a week. Then, judges Lin Kaijia, Xu Tingyuan, and Zhang Weifan spoke separately. Finally, Song gave a general commentary, which was completed in half an hour. He then gathered the officers and soldiers to speak and decided to have the representatives of the Beiping City Students' National Salvation Association present a large yellow satin flag with the words "Support the 29th Army to Defend North China". Tsinghua students also presented a pointed green flag with the words "National Pillar". After the presentation, the crowd shouted slogans, and the exercise came to an end. The soldiers began to demobilize on the 15th, and some of the observers also returned to the city. Song, Qin Dechun, Men Zhizhong, and others departed from Gu'an at about 3:00 PM on the 14th to inspect the officialdom and people's conditions in Renqiu, Hejian, Daming, and other places in southern Hebei, as well as the Pingda Highway. They will return to Peiping in three to five days. (14th)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Qingdao Municipal Agricultural Products Exhibition Hall - Simultaneously Holding an Agricultural Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Municipal Government allocated more than 10,000 yuan to improve agriculture and revitalize rural areas, ordering the Agricultural and Forestry Affairs Office to build an agricultural products exhibition hall in the Licun District, the agricultural center, so that farmers can learn from it and make improvements. The hall has been completed, and the opening ceremony was held on the 15th of this month. At the same time, an agricultural products competition was held, with a total of three days of exhibition from the 15th to the 17th. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Grand Opening: The Agricultural Products Exhibition Hall is built in the eastern half of the Licun Agricultural Experiment Field. The shape of the hall is 工-shaped. The venue is in front of the hall, with a platform made of reed mats, hanging with national flags. The four walls are covered with various interesting agricultural products and clear slogans that enlighten the people. Around 9:00 AM on the 15th, people from all walks of life arrived one after another, including Mayor Shen Honglie, Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, Jiaoji Railway Chairman Ge Guangting, Social Bureau Director Chu Zhen, Education Director Lei Fazhang, Observatory Director Jiang Bingran, Municipal Government Counselor Yang Jinsheng, Naval Office Director Li Yucheng, Municipal Party Headquarters Representative Li Xianliang, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Representatives Yu Weiting and Liu Wenting, Zhanjingtang, Shandong University President Lin Jiqing, as well as students from various schools, representatives from all walks of life, village chiefs, and more than 6,000 people. After the ceremony, the Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Affairs Office, Ge Jingying, reported on the preparations. The Mayor gave a speech, followed by Ge Guangting. The ceremony ended at 12:00, and visitors began to enter for a visit. On that day, more than 10,000 people visited.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Briefly stated, "Today is the opening of the Agricultural Products Exhibition, and we are very honored and grateful for everyone's presence. Our motivation for creating the Agricultural Products Exhibition Hall was at the very beginning of the Mayor's promotion of rural construction, which was after the Agricultural Products Exhibition two years ago. Because the improvement of agricultural affairs is really the basic work of rural construction, only with advanced agriculture can we obtain superior production and improve the economic situation of farmers. Naturally, it is easy to use their surplus manpower and financial resources to carry out all other construction undertakings; otherwise, if life is still difficult, the motivation to make progress will inevitably be weak, and nothing will be easy to promote. We have seen that this year's harvests in various places have been abundant, so the farmers' economy can be relatively affluent, and purchasing power can also increase, and the entire social economy is therefore active, especially easy to understand the importance of agricultural issues. Therefore, the greatest purpose of farmers is to increase production, but to increase production, we must apply scientific and technological techniques. Countries with advanced agriculture have various methods for improving agricultural affairs. In order to develop farmers' knowledge and improve agricultural technology, there is often a systematic demonstration, that is, collecting everything related to agriculture, such as tools, machines, etc., in one place, either for display or for competition, so that farmers can learn from each other and know how to imitate, and then agriculture can progress. Chicago in the United States, Brosser in Belgium, and Osaka in Japan all have similar agricultural products exhibition halls, agricultural reference halls, and agricultural products promotion halls. The purpose is roughly the same. In addition, specialized competitions and appraisals, such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, poultry, livestock, etc., are held anytime and anywhere, especially very common. Our office bears all the responsibilities for agriculture in Qingdao City. In order to enhance farmers' technical concepts and enlighten the public's agricultural knowledge, we have also held this small-scale exhibition hall. After a year of preparation, all the building construction, display furniture, and specimens were successively allocated 10,700 yuan by the Municipal Government. At the same time, many items were donated by agricultural institutions in various places and agricultural shops in this city, which added a lot of color to this hall. This is very grateful. However, even such a qualitative exhibition hall is small in scale. Within , it is a period , regarding all displays, planning, collection, arrangement, and these methods, it can be said to be another kind of door knowledge. We are inevitable in , placement, and there are places that do not fit the style, we want everyone to forgive, and , the performance of various systems, is not easy, it is not possible to do perfectly with a small amount of money and a very short time. In the future, we will of course do our best to supplement and improve. I hope that people from all walks of life can give instructions at any time. This time, to commemorate the opening, we will also hold an agricultural products competition. Many farmers from various villages participated, and we can know that the farmers have a considerable understanding of the competition and interest, which makes us very gratified. In the future, we will often do various competitions in different categories, just like modern countries with advanced agriculture. I believe that farmers can get a deeper impression, and can have a good impact on the improvement of agricultural technology and the increase of agricultural production. This will not fail the purpose of promoting rural construction in this city."</p>

<h3>Tragedy of a Fisherman Killed in Nanhui</h3>
<p>Fisherman Wang Longkui (27 years old), a fisherman from Binhai Township in the Second District, was netting fish on the beach at the boundary between the Fifth and Sixth Regiments at about 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month. At that time, Han Jingzhou, the deputy captain of the Zhuqiao Merchant Patrol Team, led more than ten salt police officers to patrol the beach. The captain saw that the net had caught nine sea bass (worth three yuan) and took them away for one yuan. Longkui refused, causing a conflict. Then Longkui was dragged away, claiming that he would be sent to the authorities. Xiao Niu and Zhang Alan, who were fishing with him, tried to rescue him, but they were shot and let go to be arrested. After Longkui was arrested, there was no news of him. His wife, Jin, asked someone to visit the team headquarters in Minhang Zhenru and other places, but she did not get the truth. On the afternoon of the 9th, on the beach about a mile north of the incident site, someone found a floating ball cap, containing a piece of white cloth. Jin went to identify it and confirmed that it was her husband's hat. Looking closely, there was a bullet hole through the hat, and she guessed that her husband had been shot. However, she was still skeptical. On the 11th, Longkui's body was scooped up by fisherman Mao Fufu in his net at the north entrance of Panjia Hong in the Fifth Regiment. He reported it to her. When she went to see it, there were inspection marks on his head, and an iron anchor was tied to his back, showing that he was deliberately drowned to destroy the evidence. The incident was reported by him to the Zhuqiao Public Security Fourth Substation, which reported it to the county government for inspection, to arrest the murderer, and to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: Huge Number of Silver Coins Seized at Zhenze Station</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenze Town bus station in this county seized 3,000 yuan in hard currency that Chen Guozhu of the Shanghai Liyuan Money Shop had collected from Yanmu Town in this county, preparing to transport them to Suzhou and then to Shanghai. The police at the station found it during a search and sent it to the branch bureau, which transferred it to the county. The county government has now presented it to the province for instructions so that it can be dealt with.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Comforting the Patriotic Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, in view of the opening of the war in Suidong and Subei, and the hard work of the soldiers at the front for the country, telegraphed Chuan Zuoyi on the 17th to express condolences and asked the government authorities to provide substantial assistance. The Wuxian Journalists Association also organized donations to comfort the patriotic soldiers on the tenth day, informed all members of the provincial and municipal press circles of the condolences, and prepared to donate money, and then presented it to the party organs and organizations to comfort the patriotic soldiers.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Silk Factory Buys Children to Sacrifice to the Chimney</h3>
<p>In Xintangqiao Township near Tingzhen Town in the Second District of the county, silk merchant Bao and others recently raised funds to initiate the construction of a small silk factory, installing 120 silk carriages. All the houses have been completed, but Bao and others are superstitious and must hold a big sacrifice to the chimney after the factory is completed. Before the event, they bought a child from someone surnamed XX, raised him in the factory, and gave him meat every day, preparing him for the sacrifice to the chimney. This cruel and inhumane act is deeply hoped to be stopped by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Youth Hits Train and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongsheng, a shop assistant at Hengyuanxing Leather Shoe Store on Wuyi Avenue, liked women and often frequented brothels. He also had an affair with a female worker from a factory. Because he did not have enough money to spend, he was heavily in debt and sold goods from the store privately, which caused him to be dismissed by the shop owner. Rongsheng was stimulated by this, and the female worker treated him as a stranger. On the evening of the 15th, he sneaked to Zhangjia Village, Mingshan Town, outside Dongdou, and stayed overnight. At about 9:00 PM, when an incoming train arrived, Rongsheng suddenly had a suicidal thought and ran to the railway and hit his head hard against the train. Immediately, blood spurted out and he fell to the ground and died. The scene was extremely tragic. Afterwards, his uncle, Feng Yuan, and the town police reported to the local court on the 16th, requesting an exemption from inspection, which was approved to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Director Ye Inspects and Returns to the Bureau</h3>
<p>Cai Hongxu, director of the Second Shatianyuan Bureau of Jiangsu Province, has been in office for more than two months. In order to understand the various cases and urge the collection of Chengtian compensation, he requested approval from the Finance Department in the middle of last month and took the personnel of the Surveying and Measurement Section to inspect six counties under the direct jurisdiction of the bureau, including Nantong, Rugao, Jiangyin, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Wujin. He returned to the bureau the day before yesterday. He has concrete measures for sorting out the various cases. It is reported that the accumulated Chengtian compensation for river cases in various counties is very large, and there are also many hidden and overflowing fields. The director believes that the arrears and concealment will affect the treasury revenue. For this reason, he has specially appointed Chen Weiqing, Zhu Shaoqing, and Su Ruxiang as resident staff in Jiangyin, Taixing, and Wujin, and ordered Jin Minjun, a member of the General Affairs Section of the Bureau, and the first and second offices to effectively check and squeeze out the overflowing fields, and set a deadline for the collection of Chengtian compensation from each Shatian household. If they fail to pay after the deadline, they will be punished according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Shuangqiao Crackdown</h3>
<p>The bandit atmosphere in the northern rural districts is extremely rampant. After suppression by the security team, a bandit den was cracked down upon in Shuangqiao Town, and bandit Zhu Bailin, as well as female bandits Feng Di's, Liu Wang's, etc., were captured. On the 16th, they were escorted to the Fourth District Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Head Bridge Fire Burns Nine Homes</h3>
<p>At the home of Zhu Hugui, a resident of the 7th Bao, 10th Jia of Zhu Xiaozhuang, Touqiao, 3rd District of Jiangdu, a fire alarm suddenly occurred yesterday (the 15th) around 8 PM. At that time, the wind was fierce and the fire was raging. By the time the water dragons rushed to the scene, the fire had already spread to neighboring houses. Zhu was sick in bed, and there was still a coffin containing the body of Zhu's brother in the house. After rescue by the crowd, Zhu was burned, and the bones in the coffin were also charred. In total, nine homes were burned down, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Arrest of a Large Number of Bandits</h3>
<p>Robberies in the rural areas of Jiaxing are frequently reported. The authorities have ordered investigations to ensure arrests are made. Recently, a member of the investigation team, Ren Chang, learned that the robberies occurring in Yuxian Town, a county under its jurisdiction, were all committed by bandits from the Shui Huo gang. Therefore, the leader of the investigation team, Shen Jianfei, dispatched Detective Li Zhankui, along with detectives Xu Baorong and others, to search near the Three Pagodas outside the West Gate. They seized four Jiangbei boats and arrested ten bandits, including Xue, Chen Xiaodaizi, Yao Xiaojiu Zi, Pan Dezi, Liu Xiao, Xiao Long, Xu Xiaowu Zi, Wang Youcai, Zhang Ada, Sun Lingqi, and Zhou Liu, along with a significant amount of stolen goods such as rice and miscellaneous items. After taking them in for questioning, the bandits confessed that they were all from Jiangbei and admitted to committing robberies in collusion. They also confessed to robbing Ge Jinshan's Pinghu sailing ship at Jishanmen Bridge and committing multiple robberies at the South Gate and other places. The bandits will now be escorted to the district command for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Human Trafficking</h3>
<p>According to reports from the Jiaxing investigation agencies, there are more than seventy human trafficking organizations in Jiaxing. However, these individuals are very powerful, making it difficult to crack down on them. Recently, Lao Er, the wife of Xue Pei of Dingjia Bridge North on Beixiatang Street, attempted to deceive and sell Ah Mei, a young maid from the Zhenchang Photo Studio, and Ah Wen, a maid from Feng Changnian's home, to Shanghai. Ah Wen has already been reported missing. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that Lao Er was the mastermind. Therefore, negotiations were initiated with her while also notifying the investigation team to take immediate action.</p>
<h3>This Week —Social Aspects—</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>(I) Disaster Relief Movement</p>
<p>The former capital, Beiping, is located near the northern frontier. Every winter, icy winds blow in from Mongolia, and in an instant, the temperature drops sharply from forty or fifty degrees to below freezing. This sudden change often leaves the poor and thinly clad helpless. After the Beginning of Winter on November 6th this year, cold winds blew continuously from the north for three days and nights, causing the yellow leaves on the branches to fall almost completely, the dust on the ground to be swept away, and the temperature to drop to that of severe winter. Taking only the 6th and 7th as examples, there are verifiable records of up to ten people freezing to death on the streets, including nine men and one woman, with six of them being young adults. On the 10th, another seven cases were discovered, including four young adult men. The severity of the impact of the cold on these poor people is evident. It is feared that there are at least tens of thousands of people struggling with death in the cold throughout the city. This is the cold disaster. What is even more serious, of course, is the famine. In the four suburbs of Beiping, the harvest of crops has been greatly reduced in both spring and autumn this year due to scarce rainfall. Even in normal years of good harvest, these people often face food shortages. In this year of famine, these more than ten thousand farmers have all turned into disaster victims, eating tree leaves and grass roots to survive. In addition, since the large-scale military exercises by the Japanese army since the 26th of last month, in addition to several cases of stray bullets causing instant death, hundreds of families have been displaced and have no homes to return to. Furthermore, the trampling of wheat fields and the ravaging of vegetable gardens are not uncommon. Amidst this widespread famine, more than ten thousand disaster victims are directly affected. In addition, there are also a considerable number of unemployed intellectuals and descendants of the Manchus. According to statistics, there are a shocking number of disaster victims in Beiping, both in the city and in the suburbs, struggling with cold and famine. If relief is not provided soon, it will pose a great threat to social order. Therefore, since this week, the disaster relief movement has been launched with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The first to advocate for the disaster relief movement were people in the local media and various charitable organizations, as well as local authorities such as Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and the 29th Army, who also provided strong support. Up to now, in addition to the various newspapers having successively reported on and solicited donations, people in the press have also scheduled two nights of voluntary performances at the Huale Theater on the 15th and 16th, with ticket prices ranging from two yuan to two jiao. All proceeds will be used to donate to disaster victims. In terms of performers, in addition to a few hired famous actors, most of them are reporters, editors, columnists, presidents, managers, and their wives, who personally perform to plead for the disaster victims. It is estimated that several thousand yuan can be raised. Charitable organizations such as the National Relief Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the International Women's Benevolent Association, the Salvation Army, the Red Swastika Society, the Blue Swastika Society, the Poor People's Relief Association, the Buddhist Association, and the Wutai Mountain Puji Buddhist Association have also successively engaged in relief efforts. They have also formed a joint charitable organization to conduct on-site investigations, fundraising, and relief distribution. Mayor Qin Dechun ordered the Finance Bureau on the 10th to allocate 20,000 yuan to the Joint Charity Association for disaster relief purposes. As of now, there are a total of twenty-one porridge kitchens established throughout the city, with more than ten others in preparation, as well as several warm shelters specifically for the homeless. Other efforts, such as distributing rice and clothing, are also being actively carried out.</p>
<p>(II) Anti-Drug Campaign</p>
<p>The deep extent of drug use in Beiping due to its special environment has long been a concern of insightful people. The trend of it deepening day by day this year is undoubtedly obvious. Although severe punishments and even capital punishment are frequently imposed, and there is hardly a day without the shooting of drug offenders, the extent of drug use has not been significantly reduced. Starting from the Double Tenth Festival this year, the authorities launched a large-scale anti-drug campaign, expanding publicity, posting slogans and pictures in the main streets, and distributing leaflets, almost door to door, with earnest advice. At the same time, it was announced that starting from January 1 next year, anyone who smokes, sells, or manufactures highly addictive drugs such as heroin and morphine will be executed upon capture, regardless of whether they are first-time offenders or repeat offenders. It was also announced that there are about 150,000 highly addictive drug offenders in the city. Starting next year, between 3,000 and 9,000 of them will be executed first, and then the effects will be observed. Since October, drug rehabilitation centers have been greatly expanded, and police officers have been dispatched by the Public Security Bureau to arrest drug offenders. According to statistics, more than a thousand people have been rehabilitated. When we walk through the streets, we often see dozens of gaunt men and women tied together in a string by police officers, wearing extremely thin clothes and shivering in the cold wind. These are the highly addictive drug offenders. However, since the anti-drug campaign was launched, more than a month has passed, and there are only forty or fifty days left until January 1 next year. As of now, the implementation of the anti-drug campaign cannot be said to be completely without results. However, the manufacturing and trafficking of highly addictive drugs is under the protection or handling of certain foreigners and Koreans, and local authorities have no way to intervene. Moreover, those who consume highly addictive drugs such as heroin are different from opium, and most of them are very difficult to quit. Drug rehabilitation centers, due to financial constraints, are certainly unable to accommodate this huge number of drug offenders, and even in terms of rehabilitation methods, it is difficult to completely eradicate the addiction. After leaving the center, relapse is inevitable. Given these practical reasons, in order for the anti-drug campaign to be effective, effective remedies must be found for these various reasons. On the 10th of this month, the Beiping Municipal Government held a public burning of highly addictive drugs at the fire station of the Public Security Bureau on Gong'an Street. What was burned were various highly addictive drugs from 684 cases of highly addictive drugs seized from July 23rd to February 25th, weighing a total of 893 taels, 3 qian, and 7 fen (approximately 33.3 kg) of heroin and morphine, including the skin, as well as 2,972 small packets; 453 taels of Jindan, including the skin, as well as two small packets; 1,221 taels, 8 qian, and 9 fen (approximately 45.4 kg) of heroin ingredients and opium dross, as well as 194 small packets; 52 taels of high root; 4 taels and 7 fen and 8 li of Xian Gaona, including the skin; 3,917 taels and 7 li (approximately 146 kg) of anesthetic, including the skin, as well as 60 small packets; 224 taels and 6 fen of lactose, including the skin, as well as two and a half bags and 22 small packets; 72 taels of Quick Zhong Kuai, including the skin; 19 taels and 8 qian of coffee essence, including the skin, as well as 13 boxes and 10 small packets; 40 jin (approximately 20 kg) of similar coffee essence, including the skin; 88 taels of machine-made opium pipes adulterated with highly addictive substances, including the skin; 44 taels of opium essence; 12 taels of red pills, including the skin, as well as 57 pills. The quantity was large and the variety was diverse, which was astounding. When it was burned, the stench permeated everywhere and lingered for a long time.</p>
<p>The authorities have the greatest determination to promote the anti-drug campaign, but according to surveys, most of those who consume highly addictive drugs such as heroin are still hesitant and unwilling to voluntarily enter rehabilitation centers because it is not easy to quit. Even in the face of extreme punishment, most of them are resigned to their fate. Therefore, for the sake of humanitarianism and for the thorough implementation of the national anti-drug policy, the search for effective methods to quit highly addictive drugs is currently the most important task.

<h3>A Giant of a Tennis Generation: Tilden Boils Wine and Discusses Heroes; Highly Praises Germany's Cramm; Arrived in Hong Kong on the 9th for Performances, Departing for the Philippines on the 10th</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Special Dispatch: Tilden, who has devoted his life to tennis, and Vines, who holds the throne of professional tennis, were invited by the Yomiuri Shimbun of Japan to Japan to perform their lifelong skills. They competed in Japan seven times and were very popular due to their superb skills. After the performances, they took the President Lincoln steamer to Shanghai, China. They held singles and doubles performances in Shanghai on the 6th. Due to time constraints, they took the original steamer south on the 7th. They arrived in Hong Kong at 10 AM on the 9th. The Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Association sent representatives to the port to welcome them. The two and Mrs. Vines then stayed at the Hong Kong Hotel. Female professional tennis player Miss Harbert did not come due to illness. After Tilden and Vines rested, they held their first singles performance at the Hong Kong Cricket Club lawn in the afternoon at 4 PM. They adopted a best-of-three-sets system. As a result, Vines won in straight sets with a score of 14-12, 6-3. At 6:30 PM, Tilden gave a public relations speech on the rooftop of the Grand Hotel. At 8:30 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by the Lawn Tennis Association and lectured on tennis methods (Li Huitang recorded his lecture and published it in the newspaper on the 14th). At 3:30 PM on the 10th, he held a second singles performance at the Cricket Club, adopting a best-of-five-sets system. Tickets were priced at $3.50 and $2.50. The lively scene was undoubtedly better than yesterday. Important figures from all walks of life in Hong Kong attended the event. As a result of the match, Vines won 3-1 with scores of 10-8, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. That evening at 6 PM, Tilden and Mr. and Mrs. Vines took the original ship to Manila for performances. They are scheduled to stay in Hong Kong for two days on their return trip, where they will continue their performances before returning to their home country via Shanghai. During this visit to Hong Kong, Tilden gave a speech discussing the current world tennis situation, which is recorded below.</p>
<p>Eastern Tour Audiences Break Unprecedented Records</p>
<p>When the reporter met with Mr. Tilden on board the ship upon his arrival in Hong Kong, Mr. Tilden told the reporter that in next year's Davis Cup, England will be short of Perry's assistance, and Germany or the United States may have hopes of winning the title. German first-hand Cramm has a great chance of winning the Wimbledon championship. World number one tennis player Pan Jie has turned professional. It is believed and has been signed, but I do not know the contents of the contract. Regarding our trip to the East, when we arrived in Japan, the number of spectators reached 40,000, breaking all previous records. In Shanghai alone, the audience exceeded 3,000 people.</p>
<p>Frenchman Cochet Often Has Good Works Recently</p>
<p>This is the first time to travel to the Far East with Mr. and Mrs. Vines, and the impressions along the way are very good. We are scheduled to perform in Manila. Tickets for the stadium are said to be sold out. There are rumors that we will travel to South Africa, but this is not true. We have a contract in the United States and must return home on schedule. American Davis Cup representatives such as doubles stars Smith and Lott have achieved great results since turning professional and fighting across the United States. Recently, I traveled to England with Mr. Smith and won the professional doubles championship. Frenchman Cochet, who is the most eye-catching, often has good works recently. In the Wimbledon competition in May next year, he will become a strong enemy of all the famous players.</p>
<p>Australian Famous Players Are Still in the Budding Stage</p>
<p>Regarding famous players from various countries, I saw American famous player Budge perform at the US Open and found him to be quite capable. I am afraid he is no match for German Cramm. According to my observation, in this year's Wimbledon, if Cramm had not injured his foot, he could have defeated Perry. Regarding next year's Davis Cup, Australia can only fight to the North American zone final. American Budge may easily defeat the top two players in Australia. Although Quist is one of the famous players, he is not enough to compete with other players at most. Australian famous players are still in the budding stage.</p>
<p>Germany Is Very Talented and Plays a Good Ball</p>
<p>Crawford has become an old beauty, but McGrath is quite capable and plays a good ball. You can see this when she and the United States competed in the Davis Cup. Germany is very strong. Although it only relies on Cramm and the two, if they are absolutely free of problems, they can win the championship for Germany. Australia cannot compete with them. I highly recommend Grand, who has always been ambitious, but unfortunately cannot become a good tennis player. He did not perform well in the Davis Cup. American youth Handris cannot be promised as a Davis Cup representative, but his strength lies in continuing to participate in various球賽.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marble Can Be Compared to Mrs. Matty</p>
<p>Among women, although Marvel has never won the US championship, she has been practicing hard and has now become as charming as Mrs. Matty. Regarding the collection of professional players into a professional arena, this is absolutely impossible. The world has been spreading rumors, which has become a popular saying. I would like to take this opportunity to correct it. All members have their own contracts and do not belong to any group. There is no basis for this. I would like to solemnly declare that I have no relationship with Cobb. This trip to the East is purely planned by myself and Mr. Vines with various places.</p>
<p>Professional Players Are Difficult for Amateurs to Beat</p>
<p>Every time a professional player comes out to compete, they must show their lifelong skills to satisfy the audience. Unfortunately, the general absurd theories of wrestling and boxing often have a negative impact on professional tennis. This is an absurd theory. Furthermore, it is impossible for all good players to show their best in one or every game. This can be seen in the world's top players. Just take Pan Lai as an example. How often have you seen him show his full potential except in important competitions? The same is true for amateur players. As for comparing professional first-class players with amateur first-class players, according to my observation, Naslin of Germany and Vines of the United States can solve Pan Lai.</p>
<h3>West Qing Basketball: Three Teams Must Be Tested</h3>
<p>The Bee Team Goes South to Datong; Trial Match Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>As a result of the registration for the West Qing Basketball League, a total of twenty-six teams participated. The list has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the league will test the strength of the "Wasp" team and the Southern Advance team, which are designated to join the Independent Group, and the Datong team of the University Group, as their strengths are currently unknown. It is questionable whether they can compete in the level designated for them. The three teams are specially asked to hold a trial match at the West Qing Basketball Gym at 8:00 PM tomorrow (Thursday) to test whether they meet the standards, so as to promote or demote them. Also, because there are too many participants, their results must be reviewed, and one or two teams may need to be eliminated. As for the grouping issue, there may be no major changes. A notice has been issued by the league yesterday morning regarding the earlier start of the game, seeking the consent of each team, and it is expected to be approved.</p>
<h3>Student Tennis: Li Guofan vs. Tang Baojia Today; The Outcome Is Related to the Championship</h3>
<p>The student hard court tennis championship hosted by the East China Sports Equipment Company has entered its round-robin week and has already completed five matches. Currently, except for Cai Guoji, who has lost all three matches and has been determined to be fourth place, Li Guofan has won both of his two matches and has the best form with two points. Although Ye Baosheng has the same score as Li, he has already completed all three matches, with two wins and one loss. Tang Baojia has one win and one loss, with one point. There is still one match between Tang Baojia and Li Guofan, and the outcome is extremely important. If Tang wins and Li loses, then Tang, Li, and Ye will all have two wins and one loss, with the same score. If Li wins Tang, then everything will be resolved smoothly, and the champion and runner-up can be determined accordingly. Therefore, if Tang can bravely go all out, he has the power to turn things around. The two have scheduled to face each other at the Kangdi Club court at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and it is predicted that there will be an exciting situation. The current situation of the four is listed below.</p>

<h3>Order from the Bureau of Education: Elementary School Teachers Must Not Resign Mid-Term; Unauthorized Departure Will Result in Orders to Return to School</h3>
<p>The Kiangsu Provincial Bureau of Education considers elementary school teachers to be direct guides in nurturing children and indirectly responsible for the mission of national revival. Their responsibility is extremely important. All elementary school teachers should fulfill their duties and possess a spirit of sacrifice, seeking the welfare of children and the nation. Recently, many elementary school teachers have been able to settle into their jobs and work diligently, but those who are opportunistic and seek personal gain still inevitably exist. The Bureau has repeatedly received reports from various districts that some elementary school teachers, after being hired, have left their posts mid-term without proper arrangements or replacements, seeking better positions elsewhere. This not only harms their professional responsibility but also greatly affects children's studies, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, the Bureau specifically instructed all counties yesterday to follow Article 70 of the revised Elementary School Regulations: in the future, if elementary school teachers in this province who have accepted a position at a school wish to resign mid-term, they must obtain the principal's consent and ensure that someone is hired to replace them before leaving the school. Resignation is only permitted in cases of severe illness preventing service or significant matters requiring departure. If these regulations are not followed and teachers leave mid-term without regard for their contracts, the original school should notify the new employer to order the teacher to return to school. The new employer, upon confirming that the teacher resigned mid-term, must not readily employ them. If the teacher is employed in another province, the case should be reported to this Bureau, which will forward a letter ordering them to return to their post. This restriction aims to encourage the spirit of service among elementary school teachers, increase elementary school efficiency, and emphasize children's studies. All elementary school teachers should understand this intention and abide by it together, avoiding violations or overstepping boundaries that would bring blame upon themselves.</p>
<h3>Various Schools Donate Funds to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Minli Middle School: The entire student body of Minli Middle School, due to the recent invasion of Suiyuan by puppet bandits and the impending crisis, and the courageous defense by our loyal soldiers, responded to the declaration issued by students in Peiping and Tientsin yesterday (the 17th) by launching a fundraising campaign. It is reported that each student pledged to donate three dollars, and other donations were also significant. With over 1,500 students, the total amount collected should be considerable.</p>
<p>Qingnian Middle School: Qingfei Road, Qingnian Middle School, recently, due to the enemy's intense desire to invade us, and the puppet bandits' incursions, the battle in northern Suiyuan has already broken out. Frontline soldiers are shedding blood and fighting fiercely in the icy and snowy conditions to defend our territory. All Chinese people should fulfill their national duty and provide substantial assistance to the soldiers who are loyally defending the country. This past Monday, the school held the 12th weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen, during which Principal Guo Jiwu delivered a motivational speech, urging all teachers and students to enthusiastically contribute. The entire faculty and students were deeply moved and actively donated. It is reported that once the school has collected a considerable amount, it will be handed over to the government for forwarding to the front lines to慰劳the troops. The school also suggests that the government, after receiving donations from various schools and forwarding them to the front lines, issue receipts to each school for record-keeping and public announcement, to inspire encouragement and demonstrate great trust.</p>
<p>Weiyu Elementary School: The entire faculty, students, and staff of the private Weiyu Elementary School in the French Concession of this city, deeply admired the soldiers in Suiyuan for resisting the enemy. During the memorial week, the students spontaneously initiated a donation drive, with each person donating two jiao. A first-grade student, Zhang Pingzhi, even donated one yuan saved from his snack money. The school staff was also moved, each donating between five fen and one jiao, totaling ninety-three yuan, forty-five fen. On the spot, they elected representatives to draft a letter and send it by airmail to General Fu Zuoyi. Although written by young children, the words were extremely sorrowful and sincere.</p>
<h3>Three Members of the Ministry of Education, Chung, Tang, and Chou, Depart for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanking, 17th, Central News Agency) The supervisors Chung Tao-tsan and Tang Hsi-fen, dispatched by the Ministry of Education to inspect education in Kwangtung and Kwangsi, departed on the 17th. Supervisor Chou Pang-tao, assigned to inspect education in Shensi, is scheduled to depart on the 18th. Each inspection period is estimated to be one month.</p>
<h3>Chinese Economic Society: Ma Yin-chu Appointed President</h3>
<p>The Chinese Economic Society held its annual meeting in this city in late September. After electing the new board of directors, all outgoing officers began the work of completing their duties in preparation for the handover. Recently, the society held a joint meeting of the outgoing and incoming boards at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club, where they elected the new president. As a result, Ma Yin-chu and Zhou Zuomin were elected as president and vice president. Additionally, as Director Yang Yinpu was going abroad, Alternate Director Mu Ouchu was appointed to fill the vacancy. Furthermore, Liu Dajun, Tang Qingzeng, and Dong Xiujia were appointed as reviewers for the society's essay competition, and several permanent members were approved. Previously, Mr. Ma Yin-chu had served as the society's president for seven consecutive years. He stepped down to rest due to new regulations, and then served as the society's vice president in the previous term. This time, he has been re-elected as president, and with his familiarity and skill, he will surely make even greater contributions to the society. It is reported that he will take office within a week, and the society's mailing address will then be changed to the Legislative Yuan in Nanking.</p>
<h3>The Boy Scout Community in This City Implements a One-Day Fundraiser</h3>
<p>Donations Have Reached 400-500 Yuan</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Council in this city previously led the city's Boy Scout community in a one-day fundraising event to raise funds for purchasing aircraft, raising over 300 yuan. It was reported in the previous issue. We have now learned that the council has further received 30 yuan and 7 jiao from the City Chamber of Commerce, 1 yuan and 1 jiao from the Xiangxue Troupe, 1 yuan and 8 jiao from the Lida Troupe, 5 yuan from the Provincial Shangzhong School, 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen from the Jingan Troupe, 8 jiao 4 fen and 3 li from the Lisheng Troupe, 4 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen and 3 li from the Dazhong Troupe, 44 yuan 3 jiao and 1 fen from the Minsheng Troupe, 4 yuan 2 jiao and 5 fen from the Zhengxiu First Elementary School Troupe, 1 yuan 3 jiao and 7 fen from the Jinrong Troupe, 2 jiao and 1 fen from the Renyi Troupe, 5 jiao from the Zhongfa Troupe, 1 yuan from the Daozhong Troupe, and 1 yuan from service staff Tang Jicheng, totaling approximately 99 yuan. Including the previous amount, a total of 400-500 yuan has been collected. It is also reported that many troops and service staff have not yet submitted their donations to the council, so it has not been possible to conclude the event temporarily.</p>
<h3>Speech Contest Dates for Various Universities in East China</h3>
<p>The 12th and 13th of Next Month / Tongji University Approved to Participate in the Competition</p>

Last week, a plenary meeting was held in Nanking, gathering student representatives from Kwang Hua, Fudan, Jiaotong, Jinan, Soochow, and Ginling universities to discuss the progress of the association's affairs.

<h3>Measures for Subsidizing Northeastern Youth in Scientific Research</h3>
<p>The Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education, concerned that Northeastern graduates from specialized schools and above who are engaged in scientific research at universities or research institutions both domestically and abroad often face financial difficulties, which leads to interruptions in their research, has established 20 scientific research subsidies to encourage and assist them. There are three categories: five Category A subsidies, each worth 600 yuan per year; five Category B subsidies, each worth 480 yuan per year; and ten Category C subsidies, each worth 360 yuan per year. Any graduate from a specialized school or above who is registered in the Northeast and is currently engaged in scientific research (limited to natural sciences, applied sciences, and social sciences) at a university or research institution domestically or abroad, has achieved significant results, and does not hold any paid position may apply for a subsidy. (Application forms and regulations have been distributed to various schools and embassies, but the office has printed more copies for request.) Furthermore, as the 23rd year has already begun for several months, the office has presented and received approval to issue half of the annual subsidy to each student for this year. A copy of the office's approved regulations for scientific research subsidies is provided below.</p>
<p>Regulations for Scientific Research Subsidies of the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office (Article 1) The Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office (hereinafter referred to as "this Office") establishes scientific research subsidies to encourage and assist Northeastern graduates from specialized schools and above who are engaged in scientific research at universities or research institutions both domestically and abroad. (Article 2) The annual scientific research subsidies mentioned in the previous article are provisionally set at 9,000 yuan. The types, number of awards, and amounts are as follows: (Category A) five awards, each worth 600 yuan per year; (Category B) five awards, each worth 480 yuan per year; (Category C) ten awards, each worth 360 yuan per year. The subsidy period is limited to one academic year (from August of each year to July of the following year). Upon expiration, a new application must be submitted following the prescribed procedures. (Article 3) Any graduate from a specialized school or above who is registered in the provinces and cities of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin, and is currently engaged in scientific research (natural sciences, applied sciences, and social sciences) at a university or research institution domestically or abroad, has achieved significant results, and does not hold any paid position may, at the beginning of each academic year, fill out an application form (printed by this Office) and submit it along with the original diploma, academic transcripts (students studying abroad may ask their schools to send them directly to this Office), current research or course transcripts, and a recommendation letter from their supervisor or advisor to this Office for review. However, publicly funded students sent abroad by this Office and students currently studying at universities or research institutes domestically who have already been recommended by their schools in accordance with this Office's regulations for subsidizing Northeastern diligent and impoverished students may not apply for a subsidy. (Article 4) After receiving the applications and other documents from the students, this Office will organize a review committee to conduct a thorough review and decide on the granting of subsidies based on their research achievements and economic situation. If the number of qualified applicants exceeds the number of awards stipulated in Article 2, the awards should be distributed to those with the best academic performance and the most dire economic circumstances. The members of the aforementioned review committee are provisionally set at three to seven, appointed by this Office, with the director and deputy director of this Office serving as ex officio members. (Article 5) In order to review the research achievements of each student, this Office may send personnel or entrust related organizations to conduct investigations. (Article 6) Each student who passes the review must submit their application to the Ministry of Education for approval before the subsidy is issued. If the aforementioned qualified students have already received public funding, scholarships, financial aid, or other subsidies, the review committee should appropriately reduce their subsidy amount before issuing it. (Article 7) Each subsidized student shall abide by the regulations of this Office for managing and assisting students, as well as other relevant regulations and orders. If any of the circumstances listed in item 9 of the Provisional Measures for the Relief of Northeastern Diligent and Impoverished Students occur, their subsidized status shall be immediately revoked, and in more serious cases, the subsidies already received shall be recovered. (Article 8) These regulations shall take effect from the date of approval. Matters not covered herein may be amended at any time.</p>

<h3>American Reporter Arrives in Shanghai from Japan and Discusses Maturation of the Japanese-German Alliance - Japanese Side to Submit for Deliberation by the Privy Council Soon - Hoping for Other Countries to Participate - German Consul-General Still Denies</h3>
<p>The long-rumored Japanese-German alliance was denied earlier this month by the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, when he passed through Shanghai on his return to his post from vacation in Japan. However, yesterday's English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that Mr. Paul Patterson, editor of the Baltimore Sun, arrived in Shanghai by ship from Japan the day before yesterday afternoon and told the press that Japan had reached an agreement with Germany on an alliance two weeks ago. His words were assertive, suggesting that it was indeed the case.</p>
<p>German Consul-General Still Denies - A reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically visited the German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, last night. Despite the late hour, Mr. Kriebel still received him. Regarding this claim, he still denied it. First, he said, "I cannot say yes or no. I have not received any information about this matter. In other words, if this were the case, I would have received information from my government. Since there is no news at all, I am very doubtful." He then said, "I recall that Japanese newspapers once carried reports of an alliance between China and the Soviet Union, which your government denied. The claim of a German-Japanese alliance is probably the same. Germany has indeed denied it."</p>
<p>Japanese Embassy Personnel Also Dismiss the Claim - The New Sound News Agency reporter then telephoned Mr. Minoru Hachiya, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy's Information Department, who also dismissed the claim, saying, "I have never heard of it. I only learned about it now that you are telling me. I dare say that this claim is absolutely untrue; otherwise, we would not be completely unaware."</p>
<p>Contents of the Alliance Discussed by Mr. Patterson - The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that Mr. Paul Patterson, a reporter for the Baltimore Sun, arrived in Shanghai on Monday (16th) afternoon aboard the SS Conte Rosso. According to reports, Japan and Germany reached an agreement on an alliance two weeks ago. The authorities warned foreigners not to spread this news and prohibited Japanese newspapers in northern Japan from publishing it. The Taitung Daily News (transliteration) was banned from publishing because it followed the speculation of other newspapers and carried news that a certain agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy to deal with Soviet Russia was about to be finalized and would be submitted to the Privy Council. The Japan Advertiser, an American-run newspaper, was ordered by the Japanese authorities to suspend publication for one day because it reprinted a summary of the news carried by the Taitung Daily News. The correspondents of the New York Times attempted to send out this news, but it was intercepted by censors. The content is currently kept secret, but it is expected that the full text will be accepted by the treaty countries before the convocation of the Diet on December 24th. This alliance is indeed aimed at dealing with Soviet Russia. According to reports, the Japanese authorities issued a brief communiqué last Sunday, stating that there was an extremely important diplomatic event that would be submitted to the Cabinet for discussion in the near future. At the same time, the German Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Dirksen, had just returned to Tokyo from Berlin. After Mr. Dirksen's arrival, the Japanese political scene was unusually active. The Ambassador first met with Prime Minister Hirota on Wednesday afternoon and then held a 40-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence the next day. He then visited Vice Foreign Minister Horinouchi. As a result, various newspapers began to speculate. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun stated that if the Ambassador had only returned to his post and made a courtesy visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would not have been so rushed. There must be other incidents involved. The newspaper also stated that the Ambassador had formally discussed Japanese-German relations with the Japanese Foreign Minister. The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the German Ambassador's visit to the Foreign Minister was to convey important talks in accordance with new instructions brought by his home government. The Kyoto Shimbun and the Nichi Nichi Shimbun also made similar comments, stating that the Ambassador and Mr. Hirota discussed the matter for about an hour, and that the matter discussed was Germany's policy in Europe and the Far East, both emphasizing that Japan and Germany should stand on a common front to resist Soviet Communism. The authorities initially did not pay attention to this speculation until the Taitung Daily News disclosed the facts, causing the situation to become tense, and then they added restrictions. Although Berlin and Tokyo have both denied it recently, it is no longer a question that Japan and Germany will unite to curb the expansion and spread of Communism. The alliance between the two countries will be submitted to the Privy Council meeting in two or three weeks by Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita. The specific terms and the maturity of the agreement, as well as the parties involved, are not yet clear. However, according to well-informed Japanese sources, the agreement will be "left open" so that other countries will have the opportunity to join. As for which country will join hands with Germany and Japan, it is still not certain. It is generally believed that it must be Italy, as Germany and Italy have recently held talks and there is a strong trend towards organizing a common front to resist Communism. However, the Japanese are very skeptical about Italy's participation. Also, when the Duke's father, Wang Mingnian, went to England to participate in the coronation ceremony of King Edward VIII, he will make a brief stop in Berlin on the way to meet with Hitler to explain the importance of establishing a new relationship between Germany and Japan. This matter has already spread abroad. The Japanese who are not related to the current government are paying great attention to the Japanese-German alliance, wondering what the reactions of countries such as Britain, France, and the United States will be, and what steps China will take thereafter, which they are paying close attention to. According to reports, the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, has recently returned to his post from Berlin. Whether Dr. Trautmann's trip is related to the German-Japanese alliance is unknown, but the Soviet Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, is currently on his way back to Moscow. Both of these events are attracting attention. According to reports, Mr. Patterson is accompanied by his son on this trip from Japan and will take the original ship to Singapore tomorrow morning, and then will go to Europe for a period of time.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Decide to Establish the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Relief Association; Immediately Prepare Large Sums of Money to Remit to Suiyuan; Designation of Banks and Money Shops to Collect Donations Questioned</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Shanghai Local Association Chairman Du Yuesheng, for the purpose of comforting and rescuing the officers and soldiers in Suiyuan who are suppressing bandits, convened a joint meeting of various groups at 5:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Mu Ouchu, Wang Xiaolai, Jiang Wenyu, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, Pei Yunqing, Qin Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Shao Yanshan, Jin Runxiang, Lin Kanghou, Yan Esheng, Pang Jingzhou, and others. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After reporting the main purpose of the meeting, the following resolutions were made: (1) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Red Cross Society will jointly form the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort and Relief Committee; (2) Twenty-five people, including Xu Jili, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Rutang, Yan Fuqing, Li Fuxun, Wu Yunzhai, Yan Esheng, Ke Ganchen, Hu Yunqiu, Gui Yanfang, and others, were nominated as members of the committee; (3) Jin Runxiang was nominated as the Secretary-General of the Committee, and Yang Guanbei as the Deputy Secretary-General; (4) Raise a large sum of money to comfort the soldiers on the front line; (5) Designate China, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Real Estate, Continental, Salt, Jincheng, Zhongnan, and Zhonghui ten banks, the Four-Bank Savings Societies, as well as Fuyuan, Tongyu, and Tongkang three money shops to collect comfort and relief donations from all walks of life; (6) Nominate Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xinzhi, Li Fuxun, Qin Runqing, Shao Yanshan, Pei Yunqing, and others as economic committee members.</p>
<p>One-Yuan Movement: More than ten members of the First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city, including Ge Futian, Liu Zhongying, and Chen Jiufeng, specifically jointly proposed to the association to advocate the "One-Yuan Aid Sui Movement" to encourage the morale of the front-line soldiers and plan for national salvation. The Shanghai Business Joint Association has scheduled its thirteenth executive committee meeting for 3:00 PM today to discuss and implement it. The recommendation of the committee members is recorded as follows: "Regarding the recommendation, the bandit-puppets have invaded the border, and the Sui situation is serious. Fortunately, Chairman Chuan and all officers and soldiers have resisted loyally, but have not yet succeeded. However, the bandit-puppets are moving restlessly, and their background is clear. To kill the enemy and achieve results, it depends on strengthening rear support. Futian and others deeply feel that since September 18th, the territory has been shrinking day by day, and Suiyuan has become the only barrier. In terms of the situation, Sui is actually the throat of the provinces in North China. If there is any negligence, North China will be in danger, and the entire country may be overthrown. Therefore, the invasion of bandit-puppets is by no means a local war, but the continued progress of the policy of destroying China. It is urgent to concentrate the power of the whole country, rise up to rescue, and everyone should recognize that saving Sui is saving the country, and saving the people of Sui is saving oneself. The situation is urgent and cannot be observed any longer. Moreover, when this severe winter is approaching, the soldiers are cold and bitter in the icy and snowy land of the northern border, and urgently need reinforcements. Driven by conscience, Futian and others cannot bear to sit idly by, so they specifically jointly propose to the association to advocate the "One-Yuan Aid Sui Movement," and the funds raised will be used to comfort and support the officers and soldiers on the front line. The purpose and method are briefly described as follows: (1) The "One-Yuan Aid Sui Movement" is easy to carry out universally, and everyone can do their best to serve the country; (2) The one-yuan donation should be collected by local banks and chambers of commerce; (3) The donation receipt must be affixed with the seal of the supervisory authority, and the number must be specified, one yuan per number, to show seriousness; (4) Donors who are scattered numbers can combine several people to collect one yuan for payment; (5) This movement will be implemented from the date of resolution until the end of this year; (6) Please telegraph to all sectors of the country to promote it uniformly; (7) Strictly formulate supervision of donation collection and use methods. The humble opinions must be submitted to the meeting for discussion as soon as possible, and a definite implementation method should be detailed to encourage morale and plan for national salvation, and I can't help but look forward to it."</p>
<p>Business Joint Association Telegram: The National Chamber of Commerce Federation yesterday telegraphed the National Government and Suiyuan Chairman Chuan separately. The two telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Military Affairs: The bandit-puppets have invaded Suiyuan. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers are guarding the territory and fighting back head-on. Since September 18th, the invaders have been rampant, and the national borders have been shrinking day by day. This invasion of bandit-puppets is actually driven by others. Our central government should take advantage of this opportunity of national unification and national restoration to implement the principles of sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and on the one hand, quickly dispatch heavy troops to launch a major crusade, and on the other hand, gather talents to jointly deliberate on decision-making. I hereby submit this telegram, hoping to be adopted, then the nation will be fortunate, the country will be fortunate, the chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, Lin Kanghou, bows; (2) To Suiyuan Provincial Government Chairman Chuan: The bandit-puppets have been driven by others to invade the border, and you, sir, have personally gone to the front to command, fight back head-on, and firmly defend the territory. Your loyalty and bravery are admired by the whole country. I also hope that you will continue to work hard and launch a major crusade, and where the flags point, destroy this ugly captive. In addition to sending another telegram to the central government requesting overall planning strategies, I hereby send this telegram, vowing to lead the merchants and people of the whole country as a backing, the chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, Lin Kanghou, bows.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Telegram: To Suiyuan Chairman Chuan: I was shocked to read in the newspaper that the bandit-puppets have stepped into the country, and the Sui border is in urgent need. Fortunately, you, sir, have strictly organized the army and are determined to defend it to the death, and the invaders have not succeeded. However, the bandit-puppets are connected, spreading horizontally and vertically, and a certain country sent planes to drop bombs, fueling the disaster. The safety of the country and the survival of the nation, for better or worse, should be regarded as a shift in this situation. I also hope that you, sir, will lead the officers and soldiers to protect the country's territory. This association vows to lead 800,000 workers in Shanghai to be the backing of you, sir, and the front-line soldiers. I hereby send this telegram, waiting for good news.</p>
<p>City Farmers' Association Telegram: To Suiyuan Provincial Government Chairman Chuan: The bandit-puppets have invaded the border, and alarming reports are frequently sent. You, sir, lead the generals and exert their lives in the border area to defend my territory. Aircraft from a certain country entered the border and dropped bombs, fueling the bandit rebellion and trampling on the country's territory. The cruelty of their intentions is obvious. I also hope that you, sir, will take the rights and lives of the country and the people into consideration, bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the rock-solid border, comfort the ardent hopes of the people of the whole country, and the electric report is divine and can't help but be a screen camp.</p>
<p>Railway Party Departments Telegram: To Chairman Chuan and the officers and soldiers on the front line: To Suiyuan Provincial Government Chairman Chuan: The bandit-puppets have invaded Suiyuan for days, and the whole country is shocked and angry. The soldiers are under your command, determined to defend the territory, and fighting back head-on. After listening to the news, I admire it very much. I believe that Sui is our country's barrier, and the country's rights and the people's lives are of great importance. I beg you to strictly order the officers and soldiers to continue to fight bravely to destroy the strong invaders and consolidate the border. In addition to raising money for comfort, this association will first send this telegram to respectfully wait for the victory. The special party department of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bows.</p>
<p>Frugality and Labor Army Association: The colleagues of the two railway party departments and the administration held a meeting yesterday in the auditorium of the special party department of the railway to prepare for the frugality and labor army. They established the colleagues' frugality and labor army committee of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, formulated methods for frugality and labor army, and planned to nominate the entire members of the special party department Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Song Chuanji, Feng Qishu, Wang Weixia, Chen Fuhai, Yin Zhilu, Wu Yaowan, Lin Xiaojin, Secretary-General Zhong Guoyuan, Administration Bureau Chief Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director He Molin, and the directors of various departments, the directors and supervisors of the two railway trade unions Yuan Qiaofu, Zhao Yu, Jiang Jiaxiang, etc., and the principals of Shanghai Wusong Suzhou Changzhou Nanjing Zhabei Ningbo Baisha Rotary Elementary Schools, etc., as members of the Frugality and Labor Army Committee to preside over all the ongoing affairs. All the methods of frugality and labor army are being drafted.</p>
<p>Discussion in Cultural Circles: The China Cultural Construction Association and more than one hundred cultural groups affiliated with it believe that the war in Suiyuan is imminent, and the soldiers on the front line are fighting for the country, which is admired by the whole country. However, the first priority of the army's suppression of bandits is supply, and all Chinese people should give them material comfort. It is scheduled for 2 pm on the 19th of this month to convene a joint meeting of schools, groups, and press colleagues in the city at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road, Nanshi, to discuss practical assistance methods to comfort the soldiers on the front line who are fighting against the enemy.</p>
<p>Accountant Association Telegram: The National Certified Public Accountants Association and the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association jointly telegraphed Chairman Chuan and the soldiers on the front line yesterday, "To Chairman Chuan, Suiyuan Provincial Government, Guisui: The bandits are restless, and you are working hard to command the troops, braving the snow and cold, which is admired by the whole country. Your loyalty is shining like the sun, and your past achievements have long been known. The soldiers' righteousness soars to the sky, and they share the same hatred of the enemy. I send this telegram to wish you a great victory and to express my humble sincerity and to encourage the soldiers." The National Certified Public Accountants Association and the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association bowed together.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Went to Hong Kong Last Night</h3>
<p>To Preside Over the Reopening of the Guangdong Bank Headquarters</p>

Two million yuan of new shares have been raised, one million yuan of old shares have been converted, and four million five hundred thousand yuan of creditor shares, totaling seven million five hundred thousand yuan. Song Ziwen has been elected as the chairman of the board. The Hong Kong headquarters is scheduled to reopen on the 23rd, but the reopening date of each branch is still to be decided by the headquarters, and a manager has been appointed. Chairman Song originally planned to fly to Hong Kong from Shanghai by China Aviation Shanghai-Hankou plane yesterday morning, but the plan was temporarily suspended due to an incident. He visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at the Central Bank at 10:30 am and left at 11:15 am. He changed to taking the Changxing Steamboat Company's Russian Empress ship at 9:00 pm. Secretary Chen Kangqi and five other staff members accompanied him to preside over the opening of the Hong Kong headquarters of the Guangdong Bank. The ship docked at the Gonghexing Wharf on East Broadway. The bank had previously sent Huo Baoshu, an auditor from the General Management Office of the Bank of China, to Hong Kong from Shanghai last week to prepare. As for the reopening date of the Shanghai branch, it is said to be set for the 25th.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Summoned Meierhe Yesterday</h3>

<h3>International Issues Research Association Hosted a Banquet for the French Ambassador Last Night</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Naziya arrived in Shanghai from Beijing last week, then flew to Beijing on the 14th, stayed in Beijing for three days, and after meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang the day before yesterday, he took the 11:00 pm express train from Beijing to Shanghai the night before yesterday. He arrived at the North Station at around 7:00 am yesterday. The Consul General of the country in China, Boudas, went to meet him. After getting off the train, he went to rest at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, and then went to the country's consulate on Gongguan Road on the Bund at around 10:00 am to work. In the afternoon, he went to various schools established by the French Concession Public Works Bureau to inspect. It is reported that the ambassador will stay here for a long time, and will go to Beijing at any time in the future. After spending the New Year in the South, he will return to Beijing.</p>
<p>Welcome Banquet Last Night: The board of directors of the local International Issues Research Association specially hosted a welcome banquet for Naziya at the International Hotel at 8:00 pm last night and invited local Chinese and foreign celebrities to accompany him. Those who attended the banquet included Mayor of this city Wu Tiecheng, French Consul General in Shanghai Boudas, Consul Bulinghua, Manager of Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank Barr, Editor-in-Chief of Havas News Agency Tan Shigu, as well as Wang Chonghui, Liu Zhanen, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xinliu, Cao Yunxiang, Dong XianGuang, Li Zhaoshi, He Dekui, Qian Xinzhi, Zou Bingwen, Zhang Jixian, Liu Hongsheng, Zu Jingsheng, and more than twenty other people.</p>
<p>Guo's Speech: After taking their seats, Chairman Guo Bingwen delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the board of directors, which roughly stated, "Mr. Naziya, the first French Ambassador to China, is a skilled French diplomat who has served as a consul in Shanghai and Kunming, achieving remarkable results and maintaining cordial relations with Chinese people. Now, as an envoy, he has come to the East to revisit old places, renewing old friendships and establishing new ones, which is deeply gratifying. I believe that Ambassador Naziya has a clear understanding of the progress of our country's construction and the completion of unification in recent years. The national characteristics of the Chinese and French people have many similarities. They both love peace, firstly; they both love art, secondly; and they are both rich in republican spirit, thirdly. In terms of economy, the raw materials produced in China are mostly needed by France, and our country is now intent on construction. In terms of technology and economy, France can provide China with much help. Therefore, we firmly believe that China and France should continue their friendly relations and cooperate with each other in order to increase mutual benefits. Now that Mr. Naziya has been honored with a mission to China, he will be able to enhance the political, cultural, and economic relations between the two countries with his economic aspirations and diplomacy between China and France. This is what we sincerely pray for." Ambassador Naziya then delivered a speech to express his thanks and elaborated on Sino-French relations. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until after 10:00 pm, and then dispersed.</p>

<h3>Triumphant Return: Nanyang Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Representatives from Various Organizations Extend a Warm Welcome, Sharing Insights and Detailed Accounts</h3>
<p>The twelve members of the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, organized by the Chinese Industrial Associations Federation, returned to the country yesterday afternoon at 12:30 pm aboard the French postal vessel, General Joffre, after a four-month and one-day journey abroad. Representatives from various organizations in the city went to the port to welcome the group and hear a detailed account of their trip. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Organizations: The General Joffre docked at the China Merchants Wharf. Representatives from various welcoming organizations, holding welcome banners in advance, waited eagerly on the pier. These included Zhang Huikang of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, Lin Kanghou and Gu Huai of the National Federation of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Boyuan, and Fang Yexian of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xingyao of the China National Products Sales Association, Cheng Shouchong of the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Union, Pan Yangyao of the National Products Exposition, Sun Choucheng of the National Goods Factory Federation, Xu Jianruo and Sun Daosheng of the Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, Wang Zhisheng of the Chinese Industrial Associations Federation, Shao Daren of the Zhengyi Society, Cai Shengbai of the Mayer Silk Weaving Factory, Hu Xiyuan of the Arbuthnot Electric Company, representatives from various factories, and over a hundred relatives and friends of the group members.</p>
<p>Disembarkation and Parade: After the group members shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming representatives, they formed a line, sang the association song, and shouted "Long Live the Republic of China! Long Live the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association! Long Live the Nanyang Inspection Group!" Afterwards, they boarded over thirty pre-arranged cars and proceeded along the Bund, into Nanjing Road, via Jing'an Temple Road, turning onto Avenue Foch, to the Great World, turning into the Avenue Edward VII Bund of the French Concession, passing Avenue Edward VII, Yu Qiaqing Road, Hankou Road, and turning into Jiujiang Road, to the Zhengyi Society.</p>
<p>Tea Reception: The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association hosted a tea reception at the Zhengyi Society to welcome all group members and factory representatives. The reception began with a welcoming speech by Zhang Huikang, a director of the association, followed by a response and brief report by the group leader, Gao Shiheng. The meeting then adjourned, and the group members returned to their residences to rest. Given the great interest in this trip from various sectors in the country, they decided to prepare a brief report on the return journey while on the ship and distributed it to the welcoming personnel.</p>
<p>Joint Banquet: This morning, group leader Gao Shiheng will report to the International Trade Bureau and other agencies. This evening at 6 pm, six organizations, including the National Federation of Commerce, the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Union, the Chinese Industrial Associations Federation, and the National Products Movement Federation, will host a banquet for the group at the Bankers' Association. It is reported that other organizations are also planning to hold banquets in the coming days, and the dates are being arranged.</p>
<p>Returning Group Members: The group consisted of fourteen members at the time of departure. Xu Zhaolin returned to China from Manila ahead of schedule, and Lu Qiliang also returned from Singapore in advance. Liao Qiumin and Yang Shikang remained in Singapore. Twelve members remain. Deng Qiyao did not go to Medan, but Yao Ziliang and Li Rensheng of the Zhenhua Paint Company joined, bringing the total to thirteen. With the exception of Yao and Li, who remained in Singapore, the returning members are group leader and deputy group leader Gao Shiheng and Hu Shicheng, secretary Yang Chonggao, and members Wang Gongquan, Zhuang Maoru, Gao Juxin, Li Shenyan, Zhang Zuyin, Xu Xuejie, Jiang Junrui, Deng Qiyao, and Liao Qiumin, totaling twelve people.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary: The group provided the following account of their trip: The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group departed on July 16 of this year and returns today, for a total journey of four months and two days. They visited five territories: the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Siam, and French Annam, and twelve major cities: Manila, Surabaya, Bandung, Bogor, Batavia, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Penang, Bangkok, Medan, and Saigon. They spent one to three weeks in each city, or one to two days. In addition to their time in each city, they spent thirty-five days traveling by train and ship. The governments of various countries granted exemptions for the inspection group's entry procedures, such as waiving entry fees and exempting baggage checks, to show their hospitality. Various shipping and railway companies offered discounts on fares.</p>
<p>Work Situation: A total of seven national goods exhibitions were held in various locations, each lasting five to seven days. The number of visitors reached over 290,000. The opening ceremony of each exhibition was officiated by prominent figures. In the Philippines, the ceremony was officiated by Mrs. Li Qingquan, and in Siam, by the Siamese Minister of Economic Affairs. In other locations, the wives of consuls officiated. During the exhibition hours, people flocked in like a tide, causing overcrowding. In Siam, twenty Boy Scouts were hired to maintain order at the venue, but it was still difficult to maintain order, as overseas Chinese were eager to see national goods first. Overseas Chinese were eager to learn about the situation in the country. Therefore, the group leader gave over fifty public lectures in various locations, introducing the political, diplomatic, construction, and industrial and commercial situations of the motherland, which aroused considerable attention and patriotic enthusiasm among overseas Chinese, leaving a good impression. In particular, students from schools gathered in the thousands to listen quietly. In addition to serving at the exhibitions, group members were divided into groups by local chambers of commerce and led to conduct on-site investigations. Since the commercial centers of various places were in the hands of overseas Chinese, the investigation work was extremely convenient. Moreover, enthusiastic overseas Chinese merchants provided samples from various countries for reference, providing the group members with valuable information, which was the greatest gain of this trip.</p>
<p>Sales of National Goods: Among the products participating in this exhibition, Huasheng fans were the most prominent, receiving a welcome everywhere and proving to be more than a match for foreign products. Xingye tiles, as an emerging Chinese industry, were sought after by both Chinese and foreign agents. Mayer silks were also popular, but whether their prices could compete remains to be seen. Cosmetics from the China Chemical Industry Company and the Family Industry Company also showed promise, but their packaging should be improved. Seasonings have a large market in Nanyang and sales were quite satisfactory. Knitted goods and towels can be promoted, but market competition is fierce. Grass and rattan products from the forests aroused the interest of Europeans. Paint already has a market in Nanyang, and national products are better than some foreign products, but prices are a problem. Enamelware has a large market, beyond expectations. Kangyuan products attracted attention and show promise. Sheet metal has a large market, but import restrictions are a problem. Fortunately, negotiations have yielded results, and large quantities can be exported. Light bulbs can be promoted, depending on low prices. Felt hats are also selling well, and some people want to buy Huafu display items. New drugs show promise, but advertising is needed. Import taxes on tobacco and alcohol are very high, but overseas Chinese are very willing to use national tobacco and alcohol. Soap, especially scented soap, has the potential for promotion. Glassware was inquired about by many overseas Chinese merchants, but the exhibition did not bring many samples. Yaguang bakelite attracted attention, catering to the consumption of high-end customers. Stationery is in great demand by students. Just taking domestically produced fountain pens as an example, they are rarely seen in Nanyang. Hot water bottles need to be improved in style, because those used domestically are for boiling water, while those used in Nanyang are for cold water. Yixin toothbrushes have won good praise, especially those with celluloid handles. The above is a general overview. In short, Nanyang has never known or seen the emerging industries of national goods. Making great efforts to introduce them, the future is very bright.</p>
<p>Appointing Consultants: In order to establish lasting connections between overseas Chinese and domestic industrial circles, the inspection group, in the name of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, appointed leaders of overseas Chinese communities in various places as honorary consultants. These included fifteen people, such as Li Qingquan in Manila, eighteen people, such as Li Shuanghui in Surabaya, twelve people, such as Zhuang Xiyan in Batavia, fifteen people, such as Hu Wenhu in Singapore, one person, Liang Shennan in Ipoh, seventeen people, such as Lin Liandeng in Penang, eleven people, such as Chen Shouming in Siam, and twelve people, such as Qiu Yiheng in Medan, totaling 101 people. Letters of appointment as honorary consultants were sent to all of them, inviting them to take office. All the consultants expressed their willingness to assist in order to promote the development of Nanyang trade.</p>
<p>Opinions of Overseas Chinese: Overseas Chinese have expressed that they are eager to love the country and will not lag behind others. Moreover, Nanyang commerce is in the hands of overseas Chinese merchants. If national goods can compete with international markets in terms of price, then even with a difference of 5% to 10%, overseas Chinese are willing to make efforts to promote sales. The improvement of styles should be studied, because most of the national goods coming to Nanyang are sold to the local population, and should suit their psychology. This is the opinion of the retailers. As for direct consumers, they always want to use national goods but suffer from not being able to buy them. Overseas Chinese merchants also hope that the government can develop banks and shipping lines in Nanyang, because having domestic banks and shipping routes can greatly reduce costs. They hope that domestic industry can have an overall plan in Nanyang, with mutual connections. Overseas Chinese are willing to assist with their greatest efforts. The Nanyang Trade Inspection Group fully accepts the good intentions of overseas Chinese and promises to strongly urge the attention of the government and the public after returning to the country.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Group Leader: Group leader Gao Shiheng issued a written statement saying that the group was encouraged by the Ministry of Industry and the International Trade Bureau, and assisted by Director Zhang of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and all the directors. They departed on July 16, bearing a major mission, heading to Nanyang, the lifeline of our country's overseas trade. However, his colleagues were ashamed of their mediocrity and took on heavy responsibilities. Their experience and knowledge were lacking. They firmly believed that international trade must find a way out, and Nanyang is where our country's overseas Chinese gather. Their eagerness for national goods is perhaps even greater than that of the people of the country, so they resolutely set out. During the journey, they received timely guidance from various sectors in the country, and were constantly backed by the country, which was deeply appreciated. On the day of their return, they were welcomed by various organizations and relatives and friends, and were grateful for their warm hospitality. The experiences and feelings are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome from Overseas Chinese: There are more than six million overseas Chinese in Nanyang, including 1.2 million in British Malaya, 2.5 million in Siam, and over one million in the Dutch East Indies. In all the places the delegation visited, overseas Chinese organizations joined together to welcome the group, as it was the first time that a Chinese commercial organization had come to Nanyang. The activities were grand, and they were eager to see national goods first. Although the group aimed to reduce social events and do more work, banquets were still held every evening. In their words, their patriotic enthusiasm and sincerity were revealed. In every place the group arrived, they merged with the overseas Chinese, and in a short period of time, they helped each other and cooperated, showing the supreme glory of our Chinese nation. This was the most pleasant part of the journey.</p>
<p>Impressions of the National Goods Exhibition: Whenever the group arrived in a place, it held a national goods exhibition. The method was to first send the exhibits to the local chambers of commerce, and then unpack and display them upon the group's arrival. Therefore, this kind of exhibition was actually a cooperation between the group and the local chambers of commerce. After the exhibition was completed, it was unconditionally donated to the local chambers of commerce to organize a permanent exhibition hall. A total of seven exhibitions were held, with about 290,000 visitors. In other words, one out of every twenty-five overseas Chinese visited. Overseas Chinese students had a vague impression of the motherland. At first, they did not know that China also had industry, and some even did not believe that they were products of the motherland. After visiting, they were very satisfied and greatly increased their patriotic sentiments. In some places, the crowding of visitors exceeded expectations, and the order of the venue could hardly be maintained. It can be seen that overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about protecting national goods.</p>
<p>Emphasis from Various Governments: The governments of various countries attached great importance to the group. In addition to providing very favorable treatment for entry procedures and during the period of residence, without any difficulties, the Dutch East Indies and Siam formally received the group in the name of the government. It was regarded as a special honor by overseas Chinese that a Chinese merchant group received such treatment from the local government. The group also enjoyed interacting with them due to the importance of public diplomacy. Various countries expressed their welcome to the group's trip to Nanyang, and conducted informal business discussions to promote the development of international trade. They expressed their satisfaction with our country's new industrial products and hoped that prices could compete in the national goods market. Various countries expressed their willingness to purchase more. The group, being a non-governmental organization, paid great attention to the emotional connection between our overseas Chinese and the local people, in order to enhance the feelings between nationalities. In the Philippines, there is the Sino-Philippine National Association, with the Philippine President and our country's Consul General to the Philippines, Li Qingquan, as honorary presidents, and our overseas Chinese leaders Li Qingquan and Xue Fenshi as the center. In the Dutch East Indies, there is the Sino-Dutch Trade Promotion Committee, with the Dutch East Indies Minister of Economic Affairs and our Consul General to the Dutch East Indies, Song, as the chairpersons. In Siam, there is the Sino-Siamese Association, with the Siamese Minister of Economic Affairs and our Commercial Commissioner to Siam, Chen Shouming, as the chairpersons, with members from well-known figures from China and Siam. The group participated in or hosted or visited each organization to promote the development of public diplomacy.</p>
<p>Nanyang Commerce Is in the Hands of Overseas Chinese: Our overseas Chinese have a long history in Nanyang. No matter where, they have footprints. Based on the hard work of the pioneers, they have created today's situation. Whether it is import, wholesale, or retail, commerce is in the hands of overseas Chinese. However, most of the goods they handle are foreign goods. The mistakes of the past lie in the lack of</p>

<p>mutual understanding. If national goods can be priced low, they will definitely be able to compete. Overseas Chinese merchants are willing to change direction and buy national goods. In this exhibition, many emerging industries were eager to become agents, which is a clear sign. Therefore, whether national goods have hope in Nanyang depends on whether domestic industries are determined to join the world's commercial battle.</p>
<p>The Trend of Trade in Various Places in Nanyang: Trade in the Philippines can freely enter and exit, but the tariffs are very heavy. Certain goods almost monopolize the market. Although American goods enjoy tariff exemption preferences, they are still not comparable to the Dutch East Indies. All goods are restricted, and it seems that another direction should be sought for the development of Chinese goods. The conclusion of a commercial treaty is extremely important. In Malaya, except for textiles, which are restricted, and tobacco and alcohol, which are taxed, other goods are tax-free, and the consumption power is large. The market has an upward trend. Siam is an agricultural country with 2.5 million overseas Chinese, and the consumption power is quite large. In Annam, the French government has built high tariff barriers, making it difficult for national goods other than French goods to enter. Therefore, if national goods want to develop in Nanyang, it seems that Singapore should be the main base and slowly develop. In short, the group believes that the Nanyang market is our country's only overseas lifeline, which cannot be abandoned and should not be abandoned. However, the operations of overseas Chinese in the past were individual. In the future, there should be a whole, and whether it is the government or the people, there should be a practical plan and definite steps. All related parties should work together to cope with the extraordinary environment. In addition, there are more than 6 million overseas Chinese in Nanyang who are willing to be salesmen, and success is not difficult, but it depends on how hard the Chinese people work.</p>
<h3>Toyota and Other Factories United in Strike Again, Clashes Occurred with Several Injuries on Both Sides, No. 2 and No. 13 Factories of the Nei Wai Cotton Mill Also Went on Strike—Workers of the Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill (British owned) To Petition This Morning—</h3>
<p>Special report from this newspaper: The Toyota Old Factory, located between Jessfield Road and Zhongshan Road, with 400 to 500 male day laborers, 140 to 150 male day and night laborers, and about 3,000 female workers in the entire factory, experienced disturbances at 5:30 pm yesterday. The male and female night laborers were just heading to work. Around 6:00 pm, when the day laborers were about to leave work, a disturbance suddenly broke out. The workers shouted slogans in unison. The 40 to 50 Japanese marines stationed in the factory saw that there were too many workers and did not take any action. The timid female workers left the factory first. Then, the workers went across the bridge along Jessfield Road to the Toyota New Factory. At that time, the night laborers of the New Factory had already started work. The factory staff saw a large number of workers coming and knew that something must have happened, so they locked the iron gate. The workers wandered and squeezed outside the gate. After about a quarter of an hour, they finally squeezed open the iron gate and rushed in, shouting slogans. Before long, the lights went out, and the factory was in chaos, unable to work. About 1,000 male and female workers in the New Factory smashed some items in the factory. The factory staff reported to the police station, and the police station immediately sent 50 to 60 reserve team members to suppress the situation, intending to disperse the workers. Therefore, they used batons to block and drive them away. However, due to the large number of people, they could not quell the situation. After about two hours of stalemate, some people were injured in the chaotic crowd. The police feared that the situation would escalate, so they sent about 80 members of the merchants' regiment to the scene. At one point, more than 10 workers were arrested. Seeing this situation, the general workers were very angry and shouted for the release of the detained workers. The Public Security Bureau of the Sixth District of Caojiadu heard the alarm and also sent police to the scene. At the same time, they reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent 60 to 70 police officers to suppress the situation. In order to dispel misunderstandings and prevent the expansion of the labor unrest, the detained workers were released, and the workers were able to disperse. By this time, it was already 11:30 pm. It is reported that the injured workers include Yuan Jiaquan, a native of Henan, who suffered internal injuries, and Liu Xiaozhong, who suffered a head injury and is currently being treated in the hospital, according to the Dagong She. All day and night shift workers of the Toyota No. 1 and No. 2 factories and the Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 2 and No. 13 factories, owned by Japanese merchants in Shanghai West, went on strike yesterday. The striking workers of the Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill, owned by British merchants, will petition the party and government. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Labor Unrest at Nei Wai No. 2 and No. 13 Factories</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Nei Wai Cotton Mill, located at No. 62 Robison Road, consists of four sections: the spinning section of No. 1 Factory, the weaving section, the spinning section of No. 2 Factory, and the weaving section, with a total of over 2,500 male and female workers. At about 6:00 am yesterday, over 260 day-shift workers in the weaving section of No. 2 Factory went on strike to demand higher wages. The 260 night-shift workers also refused to enter the factory. Workers in other sections continued to work as usual. However, according to the striking workers of the factory, if the factory still does not increase wages, they will all join the strike to promote the factory's awareness.</p>
<p>Toyota No. 1 and No. 2 Factories Jointly Strike</p>
<p>Over 5,000 male and female workers in the Toyota Cotton Mill No. 1 and over 3,000 male and female workers in the Toyota Cotton Mill No. 2, located on Zhongshan Road in Caojiadu, jointly went on strike around 5:50 pm yesterday. The reason for the strike was also to demand higher wages, and clashes occurred at one point. A translator named Wang from the No. 1 Factory was beaten by the workers. Several male and female workers were injured and arrested. After the Caojiadu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau made great efforts to suppress the situation, it was pacified. All workers have now left the factory. Also, all workers of the Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 13, located on Robison Road, did not enter the factory after the day shift workers left work at 5:30 pm yesterday and have gone on strike.</p>
<p>Disputes Brewing in Other Factories</p>
<p>There are many Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai West, including the Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 1 and No. 2 at No. 62 Robison Road, the No. 3 and No. 4 at No. 19 West Suzhou Road, the No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 at No. 14 West Suzhou Road, the No. 8 at No. 1286 Gordon Road, the No. 9 at No. 640 Mohawk Road, the Gongda No. 3 at No. 38 Jessfield Road, the Gongda No. 2 at No. 60 Singapore Road, the Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 on Weihai Road, the Tongyu No. 1 on Gordon Road, and the Rihua Factory at No. 98 Robison Road. Workers of Japanese-owned cotton mills have put forward demands, such as universal wage increases. The factory is trying to eliminate the potential unrest.</p>
<p>Hua Concession Authorities Closely Guarding</p>
<p>Since the labor unrest occurred at the Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 2 and the Toyota Cotton Mill No. 1, Tan Baoshou, the head of the Caojiadu Public Security Branch, has often led more than 40 armed policemen to be stationed inside and outside the factory for strict protection, and sent more than 10 policemen to protect the Japanese cotton mills in the vicinity. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau sent more than 60 policemen, riding in two trucks, to set up posts at the entrance of the factory. The Gordon Road patrol room of the Concession also sent dozens of Chinese and Western detectives and two red police cars, parked at the factory gate, to strictly guard for protection.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Workers Petition the Party and Government</p>
<p>Over 300 workers of the New Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill on Weihai Road in Yangshupu went on a general strike after opposing the foreman's exploitation of wages. They put forward seven demands, but the factory has not yet responded, so the workers continued to strike. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, more than 100 male and female workers went to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to petition for relief. The director, Wan Banghe, received them and promised to investigate the truth and then mediate. The workers of the factory will go to the party and government agencies separately at 10:00 am this morning to petition for assistance.</p>
<h3>Two Notices Issued by the Bankers' Association</h3>
<p>Income Tax Subcommittee Members　　One-Day Campaign for All Banks</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Bankers' Association's 15th Executive Committee meeting on the 13th of this month resolved to organize an Income Tax Subcommittee, it has sent letters to various banks to recommend representatives. Once the representatives are recommended, Pan Jiufen of the Bank of China will convene the first committee meeting to study the issue. As for the one-day campaign, it has also been sent to various banks for compliance after it was approved. The two notices are recorded below: (1) To the respected, Since the promulgation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the association has submitted to the Bank Association to organize a special committee to discuss and study the matter, and has solicited opinions from the various banks and local associations. As of now, the Bank Association has drafted an entire opinion, and many local associations have also replied. As the tax collection is imminent, it was submitted to the Executive Committee meeting for discussion today (13th). It was resolved that a subcommittee should be organized to carefully review and revise the opinions in order to form a perfect opinion for the Ministry of Finance to adopt. It is now estimated that the China, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, Mainland, Central South, Jin Cheng, Si Ming, National Goods, National China, Central Exchange, Reclamation, China Agricultural and Industrial, and Salt industries, a total of fifteen banks, will each recommend one representative to jointly organize the committee, and the Bank of China will be the convener. For this reason, the case records have been sent to various banks. It is hoped that the names of the representatives will be determined quickly and returned for convening a meeting. (2) To the respected, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., initiated the movement to contribute one day to the country and sent letters to the various trade associations to actively promote it. The method is that the stores will appropriately contribute a portion of their one-day business income, and the store employees and association staff will contribute all of their one-day salary income to the government for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations. Most trade associations have responded and followed. The association submitted it to the Executive Committee meeting for discussion and resolution on the 13th of this month. Since it is a matter of enriching the national defense movement, it should be imitated. However, it is difficult to calculate the bank's monthly business income. It is now decided to only contribute one day's salary of the staff to the government. For this reason, the notices have been sent to various banks for compliance. Please transfer the payments to the association for remittance to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Women's Circles in This City Initiate Assistance to Spanish Women and Children</h3>
<p>The Spanish Civil War has been going on for a long time, and the suffering of women and children is rare in history. The current siege of Madrid by the rebel army is particularly cruel. Based on the principles of international justice and humanitarian sympathy, the women's circles in this city have contacted many people to launch a movement to aid Spanish women and children. In the past few days, the signatories have included Soong Ching-ling, Shi Liang, Xu Guangping, Bai Wei, Shen Zijiu, Hu Ziying, Li Lan, Ou Cha, Shi Yifan, Du Junhui, Chen Boer, Dong Zhujun, and Luo Shuzhang, totaling over 30 people. It is reported that they will send representatives to visit the Spanish Chargé d'Affaires in Shanghai in the next few days, requesting that a message of condolence be forwarded back to their country. At the same time, they will engage in fundraising for practical assistance. A declaration has been drafted, calling on women and compatriots across the country to unite in assisting the Spanish government and people. Chinese women should especially learn from the spirit of Western women who sacrifice for their country.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Accused of Instructing Perjury, Continues to be Adjudicated - The Smoke Case Sentence Expires Next January - The Case of Instructing Perjury Has Been Delayed for Over Half a Year - Judge Chen Shuoying Takes Over, Trial Opens Today</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, formerly the head of the Tianchan Stage from Yancheng, president of the Jianghuai Association of Shanghai Fellow Provincials, was accused by Zhao Guangfu, a convict sentenced to life imprisonment for the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, of instigating the assassination. On September 10th of last year, the judicial police arrested Gu and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After trial, Gu was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Gu appealed the verdict to the Third High Court. After the court session, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing. During the scheduled sentencing period, suddenly there occurred</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan Bribed</p>
<p>Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai, brothers and guards of the Second Special Prison, to buy off Zhao Guangfu, the original plaintiff, and Zhang Xiaosizi (aka Zhang Tinggui), a fellow convict of Zhao in the same case, to recant their testimonies, offering them 3,000 yuan each. As a result, the Ma brothers only showed Zhang Xiaosizi's 3,000 yuan on a bankbook but refused to deliver the money, so Zhang reported Gu Zhuxuan to the Third High Court for bribery and recantation. During this period, other inmates, such as the monk Li and Wang A'er, also reported Gu</p>

Wang Ren, a prosecutor of the Second Special Court, investigated and found that the Ma brothers had abandoned their posts and fled, only detaining the two wardens, Jia and Wu. Furthermore, the prosecutor checked with the Daya Bank on Tianjin Road and confirmed that there was indeed a deposit of 3,000 yuan under the name of Zhang Sen. Opium paraphernalia were also found in the sick ward. Gu's brother, Gu Songmao, was also brought in for questioning. As a result, the prosecutor</p>
<p>Filed Indictment for Instruction of Perjury</p>
<p>Against the Gu Zhuxuan and Gu Songmao brothers in the same court's criminal division. Judge Li Changnian opened several court sessions but could not conclude the case. Gu's opium smoking case was prosecuted by the judicial police at the First Special Court. As a result, Gu was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. The two wardens, Jia and Wu, were prosecuted by the prosecutor for dereliction of duty and sentenced to five years of imprisonment each. The Third High Court suspended the progress of Gu Zhuxuan's appeal in the murder case due to the two new cases. Gu also appealed the verdict in the opium smoking case to the Third High Court. After</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The Third High Court opened a collegial panel to jointly try the murder and opium smoking cases. As a result, the court overturned the original sentence of 15 years of imprisonment in the murder case and acquitted Gu. The opium smoking case retained the original sentence of eight months of imprisonment, as well as one year of deprivation of civil rights. The court also ordered Gu to undergo rehabilitation for opium addiction within two months. The sentence for the opium case has already been sent to the Second Special Prison for execution. The term will expire on January 12th of next year. Gu filed a petition requesting that the date of his arrest and detention be offset against the sentence for the opium case. The Third High Court</p>
<p>Rejected the Ruling</p>
<p>As reported in previous newspapers. Gu's case of instructing perjury has been stalled for more than half a year. The news has been quiet. Judge Li Younian, who was handling the case, has been transferred to the Jiangxi High Court. Judge Chen Shuoying has now taken over the case, reviewed the case files, and scheduled a public trial at 2:00 PM today in the Second Tribunal. It is still recalled that the Third High Court mentioned Gu Zhuxuan's responsibility for buying off inmates Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi to recant their testimonies in the latter part of the verdict in Gu's murder case. It is unknown how the case will be decided in the future.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dance Hall Sends Representatives to Shanghai - Recruit Dance Hostesses, Victims of Scam - Intermediary Flees After Receiving Deposit - Encountered Mid-Way, Falsely Accused of Extortion</h3>
<p>Li Te, a Korean, is the manager of the Cathay Dance Hall in Hong Kong. Recently, the dance hall needed to recruit several Chinese dance hostesses, so Li, accompanied by Yan Lanting, a Chinese, came to Shanghai and stayed in room 311 of the New World Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Through Yan's introduction, Xiao Peilin, the owner of the Dou Pai Yi Hai Dance Research Institute at 14 Daqing Lane, 799 Fuzhou Road, from Ningbo, was hired to be in charge of recruiting dance hostesses. On the 13th of the month, Xiao went to the New World Hotel and told Li, etc., that he had already contacted</p>
<p>Vienna Dance Hall</p>
<p>Dance hostesses Zhang Bixia (resident of 15 Lane 181 Xiaoshadu Road), Zhang Qingying, and Pan Jiaoli. Zhang, etc., agreed to go to Hong Kong to dance, but each needed to borrow 30 yuan in advance. At the same time, he handed over photos of Zhang, etc., as proof. Since Li, etc., planned to depart on the 10th, they instructed Xiao to proceed as quickly as possible. Xiao immediately said that Zhang, etc., would all arrive on time. Li did not suspect anything else and</p>
<p>Handed Over 90 Yuan</p>
<p>To Xiao. Later, at 9:00 PM, Xiao called Lu Ying from Yangzhou and Fang Mei from Suzhou, female guides from the Metropolitan Dance Instruction Company at 457 Hankou Road, to Li's room and persuaded them to go to Hong Kong together. The two women agreed, but also needed to borrow 30 yuan each. Li immediately handed over 40 yuan in banknotes to Xiao, with the remaining 20 yuan to be paid the next day at noon. After receiving the money, Xiao left with the two women. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 AM, Li Te received</p>
<p>Phone Calls from the Two Women</p>
<p>Saying that Xiao did not give them the money, so they asked him to quickly deliver the money so that they could leave the next day. Li became suspicious and went to the Yi Hai Dance Institute to find Xiao the next day, but Xiao was nowhere to be found. Even the essential radio equipment of the dance institute had been removed. He realized that Xiao's actions were actually a scam and reported the case to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Until the other day, Li Te and Yan Lanting</p>
<p>At the Intersection of Park Road</p>
<p>Met Xiao and negotiated with him. Xiao agreed to return the money and claimed that the money was currently stored at the house of dance hostess Zhang Peixia at 11 Lane 145 Xiaoshadu Road, asking them to go and retrieve it together. Li, etc., followed him. Unexpectedly, when passing the Gordon Road Police Station, Xiao went straight into the police station and reported that Li, etc., were extorting him. After investigation by the police station, since Li, etc., had already reported</p>
<p>Xiao for Scamming</p>
<p>To the Chengdu Road Police Station, the police sent the group to that police station for investigation. After investigation by Chinese Detective Min Zhaoxian, Zhang Peixia denied that Xiao had stored the money at her place, and Zhang Bixia also denied receiving Xiao's money or going to Hong Kong. When questioned, Xiao denied receiving Li Te's money. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Delivered to the First Special Court</p>
<p>Criminal Division Two, Police Officer Qian Xunjiu clarified the details of the case and charged Xiao with violating Article 339, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Then, Li Te and Yan Lanting clarified the details of the money handover. Furthermore, Lu Ying and Fang Mei testified that Li had handed over 40 yuan to the defendant. When questioned, Xiao Peilin still claimed that he had never received the 90 yuan given by Li. As for the 40 yuan later, he claimed that he had already returned it to Li Te. After verifying the testimony, Judge Ye Sheng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled sentencing.</p>

<h3>Assassination of Shao Wenbin - Criminals Sentenced</h3>
<p>Qian Er committed - Another Case - Transferred to the Public Concession</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin from Pudong, also known as Ma Fu A'liu, was originally a groom who later switched to singing Tan Huang opera and then to operating an open flower lottery. Due to competition for profits in the lottery business, at 8:00 PM on July 28th of the 12th year of the Republic of China, he was assassinated in front of 21 Huageguo Road in the French Concession. At the time, detectives chased the assassins and killed one on the spot. The rest escaped. Later, the French police arrested Zhang Narong, an accomplice, and sent him to the Second Special Court. After the first instance, Zhang was sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhang confessed during the original trial that the assassination was planned by Cao A'wu, Shi Laohu, Lu Laoqi, and Zhao Liansheng, and carried out by Wang Shilong, who was at large. The French police then ordered their arrest. It was not until September 2nd of this year that Wang Shilong (41 years old, from Danyang, resident of 58 Fuxing Lane, 920 Xinzha Road) was arrested. Wang then confessed that his accomplice was Qian A'jin, also known as Ma Pi A'jin (50 years old, local resident, resident of 70 Yongping Lane, Megan Road). The detectives then arrested Qian. After the investigation, the prosecutors filed a joint indictment with the Second Special Court for murder and running a gambling flower lottery. Court President Wang Gangxu opened several court sessions to examine the evidence, question the witnesses, and hold debate before scheduling the sentencing. All of this was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, President Wang presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Wang Shilong as a repeat offender for joint murder to fourteen years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Wang was sentenced as a repeat offender for jointly intending to profit from running a gambling den to two years of imprisonment. The sentences will be served for fifteen years with a ten-year deprivation of civil rights. Qian A'jin was sentenced as a repeat offender for jointly intending to profit from running a gambling den to two years of imprisonment and fined 500 yuan. The fine can be converted to labor at a rate of three yuan per day. The murder charges were acquitted. However, since Wang and Qian had committed crimes in the Public Concession, the Public Police Station had previously petitioned the Special Court to prepare a document to the Second Special Court requesting transfer of the two individuals to the Public Concession for sentencing. After the judgment was handed down, the Public Police Station did not send anyone to take custody of the defendants. The judge ordered the defendants to be held pending verification.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Arrives at Store for Five Days - Immediately Attempts to Extort Owner - Acquitted Because He Was a Minor - Judge Admonishes, Hands Him Over to Family for Supervision - Previously Arrested Suspect Guo Sen Released in Court</h3>
<p>Shen Quanbing from Wuxi, the owner of Xie Changxiang Glass Shop at 328 East Ward Road, received a threatening letter by mail at 7:00 AM on the 17th of this month demanding 200 yuan. It instructed him to put twenty ten-yuan banknotes in a letter and seal it, then place it in the crack of the sign board at the store entrance at 7:00 PM. Someone would come to pick it up, or else the store would be set on fire. Shen reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese Detective Liu Zhaonian, etc., were dispatched to keep watch. Guo Sen, a suspect from Guangdong, was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. During interrogation, he denied the charges, saying that he was just passing by and urinating when he saw the letter and picked it up. He was ordered to be detained for further investigation. It was later found that the threatening letter was written by Wu Songquan (15 years old), an apprentice from Wuxi in the store. He was taken into custody at the police station the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court with Guo Sen brought to the stand. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the apprentice Wu had said at the police station that he had written the letter and wanted to switch to being a doctor. He had resigned from Shen's shop on the 14th. Shen then learned about the matter. Under questioning, Wu directly admitted it and was asked to write another letter that was exactly the same. Both letters were submitted for review, and it was requested that Guo Sen be released. The court approved it. When questioned, the apprentice Wu testified, "I want to study medicine, and no one else instructed me to do this." (It was found that the apprentice had been introduced to Xie Changxiang by a relative and had only been there for five days.) His age had not yet passed fourteen. Judge Zhong Qing gave him an admonishment and acquitted Wu Songquan, who was taken back to his hometown by his relative Zhao Guirong to be supervised by his parents.</p>
<h3>She Zikang - Rescued After Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Four Suicide Notes Detailed Hardship</p>
<p>She Zikang from Yangzhou, 41 years old, was fluent in Chinese and English. He used to work as a scribe at the HSBC Bank in Shanghai and had a good monthly income. Because he was addicted to gambling, She frequented gambling dens every night when they were popular in certain concessions several years ago, spending hundreds of gold coins without hesitation. Eventually, he accumulated huge debts. He even borrowed usurious loans from Indians, who subjected him to constant pressure. After losing his job, he was unable to make a living. His wife also left him to fend for himself. His only son was fostered in his brother-in-law's home. She drifted alone, borrowing from east to west, for the past four or five years. He had no place to eat, and now he had no way to borrow money. He had reached the point of desperation and wanted to end his life. The other day, at dusk, he boarded a Taikoo Company ferry at the Yangjingbang wharf to cross the Huangpu River. When the boat reached the middle of the river, She jumped into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. The captain immediately noticed and stopped the boat, managing to rescue him. He was sent to the Customs Water Police Station, where he explained his situation. Four suicide notes were found on his person. Since he had no family in Shanghai, detectives Huang Songsheng and Fu Guifu were assigned to send him to the Yangzhou Association of Fellow Provincials for relief. The four suicide notes are transcribed below: (1) The suicidee is named She Zikang, 41 years old. He has suffered all kinds of hardships and pain, leading to a lack of mental strength to save himself. Suicide is already six years late. If he had seen fewer unpleasant things six years ago, he would not have lost his family and died now. He feels sorry for himself. (2) To my cousin Deng Xuetai, 5 Xiangshan Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, Shanghai. I asked Jiang Hehe for one and a half yuan the other day, but he completely refused to help. Because of this, I felt ashamed to ask for help in Zhenjiang. Life is destined to end at one hundred years old. What is the pain of dying a few years earlier? My son, Xiao Lin, will have the hardest time. His father is unable to support him and commits suicide. This child will suffer. (3) To Zhu Zheguang and She Yayun, 17 Lane, Chunquan Town Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang Province. Please treat my son, Yongfang, differently in the future. I was forced to commit suicide by the pressure of life. The mother and son in Ding'an, Hangzhou, will be happy to hear of my suicide. (4) To Hu Atian, Nanyang Lane, Yangshuyuan, Luoshe, Wuxi. Your daughter, Zhao Di, has been avoiding me since I lost my job. She must have other ideas. I have been married to her for thirteen years, like a shadow. Since August 21st of this year, she has been avoiding me, the poor man, and her whereabouts are unknown. Now that I have committed suicide, you and your daughter can be happy. Your daughter doesn't have to avoid me anymore. She can choose another man to live with.</p>

<h3>Water Police Western Constable Viciously Assaults Employee</h3>
<p>Certificate Inspection Leads to Severe Beating; Victim Hospitalized with Widespread Injuries</p>
<p>Jiang Shu, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau, was ordered on the afternoon of the 16th, to supervise the construction of a wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong. While he was working, two water police officers, one Western constable named "Kesseloff" (transliteration) and one Chinese constable (badge number 19), passed by on patrol. Upon seeing the scene, the Chinese constable stepped forward and questioned Jiang about whether he had obtained a permit from the River Conservancy Bureau. Jiang replied that the wood engineering work was under the jurisdiction of the bureau and therefore no permit was obtained. Unexpectedly, the constable immediately ordered the work to be stopped. Jiang then reasoned with him, but was subjected to a severe beating. With his hands restrained, the Western constable, Kesseloff, rained blows and kicks upon him, causing widespread injuries. He was then forcibly dragged onto the patrol boat and taken back to the police station. Subsequently, after the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of the incident, it dispatched section member Zhou Huanzhang and municipal water patrol squadron inspector Pan Xutong to negotiate. Jiang was released and, after a brief interrogation by the squadron, was sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has dispatched a second section member, Liu Yong, to file a document to have Jiang brought back for questioning.</p>
<h3>Climbing an Iron Pipe to Clean a Chimney; Pipe Breaks, Man Dies</h3>
<p>The British-owned Botong Chimney Hygiene Cleaning Company dispatched three workers, including Wang Ajing, to a Westerner's residence at 15 Da Xi Road on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to clean the chimney. Unexpectedly, as Wang climbed an iron pipe to a height of 50 feet, the pipe suddenly broke, causing Wang to fall to the ground. He suffered severe injuries. His companions summoned an ambulance to the scene, and he was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital. However, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10:10 PM that evening. The Jing'an Temple police station ordered detective Shi Huanting to investigate. The body was taken to the Philen Road autopsy center. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the center to conduct an autopsy and confirmed the death.

<h3>Woman Huang Butian Sues Zhu Ziyun; Zhu Ziyun Case Concluded; Zhu Amao Admits in Court to Being Her Mother; Court Finds Further Confirmation Unnecessary; Settlement Record Created in Court</h3>
<p>Huang Butian, the daughter of the late famous national doctor Huang Xiaochu, recently hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to sue national doctor Zhu Ziyun in the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation that Zhu Amao (also known as Yuejuan), the daughter raised by Zhu, was her daughter with Zhu, and to stop Zhu Ziyun from abusing parental rights. Zhu Amao was also listed as the second defendant in the case. The Special Court has summoned the parties several times, but because Zhu Amao had not appeared, the hearing was adjourned. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu continued the hearing of the case in the Seventh Civil Court. The defendant Zhu Ziyun did not appear, but a lawyer appeared on his behalf. Zhu Amao suddenly appeared in court, stating that she was 23 years old, from Jiangwan, and married Zhang Naiwen, who resides at 122, Lane 760, Huishan Road, on October 27 of last year at the Hangzhou Restaurant. She admitted that Huang Butian was her biological mother and that Zhu was her father. She also stated that her father presided over her wedding. The court asked her if Zhu Ziyun admitted that she was his daughter. She replied that he currently did not admit it. The court stated that since Zhu Amao had already admitted it, there was no need for further confirmation, and since Zhu Amao had already married, parental rights had been terminated. Therefore, the court found that the case had no need to be litigated further. Subsequently, Zhu Ziyun's lawyer stated that his client did not admit that Zhu Amao was his daughter at all, and that the case was clearly a conspiracy between the plaintiff and her daughter to target Zhu Ziyun alone. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer requested the court to create a settlement record based on Zhu Amao's admission and to withdraw the part concerning Zhu Ziyun. The court approved the request, and the case was concluded.</p>

<p>Lu Zhu, a woman from Shaoxing residing at 1, Lane 344, Baik Road, 40 years old, sold her 17-year-old biological daughter, Lu Wenshu, to the brothel established by Xi Lai Fa Zhe at 67 Aige Road in the French Concession for 200 yuan due to poverty and the inability to maintain a livelihood. After Lu entered the brothel, she was forced to engage in prostitution. Recently, the brothel owner forced Lu to take contraceptive medicine and treated her very badly, causing her great suffering. On the 10th of this month, she seized an opportunity to escape and returned home, unwilling to go back to the brothel. On the morning of the day before yesterday, the brothel owner ordered Shen Awei and several others from Pudong to go to Lu's house and drag her to the intersection of Baik Road and Pike Road. They hired a Yunfei car with license plate number 12349 and planned to send her back to the brothel on Aige Road. At that time, the girl resisted and shouted for help, attracting a large crowd of onlookers. Yang Feizhang, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha police station, and Chinese constable Zhao Lai, number 2351, arrived and took Shen and the girl to the police station. After questioning them and learning the details, they arrested Shen and also arrested Lu's mother, Zhu. Yesterday morning, both were brought to the First Special Court.

<p>All patients at the China Leprosy Sanatorium in Dachang celebrated Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, which fell on the 31st of last month. On that day, they held a birthday commemoration ceremony in the sanatorium's auditorium and also saved one day's worth of vegetable expenses from the patients' food allowance, totaling 12 yuan in national currency, to be used to purchase an airplane. Yesterday, the funds were submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Purchase Airplane Birthday Celebration Committee for receipt so that they could contribute their small share to the effort and fulfill their civic duty. The sanatorium authorities, recognizing the patients' enthusiasm, did not want them to have bland food. Instead, they decided to save the money over a week, with vegetables still being served with meals every day to show their concern. The sanatorium's approach is commendable.

<h3>Xu Shiying; Representative Arrives in Shanghai to Mourn Duan;</h3>
<p>Mrs. Xu Huang Bodu Returned to China by Ship Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The wife of Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, Mrs. Huang Bodu, along with Huang Bodu, secretary of the Embassy in Japan, arrived in Shanghai at 7 AM yesterday morning aboard the Russian Queen of the Changxing Shipping Company. After disembarking at the Gonghexiang Wharf, they returned to their private residences to rest. Mrs. Xu, fatigued from the sea voyage, planned to visit the Duan residence on Avenue Joffre this morning to offer condolences. Huang Bodu visited the residence yesterday morning at 11 AM to offer condolences. Ambassador Xu, upon learning of Duan Qirui's death, originally intended to return to the country to offer condolences in person, but his leave request was not approved. Therefore, he sent his wife back to the country to represent him in offering condolences. He plans to return to the country when Duan's state funeral is held. Mrs. Xu carried many handwritten letters from Xu to important figures in Beijing and Shanghai, a portion of which was delivered by Huang Bodu yesterday morning. Mrs. Xu, having not returned to the country for a long time, plans to stay in Shanghai for an extended period and will return to Japan with Ambassador Xu after he returns to the country. Huang plans to stay in the country for two or three weeks and will take the night train to Beijing tonight to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and report on the situation. Xu Shiying's eulogy for Duan is recorded as follows: "一生剛介·三造共和·定大難·决大疑·峙如泰山·渟如止水·晚節愈堅貞·莽莽乾坤能有幾、卅載論交·百年知己·言可坊·行可表·進思盡忠·退思補過·衷腸今割裂、茫茫人海更何之、" (A life of integrity, three times creating the Republic, resolving great difficulties and doubts, standing like Mount Tai, as still as stagnant water, his integrity growing stronger in his later years, how many are there like this in this vast universe? Thirty years of friendship, a century of knowing each other, his words are exemplary, his actions are a model, in advancement thinking of loyalty, in retirement thinking of making amends, my heart is now torn, where in this vast sea of humanity can I find another like him?)</p>
<h3>Waiter Training School; Truth About the Current Recruitment</h3>
<p>In order to clarify the waiter training school recruitment advertisement, the details are as follows: The organizers of the school are Mr. Lu and others, formerly of the International Hotel Waiter Training School. Mr. Lu felt that the waiters serving at the International Hotel were indeed superior to those who had not been trained. Their demeanor, speech, and manners were free of vulgarity and were not offensive to customers. Therefore, he believed that training was not only necessary for the hotel industry but also for other professions, as it could greatly benefit management in all aspects. Recently, due to the flourishing business of the International Hotel, the original number of waiters was insufficient, prompting the current recruitment and training. As there were also commissions from other hotels to train waiters, the future demand would not be limited to the International Hotel alone. Therefore, it was decided not to use the International Hotel name. Fearing that too many unqualified applicants would apply, the application fee was increased to five yuan to limit the number of applicants, but this fee would be deducted from the tuition fee in the future. The tuition fee of 100 yuan reportedly includes room, board, medical expenses, and other fees, so it cannot be considered high. Furthermore, the school strives to provide the best possible facilities to cultivate good habits in the waiters and eliminate all traces of simplicity. The training period is only three months. During these three months, the school focuses on character, then physical fitness, and finally knowledge. With good character and a healthy body, it is easier to make progress in knowledge. The test results will be used to determine future service performance. Those with excellent character and potential will be sent to commissioned organizations for practical training. Those with poor character and untrainable will be eliminated. It is also reported that Mr. Lu and others conducted another experiment, which yielded excellent results. They plan to continue training workers in various industries to cultivate talent, provide legitimate employment opportunities for the unemployed, and lay the foundation for the advancement of social enterprises. This is a great initiative for social vocational education in the city. The school's first recruitment was held on the 15th of this month. It is reported that few candidates passed. The school plans to continue recruiting more candidates, with classes scheduled to begin in early December. The school is located at 5511 Zhongshan Road, the former dormitory for waiters at the International Hotel. It is also reported that the school has officially registered with the municipal authorities to avoid misunderstandings among those who are unaware of the facts.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper yesterday, the news column of this city included a report about Da Guangming and other theaters refusing to show films celebrating birthdays, and also included the name of our theater among them.

Thus, what is written in your newspaper obviously does not conform to the facts. In order to avoid misunderstanding, please correct this.</p>

<h3>General Overview of the Fluctuations in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce in July and August of This Year (Continued) (No. 38 of the Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Bureau</p>
<p>3. The Opening of the Chinese and Western Cuisine Department of the Daxin Restaurant - The restaurant is located on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company and is operated by the Daxin Ballroom under contract from the Daxin Company. The ballroom then leased the Chinese cuisine department to Mr. Wang Weibiao, who serves as the general manager of the Chinese cuisine department, and Mr. Su Zhangyu is hired as the manager. All the equipment for the department is owned by the Daxin Ballroom. The department opened on the 28th, simultaneously with the Western cuisine department.</p>
<p>The following four major changes in the manufacturing industry in August can be listed:</p>
<p>1. The Opening of the Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing Company - The company was reorganized from the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Hongfeng Printing and Dyeing Company. After the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory declared its closure due to business losses, Mr. Han Chongqin and others raised funds to set up the Hongfeng Printing and Dyeing Company and rented all the machinery of the factory from the Jingfeng creditors. However, the conditions were not appropriate and were opposed by the shareholders and some of the creditors of the factory, so the deal did not materialize. Later this month, Mr. Han and others reached an agreement with both parties and signed a lease agreement, changing the original name of Hongfeng to Tongfeng. The paid-up capital is 60,000 yuan, and it is organized as a joint-stock company. Shareholder Han Changsheng is elected as the chairman of the board, and Han Chongqin is the manager. The company specializes in purchasing raw cloth for printing, dyeing, and sales. 2. The Opening of the Yuanyuan Xingji Milk Company - The company was transformed from the former Yuanyuan Farm. Since the farm was unable to repay its debts due to poor business performance, it was sealed up by the Jincheng Bank and was forced to liquidate in October of last year. All of its assets were auctioned off by the court. Mr. Hao Duoshi purchased it from the court, unsealed it, and changed its name to Yuanyuan Xingji Milk Company. The company is a joint-stock company and hired Mr. Cao Bentao to oversee everything. The company is quite large and well-equipped, with total assets worth 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Securities - Why are Public Bonds Being Sold Off in a Rush?</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market continued to decline. The long positions of major traders exited the market, showing signs of rushing to sell. Judging from its background, the Suiyuan War may expand. The bond market is trending downward, mostly due to the exit of long positions. The outflow of spot bonds is also considerable. The market price is still high, and it will be difficult to stabilize even with a rebound due to the scarcity of buyers. The morning opening saw various groups selling off. Long positions of the 22nd exited the market, first dumping their holdings. The 32nd and 35th also sold off a lot. The selling pressure on the floor was extremely high, and there were very few buyers. Only the 26th and 58th had some demand.

At the closing, short positions covered, and the 14th and 54th bought in a lot, uniformly rebounding by 5 cents to 10 cents to 30 cents. As a result, the market price uniformly continued to decline.

The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Floating Long Positions Take Profits – The Yarn Market Reverses – Major Traders Are Still Importing in This Month</h3>
<p>After rising for a day, the yarn market showed signs of a reversal and decline again yesterday. This was because the price was too high, customers' yarn sales were sluggish, and people's hearts were hit by the intense Suiyuan War. Floating long positions took profits, and the market reversed. However, major traders were still importing, and the rise in Osaka Sanpin yarn revived.</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Market Enters a Weak Path</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the trend was flat and weak due to the intense Suiyuan War and the decline in Osaka Sanpin yarn. After the second session, floating long positions exited the market, and the market price declined step by step. However, long positions continued to tighten and refused to let go, absorbing a huge amount. However, the sales of spot yarn were quite sluggish, and people's hearts were weak. As a result, the standard yarn market fell by 1.30 yuan to 1.90 yuan in each month compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon closing, the Osaka Sanpin yarn still rose, and the sentiment was strong, rebounding by several tenths of a cent. Then, as yarn transactions became sluggish and the price of Jincheng yarn fell, the market entered a weak path again. As a result, this month rose by 1.10 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far month rose by 30 to 40 cents.

<h3>Cotton Slightly Turns Soft</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but overseas American cotton has rebounded. Although the cotton production estimate has been reduced by 2 million piculs, it is still outside of 14 million piculs, so people's hearts are still ordinary. However, the need for cotton mills is developing, and both domestic and foreign factories are actively purchasing.</p>
<p>The Standard Cotton Market Steps Down by 30 to 40 Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, the prices for each month varied, rising or falling by 5 cents to 15 cents. Then, as the published estimate for this year's cotton production was reduced by 2 million piculs, but still outside of 14 million piculs, people's hearts were ordinary, and the selling pressure increased slightly. At the same time, the yarn market was weak. As a result, each month fell by 25 cents to 30 to 40 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. The opening in the afternoon was flat. Discussions in the market stated that Russian cotton production reportedly accounts for the third largest in the world, and most people were bearish on this. This amount is feared to be incorrect, and it is said to be the amount of seed cotton. However, although the world's cotton production is celebrating a bumper harvest, the American cotton futures are still firm and expensive. The closing remained normal. As a result, each month was similar to the previous day. The sellers were Hexing (5,800 piculs), Xincheng (2,800 piculs), Ruida (2,600 piculs), Meiji (3,800 piculs), Yongyu (2,300 piculs), Changyu (8,000 piculs), Fengtai (3,100 piculs), Renfeng (4,400 piculs), Dachangcheng (1,500 piculs), and Xiecheng (1,900 piculs). The buyers were Gengfeng (7,000 piculs), Jinchang (2,900 piculs), Yuanda (1,800 piculs), Taichang (4,800 piculs), Xiecheng (5,900 piculs), Xinchang (4,000 piculs), Yuanxingchang (3,000 piculs), Tongji (3,200 piculs), Juxing (3,200 piculs), Changhe (2,000 piculs), and Mingde (1,400 piculs). The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<h3>General Overview of the Second Estimate of National Cotton Production - Cotton Fields Increase, Cotton Production Decreases - But 6 Million More Than Last Year</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the second estimate of national cotton production for 1936 at 5:00 PM on November 16th as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area 345,862.422 "hectares"</p>
<p>Total 51,879,000 "Chinese mu"</p>
<p>Total 56,292,711 "Old System Mu"</p>
<p>Lint Production 8,468,644 "Metric Piculs"</p>
<p>Total 16,937.000 "Chinese Piculs"</p>
<p>Total 14,429,291 "Old System Piculs"</p>
<p>Wasted Field Area 543,130 "Hectares"</p>
<p>Total 81,000 "Chinese mu"</p>
<p>Total 88,400 "Old System Mu"</p>
<p>This estimate (1) is based on reports from 12 provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin, (2) is based on the cotton crop situation before November 10th, (3) The losses suffered by the cotton crops in various provinces before November 10th have been included in the calculation, (4) Each mu of cotton field in the "Old System Mu" is 60 square zhang in the Ministry of Works measurement, and each picul of cotton production in the "Old System Picul" is 100 jin on the Tianping scale.</p>
<p>A comparison of the cotton field production estimates of the Association over the years is shown below (the terms "hectares", "Chinese mu", "metric piculs", and "Chinese piculs" are not indicated in the table and text, all of which are "Old System Mu" and "Old System Picul")</p>
<p>The national cotton production situation was generally good this year. From the initial sowing stage to the time of the Association's first estimate, the climate was extremely suitable in both the Yangtze River cotton region and the Yellow River cotton region. Therefore, on the one hand, the cotton field area increased greatly, and on the other hand, the harvest was good. Therefore, the first estimate of the national production reached more than 16,379,000 piculs, with an average yield of almost 30 jin per mu, which is a rare bumper harvest in recent years. After the first estimate, the situation was still good at first. In the Yellow River basin, the timely rainfall was suitable, and the cotton plants developed well. In the Yangtze River region, only the salt reclamation area of Jiangsu suffered from rain and water disasters, but most of the region did not have the autumn wind and rain, and the sunny and warm weather was especially helpful for the growth of late flowers and late bolls. The cotton harvest still had the potential to continue to improve. Unexpectedly, this sunny and warm climate continued to extend for almost two months without rain. The cotton crops initially suffered from drought and eventually declared disaster. The national cotton region was almost the same. The typhoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were rare, which was greatly beneficial to the harvest, but the losses from the drought were probably not small. However, because Zhejiang received rain, it still made progress, and most of the rest of the regions reported reduced production. Due to the different severity of the drought, the reduction rates were slightly different. Sichuan Province was hit by both water and drought disasters in succession, and suffered particularly heavy losses. It is estimated that the national cotton field area is 96,292,712 mu, an increase of 1,251,646 mu compared to the first estimate, and the production is 14,439,291 piculs, a decrease of 1,939,903 piculs compared to the first estimate, but still an increase of 6,296,380 piculs compared to 1935. The average yield per mu is about 26 jin, a decrease of more than 3 jin compared to the first estimate, and an increase of more than 2 jin compared to the actual harvest last year, which is still the highest harvest in the last five years.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Shows a Firm and Rising Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a drop of 3 pounds to a rise of 1 pound. Most of the trading in the market was for long positions to take profits and hedge sales, and December terms were transferred to the far term. There were not many over-the-counter transactions, and both sides were evenly matched. The spot cotton prices were firm, and the cloth market was relatively sluggish. The American cotton situation was firm and rising. However, world cotton production increased. Although there was frost in the east, it was generally believed that the cotton harvest was over, which was insignificant. Later, the stock market and other commodity prices rose, and the industry actively bought in, pushing up the market price. Spot prices rose by 11 pounds, and futures prices rose by 11 to 15 pounds. Spot prices for British cotton fell by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 2 or 3 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to purchases by European exporters, but later weakened due to sales by speculators, long position profit-taking, and unfavorable news from Liverpool. Phergal fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Omra fell by 1.5 to 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 16th).</p>
<p>Phergal 157.50 down 0.75 27.80</p>
<p>March Term 158.00 0.40 17.90</p>
<p>Omra 196.00 2.50 34.80</p>
<p>March Term 194.75 1.50 34.60</p>
<p>Bai Luo Creek 215.25 2.00 38.20</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 17th was Bai Luo Creek at 217.5 rupees, up 2.25 rupees, Omra at 198 rupees, up 2 rupees, and Phergal at 159 rupees, up 1.9 rupees.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Exports from Rangoon</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 16th, the amount of cotton exported by buyers in Rangoon last week totaled 539 tons, of which 325 tons were to Kobe, 8 tons to Mawei, 71 tons to Osaka, and 54 tons to Nagasaki.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Rise Quite Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 17th, the three types of yarn futures rose by 1.90 yuan to 3.20 yuan, with the near month at 238 yuan and the far month at 212.80 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 40 cents to 95 cents, with the near month at 65.95 yuan and the far month at 66.79 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Flourishing Silk Market Will Soon Come to an End</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market clearly showed signs of a downturn. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange saw general declines. Day silk was averaging 83 and 75, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each fell by one point, far-term standard silk futures dropped by three and a half points, and near-term futures fell by as much as five points. Converted to Shanghai prices, each dan (unit of weight) of raw silk fell by over twenty yuan. Yokohama silk prices also saw a slight correction, with spot prices down two yuan and futures down twelve yuan. The Lyon silk market, however, was relatively firm, with Japanese silk and Shanghai silk of the B grade rising slightly, and the rest remaining at their original prices. The Shanghai silk market is currently experiencing a slowdown in foreign sales due to the low prices abroad and excessively harsh price limits. The silk market, which has been flourishing for over a month, may now be coming to an end. Domestic silk sales were also very sparse yesterday, but fortunately, trading prices remained unchanged. A total of sixty bales of white filature and other silks were sold throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Demand is Strongest in Sichuan and Yunnan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to be strong. Domestic yarn and cotton prices were stable, and top-grade American cotton all showed increases. Market sentiment was extremely robust, and the prices of various goods for sale were all very firm. Actual sales gradually developed, with the Southwest regions being the best. Yesterday, merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan continued to purchase over 300 pieces of goods, including in-color goods, printed velvet, khaki drill, sheeting, linen cloth, serge, twill, white fine cloth, and coarse cloth. However, goods from Fujian Province saw little activity. Previously ordered low-priced goods were gradually being delivered, but shipments were not surging. Some goods have already been resold in Shanghai, likely because the markets in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces are difficult to turn around. Actual demand in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui Provinces continues to be strong. Sales in Zhejiang Province, including Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Hengyan, and other places, are recovering, but Quzhou and Taizhou remain stagnant. Merchants from Shaanxi and Henan Provinces are gradually seeing opportunities, with most purchases being serge, straight tribute cloth, linen cloth, and white flannel. White goods from Tianjin merchants remain stagnant. Yesterday, there were quite a few purchases of colored goods, with transactions including eighty bolts of Junzi serge and over thirty cases of linen cloth from various Chinese factories. The most active business on this street is still flannel.</p>
<h3>Grain: Actual Sales are Stagnant, Fluctuations in Futures of Flour and Wheat are Very Small</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, prices for all months initially seemed stable. Due to the quotations for foreign wheat, with Chicago rising about 3 to 4 cents and Canada rising 1.0 cent, the opening prices caused a slight tremor in market sentiment. Near-term months were slightly better, while far-term months were slightly better by 1 to 2 cents. However, local factories, due to sluggish actual sales, were expected to sell off far-term contracts, causing the market to soften again. The situation for this month to March was similar to the previous day, while April saw a slight decrease of 0.5 cent. By the afternoon opening, trading became quiet, and prices for all months tended to be stagnant. Speculation was difficult to exploit, and grain prices in various regions were also stagnant. Buyers are naturally adopting a wait-and-see approach. Unless there are special changes, it is expected that prices will fluctuate within a narrow range.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw very little fluctuation in prices for various months in the morning. Although foreign wheat continued to perform well, due to the scarcity of buyers and the cautious approach of sellers, both sides were reluctant to engage, leading to quiet trading. Although foreign wheat prices were not favorable, compared to domestic rice prices, wheat prices were already on par. Looking back at the facts, this caused buyers to hesitate. By the afternoon opening, trading remained slow. Near-term months were slightly softer, while far-term months were stable. Looking ahead, it is feared that prices will fluctuate for a while. The wheat market remains calm, with very little fluctuation. High-quality wheat from Wuhe Yaowan opened at 8.05 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 5.93 yuan, and Nanjing Dongtai wheat from the whole city at 5.85 yuan, with a total of over 10,000 bags offered.</p>
<h3>Soybeans are Entirely Controlled by Dalian</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market situation has been entirely manipulated by Dalian. The speed of fluctuations in the Dalian market from day to day is so rapid that the market's atmosphere makes it impossible for buying and selling to respond to each other. This causes procurement to be hesitant, with only sporadic inquiries. Total transactions in the market are less than 1,000 bags, and oil extraction plants are unwilling to pay high prices. The future trend is unlikely to be prosperous.</p>
<h3>Observations of National Products and Nanyang Commerce Delegation</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The position of national products in Nanyang has been declining in recent years, almost without the prosperity of the past. This is because the domestic industrial sector has not paid attention to it, while Europe, America, and Japan, relying on their superior forces, have encroached and seized market share, and their influence has grown. Nanyang and national products can no longer be a combined term.</p>
<p>In July of this year, the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association organized the Nanyang Business Observation Delegation. With products from 37 factories, under the leadership of Director Gao and Hu, they went to various places in Nanyang, such as the Philippines, Singapore, Batavia, Penang, Medan, Surabaya, Siam, and Saigon, for a period of four months, covering a distance of over ten thousand miles. They returned to the country yesterday, with great success and reputation. All sectors warmly welcomed them to commend all members of the delegation at sea, which was a grand event. The five members believe that the Nanyang Business Observation Delegation gained a lot. The most outstanding ones are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To show people the true picture of national products, so that compatriots understand the progress of national products over the years, which is indeed not to be underestimated, and to evoke the enthusiasm of Nanyang compatriots to use national products. It is reported that the National Products Exhibition held has more than 10,000 visitors every day, leaving a very good impression on the people of Nanyang.</p>
<p>(2) The power of this visit is the greatest for the emotional connection between domestic manufacturers and Nanyang compatriots. Not only does it connect the feelings of compatriots, but also the feelings between governments in various places have become connected, eliminating the past drawbacks of isolation. This time, the entire delegation received grand receptions and welcomes from local governments and local Chinese merchants wherever they went. This has never happened before, and the gentlemen of the Observation Delegation have successfully achieved their effect.</p>
<p>(3) To gain the trust of compatriots in the motherland. Compatriots see that the products of the motherland are so excellent, and the leaders of the industrial sector have such talent, and a passion arises spontaneously, leading to purchases and orders, and they are willing to act as distributors, and even want to set up China National Products Companies and introduction offices, to cooperate sincerely with domestic partners. This kind of loving and sincere attitude is unprecedented since the beginning of Nanyang trade, and it is also a credit to the gentlemen of the Observation Delegation.</p>
<p>Based on these three points, we respectfully predict with twelve points of enthusiasm that the future of national products in Nanyang has unlimited prospects.</p>

<p>"Selecting and hiring female interviewers to go to homes for conversations, to discuss with housewives the common knowledge of identifying national products, and to inquire about the criticisms of various housewives regarding various national products, so as to inform manufacturers to improve."</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the interviews issued by our association - the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation before dispatching us to homes.</p>
<p>Now, the home visit work has begun for two weeks. Although we have to encounter many hard and soft nails every day, sometimes we use all kinds of methods and cannot open the door of the housewife; although due to the economic downturn and the "imbalance of education level," we will everywhere be obstructed by bad ideas such as "the fundraisers are here again," "it must be a female swindler," "the pushy salesmen are here," etc. In fact, we have broken through many difficulties. Our work can not be said to be advancing under relatively smooth conditions.</p>
<p>Our work is arduous, but we have gained supreme joy and supreme reward in our work!</p>
<p>What is the reward we get? It is the emotional hospitality of the general housewives, the resonance of our hearts. Listen, are they not saying:</p>
<p>"We are all Chinese, and Chinese blood flows in our veins. National crisis cannot be said to have reached the endpoint, and buying foreign goods is such a cruel and unreasonable thing!"</p>
<p>Not only that, but more worth remembering are the housewives' suggestions for the National Products Movement. Yes, according to the purpose of the interview, the faithful opinions of the housewives are worth sincerely accepting and improving. Only in this way can the National Products Movement progress and the National Products market have the possibility of leaping forward. Combining their conversations, we can offer the following two valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>1. Establish a National Products Consultation Center.</p>
<p>Establishing a National Products Consultation Center is a major issue, but the reason is very simple. Because home visits are only short-term work, the maximum effect is only to give housewives a good impression for a short time. In order to maintain the power of the visit work permanently, we can only establish National Products Consultation Centers in the central locations of various districts in this city, so that housewives in each district can come to consult nearby. Because everyone knows that they should love and use national products, but there are some unscrupulous merchants who have lost their conscience and are greedy for short-term profits, and often use foreign goods to counterfeit national products, so that people who buy national products cannot distinguish the authenticity, and often go to buy goods happily, but after careful examination, the result is a fake foreign product, or even inferior goods. At this time, a piece of enthusiasm is exchanged for a stomach full of sadness! Therefore, the establishment of National Products Consultation Centers in various districts can not only provide consultation for housewives, but also promote new national products in a timely manner for housewives to use. Therefore, it is a very important work.</p>
<p>2. The Necessity of Establishing National Products Companies in Various Districts.</p>
<p>Indeed, we already have large-scale National Products Companies, which are sufficient for patriots to choose and buy national products. However, daily necessities are mostly added to the family temporarily. It is not very reliable to seek them in general stores. If you go to Nanjing Road and other places to buy them, it is inevitable that it will be inconvenient and costly. If obvious National Products Companies can be established in various districts, even on larger roads (the size does not matter), so that the general housewives can clearly know that they are national products, and because of the convenience, they will inevitably buy from National Products Companies, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>The above suggestions can only be said to be very general opinions, as for the specific methods, they need to be developed and supported by the advanced members of the National Products community and the ladies and gentlemen of the society!</p>
<h3>The Four "Musts" for Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Promoting national products is the unanimous cry of all enlightened people in the country in recent years. However, in my opinion, the reason why the achievements in promoting national products have not been 120% significant is that the general compatriots have not been able to practice the four "must" principles. What are the four "must" principles? Please see below:</p>
<p>(1) Must Gladly Use National Products: It is a matter of course and an undeniable fact that Chinese people should use Chinese goods. We should have an attitude of being happy to buy and use national products. Whether it is the smallest needle or the consumption of a piece of paper, whenever national products are available, we should always give priority to buying and using national products. If everyone has this spirit of being happy to use national products, the future of the national products industry will naturally develop rapidly and reach a successful state.</p>
<p>(2) Must Forgive National Products: Some people say: "It's not that I don't want to use Chinese goods, but in reality, compared to non-national products, there is a difference in substance. For the sake of durability, I have to reluctantly buy foreign goods. It's not that I'm happy to use foreign goods, it's really a last resort." People with this attitude are probably not a small number in today's society. I think we should have an attitude of forgiving national products. Although there may be a difference in substance compared to other products, we should still be happy to buy and use them because these are our Chinese national products, and forgive them. With this spirit of forgiving national products, foreign goods will fundamentally not be able to be dumped in large quantities in the Chinese market, and China's economic crisis will naturally have a day of salvation.</p>
<p>(3) Must Urge National Products: Promoting national products should not only be about consumption, and should also try to use them as much as possible, but also actively improve the production sector in order to reach perfection. For general national products that we think need to be improved, we should sincerely offer suggestions to the national products production sector, urging them to find ways to improve. If we can do this, the substance of national products will have the possibility of progress and will be happily used by consumers.</p>
<p>(4) Must Recognize National Products: Finally, let's talk about the issue of recognizing national products. Currently, there are many people who mistakenly purchase foreign goods and counterfeit goods because they do not recognize national products. This is something that should be remedied. Therefore, we should go to national products exhibitions as much as possible to increase our knowledge and ability to identify national products. For example, the National Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is currently in progress, and it is well worth a visit for compatriots who do not know much about national products.</p>
<p>Brief News: Since the pseudo-Mongolian bandit army attacked Suiyuan Province, the situation in the northern border has suddenly become tense. It is now reported that General Fu Zuoyi is directing the battle. However, the soldiers on the front line are serving the country in this icy and snowy environment, and their supplies are in urgent need of assistance from the rear. The owner of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory in this city, in view of this situation, in addition to gathering all the employees of the factory to donate a large sum of money, which was remitted to the front line through this newspaper, also donated 2,000 pairs of Warrior athletic shoes, which were also transferred by this newspaper. It is hoped that major companies and factories will follow suit, and the soldiers fighting on the front line will feel grateful.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Fan Xianwei)</p>
<p>There are two kinds of faces in the world that are the most difficult to look at, except for the dying patient on the sickbed and the blood of the death row inmate waiting to be shot on the execution ground: one is the face of a wealthy person who is puffing out their chest and belly, the face of a person who gains property and a debt collector - the other is the face of a poor person who is hunching over and stooping - the face of an unemployed person and a person who is borrowing money. The former's every word and deed reveals an arrogant attitude, and it is necessary to take advantage of everything in every way, making people angry - the latter is absolutely the opposite, revealing a cramped and uneasy state everywhere, with flattering smiles, doing everything possible, with the feeling of "suffering a loss now is a small matter, I only hope that the other party will be lenient", making people feel disgusted when they see it!</p>
<p>Opportunity is like the wind in the sky, and people are like the sails on a ship. If there is wind but no sails are raised, you are giving up your rights. If there are sails but no wind, there is naturally no way. This all depends on the captain's own discretion. However, even if the wind is good, the most common mistake is to have the sails set too full. It's better to give up one or two points! That way it will be fast and stable, otherwise, if a gust of wind hits, the mast will break and the boat will capsize, which is not good. If you ask where the opportunity is? You don't have to look far, it's worthless, it's just the four words "seize the reality"!</p>
<h3>"Picking Up Fallen Cotton"</h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>The story of "Daiyu Burying Flowers" in "Dream of the Red Chamber" has been passed down as a beautiful story by later generations. Other things like "counting fallen flowers," "sweeping fallen flowers," and "chanting fallen flowers" are all the leisure and elegance of noble hermits, worthy of people's envy. But the "picking up fallen cotton" mentioned here, the flowers are not the kind of peony, peony, hibiscus and other flowers that are only for people to admire, and their picking up fallen cotton is definitely not the leisure and elegance used by noble hermits to pass the time, but comes from the drive of hunger and cold. It turns out that the flowers are cotton, and those who are engaged in picking up fallen cotton are those hungry people who have no way to maintain their lives!</p>
<p>It's that time again, and the scene of picking up fallen cotton reappears in my mind after meeting someone from my hometown. Originally, the farmers in the countryside, of course, collect the cotton in their fields very carefully, but no matter how careful they are, they will inevitably leave some remnants or late-blooming cotton there, and the farmers are not willing to spend any more effort to pick them up. Therefore, at that time, the general poor people in the countryside usually sent out all the men and women of the family to engage in the work of picking up fallen cotton (also called "picking up fallen flowers"): they used their sharp eyes, meticulous observation, agile wrists, and quick steps to pick up the fallen flowers that are not easily seen by ordinary people, that have been eaten by insects or attached to dry leaves. In this way, the fallen flowers they pick up all day, when plentiful, can also get three or five pounds: then they add a procedure of removing dirt and sorting the fallen flowers picked up by the family during this period, and take the better ones to the market to exchange for money and rice, and the damaged ones are made into cotton wool for warmth. In this way, they have solved part of their hunger and cold problems, so they often say to people: "We are not picking up fallen cotton, we are saving our lives." Fortunately, in the past, the landlords did not interfere very much with this kind of behavior.</p>
<p>But in recent years, it has been different. The landlords themselves are also threatened by hunger and cold. How can they be willing to let people pick up all their fallen cotton? So, on the one hand, they prohibit those who pick up fallen cotton from entering their fields, and on the other hand, they do the work of picking up fallen cotton themselves. Therefore, the poor people in the countryside now have no way to save their lives - fallen cotton. Alas!</p>
<h3>Ivory Soap</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>My neighbor, Mr. Chen, lost his elegant seal script and given name many years ago, and is always called "Ivory Soap". Mr. Chen himself admits that this respected name is true to its name. Before the restoration, he had served as a patrol inspector, and after the restoration, he had also held the title of some kind of councilor. Therefore, he is not a first-class country gentleman here, but at least he is a respectable Mr. Official. The thing that he usually thinks is painful and often puts on his lips is that during his tenure as a patrol inspector, he spent a few taels of silver on a birthday gift to celebrate the birthday of the county magistrate's concubine, only to get a meal and a day of running around. Although he later received a reward of "Officer Chen handles affairs diligently," he always felt that this was an unprecedented waste of money in his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen likes friends. On the road, even though he wears reading glasses, he always smiles broadly and nods repeatedly. Therefore, some people call him "Jian Shenqu" - seeing people he's crooked. He especially likes visiting friends in restaurants and hotels. In fact, Mr. Chen's alcohol capacity is very small. Four taels of Dushao is enough to make his face red and his ears hot, but his meat capacity is not small. A standard pig's trotter skin can be rolled up and eaten all at once. He always boasts: "I have too many friends. I have to eat and drink for at least five or six years for three meals a day." This is definitely not his boasting. We often see him drunk, oily, and very satisfied wandering on the road.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is very frugal. He likes simple people, whether he knows them or not, he always politely says hello based on old accounts. But he must personally attend to congratulate or condole. At the table, he always likes to sit at the same table with children. He said: "Children are the most innocent and innocent." He loves to eat pig's trotter skin the most, so he always points his bamboo chopsticks at the pig's trotter and shouts "The trotter wants to be sealed," and then he rolls it up and eats it all at once. So, some people call him "Trotter Sealer".</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has no wife or children. In addition to socializing and drinking, most of his time every day is spent in teahouses, and he is an old tea customer regardless of the size of the teahouse. When he steps into the teahouse, he scans the whole hall with his eyes under his glasses. In his nodding and smiling voice, he will find tea friends. Therefore, some people respectfully call him Patrol - Tea - Censor.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chen sometimes loudly calls out: "I am ultimately ivory soap, and I have encountered an all-pervasive iron scrub brush, which is why I make you feel annoyed"!</p>
<p>Switching Phoenixes</p>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Swearing Allegiance with a Cup of Water, Talking About Weariness Under a Green Lamp, Red Beans Reporting Longing with Golden Lines</p>
<p>Youmei slowly sat on the chair beside her, propped her head with her hand, lowered her eyelids, thought for a while, and then smiled: Although I have not experienced this kind of situation, I am thinking carefully that if I were you, my mood must be like this, and I can't simply talk about what's in my heart. Because you are much more stable and thorough than me. At this time, you are so overwhelmed that you can't control yourself. Can a careless person like me find a clue? Menglan said: That's your wrong observation. A generous person like you can't be as indecisive as me, so you won't be in such an incurable situation. For yourself, you would have thought of a solution long ago. Youmei was already holding her chin with both hands upward, staring at the roof, and nodding her head: Of course, I am not willing to sacrifice under the old etiquette. However, my family is not much better than yours. Alas! It would be better for us to be born twenty years earlier or twenty years later, but we were born in a transitional era. As if we were endowed with freedom, but we couldn't get free. Menglan did not take up his words, and sighed even more deeply. Just at this time, she heard the stairs ringing, and Menglan shook her hands at Youmei twice. Xiaoju followed outside the door and shouted: Miss, I'm outside the door, am I called or not? I put my fingers in my ears, so I can't hear what you're saying. Youmei said: Xiaoju, are you still plugging your ears now? Xiaoju didn't say anything? Youmei said: Why don't you say anything? This girl is so bold. Xiaoju said: I promised, didn't I hear Li Xia say something without plugging my ears? Youmei said: You are speaking now, did you hear what I said after all? Xiaoju smiled and jumped in, plugging her ears with two index fingers and smiled: Miss Li, look, look, did I plug my ears? Menglan sighed: Xiaoju, your fate is better than mine. You are carefree and don't know anything. We have studied books for more than ten years, and we are not as good as you at all. Xiaoju pursed her mouth and said: That's the world turned upside down, and the lady is not as good as the maid? I know, Miss, you are complaining again. Her hands were already down, not plugging her ears, and pointing at the tip of her nose with her right index finger, and pointing at Youmei with a smile: Miss Li told our madam that she will definitely persuade our miss to change her mind. You told me not to tell you, my miss treats me well, I can't help but tell you. These words made both Mei and Lan laugh endlessly. (99)</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Art</h3>
<p>— Lang Luxun</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Minyi has been studying painting for more than twenty years. She left school long ago and is now a housewife in charge, a mother to a child. She can no longer immerse all her energy and time in painting as she did in school. Inevitably, like other women, she is burdened with household chores, the trivialities of family life occupy her, but she does not neglect her art. Amidst her household duties, she continues to work hard at her studies. I have seen how many talented women have been buried in the environment of their families, which always makes me lament their future! Today, Ms. Zhou fundamentally refutes the notion of women's dormitories. Looking at Ms. Zhou's large body of work over the years, it further proves to us that women in families do not necessarily have their talents completely submerged.</p>
<p>The attitude of women pursuing art is that they do not regard art as a pastime but as a career. She has even greater artistic aspirations, spending her days with palette and paintbrush as close friends, day after day for twenty years. Unfortunately, a serious blow came suddenly. The ruthless artillery fire of the "January 28th Incident" burned Ms. Zhou's accumulated drafts almost completely. Even the books and pictures she usually collected were buried in the fire. Unexpectedly, such a major blow not only failed to destroy Ms. Zhou's ambition, but after the "January 28th Incident," she turned adversity into acceptance, reorganized her artistic endeavors, and has been even more diligent in recent years than before. Although the quantity of her paintings is not as much as before, the quality has clearly taken on a new form. Those beautiful lines, gentle and beautiful colors, and deeply touching expressions undoubtedly give me the recognition that they come from the pen of an artist who has been tempered by blows and is even stronger.</p>
<p>This time, Ms. Zhou's friends repeatedly encouraged her to carefully select more than a hundred oil paintings from her works after the "January 28th Incident" and hold a solo exhibition in Shanghai. I am writing these few words specifically as an introduction, hoping that Ms. Zhou will continue her past spirit of pursuing art, redouble her efforts, and make great contributions to the art world in the future, shining like a rare and magnificent comet among the stars.</p>
<h3>The Pleasure of Sight and Sound</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Since autumn, there has been no rain, and the chrysanthemums have been severely affected. Even with all the efforts of the Ju Ju family in irrigation, it is still not enough. A few days ago, the heavens finally sent down some timely rain, and the chrysanthemums burst into bloom. Chrysanthemum exhibitions in the Shanghai area are springing up everywhere, too numerous to count. "Guan Nong" in Caojing, West Shanghai, has risen to prominence at the right time, inviting guests to admire the flowers. As I live nearby, I couldn't help but go and take a look.</p>
<p>"Guan Nong" has planted three thousand pots of chrysanthemums. It was also a sensation last year on this day. This time, they have collaborated with the famous "Xiao Guan Yuan," known for its chrysanthemum cultivation, and there are also goldfish on display, making it even grander. Around the "Song Mei" variety, which is entering the competition, are many "Standing Chrysanthemums," with hundreds of flowers on one plant, which is very spectacular. In Wangmei Pavilion, more than ten pots of carefully cultivated fine varieties are arched high, each branch standing tall and gracefully charming. On the walls hang more than twenty pieces of calligraphy and painting by famous masters from the Qing Dynasty, which are truly treasures, from the collection of the famous doctor Qu Zhibu, not marked with prices, entirely for people to enjoy.</p>
<p>On the large lawn in the corner of the bronze lion, chrysanthemums are piled into mountains, and the style is also very beautiful, as tall as the house, making it even more magnificent. The walls of the Green Shade Thatched Cottage are hung with calligraphy and paintings by contemporary artists, such as Zhang Yuguang's Crane, Zhu Dake's inscription, Han Guojun's running script couplet, Jin Liang's ancient seal script couplet, and Qian Shoutie's combined brocade painted screen, all of which are worthy of praise, totaling nearly a hundred pieces, while the rest are mediocre.</p>
<p>A long field is planted with five-colored "Baby's Breath," which is also quite spectacular from a distance. According to Manager Xi, in recent days, many customers who have admired the chrysanthemums have spent money to buy them, with dozens of cases happening every day, and trucks can't deliver them all in time, showing that people who are fascinated by elegance are not saving money despite the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Goldfish are also placed in pots on the grass, with clear and easy-to-read labels, and there are as many as twenty or thirty varieties!</p>
<p>After admiring the chrysanthemums, I was invited by Zhuang Meisheng to a restaurant to eat crabs. Suddenly, on the way, I met Tang Jun Xiumei, and we went to the Empire Theater to appreciate Bai Yushuang's newly staged Ping opera "The West Chamber."</p>
<p>Outside the Pengpeng Theater, friends have often argued about how such-and-such a performer is, but I had never listened to them. Today, after watching Bai's West Chamber, it is not much different from the Peking opera version. I asked Tang, and he said that there was originally no such play in Ping opera, and it was newly adapted from Peking opera. Bai is so charming that it's no wonder so many people are captivated.</p>
<p>In deep autumn, my thoughts are mixed. Stealing half a day of leisure is indeed a great pleasure for the eyes and ears. How can I not record it?</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Female Waitresses in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>A friend who strolls around entertainment venues, using their nickname "Glass Cup," talked about the female waitresses of Shanghai. There were indeed some unforgettable and romantic anecdotes in my memory. The first entertainment venue in Shanghai to employ female waitresses was the Paradise World. At that time, the female waitresses of Paradise World were all recruited through examinations. After being selected, they underwent considerable training before being assigned to serve in various tea halls. In terms of appearance, some of the female waitresses in Paradise World were indeed not bad. Dressed in uniform clothing, they served tea to the tourists, shuttling back and forth like weavers. In addition to the female waitresses, the tea managers and cashiers in each tea hall of Paradise World were also young women. Of course, they were relatively knowledgeable and had received considerable education. Later, although it deteriorated year by year, compared to other entertainment venues, the female waitresses of Paradise World were still a cut above the rest!</p>
<p>The Paradise World venue was small and had few recreational activities, but for a period, it caused quite a stir among many tourists, which was due to the appeal of the female waitresses. At that time, in this city of Shanghai, there were many wandering bees and butterflies whose hearts were not in the tea. They went to Paradise World for the female waitresses. There were even many college students who had romantic affairs with female waitresses. If they took a fancy to a female waitress, they would go to drink tea every day. In fact, a cup of tea was only two cents, but they would give a dollar, two dollars, or even five or ten dollars. In this kind of evil environment, many female waitresses were naturally tempted by money. As a result, female waitresses became a kind of woman who sold their bodies, although there were some who were clean and refused to be tempted.</p>
<p>Since the dance craze became popular in Shanghai, it seems that fewer people were interested in female waitresses. Now, with the advent of the economic downturn, the whole of Shanghai has become very depressed, and all industries have been greatly affected. Female waitresses are naturally no exception. The golden age has long passed, and the wealthy who would give one or two dollars for a pot of tea are long gone. Although every entertainment venue still hires female waitresses, it is only as a decoration.</p>
<h3>From the First Edition to the Fourth Edition of "Traces of Fragrance"</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>From the first edition of this book published as a separate volume, it has been less than seven months, and it is actually going to be reprinted for the fourth edition. Many good friends have congratulated me for this, thinking it is a very honorable thing. I won't say any false words; of course, I also feel very gratified. However, in the publishing world at home and abroad, books that go from the first edition to the fourth edition within half a year are not uncommon and are not worth mentioning. Moreover, the statistics show that there are only seven or eight thousand copies, not even reaching ten thousand. Such sales figures are really not enough to be called huge.</p>
<p>To go a step further, because I am the translator of this book, I am naturally the person who knows its contents most clearly. So, if someone asked me, "Do you hope that this book will be published in the fifth and sixth editions?" I would definitely answer, "No, I don't." This is not because I have already sold the copyright of this book to Shenbao, and I have no personal benefit, but because the content of this book, apart from having very delicate and profound descriptions of all people, things, and objects, and being easy to make people laugh, really has no great value. Especially at this critical juncture when the national crisis is deepening day by day, and the survival of the nation is about to be judged in the near future, I think that the reading materials needed by the public should be works full of stimulation and bloodiness, definitely not this kind of thing!</p>
<p>When this book was published in Shenbao on a daily basis, the media and critics had repeatedly commented or corrected it. After the publication of the separate volume, in theory, I should have sent this book to all parties to ask for guidance. However, because I have been very depressed in recent years, closed my doors to guests, and rarely socialized, and I dare not call myself a writer, I have never asked any major writers for advice on this book. For this reason, in the past half year, I have not seen a single gentleman who has given me a complete and satisfactory critique. What I have seen are only two kinds of writing: one is to attack forcefully based on facts, and the other is to casually select a paragraph of facts and reprint it. I think both of these attitudes are wrong. The former is to criticize a novel from the perspective of a historian, which is inevitably too serious, and the latter is to praise a literary work with the means of promoting a celebrity, which is inevitably too excessive. Because the strength of this book is definitely not the truthfulness of narration, so textual research is unnecessary, and reprinting is also meaningless.</p>
<p>Now that the fourth edition is about to be published, I sincerely hope that all the gentlemen or ladies who have already read this book can give me some valuable criticism. (Please send the manuscript to this journal.)</p>

<h3>The Sins of a Deformed Society: ... The Origin and Solution of Gonorrhea and Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Y.U. Duncun, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan, Physician Chen Minbo</p>
<p>... The groundbreaking mixed treatment of gonorrhea is the greatest medical invention in Europe in nearly a century ... Its prestige has spread throughout the world, and most clinicians are vying to use it for its unparalleled therapeutic value ... The state has awarded medals to reward it greatly, and there are also methods for treating gonorrhea externally for both men and women</p>
<p>In today's capitalist society, many deformed developments are enough to hinder human happiness. The development of prostitution and the establishment of dance halls are truly the source of human sin and the trap for the fall of youth. All venereal diseases are undoubtedly transmitted from this!</p>
<p>Since syphilis and chancroid have appropriate treatments, gonorrhea, which has been regarded as the most difficult to cure since ancient times, has become the most important problem in the medical community today. Or, local treatment is performed by transmembranous sterilization, but repeated failures have long proven its ineffectiveness. Therefore, whether gonorrhea can be cured is a question that ordinary men and women patients urgently want to know when gonorrhea is rampant and rampant!</p>
<p>The human hope for gonorrhea treatment has finally been realized and has achieved unprecedented success in medicine! This is because Dr. Mayer M.D.'s theory of increasing cell prototypes has been applied to the treatment of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>The theory is to take animal and plant fats and lipoids and apply them to the human body to promote the patient's anti-gonorrhea factors to eliminate the gonococcus and eradicate its roots, and to increase the vitality of the patient's cells, so that the tissue necrosis of the affected areas such as the urethra, prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymitis can be restored as soon as possible; and normal fertility can be restored. Other symptoms caused by gonorrhea, such as spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation, can also be quickly cured! This effective treatment is only the latest original "Kelinong"! Because "Kelinong" is made of lipoids and lipoids (proteins), it is effective for men and women with gonorrhea, whether acute or chronic, men with spermatorrhea with blood, and women with cervicitis and leukorrhea. Taking "Kelinong" will quickly obtain complete and good results and eradicate the roots forever. However, for women with leukorrhea, it is recommended to use "Kaerxuedi" externally as a suppository at the same time. As for the external treatment methods for gonorrhea in men and women, there is the latest German-made "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva", which can be used externally by men and women to wash the vagina or urethra, making it easier to drain the pus and turbidity inside the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>British Docetur and French gonorrhea expert Dr. Delbet have both confirmed the special effect of "Kelinong" and "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva" in treating gonorrhea. This company has also won the medal of the Royal Hospital.</p>
<p>Sexual Stories</p>
<h3>The Bomb of Love Between the Sexes</h3>
<p>— Physician Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>The Harm of the Fruit of Wisdom</p>
<p>Even if you are obedient to your wife, you still cannot get the comfort of love because the youth gland tissue is damaged, resulting in this unfortunate outcome.</p>
<p>Since Adam and Eve mistakenly ate the devil's fruit of wisdom, the seeds of love have been planted between men and women, and this seed is our human sexual desire. With sexual desire, there can be love affairs. This is how mankind has continued. So today, many tragedies that occur between the sexes are due to the harm of the fruit of wisdom. In fact, this is just the words of theologians. From our medical standpoint, the love between the sexes is really built on sexual desire, and the origin of sexual desire is the youth gland. Many young people who are developing, because they are stimulated by hormones and induced by the outside world, develop the bad habit of masturbation, or because they are not fully developed, and they have early marriage and excessive sexual desire, they damage the youth glands. The sexual nerves suddenly fall into a state of weakness, resulting in incomplete development, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, and erectile dysfunction. If a person suffers from the above symptoms, they must not get married. If they get married without knowing their own limitations, because of sexual dissatisfaction, the wife will always fall into the abyss of pain, and the husband will not be able to win his wife's sympathy even if he is obedient. Alas! Masturbation is really a bomb of love!</p>
<p>But this kind of sorrow for men is just a thing of the past. Now, because there is the "Butikon" invented by the German Meren, this agent is made of hormones from brave animals. It can cure youth gland weakness, small genitals, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence caused by masturbation or excessive sexual desire in five or six weeks. Since I graduated from the Medical School of the Russian Labor University and returned to China, I have cured it with this agent since I started my practice. A certain young man surnamed Fang, who was 22 years old, was less than five feet tall and had sexual neurasthenia. He was ridiculed by his wife. He was so angry that he wanted to die. After I introduced him to take "Butikon" for two months, he achieved normal development. Another person used Nais spermatorrhea tablets to treat spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Nursing</p>
<h3>According to Science, the Best Way to Eliminate Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Written by B.I.Iasinsky, Translated by Physician Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>... In the midst of the economic downturn, how can people with lung disease spend this long day ... You must recognize this most economical and effective treatment to quickly restore health</p>
<p>The lungs themselves have no sense of awareness, so patients are completely unaware of the internal changes in the lungs, no matter how far the disease has progressed. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis often have cavities inside that are inches in diameter, but they are completely unaware of it. Those with weak resistance only feel cough, phlegm, fever, fatigue, and even hemoptysis, etc., and at first, they cannot know whether there are any lesions in the lungs.</p>
<p>As for the stinging sensation in the chest, it is only pleurisy pain, not related to the lungs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the recuperation of lung disease requires a long period of time until the fever subsides and</p>
<p>All the phlegm is gone</p>
<p>Only then can we rest assured that it is cured, and we can believe that the inside has indeed scabbed over. This matter is very important for patients with early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis and those suspected of having tuberculosis. Because early-stage patients often cannot endure long-term recuperation. Or, when there is a risk of hidden pulmonary tuberculosis in a cold and cough, they do not pay attention to it, and it is too late to regret it.</p>
<p>Until hemoptysis</p>
<p>Checking today's latest and most effective treatment for lung disease in Europe lies in compressing the relaxation of the lungs, slowing down blood circulation and lymphatic circulation, thereby preventing the supply of oxygen. As a result, tubercle bacilli die one after another due to lack of oxygen, and are ultimately completely eliminated,</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is cured</p>
<p>This has been seen in practice! For example, artificial pneumothorax is based on this principle. And the theory and practical effect of the internal medicine drug "Pulmonal" are also based on this point. Therefore, the efficacy of woody agents</p>
<p>Exceeds everything</p>
<p>After taking it, you can reduce fever and stop bleeding, concentrate phlegm, drink sweat and increase food. If you have neurasthenia, insomnia, and spermatorrhea, you should also take "Butikon" for men or "Bunurong" for women.</p>
<h3>The Terrible Female Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>... There is a risk of becoming hysterical, ... She is the most restless patient in the family.</p>
<p>Women usually develop earlier than men, for reasons that are nothing more than endocrine-related. However, many women do not fully develop due to parents forcing them to marry, or bad partners inducing self-pollution. Places such as the breasts and buttocks all stop developing halfway. In particular, neurasthenia is the most terrible. And irregular menstruation, white discharge, infertility after marriage, backache, cold knees, insomnia, palpitations, and slow movements, her demeanor also becomes thin and yellow due to irregular menstruation, anemia, and reduced fat. People who suffer from these symptoms are always disliked by family members, so their spirits feel even more depressed, pessimistic, and lead to hysteria, which is a major blow to harmonious and happy families.</p>
<p>I remember that after I graduated from Nantong Medical University in the past, I always used the German drug "Bunurong" to fundamentally solve this problem, because this agent is made of hormones, which can adjust the abnormality of ovarian function, so that menstruation tends to be smooth, and because the hormone in the body is greatly increased, the incomplete development of the breasts and buttocks that came from the lack of hormones can be promoted, so as to change their pessimistic psychology, strengthen nerves, and correct concepts, so the hysteria they suffer from can be removed, and because of the smooth menstruation and the recovery of fertility, such as the vigorous metabolic function, full and delicate muscles, and the fading of aging wrinkles, they become a beautiful and moving woman. However, those who have white discharge can use "Kaerxuedi vaginal tablets" externally to remove the discharge.</p>
<h3>Corrosion of Gonorrheal Urethra</h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>The patient is You Xiaoyun. In the old days, he was bewildered by prostitutes and suddenly contracted gonorrhea. Later, he mistakenly performed a rough urethral washing method, which caused the urethral mucosa to rupture and was invaded by gonococci, resulting in several small holes corroded in the urethra (as shown in the first figure). This was discovered after I used a urethroscope to check the above-mentioned condition. If this symptom is not treated quickly, the urethra will be perforated and the reproductive function will be lost. After surgery and electrotherapy, he was also instructed to take the German "Kelinong" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, prevent corrosion, and promote diuresis, and to use "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva" to wash and inject the urethra, so that gonococci have no foothold. In four weeks, the symptoms were gone, urination was easy, and the pain was relieved. After using a urethroscope again, the urethra was smooth and restored to its original state. (As shown in the second figure).</p>
<h3>First Picture</h3>
<p>This is the corrosion of the urethra into holes before taking "Kelinong", which is about to perforate.</p>
<h3>Second Picture</h3>
<p>After taking "Kelinong" and washing externally with "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva", the lesions have been removed and restored to their original state.</p>
<h3>A Few Words on Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>... Female leukorrhea is the main cause of infertility and damage to health and beauty</p>
<p>Most women do not pay attention to leukorrhea, thinking that these diseases are just a minor problem. How can they know that they secretly damage the health of the reproductive system, resulting in infertility, and if not, they also have a great impact on health and beauty. Women who suffer from leukorrhea have dark gray circles around their eyes. This is a great hindrance to health and beauty. Most patients have vaginal erosion, and foul dirt flows down. The reproductive system is stimulated and various diseases occur, such as irregular menstruation, abdominal distension, and stabbing pain. They feel great pain during intercourse and urination.</p>
<p>According to the practice of gynecologists in Europe and the United States, the appropriate treatment for this symptom is to use "Kaerxuedi vaginal tablets" externally as a suppository, which is most effective in preventing corrosion, stopping secretion, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and killing bacteria. Therefore, it can sweep away leukorrhea in three or four weeks. However, the cause should also be identified and treated separately. If it is caused by gonorrhea, the German "Kelinong" can be taken internally, and if it is caused by menstrual disease, "Bunurong" can be taken together, so as to achieve a fundamental treatment effect. This method can also be used for self-treatment at home.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture by Physician Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation hours): 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>How to Avoid Turning into Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Suffering from gonorrhea is not a very terrible symptom. As long as it is handled properly after infection, it will definitely not cause the risk of other secondary complications. Because secondary complications are mostly seen in chronic gonorrhea. Treatment is more difficult. Therefore, those who suffer from gonorrhea for the first time should pay twelve points of attention to its treatment methods. How can they get rid of the pain of gonorrhea as soon as possible, and how can they avoid the aggravation of symptoms? Roughly speaking, after contact with unclean heterosexuals, in three to five days, there will be gonorrhea symptoms, such as itching and pain in the urethra. Later, the pain is more severe, urination is frequent, the foreskin is turned over, and the urethra secretes pus and blood. After several weeks, the pain symptoms gradually decrease. Gonococci also invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, and symptoms such as prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, vas deferens inflammation, and orchitis are a great threat to fertility.</p>
<p>However, if there is a way to save it when it is about to enter the chronic stage, it can still be avoided. Zheng Muzhai, who lives in Jiaxing Road, was seduced by a classmate last month and went from a certain dance hall to a brothel, resulting in gonorrhea. Although he was treated by a doctor for two or three weeks, the pain did not decrease, and the pus and blood flowed. So he asked me for treatment. After I checked, I found that a part of Zheng's gonococci had entered the posterior urethra, and there was a trend of prostatitis. However, the root of the disease was not long, so it was easy to remove. So I instructed him to take the German "Kelinong" to choke bacteria and reduce inflammation, and to use "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva" externally to sweep away the urethra and remove the local gonococci. However, Zheng mistakenly bought other inferior drugs, which caused the disease to change. So I still instructed him to buy and take "Kelinong". When buying, he recognized the three words "Kelinong", and after taking it, he was completely cured in three or four weeks. When taking "Kelinong", I used alternating long and short waves for treatment. In three weeks, Zheng left Shanghai due to some incident. So I instructed him to use "Anti-Gonococi-Aqva" externally and wash and treat himself at home according to the instructions. Two weeks later, I received a letter from him saying that the gonorrhea had been cured. And it was proven by the local doctor's examination.</p>

<h3>Rescuing Diminished Performance</h3>
<p>— Authored by Moore (British), Translated by Doctor Yang Dao (Returned from Russia)</p>
<p>Treating Underdevelopment and Weakness from Seminal Emission and Premature Ejaculation Resulting from Masturbation:</p>
<p>A Weakened Prostate Gland Will Impact Personal Career and Family Happiness</p>
<p>Gibbon said: "Woman is a fickle animal." This saying illustrates the difficulty of mastering women. How should a man of the new era capture their love and solidify their affections? This is indeed a vital task.</p>
<p>The ultimate line of love, frankly speaking, is entirely built upon sexual life. A fulfilling sexual life not only enhances mental pleasure but also indirectly has a positive impact on one's career. A man who has lost his healthy sexual function simply lacks the strength to satisfy his wife. We will not cite extensively or raise the banner of hypocrisy. Just thinking about many famous stories in history reveals that healthy sexual function is indeed a crucial matter that every man must take seriously. However, I am not advocating aphrodisiacs here, but rather rescuing the suffering of those with diminished sexual performance.</p>
<p>The symptoms of this condition, in congenital cases, stem from a weak constitution, leading to short stature and underdeveloped sexual organs. Acquired cases are often due to ignorance in youth, mistakenly engaging in masturbation or excessive sexual activity, which injures the sexual organs, destroys the prostate gland, and wastes hormones and semen. This results in symptoms such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction. Currently, the most popular method in various countries is to primarily use prostate gland hormone supplements, such as "補體康" (Bǔtǐ Kāng - "Body Comfort"), which can achieve a satisfactory effect of development and strength after taking it. If nocturnal emissions are frequent, it is advisable to also take "耐而斯遺精片" (Nài Ér Sī Yíjīng Piàn - "Nels Anti-Seminal Emission Pills") to fortify the seminal gate.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medications are all designated by physicians who have graduated from medical universities both domestically and abroad. Please clearly identify the names of each medication when purchasing! Do not purchase miscellaneous inferior medications based on the advice of others, to avoid the danger of incorrect use.</p>
<p>External Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Shurui from this city asks: I have contracted gonorrhea, and it has been several months. The discharge of pus is intermittent, and there are many stringy substances in my urine. When urinating, my urethra feels hot and painful. In the mornings, my urethral opening is often blocked with pus. Currently, my friend Mr. Yang Renxiang was cured of chronic gonorrhea by taking the albuminous pigment preparation "克淋儂" (Kè Lín Nóng - "Clinon"). In addition to taking it, is there a medicine for external washing of the urethra? And where can I purchase it?</p>
<p>Answer: Recently, Germany invented an external solution for gonorrhea called "抗淋水" (Kàng Lín Shuǐ - "Anti-Gonorrhea Water"), specifically for washing the urethra or vagina of both male and female patients. It is available at the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and Tai He Pharmacy. The box includes detailed illustrations and usage instructions. It is an essential medicine for private self-treatment of gonorrhea, with reliable effectiveness and no drawbacks.</p>
<p>Chest Tightness and Constipation</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Yiping from Qingdao asks: Due to overeating, I have developed a stomach ailment that has not yet been cured. I lack appetite, and even the most delicious delicacies are repulsive to me. I experience belching, acid reflux, chest tightness, abdominal bloating, and hidden pain in my intestines. My stools are hard and streaked with blood. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>Answer: This is chronic gastritis. "强胃精" (Qiáng Wèi Jīng - "Strong Stomach Essence") will effectively correct gastrointestinal function on its own.</p>
<p>Asthma and Consumptive Coughing</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Zhengmin from Hankou writes: I have had lung disease for years, with bloody sputum and frequent coughing, tidal fever, and night sweats. This autumn, I had shortness of breath and asthma. Fortunately, I took "補肺拿爾" (Bǔ Fèi Ná Ěr - "Pulmonal Nourisher") in combination with "補體康" (Bǔtǐ Kāng - "Body Comfort") and was cured.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The So-Called "Mistakes of Sino-Japanese Negotiations"</h3>
<p>— Kawasaki</p>
<p>On the one hand, they use airplanes and cannons to invade our country's territory, and on the other hand, they propose certain conditions to negotiate with us. The deep meaning behind this is obvious.</p>
<p>In the eyes of our neighbors, it seems that the inability to adjust relations between China and Japan is caused by the anti-Japanese movement in China. Therefore, it must be "completely eradicated," even to the point of "resorting to other resolute methods to achieve their goals."</p>
<p>As for why the anti-Japanese movement arose, they believe that "adjusting relations is an extremely difficult task," so they should not bring up the issues of preventing unfortunate incidents and adjusting relations at the same time. Moreover, they are engaging in work with a threatening posture. As a result, the longer the time passes, the more it will incite the anti-Japanese movement. However, they have forgotten that during the negotiations, they bombed Pingdiquan with airplanes and attacked Sui East and Sui North with a large army. Is this what they call "resolute methods"?</p>
<p>It has been a full five years since the September 18th Incident! In these five years, our neighbors have created many unfortunate incidents in our country, such as seizing the five northeastern provinces and eastern Hebei, bombing Shanghai, manipulating North China, and currently using the Datong Line and instigating Mongolian troops to attack Sui province! In the past five years, how many compatriots have been killed, and how much property has been lost? We have not forgotten these, and we are constantly reminded of them by the continuous development of these unfortunate incidents.</p>
<p>Of course, presenting various conditions with a threatening posture will incite the anti-Japanese movement. But will resolutely stopping negotiations on the North China anti-communist problem and other issues that are not directly related to the unfortunate anti-Japanese incidents lead to the discovery of a path to adjustment? The problem is not that simple. To find a path to adjustment, it is naturally necessary to "completely eradicate the anti-Japanese movement." But to completely eradicate the anti-Japanese movement, it is necessary to fundamentally eliminate the various causes that create the anti-Japanese movement. This means that the Japanese authorities should absolutely prohibit any behavior that is likely to cause antipathy from China and revoke all established facts, such as withdrawing troops stationed in China and returning all occupied territories. In this way, the anti-Japanese movement will naturally disappear, and the relations between the two countries will naturally be adjusted, and unfortunate incidents will never happen again. Conversely, if they demand adjustment on the one hand, and on the other hand, use airplanes and cannons to massacre our people and create new unfortunate incidents, then there is no way to adjust relations, and it will only further incite the anti-Japanese movement, which is a great mistake indeed.</p>
<p>In short, if the authorities of our neighboring country do not stop their aggression, then the hope of adjustment is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<h3>Aid to Suiyuan</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Previously, it was reported that prisoners in Jiangdu County Prison, in order to save one day's worth of expenses from across the country to dedicate to the nation, especially abstained from food for one day on the eleventh of this month and transferred the funds to the government to be used to strengthen national defense. They also requested that compatriots across the country save one day's worth of expenses to contribute to the government in exchange for the final victory of the nation and the ethnic group. The prisoners are criminals. As prisoners in prison who have already been sentenced to penal servitude, they still do not forget the nation, do not forget their compatriots, and do not forget the soldiers who are defending the border and protecting the people of Suiyuan. They are willing to abstain from food for one day to supply the soldiers who are defending the border and protecting the people of Suiyuan. How much is their prison ration per day? They are willing to abstain from food to supply the soldiers who are defending the border and protecting the people of Suiyuan. Compared to those who are not prisoners and contribute to the government, and do not need to abstain from food, I don't know what feelings this evokes.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe has negotiated with Foreign Minister Zhang seven times, lasting for more than a month, and there are still no results. According to yesterday's telegram, the Sino-Japanese negotiations are about to end. It is really like the saying, "Talking for three days and three nights, where will it lead?" Where it leads is fine, and can be said to be acceptable. However, while negotiating, military actions are being taken, with many schemes and unfathomable mysteries. How can this kind of behavior be allowed to be free without being subjected to severe and effective restraint? If this is not done, then the negotiations are simply meddling, and the communication is just a formality, which is definitely not what our people expect from the diplomatic authorities. According to a telegram from Jining on the fourteenth, on the night of the thirteenth, bandit cavalry fiercely attacked the defensive positions in eastern Suiyuan. It was not until four o'clock yesterday morning that they began to retreat. Nine planes from a certain side reconnoitered Pingdiquan. According to a telegram from Guihua on the fifteenth, military officers from a certain side participated in the bandit forces. A skirmish occurred in eastern Suiyuan, and the bandits are busily transporting supplies and actively preparing for military action. This kind of behavior cannot be regarded as just ordinary bandits.</p>
<p>However, there are two aspects of the aid-to-Suiyuan movement that deserve the most attention: one is material assistance, and the other is practical assistance. Our people are capable of material assistance, but our people are not capable of practical assistance. According to previous news, the defensive work in Suiyuan is extremely solid, and the equipment is also very sufficient. However, the problem of flour is still a shortage, and military uniforms are also needed. How can we bear to see these soldiers who are defending the country and protecting the people go hungry on the front lines and freeze to death in the ditches without quickly taking action, opening our purses, and providing assistance? Therefore, various places in Tianjin and Beijing took the lead in launching the aid-to-Suiyuan movement, and various places in Nanjing and Shanghai followed suit. I think everyone has a patriotic heart, and this kind of aid-to-Suiyuan movement will soon spread throughout the country, which is undoubtedly a matter of little concern.</p>
<p>However, according to the statement from friendly countries, the current bandit army's attack is unrelated to them and is entirely a matter of internal affairs. Is this statement credible? According to a telegram from Jining, there were nine planes from a certain side reconnoitering Pingdiquan; according to a telegram from Guihua, military officers from a certain side participated in the bandit forces in combat. Therefore, it is clear that the bandit disaster in Suiyuan is not just an invasion by bandits. Furthermore, looking at their plan, since the entire negotiation failed, they are using the method of invading bit by bit. In this way, they can use less force and achieve more success. If we only rely on the Suiyuan army and do not provide assistance from other armies, it is extremely dangerous. Therefore, the current aid to Suiyuan not only requires material assistance, but also practical assistance from various places, which is especially important and urgent. All of our people should rise up to do the Save-Suiyuan movement, and all of our soldiers should rise up to do the Rescue-Suiyuan movement.</p>
<h3>On Reading Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Ziying</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, countless new events occur around the world every day. Due to the development of modern journalism and the global spread of news networks, news agencies around the world select the most important events that have a direct or indirect impact on all of humanity and provide them to newspapers for publication. Furthermore, due to the close organization of all political and economic institutions in the international community, their importance is further increased. For example, after Roosevelt's re-election as President of the United States, political commentators from various countries rushed to evaluate its impact on their own countries. France's abandonment of the gold standard caused scholars from various countries to study its impact on their own economies. Therefore, if you are a member of human society in the 20th century and want to understand the era in which you live, the country to which you belong, and the importance of your position in your own country, you must read the newspaper every day. Otherwise, your existence is blind, and you will become a laggard in the times. Therefore, reading the newspaper is a job that everyone who can read the newspaper should do every day. It can be said to be a part of daily life that is as important as eating every day. In particular, the Chinese people today, when the country is at a critical juncture of life and death, every citizen should pay close attention to the evolution of serious situations, such as the Sino-Japanese negotiations currently taking place in Nanjing and the conflicts between the Suiyuan garrison and the Meng puppet troops. Only after thoroughly understanding these events can they express legitimate public opinion. This kind of public opinion is a great force to urge the government, and the government cannot and dare not ignore it.</p>
<p>However, the actual situation in China is really too pitiful. With a population of 470 million, the circulation of the largest daily newspaper is only over 100,000 copies per day. Compared with the circulation of millions of copies of well-known newspapers in the United States, we are really pitifully small. Even compared to Japan, the circulation of some important newspapers is over one million copies. On the one hand, this is due to the lack of widespread education in our country and the large number of illiterate people. On the other hand, many people who have received education, even university students who have received higher education, do not have the habit of reading newspapers, which is really distressing. The situation is even worse for women. Few women read newspapers while they are in school, and once they leave school and get married, they are simply cut off from newspapers. This is a common fact before our eyes that no one can deny. But we should know that our female compatriots make up half of our country's population! Although the number of female compatriots who know how to read newspapers is already very small, the fact that this small number of people who can read newspapers do not read newspapers is indeed a serious problem that deserves our attention. As for the universalization of education, that is another issue, which will be discussed later. People in every family are often very heavily influenced by the mistress of the house. If the mistress of the house can enthusiastically read the newspaper and pay attention to domestic and international political and economic trends, then everyone else will also be influenced by her. In short, we should launch a newspaper-reading movement so that everyone who can read the newspaper reads the newspaper every day. Those who do not have the ability to read the newspaper should also find ways to make them aware of the facts published in the newspaper. I believe that this is just like the "universal mobilization of the intelligence of all the people," which is called by the Japanese military in their recently published booklet as the most important thing for Japan today. It will definitely have a great effect on spiritual national defense.</p>
<h3>Street Cries on a Cold Night</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren, in his essay "Street Cries at the End of the Year," mentioned the deep, sorrowful calls of those selling "hard-crust steamed buns" in Beijing on winter nights, which caused those of us who have never been to Beijing to abandon our books and let our imaginations run wild. This, like the passage by Nagai Kafu on ukiyo-e prints, "the paper lantern of the soba noodle vendor shines lonely on the riverside at night," pleases me because at night I often forget the existence of the world and myself. But "street cries late at night," whether the sounds of small businesses or relying on one's ears or eyes, make me feel that I am still a part of this organic world.</p>
<p>Street cries late at night are probably mostly from those selling food for late-night snacks. Those who have finished their work during the day chat idly with friends late into the night and suddenly realize that it is very late. At that moment, they feel a little hungry, and just then someone selling late-night snacks passes by. His calls startle those who are talking, and they go out to buy something to eat, which is really very interesting.</p>
<p>We do not know when the selling of hard-crust steamed buns began in Beijing. In the south, there are now many things to eat for late-night snacks, but it seems that only malt sugar has been recorded.</p>
<p>Gu Lu's "Qing Jia Lu" mentions malt sugar in the ninth month:</p>
<p>"Scholars boil rice with malt sprouts to make sugar, which is called malt sugar. It is sold on cold nights, and the sound of gongs echoes through the streets, extremely desolate. Cai Yun's Wu Ballads says: 'Dark mist has enveloped us for three days, preparing for the west wind to blow proudly tonight; the cold air arrives as tin is sold in the deep alleys, the sound of the chime is nothing like a flute.'"</p>
<p>Cai Yun's poem cannot completely shake off its scholarly air. But Gu Lu's "the sound of gongs echoes, extremely desolate through the streets," allows us to get a sense of the bleakness of the west wind and the sound of gongs rising in the cold night.</p>
<p>"餳 (Táng)," is called "飴 (Yí)" in the annotations to the Chu Ci. That is the ancient "銀鍠 (Yín Huáng)." The people of Wu call it sugar. The reason it is only sold between autumn and winter is because at that time, "the wind is dry and the sugar is brittle, which is good for people's teeth." The Suzhou Prefecture Chronicle says, "The malt sugar that comes from Zhitang Market in Changshu is called scallion tube sugar; the malt sugar that comes from Kunshan and is shaped like a triangular prism is called hemp zong sugar." And the Wu Ballads annotation even says: Selling "餳 (Táng)" on winter nights is for those who work at night "to relieve their hunger." Qian Xingxi's poem from Jiashan says, "The shoulder pole carrying 餳 (Táng) is sold at night, we hear the gong." The reason for buying 餳 (Táng) on cold nights in Wu is not for the idle to have a late-night snack, but for the "night workers" to relieve their hunger. This makes us feel a sense of the "human touch of labor."</p>
<p>Now, those who buy 餳 (Táng) are no longer limited to the cold nights of Wu. In the alleys of Shanghai, you can see people buying 餳 (Táng) who are knocking on "hand gongs" at any time. However, most of them no longer buy with money, but exchange it for waste goods such as rags and scrap iron.</p>
<p>Since the sound of "hard-crust steamed buns" in Beijing is so bleak and sorrowful that it pierces people's hearts, and the sound of buying 餳 (Táng) in Wu on cold nights is also "extremely desolate in the streets," this is nothing more than the result of the hardships of life and the loneliness of the floating world.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are "street cries at night" very often. But the night in the city is already no different from the day, so we cannot easily find street cries that are different from the day. The sound of Guangdong people selling olives will make even the most patient people angry. The sound of selling ginkgo nuts in early autumn is only slow and melodious, and is no longer a "soul's cry." As for the singing of those selling foreign goods, it makes those who hear it immediately unhappy, and they have already reached the point of using bad singing to force people to buy.</p>
<p>As I approach middle age, the heroic spirit of youth is completely gone, and I pay special attention to these small things. "How great is my decline!"</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and what follows is the long winter night. When will I be able to go to Wu and hear the sound of the gong selling 餳 (Táng)? When will I be able to go to Beijing and hear the cries of "hard-crust steamed buns"? I have really had enough of the sound of buying foreign goods!</p>
<h3>The People Underground</h3>
<p>— Sansan</p>
<p>—Coal Miners in Guizhou—</p>
<p>One mountain connects to another, without interruption, without end, putting the entire province of Guizhou in the embrace of mountains. In these countless mountains, inexhaustible resources are buried.</p>
<p>Coal is one of the most important.</p>
<p>Its deposits are mostly found at the base of sturdy mountains with sparse vegetation. Those who operate coal mines dig a hole at the foot of the mountain, sloping downwards, directly reaching the coal deposit. Sometimes this can extend for several miles.</p>
<p>You can only crawl into the cave bent over, but after only a few steps, you must crawl like a dog. These sloping underground tunnels are generally only half a person high and two people wide. Inside, you cannot see clearly, not even your own body. You must use your hands as "antennae" to listen to whether you should turn, otherwise, your head will rudely bump into the rocks. There is often some water accumulated inside, making it very slippery. Small pits have only one underground path, while large pits open up many branches depending on the amount of coal reserves and capital.</p>
<p>There are several types of workers in the coal mine. One type is those who dig coal at the bottom of the pit. This area is relatively higher and wider than the tunnels, but the coal miners must often lie on their backs to drill into the coal seams.</p>
<p>In the coal mine, as most people imagine, it is filled with pungent coal gas. In reality, however, there is no coal gas at all, because this is "raw coal." Therefore, what makes the workers suffer is a lamp. This lamp uses tung oil, and the wick is almost as thick as a little finger, constantly releasing tung oil smoke. Since the air in the cave is not circulating, new workers feel even more distressed by this smell. As soon as they crawl in, their lungs feel like they are being propped up by something, making it difficult to breathe. And within minutes, their heads feel like they are being stuffed with something tight. But they have to work eight hours in the pit. Moreover, those who work at the bottom of the pit often face the possibility of accidents. If the coal block above their heads loosens and collapses, they will be buried. If they are lucky, they will only lose a hand or a foot. The bosses say this is "bad luck," and at most, they will give a piece of "fired wood board" as compensation.</p>
<p>Every day, they spend eight hours without seeing the sun, breathing tung oil smoke, and trying their best to dig into the hard coal mine, but they only earn a little over one string of cash (approximately equivalent to over three dimes).</p>
<p>Another type of worker is the coal pullers. Their job is to pull the dug coal out of the cave.</p>
<p>The tool for pulling coal is a bamboo basket, which they call a "boat." This boat can hold one or two hundred pounds of coal. Each time, they have to drag this one or two hundred pounds of coal out like a dog pulling a cart, and the road is pitch black and uneven. So when they crawl, they often whistle. This is to notify the people coming ahead to stop in a relatively wide place so that they can drag the coal past. Their wages are less than those of the coal diggers, only about one string of cash a day.</p>
<p>In the cave, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, they are all naked, without wearing any clothes. Even the coal pullers rarely wear pants.</p>
<p>These two types of workers are the most numerous. Usually, even a single tunnel has dozens of workers (working in three shifts). In places with many branches, the number increases to hundreds. The number of workers working on the surface is relatively small.</p>
<p>One type is the fan operators, who send air from a small hole that has been dug out to the bottom of the pit. This is necessary so that the lamps can be lit and people can live.</p>
<p>There are also the coal-burning workers. The place where coal is burned is next to the entrance of the cave, in a circular shape with a diameter of about thirty feet. Every morning, around the coal-burning area, men, women, and even eleven- or twelve-year-old children stand, waiting for the coal to be burned (cooked coal) and transported to the city dozens of miles away to be sold. They endure the coal smoke swirling around the valley, letting that peculiar odor sting their noses.</p>
<p>Nearby, one straw shed after another is built, serving as the workers' dwellings. Inside the houses, the floor is completely covered with rice straw. A room of only three square feet often sleeps more than a dozen people. In their dwellings, you can always find several opium lamps. Almost every coal mine worker is addicted to opium. Without smoking, they cannot eliminate that excessive fatigue.</p>
<p>There are tens of thousands of these workers in Guizhou, but because they are working with primitive methods, although they exert excessive effort, the amount of coal produced is still limited, so that many local residents still do not have coal to burn.</p>
<h3>The First Day in Saigon (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>However, another half hour passed, and the people were still baking in the scorching sun? Large beads of sweat streamed down their faces, and the shirts of those wearing short sleeves were completely soaked with sweat. Suddenly, a uniformed Chinese man appeared and shouted, "Hey, line up, line up!"</p>
<p>People looked at him bewildered, but still instinctively crowded together to form two lines. Many men with families led their wives and children, but those wearing Western clothes shouted:</p>
<p>"Women go to the women's line, men go to the men's line!" The voice was extraordinarily fierce.</p>
<p>"Sir, I don't know the way! What's wrong with us being together? We already have three children!"</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, we were lined up in two lines, with the women's line going first. We followed behind. Many people with guns and leather whips and rattan canes stood on both sides of us. But as soon as this makeshift line stepped off the drawbridge, it immediately fell into chaos. Many women wanted to turn back to look for their husbands, and many men wanted to go forward to find their wives. Some people wanted to run ahead, and some people wanted to go out to say a few words to their acquaintances... So the fierce whips fell like raindrops on everyone's heads, along with crude language and shouts. When the crowd saw the whips being raised, they covered their heads, avoided the blows, and squeezed together. On the road, the shouts, cries, and the dull sound of whips landing on flesh, like red-hot iron bars falling into water, merged into one.</p>
<p>My hopes were dashed. My back was whipped twice with a heavy whip. In the crowd, I unconsciously burst into tears. I thought: This is just like a group of slaves of a conquered country being whipped as they are led to the execution ground, and towards the distant, once despised "Tangshan" (China), a feeling of love naturally arose.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, we stopped in front of a Western-style building. Thinking about all the future hardships, I couldn't help but tremble.</p>

<p>Mei Luo Xiang</p>
<p>Mei Luo Xiang has been back in Shanghai for six months and hasn't had any roles. Initially, she had some savings and jewelry to pawn to get by, but as time passed, she was running out of resources and facing financial problems. She hadn't paid rent for three months.</p>
<p>Qin Si Tian, a male role singer who lived in the back room, was merely a friend and colleague. He had also recently lost his job, so he often came to Mei Luo Xiang's room to chat. Once, he mentioned the major shareholder of the Ming Xin Stage, Bai Sen Qing, and encouraged her to ask him for help.</p>
<p>Mei Luo Xiang was almost moved by his words, but seeing Ma Zi Ying's letters arriving daily, saying that the future wasn't entirely hopeless, she felt as if she'd received a shot of adrenaline and didn't want to surrender to Bai Sen Qing.</p>
<p>Bai Sen Qing also knew about her recent financial difficulties and bribed the morally corrupt actress Xiao Chun Lan to tempt Mei Luo Xiang with various methods. Mei Luo Xiang, like many women in society, sometimes seemed very rational, but other times couldn't resist the lure of material things. In the end, she surrendered to Bai Sen Qing's trap.</p>
<p>Mei Luo Xiang and Bai Sen Qing lived together for two months, and they both seemed to be growing tired of each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mei Luo Xiang received an urgent letter from Ma Zi Ying. He had struck it rich by opening a gold mine on Gulangyu Island and was coming to Shanghai today to fulfill their vows to each other. This put Mei Luo Xiang in a dilemma!</p>
<p>She knelt before Bai Sen Qing and begged him to allow her to go with Ma Zi Ying. Bai Sen Qing initially pretended to refuse, but later agreed. In reality, his enthusiasm for Mei Luo Xiang had long cooled.</p>
<p>But would Ma Zi Ying forgive her momentary lapse of weakness?…</p>

<p>Zhong Xi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Lament of a Poor Woman"</p>
<p>Snowflakes dance and fill the sky. Xu Niang's heart is in a mess. Alone by the cold window, she often sighs sadly. She remembers when she was a delicate girl in the Tian family. Her parents loved her like a treasure. There was nothing she couldn't have, save the moon in the sky. Her meals were carefully chosen, and in winter she wore brocade and in summer she wore silk. Her parents arranged her marriage, hoping for a harmonious and loving couple. But unexpectedly, her husband was a pleasure-seeking wastrel. He didn't attend to his business, only wanting to chase after flowers. Furthermore, his parents were addicted to opium. The family business declined, making it difficult to make ends meet. Now, as the cold wind blows and the day grows colder, she lacks clothing and food, causing her suffering. Her children cry pitifully before her, wearing thin clothes with little cotton. Her heart is heavy, and tears fall. She hates her husband's crooked heart. He wastes money seeking pleasure, but does he know that there is no rice or firewood at home? He chats happily with courtesans in warm rooms, while she sits here by the dim lamp, practicing embroidery. She pities herself for working tirelessly and sacrificing her delicate body. She laments that she earns so little money that it's hard to support the family. Furthermore, the children are too young to study. She pities herself for being a poor and miserable woman. Moreover, she has borrowed from relatives and neighbors, and has no choice but to return to her mother's home. She doesn't care that the weather is cold and the road is slippery.</p>

<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Anecdotes of Beauties"</p>
<p>Singing of anecdotes of beauties, the rights and wrongs are truthfully presented. Just speak of it, just listen to it, it's nothing more than playing games to pass the time. The sisters of the Flower School returned to Shun, those were, Emperor E Huang and Empress Nü Ying. You Mei Xi was born extravagant, with wine as a pool and meat as a forest. Da Ji wanted to harm loyal and good people, and cleverly set up the name of branding torture. King Zhou You lured and doted on Bao Si, and the beacon fires were set off for no reason, disrupting the administration. Xi Shi, the woman from the village of Luo Luo, forgot Wu to avenge and repay the state of Yue. Xiang Yu cut himself under Gai Xia in the Wu River, and Yu Ji died for her integrity. Leaving the fortress to make peace was unavoidable, and Zhaojun sighed leaving her homeland. In the gentle country, there is unlimited joy, and Flying Swallow dances lightly on her palm. Yin Lihua's beautiful name was passed on to Guangwu, who actually established her as Empress to assist in the revitalization. Returning to the Eastern Han with eighteen Tartar pipes, one can admire Wenji's harmonious sounds. The Two Qiaos were not locked up by A Man, leaving only the Bronze Sparrow Terrace to talk about the depths of spring. Xue Lingyun's needlework was praised as wonderful, and the Wei Palace gained her fame at night. Green Pearl fell to the building and had her own ambition, vowing to protect her chastity and not marry. Zhang Lihua was favored by the Chen Lord, and her glowing hair was deeply thankful. The wise eyes of Hong Fu recognized Junjie, but accepted love and eloped privately. Empress Wu Zetian's heart was ruthless, and she poisoned her mother and killed her king to take the court. On the seventh day of July in the Palace of Eternal Life, Tai Zhen expressed her feelings in the middle of the night. Willow waist, cherry lips, Xiao Man Fan Su are matched with poets. The heroic woman Liang Hongyu personally held the drumstick and fought the Jin soldiers. Dong Xiaowan, in the Pavilion of Yan Yue, was talented and excelled in painting. Since ancient times, it has been difficult to count all the beauties, and historical records have clearly recorded them. I will pause here for a while.</p>

<p>New Opening on Wealth, Nobility, Poverty and Meanness</p>
<p>All are born after ten months of pregnancy. Heaven is extremely fair. Who knows that the social situation has changed, dividing wealth, nobility, poverty, and meanness into heavy and light. The rich have unlimited wealth that is difficult to calculate. Gold, silver, and jewels fill the chests. There are countless high halls and large houses, calling maids and prostitutes to cook meals. They buy good fields and take the rent, ignoring the bankruptcy of the peasants who want to use knives and swords. The noble ones have power and influence and deceive people to the extreme. There is no justice and they don't care about fame. They don't think that... difficult to last.</p>

<p>Sacrifice, the most... The circumstances of ordinary people are very poor. Struggling without a door to speak. Striving to maintain the heart is exhausted. It is a pity that there is land that cannot be cultivated. Some people have failures that suddenly arise from short-sightedness, hanging themselves and throwing themselves into the water, 横. I think that Confucius of Ni Mountain is hard to match. He said that evenness means there is no poverty. It is a pity that no one relies on this to handle it, so that it becomes a class divided into honor and disgrace. In the future, after equality and freedom, all will be treated the same as brothers. Only then will we be able to see the sea clear.</p>
