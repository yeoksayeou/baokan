<h3 id="c1">再論暴利主義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨天社評論消滅暴利主義，同時，主張對於正當工商業應盡力保護，使上海經濟界步入正軌，逐漸配合戰時需要。也許有人對於暴利主義的內容發生疑問，於此，我們不憚煩瑣再作進一步的詮釋。</p>
<p>什麽是暴利主義？我們在五月十二日論「名譽第一」的社評中說過：「追求暴利者，其居心必然是不擇手段，不顧大衆，損人利己，惟圖私利。」道些就是暴利主義者槪括的內容。更就逍個範圍加以引申如次：</p>
<p>不擇手段者。凡是認為有暴利可圖之審，只須達到暴利之目的，採用任何不正當之手段，在所不計。譬如某喉科醫生，認為治白喉所用之特效藥血淸針，市上存貨不多，如加以收買國積，必可待善價而沽，於是傾注資力收羅，結果市上存貨供不應求，市價暴漲，轉手之間，獲致暴利。這就是團積投機之一例，就是採用不正當手段，追求暴利。</p>
<p>不顧大衆者，凡是認為有暴利可圖之事，只須達到暴利之目的，任何有害大衆之下策，在所不顧。同上舉例，在息白喉之病家，因藥價暴漲，無力購用，忍受痛苦，甚且因而致命。其次，因血淸計團積時間過久，藥性消失，縱出高價，也屬無用。這種使病衆痛苦，使病衆致命者，就是囤藥者追求暴利所致。暴利主義者固然完成了一己的暴利目的，而大衆的痛苦與生命就不顧了。　工商業以營利為目的，固然無可非議。可是，所謂營利，是指合理的利潤，而暴利則絕不是合理的利潤。凡是營利而超過合理範圍，就是暴利。至於合理利潤的範圍，雖然不能規定嚴格的標準，但是與暴利的界限，很為明顯。合理利潤，用正當方法經營，顧到大衆利益。反之，就是不合理利潤，就是暴利。</p>
<p>追求暴利，除用不正當手段，不顧大衆利益之外，更利用特殊勢力，利用戰時機會，混水撈魚。利用特殊勢力，是與貪官勾結，狼狽為奸。利用戰時機會，是假藉戰時制度與戰時法令，巧取豪奪。奸商為貪官的爪牙，貪官為奸商的背景，奸商養成貪官的野心，貪官助長奸商的氣燄，朋比為奸，暴利主義更滲入了政治力量，於是益發抬頭。</p>
<p>上面論列，已將暴利主義的面目與實質加以暴露，而暴利主義抬頭以後，促成社會的畸形，昨論已詳言之。在此戰時足以擾亂經濟，危害民生之暴利主義，自應以最嚴厲手段激底消滅。一方面，對於正當工商業，尤其是生產事業，民生工業，在謀取合理利潤下，當然與暴利絕對不同。不但不能與暴利混為一談，尤須在資本上，原料上，動力上，運銷上予以保障，予以獎勵。</p>
<h3 id="c2">奪回密芝那企圖遭日軍精銳粉碎　英空軍挺身部隊限於包圍 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>仰光三十日中央社電　富貢地方之渝美軍及霍平方面之敵空軍挺身隊，並怒江西岸之渝雲南軍，雖多次企圖奪回北，打開援渝路綫，經日軍精銳果敢之攻擊，巳蒙重創。有敵空軍挺身隊一部降落於密芝那附近，經日軍猛攻後，其奪回密芝那之企圖已被粉碎，甚至不得不敗退。該方面綜合戰果，迄本月二十三日判明者已有敵棄屍一千二百具（美兵包括在內），戰利品計輕迫擊砲三·機關砲二·實輕機槍二十一·步槍及狙擊槍九十六·此外被服糧　揮藥等無算。同時因雨季之來臨，河水氾濫，敵軍不僅橋標流失，即其空軍亦將停止，而缺乏食糧彈藥之補給，致其退路亦被切斷，陷於孤立狀態。企圖奪回密芝那，進而奪回北緬之迷夢，竟在如此悲哀中告終矣。</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　據倫敦來電：於富貢西南密芝那曼特勒鐵道附近降落之英空挺隊，經日軍猛烈攻擊後，向北方密林地帶退却。又據路透社特派員報稱：該方面英人部隊現被日軍有力部隊句隊，二十七日日步兵突入展開肉據戰，致飛機塲被佔領，補給亦被遮斷。</p>
<p>納爾海馬方面敵反攻被擊潰</p>
<p>仰光三十日中央社電　哥希馬周圍之英印軍，自日印同盟軍發動攻勢蒙受重創後，即重整軍容企圖蠢動。茲悉哥希馬周圍已降大雨，但自廿三日以來，雙方仍於泥濘中展開白刃戰。納函海馬方面於廿三日黃昏有古爾加兵約二百人，於飛機大砲之掩護下進攻日軍陣，結果被日軍予以挾攻而敗退。又哥希為北方五一二〇高地方面敵之攻勢亦告激烈，廿六日黎明有敵軍四百名於坦克軍掩護下來攻，經激戰四小時卒被日軍擊退。又是日傍晚有攜中型坦克車之敵步兵部隊，向該高地西南方進擊以期威脅日軍側背，然經日砲兵陣地猛烈轟擊後，敵軍遂向西北方敗走。</p>
<h3 id="c3">洞庭湖兩側　日軍進攻中　大本營昨日下午發表 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電日大本營三十日下午四時發表：華中方面日軍部隊，五月二十七日自洞庭湖兩側對渝方第六戰區及第九戰區開始進攻，擊破該地渝軍，刻在陸續進攻中。</p>
<p>日軍某部隊長談豫復與狀况</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　參加此次河南作戰活躍於第一綫之日軍某部隊長，最近返滬，談河南省之復興狀况，及現地住民熱烈協力之情形，以及民衆厭惡渝方虐政之情緒如次：　此次精强機械化部隊之建樹甚大，此乃敵我雙方一致僉認者，步兵部隊之活躍，亦曾發揮絕大之威力，其中之某步兵部隊，四十日間踏破一千公里之長途，此實創機動力之新紀錄，由此可知日軍士氣之旺滅之後，亦即渝軍敗退之從，曾發現各種新奇事象，即民衆之武裝蜂起，此之掠奪，一在與日軍協力，共同驅逐渝軍也。由此又可知當地民衆如何怨恨渝軍湯恩伯軍之苛歛誅求。　當地民衆渴望和平之心甚切，故戰火將熄之今日，後方之治安得能安穩現在即以單車通行，亦無受阻之情勢。渝方之動靜情報，皆可由住民迅速獲到。　破壞之鐵路，荒廢街巷，由於住民之熱誠協力，逐次恢復，此不僅可以表現民衆痛恨渝軍書民之殘忍。復可象徵當地黎民感謝日軍修堤救濟之熱意，民衆協力日軍，猛力從事於建設，實乃為大東亞民族自覺之眞義，因彼等自悟此種事理之眞諦，故今之復興工作，始能如此迅速也。</p>

<h3 id="c5">西南太平洋　敵美空軍現勢 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>自本年一月二日在實比登岬陸以來，對日輝威克島，馬當地區連日反覆加以轟炸的敵人，以及用在澳洲西北部，增强的航空兵力向日軍第一綫基地鐵本耳島及阿拉夫拉海，班達海繼續空襲的敵人，四月十一日在新愛爾蘭島組成大機動部隊前來出整，同月二十二日，在軍艦洋艦，驅遂艦護衛着運輸船及登睦用舟艇，大規模地。對此，日軍航空部隊連日正加以激烈攻擊，該地戰綫的情况，極為緊張慘烈。且敵人登陸賀蘭地亞，愛泰倍的企圖，欲截斷拉巴爾，馬當，威克島的日軍補充綫，並推進對菲島的航空基地。故該方面戰局的推移，極堪重視</p>
<p>本年增產目標</p>
<p>美國空軍部長維爾遜發表聲明稱：本年度飛機生產目標十二萬架，重轟炸機增產五〇％。從最近在北澳增强飛機的事實看來，該聲明似非誇大宣傳。試看美航空兵力的現勢英本土有一師團，中東有一個航空師團，最五更從北非向中東增强二航空師團。在印度，美軍的一個師團，漸被英空軍所取代；特中國大陸有希諾趨熾烈，隨時隨地繼續自主的戰門。這極驕慢的敵空軍活動，究有何意義呢！簡單地說，是敵我航空勢力之差。當地航空部隊〇〇參謀切齒扼腕的向記者聲稱「不用太多，在第一綫祇要有比現在多一倍的兵力，就可以獲得使全世界驚嘆的划時期的戰果。」</p>
<p>特摩下的第十四航空師團，阿留申方面有一師團虎視耽耽，待機蠢動，企圖進攻日本本土。在西南太平洋戰綫，新幾尼亞，所羅門方面約有一師團勢力的海軍機，及戰鬥機轟作機聯合的第三十二戰隊所組成的二空軍師，以一部置於澳洲北部，積極强增重轟炸機。南太平洋戰綫上最近敵空軍的活躍，日趨熾烈，隨時隨地繼續着自主的戰鬥。</p>
<p>這極驕慢的敵空軍活動，究有何意義呢！簡單地說，是敵我航空勢力之差。當地航空部隊〇〇參謀切齒扼腕的向記者聲稱：</p>
<p>「不用太多，在第一綫祇要有比現在多一倍的兵力，就可以獲得使全世界驚嘆的划時期的戰果。」</p>
<p>敵人常用三倍，四倍，甚至於十倍的量的優勢，採取攻勢。航空部隊的將士們為邀擊這敵人，不分畫夜的活躍不懈。為酬報這前綫將士的苦門，後方亟應着手增產，使前綫將士的活躍產生眞正的成果。</p>
<p>戰法的改變</p>
<p>最近被俘於〇〇基地的B24型前方射手，是十八歲的少年。敵人也痛切地感到航空要員的不足。轟炸機逐漸變成大型高空。看到某種機種有不適當的塲合，立即加以改變。</p>
<p>最近出沒於西南太平洋戰錢的美機種類，開戰力，本年三月以後又加上A20型。戰鬥機有P38P47P40P43型。海軍機中轟炸機有TBF，SBO,TBO三種，戰鬥機有F4F，F5F等。其攻擊方法，在波狀攻擊中，普通一攻擊單位為四，五架，約五百架；轟炸所　時間，僅五分鐘，所以或用普通高度，或用超低空，或為混合戰法。攻擊目標取戰略的攻法，以襲擊飛行基地及軍事設施為主。戰鬥機轟炸的比例，約為六對四。為極度避免人的消耗，僅用飛機作猛烈轟炸，以決定勝敗。而一旦登陸以後，則利用機械力在濕地敷設鋼席，在短期間設定了航空基地。此種戰法，現正為敵軍所重視而採用。（翔：譯自五月十九日東京讀　報知）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Re-Examining Profiteering <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the editorial commented on eliminating profiteering and, at the same time, advocated for protecting legitimate industry and commerce to guide Shanghai's economy onto the right track and gradually align it with wartime needs. Perhaps some people have questions about the content of profiteering. Here, we will elaborate further without being afraid of being tedious.</p>
<p>What is profiteering? In the editorial "Reputation First" on May 12th, we said, "Those who pursue exorbitant profits inevitably resort to unscrupulous means, disregard the public, harm others for their own benefit, and only seek personal gain." This summarizes the content of profiteering. To extend this scope further, it includes the following:</p>
<p>Resorting to unscrupulous means. Anyone who believes there is a chance to make exorbitant profits will use any improper means to achieve the goal of making exorbitant profits, regardless of the consequences. For example, a certain throat doctor believes that there is not much of the special medicine for diphtheria, serum injections, on the market. If he buys them up and hoards them, he will be able to sell them at a high price. Therefore, he pours his capital into collecting them. As a result, the supply on the market cannot meet the demand, and the market price soars. He makes exorbitant profits in a short period. This is an example of hoarding and speculation, which is the use of improper means to pursue exorbitant profits.</p>
<p>Disregarding the public. Anyone who believes there is a chance to make exorbitant profits will disregard any measures that are harmful to the public as long as the goal of making exorbitant profits is achieved. In the example above, patients with diphtheria are unable to purchase the medicine due to the soaring price, and they suffer and even die. Secondly, due to the hoarding of serum injections for too long, the potency of the medicine disappears, and it is useless even if a high price is paid. Those who make the sick suffer and die are caused by the pursuit of exorbitant profits by those who hoard medicine. Profiteers have indeed achieved their goal of making exorbitant profits, but they disregard the suffering and lives of the public. It is understandable that industry and commerce aim to make profits. However, so-called profit refers to reasonable profit, and exorbitant profit is definitely not reasonable profit. Any profit that exceeds a reasonable range is an exorbitant profit. Although a strict standard cannot be set for the scope of reasonable profit, the boundary with exorbitant profit is very clear. Reasonable profit involves operating in a legitimate manner and considering the interests of the public. Conversely, it is unreasonable profit, which is exorbitant profit.</p>
<p>In addition to using improper means and disregarding the interests of the public, the pursuit of exorbitant profits also involves taking advantage of special powers and wartime opportunities to fish in troubled waters. Taking advantage of special powers means colluding with corrupt officials and acting as accomplices. Taking advantage of wartime opportunities means using wartime systems and wartime laws to seize wealth by trickery and force. Unscrupulous merchants are the pawns of corrupt officials, corrupt officials are the background of unscrupulous merchants, unscrupulous merchants cultivate the ambition of corrupt officials, and corrupt officials fuel the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants. Colluding with each other, profiteering has further penetrated political power, and thus has become even more prominent.</p>
<p>The above discussion has exposed the face and essence of profiteering. The abnormal social development caused by the rise of profiteering has been discussed in detail in yesterday's editorial. In this wartime period, profiteering, which is enough to disrupt the economy and endanger people's livelihood, should be eliminated thoroughly with the most severe measures. On the one hand, legitimate industry and commerce, especially production enterprises and people's livelihood industries, which seek reasonable profits, are of course absolutely different from profiteering. Not only should they not be confused with profiteering, but they should also be guaranteed and encouraged in terms of capital, raw materials, power, and marketing.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Attempt to Retake Myitkyina Thwarted by Elite Japanese Troops; Allied Airborne Units Surrounded <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 30th—U.S. troops in the vicinity of Fort Hertz and Allied airborne troops in the Hopin area, as well as Yunnan Army troops on the west bank of the Salween River, have repeatedly attempted to retake Myitkyina and open up supply lines to Chongqing, but have suffered heavy losses under the courageous attacks of elite Japanese troops.  A portion of the Allied airborne troops that landed near Myitkyina has had its attempt to retake the city thwarted after fierce Japanese attacks and has even been forced to retreat.  Overall battlefield results in that sector, determined by the 23rd of this month, include 1,200 enemy bodies left behind (including American soldiers), captured materiel including three light mortars, two automatic cannons, twenty-one light machine guns, and ninety-six rifles and sniper rifles, as well as countless items of clothing, food, and ammunition.  At the same time, due to the arrival of the rainy season, river flooding has washed away enemy pontoon bridges, and Allied air support will be suspended.  The troops lack food and ammunition supplies and are cut off from retreat, leaving them isolated.  The dream of retaking Myitkyina and then all of northern Burma has thus ended in sorrow.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th—According to a report from London, British airborne troops who landed near the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway southwest of Fort Hertz have withdrawn into the northern jungle area after fierce Japanese attacks.  Reuters reports that British units in the area are now surrounded by powerful Japanese forces. On the 27th, Japanese infantry made a sudden incursion, launching hand-to-hand combat that resulted in the airfield being occupied and supplies being cut off.</p>
<p>Enemy Counterattack Repulsed in Kohima Area</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 30th—British and Indian troops around Kohima, who suffered heavy losses after the Japanese-Indian Allied forces launched an offensive, have regrouped and attempted to cause disturbances.  Heavy rain has fallen around Kohima, but both sides have been engaged in bayonet combat in the mud since the 23rd.  In the Kohima area on the evening of the 23rd, about 200 Gurkha soldiers, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attacked Japanese positions but were flanked by Japanese forces and retreated.  The enemy offensive against Height 5120 north of Kohima has also intensified. At dawn on the 26th, 400 enemy soldiers attacked under the cover of tanks but were repulsed by Japanese forces after four hours of fierce fighting.  That evening, enemy infantry units with medium tanks advanced towards the southwest of the height in an attempt to threaten the Japanese rear, but after being subjected to intense bombardment from Japanese artillery positions, the enemy troops retreated to the northwest.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops Advancing on Both Sides of Dongting Lake, Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th—Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 30th that Japanese units in Central China began an offensive on May 27th from both sides of Dongting Lake against the Sixth and Ninth War Areas of the Chongqing forces, defeating the Chongqing troops in the area and continuing to advance.</p>
<p>Japanese Unit Commander Discusses Henan Recovery and Conditions</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai—A Japanese unit commander who participated in the Henan campaign and was active on the front lines recently returned to Shanghai and discussed the recovery of Henan Province, the enthusiastic cooperation of the local residents, and the public's disgust with the Chongqing government's oppressive rule, as follows: The achievements of the strong mechanized units in this campaign were significant, which is recognized by both sides. The active performance of the infantry units also demonstrated tremendous power. One infantry unit covered 1,000 kilometers in 40 days, setting a new record for mobility. This shows the strength of the Japanese army's morale and the speed of the Chongqing army's retreat. New and strange phenomena have been discovered, namely armed uprisings by the people, who are cooperating with the Japanese army to jointly drive out the Chongqing army. This shows how much the local people resent the harsh taxes and demands of Tang Enbo's army. The local people are eager for peace. Therefore, now that the flames of war are subsiding, public order in the rear is stable. Even traveling by bicycle is unobstructed. Information about the movements of the Chongqing forces can be quickly obtained from the residents. The damaged railways and abandoned streets are being gradually restored thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the residents. This not only demonstrates the people's hatred of the Chongqing army and its cruelty, but also symbolizes the gratitude of the local people for the Japanese army's dike repair and relief efforts. The people are cooperating with the Japanese army and vigorously engaging in construction, which is the true meaning of the awakening of the peoples of Greater East Asia, because they have realized the true essence of this matter, so the recovery work can proceed so quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Political Department Uncovers Conspiracy by Chongqing Communists <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th—Since its establishment six months ago, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission has uncovered a number of cases related to Chongqing Communists, and we will continue to report on them below: Yang Shirong, head of the He-Tai County Government Telegraph Office of Chongqing, Sun Zhicheng, leader of the Second Detachment of the Reconnaissance Team of the Second Guerrilla Area of the Lu-Su War Zone, and Xu Rong, a member of the team, were arrested on the 11th and 14th of this month, respectively, and firearms and ammunition were seized. Red Communist elements Sun Jingcheng and Wang Mingxiu were hiding near Yatang, Taizhou. Staff members were sent to investigate their whereabouts and arrested them on the evening of January 6th. According to their confession, Wang had served as a public relations worker for the service group of the New Fourth Army's Advance Detachment and as a tax collector for the Gaoyou Finance Bureau. They fled to Taizhou due to marital problems. Sun had served as the head of the Funan Special Branch of the Red Communists in Gaoyou. Because the Red Communist government orders were too complicated to handle, the two came to Taizhou together. Shi Zhixin, the main culprit in the bombing of the Wuxi Jinghu Hotel and the Rixin Silk Shop, was arrested in Wuxi on January 4th. Zhu Jianru, a group leader of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, and his wife, Yu Huizhi, secretly arrived in Yankou to carry out activities. They were arrested on February 18th, and based on their confession, another Chongqing Military Affairs Commission intelligence officer, Zhan Wenzhong, was arrested. Six rolls of Dimitra plastic explosives, two fuses, and eight detonators hidden by the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army were recovered near Tan Village Temple in Changzhou. Ten Chongqing-made rifles and eight hand grenades, and two land mines were recovered in Xinan Town, Dongtai. A reactionary element, Ma Qingyun, surrendered to our political security agency in Hankou on a certain day and turned in a short gun with five bullets. Zhang Pangzi and others, graduates of the technical class of the eighth term of the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army Officer Corps, secretly went to Wuxi and Suzhou to carry out activities. Forty-three rolls of Dimitra explosives and one detonator were seized. Chen Fapeng, who had served as the director of the Agricultural Resistance Association of a certain village in the Southeast Office of the New Fourth Army, surrendered to us and presented a set of bolt-action rifles and three Hubei-made rifles. Bai Ziji, the leader of the demolition team of the Sixth Regiment of the Chongqing Loyal Salvation Army, and four members of his team surrendered to the Wuxi political security agency on a certain day and presented a large amount of explosives, including four blocks of explosives, seventy-nine blocks of Dimitra explosives, and a coil of black slow-burning fuse. After the members of the demolition group directly under the Fourth Column of the Jiangsu Security Department of Chongqing were arrested, a large amount of demolition equipment was seized, including thirteen rolls of 808 explosives, five feet of quick-burning detonating cord, two steel detonators, two immediate external electric detonators, two fuses, and one incendiary bomb.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Current State of Enemy American Air Power in the Southwest Pacific <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Since landing at Cape Gloucester on January 2nd of this year, the enemy has repeatedly bombed the Japanese garrisons on Wake Island and in the Madang area. Aircraft reinforcements from northwest Australia have continued to attack Japanese forward bases on Timor and in the Arafura and Banda Seas. On April 11th, a large enemy task force assembled off New Ireland. On April 22nd, escorted by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, transport ships and landing craft carried out a large-scale landing at Hollandia and Aitape. Japanese air units have been fiercely attacking them for days, and the situation on the front lines is extremely tense and tragic. The enemy's attempt to land at Hollandia and Aitape is aimed at cutting off the Japanese supply lines to Rabaul, Madang, and Wake Island, and advancing their air bases toward the Philippines. Therefore, the development of the war situation in that area deserves great attention.</p>
<p>This Year's Production Goals</p>
<p>U.S. Air Force Secretary Wilson issued a statement saying that the aircraft production target for this year is 120,000 aircraft, with a 50% increase in the production of heavy bombers. Judging from the recent reinforcement of aircraft in northern Australia, this statement does not seem to be an exaggeration. Let's look at the current state of U.S. air power: there is one division in the British mainland, one air division in the Middle East, and two air divisions have recently been reinforced from North Africa to the Middle East. In India, one U.S. division is gradually being replaced by the British Air Force; in China, the Sino-Japanese War is becoming more intense, and independent battles continue anytime and anywhere. In the Aleutian Islands, one division is watching and waiting for an opportunity to attack the Japanese mainland. On the Southwest Pacific front, in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, there are naval aircraft with the strength of one division and the 32nd Air Group, which is composed of fighter-bombers from two air armies, with a portion stationed in northern Australia, actively increasing the number of heavy bombers.</p>
<p>The enemy's air force activity in the South Pacific war zone has been intensifying, and independent battles are constantly continuing.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of these extremely arrogant enemy air force activities? Simply put, it is the difference in air power between the enemy and us. A staff officer of the local air force gritted his teeth and told reporters, "We don't need too much. If we had just twice the current strength on the front lines, we could achieve epoch-making results that would amaze the world."</p>
<p>The enemy often uses a three-fold, four-fold, or even ten-fold quantitative advantage to launch offensives. The officers and soldiers of the air force are working tirelessly day and night to intercept these enemies. In order to reward the hard work of the soldiers on the front lines, the rear should start increasing production as soon as possible so that the activities of the soldiers on the front lines can produce real results.</p>
<p>Changes in Tactics</p>
<p>The forward gunner of a B24 bomber recently captured at the base was an 18-year-old boy. The enemy also keenly feels the shortage of aviation personnel. Bombers are gradually becoming larger and flying at higher altitudes. If a certain type of aircraft is found to be unsuitable for a certain situation, it is immediately changed.</p>
<p>The types of American aircraft recently appearing in the Southwest Pacific war zone, including attack aircraft and, since March of this year, A20s. Fighters include P38, P47, P40, and P43 types. Among naval aircraft, bombers include TBF, SBO, and TBO types, and fighters include F4F and F5F types. In wave attacks, the usual attack unit consists of four or five aircraft, about 500 aircraft in total. The bombing time is only five minutes, so ordinary altitudes, ultra-low altitudes, or mixed tactics are used. Strategic attack methods are used to target flight bases and military facilities. The ratio of fighter to bomber strikes is about six to four. To avoid human casualties as much as possible, only aircraft are used for intense bombing to decide the outcome. Once they land, they use mechanical power to lay steel mesh on wetlands and set up air bases in a short period. This tactic is now being emphasized and adopted by the enemy forces.

<p>Shanghai - The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters held a comprehensive civilian air defense training exercise for the second day. At 6:10 AM, the first air raid alert was issued. The Baojia self-defense corps and specially established defense corps in each district immediately implemented various traffic control and aerial surveillance air raid measures.

Except for emergency vehicles, all vehicles were still prohibited from driving, and pedestrians went to shelters. After twenty minutes, they were allowed to walk along the left side of the street. Military police and police stations in each jurisdiction sent police to patrol their areas.</p>
<p>Aircraft Bombing and Communication Cut Off</p>
<p>At the same time, three aircraft soared into the sky and dropped various paper mock bombs. After the aerial blue sentry reported the location of the drop, the Baojia self-defense air defense corps members in each area immediately implemented bomb extinguishing and fire fighting work, and immediately reported to the military police and relevant authorities, who sent personnel to the scene to guide rescue and five minutes of alert.
