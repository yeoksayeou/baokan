<p>社評</p>
<h3>一個迫切呼籲　請求政府豁免國民小學學費</h3>
<p>這次本報舉辦的大東亞戰爭國民常識展覽會，會期三日，恰巧第六屆助學金開始申請，我們就假座展覽會塲發給助學金申請表，希望學生們順便參觀展覽會，得到一些戰時常識。不料三日來的擁擠情况，出乎意外，使我們大爲感動，更相信不但我們親目所見的爲之感動，就是聽到這些消息的也一定感動而靈視之。爲什麼呢？因爲第一，這些學童，天眞純潔，他們唯一的希望就是有讀書機會，所以不辭風寒，靜必鵠候，兒童有這樣普遍的求學慾現象，語云：「留得靑山在，不怕沒柴燒」，可知中國前途尙有可爲。第二，誰無子女，孰不愛護，子女肯求學，父兄焉有人心令之失學之理。可是，爲了生活擔子的重壓，資在沒有餘力負擔子女敎育之費，不得巳忍心令之失學。今旣有助學金機會，自然不辭辛苦，携令子女申請，這種父兄期望子女求學的殷切現象，也是同樣値得重視的。</p>
<p>上屆受助學生共四千餘人，本屆索取申請表的新舊生計第一日九千餘份，第二日四千餘份，第三日三千餘份，綜計一萬六千餘份，超過上屆四倍。這一事實，說明了物價愈高，生活愈艱，學生失學的機會就愈多。</p>
<p>此外，我們近來接觸很多朋友，都是知識階級而有正當職業的，對於子女敎育本報辦理助學金是依照「淸寒優秀」四個一樣；不合標準，誰也無法通融。况且本報助學金限於小學五年級開始，五年級以下，就是合乎標準，也無法接受。不過，我們感覺一般知識階級的朋友，對於子女的敎育費無法籌措，坐視失學，內心的痛苦，更爲深刻。</p>
<p>我們認爲以團體力量辦理助學運動，小免有杯水車薪之感。而使學齡兒童都有就學機會，這是國家應有的責任。因此，我們迫切的向政府當局　負責敎育當局呼　，希望密切注視目前的嚴重現象，最低限度第一步普設國民小學，一律免費，使每個兒童，都有接受小學教育的機會，盼望政府立具决心，從下學期起即行辦理，各地公立小學，免費當無問題，私立小學一雜由政府津貼經費，規定全行免費。我們相信祗須政府具備决心，實施時的經費問題，必可迎刃而解的。</p>
<p>近世各先進國，對於國民義務敎育，莫不盡力普及，尤以中小學敎育，人民都有接受機會，抑且政府强迫接受，所以，文盲極少而國民知識日高，國力以强。我國文盲之多，在平時學費低廉之時，固早已令人咋舌，今情勢益趨嚴重，原有就小學之機會者，也將剝奪，後果之惡，不寒而　。深信政府當局，尤以身負敎育責任者，必有深見達慮，　不勉力設法，急起圖之呢？</p>
<h3>中儲與正金銀行簽集中通匯協定　華中華南與南方實施通匯</h3>
<p>中央社訊　中央儲備銀行爲協力發展大東亞各地城之貿易圓滑起見，經與盟邦執有權威之橫濱正金銀行數度妥商，集中華中華南與南方地城　兌制度，業於昨（十一）日上午十一時在上海外灘中央儲備銀行上海分行會議廳，與橫濱正金銀行簽訂協定，計到有中儲銀行爲總裁佛海，顧問木村吉川，及日方積極正進銀行，台灣銀行，帝國銀行等代表簽字，茲將事實極重華中華南與南方地域匯兌要綱，及中儲周總裁佛海氏發表談話，分誌如下：</p>
<p>實施要綱</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行實施集中中華南與南方地域匯兌之要綱：一·中央儲備銀行極重對南方地域之買賣兌·一·南方地域匯兌均以日本圓表示之。一·中央　備銀行在正金銀行東京支店設特別圓戶，辦理對南方地域匯兌。一·南方地域匯兌經辦銀行之對顧客匯兌換算率買賣，均以中儲券百元折合日本圓十八圖計算之，但經辦銀行得向顧客收取匯兌買賣總額萬分之五十之手續費，其中萬分之二五，須繳交中儲作爲補償費。一·經辦南方匯兌銀行，應於每旬末總結一次，將匯兌賞賣尚中儲套買套賣之。一·對南方地城匯兌之集中，目下祗限於中央儲備銀行外匯局，至於其他谷地分行之匯兌買資，均應以中央儲備釵行外匯局開戶辦理，並須一律向中儲套買套賣之。一。關於其他事項，暫照現行辦法辦理，並由中儲與日方協力雙方隨時密切連絡。</p>
<p>周總裁談</p>
<p>關於華中華難於南方地域通匯事宜，頃中央儲備銀行總裁　佛海氏，發表談話如下；「此次華中南經」辦南方地域匯兌銀行，對於該地匯兌資金集中於木行一節，今日已與橫濱正金銀行簽訂協定，同時與各經辦南方匯兌銀行，亦已簽訂有關資金集中之備忘錄，本人深感慶幸之至。本行成立以來，三載於茲，中儲券幸得充分發揮國內通貨之機能，現在復因集中制度之實現，中儲券在本行統制下，又可謂兼備貿易通貨之職能。目下華中華南對於大東亞各地城之交易，正極切盼望其圓滑，本行所負中央銀行之使命，自將益　重大矣」。</p>
<p>中央社滬訊　關於中央儲備銀行集中辦理南方匯兌事，上海日大使館事務所當局，發表談話如次：此次中央儲備銀行實施華中華南對南方匯兌之集中制度，結果法幣已能充分具備國內統一通貨，並爲對外經濟通貨之機能，於促進對南方交易上，實有極大裨益。又今後對南方地域匯兌，均以日圓表示，其匯率進出，俱爲法幣白兀折日圓十八圓法幣之對外價値，更吿明確，此點尤値注目。我日本方面對此次中央儲備銀行集中辦理南方匯兌，决予全而協力，並指導日方匯兌銀行，充分協力，使該項集中制度，順利推進，深信實施集中南方匯兌，必能獲得中國經濟界之良好反響。</p>

<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：義大利戰綫德軍已由距卡西諾六英里之聖維多爾SanVittore撤退。</p>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　路透社記者布拉溫十日報道德軍已在義大利戰綫開始强烈反攻之消息，謂德軍已對馬獄山美第五軍陣地開始猛烈反攻，該山位於聖維多爾北方四英里，海拔四千英尺，爲北略加茲希之咽喉，形勢甚爲重要。又德軍於其他處亦對美第五軍開始反攻</p>
<p>舶林十一日中央社電　據海通社訊美第五軍於米納諾至卡西諾之公路之北廣二十公里之戰錢上大舉進攻，自一月四日起連續三日，至第四日已達最猛烈點，但第五日後其勢又趨鬆弛。此次進攻僅奪得廢棄之聖維多爾村及附近之高地，總計僅推進三公里而已。德軍沿山佈置梯形防綫，不易攻破，德軍雖略受損失，但防禦力仍安然無恙，現已撤至維的古索基伐洛之東預先佈就之防錢繼續守禦，敵軍何時始能再度進攻，現尙木悉。至於其他各綫，新年來未有獎動。</p>

<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：蘇軍部隊巳到達舊波蘭國境內二十五英里之薩爾尼地方。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　烏克蘭戰綫近兩日來風雪交加，氣溫已降至零下六度，但企圖包圍聶伯河彎曲部德軍之蘇軍，與奮勇抵抗之德軍仍在長達五百公里之戰綫上到處展開血戰。又蘇軍爲奪取烏克蘭幹綫之奧迪薩與克拉科間鐵路以隔斷德軍後方，已於十日自東南北三方面進行包圍維尼薩市（Vinnitsa）同時並在　茂林加（Zhmerinka）與波洛斯科洛夫（Proskurv）之間積極向貝薩拉比亞國境方面進攻，但德軍反攻力亦隨戰局之推移而增强，現已於布格河沿岸一帶佈成堅陣，以備正面阻止蘇軍之進攻。又另一部蘇軍尾追自基洛伏格勒撤退之德軍，十日已進抵該市北方之阿勒庫塞夫加及西南方廿公里之伊伐諾夫加，欲將克里伏浴格之德軍包圍。蘇軍之作戰倘能成功，則事態將趨嚴重化，德軍當局亦已承認事態之重大，並實行縮短富於粘性之戰錢，同時並增加預備兵力，以期將蘇軍各個擊破，戰局頃已日見激化。</p>
<h3>英機侵犯領空　瑞典提抗議</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據倫敦息：瑞典駐倫敦公使對本月六日英機侵入瑞境一事，已向英政府提出抗議。</p>
<h3>英美誘脅下土仍守中立</h3>
<p>斯丹埠十一日中央社電　英美兩國自召開德黑蘭會談後，即以種種手叚壓迫土耳其政府，力謀使土國參加反軸心陣營，然該國似仍持謹愼態度，注視戰局推移。近英軍事使節團抵德　闌，已着手調查土國內之軍事設施及空軍基地等，又新任地中海方面最高司令官威爾遜，近亦抵安加拉，傳英軍事使節抵土，即英强壓土國之先端。最近安加拉及斯丹埠兩市英籍技師及工人激增，此等英人似係從。又土駐英大使愛爾貝，最近返抵安加拉，策謀加强英土關係，致各方盛傳土政府有改組說，然自現狀觀之，土國尙無即時參戰之意。而吾人於判斷土國態度時，須注意東綫南部蘇軍之攻勢與蘇波料紛兩點，現蘇軍不欲繼續展開東綫南部之攻勢，且英美兩國對蘇波糾紛竟出以輕視熊度，因此衆料土國必仍堅持其中立國之政策。傳開羅會談時土國總理曾對英美代表提出兩難題，以爲土國參戰之前提，　即土國增加軍需品之供給，　驅逐愛琴海及巴爾幹半島等地德軍之支配權。以上條件，自不能實現</p>
<h3>傳美擬與蘇　訂立協定　保持永久和平</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦每日郵報紐約特派員稱：美國或將與蘇聯訂立協定，圖避免第三次世紀大戰。政界人士對國務院所主持之數次演講，極為主義，聞演講時屢次涉及此項協定，其草案乃係由赫爾自莫斯科携歸。</p>
<p>蘇波兩國關係微妙</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據海通社訊，德國外交部稱：倫敦「觀察報」外交訪員發表蘇波邊界爭端之消息，蘇聯立即加以否認，蘇聯與英美之關係不難　見一斑。該訪員提及蘇聯建議，依照一九二〇年所謂「寇松」界綫劃定蘇波邊界，而以德國領土補償波蘭之失地。德國外交部以爲「觀察報」外交訪員發表此項消息，或係先獲英美權威方面之諒解或暗示。衆信英美希望討論蘇波邊界爭端，而蘇聯之否認顯示蘇聯不欲討論此項問題。德外部幷提及最近瑞典報紙對於蘇聯不欲利用民主國對蘇聯之有益以遂其慾一節，表示驚異，然事實恰與之相反，蘇聯不特不遷就反軸心各國，幷置其反誼於不顧也。瑞典報紙之言論顯示中立國民衆對於蘇聯之眞正見解常懐錯覺。</p>
<h3>義叛逆案審結　齊亞諾處死刑</h3>
<p>凡洛那十一日中央社電　據海通社訊：齊亞諾及前法西斯大議會議員十七人簽字反對墨索里尼，卒造成七月二十五日之變一案，經此間特別法院審訊完畢，已於昨日判决齊亞諾及其他議員共十八人被處死刑，處服苦役三十年者一人。被吿親自到庭者僅齊亞諾。波諾元帥·及前議員馬利奎·巴雷西·柯特哈地等五人，除前職團部次官齊亞奈蒂被處服苦役三十年外，其餘被吿悉被判决死刑。</p>
<h3>決戰前夕　德國的防禦力量</h3>
<p>朝日新聞社駐柏林守山特派員近會旅行中立國西班牙及葡萄牙方面，歷時約一月，於年末歸抵柏林。見到這二個伊比利亞的國家之後，深感今日在歐洲爭着民族存亡的大勝負者，是德意志人，英吉利人及俄羅斯人的三大强國。在今日的歐洲，所謂節操，恩義，眞理，一切的東西，在變幻無極的正濤中，如無根的海藻般漂浮着。大西洋憲章也好，新秩序宣言也好，其他幾百種宣傳和討論也好，都在這滔滔的狂濤中流動着，結果，終究不能突破「强者支配」這頗爲簡單而千古不滅的鐵則。換言之，歐洲戰爭的現階段，走着頗如物理的過程，强的力製造環境，環境規定人類的思想。那麼，德國的力，及從外壓迫之的蘇聯和英美的力，在目前的歐洲戰塲上，起者怎樣的力學的現象呢？在這裹，我們不能不產直地承認，自飽爾斯兀帥的德第六軍在斯達林格勒悲壯殉國以來，這一年閒，德國無論在東戰綫，南戰綫，或空中第三戰錢，所走的路是非常困難的。有較多武器而造成優勢的力，占有利的地位，歐洲戰爭正走上這條件的世界。</p>
<p>當祖國危難之際，以肉彈突擊敵戰艦，這在日本人眼中已成爲常識，所以見到這歐洲的「常識的世界」，就難於理解。可是我們先須知道，在原則上，歐洲的戰塲上是沒有奇蹟的</p>
<p>現實進向常識的勝利</p>
<p>歐洲大戰跟着新年進到第六年了，歐洲大戰不久將突入决戰期。雙方互相堅决的形勢，立在四角，即將决定最後的輸贏。且那並不是在角力塲的正中排成四角，敵我雙方所排列的位置，常成角力塲的邊上移動着。從那裏聽到的喘息聲極迫促，對方所受的打學固深，友方所經騐的磨鍊亦極深刻。遇到這種現實，還再不能不相信「常識的勝利」或「物理的力之勝利」，則歐洲戰爭實是一齣悲劇。</p>
<p>但這裏不能不指出，日本人所常有的英雄主義的思想，孕育者錯估歐洲戰爭前途的危險·曾經把歐洲新秩序的根源放在軍事力上的德國的想法是對的，德國始終相信必須用力來戰勝敵人，　壓倒敵人·百種的宣傳和說法，不及一次小的軍事的勝利。從伊比利亞的中立國眺望敵情，回顧德國，再歸返轟炸下的柏林，記者最强烈地感到的就是這一點。</p>
<p>防禦力上所見的德國力量</p>
<p>然則曾在六個星期中使法國投降的德國的力最，如今在那裏工作呢？在積極的攻擊力的形式上，不能見到這力量，但我們在目前的防禦力中發見這力量·在廣大的東部戰錢上，死命阻止優勢蘇聯軍的猛壓，毅然答覆突刺柏林心臟部的恐怖轟炸，這力量，在某種意義上可以說比當時在六星期間使法國屈服的德國力量更爲强靱。我們見到與三年前不同形式的德國力量。換言之，那就是「頑抗」。那不是馳驅嚴塲的閃電戰，敵我都立在角力塲的邊上苦戰着。在那裏表現出來的德國的粘靱力，使我們驚嘆，而最震驚的大約是敵人自身。前次大戰中，用食糧封鎖的飢饉戰使德國民衆從內部崩潰，此次敵人的計策，用恐怖轟炸代替食糧封鎖，而企圖同樣的效果</p>
<p>一九四三年中，德軍公報中稱有大小五十四都市蒙受恐怖轟炸的慘禍，其中以柏林爲最甚，前後經十三次大空襲，投下炸彈計一萬數千噸，是以今日柏林的一部完全被破壞，柏林繁華的街上，見到經數十日激戰後化爲焦土的閘北和楊樹浦的同樣情景。柏林的每一個市民，痛切地感到在第一戰綫戰爭的印象·漢堡及萊因地方的小都市已經有七百萬市民，向德國國內移動，尋覓別的安全的地方，在一夜之間，幾十萬人的家室被燬，衣履不全的狼狽出走的慘劇，如在平時，早就變成叛亂或暴動了。</p>
<p>沮喪戰意的企圖失敗</p>
<p>警察力和維持秩序的組織已經確立，使老幼婦孺安全避難，食宿等應急救濟設備無不具備。戰時下每一個德國市民，尙維持着極旺盛的士氣。在漢堡亦是這樣。敵人的恐怖轟炸的目標之一，如其是要使德國民衆的士氣沮喪，那是不會完成的。一九四〇年，德國也曾轟炸倫敦，以爲可使英國人放棄戰意，然而那是錯覺，現在英美空軍正復重蹈覆轍。在目前的階段，關於轟炸如欲得一結諭，則使荷蘭。比利時等小國人民喪失戰意是可能的，但欲使如英德等大國人民單由轟炸使三十戰意是不可能的，在某種塲合，反造成相反的效果，使對方的戰意愈爲强硬。雖似繞道，轟炸似祗應集中於破壞敵的軍事設施或軍需工業力（翔：譯自一月一日西部朝日新開）</p>

<h3>向慨捐助學金諸君致敬</h3>
<p>本報續者助學金第六屆申請表，已於八日至十日三日間分發，擁擠情形，出乎預料，共發出新舊生一萬六千餘份，我們的願望，台乎標準者都能受助，可是，問題在於助金數額的足够與否，原擬三百萬元，尙不敷分配，因此連日向讀者呼籲，慷慨捐助。</p>

<h3>獻機盃足球賽　中華克義聯　三比二義球拍賣念萬元</h3>
<p>本市民衆獻機運動委員會主催之獻機盃足球義賽，昨日下午三時起在逸園球塲交鋒，由中華出戰義聯，陳市長親臨開球，及丁部長主持拍賣養球與給獎，義賣聲起，競購極度熱烈，結果終由六合社突破義球拍賣之最高紀錄，中華軍賴球運亨通，以三對二敗義聯，由隊長李寗得錦標歸。</p>
<p>球運關係</p>
<p>昨役義聯雖遭慘敗，唯精神及毅力，遠勝中華，格於球運奇劣，敗陣喪師個人技術，義聯後衛麥各自爲政，有群龍無首之感，中衛綫合作默契，後衛祺祥與李寗球路不同，　合作可言，下半時祺祥與張林根互調，局勢漸見好轉。</p>
<p>比賽過程</p>
<p>開始接觸大義聯攻勢，盛，鋒芒萬丈，八分鐘迪盤那金鷄獨立，凌空勾中，劉顯漢措手不及，中華首先失利。越四分鐘。中華全部總動員出動，宋靈聖華容擋道，截得來球，傳遞許文奎，球越最後防線，李　頭上開花，角度準備，麥尼蒂捨命撲救，已吿不及，扳成平手。距十分鐘吳祺祥弄巧成拙，演成倒戈請客，劉縣漢過於大意，應負一半責任。事過境遷，許文奎穩取荊州，上半時各獲二球，評分秋色。易地後，雙方均全力以赴，戰局由鬆弛而緊張，　永福孫錦順賣幼良，均有傑構，未能立功，未久義聯羅旭萊禁區犯規，被判十二碼球，由孫錦順蹴入成三對二，後來居上，時間吿終，中華以三對二克服義聯。</p>

<h3>市民福利協會呈請　嚴厲監督航政　免蹈華泰輪覆轍</h3>
<p>本市市民福利協會鑒於華泰輪覆沒慘案，由於航政局監督不力，爲免蹈覆轍，特呈請交通財政兩部，嚴飭關係機關嚴厲執行，原文如下：「呈爲華泰覆舟慘案，由於航政監督不力，懇請嚴飭海關，轉飭航政局嚴屬執行，以事豫防而弭覆轍事：竊查本市中華輪船公司之華泰輪船，於上年十二月九日夜七時半，在新港江面失事，航員乘客，遭難溺斃，查明有七百餘人之多，爲近年來航行界空前之浩刧。其傾覆之原因，公司方面，諉過於乘客不守秩序，未待船內乘客登岸，即蜂擁而上，因此上下旅客，皆羣集於船身之一面，以致船傾進水，奔流甚猛，無法制止。據脫險歸來旅客所述目覩情形，則謂乘客以單帮客人佔大多數，所携貨物，堆置艙面，非待船員談妥條件，收到規費，不令入艙，因此上重下輕，船身傾斜，致遭覆沒。而據航政當局則認爲該船傾覆，載重超過規定限額一倍以上，實爲主因，船員不遵定章，未受檢定，對於駕駛管理，亦有乘方之處。綜合三方談話，參互以觀，則此次肇事之原因，自應各負其責任。但是乘客方面之不守秩序，擁軋凌亂，以及携帶貨物，堆積艙面等種種，則由於該公司船員指導之無方，但知婪索，以剝削旅客爲目的，而不知船員有爲行旅服勞之義務，自不能全歸咎於旅客之市輪渡駁船之東昌丸，裝客四百〇二名，將所載木材，堆積船頂，成上重下輕之勢，船一掉頭，適有風浪，即行傾側，乘客紛紛跌入浦江，與此次華泰輪船，事同一轍，乃本案發生未久，該輪船公司，復有安和輪船，於十二月十四日午後二時，到達新港，又爲三四十隻　　船夫攀登而上，以致船身傾　，立呈險象，幸隣舟援救，使得無事，據此以觀，覆舟之禍，可以隨時發生，安得不痛定思痛，本會員等鑒於此次慘案，爲懲前　候之計，用特　懇鈞部請賜嚴飭江海關，轉飭航政局，對於各輪船公如船員技術之應受檢定，額之不准超越，以及各地物資，如何暢利疏通，免使小商冒險圓利，里夜江心，應擇便利地點，飭該公司籌築碼頭，或建造臺船，以期行旅之上下安全，與其爲事候之補　，無爲人民多盡一分心力，則人民自能多得一分福利，務使國家之法律，勿等於具文，重大之慘案，勿使再現於社會，是本會同人所期望者也。至華泰遭難無辦法，應請嚴飭從速辦理。本會見聞所及，難安部鑒核訓示施行。謹呈交通部·財政部。</p>

<h3>生產總動員</h3>
<p>昨言國府參戰進入第二年，主席聲明今年的一年，當以增產運動爲重點中之重點，茲再就盟邦日本田尻公使一昨對於「增强生產運動」之廣播演說，加以我們一點擁護的詞調。</p>
<p>田尻公使認爲目前非係空言談論時期，凡各業八員均應團結一致，發揮全力，從事研究生產之增强，我們很欣幸地感覺昨天我們所引：「爲政不在多言，而在力行」一句話，正如田尻公使所言，如出一轍。總之一句話，空言增產，已成過去，今後是生產總動員的時期，無論以前爲投身生產事業或爲厠身不生產事業者，今後均須一齊走向增强生產運動之旗織下來集合，獻身爲生產綫上之產業戰士，正如田尻公使所言：「勿容有一人之落伍」，那方才是生產總動員。</p>
<p>生產總動員以後的最先條件，則爲生產方法之積極改善，而其途徑則不外於：　在管理方面，今後各工廠必須力求其科學化，無論爲人事，設備，機械，資材，運轉，務求在減少消耗與增强效力的兩個條件下，爲最圓滑的運營，　在工作方面，今後各工廠的經理，廠長以及工人，必須分別努力於其本位以內的工作，絲亳勿爲本位工作以外的一切思相與活動所擾亂；做經理的專心於生產的籌劃，做廠長的專心於生產的管理，做工人的專心於生產機械與器具的使用，那末，增强生產運動，方始可以收到最圓滿的結果，以貢獻於產業共榮之圈！</p>

<h3>華股突轉高翔　永安等老股重爲殷富投資目標</h3>
<p>華股投資目標近又轉移於大部份老股，因之連日蓬勃上升，中額及小額新股已轉呈平淡。百貨業之永安公司旣爲有組織者進提，並聞即將增資爲額萬萬元，價在買風中由二百〇七元半，步升至二百三十元，軋升二十二元半之巨，收後更做升至二百三十四元有求無供，新新等隨之躍上；紡織業仍推中國絲業飛升七十七元半爲最巨，美亞於午收時突出二百元關，下午更步升不回，與永安紗廠各升十五元左右；振豐棉織增資，認送各一股消息，已經證實，飛升六元半；文化股頗爲堅定；新藥業信誼飛升八十二元半，叩五百元，餘則升降均微；化工股挺秀，明屋香水較隔日漲起不少；公用股成交極稀；地產股平疲；其他利亞實業升三元半，三樂實業站住原價，久安等升降較微；康元製罐堅定。今誌收盤市傻於後：</p>
<h3>取締遠期本票　辦法商妥</h3>
<p>關於取締各金融機關遠期本果案、銀錢業同業公會曾陳述意見，請求中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務所採納，頃經商妥取締遠期本票原則，先由銀錢兩業通吿會員切實遵照，然後再行洽辦。</p>
<h3>商號增資升股須遵部令辦理</h3>
<p>昨據市商會負責人語稱。凡各公司商號擬欲增以資本額或升股者，必須遵照實業部頒佈辦法辦理續者，可逕向該會商務科咨詢，即予詳細解答，按公司商號增資升股，固屬合理，倘漫無止境，　害商市發展，亦多關係云。</p>
<h3>糧統會擬設大規模農塲</h3>
<p>糧統會內部機構，業經確立，積極展開米糧統制運營工作。近擬設大規模農塲，求農產之改進，以改良農業技術，指導農村經織爲目的，經費每且二十萬元至五十萬元，農塲將設立於蘇州附近。</p>

<h3>改善鐵道交通治標方面</h3>
<p>— 王偉英</p>
<p>華中鐵道公司最近改選交通界先進鄭洪年氏担任總裁，銳意改善棄亂已久的鐵道交通，俾以減輕行旅痛苦，誠不失為當局者賢的措　。</p>
<p>無可否認的，目下交通問題根本的　結，在於單幫販戶的大量活動，所以對症下藥，消滅販戶足以治本，可是這有涉政治，姑且擱開。</p>
<p>至於治標之道　意有二：（甲）絕對禁止乘客携帶行李，祇准單身搭車人無法身帶物件，　如委托旅行社代運，一則不能獲得厚利，二則增加手續，多費時日，必非彼　所願，　統制機關撿易較易，　於普通乘客並無不利便處。（乙）車票除年月日外，加注列車班次，並不拘頭二三四各等，一例封號人座；或三四等客票較多則可變通加印節車番號，不得混用。如此則　一客票保證有座位可佔，必可稍滅目下秩序之　亂程度。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>立志（二）</p>
<p>到秋天學期開始的時候，眞人費盡苦心的日光浴，發生了效果，獲得了菊池少佐的誇獎。同時也受到了同學們的嘲笑。</p>
<p>「看哪！蘋果變成黑的了，好一份燃蘋果啊。」</p>
<p>那時候，在街上的喫茶店裏流行着燒蘋果</p>
<p>「哼……」眞人毫不介意地含笑着。這也是因爲他根本就不知道甚麼呌燒蘋果。他向來不在外邊買東西吃的。雖然是因爲袋子裏的錢不多，尤其是他母親不喜歡那種行爲的緣故</p>
<p>在新學期的開始·眞人就被選爲副組長。音樂的點數雖然不好，而數學和英語的成績，確是出類拔萃的。所以纔有了這樣的結果。</p>
<p>「那很好……」母親也很喜歡地，買來呌着「春駒」的組點心，給他慶祝。</p>
<p>毋親——世界上有比母親還好的人麼？眞人對母親的愛慕心，近夾越發地深切了。現在已經明白母親不顧一切地，只有爲兒女爲家庭而奮鬥的心情了。母親所以自已穿着襤褸的衣服，而使太郎和眞人穿着整齊的服裝的原因，也了解了。假使父親還在世上的話，總不會這樣深切地理解母親的心——</p>
<p>「媽媽的飯，我結您盛吧！」有一天早晨，一家團聚，早餐的時侯，眞人這樣的說着，把飯桶拖到自己的身旁。</p>
<p>「男孩子，用不着做那樣的事情。」母親輕輕地申叱着。實際還有松枝，加代，秋菊等女侍，人手很多呢。</p>
<p>人沒得面子，紅着臉兒。</p>
<p>「那麼，就盛一盌……」這樣說來，母親也無法拒絕，把飯盌交給了他，　人好像示敬意的程度似的。盛了滿滿地一盌。</p>
<p>「噢，這可　不得了，……」母親不知怎麼接過來好，但長臉上却現着笑容。</p>
<p>從那以後，眞人對飯盒裏的菜，再也不說不滿意的話了。就是只有幾塊籮　鹹菜，也沒有不平的時候，吃完了的時候，好像洗過了似的潔凈，逋飯粒一個也不留。那是因爲注意到姐姐們整理時免去麻煩。有時候蹲在井邊上洗着自己的　東西。手法也相當地熱練。總而言之，眞人是一個很可欽佩的少年。但是他這可欽佩的地方，並不能得到母親的歡心。</p>

<h3>An Urgent Appeal: Requesting the Government to Exempt National Elementary School Tuition</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War Common Knowledge Exhibition held by this newspaper lasted for three days. Coincidentally, the sixth round of scholarship applications began. We took advantage of the exhibition venue to distribute scholarship application forms, hoping that students could also visit the exhibition and gain some wartime knowledge. Unexpectedly, the crowds over the three days exceeded our expectations, deeply moving us. We believe that not only those who witnessed it firsthand were moved, but also those who heard the news would be touched and enlightened. Why? Firstly, these students are innocent and pure, their only hope is to have the opportunity to study. Therefore, they braved the wind and cold, waiting patiently. Such a widespread phenomenon of children desiring education shows that "while the green hills remain, there is no fear of lacking firewood." It shows that China's future still holds promise. Secondly, who doesn't have children, and who doesn't love them? If children are willing to study, no parent or elder brother would heartlessly deprive them of their education. However, due to the heavy burden of life, there is no extra money to bear the cost of their children's education, and they are forced to cruelly deprive them of their education. Now that there is a scholarship opportunity, they naturally don't hesitate to work hard, bringing their children to apply. This ardent phenomenon of fathers and elder brothers hoping their children can study is also equally worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In the previous round, more than 4,000 students received assistance. In this round, the number of new and returning students requesting application forms totaled over 9,000 on the first day, over 4,000 on the second day, and over 3,000 on the third day, totaling over 16,000, more than four times the previous round. This fact illustrates that as prices rise and life becomes more difficult, there are more opportunities for students to drop out of school.</p>
<p>In addition, we have recently contacted many friends who are intellectuals with legitimate professions. Regarding the scholarships provided by this newspaper for their children's education, it is based on the four criteria of "poor and outstanding". If they do not meet the standards, no one can be accommodated. Moreover, this newspaper's scholarships are limited to students starting from the fifth grade of elementary school. Even if they meet the standards, we cannot accept those below the fifth grade. However, we feel that the inner pain of the general intellectual class of friends who cannot raise the education fees for their children and watch them drop out of school is even more profound.</p>
<p>We believe that providing scholarships through group efforts has a limited effect, like a cup of water on a burning cart of wood. Ensuring that all school-age children have the opportunity to attend school is the responsibility of the state. Therefore, we urgently appeal to the government authorities and the education authorities, hoping that they will pay close attention to the current serious phenomenon. At the very least, as a first step, universally establish national elementary schools and make them all free, so that every child has the opportunity to receive elementary school education. We hope that the government will make a firm decision and implement it starting from the next semester. There should be no problem with free education in public elementary schools in various regions. Private elementary schools should be subsidized by the government and required to provide free education across the board. We believe that as long as the government has the determination, the funding problems during implementation will definitely be solved easily.</p>
<p>In modern advanced countries, they all strive to popularize national compulsory education, especially primary and secondary education. People have the opportunity to receive education, and the government even forces them to accept it. Therefore, there are very few illiterate people, and the national knowledge is increasing day by day, and the national strength is strong. The number of illiterate people in our country was already staggering when tuition fees were low in peacetime. Now the situation is becoming more and more serious, and even those who originally had the opportunity to attend elementary school will be deprived of it. The consequences are frightening. We deeply believe that the government authorities, especially those responsible for education, must have profound insights and far-reaching considerations, and will they not make every effort to find ways and take urgent action?</p>
<h3>The Central Reserve Bank and Yokohama Specie Bank Sign a Centralized Remittance Agreement: Implementing Remittances in Central China, South China, and the South</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: In order to facilitate the development of trade in various cities of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Central Reserve Bank, after several consultations with the Allied Yokohama Specie Bank, which holds authority, has centralized the exchange system in Central China, South China, and the South. The agreement was signed with the Yokohama Specie Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday (11th) in the conference hall of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank on the Bund in Shanghai. Those present included the President of the Central Reserve Bank, Fo Hai, advisors Kimura and Yoshikawa, and representatives of the actively progressive Japanese banks, Taiwan Bank, and Teikoku Bank. The key points of the remittance in the Central China, South China, and Southern regions, as well as the speech delivered by President Zhou Fo Hai of the Central Reserve Bank, are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Key Points of Implementation</p>
<p>Key points of the Central Reserve Bank's implementation of centralized remittance in the Central China, South China, and Southern regions: 1. The Central Reserve Bank attaches great importance to the buying and selling of exchange in the Southern region. 2. Remittances in the Southern region are expressed in Japanese Yen. 3. The Central Reserve Bank will set up a special Yen account in the Tokyo branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank to handle remittances to the Southern region. 4. The exchange rates for remittance transactions between the banks handling remittances in the Southern region and their customers will be calculated based on 100 Central Reserve Bank notes being equivalent to 18 Japanese Yen. However, the banks handling the transactions can charge customers a handling fee of 0.05% of the total amount of the remittance transactions, of which 0.025% must be paid to the Central Reserve Bank as compensation. 5. Banks handling remittances in the Southern region should summarize once at the end of each ten-day period and buy and sell the remittances to the Central Reserve Bank. 6. The centralization of remittances to the Southern region is currently limited to the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Reserve Bank. As for the remittance transactions of other branch banks, they should be handled by opening accounts with the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Reserve Bank, and all transactions must be bought and sold to the Central Reserve Bank. 7. Other matters will be handled in accordance with the current procedures for the time being, and the Central Reserve Bank and the Japanese side will maintain close contact at all times.</p>
<p>President Zhou's Remarks</p>
<p>Regarding the communication of remittances between Central China and the South, President Fo Hai of the Central Reserve Bank delivered the following remarks: "The banks in Central China that handle remittances in the Southern region have reached an agreement with the Yokohama Specie Bank today regarding the centralization of remittance funds in the banking sector. At the same time, a memorandum of understanding regarding the centralization of funds has also been signed with the banks handling remittances in the South. I am deeply gratified. Since its establishment three years ago, the Central Reserve Bank has been fortunate to fully exert the function of domestic currency. Now, with the realization of the centralization system, it can be said that the Central Reserve Bank note also possesses the function of trade currency under the control of this bank. Currently, Central China and South China are eagerly anticipating the smooth flow of transactions in various cities of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The mission of the Central Reserve Bank, as a central bank, will naturally be even more important."</p>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the Central Reserve Bank's centralized handling of remittances in the South, the authorities of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office issued the following statement: "The implementation of the centralized system for Central China and South China's remittances to the South by the Central Reserve Bank has resulted in the legal tender fully possessing the function of a unified domestic currency and an external economic currency, which is of great benefit to promoting trade with the South. Furthermore, remittances to the Southern region will be expressed in Japanese Yen, and the exchange rate fluctuations will be the external value of 18 Japanese Yen per 100 legal tender, which is even more noteworthy. Japan fully supports the Central Reserve Bank's centralized handling of remittances and will guide Japanese remittance banks to fully cooperate to ensure the smooth advancement of the centralized system. It is deeply believed that the implementation of centralized remittances in the South will receive a positive response from the Chinese economic community."</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Attack Suichuan Airport</h3>
<p>Hankou, November 11th, Central News Agency: Japanese planes, in combined large formations of fighters and bombers, attacked Suichuan Airport in Jiangxi Province several times from the night of the 10th to the 11th. They engaged in aerial combat with more than ten Chongqing planes that intercepted them.

<p>Hankou, November 11th, Central News Agency: A combined formation of nine U.S. Air Force fighter and bomber aircraft stationed in Chongqing attacked a location near Dali, upstream of Jiujiang, at 2:00 PM on the 10th.

<h3>Hong Kong Indian Volunteers Actively Train</h3>

<h3>Japan's Third "Patriotic" Coastal Defense Ship Launched: Suppressing Submarine Warfare Will Be Further Developed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a Nagasaki telephone report, the "Patriotic Third Ship Coastal Defense Ship," built with donations from 100 million Japanese people, held its launching ceremony at a certain shipyard in Kyushu.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: The first Japanese coastal defense ship was launched in the old brain. Recently, its second and third ships have also been completed one after another. Many countries use old first-line warships as coastal defense ships. However, the Japanese Navy was the first to design and build new warships with excellent performance to serve as coastal defense ships. Its equipment is naturally stronger and more powerful than previous coastal defense ships. The successive launching of Japanese "Patriotic Coastal Defense Ships" proves that Japan still has a great shipbuilding capacity under this profound war situation. At the same time, due to the construction of coastal defense ships, the Japanese Navy has decided to actively defend the territorial waters and prevent the enemy's submarines from traveling between Japan and the mainland or between Japan and various southern regions. It is almost impossible to completely prevent the enemy's submarines from traveling to the East. However, due to the progress of various weapons, which is changing with each passing day, there will be a leap in submarine tactics in the future. The position of today's sharp coastal defense ships is extremely important.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army's War Results in Various Provinces of North China</h3>

<h3>Army Department Holds Weapons Conference</h3>

<h3>German Troops in Italian Mountains Launch Fierce Counteroffensive: Arranging Echeloned Fortifications That Are Indestructible</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to the German military authorities: German troops on the Italian front have withdrawn from San Vittore, six miles from Cassino.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency: Reuters reporter Brown reported on the 10th that the German army has launched a strong counteroffensive on the Italian front, saying that the German army has launched a fierce counteroffensive against the positions of the U.S. Fifth Army on Mount Magugu, which is located four miles north of San Vittore, 4,000 feet above sea level, and is the throat of northern Latzshi, which is very important. The German army also launched a counteroffensive against the U.S. Fifth Army in other places.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, the U.S. Fifth Army launched a large-scale offensive on a 20-kilometer-wide battle line north of the highway from Minano to Cassino. It lasted for three consecutive days from January 4th and reached its most intense point on the fourth day, but its momentum weakened after the fifth day. This offensive only captured the abandoned village of San Vittore and the nearby heights, advancing only three kilometers in total. The German army has deployed echeloned defense lines along the mountains, which are not easy to break through. Although the German army has suffered some losses, its defensive power remains intact. It has now withdrawn to the pre-arranged defense lines east of Vidigusokifaaro to continue to defend. It is still unknown when the enemy army will be able to launch another offensive. As for other fronts, there have been no awards since the new year.</p>
<h3>Peace Proposal Said: German Side Denies</h3>

Those who spread this rumor and repeatedly mention Bata are trying to make readers more easily deceived. This rumor is often repeated by the enemy after a considerable period of time."</p>
<h3>The German Governor-General of Poland's Letter to the Polish People</h3>
<p>Krakow, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency: The Polish people are eagerly awaiting news that will determine their fate. Many people gather to listen to the loudspeakers set up on the streets. The general public generally believes that the fate of their country has been decided. No matter what the outcome of the war, Poland will not become an independent country in the end. Only a small part of the Polish people welcome the entry of the Soviet army due to Pan-Slavic and communist ideas. However, they also do not know whether Moscow is willing to accept their cooperation, or whether there is already a Polish regime in Moscow. Due to this hesitation, many guerrillas are entrenched in the forests of eastern Poland. Their activities are mostly small-scale, such as attacking German sesame cake farms. The German Governor-General of Poland, Frank, issued a letter to the Polish people, saying that the sincere Polish farmers, businessmen, and public and private employees can be seen from their usual attitude that they only seek to live and work in peace and participate in the common work of Europe in order to restore peace as soon as possible. The Governor-General's Office is responsible for repeatedly stating that those who participate in such work will definitely be understood by the German authorities. In order to protect these law-abiding people, the authorities will do their best to put out the terrorists who are disrupting order. It must be known that violent actions are not enough to write to the German authorities, but are enough to endanger the safety of the Polish people. However, the German army on the Eastern Front is the only force to prevent the red imperialists from ravaging Poland.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army on the Eastern Front Conducting an Encirclement Maneuver: Advancing Towards Bessarabia</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to the German military authorities: Soviet troops have reached Sarni, 25 miles inside the old Polish border.</p>
<p>Stockholm, November 11th, Central News Agency: For the past two days, the Ukrainian front has been experiencing blizzards and the temperature has dropped to minus six degrees, but the Soviet army, which is attempting to encircle the German army in the bend of the Dnieper River, and the German army, which is fighting bravely, are still engaged in bloody battles everywhere on a 500-kilometer-long battle line. In addition, in order to seize the Odessa-Krakow railway, the Ukrainian trunk line, to cut off the German rear, the Soviet army has been encircling Vinnitsa from the east, west, north, and south on the 10th and is also actively advancing towards the Bessarabian border between Zhmerinka and Proskurv. However, the German counterattack force is also increasing with the progress of the war. It has now formed a strong line of defense along the Bug River to prevent the Soviet army from advancing head-on. Another Soviet army unit is tailing the German army that withdrew from Kirovograd and advanced to Alekusevka north of the city and Ivanovga, 20 kilometers southwest of the city, on the 10th, intending to encircle the German army in Krivoy Rog. If the Soviet army's operation is successful, the situation will become serious. The German authorities have also recognized the seriousness of the situation and are implementing a shortening of the sticky battlefield and increasing reserve forces in order to defeat the Soviet army one by one. The war situation is now intensifying daily.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Violate Airspace: Sweden Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to London news: The Swedish envoy to London has lodged a protest with the British government regarding the British aircraft's intrusion into Swedish territory on the 6th of this month.</p>
<h3>Under British and American Inducement and Threat, Turkey Still Maintains Neutrality</h3>
<p>Istanbul, November 11th, Central News Agency: Since the convening of the Tehran Conference, the United Kingdom and the United States have used various means to pressure the Turkish government to try to make Turkey join the anti-Axis camp, but the country seems to be maintaining a cautious attitude and watching the progress of the war. Recently, a British military mission arrived in Istanbul and has begun to investigate military facilities and air force bases in Turkey. In addition, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Mediterranean, Wilson, also recently arrived in Ankara, and it is rumored that the British military envoy's arrival in Turkey is the vanguard of Britain's strong pressure on Turkey. Recently, the number of British engineers and workers in Ankara and Istanbul has increased sharply. These British people seem to be following. In addition, the Turkish ambassador to the United Kingdom, Airbe, recently returned to Ankara, planning to strengthen British-Turkish relations, which has led to widespread speculation that the Turkish government is about to be reorganized. However, judging from the current situation, Turkey has no intention of joining the war immediately. When we judge Turkey's attitude, we must pay attention to the Soviet offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front and the Soviet-Polish conflict. Now the Soviet army does not want to continue to launch an offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and the United Kingdom and the United States have taken a disdainful attitude towards the Soviet-Polish dispute. Therefore, it is expected that Turkey will still adhere to its policy of neutrality. It is said that the Turkish Prime Minister raised two difficult questions to the British and American representatives at the Cairo Conference as a prerequisite for Turkey's participation in the war: First, Turkey will increase the supply of military supplies, and second, it will drive out the German domination of the Aegean Sea and the Balkan Peninsula. The above conditions cannot be realized</p>
<h3>Report from America Suggests Agreement with Soviet Union to Maintain Permanent Peace</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch, the New York correspondent of the London Daily Mail reports that the United States may reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to avoid a third world war. Political figures are paying close attention to several speeches hosted by the State Department, and it is said that these speeches frequently touch upon this agreement. The draft is said to have been brought back by Hull from Moscow.</p>
<p>Subtle Relations Between Soviet Union and Poland</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch, the German Foreign Ministry stated that the Soviet Union immediately denied the news of the Soviet-Polish border dispute published by the diplomatic correspondent of the London "Observer." The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is not difficult to discern. The correspondent mentioned that the Soviet Union suggested demarcating the Soviet-Polish border according to the so-called "Curzon Line" of 1920, and compensating Poland's lost territory with German territory. The German Foreign Ministry believes that the "Observer's" diplomatic correspondent published this news, or had first obtained understanding or hints from British and American authorities. It is widely believed that Britain and the United States hope to discuss the Soviet-Polish border dispute, but the Soviet Union's denial shows that it does not want to discuss this issue. The German Foreign Ministry also mentioned the recent Swedish newspaper's surprise at the Soviet Union's unwillingness to take advantage of the benefits that democratic countries offer, stating that the opposite is true. The Soviet Union not only does not accommodate the anti-Axis powers but also disregards its anti-alliance. The Swedish newspaper's remarks show that the neutral public often has misconceptions about the true views of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Trial of Italian Treason Case Concluded, Ciano Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Verona, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch: The special court here has concluded the trial of Ciano and seventeen former members of the Fascist Grand Council who signed against Mussolini, which ultimately led to the July 25th Incident. Yesterday, Ciano and eighteen other members were sentenced to death, and one person was sentenced to thirty years of hard labor. Only Ciano personally appeared in court. Marshal Bono and five former members including Maricuei Baresi Kotehadi, etc., except for former Deputy Secretary of the Fascist Labor Union Qianeti who was sentenced to thirty years of hard labor, all other defendants were sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Decisive Battle: Germany's Defense Capabilities</h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun's Berlin-based special correspondent, Moriyama, recently traveled to neutral Spain and Portugal, spending about a month there before returning to Berlin at the end of the year. After seeing these two Iberian countries, he deeply felt that the great powers currently contending for national survival in Europe are the three major powers of Germany, England, and Russia. In today's Europe, so-called integrity, kindness, truth, and everything else are floating like rootless seaweed in the ever-changing tides. Whether it is the Atlantic Charter, the New Order Declaration, or hundreds of other propaganda and discussions, all are flowing in this turbulent current. In the end, they cannot break through the rather simple and timeless iron rule of "the strong dominate." In other words, the current stage of the European war is progressing much like a physical process: strong forces create environments, and environments dictate human thought. So, what kind of mechanical phenomena are the forces of Germany and the external pressures of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States creating on the current European battlefield? Here, we must frankly admit that since the valiant sacrifice of Field Marshal Paulus's Sixth Army in Stalingrad, Germany has faced an extremely difficult path in the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, and the Third Front in the air over the past year. Forces with more weapons and creating advantages occupy favorable positions. The European war is heading towards a world with these conditions.</p>
<p>When the homeland is in danger, attacking enemy battleships with human torpedoes has become common knowledge among the Japanese. Therefore, it is difficult to understand when seeing this "world of common sense" in Europe. But first, we must know that, in principle, there are no miracles on the European battlefield.</p>
<p>Reality Advances to the Victory of Common Sense</p>
<p>The European war is entering its sixth year with the new year, and it will soon enter a decisive phase. Both sides stand resolutely in a four-cornered formation, about to determine the final outcome. Moreover, they are not lined up in a four-cornered formation in the center of the wrestling ring; the positions of the enemy and us are constantly moving along the edge of the wrestling ring. The gasping sounds heard from there are extremely urgent. The blows suffered by the opponent are deep, and the tempering experienced by the allies is also profound. Faced with this reality, if one still cannot believe in "the victory of common sense" or "the victory of physical strength," then the European war is truly a tragedy.</p>
<p>But here, it must be pointed out that the heroic ideas often held by the Japanese harbor the danger of misjudging the future of the European war. Germany's idea of placing the origins of the new European order on military strength was correct. Germany always believed that it must use force to defeat the enemy and overwhelm the enemy. Hundreds of propagandas and statements are no match for a single small military victory. Looking out at the enemy situation from the neutral countries of Iberia, recalling Germany, and then returning to the bombed-out Berlin, the reporter felt this point most strongly.</p>
<p>Germany's Strength as Seen in Defensive Capabilities</p>
<p>So, where is the strength of Germany, which made France surrender in six weeks, now at work? This strength cannot be seen in the form of active offensive power, but we find this strength in the current defensive capabilities. On the vast Eastern Front, desperately stopping the fierce pressure of the superior Soviet army, resolutely responding to the terrifying bombing piercing the heart of Berlin, this strength can be said to be stronger than the German strength that subdued France in six weeks in a certain sense. We see a different form of German strength than three years ago. In other words, it is "tenacity." It is not a blitzkrieg racing through the battlefield; the enemy and us are struggling on the edge of the wrestling ring. The German tenacity displayed there amazes us, and the most shocked are probably the enemies themselves. In the previous war, the famine war of food blockade caused the German people to collapse from within. This time, the enemy's strategy is to replace food blockade with terror bombing, attempting the same effect.</p>
<p>In 1943, German military communiqués stated that 54 cities, large and small, suffered the tragedy of terror bombing, with Berlin being the worst. It was subjected to 13 major air raids, dropping a total of tens of thousands of tons of bombs. As a result, a part of Berlin has been completely destroyed. On the bustling streets of Berlin, one sees the same scene as Zhabei and Yangshupu, which were turned into scorched earth after dozens of days of fierce fighting. Every citizen of Berlin keenly feels the impression of fighting on the front line. Seven million citizens in Hamburg and small cities in the Rhine region have moved to other safer places within Germany. The tragedy of hundreds of thousands of families being destroyed overnight, leaving them disheveled and fleeing in panic, would have turned into rebellion or riots in peacetime.</p>
<p>Attempt to Discourage Fighting Spirit Fails</p>
<p>The police force and the organization for maintaining order have been established, ensuring the safe evacuation of the elderly, women, and children. Emergency relief facilities such as food and lodging are fully equipped. Every German citizen maintains an extremely strong morale under wartime conditions. The same is true in Hamburg. If one of the goals of the enemy's terror bombing is to discourage the morale of the German people, it will not be achieved. In 1940, Germany also bombed London, believing that it could make the British abandon their will to fight. However, that was a delusion, and now the British and American air forces are repeating the same mistake. At the current stage, if one wants to draw a conclusion about bombing, it is possible to make the people of small countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium lose their will to fight. However, it is impossible to make the people of large countries such as England and Germany abandon their will to fight solely through bombing. In some cases, it creates the opposite effect, making the opponent's will to fight even stronger. Although it seems like a detour, bombing should be concentrated on destroying the enemy's military facilities or military industrial capacity.

<p>Seventieth Birthday Celebrations Used for Aid to Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Wang Zhenchuan also donated 80,000 yuan for aid to education. As this month's 10th marks the seventieth birthdays of Dr. Wang's respected father and mother, relatives and friends insisted on celebrating their longevity. However, Dr. Wang's parents did not allow any extravagance at this time. To fulfill the good intentions of relatives and friends, they allocated 340,000 yuan for charitable deeds and aid to poor students. In addition to donating 20,000 yuan to the Civilian Sanatorium, 30,000 yuan to the Poor Children's Handicraft Training Institute, 10,000 yuan to the China Ziyou Association, 10,000 yuan to the Xin Puyu Hall, 10,000 yuan to the Charity Association, 10,000 yuan to the Renci Charity Association, 10,000 yuan to the School for the Deaf and Dumb, 10,000 yuan to the Pushan Villa, 10,000 yuan to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, 20,000 yuan to the China Education Morality Association, and 30,000 yuan to the Municipal Government's winter relief efforts, he also donated 80,000 yuan to this newspaper's scholarship fund through the introduction of Mr. Bao Tianxiao, as well as 10,000 yuan to the Xinwen Bao Student Loan Fund and other aid funds. Their longevity and service to the world are deeply admired.</p>
<p>All Sectors Responding Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The readers of this newspaper are enthusiastically responding to the scholarship fund, donating generously, which is deeply appreciated. We received a letter from Lai Youji yesterday, stating that the scholarship fund organized by this newspaper not only benefits the poor but also cultivates talents for the country. They have gathered a few friends to contribute 10,000 yuan in national currency to express their support. The students of all grades of the Zhongxi No. 1 Primary School extracted 2,000 yuan in national currency from the charity donations raised during Christmas as the scholarship fund for this newspaper to express the mutual assistance of the children. Mr. Wang Huichen saw the newspaper's call for aid to education and expressed deep sympathy. He specifically saved his New Year's bonus, totaling 500 yuan in national currency, for aid to education. At the same time, he hopes that other readers will also actively participate.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donations Received</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received 200,000 yuan from Mr. Sheng Wenyi, 80,000 yuan from Dr. Wang Zhenchuan (transferred from the birthday celebrations of his parents), 10,000 yuan from Lai Youji (designated for a student applying from Fuxin Women's School), 3,000 yuan from Lu Jinglin (transferred from banquet expenses), 3,000 yuan from Heng An Ji, 2,000 yuan from students of all grades of Zhongxi No. 1 Primary School, 1,500 yuan from an anonymous donor, 1,000 yuan from Pei Yunqing, 1,163 yuan from students of Zhaofeng Primary School, 900 yuan from Yin Ji, 600 yuan from Zhi Ji, 600 yuan jointly from Yu Shigui and Zhao Jiabin, 500 yuan from Wang Huichen (transferred from New Year's expenses), 400 yuan from Lu Kang, 300 yuan jointly from the 376th and 2617th Hua police of the First Police Bureau, 150 yuan from high-grade students of Zhao Girls' Primary School, 100 yuan each from Zhu Gensheng, Mao Junheng, Cai Yinsheng, and other sympathetic donors, 57 yuan from Xi Da Jun, and 12 yuan from Ye An Ting, totaling 305,682 yuan in savings bonds.

<h3>Tenth Round of Household Sugar to Be Issued on the 15th</h3>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Paying Respect to All Those Who Generously Donate to the Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>The application forms for the sixth round of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund were distributed over three days from the 8th to the 10th. The crowding situation exceeded expectations, with over 16,000 forms issued to new and returning students. Our hope is that all those who meet the standards can receive assistance. However, the problem lies in whether the amount of the scholarship fund is sufficient. The original plan was for 3 million yuan, which is not enough for distribution. Therefore, we have been calling on readers to donate generously for days.</p>
<p>As expected, it has aroused the noble sympathy of people from all walks of life. Yesterday, we were honored to receive 200,000 yuan from Mr. Sheng Wenyi and his wife and son. For the previous scholarship fund, Mr. Sheng personally and through fundraising from relatives and friends donated as much as 170,000 yuan. Such enthusiasm is truly worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhenchuan also donated 80,000 yuan yesterday. He transferred 340,000 yuan, which were the birthday gifts from relatives and friends for the seventieth birthdays of his parents, to be used for charitable deeds. This newspaper's scholarship fund received 80,000 yuan, which has a profound meaning and is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>In addition, people from all walks of life responded enthusiastically, and we received over 300,000 yuan throughout the day, which makes us feel extremely excited. However, we are still far from the goal. We are preparing to launch a campaign to request donations from leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors. We firmly believe that the enthusiasm of people in the industrial and commercial sectors will not lag behind others and will definitely be able to contribute to the success.</p>

<h3>Dedication Plane Cup Soccer Match: China Defeats Italian League 3-2, Charity Auction of Soccer Ball Nets 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Dedication Plane Cup Charity Soccer Match, sponsored by the Municipal Public Dedication Plane Movement Committee, kicked off at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. China faced off against the Italian League. Mayor Chen personally kicked off the game, and Minister Ding presided over the auction of soccer balls and the awarding of prizes. The charity sale began, and the bidding was extremely enthusiastic. In the end, Liuhe She broke the highest record for the auction of Italian soccer balls. The Chinese team relied on good luck to defeat the Italian League 3-2, and team captain Li Ning took home the trophy.</p>
<p>Relationship with Luck</p>
<p>Although the Italian League suffered a crushing defeat yesterday, their spirit and perseverance far surpassed China's. Due to extremely bad luck, they lost the game. In terms of individual skills, the Italian League's defender, Mai Gezi, acted on his own, giving the impression of a group without a leader. The cooperative understanding of the center-back line was lacking. The rear defenders, Qi Xiang and Li Ning, had different playing styles, making cooperation impossible. In the second half, Qi Xiang and Zhang Lingen switched positions, and the situation gradually improved.</p>
<p>Match Process</p>
<p>At the beginning of the match, the Italian League's offensive was strong, with great momentum. After eight minutes, Di Pan Na stood on his own, hooking the ball in mid-air. Liu Xianhan was caught off guard, and China conceded the first goal. Four minutes later, the Chinese team launched a full-scale offensive. Song Lingsheng stood in the way, intercepted the ball, and passed it to Xu Wenkui. The ball crossed the final defensive line, and Li [Blank] scored with a header. The angle was precise, and McNitti risked his life to save it, but it was too late. The score was tied. Ten minutes later, Wu Qi Xiang accidentally scored an own goal, and Liu Xian Han was too careless and should bear half the responsibility. As things changed, Xu Wenkui steadily secured the victory. Each team scored two goals in the first half, resulting in a tie. After switching sides, both teams went all out. The game went from relaxed to tense. [Blank] Yongfu and Sun Jinshun sold their youth well, but they failed to contribute. Before long, Italian League's Luo Xulai committed a foul in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick, which Sun Jinshun kicked in to make it 3-2, coming from behind. When time was up, China defeated the Italian League 3-2.</p>

<h3>Citizen Welfare Association Requests Strict Supervision of Maritime Administration to Avoid Repeating the Huatai Ferry Disaster</h3>
<p>The Municipal Citizen Welfare Association, in view of the tragic disaster of the sinking of the Huatai ferry due to the lax supervision of the Maritime Administration, to avoid repeating the same mistake, specifically requested the Ministries of Transportation and Finance to strictly order the relevant agencies to strictly enforce the regulations. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the Huatai Ferry Disaster, which was due to the lax supervision of the Maritime Administration, we earnestly request that the Customs be strictly ordered to instruct the Maritime Administration to strictly enforce the regulations to prevent future tragedies: We have learned that the Huatai ferry of the Shanghai China Shipping Company suffered an accident in the Xin'gang River area at 7:30 PM on December 9th of last year. Crew members and passengers were killed by drowning, with over 700 people dead, making it an unprecedented catastrophe in the shipping industry in recent years. Regarding the cause of the sinking, the company blamed it on passengers not maintaining order and swarming onto the ship before the passengers inside disembarked. As a result, both disembarking and embarking passengers gathered on one side of the ship, causing the ship to tilt and flood rapidly, making it impossible to stop. According to the accounts of surviving passengers, most of the passengers were porters carrying goods piled up on the deck. The crew members would not allow them to enter the cabin until they had negotiated terms and received fees. Therefore, the top was heavy and the bottom was light, causing the ship to tilt and capsize. The Maritime Administration believes that the main reason for the ship's capsizing was that the load exceeded the prescribed limit by more than double. The crew members did not comply with the regulations and were not inspected, and there were also shortcomings in driving management. Combining the talks from the three parties and comparing them, the cause of this accident should be attributed to each party's responsibility. However, the disorder and crowding of passengers, as well as the stacking of goods on the deck, were due to the crew members' lack of guidance, who only knew how to be greedy and exploit passengers, not knowing that the crew members have the obligation to serve travelers. This cannot be entirely blamed on the passengers. The Dongchang ferry, a municipal ferry barge, carrying 402 passengers, piled the wood it was carrying on the top of the boat, creating a top-heavy situation. When the boat turned around, there happened to be wind and waves, causing it to capsize. Passengers fell into the Huangpu River, the same as the Huatai ferry disaster. Not long after this case occurred, the company's Anhe ferry arrived at Xin'gang at 2:00 PM on December 14th. Thirty or forty sampan boatmen climbed aboard, causing the ship to tilt and presenting a dangerous situation. Fortunately, a neighboring boat rescued them, and nothing happened. Based on this, the disaster of capsizing can happen at any time. How can we not learn from the pain and plan for the future? Members of this association, in view of this tragic case, propose the following plans to be warned by previous occurrences: We specifically request that your Ministry strictly order the Jianghai Customs to instruct the Maritime Administration to strictly enforce the regulations regarding the technical inspection of crew members, the prohibition of exceeding the prescribed load limit, and how to smoothly facilitate the transportation of materials in various places, to avoid small merchants risking their lives for profit, traveling on the river at night. The company should be ordered to build docks or build platform boats in convenient locations to ensure the safety of travelers embarking and disembarking. Instead of trying to fix things after they happen, it is better to put more effort into the people, so that the people can benefit more. The laws of the country must not be empty words, and major tragedies must not recur in society. This is what the members of this association hope for. As for the aftermath of the Huatai disaster, we should promptly handle it strictly. The members of this association humbly request that the Ministry review and instruct us on the implementation. Sincerely submitted to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Economic Community's Comments</p>
<h3>General Mobilization of Production</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we mentioned that the National Government's participation in the war has entered its second year, and the Chairman has declared that this year's focus should be on the production increase movement. Now, we would like to add our supportive words to the broadcast speech given the day before yesterday by Mr. Tajiri, the Japanese Minister to our allied nation, on the "Strengthening Production Movement."</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri believes that this is not a time for empty talk. All personnel in various industries should unite and exert their full strength to study and enhance production. We are very pleased to feel that the sentence we quoted yesterday, "Governing is not about talking much, but about acting vigorously," is exactly the same as what Minister Tajiri said. In short, empty talk about increasing production is a thing of the past. From now on, it is a period of general mobilization of production. Whether one was previously engaged in production or not, everyone must now gather under the banner of the production increase movement and dedicate themselves as industrial warriors on the production line. As Minister Tajiri said, "No one should be allowed to fall behind." Only then can it be called a general mobilization of production.</p>
<p>The most important condition after the general mobilization of production is the active improvement of production methods. The ways to achieve this are: In terms of management, all factories must strive for scientific management in the future, whether it be in personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, or operations. They must strive for the most efficient operation under the two conditions of reducing consumption and increasing efficiency. In terms of work, the managers, factory directors, and workers of all factories must work hard within their respective positions and not be disturbed by any thoughts or activities outside their positions. Managers should focus on production planning, factory directors should focus on production management, and workers should focus on the use of production machinery and equipment. Only then can the production increase movement achieve the most satisfactory results and contribute to the circle of industrial co-prosperity!</p>

<h3>Improving Railway Transportation: A Stopgap Measure</h3>
<p>— Wang Weiying</p>
<p>The recent election of Zheng Hongnian, a leader in the transportation industry, as the president of the China Central Railway Company, with the intention of improving the long-chaotic railway transportation and reducing the suffering of travelers, is indeed a wise move by the authorities.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the fundamental problem of the current transportation situation lies in the large-scale activities of individual peddlers. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine, eliminating the peddlers would solve the root cause. However, this involves politics, so let's put it aside for now.</p>
<p>As for stopgap measures, there are two main ideas: (A) Absolutely prohibit passengers from carrying luggage. Only single travelers without personal belongings are allowed to board. If they entrust a travel agency to transport their goods, they will not be able to obtain huge profits, and the procedures will be more time-consuming, which they will not be willing to do. It is easier for the controlling authorities to inspect, and it is not inconvenient for ordinary passengers. (B) In addition to the date, the train number should be added to the ticket, and regardless of first, second, third, or fourth class, seats should be assigned to each person. Or, for third and fourth class tickets, which are more numerous, the car number can be printed in addition. In this way, each ticket guarantees a seat, which will definitely reduce the degree of disorder.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Ambition (2)</p>
<p>When the autumn semester started, Masato's painstaking sunbathing paid off and he received praise from Major Kikuchi. At the same time, he was also ridiculed by his classmates.</p>
<p>"Look! The apple has turned black, what a roasted apple."</p>
<p>At that time, roasted apples were popular in coffee shops on the street.</p>
<p>"Hum..." Masato smiled indifferently. This was because he didn't even know what a roasted apple was. He never bought things outside. This was mainly because he didn't have much money in his pocket, and especially because his mother didn't like that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new semester, Masato was elected as the deputy group leader. Although his music scores were not good, his mathematics and English scores were outstanding. So that's why he got this result.</p>
<p>"That's great..." His mother was also very happy and bought group snacks called "Harukoma" to celebrate.</p>
<p>Mother - is there anyone better than a mother in the world? Masato's love for his mother has become even more profound recently. Now he understands the feeling of his mother fighting for her children and family at all costs. He also understood why his mother wore ragged clothes herself, while making sure that Taro and Masato wore neat clothes. If his father was still alive, he would never understand his mother's heart so deeply--</p>
<p>"Mom's rice, let me serve you!" One morning, when the family gathered for breakfast, Masato said this, dragging the rice bucket to his side.</p>
<p>"Boys don't need to do such things." His mother gently rebuked him. In fact, there were many maids such as Matsueda, Kayo, and Akigiku.</p>
<p>Masato lost face and blushed.</p>
<p>"Then, I'll just serve one bowl..." Having said that, his mother couldn't refuse, and handed him the rice bowl. Masato seemed to be showing his respect by filling the bowl to the brim.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is really too much..." His mother didn't know how to take it, but a smile appeared on her long face.</p>
<p>From then on, Masato never complained about the dishes in his lunch box. Even if there were only a few pieces of salted radish, he never complained. When he finished eating, it was as clean as if it had been washed, without leaving a single grain of rice. That was because he noticed that it would save his sisters trouble when cleaning up. Sometimes he squatted by the well to wash his own things. His technique was also quite skilled. All in all, Masato was a very admirable young man. But his admirable qualities did not win his mother's favor.</p>
<p>(It would be better if that kind of child died quickly...)</p>

<h3>A Kind of Food Substitute</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fusheng</p>
<p>Qingsong Convenient Pills are a kind of food substitute. The method of making them is as follows: Ingredients: One dou of pine needle powder, three sheng of glutinous rice, two sheng of red dates. Manufacturing process: Wash pine needles with water regardless of quantity, spread them out in the shade to dry slightly, pound them into a paste in a stone mortar, then spread them out in the shade or dry them in the sun, then grind them into powder and sift them for use. Separately, use three sheng of glutinous rice and two sheng of red dates. The red dates must be soaked overnight, cooked until soft, peeled, pitted, and cooked into a thick porridge. Add one dou of pine needle powder and cook together, stirring evenly to make pills or cakes. Dry them in the sun and store them. Take two liang daily, served with thin porridge or boiled water. One will not feel hungry all day and can work. One dose can feed one person for three months. Long-term users may have bowel movements every few days, but their health is not affected.</p>
