<h3>抑止股票投機</h3>
<p>「目前股票投機狂的普遍現象，都是一般「實業公司」所造成的。聰明的人們，雙眼獨具，打起一實業公司」的招牌，董監事羣中，排列着「實業家」的大名，以令人咋舌的資本額炫耀大衆，大吹大擂，捏造藏餘的消息，利用大衆不願坐視握有的金錢價値逐漸消失，羣趨買賣股票，奔走於投機市場的心理，結果，把民衆的血汗金錢，榨取而去。」</p>
<p>「現在大部分「實業公司」，其股票與實際，都有極大出入，且在本質上，都以投機操縱爲唯一的營業。而一班公司，眼看着股票投機的黃金時代，逐各自利用自己的股票，走向「實業公司」的道路。例如電影製片塲，食品公司，地產公司等</p>
<p>上面引述的，是昨天本報的星期評論中，吉田東祐先生所說的話，也可以說我們所想說的話，同時，也是目前嚴重的戰時經濟病態，可拍的戰時自殺現象。</p>
<p>自從去年十月證劵交易所復業，開拍股票以來，數月間逐漸演成目前股票投機瘋狂的混亂局面，决非始料所及的。證交復業開拍股票的目的，當然在活潑金融，助長工商業繁榮，促進生產增加。而目前的結果適得其反，徒然造成投機心理的瘋狂。為行麼正當的方法，良好的制度，經過國人引用以後，就會變成投機工具呢？橘踰淮北而變成枳，言之實堪痛心。而吉田先生為日本人士，從他口中道出我們的缺點，織悉無遺，尤足使稍有人心者感到惶悚。</p>
<p>近數月來，各業公司紛紛創立，名目繁多，共中極少數經營正當，大部份雖然以經營某種工商事業作標榜，而其實際內容，不過闢幾間辦公室，安置幾只寫字樓而已。在登報招股，股款尙未收齊而股票黑市巴超過票面，這公司舉行創立會後並不從事業上着想，急急設法股票上市，上市後復盡力拉抬，使股票市價超過票面相當價值以後，藉口資產增值，辦理增資，一轉手間，獲利數倍。且半官投機分子與商人投機分子之心理，莫不以公司資本越大越好，則獲利愈大；股票票面越小越好，則吸引力愈普遍；公司設立越多越好，則賺錢方面更多·於是國民經濟遂亦愈受剝削而萎頹。猶有進者，創立新公司後，將該公司所收股款再創立另一公司，層層相因，猶諸過去囤積者，以囤貨押款，再囤貨，再押款，押款愈多，囤貨愈多，廉錢亦愈多，迨一旦囤貨被收買，無法彌補黑市差價，遂以自殺或破產了之。結果，若輩自殺破產絕不足惜，而戰時國民經濟被其擾亂，貨蟞價值愈擾愈落，物價愈漲，大衆生活愈苦，此罪實不可恕·我們敢說，過去的操縱囤積者，就是現在的操縱股票者，若輩是先天的投機份子，隨時隨地施展投機技倆，惟利是圖，不顧戰時大局。如果政治沒有懲治大量，社會沒有制裁力量，則投機猖獗一天，社會就混亂一天，民生就痛苦一天。</p>
<p>股票投機，在目前已是很嚴重的戰時經濟病態，政府當局自然不能熟視無賭，我們貢獻意見數點：</p>
<p>按交易所監理委員會對於上市股票之審查原則中第二項規定：「公司成立營業一年以上者」。叉監理委員會組織規則第二項:「各種有價證券，須得監委會之許可始得上塲交易。」是則最近有二十七家股票未經該會審查即行上市，即為非法，而交易所當局以未經審查核准之股票上市開拍，究竟有何根據，豈能諉為不知審查規則，實有助長投機之可能，該所當局應受相當懲處。現在監委會令此二十七家股票暫停交易，自極正當，惟審查時應嚴格遵照「審查原則」之規定，公司營業未及一年以上者，更絕對不許股票上市。</p>
<p>本年一月二十日中央社消息，實業部鑒於各地游資競事投機，刺激物價，擾亂金融，而各種經營地產買賣及投資企業等公司，亦多趨向於投機交易，為防止蔓延起見，定自一月二十一曹起，一律停止公司新設，並望商民投資於增產事業，切勿經營投機性質之公司，致遭報失。實業部此種限制，確極賢明，但一方面雖限制設立，而一方面仍粉紛創立，所以，必須嚴格執行，絕無例外。如未級准許擅自設立，即應勒令停業並加懲罰。對於公司增資，亦應嚴格審核，毌被濫用。</p>
<p>官商分野，是我們素所主張的。而公務員不得兼營商業，也為政府明令規定的。不過，不明法紀的官吏，自己雖不出面，却利用親戚故舊出面經營，假藉特殊便利，暢所欲為。於是投機商人益發推波助瀾，狐假虎威。我們盼望政府當局以本公無私的精神，加以澈查，務使官商不分的夾層份子無所施其伎倆，並予投機商人以當頭棒喝。例如半官性質的公司，利用宣傳機關的鼓吹，擠在投機羣中竭力拉抬，使股票狂漲，坐獲巨利，引起一般投機商入眼紅，投機氣燄益烈，希望政府當局先從此類半官公司開始整飭。</p>
<p>現在交易所上市的股要，雖經核准，但為防止投機，並提倡生產事業，另行嚴定標準，重加審核，凡非直接生產性之工商業股票，一律不准上市。雖掛生產事業招牌，而內容無實際生產設備或雖有設備而不從事生產之股票，同樣不准上市。不准上市之股票，而私相授受暗盤交易，尤應嚴厲禁止。</p>
<p>總之，現在已屆大東亞戰爭決戰階段，參戰國家自應出共生死力量協同爭取勝利，中國自不能處身例外。而上海為後方經濟重地，不但未能縱其戰時經濟之貢獻，而今日熱中於股票投機的個人發財狂，政府當局從速抑止，自為刻不容緩而責無旁貸之舉。</p>
<h3>印緬邊境顯威力日機猛襲敵陣地　布其頓發生空戰予敵重創</h3>
<p>仰光五日中央社電　英印軍於去春反攻緬甸，在阿東勒坎慘敗以來·迄今十月仍實傳反攻緬甸，但為日軍所阻，無法發動。最近緬印邊境英印軍已完成反攻準備，迭次在孟多。布其頓正面，以小部兵力出擊，欲試探日軍之虛實，一方面不斷將兵力集結於第一錢後方·日陸軍機隊曾於四日利用晴朗天氣。大舉飛往布其頓方面，猛炸企圖義動之敵軍，並與敵機交戰，予以重創。綠日陸軍機隊於四日上午轟炸布其頓戰綫時，適與敵噴火式戰門機及B38型八架敵機編隊相遇。敵機隊伍混亂企圖遁走，日機立即追擊，擊落其二架後·協力日軍地上部隊猛炸市其頓前面敵陣地。此時敵軍第一綫適由後方潔到高射砲隊高射機關砲隊卡軍隊及步兵部隊，正為日機轟炸之確好目標。敵軍陣地）經日機反覆轟炸，常即起火，火燄冲天。受創極重。日機於完成任務後·全部安返原防。</p>

<h3>慈善足球盛况空前中華勝西聯　三比零西聯球運奇劣</h3>
<p>上海足球聯合會主辦之慈善足球賽，於昨晨在逸崗舉行，情况熱烈。球賽至十時五十分開始，首由滬聯總幹事周家騏在播音機中報吿義賽舉辦目的，繼由區公署樂隊奏樂，丁部長親臨開球。裁判吳守衡銀笛聲起，西聯即行進攻，鮑休脫如出柙之虎，猛撲中華之門，幸吿野逸。中華乘勢來犯，費靑華邊睡直入、盤至禁區，舉足叩門，買幼良趕上，將球碰至左角，時麥尼蒂方以全力注意右方。遂被，韓龍　拍開二皮。再立殊勳。前半時結束，三比〇中華佔優。休息時拍賣離義球，由袁履登林康侯及孫鳴岐等主持，結果六合社以二十一萬元成交，打破義球售價最高紀錄。易門再戰，西聯陣容頗有調整，攻勢因之轉盛。中華門前，險象環生，鮑休脫二度力射，均被劉顯漢挽救，未爲所算。麥其當在近門處一脚，来勢極盟，又被顯漢臥第按住，全塲觀衆，均報以熱烈掌聲，是時球恒在中華門前盤旋，西聯屢攻不入。二十三分鏟時，張林根在禁區犯規，被判十二碼球，由勞勃司托夫操刀，因求勝心切，適中劉顯漢懷中，竟未能打破鴨蛋，殊為不幸。西聯此後漸露疲態，中華則以勝算在握，不為已甚，戰局遂呈鬆懈。迨鳴金收軍，中華以三比〇全勝。</p>

<h3>速籌物價對策</h3>
<p>物價的騰貴，依然漲無止境，和平區大部分人民，被威脅而在生活的狂濤中掙扎，知識階級，薪俸階級，工資勞働者，農民，誰也不能免於例外。因物價的昻騰，從中獲得鉅利而暴富者，乃不足民衆百分之一的投機份子。因此種投機分子的漁利，致民生問題日處危殆。要在這基礎上建立起中國的戰時經濟，顯然是一件困難的事。戰事經濟的基本前提，應抑止物價的昻騰，使國民的所得合理化，</p>
<p>知識階級，勤勞生活者，是參戰中國的中堅份子。這中堅份子而終日疲命於柴米油鹽，如何再有餘暇從事別的工作，中國如何能强大，再看中國的現實情形，守正義節操而安本分者，均苦於生活，而不義犯法者，概得富貴，此種情形，荀長此繼續。中國的道義能不墜地？這不是簡單的物價問題。所以澈底的徹治投機份子，取締投機行為，實是最有效的物價對策，且在保持參戰中國的道義上，亦是絕對必要的。</p>
<p>然而取締投機行為，不能說就是物價問題的解决。尙有更根本的對策，例如促進上海與內地的物資交流，斷絕中間層的榨取，收買與配給的合理化能率化。有計劃的放出銀行資金，收縮投機費金等，可立即實現的方策，如一一實施，均可有助於物價問題的解决。</p>
<p>誰也知道物價問題日趨嚴重。無諭從戰時經濟建設　看，從國民心理建設上看，是絕對不能袖手旁觀的。我們敢再要求國府，下最大的决心，迅即着手有效的物價封策。（翔譯自二月二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>貨物源源來滬供應物品激增　各業嚴格監督同業買賣</h3>
<p>本市各當局為謀增厚物贅存底，藉以穩定物價起見，對於蘇浙皖鄂粵等地貨物曁土產原料。經積極設法疏通，頗收著效。記者昨向工商界探悉。現上述各地之貨物運滬者，絡繹於途，大多屬於雜權，及工業上所需之原料，裨益本市工商業之拓展殊屬不尠，預料本市各種物品供應籌碼，將見激增。</p>
<p>監督同業買賣</p>
<p>昨悉各主要商品同業公會，成爲協助當局復蘇工商業及抑平物價起見，已次第採取下列各項步驟。計：　遵照中央意旨，發起組設各該業同業公會。　訂定同業買賣業規，飭各會員同業一體遵仃。　籌立評價委員會，按期評訂標池限似。　負責配給事宜，藉克杜絕黑市。因取締非法交易，規定概以現貨買賣為限。</p>
<p>禁止流動交易</p>
<p>查自當局命令停止各業市場買賣後，一般投機商人及掮客，不無遭受嚴重威脅，若輩在當局嚴格監視之下，平日行動深感約束，惟其居心叵測，竟敢流動交易，在各清淨馬路上非法經營，茲悉，關係當局對彼輩奸商，决予嚴厲之制裁，一經查獲此項交易，即將其拘獲，起訴法院，依法厭究，藉儆效尤，而安商市，同時希望市民協助檢舉·</p>
<h3>銀錢業　提高貸款率</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊為防止利用行莊資金從事投機囤積起見實施緊縮放款後，决定對一切新放款於其用　經認為足以助長投機囤積者，一概拒絕，如係本業確有正當需要者，得分別酌予貸放，並視其生產狀况為標準。頃聞各行莊除提高存款利率，吸收社會游費外，對於任何放歉包括信用抵押守，其利息决亦提高三分以上，並聞錢業每月公佈之存欠息行市，其欠息一項將提至四十兀。即月息為四分，得此事正在嚴密考慮之中。</p>

<h3>南太平洋前綫巡禮</h3>
<p>從日本本部某地飛出的海軍〇〇機，在太平洋上向南高翔，一路朝第一綫的某根據地飛去。我和許多海軍少年飛行兵一同搭乘着飛機。他們看上去都不過二十歲光景。向他們一打聽，其中竟有年紀祇有十七歲的兵。他們的意氣着實可佩，都以為這次始得實殘多年的夙望，從此可以挺身最前錢，和不共戴天的美兵相會。但是他們彼此談論的話語，毋庸久聆，即可知道是天眞無邪的，足以證明他們全是孩子。這樣的一軍孩子們，果能完成為戰果最大要素的重大工作嗎？我不禁感到有些不安。但不久我發覺自己犯了很大的錯誤。</p>
<p>少年飛行兵</p>
<p>少年飛行兵除攙帶裝貯官家發給的被服的白帆布袋以外，各有一雙置放日用品的提包。它和預定巡禮戰綫數十天的我所帶的行李比較起來，眞是小得可憐，所以我不覺脫口問他們這樣是否足敷應甩，於是一個少年飛行兵答道：「祇要帶兩個月光景的東西就够了，因為以後是戰死了！「聽到這樣的回答，使我不得不肅然起敬，不勝感動！</p>
<p>提包以外，各個少年飛行兵照例似地攙着一本照相溥。我曾問好幾個兵要來看了一看。裹面有父母的肖像，有各人幼時的照片，以及運動會和修學旅行等國民學校時代所拍的像片，也有在鄉村靑年學校時獲得優勝旗的記念照，最後，還有出征之日在祖宗面前所攝的照片。這些照片中，有幾張確然褪了色或沾上手垢，但都貼得很整齊。他們在到達目的地以前，坐在飛機上一遍又一遍地翻閱着，並且互相交換，津津有味地閱覽。他們大約感到在光榮的戰死之日來臨以前，要從這一本照相簿中得到雙親的勉勵，兒時友伴的聲援，和祖宗的保佑而戰吧。</p>
<p>未幾，我們所乘的飛機抵達接近最前綫的一個根據地，我於是和這批少年飛行兵告別，在飛行塲的一邊，整齊地排列着若干架新飛機，它們是在等待和我一同到達此地的少年飛行兵的。當我在飛行塲的一隅等待搭載我的飛機時，少年飛行兵不久就一換上飛行服，各登指定的飛機。這時，他們巳不是剛才和我說話的孩子了。他們的眼中，他們的臉上，都流溢着殺敵致果的决意，看上去眞是可恃可賴。够崇高的精神哪！現在的戰事，乃是敵方的量和我方的質對抗，我們能够不斷地壓倒敵人，擊破敵人，基礎便在於這種崇高的情神。</p>
<h3>一邊作戰一邊耕種</h3>
<p>住於南方戰區各烏嶼上的原住民，並不懂得耕種土地以得收穫的方法。長久佔有此處的敵人，其食　也仰給於本國及其他殖民地，自已旣不耕種，對於原住民也不加以指敎。此外還有一個原因，便是在這人口稀薄，天然食糧豐富的區域，實在不需要耕種。可是，今日，若千萬的日軍是進駐此地了，而且隨着戰况的劇烈，渡過廣闊的大洋而送往前錢的物資，其運輸逐漸不易。糧秣旣不能得之於瞰地，又不能取之於友方。這就是所羅門。新幾內亞，俾斯麥羣島方面的現狀，枵腹而戰，畢竟不是事體。這個困難的課題如何解决呢？因此，日軍第一綫的將十毅然親自握起了耒耜。</p>
<p>土地並不是不宜耕種，日光雨量也不是不充沛。耕過之後，種下從祖國帶來的種子，毛豆，豌豆·甘·茹子·胡瓜·白菜一類的東西都茁起芽來，並因氣溫關係，成長很速，有些在播種後三星期內就可收獲了。可是開拓這種農耕地的辛苦却非尋常可比。</p>
<p>從開懇到耕作，看到將士們孜孜工作狀況，正如觀到他們和敵兵繳獲的雜姿一樣，使我們感到不可名狀的敬佩。這兩種情形，可說都是出於磅礴日軍將士全身的不折不撓的精神。這種堅强德精神，一方面排除一切困難，擊破强敵，一方面巧妙地克服了强暴的自然力。這個樣子種成的蔬菜，我也吃過了好幾次。每逢將筷子伸入這種菜碗時，總禁不住熱淚滿眶，感激不巳。</p>
<h3>精神戰勝物質</h3>
<p>陣中，新出的口號很多。其中有不少是從實戰的經驗生出來的，雖然誰也不曾喊出口，但却是将士間廣泛地遵行的珍貴訓條，例如「隱疾非病」就是其中之一。稍稍慣於南方第一綫生活的將土，對於隱疾已不覺其苦了。據　方的發表，他們的前綫士兵中患隱疾者陸軍爲三％，海軍爲二％；可是，這和發表戰訊一樣，是美國之流的不正確的報這，賣際上富三倍或五倍於這種百分率。這種患者，迅速退日前綫，到後方去着意調養的事情，在我們的陣中是沒有的。一則因爲我們有豐富的金鑼納霜，不許。有一個士兵曾經吿一訴我說：「運這次在內已是第五次患瘧疾了。「瘧疾患者不從前綫退下來，發着四十度的熟而帶病作戰的實例，並不是稀少的珍聞。在蘇達地方，海軍陸戰隊的某二等兵曹，在守望時忽然至起很利害的疟疾，同時，監視所和隊本都的電話綫又被敵彈切斷，因此，這個患瘾疾的二等兵曹。每日須步行四公甩，向隊本部報吿。</p>
<p>防空陣地上，一個擔任射擊的下十官說：「正在討擊敵機的機關槍和高射砲，决不會中到敵彈。因爲此方的精神壓倒了敵機的射手。精神如果失敗，那就會被人幹掉了。」這是從長久的實戰經騐所產生的話語吧。决心不為敵彈命中的前綫將士的精神，着實可以　暵。這　的精神。可說是無敵的，然而近代戰的特質，雖有這種精神，也不是憑此就一可以使敵人　伏的。說明白一點，便是在精神之外，還需要充足的軍火。鐵量的多寡在戰果的决定上是有很大的意義的。回顧倫特巴，蒙達等的悲痛戰况吧。日軍不隊在各次戰鬥中、並未失敗，然而不拘如此，仍不得不暫時放羣所佔的位置，其理由所在，要之，是由於鐵最的不足。</p>
<p>在激戰中的蒙達的戰塲上，某司令官說：「戰爭是音　哪！一這句話確能巧妙地表現近代戰的特質·飛機的隆隆聲，戰事的軋軋聲，槍砲及炸彈的吼聲，魚雷的爆發聲，向對方陣地潘送的擴音機的聲音，　許多音響　雜地交作的地方，便是近代戰的戰塲。而這些音響的音源，則可分爲敵我雙方。比較雙方陣地所發音響的強烈多少，便可測知那一方面的戰事有利。</p>
<p>今日，捷報仍頻頻從戰綫傳來，但謂「兵器雖少不仍可以戰勝嗎，一則是不行的。今日所以一再會有那種勝利的記錄，乃因日軍將士的精神補足了軍火的不敷。今後，在這種可貴的精神以外，將飛機等兵器大量送往前綫、方才可以使日軍的必勝勢態成為完璧。完全勝利的途徑，除此以外，沒有第二條。（海軍報道班員森正廠）（吉：譯自十二月十六日週刋每日）</p>

<h3>N飛行士的雙瞳</h3>
<p>在那激戰的餘暇，海軍戰關襪隊的少年航空兵給我看一本人名錄。指着同期生的紀念照片：「這人死了；這人也不在了。這人還健在着。至於這……我看着那旨頭點的地下，不知不覺地垂下了</p>
<p>N上等飛行兵曹的雙瞳閃閃地發光：「畫師，我們在把澳洲完全征服前·還要活着呢！</p>
<p>這裹見划我海軍航空隊之無限的戰關精神。敵人恃着其席大的生產力，屢北屢戰。有時竟至於旁者無人。</p>
<p>安蓬〇〇基地的黑暗的士官室巾，年宵的小隊長，义着手，似吐血般：「現在苦了，飛機不足」。下面的話也不必聽了。我一面睨着黑暗的夭空，一面咒且着：畜生！現在完了！螢火蟲掛在無數的樹木間閃閃地發光，瑩也在黑音裹發着光哪！（加藤荣三書）（根據朝日新聞製）</p>

<h3>嫁衣</h3>
<p>— 任淑芳</p>
<p>三月的天充滿着春意，園裹的景色是那麼的迷人，連池中的水也被垂柳撩起了波紋，梅芬倚在園門上意識到這是她出生後第三十個春天了。想到這裹她顯然有些傷感，她覺她得到一個暗示，就是靑春已經向她吿辭了，衰老的陰影一天天嗤着她的心房，以後的日子將怎麼樣，她不敢再想！</p>
<p>這天是梅芬的生日，她的兩個妹妹蘭芬菊芬早就嚷着要替她做壽，但是妹妹們的好意反而觸起了她的心事，她依稀記得在她二十歲生日那天她母親曾撫着地肩說：「梅兒，這是你在家中最後的一個整生日，到三十歲該有你的丈夫來替你做生日了」</p>
<p>當時梅芬羞澀地低了頭，她的確相信再過十年她一定也有孩子了，但是十年一　眼過去了，她還是在家裹，這些事就像針一樣刺着她的心，她想痛快的哭一塲，但是她得親自去點香燭，親自下廚房做菜，當她跪下和父母叩頭的時候，她覺眼淚不是極力忍住，就耍流出來，母親的臉上也添了一層憂鬱。</p>
<p>在方公館裹大小姐梅芬是最能幹的一位，除了不懂英文和科學外，中文根基是相當好，能寫一手靈飛經和文言文，對於家務不管是煮飪縫紉樣樣都來得，尤其是刺繍是方大小姐最拿手的，方太太年歲老了，女兒又這麼能幹，所以方公館這份人家都由梅芬小姐一手主持着。</p>
<p>二小蘭芬也利大小姐一樣沒有受過學校敎育，人又沒有梅芬精明，可是好說話也是在方公館裹一出名的，至於三小姐菊芬一則因為年紀輕些，二則個性又很堀强，所以三個女孩子中只有她才爭到受新敎育的機會，現在已經讀到高中了，功課不壞，人又是决頂的玲瓏，就是嘴不大肯讓人。</p>
<p>這幾年來使得方太太和方老爺日夜担着心事的就是三位小姐的婚事，她沒有兒子，唯一的仰望却在得到二個好女婿上。菊芬雖祗二十歲，梅芬已三十了，而蘭芬也有二十七歲，歷年來向這二位小姐來說婚的到也不少，但是方太太和方老爺，不是嫌人家窮就是嫌人太多，又非元配不可，於是日子一天天過去，女兒的婚事也就無形中耽擱下來。現在她眼看着女兒的年歲不小了，心裹着實焦急起來。</p>
<p>秋天裹方老爺的朋友，江老先生親自來為他姪兒說媒，他姪兒在一年前死了妻子，現在是預備娶個續絯，前妻還留下兩個孩子，江家也是世家，一切都很熟悉，在從前方老爺准會一口回絕，方家的小姐是非元配不給的，現在却滿口地答應下來，結果把二位小姐的照片都拿了去，任江家挑選一個。</p>
<p>這件事對於菊芬的是毫無興趣，但是對於梅芬和蘭芬都起了很大的作用，尤其是梅芬她竟整夜的失眠起來，當然希望她能中選，並日覺得做姐姐的騵該比妹妹先出嫁，白天裹她常坐着發怔，夜裹又不能安眠，人顯然是憔悴多了。</p>
<p>一星期後江老先生送回音來，選中的是二小姐蘭芬，原因是江少爺自己也才三十二歲，所以梅券小姐的年紀似乎嫌大了些。方太太雖然也希望選中梅芬，但是事巳如此，好歹總算一個女兒有了着落，於是兩家就决定在當年冬天裹訂婚，預備明年春天結婚。</p>
<p>闌芬聽見了這事，一點沒有異議，一切都由她母親做主。但是梅芬非但感到失望，並目覺得受到重大的侮辱，整整地哭了一夜，又怕妹妹和用人們恥笑，白天裹强作歡容，背書人總是彈淚，訂婚禮舉行過了，方公館漸漸忙碌起來。方太太因為年齡關係不能多勞神，於是對於購置嫁妝的事一起交給了梅芬，而梅芬對於這些事均件件都是觸目傷心，但是表面上祗得裝作高興的樣子，過了年轉眼就是春天，蘭芬的結婚日子巳經擇定了，大家都是喜氣洋洋的。</p>
<p>一天下午梅芬坐在自己屋子裹，蘭芬忽然柑門進來坐在梅芬的旁邊，低了頭好像要說甚麼話。本來她們姐妹感情非常的好，就是爲了這次婚事，梅芬對於蘭芬有說不出的怨恨，但是表面上是從未露出過。</p>
<p>「二妹！有什麼事嗎？」梅芬等了她一會，看勉又不開口，有些不耐煩起來。</p>
<p>「大姊：我想……請求你一件事。」</p>
<p>「別吞吞吐吐好不好！有甚麼事快說呀。」</p>
<p>「我想請你替我繡件衣服，預備富天脫去禮服穿的。」</p>
<p>一你結婚怎麼呌我做衣服呢？」梅芬覺得她的創傷又裂開了。</p>
<p>「好姐姐！我請你這點事都不肯答應嗎？你刺繡比我好呀？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「好姐姐你就答應了我吧，我一定好好謝你！一</p>
<p>一好吧！」梅芬，嚥下了眼淚，終於答應下來</p>
<p>費了一個月的工夫衣服完成了，那淡緋色的軟鍛配上了綘色的牡丹花，那麼調勻的色彩那麼精緻的繡工，誰見了都贊不絕口。</p>
<p>蘭芬出嫁了·結婚那天穿了那件繡花衣服賓客們的贊聲不停地送到梅芬小姐前，很是他並不覺得一些喜悅。</p>
<p>日子像水一般無情的流去，蘭芳出嫁後使梅芳更寂寞起來，菊芬有功課又常不在家，除在花園裹逗留一會，就是整天悶在房裹。</p>
<p>菊芬今年畢業了，隨同這畢　喜訊一同來的，就是菊芬向她爸媽提出了裹的一位年輕的英文敎師</p>
<p>方太太對於這使她毫不操心的婚事當然表示同意，但在方老太爺嚴格的詢問之下，才知道這位未來的新女婿是一個孤兒除了她自己的一個腦子和雙手以外，是一無所有，並且又是遙遠的北方人，這些立刻引起了方老爺的反對，覺得像他們這樣世家的小姐，决不能去嫁一個身家寒微的窮敎員，方太太也捨不得把女兒送到那麼遠的地方去。</p>
<p>無疑地父女的爭執開始了，道事傳到了梅芬那裹，立刻趕過來，方老爺已經氣靑了臉。</p>
<p>「爸爸！婚姻是有關一一個人的終身幸福，最要緊的是雙方有感情，我們還年輕，錢是可以用手和腦去換來的；至於門第這更談不到了，我是嫁一個人，不是嫁給一家人家。」菊芬理直氣壮地說了一大篇。</p>
<p>方老爺覺得女兒這樣說話，簡直太無禮貌，馬上站起來。</p>
<p>「好！你除非自己去結婚，我决不答應！」說着就拂着袖子出去了。</p>
<p>在這塲父女衝突後，梅芬把菊芬勸到房裹，菊芬流着淚激動的說。</p>
<p>一大姐？爸爸這樣固執，使我眞受不了，媽又腦經陳舊，您的婚事怎麼會蹉跎至今，二姐又怎麼會做人家續弦，這一切都是他們造成的。他們並沒有想到一個人祇有這麼一個靑春，而失去了永遠不會回來。」</p>
<p>概芬覺得三妹的話句句都說到地的心裹，便和菊芳分相對地流起淚來，但是她想她自已對於婚姻除非是極頂的遷就，這一生的希望是很少了。</p>
<p>「大姐！我預備再和爸和媽去說一次，假使再不答應我就走了。」「走！三妹別這樣想吧！我一定帮你在爸爸面前去說。」</p>
<p>第二天姐妹倆鼓足了勇氣到方老夫婦面前去，但澴是得到同樣的結果。</p>
<p>菊芳覺得事情已在逼緊她，這樣一來非但婚事是絕望了，並且她和她愛人的共同到農村去創辦學校的美麥也全粉碎了。這些事都需要在短短的暑期裹去解决，她知道猶疑和畏縮决不會有利於　的前途的，最後當暑假快要結束的時候，她决定了勉自己應走的路那便是……走</p>
<p>梅芬一面同情她三妹的遭遇，一面傷感她自己的終身，現在她的靑春是被葬送了，覺得不應該使她妹妹再走同樣的路，於是她也竟贊成菊芬的走，並且帮助她走。</p>
<p>初秋的夜裹，梅芬帮她理着東西，忽然想着什麼事，很快地走了出去，再來時手裹拿了一句東西</p>
<p>「三妹！你這一走也不知什麼時侯再見，這是一件我自己繡得嚴得意的衣服，預備結婚時穿的，可是現在我也不想再出嫁了，這件衣服就送給你做個紀念吧：並且望你在結婚那天把它穿穿。」走全靠你的帮助，我一定照你的意思去做，可是爸媽……」</p>
<p>「這你放心好了，我會照顧她們的，這家裹一切都有我。」菊芬流淚望　那件富麗輝煌的衣服，黑緞子上繡着紅的鳳凰嵌着金綫，感激得說不出話來。</p>
<p>早上天未全亮，菊芬走了，梅芬覺得心胸橫添了一層愉快，雖然她還得過半輩子尼庵似的生活，但是牠想到自己時常頭眩心悸和胃痛，也知道自己不會長久地做塊化石了</p>
<h3>寒冬吟</h3>
<p>— 石舟</p>
<p>刺骨的寒風，</p>
<p>吹得馬路邊的積水凍冰。街上的行人，</p>
<p>都露出瑟縮的表情。</p>
<p>這時候：</p>
<p>在陳列着冬季新裝的店裹，</p>
<p>走出來兩位麽登的女人。一位是：</p>
<p>妖媚的臉龐伴着狐狸皮的圍巾。</p>
<p>一位是：</p>
<p>滿身雪白的茸毛襯着鮮紅的嘴唇。</p>
<p>她們正談得起勁。</p>
<p>剛轉灣，沒有幾步，忽然「呀一了一聲，連忙走下人行道，</p>
<p>「啊唷姆媽！嚇殺人，」原來在牆脚邊破蘆蓆下，</p>
<p>伸出着兩條凍僵的人脚。一個拾荒的孩子在街上冷得發抖，</p>
<p>雖然他媽給他套上一件破舊的大掛。</p>
<p>下身只有一條單褲，</p>
<p>赤着的脚上拖了一雙又破又大的鞋。</p>
<p>寒風吹上來冷得可怕。回家吧</p>
<p>又要受母親的打駡。只好忍着寒冷一步一步的挨。</p>
<p>一夜西風，早吹得落葉滿街。</p>
<p>一雙紅羅葡般的手，將牠們一把一把地爬。「昨天拾得的煮不熱紅米粥，</p>
<p>今天抬得這麼多媽媽一定非常歡喜龍。</p>
<p>他想着：</p>
<p>凍紅的臉上不覺透出一絲愉快的微笑。</p>

<h3>什麽樣能使肌肉發達介紹劉克忠簡易運動方法</h3>
<p>本文作者趙竹光君是上海健身學院院長及健力美雜誌的主辦人。年來趙君對體格鍛鍊提倡不遺餘力；幷已造就不少人才。其著譯有「肌肉發達法」「體格鍛鍊法大全」「最新啞鈴鍛鍊迭等」二十餘種。故特請趙君把肌肉發達的方法介紹個給續者。——編者</p>
<p>就一般而詢，國人體格之不及水準，巳是一件無可諱言的事。所以為着本身的幸福和國家民族的前途，我們都有急起直追，加速把自己的體格鍊到強健起來之必耍。</p>
<p>嚴格的講起來，體格鍛鍊應包括運動，休息和營飬的三者。關於第一點，假如能在專家的指導之下來鍊，自然更好。否則如能跟着一種適當的方法鍛鍊，亦可得到相當的收效。但運動須持之有恒。若一曝十裴，或一星期只鍊了一兩次後，便希望有驚人的收效，來拿皮尺量量，得不到如期的收效時，易怪某種運動方法不好，那是一種不合常理的事情。因為發達肌肉的運動，究非神術，不能當時或隔天便可將身體的肌肉弄大起來，而有待於體素之慢慢增長。</p>
<p>休息也是佔體格鍛鍊之重要部分。其中最主要的，就是睡眠。因為在睡眠中，日間由於活動而被破壞的細胞，得有一個重生的機會。休息又分肉體與精神兩者。假如我們以為旣進行鍛鍊身體·就不必有合理化的生活那决不會得到多大的收效。</p>
<p>在目前來講營養根本是一個困難的問題。不過假如我們的環境是優越的自然最好是食蛋類牛奶和瘦的肉類及蔬菜。但假如我們的環境是平常的，可從豆類，尤其是黃豆中來取得我們的脂肪和蛋白質。從蔬菜中，尤其是葉綠的菜蔬中，來獲得我們身體所需的鑛質和維他命。</p>
<p>為着適應於大多數社會人士的體弱和經濟條件起見，我們這次所介紹的動作都無需器械的。這些運動又名之為自力或自抗力運。</p>
<p>運動一</p>
<p>兩足舒適地分開的站着全身鬆懈，兩臂徐徐往上舉起，同時深深的吸氣。這時腹外張。當吸至不能再吸的時候，稍事停頓（但不宜停頓過久，以舒適為度），身體下彎：同時呼氣，並將兩臂在胸前交又將胸部加以壓縮，俾將肺部所貯的空氣盡可能地趕出。這時腹內縮。可由六次做起，逐漸加至十二次。</p>
<p>運動二</p>
<p>面足站立如前，兩手叉腰，先將身體側向左邊去，當側至不能再左的時候，還原；再側向右邊去。每次側向一邊去的時吸氣，還原時呼。在整個動作的進行，兩腿應保持正直姿勢。</p>
<p>初時每邊可由六次做共二十次。這是一個緞練腹部兩側肌肉的動作。</p>
<p>運動三</p>
<p>仰臥地上，兩臂伸直在身旁按在地上。上身不動，兩腿伸且往上舉起同時吸氣。直至雨腿與身體成九十度角的時候，稍事停頓，放下重做。當兩腿旣往上舉起而在停頓中的時候，可將頭頸同時仰起，使頸部也得到一種充分的遝動。當兩腿放下時呼氣。</p>
<p>當做這個運動的時候，有一點應配着的，便是兩腿上舉時，兩腿必須伸區（對於年紀較大或腹部太胖的人，　部可略彎，但以後部設法傳匱）。還原時，全身必須鬆懈，不可僵硬，可盡自巳能力做去，至二十五次為止。</p>
<p>運動四</p>
<p>先將兩足舒適地分開的第着，用左手按在右手上，然後右臂從伸直的姿勢中，徐徐用力往上彎起，同時左手也施以相當的抵抗力。及彎至高度與肩齊時，還原重做。上彎時吸氣，還原時呼；可做十至十五次，兩臂必須做上同樣的次數，這是一個很好的變頭肌（即上臂前部）運勁。</p>
<p>運動五</p>
<p>先用兩手按在地上兩幫伸直，爾手的距離，約和兩肩之間度相等，全身伸直，用兩手和兩足尖，以支持全身的重量·腿臂下降，同時呼氣及胸部幾觸即底下時，兩臂徐徐用力往上撐起，同時吸氣及兩臂完全伸直爲止·這是一個發達胸肌很好的運動，同時對於肩部和三頭肌的發達上，也有很大的幫助。</p>
<p>初時可盡自己的能力做去，能做到超二十次以上，可改用兩　，或將足部踏高來做。</p>
<p>運動六</p>
<p>兩足舒適地分開的站着，兩手义腰，全身正直，然後屈膝下蹲，同時呼氣，當辦到的確低到不能再低時，起立，幷將足提起，同時盡力把六　和小腿的肌肉竭力收縮起來·起立時深深的吸氣，可般十至一十次·能超過一十次後，可用單腿支持全身的重量來做。使腿部的肌肉有一種進一步的動作。</p>
<p>以上看到大運動作是從本院附設的肌肉發達函授課程中擴出來的。如能　眞的　去，我們自可以見到自己全身的肌肉一天天的發達起來·僅祝讀者諸君在不久的將來，都能練成一　變力的體格！</p>

<p>按籃球織術，由五人聯防而進展至人釘人，自盛頓大舉球隊，更進步至破人釘人必須用烟幕擋華聯藥在張滋祥領導之下，雖無新戰術之表演，然對於上述諸點，頗能力求成功，似已臻純靑之境，洵値得欽佩。茲介紹全隊虎將如后：</p>
<p>領隊張　祥——為中法醫科大學畢業，註冊藥濟師即以此名。張君係籃球隊即以此名。張君係籃球健將，前嘗代表藥光隊，此番組織華聯藥原以精神為主，奪得燦爛之錦標，初無雄心，有此意外收獲，內心欣慰，可以知矣</p>
<p>隊長孔廣益——為球壇宿將，十年前代表靑光巳喧赫一時。至今實刃不老，不護後起，出任隊長，臨陣指揮，厥功非小。</p>
<p>後衛瞿錫麟——亦籃球之老將，有聰明敵捷之腦筋，作戰時鎭靜異常，功夫奇佳，門檻亦精，有一夫當關。萬人莫過之慨。翟君前服務於中央儲蓄會。，奪得冠軍。在西靑籃尤以擊退巨人蒙納克兩不能廣減，茲先抄起金</p>
<p>中鋒吳成章——綽號阿弟，可知其年事尙輕，季前尙　乙級冰隊，然此次突加入甲級，表演甚佳，實後起入秀。其藍下鑒球，奔馳之迅，大有負盛名之陳學　作風，有謂有過之無不及，信然！</p>
<p>右鋒張蘭崙——身體健碩·爲典型籃球前鋒，賴某氣足，看人功夫，勝人一等·而能東靈西奔，使敵術防不勝防，是爲其特點。</p>
<p>左鋒張銷璇——係錢系弟子作風向稍上流·其特點在半途中突出截球，在左角射籃，具十中九之把握，難能可貴·</p>
<p>全能張良雄——張君後術前鋒均所擅長，前隷梁溪隊，已爲人所愛截，息影已久。今番重作馮婦，爲華聯藥爭功不少·其唯一之好處，在絕度驚駭之局面中，能防冷箭，且必多奇效，大有起死回生之術。</p>

<h3>籃球裁判難（梅必賢）——西靑發生毆打裁判有感——</h3>
<p>過去毆打裁判事件，時常發生，即使在嚴重的全國運動會中，竟免不了暴發，實在是遺憾的事！然而在最近，滬上比賽，似乎難見，這是運動精神道德的進展，何等可喜，不幸前週西靑球房又見是項情件，乃有所惑。</p>
<p>籃球裁判難</p>
<p>在各種球類比賽中，我以爲籃球裁判最難做，像足球比較得過程慢，而且最值得注意的是越位和罰球，何况兩邊多有巡邊員，排球除了過網和重接外就極少難判的規則，唯有籃球因為過程　張規則多而嚴，所以我覺得籃球裁判最難。現在敢就管見所及，略貢獻於各界之前，籃球裁判之除了普通　須備是的條件外，我敢就管見所及。覺得應該有下列幾點，值得研討</p>
<p>態度莊嚴</p>
<p>有謂籃球裁判應該利藹，我以為不然。籃球裁判一定要莊嚴，表示神聖不可侵犯，尤其在休息時間，絕不能和球員多作談話，以減少情惑作用，在無形中滋長。更之，不論在極緊張或者極鬆弛的戰局中，始終那樣莊嚴着，否則在不緊要的球賽中嘻皮笑臉着，就減少了球員們的敬仰心。所以說，籃球裁判不是和藹可親，應該莊嚴。</p>
<p>笛聲研究</p>
<p>一般總以為笛聲愈多則佳，其實不然。笛聲是事實之發生，不是事實之結果，所以我以為擲進球的狂吹，是多餘的。笛聲一多，是增加球員和觀衆的厭惡，所以不必要的笛聲，越少越妙。其次笛擊應該有分別，如犯規一定要略長而響亮，出界可以輕而短促，以示事態之嚴重與否？而在球員有誤繼擲球時，則應該用……斷斷續續的笛聲。像徑賽有偷跑一樣的吹法，未免得球員們再加誤會，不致消耗比賽時寶貴的分秒。</p>
<p>心理作用</p>
<p>許多裁判碰到有名的球員時，心理上會突起變化，隨着該球員的種種暗示之態度而作目標，這是絕對錯誤的。因為裁判是最高的權威，欲抱定自己的初衷，一有所忌，則必致一誤再誤，心理上絕對不能有所顧忌。</p>
<p>其他應該少和球員作無謂的應酬；裁判同人應時作實習和研究，俾使每個裁判，都能成功最標華典型的公正者，使球員們觀衆們得到最好的印象，</p>
<p>本市有裁判會的組織，連絡亦多，然大概注意在友誼上，我以為應該着重在研討，因為任何事情是無止境的，尤其應當多作實地練習，則成功必有可觀。更希望裁判能公，時常有研究的文字刋載各報，俾使球員觀衆有所領悟，誤會之點自然減少，毆打事情，更可消減矣。</p>

<h3>Suppressing Stock Speculation</h3>
<p>"The current widespread phenomenon of stock speculation is all caused by ordinary 'industrial companies'. Clever people, with keen insight, put up the signboard of an 'industrial company.' In the board of directors, they arrange the big names of 'industrialists,' flaunt astonishing amounts of capital to the public, boast and exaggerate, fabricate news of hidden profits, and take advantage of the public's unwillingness to sit idly by as the value of their money gradually diminishes. They rush to buy and sell stocks, running around the speculative market, and as a result, extract the hard-earned money of the people."</p>
<p>"Currently, most 'industrial companies' have a huge discrepancy between their stock price and their actual value, and in essence, they all operate solely on speculation and manipulation. And a group of companies, seeing the golden age of stock speculation, are each utilizing their own stocks to embark on the path of 'industrial companies.' For example, film studios, food companies, real estate companies, etc."</p>
<p>The above excerpt is from what Mr. Yoshida Toyu said in yesterday's weekly commentary in this newspaper. It can also be said to be what we want to say. At the same time, it is also a serious wartime economic pathology, a deplorable wartime suicide phenomenon.</p>
<p>Since the securities exchange resumed operations last October and started trading stocks, it has gradually evolved into the current chaotic situation of stock speculation frenzy in a few months, which was definitely not anticipated. The purpose of the stock exchange resuming operations and trading stocks was, of course, to invigorate finance, promote industrial and commercial prosperity, and increase production. However, the current result is the opposite, merely creating a frenzy of speculative psychology. Why is it that a correct method and a good system, after being adopted by the Chinese people, turn into tools for speculation? The orange turns into a trifoliate orange when it crosses the Huai River. It is truly heartbreaking to say. And Mr. Yoshida, as a Japanese, points out our shortcomings from his mouth, revealing them thoroughly, which should especially make those with a conscience feel uneasy.</p>
<p>In recent months, companies in various industries have been established one after another, with a wide variety of names. Very few of them are operating properly. Although most of them claim to be engaged in some kind of industrial and commercial business, the actual content is just opening a few offices and placing a few desks. They publish advertisements to solicit shares, and before the share capital is even fully collected, the black market price of the stock exceeds the face value. After the company holds its founding meeting, it does not focus on business but hurriedly finds ways to list the stock. After listing, it tries its best to push up the stock price, so that the market price of the stock exceeds its face value by a considerable amount, and then uses the excuse of asset appreciation to carry out capital increases, earning several times the profit in a short period of time. Moreover, the mentality of semi-official speculative elements and merchant speculative elements is that the larger the company's capital, the greater the profit; the smaller the face value of the stock, the more widespread the attraction; and the more companies established, the more ways to make money. As a result, the national economy is increasingly exploited and declines. Furthermore, after establishing a new company, the share capital received by that company is used to establish another company, layer upon layer, just like the hoarders of the past, who use the hoarded goods as collateral for loans, then hoard more goods, then borrow more money. The more loans, the more hoarded goods, and the more ill-gotten gains. When the hoarded goods are once bought up and they cannot make up the difference in the black market price, they commit suicide or go bankrupt. In the end, it is not a pity that such people commit suicide or go bankrupt, but it is unforgivable that they disrupt the wartime national economy, causing the value of currency to fall and prices to rise, making the lives of the masses more and more difficult. We dare to say that the manipulators and hoarders of the past are the stock manipulators of today. These people are innate speculators, who use speculative tricks anytime and anywhere, seeking only profit and disregarding the overall wartime situation. If the government does not severely punish them and society does not have the power to restrain them, then the more rampant speculation is, the more chaotic the society will be, and the more painful the lives of the people will be.</p>
<p>Stock speculation is currently a very serious wartime economic pathology. The government authorities naturally cannot turn a blind eye. We offer a few suggestions:</p>
<p>According to item 2 of the examination principles of the Exchange Management Committee for listed stocks: "The company has been established and operating for more than one year." Item 2 of the Organizational Rules of the Supervision Committee: "Various securities must be approved by the Supervision Committee before they can be traded on the market." Therefore, it is illegal that 27 stocks have been listed recently without being reviewed by the committee. And the exchange authorities listed and traded stocks that have not been reviewed and approved. What is the basis for this? How can they claim to be unaware of the review rules? This is indeed likely to promote speculation. The exchange authorities should be subject to appropriate punishment. Now that the Supervision Committee has ordered these 27 stocks to suspend trading, it is very proper. However, during the review, the provisions of the "Review Principles" should be strictly followed, and stocks of companies that have not been operating for more than one year should absolutely not be allowed to be listed.</p>
<p>On January 20 of this year, the Central News Agency reported that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that idle funds in various places are competing for speculation, stimulating prices, and disrupting finance, and that various companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises are also tending towards speculative transactions, in order to prevent the spread, decided to stop the establishment of new companies from January 21, and hoped that merchants and people would invest in production-increasing industries, and not engage in speculative companies, so as not to suffer losses. This restriction by the Ministry of Industry is indeed very wise, but while restricting establishment on the one hand, new companies are still being established one after another on the other hand. Therefore, it must be strictly enforced, with no exceptions. If establishment is carried out without permission, it should be ordered to stop operations and punished. The capital increase of companies should also be strictly reviewed to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>Separation of government and business is what we have always advocated. And it is also clearly stipulated by the government that civil servants are not allowed to engage in commerce concurrently. However, ignorant officials, although they do not come forward themselves, use relatives and old friends to come forward to operate, and use special conveniences to do whatever they want. As a result, speculative merchants fuel the flames and take advantage of their power. We hope that the government authorities will conduct a thorough investigation with the spirit of impartiality and selflessness, so that the intermediate elements who do not separate government and business have no way to use their tricks, and give speculative merchants a head-on blow. For example, semi-official companies, using the publicity of propaganda organs, squeeze into the speculative group and try their best to push up the stock price, making it soar and reaping huge profits, which makes ordinary speculative merchants envious, and the speculative atmosphere is even more intense. We hope that the government authorities will start rectifying from this type of semi-official company first.</p>
<p>Now that the stocks listed on the exchange have been approved, in order to prevent speculation and promote production enterprises, a new standard should be strictly set and re-examined. All stocks of industrial and commercial enterprises that are not directly productive should not be allowed to be listed. Stocks that are labeled as production enterprises but do not have actual production equipment, or that have equipment but do not engage in production, should also not be allowed to be listed. Private trading and dark market transactions of stocks that are not allowed to be listed should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>In short, we have now reached the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. The participating countries should contribute their lives to jointly strive for victory, and China cannot be an exception. And Shanghai is an important economic center in the rear. Not only has it failed to make its wartime economic contribution, but today, individuals are keen on stock speculation and obsessed with getting rich. The government authorities should quickly suppress this, as it is an urgent and unavoidable task.</p>
<h3>Displaying Power on the India-Burma Border: Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Enemy Positions; Air Combat Occurs in Buthidaung, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the British-Indian army's disastrous defeat at Arakan in the spring counter-offensive against Burma, they have repeatedly announced a counter-offensive against Burma in October, but have been blocked by the Japanese army and unable to launch it. Recently, the British-Indian army on the Burma-India border has completed preparations for a counter-offensive. They have repeatedly attacked with small forces on the Maungdaw-Buthidaung front to test the strength of the Japanese army, while continuously gathering troops behind the front lines. The Japanese army air force took advantage of the clear weather on the 4th to fly in large numbers to the Buthidaung area, fiercely bombing enemy troops attempting to move, and engaging enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage. When the Japanese army air force bombed the Buthidaung front on the morning of the 4th, they encountered a formation of eight enemy aircraft, including Spitfire fighters and B38s. The enemy aircraft formation was chaotic and attempted to escape. The Japanese aircraft immediately pursued and shot down two of them, then cooperated with Japanese ground forces to fiercely bomb enemy positions in front of Buthidaung. At this time, the enemy's front line was just being reinforced from the rear with anti-aircraft artillery, anti-aircraft machine gun units, truckloads of troops, and infantry units, which were perfect targets for the Japanese aircraft to bomb. The enemy positions were repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, and soon caught fire, with flames soaring into the sky, causing extremely heavy damage. After completing their mission, all Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defense positions.</p>
<p>Burma, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base on the Burma-India border on the 6th: The Japanese navy air force attacked enemy facilities near Kuttalabaur, 600 miles north of Ceylon, in the Bay of Bengal, India, on the night of the 4th, carrying out a first bombing, causing fires everywhere.

In the afternoon of the same day, they attacked an enemy transport group in the sea south of Bougainville Island with low-altitude bombing, inflicting heavy damage, and all aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in the South Pacific: In the area of Zemberi (33 kilometers southeast of Madang) on New Guinea Island, three enemy torpedo boats attacked on the night of the 2nd. The Japanese artillery units immediately opened fire and repelled one of them with heavy damage. On the same night, three torpedo boats attacked the northern coast of Arlene, and after being fiercely bombarded by the Japanese artillery units, one of them was sunk immediately.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the South Pacific: The air raids on Japanese army bases in New Guinea are becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese troops are bravely repelling them, inflicting great damage on the enemy each time. Details of each battle are described below: On January 31, 13 enemy E25s and 12 P40s, totaling 25 aircraft, attacked Bubun, about 100 kilometers northwest of Madang.

<h3>Severe Food Shortage in Australia</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The situation in Australia is difficult in all aspects. According to a dispatch from Canberra on the 5th, Australia is currently encountering extremely serious problems, namely labor and food. Australia is currently supplying a large amount of food to the anti-Axis countries, but due to a shortage of labor, it is unable to transport it out. Recently, about 2,000 workers per month have returned to the countryside from Australia's military and ordnance factories to increase food production. However, the lack of necessary phosphate fertilizer in the agricultural sector is also a difficult problem, as Australia's phosphate fertilizer has been imported from Nauru Island. In addition, volcanic eruptions have occurred repeatedly in various parts of Victoria and New South Wales, which is also a factor contributing to the reduction in agricultural production. Therefore, Australia is no longer able to continuously supply butter and cheese to Britain, and meat production is also reduced due to the death of a large number of livestock in volcanic eruptions.</p>
<h3>Japanese University Students to Receive Naval Military Training: Instilling Knowledge to Strengthen National Defense</h3>

However, the German army has repelled the attacks of the concentrated Soviet forces. The Soviet army in the area between Kirovograd and Belaya Tserkov continues to attack the German army fiercely with strong forces, but has not succeeded. The German army launched a counterattack, crushing their stubborn resistance, breaking through the Soviet army's strong fortifications, and continuing to advance, inflicting heavy damage on the Soviet army. In the southern Beter swamp area, the German army repelled the attacking Soviet army with infantry and cavalry units. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

<h3>German Counteroffensive Launched on the Cisterna Front; Street Fighting in Cassino Continues</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - In the Cisterna war zone east of Rome, fierce fighting has been taking place in the past day or two. According to a dispatch from Algiers on the 5th: Large units of the German army in that war zone, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, have launched a fierce counterattack against the anti-Axis bridgehead. The current Cisterna battle is one of the most intense battles on the Italian front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the German News Agency: Yesterday, the German army tightened its encirclement of the anti-Axis forces at the Nettuno bridgehead and repelled reinforcements attempting to rescue them. The fighting in Cassino on the southern Italian front is very fierce. For several days, the two armies have fought for this city, gaining and losing it repeatedly. Currently, half of the city is in the hands of the German army, and half is occupied by the enemy army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the German News Agency: February 4 was a dark day for the British army on the Nettuno front. Since the anti-Axis forces landed there, the German army launched its first large-scale offensive on this day, annihilating the British army that broke into the Rome-Cisterna railway. The encirclement was completed within seven hours. Therefore, the first part of the offensive mission was completed at 6:00 AM that morning. At that time, the German army launched a joint offensive in two directions, encircling several brigades of the British army, and is now concentrating on annihilating them. About 600 enemy troops were captured at noon that day. The dense German artillery fire and hand grenades caused confusion in the British army units, resulting in heavy casualties. Before launching the offensive, the German artillery bombarded the enemy for half an hour, first causing confusion in their ranks, and then the infantry launched a positional offensive. German armored forces attacked from both flanks to encircle the British army. The rainy weather affected the activities of the enemy air force, so the German offensive was quite convenient. The British army may send troops from the south to rescue this heavy encirclement, but the encircled British army is already in a desperate situation. It is only a matter of time before they are annihilated.</p>

In terms of foreign affairs, Spain has no special reason to participate in the war. To date, no special incidents have occurred that have damaged the country's reputation or territorial sovereignty. The borders of Spain are respected by the belligerent countries. If this situation does not change, Spain has no reason to revise its foreign policy. In order to maintain unconditional neutrality, Spain demands that the belligerent countries respect its independence.</p>

<h3>Coal Ingots Arriving Continuously, Preparation to Expand Rationing - Eleven Coal Merchants Join New Organization</h3>
<p>Thai Language Newspaper Report: According to reliable sources yesterday, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will be reorganized and renamed the Da Zhong Lian Coal Ingot Control Association to strengthen unified coal ingot distribution.

It is also heard that the stock of coal ingots in this port has been continuously arriving from other ports recently, and the quantity is quite considerable. The authorities are paying close attention to it and are preparing to implement expanded rationing measures. In fact, with ample sources, the fuel market has shown significant improvement, and it is widely believed that it will eventually stabilize.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Electricity Distribution Deliberation Organization</p>
<p>At the same time, according to a Japanese newspaper report, in order to prevent excessive coal ingot consumption, a "Electricity Distribution Deliberation Organization" will be jointly established by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the citizens to set up an Electricity Distribution Deliberation Committee to adjust coal ingot distribution and use electricity for legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>Hope for Early Delivery of Cooked Water Coal</p>
<p>The First District Office, in view of the close relationship between cooked water shops and the citizens, especially during the current coal shortage when the need for cooked water is even greater, has designated Yi Tai Xing, Lin Hao, and other well-known coal companies to be responsible for supplying cooked water shops with low-priced coal ingots. However, "coal purchase permits" were issued by the First District Office before the Lunar New Year, and the coal payments have also been paid in full by the owners of the cooked water shops. It was learned yesterday that these coal ingots have not yet been delivered, making the situation of the cooked water shops even more difficult. It is now urgently hoped that the delivery can be made as soon as possible to meet the emergency needs, otherwise, the cooked water shops will be completely closed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tram Company Changes Route Names, Effective from the 15th</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Tram Company's Traffic Department, for the convenience of passengers' memory, the tram company has decided to change the names of the operating routes, effective from the 15th. The details are as follows: The Route 8 tram running between Tilanqiao and Yangjingbang will be renamed Route 7. The Route 14 trolleybus between Zhengjia Muqiao and the North Railway Station will be renamed Route 17. The Route 17 trolleybus between the Great World and Sichuan Road Bridge will be renamed Route 14. The Route 20 trolleybus between Jing'an Temple and Zhaofeng Park will be renamed Route 21. The one running between Jing'an Temple and the Bund on Sima Road will still be called Route 20. The Route 16 trolleybus in Caojiadu will be renamed Route 15, while the one running between Sanjingqiao and Maigen Road will still be called Route 16.</p>
<h3>Non-Controlled Goods Transport Strictly Prohibited, No Obstruction - Second Bureau Reinstructs Subordinates to Proceed</h3>
<p>Regarding the transport of non-controlled goods in this city, military and police are not allowed to intercept them arbitrarily to alleviate merchants' difficulties. The municipal government has issued orders to investigate and prohibit this, and has repeatedly warned, but although many military and police officers in various districts comply with the orders, there are still some who do not understand the truth and often prohibit the transport of these non-controlled goods, which is inappropriate. The Second Police Bureau of this city yesterday issued another order to its subordinate branch bureaus that in their respective jurisdictions, the transport of non-controlled goods should be allowed and not obstructed or extorted in the future. If found or exposed, they will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>New Da Bank Relocates, Gift Money Converted to Aid Education</h3>
<p>The New Da Bank in this port, formerly known as Jiu Chang, was renamed New Da, with a paid-up capital of 10 million yuan, engaged in commercial and trust businesses. The bank has the closest relationship with the New-New Company. Li Ze was elected as the chairman of the board, and Yang Fuchen, Zhang Jinglu, Hu Guoliang, and Ou Weiguo were elected as managing directors. Liang Guanliu, Wei Zhiyang, Lai Jihong, He Quansheng, Rao Taoshu, Liu Hanfeng, Yin Peiyuan, Shen Changqing, Xiao Zongjun, and Ruan Qing were elected as directors. Jin Zongcheng was the resident supervisor, and Cheng Hanxing, Yao Yingling, Xi Wuwu, and Gu Kemin were the supervisors. Zhang Jinglu was also appointed as the general manager, and Hu Guoliang was the deputy general manager. It is heard that the bank is relocating to the new site in the northwest of the New-New Company at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Guizhou Road due to business development and insufficient space at the original location. At that time, guests will be entertained, and no invitations will be sent. If anyone sends gifts, it is hoped that they will all send cash, which the bank will double and transfer to the Shen-Xin newspaper student aid and loan fund to cultivate talent and benefit the givers. The original site on Jiangxi Road will be converted into an office, and business will continue as usual.</p>

<h3>Charity Football Grand Event, Unprecedented, China Beats Western Union, Three to Zero, Western Union's Ball Luck Extremely Poor</h3>
<p>The charity football match hosted by the Shanghai Football Association was held at Yi Gang yesterday morning, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The game started at 10:50 am. First, Zhou Jiaqi, the general secretary of the Shanghai Football Association, reported the purpose of the charity match on the radio. Then, the District Office band played music, and Minister Ding personally kicked off the game. Referee Wu Shouheng blew the silver whistle, and Western Union immediately launched an attack. Bao Xiutuo, like a tiger released from its cage, pounced fiercely on China's goal, but fortunately, he missed. China took advantage of the situation to attack. Fei Qinghua went straight in from the wing, dribbled to the penalty area, and kicked at the goal. Mai Youliang caught up and touched the ball to the left corner. At that time, McNeilly was focusing all his attention on the right. As a result, Han Long slapped the ball into the net. A second meritorious service. At the end of the first half, China was ahead by three to zero. During the break, charity footballs were auctioned off, hosted by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Sun Mingqi, etc. As a result, Liuhe Society won the bid for 210,000 yuan, breaking the record for the highest price of a charity football. Changing sides to fight again, Western Union's lineup was adjusted, and the offensive became stronger. In front of China's goal, danger was everywhere. Bao Xiutuo shot twice with force, but they were both saved by Liu Xianhan and were not counted. McEachern kicked from near the goal, and the momentum was extremely fierce, but Xianhan lay down and held it down, and the entire audience applauded warmly. At this time, the ball constantly hovered in front of China's goal, but Western Union repeatedly attacked without success. At 23 minutes, Zhang Lingen fouled in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Robert Stoff. Because he was eager to win, he kicked it right into Liu Xianhan's arms and failed to break the duck egg, which was unfortunate. Western Union gradually showed signs of fatigue, while China, with the victory in hand, did not push too hard, and the game became relaxed. When the whistle blew to end the game, China won 3-0.</p>
<h3>Tonight Western Youth Group A, Eastern vs. Giant</h3>

<p>Economic Circle, Review Translation</p>
<h3>Quickly Raise Countermeasures for Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The soaring prices of goods continue to rise without end. Most people in the Peace District are threatened and struggling in the wild waves of life. The intellectual class, the salaried class, wage laborers, and farmers are all without exception. Those who obtain huge profits from the rise in prices and become rich overnight are less than one percent of the population of speculators. Because of the profiteering of these speculators, the people's livelihood problem is becoming increasingly precarious. It is obviously difficult to build China's wartime economy on this foundation. The basic premise of the wartime economy should be to curb the rise in commodity prices and rationalize the income of the people.</p>
<p>The intellectual class and hardworking people are the backbone of China in the war. If this backbone is exhausted every day by firewood, rice, oil, and salt, how can they have the leisure to engage in other work, and how can China become strong? Looking at the reality of China, those who uphold justice and integrity and are content with their duties are suffering from life, while those who are unrighteous and break the law are generally wealthy. If this situation continues for a long time, can China's morality not fall to the ground? This is not a simple issue of commodity prices. Therefore, thoroughly rectifying speculators and cracking down on speculative behavior is the most effective countermeasure to commodity prices, and it is also absolutely necessary to maintain the morality of China in the war.</p>
<p>However, cracking down on speculative behavior cannot be said to be the solution to the commodity price problem. There are more fundamental countermeasures, such as promoting the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the inland, severing the exploitation of the intermediate layers, and rationalizing and streamlining procurement and distribution. Planned release of bank funds and contraction of speculative funds, etc., can be implemented immediately. If implemented one by one, they can all help solve the commodity price problem.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the commodity price problem is becoming more and more serious. Whether viewed from the perspective of wartime economic construction or from the perspective of national psychological construction, it is absolutely impossible to stand by and do nothing. We dare to ask the National Government again to make the greatest determination and immediately start with effective commodity price controls. (Translated by Xiang from the Mainland News on February 2nd)</p>
<h3>Goods Arrive in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, Supply of Goods Increases Sharply; All Industries Strictly Supervise Trading Among Peers</h3>
<p>In order to increase the stock of materials and stabilize commodity prices, the authorities of this city have actively tried to dredge goods and native raw materials from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong and other places, which has achieved remarkable results. The reporter learned from business circles yesterday that the goods shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned places are constantly on the way, mostly belonging to miscellaneous rights, and raw materials needed in industry, which is of great benefit to the expansion of industry and commerce in this city, and it is not small. It is expected that the supply of various items in this city will increase sharply.</p>
<p>Supervise Trading Among Peers</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the major commodity trade associations, in order to assist the authorities in recovering industry and commerce and suppressing commodity prices, have successively taken the following steps. Namely: Follow the central government's intention to initiate the establishment of trade associations in various industries. Formulate industry rules for trading among peers, and order all member peers to abide by them. Establish an evaluation committee to periodically evaluate and set standard pool limits. Be responsible for distribution matters, so as to curb the black market. In order to crack down on illegal transactions, it is stipulated that all transactions are limited to spot trading.</p>
<p>Prohibit Floating Transactions</p>
<p>It is found that since the authorities ordered the cessation of trading in various markets, general speculative merchants and brokers have suffered serious threats. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, their daily actions are deeply constrained, but their intentions are unpredictable. They dare to carry out floating transactions and illegally operate on various clean roads. It is learned that the relevant authorities will severely punish these treacherous merchants. Once such transactions are found, they will be arrested and prosecuted in court, and investigated according to law, so as to deter others and maintain the market. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will assist in reporting.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry, Increase Loan Rate</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the use of industry funds for speculation and hoarding, the silver and money industry has decided to reject all new loans that are deemed to promote speculation and hoarding after implementing tight lending. If the industry does have legitimate needs, it can be loaned separately as appropriate, and the production situation will be used as the standard. It was recently heard that in addition to raising deposit interest rates to absorb social roaming expenses, the various industries will also raise the interest rate by more than three points for any forgiveness, including credit mortgage, and it is heard that the monthly announcement of deposit and debt interest market by the money industry will raise the debt interest item to 40 yuan. That is, the monthly interest is 4%, and this matter is under close consideration.</p>

<h3>A Tour of the South Pacific Front Line</h3>
<p>A naval aircraft 〇〇, flying out of a certain place in mainland Japan, soared southward over the Pacific Ocean, heading for a certain base on the front line. I and many young naval airmen were on the plane together. They all looked no more than twenty years old. When I inquired about them, some of them were only seventeen years old. Their spirit is really admirable. They all thought that this was the first time they had achieved their long-cherished wish for many years. From now on, they could stand up to the front and meet the American soldiers who were irreconcilable. But what they talked about with each other, without listening for long, you could know that it was innocent, enough to prove that they were all children. Can a group of children like this complete the important work that is the most important factor in the outcome of the war? I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. But soon I realized I had made a big mistake.</p>
<p>Young Airmen</p>
<p>In addition to carrying a white canvas bag containing the bedding issued by the government, each young airman had a tote bag for daily necessities. Compared with the luggage I brought for the planned tour of the front line for dozens of days, it was really pitifully small, so I couldn't help but ask them if this was enough, and a young airman replied, "It's enough to bring things for about two months, because after that, we will die in battle!" Hearing this answer, I couldn't help but be in awe and deeply moved!</p>
<p>In addition to the tote bag, each young airman routinely carried a photo album. I asked several soldiers to take a look at it. Inside were portraits of their parents, photos of themselves as children, as well as pictures taken during sports meets and school trips during their national school days, and also commemorative photos of winning the championship flag at rural youth schools. Finally, there were photos taken in front of their ancestors on the day of their departure. Some of these photos were indeed faded or stained with hand dirt, but they were all neatly pasted. Before reaching their destination, they sat on the plane and flipped through them again and again, exchanging them and reading them with great interest. They probably felt that before the day of glorious death in battle came, they would get encouragement from their parents, support from their childhood friends, and the blessing of their ancestors from this photo album.</p>
<p>Before long, the plane we were on arrived at a base close to the front line. So I said goodbye to this group of young airmen. On one side of the airfield, several new aircraft were neatly arranged, waiting for the young airmen who had arrived here with me. When I was waiting for the plane to take me at one corner of the airfield, the young airmen soon changed into flight suits and boarded the designated aircraft. At this time, they were no longer the children who had just spoken to me. In their eyes, on their faces, there was a determination to kill the enemy and achieve results, and they looked really reliable. What a noble spirit! The current war is a confrontation between the enemy's quantity and our quality. The basis for our ability to constantly overwhelm the enemy and defeat the enemy lies in this noble spirit.</p>
<h3>Farming While Fighting</h3>
<p>The natives living on various islands in the Southern War Zone do not know how to cultivate the land to obtain crops. The enemy, who has long occupied this place, also relied on its own country and other colonies for food. They did not cultivate themselves, nor did they teach the natives. Another reason is that in this sparsely populated area with abundant natural food, there is really no need to cultivate. However, today, tens of thousands of Japanese troops have entered this place, and with the intensification of the war, the transportation of materials sent to the front across the vast ocean is gradually becoming difficult. Food cannot be obtained from the nearby area, nor can it be taken from friendly forces. This is the current situation in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Bismarck Archipelago. After all, fighting on an empty stomach is not a matter of course. How can this difficult problem be solved? Therefore, the generals and soldiers of the Japanese army on the front line resolutely took up the plow.</p>
<p>The land is not unsuitable for cultivation, and the sunlight and rainfall are not insufficient. After cultivation, the seeds brought from the motherland are planted, and things like soybeans, peas, sweet potatoes, gourds, and cabbage sprout, and because of the temperature, they grow very quickly, and some can be harvested within three weeks after sowing. However, the hardship of developing this kind of farmland is not comparable to ordinary.</p>
<p>From reclamation to cultivation, seeing the hardworking situation of the generals and soldiers, just like seeing them handing over with enemy soldiers, makes us feel indescribable admiration. Both of these situations can be said to be due to the indomitable spirit that permeates the entire body of the Japanese soldiers. This strong spirit, on the one hand, overcomes all difficulties and defeats strong enemies, and on the other hand, cleverly overcomes the violent forces of nature. I have also eaten the vegetables grown in this way several times. Every time I put my chopsticks into this vegetable bowl, I can't help but be filled with tears and gratitude.</p>
<h3>SPIRIT OVER MATERIAL</h3>
<p>In the ranks, many new slogans have emerged. Among them, many are born from practical experience, and although no one has ever shouted them out, they are precious precepts widely followed among the soldiers. For example, "Hidden illness is not illness" is one of them. Soldiers who are slightly accustomed to life on the southern front no longer feel the pain of hidden illnesses. According to reports from our side, the rate of hidden illnesses among frontline soldiers is 3% for the army and 2% for the navy. However, like reporting war news, this is an inaccurate report like those from the United States, and the actual rate is three to five times higher than this percentage. In our ranks, there is no practice of quickly withdrawing soldiers suffering from these illnesses from the front lines to the rear for deliberate recuperation. One reason is that we have an abundance of quinine cream, which is not allowed. One soldier once told me: "This is the fifth time I've had malaria." Examples of malaria patients not retreating from the front lines, fighting with a fever of 40 degrees Celsius, are not rare news. In the Suda area, a certain petty officer second class of the Marine Corps suddenly suffered a severe attack of malaria while on watch. At the same time, the telephone lines between the observation post and the unit headquarters were cut off by enemy fire. Therefore, this petty officer second class, suffering from a hidden illness, had to walk four kilometers every day to report to the unit headquarters.</p>
<p>On an anti-aircraft position, a non-commissioned officer in charge of shooting said: "The machine guns and anti-aircraft guns that are attacking enemy planes will never be hit by enemy fire. Because our side's spirit overwhelms the enemy plane's gunners. If the spirit fails, then you will be killed." These words are probably born from long practical experience. The spirit of the frontline soldiers, determined not to be hit by enemy fire, is truly admirable. This spirit can be said to be invincible. However, the nature of modern warfare is such that, even with this spirit, one cannot necessarily make the enemy surrender by relying solely on it. To put it more clearly, in addition to spirit, sufficient munitions are also needed. The amount of iron has a great significance in determining the outcome of a battle. Looking back at the tragic battle situations of Renteba, Monta, and others, the Japanese army did not fail in each battle. However, despite this, they still had to temporarily abandon their occupied positions. The reason for this is, in short, the lack of iron.</p>
<p>On the battlefield of Monta, which was in fierce fighting, a certain commander said: "War is sound!" This sentence accurately expresses the characteristics of modern warfare. The roar of airplanes, the screeching of battles, the roar of guns and bombs, the explosion of torpedoes, the sound of loudspeakers blaring towards the enemy positions—the place where many sounds intermingle is the battlefield of modern warfare. And the sound sources of these sounds can be divided into enemy and ally. By comparing the intensity of the sounds emitted from both sides' positions, one can gauge which side's battle is advantageous.</p>
<p>Today, good news is still frequently coming from the battle lines, but it is impossible to say "Even with few weapons, we can still win." The reason why we repeatedly have such victory records today is that the spirit of the Japanese soldiers compensates for the shortage of munitions. In the future, in addition to this valuable spirit, sending large quantities of weapons such as aircraft to the front lines is the only way to make the Japanese army's inevitable victory complete. There is no second way to achieve complete victory. (Naval Reporting Team Member Mori Masataka) (Translated from the December 16th weekly Mainichi)</p>

<h3>N's Pilot's Eyes</h3>
<p>During a break in the fierce fighting, a young naval warrior pilot showed me a directory. Pointing to a commemorative photo of his classmates: "This person is dead; this person is also gone. This person is still alive. As for this..." I looked down at the ground where the finger pointed, and unconsciously lowered my head.</p>
<p>The eyes of Petty Officer First Class N gleamed: "Artist, we will live until we completely conquer Australia!"</p>
<p>Here I see the infinite fighting spirit of the naval air corps. Relying on their vast productive capacity, the enemies have fought and lost, and fought again. Sometimes, there is not even anyone around.</p>
<p>In the dark officer's room of the Ampong 〇〇 base, the night's squad leader, with his hands clenched, seemed to spit blood: "It's tough now, there aren't enough planes." There was no need to hear the rest of the words. While glancing at the dark sky, I cursed: Beast! It's over now! Fireflies sparkled among countless trees, and the grave too glowed in the darkness! (Written by Kato Eizo) (Based on the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>WEDDING GOWN</h3>
<p>— Ren Shufang</p>
<p>The month of March is full of spring, and the scenery in the garden is so charming that even the water in the pond is stirred by the weeping willows. Meifen leaned against the garden gate, realizing that this was the thirtieth spring since her birth. Thinking of this, she was obviously a little sad. She felt she had received a hint that youth had bid her farewell, and the shadow of aging was gnawing at her heart day by day. She dared not think about what the future would be like!</p>
<p>This day was Meifen's birthday, and her two younger sisters, Lanfen and Jufen, had been clamoring to celebrate her birthday, but their good intentions aroused her worries. She vaguely remembered that on her twentieth birthday, her mother had stroked her shoulder and said, "Mei'er, this is the last whole birthday you'll have at home. By the time you're thirty, your husband should be celebrating your birthday for you."</p>
<p>At that time, Meifen lowered her head shyly. She certainly believed that in another ten years, she would definitely have children. But ten years passed in the blink of an eye, and she was still at home. These things pricked her heart like needles. She wanted to cry heartily, but she had to personally light the incense and candles, and personally go to the kitchen to cook. When she knelt down and kowtowed to her parents, she felt that if she didn't try her best to hold back, the tears would flow out. A layer of melancholy was also added to her mother's face.</p>
<p>In the Fang mansion, Miss Meifen was the most capable one. Apart from not understanding English and science, her Chinese foundation was quite good, and she could write a beautiful "Lingfei Sutra" script and classical Chinese. She was skilled in housework, whether it was cooking or sewing. In particular, embroidery was Miss Fang's forte. Mrs. Fang was getting old, and her daughter was so capable, so the affairs of the Fang mansion were all managed by Miss Meifen.</p>
<p>Like her elder sister, Second Miss Lanfen had not received a school education, and she was not as clever as Meifen. However, her good nature was well-known in the Fang mansion. As for Third Miss Jufen, partly because she was younger and partly because she had a very stubborn personality, she was the only one among the three girls who had managed to receive a new education. She was now in high school, and her grades were not bad. She was also extremely clever, but she was not very willing to give in to others.</p>
<p>In recent years, what had made Mrs. Fang and Mr. Fang worry day and night was the marriage of their three daughters. She had no sons, and her only hope was to get two good sons-in-law. Although Jufen was only twenty years old, Meifen was already thirty, and Lanfen was also twenty-seven. Over the years, there had been many people who came to propose marriage to these two ladies, but Mrs. Fang and Mr. Fang either disliked the proposer for being poor or for having too many family members, and they insisted that their daughters must marry a first wife. So, the days passed by, and the marriage of their daughters was inadvertently delayed. Now that she saw her daughters' ages were not young, she was really anxious.</p>
<p>In the autumn, Mr. Jiang, a friend of Mr. Fang, came personally to propose marriage for his nephew. His nephew had died a year ago, and he was now preparing to marry a second wife. The deceased wife had left behind two children. The Jiang family was also a prominent family, and everything was very familiar. In the past, Mr. Fang would have flatly refused. The Fang family's daughters would only marry a first wife. But now he readily agreed and even took photos of the two ladies for the Jiang family to choose from.</p>
<p>This matter was of no interest to Jufen, but it had a great impact on Meifen and Lanfen. Especially Meifen, she suffered insomnia all night, hoping that she would be chosen, and she felt that as the elder sister, she should get married before her younger sister. During the day, she often sat in a daze, and at night she could not sleep peacefully. She was obviously much more haggard.</p>
<p>A week later, Mr. Jiang sent a reply, saying that Lanfen, the second miss, had been chosen because young master Jiang was only thirty-two years old, so Miss Meifen's age seemed to be a bit too old. Although Mrs. Fang also hoped that Meifen would be chosen, but the matter was already settled. At least one daughter had found a home, so the two families decided to get engaged in the winter of that year and prepare to get married in the spring of the following year.</p>
<p>Lanfen had no objection to this matter. Everything was decided by her mother. But Meifen not only felt disappointed but also felt greatly humiliated. She cried all night and was afraid that her younger sister and the servants would laugh at her. During the day, she forced herself to be happy, but tears always welled up when she was reading. After the engagement ceremony was held, the Fang mansion gradually became busy. Because of her age, Mrs. Fang could not exert herself too much, so she entrusted all the matters of purchasing the dowry to Meifen. However, Meifen was heartbroken by every item, but on the surface, she had to pretend to be happy. After the New Year, it was soon spring, and Lanfen's wedding date had been set. Everyone was beaming with joy.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Meifen was sitting in her room when Lanfen suddenly pushed open the door and came in, sitting next to Meifen, lowering her head as if she had something to say. Originally, the sisters had a very good relationship, but because of this marriage, Meifen felt an unspeakable resentment towards Lanfen, but on the surface, she had never revealed it.</p>
<p>"Second Sister! Is there anything you need?" Meifen waited for a while, but Lanfen still didn't open her mouth, and Meifen became a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Elder Sister: I... I want to ask you for something."</p>
<p>"Can you stop beating around the bush! What is it? Tell me quickly."</p>
<p>"I want to ask you to embroider a dress for me, to wear after I take off the wedding dress."</p>
<p>"Why do you want me to make your clothes when you're getting married?" Meifen felt that her wound had been reopened.</p>
<p>"Good sister! You won't even agree to this little request I have? You're better at embroidery than me!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Good sister, please agree to it! I'll definitely thank you properly!"</p>
<p>"Alright!" Meifen swallowed her tears and finally agreed.</p>
<p>After a month of hard work, the dress was completed. The light crimson soft satin was matched with crimson peony flowers. The colors were so well-matched, and the embroidery was so exquisite that everyone who saw it praised it endlessly.</p>
<p>Lanfen got married. On the wedding day, she wore the embroidered dress, and the guests' praises were constantly sent to Miss Meifen, but she didn't feel any joy.</p>
<p>Time flowed by mercilessly like water. After Lanfen got married, Meifen became even more lonely. Jufen had schoolwork and was often not at home. Apart from lingering in the garden for a while, she spent the whole day moping in her room.</p>
<p>Jufen graduated this year. Along with the happy news of her graduation, Jufen proposed to her parents the idea of marrying a young English teacher she had met.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fang naturally agreed to this marriage that did not worry her at all, but under the strict questioning of the Fang Old Master, she learned that this future son-in-law was an orphan and had nothing except his own brain and hands. Moreover, he was from the distant north. These things immediately aroused the opposition of the Fang Old Master, who felt that a young lady from a prominent family like theirs could never marry a poor teacher with a humble background. Mrs. Fang was also reluctant to send her daughter to such a faraway place.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the father-daughter conflict began. The matter reached Meifen's ears, and she immediately rushed over. The Fang Old Master was already blue in the face.</p>
<p>"Father! Marriage is related to a person's lifelong happiness. The most important thing is that both parties have feelings. We are still young, and money can be earned with our hands and brains. As for social status, there's even less to talk about. I'm marrying a person, not a family." Jufen said a great deal with confidence.</p>
<p>The Fang Old Master felt that his daughter's words were simply too rude, and he immediately stood up.</p>
<p>"Fine! Unless you marry on your own, I will never agree!" Saying this, he flicked his sleeves and went out.</p>
<p>After this father-daughter conflict, Meifen persuaded Jufen to go to her room. Jufen said excitedly, with tears flowing down her face.</p>
<p>"Elder sister? Father is so stubborn, I really can't stand it. Mother's thinking is also outdated. How could your marriage have been delayed until now, and how could Second Sister have become someone's second wife? All of this was caused by them. They didn't think that a person only has one youth, and once it's lost, it will never come back."</p>
<p>Jufen felt that her third sister's words spoke to her heart, and she and Jufen began to cry in each other's arms. However, she thought that unless she made the most extreme compromises regarding marriage, there was little hope for her in this life.</p>
<p>"Elder sister! I'm going to talk to Mom and Dad again. If they still don't agree, I'll leave."</p>
<p>"Leave! Third sister, don't think like that! I'll definitely help you speak to Father."</p>
<p>The next day, the two sisters mustered up their courage to go before the Fang Old Couple, but they still got the same result.</p>
<p>Jufen felt that things were pressing in on her. In this way, not only was her marriage hopeless, but also her and her lover's common dream of going to the countryside to start a school would be shattered. These things all needed to be resolved in the short summer vacation. She knew that hesitation and timidity would not be beneficial to her future. Finally, as the summer vacation was about to end, she decided on the path she should take, which was... to leave.</p>
<p>Meifen sympathized with her third sister's plight and felt sorry for her own life. Now that her youth was being buried, she felt that she shouldn't let her younger sister go down the same path. So, she actually agreed to Jufen's departure and helped her leave.</p>
<p>On an early autumn night, Meifen was helping her pack her things when she suddenly thought of something and quickly walked out. When she came back, she was holding something in her hand.</p>
<p>"Third sister! Who knows when we'll see each other again after you leave. This is a piece of clothing that I embroidered myself, and it's my most satisfying work. I was going to wear it when I got married, but now I don't want to get married anymore. I'll give this dress to you as a memento: and I hope you'll wear it on your wedding day." "Everything about my departure depends on your help. I will definitely do as you say, but Mom and Dad..."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll take care of them. I'll take care of everything in this family." Jufen looked at the magnificent dress, black satin embroidered with red phoenixes inlaid with gold thread, with tears in her eyes and was too grateful to speak.</p>
<p>In the morning, before it was fully light, Jufen left. Meifen felt a layer of joy added to her heart. Although she still had to live a half-life of monastic life, she thought about her own frequent dizziness, heart palpitations, and stomach pains, and knew that she wouldn't be a fossil for long.</p>
<h3>WINTER SONG</h3>
<p>— Shizhou</p>
<p>The biting cold wind,</p>
<p>Freezes the accumulated water on the roadside.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the street,</p>
<p>All show shrinking expressions.</p>
<p>At this time:</p>
<p>In a store displaying new winter clothing,</p>
<p>Two modern women walked out.</p>
<p>One is:</p>
<p>A charming face accompanied by a fox fur scarf.</p>
<p>One is:</p>
<p>A body full of snow-white fluff lined with bright red lips.</p>
<p>They are talking vigorously.</p>
<p>Just turning the corner, not a few steps, suddenly "ah!" A sound, and quickly walked down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mom! Scared to death," it turned out at the foot of the wall under a broken reed mat,</p>
<p>There were two frozen human feet sticking out. A rag picking child was shivering from the cold in the street,</p>
<p>Although his mother put him in an old long coat.</p>
<p>The lower body only has a pair of pants,</p>
<p>Bare feet dragged a pair of broken and big shoes.</p>
<p>The cold wind blowing up was terrible. Go home,</p>
<p>And will be scolded by his mother. I had to endure the cold step by step.</p>
<p>An overnight west wind, had already blown leaves all over the street.</p>
<p>A pair of red lotus root like hands, climb them one by one.</p>
<p>"The red rice porridge picked up yesterday couldn't be heated,</p>
<p>So many picked up today my mother must be very happy."</p>
<p>He was thinking:</p>
<p>A trace of pleasant smile unwittingly revealing on his frozen red face.</p>
<h3>DO NOT LET THE PAST BECOME THE PAST</h3>
<p>— Cai Yanyan</p>
<p>Friend, don't linger on the past, it seems like a mysterious maze, even the ordinary becomes joy. If you are intoxicated in memories all day,</p>
<p>Even if it makes you disillusioned and depressed, there will never be a bright goodbye. Let's throw away these old things, it makes us hide in the corners of reality.</p>
<p>Blindly facing the current horrifying waves and winds.</p>
<p>The sorrow of longing is a waste. We can't keep every bubble,</p>
<p>Vainly floating like a pile of dregs.</p>
<p>Friend, please put away your sentimental intestines,</p>
<p>Time will still disappoint you even if it is a heavy turn. Why force yourself with the past, a beautiful vision is right in front of you.</p>
<p>Let's step on difficulties step by step.</p>
<p>Bravely strive for future freedom.</p>

<h3>WHAT CAN MAKE MUSCLES DEVELOP? INTRODUCING LIU KEZHONG'S SIMPLE EXERCISE METHOD</h3>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Zhao Zhuguang, is the president of the Shanghai Fitness Academy and the organizer of Jianlimei Magazine. In recent years, Mr. Zhao has spared no effort in promoting physical exercise and has cultivated many talents. His translations and writings include "Muscle Development Method," "Complete Book of Physical Exercise Methods," "Latest Dumbbell Exercise Method," and more than 20 other kinds. Therefore, we specially invite Mr. Zhao to introduce the methods of muscle development to the readers. ——Editor</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is an undeniable fact that the physical fitness of Chinese people is below standard. Therefore, for the sake of our own happiness and the future of our nation, we must catch up quickly and speed up the process of building our bodies to be strong.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, physical exercise should include exercise, rest, and nutrition. Regarding the first point, it would naturally be better if you could train under the guidance of an expert. Otherwise, you can get considerable results if you follow an appropriate method of exercise. But exercise must be persistent. If you only do it for a day or two a week and then hope to have amazing results, and then measure yourself with a tape measure and do not get the expected results, and then blame a certain exercise method for being bad, that is an unreasonable thing. Because the exercise to develop muscles is not a magic trick, it cannot make the muscles of the body grow larger at that time or the next day, but it takes time for the body's elements to slowly increase.</p>
<p>Rest is also an important part of physical exercise. The most important of these is sleep. Because during sleep, the cells that are destroyed by activity during the day have a chance to regenerate. Rest is divided into physical and mental aspects. If we think that we don't need to have a rational life just because we are exercising our bodies, then we will not get much benefit.</p>
<p>At present, nutrition is fundamentally a difficult problem. However, if our environment is superior, it is naturally best to eat eggs, milk, and lean meats and vegetables. But if our environment is normal, we can get our fat and protein from beans, especially soybeans. Get the minerals and vitamins our body needs from vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the physical weakness and economic conditions of most members of society, the movements we introduce this time do not require equipment. These exercises are also known as self-resistance or self-resistance exercises.</p>
<p>Exercise one</p>
<p>Stand with your feet comfortably apart, relax your whole body, and slowly raise your arms upward, while deeply inhaling. At this time, the abdomen should expand outward. When you have inhaled as much as you can, pause for a moment (but do not pause for too long, keep it comfortable), bend your body down: while exhaling, and cross your arms in front of your chest to compress your chest, so as to drive out as much air as possible from the lungs. At this time, the abdomen should contract inward. You can start with six times and gradually increase to twelve times.</p>
<p>Exercise two</p>
<p>Stand upright as before, with your hands on your hips, first turn your body to the left side, and when you turn as far as you can to the left, restore to the original position; then turn to the right side. Inhale each time you turn to one side, and exhale when you return to the original position. Throughout the entire movement, the legs should maintain a straight posture.</p>
<p>At first, you can do six times on each side, for a total of twenty times. This is an exercise to train the muscles on both sides of the abdomen.</p>
<p>Exercise three</p>
<p>Lie on your back on the ground, with your arms straight beside you, pressed on the ground. Keep your upper body still, stretch your legs and raise them upward while inhaling. When your legs are at a 90-degree angle to your body, pause for a moment, lower them and repeat. When your legs are raised upwards and are paused, you can raise your head and neck at the same time, so that the neck can also get a full range of motion. Exhale when you lower your legs.</p>
<p>When doing this exercise, one thing to pay attention to is that when raising your legs, your legs must be stretched (for older people or people with too much abdominal fat, the knees can be slightly bent, but try to straighten them afterwards). When returning to the original position, the whole body must be relaxed and not stiff. Do as much as you can, up to 25 times.</p>
<p>Exercise four</p>
<p>First stand with your feet comfortably apart, put your left hand on your right hand, and then slowly and forcefully bend your right arm upward from a straight position, while your left hand also applies considerable resistance. When it bends to the same height as your shoulder, restore and repeat. Inhale when bending upwards, and exhale when restoring. You can do ten to fifteen times. Both arms must do the same number of times. This is a very good exercise for the biceps (i.e., the front part of the upper arm).</p>
<p>Exercise five</p>
<p>First place both hands on the ground and stretch both arms, the distance between the hands is approximately equal to the width between the shoulders, stretch the whole body straight, and use both hands and toes to support the weight of the whole body. Lower your legs and arms, while exhaling, and when your chest almost touches the bottom, slowly and forcefully push your arms upward, while inhaling, until your arms are fully straightened. This is a very good exercise for developing chest muscles, and it is also of great help for the development of the shoulders and triceps.</p>
<p>At first, do as much as you can. If you can do more than twenty times, you can change to doing it with your fists, or raise your feet to do it.</p>
<p>Exercise six</p>
<p>Stand with your feet comfortably apart, put your hands on your hips, and keep your body straight, then bend your knees and squat down, while exhaling. When you have squatted as low as you can, stand up, and lift your feet up at the same time, and try to contract the muscles of your thighs and calves as much as possible. Inhale deeply when standing up, and do about ten to eleven times. After you can exceed ten times, you can use one leg to support the weight of your whole body to do it, so that the muscles of the legs have a further movement.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned major exercises are expanded from the muscle development correspondence course attached to this hospital. If we can really do them seriously, we can see our whole body's muscles developing day by day. I wish you all readers can develop a strong body in the near future!</p>
<h3>West Qing Champion Hualian Pharmacy Team's Excellent Tactics – Commentary on Individual Skills</h3>
<p>The West Qing Basketball Invitational Tournament has been held for fourteen sessions. Except for the first session which was won by Shanghai University, the twelfth by Qiangju, and the thirteenth by Huaxing, the rest were won by foreign teams. At the beginning of this session's preparation, the Western team's giants were ambitious, while our Chinese teams placed their hopes on Zhongbei and Dongfang. However, Zhongbei withdrew, and Dongfang failed to be consistently energetic, while Hualian Pharmacy emerged as a dark horse, initially having the ambition to win. Relying on the concerted efforts of all, with everyone united as one, they maintained their winning streak, creating a glorious history. Their results were as follows:</p>
<p>Won against Sanlun 76-21</p>
<p>Won against Tongren 40-20</p>
<p>Won against Gengren 35-32</p>
<p>Won against Datong 49-25</p>
<p>Won against Dongfang 62-47</p>
<p>Won against Huanan 53-21</p>
<p>Won against Renyu 42-30</p>
<p>Won against Huaying (opponent) forfeited</p>
<p>Won against Shantou team 46-31</p>
<p>Won against Amateur (opponent) forfeited</p>
<p>Basketball tactics have progressed from five-man zone defense to man-to-man marking. Since the Washington team's visit, the progress has even advanced to using screens to break the man-to-man defense. Under the leadership of Zhang Zixiang, although Hualian Pharmacy did not demonstrate new tactics, they strived for success in the above aspects and seemed to have reached perfection. This is truly admirable. Now, let's introduce the team's brave generals:</p>
<p>Team Leader Zhang Zixiang – Graduated from Sino-French Medical University, a registered pharmacist known by this name. Mr. Zhang is a basketball star, previously representing the Yaoguang team. This time, the organization of Hualian Pharmacy was mainly driven by spirit. Winning the brilliant championship was unexpected. His inner joy is understandable.</p>
<p>Captain Kong Guangyi – A veteran of the basketball scene, he made a name for himself ten years ago representing Qingguang. Even now, his skills are still sharp. He doesn't protect the younger players. Serving as captain and directing the team on the field, his contribution is significant.</p>
<p>Guard Qu Xilin – Also a veteran of basketball, he has a clever and quick mind. He is unusually calm during matches, with excellent skills and accurate shooting. He is like one man guarding the pass, impossible for ten thousand to surpass. Mr. Qu previously worked at the Central Savings Society, winning the championship. Especially in the West Qing tournament, he defeated the giant Monarque twice. It's impossible to add more, so let's note this down first.</p>
<p>Center Wu Chengzhang – Nicknamed Adi, indicating his young age. Before the season, he was still in the second-tier team. However, he suddenly joined the first tier this time and performed very well, truly a rising star. His rebounding and speed under the basket resemble the famous Chen Xue, with some saying he has surpassed him, which is credible!</p>
<p>Right Forward Zhang Lanlun – Physically strong, he is a typical basketball forward. He relies on his stamina and excels at reading opponents. He can run unpredictably, making it difficult for the enemy to defend against him. This is his special characteristic.</p>
<p>Left Forward Zhang Xiaoxuan – He is a disciple of the Qian style, with a slightly upscale style. His specialty is intercepting the ball halfway and shooting from the left corner, with a near-certain success rate of nine out of ten, which is commendable.</p>
<p>All-Around Zhang Liangxiong – Mr. Zhang is proficient in both guard and forward positions. He previously played for the Liangxi team and was already loved by many. He has been retired for a long time. Now, he's back and has contributed significantly to Hualian Pharmacy. His unique advantage is that in extremely chaotic situations, he can prevent unexpected shots and often create miracles, with the ability to turn the tide.</p>
<p>The introduction is complete. We hope that Hualian Pharmacy will not be satisfied with this and will further improve their standards and evolve their skills, making basketball even better and creating greater achievements. We sincerely offer our blessings. (Reporter Shou)</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Basketball Refereeing (Mei Bixian) – Reflections on an Assault on a Referee in West Qing</h3>
<p>In the past, incidents of assaulting referees occurred frequently, even in serious National Games events, which was regrettable! However, recently, such incidents seem rare in Shanghai competitions. This is a welcome sign of progress in sportsmanship and ethics. Unfortunately, an incident was witnessed again at the West Qing stadium last week, which raises some concerns.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Basketball Refereeing</p>
<p>Among all ball games, I believe basketball refereeing is the most difficult. Soccer has a slower pace, and the most important things to watch are offsides and free kicks. Moreover, there are often linesmen on both sides. Volleyball has very few difficult rules to call, except for touching the net and double touches. Only basketball, because of its fast pace and many strict rules, makes basketball refereeing the most difficult in my opinion. Now, I dare to offer my humble opinions to various sectors. In addition to the usual conditions, I dare to say that the basketball referee should have the following points worth discussing:</p>
<p>Solemn Attitude</p>
<p>Some say that basketball referees should be approachable, but I disagree. Basketball referees must be solemn, representing sacred inviolability. Especially during breaks, they should not talk much with the players to reduce the effect of emotions, which can grow invisibly. Furthermore, whether in extremely tense or extremely relaxed games, they should always maintain that solemnity. Otherwise, smiling and laughing in unimportant games will reduce the players' respect. Therefore, a basketball referee should not be approachable, but solemn.</p>
<p>Whistle Techniques</p>
<p>Generally, it is thought that the more whistles, the better, but that's not true. A whistle is a reflection of the occurrence of a fact, not the result of a fact. Therefore, I think it is redundant to blow the whistle madly when a ball is scored. Too many whistles increase the players' and spectators' annoyance. Therefore, unnecessary whistles should be minimized. Secondly, the whistle sounds should be different. For example, a foul should be slightly longer and louder, while an out-of-bounds call can be light and short to indicate the seriousness of the situation. When a player mistakenly continues to dribble the ball, a broken, intermittent whistle should be used. A whistle like the one used for a false start in track and field may mislead the players and waste valuable seconds of the game.</p>
<p>Psychological Effect</p>
<p>Many referees experience a psychological change when they encounter famous players, following the player's various suggestive attitudes and making it their target. This is absolutely wrong. Because the referee is the highest authority, they must adhere to their original intentions. If they are afraid of something, they will inevitably make one mistake after another. Psychologically, they must not have any concerns.</p>
<p>Other things to consider include minimizing unnecessary socializing with players. Referees should regularly practice and study together so that every referee can become the most standard and impartial person, giving players and spectators the best impression.</p>
<p>There is a referees' association in this city, and there is a lot of communication, but it mainly focuses on friendship. I think the emphasis should be on discussion because nothing is ever finished. In particular, they should do more practical exercises, which will lead to considerable success. Furthermore, I hope that referees can be fair and that research articles can be published in newspapers regularly so that players and spectators can understand the points of misunderstanding, which will naturally reduce assaults.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special City Food Bureau Announcement</h3>
<p>Hu Liang Pei Yi Zi No. 468. This Bureau's 32nd allocation of public rice is two and a half liters of complete white japonica rice per person. It was originally scheduled to be sold sequentially, but in consideration of the Lunar New Year and to celebrate the festival with the people, the 32nd allocation was swapped with the 31st allocation to be issued in advance. This was submitted to the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee for discussion and approval and implemented accordingly. As a result, citizens received a ration of rice of excellent quality during the Spring Festival, which was gratifying. Now, to replenish the rice allocated for the 31st allocation, it is specially scheduled to be issued from February 6th to 10th. Citizens in each district can purchase two liters of rice per person with this Bureau's 31st rice purchase certificate at the designated public granary within the deadline, at a cost of eight yuan per liter, totaling sixteen yuan. Expired rice purchase certificates will be void and will not be reissued. In addition to ordering all public granaries to comply, this announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge. February 5th, Year 33 of the Republic of China. Director Ji Hua.</p>
