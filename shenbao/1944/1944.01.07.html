<h3>一念之善！</h3>
<p>一昨爲助學金向讀者呼籲，希望諸君以一念之善，爲社會國家助成百年大計，意猶未盡，特再掬誠以吿各界。</p>
<p>助學金運動，自新聞報及本報等創辦以來，雖僅數屆，但實際上收到的成效，可向讀者報吿的：第一，是接受助學金的靑年人數，已極可觀。僅以本報上屆而言，已達四千以上，換一句話說，即是在上學期內，已有四千名以上的清寒優秀的靑年；因為社會上熱心人士的慷慨解囊而得以進學或繼成其學業。</p>
<p>第二，是接受助學金諸青少年，依據我們歷届調查，大體上可得如下的結論，即：　確係貧困無力升學而具有高尙志願者，其間有一部份，且是若于難童收容機關之苦兒孤兒，亦有一部份在另有受助辦法時，先後自動請求退回助金，可見木報助舉金，大體上極無分文虛糜。　據各學校報告及個別調查，接受助學金諸學生，幾乎全部爲學問品行均屬優越之靑少年，爲敎師及同學所敬愛。此尤爲捐助者所樂聞的。</p>
<p>第三，舉辦助學金運動以來，社會人士始終熱烈響應。如上屆預定目標為一百萬元，而實際成績達一百三十餘萬元之鉅。一方面有社會各界熱心人士慷慨捐助，正可說「地無分東西南北，人無分男女老幼」無不熱烈參加，而且，另一方面，有許多本身並非富裕而以一年之善，粉粉出力，如若幹劇團諸君之義演助學等，其精神同樣值得欽佩。</p>
<p>過去的成效，鼓勵我們决心繼續這一最有積極意義的社會服務事業。也使我們對於本屆助學金運動發生更大的期待。不過，本屆比上屆問題嚴重了，因爲，第一，一般物價，比上屆當時增漲又達數倍，貧寒之家的子女，就學的能力更加降低了　也就是說，社會上又將平添一大羣失學的青少年！第二，出於物價之高漲，學業的支付自然不能不隨之增加，原來勉强在就學中的靑少年，今年一定有一大批不得不開始被屏斥於學校的大門外了！第三，上學期接受本報助學金的四千餘名學生，本學期如不替他們慕到足够的學費，就有失學的危險了！由此可知，當前的問題，一方面是失學靑少年勢將增加，另一方面，則是助學金數額有隨物價而增加的必要，總括來說，就是本屆助學金，需要比上屆更多的金額。</p>
<p>本屆助學額，以上述種原因，暫定爲三百萬元。我們不厭重複地希望工商企業界股東會董事會諸君子，在盈餘項下提出一小部分捐充助學金，我們更希望各界在春節宴聚餽贈費用中提出一小部分捐充助學金。我們深信，這是超出一切的最有意義的善舉！我們竭誠希望各界人士以一念之善，助成此百年大計，爭先恐後，以完成本學期助學金運動。我們已特爲諸君預留着最光榮的題名篇幅！</p>
<h3>拉巴爾加比恩格日海空部隊戰果　大本營發表擊落大批敵機</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日下午三時發炎：　帝國海軍航空部隊於一月三日晨邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機約卅架，擊落其十一架（內四架未證實），我機兩架未返。　帝國驅逐艦隊及海軍航空部隊，一月四日晨邀擊來襲加比恩格之敵機七十六架，擊落其十二架，我方除驅逐艦一艘受輕傷外，其他毫無損害。　帝國海軍航空部隊一月四日上午邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵戰鬥機二十二架，擊落其十八架（內一架未證實），我機三架未返基地。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大本營六日發表三·四兩日，拉巴爾及加比恩格方面凄烈之敵機邀激戰戰果，茲誌日海軍機隊與驅逐艦隊擊落大批敵機，詳情如次：　拉巴爾方面美軍於三日晨以波特西奇斯基F4a型機，巨人F6F型戰鬥機共約三十架，來襲拉巴爾,日海軍戰鬥機常即　空迎擎，擊落其F4a型機十架，F6F型機一架，共十一架。美軍復於四日上午以F4a型機F6FF型戰鬥機共二十二架，反復轟炸拉巴爾，日海軍戰鬥機隊當即凌空邀擊，擊落其F4a型機十六架，F6FF型二架，共十八架。而充分發揮日海軍機所向無敵之精神，三日日方損失飛機兩架，四日則損失三架，共損失三架，　加比恩格方面美軍，四日晨以陶格拉斯LBF型轟炸兼雷擊機約四十架，丹陀列斯TBD俯衝轟炸機約十六架，巨人F6F戰鬥機約二十架，共約七十六架來襲新愛爾蘭島加比恩格方面，其時，適有日驅逐艦隊於新愛爾蘭島與新漢諾威島間之斯即英海峽擔任哨戒，於是乃在日海軍戰鬥機隊緊密協力下，加以邀擊，日驅逐艦隊以高射砲火擊落其十一架，日海軍機擊落其一架，共十二架。至空戰戰果微低原因乃因日海軍機隊斯日不出動轟炸敵軍陣地及敵部隊，故加比恩格方面基地僅有少數機守衛，是役日方除驅逐艦一艘稍受輕傷外，並無損失，且受傷之驅逐艦，航行極爲自如。通過設治理運河籌備處</p>

<h3>渝方官史　吞沒救濟金</h3>
<p>萆勘剜六日中央社電　渝第六載區司令孫連仲軍首腦部及湘省政府於今次常德作戰，被日軍擊破，故對民衆威信掃地。現爲謀挽回計，乃早請重慶撥發三千萬元，作爲復興救濟資金，同時并大事宣傳，將救濟一般民衆，但重慶所發出之款項，僅爲二百萬元，尙不足請求額之一成。但此二百萬元中，有一百萬元已被省政府及軍界飽其私囊、其餘之五十萬，則被縣長私吞，二十五萬元則被保長等私吞，實際作爲救濟資金者，僅不過二十五萬元。渝軍首腦及官吏之貪汚，實令人爲之驚異。彼等事前大事宣傳救濟民衆，事後竟演出吞沒公款之醜態，故民衆對其無不怨聲載道，同時一般民心離反，益爲濃厚。</p>

<h3>冬季攻勢達頂點西鳥克蘭惡戰中　聶伯套德軍防禦戰獲捷</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據海通社訊；蘇軍冬季攻勢，現正在全力進行中，幷巳在多處地叚獲得初期勝利，尤其是齊托米爾方面，但蘇軍仍取舊戰略，時時轉移其進攻重心，敵軍似不擬向主要進攻據點實施突破行動，除克里契夫西南遭遇猛攻外，近將有兩處地點開始形成激戰區域。蘇軍堅强部隊，現源源自寇許開出，在公路一帶集中，克里米亞之門戶貝萊科普地峽及契爾喀賽區，亦有蘇軍集中，此次蘇軍冬季攻勞，幷無「俄羅斯冬季」之氣象，夜間雖降霜，但在白天即融解。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據海通社通訊員，塞托留斯上尉報吿稱：蘇軍在尼維爾以北之進攻，仍未可視爲大戰焦點已轉移至該區。在維特勃斯克之局勢，星期二尙無變動，蘇步兵數師由大隊坦兄車掩護，向波洛伊斯克以西進攻，敵人此種行動，在戰略上之價値，迄難得知。目下蘇軍在烏克蘭整個之西部，及波闌舊邊境之壓力，仍在猛烈進行，德軍新防綫故在伐吐丁軍團之北翼，紅軍已在奧里伏斯克及諾維格勒伏林斯克以西推進，貝迪契夫績有惡戰，德軍業由其東部撤退。</p>
<p>加薩丁之南，敵前鋒向布在洛河上游推進，已暫時被阻，敵軍現處於不利地位，因伐吐丁軍之左翼，尙洛後一百五十公里，猶在貝拉耶察爾柯夫之德軍陣地作戰，該處德軍當爲伐吐丁將軍南翼之威脅</p>
<p>現蘇軍當局，已準備由東西北三面攻擎，因此項準備之故，聶伯河灣之戰事，在過去數日問，稍爲鬆弛。在諾蓋斯草原，大隊敵軍之移動，亦在進行中，至於此項準備，是否爲擬在尾柯波爾及克森之問渡聶伯河，抑係將向克里米亞再進攻則不得而知。無論如何，敵軍在培里貝萊科普土股所集之大軍，其目的當爲進攻克里米亞無疑。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：過長時間之沉寂後，蘇軍突於日昨以大聶伯河套內强大之部隊及坦克車隊，攻於克里伏洛格之北及基洛伏格勒之東，企圖突破德軍陣地，德軍於激戰中及反攻時，或截擊敵軍或將其擊退，並於是役擊毀蘇軍坦克車一百四十九輛。德軍並於日昨在皮羅波斯克之西護得攻防戰之全勝，蘇軍猛攻無效。聶伯河以東之各橋頭堡仍盡在德軍掌握中。</p>
<h3>大西洋沿岸　德防務鞏固　登陸作戰必遭擊潰</h3>
<p>沮里克六日中央社電　反軸心陣營於莫斯科德黑蘭兩次會談後，似已决將展開歐陸進攻作戰，並於去歲十二月二十四日設立侵歐反軸心軍司令部，以英本土爲根據地，地中海方面反軸心軍司令部亦實行大改革，以鞏固攻歡洲之陣形，並宣傳一九四司年為決戰之年，力謀使一般認為第二戰綫之結成已迫眉睫。然自軍均政治兩方面檢討，結成第二戰綫之期實有無限之感，德軍當局亦知蘇軍繼續展開冬季攻勢之際，乃反軸心軍實現對歐進攻作戰之良機，然沮里克新聞報載倫敦電則根本否認冬季進攻作戰之可能性，略謂冬季海上氣候不合登陸作戰，不能依預訂計劃宣行，夜長霧濃，雖對作戰有利，然因陸上泥濘不堪，登陸後之作戰决不能順利展開。巴爾幹方面亦然云云。但反軸心軍，若拋棄此機會，而蘇軍實力有限，故今春將不能續作攻勢。德軍司令部於德黑蘭會談時，曾派遣羅美爾元帥巡視自北海至比斯開　之大西洋防衛綫，並積極改編歐洲沿海一帶之德防衛軍。據傳迭特爾大將所部軍團之一部，近已開抵法國，德軍司令部更於法北岸一帶增設多數自動砲陣地，並增派新銳戰鬥機及俯衝轟炸機約干架，大西洋防衛綫今後日臻强化。縱反軸心軍唯恐戰爭之長期化，不顧一切冒險登陸，亦必被德軍擊潰。</p>

<h3>美當局警告國民日軍力極為強大</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中社電　此次戰爭發生後，美政府對其國民即取隱瞞政策，僅發表虛僞之勝利戰報，據華盛頓來電，美海部人事局次長顛夫愛爾斯少將，最近曾播講警吿國民稱，日軍仍擁有龐大之人力與物力，自珍珠灣一役以來，美軍曾再三攻擊日軍，然日軍艦隊仍保特原有之實力。又美國戰時情報局四日夜曾發表聲明，驚戒美國國民，要旨如次：反軸心軍僅　回被德軍佔領地區　分之一，日軍佔領地區二十分之一，於太平洋方面距東京仍有三千英里之遙。又日軍之武力極爲强大，日軍佔領之地域，其廣大足與美國匹敵，美軍今後實行民攻，除以珍珠灣爲基地外別無他途。反之，日軍則以散布於太平洋上之各烏嶼從事防衛，而此等島蓋均築成堅固之海軍及空軍基地太平洋上雖曾屢次激戰，然美軍及反軸心軍終未能與日本陸海軍之主力接觸。日本將兵士氣之旺盛，乃周知之事實，日本毫未感人力不足，同時並可於佔領地內動員四億勞動者，而美軍不過僅進入日軍防衛綫之外廊而已，並未接觸日軍無論作任何犧牲亦須死守之陣地。</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　海通社訊：倫敦消息，吉爾柏羣島美國海軍陸戰隊司令又德森少將稱：在太平洋戰塲，美國尙須經過許多困苦之血戰，希望美國人民勿低估日人。</p>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　海通社訊：倫敦息，斯密斯昨在「每日郵報」著文稱：設日本得有充份之時間從容調整其戰果，則對日戰事决無戰勝之理，反軸心國不應坐失時間，致卞日本以增强之機會，因時間之因素有利於日本，有人以爲日本工業脆弱，在長時期內必趨失敗，此實屬危險之幻想，日本在戰事初期中所佔領之土地，已形成一偉大之帝國，若該國綱續佔有此項富源，則日本勢必日趨强盛，日本如能善用佔領區內之天然資源，則數年之後日本將爲世界第一强國。斯密斯旋要求反軸心國改變在太平洋中之戰略，蓋反軸心國佔若千島嶼與森林，不能減弱日本之地位，日本主力艦隊尙未出動，反軸心國如欲擎敗日本，當先消滅其海軍，故反軸心國當迫日本海軍接受海上之大戰。日本同時亦爲陸上之强國，反軸心國目前在陸上擎敗日本希望甚少，至於重慶則因缺乏兵器，無力發動總攻，故喧傳已久之緬甸攻勢，將成爲泡影矣。</p>
<h3>各交戰國的徵兵年齡</h3>
<p>以提高軍隊的戰力爲目的，日本此次把徵兵的年齡減低了一年，於是十九歲的朝氣蓬勃的靑年，都執戈效命疆塲。自從七年前的中國事變勃發以來，以至於此次的大戰爭中，日軍以其龐大而精銳無比的人的資源爲背景，和英美驚慌失措地把徵兵年齡減低至十八歲便驅之使上戰塲的情形對照起來，日本一直堅持二十歲的徵兵年齡，今際此大東亞戰爭第三年的决勝年，把七年問積　蓄起來的豐裕的人的資源，集中在决戰上，英國在二年前的一九四一年，美國在一年前的一九四二年，就已經把徵兵年齡擴充至十八歲，日本直到現在始漸將十九歲的靑年送上戰塲，兩相比較起來，可見日本之人的戰方的雄厚，在大陸及南海已佈置了磐石之安的戰略熊勢，同時，日本的潛力，亦於此闡明無餘。日本此次將十九歲的靑年送上戰塲，以應付業已筋疲力盡的敵國十八歲靑年所組成的軍隊，更鞏固了必勝的信念。茲將第二次世界大戰中各主耍交戰國的徵兵年齡比較如下</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>美國誇稱擁有一億三千萬人口的人的資源，但劇一九四二年的大總統爐邊談話，已減低至十八歲，自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，簡直在年齡上互相挑戰。</p>
<p>美國在大東亞戰爭勃發前一年的一九四〇年九月十六日，施行選擇徵兵法，因此而確立了現行兵役法的基礎。據該法，先登記自二十一歲至三十六歲的男子市民一千六百五十萬人一上，與以一年的軍事訓練。但大東亞戰爭勃發後，立即取消，把二十一歲減低三年爲十八歲，把三十六歲增加到六十五歲，在這年齡中的男子應負徵兵義務。但恐懼個人主義國與諭的羅斯福總統，除於一九四二年十月十二日以「爐邊談話」向國民呼籲外，更向國會提出，雖經衆議院通遇，卒遭（十月十七日）參議院的反對。</p>
<p>參院不顧總統與軍事常局的反對，以三十九票對三十一票通過下列修正案，「對滿十八歲及十九歲的壯丁，在派赴海外之先，應在美國境內施行一年以上的軍事訓練。於是在十一月十日的參衆兩院聯合會議上，由於政府方面的奔走，削除這修正案而暫吿妥協，至十三日，始在總統所提原案上簽名終了。同年十一月十八日，對滿十八歲至十九歲的合格年齡者，總統發出下列布吿，而確立了現行兵役法。</p>
<p>九四二年七月一日以後，足十八歲的男子市民，應自十二月十一日起至三十一日止，完畢兵籍登記。</p>
<p>一九四三年一月以後，足十八歲的男子市民，應在其誕生日登記。</p>
<p>但對學生，限於高等學校的學生，這徵兵年齡延期至學年完了並得自由徵集專修學校學生的大部分及高等學校學生的一部服兵役。但美國也感到了這徵兵年齡的減低，在生產力的勞働力上，有極大的影響。據戰時人的資源委員會長波爾。麥克納得發表，根據「奧斯金·華滋華斯案」（男子十八歲至六十五歲，女子十八歲至五十歲的强制登記及徵用案），本年徵用六千二百五十萬的人的資源，也因強硬反對而未見實施。所以這現行兵役在生產部門上是很有影響的。現在美國國內十八州制定得在軍需工廠雇用從滿十六歲至不滿十八歲的少年，其他七州亦在討論同樣的法案，勞働力間題頗有各地單獨解决的似向。本年十二月初旬發表的戰時情報局報吿書「開戰二年來的美國」上說，美國現在的勞働人口，包括服兵役者在內，爲六千三百六十萬人。（朱完）（翔：譯自十二月二十四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>以火柴燭皂而言</h3>
<p>新年以來，木市日用必須品價格，益早繼長增高之勢，而爲時適在農曆年關以前，其對於平民生活之威脅，可以不言而喻了。試以火柴燭皂而言，則知漲勢之烈，殊堪驚人，一三種日用品如是，千百種日用品亦復如是，漲風所趨，一切物價，無不因之「水長船高」，徒使物値與幣値背道而馳，愈離愈遠，由於物値漫無止境地向上，所以幣値也是漫無止境地向下，這是人民貶視幣値心理的濫觴，不但是統制當局所當積極取締，也是財政當局所當籌謀補救的。</p>
<p>自物資統制而言，日用品價格，一經實施配給以後，即成爲有漲無跌，變本加厲的局面，米·煤。糖，油·火柴·肥皂·以至捲菸，無一不是如此，其癥結所在，即爲配給制度之不能使人滿意，不能使人度其最低限度的生活，於是日用品的接濟，惟有仰給於黑市，旣爲黑市，物價即無標準可循了，今日漲一倍，明日可以漲十倍，誰去干涉？</p>
<p>結果，圖暴利者，日日從事於囤積，慮漲價者，亦日日從事於囤積，愈囤愈漲，愈漲愈囤，遂使物價上漲，漫無止境了。因此，制止物價漲風，以眼前而論，還是在於取締囤積，消滅黑市，否則物資配給，是要始終成爲「畫餅」的。現在統制當局已經認淸這一點了，所以物資調查委員會，業已開始飭將火柴·洋燭·肥皂三項物資之最近上海存量及產量分別查取，以杜隱匿虛報之弊。我們認爲這是圓滑一切物資配給的初步工作，亟應擴大推行的。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>立志（一）</p>
<p>到了署假，學生們都很踴躍地，在天保山海演，和與次郞海濱，開始游冰了。</p>
<p>眞人，也到海邊去了，但是，只好嘔着氣，咬着下嘴唇，躺在沙灘上。他雖然游得不高明，但是俯泳，是不成問題的，只因爲沒有母親的允許，不能進入水裏去。只能脫光了有服，從早晨就晒着脊背以解愁悶。</p>
<p>「諸君，在放假期　，都要　成黑人才行。我最不喜歡白臉蛋的東西。在新學期開始的時候，耍作一回黑人比賽，諸君，在這比賽中都不要輸了才好。」這是菊地少佐，在最後的上課時間，用純粹的熊本方言，發表的訓話。眞人胸中的不服輸的心理，越發激起他那晒背的决心。那原因，就是自己深知道是一個「白臉蛋的東西」。</p>
<p>隆夫，起初也陪同他晒背，熱度過高的時候，他就要潛進透明的碧波裏去。只有眞人獨個兒，忍耐着頭暈，晒背，哂胸，好像烤肉似的反轉着。</p>
<p>（從前不知道中原猶介先生，是那樣偉大的人物！）</p>
<p>校長講話的感動，又在他的胸中甦生起來了。據校畏的話，說是用學理實騐電氣的，是平賀源內，和佐久間象山，而應用到軍事上的是中原猶介。猶介雖然應用油紙隔歸霸氣，那樣原始的方法，然而他終究造成了亞鉛，銅板，稀硫酸的電池，以此電流使機電和地　爆發的試騐成功了。他研究的科學，對於民生福利如製造玻璃，也是以軍艦窗使用的厚玻璃爲第一。採用有碳酸作消毒　，也是爲傷　軍人準</p>
<p>（我也作科學家吧？……）</p>
<p>嗅着火燒似的熱砂，眞人昏迷的做着自己將來的　。據通知書上寫的成績，數學和語學近一百分，所以這種希望，並不是沒有道理的。尤其是在同級裏，第一個發見了那碑的存在，似乎效倣中原鐵心齊命中註定的。</p>
<p>一瞬間，他的希望，被推到千　的深谷中去了。長姊春子，巳締結了姻緣，店裏的買賣近來也興隆起來了，但是他家的經濟情形，不容易能擔保他從高等學下到大學的學生生活。</p>
<p>（從中學畢業，就去當銀行職員嗎？……）</p>
<p>他用無聊而着淚的眼睛遠　着海邊小島的影子，</p>

        <h1>1944.01.07</h1>
<h3>A Moment of Kindness!</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I appealed to readers for educational assistance funds, hoping that everyone would contribute a moment of kindness to help the society and the nation achieve a century-long plan. Feeling that my intentions were not fully expressed, I sincerely appeal to all sectors again.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the educational assistance fund movement by Xinwen Bao and this newspaper, it has only been a few sessions, but the actual results that can be reported to readers are: first, the number of young people receiving educational assistance funds is already quite considerable. Taking the last session of this newspaper as an example, it has reached more than four thousand. In other words, during the last semester, more than four thousand outstanding young people from poor families were able to enter school or continue their studies because of the generosity of enthusiastic people in society.</p>
<p>Second, according to our past investigations, the following conclusions can be drawn about the young people who receive educational assistance funds: They are indeed poor and unable to go to school but have noble aspirations. Among them, some are orphans and children from difficult children's shelters, and some have voluntarily requested to return the funds when there are other ways to receive assistance. It can be seen that the educational assistance fund is generally not wasted in any way. According to reports from various schools and individual investigations, almost all students who receive educational assistance funds are outstanding young people in terms of academic performance and character, and are respected by teachers and classmates. This is especially pleasing to donors.</p>
<p>Third, since the launch of the educational assistance fund movement, people from all walks of life have always responded enthusiastically. For example, the target for the last session was one million yuan, but the actual result reached more than 1.3 million yuan. On the one hand, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have generously donated, which can be described as "regardless of east, west, north, and south, regardless of men, women, old, and young," all enthusiastically participating. Moreover, on the other hand, many people who are not wealthy themselves have contributed their efforts with a year of kindness, such as the charity performances of several theater groups. Their spirit is equally admirable.</p>
<p>The past achievements encourage us to continue this most meaningful social service undertaking. It also makes us have greater expectations for this year's educational assistance fund movement. However, this year's problem is more serious than last year's, because, first, the general price level has increased several times compared to last year, and the ability of children from poor families to go to school has further decreased. In other words, a large group of out-of-school young people will be added to society! Second, due to the high prices, the cost of education will inevitably increase. A large number of young people who were barely in school this year will inevitably be excluded from the gates of the school! Third, if we do not raise enough tuition fees for the more than four thousand students who received educational assistance funds from this newspaper last semester, they will be in danger of dropping out of school! It can be seen that the current problem is that, on the one hand, the number of out-of-school young people will increase, and on the other hand, the amount of educational assistance funds needs to increase with prices. In short, this year's educational assistance fund needs more money than last year's.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the amount of educational assistance fund for this year is tentatively set at three million yuan. We tirelessly hope that the gentlemen of the board of directors of industrial and commercial enterprises will set aside a small portion of their surplus to donate to the educational assistance fund. We also hope that people from all walks of life will set aside a small portion of their Spring Festival banquet and gift expenses to donate to the educational assistance fund. We firmly believe that this is the most meaningful act of kindness that goes beyond everything! We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will contribute a moment of kindness to help achieve this century-long plan, and strive to complete this semester's educational assistance fund movement. We have specially reserved the most glorious title page for you!</p>
<h3>Rabaul and Kavieng Air and Sea Battle Results: Imperial Headquarters Announces Downing of Large Numbers of Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 6th: On the morning of January 3rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted about 30 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 11 of them (4 of which were unconfirmed). Two of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial Destroyer Squadron and the Navy Air Force intercepted 76 enemy aircraft attacking Kavieng, shooting down 12 of them. Our side suffered no damage other than minor damage to one destroyer. On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted 22 enemy fighters attacking Rabaul, shooting down 18 of them (1 of which was unconfirmed). Three of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 6th the results of the fierce enemy aircraft interception battles in the Rabaul and Kavieng areas on the 3rd and 4th. The details of the Japanese naval air squadron and destroyer squadron shooting down large numbers of enemy aircraft are as follows: In the Rabaul area, the US military attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 3rd with about 30 aircraft, including Vought F4U Corsairs and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters. The Japanese naval fighters immediately took to the air to intercept them, shooting down 10 F4U Corsairs and 1 F6F Hellcat fighter, for a total of 11 aircraft. On the morning of the 4th, the US military again used a total of 22 F4U Corsairs and F6F Hellcat fighters to repeatedly bomb Rabaul. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them in the air, shooting down 16 F4U Corsairs and 2 F6F fighters, for a total of 18 aircraft. Fully demonstrating the invincible spirit of the Japanese naval aircraft, the Japanese side lost two aircraft on the 3rd and three aircraft on the 4th, for a total loss of three aircraft. In the Kavieng area, the US military attacked Kavieng on New Ireland Island on the morning of the 4th with about 40 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, about 16 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers, and about 20 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, for a total of about 76 aircraft. At that time, a Japanese destroyer squadron was on patrol in the Strait between New Ireland Island and New Hanover Island, so it was intercepted with the close cooperation of the Japanese naval fighter squadron. The Japanese destroyer squadron shot down 11 of them with anti-aircraft fire, and the Japanese naval aircraft shot down 1 of them, for a total of 12 aircraft. The reason why the air combat results were slightly lower was because the Japanese naval air squadron did not sortie to bomb enemy positions and enemy troops on that day, so only a few aircraft were guarding the Kavieng base. In this battle, the Japanese side suffered no losses except for slight damage to one destroyer, and the damaged destroyer was able to navigate very freely.</p>

<h3>Righteous Armies of Pingjin Pledge Allegiance to the Righteous Republican Government</h3>
<p>Beijing, 6th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Japanese side had previously allowed the Italian expatriates in North China to regain their freedom. Now, because the Beijing Italian Guard and the Tianjin Marine Corps are willing to pledge allegiance to the Italian Fascist Republican Government and vow to cooperate with Japan and the Axis powers, it has been decided to release them.

<h3>Combined War Results of Datong Police Team</h3>

<h3>Press Liaison Meeting Held in the Capital Yesterday</h3>

He also elaborated on the political situation in Europe, which lasted more than an hour.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Officials Embezzle Relief Funds</h3>
<p>[Location illegible], 6th (Central News Agency) - Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Chongqing Sixth War Zone, and the Hunan Provincial Government were defeated by the Japanese army in the recent Battle of Changde, so their prestige among the people has been swept away. Now, in order to try to restore it, they have requested Chongqing to allocate 30 million yuan as a recovery and relief fund. At the same time, they have widely publicized that they will provide relief to the general public, but the funds issued by Chongqing are only 2 million yuan, which is less than 10% of the requested amount. However, of this 2 million yuan, 1 million yuan has been embezzled by the provincial government and military circles, 500,000 yuan has been embezzled by the county magistrate, and 250,000 yuan has been embezzled by the bao chief and others. The actual amount used as relief funds is only 250,000 yuan. The corruption of the Chongqing military leaders and officials is truly astonishing. They widely publicized the relief of the people before the event, but after the event, they staged an ugly scene of embezzling public funds, so the people are full of complaints, and at the same time, the general public's sentiment is becoming more and more rebellious.</p>
<h3>Agreement on Vietnam's Supply of Rice and By-products to Japan Signed in Saigon Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Saigon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Saigon Office of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam announced at 3:00 PM on the 5th (local time) that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, and the Japanese Ambassador, Yoshizawa, signed the agreement on Vietnam's supply of rice and by-products to Japan for the current Vietnamese fiscal year at the Governor-General Decoux's residence at 4:30 PM on the 5th. At the same time, an exchange of documents extending the validity of the exchange of official documents on the entry and residence of Japanese people in Vietnam, which was concluded on March 4 of last year, was also carried out. According to the contents of the agreement on Vietnam's supply to Japan, the contents are generally the same as last year. Regarding the supply price, it has been increased in accordance with the trend of other prices to stipulate a fair price. In the future, the lives of the farmers, who account for 95% of the Vietnamese population, can be stabilized as a result, and at the same time, the main food rice of the Japanese people can also be imported by several million tons every year, which will make a great contribution to the implementation of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Winter Offensive Reaches Peak; Fierce Fighting in Western Ukraine; German Defense Battle at Dnipro Bend Wins Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report: The Soviet winter offensive is currently in full swing and has achieved initial victories in many areas. In particular, in the Zhytomyr area, the Soviet army is still adopting its old strategy of constantly shifting its focus of attack. The enemy does not seem to intend to break through the main offensive strongholds. In addition to encountering fierce attacks southwest of Krychev, fierce battle areas are beginning to form in nearly two locations. Strong Soviet units are now pouring out of Kursk and concentrating along the highway. Soviet forces are also concentrated in the Perekop Isthmus, the gateway to Crimea, and in the Cherkassy area. This Soviet winter offensive does not have the appearance of a "Russian winter." Although there is frost at night, it melts during the day.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Captain Setorius, a Huitong News Agency correspondent: The Soviet offensive north of Nevel should not yet be regarded as the focus of the war shifting to that area. The situation in Vitebsk remained unchanged on Tuesday. Several Soviet infantry divisions, covered by large tank brigades, attacked west of Polotsk. The strategic value of this enemy action is still difficult to determine. At present, the Soviet pressure in the entire western Ukraine and the old border of Poland is still fierce. The German new defense line is located on the northern flank of the Vatutin Group. The Red Army has advanced west of Olyvuske and Novograd-Volynskyi. There has been fierce fighting in Berdychiv, and the German army has withdrawn from its eastern part.</p>
<p>South of Kazatin, the enemy vanguard is advancing towards the upper reaches of the Buh River and has been temporarily blocked. The enemy is currently in an unfavorable position because the left flank of the Vatutin Army is still 150 kilometers behind, fighting in the German positions at Belaya Tserkov. The German army there is a threat to the southern flank of General Vatutin.</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities are now preparing to attack from the east, west, and north. Because of this preparation, the fighting in the Dnipro bend has eased slightly in the past few days. The movement of large enemy forces is also taking place in the Nogai Steppe. As for whether this preparation is intended to cross the Dnipro River between Tokmak and Kherson, or whether it is to launch another attack on Crimea, it is not known. In any case, the purpose of the large army gathered by the enemy on the Perekop Isthmus is undoubtedly to attack Crimea.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, military news: After a long period of silence, the Soviet army suddenly used powerful units and tank formations in the Great Dnipro bend to attack north of Kryvyi Rih and east of Kirovograd yesterday, attempting to break through the German positions. The German army intercepted or repelled the enemy in fierce battles and counterattacks, and destroyed 149 Soviet tanks in this battle. The German army also won a complete victory in the defensive battle west of Pyatikhatki yesterday. The Soviet offensive was ineffective. The bridgeheads east of the Dnipro River are still entirely in German hands.</p>
<h3>German Defenses on the Atlantic Coast Consolidated; Landing Operations Will Inevitably Be Defeated</h3>
<p>Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) - After the two meetings in Moscow and Tehran, the anti-Axis camp seems to have decided to launch an offensive operation on the European continent and established the anti-Axis army command for the invasion of Europe on December 24 of last year, using the British mainland as a base. The anti-Axis army command in the Mediterranean has also undergone major reforms to consolidate the formation for the conquest of Asia, and has declared 1944 as the year of decisive battle, striving to make people generally believe that the formation of the second front is imminent. However, from both military and political perspectives, there is an infinite sense of the time to form a second front. The German military authorities also know that while the Soviet army is continuing to launch a winter offensive, it is a good opportunity for the anti-Axis powers to carry out an offensive operation against Europe. However, the Zurich News reported from London that it fundamentally denied the possibility of a winter offensive, stating that the winter maritime climate is not suitable for landing operations and cannot be carried out according to the scheduled plan. Long nights and dense fog, although favorable for operations, the land is too muddy, and operations after landing cannot be carried out smoothly. The same is true in the Balkans. But if the anti-Axis powers abandon this opportunity, and the Soviet strength is limited, they will not be able to continue their offensive this spring. The German High Command sent Marshal Rommel to inspect the Atlantic defense line from the North Sea to the Bay of Biscay during the Tehran Conference, and actively reorganized the German defense forces along the European coast. It is reported that a part of General Dietel's corps has recently arrived in France. The German High Command has also added a large number of automatic artillery positions along the northern coast of France, and has also dispatched about a few new fighters and dive bombers. The Atlantic defense line will become stronger and stronger in the future. Even if the anti-Axis powers, fearing the prolongation of the war, take the risk of landing regardless of everything, they will inevitably be defeated by the German army.</p>
<h3>Fierce German Resistance on the Southern Italian Front; Commander of the British Eighth Army Replaced</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German news agency reports: The German army successfully prevented the anti-Axis forces from launching an offensive operation in various parts of the Southern Italian front on the 4th. The US Fifth Army sent reconnaissance aircraft to carry out reconnaissance in order to detect the German defenses, but was repelled when it reached the German forward positions. The German army also fiercely resisted the advance of the British and American forces north of Gatz Siripp on the morning of the 4th. Although the attack was extremely fierce, it ultimately failed to break through the German minefields. There was also fighting in various areas along the Adriatic coast. It is predicted that the anti-Axis forces will launch a large-scale offensive on the Southern Italian front in the next few days.</p>

<h3>US Aircraft Lose Thousands in One Year</h3>
<h3>German and French Western Cities Suffer Terrorist Air Raids; American Aircraft Lost Thousands in One Year</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday morning, a large formation of American bombers again invaded the German northern coastal area, fiercely bombing the Kiel city area. At the same time, multiple enemy aircraft also attacked western Germany, paying particular attention to the town of Dusseldorf. As in previous air raids, enemy aircraft flew high and dropped bombs under the cover of dark clouds. German anti-aircraft artillery and other air defense equipment engaged the enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage. Simultaneously, enemy aircraft also attacked occupied areas in western France. Over French territory alone, German anti-aircraft artillery shot down sixteen four-engine bombers and seven fighter planes. Reports of enemy aircraft being shot down continue to arrive, so the exact numbers are currently unknown. However, as far as is known, a total of over fifty British and American aircraft were shot down, with over four hundred aircrew lost.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to reports from London: The American Eighth Air Force heavy bomber fleet carried out ninety-five bombing raids last year, reportedly losing a total of one thousand bombers and one hundred and fifty fighter planes.

<h3>American Mortality Rate Increases Again</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to reports from New York, the American Times weekly recently reported that the mortality rate of the American people has been declining since 1940, but has been increasing again since 1943. According to American statements, the main reasons are the increase in deaths among those over fifty years old, and the impact of the wartime emergency. Among them, the number of illnesses caused by overwork has increased, thus increasing the crisis in the mortality rate. Another reason is the decrease in marriage rates. Taking New York State as an example, the number of marriage licenses issued in 1943 broke the lowest record of the past four years, dropping from 93,085 in 1940 to 78,000 in 1943.</p>

<h3>American Authorities Warn Citizens that Japanese Military Strength is Extremely Powerful</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the outbreak of this war, the American government has adopted a policy of concealment towards its citizens, only publishing false victory reports. According to reports from Washington, Rear Admiral Denfeld Ayers, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, recently broadcast a warning to the public, stating that the Japanese army still possesses enormous manpower and material resources. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, the American military has repeatedly attacked the Japanese army, but the Japanese fleet still maintains its original strength. Furthermore, the United States Office of War Information issued a statement on the night of the 4th, warning the American public, with the following main points: Anti-Axis forces have only recovered one-fiftieth of the area occupied by the German army and one-twentieth of the area occupied by the Japanese army. In the Pacific, they are still three thousand miles away from Tokyo. Moreover, the military power of the Japanese army is extremely powerful. The area occupied by the Japanese army is as vast as the United States. The American military will only be able to carry out an offensive using Pearl Harbor as a base. Conversely, the Japanese army is engaged in defense from various islands scattered throughout the Pacific, and these islands have all been built into solid naval and air force bases. Although there have been numerous fierce battles in the Pacific, the American military and anti-Axis forces have ultimately failed to engage the main forces of the Japanese army and navy. The strong morale of the Japanese soldiers is a well-known fact. Japan does not feel a lack of manpower and can mobilize 400 million laborers in the occupied territories, while the American military has only entered the outer corridors of the Japanese defense line and has not come into contact with the positions that the Japanese army must defend at any cost.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas reports from London: Marine Corps Commander Major General Adair of the Gilbert Islands stated: In the Pacific theater, the United States still has to go through many difficult and bloody battles. He hopes that the American people will not underestimate the Japanese.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas reports from London: Smith wrote in the "Daily Mail" yesterday, stating: If Japan has sufficient time to calmly adjust its war gains, there will be no hope of winning the war against Japan. The anti-Axis countries should not miss the opportunity to allow Japan to increase its strength, because the factor of time is in Japan's favor. Some people believe that Japan's industry is weak and will inevitably fail in the long term. This is a dangerous illusion. The land that Japan occupied in the early stages of the war has formed a great empire. If that country continues to possess this wealth of resources, Japan will inevitably become stronger day by day. If Japan can make good use of the natural resources in the occupied areas, Japan will become the world's leading power in a few years. Smith then called on the anti-Axis countries to change their strategy in the Pacific, because the anti-Axis countries' occupation of some islands and forests cannot weaken Japan's position. The Japanese main fleet has not yet been dispatched. If the anti-Axis countries want to defeat Japan, they must first destroy its navy. Therefore, the anti-Axis countries should force the Japanese navy to accept a major naval battle. Japan is also a strong power on land. The anti-Axis countries currently have little hope of defeating Japan on land. As for Chongqing, due to a lack of weapons, it is unable to launch a general offensive. Therefore, the long-rumored offensive in Burma will become a bubble.</p>
<h3>Conscription Ages of Various Belligerent Nations</h3>
<p>With the aim of enhancing the combat strength of the army, Japan has reduced the conscription age by one year this time. Consequently, vigorous young men of nineteen years old are all taking up arms to serve on the frontiers. Since the outbreak of the China Incident seven years ago, up to and including this great war, the Japanese army, backed by its vast and unparalleled human resources, stands in stark contrast to the panicked British and Americans, who have reduced the conscription age to eighteen and are driving them onto the battlefield. Japan has consistently adhered to the conscription age of twenty. Now, in this decisive year of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, it is concentrating the abundant human resources accumulated over seven years on the decisive battle. The United Kingdom expanded the conscription age to eighteen two years ago in 1941, and the United States did so one year ago in 1942. Japan is only now gradually sending nineteen-year-old youths to the battlefield. By comparison, it is evident that Japan's human war strategy is robust. It has established a strategic posture as secure as a rock on the mainland and in the South Seas. At the same time, Japan's potential is also fully revealed here. Japan's sending of nineteen-year-old youths to the battlefield this time to cope with the armies composed of the exhausted eighteen-year-old youths of the enemy countries further consolidates the belief in victory. The conscription ages of the main belligerent nations in World War II are compared as follows:</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>The United States boasts of having human resources of 130 million people, but according to President Roosevelt's fireside chat in 1942, it has been reduced to eighteen years old. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has simply been a mutual challenge in terms of age.</p>
<p>The United States implemented the Selective Service Act on September 16, 1940, one year before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thereby establishing the foundation for the current conscription law. According to that law, first, 16.5 million male citizens aged twenty-one to thirty-six were registered to receive one year of military training. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it was immediately cancelled, reducing twenty-one years old by three years to eighteen years old and increasing thirty-six years old to sixty-five years old. Men in this age range should be liable for conscription. However, President Roosevelt, fearing the individualism of the country, not only appealed to the people in a "fireside chat" on October 12, 1942, but also proposed to Congress, which, although passed by the House of Representatives, was ultimately opposed by the Senate (October 17).</p>
<p>Disregarding the opposition of the President and the military authorities, the Senate passed the following amendment by a vote of 39 to 31: "Young men aged eighteen and nineteen should undergo at least one year of military training in the United States before being sent overseas." Thus, at the joint meeting of the House and Senate on November 10, due to the efforts of the government, this amendment was removed and a temporary compromise was reached. On the 13th, the original proposal submitted by the President was finally signed. On November 18 of the same year, the President issued the following proclamation for those who reached the qualified age of eighteen to nineteen, and the current conscription law was established.</p>
<p>Male citizens who reach the age of eighteen after July 1, 1942, should complete their military registration from December 11 to 31.</p>
<p>Male citizens who reach the age of eighteen after January 1, 1943, should register on their birthday.</p>
<p>However, for students, limited to high school students, this conscription age is postponed until the end of the academic year, and they are free to enlist in most vocational schools and part of high school students. However, the United States also felt that this reduction in the conscription age had a great impact on the labor force in production. According to a statement by Paul McNutt, Chairman of the Wartime Human Resources Committee, the recruitment of 62.5 million human resources this year under the "Austin-Wadsworth Act" (compulsory registration and requisition of men aged eighteen to sixty-five and women aged eighteen to fifty) has also not been implemented due to strong opposition. Therefore, this current conscription law has a significant impact on the production sector. Currently, eighteen states in the United States have formulated regulations to employ teenagers from the age of sixteen to under eighteen in military factories, and seven other states are also discussing similar legislation. The labor force problem seems to be solved independently in various places. The Office of War Information report "Two Years of War in the United States," published in early December of this year, states that the current labor force in the United States, including those serving in the military, is 63.6 million people.

<h3>Mayor Chen Discusses Suppressing Price of Goods in Shanghai: Strict Punishment for Unauthorized Price Increases by Various Industries</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Recently, commodity prices in this city have been gradually rising, affecting the lives of citizens. Yesterday, reporters called on the Mayor to inquire about the municipal government's measures regarding the price issue. He kindly issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"Regarding the issue of commodity prices in this city, the municipal government is constantly planning countermeasures. Recently, it has made every effort to unify the price evaluation agencies in this city and establish a Price Evaluation Committee, thinking of using a unified evaluation agency to conduct a reasonable review of commodity prices in this city in order to achieve the goal of suppressing and stabilizing the price of goods throughout the city. Regarding rising prices, in addition to issuing repeated orders to strictly prohibit them, it has also ordered the Price Evaluation Committee to quickly draft measures to curb them. However, the wartime commodity price issue is certainly not simple. To seek a thorough suppression, it is difficult to succeed without the cooperation of officials and the people. Any policy of the government must rely on the assistance of the people, which is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. I have repeatedly reminded the citizens of this point. In the New Year's Day message to the citizens this year, I made a loud appeal to promote the awareness of all sectors. However, those who speak earnestly are ignored by those who listen. Recently, as the Lunar New Year is approaching, various industries have once again taken this opportunity to privately raise prices, causing prices to rise a lot, especially for daily necessities. Such illegal actions that only know private interests and disregard public justice are truly hateful. It must be known that raising commodity prices not only stimulates people's hearts and affects society, but is simply an act of endangering people's livelihood and disrupting social order. Since I bear the important responsibility of Mayor, I will never sit idly by. In addition to the municipal government reiterating the previous orders and strictly prohibiting it, I have now ordered the Economic Bureau and the 18 District Offices to send personnel to investigate, and ordered the First and Second Police Bureaus to assist in handling the matter. Any famous businesses in this city that dare to raise prices without authorization instead of selling goods at the limited price will be severely punished without leniency once verified. I also hope that the various trade associations will notify all member firms to uphold the government's aim of stabilizing people's livelihood, restrain themselves, and never try the law by themselves. I especially hope that the citizens will provide assistance. If they encounter stores that raise prices without authorization, they can directly report it to the Economic Bureau and the 18 District Offices of this city in secret, so that it can be investigated and punished. In short, the municipal government has already made the greatest determination to suppress and stabilize prices, and its words will be followed by actions. I hope that all sectors will pay attention."</p>
<h3>Household Rice Ration Restored to Two Sheng</h3>
<p>Effective from November, in three installments per month</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising daily, with no end in sight. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the general public is eagerly hoping for a drop in the price of rice. Especially the poor, at this time when the price of rice is soaring, their lives are extremely painful. If adjustments are not made quickly, the future of people's livelihood in Shanghai is truly worrying. Yesterday, our reporter visited Mr. Yuan Ludeng at the Rice and Grain Control Committee to inquire about the recent activities of the committee.</p>
<p>Good Results in Areas A and B</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yuan, the committee attaches great importance to its mission and is making every effort to carry out the procurement work in areas A and B. Currently, the procurement situation in both areas is very good. According to the two statistics from the offices in various places regarding the first phase of procurement, as of the end of December, the number of orders placed has reached 35% of the total planned procurement, with 2 million shi in area A and 1.1 million shi in area B. With the assistance of various Allied agencies, the first batch of over 300,000 shi of rice (enough to meet the needs of all citizens of Shanghai for more than one month) has arrived in Shanghai and will be used for special rations during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Transportation Problems Can Be Solved</p>
<p>It is also reported that the committee expects many difficulties in the future of procurement, but we are determined to make our best efforts to eliminate them. The most concerning issue at present is the transportation problem, but we firmly believe that with the assistance of the relevant agencies, it will be resolved satisfactorily soon. After repeated discussions, it has been decided by the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee that the household rice ration in this city will be restored to the previous Public Works Department ration (two sheng per person per month, distributed in three installments, with each installment giving two sheng) from January 11, 33rd year (1944). Once this is realized, the need for black market rice will naturally decrease. With supply and demand gradually moving towards equilibrium, the price of rice will naturally fall, and the future of people's livelihood in the city will gradually become stable.</p>
<p>Share the City's Difficulties and Cooperate</p>
<p>It is also said that the committee's mission is to ensure the main food supply for the people during wartime, and the responsibility it bears is very significant. If anyone intentionally obstructs the committee's legitimate business or sabotages the procurement work, whether inside or outside the committee, they will be severely punished according to law for disrupting the wartime economy. I am willing to exert my humble efforts and go all out. I hope that all citizens will understand the difficulties of the times and cooperate.</p>

<p>Saying: "Today, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you here, thanks to the friendship of Minister Hirota. We do not need to hold a meeting every three months, nor do we need a propaganda tool. Our leaders and our people know the goals of the struggle, so we would rather let them talk more and hold more meetings, while we bury ourselves in work. Regarding the current major political and military issues, the military achievements of Europe and East Asia, and future plans, our leaders have all spoken about them. Apart from these, I don't feel there is anything important enough to report to you. However, what I want to tell you is that we Germans and our Japanese friends have a strong belief in the righteousness of today's common war and the victory in the future."</p>
<h3>Coal Balls in Areas 1 and 8 Rescheduled for Distribution on the 12th; Two Installments per Month, Seven Jin per Installment</h3>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Fohai Donates Salary to Aid Education, Enthusiastically Advocates for Response from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Fohai Guang-sheng, yesterday donated ten thousand yuan from his salary to serve as the newspaper's education aid fund. In the previous education aid fund, Mr. Zhou also donated a substantial sum of two hundred thousand yuan from his salary, which shows his enthusiasm for attaching importance to and sympathizing with the education aid movement. Mr. Zhou, in his early years, also diligently studied hard, so he can deeply understand the hardship of poor students who are out of school. The "Gu Jin Ban Yue Kan" once published Mr. Zhou's "Bitter Study Record," which detailed the difficulties he faced when studying in Japan in his early years. His conclusion stated: "…There are countless young people who are as impoverished as I was at that time. Everyone should not be discouraged, disheartened, or hopeless. Heaven never cuts off all paths; a blade of grass is nourished by a drop of dew. As long as we are willing to work hard, we can break through a bloody path from heavy encirclement, no matter what the circumstances!" His spirit of courageous struggle is evident in his words. It is hoped that the students who receive the education aid fund today will deeply understand this spirit, and that all can take Mr. Zhou as a model to aspire to hard study, so as not to disappoint Mr. Zhou and the expectations of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students of Tongde College Aid Education</p>

The students are grateful for his enthusiasm, and collectively raised two thousand two hundred yuan in national currency. They presented it to Professor Gu, but Professor Gu firmly declined to accept it, instructing that the money be donated to this newspaper's education aid fund. The original letter is excerpted below: "Gentlemen, you are in the prime of your youth, with a fiery passion that touches the heart. I originally intended to firmly decline, but considering that you would definitely change it to other methods, I have now come up with a way, that is, to donate this money in the name of the third grade of Tongde, to the education aid fund organized by Shen Bao, for the benefit of all the students and Hanyi, and to set an example, inspiring other schools to promote this kind of good deed." Professor Gu is enthusiastic about education, and has put in a lot of effort. This newspaper would like to express its gratitude to him on behalf of the poor students, and deeply hopes that the education community will follow suit and work together to achieve this great undertaking.</p>

<p>Economic Circle Comments</p>
<h3>Taking Matches, Candles, and Soap as Examples</h3>
<p>Since the New Year, the prices of daily necessities in the wood market have continued to rise, and this occurred before the Lunar New Year, so the threat to the lives of ordinary people is self-evident. Taking matches, candles, and soap as examples, the severity of the price increase is astonishing. If it is like this for three kinds of daily necessities, then it is the same for hundreds and thousands of kinds of daily necessities. As the price increase trend continues, all prices inevitably "rise with the tide," only making the value of goods and the value of money run in opposite directions, drifting further and further apart. Because the value of goods is rising endlessly, the value of money is also falling endlessly. This is the beginning of the people's psychology of despising the value of money, which should not only be actively suppressed by the ruling authorities, but also be remedied by the financial authorities.</p>
<p>From the perspective of materials control, once the rationing of daily necessities is implemented, prices only increase and never decrease, becoming even more serious. This is the case for rice, coal, sugar, oil, matches, soap, and even cigarettes. The crux of the matter is that the rationing system cannot satisfy people or allow them to live at the bare minimum. Therefore, the supply of daily necessities can only rely on the black market. Since it is the black market, there is no standard to follow for prices. Today it increases by one time, tomorrow it can increase by ten times, who will interfere?</p>
<p>As a result, those who seek exorbitant profits engage in hoarding every day, and those who worry about price increases also engage in hoarding every day. The more they hoard, the more prices rise, and the more prices rise, the more they hoard, thus causing prices to rise endlessly. Therefore, to stop the price increase trend, in the short term, the focus should still be on cracking down on hoarding and eliminating the black market, otherwise materials rationing will always become a "pie in the sky." Now the ruling authorities have recognized this point, so the Materials Investigation Committee has already ordered the separate investigation of the latest Shanghai inventory and production of matches, candles, and soap, in order to prevent the concealment of false reports. We believe that this is the initial work to streamline all materials rationing, and it should be expanded and promoted as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Sets the 20th as the Final Closing Date</h3>
<p>The final closing of various industries and businesses is usually based on the lunar calendar. It is heard that the Money Industry Association has decided that the final closing date for the thirty-second year will be January 24th, which is Lunar New Year's Eve, and the closing period will be from the 25th to the 28th. The market will reopen on the 29th (Saturday) for trading. Regarding the business that each bank should handle during the final closing period, such as the collection and settlement of bills, the market interest rate, the last day of trading, interest on deposits and debts, and the market situation, will be decided by the association at a meeting. Recently, all industries have been preparing for the final closing, such as adjusting funds and repaying overdrafts from various banks with and without contractual agreements. In addition, the silver and money industries are preparing their treasuries to regulate the finance of the same industry. In accordance with the borrowing methods and the limits set, they will make every effort to accommodate and handle the lending and borrowing of various banks. B Type Grain Depot Vouchers Issued</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise Then Fall, Match Stocks Alone Show Their Edge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned sluggish. Those who expected the market to rise were disappointed and began to sell off, resulting in small losses in many cases. However, some stocks still progressed upwards, such as Da Zhonghua Matches, which rose by more than one hundred yuan due to news of a capital increase and seven shares. In the textile industry, China Silk stood out, breaking through the 400 yuan mark and rising by another 30 yuan. Ren Salt soared to six yuan. Mei Ya, Wu He, and China Underwear continued to rise. Among the industrial stocks, Li Ya, which is related to the silk industry, rose by three and a half yuan alone. San Le Industrial was firm. The trend of selling off real estate stocks has begun, and it is inferior to department stores and stationery. New pharmaceutical stocks rose and fell inconsistently. Public utility stocks were the most stable, and the rest suffered small losses. The closing price list for today is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Association, in order to encourage people to save and develop the habit of thrift, has added a special type of installment savings, with a lottery held once a month. Savers pay 50 yuan of national currency per month. After paying for five full years, they no longer need to pay, but still continue to enjoy the lottery right for two years. Therefore, paying 60 times can get as many as 84 lottery opportunities, and there is no limit to the amount of the lottery won. After paying for one and a half years, they can also use the membership certificate to apply for a loan from the association.</p>

<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Appeals to All Sectors for Assistance</h3>
<p>New Pu Yu Tang in Nanshi has been established for more than 30 years. It shelters the old, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows, and has achieved remarkable results in its charitable work. In the past, the annual expenses were about 500,000 yuan. Recently, the prices of all goods have soared, and the economic situation is extremely difficult. Even with the enthusiasm and determination of the organizers, it is difficult to maintain. Under these circumstances, we can only appeal to all sectors, asking kind people in society to donate cash or goods, all of which are needed. The donation collection point is the Catholic Church on Yangjingbang Catholic Church Street in the eighth district. The donation collection point is the Trust Department of Chouye Bank, 460 Hankou Road, the Banque Belge Pour L’Etranger, Sassoon House on the Bund, 47 Yunnan Road, Jihua Hall, 356 Fuzhou Road, Huamei Pharmacy. The above locations will remit the money and goods received to Pu Yu Tang, which will be publicly announced from time to time to show great faith. "It is more blessed to give than to receive." It is earnestly hoped that all sectors will work hard to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Aspiration (1)</p>
<p>When the summer vacation arrived, the students enthusiastically began swimming and ice bathing at Tenpozan Kaien and Yojiro Beach.</p>
<p>Zhenren also went to the beach, but he could only lie on the sand, sulking and biting his lower lip. Although he didn't swim very well, breaststroke was not a problem for him, but because he didn't have his mother's permission, he couldn't go into the water. He could only take off his clothes and sunbathe his back from morning to relieve his worries.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, during the holidays, you must all become blacks. I dislike white faces the most. When the new semester starts, there will be a black race, and gentlemen, don't lose in this race." This was the instruction given by Major Kikuchi in pure Kumamoto dialect during the last class. Zhenren's refusal to admit defeat further aroused his determination to sunbathe his back. The reason was that he knew very well that he was a "white face."</p>
<p>At first, Longfu also accompanied him to sunbathe his back. When the heat became too high, he would dive into the transparent blue waves. Only Zhenren alone endured the dizziness, sunbathing his back and chest, turning over like roasted meat.</p>
<p>(I didn't know before that Mr. Nakahara Yukie was such a great man!)</p>
<p>The emotion of the principal's speech revived in his chest. According to the principal, Hiraga Gennai and Sakuma Shozan used scientific theory to experiment with electricity, while Nakahara Yukie applied it to military affairs. Although Yukie used the primitive method of oil paper to isolate the tyrant's breath, he eventually created batteries made of zinc, copper plates, and dilute sulfuric acid, and successfully experimented with using this current to explode electric motors and groundmines. His research science also benefited people's livelihoods, such as manufacturing glass, with the thick glass used for warships' windows being the first. The use of carbonated acid for disinfection was also for wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>(Should I become a scientist too?…)</p>
<p>Smelling the burning hot sand, Zhenren fainted and envisioned his future. According to the grades written on the report card, his scores in mathematics and language were close to one hundred, so this hope was not unreasonable. Especially being the first in his class to discover the existence of that monument seemed to be destined to emulate Nakahara Tesshin.</p>
<p>In an instant, his hope was pushed into the deep valley of a thousand depths. His elder sister Chunzi had married, and the business in the store had been booming recently, but his family's financial situation could not easily guarantee his student life from high school to university.</p>
<p>(After graduating from middle school, will I become a bank clerk?…)</p>
<p>He stared at the shadow of the islet on the sea with bored and tearful eyes,</p>
