<h3 id="c1">糧食問題的考慮時機 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>糧食問題，是關係民生最重要的問題。而過去處理糧食問題，卻已形成了走不通的局面。以最重要的問題，處理得走不通，所以，影響於民生的痛苦，不言可喻了。</p>
<p>當去年九月間，因為糧政窳敗，日甚一日，糧食問題益　嚴重，政府為期調整刷新，組設米糧統制委員會，迄今八閱月，從整個糧食問題檢討，實在是治絲益棼，每況愈下，但聞其弊，未見其利。持平以論，米統會過去工作的失敗，已毋庸諱言，試加檢討其失敗原因，約如下列：</p>
<p>各產米區域，原有當地米商，直接向的情感維繫與信譽地位。上海的米商，則居於委託地位，並不與產地農民直接發生關係。但米統會成立以後，對於採辦工作，並未利用產米區域原有米商組織，而以官方姿態，重起爐灶，延用許多採辦商人，頗多外行是非法活動，使採辦公作形成壓迫農民的工具，信譽低落，絕對談不到採辦成績，這是米統會採取辦米糧忽視環境的錯誤。</p>
<p>米統會除成立之後，正當新榖登場之時，而彼時米統會收米資金未即籌足，麻袋未即充分準備，倉庫未即普遍設立，以致大批米糧可以收買，而資金工具不敷運用。</p>
<p>米統會負責幹部曁大多數採辦商，對於辦理糧政缺乏志願與經騐。即盟邦人士參加工作者，雖具一番熱情，但亦缺乏經驗。</p>
<p>米統會人事不健全，不肖者插足其間，乘機作弊，而不加制裁。例如高級職員盛度，舞弊雖有實據，祗以撤職了事，放縱避。其次，機構組織龐大，職員太多，冗充塞，開支浩大，月達八百萬元。</p>
<p>米統會成立八閱月來，失敗癥結旣如上述，而糧食問題更趨嚴重，在情勢上已局考盧「存在」「撤銷」或「改組」之時機，如果一味因循，則整個會之名譽墮落事小，民食貽誤之關係實大。在此考慮時機，我們率先提供若干注意之點：</p>
<p>就上海而言，過去從糧食部到米統會之過渡期間，兩個月中戶口米落空。現在如有更張，即應注意不使落空。</p>
<p>戰時軍糧，固極重要，但應由中央政府單獨負責，充分供給。過去糧政機關，發現糧食部之舞弊，米統會之不健全，而民營米商中亦多不肖份子從中作弊。如將來考慮精神統制，改革買賣方法時，仍應注意一般中間者剝削操縱，必須嚴密防止。</p>
<p>在米統會未成立之前，上海戶口米之配給，比較米統會成立以後，無論在數量與期限上均爲差勝一籌，而過去一年間，本市第一區公署經濟處辦理配給相當努力，惜只有配給權而無採辦權，對於配米來源，得到盟邦當局助力很多。假定將來上海一市的民食，由上海市主管機構直接採辦，直接配給，或可比較目前的成效為佳。</p>
<p>將來採辦成績，縱然滿意，但運輸問題，至爲重要，因此，加强疏運能力，消除阻礙，尤須注意。</p>
<p>最後，我們必須注意農民因為遭受官營中間人低價收買的壓迫，對於種植米榖，抱具消極態度，足以減少糧產，這是根本的嚴重問題，應該如何使農民轉變消極態度，將勵生產，最為迫切，我們希望市政當局曁市政咨詢委員會生活必需品小組委員會諸公，充分注意上面各點，迅籌切實對策，為民食問題打開僵局，為民生安定奠植始基。</p>
<h3 id="c2">哥希馬附近激戰　布其頓英軍後撤　巴列爾敵兵舍三百棟燒毀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　據印度前綫日軍某基地電，五月四日晨十時半，曾有敵軍七百，擁有戰車三十餘輛，於敵機轟炸一小時後，前來逆襲哥希馬附近之日軍陣地。日軍各部隊即以戰車武器及手溜彈攻擊敵戰車，當擊毀敵大型及輕戰車十二輛，輕裝甲軍兩輛。又是役曾有日機四十餘架飛臨哥希馬上空，猛炸茲布柴及喬特文曼方面之敵王力陣地，將之完全粉碎。五日敵軍二百復以戰車十七輛爲先導，强襲日軍陣地，日軍某部隊當即還擊之，將之誘過陣地後，即施以肉搏，其大部被擊毀，日軍繼之實行突擊，瞬將敵兵擊滅，敵棄屍五十三具，日軍鹵獲自動步槍十五枝，機關槍一架，步槍彈藥等甚夥。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據康提諾電，東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部七日發表：英印軍爲縮短戰綫，已自阿拉坎戰綫之布其頓撤退。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　印度最前綫電，日軍精銳部隊對巴列爾之攻擊，愈益熾烈，本月一日拂曉，急襲巴列爾敵軍營舍羣，與數百英兵激戰後，燒英兵舍約三百棟。另一隊日軍，一日拂曉攻進巴列爾南方阿魯摩爾瑪亞炸燬橋樑，破壞巴列爾東南方高地之敵軍逃路。又巴列爾北方七公里三五二五高地之日軍，擊破敵軍執拗之逆襲，確保陣地，對巴列爾·伊姆法爾公路予以直接威脅。由此觀之，攻擊巴列爾之戰，極其苛烈，已入最後階段。又約六百殘敵，刻於巴列爾陷落之前，仍作最後拚命抵抗。</p>
<h3 id="c3">東亞兩大支柱　必攜手共進　郭秀峯在日發表談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　國府宣傳部次長兼中央電訊社長郭秀峰，副社長胡瀛洲，爲考察日本之宣傳通訊事業，七日下午扺東京。郭氏八日會見記者，發表談話如次：「本人因兼任鄙國中央電訊社社長職務，承蒙同盟通訊社招待，得親臨貴國與新聞界諸先進開誠懇談，共商今後兩國新聞報道之緊密協力，並藉此機綠得親覩貴國戰時之眞姿態，實深感幸。余於來東京途中，先詣伊勢參拜神宮，瞻仰聖域，對貴國肇國精神，彌深做認，尤爲榮幸。沿途目覩貴國國民，同心同德，各就本位，勤勞奉公，不論男女老幼，均具極堅强之必勝信念，極勇猛之戰鬥精神，雖於此決戰階段，社會秩序，有條不紊，一切情形，一如平昔，具見貴國社會組織之健全，戰鬥力做之雄厚，決非敵人之所能想像。鄙國於大東亞戰爭之始，即認此次戰爭爲東亞民族興亡之所聲，乃以同甘共苦之精神，共荷艱鉅。及去年一月九日，國民政府毅然參戰，更由同甘共苦進至同生共死之境地，而貴國對華新政策。亦開始實施交還租界，撤廢治外法權，更於去年十一月改訂條約，援助鄙國完成獨立解放，此種精神，固爲鄙國朝野上下之所深悉，惟以國力所限，未能與盟邦將士效命疆塲，可能　於戰爭者尙少，言之殊深慚愧。鄙國地處後方，前方後方，責任同樣重大，今年元旦，注主席指示三點，勉勗國人，一爲肅正思想，二爲保障治安，三爲增加生產，均爲後方應盡最低限度之責任。關於肅正思想，有新國民運動之展開，關於保障治安，有淸鄕工作之推進，關於增加生產，有農業增產計劃之實施，吾人正向此三大目標努力邁進，俾稍盡棉薄，以期無負盟邦期望之殷切，惜重慶方面尙誤信英·美，自棄東亞立塲，執迷抗戰，至今全國未獲統一，致使各種施策，未能如意推行，實深遺憾。然自去年大東亞宣言發表以來，東亞建設已有明確不移之　規，東亞人終為東亞人，重慶遲早終有醒悟之一日，中·日爲兄弟之邦，又爲東亞民族之兩支柱，解放曰東亞，責無旁貸，中國必為盟邦後盾，攜手前進，寂滅英·美，建設光榮燦爛之新東亞上當信而無疑者也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">考察華北經濟後　山本氏發表感想 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日政府蠡以山木大東亞省次官爲團長而派遺之華北經濟視察團，就大東亞重要資源基地之華北，蒙疆等經濟情況，詳爲視察，對遂行本年度之大增產計劃上，已予以側面之援助，頃該次官就此次視察所得發表所感如次：於各常地欲行發展一種產業，亦則開發鐵山或建設工廠，於政治，經濟以及文化方面，皆須包括於綜合施策之內，且更須以綜合力量恒久推進。更因各種事業係於中國之內實施，故如何能使中·日協力，以　滿遂行計劃，尤須注意，因此無論勞務問題，以及公司本身問題，若將產業經營方式以日本式而推行於中國，非僅幣害業生，一無效果·對此點亦須順應當地實情，如建設工廠時，則須考究與工廠附近衆工住民間之關聯性，有某公司於一年前及注意於此，故履得良好成績。此外，對於中國推行之施策，尤須深加反省。其次須性急，中·日雙方合作時如欠圓滑時，則須自行負責，使之解決，如此互相勉勵，責不旁貸，軍官民齊心協力勇往前進。又日本內地人士對在國外工作人員，必須深切信賴，對其一切皆須任其自由進行。目下各地方面中·日軍官民均一致協力，而向增强重要物資生產之途邁進，對此，日本國民尤須表示深切敬意與感謝。</p>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，著手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭完遂，乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分製東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰線，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，且嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府爲此宜吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一搽英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序，德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋。迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相興呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此爲實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之獲得，胥緊於此。其一德一心，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<p>— 牛塲信彥</p>
<p>我在倫敦時，曾經騐德空軍的轟炸，到德國後，又經騐英空軍的轟炸。那時候得來的經騐，在空襲時，最初一擊的影響最大。且敵方如實施相當大規模的空襲，則精神上的衝動亦極大。當初因家屋破壞，人畜死傷，發生火災，而流傳着某種恐怖，不免有多少混亂。但至當時所感到的意外的少，於是不安也漸滅少了，情緒重歸平靜。</p>
<h3 id="c28">忍耐最初一擊 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>苟能耐得住最初的一擊，以後就會習慣的。同時，因過民生活也漸適應空襲，例如疏散老幼，合宿，共炊等防空態勢的整備，致敵方所企圖的精神上效果，被空襲者的敵愾心，反因此而更激昂。</p>
<p>說道德英的空製對策，因方法的不同，國情的相異，殊不能簡單加以比較。但雙方所採的方法。都切合國情，在民衆的士氣這一點上，都非常旺盛。</p>
<p>先看德國，對敵方的空襲早已妥籌對策。如地下防空壕等常加補强，用鐵筋構築堅固的防空壕。但眞正知道空襲之可怖的，還是去年漢堡大空襲之後的事，自此以後，報章上亦常常强調防空態勢的强化。此前，德國雖也勸令人民疏做，但迄禾澈底實行，自從八月一日柏林，漢堡佈告先事疏數以來，雖然受到那樣大規模的轟炸，但損害的比例極少。那時候柏林疏散的市民約近百萬，相當澈底。疏散的方法，並不是以家族爲單位，而是用集團疏散的方法。這是由勞働服務團訓練的，所以和日本不同。</p>
<h3 id="c29">食糧重於一切 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>空襲對策上最重要的是食糧問題，及運輸問題。受到相當大規模空襲的時候，電車，火車等交通機關，大體上不能不停止。尤其如電車等，被破壞的時候，很不容易復舊。至於火車，車站的恢復從幾迅速，也得相當的時間。結果避難的人，修理材料的運輸，都不能不應用載重車，公共汽車。這些事先如沒有充分的準備，都市的一切機能就要停止。且這種準備必須統一的計劃，不能各自爲政，始能充分發揮運輸力。這準備如不周到，無論有多少食糧，多少材料，都不能活。在這幾點上，在德國以納粹黨爲主體，組織極爲完善。</p>
<p>一般的防空對策，德國也與日本一樣，採鄰組（保甲）制度。這是因爲在空襲的時候，警察和消防都無暇顧到，祗有自已動手，防火消防器具自然會不另外有大的器具，主要的是水和砂。</p>
<p>在都市轟炸中，大概燒夷彈最多，所以火災的損失也最大。而且擲落燒夷彈的塲合，必夾雜炸彈，其主要目的，倒不是在破壞家屋，而阻止從事消火的市民。可是炸彈落下的時候，苟不冒險消火，立即變成火災。這一點，德國人民實極勇敢。</p>
<p>沒有食糧，沒有宿處，人們終要恐慌的。人們如果不飲·不食，不眠，無諭怎樣不能呌他們工作。一度討空　以後，無論防空對策多麼妥善，不免有多少損害。這種現象是勞所必然的，所以如不想到事後的應付，而沒有完全整備，任何防空對策都沒有意義。</p>
<h3 id="c30">妥籌滅火方法 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>因空襲而發生火災的塲合，做現在這樣防空的程度，都不能簡單地減火。從這點說來，更必須充分考慮受空襲後的情形，而更加努力與準備。例如家屋的瓦片，門板類等最少限度的修理材料，絕對須準瓦修理後就可以使用的家屋，因爲沒有瓦而不能使用了。</p>
<p>再看日本塲合，規模旣不同，建築物的性質也不同，所以因轟炸所造成的損害，不必這樣擔心恐懼。但因多木造建築物，對火災不能不妥籌完善的消火方法。而且罹災者的對策，如半毀半焚家屋的修理，也應該充分考慮。</p>
<p>就國民性而言，日本人富於規律與義務的觀念，英美人不必說，即德國人也比不上。所以雖屢被空襲，國民的士氣也不會沮喪，縱使在一夜之中幾萬人喪失了家，也會設法安揷，關於治安，食糧，運輸問題等，雖受極大的損害，也不會引起何種不安。</p>
<h3 id="c31">不必提心吊膽 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>跟着戰局的日趨緊張激烈，一部份國民似乎非常恐懼空襲的到來，可是那不必惴惴自懼的。防空設備能够完善，老幼等應疏散的從速疏散，對敵機來襲有充分的準備，則不必因空襲而變成神經質。總而言之，細心大胆這四個字，對空襲對策也是最適用的。（翔：譯自三月十九日週刋每</p>

<h3 id="c49">說起收買價格 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>傅聞統制當局對於米麥棉三項物資收買價格，正在積極研究調整，以適合農民生活爲標準，遂決定於本年新貨上市時實行·木來提高農產物收買價格，是經濟界有識之士的一實主張，初無一人甘於附和抑低農產物收買價格的自殺政策者。</p>
<p>如果收買價格不加調整的話，其影響所及，自其近者而言，不外兩種：　影響到目前的收買工作，　影響到農民的生活問題，可是，自其遠者而言，至少也有兩種：　主要物資的逐漸減少，　都市銀根的逐漸緊縮。何以主要物資減少？農民鑒於種米　　種棉之無利可圖，於是改種其他作物，例如鄰近上海之松江靑浦一帶，近年以還，米雖仍列於第一位，但黃豆菜籽則升至第一三位，而小麥棉花則降至第四五位了。何以都市銀根緊縮了，因爲農民講買力的薄弱，都市的製成品不能大量流到樣村，遂使滞留於農村的資金，不能大量流回都市，也成爲都市銀根緊縮的許多因素之一了。</p>
<p>現在，調整收買價格，旣已在積極研究中，我們相信米棉粉麥三委會於研究和實行調整方案的時候，一定會　到以下雨個要點：　不可採取强制方式，一方面固當以適合農民生活爲標準，一方面更當以符合農民希望爲依歸，　不可再有中飽行爲，農民與農民間的農，因不容有中飽情事，農民與當局問的官，更不容有中飽情事，否則提高收買價格以後的利益，紙怕仍然不能完全屬於最大多數的農民！</p>

<p>日駐華大使館上海事務所松平情栽部長，昨（八）日下午三時在循例報道常會席上，就此次英印政府釋放甘地翁事，特發表感想如下</p>
<p>被扣迄今二載　餘</p>
<p>松平部長首謂：前年八月九日英印政府突扣留甘地暨印獨立國民會議派領袖，迄今已達二載有餘，此次忽於本月六日英印政府發表聲明，藉詞健康上之設想，無條件釋放甘地。按廿地翁與國民會議派被遭逮捕幽　之原因，爰自前年八月七日印獨立國民會議派在孟買召開會議決定：　英國勢力立刻退出印度，　成立印度聯邦政府，　決定戰爭對策，　上項各條如英拒絕接受，全印民衆在甘地翁領導之下，開始不服從運動。詎越二日，印國民會　派乃竟遭英印政府全部逮捕，此後英政府又嗾使渝蔣介石赴印企圖緩和國民會議派之獨立意旨，結果印國民獨立派運動日益澎湃，最後英印政府竟斷然採取武力，壓迫國民會議派之自由。</p>
<p>獨立運動並不停頓</p>
<p>目甘地翁幽禁暨國民會議派領袖失去自由之消息傳至渝方後，渝方竟禁止各帮發表此消息，渝當地與論大嘩，並嚴詞指據淪政權所採取此項措廈，因此渝方對印度問題，應付頗為困難，甘地夫人被監　後，於月前　斃獄中，此外並根據去年十一月一日印事務大臣阿梅里所發表者，謂印國民會議派要人被幽禁於監獄者，計　一萬五千七百六十一名之多，而已遭受失去自由與被監視者，亦達七千二百六十七名，於此足見英國對印度獨立所採取之嚴峻毒辣手段。今次英印政府釋放甘地翁，在事實上印度之獨立運動並不因此停頓，當目前日軍與印國民軍之浩蕩進擊，印度之之獨立空氣較昔更爲蓬勃，是乃必然之事實。松平部長末謂　放被扣之印國民會議派人士，及完成印度之獨立，此亦解放大東亞民族目標之一，中日兩大民族爲達成此目的起見，當作更進一步之努力。</p>

<p>南市滬西垃圾，近來都已有堆積如山者，日久不免起腐化作用，滋生細菌，傳染病疫，影嚮市民健康，定匪鮮淺。况天氣漸熱，病菌繁殖容易，疫病的傳染，恐將益形猖獗，南市術生當局，曾爲此而舉辦義演，籌備徑費，以便淸除之。可覓垃圾的淸除，已是不容或緩的事了。昨日（三日）新聞報訥先生，曾　獻一個高見，說是將垃圾填塞徐家匯等處的臭池浜，移東補西，當然也是個好辦法。</p>
<p>不過鄙人以爲將全市母日堆積起來的垃圾，去項　異池浜，日後恐未必全能填得下，棄之他處，耽麻煩，又可惜。故鄙人擬請當局能獎勵益民盡量把垃圾搬到鄉下去，以作肥料，實慶物利用的最好辦法。因爲目前糧食貴，肥料也貴，如吾鄉目前每祖人　醫三十多元，且　有多量淸水而又不易購到呢·至於豆餅則每張需七百多元，農民有因限於經濟，有因欲購無貨，施肥往往不足。這自然使生產減少而刺激到價格的上漲，一致眞影響到民生。是無適量的肥料施入田中，則欲其增產，豈非等於　木求魚。</p>
<p>戰前吾鄉農田肥料除豆餅肥田粉外，人　及垃圾，向由民船從上海裝去，價甚便宜，農民除天災外，鮮有以施肥不足而歡收者，故往時難耕地面積少而收穫甚豐。現在則完全與之相反，可見施肥的足不足，實足以影響到達的辦法，莫如儘量利用酸物，如上海每日的垃圾不指有多少，這種垃圾，實是很好的堆積肥料，當其起化學作用時，便產生有機物質，以作植物的養料。據農民云又能改良土質，促使植物容易生長，眞是價廉物美，農民現正求之不得呢。</p>
<p>鄙人深望當局獎勵農民自動將垃圾裝運到鄉間，以作肥料。至於實仃之法，當局紙須將上海劃幾個區域，再指定某鄉（最好是近上海的）至某區淸除，（劃區所以防爭奪），並必須在每日淸晨五時以前，由少數淸道夫領導淸除乾淨，農民則依保甲組織肥料採運隊，　車　舟，不旬日，則此等廢物，盡可搬入田中，此誠一舉兩得之法，何樂而不爲哉，如業當局採納實行，則市民幸甚，農民幸甚。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Opportunity to Consider the Grain Problem <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The grain problem is the most important issue concerning people's livelihoods. However, the way the grain problem has been handled in the past has reached a dead end. Because this most important problem has been handled so poorly, the suffering of the people is self-evident.</p>
<p>In September of last year, as corruption in grain administration worsened day by day, and the grain problem became increasingly serious, the government, in order to adjust and reform, established the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Eight months have passed, and a review of the entire grain problem reveals that it has only become more complicated and deteriorated. We only hear of its drawbacks, but see no benefits. Objectively speaking, the failure of the Rice and Grain Control Committee's work in the past is undeniable. Let us examine the reasons for its failure, which are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In each rice-producing region, there were local rice merchants who had direct emotional ties and a reputation. Rice merchants in Shanghai, however, were in a position of trust and did not have direct contact with farmers in the producing areas. However, after the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, it did not utilize the existing rice merchant organizations in the rice-producing areas for procurement work, but instead adopted an official stance, starting from scratch and employing many procurement merchants who were mostly amateurs or engaged in illegal activities. This turned the procurement work into a tool for oppressing farmers, leading to a decline in credibility and making successful procurement impossible. This was an error in the Rice and Grain Control Committee's neglect of the environment in procuring rice and grain.</p>
<p>After its establishment, the Rice and Grain Control Committee was unable to raise sufficient funds for rice procurement, prepare enough sacks, or establish enough warehouses in time for the new grain harvest season. As a result, a large amount of grain could have been purchased, but the funds and tools were insufficient.</p>
<p>The responsible cadres of the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the majority of procurement merchants lacked the will and experience to handle grain administration. Even those from allied countries who participated in the work, while enthusiastic, also lacked experience.</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee's personnel system was unsound, allowing unscrupulous individuals to infiltrate and take advantage of loopholes without being punished. For example, although there was concrete evidence of corruption by senior official Sheng Du, he was only dismissed from his position, allowing him to get away with it. Furthermore, the organization was large, with too many redundant staff, resulting in huge expenses, reaching eight million yuan per month.</p>
<p>Having outlined the root causes of the Rice and Grain Control Committee's failure over the past eight months, and with the grain problem becoming even more serious, the situation has reached a point where it is time to consider its "existence," "abolition," or "reorganization." If we continue to procrastinate, the reputation of the entire committee will be tarnished, which is a minor matter compared to the impact on the people's food supply. At this crucial juncture, we would like to offer some points to consider:</p>
<p>As far as Shanghai is concerned, during the transition period from the Grain Department to the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past, household rice was unavailable for two months. If there are any changes now, attention should be paid to preventing this from happening again.</p>
<p>Wartime military grain is undoubtedly extremely important, but it should be the sole responsibility of the central government to ensure a sufficient supply. In the past, grain administration agencies discovered corruption in the Grain Department and shortcomings in the Rice and Grain Control Committee, while many unscrupulous individuals among private rice merchants also engaged in corruption. If unified control is considered in the future, and the methods of buying and selling are reformed, attention should still be paid to preventing exploitation and manipulation by intermediaries, and strict prevention is necessary.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, the allocation of household rice in Shanghai was superior to that after its establishment, both in terms of quantity and duration. In the past year, the Economic Affairs Office of the First District Public Office of this city made considerable efforts in handling allocation, but unfortunately, it only had the right to allocate and not the right to procure. It received a great deal of assistance from allied authorities in obtaining rice sources. Assuming that in the future, the municipal government of Shanghai directly procures and distributes food for the city, the results may be better than the current situation.</p>
<p>Even if the procurement results are satisfactory in the future, the transportation problem is extremely important. Therefore, strengthening transportation capacity and eliminating obstacles is particularly important.</p>
<p>Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that farmers, due to the pressure of being bought at low prices by government-run intermediaries, have adopted a negative attitude towards planting rice, which is enough to reduce grain production. This is a fundamental and serious problem. How to change the farmers' negative attitude and encourage production is most urgent. We hope that the municipal authorities and the members of the Living Necessities Subcommittee of the Municipal Advisory Committee will pay full attention to the above points, quickly devise practical countermeasures, break the deadlock in the food problem, and lay the foundation for the stability of people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fierce Fighting Near Kohima; British Troops Retreat from Buthidaung; Enemy Troops Burned Down Three Hundred Barracks in Palel <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a Japanese base on the Indian front, on the morning of May 4th at 10:30 AM, 700 enemy troops, with over 30 tanks, launched a counterattack on Japanese positions near Kohima after an hour of bombing by enemy aircraft. Japanese units immediately used tank weapons and hand grenades to attack enemy tanks, destroying 12 large and light tanks and two light armored vehicles. During the battle, 40 Japanese aircraft flew over Kohima and heavily bombed enemy Wang Li positions in the Zubza and Jotsoma areas, completely crushing them. On the 5th, 200 enemy troops, led by 17 tanks, launched a strong attack on Japanese positions. A Japanese unit immediately counterattacked, luring them past the positions and then engaging in close combat. Most of the enemy were destroyed, and the Japanese army then launched a surprise attack, instantly wiping out the enemy troops. The enemy abandoned 53 bodies, and the Japanese army captured 15 automatic rifles, one machine gun, and a large quantity of ammunition.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Contino, the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Command announced on the 7th that British and Indian troops had withdrawn from Buthidaung on the Arakan front in order to shorten the battle line.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Indian front, the Japanese army's elite forces are intensifying their attack on Palel. At dawn on the 1st of this month, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy barracks group in Palel, engaging in fierce fighting with hundreds of British soldiers and burning down approximately 300 barracks. Another Japanese unit attacked and entered Arumolmarma south of Palel at dawn on the 1st, blowing up bridges and destroying the enemy's escape route in the highlands southeast of Palel. Furthermore, the Japanese army at Highland 3525, 7 kilometers north of Palel, broke through the enemy's stubborn counterattack, secured the position, and directly threatened the Palel-Imphal highway. From this, it can be seen that the battle to attack Palel is extremely fierce and has entered its final stage. Approximately 600 remnant enemy troops are still putting up a last desperate resistance before the fall of Palel.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Guo Xiufeng, Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department of the National Government and President of the Central Telegraph Agency, and Vice President Hu Yingzhou, arrived in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 7th to investigate the propaganda and communication industries in Japan. Guo met with reporters on the 8th and made the following remarks: "As the concurrent President of the Central Telegraph Agency of our country, I am honored to be invited by the Allied News Agency to personally come to your country and have frank discussions with senior members of the press, to discuss the close cooperation between our two countries in news reporting in the future, and to take this opportunity to personally witness the true state of your country during wartime. I feel deeply fortunate. On the way to Tokyo, I first visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pay respects to the sacred site and deepen my understanding of the spirit of your country's founding. I am especially honored. Along the way, I witnessed the people of your country, united in heart and mind, diligently fulfilling their duties in their respective positions. Regardless of gender, age, or status, they all possess an extremely strong belief in victory and an extremely courageous fighting spirit. Even in this decisive stage, social order is maintained in an orderly manner, and everything is as usual, which demonstrates the soundness of your country's social organization and the strength of its fighting power, which is beyond the imagination of the enemy. Our country recognized from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War that this war was a matter of the rise and fall of the East Asian nations. We shared the hardships and shouldered the difficult task together. On January 9th of last year, the National Government resolutely entered the war, moving from sharing hardships to sharing life and death. Your country's new policy towards China also began to be implemented, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. Last November, the treaty was revised to assist our country in completing its independence and liberation. This spirit is deeply understood by our country's government and people. However, due to the limitations of our national strength, we have not been able to contribute to the war as much as our allied soldiers. I am deeply ashamed to say this. Our country is located in the rear, but the responsibilities of the front and the rear are equally important. On New Year's Day this year, President Wang pointed out three points to encourage the people: first, to rectify our thinking; second, to safeguard public order; and third, to increase production. These are the minimum responsibilities that the rear should fulfill. Regarding rectifying our thinking, the New National Movement has been launched. Regarding safeguarding public order, the Clean Countryside Work has been promoted. Regarding increasing production, the agricultural production increase plan is being implemented. We are striving towards these three major goals in order to contribute our modest efforts and not fail the eager expectations of our allies. Unfortunately, Chongqing still mistakenly believes in Britain and the United States, abandons the East Asian stance, and stubbornly resists, so the country has not yet achieved unification, which is deeply regrettable. However, since the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration last year, the construction of East Asia has had a clear and unwavering framework. East Asians will ultimately be for East Asians. Chongqing will eventually come to its senses. China and Japan are brotherly countries and two pillars of the East Asian nations. We have an unshirkable responsibility to liberate East Asia. China must be the rear of the allies, join hands and move forward, extinguish Britain and the United States, and build a glorious and splendid new East Asia. This is something we should believe in without doubt."</p>
<h3 id="e4">Mr. Yamamoto's Impressions After Inspecting the Economy of North China <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The North China Economic Inspection Group, dispatched by the Japanese government with Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry as its leader, conducted a detailed inspection of the economic situation in North China, Mengjiang, and other important resource bases in Greater East Asia, and has provided side support for the implementation of this year's major production increase plan. Recently, the Vice Minister expressed his feelings about the inspection as follows: "In order to develop an industry in each region, whether it is to develop an iron mountain or build a factory, political, economic, and cultural aspects must be included in the comprehensive policy, and it must be promoted with a comprehensive and long-lasting force. Furthermore, because various undertakings are being implemented in China, attention must be paid to how to enable Sino-Japanese cooperation to fulfill the plan. Therefore, whether it is a labor problem or a company problem, if the industrial management method is promoted in China in the Japanese style, it will not only produce harm but will be ineffective. On this point, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions. For example, when building a factory, the relationship between the factory and the residents near the factory must be considered. Some companies paid attention to this a year ago, so they have achieved good results. In addition, it is necessary to deeply reflect on the policies implemented in China. Secondly, do not be impatient. If the cooperation between China and Japan is not smooth, then you must take responsibility for resolving it. In this way, we encourage each other and take responsibility. Military officers and civilians must work together and move forward bravely. Furthermore, people in Japan must deeply trust the staff working abroad and allow them to proceed freely in everything. At present, military officers and civilians in all regions are cooperating to increase the production of important materials. For this, the Japanese people must express deep respect and gratitude."</p>

However, this does not include the funds lent by the general public in India to the U.S. military. From March 1941 to February of this year, the total amount of India's lending to the U.S. has reached $149,512,000.</p>

<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – During the extremely short period of national construction, the Myanmar National Army has now trained a large number of elite high-射炮 troops, motorcades, communication units, and other modern mechanized units, and has successively compiled programs. At present, it is jointly protecting the western part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with the Japanese army. Major General Aung San, the head of the Myanmar National Army, met with a group of Japanese reporters on the 6th and explained the Myanmar army's fighting situation in India and attacking enemy airborne troops. He also expressed his confidence in continuing to defend the country with the Japanese army as follows: "Sergeant First Class Ya Na Yin reported on the situation of the battle with enemy airborne troops in the Assam area. He stated that in a certain battle, the number of enemy soldiers killed was several times greater than that of friendly forces. The enemy suffered such heavy losses with excellent equipment because they were focused on defense and did not know the friendly forces' advancing formation. The training methods of the British and Americans mainly rely on elite personnel and material quantities to maintain safety, while the training of the Myanmar army is to cultivate combat spirit and bravely attack. The British and Americans claim to be familiar with jungle tactics in this operation, but they still cannot abandon the luxury of airborne troops supplying food. The primary task of the Myanmar army is to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to complete this important mission, we will fully exert our power and cooperate with the Japanese army to engage in jungle warfare and devote all our efforts to annihilate enemy airborne troops. Whether the tasks assigned to us are achieved can be known from the results of the battle. In the future, we plan to actively expand the ranks of the army."</p>

<h3 id="e13">National Government's Declaration of War <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared that it would share the hardships with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has launched the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the United Kingdom and the United States continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even luring Yu's elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front and send troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the friendly nation of Japan, and the base for their aggression in East Asia has been lost, they have increasingly resorted to cunning schemes. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area and have instigated Yu's elements to constantly harass it in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects. They have even used their own aircraft, based on Yu's area, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. Yu's elements willingly accept the orders of the United Kingdom and the United States and act as traitors to East Asia, which is certainly shameful. The United Kingdom and the United States have been scheming against East Asia, doing their utmost to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which should be resisted by all East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to eliminate the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same mind for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should work together to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for several years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of the Founding Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of trust, peace, and harmony in the entire world are all closely linked to this. We must be of one heart and one mind, strive to the end, and persevere to the end in order to fulfill the great mission of this great era!</p>

<p>Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The seventh of this month is the anniversary of Chairman Wang's visit to Manchukuo two years ago. Today, witnessing the thriving scene in China and Manchukuo, the future development of Greater East Asia, and the fact that our Chairman Wang, who is recuperating in Tokyo, is gradually recovering his health without medication, reflecting on the past and thinking about the present has a profound meaning. Minister Li, the Foreign Minister of Manchukuo, met with a group of reporters on this day and said: "I remember today two years ago, when His Excellency Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China, visited our country's capital amidst his busy schedule in order to inspect the construction of our country and celebrate the tenth anniversary of our country's founding. As the head of a country, he did not hesitate to travel to visit, which is a great honor for our country. At this time when the sacred war of the liberation of the East Asian nations is progressing steadily, the undertaking of building a new order centered on China, Japan, and Manchukuo has laid an unbreakable foundation. The three countries are overcoming the difficulties and fulfilling our sacred cause based on the great ideal of sharing life and death. The progress of the future is just beginning. Recalling that since the publication of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo on November 30th, the seventh year of Kangde and the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, the two countries have recognized each other. In addition to exchanging prime ministers, I have also visited China in return. Therefore, the friendly relations between our two countries have become closer. In terms of materials, there is also mutual communication. At the same time, Chairman Wang's two visits to Japan have further increased the close relationship between China and Japan. Furthermore, due to the recognition of the National Government by Germany, the United States, and other Axis powers, its international status has become higher, and the national foundation has become more consolidated and progressed day by day. Chairman Wang deserves to be congratulated. I believe that China, Japan, and Manchukuo, working closely together, will surely be able to complete the great undertaking."</p>

<p>Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy's main force in the First War Zone is under attack. Japanese units moving westward towards Dengfeng are constantly encountering mines planted by the enemy along the way. On the morning of the 3rd, at Mamingshan, approximately 13 kilometers west of Mixian, the retreating enemy 85th Army was surrounded. After an artillery barrage and fierce hand-to-hand combat, the entire enemy force was routed. Enemy reinforcements, relying on strong positions at Zhongyue Temple, about 3 kilometers northeast of Dengfeng, and the heights of Xindian, attempted to reverse their decline. Superior forces, jointly composed of the 85th, 9th, and 3rd Armies, launched a counterattack. On the 4th and 5th, the Japanese units bombarded the enemy positions, shattering them. Other Japanese units also discovered enemy-planted mines everywhere. At 7 PM on the 5th, they finally broke into a corner of Zhongyue Temple, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, and completely occupied the enemy position that night. The Japanese unit that breached the enemy's front line in Dengfeng also captured Dengfeng County at 10:20 AM on the 6th and are in hot pursuit of the retreating enemy westward. Bridges along the way have been destroyed by the retreating enemy. The advancing Japanese units continue to move forward relentlessly, overcoming all obstacles, even the flames of burning bridges, and attacking the enemy's rearguard, inflicting a major blow and throwing them into confusion, resulting in significant gains.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the spokesman for the Chongqing National Defense Supreme Council, in a meeting with foreign journalists on the 5th, stated that the Japanese forces advancing westward on the Henan front had reached the outer perimeter of Luoyang, a crucial point on the Longhai Railway. The Japanese objective is to occupy Luoyang, a vital point on the south bank of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway in western Henan Province. After reaching Zhengzhou, the Japanese army split into three routes to directly attack Luoyang. The first route attacked the汜水榮陽 region from the southern end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The second route passed through Mixian Dengfeng, directly south of Zhengzhou. The third route advanced from Xuchang Highway, 90 kilometers south of Zhengzhou, through Xiangcheng suburban counties Linru. Currently, the third route of the Japanese army has occupied areas such as Linru in the suburbs of Xiangcheng County and is continuing to press towards the southern outer perimeter of Luoyang.</p>

<p>A certain location on the Henan Front, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war in Henan has now reached its climax. Tang Enbo's army was pursued into the mountainous areas south of Songshan (5 kilometers from Dengfeng). The Japanese army, since the morning of the 5th, launched a joint air and land annihilation operation, suppressing the Yu army's 13th Army's advance southwestward. Furthermore, in a certain area, they pursued the Yu army's 29th Army, advancing in multiple routes from land towards the north and northwest. Moreover, the Japanese aircraft units have broken through the Yu army's strongest positions and are turning eastward from the vicinity of a certain location, cutting off the Yu army's western retreat and completely blockading the Yu army's southern retreat. Currently, the Japanese army is gradually compressing the large encirclement net from all sides, fiercely attacking Tang Enbo's main force, the 13th Army commanded by Shi Jue, as well as the 15th Army, 29th Army, and reinforcement units, totaling ten divisions, approximately 80,000 men, inflicting a devastating blow on the Yu army. On the other hand, Japanese units, in order to cut off the southwestern retreat of the Yu army's 12th Army's 81st Division (Commander Ge Kaixiang) and the 78th Army's newly formed 43rd Division (Commander Huang Guoshu), advanced westward.

<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Water Conservancy Department of the Construction Ministry has established a special office for the Canal Embankment Spring Repair project and appointed Wang Yimou as the director. Since the start of the project, it has been implemented step by step according to the planned work schedule, and the progress has been excellent. Half of the project has now been completed, and the entire project is expected to be completed in approximately thirty more days.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chief of the Canal Management Preparatory Office, Ru Geng, previously noted that the section from Yunhe Station in Pixian to Huaiyin had shallow water levels, making navigation difficult. Before the overall project to address the root cause could be undertaken, it was necessary to implement two projects in the Pisu section: dredging and building dams, and raising the water level, in order to allow cargo ships of over ten tons to navigate within a short period of time. Therefore, at the beginning of last month, a temporary dredging and storage project office for the Pisu section was established at Yunhe Station, and engineering sections were set up in Pixian and Suqian counties, with engineers concurrently serving as section chiefs to supervise the progress of the project closely. This project commenced on April 11th and was originally scheduled to be completed on May 24th, but since the start of construction, the staff has actively promoted it, resulting in rapid progress. It is reported that the Suqian section is expected to be completed before the 10th of this month, and the Pixian section is expected to be completed before the 15th of this month, ahead of schedule. After completion, cargo ships carrying fourteen tons will be able to pass without hindrance. At that time, the Preparatory Office will request the Executive Yuan to send personnel to inspect and accept the project, in order to ensure thoroughness.</p>

<h3 id="e27">On Countermeasures Against Air Raids <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Nobuhiko Ushiba</p>
<p>When I was in London, I experienced German air raids. After coming to Germany, I experienced British air raids. The experience I gained at that time was that the impact of the initial strike during an air raid is the greatest. Furthermore, if the enemy carries out a reasonably large-scale air raid, the psychological impact is also extremely significant. Initially, due to the destruction of houses, deaths of people and animals, and the outbreak of fires, a certain amount of terror spread, and some confusion was unavoidable. But since the unexpected damage felt at that time was small, the anxiety gradually subsided, and emotions returned to calm.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Endure the Initial Strike <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>If one can endure the initial strike, one will get used to it later. At the same time, as the people's lives gradually adapt to air raids, for example, through the preparation of evacuation of the elderly and children, communal living, and communal cooking, the psychological effect that the enemy aims for is countered by the enemy's hatred of the air raiders becoming even more intense.</p>
<p>Speaking of the air raid countermeasures in England and Germany, due to the differences in methods and national conditions, it is impossible to simply compare them. But the methods adopted by both sides are tailored to their national conditions, and the morale of the people is very high.</p>
<p>First, looking at Germany, countermeasures against enemy air raids were planned long ago. Underground shelters, etc., are constantly being reinforced, and strong shelters are constructed with steel bars. But the true awareness of the horror of air raids came after the Hamburg air raid last year. Since then, newspapers have often emphasized the strengthening of air defense. Prior to this, although Germany also advised people to evacuate, it had not been thoroughly implemented. Since the August 1st announcements of evacuation in Berlin and Hamburg, although they suffered such large-scale bombings, the proportion of damage was extremely small. At that time, about one million citizens were evacuated from Berlin, which was quite thorough. The method of evacuation was not based on family units, but rather using group evacuation. This is trained by the Labor Service Corps, so it is different from Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Food is More Important Than Everything <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The most important aspects of air raid countermeasures are the food supply and transportation issues. When a reasonably large-scale air raid occurs, transportation facilities such as trams and trains generally have to be stopped. Especially trams, when they are damaged, are very difficult to repair. As for trains, even if the station is restored quickly, it still takes a considerable amount of time. As a result, the transport of evacuees and repair materials cannot avoid using trucks and buses. If these are not sufficiently prepared in advance, all the functions of the city will cease. Furthermore, this preparation must be a unified plan and cannot be carried out independently, in order to fully exert the transportation capacity. If this preparation is not thorough, no matter how much food or material there is, it cannot be utilized. On these points, Germany, with the Nazi Party as the main body, is extremely well organized.</p>
<p>For general air raid countermeasures, Germany, like Japan, adopts a neighborhood association (bao-jia) system. This is because during an air raid, the police and fire departments have no time to attend to everything, and one must take care of oneself. Firefighting equipment will naturally not include large equipment; the main things are water and sand.</p>
<p>In urban bombings, incendiary bombs are probably the most numerous, so the losses from fires are also the greatest. Moreover, when incendiary bombs are dropped, they are always mixed with explosive bombs. The main purpose of the explosive bombs is not to destroy houses, but to prevent citizens from fighting the fire. However, if one does not risk extinguishing the fire when the bombs fall, it immediately turns into a major fire. On this point, the German people are extremely brave.</p>
<p>Without food and shelter, people will ultimately panic. If people do not drink, eat, and sleep, no matter what, you cannot ask them to work. Once one is hit by an air raid, no matter how well-prepared the air raid countermeasures are, some damage is unavoidable. This phenomenon is inevitable, so if one does not think about the after-effects and does not have complete preparedness, any air raid countermeasures are meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Thoroughly Plan Firefighting Methods <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a fire caused by an air raid, with the current level of air defense, it is not easy to extinguish the fire. From this point of view, it is even more necessary to fully consider the situation after the air raid and make greater efforts and preparations. For example, the minimum amount of repair materials such as roof tiles and door panels for houses is absolutely necessary. Some houses that can be used after repairing the tiles cannot be used because they lack tiles.</p>
<p>Looking at Japan, the scale is different, and the nature of the buildings is also different, so there is no need to be so worried and afraid of the damage caused by bombings. However, because there are many wooden buildings, one cannot but thoroughly plan and implement complete firefighting methods. Furthermore, measures for disaster victims, such as the repair of partially damaged and partially burned houses, should also be fully considered.</p>
<p>In terms of national character, the Japanese are rich in the concepts of discipline and obligation. Not to mention the British and Americans, even the Germans cannot compare. Therefore, even if they are repeatedly bombed, the morale of the people will not be demoralized. Even if tens of thousands of people lose their homes in one night, they will find ways to settle down. Regarding issues such as security, food, and transportation, even if they suffer great damage, they will not cause any anxiety.</p>
<h3 id="e31">No Need to be Apprehensive <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>As the war situation becomes increasingly tense and fierce, some people seem to be very afraid of the arrival of air raids. However, there is no need to be apprehensive. If air defense facilities can be improved, the elderly and children who should be evacuated should be evacuated as soon as possible, and if there is full preparation for enemy aircraft attacks, there is no need to become neurotic due to air raids. In short, the four words "careful and bold" are also the most suitable for air raid countermeasures. (Xiang: Translated from the weekly magazine of March 19)</p>

<p>Today (9th) is the "Fifth Air Defense Day." Air defense drills are being held in all districts of the city, and the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has stipulated that emphasis be placed on evacuation and awaiting evacuation as the main subjects, and the three training points of "pre-emptive evacuation," emergency evacuation, and preparing to take shelter are implemented. The number of participants must be based on detailed training beforehand, with the spirit of responding to everything as if actually encountering an air raid, in order to be skilled, courageous, and agile. At the same time, in order to give each protection corps the opportunity to learn from each other, personnel are dispatched to observe each other. However, when inspecting in the field, smoking, talking loudly, and standing idly by are absolutely prohibited. Furthermore, during this exercise, trainees who have already received training will serve as instructors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to strengthen the organization of special protection corps, the Naval and Air Force Air Defense Headquarters and the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch personnel to inspect tall buildings and factories, in addition to the training of ordinary protection corps. All special protection corps of relevant groups should prepare everything. Furthermore, each protection corps should rigorously check air defense equipment to avoid negligence and injuries during the exercise. Furthermore, in order to strengthen the capabilities of the special protection corps of factories and buildings, in addition to the ordinary training implemented today, imaginary bombs or incendiary bombs will be thrown at high-rise structures. It is hoped that the public will prepare quickly to ensure safety.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth - Date Not Yet Confirmed - Nantong Preparing Cotton Cloth Rationing <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The date for the temporary rationing and sale of cotton cloth in this city has not yet been determined. Now that summer has arrived, the public is eagerly awaiting distribution. A reporter inquired about this matter with the Commercial Control Committee yesterday and learned that the cloth purchase certificates for citizens have already been printed in full. The city government has also been requested to receive and distribute them, and preparations are being made to issue a public announcement on a scheduled basis to implement the sale. In order to clarify the cloth purchase procedures for city residents, the committee has also printed a "Special Issue on Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing," including the street announcements approved by the city government, along with the "Temporary Rationing Measures," "Citizen's Guide to Buying Cloth," "List of Retailer Addresses and Numbers," and "Cotton Cloth Retail Price List," and will distribute them along with the newspaper as soon as the rationing begins. The date to be included in the aforementioned announcement has been requested from the city government by the committee for inclusion in the announcement.</p>
<p>After the implementation of cotton cloth purchases, the public's demand is urgent.

It is learned that the Nantong district government is responsible for handling the rationing matters and is actively preparing. Once ready, the distribution of purchase certificates will be initiated universally.</p>

<p>The Bank of Communications has been handling agricultural loans in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces under orders for over a year, with very smooth implementation. Considering that the spring plowing has already begun this year, and farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai have a great need for funds, in order to support the development of agriculture and increase production, the bank has specially established agricultural loans for Baoshan, Jiading, Nanhui, Juxian, Chuansha, Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu counties and districts of Shanghai starting from the 1st of this month. All agricultural loan affairs in the aforementioned areas previously accepted by the bank will be transferred to this department for continued handling. It is understood that the department, in accordance with the instructions of the head office, has begun handling two types of loan businesses: strict village production increase and agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry enterprises, including: (A) Rural production increase loans, divided into: loans to individual farmers and loans to production cooperatives; (B) Agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry enterprise loans, divided into: loans to various farms, loans to various livestock farms, loans to various beekeeping farms, and loans to various silkworm breeding farms.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shanghai West Shanty Towns Collect Housing Donation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Ordinary citizens in Shanghai often lose their housing donation receipts and are not very clear about the procedures for reissuing them, which affects their household ration. The inquirer specifically consulted the relevant authorities about this matter. It is reported that residents who have lost their housing donation tickets can apply for a replacement by submitting a letter. The authorities will send personnel to investigate and verify the situation, and a replacement will be issued immediately. Currently, due to the high price of paper, a handling fee will be charged appropriately. The collection method is as follows: For every 100 yuan of housing donation, a fee of 10 yuan will be charged, with an additional 5 yuan for each additional 100 yuan, up to a maximum of 50 yuan. No other fees will be charged. As for the general residents of the newly merged districts in Shanghai West, when paying the housing donation, they must pay the outstanding donation fees from before the winter of the previous year. Outsiders who do not understand the situation may suspect that extra fees are being charged, which is actually inaccurate. Those who have already paid off the previous year's housing donation do not need to pay more. In addition, regarding the shanty towns in Shanghai West, there has been no household registration or rationing in the past, and most of the residents are poor and do not pay much attention to the housing donation. Recently, because the authorities have household registration and rationing, they have been requesting to reissue housing donation tickets. In order to care for the general Tang households, the authorities have specially sent people to each cooperative household area to make a comprehensive estimate. Because most of the shanty town houses are simple, the housing donation is collected based on the number of rooms, with a donation fee of 6 yuan collected for each shanty town room, and more if there are more rooms, without any extra charges. It is reported that the authorities have issued more than 11,000 substitute donation tickets based on the request of the shanty town residents, in order to facilitate the citizens to obtain household rationing tickets. People are still being sent to handle this matter. A small number of residents who have not yet obtained the tickets can apply to the Housing Donation Section of the Finance Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road by submitting a letter.</p>

It has recently been learned that the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Business Administration Commission, stating that bean cake and rapeseed cake are made from miscellaneous grains and vegetables, and cottonseed cake is also a similar item, which is not inconsistent with the tax exemption regulations, and should be exempted from consumption special tax. The Business Administration Commission has conveyed this to the Edible Oil Industry Joint Association for reference and compliance, and has also instructed its members to be informed.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Talking about Purchase Prices <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that the control authorities are actively studying the adjustment of the purchase prices of rice, wheat, and cotton in order to meet the living standards of farmers. It was decided to implement it when the new goods are on the market this year. Increasing the purchase prices of agricultural products is a consistent advocacy of enlightened people in the economic circle, and no one is willing to agree with the suicidal policy of suppressing the purchase prices of agricultural products.</p>
<p>If the purchase price is not adjusted, its impact will be limited to two aspects in the short term: it will affect the current purchase work and it will affect the living problems of farmers. However, in the long term, there are at least two aspects: the gradual reduction of major materials and the gradual tightening of urban silver. Why are major materials decreasing? Farmers, seeing that there is no profit in planting rice and cotton, are changing to other crops. For example, in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas near Shanghai, rice is still ranked first, but soybeans and rapeseed have risen to first and third place, while wheat and cotton have fallen to fourth and fifth place. Why is urban silver tightened? Because of the weakness of farmers' buying power, urban manufactured goods cannot flow to the villages in large quantities, thus making the funds stranded in the countryside unable to flow back to the cities in large quantities, which has become one of the many factors that tighten urban silver.</p>
<p>Now that the adjustment of purchase prices is being actively studied, we believe that the Rice, Cotton, and Flour Wheat Committee will pay attention to the following two key points when studying and implementing the adjustment plan: No coercive methods should be adopted. On the one hand, it should be based on meeting the living standards of farmers, and on the other hand, it should be based on meeting the hopes of farmers. There should be no more embezzlement. The farmers and the farmers should not tolerate embezzlement, and the officials between the farmers and the authorities should not tolerate embezzlement. Otherwise, the benefits after raising the purchase price may still not belong entirely to the vast majority of farmers!</p>

<p>Minister Matsudaira Jozai of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, at the regular press conference yesterday (8th) afternoon at 3:00 pm, expressed his thoughts on the release of Gandhi by the British Indian government as follows:</p>
<p>Detained for More Than Two Years</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira first stated: The British Indian government suddenly detained Gandhi and the leaders of the Indian Independence National Congress on August 9th two years ago, and it has been more than two years since then. This time, on the 6th of this month, the British Indian government suddenly issued a statement, citing health considerations, and unconditionally released Gandhi. The reason why Gandhi and the National Congress were arrested and imprisoned was that on August 7th of the previous year, the Indian Independence National Congress held a meeting in Bombay and decided: The British forces should immediately withdraw from India; the Indian Federal Government should be established; and war countermeasures should be decided. If the British refused to accept the above items, all the people of India would start a disobedience movement under the leadership of Gandhi. Unexpectedly, two days later, the Indian National Congress was arrested by the British Indian government. After that, the British government instigated Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing to go to India in an attempt to ease the independence intention of the National Congress. As a result, the Indian National Independence Movement became increasingly turbulent. Finally, the British Indian government resolutely adopted force to suppress the freedom of the National Congress.</p>
<p>The Independence Movement Did Not Stop</p>
<p>When the news of Gandhi's imprisonment and the loss of freedom of the leaders of the National Congress reached Chongqing, Chongqing actually prohibited various gangs from publishing this news. The local opinion in Chongqing was in an uproar, and the Chongqing regime was severely criticized for taking this measure. Therefore, Chongqing had great difficulty in dealing with the Indian issue. Gandhi's wife was imprisoned and died in prison a month ago. In addition, according to the statement issued by Indian Affairs Minister Amery on November 1st last year, it is said that 15,761 important members of the Indian National Congress were imprisoned in prisons, and 7,267 people were deprived of their freedom and were being monitored. From this, we can see the severe and vicious methods adopted by Britain towards Indian independence. This time, the release of Gandhi by the British Indian government does not, in fact, stop the Indian independence movement. With the majestic advances of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army, the atmosphere of independence in India is more vigorous than before, which is an inevitable fact. Minister Matsudaira finally stated that releasing the detained personnel of the Indian National Congress and completing the independence of India is also one of the goals of liberating the East Asian nations. The two major nations of China and Japan should make further efforts to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Encouraging Farmers to Use Garbage as Fertilizer <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Gui Fu</p>
<p>Recently, garbage in the southern part of Shanghai and western suburbs has piled up like mountains. Over time, it inevitably undergoes decomposition, breeding bacteria and spreading epidemics, which undoubtedly has a significant impact on citizens' health. Moreover, as the weather gets warmer, bacteria will easily multiply, and the spread of epidemics is feared to become even more rampant. The health authorities in the southern part of the city once organized a charity performance to raise funds for clearing it up. It is clear that garbage disposal is a matter that cannot be delayed. Yesterday (the 3rd), Mr. Ne of the News reported offered a great suggestion, saying that filling the stinky ponds in Xujiahui and other places with garbage, moving the east to supplement the west, is certainly a good method.</p>
<p>However, I believe that using the garbage that accumulates throughout the city every day to fill up the stinky ponds may not be enough in the long run. Discarding it elsewhere would be troublesome and wasteful. Therefore, I propose that the authorities should encourage and reward the people to transport as much garbage as possible to the countryside for use as fertilizer, which is truly the best way to utilize waste. Currently, food is expensive, and fertilizer is also expensive. For example, in my hometown, each person needs to spend more than thirty yuan on fertilizer, and it is difficult to purchase a large amount of fertilizer. As for bean cake fertilizer, each piece costs more than seven hundred yuan. Some farmers are limited by their finances, while others cannot purchase it even if they want to, so fertilization is often insufficient. This naturally leads to reduced production and stimulates price increases, which seriously affects people's livelihoods. Without an adequate amount of fertilizer applied to the fields, expecting increased production is like climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>Before the war, the fertilizers used in my hometown's farmland, in addition to bean cake, fertilizer powder, human waste and garbage, were transported from Shanghai by private boats, which were very cheap. Farmers, except for natural disasters, rarely suffered from poor harvests due to insufficient fertilization. Therefore, in the past, there was little uncultivated land and harvests were abundant. Now, the situation is completely reversed, which shows that the adequacy of fertilization can greatly affect yields. The best way to achieve this is to make full use of waste materials. The amount of garbage generated in Shanghai every day is considerable. This garbage is actually a very good composting fertilizer. When it undergoes chemical reactions, it produces organic matter, which serves as nutrients for plants. According to farmers, it can also improve soil quality and promote plant growth. It is truly cheap and good, and farmers are currently seeking it but cannot find it.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the authorities will encourage farmers to voluntarily transport garbage to the countryside for use as fertilizer. As for the implementation method, the authorities only need to divide Shanghai into several zones and designate certain villages (preferably those near Shanghai) to clear a specific zone (zoning is to prevent disputes). Furthermore, the clearing must be done cleanly before 5:00 AM every day under the guidance of a few sanitation workers. Farmers can organize fertilizer collection and transportation teams based on the baojia system, using carts and boats. In less than ten days, these wastes can be transported to the fields. This is truly a win-win situation. Why not do it? If the authorities adopt and implement this plan, the citizens will be fortunate, and the farmers will be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Can a Corner of the Park Be Designated for Badminton Games? <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper that badminton playing is prohibited in parks. This is a great misfortune for the youth in our city! In this extravagant and decadent city, it is simply impossible for young people to find wholesome recreational activities to engage in during their spare time. They either waste time in theaters or indulge in cafes. Entertainment venues such as dance halls and cabarets can further corrupt the minds and spirits of young people. Now that they enjoy playing badminton, using it to cultivate their minds and bodies and exercise their physique is a very good activity. However, due to the lack of venues, it is understandable that they play badminton in parks. Moreover, badminton is a gentle sport that is unlikely to damage flowers and trees, and it does not take up much space. Therefore, we, the youth, request the authorities to provide a corner in the park specifically for badminton enthusiasts to play. If necessary, some membership fees can be collected. This would truly benefit us young people immensely, and it would also create a popular avenue for sports. It is truly a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to introduce two venues specifically for playing badminton for enthusiasts to inquire about: The first is the Youth Association Fitness Center on Difeng Road (near Haige Road), which is specifically set up for badminton enthusiasts. The membership fee is also affordable, two hundred yuan for a five-month term. You can practice at any time from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The second is the Xiqing Badminton Court, located in the middle section of Zhao Zhujiao Road. The membership fee is one thousand yuan per year, paid in one lump sum. However, you must practice three times before joining, with a fee of thirty yuan per session. I believe there are many other venues as well! Please inform fellow enthusiasts so that they know where to inquire. A badminton enthusiast.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Mourning Mr. Qian Yunhe <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Another Talent Lost in the Literary and Art World</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Bingxun, from Wuxi, Zhejiang Province, changed his name to Yunhe. He had a passion for reviving the country. Early in his career, he presided over the press, staying in Jinling without seeking fame. He constantly devoted his efforts to promoting revolution. Later, he indulged in painting, poetry, and wine, often associating with comrades of the Party and the nation. Since the war, Mr. Qian, along with his wife, grandchildren, and others, resided in Shanghai, making a living by writing and selling calligraphy. He was full of spirit and content. The year before last, Mr. Qian resumed swimming, writing many poems, and his excellent works were widely circulated. Last winter, Mr. Qian and his wife fell ill. This newspaper once reported that Qian Yunhe needed financial assistance due to illness. Unexpectedly, medicine proved ineffective for his wife, and she passed away to the heavenly abode. Mr. Qian turned weakness into strength and recovered his health. However, Mr. Qian mourned his deceased wife deeply, causing his heart to become ill. Doctors were helpless, and he passed away on April 24th, at the age of sixty-six. The sad news spread, and everyone, whether they knew him or not, cried out in unison. Alas! It has only been a short time since the passing of Mrs. Qian, and now Mr. Qian has bid farewell to the world forever. It can be said that they returned to the west together.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Mr. Qian had an inseparable friendship with the poet Zhizhi Jushi for thirty years. Jushi wrote four quatrains in seven-character lines mourning Mr. Qian Yunhe: "We have been destined to meet for thirty years, I admire your wisdom and virtue despite the age gap. Your purity is worthy of a crane in the clouds, leaving only calligraphy and paintings." "Admiring the solitary orchid, you lightly dismissed the carriage, now you become an old master in the world. An endless regret like the flute on the Yangshan, Du Fu's voice wrapped in rain like silk." "Living in seclusion on the sea, your talent is hidden, the elegy for your deceased wife was deeply sad. It is most pitiful that in your old age, you faced hardship, and your Vimalakirti-like sick body eventually broke down." "You are a predecessor in the literary and art world, your morality and writing enlighten future generations. Your son is traveling far and has not returned, and the grief and feelings are truly heartbreaking." I am attaching this short article to inform Mr. Qian's relatives and clansmen.</p>
<p>Using Pig Lung to Treat Heart Pain</p>
<p>After reading the Social Services section of your newspaper a few days ago, Mr. Lu Wenzhong vaguely requested a good remedy for heart pain. The symptoms described were exactly the same as my mother's. I have obtained a remedy from various sources, which I describe below. Although my mother is still trying it, I dare not be arbitrary about its effectiveness. However, taking it according to the recipe is beneficial and harmless, so you might as well give it a try.</p>
<p>Method: Prepare a fresh, healthy pig lung, wash it clean, and peel off the thin layer of skin. First, burn it in a pot (without adding water), then add ten taels of good Shaoxing wine, place it in a medicine pot, and simmer over a low flame for about three or four hours until cooked. Add six taels of rock sugar and simmer for another twenty minutes until fragrant. After ten minutes, take it out and it is ready to eat.</p>
<p>Dosage: Take it twice with wine. Be sure to avoid any meat, and eat another pig lung every three or four days. Eat four in total, and it will never recur. Zhang Shanyang Qiqi. Also, Mr. Qian Qiqiu of Xie Xinghong Timber Shop, No. 14 Yuxing Road, Fujian Road intersection, Nanjing Road, has a unique prescription. Because the preparation procedure is troublesome, it cannot be described in detail in writing. I can only tell you in person. I hope Mr. Lu can see the newspaper and go to contact him.</p>
<p>Children's Concert The Shanghai Conservatory of Music, a private school, is scheduled to hold a children's popular music concert at the Eight Power Youth Association at 5:30 pm on the 12th of this month. The program includes piano performances, all performed by students of the school aged five to fifteen. Tickets are priced at thirty yuan and fifty yuan in two kinds. They are already on pre-sale at the Youth Association and various piano stores. All ticket proceeds will be donated to orphanages.</p>
<p>Lost Citizen's Certificate Yang Bingxing reported losing a citizen's certificate (number 197707). If anyone finds it, please send it to No. 41 Tiancheng Lane, Yingmai Xiyang Road, and there will be a considerable reward.</p>

<p>— Iwata Toyo Hongyang Translation</p>
<p>(Damn it!)</p>
<p>Although he was very frugal, the money he had brought with him melted and disappeared quickly, like a snowman under the sunlight, and there was really no way to resist it.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, everything can be calculated with money, he discovered this crucial point. Although he was deeply disappointed, he also felt terrified in his heart. In a few days, he became a penniless pauper. When he thought about being abandoned on the roadside and dying in a ditch, he couldn't help but tremble with fear.</p>
<p>He thought about writing a letter to his sister. Now, compared to when he first arrived in the capital, his body felt even weaker and more powerless.</p>
<p>At that time, the suicide of his friend, which the number four student at Etajima experienced, was not something that had not entered the heart of Ryu Fu, it wasn't as if he hadn't thought about suicide.</p>
<p>Although he was in such a painful situation, when he heard about the opening of the Imperial Exhibition, he still had the enthusiasm to go to the Ueno Art Museum. He had already visited the Science and Engineering Museum, but the Imperial Exhibition was a first for him.</p>
<p>He paused briefly in front of the exhibition of Japanese calligraphy and then went to the Western painting section, carefully appreciating it. He felt a deep interest in every painting. At the same time, he held a feeling of admiration for all the artists. For example, even if there were paintings he didn't like, the brushwork was always more skillful than his own, so he had no choice but to admire them. While viewing the paintings, he even forgot about himself, forgot about Tokyo, and forgot about the hotel's overdue bill.</p>
<p>(I'm going to have to start working soon!)</p>
<p>His heart was just pounding.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he came to a spacious, bright room. In this place, there were many works by the examiners. There was a large painting surrounded by crowds of people. Standing beside such a large painting, he felt small in comparison.</p>
<p>Looking closely at this large painting, he couldn't see anything new or special about it anywhere. It was a landscape painting of mountains, but in terms of the calm and elegant strokes, and in terms of the skill of the brushwork, it was a painting that everyone praised. On the painting, there was also the seal of the examiners.</p>
<p>Ryufu believed that it was one of his favorite paintings. Looking at the name of the artist, he cried out in his heart.</p>
<p>(It's Mr. Ichiki Tokujiro's work!)</p>
<p>He had known this artist's name for a long time. He graduated from Kagoshima Second Middle School early on, and he was a famous mountain painter both in his hometown and in Tokyo. Ichiki Tokujiro did not fit in with the martial spirit of the Second Middle School, and he looked as if he had come from a school for sculptors or dancers. However, his name was generally recognized as outstanding. Because Ichiki almost never returned to his hometown, Ryufu did not recognize him. This was the first time he had seen his works in person, apart from the three-color reproductions.</p>
