<h3>中日締盟一週年益堅定必勝信念陳代主席谷大使發表談話</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　今日（三十日）爲中日同盟條約簽訂週年紀念日，當此太平洋連戰皆捷，大東亞戰爭邁入決勝階段之時，此具吾人爲實踐盟約，必須加強中日協力，更爲完遂戰爭，尤須發揮吾人之總力。今當締盟週年紀念，我國府陳代主席，特發表談話，闡明紀念意義，示我全國人民，茲錄談話原文如次：　　陳代主席談話　　本月三十日爲中日同盟條約一週年紀念，下月六日，又爲大東亞共同宣言一週年紀念。前者是一掃百年以來中國所受不平等條約束縛之痕跡，完全回復東亞同胞之本來面目。後者是樹立東亞民族獨立自主，共存共榮之基本原則，使東亞各國家民族團結一致，同心協力，以打破英美殖民主義之壓迫與榨取，使東亞各　　國家民族　　依於其各自之本然特質，而確保其生存發達，依於其互尊互助之連鎖關係，而蘄致於共存共榮，兩者精神目的，前後一貫。一年以來，時局之發展，使此條約此宣言之義義，愈覺眞實而可貴。以前者言。不惟國人所焦急之撤兵問題已有具體之解決，即基於辛丑條約之駐兵權，亦因盟邦之誠意而毅然放棄。不惟國人對過去外交文件之疑慮，已由中日　　基本關係　　條約，及其一切附屬文書之失效，而可以雲消霧散，即政治上經濟上有關中國之自由與統一之憂慮，亦因同盟條約之訂立，而可以完全豁除。不惟國人所期望必須回復到蘆溝橋事變以前狀態，方能實現和平者可以做到，且以租界之收回，治外法權之撤廢，駐兵權之放棄，實已超過若干倍，中日兩國正義和平之基石於此已可奠定。復以英美侵略主義者，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，藉中國爲戰塲，而焦土之野心未戢，遂致　　戰爭狀態　　繼續延展，和平統一，末由實現。戰爭非寄托於幻覺的奇蹟可了，和平非僥倖於渺茫的運命可致。歲月蹉跎，曷勝感慨。以後者言，殖民主義之壓迫與榨取，爲東亞民族所不能容忍，則東亞民族之努力以求獨立自主，與共存共衛，自必爲英美殖民主義者所仇視所痛恨。明於此，則大東亞戰爭最後決戰之機愈迫，即英美殖民主義者最後掙扎之情愈苦而愈凶殘，亦即我東亞民族爲自國存亡，爲東亞安危，併其全力，決此一戰之任務愈艱鉅而愈光明。凡對兩者，皆有待於全國民衆，　　積極奮起　　，共相策勵，乃能以犧牲之決心，發揮共同宣言之眞精神，以現實之努力，使同盟條約一字一句，見諸實現。臨此同盟條約及共同宣言一週年紀念之期，正值大東亞戰爭決戰勝利展開之際，吾人除對盟帮日本，援助我國完成獨立自立，領導東亞各國，共求解放之誠意，致申感謝之餘，惟有加倍努力，內則領導民衆，排除障碍，以促進國家之和平統一；外則舉我國力，追隨盟邦，以完遂東亞之神聖戰爭，救中國，保東亞，舍此別無他途。　　日谷大使談話　　南京二十九日中央社電　日駐華大使谷正之氏，爲紀念中日同盟條約簽訂週年，特發表談話如次：今日爲中華民國與日本國簽訂同盟條約週年，以本條約之具有劃一的意義，故實爲中日兩國官民同堪慶賀之一大紀念日。本條約雖僅有極少之數條，但其所規定之內容，不僅在中日兩國，即在大東亞各國家各民族，實亦具有極重要之歷史意義。蓋　　中日兩國　　於本條約中，已明示以相互善隣，尊重其自主獨立，並緊密協力。以建設道義之大東亞，而期貢獻於全世界之和平。且有排除一切障碍禍根之堅強決意。由此兩國各於其本來姿態上，確立永久友好之基礎。並爲大東亞之建設，及確保其安定，而緊密協力，以發揮一切之力量。回顧過去一年中，中日兩國即依照本條約之所定，於互相尊重，互惠平等之基礎上，在軍事政治經濟文化等各方面　　積極協力　　爲擊減侵略東亞之敵人英美，而相與同辛酸共喜樂，日夜精進，不斷努力。故基於道義之兩國緊密的運繫，今已絕不稍有動揺。惟按之今日東亞大勢，英美兩國爲圖實現其制霸東亞之野心。正分於東亞互相呼應，尤其在渝方治下各地。已設定航空基地。並派軍進駐，強化中國領土爲戰塲，並以中國民衆爲犧牲，着着使中國陷於殖民地化。是以目前之戰局，實已益趨　　重大階段　　當此台灣及菲島方面，獲舉擊減敵美艦隊之偉大戰果之時，中日兩國之得以達成共同使命，已愈益顯著，此實深堪感慰者。於此紀念今日之中日同盟條約簽訂週年。實覺有更深長之意義，今當同盟條約週年紀念，謹祝中日兩國之前途光途，並望兩國之前途光榮，並望兩國隨戰局之進展，更加緊密提携，一新堅強之決意，以努力達成本條約之崇高目的。</p>
<h3>巴莫電菲總統激勵作戰</h3>
<p>仰光二十九日中央社電　緬甸國家代表巴莫氏，二十五日向菲共和國大總統洛勒爾發表聲明，鼓勵決戰塲中之菲律賓，原文如次：洛勒爾大總統閣下，敵軍爲獲得菲律賓之立足點，現正猛攻，際此激戰時期，本人代表緬甸全體向大總統閣下，作同情之援助，吾等緬人，十分理解菲律賓之負擔，對敵軍龐大物力資源作猛烈進攻，緬甸亦會長期抵抗敵軍野蠻之進攻，然吾等所具東亞人之意志，卒未被打破。相信菲律賓同志，在此戰爭中，必能與全東亞共同存亡，菲律賓及緬甸將毅然固守其堡壘　　朝日新聞社特派記者衣奈氏最近會視察西部戰綫，所獲印象，覺得應該警戒的敵勢力，實在於北方，尤以空挺部隊侵入荷蘭方面的形勢最堪重視。下面西部前綫的情勢：　　西部要塞或許不能說是可以阻擋敵方壓倒的物量之強力要塞，但以德國本土爲舞台的最後一綫，則除戰車壕及要塞設備以外，德國民衆的防衛陣，英美實不能不加以考慮。其結果，攻擊的重心，極度愼重，避免西部要塞綫，選擇從比利時荷蘭一帶。此在英美的戰術是常套。如果說亞琛不能突破，戰爭尚止於德國的外廓地帶，則不發生眞正的侵入德國本土的戰事。　　英美會宣傳由於法國占領以後的繼續追擊德軍，由於德國敗軍的混亂，德國的投降即歐戰的告終時期，將出於意外地快。阿亭的敵空挺部隊殲滅戰，在這一戰上，給與極大的打擊，表示出德國的戰意，一反敵人的預料，極爲國土防衛態勢，不僅是地理上的，即要塞綫的防禦，而且也是機動的防禦。德軍在法亞境的伐朗許，法萊斯二戰役的敗續，此役實爲其雪辱戰，爲德國開始決戰的表示，而振奮了全軍的士氣。　　德法再度協力　　在德國視爲這是不久即將好轉的朕兆。這雖不能輕率地說是前途樂觀的材料，但德國賴此一擊，確已獲得了敵人闖至眞正的最後一綫的餘裕。就敵英美而言，在德國所企圖的可怖的攻擊開始之前，德國多得一分防衛的[時間]，尤甚於切膚之痛。依恃物量的戰爭，如果不能實現毫無　滯地專取柏林的美夢，物量的優勢，未必能獲舉決定的戰果。與北方戰區的勝利相呼應，在南方，奪回法國之政治的反攻，也已開始了。從巴黎，從維希撤退的法國的對德協力派政客，計劃奪還祖國的方策，付諸行動的時期已到了。一時因西部戰綫的緊張，雙方似已忘却了這問題，自從巴黎陷落以後，法國已從世界的視野中脫落了，今則突然對特古爾派及共產系的陣綫開始攻擊。[德法協力]，一時又盛囂塵上，現在想來，貝當元帥，賴伐爾首相應德國的增聘，移居法國東部，在德國實是一次偉大的勝利。在立法上是正式的法國主席，在實際上能籠絡四千萬法國人民的人物，舍貝當元帥外無第二人。　　失掉了貝當元帥的英美占領地帶，即使是巴黎政治運營也不圓活地進行。一般市民的生活，則依然被閉銷於不安的黑暗中。特戈爾派與共產系分子的傾軋，以整個法國爲舞台而漸次激化的傾向，雖在片斷的情報中亦顯得很明白。共產黨員占領的佐爾，宣言爲英美占領後最初的蘇維埃區，特戈爾大爲狠狽，巴黎的軍政長官開尼希，拒絕要求解除特戈爾分子的武裝，而赴倫敦商議，此種事實，說明了法國混沌的情勢。　　希特勒的聲明　　關於貝當元帥與賴伐爾政府的轉移，敵方會宣傳這些人已成爲德國的俘虞，或說被幽禁，但在地域上因法國全境幾被英美所蹂躪，故事實上的行政地域沒有了，施行政務的對象也沒有了，法政府自然祇有袖手傍觀，以待局勢的澄清。但隨着情勢的發展，法政府已編成德法協力委員會，法政府對德全權不管部長在勃里農大使改爲對德全權，其下有維持治安總監達爾南氏爲法義勇軍委員，勃里特將軍爲俘虐關係委員，勞働福利部長狄亞氏爲法勞働者問題委員，又東法在新聞關係上與我協力的呂西爾氏就任宣傳部長之要職，各担任對德軍務的推行。　　宣言對法戰綫的英美軍與特戈爾派或共產黨員門爭，用報紙無綫電展開激烈攻勢的前衛基地，已經越過萊因河而進出於前綫。勃里農，達爾南，狄亞三委員最近與希元首會見，即爲此政治的逆襲之出發點。微聞此次會談中希特勒首向法方具體的詳細作戰計劃，關於以前的軍事情勢，也獲得完全的諒解，堅持打破英美勢力，以奪回首都巴黎爲目標而堂堂出發。　　法國的山河雖已破碎，但德國尚殘留着一百萬法人勞働者與一百萬法兵俘虜，將來結集這二百萬人的力量，策動奪回祖國，不是難事。暫時侷處斗室的貝當主席，近來也精神振奮，每晨外出散步，悠閒自在對祖國前途極抱樂觀。這可說明法國的將來實有光明的前途。（譯自十月二日朝日新聞）社評</p>
<h3>中日同盟一週年</h3>
<p>去年今日，中日兩國於南京簽訂同盟條約，如今整整一年了。我們翻開同盟條約的全文，讀了一遍。同時，我們檢討一年以來中日兩國間的關係，以及大東亞的一般情勢，不無深長的感觸，爰就所見，申述如次。　　締結同盟條約，是基於兩國之間共同的客觀要求。自從二十九年十一月簽訂基本條約以後，兩國關係進入新階段，迨大東亞戰爭爆發，以至國民政府參戰，日本實施對華新政策以後，兩國之間的客觀要求，完全一致，所以，進一步簽訂同盟條約。但是，我們認爲如何以同盟的精神，協力完成共同的要求，才是積極的實現同盟條約的方針。　　什麼是共同的要求呢？當然是爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利。現在日本方面早已動員一憶人民的全力，擊滅英美，尤其是這次台灣與菲島海戰的大捷，奠定了大東亞戰爭勝利的基礎。從狹義而言，這是日本方面對我們已經盡了同盟國的一部分責任。在中國國民政府而言，對於同盟條約中若干部分，須待全面和平恢復戰爭狀態終了時，纔能全部調整。所以全面和平的實現，一方面是增強爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的保證，一方面又是完全恢復中日正常關係的條件。可是，依照目前的情勢，我們與其空談實現全面和平，不如先在和平區內，從革新政治入手，使政治上軌道，治安確立，民生安定，必須以這種事實表現，爭取重慶統治下的人民，心響來歸，到了這個時候，不求全面和平也會實現了。不過，一年以來，對於這方面努力，如何值得當局的反省？就是退一步言，根據同盟條約的換文所示，在戰時狀態繼續中，也可以按情形所許，隨時由兩國協議，加以調整。所以，目前雖有重慶拖戰的事實存在，我們仍可在政治經濟方面的刷新求進，依據條約精神，局部調整。這在一年以來的努力又如何？也值得中日當局的反省。　　其次，我們尤須明瞭同盟條約是由基本條約修正簽定的，當時修正的決意，以及同盟條約曁議定書換文等均由日本政府自動提出的。爲什麼日本政府願意提出互尊互惠的修正條約呢？當然是表示對中國親善合作的誠意，是實施對華新政策以後的具體表現。不過，一年以來的努力，雖巳有了種種事實，爲了促進兩國之間更加協力，這應目前最緊要的情勢，爭取大東亞戰爭的決戰勝利起見，我們同時希望盟邦對華新政策更能一步一步的推進，一步一步的具體實現。　　最後，我們促起醉心英美者可以從此警醒，這次大陸戰爭中，河南湘桂之戰，洛陽長沙衡陽的失陷，桂林危急，以及台灣菲島海戰的屢戰屢敗，已經充分暴露英美的無足依賴。對於大東亞主義，更應加強信念。努力本位工作，協力政府，督促政府，完成共同要求，實現同盟條約。</p>
<h3>泰國努力完成鐵壁防衛態勢</h3>
<p>協力大東亞解放戰爭　　盤谷二十九日中央社電　泰國自開戰後即，在擊滅英美之旗幟下，本諸日泰同盟從事大東亞之解放戰爭。自阿巴溫內閣成立後，即表明日泰協力·共同完遂戰爭及防衛國土之決意，組閣以來，整備國內態勢，積極建設國軍，集結國內總力，努力確立強力之國家防衛態勢，實施決戰內閣適當之各種，施策首先調整國防軍之首腦陣容。繼之泰政府於九月初旬制定國防會議法，設置國防會議，議長由外長·國防軍總指揮官·副總指揮官·國防軍參謀總長·陸海軍參謀長及政府推薦委員五名組織而成，由首相任國防會議委員長。該法第五條規定，國防會議對國內及國際間之軍事·經濟·政治及國民安寗·防衛國土問題，均有審議之任務，並自遂行與完遂戰爭有關係事業之權限，此係與日本最高戰爭指導會議具有同一性格者。一方雨季過後，爲防備敵機空襲及實施各種防空對策，首先新設國土防空司令部，由夏特紐達拉克國防次長兼任司令官，並將畢本內閣時代由內衛部移管國防部之防空局，仍歸國防部管辖，俾迅速傳達情報命令。一方對盤谷及其他各都會之市鎭，除婦孺外，一律使從事日常事務，工廠公司等則組織防獲團，期空襲時之救護防火得以萬全。同時泰國日駐軍，亦積極援助泰國之防衛，尤以防空爲最，每當敵機來襲，日·泰軍民必緊密協力擊滅敵機，刻已完成鐵壁之防衛態勢。</p>
<h3>日泰文協紀念小磯首相祝電</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日小磯首相以二十八日爲日泰文化協定締結二週年紀念，特於是日向泰首相阿巴溫致電如次：日泰文化協定之締結協定，在藉兩國間自古以來存在之精神上文化上乃至宗教上之類似接近，使兩國友好關係更加助長增進，此實爲吾人所深慶者。今日當此大東亞戰爭方酣之時，吾人更相信兩國國民精神上之協力，必將因該協定之締結，而成爲突破今後難局之推進力，吾人於此，除以文化院總裁資格，對閣下過去之盡瘁表明謝意外，並切盼閣下今後能作更進一步之努力。</p>
<h3>大東亞各地一週間戰況</h3>
<p>日空軍再襲成都機塲　　東京二十九日中央社電　週間戰況如次：一日本土西部方面，二十五日敵B２９型機約百架，來襲九州各地及濟州島，以謀切斷日軍對菲律賓方面之接濟，卒被日制空部隊擊落擊毀其二十四架。又駐華日航空部隊二十六日會追擊至成都，擊毀共五十七架，使來襲敵機泰半歸於潰滅·二中國方面，日軍對桂林柳州地區之作戰，仍在順利進行中。三緬甸方面，本月上旬以來，敵機在緬甸全城，作積極之活動，十八日以來，仰光地區日軍迎擊之戰果，計擊落敵機十七架（內六架不確），擊毀敵機十四架。又英軍由印度洋方面呼應菲律賓作戰之行動，亦漸行活潑。四帛琉方面，培里琉島日軍仍確保中央高地，奮勇作戰，其在安格維而島方面者，亦正確保西北角地區從事力戰。摩羅塞方面之日軍，則繼續作肉搏戰，收獲極大戰果，使敵軍無法建設并利用飛機塲。五菲律賓方面，雷伊泰島之敵約一師，達拉庫之敵約二師，從事迎擊邀擊，刻仍在展開激烈之陸上作戰中。日航空部隊亦仍在充分發揮其拚撞之精神，不分晝夜，攻擊灣內敵艦船羣，收獲極大之戰果中。　　中國大陸前綫基地二十八日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，爲膺懲二十五日空襲九州，及濟州島之美空軍駐渝轟炸隊，乃於二十六日夜冒惡劣天氣，第四次強襲成都機塲，已收獲偉大戰果。計炸毀敵機共六十架，是夜敵精銳轟炸機之大編隊，對B２９型機憇息地成都機塲，加以報復痛擊，使配置分散於成都機塲之B２９型機，相繼焚毀，陸上施設約近十處起炸焚燒，照耀儼如白晝。於大滑走路南方之B２９機羣全部中彈，此外另一攻擊隊亦於該飛機塲西南，以敵B２９型機翼在月，投下無數炸彈。中彈起火者二處，對在西北方停放之B２９型機，施以猛炸燃燒。</p>

<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據德官方戰報發表：荷境之激戰已擴大至些耳德河口，與赫陀根波什之間之全部地區，卑爾根Bergen之戰事尤烈，該地敵軍於坦克直支援下所發動之迭次攻勢，均被擊破，迤東之蒂爾堡（Tilberg）已於激戰後落入敵手。　　柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍在些耳德橋頭與貝維蘭南部之地位，雖益感困難，但反軸心軍尚被封鎖於安特衛普港之外，此爲德軍司令部之最大成功。該港之守軍雖在困難局勢之下，仍將繼續抵抗。此項困難局勢之造成，由於反軸心軍增強貝維蘭東南部橋頭之實力，與加拿大軍在該地峽西部之進展。惟德軍之力量仍屬雄厚，反軸心軍如欲進展，必須償付重大之代價。加拿大第一軍進攻勃拉本特西北，已進迫羅遜得爾，惟向布萊達進攻之敵軍，則毫無進展。蒙高茂萊將軍作戰之重心，目前在英軍第二軍之左翼，該軍沿蒂爾堡·赫陀根波什之綫，同西北與西方推進，以圖驅逐德軍至海岸，英軍於告成後業已抵達蒂爾堡。德軍生力軍在該城以北與西北，抵禦英軍坦克車隊之前進，現該區之局勢尚未穩定。德軍自繆斯河橋頭溫洛以西向黑爾蒙特與米吉爾方面，對英軍第二軍之右翼作堅強之反攻，英軍出於不備，不得不放棄若干土地。亞琛區之局勢仍無變化。反軸心軍開始在奧維爾與佛日中部作局部之斥堠活動，足見美第三軍之部署業已完畢，即將發動總攻。美第七軍於星期五繼續在佛日西部，對聖第與吉拉特米爾施壓力，惟無重要之成就。</p>

<h3>亞省渝共軍又起衝突</h3>
<p>廣州二十九日中央社電　渝政權於二十六日發表重大聲明，謂對峙之渝共兩軍已在晉省一角開火，兩政權之和協陷入絕望狀態。是日渝政權發言人張平羣會見新聞記者團，更說明渝共兩軍交戰詳情如次：第二戰區司令長官閻錫山，最近會見該問西北地區之中外記者團，就共黨問題披瀝意見後，彼即爲延安機關報[解放日報，]及太岳軍區司令傳一波等共軍將校所濫詞污衊，太岳軍區司令傳一波，竟於八月下旬，公然對臨汾東方約三十公里塔山之渝第六十一軍加以攻擊，當被擊退。九月上旬，共軍第二百十·第二百十二·第二百十三·第三百八十五·第三百八十六各旅團，結爲四個大隊，而於九月八日上午十時，再度攻擊第六十一軍。此外共軍機動部隊，更沿同浦鐵道由平遙臨汾各方面夾攻，於是浮山北方渝第七十二師團，遂因共軍之優勢，不得已向西南方嫁却云。</p>

<h3>菲島雷伊泰灣內日機猛襲敵艦艇塔克羅班殘敵正在掃蕩中</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十九日中央社電　雷伊泰之日美攻防戰之激烈，與日俱增，企圖奪回制空權之敵軍，出動運輸艦數十艘赴雷伊泰灣內，力謀增強後方之接濟。同時更急謀使用已佔領之塔克羅班及達拉庫兩機塲，使艦載機陸上機進駐，其中七十架已遭逢全滅之打擊，敵軍後方并積極從事空輸工作。另一方面集中戰車，進窺桑巴布羅機塲·南方之失羅亨南北兩機塲，目下雙方正展開熾烈之爭奪戰。該島日軍確保西方高地，且以少數兵力繼續進襲塔克羅班南方之敵軍後陣地。敵軍爲奪取達拉庫及夫羅亨機塲附近之控制權，刻下戰局之重點，已至該市南方。　　馬尼刺二十九日中央社電　日航空部隊二十七日仍在雷伊泰島方面大舉活動，對殘存於灣內之敵艦船·登陸用舟艇·及敵軍佔領下之飛行塲繼續猛攻，自二十六日夜至二十七日正午所獲業經判明之戰果如次：擊毀敵運輸船一艘·驅逐艦五艘，炸毀敵運輸船一艘，擊落敵機二架　　馬尼刺二十九日中央社電　敵軍以日機隊之不斷猛攻，已蒙重創故數日來敵機來襲次數已頓減少。二十七日來襲菲律賓各地之敵艦上機僅有二百架，陸上機且不足一百架。至二十八日晨更形弛緩，其在巴拉汪島方面，敵機來襲僅有二次，第一次僅大型機十四架，第二次僅有二十三架而已。其在比薩雅方面，敵機僅作分散之襲擊，其目的僅在哨戒及偵察而已。　　菲島前綫日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　日神風攻擊隊，由戰鬥機隊組成，爲日本海軍之精髓，一貫採取壯烈戰術，一遇敵機動部隊即決死拼戰。此等決死隊於二十五日開始出動總攻，以冷靜態度駕駛飛機，抱一去不還之決心前往攻擊。頃據其同志談該隊奮戰之詳情，謂第一次特別攻擊隊於伊泰灣東方海面，發現敵機動部隊，當即以飛機二架撞沉中型空母一艘，一架撞毀空母一艘，使其失去航行能力，又撞沉巡洋艦一艘。彼等不顧生死煊赫無畏之精神，實堪效尤。</p>

<h3>台菲日軍奏捷奠定必勝初基</h3>
<p>林宣傳部長發表談話　　南京二十九日中央社電　菲律海戰，盟軍大獲勝利，予敵美以致命打擊，奠定大東亞戰勝之初基。林宣傳部長特爲此發表談話，茲誌原詞如次：日來盟軍於台灣及菲島海面連續獲得空前偉大戰果，捷報頻傳，凡我東亞十億民衆莫不同深感奮。溯自奎比克會議以來，敵美英即決定太平洋採取攻勢，數月來敵美待機蠢動，在大陸則濫施轟炸，肆意焦土，置人道於不顧，在太平洋則集中其殘暴孤軍深入，冒兵家之所忌，近頃於台菲海面狡然思逞，盟軍以逸待勞，把握神機，毅然出擊，對敵部隊既予以重創，對已失海上連絡之雷伊泰島登陸敵軍，更不難集而殲滅之·盟軍此次作戰，在戰略上堪稱已收獲偉大的成功·敵美英還以物質優越自誇，並以此玩弄虛驕宣傳，然事實勝於雄辯，如以爲空軍可以橫衝，則台東一戰何致潰不成軍，如以爲海軍可以制勝，則菲海一戰何致重創之後，幾於不能救援。反之，盟邦將士爲國家爲東亞，不怕艱險，不惜犧牲，其作戰之英勇，眞可謂泣鬼神而動風雨，因爲我東亞十億民衆之所深敬佩，即敵美英亦爲之寒胆。此實東亞民族特具精神之表現，決非如西方膚淺之唯物主義者之能想像，即以物力而較量之，同一實力，用之萬里之外，較之千里之內，其比例之懸殊，實至驚人。準此以觀，則敵美此次敗績，就空間上時間上之補給計之，其作戰能力之損失，至少相當於其數字損失之四倍以上。敵美雖自誇其物力之充裕。然決不能不自承其物力運用之艱困。現在大東亞戰爭正入決戰階段，此次勝利又爲奠定最後勝利之初基，敵美制覇東亞野心未已，孤注一擲捲土重來，自在意料之中。我國爲大東亞之一環與廢存亡息息相關，所望我國同胞東亞全體，一致奮起，加緊淬勵，增強後方生產，增強戰力，與前方將士漸爲一體，握定必勝信念，爭取中國之光明，東亞之解放。</p>

<h3>西山看紅葉</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>每年到了重九佳節的前後，北京西山的楓葉便紅透了半天。記者在前幾天剛巧有一位朋友自上海坐飛機來此，於是一時與來相偕於重九前五日坐車出西直門。從西直門到頤和園有一條柏油的馬路，修築得十分壯觀，所以車行其上舒適異常，尤其回顧北京西郊田野風景頓可感到心胸豁朗。據說這條美麗的柏油路，乃是事變後華北僅有的政績，要不然的話事變前的馬路到現在早就破壞得不堪了，我們只要看看自頤和園至西山，以前原也有一條很好的馬路！可是今日却荒圯得不像樣子。我已經有兩年沒有走這條路了，兩旁的新建設也添了許多，譬如你過了魏家村行近龐家莊的時候，便可見一處高樓大厦，大有滿洲建築的風味，原來這便是華北晨事試騐塲。</p>
<h3>青龍橋訪程艷秋</h3>
<p>過了頤和園便到青龍橋，當時我的一位朋友便提議去看名伶程艷秋。原來程艷秋自大東亞戰後便自戲劇界退隱，和我那位朋友很熟，他自去年以來就在那裹過着隱居的生涯。記者雖對京劇毫無興趣，不過聽我朋友說，現在上海的一般小姐位都學着程氏的京調，可見大有[無腔不程]的景況，我何妨就去看他一看。我們當即在青龍橋鎭上停車而下，向店舖問明了程老板的住宅，才走進一條狹弄而到了那裹三號門牌的門前扣門而入。走進院子，寂靜得很，但見庭院中堆了一塲的黍米，一位老僕帶我們走入上房時，就見門簾動處，程氏笑面而迎。他那時身上只穿着一條黑袴，一件黑的棉短襖，誰見了他眞不知就是紅極一時的名伶程艷秋！記者因爲素不喜京劇，所以也沒有看過他的戲，但也知道他是一位極有戲劇素養的人。他過去與李石會來往甚密，且在故都辦過戲劇月刋，當時很想改良我國的京劇，但這個刋物現在已停刋了，眞料想不到，事變的影響還及於伶人！　　我們談了有半個多鐘頭，因爲限於遊山的時間，未克暢談就此相別。然而在這半個多鐘頭裹，使我也曉得了許多的事情。原來程氏自二年以前就放棄了唱戲的生涯，他最大原因還在於他現在並不需要以唱戲來求溫飽了。他聽到了我說，現在梅蘭芳在滬也不唱戲的話，他便說：[我們現在年齡都大了，而且兒女都已經長成，再幹這頑意，不免有點不好意思吧！何況唱戲的目的不外在裝飽肚子，我們現在旣然不唱戲都可過活，何必再去自討苦吃呢？]　　程氏現在的生活，我當時倒感到十分的同情。他的家還在北京城裹住，他只一個人住在這裹。他每天一早就跑到離此不遠的一個萄葡圃去，據說那個葡萄圃面積有六十多畝大，所以儘可夠他的生活了。他的一個最大的兒子，還在十年前由世界學校遺送至日內瓦，那個時候，讀者也許還可以記得日內瓦國際學院，爲造就未來人才計，由李石會所創辦的世界學校選派了十多個幼年中國兒童到那裹去求學，程氏的長子便是其中之一。據程氏說，他的那位兒子，現在已經二十歲，且已進了日內瓦大學，時間眞是太快了。回想起來，記者在十四年前，也會在日內瓦大學讀過書，萊夢湖的風光至今尚宛然存於目前哩！他還有二個兒子，現在輔仁大學附中讀書，一位小姐在女師高中讀書，都在北京。最後，我們還談到李石會先生，據說他以年近古稀之齡，還在美國和一位德國太太結了婚。笑話便在這裹結束，我們匆匆別出又復登車向前進發。</p>
<h3>耶律楚材別野弔古</h3>
<p>車子到了西山之麓，不能再向前走了。我們便先到附近館子裹去吃午飯，午飯後我們舍車用驢，先到碧雲寺去。提到碧雲寺，今日已可說全國無人不知，因爲在民國十四年國父孫中山之喪，首先即停柩於此。因此這裹今尚留有一個衣冠塚，且有一個留守辦事處，至今看守那個衣冠塚的，還是一位來自羊城的粵人。可是所謂碧雲寺，歷史是很古的。在元時爲耶律楚材的別墅，耶律楚材對於我國是一位極有功的人物，這是今日盡人皆知的史實。據導遊的人說，耶律楚材今不僅爲我國人民所崇拜，而且盟邦人士也很多佩服他的。可見在我國，不論他是否國人，只要對我國有功勳的話，就是一個異邦人也能使我國人民沒世不忘的。按照這裹的石碑碑文所載，碧雲寺乃在耶律楚材之子阿利吉時始捐舍爲寺，到了明代著明閹奸魏忠賢便以此作爲生壙，不料後來魏氏在貴州被殺，未及葬身於此，可知一世奸謀終難如願吧！　　走進碧襲寺門，便見題有[影紅寂照]四個大字，我們先到羅漢堂去參觀，裹面置有五百名金字羅漢，滿屋寫着六個西藏金字，據說那六個字讀音爲[恩毛馬巴尼洪]，意思是等於我們念[南無阿彌陀佛]一樣，碧雲寺寺門之內，先爲石碑，石碑之後爲佛殿，殿中陳列着彌勒佛觀音文殊普賢等菩薩之佛像，佛殿之後始爲正殿，即中山紀念堂，內陳列國父遺像以及棺木模型一具，前面滿置着今年三月十二日國父忌辰所放的國府要人花圈。可是當記者等去參謁時，適逢該紀念堂在重加修葺，所以另把這些陳設移在旁邊一間屋子內放着。中山紀念堂之後，便是衣冠塚，我們會由那位守塚的粵人領導至屋頂，觀音北京全城景色。因爲今天天氣特別晴和，萬里無半點白雲，我笑着對朋友說，眞是青天白日遊西山！　　我的朋友說，在事變以前，碧雲寺和香山，分別在兩位政治家經營之下；李石會經營碧雲寺，熊希齡經營香山。所以在民國初年時，李氏會創辦文化事業於碧雲寺，而熊氏所創辦的慈幼院，却至今猶在香山之麓。可惜我們爲時間所限，未及參觀慈幼院爲憾。</p>
<h3>香山紅葉映雙清</h3>
<p>從碧雲寺出來到香山不十分遠，可是要探訪香山全景却也非易事，所以我們決定仍用騎驢的方法去上山看紅葉吧！上得山來，我們但見楓葉早已紅滿了山頂，正象徵着火的光明一樣。在那裹，到處可以見到過去一般要人或銀行家的別墅。我們先在半山亭坐了一回，然後再到雙清別墅下驢。所謂雙清別墅，原來就是熊希齡夫婦生前休憇之所，但那時熊氏的夫人還是原配的夫人哩。我們走進那個別墅，但見一泓清水正繞着庭院，裹面的金魚浮沉自若。我的朋友乃走上那個院子，裹面也　無一人，靜得像一切都是死的！他不禁感嘆起來，說着：[活的現實，竟一一成爲歷史了]！原來他以前和熊氏是很熟的，熊氏的新夫人毛氏現在滬上還是常見的哩。他問着看屋人的子說：[毛夫人還常來這裹嗎？]那個老頭無精打釆地說：[今春北來過一次，但僅到天津去料理私事，不久就回上海去了。]我的朋友，便在那裹徘徊了好久，默念着：[好一對一個三三，一個六六！]我們於是走過池塘，在院子之北，放着一個長的石桌，配有很多的座位，大槪往年熊氏遊宴之所吧！在那裹掛着一付乾隆御筆的對聯，上面寫着：[翠竹滿庭瞻法相，白雲一塢識宗風，]的是很好的手筆。　　從雙清別墅出來，便到了香山唯一的勝處，這便是我們在畫片上常見的昭廟和見心齊。昭廟現在已被改爲北京大學醫學院附屬醫院香山分院，未免有點殺風景吧！走過昭廟便看見一處有亭臺畫閣之勝，原來所謂見心齊實即清代當時帝王駕臨香山時的行宮，那裹也有一泓清池，池內還留有殘荷，我想在夏天一定是很涼快的。見心齊裹面，清代帝王，尤其乾隆的筆墨遺跡更多，我也不及一一記憶了。從見心齊出來，再騎驢到香山飯店，略進茶點。那裹尚備了旅居，房間每天僅二十元，比了北京城內便宜得多，然而設備太差了。西山一帶，以前原有很多的飯店，可是事變時會有燬於砲火者。我們最後才採了些紅葉騎驢下山，仍舊換車而回。在回來的途中，本想再到玉泉山靜明園去，可是時間已經過遲了。靜明園原和上述香山的靜宜園齊名，尤其那裹的泉水頂好，此間的汽水即由該泉所汲取製成，可惜天涼了汽水也買不到了，我們只得悵然回進城去。</p>

<h3>中日同盟週年全市熱烈慶祝</h3>
<p>各團體聯合舉行紀念儀式　　今（卅日）日爲中日同盟條約週年紀念，值茲大東亞決戰之秋，中日兩國駢肩分担向完遂最後勝利之途邁進，值此週年紀念，適盟邦日本神勇將士在太平洋台灣菲律賓東方海面迭奏赫赫戰果，重創頑敵，其意義至爲重大，是以今日全國朝野莫不敷　熱烈慶祝。本市方面由市府通令各機關轉飭各商店住戶，一律於晨起懸旗誌慶，並在各重要街　，懸掛締盟慶祝畏類跨街標語。上午十時本市市黨部新運分會，青少年團市團部，中央青年幹部學校上海分校，中青模範團第四聯隊東亞聯盟上海分會等各團體，特聯合在番禺路廿二號市黨部大禮堂擴大舉行紀念儀式，下午三時據聞市府並特舉行茶會，招待盟邦各機關，以誌慶賀。</p>

<h3>宇佐美公使談話</h3>
<p>當此中日同盟條約成立一週年紀念日，日本駐上海特命全權公便宇佐美珍彥氏發表談話，其主旨在於強力推進中日永久友好關係，並對阻害中日友好之英美，斷然加以擊滅，其談話如下：</p>
<h3>大捷聲中意義重大</h3>
<p>自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，已有二年另十月，恰巧我軍於太平洋上痛擊宿敵，一舉而獲歷史上未會有之大勝之際，而迎中日同盟條約成立一週年紀念日，其意義極爲深長也。中日二國之關係，不論自地理歷史民族及文化之四種見地觀之，均當觀善友好，而爲同盟之國，而近年以來，二國國交逐漸惡化，終至武力衝突，而發生民國二十六年之中日事變，至今尚未完全解決，深爲遺憾。推其原因，雖由於兩國責任當局之措置失宜，而若加以深刻檢討，其根本之原因，實由於英美兩國之東亞政策即爲反間苦肉以阻害中日之友好，而中日雙方未覺英美之奸計也。此實爲東亞之內亂之過程，而中日兩國人士，逐漸反省自覺，於是在中國即有和平運動之興起，而後國民政府乃還都南京，於是英美之離間中日感情之政策，更形露骨，以使中日兩大民族永久鬥爭。</p>
<h3>擊滅英美實現理想</h3>
<p>而至最近中日兩國均已覺悟，而日本開始擊滅英美之大東亞戰爭，以掃蕩阻害中日國交之大敵，中日兩大民族已携手同步，向擊滅英美之大道邁進，於是中國國民政府亦對英美宣戰而建立中日兩大民族之永久友好基礎，並基於互惠平等之原則，而得相互之丁解，於去年今日成立中日同盟條約，以闡明此項原則，相互遵守，中日友好關係之樹立，非但對於兩國政府均有實踐之義務，且兩國每一國民均有實踐之義務也。而爲積極達到此項目的起見，對於阻害中日友好之英美，乃展開武力的經濟的以及思想的綜合戰，而我等須於各自之立塲，盡最大之努力，斷然擊滅英美，以達戰中日同盟條約之共同理想，有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>市經濟局積極抑平物價</h3>
<p>昨召各公會理事長訓話　　本市經濟局徐局長爲積極抑平物價，發動經濟警察實施全市大檢查，並與各方面密切連絡，除於前日下午在華懋飯店招待全市中外新聞記者，闡明此次大檢查意義外，復於昨（二十九）日下午四時在市商會大禮堂召集全市各業同業公會理事長訓話，嚴飭各該公會，遵照政府規定辦法，協助政府抑平物價，務使此種不合理之物價漲風完全戢止，以安民生，並由實業部商業司陶司長代表陳部長訓話，希望各公會理事長仰體政府抑平物價之至意，領導同業與政府合作協力完成抑平物價之目的，語多惕勵。繼由各公會理事長提出意見。當經徐局長逐項予以釋明，至六時散會</p>
<h3>市主要物品將補行發售</h3>
<p>關於南市全區主要物品綜合配給證·業已散發完竣，物配處刻正縝密統計中，一俟就緒，所有食米，黃荳，麵粉，煤球等物品，即將於日內分別補行發售。</p>
<h3>一週工商市況</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市況·上週間因財部頒布強化上海特別市金融機關業務綱要，規定充實金融機關內容，增加資本，限制放款，及上海特別市經濟局強力抑平物價，會同經濟保安處舉行全市倉庫大檢查，澈懲囤積，取締非法抬高市價，已使投機市儈不敢蠢動，金融益趨穩定，物價漲風轉平。銀行錢莊停止主要商品押放，催收放款，銀根已趨寬鬆。黃金自週一起至週五，均在回低下降，惟週六上午市面突又轉漲，紋銀及銀元平穩不動，聯鈔因需要殷切，市價始終趨高勢。股票則以行莊停放收欠，各類股票均形萎疲之勢。工廠業情形未見波動，主要物品，工商雖調整電力消耗，但開工生產率仍未減低。米價及什糧以及食用品市價，上週一至週六，俱見平平，惟米糧週六復見高峯，其黃金與米糧在週六轉漲原因，蓋一般擁有資金及囤有日用品者，均轉移目標購買黃金，或取藏米糧，而持貨者乘機把持，引起市價反乎趨漲，惟此情勢係投機者末路，難能影響一般物價趨昂云。</p>

<h3>旅館公寓內不准抽頭聚賭</h3>

<p>中日同盟一周紀念特輯</p>
<h3>中日締盟與保衛東亞</h3>
<p>去年今日，中日兩國締結同盟條約，不僅在中日國交史上是劃時代的一頁，即在東亞建設上也是空前未有之嶄新的一頁，回憶中日兩國間因蘆溝橋事變而發生的破局，於三年後，因基本關係條約的成立，而得到了收拾，自此以來的三年後，到去年終於因爲在中日兩國上下一致的熱意下，而締結了同盟條約，約定互尊領土主權，永保友好，并且還進一步的爲建設大東亞而確立了同盟關係，這種中日關係進展，影響所及，則不僅是中日兩國的將來，而是整個大東亞的前途，乃至世界新秩序的建設　　在今日因世界國勢的推移，和平運動已不能僅僅只是爲中日間的和平，而應該是爲東亞乃至世界和平的一大運動。和平運動從發動　釀到國府還都以至中日基本條約成　和日本恢復正常關係，這是和平運動初步的成功，因爲全面和平還未實現，而大東亞戰爭爆發了，於是和平運動乃發展爲協力大東亞戰爭，以求實現整個東亞和平，到去年一月九巨又再進一步國府正式布告向英美宣戰，參加大東亞戰爭，而和平運動也就發展到了世界的性格，期在澈度擊滅英美支配世界的舊勢力後，　　個世界的和平，不過在這　有一點，在日本是始終不忘記面要爭取的，　　中國的獨亨自主，在這個根本的國是　遠大的世界眼光下，中日關係不必然的從基本條約進展　同盟條約，中國所要求的是完成獨　自主，這在中呂商　條約的簽訂，　　成了和平運動的成果，於此　得到了事實的證明。中日兩國的關係由這個時候　，已經不是單獨　於兩國，實足以決定東亞　至世界的命運，這個論調到了今日已經更加信　有　。　　　因爲在今日的大東亞戰局下，英美之企圖反攻，再　其　覆東亞之野心，以及渝方之甘爲英美利用，拖延抗戰，都足使中日兩國爲兩國本身之生存及整個東亞之生存而有更加緊密協力之必要。因爲中國之復興，東亞之保衛，除了打擊英美澈底粉碎其野心以外，已經別無自衛自存之道，是故從中日締盟到保衛東亞，這是具有始終一貫的　　的，吾人爲實踐盟　，爲復興中國，在這最後的決戰階級上，必須以吾人之全力，與盟邦日本全面協力，以保衛東亞，這也就是爲着求中國之獨立自由，亦惟有如此，才眞正是實踐了中日同盟條約。近三週來台灣東方與菲東海面之盟軍，連戰皆捷已使全東亞十億民族一致振奮，吾人今日紀念中日締盟週年，料惟有以親臨前綫之情緒，作奮不顧身之努力，以粉碎敵人之反攻企圖，而肩荷保衛東亞之使命。（中央社）</p>
<h3>大陸戰爭與渝美的末落</h3>
<p>中國大陸方面的戰事，日軍一面在攻擊敵美軍，一面進逼桂林附近。該地爲駐渝美空軍耗七萬萬元巨資而建成的華南最大基地，爲產生幾年來他們所　　的對日空襲夢之源泉。然而粉碎了無數敵基地羣，窮追駐渝美空軍於內地的日本軍，不日可奪取這大基地了。史蒂威爾，捷諾特的驚咜，更甚於依賴美國的蔣介石。這是美從軍記者親筆所書的；駐渝美空軍早已捨棄薛岳部下的渝軍，退却到安全的內地。而後面殘剩的破壞部隊，依史蒂威爾軍的命令，炸毀這豪華的飛行基地。美從軍記者的敗退記寫着，桂林一帶的死亡者，祇有中國人。上次梧州陷落時，駐渝美空軍不僅使重慶當局嚴命市民強制疏散，並且從空中縱火焚燬梧州市街。　　就梧州，桂林的例子看來，敵美軍到處以中國戰綫的主人公自居，爲了自己的作戰，常以渝軍及中國市民爲犧牲。中國人不是人。不過是完成美國野心的手段。因而他們對中國的都市實施焦土戰術。美國的這種態度，勢必詔　中國的有心人士的反感，而在重慶產生了下面的話。[美國從一援將]變成[導將]。　　這以美駐渝空軍爲主力的美軍事力，現在支配着中國戰綫，渝軍名爲友軍，實是美國的次殖民地軍。他們以中國戰綫爲太平洋戰綫的重要的一翼，企圖夾擊日本，並抱着熾烈的願望，從事增強其戰　力。實是這種企圖的美國軍事力，由於日本的中國作戰，着着佔先，對整個大東亞戰局，給與重大的影響。因此，他們不能不重視在中國的接連敗退。桂林退却時，他們會說：[我們在這裹，在這敗亡的瞬間，此一戰將日美戰事拖長六個月。]對太平洋攻勢的進展，希望打開絕　的窮途。　　此在美國導演下的蔣介石亦然。他在上次參政會閉幕的演詞中，承認今日駐渝美軍及渝軍的慘敗，他說：[中國戰綫爲世界戰綫的一部，那裹面有四十一個聯合國參加，與其他戰綫密切聯絡。我們遭敗績，但另一方面友軍戰勝，抵消了我們的敗亡。]俯仰由人，這是跟着美國的蔣介石之現狀。我們以東亞同族之誼，不禁寄與一次同情。但美蔣所期待者，實在於太平洋，中國戰綫的改退愈深刻，這傾向愈強烈。中國戰綫與太平洋戰綫的相關關係，因敵的迫近而愈明瞭且重大。敵人在中國的悲呼，與敵人在太平洋的攻勢的方向，表示日本的中國作戰所盡的任務，更大於本土的防衛。進一步說：大東亞戰爭是決戰的連續，在本質上同時又爲長期戰，所以中國大陸在現在大戰中所佔的地位，實有改變看法的必要。（譯自十月五日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>重慶的對蘇接近</h3>
<p>從南北二路欲包圍桂林的大陸作戰，一天天的進展着。上月二十七日，更在福州附近奇襲登睦，先事佈置，以封閉美國的作戰意圖。自本年春四月的湖南作戰以來，渝軍的不斷敗績，及最近桂林危機的迫切，在重慶政權的政治上，不能不起變化，重慶的對蘇接近，即爲其一。　　本來，在沒有自主的拖戰力的重慶，外交路綫爲其生死所繫的重大問題。中國事變初起時重慶的外交路綫，向着日本以外的一切國家。但自三國防共協定以後，與德義的聯繫斷絕了，大東亞戰爭以後，專接近英美，特別是美國，以至於今。今日重慶外交路綫的重心，實集中於美國。大東亞戰爭勃發前後，在重慶看來，蘇聯亦爲重心路綫，但因德蘇戰爭開始，重慶對美依存的加速，對蘇路綫似乎被遺忘了，以至於在去年底在新疆省境的對蘇衝突。　　然而最近重慶開始了很明顯對蘇接近工作。在增進對蘇親善的名目下，令新疆省主席盛世才辭職，以吳忠信繼任，更迭迪化的外部聯絡官，起用前莫斯科的重慶參事劉澤雲，擬更新對蘇外交。上月的參政會中，並提議表決強化中蘇合作案，派遣對蘇親善使節。據外電所傳，蘇聯遠東部長里凡諾夫·將抵重慶。又由於渝政權的改組，陳誠代排共派何應欽而進出，親蘇派巨頭孫科，中共領袖等的抬頭。這顯然可以斷定，重慶再轉變其外交路綫向蘇聯。　　那麼這訊急的對蘇接近，表示重慶的何種企圖呢？大陸作戰相繼失敗的結果，英美陣綫最近不信任重慶戰力的論調盛行，羅斯福以次作戰首腦部，不憚公然聲明，邱吉爾也公然在議會聲稱決戰時渝軍的不可靠。與此英美的誹謗重慶同時，重慶政權的對於美國的越權干涉，及戰後的野心等反感頗高，竟至於發生對美借款中止論，攻擊親美派等現象。重慶最近的對蘇接近，就是這對美問題的反動。　　其次，重慶目前所困惑者，是國共問題的不能解決，繼西安會談後的重慶會談，雖經華萊斯等半強制的和解但更趨惡化，卒有周恩來的拆台聲明，對此，重慶不免有所反駁，據外電所傳，毛澤東，朱德，周恩來，彭德懷等中共巨頭在延安聚會，密議對策。重慶的對蘇接近—因國共問題的不解決，而無經可尋，　　但現在的狀態，無論對蘇怎樣接近，在蘇聯以爲現在美國的援助重慶，顯然無補。且重慶政權也不會與美國絕緣。故美國的力量已深入重慶的心臓了。　　在國共問題上，現在處於攻勢地位的，還是延安政權。藉蘇聯的力量欲解決此對立，結果反增加延安的力量。要之，由於對蘇路綫的強化，茍欲閉鎖美國的野心，解決國共糾紛，其結果終歸失敗。然而終於不能不出此下策者，今日重慶政權的昏迷，可想而知了。（譯自十月五日讀書報知）</p>
<h3>重慶政權的危機惡性通貨膨脹造成經濟崩潰</h3>
<p>拖戰竟達七年之久的重慶政權，危機之一就是極端的惡性通貨膨脹所造成的經濟崩潰危機。下面一篇文章，是美國著名雜誌[新共和國]最近所發表的[無止境的中國通貨膨脹]一文，完全是一篇實際情形的報告，作者愛利克，塞維賴叙述抗戰區內中國民衆都面臨着餓死綫，而高聲喊破這就是拖日的代價。下面就是譯文：　　重慶辖境所進行的極端惡性通貨膨脹，是從一九二三年德國造成曠古未有的空前紀錄以來，世界上簡直是無獨有偶的。數星期前，記者在重慶某大飛機塲，會看見深綠色飛機—轟炸機和戰鬥機等—從印度方面飛來，而另外在飛機塲一角上看見飛機上寫着[中國航空公司]白字的漂亮輸送機降落。人山人海，脚夫從那些許多輸送機裹搬出笨重的箱子，然後小心翼翼地裝到戰重汽車上。這些箱子裹裝着的，是從美國運來的重慶紙幣，這就是對被熱所壓迫的重慶經濟體之注射劑。　　這批紙幣的大部份，都是紐約美國紙幣印刷公司所造成者，但全都是十塊頭以上者。這就是說，吃飯買物，差不多都用不着十塊頭鈔票了。這類紙幣，每月不止幾頓，遠遠從美國，經過太平洋和印度，而轉運至重慶的。　　重慶政權所絞腦榨汁的，就是應當怎樣配合月月提高一成的物價，而大量印刷鈔票。鈔票的流通額，業已達到驚人的數字，所以重慶政權並無發表實際數字的勇氣。有些地方的物價，比一九三七年是暴勝到二百五十倍。現在美金一元的法定價格爲二十元法幣，但准許外交官和外國新聞記者，按三十元法幣兌換一元美金。但黑市竟達八十元至九十元，所以重慶法幣一元的購買力，實際上僅等於美金的五分錢，一元重慶法幣所能買者，是半盒惡質的香烟，是半斤落花生，是六張打字機用紙，如用一元重慶法幣坐公共汽車，僅能坐三四里路。買一雙新皮鞋竟要五百元法幣，一件舊雨衣需要一千五六百元重慶法幣，這豈不是令人咋舌麼？記者在重慶飯館內和另外三個人吃普通飯，竟一餐花去四百元重慶法幣，眞是叫人啼笑皆非。因爲重慶不能從海外輸入消費品，但中國的商店內，却滿滿地陳列着奢侈品。（安譯自十月四日每新聞）</p>
<h3>告重慶民衆—松島部長廣播演詞—</h3>
<p>中國方面艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於本月二十八日午後八時半，假上海國際廣播電台及上海廣播電台對重慶人士充其對渝軍政部長何應欽氏作下列廣播，其詞如下：</p>
<h3>機動部隊大受損害</h3>
<p>今日又擬將菲島方面日美大海戰之結果，敬告親愛之重慶諸君：美軍甚爲焦急者，不外速以麥克沃塞部隊登陸菲律賓，以便與中國大陸取得連絡，但此次美方蒙受意外鉅大損失，亦係因此種粗暴行動所招來者，諒諸君必已明瞭矣。余會於本月廿二向諸君報告，美軍爲援助麥克活塞部隊之登陸，會命哈爾塞襲擊日本台灣及琉球，然此舉終遭日陸軍部隊之邀擊而失敗，但美軍仍不以此而退縮，企圖強行菲島之登陸，終於自十月十八日以來開始襲擊民大那瓦與呂宋中間之雷伊泰島，先此菲島方面之日航空部隊，會在菲島東方海面捕捉進行中之敵方機動部隊，而予以甚大之損害。然敵方陸上部隊竟敢開始攻擊菲島之一角落，日方觀此情形，認爲不可多得之良機，終於使自開戰以來久待機會之聯合艦隊出動，然而敵方未知此事，麥克活塞部隊屢次蒙受巨創之後，始得登陸雷伊泰島，建築脆弱之橋頭堡，一方大事宣傳，調其企圖已成功。</p>
<h3>日艦英勇使敵驚訝</h3>
<p>本月二十二日，偶而聽得重慶之廣播，並聽得余最信賴之何應欽先生讚美美軍之菲島登陸，且以爲中國大陸與美軍之連絡已完成而喜悅不已。余聽後殊覺意外，美軍夢想之慾望，已到被我方摧殘之期矣。我方聯合艦隊以強有力之戰艦航空母艦巡洋艦驅逐艦潛水艇之大編隊，敢行非神仙不易做到之進擊，出現於菲島，猛烈開始襲擊美國海陸部隊，對於日本艦隊之英勇行動，美國聯合艦隊司公長官金提督會發表下列談話：[日本艦隊能通過翻身尚不易之榨小海峽，實值吾人敬訝，使其能有此行動之背後，必有不可思議之原因。]何應欽先生，閣下會留學日本者，金提督之言，請深深加以考察，美國提督之不能判斷知曉之事，乃是日本海軍偉大之處，此種事實絕不能以數字計算者，自不可與飛機軍艦等具有物體者同日而論。</p>
<h3>艦砲威力世界第一</h3>
<p>二十四晨，日本艦隊終於出現於菲島東方海面，日本艦隊自從華盛頓會議以來二十餘載，專心於造艦技術之研究，以致有今日精堅之戰艦，且得有使金提督驚訝之訓練之精華，而大顯身手之日巳來到矣。猛烈空載之後，繼續由二萬公尺近距離發射之我方戰艦之威力，尤堪稱爲世界第一，敵艦不堪我方之砲擊，逃之無路，屢發請求救助之電信，威力之大，可窺一斑。日本艦隊更突入敵方輸送船團及護衛艦艇羣集之雷伊泰灣，表演一如水滸傳中之全武行，以寒敵人心，雷伊泰灣內遽而成爲火海，火燄聳天之敵方輸送艦以及艦艇，擊破航空母艦七隻，戰艦一隻，巡洋艦二隻，擊沉航空母艦八隻，巡洋艦三隻，驅逐艦二隻。此外在雷伊泰灣內擊破或擊沉巡洋艦驅逐艦十三隻，油槽艦一隻，艦種不明者五隻，輸送艦十八隻，又擊落飛機五百架於菲島海面，擊破七十二架於雷伊泰灣內。</p>
<h3>台菲海面綜合戰果</h3>
<p>茲將台灣海面開戰以來之戰果綜合如下；擊沉或擊破者航空母艦三十四隻，戰艦七隻，巡洋艦十四隻，驅逐艦四隻，巡洋艦或驅逐艦未詳者四隻，輸送艦四十七隻以上，艦種不明者十六隻，大型舟艇十六隻，油糟船一隻，合計一百五十四隻以上。太平洋之美軍巳失去殆半，尤其敵方最珍貴之戰艦及航空母艦之多數，已被葬於海底，此事實殊堪惹起世界之注目與驚嘆。至於人員之損失大約五十萬人，美國至今仍以未調查完竣爲敵，未敢發表戰果，一味企圖朦蔽世人，但事實爲事實，美國已蒙鉅大之打擊，不單無以攻略菲島，其太平洋作戰計劃已遭重大障礙，本月二十七日美國海軍節時，羅斯福大總統未會具體言及此項之海戰之情形，勉強守沉默，此一左證也。帝國海軍立刻整頓陣容，更進行剿滅雷伊泰島登陸敵部隊，此次海戰之最後結果，終將決定此後日美戰爭之趨向。又會妄動於尼可巴　之英國艦隊，自遭日航空部隊襲擊蒙受鉅創之後，倉惶遁去，淒慘不堪。</p>
<h3>特別攻擊隊之神勇</h3>
<p>余又擬炎及本日十五時大本營發表之[神風特別攻擊隊]，余對於此兵器之機構不便發表，但此種新兵器僅日本人或中國人，即體會東亞精神之人始能操縱，何應欽先生諒亦能了解之。關大尉以下四名之我方海軍航空勇士操此新兵器，以肉體向飛機猛烈衝去，而擊毀美國航空母艦二隻，巡洋艦一隻，不外爲熱烈之日本魂，而令美人心寒膽戰之神技，又堪聳動世界人士之耳目，其忠勇精神自能流芳萬世，渝方諸君：偉大之東亞精神或東亞人原有之力量，祇依努力，即可發揮至此程度，依賴英美成其奴隸，體面全被蹂躪，此種作法，豈是救中國之途徑，余願諸君早日恢復東亞人之本色，連就正軌，不勝企盼桂林敗走記</p>
<p>— 美國戰地記者筆述</p>
<p>日本大軍向桂林進攻，這就是表示敵方對日反攻的前綫最大據點，即將陷於崩潰。最近美國[時代]週刋上發表了一篇美國戰地記者戴狄·懷特的[桂林敗走記]，會起了很大的反響。下面就是節課下來的文章，描寫着因日軍的進攻，而陷於混亂中的桂林美渝軍，破壞了軍事設施，而敗走的如實寫照　　奎貝克英美軍最高首腦部正在團繞着桌傍舉行結束戰爭會議的時候，大東亞戰爭却在順利地進行，日本軍隊在開始驅逐華南最大前進基地[桂林]的申諾特（美國駐華第四航空部隊司令官）所領導的空軍部隊。在這個地方透露出美國敗北的徵兆。　　很多人都經騐過一九四二年協約國的軍事失利，但很少人知道上週所發生的同樣軍事失利。　　受到此一重大打擊前，美渝軍會在衡陽南方進行過兩星期的大戰。天天不斷的雲霧，因此美方的空軍優勢，不能充分發揮威力，結果只好告別桂林，而太陽就照耀於空中了，但[時間已遲了]，美軍部隊在中國兵士引導之下撤退了。</p>
<h3>兵器的雜亂</h3>
<p>防衛廣西全省和桂林的兵器，可以說應有盡有。其中有美國造大砲，蘇聯造坦克，日本造和中國造的火砲。其中還有盡量使用過的砲，也有完全不能使用的砲。重慶方面司令官薛岳，率領部下四千，但掌有能使用的步槍，僅其半數兩千·該部隊甚至並無掩護所需要的木材，也無與美國飛機連絡的信號旗，同時也沒有部隊本部與支隊連絡的無綫電。　　日本軍則不這樣，不僅有威力而且有機動性，無論什麼地方，都能勝任愉快地派遣優勢的兵力。　　我們本想在全縣北方，即桂林東北約一百四五十公里的黃沙河附近，阻止日軍前進。然而這條路，却在我們計劃前四天，被日軍通過了。桂林的許多空軍基地，於是不得不在二十六小時內撤退，破壞和放棄。兵員和望遠鏡也都準備撤退。爲毫無停頓地進行對日作戰，仍然在桂林執行最後的任務，然後乘暗夜而向南方逃走。爲找到後方基地的連絡綫，而第二天一早，克靈吞·魏塞特少將及丁巴曼和狄維德兩平作戰參謀，乘上最後的一架飛機，而出發了。後面只剩下了華爾德·克諾遜上校領導的破壞部隊，最後便決定炸毀飛機塲和建築物。</p>

<p>一到郊外，看見最後一批的難民，或坐黃包軍，或坐馬車，或步行，都源源不絕地擁擠在道路上，現出可憐的形相，而在逃路。禁止通行的市內，士兵們在拼命準備即將使用的機關槍，挖掘戰壕，防壁等。斯蒂維爾批准最後撤退的那天早晨，携同申諾特以及美軍將校訪間重慶指揮官張發奎，共商軍事大局，而美軍將校領到地圖和空中照片等。斯蒂維爾命令點火並開始撤退了。經過數小時後，他們離開了。我們山谷中所有的兵營都點起了火，每一個破壞部隊兵士，都手裹拿着一桶汽油。建築物一個一個地炸毀了，最後全谷都烈火燃燒了。有時候，整個房頂被炸到地下，而碎成片片細瓦。火像一條激流一樣，吞沒了建築物。黃·紅·白等色的火燄，焚毀着房屋。破壞炸彈，正像中國過年時的爆竹一樣，在我們的周圍不斷地響着。有時候感覺到像身體被巨石打中了一樣　　單就我們的一個飛機塲說，需要破壞的建築物，竟達五百五十所之多。在這一飛機塲上我們所投下的費用，竟達中國法幣七萬萬元之多，即美金七千萬元。我們炸毀戰　機用滑走路時，業已稍徵天亮了。我們跑到飯堂去，吃最後的鹹肉和鷄蛋。文蓋特少將對我說：[關於此次戰爭，我想寫一本書]。他說那本書的標題是[火熖，陷落與敗走]。</p>
<h3>日軍目的在消滅美軍</h3>
<p>我們不知道重慶軍隊是否將要死守桂林。他們在英勇作戰着。而數千人沿着河，在市街的防壘上死去的，全是中國人，但這個戰爭是我們共同的戰爭，亦即是我們共同的失敗。日本軍隊對於此次戰爭，是有很多目的的。例如爲了不在海面上受到美國飛機和潛水艇的威脅，以求陸地上唯一的南方通路，擊潰重慶的最新軍隊，在政治上想動搖重慶政府等。然而這些目的全是次要的，日軍的主要目的，始終是在於消減美軍和佔領美國航空基地。我們對於這次桂林敗戰，知道是使日美戰爭延長六個月的。日空軍昨天深夜來轟炸我們這一基地，所以我們都在細長的防空壕內睡了一夜。有一個人告訴我說，美國海軍今天在帛琉島登陸了。我會跑到一位上尉處去問，登陸是否事實。上尉回答說：[唔？帛琉島？這些傢伙們也不能不急於登陸麼？]（安譯自十月四日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>One Year Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Solidifies the Belief in Inevitable Victory; Acting Chairman Chen and Ambassador Tani Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Today (30th) marks the one-year anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. At a time when successive victories are being achieved in the Pacific theater, and the Greater East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, it is imperative that we strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation to fulfill the alliance, and even more so to exert our full strength to complete the war. On this anniversary of the alliance, Acting Chairman Chen of our National Government has issued a special statement, clarifying the significance of the commemoration and instructing the people of the nation. The full text of the statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen's Statement</p>
<p>The 30th of this month marks the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the 6th of next month marks the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The former completely swept away the traces of unequal treaty constraints that China had suffered for a century, fully restoring the original appearance of East Asian compatriots. The latter established the fundamental principles of independence, autonomy, mutual coexistence, and co-prosperity for East Asian nations, enabling all East Asian countries and ethnic groups to unite as one, cooperate with one heart, and break the oppression and exploitation of Anglo-American colonialism, so that each East Asian</p>
<p>Nation</p>
<p>may rely on its own inherent characteristics to ensure its survival and development, and rely on its interconnected relationships of mutual respect and mutual assistance to strive for coexistence and co-prosperity. The spirit and purpose of both are consistent from beginning to end. Over the past year, the development of the situation has made the meaning of this treaty and this declaration all the more real and valuable. Speaking of the former, not only has the troop withdrawal issue, which the people of the country have been anxiously awaiting, been concretely resolved, but also the right to station troops based on the Boxer Protocol has been resolutely abandoned due to the sincerity of our allies. Not only can the doubts of the people of the country regarding past diplomatic documents be dispelled like clouds and mist due to the invalidation of the Sino-Japanese</p>
<p>Basic Relations</p>
<p>Treaty and all its associated documents, but also the concerns about China's freedom and unity in political and economic terms can be completely eliminated due to the conclusion of the alliance treaty. Not only can the expectations of the people of the country that peace can only be realized by returning to the state before the Lugouqiao Incident be fulfilled, but also, with the recovery of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the abandonment of the right to station troops, it has actually exceeded several times over, and the cornerstone of righteous peace between China and Japan can be laid here. Furthermore, the Anglo-American aggressors, using East Asians to kill East Asians, and using China as a battlefield, with their ambition of scorched earth not yet extinguished, have led to a</p>
<p>State of War</p>
<p>continuing to drag on, and peaceful unification cannot be realized. War cannot be entrusted to illusory miracles, and peace cannot be attained by relying on a slim chance of fate. Time slips away, how can we not feel deeply moved? Speaking of the latter, since the oppression and exploitation of colonialism are intolerable to the East Asian nations, then the efforts of the East Asian nations to seek independence, autonomy, coexistence, and mutual defense will inevitably be hated and resented by Anglo-American colonialists. Understanding this, the closer the time for the final decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War approaches, the more bitter and more brutal the final struggle of Anglo-American colonialists will be, and the more arduous and brighter the task of our East Asian nations to devote their full strength to this battle for the survival of their countries and for the security of East Asia. For both, everything depends on the people of the nation to</p>
<p>Actively Rise Up</p>
<p>and encourage each other to bring into play the true spirit of the Joint Declaration with the determination to sacrifice, and to translate every word of the alliance treaty into reality with realistic efforts. As we commemorate the first anniversary of the alliance treaty and the Joint Declaration, which coincides with the unfolding of the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to expressing our gratitude to our ally Japan for assisting our country in achieving independence and self-reliance, and leading the countries of East Asia in jointly seeking liberation, we have no choice but to redouble our efforts, leading the people internally to eliminate obstacles in order to promote the peaceful unification of the country; externally, we must exert our national strength to follow our allies in completing the sacred war of East Asia, saving China and protecting East Asia. There is no other path.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani's Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, issued the following statement to commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty: Today marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. This treaty has epoch-making significance, and it is truly a great anniversary for officials and civilians of both China and Japan to celebrate together. Although this treaty has only a very few articles, its stipulated content has extremely important historical significance not only for China and Japan, but also for all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. For</p>
<p>China and Japan</p>
<p>have clearly indicated in this treaty that they will practice good neighborliness, respect each other's autonomy and independence, and cooperate closely to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, and contribute to world peace. And they have the firm determination to eliminate all obstacles and sources of disaster. From this, the two countries, each in its original state, have established a foundation of lasting friendship. And for the construction of Greater East Asia and the assurance of its stability, they will cooperate closely to exert all their strength. Looking back over the past year, China and Japan, in accordance with the provisions of this treaty, have been</p>
<p>actively cooperating</p>
<p>in various aspects such as military affairs, politics, economy, and culture, on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit, and equality, to strike down the Anglo-American enemies who are invading East Asia, sharing weal and woe, and striving day and night. Therefore, the close ties between the two countries based on morality are now absolutely unshakable. However, according to the current situation in East Asia, the United Kingdom and the United States are seeking to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia. They are dividing and echoing each other in East Asia, especially in areas under the rule of Chongqing. They have set up air bases, dispatched troops to garrison, and strengthened the use of Chinese territory as a battlefield, and are gradually turning China into a colony at the expense of the Chinese people. Therefore, the current war situation is increasingly entering a</p>
<p>Critical Stage</p>
<p>At a time when great war results have been achieved in Taiwan and the Philippines in striking down the enemy's American fleet, it is becoming increasingly evident that China and Japan can accomplish their common mission, which is deeply gratifying. Commemorating the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty today has even more profound significance. As we commemorate the anniversary of the alliance treaty, I sincerely wish for a bright future for China and Japan, and hope that as the war situation progresses, the two countries will further strengthen their cooperation and renew their firm determination to strive to achieve the lofty goals of this treaty.</p>
<h3>Ba Maw Phones Philippine President to Encourage Combat</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Myanmar's Head of State, Ba Maw, issued a statement on the 25th to the President of the Republic of the Philippines, Laurel, encouraging the Philippines in the decisive battle. The original text is as follows: To His Excellency President Laurel, The enemy forces are currently attacking fiercely in order to gain a foothold in the Philippines. During this intense battle period, I represent the entire people of Myanmar to offer sympathetic assistance to Your Excellency. We, the people of Myanmar, fully understand the burden of the Philippines, and are fiercely attacking the enemy's vast material resources. Myanmar will also resist the enemy's barbaric attacks for a long time, but the will of us East Asians has not been broken. We believe that our Philippine comrades will be able to coexist and perish with all of East Asia in this war. The Philippines and Myanmar will resolutely defend their fortresses.</p>
<h3>Asahi Shimbun Special Correspondent Mr. Ina's Recent Visit to the Western Front, Impressions Gained Indicate Enemy Forces Should Be Warded Against, Especially the Airborne Units Invading the Netherlands Area</h3>
<p>The Western Front situation is as follows:</p>
<p>It may not be possible to say that the western fortresses are strong fortresses that can resist the overwhelming material strength of the enemy, but the final line with the German mainland as the stage, in addition to the tank trenches and fortress facilities, the German people's defense line must also be considered by the British and Americans. As a result, the focus of the attack is extremely cautious, avoiding the western fortress line and choosing to enter from the Belgium and Netherlands area. This is a common tactic for the British and Americans. If it is said that Aachen cannot be broken through, the war is still limited to the outer perimeter of Germany, then a real invasion of the German mainland will not occur.</p>
<p>The British and Americans will publicize that due to the continued pursuit of the German army after the occupation of France, and due to the chaos of the defeated German army, the period of Germany's surrender, that is, the end of the European war, will be unexpectedly fast. The annihilation battle of the enemy's airborne units in Ating gave a great blow in this battle, showing Germany's fighting spirit, contrary to the enemy's expectations, and extremely focused on national defense posture, not only geographical, that is, the defense of the fortress line, but also mobile defense. The defeat of the German army in the Battle of Farange and Falaise in the Faya territory was actually a battle to avenge their humiliation, and it was a sign that Germany had begun a decisive battle, which boosted the morale of the entire army.</p>
<p>Germany and France Cooperate Again</p>
<p>Germany sees this as a sign that it will improve soon. Although it cannot be rashly said that this is optimistic material for the future, Germany has indeed gained enough time to prevent the enemy from intruding into the real final line. As far as the enemy, the British and Americans, are concerned, before the terrible attack that Germany is trying to launch begins, Germany has more time to defend, which is even more painful than cutting the skin. If the war relying on material strength cannot realize the dream of taking Berlin without any stagnation, the advantage of material strength may not be able to achieve decisive war results. In response to the victory in the northern theater, a political counterattack to regain France has also begun in the south. Politicians of the pro-German collaborationist faction who withdrew from Paris and Vichy are planning to regain their motherland, and the time to put it into action has arrived. For a time, both sides seemed to have forgotten this issue due to the tension on the western front. Since the fall of Paris, France has disappeared from the world's vision, and now it has suddenly begun to attack the Tegoul faction and the communist system front. [German-French cooperation] was once again loudly rumored. Now that I think about it, Marshal Petain and Prime Minister Laval should respond to Germany's request to move to eastern France. In Germany, this is a great victory. In law, he is the formal French chairman. In practice, there is no second person who can win over 40 million French people other than Marshal Petain.</p>
<p>The British and American occupied areas that have lost Marshal Petain cannot even operate Parisian politics smoothly. The lives of ordinary citizens are still confined to the dark of unease. The tendency for the infighting between the Tegoel faction and the communist elements to gradually intensify with the entire France as the stage is very clear even in fragmentary information. The Sorre occupied by the Communist Party declared itself the first Soviet region after the Anglo-American occupation. Tegul was very embarrassed. The military and political commander of Paris, Koenig, refused to demand the disarming of the Tegul elements and went to London to discuss it. This fact illustrates the chaotic situation in France.</p>
<p>Hitler's Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of Marshal Petain and the Laval government, the enemy will publicize that these people have become German prisoners or are imprisoned, but in terms of region, because the entire territory of France has been ravaged by the British and Americans, there is no factual administrative area, and there is no object for administering government affairs. The French government naturally has to stand by and wait for the situation to clarify. However, with the development of the situation, the French government has formed a German-French Cooperation Committee. The French government's minister in charge of German affairs, Ambassador Brignon, was changed to full power over Germany. Under him is Darnan, the Director-General of Public Security, as the Commissioner of French Volunteers, General Britt as the Commissioner of Prisoner Relations, and Minister of Labor Welfare, Diar, as the Commissioner of French Labor Issues. In addition, Lucier, who cooperated with us in the eastern French press, took the important position of Minister of Propaganda, each taking charge of the implementation of German military affairs.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American army on the declaration's French front and the Tegoel faction or the communist parties used newspapers and radios to launch a fierce offensive. The advanced base has crossed the Rhine River and advanced to the front line. The recent meeting between the three commissioners Brignon, Darnan, and Dia and the Head of State of Greece was the starting point for this political counterattack. It is faintly heard that Hitler first provided the French side with a concrete and detailed war plan during this meeting. He also gained a complete understanding of the previous military situation and insisted on breaking the Anglo-American forces to recapture the capital Paris as the goal and set off grandly.</p>
<p>Although the mountains and rivers of France have been broken, Germany still has 1 million French laborers and 1 million French prisoners. It is not difficult to gather the power of these 2 million people in the future to instigate the recapture of the motherland. Chairman Petain, who has been confined to his room for a while, has also been in high spirits recently, going out for a walk every morning, leisurely and optimistic about the future of the motherland. This shows that France has a bright future. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, October 2) Editorial</p>
<h3>One Year Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>Today marks the one-year anniversary of the signing of the alliance treaty between China and Japan in Nanjing last year. We have opened the full text of the alliance treaty and read it through. At the same time, we reviewed the relationship between China and Japan over the past year, as well as the general situation in Greater East Asia, and we have deep feelings. We will state what we have seen as follows.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the alliance treaty is based on the common objective requirements between the two countries. Since the signing of the basic treaty in November of the 29th year, the relationship between the two countries has entered a new stage. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the participation of the National Government in the war, and the implementation of the new China policy by Japan, the objective requirements between the two countries are completely consistent. Therefore, we will further sign the alliance treaty. However, we believe that how to cooperate in the spirit of the alliance to complete the common requirements is the policy of actively realizing the alliance treaty.</p>
<p>What are the common requirements? Of course, it is to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese side has already mobilized the full strength of 100 million people to destroy the British and Americans, especially the great victory in the sea battle in Taiwan and the Philippines, which laid the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In a narrow sense, this is the Japanese side has already fulfilled part of the responsibility of the allied country to us. As far as the Chinese National Government is concerned, some parts of the alliance treaty need to be fully adjusted when the overall peace is restored and the state of war ends. Therefore, the realization of comprehensive peace is, on the one hand, to enhance the guarantee of striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and on the other hand, it is a condition for fully restoring the normal relationship between China and Japan. However, according to the current situation, instead of talking about realizing comprehensive peace, it is better to start with the innovation of politics in the peace zone, so that the politics are on the right track, the public security is established, and the people's livelihood is stable. It is necessary to express this fact and strive for the people under the rule of Chongqing to return to their hearts. At this time, comprehensive peace will be realized without seeking it. However, over the past year, how is the effort in this area worth the authorities' reflection? Even if we take a step back, according to the exchange of notes in the alliance treaty, during the continuation of the state of war, adjustments can be made at any time by agreement between the two countries as permitted by the situation. Therefore, although there is the fact that Chongqing is delaying the war, we can still seek progress in political and economic aspects and make partial adjustments according to the spirit of the treaty. What about the efforts in this area in the past year? It is also worth the reflection of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must especially understand that the alliance treaty was revised and signed from the basic treaty. At that time, the determination to revise, as well as the exchange of notes of the alliance treaty and the protocol, were all proposed by the Japanese government on its own initiative. Why is the Japanese government willing to propose a revised treaty of mutual respect and mutual benefit? Of course, it is to express sincerity in friendship and cooperation with China, and it is a concrete manifestation after the implementation of the new China policy. However, although there have been various facts in the efforts over the past year, in order to promote greater cooperation between the two countries, this should be the most urgent situation at present. In order to strive for the victory of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we also hope that our allies can further promote the new China policy step by step and concretely realize it step by step.</p>
<p>Finally, we urge those who are obsessed with the British and Americans to be awakened from this. In this continental war, the battles in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, the fall of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, the crisis in Guilin, and the repeated defeats in the sea battles in Taiwan and the Philippines have fully exposed the unreliability of the British and Americans. The belief in Greater East Asianism should be strengthened. Strive for work in this position, cooperate with the government, supervise the government, complete the common requirements, and realize the alliance treaty.</p>
<h3>Thailand Strives to Complete Iron Wall Defense Posture</h3>
<p>Cooperate in the Greater East Asia Liberation War</p>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the outbreak of the war, Thailand has been engaging in the Greater East Asia Liberation War under the banner of destroying the British and Americans, based on the Thai-Japanese alliance. Since the establishment of the Abhaiwongse Cabinet, it has expressed its determination to complete the war and defend the country through Thai-Japanese cooperation. Since the formation of the cabinet, it has been preparing the domestic situation, actively building the national army, gathering the total strength of the country, and striving to establish a strong national defense posture. The various measures appropriate for the decisive battle cabinet have been implemented. First, the head lineup of the National Defense Army was adjusted. Then, at the beginning of September, the Thai government formulated the National Defense Council Law, established the National Defense Council, and the chairman was composed of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of Staff of the National Defense Army, the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, and five government-recommended committee members, with the Prime Minister serving as the Chairman of the National Defense Council. Article 5 of the law stipulates that the National Defense Council has the task of deliberating on military, economic, political, national security, and national defense issues both domestically and internationally, and has the authority to carry out undertakings related to the prosecution and completion of the war. This has the same character as the Japanese Supreme War Guidance Conference. After the rainy season, in order to prevent enemy air raids and implement various air defense countermeasures, the National Homeland Air Defense Command was newly established, with Deputy Minister of National Defense Shatnyudarak concurrently serving as the commander, and the Air Defense Bureau, which was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of National Defense during the Pibul Cabinet era, was still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense, so that information and orders could be quickly transmitted. On the other hand, in Bangkok and other major cities and towns, all but women and children were engaged in daily affairs, and factories and companies organized defense groups to ensure complete rescue and fire prevention during air raids. At the same time, the Japanese garrison in Thailand is also actively assisting Thailand's defense, especially air defense. Whenever enemy planes attack, Japanese and Thai soldiers and civilians must cooperate closely to destroy enemy planes and have now completed an iron wall defense posture.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Thai Cultural Association Commemorates Prime Minister Koiso's Congratulatory Telegram</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso sent a telegram to Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse on the 28th, the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Japanese-Thai Cultural Agreement, as follows: The conclusion of the Japanese-Thai Cultural Agreement, which is intended to promote and enhance the friendly relations between the two countries by virtue of the spiritual, cultural, and even religious similarities that have existed between the two countries since ancient times, is something that we deeply celebrate. Today, at a time when the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, we believe even more that the spiritual cooperation of the people of the two countries will, because of the conclusion of this agreement, become the driving force for breaking through the difficulties ahead. Here, in addition to expressing my gratitude to Your Excellency in the capacity of President of the Cultural Academy for your past efforts, I also earnestly hope that Your Excellency can make further efforts in the future.</p>
<h3>One Week War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Japanese Air Force Re-Attacks Chengdu Airport</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The war situation for the week is as follows: 1. On the western part of the Japanese mainland, about 100 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked various parts of Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th in order to cut off Japanese supplies to the Philippines, but 24 of them were shot down and destroyed by the Japanese Air Defense Force. In addition, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China pursued to Chengdu on the 26th and destroyed a total of 57 aircraft, causing most of the attacking enemy aircraft to collapse. 2. In China, the Japanese army's operations against the Guilin-Liuzhou area are still progressing smoothly. 3. In Myanmar, since the beginning of this month, enemy aircraft have been actively active in the entire city of Myanmar. Since the 18th, the results of the Japanese army's counterattack in the Yangon area have been 17 enemy aircraft shot down (including 6 unconfirmed) and 14 enemy aircraft destroyed. In addition, the British army's actions to respond to the Philippines operation from the Indian Ocean are also gradually becoming more active. 4. In Palau, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island still secures the central highlands and fights bravely, and those on Angaur Island also accurately secure the northwestern corner area and engage in fierce battles. The Japanese army on Morotai continues to engage in hand-to-hand combat, achieving great war results and preventing the enemy army from building and using airfields. 5. In the Philippines, about one division of the enemy on Leyte Island and about two divisions of the enemy on Dulag engaged in counterattacks and ambushes, and fierce land operations are still unfolding. The Japanese Air Force is still fully exerting its spirit of suicidal attacks, attacking enemy fleets in the bay day and night, and achieving great war results.</p>
<p>China Mainland Frontline Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to punish the US Air Force bombing squad stationed in Chongqing for the air raid on Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th, the Japanese bomber squadron braved bad weather on the night of the 26th and strongly attacked Chengdu Airport for the fourth time, achieving great war results. A total of 60 enemy aircraft were bombed and destroyed. On that night, a large formation of elite enemy bombers launched a retaliatory attack on Chengdu Airport, the resting place for B-29 aircraft, causing B-29 aircraft dispersed at Chengdu Airport to be successively burned down, and about ten ground facilities were bombed and burned, illuminating the area as if it were daytime. All of the B-29 aircraft groups south of the large runway were hit, and another attacking team also dropped countless bombs on the southwest of the airfield, with the wings of the enemy B-29 aircraft in the moon. Two locations were hit and caught fire, and the B-29 aircraft parked in the northwest were subjected to fierce bombing and burning.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Plans to Organize a General Rally</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since our ally Japan won an unprecedented victory in the East China Sea off Taiwan and the Philippines, all circles in the Suzhou Provincial Capital have felt deeply happy, and in order to realize the final victory as soon as possible, they have organized a preparatory committee for a general rally to celebrate the victory. After three meetings and discussions, the donation part was extremely enthusiastic.

<h3>Fierce Battle for the Scheldt Estuary: German Forces Retreat from Tilburg</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, according to the German official war bulletin: The fierce fighting in the Netherlands has expanded to the Scheldt estuary and the entire area between it and 's-Hertogenbosch. The battle of Bergen is particularly intense. Repeated offensives launched by enemy forces there with direct tank support have been repelled. Tilburg, to the east, has fallen into enemy hands after fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Although the German position at the Scheldt bridgehead and southern Beveland is increasingly difficult, the anti-Axis forces are still blocked outside the port of Antwerp. This is the greatest success of the German command. The garrison of the port will continue to resist despite the difficult situation. This difficult situation is due to the anti-Axis forces strengthening their position at the southeastern Beveland bridgehead, and the advance of Canadian forces in the western part of the isthmus. However, German forces are still strong, and the anti-Axis forces must pay a heavy price for any further advance. The Canadian First Army is attacking northwest Brabant and has advanced close to Roosendaal, but the enemy forces attacking Breda have made no progress. General Montgomery's focus of operations is currently on the left flank of the British Second Army, which is advancing northwest and west along the Tilburg-'s-Hertogenbosch line, in an attempt to drive the German forces to the coast. British forces have reached Tilburg after their success. German reinforcements are resisting the advance of British tank columns north and northwest of the city. The situation in that area is not yet stable. German forces have launched a strong counter-offensive west of the Meuse bridgehead at Venlo towards Helmond and Mierlo, on the right flank of the British Second Army. The British forces were caught unprepared and had to abandon some territory. The situation in the Aachen area remains unchanged. Anti-Axis forces have begun local reconnaissance activities in the center of Auvelais and Froidmont, indicating that the deployment of the US Third Army is complete and a general offensive is imminent. The US Seventh Army continued to exert pressure on Sainte-Dié and Gérardmer in the western Vosges on Friday, but without significant success.</p>
<h3>Change of Commander of US Forces in India-Burma-China Theater</h3>

Henceforth, US forces in India and Burma will be commanded by Lieutenant General Sultan, and US forces in China by Major General Wedemeyer.</p>
<h3>Renewed Conflict Between Chongqing and Communist Forces in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing government issued a major statement on the 26th, stating that the opposing Chongqing and Communist forces had opened fire in a corner of Shanxi Province, and the reconciliation between the two governments had reached a state of despair. Zhang Pingqun, spokesman for the Chongqing government, met with a group of reporters on the same day to further explain the details of the battle between the Chongqing and Communist forces as follows: Yan Xishan, commander of the Second War Zone, recently met with Chinese and foreign journalists in the northwest region to express his opinions on the Communist Party issue. Afterwards, he was abused and slandered by the Yan'an organ newspaper [Liberation Daily] and Communist military officers such as Chuan Yibo, commander of the Taiyue Military Region. Chuan Yibo, commander of the Taiyue Military Region, openly attacked the Chongqing 61st Army at Tashan, about 30 kilometers east of Linfen, in late August, and was repelled. In early September, the 210th, 212th, 213th, 385th, and 386th brigades of the Communist army formed four large detachments and attacked the 61st Army again at 10:00 AM on September 8. In addition, Communist mobile units attacked from Pingyao and Linfen along the Tongpu Railway. As a result, the Chongqing 72nd Division north of Fushan was forced to retreat to the southwest due to the superiority of the Communist forces.</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships and Vessels in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands; Remnants in Tacloban Being Swept Up</h3>
<p>Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – The intensity of the Japanese-American battle for Leyte is increasing daily. The enemy forces, attempting to regain air supremacy, have dispatched dozens of transport ships to Leyte Gulf, striving to strengthen their rear supply lines. At the same time, they are also urgently trying to use the occupied Tacloban and Dulag airfields to deploy carrier-based and land-based aircraft. Among these, 70 aircraft have already suffered a devastating blow. The enemy's rear is also actively engaged in airlift operations. On the other hand, they are concentrating tanks to attempt to seize the San Pablo airfield. Fierce battles are currently unfolding for the control of the La Paz and San Roque airfields in the south. Japanese forces on the island are securing the high ground in the west and continuing to attack the enemy's rear positions south of Tacloban with small forces. The current focus of the battle is south of that city, as the enemy forces attempt to seize control of the area near the Dulag and La Paz airfields.</p>
<p>Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese air units continued to be active in the Leyte area on the 27th, continuing to fiercely attack enemy warships, landing craft, and airfields under enemy occupation in the gulf. The war results that have been confirmed from the night of the 26th to noon on the 27th are as follows: one enemy transport ship and five destroyers destroyed, one enemy transport ship damaged by bombing, and two enemy aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces have suffered heavy damage from the continuous fierce attacks by Japanese air units, so the number of enemy aircraft attacks has decreased significantly in recent days. On the 27th, only 200 carrier-based aircraft and less than 100 land-based aircraft attacked various parts of the Philippines. The situation was even more relaxed on the morning of the 28th. In the Palawan area, enemy aircraft attacked only twice, the first time with only 14 large aircraft, and the second time with only 23 aircraft. In the Visayas area, enemy aircraft only carried out scattered attacks, with the sole purpose of patrolling and reconnaissance.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front Lines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze attack squadron, composed of fighter squadrons, is the essence of the Japanese Navy, and consistently adopts a heroic tactic, fighting to the death as soon as it encounters an enemy mobile force. These suicide squads began a general offensive on the 25th, flying their planes with a calm attitude and the determination to never return. According to their comrades, the details of the squadron's heroic battles are as follows: The first special attack squadron discovered an enemy mobile force in the eastern sea of Leyte Gulf. It immediately used two aircraft to sink a medium-sized aircraft carrier, and one aircraft to damage an aircraft carrier, rendering it unable to navigate, and also sunk a cruiser. Their spirit of disregard for life and fearlessness is truly worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Praises Kamikaze Squadrons for Heroic Battles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 3:00 PM on October 28: The commander-in-chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet recently issued the following announcement to the entire army to commend the members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron, the Shikishima Squadron: Lieutenant Junior Grade Seki Yukio, flight squadron leader; Petty Officer 1st Class Nakano Ban'o, attached to a flight squadron; Petty Officer 1st Class Tani Yasuo, attached to a flight squadron; Leading Seaman Nagamine Hajime, attached to a flight squadron; Airman, First Class Okuro Shigeo of a flight squadron. The above members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron, the Shikishima Squadron, encountered a group of enemy fleets centered on four medium-sized aircraft carriers near Suluan Island on October 25, and carried out a courageous ramming attack, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and damaging another, rendering it inoperable, and sinking a cruiser. They achieved extremely great results. The members deeply understood righteousness and were incomparably loyal and courageous. In addition to praising their achievements in a separate document, this is hereby announced to the entire army for their information.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Taiwan and the Philippines Wins Victory, Laying the Initial Foundation for Certain Victory</h3>
<p>Minister of Propaganda Lin Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Allied forces won a great victory in the naval battle of the Philippines, giving the enemy Americans a fatal blow and laying the initial foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Minister of Propaganda Lin issued a statement on this, and the original words are recorded as follows: The Allied forces have continuously achieved unprecedentedly great war results in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines in recent days. The good news has been spreading frequently, and all one billion people of East Asia are deeply inspired. Since the Quebec Conference, the enemy Americans and British have decided to adopt an offensive in the Pacific. For months, the enemy Americans have been waiting for an opportunity to move, wantonly bombing the mainland and deliberately scorching the earth, disregarding humanity. In the Pacific, they have concentrated their brutal isolated forces and gone deep into enemy territory, ignoring the taboos of military strategists. Recently, they cunningly attempted to succeed in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. The Allied forces waited at ease and seized the divine opportunity, resolutely launching an attack. They not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy forces, but it will not be difficult to gather and annihilate the enemy forces that landed on Leyte Island, which has lost maritime contact. The Allied forces' operations this time can be said to have achieved great strategic success. The enemy Americans and British still boast of their material superiority, and use this to play with boastful propaganda. However, facts speak louder than words. If they thought that the air force could rampage, why would the battle of Taiwan end in such a rout? If they thought that the navy could win, why would the battle of the Philippines result in such heavy damage that it was almost impossible to rescue? On the contrary, the Allied soldiers, for the sake of their country and East Asia, are not afraid of hardships and do not hesitate to sacrifice. Their bravery in battle can be said to be moving to the gods and causing wind and rain. This is deeply admired by the one billion people of East Asia, and even the enemy Americans and British are chilled by it. This is truly a manifestation of the unique spirit of the East Asian nation, which cannot be imagined by superficial Western materialists. Even if measured by material strength, the same strength, when used ten thousand miles away, compared to a thousand miles away, the disparity in proportion is truly astonishing. Judging from this, the loss of combat capability in this defeat of the enemy Americans, considering the supply in terms of space and time, is at least equivalent to four times their numerical losses. Although the enemy Americans boast of their abundant material resources, they cannot but admit the difficulty of utilizing their material resources. Now the Greater East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, and this victory is the initial foundation for laying the final victory. The enemy Americans have not given up their ambition to dominate East Asia, and it is expected that they will make a desperate gamble and stage a comeback. Our country is a link in Greater East Asia, and our survival is closely related to it. We hope that our compatriots in China and the entire East Asia will rise up together, intensify their efforts, strengthen rear production, strengthen combat power, and gradually become one with the soldiers at the front, holding onto the belief in certain victory, and striving for the brightness of China and the liberation of East Asia.</p>
<h3>Three-Power Conference of Anti-Axis Nations</h3>
<p>Location in Negotiations</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports, Exchange Telegraph reports from London: London, Washington and Moscow are currently busy discussing the location for the year-end meeting of the Big Three. Due to Churchill's advanced age, it is not advisable for him to travel long distances in winter, so the meeting place should preferably be not far from London. De Gaulle was not invited to attend the meeting, but Churchill will go to Paris to hold talks with De Gaulle before the meeting is held.</p>
<h3>Watching the Red Leaves in the Western Hills</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>Every year around the Double Ninth Festival, the maple leaves in the Western Hills of Beijing turn red. A few days ago, a friend of mine happened to fly here from Shanghai, so we decided to take a car out of Xizhimen together five days before the Double Ninth Festival. There is an asphalt road from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace, which is magnificently constructed, so the car ride on it is exceptionally comfortable. In particular, looking back at the scenery of the fields in the western suburbs of Beijing, one can feel a sense of openness. It is said that this beautiful asphalt road is the only political achievement in North China after the Incident. Otherwise, the roads before the Incident would have been badly damaged by now. We only need to look at the road from the Summer Palace to the Western Hills, which used to be a good road! But today it is abandoned and unrecognizable. I haven't walked this road for two years, and many new constructions have been added on both sides. For example, when you pass Weijiacun and approach Pangjiazhuang, you can see a tall building with a strong Manchurian architectural style. This is the North China Equestrian Testing Ground.</p>
<h3>Visiting Cheng Yanqiu at Qinglong Bridge</h3>
<p>After passing the Summer Palace, we arrived at Qinglong Bridge. At that time, one of my friends suggested visiting the famous actor Cheng Yanqiu. It turned out that Cheng Yanqiu had retired from the theater world after the Greater East Asia War and was very familiar with my friend. He had been living a secluded life there since last year. Although I have no interest in Peking Opera, I heard from my friend that the general young ladies in Shanghai are now learning Cheng's Peking Opera style, which shows that there is a great situation of [no tune without Cheng]. Why don't I go and see him? We immediately stopped the car in Qinglong Bridge Town and asked the shops for directions to Mr. Cheng's residence before walking into a narrow alley and arriving at the door of No. 3. We knocked on the door and entered. The courtyard was very quiet, but I saw a pile of millet in the courtyard. An old servant led us into the main room, and as the door curtain moved, Mr. Cheng greeted us with a smile. At that time, he was only wearing a pair of black trousers and a black cotton short jacket. Whoever saw him would never know that he was the once extremely popular Peking Opera actor Cheng Yanqiu! Because I have never liked Peking Opera, I have never seen his plays, but I also know that he is a very dramatically accomplished person. He used to have close contact with Li Shizeng and ran a theatrical monthly magazine in the former capital. At that time, he very much wanted to improve the Peking Opera of our country, but this magazine has now been discontinued. It is really unexpected that the impact of the Incident has also affected actors!</p>
<p>We talked for about half an hour. Because of the limited time for sightseeing, we said goodbye without being able to talk freely. However, in this half hour, I also learned a lot of things. It turned out that Mr. Cheng had given up his singing career two years ago. His biggest reason is that he no longer needs to sing to make a living. When he heard me say that Mei Lanfang was also not singing in Shanghai, he said: [We are all getting old now, and our children have all grown up. It's a bit embarrassing to do this again! Moreover, the purpose of singing is nothing more than to fill our stomachs. Since we can live without singing now, why bother to suffer? ]</p>
<p>I felt very sympathetic to Mr. Cheng's current life at that time. His home is still in Beijing, but he lives here alone. Every morning, he runs to a vineyard not far from here. It is said that the vineyard is more than sixty acres in size, so it is enough for him to live on. His eldest son was sent to Geneva by the World School ten years ago. At that time, readers may still remember the Geneva International Academy, which was founded by Li Shizeng to cultivate future talents. The World School selected more than a dozen young Chinese children to study there, and Mr. Cheng's eldest son was one of them. According to Mr. Cheng, his son is now twenty years old and has entered the University of Geneva. Time is really too fast. Thinking back, I also studied at the University of Geneva fourteen years ago. The scenery of Lake Geneva is still vividly in my mind! He also has two sons studying at the Affiliated High School of Fu Jen Catholic University, and a young lady studying at the Women's Normal High School, all in Beijing. Finally, we also talked about Mr. Li Shizeng. It is said that he is nearly seventy years old and has married a German lady in the United States. The joke ended there, and we hurriedly said goodbye and got back in the car to move forward.</p>
<h3>Visiting Ancient Sites at Yelu Chucai's Villa</h3>
<p>The car arrived at the foot of the Western Hills and could no longer move forward. We first went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. After lunch, we abandoned the car and used donkeys to go to Biyun Temple first. Speaking of Biyun Temple, today it can be said that no one in the country does not know it, because in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the coffin of the National Father Sun Yat-sen was first placed here. Therefore, there is still a clothing and hat tomb here, and there is a garrison office, and the person guarding the clothing and hat tomb is still a Cantonese from Guangzhou. However, the so-called Biyun Temple has a very ancient history. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was the villa of Yelu Chucai. Yelu Chucai was a very meritorious figure in our country, and this is a historical fact known to everyone today. According to the tour guide, Yelu Chucai is now not only worshipped by the people of our country, but also admired by many Allied people. It can be seen that in our country, regardless of whether he is a national or not, as long as he has contributed to our country, even a foreigner can be unforgettable to the people of our country forever. According to the inscription on the stone tablet here, Biyun Temple was donated as a temple by Yelu Chucai's son Ali Ji. In the Ming Dynasty, the famous eunuch traitor Wei Zhongxian used this as his living tomb, but Wei was later killed in Guizhou and did not have time to be buried here. It can be seen that a lifetime of treachery is ultimately difficult to fulfill!</p>
<p>Walking into the gate of Biyun Temple, we saw the four large characters [Shadow Red Silent Illumination]. We first went to the Arhat Hall to visit. There are five hundred golden Arhats inside, and the room is full of six Tibetan golden characters. It is said that the pronunciation of those six characters is [Om Mani Padme Hum], which means the same as when we recite [Namo Amitabha]. Inside the gate of Biyun Temple, there is a stone tablet first, and behind the stone tablet is a Buddhist hall. The Buddhist hall displays Buddhist statues of Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin, Manjushri, and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas. Behind the Buddhist hall is the main hall, namely the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which displays the National Father's portrait and a coffin model. The front is filled with wreaths from important officials of the National Government placed on the National Father's death anniversary on March 12 this year. However, when the reporters and others went to pay their respects, the memorial hall was being renovated, so these furnishings were moved to a room next door. Behind the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall is the clothing and hat tomb. We were led by the Cantonese who guarded the tomb to the roof to view the scenery of the entire city of Beijing. Because the weather was particularly clear today, with not a single white cloud in the sky, I smiled and said to my friend, it is really a blue sky and white sun tour of the Western Hills!</p>
<p>My friend said that before the Incident, Biyun Temple and Fragrant Hills were respectively managed by two politicians: Li Shizeng managed Biyun Temple, and Xiong Xiling managed Fragrant Hills. Therefore, in the early years of the Republic of China, Li established cultural undertakings at Biyun Temple, while the orphanage founded by Xiong is still at the foot of Fragrant Hills. Unfortunately, we were limited by time and did not have time to visit the orphanage, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>Red Leaves in Fragrant Hills Reflect the Double Clear Villa</h3>
<p>It is not very far from Biyun Temple to Fragrant Hills, but it is not easy to explore the entire view of Fragrant Hills, so we decided to still use the method of riding donkeys to go up the mountain to see the red leaves! Coming up the mountain, we saw that the maple leaves had already turned red all over the top of the mountain, symbolizing the light of fire. Everywhere there, you can see the villas of past dignitaries or bankers. We first sat in the Half-Mountain Pavilion for a while, and then dismounted from the donkeys at the Double Clear Villa. The so-called Double Clear Villa was originally the place where Xiong Xiling and his wife rested during their lifetime, but at that time Xiong's wife was still his original wife. We walked into the villa and saw a clear water encircling the courtyard, and the goldfish inside were floating and sinking freely. My friend walked into the courtyard, but there was no one inside, and it was so quiet that everything seemed dead! He couldn't help but sigh, saying: [The living reality has all become history]! It turned out that he used to be very familiar with Xiong, and Xiong's new wife, Ms. Mao, is still often seen in Shanghai. He asked the person watching the house: [Does Madam Mao still come here often?] The old man said listlessly: [She came north once this spring, but she only went to Tianjin to take care of private matters, and soon returned to Shanghai.] My friend lingered there for a long time, murmuring: [What a pair, one three-three, one six-six!] So we walked across the pond. To the north of the courtyard, there is a long stone table with many seats, probably the place where Xiong held banquets in the past! There was a couplet written by Emperor Qianlong hanging there, which read: [Green bamboos fill the courtyard to behold the Dharma's appearance, White clouds fill the valley to recognize the ancestral style,] which is a very good piece of calligraphy.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Double Clear Villa, we arrived at the only scenic spot in Fragrant Hills, which is the Zhaomiao Temple and the Jianxin House that we often see in pictures. The Zhaomiao Temple has now been converted into the Fragrant Hills Branch of the Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College of Peking University, which is a bit of a mood killer! Walking past the Zhaomiao Temple, we saw a scenic spot with pavilions and painted buildings. The so-called Jianxin House is actually the temporary palace of the Qing Dynasty emperors when they came to Fragrant Hills. There is also a clear pool there, with withered lotuses remaining in the pool. I think it must be very cool in summer. Inside the Jianxin House, there are more traces of the Qing Dynasty emperors' brushwork, especially Qianlong's. I didn't have time to remember them all. Coming out of the Jianxin House, we rode our donkeys to the Fragrant Hills Hotel to have some tea and snacks. There are still lodgings available there, with rooms costing only twenty yuan per day, which is much cheaper than in Beijing, but the facilities are too poor. There used to be many hotels in the Western Hills area, but some were destroyed by artillery fire during the Incident. Finally, we picked some red leaves and rode our donkeys down the mountain, and then changed cars and returned. On the way back, we originally wanted to go to Jade Spring Hill and the Quiet Bright Garden again, but it was already too late. The Quiet Bright Garden was originally as famous as the Quiet Pleasant Garden in Fragrant Hills mentioned above, especially the spring water there is excellent. The soda water here is made by drawing from the spring. Unfortunately, it is too cold and the soda water cannot be bought anymore, so we had to return to the city disappointed.</p>

<h3>Joint Commemorative Lecture by the News Association</h3>

<h3>Talk by Minister Usami</h3>
<p>On this occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Mr. Usami, the Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, delivered a speech, the main purpose of which was to strongly promote the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan and to resolutely destroy the British and Americans who obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship. His speech is as follows:</p>
<h3>Great Victory Makes Significance Profound</h3>
<p>It has been two years and ten months since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. Coincidentally, our army fiercely attacked its old enemy in the Pacific and achieved a historically unprecedented victory. The anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is greeted at this time, and its significance is extremely profound. The relationship between China and Japan, whether viewed from the four perspectives of geography, history, ethnicity, and culture, should be one of good friendship and alliance. However, in recent years, the relations between the two countries have gradually deteriorated, eventually leading to armed conflict, resulting in the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937, which has not yet been completely resolved, which is deeply regrettable. The reason for this, although due to improper measures by the responsible authorities of both countries, and if a thorough review is added, the fundamental reason is that the East Asian policy of the United Kingdom and the United States is to use counter-espionage and bitter schemes to obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship, and neither China nor Japan is aware of the British and American treachery. This is indeed the process of internal strife in East Asia, and people from China and Japan have gradually reflected and become aware. As a result, the peace movement arose in China, and then the National Government returned to Nanjing. As a result, the policy of the United Kingdom and the United States to alienate Sino-Japanese relations became even more blatant, so as to make the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan fight permanently.</p>
<h3>Defeat Britain and America to Realize the Ideal</h3>
<p>Until recently, both China and Japan have realized that Japan has launched the Great East Asia War to destroy the British and Americans, in order to sweep away the great enemies that obstruct Sino-Japanese relations. The two major ethnic groups of China and Japan have joined hands and marched towards the road of defeating the British and Americans. Therefore, the Chinese National Government also declared war on Britain and the United States and established a permanent friendly foundation for the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, and based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, mutual understanding was achieved. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was established on this day last year to clarify this principle, comply with each other, and establish a Sino-Japanese friendship. The establishment of friendly relations is not only an obligation for the governments of both countries to practice, but also an obligation for every national of both countries to practice. In order to actively achieve this goal, a comprehensive war of force, economy, and ideology is launched against the British and Americans who hinder Sino-Japanese friendship. We must do our best in our respective positions and resolutely destroy the British and Americans to achieve the common ideal of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. There are great expectations for this.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Economics Actively Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, he summoned the chairmen of various guilds for instruction. Xu, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Economics, actively suppressed and stabilized prices, launched the economic police to implement a city-wide general inspection, and closely contacted all parties. In addition to entertaining Chinese and foreign journalists from the city at the Huamao Hotel the afternoon before yesterday and clarifying the significance of this general inspection, he also convened the chairmen of various industry guilds in the city for instruction in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM yesterday (29th), strictly ordering each guild to follow the government's regulations and assist the government in suppressing and stabilizing prices, so that this unreasonable price increase trend would be completely stopped in order to stabilize people's lives. Tao, the Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, spoke on behalf of Minister Chen, hoping that the chairmen of the guilds would understand the government's sincere intention to suppress and stabilize prices, lead the industry to cooperate with the government, and work together to complete the goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices. He spoke many encouraging words. Then, the chairmen of the guilds put forward their opinions. Director Xu explained them item by item, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Main Items in the City Will Be Re-issued</h3>
<p>Regarding the comprehensive distribution certificates for main items in the entire Nanshi area, they have been completely distributed. The Material Distribution Office is currently making careful statistics. Once everything is ready, all items such as rice, yellow beans, flour, and coal briquettes will be re-issued separately within days.</p>
<h3>A Week of Industrial and Commercial Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai. Last week, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the outline for strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai Special City, stipulating the enrichment of the content of financial institutions, increasing capital, restricting loans, and the strong suppression and stabilization of prices by the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, together with the Economic Security Office to conduct a city-wide warehouse inspection, thoroughly punish hoarding, and crack down on illegal price increases, which has made speculators dare not act rashly. Finance has become more stable, and the price increase trend has turned flat. Banks and money houses have stopped mortgaging major commodities and are calling in loans. Silver has become looser. Gold has been falling since Monday until Friday. However, the market suddenly turned up again on Saturday morning. Tael silver and silver dollars remained stable. Because of the urgent need for joint banknotes, the market price has always tended to be higher. As for stocks, the trend of various stocks has been weakening due to the suspension of loans and collection of debts by banks. The situation in factories and industries has not changed. Although major items of industry and commerce have adjusted power consumption, the start-up production rate has not been reduced. The market prices of rice, miscellaneous grains, and food products were flat from Monday to Saturday last week. However, rice and grains saw a peak again on Saturday. The reason for the increase in gold and rice and grains on Saturday is that those who generally have funds and hoard daily necessities have shifted their targets to buy gold or store rice and grains, and holders take the opportunity to control them, causing the market price to rise in the opposite direction. However, this situation is the end of the road for speculators and can hardly affect the general price increase.</p>
<h3>Director Dai of the Education Bureau Convenes a Tea Party with the Principals of Private Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau, for the first time yesterday (29th) at 3:00 PM at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road, invited more than 30 principals of private secondary schools in the city to discuss in detail issues such as the reforms that should be made in the city's education, the welfare of faculty and staff, and tuition fees for the next semester.</p>
<h3>Gambling and Profiteering Are Not Allowed in Hotels and Apartments</h3>
<p>The police authorities are strictly investigating and cracking down. In order to refresh the city's appearance, the municipal authorities have thoroughly banned the atmosphere of smoking and drugs. However, the police authorities found that some unscrupulous criminals disregarded the law and discipline, opened hotels and apartments, gathered crowds to gamble, and profited from commissions, which was illegal. Therefore, they ordered each branch bureau to strictly investigate and crack down. The Lao Zha branch bureau, in view of the fact that the area under its jurisdiction is a gathering place for public entertainment venues, so the above-mentioned gambling trend is the most intense, ordered each public venue not to allow gambling and ordered its subordinates to strictly investigate and crack down. On the day before yesterday, they arrested gamblers Wu Amao, Tong Yuenian, Tong Zaiyi, Wu Yisheng, Fan Fuliang, Shi Ruixiang, Lin Yongzuo, Zhou Ruilan, Shao Xiangkang, Tong Yuanfu, Lin Chengyao, and Li Sushi in Room 427 of the Xinhui China Hostel, and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office together with the gambling equipment for investigation and handling in accordance with the law. It is also reported that if there is any such situation in the future, the person in charge of the hotel will also be investigated and cracked down in order to curb the evil trend of gambling and maintain local security.</p>
<h3>The Young Women's Christian Association Actively Donates</h3>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association hosted a banquet for the donation committee at the Kang Le Restaurant the day before yesterday for the purpose of raising donations. More than 20 people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Yan Huiqing representing Mr. Xi.

Therefore, it can achieve this good result. This fundraising campaign of 8 million will definitely exceed the target.</p>
<h3>The Baojia Office Explains the Issue of Self-Defense and Exemption from Service</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of exemption from service for teachers and staff of this city in the Self-Defense Corps on duty, Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, specifically clarified and explained to reporters yesterday that the exemption from service for teachers and staff has been stipulated before 1935 and is limited to public schools. However, after the incident, after the Baojia organization was formed and the Self-Defense Corps was organized, there were no regulations for exemption from service except for public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, and doctors. Afterwards, the teachers and staff of this city applied for exemption from service based on past regulations and due to their duty to educate students. After consultation with the relevant authorities of the allied nation by the former 18 two districts and 132 police stations, it was stipulated that the exemption from service for teachers is limited to the teachers and staff of public schools and the staff of private schools who are responsible for educational work. Now, in this city, all exemption from service issues, after weighing various circumstances by this office, include public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, school teachers and students, doctors and pharmacists, lawyers and accountants, journalists, and those with disabilities or special circumstances. Regulations for exemption from service have been formulated, and detailed methods have been approved and promulgated, and have been published in various newspapers in this city.</p>
<h3>Exemption Procedures for Journalists</h3>
<p>Also, the realization of exemption from service for journalists has never been stipulated in the past. After repeated consultations and discussions by this office, it was concluded that those engaged in journalism have been working hard to serve the society and local areas and have been doing their utmost to report. Therefore, the Health Committee, which is subject to the Baojia Regulations, is now organized as a Propaganda Committee, and Propaganda Committee branches are organized in each district under this office. All journalists in the city may participate. Now that they have participated in the propaganda and Baojia responsibilities, they can be exempted from self-defense duty.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Ping Pong Championship Finals: Lianyi Defeats Jingwu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ping Pong Team Championship Finals were held at the East Asia Stadium (Xiqing) starting at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (28th). Lianyi and Jingwu competed for the championship. After seven major battles, Jingwu was completely wiped out. Lianyi won all seven matches and won the Shanghai championship. Among them, the battle between Chuan Qifang and Lu Hanjun was the most exciting. After the game, movie star Chen Qi presented the awards. The overall champion was Lianyi, the runner-up was Jingwu, the third place was jointly won by Post Office Workers and Hezong, the fifth place was China Electric, and the sixth place was Yuelian. The results of the battle the night before yesterday are recorded below: Lianyi Jingwu Chuan Qifang 3-1 Lu Hanjun Wang Youxin 3-2 Ouyang Weizhou Ke Gang 3-1 Gu Jinxiang Huang Zhijun 3-2 Han Dewei Xue Xuchu 3-1 Zhang Ying Huang Zhijun 2-0 Lu Hanjun Chuan Qifang Ouyang Wei Wang Youxin 2-1 Zhang Zhihong Xue Xuchu Gu Jinxiang</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Cup Basketball: Tonight, Hualian vs. Huanan</h3>
<p>There will be three more games in the Shen Bao Cup basketball tournament tonight. They will be held in the gymnasium of the Japanese Army Dormitory (old West Qiao Youth Association) starting at 6:30 PM. Ticket prices have been adjusted. Upstairs tickets are sold for 100 yuan, downstairs tickets are sold for 200 yuan, and special seats are sold for 300 yuan. All income will be used to help the newspaper's scholarship fund. The first act is a match between Chen Lan of Division B5 and Zhenyuan. The latter is stronger and is expected to win. The second act is a match between Huaying of Group A and Team V. Since joining the war, neither army has benefited and has always followed behind. Huaying was unable to have all of its soldiers present due to filming, which created an awkward situation. According to the evaluation of strength, Huaying should be among the best, and the team has famous generals such as Shushi Cheyao An Baosongyuan. It is no accident that Team V can be included in the Group A lineup. Usually, they work hard and strive to make progress, so they have succeeded, but their experience is slightly worse and their performance is not ideal. The team's style has always been slow, and Yi Yu Zibin is the soul. The battle between the two teams is tantamount to giving way to each other, and the excitement is expected. The final act is a match between Hualian and Huanan of Group A. Hualian is known as the basketball hegemon of modern times, and its combat power is indeed strong. An Xia, such as Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, and Fan Qinggong, are all veterans who are good at fighting. Huanan has always been known as the Little Overlord. Liu Minkun Zhong is called the Liu Family General. They are short and capable and have great characteristics. He Jingui, Li Ruixiong, etc. all have refined skills. The outcome of this battle is related to the championship. It is not known who will win the title of Overlord. The order for today and the lineups of the two Huas are recorded below: Chen Lan Zhenyuan (B5) 6:30 PM, Huaying Team V (Group A) 7:15 PM, Hualian Huanan (Group A) 8:15 PM. Hualian: Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, Fan Qinggong, Jin Changchun, Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhen Zuoliang, Xu Jusheng, Yan Ziling, Zhang Xianlun. Huanan: Liu Fookei, Liu Fooshun, Liu Fooqiang, Ho Kung-kui, Li Hin-kwon, Li Shui-hung, Kwan Luk-sang, Tang Ying-ki.</p>
<h3>○Yesterday's Group B Results</h3>
<p>Tie Fu won against Eagle Team 22-15, Wing Team won against Qiang Shi 26-23, Renyu won against Fanjiang 50-18, Zhongchu won against Sanlian 29-24, Qingxie won against Feihong 41-16, and Shan Team won against Yuelian 27-19.</p>

Also, the Phoenix Cup basketball award ceremony was scheduled to be held at the Huaying General Administration Stadium on Huashan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday, but it was postponed due to the rain. The time of issuing the report yesterday was 7:50.</p>

<p>Special Edition Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance</p>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese Alliance and the Defense of East Asia</h3>
<p>Today, last year, China and Japan concluded the Alliance Treaty, which is not only an epoch-making page in the history of Sino-Japanese relations, but also an unprecedented and completely new page in the construction of East Asia. Recalling the breakdown between China and Japan caused by the Lugou Bridge Incident, it was resolved three years later due to the establishment of the Basic Relations Treaty. Three years after that, last year, the Alliance Treaty was finally concluded with the unanimous enthusiasm of both China and Japan. It was agreed to respect each other's territorial sovereignty, maintain eternal friendship, and further establish an alliance relationship for the construction of Greater East Asia. The impact of this development of Sino-Japanese relations is not only the future of China and Japan, but also the future of the entire East Asia, and even the construction of a new world order. Today, due to the changes in the world situation, the peace movement can no longer be just for peace between China and Japan, but should be a major movement for peace in East Asia and even the world. The peace movement, from its launch, brewing, to the return of the National Government to the capital and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the restoration of normal relations with Japan, is an initial success of the peace movement. Because comprehensive peace has not yet been realized, the Great East Asia War broke out. Therefore, the peace movement has developed into cooperation with the Great East Asia War in order to achieve peace throughout East Asia. On January 9 last year, the National Government officially announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States and participated in the Great East Asia War. The peace movement has also developed into a world character, hoping to thoroughly destroy the old forces of Britain and the United States that dominate the world. However, in this There is one point that Japan never forgets and wants to strive for, that is, China's independence and autonomy. Under this fundamental national policy and long-term world vision, Sino-Japanese relations have inevitably progressed from the Basic Treaty to the Alliance Treaty. What China requires is the completion of independence and autonomy. This has been achieved in the conclusion of the Lvshang Treaty, which has become the result of the peace movement, which has been proved in fact. From this time on, the relationship between China and Japan is no longer just for the two countries, but is enough to determine the fate of East Asia and even the world. This argument has become even more convincing today. Because under today's Great East Asia war situation, the attempts of Britain and the United States to counterattack, to restore their ambitions to dominate East Asia, and the fact that Yu Fang is willing to be used by Britain and the United States to delay the war of resistance, all make it necessary for China and Japan to cooperate more closely for the survival of the two countries themselves and the survival of the entire East Asia. Because the revival of China and the defense of East Asia have no way to self-defense and self-existence other than attacking Britain and the United States and completely crushing their ambitions. Therefore, from the Sino-Japanese alliance to the defense of East Asia, this has a consistent meaning. In order to practice the alliance and revive China, in this final decisive battle stage, we must fully cooperate with our ally Japan in an all-round way to defend East Asia, which is also for the independence and freedom of China. Only in this way can we truly practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. The successive victories of the Allied forces in Taiwan East and the East Sea of the Philippines in the past three weeks have made the one billion people of the entire East Asia unanimously excited. Today, when we commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese alliance, we expect that only by taking the mood of being on the front line and making unremitting efforts to crush the enemy's counterattack attempts and shoulder the mission of defending East Asia can we do so.

<h3>Mainland War and the Decline of Chongqing-America</h3>
<p>Regarding the war on the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army is attacking the enemy American forces on one side and advancing towards the vicinity of Guilin on the other. That area is the largest base in South China, built by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing at the enormous cost of 70 million yuan, and has been the source of their dream of air raids against Japan for the past few years. However, the Japanese army, having crushed countless enemy base groups and relentlessly pursued the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing into the interior, will soon seize this large base. Stilwell and Chennault's dismay is even greater than that of Chiang Kai-shek, who relies on the United States. This is written by an American war correspondent; the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had long abandoned Xue Yue's Chongqing army and retreated to the safe interior. The demolition unit remaining behind, under Stilwell's orders, blew up this luxurious flying base. The American war correspondent's retreat report states that only Chinese people are dying in the Guilin area. Last time Wuzhou fell, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing not only strictly ordered the Chongqing authorities to forcibly evacuate the citizens, but also set fire to the streets of Wuzhou from the air. Judging from the examples of Wuzhou and Guilin, the enemy American forces everywhere regard themselves as the protagonists of the Chinese front, and for the sake of their own operations, they often sacrifice the Chongqing army and Chinese citizens. Chinese people are not people, but merely a means to fulfill American ambitions. Therefore, they implement a scorched earth tactic on Chinese cities. This American attitude is bound to provoke the resentment of thoughtful people in China, and the following saying has arisen in Chongqing: "[The United States] has changed from an aid-giver [援將] to a disaster-bringer [導將]." This American military force, mainly composed of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, now dominates the Chinese front. The Chongqing army is nominally an allied army, but in reality, it is a sub-colonial army of the United States. They regard the Chinese front as an important wing of the Pacific front, attempting to attack Japan from both sides, and are pursuing the strengthening of their combat power with fervent desire. In reality, this attempted American military force, due to the Japanese operations in China, is taking precedence step by step, giving a major impact to the entire Greater East Asia War situation. Therefore, they cannot but attach importance to the successive defeats in China. During the retreat from Guilin, they said: "[Our being here], in this moment of defeat, will prolong the war between Japan and the United States by six months." They hope to open up a desperate path for the progress of the Pacific offensive. Chiang Kai-shek, directed by the United States, is also like this. In his closing speech at the last参政会 (People's Political Council), he admitted the disastrous defeat of the U.S. Air Force and Chongqing army stationed in Chongqing today, saying: "The Chinese front is a part of the world front, in which forty-one allied nations participate and is closely linked with other fronts. We have suffered defeats, but on the other hand, our allied forces have won victories, which offset our defeats." Subject to the whims of others, this is the current situation of Chiang Kai-shek, who follows the United States. Out of the friendship of the same East Asian race, we cannot help but extend a word of sympathy. However, what the United States and Chiang Kai-shek expect is in the Pacific, and the more profound the retreat and changes in the Chinese front, the stronger this tendency becomes. The correlation between the Chinese front and the Pacific front becomes clearer and more significant due to the enemy's approach. The enemy's cries of sorrow in China, and the direction of the enemy's offensive in the Pacific, indicate that the task accomplished by Japan's operations in China is greater than the defense of the homeland. Furthermore, the Greater East Asia War is a continuous series of decisive battles, and at the same time, it is a long-term war in essence. Therefore, it is necessary to change the way of thinking about the position of the Chinese mainland in the current great war. (Translated from the October 5th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Rapprochement with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The mainland operation, which aims to encircle Guilin from the north and south, is progressing day by day. On the 27th of last month, they also carried out a surprise landing near Fuzhou, making prior arrangements to block the American operational intentions. Since the Hunan operation in April of this year, the Chongqing army's continuous defeats and the recent urgency of the Guilin crisis cannot but bring about changes in the politics of the Chongqing regime. Chongqing's rapprochement with the Soviet Union is one of them. Originally, for Chongqing, which lacks independent war-dragging power, the diplomatic route is a major issue related to its life and death. At the beginning of the China Incident, Chongqing's diplomatic route was directed towards all countries except Japan. However, after the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact, the connection with Germany and Italy was severed. After the Greater East Asia War, it exclusively approached Britain and the United States, especially the United States, up to the present. Today, the center of gravity of Chongqing's diplomatic route is concentrated in the United States. Before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in Chongqing's view, the Soviet Union was also a central route, but due to the start of the German-Soviet war, Chongqing's dependence on the United States accelerated, and the route to the Soviet Union seemed to be forgotten, leading to the conflict with the Soviet Union in Xinjiang Province at the end of last year. However, recently Chongqing began a very obvious rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Under the pretext of enhancing friendship with the Soviet Union, Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, was ordered to resign, and Wu Zhongxin was appointed as his successor. The external liaison officer of Dihua was replaced, and Liu Zeyun, the former Chongqing counselor in Moscow, was appointed, with the intention of renewing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In the People's Political Council last month, a proposal was put forward to strengthen Sino-Soviet cooperation and send an envoy of goodwill to the Soviet Union. According to foreign news reports, Soviet Far East Minister Litvinov will arrive in Chongqing. Also, due to the reorganization of the Chongqing regime, Chen Cheng replaced the anti-communist He Yingqin and advanced, and pro-Soviet giants such as Sun Ke and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party rose to prominence. It can be clearly concluded that Chongqing is once again shifting its diplomatic route towards the Soviet Union. So, what kind of attempt does this urgent rapprochement with the Soviet Union represent for Chongqing? As a result of the successive failures of the mainland operation, the rhetoric of distrusting Chongqing's fighting power has recently become prevalent in the British and American camps. Roosevelt and other war leaders do not hesitate to publicly declare it, and Churchill also openly stated in parliament the unreliability of the Chongqing army in the decisive battle. At the same time as this British and American slander of Chongqing, the Chongqing regime's resentment towards the United States' overreach and post-war ambitions is quite high, even to the point of the emergence of arguments for the suspension of American loans and attacks on pro-American factions. Chongqing's recent rapprochement with the Soviet Union is a reaction to this problem with the United States. Secondly, what currently perplexes Chongqing is the unresolved issue of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Although the Chongqing talks following the Xi'an talks were somewhat forcibly reconciled by Wallace and others, they have worsened, and Zhou Enlai ultimately made a statement of dismantling the stage. Chongqing cannot help but refute this. According to foreign news reports, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, and other CCP giants gathered in Yan'an to secretly discuss countermeasures. Chongqing's rapprochement with the Soviet Union is a search for a way out due to the unresolved issue of the Kuomintang-Communist relationship. However, in the current state, no matter how close it gets to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union believes that the current American aid to Chongqing is clearly useless. Moreover, the Chongqing regime will not sever ties with the United States. Therefore, the power of the United States has deeply penetrated the heart of Chongqing. On the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Yan'an regime is still in an offensive position. Attempting to resolve this opposition by relying on the power of the Soviet Union will, on the contrary, increase the power of Yan'an. In short, by strengthening the route to the Soviet Union, if one wants to block the ambitions of the United States and resolve the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the result will ultimately be failure. However, the fact that they finally have no choice but to resort to this inferior strategy shows how confused the Chongqing regime is today. (Translated from the October 5th Dokusho Hochi)</p>
<h3>Crisis of the Chongqing Regime: Vicious Inflation Causes Economic Collapse</h3>
<p>The Chongqing regime, which has been dragging on the war for as long as seven years, faces an economic collapse crisis caused by extreme vicious inflation. The following article is an article entitled "The Endless Chinese Inflation" recently published in the famous American magazine "The New Republic." It is entirely a report of the actual situation. The author, Eric Sevareid, narrates that the Chinese people in the anti-Japanese war zone are facing the line of starvation and loudly shouts that this is the price of dragging out the war with Japan. The following is the translation: The extreme vicious inflation taking place in the Chongqing辖境 (administrative area) is virtually unique in the world since Germany created an unprecedented record in 1923. A few weeks ago, the reporter saw dark green airplanes – bombers and fighter planes, etc. – flying from India at a certain large airfield in Chongqing, and at another corner of the airfield, he saw beautiful transport planes with the white words "[China National Aviation Corporation]" landing. A sea of people, coolies, carried heavy boxes out of those many transport planes, and then carefully loaded them onto combat-heavy vehicles. These boxes were filled with Chongqing banknotes transported from the United States. This is an injection for the Chongqing economy oppressed by the heat. Most of these banknotes are made by the American Bank Note Company of New York, but all of them are ten yuan or more. This means that almost no ten-yuan bills are needed for eating and buying things. This kind of banknote is transported from the United States, across the Pacific Ocean and India, to Chongqing every month, more than just a few tons. What the Chongqing regime is racking its brains over is how to massively print banknotes to match the monthly increase in prices of 10%. The amount of banknotes in circulation has already reached an astonishing figure, so the Chongqing regime does not have the courage to publish the actual figure. In some places, prices are 250 times higher than in 1937. The current legal price of one U.S. dollar is 20 法幣 (legal tender), but diplomats and foreign journalists are allowed to exchange one U.S. dollar for 30 法幣. However, the black market has reached 80 to 90 yuan, so the purchasing power of one yuan of Chongqing 法幣 is actually only equal to five cents of U.S. dollars. What one yuan of Chongqing 法幣 can buy is half a pack of low-quality cigarettes, half a catty of peanuts, or six sheets of typewriter paper. If you take a bus with one yuan of Chongqing 法幣, you can only travel three or four li (Chinese mile). Buying a new pair of leather shoes costs 500 yuan of 法幣, and an old raincoat costs 1,500 to 1,600 yuan of Chongqing 法幣. Isn't this staggering? The reporter ate an ordinary meal with three other people in a Chongqing restaurant, which cost 400 yuan of Chongqing 法幣, which is really ridiculous. Because Chongqing cannot import consumer goods from overseas, but Chinese stores are full of luxury goods. (Translated by An from the October 4th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Announcement to the People of Chongqing – Broadcast Speech by Chief Matsushima –</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Chinese Fleet, gave the following broadcast to the people of Chongqing from the Shanghai International Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 8:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month, targeting Mr. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs of the Chongqing regime:</p>
<h3>Heavy Damage to the Mobile Force</h3>
<p>Today, I would like to inform the beloved people of Chongqing about the results of the great naval battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines: What the US military is most anxious about is to quickly land the MacArthur forces in the Philippines in order to establish contact with the Chinese mainland, but this time the US side suffered unexpectedly huge losses, which were caused by this kind of rude action, which I believe you must already understand. I reported to you on the 22nd of this month that the US military, in order to assist MacArthur's landing, ordered Halsey to attack Japan, Taiwan, and the Ryukyus, but this move ultimately failed due to the ambush of the Japanese army. However, the US military did not retreat because of this, and attempted to forcibly land on the Philippines. Finally, since October 18th, they began to attack Leyte Island, which is located in the middle of Mindanao and Luzon. Prior to this, the Japanese air force in the Philippines had captured the enemy's mobile force proceeding on the sea east of the Philippines and inflicted great damage on it. However, the enemy's land forces dared to start attacking a corner of the Philippines. The Japanese side, seeing this situation, considered it a rare opportunity, and finally dispatched the Combined Fleet, which had been waiting for an opportunity since the beginning of the war. However, the enemy did not know this. After suffering huge losses many times, the MacArthur forces were finally able to land on Leyte Island, build a fragile bridgehead, and advertise widely that their attempt had succeeded.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships' Heroism Surprises the Enemy</h3>
<p>On the 22nd of this month, I happened to hear the broadcast of Chongqing and heard Mr. He Yingqin, whom I trust most, praise the US military's landing on the Philippines, and believe that the connection between the Chinese mainland and the US military has been completed and is overjoyed. I was very surprised after hearing this. The US military's dream desire has reached the time when it will be destroyed by us. Our Combined Fleet, with a large formation of powerful battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, dared to carry out an attack that is not easy for even immortals to do. It appeared in the Philippines and fiercely began to attack the US naval and land forces. Regarding the heroic actions of the Japanese fleet, Admiral King, the commander of the US Combined Fleet, made the following remarks: "It is admirable that the Japanese fleet can pass through the Surigao Strait, which is not easy to turn around in. There must be an incredible reason behind its ability to take this action." Mr. He Yingqin, you have studied in Japan, please deeply consider Admiral King's words. What the American admiral cannot judge and understand is the greatness of the Japanese navy. This kind of fact cannot be calculated with numbers, and it should not be discussed on the same day as aircraft, warships, and other objects.</p>
<h3>Naval Gunfire is the Best in the World</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese fleet finally appeared on the sea east of the Philippines. The Japanese fleet has been focusing on the research of shipbuilding technology for more than 20 years since the Washington Conference, so that it has today's sophisticated and strong battleships, and it has obtained the essence of training that surprised Admiral King, and the day to show its skills has come. After the fierce airborne attack, the power of our battleships, which continue to fire from a close range of 20,000 meters, can be called the best in the world. The enemy ships could not withstand our artillery fire and had no way to escape, and repeatedly sent telegrams requesting assistance. The power is so great that one can get a glimpse of it. The Japanese fleet further broke into Leyte Bay, where enemy transport convoys and escort warship groups were gathered, performing a full martial arts show like the Water Margin to chill the enemy's hearts. Leyte Bay suddenly became a sea of fire. The enemy's transport ships and warships, with soaring flames, destroyed seven aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two cruisers, sunk eight aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and two destroyers. In addition, 13 cruisers and destroyers, one oil tanker, five ships of unknown type, and 18 transport ships were destroyed or sunk in Leyte Bay, and 500 aircraft were shot down over the Philippine Sea, and 72 were destroyed in Leyte Bay.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Battle Results of Taiwan and Philippines Waters</h3>
<p>The comprehensive battle results since the start of the battle on the waters of Taiwan are as follows: 34 aircraft carriers, 7 battleships, 14 cruisers, 4 destroyers, 4 cruisers or destroyers of unknown type, 47 transport ships or more, 16 ships of unknown type, 16 large boats, and 1 oil tanker were sunk or destroyed, totaling 154 ships or more. The US military in the Pacific has lost almost half of its strength, especially most of the enemy's most precious battleships and aircraft carriers have been buried at the bottom of the sea. This fact deserves the attention and surprise of the world. As for the loss of personnel, it is about 500,000 people. The United States is still using the excuse that the investigation has not been completed and does not dare to publish the results of the battle, and is trying to deceive the world, but the fact is the fact. The United States has suffered a huge blow. Not only is it unable to capture the Philippines, its Pacific operation plan has been seriously hindered. On the 27th of this month, the US Navy Day, President Roosevelt did not specifically mention the situation of this naval battle, and reluctantly kept silent, which is a piece of evidence. The Imperial Navy immediately reorganized its formation and further carried out the annihilation of the enemy forces landing on Leyte Island. The final result of this naval battle will ultimately determine the future trend of the war between Japan and the United States. In addition, the British fleet, which had acted recklessly in Nicobar, was attacked by the Japanese air force and suffered heavy losses, and fled in panic, which was miserable.</p>
<h3>The Valor of the Special Attack Force</h3>
<p>I would also like to mention the "[Kamikaze Special Attack Force]" announced by the headquarters at 15:00 today. I am unable to disclose the mechanism of this weapon, but this new weapon can only be operated by Japanese or Chinese people, that is, people who understand the spirit of East Asia. Mr. He Yingqin should also be able to understand it. Captain Seki and the other four of our naval aviation warriors operated this new weapon and crashed into the aircraft with their bodies, destroying two American aircraft carriers and one cruiser. It is nothing more than the ardent Japanese soul, and the divine skill that chills the hearts of Americans can also stir the ears and eyes of the people of the world. Their loyalty and courage will surely be remembered for generations to come. People of Chongqing: The great East Asian spirit or the original power of East Asians can be exerted to this extent with only effort. Relying on the British and Americans to become their slaves, and having their dignity completely trampled on, is this the way to save China? I hope that you will restore the true nature of East Asians as soon as possible, and connect with the right track. I cannot help but hope for it.</p>
<p>Guilin Defeat Record</p>
<p>— Written by an American War Correspondent</p>
<p>The Japanese army's attack on Guilin is a sign that the enemy's largest forward base for the counterattack against Japan is about to collapse. Recently, the American "Time" weekly published an article by American war correspondent Teddy White's "Guilin Defeat Record," which caused a great response. The following is an excerpt from the article, describing the accurate portrayal of the US and Chongqing forces in Guilin, which were in chaos due to the Japanese army's attack, destroying military facilities, and retreating. When the Anglo-American military high command in Quebec was holding a conference to end the war around the table, the Greater East Asia War was proceeding smoothly, and the Japanese army began to drive out the air force led by Chennault (commander of the US Fourth Air Force in China), the largest forward base in South China "[Guilin]". This place reveals the signs of America's defeat. Many people have experienced the military failures of the Allies in 1942, but few people know the same military failure that occurred last week. Before suffering this major blow, the US and Chongqing forces had fought a major battle for two weeks south of Hengyang. The continuous fog every day meant that the US air force's superiority could not fully exert its power, and as a result, they had to bid farewell to Guilin, and the sun was shining in the sky, but "[time was late]", and the US military retreated under the guidance of Chinese soldiers.</p>
<h3>The Chaos of Weapons</h3>
<p>The weapons for defending the entire province of Guangxi and Guilin can be said to have everything. Among them are American-made cannons, Soviet-made tanks, and Japanese-made and Chinese-made artillery. Among them are also cannons that have been used as much as possible, and there are also cannons that cannot be used at all. Xue Yue, the commander of Chongqing, led 4,000 subordinates, but only half of them, 2,000, had usable rifles. The unit did not even have the wood needed for cover, nor did it have signal flags to contact American aircraft, and there was no radio to contact the detachments from the unit headquarters. The Japanese army is not like this. It not only has power but also has mobility. No matter where it is, it can satisfactorily dispatch superior forces. We originally wanted to stop the Japanese army's advance north of the entire county, near Huangsha River, about 140 to 150 kilometers northeast of Guilin. However, this road was taken by the Japanese army four days before our plan. Many air bases in Guilin had to evacuate, destroy, and abandon within 26 hours. Soldiers and telescopes were also prepared to evacuate. In order to carry out uninterrupted operations against Japan, they were still carrying out their last mission in Guilin, and then fled south in the dark night. In order to find the contact line of the rear base, Major General Clinton Vincent and two combat staff officers, Dibamann and Deved, set off on the last plane early the next morning. Only the demolition unit led by Colonel Wald Knudson was left behind, and the final decision was made to blow up the airfield and buildings.</p>
<h3>The Pitiable Form of Refugees</h3>
<p>Once in the suburbs, we saw the last batch of refugees, either sitting in rickshaws, carriages, or walking, all pouring into the road endlessly, showing a pitiable form, and escaping on the road. In the city, which was forbidden to pass through, soldiers were desperately preparing the machine guns that were about to be used, digging trenches, and building defenses. On the morning of the day Stilwell approved the final retreat, he, along with Chennault and US military officers, visited Zhang Fakui, the commander of Chongqing, to discuss the military situation, and the US military officers received maps and aerial photos. Stilwell ordered to set fire and began to retreat. After a few hours, they left. All the barracks in our valley were set on fire, and every soldier in the demolition unit was holding a bucket of gasoline. The buildings were blown up one by one, and finally the entire valley was burning with flames. Sometimes, the entire roof was blown to the ground and shattered into pieces of fine tiles. The fire swallowed the buildings like a torrent. Flames of yellow, red, and white colors were burning the houses. The demolition bombs were constantly sounding around us like firecrackers during the Chinese New Year. Sometimes it felt like being hit by a boulder. Just for one of our airfields, the number of buildings that needed to be destroyed reached as many as 550. The cost we invested in this airfield was as high as 700 million Chinese 法幣 (legal tender), which is 70 million US dollars. When we blew up the runway for combat aircraft, it was already slightly dawning. We ran to the dining hall to eat the last bacon and eggs. Major General Wingate said to me: "[About this war, I want to write a book]". He said that the title of that book would be "[Flames, Downfall, and Retreat]".</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Purpose is to Eliminate the US Military</h3>
<p>We do not know whether the Chongqing army will defend Guilin to the death. They are fighting bravely. And the thousands of people who died along the river and on the city's defense barriers were all Chinese, but this war is our common war, that is, our common failure. The Japanese army has many purposes for this war. For example, in order to not be threatened by American aircraft and submarines on the sea, to seek the only southern land route, to defeat the latest army of Chongqing, and to politically shake the Chongqing government, etc. However, these purposes are all secondary. The main purpose of the Japanese army has always been to reduce the US military and occupy American air bases. We know that this defeat in Guilin will prolong the war between Japan and the United States by six months. The Japanese air force bombed this base of ours late last night, so we all slept in the long air-raid shelters all night. Someone told me that the US Navy landed on Palau Island today. I ran to an officer and asked if the landing was a fact. The officer replied: "[Huh? Palau Island? These guys can't help but rush to land, can they?]" (Translated by An from the October 4th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
