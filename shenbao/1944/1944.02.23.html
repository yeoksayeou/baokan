<h3>駐印渝英軍　惡感益增</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電駐印渝軍因不滿英美軍之橫暴，其反感益增，最近重慶方面對此似頗感苦慮。據息，最近重慶曾派遣熊式輝張冶中徐永昌三人，赴印緬國境方面調查該問題之實情，以謀着手解决，能式輝等三人日前巳返抵重慶，就調查之結果加以報吿，據稱一，英軍與渝軍之中級幹部間，完全缺乏連絡，且互相間欠缺意思之疏通，二，由於飛機之缺乏，陸軍與空軍之協力作戰，殊不能推進，且英美空軍並未予渝軍以援助。三，渝軍與住民之感情惡劣，即與一印軍之感情亦未能融治，是故印渝軍均有離印之慮云。</p>
<h3>社評　緬印作戰檢討</h3>
<p>沈寂已久之緬印邊境，近於日軍奮男果敢之行動下，巳將耽耽窺邊的英印軍擊潰，現正節節進展中。在此西南太平洋戰局緊張之時，何以日軍復將劍鋒指向緬印呢？其理由不外下列數端：</p>
<p>英美已放棄戰事重心歐陸第一之主張，而進入「中央突破」之太平洋決戰階段。渝英欲乘西南太平洋多事之秋，反攻緬甸，恢復主要輸血路綫，故日軍起而先發以制敵。</p>
<p>緬甸為昭南島之前哨，昭南島為南洋羣島之門戶，故確保緬甸，即所以鞏固南洋羣島。</p>
<p>鮑斯氏所領導之印度國民軍，得由是作進一步之活動，促進全印民族運動，使印民奮起以驅逐英國統治勢力，擺脫百年來英國殖民政策之東縛，以求獨立自主，恢復東亞人之東亞。</p>
<p>現在再就以上三點作進一步的研究。第一，最近英美的改變作戰策略，在歐陸取政治攻勢，在太平洋則取「中央突破」攻勢，已甚明顯。歐陸方面，英美極力拉攏中立國，其目的不僅在軍事上欲使德國陷於狐立，實因不願蘇聯坐大，故高唱一時之第二戰綫，姗姗來遲。在東亞方面，則鑑於日本軍需工業生產量之突飛猛進，如再坐誤戎機，則更將一蹶不振，故不惜孤注一擲，在西南太平洋及緬印邊境冒險反攻，以期收「中央突破」旁敲側擊之功。</p>
<p>第二，南洋羣島，為軍需資源之寶康，而昭南島又為南洋羣島之咽，緬印地發為昭南島之屏範，商軍如欲奪回軍需寶庫之南洋擊島，則緬甸為必爭之地。今日軍不待英印軍之蠢動，即先發制敵，使其潰不成軍，實予敵方覬觀公理以極大之打擊。</p>
<p>第三，印度自一八五七年被英國統治以後，其民族先覺，無時不在反抗掙扎中。自大東亞戰爭發動後，印度志士遂起而為祖國自由奮鬥，組成印度國民軍，以德里為進攻之最後目標，民族獨立自主的呼聲，當可響應全城，發展為如火如荼的救國運動，使英國統治勢力為之震驚，尤為緬印作戰之最大效用。</p>
<h3>納吐諾鏖戰　大炮數千尊齊發</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期日納吐諾橋頭堡戰事復起，情况劇烈，常時英軍向德戰綫發動步兵進攻之前，大砲數千尊一齊出動，聲似雷鳴，達數小時之久。敵之主要企圖在於爭取阿普里亞迤南德擲彈兵所佔領之區域，敵在一處突入德軍之防禦系，但德軍立即在戰車掩護下發動反擊，並子敵以重大死傷後，將其逐出，由於英美軍强大之部隊，德軍之損失亦甚重大。英美空軍於是日上午在阿普里亞之南最為活躍，同時德空軍則不斷襲擊沿海岸之卸貨區與英美軍之砲位，多處發生大火。</p>

<p>南太平洋戰局，如拉巴爾，馬紹爾諸役，日益激烈。正凝集國人視聽之時，緬甸方面日本陸軍部隊。對於在在其頓阿恰布方面　動的英印軍，展開了攻其無備的果敢行動，同時印度國民軍協助日軍，軍行所至，勢如破竹。</p>
<p>為響應南太平洋之反攻，蒙特巴頓部下之英印軍。須迅速在印度洋及緬甸有所行動。以分散日軍兵力，而收夾擊之效、此係獎國所熟烈要求，甚至與論囂然，有叱責蒙特巴頓之怯懦者。於此情况之下，印度　內駐屯五十萬英印大軍，重慶軍復絡續增援、第一綫空軍，英美合計且達千餘架，再加海上以錫蘭鳥為中心，結集英國地中海艦隊的主力，虎視耽耽，戰機有一觸即發之勢，以最近布其頓阿恰布方面英印軍之蠢動推測，則戰機已迫、日軍豈能坐視此重大戰機，遂以疾風迅雷之勢，攻其無備、予敵軍以痛擊。同顧自去秋怒江作戰以來，緬甸幾次戰役，日軍無不出之以神速，制敵之機先，今於太平洋及緬甸兩方面敵正以夾擊作戰相號召時，乃先發以制敵之機。此作戰對於日趨激烈之太平洋戰以及全局影書之重大，無待整曾。吾人一方面深慶大本營發表之捷音，同時對於此番參加協力作戰之印度國民軍之踴躍健鬥，祝禱無巳。（韋庵：　自二月九日讀賣報知社論）</p>
<h3>對緬印英軍德總攻擊</h3>
<p>先發制人，是一切戰爭的要諦。日本緬甸派遣軍，最近對於自機反攻的緬南阿恰布英軍精銳，施以先發制人的空陸相呼應之總攻擊，於敵軍部隊之包圍，以及後方輸送路之截斷等、着着收得戰果。大本營亦發表該方面戰况順利。此與去冬怒江流域之先發作戰，以及阿拉干山脈之悲劇同其神速，國民對之，期望甚股。</p>
<p>依據吾人所開之捷報，該方面之作戰，有鮑斯氏所率之印度國民軍參加協助，正向印度國境進擊。鮑斯氏日於是日闡明印度國民軍按照預定計劃開始行動，抱具「履行解放祖國的嚴　誓約」之決意。此番作戰，前途固屬大難，但　所謂天時地利人和三者，於此緬印國境之爭，日軍可謂得其人和，日軍後方，現正激起民族解放之高潮，緬甸現在脫離英勢力之桎梏，整個民族傾心於建國大業。故印度民族解放武裝戰士之印度國民軍挺身於獨立自主建國大業之細甸民族，以及　起大東亞解放旗幟之日軍，在此一職中，可稅是展開了三位一體得東亞民族共同戰綫。</p>
<p>而在敵軍方面，英美渝各軍，作戰目標既異，又且各自為政，作利己打算。最近在印度之美軍，正在策查動員英渝兩軍，便之響應太平洋戰綫，而作為對日戰綫之正面。但　印國境主力之英軍，口頭儘嚷着對日攻勢，內心專注意於强化印度防衛，以及奪回綱甸。至於渝軍，除〇企圖重開緬甸公路，促進英美援助外，他無所求。如此同牀異夢之英美渝軍，其汲汲於爭奪司令權，以至相互攻　之醜態、固屬理所當然，實亦使人曲冷。再視印度之現狀又為如何，藉戰學時期之名，英國正在儘量榨取，惡性通貨膨脹、飢饉與癘疫，使數百萬印人皆將喪失其生命。開戰以來，英國的彈壓政策，如國民運　指導者之投獄，民衆運動之武力彈壓等，一時雖把印度民衆的崛起阻止了，但其將戰　遂行之基礎，置之於印度國土，人口，資源之極度剝奪上，其對於印　統治之末日，恐怕也為期不遠了吧。</p>
<p>敵軍中利害衝突之　態，並非緬印綫之特微。我人且坦然承認敵軍　有利害衝突之處，其於抗日一點，團結甚固。且緬印國境之戰，其意義不僅為緬甸攻防戰，亦復為對日總反攻之一環。與歐戰相並行，英美之欲於本年內在柬並舉行决戰，可於其對蘇聯及重慶之政略，短期戰路論，以及內外政治之背水陣等等獲悉之。去秋以來　巡已久之英印軍，其聯合美渝軍、出而作全力反擊，巳毫無疑義。大東亞戰爭之决戰，巳迫在眉睫。先發制人，非僅為戰塲之鐵則，即於後方，何莫不然，凡我國民切望覺悟今日正為千鈞一變之决戰關頭，而共同努力。（　庵譯自二男十日朝日新聞社論。）</p>

<h3>切實執行</h3>
<p>實業部當局在滬召開之物價速絡會議，討論結果，咸以「目前物價狂漲，非因供求關係，或貨品成本高漲的必然趨勢，而多麗於類似操縱的人為原因。除治本方面如增加生產疏運來源，已由實業部竭力進行外，治標方面應切實厲行戰時物價管理條例及實施辦法，並由各地經濟行政富局即日施行。」我們昨天曾獻言「標本統籌」。並指出過去管理物價的機構與辦法，未嘗不完備不周密，而未能收效者在於「執行不力」與「執行不當」。現在會議討論結果，决定由實部「竭力進行」治本的增產與疏運，由各地經濟行政當局「切實厲行」戰時物價管理條例及實施辦法。我們很試摯的盼望各級當局澈底做到一竭力進行」與「切實厲行一，使過去因「執行不力」與「執行不當」而形成物價高漲紊亂局面的錯誤，今後不再重見。對於這次會議規定的抑價辦法，務必「切實執行」，尤其對於私抬物價及囤積居奇者，嚴格引用戰事懲治特例，物價是人民切身問題，所以大家須嚴切注視國積居奇的復活，及早檢舉遏制，不使蔓延。</p>

<h3>The War Situation Enters a Critical Stage: Japanese Prime Minister Expresses Resolve to Strive for Victory with an Active and Decisive Spirit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) After the cabinet reshuffle, the first regular cabinet meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Prime Minister Tojo, Finance Minister Ishiwata, Agriculture Minister Uchida, Transportation Minister Goto, and all other cabinet members attended. Prime Minister Tojo reported on the recent replacement of the three key ministers and the close coordination measures taken between national affairs and supreme command. He then expressed the government's significant determination to address the current tense war situation. The cabinet members exchanged opinions until the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) Following the cabinet reshuffle on the 19th, Japan implemented measures on the 21st to strengthen the coordination between the supreme command and the government, aiming to achieve complete unity in political and military affairs and establish a decisive battle posture. During the cabinet meeting on the 22nd, Prime Minister Tojo expressed his determination to actively implement policies and achieve political and military objectives. The gist of his statement is as follows: Today's war situation is extremely critical. The enemy has already attacked the Marshall Islands and subsequently air-raided Truk. We anticipated the enemy's counter-offensive. The current war situation is indeed profound and difficult to be optimistic about. We must overcome this stage to pave the way for certain victory. Therefore, today marks a critical moment for the empire's survival. At this juncture, we must further strengthen the coordination between supreme command and national affairs. In operations, we must resolutely implement strategic and tactical measures. In national affairs, we must concentrate all the nation's material and human resources to defeat Britain and the United States, ensuring that there are no worries in the rear during operations. This is the key to securing the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. The supreme command has grasped the current war opportunities and is striving for sound planning and courageous fighting to achieve certain victory. The government is also taking today as a turning point and is determined to overcome all difficulties to meet the demands of the war. Today marks a defining moment in completing the Greater East Asia War. We can only realize this resolution today. Any past shortcomings should be rectified to strive for victory. We should start anew, regardless of any praise or criticism, and exert all our strength to achieve success. I hope that all of you, in implementing your respective administrative duties, will not be swayed by past inertia and regulations, and will adopt decisive measures. Because in the current stage of the war, if national strength does not directly contribute to the completion of the war, it will leave regrets for millennia. We will have no way to answer to the Emperor, let alone face our ancestors or descendants. I have carefully considered the policy for dealing with this significant situation and am rapidly studying its specific methods. I hope that you will thoroughly cooperate in this regard. Indeed, at this moment, our active and decisive spirit is the key to public service. To cope with the ever-changing war situation and achieve our intended goals, the responsibility of our commanders at all levels can be summarized in the four characters 'active and decisive.' This is by no means an overstatement. At this time of crisis, subordinates are paying close attention to the attitude of their commanders. The commander's strong determination and ability to make timely decisions are more crucial than ever. In short, Japan is now facing a critical war situation that will determine its rise or fall, and we are taking today's measures as a turning point. We have made a great and courageous resolution, and there must be a way to overcome the difficulties. I now share with you my determination to achieve certain victory and pledge to repay the country with my life. By ensuring the mutual consistency of political and military strategies and thoroughly implementing active and decisive policies, we can achieve the Emperor's great undertaking and ensure the stability of the nation.</p>
<h3>General Chief of Staff Bao's Remarks</h3>

With centralized command and integrated political orders, the supreme command can achieve the highest level of thorough, confidential, swift, and consistent execution. The certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War is further ensured, and the liberation and construction of the entire East Asia can be completed at an early date.

<h3>Resentment of British Troops by Chongqing Troops in India Increases</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Chongqing troops stationed in India are increasingly resentful of the tyranny of the British and American troops. Recently, Chongqing seems to be quite concerned about this. It is reported that Chongqing recently dispatched Xiong Shihui, Zhang Zhizhong, and Xu Yongchang to the border region of India and Burma to investigate the actual situation of the problem and seek a solution. Xiong Shihui and the other two have recently returned to Chongqing and reported the results of their investigation. It is said that: 1. There is a complete lack of communication between the middle-level officers of the British and Chongqing troops, and there is a lack of mutual understanding. 2. Due to the lack of aircraft, the cooperation between the army and the air force cannot be promoted, and the British and American air forces have not provided assistance to the Chongqing troops. 3. The relationship between the Chongqing troops and the residents is bad, and the relationship with the Indian army is also not harmonious. Therefore, both the Indian and Chongqing troops are considering leaving India.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Review of the Burma-India Operations</h3>
<p>The long-dormant Burma-India border has, under the brave and resolute actions of the Japanese army, routed the British-Indian forces that were eyeing the border, and is now making steady progress. At this time of tension in the Southwest Pacific war situation, why did the Japanese army again point its sword at Burma-India? The reasons are no more than the following:</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have abandoned their advocacy of "Europe First" as the center of the war and have entered the "central breakthrough" decisive battle stage in the Pacific. The Chongqing British forces want to take advantage of the troubled times in the Southwest Pacific to counterattack Burma and restore the main blood transfusion route, so the Japanese army has risen up to strike first to制敌.</p>
<p>Burma is the outpost of Shonan Island (Singapore), and Shonan Island is the gateway to the South Seas Islands, so ensuring Burma is to consolidate the South Seas Islands.</p>
<p>The Indian National Army led by Mr. Bose can take this opportunity to take further action to promote the All-India national movement, so that the Indian people can rise up to drive out the British ruling forces, get rid of the shackles of British colonial policy for a hundred years, and seek independence and autonomy to restore East Asia's East Asia.</p>
<p>Now let's further study the above three points. First, the recent change in the British and American war strategy, taking a political offensive in Europe and a "central breakthrough" offensive in the Pacific, is very obvious. In the European continent, Britain and the United States are trying their best to win over neutral countries. The purpose is not only to make Germany fall into isolation militarily, but also because they do not want the Soviet Union to become too powerful, so they advocate a temporary second front, which is long overdue. In East Asia, given the rapid progress in Japan's military industry production, if they continue to miss the opportunity, they will be unable to recover. Therefore, they do not hesitate to take a desperate gamble and launch a risky counterattack in the Southwest Pacific and the Burma-India border, hoping to achieve the effect of a "central breakthrough" with indirect attacks.</p>
<p>Second, the South Seas Islands are a treasure trove of military resources, and Shonan Island is the throat of the South Seas Islands. Burma-India is the shield of Shonan Island. If the merchant army wants to regain the South Seas Islands, the military resource treasure house, then Burma is a must-争之地. Today, the Japanese army does not wait for the actions of the British-Indian forces and strikes first to defeat the enemy, giving the enemy who covets public reason a great blow.</p>
<p>Third, since India was ruled by Britain in 1857, its national pioneers have been constantly resisting and struggling. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Indian patriots have risen up to fight for the freedom of their motherland, forming the Indian National Army, with Delhi as the ultimate goal of attack. The call for national independence and autonomy can respond to the whole city, developing into a national salvation movement like a raging fire, shocking the British ruling forces, and is the greatest effect of the Burma-India operations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Nettuno: Thousands of Cannons Firing Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: The battle for the Nettuno bridgehead resumed on Sunday with intense fighting. Before the British forces launched an infantry attack on the German lines, thousands of cannons fired simultaneously, sounding like thunder, for several hours. The enemy's main objective was to seize the area south of Aprilia occupied by German grenadiers. The enemy broke into the German defense system in one place, but the German forces immediately launched a counterattack under the cover of tanks and, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, drove them out. Due to the strong British and American forces, the German losses were also very heavy. British and American air forces were most active in the south of Aprilia in the morning, while German air forces constantly attacked the unloading areas along the coast and the artillery positions of the British and American forces, causing many fires.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting in Krivoy Rog: German Retreat</h3>

<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Strikes First</h3>
<p>The war situation in the South Pacific, such as the battles of Rabaul and the Marshall Islands, is becoming increasingly fierce. While concentrating the attention of the people of the country, the Japanese army in Burma launched a bold and unannounced attack on the British-Indian forces moving in the area of Arakan, and the Indian National Army assisted the Japanese army, and the military advance was like a hot knife through butter.</p>
<p>In response to the counterattack in the South Pacific, the British-Indian forces under Mountbatten must quickly take action in the Indian Ocean and Burma in order to disperse the Japanese forces and achieve the effect of a pincer attack. This is what the Allied countries have been vehemently demanding, with even public criticism of Mountbatten's timidity. Under these circumstances, 500,000 British-Indian troops are stationed in India, and the Chongqing army is continuously reinforcing them. The first-line air force, British and American combined, reaches more than a thousand aircraft, plus the main force of the British Mediterranean Fleet, centered on Ceylon, is gathered at sea, watching with tigerish eyes, and the war opportunity is about to break out. Judging from the recent actions of the British-Indian forces in the area of Buthidaung and Arakan, the war opportunity is imminent. How can the Japanese army sit idly by and watch this significant opportunity? Therefore, they struck with the speed of lightning, catching the enemy unprepared and inflicting a painful blow. Considering that since the Nu River operation last autumn, the Japanese army has always been swift in the several battles in Burma, seizing the initiative to制敌. Now that the enemy is calling for a pincer attack in both the Pacific and Burma, they are taking the initiative to制敌. This operation is significant for the increasingly fierce Pacific war and the overall situation, which does not need to be reiterated. We are deeply pleased with the good news released by the Supreme Headquarters, and at the same time, we pray incessantly for the enthusiastic and vigorous fighting of the Indian National Army that participated in this cooperative operation. (Wei An: From the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun editorial, February 9th)</p>
<h3>General Attack by Anglo-Indian Troops Against Burma from Germany</h3>
<p>To strike first is the key to all wars. The Japanese Burma Expeditionary Force recently launched a preemptive general offensive, coordinating air and ground forces, against the elite Anglo-Indian forces in Akyab, southern Burma, who were launching counter-offensives. They have achieved successive victories, including the encirclement of enemy units and the cutting off of their rear supply lines. The General Headquarters has also announced that the campaign is proceeding smoothly. This is as swift as the preemptive operations in the Nu River basin last winter and the tragedy in the Arakan Mountains, which raises high expectations among the people.</p>
<p>According to our triumphant reports, the campaign is being assisted by the Indian National Army led by Bose, which is advancing towards the Indian border. Bose has stated that the Indian National Army has begun operations according to plan, with the determination to "fulfill the solemn oath to liberate the motherland." Although the future of this campaign is undoubtedly difficult, in the struggle for the Burmese-Indian border, the Japanese army can be said to have gained the advantage of timing, terrain, and popular support. Behind the Japanese army, a high tide of national liberation is rising. Burma has now broken free from the shackles of British power, and the entire nation is devoted to the great task of nation-building. Therefore, the Indian National Army, the armed fighters for Indian national liberation, are standing up for the Burmese people who are embarking on the great cause of independent nation-building, and the Japanese army, which is raising the banner of Greater East Asia liberation. In this endeavor, it can be said that they have launched a united front of East Asian peoples.</p>
<p>On the enemy side, the British, American, and Chongqing armies have different operational goals and are acting independently, pursuing their own selfish interests. Recently, the American forces in India have been planning to mobilize the British and Chongqing armies to respond to the Pacific front and serve as the front line against Japan. However, the British army, the main force on the Indian border, only pays lip service to an offensive against Japan, while focusing on strengthening the defense of India and regaining Burma. As for the Chongqing army, it only seeks to reopen the Burma Road and promote British and American aid, and has no other demands. It is only natural that the British, American, and Chongqing armies, who are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, are eager to compete for command and even engage in mutual attacks, which is truly chilling. Furthermore, what is the current situation in India? Under the guise of wartime, Britain is extracting as much as possible. Rampant inflation, famine, and epidemics are causing millions of Indians to lose their lives. Since the beginning of the war, Britain's repressive policies, such as the imprisonment of national movement leaders and the violent suppression of popular movements, have temporarily prevented the rise of the Indian people. However, by basing its war efforts on the extreme exploitation of Indian land, population, and resources, the end of its rule over India is probably not far off.</p>
<p>The state of conflicting interests among the enemy forces is not unique to the Burmese-Indian front. We should frankly admit that although the enemy forces have conflicting interests, they are united in their opposition to Japan. Moreover, the battle on the Burmese-Indian border is not only a battle for the defense of Burma, but also part of the overall counter-offensive against Japan. Concurrent with the European war, the desire of Britain and the United States to hold a decisive battle in Cambodia this year can be seen in their strategies towards the Soviet Union and Chongqing, short-term military theories, and the desperate situation of domestic and foreign politics. The Anglo-Indian forces, which have been maneuvering for a long time since last autumn, will undoubtedly launch a full-scale counter-offensive in conjunction with the American and Chongqing armies. The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War is imminent. To strike first is not only the iron rule of the battlefield, but also of the rear. All of our people must realize that today is a crucial turning point in the decisive battle and work together. (Translated by An'an from the editorial of the Asahi Shimbun on February 10.)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Convenes a Price Liaison Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday and Decides on Several Major Cases to Curb Prices</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, recognizing that the recent surge in prices has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, urgently needs to invite economic administrative authorities from the central and local governments, as well as commercial organizations, to conduct detailed research and decide on countermeasures. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, it convened a price liaison meeting at the Duchen Hotel on Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, bringing together the directors of economic bureaus from various regions, the presidents of chambers of commerce, and the chairmen of the commercial control commissions, rice control commissions, cotton control commissions, and various industry associations. The meeting was chaired by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who delivered an opening speech, clarifying the significance and purpose of the meeting. Subsequently, the directors of economic bureaus from various regions reported on the economic and price situations in their respective areas. The attendees discussed and studied major cases to curb prices until about 6:00 p.m., when the meeting adjourned. During the meeting, Minister Chen expressed his deep encouragement to the directors, chairmen, and representatives of other units, and declared his determination to handle the situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>In addition to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the heads of the ministry's agencies stationed in Shanghai, the attendees included Lin Dazhong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Nanjing Special Municipality; Chen Shushou, Director of the Economic Bureau of Jiangsu Province; Yu Yu, Director of the Economic Bureau of Zhejiang Province; Cai Wenshi, Director of the Economic Bureau of Hubei Province; Guan Chengbin, Director of the Economic Bureau of Qinghai Province; Wang Hanzhang, Director of the Economic Bureau of Anhui Province; Xu Tianshen, Director of the Economic Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality; Xing Jianquan, President of the Xuzhou Chamber of Commerce; Pan Ziqi, President of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce; Wang Wuquan, President of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce; Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, representing the city government; Su Chengde, Director of the First District Police Bureau (represented by Yao Shuyi); Zhang Yuzhai, representing the Second Police Bureau; Feng You of the Economic Department of the First District Office; Ji Hua, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau; Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce; Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Commercial Control Commission (represented by Luo Nazhai); Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee (represented by Shan Zhe); Chen Ziyi of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee; Wen Lanting, Chairman of the Cotton Control Commission; and over 50 chairmen of various industry associations.</p>
<p>Discussion Results</p>
<p>It was generally agreed that the current soaring prices are not due to actual supply and demand or the inevitable trend of rising costs, but rather to artificial causes such as manipulation. In order to suppress prices, in addition to addressing the root causes, such as increasing production and unblocking sources, which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is striving to do, as a temporary measure, the "Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Management" promulgated by the National Government and its implementation measures should be strictly enforced and implemented immediately by the economic administrative bureaus of various regions.</p>
<p>Price Control Measures</p>
<p>The prices of daily necessities should be quickly assessed in accordance with the regulations, and the prices limited to those before January of this year should be strictly enforced as the highest standard. To ensure the effective enforcement of price limits and the crackdown on the black market, the police, commercial organizations, and the public should be mobilized simultaneously to work together. The price management agencies should be strengthened and unified as soon as possible. Those who privately raise prices should be severely punished, and those who hoard, speculate, and manipulate profits should be punished in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Hoarding" and the "Special Criminal Law in Wartime." Industry associations should strengthen supervision of members who privately raise prices, and economic administrative agencies should punish those who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. Efforts should be made to unblock sources and increase the distribution of supplies in various regions.</p>

Recently, Sun was also appointed as the director of the section, and because it is currently the 33rd year for merchants to renew their licenses, the bureau issued an announcement yesterday, setting a deadline of the 29th of this month for merchants to apply for license renewal, in order to facilitate the review.</p>

<p>The Price Liaison Meeting convened in Shanghai by the authorities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce concluded that "the current soaring prices are not due to supply and demand or the inevitable trend of rising costs, but rather to artificial causes such as manipulation. In addition to addressing the root causes, such as increasing production and unblocking sources, which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is striving to do, as a temporary measure, the Wartime Price Management Regulations and its implementation methods should be strictly enforced by the economic administrative bureaus of various regions immediately." Yesterday, we suggested "overall planning of both root and branch." We pointed out that the institutions and methods for managing prices in the past were not incomplete or inadequate, but the failure to achieve results was due to "ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation." Now the meeting has concluded that the Ministry will "strive to carry out" the root-cause solutions of increasing production and unblocking sources, and the economic and administrative authorities of various regions will "strictly enforce" the Wartime Price Management Regulations and implementation methods. We earnestly hope that authorities at all levels will thoroughly achieve "striving to carry out" and "strictly enforce," so that the mistakes of the past, which led to the chaotic situation of soaring prices due to "ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation," will not be repeated in the future. The price control measures stipulated in this meeting must be "thoroughly implemented," especially those who privately raise prices and hoard goods for speculation must be severely punished in accordance with the special provisions for wartime punishment. Prices are a matter of vital concern to the people, so everyone must pay close attention to the revival of hoarding and speculation, report and curb it as soon as possible to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Resignation of Director Nie of the Cotton Management Office, the Commercial Control Commission Responds with a Letter Expressing Its Views</h3>
<p>Nie Lusheng, Director of the Cotton Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission, submitted his resignation to the commission. Yesterday, a reporter went to the Commercial Control Commission to inquire about the truth. According to the person in charge of the commission, after receiving Director Nie's resignation letter, Chairman Tang immediately sent Zhang Enhong, Director of the Finance Department, to visit Mr. Nie as a representative to inquire about the true meaning of the resignation. He was unable to meet him, so he inquired about everything in detail in writing. Because it was an internal matter, there was no need to make it public. Since it has been disclosed in the newspaper yesterday, we can only provide you with the Commercial Control Commission's response to Director Nie for your review. The full text of the letter is as follows: In response, I received your letter yesterday and learned of your decision to withdraw. I was very surprised after reading it. Although we have only recently met, the government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cloth this time and entrusted our commission to handle it on its behalf. At the beginning of the establishment, it was stipulated that it should be managed by the industry. Because you are the chairman of the Cotton Products Association, you were invited to take charge of the purchase work, and you resolutely came forward to accept it, for which I am very grateful. For the past half year, all administrative affairs have been managed by you. Although letters of inquiry and criticism from outside have arrived one after another, because they were not signed, they were all burned. I have repeatedly informed you, and you have repeatedly stated that you would never shirk your responsibility until the purchase work was completely completed. Therefore, in addition to admiration, I have tried every means to designate important members of our commission to assist in the sorting out of the past chaos. I am also grateful for your repeated expressions of gratitude for this sincere maintenance. I privately believed that cooperation would lead to a satisfactory conclusion. Now, you have suddenly sent a letter proposing your resignation without any prior discussion. What is the meaning of this? It is difficult to understand. I entrusted Director Zhang Zanong of the Finance Department to visit you as a representative, but you refused to meet him, leaving me confused. Now, I will answer the points you raised in your letter separately: The establishment of the committee is entirely to deal with the chaos in the purchase work. More than 3,000 letters have come from outside operators, and some of them cannot be resolved. Therefore, I discussed it with you and invited important personnel from our commission to participate in the assistance. Each person has their own task in their official capacity. Who would want to add more work? However, because they were designated and because of my friendship with you, and also because the commission and the office were difficult to manage, they worked day and night, and did not hesitate to work hard. You should feel grateful for this and should not misunderstand. I have also explained it to you in detail many times. As for the inspection work you mentioned in your letter, it is being handled in an orderly manner. This is indeed a misunderstanding. Inspection should be carried out in a proper order and with priority. We have clearly notified you that the cloths to be inspected are those that can be prepared for this temporary allocation, and the Cloth Industry Association has already submitted a request for this. Our commission has already forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for approval. Before the approval is received, the inspection should be temporarily delayed, and there is no other intention. The number of cloths that should be inspected still accounts for more than half of the total. How can you say that there is no inspection work? This is very clear. As for the more than 100 deposit slips that you mentioned have been processed, but the merchants have not come to collect them, merchants are eager to receive the deposit slips in order to turnover funds. If they have been processed, they should be promptly notified to collect them. This is a responsibility that our commission should bear, and it is definitely not enough to say that it is completed with only a little more than 100 copies. This is also a very obvious fact. As for the allocation affairs you mentioned that have been assigned to Deputy Directors Sun and Honda, I have discussed this matter with you in advance and stated that they are still responsible for the allocation under the supervision of the director, with the sole intention of relieving you of your burden and enabling you to handle the purchase conclusion work. Because the conclusion work has begun, it is stipulated that all external documents must be finally reviewed by you, and I will make the final judgment. The division of powers and responsibilities is clear, and all the regulations are in place. There is no falsehood. How can you say that the deputy directors are handling the allocation, and the conclusion is being handled by the committee, so you have nothing to do? This is a misunderstanding on your part. Now the purchase conclusion work is about to begin, and the allocation problem is also very complex. I am deeply relying on you. You have decades of experience as an operator and have a certain status in society. I rely on you to assist me. Unexpectedly, you suddenly disregarded everything, turned away, and left all the unfinished responsibilities and unhanded them over to me alone. It is difficult to understand both publicly and privately. Is it possible that I have offended you in some way, or that I have behaved improperly and you are ashamed to associate with me? We have been together for several months, and our friendship is not superficial. I cannot help but venture to express my words, hoping you can explain the matter to me. This is addressed to Director Nie of the Cotton Management Office, Chairman of the Board, and I implore you to enlighten me. Sincerely, The Cotton Industry Management Commission. 19th of February, 33rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
