<p>恭迎靈櫬一瞥</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　最高領袖汪主席崩逝噩耗傳出後，舉國哀悼，薄海同悲。主席靈櫬已於十二日下午五時三十分由日恭迎返京，中央委員及國府各院部會文武長官。暨盟邦在華軍政長官·德·義·滿等各友邦駐華使節·以及主席親屬等千餘人，均親蒞機塲恭迎。五時二十分海鹣號專用機飛臨首都上空，迥繞一週後，即於五時三十分在國樂聲中，海陸文武長官分成兩列，陳代主席隨即領導褚民誼·徐蘇甲·林柏生·陳君悉·李謳一，陳昌祖·陳泉·何炳賢等文武舁櫬人員，趨赴機前教最敬禮三鞠躬畢，全體進入機內，瞻仰遺容，由陳代主席領導，舁櫬各員恭扶靈櫬下機，同時奏哀樂，恭迎各員均肅立致敬，深致悲悼，全塲空氣極爲肅穆。恭隨主席靈櫬同來者計有夫人陳璧君中委暨公子女公子及行政院秘書長周隆庠等多人，靈櫬上蒙國旗，在哀樂聲中，恭扶下機後，隨即換乘靈車。靈車四週，環紮素絹，兩旁懸以國旗，即於萬分悲哀氣氛中啓行，行列首爲開導車，繼爲主席靈車，陳代主席恭隨靈車之後，再後爲儀義仗　舁機親人員車，末爲中央委員及各院部會長官曁其他盟友各邦駐華官員車共三豐餘輛，蜿蜒數里，沿途公務員軍警學生民眾等臂總黑紗，手持國旗，列隊恭迎，靈車經處，均鞠躬致敬，靈車由光華門　城，經中山東路·新街日·中山北路·鼓樓·保泰街·歷一小時餘迄七時許抵達國民政府，由陳代主席領導，仍由舁櫬人員扶櫬下車，進入國民政府大禮堂，恭迎堂中，隨即舉行恭迎儀式。全體肅立，繼奏國樂，主祭者陳代主席主持就位，並恭獻花圈，全體向靈櫬行最敬禮三鞠躬，靜默三分鐘誌哀，即於兩穆悲哀氣氛中宣告禮成，文武百官亦即魚　退出，日滿德義四駐華使節亦分別致祭。按昨日適逢國父誕辰紀念日，首都民眾曁緬懷國父倡導革命締造民國之艱巨，又得此國父遺志唯一繼承人汪主席崩逝噩耗，感慨之餘，更增哀悼，故全市民衆均列隊恭迎，自光華門至國民政府門前，踵趾相接途爲之塞，情緒之緊張·空氣之肅穆，誠前所未有。蓋國人深知汪主席爲中國國民革命之忠實信徒，早歲追隨國父爲國奔走，國父逝世後，則繼承遺志，領導同志貫澈革命大業。中日變起，目覩時艱，乃毅然發表艷電，倡導和運，迄二十九年五月領導組府還都，內求和平統一，外求敦睦邦鄰。大東亞戰爭爆發以來，更以同生共死之決心，領袖羣倫參加戰爭，同心協力，蔪求中國之復與，東亞之解放，以實現國父大亞洲主義之遺敎。故主席之死，豈僅我中國四萬萬同胞失一賢明之領導者，實亦爲大東亞解放以至於世界繁榮之前途一大損失。</p>

<p>出國治療經過</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　宣傳部發表公報如次：三十三年十一月十二日下午六時，國民政府汪主席痛於民國三十三年十一月十日申時，在日本名古屋帝大醫院逝世，距生於民國紀元前二十九年五月四日已時，享壽六十有二，謹於十一月十二日恭迎遺體回國成殮，擇期舉行國葬，飾終典禮由國民政府會同中央黨部組織哀典委員會敬謹辦理。</p>
<p>謹按汪主席於民國二十四年行政院長任內，出席四屆六中全會，遭暴徒狙擊受傷，經在國內，並出國療治，健康雖復，而留於背上之槍彈，以頻年奔走國事，迄未取出。自和運開始，憂勤過度，時覺痛楚。迨至去年八月底間背部胸部及兩協同時發痛，嗣後日愈加劇，乃於十二月十九日在京施行手術，取出子彈，當時經過良好，創口甫經平復，未得充份調養，即因國內國務叢集日理萬幾，本年一月中旬復發寒熱，創痛再起，艱於行動，然猶就臥穆處理要公，並時召幹部同志面授機宜，操勞無異平時，病體愈覺難支，始應醫勸易地撩治，於三月三日出國赴日入名古屋帝大醫院，由醫學界最高權威數人專任診治，盡近代醫學上可能之方法加以醫療。其間病狀時進時退。九月下旬，至十月初句約十日間，及由十月二十日起四日間，熱度曾超過三十七度五分，略有微熱，其他尚屬平穩，食慾良好，每日進食維持一千五百單位之熱量，大體與前無多差異，惟爲防止發生肺炎，急性心臟哀弱及其他雜病，已須特加注意。迨至本月十日上午六時，病狀劇變，熟度高至四十度六分，脈搏增至一百二十八度，食慾全無，呼吸困難，漸入危馬狀態，脊椎及骨盤部經前後七次Ｘ光施治，背腰之疼痛亦見輕鬆，食慾漸增，惟因臥床過久，全身衰弱愈甚，脈搏達九十度至一百十度，因背腰疼痛及咳嗽關係，睡眠亦受影響。九月初旬以來時發喀痰，且感困難，雖經注射强心劑及吸酸　素等，但鑑基於如此症態，竟於同日下午四時廿分逝世。病中時慮不起，每以和平。實現統一·民生疾苦解除爲念，勉勵國民黨全體黨員·和平運動全體同志·全國國民及靑年，對內奉行國父遺敎，實行三民主義，對外信守中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言，由努力獲得中國之獨立自由，進求東亞之解放，由協力大東亞保障中國之獨立自由。</p>
<p>溯主席後國父十七年而生，後國父十九年而死，追隨國父致力革命亦爲四十年，前二十年爲國父之翊贊者，後二十年則爲國父之繼承者，中國之獨立亞洲之解放，爲國父未竟之志，由主席繼起完成之，東亞百年大計方露曙光，竟棄同志與民衆而逝，凡我後死自應仰體遺志，以慰主席在天之靈。</p>
<p>日皇贈菊花章頸飾</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據名古屋電話謂，甲華民國國民政府主席在精衛氏逝世之消息傳出後，日天皇陛下，聆悉之餘，深爲軫悼。天皇陛下當聞悉汪主席病狀危篤之時，即以盟邦元首至高之禮，贈呈汪主席以最高榮譽菊花章頸飾。十一日上午九時半，在名古屋帝大醫學部附屬醫院貴賓室，於小磯首相之陪侍下，由重光大東亞相，謹向　培大　，轉天皇陛下所贈菊花章頸飾及誄詞。旋由蔡大便捧持天皇陛下所餽禮物，謹供於汪故主席靈前。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日本上下獲悉吾國汪主席逝世消息後，無不深爲悼借。僉以主席不僅爲中國之元首，尤爲東亞之先覺，自領導和平運動以來，爲中國復興，爲東亞解放，無時不傾力以赴。去年大東亞會議中，主席充滿顯意之演講，迄今猶深印日本國民之腦際。主席在日治療期間，各方對於主席病狀，尤格外關心，而常默禱主席早復康健。今突聞噩耗，竟有悲極而涕者，對於吾國之喪失一偉大領導者，一致深表同情。且深信吾國上下定能益堅團結，繼續主席遺志，努力奮鬥。同時更表示今後誓與吾國益加協力，共同邁進，以蔪求戰爭之完遂，東亞之解放。</p>

<h3 id="c3">敬悼　汪主席 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>國民政府主席汪精衛先生，不幸於本月十日逝世。噩耗傳來，全國震悼，在此大東亞戰爭決戰時期，國步維艱之際，驟失領導人物，實爲我國家的最大損失。</p>
<p>汪主席一生嘉言變行，誠是舉不勝舉，前此已有不少專集記錄，足供後人的景仰觀摩。而主席謀國之忠，用心之苦，治事之勤，赴義之勇，任難之毅，更足以爲後之報國者所取爲模範。近五年來，發動和平運動，抱「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的剪毅精神，不避鋒鏑，出生入世，不爲危難而稍變其志，奠定和遝基業。這種精神，尤足令人肅敬。</p>
<p>我們今天在敬悼汪主席逝世之際，同時，我們應該認識下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）汪主席是國父的繼承者，不僅對於國父的主義學說，發揚光大，尤其對於國父的遺志，力求賀現。國父遺志中，關係整個中國以至整個亞洲命運的大亞洲主義，必須由中日兩國合作才能完成。國父曾肯定的說過：「無中國即無日本，無日本即無中國」。所以，汪主席致力於中日合作，實現大亞洲主義。自從發動和運，中國參加大東亞戰爭以後，更進而締結中日同盟，共同發表大東亞共同宣言，至此，國父大亞洲主義逐漸具體形成而逐步實現。這是汪主席繼承國父遺志最重要的一事。</p>
<p>（二）民二十七年年底，汪主席發表艷電建議和平，其中說：「中國抗戰之目的，在求國家之生存獨立，抗戰年餘，創鉅痛深，倘猶能以合於正義之和平而結束戰爭，則國家之生有獨立可保，即抗戰之目的已達。……中日兩國讓地相接，善鄰友好有其自然與必要，歷年以來，所以背道而馳，不可不深求其故，而各自）明瞭其責任。今後中國固應以善鄰友好爲敎育方針，日本尤應令其國民放棄其侵華侮華之傳統思想，而在敎育上確立親華之方針，以奠定兩國永久和平之基礎，此爲吾人對於東亞幸福應有之努力。同時，吾人對於太平洋之安寗秩序及世界之和平保障，亦必須與關係各國一致努力，以維持增進其友誼及共同利益。」其後和平運動即以此爲根據調整兩國關係。五年餘來，事實已經證明和平政策的正確性，其間經逐漸演進，促成大亞洲主義的實現。現在汪主席雖然逝世了，可是，汪主席的遺志，應該繼續實踐是毫無疑義的，自從汪主席出國養病，半年餘來，國府幹部已能維持中樞政治，今後不但賡繼遺志，力求實現，更應刷新吏治，革新政治，對主席遺志更能發楊光大。同時，日本對華政策聲明不變，所以，對於和平政策以及中日同盟，大東亞共同宣言，今後只有更加推進，絕不會變更的。</p>
<p>當初汪主席創導和平運動時，也許大多數人未能諒解，可是，現在英美仍未放棄侵略野心，企圖倫中國大陸爲戰塲，而另方面則中日之間締結同盟，爲共同目標而努力，從此可證和平運動，確是自然而必要的。目前大東亞戰爭勝利基礎雖已奠定，但前途艱困尚多，仍待中日兩國的共同協力，以實現在主席遺志爲努力方向，隨慰主席在天之靈。</p>

<p>當時，主席以在此緊迫之時局下，各同志均努力苦幹，而余（主席自稱）一人，因病不能治事，深以爲憾。當晚主席之言辭，猶在目前，主席雖在病床，對國事無時或忘，但因身體之不能自由，深爲悶悶。</p>
<p>主席不及見興復中華，保衛東亞之實現，遽爾長逝，其必將引爲憾事也</p>

<p>汪主席自領導和運以來，在新中國之建設上，留有偉大之功績，爲國父遺囑巾廢除不平等條約之成功，奠定中國，完威獨立之基礎，凡此事績，今將永垂靑史。</p>
<p>去年十月三十日，中日同盟條約簽訂之時，本人曾爲主席祝福。去年今日，國父誕辰紀念日，於國父陵墓，舉行實現國父遺志祭吿禮，主席嚴服報吿撤廢不平等條一約時，本人以爲國父在天之靈，當必不勝欣快。</p>

<h3 id="c12">昨國父誕辰日　全市擴大紀念　各界民從舉行紀念大會 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>昨日爲國父七十九週誕辰紀念日，上午九時，本市各界民衆，舉行隆重紀念大會。同時市黨部與本市新運分會，靑少年團市團部，特聯合組織流動演講隊十隊，分別在全市各區出動演購，晚間市黨部主任委員劉仰山特在上海電台向全國民衆廣播。全市紀念盛况，至爲熱烈。</p>
<p>大會情形</p>
<p>各界民衆昨日上午九時，假大光明電影院舉行隆重紀念大會，計到市府各局處長梁秀予，蘇成德，葉雪松，陳秋實等，參加各界計有全市公務人員黨員軍警保田人員靑少年團以及民衆團體代表，不下二千餘名，市警察局樂隊特蒞場　樂，情緒振奮極爲熱烈。會場布置簡潔莊嚴，准時舉行儀式。主席袁履登。劉仰山等。行禮如儀後，首由袁履登致詞：略謂今日各界舉行大會，紀念國父誕辰，其意義在座諸君均已深切明瞭。國父艱苦卓絕創造中華民國，致力四十年餘，鞠躬盡瘁，爲革命而奮鬥，因此我人在紀念國父良辰之日，應實踐國父遺志，發揚國父精沖，値茲大東亞決戰之際，更應努力駢肩與盟邦日本排除艱苦，發大無畏精神，完成中華民國眞正之自主獨立云云。繼由市黨部主任委員劉仰山，本報社長陳彬龢相繼演說，語多警惕。繼由主席團代表梁秀予領導全體高呼口號：（一）實現一國父遺志，（二）貫澈革命主張，（三）打倒英美保衛東亞，（四）完成統一興復中華，（五）三民主義萬歲，（六）中華民國萬歲。乃奏業禮成，會後即放映華影大東亞新聞片及「凱風」電影，至正午十二時始散會員。</p>
<p>陳彬龢詞</p>
<p>本報陳社長演說詞略謂：今天是　國父孫先生七十九歲的誕辰，雖則國父逝世已將二十年了，可是，每年逢到國父的誕辰，全國國民莫不以最熱烈的心情懷念和追思，因爲國父領導革命締造民國的功勳，以及啓示我們應趨的方向，實在太偉大了。我們今天紀念國父誕辰，有三點値得提出的：第一，當民十三年十一月，國父在日本神戶，演講大亞洲主義，十四年一月，到北京宣言廢除不平等條約，迨至三月十二逝世前的遺囑中，仍以廢除不平等條約念念不忘，因爲國父認爲不平等條約是束縛國家自由的桎桔，非予廢除，無以完成獨立自主的國家。國父逝世以後，國內紛爭不已，不平等條約依然存在，直至大束亞戰爭發生以後，中國對英美宣戰，日本實施對華新政策，經日本的竭誠協力，始將各國所有在中國的祖界，一律交還，並撤銷領事裁判權，至此，百年束縛的不平等條約，得以廢除，國家的獨立自主，才能完成，對於國父所念念不忘的廢。除不平等條約，終於實現我們相信國父在天之靈，定必莞爾欣慰。其次自從中國參加大東亞戰爭以後，中日兩國締結同盟，由同甘共苦以至同生共死的密切關係，其後盟邦更發起大東亞各國會議，發表大東亞共同宣言，更確定了東亞各國家的互惠平等與共存共榮，迄今更實現了國父的大亞洲主義，相信國父在天之靈也必引爲欣慰的。</p>
<p>第二，民十三年　國父自日本返國時，曾對日本新聞記者說：「中日兩國國民，必須聯絡一致，同心協力，合成一個力去做，才可以成功，要分開成兩個力去做，一定是失敗，無論那一個都是失敗……不過兩國國民，各有各的希望，各有各的困難，以致彼此都想聯絡，都不能實行，研究到這個地步，中日兩國國民，非互相了解不可。」將近二十年前的時候國父已經指出中日兩國國民相互了解，相互協力的重要性了。我們近年屢次主張，中日協力政府與政府固然需要，而國民與國民間也同樣需要，尤其是日本政府對於中國國民間的力量應予重視，一切方策，更須適合中國的國情民情，這樣雖在各有希望，各有困難，但是必能互相瞭解了。現在我們相信兩國之間正向這一途徑前進也是可以吿慰於國父的一事。</p>
<p>第三，當日俄之戰，東鄉元帥擊破俄國海軍以後，這消息給予歐洲人的極大悲憂，英國人以爲終非白種人之福，其後不久，國父適自歐洲坐船回到亞洲經過蘇鄉土運河時，有阿拉伯土人求見，紛紛詢問日本打敗帝俄海軍的消息，表示很高興的模樣，因爲阿拉伯土人看見　國父是黃種人，黃種人勝利了，引起一種自然的共鳴，國父從此更感封白種人對於黃種人的歧視，黃種人應該益發的團納，所以益堅大亞洲主義的主張。現在自大束亞戰爭以後，經盟邦的努力，先後驅逐英美勢力，使緬甸菲律賓均成獨立國，印度成立臨時政府，南洋土著民族，均予參政自由的機會，這又是國父所極端希望的事，現在又實現了。我們對於國父的期待，雖能逐漸實現，可是距離最終的目標尚遠，我們在紀念國父誕長之際，尤其不能忘懷更求進取的努力</p>
<p>劉仰山詞</p>
<p>市黨部主任委員劉仰山演講詞，略謂：今日爲　國父誕辰紀念，我人每逢迎茲今日，對中國之命運，都有疾首憂慮之憾，且對國家之前途，殷切期望，數十年來恒焦急失望。過去對於任何會議，更有感失望，因國家之命運，在走上千鈞一髮生死之關頭，但對國家之前途，更期望曙露光明。</p>
<p>諸位均已深知我國之命運，早年受英美之壓迫，架上枷鎖，檢討過去我國沒有內憂外患，絕對不曾遭受此等地步，尤其深受遜淸之害非淺，在辛亥革命成功推翻淸代時，當時對於國家之命運，滿望可以好轉，並可建設近代國家，惜因主持人未能認淸時局，不堅定革命信念遂又染受遜淸之餘毒，造成北洋軍閥之拏張，而外又受帝國主義者之日益緊逼。迨至民國十三年時，　國父憂國逝世，而中國國民黨在其時加以改進，才爲一般民衆對國家有深切之認識，竭力反對帝國主議，終於在民國十六年揚開北伐革命，完成全　統一，而中國之前途當可　轉，建設三民主義國家。詎料尤爲共黨從中挑撥離問，發動陰謀搗亂，在民國十八年十九年時，又發生內戰。至民國二十一年，一般有議人士，日見國家命運之危岌，販需團結，當時國內人士，捐棄一切成見，協助國民政府，期我國即可循上正軌，前途捩轉爲安，豈知又深受英美帝國之妒忌，企圖破壞中國復興，策動共黨死灰復燃，離間中日兩國國交，又嗾使對日作戰，不幸造成七七事變。我國父在二十年前，即提倡大亞洲主義，鼓吹東亞全民族聯合團結，以奠定東亞基礎，當初國父目見東亞各國深受白種人之侵略，冀圖策成各個擊破，以全滅東亞之野心，使東亞人爲白種人之奴隸，因此國父即竭力提倡大亞洲主義，而中日事變即爲彼輩之極大陰謀。直至十二月八日，大東亞戰事在於盟邦日本揭開序幕後，大亞洲主義乃吿實踐，故　國父遺志，指示路綫，絕對不錯，可達到預期目的。</p>
<p>惟中國革命之目的乃求中國之自由平等，及聯合世界上以平等待我我民族，共同奮鬥，因此英美侵略我們，必須予以打倒。現在日本將不平等之廢隊，並交回租界，我們對日本之熱誠，必須緊密聯擊協力國父早經明確指示，舉凡世界人種，有黃白紅黑色種，而紅黑人種又歸白種人所奴化，如今之大東亞戰爭，即爲黃種人要求生存，而抵抗白種人，如一且大東亞戰爭不幸失敗，我們黃種人瀕入同一之命運，膚切相關，非戰爭到底獲得最後勝利不休，故大東亞戰爭乃即生存之戰，因英美人之挑戰，乃爲霸道，勞師動衆，我們之反抗，乃爲王道正義而戰，以逸待勞，在檢討過去國運，及檢討親在，我們確具有把握故最後勝利必能達到，我們尤其在當前不必憂慮，不容消沉，一起努力，共同達到目的。</p>

<p>盟邦海軍大臣之感謝文</p>
<p>本日上海海軍保甲市民，以共同擊滅英美之赤誠，獻納海軍報國號飛機，舉行盛大之命名式，本大臣得與盛典，實非常欣快。在現代戰爭中，飛機能決定戰爭之勝敗，而發揮偉大之戰略，此次台灣海面，及菲島海面，海空戰之戰果，實踐證明之。敵美費多年心力所建造少戰艦及航空母艦等，經我方精銳航空部隊之攻擊，一瞬間即沉於海底，故今後戰局之興廢，均親航空兵力之充實與否爲轉移。現在敵美方面之航空兵力，已受極大打擊，今後自將仗其生產力，以全部精力，努力再建工作，而我帝國亦自飛機以至於艦船兵器之生產，無論質量，均將實現其劃期的向上擴充，而感於此次之戰果，更加努力生產，以擊滅敵人。本年秋，上海海軍保甲區市民，以大東亞之運命爲已任而即燃起同生共死之熟誠，獻納多數優良飛行機，以加强帝國海軍之威力，不勝感激之至。此等飛機，經忠勇海軍航空部隊員之駕駛，出動於太平洋之上，每一飛機，均必獲光榮之戰果，以報答諸君之赤誠，對於獻納諸君，衷心極表感激，並對本日參加諸君，亦表謝意。</p>
<p>湊少將詞</p>
<p>命名式委員長湊少將致詞：一本日盟邦中華民國上海市海軍保甲區市民獻納愛國號飛機，舉行命名式，際此決戰時期，意義極爲深長，本委員長，極爲感謝。自大東亞戰爭開始以來，我方航空部隊，在太平洋及大陸全戰城，獲得赫赫戰果，確立勝利基礎，其致勝之道，固於前綫將士之忠勇，而教方飛機質量之優秀性，亦支配戰局之主因，實爲明顯，至於輸送多數精銳飛機至前綫，實爲當今之急務。今日所獻納之報國號飛機廿二架，實能在大東亞之上空，建立赫赫偉勳，今後，希望中日二國，爲實現同生共死之精神，努力邁進。」</p>
<p>勝野實詞</p>
<p>日本上海海軍特別陸戰隊司令官勝野實訓詞，略謂：「本日爲海軍保甲成立三週紀念及獻機命名典禮本職得躬與其盛，藉述所懷，實深榮幸。此次爲紀念創立三週年，海軍獻納新銳飛機，使帝國之戰力增添一大威力，尤足爲保甲各位眞正理解，中日同盟，完遂大東亞戰爭之大理想，正向其實現之途邁之左證，本職深覺愉快。今擊滅驕敵英美之時機已至，前綫捷報，紛至沓來，惟在未完全擊碎敵八野心以前，絲毫未許樂觀，是以對敵方不逞份子之蠢動，及敵機之來襲，此後更宜嚴加戒備。願保甲民各位在堅强信念之下，益形强化自治自衛之態勢，共向完遂建設大東亞鴻業光榮之途邁進。」</p>
<p>陳市長詞</p>
<p>陳市長致詞今日海軍保甲成立三週年紀念，舉行獻機典禮，本人得參加盛典，曷勝榮幸。海軍保甲諸君過去對工作之努力，本人極爲欽佩，今日獻機於盟邦海軍當局，實可表現中日民衆協力大東亞戰爭之熱忱，且恭逢國父誕辰，更覺意義重大。現大東亞戰爭日趨激烈，本人希望由海軍警備地區之保甲獻機，推及其他地區以至全國。」</p>
<p>宇佐美詞</p>
<p>日本駐華特命全權公使宇佐美珍彥祝詞，略謂：「上海海軍保甲成立以來已經三載，今日復有贈我帝國海軍精銳戰鬥機廿二架之舉，本人對此，莫名感激。此次合灣東方及菲蠢海面，我帝國獲得空前大戰果，諸君在此時期獻贈飛機，於共同戰爭之完成，意義非常重大。去年十一月六日之大東亞共同宣言，目的在打倒亞細亞之侵略者，而在完成此次目的之過程中，中日二國實爲戰力之軸心，同時亦爲建設大東亞共榮圈之中樞。中日二國之關係，最切實的表現於中華國父孫先生之「必須與共存亡安危者」一語中，在中日同盟條約締結二國永久友好關係並基於道義的精神相互提携之今日，本人對海軍保甲諸位之熱忱，衷心表示謝意並致敬意，同時希望，今後爲完成戰爭建設東亞更加努力。」</p>
<p>久保寺詞</p>
<p>久保寺德次辭，略謂：「本日恭逢孫中山先生誕辰，又爲海軍保甲成立三週紀念，兼爲我七十萬保甲赤誠凝成之獻機，舉行命名典禮，承蒙海軍大臣代表，中國方面艦隊司令長官閣下，暨中日各方多數來賓蒞臨，幷懇切賜敎，吾人於深切感激之餘，尤覺無限光榮。溯自中華民國三十年七月十二日，依據中國方面艦隊命令，在海軍警備地區，實施上海從來認爲不可能之保甲制度以來，業經三載有餘，我保甲同人，在日本海軍指導之下，幷得各方協力與援助，克復一切困難，使此優良制度，得以普遍展開於全上海，全華中，全中國。三年以來，我海軍保甲同人，更隨世界情勢之變遷，與夫社會環境之需求將工作範圍予以擴展，除已達成協力治安警備澄淸社會之預期目的外，幷對自警自衛防空以至靑年鍛鍊，物品配給等等俱有相當貢獻，且其活動範圍，日益擴大，視今後指導運營如何，深信前途，定有無限量之發展。本日在此舉行命名典禮之獻機運動，原爲目前區內七十萬居民，自動奮起保衛自己天空之表現，歷時僅一月，而獻機有二十二架之多，余爲保甲之負責者，當念及保甲民諸君此種滿腔熟忱時，於欽佩之餘，不禁淚下。此種成就，一方面固應歸功於保甲同人之指導有方，另一方面實可謂一般保甲民深明中日同盟同生共死之大義，因是，能沆　一氣，而有二國興亡相共之深切認識，此種至情熱意，足以擊滅英美之戰鬥力，實較任何武器爲堅强，此則殊堪興奮與慶幸者也。</p>

<h3 id="c21">汪精衛先生自述 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>我原籍是浙江山陰。祖父以上墳墓。都在山陰。父親始遷至廣東番禺。他雖然聽得懂廣東話。却不會說。仍然是浙江人。初娶盧氏。也是浙江人。生一子三女。我母親姓吳。方　是廣東人。生三女三子。我在兄弟行第四。連姊妹算第十。在生時。父親已六十二歲了。我十三歲。母親病歿。十四歲。父親病歿。依戀父母的光陰。統共只得這些。其間還除去我襁裼中無知無識的時候。算來不過十年。我只記得父親是一個勤學的人。七十一歲以後。眼生蒙醫。不能看見細字。耳又重聽。當我傍晚由書熟放學回家的時候。父親必令我大聲誦讀王陽明傳習錄等書兩三頁。傾耳而聽。又令我在一塊白漆木板上寫三四寸大的字。或陶詩。或陸放翁詩兩三首。背手徐看。直至背誦得出。方纔罷休。每有和作。便令我筆記起來。我父親是九月初七日夜半得霍亂病。初八日午時死的。死前一晚。這功課並沒間斷。在我自己。因此所受的益。比在書熟裏似乎多些。我的母親提起來。眞傷心。我覺她得的一生。只是沈浸在憂勞兩個字裏。家計的艱難。家事的瑣碎。以及在家庭內所受的閒氣。如今還一幕一幕的時時湧現於我眼前。我有一卷秋庭晨課圖。並有一段跋語。將我母親的生平。以及我幼時的光景。約略寫出。我父親在時。家計已經貧薄。父親直到七十歲。還要掙錢養家。至七十一歲方纔歇業。父親歿後。並無遺產。我衣食之費。都仰給於畏兄。至十七歲。便出去做子曰先生。每月得十元修金。兼去各書院應試。往往取得優等。每月平均。得膏火銀二十元左右。十八歲。三兄病歿。十九歲。二兄病歿。和兩寡嫂一孤姪。恃此度日。一言蔽之。我幼時的生活。是貧薄的悲苦的。至於我的學業。因爲只受過子曰先生的敎育。當然所調外國文算術體操等等。都談不到。十六歲以後。論到自己做子日先生了。不但談不到。因爲時間與經濟的關係。連夢也夢不到。所以我的一生。缺乏普通學識。甚至運身體也呆笨不靈。這是提起來便慚愧的。幸而我幼時除了受子日先生的敎育以外。還受些家庭敎育。我叔父更是博學。藏書數萬卷。因此我於經史子集四部之書。也還窺見一些。但這算得什麼呢。</p>
<p>及至二十歲。居然得著機會。考取留學日本法政速成科的官費生。到了東京速成科。畢業後。自費入專門科。自費的錢。是從譯書來的。只是那時的譯書只爲得錢。如法規大全等等。純是雇傭式的工作。官費的時候。每月祗得三十元。自費的時候。每月所入。竟有五六十元。除了自己使用之外。還可以帮帮朋友的忙。</p>
<p>我在國內。研究史學的時候。對於遼金元之侵吞中國。免不了填胸憤慨。對於淸。自然是一樣的。只是被什麼君臣之義東縛住了。及至留學法政。從　法學得到了國家懸念。及主權在民觀念。從前所謂君臣之義。撇至九霄雲外。固有的民族思想。勃然而興。與新得的民權思想。會合起來。便決定了革命的趨向。乙已年我二十二歲。孫先生到東京。我和朱執信等幾個人前去見面加入中國同盟會。是爲我獻身革命之始。那時候。兩廣總督是岑春煊。我的長兄在他募府。和一位劉子蕃先生同事。他兩人原是朋友。我的長兄曾替我訂婚於他的一位令妹。這種辦法。如今是不行的。但在　時。郤以爲天理人情之至。身爲長兄。老子死了不替兄弟定個把老婆。是要惹人議論的。所以就這樣的幹起來。不但不必微我同意。連通知也不必的。如此者。幾年了。忽然聽得我做了革命黨。不免驚心。民報上文章。越做得多。風聲自然越緊。有一日。岑春煊喝醉了酒。硬要我長兄將我交出來。不然就要對不住我長兄。急得沒法。我得此信息。便寫了一封最後的家信。署名家庭之罪人。這封信我如今還記得。寫在下面。事已發覺。謹自絕於家庭。以免相累。家中子弟多矣。何靳此一人。望縱之俾爲國流血。以竟其志。死且不朽。惟寡嫂孤姪。望善撫之。不然。死不瞑目。抑此非罪人之所宣言也。與劉氏女曾有婚的。但罪人旣與家庭斷絕。則此關係亦當隨以斷絕。請自今日始。解除婚約。長兄得此信後。便將驅逐逆弟永離家門。具眾番禺縣存案。復和劉十蕃先生商量。將兩家聘物交還。婚約焚燒。作爲了事。後來聞得劉氏女反對他們這種做法。直至民國元年。我已娶了。回到廣州。重見家門。聞得她尚未嫁。我覺得正如古人所言。我雖不殺伯仁。伯仁由我而死。未免耿耿於心。及至聞得她和一位陳先生結婚了。方緣寗帖。我從二十二歲加入同盟會。今年已五十一歲了。在這三十年中。所經過的。我不願多說。因爲就民國以前來說。從乙已年起。我的主張和議論。都載在民報。丁未以後。奉孫先生命奔走南洋。組織同盟會分會百餘處。在那時候。所有演講和論說。都載在中興日報。已酉以後。潛入北京。被人捉住。放在牢裏。也還有一首述懷詩。載在小休集。獄中生活，也被南社詩話采錄。這些都可算做我的自傳。記得庚戌三月初七日。我在北京被警察捉住。在夾衣裏搜出革命之趨勢。革命之決心。及吿別同志時。地間我爲什麼將這些文章藏在身上。我答沒有別的。不過覺得拿墨來寫。是不够的。想拿血來寫。所以放在身上。豫備死的時候。有些血沾在上面。所以我覺得拿生平的演講和論說。當做自傳。是最眞實的。不必另外再作自傳了。就民國以後來說。也是如此。不過民國以後的事情。比民國以前複雜得多。我的革命決心。固然始終沒有改變。而我對人對事的態度。郤不免時有改變。但所以改變的理由。我無不議出來。至於理由的對不對。則我願接受現在和後人的評論。（錄自拜袁堂　書）</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The National Government issued a statement: Chairman Wang went abroad in March of this year for medical treatment at Nagoya Hospital in Japan. His condition improved and worsened intermittently. Unfortunately, he passed away at 4:20 PM on November 10th of this year. All members of the National Government and our nation's soldiers and civilians are deeply saddened by this news. Throughout his life, the Chairman assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen and later succeeded Dr. Sun in leading the people, dedicating himself to the revolution with the aim of achieving freedom and equality for China and independence and liberation for Asia. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, he has strived to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, promote peaceful unification, increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, strengthen national defense, pacify local areas, train youth, and cooperate in completing the war, and he has been diligent and hardworking. He ultimately laid the foundation for domestic reconstruction and established alliances of equality and mutual assistance externally. Unfortunately, he passed away prematurely, carrying his ambitions with him to the grave. The National Government vows to lead the nation's soldiers and civilians in inheriting his legacy, overcoming difficulties, and continuing to work hard. We will implement the National Government's platform and basic policies personally drafted by the Chairman, uphold the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and work together with allied and friendly nations to complete the war, striving for China's freedom and equality and Asia's independence and liberation.</p>
<p>Over the years, our ally Japan has provided full assistance to our country's independence and autonomy and to the progress of the National Government. The National Government is saddened by this great loss, but our original intention to save China and protect East Asia will not waver. We are willing to work together and move forward towards a bright future. This is a special statement.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Respectful Reception of the Coffin</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the news of the passing of the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang spread, the whole country mourned, and the entire world grieved. The Chairman's coffin was respectfully brought back to the capital from Japan at 5:30 PM on the 12th. Central Committee members and senior civil and military officials from various ministries and departments of the National Government, as well as military and political leaders from allied nations in China, diplomatic envoys from Germany, Italy, Manchukuo and other friendly nations, and more than a thousand of the Chairman's relatives, personally attended the airport to respectfully receive the coffin. At 5:20 PM, the special "Haiyan" plane flew over the capital, circled once, and then landed at 5:30 PM amidst the sound of national music. Senior civil and military officials from the army and navy formed two rows. Acting Chairman Chen then led Chu Minyi, Xu Sujia, Lin Baisheng, Chen Junxi, Li Ouyi, Chen Changzu, Chen Quan, He Bingxian, and other civil and military officials who were to carry the coffin, approached the plane, and bowed three times in the highest respect. Everyone entered the plane to pay their respects to the deceased. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, the officials carrying the coffin respectfully carried the coffin off the plane. At the same time, mournful music was played, and all those who were receiving the coffin stood solemnly at attention, expressing their deep grief. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. Accompanying the Chairman's coffin were Madam Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, as well as sons, daughters, and Administrative Yuan Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, and others. The coffin was draped in the national flag. After being respectfully carried off the plane amidst mournful music, it was immediately transferred to a hearse. The hearse was draped in white silk and flanked by national flags. It then departed in an atmosphere of extreme grief. The procession was led by a pilot car, followed by the Chairman's hearse. Acting Chairman Chen respectfully followed behind the hearse, followed by ceremonial guards, the vehicles of those who carried the coffin, and finally more than three hundred vehicles carrying Central Committee members, heads of various ministries and departments, and other officials from allied and friendly nations. The procession stretched for several miles. Along the way, civil servants, soldiers, police officers, students, and civilians wore black armbands and held national flags, lining up to respectfully receive the coffin. They bowed in respect as the hearse passed. The hearse entered the city through Guanghua Gate, passed Zhongshan East Road, Xinjiekou, Zhongshan North Road, Gulou, and Baotai Street, and arrived at the National Government building after more than an hour, around 7:00 PM. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, the coffin was carried out of the hearse by the same officials and into the National Government Auditorium. Inside the hall, a respectful reception ceremony was held. Everyone stood in solemn silence. National music was then played. Acting Chairman Chen, as the officiating officer, took his place and respectfully presented a wreath. Everyone bowed three times to the coffin in the highest respect and observed three minutes of silence in mourning. In an atmosphere of extreme grief, the ceremony was declared complete. Civil and military officials then withdrew in an orderly fashion. The envoys from Japan, Manchukuo, Germany, and Italy also paid their respects. It should be noted that yesterday was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. The people of the capital not only remembered Dr. Sun's arduous efforts in promoting the revolution and establishing the Republic, but also received the news of the passing of Chairman Wang, the only successor to Dr. Sun's legacy. This increased their grief and mourning even more. Therefore, all citizens lined up to respectfully receive the coffin. From Guanghua Gate to the National Government building, people stood shoulder to shoulder, blocking the road. The tension and solemnity of the atmosphere were unprecedented. This is because the Chinese people deeply know that Chairman Wang was a faithful follower of the Chinese National Revolution. In his early years, he followed Dr. Sun and traveled for the country. After Dr. Sun's death, he inherited his legacy and led his comrades to carry out the revolutionary cause. When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, he saw the difficulties of the time and resolutely issued the "Yan Telegram", advocating for peace. In May of the 29th year [of the Republic], he led the establishment of the government and the return to the capital, seeking peace and unification internally and fostering good neighborly relations externally. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he led the masses with a determination to live and die together, participating in the war with unity and cooperation, and seeking the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia, so as to realize Dr. Sun's legacy of Pan-Asianism. Therefore, the Chairman's death is not only a loss of a wise leader for our four hundred million Chinese compatriots, but also a great loss for the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia and even the prosperity of the world.</p>
<p>Chairman's Body Transported Back to the Motherland</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Nagoya: Since this morning, the 12th, the special room of the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital has been crowded with Japanese civil and military officials who came to see off Chairman Wang's coffin for its return to the country. At 7:20 AM, Ambassador Cai Pei first appeared in the room where the coffin was placed. At the same time, at 7:40 AM, Lieutenant Qi Rong of the aide-de-camp held a chrysanthemum necklace and led the way out of the room, followed by the Chairman's family and son-in-law He Wenjie. Lieutenant Qi Rong of the aide-de-camp and Li Fu, director of the Nanjing Central Hospital, and others rode in cars and quietly drove out of the hospital gate. At 8:07 AM, the lead car proceeded, and all general traffic was cut off at the time. This was followed by the Chairman's hearse, and behind it were Secretary-General Zhou's wife, Madam Liang Ruzhuo, Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, aides-de-camp, and Ambassador Cai Pei. What was visible to everyone was the Chairman's coffin covered with the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun. Madam Wang and other aides-de-camp attended, and the hearse moved to the hearse at precisely 8:00 a.m. Yasusho, Saito, Kakura, Takagi, Rikikawa, and the hospital personnel bowed their heads to send off. The Chairman's hearse was followed by Madam Wang, Wang Fangdi, Wang Wenxing, Wang Wenbin, and the vehicle of the officials following, then by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, former East Asia Minister Aoki, former Prime Minister Konoe, General Tojo, Vice Minister of the Army Yuzuki, and various other local civil and military officials, as well as medical personnel in the vehicles following. At 8:50 AM, the hearse arrived at the airfield, at which time all those seeing him off stood in formation and paid their respects to the hearse. The coffin was then placed by representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy, embassy staff, comrades, Madam Wang, the filial sons Wang Wenxing and Wang Wenbin, and others in the "Haiyan" aircraft, the Chairman's favorite plane during his lifetime, under the solemn gaze of important figures from China and Japan. Before long, the engines of the Haiyan roared to life. As the Chairman's coffin was about to bid farewell to Japanese soil, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso resolutely gave a salute. Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu waved his top hat high, standing next to Finance Minister Ishiwatari. Former Prime Minister Konoe quietly lowered his head. General Tojo, with an expression of immeasurable generosity, gave an unmoving salute. Ambassador Cai and other members of the embassy gave the highest respect of more than 90 degrees. This East Asian giant has bid his final farewell and returned to the mountains and rivers of his homeland. Following the Haiyan aircraft, there were two escort aircraft that made a large circuit in the air and then flew to Fukuoka, Shanghai, and the capital, Nanjing, at 9:12 AM on the 12th.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment Overseas</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Propaganda Department issued a public announcement as follows: At 6:00 PM on November 12th, Chairman Wang of the National Government passed away in the afternoon hour on November 10th, 33rd year of the Republic, at the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital in Japan. He was born in the afternoon hour on May 4th, 29 years before the founding of the Republic, and lived for 62 years. The body was respectfully brought back to the country on November 12th to be prepared for encoffining. The national funeral will be held on a selected date, and the closing ceremony will be reverently handled by the Funeral Committee organized by the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang was shot and injured by an assailant while attending the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee during his tenure as the President of the Executive Yuan in the 24th year of the Republic. He underwent medical treatment both domestically and abroad. Although his health recovered, the bullet left in his back was never removed due to his constant travels for national affairs. Since the start of the peace movement, he had been overly concerned and diligent, and often felt pain. Towards the end of August last year, he began to experience pain in his back, chest, and both sides. Afterwards, the pain gradually worsened, and he underwent surgery in Nanjing on December 19th to remove the bullet. The procedure went well at the time, and the wound was just recovering. However, he was unable to fully recuperate and had to handle numerous national affairs every day. In mid-January of this year, he relapsed with chills and fever, and the wound pain recurred, making it difficult to move. However, he still handled important matters while lying in bed and often summoned cadres and comrades to give instructions in person, working as hard as usual. His body became increasingly difficult to support, and he finally heeded medical advice to seek medical treatment in another location. On March 3rd, he went to Japan and entered the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital, where several of the highest authorities in the medical field were specially assigned to diagnose and treat him, using all possible modern medical methods. During this time, his condition improved and worsened intermittently. For about ten days from the end of September to the beginning of October, and for four days from October 20th, his temperature exceeded 37.5 degrees Celsius, with a slight fever. Otherwise, he remained stable with a good appetite. He maintained a daily intake of 1,500 calories, which was generally similar to before. However, special attention had to be paid to prevent pneumonia, acute heart failure, and other complications. Until 6:00 AM on the 10th of this month, his condition changed dramatically. His temperature rose to 40.6 degrees Celsius, his pulse increased to 128 beats per minute, his appetite was completely gone, and he had difficulty breathing, gradually entering a critical condition. After undergoing X-ray treatment of the spine and pelvic region seven times, the pain in his back and waist was relieved, and his appetite gradually increased. However, due to prolonged bed rest, his body became increasingly weak, and his pulse reached 90 to 110 beats per minute. His sleep was also affected by the pain in his back and waist and the cough. Since the beginning of September, he had been coughing up phlegm and feeling difficulty. Although he was injected with cardiotonics and inhaled oxygen, based on such a condition, he passed away at 4:20 PM on the same day. During his illness, he constantly worried that he would not be able to rise again. He always thought of achieving peace and unification and relieving the suffering of the people, and encouraged all members of the Kuomintang, all comrades of the peace movement, and all national citizens and youth to follow Dr. Sun's teachings internally and implement the Three Principles of the People, and to abide by the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration externally, striving to obtain China's independence and freedom, and seeking the liberation of East Asia, and to cooperate with Greater East Asia to guarantee China's independence and freedom.</p>
<p>Chairman was born seventeen years after Dr. Sun and died nineteen years after Dr. Sun. He followed Dr. Sun and dedicated himself to the revolution for forty years. For the first twenty years, he assisted Dr. Sun, and for the next twenty years, he was Dr. Sun's successor. China's independence and Asia's liberation were Dr. Sun's unfinished ambitions, which Chairman Wang took up and completed. Just as the dawn of the century-old plan for East Asia was breaking, he abandoned his comrades and the people and passed away. All of us who are left behind should uphold his legacy to console Chairman's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Japanese Emperor Presents Chrysanthemum Collar Decoration</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Nagoya, after the news of the passing of Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government of the Republic of China was released, His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, upon hearing the news, was deeply grieved. When His Majesty the Emperor learned that Chairman Wang's condition was critical, he presented Chairman Wang with the highest honor, the Chrysanthemum Collar Decoration, with the highest courtesy for the head of an allied nation.

Then, Ambassador Cai Pei held the gifts given by His Majesty the Emperor and respectfully placed them before the late Chairman Wang's coffin.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After learning of the passing of our country's Chairman Wang, everyone in Japan was deeply saddened. They all believe that the Chairman was not only the head of China but also a pioneer of East Asia. Since leading the peace movement, he has spared no effort for the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. At last year's Greater East Asia Conference, the Chairman's inspiring speech is still deeply imprinted in the minds of the Japanese people. During the Chairman's treatment in Japan, all parties paid special attention to the Chairman's condition and often silently prayed for the Chairman to recover soon. Now, upon suddenly hearing the sad news, some were so grieved that they wept, and unanimously expressed their deep sympathy for our country's loss of a great leader. They also firmly believe that our country will become even more united, continue the Chairman's legacy, and strive to fight. At the same time, they expressed that they will further cooperate with our country in the future, advance together, and seek the completion of the war and the liberation of East Asia.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mourning Chairman Wang <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government unfortunately passed away on the 10th of this month. When the sad news arrived, the whole country was shocked and mourned. At this time of decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, when the country's steps are difficult, the sudden loss of a leader is truly the greatest loss for our country.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's lifelong words and deeds are too numerous to mention. Many special collections have already recorded them, which can be used for later generations to admire and learn from. The Chairman's loyalty to the country, his painstaking efforts, his diligence in governing, his courage to pursue justice, and his perseverance in difficult times are all enough to be taken as a model by those who serve the country in the future. In the past five years, he launched the peace movement with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell," and without fear of danger, he was born into the world, never changing his mind in the face of adversity, and laying the foundation for the cause of peace. This spirit is especially worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Today, as we mourn the passing of Chairman Wang, at the same time, we should recognize the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Chairman Wang was the successor of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, not only promoting and carrying forward Dr. Sun's doctrines and theories, but also striving to realize Dr. Sun's legacy. Among Dr. Sun's legacies, the Pan-Asianism that concerns the fate of the entire China and even the entire Asia must be completed through cooperation between China and Japan. Dr. Sun once affirmed: "Without China, there is no Japan; without Japan, there is no China." Therefore, Chairman Wang was committed to Sino-Japanese cooperation and the realization of Pan-Asianism. Since the launch of the peace movement and China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, he has further concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance and jointly issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. At this point, Dr. Sun's Pan-Asianism has gradually taken concrete shape and is being gradually realized. This is the most important thing that Chairman Wang has inherited from Dr. Sun's legacy.</p>
<p>(2) At the end of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Chairman Wang issued the "Yan Telegram" suggesting peace, in which he said: "The purpose of China's resistance is to seek national survival and independence. After more than a year of resistance, the wounds are deep and painful. If the war can still be ended with a peace that is in accordance with justice, then the nation's survival and independence can be guaranteed, and the purpose of resistance will have been achieved...China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and good neighborliness and friendship are natural and necessary. Over the years, the reasons for the opposite direction must be deeply sought and each must) understand their responsibilities. In the future, China should adopt good neighborliness and friendship as its educational policy, and Japan should especially order its people to abandon their traditional ideas of aggression and humiliation towards China, and establish a pro-China policy in education, in order to lay the foundation for permanent peace between the two countries. This is the effort that we should make for the happiness of East Asia. At the same time, we must also work with all related countries to maintain and enhance their friendship and common interests for the sake of the tranquility and order of the Pacific and the peace and security of the world." Since then, the peace movement has adjusted relations between the two countries based on this. For more than five years, facts have proven the correctness of the peace policy, which has gradually evolved to promote the realization of Pan-Asianism. Now, although Chairman Wang has passed away, there is no doubt that Chairman Wang's legacy should continue to be practiced. Since Chairman Wang went abroad for medical treatment for more than half a year, the leaders of the National Government have been able to maintain the central government's politics. In the future, they should not only continue his legacy and strive for its realization, but also reform the officialdom and innovate politics, so that the Chairman's legacy can be further promoted. At the same time, Japan's policy towards China declares that it will remain unchanged. Therefore, the peace policy, the Sino-Japanese Alliance, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration will only be further promoted in the future and will never be changed.</p>
<p>When Chairman Wang initiated the peace movement, perhaps most people could not understand it. However, now the United Kingdom and the United States have not abandoned their ambition of aggression and are trying to turn the Chinese mainland into a battlefield. On the other hand, China and Japan have concluded an alliance and are working towards a common goal. From this, it can be seen that the peace movement is indeed natural and necessary. Although the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War has been laid, there are still many difficulties ahead, which still require the joint cooperation of China and Japan to strive for the realization of the Chairman's legacy, so as to comfort Chairman's spirit in heaven.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Government Issues Statement: Strengthening Ties Between the Two Countries, Advancing Towards the Realization of Common Ideals <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After receiving the news of the death of Chairman Wang of the National Government, the Japanese Imperial Government issued a statement at 6:00 p.m. on the 12th, expressing sincere condolences for the great achievements of the Chairman during his lifetime. At the same time, it stated that the death of the Chairman would not change the relationship between China and Japan in any way. It would uphold the Chairman's will, strengthen the alliance, complete the Greater East Asia War, and realize common ideals, demonstrating an unwavering determination. The Imperial Government's statement said that Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government of the Republic of China came to Japan in March of this year for medical treatment. He had been concentrating on treatment in Nagoya, but unfortunately his condition suddenly deteriorated and he passed away. Chairman Wang had long cherished the great ambition of revitalizing China and building East Asia. Inheriting the National Father's testament, he devoted himself to peaceful nation-building and the revival of East Asia until today. His brilliant achievements will forever add glory to history. However, just as the revival of East Asia was halfway completed, heaven did not bless him, and a great star has fallen. The establishment of good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Japan is based on the revival and defense of East Asia. At this time, when the two nations of China and Japan are more aware of their heavy responsibilities and are striving for even closer unity, China should strive to fulfill Chairman Wang's unfinished ambitions and cooperate even more closely for the future of East Asia. The Japanese government is determined to adhere to its established policy, further strengthen the alliance between China and Japan, and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, so as to strive towards the realization of common ideals. This statement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koiso Issues Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso issued a statement on the occasion of Chairman Wang's death, saying: "Chairman Wang of the National Government of the Republic of China came to Japan for medical treatment and passed away in Nagoya on November 10th. I deeply mourn his passing. Chairman Wang received the teachings of the National Father Sun Yat-sen from a young age and was a young revolutionary. He has repeatedly faced dangers and risked his life for the liberation and revival of China, which is well known to the world. In 1937, the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident broke out. The Japanese Imperial Government, in view of the century-long plan for China and Japan, was determined to resolve the situation on the spot, but the Chongqing side did not understand our intentions, and the incident expanded. However, Chairman Wang, with a view to the overall situation, responded to the Konoe Statement at the end of 1938, decisively broke away from Chongqing, and resolved to act jointly with the Japanese government for the liberation of East Asia. Chairman Wang eliminated all obstacles for the cooperation between the two countries and finally realized the return of the National Government to Nanjing. Externally, he forged friendly relations with the Empire, and internally, he abolished extraterritorial rights, recovered concessions, and consolidated the cornerstone of the new China's construction. He can truly be called a hero. During the Greater East Asia Conference, the Chairman's demeanor and passionate roar are still firmly remembered in our minds. Now, his sudden passing is deeply mourned and is a great loss to China. However, I believe that his great aspirations and legacy will surely be reflected in his old friends. Here, I offer my sincere praise for Chairman Wang's great aspirations and legacy. At the same time, I hope that the 400 million Chinese people will share Chairman Wang's will and strive for the future and prosperity of China and the development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, Speaks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the sad news of the death of Chairman Wang, our highest leader, spread, the whole world mourned. The Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, specially issued the following condolence speech: "Upon receiving the sad news of Chairman Wang's death and today's welcoming of the remains in Nanjing, I am deeply saddened. I recall that my visit to Chairman Wang at the Nagoya Imperial Hospital on May 27th was our last meeting.</p>
<p>At that time, the Chairman said that in this critical situation, all comrades were working hard, but he (the Chairman referred to himself), due to illness, was unable to manage affairs, which he deeply regretted. The Chairman's words that night are still vivid in my mind. Although the Chairman was on his sickbed, he never forgot about state affairs, but he was deeply troubled by his inability to move freely.</p>
<p>The Chairman did not live to see the realization of the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, and passed away suddenly, which he must have regretted.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Zhongming, a comrade of the Chairman, was assassinated in Hanoi, and on his deathbed, he said that state affairs were in the hands of the Chairman. Now, the Chairman, who is responsible for these state affairs, has also passed away suddenly, which is a source of infinite grief. However, I remember that the National Father Sun Yat-sen also held the great ambition of uniting Asia, and although he died halfway, his spirit illuminates the bright future of China, which is known to everyone.</p>
<p>Since Chairman Wang led the peace movement, he has left great achievements in the construction of the new China. He successfully abolished unequal treaties in accordance with the National Father's will, laid the foundation for China's complete independence, and these achievements will be immortalized in history.</p>
<p>On October 30th last year, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed, I congratulated the Chairman. On the National Father's Birthday Commemoration Day last year, at the National Father's Mausoleum, a ceremony was held to report the realization of the National Father's will. When the Chairman solemnly reported the abolition of unequal treaties, I believed that the spirit of the National Father in heaven must have been overjoyed.</p>
<p>The Chairman's ideal was to complete China's independent autonomy, establish a permanent friendly relationship between China and Japan, and cooperate with each other to strive for the liberation and construction of Greater East Asia. His advocacy has been consistent since he broke away from Chongqing. The loftiness of his ideals and the correctness of his advocacy have been best demonstrated in the subsequent development of the Greater East Asia situation. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he clarified the policy of sharing weal and woe, and on January 9th last year, he resolutely rose up and declared war on Britain and the United States. The wise decision born of this ideal was the path for China's progress, which was often clearly instructed by the Chairman. The issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration on November 6th last year can also be said to be the result of the Chairman's efforts and the result of his lifelong advocacy. It is no coincidence that the Empire adopted an attitude of absolute support for the Chairman, because the ideals held by the Chairman and the goals pursued by the Empire are completely consistent. Now that the Chairman has passed away, I hope that the colleagues of the National Government can uphold the Chairman's will and make greater efforts to complete his great cause in the future. The Empire will continue to cooperate with you comrades to achieve the great cause you want to accomplish, so as to comfort his spirit in heaven. Although the Chairman is dead, the Chairman's spirit is immortal, and the Chairman's spirit will become more brilliant. I firmly believe that not only the entire Chinese nation and the nations of Greater East Asia will be inspired by his spirit, and will rise up even more to make their greatest efforts for the liberation of Greater East Asia. I heard that the Chairman often remembered the development of the situation and the situation in China before his death. Now, in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines, our side is constantly pressing the enemy. The colleagues of the National Government will also be able to uphold the Chairman's will, strengthen their efforts, and complete their trusted determination. The entire Chinese nation will also be able to recognize the situation, move towards a bright future together, and comfort the Chairman's spirit. Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Military Situation in the Pacific Over the Past Week <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Greater East Asia Weekly War Situation: (1) In the Philippines, enemy American fleets and aircraft carrier groups have been constantly attacked by Japanese aircraft, suffering heavy losses. Currently, they are replenishing large aircraft such as B-24s from bases along the coast of New Guinea and are working hard to strengthen air strikes against Japanese bases in the central and southern Philippines, such as Cebu and Bacolod. On November 5th and 6th, the surviving reorganized mobile units approached the eastern sea of Luzon, and 500 to 600 carrier-based aircraft also raided Japanese bases in northern Philippines. The enemy's mobile unit combat tactics have been greatly changed due to the lessons learned from the fierce attacks by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and kamikaze teams since mid-October. They are extremely cautious in defense. As for the battle on Leyte Island, the enemy's airfield is repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft and cannot be used arbitrarily. The enemy's rear supply base has also been destroyed, and major bases such as Morotai, northwestern New Guinea, and Admirality have suffered heavy damage. According to enemy American news, the Japanese army on the Philippine front is being continuously strengthened. Currently, the Japanese air force is making every effort to bomb the enemy American transport fleet in the sea. The trend of the Philippine war will shift with the consumption of large amounts of supplies. (2) In the Central Pacific, the enemy army at the southern end of the Palau Islands is trying to advance. Currently, they occupy the mountainous area and blindly attack Japanese positions. They were counterattacked by the Japanese army and forced to retreat. The Japanese army, navy, and air force in the area launched a fierce attack on the enemy American B-29 aircraft base in the Mariana Islands on the morning of the 3rd. On the 7th, they launched two surprise attacks and dropped many huge bombs, causing enemy aircraft and facilities parked on the ground to catch fire and burn down, causing heavy losses to the enemy.</p>

Mr. Wang followed Lord Shengzhai to work as a staff member in the Lufeng County government office. He often practiced calligraphy in the courtyard. His mother, Madam Wu, would always watch him, making it a daily routine. In the evening, after returning from school, Lord Shengzhai would teach him books such as Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" and sometimes ask him to silently recite the poems of Tao Yuanming and Lu Fangweng. He said that the foundation of his lifelong classical learning mostly benefited from family education. He also learned calligraphy from his fifth sister's husband, Yuan Yinbai. Yinbai taught him to suspend his wrist and try writing large characters. He initially studied Dong Xiangguang's style, and then referred to Yan Zhenqing's style.</p>
<p>The 20th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Renyi year (1892 AD, the eighteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was ten years old. In the autumn, Mr. Wang followed Lord Shengzhai back to the provincial capital of Guangdong. After returning from school, Lord Shengzhai taught him literature and history. In this year, Sun Yat-sen graduated from the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, ranking first and obtaining a doctorate. He set up a pharmacy in Macau.</p>
<p>The 19th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Guiyi year (1893 AD, the nineteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was eleven years old. Mr. Wang was still in the provincial capital of Guangdong, studying with Hu Jiaoru (Jiaju). In this year, Sun Yat-sen and Lu Haodong went to Tianjin from Shanghai and submitted a letter to Li Hongzhang, severely criticizing the strategies for saving the country, with over 5,000 words, hitting the current malpractices. At the end of the letter, he said that agriculture is the foundation of the country and should be developed. He wished to go to France to investigate sericulture and agriculture in various countries.</p>
<p>The 18th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Jiamu year (1894 AD, the twentieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twelve years old. Mr. Wang was still living in the provincial capital of Guangdong, studying with Hu Haoru. In this year, Sun Yat-sen went to Honolulu and founded the Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society) with He Kuan, Li Chang, and others. They elected Sun Yat-sen as the president. In July, the Qing court officially declared war on Japan.</p>
<p>The 17th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Yiyi year (1895 AD, the twenty-first year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was thirteen years old. Mr. Wang went to school in the morning to study for the imperial examinations. After school, he would return home and take one or two books from Lord Shengzhai's collection, ascend to the roof tiles and sit down, reading in the light of the setting sun until dusk. Mr. Wang often said that the books he read at that time were far more interesting than the books for the imperial examinations. Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" was his favorite. His mother, Madam Wu, passed away in the Guangdong provincial capital, in the Hao Shen Street residence, at the age of forty-four. On the 27th day of the first month, the Xingzhonghui cadres were officially established in Danton Street, Hong Kong, named Qianheng. In February, at a cadre meeting, they discussed military planning and the national flag with a blue sky and white sun. The design of the national flag was personally made by Lu Haodong. In September, the Guangzhou revolutionary organization was detected by the Qing court, and many people were arrested. Lu Haodong and others were executed. In October, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan and established the Xingzhonghui in Yokohama.</p>
<p>The 16th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Bingshen year (1896 AD, the twenty-second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was fourteen years old. On the eighth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, Lord Shengzhai passed away in the Hao Xian Street residence in the provincial capital, at the age of seventy-four. On October 11th, Sun Yat-sen was captured at the Qing embassy in London.</p>
<p>The 15th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Dingyou year (1897 AD, the twenty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was fifteen years old. Mr. Wang lived with his eldest brother, Jingwu, given name Zhaoquan, in Lechang County, northern Guangdong. Mr. Wang had a poem about Xishi Cliff: "Laughing, I answer clear chants with distant echoes, leaves are on my leaning turban, wine is in my lap. The sky is light with clouds and the sun is bright, the forest is empty and solemn, even deeper. Touching the dogwood roots, I feel a sense of missing my relatives, inscriptions linger, evoking archaeological interest. The famous mountain is within reach, a dream for people, I happen to encounter a good festival and climb up." Mr. Wang began to write poetry from this time on. In this year, Sun Yat-sen lived in London and wrote "Kidnapped in London." He also wrote his autobiography. The Qing court signed a treaty with France, giving it priority in mining in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>The 14th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Wuxu year (1898 AD, the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was sixteen years old. Mr. Wang still lived with his brother Jingwu in the Lechang County government office, devoting himself to literature and history. In the first month, Sun Yat-sen collected the politics, economy, human feelings and customs of various countries in London, learned from their strengths and made up for his weaknesses, and finalized the Three Principles of the People. In February, he went to Yokohama. In March, Miyazaki Torazo of the Japanese People's Party came to visit on the order of Inukai Tsuyoshi, the leader of the Progressive Party. Soon, he welcomed Sun Yat-sen to live in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 13th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Jihai year (1899 AD, the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was seventeen years old. Mr. Wang studied with Zhang Meixuan (Cong) of Panyu in Lechang, devoting himself to the study of literature, history, and statecraft. Zhang had studied with Chen Lantuan (Feng). Mr. Wang's third brother, Shuhe, given name Zhaojun, was his uncle. Mr. Wang wrote essays for the imperial examinations. At that time, Yun Fenghuan, the instructor of Lechang County, from Wenchang County, saw Mr. Wang's articles and said that his writing style was magnificent and unrestrained, predicting that he would be a great person who could turn the world around, praising him endlessly. In this year, Shuhe passed away at the age of twenty-two. Sun Yat-sen's effort to assist the independence of the Philippines failed, and Inukai Tsuyoshi, Hirayama Shu, and Nakamura Yaroku also participated in the matter. He also ordered Chen Shaobai to establish the China Daily in Hong Kong, which was the beginning of the Min Party's newspaper publishing.</p>
<p>The 12th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Gengzi year (1900 AD, the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was eighteen years old. Mr. Wang still lived in the Lechang County government office. At that time, there was the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing, and the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. Mr. Wang, with a sorrowful heart for the times, was determined to purify the world. Sun Yat-sen opened the Xingzhonghui Congress in Hong Kong, serving as the president. He assisted the independence of the Philippines again, but failed. In May, he planned the independence of Guangdong in Hong Kong. On September 6th, Shi Jianru planned to bomb the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, destroying the governor's office. Shi was arrested and died.</p>
<p>The 11th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Xinchou year (1901 AD, the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was nineteen years old. Mr. Wang returned to the Guangdong provincial capital from Lechang County, living with his second brother, Zhongqi, given name Zhaoxuan. They both took the Panyu County examination. The county magistrate, Qian Puru (Suhao) of Taicang, reviewed his article and placed it first, with Zhongqi third. When he opened the examination papers, he knew they were brothers. At the end of the examination, they were switched with Zhongqi. The county had the Yushan Academy, which examined scholars with essays every month. Magistrate Qian obtained Mr. Wang's paper and always praised it greatly. He summoned him many times. At the prefectural examination, Gong Xianzhou (Xinzhan), the prefect of Guangzhou, placed Mr. Wang in the first place. (Jiangcai's note: When I compiled Mr. Wang's chronological biography, I asked Mr. Xie about the prefectural examination in Xinchou year. Mr. Xie's reply stated that regarding the matter of the Jingwei Mr.'s elder brother winning the Guangzhou prefectural examination in the 27th year of Guangxu, at that time, Jingwei Mr. and his brother named Zhao Xuan took the examination together. The examiner, admiring the writing, placed Jingwei Mr.'s brother first. The younger brother's writing was indeed superior to his difficult brother, and it was said that he should not be ranked second. The staff member said that the younger brother should not be ranked ahead of the elder brother. The younger brother said: "Using a jade ruler to measure talent only considers the writing, regardless of age. If you blindly follow the order, you would lose the original intention of measuring writing to seek talent." Therefore, Jingwei Mr. was made the champion, and his brother was placed second. This is the truth of that day.) Soon, he was appreciated by the educational commissioner, Zhu Zumo of Guian. Li Zhun, the admiral of the Guangdong navy, heard of Mr. Wang's name and hired him as a private tutor, teaching his sons to read. In this year, Zhongqi passed away at the age of twenty-four. Two widowed sisters-in-law and one orphaned nephew relied on Mr. Wang's income to live. Mr. Wang felt that the national situation was becoming increasingly dangerous and urgently wanted to save it. Therefore, he and Gu Yingfen, She Zhi, Zhu Dafu, Li Wenfan, Hu Yisheng, and his nephew Zu Zedao, organized the Zhiji Yixue Society at the Xian Street Xilan Academy in Guangzhou, studying practical learning and encouraging each other.</p>
<p>The 10th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Renyin year (1902 AD, the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty years old. Mr. Wang still lived in the provincial capital, teaching students and also taking the academy examinations. In the third month, Zhang Binglin held a China National Humiliation Memorial Meeting in Tokyo, which was obstructed by Cai Jun, the Qing government's ambassador. Sun Yat-sen was in Yokohama and led dozens of overseas Chinese to the scene. Seeing the situation, he knew it was impossible, so he returned to Yokohama and held the memorial ceremony. In this year, the Empress Dowager Cixi issued an edict for the Hundred Days' Reform.</p>
<p>The 9th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Guimao year (1903 AD, the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-one years old. Mr. Wang passed the examination to become a government-funded student in the Law and Politics Accelerated Course in Japan. At that time, the Governor-General of Liangguang was Cen Chunxuan, and the Director of Academic Affairs was Zhang Mingqi. Mr. Wang entered Nihon University to study law and politics. The president of the university, Ume Kenjiro, saw Mr. Wang's paper and was surprised. Therefore, he specially granted him an interview and praised him deeply. After Mr. Wang entered the university, he learned about the doctrine of civil rights, which merged with his existing nationalistic thoughts, resulting in a great change in his thinking. He engaged in translating books. The money he earned was used as tuition for specialized courses. His monthly income was sixty gold coins, which was enough to support his family and help his friends. He said that studying law and politics abroad allowed him to understand the concept of the state and the concept of sovereignty residing in the people. The so-called monarchy was abandoned like dung. His original nationalistic thoughts rose up, and merged with the newly acquired civil rights thoughts, and he decided on a revolutionary direction. In the winter of that year, Sun Yat-sen established the Revolutionary Military Academy in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 8th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Jiachen year (1904 AD, the thirtieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-two years old. Mr. Wang was still in Japan, living with his family in the Ryukoku-kan in Nakasarugaku-cho. In this year, he graduated from the accelerated course and re-entered the Faculty of Law, Nihon University. Sun Yat-sen went to Hawaii to reorganize the Tan Shan Xin Bao, personally writing editorials and debating with the Bao Huang Dang's (Protect the Emperor Party) Xin Zhongguo Bao. He also wrote "The True Solution to the Chinese Question," which was the first declaration to the outside world by the party members.</p>
<p>The 7th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Yisi year (1905 AD, the thirty-first year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-three years old. In July, Sun Yat-sen founded the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in Tokyo, Japan, in the Kokuryukai (Black Dragon Society) in Hinokicho, Akasaka District. Mr. Wang went with Zhu Dafu to visit Sun Yat-sen at the Kindeikan in Kami-cho, and joined the Tongmenghui as a member. On the 30th, the Tongmenghui held a preparatory meeting and publicly elected Mr. Wang to draft the charter. On August 20th, the inaugural meeting was held at the residence of Itamoto Kanemi in Kasumigaseki, Akasaka District. Sun Yat-sen was publicly elected as the president, and Mr. Wang was a councilor. They discussed forming the Min Bao to promote revolutionary strategies. The Min Bao was published on October 21st. Mr. Wang, along with Hu Hanmin, Zhu Dafu, Zhang Binglin, Huang Kan, Liu Shipei, Wang Dong, Tang Zengbi, Tan Renfeng, Chen Tianhua, Hu Yanhong, and Zhu Jiaren, successively wrote editorials. Mr. Wang wrote articles advocating revolution, and the governor of Guangdong was shocked. He sent Zhu Shuqin (Zhiying) to Tokyo to persuade him, asking him not to discuss revolution, and tempting him with generous government funding for studying abroad and high official positions after graduation. Mr. Wang refused to see him. In this year, Mr. Wang's fifth sister, Yuan, passed away in Yangjiang, Guangdong.</p>
<p>The 6th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Bingwu year (1906 AD, the thirty-second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-four years old. Mr. Wang graduated from the Faculty of Law, Nihon University, and received a Bachelor of Laws degree. (He ranked second among more than 300 classmates at the time.) After graduation, he followed Sun Yat-sen to Nanyang to establish a branch of the Tongmenghui in Kuala Lumpur. He also went to Penang to establish a branch of the Tongmenghui. In Wu Shirong's Bilan Garden on Penang Island, he talked about revolution with Chen Jun and Xiangwu. They then went together to Singapore to introduce him to Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui. In June, he returned to Japan from Nanyang. On December 2nd, the Min Bao held its anniversary celebration at the Kinkikan in Tokyo. (The following continues on page 4)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Yesterday Was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday: Citywide Grand Commemoration, People from All Walks of Life Hold Commemorative Meeting <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 79th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. At 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the city held a grand commemorative meeting. Simultaneously, the City Party Headquarters, the City New Life Movement Branch, and the City Headquarters of the Youth Corps jointly organized ten mobile propaganda teams to carry out propaganda activities in various districts of the city. In the evening, Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, broadcast to the national public on Shanghai Radio. The commemorative event throughout the city was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life held a grand commemorative meeting at the Grand Theater. Attendees included bureau chiefs Liang Xiuyu, Su Chengde, Ye Xuesong, and Chen Qiushi from various municipal bureaus. Participants from all walks of life included over two thousand municipal civil servants, party members, military and police personnel, security personnel, youth corps members, and representatives from civic groups. The City Police Bureau band made a special appearance to play music, creating a very enthusiastic and uplifting atmosphere. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly, and the ceremony began on time. Yuan Ludeng and Liu Yangshan served as chairmen. After performing the ritual procedures, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech: He briefly stated that today's meeting of all sectors to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday is of great significance, which all of you present already deeply understand. Dr. Sun Yat-sen endured hardship and created the Republic of China, devoting himself for more than forty years, striving for the revolution until his death. Therefore, on this auspicious day commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we should practice Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, promote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, and at this time of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we should work even harder shoulder to shoulder with our ally Japan to overcome difficulties, develop a spirit of fearlessness, and achieve the true autonomy and independence of the Republic of China, and so on. Subsequently, Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, and Chen Binhe, the President of this newspaper, delivered speeches one after another, offering many warnings. Then, Liang Xiuyu, representing the presidium, led everyone in shouting slogans: (1) Realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, (2) Implement revolutionary principles, (3) Overthrow England and America and defend East Asia, (4) Complete unification and revitalize China, (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People, (6) Long live the Republic of China. The ceremony concluded, and afterwards, the China Film Greater East Asia newsreel and the film "Kai Feng" were screened until noon when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chen Binhe's Speech</p>
<p>President Chen of this newspaper said in his speech: Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 79th birthday. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for nearly twenty years, every year on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, the people of the whole country remember and reminisce with the most enthusiastic feelings because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's achievements in leading the revolution and creating the Republic of China, as well as inspiring the direction we should take, are truly great. There are three points worth mentioning when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday today: First, in November of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Dr. Sun Yat-sen gave a lecture on Pan-Asianism in Kobe, Japan. In January of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), he declared in Beijing the abolition of unequal treaties. Even in his will before his death on March 12, he still remembered the abolition of unequal treaties because Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that unequal treaties were shackles that bound the nation's freedom, and they must be abolished to achieve an independent and autonomous nation. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, domestic disputes continued, and unequal treaties still existed. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when China declared war on England and America, and Japan implemented its new policy towards China, that all concessions in China were returned by various countries and consular jurisdiction was abolished with Japan's sincere cooperation. By this time, the century-old shackles of unequal treaties were abolished, and the nation's independence and autonomy could be achieved. We believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven will surely be pleased and gratified for finally realizing the abolition of unequal treaties that he never forgot. Secondly, since China joined the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan have formed an alliance, forging a close relationship from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Later, the allied nations initiated the Greater East Asia Nations Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which further affirmed the mutual benefit, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity of the nations of East Asia, and has now realized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. We believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven must also be pleased and gratified.</p>
<p>Second, in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), when Dr. Sun Yat-sen returned to China from Japan, he said to Japanese journalists: "The people of China and Japan must unite and cooperate with one heart and one mind, combining into one force to succeed. If they are separated into two forces, they are bound to fail, and both will fail... However, the people of the two countries have their own hopes and their own difficulties, so they both want to unite but cannot implement it. Studying this to this point, the people of China and Japan must understand each other." Nearly twenty years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already pointed out the importance of mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of China and Japan. We have repeatedly advocated in recent years that government-to-government cooperation between China and Japan is necessary, and so is cooperation between the people of the two countries. In particular, the Japanese government should value the power of the Chinese people, and all policies must be suited to China's national conditions and popular sentiment. In this way, although there are different hopes and difficulties, they will surely be able to understand each other. Now we believe that the two countries are moving in this direction, and this is also something that can be reported to Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Third, after Marshal Togo defeated the Russian navy in the Russo-Japanese War, this news caused great sorrow to Europeans. The British believed that it would ultimately not be a blessing for the white race. Soon after, Dr. Sun Yat-sen happened to be returning to Asia from Europe by ship and passed through the Suez Canal. Arab locals asked to see him and inquired about the news of Japan defeating the Russian navy, expressing great joy because the Arab locals saw that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a yellow-skinned person. The victory of a yellow-skinned person evoked a kind of natural resonance. From then on, Dr. Sun Yat-sen felt even more strongly about the discrimination of white people against yellow people, and that yellow people should unite even more, so he became even more firm in his advocacy of Pan-Asianism. Now, since the Greater East Asia War, through the efforts of the allied nations, the forces of England and America have been driven out one after another, making Burma and the Philippines independent countries. India has established a provisional government, and the indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia have been given opportunities to participate in politics and freedom. This is also something that Dr. Sun Yat-sen extremely hoped for, and it has now been realized. Although our expectations for Dr. Sun Yat-sen can be gradually realized, we are still far from the ultimate goal. When we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we must not forget our efforts to seek further progress.</p>
<p>Liu Yangshan's Speech</p>
<p>Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, said in his speech: Today is the commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Whenever we welcome this day, we all regret and worry about the fate of China, and we eagerly hope for the future of the country. For decades, we have been anxious and disappointed. In the past, we felt even more disappointed with any meeting because the fate of the country was at a critical juncture of life and death, but we hoped for a glimmer of light for the future of the country.</p>
<p>Everyone already knows that our country's fate was oppressed by England and America in the early years, wearing shackles. Looking back, our country would never have suffered this situation if there had been no internal and external troubles, especially suffering deeply from the remnants of the Qing dynasty. When the Xinhai Revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Qing dynasty, we fully hoped that the fate of the country could improve and a modern country could be built. Unfortunately, the leaders failed to recognize the situation and were not firm in their revolutionary beliefs, so they were infected by the remnants of the Qing dynasty, creating the expansion of the Northern Warlords and being increasingly squeezed by imperialists. By the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Dr. Sun Yat-sen died worrying about the country, and the Chinese Nationalist Party improved at that time, so the general public had a deep understanding of the country and tried their best to oppose imperialism. Finally, in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), they launched the Northern Expedition Revolution and completed the unification of the entire country, so the future of China should have improved and a country based on the Three Principles of the People could have been built. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party provoked discord from within, launching conspiracies to disrupt the country, and civil war broke out again in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic (1929-1930). By the 21st year of the Republic (1932), people with foresight saw the danger of the country's fate, so they needed to unite. At that time, domestic figures abandoned all prejudices and assisted the National Government, hoping that our country could follow the right path and turn the future into peace. Who knew that it would be deeply envied by the British and American empires, trying to undermine China's revival, instigating the Communist Party to revive from the ashes, alienating Sino-Japanese relations, and instigating war against Japan, unfortunately causing the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). Our Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated Pan-Asianism twenty years ago, promoting the alliance and unity of all ethnic groups in East Asia to lay the foundation for East Asia. At first, Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw that the countries of East Asia were deeply invaded by white people, hoping to plan to defeat them one by one, with the ambition to completely destroy East Asia and make East Asians slaves of white people. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen tried his best to promote Pan-Asianism, and the Sino-Japanese Incident was their greatest conspiracy. It was not until December 8th, when the Greater East Asia War was launched by our ally Japan, that Pan-Asianism was realized. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy pointed the right path and can definitely achieve the expected goal.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese revolution is to seek China's freedom and equality, and to unite with the world's peoples to fight together on an equal footing. Therefore, we must overthrow the invading England and America. Now that Japan has abolished unequal treaties and returned concessions, we must closely link with Japan with sincerity and cooperation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out that there are yellow, white, red, and black races in the world, and the red and black races have been enslaved by the white race. Today's Greater East Asia War is for the yellow race to demand survival and resist the white race. If the Greater East Asia War unfortunately fails, we yellow races will face the same fate. Our fates are closely related, and we will not rest until the war ends with final victory. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a war for survival. The challenge of the English and Americans is hegemony, mobilizing troops and causing trouble. Our resistance is a war for royal righteousness and justice, waiting for the opportune moment. In reviewing the past and present national fortunes, we are indeed confident that final victory can be achieved. We must not worry or be depressed at the present time, but work together to achieve our goals.</p>
<h3 id="e13">After Chairman Wang's Death, The Entire City Mourns, City Government Agencies Will Still Work As Usual Today <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>After the news of Chairman Wang's death reached the city, the people of the entire city mourned unanimously. Today, the municipal government originally had a day off in commemoration of the Premier's birthday, but due to the above reasons, the municipal government specially ordered all agencies in the city to cancel the holiday and work temporarily today to show mourning.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Remarks</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu Songfu issued the following statement regarding the death of Chairman Wang:</p>
<p>The Chairman was a great leader of China and an extraordinary figure in East Asia. The Chairman's death is not only a loss for the Republic of China but also a loss for East Asia and the world. In addition to our shock and grief, we should fulfill our duty of every citizen being responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, work diligently in our respective positions, bravely advance, inherit the Chairman's legacy, and complete the mission of the era. Then, the significance of the peace movement can be extended, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be expected. I hope all citizens will strive together.</p>
<p>Director Liang's Remarks</p>
<p>Since the news of Chairman Wang's death reached Shanghai, the people of the entire city have mourned endlessly. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Director of Propaganda Liang Xiuyu, who made the following statement: The Chairman dedicated his entire life to the revolution and devoted himself to saving the country, not avoiding difficulties and not cherishing his life. With his consistent proposition and great sincerity, he inspired comrades and led the people of the country to wage continuous struggles against despotism, warlords, dictatorship, communism, and imperialism. His purpose was none other than to seek China's revival and East Asia's liberation. Although he did not see its completion and died carrying his aspirations, his spirit is immortal and his noble spirit will always exist. All of us citizens can only inherit his teachings, continue to work hard, and ensure that the motherland finally achieves autonomy and East Asia enjoys long-term co-prosperity, which is enough to comfort the Chairman's spirit in heaven. Although our National Government has experienced this major change, which is a loss not seen since the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, all arrangements have long been prepared, the unity is solid, and it will not be moved slightly. As for the friendly relations between our ally and us, it is an unshakable policy, and they will continue to provide strong support to assist the progress of our National Government. We can only focus our minds, follow the established national policy, increase production internally, ensure security, awaken the Chongqing side externally, defeat England and America to promote the realization of peace and unification, and the success of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Naval Baojia Contribute Aircraft <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and the naming ceremony for the aircraft contributed by the Naval Baojia was held at the same time, with an enthusiastic atmosphere and an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<p>The aircraft contributed by the Naval Baojia can be said to be a concrete manifestation of the Chinese people's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. From this, it can be further discerned that the Chinese people have recognized the essence of the Greater East Asia War and its close relationship with the interests of the country and themselves. Therefore, they have risen up and gathered their spiritual power to contribute aircraft to kill the enemy. This is a valuable event.</p>
<p>At the same time, this contribution of aircraft by the Naval Baojia represents the cooperative expression of a portion of the people. We believe that in the near future, it will further arouse the cooperation of the majority of the people, resulting in a larger number of contributed aircraft and a greater contribution of strength.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that the allied nations will further recognize the Chinese people's attitude of voluntary cooperation, pay special attention to the way of mutual benefit and harmony in contact with the Chinese people, so that all Chinese people can understand the sincerity of the allied nations and more actively express their cooperation. Then, the cornerstone for the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be made even more solid.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Commemorating Three Weeks of the Naval Baojia District: Yesterday's Aircraft Donation Ceremony; Allied Naval Minister's Representative General Kondo Presided Over Naming <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>To commemorate the third week since the establishment of the Baojia system in the Naval Garrison Area of this city, the aircraft donation and naming ceremony was solemnly held yesterday (the 12th) at 10:00 AM amidst air raid warnings. Tens of thousands of people, including officials from relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities and representatives of the Baojia citizenry, participated in the grand ceremony, their emotions running high. After the ceremony, the Allied naval aircraft performed aerial acrobatics, fully demonstrating their active combat prowess. Detailed accounts are as follows:</p>
<p>Officials and Guests</p>
<p>Officials and guests from both China and Japan present on the day included General Kondo, representing Naval Minister Yonai of the Allied Japan; Commander Katsuno Minoru of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force; Rear Admiral Minato, Naval Attaché of the Shanghai Garrison; Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the China Fleet; Major General Kawamoto, Head of the Army Department; Director Kumagai of the Transportation Liaison Department; and Councilor Okazaki, representing Minister Usami of the Embassy Office. On the Chinese side were Secretary-General Wu, representing Mayor Chen; Deputy Director Du of the Police Bureau; Chief Xiong of the Security Office; and prominent figures from all sectors, including Wen LantIng, Chen Riping, and Chen Binhe.</p>
<p>Aircraft Donation and Naming</p>
<p>The ceremony began promptly at ten o'clock. The entire assembly saluted the national flags of China and Japan, followed by the singing of the national anthems of both countries. After the anthems, a moment of silence was observed for the fallen soldiers of the Greater East Asia War, with prayers for victory in the war. Following the formalities, Xie Youde, the chief representative of the donors, presented twenty-two military aircraft and delivered a speech. Subsequently, General Kondo, representing Naval Minister Yonai, named the aircraft "Shanghai Baojia Patriotic Aircraft Nos. 1 to 22" and delivered an address of gratitude.

<p>Thank You Letter from the Allied Naval Minister</p>
<p>Today, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia, with a sincere desire to jointly destroy Britain and the United States, donated naval patriotic aircraft and held a grand naming ceremony. I, the Minister, am very pleased to be able to participate in this grand event. In modern warfare, aircraft can determine the victory or defeat of a war and play a great strategic role. The results of the naval and air battles in the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines have practically proven this. Enemy American warships and aircraft carriers, built with many years of effort, were sunk to the bottom of the sea in an instant by our elite air force. Therefore, the success or failure of future battles depends on the enrichment of air power. Now, the enemy's American air power has been greatly hit. In the future, they will rely on their productivity to devote all their energy to reconstruction work. Our Empire will also realize epoch-making upward expansion in the production of aircraft, warships, and weapons, both in quality and quantity, and will work harder to produce in response to the results of this battle to destroy the enemy. This autumn, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia District, taking the destiny of Greater East Asia as their own, ignited a sincere spirit of living and dying together, donating many excellent aircraft to strengthen the power of the Imperial Navy, for which I am extremely grateful. These aircraft, piloted by loyal and brave naval airmen, will be dispatched over the Pacific, and each aircraft will surely achieve glorious battle results to repay your sincerity. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the donors, and also express my thanks to all those who participated today.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Minato's Speech</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Minato, Chairman of the Naming Ceremony Committee, said: "Today, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia District of the Allied Republic of China are holding a naming ceremony for the patriotic aircraft they have donated. At this time of decisive battle, its significance is extremely profound. As the Chairman of this committee, I am extremely grateful. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our air force has achieved remarkable results in the Pacific and the entire war zone on the mainland, establishing a foundation for victory. The key to success lies in the loyalty and bravery of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and the excellent quality of our aircraft is also the main factor dominating the battle situation. It is clear that it is now an urgent task to transport a large number of elite aircraft to the front lines. The twenty-two patriotic aircraft donated today will surely establish a glorious feat in the skies of Greater East Asia. In the future, I hope that China and Japan will work hard to advance the spirit of living and dying together."</p>
<p>Katsuno Minoru's Speech</p>
<p>Commander Katsuno Minoru of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force gave a speech of instruction, briefly stating: "Today marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia and the aircraft donation naming ceremony. I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand event and express my thoughts. This time, in commemoration of the third anniversary of its founding, the Navy has donated new sharp aircraft, adding great power to the Empire's combat strength. It is especially sufficient to prove that all members of the Baojia truly understand the great ideal of the China-Japan alliance to complete the Greater East Asia War, and are moving towards its realization. I feel deeply happy. Now is the time to destroy the arrogant enemy Britain and the United States. Reports of victory from the front lines are coming one after another, but we must not be optimistic in the slightest until the enemy's wild ambitions are completely shattered. Therefore, we should be more vigilant against the disturbances of unruly elements on the enemy side and the attacks of enemy aircraft in the future. I hope that all Baojia citizens, under a strong belief, will further strengthen the posture of autonomy and self-defense, and jointly move towards the glorious path of completing the construction of the Greater East Asia grand cause."</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen said in his speech, "Today marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and an aircraft donation ceremony is being held. I am extremely honored to be able to participate in this grand event. I am very impressed by the efforts of the Naval Baojia in the past. Today, donating aircraft to the Allied Naval authorities can truly demonstrate the enthusiasm of the Chinese and Japanese people in cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more meaningful to celebrate the birthday of the Founding Father. Now that the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense, I hope that the Baojia in the Naval Garrison Area will donate aircraft, and promote this to other regions and even the whole country."</p>
<p>Usami's Speech</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, Usami Trhiko, said in his congratulatory speech, briefly stating: "It has been three years since the establishment of the Shanghai Naval Baojia, and today there is a move to donate 22 elite fighter planes to our Imperial Navy. I am inexplicably grateful for this. Our Empire has achieved unprecedented great victories in the waters east of Taiwan and the Philippines. Your donation of aircraft at this time is of great significance to the completion of the joint war. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 6 last year is to overthrow the aggressors of Asia. In the process of completing this goal, China and Japan are the axis of combat power, and also the center of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The relationship between China and Japan is most realistically expressed in Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of China's, saying, "We must share life and death, safety and danger." Today, with the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, the two countries have established a permanent friendly relationship and are cooperating with each other based on the spirit of morality. I sincerely express my gratitude and respect to all members of the Naval Baojia, and at the same time hope that in the future, we will work harder to complete the war and build East Asia."</p>
<p>Kubodera's Speech</p>
<p>Kubodera Tokuji said, briefly stating: "Today, we are celebrating the birthday of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, as well as the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and holding a naming ceremony for the aircraft donated by the sincere efforts of our 700,000 Baojia members. We are deeply grateful and feel infinitely honored to have the representative of the Naval Minister, the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Fleet, and many guests from China and Japan present, and to receive their earnest instruction. It has been more than three years since July 12, 1941, when the Baojia system, which Shanghai had previously considered impossible, was implemented in the Naval Garrison Area based on the order of the Chinese Fleet. During these three years, our Baojia colleagues, under the guidance of the Japanese Navy and with the cooperation and assistance of all parties, have overcome all difficulties and enabled this excellent system to be widely implemented in the whole of Shanghai, the whole of Central China, and the whole of China. Over the past three years, our Naval Baojia colleagues have further expanded the scope of their work in response to changes in the world situation and the needs of the social environment. In addition to achieving the expected goals of cooperating in maintaining public order, ensuring security, and clearing up society, they have also made considerable contributions to self-defense, air defense, youth training, and the distribution of goods. Moreover, the scope of their activities is expanding day by day. Depending on how they are guided and operated in the future, I am confident that there will be unlimited development in the future. The aircraft donation movement, which is holding a naming ceremony here today, was originally an expression of the current 700,000 residents in the district automatically rising up to defend their own sky. It lasted only one month, and as many as 22 aircraft were donated. As the person in charge of the Baojia, when I think of the full enthusiasm of the Baojia members, I cannot help but shed tears in admiration. On the one hand, this achievement should be attributed to the effective guidance of the Baojia colleagues. On the other hand, it can be said that the general Baojia members deeply understand the great righteousness of the China-Japan alliance and living and dying together. Therefore, they can work together and have a deep understanding of the common prosperity and shared decline of the two countries. This kind of sincere enthusiasm is enough to destroy the combat power of Britain and the United States, and is stronger than any weapon. This is something that is particularly exciting and gratifying.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) Yesterday (the 12th) at 3:00 PM, Kubodera Tokuji, Head of Naval Baojia Affairs, again met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in this city at the Bund Water Club to announce the organization and development of the Naval Baojia, and answered various questions from reporters from various newspapers. The meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Mr. Wang Jingwei's Chronological Biography (Transferred from the Second Edition) <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>5th Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Dingwei Year (1907 AD, 33rd Year of the Guangxu Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 25 years old. On the 20th day of the first month, he accompanied the Father of the Nation to Singapore and then to Annam. Secretly established branches in Hanoi, managing military affairs in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. On July 12th, the Nanyang Zhongxing Daily was published, opposing the Bao Huang (Protect the Emperor) Party's Zonghui Report. Mr. Wang and Hu Hanmin successively held the editorial pen. In this year, he went to Hong Kong again, devoting himself to the cause of revolution.</p>
<p>4th Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Wushen Year (1908 AD, 34th Year of the Guangxu Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 26 years old. Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Nanyang and went with Wu Yingpei to Rangoon to prepare for the establishment of a Tongmenghui branch. He also established the Nanyang branch in Singapore. In July, the Min Bao was banned. In this year, the Qing Jing Emperor died. Puyi succeeded to the throne, with Zaifeng as regent.</p>
<p>3rd Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Jiyou Year (1909 AD, 1st Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 27 years old. The Father of the Nation was in Singapore, and dispatched Mr. Wang and Deng Ziyu to places like the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to raise funds for support. However, at that time, many comrades who had failed in various places had fled to the British and Dutch colonies in Nanyang. They were quite dissatisfied with the measures taken by the Tongmenghui cadres. In addition, Zhang Binglin and Li Zhongzhu strongly advocated the Guangfuhui, harboring territorial prejudices. Mr. Wang was inevitably obstructed when he went to the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Wang was greatly angered and secretly went to Hong Kong, planning to assassinate an important Qing official to demonstrate the determination of the party members. Huang Xing knew about his plan after he left, and jointly sent a telegram with the Father of the Nation to dissuade him, but he did not listen. Mr. Wang then went to Japan and, with Huang Fusheng, Li Yongxi, Yu Peilun, Zeng Xing, Fang Junying, Chen Bijun, and others, organized a small assassination group. Fusheng and Peilun were well-versed in the manufacture of explosives. However, it was difficult to test them in Japan. Mr. Wang then went to Hong Kong with Zhongshi, Fusheng, Bijun, and Junying, and secretly set up a base in Wong Nai Chung Road. He arranged for Li Jitang to go to Deng Sanbo's farm in Tuen Mun to test various methods of throwing bombs and electrical, chemical, and clockwork detonation. Fusheng and Peilun heard that the Qing official Duanfang was taking the Beijing-Hankou Railway south. They went to Hankou ahead of time to lie in wait at the station to assassinate him, but were unsuccessful. Therefore, they entrusted Sun Wu with the bombs, iron casings, and ammunition they carried, and left. Mr. Wang spent more than a year planning the assassination, traveling back and forth between Japan and Hong Kong twice. In December, he finally decided to go to Beijing with Li Yongxi, Yu Peilun, Chen Bijun, and others, falsely setting up a Shou Yi Photography Studio to plot the assassination.</p>
<p>2nd Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Gengxu Year (1910 AD, 2nd Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 28 years old. On March 7th, Mr. Wang plotted to bomb the Qing Regent Prince, Zai Feng, with explosives at Yin Ding Bridge outside Andingmen in Beijing. The plot was revealed, and he was arrested and imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice. Chen Yijun and Yu Peilun, among others, had gone to Japan to purchase explosives the day before, and therefore escaped danger. He was imprisoned for more than a year before being released. Not only books, but also all the manuscripts he had written in his life were lost. (For details, see "A True Record of Mr. Jingwei's Ordeal in the Gengxu Year" compiled by me.)</p>
<p>1st Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Xinhai Year (1911 AD, 3rd Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 29 years old. On March 29th, Huang Xing, Zhu Dafu, Zhao Sheng, Lin Wen, and others launched an uprising in Guangzhou, besieging the Governor-General's office of Guangdong and Guangxi, with more than seventy deaths. This was the Huanghuagang Uprising, a great bloody battle for the nation. On September 16th, the Qing court released Mr. Wang from prison with a decree. Although the ban on parties had been relaxed, party members were all busy with their own affairs, concealing their whereabouts and unable to gather outside the prison gates to wait for him. Only his family went to meet him, and they went together to the Tai'an Inn in Luomashi. On August 19th, members of the Tongmenghui launched an uprising in Wuchang, overthrowing the Qing government and establishing the Republic of China. On November 25th, Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Shanghai. In that month, the Father of the Nation was elected as the Provisional President of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>1st Year of the Republic of China, Renzi Year (1912 AD). Mr. Wang was 30 years old. Mr. Wang was recommended as the head of the Northern Branch of the Tongmenghui. On January 1st, the Father of the Nation assumed the position of Provisional President. Mr. Wang served as a representative at the North-South Peace Conference in Shanghai to determine the location of the capital. He went north to negotiate with Yuan Shikai, and mediated the many disputes between the two sides. In this year, he married Chen Bijun, resigned from all political positions, and went to Guangzhou to visit his elder brothers and sisters-in-law. In August, he went to France. On the 25th, the Tongmenghui was reorganized into the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>2nd Year of the Republic of China, Guichou Year (1913 AD). Mr. Wang was 31 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. On April 27th, Yuan Shikai took out a large loan from the Five-Power Bank, which actually started the civil unrest in the Republic of China. The Father of the Nation was the strongest in resisting it. On November 4th, Yuan Shikai forcibly disbanded the Kuomintang and removed Chinese Kuomintang members from the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies. The Father of the Nation could not live peacefully in the country and revisited Japan.</p>
<p>3rd Year of the Republic of China, Jiayin Year (1914 AD). Mr. Wang was 32 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. On July 8th, the Father of the Nation established the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Tokyo.</p>
<p>4th Year of the Republic of China, Yimao Year (1915 AD). Mr. Wang was 33 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. The Father of the Nation still lived in Tokyo, presiding over the Chinese Revolutionary Party.</p>
<p>5th Year of the Republic of China, Bingchen Year (1916 AD). Mr. Wang was 34 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. Huang Xing returned from the Americas and died of heart disease in Shanghai.</p>

Mr. Wang traveled from France to England, then across the North Sea, passing through Norway, Sweden, and Finland to Petrograd, the Russian capital. Upon the summons of the Father of the Nation, he took the Trans-Siberian Railway back to China. The Father of the Nation lived in Shanghai, writing "The First Step of Civil Rights" and "The Question of China's Survival." In July, he went to Guangdong, declared the protection of the Constitution, and formed a military government.</p>
<p>7th Year of the Republic of China, Wuwu Year (1918 AD). Mr. Wang was 36 years old. Mr. Wang and Hu Hanmin formed the Guangdong Army. The officers and soldiers in the army were all appointed from party members. In August, the Father of the Nation was in Shanghai, sending telegrams to overseas comrades, drafting party regulations, and appointing Hu Hanmin as a representative to discuss peace.</p>
<p>8th Year of the Republic of China, Jiwei Year (1919 AD). Mr. Wang was 37 years old. Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Shanghai, founding the "Construction" magazine. Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Dafu, Dai Chuanxian, and others were with him. On October 10th, the Chinese Revolutionary Party was renamed the Kuomintang. In this year, the Father of the Nation wrote books such as "The Theory of Sun Wen" and "Industrial Plan."</p>
<p>9th Year of the Republic of China, Gengshen Year (1920 AD). Mr. Wang was 38 years old. In November, Mr. Wang returned to Guangzhou with the Father of the Nation and reopened the Political Affairs Conference. They sent telegrams across the country to restore the military government and issued a declaration to continue the revolutionary cause. In September, Zhu Dafu was killed in Humen.</p>
<p>10th Year of the Republic of China, Xinyou Year (1921 AD). Mr. Wang was 39 years old. On May 5th, the Father of the Nation took the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou. Mr. Wang always advocated the "Six No's" principle. To this end, he decided not to participate in politics and devoted himself wholeheartedly to party affairs. Furthermore, because Chen Jiongming was vying for power and acting despotically, he tried hard to dissuade him, which prevented a disaster. After the Father of the Nation obtained Pinggui, he led his army on a northern expedition.</p>
<p>11th Year of the Republic of China, Renxu Year (1922 AD). Mr. Wang was 40 years old. On June 16th, Chen Jiongming betrayed the country, and the Father of the Nation suffered hardship in the Presidential Palace. He escaped danger and went to Shanghai on August 13th. Mr. Wang followed him.</p>
<p>12th Year of the Republic of China, Guihai Year (1923 AD). Mr. Wang was 41 years old. On February 21st, the Father of the Nation returned to Guangzhou and exercised the authority of the Grand Marshal. Since military power was manipulated by warlords, there was a move to reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang. Mr. Wang was summoned back to China and, together with Liao Zhongkai and Hu Hanmin, jointly convened the First National Congress.</p>
<p>13th Year of the Republic of China, Jiazi Year (1924 AD). Mr. Wang was 42 years old. On January 1st, the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang was held in Guangzhou. All the declarations were drafted by Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee at the meeting, and also served as the Minister of Propaganda. In this year, the Whampoa Military Academy was established. Mr. Wang often went to give lectures, elaborating on the history and doctrines of the party. On November 31st, he went to Beijing with the Father of the Nation to discuss opening a National Assembly with the Executive Duan.</p>
<p>14th Year of the Republic of China, Yichou Year (1925 AD). Mr. Wang was 43 years old. Mr. Wang assisted the Father of the Nation in resisting Duan's proposal to convene a Post-Affairs Conference, firmly advocating the convening of a National Assembly. On March 12th, the Father of the Nation died of illness at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Mr. Wang attended him at his deathbed and was instructed to draft his will. After the Father of the Nation died, Mr. Wang also suffered from a serious illness, but still stayed in Beijing with effort, hoping to promote the convening of the National Assembly. Previously, Mr. Wang had four older sisters, who had married into the Wang family in Jianchang, Jiangxi, a long time ago. Mr. Wang had not heard from them for more than thirty years. Mr. Wang was devoted to his relatives, so he went to visit them alone in the summer of this year. At that time, the roads in Jiangxi were blocked, and Jianchang was located deep inland. There were no inns to stay in along the way. Mr. Wang walked alone, sleeping in dilapidated temples or under trees at night. After many hardships, he finally found the location of his fourth sister and escorted her to Guangzhou. At that time, his fourth sister was blind in both eyes. He quickly hired a doctor to perform surgery. Fortunately, one eye was restored to sight. She is still alive and healthy, and is over seventy years old. In June, he arrived in Guangzhou and was elected as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Government Committee, and also served as the Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee. At that time, the struggle between the left and right factions was becoming increasingly fierce. The communists took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated. Mr. Wang struggled to maintain the precarious situation, reorganizing the National Revolutionary Army. On November 3rd, Zou Lu and others of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang held an illegal meeting in Xishan, Beiping, under the pretext of anti-communism, opposing Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>15th Year of the Republic of China, Bingyin Year (1926 AD). Mr. Wang was 44 years old. On January 1st, the Second National Congress was held in Guangzhou. Mr. Wang was elected as the chairman. On the 27th, he proposed the Northern Expedition to the Central Political Conference. Unfortunately, Chiang Kai-shek was surrounded by the Xishan Conference faction and the Communist Party, resulting in the March 20th Guangzhou coup. Mr. Wang did not want to cause division within the party, so he resolutely resigned. In May, he went to France. Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek regretted it and telegraphed Mr. Wang to return to China to take charge of the government. He left France in December and returned quickly.</p>
<p>16th Year of the Republic of China, Dingmao Year (1927 AD). Mr. Wang was 45 years old. On April 1st, Mr. Wang returned to China via Marseilles and arrived in Shanghai. He met with Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang, and strongly argued that the expulsion of communists was too hasty. Disagreeing with their opinions, he returned to France from Shanghai.</p>
<p>17th Year of the Republic of China, Wuchen Year (1928 AD). Mr. Wang was 46 years old. He stayed in France to avoid the noise and disturbances.</p>
<p>18th Year of the Republic of China, Jisi Year (1929 AD). Mr. Wang was 47 years old. In March, Chiang Kai-shek convened the Third National Congress in Nanjing. Mr. Wang, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, and others issued a declaration, condemning it as illegal. In September, he left France and returned to China. Feng Yuxiang and Bai Chongxi and others dispatched troops to denounce Chiang.</p>
<p>19th Year of the Republic of China, Gengwu Year (1930 AD). Mr. Wang was 48 years old. Yan Xishan thought of allying with the left wing of the Kuomintang and dispatched troops to attack Chiang. In July, he welcomed Mr. Wang to the north and convened an enlarged meeting. Mr. Wang still advocated opening a National Assembly and implementing political tutelage.</p>
<p>20th Year of the Republic of China, Xinwei Year (1931 AD). Mr. Wang was 49 years old. Because Hu Hanmin was imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek, the whole country was in turmoil and everyone rose up to condemn him. They all went to Guangzhou and appointed Mr. Wang as their leader. Not long after, the September 18th Incident occurred. Mr. Wang believed that the national crisis was urgent and that internal unity was essential. Therefore, he went to Shanghai to negotiate with the representatives of the Ning Faction and decided to abolish the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference and launch the National Salvation Conference.</p>
<p>21st Year of the Republic of China, Renshen Year (1932 AD). Mr. Wang was 50 years old. Mr. Wang headed the Executive Yuan. Because the Japanese army in the Northeast continued to attack Jinzhou, followed by the Battle of Shanghai, he moved the capital to Luoyang. A ceasefire agreement was reached. In late October, he left the country, leaving behind a letter to bid farewell. He expressed his views on national affairs.</p>
<p>22nd Year of the Republic of China, Guiyou Year (1933 AD). Mr. Wang was 51 years old. On March 17th, Mr. Wang returned to China and again headed the Executive Yuan. He advocated peaceful negotiations with Japan and reached the Tanggu Truce with Japan. North China relied on this for temporary peace.</p>

<p>24th Year of the Republic of China, Yihai Year (1935 AD). Mr. Wang was 53 years old. Mr. Wang remained the head of the Executive Yuan. He strongly believed that disputes between the two countries should be resolved with sincerity, regardless of the jealousy of his political enemies. He was attacked on November 1st when the Fourth Session of the Sixth Central Committee opened. (For details, see "The Full Story of Mr. Wang Jingwei's Assassination Attempt in the Yihai Year" compiled by me.)</p>
<p>25th Year of the Republic of China, Bingzi Year (1936 AD). Mr. Wang was 54 years old. Mr. Wang went abroad for medical treatment. On November 9th, Mr. Wang's close friend Hu Hanmin passed away at the age of 58.</p>

He strongly advocated conducting peace negotiations with Japan, but was obstructed by the Communist Party. In December of this year, the capital fell, and Mr. Wang's residence was reduced to ashes. Of all the writings he had done in the past thirty years, the only surviving drafts were the translations of Yangming and Zen.</p>
<p>27th Year of the Republic of China, Wuyin Year (1938 AD). Mr. Wang was 56 years old. The Kuomintang convened a National Provisional Congress in Chongqing. Mr. Wang and Chiang Kai-shek were both appointed as the Director-General and Deputy Director-General, respectively, and were given the authority to negotiate peace with Japan. However, the communist party dictatorship did not support it. Therefore, he fled from Chongqing to Hanoi and issued the "Yan Telegram" on December 29th, calling for a ceasefire and peace with the Japanese side. On February 28th of this year, Mr. Wang re-translated and published his Yangming and Zen manuscripts from thirty years ago into a book.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Mr. Wang Jingwei's Autobiography <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>My ancestral home is Shanyin, Zhejiang. The graves of my ancestors are all in Shanyin. My father was the first to move to Panyu, Guangdong. Although he could understand Cantonese, he could not speak it. He was still a native of Zhejiang. He first married Ms. Lu, who was also from Zhejiang. She bore one son and three daughters. My mother's surname was Wu, and she was a native of Guangdong. She bore three daughters and three sons. I am the fourth among the brothers, and the tenth counting the sisters. When I was born, my father was already sixty-two years old. I was thirteen years old when my mother died. I was fourteen years old when my father died. The time I spent with my parents was only this much. That included the time I was an infant and unaware of the world. All together, it was not more than ten years. I only remember my father as a diligent student. After the age of seventy-one, his eyes were affected by cataracts and he could not see small characters. He also had severe hearing loss. When I came home from school in the evening, my father would always make me read aloud two or three pages of Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" and other books. He would listen intently. He would also make me write three or four-inch large characters on a white-painted wooden board, such as Tao Yuanming's poems or Lu You's poems. He would watch me slowly from behind until I could recite them by heart. He would not stop until I could. Whenever I had a composition, he would make me write it down. My father contracted cholera in the middle of the night on the seventh day of the ninth month and died at noon on the eighth day. The homework was not interrupted the night before he died. For myself, the benefit I received from this seemed to be greater than in school. When I think of my mother, I am truly saddened. I feel that her entire life was immersed in worry and hardship. The difficulties of making a living, the trivial matters of household affairs, and the unreasonable anger she suffered within the family still appear vividly before my eyes. I have a scroll of "Autumn Garden Morning Lesson Picture" and a preface that briefly describes my mother's life and my childhood. When my father was alive, the family's finances were already meager. My father had to earn money to support the family until he was seventy years old. He finally retired at the age of seventy-one. After my father died, there was no inheritance. My expenses for food and clothing were all supported by my elder brother. At the age of seventeen, I went out to become a "Master Ziyue" (private tutor), earning ten yuan a month. I also went to various academies to take exams, often achieving excellent results, earning an average of about twenty yuan per month. At the age of eighteen, my third elder brother died. At the age of nineteen, my second elder brother died. I relied on this income to support two widowed sisters-in-law and an orphaned nephew. In a word, my childhood life was poor and miserable. As for my studies, because I only received education from a "Master Ziyue," subjects like foreign languages, arithmetic, and physical education were out of the question. After the age of sixteen, when I became a "Master Ziyue" myself, not only were they out of the question, but because of time and economic constraints, I could not even dream of them. Therefore, my life lacks general knowledge. Even my physical movements are stiff and awkward. This is something I am ashamed of when I think about it. Fortunately, in addition to receiving education from a "Master Ziyue," I also received some home education. My uncle was very learned and had a collection of tens of thousands of books. Therefore, I also glimpsed something of the classics, history, philosophy, and literary collections. But what does this count for?</p>
<p>When I turned twenty, I actually got the opportunity to be admitted as a government-sponsored student to study law at the Japanese Political Science Accelerated Course. After graduating from the accelerated course in Tokyo, I entered a specialized course at my own expense. The money for my own expenses came from translating books. However, at that time, translating books was only for money. Such as "Complete Collection of Laws and Regulations" and other things, purely a hired kind of work. When I was a government-sponsored student, I only got thirty yuan a month. When I was paying my own way, my monthly income was actually fifty or sixty yuan. In addition to using it myself, I could also help friends.</p>
<p>When I was studying history in China, I inevitably felt indignation towards the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties for their encroachment on China. Naturally, I felt the same towards the Qing. But I was bound by what they call the righteousness between ruler and subject. When I came to study law and political science, I got a sense of national mission and the concept that sovereignty rests with the people. What I used to call the righteousness between ruler and subject was thrown to the four winds. My inherent ethnic ideology rose up and combined with the newly acquired democratic ideology, which determined my revolutionary direction. In the Yisi year, when I was twenty-two years old, Mr. Sun came to Tokyo. I and Zhu Zhixin and a few others went to meet him and join the Chinese Tongmenghui. This was the beginning of my dedication to the revolution. At that time, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi was Cen Chunxuan. My eldest brother was in his office, working with a Mr. Liu Zifan. The two of them were friends. My eldest brother had arranged for me to be engaged to one of his younger sisters. This kind of thing cannot be done now. But at that time, it was considered the essence of reason and human feeling. The eldest brother thought that if he did not get a wife for his brother after his father died, he would be gossiped about. So he did it this way. Not only did he not need my consent, he did not even need to notify me. This went on for several years. Suddenly, I heard that I had become a revolutionary. They could not help but be alarmed. The more articles I wrote in the Min Bao, the tighter the rumors became. One day, Cen Chunxuan got drunk and insisted that my eldest brother hand me over. Otherwise, he would be sorry for my eldest brother. In a panic, I wrote a final family letter, signing myself as the "Sinner of the Family." I still remember this letter today. I write it below: "The matter has been discovered. I hereby sever myself from the family to avoid implicating you. There are many children in the family. Why begrudge this one person? I hope you will let him shed blood for the country to fulfill his ambition. Death is imperishable. However, I hope you will treat my widowed sister-in-law and orphaned nephew well. Otherwise, I will not rest in peace in death. Moreover, this is not what the sinner should declare. I had a marriage agreement with Ms. Liu. But since the sinner has severed ties with the family, then this relationship should also be severed with it. Please dissolve the engagement from today." After receiving this letter, my eldest brother posted a notice at Panyu county, banishing the rebellious younger brother from the household permanently. He conferred with Liu Zifan, returned the betrothal gifts to the Liu family and burned the marriage contract, completing the matter. Later, I heard that Ms. Liu was against them doing this. Until the first year of the Republic, when I had already married, I returned to Guangzhou and revisited my family. I heard that she had not yet married. I felt as the ancients said, “Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me.” I could not help but feel uneasy. Until I heard that she had married a Mr. Chen, I was relieved. I joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-two. This year, I am fifty-one years old. In these thirty years, I do not want to say much about what I have been through. Because as for before the Republic, starting from the Yisi year, my opinions and discussions were all published in the Min Bao. After the Dingwei year, I was ordered by Mr. Sun to travel to Nanyang, organizing more than a hundred Tongmenghui branches. At that time, all the speeches and discussions were published in the Zhongxing Daily. After the Yiyou year, I sneaked into Beijing and was captured and placed in prison. I also had a poem expressing my feelings, which was published in the "Small Rest Collection." My prison life was also recorded in "Nanshe Poetry Talks". These can all be considered my autobiography. I remember that on the seventh day of the third month of the Gengxu year, I was arrested by the police in Beijing. In my jacket, they found "Revolutionary Tendency", "Revolutionary Determination", and "Farewell to Comrades". They asked me why I kept these articles on my body. I replied that there was no other reason. However, I felt that using ink to write was not enough. I wanted to write with blood. So I kept it on my body, prepared for when I died, so that some blood would be on them. Therefore, I feel that taking my lifelong speeches and discussions as my autobiography is the most authentic. There is no need to write another autobiography. This is also the case after the Republic. However, the matters after the Republic are much more complicated than before the Republic. My revolutionary determination has certainly never changed. But my attitude towards people and things is inevitably subject to change. But I have always reasoned out the reasons for the changes. As for whether the reasons are right or wrong, I am willing to accept the comments of people now and in the future. (Recorded from the Baiyuantang Bookstore)</p>
