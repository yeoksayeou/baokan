<p>社評</p>
<h3>改善監獄衛生</h3>
<p>故司法行政部長張一鵬先生，以斑疹傷寒症不治致死。聞致病之由，係視察本市馬斯南路看守所囚犯病房時，為囚犯白蝨所傳染·因此，嚴格的說，張氏之死，並非死於壽，而謂死於盡獄之不衛生者，亦無不可·况張氏以部長之尊，親履監獄實地視察，其目的自不外於改善監獄設備，改善囚犯待遇，改善監獄衛生，包括於囚犯待遇，正為張氏所計劃改善者，乃不幸改善監獄衛生之計劃尚未實現，而決定計劃者竟以此致死，我們固不禁為張氏哀悼，同時，更為監獄衛生改善前途悲惜。</p>
<p>我們確知當張氏在接任司法行政之初，即積極注意因犯待遇，如力爭因糧之增加，籌措囚犯之醫藥費，並會竭力向各方勸捐款項，購備囚犯需要之藥品，於此兩事更可見張氏之親履監獄，是考察監獄衛生，從而決定改善計劃巳無疑義。因此，我們希望今後司法當局，首先對於監獄衛生，速籌改良，不僅囚犯普遍受惠，亦不負張氏遺志，且以慰張氏在天之靈。</p>
<p>本市馬期南路看守所，內容房舍設備等比較一般監獄爲勝，而囚犯兵者累累。並聞看守所長，近亦正患斑疹傷寒，從而可知其他各地監獄設備更簡陋者，其易致疾病之機會尤多，爲整個監獄衛生，保障囚犯生命之計，更有從速計劃改善口之必要。</p>
<p>科刑之本旨，不在處罰犯人，乃在懲戒犯人期其改善品性，改善之結果，使其將來成為社會之善良分子。因此，囚禁犯人，勞苦其精力，磨練其意志，則是應有之事。如獄舍骯髒，不顧清潔，疾病　生，不顧發藥，任其自生自減，誠是人間地獄者，既非法律所許，亦與大道有　。我們本於改善監獄衛生之原則，提供管見數點：</p>
<p>勤勤勞原為每個囚犯之第一義務。對於獄舍之整潔，應由監獄管理人員嚴格督促囚犯各自處理。據一般推想，獄舍無論如何簡陋，經費無論如何支絀，洒掃整潔之事，並不至因此廢弛。况且，淸潔並非奢華之事，而從勤勞中得來。淸潔以後，直接减少疾病傳染機會，間接即减少醫藥經費。希望司法行政當局制定具體辦法，通飭各監獄人員認真執行。</p>
<p>各地衛生機關，對於公共衛生之推行，應特別指導監獄術生之設施，與監獄管理人員取得聯絡，經常視察指導。醫如佈種牛痘，注射防疫，消毒等等，在監獄中普遍施行。希望司法當局與衛生當局商定具體辦法，隨時實施。</p>
<p>設立囚犯醫院與診據所，視監獄範圍與囚犯人數之需要，酌量在監獄內設置，由司法行政部籌措經費，必要時向社會勸募。</p>
<p>監獄中衛生設備，如沐浴塲所，厠所等等，均應普遍設置，一切淸潔事宜均由囚犯擔任。</p>
<p>看守所拘押囚犯，雖為時較暫，但亦須注意衛生，否則羈押待決志囚，或無辜被累之輩，一入鐵窗，極易傳染病，不　宣告死刑，即幸而抵抗力強者，亦九死一生，個人健康固屬塲告，公家醫療亦多糜費。</p>
<p>總之，監獄衛生，並不是理想而難於實現的，祗須辦法妥當，管理嚴密，必能漸次收效，願司法當局積極圖之。</p>
<h3>日海軍大臣更迭野村大將就新任　島田大將專心負軍令重任</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電日情報局十七日空表：海軍大臣島田繁太郎辭職照准，後任者為海軍大將正四位勳一等功三級野村直邦，業於十七日下午五時舉行親任式。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社电　日政府為適應現下重大戰局，曾就集結必勝總力之途，作種種檢討，此次決定更迭海軍大臣，由吳鎮守府司令長官野村直邦大將繼任，日東條首相　於十七日下午二時晋宮呈上奏文，至五時遂於東條首相侍立下舉行親任式，業由日情報局發表。</p>
<p>野村海相略歷</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電野村海相，鹿兒島縣人，明治四十年（光緒三十三年）十一月海軍兵學校卒業，大正八年（民國八年）任海軍少佐，同時一年任駐德海軍武官，同十三年歸國後任中佐，十四年一月任潛水艦隊司令，昭和三年（民國十七年）晋升大佐，任長鯨艦長，同四年（民國十八年）任日駐德大使館隨從武官，同六年（民國二十年）九月返國後，任羽黑艦長，同八年（民國二十二年）任加賀艦長，同年末任潛水學校校長，九年（民國二十三年）晋升少將，任潛水戰隊司令官，十年（民國二十四年）任聯合艦隊參謀長，十一年（民國一」十五年）任軍令部部長，十三年（民國二十七年）晋升中將，十四年（民國二十八年）三月任駐滬海軍武官，同年十二月任華北海軍最高指揮官，十五年（民國二十九年）十一月赴歐，十八年（民國三十二年）六月任軍事參議官，同年十月任吳鎮長官，本年三月晋升大將，至是今職，</p>
<p>松島部長談話</p>
<p>中央社電　日駐華艦隊報導部長松島大佐，頃就野村海軍大將就任海相事，發表談話，闡明其意義。松島大佐談稱：此次野村直邦海軍大將親任海軍大臣，因此過去以海軍大臣兼任軍令部總長之島田大將，得專心負起遂行軍令之大任，而以軍令軍政截然分為兩事之海軍傳統精神，又告復歸。在過去半年內，身兼二職之島田大將，可解一半項任，由野村大將專任海相，此為現在重大戰局下發揮海上作戰效果之措置，於今後戰局上，當有重大意義存在焉。</p>
<h3>中村海軍大將　論東亞戰局　日本已佔有地理優勢</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日海軍大將中村良三氏，頃於七月號「太平洋雜誌」上以「東亞戰局已至決戰階段」為題，對歐洲及東亞戰同詳為論述，其關於東亞戰局論述如次：美國艦隊力，據金格聲明為戰艦二十艘，故北卡羅來納型六艘全部就役，阿華型似亦有兩艘就航，傳聞舊戰艦三艘出動於西法戰綫，其殘餘部之十七艘，除屢次被日軍擊沉者外，全部則配備於南太平洋上。傳聞航空母艦愛賽克斯型六艘就役，又五艘似已入水，或將於最近出現於戰綫，印迭奔典斯型九艘就役，此外，似尚有艦數不明之艦船在改裝中，其中空母將有若干出動於太平洋上，雖不得明瞭，正式或巡洋艦改裝者，全部航於太平洋上，其總數似已達四十以上。美艦隊之外，印度洋方面尚有英國艦隊，其中亦配有空母艦若干艘，美國更計算建造排水量四萬五千噸之空母陣，但出現於此戰綫，尚需相當時日，補助艦艇雖尚不明其詳細情形，但戰前之巡洋艦三十一艘及建造中之五十四艘之多，經珍珠灣戰後，因緊急製造計劃結果，重巡洋艦五十艘，已大部分就役。吾人更觀地圖，即可明白，自日本本土經過伊豆羣島，小笠原羣島，馬利亞納·雅普島·巡勞島·多哥貝中，新幾內亞西端連結之綫，即為日本防備太平洋之幹綫。在北部有南為島，大島島可作前進基地，其他部份則以單綫關係，構成陣綫極難，敵人突破作戰，敵之侵攻馬利亞納，相繼壓迫迭尼安，羅特島，企圖形成太平洋基地羣，制壓附近海空，確保後方安全，企圖突入中國或北上侵犯小笠原羣島展開活動作戰及空襲日本本土之疑兵式活動在所不免。敵美為此等補助作戰，絕不會用盡力量而放棄其主要目的，塞班島一經攻佔，則防備綫之南端即受影響，並或使麥克沃塞軍由比阿克島進出於此，南北步調取得聯絡一致，太平洋之戰塲，可移至中國海，於此處，日本對敵人之反擊最高方策雖非吾人所能窺知，但僅就地理所佔優越地位觀之，其勝利必在日方無疑。</p>
<h3>桂林開始　疏散人口</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　據路透社重慶電，渝方常局　於湖南廣東兩戰綫之日軍，節節進展，恐其攻向桂林，特下令使桂林市民避難，一切工業設施，盡量移向內地。不能移動之設要設施，則　力破壞。又據美聯社特派員報稱，挂林南方要街柳州之情勢，謂柳州為廣西重要交通要術，刻柳州軍當局已對市民發出避難命令，聲言係為防備空襲，及降落傘部隊攻擊之危險，但實際之原因，仍係恐受日軍降落傘部隊之攻擊。避難自七月十七日間始，首先為婦孺，次為主要公務人員，再次為一般市民，僅軍隊及義勇軍等滯留市內。</p>
<h3>國府開濬　大運河計劃</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　國民政府前為修廣大運河，經積極籌備，結果決定全部工事預定五年完成，業經於本年四月一日開始，刻正着手進行中。茲悉第一期工事，爲自山東江蘇省境台兒莊起，至揚子江岸瓜州間，預定至十一月完成。堂此設工事完成后，即可使資河淮河長江太湖互相連結，大運河之全長四分之一，即告暢通。該段沿岸為人口最稠密，物產最豐富地帶，以運河之開通，戰爭資源之增產與運送，頗　期待，國民政府之政治經濟各方之發展，亦歲之强化，</p>
<h3>中樞紀念週</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　中央黨部十七日舉行第二一〇次紀念週，到六百餘人，　秘書長民誼主席，周委員學員報告「民食問題與物價問題」。</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　國府十七日舉行週會，文官參軍兩處職員全體參加，徐文官長主席報告法治問題。</p>
<h3>漢市設立　米糧收買處</h3>
<p>漢口十七日中央社電　漢口市米糧評價收買處或　後，設立辦公處於市商會內，業於日昨正式展開工作。該處近以新　即可登場，決先在市郊四處　口，分設米糧集中收買處六處，以利收買工作</p>
<h3>國府下半年預算重點在軍費方面　總數約當上半年</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　財政部於昨（十七）日上午十時，舉行定例會見中外記者，由該部次長陳之碩出席，對國府下半年度之預算，與最近之黃金買買，滬市股票市塲，及普遍征收消費特稅等各問題，詳細說明，茲逐一錄后：</p>
<p>（預算問題）關於三十三年下半年度之預算，本應早經擬具，提請行政院會議議決，但以事實需要增多，加之物價上漲，預算亦形應大，須待與各有關方面聯絡。本部周部長預定本日返京，繼續與各方洽商後，當可決定。此次預算重盟，在軍費方面，與改善公務員之待遇，關於預算數字，現尚未正式決定，總數約當上半年度一倍以上。</p>
<p>取締黃金投機</p>
<p>（黃金買賣）國府現時對黃金尚未絕對統制，故對黃金買賣僅擬定時取締辦法。關於此點，報章已迭有發一表，最近以滬市黃金忽告突漲，故財政部頃發表取締辦法，此實為對症下藥之對策。財政部原禁止以黃金作押款，但滬市有一般不肖行莊，陽奉陰遠，現財政部已命令中備金融據查處，檢查各該行莊賬目，調查結果，雖尚未呈部，但部方已悉有數銀行，已有此不法行為。此各行莊會有已受財部處罰者，但以正式報告尚未到達，不擬發表其行名，自檢查工作開始後，金價已見下落，不過金價上漲之其他原因，為物資缺乏，實亦為不可避免之事實耳·</p>
<p>奸商操縱股市</p>
<p>（股票市場）至今年正月起，股票即行下瀉，迄未上漲。其正當原因，以各工廠之物質缺乏，動力電力減少，出產量减少，因之股票下跌。但亦有股票不應跌而跌者，其與操縱黃金貿翼之各不肖進行，亦有關係。以各該行莊以股票爲投機力量雄厚足以操縱股舉市塲，盡力使股票跌落。各行莊之往來戶頭，有以股票作押欵者，因股票之下落低於押款數目，於是强迫各戶來贖。其有無力贖出者，各行莊為保證其正當利益，遂有權處分此抵押品，而各股票遂落入各行莊手。類此情况，發生甚多，因之股票為　等操縱，此種互為因果之關係，遂使股票一蹶不振。近日因滬市已在檢查各行莊賬目，故股票市塲已略轉佳象。</p>
<p>（普普徵徵收消費特稅）該稅之征收，最初規定為蘇浙皖三省內十五都市，京滬兩市區，實施迄今，成績尚佳。自五月十六日起，所有三省兩市均普遍遍征收。據估計每月一萬萬兩千萬元。武漢方間現亦希望開征，財部現正審核中</p>
<p>通貨絕未膨脹</p>
<p>（中儲通貨之發行）中　當局爲適應需要，應滬銀錢業公會之請求而發行五百兀券其結果是否影響通貨膨脹與</p>
<p>物價上漲，關於此點試分言之。先言通貨膨脹之發生，須視財政之收支是否平衡，與社會金融之需要供求情况而定。自國府還都，財政以量入為出原則與重點主義為施策，故始終無赤字數字，因此絕無通貨膨脹之現象發生。再言社會金融之需要，現時需要量與飽和點相差尚遠，故不致影響物價上漲，此乃中儲銀行行與中央財政當局，再三審慎研討罰行伍佰元劵後，絕無一綫影響，始決定發行者。現時世界各國銀行，雖均有準備，但均趨法幣一途，以中儲行書，準備在六成以上，各國銀行制有如此準備者甚少，現時各國銀行趨向法幣一途，於戰事結東後，各國必有其適當處置辦法，則是時我國亦可參考行云，故關於增加通貨發行，實不足爲憲。</p>
<h3>蕪湖米價復漲</h3>
<p>蕪湖十七日中央社電　本縣米價前曾一度猛　，近以滬幫吸收，又復趨漲。計一等機白米三千八百元，次者三千四百元，上漲亦售三千二百元。</p>
<h3>高考及格受訓　公務員支原薪</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　本屆臨時高考，當局特專呈國府，轉飭各機關，對在職公務員應試本屆高考及格者，受訓訓期間，照支原薪。</p>
<h3>粉麥委會劃定　華中收買區域　並實施保證金制度</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　商統會粉麥委員會，自於去年制定粉麥收買暫行辦法，暨粉麥製造加工暫行辦法，分別推進，收買小麥暨麵粉製造工作。茲為求工作更圓滑之推進，決定於蘇浙皖三省，京滬兩市區域內之麥類糧行製粉工廠，實施保體金制度。規定糧行三萬兀，麥粉工廠五萬元。此外又為避免區域間之摩擦，以求收買最之增加起見，特於華中各產區，劃定收買區域範圍。茲將所規定收買地區範圍錄如下：　上海地區，滬杭浙贛沿綫全區，從海關鐵道沿綫以至黃渡·上海·寶山·浦東·嘉定·崇明一帶·　蘇州地區，沿京滬綫從安亭至崑山，經蘇州至望亭·吳江·大倉·常熟·靑浦一帶。　無錫地區，沿京滬綫從周涇港至無錫，經石塘灣至洛社。江陰。北部一帶。　常熟地區，沿京滬綫從橫林經戚　堰至宜興一帶。　南京地區，沿京滬綫從樓震山至南京，津浦沿綫從浦口至浦鎮·句容·深水·江寗·江浦。六合·東葛鎮一帶。　鎮江地區，沿京滬綫從丹陽經鎮江至龍潭·金壇·溁陽一帶·　蕪湖地區，沿京蕪綫從采石經蕪湖至灣沚一帶。又淮南綫廣州及荻港·銅陵·和縣一帶。　蚌埠地區，沿津浦綫從花旗營經滁縣。羅店·明光·臨淮關·至蚌埠沿綫淮河上流一帶。　揚州地區，從揚州經邵伯。高郵·汜水·至實應大運河，包括興化·湖西·天長·儀徽一帶地區。　泰縣地區泰縣及姜堰·東台·盟城·南通一帶。　　安慶地區從大通至安慶揚子江一帶地區。</p>

<p>緬甸日軍前綫十七日中央社電　日軍機隊會奇　北緬甸地空挺部隊之基地密芝那飛機場，擊毀其P40戰鬥機及道格拉斯職送機攻擊三十九架，聞此赫赫大戰果枝寺內南方方面陸軍最高指揮官，特拍電祝賀，並激勵今後再接再厲，此次之奇襲出動時，正值豪雨時，飛至敵機塲滑走路西側上空時，發見P40戰鬥機二十三架與道格拉斯輸送機相併於地上，在隊長發下命令之同時，全機猛然俯下，投下第一彈時，羅烈之P40機全被粉碎，漆黑之燃料橫益於地面，機塲之全部範　在猛火里烟中。</p>

<p>渝美兵員補充困難</p>
<p>中央社訊　據昆明來電稱，北緬方面蠢動渝美軍，由於日機之猛烈轟炸，　受重大打擊後，力圖兵員之補充，渝軍十五日決定，派遣現於責陽訓練中之教育團補充該國之一大國，業於十四日到達昆明，等待飛機輸送，近更以第二與第三大隊，亦將抵昆明。以飛機輸送之兵補充消耗終感困難，故渝方對兵員之補充，實感棘手。</p>
<p>徹底粉碎渝美甚地</p>
<p>又渝美空軍自於中國喪失其第一綫基地後，即作後退，現正努力整備其第二綫基地。然日空軍對其第二棧基地之桂林及丹竹諸基地，亦以迅速之手段，反復加以轟炸。沿京漢與粵漢綫至少三四百公里以內，渝美空軍基地，已悉置於日空軍之威脅下。因之中國海岸之渝美軍，已蟄伏無聲。際此日軍追迫駐渝美空軍，退入第三綫昆明·重慶·一帶內地之時，其空軍人員及飛機之損失　重，似已陷於窮境·由此美國於渝方之威信，亦將喪失，其結果必促使渝方之反省，茲日機隊芷期澈底粉碎渝美空軍，繼續果敢進攻中。</p>
<p>連江北岸正激戰中</p>
<p>用斯本十七日中央社電　據重慶電，渝方卞六日夜發表戰况如次：　湖南戰錢日軍，十三日夜猛攻衡陽南郊外廓，一部遂突入衡陽市街。日軍十四日正午得輕重各種裝備大部隊之增援，即於是夜對衡陽全綫包圍，同時發動猛攻。渝軍守備部隊，當以砲兵及步兵抵抗，激戰終夜未停。日軍復於十五日以野砲轟擊衡陽市街，日步兵都隊，即在野砲掩護下，强襲該市外廓之全陣地，尤以對西南部外廓陣地之攻擊最為猛烈。　廣東戰綫日軍，於粵漢綫西側北進，渡過連江·嚴江·支遊，刻在該江北岸地區，與渝軍激戰中·淸遠西方亦有戰事。</p>
<h3>渝美空軍　反攻失敗原因　使用飛機準備不足</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地十七日中央社電　中國戰綫之渝美空軍殲滅戰，自四月十二日日機轟炸遂川機塲以來，逐漸激烈化。其後兩月間，日軍航空部隊冒惡劣天氣，粉碎渝美空軍之强烈反攻。同時策應陸戰之進展，更對渝美軍加以重壓。計於此期間，擊落及擊毀渝美機，及其被炸中彈起炸者共計五百五十餘架。又自渝美空軍之衡陽基地失陷後，渝美空軍對日軍之重歷，更作殊死抵抗，竟轟炸日本本土九州。然渝美機之空襲企圖早為日軍所預知，早採取迎敵措置，故美軍此舉，終歸完全失敗。查其失敗最大之原因，即其使用P一〇八型機為時過早，此與德軍之使用V一號流星炸彈慎重態度，能獲舉光輝戰果相較，即可證明。觀美軍之B29型機，不但其預備補充不足，即其燃斜亦然。如此情形，即作空襲九州之舉失敗，自屬當然。</p>

<h3>東部戰綫　夏季攻勢重點</h3>
<p>當此英美軍侵入歐洲大陸，德國驚人新兵器出現，全世界的視聽集中於西方戰綫的時候，東方戰綫的德蘇開戰紀念日，又悄然來臨。三年前的六月二十二日，希特勒決意調遣德軍精銳，以排山倒海之勢，進攻蘇聯，迄今已至第四年。東綫第四年的夏季，其動向如何？按之蘇聯現在的態度，可分二方向：</p>
<p>第一種見解，以為蘇聯將充分利用德國應付兩個正面作戰之機，必在東部主戰綫，展開大攻勢。芬蘭方面的攻勢，不過是大攻勢開始前，去除北方陣碍物的小規模作戰而已。</p>
<p>第二種見解，以為史丹林將保守冷靜的自主的現實政策，使德英的衝突日增，兩者飭疲力盡時，乃一舉而克恢東部失地。</p>
<p>德方的見解</p>
<p>但德國有力方面均信前說可靠。蘇軍於五月上旬以來，在東部全戰綫，準備大攻勢，確屬事實。因為蘇聯不僅以恢復失地為滿足，例如，假定西　英美軍遂步迫近德國國境，彼時蘇聯絕不以恢復失地為已足，夢想最後勝利的英美蘇三國間，對於所謂戰後德國的處分問題，亦即戰後歐洲的最大問題，尚懸而未決，故任何一國的軍隊，倘最先開入柏林，殆爲決定戰後發言　的重要因素。</p>
<p>蘇聯現在掌握着攻擊的主導權，靜觀北法登陸戰的推移，自然居於最有利的立塲，不過此種靜觀，亦自有限度，倘右德軍將英美軍悉數驅出西歐時，德軍必返向東部，從事殲滅蘇軍；反之，英美軍倘眞的在西歐立定脚跟，開始壓迫德軍之時，英美蘇三國間將起競爭，所以無論在那種塲合，都不容許蘇聯靜觀。故西歐登陸戰至某一時期時，蘇聯必將展開大攻勢。此一時期；專視登陸戰的推移而定，德國預備軍傾全力開到西歐時，蘇聯將抓住此一時機不放，自不待言。至於此一時期，有明係瑟堡陷落之後，有謂巴黎附近的法蘭西平原展開決戰之時，凡此據國方面當然早有準備。</p>
<p>攻勢的地點</p>
<p>說到蘇聯發動攻勢，其地點在何處？查蘇軍現在在長約二千公里的全部戰綫，配置攻勢兵力，而以下列四個重點，駐紮主力部隊，待機而動。</p>
<p>第一，自北部戰綫的浦斯柯夫·奧斯特洛夫地區起，進　里加的兵團。</p>
<p>第二，在維特勃斯克，高梅里地里地區的白俄羅斯兵團。</p>
<p>第三，自羅維諾，泰爾諾波里地區起，正面迎對倫堡（即勒伏夫）的兵</p>
<p>第四，自南部雅斯伊，基西奈夫地區起，進窺羅馬尼亞的兵團。</p>
<p>要之，蘇聯的的夏季攻勢，無處不可展開·但德方所最警戒的是，史丹林將看準西歐戰局，一舉而求決戰，企圖突破中央戰綫，亦即破明斯克至倫倍克一綫，而打入波蘭平原。蘇聯軍在該地區集中的兵力，較他處尤為雄厚。德空軍也極活躍，在維特勃斯克東南方鐵道交叉點及高梅里率站等，對於中央戰綫後方的蘇聯集結部隊兵站部隊，加以猛烈轟炸，以阻止蘇軍的活動。（譯自六月二十三日日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>奪回克恩南高地德精銳予敵重創　柯坦汀南部美軍進展極微</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：克恩之西南，英軍經陸上砲隊及其主力　上之大砲數小時之準備後，於星期六晚向埃斯圭（Esquay）之東北一一二號山上之德軍高陣地與隣近各地區發動攻勢，敵艦探照燈光芒四射，照　戰塲以便利英軍之任務，因此塲地之輸廓嚴約可辨，但英軍並未想到德守軍亦能利用戰地之照顧，而明白可見進攻之英坦克車與步兵編隊，在數小時之激戰中，敵向一一二號山之猛攻，均被擊潰而受里大死傷，但德軍未能阻止敵軍自側面攻擊而竄入，因此英軍得以暫時抵達埃斯圭之北郊。但在該處遭遇德後備隊極强之反抗，英猛攻軍分隊大部份在該區被殲滅，同時其殘部則不得不四出逃逸，德自動武器與若干重溜彈砲隊追擊在逃之英軍，星期日淸晨英軍攻勢區之全部戰塲，重入德軍之手</p>
<p>喧傳努力徒勞無功</p>
<p>同時英第二軍靜已久，大機敵正在準備大規模之進攻，目的在於突破德軍陣綫，而推進至奧納河之外。英軍利用擴香器從事宣傳，誘使德軍叛離，但此種努力勞而無功，一如其以飛機向德軍陣錢投擲傳單之同樣無效。在美第一軍所守之地區，美軍亦在整頓其部隊，故預料此處亦將有大規模之新攻勢。</p>
<p>浪費砲彈得不償失</p>
<p>德軍向萊賽特塞甫綫（Lessay—des—sesves）之脫離行動未受敵之阻擾，而拉羅塞列（La　Roserie）地方則已為英軍所得。美軍於二十四小時內，在案洛一帶開放重型與中型之砲彈四萬五千發，並在萊饗聖日爾曼塞埃（Lessay—St　Germainesur　Aya）區開放大小砲彈三萬發，美軍雖耗費若是其多之子彈，但結果仍無重要進展。</p>
<p>犯罪戰法詭計多端</p>
<p>在桑洛　東之聖比爾特塞米萊（StPierre　de　Semily）附近，美軍引用一種犯罪之新戰法，敵兵若干名手執紅十字旗幟，並携昦狀冒充救護人員，向德軍陣綫前進，但當其行近德軍陣地時，突然向德軍</p>

<h3>美鋼鐵生產量　戰後已銳減　罷工乃爲最大之原因</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電據華盛頓電，美國因工潮及勞力不足，故鋼鐵生產不能達成預期之目的。據路透社消息，鋼鐵生產之最大障礙，即為　生之非法罷工，故為謀增產，首須解決罷工及勞力問題。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　美國鋼鐵生產額，觀一九三九年銑鐵量佔世界之百分之三十，鋼塊佔百分之三十六，而居世界各國之冠，是年第二次大戰爆發後，為　固軍需工業之基礎，更積極發展鋼鐵工業，尤其自一九四一年末，大東亞戰爭勃發，美國愈努力增產鋼鐵，一九四三年七月一日迄今日止　塊之生產力，已達九千八十七萬七千餘噸，由於冶鐵能力擴大，故煉鋼工作效率亦隨之向上，一九四二年一月至九月其煉鋼工作之效率，每月平均已達百分之九十八，徵諸以上種種，可知美國鋼鐵生產已達頂點（原料部門及其障礙），</p>
<p>鐵礦石</p>
<p>美國鐵礦之埋藏量，推定約有百零九億五千三百萬噸，佔世界　埋藏量之百分之一七點九。按美洲各國之埋藏量，合計有二百六十八億八千六百萬噸，合全世界之百分之四十六，一九三九年美國鐵之生產額，為七千二百萬英噸，占世界的生產額之百分之三六點五，一九四〇年已增至七千三百八十萬英噸，即打破過去七千三百二萬八千英噸之紀錄。一九三九年美國鐵礦埋藏地為明尼蘇達，威斯康星，密機安等三州，尤以蘇必利爾湖地方之產量最大，占國內總生產量之百分之八十三點七，含鐵量為百分之五二，乃屬最上等之赤鐵鑛，如上所述，原料鐵鑛石乃為鋼鐵業之基礎，此點美國尤大多能自足，冶鐵工塲則多在東北部各州，故鐵鑛石之運輸遭受甚大限制。按如欲運輸蘇必利爾湖地方之鐵礦湖上距離爲十五百海里，　後於伊利湖岸登陸後，尚須經百六十六里之鐵路蓮輸始能到達消費地彼茲堡，因此，湖上運輸乃生最大之障碍，美國自戰爭勃發以後，即慶止由湖上運輸米糧，而傾全力於鐵之運輸。</p>
<p>銅錳礦</p>
<p>此種礦質爲殊硫剝，亦為特殊鋼之原料，故為現代製鋼業所不可缺之原料，美國因銅　不足，復因需要量之增加，故形成出產與需要問過於縣殊之惡劣情况，按其國內生產，於一九四〇年時，僅不過四萬央噸，當時幾全部依賴輸入，自大東亞戰爭勃發後，由於輸入困難，故來源己告斷絕。</p>
<p>焦炭</p>
<p>爲獲　鐵之源料，焦炭之原料則為　靑炭，目前因焦炭生產力遲鈍，故需給方面極　圓滑，此亦未美國銀鐵增產之一大陣碍。</p>
<p>屑鐡</p>
<p>爲美國鋼原料，其重要性當凌駕、鑛之上，目前因急謀增產鋼鐵，故屑鐵之需要亦隨之增加，然　鐵之供給量有限，尤以自一九四一年規定屑鐵最高價格後，其來源益减少。又製造屑鐵之工業地帶與冶鐵中心地，並不一致，太平洋岸及加爾夫地方屑鐵之運費亦不一致，一九四三年之層鐵收回目標，其自家收回者為二七一九萬二千噸，購入者為一四三八萬六千噸，計共達四一五七萬八千噸，故欲行大量保存層鐵當極困難。</p>
<h3>渝方缺乏物資　丞需美國援助</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　渝財政部長孔祥熙，十六日會見美聯社記者，申述重慶之窘狀稱，羅斯福總統曾謂重慶之局勢嚴重，然此勿寗謂之為危險。由於日軍先於中國佔有地步，此不僅于渝方，即對美國亦為一種危險。然欲令士兵赤手空拳從事戰爭，此實為不可能。名謂美國為世界之兵工廠，則應援助渝方，渝方之五萬美元借款，尚餘其半數以上，此借款之主要自標，未在現金而為物資。渝方之通貨膨脹，非假因于紙幣，乃由于物資缺乏，物價高漲與物資之不足，賞能喪失戰意。倘　使渝軍繼續戰爭，則以援助物資，加强渝方為先決條件。蓋絲亳無物資時，事當上辦不到，是故物資乃渝方與通貨膨脈鬥爭，及與日軍交戰之武器，在遝輸問題，自有辦法解決。</p>
<h3>泰錫銻礦　將大量開採</h3>
<p>盤谷十七日中央社電　由農業國積極向工業國途上　進之泰國，根據地質調查之結果，探知地下埋有近代戰中重要軍需資源之錫鎢銻礦，今後行將大量採掘，以供軍需，據客幾政府調查稱：此等礦物之埋藏範圍，橫亘於八縣，三千平方公里，現正調查所採掘之礦石，對於錫鎢等礦區，已開始採掘，不久即將開採銅　等礦。</p>
<h3>瑞典中立　保持不變</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：瑞典外長古恩特昨日演講稱，瑞典之中立政策，雖未得各中立國之一般認可，但數年來已漸獲尊重，在彼等交戰國中，中立國自不受歡迎，國外之批評自然隨利害而轉移，瑞典政府之目標，仍在保存瑞典之自由及和平，如瑞典能維待中立至戰事終了，則將盡其可能以協助因兵　而荒廢之國家。</p>
<h3>東綫北路　蘇軍擴大攻勢　南路德軍作有力反攻</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，昨日蘇軍於獲得來復槍師團增援部隊後，向東綫北部擴大其攻勢。普里貝特河上游·泰諾波爾之西及魯資克之西，敵有強大之坦克車隊為之支援，而其目的顯欲儘速向勒伏甫（又名林堡）實行突破德軍陣地，但復獲挫敗。德反坦克車砲二日來於此戰區貢襲德軍由受敵壓力極大之數處據點稱後撤，俾能將敵軍侵入處堵合。</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍雖於十五日增調坦克車與步兵編隊，但該日結果蘇軍在東綫南路仍未能達到目的。强大之總坦克車部隊在泰諾波爾參加作戰，並在有力之反攻中，堵合前一日所被突破之缺口一處。魯資克之西南，蘇以步槍隊九師團賽繼進攻，但仍被擊退，魯資克之西，敵以一團之兵力進攻數次，均不得逞。奈門河區戰事更見緊張，德軍由格羅據諾（在舊波境內，鄰近立陶宛及東普魯士）實一進至奈門河西岸。</p>
<h3>必阿克島血戰錄</h3>
<p>荒島碧血</p>
<p>四月廿二日在新幾內亞霍蘭第亞登陸的敵軍，其後陸續增强兵力，西南太平洋的風雲頓形緊設。果然，延至五月廿七日晨，於猛烈的艦砲射擊與數十架的飛機掩護之下，敵軍開始以大部隊在必阿克島的南岸朴斯內克附近上陸</p>
<p>敵軍以水陸兩用戰車領先，用舟艇數十隻滿載上陸部隊進迫海岸。早已察覺的該島日守軍，抑住胸中如燃的憤激，誘其近岸。一待敵軍靠岸，日軍即從海岸陣地一齊向敵猛轟。得到大機動部隊的掩護而自信殊深的敵軍水陸兩用戰車，傲然前輩，受到日軍邀擊時，首先覆滅，隨在後面的舟艇部　，損害也很重大。在適當完，幾朝後倖登陸的戰車，看到後續部隊全被擊退時，慌退回海中，抱頭鼠竄。</p>
<p>遭受日守軍意外强烈的反攻以後，敵軍同日復以海軍艦艇接近海岸，列陣進攻，開如猛烈的近距離射擊。同時，在必阿克島南方阿胡島上獲得基地的敵空軍，亦呼應艦艇的攻擊，連續猛炸日軍陣地。得海空軍支援的敵上陸軍，於是再用生力軍進犯自朴斯內克至其西方十一公里的莫克梅爾一帶海岸綫。朴斯內克海岸附近的日軍，集結主力於有利於攻擊敵軍的後方高地，向已在海岸綫獲得立足點而企圖進犯該島中央的上陸部隊連夜展開日軍拿手傑作的夜襲戰，攔截敵軍，千以大打擊。但在敵軍戰車的衝擊，體砲的猛轟及飛機的轟炸之下，日軍也傷亡續出，將碧血染紅了必阿克烏。</p>
<p>密林焦土</p>
<p>一方面，據守莫克梅爾西方洞窟的日軍，於附近激擊在瓦洛伊上陸後以戰車裝甲車導西進的敵軍，輿主力呼應，展開壯烈的反攻，暫時將敵軍圈限於南岸地區。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰中最激烈的凡爾登戰役，據戰史上說，曾使附近的山河為之改形。今日，敵軍在登陸必阿克島以後的第二日，對於奠克梅爾附近的日軍陣地，其空軍在一天中投下的炸彈竟達三百噸之多，再加上體砲的猛烈掩護砲火，其情况之凄慘，比諸凡爾登一役，實無遜色。在這砲彈如雨之下，熱帶密林瞬息化為烏有，僅剩下一片焦土，滿目安凉，可是，敵軍雖然不惜工本，傾倒如許火藥鋼鐵，日軍却亳無懼色，屹然不動。在困難的境遇中，在連續的苦戰下，更發揮出無比的精悍，木着鋼鐵似的意志，以血肉之　勇敢地突擊敵軍，加以強擊。</p>
<p>視死如歸</p>
<p>看吧，日軍將士如歸的意氣！</p>
<p>敵軍上陸以後的第四日，即五月二十八日，在莫克梅爾附近的戰鬥中，橫山大尉所率的一中隊日軍，突然遭過敵力的戰車羣。它們猛然吐火，隊長橫山大尉首先中彈陣亡，其餘也有不少人負傷。島山舉曹和高橋兵長咬牙切齒地罵了一聲「媽的」·趕緊伏在道旁。這時，敵軍戰車隆隆地面來，並不住地吐出一速串的彈丸。風山和高橋二勇土，突然匍匐前進，偷偷接近戰車。說時遲那時快，昌山軍曹倏的立起身來，挾着炸彈，向敵軍戰車無限軌道的下方撲去。轟隆一聲，戰車炸翻了身，吐出熊熊的火焰。高橋兵長比島山曹長遲了幾秒鐘，也依樣覺葫產地向第三輛戰車猛撲過云，發出了一聲聲耳欲襲的爆炸聲後，這輛戰車也不能行駛了，並且還冒出一陣濃烟。抱着炸彈與敵軍戰車同歸於盡的這兩位勇士，其行動是如何悲壯呀！就是鬼神見了，也得退避三舍吧。</p>
<p>在日軍將士這種如火似茶的鬥志前，殘餘的敵軍戰車慌不迭地紛紛退去。敵軍是喪瞻了</p>
<p>夜襲大捷</p>
<p>在必阿克島這樣的苦戰惡鬥中，二十九日夜半，佐藤中尉帶領了一隊弟兄，果敢襲擊朴斯內克北方敵軍築路部隊的營幕，戰滅敵兵約四十名，鹵獲火焰放射器等多數戰利品，樹下炳輝的戰功。此外，某中尉也於黑夜率領所部小隊奇襲朴斯內克附近的敵軍，敵兵於倉皇中不知所措，被日軍一陣　殺，紛紛作島獻敵，遺下屍首一百五十具，武器，彈藥，食糧等無算。在赤道的荒島上，在衆寡縣殊的逆境中，日軍將士一點不曾氣餒，始終保持旺盛的戰意，發揮大無長的精神。（譯自七月二日購實報知）</p>

<h3>回憶戰的工塲</h3>
<p>— 吉美警正</p>
<p>近來每天早晨一到七點鍾，就在東京都戶　警察署的前面，有從東北動員來的四五十名女學生，整隊而過。從警察署附近的宿舍，先生率領著這批學生，向工塲出發。都紥著白包頭布，雄糾糾唱著勞動歌，穿著整齊的制服，一　即　充滿著誠心熱忱。我向窗外一看，衷心佩服這種真誠表示。辛苦，辛苦！請堅持到底！還有疼愛女兒的母親們，從遙遠的偏僻地方來到熱鬧的東京都市，看到此種大無畏的自我犧牲精神，不禁熱淚迸流。</p>
<p>但這批女學生服務的工塲，今日究竟怎樣呢？警察署長兼産業動員總部部長的我，於是就跑到自己管下的數十個公司和工塲去。</p>
<p>上班比率</p>
<p>在我管區內所有工塲，女學生今日的上班比例多少？毫無阻礙，生　　大概提高了幾何？負責要員親自指揮，進行得如何？事務系統一絲不　的順利麽？這類問題，我都完全知道，我刹那間，聯想到這些工埸的早晨一點鐘。</p>
<p>所有工塲，都在上午七時舉行朝會。各組長檢點人員。因爲如不點名，則工塲全部的上班情形，以及當天的生産效率，就全不知道了。工塲主任整理一下組長的報告，就向公司總經理報告，同時也要向警察署的動員總部通知。</p>
<p>將近十點鐘的時候，管區各工塲就打電話來，警察署的職員就出來接電話，每天都是一　一律地說：“是○○製作所麽？今天怎樣？上班比例是百分之九十三麽？辛苦，辛苦！請努力幹！”全警察署職員對於工塲，都抱著極大的關心。</p>
<p>管區內有很多中小工塲，以前各個工塲都互有長短，很不容易增加生産。但近來怎樣呢？所有的工塲都工作得很好。固然還未達到盡善盡美的地步，但其中卻有極優秀的工塲。尤其職工，都很認真服務。縱有心術不佳的高級不良人員，也都被職工的勞動熱忱所感動。上班比率也都好起來了。近來稍微上了軌道，所以各工塲的總平均，業已造成百分之八十八的好成績。上至總經理，下至員工，再在一到七時半，則全體到塲。工塲中，充滿著爽快而熱誠的空氣。</p>
<p>但，如說其中絕無不良之徒，這也是遠心之論。凡曠工過多的職工，則由警察署派人調查，或召來加以審問。大部份曠工者，都非出於不得已，而是自私自利的好逸惡勞心作崇所致。他們認爲有利可圖的事情，即去參加　，而便放棄工塲的工作，這就是他們曠工的一般理由。</p>
<p>這種敗類份子，縱然天天到工塲裏，而也不認真作工，所以反來給其他人一種不好的影響。只要有利，他們立刻就跑到其他工塲去。有這樣職工的工塲，就是副經理之類的高級人員，並未能善自親身指揮工作。目前會有過下列的情事。</p>
<p>因爲有上班比率不好的工塲，我就去打聽經理，而說他指導不良。</p>
<p>他十分肯定地答覆我說：“不，絕無這樣事”。經理並不凖確地知道職工的上班情形。因此，我就把警察署制成的各個工塲的上班比率表給他看。</p>
<p>“誠然，是這樣的呀！”於是經理就看看我而　起頭來。</p>
<p>固然，有時副經理因爲太忙，而無暇顧及職工的日常事情，但應當分配好時間，到工塲去，親自探問職工的生活，常常加以勉勵，這樣公司和工塲才有好的上班比率和生産效率。所謂親自出馬指揮，我認爲也決不單是捲袖搓掌巡視一番的事。</p>
<p>工塲　家</p>
<p>我每月召集各工塲的負責人開座談會一次。地點是産業報國會館。全都是像在自己家裏一樣，毫無　諱地，開誠佈公，供獻增加生産的意見。</p>
<p>一方面，管區內各工塲共合爲七班，以組織推進隊。推進隊按班分開，而到他班的工塲去，檢查效率提高之方法，指摘生産上各種的毛病，以資加強生産。自然，是不妨礙他人工塲爲原則，而檢閱兩三小時即去，同時警察署也派一名警察官隨同前往。在座談會上，也要提出這個推進隊報告來的。有時候，如有適當人，則請來講演時局。這樣的座談會繼續過許多次時，前此相互排擠的各工塲負責人，也逐漸親熱起來。相互握手，大有奮鬥到底之慨。真是令人欣喜萬分的事。各工塲間的親密性加深時，則警察與工塲間，也非常親密了。一有事發生，則與警察商量，職工中，也有來商量問題的。</p>
<p>一般說來，我管區內的所有工塲，都進行得很順利。其中有我所最佩服的工塲，略摘而加以記出。</p>
<p>○○　錶股份有限公司的中島總經理，今年是七十五歲的年邁長者，但有老當益壯的精神，早晨准在七點十分前上班。該公司的生産效率非常大，而去年底曾有過這樣的事情。</p>
<p>“現在日本物價高漲得不能生活，是否可以增加一些津貼？”這是全體職員向公司的一個要求。於是中島總經理就說：</p>
<p>“話很對，大家希望也並非無理。我也想怎樣滿足大家的迫切要求，但諸位有一件事情請加以攷慮。這並不是一件特殊的事情。我認爲前此公司內冗費太多。今後將汰除冗費，所儉省下來的錢，可以全部當作諸位的津貼，大家享受。”</p>
<p>於是所有職工都起而響應總經理的話。甚至很小的鉛筆頭也要使用，紙頭的反而也要寫字的。結果，冗費一個月會省下三個圓來。公司而又提出兩千圓，一共五千圓當作職工的家族津貼，這是一件多麽有意義的事呵！</p>
<p>我認爲上至經理，下至職工，都必須全體有愛護工塲的精神。使職工都要發生不願離開工塲的情緒，同時必須爲工塲任勞任怨。</p>
<p>一心一德</p>
<p>另外一方面，事務人員也應當必須認真。○○照像機股份有限公司，早晨事務員和工人一同上班，下午五時後，事務員跑到工塲去幫助工人各種雜事。工作如工人完事後的整理，或掃除等，此類工作完畢後即歸家。只有這樣作，工人才能肯拼命地幹。</p>
<p>近來工人非常忙碌，甚至理髮的時間都沒有。因爲工作完畢後，理髮店早已打烊了。於是我管區內的理髮匠會經商討，議決全體到工人宿舍去服務。這說是服務也可以，慰勞也可以。從鄉間來的工人，都非常的高興。在工塲裏因爲有事，就是剪髪也不能安心。但工作完畢回到宿舍，吃完飯後，在無事消遣時，開始剪髪，真有像在家庭裏的感覺。工人受到溫暖的家庭愛。所以其中甚至有流著感激的熱淚，而說“謝謝！”理髮匠也很感動地說：“請努力幹！”</p>
<p>“自從到宿舍去剪髪後，我們真覺著這是服務，所以非常高興”這話是理髮匠看見我去參觀時話的。我一看到這種情形，就想盡量幫助工人。就是根據這種心理，而利用休息日去年和前年曾組織過兩次業餘劇團。當開始表演時，工人們會從工塲裏推選出演員來幫忙。這因爲是愛護自己的工塲，所以收穫到很好的結果。</p>
<p>因此工人才能在工場內向敵人英美實行突擊。從下午四時，就是突擊時間。進軍號一吹時，大家都紥著白包頭布。直至五時的這一鐘頭，大家都振奮起一天疲倦的身體，而用全力作工。從學校跑去服務，這一突擊時間完畢後的我的女兒，非常感動地說，“我願在那個工塲作工！”</p>
<p>我認爲工塲裏也必須充滿著真正日本人的精神。經理，守衛，工人，事務員等，全都一心一德，努力增加生産，必須建立真正覺醒的　　服務的日本人工塲。（李寧自四月三十日號週刊每日）</p>

<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討　行政機構的活用</h3>
<p>第四，運營供出制時，與其採用鄉鎮長中心主義，不如採用保甲長中心主義。鄉鎮長裏面，歹徒很多。因爲他們被敵匪目爲“漢奸”，所以普通的老百姓，大多不願意當鄉鎮長。於是常被無賴不良之徒所佔。當然，在清鄉工作之下，也有善良的模範鄉鎮長，但在收費方面，應該避免濫用，要用鄉鎮長以上的人。保甲長比較是部落的居住者，大多是關心該村情形的農民，因此，希望貫徹保甲長中心的收買對策，確立商號與保甲長，及與其居民的正常提攜。</p>
<p>第五，對行政機關的協力收買，應由國府及米統會支出協力費用</p>
<p>收買靠各商號的單獨努力是不可能的。一切關係機關加以指導與協助是絕對必要的。行政機關側面的協助費。而其支出亦並不是形式上的給縣長的獎勵金，應確切　何人是最協力供出收買者，同時，行政機關本身絕代理收買，應嚴予根的。</p>
<p>第六，供出定額以保甲爲單位，由保甲長按比例分定各農家的數量，並酌量耕作面積及家族人數而決定之。如以前對自耕農以上者從寬，對貧農階級則從嚴的不公平定額，應予消除。</p>
<p>當規定比額時，應以保甲的耕作畝數，及其人口爲基準。耕作畝數的報告，極不正確，而有各種弊　，雖時有所　，但以畝爲單位而定額，其本身就成爲不公平的原因。例如，這裏有耕種土地七畝的佃農與耕地十五畝的自耕農。對此，如果一律規定每畝多少，顯然是不公平的。應從收穫量中減去農家自用量的差額，是爲供出額。所以最好在規定比額時貧農最少，中農，地主，不在地主應較多。比額公平化的實現，不單是技術額應公平化，勿使農民呻吟於過重的負擔下。</p>
<p>第七，供出價格與市價的相差所贊成的農民損失，用　價配給必需物資以爲保　。物資配給不能迅即實施時，須付給供出獎勵金，勿使農民負擔大損失。</p>
<p>今後收買價格，如何決定，雖尚不明，但價格相差的問題，除非全面的採用照市價收買的方針，終必發生。交換物資的配給，固然必要，但如遲不實行，則其效果亦將減半。其配給應在收買最盛期實施。假使這難於實行，則對供出者必須速即採用獎勵金制度。</p>
<p>第八，爲實現收買簡單化，迅速化起見，將特用及民用的收買加以區別，特用由米統會負責，民用米原則上用自由收買的方式，並使行政機關執行各地民食米對策。</p>
<p>這方法如上海內地各方面都會主張，爲求其實現起見，特用米應在初期收買完竣。如以前米統會的工作，擬遲延至青黃不接期，這在確保特用米上，不單是障　，而且助長民用米前途的不安，使發生更深刻的米糧問題。</p>
<p>綜上所述，行政收買制在全面的革新方針下，今後仍可繼續採用。（譯自六月二十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>防空待避所　建造要領　待避所的大小</h3>
<p>待避所的大小問題，因爲是短時間的事情，祇要家族能夠都進得去，縱局促一點也不要緊，一般地說，有一米平方的大小，足供坐的大人四人，伏的二人避難。</p>
<p>一個待避所收容了過多的人數以後，萬一被直擊彈等命中而受到損害的場合，影響極大，故每個待避所的規模儘求其小，收容多人的待避所，希望分散建造。</p>
<h3>高樓建築物的場合</h3>
<p>在水泥鋼骨建築物中的事務所，那建築物本身就有相當的防彈效力，所以其房間立即可利用之爲待避所。不過一般地從最上層起的第二層房間，或在底層而接近外壁的房間，或靠近地面並鄰近建築物的屋頂而接近扶梯外壁的房間，或面向狹小中庭的房間，或特別大的房間等；與別房間比較起來，不甚安全，所以在可能範圍內應盡量避免，第二層以上的樓面（上述最上層起的第一二層除外），而不向外面地方，例如走廊中，或　層而不靠外壁的房間，使用起來特別安全。</p>
<p>假使因種種情形而將一二樓的全體房間使用爲待避所時，窗及出入口容易被炸彈破壞，彈片和　風侵入，玻璃飛散，所以窗前應堆起砂袋土　至一人高，在出入口設防護壁，從這些開口部造起不使彈片　風侵入的防護設備。</p>

<h3>印度聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 高見順</p>
<p>我在仰光的期問，我會讀過一本介紹印度的書，羅巴特。拜倫着的「印度隨筆」，其中論列着着很多印度的複雜性。結論上會說，印度本來就是統一最困難的國家，許多原因中的一個，使是地形的關係。詩人的觀察，是很有意義的。拜倫曾經普遍地旅行過印度，印度的廣裹平原，視綫內茫茫的曠野，在外形上看是毫無變化的。「印度風景，是缺少色彩和形體的。所以劃一性幾乎全是帶恐怖性的。」是這樣的無變化，反峽這　單調劃一的地形，當然社會方面和政治方面也不能有統一情形。拜倫就是這樣說過的。自然本身是絕端果調和統一的國家，其居民反不願過統一的生活。印度人間各方面的分裂性，都說道是自然發生的。</p>
<p>英國的分化統治政策，是用不着再加　舌的世人皆知的事。這種卓著的污名狼藉政策，英人拜倫想用地政學的觀點保自圖其說。就是在這一點上讀他的文章，意義也很有趣</p>
<p>分化統治政策中最好的一個例證，就是印度的驚人藩王國的數目。現在我們略加介紹其梗槪，參加藩王會羅，且各有議席的撲有人口六千萬以上的藩王一國，爲一〇八；　有人口八百萬以上，派十二名代表參加藩王會議者，爲一二七個二法藩王國。另外小王候國有三二七（按一九三一年調查）。</p>
<p>英國這樣在直轄地裹，按排下如許的藩王國數目，而是阻撓印度的統，亦即預防反革運動的統一。此外用分配藩王的待遇來建立藩王問的磨擦和傾軋。愚　的藩王，因對英國忠實，則盡量改善其待遇。——這就是英國人工所製造出來的印度政治複雜性。</p>
<p>至於印度的「名產」印度敎徒與同敎徒的摩擦，是不爲大家所周知的事，而用不着再加詞費的。但，我在仰光碰到了上位印度人會慨嘆說，這是英國侵八印度徒，才成爲「名產」的。</p>
<p>在仰光住着差不多印度所有的種族，而種族間多半都是分區營居的，即縱爲同一的貝拿勒斯人，也要分成絕對不同的印度敎貝　勒斯人區與　敎貝　勒斯人區。甚至飯館菜店，印徒敎徒與囘敎徒也有各自不同的出入地。任何小的　火食物　，囘敎　也都經常　。所以凡是單純收容回敎徒客人的地方，則門前掛着星與月的囘敎　，以防印度敎徒的闖入。印度敎徒對於同一孟加拉人所經營的商店，只要回敎孟加拉人所經營，則絕對不會去照　的。</p>
<p>宗敎的複雜性不止於此。印度敎徒的風俗習慣，還有更複雜而奇怪者。例如僕役和　役，二者是身份不同的。廚役的身份是比僕役還低賤的職業。所以在仰光時我們會經　用印度　役，由於戰爭非常劇烈，於是就命令廚役同時兼作僕役的事，但怎麼都不成。因此又命令僕役作廚役的事，這也同樣遭受了嚴州格拒絕。身份高的人作身份低的工作，則有傷神規定的身份之尊該，所以是絕均「不可能」的。身份低者不作身份高者的工作，也同樣是按神的意旨工作的。關於身份，我並不是一無常識，而是實際上願曉得。這　是一個非常奇怪的國家。所請謂常識，就是談到印度人，也要知這有阿利安系，蒙高確要系，德拉雜　系等許多種族。鮑斯是阿利安系的印度人。泰戈爾，拉馬克利剎那，維威加南等著名人物，多屬於阿利安系。著名的內伊德渥女士，是　高爾系。</p>
<p>但實際一來研究，並不如此簡單。縱令同一阿利安系的印度人，如果是孟加拉省人，則說孟加拉省話，如果是旁遮普省人，則說旁遮普省人，格加拉第人則說格加拉第話，而相互間言語不通。嚴格說來，他們相互間都認對方為「外國人」。</p>
<p>一九四二年十二月八日，在仰光會經行過好多事情，而其中之一，就是印度人大會。在廣塲上，會召集了一個印度獨立聯盟的講演會。在緬甸的印度各種代表，各界名士等，都會會熱烈地起來爭辯，認爲爲多年的宿願，印度的獨立與解放時期，業巳迫近。但塔米兩省人（德拉維達系）演說時，懂得塔米爾語者，只有廣塲上印度人中的塔米爾省人，其他大部份印度人，是一點也不明白。於是就用英文　譯出來，讓聽衆聽，但這也不過是讓一部份懂得英文的印度人　而已。於是為使　僅英文的回敎徒印度人聽，則又翻譯成囘敎徒官話的渥爾德語，但　樣印度敎徒就不　，所以又必須　譯成印度斯坦語。這真是一件麻煩事。</p>
<p>印度的複雜性，充分表現於這一會塲上，當道樣複雜的演說終結時，則開始進行示威遊行。我站在街頭的一角上，看着這樣的一字長蛇陣，心中非常感動，看吧！犬獠世仇的　敎徒和印度敎徒，不是在親善和陸地携着于麼？</p>
<p>請再看吧！身份低者豈不是也和身份高者的僧侶，一同遊行麼？真那故和的孟買的巨商富賈，也鄉貧窮的塔米爾省的苦力一起，參加遊行示威。使印度人造成中世紀那樣種族分裂者，是英國人。現在這種桎梏業已粉碎了。在印度獨立的大目標下，所有的印度人都拋　畛域之見，而團結起來了。在這個十二月八日的示威遊行中所看到的團結，不久後即結成印度國民軍的煌果　。</p>
<p>而國民軍業已邁進印度。印度業已揚棄了英國那樣宣傳的印度複雜性，而看到印度人團結的姿態了。印度的獨立，就會摧毀英國的　辣支配，而解放印度，同時也會因畸形的複雜性中解放出印度人來。（季譯自四月二十三日週刋每日）</p>

<h3>取締黃金黑市</h3>
<p>頻年以來金價上升不止，究其原因，區爲年來時局之影響所致。不過黃金上升，尤易刺激物價高漲。因之，本市當局會一再設法使金價趨於平定，無奈一般投機份子，不明大義，陽奉陰遠，掀風作浪，抬高黃金價格，以飽私慾；而泰平中民，亦未能體念時艱，始終利慾薰心，大量搜藏，藉此保障財產價值。須知一民圖利萬民爭購，能不使金價扶搖直上。而刺激物價，擾人損己，羣心惶惶，有終日不安之勢。若長此以往，其後息何堪設想！吾人除深感遺憾以外，惟盼當局，迅予措置適當辦法，實爲刻不容緩也。茲將近三年來黃金價格之動盪，略述梗槪如下：</p>
<p>憶自前年二月間至五月間，黃金一千兀（以每一兩爲單位）絡續躍至一千八百元。至六月中旬，因更替老新法幣，其間曾一躍而至老法幣四千元，同月十七日一律改用新法幣，黃金亦以二折一由四千元改爲二千元。因此新老法幣雖以一對二折合算，而黃金價格却從容不迫完，至年底已扣三千元大關矣！</p>
<p>嗣以去年二月間金價由三千兀挺升至五千元，當局會勒令，裘天實·老鳳祥，新鳳祥·方九霞等四大銀樓停業。而其他各大銀樓，亦立即自動停業。雖一再請求復業，當局因事關安定金融，非詳加考慮今後適當措置不可。會延遲至四月二十一日始准復業，並規定市塲交易不得超越五千元之限價。故時達二月，金價平靜如恆。迨至七月問一般投機份子又起蠢動，在初因際於當局之嚴萬措置，未敢藐視法令，不曾擅越限價。無如日久玩生，重　風浪，會逼近一萬元大關。後因棉布收買，謠傳餘音或有波及黃金，故灣至八千元關口之後，當局措覺適當，半年之問，黃金始終站定萬關以丙，物價亦無甚軒桎，民心安定，實為一承平之時期也。</p>
<p>迨至本年一月底至二月中旬，餘波重掀，金價扶搖直上，由一萬元　升至一萬四千元。直至二月下旬，中央儲務銀行，際於黃金上漲，關係金融安定，故將庫存之一少部份，黃金數萬兩，派給銀樓傾售。同時以一萬一千五百元之低價，儘量出售。可知財政常局，體恤民艱，以謀抑平物價，一時會消弭黃金上漲。無如爲日不多，即行停止派售，致前功盡葉，爲之嘆惋不已</p>
<p>銀樓方面自中央儲備銀行停止黃金派售，同時亦停止營業。直至三月十一日，始由當局實行黃金配給制，酌量提高售價爲一萬五千元。三月底曾一度跌至一萬三千元。四月問略爲回上一萬四千元左右。至五月初尚在一萬四千元之間徘徊，不料在此一月之內，逐日上漲百元，故至五月底已為一萬八千七百元。六月中旬已出二萬大關，至六月下旬逐日又上升至二萬七千三百元。尤以木月間漲風爲冊熾，已至三萬七千五百化。長此狂升不已，實有影　整個金融安定也。</p>
<p>查近數月來黃金漲風之起起，實爲配給市塲未臻健全。蓋本市各銀樓逐日派員長社駐市塲，聽取行市，視店中需要量，按日購進，暢需無阻。詎料爲時不久，一般外埠銀樓，亦紛向滬埠登記配給，於理尚無不合之處。但有不良份子，乘機藉外埠銀樓各義，將配給所得，以高價售與黑市，謀飽個人之私囊。致本中各銀樓配數平均减少，尤足影響門市營業，無法應付顧客，而顧客不得不轉向墨市求進。以致里市應抬愈高，而當局配給價亦追隨黑市而提高，形成無日不漲之勢。</p>
<p>由於黃金上漲，刺激物價，至深且鉅。故深盼；並立即停止外埠配給。以上二點：實為當務之急也。</p>
<h3>股市變動與上海經濟的前途</h3>
<p>— 張詩洲</p>
<p>今年自入春以來，百物均漲，獨有股市一　不振，竟節節下降，多數小額股票一致跌八票面甚鉅，約低五成之譜，較佳者亦時在票面徘徊，各幫大戶復時施拋空故按，努力　壓市價，是以熱門股冷門股　同吿不支狂　。小投資階級大都嚇得魂飛天外，股票號本身亦多擱淺淸理，此一時期爲證交復業以後最惡性的時期，各方對於股市幾皆有談虎色變之概。外界對於股市印象之惡劣可想而知。</p>
<p>迨股市惡性發展，使當局密切注目後，中儲當局方秉承上峯意旨，於七月十日起宜佈重辦華股押款，市塲上並盛傳當局將設立華股平準會，以維持股價正常發發展，消息傳來，人心大奮，十二日起股市遂呈露從未有的新氣象</p>
<p>證券市塲向爲容納游資最佳的去處。據有關方面調查，本市游資運用於貨物投機上者不下千萬薦元，這一筆無孔不入的游資平時本已爲害不淺，再加上從股市退出的巨額資金，怎敎近半年來黃金不大漲，物價不暴騰？升斗小民簡直受害匪淺，中上階級亦感仔肩漸重。因此如要想把上海目下動盪不定中的經濟從風浪中安定下來，除了誘導游資重新復歸股票市塲，使民生，實業兩方面立刻並受其益之外還有何法呢？政府實應速籌具體專策，以爲對付。</p>
<p>股市不振的原因約可分述如下。過去因為謠言孔多，而且銀根緊迫，故股市人心虛弱萬分，一聞風聲鶴淚，即行盲目拋售，心理恐慌異常。再加廣幫，紗花幫，銀行幫大戶間有少　份子乘機拋空，市上　增許多空頭現碼，價格能不急　下降？尤其是銀行幫常利用客戶押款之質物向股市作大規模的拋空，　壓市價，從中漁利，危害整個經濟最為可恨。希望中儲金融檢查　在可能範圍內加以檢舉或勸吿，用　刁風　　　尤，則股業前途幸甚。</p>
<p>本屆長期跌風過程中，大型股小型股一共平均跌去百分之五十，責任雖大半在於拋空投機者身上，但各該小型股的公司企業本身不健全實亦不能辭某咎，濫行增資，使股　　碼大量增加，當然要發生惡性泛濫了。此後希望各公司企業　問確屬不　全者，亟應仿華成實業公司　監議決辦法照票面將股票酌量收回，去年度未發紅利股息者一律發給股東以優厚利息以維信用，同時實力派大戶亦一力予以維持，投資者興趣旣被引回，股市保可鋒鋩大現，游資的大量吸收當然不生問題的了。此外並希望有關當局和中儲督促有加，努力上海新經濟市塲的建立。物價旣可下降，民困亦可漸蘇矣。</p>

<p>豪爽的湯淺中尉，不管別人高興與否，而把　人與隆夫拖到客廳來，把隆夫讓到　位上，給大家介紹了一下。「呵，這就可以了。請喝一杯酒吧！」隆夫以爲湯淺中尉是一個直爽的人。又介紹出來的新田少尉，是目光燜燜，而肩闊腰圓的魁偉者。另外一個原少尉，是像真人一樣的溫和沉默家。這兩個人看着一都和眞人有交情，實行親熱的注目禮後，就開始談天了。</p>
<p>在飯桌上擺列着兩三個湯酒壺。似乎在這種塲面上，湯淺中尉是一個主角。</p>
<p>「老谷，你還是不喝酒麼？我本來規定星期六喝酒，但上一個星期和大上一個星期，全都破例了。今天晚上好好都沒有這樣痛快過了。喂，新田，喝好了麼？」</p>
<p>湯淺中尉很愉快地這樣喊呌着。「還沒有·還沒有，」這樣說着，而搖擺手。新田少尉的聲音，侮破　一樣，隆大不想禁笑了。</p>
<p>「新田，明天我將帶道個人到潛水學校去參觀，恰巧星期天，真對不起，請多國照！」</p>
<p>眞人好像事前準備好了話，方才說出來。先前所說的治水學校的朋友，似乎就是新田少尉。該少尉似乎是爲聽講某種課程去的。</p>
<p>「好。」</p>
<p>新出少尉的破　聲音，只一個字。</p>
<p>隆夫聽到海軍軍人這種用字法，在板上又映現出在橫須賀訪問五十鈴號軍艦的士官次官的神情。不，此次比那時的霧圍氣，更加快活，更加爽快。隆夫處在這樣霧團氣中，眞覺着有無上光榮。於是則不能不使隆天過去去壓在潛意識中的海軍士官宿願，又復活起來。</p>
<p>「你既置海軍書，那末就耍知道我們的暗語。」</p>
<p>湯淺中尉說得很對。</p>
<p>「呵，一定……」</p>
<p>「例如在軍艦上的人稱「早安」爲「早」。尤其對長官說話的時候，更要按海軍的話來說，否則就要挨罵的。」</p>
<p>「哈哈！真簡單化了。」</p>
<p>「是的。但這句話你該不明白了吧！「克帕」是什歷意思？」</p>
<p>「是令愛。令愛不是道特兒麼？銅是Copper，如按古音就是令愛。」</p>
<p>隆夫捧腹大笑。毫無意義，完全　中學生一樣，製造暗語。——（一一九）</p>

<h3>Improving Prison Hygiene</h3>
<p>The late Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, died of typhus. It is said that the cause of his illness was being infected by lice from prisoners while inspecting the prisoner ward of the Masnan Road Detention Center in this city. Therefore, strictly speaking, Zhang's death was not due to old age, but to the unsanitary conditions of the prison. It is also reasonable to say that. Moreover, Mr. Zhang, with the dignity of a minister, personally went to the prison for on-site inspections. His purpose was nothing more than to improve prison facilities, improve prisoner treatment, and improve prison hygiene. Improving prisoner treatment was exactly what Mr. Zhang planned to improve. Unfortunately, the plan to improve prison hygiene had not yet been realized, and the person who decided on the plan died as a result. We cannot help but mourn for Mr. Zhang. At the same time, we are even more saddened by the future of prison hygiene improvement.</p>
<p>We are certain that when Mr. Zhang took office as Minister of Judicial Administration, he actively paid attention to prisoner treatment, such as striving to increase prisoner rations, raising funds for prisoner medical expenses, and making every effort to solicit donations from all parties to purchase medicines needed by prisoners. These two matters further demonstrate that Mr. Zhang's personal visit to the prison was undoubtedly to inspect prison hygiene and then decide on an improvement plan. Therefore, we hope that in the future, the judicial authorities will first of all quickly plan improvements to prison hygiene. Not only will prisoners benefit universally, but it will also live up to Mr. Zhang's will and comfort Mr. Zhang's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>The Masnan Road Detention Center in this city is better than general prisons in terms of internal housing facilities, etc., but prisoners are repeatedly ill. It is also heard that the warden is currently suffering from typhus. From this, it can be seen that prisons in other places with even simpler facilities are even more likely to cause disease. For the sake of overall prison hygiene and protecting the lives of prisoners, it is even more necessary to plan improvements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The purpose of sentencing is not to punish criminals, but to discipline them and hope that they will improve their character. As a result of the improvement, they will become good members of society in the future. Therefore, imprisoning criminals, working hard on their energy, and tempering their will are all appropriate things to do. If the prison is dirty, without regard to cleanliness; if diseases arise, without regard to dispensing medicine; and if prisoners are left to live or die on their own, it is truly a living hell, which is neither permitted by law nor in line with the right path. Based on the principle of improving prison hygiene, we offer a few humble suggestions:</p>
<p>Diligence and labor are the primary duty of every prisoner. For the cleanliness of the prison, prison management personnel should strictly urge prisoners to handle it themselves. According to general assumptions, no matter how simple the prison is and no matter how tight the funds are, sweeping and cleaning should not be abandoned because of this. Moreover, cleanliness is not a luxury, but comes from hard work. After cleaning, it directly reduces the chance of disease transmission and indirectly reduces medical expenses. We hope that the judicial administrative authorities will formulate specific measures and instruct all prison personnel to implement them conscientiously.</p>
<p>Local health authorities should provide special guidance on prison health facilities and liaise with prison management personnel to conduct regular inspections and guidance in the promotion of public health. Medical procedures such as vaccinating against smallpox, injecting vaccinations, and disinfection should be implemented universally in prisons. We hope that the judicial authorities and the health authorities will agree on specific measures and implement them at any time.</p>
<p>Establish prisoner hospitals and clinics, depending on the size of the prison and the number of prisoners, and set them up in the prison. The Ministry of Judicial Administration should raise funds, and if necessary, solicit donations from the public.</p>
<p>Hygiene facilities in prisons, such as bathing places and toilets, should be universally set up, and all cleaning matters should be handled by prisoners.</p>
<p>Although prisoners are detained in detention centers for a relatively short time, attention should also be paid to hygiene. Otherwise, prisoners awaiting trial or those who are innocently implicated are extremely likely to contract diseases once they enter prison. If they are not sentenced to death, they will die nine times out of ten if they have strong resistance. Individual health will be ruined, and public medical care will be wasted.</p>
<p>In short, prison hygiene is not an ideal that is difficult to achieve. As long as the methods are appropriate and the management is strict, it will definitely gradually take effect. We hope that the judicial authorities will actively plan for it.</p>
<h3>Change of Japanese Naval Minister: General Nomura Takes New Post, General Shimada Focuses on Important Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 17th: Naval Minister Shigetaro Shimada's resignation was approved, and the successor is Navy General Naokuni Nomura, who held the inauguration ceremony at 5 p.m. on the 17th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the current major war situation, the Japanese government has conducted various reviews on how to concentrate all-out efforts to win. This time, it was decided to change the Naval Minister, and General Naokuni Nomura, commander of the Kure Naval District, will succeed him. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo presented the memorial to the palace at 2 p.m. on the 17th, and the inauguration ceremony was held at 5 p.m. with Prime Minister Tojo standing by. It has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Naval Minister Nomura</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Naval Minister Nomura is from Kagoshima Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in November of the 40th year of Meiji (33rd year of Guangxu). In the 8th year of Taisho (8th year of the Republic of China), he was appointed as a Navy Major and also served as a naval attache in Germany for one year. After returning to China in the 13th year, he was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel. In January of the 14th year, he was appointed as commander of the submarine fleet. In the 3rd year of Showa (17th year of the Republic of China), he was promoted to Colonel and served as captain of the Chogei warship. In the 4th year (18th year of the Republic of China), he served as a military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Germany. After returning to China in September of the 6th year (20th year of the Republic of China), he served as captain of the Haguro warship. In the 8th year (22nd year of the Republic of China), he served as captain of the Kaga warship. At the end of the same year, he served as the principal of the Submarine School. In the 9th year (23rd year of the Republic of China), he was promoted to Rear Admiral and served as commander of the Submarine Squadron. In the 10th year (24th year of the Republic of China), he served as Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet.

<p>Remarks by Director Matsushima</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) - Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently gave a speech on the occasion of Navy General Naokuni Nomura's assumption of office as Naval Minister, clarifying its significance. Colonel Matsushima said: "This time, Navy General Naokuni Nomura personally assumed the office of Naval Minister, so General Shimada, who previously held the dual positions of Naval Minister and Chief of the Naval General Staff, can focus on the important task of carrying out military orders, and the traditional spirit of the Navy, which clearly separates military orders and military administration into two things, has returned. In the past six months, General Shimada, who held two positions, can be relieved of half of his duties, and General Nomura can take on the position of Naval Minister full-time. This is a measure to maximize the effectiveness of naval operations in the current major war situation, and it will have significant implications for the future war situation."</p>
<h3>Navy General Nakamura Discusses the East Asian War Situation: Japan Already Occupies a Geographical Advantage</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Navy General Ryozo Nakamura recently published an article titled "The East Asian War Situation Has Reached a Decisive Stage" in the July issue of "Pacific Magazine," in which he discussed the European and East Asian wars in detail. His discussion of the East Asian war situation is as follows: According to King's statement, the strength of the US fleet is 20 battleships, so all six of the North Carolina class are in service, and it seems that two of the Iowa class have also set sail. It is rumored that three old battleships have been deployed on the Western Front, and the remaining 17 ships, except for those that have been repeatedly sunk by the Japanese army, are all deployed in the South Pacific. It is rumored that six Essex-class aircraft carriers are in service, and five more seem to have entered the water, or will appear on the front line in the near future. Nine Independence-class aircraft carriers are in service. In addition, it seems that there are ships with an unknown number being refitted. Although it is not clear whether some of the aircraft carriers will be deployed in the Pacific, all of the formal or cruiser-converted ships are sailing in the Pacific, and their total number seems to have reached more than 40. In addition to the US fleet, there is also the British fleet in the Indian Ocean, which also has several aircraft carriers. The United States is also planning to build an aircraft carrier formation with a displacement of 45,000 tons, but it will take some time for them to appear on this front line. Although the details of the auxiliary vessels are still unclear, most of the 31 pre-war cruisers and 54 under construction have been put into service as a result of the emergency manufacturing plan after the Pearl Harbor attack. If we look at the map, we can understand that the line connecting the western end of New Guinea, from the Japanese mainland through the Izu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Mariana Islands, Yap Island, Palau Island, and Togobe, is the main line of Japan's defense of the Pacific. In the north, Minami-torishima Island and Oshima Island can be used as forward bases. In other parts, it is extremely difficult to form a line of defense due to the single-line relationship. In the enemy's breakthrough operation, it is inevitable that the enemy will invade the Mariana Islands, successively press on Saipan and Rota Island, attempt to form a Pacific base group, control the surrounding sea and air, ensure the safety of the rear, and attempt to break into China or carry out feint operations to invade the Ogasawara Islands and conduct air raids on the Japanese mainland. For these auxiliary operations, the enemy will never use up all its strength and abandon its main purpose. Once Saipan is captured, the southern end of the defense line will be affected, and it may also allow the MacArthur army to advance from Biak Island and establish a unified coordination of north-south steps. The Pacific theater can be moved to the China Sea. Although we cannot know Japan's highest countermeasures against the enemy at this point, judging from the geographical advantages alone, its victory is undoubtedly on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Guilin Begins Evacuation of Population</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities, fearing that the Japanese army on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts will advance towards Guilin, have ordered the citizens of Guilin to evacuate and have ordered that all industrial facilities be moved to the interior as much as possible. Essential facilities that cannot be moved should be destroyed. According to a report from an Associated Press correspondent, the situation in Liuzhou, a key southern street in Guilin, is that Liuzhou is an important transportation hub in Guangxi. The Liuzhou military authorities have issued an evacuation order to the citizens, stating that it is to prevent the danger of air raids and attacks by parachute troops, but the actual reason is still fear of attacks by Japanese parachute troops. The evacuation began on July 17, starting with women and children, followed by key civil servants, and then the general public. Only the army and volunteer army remained in the city.</p>
<h3>National Government Initiates Grand Canal Dredging Plan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The National Government, in order to repair the Grand Canal, has been actively preparing, and as a result, decided that the entire project is scheduled to be completed in five years and began on April 1 of this year. It is currently underway. It is learned that the first phase of the project, from Taierzhuang on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces to Guazhou on the Yangtze River, is scheduled to be completed in November. When the project is completed, the Zi River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Tai Lake can be interconnected, and one-quarter of the total length of the Grand Canal will be unblocked. The coast of this section is the most densely populated and resource-rich area. The opening of the canal is expected to increase the production and transportation of war resources. The development of the National Government in all aspects of politics and economy will also be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Central Party Headquarters held its 210th Memorial Week on the 17th, attended by more than 600 people. Secretary-General Minyi presided over the meeting, and Zhou Weiyuan and Xueyuan reported on "Food and Price Issues."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The National Government held a weekly meeting on the 17th, with all civil servants and military personnel participating. Chief Civil Servant Xu presided over the meeting and reported on the rule of law.</p>
<h3>Hankou Establishes Rice Purchase Office</h3>
<p>Hankou, 17th (Central News Agency) - After the establishment of the Hankou Rice Evaluation and Purchase Office, the office was set up in the city's Chamber of Commerce and officially started work yesterday. The office will soon launch new policies and has decided to first set up six rice collection and purchase offices in four suburban areas to facilitate purchase work.</p>
<h3>Focus of National Government's Budget for the Second Half of the Year is Military Spending, Totaling About the Same as the First Half</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held a regular meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), attended by Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo, who explained in detail the National Government's budget for the second half of the year, the recent gold buying and selling, the Shanghai stock market, and the universal collection of special consumption taxes. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Budget Issues) The budget for the second half of the 33rd year should have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation, but the actual needs have increased and prices have risen, so the budget has also increased accordingly. It needs to be discussed with all relevant parties. Minister Zhou is scheduled to return to Beijing today to continue consultations with all parties, and a decision can be made. The focus of this budget is on military spending and improving the treatment of civil servants. The budget figures have not yet been formally determined, but the total amount is about more than double that of the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Gold Speculation</p>
<p>(Gold Buying and Selling) The National Government has not yet completely controlled gold, so it only intends to formulate temporary measures to crack down on gold buying and selling. Newspapers have repeatedly reported on this point. Recently, the price of gold in Shanghai suddenly surged, so the Ministry of Finance recently announced measures to crack down on it, which is actually a targeted countermeasure. The Ministry of Finance originally prohibited using gold as collateral, but some unscrupulous firms in Shanghai disobeyed the order. Now the Ministry of Finance has ordered the China Preparatory Financial Bureau to investigate and check the accounts of these firms. Although the results of the investigation have not yet been submitted to the Ministry, the Ministry is aware that several banks have engaged in this illegal activity. Some of these firms have already been punished by the Ministry of Finance, but because the official report has not yet arrived, their names will not be announced. Since the start of the inspection work, the price of gold has fallen, but other reasons for the rise in the price of gold are the lack of materials, which is also an unavoidable fact.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Manipulate the Stock Market</p>
<p>(Stock Market) Since January of this year, the stock market has been declining and has not risen. The legitimate reason for this is that various factories lack materials, power is reduced, and production is reduced, which causes stocks to fall. However, there are also stocks that should not have fallen but did fall, which is related to the unscrupulous firms that manipulate gold trading. These firms use stocks as a powerful speculative force to manipulate the stock market and try their best to make stocks fall. The accounts of these firms have stocks as collateral, and because the stock price falls below the collateral amount, the firms are forced to redeem their accounts. Those who are unable to redeem their accounts, the firms have the right to dispose of the collateral to guarantee their legitimate interests, and the stocks fall into the hands of the firms. Many similar situations have occurred, so the stocks are manipulated by speculators. This kind of mutual cause-and-effect relationship has made the stock market plummet. Recently, because Shanghai has been checking the accounts of various firms, the stock market has slightly improved.</p>
<p>(Universal Collection of Special Consumption Taxes) The collection of this tax was initially stipulated for 15 cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two municipal districts of Nanjing and Shanghai. The results have been good so far. Since May 16, the tax has been universally collected in all three provinces and two cities. It is estimated to be 120 million yuan per month. Wuhan is also hoping to start collecting the tax, and the Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing it.</p>
<p>Currency Has Not Inflated</p>
<p>(Issuance of Central Reserve Bank Currency) In order to meet the needs, the Central Reserve Bank authorities issued 500-yuan notes at the request of the Shanghai Banking Association. Will the results affect currency inflation and price increases? Let's discuss this separately. First, the occurrence of currency inflation depends on whether the revenue and expenditure of finance are balanced and the supply and demand of social finance. Since the National Government returned to the capital, finance has followed the principle of balancing income and expenditure and prioritizing key areas, so there has never been a deficit, so there is no phenomenon of currency inflation. Secondly, the current demand for social finance is still far from the saturation point, so it will not affect price increases. This is because the Central Reserve Bank and the central financial authorities have repeatedly and carefully studied the issuance of 500-yuan notes and decided to issue them only after ensuring that there will be no impact. Although all banks in the world have reserves, they are all moving towards the legal currency system. The Central Reserve Bank has reserves of more than 60%, which is more than most banks in other countries. Now that banks in various countries are moving towards the legal currency system, various countries will have appropriate handling methods after the end of the war. At that time, our country can also refer to them, so there is no need to worry about increasing currency issuance.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency) - The price of rice in this county once soared, but recently, due to the absorption of Shanghai merchants, it has risen again. First-class machine-milled white rice is 3,800 yuan, second-class is 3,400 yuan, and top-quality rice is sold for 3,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Civil Servants Who Pass the Higher Civil Service Examination Receive Original Salary During Training</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The authorities specially submitted this year's temporary higher civil service examination to the National Government, and instructed all agencies to pay civil servants who pass this year's higher civil service examination their original salary during the training period.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Committee Delineates Purchase Areas in Central China and Implements a Deposit System</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Flour and Wheat Committee of the Business Integration Council has been promoting the "Provisional Measures for the Purchase of Flour and Wheat" and the "Provisional Measures for the Manufacturing and Processing of Flour and Wheat" since they were formulated last year to promote the purchase of wheat and the manufacture of flour. In order to promote the work more smoothly, it has been decided to implement a deposit system for wheat and flour factories in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The deposit is stipulated to be 30,000 yuan for wheat shops and 50,000 yuan for flour factories. In addition, in order to avoid friction between regions and to increase the purchase as much as possible, purchase areas have been delineated in various wheat-producing areas in Central China. The delineated purchase areas are recorded below: Shanghai Area: The entire area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, from the customs and railway line to Huangdu, Shanghai, Baoshan, Pudong, Jiading, and Chongming. Suzhou Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Anting to Kunshan, through Suzhou to Wangting, Wujiang, Dachang, Changshu, and Qingpu. Wuxi Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Zhoujinggang to Wuxi, through Shitangwan to Luoshe, Jiangyin, and the northern area. Changshu Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Henglin, through Qiyi Weir to Yixing. Nanjing Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Louzhenshan to Nanjing, and along the Tianjin-Pukou line from Pukou to Puzhen, Jurong, Shenshui, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, and Donggezhen. Zhenjiang Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Danyang, through Zhenjiang to Longtan, Jintan, and Rongyang. Wuhu Area: Along the Nanjing-Wuhu line from Caishi, through Wuhu to Wanzhi. Also, the Huainan line Guangzhou and Digang, Tongling, and Hexian. Bengbu Area: Along the Tianjin-Pukou line from Huaqiying, through Chuxian, Luodian, Mingguang, Linhuaiguan, to Bengbu along the upper reaches of the Huai River. Yangzhou Area: From Yangzhou, through Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Sishui, to the Grand Canal, including the Xinghua, Huxi, Tianchang, and Yiwei areas. Taixian Area: Taixian and Jiangyan, Dongtai, Mengcheng, and Nantong. Anqing Area: The area from Datong to Anqing along the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Launch Offensive and Interception Operations in June with Great Results: Over 1,400 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 17th: The combined results of the offensive and interception operations carried out by the Japanese Army and Navy against enemy aircraft in June are as follows: Damage inflicted on the enemy: In northern Kyushu, 7 B-24 aircraft were shot down and 29 B-29 aircraft were destroyed. In the South Pacific, 165 aircraft were shot down, 125 aircraft were destroyed and damaged. In the Central Pacific, more than 897 aircraft were shot down and 40 aircraft were destroyed. In China, 81 aircraft were shot down and 110 aircraft were destroyed and damaged (including 1 B-29 aircraft). In Burma, 24 aircraft were shot down and 7 aircraft were destroyed. In the North Pacific, 1 aircraft was destroyed. Total: more than 1,460 aircraft (including 11 B-29 aircraft). Japanese losses: 342 aircraft did not return to base after self-destruction, and 27 aircraft were damaged on land. Total: 369 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Success of Japanese Surprise Attack on Myitkyina Airfield; Marshal Terauchi Sends Congratulatory Telegram; Encourages Japanese Air Force to Continue Efforts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Burmese Front Lines, 17th: The Japanese air force successfully launched a surprise attack on the Myitkyina airfield, a base for airborne troops in northern Burma, destroying 39 P40 fighters and Douglas transport aircraft. Upon hearing of this glorious victory, Marshal Terauchi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Area Army, sent a telegram of congratulations, encouraging them to continue their efforts. This surprise attack was launched during heavy rain. Upon arriving over the western side of the enemy airfield's runway, 23 P40 fighters and Douglas transport aircraft were found parked side by side on the ground. As soon as the squadron leader gave the order, all aircraft suddenly dove down, and upon releasing the first bombs, the fierce P40 aircraft were completely shattered, and black fuel spread across the ground. The entire airfield was engulfed in fierce fire and smoke.</p>
<p>Ledo Road Will Be Unusable</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th: The Ledo Road, which replaces the Burma Road, can be said to be the lifeline of the Chongqing regime. Its construction is currently receiving assistance from American technicians, who are working hard on its construction. According to intelligence from the area on the 14th, American technicians and Chinese laborers are working hard on the construction of the Ledo Road, regardless of the weather. However, the work is difficult, and due to continuous rain since June 4th, the water level is several feet deep, forcing the construction to stop. If Japan exerts further pressure, the road will become unusable.</p>
<p>Difficulty Replenishing Chongqing-American Troops</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: According to a dispatch from Kunming, the Chongqing-American forces operating in northern Burma are attempting to replenish their troops after suffering heavy blows from intense Japanese bombing. The Chongqing military decided on the 15th to send an educational corps currently undergoing training in Guiyang to replenish one of the major divisions of the country, and they arrived in Kunming on the 14th, awaiting air transport. Recently, the second and third divisions will also arrive in Kunming. It is ultimately proving difficult to replenish losses with troops transported by air, so the Chongqing side is finding troop replenishment truly challenging.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Destroy Chongqing-American Bases</p>
<p>Furthermore, after losing their front-line bases in China, the Chongqing-American air force retreated and is now working hard to prepare their second-line bases. However, the Japanese air force is also repeatedly bombing their second-line bases in Guilin and Danzhu with swift attacks. Within at least three to four hundred kilometers along the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou lines, the Chongqing-American air force bases have all been placed under the threat of the Japanese air force. As a result, the Chongqing-American forces on the Chinese coast have become silent and inactive. As the Japanese military is pursuing the Chongqing-based American air force, forcing them to retreat into the inland areas around Kunming and Chongqing, the losses of their air force personnel and aircraft are heavy, and they seem to be in dire straits. As a result, America's prestige in the Chongqing region will also be lost, which will inevitably lead to the Chongqing side reflecting on their situation. The Japanese air force aims to thoroughly destroy the Chongqing-American air force, continuing its bold attacks.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of the Lian River</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 17th: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing side released the following battle situation on the evening of the 16th: The Japanese army on the Hunan front launched a fierce attack on the outer defenses south of Hengyang on the night of the 13th, and a portion of the troops broke into the streets of Hengyang. At noon on the 14th, the Japanese army received reinforcements of large units with various types of light and heavy equipment, and on the same night, they completely encircled Hengyang and launched a fierce attack simultaneously. The Chongqing defending troops resisted with artillery and infantry, and the fierce fighting continued throughout the night without stopping. On the 15th, the Japanese army again bombarded the streets of Hengyang with field artillery, and Japanese infantry units, under the cover of field artillery, strongly attacked the entire defensive positions outside the city, with the attack on the southwestern outer defenses being particularly fierce. The Japanese army on the Guangdong front advanced north on the west side of the Guangdong-Hankou line, crossing the Lian River, Yan River, and their tributaries, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing army in the area on the north bank of the rivers. There is also fighting west of Qingyuan.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Failure of the Chongqing-American Air Force Counteroffensive; Insufficient Aircraft Preparation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Japanese Front-Line Base, 17th: The annihilation battle against the Chongqing-American air force on the China front has gradually intensified since the Japanese air force bombed the Suichuan airfield on April 12th. In the two months since then, the Japanese air force has braved severe weather to crush the strong counteroffensive of the Chongqing-American air force. At the same time, they supported the progress of land battles and placed further pressure on the Chongqing-American forces. During this period, a total of more than 550 Chongqing-American aircraft were shot down, destroyed, or detonated by bombing. Furthermore, since the fall of the Chongqing-American air force's Hengyang base, the Chongqing-American air force has put up a desperate resistance against the repeated attacks by the Japanese army, even bombing the Japanese mainland of Kyushu. However, the Japanese army had foreseen the Chongqing-American aircraft's attempt to raid them and had taken measures to counter them, so the American army's move ultimately ended in complete failure. The biggest reason for their failure was that they used the P-108 model aircraft too early. This can be demonstrated by comparing it to the German army's cautious approach to using the V-1 flying bomb, which resulted in brilliant battle achievements. Looking at the American army's B-29 aircraft, not only were their reserves and replacements insufficient, but so was their fuel. Under such circumstances, it was only natural that their attempt to raid Kyushu would fail.</p>

<h3>Eastern Front: Focus of Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>At a time when Anglo-American forces are invading the European continent, and Germany's astonishing new weapons have appeared, with the world's attention focused on the Western Front, the anniversary of the German-Soviet war on the Eastern Front has quietly arrived. Three years ago, on June 22nd, Hitler decided to deploy elite German troops to attack the Soviet Union with overwhelming force, and now it is the fourth year. What will be the trend of the fourth summer on the Eastern Front? Based on the Soviet Union's current attitude, it can be divided into two directions:</p>
<p>The first view is that the Soviet Union will fully exploit the opportunity of Germany facing two fronts and will launch a major offensive on the main Eastern Front. The offensive on the Finnish front is just a small-scale operation to remove obstacles in the north before the start of a major offensive.</p>
<p>The second view is that Stalin will pursue a conservative, calm, independent, and pragmatic policy to allow the conflict between Germany and Britain to intensify, and when both are exhausted, he will seize the opportunity to recover the lost territory in the East in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The German View</p>
<p>However, powerful German circles believe that the former view is reliable. It is indeed a fact that the Soviet army has been preparing a major offensive on the entire Eastern Front since early May. This is because the Soviet Union is not only satisfied with recovering its lost territory. For example, assuming that the Anglo-American forces gradually approach the German border, the Soviet Union would never be content with simply recovering its lost territory. The issue of the postwar treatment of Germany, which is the biggest problem in postwar Europe, is still unresolved among the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, who dream of final victory. Therefore, the army of any country that first enters Berlin is likely to be the decisive factor in the right to speak after the war.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union now holds the initiative in the attack, and naturally occupies the most advantageous position by watching the progress of the landing operation in northern France. However, this kind of observation is also limited. If the German army drives the Anglo-American forces out of Western Europe, the German army will return to the East to annihilate the Soviet army. Conversely, if the Anglo-American forces really gain a foothold in Western Europe and begin to put pressure on the German army, competition will arise among the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union is not allowed to observe quietly in any situation. Therefore, the Soviet Union will launch a major offensive at a certain stage of the Western European landing operation. This period depends entirely on the progress of the landing operation. When the German reserve forces are fully deployed to Western Europe, the Soviet Union will seize this opportunity, which goes without saying. As for this period, some say it will be after the fall of Cherbourg, and others say it will be when the decisive battle unfolds on the French plains near Paris. The German side is of course prepared for all of this.</p>
<p>Location of the Offensive</p>
<p>Speaking of where the Soviet Union will launch its offensive, the Soviet army is now deploying offensive forces on the entire front line of about 2,000 kilometers, and is stationing its main force in the following four key areas, waiting for an opportunity to move.</p>
<p>First, the corps advancing towards Riga from the Pskov-Ostrov area of the northern front.</p>
<p>Second, the Belarusian corps in the Vitebsk-Gomery area.</p>
<p>Third, the corps facing Lviv head-on from the Rovno-Ternopol area.</p>
<p>Fourth, the corps advancing on Romania from the Yassi-Kishinev area in the south.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union's summer offensive can be launched anywhere. However, what the German side is most wary of is that Stalin will seize the right moment in the Western European battle situation and seek a decisive battle in one fell swoop, attempting to break through the central front, that is, the line from Minsk to Lemberg, and enter the Polish plains. The Soviet army has concentrated more troops in this area than elsewhere. The German air force is also extremely active, and is conducting fierce bombings of Soviet concentration areas and troop stations behind the central front, such as the railway intersection southeast of Vitebsk and the Gomery station, in order to prevent the Soviet army's activities.

<h3>German Elite Troops Inflict Heavy Casualties on the Enemy in Recapturing Hill 112 Near Caen; Minimal Progress for American Troops in Southern Cotentin</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: German News Agency Report: Southwest of Caen, after hours of preparation by British land artillery and the main artillery of the , on Saturday evening, the British launched an offensive against the high German positions on Hill 112 northeast of Esquay and neighboring areas. Enemy warships shone searchlights, illuminating the battlefield to facilitate the British mission, so the contours of the battlefield were clearly visible. However, the British did not expect that the German defenders could also take advantage of the battlefield lighting, and the advancing British tank and infantry formations were clearly visible. In hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's fierce attacks on Hill 112 were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties. However, the German army failed to prevent the enemy from attacking from the flank and breaking in, so the British were able to temporarily reach the northern outskirts of Esquay. However, they encountered extremely strong resistance from German reserves there, and most of the British assault units were annihilated in that area, while the remnants had to flee in all directions. German automatic weapons and several heavy grenade artillery units pursued the fleeing British troops. By Sunday morning, the entire battlefield in the British offensive zone had returned to German hands.</p>
<p>Propaganda Efforts Prove Futile</p>
<p>At the same time, the British Second Army has been quiet for a long time, and a large-scale enemy is preparing a large-scale offensive, aiming to break through the German line and advance to the outside of the Orne River. The British army used loudspeakers to carry out propaganda, inducing German soldiers to defect, but this effort was futile, just like their throwing leaflets from airplanes into the German front. In the area held by the American First Army, the American army is also reorganizing its troops, so a new large-scale offensive is expected here as well.</p>
<p>Wasteful Shelling is Not Worth the Cost</p>
<p>The German army's disengagement operation towards the Lessay-des-sesves line was not hindered by the enemy, and the La Roserie area has been taken by the British army. Within 24 hours, the American army fired 45,000 heavy and medium shells in the area around Sanloh, and 30,000 shells of various sizes in the Lessay-St Germainesur Aya area. Although the American army expended so many bullets, the result was still no significant progress.</p>
<p>Treacherous War Tactics</p>
<p>Near StPierre de Semily, east of Sanloh, the American army used a new, criminal tactic. Several enemy soldiers carried red cross flags and posed as medical personnel with stretchers, advancing towards the German line. But when they approached the German position, they suddenly attacked the German army.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Active in the Skies Over Northern France</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: German military authorities explained the activity of the German Air Force on the 15th as follows: From midnight on the 14th to the morning of the 15th, British bomber squadrons made large-scale bombings of railway centers in northern France and the suburbs of Paris. German night fighter squadrons took off to meet them and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down several four-engine bombers and destroying several other aircraft. On the evening of the 14th, German bomber squadrons, in cooperation with fast bomber squadrons, bombed anti-axis ships anchored in the Seine Bay, hitting many targets. On the 15th, German bomber squadrons carried out carpet-bombing of anti-axis tank groups in the Caen area and the Carpiquet area, destroying several tanks.</p>
<h3>German Commander in Western Europe Expresses Determination to Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: Houtong News Agency: Marshal Kluge, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in Western Europe, told field reporter Zhang Bo: "We will continue to strike the invading European forces so that they will never forget it." Kluge, who previously served as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in the Central Sector of the Eastern Front, was injured, but the 62-year-old Marshal remains in extremely good health.</p>
<p>Steel Tempered in Fire</p>
<p>He said, "The time I have spent outside and the injuries I have suffered can be said to have set a new record. I have flown over the front line more than 2,000 times, have been shot down twice, and have had several car crashes. Once, I was rescued from a burning car. After the last injury, I participated in night raids from midnight to the morning of the 15th, when British bomber squadrons made large-scale bombings of railway centers in northern France and the suburbs of Paris. According to Jun's night battle team, they took off to meet the voices and engaged in fierce aerial combat, and fired and destroyed its four engine bomber. German bomber squadrons, in cooperation with fast bomber squadrons, bombed anti-axis ships anchored in the Seine Bay. Hit multiple bombs. On the 15th, the German bomber squadron carried out a carpet bombing of the anti-axis vehicle group in the Caen area. When the car was bombed, several vehicles were destroyed. Also exercise gymnastics, now it is extremely strong.</p>
<p>Skilled in Defeating the Enemy</p>
<p>Regarding the combat methods of General Eisenhower's army, he said: "Our opponents do not have an obvious spirit of fighting. The British, American, and Canadian armies must advance after their artillery and bombs have destroyed all obstacles. The enemy's operations take a safe approach and fight in Europe with absolute scientific methods. We use the knowledge of struggle to deal with this method, but military leaders cannot reduce their chances. We will use various countermeasures to deal with the enemy's less methods. At that time, the world will know the effectiveness of this measure."</p>
<p>Seize Opportunities</p>
<p>When a reporter asked whether "D-Day" had caused chaos in Western Europe, Kluge replied that we are now waiting for the enemy's new attack at any time, and we will strike it so that they will never forget it. He also expressed the hope that Europe's eight battles will be waged in a heroic manner. He was shocked when he stood in front of the half-destroyed Rouen Cathedral, which the German army had saved from the catastrophe in 1940. Regarding his subordinate Marshal Rommel, he said that Luo has extensive experience and worked with him in the 1940 Western European campaign.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Air Force Launches Fierce Attacks on Rouen</h3>

<h3>US Steel Production Sharply Reduced After the War: Strikes Are the Biggest Reason</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch from Washington) - Due to labor unrest and insufficient labor, the United States has not been able to achieve its expected steel production goals. According to Reuters, the biggest obstacle to steel production is the illegal strikes that have occurred. Therefore, to increase production, the first thing that must be resolved is the strike and labor problem.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Looking at the United States' steel production volume, the pig iron output in 1939 accounted for 30% of the world's total, and steel ingots accounted for 36%, ranking first among all countries in the world. After the outbreak of World War II in that year, in order to solidify the foundation of the military industry, it more actively developed the steel industry. Especially since the end of 1941, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the United States has been increasing steel production even more vigorously. From July 1, 1943, to the present, the production capacity of steel ingots has reached more than 98.77 million tons. Due to the expansion of iron smelting capacity, the efficiency of steelmaking has also increased accordingly. From January to September 1942, the average monthly efficiency of steelmaking reached 98%. From the above, it can be seen that the United States' steel production has reached its peak (raw materials sector and its obstacles).</p>
<p>Iron Ore</p>
<p>The estimated reserves of iron ore in the United States are approximately 10.953 billion tons, accounting for 17.9% of the world's reserves. According to the reserves of various American countries, the total is 26.886 billion tons, accounting for 46% of the world's total. In 1939, the production volume of iron in the United States was 72 million English tons, accounting for 36.5% of the world's production volume. In 1940, it had increased to 73.8 million English tons, breaking the previous record of 73.28 million English tons. In 1939, the iron ore reserves in the United States were in the three states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, especially the area of Lake Superior, which had the largest output, accounting for 83.7% of the country's total production. The iron content was 52%, which is the highest grade of hematite. As mentioned above, raw material iron ore is the foundation of the steel industry, and the United States is particularly self-sufficient in this regard. Most of the iron smelting plants are located in the northeastern states, so the transportation of iron ore is subject to considerable restrictions. For example, the distance for transporting iron ore from the Lake Superior area is 1,500 nautical miles on the lake. After landing on the shore of Lake Erie, it still needs to be transported by rail for 166 miles to reach the consumption site, Pittsburgh. Therefore, lake transportation is the biggest obstacle. Since the outbreak of the war, the United States has ceased transporting grain by lake and has devoted all its efforts to the transportation of iron.</p>
<p>Copper and Manganese Ore</p>
<p>This kind of mineral is particularly sulfur-free and is also a raw material for special steel, so it is an indispensable raw material for the modern steel industry. Due to the insufficient supply of copper in the United States and the increase in demand, a severe situation of excessive disparity between production and demand has formed. According to its domestic production, in 1940, it was only 40,000 English tons, and at that time, almost all of it relied on imports. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the difficulty of imports, the source has been cut off.</p>
<p>Coke</p>
<p>The raw material for obtaining iron is coking coal. Currently, the production capacity of coke is slow, so the supply and demand are extremely uncoordinated. This is also a major obstacle to the increase in silver and iron production in the United States.</p>
<p>Scrap Iron</p>
<p>As a raw material for American steel, its importance surpasses iron ore. Currently, due to the urgent need to increase steel production, the demand for scrap iron has also increased accordingly. However, the supply of scrap iron is limited. Especially since the establishment of the highest price for scrap iron in 1941, its source has further decreased. Moreover, the industrial areas for manufacturing scrap iron and the central locations for iron smelting are not consistent. The freight for scrap iron on the Pacific coast and the Gulf region is also inconsistent. The target for scrap iron recovery in 1943 was 27,192,000 tons recovered by oneself and 14,386,000 tons purchased, totaling 41,578,000 tons. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to carry out large-scale preservation of scrap iron.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Lacks Materials; Urgently Needs US Aid</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chongqing's Finance Minister, Dr. H.H. Kung, met with a reporter from the Associated Press on the 16th and stated Chongqing's difficult situation, saying that President Roosevelt had said that the situation in Chongqing was serious, but this should not be considered dangerous. Because the Japanese army has taken possession of land in China before, this is a danger not only to Chongqing but also to the United States. However, it is impossible to ask soldiers to wage war empty-handed. Since the United States is called the world's arsenal, it should aid Chongqing. More than half of Chongqing's US$500 million loan remains. The main target of this loan is not cash but materials. Chongqing's inflation is not caused by paper money but by a lack of materials. High prices and insufficient materials can lose the will to fight. If the Chongqing army is to continue the war, then aiding Chongqing with materials and strengthening Chongqing is a prerequisite. Because when there are no materials at all, things cannot be done. Therefore, materials are Chongqing's weapons in the struggle against inflation and in the battle against the Japanese army. As for the transportation problem, there is a way to solve it.</p>
<h3>Thai Tin and Antimony Mines to Be Extensively Mined</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thailand, which is actively advancing from an agricultural country to an industrial country, has discovered through geological surveys that the ground contains tin, tungsten, and antimony mines, which are important military resources in modern warfare. In the future, they will be extensively mined to meet military needs. According to a survey by the government, the range of these mineral deposits spans eight counties, covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Currently, the investigation of the mined ore is underway. The mining of tin, tungsten, and other mines has already begun, and the mining of copper and other mines will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Sweden's Neutrality Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Swedish Foreign Minister Günther stated in a speech yesterday that Sweden's policy of neutrality, although not generally recognized by various neutral countries, has gradually gained respect over the years. Among the belligerent countries, neutral countries are naturally not welcome, and foreign criticism naturally shifts with interests. The goal of the Swedish government remains to preserve Sweden's freedom and peace. If Sweden can maintain its neutrality until the end of the war, it will do its best to assist countries devastated by war.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Expands Offensive on Northern Section of Eastern Front; German Army Mounts Vigorous Counteroffensive on Southern Section</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday, after receiving reinforcements from rifle divisions, the Soviet army expanded its offensive on the northern section of the Eastern Front. Upstream of the Prypiat River, west of Ternopil, and west of Lutsk, the enemy was supported by powerful tank formations, and their purpose was clearly to quickly break through the German lines towards Lviv (also known as Lemberg). However, they were defeated. German anti-tank guns have been attacking in this war zone for two days. The German army withdrew from several positions under heavy enemy pressure in order to plug the places where the enemy had invaded.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Although the German army increased the deployment of tanks and infantry formations on the 15th, the Soviet army still failed to achieve its goal on the southern section of the Eastern Front that day. A powerful general tank force participated in the battle in Ternopil and, in a vigorous counteroffensive, plugged a gap that had been broken through the previous day. Southwest of Lutsk, the Soviets continued to attack with nine rifle divisions, but were still repelled. West of Lutsk, the enemy attacked several times with a regiment of troops, but were unsuccessful. The fighting in the Neman River area is even more intense. The German army advanced from Grodno (located within the old Polish border, near Lithuania and East Prussia) to the west bank of the Neman River.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle Record of Biak Island</h3>
<p>Bleeding on a Desert Island</p>
<p>The enemy forces that landed in Hollandia, New Guinea, on April 22nd have since gradually increased their strength, and the atmosphere in the southwestern Pacific has become tense. As expected, on the morning of May 27th, under the cover of intense naval gunfire and dozens of aircraft, the enemy began to land a large force near Bosnek on the south coast of Biak Island.</p>
<p>The enemy army led with amphibious tanks, using dozens of boats full of landing troops to approach the coast. The Japanese garrison on the island, who had long been aware of this, suppressed the burning anger in their hearts and lured them closer to the shore. Once the enemy army approached the shore, the Japanese army immediately bombarded the enemy from the coastal positions. The enemy amphibious tanks, which were confident due to the cover of the large mobile force, were arrogant and forward, and were the first to be destroyed when they were ambushed by the Japanese army. The boat troops following behind also suffered significant damage. After landing safely, a few of the tanks that landed saw that all the subsequent troops were repelled, panicked, and retreated back into the sea, fleeing in disarray.</p>
<p>After suffering an unexpectedly strong counterattack from the Japanese garrison, the enemy army approached the coast again on the same day with naval vessels, lined up in formation, and launched fierce close-range fire. At the same time, the enemy air force, which had obtained a base on Ahu Island south of Biak Island, also responded to the attacks of the naval vessels and continuously bombed the Japanese army's positions. With the support of the naval and air forces, the enemy landing forces then used fresh troops to invade the coastline from Bosnek to Mokmer, 11 kilometers to the west. The Japanese army near the Bosnek coast gathered its main force in the high ground behind, which was conducive to attacking the enemy army, and launched a night attack, a masterpiece of the Japanese army, against the landing troops who had gained a foothold on the coastline and attempted to invade the center of the island, intercepting the enemy army and inflicting heavy blows. However, under the impact of the enemy army's tanks, the fierce bombardment of the artillery, and the bombing of the aircraft, the Japanese army also suffered continuous casualties, and the blue blood stained Biak Island red.</p>
<p>Scorched Earth in a Dense Forest</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Japanese army, which was entrenched in caves west of Mokmer, fiercely attacked the enemy army that landed in Wardo and was advancing westward with tanks and armored vehicles, responding to the main force and launching a heroic counterattack, temporarily confining the enemy army to the southern coast area.</p>
<p>The Battle of Verdun, the fiercest battle in World War I, is said in the history of war to have changed the shape of the mountains and rivers in the vicinity. Today, on the second day after the enemy army landed on Biak Island, its air force dropped as many as 300 tons of bombs in one day on the Japanese army's positions near Mokmer. Coupled with the fierce covering fire of the artillery, the situation was more tragic than the Battle of Verdun. Under the rain of artillery shells, the tropical dense forest instantly turned into nothingness, leaving only a piece of scorched earth, full of desolation. However, although the enemy army spared no expense, pouring out so much gunpowder and steel, the Japanese army was not afraid at all and remained unmoved. In difficult circumstances, under continuous hard battles, they demonstrated unparalleled courage and used a steel-like will to bravely attack the enemy army with flesh and blood and inflict a strong blow.</p>
<p>Ready to Die</p>
<p>Look at the Japanese soldiers' spirit of readiness to die!</p>
<p>On May 28th, the fourth day after the enemy army landed, in the battle near Mokmer, a company of Japanese soldiers led by Captain Yokoyama suddenly encountered a strong enemy tank group. They suddenly spat fire, and Captain Yokoyama was the first to be hit and killed in action, and many others were injured. Sergeant Isayama and Private Takahashi cursed "Damn it" through gritted teeth and quickly lay down beside the road. At this time, enemy tanks rumbled over the ground, constantly spewing out a string of bullets. Sergeant Isayama and Private Takahashi suddenly crawled forward, secretly approaching the tanks. In the blink of an eye, Sergeant Isayama suddenly stood up, holding a bomb, and rushed towards the bottom of the enemy tank's track. With a loud bang, the tank flipped over, spitting out raging flames. Private Takahashi was a few seconds slower than Sergeant Isayama and also rushed towards the third tank in the same way, producing a series of ear-splitting explosions. After that, this tank could no longer move and was also emitting thick smoke. How tragic was the action of these two brave warriors who embraced bombs and perished together with the enemy tanks! Even ghosts and gods would have to retreat three times.</p>
<p>In the face of such a fiery fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers, the remaining enemy tanks retreated in a panic. The enemy army had lost its courage.</p>
<p>Great Victory in the Night Raid</p>
<p>In such a hard and fierce battle on Biak Island, on the night of the 29th, Lieutenant Sato led a team of brothers and boldly attacked the enemy army's road construction unit's encampment north of Bosnek, wiping out about 40 enemy soldiers and seizing many spoils, including flame throwers, establishing a glorious achievement. In addition, a certain lieutenant also led a small team of his subordinates to launch a surprise attack on the enemy army near Bosnek in the dark of night. The enemy soldiers were at a loss in a panic and were slaughtered by the Japanese army in a flurry of attacks, leaving behind 150 corpses, weapons, ammunition, food, and countless other supplies. On the desert island near the equator, in an adverse situation of vastly unequal strength, the Japanese soldiers were not discouraged at all, maintained a strong fighting spirit, and demonstrated a spirit of great fearlessness.

<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of Judicial Administration, unfortunately passed away on the 15th. Mr. Zhang made contributions to the country and society during his lifetime.

<p>A Brief Biography of Mr. Zhang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, from Wuxian, was born in the eleventh year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examination in the guiwei year of the nineteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu. In the thirtieth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, he went to Japan to study and graduated from Tokyo Hosei University. In the thirty-third year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, when Beijing was preparing for judicial independence, Mr. Zhang personally drafted the trial implementation regulations for the Beijing courts at all levels and then served as the first Chief Prosecutor of the Beijing Local Court. He was subsequently transferred to serve as the Chief Prosecutor of the Yunnan High Court. At the time of the Wuchang Uprising in the xinhai year, local gentry elected Mr. Zhang as the Yunnan representative. Without fearing danger, he rushed to Nanjing and participated in the revolution. During the first and second years of the Republic of China, the government established the Pingzheng Yuan and Suzheng Ting to improve governance. Mr. Zhang was appointed as the Presiding Judge of the Third Chamber of the Pingzheng Yuan, handling many important cases, especially the cases of Wang Zhi and Liu Zhizhong, officials convicted of banditry, both of whom were sentenced to death, shocking the government and the public. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Zhang was serving as the Vice Minister of Justice, the government recovered the Chinese Eastern Railway and specially appointed Mr. Zhang as the special envoy to prepare for the takeover. He was stationed in Harbin for a month and established the Eastern Special District Court and Prison. After resigning from his official position, Mr. Zhang practiced law in Shanghai and other places for nearly twenty years, redressing grievances and protecting human rights, which was highly regarded by society. During the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang witnessed the urgent need for lawyers in Shanghai society and did not hesitate to dedicate himself to serving the public interest. He was always fair, law-abiding, and meticulous in his work, and was especially respected by his colleagues. In the autumn of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang's elder brother, Zhongren, passed away in Sichuan. Mr. Zhang was deeply saddened by the brotherly love and wrote an elegy for his brother, with sincere and truthful words. At the beginning of this year, the central authorities valued Mr. Zhang's talent and knowledge and earnestly sought his service, appointing him as the Minister of Judicial Administration. Mr. Zhang initially declined due to old age, but ultimately, with the desire to reorganize the judiciary as his lifelong ambition, he resolutely stepped forward to accept the appointment, hoping to focus on it for half a year, carefully planning and gradually reorganizing, and personally inspected the judiciary in North China, traveling long distances without complaint. He also inspected prisons and personally entered the cells. Unfortunately, due to accumulated overwork, he fell ill in Beijing on July 5th, suffering from spotted fever, and passed away on the 15th at the age of seventy-three.</p>
<h3>During the Henan Campaign, Chongqing Soldiers Returned in Droves; Interview with Director Liu of the 24th Group Army</h3>
<p>General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Group Army of the National Government, after the tragic battle in the Taihang Mountains on May 6th of last year, with the full support of the Allied military authorities in North China, General Pang resolutely led his troops to comply with the order to return to civilian life and participate in transportation, sparing no effort in reorganizing and training his troops. Major General Liu Tianxing, Director of the Political Training Department of the army, recently came to Shanghai on official business, and our reporter specially visited him to report on the situation of the army as follows: Recently, during the Allied forces' Henan campaign, many Chongqing soldiers requested to return to General Pang's command, such as the Hebei Advance Army of the 12th Army led by Qiao Lizhi, the troops of Wang Guoran, and the guerrilla forces directly under the First War Zone of Wei Fenglou, all of whom admired the greatness of General Pang's personality and were willing to return. I have already reported this to Chairman Chen. According to the anti-Japanese Chongqing army, there are four levels: the most elite are the adjusted divisions, followed by the reserve army, then the temporarily organized army, and finally the guerrilla forces. The troops previously commanded by General Pang were his directly affiliated army, the 40th Army, and the various guerrilla forces in the Taihang Mountains. The 40th Army was an adjusted division, and the 27th Army was a reserve army, so the cadres of the 24th Group Army are different from other units. On June 17th, the Heilongma regiment of the Communist Eighth Route Army and the Southern Detachment, numbering over three thousand, launched a fierce attack on the 8th machine gun company of the 116th regiment of our 31st division in the area of Liuweizi, east of Weihui, Henan. After our battalion commander Li rushed to the scene, they were completely defeated. In this battle, in addition to an unknown number of enemies captured, over two hundred were killed or wounded, while we only suffered four deaths and ten injuries, achieving a great victory.</p>
<h3>Press Conference at Allied Embassy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road yesterday (17th) at 2:30 PM. Minister of Information Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukuma attended from the embassy. Minister Matsudaira gave a detailed talk on the recent international situation, which lasted for one and a half hours.</p>
<h3>Economic Office Handles Rationing of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau's Baojia Office in this city recently received inquiries from citizens in the district regarding various issues such as ration cards for daily necessities. The office solemnly declared yesterday that the First District Office's Economic Office is responsible for handling the ration cards for daily necessities. Anyone with such questions can inquire at the Economic Office and the Ration Card Office, except for residents of the two districts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the China Youth Corps Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The youth corps organization in this city has been largely completed since the city corps headquarters began organizing it a year ago. In order to assist in improving the city's youth corps organization, the Shanghai branch of the China Youth Party School took advantage of the summer vacation of various schools and consulted the city corps headquarters authorities to select over a hundred teachers and staff from various schools across the city, as well as instructors of youth corps at all levels, to provide them with rigorous training, hoping to cultivate strong cadres to lead the youth of the present era and truly assume their due tasks and missions. Since the beginning of this month, all the trainees have undergone intense training under the scorching sun. Yesterday (17th) at 9:00 AM, the school held an inauguration ceremony for the completed organization of the school corps headquarters. Mr. Xi Peiwen, Deputy Commander of the City Corps, personally presented the flag and delivered a training speech. The ceremony was simple and grand. After the flag was presented, Wu Pengfei, the battalion commander of the school's trainees, led the reading of the oath and the singing of the Youth Corps song. The ceremony ended at 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Staff of the Grain Rationing Association's Permit Issuing Office Openly Engaged in Malfeasance; Apprehended by the Grain Protection Patrol Team</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Security Department, in order to facilitate the transportation of rice from the four suburban counties to Shanghai by rice merchants and improve the people's food supply, specially assigned the Special Task Force to organize a transportation patrol team, led by Captain Weng Tiandan, to specifically investigate unscrupulous elements along the way who extorted money from rice transporters. Since the team has been carrying out its duties, the situation at the designated rice transportation entry points in the city has greatly improved. However, on the 12th of this month, Xu Jinkui, a staff member of the temporary permit issuing office established by the Grain Rationing Association in the Zhoujiaqiao area of ​​western Shanghai, dared to disregard the ban and secretly issued more than fifty temporary permits for transporting rice, colluding with Zhou Mengkang, the owner of the Futai Rice Shop in the town, to sell them to rice merchant He Achang, and divided the proceeds. The patrol team learned of this incident and immediately arrested Xu Jinkui, the staff member of the office, and Zhou Mengkang, the owner of the Futai shop. Fearing that the matter would escalate, Xu and Zhou dared to incite others to bribe them with 30,000 yuan in cash in an attempt to settle the matter. After the third team leader of the patrol team reported the information, Zhang Kaiqin, the acting team leader, personally went to the scene and arrested the perpetrators and the bribery money. Captain Weng interrogated them separately. The perpetrators confessed to illegally selling temporary permits for transporting rice and attempting to bribe after being arrested. Captain Weng stated that there are clear provisions in the law to facilitate the entry of food for the people. The perpetrators dared to collude with each other and engage in malfeasance, hindering legitimate merchants, and dared to openly attempt bribery after the incident, which was extremely audacious. In addition to intensifying the supervision of various rice transportation entry points to prevent such unscrupulous elements from engaging in malfeasance again, the one thousand perpetrators were transferred to the Shanghai Security Department. It is reported that they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Appropriateness of Arbitrary Punishment in the Baojia System</h3>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions in this city, the unified police administration and matters that should be reformed have gradually improved. Recently, the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau of this city, in order to minimize various punishments related to the Baojia system, specifically issued orders yesterday to the police substations in the Lujiawan, Taishan, Huangpu, Changshu, and other districts of this city, stating that in the future, for Baojia-related application procedures that are mistaken or delayed, arbitrary fines should not be imposed. Although police penalties are stipulated by law, consideration must be given to both the law and the people's sentiments. In Baojia matters, the bureau hopes to take a supervisory and guiding stance, providing detailed explanations to the public who are unfamiliar with the procedures. For those who are negligent or intentionally violate the regulations, the matter should be handled according to the severity of the circumstances, following the police regulations through a specific procedure. Each substation was ordered to comply and to inform their officers to conduct inspections at all times, refraining from imposing penalties rashly in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Supplementary and Correspondence Schools Should Immediately Register</h3>
<p>Since the Education Bureau of this city began handling the registration of all private supplementary schools and correspondence schools in the city, various schools have been enthusiastically complying with the order and applying for registration one after another. However, there are still some supplementary and correspondence schools that have not yet completed the registration procedures with the bureau, either due to unfamiliarity with the procedures or time constraints. According to a reporter who spoke with the person in charge of the bureau, the deadline for all private correspondence schools and supplementary schools to apply for registration is the end of July. It is hoped that all schools will complete the procedures at the bureau before the deadline. Those who continue to wait and see or refuse to register will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Correction: In the "Measures for Revising the Stamp Tax Law for Extraordinary Times" issued by this newspaper yesterday, (C) the tax rate table items 14 to 23 should be items 14 to 21, according to a correction received by telegram from the Tax Administration. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Financial Bureau Tax Collection Office Investigates Business Turnover of Commercial Firms</h3>
<p>The collection of business tax in the South, Wusong, Huacao, and Nanshi districts of this city by the Financial Bureau has always been based on quarterly investigations and a single collection. Recently, due to the sharp increase in the cost of living, the quarterly turnover of various companies, commercial firms, and factories has also been increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the collection methods for business tax in each district. It is learned that the Wusong, Nanshi, Huacao, and Punan tax collection offices under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Finance Bureau are now preparing to investigate the business turnover of the various companies, commercial firms, and factories in their respective districts, in order to make adjustments.</p>
<h3>A Factory Recalling the War</h3>
<p>—Police Inspector Jimei</p>
<p>Recently, every morning at seven o'clock, forty or fifty female students mobilized from the Northeast march past the front of the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo. Led by their teacher, this group of students sets off from the dormitory near the police department to the factory. They wear white headbands, sing labor songs with vigor, and wear neat uniforms, exuding sincerity and enthusiasm. Looking out the window, I sincerely admire this genuine expression. Hard work, hard work! Please persevere to the end! And the mothers who love their daughters, coming from distant, remote places to the bustling city of Tokyo, cannot help but shed tears when they see this spirit of selfless sacrifice.</p>
<p>But what is the situation like in the factory where these female students are working today? As the police chief and head of the industrial mobilization headquarters, I went to dozens of companies and factories under my jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Attendance Rate</p>
<p>What is the attendance rate of female students in all the factories in my district today? How much has production increased smoothly? How is the person in charge directing and proceeding? Is the administrative system running smoothly without any problems? I know all these questions completely. In an instant, I thought of these factories at one o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>All factories hold morning meetings at 7:00 AM. Each group leader checks the personnel. Because if there is no roll call, the overall attendance and production efficiency of the factory for the day will not be known. The factory director compiles the group leaders' reports and reports to the company's general manager, and also notifies the mobilization headquarters of the police department.</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, each factory in the district calls in. The police department staff answer the phone. Every day, they say the same thing: "Is this the ○○ Manufacturing Plant? How is it going today? Is the attendance rate 93%? Hard work, hard work! Please work hard!" All the police department staff are very concerned about the factories.</p>
<p>There are many small and medium-sized factories in the district. In the past, each factory had its own strengths and weaknesses, and it was difficult to increase production. But what about recently? All the factories are working very well. Of course, they have not yet reached perfection, but there are some excellent factories. In particular, the workers are very dedicated. Even the senior bad elements with malicious intentions are moved by the workers' enthusiasm for labor. The attendance rate has also improved. Recently, things have been going a bit smoother, so the overall average of each factory has reached a good score of 88%. From the general manager to the employees, everyone is present at the factory between 7:00 and 7:30. The factory is filled with a refreshing and enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, it would be far from the truth to say that there are no bad elements among them. For those workers who are absent from work too often, the police department sends people to investigate or summons them for questioning. Most absentees do so not out of necessity, but because of selfishness and laziness. They participate in things they think are profitable and abandon their factory work. This is the general reason for their absenteeism.</p>
<p>Even if these degenerate elements come to the factory every day, they do not work diligently, so they have a bad influence on others. As long as there is a profit to be made, they immediately run to other factories. In factories with such employees, senior personnel such as the deputy manager have failed to personally direct the work properly. The following has happened recently.</p>
<p>Because there was a factory with a poor attendance rate, I asked the manager about it and said that his guidance was poor.</p>
<p>He replied to me very definitely, "No, there is no such thing." The manager did not accurately know the attendance situation of the workers. Therefore, I showed him the attendance rate table for each factory prepared by the police department.</p>
<p>"Indeed, that's how it is!" Then the manager looked at me and started nodding.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes the deputy manager is too busy and has no time to take care of the daily affairs of the workers, but they should allocate their time to go to the factory, personally ask about the workers' lives, and often encourage them. Only in this way can the company and the factory have good attendance rates and production efficiency. I believe that so-called personal command is definitely not just a matter of rolling up your sleeves and inspecting.</p>
<p>Factory Family</p>
<p>I convene a symposium for the heads of each factory once a month. The venue is the Industrial Patriotic Hall. Everyone is like at home, without any reservations, openly and honestly contributing opinions on increasing production.</p>
<p>On the one hand, all the factories in the district are combined into seven teams to organize the promotion team. The promotion team is divided into teams and goes to the factories of other teams to check the methods of improving efficiency and point out various production problems in order to strengthen production. Naturally, the principle is not to hinder other factories, and the inspection lasts for two or three hours before leaving. At the same time, the police department also sends a police officer to accompany them. The report from this promotion team is also presented at the symposium. Sometimes, if there are suitable people, they are invited to give lectures on the current situation. After many such symposiums, the heads of the factories who previously excluded each other gradually became close. They shake hands with each other, with a sense of fighting to the end. It is truly a delightful thing. When the intimacy between the factories deepens, the police and the factories become very close. When something happens, they consult with the police, and some workers also come to consult about problems.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all the factories in my district are progressing smoothly. Among them, there is a factory that I admire the most. I will briefly excerpt and record it.</p>
<p>Mr. Nakajima, the general manager of ○○ Watch Co., Ltd., is an elderly man of 75 years old this year, but he has a spirit of vigor despite his age, and he is usually at work before 7:10 in the morning. The production efficiency of the company is very high, and the following happened at the end of last year.</p>
<p>"Now that the prices in Japan are so high that we cannot live, can we increase our allowances?" This was a request from all employees to the company. So General Manager Nakajima said:</p>
<p>"What you say is very true, and everyone's hope is not unreasonable. I also want to meet everyone's urgent needs, but I would like everyone to consider one thing. This is not a special matter. I believe that there has been too much waste in the company before. In the future, we will eliminate the waste, and the money saved can all be used as everyone's allowance for everyone to enjoy."</p>
<p>As a result, all the employees rose up and responded to the general manager's words. Even the smallest pencil stub is used, and the back of the paper is also used for writing. As a result, the waste was reduced by three yuan a month. The company also contributed 2,000 yuan, a total of 5,000 yuan, as a family allowance for the employees. What a meaningful thing this is!</p>
<p>I believe that from the manager to the employees, everyone must have a spirit of cherishing the factory. The employees must develop a feeling of not wanting to leave the factory, and at the same time, they must work hard for the factory without complaint.</p>
<p>One Heart and One Mind</p>
<p>On the other hand, the administrative staff must also be serious. At ○○ Camera Co., Ltd., the administrative staff and the workers go to work together in the morning. After 5:00 PM, the administrative staff run to the factory to help the workers with various miscellaneous tasks. They finish the work, such as tidying up after the workers have finished their work, or cleaning. Only by doing this can the workers be willing to work hard.</p>
<p>Recently, the workers have been very busy, and they don't even have time to get a haircut. Because the barber shops are already closed after they finish work. Therefore, the barbers in my district discussed and decided to serve at the workers' dormitory. This can be said to be service, or it can be said to be consolation. The workers from the countryside are very happy. Because they are busy at the factory, they cannot get a haircut with peace of mind. But when they return to the dormitory after finishing work, and after eating, when they have nothing to do, they start getting their hair cut. It really feels like being at home. The workers receive the warmth of family love. So some of them even shed tears of gratitude and say, "Thank you!" The barbers are also very moved and say, "Please work hard!"</p>
<p>"Since we started going to the dormitory to cut hair, we really feel that this is service, so we are very happy." This is what the barber said when he saw me visiting. When I see this situation, I want to help the workers as much as possible. It is based on this mentality that I used my days off last year and the year before to organize amateur theater troupes twice. When the performance begins, the workers elect actors from the factory to help. This is because they love their own factory, so they have achieved very good results.</p>
<p>Therefore, the workers can carry out raids against the enemy, the United States and Britain, in the factory. From 4:00 PM, it is the raid time. When the advance horn is blown, everyone wears a white headband. During this hour until 5:00, everyone invigorates their tired bodies from the day and works with all their strength. My daughter, who ran to the factory to work after school, said very moved after this raid time was over, "I want to work in that factory!"</p>
<p>I believe that the factory must also be filled with the spirit of true Japanese people. Managers, guards, workers, administrative staff, etc., all must be of one heart and one mind, striving to increase production, and must establish truly awakened and dedicated Japanese factories.

<h3>Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions: Utilizing Administrative Institutions</h3>
<p>Fourth, when operating the contribution system, it is better to adopt the Baojia head-centered approach rather than the township head-centered approach. There are many criminals among the township heads because they are regarded as "traitors" by the enemy bandits, so most ordinary people are unwilling to be township heads. As a result, they are often occupied by rascals and bad elements. Of course, under the anti-communist pacification work, there are also good model township heads, but in terms of fee collection, abuse should be avoided, and people above the township head level should be used. The Baojia heads are relatively more likely to be residents of the village, mostly farmers who care about the situation in the village. Therefore, it is hoped that the Baojia head-centered purchasing strategy will be implemented, and that normal cooperation between the business firms and the Baojia heads and their residents will be established.</p>
<p>Fifth, the national government and the Rice Control Commission should pay cooperation fees for the cooperative purchase of administrative agencies.</p>
<p>Purchasing cannot rely on the individual efforts of each business firm. It is absolutely necessary for all relevant agencies to provide guidance and assistance. There should be assistance fees for administrative agencies. The expenditure of these fees should not be a formal bonus to the county magistrate. The most cooperative contributors and purchasers should be accurately identified. At the same time, administrative agencies should never act as purchasing agents. This must be strictly rooted out.</p>
<p>Sixth, the contribution quota should be based on the Baojia unit, and the Baojia head should proportionally allocate the quantity to each farmer's household, and determine it according to the cultivated area and the number of family members. Unfair quotas, such as previously giving more lenient treatment to self-cultivating farmers and stricter treatment to poor farmers, should be eliminated.</p>
<p>When stipulating the quota, the cultivated area and the population of the Baojia should be used as the basis. The report of cultivated area is extremely inaccurate, and there are various malpractices. Although this is sometimes reported, setting the quota based on the area itself becomes a cause of unfairness. For example, there is a tenant farmer who cultivates seven mu of land and a self-cultivating farmer who cultivates fifteen mu of land. If a uniform amount is stipulated per mu, it is obviously unfair. The difference between the harvested amount and the amount used by the farmer's household should be deducted as the contribution amount. Therefore, it is best to stipulate that the quota is the smallest for poor farmers, and more for middle peasants, landlords, and absentee landlords. The realization of quota fairness is not only a technical problem, but the quota should be fair, and farmers should not groan under an excessive burden.</p>
<p>Seventh, the farmer's loss caused by the difference between the contribution price and the market price should be protected by allocating necessary materials at a subsidized price. If the material allocation cannot be implemented quickly, a contribution bonus must be paid to avoid a large loss for the farmers.</p>
<p>How the purchase price will be determined in the future is still unclear, but the problem of price difference will inevitably occur unless a comprehensive policy of purchasing at market prices is adopted. The allocation of exchange materials is certainly necessary, but if it is delayed, its effect will be halved. Its allocation should be implemented during the peak purchasing period. If this is difficult to implement, a bonus system must be adopted for contributors as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Eighth, in order to realize the simplification and speed of purchasing, the special and civil use purchases should be distinguished. The special use should be the responsibility of the Rice Control Commission, and the civil use rice should in principle be purchased freely, and the administrative agency should implement the local civilian food rice policy.</p>
<p>As Shanghai and other places in the mainland will advocate this method, the special use rice should be purchased in the early stage in order to realize it. If the work of the Rice Control Commission is delayed until the period between harvests, as in the past, this will not only hinder the security of special use rice, but also increase the insecurity of the future of civil use rice, causing a more profound rice problem.</p>
<p>In summary, the administrative purchasing system can continue to be used in the future under a comprehensive reform policy. (Translated from the Continental New Report, June 25)</p>
<h3>Air Raid Shelter Construction Essentials: Shelter Size</h3>
<p>The size of the shelter is not a critical issue, as it is for a short period. As long as the family can all fit inside, even if it is a little cramped, it does not matter. Generally speaking, one square meter is enough for four adults to sit or two people to lie down for shelter.</p>
<p>If a shelter accommodates too many people, the impact will be huge if it is hit by a direct hit bomb. Therefore, the scale of each shelter should be kept as small as possible, and shelters that accommodate many people should be built separately.</p>
<h3>In the Case of Tall Buildings</h3>
<p>In offices in concrete and steel buildings, the building itself has considerable bulletproof effectiveness, so the rooms can be used immediately as shelters. However, in general, the second-floor rooms from the top floor, the rooms on the ground floor that are close to the outer walls, the rooms near the ground and adjacent to the roof of the building that are close to the outer walls of the escalator, or the rooms facing a small atrium, or particularly large rooms, etc. are less safe compared to other rooms, so they should be avoided as much as possible within the possible range. Floor surfaces above the second floor (excluding the first and second floors from the top mentioned above) and not facing the outside, such as in the corridor, or on a floor not close to the outer walls, are particularly safe to use.</p>
<p>If all the rooms on the first and second floors are to be used as shelters due to various circumstances, the windows and entrances are easily destroyed by bombs, and shrapnel and air currents will enter, and glass will shatter. Therefore, sandbags should be piled up in front of the windows to a height of one person, and protective walls should be set up at the entrances and exits to create protective equipment that prevents shrapnel and air currents from entering through these openings.</p>
<p>In addition, it is even safer to appropriately partition the rooms used as shelters, such as with something like an easel. This method can be studied.</p>
<h3>Huacheng Company Liquidation: Shareholders to Share Profits and Losses, Hoping Other Companies Will Follow Suit</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credibility and protect the interests of shareholders, the board of directors of Huacheng Industrial Company in this city decided to convene a temporary shareholders' meeting for voluntary liquidation, selling off the assets, and using the proceeds to recover the shares, returning the full face value of the shares. It has been learned that the general public in this city and the holders of the company's shares have expressed that Huacheng Company's measures are to maintain the general trust in Chinese stock trading and to assist the authorities in stabilizing the social economy, and they have all expressed their appreciation. At the same time, it is also hoped that other companies with listed stocks will automatically liquidate and return the funds if they are in the same situation as Huacheng Company. However, whether there is a profit or loss after the sale of Huacheng Company's assets compared to the total amount of 50 million yuan in shares should be clearly reported at the shareholders' meeting, and the accountant should be asked to verify the accounts. If there is a loss, it should be shared by the shareholders in reverse. If there is a profit, in addition to returning the full face value of the shares, the profit amount should be distributed to the shareholders after deducting expenses.</p>

<h3>Indian News Record</h3>
<p>— Gao Jian Shun</p>
<p>During my time in Rangoon, I read a book introducing India, "Indian Essays" by Robert Byron, which discussed many of India's complexities. In conclusion, it said that India was originally the most difficult country to unify, one of the many reasons being the relationship of the terrain. The poet's observation is very meaningful. Byron has traveled extensively in India, and the vast plains of India, the vast wilderness within sight, show no change in appearance. "Indian scenery lacks color and form. So uniformity is almost all terrifying." It is such a lack of change, on the contrary, this monotonous and unified terrain, of course, there can be no unity in social and political aspects. This is what Byron said. Nature itself is a country of extreme harmony and unity, and its inhabitants are unwilling to live a unified life. All aspects of divisiveness among the Indian people are said to occur naturally.</p>
<p>There is no need to add [?] about Britain's divide and rule policy, which is known to everyone in the world. Byron, a British man, wanted to use the point of view of political geography to defend its claim for such a prominent and notorious policy. It is very interesting to read his article on this point.</p>
<p>The best example of the divide and rule policy is the number of India's astonishing princely states. Now let us briefly introduce its general outline. One country with a population of more than 60 million participating in the Princely Conference and each having a seat is 108; [?] There are 127 two [?] princely states with a population of more than 8 million and sending 12 representatives to the Princely Conference. There are another 327 small principality states (according to the 1931 survey).</p>
<p>Britain has arranged such a number of princely states in its directly governed territories, but it is obstructing the unification of India, that is, preventing the unification of the anti-revolutionary movement. In addition, the treatment of the princes is allocated to establish friction and infighting among the princes. [?] The foolish princes, because they are loyal to the United Kingdom, will try to improve their treatment as much as possible. — This is the Indian political complexity created by the British.</p>
<p>As for India's "specialty," the friction between Hindus and [?] co-religionists is not known to everyone, and there is no need to add [?]. However, when I met a high-ranking Indian in Rangoon, he lamented that it was after the British invasion of India that it became a "specialty."</p>
<p>Almost all races of India live in Rangoon, and most of the races live in separate districts, that is, even if they are the same Benares people, they must be divided into absolutely different Hindu Benares areas and [?] Benares areas. Even restaurants and vegetable stores, Indian [?] believers and [?] believers also have their own different places to enter and exit. Any small [?] fire food [?] , [?] are also frequently [?] . Therefore, any place that simply accommodates [?] guests will hang a [?] with a star and moon in front of the door to prevent Hindu [?] from breaking in. Hindus will never patronize stores run by the same Bengali, as long as they are run by [?] Bengalis.</p>
<p>The complexity of religion does not stop there. The customs of Hindus are even more complex and strange. For example, servants and [?] servants have different identities. The identity of a cook is a more humble profession than that of a servant. So when we were in Rangoon, we would use Indian [?] servants. Because the war was very fierce, we ordered the cook to work as a servant at the same time, but it was not successful. Therefore, we ordered the servant to work as a cook, and this also encountered the strict refusal of Yanzhou. People with high status doing work with low status will damage the identity of the gods, so it is absolutely "impossible." It is also in accordance with God's will that those with low status do not do work with high status. Regarding identity, I am not ignorant, but I actually want to know. This is a very strange country. What is meant by common sense is that when talking about Indians, we must also know that there are many races, such as the Aryan, [?] Mongolian, and Dravidian. [?] Bose is an Aryan Indian. Famous figures such as Tagore, Ramakrishna, and Vivekananda belong to the Aryan system. The famous Ms. Neyidewo belongs to [?] Gaoer.</p>
<p>But in actual research, it is not so simple. Even if they are Indians of the same Aryan descent, if they are from Bengal Province, they speak Bengali, if they are from Punjab Province, they speak Punjabi, and if they are from Gujarat, they speak Gujarati, and they cannot understand each other. Strictly speaking, they all regard each other as "foreigners."</p>
<p>On December 8, 1942, many things were done in Rangoon, one of which was the Indian Congress. An Indian Independence League lecture was held on the square. Representatives from various Indian groups in Burma, celebrities from all walks of life, etc., enthusiastically debated, believing that the long-cherished wish, the period of Indian independence and liberation, has been approaching. However, when the Tamil (Dravidian) spoke, only the Tamil people among the Indians in the square understood Tamil. Most of the other Indians did not understand it at all. So it was translated into English [?] for the audience to listen to, but this was only for some Indians who understood English [?] . Therefore, in order to allow [?] only English-speaking Muslim Indians to listen, it was translated into Urdu, the official language of the Muslims, but [?] Indians [?] did not understand, so it had to be translated into Hindustani. This is really a troublesome thing.</p>
<p>The complexity of India is fully expressed in this meeting. When such a complex speech ended, a demonstration parade began. I stood at the corner of the street, watching such a long line of characters, and I was very moved. Look! The [?] believers and Hindus of canine hatred, aren't they carrying [?] in friendship and peace?</p>
<p>Please see again! Aren't the lowly also marching with the monks of the high status? The wealthy merchants of [?] and Mumbai also participated in the demonstration parade together with the poor Tamil laborers. It was the British who created such racial divisions in India in the Middle Ages. Now this shackle has been shattered. Under the great goal of Indian independence, all Indians have abandoned [?] their differences and united. The unity seen in this demonstration parade on December 8 soon formed the [?] of the Indian National Army.</p>
<p>And the National Army has already advanced into India. India has already abandoned the complexity of India as promoted by the British, and has seen the united posture of the Indian people. The independence of India will destroy the [?] control of the British, liberate India, and at the same time liberate the Indian people from the deformed complexity.

<h3>Curbing the Black Market for Gold</h3>
<p>The price of gold has been rising for years, and the reason for this is the impact of the current situation in recent years. However, the rise in gold prices is particularly easy to stimulate rising prices. As a result, the city authorities have repeatedly tried to make gold prices tend to be stable, but ordinary speculators do not understand the overall situation, act against the public good, stir up trouble, and raise gold prices to satisfy their selfish desires; and the Taiping people have also failed to consider the difficult times, and have always been blinded by greed, hoarding a large amount of gold to protect the value of their property. It must be known that one person seeking profit and all people vying to buy can not but make gold prices soar. And stimulating prices, disturbing people and harming oneself, and causing panic among the people, there is a tendency to be restless all day long. If this continues, what can be imagined! In addition to expressing our deep regret, we hope that the authorities will quickly take appropriate measures, which is a matter of urgency. The fluctuations in gold prices in the past three years are briefly described below:</p>
<p>I remember that from February to May of the previous year, the price of gold per 1,000 taels (with each tael as a unit) continued to jump to 1,800 yuan. In mid-June, due to the replacement of the old and new legal tender, it once jumped to 4,000 yuan in old legal tender. On the 17th of the same month, the new legal tender was uniformly used, and the price of gold was also changed from 4,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan by 20%. Therefore, although the new and old legal tender were calculated at a ratio of one to two, the price of gold remained calm and unhurried, and by the end of the year, it had already broken the 3,000 yuan mark!</p>
<p>Subsequently, in February of last year, the price of gold rose from 3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. The authorities ordered the closure of the four major silver houses, namely Qiutian Shi, Lao Fengxiang, Xin Fengxiang, and Fang Jiuxia. And other major silver houses also immediately and automatically closed. Although they repeatedly requested to resume business, the authorities believed that the matter was related to the stability of finance, and it was necessary to carefully consider appropriate measures in the future. It was delayed until April 21 before resuming business, and it was stipulated that the limit price of market transactions should not exceed 5,000 yuan. Therefore, for two months, the price of gold was as calm as ever. By July, ordinary speculators stirred again, and at first, because of the authorities' strict measures, they did not dare to despise the law, and did not dare to exceed the limit price. But as time went by, they became playful, and re-launched the waves, approaching the 10,000 yuan mark. Later, due to the purchase of cotton cloth, rumors said that the residual sound might affect gold, so after Wanzhi reached the 8,000 yuan mark, the authorities took appropriate measures. For half a year, gold has always been stable at the 10,000 mark, and prices have not been much affected, and the people's hearts are stable, which is indeed a period of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Until the end of January to mid-February of this year, the aftershocks were re-launched, and the price of gold soared from 10,000 yuan to 14,000 yuan. Until the end of February, the Central Reserve Bank, due to the rise in gold prices, which affected the stability of finance, allocated a small portion of its inventory, tens of thousands of taels of gold, to silver houses for dumping. At the same time, it sold as much as possible at a low price of 11,500 yuan. It can be seen that the fiscal authorities care for the people's hardships and seek to suppress prices, and for a time, they have eliminated the rise in gold prices. However, it was not for many days before the distribution was stopped, resulting in the failure of all previous efforts, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Since the Central Reserve Bank stopped distributing gold, the silver houses also stopped business. Until March 11, the authorities implemented a gold allocation system, and appropriately increased the selling price to 15,000 yuan. At the end of March, it once fell to 13,000 yuan. In April, it slightly returned to about 14,000 yuan. Until the beginning of May, it was still hovering between 14,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, within this month, it rose by 100 yuan every day, so by the end of May, it was 18,700 yuan. In mid-June, it had exceeded the 20,000 mark, and by the end of June, it had risen to 27,300 yuan every day. Especially in the month of Muyue, the wind of rising prices was more intense, reaching 37,500 [?]. If this crazy rise continues, it will really affect the stability of the entire finance.</p>
<p>It is found that the rise of gold prices in recent months is due to the imperfect allocation market. Each silver house in the city sends staff members to the city market every day to listen to the market prices, and purchase according to the needs of the store, without any obstruction. Unexpectedly, before long, ordinary silver houses from other places also registered for allocation in Shanghai, which is reasonable. However, there are unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to sell the allocated gold to the black market at high prices, seeking to satisfy their personal pockets. As a result, the average allocation number of each silver house in this city has decreased, which is enough to affect the retail business, making it impossible to cope with customers, and customers have to turn to the black market for entry. As a result, the higher the price in the black market, the higher the allocation price by the authorities, forming a trend of rising every day.</p>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices, the stimulation of prices is profound and huge. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the allocation to other places will be stopped immediately. The above two points are the most urgent things.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Changes and the Future of Shanghai's Economy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhou</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year, all things have risen in price, but only the stock market has been depressed, and has been falling continuously. Most small-cap stocks have fallen far below the par value, about 50% lower, and the better ones are still hovering around the par value. Various gangs and large accounts have repeatedly implemented short-selling, deliberately suppressing market prices, so that popular stocks and unpopular stocks have both collapsed and plunged. Most small investors were so frightened that their souls flew away, and many stock firms were also stranded and liquidated. This period was the most vicious period since the stock exchange resumed business, and all parties almost talked about the stock market with a change of face. It is conceivable how bad the outside world's impression of the stock market is.</p>
<p>After the vicious development of the stock market made the authorities pay close attention, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank, based on the instructions of the upper authorities, announced on July 10 that they would reorganize the pledge of Chinese stocks. It was also rumored in the market that the authorities would establish a Chinese Stock Stabilization Fund to maintain the normal development of stock prices. When the news came, people's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the stock market showed a new atmosphere that had never been seen before since the 12th.</p>
<p>The securities market has always been the best place to accommodate floating capital. According to investigations by relevant parties, no less than ten million [?] yuan of floating capital in the city is used for commodity speculation. This omnipresent floating capital has already caused no small harm. In addition, what can teach gold to not rise greatly and prices to not skyrocket in the past six months after the huge amount of capital withdrawn from the stock market? The common people have simply suffered greatly, and the middle and upper classes have also felt that their burdens are gradually increasing. Therefore, if we want to stabilize the current unstable economy of Shanghai from the storm, what other way is there besides inducing floating capital to return to the stock market, so that the people's livelihood and industry will immediately benefit from it? The government should quickly plan concrete and special policies to deal with it.</p>
<p>The reasons for the stock market's depression can be described as follows. In the past, because there were many rumors and credit was tight, the stock market was very weak. As soon as it heard the rumors, it blindly sold off, and the psychological panic was abnormal. In addition, a small number of members among the Guang Gang, yarn flower gang, and bank gang took the opportunity to sell short, and many short positions were added to the market, so can prices not fall sharply? In particular, the bank gang often uses customers' pledge materials to sell short on a large scale in the stock market, suppressing market prices and profiting from it, which is the most hateful thing that endangers the entire economy. It is hoped that the Central Reserve Financial Inspection [?] will expose or advise on it within the possible scope, so that the [?] breeze [?] [?] [?] , then the future of the stock industry will be fortunate.</p>
<p>In the course of this long-term decline, large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks have both fallen by an average of 50%. Although the responsibility mainly lies with short-selling speculators, the unhealthy nature of the company enterprises themselves of these small-cap stocks cannot be blamed. The indiscriminate increase in capital has caused a large increase in the stock [?] , and of course, a vicious overabundance will occur. In the future, it is hoped that the company enterprises [?] ask whether it is not [?] perfect, and should imitate the method of the supervisory resolution of Huacheng Industrial Company, and appropriately recover the stocks at par value. Those who have not paid dividends for the previous year will pay generous interest to the shareholders in order to maintain credit. At the same time, the powerful large accounts will also do their best to maintain it. Once the investors' interest is drawn back, the stock market can surely show its edge greatly, and the large absorption of floating capital will naturally not be a problem. In addition, it is hoped that the relevant authorities and the Central Reserve Bank will urge and work hard to establish Shanghai's new economic market. Prices can fall, and the people's difficulties can gradually be alleviated.</p>

<h3>Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Receives Enthusiastic Purchases from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics has seen a steady stream of visitors daily, causing considerable crowding. Due to the overwhelming number of precious items received, it is impossible to display them all simultaneously, so they will be rotated in succession. Currently, no fewer than several thousand items are on display, a dazzling and breathtaking sight. Most notable are a painting of a divine falcon by Song Zheng, which will be sold in a competitive charity auction, as well as landscapes by Liu Bowen and calligraphy and paintings by Tang Bohu, all rare and invaluable treasures.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a photography exhibition by Mr. Lin Zihong, housed in two separate rooms, showcasing his latest spring travel works, which have been highly praised by the audience. The antique section features an ivory "Loving Son" figure over a foot tall, exquisitely carved; a large Yuan dynasty Jun kiln double-eared vase with raised floral decoration; a Song dynasty Jun kiln tiger pillow; a Kangxi famille verte vase; a Kangxi blue and white vase; Qianlong jadeite and white jade pieces; as well as bronzes from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and various famous porcelains, all exceptionally valuable. To meet the requests of visitors, the organizers have specially invited renowned calligraphers and painters Qian Hailong and Xu Hanchen to showcase their skills every afternoon, starting today, to add to the artistic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Seeking Classrooms for Charity School</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Our school is jointly organized by several deaf-mute teachers with the aim of promoting education for the deaf-mute and benefiting fellow sufferers. It has been established for two years. Previously, the school building was shared with another institution, but recently, due to plans for that site, the landlord has given us a deadline to move. The school has no choice but to seek alternative premises. However, due to these extraordinary times, finding a suitable building is not easy, and as the staff are mostly deaf-mute and of limited means, despite repeated attempts to negotiate subletting, no satisfactory outcome has been achieved. Nevertheless, in order to uphold our original intention, we cannot bear to see these disabled students abruptly deprived of their education. Therefore, we have no choice but to plead for help from the outside world. If any kind-hearted individuals or schools can lend us one or two classrooms to allow us to continue teaching and benefiting deaf-mute children, it would be an immeasurable act of kindness. Sincerely, Guangzhen Deaf-Mute School (Temporary address: No. 20, Renheli, Laochan Bridge)</p>
<p>We, a group of young professionals in this city, are concerned about the decline of the social economy and the increasing number of students dropping out of school. We are willing to dedicate our spare time to run a free night school, offering classes from 7 to 9 pm every evening, completely free of charge, and providing books. Therefore, we are seeking two classrooms. If the authorities of schools in the Old Zhabei District and the New Chengdu District can appreciate our sincerity and offer cooperation by lending or subletting classrooms, please indicate the rent and send a letter to No. 40, Fuming Village, Fuxu Road, or contact us by telephone at 39759. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Shen Wen</p>
<p>Donation of Medicine</p>
<p>Shanghai Girls' High School sent a letter stating: "We are writing to inform you that a certain impoverished student of our school received financial assistance from your newspaper. Deeply grateful for your newspaper's service to society and its benevolent support for the needy, she has solicited Mr. Lin Zhengxiong for twenty boxes of Zhongying Shasha medicine, totaling eight hundred bottles. Please ask your newspaper's service center to distribute them to impoverished teachers. We are immensely grateful." This student, having received help, does not forget to repay society's kindness, and in turn, helps others. Her aspirations are commendable. We will distribute the medicine on her behalf. All impoverished teachers may write to us to request it.</p>
<p>Donations for Medical Aid</p>
<p>Medical aid is one of the four services provided by our office. Its purpose is to help the poor and sick, and relieve suffering and danger. Those whose families are truly impoverished and unable to afford medical treatment can apply to us for assistance or be introduced to contracted doctors and hospitals for free treatment.</p>
<p>Donations for medical aid provide opportunities for the poor and sick to receive treatment. The grace of this action is widespread, and the merit is immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sakura and Gunkan (10)</p>
<p>The jovial Lieutenant Yuasa, regardless of others' pleasure, dragged Ichito and Takao into the living room, led Takao to the guest seat, and introduced him to everyone. "Ah, this is good enough. Please have a drink!" Takao thought Lieutenant Yuasa was a straightforward person. The introduced Ensign Nitta was a sturdy man with subdued eyes and broad shoulders. Another Ensign, Hara, was a gentle and quiet person like a statue. These two looked at Ichito as if they knew him well and, after giving him an affectionate look of greeting, started chatting.</p>
<p>Two or three sake pots were arranged on the dining table. Lieutenant Yuasa seemed to be the main character in this scene.</p>
<p>"Old Tani, you still don't drink? I originally stipulated that we drink on Saturdays, but the last week and the week before last, we all broke the rules. Tonight, we haven't had such a good time. Hey, Nitta, are you having a good drink?"</p>
<p>Lieutenant Yuasa shouted happily like this. "Not yet, not yet," he said, waving his hand. Ensign Nitta's voice was like a broken gong, and Takao couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Nitta, tomorrow I will take a person to the submarine school to visit. It just so happens to be Sunday, I'm really sorry, please take care of him!"</p>
<p>Ichito seemed to have prepared his words beforehand. The friend from the water management school he mentioned earlier seemed to be Ensign Nitta. That Ensign seemed to be going to listen to some kind of course.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Ensign Nitta's broken gong voice was only one word.</p>
<p>When Takao heard this way of speaking of the naval officers, the image of the officers and officials who visited the Isuzu warship in Yokosuka appeared again in his mind. No, this time the atmosphere was even more lively and refreshing than that time. Takao felt immensely honored to be in this atmosphere. Therefore, he could not help but let the naval officer's long-cherished wish that had been suppressed in his subconscious revive again.</p>
<p>"Since you read naval books, then you must know our secret language."</p>
<p>Lieutenant Yuasa was right.</p>
<p>"Ah, certainly..."</p>
<p>"For example, people on warships call "Good morning" as "Good." Especially when speaking to superiors, you must speak in naval language, otherwise you will be scolded."</p>
<p>"Haha! It's really simplified."</p>
<p>"Yes. But you probably don't understand this sentence! What does "Ke Pa" mean?"</p>
<p>"It's your daughter. Isn't your daughter "daughter"? Copper is Copper, and according to the ancient pronunciation, it is "your daughter"."</p>
<p>Takao burst out laughing. Meaningless, completely like middle school students, creating secret language. ——（119）</p>
