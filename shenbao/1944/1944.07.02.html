<h3>星期評論　論畸形政治</h3>
<p>— 沈志遠</p>
<p>畸形政治可以說就是病態政治。每當國家興廢絕續的時候，舊的社會秩序，道德，法律，統統給皺壞了，而新的社會秩序，道德，法律，一時還沒建立起來，於是在這新舊「脫軌」時妝，整個社會是瘋狂的，人民心理是變態的，國家政治措施是反常的，日常經濟生活是極度艱苦的，舉凡耳所聞，目所見，每個部門，每個階層，每個角落，殆無不顯示着極嚴重的病態，所謂貪官，汚吏，奸商，巨煮，便是這種種病態下所產生的州矚子」，所謂「子弒其父，弟殺其兄」的倫常慘變，也就無足驚寄，而「上無道揆，下無法守」，更是確切說明這一時代的政治特徵·</p>
<p>中國三千年來的歷史，往往是三十年一小亂，五十年一大亂，所謂「亂」，便是畸形政治的充分暴露。而歷史家所歌頸的小康之世，如漢代文景之治，唐朝貞觀之政，那就是畸形政治遁跡於無形的時候。如此治亂循環，互為因果，於是天下大勢，便難逃「分久必合，合久必分」的天演公例。所苦者，人民生活在政治昇平時代的機會極少，而樓息於畸形政治之下的時間則較長，這其間原因至夥，有時候可以說是由於有治人而無治法，有時候可以說是由於有治誅而無治人，甚至有時候又可說是由於治人治法兩者俱無，如此，人足祇好讓悲慘的命運來擺佈了。</p>
<p>畸形政治，分折言之，究是何等現象呢？這裹且借一段話來說明：五代時後唐長興三年大理少卿康澄上明宗皇帝書云：</p>
<p>「國家有不足懼者五，有深可畏者六：陰陽不調不足懼，三反失行不足懼，小人訛言不足懼，織崩川涸不足懼，蟊賊傷稼不足懼：賽人藏匿深可畏，四民遷業深可畏，上下相徇深可畏，廉恥道消深可畏，毀譽亂眞深可畏，直言蔑聞深可長；不足懼者願陛下存而不論，深可畏者願陛下修而靡志。</p>
<p>賢人藏匿，四民遷業，上下相徇，廉恥道消，毀譽亂終，直言蔑聞，斯六者，如果綜合起來，便是集畸形政治之大成。本來賢人應該是在朝掌握致權的，不如此，不能做到「君子道長，小人道消」，如果本身愛惜羽毛，自鳴淸島磚不肯去跳火坑，反而要做山林隱逸，那就是崎形現象。士農工商，應該是各執其業，各守本分，如果公務員兼營商業以牟利，小學敎師因生活壓迫而改拉黃做車，或是暴發戶忽然想過官癮，於是輩金運動，找綫素，鑽門路，百計千方，以達目的，這就是社會病態。還有，「禮義廉恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃滅亡」，如果不顧廉恥，儘管笑　由人，好官我自為之，試問這算是茶麽世界！至若上下勾結，通同作弊，是非不分，賞罰不明，倒行逆施，不納忠言，設想國家果眞到了如此地步，人足所受苦痛，其慘酷不言可喩。</p>
<p>所以歷史上每次大亂之餘，接著往往是一個短時期或是較長時期的昇平時代。雖說國家一治一亂，是一個必然的循環公式，但如能多盡一分人事，多從各方面去消滅畸形政治的各項因素，至少能把上述深可畏的六點，一一改正過來，人民在水深火熱中的痛苦，也就逐激緻少，人民痛苦减少，就是國家政治，社會秩序，都走上了正常的軌道，循此以進，由小康之世達到大同之境，絕非奢望。但千萬要記住；人類歷史是創造出來的，別讓無情的命運永遠支配，別老是逆來順受地任其自然，尤其是在這當前的動盪中的大時代，別辜負了吾們所應該負起的使命</p>

<h3>衡陽城內　渝軍猛烈抵抗　日軍由三方面進攻</h3>
<p>湖南日軍前綫一日電日軍部隊包圍衡陽後，自二十九日晨以來，即三方面對城內頑抗之渝軍，及第十師暫編五十四師，展開最後猛攻。渝軍因日軍自西北方及東北方等，三方同時攻擊，已被切斷退路，猛力作最後抵抗，展開猛力鑿防戰。尤其巿街南方，以無數之湖水為中心，渝軍之反攻極形猛烈。日軍部皺亦對之加以攻擊，至三十日仍在激戰中。目前有淪車一部已不能支持日軍猛攻，於市街縱火，致市街一角黑烟冲天，化為灰燼。又衡陽郊外來江之粤漢終鐵橋，亦已被炸燬。</p>
<h3>日軍攻略衡陽情形</h3>
<p>衡陽日軍前錢一日中央社電　據隨軍記者報吿攻略衡陽情形稱：折陽現已陷於包國前夕，際此最後抵抗之時，記者在砲聲隆隆中，發送第一封通訊。吾等於二十七日晨，渡過湘江，（衡陽東南約十公里），當日下午，突入衡陽南郊，（距市內三公里）。作戰開始以來歷一閱月，冒暑熱跋涉泥渾中，踏破八百公里之路程，渝軍重要軍事據點，遂出現於目前。城前洗有湘江，城內數處火焰沖天，與對岸擊傷之黑烟，結成一片，　沒天空。所有丘陵中，均滿築陣地，丘陵之斜面掘有深達六米之大戰車溝迥繞，由　倦中之槍洞，可望見日方交通溝縱橫遍地，不知通達何處。日軍精銳部隊，於是日正午，開始猛攻，現已有突入巿內情勢。日軍佔領丘陵後，立即安裝大砲，開始轟擊，郊外有吾州等夢想難及之近代電力工廠，駐渝駐美軍與渝軍，陸上部隊呼應時，出現於戰場上空。六月二十三日，命令巿民疏散，竟不留一人，完全撤退，故甚至小孩，亦不見一人，家家緊閉門戶，街頭到處有被掠奪之跡痕。渝軍有山砲四門，及破擊砲等，炮彈橫飛，衡陽市之作戰，入晚益趨激烈。</p>
<h3>日軍猛烈　攻入湘鄉</h3>
<p>湖南日軍前綫一日中央社電　於十五日完全攻略寗鄕之日軍某部隊，可謂為鐵脚部隊，該部隊對於寗鄕南方敗走之淪第（七十四）軍，展開殲滅戰。同時，日主力部隊，復向湘鄕開始猛烈進攻，渝第四集團軍之一部坐力，誤斷日軍正舉主力攻略長沙，於是企圖奪回寗鄉，然日軍某都隊對寗縐湘鄕航路四週之淪軍，層開大包圍職。並於十九召最，將保子峰附近四百渝軍，及朱自橋附壯擁有槍砲及軍馬二千數百之渝軍，予以完全殲滅，而緊迫湘鄉。渝第二十四軍，尙興最後抵抗，然經日軍突然進擊，日軍遂於二十日晨，自湘潭西方之前衛陣地，攻入湘鄕。湖南空日機活躍</p>
<h3>湖南上空　日機活躍</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地一日中央社電　日軍眞長沙進攻衡陽以來，作戰殊爲迅速。日來湖南上空陰靈密佈，連日陰雨綿綿，但日軍地上部隊，與偵察及襲擊兩部隊，並不因雨而作一日休息，仍部斷隊渝軍縐續進擊。同時日空軍部隊於上空展開掩護工作，於陰雨之惡劣氣候中，沿湘江低空，飛向衡陽，待基隊返抵基地時，均似水鼠。若又復奉攻擊命令，則又反復對渝軍綴擊，故渝軍地上部隊，對於賺空軍之急降轟炸隊，在雨天亦大隊來擊，均感無限恐怖。</p>
<p>廣州一日中央社電據渝電稱，日航空部隊，二十七日晨轟炸福建省東部沿岸洞口及三都澳。</p>
<h3>零陵上空展開劇戰</h3>
<p>日軍某基地三十日中央社電　日機廿六日空襲駐渝美空軍基地零陵，展開壯烈空矚。綠日職鬥機編隊接獲部隊長之命令後，即項躍出發，於十一日飛抵零陵，於高空發現渝美機二架，即展開空戰。　有渝美機四十餘架，參加作職，日織當即集中，出奇制勝。旋整落渝美機（州40）型機一架，完成最初之攻擊，鑄散渝美機陣勢，雙方遂入混職狀態。激鬥歷四十分之久，擊落渝美機十架，其隊長即下令脫離戰塲，但渝美機見日機有飛返之意，即又以追隨編隊猛襲，空職仍極激烈，日機戰隨走，至永豐（衡陽西北方七十公里）上空，空戰始吿終結。</p>
<h3>美機空襲平　江受挫</h3>
<p>日軍某基地一日中央社電　日新銳戰鬥機隊二十九日晚，發現駐渝美空軍加齊斯D40型機一架，北美P51型機一架，侵入平江（湘省）南方上空，立即加以猛襲·敵綴圖向南方還走，於長沙西南約三十公里上空，即遂次加以猛攻，以超低度追擊。此時又有敵P40型P51型機入架，自高空襲擊，日機即以低位態勢，加以反攻，激戰二十分鐘，擊落敵P41型機二架。</p>
<h3>日軍在怒將西側　施集中攻擊　渝軍主力己陷包圍中</h3>
<p>怒江前綫日軍某基地一日中央社電　怒江西側日軍，以渝軍第七十九軍之主力第八十七師渡過怒江，猛攻孟昌街，乃對之施以集中攻擊。二十四日突破渝軍陣地數處，繼于小松樹西北則繫渝軍主力，渝軍于日軍包圍中，雖度作頑强逆襲，卒為日軍擊退，渝軍殆已喪失一千五百之衆，日軍刻仍于該地區中繼續保衛殲滅中，渝算遺棄屍體，彈藥及武器等均甚夥。按渝軍第二次孩子怒江德反攻，對八十七師曾作莫大期望，但渝軍八十七師奪回龍，陵之企圖，因遭日軍猛攻，兵力即蒙甚大損失，而陷于一大混亂。</p>
<h3>浙東日軍　佔湯溪龍游　完成打通浙贛綫</h3>

<h3>日行政查察規程　經定例閣議修正</h3>
<p>——新參與委員愼重銓衡中——</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電日政府為增加行政效率，曾自貴·眾兩院議員及民間有資望者中指定約三百名為委員，於內閣及各省設立委員制度輔佐應務，該制度自實施以來，業滿三年，其間毀受各大臣之委托，進行各種調支，輔佐各省部政策之準進及普及之國策，均不遺餘力。目下各委員任期已滿二年，政府藉此機會決定將該制度廢止，新設內閣及各省參與委員制度，委員總數將相當减少（約滅半數），各委員將直接參與重要總務，今後各廳行政查察之活躍，預料將有預期之進展。依此措置，三十日定例閣議席上，鑿將內閣及各省參與委員制度擊行政查察規程予以修正，並於二日以官報發表實行，依行政查察幾程一部之修正，於舊有之行政查察使之外，另設行政查察委員。爲求行政查察制度更趨周密澈底，故於各廳局高等官之外，新州行政査察委員，過去成為懸案之議會人士參與行政間題，即多戰議會人向持法之根據，以議會人非官吏不適合政務官制度，自此，全面行政查察制度之　施，已見一大效果。戰時行政效率運營，議會人才能之發輝，即將有新的活躍。新參與委員制銓衛，政府正愼重進行中，不日即將發表。</p>

<p>柏林一日中央此電德外交部發言評論州德芬協定稱：兩國民間之共同作戰精神，現係根據堅固之政治原則。</p>
<p>柏林一日中社電海通社訊：最折簽訂之德芬協定，並不影響芬蘭之中權與內國政政策，此為芬外部負責人員之言論，而英·美·瑞典方面，以為德國軍事援芬協定簽訂後，芬蘭之民主政治與主權，業已摧毀無餘之說，遂不攻自破，德國並未操縱芬蘭議會，而在目前情勢下德芬兩國在眾事與政治兩方面聯合行動，亦不足異。</p>

<p>湖南日軍前終某基地廿九日電　日軍展開之湖南進攻作戰，薛岳部下之渝第九戰區，已為日軍圍攻，業已喪其兵之大牛。進擊緻第九戰藻所轄之第卅七軍之日軍，曾在瀏陽和渡河電，俘獲渝軍俘虜，據其所言，知該軍業已完全受美國式軍事訓練。即由渝中英直系第六十師，九十六師，及四川軍所組成之第卅七軍，每誌均配置有美軍將校約十人，而於美國式圳練尙未澈底之際，即遭遇日軍之進攻，此實為於中國大陸設置對日攻勢據點，而欲自空陸攻擊日本本土之美軍奴役渝軍工作之表現。同時，業已變為東亞孤兒之重慶，不憎供美國之豐使，繼續作盲目抗戰，更可知蔣介石所標榜之「中國至上主義」，不過以掩飾此種買過行爲而已，日軍開始攻勢後，渝軍每戰皆敗，一再退却，美國式訓練未奏寸功。渝軍至此，當己體騐美軍之實體究為何物矣。有此事實，可知日軍此次作戰，乃由渝粉碎英美自大陸實施反攻之企圖，旨在保衛大東亞，且顯示英美軍一日不擊滅，日軍將繼續作戰之決意</p>

<h3>北九州擊落的敵美空中</h3>
<p>本月十六日敵美飛織空襲日本北九州地區，被日本空防部隊發揮威力，擊落其大牛。敵方中B29式巨型轟炸機，號稱「超等空中要塞」敵方誇稱絕對不會隊地，結果竟被日軍擊落，使鑿天空軍大為寒心。擊落地點在編岡縣遠賀郡折尾町北方五公里高須的農村，記者富日前往視察，得見殘機的眞相，</p>
<p>重油燒着的敵屍，化為灰燼，臭氣四溢。裝載大批炸彈的中B29式終於擊落了。全輾四十三公尺，全長三十公尺，全部震量四十之噸的巨大機身，在直徑約三百公尺的圓形範圍內，從小山山麓起至麥田一帶，片片粉碎，敵機將士十數名的屍體，肢解割裂，在樹柱上或田裏，到，處可見斷手斷腳和肉片，記者不禁呌道：「自作其孽。」</p>
<p>田中由兩百斤山爆作的炸彈一枚，小未山麓也有未爆發的炸彈一枚，警戒的將校們狂減著：「靠近危險，危險；」附近散棄着推，進機，車輪，輔助油箱，打字機等，樹枝上吊著兩個落下傘，色彩和現地鑿境很不調和。敵屍的懷中口袋裘，搜出的用品中，有一枚布條的護照，上書「來華參戰洋人（美國）軍民一致救護航空委員會字第〇八五三五」，印度銀幣，重慶紙幣，還伺中美會話字典，某地的地圖等等。</p>
<p>這時候制空部隊某將校赶來說明擊落敵機的情形道：「當發現敵機南來的時候，就趕速用探照燈照射，附近的其他部隊亦照射，鑿方照射成十字形，旋即發現龐然巨物，部下大呌好傢伙捉住它，這時那巨物立刻受姿戰鬥機的攻擊，被高射砲彈擊中，就搖搖幌幌如揉錐一般垂直向下，看見機種是中B29……」</p>
<p>敵航空本部長安諾爾特直撰指揮下的超空要塞、就做這樣擊落的。</p>
<p>據到塲視察殘骸的某大尉談稱：「B29式敵機速度為五百五十公里，緻航力為三千八百整里，以高性能誇稱於壯，結果被我擊落，敵方的企圖，珍此推毀無還。擊落之機確為B29雖化為片片，仍可辨認。跌斃的美籍機員，携有印度紙幣和貨幣，孟加拉灣的地圖和氣象圖可以證明是最近自印度飛往中國的。」（譯自六月十九日朝日新聞）</p>
<p>戰局急轉直下日本待機破敵德富蘇峰氏談話</p>
<p>……六月十六日午後日本大本營發表美機空襲北九州的消息後，日本新聞界先進每日新聞社社賓德富蘇峰氏亦於熱海巿伊豆山晚晴草堂私宅述其惑懷略謂：</p>
<p>……我人無須驚惶憂慮。彼等乃所謂飛蛾撲火，自投羅網，正為我撫腕嘆息髀肉復生之精銳空軍的美餌。</p>
<p>……彼等為欲空襲我本土，窮思竭慮，圖於重慶皺區建立基地，然已屢受挫折，且因洛陽陷落而喪失中國四百餘州的立脚地，其企圖行將為我空軍根本摧鄭。不寧唯是，彼等於最緊要之緬甸及印度亦受日軍壓迫。目前印度心臟伊姆法爾之陷落，已為時問問題。際此時機，彼等之空襲日本等行動，全係臟蔽美國人民之手段，恐彼輩自身亦未嘗眞欲有所作為也。魚網雖密，漏網之魚在所難免，潛截綱眼而來之空襲能有多大效果可言？</p>
<p>……於茲尙有一言，即盎格魯撒克遜人係野變蒙味之徒，凡吾所不層為不欲為者，彼等悉坦然為之，恬不知恥。其攻擊棗標非僅無戰鬥員與非戰鬥員之別，甚且專事攻擊非鬥戰員。彼等炸中病院船時，竟大呼快哉！又如文化淵源的羅馬，我盟邦德國早經宣布為非武裝都市，然彼等悍然進攻，不惜令幾千年來之交物燬於一旦。被等且以掃射學童為能事！吾人與被輩戰，實非對人作紙，乃向毒蛇猛獸奮戰也</p>
<p>……余此際更欲高呼者，即德織戰局己因英美軍在法國北部登陸而開始急轉志下，而吾人陸海雙方之戰事亦在大轉變中，此為我一億國民所必須熟知者。吾人隱忍自重至今，其故安在？著人之雌伏正展以等待展翅撲敵之時機也。余敢大呼曰，今後陸海雙方將有一積極的大轉變。吾人引首以望前途之大光明，錚待機會來臨。其時現已刻刻迫近，吾人此際尤不可疏忽。疏忽敗事，此為著入之座右銘。（譯自六月十七日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>商統會新舊理事長　舉行交接儀式　昨在麗都花園舉行情況熱烈</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，於昨日（一日）上午十時在泰興路麗都花園舉行新舊理事畏交接儀式，到全體理事監事及全體職員，各界萊賓，新聞記者等五百餘人，悄况熱烈，儀式簡單隆重。茲分誌各情如次：</p>
<p>開會儀式如次：　開會（上略）　唐前理事長就位　聞理事長就位　全體理監事就位　者前理事長介紹各同人參見聞理事長　本會全體同人起立向聞理事長一鞠躬　唐前理事長致詞　本會全體同人起立向唐前理事長致敬一鞠躬　授印　聞理事長致詞　　理監事致詞　　禮成。</p>
<h3>唐前理事長詞</h3>
<p>唐前理事長致詞大意謂：壽民德薄能鮮，於七年三月問勉就本會理事長職，至今已十五閱月，在此時期中，以統制經濟在我國係屍創舉，一切章制及業務實施，均賴全體同人羣策羣力，熱誠相助，乃得免終隕截，而各位理監州事，皆為各業領袖，出其經騐，匡掖尤多，壽民對此同深感謝。今聞闡亭先生接任商統會第二屆理事長之職，聞先生為商界先進，又本為本會監事長，碩德高年，久孚眾望，毌待本人介紹，惟盼各位同人在聞理寨畏領導之下，各本崗位，愈益努力，使統制經濟工作，日向光明邁進，以不負國家及社會人士之期待，則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>聞理事長致詞</h3>
<p>蘭亭年事已衰不勝繁劇，原任棉統會主委正在躊躇却顧，擬請辭退之際，當局忽以商統會理事長一職相屬，尤非意料所及。迭經懇許。而商界同人，以本會爲商業體自治機構，在此百端代理之時，以蘭亭爲識途老馬，羣以大義相責，蘭亭上承政府之命，下受商界同人之敦促，義難認置。蘭亭衰朽餘生，而許甚社會之顧，蓄之已久，明知會務前途·非蘭亭能勝任，茍欲民生有尺寸之利，蘭亭確守商人本位，竭盡能，犧牲小我，何足深惜。幸有各業領袖相助，前任詹理事長在鎮去一年中磚對於州物資紙工工作，已貝良好基礎，蘭亭自當蕭規曹隨，以竟誌功，深望各同人木諸已往精神努力邁進，以政府統制物資之成策，幷有以戰商界同人之喁望。深獻蘭亭德薄能鮮，終違初願，即當州還我初服，決不敢因循留戀，以誤會務，雖蒙進銳退速之識，亦所不辭。今日就織之始，謹奉直奉陳，聊當息壞。</p>
<h3>林理事康侯詞</h3>
<p>林理事康侯代表全體理監事致詞大意謂：商統會在過去一年餘中，在唐痧民先生領導之下，以事屬初創，壽民先生實已盡心丈，千作萬苦，始有今日之成規，其功誠不可沒。以往商統會工作以環境及機構關係，或未能盡如人意，惟吾人作事但求無愧我心，一切成敗利鈍，則非所計。唐前理寨長製發之證煮標有公正廉明四字，正可移贈新任聞理事長。聞老秉性廉正不阿，人所稱道，希望各位同人，仍保持公正廉明之會訓，各在本位工作，本諸過去精神協助新任理事長。康侯此次以秘書長一時尙無適當人選，暫時兼任秘書長職務，將來人選決定，仍鑽讓賢。</p>
<h3>一區公署　裁汰外籍職員　吳署長發表談話</h3>
<p>第一區公署署長吳頌皋，爲書內外籍職員退職事，昨發表談話如左：自去年上海公共租界行政權，先後交還中國後，工部局原有制度，漸起變化。迨本年二月一日，八區公署併入第一區公署後，除固有行政優點，力予維持外，凡中國國民政府之法令，以及中國之行政體制，均經切實奉行，不遺餘力，期使第一區公署成為上海巿政機構之一重要部份。就人事方面而言，常公共租界交還時，各級職員實際上並無更動，除中日職員不計外，另有二十一國國籍不同之職員在第一區公署工作，此種</p>
<h3>特殊情形</h3>
<p>洵爲近代各國市政機關所少見者。如何使各職員融合一體，開誠合作，顯非易事。一八兩區合併以後，因兩區相同部份之併合，不免人浮於事，逐將各方面職務重行分酌，藉使所有職員，各有專職，各盡所能，使行政效率，不致受有影饗。本年二月以來，本人商承陳市長意旨，復參照中國巿政制度，實施强化區公署之行政機構，其最重要者莫如將一切公文，由英文而改為中文，即其他行政程序，行政紙織，均州以適當之調整，署務之推動，所以能如此則利者，友邦日本當局之</p>
<h3>懇摯相助</h3>
<p>與署內同仁之通力合作，實為本人所紫感佩不己者。就現勢以觀，巿政機構之完全統一，期不在遠。此後本公署對於技術方面，或仍須有外藉職員照常服務之處，但因現行制度旣已一律調整，不諳中國文書程序之外籍職員，欲其一如往日之才職相稱，發揮效能，殊爲困難。因此不能就原有西藉職員二百餘人，酌定牛數，</p>
<h3>予以解職</h3>
<p>並按照服務規則，給予退職時應得之利益。其縱續聘用者，仍當予以保陣，務期蚤才使用，各盡其職。凡此措置，無非根據中國行政立塲而決定，當為各方所能喻解。至日籍職員在本署工作者，約有八十餘人，正當日本當局竭力扶助中國自主之時，</p>
<h3>日藉人員</h3>
<p>能瞭解中日新情勢，即日自動全體退職，尤為本八所富感謝。誠以此種友好精神之表示，不僅促成上海市政之統一，且於中日眞職合作，發生極深刻之影響，顯為中國方面設想，以上海市政問題之複雜，本國技術人才之不易羅致，日籍技衛人員，殊有繼續留用之必要。因此商准陳市長後，決定重聘三十餘人在木署服務，此後市政之推行，仍能或得日籍專家之臂助，此則不僅為中國方面所當引為偷快，想亦為友邦人士所樂予贊助者也。余願紫此機會向集經自六月至十日起被區公署解職之日藉，及其他外籍職員，寄以</p>
<h3>深厚同情</h3>
<p>對於彼等過去忠於職守之精神，丈表示非常欽佩。深信彼等去職以後，在精神上仍能與本署發生密切聯緊，同時希望社會方面，對於本署人事之調整，能予以深切之認識，並盼署內本國職員，無論其職務有皺重之別，益能振作精神，潔身目好，同為上海巿政而努力，庶幾百年來遺留之租界形態及其實做，卒能消滅於無形，此則不僅符合本人之顯望，抑亦陳市長建設新上海之最重要一端也</p>
<h3>市商會　理監事就職</h3>
<p>上海特別是商會，於昨（七月一日）下午四時，在妝會大禮堂舉行新任理監事宣誓就職典禮。市府經濟局特指派科長吳詛聞蒞會監誓，計出席者有聞蘭亭，林康候等二十餘人，公推裴雲卿為臨時主席，行禮如儀，全體理監事宣誓就職後，即舉行第一次理監事聯席會議。互選袁履登·寨潤蜘·金宗城·謝筱初·沈維挺·潘旭昇·何五良等七人為常務理事，聞蘭亭·裴雲卿·王伯元·林康候·吳蘊齊五人為常務監事，並選舉袁履登為理事長，聞蘭亭為監事長，並定於七月六日開第一次常務理監事聯席會州縱。</p>
<h3>節約協會今晚　任雲鵬廣播</h3>
<p>上海特別市節約協會，今（二日）為第二十次演講，該會鑒於市民節約宴會施行細則，方由巿府公佈，實有剴切解釋，以期貫澈之必要。爰由該會理事兼副書記長任雲鵬親自廣播，題為「如何督促戰時市民節約宴會的實行」，請各界注意收聽。</p>
<h3>記者例會</h3>
<p>巿宣傳處於昨日下午二時牛在市府二樓會驟識室舉行第十七次記者例會，出席各報社通執社記者，曁各機州關代表　餘人。茲彙錄各問題及答覆如下：</p>

<h3>配布商在貨不充</h3>
<p>中華日報社問：本巿棉布開始配給後，每有許多類似攤販之小型布店，竟亦享受配給權利，存貨極少，難應市民當求，購布人數稍多，即感擁擠不堪，似此情形，未知當局有無辦法，加以改善？經濟局答：查此次棉布配不堪，似此情形，未知當局有無辦法，加以改著？普濟局答：支此次綿布配給指定商，係由商統會商同該業同業公會負責辦理，本局並未參加意見，至小型布店存貨不充，以及擁擠情形，可由市民據實檢舉，當轉函商統會設法加以改善。</p>

<p>本報科學將近委員會首次核准補助金沈霽春君獲補助硏究費六萬元</p>
<p>本報科學獎金委員會成立後，陸續收到聲請獎金函件八起。其尃門成績部份正在審査中；其補助硏究部份，經委員會核准者，為沈　春君。沈君硏究主題及硏究方法，均符合科學硏究獎勵章程。其髒究已在進行中，實騐室亦有相當設備，故進行更為使利。茲經決議補助硏究費用國幣六萬元。沈君係比利時圖城大學生物學博士，曾從海受敎授（得一九三〇年諾貝　奘金）硏究三年·現任上海東亞工學院研究員，平素發表論文已有三十餘抓。茲將其硏究計劃錄下：</p>
<p>研究計劃腦下線中黑胞擴張素之研究及其對手治療中國人中白斑症患者之應用</p>
<p>應用黑胞擴張素溶液以治療療中國人中之白長症（俗名白點瘋）患者之嘗試——動物的驟下腺，尤其是腦下腺的佝葉，能分泌一種激素，經過這激素之處理後，甲殼類魚類兩權類爬虫類等等動物之皮膚內黑色粒細胞，即擴張成網狀，而其皮色，亦變作漆黑，凡此種種，均係已知事實，這種抓激素，孜們簡稱之為黑胞擴張素。雖則這種激素對于上述的各種動物的生物適應方面，厥功甚偉，但于治療疾病方面之功效，研究尙屬不多。依晚近法人傳業靄氏及其同事之報吿，彼輩曾應用黑胞擴張素溶液，治療人類的自斑症，獲得異常成助。雖則他們曾將提取道類激素的手續，詳細發表，依本人經鑿，現時上海自斑症之患者，亦時有所見，故擬作以下的實騐嘗試，先以施氏法，從牛腦下腺裏，提取黑胞擴張素，復州祝法令激素之作用加强，冀望願州極小量的黑胞擴張素落劑之注射，即有愈口國人中自斑症患者之藥效。</p>
<p>黑胞擴張素的作用，經過鹼的處理後，即得加張的原因！經過氫氧化鈉或氫氧化鉀之處理後，黑胞擴張素的作用，就會大大的增高，這現象已有不少人報吿過，在本人以前的工作裹，亦已說過，齡之增强黑胞擴張素之力量，約在二十五倍左右，雖則結果異常明顯，但對于所以加强的原因，至今尙無確定的解釋。我們現擬應用割除掉腦下腺的蛙與蟾綜，作為硏究的對象，以各種不同的方法，以探求這種鹼之所以加强黑胞擴張素的原因。</p>
<p>亞洲蟾蜍之視丘下部是不是一個能分泌黑胞擴張素的器官？日本狹間氏於一九三一年曾著渚文云：從分泌黑胞擴張素的一點來講，亞洲蟾蜍之視丘下部，其作用與腦下腺相似，因為當視丘下部一旦接受到機械刺激時，黑胞擴張素的分泌，突然增加，而動物皮色亦變成漆黑。但依本人過去經騐，以及現時初步觀察，覺得把這類動物視丘下部區，認為能分泌黑胞擴張素之構造的假設，似難成立，某「種構造，是不是具備某種機能？」至少從純粹動物生理學方面着想，是一個極其質要的問題，所以我們擬繼緻應用各種不同的技術與方法，來求得最後的答案：究竟亞洲蟾蜍之視丘下部是不是一個內分泌器官？</p>
<p>上項計劃約需七八個月之時間，硏究結果當再在本報發表。</p>

<h3>櫻與錨（一）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>第二天早晨，眞人回到橫須賀後，隆夫頗有　然若失之感。</p>
<p>（他這個做伙，完全成人了……）</p>
<p>與往昔在天保山　遮玩時，具有同樣成　，高談關論，同時，隆夫不時試探光明磊落的眞人所州鍊成的心。並不夜郞自大而且和　可親的眞人這抓態度，固屬與往昔沒有區別，但其精神中却隱現着未來的偉大，這倒使隆夫大吃一驚。已往，眞人固然像哥哥一樣，但此次這樣的執熱程度，却從未見過。眞人毫不隱韓，鞠誠相見，而公開出生活的各方面，於是引起隆夫的興致來，而說：</p>
<p>「海軍究竟是否有意與美國作戰？」眞人突然轉向他說：</p>
<p>「這類事情，像我縱樣人是不知道的。但你的畫…」</p>
<p>這樣一句話，就把話支開了。</p>
<p>（呵，對了，那個做伙已經成為軍人了。）</p>
<p>隆夫認為這是很明顯的事。而又想到，五年的期裝，竟使二人製生極大的懸殊，但這並沒有使他感覺寂寞。</p>
<p>總之，眞人給隆夫遺留下的印像，非常好，值得玩味。</p>
<p>其後過了四五天，從橫須質收到了一張明信片，說請到艦上來玩一次。隆夫非常的高興，手舞足踏，而立刻答應赴約。</p>
<p>在港務部前而等候的眞人，已經不是西服革履的便裝了。作着少尉軍衣，戴着白手套施行舉手禮，賺夫感覺到與在銀座碰到的時候，身材，面影，輪廓，都好像絕然不同的兩個人了。</p>
<p>（眞雄壯！我鎮羨慕！）</p>
<p>他很久沒有重溫這樣痴想的舊課了。</p>
<p>不到數分鐘後，隆夫就成了破題兒第一遭的艦上客了。雖然這是暫時的，夢幻般的「艦上客」，但與往昔的宿皺不同的意義上，他對於這種遭遇，是歡天喜地的。具有海軍畫家意　的他，登艦橋，行甲板，同時眺望港內所有艦艇。雖是碇泊中的緻艇，但其中的人們也都在忙忙碌碌地勞動着。在其他軍艦上，喇叭也嘹喨地響徹雲霄，信號手旗也在上下左右地揮動着。</p>
<p>隆夫心曠神怡，而陶醉於海軍的執準裏了。最後，被引到士官次室，請吃紅茶和點心。於是也曉得了海軍的胃口。但味道對於隆夫並不十分驚奇，而感到特殊味道者，却是在艦上被介紹出來的責年士官的而龐和談吐，都帶着無法形容的豪爽。士官次室裏的空氣，或許是最具有壯軍味道的。</p>
<p>（我往昔喜歡「海軍」，眞一點也沒錯。）</p>
<p>隆夫對於自已的命運，巳經沒有什麽可後悔的了。（一一〇）</p>

<h3>Weekly Commentary: On Deformed Politics</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Deformed politics can be said to be pathological politics. Whenever a nation is on the brink of rise and fall, extinction and continuation, the old social order, morality, and laws are all torn and broken, while the new social order, morality, and laws have not yet been established. Thus, in this "derailed" moment of the old and new, the entire society is insane, the people's psychology is abnormal, the nation's political measures are perverse, and daily economic life is extremely difficult. Everything that is heard and seen, every department, every class, every corner, almost without exception, displays extremely serious pathology. The so-called corrupt officials, dirty bureaucrats, treacherous merchants, and powerful magnates are the "progeny" produced under these various pathologies. The so-called ethical tragedies of "sons murdering their fathers and younger brothers killing their elder brothers" are therefore not surprising, and "the superiors have no moral compass, and the inferiors have no laws to obey" is a precise description of the political characteristics of this era.</p>
<p>China's three thousand years of history have often been marked by minor chaos every thirty years and major chaos every fifty years. The so-called "chaos" is the full exposure of deformed politics. And the prosperous eras lauded by historians, such as the rule of Wen and Jing in the Han Dynasty and the governance of Zhenguan in the Tang Dynasty, were times when deformed politics vanished without a trace. In this cycle of order and chaos, mutually causing each other, the general trend of the world is hard to escape the natural law of "unity after prolonged division, and division after prolonged unity." What is bitter is that the people have very few opportunities to live in times of political prosperity, and they spend more time suffering under deformed politics. There are many reasons for this. Sometimes it can be said to be due to having people to govern but no methods of governance, sometimes it can be said to be due to having governance by punishment but no governance by people, and sometimes it can even be said to be due to lacking both governance by people and governance by methods. Thus, people have no choice but to be manipulated by their miserable fate.</p>
<p>Deformed politics, analyzed in detail, what kind of phenomena are they? Let's use a passage to illustrate: In the third year of Changxing of the Later Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties, Kang Cheng, the Junior Minister of Dali, wrote to Emperor Mingzong:</p>
<p>"There are five things a nation need not fear, and six things that are deeply to be feared: Imbalance of yin and yang is not to be feared, the three rebellions failing to take place is not to be feared, slanderous words of petty people are not to be feared, the collapse of weaving and the drying up of rivers are not to be feared, insect pests damaging crops are not to be feared; hiding away of virtuous people is deeply to be feared, shifting of occupations of the four classes of people is deeply to be feared, collusion between superiors and inferiors is deeply to be feared, the demise of integrity and shame is deeply to be feared, the confusion of praise and blame is deeply to be feared, honest words not being heard is deeply to be feared. The things not to be feared, I hope Your Majesty will acknowledge but not act on, and the things deeply to be feared, I hope Your Majesty will rectify and not neglect."</p>
<p>The hiding away of virtuous people, the shifting of occupations of the four classes of people, collusion between superiors and inferiors, the demise of integrity and shame, the confusion of praise and blame, and honest words not being heard – these six things, if combined, constitute the epitome of deformed politics. Originally, virtuous people should be in the court wielding power, otherwise, it is impossible to achieve "the way of the gentlemen grows, and the way of the petty people wanes." If they cherish their reputation, self-righteously claiming purity and refusing to jump into the fire pit, and instead choose to be hermits in the mountains and forests, that is a deformed phenomenon. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants should each uphold their profession and abide by their duties. If civil servants concurrently run businesses for profit, primary school teachers change to pulling rickshaws due to economic pressure, or parvenus suddenly want to experience being officials, and thus spend money, find connections, and bribe their way, by any means necessary, to achieve their goals, that is a social pathology. Furthermore, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation; if the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish." If one disregards integrity and shame, and despite being laughed at, continues to be a corrupt official, what kind of world is this! As for superiors and inferiors colluding and colluding to cheat, confusing right and wrong, unclear rewards and punishments, acting perversely, and rejecting honest advice, imagine if a nation truly reached such a state, the suffering of the people would be unspeakable.</p>
<p>Therefore, after every major chaos in history, there is often a short or long period of prosperity. Although it is said that a nation's order and chaos are a cyclical formula, if we can do more to eliminate the various factors of deformed politics from all aspects, at least correcting the six points that are deeply to be feared, the suffering of the people in dire straits will gradually decrease. Reducing the suffering of the people means that the nation's politics and social order are on the right track. Advancing along this path, from a small state of well-being to the realm of great harmony, is by no means a extravagant hope. But we must remember: human history is created, don't let ruthless fate forever dominate, don't always passively accept and let nature take its course, especially in this current era of turmoil, don't fail the mission we should shoulder.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Responds Vigorously: Sinks Many Enemy Warships, Shoots Down Over 200 Aircraft in Ten Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on July 1st: On June 24th, Japanese aircraft intercepted an enemy mobile force heading north in the sea south of the Ogasawara Islands, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers and two unidentified warships, and shooting down over 55 enemy aircraft. 46 Japanese aircraft did not return. Japanese aircraft responded vigorously to the defense of the Mariana Islands, repelling enemy aircraft in repeated engagements, and are still attacking enemy positions and warships in the vicinity of Saipan Island. The confirmed results of battles from June 20th to 30th are as follows: Sank one enemy battleship, two cruisers, two destroyers, two transport ships; Damaged two aircraft carriers, two destroyers, five transport ships; Shot down 211 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - During the fighting in the Mariana Islands region from June 11th to 30th (20 days), the following results were achieved: According to investigations, a total of 36 enemy ships were sunk or damaged, including one battleship sunk, two aircraft carriers sunk, two cruisers sunk, one destroyer sunk, and one submarine sunk. One battleship sunk or damaged, five or more aircraft carriers sunk or damaged, six battleships damaged, six aircraft carriers damaged, five cruisers damaged, nine transport ships damaged, and one ship of unspecified type damaged. As of June 10th, over 400 enemy aircraft had been shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific, the Japanese Air Force continued to bomb enemy positions on Saipan Island from late night on June 30th to the morning of July 1st. All bombs hit their targets, and fires broke out in two places near the airfield. All aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Air Force formations repeatedly raided Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island from the night of the 20th to the morning of the 1st, causing fires to break out in several places. The flames soared into the sky and could be seen even from Tinian Island.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from Pearl Harbor, the Nimitz Headquarters announced on the 30th that the casualties since the start of the US landing operation on Saipan Island have reached 9,751.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Three US cruisers (or large destroyers) attacked Ominato Island on the 10th, shelling the vicinity of the airfield. The Japanese troops stationed there immediately engaged and fought fiercely, eventually repelling them.</p>
<h3>Hengyang City: Chongqing Army Resists Fiercely, Japanese Army Attacks from Three Directions</h3>
<p>Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st - After the Japanese army besieged Hengyang, they launched a final fierce offensive from three directions against the Chongqing army and the 10th Division and Provisional 54th Division resisting stubbornly in the city since the morning of the 29th. The Chongqing army, attacked simultaneously by the Japanese army from the northwest and northeast, has had its retreat cut off and is fiercely resisting, launching a vigorous defense. Especially in the south of the city, centered around numerous lakes, the Chongqing army's counter-offensive is extremely fierce. The Japanese army is also attacking them, and fierce fighting continued until the 30th. It is reported that a portion of the Chongqing army could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, set fire to the city, causing a corner of the city to be engulfed in black smoke and reduced to ashes. Also, the Yuehan railway bridge over the Xiang River outside Hengyang has been destroyed.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Japanese Army's Capture of Hengyang</h3>
<p>Hengyang Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from a war correspondent on the situation of the capture of Hengyang: Hengyang is now on the eve of falling into encirclement. At this moment of final resistance, the reporter is sending the first dispatch amidst the booming of artillery fire. We crossed the Xiang River (about 10 kilometers southeast of Hengyang) on the morning of the 27th. In the afternoon, we broke into the southern suburbs of Hengyang (3 kilometers from the city). A month has passed since the start of the operation, enduring the summer heat and wading through muddy terrain, traversing a path of 800 kilometers. The important military stronghold of the Chongqing army has appeared before us. The Xiang River washes before the city, and flames soar in several places within the city, forming a continuous stretch of black smoke with the wounded on the opposite bank, covering the sky. All the hills are filled with fortifications, and the slopes of the hills are dug with anti-tank ditches as deep as six meters, winding around. Through the gun holes in the fortifications, one can see the crisscrossing Japanese communication trenches all over the ground, leading to unknown places. The elite Japanese troops began a fierce attack at noon on that day, and are now in a situation of breaking into the city. After the Japanese army occupied the hills, they immediately installed artillery and began shelling. Outside the suburbs, there is a modern electric power plant that even we dream of. When the Chongqing army's land forces coordinate with the US army stationed in Chongqing, they appear in the sky above the battlefield. On June 23rd, an order was given for the citizens to evacuate, and not a single person remained, all retreated completely. Therefore, not even a child can be seen, and every household is tightly closed, with signs of looting everywhere on the streets. The Chongqing army has four mountain guns and mortars, etc. Shells are flying everywhere. The battle for Hengyang city is becoming increasingly fierce in the evening.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks and Enters Xiangxiang</h3>
<p>Hunan Front Line of the Japanese Army, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - A certain unit of the Japanese army that completely captured Ningxiang on the 15th can be called an iron-footed unit. The unit launched an annihilation war against the Chongqing 74th Army retreating south of Ningxiang. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Xiangxiang. A part of the Chongqing Fourth Group Army mistakenly believed that the Japanese army was launching a major offensive against Changsha, and attempted to retake Ningxiang. However, a certain unit of the Japanese army launched a major encirclement operation around the Chongqing army on the route between Ningxiang and Xiangxiang. On the 19th, they completely annihilated 400 Chongqing troops near Baozifeng and 2,600 Chongqing troops with guns and horses near Zhuziqiao, and closely pursued Xiangxiang. The Chongqing 24th Army still offered final resistance, but after a sudden attack by the Japanese army, the Japanese army entered Xiangxiang from the forward positions west of Xiangtan on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Active in the Skies Over Hunan</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese Front Line Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army's operation since the invasion of Changsha and Hengyang has been swift. In recent days, the skies over Hunan have been densely covered with clouds, and it has been raining continuously, but the Japanese ground troops and reconnaissance and attack units have not rested for a single day due to the rain, and have continued to attack the Chongqing army. At the same time, the Japanese air force units have been providing cover from above. In the adverse weather of rain, they fly low along the Xiang River towards Hengyang. When the base-bound units return to base, they resemble water rats. If they receive attack orders again, they repeatedly attack the Chongqing army. Therefore, the Chongqing army's ground troops feel boundless terror towards the Japanese air force's dive bombers, which come in large formations even in rainy weather.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Chongqing telegrams, Japanese air force units bombed the entrances and exits of the eastern coast of Fujian Province and Sandu'ao on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds Over Lingling</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese Military Base, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese aircraft raided the US Air Force base in Lingling, Chongqing, on the 26th, engaging in a fierce aerial battle. After receiving orders from the unit commander, the green Japanese fighter formation immediately took off. Upon arriving in Lingling on the 11th, they discovered two Chongqing-US aircraft at high altitude and immediately engaged in aerial combat. More than 40 Chongqing-US aircraft participated in the battle. The Japanese aircraft immediately concentrated their forces and launched a surprise attack. They shot down a Chongqing-US (P40) type aircraft, completing the initial attack and scattering the Chongqing-US aircraft formation. The two sides then entered a mixed battle state. After 40 minutes of fierce fighting, they shot down ten Chongqing-US aircraft. The commander then ordered a disengagement, but the Chongqing-US aircraft, seeing the Japanese aircraft intending to return, launched a fierce attack with their pursuing formation. The aerial battle remained extremely fierce. The Japanese aircraft fought and retreated, and the aerial battle ended only over Yongfeng (70 kilometers northwest of Hengyang).</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Raids Pingjiang, Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese new sharp fighter aircraft team discovered a US Air Force Curtiss P-40 aircraft and a North American P-51 aircraft stationed in Chongqing, invading the southern airspace of Pingjiang (Hunan Province) on the evening of the 29th. They immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy attempted to retreat south, and they were fiercely attacked in succession over the airspace approximately 30 kilometers southwest of Changsha, pursuing at an ultra-low altitude. At this time, several enemy P-40 and P-51 aircraft attacked from high altitude. The Japanese aircraft immediately counterattacked in a low-altitude posture.

<h3>Japanese Army Launches Concentrated Attack on the West Side of the Nujiang River, Main Force of the Chongqing Army Encircled</h3>
<p>Nujiang Front Line, a certain Japanese Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army on the west side of the Nujiang River, seeing the main force of the Chongqing 79th Army's 87th Division cross the Nujiang River and fiercely attack Mengchangjie, launched a concentrated attack against them. On the 24th, they broke through several Chongqing army positions. Subsequently, the main force of the Chongqing army was surrounded northwest of Xiaosongshu. Although the Chongqing army made a stubborn counterattack, it was repelled by the Japanese army. The Chongqing army has lost about 1,500 troops. The Japanese army is still continuing its annihilation in the area. The Chongqing army abandoned a large number of corpses, ammunition, and weapons. It is reported that the Chongqing army had high expectations for the 87th Division during the second counterattack across the Nujiang River. However, the Chongqing 87th Division's attempt to recapture Longling suffered great losses in strength due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, and fell into great chaos.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Zhejiang Occupies Tangxi and Longyou, Completing the Opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army in the Jinhua area of ​​eastern Zhejiang launched operations at dawn on June 9th, and then advanced in several directions into the plains and the Huangzhong mountain range of eastern Zhejiang. In just a few days, they secured Tangxi and Longyou, strongholds of the Chongqing Third War Zone. On the evening of the 18th, they broke through the double lines of defense on the east side of the Wuxi River, which were the key points for defending Quzhou. The vanguard of the Japanese army then crossed the Wuxi River on the evening of the 19th and controlled Quzhou, the military hub of the Chongqing army, shocking the Chongqing army in the Third War Zone.</p>
<p>A certain Military Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army, like a surging wave, swept away the Chongqing army around Dongting Lake. The Japanese army is now launching operations in the Jinlan area of ​​eastern Zhejiang to echo the Dongting Lake strategy. At present, the elite Japanese troops have boldly advanced towards the plains and Huangshan mountain range of eastern Zhejiang in a fan-shaped formation, capturing the easternmost stronghold of the Chongqing Third War Zone, Tangxi area, and securing Longyou. Thus, the Japanese army has completed the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, and trapped the Chongqing 23rd Army Commander Dian Shizun's 12th Division and the 25th Army Wei Lijue's 7th Division, as well as two teams of the International Commando force, who escaped Hong Kong under British command last year, totaling about 10,000 troops, into a tragic situation. On the 9th before dawn, the Japanese army launched operations and moved into the Huangshan mountain range, launched a search and destroy mission against the Chongqing 49th Army's search team, and carried out an attack. They engaged in battle with the International Commando force's second team, which was in progress. On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese army advanced to the vicinity of Quanyouzhen, about 20 kilometers southwest of Longyou. Currently, various units of the Japanese army are carrying out bloody battles against the Chongqing 26th Division and a part of the 147th Division, and are advancing westward. The Japanese army's successful landing in front of the enemy at Baisha River, 10 kilometers west of Jinhua, has been announced. Its main force, pressing against the Chongqing 49th Army's 26th Division and the 105th Division, broke into the Chongqing army's stronghold, Tangxi, at 4:00 PM on the 10th. After a short rest, they urgently pursued the defeated Chongqing army and continued to advance west, targeting Longyou, the Chongqing army's second stronghold, for attack. Before dawn on the 12th, they successfully broke in. Thereupon, various units of the Japanese army echoed each other, and are continuing to mop up the remaining enemies.</p>
<h3>Guilin Begins Evacuation of Population</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Chongqing Guangxi Provincial Government authorities, in view of the perilous situation, began a large-scale evacuation of the population in the Guilin area. The local newspapers in Guilin all followed the instructions from the bombing of Chongqing in 1940, and from July 1st, the newspapers have stopped publishing separately and have changed to issuing a common edition. The printing factories and machinery have now been moved to other locations that can continue to operate. The highways and roads of Hunan and Guangxi provinces are filled with refugees retreating from the battle areas.</p>
<h3>New Chief of Liaison Department of the Japanese Army in Hankou Takes Office</h3>
<p>Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - After Mr. Ochiai Teigo, the Chief of Liaison Department of the Allied Forces in Hankou, was honorably transferred to an important position in Manchuria, the newly appointed Chief Mr. Ishino arrived in Hankou some days ago and took office. Yesterday, he visited various Sino-Japanese agencies to pay his respects. It is reported that Mr. Ishino visited the provincial government by ship at 2:00 PM on the 30th, where he was personally received by Governor Yang, and he visited various departments and bureaus until 5:00 PM before returning to Hankou. He also visited the municipal government on the 1st and had his first conversation with the staff of the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Administrative Inspection Regulations Revised by the Regular Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>——New Participating Commissioners Carefully Selected——</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to increase administrative efficiency, the Japanese government designated approximately 300 commissioners from members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, as well as respected figures from the private sector, to establish a commissioner system to assist in official duties within the Cabinet and various ministries. Since the implementation of the system three years ago, they have spared no effort in conducting various investigations entrusted by the ministers and assisting the ministries in the advancement of policies and the dissemination of national policies. Currently, the term of office for each commissioner has expired after two years. Taking this opportunity, the government decided to abolish the system and establish a new participating commissioner system within the Cabinet and various ministries. The total number of commissioners will be significantly reduced (approximately halved). The commissioners will directly participate in important general affairs. The increased activity of administrative inspections in various departments is expected to lead to anticipated progress. Based on these measures, at the regular Cabinet meeting on the 30th, the Cabinet and the participating commissioner system of various ministries, along with the administrative inspection regulations, were revised and implemented on the 2nd with official gazette announcements. According to the partial revisions to the administrative inspection regulations, administrative inspection commissioners are established in addition to the existing administrative inspectors. In order to make the administrative inspection system more thorough and comprehensive, new administrative inspection commissioners are appointed in addition to the high-ranking officials in various departments and bureaus. In the past, the participation of members of parliament in administrative issues was a lingering problem. Most members of parliament held that there was no legal basis for this, as members of parliament were not officials and were not suitable for the political system. Since then, a comprehensive administrative inspection system has been implemented, showing a great effect. Wartime administrative efficiency operations and the talents of parliamentary members will soon be unleashed. The government is carefully conducting the selection of the new participating commissioners, and they are expected to be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle for Caen, German Elite Switch to Offensive, US Troops Concentrated in Southern Cotentin Peninsula</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - As British troops attempted to capture the city of Caen and began their offensive, German troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack with the Hitler Youth Division and other elite forces. According to a telegram from London, the Anti-Axis High Command's communiqué on the 30th also acknowledged this fact as follows: The enemy troops in the Tilly area have switched to an offensive in the past 48 hours, and fierce fighting is currently underway between the two sides. In this battle, German troops that had not been deployed before have also joined the fighting.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Führer's headquarters announced on the 30th: The Anti-Axis forces attempted to cut off the supply line to the city of Caen and to occupy the city from the southwest. Under the cover of strong artillery and air force, they broke through the town's battle line, but were counterattacked by strong German troops. The enemy forces lost most of the territory they had gained and had many tanks destroyed. Fierce fighting continues. East of the Orne River and southwest of Tilly, the Anti-Axis forces launched offensives under the cover of strong artillery, but were repelled by the German troops. US troops advanced southeast of Saint-Lô, but were immediately repelled by German troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - DNB News Agency reports: Yesterday morning, US troops attacked the German defense forces in Cherbourg with large numbers of infantry and tanks. The German artillery there was an obstacle to Anti-Axis warships entering Cherbourg Harbor. Therefore, the US troops first bombarded with artillery, and then attacked with infantry and tank columns. Until last night, the German defense forces fiercely resisted, and all the artillery fired to bombard the US troops advancing towards Cherbourg Beaumont and Hague Point, and another team advanced north from Mauville, protected by a large number of aircraft. The US troops in the southern Cotentin Peninsula are concentrated north of Saint-Lô and south of Carentan. Military sources believe that this concentration of large forces is a prelude to the Anglo-American forces expanding their bridgehead to the south.</p>
<h3>Focus of Eastern Front War Shifts to Berezina Region, Street Fighting Unfolds in Slutsk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - DNB News Agency reports: The Soviet summer offensive, which has been underway for a week, shifted to the Berezina region on Thursday. The northern wing of the offensive has advanced to Slutsk, which is on the same line as Minsk. The vanguard of the Red Army tank columns advancing southwest from Vitebsk has reached the vicinity of Lepiel. Strong German troops are conducting successful resistance by launching flanking attacks against the center of the Soviet offensive near the Berezina River. Between Orsha and Minsk, extremely fierce battles are taking place on the highway near Borisov. Small Soviet units have established two bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the Berezina River upstream of Borisov, but they were soon cleared. The Soviet army dispatched particularly strong tank and infantry detachments to fiercely attack the southwest wing of Polotsk, attempting to defeat the right wing of the northern wing. Although the German defenders moved their southern wing back several kilometers, they finally contained the enemy's breakthrough attempt in fierce fighting.</p>

<h3>France Takes Measures to Protect Cabinet Members' Safety</h3>
<p>Paris, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – According to today's news, following the assassination attempt on French Information Minister Henriot, the cabinet resolved during Thursday's cabinet meeting to take measures to ensure the safety of French cabinet members. Ministers Darnand and Déat, who have been repeatedly threatened by London broadcasts, are in particular need of protection.

<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – On the 30th, the French government, presided over by Chief Laval, held a full cabinet meeting at the Quai d'Orsay Hotel in Paris to discuss important matters.

<p>US Official Announces Severing of Relations with Finland; Switzerland to Represent US Interests in Finland</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency Urgent Dispatch, 1st – Washington officials announced yesterday that the United States has severed diplomatic relations with Finland. Secretary of State Hull has already notified the Finnish Plenipotentiary Representative. According to a Huitong News Agency report from Washington, the US State Department announced when severing foreign relations with Finland that the US authorities have instructed the chargé d'affaires in Finland to request passports for himself and his staff from the Finnish government. It was also stated that the Finnish government had, on June 27th, acknowledged engaging in a strenuous war in conjunction with Germany. In light of this, Finland's actions directly impede the anti-Axis war effort, and the United States can no longer maintain diplomatic relations with Finland.</p>
<p>Helsinki, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – The Finnish Information Bureau formally announced on Friday evening that the US Chargé d'Affaires in Finland notified the Finnish Foreign Minister at 6:00 PM on Friday that the US government had decided to sever diplomatic relations with Finland and requested the Swiss government to represent US interests in Finland.</p>
<h3>German-Finnish Agreement Strengthens Cooperation</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry commented on the German-Finnish agreement, stating that the spirit of common combat between the two peoples is now based on solid political principles.</p>
<p>Berlin, China News Agency Dispatch, 1st – According to Huitong News Agency: The recently signed German-Finnish agreement does not affect Finland's neutrality or domestic policies. This is the statement of a Finnish Foreign Ministry official. The claim made by England, America, and Sweden that Finland's democratic politics and sovereignty have been completely destroyed since the signing of the German military aid agreement with Finland is thus refuted. Germany has not manipulated the Finnish parliament, and in the current situation, it is not surprising that Germany and Finland are acting jointly in military and political matters.</p>
<h3>Swedish-Finnish Political Parties Sever Relations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – German News Agency reports: Local newspapers published a headline today stating that since the Finnish Social Democratic Party could not withdraw from the Finnish government, it effectively supported the German-Finnish agreement. Therefore, the Swedish Social Democratic Party will sever its relations with it. This is a de facto severance of relations, but not a formal one. The social democratic parties of Sweden and Finland are no longer willing to cooperate closely.</p>
<h3>Buzz Bombs Continuously Strike England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – According to a Reuters report from London: German buzz bombs flew over southern England from the night of the 29th to the 30th at regular intervals, causing many casualties.</p>
<p>Balloon Barrage</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – German News Agency reports: German sentries along the Channel coast observed more than 120 large balloons rising to a height of 2,000 to 3,000 meters around the entrances to London, presumably to defend against Germany's "V1" aircraft.</p>
<p>Lost Children</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – German News Agency reports: The British Ministry has begun a large-scale evacuation of children. The same sources say that the British government expects Germany to intensify its buzz bomb attacks on England soon.</p>
<p>Launching Situation</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – A certain officer in charge of the German buzz bomb operation recently told our agency the following points about this new weapon: these explosive bombs are launched from underground facilities, and these underground facilities are particularly safe, not threatened by heavy artillery or air raids; their safety can be said to be very reliable. This weapon can be regarded as an unmanned aircraft, with a speed of 600 kilometers per hour, and its flight power is a rocket. The head of the aircraft is a new type of explosive bomb weighing one thousand kilograms, and its explosive power is far greater than anything used before. Its range of activity is determined before launch and depends on the thrust of its rocket.</p>
<h3>Tito Assumes Command of Yugoslav Army</h3>

As for the question of the Yugoslav king's return to the country, it will be decided by a national referendum. It is not yet known whether King Peter has accepted this agreement.</p>
<h3>Philippine Ambassador to Japan Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – Philippine Ambassador to Japan, Vargas, returned to his country on May 14th to discuss important matters. It is now learned that the ambassador arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 1st via Fukuoka.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Army Receives American-Style Training; Each Division Assigned American Officers</h3>
<p>A certain base on the Hunan Front, 29th – In the Hunan offensive operation launched by the Japanese army, Xue Yue's Ninth War Area under Chongqing's command has been besieged by the Japanese army and has lost a large number of troops. The Japanese army, which attacked the 37th Army under the jurisdiction of the Ninth War Area, captured Chongqing army prisoners in Liuyang and during a river crossing. According to their statements, it is known that the army has been completely trained in the American style. The 37th Army, composed of the 60th and 96th divisions directly under Chongqing's command and the Sichuan army, has about ten American officers assigned to each division. Before the American-style training was completed, it encountered the Japanese army's offensive. This is a manifestation of the American army's enslavement of the Chongqing army to establish an offensive base against Japan on the Chinese mainland and to attack the Japanese mainland from the air and land. At the same time, Chongqing, which has become an orphan in East Asia, disregards the United States' use of it and continues to wage a blind war of resistance. It is even more evident that Chiang Kai-shek's touted "China Firstism" is nothing more than a cover for this kind of treasonous behavior. After the Japanese army began its offensive, the Chongqing army was defeated in every battle and retreated repeatedly. American-style training has not been effective. By now, the Chongqing army should have experienced the reality of the American army. From these facts, it can be seen that the Japanese army's operation is aimed at crushing the Anglo-American attempt to launch a counteroffensive from the mainland, protecting Greater East Asia, and demonstrating its determination to continue fighting until the Anglo-American forces are destroyed.</p>

<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st – By order of the National Government, dated July 1st, Guo Xiufeng is appointed as a member of the National Economic Commission. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Aircraft Shot Down in Kitakyushu</h3>
<p>On the 16th of this month, enemy American aircraft raided the Kitakyushu area of Japan, and the Japanese air defense forces demonstrated their power and shot down many of them. The enemy's B-29 type giant bomber, known as the "Super Air Fortress," was touted by the enemy as absolutely invincible, but it was actually shot down by the Japanese army, greatly disheartening the enemy's air force. The crash site was in a rural area in Takasu, five kilometers north of Orio Town, Onga County, Fukuoka Prefecture. The reporter went to inspect and saw the truth of the wreckage.</p>
<p>The enemy's corpses, burned by heavy oil, were reduced to ashes, and a foul odor permeated the air. The B-29 type, loaded with a large number of bombs, was finally shot down. The huge fuselage, with a wingspan of 43 meters, a length of 30 meters, and a total weight of 40 tons, was shattered into pieces within a circular area of about 300 meters in diameter, from the foot of a small mountain to a wheat field. The bodies of more than a dozen enemy airmen were dismembered and scattered. Severed hands and feet and pieces of flesh could be seen on tree trunks or in the fields. The reporter could not help but exclaim: "They brought it upon themselves!"</p>
<p>One bomb made of two hundred catties of mountain explosives and one unexploded bomb were also found at the foot of the small mountain. Guarding officers shouted wildly: "Danger, danger; stay away!" Push-in machines, wheels, auxiliary fuel tanks, typewriters, etc. were scattered nearby. Two parachutes hung on tree branches, their colors incongruous with the local scenery. Among the items found in the enemy corpses' pockets was a strip of cloth passport with the words "China War Relief (American) Military-Civilian Joint Rescue Aviation Committee, No. 08535," Indian silver coins, Chongqing banknotes, a Chinese-American conversation dictionary, a map of a certain place, etc.</p>
<p>At this time, an officer of the Air Defense Force rushed to explain the situation of shooting down the enemy aircraft: "When the enemy aircraft was discovered coming from the south, searchlights were quickly used to illuminate it. Other units nearby also illuminated it, forming a cross-shaped illumination. Soon, a huge object was discovered. My subordinates shouted, 'Good, we've caught it!' At this time, the huge object was immediately attacked by fighter planes and hit by anti-aircraft shells. It swayed and tumbled downwards like a grinding cone. We saw that the aircraft type was a B-29..."</p>
<p>The Super Air Fortress, directly commanded by Enemy Air Force Chief Arnold, was shot down in this way.</p>
<p>According to a certain captain who inspected the wreckage at the scene: "The B-29 type enemy aircraft has a speed of 550 kilometers and a cruising range of 3,800 li. It boasted of high performance and grandeur, but it was shot down by us. The enemy's plan has been completely destroyed. Although the shot-down aircraft was indeed a B-29, it can still be recognized even though it was shattered into pieces. The killed American airmen carried Indian banknotes and currency, and maps and meteorological charts of the Bay of Bengal, which prove that they recently flew to China from India." (Translated from the June 19th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>The War Situation Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse. Japan Awaits the Opportunity to Defeat the Enemy. Talk by Mr. Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>…After the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the news of the American air raid on Kitakyushu on the afternoon of June 16th, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a senior member of the Japanese news media and a guest of the Mainichi Shimbun, also stated his thoughts at his private residence, Bansharu Sodo, in Izusan, Atami City:</p>
<p>…We need not be alarmed or worried. They are so-called moths flying into the flame, throwing themselves into the net. They are the perfect bait for our elite air force, for which we have been sighing for a chance to use.</p>
<p>…They have exhausted their efforts to establish bases in the Chongqing area to bomb our mainland, but they have been repeatedly thwarted. Moreover, with the fall of Luoyang, they have lost their foothold in 400 prefectures of China. Their plans are about to be completely destroyed by our air force. Not only that, but they are also being pressed by the Japanese army in Myanmar and India, which are most critical to them. At this time, the fall of Imphal, the heart of India, is only a matter of time. At this juncture, their actions of bombing Japan are all a means of deceiving the American people. I fear that they themselves have never really wanted to achieve anything. No matter how fine the fishing net, some fish are bound to escape. What effect can air raids that sneak through the mesh have?</p>
<p>…There is one more thing I want to say, and that is that the Anglo-Saxons are a barbarous and ignorant lot. Whatever we have not done and do not want to do, they do with shameless candor. Their attacks not only make no distinction between combatants and non-combatants, but even specialize in attacking non-combatants. When they bombed hospital ships, they cheered with delight! And like the culturally rich Rome, which our ally Germany had long declared a non-militarized city, they brazenly attacked it, sparing no effort to destroy thousands of years of civilization in one fell swoop. They even take pride in strafing schoolchildren! Our war with them is not a war against people, but a struggle against poisonous snakes and wild beasts.</p>
<p>…What I want to shout even more at this moment is that the German war situation has already begun to take a sharp turn for the worse due to the landing of the Anglo-American forces in northern France. And the war on both our land and sea sides is also undergoing a major transformation. This is what our 100 million people must be aware of. Why have we been enduring and restraining ourselves until now? It is because we have been lying low in order to wait for the moment to spread our wings and attack the enemy. I dare to shout that from now on, there will be a positive and major transformation on both the land and sea sides. We lift our heads and look forward to the great light of the future, waiting for the opportunity to come. That time is approaching every moment, and we must not be negligent at this moment. Negligence leads to failure. This is our motto. (Translated from the June 17th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Handover Ceremony Held for New and Former Chairmen of the Commercial Control Association; Lively Atmosphere at Lido Garden Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association held a handover ceremony for the new and former chairmen at Lido Garden on Taixing Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (July 1st). All directors, supervisors, staff members, guests from all walks of life, and newspaper reporters, totaling more than 500 people, attended. The atmosphere was lively, and the ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was as follows: Opening (omitted above), Former Chairman Tang takes his seat, Chairman Wen takes his seat, All directors and supervisors take their seats, Former Chairman Tang introduces Chairman Wen to all colleagues, All members of the Association stand up and bow to Chairman Wen, Former Chairman Tang delivers a speech, All members of the Association stand up and pay respects to Former Chairman Tang with a bow, Handing over the seal, Chairman Wen delivers a speech, Directors and supervisors deliver speeches, Ceremony concludes.</p>
<h3>Speech by Former Chairman Tang</h3>
<p>Former Chairman Tang said in his speech: Shoumin has meager talent and shallow ability. In March of the seventh year of the Republic, he reluctantly assumed the position of chairman of this association. To this day, it has been fifteen months. During this period, because the control of the economy is a pioneering undertaking in our country, all regulations and business implementations have relied on the collective efforts and enthusiastic assistance of all colleagues to avoid being truncated midway. The directors and supervisors are all leaders in their respective industries, and their experience has provided much guidance. Shoumin is deeply grateful for this. Today, Mr. Wen Chanting is taking over as the second chairman of the Commercial Control Association. Mr. Wen is a senior member of the business community and was originally the supervisor of this association. His high moral character and advanced age have long enjoyed widespread respect. There is no need for me to introduce him further. I only hope that under the leadership of Chairman Wen, all colleagues will be more diligent in their respective positions, so that the work of economic control will advance towards a brighter future, and not disappoint the expectations of the country and people. Then, I would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Speech by Chairman Wen</h3>
<p>Lanting is old and frail and cannot bear the burden of arduous tasks. As the chairman of the Cotton Control Association, I was hesitating and reluctant and was about to resign. Suddenly, the authorities assigned me to the position of chairman of the Commercial Control Association, which was completely beyond my expectations. I repeatedly declined. However, colleagues in the business community regard this association as an autonomous organization of the commercial sector. At this time when hundreds of things are being handled, they regard Lanting as an old horse who knows the way and urge me with righteousness. Lanting accepted the government's order and the urging of colleagues in the business community, and it was difficult to refuse. Lanting's decaying remaining life and the social care I have accumulated for a long time. Knowing that the future of the association's affairs is beyond Lanting's ability, but wanting the people's livelihood to have an inch of benefit, Lanting will firmly adhere to the position of a businessman, exhaust his ability, and sacrifice the small self. What is there to regret? Fortunately, there are leaders from various industries to assist. Former Chairman Zhan laid a good foundation for the work of state-controlled material paper industry in the past year. Lanting will naturally follow the old rules and accomplish the great task. I deeply hope that all colleagues will move forward with the spirit of the past and work hard to complete the government's policy of controlling materials and the expectations of colleagues in the business community. Lanting is deeply aware that his talent is shallow and his ability is limited, and he will eventually violate his original wish. When I return to my original position, I will never linger and delay and mislead the association's affairs. Although I may be seen as progressing quickly and retreating quickly, I will not refuse. At the beginning of my inauguration today, I respectfully offer my straightforward words as a resting place.</p>
<h3>Speech by Director Lin Kanghou</h3>
<p>Director Lin Kanghou said on behalf of all directors and supervisors: In the past year or so, under the leadership of Mr. Tang Shoumin, the Commercial Control Association has done its best in all aspects, and today's regulations are the result of his hard work, which cannot be denied. In the past, the work of the Commercial Control Association may not have been satisfactory due to environmental and organizational factors. However, we only seek to be free from guilt, and all successes and failures are not what we care about. The certificate issued by former Chairman Tang is labeled with the words "Impartiality, Honesty, and Integrity," which can be transferred to the new Chairman Wen. Old Wen is known for his integrity and uprightness. I hope that all colleagues will still maintain the association's motto of impartiality, honesty, and integrity, work in their respective positions, and assist the new chairman with the spirit of the past. Kanghou will temporarily serve as secretary-general this time because there is no suitable candidate for secretary-general, and will still defer to the more capable in the future.</p>
<h3>First District Public Office Dismisses Foreign Staff; Director Wu Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Wu Songgao, Director of the First District Public Office, gave a speech yesterday regarding the retirement of foreign staff, as follows: Since the administrative rights of the Shanghai Public Concession were returned to China last year, the original system of the Public Works Department has gradually changed. After the merger of the eight district public offices into the First District Public Office on February 1st of this year, in addition to maintaining the inherent administrative advantages, all laws and regulations of the Chinese National Government and the Chinese administrative system have been faithfully implemented and no effort has been spared to make the First District Public Office an important part of the Shanghai municipal government. In terms of personnel, there was no change in the staff at all levels when the Public Concession was returned, except for Chinese and Japanese staff. There were also staff from 21 different countries working in the First District Public Office. This kind of</p>
<h3>Unique Situation</h3>
<p>is rarely seen in modern municipal government agencies. How to make all staff members integrate and cooperate sincerely is obviously not easy. After the merger of the first and eighth districts, due to the integration of the same parts of the two districts, there was inevitably a redundancy of personnel. We re-allocated the responsibilities of all departments so that all staff members had their own responsibilities and did their best to ensure that administrative efficiency was not affected. Since February of this year, with the consent of Mayor Chen and with reference to the Chinese municipal system, I have implemented and strengthened the administrative structure of the district public office. The most important thing is to change all official documents from English to Chinese, and all other administrative procedures and organizations have been appropriately adjusted. The promotion of district affairs has been so successful because of the</p>
<h3>Sincere Assistance</h3>
<p>of the friendly Japanese authorities and the concerted cooperation of colleagues within the office, for which I am deeply grateful. Judging from the current situation, the complete unification of municipal government agencies is not far away. In the future, this public office may still need foreign staff to continue to serve in technical aspects, but because the current system has been uniformly adjusted, it is difficult for foreign staff who are not familiar with Chinese document procedures to be as competent as they were in the past and to exert their effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot reduce the number of the original two hundred Western staff by half.</p>
<h3>Dismiss Them</h3>
<p>and grant them the benefits they deserve upon retirement according to the service rules. Those who continue to be employed will still be guaranteed and use their talents to the fullest. All these measures are based on the Chinese administrative standpoint and should be understood by all parties. As for the Japanese staff working in this office, there are about 80 people. At a time when the Japanese authorities are making every effort to support China's independence,</p>
<h3>Japanese Personnel</h3>
<p>can understand the new situation between China and Japan and voluntarily resign en masse, which is especially appreciated by this office. The expression of this friendly spirit not only promotes the unification of Shanghai's municipal government, but also has a profound impact on the true cooperation between China and Japan. It is clearly for the sake of China. Given the complexity of Shanghai's municipal problems and the difficulty of recruiting domestic technical talents, it is still necessary to continue to employ Japanese technical staff. Therefore, after consulting with Mayor Chen, it was decided to re-employ more than 30 people to serve in this office. In the future, the promotion of municipal administration will still be able to obtain the assistance of Japanese experts. This is not only something that the Chinese side should be happy about, but also something that friendly people are happy to support. I would like to take this opportunity to express to the Japanese and other foreign staff who have been dismissed from the district public office since June 10th.</p>
<h3>Deep Sympathy</h3>
<p>and express my great admiration for their spirit of loyalty to their duties in the past. I firmly believe that they will still be closely linked to this office in spirit after they leave office. At the same time, I hope that the society can have a deep understanding of the adjustment of personnel in this office, and I hope that the domestic staff in the office, regardless of the importance of their duties, can be more energetic, clean and self-respecting, and work together for the Shanghai municipal government, so that the concession form and its reality left over for hundreds of years can eventually disappear without a trace. This is not only in line with my obvious hope, but also the most important aspect of Mayor Chen's construction of a new Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Reporter Meeting</h3>
<p>The City Propaganda Department held its 17th reporter meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall. Attending were reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as representatives from various government agencies, totaling over a dozen people. A summary of the questions and answers is as follows:</p>
<p>Questions and Answers on the Next Semester:</p>
<p>*Chung Hua Daily News:* The First District Education Branch has decided that tuition fees for primary and secondary schools next semester will be collected based on the rice price on August 1st. Given the current situation, it is feared that most parents will not be able to afford it, and the number of children dropping out of school will inevitably increase, seriously affecting the future of the nation. What effective remedial measures does the city government have in place?</p>
<p>*Education Bureau:* The government is considering ways to help parents with their financial burdens. Before a relief plan is decided, the bureau plans to submit a draft plan from the bureau's meeting for approval by the city government and implementation. The resolution from the first item of the bureau meeting is as follows: Based on the government's order approving the Ministry of Education's dispatch, provincial and municipal education bureaus should set standards for fees charged by public and private schools at all levels. The bureau should decide how to handle this matter this week. Resolution: To discuss this issue together with the third item and draft the maximum tuition fees for private schools: no more than 5,000 yuan for senior high schools, no more than 4,000 yuan for junior high schools, and no more than 3,000 yuan for primary schools for the entire semester. For municipal schools, tuition fees should not exceed 1,600 yuan for senior high schools, 1,300 yuan for junior high schools, and 1,000 yuan for primary schools for the entire semester. Furthermore, if schools charge for library and sports fees, these should not exceed 150 yuan each for secondary schools and 100 yuan each for primary schools. No other fees should be collected under any pretext. Departments two and three will jointly draft implementation measures, submit them for approval, and forward them to the city government and the Ministry of Education for implementation.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Goods for Distributors</h3>
<p>*Chung Hua Daily News:* Since the implementation of cotton cloth rationing in the city, many small cloth shops resembling street vendors also enjoy rationing rights. Their stock is extremely limited, making it difficult to meet the needs of citizens. When slightly more people come to buy cloth, the situation becomes extremely crowded. In light of this, does the authorities have any methods to improve the situation?</p>
<p>*Economic Bureau:* The designated cotton cloth distributors for this round of rationing were arranged by the Business Management Committee in consultation with the industry association. This bureau did not participate in the decision-making process. As for the small cloth shops' insufficient stock and crowding, citizens can report the facts to the Business Management Committee, which will be asked to find ways to improve the situation.</p>

<h3>Reader Assistance News</h3>
<p>Tiangong Charity Performance Aids Students: A letter from the Shanghai Special City Propaganda Department states: "To whom it may concern, the Tiangong Theater was previously ordered to cease performances because it staged inappropriate dramas that violated inspection regulations.

<p>The Science Award Committee of this newspaper approved a subsidy for the first time. Mr. Shen Jichun received a research grant of 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Science Award Committee of this newspaper, eight letters of application for awards were received successively. The specialized achievement parts are currently under review; the research subsidy part, which has been approved by the committee, is Mr. Shen Jichun. Mr. Shen's research topic and research methods are in line with the Science Research Award Regulations. His research is already in progress, and the laboratory has considerable equipment, so the progress is even more convenient. It has now been resolved to subsidize research expenses of 60,000 yuan in national currency. Mr. Shen is a Doctor of Biology from the University of Tuochen in Belgium, and studied under Professor Hai (winner of the 1930 Nobel Prize) for three years. He is currently a researcher at Shanghai Dongya Institute of Technology and has published more than 30 articles. His research plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>Research plan: Research on melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the pituitary gland and its application in the treatment of vitiligo patients in China.</p>
<p>Application of melanocyte-stimulating hormone solution to treat patients with vitiligo (commonly known as white spots) in China - It is a known fact that the animal pituitary gland, especially the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, can secrete a hormone. After treatment with this hormone, melanocytes in the skin of animals such as crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles expand into a network, and their skin color also turns pitch black. These hormones are simply called melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Although this hormone has greatly contributed to the biological adaptation of the above-mentioned animals, there is not much research on its efficacy in treating diseases. According to a recent report by the French professional Mr. Ai and his colleagues, they used melanocyte-stimulating hormone solution to treat human vitiligo and achieved extraordinary success. Although they have published the detailed procedures for extracting such hormones, based on my experience, patients with vitiligo are also seen from time to time in Shanghai. Therefore, I intend to make the following experimental attempts: First, extract melanocyte-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland of cattle using Mr. Shi's method, and then strengthen the effect of the hormone. It is hoped that the effect of injecting a very small amount of melanocyte-stimulating hormone can cure vitiligo patients among the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The reason why the effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone is enhanced after alkali treatment! The effect of melanocyte-stimulating hormone will be greatly increased after treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. This phenomenon has been reported by many people. In my previous work, I also said that the power of aging to enhance melanocyte-stimulating hormone is about 25 times. Although the results are extremely obvious, there is still no definite explanation for the reason for this strengthening. We now intend to use frogs and toads with their pituitary glands removed as research objects to explore the reasons why this alkali strengthens melanocyte-stimulating hormone by various methods.</p>
<p>Is the hypothalamus of the Asian toad an organ that can secrete melanocyte-stimulating hormone? Mr. Hazama of Japan wrote in 1931: From the point of view of secreting melanocyte-stimulating hormone, the hypothalamus of the Asian toad is similar to the pituitary gland, because when the hypothalamus receives mechanical stimulation, the secretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone suddenly increases, and the animal's skin color also turns pitch black. But according to my past experience and current preliminary observations, I feel that it is difficult to establish the hypothesis that this type of animal's hypothalamus area can be regarded as a structure that can secrete melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Whether a certain "structure possesses a certain function?" At least from a purely animal physiological point of view, it is an extremely important issue, so we intend to continue to use various technologies and methods to find the final answer: Is the hypothalamus of the Asian toad an endocrine organ?</p>
<p>The above plan will take about seven or eight months. The research results will be published in this newspaper again.</p>

<h3>Social Service: China Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital Sets Preferential Measures</h3>
<p>The China Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital at 41 Chihama Road has established four preferential measures for the purpose of serving the society: Teachers and students who apply for assistance from this newspaper's assistance fund will receive a completely free oral examination at the hospital (limited to mornings). Teachers or students who apply for assistance from this office and seek treatment for dental diseases at the hospital will be charged the most favorable consultation fee. Government, academic, industrial, and commercial groups that make special treatment appointments with our hospital can contact the hospital to negotiate preferential methods (no additional fees are required for appointments). If government, academic, industrial, and commercial groups wish to have their members undergo oral examinations, the hospital is willing to provide free service. If the number of people is over 200, the hospital will send doctors to work at the location. If the number of people is less than 200, they can come to the hospital for examination. The date and time will be designated by the hospital.</p>
<p>For the above four items, except for items 1, 3 and 4, which can be directly contacted and handled with the hospital, the second item requires an introduction certificate from this office to be valid.</p>
<h3>Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital Opens Its Seventh Session</h3>
<p>The Zhenxin Temporary Epidemic Hospital on Tianjin Road and Shanxi Road will open its seventh session today. It specializes in the treatment of cholera, dysentery, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, gastroenteritis and other symptoms. Whether it is outpatient or inpatient, all costs are completely free and no money is charged. Before the summer epidemic is rampant, in addition to other infectious diseases and lung diseases, other internal diseases will be temporarily treated. Outpatient hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Severe cases are treated as soon as they arrive, and there is no time limit day or night.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dingyu's Oil Painting Charity Exhibition a Great Success</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Dingyu graduated from Suzhou Art School at an early age. In recent years, he has lived in Shanghai with Yan Shiwenliang, a master of contemporary art circles, and has discussed art with him every day, which has improved his artistic skills. Now he is exhibiting 70 of his masterpieces at the China Art Gallery on Chengdu Road, holding four oil painting charity exhibitions. Most of the paintings are landscapes, with a few portraits in between. Among the landscapes, the painting "Sail Shadows on the River Bank" depicts the morning light fading and the shadows of sails dotting the river, which is the most poetic. The painting "Ten Thousand Miles of Future" is painted purely with a knife, and it can still fully express the changes in the sea of clouds, which cannot be achieved without a rich understanding of skills. Other paintings such as "Returning to Jiangling in One Day for Thousands of Miles" and "Lake Scenery and Misty Rain Washing the Stone Pillars" are vigorous, exquisite, and full of life. Among the portraits, the painting of Mr. Lan Ting has the demeanor of an elder, which is lifelike. The painting "Beautiful Eyes Looking Forward" depicts the face of a girl, lively and innocent, as if she is about to come out of the painting. It is scheduled to close on the 3rd of this month. Art lovers are still hoped to visit and select early. Both famous works can be obtained, and contributions can be made.</p>
<p>Nanshi United Clinic: Yang Jinzhang, a famous doctor of traumatology and a high-ranking disciple of Shi Xiaoshan, and two gentlemen, Ding Jiwan and Yan Mengdan, who are experts in internal medicine and time-sensitive conditioning, Chen Jiefu, have rich academic knowledge and experience. They have now jointly formed a clinic in Lao Yishengtang, east of Chenghuang Temple, Fangbang Road, Nanshi. Consultation hours are from morning clinic to afternoon visit every day, and the poor are not counted.</p>
<p>Public Medicine Broadcasting: The Chinese Catholic Physicians Association will hold a public medicine broadcast every Sunday from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM, starting on July 2nd, at the Shanghai French Cultural Radio Station (frequency 1400), hoping to contribute to public health.</p>
<p>Chinese Taoist Association: The Chinese Taoist Association has been instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau to appoint 15 people, including Zhang Weixin, Wang Langquan, and Zhang Tongsheng, as organizing committee members to preside over the reorganization of the Shanghai Taoist Association and convene a meeting on a set date.</p>
<p>Gubo Small Library: The Zhanbo Small Library in the Gubo Apartment, Fuzong Road, has specially established a method to encourage children and teenagers to read books and cultivate reading habits. It is tentatively scheduled to be held once a month. Those who visit the library to read or borrow books more often and can simply record and submit their content and experience to the library will be judged and awarded prizes. The first prize is 50 yuan, the second prize is 30 yuan, and the third prize is 20. It will start on the 7th.</p>
<p>Donation of Jinlong Mosquito Cream: Mr. Cheng Zhiliang has sent five dozen Jinlong Mosquito Cream purchased by Mr. Yang Fusheng of Heming Shoes and Hats Store, and asked us to distribute them to the poor and sick. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Cherry and Anchor (1) - Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>The next morning, after Zhenren returned to Yokosuka, Longfu felt quite lost.</p>
<p>(That guy has completely grown up...)</p>
<p>He has the same achievements as when he played at Tianbaoshan, talking about various theories. At the same time, Longfu tried to explore the heart of Zhenren, who was bright and upright. Zhenren's attitude, which was not arrogant and self-righteous but kind and friendly, was certainly no different from the past, but the greatness of the future was hidden in his spirit, which surprised Longfu. In the past, Zhenren was like an older brother, but he had never seen such a degree of enthusiasm this time. Zhenren did not hide anything and treated him sincerely, and openly revealed all aspects of his life, which aroused Longfu's interest, and he said:</p>
<p>"Does the Navy really intend to go to war with the United States?" Zhenren suddenly turned to him and said:</p>
<p>"People like me don't know about such things. But your painting..."</p>
<p>With these words, he changed the subject.</p>
<p>(Oh, that's right, that guy has become a soldier.)</p>
<p>Longfu thought this was obvious. He also thought that the five-year period had created a huge disparity between the two, but this did not make him feel lonely.</p>
<p>In short, the impression that Zhenren left on Longfu was very good and worth savoring.</p>
<p>Four or five days later, he received a postcard from Yokosuka, asking him to come to the ship to play. Longfu was very happy, danced with joy, and immediately agreed to the appointment.</p>
<p>Zhenren, who was waiting in front of the Port Authority, was no longer wearing a suit and leather shoes. Wearing a lieutenant's uniform and white gloves, he performed a salute, and Longfu felt that his figure, face, and outline were completely different from when they met in Ginza.</p>
<p>(How majestic! I envy you!)</p>
<p>He had not relived this old lesson of infatuation for a long time.</p>
<p>In less than a few minutes, Longfu became a guest on the ship for the first time. Although this was a temporary, dreamlike "guest on the ship", he was overjoyed by this encounter in a different sense from the old grievances. With the intention of becoming a naval painter, he boarded the bridge and walked on the deck, while looking at all the ships in the port. Although the ships were anchored, the people on them were working busily. On other warships, the bugles also sounded loudly, and the semaphore flags were waving up and down, left and right.</p>
<p>Longfu felt refreshed and intoxicated by the navy's dedication. Finally, he was led to the sub-officers' room and invited to eat black tea and snacks. So he also learned about the navy's appetite. But the taste did not surprise Longfu very much. What he felt was a special taste was the faces and conversations of the young officers who were introduced on the ship, which were all indescribably heroic. The air in the sub-officers' room was perhaps the most flavorful of the strong army.</p>
<p>(I liked "Navy" in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that.)</p>
<p>Longfu had nothing to regret about his fate. (110)</p>
