<h3>公用事業</h3>
<p>公用事業之目的，在於謀公衆之福利，這是無可變更的天經地義。公衆福利之應加重視，並非使一般人養成驕奢淫佚之習慣，而使其在種種便利之下，儘量發揮各個人智力體力之潛能，減少一切無謂之損耗，而增加工作之效率，以形成各項事業之總成績。　　今當戰事方酣決勝在即之頃，一切的一切都應加以緊縮，則公用事業當然亦應加以節約，使之在充實戰力上有所貢獻，這又是無可變更的天經地義。可是緊縮宜有限度，節約貴乎合理，否則一坐吃山空]，現有物資能維持幾日？況且運用物資亦需人力，若人力之效率減低，亦即物資之價值貶抑，間接的與充實戰力背道而馳！　　茲姑不論遠者大者，且希望公用事業無論在取費方面，供量方面，遇有變更之時，事前公布實施新辦法之日期，因事在必行，何妨及早通告，此非軍事秘密，又何必諱莫如深。例如限制水電之通知，竟有於限期一月以後始行送達者，在辦理公用事業機關方面其何以使事實與其計劃相符，在用戶方面更不知何以措手足，且有始終未得供量限制之通知，而處分之執行，竟突如其來，實尤感唐突。接受處分非所甘願，拒絕處分必遭嚴懲，刺激公衆莫此爲甚！電車漲價亦復如此，乘客往往在登車之後方知票價之變更，（最近十月一日之加價確鄭重將事，堪稱例外。）且有因所携車資不足，中途被迫下車，則於時間上精神上之損失爲何如？　　最近郵政情形亦遠不如往昔，本埠信件往往需三日至五日，外埠蘇杭鄰近各地之信伴，每需一星期左右始達，外埠容或受交通工具之影響，但不致若是之甚，本埠則更無理由可以自圓其說。一部分郵差以公事腳踏車公開營[單幫]之生計，以待遇不足振振有辭，但郵政當局寗不求加以合理之改善。若投遞之班次確爲節省開支而正式減少，則應公各週知，俾寄發信件者知提前付郵或竟改用其他工具，而免貽誤所預期之時限。狹義言之，郵政因非市區各自辦理，每不屬於公用事業範圍之內，但其影響（尤其本埠郵政）與電話電車初無二致，因論及之。　　物腐蟲生，由來有漸，一二腐敗之微跡，已足以影響整個社會，擴大之速率尤甚於疫癘。況草上之風，播動益烈。減低公衆之信賴。而處理公務精神頹喪之表現，尤覺凜然可慮，其他各項事業又何獨不然！不過公用事業之良窳，一般人因切身所受，感覺較敏，影象最深。至盼公用事業加以改善，姑不談增進福利，至少可免除不必要之痛苦，同時爲其事業之表率，而整個社會頓改舊觀！</p>
<h3>日南西羣島空襲擊落敵機廿餘架日潛艇亦擊沉敵航空母艦</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午二時三十分發表：十月十日自上午七時許至下午三時三十分間，會有敵艦載機累計四百架，四度來襲日本南西羣島之沖繩島，宮古島，奄美大島等各島，經當地日軍迎擊，擊落其二十六架以上，日方地上及船胉有若干損失。　　東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日下午四時三十分發表：一日潛艇三日於哈爾馬黑拉東方海面，襲擊敵航空母艦羣，將其一艘擊沉，一艘擊毀。二南鳥島日軍部隊，九日邀擊來襲之敵軍水上部隊，擊沉其驅逐艦一般，擊毀其巡洋艦·驅逐艦各一艘，日方損失極爲輕微。　　東京十一日中央社電　晶軍潛艇部隊搜索敵艦，於十月三日在摩洛泰島哥閑哥灣東方數十海里之海面上，發現正在行進中之敵航空母艦一艘，當將其擊沉，此舉係出於大胆之白晝攻擊，突破敵艦對潛艇之警戒綫，而一舉將其擊沉者，其間準備魚雷發射時，情形之緊張，實間不容髪，計擊沉敵航空母盤一艘。</p>
<h3>美艦襲南鳥島三度被擊退</h3>
<p>沉毀巡洋驅逐艦三艘　　東京十日中央社電敵美艦艇羣一日黎明三度對南鳥島加以砲擊，日守軍當據陸上砲台猛烈還擊，擊沉敵驅逐艦一艘，擊毀巡洋艦·驅逐艦各一艘，計午前激戰二次，下午一次，同日夜間敵美圖侵襲日軍基地未果，犧牲艦艇及士兵甚多，日方損失輕微，茲誌經過如次：一第一次戰鬥，敵美以本夕法尼亞型戰艦一般，本薩哥拉型重巡洋艦二艘及他型驅逐艦數艘編成之編隊，于九日黎明進襲南鳥島，且作砲擊，且向前進，日守軍當據砲台迎擊，結果敵驅逐艦一般中彈沉沒，另重巡洋艦一艘中彈三枚遁走。第二次戰鬥，敵艦隊于第一次受損失後，上午獲得海上機之援助，謀搜索驅逐艦沉沒之位置，再度向該島砲擊，日軍迎戰結果，驅逐艦一艘中彈受傷，即時敗走。第三次戰鬥，是日午後敵艦艇駛近驅逐艦沉沒地點，發射烟幕，開始搜索援救沉艦之艦員，薄暮時，在照明彈亮光下，又向該島砲擊，旋被日軍擊退。</p>
<h3>格亞特布期仍在激戰中</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　培里琉島之敵，八日再度以配備突然放射器之部隊，來攻日陣地北部之府山，但經日軍邀擊，予以重創後，即被擊退，惟敵復於九日整日猛烈砲擊日方陣地，但日陸上部隊並未因此而稍動搖，故該方此等動向，即知敵鑒於過去之重大損害，已極期愼重使用陸上兵力。又悉，截至九日止，抵達該島之敵軍救傷船，經日方確認者，已有九艘，同時於日軍五日夜襲擊敵機塲後，日潛伏攻擊隊更潛入敵機塲，敢行攻擊，使敵機塲西方發生猛烈之爆炸，隨而黑烟沖天，使敵不寒而慄，惟雙方仍在培里琉島北方格亞特布斯島激戰中，但敵近在積極利用培里琉島方面機塲中。　　東京十一日中央社電　中部太平洋電，培里琉島之敵軍，七日在集中砲火之掩護射擊下，向中央高地東南方地區及水府山方面之日軍陣地侵攻，但均被擊退。八日但復由培里琉島以水陸兩用戰車三輛，企圖於三子島登陸，經激戰三十分鐘後，敵後不支敗去。</p>
<h3>台灣實行武裝整備</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電朝鮮與台灣已舉其一切貢獻於戰爭，朝鮮爲中滿與日本聯絡之中軸，台灣爲防衛南方與內地之海上運輸路之要塞，故該地實具重要性，茲將台灣現狀介紹如次：台灣以地勢觀，乃日本向南洋發展之[扇軸]，在大東亞戰爭下，其政治價值尤爲重要，後由戰局之轉移，台灣更擁有戰略上之性格，頃台灣總督府預卜美軍開始菲律賓羣島作戰後，或將同時進犯台灣及琉球羣島，故特於八月五日決定台灣武裝整備要綱，着重防衛設施及作戰行動，人力物資之優先動員，結集[強化防衛力]與[整備戰塲產業經濟態勢]二點爲目標，運營[戰塲行政]，並設台灣總督府防衛本部，台灣總督府經濟動員部，將所有部督府之事務，均併合於此兩機構內，總督府所屬之官廳事務，澈底加以廢止或停止，其人員全部配置於生產方面，並已於九月十一日起，對台灣人實施徵兵制度。憶自中日事變以來，台灣人民即活躍於第一綫，担任軍夫，通譯，看護助手職務，自大東亞戰爭勃發以後，更參加陸海軍特別志願兵者極爲踴躍，昭和十八年度爲二十萬，本年度已超過三十一萬，又海軍志願軍者，昭和十八年度爲三十二萬，本年度已增十三萬五千。同時，台灣特設[勞務奉公圖]，關於[高砂義勇隊]之活動，已建有勳功，而永垂不朽，次實施微兵制度，全台灣民衆刻已組成多數護防挺身隊，從事公用地之建設，所有學生均放棄課本矣。</p>
<h3>泰防空局發表擊落美機三架</h3>
<p>盤谷十日中央社電泰國中部地區，六日晨有敵B24型機八架來襲，其中一架被旁塔拉地區之日軍防空炮火擊落。又另一架爲日戰鬥機於仰光上空擊落，據泰防空局九日發表，該日下午，美更以四引擎重轟炸機八架來襲鳥特拉底物地區，被日軍防空砲火擊落其一架。</p>
<h3>德川公爵任日貴院議長</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日貴院議長松平氏，上月十三日逝世，聞繼任人選決定爲德川德順氏，已於十一日下午正式任命如左：根據貴院法令第十一條，任命從二位勛二等公爵，德川德順爲貴院議長。</p>
<h3>桂林北方兩軍對峙中</h3>
<p>湘桂路戰事無變化　　里斯本十一日中央社電　據合衆社重慶電，渝軍頃於桂林北方廿五公里之處，與日軍對峙。目下湘桂路戰事無大變化，然據專門家稱，此乃一時狀態，日軍目下繼續增援編組軍隊，或將於最近開始進攻，一舉攻下桂林。又日軍亦有在東西挾擊桂林，越該市進攻柳州之可能。</p>
<h3>韶關混亂情形一斑</h3>
<p>廣州十一日中央社電　頃有渝軍青年將校，自韶關逃來談稱，詔關紛亂之內情如次：本人爲余漢謀麾下第一五八師上尉參謀，兼國民兵團副團長。於九月下旬由混亂不安之抗日地區韶關逃出，該地現因日軍之急速南下北上，致感恐慌，當局會強迫實施疏散，但現在疏散之市民，又有三分之一得當局之許可，再行遷歸者。民衆疏散時，物價一落千丈，刻下則繼續上昇，商業大半停頓。</p>
<h3>戰區民衆協力日軍</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地十一日中央社電　渝軍副參謀總長白崇禧，刻居桂林，擔當防務。最近渝軍除於桂林柳州，結成防止民心離反之對策委員會外，更於日軍進擊預想地區，配置武裝三民主義青年團，力行防衛。又衡陽失陷後，於湖南省某地，召開之軍事會議席間，蔣介石及何應欽，會率直報告作戰地區民衆，均積極協力日軍之事實。中國民衆於日軍進擊地區，呈示積極協力日軍之情形者，係因理解日軍嚴正之軍紀與其眞意故也。亦即覺醒和平統一，始爲救國之唯一途徑。華南地區歐大慶將軍領導之國民自治軍，於廣東結成後，未出三月，竟憶擁有將師員兵，此顯然呈示西南地區民心之趨向矣。</p>
<h3>華南日海陸軍恊力建功</h3>
<p>華南日軍某基地電日駐華艦隊華南部隊，於九月上旬，在廣東方面與陸軍部隊密切連絡，進行作戰，迄月前爲止，戰鬥槪況如次：（一）九月中間，進抵三水口之日海軍部隊，連日在敵機空襲下，奮勇繼續開通水路工作。至十七日，有P5l型敵機六架來襲，十四日亦有P５l型敵機十四架，用機槍掃射，腃一小時半，日軍隨起邀擊，擊落其一架。一方面敵軍從江岸之抵抗極形熾烈，日軍加以抵禦擊退，並將敵軍逃退時放置之水雷，予以擊沉。至九月下旬，遂能成功開通預定地點之水路，在此日期內，擊沉之水雷，達二百個以上。（二）進抵肇慶之海軍部隊，於九月中旬以來，繼續進行清掃西江水路工作，十八日在榮灣，十九日在孔　附近一帶，處分水雷一百個以下，此期間內，敵機來擾頻頻。由於日陸軍機之活躍，以及江岸陸軍部隊之砲火，晶軍艦艇邀擊，發揮海陸空一體之妙諦，得以繼續掃海工作。九月下旬日軍進抵封川方面時，敵機來襲更勤，至十月初，在蟠龍附近，與P５l型敵機七架交綏，屢經克服困難遂完成預期任務。</p>
<h3>中樞隆重舉行國慶紀念典禮</h3>
<p>陳代主席宣讀訓詞　　南京十一日中央社電　國府雙十節紀念典禮，十日上午八時，在國府大禮堂隆重舉行。由代理主席陳公博氏代讀汪主席訓示，其大意如次：革命思想誕生以來，經三十年之磨練，以至於武晶起義，終於顚覆清朝創建民國。然而帝國主久之壓迫日益加重，國家尚未到達獨立自由之地位，以中國一國之力量，到底不能與帝國主義鬥爭，最合理之方法，惟有亞洲被壓迫民族，一致奮起，打倒英美帝國主義。大東亞戰爭，實具有所謂解放東亞民族之大義名份，同時亦係使中國脫離帝國主義羈絆之千載一時之良機。故中國自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，即聲明與盟邦日本同甘共苦，繼而與英美宣戰，動員人力物力，努力於大東亞戰爭之完遂。日本自我國府還都以來，不但歸還租界，並取消不平等條約，並於中日基本條約附屬之議定書中，承認全面和平實現後，撤退駐兵，並放棄駐兵權。日本旣以此態度平等待我，大亞細亞主義，乃救中國與保衛東亞之最高原則，凡我同志，必須努力遵守，信驚實行檢討過去三十三年間之事實，當知革命前期之努力，不過僅爲武晶起義之成功而已，至於革命之完成，必須充分對國父所指示之國民革命方針，加以充分認識，必須覺悟此乃救中國與保衛東亞之唯一大道。　　南京十日中央社電國慶日，各國在華使節，上午聯袂赴外部祝賀。</p>
<h3>日天皇祝我國國慶</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　十月十日國慶紀念，日本天皇陛下，曁外務省兼大東亞省大臣重光奏，特電賀我中樞當局，表示祝意。</p>
<h3>吞敵的氣魄四</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>前面已經講過，敵人佔領馬金和塔拉瓦兩島，曾嘗去二千九百噸砲彈和炸彈，佔領庫埃茲林和魯奧特兩島，會費去一萬四千五百噸砲彈和炸彈。至於美國在太平洋海戰上所表現之奢侈性，正如美財長莫根索所長吁短嘆者，自開戰以來的戰費，共爲兩千萬萬金元，單純佔領馬紹爾的費用，亦會耗去六十萬萬金元。假如按戰前的滙兌率來合算，則單純馬紹爾作戰中也會費去二百四五十萬萬日元。　　但他們並不單純用物量來對付我們。他們也有相當的精神力。其精神力固然相當低級，但[勿忘其珠灣！]這句標語，對於他們美國來說，的確起最大電化作用。他們把戰爭看作是一種運動，失敗所受到的屈辱，誓死報復，這就是運動的本意。他們自己過去都不知道日本人的精神力，而今日卻都有某種瞭解了。　　而今是逐漸迫切反攻的時期了，在當局希望一般國民都成爲時宗以前，我們不得不熱望軍政當局者本身，先都成爲時宗。轉禍爲福，現在就是最好的機會·挽犯瀾於旣倒，今日就是最好的時機。敵人能攻擊的土地業已佔領了。能前進的道路業已前進了。再進而侵入我們本土，是不可能的。換言之，我們是以三千年悠久歷史的祖國爲戰塲，則我們日本正如孫子兵法所說，是[立於不敗之地]了。他們是懸軍萬里。無論有多少航空母艦，無論怎樣以馬利安那羣島爲航空基地，總而言之，他們是浮於客水立於客土。自己的眞正策源地，則遠在華盛頓。　　這就是說，我們把敵人引誘到腳底下來打的意思。假如我們有大的決心，則敵人愈逼近，而我們愈有把握。即所謂以逸待勞。　　談到此處，我們就不能不聯想到日本和朝鮮戰役時的碧蹄館戰爭，自然，壬辰之役時，日本軍隊由釜山登陸，不幾日而佔京城，繼而分軍兩路，一取平壤，一取威鏡道。然而明朝援軍以李如松爲大將，渡鴨綠江，勢如破竹，陷平壤，小西行長僅倖免於難，而逃至就城。於是日本各將領京商討如何邀擊明軍，多數人主張迫戰於京城。但只有小早川隆最反對這種意見。他說：　　[太　行軍以來，諸君每戰必勝，祗有勝戰之經騐，故不諳敗戰時之作法。僕前行軍，會數度失敗，最後則取得勝利，轉敗爲勝，故知敗戰之方法。此次敢請僕任大命。縱令我軍有一二次勝戰……亦如驅蠅，逐之復來，則日軍將士將疲於應戰，彼時則陷於十死一生之境地矣。]　　這就是說，諸位都是豐臣秀吉的部下，而只有勝利的經騐，但自己却有失敗的經騐，即有轉敗爲勝的經騐。所以此次應當完全交給他來打。他自任反攻僅軍帥，邀擊於碧蹄館，終於大敗明軍，李如松僅以身免。</p>

<h3>日政府經濟援菲貸予鉅款二億元契約已於昨日在東京簽字</h3>

<p>— 武公</p>
<h3>社會中堅指導人物座談</h3>
<p>在歐洲，常常有利用黃昏的頃刻，聚集社會有名人物在一起，以進膳的餘暇互相交換對某一問題的意見。所以此種[夜會]的座談，不僅在歐洲會作有好幾次政治的演變，且亦會改革了不少社會的不良制度。當記者自津唐返平以後，武德報編輯部長柳龍光先生就來函邀請參加他們國民雜誌所主催的[社會中堅指導人物座談會]。時間是十月四日下午六時，地點在東城無量大人胡同五號狄華利飯店。　　這個會雖然是武德報社的國民雜誌所主催，但因武德報係此間軍報道部所直營之故，所以就由柳龍光氏推請竹田報道部長任主席。出席的所謂社會中堅指導人物，大都是華北新進的少壯派政治家和軍人，記者不過因爲遠道而來適逢其會而已！現在先讓我來報告一些參加的究竟是什麼人：首先要說的，便是華北政務委員會總務應統計局局長杜超傑氏，他原是舊東北軍系軍人，自去歲華北政委會改組王克敏東山再起即任此職。這個職位原呌做調查統計局，相等於南京的調查統計部，可是後來把調查二字去了。杜氏雖然和我是初次見面，可是他的許多老友都是我的同志，所以在我沒有北來以前，早就聞名很久了。他是一位冷靜的人，面容上很有肅殺之氣槪。　　其次便是全國經濟委員會委員，中國文化學會會長兼北京大學教授余天休傳士。當我去歲在南京出席全國宣傳會議的時候，我早就和他認識了。他現在是北京有名的經濟學者，和南方的李權時先生一樣是一位沒有錢的名流。聽說，他還有一位善於交際而體格魁梧的太太。盟邦方面除竹田報道部長外，還有一位軍部的囑托工藤旨浩氏，他也已在十天前此間舉行決戰文學者大會時認識了。　　主人方面除柳龍光氏之外，也還有華北作家協會幹事王介人先生。其他都是這一次初次見面的，包括軍政商各界。譬如像新民會組織部長吳秋塵氏，北京市警察內一分局長周福庭，軍委會特派駐華北委員辦事處的龍少將和王魁溥上校，北京鐵路局副局長許傳榮，三豐股份有限公司北京支店的金仲明，市府專員裕振民，合作事業總會的總務局長張伯武，前北京市經濟局長邢先生以及還有一位傳鑫先生等。</p>
<h3>問題集中到貪官污吏</h3>
<p>開頭由竹田報道部長請王上校說明國府軍隊應該怎樣剿匪，王上校的結論是在於政治的強化，而政治的強化又需要一種革新勢力的產生，始足以促進全面和平。因此，話題便轉到貪官污吏身上。竹田報道部長帶着笑容說：[我也常聽得人家講過這件事，不過這究竟怎麼一回事呢？究竟大官吏貪污呢？小官吏貪污呢！]大家對於這個問題都筆了，首由杜局長略述澄清吏治的意見，其重點乃在於中央權力必須透澈於地方。因爲照杜氏所說，現在華北政委會的權力，簡直對地方毫無辦法，所以要把該會的政令推行於地方，非把政治力作一元強化不可。後來在吃飯的時候，杜氏還槪嘆地說，關於取締貪污，他們會上過數次條陳，如凍結遊資，取締投機與代售商店，限制銀行囤積等方案，可惜都未見實行。話題乃集中在現時的物價，因此竹田報道部長便請余博士發表關於通貸的意見。余氏帶着幽默的口吻說：[現在的經濟情形不能以平常的見解來測定，譬如說吧，我們住的一帶居民自三月份到七月份止，所有配給都沒有領到。像這種情形，還能談經濟的統制嗎？]　　在吃飯的時候，大家更隨便交換意見，記者當時深感到在這裹傾聽一夕談，實在勝過我到旁的地方去做幾個月的調查吧！竹田報道部長會問我說：[華北比較南方好吧！]我回答：[確是最後我便說，南方如上海市的配給倒還沒有領不到的情形。竹田報道部長聽後也筆了，於是我們的話題又集中到北京最近所鬧的煤荒，然而工藤囑托不久即說，關於此事軍部方大米久就會有良善的解決辦法。因此大家都說，這樣說來今晚的[夜談]還不至毫無收獲。　　後來因爲竹田報道部和有事先走，我們却談到十時半才散會。像這樣坦白而懇切的座談，不要說我此次到北京來還是初次遇及，就是在上海的時候也是很少。尤其中日雙方都能從誠摯的立塲，互相交換毫無虛僞與掩刷的意見值到佩服。竹田報道部長走後，由工藤囑托答覆種種問題，工藤講得一品好的華語，所以空氣也都融治無間了。今夜談話頂直爽而鋒利的，要推王上校和邢局長，他們都講得一口嫻熟的日語，更無需翻譯的手續了。</p>
<h3>人和制度問題的論爭</h3>
<p>大家對於改善我國的政治，多數是重視人的問題。所謂人的問題，就是說目前擔負政治責任的，其人事還沒有到健全的境地。他們大都贊成樹立一個[好人政府]，尤其要建設這樣的青年政治家出來領導，而企待造成新的中立政治人物。可是余博士却反對這個見解，他以爲中國的問題不在人而在制度。他的理論是極爲精剔的，他的大意是：[中華民國]四個字有加以反省的必要，因爲現在所謂[民國]早已名存實亡！他說：[清代亡於革命，革命後所出現的中華民國却亡於封建的殘餘勢力，所謂封建我國的重匪不軍閥或甚至是變相的匪徒。]他對我國的軍匪不分的見解，實在是一個很值得研究的問題。他的結論是主張我國應速即彷效盟邦明治維新，把大的明治維新是把大政交還於天皇，而我國則旣是民主國家，自以大政交還於民爲宜所謂大政交還於民，最主要的還在於把一切軍權。直接交還憲法。他說，如果不是這樣，無論如何，中國不會求得政治的安定，任何憲法也不會獲取實施。他把今日的蔣介石比做八十年前日本的德川幕府，所以他主張以革新的政治制度來推倒封建的餘孽。　　中國的問題究竟是在人呢，還是在制度？這實在是一個值得深切討論的問題。記者謹把個人所參加這個夜談的經過，約略報告於南方讀者之前，希望我們在這個決戰關頭，速即警醒吧！中國的政治，必須在自己的手中才能造成她新的前途，人與制度的問題或者都需要有新興的活力。以記者的拙見，目前正好像大家處於黑夜之中，所以人和制度都成爲黑暗的東西，但一經光明透露，黑暗的勢力自會消滅。什麼是光明呢？這不用說當然是新的中心信仰問題。目前的黑暗旣證明了現存一切思想的轉爲落伍，我們自必須拿出加倍的勇氣來，去求取新的中心思想，這樣才能推進時代，這樣才能革新中國，而統合人與制度二大勢力，造成一個新的光明時代！</p>

<h3>李氏演詞</h3>
<p>李思浩代表陳彬龢演詞原文如下：[今天是中華民國第三十三回的庭生日，全國各地同伸慶祝，在此民生疾苦日甚，政治未上軌道的當前，我們對此業已三十三歲的中華民國，不能不表示[少壯不努力]的感慨。但是這個責任，並不是任何個人所單獨担任的，而是任何人所應共同担負的，尤其是青年人們更應努力認清責任，負起責任。青年是不久的將來國家社會的負責份子，尤其在當前國家多故之際，更希望青年們奮發自勵，從鍛鍊身體與用功讀書入手，養成最有用的人才，將來爲國致用，建設國家，復興國家。國家是人民生存寄託的所在，每個同胞隨時隨地，要愛護國家，國家強盛了，發展了，我們的生存就是有了保障，有了寄託。世界上沒有一國的人民，莫不愛護其祖國，祖國生存人民亦生存，祖國衰亡人民自然無所寄託，譬如猶太人只知私利，並無國家觀念，因此等到自身私產充盈，而國家却已滅亡，到了這個時候，縱欲愛國亦無國可愛了，私人財產又有何用。這是供給吾們最切實的殷鑒，而人民愛國情緒最高的國家，所以我們要求國家的強盛，我們就須先愛國家。其次我們更應認識清楚，目前是爭取民族解放與國家生存時期，是大東亞範圍內各個家族的共同目標，所以我們不但要愛護自己國家，同時要愛護盟友諸邦，要愛護大東亞，以同舟共濟的精神，共同達到彼岸。今天我們慶祝國慶，希望同胞們，尤其是青年同胞們，特別警覺中華民國締造的艱難，以及目前時局的重大，共同齊一心志，齊一目標，堅定信念，向前途邁進。]　　昨（十一）日下午八時在蘭心大戲院舉行義演話劇，門票一律出售半價，全數充作貸學獎金，當由新中國報主筆魯風主席，該會總幹事行雲鵬報告紀念雙十國慶之意義後，由魯風演講，最後由聯藝出演名劇[海葬]。</p>

<h3>顧廷康個展之評價</h3>
<p>— 思源</p>
<p>近年來，由於社會重視文化，提倡藝術，書畫展覽也就蓬勃起來，因此畫家們，在各地點先後舉行個展者，實在不少，這次顧廷康先生舉行個展，開幕日，適逢雙十[國慶]節，給受好美術的人士們一個雙重的喜悅。　　顧先生的畫，在美術界·商業界·文化界·的印象中，似乎並不生疏，此次他以近作在八仙橋青年會所裹舉行展覽，是第一回。據說顧先生以粉畫聞名，但他的油畫，在事物之觀察上，用色之艷麗上，同樣可以排在第一流畫家的行列。他全部作品中；油畫不少，可見顧先生對於沒畫興趣之濃厚，更可以推想他對於油畫研究之程度。全部出品七十餘幅，連他的門人作品一起在內，共約八十多件，作品的內容以靜物爲最多，次之人像與風景。裝璜和佈置，都很費心力，而且得當。　　他的油畫和粉畫之色調和題材，可以說，已達到表現他自己的美感和風格，他的色調，有時覺鬰，有時熱烈，也許他取勝的地方，就在於此，他給欣賞者的感覺是複雜的色彩，統一的調子，以寒色作主色的，漪漣和溫柔，清麗和恬靜，以注意色作主色的，鮮艷而明晶，熾熱而光潤，這也許就多少可以代表作者的個性，興奮起來比任何人興奮，冷漠起來，比任何人還要冰冷。據接近作者的說，作者爲了被某種條件所限制，無法舒展他[豐收大地]的抱負，因此他這次的作品，取材於室內的居多。多遺憾啊！　　但，作者的作品有他獨特的面目，通常洋畫家所取的靜物題材，背景襯景多歡喜用濃厚的西洋化氣味，而他的作品，卻具有東方色彩和東方美的觀點的品格，例如他寫的靜物，瓶子，和陪襯景，大都以古色古香的本國物品爲對象，很合古玩家興味，他告訴筆者說：[我是中國人，當然我要更愛我們自己的東西。]　　畫人物，沒有相當根底，是不容易滿意的，但他對於人物畫上，所用的工夫，一定不在靜物和風景書之下，所以陳列的作品中人物畫雖然不多，但非常精采，其中除了幾張仕女可以充份表現女性美之外，要算第三號和第四號的人像了，構圖之莊嚴，用色之艷着，撩人欽遲，總之，他告訴觀衆，他是一個爲藝術而努力藝術的作者。他在對事物之觀察精細上，在用色之明暗鮮艷上，似乎沒有非議的地方。　　自然，畫家而不是空頭，談何容易，畫家而能在部份的技巧上成功，又豈是易事。畫家要下工夫要多方面修養，一定要具有下工夫和修養的條件，而物質和環境是主宰這一部份的要素，這是不用否認的事。然而有關痛癢或比較偉大的內容豐富的作品，在技七純熟的作者，未始不可能憑思彙構，不過有一點，我們可以肯定，這就是要看作者懷抱些什麼，平素關心的廣狹爲評值之論點。像顧先生這樣努力於藝術致力於都市現關的，雖不能說已經成功的作者，但在這本份上，在技術上究竟是可貴的。</p>
<h3>本月防空訓練成績大致良好</h3>
<p>日軍防空司令部評語　　上海日本陸軍防空司令就及海　防空司令部，頃就九日舉行之防空訓練，發表評語謂，[此次實施之民防空訓練，由於市民防空本部等各關係機關熱誠指導，以及市民一致協力，大致已能達到預期目的，無論對空監視待避消火救護等綜合訓練，咸能收獲良好成績，此點殊堪欣慰，然有一部份人完全表示消極，訓練成績，頗不足觀，對於平素訓練準備，猶抱疑問，此在目前戰局下，不能不表遺憾。茲將各種训練節目，略加評語於次：</p>

<p>[待避]一待避情形惟致良好，大對於利用地形及地上物，以及分散待避等亦有考慮必要，尤其須注意玻璃碎片。二待避之姿勢，切不可以顏面與腹部貼緊地面。三關於行路人待避，該地域自警團就引導待避塲所方法等，更須加以檢討。[消火及防空監視]一消火方面，水槽及手押幫浦設備未臻完善者頗多，宜速加整頓。二以對空監視言，今後必須依照指導機關發佈之監視要領積極訓練，對傳令用語更應加以研究。[救護]一市中心部份，一般救護技術大見提高。二各醫院之病人避難法進行順利。三高層建築物及工塲收容病人，以及應急措置治療設備等，今後尚有研究必要。四救護所內如無醫師時，須立即與醫師醫院民團救護班連絡。五止血法副木裝用法未熟練者頗多。[工廠防空]各工廠中極多防空用具缺乏，以及防空組織不澈底者，且太嘈雜。工廠防空之目的在於確保戰時生產力，但各工廠因營業規模及地點不同，故防空措置亦不可一槪而論，各工廠負責人速宜檢討其特性，確立不景響生產能力之防空態勢。外間常聞因防空而影響生產力，但此純屬工廠負責人檢討不良之故，切望今後廠方積極協力與研討。[燈火管制]一燈火管制過去，雖屬最着重項目之一，但一般而論缺點尚多，不得不表示遺憾，尤其楊樹浦地區成績最劣，其原因大致因警戒警報在白天早已發出，致黃昏後一般人均不加注意之故，此點速宜猛省。二對於燈火管制之澈底，自警團須負責的監督指導。三洩露直射燈火以及不熄滅殘燈者，亦多處可見。四電車頭之字幕燈及車頭圖燈光力太大。綜以上所述，今番防空訓練成績大致改良，但於小處尚缺少訓練，切望今後檢討過去，努力使民防空陣綫臻於完善。</p>

<h3>近來的青年（三）</h3>
<p>九位烈士給與全國的衝動，比排山倒海的怒濤還厲害。雜誌和報章的記者，都爭先恐後地訪問他們的故鄉，而著名的詩歌作家，每天總是滿篇累牘地在報章雜誌上發表着頌詞。其中，聯合艦隊司令長官寫給東京某少將的一對私信中說：[兵學樣前後畢業的年青戰士所參加的這一敢死隊，突入敵港而收獲到如是成果，眞令人五體投地]。這封信被一般人士知道後，又引起了更大的衝動。正當一般人士有一種習慣，往往喜歡叱責青年不認識時局的時候，而完成這一偉大戰果的，反而全是青年人，於是就更令人注意了。　　隆夫認爲自己也是一個青年人。羞恥和自豪　　（我也可以幹一下驚天動地的事業。）　　他認爲現在不是單單在眞人面前害羞的時候了。　　就在這個期間，他收到家鄉的爸爸的一封長信。　　（一是關於妹妹的事。）　　急忙拆封來讀，但信中幾乎並未寫着妹妹的事。長長的毛筆字的信紙裹，全部是講的眞人。　　下荒田的眞人家，已經停止了米舖生意，而另行開張了雜貨店，但這個店舖簡直被一般禮拜訪問的人山人海所堵塞。縣市等政府，舊藩主以及各方面贈送的花圈和祭禮，堆滿了院落和房屋，甚至也堆滿了門前，簡直無立足之地，我親自也去問候過，但眞人的母親和弟弟四吉，忙得兜兜轉，甚至未能寒暄幾句——　　房比隣右，甚至全鎭的街頭巷尾，每一個人都拿眞人先生的事情作爲談話資料，而全國寄給谷家的電報和快郵代電，每天都像雪片飛來的幾百封。有幾位鹿兒島的女學生寫成血書的感謝信，親自拿到谷家來。谷少校表彰會，也很快地由鎭內聞人發動起來了。河田二中校長和諸方先生，每天都應酬東京來訪的記者團，眞是蓆不暇暖——　　三月六日夜，Ｈ上校廣播時，谷眞人的母親毫不流淚地靜聽着。眞人君的　班穿着軍服來訪時，眞人的母親才放聲大哭！　　爸爸的信，顯然是由於興奮，而在宣揚自己兒子的朋友之功德。但由於感動，而竟把女兒的婚事也忘記提了。　　隆夫覺着這封信，眞夠得上爸爸，更稱得起鹿兒島人，於是微笑着，而只是在信邊上寫着一行字：　　——枝的婚事也成夢想了，但本人也並不特別悲觀。（一五○）</p>

<h3>Public Utilities</h3>
<p>The purpose of public utilities is to seek the welfare of the public, which is an immutable principle of nature and morality. Emphasizing public welfare does not mean cultivating habits of extravagance and dissipation among the general populace but rather enabling them to fully realize their individual intellectual and physical potential under various conveniences, reducing all unnecessary waste and increasing work efficiency, thereby forming the overall achievement of various undertakings.</p>
<p>Now, as the war is raging and the decisive moment is imminent, everything should be tightened. Public utilities, of course, should also be economized to contribute to strengthening war capabilities. This is another immutable principle of nature and morality. However, tightening should have its limits, and economizing should be rational. Otherwise, if one simply sits and consumes resources, how many days can the existing materials last? Moreover, the utilization of materials also requires manpower. If the efficiency of manpower decreases, the value of materials is also diminished, indirectly running counter to strengthening war capabilities!</p>
<p>For now, let's not discuss matters that are distant or grand. We only hope that public utilities, whether in terms of charges or supply quantities, when there are changes, will announce the date of implementation of new measures in advance. Since it is inevitable, why not announce it early? This is not a military secret, so why the need for such secrecy? For example, notices restricting water and electricity have sometimes been delivered more than a month after the deadline. How can the public utility agencies ensure that the actual situation aligns with their plans? And how can users know how to respond? Moreover, there are those who never receive notices of supply restrictions, and the execution of penalties comes suddenly, which is particularly offensive. Accepting the penalty is unwilling, and refusing the penalty will result in severe punishment. There is nothing more stimulating to the public than this! The same goes for the increase in tram fares. Passengers often only learn of the fare change after boarding the tram (the price increase on October 1st was indeed handled with great care and can be considered an exception). Moreover, if passengers do not have enough fare, they are forced to get off the tram midway, so what is the loss in terms of time and spirit?</p>
<p>Recently, the postal situation is also far from what it used to be. Letters within the local area often take three to five days, while letters to neighboring areas such as Suzhou and Hangzhou often take about a week to arrive. External areas may be affected by transportation, but not to such an extent. There is even less reason for this to be the case in the local area. Some postal workers openly engage in private peddling using their official bicycles, citing insufficient compensation as justification. But why doesn't the postal authority seek to improve this situation rationally? If the number of deliveries has indeed been formally reduced to save expenses, then the public should be notified so that senders know to mail letters earlier or even use other means, so as to avoid delaying the expected timeframe. Strictly speaking, the post office is not part of the public utilities because each urban area handles it separately, but its impact (especially the local post office) is no different from that of telephones and trams, so it is discussed here.</p>
<p>Decay breeds worms, and this has a gradual origin. Even one or two minor traces of corruption are enough to affect the entire society, and the rate of expansion is even greater than that of epidemics. Moreover, like the wind on the grass, it spreads even more violently. Reducing public trust, and the manifestation of a demoralized spirit in handling public affairs, is particularly alarming. How can other undertakings be any different? However, the quality of public utilities is felt more keenly and remembered most deeply by the general public because of their direct impact. It is hoped that public utilities will be improved. Let's not talk about increasing welfare; at least, unnecessary suffering can be avoided. At the same time, they can serve as a model for other undertakings, and the entire society will undergo a new look!</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Nansei Islands: Over Twenty Enemy Aircraft Shot Down, Japanese Submarines Also Sink Enemy Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 11th: On October 10th, from around 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM, a total of 400 enemy carrier-based aircraft in four waves attacked Okinawa Island, Miyako Island, Amami Oshima, and other islands of the Japanese Nansei Islands. Local Japanese forces intercepted them, shooting down over 26 of them. The Japanese side suffered some losses on the ground and on ships.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 10th: On the 1st and 3rd, submarines attacked enemy aircraft carrier groups in the waters east of Halmahera, sinking one and damaging one. On the 2nd, Japanese forces on Minami-Tori-shima intercepted attacking enemy surface forces on the 9th, sinking one destroyer and damaging one cruiser and one destroyer. Japanese losses were extremely light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Crystal Army submarine units searched for enemy ships and discovered an enemy aircraft carrier sailing in the waters dozens of nautical miles east of Gago Bay, Morotai Island, on October 3rd. They sank it. This was a daring daytime attack that broke through the enemy's anti-submarine defense line and sank it in one fell swoop. The tension during the preparation for torpedo launch was extremely high. A total of one enemy aircraft carrier was sunk.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ships Attacking Minami-Tori-shima Repelled Three Times</h3>
<p>Three Cruisers and Destroyers Sunk</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Enemy U.S. warships shelled Minami-Tori-shima three times at dawn on the 1st. The Japanese garrison fiercely retaliated from the land-based artillery platforms, sinking one enemy destroyer and damaging one cruiser and one destroyer. There were two fierce battles in the morning and one in the afternoon. On the same night, the enemy's attempt to invade the Japanese military base failed, sacrificing many ships and soldiers. Japanese losses were light. The details are as follows: 1. In the first battle, an enemy U.S. formation composed of one Pennsylvania-class battleship, two Pensacola-class heavy cruisers, and several other types of destroyers attacked Minami-Tori-shima at dawn on the 9th, shelling and advancing. The Japanese garrison retaliated from the artillery platforms. As a result, one enemy destroyer was hit and sunk, and another heavy cruiser was hit by three shells and fled. 2. In the second battle, after suffering losses in the first battle, the enemy fleet received assistance from naval aircraft in the morning to search for the location of the sunken destroyer and shelled the island again. As a result of the Japanese counterattack, one destroyer was hit and damaged and immediately retreated. 3. In the third battle, the enemy warships approached the location of the sunken destroyer in the afternoon of the same day, released smoke screens, and began searching for and rescuing the crew of the sunken ship. At dusk, under the light of flares, they shelled the island again and were repelled by the Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues on Geyatbus Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The enemy on Peleliu Island attacked the Japanese positions on Mt. Fuma in the northern part of the island again on the 8th with units equipped with sudden projectile launchers, but they were severely damaged and repelled by the Japanese forces. However, the enemy fiercely shelled the Japanese positions throughout the 9th, but the Japanese ground forces were not shaken by this. Therefore, from these movements, it is known that the enemy, in view of the significant damage they suffered in the past, are using ground forces with extreme caution. It is also learned that as of the 9th, nine enemy hospital ships had arrived on the island, as confirmed by the Japanese side. At the same time, after the Japanese launched a night raid on the enemy airfield on the 5th, a Japanese infiltrating attack team further infiltrated the enemy airfield and launched a daring attack, causing a violent explosion in the western part of the enemy airfield, followed by black smoke billowing into the sky, making the enemy tremble with fear. However, fierce fighting continues between the two sides on Geyatbus Island, north of Peleliu Island, but the enemy is actively using the airfield in the Peleliu Island area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Central Pacific Telegraph: On Peleliu Island, the enemy forces, under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, launched an invasion of the Japanese positions in the southeastern area of the central highlands and the area of Mt. Suifu on the 7th, but they were all repelled. On the 8th, the enemy attempted to land on Sanzi Island from Peleliu Island with three amphibious tanks, but after 30 minutes of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Implements Armed Preparedness</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Korea and Taiwan have contributed all they have to the war. Korea is the central axis connecting Manchuria and Japan, and Taiwan is a stronghold for defending the sea transportation routes to the south and the mainland. Therefore, these places are of great importance. The current situation in Taiwan is introduced as follows: From a geographical perspective, Taiwan is the "pivot" for Japan's development in the South Seas. Its political value is even more important in the Greater East Asia War. Following the shift in the war situation, Taiwan has acquired an even more strategic character. The Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, anticipating that the U.S. military would simultaneously invade Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands after commencing operations in the Philippine Islands, decided on August 5th on the outline of Taiwan's armed preparedness, emphasizing defense facilities and combat operations, and prioritizing the mobilization of manpower and resources. The goal is to combine "strengthening defense capabilities" and "preparing the battlefield industrial economic situation," operating "battlefield administration," and establishing the Defense Headquarters of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan and the Economic Mobilization Department of the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan. All affairs of the Governor-General's Office are merged into these two organizations. The affairs of the government offices under the Governor-General's Office are thoroughly abolished or suspended, and all personnel are assigned to production. The conscription system was implemented in Taiwan for Taiwanese people from September 11th. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people of Taiwan have been active on the front lines, serving as military laborers, interpreters, and nursing assistants. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, participation in the army and navy as special volunteers has been extremely enthusiastic. In 1943, there were 200,000, and this year it has exceeded 310,000. As for naval volunteers, there were 320,000 in 1943, and this year it has increased by 135,000. At the same time, Taiwan has specially established a "Labor Service Map," and the activities of the "Takasago Volunteer Corps" have been commemorated with勋功 and will be immortalized. With the implementation of the micro-conscription system, the people of Taiwan have now formed a large number of defense corps, engaged in the construction of public land, and all students have abandoned their textbooks.</p>
<h3>Thai Anti-Aircraft Bureau Announces Three U.S. Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency) - In the central region of Thailand, eight enemy B-24 aircraft attacked on the morning of the 6th, one of which was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire in the Bang Tara area. Another one was shot down by Japanese fighter planes over Yangon. According to the Thai Anti-Aircraft Bureau's announcement on the 9th, in the afternoon of the same day, the U.S. again attacked the Tra Trat Rat Dim area with eight four-engine heavy bombers, one of which was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<h3>Duke Tokugawa Appointed Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers, Mr. Matsudaira, passed away on the 13th of last month. It is reported that the successor has been decided as Mr. Tokugawa Iesato, who was officially appointed this afternoon, the 11th, as follows: According to Article 11 of the House of Peers Ordinance, Duke Tokugawa Iesato, of the second rank and second order of merit, is appointed Speaker of the House of Peers.</p>
<h3>Two Armies Confronting Each Other North of Guilin</h3>
<p>No Change in Xiang-Gui Railway War</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing army is currently confronting the Japanese army 25 kilometers north of Guilin. There has been no major change in the Xiang-Gui Railway war, but according to experts, this is a temporary situation. The Japanese army is currently continuing to reinforce and reorganize its troops, and may launch an attack in the near future to capture Guilin in one fell swoop. It is also possible that the Japanese army will attack Guilin from the east and west, and advance on Liuzhou via the city.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Chaotic Situation in Shaoguan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency) - A young Chongqing army officer who recently fled from Shaoguan stated that the internal situation of the chaos in Zhao Guan is as follows: "I am an adjutant staff officer of the 158th Division under Yu Hanmou, and concurrently the deputy head of the National Guard. I fled from Shaoguan, the chaotic and uneasy anti-Japanese area, in late September. The area is currently terrified due to the rapid southward and northward advance of the Japanese army. The authorities have forcibly implemented evacuations, but now one-third of the evacuated citizens have been permitted by the authorities to return again. When the civilians evacuated, prices plummeted, but now they continue to rise, and most of the commerce has stopped."</p>
<h3>People in War Zones Cooperate with the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Frontline Base, 11th (Central News Agency) - Bai Chongxi, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army, is currently stationed in Guilin, responsible for defense. Recently, in addition to forming committees to prevent popular defection in Guilin and Liuzhou, the Chongqing Army has also deployed armed Three Principles of the People Youth Corps in areas where Japanese attacks are expected, making great efforts to defend. Moreover, after the fall of Hengyang, during a military conference held in a certain area of Hunan Province, Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin reported frankly on the fact that the people in the war zones were actively cooperating with the Japanese army. The fact that the Chinese people in the areas attacked by the Japanese army are actively cooperating with the Japanese army is due to their understanding of the Japanese army's strict military discipline and its true intentions. That is, they are awakened to the fact that peaceful unification is the only way to save the country. After the National Autonomous Army led by General Ou Daqing in South China was formed in Guangdong, within three months, it had generals, officers, and soldiers, which clearly shows the trend of popular sentiment in the Southwest region.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval and Army Forces in South China Cooperate to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base in South China - The Japanese naval unit stationed in China, South China Detachment, has been closely cooperating with the army units in the Guangdong area since the beginning of September to conduct operations. The summary of the battles up to the previous month is as follows: (1) In mid-September, the Japanese naval unit that advanced to Sanshui-kou continued to clear the waterways bravely under continuous enemy air raids. On the 17th, six P51 enemy aircraft attacked, and on the 14th, fourteen P5l enemy aircraft also strafed with machine guns for an hour and a half. The Japanese army immediately engaged them, shooting down one of them. On the other hand, the enemy's resistance from the riverbank was extremely fierce. The Japanese army resisted and repelled them, and also sunk the mines placed by the enemy when they retreated. By the end of September, the waterway at the planned location was successfully opened, and more than 200 mines were sunk during this period. (2) The naval unit that advanced to Zhaoqing continued to clear the Xijiang waterway since mid-September. On the 18th in Rongwan and on the 19th near Kong, less than 100 mines were disposed of. During this period, enemy aircraft frequently harassed. Thanks to the activity of Japanese army aircraft and the artillery fire of the army units on the riverbank, the crystal army warships were able to engage and gave full play to the magic of sea, land, and air integration, enabling them to continue the sweeping operations. When the Japanese army advanced to Fengchuan in late September, enemy aircraft attacked even more frequently. In early October, in the vicinity of Panlong, they engaged seven P5l enemy aircraft, and after repeatedly overcoming difficulties, they completed the expected tasks.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Solemnly Holds National Day Commemoration Ceremony</h3>
<p>Acting Chairman Chen Reads Admonitory Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Double Tenth National Day Commemoration Ceremony was solemnly held in the National Government Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 10th. Acting Chairman Chen Gongbo read out Chairman Wang's instruction on his behalf, the gist of which is as follows: "Since the birth of revolutionary thought, after thirty years of tempering, the Wuchang Uprising finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China. However, the oppression of imperialism has become increasingly severe, and the country has not yet reached a position of independence and freedom. With the power of China alone, it is impossible to fight against imperialism. The most rational method is for the oppressed nations of Asia to rise up together and overthrow Anglo-American imperialism. The Greater East Asia War truly has the so-called righteousness of liberating the East Asian nations, and it is also a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for China to break away from the shackles of imperialism. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has declared that it will share weal and woe with its ally Japan, and then declared war on Britain and the United States, mobilizing manpower and material resources to strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Since our National Government has returned to Nanjing, Japan has not only returned the concessions, but also abolished the unequal treaties, and in the protocol attached to the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, it has recognized that after the full realization of peace, it will withdraw its troops and abandon the right to station troops. Since Japan treats us equally with this attitude, Pan-Asianism is the highest principle for saving China and defending East Asia. All my comrades must strive to abide by it and believe in its implementation. Reviewing the facts of the past thirty-three years, one should know that the efforts of the early stage of the revolution were only for the success of the Wuchang Uprising. As for the completion of the revolution, it is necessary to fully recognize the National Revolution direction indicated by the Founding Father, and it is necessary to realize that this is the only way to save China and defend East Asia."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - On National Day, the ambassadors of various countries in China went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the morning to offer their congratulations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Congratulates Our Country on National Day</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the Double Tenth National Day commemoration on October 10th, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, sent a special telegram to the Chinese central authorities to express their congratulations.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy Four</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>As I said before, the enemy used 2,900 tons of shells and bombs to occupy Makin and Tarawa Islands, and 14,500 tons of shells and bombs to occupy Kwajalein and Roi-Namur Islands. The extravagance that the United States has shown in naval warfare in the Pacific, as lamented by U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, is that the war expenses since the start of the war have totaled 20,000 billion yen. The cost of simply occupying the Marshall Islands also amounted to 6,000 billion yen. If we calculate it according to the exchange rate before the war, the Marshall Islands operation alone would have cost 24,500 million yen.</p>
<p>But they don't just use material quantity to deal with us. They also have considerable spiritual strength. Although their spiritual strength is quite low-level, the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor!" does indeed have the greatest electrifying effect for the Americans. They regard war as a kind of sport, and swear to avenge the humiliation they have suffered from defeat. This is the meaning of sport. They themselves didn't know the Japanese spiritual strength in the past, but today they all have some understanding of it.</p>
<p>Now is the time to gradually and urgently counterattack. Before the authorities hope that the general public will all become like the Ji Sect, we have to fervently hope that the military and political authorities themselves will first become like the Ji Sect. Turning misfortune into fortune, now is the best opportunity. Reversing the tide when it has already fallen, today is the best time. The land that the enemy can attack has already been occupied. The road that can be advanced has already been advanced. It is impossible for them to further invade our homeland. In other words, since we are using the motherland with a three-thousand-year history as the battlefield, Japan, as the Art of War says, is "standing on invincible ground." They are an army suspended thousands of miles away. No matter how many aircraft carriers there are, no matter how much they use the Mariana Islands as an air base, in short, they are floating on foreign waters and standing on foreign soil. Their real source of strategy is far away in Washington.</p>
<p>This means that we are luring the enemy down to our feet to fight. If we have great determination, the closer the enemy gets, the more confident we will be. This is what is called waiting at ease for the fatigued.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we can't help but think of the Battle of Byeokjegwan in the Japanese-Korean War. Naturally, during the Imjin War, the Japanese army landed in Busan and occupied Gyeongseong in a few days, and then divided the army into two routes, one to take Pyongyang and one to take Wiyeongdo. However, the Ming Dynasty reinforcements, with Li Rusong as the general, crossed the Yalu River and advanced like a hot knife through butter, capturing Pyongyang. Konishi Yukinaga barely escaped and fled to Jeongju. So the Japanese generals discussed how to intercept the Ming army, and most people advocated a forced battle in Gyeongseong. But only Kobayakawa Takakage opposed this opinion. He said:</p>
<p>"Since the beginning of the expedition, you have always won every battle, and only have the experience of winning battles, so you are not familiar with the methods of fighting in defeat. I have failed several times in previous expeditions, but in the end I achieved victory, turning defeat into victory, so I know the method of fighting in defeat. This time, I dare to ask to be entrusted with the great mandate. Even if our army wins one or two battles... it is like chasing away flies, which will come back after being chased away, then the Japanese soldiers will be exhausted from fighting, and at that time they will be in a situation of ten deaths and one life."</p>
<p>That is to say, you are all subordinates of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and only have the experience of victory, but I myself have the experience of failure, that is, the experience of turning defeat into victory. Therefore, this time it should be completely entrusted to him to fight. He himself took on the role of commander of the counterattack army, intercepted at Byeokjegwan, and finally defeated the Ming army, and Li Rusong barely escaped with his life.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Extends Huge Loan of 200 Million Yen in Economic Aid to Philippines; Contract Signed Yesterday in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:00 PM on the 11th: "[Based on the request of the Republic of the Philippines, in order to promote economic relations between Japan and the Philippines, the Bank of Japan will extend a credit loan of 200 million yen to the government of the Republic of the Philippines. This contract was signed on October 11th by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Shibusawa, and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the Republic of the Philippines to Japan, Vargas]." This credit loan aims to enhance the economic relationship between the Philippines and Japan after the Philippines' participation in the war. This loan, which coincides with the first anniversary of Philippine independence on the 14th of this month, is expected to strengthen the country's financial foundation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Outline of Japanese Credit Loan to the Philippines: 1. The government of the Republic of the Philippines may, within five years from the date of the conclusion of this treaty, borrow Japanese loans from the Japanese Bank, but limited to 200 million yen. 2. When the government of the Republic of the Philippines engages in the above borrowing, it shall, within five years from the date of the conclusion of this treaty, at any time repay the above borrowing in one lump sum or in several installments. 3. The period during which the above borrowing may be repaid may be extended after consultation between the Bank of Japan and the government of the Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Philippine President's Statement</h3>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel issued the following statement on the 11th: "[The Republic of the Philippines has received a credit loan of 200 million yen from the government of the Japanese Empire. This loan is very necessary for the continued stability of Philippine finances and for the promotion of domestic economic development. Now, my government and people are contributing to the increase of agricultural production, the restoration of public order, and the revival of businesses in order to achieve self-sufficiency in the Philippines. However, the current national income is absolutely insufficient to complete these undertakings, and it is necessary to seek additional large amounts of funds. Moreover, the government is spending a considerable amount of national funds to alleviate the suffering of the people. At this time, with the appropriate assistance of the Japanese government, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Japanese government on behalf of the government and the entire nation]."</p>
<h3>Remarks by the Philippine Finance Minister</h3>
<p>Manila, 11th (Central News Agency) - Philippine Finance Minister Alarms issued the following statement on the 11th: "[The Philippine economic organization before the war was solely dependent on exports and imports to and from the United States. One-third of the government's revenue came from import taxes and transaction taxes levied domestically on goods imported from the United States. Since the independence of the Philippines, in order to adapt to the progress of the new order, the domestic economic organization has had to devote all its efforts to reconstruction. As a result, although the results have exceeded expectations, the war situation has reached a critical stage, and economic activities have been negatively affected. As a result, the financial resources of the Republican government have also been depleted. Today, we can no longer generate revenue from entertainment facilities as in the past, and cash transactions have been drastically reduced, resulting in a decrease in government revenue. At this time, the Japanese government, in order to fully assist the Philippine government, has extended a credit loan of 200 million yen to our country. With this huge sum of money, we can not only restore the soundness of government finances, but also continue to carry out various economic developments and maintain public order to the extent permitted by the current environment. In addition, relief funds can be increased for the working people. As the Finance Minister, I would like to express my gratitude for the Japanese assistance in rescuing the people and increasing the strength of the Republican government.]"</p>

Berlin, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: Hai Tong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is taking place around Aachen. American forces are attacking the southeastern suburbs of the city with a large force, breaking through the German lines around the city.

The majority of the British Second Army is concentrated in the Nijmegen area, presumably to coordinate with the American forces and advance from the Nijmegen bridgehead into the Westphalian industrial area west of the Rhine and the northern plains of Germany. The battles in Lorraine and the western foothills of the Vosges Mountains have become secondary. It goes without saying that the right wing of the anti-Axis forces, including the American and Seventh Armies, has the mission of containing the German forces and diverting their attention from the center of the offensive.

<p>A Meaningful Night Meeting</p>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<h3>Symposium for Leading Figures of Society's Backbone</h3>
<p>In Europe, it is common to gather prominent figures of society together during the evening to exchange opinions on a particular issue during dinner. Therefore, these kind of [night meeting] symposiums have not only led to several political changes in Europe, but have also reformed many of society's unhealthy systems. After I, the reporter, returned to Peiping from Tianjin and Tangshan, Mr. Liu Longguang, the editorial director of Wude News, sent me a letter inviting me to participate in the [Symposium for Leading Figures of Society's Backbone] organized by their National Magazine. The time was 6:00 PM on October 4th, and the location was Di Hua Li Restaurant, No. 5 Wuliang Daren Hutong, East City.</p>
<p>Although this meeting was organized by the National Magazine of Wude News, because Wude News is directly operated by the military news department here, Mr. Liu Longguang asked Mr. Takeda, the news department director, to serve as chairman. The so-called leading figures of society's backbone who attended were mostly rising young political figures and military personnel in North China. I, the reporter, was merely there due to being from afar and happening to be present! Now, let me first report on who exactly attended: First to be mentioned is Mr. Du Chaojie, Director of the General Affairs and Statistics Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He was originally a military officer in the old Northeast Army system. He assumed this position when Wang Kemin re-emerged last year after the reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Commission. This position was originally called the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, equivalent to the Investigation and Statistics Department in Nanjing, but later the word "Investigation" was removed. Although I had never met Mr. Du before, many of his old friends were my comrades, so I had heard of him long before coming north. He is a calm person with a face that has a very stern air.</p>
<p>Next is Mr. Yu Tianxiu, a member of the National Economic Commission, President of the Chinese Cultural Society, and Professor at Peking University. I had already met him when I attended the National Propaganda Conference in Nanjing last year. He is now a famous economist in Beijing, and like Mr. Li Quanshi in the South, he is a celebrity without money. It is said that he also has a wife who is good at socializing and has a robust physique. In addition to News Director Takeda, there was also Mr. Kudo Yoshihiro, a consultant to the military, who I had met ten days ago at the Great Assembly of Decisive Battle Writers held here.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Liu Longguang, the host side also included Mr. Wang Jieren, Secretary of the North China Writers Association. The others were all people I met for the first time, including people from military, political, and business circles. For example, Mr. Wu Qiuchen, the organization minister of the Xinmin Association, Zhou Futing, the chief of the No. 1 branch of the Beijing Municipal Police, Major General Long and Colonel Wang Kuipu of the Military Affairs Commission's Special Commissioner's Office in North China, Xu Chuanrong, the deputy director of the Beijing Railway Bureau, Jin Zhongming of the Beijing branch of Sanfeng Co., Ltd., Yu Zhenmin, a specialist of the municipal government, Zhang Bowu, the director of the general affairs bureau of the Cooperative Enterprises Association, Mr. Xing, the former director of the Beijing Economic Bureau, as well as a Mr. Chuan Xin, etc.</p>
<h3>Questions Concentrated on Corrupt Officials</h3>
<p>At the beginning, News Director Takeda asked Colonel Wang to explain how the National Government army should suppress bandits. Colonel Wang's conclusion was that it depended on strengthening politics, and strengthening politics required the emergence of a force for reform to promote overall peace. Therefore, the topic turned to corrupt officials. News Director Takeda said with a smile: [I often hear people talk about this, but what exactly is going on? Are the high-ranking officials corrupt, or the low-ranking officials corrupt?] Everyone was silent on this question. First, Director Du briefly described his views on clarifying officialdom, the key point of which was that central power must thoroughly penetrate the local level. Because, according to Mr. Du, the North China Political Affairs Commission's power simply had no way to deal with the local level, so to implement the committee's policies at the local level, it was necessary to strengthen political power in a unified manner. Later, while eating, Mr. Du also sighed and said that regarding the crackdown on corruption, they had submitted several proposals, such as freezing idle capital, banning speculation and consignment shops, and restricting bank hoarding, but unfortunately, none of them had been implemented. The topic then focused on current prices, so News Director Takeda asked Dr. Yu to express his views on inflation. Mr. Yu said in a humorous tone: [The current economic situation cannot be measured with ordinary views. For example, the residents in the area where we live have not received any rations from March to July. In this situation, can we still talk about economic control?]</p>
<p>While eating, everyone exchanged opinions more casually. I, the reporter, deeply felt that listening to a night's worth of talks here was really better than doing several months of investigation elsewhere! News Director Takeda asked me: [Is North China better than the South?] I replied: [It is indeed.] Finally, I said that in the South, such as in Shanghai, there was still no situation where rations could not be received. News Director Takeda was also silent after hearing this, and then our topic focused on the recent coal shortage in Beijing. However, Consultant Kudo soon said that the military was confident that Mr. Okomoto Daijiu would have a good solution to this matter. Therefore, everyone said that in this case, tonight's [night talk] was not entirely without results.</p>
<p>Later, because News Director Takeda had other engagements and left first, but we continued talking until 10:30 PM before adjourning. Such a frank and sincere symposium, not to mention that this was the first time I had encountered it since coming to Beijing, was also rare even in Shanghai. It was especially admirable that both China and Japan could exchange opinions from a sincere standpoint, without any hypocrisy or concealment. After News Director Takeda left, Consultant Kudo answered various questions. Mr. Kudo spoke excellent Chinese, so the atmosphere was harmonious without any gaps. The frankest and most incisive speakers tonight were Colonel Wang and Director Xing, who both spoke fluent Japanese, eliminating the need for translation.</p>
<h3>Debate on the Issues of People and Systems</h3>
<p>Most people believe that improving our country's politics requires a focus on the issue of people. The so-called issue of people means that the people currently bearing political responsibility have not yet reached a healthy state. They mostly agreed to establish a [good people government], especially to cultivate such young political figures to lead, and to expect the creation of new neutral political figures. However, Dr. Yu opposed this view, believing that China's problem was not in people but in the system. His theory was extremely insightful. His main idea was: [The Republic of China] the four words, have a need to reflect, because the so-called [Republic] is now, only exists in name only! He said: [The Qing Dynasty died in revolution, but the Republic of China that emerged after the revolution died in the remnants of feudal forces, the so-called feudal forces are not warlords or even disguised bandits]. His view on our country's indistinct military and banditry is really a problem worth studying. His conclusion is that our country should quickly emulate the Meiji Restoration of the Allied Powers. The great Meiji Restoration was the return of great governance to the Emperor, and our country is already a democratic country, so it is appropriate to return great governance to the people. The so-called return of great governance to the people, the most important thing is to return all military power. Directly return the constitution. He said that if this is not the case, in any case, China will not seek political stability, and no constitution will be implemented. He compared today's Chiang Kai-shek to the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan eighty years ago, so he advocated using an innovative political system to overthrow the remnants of feudalism.</p>
<p>Is China's problem in people, or is it in the system? This is really a problem worth discussing deeply. I, the reporter, respectfully report the experience of my personal participation in this night talk to the readers in the South, hoping that we will quickly wake up at this critical juncture! China's politics must be created in her own hands to create a new future, and the issues of people and systems may both need emerging vitality. In my humble opinion, it is currently as if everyone is in the dark night, so both people and systems become dark things, but once the light is revealed, the power of darkness will naturally be eliminated. What is the light? Needless to say, of course, is the new issue of central belief. The current darkness has proven that all existing thoughts have become obsolete, and we must take double the courage to seek new central ideas, so that we can advance the times, so that we can innovate China, and integrate the two major forces of people and systems to create a new era of light!</p>

<h3>New Association National Day Film and Speech Meeting</h3>
<p>President Li of the News Association gives a speech. The Shanghai News Association held a film and speech meeting and a charity performance of Peking opera and drama to raise funds for education in celebration of the Double Tenth National Day. A film and speech meeting was held at the Great Light Grand Theater at 8:00 PM on the 10th. Mr. Li Sihao, President of the China News Association, was invited to give a speech. Due to Mr. Li's illness, Vice President Chen Binhe gave the speech on his behalf. Many people from all walks of life in the city went to listen to the speech. The association was attended by Executive Directors Xu Liqiu and Huang Jingqi, as well as Secretary-General Ren Yunpeng. After the whole body sang the national anthem and performed the rituals, Chairman Huang Jingqi delivered the opening speech, saying that today is the 33rd anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Looking back on the past, our country has been in a state of hardship and difficulty and has not been able to develop as much as possible. Tracing the historical records of China in the past 100 years, he explained that it has suffered from the invasion, oppression, exploitation, and bondage of Britain and the United States, and China has not been free. In order to achieve the independence of the Chinese nation, we must concentrate our strength, unite the 450 million compatriots in China, and unite all the nations of East Asia to work together to not only strive for the independence and freedom of China, but also strive for the independence and freedom of East Asia. At the current time of decisive battle, in order to achieve China's independence, we must firmly believe in victory and strive to move forward. This is the meaning of today's celebration, and we are very grateful for the cooperation of all parties. Then, Li Sihao gave a speech on behalf of Chen Binhe. Finally, the Huaying film "[Bitter Child's Paradise]" was screened, and the meeting was adjourned at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Li's Speech</h3>
<p>The original text of Li Sihao's speech on behalf of Chen Binhe is as follows: [Today is the 33rd anniversary of the Republic of China. Celebrations are held all over the country. At a time when the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult and politics is not on track, we cannot but express our feelings of [the young do not work hard] for this Republic of China, which is already 33 years old. However, this responsibility is not the sole responsibility of any individual, but is the responsibility of anyone, especially young people who should strive to recognize their responsibilities and assume their responsibilities. Young people are the responsible members of the country and society in the near future, especially at a time when the country is in trouble. We hope that young people will be motivated to improve themselves, starting with exercising their bodies and studying hard, cultivating the most useful talents, and using them for the country, building the country, and revitalizing the country in the future. The country is the place where the people live and rely on. Every compatriot must love the country at all times and in all places. If the country is strong and developed, our survival will be guaranteed and we will have something to rely on. There is no country in the world whose people do not love their motherland. If the motherland survives, the people will also survive. If the motherland perishes, the people will naturally have nothing to rely on. For example, the Jews only know about private interests and have no concept of the country. Therefore, when their own private property is full, the country has already perished. At this time, even if they want to love the country, there is no country to love, and what is the use of private property. This is the most practical lesson for us, and the country with the highest patriotic enthusiasm of the people, so we ask for the strength of the country, and we must first love the country. Secondly, we should also recognize clearly that the current period is a period of striving for national liberation and national survival, which is the common goal of all families within the scope of Greater East Asia, so we must not only love our own country, but also love our allied countries, love Greater East Asia, and work together in the spirit of sharing the same boat to reach the other shore. Today we celebrate National Day, and we hope that our compatriots, especially young compatriots, will be particularly alert to the difficulty of creating the Republic of China and the importance of the current situation, unite our minds and goals, strengthen our beliefs, and move forward toward the future.] Yesterday (11th) at 8:00 PM, a charity drama performance was held at the Lyceum Theatre. Tickets were sold at half price, and all the proceeds were used as scholarship loans. The editor of New China News, Lu Feng, chaired the performance, and the association's secretary-general, Xing Yunpeng, reported on the significance of commemorating the Double Tenth National Day. After Lu Feng gave a speech, Lianyi performed the famous drama "[Sea Burial]".</p>

Our newspaper staff extends our sincere gratitude.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Today for Lieutenant Commander Oya of Tenian Island by Chinese and Japanese Groups</h3>
<p>After Lieutenant Commander Goichi Oya, commander of the Allied naval forces on Tenian Island, heroically sacrificed his life on the 27th of last month, the news spread, and Chinese and Japanese people mourned in unison.

Furthermore, after the memorial service is completed on the same day, friends of the late Lieutenant Commander will continue to gather in another room of the hall to hold a memorial meeting.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of Gu Tingkang's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Siyuan</p>
<p>In recent years, with society's emphasis on culture and promotion of art, art exhibitions have flourished. Therefore, many painters have held solo exhibitions in various places, one after another. This time, Mr. Gu Tingkang held a solo exhibition, and the opening day coincided with the Double Tenth [National Day], giving art lovers a double joy. Mr. Gu's paintings seem to be familiar to people in the art world, business world, and cultural circles. This exhibition of his recent works at the YMCA in Ba Xianqiao is his first solo show. It is said that Mr. Gu is famous for his pastel paintings, but his oil paintings, in terms of observation of things and the brilliance of colors, can also be ranked among the first-class painters. Many of his works are oil paintings, which shows Mr. Gu's strong interest in painting and further suggests his level of research in oil painting. The entire exhibition includes more than 70 works, plus the works of his students, totaling about 80 pieces. The content of the works is mostly still life, followed by portraits and landscapes. The decoration and layout were carefully considered and well-executed. The colors and themes of his oil and pastel paintings can be said to have reached the point of expressing his own sense of beauty and style. His colors are sometimes melancholy and sometimes passionate, and perhaps this is where he succeeds. The feeling he gives to the appreciator is complex colors and a unified tone. Those using cold colors as the main tone are rippling and gentle, clear and tranquil. Those using bright colors as the main tone are bright and crystal, fiery and lustrous. This may represent the author's personality to some extent: more excited than anyone when excited, and colder than anyone when indifferent. According to people close to the author, the author is limited by certain conditions and cannot express his [harvest of the land] ambitions, so his works this time mostly take place indoors. What a pity! However, the author's works have a unique appearance. The still life themes usually taken by Western painters often use a strong Western flavor as the background, while his works have an Eastern color and a viewpoint of Eastern beauty. For example, the still life he paints, the bottles, and the accompanying scenes, mostly use antique domestic items as the object, which is very in line with the taste of antique collectors. He told the writer: [I am Chinese, of course, I want to love our own things more.] It is not easy to be satisfied with painting figures without a solid foundation, but the effort he puts into figure painting must not be less than that of still life and landscape painting. Therefore, although there are not many figure paintings in the exhibited works, they are very brilliant. Among them, in addition to a few ladies who can fully express feminine beauty, the most noteworthy are portraits Nos. 3 and 4. The composition is solemn, and the colors are gorgeous, which is fascinating. In short, he tells the audience that he is an author who strives for art. In terms of his meticulous observation of things and the brightness and darkness of colors, there seems to be no room for criticism. Naturally, it is not easy to be a painter and not just a talking head. It is even more difficult for a painter to succeed in some techniques. Painters must put in effort and cultivate in many ways, and they must have the conditions for putting in effort and cultivation, and material and environment are the elements that dominate this part, which is undeniable. However, it is not impossible for authors with pure skills to rely on thinking to construct works that are relevant or relatively great and rich in content. However, one thing we can be sure of is that it depends on what the author is thinking and the breadth of his usual concerns as a point of evaluation. Like Mr. Gu, who works hard at art and devotes himself to the current situation in the city, although he cannot be said to be a successful author, he is still valuable in this capacity and in terms of technique.</p>
<h3>This Month's Air Defense Training Generally Successful</h3>
<p>Comments from the Japanese Air Defense Command. The Shanghai Japanese Army Air Defense Command and the Naval Air Defense Command recently issued comments on the air defense training held on the 9th, stating, [The civil air defense training implemented this time, due to the enthusiastic guidance of the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters and other related agencies, as well as the unanimous cooperation of the citizens, has generally achieved its intended purpose. Good results have been achieved in comprehensive training such as air surveillance, evacuation, fire extinguishing, and rescue. This is very gratifying. However, some people were completely passive, and the training results were quite unsatisfactory. There are still doubts about peacetime training preparations, which is regrettable in the current war situation. The various training programs are briefly commented on below:]</p>
<h3>Points to Note</h3>
<p>[Evacuation] 1. The evacuation situation is generally good, but it is also necessary to consider using terrain and ground objects, as well as dispersed evacuation. Special attention should be paid to glass fragments. 2. The posture of evacuation should not have the face and abdomen close to the ground. 3. Regarding the evacuation of pedestrians, the self-defense corps in the area must further review methods such as guiding evacuation sites. [Fire Extinguishing and Air Surveillance] 1. In terms of fire extinguishing, many water tanks and hand-operated pumps are not perfect and should be quickly rectified. 2. In terms of air surveillance, it is necessary to actively train in accordance with the surveillance guidelines issued by the guiding agencies in the future, and the terminology for relaying orders should be further studied. [Rescue] 1. In the central part of the city, general rescue techniques have greatly improved. 2. The evacuation methods for patients in various hospitals are progressing smoothly. 3. The accommodation of patients in high-rise buildings and factories, as well as emergency treatment equipment, still need further research in the future. 4. If there is no doctor in the rescue station, it is necessary to immediately contact the doctor, hospital, and civil defense rescue team. 5. Many people are not proficient in hemostasis and splint application. [Factory Air Defense] Many factories lack air defense equipment and the air defense organization is not thorough, and it is too noisy. The purpose of factory air defense is to ensure wartime productivity, but the air defense measures should not be generalized due to the different business scales and locations of each factory. The person in charge of each factory should quickly review its characteristics and establish an air defense posture that does not affect production capacity. It is often heard that air defense affects productivity, but this is purely due to the factory's person in charge's poor review. It is hoped that the factory will actively cooperate and study in the future. [Lighting Control] 1. Although lighting control has been one of the most important items in the past, there are still many shortcomings in general, and it is regrettable to have to express this, especially in the Yangshupu area, where the results are the worst. The reason for this is roughly because the warning alarm was issued early in the daytime, so people generally do not pay attention after dusk, and this point should be promptly re-examined. 2. The self-defense corps must be responsible for supervising and guiding the thorough implementation of lighting control. 3. There are also many places where direct light is leaked and residual lights are not extinguished. 4. The subtitle lights and headlight illustration lights of streetcars are too bright. In summary, the results of this air defense training have been greatly improved, but there is still a lack of training in small details. It is hoped that in the future, we will review the past and strive to make the civil air defense front perfect.</p>
<h3>Property Owners Not in Shanghai Urged to Register Real Estate</h3>
<p>The main task of the Shanghai Municipal Property Owners Not in Shanghai Real Estate Management Committee is to maintain the people's property rights and protect the legal interests of property owners. In order to clarify whether property owners are in Shanghai or not, the committee, with the approval of the municipal government, is conducting a real estate survey and registration in the Huxi and Hubei districts, with a deadline of the end of November this year. All property owners in these two districts who are currently in the city must bring their accurate property ownership certificates, originals and copies, to the committee's Huxi office (358 Yuyuan Road) or Hubei office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor) to apply for registration. Otherwise, they will be considered property owners not in Shanghai, and the committee will take over the property. It is also heard that those who are currently occupying ownerless houses in the two districts must personally go to the above-mentioned offices in the two districts before the end of this month to sign lease procedures. If they conceal and do not report, once verified, they will be ordered to move, and they will be fined ten months' rent. Those who are reported by others will receive a bonus of 50%.</p>

<h3>Donation of a Percentage of Consultation Fees to Charity</h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Naigang wrote in a letter: [Doctors should have the spirit of mutual assistance in helping the poor and treating illnesses, adhering to the purpose of benevolence and saving the world. At this time, when rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, and everything is soaring in price, it is difficult for ordinary people to maintain their lives. Once they are entangled in illness, and poverty and disease are intertwined, it is even more pitiable. In view of this, I am setting up a clinic at the east of the Iron Gate at Lao Beimenkou, specializing in all kinds of hot and cold diseases, and also treating internal and external acupuncture departments. I will charge appropriate consultation fees, and waive all fees for the destitute. In addition, I will donate 10% of the consultation fees to charity. I am enclosing 1,035 yuan, which is 10% of the consultation fees for September, to be used as medical assistance funds for your organization.]</p>

<h3>Shanghai Anlaoyuan Appeals for Donations, Hopes People from All Walks of Life Will Participate in the Charitable Undertaking</h3>
<p>Goal: 5 million yuan. Period: October 10th to November 10th. Collection location: Social Service Department of this newspaper. Publication date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. When people reach old age, they all hope to have filial sons and obedient grandchildren. Unfortunately, they may encounter misfortune and lose their support. They have no way to rely on themselves, and they lack the skills to make a living. Their distress is definitely not something that old hearts can bear. The Shanghai Anlaoyuan was established to make up for this deficiency, housing lonely elderly people and providing them with support and care by nuns. They are served with food and drink, their daily life is taken care of, they are cared for when they are sick, their clothes are washed, and even when they are old and weak and need to use the toilet, they are helped with kindness. They are accompanied at the end of their lives, and their funerals are taken care of after their deaths. Is this not a miracle of the world? Recently, due to financial difficulties, they are appealing for donations. The Book of Songs says: [Good are the rich, pity the lonely]. I hope that benevolent gentlemen will donate generously and participate in the charitable undertaking. We cannot help but look forward to it.</p>

<h3>The Youth of Today (3)</h3>
<p>The impact that the nine martyrs gave to the country was more powerful than a tidal wave. Reporters from magazines and newspapers were rushing to visit their hometowns, and famous poets were publishing eulogies in newspapers and magazines every day. Among them, a private letter written by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet to a certain major general in Tokyo said: [The daredevil team formed by the young warriors who graduated from the military academy before and after each other broke into the enemy port and achieved such results, which is truly admirable]. After this letter became known to the general public, it caused an even greater impact. When the general public had a habit of often criticizing young people for not recognizing the situation, the completion of this great achievement was all by young people, which made people pay more attention. Longfu thought he was also a young man. Shame and pride (I can also do something earth-shattering.) He felt that now was not the time to be shy in front of Mr. Zhen. During this period, he received a long letter from his father in his hometown. (One is about my sister.) He hurriedly opened the letter to read it, but the letter hardly mentioned his sister. The long letter paper written in brushstrokes was all about Mr. Zhen. The Zhen family in Xiahuangtian has stopped the rice shop business and opened a grocery store instead, but this shop is simply blocked by a sea of people visiting. Wreaths and sacrificial gifts from the county and city governments, former feudal lords, and various parties filled the courtyard and houses, and even the front of the door, leaving no room to stand. I personally went to greet them, but Mr. Zhen's mother and younger brother, Siji, were so busy that they couldn't even exchange a few words— The neighbors in the front and back, and even everyone in the streets and alleys of the whole town, took Mr. Zhen's affairs as talking points, and hundreds of telegrams and express mail remittances sent to the Gu family from all over the country came like snowflakes every day. Several female students from Kagoshima wrote thank-you letters in blood and brought them to the Gu family in person. The Taniguchi Major Commemoration Association was quickly launched by local celebrities. The principal of Kawata Second Middle School and Mr. Zhufang are entertaining the visiting press corps from Tokyo every day, and there is really no time to rest— On the night of March 6, Colonel H broadcast, and Gu Zhen's mother listened quietly without shedding tears. When Mr. Zhen's class visited in military uniforms, Mr. Zhen's mother burst into tears! My father's letter was obviously promoting the merits of his son's friend out of excitement. But due to emotion, he even forgot to mention his daughter's marriage. Longfu felt that this letter was worthy of his father, and even more worthy of the people of Kagoshima. He smiled and just wrote a line on the edge of the letter: ——Zhi's marriage has also become a dream, but I am not particularly pessimistic either. (150)</p>
