<h3>星期評論　農業與工業</h3>
<p>— 廖家楠</p>
<p>最近頗有人懷疑現階段要發展中國的產業，稪興經濟，還是重農呢？抑是重工？雖然一般人都知道中國是農業國，到目前為止，我國社會經濟的基礎還建築在農業上面，國計民生，也還是靠農業來維持的。所以增加生產要從農業着手，比較的敏捷易舉，也就是所謂重點政策。可是也有少數人認為中國目前工業的發展，比較農業更重要，必須發展工業，建立大規模的機械化的生產體系，即重工業，建立，乃是中國經濟復興的基本工作。六月十二日新聞報經濟社論「論農本主義」一文可以為例，這篇評論的出發點是駁正江几虎氏「反共方案」中「實行農本敎育」一問題的，我們不想替江氏辯正，我們也認為江氏在「實行農本敎育」所列舉的理由中確有可以高榷的地方，可是「論農本主義」一文中，我們認為也有討論的餘地，因述管見，俾一般人能够明瞭現階段發展產業，復典經濟，以至改善人民生活水準，究竟應當走那一條路！</p>
<p>第一，現代化的國家誠然沒有工業不發達的，但我們要知道工業發達的國家無不由於農業的發展而來，日本是進步的工業國，但農業還是並重的，美國是應用科學最發達的國家，然而亦是農工並靈的，英國本土雖缺乏農業，可是英國的紡織工業是以澳大利亞的羊毛，印度的棉花為其後盾的，蘇聯重工業的建立在兩次五年計劃中有很顯著的跡象可尋，原是建築在農業上面的，德國是世界聞名工業最發達的國家了，但德國林業的重視和肥料的研究也是世界第一的，其他法比及荷蘭等國原皆是個工業國而無不重視農業的，在政府施政褒獎上特定有農業獎章，凡此種種，都是足夠說明工業發達的國家無不由於農業而來，要知道大部分的農業生產品均可為工業上的原料，農工原是有運繋性而不可分離的，故即使工業發達的國家，仍還不能放棄農業，那麼吾們這個工業基礎還沒有建立的國家怎能舍農業而不談，平步就勉強要他跑快步，其結果又將如何？因此從農業的發展來建設輕工業，從輕工業的發展來建設重工業，這是一定的順序而決無僥倖　等的可能，吾們並不希望中國永久滯留在原始的農業狀態之下，所以我們在竭力提倡科學，於重農之外兼重工業，中國人更應明瞭中國的國情，吾們不但希望吾國的重工業立刻建設起來，並且會實際調查過國內各地實業的情形，要是舍棄了農業，建設軍工業，便足够復典經濟，這種思想的錯誤，正和遜淸未年一般自命通曉洋務的人，主張只要船堅砲利便能打倒洋人一樣，殊不知船砲必先要有使用的人，否則堅船巨砲只能做做裝飾品，或拱手送人而巳！於事何補？所以吾們可以鄭重聲明，正告國人，重農或農本教育正切合現階段中國的要求，雖然吾們同時也要發展輕工業和建設重工業，可是農業却始終沒有放棄的理由。</p>
<p>第二，「論農本主議」一文中主張「即使要振興中國的農業，吾們以為也非從農業生產的機械化人手不可，而此亦與工業化的完成不可分離」。吾們以為要改進農業，機械化是不够的，這個名詞，引用在農業上也不甚確切，要改進農業必須使農業科學化，用曳引機來耕田，用電力來發動，這便算巳把農業包括完全了嗎？農業是綜合的科學，肥料，種子，土壤之外，氣象，病蟲害，農業工程以及耕作技術，農具等等，都必須精湛的科學研究來改進，決不是單有一些機械就能了事，何况在吾國東南農業發達的各省，作物種煩的複雜，耕地面積的分裂，及習慣遺產法的情形之下，用機械耕作非特是一件不經濟的事，且為一件不合理和不可能的事，這也是僅從理論上立論而不顧事實的一例。若小規校的使用機械農具或電力灌溉，算不上農業機械化。並且機械耕作僅為改進農業上工作之一，將來開發西南，西北時，或許可以應用的。</p>
<p>第三，「中國農村人口太多，發展新式工業，吸收農村的過剩勞慟，從而减輕人民對於農業的依存，並使土地得以更有利的被利用的辦法便成為非常必要」。吾們對農村積廿年之研究，深感在事變前因農村建設的未能預先籌劃，致都市企業逐漸發展時，使農民相率離村，農村勞力减退，便是造成農村崩潰原因之一，但要是政治上軌道，農民知識普及，農村組織健全，人口向都市集中，那也是進化的現象，到那個時候農村便可以應用科學方決以補救人力的不足了。說中國農村人口太多，這句話也有問題，吾們只知道中國農村人口分布得太不平均，東南沿海一帶，人口密集在狹小的面積上，每方公里平均一四九。四人，人口密度已達到飽和程度，而在西北每方公里的人口密度平均僅得三。四人，在西南邊疆，每方公里不足一人，有很廣的土地却沒有人耕種，這是我們親自調查的事實。同時可耕地荒廢的又隨處都是，開墾荒地還辦不到，更何能把土地更有利的被利用呢？倘不從農業本身去解決中國農村經濟的崩潰，試間是不是把荒地都建築起工廠來？這更是根本不可能的！</p>
<p>第四，採確　然不在農業範圍以內，但要是沒有了農業，全國工業化以後，試問工」人可以把礦產品來充饑嗎？捕漁不能說完全非農民的職務，在江浙一帶魚米之鄉到處都是，捕漁至少與養畜相等，是農村的副業。至於因「戰時食糧昂貴，農業可獲厚利」。因而提倡農本主義，這是絕對錯誤的見解，並且這句話是從投機的觀點來立論的，以現時社會經濟制度的不正常，農民被剝削者，農產品的市價無論高漲到如何程度，農民決得不到利潤，而所有的利益都被中間商人所佔有，因此我們要提倡農業，並不是因為可以投機獲利，相反的，要是使農民能够得到正當應得的利潤而不為中間人所巧取豪奪，認為保持國計民生，延續民族生命，惟有從農業上做起，才是正途而已！</p>
<p>歷史上中國政治的施策，都是以農業為對象的，吾們不否認把握政治與經濟的總的動向，並從而確定其應興應廢之點，是救中國於危亡的必要措置，但吾們更相信發展農業，建設農村，正是目前應把握的重點，農本主義，農本敎育，也許是不够的，必須從復興整個中國農村上着想，勿輕易入岐途綫好！</p>
<h3>美新銳航空母艦　班卡霍爾號擊沉　西太平洋面成激烈戰塲</h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十四日中央社電以塞班烏為中心之西太平洋每面，現已化為激戰烈之戰塲出勤于馬利亞納羣島海面之美海軍，乃擁有航空母艦二十艘，戰艦十餘艘及運輸船百餘艘，自六月十一日進攻馬利亞納羣島，即陸續出動于該處海面，奪取塞班島，幷與該島登陸部隊相呼應，作反覆之炮擊轟炸。日聯合艦隊之一部，為擊減敵美艦隊，亦斷然出動于馬利亞納海面，自十九日起，先發制敵，在馬利亞納羣島西方海面，進攻美著名艦隊編成之大機動部隊，戰鬥兩日後，敵艦編隊己遭痛擊，加之此次日軍參加之聯合艦隊，僅為其中一部，倘發揮全力時，馬利亞納海面，必成美太平洋艦隊葬身之地。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電敵航空母艦班卡霍爾號，自十九日至二十日，在馬利亞納海域，爲日聯合艦隊擊沉，其噸數計二萬七千噸，為一愛賽克斯級之航空母艦，裝有五吋炮十六門，載飛機八十餘架，速力每小時為三十二乃至三十五海里。</p>
<h3>大宮島空戰</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電敵空軍為呼應塞班島之登陸作戰，乃運日轟炸大宮島（關島），二十三日晨，以戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊七十架來襲該島，日航空部隊當即邀擊，某指揮官更親目駕機，突入敵機羣，與之展開壯烈空戰。是役計擊落敵機十五架（內不確者四架），日軍損害輕微，該鳥日軍航空部隊於擊退敵機後，在大宮島附近發見敵軍航空母艦，指運呂身先士卒，　機猛炸敵艦羣，投下炸彈多枚。</p>
<p>日軍某基地二十四日中央社電日軍機隊二十三日上午於塞班島海面猛襲敵機動部隊，立即重創其航空母艦二艘，日機二架未返。</p>
<h3>末次大將談　太平洋海戰　塞班島日軍準備殲敵</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電前任日聯合艦隊司令長官末次信正大將，頃於東京獲　私邸接見記者，就塞班附近海面戰事發表談話如次：日軍現於塞班島發動攻勞，吾全國國民絕不能袖手旁觀，敵機動部隊絕難自塞班島週邊逃出，蓋以敵人距離補充機珍珠灣仍有三千三百海里，且距離日本海較近，無論就歷史上元兵寇邊時，日俄戰時巴爾基庫艦隊，再古如西班牙馬爾馬建艦隊，　薩拉尼斯海戰各公例觀之，雖恃物置，但至達方作戰，絕無僥倖先例。而美敵目下又　大危險，敢行侵犯，日駐軍餋精蓄鋭，待敵甚九，此次敵軍來犯，雖云尙未予敵以減亡打擊，日艦隊將恃優勢航空丘力，對來挑戰之敵艦隊予以打擊，亦　意料中事。從來遠離本國要塞之艦隊出擊，均自取減亡，敵今竟不進危險，遽行挑戰，向塞班島行示威的登陸，敵人已如於塞班島上被宣判死刑之罪犯。此次作戰為取勝之最後機會，敵人全部被殲減之消息雖尙未傳來，今後少一剎那，即為日將士憤怒之表情，殺敵之寶貴時簡，諾君請靜待好消息傳來</p>
<h3>高瀨大佐發表談話</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電日大本營海軍報這部之高瀨五部大佐，頃就太平洋戰局發表談話，其大意謂：現敵軍因在馬紹爾至加羅林方面之兵力行使圈內，無有力之前進基地，乃以航空母艦補　此缺陷，以其所謂有力機動部隊，反攻馬利亞納方面，但敵之此稱作戰圈，其後方補給路屢次伸長，乃不得不謀作戰之短期化。反攻兵力之編成，自須格外精强，因而戰爭愈架有決戰之性格，戰爭不能僅以物量決定勝負，戰綫伸長後，物量須隨之增加，運輸亦愈感困難，於此種情形下，最難保持均行，一旦發生破綻，則全盤作戰機構　有崩潰之虞。敵軍仗持物量，此種危險尤多，至我軍之作戰內容，雖不能明言，而目的乃在衝破敵方量與距離之平衡，今乘隙一舉粉碎敵方企圖之機會已迫眉睫襲共匪約入百人後，日軍收容共匪屍體一五五具。按六月份日軍各部隊之綜合剿共戰果，計收容共匪屍體二四四具，俘虜九九人云。</p>
<h3>湖南日軍　已抵達衡山　衡陽遭受威脅漸大</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據重慶電，重慶軍當局，廿三日對外人記者團談稱，湖南日軍已達衡陽北方四十公里之衡山，目下仍在南下進擊中。其戰綫已延至九十五公里之長，對戰略具有重要性之衡陽，所遭威脅漸趨增大云。又每日電訊報之重慶特派員，亦會稱若衡陽不守，則中國東部各省，如江西·浙江·安徽·福建·及廣東北部，均將淪為孤立地位云。</p>
<h3>渝方已作悲觀論調</h3>
<p>廣州二十四日中央社電據重慶來電稱，渝行政院參事張平軍，於二十一日會見各國記者時，對長沙陷落事作悲觀之說明。謂長沙雖已陷落，而我陸上部隊及渝美空軍對日軍戰力之消耗，已盡其職責，今後恐更有若干地域，歸於日軍之手云。</p>
<h3>華北日軍最近戰果</h3>
<p>太原二十四日中」央社電華北日軍曾於六月二日在晋省東南部陵川北方地區，協力中國方面剿共軍。攻擊來襲之共匪約兩十名。共軍遭受重創，於翌日即行潰散。是役共匪傷亡九百餘。又日軍某某兩部隊，曾於六月六日，在風合嶺（浮山東北十公里）及王村附近，奇</p>

<h3>羅斯福聲稱對海戰失望</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據華盛頓消息，羅斯福總統昨在報道會議中宣稱：最近太平洋海戰時，美艦隊未能擊滅日本艦隊，渠與渠之參謀長深感失望。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據美聯社紐約電，此次參加馬利亞納西方作戰之日本機動部隊，幷非日本艦隊之主力，且亦絕非其實力之全部。以現下之戰鬥欲破壞日本海電力，尙不可能，而指明日本艦隊之實力，依然可</p>
<h3>興亞佛敎學　研究所成立</h3>

<p>緬甸方面（陸戰），哥希馬方面，敵軍爲打開伊姆法爾，哥希馬間之公路，曾以優勢兵力，聲夜反復猛攻，日軍對此據守哥希馬附近陣地以寡兵將之擊潰。自六月上旬起，變更後方陣地之配備至最適宜之戰綫，機績將敵之反攻擊潰。伊姆法爾北方，此方日軍己確保各要點，現正對伊姆法爾之敵準備進攻中。巴列爾方面，敵自七日傍晚以來，即逐見動搖，自五日起，除仍由旁遮普兵據守第一綫外，英軍部隊似已全向巴列爾方面退却，日軍與印度國民軍現正掃蕩殘敵，同時更猛追敗退之敵，十一日已佔領巴列爾東北十二公里之庫底克諾與麥比克諾兩地。又其他日軍更於十五日佔領巴列爾東北十公里之昆比及其西北方之四三六上高地。此外，更自各方面向巴列爾繼績進擊擴大戰果中。日軍得增援部隊之協力，沿公路猛攻擁有戰車之敵軍，幷於比先波爾西南及西北確保有利之地位，刻在作進擊之準備中。北緬方面，由星薩方面向北方敗走之敵空軍挺身隊及由富貢地區逐次南下敵軍，分別在加曼美慕加漁附近予以　滅，由怒江正面侵入之渝軍，由他方侵入之空軍挺身隊，經日軍之反擊，損失慘重，狼狽潰走。該方面作戰開始以來，日軍收獲戰果如次：怒江方面，六月十一日渝軍棄屍五千四百二十六具，被俘七十四人，鹵獲品計迫擊砲二十四，重輕機槍八十五，日軍戰死三百二十一名。密芝那方面，迄十二日敵遺屍二千五百。（空戰）印度戰錢已入雨期，有阻空軍之活躍，日軍陸軍機二十二日在密芝那及慕加漁方面，擊落敵大型運論機四架。</p>
<p>中部太平洋方面，塞班島之攻防戰，敵軍在有力艦隊之掩護下，繼續登陸，其丘力約有兩師，其陸海空軍之交戰，實屬空前，敵軍逐漸擴展登陸地點，佔領阿斯利特飛辦場，有着手修理之勢，日軍確保加拉邦及其東南方高地之各要點，刻在繼續血戰中。日軍迭尼安砲台，十五日猛擊掩護塞班登陸之敵艦隊，敵戰艦一隻中彈着火，十六日下午一時至三時半，由硫磺島方面航空母艦起飛之敵戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊百架，來襲日軍陣地，被擊落十一架。（未完）</p>
<h3>侵歐前綫南部　轉入壕溝戰　克恩區戰事在發展中</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社訊：　成當局昨夜稱，侵歐前綫南部，已轉入固定幸壕溝戰·</p>
<p>倫台德元帥行營二十四日中央社電　海通社戰地記者稱：過去二十四小時內，約有美軍大砲一干尊，轟擊瑟堡之外團陳地，截至目前為止，此為侵歐前綫最大隊之大砲集中，美第一軍司令有美軍三師之大砤及砲隊十一隊，用於瑟堡前綫，同時空中轟炸亦未稍息。德軍以寡敵眾之英勇，於此可見一斑，敵人利用重兵器之集中攻擊，頗有欲迅速佔領瑟堡，以免重要設備之被毀，敵方使用特殊工兵隊十隊，其目的乃欲使其軍隊安然越過德軍地雷區及各要塞。克恩區新戰事已在發展中，德機再炸奧納河套之敵大運輪船四十艘，雖損失甚重，英軍再有一師登陸，大約將向克恩進攻，過去二十四小時，諾曼第半島海面風浪甚大，使軍需之登陸頗有困難。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德軍當局發表：自六月一日以來，德軍於德國內及北法戰綫，擊落以大型四引擊轟炸機所組成之反軸心空軍機二千四百零七架。</p>
<h3>日增產增送運動　七月一日起實施</h3>
<p>－爲期三月強化夏季運輸－</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日運輪通信省爲展開夏期增產增送運動，會積極準備，二十二日之次官會議席上，決定「增產增送期問實施要綱」，於二十三日之閣議，經五島運通相報告，取得諒解後，自七月一日開始實施，斯間計為三月。本年中因戰局之要求，必須強化夏期之增產增送，爲防空襲時一時之障礙，對於煤炭及重要原料資材，更須事前大批儲藏，本年增產增送期間之重點，置於煤炭，鋼鐵，重要礦石，木材，薪炭，對於飛機用，車轉用，艦船用之物長及食糧品，更求敏捷優先運送。為使擔當生產者之認識澈底，規定交納資任者及接收資任者，以求增產與輪送化為一體。該實施要綱如次：　實施期間爲七月至九月。　主辦官廳爲運輪通信省，農商省，軍需省。　實行責任者為全陸運機關倉庫業者及港運業者，與其統制機關關係物資之生產配給機關及其統制機關。　實施目標，甲，規定煤炭，鋼鐵，重要鑛石，木材，新炭類物資之增產增送之數量，務期達到目的。乙，優先輸送航機用，車輛用及造艦船用物賽及食糧等。丙，極力增送停滯於港灣箏處之貨物。丁，樹立與實施具體計劃時，對於物資期間地區，依照情形加以適切規定。</p>
<h3>留日學生會議</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日華學會所主辦之第四次中國留日學生會，二十四日午後一時，在該會講堂舉行，出席大東亞省，文部省，中國大使館各輔導官，及留日學生三百五十名。首由該會近澤敎育部長致詞，次由東洋文化研究所長宇野圓空博士演謂，題為東洋民族之動態與自覺，旋由東京音樂學校學生奏樂，迄五時散會。</p>
<h3>東綫中部攻勢　集中四地區　維特勃斯克東南激戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德軍常局二十三日就蘇軍夏季攻勢情形發表如次：於中部戰綫，蘇軍展開之大攻勢，目下集中於四地區，第一自摩齊勒夫南方至斯摩倫斯克至奧爾夏汽車公路地區，第二為維特勃斯克兩側地區，第三自勃羅狄東方至諾維爾捷夫西方地區，第匹爲奧斯特洛夫東北方地區。此次攻勢，漸與轟伯河至拉脫維亞國境綫接近，形成至奧斯特洛夫之戰錢，而目下戰鬥焦點，仍於維特勃斯克北方。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德元首行營二十三日發表稱：東綫中部地區激戰後，蘇軍之攻勢受挫，蘇軍所形成之局部突破口，已因德軍迅速反擊而被封閉。又維特勃斯克刻正續行激戰中。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社軍事記者奧爾堡中校稱：蘇軍之夏季攻勢，僅在東綫中路發動，南路僅有砲戰及局部戰，奧斯特洛夫與維特勃斯克間砲戰加緊。斯摩倫斯克，奧爾夏公路兩側，蘇軍進攻不下二十四次之多，維特勃斯克東南，蘇以步兵七師及坦克部隊猛攻，僅在奧培爾河上有局部之突破，至昨最猶在激戰中。夏季攻勢之第一日內，敵損失至為重大，被毀坦克車七十三輛之多。今戰事雖僅限於中路，但隨時有擴展至南部之可能，南路之局部攻勢，有遠至泰諾波爾者，普利貝特南及史特里巴亦有局部戰。芬蘭戰線，蘇軍仍猛攻不已，其主力正沿通至芬蘭之第路西進，同時在伏克生與拉多加湖間亦向北挺進，拉多加湖與奧利湖間，芬軍已越史維爾河後退。茂曼斯克鐵路備，蘇軍正向貝特洛薩夫斯克推進，芬軍亦在猛烈抵抗中。</p>
<h3>義境激戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　海通社軍事記者奧爾堡稱：義大利中部戰綫安哥那與貝魯齊亞間山區中之德軍，繼績從事避離行動，未為英軍所擾。英軍在山谷中少數公路上前進時，時為地雷等障碍物所阻，現德軍己無被包圍危險，敵人己無在貝魯齊亞區突破之可能。敵軍西翼推進，已阻於格羅塞多與貝魯齊亞間，貝魯齊亞之北及西北，在台伯河與時拉西曼諾湖之問，德軍抗戰至爲激烈，使敵人無從突破，而包圍翁勃安里山問德軍之主力，特拉西曼諾西，德軍在後衛隊掩護下，己佔領山間之新陣地。</p>
<p>美國恃其豐富的物量與機械技衛，炫耀其建造量與建造速度，並以此為總反攻的根基，大量雞造自由型，勝利型等戰時標準型船。而在日本，自去年度起，全國的甲種造船所亦以更速的速度，建造各種戰時標準型船，且已相繼下水。去年度的鋼船建造量成續極佳，克復種種困難，而記錄了驚人的意志與技術的記錄。本年度各造船所更以超過去年度的建造量爲目標而邁進，根據過去一年間的經驗，由於設備的擴充與定型的統一而確立了大量生產方式，加上海國日本不屈不撓的鬥志，及世界有數的日本造船傳統，日本造船事業今正以怒濤之勢突飛猛進。五月六日，在增強戰力上收穫極大的生產戰果之去昂造船所中，播磨·三菱·三井三浩船所成續特異，而由海軍人臣表彰·茲爲探究其內容起見，特訪問三井造船所，以下爲該造船所的概況。</p>
<p>「國防獻船」</p>
<p>工場正門，高揭着Z旗，首先觸及往訪者眼簾的，是大工塲牆壁上刻著五尺見方的赤地白字：「國防獻船」。這造給所去建造量外，並擬建造更多的商船以供獻於國家。這四個大字，詳細表明了優秀工場的意氣，與洋溢於全工塲的旺盛鬥志。</p>
<p>在獻船運動上冠於全國工廠的自信中，可以感到該造船所鐵一般的意志與力量。克服種種困難而完成定造隻數以後，三月三十一日夜，產生了這獻船運動，四月十一日，負技術上資任者庭田副長，發表實施耍綱，即在這一年中，更提高生產能率，縮短竣工期，而節省下建造一艘船所需要的勞力。資材方面，亦由於研究和努力的結果，而節省了一艘船所需要的鐵材與木材·建竣定造隻數之後用這節省下來的資材與勞力，動手建造獻船納。</p>
<h3>無休息日</h3>
<p>為建造去年的定造隻數起見，每天的勞慟時閒延長二小時，且終年無休息，無星期日及節日等例假。每月的一日，十六日，為有緊急工作者的出勒日；機械力不足的職務，則用晝夜二班交替制以補其不足。預備海軍技術中將庭田尙三氏，秉着烈火般的氣魄與鐵般的意志，於去年一月底出任廠長</p>
<p>三井造船所為三井公司之一部，該工廠的性格，專以建造本公司自用船爲主，茲已採取軍隊組織，分離職分與身份，拔　新鋭，每月規定一種工場的且標，如提高考勤率，增强生產，確立規律等，集中工場的力量於一點而不斷訓練，去年七月，推行「增產六倍」的目標，每一工員均記任「獻金。獻物·獻技·獻身」的標語，以致產生了國防獻船的結晶，早先實施的職階制之確立與旺盛的精神運動，在工塲中展開着，而緊急造船命令也趁此高潮中下來了。工場中祇聞一片苦幹聲。</p>
<h3>大量生產條件</h3>
<p>此次受海軍大臣表彰的三造船所，均位於遠離東京·橫濱·大阪·神戶等重工業地帶的所在，且各有相當悠久的歷史。生產要素上的原料，設備，工作人員，動力，工塲面積等諸點，三工塲在地理條件上均佔得優秀地位。</p>
<p>臂如在二井造船所的場合，因縣內無大規模的工廠事業場，故能不斷使用停電日的設置。在工人方面素質上亦較都會為優。廠址的寬廣，在各造船所中首屈一指，這是大量生產上的必要條件。而善用這地理條件，採取聽明。遠大與研究的賢明措置，乃能刺激生產。資材管理上的遠見，與所挺資材的活用，使資材圓滑地向造船，造機部門流通，而不致浪費等待工作的時間</p>
<p>裝配修理部的木工廠長平田技師，常變更標準船種類時，以採用多數女工爲前提，幷為了使工作簡單能牽化起見，將本來是七張的圖樣分類為〇〇張，甚至每一個抽屜都愼重地在圖樣上註明。三個月之內，完成了二張圖樣。資材部的部署這時侯已經告終。其次，乃賓行改變工作班次。從工員中選擇歸還兵士昇為兵長，伍長，下士官拔擢為伍長，以熱練工為掩護隊，退至第二綫，但因杜內的規程，而在人事上引起種種障礙。平田技師堅不撒消，用張數很多的圖樣與齊備的資材主氣開手動工。拔擢的靑年伍長們，會親身體騐過戰場上每一艘船的可責，加上旺盛的氣力，體力，與感激知遇，乃捨命實行新任務，接連三盡夜不休的强行工作，其疲勞可想而知。女子挺身隊員則按着分得極細而易解的圖樣工作。詳細的分析，許多張數的圖樣，與靑年的活力，使每一艘船的建造都能嚴守日期進行。</p>
<h3>集中全力於新型船</h3>
<p>在造機部方面，徹底的分析工程，根據這分析而制定的工作程序與日程，製成了極易解的圖樣而揭示於各工作塲所。對於工作日程的責任，縱然是新應微的工人，也因此而牢記住了。這產生了工作的簡單能率化，及各部工作的速度競賽。在造船工作部方面，對新型船舶，先專事養成工員的自信。一經決定在〇月動手建造新型船時，即中途停止其他進行中的工事，先集中全力於新型船。穿孔，裝置，熔接，各種工作都專心於新型船。常然，這是暫時的當試，這方式並不是有水續性的。然二將一切力量都集中於新對象，在規定日期前竣工進水，而對於今後必須大量動員的同型船隻之建造，則在工場中巳種下了堅强的確信。</p>
<p>工場正面廣場上所揭示的一國防獻船進行表一中，船體部，機械部的能牽增進工數，鋼材殘層的利用量的曲綫，確已超過了獻船基準綫，表現出整個工場中吒盛的氣魄，而在繼緩上昇中。（翔：譯自五月廿四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>全市中小學舉行　聯合畢業典禮　陳市長躬臨給獎致訓</h3>

<p>林局長詞略謂：今天是收回租界後的第二次舉行市校聯合畢業典醴，參加的學校計中學七校，九十九人，小學九校，五百十一人。過去的教育常崇拜歐化，今後我們要　重自己的國家，提高民族精神，以極大的勇氣，向前努力。市立學校的敎師優良，學生優秀，一定能做一個新生中國的門士，使中國復興</p>
<p>陳市長詞略請：本人趁此機會，把幾個重要問題，和大家談談，大家都知這中國人並不是愚苯的，却是很聰明的。一個中國人和一個外國人相比，中國人是很優秀的，幾個中國人和幾個外國人相比，中國人就顯得不行了。現在一般社會人士，都說公務員和軍警沒有紀律，但是他們是不是中國人呢？當然是的，他們都是從社會學校和家庭中來的，他們從前也受過敎育，為什麼會違反他們的敎養呢？這原因就是組織不够嚴密和堅强，平常的國民修一交不够深刻，所以社會弄得這樣混亂，紀律這棵敗壞，這些是目前的現象，我們決不能讓第二代繼續下云，這個資任，就在各位敎職員和各位小兄弟姊妹身上。主席把軍委會的事情交給我，看見士兵和軍官的紀律都不好，地們是受過敎育的，在校時的紀律都很好，出了學校就變壞了，這口定因爲現在的靑年充滿自由思想，一且離開學校和社會接觸，劣點就暴露出來，一個國家要强盛，先要有好軍隊，好軍隊必須從陸軍小學做起，這是我個人的意見，並希望一般家長除了養成自己的好子女以外，還安知道如何養成一個好國民，</p>

<h3>米糧運滬　各地仍有留難　當局已電令澈查嚴究</h3>
<p>本市米商赴各地採辦米糧，各省市有禁運出境之說，米統會據報獲，曾電呈行政院請示辦法，經行政院通飭南京特別市及蘇浙皖三省府通飭各縣區，對於米糧之搬運，凡持有米統會頒發之護照者，不得禁運，並應一致協助，俾資調節在案。該會最近所發給五斗以上十石以下米糧搬運證明單，准許市民赴蘇州，松江，吳江，崑山，常州，無錫，宜興，常熟，嘉興，靑浦，金山，江陰，嘉善，平湖等十五縣，自由搬運米糧來滬。所有證明單式樣，業經分函蘇浙保安處，警務處，封鎖管理戍，華中鐵道公司，上海內河輸船公司，各區辦事處，轉飭保安國隊，縣警察局，檢問所，車站論局，曁各地區採辦同業公會籌備委員會查　照，凡對於執右該項證明單者，絕對予以便利，不得阻撓，乃查無錫，嘉興，嘉善等處，仍有留難等情事，實屬遠抗功令，澳視民食。常局據報後，又已電各該管機關澈查嚴究，按米糧統制委員會所發護照及證明單，所開米糧數額，均根據各產米地區之產量，並　及當地之消費，僅在其餘剩項下，准許搬運，是對各產地之民食毫無妨碍，故認為沿途留難，實有破壞法令之嫌，一經查實，定予法辦，以雜糧政</p>

<h3>中區車輛行駛　訂定整理規則　第一警局維變交通秩序</h3>
<p>本市第一區警務常局，爲强化交通秩序，維護行人安全，特訂定車輛行駛臨時整理規則，及交通運警臨時處罰規定，即日起予以實施。記者頃訪問第一警察局行政處長呂琪，承發表談話，略謂。。「本市因人口稠密，交通情形夙稱繁雜。自三輪車之新興，及租界接收後原有各公私車　行駛之界限，亦已不復存在，於是中心地區，交通車輛益形雜沓。警務常局自始即予以密切注意，在　盧民衆便利之原則下，隨時整理取締。但目前交通秩序問題，日趨嚴重，尤以中心地區各道路為甚，一般東輛駕駛人，復忽視交通規則，任意行駛，致使交通秩序，態見紊亂。本局鑒於此種情形，不得不採取　效對策，乃決定規定宣廳行駛臨時整理規則，　方對中心地區各道路，如南京路，靜安寺路，西　路，寗夏路，禁止二一輸車人力車空車之行駛，及停放，如四川路，福州路，江西路，河南路，則禁止三輪東人力車空車之停放，蓋三輪車及人力車空車，最足妨害交迪秩序，而三輸車及人力車之　駛人，亦最不注意交通規則也。此外更規定交通　臨時處罰規定，對橫路阻　交通之車輛，特定罰則，對運反交通規則，其他規定事項者，按原訂罰金加兩倍處罰，俾使知所警惕。所有規定之車鑼行駛臨時整理規則，及交通遠警臨時處罰規定，日內即將佈告實行，由各分局交通崗警，　厲執行，而各交通繁服務之動情，亦隨時派員嚴加督察，務使規定澈底執行，惟一方面仍在市民之協力合作。本人月前赴“考察警政，以東京交電淸形之繁雜，但未見有　通警察，行人車輛均循序進行，毫無　　，足見國家之進步，人民敎育之普及，於交通秩序一點上，已彌足表現也」。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　選擇學院的　錯誤觀念</h3>
<p>— 凌華健</p>
<p>——獻給本屆高中畢業生</p>
<p>根據多年的求學經騐，我覺得一般高中畢業生，對於選擇學院，都有一種錯誤的觀念，此種觀念及其後果，可分二方言之：</p>
<p>（一）多數自以為天資後人，不求上進，以混得一紙文憑為目標的學生，都選文學商學等院，因為可以功課輕鬆,生活优閒；於是，四年之後就造也了一批不學無術，講究「派頭」的美國式空論政治家，寫入文學家，囤積銀行家等。</p>
<p>（二）一般有思想的學生，鑒於國家的貧弱，由於工業及科學家的落後，於是多人工程和理化等院，一心理首畫本，以圖他日報國，因之，有許多讀出了肺病，有許多變成了不知外事的書蛀虫，對於國家民族仍舊鮮有裨益。</p>
<p>當然在各院里，也都有眞正懂得求學眞諦的好學生；但是，對於多數學生的錯誤，我們却非糾正不可，因為一國之富强，自無疑義；然工業與科學之發達，却非先有上軌之政治經濟環境不可；由是觀之，政治經濟等之責任，自較理工諸院學生更重，而現在此二院中，反充滿混堊之業，敎他們負起改良國家環境的根本責任，豈可得哉？而同時一班有為的青年，却在死讀書下斷送了終生，如此而望將來國家的富强，豈可得哉？補救之法，亦可自二方言之：</p>
<p>（一）提高文商諸院之水凖，並施嚴格之道德及體育訓練，使糊塗及偷懶份子，不得混跡其中而為將來社會國家之害。</p>
<p>（二）理工諸院，不妨稍趨功利主義，注重實用科學，而對於過份深奧之純科學理論，在可能范圍以內不妨稍為忽過，使學生得有服從事增强體格之活動。</p>
<p>此祇大意而已，詳細改善綱目，尚有待敎育人士之擬定，如依此法改良，則國家之富有，民族之强盛，自可指日而致也。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>海軍書家（七）</p>
<p>要來的一瓶啤酒，降夫稍微喝了一點，而　人也喝了一杯，於是臉上掛了一層薄薄的紅色，很快樂地，放下叉子說：</p>
<p>「你跑到東京來，想當畫家，老實說，我是知道的艦……」</p>
<p>「儂說那能？」</p>
<p>隆夫不知不覺地說出了一句家鄉土話。眞人也用家鄉的土話說：</p>
<p>「不久前，五十鈴號軍艦上來參觀，才知道儂在東京。偏巧儂變了樣，蓄下長髪，所以碰到也未必敢認識儂。」</p>
<p>兩個人後來便開始說標準國語。</p>
<p>「那末家嚴告訴你關於我學輩的目的了麼？」</p>
<p>「呵，聽到了，說你希望當海洋畫家。你小時就喜歡海，是吧？」</p>
<p>「不，已經不想當海洋畫家了。我想當海軍畫家。」</p>
<p>「想當海軍畫家？」</p>
<p>「是想描寫海軍的精神和美的。畫軍艦，也畫海戰……。同時也畫軍人……。有人說那是廣告畫，我眞有點不明白。」</p>
<p>隆夫一揩嘴唇上的啤酒沫，還在發方才的脾氣，但眞人是不明白的。</p>
<p>「但你爸爸說人的討厭海軍而才當畫家……」</p>
<p>「不要說這個了吧！我有點臉紅了。」</p>
<p>隆夫把長長的頭髪撩到頭頂上去，說：「男人一旦下了決心，是不容易再改的。我雖然下了決心，但我的理智是不答應我的。或許我還是未成熟的人。我現在旣當不了海軍士官，而就想當海軍畫家，這種心一決定，就好想百年的迷夢業已覺醒。從今而後，就打算終身研究海軍了，所以眞人也幫我一點忙吧！」</p>
<p>「恐怕幫不上忙，只要能幫得上，什么都可以。但現在可好了，我曾有過一個時候，非常担心你的事情，甚至有的夜里不能入睡。」</p>
<p>「眞對不起。眞人，我雖極端羨慕你，但並不想給你寫信。」</p>
<p>「可是你的身體怎樣了？」</p>
<p>「說起來很奇怪，雖然考海兵和海軍雷等學校不及格，甚至徵兵也未妥，但自身從到東京來以後，一次也未曾生過病。我的身體縱不適合於軍人，但畫家總歸可以的。」</p>
<p>隆夫這樣說着，而眞人就爽快地報之以笑。於是不知不覺，又回到五年前那樣兩小無猜，而海闊天空地談論着。（一〇六）</p>

<h3>Weekly Review: Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>— Liao Jianan</p>
<p>Recently, many people have questioned whether, at this stage of developing China's industry and revitalizing the economy, we should prioritize agriculture or industry. While most people know that China is an agricultural country and that, to date, the foundation of our society and economy is still built on agriculture, with the national economy and people's livelihoods still dependent on it. Therefore, increasing production should start with agriculture, which is relatively quick and easy, and is what is meant by a key policy. However, some people believe that the development of industry is more important than agriculture in China today. We must develop industry and establish a large-scale, mechanized production system, that is, heavy industry. Its establishment is the fundamental task of China's economic revival. The June 12th *Xinwenbao* (News Daily) editorial, "On Agriculturalism," can be taken as an example. The starting point of this commentary is to refute Jiang Jihu's "Anti-Communist Plan" regarding the issue of "implementing agricultural fundamental education." We do not want to defend Jiang, and we also believe that there are indeed debatable points in the reasons Jiang listed for "implementing agricultural fundamental education." However, we believe there is also room for discussion in the "On Agriculturalism" article. Therefore, we are stating our humble views so that the general public can understand which path should be taken at this stage of industrial development, economic recovery, and improvement of people's living standards!</p>
<p>First, it is true that no modern country can develop without a developed industry, but we must know that the development of industrialized countries invariably stems from the development of agriculture. Japan is a progressive industrialized country, but it still attaches equal importance to agriculture. The United States is the country with the most advanced applied science, yet it also values both agriculture and industry. Although the British Isles lacks agriculture, Britain's textile industry is backed by Australian wool and Indian cotton. The establishment of Soviet heavy industry during the two Five-Year Plans has obvious signs to be found, and it was originally built on agriculture. Germany is a world-renowned country with the most developed industry, but Germany's emphasis on forestry and research on fertilizers is also the best in the world. Other countries such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are all industrial countries that attach great importance to agriculture, and special agricultural medals are awarded in government policies. All of these are sufficient to illustrate that the development of industrialized countries invariably stems from agriculture. It should be known that most agricultural products can be used as raw materials for industry, and agriculture and industry are inherently interconnected and inseparable. Therefore, even industrialized countries still cannot abandon agriculture. How can we, a country whose industrial base has not yet been established, abandon agriculture and try to run before we can walk? What will be the result? Therefore, constructing light industry from the development of agriculture, and constructing heavy industry from the development of light industry, is a certain sequence, and there is no possibility of luck. We do not hope that China will permanently remain in a primitive agricultural state, so we are making every effort to promote science, emphasizing both industry and agriculture. Chinese people should be more aware of China's national conditions. We not only hope that our country's heavy industry will be established immediately, but we have also actually investigated the state of industry in various parts of the country. To abandon agriculture and build military industry as sufficient to restore the economy is as erroneous a way of thinking as that of those who claimed to be familiar with foreign affairs in the late Qing Dynasty, arguing that as long as ships were strong and cannons were powerful, they could defeat foreigners. They did not know that ships and cannons must first have people to use them; otherwise, strong ships and cannons can only be used as decorations or given away! What good would that do? Therefore, we can solemnly declare and inform the people of the country that prioritizing agriculture or agricultural fundamental education is precisely in line with the current needs of China. Although we must also develop light industry and build heavy industry at the same time, there is no reason to abandon agriculture at any time.</p>
<p>Second, the "On Agriculturalism" article advocates that "Even if we want to revitalize China's agriculture, we believe that we must start with the mechanization of agricultural production, and this is inseparable from the completion of industrialization." We believe that mechanization is not enough to improve agriculture. This term is not very accurate when used in agriculture. To improve agriculture, agriculture must be scientific. Is using tractors to cultivate fields and using electricity to power equipment sufficient to encompass agriculture completely? Agriculture is a comprehensive science. In addition to fertilizers, seeds, and soil, meteorology, pests and diseases, agricultural engineering, and cultivation techniques, agricultural tools, etc., must all be improved with sophisticated scientific research. It is definitely not something that can be accomplished with just some machinery. Moreover, in the provinces where agriculture is developed in southeastern China, the complexity of crop types, the division of cultivated land, and the situation of customary inheritance laws make mechanical cultivation not only uneconomical but also irrational and impossible. This is another example of arguing from theory without regard to the facts. The use of mechanical agricultural tools or electric irrigation on a small scale does not count as agricultural mechanization. Moreover, mechanical cultivation is only one of the tasks to improve agriculture and may be applicable when developing the southwest and northwest in the future.</p>
<p>Third, "China has too many rural people. Developing new industries to absorb the surplus labor in rural areas, thereby reducing the people's dependence on agriculture, and making it possible to use the land more advantageously, has become very necessary." We have conducted 20 years of research on rural areas, and we deeply feel that before the Incident, due to the failure to plan rural construction in advance, when urban enterprises gradually developed, farmers were induced to leave their villages, and the decline of rural labor was one of the reasons for the collapse of rural areas. However, if politics is on the right track, farmers' knowledge is popularized, and rural organizations are sound, the concentration of population in cities is also a phenomenon of evolution. At that time, rural areas can apply scientific methods to make up for the lack of manpower. There is also a problem with saying that China has too many rural people. We only know that the distribution of the rural population in China is too uneven. In the southeastern coastal areas, the population is densely concentrated in a small area, averaging 149.4 people per square kilometer, and the population density has reached saturation. In the northwest, the population density averages only 3.4 people per square kilometer. In the southwestern border areas, there are fewer than one person per square kilometer. There is a lot of land, but no one is cultivating it. This is a fact we have personally investigated. At the same time, abandoned arable land is everywhere, and it is still impossible to reclaim wasteland. How can we use the land more advantageously? If we do not solve the collapse of China's rural economy from agriculture itself, is it possible to build factories on all the wasteland? This is even more fundamentally impossible!</p>
<p>Fourth, mining is indeed not within the scope of agriculture, but if there is no agriculture after the entire country is industrialized, can the workers fill their stomachs with mineral products? Fishing cannot be said to be completely unrelated to farmers' duties. In the land of fish and rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is everywhere. Fishing is at least equal to animal husbandry and is a sideline of rural areas. As for promoting agriculturalism because "food is expensive during wartime, and agriculture can obtain huge profits," this is an absolutely wrong view, and this statement is based on a speculative point of view. Due to the abnormality of the current social and economic system, farmers are exploited. No matter how high the market price of agricultural products rises, farmers will not get profits, and all the benefits will be occupied by middlemen. Therefore, we want to promote agriculture, not because we can speculate and make profits. On the contrary, we want to enable farmers to obtain the legitimate profits they deserve and not be cleverly exploited by middlemen, believing that maintaining the national economy and people's livelihoods and continuing the life of the nation can only be achieved by starting with agriculture, which is the right path!</p>
<p>Historically, China's political policies have been aimed at agriculture. We do not deny that grasping the general trend of politics and economy, and thus determining what should be promoted and what should be abolished, is a necessary measure to save China from danger and death. However, we believe more that developing agriculture and building rural areas are the key points to grasp at present. Agriculturalism and agricultural fundamental education may not be enough. We must think from the perspective of revitalizing the entire Chinese countryside. Do not easily go astray!</p>
<h3>US New Aircraft Carrier *Bunker Hill* Sunk; Fierce Battle on Western Pacific</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from a Japanese Base, 24th: The Western Pacific, centered on Saipan and Guam, has now become a battlefield of fierce fighting. The US Navy, operating in the waters off the Mariana Islands, possesses 20 aircraft carriers, more than 10 battleships, and more than 100 transport ships. Since the invasion of the Mariana Islands on June 11, they have been successively dispatched to the waters off the islands to seize Saipan, responding to the landing forces on the island, and conducting repeated bombardments and bombings. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet was also decisively dispatched to the Mariana waters to strike and reduce the enemy's US fleet. Since the 19th, it has launched a preemptive strike, attacking the large mobile unit formed by the famous US fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands. After two days of fighting, the enemy fleet has been severely hit. In addition, the Japanese Combined Fleet participating in this battle is only a part of it. If its full power is exerted, the Mariana waters will surely become the burial ground of the US Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: The enemy aircraft carrier *Bunker Hill* was sunk by the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Mariana waters from the 19th to the 20th. Its tonnage is 27,000 tons and it is an *Essex*-class aircraft carrier, equipped with 16 five-inch guns, carrying more than 80 aircraft, and with a speed of 32 to 35 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Over Omiya Island (Guam)</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: The enemy air force, in response to the Saipan landing operation, bombed Omiya Island (Guam) on the morning of the 23rd, with a combined formation of 70 fighter-bombers attacking the island. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them. A certain commander personally piloted a plane and broke into the enemy aircraft group, engaging in a heroic air battle. In this battle, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 4 unconfirmed), and the Japanese army suffered minor damage. After repelling the enemy aircraft, the Japanese air force on the island discovered an enemy aircraft carrier near Omiya Island. Commander Shiun led the way and fiercely bombed the enemy fleet, dropping many bombs.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from a Japanese Base, 24th: On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy mobile unit in the waters off Saipan, immediately severely damaging two of its aircraft carriers. Two Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3>Admiral Suetsugu Discusses the Pacific Naval Battle: Japanese Army on Saipan Prepared to Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, recently received reporters at his private residence in Tokyo and made the following remarks regarding the battle in the waters near Saipan: The Japanese army is now launching an attack on Saipan, and the people of the whole country must not stand idly by. It will be difficult for the enemy's mobile unit to escape from the periphery of Saipan, because the enemy is still 3,300 nautical miles away from Pearl Harbor, the replenishment base, and is closer to the Sea of Japan. Whether from the Yuan army's incursions on the border in history, the Baltic Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, or the Spanish Malma-built fleet and the Battle of Sarannis, there is no precedent for good fortune in reaching the operational area relying on objects. The American enemy is currently in great danger and dares to invade. The Japanese garrison has been preparing and waiting for the enemy. Although this enemy attack has not yet inflicted a destructive blow on the enemy, the Japanese fleet will rely on its superior air power to strike the enemy fleet that comes to challenge. The enemy fleet that is far away from its home base has always destroyed itself by attacking. The enemy is now in danger and dares to challenge us, launching a demonstration landing on Saipan. The enemy is like a criminal sentenced to death on Saipan. This operation is the last chance to win. Although the news of the complete annihilation of the enemy has not yet arrived, the next moment will be a precious moment for the Japanese soldiers to express their anger and kill the enemy. Please wait quietly for good news.</p>
<h3>Colonel Takase Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: Colonel Goro Takase of the Navy Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters recently issued a statement on the Pacific war situation, the gist of which is: The enemy is now using aircraft carriers to compensate for the lack of a strong forward base within the sphere of influence of its forces in the Marshall and Caroline Islands, and is using its so-called powerful mobile unit to counterattack the Mariana Islands. However, the rear supply route of the enemy's so-called operational sphere has been repeatedly extended, and it has to plan for the shortening of operations. The organization of the counterattack force must be particularly strong, so the war is becoming increasingly decisive. The war cannot be decided by material quantity alone. After the battle line is extended, the amount of material must be increased accordingly, and transportation becomes more difficult. Under such circumstances, it is most difficult to maintain equilibrium. Once a flaw occurs, the entire operational organization is in danger of collapsing. The enemy army relies on material quantity, and this danger is even greater. As for the content of our army's operations, although it cannot be stated clearly, the purpose is to break the balance between the enemy's quantity and distance. Now, the opportunity to take advantage of the gap to smash the enemy's intentions has come. After about 100 Communist bandits attacked, the Japanese army collected 155 bodies of Communist bandits. According to the comprehensive anti-Communist results of the Japanese army in June, a total of 244 bodies of Communist bandits were collected and 99 people were captured.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Hunan Reaches Hengshan; Threat to Hengyang Increases</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 24th: According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military authorities told foreign reporters on the 23rd that the Japanese army in Hunan has reached Hengshan, 40 kilometers north of Hengyang, and is still advancing south. Its battle line has been extended to a length of 95 kilometers, and the threat to Hengyang, which is strategically important, is gradually increasing. The Chongqing correspondent of the *Daily Telegraph* also stated that if Hengyang is not defended, the eastern provinces of China, such as Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and northern Guangdong, will be isolated.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Pessimistic Tone</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Telegram from Guangzhou, 24th: According to a telegram from Chongqing, Zhang Pingjun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, made a pessimistic explanation of the fall of Changsha when he met with foreign reporters on the 21st. He said that although Changsha has fallen, our land forces and the US Air Force in Chongqing have done their duty to consume the Japanese military's combat power. In the future, some more areas may fall into the hands of the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>East Asia Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Weekly war situation on the East Asian front:</p>
<p>China Front (Land Warfare): In the Chao'nan area, since the start of operations, Japanese forces have defeated fifteen divisions of the Chongqing army and successively occupied key locations in Hunan, including Changsha, Liuyang, Liling, Ningxiang, and Xiangxiang. They are now advancing towards Hengyang, the air base of the Chongqing and American forces. Japanese naval units, cooperating in Hunan,突入 (tū rù - suddenly entered) the coast 40 kilometers north of Changsha on the 17th, securing the waterway from Baidongting Lake port to Changsha. In the Henan area, after defeating the troops of the First War Zone, Japanese forces engaged in a battle south of Lingbao. From the 1st to the 14th, the results included: 5,177 Chongqing army corpses, 538 captured, 20 Chongqing/American aircraft shot down (7 unconfirmed), and the seizure of 7 mortars, 110 heavy and light machine guns, and 1,559 rifles. Japanese casualties numbered 421. (Air Warfare): In addition to closely supporting land operations, Japanese air units frequently seized opportunities to raid Chongqing army air bases, thoroughly defeating the enemy's war-making capabilities. The arrival of Chongqing and American aircraft totaled 143 times in mid-June, involving 746 aircraft. Japanese forces shot down 16 of them (4 unconfirmed), destroyed 16, and caused 12 to catch fire, totaling 44.</p>
<p>Burma Front (Land Warfare): In the Kohima area, the enemy forces, in an attempt to open the highway between Imphal and Kohima, repeatedly launched fierce attacks day and night with superior forces. Japanese forces, defending positions near Kohima with a smaller force, defeated them. Starting from early June, they changed the disposition of rear positions to the most suitable battle lines, repeatedly repelling enemy counterattacks. North of Imphal, Japanese forces have secured key points and are preparing to attack the enemy in Imphal. In the Palel area, the enemy had been showing signs of wavering since the evening of the 7th. Since the 5th, except for Punjabi troops holding the front line, British units appeared to have completely retreated towards Palel. Japanese forces and the Indian National Army are currently mopping up the remaining enemy forces, while also fiercely pursuing the retreating enemy. On the 11th, they occupied Koodi Khunou and Mapik Khunou, located 12 kilometers northeast of Palel. Furthermore, on the 15th, other Japanese forces occupied Kungbi, located 10 kilometers northeast of Palel, and the high ground 436 to its northwest. In addition, they are continuing to attack towards Palel from various directions, expanding their gains. With the cooperation of reinforcement units, Japanese forces are fiercely attacking enemy troops with tanks along the highway and securing advantageous positions southwest and northwest of Bishnupur, currently preparing for an advance. In northern Burma, enemy airborne units retreating north from the Sinssat area and enemy forces gradually moving south from the Hpungan area were annihilated near Kamaing and Myitkyina, respectively. Chongqing army forces invading from the Nu River front and airborne units invading from other areas suffered heavy losses and fled in disarray after Japanese counterattacks. Since the start of operations in this area, Japanese forces have achieved the following results: Nu River front: As of June 11th, the Chongqing army had left behind 5,426 corpses, with 74 captured. The seized items include 24 mortars and 85 heavy and light machine guns. Japanese casualties numbered 321. Myitkyina area: As of the 12th, the enemy had abandoned 2,500 bodies. (Air Warfare): The Indian front has entered the rainy season, hindering air force activity. Japanese army aircraft shot down 4 large enemy transport aircraft in the Myitkyina and Myitkyina areas on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Front: In the battle for Saipan, enemy forces, under the cover of a strong fleet, continued to land, with an estimated strength of about two divisions. The battle involving their land, sea, and air forces is unprecedented. Enemy forces are gradually expanding their landing points and have occupied Aslito Airfield, appearing to be starting repairs. Japanese forces have secured key points in Garapan and the high ground to its southeast and are continuing to fight fiercely. The Japanese artillery on Tinian Island heavily shelled the enemy fleet covering the Saipan landing on the 15th, with one enemy battleship hit and set on fire. From 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the 16th, a combined formation of 100 enemy fighter-bombers, launched from aircraft carriers from Iwo Jima, attacked Japanese positions, with 11 shot down.

<h3>European Front, South: Transition to Trench Warfare, Battles Developing in the Caen Sector</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports: Authorities stated last night that the southern European front has transitioned to fixed trench warfare.</p>
<p>Marshal Rundstedt's Headquarters, 24th (Central News Agency) - A Havas war correspondent reports: In the past 24 hours, approximately 1,000 American artillery pieces bombarded the outer perimeter positions of Cherbourg. This is the largest concentration of artillery seen so far on the European front. The commander of the U.S. First Army has deployed three American divisions and eleven artillery groups on the Cherbourg front. Aerial bombardment has also continued without pause. The German army's courage in fighting against overwhelming odds is evident. The enemy's concentrated attacks with heavy weaponry aim to quickly occupy Cherbourg to prevent the destruction of important facilities. The enemy is using ten special engineer units to enable their troops to safely cross German minefields and fortifications. New battles are developing in the Caen sector. German aircraft bombed 40 enemy transport ships in the Orne River estuary again. Despite heavy losses, another British division has landed and is likely to advance on Caen. In the past 24 hours, the seas off the Normandy peninsula have been very rough, making the landing of supplies difficult.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced that since June 1st, German forces have shot down 2,407 Allied aircraft, composed of large four-engine bombers, over Germany and the northern French front.</p>

<h3>Central Offensive on the Eastern Front: Concentrated in Four Areas, Fierce Fighting Southeast of Vitebsk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, the German command announced the situation of the Soviet summer offensive as follows: The major offensive launched by the Soviet army on the central front is currently concentrated in four areas: first, the area from south of Mogilev to the Smolensk-Orsha highway; second, the areas on both sides of Vitebsk; third, the area from east of Borody to west of Nevel; and fourth, the area northeast of Ostrov. This offensive is gradually approaching the line from the Berezina River to the Latvian border, forming the front line to Ostrov. The focus of the fighting remains north of Vitebsk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's Headquarters announced on the 23rd that after fierce fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive was挫折 (cuò zhé - frustrated). The local breakthroughs formed by the Soviet army have been closed by swift German counterattacks. Fierce fighting continues in Vitebsk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas military correspondent Lieutenant Colonel Orb reported: The Soviet summer offensive has only been launched in the central sector of the Eastern Front. There has only been artillery fire and local battles in the southern sector. Artillery fire has intensified between Ostrov and Vitebsk. The Soviet army has attacked the Smolensk-Orsha highway more than twenty-four times. Southeast of Vitebsk, the Soviets launched a fierce attack with seven infantry divisions and tank units, achieving only a local breakthrough on the Obel River. The fighting was still intense as of yesterday. The enemy suffered significant losses on the first day of the summer offensive, with 73 tanks destroyed. Although the fighting is currently limited to the central sector, there is a possibility of it expanding to the southern sector at any time. The local offensive in the southern sector extends as far as Ternopol. There have also been local battles south of Pripet and Stryi. On the Finnish front, the Soviet army continues to attack fiercely. Its main force is advancing along the road to Finland, while also advancing north between the Vuksa and Ladoga lakes. Between Ladoga Lake and Lake Onega, Finnish forces have retreated beyond the Svir River. On the Murmansk Railway, the Soviet army is advancing towards Petrozavodsk, and Finnish forces are also fiercely resisting.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas military correspondent Orb reported: German forces in the mountainous area between Ancona and Perugia on the central Italian front continue to conduct avoidance maneuvers, undisturbed by British forces. The British army's progress along the few roads in the valley is hindered by mines and other obstacles. There is no longer any danger of the German army being encircled, and the enemy has no possibility of breaking through in the Perugia area. The enemy's advance on the western flank has been stopped between Grosseto and Perugia. North and northwest of Perugia, between the Tiber River and Lake Trasimeno, German resistance is extremely fierce, preventing the enemy from breaking through and encircling the main force of the German army in the mountains of Umbria. West of Trasimeno, German forces, under the cover of the rearguard, have occupied new positions in the mountains.</p>
<p>The United States, relying on its abundant resources and mechanical technology, flaunts its construction volume and speed and uses this as the foundation for its general counteroffensive, mass-producing wartime standard ships such as the Liberty type and Victory type. In Japan, since last year, the nation's Class A shipyards have also been building various wartime standard ships at an even faster pace, and they have been launched one after another. Last year's steel ship construction volume was excellent, overcoming various difficulties, and recording an amazing record of will and technology. This year, each shipyard is advancing with the goal of exceeding last year's construction volume. Based on the experience of the past year, mass production methods have been established due to the expansion of equipment and the unification of designs, coupled with the indomitable fighting spirit of maritime Japan and Japan's world-renowned shipbuilding tradition. Japan's shipbuilding industry is now advancing by leaps and bounds with the force of a raging tide. On May 6, at the Kure Naval Arsenal, which achieved a great production result in strengthening war power, the achievements of the Harima, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui shipyards were particularly outstanding, and they were commended by the Minister of the Navy. In order to explore its contents, we visited the Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant, and the following is an overview of the plant.</p>
<p>"National Defense Dedicated Ship"</p>
<p>At the factory's main gate, the Z flag is hoisted high. What first catches the eye of visitors is the five-foot-square white characters on a red background carved on the wall of the workshop: "National Defense Dedicated Ship." In addition to the construction volume designated for the factory, it plans to build more merchant ships to dedicate to the country. These four large characters clearly indicate the意氣 (yì qì - spirit) of the excellent factory and the旺盛 (wàng shèng - exuberant) fighting spirit that permeates the entire factory.</p>
<p>In the confidence that it is leading the nation's factories in the ship dedication movement, one can feel the iron-like will and strength of the shipyard. After overcoming various difficulties and completing the designated number of ships, on the night of March 31, this ship dedication movement was born. On April 11, Deputy Chief Takeda, responsible for technical matters, announced the implementation guidelines. That is, in this year, further improve production efficiency, shorten the completion period, and save the labor required to build a ship. In terms of materials, as a result of research and effort, the iron and wood required for a ship were also saved. After completing the designated number of ships, use the saved materials and labor to build献船 (xiàn chuán - dedicated ships) to be delivered.</p>
<h3>No Days Off</h3>
<p>In order to build last year's designated number of ships, the daily working hours were extended by two hours, and there were no days off, no Sundays, and no holidays throughout the year. The 1st and 16th of each month were days for those with urgent work to report to work. For jobs where mechanical power was insufficient, a day and night shift system was used to make up for the shortage. Rear Admiral (Technical) Takeda Shōzō, with a spirit like a raging fire and a will of iron, took office as the factory manager at the end of January last year.</p>
<p>The Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant is a part of the Mitsui Company. The factory's character is mainly to build ships for its own use. It has now adopted a military organization, separating positions and identities,抜擢 (bá zhuó - promote) new talents, and setting a goal for each factory every month, such as improving attendance, increasing production, and establishing discipline, focusing the factory's strength on one point and constantly training. In July last year, the goal of "six times increase in production" was promoted. Every worker memorized the slogan of "Donation of money, donation of goods, donation of skills, dedication of self," which resulted in the結晶 (jié jīng - crystallization) of the national defense ship. The establishment of the job title system and the vigorous spiritual movement carried out earlier were unfolding in the factory, and the emergency shipbuilding order also came down during this upsurge. The factory only heard the sound of hard work.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Mass Production</h3>
<p>The three shipyards commended by the Minister of the Navy this time are all located far away from the heavy industrial zones of Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe, and each has a relatively long history. In terms of production factors such as raw materials, equipment, personnel, power, and factory area, the three factories all occupy excellent positions in terms of geographical conditions.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of the Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant, because there are no large-scale factories and business locations in the prefecture, it is possible to constantly use the setting of power outage days. The quality of workers is also superior to that of cities. The vastness of the factory site is second to none among shipyards, which is a necessary condition for mass production. The ability to make good use of these geographical conditions and adopt measures that are intelligent, far-sighted, and research-oriented can stimulate production. The foresight in material management and the utilization of materials in hand allow materials to circulate smoothly to the shipbuilding and engine manufacturing departments without wasting time waiting for work.</p>
<p>Hirata, the chief engineer of the carpentry factory in the fitting and repair department, often changed the standard ship types. On the premise of employing a large number of female workers, and in order to simplify the work, he classified the original seven drawings into 〇〇 drawings, and even carefully noted each drawer on the drawings. Within three months, two drawings were completed. The deployment of the materials department was completed at this time. Next, the work shift was changed. Soldiers who had returned from the army were selected from the workers and promoted to corporal, sergeant, and non-commissioned officer, and skilled workers were promoted to squad leader to serve as escorts. They retreated to the second line, but due to the regulations within the department, various obstacles arose in personnel matters. Technician Hirata firmly refused to withdraw and, with a large number of drawings and readily available materials, took the lead. The promoted young squad leaders had personally experienced the responsibility of each ship on the battlefield, coupled with vigorous energy, physical strength, and gratitude for their遇 (yù - encountered) the recognition, they risked their lives to carry out new tasks, working hard for three consecutive nights without rest. Their fatigue can be imagined. The female members of the 挺身隊 (tǐng shēn duì - volunteer corps) worked according to the extremely detailed and easy-to-understand drawings. The detailed analysis, the many drawings, and the vitality of the young people ensured that the construction of each ship could proceed on schedule.</p>
<h3>Concentrate All Efforts on New Model Ships</h3>
<p>In the engine manufacturing department, the process was thoroughly analyzed, and the work procedures and schedules formulated based on this analysis were made into extremely easy-to-understand drawings and displayed in each workshop. Even newly hired workers remembered the responsibility for the work schedule. This resulted in the simplification and efficiency of work, and the speed competition among the departments. In the shipbuilding department, the focus was on cultivating workers' confidence in new types of ships. Once it was decided to start building a new type of ship in 〇 month, the other ongoing projects were stopped midway, and all efforts were concentrated on the new type of ship. Drilling, installation, welding, and all kinds of work were focused on the new type of ship. Of course, this was a temporary attempt, and this method was not sustainable. However, by concentrating all forces on the new object, completing it before the scheduled date, and launching it, a firm conviction was sown in the factory for the construction of the same type of ships that must be mobilized in large quantities in the future.</p>
<p>In the "National Defense Ship Progress Chart" displayed on the square in front of the factory, the curves of the ship body department and the mechanical department's increased 工數 (gōng shù - man-hours) and the utilization of steel residue have indeed exceeded the ship dedication baseline, showing the盛 (shèng - flourishing) vigor of the entire factory and gradually rising. (翔: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, May 24th)</p>

<h3>First District Office: Discussing Improvement of Transportation, Transportation Improvement Committee Resolves Three Measures</h3>
<p>In order to improve the transportation order within the Ningbo district and to enhance the convenience and safety of citizens in transportation, the First District Office of the city has established a "Transportation Improvement Committee." The committee held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month in the conference room of the First District Office. The attendees included Chairman Wu (District Chief), standing committee members Zhang Jianchu, Xu Guansan, and Jiang Shoubao Ping, committee members Bo Bian Ding, Chen Shantong, Wu Genyuan, Mr. Fan (Vice Consul, representative of the Japanese Consulate), Mr. Huang Rong (representative of the Municipal Public Works Bureau), and observers Liang Senzhang, Qu Sunyi, Xi Lemin, and Sha Guozheng. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wu. The important issues raised for discussion included the following: The issue that the police department is somewhat estranged because vehicle licenses are currently issued by the Public Works Bureau, and that the two parties should maintain close contact. Resolved that the Public Works Bureau should send a copy of each vehicle license to the First Police Department for record as soon as possible after issuance. The issue of amending the traffic regulations established by the former Public Works Bureau to facilitate travel. Resolved that the Traffic Section of the First Police Department should draft a proposal within one week, submit it for review, and then submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The issue of promptly restoring the former rickshaw parking lots, adding parking lots for rickshaws and tricycles, and that empty cars should not be allowed to travel or stop on designated trunk roads in order to maintain traffic order. Resolved that the First Police Department should handle this matter in advance, with the assistance of the Public Works Department to erect parking lot signs. Subsequently, Chairman Wu announced: The establishment of this committee is because the transportation problems in this district urgently need to be improved. It is hoped that all committee members will pay close attention to any issues related to transportation in the future and conduct detailed examinations. This committee will convene a regular meeting every two weeks.</p>
<h3>Joint Graduation Ceremony Held by All Primary and Secondary Schools in the City, Mayor Chen Personally Present to Award Prizes and Deliver Instructions</h3>
<p>The second joint graduation ceremony of the municipal primary and secondary schools of this city was solemnly held at the Great Light Grand Theater at 9:30 AM yesterday (24th). Officials present included Mayor Chen, Director of Education Lin Jiong'an, Executive Director of the Education Association Zhou Huarren, Chief of the Education Office of the First District Office Tan Tiankai, President Chen of this newspaper, and guests from all walks of life, as well as more than two thousand graduates from all primary and secondary schools, gathered together, and the mood was熱烈 (rè liè - enthusiastic). The ceremony proceeded as planned. First, Chairman Lin, Director of Education, delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mayor Chen's instructions. The mayor then presented graduation certificates and awarded prizes. Afterwards, the faculty and staff of all municipal primary and secondary schools jointly presented Mayor Chen with a silver鼎 (dǐng - tripod) to express their gratitude. Subsequently, the student representative from Kangle Road Primary School delivered a farewell speech, and the student representative from Maicai Middle School delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of the graduates. Finally, Tan Tiankai delivered the closing remarks, and the entire student body sang the graduation song together. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM. It is also learned that during the summer vacation, the primary and secondary schools in the First District will hold graduation examinations. Xu _, Huang _yin, and Situ Meilan, who achieved the best results, were each awarded a silver shield by Mayor Chen to show encouragement. At the same time, the first graduate of each school also received "Japanese Navy" one book.</p>
<p>Director Lin's speech briefly stated: Today is the second time we are holding the joint graduation ceremony of municipal schools after the recovery of the concessions. A total of seven middle schools and ninety-nine students, and nine primary schools and five hundred and eleven students participated. In the past, education often worshiped Europeanization. In the future, we must重 (zhòng - value) our own country and enhance the national spirit, and work hard with great courage. The teachers of municipal schools are excellent, and the students are excellent. We will surely be able to become门 (mén - a type of scholar) of the new China and revitalize China.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's speech briefly stated: I would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about a few important issues. Everyone knows that the Chinese people are not stupid, but very smart. Compared to a foreigner, a Chinese person is very good, but compared to several foreigners, the Chinese people seem to be lacking. Now, people in general society say that civil servants and military police have no discipline, but are they not Chinese? Of course they are. They all come from society, schools, and families. They have also received education before. Why do they violate their education? The reason is that the organization is not strict and strong enough, and the usual national修 (xiū - cultivate) is not deep enough, so society has become so chaotic, and discipline has deteriorated. These are the current phenomena. We must not let the second generation continue like this. This responsibility lies with all the faculty and staff and all the younger siblings. The chairman handed over the affairs of the Military Commission to me. Seeing that the discipline of soldiers and officers is not good, they have been educated. Their discipline was very good when they were at school, but it became bad after they left school. This must be because the youth now are full of自由思想 (zì yóu sī xiǎng - free thinking). Once they leave school and come into contact with society, their shortcomings are exposed. A country must be strong, and a good army must start from the陆军小学 (lù jūn xiǎo xué - army primary school). This is my personal opinion, and I hope that parents, in addition to raising their own good children, also安 (ān - understand) how to raise a good citizen.</p>

<h3>Streetcar Workers in the Old No. 1 District Are Discussing a Solution</h3>
<p>The labor dispute involving streetcar workers in the old No. 1 district of this city had been satisfactorily resolved through labor-management negotiations, and work was scheduled to resume yesterday morning. However, due to unexpected changes, only lines 1 and 7 resumed normal operations yesterday, while all other lines remained out of service. It is now known that the company is continuing discussions with relevant authorities to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Rice Transportation to Shanghai Still Faces Obstacles in Various Places; Authorities Have Sent Telegrams Ordering Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Rice merchants in this city are facing restrictions on the transportation of rice from various provinces and cities. After receiving reports, the Rice Management Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request instructions. The Executive Yuan issued a general order to the Nanjing Special City and the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, instructing all counties and districts that the transportation of rice should not be restricted for those holding passports issued by the Rice Management Association, and that assistance should be provided to facilitate regulation. The association recently issued transportation permits for rice in quantities of five dou to ten shi, allowing citizens to freely transport rice to Shanghai from fifteen counties, including Suzhou, Songjiang, Wujiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiangyin, Jiashan, and Pinghu. The sample of all permit forms has been sent to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Security Office, Police Department, Blockade Management Headquarters, China Railway Company, Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company, and offices in various districts, instructing security teams, county police stations, inspection stations, train stations, and preparatory committees of industry associations in various regions to investigate and ensure that those holding the permit are given absolute convenience and not obstructed. However, it has been found that there are still cases of obstruction in places such as Wuxi, Jiaxing, and Jiashan, which is a blatant disregard for government orders and the people's food supply. After receiving the report, the authorities have sent telegrams to the relevant agencies to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. The rice quantity on the passports and permits issued by the Rice Management Committee is based on the production volume of each rice-producing area, taking into account local consumption, and only allowing transportation of the surplus, which does not affect the local food supply. Therefore, the authorities believe that the obstructions along the way are suspected of undermining the law. Once verified, the offenders will be punished according to the law in order to ensure the stability of the grain policy.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp, from the start of preparations, has been actively proceeding. The work service of the camp is limited to "rural labor", and the camp site must be located in the suburbs. Therefore, personnel have been sent to various places to survey, and the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp (near Huacao Town), more than twenty li from the city, is considered the most suitable. The camp's board of directors has submitted a request to the city government for allocation. The old site of the Zhongzheng Camp covers more than 300 mu, but was completely destroyed during the incident, with bricks and wood being dismantled. More than 100 mu suitable for planting have already been illegally cultivated. The rubble field that requires more effort is still abandoned, which is a pity. Therefore, it is very appropriate to allocate this place as the site of the labor camp. It is reported that the city government has ordered the Fourth District Office to investigate and reply to the original submission of the camp's board of directors, and it is bound to be allocated smoothly.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Collecting Sample Test Questions from Various Schools</h3>
<p>The seventh session of the newspaper's reader scholarship application has been selectively recommended by various schools, and the number of applications from each school is limited, so at least 90% of the applicants are indeed impoverished and excellent, and worthy of subsidy. However, because tuition fees will inevitably increase significantly in the next semester, based on the amount of donations received, it is feared that only 20% to 30% can be subsidized. Now, the only way is to make every effort to raise more donations so that more students can be helped, and the other is to prepare for a preliminary examination to ensure a fair selection. The office is now requesting sample test questions from various schools for reference. For all grades above the fourth grade of elementary school and various subjects in junior and senior high school, as well as test questions for general subjects (Chinese, English, Mathematics) in universities, we hope that schools will provide a copy and indicate the grade level. If possible, please add the percentage of correct answers per question to show its difficulty. The purpose of collecting these test questions is to ensure that the questions are appropriate for the level of each grade, and we believe that schools will support this. Please indicate "Test Questions" on the envelope and send it to the scholarship office of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Gold Speculators' Trial Postponed</h3>
<p>On February 10th and March 8th of this year, the First Police Station arrested eighteen gold trading speculators, including Tang Shiqing, Chen Zhonghan, Hui Huisheng, Wang Wenhai, Chen Zhinian, Shi Hong, Su Changshu, Xu Songyan, Song Yaohua, Zheng Yingquan, Yao Xingnong, Li Wenshu, Ji Ziqing, Xu Changnian, Zhang Liang, Jin Yibao, Bai Zongchun, and Pan Qiaosheng. They were transferred to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate and detained. After investigation, they were transferred to the local court for trial. Judge Fu once interrogated them, but because the trial could not be concluded, it was postponed. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued trial, but because it is still necessary to investigate whether gold is a major commodity under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and whether gold is one of the "five metals" that are major commodities, the defendants were brought to the court but not interrogated. The court then postponed the trial again.</p>

<h3>Central District Vehicle Traffic Sets Rules</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau of this city, in order to strengthen traffic order and maintain pedestrian safety, has specially formulated temporary rules for vehicle traffic and temporary penalty regulations for traffic police, which will be implemented from today. A reporter recently interviewed Lu Qi, the administrative director of the First Police Bureau, who said, "Due to the dense population in this city, the traffic situation has always been complex. Since the emergence of tricycles and the elimination of the original boundaries for the operation of public and private vehicles after the takeover of the concessions, the central area has become even more crowded with vehicles. The Police Bureau has been paying close attention from the beginning and has been rectifying and cracking down at any time under the principle of convenience for the public. However, the traffic order problem is becoming increasingly serious, especially in the roads in the central area. In general, drivers of eastern vehicles neglect traffic rules and drive arbitrarily, causing traffic order to be chaotic. In view of this situation, this bureau has to take effective countermeasures, and decided to stipulate temporary regulations for the operation of the Xuan Dynasty, prohibiting the operation and parking of two-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws (empty) on various roads in the central area, such as Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, West Road, and Ningxia Road; and prohibiting the parking of tricycles and rickshaws (empty) on Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, Jiangxi Road, and Henan Road, because tricycles and rickshaws (empty) are most likely to hinder the traffic order, and drivers of tricycles and rickshaws are also the least likely to pay attention to traffic rules. In addition, temporary penalty regulations for traffic violations have been stipulated, and specific penalties have been set for vehicles that block traffic and violate traffic rules, and the original fines will be doubled for those who violate other regulations, so that they will know what to be vigilant about. All the temporary regulations for the operation of vehicle traffic and the temporary penalty regulations for traffic police will be announced and implemented in the next few days, and the traffic police of each branch will strictly enforce them, and personnel will be dispatched at any time to strictly supervise the traffic-intensive services to ensure that the regulations are thoroughly implemented, but on the one hand, the cooperation of citizens is still needed. I went to "" last month to inspect the police administration, and the traffic situation in Tokyo is complicated, but there are no "" traffic police, and pedestrians and vehicles are proceeding in an orderly manner, with no "". This shows that the progress of the country and the popularization of people's education have been fully demonstrated in terms of traffic order."</p>
<h3>Traffic Regulations</h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau has specially formulated temporary traffic regulations in order to maintain traffic safety. The following is an excerpt: It is strictly forbidden for all tricycles (public or private) and rickshaws (public or private) empty to pass on the following designated trunk roads. Any such vehicles with passengers should turn into the nearest side road after passengers disembark on the following trunk roads, and should not turn around or linger. If the side road (such as the intersection of Nanjing Road and West Factory Road) is also one of the designated trunk roads, the empty car should turn into the nearest side road again, but this restriction does not apply to empty cars crossing trunk roads. First Trunk Road: Nanjing Road (the section from the Bund to West Factory Road), Second Trunk Road: Jing'an Temple Road (the section from West Factory Road to Huangpi Road), Third Trunk Road: Xizang Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Beijing Road), Fourth Trunk Road: Ningxia Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Yushan Road). It is absolutely forbidden to park any empty cars in the following designated sections: Fuzhou Road (the section from Sichuan Road to Xizang Road), Henan Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Suzhou Road), Jiangxi Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Beijing Road), Sichuan Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Xianzhou Road). (Note 1) The restrictions on Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road do not apply on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. (Note 2) Military and police vehicles are not subject to this restriction. (Note 3) During the period of implementation of the temporary traffic regulations, all "parking spaces" for tricycles and rickshaws stipulated on the above-mentioned trunk roads in the first and second items shall not apply.</p>

<h3>National Forum: The Erroneous Concept of Choosing a College</h3>
<p>— By Ling Huajian</p>
<p>— Dedicated to this year's high school graduates</p>
<p>Based on many years of schooling experience, I feel that the average high school graduate has a wrong concept of choosing a college. This concept and its consequences can be discussed in two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Most students who think they are naturally gifted, do not seek to improve themselves, and aim to obtain a diploma, choose colleges such as literature and commerce, because they can have easy courses and a leisurely life. As a result, after four years, a group of unlearned people, who pay attention to "style", American-style empty talk politicians, writing literary figures, hoarding bankers, etc. are created.</p>
<p>(2) Generally, thoughtful students, in view of the country's poverty and the backwardness of industry and scientists, many choose colleges such as engineering and physics, with the intention of serving the country in the future. As a result, many have lung diseases, and many have become bookworms who do not know the outside world, and still have little benefit to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also good students in each college who truly understand the true meaning of learning; however, we must correct the mistakes of most students, because there is no doubt about the prosperity and strength of a country; however, the development of industry and science cannot be achieved without a political and economic environment that is on the right track. From this point of view, the responsibility of politics and economics is more important than that of students in engineering and science, and now these two colleges are full of muddled people. How can they be asked to take the fundamental responsibility of improving the national environment? At the same time, a group of promising young people are sacrificing their lives by studying hard. How can we expect the country to become prosperous and strong in the future? The remedy can also be discussed in two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Improve the standards of literature and business colleges and implement strict moral and physical training, so that confused and lazy people cannot mix in them and harm the society and the country in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Engineering and science colleges may as well tend to utilitarianism, focusing on practical science, and within the possible scope, they may as well slightly ignore the overly profound pure science theory, so that students can have time to engage in activities that enhance their physical fitness.</p>
<p>This is just a general idea. A detailed improvement plan still needs to be formulated by educators. If improved according to this method, the wealth of the country and the strength of the nation can be achieved soon. (Moved to help school)</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Naval Painter (7)</p>
<p>Takafusa took a small sip of the beer that was brought over, and Kanjito also had a glass, so a thin layer of red hung on his face, and happily put down his fork and said:</p>
<p>"I knew you came to Tokyo to be a painter, to be honest..."</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>Takafusa unconsciously spoke a dialectal phrase. Kanjito also said in his native dialect:</p>
<p>"Not long ago, the warship Isuzu came to visit, and that's how I found out you were in Tokyo. It just so happens that you've changed your appearance, and you've grown your hair long, so even if I ran into you, I might not have dared to recognize you."</p>
<p>The two of them later began to speak standard Mandarin.</p>
<p>"Then did my father tell you about my purpose in studying art?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I heard. He said you wanted to be a marine painter. You liked the sea when you were little, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to be a marine painter anymore. I want to be a naval painter."</p>
<p>"You want to be a naval painter?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I want to depict the spirit and beauty of the navy. I paint warships, and I paint naval battles.... At the same time, I also paint soldiers.... Some people say that's advertising art, and I really don't understand."</p>
<p>Takafusa wiped the beer foam off his lips, still upset about what he had just said, but Kanjito didn't understand.</p>
<p>"But your father said that people hate the navy and that's why you became a painter..."</p>
<p>"Let's not talk about that! I'm a little embarrassed."</p>
<p>Takafusa pushed his long hair up to the top of his head and said, "Once a man makes up his mind, it's not easy to change it again. Although I've made up my mind, my reason doesn't agree with me. Maybe I'm still an immature person. Now that I can't be a naval officer, I want to be a naval painter. Once I made this decision, it was as if a hundred-year dream had awakened. From now on, I plan to study the navy for the rest of my life, so Kanjito, please help me!"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I can't help. As long as I can help, I'll do anything. But now it's good, there was a time when I was very worried about you, and I couldn't even sleep at night."</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry. Kanjito, although I extremely admire you, I didn't want to write to you."</p>
<p>"But how is your health?"</p>
<p>"It's strange to say, although I failed the naval academy and naval radar and other schools, and even failed the conscription, I haven't been sick once since I came to Tokyo. My body may not be suitable for a soldier, but it's always okay for a painter."</p>
<p>Takafusa said this, and Kanjito responded with a hearty laugh. And unconsciously, they returned to the way they were five years ago, talking freely and openly. (106)</p>

<h3>Let's Talk About How to Eat Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Adzuki beans, soybeans, buckwheat, barley, corn, etc. are all miscellaneous grains that can fill the stomach. Eating them is also very nutritious for the body. Adzuki beans and soybeans can be mixed with rice after they have plumped up (immersed in water for a day or a night), when cooking rice or porridge, about a pound can offset the amount of half a liter of white rice.</p>
<p>Barley and buckwheat can be cooked and eaten alone. There are several ways to eat them: (1) Grind them into fine powder, stir-fry them, and mix them with boiling water. (2) Grind them into wheat grits, bring the water to a boil, and then pour the wheat grits down to cook them (about a bowl of water can be mixed with five spoons of wheat grits). (3) Grind the wheat into small pieces, which can be cooked with rice, and it is very sticky.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of corn flour: fine powder and crushed grains. Crushed grains can be cooked with porridge and rice. Fine powder can be mixed with a small amount of flour and "baking soda" to make cakes, or it can be stir-fried, spooned into the mouth, and washed down with some boiling water. It can also be mixed evenly with cold water, poured into a pot, and cooked with vegetables to become corn paste, which is also very filling. If corn flour is used to cook porridge and rice, one pound can offset the amount of seven hectoliters of white rice. (Hu Changxin)</p>
<h3>Practical Training at the School of Documents and Correspondence: Drafting Official Documents</h3>

<p>Guiqin Scholarship: The private Huai'en Middle and Primary School has established the "Guiqin Scholarship" in memory of its late headmistress, Ms. Jin Guiqin, offering twenty scholarships (limited to senior high, junior high, and senior primary school students), with full tuition waivers. Furthermore, to support impoverished students, an additional twenty half-fee scholarships are available. Students from genuinely impoverished families with excellent character and academics can apply to the school's admissions committee. Those who pass the entrance examination (the first one scheduled for July 8th) and review will be eligible for one of the above two types of assistance.</p>
<p>Girls' Voluntary Night School Enrollment</p>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA is organizing a girls' voluntary night school, with summer classes starting on July 3rd and the autumn semester commencing on September 1st. Those from impoverished families who are motivated to enroll can directly request the regulations from the association at 638 Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<p>Guidance Lecture for Further Education: The Chinese Christian Association organizes guidance lectures for further education every year to assist high school graduates in pursuing higher education. The lectures for this year will be held from Monday (the 26th) of next week until the end of the week, from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily, in the main hall of the association at Eight Immortals Bridge. Students from various universities will introduce the internal situations of each school on a daily basis. High school graduates are welcome to attend the lectures.</p>
