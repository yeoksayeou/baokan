<h3>社評　中日合作的新詮釋</h3>
<p>最近一年間，我們經常介紹盟邦日本朝野的言論，特別對於有關中日問　的言論，不厭求詳，盡量揭載。同時，就我們的所見，加以問釋，加以申引。我們爲什麼這樣做呢？囚爲我們的理想，是建設新中國，是中日合作，是大東亞共存共榮。實現這些理想，最主要的就是中日朝野之間，眞正能夠相互瞭解，基於相互瞭解以後的協力方案，才不致隔靴搔癢，才能收獲切實的成效。盟邦朝野的言論，表示盟邦朝野對於中國的期望與見解，同時反映盟邦對於中國的瞭解如何，更可以窺知中日協力的成效如何。我們所以盡量介紹日本朝野言論的意思，就在於此。</p>
<p>今天本報轉譯朝日新聞的社評「强化中日協力」一文，（見第二版），咋天本報揭載日駐華派遣軍總司令部辻政信大佐演講詞「告日本僑胞一，我們略加分析如次：</p>
<p>辻大佐說：「大東亞戰爭現已進入決戰階段，在此戰爭之中途上，日本曾表明對華新方針，認爲唯有與中國携手並進，始有日本之存在，同時唯有循此途徑，始能與戰爭之大目的相符合。……日本在中國之百萬軍官民，若各人能與對百萬之中國同志認爲眞正同志，則事變可謂已早能獲得解決。……大東亞戰爭之解決，乃繁於中日事變之處理上，同時上海十萬日僑均持有解決事變之關鍵。」辻大佐重視中日協力對於大東亞戰爭的密切關係，而期待日本在華百萬軍民對中國同志認爲眞正同志，以爲解決事變的關鍵。這種見解，我們認爲非常正確而熱切，我們向所主張中日之間，不僅需要官方的合作，同時，更需要官民四方面的合作，不僅認爲同志，尤須視中國的民生問題就是日本的民生問題，而且爲中日合作的先決問題，凡足以改善中國民生疾苦者，竭力協助之。質直而言，日本在華官民對中國的民生問題，必須有「人飢己飢，人溺己溺」之心，更從而協助改善。辻大佐又引述奉日軍司令官之命，祭祀蔣母之墓，證明道義的好意。並謂「吾人如以赤誠之心對待他人，決不致無人跟隨吾人」。不過，我們願意獻言於辻大佐以及日本朝野者，日本人士如果對中國人士的祖墓表示尊敬，則足以增進彼此之間的情感者，固無可疑。不過，尊敬祖墓，僅僅是方法之一端，必須從而擴展至全面的相互問尊敬，意義才廣大。同時，我們認爲中國老百姓都有老母，每個中國老百姓都有祖墓，如能以尊敬蔣母之好意，同樣的普遍及於老百姓之老母，才能與中國老百姓全面發生情感作用。這樣使用道義的好意，才能普遍播種於中國老百姓的心頭·以這樣赤誠之心對待中國老百姓，那末，中國老百姓的跟隨，自然無問題了。所以，我們再四主張，日本協力中國，强化中國，必須以中國老百姓爲對象，則協力與强化，可收事半功倍之效。如僅僅以中國政府或少數人爲對象，則協力與强化，必致事倍而功半。願日本朝野諸君午，於實施對華方策時，把握這一主要關鍵。</p>
<p>日本朝日新聞論「强化中日協力」，所見要點，很多與我們向來主張相同。我們在去年十二月八日大東亞戰爭兩周年之日，社評中以「大東亞戰爭與中國興亡」爲題，曾說：「目前我們中國同胞必須認淸者，就是大東亞宜言五大原則之實現，與完成大東亞戰爭有不可分離之述帶關係。亦即如何爭取戰爭勝利，乃爲第一條件，一切目標，均須集中於此。更應認淸東亞興亡與中國興亡，實其一而二，二而一之關係。東亞興亡，固在此一戰，即中國興亡，亦在此一戰，」今朝日社論中說：「保持中國的獨立，中日條約的實現，不能不求之於大東亞戰爭的勝利中。東亞的興亡與中國的興亡，是一而二，二而一的。」所論若合符節。朝日社論中又說：汪主席提出肅正思想，確保治安，增强生產三項，爲進一步强化國府政治力的舉措。尤以增產爲中國經濟的復興建設，乃確保中國獨立的基礎，是以日本爲尊重國府經濟的自主，實施種種協力。可是，我們認爲汪主席提出的三點固均重要，然而達到這三項口的，還有一個先決的前提，就是「政治革新」。而政治革新應從改善民生入手。因此，我們主張從速建立民意機關，使人民對於改善生活的意見，得以上達，得以實現。</p>
<h3>日軍渡過馬猶河　西南擴大戰果　吉大港海岸敵運輸船炸沉</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日下午五時發表，印緬邊境布其頓孟多方面戰况如次：　日軍於頓古巴扎附近渡過馬猶河後，刻向該陣西岸地區南進中，與由布其頓正面突破敵陣北進部隊互相呼應，正圍攻馬猶山脈以東敵軍主力。　日軍有力部隊已由頓古巴扎攀登馬猶山脈繼續挺進，於二月六日炸毀那基安央地方橋樑，將該地附近確保，而切斷孟多方而敵軍之退路。　日軍航空隊連日出動，緊密協力該方地上部隊作戰。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據緬甸日軍前綫某基地十日電，英印軍第七師及第五師，企岡在布其頓及日溪正面實行反攻，但遭日軍之先發總攻後，即向孟多方面敗退，重演其「阿拉坎悲劇」，連日又遭日陸軍機隊尾追轟炸，故更形混亂。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電印度洋前綫某基地電，日海軍航空部隊，於九日拂曉在吉大港海岸發見敵八千噸級之運輪船，常即加以轟炸，卒將其炸沉，是役日軍無損失。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據印度洋前綫日軍某基地電，日本海軍機隊，八日黎明，曾猛炸錫蘭島巴的卡羅亞北方十哩之卡爾克達敵軍設施，投彈均命中目標，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>海上戰現勢檢討反軸心難有作為日期軍先發制人予英打擊</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　駐緬之日軍與印度國民軍携手，於馬猶山系之峻險地帶已展開勇猛之攻擊戰，刻正節節制壓英印軍之命脈。該方面之戰况，進展極爲順利，日軍精說神速獲得戰果之事實，敵方亦已承認，敵於五日發表之戰况公報中稱：日軍曾奇襲布其頓前面馬猶河畔要衡頓古巴札，將該地佔領，刻正向該地西南方擴大戰果中。日軍此次先發制人之攻擊，已予集結緬印邊境待機中之英印軍以莫大打擊，此已不難想像敵之對緬甸及日軍南洋佔領地之反攻。自蒙特巴頓就任以來，敵我均認作戰將以海上爲主，今由於日軍先發制人之作戰，彼等自陸上之反攻企圖，巳遭挫折，然敵反攻主流之海上作戰，又將如何，今試就蒙時巴頓所謂之海上反攻現勢加以檢討如下；英之著名軍事評諭家伏爾斯曾嘆稱：印度緬甸方面戰　綫，與太平洋戰綫逈異，蒙特巴頓之反攻，必須橫斷孟加拉灣，且於此戰綫苜先必須遭遇强力日軍陸上兵力之攻擊。緬甸泰國方面之日軍，曾積極改善道路，幷已能迅速移動兵力，此即爲吾等侵攻作戰必須加入能與强力日本軍相敵之兵力之意，亦即謂戰爭之最初亦必須展開大規模一有通絡之登陸作戰，此種登陸作戰，現在之蒙特巴頓果否可能耶，蓋使日軍屈服絕非易事，想反軸心之最後大攻勢，將必須延至能以出動較現在極度優秀兵力之時，此殆爲敵軍於東南亞州反攻之作戰觀，然敵軍作戰上尙存有下幾種基本困難，　歐洲第二戰綫問題，因最近歐洲　局之推移形勢益關緊要，故反軸心軍應　之有所準備。　掩護登陸部隊之飛機，以及登陸用船舶等戰備不充分。　印　洋海岸日軍佔領地及安達曼尼科巴島等地之日軍防禦陣極爲嚴密　印度洋之制空，制海權問題。反觀今後日軍則有自由印度國民軍協力，且印度國民軍此種開始向德里進攻之事實　予印度國內情緒莫大反響預想印度事情將愈行險惡，凡此種種殆即消滅敵反攻决意之根源。總之，敵軍由海上反攻，有種種　難，恐不易即刻有所作爲，但去年雨季過後，敵軍即在印緬國境作　種努力，積極補充海上反攻戰備，在加爾各答。錫闌島。享可馬里等地　續調集習於熟帶戰之北非民軍。同時英國地中海艦隊之一部，亦調至印度洋，在孟加拉沿岸大規模之登陸演習，在吉大港，錫蘭島積集大批軍需，由此可知敵軍在陸上正而失敗之後，爲保存其而顏，而在海上展開反攻，實存心已久矣。</p>
<h3>印度獨立運動　達最後階段　鮑斯在前綫答記者問</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電緬甸某地訊，自由印度國民軍，自在阿拉坎戰錢活躍以來，將兵之士氣益見昂揚，鮑斯總帥爲力謀完成印度人多年之希望，親在緬印國境附近指揮。記者為叩詢實情，特於九日謁見鮑斯總帥於某某本部，藉悉總帥完成祖國獨立之决意及國民軍之鬥志，蓋國民軍自開始進擊以來，總帥雖在軍事紛忙中，猶不斷訓示將兵，予以激勵。記者於覲見總帥時，總帥正在披閱地岡，作詳細之研究，總帥身御軍服，威容嚴肅，一面應對記者，一面凝視地圍，充滿愛祖國之精神，故飽斯氏在精神上實予身處於英國桎梏下之印人及從事進擊德里之印國民軍以極大感動。鮑斯氏對記者表明其確信謂：吾人必能完成吾人之獨立，乃無疑之事實，又復與記者問答如次：問，自由印度臨時政府遷往緬甸後之感慨如何？答，余在昭南時，曾擬在精神上，物質上總動員僑居東亞之三百萬印人，集中其力量，以期驅逐英國勢力，此實為準備之過程，至緬甸以後，余之　情已為祖國之將來所吸引，作之視綫即集中於阿拉坎地區，藍余過去之時間，完全　於在東亞集結國民軍之上，　余已站在東亞之最前綫，開始正式活動。問，國民軍開始進擊從之感想如何？答，吾人之獨立遝動，已進至最後階段，今後所應努力者，僅為繼續　擊，直至佔領德里之日爲止。</p>
<h3>印議會接受　控吿政府案</h3>
<p>阿姆斯達丹十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，新德里息，英印政府已於本期議會開會以來遭遇第一次之失敗，議會已接得提案一件，控政府二點，一，誤用印省保護法，二，拘捕政治犯案中被吿之代辯人，印中央議會以四十三票對四十一票通過接受該項提案。印議會派黨負回敎大同盟國家主義派及獨立派之議員，均一致贊成該項提案。</p>
<h3>襲拉巴爾敵機　擊落百餘架　日大本營昨發表戰果</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營十日下午四時發表：帝國海軍航空隊及陸海軍守備部隊，二月六日以來連日邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機，二月六日擎落來襲敵機約百六十架中之二十七架（內十四架未證實），我機三架未歸還。七日擊落來襲敵機約二百架中之四十五架（內十五架不證實），我機一架朱歸還。九日擊落來襲敵機約二百二十架中之四十五架（內十一架未證實），我機五架未歸返。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地電，九日曾有敵中型轟炸機二架來襲波根維爾島南方之巴拉雷島，當地日海軍守備隊即邀擊之，擊毀其二架，日方無損失。</p>

<p>譯論</p>
<h3>強化中日協力</h3>
<p>此次日本議會中，很明確的闡明日本對申國的固定方針。靑木大東亞大臣在衆議院預算總會上設明中日同盟條約的精神。自從國民政府參戰，中日提携向擊滅英美之途邁進以後，兩國關係顯示了劃時期的進展·尤以國民政府自强政策的結果，日本更毫無顧慮的與中國締結同盟條約。兩國關係的基礎，在英美勢力業已被逐，攪亂中日關係的禍根剷除之後，當然建立在互相信賴與協力上面，權益觀念與對立觀念完全一掃而空。日本對華政策，正沿此方針推進中。</p>
<p>關於這種對華政策的方向，在一月三十一日的衆議院修正華北開發，華中振與兩公司法委員會上明白宣稱，日本對華新政策擬由中國方面的創意與努力以整備開發態勢，如將來情形許可，兩公司亦將根據新政策的理念，予以調整。</p>
<p>由於日本質施對華新政策，中日關係踏上正軌。但雖上正軌而仍不前進，懈意了此後的努力，則勢將前功盡棄·要使之向共同目標邁進，中日朝野應更集中努力於兩國的諒解與强化協力。日本方面固然在培養中國的創意（譯者按，即自主之意）與力量，但同時中國方面亦須嚴予警戒，勿對日方過於强調自主性，致背追而馳。</p>
<p>中國協力完遂戰爭的方式，汪主席提出肅正思想，確保治安，增强生產三項。此均爲更進一步强化國府政治力的舉揹。尤以增强生產，中國經濟的復興建設，乃確保中國獨立的基礎。是以日本尊重國府之經濟的自主，爲帮助其自强建設，實施移交物資移動取締權，收買配給物資之中日平等性，移交新敵產並軍管理工廠等，期待中國方面根據其創意與責任而積極活動。</p>
<p>鑒於戰局現階段的要求，中日經濟提携當然應集中於增强戰力這一點。見其增强生產，不能不以中國協力完遂大東亞戰爭為自標。中國方面對於日本戰力的帮助，尤以華北軍需物資的貢獻爲最鉅。但其他區域，尤以華中的經濟復與，生產增强的現况，不能說滿意。現在中國大陸物價的品騰，不僅釀成威脅民生問題的可憂事態，其結果，使民族資本從事囤積商品，而生產則繼續陷於停滯過程。此種事態，不消說；妨碍中國戰時經濟建設，阻害增强戰力，絕對不能任其自然發展。但因積漸由來，複雜繁瑣，故其對策亦頗困難。可是，無論如何，必須設法解决。有中日兩國沒有走錯共榮的大道，充滿着完成共同目的的熱忱，兩國眞能打成一片，施行急要施策，我們相信這决不是不可能的。</p>
<p>保持中國的獨立，中日條約的實現，不能不求之於大東亞戰爭的勝利中。東亞的與亡與中國的興亡是一而二，二而一的。我們希望中國國民充分了解中日的命　實繁於大東亞戰爭的勝敗，與大東亞十億民族携手擊滅敵人，戰至獲得最後勝利之日爲止。（翔：譯自二月三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>米統會促進收買　實施貨物交換　堅持一貫方策收買米價無變更</h3>
<p>最近外傳米糧統制委員會，對於下層機構，有所更張，同時對於收買價格，亦須變更，並將修正米穀運銷管理條例。上海社記者昨往訪米統會袁主任委員，叩以究竟，蒙發表書面談話如下：本會　常與各關係機關不斷聯絡或開會，純係有感本身責任之艱鉅，為工作上之研究，以期採運儲配四項工作，臻於順利，俾軍　民食，兩有所賴，但仍堅持一貫方策，努力進行，未嘗考慮其他改弦更張之事。</p>
<p>加強採辦委會組織</p>
<p>本會對於下層機構問題，當時指定米糧採辦籌備委員會之際，審查各　備委員之收買能力。自實施採購以來，凡力有不逮，或所訂數量，繳納不足者，均經先後淘汰，撤銷其籌備資格，而留成績優良之等委，在最短時期內，正式　組公會，俾成為永久之米糧採購機構，專營今後並來年度之採購任務。現有之籌委，自應體察自身使命之重大與責任，力求完成其使命。至現有籌委之成績不良者，仍將預予以督飭，甚或撤銷其資格。如果發現對於本會及其他方面有損害之處，當予以適當之制裁與處分</p>
<p>收買價格並無變更</p>
<p>關於收買價格問題，前經本會審慎考慮、呈奉公佈施行，但緣一部份不良商人，暗中仍以高價交易，以致引起外間種種臆測，胥非事實，本會現仍堅持既定方針，並無變更，蓋常本會决定收買價格標準之際，對於現　之環境與將來之物價趨勢，均經縝密之研討，目下實無變更之理由也。　關於米糧搬運辦法，今後仍當嚴格執行，對於故違功令者，自應由主管機關從嚴取締。</p>
<p>物物交換促進收買</p>
<p>袁氏並謂，近以農民生活必需品，日益高昂，深感痛苦，故本會對於出售米糧之農民，將以棉布·火柴·洋燭·肥皂等按照合理的代價，作為交換物資，俾促收買工作之圓滑，不日即可實施，惟交換時間定有限度，出　觀望而致遲誤者，其配給量亦漸減少，或竟截止。</p>
<p>黑市交易從嚴取締</p>
<p>再則米糧黑巾交易，並另擬嚴重取維，至於籌備委員中，如向農民購得米糧，不導功令逕售於本會，而潛行搬遝圖利或希圖囤積者，罪大惡極，實為糧政之靈，一經發覺，自應從嚴懲罰。總之，本會自上年冬季忽遽成立，百端草創，自非絕無道憾事，今正逐漸求其強化，幸賴中日雙方當局予以種種之協力，並強化取締辦法，對於達成使命，未敢懈怠，區區微忱，尚望各界諒察而協助之，豈僅　登之幸而已也。</p>
<h3>六十二期米粉　明日起發售　白米二升二號粉一斤</h3>

<h3>市宣傳處明日　招待兩部長</h3>
<p>市宣傳處為歡送日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長榮　，及歡迎新任松平情報部長膜新起見。特聯合本市各宣傳有關機關，定明（十二）日下午三時假座國際飯店十四樓，舉行盛大招待茶會，屆時將有一番盛况。</p>
<h3>南市配給品　散發購買證</h3>
<p>南市肥皂火柴煤球等計口授給，所有各該物品之購買證，連日正由市保甲委會及七區保甲辦事處，暨保甲消費合作社，派員在各該聯保處分別監視散發，但卒因人數眾多，致未能如限完竣，各坊將依次散發之原定日期，予以變更，一俟一坊散發完竣後，即行散　二坊，依次類推，直至普遍散發完竣。</p>
<h3>松平情報部長　首次接見記者　談租界接收後政治變遷</h3>
<p>中央社訊日本大使館上海事務所　田情報部長，昨（十）日午後三時在華愁飯店入樓，舉行定例報道常　席上，面本市中國新開記者團介紹新任大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，首由廣田情報部長致詞介紹，略調：「松平書記官，此次由京來滬，綱任大使館上海事務所情報部長，深盼本市輿論界諸位，能如前多多賜予協助，松平　記官居華十餘年，今後對各位之連絡，自當更形密切」云云。福由松平都長，談務交租界後政治上的變　，並希望上海言說界協力完成任務，茲　談話內客如次</p>
<p>望與論界共同協力</p>
<p>余此次調任上海大使館事務所專管報道關係事務，决意本過去誠意與信念，與各方面接觸，祇談率直公論，不尚處言，關於此點，希望中國方面輿論界予以諒解，並賜協力。</p>
<p>上海為中國經濟中心地，亦為文化中樞，由來在上海之中國人，其　面如何，為决定中國侖運之一大要素，因之英變始終堅持上海之中立性，以中國政治上　些微之缺陷，面租界居民作誇大惡意宜傳，使中國人自然的喪失對中國政治之信仰，結果在租界之中國人，對中國政治站於批評的立塲，迨至去年七月三十日租界收回，政治上發生空前大變革。</p>
<p>拭除英美思想殘渣</p>
<p>然百年來受英美政策遣毒之思想，至今尚未能滌淸，言論機關是人民公器，故輿論界負有重大使命，不專為本身利益着想，應為國家社會，為大東亞，作為社會之木鐸，率先担任思想戰士，拭除英美思想之殘渣，使上海回復為中國的，東亞的上海</p>
<p>今日職爭已進入决　階段，敵人乘日木利用南方　地　一切所有充實戰力之前，織織實行投機性的作；以企圖挽回不能開闢歐洲第二　綫及無力實行緬旬反攻作戰之名譽損失，但此次戰爭為保全亞洲自主獨立之　爭，求亞洲生存自衛之戰爭，决定亞洲命運之戰爭·歷三百年來呻吟於英美橫　下之亞洲·今日已回復名　之獨立自由，更負起重任，援助印度等回復其獨立自主，吾人深信如不斷努力，必有達到目的之一日，希望上海輿論界協力完成此種任務。</p>
<h3>第二次防空日　演習成績甚佳　燈火管制更有進展</h3>
<p>中央社訊上海特別市市民防空本部為啓發民眾防空智識，規定每月九日為「防空日」，前（九）日為市二次防空日，全市各區分別舉行救火救護遮彈等各項防空演習，當晚實施燈火管制，中央社記者昨特走訪該部負責人披談：「此次各區舉行之防空演習，路過行人均予參加，成績甚佳，對燈火管制之演習，更見劇烈進展，僅第八區於初時尚有少數居戶燈光洩外後，經警告後，即予改善，務望市民嗣後更須密切注意，以防萬一不幸事件之發生，而維全市市民生命財產之安全」。</p>
<p>遮彈服裝應予糾正　　繼云，惟民衆聞得炸彈下降時，應雙手掩住限耳，而平伏於地，然於演習時民眾往往雙手撑地，身體埢伏作弓形狀，未免失當，蓋一旦發生事件，其勢必耳膜震聾上變眼疊出，甚或中彈片受傷，頗為危險，又此次實施普遍演習時，民眾十九長袍外套，則對各項措置有所不便，及有若干女子穿着短褲，雖穿有絲　，但其　肉易受創傷，故對以上二點，市民應予糾正，從速改善。</p>
<h3>日電影明星　坂東妻三郎抵滬</h3>
<p>中日兩國電影界，於三年前曾决定合作攝製「春江遺恨二片，該影片之故事為太平天國時之歷史事實，日本曾派著名劇作家二人來滬搜集有關之史料，經年餘始告竣事，由中華電影聯合公司與大日本映畫社合作攝製，由中日兩國第一流導演及明星首次聯合協力參加。現日本著名第一流男明星坂東妻三郎及大日本映實社製作局長曾我正史，已於昨日下午大時許，由東京抵滬，當即於寓所招待本市各報社記者，由製作局長曾我正史發表攝製該片之意旨，為促進中日文化交流，及喚起東亞民族之十萬萬人民對擊滅英美之意識而自求解放云。</p>

<h3>三輪車夫勒索　決嚴格取締</h3>
<p>中央社訊本市三輸車擅增軍價，業經公用局傳集各公司負責人　加詰責，當由該業公登報自承不合，一面以迫於成本日高，仍請當局曲予體諒，業經該局轉呈市政府核準酌予調整，惟為維　市場民利前輪起見，對於車夫額外勒索，決心嚴格取締。茲將現行三輪車重資價目表錄後，（酒資包含在內）雙人車，每三十分　起碼三十元，每加五分鐘增加五元，單人車每三十分鐘起碼二十元。每加五分鑛增加三元。</p>
<h3>利用黃金作投機　當局實行檢舉　為安定民生有取締必要</h3>
<p>中央社訊近日金價飛漲，致使其他物價日益暴騰，引起當局之注意，特於昨日上午派出幹探多名，分赴從事金條賣買塲所，實行檢舉。中央社記者為此往謁有關當局，探詢究竟，據答：「近來黃金交易，往往越出常軌，蓋過去當局，為顧及市民製造必需飾物之用，准許銀樓飾金等店復業，原期從事此業者，能　寸法令，應付實際需要，不作投機賣買，及囤積之圖。不料近來一輩投機奸商，竟藐視法令，異想天開，重又利用黃金，作為投機及囤積之目標，恣意操縱，影響所及，實足擾亂金融，牽動物價，民生更受其困。為安定民生計，實有繼續檢舉取締之必要」云云。</p>

<h3>評言　超越限價</h3>
<p>農歷新年以前，上海物價即巳開始作驚人的上漲：農　新年以後，物價上漲之風，益呈狂風怒號之勢，漲風所播，簡直令人感覺草木皆兵，而　水階級與家庭主婦，尤覺日坐愁城中，瞠目不知生活何以為繼。這種現象，恐怕是戰時各國都市中所罕有的，因為，自有戰事以來，物價上漲，雖為各國共同的現象，然其上漲的程度與速率，絕未有如今日的上海物價；今日漲一倍，明日則二倍，以至五倍，十倍，而千百倍；甚且一日之間，下午的物價，高過上午，一路之上，此店的物價，超過彼店，　從口出，漫無標準，問時，漲者自漲，購者態購，因此造成愈漲愈購，愈購愈漲的形態，而物價水準，與平民生活，遂同遭萬却不復的厄運。</p>
<p>昨聞本市警察當局，為切實取締各業之超越限價起見，決即從嚴取締，不稍寬貸；同時，政府已通令各公會商號，關於此後加價事項，應呈由物價評議委員會審核，而經濟局業已奉准成立物價評議委員會，從此中央市塲不再執行評價了。在平衡物價的對策中，公定價格與取締暴利，原不過是治標的方法，可是在今日嚴重的物價情態下，不先治標，又將如何？那木，今後的物價責任，就有全權付諸經濟與警察兩局的必要，否則，上海物價問題，真的不可收拾了。</p>
<h3>嚴管各業買賣　當局商有對策　製造商不得售給囤戶</h3>
<p>晚近本市物價漲風益趨暴烈，同時各業市塲買賣亦起伏不定，然一般中下階級市民顯已遭受嚴重威脅，記者昨向各方面探悉，本」巾各主管當局，為謀澈底抑平物價，持久穩定工商業起見，近日以來，迭經召開會議，磋商妥善有效辦法，今當局對抑平物價已商有新對策，即將分別致函各業公會，轉飭會員同業一體導行，並授權各該公會負責監管同業買賣，如有違反情事，即須具報當局，聽憑法律制裁，倘任何公司商號，無論其營業性質如何，如有不導照下列各項辦法買賣者，一律按照上述手績辦理。</p>
<p>襲造廠不得拒絕將製成品供給正當商號，而該商號獲得此項物資，應即照限出售。　廠方不得將製成品大量批給非業中人。　廠商如有適當原料，應照常生產。　商號如因現貨無着，不得向黑市扒吸，以黑市價格售貨，以免魚目混珠，擾亂市况，同時使囤戶不易將囤貨出籠。　商號出售貨物，不論多寡，必須列入帳冊，書明年月日及價格數量，以供當局人員隨時查閱。　堆存　房丙貨物，不得擅自移動。　任何貨物持單人應由各該公　查明，具報常局，以憑處理。　倘各廠巳將棧單殺出，歷時已久者，應即促其出貨，否則可向　局　告，以國積論罪。</p>
<h3>證交監理會　討論新股票</h3>
<p>新春開市後，未經當局核准之二十七種新股票，擅自上市開拍，此事因有違背政府取締投機事業之法令，故引起社會各界之重視，上海交易所監理委員會有監於此，并奉財實兩部之電令，於日前明令華商證券交易所尅即將未經核准之股票暫停上市，聽候核定，記者頃悉交易所監理委員會，定今（十一）日開會，討論取締未合法新股票上市問題，及今後應採取之有效措置。</p>
<h3>煤渣同業　組織公會</h3>
<p>本市煤渣號業領袖，為謀便利同　移運，及造福民間起見，特發起組設「上海特別市煤渣號業同業公會」，藉克解除同業倒懸，及持久安定市况，抑平煤渣市價，現該會業經呈請市經濟局核准，發給許可證書，一面辦理同業入會登記，截至昨日止，加入該會寫會員者，已有一百餘家。</p>
<h3>防止不法囤積　蔴類加緊統制</h3>
<p>昨據記者自關係方面探悉，常局為防止不法商人隱囤蔴類起見，對於蔴類之統制工作，决加緊進行，所有蔴商，非經當局授權，絕對禁止收買蔴類，　法商人，一經查出，以國積主要物資罪名依法追究，又關於蔴類移動，由當局劃分區域辦理，各區內可自由移動，移出或移入一區，則須經當局許可。</p>
<h3>華股起伏靡定　榮豐紗廠獨見挺升</h3>
<p>昨華股起伏隘狹，除有特殊情形一部份堅挺外，餘多告平疲，投資目標轉移後尚未歸來，各方人心閑散；文化業的務書館之賣價竟喊高至六千元外，中華書局與中影等疲軟，華倫造紙挺秀，百貨業　安開設總店訊獨升一元，光華與三公司均平疲；紡織業榮豐一哄五元，叩九十元　，大通，圓圓，大統，仁豐，大光明等堅定，永安紗廠與美亞盤平，中紡等均見低落；新華股中西獨挺，中法等盤小；化工股最平，保安玻璃升五角；公用股亦平；投資業利亞與大中華實業，新亞建業堅挺，久安等實業均平；南洋烟公司，康元製繼等路低。今誌晚收價於後：</p>

<h3>四號學生（八）　海軍  岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</h3>
<p>在白　的參考館前，櫻花盛開的時候，眞人的四號生活，也來得熟練一點兒了。行禮的方法，高揚着手整着脚歩行路，十三時是午後一時，裝書的篷布書包呌Bag，Shirt就是襯衣，Pocket就是衣袋—同時並不是藏手的地方，也漸漸地明白了。</p>
<p>只是，早晟五時半，總員起床的喇叭聲，雖還在困倦着，而嚇得胸口突突地跳着。常有人感佩那睡車上的侍擈們收拾臥具的迅速，但是在兵學校裏，要只費那一半的時間，而整頓着比那加倍的美觀。這不但是眞人，同時是全體的新四號的苦惱。疊起夾的毛氈，有皺紋，或者不挺直地也是不行的。必須要同隣接着的床上的毛氈　成一直綫的。更數扭地就是疊折的地方有三條綫露着。一見就可以　是整齊與否。並且若是遲疑一點兒，連洗險和上厕所的時問都沒有。從整床到整列，一共不過十五分鐘的工夫。若是稍微一躱懶，就要起江田島地震，値班的上級生，要將毛氈全體都揚翩了的。結局還得自已去整理。　人已經認為這只有熟練，以外沒有辦法，所以整床的時候，格外的細心。因爲過於緩慢，同期生也要笑他的，到洗臉所去一看，巳經沒有立錐之地了。那洗臉的方法也不同，爲預防傳染病，不使用洗臉盆，用流着的自來水，嗽口，洗臉凉水澡。在洗臉所巳經用了全幅的時間，不知有多少回，到厕所去，也要節約了的。幸而「地震」可以避免過去了。</p>
<p>整頓和敏捷—這是眞人感到的兩個最大的行動原理。他被分派在菊花紋章煇耀着的新學生館，他聽到那窗的開法，隨着夏天，酷暑，冬天，該寒都有規定的尺寸，不禁吃了一驚。遠樣說起來，果然是那紅甎的舊學生館，和近代式的新學生館，都好像用尺劃成綫似的，窗的開法都是一致的。</p>
<p>整頓喜歡整潔，這是太婆的興趣，但是江田島的整頓，是基於軍規紀律的。所以整頓的方法，不但要細心，同時必須要　　和精神。眞人的整床，雖然完備兩個條件。而還缺一個，這就是新　號的悲哀。</p>
<p>做捷的章程，就是令全體的學生，出入學生館和敎室　時候，實行跑步。脚步一定要整齊的</p>
<p>一做甚麼，悠悠忽忽地。沒有長進！」對學生們沒有比這樣再不名譽的叱辱了。</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>真人在這個學校，感覺到上級生要比先生還可怕。分隊監事的S少佐曾經說過，要以上級生爲自己的哥哥，的確是可怕的哥哥們伍長和副伍長，雖然可怕，而週班學生更是可怕。據說是週班是同軍艦上的甲板士官相等，一號學生每週輸流增被指定作週班，担任維持軍規紀律，袖上帶着袖章，瞪　閃雷似的眼睛，一有違反規律的時候，「慢着！」大聲的呌着。</p>
<p>眞人們，在最初的兩星期，一點也沒被中斥過。學生須知，學生館的工作和禮法，都學得厭倦了。這個期間，據說是準備敎育期間。</p>
<p>但是兩星期遠去以後的第二天！從第十五日那天起，便受了嚴厲的斥責。就是開着一個鈕扣，戚者鞋帶鬆開，也要吃雷義的。細想起來，都是在準備敎育期間裏學過的事情，但是仍舊脫不掉中學生的寗氣，像這等的小事，是沒在意中的。並且敝衣破帽，不恥惡衣，是眞人故鄉學生的風習。</p>
<p>「慢着！你的皮鞋怎麼了？不擦麼。」眞人被分隊伍畏嚴厲的申斥着。二中時代一個也沒有將皮鞋擦得閃亮的。</p>
<h3>婦人孩童　也會攔路敲詐　請警局及行路人注意</h3>
<p>八日下午五時半，我自四川路乘十七路電車回寓到大世界，下車步行，忽背後有一紹興口音女僕模樣者，緊拉余手，謂頃間失落鈔票三百餘元，親眼見你俯身拾去，將路攔住不令前行。繼又來一十五六歲之男孩，謂有鈔票六內元，是你拿的，將鄙人橫拖直拉，硬令如數交出。正在有口難分，旁　無措之際，適有値班巡警到來，經鄙人說明事實，並自請搜檢，結果因彼等所說之數，與鄙人身邊所帶者不符·遂相率遁去。今日與友人談及，據云近在大世界附近，亦曾見到同樣情事，因知此輩係一有組織之敲詐黨，其同道者或不僅此二人，希警局及行路人，隨時加以注意。（張季英）</p>

<h3>招待新聞界席上　醫界代表的演詞　顧南羣詞</h3>
<p>今天，乘新年之暇，醫師公會中華醫學會醫院聯合會等三團體，招待各位，承蒙光降，無任榮幸及感謝。</p>
<p>新聞界素來主持正義，發揚是非眞相，俾社會得所趨向醫界同人均表敬仰，醫師首重學識技術，亦重醫德，學識技術淺薄之人，濫充醫師，危害社會，可謂為社會之不良份子，亦可謂為醫界害羣之馬，醫德不全之醫師，見死不救，見危即棄惟利是圖，亦為醫界可鄙之人。凡此，我醫界自檢自肅之外，還須與諭界予以糾正，以保社會安寗，人羣健康。反之，已盡醫師之能事，而社會不予諒解，或因醫學為專門學術社會人士未予深切研究，隨便是非，致醫師於種種不利，我醫界固當解釋明白，與論界亦當予以正當剖析，以免寃抑。譬如，有一病兒，病已將死，醫師不及詳細診查，打一什強心針，但病太危重，救急無效，瞬息氣絕，其家族座為一針打死，社會喧傳責備醫師，其後施以屍體剖解，方知氣管白喉症而致死。捉至警局迫令解釋，醫師本未詳診，就症論斷，答以心　衰弱，社會又以為臨床診斷，旣稱心臟衰弱，病理解剖，為喉症兩不相符，責難更嚴。其　打強心針為急救手續，雖將死之人，亦必施急救，正醫師醫德之一種，且強心針，不會致人死命，此為淺近之醫理，而臨床診斷與病理解剖不符，亦非特殊事件，據外國醫界統計，臨床診斷與屍體解剖不一致者甚多，可見不能盡以不一致而即判斷醫師之不是。</p>
<p>近來醫事糾紛，數見不鮮，動搖社會之安寗深為遺憾。關於鑑別醫事是非，本為法醫之事，現在　如法醫研究所尙未恢復，我醫界擬組織「上海醫事糾紛研究會」，分呈備案。醫事倘有糾紛，該會調查經過，根據學理，詳加研究，以公正之說明，提供司法當局參考，俾社會人士之瞭解，此為當仁不讓之義務。尤其倘咎在醫師亦不稍容諱言，以明是非而保人羣安寗，區區用心，惟祈輿諭界予以同情。倘非如此補救其不幸後果，似可預料，其一危險病症有一二分可救希望，恐救之無效，咎及醫師，於是醫師，遂不顧醫德，任其自然避免，無妄之災，但此風一開，貽害險病，何堪設想。其二執行醫師業務者旣多，意外受累，或將抱自安主義，轉為他業使社會醫師減少，後學者受親友議論影響，轉習他業從此醫學，少研習及執行之人，則醫學發展有妨，人羣健康堪庫。</p>
<p>最後希望興諭界對醫事糾紛，在未判明是非之先審愼刋載，以助社會福利。</p>

<h3>Editorial: A New Interpretation of Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>In the past year, we have frequently introduced the opinions of the Japanese government and public, especially regarding Sino-Japanese relations. We have strived for thoroughness and published as much as possible. At the same time, we have provided explanations and elaborations based on our observations. Why do we do this? Because our ideal is to build a new China, achieve Sino-Japanese cooperation, and realize the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. The most important thing to achieve these ideals is that the Chinese and Japanese governments and people can truly understand each other. Only cooperation plans based on mutual understanding will avoid scratching an itch from outside the boot and achieve tangible results. The opinions of the allied governments and people represent their expectations and views on China, reflect their understanding of China, and provide insight into the effectiveness of Sino-Japanese cooperation. This is why we strive to introduce the opinions of the Japanese government and public.</p>
<p>Today, our newspaper translates an editorial from the Asahi Shimbun titled "Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation" (see page 2). Yesterday, our newspaper published a speech by Colonel Masanobu Tsuji, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, titled "A Message to Japanese Nationals in China." We will briefly analyze it as follows:</p>
<p>Colonel Tsuji said: "The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. During the course of this war, Japan has declared a new policy towards China, believing that Japan can only exist by working hand-in-hand with China, and that only by following this path can the great purpose of the war be fulfilled... If the million Japanese officers and civilians in China can regard the millions of Chinese comrades as true comrades, then the incident can be said to have been resolved early... The resolution of the Greater East Asia War depends on the handling of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and the 100,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai hold the key to resolving the incident." Colonel Tsuji emphasized the close relationship between Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War, and hoped that the million Japanese military and civilians in China would regard Chinese comrades as true comrades, believing this to be the key to resolving the incident. We believe this view is very correct and enthusiastic. We have always advocated that Sino-Japanese cooperation requires not only official cooperation, but also cooperation from all sectors of the government and the people. We should not only regard them as comrades, but also view the livelihood problems of the Chinese people as the livelihood problems of the Japanese people, and as a prerequisite for Sino-Japanese cooperation. We should do our best to help improve the suffering of the Chinese people. To put it bluntly, Japanese officials and civilians in China must have a heart of "if others are hungry, I am hungry; if others are drowning, I am drowning" towards the livelihood problems of the Chinese people, and then help improve them. Colonel Tsuji also cited the example of paying respects to Chiang Kai-shek's mother's tomb on the order of the Japanese military commander, demonstrating goodwill. He also said, "If we treat others with sincerity, we will never be without followers." However, we would like to offer advice to Colonel Tsuji and the Japanese government and public: If Japanese people show respect for the ancestral tombs of Chinese people, it will undoubtedly enhance the feelings between them. However, respecting ancestral tombs is only one aspect of the method. It must be extended to mutual respect in all aspects for the meaning to be broader. At the same time, we believe that all Chinese people have mothers, and every Chinese person has ancestral tombs. If we can extend the goodwill of respecting Chiang Kai-shek's mother to the mothers of ordinary people, we can have a comprehensive emotional impact on the Chinese people. Only by using goodwill in this way can we sow seeds widely in the hearts of the Chinese people. If we treat the Chinese people with such sincerity, then there will naturally be no problem with the Chinese people following us. Therefore, we repeatedly advocate that Japan should cooperate with China and strengthen China, targeting the Chinese people. Then cooperation and strengthening can achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we only target the Chinese government or a small number of people, then cooperation and strengthening will inevitably lead to half the result with twice the effort. We hope that Japanese officials and the public will grasp this key point when implementing policies towards China.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun's discussion on "Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation" has many points that are the same as what we have always advocated. In our editorial on December 8th of last year, the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, titled "The Greater East Asia War and the Rise and Fall of China," we said: "What our Chinese compatriots must realize at present is that the realization of the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. That is, how to win the war is the first condition, and all goals must be focused on this. We must also realize that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one. The rise and fall of East Asia depends on this battle, and the rise and fall of China also depends on this battle." Now, the Asahi Shimbun editorial says: "Maintaining China's independence and realizing the Sino-Japanese Treaty cannot but be sought in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one." The arguments are in agreement. The Asahi Shimbun editorial also said: Chairman Wang proposed three tasks: rectifying ideology, ensuring security, and increasing production, as measures to further strengthen the political power of the National Government. In particular, increasing production is the foundation for the revival and construction of China's economy and for ensuring China's independence. Therefore, Japan respects the National Government's economic autonomy and implements various forms of cooperation. However, we believe that the three points proposed by Chairman Wang are all important, but there is a prerequisite for achieving these three goals, which is "political reform." And political reform should start with improving people's livelihoods. Therefore, we advocate establishing public opinion organs as soon as possible so that the people's opinions on improving their lives can be heard and realized.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Cross the Mayu River, Expanding Battle Results in the Southwest, Enemy Transport Ship Sunk off Chittagong Coast</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 10th the following war situation in the Buthidaung-Maungdaw area of the India-Burma border: After crossing the Mayu River near Tongbazar, Japanese troops are now advancing south along the west bank of the river, echoing the troops advancing north after breaking through the enemy lines in the Buthidaung front, and are encircling the main force of the enemy east of the Mayu Mountains. A powerful Japanese unit has climbed the Mayu Mountains from Tongbazar and continued to advance, destroying the bridge in Nakyianyang on February 6th, securing the area and cutting off the retreat route for the enemy forces in the Maungdaw area. Japanese air squadrons have been dispatched daily to closely cooperate with the ground forces in the area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese military frontline base in Burma on the 10th, the British Indian 7th and 5th Divisions attempted to counterattack on the Buthidaung and Teknaf fronts, but after being subjected to a preemptive general offensive by the Japanese army, they retreated towards Maungdaw, repeating their "Arakan Tragedy." They were also pursued and bombed by Japanese army air squadrons for several days, causing further chaos.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese naval frontline base in the Indian Ocean, a Japanese naval air unit discovered an 8,000-ton enemy transport ship off the coast of Chittagong at dawn on the 9th and immediately bombed it, sinking it. The Japanese military suffered no losses in this operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a Japanese military base in the Indian Ocean, Japanese naval air squadrons bombed enemy military facilities in Kalkudah, 10 miles north of Batticaloa on Ceylon Island, at dawn on the 8th, with all bombs hitting their targets. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>Review of the Current State of Naval Warfare: Anti-Axis Powers Have Difficulty Achieving Results; Japanese Military's Preemptive Strike Deals Blow to Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army and the Indian National Army in Burma are working hand in hand and have launched a brave offensive war in the rugged terrain of the Mayu Mountains, gradually suppressing the lifeline of the British Indian army. The war situation in that area is progressing very smoothly. The fact that the Japanese army quickly achieved results with precise tactics has also been acknowledged by the enemy. In their war situation bulletin issued on the 5th, the enemy stated that the Japanese army had made a surprise attack on Tongbazar, a key point on the banks of the Mayu River in front of Buthidaung, and occupied the area, and are now expanding battle results to the southwest of the area. It is not difficult to imagine that this preemptive attack by the Japanese army has dealt a great blow to the British Indian army that was gathering on the Burma-India border waiting for an opportunity. Since Mountbatten took office, both sides have recognized that the battle will mainly be at sea. However, due to the Japanese military's preemptive operations, their attempt to counterattack from land has been thwarted. So how will the enemy's main counterattack, naval warfare, be carried out? Now, let's examine the current state of the naval counteroffensive that Mountbatten mentioned: The famous British military commentator Fuller once lamented that the India-Burma war front is very different from the Pacific war front. Mountbatten's counteroffensive must cross the Bay of Bengal, and on this front, it must first encounter the attack of strong Japanese land forces. The Japanese army in Burma and Thailand has actively improved roads and can quickly move troops. This means that our invasion operations must include forces that can match the strong Japanese army, that is, the initial stage of the war must also involve a large-scale landing operation with communication lines. Is this kind of landing operation possible for Mountbatten now? It is by no means easy to subdue the Japanese army. The last major offensive of the anti-Axis powers will have to be postponed until a time when they can deploy forces that are far superior to what they have now. This is probably the enemy's operational view for the counteroffensive in Southeast Asia. However, the enemy's operations still face several basic difficulties: The European Second Front problem. Due to the recent changes in the European situation, the situation is becoming more critical, so the anti-Axis forces should prepare for it accordingly. The preparations for aircraft to cover the landing forces, as well as landing ships, are insufficient. The Japanese military's defensive positions in the occupied territories of the Indian Ocean coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are extremely tight. The issue of control of the air and sea in the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, the Japanese army now has the cooperation of the Free Indian National Army, and the fact that the Indian National Army has begun to advance towards Delhi has had a great impact on the emotions in India. It is expected that the situation in India will become increasingly treacherous. All of these are the root causes that eliminate the enemy's determination to counterattack. In short, the enemy's naval counteroffensive faces various difficulties, and it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve results immediately. However, after the rainy season last year, the enemy has been making various efforts on the India-Burma border, actively replenishing naval counteroffensive preparations. In Calcutta, Ceylon Island, and Trincomalee, they continue to gather North African troops who are accustomed to tropical warfare. At the same time, part of the British Mediterranean Fleet has also been transferred to the Indian Ocean, and large-scale landing exercises are being conducted along the coast of Bengal. A large number of military supplies are being accumulated in Chittagong and Ceylon Island. From this, it can be seen that after failing on the land front, the enemy has long intended to launch a naval counteroffensive to save face.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence Movement Reaches Final Stage; Bose Answers Questions from Reporters on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain location in Burma: Since the Free Indian National Army became active in the Arakan front, the morale of the soldiers has been soaring. Commander-in-Chief Bose is personally directing operations near the Burma-India border in an effort to fulfill the long-cherished hopes of the Indian people. In order to inquire about the facts, reporters visited Commander-in-Chief Bose at a certain headquarters on the 9th, and learned about the Commander-in-Chief's determination to complete the independence of his homeland and the fighting spirit of the National Army. Since the National Army began its attack, the Commander-in-Chief, despite being busy with military affairs, has continued to instruct and encourage the soldiers. When the reporters met the Commander-in-Chief, he was reading a map and conducting detailed research. The Commander-in-Chief was wearing a military uniform, with a majestic and solemn demeanor. While answering the reporters, he stared at the map, filled with the spirit of loving his homeland. Therefore, Mr. Bose has inspired the Indians who are under the shackles of British rule and the Indian National Army that is engaged in the attack on Delhi. Mr. Bose told the reporters that he was confident that "we will be able to complete our independence, there is no doubt about it." He also answered the reporters' questions as follows: Question: What are your thoughts after the Provisional Government of Free India moved to Burma? Answer: When I was in Syonan, I planned to spiritually and materially mobilize the three million Indians residing in East Asia, concentrate their strength, and drive out British forces. This was a preparatory process. After arriving in Burma, my emotions have been drawn to the future of my homeland, and my vision has been focused on the Arakan region. All of my past time has been spent on gathering the National Army in East Asia, and I have stood on the forefront of East Asia and started formal activities. Question: What are your thoughts on the National Army starting its attack? Answer: Our independence movement has reached its final stage. What we should strive for in the future is to continue the attack until the day we occupy Delhi.</p>

Therefore, the Village Clearing Affairs Bureau was established within the Executive Yuan, and village clearing affairs bureaus were separately established in various provinces and cities to specialize in this matter. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the generals, officials, and our compatriots, the village clearing plan has been implemented step by step, which is commendable. What is particularly memorable is that the Allied forces, even in the midst of the Great East Asia War, have spared their strength to assist in village clearing, enabling coordinated progress and achieving the expected results. I would like to express my respect and gratitude for this.</p>
<p>This village clearing conference is convened in light of the progress of the current situation, bringing together those responsible from the central and local governments to conduct a thorough review of past work and carefully plan future actions, so as to ensure that village clearing work meets the needs of the total decisive battle and achieves more epoch-making expansion and depth.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Nanzheng and Xi'an</h3>
<p>Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) On the 9th, Japanese army air units, in a joint large-scale formation of fighter-bombers, launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing air force base in Nanzheng, a strategic point in Shaanxi Province. Although the Chongqing army learned of the Japanese army's attack, they did not see Chongqing planes to counterattack, so the Japanese planes were able to arbitrarily drop bombs on their military facilities, and after reaching their objectives, they safely returned to their original defenses. On the morning of the 10th, Japanese army planes again launched a surprise attack on the Xi'an Chongqing airport in a joint formation of fighter-bombers, carrying out fierce bombing. After thoroughly destroying its runway and other military facilities, they safely returned to their defenses.</p>

<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>In the recent Japanese Diet, Japan's fixed policy toward China was clearly clarified. Minister of East Asia Aoki clearly stated the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Since the National Government's participation in the war and Sino-Japanese cooperation have moved toward the goal of destroying Britain and the United States, the relationship between the two countries has shown epoch-making progress. Especially as a result of the National Government's self-strengthening policy, Japan has concluded an alliance treaty with China without any hesitation. The foundation of the relationship between the two countries, after the forces of Britain and the United States have been expelled and the root causes of disrupting Sino-Japanese relations have been eradicated, is of course based on mutual trust and cooperation, and the concepts of rights and interests and opposition have been completely swept away. Japan's policy toward China is being promoted along this direction.</p>
<p>Regarding the direction of this policy toward China, it was clearly stated in the Committee on Amendment of the North China Development and Central China Revitalization Companies Law of the House of Representatives on January 31 that Japan's new policy toward China intends to prepare and develop the situation based on the creativity and efforts of the Chinese side, and if the situation permits in the future, the two companies will also be adjusted according to the concept of the new policy.</p>
<p>Due to Japan's implementation of the new policy toward China, Sino-Japanese relations have embarked on the right track. However, although it is on the right track, it still does not move forward. If efforts are slackened after this, the previous achievements will be wasted. To make it move toward a common goal, the Sino-Japanese dynasties should concentrate their efforts on understanding and strengthening cooperation between the two countries. While Japan is cultivating China's creativity (translator's note, meaning autonomy) and strength, at the same time, the Chinese side must also be strictly vigilant, not to emphasize autonomy to the Japanese side too much, resulting in 背道而馳.</p>
<p>As for the way in which China cooperates to complete the war, Chairman Wang proposed three items: straightening out ideology, ensuring治安, and enhancing production. These are all measures to further strengthen the political power of the National Government. Especially enhancing production, the economic revival and construction of China is the foundation for ensuring China's independence. Therefore, Japan respects the National Government's economic autonomy, in order to help its self-strengthening construction, implements the transfer of the right to control the movement of materials, the Sino-Japanese equality of purchasing and allocating materials, and the transfer of new enemy property and military-managed factories, etc., and expects the Chinese side to actively act based on its creativity and responsibility.</p>
<p>In view of the requirements of the current stage of the war, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should of course focus on enhancing combat power. Seeing that enhancing production cannot but take China's cooperation in completing the Great East Asia War as its own goal. China's assistance to Japan's combat power, especially the contribution of military supplies in North China, is the most significant. However, the current situation of economic recovery and production enhancement in other regions, especially in Central China, cannot be said to be satisfactory. The rising prices of goods on the Chinese mainland are not only brewing a worrying situation that threatens people's livelihoods, but also, as a result, national capital is engaged in hoarding goods, while production continues to fall into a stagnant process. Needless to say, this situation hinders China's wartime economic construction and hinders the enhancement of combat power, and absolutely cannot be allowed to develop naturally. However, because it has been accumulated gradually and is complicated and繁琐, its countermeasures are also quite difficult. However, no matter what, a solution must be found. If China and Japan have not gone wrong on the road of co-prosperity, are full of enthusiasm to complete a common goal, and the two countries can truly become one and implement emergency measures, we believe this is by no means impossible.</p>
<p>Maintaining China's independence and realizing the Sino-Japanese treaty cannot but be sought in the victory of the Great East Asia War. The fate of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one. We hope that the Chinese people fully understand that the fate of Sino-Japanese is really more than the victory or defeat of the Great East Asia War, and join hands with the 1 billion people of the Great East Asia to destroy the enemy and fight until the day of final victory.

<h3>The Rice Control Commission Promotes Purchases, Implements Goods Exchange, and Insists on a Consistent Policy with No Change in Rice Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that the Rice and Grain Control Commission has made some changes to its lower-level agencies, and at the same time, the purchase prices must be changed, and the regulations on rice and grain transportation and sales management will be revised. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Director Yuan of the Rice Control Commission and asked him about the truth. He was kind enough to issue a written statement as follows: This committee often and constantly communicates or holds meetings with various related agencies. It is purely because it feels the difficulty of its own responsibility, and it is for the sake of research on work, so as to make the four tasks of mining, transportation, storage, and distribution smooth, so that both military and civilian food can be relied upon, but it still insists on a consistent policy and strives to carry out the work, and has never considered other changes.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Organization of the Procurement Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of lower-level agencies, when this committee designated the Rice and Grain Procurement Preparatory Committee, it reviewed the purchasing ability of each　preparatory committee member. Since the implementation of procurement, anyone who is unable to do so or who has not paid enough for the quantity ordered has been eliminated and had their preparatory qualifications revoked, and the equivalent committees with excellent results have been officially　組 public associations in the shortest possible time, so as to become a permanent rice and grain procurement agency and specialize in future and future procurement tasks. The existing preparatory committees should understand the importance and responsibility of their own mission and strive to complete their mission. As for those existing preparatory committees whose results are not good, they will still be督饬or even have their qualifications revoked. If it is found that there is damage to this committee and other aspects, appropriate sanctions and punishments will be given.</p>
<p>Purchase Prices Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of purchase prices, this committee carefully considered it and presented it for promulgation and implementation, but some unscrupulous merchants still traded at high prices in secret, which caused various speculations from the outside world, which are all untrue. This committee still insists on the established policy and has not changed it. When the committee decided on the standard for purchase prices, it conducted a meticulous study of the current　environment and future price trends, and there is currently no reason to change it. Regarding the method of rice and grain transportation, it should still be strictly implemented in the future, and those who deliberately violate the laws and regulations should be strictly banned by the主管agencies.</p>
<p>Goods Exchange to Promote Purchases</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan also said that recently, as farmers' daily necessities have become increasingly expensive, they feel deeply pained, so this committee will use cotton cloth, matches, 洋燭, soap, etc. as exchange materials at reasonable prices for farmers who sell rice and grain, so as to promote the smooth progress of the purchase work, and it will be implemented in the near future, but the exchange time is limited. Those who观望and delay will have their allocation gradually reduced or even terminated.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Black Market Transactions</p>
<p>Furthermore, serious actions are being planned to prohibit black market transactions in rice and grain. As for the preparatory committee members, if they purchase rice and grain from farmers without leading them to sell directly to this committee, and they secretly搬遝 for profit or hope to hoard them, the crime is heinous and is truly the spirit of food administration. Once discovered, they should be severely punished. In short, this committee was suddenly established last winter, and everything was created from scratch, so it is inevitable that there are some regrets. Now we are gradually seeking to strengthen it. Fortunately, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have given various kinds of cooperation and strengthened the prohibition measures, and we dare not懈怠 in accomplishing our mission. We hope that all circles will understand and assist us, which is not only the happiness of　登.</p>
<h3>The 62nd Issue of Rice Flour Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Two Sheng of White Rice and One Jin of No. 2 Flour</h3>

Furthermore, all rice stores and rice warehouses in this district will be temporarily closed for one day on February 20th of this year. This announcement does not apply to the newly merged Shanghai West District.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Propaganda Office Will Host Two Department Heads Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In order to bid farewell to Mr. Hirota, the outgoing head of the information department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, and to welcome Mr. Matsudaira, the newly appointed head of the information department, the Municipal Propaganda Office, in conjunction with the relevant propaganda agencies in this city, has scheduled a grand reception tea party to be held at the International Hotel on the 14th floor at 3:00 p.m. on the明(12th). It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Purchase Certificates for Distributed Goods in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The distribution of purchase certificates for goods such as soap, matches, and coal briquettes in Nanshi is being carried out based on a per capita basis. The purchase certificates for all the goods are being monitored and distributed by the members of the Municipal Baojia Committee and the Baojia Offices of the Seven Districts, as well as the Baojia Consumer Cooperatives, at the respective Lianbao offices in recent days. However, due to the large number of people, the distribution could not be completed as scheduled. The original dates for the distribution of each fang have been changed. As soon as one fang's distribution is completed, the second fang will be distributed, and so on until the distribution is completed universally.</p>
<h3>News from Matsudaira, Head of the Information Department: First Meeting with Reporters, Discussing Political Changes After the Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that Mr. Matsudaira, the head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, held a regular press conference at the Hua Chou Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 10th). He introduced the newly appointed head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Mr. Matsudaira, to the newly formed Chinese reporters group in the city. Mr. Hirota, the former head of the Information Department, first delivered a speech of introduction, which briefly stated: "Secretary Matsudaira has come to Shanghai from Kyoto this time to take on the important responsibility of the head of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office. I deeply hope that the press circles of this city will continue to provide as much assistance as before. Secretary Matsudaira has resided in China for over ten years, and his contact with everyone will naturally be even closer in the future." Following this, Mr. Matsudaira discussed the political changes after the recovery of the concessions and expressed his hope for the cooperation of the Shanghai press to complete the task. The content of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Hope for Joint Cooperation with the Press</p>
<p>I have been transferred to the Shanghai Embassy Office to be specifically in charge of press relations. I am determined to engage with all parties with the sincerity and faith of the past, only speaking frankly and objectively, without resorting to clichés. Regarding this point, I hope the Chinese press will understand and provide cooperation.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's economic center and a cultural hub. The demeanor of the Chinese people in Shanghai is a major factor in determining China's fate. Therefore, Britain consistently insisted on Shanghai's neutrality. Exaggerated and malicious propaganda about minor defects in Chinese politics caused the Chinese people to naturally lose faith in Chinese politics. As a result, the Chinese people in the concessions took a critical stance towards Chinese politics. Until the recovery of the concessions on July 30th of last year, an unprecedented political transformation took place.</p>
<p>Wiping Out the Remnants of Anglo-American Thought</p>
<p>However, the influence of Anglo-American policies, which have been poisoning minds for a century, has not yet been completely eradicated. The media is a public instrument, so the press bears a significant mission. It should not only think about its own interests but should also act as a mouthpiece for the nation, society, and East Asia, taking the lead as ideological warriors to wipe out the remnants of Anglo-American thought and restore Shanghai to a Chinese and East Asian Shanghai.</p>
<p>Today, the war has entered a decisive stage. Before Japan can utilize all resources from the Southern Territories to replenish its war effort, the enemy is conducting opportunistic operations in an attempt to recover the loss of prestige from being unable to open a second European front and being powerless to carry out a counter-offensive operation in Burma. However, this war is a war to preserve the autonomy and independence of Asia, a war for the survival and self-defense of Asia, and a war that determines the destiny of Asia. Asia, which has groaned under Anglo-American tyranny for three hundred years, has today restored its nominal independence and freedom and has taken on the important responsibility of assisting India and others in restoring their independence and autonomy. We firmly believe that with continuous efforts, there will inevitably be a day when we achieve our goals. We hope that the Shanghai press will cooperate in completing this task.</p>
<h3>Second Air Defense Day: Exercises Were Very Successful, and Light Control Showed Even More Progress</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters designated the ninth day of each month as "Air Defense Day" to enlighten the public about air defense knowledge. The day before yesterday (the 9th) was the city's second Air Defense Day. Various districts throughout the city held various air defense exercises, such as firefighting, first aid, and bomb sheltering. Light control was implemented that evening. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the person in charge of the headquarters and asked for details: "The air defense exercises held in various districts this time were participated in by passersby, and the results were very good. The light control exercises showed even more significant progress. Only in the eighth district did a small number of households still have light leaking out at the beginning, but after warnings, improvements were made immediately. It is hoped that citizens will pay even closer attention in the future to prevent any unfortunate events from occurring and to maintain the safety of the lives and property of all citizens in the city."</p>
<p>Sheltering from Bombs: Clothing Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>He continued, "However, when the public hears a bomb descending, they should cover their ears with both hands and lie flat on the ground. However, during the exercises, people often supported themselves on the ground with both hands, with their bodies curled up in an arc shape, which is inappropriate. Once an event occurs, the eardrums will inevitably rupture, causing deafness, and eyes will be injured. They may even be hit by shrapnel, which is quite dangerous. Also, when the widespread exercises were implemented this time, nineteen out of twenty people wore long gowns and overcoats, which caused inconvenience for various measures. Some women wore shorts, and although they wore stockings, their bare skin was easily injured. Therefore, citizens should correct and quickly improve the above two points."</p>
<h3>Japanese Movie Star Bando Tsumasaburo Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Three years ago, the Chinese and Japanese film industries decided to cooperate in producing the film "Spring River Regret." The story of the film is based on historical events during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Japan sent two famous playwrights to Shanghai to collect relevant historical materials, which took more than a year to complete. The film will be co-produced by the China Film United Company and the Dai Nippon Eiga (Greater Japan Motion Picture Company), with the first-class directors and stars from China and Japan jointly participating. The famous first-class Japanese male star Bando Tsumasaburo and the head of the Dai Nippon Eiga Production Bureau, Soga Masashi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM from Tokyo. They immediately hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at their residence. The head of the Production Bureau, Soga Masashi, announced the purpose of producing the film, which is to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and awaken the consciousness of the hundreds of millions of people in East Asia to strike down the Anglo-Americans and seek their own liberation.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Cotton Cloth to Be Implemented in Late February: 1.5 Zhang Per Person</h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the rationing of cotton cloth is scheduled to be implemented in late February. It is reported that the rationing quantity will be 1.5 zhang per person.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Extorting Passengers: Strict Crackdown Decided</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that rickshaw pullers in the city have been arbitrarily increasing fares. The Public Utilities Bureau has summoned the heads of various companies to reprimand them. The industry association has published a statement admitting that it is inappropriate. At the same time, it has pleaded with the authorities for understanding, citing the rising costs. The bureau has forwarded this to the city government for approval to make appropriate adjustments. However, in order to maintain market benefits and protect the interests of the people, the decision has been made to strictly crack down on pullers extorting extra money from passengers. The current fare schedule for rickshaws is listed below (the tip is included): For double-person rickshaws, the minimum is 30 yuan for every 30 minutes, with an additional 5 yuan for every additional 5 minutes. For single-person rickshaws, the minimum is 20 yuan for every 30 minutes, with an additional 3 yuan for every additional 5 minutes.</p>
<h3>Using Gold for Speculation: Authorities Implement Investigation to Stabilize People's Livelihoods, Suppression Is Necessary</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency reports that the recent soaring gold prices have caused other commodity prices to skyrocket, drawing the attention of the authorities. Yesterday morning, many plainclothes detectives were dispatched to locations engaging in gold bar trading to conduct investigations. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the situation. The response was: "Recently, gold trading has often deviated from the norm. In the past, the authorities, in consideration of the needs of citizens for making essential ornaments, allowed silver shops and other stores selling gold ornaments to resume business. It was originally hoped that those engaged in this business would abide by the law, meet actual needs, and not engage in speculative trading or hoarding. Unexpectedly, recently, a group of speculative merchants has disregarded the law and engaged in flights of fancy, once again using gold as a target for speculation and hoarding, arbitrarily manipulating prices. The impact of this is sufficient to disrupt the financial system, affect commodity prices, and cause hardship to the people's livelihoods. For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihoods, it is indeed necessary to continue investigations and suppress these activities."</p>
<p>Sports</p>

<p>Nanyang School Principal Benefits Impoverished Students</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wang Peisun, the principal of Nanyang Middle School in the city, told a reporter from this newspaper: "This semester, there are a considerable number of students in our school who have been approved to receive grants. Our school believes that these students are all children of impoverished families. In order to show preferential treatment, all tuition fees for this semester will be waived. The grant checks will be used to subsidize the living expenses of these students." Principal Wang's kindness and compassion and his enthusiasm for helping students have deeply moved us. We sincerely hope that private schools at all levels in the city will, according to their economic capabilities, consider giving impoverished students the opportunity to reduce or waive tuition fees, so that Principal Wang of Nanyang Middle School is not the only one doing so. The students would be very fortunate.</p>

<h3>Commentary: Exceeding Price Limits</h3>
<p>Before the Lunar New Year, prices in Shanghai had already begun to rise alarmingly. After the Lunar New Year, the wind of price increases has become even more like a howling gale. The spread of price increases simply makes people feel that every blade of grass is an enemy, and the working class and housewives in particular feel increasingly besieged and at a loss as to how to continue living. This phenomenon is probably rare in wartime cities around the world. Since the start of the war, price increases have been a common phenomenon in various countries, but the rate and extent of these increases has never been like the price increases in Shanghai today. Prices double today, then double again tomorrow, to five times, ten times, and even hundreds or thousands of times. Even within a single day, afternoon prices are higher than morning prices. Up and down the street, prices in this store exceed those in that store. Prices are quoted arbitrarily, with no standard. When asked, sellers increase prices as they please, and buyers buy as they are able. This creates a situation where the more prices rise, the more people buy, and the more people buy, the more prices rise. Consequently, both price levels and the lives of ordinary people suffer a catastrophic and irreversible fate.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the city's police authorities, in order to effectively crack down on price gouging in various industries, have decided to strictly enforce the rules without leniency. At the same time, the government has issued a notice to all public associations and commercial firms stating that any price increases in the future must be submitted to the Price Evaluation Committee for review. The Economic Bureau has already been approved to establish a Price Evaluation Committee, and from now on, the Central Market will no longer enforce price evaluations. In the countermeasures to balance prices, setting official prices and cracking down on profiteering are only stopgap measures. However, under today's severe price situation, how can we proceed without first taking stopgap measures? In that case, the responsibility for future prices must be fully entrusted to the Economic and Police Bureaus; otherwise, the price problem in Shanghai will truly be unmanageable.</p>
<h3>Strict Control of Buying and Selling in Various Industries: Authorities Discuss Countermeasures: Manufacturers Must Not Sell to Hoarders</h3>
<p>Recently, the price surge in the city has become increasingly violent. At the same time, buying and selling in various industries is also fluctuating. The general middle and lower class citizens have clearly suffered a serious threat. Yesterday, reporters learned from various sources that the relevant authorities in the city, in order to thoroughly suppress prices and sustainably stabilize industry and commerce, have been holding meetings in recent days to discuss sound and effective measures. The authorities have now discussed new countermeasures to suppress prices and will separately send letters to various industry associations, instructing members of the same industry to implement them together. The authorities will also authorize these associations to be responsible for supervising the buying and selling of the same industry. If any violations are found, they must be reported to the authorities for legal sanctions. If any company or commercial firm, regardless of its business nature, fails to conduct buying and selling in accordance with the following measures, it will be handled in accordance with the above procedures.</p>
<p>Manufacturing plants must not refuse to supply finished products to legitimate commercial firms, and these commercial firms must immediately sell these materials at the limited price. Factories must not sell finished products in large quantities to non-industry people. Manufacturers with appropriate raw materials should continue to produce as usual. If commercial firms lack available goods, they must not obtain them from the black market and sell them at black market prices, in order to avoid mixing inferior goods with good ones and disrupting the market situation. At the same time, this prevents hoarders from easily releasing hoarded goods. Commercial firms must list all sales of goods, regardless of quantity, in their accounts, stating the date, price, and quantity, for authorities to check at any time. Goods stored in warehouses must not be moved without authorization. The relevant associations must verify any goods held by individuals and report them to the authorities for handling. If factories have issued warehouse receipts for a long time, they should immediately be urged to release the goods. Otherwise, the Bureau may be notified to prosecute them on charges of hoarding essential materials.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Supervisory Committee Discusses New Stocks</h3>
<p>After the Lunar New Year market opened, twenty-seven new stocks that had not been approved by the authorities were listed and traded without authorization. Because this violated the government's laws and regulations on suppressing speculative businesses, it has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. In view of this, the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and acting upon the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, recently issued a clear order to the Chinese Securities Exchange to immediately suspend the listing of unapproved stocks and await approval. Reporters have just learned that the Supervisory Committee of the Stock Exchange is scheduled to meet today (the 11th) to discuss the suppression of the listing of illegal new stocks and the effective measures to be taken in the future.</p>
<h3>Coal Slag Industry Organizes Association</h3>
<p>Leading figures in the city's coal slag industry, in order to facilitate the transfer of goods and benefit the people, have initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Special City Coal Slag Industry Association" to help members of the industry overcome difficulties, sustainably stabilize the market situation, and suppress coal slag prices. The association has already applied to the City Economic Bureau for approval and has been issued a license. It is currently registering members of the industry. As of yesterday, more than 100 firms have joined the association.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Control of Hemp to Prevent Illegal Hoarding</h3>
<p>Yesterday, reporters learned from related sources that the authorities have decided to step up the control of hemp in order to prevent illegal merchants from hoarding hemp. Without the authorization of the authorities, all hemp merchants are strictly prohibited from buying hemp. Illegal merchants, once discovered, will be prosecuted according to law on charges of hoarding essential materials. In addition, the authorities will divide areas for the movement of hemp. It can be moved freely within each area, but moving it out of or into an area requires the permission of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Erratically: Rongfeng Yarn Factory Stands Out with a Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated narrowly. Except for a few special cases, most were flat and weak. Investment targets have not returned after the shift. People in all quarters are idle and scattered. In the cultural industry, the selling price of the Commercial Press has been raised to as high as 6,000 yuan. The China Bookstore and China Film, and other companies, were weak. The Hualun Paper Mill was outstanding. In the department store industry, the Xinxin Company, which opened a general store, rose by one yuan alone. Guanghua and the Three Companies were both flat and weak. In the textile industry, Rongfeng rose by five yuan in a rush, closing at 90 yuan. Datong, Yuanyuan, Datong, Renfeng, and Daguangming were all firm. Yongan Yarn Factory and Meiya were flat. Zhongfang and other companies were low. Xinhua shares, Zhongxi, stood out, and Zhongfa and others had small plates. Chemical stocks were the flattest. Baoding Glass rose by five cents. Public utilities stocks were also flat. In the investment industry, Lia and Greater China Industrial, and Xin Ya Construction were firm. Jiuan and other industrial companies were all flat. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Kangyuan Confectionery fell. The closing prices for this evening are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Public Price Market Still Firm Yesterday the unified public bonds in the gray market saw quite active trading, and the market remained firm. There was strong buying interest from all sides, with Type C bonds seeing the most transactions. The morning opened at 2.37, then rose to 2.38, before falling back to 2.32.5. Type A bonds traded at 1.8, Type B at 1.7, Type D at 1.65, and Type E at 1.75, all gaining two to five yuan.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate Steadfast Yesterday morning, the bankers' association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at 0.2.</p>
<p>Grain and Cloth Stop Rising and Fall Back The grain market suddenly stopped rising and fell back yesterday. This was likely because the authorities had begun to pay close attention to the continuous rise in grain prices in recent days, and it was rumored that adjustments would be made to household rations. This led to a gradual decrease in buyers, and speculators were also wary of restrictions and refrained from activity. As a result, both thick and thin japonica rice prices fell slightly, and oil grains also declined rapidly. Crude soybean oil fell by three to five levels, and soybeans and other products also showed a downward trend.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials Market Situation Steady The market situation was quite steady yesterday, with prices remaining largely unchanged from the previous day. White wax was priced at 3.1, Vaseline at 2.5, caustic soda at 6.7, and packaged sodium bicarbonate at 1.2.</p>
<p>Rayon Still Weak and Soft Rayon remained weak and soft yesterday, with trading particularly sluggish. The price of 120-count Tianqiao rayon continued to fall by two levels to 9.6.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Limited Transactions Retail sales were limited yesterday because the spring sales season had not yet arrived. The items displayed by the various stores were mostly women's fabrics made of lower-grade wool. Wholesale transactions were limited due to tight credit. Banks have reduced credit lending, and most transactions were not sent out after discounts. The lack of variety in the market and firm prices have resulted in fewer buyers, and retail transactions are limited.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Continue to Rise Yesterday, cigarettes continued to rise steadily. Great Wall cigarettes were selling for 40,000, Golden Gun for 18,000, All Green for 20,000, British Brand for 95,000, and Old Knife for 85,000.</p>

<h3>Student Number Four (8) Navy by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</h3>
<p>In front of the white reference hall, when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, the real man's life as Student Number Four became a bit more skilled. The method of saluting, raising his hand and adjusting his footing while walking, understanding that 13:00 is 1:00 PM, that the canvas bag for carrying books is called "Bag," that "Shirt" is a shirt, and that "Pocket" is a pocket—and also not a place to hide one's hands—gradually became clear.</p>
<p>However, at 5:30 AM, the bugle call for all members to wake up still startled him, his heart pounding in his chest, even though he was still sleepy. People often admire the speed with which the attendants on sleeper trains tidy up bedding, but in the naval academy, it must be done in half the time, and the arrangement must be twice as beautiful. This was not only a concern for the real man but also for all new Student Number Fours. It was unacceptable for the folded felt blanket to have wrinkles or not be straight. It had to be aligned in a straight line with the blanket on the adjacent bed. Even more precisely, the three lines of the fold had to be visible. One glance could tell whether it was neat or not. Furthermore, if one hesitated even a little, there would be no time for washing up or going to the restroom. From making the bed to lining up the row, there were only fifteen minutes in total. If one slacked off even slightly, there would be an "Etajima earthquake," and the upperclassman on duty would throw the entire blanket up in the air. In the end, one would have to tidy it up oneself. The real man already believed that the only solution was practice, so he was extra careful when making his bed. Because he was too slow, his classmates would laugh at him. When he went to the washroom, there was already no room to stand. The method of washing one's face was also different; to prevent infectious diseases, washbasins were not used, and one used running tap water to rinse one's mouth and wash one's face in cold water. He had already used all of his time in the washroom, and he didn't know how many times he had to economize on trips to the restroom. Fortunately, he was able to avoid the "earthquake."</p>
<p>Orderliness and agility—these were the two greatest principles of action that the real man felt. He was assigned to the new student hall, which was adorned with the imperial chrysanthemum crest, and he was surprised to hear that there were regulations for how far to open the windows according to the season—summer, hot summer, winter, and cold weather. When he thought about it, both the old red-brick student hall and the modern new student hall seemed to have lines drawn with a ruler, and the way the windows were opened was consistent.</p>
<p>A love for orderliness and cleanliness was his grandmother's hobby, but orderliness in Etajima was based on military discipline. Therefore, the method of orderliness not only had to be meticulous but also had to be unified and spirited. The real man's bed-making, although fulfilling two conditions, still lacked one, and this was the sorrow of the new student.</p>
<p>The rule of agility was to make all students run when entering or leaving the student hall and classrooms. The footsteps must be uniform.</p>
<p>"Always dilly-dallying. No progress!" There was no more dishonorable scolding for students than this.</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>In this school, the real man felt that the upperclassmen were more terrifying than the teachers. The platoon supervisor, Lieutenant Commander S, had said that upperclassmen should be treated as one's older brothers. Indeed, the older brothers were terrifying. The corporals and deputy corporals were frightening, but the weekly student was even more frightening. It was said that the weekly student was equivalent to a deck officer on a warship. Student Number One was assigned to be the weekly student in rotation, responsible for maintaining military discipline. They wore an armband on their sleeve, glared with eyes like lightning, and shouted loudly, "Stop!" whenever there was a violation of regulations.</p>
<p>The real men had not been reprimanded at all in the first two weeks. They had learned the student handbook, student hall duties, and etiquette until they were tired of it. This period was said to be a preparation education period.</p>
<p>But the day after the two weeks passed! From the fifteenth day onwards, they were severely reprimanded. Even if a button was open or a shoelace was untied, they would be struck by thunder. Thinking about it carefully, these were all things they had learned during the preparation education period, but they still couldn't shake off the childishness of middle school students. They hadn't paid attention to such small matters. Furthermore, wearing patched clothes and shabby hats and not being ashamed of poor clothing was the custom of students in the real man's hometown.</p>
<p>"Stop! What's wrong with your leather shoes? Aren't they polished?" The real man was severely reprimanded by the platoon leader. Not a single person in the Second Middle School polished their leather shoes to a shine.</p>
<h3>Women and Children Also Block the Road to Extort Money Please Pay Attention to the Police Bureau and Pedestrians</h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM on the 8th, I took the No. 17 trolleybus from Sichuan Road back to my residence at the Great World. After getting off the bus and walking, a woman who sounded like a Shaoxing maidservant suddenly grabbed my hand tightly from behind, saying that she had lost more than 300 yuan and had seen me bend down to pick it up, blocking the road and preventing me from moving forward. Then, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy came, claiming that he had 6 yuan and that I had taken it, dragging me and forcing me to hand over the money. As I was unable to explain myself and at a loss, a patrolling policeman arrived. After I explained the facts and offered to be searched, they fled together because the amount they claimed did not match what I had on me. Today, when I talked to a friend, he said that he had seen similar incidents near the Great World recently, and I realized that these people are an organized extortion gang. There may be more than just these two accomplices. I hope that the police bureau and pedestrians will pay attention to them at all times. (Zhang Jiying)</p>
<h3>Charity Schools and Educational Aid</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Changguang, a director of the Huguang Elementary School at No. 34 Luoyang Road, has donated educational aid for ten students. Any child from a truly poor family can apply for admission, and all tuition and fees will be waived.</p>
<p>The Yangguang Free Night School was founded by a group of university students and has been running for three semesters. This semester, it continues to recruit students. There are vacancies in all grades from first to sixth grade of elementary school. Tuition is free. Registration starts today. The school is located at No. 7 Xilian Jili, Huashan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, within the Jingpiao School.</p>
<p>The Minguang Middle School at No. 2 Jiaozhou Road recently received a generous donation of a total of fifty free and half-price slots from school director Mr. Guo Wenhe. Any student from a poor family with excellent grades can apply to the school.</p>
<h3>China Child Welfare Association to Regularly Solicit Funds</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, established in 1928, aims to promote child welfare and advance child welfare movements. In order to raise funds for this year's education and care expenses, the association has decided to hold a fundraising campaign from February 15th to March 31st, with a goal of one million yuan. The association's Standing Committee members, Lin Jianhou and Zhao Jinqing, have decided to invite more than one hundred social figures to serve as fundraising committee members to assist with the campaign.</p>
<h3>Selling Books for Educational Aid</h3>
<p>I plan to sell a large number of original English periodicals, including the Chinese Science and Art Magazine, the Ministry of Industry's Chinese Economic Monthly, and the American Geographical Society Monthly, totaling more than 600 copies, priced at 75,000 yuan, with one-third of the proceeds to be allocated to the Shen Bao Educational Aid Fund in the name of the beneficiary (correspondence address: Shen Bao Social Service Department).</p>
<p>Tao Guanchu, a specialist in internal medicine and gynecology, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years and has extensive experience. He is currently practicing at a clinic at the intersection of Route Ghisi and Avenue Lafayette in the Eighth District. Except for those who are able to pay, those who are unable to afford treatment and are sick can come to the clinic during consultation hours from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and the consultation will be free of charge.</p>
<p>Lost Ticket Notice A Su Shunyou ticket with a baggage ticket was found on Gordon Road. The loser can claim it with a citizen's card or identity card at Building 358, Cheng Haiwei Road (Qian Shaoji).</p>
<h3>Speech by Medical Representative at a Reception for the Press by Gu Nanqun</h3>
<p>Today, taking advantage of the New Year holiday, the Physicians' Association, the Chinese Medical Association, the Hospital Association, and other three groups are hosting you all, and we are honored and grateful for your presence.</p>
<p>The press has always upheld justice and promoted truth and falsehood so that society can move in the right direction. Medical professionals all admire this. Doctors prioritize knowledge and skills but also emphasize medical ethics. People with shallow knowledge and skills who fraudulently act as doctors harm society and can be said to be bad elements in society and a disgrace to the medical profession. Doctors with incomplete medical ethics who do not rescue the dying and abandon the endangered for profit are also despicable people in the medical profession. In addition to our medical profession's self-examination and self-discipline, we must also correct the press to protect social peace and human health. Conversely, if we have done our best as doctors and society does not understand, or because medicine is a specialized academic field that society does not deeply study, and we arbitrarily judge right and wrong, putting doctors at a disadvantage, our medical profession should explain clearly, and the press should also give a fair analysis to avoid injustice. For example, if there is a sick child who is about to die, and the doctor does not examine him in detail and gives him a shot of cardiac stimulant, but the illness is too critical, and the emergency treatment is ineffective, and he dies in an instant, his family blames the doctor for killing him with one shot, and society clamors to blame the doctor. Later, an autopsy reveals that he died of diphtheria of the trachea. They are taken to the police station and forced to explain. The doctor, not having examined him in detail, judges the illness and replies that it was heart weakness. Society then believes that the clinical diagnosis says heart weakness, but the pathological autopsy says it was a throat ailment, the two do not match, and the blame is even more severe. In fact, the cardiac stimulant shot was an emergency procedure, and even if a person is about to die, emergency treatment must be given, which is a kind of medical ethics for doctors, and a cardiac stimulant shot will not cause death. This is a simple medical principle, and the mismatch between clinical diagnosis and pathological autopsy is not a special event. According to foreign medical statistics, there are many inconsistencies between clinical diagnoses and autopsies, so one cannot judge the doctor's wrongness simply based on an inconsistency.</p>
<p>Recently, medical disputes have been common, shaking social peace and causing deep regret. Regarding the identification of medical right and wrong, it is originally the job of forensic doctors, but since the forensic medical research institute has not yet been restored, our medical profession plans to organize the "Shanghai Medical Dispute Research Association" and submit a record of it. If there are medical disputes, the association will investigate the process, conduct detailed research based on academic principles, and provide a fair explanation for the judicial authorities to refer to and for society to understand. This is an unremitting obligation. In particular, if the fault lies with the doctor, we will not conceal it in the slightest to clarify right and wrong and protect the peace of the people. Our humble intention is that the press will sympathize with us. If we do not remedy the unfortunate consequences in this way, it seems predictable that if there is a dangerous disease with a one or two percent chance of being saved, they may fear that the rescue will be ineffective and blame the doctor, so the doctor will disregard medical ethics and let it take its natural course to avoid unwarranted disasters, but if this trend starts, the harm to dangerous diseases is unimaginable. Secondly, if there are many people who perform doctor's duties and are accidentally harmed, they may adopt a self-preservation attitude and switch to other industries, reducing the number of doctors in society. Later scholars will be influenced by the discussions of relatives and friends and switch to other industries. From then on, there will be fewer people studying and practicing medicine, which will hinder the development of medicine and endanger the health of the people.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the press will be cautious in publishing medical disputes before right and wrong are clarified to help social welfare.</p>
