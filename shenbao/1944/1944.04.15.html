<h3 id="c1">經濟保安處成立以後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本市第以警察局經濟保安處，於十三日正式成立。警察當局分別發表談話，闡明成立意義晝所負使命。我們對此新機構的成立，特別感到深切的期待，所以期待的理由有二：第一，我們向來重視上海的地位，是大東亞戰爭中後方的重要基地，是全國經濟的中心，如果經濟措施上軌道，足以發生偉大的力量，貢獻於戰爭，而確保勝利的把握。然而就事富論斷，截止目前為止，上海經濟界的現象，並未發揮經濟中心應有的力量，並未克盡後方重要基地的任務；相反的，經濟措施走上不正軌的發展，形成紊亂的現象。現在成立了經濟保安處，就可從此調整經濟上的紊亂，就可使小正軌的發展導之於正軌。這是足以期待的理山之一。第二，就民生改善的觀點，上海五百萬市民的生活，最與經濟問題發生密切關係，過去因為經濟措施的不正軌，形成囤積投機，物價暴漲，使市民生活受到極天的威脅，現在成立了經濟保安處，從此調整經濟措施，逐漸消滅市民生活上的威脅。這是足以期待的另一理由。</p>
<p>所以，根據上面的兩點，我們認為經濟保安處成立的意義及共使命，今後應該充分做到上海的經濟力量，足以貢獻於大東亞戰爭。上海的經濟力量，足以改善市民生活。這兩個目標，就是經濟保安處的整個工作原則，一切措施，一切活動，都以這兩個目標為歸趨。當然，我們相信警察當局以及經濟保安處工作人員，對於工作計劃，完密規定，成竹在胸。可是，我們願乘創始之時，不妨借著代謀，以申管見。</p>
<p>「經濟保安處」，顧名思義，側重於「保安」兩字，所以，凡是擾亂經濟界安寗，妨礙經濟界安寗的一切事實與造因，都須澈底的消除與遏制，而維護安寗。進一步言不但消極的消除與遏制經濟界不安的事實與造因，更應積極的培養維護安寗的力量。舉例而言，經濟界中有官商不分，若官若商，而依賴政治力量，企圖暴利者，應即嚴加取締。在取締之時，雖遇有政治背景，尤應不股一切，大刀闊斧執行。換句話，凡認為足以妨得經濟安寗的行為，不問有無政治背景，不論事件大小，一律看待，同樣取締，老實說，縱大魚而捕小魚的作風，實際上等於白做的把戲。對於正當商人，應加保護，偶或有觸犯規章情事，先予指導，不使在在受意外麻煩。其次，對於戰時增產工作，更須保護，足以妨碍增產的病態，應協助排除。其執行程序上與罰則，應以戰時法令為依據範　。</p>
<p>孔子說：「不能正共身，如正人何？」最後我們很鄭重的提出這兩句話，貢獻於經濟保安處的工作人員，保安處本身最不易老，還是健全人事問題。我們檢討過去經濟機構，統制機構，憑藉機會，利用　位，敲詐商人者，不勝枚舉。所以經濟保安處絕對需要品格超越，否則不但失却成立意義，反為擾民工具。所堪欣慰者，處長五島先生是日本軍人的典型，公正無私，領導得人。共間並有許多專家襄助。同時，希望市民，尤其是濟經界人士，充分　力，遇有敲詐不法情事，據實告發與檢舉，因為市民協力，足以使保安工作進行順利，就是市民本身得到益處。</p>

<h3 id="c10">緬印戰役中　英美渝意見紛歧 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>補給戰的問題</p>
<p>最近重慶常使用補給戰的名詞。此與美軍前綫首腦部最近突然强調中國大陸戰綫之重要性一事有關，蓋要打倒日本，其必要條件必須使中國　大的人口特有武器，而驅之於對日戰爭的先驅，此在重慶方面，自以軍需品之補給為先決問題；一方面對日本　突的南方占領地，遮斷其軍需品之補給，亦為遂行戰爭上最要條件之一。因而當前的決戰局而是補給職，在此補給戰中獲得勝利者，可獲得最後的勝利。　主張與連結太平洋的反軸心基地及中國大陸的「尼米資攻努」之企圖，如出一轍。</p>
<p>敵軍對緬印國境的日軍攻勢視為西部第二戰綫，尤以在富康區域的進出，不僅遮斷萊多公路，且威脅印渝空中運輸，故日軍對該區域的攻勢，重慶及美國均深感狼狽。史蒂威爾親自出動前棧，使美軍指揮渝軍，因戰事不利而解職的派遺軍總司令官陳　，外由衛立煌氏繼任，英印軍亦自阿柴姆國境　道派出援軍，從事防衛。目前重慶方面的緬印作戰，專為確保此萊多公路的補給戰。二月十八日軍事委員會發言人會見新聞記者時稱：</p>
<p>「北緬甸作戰的目的在防備緬甸公路。我們目前的作職，雖是小規模的，但在戰略上有極重大的意義。」</p>
<p>二月二十日重慶英文報「民　先驅報」關於補給戰與緬印作戰揭載長篇論文，其要旨如次：</p>
<p>「過去麥克沃塞曾稱：假使以充分武器補給中国軍，而路加訓練，則可將日軍從中國大陸驅逐出去，而結東現在悲劇的鬥爭。他又主張僅封鎭及轟炸不能打倒日本。即要破壞日軍軍事要塞，非繫破日本陸軍不可。此等言詞，明白表示在可能範團內必須立即以許多武器補充中國戰織。麥克沃寨的主張，與尼業資，史蒂威爾，希諾特等美軍前綫指揮官們的意見相同，我們很為欣喜，但今日補給中國的一切武器與裝備品，不能不用空中運輸越過世界上最險峻陰的山岳地點。如其這裏有一條陸上路錢，就可以將　大的軍需品補給中國戰織。在這意義上，我們希望規在戰於北緬的補給戰速即獲得勝利。」</p>
<p>防衛萊多公路</p>
<p>然而這裏堪注目者，對於緬印國境的日軍攻勢，重慶興羹國均極表關心，而英國的態度似極冷淡。且他們的目的，在恢復緬甸全境，而重慶的目的則祇在防衛未完成的萊多路綫。英國對緬印國境攻勢的態度，祇汲汲於防術印度，祇希望在雨季之前能够阻止日軍進入印度就俗了。一部份英國人的傾向，對於奪回緬甸之作戰價值，亦給與極小的評價。這是內為英國在歐洲職綫沒有告終之前，無餘力顧到東亞戰綫的緣故。</p>
<p>但渝方對英國的此種能度甚表不慷，前綫的渝軍與英軍之間，時有軋　。而渝軍對美軍的感情，亦因美軍的盛氣凌人而起反感。並且英軍不喜美國勢力在緬甸戰統進出，正在警戒嫉視中。在日軍猛攻之前，渝，美，英三軍的結合細帶並不强靱，因而不能不逐漸敗退。重慶當局冒着補給戰的困難，取守勞作戰，而强欲附以積極的意義　，亦無非因為見到奪回緬甸已經絕望，為　　　給的民心，故出此策。</p>
<p>與此同時，　近　蒂威爾與蘇特拉特梅　頻頻宜傳增强中印空　，乃因重慶自行　露不能希望由陸路獲得對日反攻的必要物資之補給。印度國民軍的進　，在印度國內不用贊，對中國民染亦有極可怖的影饗，此由於重麼方面對此保守緘默一事　來，亦可瞭然。與印　民族運動的敵人英軍　手擊退印度國民軍，此為倡導民族主義的重　方面的致命打擊，他們在緬印作戰上，因為冒了這矛盾，乃充分暴　東亞叛逆兒的本性，並因日軍先發制人的攻　，感到孤立的威脅，極為恐懼。（翔：譯自二月廿八日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>仰光十四日中央社電　自特爾本隘路向伊姆法爾方面泊繫敵第二十三師團第三十七師旅團及第十七師團數千殘敵之日印軍各部隊，已於掃蕩敝敗軍之問時，向梅朗西方高地進繫中，與迫近梅朗後側之部隊相呼應，於摩洛戰綫之某部隊於十日更向比先波爾至伊姆法爾之公路所在之敵軍大舉進擊。自十一日以來，先鋒部隊已對比先波爾西方十公里之台林波皮及於該地西方雷馬他庫河附近之希爾基特公路至敵軍開始猛烈攻擊，因日軍迅速進擊之結果，於伊姆法爾盆地之敵第四軍團之一部其退路已被遮斷。又於梅朗之敵軍因日軍迂廻作戰關係，現已開始維續退却中。於伊姆法爾盆地之敵軍因已逐慚受日軍包國，故巳陷於混亂狀態</p>

<p>仰光十四日中央社電　日軍對巴列爾耍塞之攻擊，即行迫切，故敵方大感恐慌，逐將要塞周邊之大密林付之一炬，企圖阻止日軍之進攻，現日印軍正胃火焰向頑敵猛烈攻擊中。</p>
<p>仰光十四日中央社電　于達姆及伊巴爾中間之要衝巴列爾東方約十公里之陣地一帶，日印同盟軍與頑敵間運日展開壯烈之衝鋒戰，敵第二十師圈之主力死守巴列爾，該地東南約十五公里之顛諾巴爾堅陣之兩冀，講有無數堡壘，而顛諾巴爾至塞保姆（顛諾巴爾西北六公里）及謝那姆（顛諾巴爾西方六公里）之間，復築成帶狀陣地，敵陳地之前方埋設地雷，並橫佈鐵網三重，其附近一帶復為山岳地帶，然日印同盟軍則逐次將之一一攻被，驀然迫向巴烈爾。本月十日同盟單於飛彈如雨之情形下，以肉彈衝破敵陣中央，其後復利用黑夜實行奇製，再三衝擊敵方之重要堡壘，目下正迫隧頑敵而向西進攻中。又日印同盟軍之　他一部隊，於十日薄暮對是四五十度斜坡之西丹加奧之敵堡壘展開白刃戰，卒將之突破，刻下正在擴大戰果中。此種深陣地之攻防戰，實乃決定伊姆法爾敵第四軍運命之關頭，故敵軍之抵抗亦異常　烈，當地激戰之凄慘，實出想象之外。</p>

<p>柏林十四日中央社電　據海通社訪員許羅特稱，英美企圖破壞西·葡土。瑞典·愛爾蘭之中立，使上述各國對英美作一面之經濟供應，德外部加以密切之注視。據外部專家稱，德國重視下列各點：　對交戰國作一面之經濟拱應，即為中立之終止。　英美使用壓力，不尊重中立國權利，漠視國際協定，黑單之宜布，完全忽視中立國之主權。倫敦「每日郵報」申述此次戰爭中，不能有眞正之中立國，無與申述反軸心國可以利用中立國之物資對德作戰，而德國則不能利用。　英美之步驟倘告成功，僅有利於蘇聯而已。　各國報紙一致申述保持經濟中立之勸利，並說明德國以為必要之貨物為反軸心國所不能供應者，與中立國交換。許羅特繼稱，此問接獲情報，赫爾提出要求後，已對土西瑞典等國取外交行動，而以經濟封鎖為威脅，實際上最近對土·西·愛爾蘭採取之措置，與經濟封鐵相差甚微。土政府繼復維持戰事爆發時之政策，瑞典由於地理之原因，倘德國之煤停止供應，瑞典工業將受影響。「柏林夜報」載稱，倫教方可企圖造成此項外交政勢與進攻歐體密切聯繫之印象，反軸心國希望停止德國之輸入，藉以阻礙德國之軍需生產。該報以為對中立國之經濟壓力，或可使中立國陷於困境，而決不能使德軍需工業遭受嚴重影饗，此項政治策略，決不能代巷彊場之決戰。</p>

<p>柏林十四日中央社電　據海通社軍事記者普拉杜稱：義天利之戰事，不過為反軸心軍正式攻歐前之一種佯擊而巳。約在兩週以前，柏林軍界人士會本於納吐諾安齊沃前綫之報告，預料該處敵軍有變動新攻勢之意，然而敵援軍雖源源開至，而攻勢汔未見變動。義南卡西諾附近，敵於兩週以前，雖已以生力軍接防，然而至今仍保持沉寂局面，未見有何行動，此豈敵人故弄玄虛乎。最近邱吉爾之廣播演說中，會謂將有虛偽之警報，殆此之謂　。同時英國報章認英美空軍之加緊在法比一帶及德西部加緊破壞交通綫，為攻歐之前奏曲。倫敦泰晤士報謂美國務副卿史蒂丁尼斯適在大規模軍事行動發動之前夕，在英京進行談判，更謂其行動規模之大，為前所未見。。而美海次福雷斯特爾亦預示攻歐可於三月之內見諸事實。姑不論此等言談是有意抑　無意，但無論如何大舉攻歐之前，終不免有若干移轉他人注意之牽制行動，義大利之戰事恐亦其中之一耳。</p>

<p>— 一介</p>
<p>三月底，記者偕友人搭輸赴雨，作第一次的浙東之遊，首尾凡七日，足跡經三縣——鄞縣，奉化，餘姚——對於戰亂之後的內地情形，略有觀感，願述吿關心內地的讀者。</p>
<p>天一閣的遺跡</p>
<p>到寗波後進踪最先所到之地，為名震遐邇的范氏天一閣，閣建於明，主人為明司馬范欽，推浙東藏書第一家，迄今已歷四百有餘年。閣在一小巷中，門前頹敗荒凉，而閣前閣後的池石園林，却還楚楚可觀。我們先進尊經閣，但見一棺陳側，木片滿地，覺得有點奇怪，詢之導游者的范氏子孫，云係自己人在此合製棺材。再上天一閣，則閣上滿木灰塵，在灰塵中堆置着十廿幅范氏祖先的遺像，幾堆破破爛爛的書版，幾塊上覆木片的碑石，打開書櫥，又是十櫥九空，三五部木版書籍，算證明這裹總是藏書之地，使人對着中問那塊「賽醫樓」的匾額、不禁歎息。導游者復來從幾許遺像中拿出一幅范欽潰像來展示遊人，同行的王長者脫　膽仰一過之後，連連囑咐「這是實貝，千萬好好珍」但我想這幅有歷史價值的遺像，如任其堆在敗閣的灰塵之中，恐在不久的將來，會得不翼而飛。</p>
<p>天一閣的破落敗殘，與我們國家的命運如出一轍。想想四百餘年前的范欽，是何等的為文獻而努力，恰與我們當年的革命先烈，為建國何等犧牲一樣，只因後繼無人，不特未盡保守增益之責，甚且加以毀　斷傷，終至今日不堪收拾的地步。再說像天一閣這種有歷史文化價值的地方，倘在別個國家，公家必加愛護保存，決不任令自生自滅。這一點王長者後來會向浙東行政督察專員陶孝潔氏建議稍加修葺，並購置點普通圖書以供衆覺，聽說陶氏已欣予接受。記者切望異日重遊　上時，天一閣已能稍復舊觀。</p>
<p>自紙價飛漲以來，各地舊書之視作廢紙論斤以賣運到造紙之地為造還魂紙之用者，日報上時可見到。這是我國文化的浩劫，而浙東亦難逃此劫。寗波舊書價聞為每斤四十五元，有人購淸陳元龍著格致鐐原三十二本，價二百十元，因重量五斤半也，稱下千百萬斤舊書來。</p>
<p>敎育狀况一斑</p>
<p>寗波的敎育狀况，比較的令人滿意，計有公私立中學三，公立完全小學二十七，私立五十三，公立初小三十五，私立二百二十，敎育經費佔總支出的百分之二十三。敎師待遇，則高中每小時十一元左右，初中八元，小學敎師每月三四百元之間。區區之數，確嫌菲薄，幸而有米糧配給及學米辦法，稱可挹注。本年三月份每一敎師可得配給米五斗，價每斗六十元，學米二斗半，免費給與，原來鄞縣中小學定有徵收學米辦法，凡高初中學生每人每學期繳納一斗五升，小學高級七升，中級六升，低級五升，敎師所得學米，即在此中撥發。但是配給之米，則本月己減為一斗五升。道是因為寗波原非產米之區，諺有寗波熟三餐粥之句，每當靑黃不接之際，糧食常感不足，如何補救，實一極大問題。市米售價，則在二千六百元左右。</p>
<p>從寗波到奉化，現在仍有公共汽車按日行駛，雖一日不過一班，於行旅已大為便利。我們去時坐的小汽車，到奉化費時不到二小時，公路相當良好，沿途景色甚麓。奉化原為產挑之地，時正桃花盛開，與金黃菜花油綠豆麥相映，再加上靑由碧水相襯，置身其間，實覺愉快，而以將抵奉化那一段的風景為尤佳。不過美中不足之處。是一路行去，稻田中墳墓星羅棋布，山嶺上樹不寥寥，這一方面是殺風景，一方面是減少生產，如能田中無墳，一年問當能增產多少米麥，如能山上有樹，今日木材柴薪的價格當可滅低若干。而這不僅鄞奉途上的一地情形，全中國無數山嶺，有多少不是灌　呢！</p>
<p>奉化縣城區甚小，市面也不及租離不遠的大橋鎭。敎育相富發達，有一所初級中學，一百十八所小學，敎師待退，則除月薪四五百元之外，可以三百六十元代價得穀二百斤（約可輾米入斗左右）。由此觀之，做一個奉化學校敎師，一家肚子足以無　飢飲，而其他則無從談到，其為淸苦，亦難獨異</p>
<p>繞道溪口一遊</p>
<p>離奉化後我們又繞道至溪口一遊。這裏十蔣介石氏的生長之地，早已名震四方。風景確乎不壞，建設尤足驚人，如那武林學校校舍之宏巍，沿蔣氏住宅「素居」那條馬路之平坦，實足為全中國的模範鄕。</p>
<p>隔了一天我們又從出發至寗波餘姚一行。自　至餘，也有全共汽車按日來回一次，公路就是昔日的鐵路原路，尚覺良好。中經慈豁縣。餘姚是產　產棉復產米之縣，物資統制又甚嚴密，故民生不成多大問題。據縣長勞君語記者，本縣軍警及縣府公務人員每月配給食米三斗，價僅每斗十四元。旁枝機關公務員配給三斗，價每斗三十七元半，人民二斗，價每斗四十五元，教員五斗，價與軍警同。問他何以能如此低廉，則云向四鄉牧穀時第萬斤價一萬五千元，可輾米不四十二至四十四石。我說會不會殺賤傷農，答說所付殺價有一部分係平價日用品如肥皂火柴之類，故農民不至吃虧。</p>
<p>當　勵精圖治</p>
<p>據記者匆匆來去所得的印象，覺得今日浙東的情形，大體上不能說壞，現在是戰後也是戰時，物價之漲乃無法避免的事，只要能制止其不合理的暴漲。值得最大注意的還是治安問題。浙東現在並非全屬和區，偏鄕僻壞還有的事遊擊隊與所謂「三五支隊」，據說民間對三五支隊較少怨恨，因為他們懂得籠絡人民，例如特意派一股人馬到一鄕村，特意在飯店裏吃飯時打碎一隻碗，特意滿臉驚慌之色，特意照碗價加倍賠償。這個然是一種手段，但凡是軍警何不　用這種手段。現在浙東有陸軍第十師駐防，有保安隊捍衛，論實力，自應在遊擊隊與三五支隊之上，如能勤加訓練，忠於責守，當不難使浙東成一人民能安居樂業之區。我知道今日浙東的軍政當局正在勵精圖治，一心要使浙東九縣成一足資矜式的和平區，但願他們此志不懈，始終努力。</p>

<p>昨日下午三時，日駐華艦隊報道部，循例招待中國記者團，出席松島部長，　田大尉，就目前戰局，闡述甚詳，茲將松島部長報吿各點，擇要分錄於左：</p>
<p>外廓島嶼敵受重創</p>
<p>美國海軍自上次奇變帕勞島失敗後，至今即舉動沉寂，此恐為企圖挽回失敗之應有舉動。據華盛頓十二日電稱：美國聯合艦隊司令金氏，十二日在下院預算委員會席上發表言論謂；日本海軍在外廓島　環上之戰略，是誘使聯合軍進襲，然後使聯合軍有重大犧牲，此點甚有價値，但聯合軍必打破日軍此項戰略，進而擊滅日本帝國。所謂日木外廓島嶼環，即千島，威克島，大烏島，馬紹爾，沙羅門，新幾內亞，及荷印諸島嶼等是。美國在跳島戰　爭中，已當着失敗滋味。據金氏言論而觀，過去美　所受之損失，已極重大，不但艦艇船損害，達數百萬噸，而人力損失，亦達百萬以上。吾人常聞美方極得意之宣傳，謂在某島某島綁下炸彈若干，但其結果，恐不足抵償其犧牲船舶與人力之萬一。</p>
<p>出血戰與擊滅戰略</p>
<p>日軍作戰有外防禦綫與內防禦綫，關於外防禦綫，誠如金司令所言，目的在使敵方多受重大損失，吾人稱之曰出血戰。內防禦綫之任務在擊滅敵軍侵入力，如最近帕勞島之役，即是內防禦戰法，侵入敵軍乃為日海軍之最好殲滅對象。如以歐洲戰局作為譬喻，誠有相似之處，德蘇戰爭，德國舉大軍深入蘇聯，待至預定計劃成功，即轉移目標，退至原來陣地，是為出血戰法，如此時英美開關第二戰綫，即給予德國有擊滅英美之良好機會。此點與目前太平洋戰局，具有同樣意義。</p>
<p>印緬作戰互相呼應</p>
<p>日本陸軍在印緬之英勇戰績，是太平洋海軍作戰最顯著之呼應，由於旦陸軍之英武，伊姆法爾之陷落，即在且前，里多公路之斷絕，亦為必然之事。據十三日昭南電訊：謂據確賽情報，在新德里之蒙特巴頓東南亞洲反軸心總司令部，近移往錫蘭島。由此而觀，可知敵方之狼狽情狀，敵方此舉，已預料新德里即將陷落，預備在印度洋與緬甸間重闢一條血路。目前東綫太平洋上表面似極沉寂，西方大陸則極活躣，在沉寂之狀况中，日海軍以靜待動，只須一發現敵人，吾人即將其擊減，因日海軍早有準備在焉。</p>
<p>利用中國進攻日本</p>
<p>吾人現要求中國諸　達，注意一極重要之事項，即最近盛傳華萊士赴渝之事。據十二日華盛頓電稱：羅斯福總統派副總統華萊士為正式代表赴重懷，在蔣介石之下，作團結重慶各將領之活動。此足表現美國積極圖把持中國與侵略中國。吾人回憶大東亞戰爭開始，至民國卅一年五月，日海軍即佔有大東亞海洋外圍各據點，至卅二年八月，敵方開始向外圍各綫進攻，舉全力以壓迫日本，但毫無成就，澳洲目前已無人為農作，可見其人力缺乏一斑，無論敵方之戰具船舶如何充沛，但其人力資源已至無法支持之階段，因此，敵方乃思利用中國進攻日本，其目的在用中國之人力為英美進攻之犧牲，華萊士赴渝之用意即在於此。吾人於此又可得一結論，即目前中日雙方人力，實覺罪大而有餘，只須雙方澈底合作，隽手前進則擊滅英美侵略勢力之最後勝利，必屬吾中日兩國，希中國諾　達，三復斯　為幸。</p>

<p>「抑低物價至一月份以前之水準」是政府當局所宣佈的決心，是人民公衆所得到的安慰，間題祇是在於決心能否到底，安慰能否久長。以現實而言，當局抑平物價的工作，以前日成立之經濟保布處為其最新的發展，確是在那兒不斷地努力；物品價格的一大部份，除了許多日用必需品的零售價格，確是見着相當的回跌。可是，這些現實，都還不能絕對保障物價的今後，因為抑平物價的機構是有了，還得要看其執行的方法，是否澈底；物價小回的趨勢是有了，還得要看其今後是否有再漲之可能。</p>
<p>今後的物價是否再漲，當然不能完全委其因素於執行機構之能否努力，因為增加生產與洗通物咨到底是物價政策的基本問題，可是，物價高漲之「釜底」，不能不賴經濟保安處一類的執行機構來做「抽薪」工作。若問這些「薪」是什麼，和怎樣去抽掉它們，那末，話又恐怕太多了。簡言之，今後的問題在於執行，執行的方法在於如何使營利爲目的之囤積，投機為能事之商人，在經濟保安旗幟之下，一網打盡，使其不能再去左右物價的今後。</p>

<p>嫩綠的靑草，新開的菜花，一派田野的風光。這裏，正是露飛路底陸家路一帶，也是陸家義校曁其附設託兒所的所在地。</p>
<p>推開了校園的大門，一排平房即呈現在眼前了！應接室中，坐着三位頭靠着頭正在指指點點起勁看着圖畫的小朋友，聽見有人進來，便都抬頭睜着好奇的眼看着找。後來出來了一位年輕的女敎員，招呼着我，並說明今天是兒童節，師生們都到龍華去運足了。</p>
<p>赤手空拳創辦起來</p>
<p>她陪着參觀了敎室，設備還好，牆上揭示着大小楷作文的成績，還貼有許多格言警語，訓條圖畫。據說，本校是由七八位高中生和大學生合力創辦的，只憑着一腔熱血，一顆赤心，一張小口和一雙空手，沒有錢，也沒有靠山，就這樣赤手空拳地創立起一所義校來了！後來，因了迫切的需要，又附設了一個託兒所，開辦剛近兩年，現有二百四十餘學生。由第一級直到第六級，分爲高中低三組，學生多半都是附近貧苦居民的兒童，所以學費很低，而敎職員的薪俸也極薄，——山二百元至四百元，簡直等於純盡義務，不過大半供膳宿。又參觀了她們的校園和菜圃，滿眼綠意，團中有着學生手植的樹木，圃中種滿了各種菜，菜花正散着淸香，這是呌出身平民的孩子，能够練習親手種植，採擷，嘗味，誰說內中不含有一番深刻的意味？</p>
<p>托兒所的福地</p>
<p>繞過了一大片曠野，走到王家祠堂的舊址。這裏是借做托兒所的福地的。房舍還算寬大，就有義校的校長薛小姐出來招待。據說所中因經費不足緣故，僅收留有二十個托兒，他們的家長，多半是米販，女工，成種菜的，開辦的目的，純粹是服務性質，（僅收少許膳宿費用。）每月義校　托兒所兩處開支，共需四萬元之　，她很坦白地解說：學校是窮的；托兒所當然更窮。而敎職員們也都是有力而無錢的，經費常是左支右細捉襟見肘，並且常常鬧虧空，陷在「巧婦無米」的境况中。經費的來募以外，一部份也是靠各界前往參觀的團體或個人所捐助的，所以，她們很歡迎，很切盼，外界能往參觀批評指敎，俾可有所改進。還望各界努力協助才好。</p>
<p>再說到她們實際的困難，錢，當然頂缺乏；米煤，也成大問題，其他所中的碗具，被褥，床，桌，椅，都很需要。圖書，藥品也是多多益善。</p>
<p>為孩子們祝福</p>
<p>最後，在一羣天眞活潑的兒童的　包中；在「先生好！先生好！」此停彼起，應付不暇的歡聲中，送出了我，踏上了歸途，心中默默地為這羣可愛的孩子們祝福！</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>鯊魚（二）</p>
<p>看完銀座的夜景回到艦上來後，在候補生室中，議論紛紛地大談着東風俗，這早已成為昨日的夢境了。</p>
<p>在出港準備命令未下前，候補生懷着新的夢和緊張的情緒，在熱烈地等待着命令，然而這一天，終於到來了。</p>
<p>昭和十四年十月五日，練習艦隊在響徹雲霄的啦叭聲中，走上了遠洋航行的道路。因為稍微陰天，所以波浪也並不現露出顯明的姿能來。在送客的港務部汽艇上，滿滿地全是花朶似的顏色。原來是東京附近的士官和候補生等的親屬和愛人，穿戴着華麗的妝束來送行的。</p>
<p>「祝你一路平安！」也有非常勇敢的小姐，竟自喊出比汽笛還高的聲音，向着自己的對方揮動着手帕。</p>
<p>不久後，汽艇雖然回去了，然而甲板上的候補生們，仍然還不能解除舉手禮。這是因為裏面的許多軍艦，都在舉行登舷禮而送行。</p>
<p>「敬祝一帆風順！」</p>
<p>「謝謝隆誼盛情！」</p>
<p>交換了這樣的信號。</p>
<p>然而送行，並非僅限於此。在天空上，飛機也在擺動雙翼，舉行歡送。另外三艘驅遂艦和兩艘水雷艇，曾一直送到觀音崎。</p>
<p>一切的艦隊出港，並不是全都可以得到這樣熱烈歡送的。受到樣歡送的，除了其有特別任務的艦隊外，則只有練習艦隊出港時如此。這樣也可以知道，對於練習艦隊是寄以如何的熱情與期待。</p>
<p>艦內充滿着新的活潑氣象。尤其是候補生們的而孔，都喜氣洋洋。這次航海，是他們早已熱烈盼望中的事。是到檀香山，希羅·　路特·坡納皮·特路克·帕勞羣島·　　等外國和南洋去的畏途旅行。且是吉凶禍福隨時都有變化的太平洋旅行。這一個海洋，對於年靑的候補生們說，不能不說是夢般憧憬着。</p>
<p>內地航行，雖然也是太平洋的一部份，然而對於眞人等，只有此次才感覺到這是眞正的太平洋。</p>
<p>此次航海，眞人所乘的磐手，業已成為旗艦。在桅桿上飄揚着司令旗。於是磐手號的軍艦，乘風破浪一直航行東方。陸地逐漸低下去了。頃刻間，竟消逝水平綫下。</p>
<p>「假如天氣好，還只能看見富士山。」</p>
<p>立在甲板上的士官，這樣吿訴眞人。</p>
<p>現在業已近於黃昏時分了。一眼望去，無論什麼地方，都是一片汪洋。這時汹湧澎湃的浪花</p>
<p>（這就是太平洋呵！）</p>
<p>眞人這樣地肯定了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Establishment of the Economic Security Bureau <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Security Bureau of the First Police Station in this city was officially established on the 13th. The police authorities issued separate statements, elucidating the meaning of the establishment and the missions it bears. We feel a particularly deep expectation for the establishment of this new institution, and the reasons for this expectation are twofold: First, we have always valued Shanghai's position as an important rear base in the Greater East Asia War and the economic center of the country. If economic measures are put on the right track, they will generate great power, contribute to the war, and ensure the grasp of victory. However, judging from the facts, until now, the phenomenon in Shanghai's economic circles has not exerted the power it should have as an economic center, nor has it fulfilled its mission as an important rear base. On the contrary, economic measures have taken an off-track development, forming a chaotic phenomenon. Now that the Economic Security Bureau has been established, it can adjust the economic chaos from now on and guide the off-track development to the right track. This is one of the reasons worthy of expectation. Second, from the perspective of improving people's livelihood, the lives of Shanghai's five million citizens are most closely related to economic issues. In the past, because of the off-track economic measures, hoarding and speculation were formed, and prices soared, which seriously threatened the lives of citizens. Now that the Economic Security Bureau has been established, it can adjust economic measures from now on and gradually eliminate the threats to citizens' lives. This is another reason worthy of expectation.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the above two points, we believe that the meaning and mission of the establishment of the Economic Security Bureau should be to fully realize that Shanghai's economic strength is sufficient to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and that Shanghai's economic strength is sufficient to improve the lives of its citizens. These two goals are the entire working principle of the Economic Security Bureau, and all measures and activities should be aimed at these two goals. Of course, we believe that the police authorities and the staff of the Economic Security Bureau have complete and detailed work plans in mind. However, we would like to take advantage of the initial stage and offer our humble opinions.</p>
<p>The "Economic Security Bureau," as the name suggests, focuses on the words "security." Therefore, all facts and causes that disturb the peace of the economic sphere and hinder the peace of the economic sphere must be thoroughly eliminated and curbed to maintain peace. Furthermore, not only should we passively eliminate and curb the facts and causes of unrest in the economic sphere, but we should also actively cultivate the power to maintain peace. For example, those in the economic sphere who do not distinguish between officials and merchants, and who rely on political power to seek exorbitant profits, should be severely cracked down on immediately. When cracking down, even if there is a political background, we should not hesitate to implement it with great determination. In other words, any behavior deemed to hinder economic security, regardless of whether it has a political background or the size of the incident, should be treated equally and cracked down on in the same way. To be honest, the practice of letting go of big fish and catching small fish is actually a futile trick. Legitimate merchants should be protected. If they occasionally violate regulations, they should be given guidance first so as not to be subjected to unexpected troubles. Secondly, war-time production increase work must be protected, and any unhealthy conditions that hinder production increase should be assisted in eliminating. The execution procedures and penalties should be based on war-time laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "If one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others?" Finally, we solemnly offer these two sentences to the staff of the Economic Security Bureau. The most difficult thing for the Security Bureau itself is still the issue of sound personnel. We have reviewed past economic institutions and control institutions, and there have been countless instances of those who took advantage of opportunities and positions to extort merchants. Therefore, the Economic Security Bureau absolutely needs personnel with transcendent character; otherwise, it will not only lose the meaning of its establishment but will also become a tool for disturbing the people. What is gratifying is that Director Mr. Gotō is a typical Japanese soldier, fair and selfless, and leads people well. There are also many experts assisting him. At the same time, we hope that citizens, especially those in the economic sphere, will fully cooperate and truthfully report and expose any instances of extortion or illegal activities, because the cooperation of citizens can ensure the smooth progress of security work, which will benefit the citizens themselves.</p>

Recently, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has increased its strength, and the British Air Force is also attempting to advance into the mainland, fantasizing about cutting off the Japanese army's rear supply lines and even attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland, and is working to increase base construction and strengthen its forces. But in fact, it is all for relative use. This kind of joint operation between Chongqing, Britain, and the United States cannot exert any power.</p>

<h3 id="e10">In the Burma-India Campaign, There are Differences of Opinion Between Britain, the United States, and Chongqing <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Problem of the Supply War</p>
<p>Recently, Chongqing has been frequently using the term supply war. This is related to the fact that the US frontline headquarters recently suddenly emphasized the importance of the Chinese mainland front. The necessary condition for defeating Japan is to use China's large population and unique weapons to drive it to the forefront of the war against Japan. For Chongqing, the supply of military supplies is a prerequisite. On the one hand, cutting off the supply of military supplies to the southern occupied territories that Japan has suddenly occupied is also one of the most important conditions for carrying out the war. Therefore, the current decisive battle is the supply war, and the winner in this supply war can achieve the final victory. The proposal to link the anti-Axis bases in the Pacific and the Chinese mainland, called the "Nimitz Offensive," is the same.</p>
<p>The enemy regards the Japanese army's offensive on the Burma-India border as the second western front, especially the advance in the Fukang area, which not only cuts off the Ledo Road but also threatens air transport to India and Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing and the United States are deeply embarrassed by the Japanese army's offensive in that area. Stilwell personally went to the front line, and the US military commander dismissed Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the Chongqing army, due to the unfavorable war situation, and Wei Lihuang succeeded him. The British Indian army also sent reinforcements from the Acham border to defend. Currently, Chongqing's Burma-India operations are solely for ensuring the supply war on the Ledo Road. When the spokesperson of the Military Commission met with reporters on February 18, he said:</p>
<p>"The purpose of the operation in northern Burma is to defend the Burma Road. Although our current operations are small-scale, they are of great strategic significance."</p>
<p>On February 20, Chongqing's English newspaper "The Minsheng Pioneer" published a lengthy article on the supply war and the Burma-India operations, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"In the past, MacArthur said: If the Chinese army is supplied with sufficient weapons and trained, it can drive the Japanese army out of the Chinese mainland and end the current tragic struggle. He also argued that mere blockade and bombing cannot defeat Japan. To destroy Japanese military fortresses, the Japanese army must be defeated. These words clearly indicate that China must be immediately replenished with many weapons within the possible scope. MacArthur's proposal is the same as that of Nimitz, Stilwell, Sinaut and other US frontline commanders. We are very pleased, but today all the weapons and equipment supplied to China cannot but be transported by air across the most dangerous mountain terrain in the world. If there is a land route here, it can supply a large number of military supplies to the Chinese battlefield. In this sense, we hope that the supply war in northern Burma will be won quickly."</p>
<p>Defending the Ledo Road</p>
<p>However, what is noteworthy here is that Chongqing and the United States are extremely concerned about the Japanese army's offensive on the Burma-India border, while the British attitude seems extremely indifferent. Moreover, their goal is to restore the entire territory of Burma, while Chongqing's goal is only to defend the incomplete Ledo Road. The British attitude towards the offensive on the Burma-India border is only to focus on defending India and only hopes to prevent the Japanese army from entering India before the rainy season. Some British people's tendency also gives very little evaluation to the value of the operation to regain Burma. This is because Britain has no energy to take care of the East Asian front before the European front is over.</p>
<p>However, Chongqing is very dissatisfied with Britain's ability to do this, and there are often frictions between the Chongqing army and the British army on the front line. The Chongqing army's feelings towards the US army are also disgusted by the US army's arrogance. Moreover, the British army does not like the US forces entering and exiting the Burmese battlefield and is guarding and jealous. Before the Japanese army's fierce attack, the bond between the Chongqing, US, and British armies was not strong, so they had to gradually retreat. The Chongqing authorities took the difficulty of the supply war and took the defensive, and strongly wanted to attach a positive meaning, but it was only because they saw that the recovery of Burma was hopeless.</p>
<p>At the same time, Stilwell and Suttert-Me frequently promoted the strengthening of the Sino-Indian air force, because Chongqing itself revealed that it could not hope to obtain the necessary materials for a counter-offensive against Japan by land. The advance of the Indian National Army, which is not used in India, also has an extremely terrible influence on the Chinese people. This can be clearly understood from the fact that Chongqing has kept silent on this matter. The enemy of the Indian nationalist movement, the British army, joined hands to defeat the Indian National Army. This is a fatal blow to the Chongqing aspect that advocates nationalism. They are fully exposed because they took this contradiction in the Burmese and Indian battles, and they are extremely afraid of being isolated by the Japanese army's preemptive attack.

<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese and Indian armies, consisting of the 37th Brigade of the 23rd Division and the thousands of remnants of the 17th Division of the enemy forces that had been tied up in the Imphal area from the Telpen Pass, have been advancing towards the highlands west of Meilang while sweeping away the defeated troops, echoing the forces approaching the rear of Meilang. A certain unit on the Moro front launched a large-scale attack on the enemy forces located on the highway from Bishnupur to Imphal on the 10th. Since the 11th, the vanguard troops have launched a fierce attack on the enemy forces at Tairenpoppi, 10 kilometers west of Bishnupur, and on the Shirkit highway near the Limataka River west of that location. As a result of the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the retreat route of a part of the enemy's Fourth Army in the Imphal Basin has been cut off. Moreover, the enemy forces in Meilang have begun to retreat due to the Japanese army's flanking operation. The enemy forces in the Imphal Basin are gradually being encircled by the Japanese army and are therefore in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>Bayar Fortress Launches a Bayonet Fight</p>
<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army's attack on the Bayar Fortress is imminent, so the enemy is greatly panicked and burned down the large dense forest around the fortress in an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. The Japanese and Indian armies are now fiercely attacking the stubborn enemy with flames.</p>
<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) In the area about 10 kilometers east of Bayar, a key point between Tamu and Imphal, the Japanese and Indian allied forces and the stubborn enemy are launching a magnificent charge war every day. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division is defending Bayar to the death. On both sides of the strong position of Tenno Barr, about 15 kilometers southeast of the location, there are countless bunkers. The area between Tenno Barr and Seybaum (6 kilometers northwest of Tenno Barr) and Shenam (6 kilometers west of Tenno Barr) has been built into a strip-shaped position. Mines are buried in front of the enemy's positions, and iron nets are laid horizontally in three layers. The surrounding area is a mountainous area, but the Japanese and Indian allied forces are gradually conquering them one by one, suddenly approaching Bayar. On the 10th of this month, the allied forces broke through the center of the enemy's position with flesh bombs under the rain of flying bombs, and then used a surprise attack at night to repeatedly attack the enemy's important bunkers. They are now forcing the stubborn enemy and advancing westward. In addition, another unit of the Japanese and Indian allied forces launched a bayonet fight against the enemy's bunkers in Xidanga, a 40-50 degree slope, on the evening of the 10th, and finally broke through it and is now expanding the results of the battle. This kind of deep position offensive and defensive war is actually the key to determining the fate of the enemy's Fourth Army in Imphal, so the enemy's resistance is also extremely fierce. The tragic nature of the fierce battle there is beyond imagination.</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: US officials announced yesterday that US Vice President Wallace will go to Chongqing. This matter has attracted attention from all walks of life to the relationship between Washington and Chongqing. In any case, Washington political figures and newspapers are happily discussing the matter. Washington pointed out that the US side needs to have personal contact with Chongqing in order to change the relationship. General speculation is that Wallace's visit to Chongqing is related to the Japanese army's attack on India and the panic in Chongqing. This move by the Japanese army has made the reopening of the Burma Road a bubble, and Chiang Kai-shek attacked Burma in the hope that Roosevelt would fulfill his promise after the Cairo Conference. According to news from Washington, Wallace went to Chongqing to show goodwill at Roosevelt's personal request, but it is said that due to the European war, the possibility of the US side assisting the Chongqing side is relatively limited. It is believed that Wallace will return to the United States before the Democratic Party Memorial Day, and it is implied that when Wallace is in the United States, Roosevelt may ask Willkie to serve as Vice President.</p>

<h3 id="e15">British and American Intensify Diplomatic Offensive Towards Neutral Countries; Berlin Authorities Closely Watching <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Hsu Luo-te, a correspondent for the Haitong News Agency, Britain and America are attempting to undermine the neutrality of Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Sweden, and Ireland, compelling the aforementioned countries to provide economic support solely to Britain and America. The German Foreign Ministry is closely monitoring this situation. According to experts at the Foreign Ministry, Germany emphasizes the following points: Providing one-sided economic support to belligerent nations constitutes an end to neutrality. Britain and America are using pressure, disrespecting the rights of neutral countries, disregarding international agreements, and announcing blacklists, completely ignoring the sovereignty of neutral nations. London's "Daily Mail" asserts that there can be no true neutral countries in this war, stating that the anti-Axis powers can utilize resources from neutral countries to fight Germany, while Germany cannot. If Britain and America succeed in these steps, only the Soviet Union will benefit. Newspapers from various countries unanimously advocate maintaining economic neutrality, explaining that Germany exchanges goods deemed necessary that the anti-Axis powers cannot supply, with neutral countries. Hsu Luo-te continues, stating that information has been received that after Hull made demands, diplomatic actions, threatened by economic blockades, have been taken against Turkey, Spain, and Sweden. In reality, the recent measures taken against Turkey, Spain, and Ireland differ little from economic blockades. The Turkish government continues to maintain its policy from the outbreak of the war. Due to geographical reasons, Swedish industry will be affected if Germany's coal supply is stopped. "Berlin Evening News" reports that London is attempting to create the impression that this diplomatic offensive is closely linked to an invasion of the European continent. The anti-Axis powers hope to halt Germany's imports, thereby hindering Germany's military production. The newspaper believes that economic pressure on neutral countries may put them in a difficult situation, but it will never seriously affect German military industry. This political strategy cannot replace decisive battles on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: It has been announced that the British and American ministers here jointly delivered a note to the Swedish Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon. The contents concern trade between Sweden and Germany and its allies. It is widely believed that this is one of Britain and America's methods of pressuring neutral countries. Authoritative sources told the Haitong News Agency reporter last night that the Swedish government may exchange views with other neutral governments before submitting a response, especially since there is a precedent with Switzerland. As for Sweden's attitude towards cutting off trade with Germany, it can be seen in the recent unanimous opposition to Hull's remarks in Swedish newspapers.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 14th (German News Agency) - US Under Secretary of State Stettinius announced that there are emergency issues between the British and American governments that should be discussed at length. Stettinius stated that there is no intention to establish an agreement.

<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: Reuters reports from Washington that America is scheduled to begin the trial of thirty rebels on Monday.

<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency military reporter Pu La-du, the Italian battles are merely a feint before the anti-Axis forces officially invade Europe. About two weeks ago, Berlin military figures, based on reports from the Anzio front, predicted that the enemy forces there intended to launch a new offensive. However, although enemy reinforcements have continued to arrive, the offensive has not materialized. Near Cassino in southern Italy, although the enemy replaced their troops with fresh forces two weeks ago, they have remained silent and have not taken any action. Could this be an illusion created by the enemy? In his recent broadcast speech, Churchill mentioned that there would be false alarms, which is probably what he meant. At the same time, British newspapers believe that the intensified destruction of transportation lines in France, Belgium, and western Germany by the British and American air forces is a prelude to the invasion of Europe. The London Times states that US Under Secretary of State Stettinius is conducting negotiations in the British capital on the eve of a large-scale military operation, adding that the scale of the operation is unprecedented. US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal also predicted that the invasion of Europe could materialize within three months. Regardless of whether these statements are intentional or unintentional, before a major invasion, there will inevitably be some diversionary actions to shift attention. The Italian battles are likely one of these.</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 13th that fighting continues on the Crimean Peninsula. As Soviet pressure on the German and Romanian forces intensified, they were ordered to withdraw from the eastern part of the peninsula to the new defense line prepared in the past few months.</p>
<p>German Military Strategy is Resilient</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The German forces on the Eastern Front are combining offense and defense, sometimes avoiding strength and attacking weakness, and sometimes launching counterattacks to destroy the Soviet strategy of suddenly attacking the mouth of the Danube. The German and Romanian forces between the Dniester and Prut rivers and in eastern Bukovina are resilient in offense and defense, making it difficult for the enemy to cope. Strong Soviet forces attempting to pass through the key points of Chisinau and Yablunytsia were repelled by German and Romanian troops. The most notable change is in the Carpathian Mountains. A few days ago, German forces began attacking Ternopil, Brody, and Kovel. This is to do everything possible to stop the enemy's advance in the recent Eastern Front battles, and the counterattacks taken at certain points have been effective.</p>

<p>At the end of March, I and a friend took a bus to Yu and made my first trip to eastern Zhejiang. It lasted seven days and covered three counties – Yin County, Fenghua, and Yuyao. I have some impressions of the inland situation after the war, which I would like to share with readers who care about the inland.</p>
<p>The Ruins of Tianyi Pavilion</p>
<p>After arriving in Ningbo, the first place I visited was the famous Fan's Tianyi Pavilion. The pavilion was built in the Ming Dynasty by Fan Qin, a Ming Dynasty official, and is considered the foremost private library in eastern Zhejiang, with a history of more than four hundred years. The pavilion is in a small alley, and the entrance is dilapidated and desolate, but the ponds, rocks, and gardens in front and behind the pavilion are still quite charming. We first entered the Zunjing Pavilion and saw a coffin lying on its side and wood chips all over the ground. We felt a little strange and asked the Fan family descendants who were the guides. They said that their own people were making coffins here. Then we went to Tianyi Pavilion. The pavilion was covered with dust. In the dust were stacked ten or twenty portraits of Fan's ancestors, piles of broken book blocks, and several steles covered with wooden planks. Opening the bookshelves, nine out of ten were empty. Three or five woodblock books proved that this place was indeed a library, making people sigh as they faced the plaque "Saiyilou" in the middle. The guide then took out a portrait of Fan Qin from among the many portraits to show the visitors. Mr. Wang, who was traveling with me, turned pale after looking at it and repeatedly instructed, "This is a treasure, please cherish it." But I think that if this historically valuable portrait is left piled in the dust of the ruined pavilion, it may disappear soon.</p>
<p>The decline and ruin of Tianyi Pavilion is the same as the fate of our country. Thinking of Fan Qin more than four hundred years ago, how hard he worked for the documents, just like our revolutionary martyrs of that year, how much they sacrificed for the construction of the country. It is only because there is no one to succeed them that not only have they failed to fulfill the responsibility of preserving and increasing them, but they have even destroyed and injured them, resulting in today's irreparable situation. Furthermore, if a place with historical and cultural value like Tianyi Pavilion were in another country, the government would definitely take care to protect and preserve it, and would never allow it to survive or perish on its own. Mr. Wang later suggested to Tao Xiaojie, the administrative inspector of eastern Zhejiang, that he should repair it slightly and purchase some ordinary books for the public to read. It is said that Tao has happily accepted it. I sincerely hope that when I revisit it in the future, Tianyi Pavilion will be able to restore its former appearance.</p>
<p>Since the price of paper has skyrocketed, it is often seen in newspapers that old books from various places are regarded as waste paper, sold by the catty, and transported to paper mills for the purpose of making recycled paper. This is a catastrophe for our country's culture, and eastern Zhejiang cannot escape this disaster. It is said that the price of old books in Ningbo is 45 yuan per catty. Someone bought 32 copies of Chen Yuanlong's "Gezhi Liaoyuan" for 210 yuan because it weighed five and a half catties. Hundreds of millions of catties of old books are bought.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Educational Situation</p>
<p>The educational situation in Ningbo is relatively satisfactory. There are three public and private middle schools, twenty-seven public complete elementary schools, fifty-three private ones, thirty-five public elementary schools, and two hundred and twenty private ones. Education expenses account for 23% of the total expenditure. Teachers' salaries are about 11 yuan per hour for high school, 8 yuan for junior high school, and 300 to 400 yuan per month for elementary school teachers. This is indeed a meager amount, but fortunately there is rice allocation and a rice-for-schooling program, which can be used to supplement it. In March of this year, each teacher can receive 5 dou of rice, priced at 60 yuan per dou, and 2.5 dou of rice for schooling, given free of charge. Originally, the primary and secondary schools in Yin County had a method of collecting rice for schooling, with high school students paying 1.5 dou per semester, elementary senior students 7 sheng, middle-grade students 6 sheng, and lower-grade students 5 sheng. The rice for schooling that teachers receive is allocated from this. However, the allocated rice has been reduced to 1.5 dou this month. This is because Ningbo is not a rice-producing area. There is a saying that Ningbo is familiar with three meals of porridge. Whenever there is a shortage of food, it is a very big problem to find a remedy. The market price of rice is around 2,600 yuan.</p>
<p>From Ningbo to Fenghua, there are still buses running daily, although there is only one bus a day, which is very convenient for travelers. The small car we took took less than 2 hours to get to Fenghua. The road is quite good and the scenery along the way is very beautiful. Fenghua was originally a peach-producing area. It was the peach blossom season, which was reflected in the golden rape flowers and the oily green beans and wheat. Together with the blue and clear water, it was really pleasant to be in it, and the scenery near Fenghua was especially good. However, the only downside is that there are tombs scattered in the rice fields along the way, and there are few trees on the mountains. On the one hand, it spoils the scenery, and on the other hand, it reduces production. If there were no graves in the fields, how much more rice and wheat could be produced in a year? If there were trees on the mountains, the price of wood and firewood today could be reduced. And this is not only the situation on the road from Yin to Fenghua. How many mountains in China are not covered with shrubs!</p>
<p>The county seat of Fenghua is very small, and the market is not as good as the nearby Daqiao Town. Education is quite developed. There is one junior high school and 118 elementary schools. As for teachers' treatment, in addition to a monthly salary of 400 to 500 yuan, they can get 200 catties of grain (about 1 dou of rice after milling) for 360 yuan. From this point of view, a Fenghua schoolteacher can feed his family without hunger, but there is no way to talk about anything else. It is also difficult to uniquely describe the hardship.</p>
<p>A Detour to Xikou</p>
<p>After leaving Fenghua, we detoured to Xikou. This is Chiang Kai-shek's birthplace, which has long been famous. The scenery is indeed not bad, and the construction is even more amazing. For example, the grandeur of the Wulin School buildings and the flatness of the road along Chiang's residence, "Suju," are enough to be a model for the whole of China.</p>
<p>A day later, we set off from Ningbo to Yuyao. There is also a bus that goes back and forth between Yuyao once a day. The road is the original route of the former railway and is still good. It passes through Cixi County. Yuyao is a county that produces eel, cotton, and rice. Material control is very strict, so people's livelihood is not a big problem. According to County Mayor Lao, soldiers, police, and county government officials in this county are allocated 3 dou of rice per month, priced at only 14 yuan per dou. Civil servants in affiliated agencies are allocated 3 dou, priced at 37.5 yuan per dou, people 2 dou, priced at 45 yuan per dou, and teachers 5 dou, priced the same as soldiers and police. When asked how he could do it so cheaply, he said that when he was herding grain in the countryside, the price was 15,000 yuan per 10,000 catties, which could mill 42 to 44 shi of rice. I asked if it would hurt the farmers, and he replied that part of the payment was in the form of affordable daily necessities such as soap and matches, so the farmers would not suffer.</p>
<p>The Current Situation Requires Diligent Governance</p>
<p>Based on the impressions I gained from my hasty trip, I feel that the situation in eastern Zhejiang today is generally not bad. It is now both after the war and during the war, and the rise in prices is unavoidable, as long as the unreasonable surge can be stopped. The most important issue to pay attention to is public security. Eastern Zhejiang is not entirely a peaceful area. There are still guerrillas and so-called "Three-Five Detachments" in remote areas. It is said that the people have fewer complaints against the Three-Five Detachments because they know how to win over the people. For example, they deliberately send a group of people to a village, deliberately break a bowl while eating in a restaurant, deliberately look panicked, and deliberately pay double the price of the bowl. This is a kind of trick, but why don't all the soldiers and police use this trick? There is now the 10th Army of the Army stationed in eastern Zhejiang, and there is a security team to defend it. In terms of strength, it should be above the guerrillas and the Three-Five Detachments. If they can be diligently trained and loyal to their responsibilities, it should not be difficult to make eastern Zhejiang an area where people can live and work in peace. I know that the military and political authorities in eastern Zhejiang today are working hard and are determined to make the nine counties of eastern Zhejiang a model peaceful area. I hope that they will continue to work hard and strive to the end.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has started collecting the first-class profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 32nd year in accordance with regulations on March 1 this year. Recently, companies, shops, factories, and banks have actively declared their profits and paid income tax in accordance with regulations. In order to prevent illegal merchants from evading taxes, the Bureau has decided to dispatch personnel to audit accounts and expedite collection. In the event of concealment or refusal to audit accounts, the taxable amount will be determined based on business conditions and penalties will be imposed.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Establishment of Wharf Service Center; Safeguarding the Safety of Merchants and Travelers; Minister Ding Delivers Speech <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wharf Service Center, which has been in preparation for more than half a year, has recently begun providing services. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government recently delivered a speech as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important port for trade between China and foreign countries. Domestic and foreign ships enter and leave frequently, and merchants and travelers come and go in an endless stream. However, the wharves of each port are often occupied by hooligans and gangsters who use coercion and extortion, fraud and deception. Merchants and travelers either lose money, lose luggage, are beaten and humiliated, or are exploited. Darkness abounds and crimes occur frequently. Most of the wharf coolies are ignorant people who are either used by them or collude with them to illegally profit, which is also very hateful. More than twenty years ago, when I came to Shanghai to study, I repeatedly encountered such illegal activities and often thought of ways to eliminate them to protect travelers. After the incident, the number of ships decreased and the number of passengers increased. As a result, the darkness of the wharves became more serious, and merchants and travelers were in dire straits and suffered even more. As the head of the Ministry of Social Welfare, I cannot sit idly by and watch this act that hinders public welfare and deepens the suffering of the people. In the past year, the China Social Work Association petitioned to set up a "Shanghai Wharf Service Center" in Shanghai, not for personal gain, but for social service. They also submitted a detailed plan, willing to do their best to relieve the suffering of merchants and travelers, which is in line with my long-cherished wish, so I resolutely approved it. The Ministry of Social Welfare requested the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to provide maintenance and sent separate letters to relevant parties to assist. They all agreed to do so, which shows that all parties sympathize with the elimination of corrupt forces, which is very gratifying. The wharf service center started preparations, which took half a year and cost millions of dollars before starting service a month ago. According to confidential reports, there are unscrupulous elements who are using the name to cause trouble. Their purpose is purely for personal gain, so they are willing to risk being unscrupulous, disrupt public security, and hinder public welfare. All circles must hate them deeply. It is my duty to sincerely safeguard public welfare. In addition to issuing warnings from the ministry and requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to take effective precautions, I hope that all circles will rise up and cooperate to eliminate the wharf villains and protect merchants and travelers.</p>

<p>Regarding the distribution of temporary allocation purchase certificates for cotton cloth, the Fourth Section of the Municipal Economic Bureau has already carried out population statistics in each district. In order to carefully review the accurate number of households in each district, people have been sent to the public offices in each district to review. It is learned that the Bureau is now preparing to notify the public offices in each district to send personnel to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to contact them to receive the cloth purchase certificates.</p>

It is now learned that Secretary Chen's resignation is very firm and he has submitted his resignation again. The authorities approved it yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Investigation and Registration of Ownerless Land and Houses to Be Conducted <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident, many owners in Shanghai have been affected and have moved elsewhere, resulting in no one to manage their own properties. In order to protect the rights and interests of the people, the municipal government will immediately begin an investigation and registration to protect property rights. The Shanghai North Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Owners Not in Residence is now managing the applications from owners, returning land and houses and rent matters. Owners who return to Shanghai can directly apply to the office at No. 27 Fusheng Road at the end of Laobazi Road in Hongkou to return the land and houses.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Thorough Cooperation Between China and Japan Will Surely Defeat the Enemy: Interview with Reporting Department Head Matsushima <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China held a routine reception for a Chinese journalists' delegation. Department Head Matsushima and Lieutenant Commander Ta discussed the current war situation in detail. The key points of Department Head Matsushima's report are summarized below:</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses on Outer Island Perimeters</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Navy's failed attempt to seize Palau Island last time, it has remained silent. This is likely an attempt to recover from that defeat. A Washington dispatch on the 12th stated: U.S. Combined Fleet Commander King, speaking before the House Budget Committee on the 12th, said: The Japanese Navy's strategy on the outer island perimeter is to lure the Allied forces to attack, then inflict heavy casualties. This is very valuable, but the Allied forces must break this Japanese strategy and then destroy the Japanese Empire. The so-called Japanese outer island perimeter includes the Kuril Islands, Wake Island, Oshima Island, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Dutch East Indies. The United States has already tasted failure in island-hopping warfare. Judging from King's remarks, the losses suffered by the U.S. in the past have been extremely heavy. Not only have ships and vessels been damaged, amounting to millions of tons, but human losses have also reached over a million. We often hear the U.S. side boasting about dropping a certain number of bombs on such and such island, but the result is probably not enough to compensate for even one ten-thousandth of the ships and personnel sacrificed.</p>
<p>Attrition Warfare and Annihilation Strategy</p>
<p>The Japanese military has an outer defense line and an inner defense line for operations. As Commander King said, the purpose of the outer defense line is to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, which we call attrition warfare. The task of the inner defense line is to annihilate the enemy's invading forces. The recent Battle of Palau Island is an example of the inner defense strategy; invading enemy forces are the best targets for destruction by the Japanese Navy. Using the European war situation as an analogy, there are similarities. In the German-Soviet war, Germany sent a large army deep into the Soviet Union. Once the pre-determined plan was successful, it shifted its target and retreated to its original position, which is attrition warfare. If Britain and the United States open a second front at this time, it would give Germany an excellent opportunity to annihilate the British and American forces. This point has the same significance as the current Pacific war situation.</p>
<p>India-Burma Operations Corroborate Each Other</p>
<p>The heroic achievements of the Japanese Army in India and Burma are the most significant corroboration of the Pacific naval operations. Due to the bravery of the Japanese Army, the fall of Imphal is imminent, and the cutting off of the Ledo Road is also inevitable. According to a Shonan dispatch on the 13th: According to reliable information, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Headquarters of Mountbatten in New Delhi has recently moved to Ceylon. From this, we can see the enemy's embarrassing situation. This move by the enemy anticipates the imminent fall of New Delhi and prepares to reopen a bloody path between the Indian Ocean and Burma. The eastern Pacific Ocean surface seems extremely quiet at present, while the western continent is extremely active. In this quiet situation, the Japanese Navy waits for the enemy to move; as soon as we discover the enemy, we will eliminate them, because the Japanese Navy is ready.</p>
<p>Using China to Attack Japan</p>
<p>We now ask all Chinese leaders to pay attention to one extremely important matter, that is, the recent widespread rumors about Wallace's visit to Chongqing. According to a Washington dispatch on the 12th: President Roosevelt sent Vice President Wallace as a formal representative to Chongqing to carry out activities to unite the generals in Chongqing under Chiang Kai-shek. This fully demonstrates the United States' active attempts to control and invade China. We recall that from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War until May of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the Japanese Navy occupied various outposts in the outer periphery of the Greater East Asia region. In August of the 32nd year of the Republic, the enemy began to attack the outer periphery, using all its strength to pressure Japan, but achieved nothing. Australia currently has no one to do farm work, which shows their lack of manpower. No matter how abundant the enemy's war equipment and ships are, their human resources have reached a stage where they cannot sustain it. Therefore, the enemy is thinking of using China to attack Japan, with the aim of using Chinese manpower as a sacrifice for the British and American offensive. This is the intention of Wallace's visit to Chongqing. From this, we can draw another conclusion, that the human resources of both China and Japan are currently feeling overwhelmed. Only if both sides cooperate thoroughly and work together can the final victory over the Anglo-American invading forces surely belong to our two countries, China and Japan. We hope that the Chinese leaders will give this matter careful consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Conservation Association Asks City Government to Advance Summer Time; Original Time to Be Advanced One More Hour <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Conservation Association, recently considering that it is summertime, in order to save coal and make more use of daylight for work, and hearing rumors of disguised activities in the South City gambling dens, submitted the matter for discussion at the fourth board meeting. A unanimous resolution was passed to suggest that the city government advance the original summer time by another hour, and to urge the authorities to pay attention to the stirring of gambling thugs. An official document was formally submitted to the city government on the 13th, and it is believed that the authorities will agree. The original text is excerpted below: (omitted above) In order to promote conservation work, in addition to implementing various measures successively, this association, recently recognizing the value of time and the arrival of summer, intends to advance the already implemented new time by another hour, using sunlight to shorten working hours under lamps, directly benefiting human health and indirectly helping to save electricity. In addition to this association actively advocating and promoting this, we propose that your office adopt and implement it in order to seek universal promotion.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Disguised Activities in Gambling Dens</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the closure of the South City gambling dens, there are rumors of disguised activities. Gambling is more harmful than floods and beasts, and it is the biggest obstacle to the construction of the new Shanghai. Fortunately, the South City gambling dens have now been ordered to be closed by your office, and all patriotic people are celebrating with joy, believing that this move is a precursor to the construction of Shanghai and the renovation of municipal administration. How can we allow the appearance of disguised gambling dens again? This association dares not remain silent on this matter. Therefore, we especially write to earnestly request your office to pay close attention, ensuring that the harm of gambling is eradicated, so that the country and society will both benefit, which is indeed deeply fortunate.

<p>Regarding the distribution of hukou rice for the 66th and 67th issues in this city's first district, it should have started in the latter half of last month, but as of now, there has been no news about delivery or sale. Ordinary citizens already feel that two sheng of rice per ten days is not enough to sustain them, and now it has been postponed repeatedly, so they urgently hope that the relevant authorities will urge its speedy implementation to alleviate the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Household Soap Outside District One to Be Distributed Early Next Month</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of household soap, which the citizens have been eagerly awaiting, the city's Economic Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with various manufacturers. As a result, the manufacturers are responsible for manufacturing, including brands such as Guben, Niu Pai, Arrow Knife, Nanyang, Taishan, Yuhua, Guanghua, Henry, Central, and Mingxing, as well as Changlin Hongxing, Jicheng, and others, totaling more than 3,000 boxes. According to reliable information, household soap in all districts of the city except District One will begin to be distributed in early next month.</p>

<h3 id="e39">The Future of Prices <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>"Suppressing prices to the level before January" is the resolution announced by the government authorities and the comfort received by the public. The question is whether the resolution can be carried out to the end and whether the comfort can last long. In reality, the authorities' work on suppressing prices, with the newly established Economic Security Office as its latest development, is indeed constantly working hard there. A large part of the prices of goods, except for the retail prices of many daily necessities, has indeed seen a considerable decline. However, these realities cannot absolutely guarantee the future of prices, because the agency for suppressing prices is there, but it remains to be seen whether its implementation methods are thorough; the trend of a slight decline in prices is there, but it remains to be seen whether there is a possibility of rising again in the future.</p>
<p>Whether prices will rise again in the future cannot, of course, be entirely entrusted to the efforts of the implementing agencies, because increasing production and smoothing the flow of materials are ultimately the basic problems of price policy. However, the "bottom of the cauldron" of rising prices must rely on implementing agencies such as the Economic Security Office to do the "drawing fuel" work. If you ask what these "fuels" are and how to draw them out, then there is probably too much to say. In short, the future problem lies in implementation. The method of implementation lies in how to use the banner of economic security to capture profiteering hoarders and speculating merchants in one fell swoop, so that they cannot continue to influence the future of prices.</p>

<p>More than 200 guilds in this city, including the Grain Industry, Coal Industry, Charcoal Industry, Hot Water Industry, Noodle Manufacturing Industry, Wood Industry, Hardware Industry, Construction Industry, Glass Industry, Leather Industry, Seasoning Industry, North-South Goods Industry, Clerical Industry, Cigarette Industry, Department Store Industry, Knitting Industry, Silk Industry, Clothing Industry, and Electrical Industry, in order to receive instructions from the Economic and Food Bureaus to strictly supervise members' trading, hereby notify their respective member companies:</p>
<p>"The Economic Bureau (Food Bureau) instructs: It is found that trade associations are important grassroots organizations for controlling the economy and are closely related to the implementation of wartime economic policies. Each industry association should strictly supervise its members without any leniency. If any member is found to be engaged in illegal trading, their membership qualification should be revoked, and the competent authority should be reported to investigate and deal with them according to law in order to maintain discipline. If they dare to conceal and fail to report, once discovered by the local competent authorities, the persons in charge of the relevant associations should also be punished according to the severity of the circumstances." All our members must abide by this and not violate it. If anyone is found to be engaged in illegal trading, no leniency will be shown, and the authorities will be immediately reported for investigation. We hope everyone pays attention.</p>

<h3 id="e43">A Visit to Lu Jia Yi School and Its Affiliated Nursery <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Tender green grass, newly opened rapeseed flowers, a scene of rural scenery. This is exactly the area near Lu Jia Road at the end of Route Lufée, which is also the location of Lu Jia Yi School and its affiliated nursery.</p>
<p>Pushing open the gate of the campus, a row of bungalows immediately came into view! In the reception room, there were three children sitting head-to-head, pointing and pointing excitedly at the pictures. Hearing someone coming in, they all raised their heads and looked at me with curious eyes. Later, a young female teacher came out, greeted me, and explained that today is Children's Day, and the teachers and students have all gone to Longhua to have fun.</p>
<p>Starting from Scratch Empty-Handed</p>
<p>She accompanied me to visit the classrooms. The equipment was okay. The walls displayed the achievements of large and small calligraphy compositions, as well as many maxims, warnings, precepts and pictures. It is said that this school was founded jointly by seven or eight high school students and college students, relying only on a cavity of enthusiasm, a red heart, a small mouth and a pair of empty hands. They had no money and no backing. They just started a charity school from scratch empty-handed! Later, due to urgent need, they added a nursery, which has been open for nearly two years and currently has more than 240 students. From the first grade to the sixth grade, they are divided into three groups: high, middle, and low. Most of the students are children of poor residents nearby, so the tuition is very low, and the salaries of the teachers and staff are also very meager - from 200 yuan to 400 yuan, which is almost equivalent to pure volunteer work, but most of them are provided with food and accommodation. I also visited their campus and vegetable garden, which were full of greenery. There were trees planted by the students in the group, and the garden was planted with various vegetables. The rapeseed flowers were emitting a fragrance. This is to allow children from civilian backgrounds to practice planting, picking, and tasting by themselves. Who says there is no profound meaning in this?</p>
<p>The Blessed Land of the Nursery</p>
<p>Bypassing a large open field, we arrived at the old site of the Wang Family Ancestral Hall. This place is borrowed as the blessed land of the nursery. The houses are fairly large, and Miss Xue, the principal of the charity school, came out to greet us. It is said that due to insufficient funding, the nursery only accommodates 20 children, whose parents are mostly rice merchants, female workers, or vegetable growers. The purpose of opening the nursery is purely for service (only a small amount of food and accommodation expenses are charged). The monthly expenses for both the charity school and the nursery total 40,000 yuan. She explained very frankly: the school is poor; the nursery is of course even poorer. The teachers and staff are also capable but have no money. Funding is often stretched and always running a deficit, trapped in a situation of "a clever woman cannot cook without rice." In addition to fundraising, part of the funding also relies on donations from groups or individuals who come to visit, so they welcome and look forward to external visits, criticisms and guidance, so that they can improve. They also hope that all sectors of society will work together to help.</p>
<p>Speaking of their actual difficulties, money is certainly the most lacking; rice and coal are also big problems. Other items needed in the nursery, such as bowls, bedding, beds, tables, and chairs, are also very much needed. Books and medicines are also welcome.</p>
<p>Blessing the Children</p>
<p>Finally, surrounded by a group of innocent and lively children; in the sounds of "Hello, teacher! Hello, teacher!" which rose and fell, and I could hardly respond to all of them, I was sent off and embarked on my return journey, silently blessing these lovely children in my heart!</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Shark (2)</p>
<p>After watching the night scene in Ginza and returning to the ship, in the cadet room, there was a lot of discussion about the customs of Tokyo. This had long become yesterday's dream.</p>
<p>Before the order for departure preparations was issued, the cadets waited eagerly for the order with new dreams and a sense of tension. However, this day finally arrived.</p>
<p>On October 5, Showa 14, the training fleet embarked on a long voyage amid the sky-high sound of bugles. Because it was slightly cloudy, the waves did not show their obvious posture. The harbor tugboats sending off the guests were full of flower-like colors. It turned out to be the relatives and lovers of officers and cadets from the vicinity of Tokyo, wearing gorgeous attire to send them off.</p>
<p>"Wish you a safe journey!" There were also very brave young ladies who shouted out a voice louder than the siren, waving their handkerchiefs at their loved ones.</p>
<p>Soon after, although the tugboats returned, the cadets on the deck still could not release their salutes. This was because many warships inside were holding embarkation ceremonies to send them off.</p>
<p>"Wishing you a smooth sailing!"</p>
<p>"Thank you for your kind hospitality!"</p>
<p>Such signals were exchanged.</p>
<p>However, the send-off was not limited to this. In the sky, the planes were also waving their wings, holding a send-off. In addition, three destroyers and two torpedo boats had been sent all the way to Kannonzaki.</p>
<p>Not all fleet departures can receive such a warm send-off. Those who receive such a send-off, in addition to fleets with special missions, are only the training fleet when it departs. From this, one can also know how much enthusiasm and expectation is placed on the training fleet.</p>
<p>The ship was full of a new lively atmosphere. In particular, the faces of the cadets were beaming with joy. This voyage was something they had long been eagerly awaiting. It was a dangerous journey to foreign countries and the South Seas, such as Honolulu, Hilo, Route, Ponape, Truk, and the Palau Islands. Moreover, it was a Pacific voyage where good and bad fortune could change at any time. This ocean, for the young cadets, could not be said to be a dreamlike yearning.</p>
<p>Although inland navigation is also a part of the Pacific Ocean, for the real people and others, only this time did they feel that this was the real Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>This time, the Iwate, on which the real people were riding, had become the flagship. The commander's flag was flying on the mast. Thus, the warship Iwate sailed eastward, riding the wind and breaking the waves. The land gradually sank. In an instant, it disappeared below the horizon.</p>
<p>"If the weather is good, you can still see Mount Fuji."</p>
<p>The officer standing on the deck told the real people this.</p>
<p>It was already close to dusk. Looking out at a glance, everywhere was a vast ocean. At this time, the surging waves</p>
<p>(This is the Pacific Ocean!)</p>
<p>The real people affirmed this.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Frugal Soup and Cake Banquet to Help Refugee Children and Orphans <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Bao, the father-in-law of Jin Chang, is engaged in the fishing business and is enthusiastic about public welfare. Last winter, he had a grandson named Shi Yu. On the occasion of the first month after his birth, a soup and cake banquet should have been held. Due to the extraordinary times, the Zhu family specially used 2,000 yuan of the banquet fee to prepare for helping good deeds. Recently, I learned that this newspaper launched a campaign to rescue suffering children, so I entrusted this fee to this newspaper to forward it to ten refugee children's groups. This man's enthusiasm for public welfare is an example for all sectors of society.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Enrollment in the Document Special Training Class is Extremely Enthusiastic <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the Document Special Training Class organized by this office, the number of people who have requested brochures and registered has been very enthusiastic. It is now set that the registration deadline is the 20th of this month. Those who have registered should send the registration form directly to the Social Service Department of this newspaper within the deadline. Those who pass the test will officially start classes. The class time is set from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Fundraising for the China Children's Relief Association is Going Smoothly <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The China Children's Relief Association's campaign to raise funds for the education and upbringing of refugee children is progressing smoothly. As of yesterday, a total of 1,352,182 yuan has been received from all sectors of society. Among the most recent donations, there are: Mrs. Yang Pengnian's fundraising of 72,900 yuan, Qi Huichang 66,000 yuan, Wang Renfu 25,000 yuan, Hua Xuewu 18,000 yuan, Zhao Jinqing 15,000 yuan, Dai Xiaoti 14,000 yuan, Tao Shanzhong 12,000 yuan, Lin Kanghou, Wang Liangcheng, Mrs. Gao Jinglang, and Liu Jujingtang each 10,000 yuan. However, the association is still 650,000 yuan short of its fundraising goal. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to help raise funds and create blessings for refugee children.</p>
