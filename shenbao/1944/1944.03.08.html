<h3>非常措置</h3>
<p>日本自最近確定國內態勢强化方策之後，於二月二十五日政府向閣議提出非常措置要綱十五條，經首相陳述旨趣及責施方誤後即行决定，並着手起草各項具體辦法。同月二十九日公布已擬定成案者五件，復於三月三日閣議通過具體要綱三項（以上各節分見二月二十六日三月上日及四日本報所載東京中央社電）。於此可見：</p>
<p>日本政府體念目前時代之偉大以及戰事後果之宏遠，而深感國內態勢有强化之必要。故於非常措置要網提出之後一星期內，連續於閣議中通過若干具體方案，隨即分別實施。此種劍及屨及坐而言起而行之精神，値行吾人欽佩與效慕。尤其在此非常時期，決非會而不議議而不決決而不行之態度，泄泄　　，敷衍門面，而能收事實上之效果。</p>

<p>日本以全副精神，對直接貢獻於增强戰力之一切國內施策與體制，全面予以有積極性之刷新與改善，以今年為「精進之一年」，而完遂其決戰政策。與日本處於同一地域之我國，當有所警惕而善自處之！自處之道維何？曰：「從一切革新入手」！</p>

<h3>滬段長職　送法院究辦</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　建設部前接密報，以關警上海段施前段長服實，有種種不法為，特派幹員赴滬分頭密查，旋據查復，確有侵佔及敲詐證據，陳部長大為震怒，即　路政署傳施前段長來部詢問，該員對於在段長任內盜賣並擅自處分查獲統制物品如米及棉布等為數甚夥，並敲詐旅客所機帶非統制物品多種等事實，均已承認一諱，建設部於昨日依服公務人員犯贓治罪條例之規定，備文將該員以路警管理處處長李軍鐸對部屬失察，事前未加檢舉，有虧職守，亦先予撤職。至應如何處分，因尙有他案，正併倂呈院核示中。</p>
<h3>平津各報　縮減篇幅</h3>
<p>北平七目中央社電　北平市新聞事業自事變以來，已有數度變選，最近當局以值茲參戰體制之下，為節約用紙起見，特規定自三月一日起，平市新民報改為每日發行四開小型，天津各報亦與新民報同樣發行四開一張，平市民衆報與實彬同改八開，但都價仍然照舊。</p>

<h3>歐洲空戰的新階段</h3>
<p>最近「歐洲的空襲的對德空襲，本來始終祗是乘黑夜及惡劣氣候作無區別的盲爆；但最近則大舉出動戰鬥機，與德國的識鬥機隊作正面格鬥，一面並在白晝對德國飛機工廠作正確的轟炸。反軸心方面開始進入這新階段的特徽，即因為當共對德空襲時，被德戰門機邀舉而受的損失，日趨增加。</p>
<p>反軸心空軍的對德空襲。在二月二十日的空襲中。出動飛機六百架，而喪失者有七十九架，達百分之十以上，此在反軸心方面實屬得不償失。尤其在最近的斯以多伽爾特，萊布齊，謬恩亨，。西歐等地的空襲中，反軸心軍所喪失的大型轟炸機，合計已達五千架。</p>
<p>這種損失數的增大，乃因德方最近召回出動於東部戰錢，義大利戰綫的戰鬥機之部，以防衛總國本土，對來襲的反軸心轟炸機，課以浩重的「通行稅一，使反軸心方面不能不增加職鬥機以護衛轟炸機。反軸心方面乃企圖毀壞德國生產戰鬥機的飛機製造工廠，此之為免除道，通行稅」的最有効的方法。</p>
<p>一從歐洲空中　除德機。」</p>
<p>但　　空軍　已推知反軸心方面的這種空襲企圖，最近乃開始大規模的空襲倫敦，使大部份反軸心戰鬥機為防衛倫敦而紊制於英國本土，妨害戰鬥機參加空襲德國。又德方深悉反軸心方面對德國轟炸機的探測組織非常發達，　以等敵機轟炸德本土時，同時空襲倫敦，鍛近的倫敦空襲機，普通均在反軸心機從　國本土歸還時，同時飛臨目標物的上空，使英方的聽音監視網陷於混亂，而乘隙製擊。</p>
<p>因此。反軸心方面不容易獲悉來襲的德轟炸機，英方的企圖，擬在白晝轟炸，而欲使德塵陷於毀滅狀態，獲得制空權，以之為「歐洲統一作戰」的基礎。但因德空軍的猛烈反攻，使英方的企圖歸於失敗，而永久葬送了反軸心軍的侵入歐洲計劃。（翔：譯自二月二十五日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<p>德機大舉轟炸倫敦</p>
<p>德空軍於二月二十二日夜轟炸倫敦，就其參加機數及激烈情形而言。為一九四〇年秋以來之鍛大轟炸。德軍當局於廿三日會見外國記者國時稱：</p>
<p>此次轟炸中參加機數之衆，在倫敦轟炸中實為僅見。然此次「大轟炸損失極為輕微，顧堪注目。穗空軍在此次轟炸倫敦中使用新式燒夷彈，而確證其威力偉大。</p>
<p>據德方情報，德國空軍於二十二日夕刻以大隊飛機數百攻擊倫數，全市蒙極大損害。尤以該市東南部諸區域最甚，隨地發生大火災。據懲軍當局聲稱，上述轟炸效果。乃因德轟炸機隊採用新嚴術所致。一第二次對英戰　；因此次轟炸而又將大規模展開。（翔：譯自二月二十五日東京謂賣報知）</p>
<h3>鳥克蘭前綫　惡戰進行中　北路蘇軍一隊被圍</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　蘇軍蘇柯夫元帥應下第一烏克關戰綫軍，四日已你（基輔西方百七十英里之希佩托夫加。至基輔西南方波羅斯枓洛夫（Pros　uorv）之大戰錢上展開大攻勢。六日德軍省局競明戰現如次：希佩托夫加西方及波羅斯科洛夫北方之廣大戰綫上之蘇軍，五日仍繼續作大規模攻勢，激戰數小時後，德軍向南方後退約十公里。蓋是役德軍僅以擲彈兵一師團，與蘇軍職車二師團以上應戰，故激戰甚久後，終於後退。但德軍竟乘機切斷蘇戰車部隊與步兵部隊之聯絡，蘇步兵部隊隨即作反攻，謀恢復聯絡，但迄未成功，而遭受　德軍集中砲火之攻擊。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德軍當局發表：北部戰事重點，五日集中於浦斯科夫。那爾瓦兩市，浦斯科夫區蘇軍曾以數部隊。擬由東南及東北突入該市，經德軍將其擊退。那爾瓦區蘇軍雖行反農攻擊，但因德軍砲火對其集中發射，未得前進。德軍於二日前即對德軍包團下之蘇軍有力部隊，電行殲滅作戰，逐漸縮小包圍圈。</p>
<p>南路鐵路綫戰略所必爭</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電據海通社訊，蘇軍冬季攻勢之末次攻勢，已於日前開始，其初步目標，在突南路獻棧，以開關落馬尼亞之進軍道路，蘇軍雖有進展，然距離目猶遠，南路之　濘李並未能妨碍德機械部隊之行軍，芷如一九四一至一九四二年冬季之嚴寒，亦未能影響德軍之作戰。現所成問題者，即為敵軍之給養問題　猶憶在一年以前，據軍孟斯坦上將即曾利用敵方之困難時期，而突入卡柯夫蘇軍陣地之側面，卒將該城克復，南路地勢特殊，雙方之交通問題蘇軍之同時自三點進攻，原因亦即在此。蘇軍於　五在希佩托夫加發動攻勢，以基輔鐵路為供應綫，二十四小時後，又自齊文尼哥洛加區出發前進，蘇將伐社丁將軍不九以前曾在該處作戰不利未能防止德軍術出契　喀賽以西少包圍袋。齊文尼哥洛洛加必有之現象，但德後備單一時猶未必能抵達。至於若日前猛烈，敵突破計　未見成功。</p>
<h3>柏林近郊高空　發生大空戰　擊落美機架</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電海通社訊，昨夜最後消息：美機昨日襲柏林被擊落一百零八架。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社重據軍界息：大隊美機昨最長入德國，經德戰鬥攔襲，發生空前大激戰，戰區遍及整個德西北部中部，而以楚德海與柏附近之哈凡爾湖間最為烈。柏林於下午一時即發空製警報，德戰鬥機及高射砲迫使敵機時時改變航程，當敵機飛抵柏林折郊時，被擊落者已不少。來襲敵機雖多，然均被衝散，不能集中轟炸，無何效未遭損害，此次空襲實柏林所遭歷次空襲中之最不重要者。保護美轟炸機之大批戰鬥機飛行極高，有高至萬公尺以上者，故德機亦必須昇入高空與之迎戰，柏林四週之空戰大多在八千公尺之空中進行，時天空雖有襲層，但仍可見敵機之　下。</p>

<h3>British Stronghold Enemy Positions Heavily Shelled, Japanese Army in Burma Achieves Significant Victories</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front states that the Japanese army's annihilation of the main force of the British 7th Division in the Sinzwea Basin on the Indo-Burmese front has broken past victory records, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. Furthermore, the Japanese suicide squad on the same front, in this campaign, crossed the Donbaik pass from the Tunnels, passed over the Mayu Mountains, and launched a long-range assault on Nagakyun, destroying fifteen field guns, twenty-one cannons, six anti-aircraft guns, sixty-nine mortars and continuous firing guns, two thousand nine hundred and fifty machine guns, fifty tanks, eight hundred and twenty vehicles, sinking seventeen boats and shooting down sixty-two enemy aircraft.</p>

<h3>Air Battle Over Rabaul</h3>

<h3>Director-General of the Central China Revitalization Association, Takashima, Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, in order to assist in the completion of China's economic construction work, allied nations have begun to make further adjustments to various national policy companies jointly operated by China and Japan after the incident. The first adjustments to be implemented include the dissolution of the Central China Silk Company and the reorganization of the Central China Salt Industry Company. The adjustment work of these two major companies has been largely completed. The adjustment matters of other companies have also reached a concrete stage after repeated and careful consultations by relevant parties. Therefore, Mr. Takashima, Director-General of the Japanese Central China Revitalization Association, came to Nanjing from Shanghai a few days ago to negotiate the details of the adjustment with the National Government authorities. It is expected that the second adjustment of the Sino-Japanese joint national policy companies will be realized in the near future, which will make a great contribution to the future of the National Government's economic construction.</p>

<h3>Japanese Embassy Commends Outstanding Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The authorities of the Japanese Embassy in China previously commended eight Japanese residents in China who had devoted themselves to Sino-Japanese friendship on Japan's National Foundation Day this year. Now, after stricter selection, the following eleven Japanese residents and two organizations, for their dedication to promoting friendship and cooperation between the two countries, which is worthy of commendation, are awarded commendation certificates separately: Professor Hoshino Hideki of Shanghai teaches Japanese to Chinese people, contributing to the cultivation of Japanese-speaking talents; Tonoumi Sadame of Shanghai has worked hard to communicate between China and Japan, practicing the spirit of good neighborliness, with great achievements; Yamagishi Takako of Shanghai has devoted herself to Chinese women's education; Matsui Zetsugan of Zhangjiakou has educated and nurtured poor Chinese people, assisted in reclaiming rice paddies, and established a Japanese language school to educate Chinese people in Japanese; Shiinaga Akiko of Zhangjiakou has dedicated herself to educating Chinese people in Japanese and pacifying the people; the Jiangbei Xingye Company of Nantong has worked hard to revitalize the economy of North China and operate various businesses, contributing greatly to the practice of good neighborliness; the Tianqiao Yulin Pavilion in Beijing has implemented relief work, inspiring all staff to engage in good neighborliness; Misawa Katsura of Beijing has established the Beijing Kosei Medical Clinic, contributing to the popularization of rural medical care; Ms. Shimizu of Beijing runs the private Chongzhen Girls' School, assisting Shimizu Anzo in community work.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Measures</h3>
<p>Since Japan recently determined measures to strengthen the domestic situation, the government submitted a fifteen-article outline of extraordinary measures to the cabinet meeting on February 25. After the Prime Minister stated the purpose and implementation methods, it was immediately decided and began to draft various concrete measures. On February 29, five completed cases were announced, and on March 3, the cabinet meeting approved three specific outlines (the above sections can be found in the Central News Agency telegrams from Tokyo published in this newspaper on February 26, March 1, and 4). From this, it can be seen:</p>
<p>The Japanese government, mindful of the greatness of the current era and the far-reaching consequences of the war, deeply feels the necessity of strengthening the domestic situation. Therefore, within a week after the outline of extraordinary measures was proposed, several concrete plans were continuously passed in the cabinet meeting and implemented separately. This spirit of acting decisively and moving from words to deeds is worthy of our admiration and emulation. Especially in this extraordinary period, an attitude of meeting without discussing, discussing without deciding, and deciding without acting, or being perfunctory and putting on a show, cannot achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, and 13 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on increasing production and reducing consumption. From elementary school children onward, a simple life is encouraged, and all high-end restaurants, cafes, and geisha houses are closed down, all of which enable the national population to cultivate perseverance and develop a sense of transcending peacetime. In addition, the full utilization of land, the expansion of the scope of prohibited manufacturing items, the standardization of item types, the active utilization of preserved materials, and the saving of resources can improve the efficiency of the use of inherent resources and promote the production of materials to consolidate the material conditions necessary for modern warfare.</p>
<p>Articles 8 and 9 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on the flexibility of maritime transport. The shortening of sailing days, the increase of handling capacity in major ports by 50%, and the encouragement of the morale of crew members all enable the rapid flow of materials and fulfill the mission of mutual communication and corresponding supply and demand.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the outline of extraordinary measures focuses on the safety of residents in the rear. The strengthening of the air defense system and the promotion of general evacuation enable densely populated areas to prepare for the worst and avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>The realization of all plans and ideas depends on the power of politics, and the speed of their realization is judged by the size of political efficiency. Therefore, Articles 10, 11, 12, and 14 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on the rapid handling of urgent matters and the simplification of administrative procedures.</p>
<p>Japan, with all its spirit, is giving full and positive renewal and improvement to all domestic policies and systems that directly contribute to enhancing combat power, making this year "the year of diligence" to complete its decisive battle policy. Our country, which is in the same region as Japan, should be vigilant and take good care of itself! What is the way to take care of oneself? It is: "Start with all innovations"!</p>
<h3>Southern Military and Political Regions Urgently Seek Resource War Potential</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in the South, the conference of the heads of general affairs departments of the military and political regions of Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java was held on the 3rd and 4th, deciding that the Japanese Southern Army's administrative policy for the 19th year of Showa is to cooperate with the combat units to rapidly transform the resources of the occupied territories in the South into war potential, paying particular attention to the enhancement of transportation capacity, the construction of wooden ships, and the local self-sufficiency of major materials. Regarding the self-sufficiency of food on the ground, needless to say, efforts will be made to increase the production of coal, iron ore, soil, oil, cement, etc. In terms of iron production, in addition to increasing small smelting furnaces, small smelting furnaces of 15 to 20 tons will be rushed. For cement, easily replaceable substitute cement will be produced in various places.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Tightens Lending, Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the money supply in Nanjing and Shanghai has been extremely tight, and the head offices of various banks have been quite short of funds. As a result, I visited the financial authorities to inquire about the truth. According to them, the recent suspension of interbank lending by the Central Reserve Bank has caused speculators who use bank funds to hoard goods to be unable to circulate their funds. Therefore, they have released domestic goods, which has had a significant effect on suppressing prices. In order to implement the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the authorities will continue to adopt effective measures. After the Central Reserve Bank tightens lending, the government's financial and monetary policies will become more consolidated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Section Chief Case Sent to Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction previously received a secret report stating that Shi Fu, the former section chief of the Shanghai section of the Guan Police, had committed various illegal acts. Special investigators were sent to Shanghai to investigate separately and secretly. According to the investigation, there was indeed evidence of embezzlement and extortion. Minister Chen was greatly angered and immediately ordered the Department of Roads and Administration to summon Shi, the former section chief, to the ministry for questioning. The official admitted that during his tenure as section chief, he had stolen, sold, and arbitrarily disposed of a large number of controlled goods such as rice and cotton cloth, and extorted various non-controlled goods from passengers. The Ministry of Construction yesterday prepared a document in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Public Officials for Embezzlement and sent the official to the court for investigation. Li Junduo, the director of the Road Police Administration Office, was dismissed for failing to supervise his subordinates and failing to report them in advance, dereliction of duty. As for how to deal with it, because there are other cases, it is being submitted to the Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Beijing and Tianjin Newspapers Reduce Page Count</h3>
<p>Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - The newspaper industry in Beiping has undergone several changes since the incident. Recently, the authorities, in view of the current wartime system, and in order to save paper, stipulated that from March 1, the Beiping Xinmin Bao will be changed to a small four-page daily publication, and the Tianjin newspapers will also issue four-page editions like the Xinmin Bao. The Beiping Citizens' Daily and Shishi Bao will both be changed to eight-page editions, but the price will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Students in Beiping Demand Ban on Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - The youth students of Beiping police against juvenile students anti-drug prohibition, anti-gambling campaign, and hit in the decisive battle period in order to launch the national self-self-elimination of extravagance and luxury, on the eve of a special election representatives to the Bureau please require banning dance halls, Mayor Liu on this matter to rest, as for the fundamental elimination of measures, pending detailed study before announcing the implementation.</p>
<h3>Manchuria and North China Negotiate Material Trade</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Manchuria and North China Negotiating Bureau in order to establish each other's trade plan for this year, was held in two o'clock in the afternoon on the 7th of Manchuria and North China Trade Agreement, first by the Manchurian State Guhai Secretariat Deputy Minister made a speech, namely separate meeting of Manchuria's import materials discussion meeting, and the Financial Subcommittee meeting held to reach an agreement, the Manchurian State import materials discussion meeting, during which in addition to reviewing last year's results, more in this year's expectations are ore and coal as the center, to review this year's plan for the number and transport issues, and the Financial Subcommittee export materials mobilization materials discussion, the last session was held to coordinate overall issues.</p>
<h3>A New Phase in European Air Warfare</h3>
<p>Recently, "European air raids against Germany, which originally always consisted of indiscriminate blind bombing at night and in bad weather; but recently, fighter planes have been dispatched on a large scale to engage in direct combat with German fighter squadrons, while accurately bombing German aircraft factories during the day. The distinctive feature of the anti-Axis side entering this new phase is that the losses suffered when the Axis air raids on Germany are intercepted by German fighters are increasing daily.</p>
<p>In the anti-Axis air raid on Germany on February 20, 600 aircraft were dispatched, and 79 were lost, reaching more than 10%. This is really not worth the loss on the anti-Axis side. Especially in the recent air raids on Stuttgart, Leipzig, Munich, and Western Europe, the anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 5,000 large bombers.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of these losses is due to the fact that the German side recently recalled some of the fighter planes that were dispatched to the Eastern Front and the Italian Front to defend the mainland, imposing a heavy "transit tax" on the invading anti-Axis bombers, making it impossible for the anti-Axis side not to increase the number of fighter planes to protect the bombers. The anti-Axis side is attempting to destroy the aircraft manufacturing plants in Germany that produce fighter planes, which is the most effective way to avoid the transit tax.</p>
<p>One way to remove German aircraft from European skies."</p>
<p>However, the air force has already figured out this air raid attempt by the anti-Axis side, and recently began a large-scale air raid on London, causing most of the anti-Axis fighter planes to be disrupted and controlled in the UK mainland to defend London, hindering the fighter planes from participating in the air raid on Germany. In addition, the German side knows very well that the anti-Axis side has a very developed detection organization for German bombers, and when the enemy planes bomb the German mainland, they also air raid London at the same time. The recent London air raid planes usually fly over the target area at the same time when the anti-Axis planes return from the German mainland, causing the British sound monitoring network to fall into confusion and taking the opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not easy for the anti-Axis side to find out about the invading German bombers. The British plan is to bomb during the day and put Germany in a state of destruction, to gain air supremacy, and to use it as the basis for the "European Unified Operation". However, due to the fierce counterattack of the German Air Force, the British plan failed, and the anti-Axis forces' plan to invade Europe was permanently buried.

<p>German Aircraft Bomb London in Force</p>
<p>The German Air Force bombed London on the night of February 22. In terms of the number of participating aircraft and the intensity of the situation, it was the largest bombing since the autumn of 1940. The German military authorities said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 23rd:</p>
<p>The number of aircraft participating in this bombing is the largest ever seen in the bombing of London. However, the losses from this "massive bombing were extremely light, which is noteworthy. The Su Air Force used new incendiary bombs in this bombing of London and confirmed its great power.</p>
<p>According to German intelligence, the German Air Force attacked London with hundreds of aircraft in the evening of February 22, causing great damage to the entire city. The southeastern areas of the city were the worst hit, with large fires breaking out everywhere. According to the military authorities, the above-mentioned bombing effect was due to the German bomber squadron using a new strict technique. A second war against England will therefore be launched on a large scale as a result of this bombing. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi on February 25)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Ukrainian Front, A Soviet Army Unit in the Northern Route Surrounded</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Army responded to the First Ukrainian Front Army, which had launched a major offensive on the great battlefield from Hrypetovka, 170 miles west of Kyiv, to Proskurov, southwest of Kyiv on the 4th. On the 6th, the German army revealed the current situation of the war as follows: The Soviet army on the vast battle line west of Shepetivka and north of Proskurov continued to launch a large-scale offensive on the 5th. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army retreated about ten kilometers to the south. Because the German army only used a grenadier division to fight against more than two Soviet tank divisions in this battle, it finally retreated after a long period of fierce fighting. However, the German army took the opportunity to cut off the connection between the Soviet tank units and the infantry units. The Soviet infantry units immediately counterattacked to restore the connection, but failed and suffered concentrated artillery fire from the German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced that the focus of the northern war on the 5th was concentrated on the two cities of Pskov and Narva. The Soviet army in the Pskov area attempted to break into the city from the southeast and northeast with several units, but was repelled by the German army. Although the Soviet army in the Narva area launched a counter-agricultural attack, it failed to advance because the German artillery fire was concentrated on it. Two days ago, the German army had already carried out annihilation operations against the powerful Soviet units under the German encirclement, gradually shrinking the encirclement.</p>
<p>The Southern Railway Line is Strategically Contested</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Maritime News Agency, the last offensive of the Soviet army's winter offensive has begun a few days ago. Its initial goal is to break through the southern route stack to open the road to invade Romania. Although the Soviet army has made progress, it is still far from its goal. The marshy land in the south has not hindered the march of the German mechanized units, and the severe cold of the winter of 1941 to 1942 has not affected the German army's operations. The problem now is the enemy's supply problem. I still remember that a year ago, General Mengstein used the enemy's difficult period to break into the side of the Soviet army's position in Kharkiv, and finally recovered the city. The terrain of the southern road is special, and the communication problem between the two sides is the reason why the Soviet army attacked from three points at the same time. The Soviet army launched an offensive in Shepetivka on the 5th, using the Kyiv railway as a supply line. Twenty-four hours later, it set off and advanced from the Zvenigorodka area. General Veshatin failed to prevent the German army from exiting to the west of Kasey's small encirclement bag. The phenomena that Zvenigorodka must have, but the German reserve unit may not be able to arrive at the time. As for the fierce breakthrough plan, it has not been successful.</p>
<h3>Major Air Battle Occurs in the Suburbs of Berlin, Several American Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News Agency reported that the latest news last night was that 108 American aircraft were shot down yesterday in the raid on Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to military sources, a large number of American aircraft entered Germany yesterday and were intercepted by German fighters, resulting in an unprecedented fierce battle. The battle zone covered the entire northwest and central Germany, with the most intense fighting between the Zuiderzee and Lake Havel near Berlin. The air raid alarm was issued in Berlin at 1:00 PM. German fighters and anti-aircraft guns forced the enemy aircraft to change course from time to time. When the enemy aircraft flew to the suburbs of Berlin, many had already been shot down. Although there were many enemy aircraft, they were scattered and could not concentrate their bombing, and no damage was caused. This air raid was the least important of all the air raids Berlin has experienced. The large number of fighters protecting the American bombers flew very high, some as high as 10,000 meters or more, so German aircraft had to ascend to high altitudes to engage them. Most of the air battles around Berlin took place at an altitude of 8,000 meters. Although there was a haze in the sky at times, the shadows of the enemy aircraft could still be seen.</p>
<h3>Turkey Refuses to Join the War, British Military Delegation Returns Home</h3>
<p>Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - A United Press reporter in Cairo reported that the Turkish government had frankly refused to join the war before a large number of military supplies had been completely delivered and had given the anti-Axis powers a base. The transportation and preparation of use of this military supplies takes a fruit moon, The British military delegation has encountered a lot of political difficulties and has recently left the country empty-handed. The Turkish General Staff refused to adopt the British estimate of the forces that the German army could use against Turkey. News of the communication pointed out that in the possible air war, Turkey's estimate of Germany's strength was ten times higher than that of the British intelligence officers. At the same time, according to London news, Turkey will soon send a delegation to London to negotiate the resumption of military supplies to Turkey.</p>
<p>Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News reported that after the recent deterioration of British-Turkish relations, 400 British people will soon leave the Turkish capital, most of whom are advisors, experts, technicians, and engineering decorations working in Turkey as stipulated in the British-Turkish agreement.</p>
<h3>Rice Control Association Holds Symposium with Purchasing Merchants from Various Regions Yesterday: Report on Implementation Measures for Exchange of Purchased Goods</h3>
<p>To ensure smoother progress in future procurement operations and to provide guidance on the purchasing policies for purchasing merchants, the Rice Control Association held a symposium yesterday at 2:00 PM in the Li Chay Hotel, second floor, gathering all preparatory committee members from both Area A and Area B purchasing industries. The attendees included Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Vice Chairmen Guangye Junyi and Chen Guoquan, Committee Member Ueda Kenjiro, Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu, Deputy Secretary-General Yang Rong, heads of various departments, and over 150 preparatory committee members from Areas A and B purchasing industries. Tang Wenhua served as the master of ceremonies, Jin Zhan and Zhou Jiru recorded the minutes. After the formal greetings, Chairman Yuan delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches from Military Representative Staff Officer Inoue, Captain Anan, Counselor Okazaki from the Embassy, and Committee Member Ueda, all delivering earnest and encouraging words. Secretary-General Zhou then reported on the implementation measures for the exchange of purchased goods, after which the meeting adjourned. The following is the original text of Chairman Yuan's instructions: Since the establishment of this association, in the past five months, thanks to everyone's efforts in their respective roles, we have achieved some success in procuring rice. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation on behalf of the association. However, this association bears the full responsibility for the nationwide rice control. We must implement the planned arrangements effectively for military grain, civilian food, and grain for the military and civilians of allied nations, to achieve the intended goals. The past five months were just the beginning of the overall operation. In the future, we will have even more significant tasks. We still need everyone's continued efforts. Now, I will elaborate on the key points of this meeting:</p>
<p>Strive to Fulfill the Great Mission</p>
<p>First, regarding the previous procurement situation for the purchasing merchants, some slightly exceeded the planned amounts, some submitted the required amount as per the order, and some delivered half or less of the ordered quantity. The situations varied, and the results were naturally different. As for profits, some have already obtained considerable surpluses, while others have incurred losses due to difficulties in obtaining goods. The association fully understands this. We hope that you will continue to work hard in the future. Those who profited previously should be even more enthusiastic and procure even larger quantities than before. Those who suffered losses previously should study remedial measures this time, seek opportunities for compensation, and fulfill your ultimate responsibilities together to accomplish this great mission.</p>
<p>Thorough Assistance for Smooth Progress</p>
<p>Second, regarding the many obstacles encountered in procurement in the past, we have decided to do our utmost to break through all barriers in the future. You must promptly cooperate with the association, take joint and practical responsibility, and work hard together. In addition, we will ask our allied military police to use greater force to thoroughly assist us, so that we can make rapid and smooth progress. Third, the association will reward those purchasing merchants from various regions who have excellent performance and can fulfill their responsibilities and also protect their rights to the best of our ability. We hope that you will invigorate your spirits and continue to move forward. Do not retreat in the face of difficulties. If you encounter slight difficulties or suffer minor losses, do not be discouraged or lazy and request to withdraw. That would be a great disservice to the country and the people. The above three points are my sincere contributions to everyone. I hope we all have a spirit of dauntlessness and advance bravely together. Know that a bright future is in the near future.</p>

<h3>Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters Plans Women's Air Defense Clothing: Universally Worn on Three Air Defense Days</h3>
<p>A person in charge of the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters made the following statement regarding citizens wearing air defense clothing:</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced Announcement No. 21 on the first of this month and implemented blackout measures throughout the Shanghai Special Municipality from the third of this month, Shanghai has gradually entered the decisive stage of the war. This is a battle to defend Greater Shanghai and protect the lives and property of five million citizens. All kinds of civil defense activities should be carried out with utmost effort and without the slightest negligence. The Civil Defense Headquarters, in preparation for any eventuality, has been reorganizing all preparations. In order to prevent citizens from being injured and to facilitate initial fire prevention, evacuation, and rescue operations, the issue of citizens wearing air defense clothing is considered an important part of the air defense effort. We hope that citizens will strive to prepare it and wear it universally on the third "Air Defense Day" on March 9.</p>
<p>Remake Old Clothes to Save Resources</p>
<p>What the headquarters believes is urgently needed is the standard air defense clothing for Chinese women, which should be formulated as soon as possible. Therefore, we have repeatedly convened representatives from large department stores, social organizations, women's groups, and news reporters to discuss and integrate opinions from all parties so as to tailor air defense clothing that is adequate to the reality. As a result of the discussion, we first trialed a sample of the standard air defense clothing as shown in the photos below. However, considering that it is extremely difficult to purchase cotton cloth at this time, and prices are unusually high, it would be quite difficult to tailor new air defense clothing. To be economical and practical, old clothes can be remade. We hope that citizens can refer to the attached drawings, use the completed style as a blueprint, use old fabrics to make clothing similar to the standards, or create their own appropriate clothing and wear it regularly in preparation for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Key Points for Designing Air Defense Clothing</p>
<p>The design of air defense clothing is very important, and attention should be paid to the following: The exposed parts of the body, such as the head, face, hands, and feet, should be covered as much as possible to avoid burns and reduce the impact of shrapnel and gravel. The clothing should allow for extreme ease of movement, such as hiding in air-raid shelters or appropriate shelters, dodging shrapnel and rocks, or engaging in initial fire prevention or rescuing the elderly, weak, and young. Air defense clothing should be wearable in all seasons, regardless of the climate, and should be made of durable materials that can withstand long-term wear. If you can pay attention to the above points and make proper clothing for application, that will be the best policy.</p>
<p>Actively Prepare to Prevent Disasters</p>
<p>Chief Sun of the Headquarters General Affairs Office stated on the 4th of this month that the Greater East Asia War is not limited to the central or southwestern Pacific and the border of Myanmar. This city has also become a battlefield, so enemy planes may appear over this city at any time and drop bombs indiscriminately. To cope with this, it is necessary to conduct air defense training. At the same time, women and children should also wear air defense clothing. Do not neglect this at ordinary times, and actively prepare to prevent the disasters you may suffer. This point should be fully realized. All measures are for your own sake. We hope to devote efforts to the preparation and wearing of air defense clothing.</p>
<h3>Colleagues in the Industrial Raw Material Market Contribute Over 50,000 Yuan in Scholarship to Benefit Poor Students</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from colleagues in the Shanghai Industrial Raw Material Market, stating: "In recent years, the cost of living has soared.
