<h3 id="c1">教求讀者捐款助學 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近三天來，本報舉辦大東亞戰爭國民常識展覽會，同時假會塲發給本屆助學金申請表，着望學生們藉此得到一些戰時當織，凡是走過南京路外灘的人，都看見從滇池路（即仁記路起）環繞華懋飯店的長隊男女學生。伴着他們的有穴七十歲的老先生老太太，扶着他們從上海的東南西北趕來，有的上午三四點鐘，天還沒亮已經等着，一步一步慢慢地走上華懋八樓。這一大羣，不是擠油擠米的成年市民，不是要求施粥施飯的流浪難民，要不是那買票看戲的排隊者。他們是我們中華民國的小同胞，是我們中華民國十年一十年復要的種子，他們不避風霜，不畏艱苦，老遠的跑來，所要的不過是一紙申報讀者助事金的申請書。希望從這一張申請書裏，　到下學期求學的發會。</p>
<p>這一大隊未來的中國精華，引起無數路人的同情，引起華懋飯店職工住客們的這淚。讀者諸公們，請閉目想一想！這是什麼樣一幅景象！誰無父母？誰無子女？誰願意他的父母陪着他，冒着風霜，請求一點點學費？誰忍心敎他的子女，在西北鳳裏，趕着路，孤零零地自謀上進的機會？</p>
<p>我們現在寫出這一幅「男女老幼中請助學圖」，並不是希望讀者諸君的可憐。我們認爲這班小央雄們，不是可憐實是可敬。他們能够耐勞，能够耐苦，祖坦白白。憑他們這點工奮鬥的精神，這點子自立的勇氣，已經足够使上海的市民們慚愧得「汗流浹　」。可敬哉！申請助學金的男安學生！</p>
<p>但是，我們難道眼看這一羣小英雄們自生自滅，而一點不加以援助嗎？我們有了好花的種子，難道連一點點灌溉的力量都不願意盡嗎；想想！我們怎樣長成的，還不是受了許多人的扶育，受了國家社會長時期的培植，方才能够成功現在的我。扶育我的許多人，培植我的國家社會，更我們欽佩他們的先知先覺，更欽佩他們的達已達人。同時更使得我們辦事的同人感覺到無限的慚愧。我們的力量實在太棉薄了，我們不能够命令人家捐軟，我們只能　讀者們自由的捐助。爲了捐款的可貴，我們和各方面熱心參加工作的先生們，對於每個學生的學行，像用顯微鏡一般的檢當拿血汗的品學成績來答邀諸位。可是因為捐款的有限，我們竟不能不忍着心減少名額，眼見優秀靑年得不到上進的機會，我們心靈上的悲傷，總使我們整幾夜不能够睡覺。我們的滿腔熱忱，這支禿筆只能表現萬一。</p>
<p>我們的力量雖小，但是申報讀者們的力量是偉大的，我們認定，申報讀者們在大時代裏面一定能够做出偉大的成績。我們拿起筆等候着，替申報讀者諸公在復興中華民國的功勞簿上記上第一功，在復興中華民國的紀念碑上寫上第一名！</p>
<p>敬求護者，多多捐助！</p>

<p>張先生以七十有三的高齡，榮膺司法行政部長之職，近將晋京履任。張先牛不顧春秋之高，憂慮國事、接受最困雖最重要的司法要職，此已爲吾人所引爲欽佩。况且先生的抱負，崇高偉大，衡諸今日的國情，出長司法，允稱適當。此於本月八日上海五團體假座上海工商聯誼會會議歷開歡送茶會時，張先生於席上吐　其抱負的言　中，亦可充分窺知，而使吾人深爲感動。　人在長時期的中國生活經過中，常聽到日人或外人指摘中國文明遠較各國落後的　辭，頗有「中國無文化」的弦外之音，此爲吾人所屢感不滿者，蓋此係皮相的觀察中國之論。然而，吾人雖不滿於「無文化國」之稱，但就中國的現狀而觀，欲加反駁，不得不有所躊躇，並不得不感到遺憾。</p>

<p>試舉一喻臂之，中國這國家，决不如今日的暴發戶那種輕薄門，第，而是具有數百年傳統家風的名門，往以家主不得其人，以致日趨式徹，但家中尙有無數珍品什物，若一且家主得人，立即利用此等珍寶，叩可挽　回家運。惜中國的爲政者迄今猶未得其人。尤其在法典方面，中國　有足以充份說明絢爛的文化及最高道德的光榮時代，然此貴重的法典，深　資庫中，　閉於重　內，這實是非常可惜的。</p>
<p>幸而今日有張光生出來，以光生之高明廉潔的人格，必可打開　庫之門，取出塵封的法典，適用於現代的社會，運用公正廉明之法，以逐漸提高國民的道德，先生其將不吝努力乎？此爲吾人之最大期待，並深信必能成功。</p>
<p>張先生春秋固高，然　鑠有勝壯年，謹祈益自珍重，並望致力宣揚大東亞建設上不可或缺的國民道德，完成公正廉明的政治！最後，敬祝一平安！</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　自去年全國宜傳會議，於首都開會以後，各方空化人對於自身組織之結成，用以協力政府推進戰時文化宣傳政策基本綱要之實施，强化大東亞戰爭思想之陣營，此種機運，業經成熟。全國宣傳會議畢後，各地文化人紛返各地，徵詢文化界之意見，均一致主張迅速成立中國作家協會，或文學協會。宣，傳部林部長，有鑒於此，將以文化界一份子之資格，因爲交通關係，先就近函邀京滬文化界同人來京來京，就成立協會問題，作初步之商談。係商得大體一致之意見後，再函商綜合全國意見，始從事協會之籌備事宜。因事關文化人自身組織，希望文化界能自動負担責任，積極發揮本身力量，政府方面當！予以最大之協力。滬方文化界同人周化人，魯風，柳雨生，已於九日抵京，尙有周越然，陶晶傑，兩人，預定今日亦可以趕到。今晨京滬文化界局人，首先舉行第一次集會，林部長親臨主持，對於協會章則及成立方針，交換意見。下午復假福昌飯店繼續舉行集會，對於體同意，爲中國文學協會，聞明日上午仍纔續舉行集會。關於協會成立時期，發起人名單等，加以商討。本年春季大東亞文學者大會，旣經决定在我國舉行，各方對於文學者自身組織之創立，及其將來之使命，莫不寄予莫大之期待。</p>
<p>日本女子大學　增設「學校工廠」</p>
<p>日本文敎體制全面改編以後，日本女子大學方面，首先在全國女子專門學校的學園內附設學校工廠，建立女子敎育界中「兵學一體」的新的决　路標，與男子各校相呼應，關於該校的非常措置，文部省及軍事當局深致期待。這　時期的實驗，自來年開春即將用全校一致的熱心區實現。</p>
<p>學校工廠　由以前的勤勞報國隊及挺身隊在一定的期間實施，且避免了以前中止授課的　　，在增產上更與以刺激，而以前以為女學生難於實行的現在也竟實現了。</p>
<p>誕生的由來</p>
<p>學校工廠誕生的由來，因被男學生的出征所感動，而瑪金鳥，達拉瓦島的全軍殉國，更刺激了整個學園，於是迅速决定。該校預定冬季授期期間並不停止，以期即刻實現，申請歸省休假者亦絕無一人，可見其意志的熱烈。</p>
<p>當準備促進創設學校工廠時，學校當局菜巳獲得軍事當局的協力，請求軍需工廠派遺指導員以經營並設計工廠的一切，以原有十數敎室充作工廠，作業的範圍，也接受軍需工廠所流行的作業以外之工作部門，全校學生變成有專門技能的工員，不落家內工業的窠臼，且累積了勞務管理的經騐，養成將來爲女子工員指導者的幹部。</p>
<p>當寶際工作時，使用該校特有的服裝，面其，學校工廠附屬的研究室裘所使用實騐室用具，均爲手邊空閑不用的東西。工員的組織，以學內各科千六百名中附屬高等女子中學的高年級學生二百名充之，工廠經營則採各大舉的學校工廠制度，並對其學生工員行施適當的檢查及配置，以資將來。</p>
<p>由於這適當的配置，積極進行準備，以防止工廠內資材的消耗，而增進增產的效率，更待學校工廠完成後，以該校雄業生組織的全國櫻楓會會員共達八千名，自新學期起，並設「勤勞講座」，以謀强化學校工廠，不久即有在京會員二千名，入學校工廠學習各種作業，在其會員中，東朧目相夫人等名流婦人爲數亦不少，作爲女子勸勞報國隊的幹部，向該方面的活動，頗堪期待。</p>
<p>學校當局談</p>
<p>據學校常局談：「以前曾協助農村方面及動勞報國隊，學校工廠的出現茲又更前進」步，軍事當局頗注力於此，文部省方面亦頗致期待。最近爲學的態度，將可見到與以前完全不同的决心，授課决不間斷，因此·分派的工作如其洛後的塲合，即星期日亦不休息。爲提高學校工廠經營的能力起見，從各級選出學生代表赴軍需工廠演習，其意氣大爲激昻。」（翔：譯自十二月二十五日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>中央社訊　日本田尻公使於昨晚七時二十分起，在本市大東廣播電合發表廣播演說，題爲：「增強生產運動」，茲誌要旨於次：</p>
<p>後方人士努力生產</p>
<p>「祖國日本，現正展開大增產運動，國民政府三大政策之一，即爲增產問題，當爲諸位所熟知，華中產業共榮聯合會於昨日（一月九日）中國參戰紀念日，展開增强生產運動，今後凡挺事任何職業之產業人員，均應盡最大努力，增强生產，又應儘量磨勵，促進生產能率，此誠係供應目前國家需要之要締，凡後方之產業界人士，均應乘此機會，把握增强運動之眞髓，積極從事增强戰力，勿容有一人之落伍。同時凡以往尸位素餐，或從事非國家需要之不生產事業者，均應一致奮起，參加此一運動。大東亞戰爭爲國家總力戰，敵國英美亦集舉其國家總力，動員其所有人力物力及科學力，以從事决戰，彼等以多數飛機多數艦船，供作最大犧牲，繼續反抗，吾人正義所在，固可得最後勝利，然爲摧毀彼等之此種反抗，以獲得必勝之戰果起見，凡我後方產業人負，職責所在，自屬彰彰明甚，吾人不應有片刻之猶豫，唯有集結總力，努力增强生產，用盡一切方法，克服前途所有障碍，大東亞戰爭對於產業戰士，實爲生產之决勝戰也。</p>
<p>傾注全力增强戰力</p>
<p>前線之要求，乃爲後方之生產能切合前綫之需要，因此生產成爲規定第一錢規模之重大要事，凡後方一切總力，均應一致集中於生產，斯誠爲完成大東亞戰學之國家要求也。一切人力物力或科學力，固應傾注於增强戰力上所最主要之生產部門，然欲望在綜合生產過程上，克服其所遭逢之困難及障碍，而達到增强生產目的者，究不外於挺身產業之氣魄也。</p>
<p>生產方法研究改善</p>
<p>試就諸君所採用之生產方法及事業之運營等加以考慮，嚴格言之，决非已盡人智，必尙有研究餘地，决不可認爲較忚處或已往已有進步而自足，必應始終堅持，增强戰力之熱忱，竭力加以考慮研究，大而至於粽合生產組織及運營之改善，小而至於一旋　，一鐵鎚等之用法，或事務之簡捷化等，均尙多研究之餘地。凡經理廠長以及工人職員等，倘能一致精究其所担當工作，十倍發揚其能率，則生產始能增加十倍。華中產業共榮會實施本運動之要領，計分作業方法之改善。設備·機械·器具之改善，熱管理之改善，及電力之節約，勞力之節約，事務及事業用品並資材之節約，事務之簡捷，廢物之收回及改造，遊休資材之治用，運轉效率之增進’成改善等種種。一種特定有能率的方法，如能廣泛普及於各種事業，則生產即可一舉增强數倍至數十倍，此可不拘於事業之大小，凡鐵鎚之打法或旋牀之用法，及相互間之聯絡如何，均有關係，且亦非僅賴於專門家或研究所至鑽研，必須各業人員之努力到底，始可達到目的，而展開增强生產運動之意義，深信亦在於此。</p>
<p>目前已非空言譯論</p>
<p>目前非係議論時期，凡各業人員均應團結一致，發揮全力，從事研究生產之增强（余所謂增强生產，其中常包括運輸，通信問題，希加注意），客服一戰爭兵站產業之任務。又國府重要國策之一，即係實踐大規模增產問題，亦即中國之參戰，因此得以具體日積極的促進，中國方面之增產運動，不獨直接貢獻於戰爭物資之增强，同時因此得以昻揚中國民衆之參戰意識，即進而由精神方面貢戲於戰力之增强。當此時會，中日人士一體組織之產業共榮會爲呼應中日兩國之增產運動而展開本運動，其成果會堪重視，希望全體產業人員，一致奮起，完成所負使命。</p>

<p>各界熱烈贊襄助學</p>
<p>本屆助學金蒙各界紛紛響應已漸見增加。昨承丁山挂君慨捐一萬元，嘉惠淸寒，裨益匪淺。鄒鵠秋君以利句華誕，特節筵資一萬二千元，除八千元充其他義舉外，以四千元捐本報助學金。皇家西菜社一小侍者，杜寅生君爲表示同情，節小賬一部份計一百元助學。服務於本報常識展覽會會塲之第一警局第三七六號及二六一七號警察，對申請學生深表同情，特捐助洋三百元。浦緝庭君同情失學子弟，捐贈縐紗面駱駝絨袍子，毛葛馬褂谷一件，委託義賣助學。凡此熟情，足表人類最高之同情，希望社會有力人士，繼起響應，踴躍捐輸，幸甚幸甚。</p>

<h3 id="c29">重點中之重點 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>國府參戰進入第二年，主席闡明施策重點，聲明今年的一年，當以增產運動爲重點中之重點，而目前增產施策以養電養民爲二大目標，足　主席一面　衡時勢，一面痛察民國，故求養民養戰同時做到。環顧世界參戰國家，能够同時做到養民着戰的，實在寥寥無幾，即以號稱世界最富的國家美國而論，其農業生產的力量，近兩年來，早已爲其軍需工業所剝奪，以致民間物資配給量不得不隨著國內農業生產量的低落而日漸減縮，可爲明證。</p>
<p>養民看戰何以必須同時做到？這是戰時的一個天經地義，也不必再去解釋它了，不過，增產即爲養民養戰的惟一途徑，而增產程序中之急要者，復即入主席所言，爲耕地之開拓，晨業技術之改良，中堅農民之組成，與衣食關係最切之輕工業的復興，那末，我們便感覺「爲政不在多言，而在力行」：從國府參戰第二年始，我們便當努力把以前增產的言論，變為今後增產的事實，至低的限度，萬勿再開「倒車」，坐令生產萎縮，坐令人民的衣食問題，走上日暮途窮之路，徒使劾力於前方者，日日顧慮其父母兄弟妻子的生活文題，効力欲後方者，日日雖欲求一溫飽而不可得，那末，豈不要因為不能養民遂致不能養戰嗎？在過去一年中也會翻覆申論國。即在今之計」喚起公眾的主意，並且特別側重於農也生產量之推進，即是此意。</p>

<p>（續昨日第三版）</p>
<p>去年十一月六日，在大東亞會議的最後一日，發出大東亞共同宣言，標示建設東亞的　領。　大東亞各國確保大東亞之安定，以道義爲基礎，建設共存共榮之秩序。　大東亞各國互相尊重，其自主獨立，力求互助敦睦，以確立大東亞之親和。　大東亞各國互相尊重其傳銃發展各民族之創造性，以闡揚大東亞之文化。　大東亞各國，本於互惠緊密提携，以促進其經濟發展，增進大東亞之繁榮。　大東亞各國，增進萬邦之友誼，撤慶人種的差別，普行溝通文化，進而開放資源，以期貨獻於世界之進展。這個宜言和綱領的發佈，是證明大東亞各民族，由於各自獨立，進而團結，以建設新的自由獨立大東亞，這樣大東亞戰爭的目的，不抵已經達到，而且這個目的，已經確保了。我們參戰的目的，是達到而確保了，然而戰塲的戰鬥還沒有完成，所以在我們參戰的紀念日，應該檢討過去，和策勵將來，我們更應該在這個參職日，加緊較勵我們的人民，增加我們的力量的。</p>
<p>我今天且在上海官上海罷，過去參戰的一年，中國的租界，無論專管的，公共的，都收回了在華的治外法權，也撤廢了，雖然許多未了手續，還在進行，中國所被束縛的不平等條約，巳完全廢除了，不過我們萬不要以爲這是我們成績，還不過是中國完成自由獨立的過程，不過是中日履行同甘共苦，和同生共死的一種表現，實際上我們能够在前方參加人力，努力於戰鬥，在後方增加生產，確保治安，這才是我們眞正的成績。因此我們的僑胞一千餘萬，在南洋各地，在泰國，在緬甸，在菲律賓，在馬來，在爪哇，以及其他在前綫的各地，應該更加努力，協助同盟國的日本，和當地的大東亞的同胞們，努力奮鬥，更應該協助自由印度的自由政府奮鬥，不完成戰塲的勝利不止，不完成戰爭的目的也不止，我們還有數萬萬的同胞，急迫着完成解放，以爲僑胞們的後盾，我們也時時準備着親赴前方，以爲各明國的後增。更因此我們在後方的同胞，還更應該努力增產，保障治安。參戰一年的當中，我們雖然有了不少的進步，同時也發現亟須補救的缺點，上海的生產，我們設覺顯然的退步了，其問或者因爲原料騰貴，而影響到生產的，或者因爲原料缺乏，而影響到生產的，最近更因燃料減少，而影響到生產的，這些情形，固然在戰爭期間不能免的現象，不過這些情形，在戰爭期間，一定要解决的，解决這些問題，固然是政府的責任，也是人民共同的實任，我們無論如何，我們必須把這個難關衝破，必須把這個問題解决。</p>
<p>再則我們上海的治安，雖然比較過去幾年進步，然而我們還是不能認爲滿意，我所謂治安，不是專指市內的治安而是指一般上海特別市管轄下市內和市外的一般治安，上海市內的保甲，上海市內的警察，會爲者治安努力奮鬥，這是我應該感謝的，上海市外的保安隊，警察大隊，警察，和其他協助我們淸鄕的部隊，會爲着治安努力奮鬥，這也是我應該感謝的，可是上海的淸鄕，到了今日，已是第二期，而第三淸鄕地區，也於去年十二月開始了，對於一般治安，我認爲還有遺憾，保衛治安，固然是政府之責，而守望相助，疾病相扶持，也同時是一般人民之責，我期望着大家明瞭，基於大東亞戰爭的重大意義，中國自由獨立的重大意義，軍民更加協力，來確保後方的治安。上海處此大東亞戰爭的大後方地位，一切不自然的事實，我認爲必須消滅了，一切矛盾的事實，我認爲必須消滅了，參戰一年中檢討的結果，進步的我們使牠更進步，缺點的我們必定去補救，這樣我們才能確保戰爭的目的，才能確保自由獨立的目的。</p>
<p>今天更是上海的防空日，我已經預備更有廣播，今日在紀念會的，我更鄭重的吿訴諸位，在戰爭時期，尤其在今日立體戰爭時期，我們對於空襲，是不能過取樂觀的。在空襲眞的來臨，我們也不必慌亂的，因爲這是戰爭中必然的事實，對於這種事實的存在，第一我們必須把牠消滅，第二我們必須把牠防備。上海是我們的大後方，上海是我們的經濟中心，在我們的意料中，敵人必須擾亂的，我們若果揣測，以爲上海不會有空製，這是錯誤的，我們揣測上海縱有空襲，也不會嚴重，這也是錯誤的，我們必須有萬全的準備，來應付萬一的變故，因此我們有防空本部的設立，有防空日的規定，我希望同胞各位務須了解這個意義，大家不要疏懈，大家不要廢弛，我發現上海的同胞們，對於防空太過於樂觀和隨便了，無事之時，過於隨便，有事之時，亦必過於混亂，我看不慣今日大家的鬆懈，尤其不忍看他日大家的手足無措，所以特在今天這個紀念會和紀念日，喚起大家的注意，諸位先生，防空是參戰的一部門工作，也是保衛生產和確保治安的一件最重要的工作，我們官民團結一致，努力合作，來迎取大東亞戰爭的勝利罷（完）</p>

<p>— 朱述訓</p>
<p>自商統會實施收買紗布後，內地原棉價格，與製成品價格之上漲，背道而馳，鄉農不願脫售原棉，固屬事實。然以目前嘉定市價，農民將一斤原棉（市價三十元，棉統會價格本地棉僅二十六元另送公庫）出賣，而易以等量之十六支紗二支，每支價一百十元，共二百二十元，其間相差達一百九十元，鄕農實不勝中間商及運雜費之剝削矣！最近嘉定各地農民，以秋收已過，閑暇無事，紛理三十年前之舊工作，即紡製土紗是也。目下土紗價每斤約六十元，較之等量之廠紗，便宜達一百六十元之鉅。値此政府提倡節約運動聲，獎厲土紗土布之生產中，於農村經濟方面不無小補。接着，難關來了，嘉定全區每日各行約可收集土紗十担，約合廠紗二件，按月計之出路亦一問題，本地木機織布，門面僅一尺五六寸，實不合現時代之需要，運甲又視爲畏途。最好申地各廠商，如能合作試辦，在此原料缺乏聲中，將土紗加以時代化之織染，以充工服軍服及農民之服裝，國民經濟生活方面當得極大補助。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Seeking Donations from Readers to Aid Students <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>For the past three days, our newspaper has been holding the Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition. At the same time, we are issuing application forms for this year's student aid grants at the exhibition venue, hoping that students can gain some wartime knowledge from this. Anyone who has walked along the Bund on Nanjing Road has seen the long lines of male and female students circling the Cathay Hotel (starting from滇池 Road, i.e.,仁記 Road). Accompanying them are seventy-year-old gentlemen and ladies, who support them as they rush from all directions in Shanghai, some waiting as early as three or four in the morning before dawn, slowly walking up to the eighth floor of the Cathay. This large group is not made up of adult citizens squeezing for oil and rice, nor are they homeless refugees asking for porridge and food, nor are they people lining up to buy tickets to see a show. They are our little compatriots of the Republic of China, the seeds that our Republic of China must revive in ten to twenty years. They brave the wind and frost, unafraid of hardship, running from afar, seeking nothing more than an application form for the 申報 reader's aid fund. They hope to obtain funding for the next semester of their studies from this application.</p>
<p>This large contingent of future Chinese elites has aroused the sympathy of countless passersby and brought tears to the eyes of the staff and guests of the Cathay Hotel. Dear readers, please close your eyes and imagine this scene! What kind of picture is this! Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? Who would want their parents to accompany them, braving the wind and frost, to request a little tuition? Who has the heart to teach their children to rush on the road in the northwest wind, seeking opportunities for self-improvement alone?</p>
<p>We are now writing this "Picture of Men, Women, Old and Young Applying for Student Aid" not to hope for the pity of our readers. We believe that these little heroes are not pitiful but respectable. They are able to endure labor, able to endure hardship, and frankly honest. Based on their spirit of hard work and their courage to be self-reliant, they are already enough to make the citizens of Shanghai ashamed and "sweat profusely." How admirable! The male and female students applying for student aid!</p>
<p>However, can we just watch these little heroes fend for themselves without offering any assistance? We have seeds of good flowers; are we unwilling to even exert a little bit of irrigation power? Think! How did we grow up? Wasn't it through the support of many people and the long-term cultivation of the country and society that we were able to succeed and become who we are today. We admire the many people who supported us and the country and society that cultivated us, and we admire their foresight and their ability to help others achieve their goals. At the same time, it makes our colleagues feel infinite shame. Our strength is really too weak. We cannot order people to donate money; we can only rely on readers to donate freely. To ensure the value of the donations, we and the enthusiastic gentlemen from all parties participating in the work scrutinize each student's academic performance as if using a microscope, using hard-earned academic results to answer everyone's expectations. However, because the donations are limited, we cannot help but reduce the number of recipients, and seeing excellent young people unable to get opportunities for advancement, the sadness in our hearts prevents us from sleeping for several nights. Our full enthusiasm can only be expressed in a ten-thousandth part by this worn-out pen.</p>
<p>Our strength is small, but the strength of the 申報 readers is great. We firmly believe that the 申報 readers will be able to achieve great results in this great era. We pick up our pens and wait, to record the first contribution of the 申報 readers to the meritorious service book of the revival of the Republic of China, and to write the first name on the monument to the revival of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Respectfully request that protectors donate generously!</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 PM this afternoon: The Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted approximately 150 enemy planes attacking Rabaul on the morning of January 9th, shooting down 52 of them (19 of which are unconfirmed). Two of our planes did not return to base. Regarding the previously announced results of the air battle over Rabaul by the Imperial Navy Air Force on January 7th, an additional three enemy planes shot down have now been added.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The air battles over Rabaul have become increasingly fierce since the beginning of this year. Although the enemy forces have suffered repeated heavy blows, they continue to stubbornly counterattack. On the morning of the 9th, the enemy attacked Rabaul with a total of 150 planes of various types. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, resulting in a fierce air battle. As a result, Japanese planes shot down 16 enemy 54V-type planes (5 of which are unconfirmed), 13 565-type planes (3 of which are unconfirmed), and 16 065-type planes (7 of which are unconfirmed), totaling 52 planes (19 of which are unconfirmed). The shot-down rate in this battle reached 34.7%, meaning the number shot down accounted for more than one-third of the attacking enemy planes. Furthermore, only two Japanese planes did not return in this battle. The ratio of Japanese to American results was 52 to 2.

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - A certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: After inflicting heavy damage on enemy forces encountered by Japanese forces in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea Island, the Japanese forces gathered at Kara and waited for further action.

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The National Economic Commission of the National Government convened its second plenary commission meeting on June 25th of last year, reviewing the implementation of wartime economic policies and passing various important proposals, which were put into effect. The third plenary commission meeting was originally scheduled to be convened on September 25th of last year, but it was postponed due to various reasons. Now that the date has long passed, and after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the declaration of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to jointly discuss the promotion and implementation of our country's economic policies in the future. It has been specifically decided to convene the third plenary commission meeting on January 15th of this year, and all commissioners inside and outside the capital have been notified to attend the meeting at that time.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Kubota Mantaro, the secretary-general of the Theater Literary Department of the Japan Literary Patriotic Society and the joint chairman of the Japan Theater Association, a famous Japanese playwright, has recently set off for China to discuss Sino-Japanese theatrical cooperation with our central authorities and promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges. He passed through Shanghai and arrived in Nanjing on the second day.

<h3 id="e6">Recent Situation in Guilin <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a certain cultural figure took advantage of the battle of Hong Kong to enter the interior towards Chongqing. Recently, unable to bear the hardship of living there, he came to Guangzhou from Guilin at the end of last year. According to him, the recent situation in Guilin is as follows: Due to the sharp increase in population and the limited number of houses, finding housing is very difficult, and rents are rising day by day. An ordinary rented room costs 2,000 yuan per month, and a top-quality towel costs 120 yuan each. Other items are also in short supply. Although rice prices are relatively low, it is difficult to fully supply the food for the 700,000 citizens. Corrupt officials are rampant and unrestrained. Since last autumn, several corrupt officials have been brought to justice. Secondly, in terms of military affairs, Guilin has now been completely transformed into a base for the American air force. The overbearing behavior of the American air force stationed in Chongqing is beyond description. They ride into the city every afternoon, indulging in a life of extravagance and dissipation. Although there have been American military police monitoring the streets recently, it is still difficult to correct their actions. In the past, many Chinese people often frequented various dance halls, but now they have disappeared. The authorities in Chongqing, in order to avoid the general public condemning the American air force, are attempting to change the perception. Based on the above situation, the public's antipathy towards the American air force still seems extremely strong. As for the intellectual class, they are all extremely indifferent to the current war. The main reason is the pain of living.</p>

The gist of his speech was: The call for increased aircraft production has now spread throughout the country. Our entire nation concentrated its efforts last year on the massive production of aircraft. We, as the central administrative officials in charge of aircraft production, are truly grateful. Since last year, we have carefully reviewed Japan's national strength from all aspects, and we have recently determined the plan for aircraft production this year (until the end of March next year). Although the true figures cannot be revealed, they are indeed quite large. When this plan is realized, it will break through the difficult war situation of the past year. Moreover, the realization of this plan is by no means impossible, nor is it forcing the impossible to be possible, but rather making the possible possible. What I could not have imagined a year ago is that what I considered impossible a year ago, I am now confident is possible.</p>

<p>Shonan, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, it has issued a declaration to the world, expressing its determination to use all its strength to overthrow its old enemy, Britain, and liberate the oppressed nations of East Asia. It has also organized the National Army to advance towards New Delhi, the capital of India, from Burma. Under the leadership of the Provisional Government, the Indian people have firmly resolved to gain the independence of their homeland and have decided to abide by the following three rules: 1. The Indian National Army is a purely Indian army. 2. Under the command of the Provisional Government, the National Army is determined to unite and gather all its strength to overthrow Britain and seek the independence of its homeland. 3. The National Army is determined to adopt a policy of elite troops, and at the same time, it is determined to adopt as many outstanding individuals as possible who volunteer to join the National Army. The post of Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army will be concurrently held by Bose, the chairman of the Provisional Government. Furthermore, in order to closely link the Provisional Government and the National Army, eight cadres from the National Army will be selected to serve in the government. Currently, National Army training centers have been established in Shonan and various parts of the South to train volunteers aged 14 to 40, divided into infantry, artillery, mechanized units, and other subjects. The students undergoing training in various places do not avoid the sweltering heat, actively training day and night.

<h3 id="e12">Italy's Western Front Unveils New Offensive, Meets Tenacious German Resistance <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: Following the large-scale breakthrough attempts by the Anglo-American forces between Mignano and Venafro, only in the San Vittore area were attacks launched with powerful formations, and all enemy activities were focused on this point. The unfolding of this new war situation on the western front is due to the enemy's attempt, regardless of all sacrifices, to break through the defensive artillery network at the entrance of the Cassino Highway, which was unsuccessful. Therefore, the Anglo-American forces concentrated all their efforts in the area northwest of the ruins of Monte Cassino in order to enter the Cassino Lowlands and allow their tank formations to gain freedom of movement. Due to this, after the first batch of American tank divisions suffered heavy losses in the narrow mountainous area over the past few days, the second batch of American tank divisions prepared to take action. After detailed reconnaissance by the German forces, they were well-prepared for the intentions of the invading forces and offered the invaders tenacious resistance near San Vittore. The Anglo-American forces even concentrated a large number of weapons, but the result was that they still failed to launch an offensive with a wedge-shaped squadron and collapsed under the defensive fire of the German forces. At the same time, a squadron of Canadian forces reinforcing along the coastal highway was blocked from launching a fierce attack.</p>

<p>Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Farewell to Mr. Zhang Yipeng <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Kurimoto Toraji</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, at the advanced age of seventy-three, has been honored with the position of Minister of Judicial Administration and will soon be going to Nanjing to assume his duties. Mr. Zhang, disregarding his advanced age and concerned about national affairs, has accepted the most difficult and important position in the judiciary, which has already earned our admiration. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's ambitions are lofty and great, and judging from the current national situation, his appointment as Minister of Justice is truly appropriate. This can be fully seen in Mr. Zhang's speech at the farewell tea party held by five Shanghai organizations at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association on the 8th of this month, which deeply moved us. In my long experience of living in China, I have often heard Japanese or foreigners criticize Chinese civilization as being far behind other countries, with the implication that "China has no culture," which has repeatedly displeased us, as this is a superficial observation of China. However, although we are dissatisfied with the claim of "uncultured country," when we look at the current situation in China, we cannot help but hesitate to refute it and must feel regret.</p>
<p>China is said to be the country with the highest moral origins in the East, but the reason why it is in its current state is due to years of corruption. To use an analogy, China is definitely not like today's nouveau riche, but rather a famous family with hundreds of years of tradition. In the past, the family head was not the right person, which led to the gradual decline of the family. However, there are still countless treasures and valuables in the house. If the family head is the right person, he can immediately use these treasures to save the family's fortunes. Unfortunately, the rulers of China have not yet been the right people. Especially in the legal field, China once had a glorious era that fully demonstrated a brilliant culture and the highest morality. However, these valuable laws are deeply buried in the treasury, locked away, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, today Mr. Zhang has emerged. With Mr. Zhang's high moral character and integrity, he will surely be able to open the door of the treasury, take out the dusty laws, apply them to modern society, and use fair and upright laws to gradually raise the moral standards of the people. Will Mr. Zhang spare no effort in this regard? This is our greatest expectation, and we deeply believe that he will succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is indeed old, but his spirit is even greater than that of a young man. We respectfully pray that he will take good care of himself and strive to promote the national morality that is indispensable for the construction of Greater East Asia, and complete a fair and upright government! Finally, we respectfully wish him peace!</p>
<h3 id="e15">Joint Gathering of Cultural Figures from Beijing and Shanghai to Exchange Ideas on Establishing a Literary Association <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the National Propaganda Conference held in the capital last year, cultural figures from all quarters have considered the formation of their own organizations to assist the government in implementing the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policies and strengthening the ideological camp of the Greater East Asia War. This opportunity has matured. After the National Propaganda Conference, cultural figures from various regions returned to their respective areas to solicit opinions from the cultural circles. There was unanimous agreement on the need to promptly establish a Chinese Writers Association or Literary Association. Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, recognizing this need and acting in his capacity as a member of the cultural community, has, due to transportation constraints, sent letters to cultural figures from Beijing and Shanghai to come to Nanjing to hold preliminary discussions on the establishment of the association. After reaching a general consensus, he will then consult with the rest of the country to consolidate opinions before proceeding with the preparatory work for the association. As the matter concerns the self-organization of cultural figures, it is hoped that the cultural community will automatically assume responsibility and actively exert its own strength, while the government will provide the greatest possible assistance. Cultural figures from Shanghai, including Zhou Huaren, Lu Feng, and Liu Yusheng, arrived in Nanjing on the 9th. Zhou Yueran and Tao Jingjie are also expected to arrive today. This morning, cultural figures from Beijing and Shanghai held their first meeting, presided over by Minister Lin, to exchange views on the charter and establishment guidelines of the association. In the afternoon, they continued the meeting at the Fuchang Hotel, generally agreeing to the name "Chinese Literary Association." It is reported that further meetings will be held tomorrow morning to discuss the timing of the association's establishment, the list of initiators, and other matters. With the decision to hold the Greater East Asia Literary Conference in our country this spring, all parties are placing great expectations on the establishment of a self-governing organization for writers and its future mission.</p>
<p>Japanese Women's University Adds "School Factory"</p>
<p>Following the complete reorganization of Japan's educational system, the Japanese Women's University is the first to establish a school factory within the campus of a national women's vocational school, creating a new landmark of "unity of military affairs and education" in the women's education field, in response to the various men's schools. The Ministry of Education and military authorities have high expectations for this extraordinary measure taken by the school. This timely experiment will be implemented with the wholehearted enthusiasm of the entire school starting next spring.</p>
<p>The school factory will be implemented for a set period of time by the existing Labor Service Corps and Volunteer Corps, avoiding interruptions in classes that occurred in the past, and stimulating increased production. What was previously thought to be difficult for female students to accomplish has now been realized.</p>
<p>Origin of the Birth</p>
<p>The birth of the school factory was inspired by the departure of male students for war, and further stimulated by the heroic sacrifice of the entire garrison on Makin Island and Tarawa. The school quickly made a decision to proceed. The school plans not to suspend classes during the winter break in order to realize the project immediately. Not a single student applied for leave to return home, demonstrating their ardent determination.</p>
<p>When preparing to promote the establishment of the school factory, the school authorities had already obtained the cooperation of the military authorities, requesting the dispatch of instructors from munitions factories to manage and design all aspects of the factory. More than a dozen existing classrooms were used as factories, and the scope of work included departments beyond the work typically handled by munitions factories. The entire student body will become skilled factory workers, avoiding the limitations of cottage industry, and accumulating experience in labor management, nurturing future cadres to guide female workers.</p>
<p>During actual work, students will wear unique school uniforms. The tools used in the school factory's attached research laboratory and the experimental equipment used will all be items that are currently idle and not in use. The factory's workforce will be composed of 1,600 students from all departments within the school, including 200 senior students from the attached higher girls' middle school. The factory will operate on a large-scale school factory system, and appropriate inspections and placements will be carried out for the student workers to benefit them in the future.</p>
<p>Due to this appropriate placement, preparations are being actively made to prevent the consumption of materials within the factory and to increase the efficiency of production. Furthermore, after the school factory is completed, the school's alumni organization, the National Cherry Blossom Maple Society, with its 8,000 members, will, starting from the new semester, establish a "Labor Lecture Series" to strengthen the school factory. Soon, 2,000 members in Kyoto will enter the school factory to learn various operations. Among its members, many prominent women such as Mrs. Higashikuni, are expected to serve as cadres in the Women's Labor Service Corps and actively participate in related activities.</p>
<p>Talks by School Authorities</p>
<p>According to school authorities: "We have previously assisted the rural areas and the Labor Service Corps. The emergence of the school factory is a further step forward." The military authorities are paying close attention to this, and the Ministry of Education also has high expectations. Recently, one can see a completely different determination towards learning compared to the past. Classes will not be interrupted, so if work is behind schedule, there will be no rest even on Sundays. To improve the management capacity of the school factory, student representatives from all levels will be selected to practice in munitions factories, greatly arousing their enthusiasm."

<p>Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the Swiss newspaper "Zurich News," a German military spokesperson stated that in order to adapt to the future developments of the war situation, the German army on the Eastern Front may make a large-scale adjustment to its front lines. However, it was not specified whether the adjustment would be limited to the areas along the Dnieper River or would encompass the entire front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) – The winter offensive and defensive battles in the southern part of the Eastern Front are now rapidly intensifying. The German and Soviet forces are engaged in day and night mechanized warfare along a 500-kilometer front from Rovino near the old Polish border in the north to Kirovograd in the bend of the Dnieper River. In this winter battle, the Soviet army seems to be aiming not only at occupying territory but also at destroying the German military strength. Therefore, regardless of heavy casualties, it continues to deploy troops and launch fierce attacks on German positions. However, the German army, with its skillful offensive and defensive operations, is blunting the Soviet advance everywhere, preventing it from achieving its operational goals. According to front-line reports, the Soviet forces advancing towards Sarny via Olevsk, northwest of Korosten, are encountering fierce German attacks 12 miles from Sarny. German forces from the Kirovograd area withdrew from the city on the night of the 8th, but on the 9th, they launched fierce counterattacks with tank units in various areas south, southwest, and north of the city, seeking to regain the initiative. Soviet forces advancing west towards Zhytomyr are also engaged in fierce battles with reinforcing German forces near Baranno. Soviet forces attacking Lanivtsi from the south of Berdychiv are being blocked near Lintin.</p>

The city of Kirovograd, which the German army evacuated the night before, is now the center of the fiercest fighting. After fierce street battles, the city has become a pile of rubble. According to well-informed German sources, German armored units south, southwest, and north of Kirovograd are now counterattacking, splitting their offensive strength.</p>

<h3 id="e25">To Strengthen the Production Movement, Minister Tajiri Broadcasted Last Night <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Japanese Minister Tajiri gave a broadcast speech on the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Corporation in this city from 7:20 PM last night, entitled: "Strengthening the Production Movement." The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>People in the Rear Should Strive to Produce</p>
<p>"The motherland Japan is now carrying out a large-scale production increase movement. One of the three major policies of the National Government is the issue of production increase, which should be familiar to everyone. The Central China Industrial Co-prosperity Association launched the Strengthen Production Movement yesterday (January 9th), the anniversary of China's entry into the war. In the future, all industrial personnel engaged in any occupation should make their greatest efforts to increase production and should also strive to promote production efficiency. This is truly an essential element in meeting the current needs of the country. All people in the rear industry should take this opportunity to grasp the essence of the strengthening movement and actively engage in strengthening the war effort, without allowing anyone to fall behind. At the same time, all those who have been holding positions without performing their duties, or engaging in unproductive businesses that are not needed by the country, should rise up together and participate in this movement. The Greater East Asia War is a total war for the nation. The enemy countries of Britain and the United States are also gathering their total national strength, mobilizing all their manpower, material resources, and scientific power to engage in the decisive battle. They are making the greatest sacrifices with a large number of aircraft and a large number of ships to continue their resistance. Our justice lies in securing the final victory, but in order to destroy their resistance and achieve the war result we must win, all our industry personnel in the rear bear the responsibility. We should not hesitate for a moment, but only gather our total strength, strive to increase production, and use all methods to overcome all obstacles in the future. The Greater East Asia War is truly a decisive battle for production for the industrial warriors.</p>
<p>Pour All Efforts into Strengthening the War Effort</p>
<p>The demand of the front line is that the production in the rear must meet the needs of the front line, so production has become a major issue that determines the scale of the front line. All the total strength of the rear should be focused on production, which is truly the national demand to complete the Greater East Asia War. All manpower, material resources, or scientific power should be devoted to the most important production sectors that strengthen the war effort. However, the desire to overcome the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the integrated production process and achieve the goal of increasing production is ultimately nothing more than the spirit of the industrial personnel.</p>
<p>Research and Improve Production Methods</p>
<p>Consider the production methods and business operations that you use. Strictly speaking, human wisdom has not been exhausted. There must still be room for research. You must never be satisfied with progress in certain areas or past progress. You must always adhere to the enthusiasm of strengthening the war effort, and strive to consider and research it. From the improvement of the organization and operation of integrated production to the use of a wrench or a hammer, or the simplification of affairs, there is still much room for research. If managers, factory directors, workers, and employees can all work together to improve the work they are responsible for and increase their efficiency tenfold, then production can be increased tenfold. The Central China Industrial Co-prosperity Association has divided the key points for implementing this movement into improvement of operating methods, improvement of equipment, machinery, and tools, improvement of heat management, and conservation of electricity, conservation of labor, conservation of office and business supplies and materials, simplification of affairs, recovery and transformation of waste, treatment of idle materials, improvement of operating efficiency, and various improvements. If a specific efficient method can be widely popularized in various businesses, then production can be increased several times to dozens of times. This is not limited to the size of the business, and everything from the hammering method to the use of the lathe and the communication between each other is related. It is also not only dependent on the research of experts or research institutes. The efforts of personnel in all industries must be pursued to the end to achieve the goal, and the significance of launching a production enhancement movement lies in this.</p>
<p>The Current Situation is No Longer a Matter of Empty Talk</p>
<p>The current situation is not a time for discussion. All personnel in all industries should unite and exert all their strength to engage in research to increase production (transportation and communication issues are often included in what I call increased production, I hope you pay attention), and overcome the task of a war logistics industry. In addition, one of the important national policies of the National Government is to practice large-scale production increase, which is also China's participation in the war. Therefore, the production increase movement on the Chinese side can be promoted in a concrete, active way, which not only directly contributes to the increase of war materials, but also enhances the war participation consciousness of the Chinese people, and even contributes to the strengthening of war effort from the spiritual aspect. At this time, the Industry Co-prosperity Association, jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese personnel, launched this movement in response to the production increase movement of China and Japan. Its results will be worthy of attention. I hope that all industrial personnel will rise up together and complete their missions.</p>

<p>Central News Agency report: Regarding the ration of household rice for the citizens of Shanghai, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, stated to the press the day before yesterday that, as a result of the committee's active efforts and with the enthusiastic cooperation of the relevant authorities, more than 300,000 dan of white rice have recently arrived in Shanghai. To ensure the household rice ration, which had been delayed several times, they are rushing to complete the various ration procedures and are scheduled to start distributing them uniformly today. However, according to a notice issued yesterday by a district office, the 59th period of household rice will not be available for sale until tomorrow. Each coupon will be exchanged for two sheng of broken rice, brown rice, or polished rice, at a price of 16 yuan in total. At the same time, household flour will also be sold tomorrow, with each coupon exchanged for half a jin of No. 1 flour and half a jin of No. 2 flour, at a price of 7 yuan and 5 jiao in total.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Application Deadline Was Yesterday, Arousing Widespread Sympathy from All Walks of Life <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The National Knowledge Exhibition hosted by this newspaper was successfully closed yesterday, which was also the last day to apply for the Reader's Scholarship. Most of those who went to get the forms were from the industrial and commercial sectors and former students. Over 3,000 copies were issued throughout the day, bringing the total number of forms issued in three days to more than 16,000. Given the current amount of scholarship funds, at least three times more donations will be needed to cover this enormous number. This depends on the enthusiastic response from all walks of life and their strong support.</p>
<p>All Circles Enthusiastically Support the Scholarship</p>
<p>The scholarship has seen a gradual increase in support from all circles. Yesterday, Mr. Ding Shanhua generously donated 10,000 yuan to benefit the poor and make a great contribution. Mr. Zou Huqiu specially set aside 12,000 yuan from his birthday banquet. In addition to 8,000 yuan for other charity causes, 4,000 yuan was donated to this newspaper's scholarship. Du Yinsheng, a small waiter at the Royal Western Restaurant, expressed his sympathy by donating a portion of his small account, totaling 100 yuan, to the scholarship. Police officers No. 376 and No. 2617 of the First Police Bureau, who served at the exhibition hall of this newspaper's Knowledge Exhibition, expressed their deep sympathy for the applying students and specially donated 300 yuan. Mr. Pu Qiting, sympathizing with children who have dropped out of school, donated a wrinkled gauze-faced camel down robe and a woolen gabardine coat, entrusting them to be sold for charity to help the scholarship. All of these familiar situations show the highest compassion of mankind. It is hoped that those with power in society will continue to respond, donate generously, and be fortunate, be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Highlights Among Highlights <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>As the National Government's participation in the war enters its second year, Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] elucidates the key points of policy implementation, declaring that this year will focus on the production increase campaign as the most important among priorities. The current production increase policy targets two major goals: supporting the electricity supply and supporting the people's livelihood. This demonstrates Chairman Chiang's simultaneous assessment of the current situation and deep understanding of the nation's circumstances, aiming to achieve both supporting the people and supporting the war effort. Looking around the world at countries participating in the war, very few are able to simultaneously support the people and the war effort. Even in the case of the United States, which is known as the wealthiest country in the world, its agricultural production capacity has already been largely taken over by its military industry in the past two years, resulting in a gradual reduction of civilian material rations due to the decline in domestic agricultural production, which serves as clear evidence.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to simultaneously support the people and the war effort? This is a self-evident principle in wartime, and there is no need to explain it further. However, increasing production is the only way to support both the people and the war effort. Among the urgent tasks in the production increase process, as Chairman Chiang stated, are the development of arable land, the improvement of agricultural technology, the establishment of a core group of farmers, and the revival of light industries most closely related to clothing and food. In that case, we feel that "governing lies not in excessive words, but in vigorous action." Starting from the second year of the National Government's participation in the war, we should strive to transform previous rhetoric about production increase into actual facts of increased production. At the very least, we must not regress and allow production to shrink, leading the people's clothing and food problem to a dead end. This would cause those dedicating themselves to the front lines to worry daily about the livelihood of their parents, siblings, wives, and children. It would also mean that those willing to serve in the rear would be unable to secure even basic sustenance, ultimately leading to a failure to support the war effort due to a failure to support the people. This has been repeatedly discussed in the past year. The present plan aims to awaken public attention and especially emphasizes the promotion of agricultural production, which reflects this intention.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth - Gold of Perfect Fineness - Market Rumors of Devaluation Are Absolutely Untrustworthy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank of China's Shanghai branch has already begun payments for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign currency. Those receiving gold dollars are quite enthusiastic. The gold bars are of perfect fineness, and the payment process is very efficient, which has greatly satisfied the recipients. Recently, rumors have circulated in the market claiming that the gold bars are not of sufficient fineness and are of lower value than gold bars circulating in Shanghai. These rumors are intended to serve the private interests of those seeking to buy at a devalued price. It is hoped that the general public will not be deceived. In order to assist in strengthening the credit of Central Reserve Bank notes and to implement the low-price policy, a large batch of gold is being continuously shipped to Shanghai and handed over to the Central Reserve Bank for the purpose of contracting the currency and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>The Business Coordination Committee convened a board of directors meeting, deciding to hold it on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>The National General Association of Business Controls, in order to meet the needs of the citizens, has decided to expedite the allocation of cotton cloth as much as possible and has sent special envoys to the capital to request instructions and determine the date of commencement of the allocation. It is reported that the association will hold its eleventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month to discuss all relevant matters concerning the control of essential civilian goods.</p>

<p>Chinese Stocks Stop Falling and Rise - New Pharmaceutical Stocks See Buying Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks subsided and turned upward. This was because there was no shortage of funds as seen last week, and more investors gradually bottomed out. However, after three consecutive days of decline, some lingering effects were unavoidable. After opening higher in the morning, the market once fell back down, but starting at noon, it slowly climbed up again. In the end, stocks in most industries rose. The pharmaceutical sector was the strongest, with New Asia Pharmaceutical once exceeding the 40-yuan mark and Sino-French reaching 82 yuan. However, due to the excessive rise, prices retreated slightly. Nevertheless, the rise was still the most significant. In the department store sector, China Products Company rose 7 yuan. Wing On was the focus of attention during the evening close due to organized buying. Textile mills such as Wing On saw price increases of several yuan, with Rongfeng reaching beyond 80 yuan. In the cultural sector, Shanghai Book Company also saw an increase. China Film rose significantly. In the chemical industry, Dada reached the highest price of the day at closing. Kangyuan Manufacturing saw a price increase, and Yongxing reached beyond 40 yuan. Investment stocks such as Sanye and Liya also rose sharply. New Asia Construction and other companies are already in progress. Trading is becoming more active. The final closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e33">Commemorative Meeting for War Participation - Mayor Chen's Address <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from page 3 yesterday)</p>
<p>On November 6th last year, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued on the last day of the Greater East Asia Conference, marking the guiding principles for the construction of East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity based on morality. The nations of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's autonomy and independence and strive for mutual assistance and harmony to establish the amity of Greater East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation to promote the culture of Greater East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia shall promote their economic development and enhance the prosperity of Greater East Asia based on reciprocity and close cooperation. The nations of Greater East Asia shall enhance friendship with all nations, eliminate racial discrimination, widely communicate cultures, and further open up resources to contribute to the progress of the world. The issuance of this declaration and outline proves that the nations of Greater East Asia are uniting on the basis of their respective independence to build a new, free, and independent Greater East Asia. In this way, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has not only been achieved but has also been ensured. The purpose of our participation in the war has been achieved and ensured. However, the battles on the battlefield have not yet been completed. Therefore, on the anniversary of our participation in the war, we should review the past and encourage the future. We should further encourage our people and increase our strength on this anniversary.</p>
<p>Today, I would also like to address Shanghai officials and Shanghai residents. In the past year of participation in the war, the concessions in China, whether exclusively administered or public, have been recovered, and extraterritorial rights in China have also been abolished. Although many outstanding procedures are still in progress, the unequal treaties that once bound China have been completely abolished. However, we must not think that this is our achievement; it is merely a process of China achieving freedom and independence, and it is merely an expression of China and Japan sharing weal and woe and living and dying together. In reality, our true achievements lie in our ability to contribute manpower to the front lines, work hard in battle, increase production in the rear, and ensure security. Therefore, our more than ten million overseas Chinese compatriots in various locations in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Java, and other places on the front lines should work harder to assist Japan, our ally, and our fellow Greater East Asians in these locations in their efforts. They should also assist the free government of Free India in its struggle. The victory on the battlefield will not stop until it is achieved, and the purpose of the war will not stop until it is achieved. We also have hundreds of millions of compatriots who are urgently striving to complete liberation as the backing for our overseas Chinese compatriots. We are also constantly preparing to go to the front lines as a backup for our allies. Furthermore, our compatriots in the rear should work even harder to increase production and ensure security. During the past year of war participation, although we have made much progress, we have also discovered shortcomings that urgently need to be addressed. We have noticed a clear decline in Shanghai's production. Perhaps this is due to the high cost of raw materials affecting production, or perhaps it is due to a lack of raw materials affecting production. More recently, the reduction in fuel has also affected production. These situations are, of course, unavoidable phenomena during wartime. However, these situations must be resolved during wartime. Resolving these problems is certainly the responsibility of the government, but it is also the joint responsibility of the people. No matter what, we must overcome this difficulty and solve this problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the security in Shanghai has improved compared to the past few years, we cannot be satisfied. By security, I do not mean just the security within the city but also the general security within and outside the city under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. The baojia system and the police within Shanghai have worked hard to strive for security, for which I should be grateful. The security teams, police brigades, police officers, and other units that have assisted us in clearing the countryside outside Shanghai have worked hard to strive for security, for which I should also be grateful. However, the clearing of the countryside in Shanghai has reached the second phase, and the third clearing area also began last December. I believe there are still shortcomings in general security. While protecting security is the responsibility of the government, mutual assistance and support are also the responsibility of the general public. I hope that everyone understands, based on the great significance of the Greater East Asia War and the great significance of China's freedom and independence, that the military and the people should work together to ensure the security of the rear. Shanghai is in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and I believe that all unnatural facts must be eliminated, and all contradictory facts must be eliminated. As a result of the review in the past year of war participation, we must make progress where we have made progress, and we must remedy the shortcomings. In this way, we can ensure the purpose of the war and ensure the purpose of freedom and independence.</p>
<p>Today is also Shanghai's Civil Defense Day. I have already prepared further broadcasts. Today, at the commemorative meeting, I would like to solemnly tell everyone that in wartime, especially in today's era of three-dimensional warfare, we cannot be overly optimistic about air raids. When an air raid truly comes, we also do not need to panic because this is an inevitable fact in war. Regarding the existence of this fact, first, we must eliminate it, and second, we must defend against it. Shanghai is our rear area, and Shanghai is our economic center. In our expectations, the enemy must disrupt us. If we speculate that Shanghai will not be attacked by air, that is a mistake. If we speculate that even if Shanghai is attacked by air, it will not be serious, that is also a mistake. We must have full preparations to cope with unexpected changes. Therefore, we have established the Civil Defense Headquarters and designated Civil Defense Day. I hope that all compatriots will understand this significance. Everyone should not be negligent, and everyone should not slack off. I have found that the compatriots in Shanghai are too optimistic and casual about civil defense. When there is nothing happening, they are too casual, and when something happens, they will inevitably be too chaotic. I cannot bear to see everyone's laxity today, and especially I cannot bear to see everyone's helplessness in the future. Therefore, I especially want to draw everyone's attention at this commemorative meeting and anniversary. Ladies and gentlemen, civil defense is a part of the war effort, and it is also the most important work to protect production and ensure security. Let us unite as officials and people, work hard together, and welcome the victory of the Greater East Asia War. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Promoting the Use of Native Yarn <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shuxun</p>
<p>Since the Business Coordination Committee implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth, the prices of raw cotton in the interior and the prices of finished products have moved in opposite directions, and it is true that rural farmers are unwilling to sell raw cotton. However, based on the current market price in Jiading, farmers sell one catty of raw cotton (market price is 30 yuan, while the cotton coordination committee's price for local cotton is only 26 yuan, plus a fee for the public treasury) and exchange it for an equivalent amount of 16-count yarn, with each yarn costing 110 yuan, totaling 220 yuan. The difference between them reaches 190 yuan, and rural farmers are really unable to bear the exploitation by middlemen and transportation costs! Recently, farmers in various parts of Jiading, with the autumn harvest over and nothing to do in their spare time, have been busy sorting out the old work from 30 years ago, which is the spinning of native yarn. Currently, the price of native yarn is about 60 yuan per catty, which is a huge 160 yuan cheaper than an equivalent amount of factory yarn. While the government is promoting a savings campaign and encouraging the production of native yarn and cloth, it is a small supplement to the rural economy. Then, the difficult challenge comes: each trade in the Jiading district can collect about 10 dan of native yarn per day, which is equivalent to about two pieces of factory yarn. The outlet for it on a monthly basis is also a problem. The local wooden weaving machines are only one and a half feet wide and really do not meet the needs of the modern era, and transporting them is also seen as a difficult road. It would be best if Shanghai's manufacturers could cooperate and try to handle this. In the midst of the scarcity of raw materials, they could modernize the weaving and dyeing of native yarn to provide clothing for workers, soldiers, and farmers, which would greatly help the national economic life.</p>
