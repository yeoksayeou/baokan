<p>社評</p>
<h3>提高中小學教室待遇</h3>
<p>本報四月二十八日社評提出「重視罷教風潮」問題，因為教室生活，受若干唯利是圖的學店老闆所剝削而不能安定，於是怠忽職務，甚至發生罷教風潮，這是上海教育問題中最嚴重的危機。我們主張各私立學校，對於財政收支，必須公開，收之於學生者，用之於敎職員及學校設備，不應坐肥私囊。同時，敎育當局應以公正態度，嚴密監督與審核私立學校的財政收支，並督促公開發表。如有不合理事實，即應從嚴取締。並盼社會人士加以檢舉與制裁。</p>
<p>上海本來是全國文化的中心，學校數量佔全國首位，自從民二十六年以後，上海附近各縣的中小學校，相率遷移來滬的，為數更不少，就數量上說，上海的學校，反而增加了，由於年來物價高漲，生活艱苦，影響於敎育方面者，便是有經騐有學識的敎育工作人員，捨棄敎育本位工作而從事他業；同時，有不少原非敎育工作人員，或雖是敎育工作人員而無服務志願者，則以敎育事業為營利工具，利用種種名義開創或接辦各級學校，目的只在營利，對於敎育的使命毫未顧到。最顯著的表現，是收入學費盡量提高，支出敎職員薪費朋盡量抑低。這樣的畸形發展，學校數量愈多，敎育素質愈低而愈紊亂</p>
<p>質直的說，敎師待遇的適當與否與敎育成效的優良與否，成為正比例的。敎師的待遇適當，生活女定，自然能够孜孜兀兀，誨人不倦，敎育的成效自然優良。本來，為敎師者，曾受相當敎育，充分瞭解服務敎育的意義，具備服務敎育的志願，更知忍受服務敎育的淸苦。所以，對於生活上的待遇，並不追求過分享受的慾望，能够得到最低限度的安定，巳經滿足·如果，並最低限度的生活安定而無法獲得，必期吃的是草而榨的是乳，自亦戞戞乎難了。怎樣是敎師的最低限度的生活呢？至少要維持「吃飽穿暖」的標準。</p>
<p>其次，中國對於師道之尊敬，自古極為隆崇·時至今日，為人師表，而生活不繼，大都是「面有菜色，腹無滴汕」。就尊師之道而言，也是不合理的。</p>
<p>敎育是百年樹人的根木大計，敎師是推進敎育的動力。所以，今日的敎師生活必須澈底改善，務期獲得最低限度的安定，尤其是中小學敎師數量更為普遍。私立中小學部分，我們前巳主張財政公開，取之學生者，用之於敎師。至於市立學校，學費較廉，收入較差，惟賴政府經費，不敷支出·一方面應請政府酌加經費，一方面盼望學生家長中資力較强者，自動量力資助，幫助改善敎師生活，就是尊崇師道，相信家長們為子弟敎育成就設想，也必樂為。頃聞本市市政府曁社會福利當局巳經注意及此，領導發動。改善中小學敎師待遇。願學校當局曁社會各界共同促成，敎師生活之幸，就是敎育前途之幸。</p>
<h3>汪主席近日誕辰　中樞慶祝禮　全國各團體粉電領袖致敬</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　和平遝動之發　，瞬逾四年，我最高領袖策劃國是，日理萬機，傾其心力於東亞新秩序，以至於世界新秩序之建設。四年以來，已奠定復興中華，保衛東亞之基礎，領袖此種宵　勤勞救國救民之精神，舉國朝野靡不深為感戴，而益堅和運必成，東亞復興之信念。惟數年來，領袖由於公忠謀國心力交瘁，以致政躬違和，然自易地療養以後，健康巳逐漸恢復，此實不僅中國之福，誠亦東亞之幸，世界之幸。茲者本年五月四日，恭逢領袖華誕之期，中樞及省市地方官民，日來紛紛函電祝賀，並舉行遙拜儀禮，以示崇敬，盟友各邦亦馳電祝賀，具見舉國擁戴，薄海推崇之摯情。</p>

<h3>平漢綫發動新攻勢　日軍佔領鄭州許昌　突破渝軍第一綫防衛陣地</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日大營三日下午三時二十分發表：華北方面日軍部隊，於四月十八日渡過黃河及新黃河，對重慶直系湯恩伯軍展開進攻作戰，於四月二十日及五月一日，相繼佔領鄭州及許昌，刻繼續進擊中。</p>
<p>河南前綫某基地三日中央社電　日軍於上月二十八日拂曉，在新黃河對岸中平附近渡河，猛攻渝軍左翼，日軍別動隊與之策應，於八日晨集合於新黃河東北岸傅莊，於砲兵部隊掩護下，分乘舟艇出擊，渡過幅闊約五百米之急湍河流，潮湧進學。當抵達對岸時，急追敗走渝軍，進迫平漢路之要衝新鄭，二十日夜半。日軍某部隊在新鄭南方二公里之某地，構築陣地。二十一日拂曉，第一陣新軍先鋒部隊，以猛烈砲火攻擊渝軍第二十八集團軍，新編第十五軍，新編第二十九師（師畏呂公良）之一團，約一千兵力，獨立第十四旅一團，及其他約五千渝軍。下午四時，即突入城內，六時完全佔領新鄭。</p>
<p>開封三日中央社電　渝方近曾誤認日本從中國抽調兵力赴南方前綫，乃力言對日軍發動總反攻，並曾積極從事戰力之充實與整備，以謀奪回華北，但經日華北派遣軍於四月十八日，以卓越之機動力，及至妙之戰術，猛攻將直系軍，第一戰區蔣鼎文指揮下之四十剩師約四十萬人後，渝軍即因此而大感狼狽。日軍自作戰以來，不出旬日，即已突破渝軍第一綫防衛陣地。緣此次之河南作戰，實為中原會戰以來所僅見者，常此次發動作戰時，國府軍隊亦曾予以協力，河南平原及山岳地帶，展開一大殲滅戰。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　華北方面日軍，於四月十八日，向豫皖兩省平原之渝第一戰區副司令湯恩伯軍，開始進攻，瞬即佔平英各之之要衝鄭州及滸昌，刻正繼續進攻中‘當茲日軍於伊姆法爾要塞，包圍英第地軍加以重創之時，日軍再度先發制敵，南北同時發動二大主要攻勢，足證日軍戰力之精強，將使渝方及反軸心軍方面，大感　異。湯恩作係豫省渝軍第一站去副司令官，司時為配備於平漢路新黃河中間地區之渝第十九集團軍司令官，最近更兼任豫魯邊區司令官，其軍中之鐵軍。日軍比次於四月十七日夜間，及十八日拂曉，一路由中　附近，一路由鄭州北方地區奇襲，渡過黃河及新黃河開始進擊。旋即攻破渝軍之抵抗陣錢，捷速進擊黃河之沙漠地帶。二十日即佔領鄭州，五月一日更佔領鄭州南方七十公里之許昌，刻正繼續破竹進擊。同時日航空部隊更緊密協力地上作戰，並連日空襲漢中實　盧氏西安興安等地渝空軍基地，獲莫大戰果。渝軍因日軍於去年一年間迭次發動進攻，（按去年一年間與渝軍交戰次數約二萬二千此，一月平均約一千剩次，一日平均約七十次），因在人力物力上均蒙極大損耗，故去年後半期以來，曾採用所謂保存兵力主義，更深恐日軍學潰其殘存兵力，退避於第一綫後方，以期極力保存其戰力。然自本年初期以來，渝軍因美國之煽動工作而頓現活躍，最近更利用由渝印空輸路運來之美國武器，從事改編部隊，復藉美駐渝空軍之勢力，企圖對日發動攻勢。但日軍為預先壓制其蠢動企圖，曾發動主導攻勢，早已予渝軍以極大打擊，渝軍當局亦認日軍之進擊目標，在於打擊重慶而極形　怖云。</p>
<h3>松島部長　在杭發表演說　實行航空機增產</h3>
<p>中央社三日杭州電　日駐華艦隊報道部長松島少佐，於三日在此間中華大戲院出席軍用機資金獻納海軍演講會，就大東亞戰爭現階段實况，發表演說，大要如次：雄大無比之大東亞戰爭，如僅就局部觀察，實難以下正鵠判斷。目前我軍在南太平洋方面，制止敵軍猛烈之反攻，力取守勢。反之在印緬國境方面，則發輝旺盛之攻學力，擊碎印度國內之央美勢力。又在中國方面，亦逐次破碎敵方之謀略。由上而觀，可謂大東亞戰爭之現階段，實係採取東守西攻之戰勢。然大東亞戰爭之命運，實際仍繫於太平洋，太平洋方而若能制勝，則大東亞戰爭必可完成。然何以我軍目前在此方面採取守勢，此點盜余已數度言及，實受航空兵力不甚充分之影響，尤以航空機之數量不及敵人，我方對此早已加以注意，目下業已樹立航空極大增產計劃，舉國一致，邁力推進，不出數月，我方之航空兵力，至少當可與太平洋之敵方兵力並駕齊驅，發　精悍　力，猛然採取攻勢也。敵美國察知我方如此充實戰力，乃力圖在此項計劃未利戰鬥，因此在太平洋方戰屢敗，竟無法接近我本土一步，由此可知目前實為完成大東亞戰爭之極重要時期，如有一步失足，即可使全般戰局一蹶不振。反之，如能衝破此關，則勝利必屬於我，故航空機之增產，實較任何為緊要云。</p>
<h3>海部明日起檢閱全國海軍</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　海軍部定五日起，開始檢閱全國海軍。任部長已於昨日下午，偕同高級將校等十餘員赴滬，決定依次檢閱上海中央海軍學校，及練兵營測量局，並駐泊上海港內之海兵等各艦艇。又中央海校學生將付畢業禮，任部長　汪委昌長命，代表致訓。</p>
<h3>日帝大古武教授完成超荷爾蒙劑對戰士健康可發揮奇效</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電「航空病」及「潛水病」，為航空人員及潛水將兵引為最可佈之病症，為救濟患者脫出危險，世界列强均在銳意硏究，爭先發見適切之方法，然迄今未獲任何結論，惟知以食料之精質補養而巳。日大阪帝大名譽教授古武彌國郞博士，為著名於世界之荷爾蒙硏究家，最近已完成超强力荷爾　劑特力蒙，據稱：特力蒙對於特殊戰鬥員之健康發揮奇效。凡　疾結核等不治之疾，皆可藉此劑而根絕，對於人體復無弊害，一日服用十克。即足以支持多時，現醫科各大學正積極研究中。</p>
<h3>青少年總檢　昨舉行入營式　上午全體謁陵致敬</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電　全國靑少年第二次總檢閱大露營，於三日晨七時，在中國靑年館體育塲舉行入營式。由大會林會長領導舉行，計到有大會各高級職員，及參與露營之各地靑少年，日·滿·德·泰·印·菲·緬·等各國代表等千剩人。七時正，入營式在全體肅立音樂鏗鏘聲中開始，靑天白日滿地紅國旗，遂在全體肅穆敬禮軍樂伴奏聲中冉冉上升，旋即全體高呼，恭祝領袖健康，繼由會長致歡迎詞。詞畢，即舉行入營典禮。首由會長與全體相對行敬禮，繼由全體中國靑少年與友邦靑少年相對行敬禮，旋全體合唱中國青少年團團歌，入營式至此遂在軍樂聲重禮成。禮成後林會長步下檢閱臺，與各國代表個別握手為禮。休息後，至九時正，全體在林會長領導下，徒步赴國父陵園謁陵　致敬。於十時半抵達陵寢，略事休息後，謁陵式由林會長領導舉行。謁陵式在全體肅立軍樂聲中開始，向國父遺像行最敬禮三鞠躬。繼由林會長恭續國父遣嘱，俯首默念畢，由大會會長代表全體，恭獻花圈，全體靑少年肅立致敬。獻花後全體角　進入靈堂，繞靈堂一周，瞻仰國父遺容後，謁陵式遂告完畢。全體又在林會長率領下，赴靈谷寺致祭國民革命先烈靈位，及光明殿致祭援助中國革命日太同志靈　儀式。</p>
<h3>袁履登抵京</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　米糧統制委員會主任委員哀履登，昨日滬晋京。聞袁氏此行，目的為向中樞有關當局商討今後全國之米糧收購統配等事。</p>
<h3>糧部併入實部人事略有更動</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　自糧食部正式併入實業部以後，該部即將所有增產及行政工作，就原有部門分別辦理。茲為實施行政簡素化，對於人事機　，亦稍有更動。原任農林署署長陳燕山，兼任中央農業實騐所所長，原任　林處處長沈壽鈴，調任中央農業實騐所副所長，遺缺由邵仲香充任。農業經騐處畏改由周封　充任，劉煒俊改任水產管理局局長。麥靜銘任保險監理局長，勞蔭予任商品檢騐局長，王秉眞任商標局長。又關於前糧食部掌管漁牧事業，該部改於農林署內增設之一科或二科，專司其事。至原糧食部所主管之農業改進區，總經理處辦理之增產事宜，則擬另設視察局。至主管人選，刻正作愼重銓衡中。</p>

<h3>日印軍待機進攻　廸馬普爾將決戰　哥希馬北方敵反攻被擊退</h3>
<p>印緬前綫三日中央社電　伊姆法爾方面日。印軍對迪馬普爾公路上英·印軍之攻擊日為激烈，敵軍現續將迪馬普爾方面有力之機化部隊調至普列馬周圍增援，並以空軍反覆向日。印軍盲炸。同時，更以精銳部隊向某方面及培開庫萊馬北方增援，以期阻止日。印軍之前進，故各方面目前均在激戰中。其中尤以四六　高地周圍之戰事最為激烈，二十八日敵軍於坦克車及迫擊砲之掩護下，向日·印軍陣地後方實施迅速攻擊，然未得逞，由茲布柴方面進攻哥希馬北方之數百敵軍，二十八日薄暮亦被日。印軍擊退，故敵軍反攻之企圖，巳悉被粉粹。同時，固守各戰略要點之日。印軍，現正待機，不久即將進攻迪馬普爾，預料該方面之決戰，亦將於最近展開。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據印度前綫某地電，上月二十五日晚有敵軍約四百人，圖向哥希馬北部五公里之梅雷麥附近秘密蠢動，意欲窺向哥希馬北方，日軍即於是日深夜施行奇襲，將該敵軍擊退。又四六一高地四週之殘敵，獲得砲隊支援，依然據守排砲進攻，但日軍毫不氣餒，分頭將反攻之敵軍擊退。又敵軍在基爾赫麥（哥希馬西北十公里）西方約二十公里附近，近日集結各種戰車三十餘輛，勢欲南下，日軍已確保戰略，每次均將敵軍擊退。</p>
<p>仰光三日中央社電　上月二十五日，日軍於馬尼布爾溪谷上空空戰時地上部隊于轟炸隊掩護下，一鼓擊落敵機十四架，其中有DC3型機六架，是役收得極大戰果，日勇士無不稱快，是日向阿拉坎山脈上空飛行中之日戰鬥機隊，發見自伊姆法爾方面向西南進攻之敵DC3型機四架，即分向敵機進擊，最初敵一機被擊墜，未幾又一機被撞墜地，其後日轟炸隊更向敵戰鬥機羣進擊，其餘二敵機遂乘隙狼狽遁走。日機依計劃飛至拉拉巴薩車站上空，正確投彈，命中軍站中心建築物後，日機安返防地。於歸途中，復與前曾被擊之敵DC3型機一架相遇，立即被日機一擊而命中其要害，使其隊地，是時敵主力機隊自西南方飛到，日機同樣予以射擊，正思歸返原防地時，忽自伊姆法爾方面復飛來一機，依其飛行　態，似為敵空輸路交叉點連路機。日機即由側面去，連發數彈，敵機即中彈墮入山谷中，是役計共擊落敵機十四架，日機全部安返原防。</p>
<h3>中南太平洋各島　日軍迭邀擊敵機　數日間擊落擊毀二十架</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電敵於上月二十六日晨，二十七日晨及三十日晨，分別以大型機四十八架，小型機十九架，來襲波那佩島，特魯克島及美萊庸島，當地日軍邀擊之，結果擊落其戰鬥機等五架，此役日機亦有一架自炸</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　敵機仍頻襲拉巴爾，三十日復有百七十架來襲，經該地守軍部隊擊落基六架，擊毀其五架，日方損害輕微。</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電　上月二十八日，敵機十三架來襲波根維爾島布加地區，該地日軍守備隊常加邀擊，擊洛其兩架。又敵B41型機七架，上月二十八日曾襲新幾內亞，經日戰鬥機擊毀其兩架，日方無損害。</p>
<h3>小磯抵東京　發表談話</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　據福岡電話，日朝鮮總督小磯氏，為向天皇報告政務，日前偕小林，松岡兩秘書官由朝鮮出發，二日下午抵福岡，旋即搭機東上，小磯抵此間時，曾就戰時朝鮮之近狀，發表談話，其大意如次：今日期鮮正舉其人力物力資源，協力大東亞戰爭，其在稻作方面，務須完成二千六百萬石之生產目標（按平時為二千三百三十五萬石），並預算向日內地供出五百萬石至六百萬石，其他雜糧，亦以二千萬石為生產目標，積極推進，一方朝鮮地下資源如煤鐵及輕金屬鑛物質，實用之不竭，現當局正利用豐富之電力，使此等資源化為戰力。</p>

<p>仰光三日中央社電　緬甸政府為加强行政，已決定市政再建之具體方策，除仰光外，全國共設三十一市，市政已確立。</p>
<h3>峇釐一郡長參加防衛軍</h3>
<p>爪加爾達中央社電　爪哇等地原住民，無不協力日軍，積極從事建設，頃竟有捨世襲之高位，而參加防衛義勇軍之佳話。蓋爪哇東方峇釐島有郡長伏特氏，素即協力日軍，率先領導當地住民，從事各種建設，當日軍布告編峇釐防衛義勇軍時，認為獻身擊滅英。美之期巳至，乃不顧其世襲之地位與高邁之年齡，而決意入伍。夫妻携扎面見日軍當局，披瀝壯志，使閱者動容，卒從其願。該氏亦發表談話如次：日軍為吾等之亞洲而奮鬥，吾人得與日軍協力擊滅英·美，實不勝欣快之至，茲以同生共死之信念，分祖防衛鄉里之重任。</p>
<h3>美任命格魯　為東亞部長</h3>
<p>里期本三日中央社電　華盛頓來電：美國務院二日發表：任命前駐日大使格魯為東亞部長。</p>
<h3>西與英美訂協定　中立不受影響　西國主權仍完整無缺</h3>
<p>瑪德里三日中央社電　海通社訊，西班牙外交部昨日發表公報稱：西班牙與英美間關於禁止運油之談判，業已成立協定。該公報之全文稱，「關於西班牙與英美間經濟關係之一切懸案，已於談判簽訂協定，因問題複雜，故談判之時間經過甚久。該協定係根據對西班牙中立國地位與現實之諒解，過去數週來西班牙與英美間之關係一度緊張，現雙方業巳恢復正常之關係，危機之消弭並不妨礙有關國家之利益與威望。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　英美曾對西班牙以停輸煤油及其他各種手段力加壓迫，西元目弗朗哥及外長赫爾得那始終以堅毅態度與之交涉，雖屢逢危機，然因央國所需之黃鐵鑛及鐵等，必須仰賴西班牙輸入，故由於美英兩國之讓步，使交涉始漸近結束階段。德國通信社駐瑪德里特派員曾報稱，　此次交涉因有種種利害關係，故西政府始終愼重處置，其結果西國現仍堅持中立，而其貿易上及政治上之主權毫未受損害，而使英美兩政府交涉停止輸入煤油之事實為外交上之成功，英美兩政府就僑居西班牙領之外人，雖提出不合情理之要求，然西政府始終堅守中立，對交戰各國代表採取平等待遇，於此次之公報中申明尊重中立與關係各國之利益者，顯示對以上主張之貫澈。</p>
<h3>土停輸銘礦事　德極為重視</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　有人詢問巴本大使之回國，是否可以加速關於土耳其對德停輸鉻礦事之調查研究者，德外部發言人稱，現對於德方態度之發表，仍未有確期，德政府對此問題係以完全自主之立塲以資應付，且極重視此項事件。</p>
<h3>英聯邦會議　檢討軍事</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三日中央社電　英聯邦首相會議，二日復於達密市街首相官邸繼續開會，反軸心軍首腦亦均出席。先就歐洲反攻作戰政戰兩略加以檢討，據路透社訊，該會議目前正集中於直接戰事方面，特別關於太平洋戰錢。澳首相寇丁，紐西蘭首相福來薩均開陳意見。</p>
<h3>英相預示大戰將臨</h3>
<p>日內瓦三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，倫敦息：英首相邱吉爾於星期一在自治領會議中發表演說稱，大戰即將達「最危險之頂點」，際此戰事正進入最激烈階段之時，渠並不希望該項會議能完全解決英帝國之一切問題，但舉行圓桌會議以交換見意，此正其時。</p>
<h3>反軸心積極破壞　水陸運輸綫　登陸作戰之前奏</h3>
<p>柏林三日中央社電　法國西北海岸萊因河多瑙河以及其他運輸路，皆為戰略上之重要輸血路，故英機時以大量機雷對之轟炸，此其攻勢與西歐要塞後方運輸路綫之破壞相互呼應，頗有進攻作戰即將開始之兆，軍事專家亦甚關心今後進展。英法海峽至比斯開灣一帶德軍之哨戒掃海部隊，自三月上旬以來，淸掃敵機雷之數，實達過去之三倍，此項事實乃證明在大戰開端前，敵方巳開始阻礙海上運輸船團之行動，並謀掌握作戰重點之主動性。而德軍掃海部隊則安然將此機雷完全炸破，德方之突破船探索艇驅逐艇等，業將敵方之企圖粉碎。</p>
<h3>機雷設計日新越累</h3>
<p>自開戰以來，英德機雷專家粉忙於硏究製造機雷及其防禦武器，英美現在所有之機雷，多為磁性機雷，其感應性極强，與前之接觸機雷不同，即使鐵綫通過，其磁性表面亦能立即爆炸。開戰當初，此種磁性機雷多為固定式，置於海底，現在則進步為輕易式，亦即利用機雷之浮力，可繫留於永中。磁性機雷之感應震度僅四十餘辮，此種輕易式出現後，敷設置水域頓形擴大，機雷之設計日益巧妙，防禦武器以及取除之方法亦隨之月異日新。在侵歐作戰之準備期中，德掃海部隊所掃除之接觸機雷，僅為全書百分之二，其餘均係危險已之極磁性輕便機雷。此種機雷之撤播方法，則全利用大型飛機夜間實行。敵軍機雷數設機之搭載量，據稱一機可載六百至一千公斤之機雷四個乃至六個。</p>
<p>比沿疏散居民</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　德當局對於應付反軸心軍之發動侵歐，業已有萬全之準備。據比利時通信社二日訊，德佔領地軍當局巳在比利時海岸地帶之一般市鎭，發出撤退令，故布蘇堪貝爾古及諾開兩市之住民，均向東部布朗達斯遷移。</p>
<h3>密西西比河水氾濫　災區面積百五十萬英畝</h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據海通社訊，聖路易息：美國密西西比河及其支流伊利諾斯河及密蘇里河泛濫成災，美國紅十字會估計淪為澤國之土地，不下一百五十萬英畝。美陸軍工程師昨晚稱，聖路易以南九十五英里處，一段長約三十哩之堤岸，有被衝破之危，大水淹沒之區一望濁流，房屋僅露屋頂。</p>
<h3>美美的石油爭奪戰</h3>
<p>「美國的石油，今後約十二年就要枯竭了。」這是美國內政部長兼戰時燃料局長官伊克斯在去年所說的話，當時在專門家之間，關於這語言的當否，議論粉粉，莫哀一是。現在美國得石油生產，在世界的總生產量上所占的比率頗高。這總生產與前次大戰時的躍增情形比較起來，則其上昇率甚為緩慢。現在的世界總生產額，每年姑以三億噸計，美國的生產約為六〇％。美國藉口石油增產的不振，乃以為向生產的石油一切國家　劃，視為當然，而最被注意者，實為英國。當伊克斯發出上述警告時曾說：「　量利用他國的石油，美國自身的石油，必須極力節約。」可見其意所指的何在。況且此次大戰實是從生產石油的重要舞臺上趕走英國的絕好機會。特別在西亞，二者之間已經暗鬥了很久，其結果對英國漸見不利。在巴倫諸島（波斯灣內），美國早已有廿九家公司獲得採油權，在阿拉伯及科威德，也巳有卅九家公司獲得同樣利權。</p>
<p>瑛姑的油庫－巴倫</p>
<p>巴倫約石油生產額，一九三五年度為四千噸，至一九四〇年度躍增至百萬噸。原來巴倫這地方，因其石油，並其戰略的地位，而為英海軍特別重視。石油用海底輸油管運至英海軍重要基地梅那瑪港。巴倫不僅以石油供給亞丁。孟買。錫蘭等地的英海軍，而且遠至澳洲的達爾文港及悉尼港。此次大戰勃發之前，英國令美系的德士古公司參加巴倫的石油，敷衍一時，而得以防止美國勢力進出該方面。但後來德士古公司的利權被美國別的大公司收買之後，美國派遣軍隊至巴倫，於是英國的喪失巴倫，乃是勢所必至的了。</p>
<p>一九三三年，加利福尼亞－阿拉伯。美孚石油公司，曾在沙地·阿拉伯從國王伊逢·莎特那裏獲得四十萬平方公里油田地帶的利權，三年之後，即巳從事大量採掘石油，其生產量在一九三六年僅二千噸，至一九四一年達八十萬噸。於是該地的石油貯藏量已達四千萬噸。而且新油田陸續發見，所以沙地。阿拉伯今後將為世界唯一的石油生產國家。</p>
<p>英國被美趕出伊朗</p>
<p>美國政府最近創設以伊克斯為總裁的石油貯藏公司，此舉當然在企圖海外的石油資源，美海軍且也極力支持這政策。伊克斯說：</p>
<p>「美國的參加開發海外石油資源，乃是為了確保將來美國及其與國所必要的石油之絕對要求。」</p>
<p>這種要求的對象，主要的當然是英國。前次上院的陶爾曼委員會曾說：美國要求開發在一九三四年業巳生產石油一千萬噸的伊朗油田，及參加開發同樣的美國原料資源，作為武器租借法所供給物資的代價。</p>
<p>一九四一年，英國派遣有力軍隊赴伊朗，但不久蘇聯亦進駐該國，關於彼此的勢力範圍，據稱有所諒解，現在又加上一個美國。伊朗政府內的美國財政顧問謝里登，事實上可以左右政府，這證明英國已喪失了三十年來在該國所保持的重要地位。</p>
<p>伊朗的石油，向來英國得其五分之四，這佔英國一年消費量三千萬噸中的百分之二十七。由此可知伊朗對英國是怎樣的重要。據說美國用一億五千萬元的預算敷設從沙地。阿拉伯到海岸的輸油管，國王伊蓬莎特對這美國的要求將無法可想罷。關於開發土耳其的石油資源，最近美國也對土要求生產量美土各半，而以敷設從油田地帶到南阿那托利亞的梅隆那的輪油管為條件，要求許可，但遵土國拒絕。</p>
<p>非洲亦被垂涎</p>
<p>非洲現在並不能生產足夠自己需要的石油量。埃及在一九三九年生產六十三萬一千噸，現超過百萬噸，為該方面最重要的石油生產國。英國在該國的地位，曾稱穩固，但美國的商人們，早已下手，獲得相當成功。且美國不僅垂涎西亞的石油，加拿大的石油工業，亦逐漸投資美加二國間，關於開發福特。諾曼間油田的交涉，巳經成立，試掘結果，每日有一百三十七噸。這石油今後將用二根輸油管供給駐屯阿拉斯加的美軍。</p>
<p>美國更想支配南美的石油。美國僅剩餘二百五十萬噸，所以對於有二千五百萬噸輸出力的南美，自然不會放過。一九四〇年」佔領托利尼達特島後，美國即以英國為犧牲而確立之地盤，此後其地位一天天强化起來。這樣，美國一步一步逼近英國，而達到掌握世界石油生產的　禮，這現在是極明顯的事實了。（翅：譯自四月十二日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>谷大使的期待</h3>
<p>日駐華谷大使昨在滬接見記者團時發表談話，特別期待上海的革新。並謂上海工業之復興，芷在鼾究中。日前陳市畏在市政諮詢會致詞中說：「有經濟則有上海，無經濟則無上海。經濟問題不能解決，即是上海一般問題不能解決」。</p>
<p>我們很同意陳市長的論斷，而目前上海經濟問題中，工業生產之萎縮，各工廠的開工率，竟不及平時十分之一，在增加生產定為國策聲中，實為難於理解的問題。如言動力困難，則娛樂塲所，仍可電炬輝煌，而醫院用電，工廠用電同樣限制。在支配方面，極不合理。其次，消極限制終非最妥方法，必須積極疏運燃料。</p>
<p>有人主張華中開發煤礦，固然是治本之道，但目前緩不濟急。煤斤問題，不僅關係工業動力，同時關係民生燃料，同樣重要。我們主張　大量雇用帆船，往靑島海州等地輪運煤斤來滬。希望有關當局及企業家們共同促成。　火車旅客可以減少或間數日停運一次，　出車輛專運煤斤。因為目前旅客中最多的並不是有旅行目的而是跑單幫者，根本不是火車的正常主顧。</p>
<p>谷大使對於上海革新，頗加期待。可是，目前僅為革新的發軔，全面成效，尙待加緊努力。</p>

<h3>修羅（三）</h3>
<p>— 岩田　洪　洋譯</p>
<p>那位靑年，就是牟田口隆夫。就是從　島山溫泉突然宣告失踪的隆夫。</p>
<p>在只淸楚看見天河的黑暗這路上，他低着頭一個人向前走着。</p>
<p>（悏回公寓去是痛苦的，……）</p>
<p>在三塊　十大小的屋子裏等待他的，並不全是半畫成的畫布和板。也不全是　　的　衫·襪子。松節油等的臭味。一踏進房門口，就有無數毒蛇般的煩悶和憂愁，在等待着他。</p>
<p>從車站到公寓，有一公里。他故意選擇寂靜的道路，多饒幾個灣，使這個距離盡量拖長，而且慢慢地走着。</p>
<p>（唉！我究竟怎麽辦呢）？</p>
<p>這句話在他嘴邊上，已經有半年以上了。無論是白天，也無論夜裏，在他腦海中需要解決者，是非常的多。他的面孔比他的年齡顧得特別老者，東京的生活苦固然是一個原因，但煩悶與苦憫的影響，部是一個更大的原因。</p>
<p>（我是抱着的志向來東京的，結果反而無辦法）。</p>
<p>是的。他在霧島硫黃谷溫泉打晉京準備的行李時，整個的心，全身的細胞，全都被强烈的希望火炎在燃燒着。他像一個火球一樣，在空中飛到東京來了。</p>
<p>那就是修福之火。就是因投老海軍經理學校檢騐體格落榜的怨氣，移到他內心來燃燒的野火。是憤怒，怨恨，反抗的烈火。</p>
<p>薩摩出身的這位有志靑年，對於無形的命運所作的祖咒，偵是令人悲憫。他對於「海軍」，是生氣而且怨恨。把自巳想當指揮官，主計科士官，艦上服務員的深切願望完全推翻了的「海軍」，抱着絕頂的怨聲與怒氣。</p>
<p>（好，你這樣討厭我……）</p>
<p>他認為「海軍」討厭他。他認為與一生最茨慕的「海軍」，永遠斷絕關係了。於是，與愛慕「海軍」那樣同一大小的程度，而發生了憤怒的烈火。他本身也努力走向討厭「海軍」的道路。</p>
<p>（我巳經成為與「海軍」頂無緣的人了）。</p>
<p>遠在未去霧島溫泉之前，他就這樣下了決心。當時並未想出走到東京，而想返回家鄉。</p>
<p>（不願看到軍人組同學的面孔。不願看見偵人一類的海軍學生的面孔）？</p>

<h3>Increasing the Salaries of Primary and Secondary School Teachers</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's editorial on April 28th raised the issue of "Attention to the Teacher Strike Trend" because the lives of teachers are unstable due to exploitation by some profit-seeking school owners, which leads to negligence of duty and even teacher strikes. This is the most serious crisis in Shanghai's education problem. We advocate that all private schools must disclose their financial income and expenditure. The money collected from students should be used for teachers' salaries and school equipment, and should not be pocketed privately. At the same time, the education authorities should supervise and audit the financial income and expenditure of private schools in a fair manner, and urge them to publish it publicly. If there are unreasonable facts, they should be strictly investigated and punished. We also hope that people from all walks of life will report and sanction them.</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally the cultural center of the country, with the largest number of schools in the country. Since 1937, many primary and secondary schools in the counties near Shanghai have moved to Shanghai, and the number has increased even more. In terms of quantity, the number of schools in Shanghai has actually increased. Due to the rising prices and difficult living conditions in recent years, the impact on education is that experienced and knowledgeable educators abandon their original educational work and engage in other industries; at the same time, there are many people who were not originally educators, or even if they are educators but have no desire to serve, use education as a tool for profit, and create or take over schools at all levels in various names. Their purpose is only to make profit, and they do not care about the mission of education at all. The most obvious manifestation is to increase tuition fees as much as possible and to suppress teachers' salaries as much as possible. With such abnormal development, the more schools there are, the lower and more chaotic the quality of education will be.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, whether the teachers' salaries are appropriate is directly proportional to the quality of education. If the teachers' salaries are appropriate and their lives are stable, they will naturally be able to work diligently and tirelessly, and the quality of education will naturally be excellent. Originally, teachers have received considerable education, fully understand the meaning of serving education, have the desire to serve education, and know how to endure the hardship of serving education. Therefore, they do not pursue excessive enjoyment in terms of living treatment, and are satisfied if they can obtain the minimum stability. If even the minimum stability of life cannot be obtained, and they are expected to eat grass and squeeze out milk, it will naturally be difficult. What is the minimum standard of living for teachers? At least it must maintain the standard of "eating enough and dressing warmly."</p>
<p>Secondly, China has always respected teachers since ancient times. Today, as role models for others, their lives are unsustainable, and most of them are "pale and empty-bellied." In terms of respecting teachers, it is also unreasonable.</p>
<p>Education is a fundamental plan for nurturing talents for a hundred years, and teachers are the driving force for promoting education. Therefore, the lives of teachers today must be thoroughly improved to ensure that they obtain the minimum stability, especially the number of primary and secondary school teachers is more common. For private primary and secondary schools, we have previously advocated financial transparency, and the money collected from students should be used for teachers. As for municipal schools, tuition fees are lower and income is worse, relying solely on government funding, which is not enough to cover expenses. On the one hand, the government should be asked to increase funding appropriately, and on the other hand, it is hoped that parents of students with strong financial resources will voluntarily provide assistance to help improve the lives of teachers, which is to respect teachers. I believe that parents will be happy to do so for the sake of their children's educational achievements. Recently, I heard that the municipal government and social welfare authorities have paid attention to this and led the launch to improve the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers. The happiness of teachers' lives is the happiness of the future of education.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Recent Birthday: Central Celebration Ceremony, National Groups Send Telegrams to the Leader to Pay Tribute</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The peace movement has been launched for more than four years. Our highest leader plans national affairs and works diligently every day, devoting his efforts to the construction of the new order in East Asia and even the new world order. In the past four years, he has laid the foundation for the revival of China and the defense of East Asia. The spirit of the leader's loyalty, diligence, and saving the country and the people is deeply admired by the whole country, and it strengthens the belief that the peace movement will be successful and East Asia will be revived. However, in recent years, the leader has been exhausted due to his public loyalty and concern for the country, which has led to physical discomfort. However, since he went to a different place for recuperation, his health has gradually recovered. This is not only a blessing for China, but also a blessing for East Asia and the world. Now, on May 4th of this year, we respectfully celebrate the leader's birthday. The central, provincial, and municipal local officials and people have sent letters and telegrams to congratulate him, and held remote worship ceremonies to show their respect.

<h3>New Offensive Launched on the Pinghan Railway Line: Japanese Army Occupies Zhengzhou and Xuchang, Breaking Through the First Line of Defense of the Chongqing Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:20 pm on the 3rd: Japanese troops in North China crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River on April 18th and launched an offensive against Tang Enbo's army, a direct descendant of Chongqing. They successively occupied Zhengzhou and Xuchang on April 20th and May 1st and are continuing their attack.</p>
<p>A certain base on the Henan Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At dawn on the 28th of last month, the Japanese army crossed the river near Zhongping on the other side of the New Yellow River and attacked the left wing of the Chongqing army. A separate Japanese army unit coordinated with it and gathered at Fuzhuang on the northeast bank of the New Yellow River on the morning of the 8th. Under the cover of artillery units, they divided into boats and launched an attack, crossing the rapid river about 500 meters wide and rushing to the school. When they arrived on the other side, they chased and defeated the Chongqing army and approached Xinzheng, an important point on the Pinghan Road. At midnight on the 20th, a certain unit of the Japanese army built a position at a certain place two kilometers south of Xinzheng. At dawn on the 21st, the vanguard unit of the first array of the New Army attacked the 28th Army of the Chongqing Army, the newly编第15军, one regiment of the newly編第29师 (师畏吕公良), about 1,000 soldiers, one regiment of the independent 14th Brigade, and about 5,000 other Chongqing troops with fierce artillery fire. At 4:00 pm, they broke into the city and completely occupied Xinzheng at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing side recently mistakenly believed that Japan had withdrawn troops from China to the southern front and strongly advocated launching a general counter-offensive against the Japanese army. They also actively engaged in the replenishment and preparation of combat power in order to recapture North China. However, after the Japanese North China Expeditionary Force launched a fierce attack on April 18th with excellent mobility and superb tactics against the 40-odd divisions of the Jiang Dingwen-commanded 1st War Zone, the Chongqing army was greatly embarrassed. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army has broken through the first line of defense of the Chongqing army in less than ten days. The Henan operation this time is rare since the Central Plains Battle. When this operation was launched, the National Government army also cooperated with it and launched a large annihilation battle in the Henan plain and mountainous area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On April 18th, the Japanese army in North China launched an offensive against Tang Enbo's army, deputy commander of the 1st War Zone of Yuwan, in the plains of Henan and Anhui provinces, and quickly occupied Zhengzhou and Xuchang, important points of Pingying. When the Japanese army was besieging the British army at the Imphal fortress and severely damaged it, the Japanese army once again preemptively launched two major offensives in the north and south at the same time, which proved the strength of the Japanese army's combat power and would greatly surprise the Chongqing side and the anti-Axis army. Tang Enzuo is the first deputy commander of the Chongqing army in Henan Province. He is also the commander of the 19th Army of the Chongqing Army deployed in the middle area of the Pinghan Road New Yellow River. Recently, he also served as the commander of the Yu Lu Border Region. His army is an iron army. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack from near Zhong on the night of April 17th and at dawn on the 18th, and from the northern area of Zhengzhou, crossed the Yellow River and the New Yellow River and began the attack. Immediately, they broke through the Chongqing army's resistance and quickly advanced into the desert area of the Yellow River. On the 20th, they occupied Zhengzhou, and on May 1st, they occupied Xuchang, 70 kilometers south of Zhengzhou, and are continuing to advance. At the same time, the Japanese air force closely cooperated with the ground operations and bombed the Chongqing air force bases in Hanzhong Shilu, Luxi, Xi'an, and Xing'an for days, achieving great results. The Chongqing army suffered great losses in manpower and material resources due to the repeated offensives launched by the Japanese army in the past year (according to the number of battles with the Chongqing army in the past year, about 22,000 times, an average of about 1,000 times a month, and an average of about 70 times a day). Therefore, since the second half of last year, they have adopted the so-called principle of preserving military strength and are even more afraid that the Japanese army will collapse their remaining military strength and retreat to the rear of the first line in order to preserve their combat power as much as possible. However, since the beginning of this year, the Chongqing army has become active due to the instigation of the United States. Recently, it has used American weapons transported by the Chongqing-India air transport route to reorganize its troops and attempted to launch an offensive against Japan by taking advantage of the power of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. However, in order to suppress its attempted rebellion in advance, the Japanese army launched a leading offensive and had already dealt a great blow to the Chongqing army. The Chongqing military authorities also believe that the Japanese army's offensive target is to attack Chongqing and are extremely frightened.</p>
<h3>Minister Matsushima Delivers a Speech in Hangzhou: Implementing Increased Production of Aircraft</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Major Matsushima, Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, attended the Naval Lecture on Funding for Military Aircraft at the China Grand Theater here on the 3rd and delivered a speech on the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, the main points of which are as follows: It is difficult to make a correct judgment on the Greater East Asia War, which is incomparably grand, if only observed locally. At present, our army is preventing the enemy's fierce counter-offensive in the South Pacific and is taking a defensive position. On the contrary, on the India-Burma border, we are exerting a strong offensive force and crushing the Central American forces in India. In China, we are also gradually breaking the enemy's conspiracy. From the above, it can be said that the current stage of the Greater East Asia War is to adopt a defensive posture in the east and an offensive posture in the west. However, the fate of the Greater East Asia War is actually still tied to the Pacific. If we can win in the Pacific, the Greater East Asia War will be completed. However, why is our army currently taking a defensive position in this area? This point has been mentioned several times, and it is actually affected by the insufficient air force, especially the number of aircraft is less than the enemy's. We have already paid attention to this and have now established a plan to greatly increase the production of aircraft. The whole country is united and working hard to promote it. In a few months, our air force will at least be able to compete with the enemy's forces in the Pacific and exert a sophisticated force to suddenly take an offensive posture. The enemy, the United States, has realized that we are so enriching our combat power and is trying to fight in this plan. Therefore, we have repeatedly failed in the Pacific and have not been able to approach our mainland even one step. From this, we can see that the current period is extremely important to complete the Greater East Asia War. If we take a wrong step, we can make the overall war situation collapse. On the contrary, if we can break through this barrier, victory will belong to us. Therefore, the increase in aircraft production is more important than anything else.</p>

<h3>Professor Omuko of the Japanese Imperial University Completes Super Hormone Agent: Can Play a Miraculous Effect on the Health of Soldiers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - "Aviation disease" and "diving disease" are the most feared diseases by aviation personnel and diving soldiers. In order to rescue patients from danger, the world's powers are keenly researching and competing to discover appropriate methods, but so far no conclusions have been reached, but only to supplement with high-quality food. Dr. Omuko Mikuniro, professor emeritus of the Japanese Osaka Imperial University, is a world-renowned hormone researcher. He has recently completed a super-powerful hormone agent, Terikimon, which is said to have a miraculous effect on the health of special combatants. All incurable diseases such as acute tuberculosis can be eradicated with this agent, and it has no harm to the human body. Taking ten grams a day is enough to support for a long time. All medical universities are actively researching it.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Indian Armies Await Opportunity to Attack: Decisive Battle at Dimapur, Enemy Counterattack North of Kohima Repelled</h3>
<p>Indian-Burmese Front, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On the Imphal front, the attacks of the Japanese and Indian armies against the British and Indian armies on the Dimapur Road are becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is continuing to transfer powerful mechanized units from the Dimapur area to the surrounding area of Prema for reinforcement, and is repeatedly bombing the Japanese and Indian armies by air. At the same time, elite troops are being used to reinforce a certain area and the north of Peikai Kuraima in order to prevent the advance of the Japanese and Indian armies. Therefore, fierce battles are currently taking place in all areas. Among them, the battle around the 461 Heights is the fiercest. On the 28th, the enemy launched a swift attack on the rear of the Japanese and Indian army positions under the cover of tanks and mortars, but failed. Several hundred enemy troops advancing from Zibuchai towards the north of Kohima were also repelled by the Japanese and Indian armies at dusk on the 28th. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been completely shattered. At the same time, the Japanese and Indian armies, which are firmly holding on to various strategic points, are now awaiting the opportunity to attack Dimapur, and it is expected that the decisive battle in that area will also begin soon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain place on the Indian front, on the evening of the 25th of last month, about 400 enemy troops secretly attempted to move near Melei Mai, 5 kilometers north of Kohima, intending to spy on the north of Kohima. The Japanese army immediately launched a surprise attack late that night and repelled the enemy troops. In addition, the remnants of the enemy around the 461 Heights, with the support of artillery units, are still holding on to their positions and attacking with Paibaos, but the Japanese army is not discouraged and is repelling the counterattacking enemy troops separately. In addition, the enemy has recently gathered more than 30 tanks of various types near Kilhmai (20 kilometers northwest of Kohima), intending to move south. The Japanese army has secured the strategy and has repelled the enemy troops each time.</p>
<p>Yangon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - On the 25th of last month, the ground troops shot down 14 enemy aircraft in one go during the air battle over the Manipur Valley under the cover of bomber squadrons. Among them were six DC3 aircraft. The battle achieved great results, and the Japanese warriors were all delighted. On the same day, the Japanese fighter squadron flying over the Arakan Mountains discovered four enemy DC3 aircraft attacking southwest from the Imphal area and immediately attacked the enemy aircraft. Initially, one enemy aircraft was shot down, and soon another aircraft crashed to the ground. Afterwards, the Japanese bomber squadron attacked the enemy fighter group, and the remaining two enemy aircraft took the opportunity to flee in embarrassment. The Japanese aircraft flew to the Lalabasa station as planned, accurately dropped bombs, and hit the central building of the military station. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to their defense area. On the way back, they encountered an enemy DC3 aircraft that had been shot down before and immediately hit its vitals with one shot, causing it to fall to the ground. At this time, the enemy's main aircraft squadron flew in from the southwest. The Japanese aircraft also shot at it. Just as they were thinking of returning to their original defense area, an aircraft suddenly flew in from the Imphal area. According to its flight posture, it seemed to be a connecting aircraft at the intersection of the enemy's air transport route. The Japanese aircraft immediately attacked from the side and fired several shots in a row. The enemy aircraft was hit and fell into the valley. In this battle, a total of 14 enemy aircraft were shot down, and all the Japanese aircraft returned safely to their defense area.</p>

<h3>Koiso Arrives in Tokyo and Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) According to a telephone call from Fukuoka, Koiso, the Governor-General of Japan and Korea, departed from Korea with his two secretaries, Kobayashi and Matsuoka, to report on political affairs to the Emperor. He arrived in Fukuoka on the afternoon of the 2nd and immediately boarded a plane to Tokyo. Upon arriving here, Koiso issued a statement regarding the recent situation in wartime Korea, the gist of which is as follows: Today, Korea is mobilizing its human and material resources to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. In terms of rice production, it is imperative to achieve a production target of 26 million koku (approximately 2.6 million cubic meters) (the usual amount is 23.35 million koku). It is also planned to supply 5 million to 6 million koku to the Japanese mainland. Other miscellaneous grains are also being actively promoted with a production target of 20 million koku. On the other hand, Korea's underground resources, such as coal, iron, and light metal minerals, are inexhaustible in practice. The current authorities are using abundant electricity to transform these resources into combat power.</p>
<h3>Thirty-One Cities Established Throughout Burma</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Burmese government has decided on concrete measures for the reconstruction of municipal administration in order to strengthen administration. In addition to Rangoon, a total of thirty-one cities have been established throughout the country, and municipal administration has been established.</p>
<h3>Bali District Chief Joins the Defense Army</h3>
<p>Jakarta (Central News Agency) The indigenous people of Java and other places are all cooperating with the Japanese army and actively engaged in construction. Recently, there has been a fine story of one who abandoned his hereditary high position to join the Volunteer Defense Army. It is said that Mr. Vout, the district chief of Bali Island in eastern Java, has always cooperated with the Japanese army and taken the lead in guiding local residents in various construction projects. When the Japanese army announced the formation of the Bali Volunteer Defense Army, he believed that the time to dedicate himself to destroying the British and Americans had arrived. He disregarded his hereditary position and advanced age and decided to enlist. He and his wife brought their baggage to meet with the Japanese military authorities, expressing their aspirations, which moved the readers and ultimately fulfilled his wishes. He also issued a statement as follows: The Japanese army is fighting for our Asia, and we are overjoyed to be able to cooperate with the Japanese army in destroying the British and Americans. Now, with the belief of sharing life and death, we will share the heavy responsibility of defending our homeland.</p>
<h3>Grew Appointed U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department announced on the 2nd that it has appointed former Ambassador to Japan, Grew, as Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs.</p>
<h3>Spain Concludes Agreement with Britain and the United States; Neutrality Unaffected; Spanish Sovereignty Remains Complete and Undiminished</h3>
<p>Madrid, 3rd (Central News Agency) Havas reports that the Spanish Foreign Ministry issued a communique yesterday stating that an agreement has been reached between Spain and Britain and the United States regarding the prohibition of oil shipments. The full text of the communique reads, "All outstanding issues regarding economic relations between Spain and Britain and the United States have been resolved through negotiations and an agreement has been signed. Due to the complexity of the issues, the negotiations have taken a long time. The agreement is based on an understanding of Spain's neutral status and the current reality. Relations between Spain and Britain and the United States have been tense in recent weeks, but now both sides have resumed normal relations. The elimination of the crisis does not harm the interests or prestige of the countries concerned."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) Britain and the United States had pressured Spain with the cessation of oil and other means, but Franco and Foreign Minister Jordana consistently negotiated with a firm attitude. Although crises were encountered repeatedly, the raw materials required by Spain, such as pyrite ore and iron, had to rely on Spanish imports. As a result, due to concessions from the United States and Britain, the negotiations gradually approached conclusion. A correspondent of the German News Agency stationed in Madrid reported that the Spanish government had always handled this negotiation carefully due to the various interests involved. As a result, Spain still insists on neutrality, and its sovereignty in trade and politics has not been impaired. The fact that the British and American governments stopped negotiating the import of oil is a diplomatic success. Although the British and American governments raised unreasonable demands regarding foreigners residing in Spanish territory, the Spanish government has always adhered to neutrality and treated representatives of the belligerent countries equally. The declaration in this communique of respecting neutrality and the interests of the countries concerned demonstrates the consistency of the above claims.</p>
<h3>Germany Attaches Great Importance to Turkey's Suspension of Chromium Ore Exports</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) When asked whether Ambassador Papen's return home could expedite the investigation into Turkey's suspension of chromium ore exports to Germany, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that there was still no definite date for the release of Germany's attitude. The German government is dealing with this issue from a completely independent standpoint and attaches great importance to this event.</p>
<h3>British Commonwealth Conference Reviews Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference resumed on the 2nd at the Prime Minister's residence in the city of Dartmouth, with the heads of the anti-Axis forces also in attendance. The two strategies for the European counter-offensive, political and military, were first reviewed. According to Reuters, the meeting is currently focusing on direct war matters, especially regarding the Pacific War. Australian Prime Minister Curtin and New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser both expressed their opinions.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Predicts the Imminent Arrival of a Great War</h3>
<p>Geneva, 3rd (Central News Agency) German News Agency dispatch from London: British Prime Minister Churchill said in a speech at the Dominion Conference on Monday that the Great War is about to reach "the most dangerous peak." At a time when the war is entering its most intense stage, he did not expect the conference to completely solve all the problems of the British Empire, but holding a roundtable meeting to exchange opinions is the right thing to do.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Powers Actively Sabotage Water and Land Transport Lines; Prelude to Landing Operations</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) The northwest coast of France, the Rhine River, the Danube River, and other transport routes are all strategically important lifelines. Therefore, British planes often bomb them with a large number of mines. This offensive echoes the destruction of transport lines behind the strongholds of Western Europe, indicating that an offensive operation is about to begin. Military experts are also very concerned about future developments. Since the beginning of March, the number of enemy mines cleared by the German patrol and minesweeping units in the English Channel to the Bay of Biscay has been three times that of the past. This fact proves that before the start of the war, the enemy had begun to hinder the movement of maritime transport convoys and seek to seize the initiative of the operational focus. The German minesweeping units safely detonated all these mines, and German breakthrough ships, exploration boats, destroyers, and others have foiled the enemy's attempt.</p>
<h3>Mine Design is Becoming Increasingly Sophisticated</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, British and German mine experts have been busy researching and manufacturing mines and their defensive weapons. Most of the mines currently used by Britain and the United States are magnetic mines, which are highly sensitive and different from the previous contact mines. Even if an iron wire passes through, its magnetic surface can explode immediately. At the beginning of the war, these magnetic mines were mostly fixed and placed on the seabed. Now they have been improved to be lightweight, that is, using the buoyancy of the mine, it can be tethered in the water. The sensitivity of magnetic mines is only about forty or so. After the appearance of this type of lightweight mine, the area for laying mines has been greatly expanded. The design of the mines is becoming more and more sophisticated, and the defensive weapons and removal methods are also changing with each passing day. During the preparation period for the invasion of Europe, the contact mines cleared by the German minesweeping units accounted for only 2% of the total number, and the rest were extremely dangerous magnetic lightweight mines. The method of laying these mines is entirely carried out by large aircraft at night. According to reports, the carrying capacity of enemy mine-laying aircraft is four to six mines, each weighing 600 to 1,000 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Residents Evacuated from the Belgian Coast</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) The German authorities have made full preparations to deal with the anti-Axis powers' launch of an invasion of Europe. According to the Belgian News Agency on the 2nd, the German occupation authorities have issued evacuation orders in general cities and towns in the coastal area of Belgium. Therefore, the residents of the two cities of Knokke and Kampenhout are moving to Flanders in the east.</p>
<h3>Mississippi River Floods; Disaster Area Covers 1.5 Million Acres</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to Havas, St. Louis: The Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Illinois River and the Missouri River, have flooded, and the American Red Cross estimates that no less than 1.5 million acres of land have been flooded. U.S. Army engineers said last night that a 30-mile-long section of levee 95 miles south of St. Louis is in danger of being breached. The flooded area is a vast expanse of muddy water, with only the roofs of houses visible.</p>
<h3>The U.S.-British Oil Scramble</h3>
<p>"America's oil will be exhausted in about twelve years." This is what U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Wartime Fuel Administrator Ickes said last year. At that time, there was much debate among experts about the correctness of this statement. Currently, the proportion of oil production in the United States accounts for a relatively high percentage of the world's total production. Compared with the surge in total production during the previous war, its rate of increase is very slow. Assuming that the current world's total production is 300 million tons per year, the United States produces about 60%. The United States, citing the sluggishness of oil production, believes that it is natural to lay claim to all oil-producing countries, and the most attention is paid to Britain. When Ickes issued the above warning, he said, "We should make extensive use of other countries' oil, and we must strive to conserve America's own oil." It can be seen what he meant. Moreover, this war is an excellent opportunity to drive Britain out of the important stage of oil production. Especially in West Asia, the two have been fighting secretly for a long time, and the result is gradually becoming unfavorable to Britain. In the Bahrain Islands (in the Persian Gulf), the United States has already obtained oil drilling rights for 29 companies, and in Arabia and Kuwait, 39 companies have obtained the same rights.</p>
<p>Britain's Oil Depot - Bahrain</p>
<p>Bahrain's oil production was 4,000 tons in 1935, and it surged to 1 million tons in 1940. Originally, Bahrain was particularly valued by the British Navy because of its oil and its strategic position. Oil is transported through submarine pipelines to Mena al-Ahmadi, an important base of the British Navy. Bahrain not only supplies oil to the British Navy in Aden, Bombay, and Ceylon, but also as far as Darwin and Sydney in Australia. Before the outbreak of the war, Britain ordered the American-owned Texaco to participate in Bahrain's oil, trying to deal with the situation temporarily, and was able to prevent American forces from entering that area. However, after Texaco's rights were bought by other large American companies, the United States sent troops to Bahrain, and Britain's loss of Bahrain was inevitable.</p>
<p>In 1933, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company obtained the rights to an oil field area of 400,000 square kilometers from King Ibn Saud in Saudi Arabia. Three years later, it began to extract large quantities of oil. Its production volume was only 2,000 tons in 1936, but it reached 800,000 tons in 1941. As a result, the oil reserves in the area have reached 40 million tons. Moreover, new oil fields are being discovered one after another, so Saudi Arabia will be the only oil-producing country in the world in the future.</p>
<p>Britain is Driven Out of Iran by the United States</p>
<p>The U.S. government recently established an oil storage company with Ickes as president. This move is of course an attempt to seize overseas oil resources, and the U.S. Navy is also strongly supporting this policy. Ickes said:</p>
<p>"The United States' participation in the development of overseas oil resources is to ensure the absolute requirements of the oil necessary for the United States and its allies in the future."</p>
<p>The main target of this demand is of course Britain. The former Thurman Committee of the Senate said that the United States demanded to develop the Iranian oil fields that had already produced 10 million tons of oil in 1934, and to participate in the development of the same American raw material resources, as the price for the materials supplied by the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>In 1941, Britain sent a strong force to Iran, but soon the Soviet Union also entered the country. It is said that there was some understanding regarding each other's spheres of influence, and now the United States has been added. The American financial advisor to the Iranian government, Sheridan, can in fact control the government. This proves that Britain has lost the important position it has maintained in the country for thirty years.</p>
<p>Britain has always obtained four-fifths of Iran's oil, which accounts for 27% of Britain's annual consumption of 30 million tons. From this, it can be seen how important Iran is to Britain. It is said that the United States has a budget of 150 million yuan to lay an oil pipeline from Saudi Arabia to the coast, and King Ibn Saud will have no way to deal with this American demand. Regarding the development of Turkey's oil resources, the United States recently asked Turkey to share the production volume equally, with the condition of laying a wheel pipeline from the oil field area to Melon, South Anatolia, but this was rejected by Turkey.</p>
<p>Africa is also Coveted</p>
<p>Africa currently cannot produce enough oil for its own needs. Egypt produced 631,000 tons in 1939 and now exceeds 1 million tons, making it the most important oil-producing country in that area. Britain's position in the country was once said to be stable, but American businessmen had already started and achieved considerable success. Moreover, the United States is not only coveting West Asia's oil, but the Canadian oil industry is also gradually investing in the two countries of the United States and Canada. Negotiations on the development of the oil fields between Fort Norman have been concluded. Trial drilling results show 137 tons per day. This oil will be supplied to the U.S. military stationed in Alaska through two oil pipelines in the future.</p>
<p>The United States also wants to control the oil in South America. The United States only has 2.5 million tons left, so it will naturally not let go of South America, which has an export capacity of 25 million tons. After occupying Trinidad in 1940, the United States established its foothold at the expense of Britain, and its position has been strengthened day by day since then. In this way, the United States is approaching Britain step by step and achieving the goal of grasping the world's oil production, which is now a very obvious fact.

<h3>China's Politics and Economy are Becoming Increasingly Clear and Progressive; Ambassador Tani Expresses his Impressions to Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. Ambassador Tani received Chinese and Japanese reporters separately at the Broadway Mansion on the afternoon of yesterday (3rd) at 5:30 pm. He spoke on the recent relations between China and Japan and Japan's cooperation with China, and answered in detail the questions raised by the Chinese reporters. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani at the reception (second person from the left)</p>
<p>Ambassador's Speech Ambassador Tani began by saying that he has been in office for more than a year since he took office in May of last year. During this period, he has strived to implement Japan's new policy towards China and to cooperate in strengthening the National Government. Until recently, he has felt even more pleased with this task. Since President Wang Jingwei's health was compromised, he went to Japan for treatment, and he is recovering well. The heads of the National Government are working harder, such as the acting president and the heads of various ministries, who have been working harder in politics and fulfilling their greatest responsibilities since the president left Nanjing, which is deeply admirable. I would like to briefly express my personal views on the National Government. First, from a political point of view, the National Government itself has recently shown a spirit of vigor. For example, personnel and systems have adopted a wartime system, and administration is also striving for simplicity and strengthening, which is being promoted step by step. Many of these have already been implemented, and I believe that everyone knows this well. Especially Shanghai, as the center of politics and economy for various countries, even with the recent changes in Shanghai, such as the changes in personnel in the municipal government, the adoption of a talent system, and the organization of public opinion organizations, at a time when the economic situation is difficult and the social situation is complex, the establishment of public opinion organizations can integrate the emotions and thoughts of officials and the people. Therefore, this move is quite important. In the future, the upper-level situation can be conveyed to the lower levels, and the lower-level situation can be relied upon to reach the upper levels. The establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee a few days ago, with 25 members, all of whom are recruited from the city's prestigious and important leaders from all walks of life, representing all the citizens, can also be said to represent all the Chinese people. It will not only provide advice on municipal administration but also make suggestions for the citizens. In the future, as the work of the committee gradually progresses, various problems can be solved concretely, and good results will definitely be achieved. I feel that Shanghai has recently shown a more clear phenomenon, and I am deeply pleased with this reform. Second, from an economic point of view, President Wang Jingwei of the National Government announced three major policies this year, the most important of which is to increase production. Currently, the National Government is very concerned about the policy of increasing production, such as concrete plans to increase the production of cotton and rice, and is determined to implement them. Furthermore, many factories in the Central China area, such as Shanghai, have been shut down and need to be utilized for manufacturing and production. Recently, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and various parties concerned have considered this plan and have concrete methods that will be implemented. Therefore, there will definitely be good results in increasing production in the future. Now that China and Japan are working side by side to complete the Greater East Asia War, they should always cooperate with each other. Japan will make its best efforts to cooperate with China in increasing production, developing factories, manufacturing industrial products, and so on. Therefore, the revival of Shanghai's industry is currently being enthusiastically researched. For example, the recent appointment of Ogura, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, who has many years of experience in the Japanese business community, came to Shanghai from Nanjing this time to exchange views with leaders from all walks of life in the city, which will be the beginning of cooperation in Shanghai's industry. The cooperation between China and Japan to seek the development of Shanghai's economy will gradually show signs, and I deeply believe that the Chinese people will also be very pleased with this.</p>
<p>Answering Questions Ambassador Tani then answered questions raised by the Chinese reporters: When will the abolition of extraterritoriality in China by the Allied nations be fully implemented? (Ambassador's answer) The abolition of extraterritoriality has been decided in principle, and Japan is researching it at all times, and has already begun the concrete abolition. For example, taxation rights are also one of the extraterritorial rights. However, regarding the complete abolition of extraterritoriality and when it can be completed, Japan and the National Government are currently cooperating and researching each other, preparing to implement it. When a complete solution can be announced, it is not yet the time to announce it. In short, Japan's cooperation with China will never cease. When will the factories managed by the Allied forces in China be fully returned to China for operation to increase production? (Answer) Currently, China and Japan are jointly fighting for the liberation of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the factories managed by the military will be determined based on future circumstances in terms of military relations. In recent years, the problems of commodity prices and people's livelihood in China have become increasingly serious. The control and rationing system itself has not been as sound as ideal. May I ask the ambassador, from the standpoint of the Allied nations, how will China be assisted in stabilizing people's livelihood in order to increase China's participation in the war? (Answer) I have explained this in detail in my thoughts. Japan is determined to cooperate with China with all its might, to seek to increase China's production, to suppress commodity prices, and to improve the economy. Then China's people's livelihood will be stable and the economy can be developed. Regarding the taxation issue of Japanese residents in China, what stage has it reached? (Answer) Regarding the taxation issue, Japanese residents pay taxes according to the tax items notified by the Chinese authorities to Japan. So far, the first notification has been completely completed, and the second notification has also been paid. We have not yet received the third notification from the National Government.</p>
<h3>Today is President Wang's Birthday; Flags are Hung Throughout the City to Pay Respects; The Municipal Government Holds a Celebration Ceremony</h3>

<p>The Industrial Survey Office of the First District Office has held several boiler stoker training classes in the past in order to protect public safety and improve industrial efficiency. In order to meet the needs of the fact, it plans to continue to hold the 13th Boiler Stoker Training Class. It is hoped that various factories will send stokers and factory managers to receive training, so that they can understand the structural principles of boilers, as well as methods for saving fuel and maintaining safety during use. The two boiler engineers, Hu Yunsheng and Jin Zhixuan, who have been certified by the District Office, will give lectures and project charts using slides. The managers and stokers who participate in the training must first submit a letter from the factory to the Industrial Survey Office, Industrial Technology Training Night School, Room 335, 3rd Floor, 113 Hankou Road to register, and pay a lecture fee of 20 yuan. Other tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived. Those who have been trained and have obtained a certificate do not need to register. The class is scheduled to start at 6:00 pm on May 8th. Registered students must report on time at the Municipal Model Middle School at 25 Xinhui Road (formerly Route Maréchal Joffre) and Jiangning Road (formerly Gordon Road). The training period is four weeks, once every Monday and Wednesday, from 6:50 pm to 8:30 pm.</p>
<h3>First Bureau Administrative Office Strictly Investigates Illegal Weighing Instruments</h3>
<p>The Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of the city, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from using illegal weights and measures, deducting quantities, and exploiting the public, has ordered the administrative sections of various sub-bureaus to send personnel to shops and firms in their respective jurisdictions at any time to inspect weights and measures. If there is a suspicion of a shortage of quantity, after verification that it does not meet the quantity, the shop owner will be handed over to the judicial authorities to be detained and sent to the court for legal action. It is also hoped that the public will cooperate and report unscrupulous merchants to the administrative sections of the various sub-bureaus for investigation.</p>
<h3>Dancing Girls and Singing Girls Must Register and Obtain Licenses</h3>
<p>The Vulgar Customs Division of the First Police Bureau's Administrative Office in this city notes that there are a large number of dancing girls, female receptionists, and singing girls in this city.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Expectations of Ambassador Tani</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, made a statement yesterday when he met with a group of reporters in Shanghai. He specifically expressed his expectations for the innovation of Shanghai, saying that the revival of Shanghai's industry is being studied. The other day, Mayor Chen said in his speech at the Municipal Advisory Council: "With economy, there is Shanghai; without economy, there is no Shanghai. If the economic problem cannot be solved, then the general problems of Shanghai cannot be solved."</p>
<p>We strongly agree with Mayor Chen's argument. At present, among Shanghai's economic problems, the shrinkage of industrial production and the operating rate of various factories are less than one-tenth of the normal level. In the midst of increasing production, which is the national policy, this is indeed a difficult problem to understand. If it is said that there is difficulty with power, then entertainment venues can still be brilliantly illuminated with electricity, while hospitals and factories face the same restrictions on electricity use. The distribution is extremely unreasonable. Secondly, passive restrictions are not the most appropriate method. It is necessary to actively transport fuel.</p>
<p>Some people advocate developing coal mines in Central China, which is certainly a fundamental solution, but it will not solve the immediate problem. The coal problem is not only related to industrial power but also to people's livelihood, which is equally important. We advocate hiring a large number of sailing ships to transport coal from Qingdao, Haizhou, and other places to Shanghai. We hope that the relevant authorities and entrepreneurs will work together to make this happen. Passenger trains can be reduced or suspended for a few days at a time, and trucks can be used exclusively to transport coal. Because most of the current passengers are not traveling for a specific purpose but are "running singles," which is not the normal clientele of the train.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani has high expectations for Shanghai's innovation. However, it is currently only the beginning of innovation, and comprehensive results require more effort.</p>

<h3>Shura (3)</h3>
<p>— by Iwata, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>That young man was Mutaguchi Takao. It was Takao who suddenly disappeared from Tozama Onsen.</p>
<p>On the road where he could only see the Milky Way in the darkness, he walked forward alone with his head down.</p>
<p>(It's painful to return to the apartment...)</p>
<p>In the three tatami-sized room, what awaited him were not just half-finished canvases and boards. Nor were they just dirty shirts and socks. The stench of turpentine, etc. As soon as he stepped into the doorway, countless poisonous snake-like anxieties and sorrows were waiting for him.</p>
<p>It was one kilometer from the station to the apartment. He deliberately chose a quiet road, taking several turns to make the distance as long as possible, and walked slowly.</p>
<p>(Ah! What am I going to do?)</p>
<p>This sentence had been on his lips for more than half a year. Whether it was day or night, there were many things in his mind that needed to be resolved. The fact that his face looked particularly old for his age was partly due to the hardships of life in Tokyo, but the influence of boredom and misery was a greater reason.</p>
<p>(I came to Tokyo with ambitions, but as a result, I have no way out).</p>
<p>Yes. When he was packing his bags for the journey to the capital at Kirishima Sulfur Valley Onsen, his whole heart and every cell in his body were burning with intense hope. He flew to Tokyo like a ball of fire in the sky.</p>
<p>That was the fire of Shura. It was the wild fire that burned in his heart due to the resentment of failing the physical examination at the old Naval Accounting School. It was the fierce fire of anger, resentment, and rebellion.</p>
<p>This ambitious young man from Satsuma's curse against the invisible fate was pitiful. He was angry and resentful towards the "Navy." The "Navy," which had completely overturned his deep desire to become a commander, accounting officer, and ship crew member, held an absolute resentment and anger.</p>
<p>(Okay, you hate me like this...)</p>
<p>He believed that the "Navy" hated him. He believed that he had severed ties with the "Navy," which he admired most in his life, forever. Therefore, to the same extent that he admired the "Navy," a fierce fire of anger broke out. He himself worked hard to take the path of hating the "Navy."</p>
<p>(I have already become the person most unconnected to the "Navy").</p>
<p>He made up his mind before going to Kirishima Onsen. At that time, he did not think of going to Tokyo, but of returning to his hometown.</p>
<p>(I don't want to see the faces of my military classmates. I don't want to see the faces of naval students of the detective type?)</p>
<h3>Huafeng Bank's Opening Ceremony Gifts Moved to Help Charity, Collected by this Newspaper on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>Huafeng Bank in this port is co-founded by well-known figures in the financial community and is scheduled to open on May 6. It is reported that the bank received a letter from the Thrift Association stating that the congratulatory gifts received at the opening ceremony are mostly flower baskets and scrolls, which are wasteful. It would be better to give cash and use it for the Shen and Xin newspapers' scholarship funds and other charitable causes, which is in line with the purpose of thrift and also beneficial to practical matters. The method is very good, and the bank expressed its deep sympathy and decided to comply. Those who wish to send opening ceremony gifts to the bank are requested to send them directly to the collection office of this newspaper for safekeeping in order to simplify the process. As the congratulatory gifts will be used to help charity, regardless of the amount or distance, the fee is fixed at ten yuan per rickshaw and will not be sent separately.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found</h3>
<p>Found Keys: Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, someone found keys on Jiangxi Road. The owner can describe the situation and claim them at this office.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Fountain Pen: I picked up a fountain pen on the tram from the Bund to Shanzhong Road on May 1 at around 5:00 PM and handed it over to ticket seller number 656 at number 127 (Ferguson Road). The owner can claim it from the tram company. Xianrong respectfully announces.</p>
<p>Seeking a Cure for "Heartache": My mother used to suffer from heartache, which would come and go. Recently, due to old age and weakness, it occurs several times a day. When it occurs, her heart feels like it is being cut with a knife, and she also vomits. Various treatments have been ineffective. I think there are many experts in the country, so I dare to ask for a good prescription. This disease is quite common in the countryside. If a good prescription can be obtained, it can also be widely distributed, which would be a great merit. Reader Lu Wenzhong respectfully submits.</p>
<p>Small Yarn Factory Service Society: The Small Yarn Factory Service Society is responsible for design for the development of small yarn factories. They can also introduce technical personnel and purchase machinery. Those interested can contact them at No. 141, Lane 1143, Dongyouheng Road.</p>
<h3>Lectures</h3>

<p>Moral Lecture: The 12th Grand Lecture will be held as usual from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on May 7 (Sunday).
