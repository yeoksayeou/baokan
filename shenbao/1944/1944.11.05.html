<h3>雷伊泰空激戰　日軍迭予敵重創　大本營昨日發表所獲戰果</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日下午三時發表：（一）雷伊泰島之日軍陸地部隊，目下正於塔拉克及塔克羅班西方高地附近與敵激戰中，自敵軍登陸以來至十月三十日止，日軍陸上部隊所獲戰果已經判明者如次：殺傷敵兵四千五百餘名，破毀敵戰車十二輛，陸地砲隊給予敵艦船之損失，計擊毀巡洋艦一艘，擊沉擊毀驅逐艦各一艘，擊沉擊毀登陸用舟艇一百十五艘，因挺進攻擊敵機起火或被毀者二十架。（二）日軍航空部隊，速日攻擊雷伊泰鳥附近一帶之敵，予以重創，尤以自十一月二日夜至三日拂曉，反覆猛攻塔克羅班及聖巴布羅機場及塔拉克海面敵艦船，收獲之戰果如次：敵機起火及被毀者一百十架以上，機場設施起火者的二十處，運輸船起火者一艘，日機損失五架。</p>
<p>馬尼刺四日中央社電　敵美增强之塔克羅班機場，自二日夜至三日拂曉，經日軍予以澈底攻擊後，三日其對菲律賓來襲乃見微弱，計呂宋地方三十二架，比塞亞地方二十一架（以大型機爲主），民答那峨地方十一架，合計六十四架多爲偵查察性質。</p>
<p>日空軍不分畫夜猛炸敵方各機塲</p>
<p>馬尼刺四日中央社電日軍航空部隊，二日正午至下午八時，於雷伊泰島西方上空，曾與敵Ｂ24型機四十架，P38型機的五十架，展開激烈空戰，結果擊落其B24型機一架P38型機五架，又擊毀其B24型P38型十一架。雷伊泰島東方，二日亦曾展開壯烈空戰，日方擊落美機九架外，並擊落P38型機一架，米證實者有擊毀B24型機一架。</p>
<p>馬尼刺四日中央社電　據日機二日晨偵察，塔克羅班機塲停有敵大型機的百三十架，中型機的七十架，日陸空軍爲予澈底擊滅計，二日夜至三日晨七時，連襲該機塲，滑翔路上排列之敵機二百以上，瞬間中彈起火者的半數，同時數處發生大火，日機完成任務後次第安返。</p>
<p>馬尼刺四日中央社電　日陸單航空部隊，二日夜猛炸雷伊泰鳥之美空軍基地，塔拉克機塲二處，夫羅亨機塲一處，各中彈燃燒。又傅該夜美機塲上空有夜間哨戒機哨戒，同時塔拉克附近之防空砲火，亦頗　烈，故該地美空軍似已相當有力。</p>
<h3>「天兵」「梅蕟」機對　繼之發揮肉彈精神</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日神風特別攻擊機隊敷島機隊建立殊勳後，純忠隊突擊隊，相繼出動，捲起擊滅敵軍必死必中之肉彈，神風震撼敵軍心胆。頃更有新銳之「天兵隊」，「梅花隊」等，於雷伊泰灣方面收獲壯絕之戰果，業經日大本營於三日發表。綠本月一日上午九時半許，神風特別攻擊隊，天兵隊，接悉於斯黎高東方發現敵機動部隊之情報後，即由基地出發，猛烈突破敵直接衛護機之反攻，衝入敵機動部隊，咸認定一巡洋艦爲目標，即由一機猛然降下，直衝敵艦，當即使其起火爆炸，但是否沉沒，則未判明。另一架撞中敵巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，使其即時爆炸，黑烟冲天。又日軍直接掩護機一架亦起而呼應，投下炸彈，命中敵巡洋艦一艘，以上三敵艦是否沉沒，雖由於敵直接護衛機反攻熾烈未得判明，料想嗣後當均沉沒。又是日同時，神風特別攻擊隊之另一隊，對由雷伊泰灣南下之戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦數艘之敵艦羣，敢行突擊，一架撞中敵巡洋艦一艘，將其擊沉，一架突入敵巡洋艦一艘，其戰果未明，同時神風特別攻擊機隊，梅花隊，亦於是日下午六時過後，攻擊向雷伊泰灣南端之帕拉翁海峽南下之一艘敵戰艦，一架命中其前桅根部，即刻見其發生大火，黑烟冲天，停止航行，向右傾斜，但以霧氛太重，未能確認其是否沉沒，一方面，日軍航空部隊一日上午八時半，於雷伊泰灣內之霍蒙本島西方海面，發現擁有巡洋艦，驅逐艦、之敵艦一隊，當即加以猛攻，以雷擊轟沉其巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，並使另一艘驅逐艦爆炸沉沒。又二日上午六時許，更於斯黎高海峽，轟炸敵輸送船一艘，將其擊沉。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日一舉神風特別攻擊機隊，自十月二十五日以來不斷出動，截至現在，正式發表之肉搏拼撞戰果如决：轟沉空母三艘，輸送船一艘，巡洋艦二艘，擊毀空母六艘，戰艦三艘，輸送船一艘，巡洋艦三艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，艦種不詳者三艘，累計轟沉擊沉擊毀共二十四艘。</p>
<h3>麥克沃塞　險遭不測</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　美空軍遭日空軍之猛襲，其制空權已形喪失。機塔克羅班消息，傳日空軍某日空襲塔克羅班，以機槍掃射之際，一彈穿入菲律賓登陸作戰司令官麥克沃塞之辦公室，窗內彈路距麥克沃塞之頭部僅十二英寸，麥克沃塞可謂九死一生。</p>
<h3>敵機襲北千島　擊落一架</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　據日軍東北方面某基地電，敵B25型機五架，曾於一日白畫侵入北千島占守島之幌延，當被日軍擊落一架。</p>
<h3>日軍精銳部隊　佔領恭城陽朔　桂林市三面遭受猛擊</h3>
<p>近兩個月來，記者得有機會，在京滬京燕兩綫及江浦等地巡禮一次，一切情形已詳於歷次通訊。際此大東亞戰爭，已臨決戰時期，最近盟軍在台灣及菲律賓海面又獲大捷，予敵美以重創，勝利基礎，益形奠定。凡我東亞民族，靡不歡欣鼓舞，等待最後勝利之來臨。中華民族爲大東亞重要之一環，在此最後關頭，尤應加緊協力戰爭，努力邁進。但在中國現階段之下，祗有增加生產，貢獻物資的一途。記老此次沿途所見所聞，覺各方對於增加生產一事，尚有許多矛盾現象。雖然物資貢獻並未停頓，但似已近於竭澤而魚，終非久計。委就實際觀感所及，貢獻管見如次：</p>
<p>（一）倡導增產務須澈底　當局年來注重增產，設立機構，攬延人材，推進工作，不遺餘力。今日開會，明日講演，城市人心雖覺興奮。但深入農村觀察，尚未完全做到，不無舍本趨末之譏，以長成效何在，實成問題。譬如如與首都近在咫尺之江浦某鄕，記者曾經多次詢問農民，政府年來重視農業增產並設立機構，策進其事，有所感動吾？却完全茫然不知。嗣往各有關機關，如鄕保鎭等公所，層層詢問，幾均不感興趣，有稱在報上看見過的，有稱曾經接到一二件關於增產的公文，總而言之，並未發生作用。此種情形，亟宜調整，對於農村推進增產工作，應力謀切合實際，不然，此種工作徒在都市吶喊，而不能深人農村，殊難收增逾實效。</p>
<p>（二）確保治安與革除苛雜　後方民衆擔當增產重任，至少必須得到最低生活的安定，方能從事生產。記者所經各鄕村，治安良好者實屬不多，至於苛捐雜稅，層層勒索，幾已成爲各地通病。農民大都呻吟於負擔重重的困苦之中。甚至首都郊外，即有不法之徒，强收柴草。農民已至救死不遑，安能增產。</p>
<p>（三）實物徵收應簡明化　政府爲適應戰時體制，田賦實行實物徵收，記者巡禮各農村時，農民每談及此事，大多平添憂　。蓋以此事係屬初創，並無成規可循。尤其一般之不肖鄕長鎭長區長等，平日早已花樣百出，魚肉鄕民，現有這樣更張機會，自然要大加利用，暗圖肥已。此事關係至鉅，深望當局對於繳納數量，繳納手績，以及運輸存儲等事項，有一　單明瞭的辦法公佈。使農民有所適從，藉以防止一切可能之弊端。</p>
<p>至於電力限制，應加以合理調整，以期增加生產工廠之動力。交通機關應加以澈底改善，以謀圓滑運輸，疏通物資，各地莫不極端期待。</p>
<h3>日軍精銳部隊　佔領恭城陽朔　桂林市三面遭受猛擊</h3>
<p>廣州四日中央社電　據廣西日軍前綫電，日軍精銳部隊，呼應攻擊挂林作戰，排除渝第二十軍重砲火之頑强抵抗，於二日上午，攻佔恭城（桂林東南方六十五公里）。又另一日軍有力部隊，於三日上午十時，佔領桂林平樂間要衝陽朔（桂林南方六十公里），而切斷喻軍退路。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據路透社重慶訪員報吿桂林戰况如次：日軍刻自南北東三方面進擊桂林、渝軍正據守市外三公里某高地之陣地，強行抵抗。桂林週圍多高達二三百英尺之邱陵，而邱陵一帶復多巨穴，實爲　然要塞。桂林南方之日軍，爲謀完全包四桂林，克正向西方移動，桂林東南方之日軍，則正繼續南進，與沿西江西進之部隊，取得聯絡。據渝方當局宣稱，渝軍有力部隊，正在廣西省東北省境之東安附近，試行切斷日軍鐵路及公路等交通路綫，此舉是否能緩和日軍對桂林之强壓，須視今後之發展如何。又據美軍方面訊稱，日軍一部隊，已到達桂林東方八公里之美軍空軍基地云。</p>
<p>廣西前綫四日中央社電　呼應桂林攻略突破都龐嶺峻險，攻取富川，更向西進之日軍先鋒，自一日晚於桂林南方要衝，攻擊渝卅七軍之據點平樂，排除渝軍頑强抵抗，績行夜襲，遂於該日夜十一時，將之佔領。</p>
<p>進迫永福佔寺石圩　衡陽四日中央社電據廣西前綫日軍電，日軍快速部隊，於傍晚在桂林南方三五公里永福附近，圍攻自桂林逃出之渝新編第八師及新福十九師。於三日晨開始總攻擊，一部日軍强渡桂江，進迫永福，其陷落已在目前。</p>
<p>美將校出現桂前綫　湖南前綫四日中央社電　廣西省西江日軍，已於上月二十八日佔據上流要衝江口墟，按該戰役之第一綫，有美人將校一參加，日軍佔領之渝軍陣地，鹵獲有美國製衣服器具等甚多。前湖南前綫，曾傅美人將校督戰，茲復出現於廣西前綫矣。</p>
<h3>三品部長　談論戰局</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍三品報道部長，四日發表談話如次</p>
<p>桂林在日軍精銳部隊之重圍下，已極形恐慌，日軍在中國之攻勢，與敵方之所謂「日軍之攻勢已達其最高限度，再無餘力進攻桂林」云云，完全相反。自日軍佔領衡陽後，英美及渝方已深知日軍攻勢之富於機勢性。前於六月間長沙陷落時，余曾聲明，對於英美及重慶之妄想，及希望式的觀測，日本之戰力已消耗在太平洋，或西南亞方面，無進攻之餘力等，此次作戰，將以嚴正之事實及警吿，予以答覆。</p>
<p>又關於佔領地之復興建設方面，目前洛陽·鄭州。等平漢綫沿綫已不待言，即湖南方面，亦在順利進展中。一切復興工作，皆收獲預期以上之成續。令當地民衆之安居樂業，已足爲其充分證明。其中最引人注目者，爲衡陽作戰渝勇將方先覺將軍，現已率其部下組成先機軍，充滿自主建國之決心，担任鄕土湖南之自衛興建設。方將軍在此烟硝未熄之湖南戰野，能自主停戰，担負起復興工作，誠令人感奮。</p>
<p>目前英美侵略東亞之遠征軍及空軍，已在太平洋印度洋及中國大陸，被日軍覆滅，尤其西南航空要塞，爲敵軍稱之中國大陸不沉空母桂林今亦即將陷落，試觀斯蒂威爾　强奪在中國之統一指揮，捷諾特不分敵我之焦土轟炸，羅斯福之毒辣謀略的出於其欲支配中國之野心，及帝國主義之毒計，欲使中國變爲奴隸市場。是以中國是否非借此等惡魔之力。即不能維持社稷，諒全中國聰明之民衆及指導者，必能捫心自問也。</p>
<h3>從英美壓迫下　自求解放途徑　岸情報部長特別演講</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　日駐華大使館情報部長岸偉一氏，於四日晚九時半，發表中日同盟條約，及大東亞共同宣言週年紀念特別廣播，茲誌要旨如次：</p>
<p>中國人民對於大東亞戰爭一年，重慶延安方面固不置論外，即和平區民衆亦似極冷淡。對於中日同盟倏約，及大東亞共同宣言，亦似未有如期待中之感銘。回憶上次世界大戰時。英美雖曾以具有宣傳價値之</p>
<p>民族自決　海洋自由等爲戰爭目的，但在此次大嚴中，對其本國國民，則已明確表示戰爭目的之自信亦已喪失。此觀邱吉爾之僅高呌「爲勝利而戰爭」等，即可爲最好證明。此種毫無目的，僅爲確保自已不合理之存在而戰的戰爭，中國民衆縱以英美之勝利爲前提，對英美戰局之有利，亦幷無任何興奮之表示。中國民衆對於和平，對於戰勝，均</p>
<p>不感興趣　想其原因，第一爲不相信英美勝利，能如上次世界大戰後有經濟的政治的好轉。第二因只把戰爭從物量方面看，因有只認以生產力之數字，可定勝敗之英美同樣的唯物思想。故對日本之勝利，幷未深抱期待，以致喪失全面和平之熟意。此種心理，結果乃成爲中國人缺乏亞細亞意識的原因。在過去英美的</p>
<p>世界體制　中，因爲對於亞洲，尤其日本進步，所不斷發生的變革，不能理解。因此依然仍未有以亞洲之主體性的意識，因此，乃以此爲一種宿命的事實，而關閉一切「沒法」之中，只想於舊證制中，求如何苟安，以圖保全自己。蔣介石氏之一中國心思想，亦即爲此。</p>
<p>如以日同盟倏約，與英美對瑜方之發除不平等條約，加以比較，而欲以此相提並論，此實爲英美式的思想。蓋中日同盟條約之條文，雖至簡單，但其中料含有</p>
<p>復興亞洲　之偉大希的　與堅强之決意。是故，因大東亞戰爭而發現日本一大心理的革命形態之一例，即爲中日同盟條約。亞洲不能復興，日本即無發展，而亞洲復興，成爲中國實現自主獨主不可缺的條件。凡此判斷與決意，均無不躍動於此條約中，如不貝及此重要之事實，忘部此種信念，唯從交還一租界與撤廢不平等條約，即採具體的措置，作事務的觀察，如僅着重於物的三方面，則</p>
<p>中日同盟　條約，及顯示於渝方之英美的撤廢不平等條約，在本質上，就成爲無何不同之處。此蓋渝方之中國人士，素已喪失視之無形聽之無聲的淸醉的「東洋之人生觀。」余說明日，大西洋憲章僅爲英美指出之戰爭目標，亦可謂爲彼等國家意志之表示。有調大西洋憲章爲具體的，大東亞宣言爲抽象的，甚至結論頃向於具體的將佔優勢，但實際上欲維持現狀之英美，則無具體一表現，亦未有具體之聲明，然志在</p>
<p>改革現狀　，實現大東亞建設之理想者，並表現此舉之決意。兩者相較，遂有顯關差別，大東亞宣言之內容，雖然抽象，但其內部，濟有一種大理想，及新東亞先覺者之熟情。若對此加以漠視，則有將大東亞宣言，與大西洋憲章誤作爲一體看待之見解。又英美之種種行爲，實具有感覺性的，反之，東亞的</p>
<p>一切舉措　內含有歷史與民族性的。即以建國未滿三百年之美國而論，實極一難具備此條件，而參加大東亞宣言諸國，皆具有數千年悠久之歷史，在此點上，雙方即有不同的分與點。</p>
<p>一般所謂知織份子因受英美思想長期間之渲染，故受英美之毒甚深，目前務應明確區別此種西方勢利思想，與東方道義精神之不同，立於東亞之立場，若未能轉換此觀念，則對</p>
<p>建設東亞　前途，影響甚大。故渝方現今之不能確立自己之主體性，以致亞洲之獨立自主亦不能立即實現，即爲有力之明證。由是以觀，目前日本業已担當起肅清英美思想，解放東亞戰爭之先進，並進而協力東亞各民族獨立自主。所以日本竭誠希望，凡東亞各民族具有眞誠担任解放東亞之責者，亦即爲日本有力之友人。俾能在同一戰綫上緊密協力，向共同</p>
<p>人挺進　總之，大東亞戰爭之本質，由日本立場觀之，爲欲脫離英美帝國主義之侵略。由中國及其他大東亞各國立場觀之，則爲由被壓迫之地位，自求解放。能獲致此適應潮流政策之國家，必能獲得最後勝利。在過去三年間，日本及與同盟之東亞諸國，基此共同崇高之目標，互相提携，致力於完遂大東亞戰爭，以期達到東亞之解放，完成共存共榮之大東亞建設，使之恢復爲東亞人之本來面目，故今後唯有本中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言之本旨，以向建設大東亞之前程猛進</p>

<h3>零售商店不遵限價實施檢舉取締　經濟保安處當局發表談話</h3>
<p>關於實施取締零售商物價，經濟保安處當局，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>物價問題，對安定民生關係至大，是爲市民所悉知，無庸贅述。現在市內各小零售商店，其販賣價格，區區不齊，內中尤有以非法高價貪圖暴利者，不可勝數，且隨時任意提高價格，甚至有朝價夕改之勢。此種情形，由於一般民衆對商品之認識缺乏，與多數奸商巧圖漁利所致，而一般正當商人，亦隨波逐浪，相競提高價格，市民亦以此爲必然之趨向，其結果統制機關之努力，抑制施策，徒費心機，物價在騰，民生愈趨危殆，實令人寒心咋舌。本處基於物穀對策之本義，決對惡質奸商嚴行取締。自數日前，先就與市民有深切關係之食用品店舖，開始調查，於十月二十七日對非法奸商，加以檢舉，就中允對惡質者，決處以嚴懲不貸，現仍縱續調查中。</p>
<p>市內各商店之零售價格，各由該同業公會審定，呈經行政機關核准通吿在案，極應嚴格遵守勿違，而一般市民如認有不正常個格時，宜對照該店內之限價一覽表，購買之。此次取締物便，首由食用品漸决移至主要商品，對違反者毫不寬容，加以處罰，仰各商人務遵守限便，市民亦勿私囤巧買爲要。違反食用品店舖，其主要者如下：肉舖，雜糧舖及其他一般食品舖。</p>
<p>不遵限價店名，及所在路名，十月二十七日，（×兩項越價）同生祥東長治路，昇利天潼路，和森愼方浜路，×仁大方浜路，公盛天潼路，協昌崇德路，純記柬槐海路，正豐肇嘉路，鴻泰肇嘉路，治昌肇嘉路，萬興肇周路，得勝祥肇周路，×仁大方浜路，仁義江蘇路，大豐昌記醴陵路，愼康裕天潼路，元和北河南路，兆豐新西倉路，勤成西倉路，年和肇周路，萬源福建路，泰昌肇周路，萬森福肇周路，實大新肇周路，萬康祁門路，長茂西康路，美鑫西康路，愼成新西康路，萬通順西康路，元記柬長治路，同慶永天潼路，，同順新北河南路，張領新北河南路，萬茂成永譸街，萬潤寗夏路，環球廣東路，協豐廣東路，廣泰祁門路。茂隆祁門路，公成靜安寺路，大陸靜安寺路，亞西亞靜安寺路，蔡洪興楊樹浦路，趙海榮梧州路。</p>

<h3>松平部長廣播「勝利之路」　實現共同宣言理想</h3>
<p>盟邦大使館上海事務所報道部長松平忠久氏，於四月午後七時二十分，在上海電臺廣播，題爲「勝利之路」。原詞如下：</p>
<p>反羅斯福勢力抬頭　（一）去年十一月五日，舉行大東亞會議之際，余正於東京，恰巧會讓中連續發表布根維爾海面之大戰果，余憶及參加會議之各國代表及隨員，均極表興奮。今屆此歷史的宣言之一周紀念日，太平洋上又獲空前之大戰果，日本國民而至大東亞諸國之國民，無不共表興奮，而相反則敵美因受此影饗，極表恐慌。而允常此選舉大總統之際，以羅斯福爲領袖之現政權及民主黨方面，極感狼狽，乃極力誇大宣傳雷伊泰灣之登陸戰，而一方面則竭力隱瞞其海戰所受之損失，甚至僅發表其所受之損害，祗有六隻。惟此次作戰，對於美國大總統之選舉戰，大有影響，在第三次當選之時，羅斯福以苦鬥而得連任，而此次第四次之競選，頗爲困難，實因其國內之二大反羅斯福勢力之抬頭也。此二大勢力，其一乃陣亡將士之遺族，其二乃大資本及企業家。</p>
<p>政戰目的完全一致　（二）凡軍事外交及國內政治之成爲一體化，不論戰事及平時，均能使國力大爲發展。自中日事變以來，政略及戰略之方針，已屢决決定，國內政治與軍事合而爲一，且日本國民均有愛國之心，而以皇室爲中心，一致團結，故政戰合一，極爲容易也。而日本之對中華民國之方針，已於去年十月三十一日之中日同盟條約，對中外闡明，即親善友好及尊重自主獨立，並基於道義之精神，緊密協力大東亞建設，貢獻於全世界之和平，凡障害中日方好之禍根，當努力去除，日本負起此項義務，而同時中國亦負起此項義務，凡妨害達成此項目的之勢力，不論英美及重慶，均決意掃蕩，此乃中日同盟條約之精神，亦即大東亞宣言之精神。</p>
<p>結集力量　完遂戰爭　（三）我等之目的旣在戰勝英美，而達到中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言之理想，而爲東亞民族發服之憲章。我等之信念，即爲自覺之信念，其理想即爲祖國之防衛及大東亞建設之兩目的也。而我等集中最大之力量，而行施於對於戰爭勝利最有效果之場所，即爲走向勝利之路。此戰爭非但爲日本人之戰爭，對於大東亞各國爲求達成共同之目的起見，均有努力之義務。我等當結集此等戰友之共同綜合力量，或直接參加戰爭，或間接努力從事於對於戰爭必要物資之獲得增產，供給勞力，改良技術，及增强交通力，以協助大東亞戰爭，則必能達成中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言之共同理想，而完成大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>盟邦民意昂揚　一致奮起努力不倉顧問發表談話</h3>
<p>國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，於本年七月初旬因事返國，即在國內養疴，始於本月一日來華，三日抵滬，昨（四）日下午三時半，特在正金大樓會見本市中國新聞記者。小倉最高顧問准時偕同國府全國經濟委員會主任顧問新木榮吉氏接見，即席由小倉顧問闡揚日國民精神之昻揚振作，一致在戰時努力本位，及重視中國經濟狀况。其談話如次；</p>
<p>戰時日本民意昂揚　「本人比次歸國爲期四月左右，始於最近返華，在國養疴，對於日本國民振作精神，尤深感意義重大，更自塞班島一役，日軍之壯烈戰死精神，尤引起國內民意昻場，嶄然一新。雖此次日本內閣之更動，由小磯大臣出任首相，官民益爲打成一片，故塞班島之日軍精神，在民間顯着有更大之效果。查大東亞神聖戰爭揭開序幕之初，日本全國朝野一致奮起，向撲滅英美勢力之途邁進，乃至塞班鳥一役後，情陼更爲振舊，對現時代情勢，至爲明暸，在政府領導之下，每一國民莫不努力本位工作，堅定信念，爲國家爲祖先努力。例如軍屬之生產，已頗爲可觀，如航空機船舶之增產，已比去年增强一倍，日本建國以來，曾遭遇艱難多决，而全國上下，尤其國民憑着堅强信念，努力發揮，克服困苦，獲取最大勝利，此項精神，至今又重現於全國。憶念日本松山元帥對國內靑年海軍將士之貢獻，不勝贊佩，本人對此亦且同感，尤其國內之靑年男女學生，科學家，技術家，不分畫夜爲本位工作努力不懈。再如上次敵美機隃襲日本土八幡及滿洲國鞍山，結果一無所逞，於茲足見是本國內在防空對策上，已有萬會準備，無庸顧慮。此外三年日國內大米產量，與平時無異，毫無疑問，在消耗物價統計上，情形至爲良好，故太人此次返國旅行，最感欣快」。</p>
<p>集結資源安定民生　關於中國經濟問題，小倉氏語謂二「日本對中國經濟問題，決根據對華新政策進一具體與積極的努力，以完一遂大東亞戰爭勝利，及建設東亞的目的，故使中國資源戰力化，尤其對中國民生安定爲主要重點。所以中國資源買獻大東亞戰的成績，就任，即使將對華新政策旨趣視爲大東亞戰必要之舉。日本在大東亞戰場不是對付中國的重慶，而是打倒敵英美的侵略政策，將來中國經濟的復與，仍由中國人去做，但中國資源戰力化，及建設新中國丙事。仍以安定民生爲前提，中日經濟界的意志均趨一致，過王去各持異端的見解，已經消滅。最後小倉氏對於中國物資績制圓滑及抑平物價問題，表示研究合理的改善。」</p>
<h3>取締危險物　明日登記</h3>
<p>本市警察局爲取締燃火性及爆發性之危險物，定於明（六）日起開始實施辦理登記手績，於是日上午九時起至十一日下午四時，向就近經濟保安處所屬之經濟警察隊領取申請書，地點計（一）中央區福州路警察總局內經濟警察隊第一隊，（二）前舊八區泰山路警察分局內經濟警察隊第二隊，（三）南市區蓬萊路警察分局內經濟警察隊第三隊，（四）滬西地區華山路警察分局內經濟警察隊第四隊，（五）蘇州河以北地區虹口警察分局經濟警察隊第五隊。此次之取締危險品登記與一般商品登記不同，如有抗命未登記者，予以嚴重懲處。</p>

<h3>南通丸　沉沒經過</h3>
<p>航政局發表　關於中華輪船公司南通丸，於十月廿三日晨五時在許浦失事，茲悉建設部上海航政局，曾先後派員調查肇事經過，該局負責入發表派員調查經過情形如次：</p>
<p>本局於接得南通丸失事報吿後，當即派員赴中華公司分別向該公司負責人，生還船員，及被救乘客調查肇事原因經過。據該輪生還船員聲稱，自口岸開出時，下艙裝戰小麥三百包，活猪二百餘隻，蛋五百蔀，一部分蛋蔀分裝於二層艙內，三層艙裝載鷄鴨節，及旅客並隨帶貸特之單帮乘客。行至天星橋，二層艙又裝燒酒六十六　，至十月廿三日晨五時餘於睡夢中，爲船身傾斜所驚覺，發現下艙進水，船員恐慌，乘客秩序亦隨之大亂，船身愈形傾斜不定，下艙猪仔因之騷動不已，船身愈難穩定，未幾即告沉沒，據該公司負責人稱，該公司派赴出一事地點調查之社員潛水夫，尚未返社報吿，詳情仍未判明，再所派赴當地之新平。靑山二輪，業經返滬，因該地水深無法打撈。已更派新源論前住調查，至於善後問題，該公司已組有遭難處理委員會辦理之。此次該輪由口岸開出時，究竟裝載客貨確數須待當地代理店正式報告後，再行宣佈。該南通輪噸位爲二一七噸，乘客限額爲六七零人，因此輪係由海軍當局撥交該公司行駛，故不呈經航政局檢查丈最辦理登記各項手續。</p>
<p>又據調查生還這旅客等專用稱，該輪此次乘客船員等，幾達二千人左右，是客貨裝載量，超出法定額過鉅，致雖奇禍，至不可收拾。</p>
<p>就以上調查所得情形研究，雖肇事詳情尚未全部判明，然該公司負責人旣稱該輪乘客法定限額爲六七零人，船身噸位二一七噸，則載重逾量，已爲致禍這主因，可以想見。際此戰時體制，一部分航運，置於軍管理之下，該南通丸係由友邦海軍當局撥交中華公司行駛，一切丈檢登記事宜，在特殊淸形之下，並不經由本局辦理，惟此項國籍不能確定之船隻，爲數當不在少，深盼友邦有關當局，曁受委託託之輪船公司，今後對於船舶丈檢工作，船負考核管理等項，密切注意，並應與航政局取得連繫，庶不至再發生類此情事。</p>

<h3>北緬前綫　敵空挺部隊擊滅記</h3>
<p>本年三月間降落於北緬戰綫的敵空挺部隊在摩爾建立堅固陳地，此次此緬空挺部隊殲減戰，就以該陳地的攻略戰最爲激烈。此次戰鬥中，在空陸一體的科學戰中發揮了多少力量，邊擊的日軍怎樣潰減敵軍？</p>
<p>少尉始終參與從印度到密芝那的空挺討伐戰，以下是少尉所寫的手記。</p>
<p>蜂巢式的堅壘</p>
<p>四月六日，與蜂巢式的堅壘對陳，相隔僅六十二米。</p>
<p>這一帶是伊拉瓦底河的支流，都是已開關的水田，鐵道南北縱貫此平原。沿鐵道兩側爲高約百米的丘陵，摩爾陳地爲位於其南的五個山丘，面積約六百米平方。陳地雖不廣大，但丘陵起伏，形成天惠的要塞。</p>
<p>先是，三月五日，溫藍特（已陳亡）少將的空挺隊一旅團在加薩東南三十公里尼榮貝貢部落附近降落北上，其主力潛入此山，構築陳地，三月十日左右到達，第二日完成射擊陳地，第三日，開掘聯絡壕，不數日陳地構築完成。</p>
<p>陳地資材使用採伐的硬木材，從附近搜集的鐵軌，空輸的土塞等。從山頂的山腹，完全是掩蓋壕，追擊砲陳地，散兵壕，機關槍掩讀體，密如蜂窠。山腰間更繞鐵刺網，遍地地雷密佈，故稱該陳地爲蜂巢陳地。</p>
<p>突破陳地一角</p>
<p>第一次攻擊是三月二十日，四月六日，增援部隊準備就緒，從敵陳東方開始攻勢。攻擊均爲衝鋒隊的夜襲戰，當某一人接近敵的鐵刺網時，迫擊砲，機槍就從山頂噴火，佈成火網的絨毯。我軍本着戰必勝，攻必克的戰陳訓，前仆後繼，一口氣突破高地陳地的一角。不過制空權在敵人手裏，天色一明，敵的轟炸機羣就來光顯，轉瞬間附近炸彈如雨而下。幾小時後，布製的對空布板在兩陳之間距離不到二百米的地方劃成一條白綫，藉資區地敵我的陳地。</p>
<p>補給完全依賴空輸。將士亦用運輸機輸送。點着尾燈的運輸機羣，每夜在敵上空旋轉。途中有三處敵陳地放起信號火箭，飛機在三角形的中心，用無數降落傘投下物件。點着紅的翼燈的是食糧搭載機，青的是武器彈藥，黃的是衛生材料，每機擲落三百人一天中所需的東西。</p>
<p>主力向後轉進</p>
<p>十四日晨，所調部隊企圖包圍敵陳地，從背後向北方高地迂囬。從那裏一眼可見離敵陣地西方不到五十米的地點，有五百米左右的機場滑走路。我們從摩爾南方部落實海因北進，不到十公里，這飛機場已經是第四個了，名爲飛機場，實際上僅是一條速戰成的滑走路。機場的一角，佈置着空　的高射機關砲。</p>
<p>空挺部隊在機場築成以後，即在其傍構築陣地，在周圍派遣陣地外部隊，以備偷襲，陣地，機場，運輸機三者組成水洩不通的空陸一體的有機體。</p>
<p>我們的敵人，不止是正面的陣地，背後也不時有游擊隊擾亂。摩爾陣前，日夜擊戰二星期，四月二十日以後，我以一部當敵正面，主力不能不向後方開始轉進。空挺部隊的特徵，就是時常腹北受敵游擊的威脅。近來摩爾，印杜間長僅三十公里的我後方補給路，因敵空挺部隊的侵入，而瀕於危機。敵以英美將校所指揮的一中隊爲一部，分散各地，建造飛機場，等待從空中投下物料，展開擾亂後方的游擊戰。</p>
<p>首受密林戰訓練的格爾加兵，渝軍等，隱於北緬特有的密林中，出沒無常，備有手榴彈，自動步槍等取敏速的游擊攻勢。在汽車道上數設地雷，破壞我載貨車，而後以迫擊砲射擊。</p>
<p>敵人的總崩潰</p>
<p>但陸地終究是我軍奮戰的舞台。轉進以後，轉進以後，二星期間就已消減了此方面的空挺隊。而結束了掃蕩戰的我軍部隊，五月初旬再返回摩爾陣地，準備總攻擊的態勢。已經喪失了前哨陣地的敵方戰意，頓見低落。五月十一日，實施總攻擊的前夜，機首總有照明燈的敵機，夜間向我陣地前來轟炸，掃射。從陸地來的格爾加兵一齊出動，敷獲此夜的總退却，天色一明，定時炸彈即絡續爆發。整個陣地像死去一樣，化爲烟海。美渝兩軍運輸機逃亡。格爾加兵，渝軍則更向北方潰走。喪失了老窠摩足的敵人瀕於總崩潰，摩爾西北方的敵堅壘奈米克拉特人影也沒有。另以一部擊減逃至北方奈米庫因陣地的敵人，其殘餘部隊則向孟拱，密芝那方面敗走。敵人企圖奪回緬甸的美夢，盡成泡影，一面并開拓了向最前綫陣地補給的大路。</p>
<p>敵空挺部隊的弱點在於降落時的一霎那。沒有地上機動力的空挺隊，最怕的是空中補給的限制與孤立所造成的恐怖感。最初降落後，從居民的宣撫到機場設定，陣地的構築，均爲最先着手應做的事，然後始由空中補給逐漸强化戰力。所以最所希望的是在降落的當初就加以擊落。（譯自十月十一日讀賣新聞）</p>
<h3>與日本呼應　德國一億人民總蹶起</h3>
<p>上次大戰的末期，德國在提議休戰前不久，其防綫東方遠在島克蘭，愛沙尼亞，西方則在比利時，法蘭西境內，而巴爾幹又在同盟國奧大利，匈牙利的控制之下，此外，保加利亞和土耳其亦爲德國的友邦，想起了這種情形時，就可了解在這次戰爭中，以本國爲「要塞」而堅持戰事的德國，其情况是如何悲壯了。</p>
<p>根據凡爾賽和約，德國本部面積爲四十六萬八百五十萬，但自一九三五年恢復薩爾區域起，由於合併奧國和捷克瓦解等，德國遂成面積六十三萬六千平方公里，人口八千七十萬的大國。一九三九年開始對英戰爭以後，在日益擴大的德軍佔領地中。</p>
<p>先併波蘭走廊等後，一九四一年三月末，南斯拉夫背叛德國，旋即崩潰，翌月十日克羅地亞國誕生時，德國便與其締結條約，合併凱倫登，北克拉印，下修泰埃爾瑪克三地（人口百萬）。如斯，可認爲德國本部的地域，面積共有八十六萬平方公里，擁有人口一億一千萬，幅員比日本大四分之一，人口多十分之一，但波蘭總督轄境（人口一千萬）與西部邊境地區（人口二百三十萬）已爲敵軍所侵，故能澈底動員而決定歐洲回天之舉的德國國民數，現在亦爲一億，可和盟邦日本「一億悲蹶起」的口號相通，真巧得很！（譯自十月七日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>歸宿</h3>
<p>— 金毓明</p>
<p>「佬鄉別說癆病，這是有錢買不到的富貴病！」</p>
<p>五號病榻上的「老槍」，尚且「幸災樂禍」地嘲解着說。「癆病」二字，真壓煩得他「刺耳驚心」了！</p>
<p>「寶貴病？老天爺偏給窮小子害這半死不活的癆病，死，媽的快些！」</p>
<p>瘦骨嶙嶙的佬鄉，依然改不了當年的「英雄氣概」，他恨「死神」降臨得不痛快，爲什麼愛兜着灣兒。</p>
<p>「死，怕沒有那樣便當，咱們活着的罪還沒受了，這呌做慢性自殺！」</p>
<p>「慢性自殺」？佬鄉給楞住了，他不懂這「新名詞」，他的確不及「假佬鄉」會說話。</p>
<p>「就是你越想早死，閻羅王越不傳令，守你血乾了，肉完了，再請你瞌上眼皮。」</p>
<p>話越說越糟，惹得一房的病人，都全體肅坐，蹙眉打結，用手按住贏弱的胸膛，痰，怪吃力地從咳嗽中迸出來，誰都好像自己的生命，給宣判了死刑似的。</p>
<p>「照你說，我們的病，死是必定了？針藥是騙騙人的？」歲數最輕的少年，帶了絕望詢問，問道「假佬鄉」，控索着求生的眼光。</p>
<p>「傻子，機器旣少了一個螺絲，人的肺，怎可以爛，病菌每天啃，東一個洞，西一個口，那還活得了！」毫不忌肆地給那少年人迎上一棒，連那灰黯的夢，都給粉碎了。</p>
<p>「阿弟，別信他，你比不上咱們，俺在你的年紀，正在走碼頭，稱英雄的時節，要是不聚家婆，也沒孩子，誰在上海成天攢在那地窖里吃煤灰……咳，十年，八年，風雨晝夜，媽的，就是一架機器……。」</p>
<p>一陣猖獗的咳嗽，打斷了他的哀痛的訴說，倚靠在床枕上，撫摸着胸口。像是要從他的話裏，思索些什麼。</p>
<p>「千言萬語，你還不是和我同樣害了「生活的病」，現在誰手頭有這麼十萬八萬，病就不用愁了。」</p>
<p>「說的是呀，奄有錢，也有會害甚麼癆病了，財富的人家，那會生這一種病！」</p>
<p>從前的佬鄉，最恨金錢，他只知道用力氣換飯吃，如今做了一「病」的俘虜，不期而然地對金錢的　屈服了。</p>
<p>「各位老是錢呀病的，躺躺養養，別空談，費精神！」一直躺着諦聽的窮敎員，出於善意地解勸他們。</p>
<p>說真的，他們都是一夥同病相憐的窮苦病者，歷年來的生活，絞盡他們的汗血，呼吸在那些被人摧殘的壓榨的環境裏。憂愁，積悒，痛苦在他們的日子裏，沒有一天間斷過。勞着，病着，他們的臉上始終找不到快樂，像一座陰沈的古老屋子，心中永遠沉着一塊石頭。也有受到刺激的，爲了別的煩悶的，他們都懦怯得不敢發洩，把一切苦痛都悶在這瘦小的愁葫蘆裏。逐漸，他們的呼吸管有點喘，他們的肺藥上，代替他們心裏的愁慘，刻下了暗澹的斑痕。時間是彫刻的工具，一綫一綫地，一塊一塊地，做了結束人生的工匠。有的，更美麗的加上了彩色，鮮紅的一口口的躣出口腔，像報告他們的主人，我已完成到甚麼樣的階段了似的。</p>
<p>這醫院，救治了很多平民的生命。無力療養的病者，在手續完備內，院方總是收容他們的，醫藥，膳宿，數十年來，熱心的慈善家，熬費了不少苦心。無奈，目今生活飛漲，院方的經濟，也像患了貧血病，籌措感到困難了</p>
<p>晚霞，燦爛地散在天空，屋裏的人，誰也沒有閒逸的心情，去欣賞那自然界的美了。他們的心，正幻想着接踵在黃昏後面的黑暗靜寂的，沉死的。</p>
<p>掛在床檔上的濕度記錄表，從這端到那踹，却像一連串的喜馬拉雅山的高峯，很少有留在水平綫上的。Coasuleu的針，仍舊阻止不信盈口的鮮血。他們的體重，像卸貨的卡車，慢慢地減輕下來。——無疑的，被蠢食到病魔的血口裏了。</p>
<p>恐怖，緊隨了夜；伸展，擴大。在點近少年的床舖上，躺着一個「行將就木」的軀體，臉色像一方灰白色的漆布，胸腔內如有一　給水溶解了的石灰，沸騰得亂搗——但他沒有呻吟，他僅有喉管裏的短短的喘息，連緊着最後的一綫生命。他沒有遺言，他鄉之客，他衹向那一方島黑的天，隱約露出最後的微笑。</p>
<p>風打動樹葉，奏出莫名的悲哀。屋子如恐怖的森林；每個人的心，却像一頭被獵射的驚鳥，震悸得發顫。</p>
<p>少年眼睜地看那些白衣人，在暗淡的燈光中走動，白布蒙上那人的臉，隔離了他的幽魂，脫離苦痛，訣別他的同伴，優遊在另一個世界裏了。</p>
<p>晨曦還是和平地照射到那張空床上，病人們不時投了不可議的眼光，尤以這少年的心頭，橫着一件畏怯的沉重的事情；他開始對自己懷疑，對於這一張空床有着無可磨減的印象，獨有「厭世者」的佬鄉，在替死者祝着幸福；他感覺到人生沒有貪戀的意味，他不忍目睹他的妻兒，爲了他演那慘痛的悲劇。他哀求死神早日安葬他的靈魂，得一歸宿，是日，死者沒有一個來憑弔的家屬，他終於給普善山荘運走了。</p>
<p>緘默不久，這一間病房內，談話的聲音又起了。他們似乎在攀談窮人們的命運，遭遇委實太不近人情了。生活的苦難，已够他們一世享受，爲什麼再要加上病的折磨；並且偏挑選如此難以救藥的病。這無異處人死地，造物竟爲他們安置這般的殘酷結局。</p>
<p>院長，醫生，護士都從別的病房走了進來，病人們都鎮靜地躺下，這在他們視爲唯一的救星，針藥以及療養膳宿，院方從不向他們索取一個錢，他們感覺到莫大的恩澤，這不但救了他們這一羣，並且也無異連帶救了他們的妻子，孩子——。</p>
<p>但是不然，好景不常，今天院長那番悲天憫人而無力爲助的話，直刺每個人的心胸，臉色蒼白，大家都夢囈似的說着：</p>
<p>「半月以後—」</p>
<p>他們確實不能相信。這是一場惡夢。</p>
<p>離開病院，在他們和離開了這世界又有甚麼二樣？</p>
<h3>評在藝的「慾魔」</h3>
<p>— 風影</p>
<p>……「欲魔」原爲俄國托爾斯泰所著，而這一次中國藝術劇團乃是根據歐陽予倩的中文改編本而搬演的，原文我未曾讀過，因此無從把牠們作一個比較。而中藝所介紹的「慾魔」給我的感覺是這樣的…—</p>
<p>……世界上的人竟是如此的愚蠢而不長進啊！劇本中的人物該已是幾十年以前的人了，然而仍舊和現在的人差不多。我是說：現在的人大多仍舊與之不相上下而未見有所進步，反是後者尚還不及劇中前人的天真和敦厚。他們妒忌，貪得，而缺少理智；做事爲人是那樣的沒有倫次。事前沒有一個人知道自己所做的事是「不可活」的，一直要到最後，事情已經進展到不可收拾了，才知罪，才發現良心的存在。甚而有些人，一直到臨終還不知道自己的弱點和錯誤，無知地在天地間播下了痛苦之因。世界上的人竟是如此的愚蠢而不長進！卒不能克服慾念的魔障，而始終逃不出欲魔的手掌心。</p>
<p>……導演芳信先生是一位刻苦的學者，曾經翻譯過好幾部俄人作品，如「欽差大臣」便是其中之一。雖然譯文多由日文轉譯過來，而非直接譯自俄文者，然而芳信先生對於俄國文學是有相當的認識和研究的，導演源自俄文的戲猶若輕車熟路。拿前年爲中青導演的「大雷雨」來說，不是就有着好的成績而深得人心嗎？衹是在芳信先生導演下的演員，總要有相當的藝術思想和理解能力才行。且看出演於「慾魔」中的中藝學員們：凡是聰明的，在臺上都能發揮其演技而與戲中人之身份相稱；那些較忠厚的，在臺上就未免僵呆可笑而使人有木偶的感覺。由是可知芳信先生實在能够鼓勵演員，放任演員，而給演員們以相當的地位，郤不能如吳仞之導演先生之能够啓發演員，幫助、俾斯員細心地創造劇中人的意境和個性。多數的演員是浮躁欠穩定的。然而能將一些初學的演員們下工夫排練得有如此的成績，把「慾魔」貢獻在人們的面前，導演者的功勞，不可抹殺。</p>
<p>……咬字和發音的欠準確，是全台演員的大毛病，對詞和讀上少下了一番工夫的。</p>
<p>……演花月英的華苓，聲調太平，該哭的時候哭不出來；該笑時又不敢放心地笑，在全劇中出場和說話的機會旣多，多少損壞了些應有的可能的成就，衹是在逼其夫李奇埋葬嬰孩的一幕中，沈毅潑辣，似恨似怒，演來十分精彩。錢慧飾演的李洪氏，尖鄙有餘而精明不足，蓋身體顛搖得太厲害，而斜眼又做得太多，一個肚子裏很會計算而心眼兒很窄的老太婆，不該這樣活潑而輕浮的。分飾張裕福，小銀，鄰女等的樂天，清湘等，也都還錯。飾長女小金的吳蓋，活潑可取，衹是任性隨便的很，幸而演員本人習慣的動作與劇中人的身分恰可符合，因此倒反而顯得自然。而演員中演來最優的當爲飾演李奇的耘野及王秀英的莎易，一舉手一投足皆可謂無懈可擊，而嗓音清脆，抑揚頓挫，尤其恰到好處。</p>
<p>……燈光和化裝及服裝等也都可說是無有瑕疵。至於裝置和佈景，私心認爲有一幕李奇家中的陳設佈景，總不該如此乾淨和整潔！因爲即使是一個最粗心的觀劇者吧，也會想到：一個鄉下農人的茅屋裏怎麼會有如此綫塵不染的牆壁和爐灶呢。</p>
<p>……對於年青辛勞的中藝，似乎不該說上這麼許多話，有點近乎吹毛求疵的樣子，然而對於這些正在學習中的演員和戲劇工作者，一味地誇獎，豈不更爲無益而有害？但願他們能够不斷地學習，不斷地實驗，憑着上演「慾魔」的這一份熱忱和信念，繼續努力，前途正無限量！筆者謹寄以熱切的希望。本文也可以算是期待於更佳的成績顯現於劇壇的一個前奏吧！（卅三年十月廿八日）</p>

<h3>申報盃籃球賽半途中　論三強隊實力</h3>
<p>— （梅必賢）</p>
<p>華聯汕隊中北均有冠軍希望</p>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽，戰程巳及一半，强者勝，弱者敗，已成公例。目下保持當勝地位者唯華聯與汕隊二隊，失敗一次而仍具有希望者爲中北一隊，餘則皆有二次以上之敗績，故諭之爭奪冠軍者唯此三隊而已。錄最近形勢表：</p>
<p>茲乘上週並無冷門之出，爰作評談三有希望之强隊：</p>
<p>華聯藥廠希望最濃</p>
<p>華聯藥廠爲西靑最後一屆之錦標隊，唯自得該項錦標後，該隊仍積極練習，從未中輟。其精神之佳，實非他隊可比。以此共球藝之進步，乃與日俱增也。在申報盃中五戰皆捷，勝分總屬相當之多，其收獲固絕無倖致。評其實力，首爲純熟，次則爲各隊員之能知彼知己，而少破綻之處。對於戰術而言，華聯能排多種方法，其主要點，即爲能攻人之短，利用自己長處。尤可貴者，上塌五將，均有射籃能力，其缺點則似爲兩後衛過於心曠神怡，略見速度不够，及在破對方五人聯防法時，應用檔人烟幕之法，未見純熟。最先上陣者，必爲如此陣容。</p>
<p>張良雄　瞿錫麟</p>
<p>吳成章</p>
<p>范慶公　孔廣益</p>
<p>談此五虎之近况，常推吳成章最有顯著之進步，其籃下刦球，賴其彈力之足，與夫時間地位之準，什得七八，難能可貴。張良雄之特點，爲善放冷箭，且擅守人，唯極一可能有失當之表演爲憾。范慶公之盤傅功夫及投籃手法，已恢復其在北平時之雄風。此子仍嫌理論多於事實，說得到而做不到之處不免，殆亦正在踏上爐火純靑之境。）錫麟有輕鬆之鏡頭，花巧之手術，門檻又精，不媿固中老將也。阿孔雖老，但最近拍球之勇，誰謂阿孔老矣。投籃更有神技，依然不失一員主將。</p>
<p>汕隊小將後生可畏</p>
<p>汕隊自擊敗中北後，籃壇震驚。實則汕隊領隊林作詩確巳付下一番苦功與心血，毫無偶然，後生可畏。嗣後戰程中，唯華聯是敵，對於錦標，具有絕大希望也。其隊員以年事正輕，故演出貴神速。三鋒三小將俱短小精悍，如生龍活虎。綜論其攻因爲速度及聯絡默契，射籃準確，頗有成功，考其守禦時，尚嫌不堅堅凑。蓋各個之地位，猶立得並不理想，其陣容大致爲</p>
<p>林維聽　周斌</p>
<p>紀南康</p>
<p>陳清江　馬燦希</p>
<p>其中當以老馬識途爲攻守之魂，而陳淸生殺搏善竄，尤爲成功之新將。林維聰固爲獲分之鍮，然有二缺點：一，爲其投籃有順逆，不可穩取。二，如逢看守者知其球路，極易關煞，不能絕處覓生。紀南康爲隊員中資格最淺者，然小紀之穩健作風，固無讓一般老將也。孺子可敎。周斌之衛，勇有餘，腦筋尚嫌不淸，故時見有猛衝受痛之處。</p>
<p>中北雖敗　尙有可爲</p>
<p>中北雖敗於汕隊一役，然尚有可爲。蓋華聯如勝汕隊，最後之戰爲中北華聯之鬥，屆時能獲得勝利，則又將成一單循環。溯之中北之演出，各個球藝，確臻上乘，且以其另其一種功夫，極博球迷歡迎。因其如此，隊員乃頗少練習，乃合作方面，吃虧一聲耳。季初又犯下初出馬之生疎病，於是非但表演未能合乎理想，抑且有調整無主之狀。槪論之，北派作風，爲一無主心主義之派，各顯本人絕技耳。照其戰明星下半時之作風，其理想人頭應爲：</p>
<p>震中賴其天賦，其動作美麗之處，所縈迴球迷腦際，不愧國手，近見其力有不足之感。據云，以病後，元氣未復，不無關係。學崇似無當年咤叱之風雲，其跨大步籃下托入一球，已難多請。所可取者，獲球穩。在籃下藍球避人而射，仍見妙不可言。　恭能攻而少守，一貫之作風，其左手騰空彎背而峻射，乃怪球而敵無法遏制者。過去有百發百中之事實，本屆突見惡運臨頭，十不得一，豈流年不利耶？萬一此球恢復成功，則聿恭之威名，還是可長。國榮之氣够及經騐，與北派之作風，有相同之處，故在中北隊中，固看不出其本屆新加入之一員也。賓中身手極爲靈活，然筆者頗覺其時常會莫名其妙受到犯規處罰，減少其威風爲可惜，寶中不怕兇狠，倒怕乖和巧。總之，賽中總屬上乘之材。</p>
<p>秩序單，以上三强，華聯汕隊將先逢於月之十五日，而華聯中北則爲甲組賽中之末一場節目（二十七日）三强均在養精蓄銳，相逢之外，籃球房內必要演出空前盛况。</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要（三）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>二·個人進攻基本技術</p>
<p>籃球運動，欲求水準提高，非從個人進攻基本技術下功夫不可。基本動作若不純熟；則全隊合作一與進攻戰略，皆不足談。查滬上球隊隊數雖多，但多數無良好指導，担任訓練。故比賽固無戰略，而個人進攻基本技術亦甚幼稚；球員每犯貪高慕遠，與不耐煩之弊。對基本動作，不肯留心練習，亦不發生興趣。常見球員，雖身經百戰，而其投籃技術，每十不中一。跑動時足跟先觸地，傳球非過高即過低；用力非過强即過柔；持球不放在腹間掩護，遇敵亦不諳以「旋轉」避開。甚致慌忙不知所措，結果致全隊費力得來之球，即因此種個人技術錯誤，而被對方奪回，影響全隊進攻機會。此皆個人基本技術，缺乏訓練之故也。其實籃球遝動，如其他學術一樣，基本技術，非嚴格訓練，耐心研究，與不斷熟習不爲功。籃球基本技術；包含有傅球，接球，投籃，「拍球」，「旋轉」等，茲將其比校州重要者，分述如下：</p>
<p>任何籃球員，其最要之條件，爲諸熟持球、否則在一次比賽中，其不應失落而失落之球，次數之多，常出人意料之外。若球一旦失落，非僅影響本隊之進攻機會，幷有被對方將球奪去之可能性，甚而竟因此被對方多投進一球。而此一球或即可奠定對方最後之勝利，其嚴重性，由此可想而知。</p>
<p>查球失落之原因，大槪有下列數端，不可不留意：（一）兩目不注視球；（二）接球時手指不儘量張開，而常伸直正對傳來之球，兩手不向下或向上，作碗形式接球；（三）接球時手腕與手肘太硬；（四）傳來之球，傳得太高太低，或離身邊太遠</p>
<p>傳球距離愈近，失球之次數愈多，因愈近則愈迅速，接球者每在球未接得之光，兩目即注視尋覓同伴傳出，反而不注視所接之球。故接球時，兩日應先注視球，同時宜一面一接，一面用眼角，找尋同伴，非至球接得後，兩目實不應離開傅來之球。</p>
<p>最適當而易接之球，應傅至腰間，或近肩之處；過高過低，均所不宜；若傅到近頭部，勢將使接球者迅速低頭閃避，擾亂一其視綫，而致失落。故球一應在胸腹之間接得，手指宜向上或向下張開，手肘彎曲，及手腕使之柔順。球來時先使之觸及手掌，然後將手指合緊握球，手肘與肩部宜放鬆，隊球之來勢而稍有伸縮性，使球不易脫出，同時使所撫摩之球，置於易傅出之位置，方爲完善之接球。</p>
<h3>健身訓練簡易法（二）（三）</h3>
<p>— 湯姆著一德譯</p>
<p>直立，身體之重心平分於左右二足，手又腰際。胸部盡力挺直，但兩足不可離地，雖足根稍微提起亦不可。兩足自然之姿勢，爲足跟並合，足尖分開；今當反其道而行之，使足尖並合，而足跟緩：向左右分開，先移左足，次移右足，（或先右後左）其距離愈遠愈佳，惟足尖仍須接觸，身體挺直。</p>
<p>腰背運動手又腰際；身體挺直；足尖並合；足跟分開。</p>
<p>注意祇須一次，即覺輕鬆。</p>
<p>卅八木馬曾坐過木馬乎</p>
<p>學者亦曾坐過木馬乎？比事大有益處。其特別目的，即在使腿肌有彈性，而舉足累快。若閉口運動，兼能節制呼吸，擴充肺量。不　運動時宜閉口，即運動已畢，仍須閉口，至呼吸如常始止，</p>

<h3>Fierce Air Battles over Leyte: Japanese Forces Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Imperial Headquarters Announces Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 4th: (1) Japanese ground forces on Leyte Island are currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy near the highlands west of Tacloban and Talac. From the enemy's landing until October 30th, the following results of the land battles have been confirmed: Over 4,500 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, 12 enemy tanks destroyed, and enemy naval vessels damaged by land-based artillery, including one cruiser destroyed, one destroyer sunk and another destroyed, 115 landing craft sunk and destroyed, and 20 enemy aircraft set ablaze or destroyed while attempting to take off. (2) Japanese air units swiftly attacked the enemy in the vicinity of Leyte Island, inflicting heavy damage, particularly from the night of November 2nd to dawn on the 3rd, repeatedly and fiercely attacking the Tacloban and San Pablo airfields and enemy naval vessels off Talac, achieving the following results: Over 110 enemy aircraft set ablaze or destroyed, 20 airfield facilities set ablaze, one transport ship set ablaze, and five Japanese aircraft lost.</p>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American's reinforced Tacloban airfield, after being thoroughly attacked by Japanese forces from the night of the 2nd to dawn on the 3rd, exhibited weakness in its attacks on the Philippines on the 3rd, with only 32 aircraft operating in the Luzon area, 21 in the Visayas (mainly large aircraft), and 11 in Mindanao, totaling 64 aircraft, mostly for reconnaissance purposes.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Heavily Bombs Enemy Airfields Day and Night</p>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) – From noon to 8:00 PM on the 2nd, Japanese air units engaged 40 enemy B-24s and 50 P-38s in fierce air battles over the western part of Leyte Island, resulting in one B-24 and five P-38s shot down, and 11 B-24s and P-38s destroyed. Fierce air battles also took place east of Leyte Island on the 2nd, with Japanese forces shooting down nine American aircraft and one P-38. An additional B-24 was reportedly destroyed but not confirmed.</p>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese reconnaissance on the morning of the 2nd, the Tacloban airfield held 130 large enemy aircraft and 70 medium-sized aircraft. In order to thoroughly destroy them, Japanese army and naval air forces attacked the airfield from the night of the 2nd to 7:00 AM on the 3rd, causing half of the over 200 enemy aircraft lined up on the runway to catch fire instantly, with large fires breaking out in several places. Japanese aircraft safely returned to base after completing their mission.</p>
<p>Manila, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese army aviation units heavily bombed American air bases on Leyte Island on the night of the 2nd, setting ablaze the Talac airfield in two locations and the Florohen airfield in one location. It is also reported that night patrol aircraft were patrolling the American airfields that night, and the anti-aircraft fire near Talac was quite intense, indicating that the American air force in the area is still considerably strong.</p>
<h3>"Tenryu" and "Plum Blossom" Units Follow Up, Displaying Spirit of Human Torpedoes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – Following the distinguished service of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Shikishima Unit, the Chujun and Totsugeki Units have continued to launch, unleashing the spirit of sure-kill human torpedoes to annihilate the enemy, shaking the enemy's spirit. Recently, new "Tenryu" (Heavenly Dragon) and "Plum Blossom" units have achieved magnificent results in the Leyte Gulf area, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 3rd. On the 1st of this month, at approximately 9:30 AM, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Tenryu Unit, upon receiving intelligence that an enemy mobile unit had been spotted east of Surigao, immediately departed from its base, fiercely breaking through the enemy's direct escort fighters and charging into the enemy mobile unit. Identifying a cruiser as its target, one aircraft suddenly descended and crashed directly into the enemy warship, immediately causing it to catch fire and explode. Whether it sank has not been confirmed. Another aircraft struck an enemy cruiser or destroyer, causing it to explode instantly, with black smoke billowing into the sky. Furthermore, a Japanese direct escort fighter responded by dropping a bomb, hitting an enemy cruiser. The sinking of these three enemy warships has not been confirmed due to the fierce enemy direct escort fighter resistance, but it is expected that they will all sink eventually. Also on the same day, another unit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit daringly attacked a fleet of several enemy battleships, cruisers, and destroyers sailing south from Leyte Gulf. One aircraft struck an enemy cruiser, sinking it, while another aircraft crashed into an enemy cruiser, with the results unclear. At the same time, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit Plum Blossom Unit also attacked an enemy battleship sailing south through the Palawan Strait at the southern end of Leyte Gulf after 6:00 PM that afternoon. One aircraft struck its foremast, immediately causing a large fire, with black smoke billowing into the sky, and the ship stopped sailing and listed to starboard. However, due to heavy fog, it could not be confirmed whether it sank. On the other hand, on the 1st of this month, at 8:30 AM, Japanese air units spotted a fleet of enemy ships, including cruisers and destroyers, west of Homonhon Island in Leyte Gulf and immediately launched a fierce attack, torpedoing and sinking one cruiser and two destroyers, and causing another destroyer to explode and sink. Furthermore, on the morning of the 2nd, at approximately 6:00 AM, an enemy transport ship was bombed and sunk in the Surigao Strait.</p>

News from Tacloban reports that during a Japanese air raid on Tacloban, while strafing with machine guns, a bullet entered the office of General MacArthur, commander of the American landing operations in the Philippines. The bullet's trajectory was only twelve inches from MacArthur's head, making MacArthur's escape a near-death experience.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacks Northern Kuriles; One Shot Down</h3>

<h3>Elite Japanese Forces Occupy Gongcheng and Yangshuo; Guilin City Under Heavy Attack from Three Sides</h3>
<p>For nearly two months, this reporter has had the opportunity to travel along the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Tianjin, and Jiangpu lines, and the situations have been detailed in previous dispatches. As the Greater East Asia War approaches a decisive phase, the recent Allied victories in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy Americans, further solidifying the foundation for victory. All East Asian nations are rejoicing and eagerly awaiting the arrival of final victory. The Chinese nation is a vital part of Greater East Asia, and at this crucial juncture, it is especially important to intensify the war effort and strive forward. However, under the current circumstances in China, the only path forward is to increase production and contribute resources. This reporter's observations along the way have revealed many contradictory phenomena regarding increased production. Although resource contributions have not ceased, they seem to be approaching a point of exhaustion, which is not a sustainable solution. Based on actual observations, the following humble suggestions are offered:</p>
<p>(1) Advocating Increased Production Must Be Thorough: In recent years, the authorities have emphasized increased production, established institutions, recruited talent, and spared no effort in promoting the work. Today's meetings and tomorrow's lectures may excite people in the cities, but deeper observation in the rural areas shows that it has not been fully implemented, which can be criticized as neglecting the fundamentals. It is questionable what the long-term effects will be. For example, in a village in Jiangpu, which is very close to the capital, this reporter has repeatedly asked farmers whether they were moved by the government's emphasis on increased agricultural production and the establishment of institutions to promote it in recent years, but they were completely unaware. Later, inquiries were made at relevant agencies, such as township and village offices, but none seemed interested. Some claimed to have seen it in the newspapers, and others claimed to have received one or two documents about increased production, but in short, it had no effect. This situation needs to be urgently adjusted. Efforts should be made to make the work of promoting increased production in rural areas practical, otherwise, this work will only be a shouting match in the cities and will not penetrate the rural areas, making it difficult to achieve any real results.</p>
<p>(2) Ensuring Security and Eliminating Excessive Taxes and Levies: The people in the rear are responsible for the important task of increasing production, and at the very least, they must be able to obtain the minimum security of life in order to engage in production. This reporter has found that there are very few villages with good security, and excessive taxes and levies at every level have become a common problem in various places. Most farmers groan under the heavy burden. Even in the suburbs of the capital, there are unscrupulous people who forcibly collect firewood. Farmers are struggling to survive, how can they increase production?</p>
<p>(3) In-Kind Tax Collection Should Be Simplified: In order to adapt to the wartime system, the government is implementing in-kind tax collection. When this reporter visited various rural areas, farmers often added to their worries when discussing this matter. This is because this matter is a new initiative and there are no established rules to follow. In particular, unscrupulous village chiefs, township chiefs, and district chiefs have long been full of tricks to exploit the villagers, and now that they have such an opportunity to change things, they will naturally take advantage of it to enrich themselves. This matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that the authorities will publish a clear and understandable method for determining the amount to be paid, the payment procedures, and the transportation and storage of the goods. This will allow farmers to have something to follow and prevent any possible abuses.</p>
<p>As for electricity restrictions, they should be reasonably adjusted in order to increase the power of production factories. Transportation agencies should be thoroughly improved in order to facilitate smooth transportation and clear goods. All localities are extremely expectant.</p>
<h3>Elite Japanese Forces Occupy Gongcheng and Yangshuo; Guilin City Under Heavy Attack from Three Sides</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from the Japanese front lines in Guangxi, elite Japanese forces, in response to the attack on Guilin, overcame the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing 20th Army's heavy artillery fire and occupied Gongcheng (65 kilometers southeast of Guilin) on the morning of the 2nd. Another powerful Japanese unit occupied Yangshuo (60 kilometers south of Guilin), a key point between Guilin and Pingle, at 10:00 AM on the 3rd, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters reporter in Chongqing, the situation in Guilin is as follows: Japanese forces are attacking Guilin from the north, south, and east. The Chongqing army is defending the city from a high ground three kilometers outside the city, resisting strongly. The area around Guilin is full of hills two to three hundred feet high, and the hills are full of caves, making it a natural fortress. The Japanese forces south of Guilin are moving west in order to completely encircle Guilin, while the Japanese forces southeast of Guilin are continuing to advance south to link up with the troops advancing west along the West River. According to Chongqing officials, powerful Chongqing forces are attempting to cut off the Japanese railway and highway transportation lines near Dong'an in northeastern Guangxi Province. Whether this move can alleviate the strong pressure on Guilin depends on future developments. Also, according to American military sources, a Japanese unit has reached an American air base eight kilometers east of Guilin.</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – In response to the capture of Guilin, the Japanese vanguard, breaking through the treacherous Doupangling, capturing Fuchuan, and advancing further west, attacked Pingle, a key point south of Guilin, on the night of the 1st, eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing 37th Army, and launching a night raid, finally occupying it at 11:00 PM that night.</p>
<p>Advancing on Yongfu, Occupying Sishiwei - Hengyang, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Japanese front lines in Guangxi, rapid Japanese forces encircled the Chongqing New 8th Division and the New 19th Division, which had escaped from Guilin, near Yongfu, 35 kilometers south of Guilin in the evening. A general offensive was launched on the morning of the 3rd. One unit of Japanese forces crossed the Guijiang River and advanced on Yongfu, whose fall is imminent.</p>
<p>American Officers Appear on Guilin Front - Hunan Front, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese forces on the West River in Guangxi Province occupied Jiangkouxu, a key point upstream, on the 28th of last month. It is reported that an American officer participated in the first line of the battle. The Japanese forces seized a large number of American-made clothing and equipment from the captured Chongqing army positions. It has been reported that American officers have been supervising the battle on the Hunan front before, and now they have reappeared on the Guangxi front.</p>
<h3>Minister Mishina Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Resident Army China Dispatch Department Chief Mishina gave a talk, fourth of the month, contents as follows:</p>
<p>Guilin is under the intense siege of elite Japanese forces and is extremely terrified. The Japanese offensive in China is completely contrary to the enemy's claim that "the Japanese offensive has reached its maximum limit and has no more strength to attack Guilin." Since the Japanese occupation of Hengyang, the British, Americans, and Chongqing have deeply realized the dynamism of the Japanese offensive. Previously, when Changsha fell in June, I stated that the daydreams and wishful thinking of the British, Americans, and Chongqing, that Japan's war power had been consumed in the Pacific or Southwest Asia and that it had no remaining strength to attack, would be answered with solemn facts and warnings by this operation.</p>
<p>Regarding the reconstruction of the occupied territories, the areas along the Pinghan Railway, such as Luoyang and Zhengzhou, are already progressing smoothly, not to mention the Hunan area. All reconstruction work has yielded results beyond expectations. The peaceful and prosperous lives of the local people are sufficient proof. The most notable among them is General Fang Xianjue, a brave Chongqing general in the Battle of Hengyang, who is now leading his troops to form the Xianji Army, full of determination to build a self-reliant nation, and is responsible for the self-defense and reconstruction of his hometown of Hunan. General Fang's autonomous armistice and assumption of reconstruction work in the still-smoldering battlefield of Hunan is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>Currently, the British and American expeditionary forces and air forces invading East Asia have been defeated by the Japanese forces in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and mainland China. In particular, the southwestern aviation fortress, which the enemy calls the unsinkable aircraft carrier of mainland China, Guilin, is about to fall. Consider Stilwell's forcible seizure of unified command in China, Chennault's scorched-earth bombing regardless of friend or foe, and Roosevelt's insidious schemes, which stem from their ambition to control China and the imperialist plot to turn China into a slave market. Is it true that China cannot maintain its state without the help of such demons? It is believed that all intelligent people and leaders in China can search their own hearts and ask themselves this question.</p>
<h3>A Path to Liberation from British and American Oppression: Special Lecture by Minister Kishi</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi Weiichi, Minister of Information of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a special broadcast at 9:30 PM on the 4th to commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese people's attitude toward the Greater East Asia War over the past year, not to mention Chongqing and Yan'an, seems to be extremely indifferent even among the people in the peace zone. It seems that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have not evoked the expected emotion. Recalling the last World War, although Britain and the United States used such propaganda-valuable slogans as</p>
<p>national self-determination and freedom of the seas as war aims, they have clearly expressed to their own people in this great war that they have lost confidence in their war aims. This can be best proved by Churchill's mere high-pitched call for "war for victory." The Chinese people, even if they assume the victory of Britain and the United States as a premise, show no excitement about the advantageous turn of the British and American war situation in such a war without any purpose, merely fighting to ensure their own unreasonable existence. Chinese people for peace, for victory, both are</p>
<p>not interested. Thinking about the reason, the first is that they do not believe that the victory of Britain and the United States can bring about economic and political improvement as after the last World War. Second, because they only look at the war from the aspect of material quantities, they have the same materialistic ideas as the British and Americans, who only believe that the number of productivity can determine the victory or defeat. Therefore, they did not deeply expect the victory of Japan, resulting in the loss of the mature intention of overall peace. This kind of psychology, in the end, became the reason why Chinese people lack Asian consciousness. In the past British and American</p>
<p>world system, because of the constant changes in the progress of Asia, especially Japan, they could not understand it. Therefore, they still do not have an awareness of the subjectivity of Asia, so they close everything in a "no way" situation as a kind of fatalistic fact, only wanting to seek how to苟安in the old system in order to preserve themselves. Chiang Kai-shek's one China mind ideology is also this.</p>
<p>If the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is compared with the British and American abolition of unequal treaties to Chongqing, and you want to compare them with each other, this is indeed a British and American style of thinking. Although the clauses of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty are simple, they contain</p>
<p>the great hopes and firm determination of the revival of Asia. Therefore, an example of the great psychological revolutionary form of Japan discovered because of the Greater East Asia War is the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. Asia cannot be revived, Japan has no development, and the revival of Asia has become an indispensable condition for China to realize autonomy and independence. All these judgments and determination are all active in this treaty. If you do not think about this important fact, and forget this kind of belief, only from the return of a concession and the abolition of unequal treaties, that is, take concrete measures, and make transactional observations, such as only focusing on the three aspects of things, then</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, and the British and American abolition of unequal treaties shown to Chongqing, in essence, become nothing different. This is because Chinese people in Chongqing have lost the Qing Dynasty-like "Eastern world view of life" of seeing the intangible and hearing the silent. I said on Sunday that the Atlantic Charter is only the war goal pointed out by Britain and the United States, and it can also be said to be an expression of the will of their countries. There is a saying that the Atlantic Charter is concrete and the Greater East Asia Declaration is abstract, and even the conclusion is inclined to that the concrete will have the advantage, but in fact, the British and Americans who want to maintain the status quo have no concrete expression or declaration, but those who are determined to</p>
<p>reform the status quo and realize the ideal of building Greater East Asia also express their determination to take this action. Compared with each other, there is a clear difference. Although the content of the Greater East Asia Declaration is abstract, it has a great ideal and the mature affection of the new East Asian pioneers. If you ignore this, you will mistake the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Atlantic Charter as one. Also, the various behaviors of Britain and the United States are perceptual, while the</p>
<p>everything in East Asia contains history and ethnicity. Even the United States, which has not been established for 300 years, is extremely difficult to have this condition, and the countries participating in the Greater East Asia Declaration all have a history of thousands of years. On this point, there are different points of separation between the two sides.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, intellectuals are deeply poisoned by British and American ideas because they have been rendered by British and American ideas for a long time. At present, we must clearly distinguish the difference between this Western power-oriented thinking and the Eastern spirit of morality. If we cannot transform this concept from the standpoint of East Asia, it will greatly affect</p>
<p>the construction of the future of East Asia. Therefore, the fact that Chongqing cannot establish its own subjectivity, resulting in the inability to immediately realize the independence and autonomy of Asia, is a powerful proof. From this perspective, Japan has already taken on the task of cleaning up British and American ideas, liberating the pioneer of the East Asia War, and then cooperating with the independent autonomy of the East Asian nations. Therefore, Japan sincerely hopes that all East Asian nations who have a sincere responsibility to liberate East Asia are also Japan's powerful friends. So that they can closely cooperate on the same front and move toward the common</p>
<p>people move forward. In short, the essence of the Greater East Asia War, from Japan's standpoint, is to get rid of the aggression of British and American imperialism. From the standpoint of China and other Greater East Asian countries, it is to seek liberation from a position of oppression. Countries that can achieve this policy that adapts to the trend will surely achieve final victory. In the past three years, Japan and the allied East Asian countries, based on this common lofty goal, have cooperated with each other to devote themselves to completing the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve the liberation of East Asia, complete the co-prosperity Greater East Asia construction, so that it can be restored to the original appearance of East Asians, so in the future, we can only march forward to the future of building Greater East Asia according to the meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>

The establishment of our association today is to seek to strengthen the power of propaganda. It is hoped that all members can closely cooperate and intensify work in the future to complete this great mission. Then, New Association General Assembly Vice President Guo gave a speech, saying that the former news cases were the legacy of feudal forces and the tools of individual capitalism.

<h3>Retail Stores Disobeying Price Limits Will Be Investigated and Punished; Statement by Economic Security Department Authorities</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of price controls for retail merchants, the authorities of the Economic Security Department issued the following statement:</p>
<p>The issue of commodity prices is of utmost importance to the stability of people's livelihoods, as all citizens are aware, and need not be elaborated upon. Currently, the prices charged by small retail stores within the city vary greatly. In particular, there are countless instances of illegal price gouging for exorbitant profits, with prices being raised arbitrarily at any time, even changing from morning to evening. This situation is due to a lack of understanding of commodities among the general public and the cunning exploitation of many unscrupulous merchants. Moreover, legitimate merchants are also following the trend, competing to raise prices, leading citizens to believe that this is an inevitable trend. As a result, the efforts of control agencies to suppress prices and implement policies are in vain, prices are soaring, and people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly precarious, which is truly disheartening. Based on the fundamental purpose of food security measures, this department has decided to strictly crack down on unscrupulous merchants. A few days ago, an investigation was initiated, focusing on food stores that are closely related to citizens. On October 27th, unscrupulous merchants were exposed, and those found to be particularly egregious will be severely punished without leniency. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The retail prices of all stores in the city are determined by the respective trade associations and submitted to the administrative authorities for approval and announcement. Strict adherence to these prices is essential, and no violations should be tolerated. If the general public believes that there are abnormal prices, they should check the price list displayed in the store before making a purchase. This crackdown on prices will start with food products and gradually extend to other major commodities. Violators will not be tolerated and will be punished. Merchants must comply with the price limits, and citizens must not hoard or engage in cunning purchases. The main categories of food stores violating price limits are as follows: butcher shops, grain shops, and other general food stores.</p>
<p>The names of the stores violating price limits and their locations on October 27th (× indicates items exceeding price limits): Tongshengxiang, East Changzhi Road; Shenglì, Tiantong Road; Heshenzhen, Fangbang Road; ×ren, Dafangbang Road; Gongcheng, Tiantong Road; Xiechang, Chongde Road; Chunji, East Huaihai Road; Zhengfeng, Zhaojia Road; Hongtai, Zhaojia Road; Zhichang, Zhaojia Road; Wanxing, Zhaozhou Road; Deshengxiang, Zhaozhou Road; ×ren, Dafangbang Road; Renyi, Jiangsu Road; Dafengchangji, Liling Road; Shenkangyu, Tiantong Road; Yuanhe, North Henan Road; Zhaofeng, Xin Xicang Road; Qincheng, Xicang Road; Nianhe, Zhaozhou Road; Wanyuan, Fujian Road; Taichang, Zhaozhou Road; Wansenfu, Zhaozhou Road; Shida Xin, Zhaozhou Road; Wankang, Qimen Road; Changmao, Xikang Road; Meixin, Xikang Road; Shenchengxin, Xikang Road; Wantongshun, Xikang Road; Yuanji, East Changzhi Road; Tongqingyong, Tiantong Road; Tongshunxin, North Henan Road; Zhang Lingxin, North Henan Road; Wanmaocheng, Yongzhou Street; Wanrun, Ningxia Road; Huanqiu, Guangdong Road; Xiefeng, Guangdong Road; Guangtai, Qimen Road; Maolong, Qimen Road; Gongcheng, Jing'an Temple Road; Dalu, Jing'an Temple Road; Asia, Jing'an Temple Road; Cai Hongxing, Yangshupu Road; Zhao Hairong, Wuzhou Road.</p>

<h3>New Alliance's Five Organizations to Celebrate Joint Declaration Anniversary; Lecture Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>On November 6th of last year, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in order to declare their position and resolve to defeat the common enemies of Britain and the United States, issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. One year has passed, and today the East Asia War is entering a stage of certain victory. The battles of Taiwan and the Philippines are powerful evidence of this. At this time, when the Japanese army is launching an operation to annihilate the British and American fleets, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the Shanghai Press Federation, following the "Sweeping Away the American and British Fleets Pre-Celebration Meeting" and the "Celebrating the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Lecture Meeting," has joined with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Chinese National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association to hold the "Celebrating the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration Lecture Meeting" at the Great Light Grand Theater at 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month to celebrate together.

<h3>Minister Matsudaira Broadcasts "The Road to Victory"; Realizing the Ideals of the Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Embassies, broadcast a speech titled "The Road to Victory" on Shanghai Radio at 7:20 PM on the 4th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Rise of Anti-Roosevelt Forces (1) When the Greater East Asia Conference was held on November 5th of last year, I happened to be in Tokyo. Just then, successive announcements were made regarding the great victories in the Battle off Bougainville. I remember that the representatives and staff from various countries participating in the conference all expressed great excitement. Now, on the occasion of the first anniversary of this historic declaration, unprecedented great victories have been achieved in the Pacific. The people of Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia are all expressing excitement together. Conversely, the enemy, the United States, is extremely panicked as a result of this impact. Even as they hold presidential elections, the current administration led by Roosevelt and the Democratic Party are feeling extremely embarrassed. They are vigorously exaggerating the propaganda of the Leyte Gulf landings while at the same time trying their best to conceal the losses they have suffered in the naval battle, even going so far as to publish only the damage they sustained, a mere six ships. However, this operation has had a great impact on the US presidential election. During his third election, Roosevelt was re-elected after a hard-fought battle. This time, his fourth campaign is proving quite difficult, mainly due to the rise of two major anti-Roosevelt forces in his country. The first of these forces is the families of fallen soldiers, and the second is large capital and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Completely Consistent Political and Military Objectives (2) The unification of military affairs, diplomacy, and domestic politics allows national strength to develop greatly, whether in wartime or peacetime. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the strategic and tactical guidelines have been repeatedly decided. Domestic politics and military affairs have been integrated, and the Japanese people all have patriotic hearts and are united around the Imperial Family. Therefore, the unification of politics and military affairs is extremely easy. The Japanese policy toward the Republic of China was clarified to China and abroad in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty of October 31st of last year: goodwill and friendship, respect for autonomy and independence, and close cooperation based on the spirit of morality in the construction of Greater East Asia, contributing to world peace. Any source of trouble hindering Sino-Japanese amity should be removed. Japan assumes this obligation, and at the same time, China assumes this obligation. Any force hindering the achievement of this goal, whether Britain, the United States, or Chongqing, is resolutely swept away. This is the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>
<p>Gathering Strength and Completing the War (3) Our goal is to defeat Britain and the United States and achieve the ideals of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to create a charter for the liberation of the East Asian nations. Our belief is a belief of self-awareness. Its ideal is the dual purpose of defending the motherland and constructing Greater East Asia. We concentrate the greatest strength and apply it to the place most effective for the victory of the war, which is the road to victory. This war is not only a war for the Japanese. For the sake of achieving a common goal, all countries in Greater East Asia have an obligation to strive. We must unite the common comprehensive strength of these comrades-in-arms, either directly participating in the war or indirectly striving to obtain and increase production of materials necessary for the war, providing labor, improving technology, and strengthening transportation capabilities to assist the Greater East Asia War. Then we will surely achieve the common ideals of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Allied Public Opinion High; Unanimously Rise Up and Strive; Talk by Advisor Okura</h3>
<p>Mr. Okura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, returned to his country around the beginning of July of this year for personal matters and recuperated there. He arrived in China on the 1st of this month and arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd. Yesterday (the 4th) at 3:30 PM, he met with Chinese reporters in the city at the Zhengjin Building. Supreme Advisor Okura, accompanied by Mr. Araki Eikichi, Chief Advisor to the National Economic Commission of the National Government, met with them on time. Supreme Advisor Okura then elucidated the rise and revitalization of the Japanese national spirit, unanimously working hard in wartime and emphasizing the economic situation in China. His talk was as follows:</p>
<p>Wartime Japanese Public Opinion High "I returned to my country for about four months and recently returned to China. During my recuperation in my country, I deeply felt the great significance of revitalizing the spirit of the Japanese people. In particular, after the Battle of Saipan, the spirit of the Japanese army's heroic death deeply stirred up the public opinion in the country and brought about a new look. Although there was a change in the Japanese cabinet, with Minister Koiso taking office as Prime Minister, the officials and the people have become more integrated. Therefore, the spirit of the Japanese army on Saipan has had an even greater effect among the people. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia Holy War, the entire nation of Japan rose up together and marched toward the path of destroying the British and American forces. Even after the Battle of Saipan, the situation has become even more revitalized. The current situation is very clear. Under the leadership of the government, every citizen is working hard in their position, firmly believing and striving for the country and for their ancestors. For example, the production of military supplies is already quite considerable. The increase in the production of aircraft and ships is already twice as much as last year. Since the founding of Japan, there have been many difficult and decisive encounters, but the entire nation, especially the people, relying on firm beliefs, have worked hard to overcome difficulties and achieve the greatest victory. This spirit has now reappeared throughout the country. I cannot help but admire Marshal Matsuyama's contribution to the young naval officers and soldiers in the country. I also feel the same, especially the young male and female students, scientists, and technicians in the country, working tirelessly day and night for their positions. Furthermore, the last time enemy American aircraft raided Yawata in Japan and Anshan in Manchuria, the results were all unsuccessful. This shows that the internal air defense countermeasures in this country have been fully prepared and there is no need to worry. In addition, the domestic rice production in the last three years is no different from peacetime. There is no doubt that the situation is very good in terms of consumption and price statistics. Therefore, I felt the happiest during this trip back to my country."</p>
<p>Gathering Resources and Stabilizing People's Livelihoods Regarding the Chinese economic issue, Mr. Okura said, "Japan's economic problem with China is resolved according to the new policy towards China, which is both specific and active, in order to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the purpose of building East Asia, so the stabilization of China's resources is the main focus, especially the stabilization of China's people's livelihoods. Therefore, the results of China's resources in the Greater East Asia War are incumbent. Even if the purpose of the new policy towards China is regarded as a necessary move for the Greater East Asia War, Japan is not dealing with Chongqing in the Greater East Asia battlefield, but is defeating the aggressive policies of the enemy Britain and the United States. The restoration of China's economy in the future will still be done by the Chinese people, but the warlike nature of China's resources and the construction of a new China still take the stabilization of people's livelihoods as a prerequisite. The will of the Chinese and Japanese economic circles is consistent. In the past, views that were inconsistent have been eliminated. Finally, Mr. Okura expressed his research and reasonable improvement of the problems of smooth material control and price suppression in China."</p>
<h3>Dangerous Goods Will Be Registered Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In order to crack down on flammable and explosive dangerous goods, the Municipal Police Department has decided to start implementing registration procedures starting tomorrow (the 6th). From 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, application forms can be obtained from the economic police teams affiliated to the nearest Economic Security Department.

The registration of dangerous goods this time is different from the registration of general goods. Those who resist and fail to register will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>The Department of Industry and Commerce Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Negotiate Special Price Countermeasures</h3>
<p>The Department of Industry and Commerce has recently sent Tao Guoxian, Director of the Commercial Affairs Department, and Lin Dazhong, Director of the Economic Bureau of Nanjing Special Municipality, to Shanghai to consult with Xu Tianshen, Director of the Shanghai Economic Bureau, and relevant agencies. It is reported that a decision has been made on price management, which will be reported to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Renowned Japanese and French Painters Donate Large Buddhist Image</h3>
<p>Buddhist painters from Japan, including Kakuo-zan So-gai, recently requested Ambassador Cai stationed in Japan to transfer a large Guanyin image painted during the Meiji era to China. The Shanghai Buddhist Association held a dedication ceremony at the Yufuo Temple at 10:00 AM on the 10th. The association will send representatives Mi Jia Bai Sheng to Nanjing on the 6th to enshrine it in the Louxia Mountain.</p>
<h3>Details of the Sinking of the Nantong Maru</h3>
<p>Announcement by the Navigation Administration Regarding the accident of the Nantong Maru of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company, which occurred at Xupu at 5:00 AM on October 23rd, the Shanghai Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Construction has dispatched personnel to investigate the incident. The person in charge of the administration announced the investigation as follows:</p>
<p>After receiving the accident report of the Nantong Maru, this administration immediately dispatched personnel to the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company to investigate the cause and process of the accident from the person in charge of the company, the surviving crew members, and the rescued passengers. According to the surviving crew members of the ship, when the ship departed from the port, the lower hold was loaded with 300 bags of wheat, more than 200 live pigs, and 500 *bu* of eggs. Part of the *bu* of eggs were loaded in the second-floor hold, and the third-floor hold was loaded with chicken and duck festival, passengers, and independent passengers with cargo. When the ship reached Tianxingqiao, the second-floor hold was loaded with 66 *lian* of liquor. At around 5:00 AM on October 23rd, the crew was awakened by the tilting of the ship, and it was discovered that the lower hold was taking on water. The crew was panicked, and the order of the passengers was also disrupted. The ship tilted more and more. The piglets in the lower hold were agitated, making it more difficult to stabilize the ship. Before long, it sank. According to the person in charge of the company, the diver sent by the company to investigate the accident site has not yet returned to the company to report, and the details have not yet been determined. The two ships, Xinping and Qingshan, that were sent to the local area have already returned to Shanghai because the water was too deep to salvage. The company has sent Xin Yuan Lun to investigate further. As for the aftermath, the company has established a disaster processing committee to handle it. The exact number of passengers and cargo loaded on the ship when it departed from the port will be announced after receiving a formal report from the local agency. The Nantong Maru had a tonnage of 217 tons and a passenger limit of 670 people. Since this ship was allocated to the company by the naval authorities, it was not inspected by the Navigation Administration and did not go through the registration procedures.</p>
<p>According to the survivors and passengers, there were nearly 2,000 passengers and crew members on the ship this time. The amount of passengers and cargo exceeded the legal limit by too much, causing the accident to be unmanageable.</p>
<p>Based on the above investigation, although the details of the accident have not been fully determined, the person in charge of the company said that the legal passenger limit of the ship was 670 people, and the ship's tonnage was 217 tons. Therefore, it can be imagined that overloading was the main cause of the accident. At this time of wartime system, some shipping is placed under military management. The Nantong Maru was allocated to the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company by the naval authorities of a friendly country. Under special circumstances, all measurement, inspection, and registration matters were not handled by this administration. However, the number of ships whose nationality cannot be determined should not be small. It is hoped that the relevant authorities of friendly countries and the entrusted shipping companies will pay close attention to the measurement and inspection of ships and the assessment and management of ships in the future, and should contact the Navigation Administration to avoid similar incidents from happening again.</p>

<h3>Northern Burma Front: Record of the Annihilation of Enemy Airborne Troops</h3>
<p>In March of this year, enemy airborne troops landed on the Northern Burma front and established a strong defensive position at Mawlu. The fiercest fighting in this battle to annihilate these Burmese airborne troops occurred during the capture of that defensive position. How much power was demonstrated in this scientific war integrating air and land? How did the Japanese army, striking from the periphery, decimate the enemy forces?</p>
<p>A second lieutenant, who participated throughout the airborne suppression operation from India to Myitkyina, wrote the following notes.</p>
<p>Honeycomb-like Stronghold</p>
<p>April 6th: Confrontation with the honeycomb-like stronghold, separated by only sixty-two meters.</p>
<p>This area is a tributary of the Irrawaddy River, consisting of reclaimed paddy fields. A railway runs north-south through this plain. Along both sides of the railway are hills about one hundred meters high. The Mawlu defensive position is located on five hills to the south, covering an area of approximately six hundred meters square. Although the defensive position is not large, the undulating hills form a naturally advantageous fortress.</p>
<p>Initially, on March 5th, a brigade of Major General Wingate's airborne troops (who has since died in battle) landed near the village of Nalongbe, thirty kilometers southeast of Katha, and advanced north. Their main force infiltrated these hills, constructed a defensive position, arriving around March 10th. By the second day, they had completed the firing positions. By the third day, they were digging connecting trenches. Within days, the defensive position was completed.</p>
<p>The construction materials included hardwood timber harvested from the area, railway tracks collected from nearby, and sandbags transported by air. From the mountain peaks to the mountainside, everything was covered with concealed trenches, mortar emplacements, foxholes, and machine-gun pillboxes, as dense as a honeycomb. Furthermore, barbed wire encircled the hillside, and landmines were scattered everywhere, hence the name "Honeycomb Stronghold."</p>
<p>Breaking Through a Corner of the Stronghold</p>
<p>The first attack was on March 20th. By April 6th, reinforcement units were ready, and an offensive was launched from the east of the enemy defensive position. The attacks were all night raids by assault teams. When someone approached the enemy's barbed wire, mortars and machine guns would spew fire from the mountaintop, forming a blanket of fire. Our army, adhering to the battle doctrine of "victory in every battle, conquest in every attack," advanced wave after wave, breaking through a corner of the high-ground defensive position in one fell swoop. However, air superiority was in the enemy's hands. At daybreak, enemy bomber groups appeared, and in an instant, bombs rained down nearby. A few hours later, fabric air-recognition panels formed a white line between the two forces, less than two hundred meters apart, to distinguish friendly and enemy positions.</p>
<p>Supplies were entirely dependent on air transport. Soldiers were also transported by transport aircraft. Every night, groups of transport aircraft with tail lights lit circled over the enemy's airspace. At three locations within the enemy defensive position, signal rockets were launched. The aircraft, within the center of the triangle, dropped objects with countless parachutes. Aircraft with red wing lights carried food, those with blue carried weapons and ammunition, and those with yellow carried medical supplies. Each aircraft dropped enough supplies for three hundred people for one day.</p>
<p>Main Force Retreats</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, the mobilized units attempted to encircle the enemy defensive position, maneuvering from behind towards the northern high ground. From there, an airfield runway of about five hundred meters was clearly visible, less than fifty meters west of the enemy position. We advanced north from the village of Shi Hai in the south of Mawlu, and in less than ten kilometers, this airfield was already the fourth one. Although called an airfield, it was actually just a hastily constructed runway. In one corner of the airfield, anti-aircraft machine guns were deployed.</p>
<p>After constructing the airfield, the airborne troops immediately built a defensive position beside it, deploying outer units around the perimeter to guard against sneak attacks. The defensive position, the airfield, and the transport aircraft formed an airtight, organic entity integrating air and land.</p>
<p>Our enemies were not only in the defensive positions in front but also guerrillas disrupting us from behind from time to time. For two weeks, day and night, fierce battles were fought at the Mawlu front. After April 20th, we used part of our forces to hold the enemy in front, while the main force had to begin retreating to the rear. A characteristic of airborne troops is that they are often threatened by enemy guerrilla attacks from the rear. Recently, the thirty-kilometer-long supply route behind us, between Mawlu and Indaw, was on the verge of crisis due to the infiltration of enemy airborne troops. The enemy, led by a company commanded by British and American officers, dispersed to various locations, built airfields, waited for supplies to be dropped from the air, and launched guerrilla warfare to disrupt the rear.</p>
<p>Gurkha soldiers and Kachin troops, who had received special training in jungle warfare, hid in the dense forests unique to Northern Burma, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Equipped with hand grenades and automatic rifles, they launched swift guerrilla attacks. They planted landmines on the roads to destroy our cargo trucks and then fired with mortars.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Total Collapse</p>
<p>But the land was ultimately the stage for our army's valiant fighting. After the retreat, the airborne troops in this area were reduced within two weeks. Our army units, having completed the mopping-up operation, returned to the Mawlu defensive position in early May, preparing for a general attack. The enemy's will to fight, having lost their forward outposts, visibly declined. On May 11th, the night before the general attack was launched, enemy aircraft with searchlights on their noses came to bomb and strafe our positions at night. The Gurkha soldiers coming from the land mobilized together, and exposed that night's general retreat. At daybreak, time bombs exploded in succession. The entire defensive position became like a ghost town, turning into a sea of smoke. American and Kachin transport aircraft fled. The Gurkha soldiers and Kachin troops fled further north. The enemy, having lost their lair at Mawlu, was on the verge of total collapse. The enemy stronghold northwest of Mawlu, Namikkalaat, was deserted. Another part of our forces struck and decimated the enemy who had fled to the Namikuin position to the north, while the remaining enemy units fled towards Mogaung and Myitkyina. The enemy's dream of retaking Burma vanished like a bubble, and we opened up a major road for supplying the front lines.</p>
<p>The weakness of the enemy airborne troops lies in the moment of landing. Without ground mobility, airborne troops fear the restrictions on aerial resupply and the sense of isolation. After the initial landing, the first things to do are to conduct indoctrination of the local residents, establish an airfield, and construct defensive positions. Then, aerial resupply is used to gradually strengthen combat power. Therefore, the best hope is to shoot them down as soon as they land. (Translated from the Yomiuri Shimbun, October 11th)</p>
<h3>Echoing Japan: Germany's 100 Million People Rise Up in Unison</h3>
<p>During the final stages of the last World War, shortly before Germany proposed a ceasefire, its defense lines were far to the east in Courland and Estonia, and to the west within Belgium and France. Furthermore, the Balkans were under the control of allied Austria-Hungary. In addition, Bulgaria and Turkey were also Germany's allies. Recalling this situation, one can understand how tragic was the situation of Germany, which insisted on fighting with its own country as a "fortress" in this war.</p>
<p>According to the Treaty of Versailles, the area of mainland Germany was 468,850 square kilometers. However, since the recovery of the Saar region in 1935, due to the annexation of Austria and the collapse of Czechoslovakia, Germany became a large country with an area of 636,000 square kilometers and a population of 87 million. After the start of the war against England in 1939, in the ever-expanding German-occupied territories…</p>
<p>After annexing the Polish Corridor, etc., Yugoslavia betrayed Germany at the end of March 1941 and collapsed soon after. When the State of Croatia was born on April 10 of the following month, Germany signed a treaty with it, annexing Carinthia, northern Carniola, and Lower Styria (population of one million). Thus, the territory of mainland Germany can be considered to have a total area of 860,000 square kilometers, with a population of 110 million, one-quarter larger in area than Japan and one-tenth larger in population. However, the General Governorate of Poland (population of ten million) and the western border regions (population of 2.3 million) have been invaded by enemy forces. Therefore, the number of German citizens who can thoroughly mobilize and determine the fate of Europe is now also one hundred million, which is very coincidental with the slogan of allied Japan, "One Hundred Million Rise Up in Unison"! (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, October 7th)</p>

<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Jin Yuming</p>
<p>"Don't talk about tuberculosis in the village, it's a rich man's disease that money can't buy!"</p>
<p>The "Old Gun" on bed number five mockingly said, finding malicious joy in the misfortune. The two words "tuberculosis" truly vexed him, "pricking his ears and startling his heart"!</p>
<p>"Precious disease? God is partial, afflicting this poor boy with this half-dead, half-alive tuberculosis. Death, damn it, hurry up!"</p>
<p>The skinny villager still couldn't change his "heroic spirit" from his younger days. He hated that "Death" didn't arrive swiftly, why it liked to take detours.</p>
<p>"Death, I'm afraid it's not that convenient. We haven't suffered enough for the sins of the living. This is called chronic suicide!"</p>
<p>"Chronic suicide"? The villager was stunned. He didn't understand this "new term." He was indeed not as good at talking as the "Fake Villager."</p>
<p>"That is, the more you want to die early, the less Yama will issue the order, waiting for your blood to dry, your flesh to waste away, before asking you to close your eyelids."</p>
<p>The more he spoke, the worse it got, causing all the patients in the room to sit up straight, furrowing their brows, pressing their weak chests with their hands. Phlegm burst out from their coughs with great difficulty. Everyone seemed to have their life sentence pronounced.</p>
<p>"According to you, are we all destined to die from our illness? Are the needles and medicine just to deceive people?" The youngest boy, with a look of despair, asked the "Fake Villager," his eyes searching for hope.</p>
<p>"Fool, a machine is missing a screw, how can a person's lungs not rot? Germs gnawing every day, one hole here, one hole there, how can you still live!" Without any reservation, he struck the boy with a club, shattering even his dim dream.</p>
<p>"Little brother, don't believe him, you're not like us. At your age, I was walking the docks, a time of being a hero. If I hadn't married a shrew, or had children, who would be hoarding coal ash in that cellar in Shanghai all day... Cough, ten years, eight years, rain or shine, day and night, damn it, just a machine..."</p>
<p>A bout of violent coughing interrupted his painful account, leaning on the bed pillow, stroking his chest. It was as if he wanted to think something out from his words.</p>
<p>"After all the words, aren't you just like me, suffering from a 'disease of life'? Now, if anyone had a hundred thousand or eight hundred thousand, there would be no worries about illness."</p>
<p>"That's right, if I were rich, I wouldn't get tuberculosis. Those in wealthy families, how could they get this kind of disease!"</p>
<p>The villager of the past hated money the most. He only knew how to exchange labor for food. Now, as a prisoner of "disease," he unexpectedly submitted to the power of money.</p>
<p>"Everyone keeps talking about money and illness, just lie down and rest, don't talk nonsense, it wastes energy!" The poor teacher, who had been lying down and listening attentively, advised them out of goodwill.</p>
<p>In truth, they were all a group of poor sufferers, sympathizing with each other's plight. Their lives over the years had been drained of their sweat and blood, breathing in an environment of being exploited and ravaged. Sorrow, depression, and pain were in their days, without a single day of interruption. Laboring, ailing, they could never find joy on their faces, like a gloomy old house, with a stone forever weighing on their hearts. Some were stimulated, troubled by other worries, but they were all too cowardly to vent their emotions, suppressing all the suffering in their small, sorrowful gourd. Gradually, their respiratory tracts became a little short of breath, their lung medicine, in place of the sadness in their hearts, engraved dim spots. Time was the carving tool, line by line, piece by piece, working as the craftsman ending their lives. Some, more beautifully, added color, the bright red spurting from their mouths, as if reporting to their masters, "I have completed what stage!"</p>
<p>This hospital has saved many common people's lives. The hospital always accepts those unable to afford treatment, within the proper procedures. Medicine, board, and lodging, for decades, warm-hearted philanthropists have expended no small amount of effort. Regrettably, with the cost of living soaring today, the hospital's finances are also like suffering from anemia, finding it difficult to raise funds.</p>
<p>The sunset glow scattered brilliantly in the sky, but no one in the room had the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature. Their hearts were fantasizing about the dark, silent, deadly void following the dusk.</p>
<p>The humidity recording chart hanging on the bed frame, from this end to that, was like a series of high peaks of the Himalayas, rarely staying on the horizontal line. The Coasuleu needle still couldn't stop the blood filling their mouths. Their weight, like a cargo truck unloading, gradually decreased. — Undoubtedly, they were being devoured by the bloodthirsty jaws of disease.</p>
<p>Terror followed closely at night; stretching, expanding. On the bed near the boy, lay a body "about to die," its face like a piece of gray-white lacquer cloth, its chest cavity as if there were a bucket of hydrated lime dissolved in water, boiling and churning—but he did not moan, he only had short breaths in his throat, clinging to the last thread of life. He had no last words. A guest in a foreign land, he only vaguely revealed a final smile towards that black sky.</p>
<p>The wind rustled the leaves, playing an inexplicable sorrow. The room was like a terrifying forest; each person's heart was like a frightened bird shot by a hunter, trembling with fear.</p>
<p>The boy watched with wide eyes as the white-clothed people moved in the dim light, covering the person's face with a white cloth, isolating his soul, freeing him from pain, bidding farewell to his companions, roaming in another world.</p>
<p>The morning sun still shone peacefully on that empty bed. The patients cast inexplicable glances from time to time, especially in the boy's heart, with a fearful and heavy matter lying across it; he began to doubt himself, having an indelible impression of this empty bed. Only the "misanthropic" villager was wishing the dead happiness; he felt that life had no meaning to covet. He couldn't bear to witness his wife and children performing that tragic drama for him. He pleaded with the god of death to bury his soul early, to gain a homecoming. That day, there was no family member coming to mourn the dead, and he was finally transported away by the Pushen Cemetery.</p>
<p>After a short silence, the sound of conversation rose again in this ward. They seemed to be talking about the fate of the poor, whose experiences were truly inhumane. The hardships of life were enough for them to endure for a lifetime, why add the torment of illness; and choosing such a difficult-to-cure disease. This was no different from placing them in a death trap, and the creator actually arranged such a cruel ending for them.</p>
<p>The director, doctors, and nurses all walked in from other wards. The patients all lay down calmly. They regarded this as their only savior. The hospital never asked them for a penny for needles, medicine, or board and lodging. They felt immense gratitude, which not only saved them but also indirectly saved their wives and children—.</p>
<p>But that was not the case. Good times don't last long. Today, the director's words, filled with compassion and yet powerless to help, pierced everyone's hearts, their faces pale, everyone mumbling as if in a dream:</p>
<p>"Half a month later—"</p>
<p>They really couldn't believe it. This was a nightmare.</p>
<p>Leaving the hospital, what difference was there between that and leaving this world?</p>
<h3>Review of "The Power of Darkness" at Yi's Arts Company</h3>
<p>— Fengying</p>
<p>… "The Power of Darkness" was originally written by the Russian Tolstoy, and this time the Chinese Arts Theater Troupe is staging it based on Ouyang Yuqian's Chinese adaptation. I have not read the original, so there is no way to make a comparison. And the feeling that the Chinese Arts Theatre's "The Power of Darkness" gave me is this…—</p>
<p>… People in the world are so foolish and unprogressive! The characters in the play must have been people from decades ago, but they are still almost the same as people today. I mean: most people today are still not much better than them and have not made any progress, on the contrary, the latter are still not as innocent and honest as the former in the play. They are jealous, greedy, and lack reason; their actions and behavior are so disorganized. Beforehand, no one knows that what they are doing is "impossible to live," and only at the end, when things have progressed to the point of being irredeemable, do they know their sins and discover the existence of conscience. Even some people, even at the point of death, do not know their weaknesses and mistakes, ignorantly sowing the seeds of pain in the world. People in the world are so foolish and unprogressive! In the end, they cannot overcome the demon of desire, and they can never escape the palm of the demon of desire.</p>
<p>… Director Fang Xin is a hardworking scholar who has translated several Russian works, such as "The Government Inspector" being one of them. Although the translations are mostly translated from Japanese, rather than directly from Russian, Fang Xin has considerable knowledge and research on Russian literature. Directing plays derived from Russian is like a familiar road for him. Take "Thunderstorm," which he directed for the Chinese Youth Theater two years ago, didn't it have good results and win people's hearts? It's just that the actors under Fang Xin's direction must have considerable artistic ideas and understanding. Look at the Chinese Art students who appear in "The Power of Darkness": all those who are clever can display their acting skills on stage and match the identity of the person in the play; those who are more honest are inevitably stiff and ridiculous on stage and give people a feeling of puppets. It can be seen that Fang Xin can indeed encourage actors, let actors be free, and give actors considerable status, but he cannot inspire actors like Director Wu Renzhi, help them carefully create the artistic conception and personality of the characters in the play. Most actors are impetuous and unstable. However, being able to painstakingly rehearse some novice actors to such an achievement, and present "The Power of Darkness" in front of people, the director's contribution cannot be denied.</p>
<p>… Inaccurate pronunciation and enunciation are the biggest problems for all the actors on stage. They put little effort into the dialogue and reading.</p>
<p>… Hua Ling, who played Hua Yueying, had a very flat tone. She couldn't cry when she should have cried; and she didn't dare to laugh heartily when she should have laughed. She had many opportunities to appear and speak in the whole play, which damaged some of the achievements that should have been possible. Only in the scene where she forced her husband, Li Qi, to bury the baby, she was resolute and shrewish, seemingly hating and angry, and performed very wonderfully. Qian Hui, who played Li Hongshi, had more sharpness than cleverness, probably because her body shook too much and she squinted her eyes too much. A scheming old woman with a narrow mind should not be so lively and frivolous. Le Tian and Qing Xiang, who played Zhang Yufu, Xiao Yin, and the neighbor girl, etc., were also okay. Wu Gai, who played the eldest daughter Xiao Jin, was lively and commendable, but she was very willful and casual. Fortunately, the actor's own habitual movements happened to be in line with the identity of the character in the play, so it actually seemed natural. And the best actors in the performance were Yun Ye, who played Li Qi, and Sha Yi, who played Wang Xiuying. Every gesture and every step can be said to be impeccable, and the voice is clear and crisp, with proper intonation.</p>
<p>… The lighting, makeup, and costumes can also be said to be without flaws. As for the equipment and scenery, I personally think that the furnishings and scenery in one scene of Li Qi's home should not be so clean and tidy! Because even the most careless theatergoer will think: how can the walls and stoves in the thatched cottage of a rural farmer be so spotless?</p>
<p>… It seems that I shouldn't say so much to the young and hardworking Chinese Arts Troupe, which is a bit like nitpicking. However, for these actors and theater workers who are learning, simply praising them is not only useless but also harmful. I hope they can continue to learn and continue to experiment. With this enthusiasm and belief in staging "The Power of Darkness," they will continue to work hard, and the future is limitless! The writer would like to send his earnest hope. This article can also be regarded as a prelude to expecting better results to appear on the stage! (October 28, 1944)</p>

<h3>Midpoint Assessment of the Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament: Analyzing the Strengths of the Top Three Teams</h3>
<p>— (Mei Bixian)</p>
<p>Hualian and Shantou Teams Both Have Championship Hopes; Zhongbei Still in Contention</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League is already halfway through its competition. As a general rule, the strong have prevailed and the weak have been defeated. Currently, the only teams maintaining a winning record are Hualian and Shantou. Zhongbei is the only team with one loss that still has a good chance. The remaining teams have suffered two or more defeats, so it can be said that only these three teams are vying for the championship. Here is a table of recent standings:</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that there were no upsets last week, here is an analysis of the three promising strong teams:</p>
<p>Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory Has the Highest Hopes</p>
<p>Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory was the champion team of the last Western Youth tournament. Even after winning that championship, the team continued to practice actively without interruption. The excellence of their spirit is unmatched by other teams. Because of this, their basketball skills have been improving day by day. They have won all five matches in the Shen Bao Cup, and their winning scores have generally been quite high, so their success is certainly not accidental. Assessing their strength, the first thing is their proficiency, and the second is that each player is able to know themselves and their opponents, with few flaws. In terms of tactics, Hualian can deploy various methods. The main point is that they can attack the weaknesses of others and use their own strengths. What is particularly commendable is that all five players on the starting lineup have the ability to shoot baskets. Their weakness seems to be that the two guards are too carefree, and their speed is slightly insufficient. Also, when breaking the opponent's five-man zone defense, their use of screens is not yet fully proficient. The starting lineup will definitely be this one:</p>
<p>Zhang Liangxiong, Qu Xilin</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang</p>
<p>Fan Qinggong, Kong Guangyi</p>
<p>Talking about the recent condition of these five tigers, Wu Chengzhang is generally considered to have made the most significant progress. His rebounding under the basket relies on his jumping ability, as well as his accurate timing and positioning, succeeding seven or eight times out of ten, which is commendable. Zhang Liangxiong's special feature is his ability to make surprise shots and his skill in defense. However, it is a pity that he occasionally makes mistakes. Fan Qinggong's dribbling and shooting techniques have regained their former glory from his time in Beiping. This player still seems to have more theory than practice, and he inevitably has shortcomings where he can talk the talk but can't walk the walk, probably still on the path to mastering his craft. Qu Xilin has moments of ease and fancy moves, and his fundamentals are also excellent, truly a veteran of the team. Although Uncle Kong is old, his recent energy in dribbling is vigorous. Who says Uncle Kong is old? His shooting skills are even more divine, and he is still an important main player.</p>
<p>The Young Players of the Shantou Team Are a Force to Be Reckoned With</p>
<p>After Shantou defeated Zhongbei, the basketball scene was shocked. In fact, Lin Zuoshi, the leader of the Shantou team, has indeed put in a lot of hard work and effort, which is by no means accidental. These young players are a force to be reckoned with. In the subsequent matches, Hualian is their only enemy, and they have great hope for the championship. Because their players are young, their performance is fast-paced. All three forwards are small but skilled, like lively dragons and tigers. In summary, their offense is based on speed and coordinated teamwork. Their accurate shooting is quite successful. When examining their defense, it is still somewhat lacking in solidity. Each player's position is not yet ideal. Their lineup is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Weiting, Zhou Bin</p>
<p>Ji Nankang</p>
<p>Chen Qingjiang, Ma Canxi</p>
<p>Among them, the experienced Ma Canxi is the soul of both offense and defense, while Chen Qingjiang is a new player who excels at making breakthroughs and disrupting the defense. Lin Weiting is indeed the key to scoring, but he has two shortcomings: first, his shooting is inconsistent and cannot be relied upon. Second, if the defender knows his playing style, it is very easy to shut him down, making it difficult for him to find a way out. Ji Nankang is the least experienced player on the team, but Little Ji's steady style is not inferior to that of veteran players. He is a promising young player. Zhou Bin is more courageous than clever in his defense, so he is often seen charging recklessly and getting hurt.</p>
<p>Although Zhongbei Lost, They Still Have a Chance</p>
<p>Although Zhongbei lost to Shantou, they still have a chance. If Hualian wins against Shantou, the final match will be between Zhongbei and Hualian. If they can win at that time, they will form a single round-robin tie. Looking back at Zhongbei's performance, each player's basketball skills are indeed excellent, and their unique style has been very popular with fans. Because of this, the players have practiced relatively little, and they are at a disadvantage in terms of teamwork. At the beginning of the season, they also made the mistakes of inexperience. As a result, not only was their performance not ideal, but they also seemed to lack direction in their adjustments. In general, the Northern style is a style of individualism, where each player displays their unique skills. According to their performance in the second half of the match against the All-Stars, their ideal lineup should be:</p>
<p>Zhen Zhong relies on his talent. The beauty of his movements lingers in the minds of fans. He is worthy of being a national player. However, recently, he seems to lack strength. It is said that this is because he has not fully recovered from his illness. Xue Chong seems to lack the commanding presence of his younger years. It is now rare to see his signature move of taking a large step and laying the ball in under the basket. What is commendable is his consistency in securing the ball. His ability to avoid defenders and shoot under the basket is still incredibly skillful. Yu Gong is good at attacking but less good at defending, which is his consistent style. His left-handed, leaping, bent-back shot is a strange shot that opponents cannot stop. In the past, he had a record of making every shot, but this season, he has suddenly been plagued by bad luck, making only one out of ten shots. Could it be that his luck is bad this year? If this shot can be successfully recovered, Yu Gong's reputation will still be great. Guorong has the spirit and experience, and his style is similar to that of the Northern school, so in the Zhongbei team, it is difficult to tell that he is a new member this year. Binzhong is extremely agile, but I feel that he is often penalized for inexplicable fouls, which is a pity because it reduces his power. Baozhong is not afraid of fierceness, but rather of cleverness and cunning. In short, he is a top-notch player in the competition.</p>
<p>According to the schedule, the strong teams Hualian and Shantou will first meet on the 15th of this month, and the final match in Group A will be between Hualian and Zhongbei (on the 27th). All three teams are conserving their strength and preparing for their encounters. Outside of these encounters, the basketball arena will definitely host unprecedented excitement.</p>
<h3>Essential Basketball Theory (3)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>2. Basic Individual Offensive Skills</p>
<p>To improve the standard of basketball, one must work hard on the basic individual offensive skills. If the basic movements are not proficient, then the team's cooperation and offensive strategy are not worth discussing. Although there are many basketball teams in Shanghai, most of them do not have good guidance or training. Therefore, the competition lacks strategy, and the basic individual offensive skills are also very immature. Players often commit the faults of being greedy for high achievements and being impatient. They are not willing to pay attention to practicing basic movements, nor are they interested in them. It is common to see players who have been through hundreds of battles, but their shooting technique is only one out of ten. When running, their heels touch the ground first; when passing, the ball is either too high or too low; the force is either too strong or too weak; they do not hold the ball in their abdomen for protection, and they do not know how to use "rotation" to avoid the enemy. They even panic and do not know what to do, resulting in the team's hard-earned ball being taken back by the opponent due to this kind of individual technical error, affecting the team's offensive opportunity. All of this is due to a lack of training in basic individual skills. In fact, basketball, like other academic subjects, requires strict training, patient research, and constant practice to master the basic skills. Basic basketball skills include passing, receiving, shooting, dribbling, and rotation. The more important ones are described below:</p>
<p>For any basketball player, the most important condition is to be proficient in holding the ball; otherwise, in a game, the number of balls that they unnecessarily lose is often beyond expectation. If the ball is lost, it not only affects the team's offensive opportunity, but also has the possibility of being snatched by the opponent, and even results in the opponent scoring an extra point. This one point may determine the opponent's final victory, so the seriousness of the situation is evident.</p>
<p>The reasons for losing the ball are generally the following, which must be noted: (1) not watching the ball with both eyes; (2) not spreading the fingers as much as possible when receiving the ball, but often straightening them to face the incoming ball, not forming a bowl shape with both hands downwards or upwards; (3) the wrists and elbows are too stiff when receiving the ball; (4) the incoming ball is passed too high, too low, or too far away from the body.</p>
<p>The closer the passing distance, the more times the ball is lost, because the closer the distance, the faster the speed, and the receiver often looks for a teammate to pass to before the ball is received, instead of watching the ball being received. Therefore, when receiving the ball, both eyes should first watch the ball, and at the same time, use the corner of the eye to look for teammates. The eyes should not leave the incoming ball until the ball is received.</p>
<p>The most appropriate and easy-to-receive ball should be passed to the waist or near the shoulder; too high or too low is not advisable; if it is passed near the head, it will force the receiver to quickly lower their head to avoid it, disrupting their line of sight and causing them to lose the ball. Therefore, the ball should be received between the chest and abdomen, the fingers should be spread upwards or downwards, the elbows should be bent, and the wrists should be soft. When the ball comes, let it touch the palm first, then close the fingers to grip the ball, relax the elbows and shoulders, and have some flexibility with the force of the ball, so that the ball is not easily lost, and at the same time, place the held ball in an easy-to-pass position, which is a perfect way to receive.</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Methods (2) (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, translated by Yide</p>
<p>Stand upright, with the center of gravity of the body evenly distributed on the left and right feet, and hands on the waist. Straighten the chest as much as possible, but the feet must not leave the ground, not even slightly raising the heels. The natural posture of the feet is to have the heels together and the toes apart; now do the opposite, bringing the toes together and slowly moving the heels apart to the left and right, first moving the left foot, then the right foot (or first right, then left). The further the distance, the better, but the toes must still touch, and the body must be straight.</p>
<p>Waist and Back Exercise: Hands on waist; body straight; toes together; heels apart.</p>
<p>Note: You will feel relaxed after only one attempt.</p>
<p>38. Have You Ever Sat on a Wooden Horse?</p>
<p>Have students ever sat on a wooden horse? This is very beneficial. Its special purpose is to make the leg muscles elastic and to lift the feet quickly. If you exercise with your mouth closed, you can also control your breathing and expand your lung capacity. When exercising, you should keep your mouth closed, and even after the exercise is finished, you must keep your mouth closed until your breathing returns to normal.</p>
<p>(Liver Squeeze Exercise) Rotate Left and Right</p>
<h3>Sports Miscellany</h3>
<p>The Phoenix Cup Basketball Tournament, sponsored by Mr. Zheng Peimin of Peicheng Electric Factory, was originally scheduled to hold its closing ceremony at the Huaying Stadium last weekend, but it was postponed due to rain. It is now scheduled to be held at the original venue starting at 2:00 PM today, and the program will remain the same. Admission to the competition is by complimentary ticket, and there are not many left.
