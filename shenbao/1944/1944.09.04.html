<h3 id="c1">讀「我的重慶政權觀」後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>問：吉田先生連日在貴報發表的」我的重慶政權觀中一文，很能引起各方面注意。都覺得日本方面了解中國到如此程度，總是兩國前途之福。不知先生有何見解？</p>
<p>答：吉田先生這篇文章，洋洋萬言，但其中心，還只在如何促進中日問題最妥善的解決，還只在如何真正實現中日兩國在戰時及戰後永遠的協力。這扁文章的根本出發點和結論就在這裏，是不能忽略過去的。</p>
<p>問：關於重慶政權內部南大派系的情形，有何不同的見解？特別是關於「國粹派」云云，其實質是否如吉田先生所言？</p>
<p>答：大體上，吉田先生所說明的，都很正確，據我們所可能了解的，也止於此。不過，我們所應補充的，所謂國粹派，本身是雜湊的，並不真有這樣的一個政派，只是在對日對共的觀點上，彼此相同而已，可是他們中間的利害並不一致，因此，如果說國粹派是一個鞏固的政治集團，從而作為政治工作的對象，固然並無其事；就是認為他們對日對共觀點與對策是一貫堅持的，也不免離開事實。因為他科彼此間矛盾正多，而且海一個實力份子也各有一套投機木領，從來不曾堅持自己主張到底。</p>
<p>問：英美派的實情如何？</p>
<p>答：吉田先生對於英美派的解剖已很切實，在重度政權內，所謂「反共三位一體一的黃浦系，政學系，CC團，表面上似乎並未操縱全權，然而實際上從中央到地方，實權都在他們掌握，除了外交及軍事的一部分主權以外，這三派就可充分代表重慶政權了，（但須注意他們彼此並不統一）。至於所謂英美派，除了外交上，就沒有掌握到重慶政權的實權，但是他們對內，無疑的是所謂買辦資本家利益的代表者，同時仍不失為大部份民族資本家所追隨，在中國現階段的政治活動中，是具有主導作用的，何况又有英美的政治家外交家乃至軍事家為其支持？所國粹派中的政學系等，也不乏個別分子，其政治主張與行動，同時和英美派保持若干聯系。</p>
<p>問：關於蔣介石的估計不是太高了些嗎</p>
<p>答：從不質上說，蔣或許以民族資本家利益的代表著自命，不過更切實的說，則是自己英雄主義與超人權利的堅持者，所以同時還站在封建殘餘勢力方面，為大地主的利益說幾句話。他是永遠不會只跟那一派那一事跑，或只利用一派一系為滿足的。他不僅常常是重慶政權下各派系的最高支配者，甚至對於國粹派與英美派的對立，對於重慶國民黨和共產黨的衝突，對於外交政策上親蘇親英美親帕心的粉岐上，也往往自處於超特的地位，視時勢及時機而變更其態度。如果一定說他具有堅毅和卓越之特性，那就是他這種機會主義的堅持，和這種機會主義的運用而巳。所以，是寺勢造成也的也立，且也今日的地位是否會打破當前的時勢呢？大約他自己也不敢作此夢想吧！至於一般人愛談的蔣未一家關係的演變，我認為沒有多大意義，對政治也起不了什麼大作用的。</p>
<p>問：你的意思，似乎重慶政權內部都給機會主義所支配了？這樣一個機會主義的政權是否會打破現局而維持其存在或實現其理想？</p>
<p>答：老實說，如果機會主義會有付麼成功，世界大戰也不會爆發。如果重慶的機會主談政策可以成功，那麼「抗戰」七年多以來，他們的成功在那裹？軍事上？政治上？經濟上？還是小數個人的「名譽」上？但就不說機會主義吧，自大東亞戰爭以來，兩年八個月間，中國戰塲上的沉靜時期不可謂不長久了，試問重慶在此期間做些什麼？準備些什麼？日軍要洛陽，洛陽隨手而陷；日軍要長沙要衡陽，長沙衡陽也不旋踵而下；將來日軍要桂林要重慶，誰保得作挂休重慶不為長沙衡陽之續？</p>
<p>間：先生以為重慶政權無論作機會主義或實力方面，都是無法打破現狀的了！那麼，所謂妥　的道路，　不免言之過早吧？</p>
<p>答：為了復興中國，建設新東亞，我們首先須求早日實現中國之統一，也就是說早日實現全面的和平。吉田先生在「我的重慶政權觀」一文中，巳經很明晰地指出：這條道路雖然有，但日本方面對於重慶和整個中國人心，必須先有眞實的了解，這是顚樸不破的眞理。但是我在這裹有一點感想，有如骨鞭在喉。不吐不快：第一，就是日本人士方而，也許還有人認為中日間題的　結既在「抗戰」，而「抗戰」是重慶政權特別是蔣介石指導的，因此認為全面和平或中國統一問題，首先注目於重慶政權特別是蔣介石。但誠如吉田先生所指出的，問題的中心並不在此，而只在「民族心理」！所以我希望大眾的自光轉移一下，與其在意重慶政權特別是蔣介石，母寗注意於重慶政權下民眾之爭取；而更切實的說：與其空曾爭取重慶政權下的民眾，不如實實在在的爭取和平區內的民眾·我們始終認定，只要和平區域的民眾對國策和日本的對華政策發生向心的作用，那麼全國不論何處的人民都會裏心歸向。這就是全面和平或全國統一的唯一大道·第二，目前和平區內一般人士，由於不正確的時局觀念，不肯積極努力於各項建設事業，抱着虛幻的等待主義。然而幻想終是幻想，結果徒然自誤誤國。我們直到今天，還是痛切感到和平區內，不論在政治，經濟，社會，乃至文化建設上，橫互着無數的暗礁，在大衆袖手等待觀念之下，是不會有什麼成就的！所以我們懇切希望不論在朝在野，上下一致，積極起來，振作起來，先來解決和平區城內的革新，建設，復興路問題，集中力量來剷除暗礁，克服困難。只要，也只有我們在和平區內這種實踐工作有了成就，那麼，不淪重慶政權的動向如何，就不怕人心不歸趨，就不怕國家不統一，就不怕國家的建設與復興不成功。也就不怕中日的協力不切實不徹底了。這是我細續吉田先生大作後最深刻感覺到的一　。</p>
<h3 id="c2">滿積極推行施策　强化總力戰態勢　張國務總理宣布國政大綱 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>新京三日中央社電滿洲國舉行第十二次協和會全聯協議會，第一日張國務總理實布國政大綱，其要旨如次：大東亞戰爭現巳入東亞興亡之決戰階段，吾滿洲建國十有二載之光輝　設經營，實正今日完　戰勝建設大東亞之先驅而為發揮其眞義者也。現在吾四千三百萬國民應即一致奮起，不達擎滅英美目的　不終止，急速完成總力決戰態勢。為求強化防衛態勢，更應積極推進增強戰力，以求實現天東亞復興之顯望。政府為絕對確保國內洽安，更有強力講求諸般措施之必要。關於防空事宜，微諸過去敵機空襲鞍山之經騐，應加強空襲不足恐怖之確信，官民上下於此尤應澈底強化防空態勢，整備萬全之準備。對於增強戰力，吾滿洲國所負担之最大責任如增產晨產物及輕金屬煤，以及其他軍需品方面，本年度較去年度更為昂揚，政府現亦集中總力，澈底推行施策。關於礦工業方面之增產，因戰局之急迫，應急速集中總力，澈底推行施策，努力求其實現。</p>
<h3 id="c3">北緬甸日軍增援　龍陵西南激戰中　芒市附近日軍奪回兩高地 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據美聯社重慶特派員二日報吿怒江方面之戰況稱，渝軍當局一日夜發表之公報謂，怒江戰織日軍於援軍到達後，即包圍龍陵西南十公里之渝軍陣地，刻正激戰中云云。按渝軍雖曾於龍陵南方及西南方稍向前進展，然已將緬甸公路芒市西北約十一公里之兩高地再度喪失，重慶軍現正使用美國製之火燄敖射器，向怒江渡河點附近松山之日軍特火點進攻中。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據重慶電：渝商務日報北緬從軍記者頃暴露來多公路作戰之內幕，並宣稱漁軍刻對史蒂威爾甚至英軍均抱憤　。其大意謂，依據史蒂威爾當初之作戰計劃，第二蚰所屬之英印第七十七旅，担當對北緬卯加文地方之攻勢。而負責打開卯加文與喀麥因間二十九公里之一段公路者，為第三師所屬之英印第百十一旅及第七十四旅。但第七十七旅未能向卯加文進攻，而前記二旅更被日軍困於高地，英印軍三個旅團毫無成功。現在史蒂成爾竟要求渝新緬第八師担負更多之任務。</p>
<h3 id="c4">敵機襲西里伯　被擊落五架 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>西南太平洋日軍幕地二日中央社電　敵機隊一日以大型機二架，二日上午以戰鬥轟炸機十七架，分別來襲西里伯島美那多地區，純日機隊及日軍理上砲火分頭迎擊，卒被擎落五架。此外敵並曾於一日長以小型機約四十架，來襲新幾內亞西南部之卡伊馬納，並會於一日下午以戰鬥轟炸機十餘架，來襲哈爾馬耶拉島之得爾納特。</p>
<h3 id="c5">美記者報告　湖南戰况 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據美聯社重慶特派員二日報吿，湖南戰況如次：日軍刻變更其對衡陽地區渝軍之壓迫方式，不由北方向湘江進攻，而由距衡陽不及三十公里之處，沒湘桂鐵路西進。日軍之大隊由耒陽進抵該市西南方十八公里之處，更由該處轉向衡陽南方之常寗進攻，刻距該市僅九公里，正與渝軍展開激戰。日軍如佔領常寗，則可與南下部隊協力，以常寗作為向湘桂鐵路進攻之據點，且可集中精力，進剿衡陽西南作戰之渝軍。渝軍當局認為日軍進攻之目標，僅限於此，尚非真正開始大規模之南下作戰。但日軍刻正積極向衡陽附近輸送給養，暗示現在之進攻，工者將發展為攻向桂林之攻勢，果然成為事實，當又有不少影響也。又渝軍當局，一日部宣稱永豐東方發生戰鬥，並確認浙省空軍基地與水已行失陷云</p>
<h3 id="c6">李雨霖將軍　告渝將士書 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　李雨霖中將，一日發表吿重慶方面武裝團體書。大意謂抗戰陳營同胞，應明瞭全面和平之時機已熟，披　和建信念，共同建設大東亞。</p>
<h3 id="c7">桂林現狀　混亂不堪 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　自衡陽陷落後，桂林即日趨動搖，三十日渝方廣播亦承認，日軍勢必來攻，於是挂林益陷於極度混亂狀態。茲據渝方度播桂林之現狀如次：挂林為防備。軍從衡陽採取新行動，刻正採取萬全之防禦能勢，市民殆全部編成義勇隊，同時「傷兵看護圈」亦吿編成，此外並急行設備軍需品及軍用倉庫。從九月一日起，全市所有車輛己悉被徽用，廣西省政府亦會積極着手限制市內食糧之移出。另一方面由於日軍之進攻衡陽，一般高人或一般居民，均曾來比避難，致使商業狀况益陷混亂，而藉戰爭以圖利之奸商，更猖獗跳梁不可收拾。</p>
<h3 id="c8">香港設立　交蜴公社 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>香港三日中央社電　香港日本總督部為充實革需民需食資，促進戰時生產活動，特廢止香港貿易公會，而于一日設立香港交易公社，從事交易物資之全　工作。該交易公社構成分子，經指定為當地之十入家有力公司，資本共計一千入百萬元，依照總督命令，辦理下列各利業務：　軍需物資之收買運輸和保管，　協力樹立一般物資運輸保管配給之計劃，　　　輸出入各項物資之價格？</p>
<h3 id="c9">八十五届日議會　定六日召集　首相將發表施政演說 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電　日木小磯內閣因鑒於戰局日漸進入決戰階段，前會決定於本月六日召開第八十五次臨時議會。召開之目的，不外為使國民澈底明瞭小礦丙閣之重要施政方針，期官民一體上下團結，完遂戰爭。議會討論之提案，為追加臨時軍事費預算案及關於農業增驚之一般會計預算案等，預料法律案件將不予討論。木次談會之最值注目者，為七日下午四時會議中，小磯首相之施政方針演說，及陸海兩大臣之戰況報吿。至於重光外務大臣關於外交之演說則或將中止，但對預算總會質問之解答，次現時下國際政局，外相將披瀝其所信</p>
<p>（中央社滬訊）渝方此次拉權前「新疆省主席」盛藝考　出任農﹝部長，美聯社華盛頓電報以及紐約時報消息，咸認此舉為渝方對蘇獻媚之一種，或謂此係一九二七年蔣介石政權建立以來調動省主席之最重要者。但渝行政院參事張平羣稱：此僅係內政止之調動，並舉張　出任四川省，吳　昌出任貴州省等前例，力加辦論。然盛世才以歷時十餘年建築之邊境地盤，以及四萬人之部屬移歸渝方支配，以佔農林部長之一席地位，其意義並非僅在定期調動而己。</p>
<p>據渝可靠方面意見，渝方為加强新疆之發言權興地步，當然應摒除親蘇派之盛世才，惟一九四二年以來彼對於渝方開發西北工作出力亦不小，尤以去年底渝方與外蒙軍發生衝突事件以還，英美等所感憤　者，不在重慶之向新疆襲展，而痛恨新疆向重慶進展。</p>
<p>此次盛世才之調動，美國亦予特別重視，其所以臺此者，亦可見彼等已深知蘇聯欲牽制美國之危險，美國前曾派華萊士赴渝，今又　派約爾遜訪渝，似同出一轍，此可認為美國援渝之誠意乎。</p>
<p>據聞美國之物資動員已達最高限度，然彼對渝方之竭力拉攏結果，其目的亦在露出企開開發西北之野心，賢明之渝當避，不致不洞察其奸！</p>
<h3 id="c10">渝更調盛世才　英美野心益露 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>美方自特派華萊士訪淪以來，即宣傳渝蘇間關係即吿好轉，此若認為是華萊士謀在淪蘇間從中幹旋，毋寗謂此因華萊士之訪渝及美國之野心而有如此宣傳，渝方至此立塲，左右為難，盛世才亦以僅完成了傀儡的任務，感到非常悲傷。但盛世才並不應痛限渝方之立塲，蓋渝方捨此別無他途，因此使盛　脫新疆是為美國侵略野心之一時的勝利，其次納爾　之訪渝，淪方更不得不以賢明的措置過止其侵略。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　紐約郵報於一日就淪府罷免新疆省主應處世才事論稱，盛世才被罷免事件，己遠離美國所懷抱之將來此界和平關心。然據軍慶電報，可知盛世才之被強制　職，乃在改善蘇聯與重慶關係，此次盛氏辭職，他日渝蘇關係更將親善，此或即係將來遠東之最大事件。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After Reading "My View of the Chongqing Regime" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Question: Mr. Yoshida's article "My View of the Chongqing Regime," published in your newspaper for several days, has attracted much attention from various parties. Everyone feels that Japan's understanding of China to this extent is a blessing for the future of both countries. I wonder what your opinion is on this?</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Yoshida's article is voluminous, running to tens of thousands of words, but its central theme is still how to promote the most appropriate resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem, and how to truly realize the lasting cooperation between China and Japan during and after the war. The fundamental starting point and conclusion of this article lie here, and cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Question: What different views do you have regarding the situation of the Southern University faction within the Chongqing regime? In particular, concerning the "National Essence Faction," is its essence as Mr. Yoshida described?</p>
<p>Answer: Generally speaking, Mr. Yoshida's description is quite accurate, and our understanding is limited to this as well. However, what we should add is that the so-called National Essence Faction is itself a mixed bag. There isn't really such a political faction, they only share similar views on Japan and the Communists. However, their interests are not consistent. Therefore, while it is not true to consider the National Essence Faction as a solid political group and thus treat it as an object of political work, it is also inaccurate to think that their views and strategies towards Japan and the Communists are consistently upheld. Because there are many contradictions among them, and each influential figure has their own set of speculative tricks, they have never insisted on their own claims to the end.</p>
<p>Question: What is the real situation of the Anglo-American faction?</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Yoshida's analysis of the Anglo-American faction is very incisive. Within the Chongqing regime, the so-called "anti-communist trinity" of the Whampoa clique, the political science clique, and the CC clique, may not seem to control all power on the surface, but in reality, they control real power from the central to local levels. Except for diplomacy and a portion of military sovereignty, these three factions can fully represent the Chongqing regime (but it should be noted that they are not unified among themselves). As for the so-called Anglo-American faction, they have not grasped the real power of the Chongqing regime except in diplomacy. However, internally, they are undoubtedly the representatives of the interests of the comprador capitalists, while also being followed by most of the national capitalists. In the current stage of political activities in China, they play a leading role, especially with the support of British and American politicians, diplomats, and even military leaders. Therefore, among the National Essence Faction, there are also individual members, whose political views and actions maintain some connection with the Anglo-American faction at the same time.</p>
<p>Question: Isn't the assessment of Chiang Kai-shek a bit too high?</p>
<p>Answer: Essentially, Chiang may regard himself as the representative of the interests of the national capitalists, but more realistically, he is a proponent of his own heroism and superhuman rights. Therefore, he also stands on the side of the feudal remnants, saying a few words for the interests of the large landowners. He will never just follow one faction or one thing, or only use one faction to satisfy himself. He is not only often the supreme controller of the various factions under the Chongqing regime, but also often places himself in a detached position regarding the opposition between the National Essence Faction and the Anglo-American Faction, the conflict between the Chongqing Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the divergence of foreign policy on being pro-Soviet, pro-British-American, or pro-Europe, changing his attitude according to the situation and timing. If we must say that he has the characteristics of perseverance and excellence, it is his insistence on this opportunism and the application of this opportunism. Therefore, his status is shaped by the times. And will today's status be broken by the current situation? He probably wouldn't dare to dream of that! As for the evolution of the Chiang family's relationship that people love to talk about, I don't think it has much significance and doesn't play a big role in politics.</p>
<p>Question: Your meaning seems to be that the internal affairs of the Chongqing regime are dominated by opportunism? Can such an opportunistic regime break the current situation and maintain its existence or realize its ideals?</p>
<p>Answer: Frankly speaking, if opportunism were to succeed, the World War would not have broken out. If Chongqing's opportunistic policies could succeed, then where has their success been in the more than seven years of the "War of Resistance"? In military affairs? In politics? In economics? Or in the "reputation" of a few individuals? Let alone opportunism, since the Greater East Asia War, the period of quiet on the Chinese battlefield for two years and eight months has been quite long. May I ask what Chongqing has done during this period? What preparations have they made? When the Japanese army wanted Luoyang, Luoyang fell easily; when the Japanese army wanted Changsha and Hengyang, Changsha and Hengyang fell soon after. In the future, if the Japanese army wants Guilin and Chongqing, who can guarantee that Guilin and Chongqing will not be a sequel to Changsha and Hengyang?</p>
<p>Question: Mr. believes that the Chongqing regime, whether in terms of opportunism or strength, is unable to break the status quo! Then, isn't it too early to talk about the so-called appropriate path to peace?</p>
<p>Answer: In order to revive China and build a new East Asia, we must first seek the early realization of China's unification, that is, the early realization of overall peace. Mr. Yoshida has already clearly pointed out in his article "My View of the Chongqing Regime": although this path exists, the Japanese side must first have a true understanding of Chongqing and the entire Chinese people. This is an unbreakable truth. But I have a feeling here, like a bone spur in my throat. I must speak it out: First, it is that some Japanese people may still think that the knot of the Sino-Japanese problem lies in the "War of Resistance," and that the "War of Resistance" is directed by the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, they believe that the issue of overall peace or Chinese unification should first focus on the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek. But as Mr. Yoshida pointed out, the center of the problem is not here, but only in the "national psychology"! Therefore, I hope that everyone's attention will shift, and rather than focusing on the Chongqing regime, especially Chiang Kai-shek, it is better to focus on winning over the people under the Chongqing regime; and more realistically speaking: rather than winning over the people under the Chongqing regime in vain, it is better to realistically win over the people in the peace zone. We have always believed that as long as the people in the peace zone have a centripetal effect on the national policy and Japan's policy towards China, then the people all over the country will sincerely return. This is the only great road to overall peace or national unification. Second, at present, the general people in the peace zone are unwilling to actively work hard on various construction undertakings due to incorrect views on the current situation, and hold a vain wait-and-see attitude. However, illusions are ultimately illusions, and the result is only self-deception and harm to the country. Even today, we still feel acutely that there are countless hidden reefs in the political, economic, social, and even cultural construction in the peace zone, and there will be no achievements under the public's wait-and-see attitude! Therefore, we sincerely hope that regardless of whether they are in or out of office, or high or low, they will actively rise up, cheer up, and first solve the problems of innovation, construction, and revival in the peace zone, and concentrate their efforts to eliminate hidden reefs and overcome difficulties. As long as, and only if, our practical work in the peace zone is successful, then no matter what the trend of the Chongqing regime is, we will not be afraid that the people's hearts will not converge, we will not be afraid that the country will not be unified, and we will not be afraid that the country's construction and revival will not be successful. Nor will we fear that the cooperation between China and Japan will not be practical and thorough. This is the most profound feeling I have after reading Mr. Yoshida's great work.</p>

On the first day, Prime Minister Zhang announced the outline of national policies, the main points of which are as follows: The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage for the rise and fall of East Asia. The glorious construction and management of our Manchuria over the past twelve years is precisely the pioneer in winning the war and building Greater East Asia today and manifesting its true meaning. Now, our 43 million people should rise up in unison and not end until the goal of destroying Britain and the United States is achieved, and rapidly complete the total war decisive battle posture. In order to strengthen the defense posture, we should also actively promote the enhancement of combat power in order to realize the obvious hope of the restoration of East Asia. The government believes that it is necessary to vigorously seek all kinds of measures to absolutely ensure domestic security. Regarding air defense matters, based on past experience of enemy air raids on Anshan, we should strengthen the conviction that air raids are not terrible, and officials and civilians should thoroughly strengthen the air defense posture and prepare thoroughly. Regarding the enhancement of combat power, the greatest responsibility borne by our Manchukuo, such as increasing the production of morning products, light metals, coal, and other military supplies, is more buoyant this year than last year. The government is now concentrating its total efforts to thoroughly implement policies. Regarding the increase in production in the mining and industrial sectors, due to the urgency of the war situation, we should rapidly concentrate our total efforts, thoroughly implement policies, and strive to achieve it.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army Reinforcements in Northern Burma, Fierce Fighting Southwest of Longling, Japanese Army Recaptures Two Heights Near Mangshi <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 2nd, regarding the war situation on the Nu River front, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the night of the 1st that after the arrival of reinforcements, the Japanese army surrounded the Chongqing army's positions ten kilometers southwest of Longling, and fierce fighting is underway. Although the Chongqing army had made some forward progress south and southwest of Longling, it has lost the two heights about eleven kilometers northwest of Mangshi on the Burma Road again. The Chongqing army is now using American-made flamethrowers to attack the Japanese army's special fire points on Songshan, near the Nu River crossing point.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to Chongqing, the war correspondent of the Chongqing Business Daily in Northern Burma recently exposed the inside story of the Ledo Road campaign, and declared that the fishermen's army is currently holding resentment towards Stilwell and even the British army. The general idea is that, according to Stilwell's original battle plan, the 77th Brigade of the British Indian Army, which belonged to the Second Army, was responsible for the offensive against the Moungaung area in Northern Burma. The 111th Brigade and 74th Brigade of the Third Division were responsible for opening a 29-kilometer section of the road between Moungaung and Kamaing. However, the 77th Brigade failed to advance towards Moungaung, and the aforementioned two brigades were trapped on the high ground by the Japanese army. The three brigades of the British Indian Army were unsuccessful. Now Stilwell is asking the Chongqing New Burma Eighth Division to take on more tasks.</p>

<p>Southwest Pacific Japanese Military Headquarters, 2nd (Central News Agency) An enemy air squadron attacked the Minado area of Celebes Island, twice, first with two large aircraft on the 1st, and then with seventeen fighter-bombers on the morning of the 2nd. The pure Japanese air squadron and Japanese army artillery fire engaged the enemy separately, and shot down five planes. In addition, the enemy also attacked Kaimana in southwestern New Guinea with about forty small aircraft on the 1st, and attacked Ternate on Halmahera Island with more than ten fighter-bombers on the afternoon of the 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e5">American Reporter Reports on the Hunan War Situation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 2nd, the Hunan war situation is as follows: The Japanese army is now changing its method of pressing against the Chongqing army in the Hengyang area, advancing west along the Xiang-Gui Railway from a point less than thirty kilometers away from Hengyang instead of attacking towards the Xiang River from the north. A large Japanese force has advanced from Laiyang to a point eighteen kilometers southwest of the city, and then turned towards Changning, south of Hengyang, and is now only nine kilometers away from the city, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chongqing army. If the Japanese army occupies Changning, it can cooperate with the southward troops and use Changning as a base for attacking the Xiang-Gui Railway, and concentrate its efforts to encircle and suppress the Chongqing army fighting southwest of Hengyang. The Chongqing military authorities believe that the target of the Japanese army's offensive is limited to this and is not a real start to a large-scale southward operation. However, the Japanese army is actively transporting supplies to the vicinity of Hengyang, implying that the current offensive will develop into an offensive towards Guilin. If this becomes a reality, it will have many impacts. Also, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 1st that fighting occurred east of Yongfeng, and confirmed that the air base and water of Zhejiang Province have been lost.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Li Yulin published a message to the armed groups in Chongqing on the 1st. The general idea is that the anti-resistance compatriots should understand that the time for overall peace has matured, embrace the belief of peace and construction, and jointly build Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Current Situation in Guilin is Extremely Chaotic <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) Since the fall of Hengyang, Guilin has become increasingly shaken. On the 30th, Chongqing Broadcasting also admitted that the Japanese army will inevitably attack, so Guilin has fallen into a state of extreme chaos. The current situation in Guilin, according to Chongqing Broadcasting, is as follows: Guilin is taking all possible defensive measures in preparation for the Japanese army's new actions from Hengyang. Almost all citizens have been organized into volunteer corps, and a "wounded soldier care circle" has also been formed. In addition, military supplies and military warehouses are being rapidly equipped. From September 1st, all vehicles in the city have been requisitioned, and the Guangxi Provincial Government has also actively begun to restrict the removal of food from the city. On the other hand, due to the Japanese army's offensive against Hengyang, ordinary people or general residents have come here to seek refuge, causing the commercial situation to become more chaotic. And unscrupulous merchants who profiteer from the war are even more rampant and cannot be contained.</p>

<h3 id="e9">The 85th Japanese Parliament to be Convened on the 6th, Prime Minister to Deliver Policy Speech <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Koiso Cabinet, in view of the fact that the war situation is gradually entering a decisive stage, previously decided to convene the 85th extraordinary session of the parliament on the 6th of this month. The purpose of the convocation is nothing more than to enable the people to thoroughly understand the important policy guidelines of the Koiso Cabinet, and to unite officials and people from top to bottom to complete the war. The proposals to be discussed in the parliament are supplementary budget for temporary military expenses and general accounting budget for increasing agricultural production, etc. It is expected that legal cases will not be discussed. The most noteworthy aspect of this parliament is the policy speech by Prime Minister Koiso at 4:00 pm on the 7th, and the war situation reports by the Army and Navy Ministers. As for the speech on diplomacy by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, it may be suspended, but in answering questions at the budget general meeting, the Foreign Minister will reveal his beliefs regarding the current international political situation.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Chongqing's recent removal of the former "Xinjiang Province Chairman" Sheng Shicai to serve as the Minister of Agriculture has been regarded by the Associated Press Washington telegram and the New York Times as a kind of flattery to the Soviet Union by Chongqing. It is said that this is the most important adjustment of the provincial chairman since the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in 1927. However, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, said that this is only a domestic adjustment, and cited the previous examples of Zhang Qun serving in Sichuan Province and Wu Dingchang serving in Guizhou Province to argue strongly. However, Sheng Shicai's transfer of his border territory built over more than ten years and his 40,000 subordinates to the control of Chongqing in exchange for a seat as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is not merely a regular adjustment.</p>
<p>According to reliable opinions from Chongqing, in order to strengthen Xinjiang's right to speak and its stance, it is of course necessary to remove Sheng Shicai, who is pro-Soviet. However, he has contributed greatly to Chongqing's development of the northwest since 1942. Especially since the conflict between Chongqing and the Outer Mongolian army at the end of last year, what Britain and the United States have felt indignant about is not Chongqing's expansion to Xinjiang, but their hatred of Xinjiang's advance towards Chongqing.</p>
<p>The United States has paid special attention to Sheng Shicai's transfer this time. The reason why they care about this is that they have deeply realized the danger of the Soviet Union wanting to contain the United States. The United States previously sent Wallace to Chongqing, and now sent Johnson to visit Chongqing, which seems to be the same. This can be considered the sincerity of the United States to aid Chongqing.</p>
<p>It is said that the mobilization of materials in the United States has reached its highest limit. However, their efforts to win over Chongqing are also revealing their ambition to develop the northwest. The wise Chongqing should avoid being unaware of their treachery!</p>
<h3 id="e10">Chongqing Replaces Sheng Shicai, Britain and the United States Reveal More Ambition <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States specially sent Wallace to visit Chongqing, it has been promoting that the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union has improved. If this is considered that Wallace is trying to mediate between Chongqing and the Soviet Union, it is better to say that this is due to Wallace's visit to Chongqing and the United States' ambition. Chongqing is in a dilemma. Sheng Shicai is also very sad because he has only completed the task of a puppet. However, Sheng Shicai should not complain about Chongqing's situation, because Chongqing has no other way. Therefore, making Sheng Shicai leave Xinjiang is a temporary victory for the United States' ambition to invade. Secondly, with Nelson's visit to Chongqing, Chongqing has to deal with its invasion with wise measures.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) The New York Post commented on the 1st on the Chongqing government's dismissal of the Xinjiang Province Chairman Sheng Shicai, saying that Sheng Shicai's dismissal has strayed far from the future world peace concerns held by the United States. However, according to a telegram from Chongqing, it can be known that Sheng Shicai's forced resignation is to improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Sheng's resignation this time will make the relationship between Chongqing and the Soviet Union more cordial in the future, which may be the biggest event in the Far East in the future.</p>

<p>Nancy, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News: In the villages near the Maginot Line in the Lorraine region, a large number of refugees have moved east. British and American aircraft have repeatedly flown low and fired at these refugees, causing many innocent deaths. It is still difficult to predict whether the Maginot Line will soon become a war zone. However, the German High Command can certainly use the Maginot Line's tank traps and other facilities to block the advance of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) Huitong News military commentator Antolius said: The German army's operational policy in the western theater is to set up new battle lines and withdraw the operational forces in the forefront of France. Although the German army has been cut off in many places by the superior enemy forces, it can still retreat while fighting. The enemy's operational policy is still to break into the Belgian area from the north of Compiegne and advance towards the Strait and the Flanders coast. Therefore, the US Third Army is advancing with heavy troops from the Verdun area towards the Lorraine basin and Longwy and Thionville, seemingly wanting to enter the area where the German army has set up new battle lines. The German counterattack the day before yesterday has blocked the enemy's advance towards the Lorraine basin. At the same time, the US army is advancing towards Mezieres, Charleville, and Vervins, and part of it wants to turn west towards Saint Quentin, with the aim of opening the way for the left wing of the US First Army to advance north. The British army is advancing east from the Amiens area, with the same effect. The British outposts have advanced north from the Amiens area towards Arras and Scarpe, and are advancing west along the Sensee River. Fierce fighting is currently underway. In addition, Canadian troops have now broken into the slopes of Le Havre and are advancing towards Dieppe. The fierce fighting in that area has reached its climax.</p>

Emphasize cultural exchange, absorb foreign culture, and supplement our own shortcomings. Provide practical education to the first generation of citizens of the country to prevent them from becoming decadent and impetuous." Finally, Dai praised and encouraged the principals of various private schools for their hard work in running their schools. Subsequently, the principals raised some pressing issues in the education sector, but they did not mention the serious fact that the number of students dropping out of school in Shanghai is increasing daily. According to what reporters have learned, the tuition fees for kindergartens in private schools are already over 3,000 yuan, which is generally inaccessible. It is hoped that the government can provide as much assistance as possible to various schools, and that schools can also reduce expenses as much as possible and automatically lower tuition fees, so that all students can receive education. The future of the country truly depends on this.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Queueing for Trolleys - Order Not Improved - Hope the Company Corrects <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Huazhong Metropolitan Transportation Company, in view of the fact that trolley passengers in this city often scramble to board, crowding and causing chaotic order, has repeatedly declared that trolley passengers must queue in order to board the trolley. At the same time, it has also assigned staff at each station to maintain order. This measure has contributed greatly to the safety of passengers and traffic order. However, recently, the company staff responsible for maintaining order at the stations often leave their posts when the trolley arrives, and allow those in uniform and their relatives and friends to scramble to board, causing passengers who abide by the order to often wait for half an hour and still be unable to board. This is especially true at the trolleybus stations from Jing'an Temple Road to Zhongshan Park. It is hoped that the company authorities will strictly correct the staff sent to maintain order to prevent the order from becoming chaotic.</p>

The letter stated: "Your newspaper is running a scholarship assistance campaign with great dedication. Our company is a citizen and cannot but be moved! Loving the children of the poor is to cultivate the vitality of the country. We are now offering 70,000 yuan, hoping that you will accept it. Due to limited resources, we are unable to do more. We hope that manufacturers in all industries will participate, which will be fortunate for the out-of-school youth and fortunate for the country!"</p>
<h3 id="e33">Bayer Pharmaceutical Donates Funds for Scholarship Assistance <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Bayer Pharmaceutical has a long-standing reputation for its contribution to the medical community in our country. Just in terms of scholarships, in addition to this donation of 50,000 yuan to our newspaper's scholarship assistance fund, which is specifically used for medical students' scholarships, the company has allocated huge sums to medical schools in Shanghai, such as the German Medical College, to set up scholarship funds, cultivating many useful talents for our country. The company also publishes the "Medical New News," which is widely distributed to various sectors to discuss medical techniques. Its "New Drug Encyclopedia" is all-encompassing. Recently, it has also published "Synopsis of Clinical Trials for Physicians of Temperate Diseases," which is a valuable book for studying temperate diseases.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Youth Middle School Rescues Out-of-School Students <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In view of rising living costs and soaring tuition fees, the Youth Association Middle School has set up an afternoon class to rescue out-of-school students. Both male and female students are accepted. There are equivalent classes from the first year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school. The fees are extremely low. Junior and senior high school tuition fees are 1,000 yuan each, miscellaneous fees are 200 yuan, and elective subjects are 300 yuan each. Due to the complete facilities and the concentration of talents, the curriculum standards are exactly the same as ordinary middle schools. However, since this measure is to rescue out-of-school students, it is necessary for students to have poor family backgrounds, excellent character and academics, and fill out an application form to be reviewed and approved before they can register for the entrance examination. It is heard that the examination is scheduled to be held at the school (address: 599 Sichuan Road) at 2:00 PM on September 8th.</p>

<p>— Pei Er Zi No. 155</p>
<p>Notice: It is hereby decided to distribute household coal balls and coal scraps from September 4th to 20th at various coal ball retail outlets in the former First District. Each certificate is entitled to 6 jin of coal balls and 2 jin of coal scraps, for a total price of 20 yuan in national currency. Citizens in the district can purchase from the coal ball retail outlets with the same number as the certificate using the Integrated Rationing Certificate No. 13 issued by the former First District Public Office (the originally issued unused sixth to eighth periods of coal ball certificates will be void). However, the numbers of each retail outlet have changed after the Integrated Rationing Certificate has been used. Citizens who are unclear can inquire at the certificate issuing office of this office. The coal distribution matters in the distribution area of the former Economic Bureau shall be handled after this office sets a deadline. In addition, the coal layer distributed this time does not contain any impurities, and the coal balls also contain 50% pure scraps. If the quality of the coal sold by various retail outlets does not meet the regulations, citizens can report the facts directly to this office for investigation. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. September 2, 33rd year of the Republic of China. Director Feng You.</p>
