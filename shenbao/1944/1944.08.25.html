<h2>Page 1</h2>
<h3>社評　巿政與人事</h3>
<p>「人人無事，事事無人」，這是陳市長在本年復興節日對市府職員訓詞中的話，是說中央以至地方政治上人事不健全的現象。我們認為這是陳市長在多年的經騐中，痛切的體味。政治不能修明，國家不能富强，基本原因實即在此。</p>
<p>最近出版的「地方行政」第十，十一期巾，陳市長發表了「今後上海的市政——人」的一篇文章，（轉載今日本報第一版）主要的指出，今後的上海市，祇是行政問題，尤其是人的問題，而不是區域問題。所以，他說：「上海市政以後能否樹立好的規樓，完全視乎人，現在區域和正在修正的章則差不多了，不要因用人」着之差，致誤上海市政的光明前路」。陳市畏把上海市政前途的光明，期待於用人上，正與我們向來主張相同。</p>
<p>我們很佩服陳市長的文章裏，坦白指出現在巿府所屬單位的用人方式，有很多專用同鄕的，或專用親戚的，而且不止專用其私人與親戚，並多偏袒其私人與親戚。陳巿長對這現象，雖然替一般機關擔憂，心內終不謂然，可是，因為尊重各單位的職權，不加干涉，而希望各單位的負責者，至少模倣巿長不用私人的作風。對此，我們略貢管見兩點：</p>
<p>第一，巿政的興廢，最高責任當然是巿長担負的。關係巿政興廢的，旣然以人事為主要，同時，旣已看到巿政各單位的用人方法不妥，那末，我們認為不能因為尊重職權而不加干涉。如果僅僅希望各單位負責者模倣巿長的用人作風，而不予嚴格的干涉與糾正，殊恐難收實效。則「用人一着之差，致誤上海市政的光明前途」，將不出所料吧！</p>
<p>第二，人事的不能健全，在任用者為不取人才主義，不能適人適事，不能賞罰嚴明。而在被任用者，一為本質的低劣，一為環境的驅使。本質的低劣，就是能力薄弱，品性惡劣，如果因同鄕或親戚關係，或因　緣而獲得位置，則其結果前者足以誤事，後者足以僨事。當其長官因同鄕或新廠關係而偏袒，則所任事務必然愈做愈糟，小之辦事效率不彰，矢之機關各舉毀損。環境的驅使，就是所得俸給不够最低限度的生活，可是，生活不能因而停止，於是在薪水以外謀取滿足，於是舞弊叢生，賄賂以行。其次，同事之間意志游移者，易受環境誘使衝動，漸致同流合汚。這兩種現象，在目前上海市政機關中，不必諱言的，所在多是。更不能不從銓叙甄試，及調整待遇入手。至於從根本上重施訓練，自為値得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>所以，我們主張市政府內設置人事委員會，專門從事市府所屬單位的人事管理，使市長的用人作風，由希望負責者模倣，進而為貫澈實施。人事委員會一方面為市畏用人的顧問，一方面為人事管理的實施單位，其職權與各局處相等。羅致公正不茍的人才主持之，延聘人事管理專家協助之。</p>
<h3>日政府昨續　召開地方　行政協議會　發揮行政效率並增强戰力</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本地方長官會二十三日舉行，當日即行閉幕，該會議因已由政府表明決意，並由地方長官熱烈提出意見，故結果極為圓滿。日政府繼於二十四日又假首相官邸召開地方行政協議會長會議，行政協議會長方面出席有西尾東京都長官及各協議會長，內務省方面出席者有大達內相，山崎次官等各關係長官，此次會議係以前日地方長官會議之結果為基礎，並以迅速增強戰力作中心，就行政效率之發揮上，作種種協議，故會議之結果頗堪注目。</p>
<h3>日翼贊會舉行各支部長會議</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本翼贊會二十三日地方長官會議閉會後，曾於首相官邸擧行全國都道府縣支部長會議，翼贊會方面出席小磯總裁，緒方副總裁及其他各局部長，開會後，首由小磯總裁與緒方副總裁致詞，並要求國民運動對於戰爭完遂上能予以最大貢獻，於致詞中小磯總栽並熏申翼贊會與政府之關係，謂兩者之一元化，固最為適當，但已決定於相當時期內保持現在機構。又緒方副總裁亦強調翼贊會之使命，謂國民運動之目的首在暢達民意，使之積極為國効命，以培養民心。</p>
<h3>越南總督德古　新權限內容　有指揮陸海空軍全權</h3>
<p>西貢二十四日中央社電　越南總督德古氏，於月之二十日依法國第九十號法令，受政府授予對戰時下越南所有行政必要時有獨裁之全權，已誌前訊，茲分誌其權限內容如左：</p>
<p>立法權：越南之立法權，本係操於法國國家主席之手，德古總督最初係受主席命令代其執行，可於某範圍內有立法權，於法國所頒布之法律及法令，是否適用於越南，總督對此有一月間考慮延期發展之權利，但至一九四〇年七月十一日後，總督立法種，已遠不如國家主席有力，即於本國內公布之法令，已不容越南再有考慮期間，惟此次德古總督自由政府獲得特　後，對越南巳有一切立法權，並遇有必要時，可制定實施任何法令。</p>
<p>外交權：總督過去於外交上本無何等恒久權限，如無本國政府許可，並不能對外有何交涉，唯必要時有基於政府之訓令與外國政府間成立協定倏約之權限。同時，對各國駐越南之使節，有維持外交關係之執行權限，但自此次獲得特權後，已有簽定條約等一切外交權限。</p>
<p>軍事上權限：總督過去於軍事上，僅有對越南陸海空軍之處理之權，即如遇外國侵略越南時，無總督許可，不能出動，但指揮權則操於陸海空軍各指揮官之手。此外，總督過國內外發生重大事態一時，有布告戒嚴之權限，但自此番新權限授予後，總督已為陸海空軍之最高指揮官，有指揮所有軍隊之全權。</p>
<p>財政上權限：過去總督對越南預算之編製，幾乎握有全權，唯稅制之管理權，仍由法國政府保留，又對於官公有土地之處理轄制，此次已將此一切保留與轄制各限制完全撤銷，即德古總督於財政上亦有同樣之行使全權。又德古總督不但為越南地區之外交，軍事，政治，司法上最高首領，同時又於太平洋上法領各島嶼及新德里多尼亞等各領地亦有同樣權限，日本與法國政府間尙未解決之一切問題，亦可由現地直接交涉，此外兩國間之緊密協力，實堪期待。</p>
<h3>雙方各趨極端　渝共妥協無望　彼此均不信任對方</h3>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　重慶延安間自七月以來，曾長時間進行和解交涉，但因兩者主張根本對立，交涉經過已遭重大困難。延安方面近曾以局恩來之名發表「中國仍未脫掉內戰危機」之聲明一，由於其對重慶之攻擊，已暴露其交涉全貌。紐約泰晤士報重慶特派記者對此問題，曾於廿二自述稱：兩者間由於此次交涉，政治不和已愈趨惡劣，邊區政體主席林祖涵於重慶勾留兩月，計與蔣介石會見一次，與蔣之代表王世杰及張治中會談多次。但重慶與延安立塲之懸隔，依然如故，其解決之主耍障碍，為彼此均不信任對方。重慶方面主張於中國國內不能有兩個政權存在，並主張所有軍隊必須置於重慶管下。但延安方面則認和解之基礎，在於中國立時民主主義化，但重慶則仍堅持於戰後樹立立憲民主主義之政策。林祖涵設明中謂延安方面現有兵力四十七萬，故此對重慶要求十公師兵力之裝備，重慶方面僅允許十師兵力之裝備。又重騰對共產軍，似曾主張有命令該軍離開邊區，至任何方面作戰之權限，延安方面則主張當承認各地方政權，使之合法化，但重慶已加拒絕。雨者在政治上之不和，主要為延安希望以合法政黨之一參加中國民主主義政治，國民黨方面，則堅持日軍佔領中國之廣大國土期中，中國尚不能樹立立憲民主政治。最近對外國記者團，及美國軍事使節團，曾發表謂，邊境地區與重慶地區兩者之對立，已稍緩和，惟重慶與延安之政治不和，仍極明顯。</p>

<h3>日駐泰大使　發表抱負</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　新任日駐泰大使山不氏，二十三日發表抱負如次：泰新任首相阿巴溫氏，與本人雖無深交，然因鑒於過去之事跡，故已對其人格深為敬佩’余深信此公為負起建設新泰國重擔之最當者。余深信日本大東亞政策係始終以貫澈賞行大東亞共榮，解放大東亞，謀東亞各國之興隆及確立為目的者，為達到此目的起見，必須先獲得大東亞戰爭之勝利，而於深切之同情及相互理解下，與大東亞各國提携，勇往直前，以底於成。</p>
<h3>朝鮮曾產　實施責任制</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據京城訊，朝鮮總督府鑒於鐵鑛增產為當前急務，特自本年度起實施生產責任制，以期增強鐵之生產，目前日本因急需鐵鑛，預料明年度朝鮮之鐵鎭之產量，當可較本年度增加數倍，因此總督府為期完成本年度鐵鑛之生產及整備明年度之增產工作，刻正研究各項對策。又因鑒於鐵鑛山之種種情形，故欲完成明年度朝鮮所定之增產量，當非易舉，因此關於北靑豐山聞廖等鐵鍍山增產工作之經登技術及其他事項，巳着手準備矣。</p>
<h3>南方木製船　安抵大阪</h3>

<h3>實部强化　訴願審委會</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　實業部鑒於各地主管官署，對於經濟案件之處理，難免有失出失入之處，故特將該部原有之訴願審理委員曾，加以強化。嗣後對於受理人民或　體申請之訴願案件，依照訴願法之規定。在最迅速公正這原則下，隨到隨辦，隨辦隨結。倘如認為原處分官署之裁定，確有失當者，即可予以糾正，　以解除人民痛苦。按過去地方官署之行政處分，人民團體如有不服其裁定者，得申述理由向中央主管機關提起訴願，此為訴　法明文所規定。故此次實業部之強化訴願審理委昌會，實為今後經濟案件處理上合理有效之措施。</p>

<h3>今後上海的巿政——人</h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>上海自去年七月三十日及八月一日分別收回法租界及公共租界，以至現在，剛剛一年，其初是第「（即舊公共租界）和第八（即舊法租界）兩區先行合併，至今年八月一日，更把第一區取消，對於上海市的區域重行訓分，這種措置是合理的，而且對於行政是必要的，今後對於市區域的劃定，我認為可以無憾，祗有看我們今後對於行政怎樣邁進罷了。</p>
<p>我對於以前租界的存在區域，固然不滿，對於收回租界以後的暫存區域，也是不滿，我想不止我一個人如此，就是一般的市民也有同感吧，旁的理論不必說，我們只要把地圖打開一看，有租界存在時，上海的市區域好做人身內挖去一個心臟，在租界收回時，上海的市區域好像一個人的心臟特別擴大。挖去心臟，一個人便不能生存，特別擴大心臟，而且更是奇形突兀的擴大，一個人還是病態沉重。所以我一年來的增法，要上海市的行政上軌道，先須從重新劃定區域始，現在好了，一年來的心血，總不算白費，今日劃定區域，我敢斷言至少可以適用至五十年。</p>
<p>我請大家注意的，今後的上海市，祇是行政問題，尤其是人的問題，而不是區域問題，我不盼望大家對於區域作無謂的更改，祗盼望大家對於行政特別加以注意，說到今後上海市行政，應興應革者還多，我今天祗提出幾點綱要。</p>
<p>第一，現在上海有兩派意見，其中市政府的職員也有，市民也有，一派對於過去工部局的制度還有留戀，以為一切制度還應保存，尤其職員待遇，更要絲毫不能改變，一派以為中國旣然收回租界，所有章則都應立刻要從中國法令，又不止法令，連科員擬稿，科長改稿，秘醫核稿等習慣都應該維持，我以為道兩派意見雖然極端，但可以一言敝之，都是保守派，不過保守的方式和意見不同罷了，前一派對於工部局不止留戀，而且還有許多誤解，最少可以說，誤認工部局的職員待過是一種好的文官制度，殊不知工部局以前許多章則是對殖民地的辦法，而待遇則合文官制度和公司的職員待遇而成，今日我們收回租界，一定要把國內法令全部實施的，勵行文官制度我是第一個贊成，然而必須把公司的職負待過隊去，使之成為純制度才算合理，後一派則完全囿於習慣，而蔑視許多事實，什麼是事實，就拿中國的公文來說也有很多可議的地方，積壓一也，拖延二也，繁重三也，遲緩四也，若要數下去，還有許多弊病，如果是十全十美，行政院內也不會設立行政效李委員會在那裹研究了。其實說，中國對於地方政府的行政，是取均權王義的，無論省市，都有制定單行法規之權，就是稅率，地方也極富有自由伸縮餘地，道樣，我們對於地方行政，儘有迴旋的效能，又何必一成不憂，墨守往日的習慣，我盼望今後一般單位的當局，對於法律和事賞，兩方並顯，不要固執，不要偽私，上海的市政，必有進步。</p>
<p>第二，用人方面，我是最替一般機關擔憂的，我到上海二年多了，我沒有所謂私人，更沒有所謂「班底」，還是一般人所共見的，但我常常見許多單位，也有專用間鄕的，也有專用親威的，我雖尊重各單位的職權，不加干涉，可是我心內終不謂然，我不是說私人一定不好，親威也一定不好，不過我常見各單位，不止專用其私人與親戚，並且多偏袒其私人與親戚，我也知道這種惡習不止市政府為然，就是舊日的區公署和第一警察局也何嘗無私人的派別，不過雖然有派別，但職員進退，終有定章，不似中國官聰，像唱京　的，每逢每一班登合，連跑龍套也澈底更動。我盼望今後各單位的負責者，至少模仿我的作風，否則日日批許舊日官僚不對，而日日反蹈舊日官僚的覆轍。上海市政以後能否樹立好的規模，完全視乎人，現在區域和正在修正的章則差不多了，不要因用人一着之差，致誤上海市政的光明前路。</p>
<p>第三，上海的收人不少，而事業也獨多，事業是要經費的，我很恐懼我們日後第一是破壤財政的統一，第二是流於經費的浪費。譬如各單位許多是有收入的，但開會通過，當面誥賊，甚至三令五申，財政的總收總又做對了麼？現在統一以後，收入更多了，仍然像以前的泄杳，財政的統一是要破壞的。又譬如每一事粟，各單位就不負責，做一件事要一百萬的，一核下來人十萬也可以做了。我不懂為什麼每一個單位不能自已核實，而更須市府電為一度的核定？每一個單位都是市府的重要部門，照理論上可以負責，可以賞行，而現在的事賞則市府的秘書處和總會計處倒像和谷單位對立。如果照這樣情形，我以為不如廢止各單位，樣探都由秘醫處去辦為迅速，或則廢止秘盡處，而由各單位處理為妥當。要而言之，數年以來，據我經騐，市府的各機關，並不能發揮其功能，反而牽制其職掌。是不是制度不善呢？我以為完全是人事罷了。</p>
<p>我說下去，恐怕還是人的問題。從古以來永沒有百利而無一弊的制度，我深盼大家對於人事，對於自己，有澈底檢討的必要，更有澈底反省的必要。我們以後是不是要重新來一次根本訓練，我正在愼重考慮中。（轉載第十，十一破地方行政月刋）</p>

<h3>戶口粉移動限制　條文將加修正　粉麩統配處考慮改進</h3>
<p>關於上海區內之粉麩移動事宜，上海區粉麩統配處曾奉令擬訂上海區粉麩取締移動處理規則，於日前由粉麥統制委員會，召集市政府物品配給處及經濟保安處會商，確定公布施行。惟其移動處理規則第二項條文中規定，甲種移動證明書十市斤以上（適用於戶口粉），即係凡購領十巿斤以上之戶口粉，亦須請領移動證明書，因本市戶口人數每一戶之人口超過五人以上頗多，如依據處理規則請領證明畫，則不勝其繁，即市民購領戶口粉，頗感不便之處甚多，致引起各界之議論。記者昨特走訪上海區粉麩統配處，據稱此項關於粉麩移動處理規則，本處係奉令辦理，爲社會市民服務，以安定民生爲職責，至於粉麩移動或有未能週密與妥善之處，希巿民以及與論各界多多貢獻意見，自當隨時接受改善。現對於十巿斤以上之戶口移動證明書問題，復加以考慮改進。</p>
<h3>油糧統制會强化食油管理</h3>
<p>— 辦法不日公布施行</p>
<p>商統會油糧統制委員會日前鑒於油價騰躍，立即訂定上海地區食用油存貨臨時登記規則，通飭上海地區食用油業中日雙方公會所屬會員，依期辦理存貨登記，與買賣登記，俾得明瞭食用沒流通途徑及實存數量，而謀通盤籌劃合理之調節。自該規則公布後，一般沒商均已遵照規定前往公會辦理登記，油價亦因而猛降，惟査尙有不肖會員，曁業外人之大批囤戶，意存觀望，從中煽動，以為完遂其陰謀攏斷沒價之野心，以致油價復起漲風。油糧統制委員會為針對是項現象，更進一步取締而為萬全對策計，已經與有關方面協商就緖，訂立全强化管理上海地區食用油辦法，尅日即可公布施行。</p>
<h3>辦法內容</h3>
<p>據記者探息，油糧統制委員曾前訂之登記規則，在不明法制者觀之，以為公加壓力於同業會員，乃起誤會，其實法令規定，非同業公會會員，根本不得經營該食用油之買賣，即使爲同業公會會員，若意圖營利對生活時刑事特別法所嚴禁。此項該會新管理辦法之內容，除對於上海油商加以嚴格之管理外，並普及於製造商工廠之棧單，亦予以有效之處置，住戶存油，除有適當之數量外，亦加以相當限制，尤其對於營業用各業別之存油，絕對縮小其可能範圍。聞已由該會商同上海市政府及經濟保安處予以協助，預料油價可指日抑平，而不肖油商及業外囤戶，將自食其果。</p>
<h3>本年眞性霍亂尙無發現</h3>
<p>防疫常委舉行會議</p>
<p>第五次防疫常務委員會議，業於前日（廿三）舉行，出席者除副主任委員袁濬昌及永井勇，陳以道，柴田少將，陳業勤等常務委員外，陸署長潤之亦應邀列席。首由袁副主任委員濬昌，報吿注射人數，計第一期共注射三百十七萬九千三百七十人，以前第一區衛生處注射為最多，計九十萬八千一百十二人，其次爲市衛生局中心隊，計八十八萬二千二百七十五人，成績尙不差。第二期注射工作已於八月一日開始，到現在止，約共注射九十餘萬人，眞性霍亂患者迄無一人發現，對於第二期注射工作，衛生局正積極進行中，並採取强化注射方策。組織流動檢査注射混合隊數隊，請警局指派警士協助進行。次由陸署長致詞：大意謂對於本年度上海防疫工作，頗爲滿意，不過霍亂危險期，尙未過去，請各位更加努力，以期較第一期之成績尤佳。</p>
<h3>開掘井水應加消毒</h3>
<p>並謂對於民間開掘自流井作爲飲料一層，危險性頗屬重大，應予嚴密注意。繼由袁副主任委員謂關於井永問題，衛生局現正嚴密注意中，以後除嚴密加以指導，關於如何消毒外，擬利用報紙或電合宜傳，俾衛生智識較低之民衆，得以明白切身利書，有所警惕。至數星期前頗呈猖狂之腦膜炎，業自上星期末，已吿絕跡，惟最近細菌性痢疾勢頗猖獗，究其原因，大都衛生常識淺薄之巿民，飲食不愼不致。故最近衛生局對於出售冷飲及西瓜之小販，從事嚴厲取締，以杜一切疾病之來源。</p>
<h3>煤氣用量　將嚴格限制</h3>
<p>本市自來火公司不久即將嚴格限制煤氣用量，除軍事機關及家用烹飪外，其他非必要機關及大量消費者，將受嚴格限制，跳舞塲等塲所，業已停止供給，以後對旅館及飯店亦將停止供給。至於在過去數月間商業機關超過限量百分之四十四，醫藥業超過限量百分之二十至三十，而中日政府機關則超過百分之六十六，平均每日有用戶十餘家，因超過限度而被罰停止供給。</p>

        <h1>1944.08.25</h1>
<h3>Editorial: Municipal Administration and Personnel</h3>
<p>"Everyone has nothing to do, and everything has no one to do." This is what Mayor Chen said in his address to municipal government employees on the Restoration Day this year, referring to the unsound personnel situation in central and local politics. We believe this is a deeply felt experience for Mayor Chen after many years. The fundamental reason why politics cannot be rectified and the country cannot be rich and strong lies precisely in this.</p>
<p>In the recently published "Local Administration" Nos. 10 and 11, Mayor Chen published an article "The Future of Shanghai's Municipal Administration - People," (reprinted on the front page of today's newspaper), mainly pointing out that the future of Shanghai is only an administrative issue, especially a people issue, not a regional issue. Therefore, he said: "Whether Shanghai's municipal administration can establish good rules in the future depends entirely on people. The region and the rules and regulations being revised are almost complete. Don't let the difference in 'personnel appointment' ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration." Mayor Chen's expectation for the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration rests on personnel appointment, which is exactly the same as what we have always advocated.</p>
<p>We greatly admire Mayor Chen's article, which frankly points out that the current personnel appointment methods of the municipal government's affiliated units often exclusively use fellow villagers or relatives, and not only exclusively use their personal connections and relatives but also favor them. Although Mayor Chen is worried about this phenomenon in general agencies, he does not agree with it in his heart. However, because he respects the authority of each unit, he does not interfere, but hopes that the person in charge of each unit will at least imitate the mayor's style of not using personal connections. On this, we offer two humble opinions:</p>
<p>First, the rise and fall of municipal administration are, of course, the ultimate responsibility of the mayor. Since personnel is the main factor related to the rise and fall of municipal administration, and since the improper personnel appointment methods of various municipal units have already been seen, then we believe that one cannot fail to interfere because of respecting authority. If one only hopes that the persons in charge of each unit will imitate the mayor's style of personnel appointment without strict interference and correction, we fear that it will be difficult to achieve practical results. Then, "a difference in personnel appointment will ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration," will probably come as no surprise!</p>
<p>Second, the reason why personnel cannot be sound is that the appointers do not adopt the principle of talent, cannot match people to tasks, and cannot clearly reward and punish. As for those who are appointed, one is due to inherent inferiority, and the other is due to environmental pressure. Inherent inferiority means weak ability and bad character. If one obtains a position due to fellow villager or relative relationships or through connections, then the former will be enough to delay things, and the latter will be enough to ruin things. When their superiors favor them due to fellow villager or new factory relationships, then the tasks they undertake will inevitably become worse and worse. On a small scale, the efficiency of handling affairs is not obvious, and on a large scale, various undertakings of the agency are damaged. Environmental pressure means that the salary received is not enough for the minimum living standard. However, life cannot stop because of this. Therefore, one seeks satisfaction outside of salary, resulting in rampant corruption and bribery. Secondly, colleagues with wavering wills are easily tempted by the environment to act impulsively, gradually leading to assimilation. It is undeniable that these two phenomena are common in the current Shanghai municipal agencies. It is even more imperative to start with qualification examinations and adjust salaries. As for fundamentally re-training, it is a worthwhile consideration.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate the establishment of a personnel committee within the municipal government, specializing in personnel management of the units affiliated with the municipal government, so that the mayor's style of personnel appointment can be gradually implemented from hoping that those in charge will imitate it. The personnel committee serves as an advisor to the mayor on personnel appointment and as an implementing unit for personnel management. Its authority is equal to that of various bureaus and departments. Recruit fair and incorruptible talents to preside over it and hire personnel management experts to assist it.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Continued to Hold Local Administrative Conferences Yesterday to Enhance Administrative Efficiency and Strengthen Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Local Governors' Conference was held on the 23rd and closed on the same day. The conference was extremely successful because the government had expressed its determination, and local governors had enthusiastically put forward their opinions. The Japanese government continued to hold a meeting of the heads of local administrative conferences at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 24th. On the side of the heads of administrative conferences, Governor Nishio of Tokyo and the heads of various conferences attended. On the side of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Minister of Home Affairs Odata, Vice Minister Yamazaki, and other relevant officials attended. This meeting was based on the results of the local governors' conference held the previous day and focused on rapidly strengthening combat power, conducting various consultations on the exertion of administrative efficiency. Therefore, the outcome of the meeting is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Held a Meeting of Branch Chiefs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After the closing of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association's local governors' conference on the 23rd, a meeting of branch chiefs of all prefectures and prefectures was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. On the side of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, President Koiso, Vice President Ogata, and other heads of various departments attended. After the meeting, President Koiso and Vice President Ogata delivered speeches, requesting that the national movement make the greatest contribution to the completion of the war. In his speech, President Koiso also emphasized the relationship between the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the government, saying that the unification of the two is most appropriate, but it has been decided to maintain the current structure for a considerable period. Vice President Ogata also emphasized the mission of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, saying that the purpose of the national movement is to express public opinion so that it can actively serve the country and cultivate public sentiment.</p>
<h3>Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam's New Authority Includes Full Power to Command the Army, Navy, and Air Force</h3>
<p>Saigon, 24th (Central News Agency) - Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam was granted full dictatorial power over all administrative matters in Vietnam during wartime by the French Decree No. 90 on the 20th of the month, as previously reported. The contents of his authority are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Legislative Power: The legislative power of Vietnam was originally in the hands of the French head of state. Governor-General Decoux was initially ordered by the head of state to exercise it on his behalf and could have legislative power within a certain scope. The governor-general had the right to consider and delay the development of whether the laws and decrees promulgated in France applied to Vietnam for one month. However, after July 11, 1940, the governor-general's legislative power was far less powerful than that of the head of state. Even the decrees promulgated in the country did not allow Vietnam to have a period of consideration. However, after Governor-General Decoux obtained special powers from the Free Government this time, he has all legislative power over Vietnam and can enact and implement any laws when necessary.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Power: In the past, the governor-general had no permanent authority in diplomacy. Without the permission of the home government, he could not have any contact with foreign countries. However, when necessary, he had the right to establish agreements with foreign governments based on the instructions of the government. At the same time, he has the executive authority to maintain diplomatic relations with the envoys of various countries stationed in Vietnam. However, since obtaining special powers this time, he has all diplomatic powers, including signing treaties.</p>
<p>Military Authority: In the past, the governor-general only had the power to handle the army, navy, and air force of Vietnam. That is, when foreign countries invaded Vietnam, they could not be dispatched without the governor-general's permission. However, the command was in the hands of the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. In addition, the governor-general had the authority to declare martial law when major incidents occurred at home and abroad. However, since this new authority was granted, the governor-general has become the supreme commander of the army, navy, and air force, with full power to command all troops.</p>
<p>Financial Authority: In the past, the governor-general had almost full power over the preparation of the Vietnamese budget. However, the management power of the tax system was still retained by the French government. In addition, the restrictions on the handling of official and public land have been completely lifted this time. That is, Governor-General Decoux also has the same full power to exercise in finance. Moreover, Governor-General Decoux is not only the supreme leader of Vietnam's diplomacy, military affairs, politics, and judiciary, but also has the same authority over the French-held islands in the Pacific Ocean and New Caledonia and other territories. All unresolved issues between the Japanese and French governments can also be directly negotiated on the spot. In addition, close cooperation between the two countries is expected.</p>
<h3>Both Sides Tend to Extremes, Compromise Between Chongqing and the Communists is Hopeless, Neither Trusts the Other</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since July, reconciliation negotiations have been conducted for a long time between Chongqing and Yan'an. However, due to the fundamental opposition of the claims of both, the negotiation process has encountered major difficulties. Yan'an recently issued a statement in the name of Zhou Enlai, "China has not yet shed the crisis of civil war." Due to its attack on Chongqing, it has exposed the entire picture of its negotiations. A special correspondent of the New York Times in Chongqing once described the problem on the 22nd: Due to this negotiation, the political discord between the two has become increasingly worse. Lin Zuhan, chairman of the border region government, stayed in Chongqing for two months and met with Chiang Kai-shek once, and with Chiang's representatives Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong many times. However, the gap between Chongqing and Yan'an's positions remains the same. The main obstacle to its resolution is that neither trusts the other. Chongqing argues that there cannot be two regimes in China and that all troops must be placed under Chongqing's control. However, Yan'an believes that the basis of reconciliation lies in the immediate democratization of China, but Chongqing still insists on establishing a constitutional democracy after the war. Lin Zuhan stated that Yan'an currently has 470,000 troops, so regarding Chongqing's request for the equipment of ten divisions, Chongqing only allows the equipment of ten divisions. Moreover, Chongqing seems to have asserted the right to order the Communist army to leave the border region and fight in any area. Yan'an argues that local regimes should be recognized to legalize them, but Chongqing has refused. The main political discord between the two is that Yan'an hopes to participate in China's democratic politics as one of the legal parties. The Kuomintang insists that China cannot establish a constitutional democratic politics during the period when the Japanese army occupies a large area of Chinese territory. Recently, foreign reporters and the US military mission have stated that the opposition between the border region and the Chongqing region has eased slightly, but the political discord between Chongqing and Yan'an is still very obvious.</p>

<h3>Strengthening of the Ministry of Industry's Petition Review Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that the handling of economic cases by competent authorities in various places is inevitably prone to errors, the Ministry of Industry has strengthened its original Petition Review Committee. In the future, for petition cases accepted from the people or organizations, in accordance with the provisions of the Petition Law, the principles of utmost speed and fairness will be followed, and they will be handled and concluded as soon as they arrive. If it is believed that the ruling of the original punishing authority is indeed improper, it can be corrected to relieve the suffering of the people. According to the Petition Law, if people's organizations are dissatisfied with the administrative punishment of local authorities in the past, they may state their reasons and file a petition with the central competent authority. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry's strengthening of the Petition Review Committee this time is actually a reasonable and effective measure for handling economic cases in the future.</p>

<h3>The Future of Shanghai's Municipal Administration—People</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>It has been exactly one year since Shanghai recovered the French Concession and the International Settlement on July 30th and August 1st of last year, respectively. Initially, the Second District (formerly the International Settlement) and the Eighth District (formerly the French Concession) were merged. Then, on August 1st of this year, the First District was abolished, and the city area of Shanghai was re-divided. This measure is reasonable and necessary for administration. I believe the delineation of the city area is now satisfactory, and all that remains is to see how we progress in administration.</p>
<p>I was dissatisfied with the areas occupied by the former concessions, and I am also dissatisfied with the temporary areas that existed after the recovery of the concessions. I think I am not alone in this, and the general public probably feels the same way. There is no need to discuss other theories. We only need to open a map and see that when the concessions existed, the city area of Shanghai was like a person with a heart removed. When the concessions were recovered, the city area of Shanghai was like a person with a particularly enlarged heart. Removing the heart means a person cannot survive. A particularly enlarged heart, especially one that is strangely protruding, means a person is still morbid and heavy. Therefore, my approach over the past year has been that, in order for Shanghai's administration to get on the right track, it must begin with re-dividing the area. Now, things are better. The effort of the past year has not been in vain. Today, with the area delineated, I dare say that it can be applied for at least 50 years.</p>
<p>I ask everyone to note that the future of Shanghai is only an administrative issue, especially a people issue, not an area issue. I do not expect everyone to make unnecessary changes to the area, but only hope that everyone will pay special attention to administration. Speaking of Shanghai's future administration, there are still many things that should be promoted and reformed. Today, I will only present a few key points.</p>
<p>First, there are two schools of thought in Shanghai now. Some are government employees, and some are ordinary citizens. One school of thought still misses the past systems of the Municipal Council, believing that all systems should be preserved, especially the treatment of employees, which should not be changed in the slightest. The other school of thought believes that since China has recovered the concessions, all regulations should immediately follow Chinese laws, and not only laws, but even the habits of clerks drafting, section chiefs revising, and secretaries reviewing should be maintained. I think that although these two schools of thought are extreme, they can be summarized in one sentence: they are both conservatives, but their methods and opinions of conservatism are different. The former school not only misses the Municipal Council, but also has many misunderstandings. At the very least, it can be said that they mistakenly believe that the treatment of the Municipal Council's employees was a good civil service system. Little do they know that many of the Municipal Council's regulations were methods for dealing with colonies, and the treatment was a combination of civil service system and company employee treatment. Today, we have recovered the concessions, and we must fully implement domestic laws. I am the first to agree to implement a civil service system. However, we must remove the treatment of company employees to make it a pure system before it can be considered reasonable. The latter school is completely confined to habits and ignores many facts. What are the facts? Take Chinese official documents, for example. There are many questionable things: backlog is one, delay is two, cumbersome is three, and slowness is four. If we were to count them, there would be many more drawbacks. If it were perfect, the Executive Yuan would not have established an Administrative Efficiency Committee there to study it. In fact, China adopts a principle of balanced power regarding the administration of local governments. Whether it is a province or a city, they all have the power to formulate individual regulations. Even the tax rate allows local areas to have a great deal of flexibility. In this way, we have ample room for maneuver in local administration. Why should we be rigid and stick to past habits? I hope that the authorities of all units will pay attention to both laws and facts, and not be stubborn or selfish. Shanghai's municipal administration will surely progress.</p>
<p>Second, I am most worried about personnel appointments in general institutions. I have been in Shanghai for more than two years. I have no so-called "private individuals" or "inner circle," as everyone knows. However, I often see many units that either exclusively use people from their hometown or exclusively use relatives. Although I respect the powers of each unit and do not interfere, I ultimately disagree in my heart. I am not saying that private individuals are necessarily bad, or that relatives are necessarily bad. However, I often see that each unit not only exclusively uses their private individuals and relatives, but also tends to favor them. I also know that this bad habit is not unique to the municipal government. Even the old district offices and the First Police Bureau also had factions of private individuals. However, even though there were factions, the advancement and retreat of employees still had set rules, unlike Chinese officialdom, which is like singing Peking opera, where every time a new group comes in, even the extras are thoroughly changed. I hope that those in charge of each unit will at least imitate my style. Otherwise, they criticize the old bureaucrats every day, but repeat the mistakes of the old bureaucrats every day. Whether Shanghai's municipal administration can establish a good model in the future depends entirely on people. Now, the area and the regulations being revised are almost ready. Do not let a mistake in personnel appointments ruin the bright future of Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai has a lot of revenue, and also has many unique projects. Projects require funding. I am very afraid that we will first undermine the unity of finance, and second, fall into waste of funds. For example, many units have revenue, but meetings are held to openly embezzle, and even repeated orders are issued. Has the total revenue and expenditure of the finance been done correctly? Now that there is more revenue after unification, it is still being leaked as before, and the unity of finance is being undermined. Also, for example, each unit is not responsible for each project. A project that requires one million can be done with one hundred thousand after review. I do not understand why each unit cannot verify it itself, and why the municipal government needs to review it again? Each unit is an important department of the municipal government. In theory, it can be responsible and can be rewarded or punished. However, the fact is that the municipal government's secretariat and accounting office are opposed to the units. If this is the case, I think it would be better to abolish the units and have the secretariat handle everything quickly, or abolish the secretariat and have the units handle it properly. In short, according to my experience over the years, the municipal government's agencies cannot fulfill their functions and instead restrict their responsibilities. Is it because the system is not good? I think it is entirely a matter of people.</p>
<p>If I continue, I am afraid it will still be a matter of people. Since ancient times, there has never been a system with only benefits and no drawbacks. I deeply hope that everyone will thoroughly examine the issue of personnel, and themselves, and more thoroughly reflect on it. Are we going to have another fundamental training in the future? I am seriously considering it. (Reprinted from the Tenth and Eleventh Issues of the Local Administration Monthly)</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Household Flour Movement Will Be Amended; Flour Allocation Office Considers Improvements</h3>
<p>Regarding the movement of flour within the Shanghai area, the Shanghai Flour Allocation Office was ordered to draft the "Shanghai Area Flour Restriction and Movement Handling Rules." Recently, the Flour Control Committee convened a meeting with the Municipal Government's Commodity Allocation Office and Economic Security Office to discuss and finalize the implementation. However, the second article of the movement handling rules stipulates that a Class A movement certificate is required for ten or more catties (applicable to household flour), meaning that anyone purchasing ten or more catties of household flour must apply for a movement certificate. As many households in this city have more than five people, it would be cumbersome to apply for certificates according to the handling rules, and it would be inconvenient for citizens to purchase household flour, causing widespread discussion. A reporter visited the Shanghai Flour Allocation Office yesterday, and it was stated that the office is handling this flour movement processing rule under orders, serving the community and citizens, and taking the stability of people's livelihood as its duty. Regarding the flour movement, if there are any omissions or inadequacies, citizens and various commentators are welcome to contribute opinions, and improvements will be accepted at any time. The issue of household movement certificates for more than ten catties is being reconsidered for improvement.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Control Committee Strengthens Edible Oil Management</h3>
<p>— Measures to be Announced and Implemented Soon</p>
<p>The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, concerned about the soaring price of oil, immediately formulated the "Temporary Registration Rules for Edible Oil Inventory in the Shanghai Area," ordering members of both Chinese and Japanese guilds in the edible oil industry in the Shanghai area to register their inventory and sales on schedule, so as to understand the circulation routes and actual inventory, and seek comprehensive planning for reasonable regulation. Since the announcement of the rules, most oil merchants have complied with the regulations and registered with the guild, and the price of oil has dropped sharply. However, it has been found that there are still unscrupulous members and large-scale hoarding households outside the industry who are waiting and seeing and stirring up trouble, in an attempt to achieve their ambitions of monopolizing oil prices. In response to this phenomenon, the Oil and Grain Control Committee has further cracked down and, for the sake of comprehensive countermeasures, has consulted with relevant parties and formulated comprehensive measures to strengthen the management of edible oil in the Shanghai area, which will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Measures</h3>
<p>According to reporters, the registration rules previously formulated by the Oil and Grain Control Committee may be misunderstood by those who do not understand the legal system as putting pressure on members of the industry. In fact, the law stipulates that non-members of the industry guild are not allowed to engage in the sale of edible oil at all. Even if they are members of the industry guild, if they intend to profit from criminal acts that are strictly prohibited by special laws, the new management measures of the association include strict management of Shanghai oil merchants, as well as effective measures for warehouse receipts of manufacturers and factories. Oil storage for households, in addition to an appropriate amount, will also be subject to considerable restrictions, especially for oil storage for business purposes, the scope will be absolutely reduced. It is heard that the association has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Economic Security Office for assistance, and it is expected that the price of oil can be suppressed soon, and unscrupulous oil merchants and off-industry hoarding households will suffer the consequences.</p>
<h3>No Cases of True Cholera Found This Year</h3>
<p>Preventive Committee Holds Meeting</p>
<p>The fifth meeting of the Standing Committee on Epidemic Prevention was held the day before yesterday (23rd). In addition to Deputy Chairman Yuan Junchang and standing committee members Yongjing Yong, Chen Yidao, Major General Shibata, and Chen Yeqin, Director Lu Runzhi was also invited to attend. First, Deputy Chairman Yuan Junchang reported on the number of people injected, with a total of 3,179,370 people injected in the first phase. The First District Health Office had the highest number of injections, with 908,112 people, followed by the Municipal Health Bureau's Central Team, with 882,275 people. The results are not bad. The second phase of injections began on August 1st, and to date, about 900,000 people have been injected. No one has been found to have true cholera. The Health Bureau is actively carrying out the second phase of injections and is taking measures to strengthen injections. Several mobile inspection and injection teams have been organized, and the police bureau has been requested to assign police officers to assist in the process. Next, Director Lu gave a speech: The gist of which was that he was quite satisfied with Shanghai's epidemic prevention work this year, but the cholera danger period has not yet passed. He asked everyone to work harder to achieve even better results than in the first phase.</p>
<h3>Well Water Should Be Disinfected</h3>
<p>He also said that opening artesian wells for drinking water among the people is quite dangerous and should be closely watched. Deputy Chairman Yuan said that the Health Bureau is paying close attention to the well water issue, and will strengthen guidance in the future. Regarding how to disinfect, it is planned to use newspapers or electricity to publicize the public's self-interest so that the public with lower health knowledge can understand and be alert. Encephalitis, which was quite rampant a few weeks ago, has disappeared since the end of last week. However, the recent bacterial dysentery is quite rampant. The reason is that most citizens with poor hygiene knowledge are not careful in their diet. Therefore, the Health Bureau has recently been strictly cracking down on vendors selling cold drinks and watermelons to eliminate all sources of disease.</p>
<h3>Gas Consumption Will Be Strictly Limited</h3>
<p>The city's gas company will soon strictly limit gas consumption. Except for military institutions and household cooking, other unnecessary institutions and large consumers will be strictly limited. Dance halls and other places have already stopped supplying gas, and hotels and restaurants will also stop supplying gas in the future. In the past few months, commercial institutions exceeded the limit by 44%, medical institutions exceeded the limit by 20% to 30%, and Chinese and Japanese government agencies exceeded the limit by 66%. On average, more than a dozen users were fined and stopped supplying gas every day for exceeding the limit.</p>
<h3>Reader's Scholarship News: Generous Donations Continue Unabated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Anonymous sent in a scholarship of 30,000 yuan. The gentleman is not anonymous, because his purpose is only for a good cause. He only wants to help poor and out-of-school children, and only wants to help the country and society educate talents, to the best of his conscience. Therefore, he takes helping education as his purpose, and thinks that the purpose has been achieved by donating funds, and whether to leave a name or not is irrelevant. We are also deeply grateful to Mr. Shi and Mr. Xu of Yuan Da Flower Shop for donating 20,000 yuan together, with great enthusiasm for helping education.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a scholarship of 30,000 yuan from Mr. Anonymous (receipt number 7187), and 20,000 yuan together from Mr. Shi and Mr. Xu of Yuan Da Flower Shop.</p>

<h3>Minister of Justice Chen Discusses the Revitalization of Judicial Affairs and the Enhancement of Judicial Personnel's Treatment</h3>
<p>Minister of Justice Chen Enpu, in view of the fact that all civil and criminal cases must be resolved quickly in order to prevent the people from suffering innocent pain, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago to convene the heads of the four courts and offices in Shanghai to discuss effective ways to quickly resolve civil and criminal cases. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chen and was pleased to hear his remarks on the revitalization of judicial affairs in the future: "There are many things that should be promoted and reformed in judicial affairs today. It is difficult to do both talent and money at the same time. In fact, it is not possible. I believe that the most needed things at present are to improve the treatment of judicial personnel and improve the current situation of prisons. The treatment of judicial personnel has always been extremely poor, and it is even worse now. The monthly salary of a prosecutor in Shanghai is not enough to buy a stone of rice. Although there is a slight allocation of daily necessities, it is still far from meeting the needs of life. As the saying goes, people will know etiquette when they have enough food and clothing. Therefore, improving the treatment of judicial personnel is an urgent matter. When former Minister Zhang was in office, he requested and approved funds for fostering integrity, but the procedures have not yet been resolved. Once the consultation is properly arranged, it will be implemented as soon as possible. As for the prisons in various places, most of them lack better sanitation facilities, or there is no doctor when there is illness, or there is no medicine when there is a doctor. Therefore, the health of prisoners is extremely important. Although summer is over, if infectious diseases occur in autumn and winter, it will be even more worrying. I will follow the will of the late Minister Zhang and try my best to increase the medical equipment in various prisons, and the daily disinfection and epidemic prevention matters in prisons, in order to be effective in case of emergency. As for my visit to Shanghai this time, it is to discuss with the heads of the four courts on effective ways to quickly resolve civil and criminal cases, and to urge them to actively carry out the above-mentioned relevant matters."</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Control Committee to Handle Distribution</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Daily Necessities Control Committee has been actively carrying out collection and distribution work. The distribution of matches, candles, and soap in various regions will be implemented soon, and the local industry guilds will be responsible for handling it. Since the committee was first established, all affairs have been concentrated in the committee. There is currently no intention to establish offices in various places. Recent reports in various newspapers that the committee has established offices in Ning, Su, and Hangzhou are not true.</p>
<p>(Another report) The management of soap and candle distribution by the National General Chamber of Commerce's department for the control of soap and candle distribution has been handled by the association's soap and candle professional department. Now that the Daily Necessities Control Committee has been established, it should be merged. Yesterday (24th), a letter was sent to the association and the soap and candle professional department to implement the merger in accordance with regulations. It is heard that the Daily Necessities Control Committee will send personnel to take over within days.</p>

<h3>Shanghai North Property Owners Not Residing in Houses: Registration to be Carried Out on a Regular Basis, Starting September 1st for a Period of Three Months</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special Municipality Property Owners Not Residing in Land and Housing Management Committee's Shanghai North Office has been quite active in promoting its business. Recently, the office, in view of the large number of houses in the area, and in order to clarify the rights and interests of property owners in the area under its jurisdiction, has, upon the instructions of the municipal government, organized the registration of property owners not residing in houses in order to unify management. The registration methods are summarized below:</p>
<h3>Scope of Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The original scope of jurisdiction of the office was not large. Now, with the change in the boundaries of the city and the unification of administrative management, the scope of jurisdiction has been expanded.

<h3>Registration Methods</h3>
<p>As for the registration methods, the office will issue registration forms, which will be distributed by the police bureau and Baojia office to the property owners in each Lianbao, who will fill in the location, type of house, and value in the amount, and must submit property ownership documents (deed or land registration documents). After each household fills in the registration form, the Baojia office will submit it to the office, which will then send personnel to investigate and issue a certificate to protect the property rights of the property owners. The registration fees are divided into four types: Type A Western-style houses are 40 yuan, Type B city houses are 30 yuan, Type C multi-story buildings are 20 yuan, and Type D bungalows are 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Registration Dates</h3>
<p>The registration date is scheduled to start on September 1st and last for three months until November. If a property owner is not residing in the house and has not registered, or cannot prove his ownership in law, the office will investigate and take over the management and leasing of the house until the property owner completes the registration procedures, at which time a certificate will be issued and the house will be returned to protect his rights and interests.</p>
