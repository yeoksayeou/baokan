<p>社評</p>
<h3>堅忍不拔</h3>
<p>堅忍是一切成功的主要囚素，特別在大時代表，替民族國家做解放和復興工作的人們，哥哥都要有「堅忍不拔」「百折不撓」的勇氣，然後才能成功。我們讀孫中山先生的革命史，讀各國的興國史，看到當時許多人德奮　，前仆後繼，如火如荼，其時各方的阻礙，各種的挫折，眞是艱苦備嘗。可是他們以太無畏的精神，忍着困苦，堅定意志，勇往直前，不達目的，誓不終止。最後，在忍耐了無數的艱苦罧難以後，建國大業卒告成功。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是是被迫民族的反抗戰，是革命性的解放戰，從人類平等的原則上說，被壓迫民族的翻身是註定的，英美敵人殖民地政策的失敗也是註定的，可是在這解放道上，幹着革命工作的人們，必須要披荊斬棘，經歷無數挫折，忍受無數痛苦，然後方能把荊棘滿地的一條路，改造成功一條康莊大道。這個時代的人，在將來的歷史上都要寫出他們轟轟烈烈的經纖，而這些却都是把血和汁來寫成的。將來讀廢史的人看到我們現在的艱苦奮關，看到我們現在的堅忍不拔，正如我們現在看古代歷史，一般的崇敬和飲佩。這個維神上的無形力量，鼓勵現在的國民努力邀國，更鼓勵將來的國民刻刻進步，民族國家的綿延永久，就在於此。</p>
<p>要有堅忍不拔的意志，首先要樹立我們的自信力。喪失自信力的人，完全受環境的支細，給果除了做奴隸外沒有第二條路。有堅强自信力的人，可以支配環境，結果可以做環境的創造者。第二要有熱烈的毅力，繼績不斷的工作。半途而廢的工作等於沒有做，有時反比不做還要壞，只的始終如一的工作然後能夠成功。列子十上愚公移山的故事，難是一　寓言，却含有深當，愚公自信移山的必能成功，所以他雖然老了，偏要和山奮門，他廈要使他的子子孫孫繼續不斷的奮鬥，堅强的自信，熱烈的毅力，感動鬼神，於是移山終於成功。列子的愈思不過要借此說明，雖移山天事，只要堅忍不拔，奮鬥必成，其他的事總比移由容易些，如能堅忍不拔，那有奮鬥不成的道理。</p>
<p>遇見困難而「向後轉」最是要不得，有着「倒退」念頭的人，無論如何不能前進，無論如何不能威功。歷史上無數的大事，都在一部份人想「向後轉」，而一部份人繼續的勇往直前的時候。沒有充分的堅忍力，決不能達到最終的目的，所以在競賽事上，到達終點時最後五分鐘的努力，要比出發起步時珍賣萬倍。堅忍不拔的人，不知道困難，只知道工作，因此環境愈困雖，工作愈努力。他心中提本沒有危險的念頭，所以縱險如夷，他眼中根本不存着障礙的境界黠所以通障若空。憑着大無畏的精神，一步一步機繼續永久的努力奮鬥，前進一多即向目的地近一步，這就先堅忍力的效果，這就是堅忍力的咸功。</p>
<h3>馬利亞納島方面　日軍守備隊奮戰　迭尼安激戰敵傷亡五千名</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日下午五時發表：瑪利亞納方面之日革守備部隊其後之奮戰狀况如次：　大宮島之敵軍日登陸後，於明石街及昭和街之中心地區受實大損失，臼軍現正在明石衛北方地區整理縮短戰綫而響戰中。　迭尼安島北部地區，自敵軍登陸以來，日下以寡兵阻止强力之敵軍南下，並予以重創，至三十一日敵軍突入該烏南部之“軍最後抵抗綫，戰綫呈錯線狀况。　羅特島日革於敵軍連日之盛烈飽擊轟炸下，奮戰防止敵軍之登陸。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地一臼中央社電　迭尼安島臼守備隊，刻仍繼續與敵軍激戰中，敵於飛機及艦上砲擊掩護下，一再企圖突進，十六日拂曉以來，日軍堅守中央高地，予敵人重創，並將敵軍擊退。又日軍據漂匙方高地，亦予敵以甚大損害，依然確保原來陣地，十六日予敵之損害，計死亡達七百之衆，敵軍自登陸以來，總計傷亡達四千九百名。</p>
<h3>中樞昨隆重舉行　復興節紀念儀式　溫院長讀汪主席訓話</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　一日為我首屆中華復典節，際此大東亞戰爭決勝階段，我國得擺脫列強侵略之梏鎖，而開始更生既失之權利，完成獨立目主之國家，其意義之重大自不待言。是日除全國各地律舉行慶祝儀式外，重樞方面特於是日上午九時，假國府大禮堂隆重舉行紀念儀式，到各院部會處長官百餘人，九時正大會開始，由司法院溫院長領導，行證如儀後，繼即由主席訓話（溫院長代表恭讀），大會九時半始於軍樂鏗鏗聲中宣告題幕。</p>
<p>主席訓話</p>
<p>今灭是中華民國第一屆的復興節，也就是中華民國開始廢除不平等條約，完成獨立自由平等的偉大紀念日，中國受不平等條約桎梏已有一百年的歷更。在這一百年中，因爲領土和主權的支離破碎，使政治，經濟不能自由發展，而陷於長崎混亂和貧困的狀態，所以欲復興中華，非先求得自由平等，欲求自由平等，非先廢除不年等條約不可，這是國父一生的心願，幾十年來國民黨同人前後繼續努力，從去年八月一日收回上海粗界起，已完全實現了。從此以後，中國才得到自由平等，開始踏上自力更生的復興大道，還是在歷史上劃時代的盛舉。</p>
<p>但是廢除不平等條約，不過是復興事業的起點，欲求復興大衆的完成，仍有待於全國同志，和政府同人繼續努力。今臼中國正面臨着最嚴重的時代，國內方面，因為渝方繼績從事實目抗戰，社會經濟組織已殘確不堪，今後對於保障治安，增加生產兩項工作，需要我們加緊努力。國外方面，大東亞戰爭現已進入決戰階段，勝利基礎雖已確立，但敵人仍狹其豐富物資，不斷的拼命反攻，我們為確保國家的獨立，自由，尤須竭盡所能，與盟邦緊密協力，以求得大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>所以在第一屆復興節的今天，我們一方面感覺興奮，一方面又感覺到本身貴任的重大，我們惟有一致努力向前邁進，以復興中華，保衛果亞。</p>
<h3>衡陽附近戰事　達最高潮</h3>
<p>日軍基地一日中央社電　渝軍為救援衡陽之守備軍，於上月初自以第四十四·第五十八·第二十·第三十及第三百四十三軍，由體陵·茶陵方面衝向日軍側面，以第六十二·第六十五軍自南方向衡陽正面進擊，使第咸軍南下，但在東西聯賞體陵，茶險之綫上，有日軍布下之鐵壁之陣，對於潛行而來之渝軍，日軍於七月十日一齊開始攻擎，隨處不嫻將其擊減，南進部隊二十日於桶戶橋（衡陽西約八公里）對第百九十四師主力，將其擊減，刻正以一部確保新悠（衛陽西約八公里），追擊百九十四師敗殘部隊。又一部隊奇製於衡陽東北二公里半欲構築陣地之第百六十二師予以殲誠打擊，更有一部正攻擊潸入衡陽西北八公里小雲山殿附近之第百軍主力，如是衡陽周邊之擊滅渝軍戰，漸達最高潮。</p>
<h3>渝美機襲漢</h3>
<p>漢口一日中央社電　駐渝美空軍三十日晚十時半起約歷一小時半，以統一式B24型機十架左右，侵入武漢地區，盲炸江地帶，被日軍以熾列防空砲火擊退，日方損害輕微，但華人住宅起火，並有若干傷亡者。</p>
<h3>接受上海租界一週年紀念　吳秘書長廣播詞</h3>
<p>各位同胞：去年今天，上海兩租界同時交還中國，中央政府因為收回上海兩租界的意義非常重大，興復興中棄的前途有英大的關係，所以規先這一天為中華後興備，今天也就是第一屆的中華復興節日。</p>
<p>陳市長在今天發表的「一年來市行政制度的變革」一文裏面，對收囘上海租界一年來市行政制度的變遷，說得非常明白，非常透徹，本人是參加收回上海租界工作的一分子，同時一年來也參加過上海地市政工作，對陳市長所說當時的一外在得困難」和「內在的困難」能深切體認，好在經渦一年的努力，在陳市長的領導之下，在友邦方面協助之下，在諸位諮詢委員和市民德督促和贊助之下，從重種的方面說來，不能不說有了相含的收度，正如陳市長所說：「面憶一年過去，時期不長，而威效卓著，私心得以慰藉者在此，市政府得以告無罪于市民者亦在此」，今天我們興奮的在這表慶祝首屆中戲復興節，慶祝收聲上海租界一周年紀念，也就在此。</p>
<p>治安經濟問題</p>
<p>不過，上海市政雖然元全統一了，「外在得困難」雖然全部消滅了，「內在的困難」也可以希望逐漸的解除，但是擺在前面的工作還很多，還上需要我們繼縱過去一年來的奮鬥精神努力的做去。所謂擺在前面的工作是些什麼工作呢？也就是陳市長所說的「治安問題」和「經濟間題」，治安問題是非常重要的，要先從四鄉的治安做起，先做到四鄉治安安定，才可以求上海市區的治安安定。關於這一點，行政督察專員公署咸立之後，預料吾比校好一點的措施。純濟問題，百要的恐怕就是糧食問題，關於這個間題，「物品配給處」成立以後，也可以希望有更好的解決辦法。戶口米的配給量，市府常局已經不單是考慮怎樣繼續下去，並且考慮怎樣增加配給的數量，這一點是值作提出來先告訴各位的。總而言之，上海市政當局，沒有一天不在尋求有效的辦法，來解決上海的經濟問題，以及一切的市政問題，因為過去有種種的困難不能一時做到，更引起一部份市民的疑慮，我們固然並不惡意禁止中民發生疑慮，不過有的時候正像陳市長所說的只能「斷然不顧」，因爲市政的改革和進行，我們有一個整個的計劃，本着這個計劃做去，不但可以樹立市政的信用，還可以要得眞正的改革，所以絕不輕言妄舉，也不斤斤於博得一時市民的喜悅。</p>
<p>恢復市民本質</p>
<p>各位知道，上海百年來在英美帝國主義者的壓迫下，變成了一個畸形的複雜的都市，英美為了推行種種政治與經濟的侵略勢力，便把上海租界成為藏垢納污的中心，把許多李樂，須廢，茍且，僥倖，放任的腐化習氣，無形中改變了上海市民的本質，間接還把上海成為一個十足享樂的腐化的都市。同時英美帝閑主義者更利用上海為根據地，把腐化的習氣傳播到中國全國各地去，把中戲民國固有的風俗，習慣，文化，改變了本來而目。因此我們可以說治理別的地方容易，上海是英美帝國戲義者百年來侵醉中過擄據地，所以我們就應該還用所有的力量，使上海變成為純等中國式的商場，東方式的都市，使上海變成復興中國經濟和文化的根據地，必須這樣做，才能徹底的消滅後美勢力，才能使中國主體獨立，人民得到自由。</p>
<p>完成偉大使命</p>
<p>講到我們中華民族，在幾年來中日實獲得磨練中，在大東亞戰爭　發以來的現實教訓之中，雖然遭遇了空前的劫運，却是堅定了民族奮鬥的決心。步伐更加一致，意志也更加統一，對友邦日本的眞識援助，也隨着種種事實的開展，而益爲確信。可是我們應深省人必自伐而後人悔之，國必自伐而後人伐之，只有自己能夠振作，自己能夠爭氣，自己家重視。人家的援助，到那時俟不單上海的市政問題，可以迎刃而解，整個國家的問題也可以迎刃而解，到那時候，四百多萬上海市民共日傾注中華的復興節，共日紀念上海租界的收回，當然更有意義更有價值，同胞們，我們要力，我們耍干萬人一心協力大上上海，完成我們偉大的使命。</p>

<h3>原田公使遭脅辱　日本提嚴重抗議　指摘英美兵違犯國際法</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　當英美軍侵入鄰馬時，會遠犯國際法，侵入臼駐教廷使節官邸，對享有完全治外法權之日駐教廷原田公使以次館員，出以暴行事件，纖外務省當經酉班牙致府對該兩國提嚴重抗議，於一日下午三時就其不法行為發表如次：近據日政府經羅馬教廷所得日戰教廷原田公使電稱：該公使以次全體館員等在英美軍侵入羅罵後，目六月六日以來即被監禁於該使節官邸內（亂馬市內），而此間美兵會數次侵入官邸，該公便乃斥其不法，要求被等退去，但彼等不特以極不馮之態度辱罵該公使，甚欲出以危害公使安全之脅迫態度。按交戰國外交官於敵國佔領區內，亦當享受與數國同樣之待過，此乃國鄉間之常例，不但已為各闕所公認，旦此等外交官與普通之敵國民不同，須以特別敬意優待之，如當大東亞戰爭開始之際，英美駐華外交官由當地官憲予以與駐東京之各該國外交官大致同樣之待遇。美軍佔領羅馬後，在原田公使移往梵蒂罔前，自當與以同樣待過，尤其原田公使乃係派駐教廷之公使，尤其按「東迭蘭」條約規定巳承認於義國領土內得享受外交官之待遇，雖美所政府亦不能完全貌視此條約之存在。上述美兵行為，可謂完全漠視對外交官特別待遇之國際法，而為指輝官者亦不知阻止此種總犯文明國問國際禮議之兵土野蠻行為。日政府以其軍紀紊無秩序，特經由利益保護國西班牙政府向美政府提出嚴重抗議，指摘其不當行為。原田公使及其館員於七月九日始得移往梵蒂岡，茲判明已不致有何危險。</p>

<h3>昨首屆復興節　全市熱烈慶祝　陳市長對市府職員懇切訓話</h3>
<p>昨日為首屈復興節，全市民衆熱烈慶祝，國旗飛揚，各要衝路口，宜傳處特佈置長額慶祝標語，氣象莊嚴，此外各街道四壁滿貼標語，民心極為振奮。市府方面，為集中力量，特於昨日遷至江西路一區公署原址，即在大禮堂舉行復興節紀念儀式，陳市長借同吳秘書畏准時出席，各科科長以上長官參加者共計二百餘名，由警局豉笛隊在塲奏樂，行體如儀，全體　祝主席健康，旋由市長致詞，歷半小時始告禮成。</p>
<p>市長訓詞</p>
<p>陳市長對市時職員訓話云：秘書長，各位局處長，各位職員們今天是大上海市政府市政眞正統一的第一天。關於一年來上海市政制度變遷的經過，以及本人在一年中對于上海行政的理想和政策已經載在我所著的「一年來上海市政制度的變革」一文，諸位今日想己在各報「看到，不必贅述了。一年中我們己經盡了我們應書之力，同時也己經盡了我們應負之責，使得今天上海市政得以迅速統一，本人于此時向各位致謝，幷向日本己去職及仍受聘的各職員致謝。今天我所要設的，是市政府的內部問題，換言之，就是市政的本身問題，也就是公務員的本身間題。第一，上海自有市政府以來，市行政就是不完整的，如管轄的範圍，祇是在兩租界以外的，過去中國方面，也會有兩次，對付租界的政策，第一次是包圍租界，那就是築成軍功路，即是今日的中山路，使租界被包關於一定區域之中，因為那是租界正想不斷的擴大，故不得不採取「包圍限制」的政策。第二次是孤立租界，那就是市中心的建築，即是江灣萬市府的建設，當時在市中心，劃定工商業各區，更建築虬江碼頭，很明顯的想在租界以外繁榮上海，更想以水陸交通來截斷租界的工商業，使租界孤立。這兩次對付租界的政策，凡是關心於市政的都很明瞭，然而盟附於道兩個政策而來的計劃，都不免有畸形設展，和牽强事實的狀態，在當時是無可如何，在今日是已成過去。我希望一般服務市府的職員，在收回租界之後，無當把上海視為整個的，修正從前牽强事實的觀念，對於上海未來的發展，應作一個　然的計劃，這是上海現在和未來市政一個根本間題，希望大家澈底了解的。</p>
<p>蠲除成見打破積習</p>
<p>第二上海市政府今日包括三部份職員，一部份是舊日市政府的警貝，一部份是舊日公共租界的職員，一部份是舊日法租界的職員，這三部份職貝，各有其經騐，各有其習慣，總括一句話，據我一年內的觀察，各有各的優點，亦各有各的缺點，優點不必說，而共同的缺點，則在於成見太深，在舊臼市府的職員，往往太重公文，而忽略行政的效率，在舊日兩租界的職員，又往往太偏於慣例，而輕視由國的法規。現在市政巳告統一，我很盼望各位不止要和衷共齊，而且更要　除成見，打破積習，地方行政是要活潑的，因為要活潑，應該對於日常公文，講求效率，講求改革，地方行政是要有軌道的，因為要有軌道，應該對於中國法規，務求依據務求齊一，大家不應蔑視事實，更不應忽略中國的法規，更應時時講求進步，一以應地方的實情，更可以作中央和地方的參考。第三，我盼望各位努力去做一個好的事務官，這句話是我半生的痛苦經騐，也是我以後對於中國政治前途的希望。據我體騐，無論中央與地方，欲求一個好的事務官百人之中沒有一人，更可以痛乎言之，千人之中也我不出一人。</p>
<p>人人物事事無人</p>
<p>中國本來是一個農　社會，國民因為環境的關係，往往流於空想，而忽於實際，我所見的事務官，每每志大而才疏，慾者而意意，沒有一個人肯盡崗位的賣任，沒有一個人肯守份內的職責，以故自中央以至地方，無不人人無事，事事無人，國家的政治，無論如何良好，行政必須有人，今則其人亡，其政息，其人存，而其政亦不舉，各位如果肯勢力做一個好的事務官，幷且僅得怎樣才可以做一個好的事務官，不獨上海有希望，即中國的前途，也有希望。現在上海市政是統一了，而行政也完全極於中國人之手了，我盼望各位本於一年來的成績，更加努力，如此上可以對國家，下可以對市民，將來上海有着無窮進步，本人亦與有榮焉。</p>

<h3>市警察總局　昨正式成立　全市警政已告統一</h3>
<p>上海特別市警察總局，於昨日首屆中華民國復興節正式宜告成立，即行開始辦公，中午復舉行茶會，由陳兼局長親蒞訓話。茲將各情分誌於次：</p>
<p>全局人員情緒昂揚</p>
<p>市警察總局於昨晨正式宣告威立，陳兼局長及蘆蘇兩副局長均到局視事，所有新任該局各科處室人員，悉行報到，十一時許，陳兼局長分批接見僚屬，由廬蘇兩副局長分別率領晉謁，陳兼局長備致慰勉，全體晉謁人員，無不感習，情緒尤為昂揚，午後因復興節特休假半日，停止辦公，以示隆祝。</p>
<p>陳兼局長茶會致訓</p>
<p>中午十一時三十分許，該同全價人員集合七樓警察俱樂部內，舉行茶會，全體向陳兼局畏致敬後，一二兩警局人相互致敬，嗣由陳兼局長起立致訓云：訓局長，各位處長，各位官長們，今日上海的警察行政，已和上海的市政，同時宣告統一，我深願說設我對各位今後的期望。</p>
<p>第一；今日服務於警察局各位，有些是第一經察局的職員，有些是第二警察局的職員，有些事第三警察局的職員，我知道凡是一個單位，必定有一個單位的歷歷史，有了一個單位的歷史，就有一個單位的習慣和見解，何况第一警察局以前是公共租界的巡捕房改組，第二警察局是原來市政府的然察局改稱，而第三警察局是以前法租界巡捕房的沿革，各有各的章則不同，各有各的謂練不同。今日宜告統一合併，將來或者每個人均有行之不素之盛。但雖然各有歷史和習慣，而服務地方，保衛人民的目的，則無不同。今日上海警政已告統一，我盼望各位捐齊過去的成見，放棄過去的習慣，朝着統一於中國法令之途邁進。中國自有其警察法規，各人本於已往經騐，循規以行，上海的警政當必有張足的進步。同時盼望各人忘記已往畛城，不要雖住你是第一局的，我是第二局的，或是第三局的，須知今日大家都是屬於統一的警察局，巳經沒有你我畛域之分第二了，各位應該知道警察是國家的公務員，而不是一個被　者，無論局長處長警官是一個公務員，就是一個警士也是一個公務員，公務員在國家中有他的身份，在政府中有他的地位，在本身更有他的責任。在過去的租界，未免祗着軍於　術的訓練，而忽時於公務員本身的修查。現在租界經已收回，各位部是地方有貴有守的官吏，而不是一種被　人，我盼望各位對於這點澈底明瞭，更耍澈底使一般長警明瞭。</p>
<p>第三，中國古書有句話：「入國而問禁，入門而問禮」，禁就是有所不應為，禮就是有所應為，禁與禮可以表示一國是否有秩序，由是否有秩序的表現，可以推知一國的强弱。我們警察的執掌，禁與禮都有了，維持治安，固然是警察的職責，就是肅正風俗，指導文化，警察也有其職員。從前中國以縣長偉親民之官，在今日的中國，親民之官，無過於警察，於此可見我們警察的責任和任務重大了。我們固然不能擾民，除了保民之外，還負有指導人民之貝。一年以來，我是一固警察當問，但是我吳自省和負責，上海警政實在還沒有做到合乎一般人德理想。今日警政已宣告統一了，從今日起我盼望各位提起務神，以保衛大上海和促進大上海為己</p>
<p>自去年收回租界以至今日，各位可謂對於維持安寗秩產，勢力不懈，今日在警政統一之時，我應當向各位致謝的。我更希望各位在統一以後，加倍努力，須知安完上海，即所以安定大東亞的後方，能夠復興上海，也是可以復興中國，我祝各位的努力，更視各位的光關前涂</p>
<p>統轄全市各區警政</p>
<p>該局對上海特別市政府所管轄之市中心區（市區）及市郊區域等全市各區警政統一管轄，除對前第一二兩警察局所管轄之各分局，均直接管轄外，並對直屬各縣長官轄下之臨醫察局長，得隨時指揮監督之，並設縣警事務室，專任指導監督各縣區之警政事宜。至於管轄之各分局，計　市中心區為黃浦，老閘，新成，靜安寺，江寗路，普　路，虹口，西虹口，北四川路，新市街，提藍橋，榆林路，楊樹浦，泰山，廬家灣，常熟路，華山路，長寗路，邑廟，閘北，中華路，斜橋，東昌路，徐家匯，等廿四個分局。　市郊區為江灣，高橋，　華，楊思，羽林路，洋　，滬北等七個分局。　市鄉區為南匯，北橋，聲山，川沙，奉賢，嘉定，崇明等七縣警察局。</p>
<h3>第二區　曠專員視事</h3>
<p>上海特別市第二區行政督察專員公署昨日正式成立，曠專員運文偕問隨員等於是日上午十時抵南　蒞新，首至專員公署視事，　後至南翔商會，出席崇　嘉三縣民衆歡迎會會。</p>
<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>高中及大一學生明日考試</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金本屆申請學生之持有高中各級或大學一年級之登記證者，定於明日下午三時在大同大學考試，隨帶鉛筆（毛筆及墨水筆不適用）及登記證市民蹬，其有市民證已經遣失或姓名與登記蹬上不一律，而未曾繳過相片者，必需隨帶相片，否則考試無效。</p>
<p>本報同人捐款助學</p>
<p>本報同人鑒於本屆助學金需款浩繁，而發放臼期又極迫促。爰自動湊集十萬元，捐充助學金，際此海　，同人辦理學生申請手續，相當繁劇，更感於助金支絀，復盡棉力捐助，聊示出力又出錢之微意。</p>
<p>昨收捐款　本報同人十萬元，結存九百四十一萬六干四百六十六元。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>拋磚引玉</h3>
<p>本報第七屆助學金，正在舉辦甄別考試，俟手紋辦竣，即開始分發助金。但預計申請及格學生，假定助金標準，衡之目前收存款數，仍感悉不數甚鉅。有賴於讀者諸公熟忱奮發，綱續輸損者，更爲殷切。</p>
<p>晨近同業新烈聞報，為貸學金募款，剏設搶救失學義勇隊及普及隊，成績斐然，足見社會人士對於搶救失學，情緒熱烈。我們一方面感到社會重視教育，同具達大目光，不奮復興前途最可賽貴的一點泉源。一方面深佩同業先進的呼籲有方，發生了無上效力。我們站在助學的立塲，更覺目標相同，有着同樣的安慰。</p>
<p>可是，為了從速達到同一目標的終點，我們也時刻想使盡棉力競走往前，因此，一方面還是仰賴讀者諸公源源捐助，同時，本報同人自動湊成十萬元，捐充助學金，聊表出方又出錢的微意。如能拋磚引玉，藉以獲得各界更廣大的捐助，尤是同人所　香禱祝的。</p>

        <h1>1944.08.02</h1>
<h3>Unyielding Perseverance</h3>
<p>Perseverance is the primary element of all success, especially in this great era, for those who work for the liberation and revival of the nation and the country; everyone must have the courage of "unyielding perseverance" and "never giving up," and then they can succeed. When we read the revolutionary history of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the national revival histories of various countries, we see that many people at that time devoted themselves to struggling, one falling as another rises, like a raging fire. The obstacles from all sides at that time, and the various setbacks, were truly a taste of all hardships. However, with a spirit of utter fearlessness, they endured hardships, strengthened their will, and advanced bravely, vowing never to stop until they achieved their goals. Finally, after enduring countless hardships and difficulties, the great cause of nation-building was successfully completed.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a resistance war of oppressed peoples, a revolutionary liberation war. From the principle of human equality, the emancipation of oppressed peoples is destined, and the failure of the colonial policies of the British and American enemies is also destined. However, on this road to liberation, those who are engaged in revolutionary work must cut through thorns and brambles, experience countless setbacks, and endure countless pains, before they can transform a road full of thorns and brambles into a broad and smooth avenue. The deeds of the people of this era will be written in the future history in a magnificent way, and these deeds will be written with blood and sweat. Future readers of history will see our current arduous struggles, and our current unyielding perseverance, just as we now look at ancient history, with general respect and admiration. This invisible power in the spiritual dimension encourages the current citizens to strive for the country, and also encourages future citizens to make constant progress. The continuation and perpetuity of the nation and the country lies in this.</p>
<p>To have an unyielding will, we must first establish our self-confidence. People who lose self-confidence are completely subject to the details of the environment, and as a result, there is no other way but to be slaves. People with strong self-confidence can control the environment, and as a result, they can be creators of the environment. Secondly, we must have a warm and persistent will, and continue to work tirelessly. Work that is abandoned halfway is equivalent to not doing it at all, and sometimes it is worse than not doing it. Only work that is consistent from beginning to end can succeed. The story of Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains in Liezi is difficult, but it is a fable that contains profound meaning. The Foolish Old Man was confident that he would succeed in moving the mountains, so even though he was old, he insisted on fighting the mountains. He also wanted his children and grandchildren to continue to struggle constantly. Strong self-confidence and warm perseverance moved the gods, and so the moving of the mountains was finally successful. Liezi's story only wants to use this to illustrate that even moving mountains, a task as difficult as defying Heaven, can be achieved if one is unyielding and persevering. Other things are easier than moving mountains. If one can be unyielding and persevering, how can there be any reason why one cannot succeed in their struggles?</p>
<p>Encountering difficulties and "turning back" is the most undesirable thing. People who have the idea of "retreating" can never move forward, and can never succeed. Countless major events in history have occurred when some people wanted to "turn back," while others continued to advance bravely. Without sufficient perseverance, one can never reach the ultimate goal. Therefore, in competitive events, the effort in the last five minutes of reaching the finish line is ten thousand times more valuable than the effort at the start. A person with unyielding perseverance does not know difficulties, but only knows work. Therefore, the more difficult the environment, the harder they work. There is no concept of danger in their hearts, so they treat danger as safety. There are no obstacles in their eyes, so they see obstacles as empty. Relying on a spirit of utter fearlessness, they continue to struggle permanently step by step. Advancing one step brings them one step closer to their destination. This is the effect of perseverance, and this is the success of perseverance.</p>
<h3>Mariana Islands Area: Japanese Garrison Fights Bravely, Fierce Battle on Tinian Inflicts 5,000 Casualties on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 1st: The subsequent state of the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison forces in the Mariana Islands area is as follows: After the enemy troops landed on Omiya Island, they suffered substantial losses in the central areas of Akashi Street and Showa Street. The U.S. troops are currently consolidating and shortening their battle lines in the area north of Akashi and are engaged in fierce fighting. In the northern area of Tinian Island, since the enemy troops landed, our troops have used a small number of soldiers to prevent the strong enemy forces from advancing southward and inflicted heavy damage on them. On the 31st, the enemy troops broke into the "final resistance line" in the southern part of the island, and the battle lines are intertwined. The Japanese troops on Rota Island are bravely fighting to prevent the enemy's landing under the continuous fierce shelling and bombing by the enemy forces.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – The U.S. garrison on Tinian Island is still continuing to engage in fierce fighting with the enemy forces. Under the cover of aircraft and naval gun fire, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to break through. Since dawn on the 16th, our troops have firmly defended the central highlands, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and repelling the enemy forces. Also, our troops, based on the Piaoshi Fang highlands, have inflicted substantial damage on the enemy and are still securing their original positions. The damage inflicted on the enemy on the 16th is estimated to be 700 deaths. Since the landing, the total casualties of the enemy forces have reached 4,900.</p>
<h3>Solemn Commemoration Ceremony Held Yesterday in Central Government for Restoration Day; President Wen Reads Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The 1st is our first Chinese Restoration Day. At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, our country has broken free from the shackles of the great powers' aggression and begun to restore its lost rights, completing an independent and sovereign nation. Its significance is self-evident. On this day, in addition to celebration ceremonies held throughout the country, the central government especially held a solemn commemoration ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government. More than a hundred officials from various ministries and departments attended. The conference began at 9:00 AM. President Wen of the Judicial Yuan led the proceedings, and after the ceremony, Chairman Wang's address was delivered (President Wen read it on his behalf). The conference concluded at 9:30 AM amid the resounding sound of military music.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Today is the first Restoration Day of the Republic of China, which is also the great commemorative day for the Republic of China to begin abolishing unequal treaties and completing independence, freedom, and equality. China has been shackled by unequal treaties for a hundred years. In these hundred years, because the territory and sovereignty were fragmented, political and economic development could not be free, and it was trapped in a state of prolonged chaos and poverty. Therefore, to revive China, we must first seek freedom and equality, and to seek freedom and equality, we must first abolish unequal treaties. This was the lifelong wish of the Founding Father, and the comrades of the Kuomintang have continued to work hard for decades, and it has been completely realized since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions on August 1 last year. From now on, China will have freedom and equality, and will begin to embark on the road to self-reliance and revival. This is still a landmark event in history.</p>
<p>However, the abolition of unequal treaties is only the starting point of the restoration undertaking. To complete the revival of the masses, we still need the continued efforts of comrades throughout the country and government officials. Today, China is facing the most serious era. Domestically, because the Yu faction continues to engage in resistance, the social and economic organization has been severely damaged. In the future, we need to intensify our efforts in two tasks: ensuring security and increasing production. On the foreign front, the Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. Although the foundation for victory has been established, the enemy is still using its abundant resources to continuously launch desperate counterattacks. To ensure the independence and freedom of the country, we must do our utmost to cooperate closely with our allies to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this first Restoration Day, we feel excited on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel the gravity of our responsibilities. We can only work together and move forward to revive China and defend Asia.</p>
<h3>Battles Near Hengyang Reach Climax</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – In order to rescue the defending army of Hengyang, the Yu army launched an offensive from the direction of Liling and Chaling at the beginning of last month with the 44th, 58th, 20th, 30th, and 343rd armies towards the flank of the Japanese army, and the 62nd and 65th armies attacked the front of Hengyang from the south, causing the 10th army to move south. However, on the line connecting Liling and Chaling in the east and west, the Japanese army had laid down an iron wall of defense. For the Yu army that was sneaking in, the Japanese army began its attack on July 10, annihilating them everywhere. The southward advance troops attacked the main force of the 194th Division at Tonghuzhai Bridge (approximately 8 kilometers west of Hengyang) on the 20th, annihilating them. Part of the force is currently securing Xinyou (approximately 8 kilometers west of Hengyang), pursuing the remnants of the defeated 194th Division. Another force inflicted a devastating blow on the 162nd Division, which was constructing positions 2.5 kilometers northeast of Hengyang, and another force is attacking the main force of the 100th Army, which has infiltrated near Xiaoyun Mountain, 8 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. As such, the battle to annihilate the Yu army around Hengyang is gradually reaching its climax.</p>
<h3>Yu-US Aircraft Attack Wuhan</h3>
<p>Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency) – From 10:30 PM on the 30th, approximately ten unified B-24 aircraft of the Yu-based US Air Force intruded into the Wuhan area for about an hour and a half, blindly bombing the river area. They were repelled by the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Japanese army. The damage to the Japanese side was minor, but Chinese residences caught fire, and there were some casualties.</p>
<h3>Speech by Secretary-General Wu on the First Anniversary of the Recovery of the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>Fellow compatriots: Today last year, the two concessions in Shanghai were simultaneously returned to China. The central government believes that the significance of recovering the two concessions in Shanghai is very significant and has a great relationship with the future of the revival of China. Therefore, it stipulates that this day is the Chinese Revival Day, and today is also the first Chinese Restoration Day.</p>
<p>In the article "Changes in Municipal Administrative System in the Past Year" published by Mayor Chen today, the changes in the municipal administrative system in Shanghai over the past year since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions are explained very clearly and thoroughly. I am a member of the team that participated in the work of recovering the Shanghai concessions, and I have also participated in Shanghai's municipal work for the past year. I can deeply understand the "external difficulties" and "internal difficulties" that Mayor Chen mentioned at that time. Fortunately, after a year of efforts, under the leadership of Mayor Chen, with the assistance of friendly countries, and with the encouragement and support of the advisory committee members and citizens, it must be said that there has been considerable progress in important aspects. As Mayor Chen said: "Recalling the past year, although the period is not long, the effectiveness is remarkable. I can be comforted in my heart, and the municipal government can be declared innocent to the citizens." Today, we are excitedly celebrating the first Chinese Restoration Day and the first anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions for this reason.</p>
<p>Security and Economic Problems</p>
<p>However, although the Shanghai municipality has been completely unified, the "external difficulties" have been completely eliminated, and the "internal difficulties" can hopefully be gradually resolved, there is still a lot of work ahead, and we still need to continue the fighting spirit of the past year and work hard. What are the so-called works in front of us? That is, the "security problem" and the "economic problem" mentioned by Mayor Chen. The security problem is very important. We must first start with the security of the four townships. Only by achieving the security of the four townships can we seek the security of the urban area of Shanghai. Regarding this point, after the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office, it is expected that there will be better measures. Regarding the economic problem, the most important thing is probably the food problem. Regarding this problem, after the establishment of the "Commodity Rationing Office", it can also be hoped that there will be better solutions. The municipal government is not only considering how to continue the rationing of household rice, but also considering how to increase the amount of rationing. This point is worth mentioning to tell you all first. In short, the Shanghai municipal authorities are seeking effective ways to solve Shanghai's economic problems and all municipal problems every day. Because of various difficulties in the past, it could not be done at one time, which has aroused the doubts of some citizens. We certainly do not maliciously prohibit the emergence of doubts among the citizens, but sometimes, as Mayor Chen said, we can only "disregard it resolutely," because we have an overall plan for the reform and progress of the municipality. By following this plan, we can not only establish the credibility of the municipality, but also achieve genuine reforms. Therefore, we will never make reckless moves, nor will we be concerned about gaining the momentary joy of the citizens.</p>
<p>Restoring Citizen's Essence</p>
<p>As you all know, under the oppression of British and American imperialists for a hundred years, Shanghai has become a deformed and complex city. In order to promote various political and economic forces of aggression, Britain and the United States have made the Shanghai concessions the center for hiding dirt and harboring filth, and have invisibly changed the essence of Shanghai citizens with many corrupt habits of laziness, laziness, expediency, fortune-seeking, and indulgence, and indirectly made Shanghai a completely pleasure-seeking and corrupt city. At the same time, British and American imperialists used Shanghai as a base to spread corrupt habits to all parts of China, changing the original customs, habits, and culture of the Republic of China. Therefore, we can say that it is easier to govern other places, but Shanghai has been a stronghold for British and American imperialists to invade China for a hundred years, so we should also use all our strength to turn Shanghai into a pure Chinese-style market and an Eastern-style city, and make Shanghai a base for the revival of Chinese economy and culture. Only by doing this can we completely eliminate the forces of the United States and make China's main body independent and its people free.</p>
<p>Completing Great Mission</p>
<p>Speaking of our Chinese nation, in the training we have received in the Sino-Japanese War over the past few years, and in the practical lessons since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although we have encountered unprecedented calamities, we have strengthened our determination to fight for the nation. Our pace has become more consistent, our will has become more unified, and our true understanding of the friendly country of Japan's assistance has become increasingly certain with the development of various facts. However, we should deeply reflect that a person must be insulted by others before they repent themselves, and a country must be attacked by others before they attack themselves. Only if we can cheer ourselves up, only if we can fight for honor, and only if our own family values it. The assistance of others, at that time, not only Shanghai's municipal problems can be solved easily, but the problems of the entire country can also be solved easily. At that time, the more than four million Shanghai citizens will jointly celebrate the Chinese Revival Day and jointly commemorate the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, which will of course be more meaningful and valuable. Compatriots, we must work hard, we must work together with one heart and one mind to build up Shanghai and complete our great mission.</p>
<h3>Burma Has Regained Freedom; Vows to Uphold War of Independence; Ba Maw Expresses Deep Gratitude to Japan in Broadcast</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – On August 1, the first anniversary of Burma's independence, Burmese Head of State Ba Maw made a broadcast speech, stating that Burma, which has regained freedom, is determined to uphold its independence and expressing the Burmese people's deep gratitude to Japan. The main points of his broadcast are as follows: The Burmese people are deeply moved to celebrate the first anniversary of independence. The Burmese people must quickly remember that Burma has returned to Burma, and with the assistance of years and months, the enemy will eventually be driven out of the country, and freedom will finally return. Those who have not experienced being conquered may not be able to understand the feelings of the Burmese people today. Now, what we rely on is only new unity. Burma has gained leaders in the past year. A new Burmese nation, built on Burma's constitution, national flag, politics, army, national language, and basic laws, has been born. Reform policies for general administration, finance, agriculture, industry, education, social welfare, and other basic matters have also been implemented. An army that can participate in modern warfare has also been formed. Burma has now gained international status and has become a free and healthy member of the Greater East Asian nations, that is, Burma for the Burmese people, and Asia for the Asian people, which is constantly changing and promoting its extension. On this day of great significance, we will always uphold the war of independence. In the future, in addition to adhering to the gains of the war, we must also be aware that any freedom must be sacrificed under the overall war. War is one of the most important parts of our lives. Burma is waiting for the war to enter the decisive stage, just like other war zones. Our war this time is for our own survival, and all Burmese people should deeply understand this principle. The Burmese people vow to fight to the end until the problems of Burma and Asia are thoroughly resolved. We are grateful to the underground heroes and the brave soldiers who fought on the front lines. At this moment, I not only remember the independence that the Burmese people should regain this time, but also the sacrifices made for it. Burma's independence depends on the aid of Japan in many ways. Regarding this point, I have mentioned it intermittently in the past, and on this Independence Day, the connection of thanking Japan most is the most appropriate time. After all, the rebirth of a country should be based on reality. However, this cannot be achieved by one-sided words. I often represent all the Burmese people on the Independence Day and extend my commemorative remarks to the Japanese people and the people of East Asia, as well as Germany and other comrades-in-arms who respect human rights and freedom.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Broadcasts: Wishing Burma the Completion of Permanent Liberation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso made a broadcast speech on the night of the 1st, wishing Burma good fortune and emphasizing his determination to complete the war and thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Declaration in accordance with the established policy. The main points are as follows: The Burmese people, who have groaned under British oppression for many years, and whose traditional culture has also been trampled on, immediately rose up when the Greater East Asia War broke out and finally obtained the independence they desired, and their national ideals have also been realized. This close cooperation is based on the idea of Greater East Asia liberation, and the fundamental concept of building a world with moral spirit is consistent. The 17 million Burmese people have demonstrated their ardent patriotism and indomitable fighting spirit, and have been able to overcome difficulties, complete the great cause of building a new country, and actively cooperate in completing the common war, which has achieved brilliant achievements. In addition, the domestic construction is being prepared step by step, and the national life and spirit are showing vigorous signs. It is admirable to have these achievements in the current war situation, and it shows the future prosperity of Burma. Currently, the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense in the Pacific and is entering an important stage. Japan, at this important stage, is determined to break through all difficulties, with the virtue of finishing what it starts, and make new efforts throughout the country. Recently, the cabinet has been changed, and I and General Yonai have been ordered to strengthen the domestic situation with national unity internally, and continue to advance towards the path of defeating the British and Americans in order to achieve the final victory. Externally, we will thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the established diplomatic policy. At this time, Japan has a full understanding of Burma, the front line of Greater East Asia. At the same time, the Japanese people have full respect for Burma under the guidance of the British Head of State, who can endure everything and make its national foundation increasingly firm. Indeed, glorious victory is won with great risks. Burma's independence will surely become more and more consolidated. Greater East Asia, united in moral spirit, should cooperate with each other to resist strong enemies. This is the way to victory. On the anniversary of the independence of our allied nation, Burma, in the midst of fierce battles, I sincerely express my happiness and wish Burma a strong nation, completing permanent liberation with an indomitable fighting spirit and promoting the Greater East Asian spirit.</p>

<h3>Soviet Vanguard Troops 10 Kilometers from Warsaw; German Troops Retreat from Kaunas</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: Soviet troops advancing towards Warsaw are within 10 kilometers of Warsaw. The situation inside the city is still normal. The sound of tank warfare can be heard from the east, causing people inside the city to panic.</p>
<p>East, 1st (Central News Agency) - Hai Tong News Agency reports: German troops destroyed all facilities and equipment before withdrawing from Kaunas (also known as Kovno, the capital of Lithuania). The people of Kaunas have been evacuated to the countryside. The houses in the city are closed or locked. The houses between the Neman River and the Vilija River are protected by strong iron bars. Only one house destroyed by bombs can be seen in the entire city. An old cleaner is still sweeping the garbage in the middle, as if he is indifferent to the evacuation of all the people in the city.</p>
<h3>Turkey Facing Major Crisis; German Ambassador Issues Warning</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, visited Turkish Prime Minister Sukru Saracoglu because of rumors that Turkey wanted to sever diplomatic and commercial relations with Germany. Mr. Papen seriously told the Turkish Prime Minister that if Turkey took this step under British pressure, it would deprive Turkey of the freedom of action it had long enjoyed. Britain undoubtedly wants to force Turkey to join the war and make Turkey bear all the serious consequences. The Turkish government is now facing a major crisis.</p>
<p>National Assembly Convened Today</p>
<p>Ankara, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: On Monday night, all Turkish cabinet members and representatives of the Turkish Grand National Assembly had arrived in Ankara. Turkey is now standing at the threshold of a major decision. Before the parliament meets, the parliamentary members of the Republican People's Party will hold a secret meeting, and the Turkish President will also participate, because he is the president of the party. It is likely that the government's decision will be submitted to the parliament for discussion. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the highest authority in the country and is vested with legislative and executive powers. The final decision on important national events rests with the assembly.</p>
<p>Political Atmosphere Suddenly Becomes Tense</p>
<p>Budapest, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: Although Turkish ambassadors and ministers to various countries have taken their vacations in advance, they have been returning to their posts one after another since the 29th. It has now been learned that Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Ali Kan, who returned home, arrived in Ankara from Istanbul on the 30th. Also, the ambassadors and ministers to various countries from the reverse factions held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 29th and reached an agreement.</p>
<h3>Minister Harada Subjected to Coercion and Humiliation: Japan Lodges Strong Protest, Pointing Out Violations of International Law by British and American Soldiers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Regarding the incident in which British and American forces, upon invading Rome, violated international law by intruding into the residence of Minister Harada, the Japanese envoy to the Vatican who enjoys complete extraterritorial rights, and subjecting him and his staff to violent actions, the Foreign Ministry, after contacting the Spanish government, lodged a strong protest with the two countries. On the afternoon of the 1st, a statement regarding this unlawful behavior was released as follows: "According to a telegram received by the Japanese government through the Holy See in Rome from Minister Harada, the Japanese envoy to the Vatican, he and all members of his staff have been confined to the diplomatic residence (within Rome) since the British and American forces invaded Rome around June 6th. Furthermore, American soldiers have repeatedly intruded into the residence. The Minister condemned their unlawful actions and demanded their withdrawal. However, they not only insulted the Minister with extremely rude language but also threatened his safety. According to international norms, diplomats of belligerent nations in occupied territories are entitled to the same treatment as those from neutral countries. This is universally acknowledged. Moreover, these diplomats are distinct from ordinary enemy nationals and should be treated with special respect. For instance, at the outset of the Greater East Asia War, British and American diplomats in China received roughly the same treatment from local authorities as their counterparts in Tokyo. After the American occupation of Rome, Minister Harada should have received the same treatment before relocating to the Vatican. Particularly, as Minister Harada is accredited to the Holy See, and the 'Lateran Treaty' recognizes his diplomatic status within Italian territory, even the U.S. government cannot completely disregard this treaty. The actions of the American soldiers mentioned above completely disregard international law regarding the special treatment of diplomats. Furthermore, the commanding officers failed to prevent such barbaric acts by soldiers who are ignorant of the international etiquette of civilized nations. The Japanese government, citing the lack of discipline and order among the troops, lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government through the protecting power, Spain, denouncing their inappropriate behavior. Minister Harada and his staff were finally allowed to move to the Vatican on July 9th, and it is now confirmed that they are no longer in danger."</p>
<h3>Administrative Unification of Northern and Southern Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the 29th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government received an order from the Executive Yuan regarding the administration of Northern Jiangsu, authorizing the Special Inspector of Pacification for the area to handle matters as appropriate. Now, due to the establishment of administrative inspectors in the Northern Jiangsu area, Hua Zhendong, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District, Zhang Beisheng, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District, and Zeng Jinggai, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Ninth District, will relinquish their posts on the 13th of this month. The previous order authorizing the Special Inspector of Pacification for the First District to handle matters will be revoked starting from August, and normal operations will resume. From now on, the administration of Northern and Southern Jiangsu Province will be unified and entirely under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>First Restoration Day Celebrated Enthusiastically Citywide; Mayor Chen Delivers Earnest Speech to Municipal Government Staff</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the inaugural Restoration Day, celebrated enthusiastically by the entire populace. National flags fluttered, and prominent intersections were adorned with celebratory banners by propaganda units, creating a solemn atmosphere. In addition, slogans plastered on the walls of streets greatly boosted public morale. On the municipal government's side, to concentrate efforts, the city government relocated to the original site of the First District Public Office on Jiangxi Road yesterday. The Restoration Day memorial ceremony was held in the main auditorium. Mayor Chen, accompanied by Secretary-General Wu, attended punctually. Over two hundred officials above the rank of department head participated. The police band played music on-site, and the ceremony proceeded as prescribed. The entire assembly wished the Chairman good health. Afterwards, the Mayor delivered a speech, and the ceremony concluded after half an hour.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>Mayor Chen addressed the city government staff, saying: "Secretary-General, Directors of Bureaus and Departments, and fellow staff members, today is the first day of the true unification of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The details of the changes in Shanghai's municipal system over the past year, as well as my ideals and policies for Shanghai's administration during this year, have been documented in my article 'The Changes in Shanghai's Municipal System in the Past Year,' which I believe you have all seen in the newspapers today, so I won't go into further detail. Over the past year, we have exerted our due efforts and fulfilled our responsibilities, enabling the rapid unification of Shanghai's municipal government today. I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and to both the departing and remaining Japanese staff members. What I want to discuss today are the internal issues of the municipal government, in other words, the problems of the municipal government itself, which are also the problems of the civil servants themselves. First, since its establishment, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been incomplete in its administration. For example, the scope of its jurisdiction was limited to areas outside the two concessions. In the past, the Chinese side also had two policies to deal with the concessions. The first was to encircle the concessions, which involved building Jungong Road, now Zhongshan Road, to enclose the concessions within a certain area. This was because the concessions were constantly seeking to expand, so it was necessary to adopt a policy of 'encirclement and restriction.' The second was to isolate the concessions, which involved the construction of the city center, namely, the construction of the Jiangwan Municipal Government. At that time, industrial and commercial zones were designated in the city center, and the Qiujiang Wharf was built, with the clear intention of developing Shanghai outside the concessions and cutting off the concessions' industry and commerce through water and land transportation, thereby isolating the concessions. These two policies to deal with the concessions were well understood by anyone concerned with municipal affairs. However, the plans that accompanied these two policies inevitably had a state of distorted development and forced facts. This was unavoidable at the time, but it is now in the past. I hope that municipal government staff, after the recovery of the concessions, will view Shanghai as a whole and correct the previous notions of forced facts. We should make a natural plan for the future development of Shanghai. This is a fundamental problem for Shanghai's current and future municipal administration, and I hope everyone fully understands it.</p>
<p>Discard Preconceptions and Break Old Habits</p>
<p>Second, the Shanghai Municipal Government today includes three groups of staff: one group is the old municipal government staff, one group is the old Public Concession staff, and one group is the old French Concession staff. Each of these three groups of staff has its own experience and habits. In short, based on my observations over the past year, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages need not be said, but the common disadvantage is that preconceptions are too deep. The old municipal government staff tend to overemphasize official documents and neglect administrative efficiency, while the staff from the former two concessions tend to be too biased towards established practices and disregard Chinese laws and regulations. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, I sincerely hope that everyone will not only work together harmoniously but also discard preconceptions and break old habits. Local administration needs to be dynamic. Because it needs to be dynamic, we should strive for efficiency and reform in daily official documents. Local administration needs to have a system. Because it needs to have a system, we should strive to base everything on and unify Chinese laws and regulations. Everyone should not disregard the facts, nor should they neglect Chinese laws and regulations. We should constantly strive for progress, in order to respond to the actual situation in the locality and provide reference for the central government and local authorities. Third, I hope that everyone will strive to become good civil servants. This is the painful experience of half my life and also my hope for the future of Chinese politics. According to my experience, whether in the central government or local authorities, it is difficult to find even one good civil servant out of a hundred people. It can be said painfully that there is not even one good civil servant out of a thousand people.</p>
<p>Everyone is Absent from Everything</p>
<p>China was originally an agrarian society, and the people, due to their environment, tend to be dreamy and neglectful of reality. The civil servants I have seen are often ambitious but lack talent, greedy but unfocused. No one is willing to fulfill their responsibilities in their positions, and no one is willing to abide by their duties. Therefore, from the central government to the local authorities, everyone is absent from everything. No matter how good a country's politics are, administration must have people. Now that the people are gone, the government ceases. Even if the people remain, the government does not act. If everyone is willing to strive to be a good civil servant and knows how to be a good civil servant, not only Shanghai will have hope, but also the future of China. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is unified and the administration is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people, I hope that everyone will build on the achievements of the past year and work even harder. In this way, you can live up to the nation and the citizens. In the future, Shanghai will have endless progress, and I will share in the glory."</p>
<p>Grand Tea Party</p>
<p>To celebrate the inaugural Restoration Day and the first anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, the municipal government held a grand tea party at the Huatung Hotel on the Bund at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting officials from relevant Chinese, Japanese, and foreign authorities in the city, as well as prominent figures from all walks of life. Mayor Chen, accompanied by Secretary-General Wu, arrived punctually and, together with his subordinates, hosted the event. The directors of various municipal bureaus, including Yuan Houzhi of the Finance Bureau, Ye Xuesong of the Public Utilities Bureau, Lin Yian of the Education Bureau, Yuan Yichang of the Health Bureau, Zhang Enlin of the Public Works Bureau, Sun Mingqi of the Social Welfare Bureau, Liang Xiuyu of the Propaganda Department, Lu Ying and Su Chengde, Deputy Directors of the Police Bureau, Li Shiyu of the Judicial Department, Gu Gangwu of the Baojia Department, and Lu Qi of the Administrative Department, were present. Prominent figures from all sectors of the city, including Kai Lantong, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaozhong, Xiang Kangyuan, Pei Yunqing, Xu Liqiu, Chu Baoheng, and Chen Binsu, attended. Officials from relevant allied Japanese authorities, including Major General Kawamoto, Commander of the Shanghai Army, Commander Sasabe, Commander Kumagai of the Liaison Department, Commander Izubuchi of the Shanghai Army Reporting Department, Mr. Hino Toraichi, representative of the Naval Attaché's Office, Mr. Matsudaira, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, Mr. Yano, Consul General, and Mr. Nakata, also attended, along with representatives from various sectors, including Tatsichiro Funatsu, Yoshida, and Hosoashi. Consul General Yao Gong of Manchukuo, Consul General Fischer of Germany, prominent figures from the business community, such as Gigliotti, and representatives from other Axis countries, numbering over ten, gathered together, creating a lively atmosphere. The event lasted for two hours, and the guests and hosts parted on amicable terms.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday was the inaugural Restoration Day of our country, as well as the first anniversary of the recovery of the two Shanghai concessions. To commemorate this occasion, the municipal authorities built a memorial pavilion on the Bund Road opposite Nanjing Road. At 10:30 AM, a grand groundbreaking ceremony was held, presided over by Mayor Chen himself. Secretary-General Wu and the directors of various bureaus and departments were present, all dressed in the new national uniform to show solemnity. No fewer than two thousand people gathered to watch. Under the cooperative maintenance of order by the military, police, and law enforcement, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on time. After Mayor Chen led the ceremony in accordance with etiquette, the mayor, holding a shovel, stepped down from the chair onto the site of the memorial pavilion amid the grand strains of the Greater East Asia March. With a wave of his hand, the groundbreaking ceremony was completed. Finally, the entire assembly gathered at the site for a photograph to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Celebration Programs</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau and the Propaganda Department jointly organized the Restoration Day swimming competition, which was held grandly at the Jianghai Road Open-Air Swimming Pool at 8:00 AM yesterday. In front of the command platform were Mayor Chen, Minister of Propaganda Lin, Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government, Director Yuan of the Health Bureau, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department, other department directors, and fifteen large and small silver shields donated by various sectors. The various competitions were lively.

It was held at the Tianchan Stage at 2:00 PM yesterday. It is said that the ticket revenue from this event will be donated to the Mayor's Scholarship Fund.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Department Officially Established Yesterday; Citywide Police Administration Now Unified</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Police Department was formally established yesterday, the first Restoration Day of the Republic of China, and commenced operations immediately. A tea party was held at noon, with Director Chen personally attending and delivering an address. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>High Morale Among All Staff</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Department was officially announced yesterday morning. Director Chen and Deputy Directors Lu and Su arrived at the bureau to inspect matters. All newly appointed personnel of the various sections and offices of the bureau reported for duty. Around 11:00 AM, Director Chen received his subordinates in batches, led by Deputy Directors Lu and Su. Director Chen extended his encouragement, and all attending personnel were deeply moved and their morale was particularly high. In the afternoon, due to the Restoration Day, a half-day holiday was granted, and work was suspended to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>Director Chen's Address at Tea Party</p>
<p>Around 11:30 AM at noon, all staff members gathered in the Police Club on the seventh floor for a tea party. After the entire group paid respects to Director Chen, personnel from the First and Second Police Bureaus exchanged greetings. Director Chen then rose to deliver the following address: "Director Lu, fellow directors, and officers, today the police administration of Shanghai, like the municipal administration of Shanghai, has been declared unified. I sincerely want to express my expectations for all of you in the future.</p>
<p>First, some of you serving in the Police Department today are staff from the First Police Bureau, some are staff from the Second Police Bureau, and some are staff from the Third Police Bureau. I know that every unit must have its own history, and with the history of a unit comes the habits and views of that unit. Moreover, the First Police Bureau was reorganized from the Public Concession's patrol station, the Second Police Bureau was renamed from the original Municipal Government's Police Bureau, and the Third Police Bureau was a continuation of the former French Concession's patrol station. Each has its own different rules and different training. Today, unification and merger are announced, and in the future, perhaps everyone will have something they are not accustomed to. But although each has its own history and habits, the goal of serving the locality and protecting the people is the same. Today, Shanghai's police administration has been unified, and I hope that everyone will discard their past preconceptions, abandon their past habits, and move towards unification under Chinese laws. China has its own police laws and regulations. Everyone should act according to their past experience and follow the rules, and Shanghai's police administration will surely make significant progress. At the same time, I hope that everyone will forget past boundaries and not dwell on whether you are from the First Bureau, the Second Bureau, or the Third Bureau. You must know that today everyone belongs to the unified Police Department, and there is no longer a distinction between you and me. Secondly, everyone should know that the police are civil servants of the country, not controlled. Whether the director, the department head, or the police officer is a civil servant, even a police soldier is a civil servant. Civil servants have their identity in the country, their position in the government, and their responsibility in themselves. In the past concessions, they inevitably focused on military training and neglected the cultivation of civil servants themselves. Now that the concessions have been recovered, all of you are local officials who have responsibilities and must abide by them, not controlled. I hope everyone understands this thoroughly and makes sure that all police officers understand it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Third, there is a saying in ancient Chinese books: 'When entering a country, ask about its prohibitions; when entering a home, ask about its customs.' Prohibitions mean what should not be done, and customs mean what should be done. Prohibitions and customs can indicate whether a country is orderly, and from the expression of order, one can deduce the strength of a country. The police have both prohibitions and customs in their duties. Maintaining public order is certainly the responsibility of the police, but the police also have officers responsible for rectifying customs and guiding culture. In the past, the magistrate was considered the official closest to the people, but in today's China, no one is closer to the people than the police. From this, we can see how great our police's responsibilities and tasks are. We certainly cannot disturb the people. In addition to protecting the people, we also have the responsibility of guiding the people. For a year, I have been a police officer, but I am responsible and self-reflective. Shanghai's police administration has really not yet achieved what the average person ideally wants. Today, police administration has been declared unified. From today on, I hope everyone will be vigilant in protecting and promoting Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since the recovery of the concessions last year until today, everyone can be said to have worked tirelessly to maintain security and order. Today, at the time of police unification, I should thank everyone. I hope that everyone will work even harder after unification. You must know that securing Shanghai is securing the rear of Greater East Asia, and reviving Shanghai can also revive China. I wish you all success and look forward to your bright future."</p>
<p>Governing Police Administration of All Districts in the City</p>
<p>The bureau has unified jurisdiction over the police administration of all districts in the Shanghai Special City, including the city center (urban area) and suburban areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special City Government. In addition to directly governing the various sub-bureaus formerly under the jurisdiction of the First and Second Police Bureaus, it can also direct and supervise the heads of the Linyi Police Bureaus under the jurisdiction of the magistrates of the directly subordinate counties at any time. It also has a county police affairs office dedicated to guiding and supervising police administration in various county districts.

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Casting a Brick to Attract Jade</h3>
<p>The selection examination for our newspaper's seventh scholarship fund is underway, and the funds will be distributed as soon as the procedures are completed. However, based on the estimated number of qualified applicants and the assumed scholarship standard, the current amount of deposits received is still significantly insufficient. We earnestly rely on the enthusiastic efforts of our readers to continue contributing.</p>
<p>We recently learned that our colleagues at the Xinlie News have established a Rescue Out-of-School Youth Volunteer Team and a Popularization Team to raise funds for student loans, with remarkable results. This shows the enthusiastic public sentiment towards rescuing out-of-school youth. On the one hand, we feel that society values education and shares the great vision of cultivating the most valuable source for future revitalization. On the other hand, we deeply admire the effective appeals of our colleagues. Standing in the position of helping students, we feel even more that we have the same goal and share the same comfort.</p>
<p>However, in order to quickly reach the end point of the same goal, we are also constantly trying our best to race forward. Therefore, on the one hand, we still rely on the continuous donations of our readers. At the same time, our staff has voluntarily collected 100,000 yuan to contribute to the scholarship fund, expressing our humble intention of contributing both effort and money. If this can serve as a catalyst to attract even greater donations from all sectors, this is what our staff hopes for.</p>
