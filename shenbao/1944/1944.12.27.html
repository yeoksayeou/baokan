<h3>華南日陸海軍當局　宣布開放西江航路</h3>
<p>越南粵桂間交通綫已確立</p>
<p>大陸前綫基地二十六日中央社電　自滿洲經中國越南到達昭南之東亞動脈，由於日軍作戰之進展，業經完成，此不僅對强化大東亞內部有絕大貢獻，且此大動脈亦有助於流通物資，故華南方面日陸軍最高指揮官幷華南艦隊司令長官特共同發出布吿，開放作戰期中封鎖之西江自三水至梧州間之航路。按西江乃兩廣最靈要之水路交通，與湘江同爲培養渝方西南抗戰經濟之大動脈，此航路歸人和平區後，就渝方而言，喪失兩廣豐富之人力資源。反之，從來以廣州爲中心之狹隘和平地區，今擴大至粵桂兩省，一方日軍佔領南寗越南間公路，經日軍之積極修復及得居民眞擊協力，僅半月餘，現自越南至思樂間之百二十公里寬六米之汽車公路業已完成，預定在最近即可直通南寗，故寗越公路之完成及西江航路之開放，可謂已確立越南粵桂間之交通綫。而日軍於軍事方面利用此交通動脈，於內綫作戰上，把握絕對優勢，於經濟發展，亦有裨益，此定可促進華南人民福祉，進一步言，且可使和平地區擴張至內地。</p>
<h3>日陸軍報導部　定期招待記者</h3>

<h3>皖羅省長離蕪</h3>
<p>蚌埠二十六日中央社電　皖省長羅君强，於前日赴蕪湖主持淸鄕聯絡會議，刻已公畢，于昨晚乘車返任。</p>
<h3>重慶向何處去</h3>
<p>— 萬西白</p>
<p>英美希望由渝共的合作，强化中國的抗戰力量，所以美駐渝大使哈萊最近奉命與重慶及延安接洽，特地前往延安；這件事早爲大家所知。最近，倫敦新聞耙事報特派記者斯丹華。蓋爾達又從加爾各答發出特電，報道殊爲詳盡，此問題的經緯於是大白。蓋爾達所以特地從加爾各答發出這個電訊，即因重慶的新聞檢查非常嚴峻，不如此做便無法報道眞相。</p>
<p>綜觀蓋爾達所發的電訊所述，要之，重慶與延安的交涉已告決裂，渝方已拒絕周恩來提出的中共方面的要求即中共參加政府及軍隊統一指揮。蓋爾達的電報有一節如左：</p>
<p>「華南的軍事情勢雖然極其緊迫，但當周恩來抵達重慶時，等待了一個多星期才能晤見蔣。而且，蔣氏接見周恩來時，復出以非常高壓的態度。現在，周恩來已返延安。今後蔣氏如不改變這種態度，並要求派遣不祗是無權的形式上的代表而爲參與政府的中共代表，那末，周氏將不會再歸重慶了。</p>
<p>觀此，可知所謂國共合作實多困難。又據周恩來對蓋爾達說：</p>
<p>中共擁有約六十萬的正規軍及二百二十萬的民軍；今年九月以前，曾和日軍四九％及和建軍九〇％相抗作戰。」</p>
<p>「中共用於防衛邊區的軍隊，最多是五萬，但國民黨用來封鎖我們（中共）的兵力，卻爲四十萬，有時且達五十萬以上。國民黨在中國領土上用來封鎖中共，攻擊中共軍的兵力，總計不下七十萬。過去四年中，我們絲毫不曾從國民黨政府手裏領到武器，軍需品，醫藥用品，糧食，衣服等物。」</p>
<p>這就是中國抗日民族統一戰綫的眞相！</p>
<p>據蓋爾達的表示，如能消弭這種爭執，由重慶接受中共要求，則民族統一戰綫的抗戰力便可迅速强化起來，因此主張重慶應該讓步。</p>
<p>蓋爾達的這種意見。正足表明英美對於中國所抱的帝國主義意圖。至於蘇聯，當然也關心渝共的合作。不過，蘇聯的關心此事，祗是將它當作中國社會主義革命的一個階段而已。反之，英美之圖實現渝共合作，乃是將它作爲保持並强化其在東亞的帝國主義的支配地位，使中國民衆完全做其奴隸的一種手段。蘇聯與英美的目的，　觀似乎一致，然其意圖則根本相異。這種齟齲，不僅在中國，即在世界政治上，也呈露出來。試看義大利，法蘭西，比利時，以及希臘，無不如此。再回顧一下英美與蘇聯的所謂對德聯合戰綫，也可明白。</p>
<p>當然，蔣氏也充分知道和延安合作對於張化抗戰力可有效果，但他同時也明白由周恩來提出的形式上的合作可使其政權的基礎崩裂。而隱藏在這個問題背後的英美及蘇聯的意圖，想必也是知道的。可是祗要他依然繼續無謂的對日抗戰，則其當面的矛盾將日益深刻，其　定自己的危懼，至於英美，雖然爲了遂行對日戰爭，圖謀盡量利用中國的人民及土地起見，慫恿渝共合作，但他們也不是不知道，此事結果會使他們在東亞的帝國主義性支配地位趨向崩潰。他們之所以不得不行此冒險，其原因不是爲了他們邪惡的戰爭目的嗎？這點看得最穿的，便是延安的報導者們。他們正想借重英美對渝的壓力，一步一步向中國社會主義革命的目標挺進，此在蔣氏，誠爲四面楚歌了，雖然曾經爲了「中國的命這」盤算遠，但是，　　觀念如以繼續對日抗戰爲前提，則將徒然盤圈子而已。而且將慄然於本身及共政權所臨的毀滅的深淵吧。</p>
<p>從這點而言，他接見周恩來時所有的高　的不客氣態度，是可同情的。</p>
<p>蔣氏祇有一條路可以衝出這個四面楚歌的環境。此路已由日本明明白白的指出來了。它是最便捷的路。今日，對於蔣氏最爲必要的，就是東方人的深刻而冷行「生命之飛躍」的勇氣。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰局勢</h3>
<p>這幾天德國對反軸心軍的作戰，甚爲劇烈，尤其西綫比利時盧森堡的邊境，德國反攻更較得利，歐洲戰局頗有改變的趨勢。</p>
<p>當今年夏秋，軸心國在各戰綫變更戰略，轉移防綫之際，不少近視者曾把軸心陣營的力量，作過低的估計，反軸心國方面的樂觀主義者，也竟妄想於短期內，遲到本年年底，把歐戰結事，然而局勢的發展，却並不如此。</p>
<p>實際上軸心陣營的力量，始終堅强的。就軍事方面說，自夏秋以來至現在，軸心各國一直保持着强大的軍隊。訓練純熟的精壯部隊配以日新月異的新銳武器，其戰鬥力在幾個月來已充分證明。有人又曾懷疑德國的經濟力量，以爲有重蹈上决歐戰覆轍的可能，但這次顯然不此上决。於這次戰爭未爆發之前，德國早已料定戰事的不可避免，所以在物力方面事前已儲備得相當充足。戰事旣發生，德國抱定了擊滅敵人的決心，於是又加倍動員，增强生產，供應非常充足。接着，德國又從軸心陣營的其他各國及佔領地獲得了不少的物資，存量更見充裕。</p>
<p>政治方面，德國雖有少數的反叛事件，事實上不僅並未動搖德國內部的團結，且反而澄淸德國的政治氣氛，而得眞正造成舉國一致澈底滅敵的精神。所以反叛事件肅淸以後，德國政治在更鞏固更明朗的基礎之下，應付戰局，極見順手。</p>
<p>此外，歐洲軸心國間團結問題，所有少數小國中的一部份叛逆分子，受反軸心國的蠱惑，但大多數依然是忠於軸心的。觀於目前德義聯軍仍在義大利戰綫駢肩作戰，擊退英美軍隊，德洪聯軍仍在洪牙利戰綫合作無間，抗禦蘇聯的進攻等等，可以想見。</p>
<p>反之，反軸心陣營中，以美國爲首，雖自恃物資雄厚，但勞師遠征，兵力物力的供應接濟等，因戰事愈久，也必愈趨困難。物資雖多，可是消耗更大，生產到底有限，消耗却屬無窮。同時，英美諸國的國民，多是享樂慣的，不像日德諸國國民的能够刻苦耐勞，戰事的持久，必會使英美國民愈益難以忍受更大的痛苦，而戰事的渺茫，將使他們前方士氣及後方國民的精神，越發頽喪。影饗作戰與生產，自極巨大。這也是反軸心國的苦悶之一。</p>
<p>又反軸心陣營的內部矛盾，現在隨着戰事的發展，也日見露骨。英美和蘇聯間的貌合神離由來已久。目前對德戰爭，他們雙方都希望另一方多消耗些，而自己則少出力，這顯然足以減低他們聯合作戰的力量。同時，英美不願蘇聯在歐洲勢力太大，蘇聯也不顧英美再控制歐洲。因猜忌之故，遂影響了他們的合作。早先的芬蘭問題，以前的波蘭問題，稍前的羅馬尼亞保加利亞問題，以至最近的希臘問題和法國問題等，英美和蘇聯間的矛盾，表露得很明顯。</p>
<p>再在英美之間，他們也有若干對立，英國仍想制霸歐洲，而美國則想進而領袖歐洲，各藏心事。這在法國問題上，表現得尤爲顯著。法國特戈爾政權便即利用了英美之間的矛盾及英美和蘇聯之間的矛盾，合縱連橫，企岡重振已經崩潰了的法國地位。目前圍繞於蘇法公的的陰沉空氣，即是他們多角矛盾表面化的一端。反軸心陣營的裂痕，實有日趨尖說化的可能。</p>
<p>歐洲戰局的裂痕，實有日趨尖銳化的可能。</p>
<p>歐洲戰局的前途如何發展，觀以上所述，可以推知了。</p>

<h3>比境美軍增援　發動解救攻勢　德傘兵降落比法邊境</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：比利時東南部冬季大戰之第九日，反軸心軍又大事增援。當備軍攻勢發動以前，艾森　華已將其全部後備兵力，調至東琛及薩爾兩處，企圖突入科隆及薩爾區，今料該兩處之敵軍，已有大部份被調回矣。昨日德軍戰報已稱，西北萊因區及薩爾·帕拉丁納區之敵軍壓力已大減，艾森霍華之突破計劃當巳失敗。敵方自亞琛及薩爾方面撤回之兵力，正從事攻擊德軍突入部之南北兩側，德方早已料及此等計劃，故已預爲佈置應付辦法。德軍右翼埃爾森蓬（Elsenborn）與斯達維洛（Stavelot在瑪爾米台西北）間，美軍已不得不發動解救攻勢，至於南翼之美軍則尙在猛烈反攻。</p>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日陸軍航空本部航務課長飯島正義大佐，前於大東亞戰爭勃發時，曾視察目下德軍展開新攻勢作戰之戰場附近，特就西綫現況發表談話如次：本人當大東亞戰爭勃發之際，曾視察目下備軍展開新攻勢作戰之場地帶。盟邦德國軍隊目下進擊作戰中之亞登納森林及其附近一帶，極爲平坦，眞可謂和平樂土，即因盧森堡是如此緩衝綿亙三國，故於展開西綫作戰，能成爲極理想的地方。德軍此次能發動如此大規模之攻勢作戰者，第一，當推最近飛機之大批製造成功，尤以噴射式飛機之完成，重爲促成此次大攻勢之最大原因。德國爲此大工塲，均以從來同樣能力，幷盡力簡便手續，以至生產機數達平時之三倍或四倍以上，但生產機之速度，較從來飛機發動機則超達數音，故於比種航空幾之掩護下，四十五噸級之大戰車得任意前進，加之强力之國民擲彈兵，到處潰滅敵勝車隊，故此種久受納粹黨敎育之靑年，實可謂空中特別攻擊隊。因德軍過去數個月之沉默，甚至有以爲德國已行弱化者，蓋此時期爲德國工塲轉移或地下疏散時期，但目下德國各工塲之轉移均吿完成，且照常生產。加以參加比戰綫者，均爲慣於寒冷之北德意志人，故絕不稍因寒冷而對作戰上蒙受阻礙。</p>

<h3>「安得儲鈔兩千萬　作育一般清寒學子成英才」</h3>
<p>古人詩有云：「安得廣廈千萬間，大庇天下寒士盡歡顏，」這原是藹然仁者之言；然而這樣的仁，是狹義的仁，是消極的仁。譬如你果然有了千萬間的廣廈，把天下寒士一批批的收容起來，讓他們飽食終日，無所用心，試問對於國家對於社會有何益處？不過是一個高等　民收容所罷了。那麼同樣的行仁，應該怎樣的做法，纔不是狹義的仁，纔不是消極的仁呢？最好的做法，莫如捐輸本報讀者助學金，無論多多少少，決沒有一個錢擲於虛牝；大家盡一分力，就間接造就一個英材，於國家於社會都有莫大的益處。所以我在這裏要把古人的那兩句詩改一下子：「安得儲鈔兩千萬，作育一般清寒學子成英材？」</p>

<h3>The Eighty-Sixth Session of the Japanese Diet Solemnly Opens; Both Houses Scheduled for Separate Plenary Sessions Today</h3>
<p>Imperial Rescript</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - His Majesty the Emperor of Japan issued the following Imperial Rescript at the opening ceremony of the Eighty-Sixth Session of the Diet on the 26th: "As I convene the Imperial Diet, I inform you, members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, that My officers and men of the Army and Navy are fighting with determination, and My one hundred million subjects are striving and exerting themselves, enhancing our war power through production and overcoming all difficulties year after year. To this day, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is progressing daily, and our alliances with friendly nations are becoming increasingly stronger, which I deeply appreciate. Now that the war situation is becoming increasingly critical, it is truly the time for one hundred million hearts to unite and devote all their efforts to crushing the enemy. I trust in the loyalty, courage, and martial spirit of My subjects and deeply hope for the speedy completion of the war's objectives. I have ordered the Ministers of State to submit the budget proposal for the Showa 20th year and temporary military expenses, along with various legal bills, to the Imperial Diet. You shall unite your will with Mine, deliberate harmoniously, and exhaust your duties of cooperation."</p>

<h3>Fighting Continues Near Hechi</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing: The Chongqing Military Council announced on the 25th that fighting continues near Hechi in northwestern Guangxi Province. Since the arrival of reinforcements, the Japanese army in the city has launched counterattacks against various Chongqing military positions.</p>
<h3>Ten Warriors of the Yasukuni Special Attack Force Promoted</h3>
<p>Announced by the Japanese Army Ministry</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Lieutenant Demaru, commander of the Yasukuni Flight Corps of the Japanese Special Attack Force, and his ten warriors, attacked enemy ships near Leyte Gulf on November 24th, 26th, and 29th, sinking or damaging a total of nine ships using suicide tactics, achieving remarkable results. Each of the warriors has been rewarded for their contributions and promoted accordingly. The announcement was made by the Japanese Army Ministry on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Authorities in South China Announce Opening of the West River Waterway</h3>
<p>Transportation Line Between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi Established</p>
<p>Continental Front Base, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The East Asian artery, which runs from Manchuria through China and Vietnam to Syonan, has been completed due to the progress of Japanese military operations. This not only makes a significant contribution to strengthening the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere internally, but this artery also helps to facilitate the flow of goods. Therefore, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in South China and the commander of the South China Fleet have jointly issued an announcement opening the waterway on the West River from Sanshui to Wuzhou, which had been closed during the operations. The West River is the most important waterway in Guangdong and Guangxi, and, along with the Xiang River, it is a major artery for nurturing the southwestern economy of the Chongqing side. After this waterway returns to the peace zone, from the Chongqing side's perspective, it loses the abundant human resources of Guangdong and Guangxi. Conversely, the narrow peace area, which has been centered on Guangzhou, is now expanding to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On one hand, the Japanese army occupied the highway between Nanning and Vietnam. Through active repairs by the Japanese army and genuine cooperation from the residents, the 120-kilometer-long, 6-meter-wide automobile highway from Vietnam to Sile has been completed in just over half a month and is expected to directly connect to Nanning in the near future. Therefore, the completion of the Nanning-Vietnam highway and the opening of the West River waterway can be said to have established the transportation line between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Furthermore, the Japanese army is using this transportation artery for military purposes, gaining an absolute advantage in internal operations, and it is also beneficial to economic development. This will surely promote the well-being of the people in South China, and further, it can expand the peace zone to the interior.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Press Department Regularly Invites Reporters</h3>

<h3>Where is Chongqing Going?</h3>
<p>— Wan Xibai</p>
<p>Britain and the United States hope that cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists will strengthen China's war effort. Therefore, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, was recently ordered to contact both Chongqing and Yan'an and made a special trip to Yan'an. This matter has long been known to everyone. Recently, Stanley W. Gellard, a special correspondent for the London News Chronicle, also sent a detailed telegram from Calcutta, making the ins and outs of this issue clear. Gellard specifically sent this telegram from Calcutta because news censorship in Chongqing is very strict, and it would not be possible to report the truth otherwise.</p>
<p>In summary, according to the telegram sent by Gellard, negotiations between Chongqing and Yan'an have broken down, and the Chongqing side has rejected the demands of the Communist side presented by Zhou Enlai, namely the participation of the Communists in the government and the unified command of the armed forces. One section of Gellard's telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Although the military situation in South China is extremely urgent, Zhou Enlai had to wait for more than a week to meet Chiang when he arrived in Chongqing. Moreover, Chiang Kai-shek met Zhou Enlai with a very high-handed attitude. Now, Zhou Enlai has returned to Yan'an. Unless Chiang changes this attitude and requests the dispatch of not just nominal representatives without power but Communist representatives to participate in the government, Zhou will not return to Chongqing again."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists is very difficult. Zhou Enlai also told Gellard:</p>
<p>"The CCP has approximately 600,000 regular troops and 2.2 million militia. Before September of this year, they fought against 49% of the Japanese army and 90% of the puppet army."</p>
<p>"The troops used by the CCP to defend the border regions are, at most, 50,000, but the Kuomintang uses 400,000 troops to blockade us (the CCP), and sometimes even more than 500,000. The total number of troops used by the Kuomintang on Chinese territory to blockade the CCP and attack the Communist army is no less than 700,000. In the past four years, we have not received any weapons, military supplies, medical supplies, food, or clothing from the Kuomintang government."</p>
<p>This is the truth about China's anti-Japanese national united front!</p>
<p>According to Gellard, if this dispute can be resolved and Chongqing accepts the CCP's demands, the war effort of the national united front can be rapidly strengthened. Therefore, he advocates that Chongqing should make concessions.</p>
<p>Gellard's opinion fully demonstrates the imperialist intentions of Britain and the United States towards China. As for the Soviet Union, it is naturally concerned about the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists. However, the Soviet Union's concern for this matter is only to regard it as a stage of the Chinese socialist revolution. On the contrary, the aim of Britain and the United States in realizing the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists is to use it as a means to maintain and strengthen their imperialist dominance in East Asia and to completely enslave the Chinese people. The goals of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States seem consistent, but their intentions are fundamentally different. This discord is not only evident in China but also in world politics. Look at Italy, France, Belgium, and Greece; they are all like this. Looking back at the so-called Allied Front against Germany between Britain and the United States, it can also be understood.</p>
<p>Of course, Chiang Kai-shek is fully aware that cooperation with Yan'an can have an effect on expanding the war effort, but he also understands that the formal cooperation proposed by Zhou Enlai can cause the foundation of his regime to collapse. And the intentions of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union hidden behind this issue are probably also known to him. However, as long as he continues the futile war of resistance against Japan, the contradictions he faces will become increasingly profound, and his own anxieties will increase. As for Britain and the United States, although they are trying to make full use of the Chinese people and land in order to carry out the war against Japan, they are not unaware that this will lead to the collapse of their imperialist dominance in East Asia. The reason why they have to take this risk is for their evil war aims, is it not? Those in Yan'an understand this the most clearly. They are trying to take advantage of the pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Chongqing to advance towards the goal of Chinese socialist revolution step by step. For Chiang Kai-shek, this is truly being besieged on all sides. Although he once planned far ahead for the "destiny of China," if these considerations continue to be based on the premise of resisting Japan, they will only go around in circles. And he will tremble at the abyss of destruction that his own regime is facing.</p>
<p>From this point of view, his high-handed and discourteous attitude when meeting Zhou Enlai is understandable.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek has only one way to break out of this situation of being besieged on all sides. This path has been clearly pointed out by Japan. It is the most convenient path. Today, what is most necessary for Chiang Kai-shek is the profound and calmly executed courage of Easterners to make a "leap of life."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The European War Situation</h3>
<p>In recent days, Germany's operations against the anti-Axis forces have been very fierce, especially on the western front, along the border between Belgium and Luxembourg, where the German counter-offensive has been more successful, and the trend of the European war has changed somewhat.</p>
<p>When the Axis powers changed their strategy and shifted their defense lines on various fronts during the summer and autumn of this year, many short-sighted people underestimated the strength of the Axis camp, and optimists on the anti-Axis side even fantasized about concluding the European war in the short term, perhaps by the end of this year. However, the development of the situation is not like that.</p>
<p>In fact, the strength of the Axis camp has always been strong. From a military perspective, since the summer and autumn to the present, the Axis countries have maintained strong armies. The combat effectiveness of well-trained elite troops equipped with increasingly advanced new weapons has been fully demonstrated in recent months. Some have also doubted Germany's economic strength, believing that it might repeat the mistakes of the previous European war, but this time is clearly different. Before the outbreak of this war, Germany had already anticipated the inevitability of the war, so it had made considerable preparations in terms of material resources in advance. After the war broke out, Germany embraced the determination to destroy the enemy, and then doubled its mobilization, increased production, and provided very abundant supplies. Next, Germany obtained a lot of materials from other countries in the Axis camp and occupied territories, making its reserves even more abundant.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, although Germany has had a few rebellious incidents, in fact, they have not only failed to shake the internal unity of Germany, but have instead clarified the German political atmosphere and truly created a national spirit of unanimous and thorough destruction of the enemy. Therefore, after the rebellious incidents were quelled, German politics, on a more solid and clear foundation, has handled the war situation with great ease.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the issue of unity among the European Axis countries, some rebellious elements in a few small countries have been seduced by the anti-Axis countries, but the majority remain loyal to the Axis. Judging from the fact that the German-Italian joint forces are still fighting side by side on the Italian front, repelling the Anglo-American forces, and the German-Hungarian joint forces are still cooperating seamlessly on the Hungarian front, resisting the Soviet offensive, it can be imagined.</p>
<p>On the contrary, in the anti-Axis camp, with the United States at its head, although it relies on its abundant material resources, its long-distance expeditions and the supply and support of troops and materials will inevitably become increasingly difficult as the war drags on. Although there are many materials, the consumption is even greater. Production is ultimately limited, but consumption is infinite. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States are mostly accustomed to enjoying life and are not as able to endure hardship as the people of Japan and Germany. The prolongation of the war will inevitably make it increasingly difficult for the British and American people to endure greater suffering, and the uncertainty of the war will make the morale of the troops at the front and the spirit of the people at the rear increasingly demoralized. The impact on combat and production is extremely significant. This is also one of the anxieties of the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<p>Moreover, the internal contradictions of the anti-Axis camp are becoming increasingly apparent as the war develops. The apparent harmony but real discord between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has long been in existence. Currently, in the war against Germany, both sides hope that the other side will expend more resources while expending less themselves, which is clearly enough to reduce the strength of their joint operations. At the same time, Britain and the United States do not want the Soviet Union to have too much influence in Europe, and the Soviet Union does not want Britain and the United States to control Europe again. Because of suspicion, their cooperation has been affected. The earlier Finnish issue, the previous Polish issue, the slightly earlier Romanian and Bulgarian issues, and the recent Greek and French issues, the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have been clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, between Britain and the United States, they also have some conflicts. Britain still wants to dominate Europe, while the United States wants to go further and lead Europe, each harboring their own intentions. This is particularly evident in the French issue. The French Petain regime is taking advantage of the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, forming alliances to attempt to revive the already collapsed status of France. The somber atmosphere surrounding the Soviet-French communique is one manifestation of their multifaceted contradictions. The cracks in the anti-Axis camp may become increasingly acute.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, the future development of the European war situation can be inferred.</p>

<h3>American Troop Reinforcements in Belgium Initiate Rescue Offensive; German Paratroopers Land on Belgian-French Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency: On the ninth day of the winter battle in southeastern Belgium, the anti-Axis forces have greatly reinforced their troops. Prior to the launch of the reserve force offensive, Eisenhower had already moved his entire reserve force to Aachen and Saar, attempting to break through Cologne and the Saar region. It is now expected that a large portion of the enemy forces in these two areas have been redeployed. Yesterday's German war report stated that enemy pressure in the northwestern Rhineland and Saar-Palatinate regions had been greatly reduced, and Eisenhower's breakthrough plan had failed. Enemy forces withdrawn from the Aachen and Saar fronts are now attacking the north and south flanks of the German penetration forces. The German side had anticipated these plans and made preparations to respond. On the German right flank, between Elsenborn and Stavelot (northwest of Malmedy), American forces have been forced to launch a rescue offensive, while the American forces on the southern flank are still fiercely counterattacking.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - German News Agency: According to the Supreme Command of the Invasion Forces in Europe, German paratroopers have landed in Beauraing, a location on the Belgian-French border, three miles southeast of Givet.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to frontline intelligence reports, German forces in eastern Holland have successfully crossed the Meuse River at several locations.</p>
<p>Colonel Iida Discusses the Situation on the Western Front</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Colonel Masayoshi Iida, head of the Air Affairs Section of the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters, who had inspected the area near the battlefield where the German forces are currently launching a new offensive at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, made the following remarks on the current situation on the Western Front: When the Greater East Asia War broke out, I inspected the area where the reserve forces are currently launching a new offensive. The Ardennes Forest and its surrounding areas, where the Allied German forces are currently conducting their offensive operations, are extremely flat and can truly be described as a peaceful paradise. Because Luxembourg serves as such a buffer zone between three countries, it can be an ideal place to launch operations on the Western Front. The reasons why the German army was able to launch such a large-scale offensive operation this time are: firstly, the recent successful mass production of aircraft, especially the completion of jet aircraft, which was the biggest reason for promoting this large-scale offensive. Germany, as a large factory for this purpose, has been using the same capabilities as before and simplifying procedures as much as possible, resulting in the production of three or four times more aircraft than usual. However, the speed of the produced aircraft is several times faster than that of conventional aircraft engines. Therefore, under the cover of this type of aircraft, 45-ton tanks can advance at will. In addition, the strong National Grenadiers are destroying enemy vehicle convoys everywhere. Therefore, these young people, who have been educated by the Nazi Party for a long time, can truly be called the air special attack force. Because of the German army's silence in the past few months, some have even thought that Germany has weakened. However, this period was a period of relocation or underground dispersal of German factories. However, at present, the relocation of German factories has been completed, and they are producing as usual. In addition, those participating in the Belgian front are all North Germans who are accustomed to the cold. Therefore, they will not be hindered in their operations by the cold in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Germany, 87 Shot Down</h3>

<h3>Key Points for Air Raid Precautions in Public Places; Each Police Precinct Responsible for Enforcement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in accordance with the Municipal Government's regulations regarding air raid precautions in various public entertainment venues within the city, has ordered all such venues to strictly comply with the regulations and has instructed each precinct to be responsible for enforcement. The key points for attention are as follows:</p>
<p>Filing of Air Raid Precaution Status</p>
<p>(1) According to Announcement No. 12110 of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Group 1, Document Hu-zi, dated November 25, 1944, each business venue should fill out two copies of the Air Raid Precaution Status form with the following information. One copy will be kept on file by the precinct in charge, and one copy will be submitted to the Police Defense Division (however, if there are any changes in the information recorded, it should be handled according to the previous item at any time). 1. Type of business. 2. Location and name of the business venue. 3. Address, occupation, name, and age of the operator. 4. Area of the business venue (must be attached with a simplified map). 5. Type and style of the building. 6. Current status of the air defense equipment listed in Article 1 of the announcement and the names, ages, and organization chart of the personnel of each team and responsible person of the special air defense corps listed in Article 3 of the announcement. (2) The alarm transmission equipment must be able to quickly transmit to all parts of the venue simultaneously with the issuance of the alarm. (3) Considering whether the building is sturdy, the most sturdy and safe place must be selected to construct shelter facilities. However, business venues that have always been designated as public shelters should be completely removed at this time, and consideration should be given to constructing their own shelter venues. (4) Emergency exits must be utilized as they have always been. Do not place chairs or stack objects in the passageways or entrances and exits. Strict supervision must be carried out at all times. However, situations where there are no emergency exit facilities or where there are emergency exit facilities but they are inadequate should be reported. (5) Rescue materials, defense equipment, and materials must be prepared quickly and completely. (6) In addition to the water supply, appropriate containers should be provided for fire-fighting water, and they should be filled with water at all times.</p>
<p>Air Raid Alert</p>
<p>Absolutely Prohibited Performances</p>
<p>(7) When an air raid alert is issued, performances should be absolutely prohibited. Therefore, the sale of admission tickets should be strictly prohibited during that time. (8) When a preliminary alert is issued, although the policy of allowing the opening of venues is adopted, if a preliminary alert is encountered during the performance, the issuer should temporarily stop the music and performance. After the planned measures have been completed, the operator should consult the police precinct in charge to determine whether the performance can continue. Therefore, the precinct chief or the police defense director should first request instructions from the Air Defense Headquarters regarding the air defense status. (9) If there is no other suitable place besides using the business venue as a shelter, a report should be filled out, and the precinct chief's opinion should be attached and reported to the Director of the Police Defense Division. (10) Even if the time when the air raid alert is lifted exceeds the prescribed opening time, those who have sought shelter should continue to seek shelter (however, this does not apply if it is the person seeking shelter's own intention, or if the shelter has been lifted by the precinct chief according to the situation, or if it has been permitted by the precinct chief). (11) The regulations regarding admission must be strictly based on the announcement and displayed in several places within the venue. In addition, detailed matters other than those in the announcement should be reported with the precinct chief's opinion and instructions should be requested. (12) Hotel restaurants, teahouses, or other operators who concurrently manage all or part of their business venues with the various items listed in Article 1 of the announcement should base their operations on the fact that the parts directly or indirectly related to their business are within the scope of air raid precaution enforcement, and this point should not be omitted. (13) If inadequate facilities are deemed necessary to be renovated, all personnel of the Air Defense Headquarters should be required to conduct a joint inspection. (14) Opinions on punishing violators should be submitted to the Director of the Police Defense Division for referral to the Director of the Police Bureau. (15) Management must be unified, and a full-time person should conduct regular inspections more than twice a month and report truthfully.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank Loans 20 Million Yuan; Used for Production Increase Enterprises; Not Used for Interbank Lending</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank has loaned 20 million yuan to twelve banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Real Estate Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial Bank, and New China Trust &amp; Savings Bank, to regulate their funds for operations. This loan agreement was signed and established last week. Central News Agency reporters interviewed the respective banks to inquire about the use of this loan. It was reported that, in view of the increasing shortage of materials and rising prices, the government authorities are actively advocating increased production. Powerful figures in the financial world, in order to assist the government in promoting increased production and smoothing the source of materials, so as to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, originally intended to consult with major banking institutions to plan the issuance of appropriation notes to increase chips and handle investment and production enterprises. Later, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance decided that the Central Reserve Bank would lend 20 million yuan of funds for distribution to various banks for use, because the issuance of appropriation notes is related to the unification of the currency system. Therefore, this loan is not used for interbank lending, but absolutely used to increase production and handle material exchange enterprises to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Tree Wood Prices Soar; Strictly Order to Comply with Price Limits; Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of tree wood has soared. According to regulations, each load of pine wood is sold for more than 4,000 yuan. However, the black market price of each load of various wood stores is as high as 7,000 yuan. The relevant authorities believe that this illegal price increase should be thoroughly investigated and suppressed. Therefore, in recent days, they have separately summoned representatives from the Central Market and the Tree Wood Industry Association to discuss ways to suppress wood prices. It is reported that in the future, the sale of tree wood will be in accordance with the prescribed price limits, and no arbitrary increase will be allowed.</p>
<p>Hoping for Early Sales of Household Coal Briquettes</p>
<p>The sixth phase of household coal briquettes in this city has already been sold extensively throughout the city. Up to now, there is still no definite news about the allocation of the seventh phase of household coal briquettes. At a time when fuel prices are soaring, the people need it urgently and can only rely on the black market to meet their urgent needs. However, the coal briquettes in the black market are mostly difficult to burn because the quality is extremely poor. Therefore, the entire public deeply hopes that household coal briquettes can be allocated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>"How Can We Accumulate Twenty Million in Banknotes to Cultivate Ordinary Impoverished Students into Talents?"</h3>
<p>An ancient poem says: "How can we obtain tens of millions of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy?" This was originally a kind and benevolent statement. However, this kind of benevolence is narrow and passive. For example, if you really had tens of millions of mansions, and you housed the poor scholars of the world in batches, allowing them to eat their fill all day long without doing anything, what good would that do for the country or society? It would only be a high-class public shelter. So, what should be done in the same spirit of benevolence to avoid being narrow and passive? The best way is to donate to the readers' scholarship fund of this newspaper. No matter how much or how little, not a single penny will be wasted. Everyone contributes a little, indirectly cultivating a talent, which is of great benefit to the country and society. Therefore, I want to change the ancient poem here: "How can we accumulate twenty million in banknotes to cultivate ordinary impoverished students into talents?"</p>
<p>Shanghai New China Middle School</p>
<p>Collective Donation</p>
<p>A letter from the students of Industrial Class 3 of Shanghai New China Middle School who are receiving assistance states: "We are students who are receiving assistance, and because we have not yet been able to repay the kindness of the benefactors in society with any effort, we often feel a sense of gratitude that cannot be expressed and a mixture of shame and fear. After reading the letter of initial donation from Nanyang Middle School, our motivation was inspired. With the support of our Industrial Class 3 classmates, we formed a team called the 'Shanghai New China Middle School Industrial Class 34 Team' and donated 20,300 yuan. Although the amount is small, it is a token of our sincere intentions. Moreover, if everyone in each school and at each grade level works together to solicit donations, then small amounts will accumulate into large amounts, and the predetermined goal will certainly be achieved as scheduled."</p>

Wang and Zhou insisted on not accepting them, so they initiated a charity sale on the spot, and the proceeds were divided between the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers as scholarship funds. The guests enthusiastically bid, and a total of 28,200 yuan was raised. We are now sending you a list of donors and half of the amount, totaling 14,100 yuan, which we ask you to include under the scholarship fund item and we hope that the names of the donors will be jointly announced as a token of appreciation.</p>
