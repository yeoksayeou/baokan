<h3 id="c1">衛生 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本市衛生局以本月一日至七日為衛生宣傳周，並舉行衛生運動大會及衛生展覽會。開幕之日，儀式隆重，情況熱烈。同時本市第一區公務處亦表示將嚴厲取締達章建鞏及設法減除滬西水患。雙方詳請，已分見五月三十一日至六月二日本報本埠新聞攔。際此推進衛生工作展開活動之時，謹略供芻言，以備採納。</p>
<p>自去年八月一日以來，市民對於市政府整個機構寄以莫大之期待，因此當時會有熱烈之與論，連篇櫐牘，或則建議大綱，或則商榨細則，以期市政統一之後在相當時期　有長足之進展而頓改舊觀。去年八月十四日及十二月十四日本報社評中所提及者，今日畢竟有一部份實現之動機，尤以兩機關各就其崗位，努力於其主管之事務，此足使一般市民感覺無限欣慰而願竭誠擁護者。</p>
<p>民須使由之，則相習成風而易推進，故宣傳工作以其含有誘導啟迪之作用，斷不可廢。惟為政亦不在多言，貴在實踐，尤宜着眼於有效之方法。見其事實上所呈露之缺陷，當先深究其根源之所隱伏。以政府之力量斬其根塞其源，則面目必煥然一新，而於短期間內克達預期之目的，較之責成市民各自作不澈底之努力，必能事半而功倍。例如目前各里弄垃圾桶之四週狼藉以及桶壁洞穿桶蓋無着，甚至建築里弄時，根本未計及放置垃圾桶之地位，甲戶推之置於乙戶之門前，乙戶又移之置於丙戶之窗下，因此而引起口角者亦不一而足。此雖小問題，但亦應有辦法之規定，而使垃圾桶之置辦與保管確有負其責者，違反規定之辦法必受懸示之制裁，或可較甲長個人之蟯論易收成效。此僅一例，餘可類推。</p>
<p>其有非市民力之所能及，而當局可朝發令而夕收效者，尤不宜以其瑣細不屑為而忽之。例如時未薄暮而大街通衢之上已傾卸垃圾，甘已晌午而垃圾車正在春鍾，灰塵飛揚，臭氣四溢，糞車工作之時間亦復如此。此類情形，若經規定鐘點，由主管部分嚴格執行，自可立即消滅。至若積垢經日無人過問，則其玩忽職務之愆，尤宜早加懲戒。</p>
<p>與衛生之請求有密切之關係者，尙有居住問題用水及燃料問題。一家五六口侷處一斗室，平時空氣不足，病時無法隔離。水火具有去垢殺菌之功，若每人所用之量不够標準，或價格過昻無力消費，則雖深悉衛生之重要，亦必有知易行難之感。此中微妙，亦惟有當局者能加以探討糾正，絕非市民所能單獨努力者。</p>
<p>由宣傳衛生之日起，至達成市民各個健康目的之日止，有待於緊急之措置者正多，願我當局在本週之後從長計議而加以實施，是市民在慶幸追隨之餘所敢希望者。</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電　大本營於四日下午一時五十分發表：敵有力部隊於五月中旬在新幾內亞特爾河河口附近登陸，該地日軍即與由活蘭地亞附近轉進之日軍相連絡，自五月二十七日以來，對特爾河口登陸之敵軍反覆强襲，將其大部擊潰，現正繼續攻擊殘敵中。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　敵軍於四月二十二日在活蘭地亞·阿伊答伯附近登陸，因受日軍之阻擊，致不能形成其掠奪之戰略。據聞敵軍以活蘭地亞阿伊答伯為中心，向西部新幾內亞各地試行登陸，五月十七日晨敵軍約一師團携有坦克車裝甲車六七十輛及卡車五十輛，于活蘭地亞西方二百公里特爾河西岸地區，趕築登陸橋頭堡，該地附近之日軍當即與活蘭地亞附近轉進之日軍協力，犢極準備攻擊敵軍。至二十七日晨遂展開擊滅戰，首先急襲特爾河河口東方十二公里特姆附近之敵軍使受重創，敵棄屍三百具，特姆附近之敵軍約八百人遭日軍猛攻，即　於混亂狀態，遂分乘舟艇十艘向海面之瓦庫迭島逃去。另一部殘敵則遁入附近之部落內，日軍刻正追擊敗敵中。三十日另一日軍部隊猛襲據守特爾河東方八公里之阿拉勒村及特爾河左岸地區之敵軍主力，衝破敵戰車陣及地雷地帶，直衝敵軍陣地，速續作肉搏戰，終於二日晨將諸地附近之敵軍主力驅至水濱，並澈底摧毀之，於是欲切斷新幾內亞日軍戰綫而行登陸之敵軍有力部隊，除一部逃往瓦庫迭烏外，大部均在水濱犧牲，敵軍作為蛙跳作戰根據地之一橋頭堡亦被撲滅，刻日軍正繼續掃蕩殘敵中。新幾內亞戰綫之日軍部隊，於四月十六日至五月上旬，曾在埃塔貝南方五十公里之烏勞附近，殲滅敵軍約一個聯隊，五月三日更在埃塔貝東方三十公里之亞卡墨爾，殲滅敵軍登陸部隊，刻正準備攻擊埃塔貝。日軍將兵以迭奏凱歌，意氣倍極昻揚，乃繼續向在必阿克為登陸之敵軍部隊，展開攻勢，進展亦極順利。</p>
<h3 id="c3">華北正努力增產　協助大東亞戰爭　最高經濟顧問小倉氏發表談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏，於視察華北地方經濟歸來後，特於三日下午四時半，接見中國方面記者，發表視察華北經濟情况，暨此行觀感之談話，茲錄誌於後：本人於五月十九日前往華北，六月一日返京，旅程計共十二日。其間廿一日至廿三日在天津，餘日悉在北平。回想去歲九月間，鄙人以日人資格，參加蒙疆考察團，途經北平，惟未能多作勾留，詳細考察。此次得有機會，詳細調查，視察華北各地經濟狀况，並得晤華北經濟界文化界知名之士，深感此行甚具重大意義。華北與華中之經濟情形，或因各地情况不同，故亦不能一概觀察。然華北亦係中國國圖，　屬國府治下，就整個經濟施策而言，自應採取同一步調。目前中國最大問題，厥在安定民生，對人力資源及物質資源，得以活用，俾期貢獻於大東亞戰爭。此次鄙人見華北之煤鐵等礦藏豐富，於戰爭貢獻甚大，故非常感覺愉快。但欲使華北能儘量發掘地下資源，必有待於華中方面之食糧增產，俾可接濟華北，完成此種使命，此點乃鄙人之意見。今年華北一切情况，均甚順利。河南作戰及農業增產，其表現之成績，至屬良好。同時華北之有識人士，對大東亞戰爭之遂仃，已獲得深切瞭解，即平民亦然，此實為鄙人之最感興奮者。因現時處於戰爭期間，故有八路軍之騷擾，而於治安施策不無略受影饗。促以軍官民一體努力增產，基於此種精神，於工作進行必可順利展開。總之，華北之增產成績極佳，煤斤有大量出產，其不能南運接濟華中者，其原因係運輸困難。今後變方應共同努力，必可達到良好結果。在華化時曾遇敵機來襲，蓋敵人方面深悉華北之重耍，故企圖擾亂，但以當局有充分之準備，敵方如思輕易嘗試，必這失敗。太人在華北時備受中日人士之聯合歡宴招待，剴切暢談，深感中日民心之融洽無間，其親善關係，已有飛躍之進展國府公佈禁毒治罪法國民政府令（三十三年六月三日），茲制定禁毒治罪法公布之，此令。主席汪兆銘，立法院院長陳公博。禁金治罪法（三十三年六月三日）公佈：</p>

<h3 id="c4">砲火連天下的羅馬市近況 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>在納吐諾登陸，試欲侵入羅馬而不果砲火連天下羅馬市在納吐諾登陸，試欲侵入羅馬而不馬而不果的英美軍，自十五日以來，從南部戰綫轉取大攻勢，欲開拓到羅馬的道路。羅馬實已變成「戰綫的首都」。謮責新聞社駐羅罩下種種紛亂亂的情形，報告於後：</p>
<p>食糧問題與德國的援助</p>
<p>大家都知道羅馬是義大利的首都，又是教廷的所在地，乃全世界舊教徒的巡　之所。這特殊情形給與羅馬一種超國家的性質。共和國政府為從戰火中挽救這歷史的都市，並為尊重教廷的意思保護聖地，乃於去年九月宣言為不設防城市；撤廢一切軍事設施，撤退政府機關，德軍亦遵守敎廷的意旨，撤廢軍事設施，過境時得道而行，尊頂這不設防都市。對此，英美方面雖經教廷再三呼籲，仍侵入羅馬上空，加以轟炸。最近特別集中於羅馬市及其周圖，不分畫夜，其目的不用設自在殺傷市民及攪亂神經。但對該市周圍反復加以轟炸，則欲截斷該市與外界的交通，杜絕其食糧補給的道路。</p>
<p>所以目前每個市民日常最大的難題是食糧問題。據去年十二月的國勢調查，羅馬的人口約近三百萬，而戰前的人口不足百萬時，食糧已感不足，所以現在的困難情形，可想而直。食糧品的價值，在想像以上，麥，麵類百倍以上，米一公斤四十元·這或許因為在三十公里外就是戰綫，物資不能進入的緣故，但一方面英美步承認羅馬為不設防城市，加以不人道的攻擊，妨害食糧補給所致。而被巴陀里奧出賣的羅馬市民之創被，一時亦艱恢復。</p>
<p>敎庭深以為憂，遺派自已的卡車赴近郊搜求食糧品，這汽車途上了白色與黃色的標職，上面用紅字大書　岡的字樣，但這也在白畫被英美機轟炸，近於四月二十九日，從菲倫翠歸還羅馬的途中，三十五輛運貨車午後一時被炸，受損頗重，且先前因襲　而死傷的儈侶駕駛員，亦為數頗多。德軍很憂處此種情形，在可能範圍因設法援助。先時，常德軍入城時即首先解決食糧問題，確立配給組織，在德軍撤退後的今日，更供給自己的軍用卡車以補其不足。自四月三十一日以來，更許可將一切食糧及木炭材搬入羅馬市內，並忍受一切不自由，而將軍用道路供市民使用。　　　恐怖與秩序</p>
<p>說到轟炸，近來來每日平均空襲三次，砲聲無日或息。因先巳宣言為不設防都中，沒有完備的防空　，死傷頗多，是以對空炸頗表恐怖。三月三日煤氣情被炸以後，廚房所用者均為木炭，這不炭來源大都是斬伐近郊的街樹，在前法西斯時代，物資雖稱缺乏，亦完全採配給制，至巴陀里奧時代，黑市續行，巴陀里奧叛變後，即黑市亦難購得物資。這種情形，使市民不禁回情法西斯政治的全成時代。跟着南部戰綫的重開，道傾向愈見强烈，怎樣應付這現實的戰事，乃成為問題。英美從事反德宣傳，並說羅馬市大騷動，罷工事件頻發，可是事實上這種事態絕不存在。每日報紙上所載，亦僅殺人越貨時件。擁有三百萬人口的大都市，離戰綫僅三十公里，而旣沒有暴動，亦無有組織的怠工，市民生活安定逾恒，買是不可思議的。</p>
<p>羅馬雖祇有一萬三千餘的非洲警察隊，舊憲兵，舊警察守衛着，但很有秋序。</p>
<p>羅馬的更生</p>
<p>食糧的困難與戰綫的迫近，驚醒了羅馬市民，於是羅馬市民自己組織起來，確保食糧，維持治安。德國方面極力避免干涉羅馬的內政，義國共和政府亦將羅馬特別辦理，於五月七日任命內政部次長白於洛·塞爾比諾氏爲羅馬最高委員，在　索里尼指導之下，着手討論羅馬的緊急對策。羅馬作為健全的都市，在完全的秩序下生活下去，則全世界　教徒亦將安心吧！假使這是更生義大利之精神的中心，此在三國同盟亦是極可喜的一件事。</p>
<p>現在的羅馬，初夏的緣葉，茂密地遮掩着街道的道路，爽利的風火拂着，這五月的朗澄的羅馬，民回到他們眞正的心上牽累著的故里。（翔：譯自五月二十三日東京讀資報知。）</p>

<p>廣州四日中央社電重慶當局對洛陽之陷落，至今日仍極力隱瞞。嗣因失陷之事贊暴露，乃謂洛陽及其外廓之連絡，已被切斷，情勢不明云云。又據三日美聯社電報稱，重慶軍事發言人對於洛陽陷落終於承認，並隊此說明如此：五月廿五日劇守洛陽之重慶軍，巳衝破日軍前哨綫，現已撤至洛陽被城外地，但該部隊依然被日軍包圍中。</p>

<p>東京四日中央社電日新聞特派員於洛陽陷落後，曾分赴龍門之石窟及白馬寺兩地，述該兩地之現狀如次：龍鬥之右窟。位於洛陽南二十八公里，有露天大石佛，該大佛之面積約有三十米，會受風雨之浸蝕，巳有一千餘年矣。斷崖中有大小無數之洞窟，穿貫其間，但此等洞窟中之佛戲有立者，有坐者，有脫鼻者，有斷折手臂者，其中亦有一部份洞窟，是缺乏此種佛像者。據附近居民談，過去美國人遊飭此地時，會將佛像之鼻及臂等刎運至上海云。白馬寺爲此問名刹，位於洛陽郊外三十公里，有佛塔爺立，其附近建友宏大之寺院堂字，在清冷泰之前，張貼有日軍長官之告示，其中有謂白馬寺爲中國佛教最古之寺院，自古以來，日本名會來朝佛者極衆，該塔實為居民崇敬之中心，深望各將兵予以保護。故當日軍進駐該城附近時，即派士兵駐守該寺，該寺和尙亦曾發表其信念，謂大多日人對於佛教造詣甚深誠屬偉大，余如今始覺對日軍之足以信賴也云云。</p>

<p>近兩年來，本市體育界活躍情形，尤其是大衆對於球類遝動感覺興趣，形成大衆化的運動，是値得可喜之現象。促成大衆化現象者，其間自有熱心體育人士盡力推動，以及體育界領導人士努力贊助。上月下旬為紀念日本海軍節，本市新開聯合會發起運動會，公開免費參觀，也是適應體育大衆化的原則。至於提倡體育，鍛練體格，足以促進國民健康，此等理論，固早已為一般人所了解，不待整詞解總矣。　　球類比賽，可以號召大量關衆，所以，社會公益事菜為籌募經費，頗多借靈作義賽之舉，成績很好，這完全是體育界於提倡體育的本位以外，兼為服務社會的貢獸，更値得欽佩。本報辦理助學金已歷六屆，對於助學運動之意義，早為社會人士共同了解，也無庸解釋。現第七屆已經開始，鑒於物價激增，本屆動用助金勢必更增，預擬以一千萬元為目標，除向各界呼籲捐助外，復承陳市長丁部長及體育會諸當局之協助，東華僑聯兩足球隊及各籃球隊常局曁諸還于之熱心，舉行足籃球義賽，足球部分為充裕收入起見，普通座價定為二百元外，另設榮譽座券分為三千五千一萬元三種，門票收入淨充助學金，一切開支均由本報担任。於此，或許有人以為座價過高，違背體育大衆化意義。可是，我們認為旣為助學金義賽，那末，無論購普通券或榮譽券觀球，都是為助學金表示盡一部份義務，就是球隊選手甚至本報也是為助學金盡一部分義務，立塲正復相同，旣非藉以為利，根本不違背提倡體育大衆化的原則。相信眞能認職助學金運動及體育大衆化意義的，必定不會有此見解的。况且，我們更認為惟其籍體目大衆化的機會，滲入助學運動的要求，也使之大衆化，那末，助學運動更能普遍，對於幫助淸寒學生，爲國育才，更能發生偉大貢獻。</p>
<p>最後，我們竭誠期待社會社會人士共同為助學金盡義務，同時，對於體育界的協助，表示感謝之忱。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hygiene <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The municipal health bureau is observing this month's 1st to 7th as Hygiene Promotion Week, and will hold a Hygiene Sports Meeting and a Hygiene Exhibition. The opening ceremony was grand and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. At the same time, the First District Public Works Office of this city also stated that it will strictly prohibit the construction of illegal buildings and try to reduce the flooding in western Shanghai. Detailed information from both parties can be found in the local news section of this newspaper from May 31st to June 2nd. As we are now promoting hygiene work, I would like to offer some humble suggestions for consideration.</p>
<p>Since August 1st of last year, citizens have placed great expectations on the entire structure of the municipal government. Therefore, there was enthusiastic public opinion at that time, with numerous articles and proposals, either outlining general principles or discussing detailed rules, in the hope that significant progress would be made within a reasonable period after the unification of municipal administration, and that the old appearance would be changed. What was mentioned in the editorials of this newspaper on August 14th and December 14th of last year has finally seen some motivation for realization today, especially with both agencies working hard in their respective positions, which makes the general public feel infinitely gratified and willing to wholeheartedly support them.</p>
<p>The people must be guided, so that it becomes a habit and is easy to promote. Therefore, publicity work, with its guiding and enlightening effect, must not be abandoned. However, governance is not about talking more, but about practice, and especially about focusing on effective methods. When seeing the defects revealed in reality, we should first deeply investigate the hidden roots. If the government uses its power to cut off the roots and block the source, then the appearance will be refreshed, and the expected goals will be achieved in a short period of time. This is more effective and efficient than requiring citizens to make incomplete efforts on their own. For example, the area around the garbage cans in various neighborhoods is currently littered, and the can walls are full of holes and the lids are missing. Even when building neighborhoods, the location of garbage cans was not taken into account at all. Household A pushes it in front of Household B's door, and Household B moves it under Household C's window, which leads to endless quarrels. Although this is a small problem, there should also be regulations to ensure that the placement and storage of garbage cans are the responsibility of someone, and that violations of the regulations will be subject to public sanctions, which may be more effective than the nagging of the neighborhood chief. This is just one example, and the rest can be deduced by analogy.</p>
<p>There are also things that citizens cannot do, but the authorities can issue orders in the morning and see results in the evening, which should not be neglected because they are trivial. For example, garbage is dumped on the main streets and thoroughfares before dusk, and garbage trucks are still running in the streets at noon, with dust flying and foul odors spreading, and the same is true for the work of sewage trucks. Such situations can be immediately eliminated if the hours are regulated and strictly enforced by the responsible departments. As for the accumulation of dirt that no one cares about for days, the dereliction of duty should be punished as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Closely related to hygiene requests are the issues of housing, water, and fuel. Five or six people in a family are confined to a small room, with insufficient air at normal times and no way to isolate when sick. Water and fire have the function of removing dirt and killing bacteria. If the amount used by each person is not up to standard, or the price is too high and they cannot afford to consume it, then even if they are well aware of the importance of hygiene, they will feel that it is easy to know but difficult to do. Only the authorities can explore and correct these subtleties, which citizens cannot do alone.</p>
<p>From the start of hygiene promotion to the day when the health goals of every citizen are achieved, there are many urgent measures to be taken. We hope that our authorities will deliberate and implement them after this week, which is what the citizens dare to hope for in addition to celebrating and following them.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 1:50 PM on the 4th: A strong enemy force landed near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea in mid-May.

<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – The enemy army landed near Hollandia and Aitape on April 22nd. Due to the resistance of the Japanese army, they could not form a looting strategy. It is reported that the enemy army is trying to land in various parts of western New Guinea, centered on Hollandia and Aitape. On the morning of May 17th, an enemy division, with 60-70 tanks and armored vehicles and 50 trucks, built a bridgehead on the west bank of the Tor River, 200 kilometers west of Hollandia. The Japanese army in the vicinity immediately cooperated with the Japanese army retreating from the vicinity of Hollandia to actively prepare to attack the enemy army. On the morning of the 27th, they launched a annihilation battle, first launching a surprise attack on the enemy army near Tem, 12 kilometers east of the mouth of the Tor River, inflicting heavy damage. The enemy abandoned 300 bodies. About 800 enemy troops near Tem were attacked by the Japanese army, and they fled to Wakde Island on the sea in a state of chaos in ten boats. Another part of the remaining enemy troops fled into nearby tribes. The Japanese army is currently pursuing the defeated enemy. On the 30th, another Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack on the main force of the enemy army occupying Arara Village, 8 kilometers east of the Tor River, and the left bank of the Tor River, breaking through the enemy's tank formation and minefield, and rushing directly into the enemy's position, continuing to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and finally driving the main force of the enemy army near these places to the water's edge on the morning of the 2nd, and thoroughly destroying it. Therefore, the strong enemy force that attempted to cut off the Japanese army's battle line in New Guinea and land, except for a part that fled to Wakde Island, most of them sacrificed at the water's edge. One of the bridgeheads used by the enemy army as a base for frog-jumping operations was also wiped out. The Japanese army is currently continuing to sweep away the remaining enemies. The Japanese army units on the New Guinea front annihilated about one regiment of the enemy army near Urau, 50 kilometers south of Aitape, from April 16th to early May. On May 3rd, they annihilated the enemy landing force at Yakamel, 30 kilometers east of Aitape, and are currently preparing to attack Aitape. The Japanese soldiers are singing victory songs one after another, and their morale is extremely high. They are continuing to launch an offensive against the enemy forces that landed in Biak, and the progress is also very smooth.</p>
<h3 id="e3">North China is Working Hard to Increase Production to Assist the Greater East Asia War: Remarks by Supreme Economic Advisor Mr. Ogura <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) – After inspecting the economy in North China, Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, met with Chinese reporters at 4:30 PM on the 3rd to release his observations on the economic situation in North China and his impressions of the trip. The following is a record: I went to North China on May 19th and returned to Nanjing on June 1st, for a total of twelve days. I was in Tianjin from the 21st to the 23rd, and spent the rest of the time in Beiping. Recalling that last September, I participated in the Mengjiang inspection group as a Japanese, and passed through Beiping, but I was unable to stay for long and conduct a detailed inspection. This time, I had the opportunity to conduct a detailed survey and inspect the economic situation in various parts of North China, and I was able to meet well-known figures in the economic and cultural circles of North China. I deeply feel that this trip is of great significance. The economic situation in North China and Central China may be different due to different local conditions, so it is impossible to make a general observation. However, North China is also a part of China, under the rule of the National Government. In terms of the entire economic policy, the same pace should be adopted. The biggest problem in China at present is stabilizing people's livelihood, so that human resources and material resources can be used to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. This time, I saw that North China is rich in coal, iron, and other mineral deposits, which contribute greatly to the war, so I feel very happy. However, if North China is to fully exploit its underground resources, it must rely on increased food production in Central China to supply North China and complete this mission. This is my opinion. Everything in North China is going smoothly this year. The Henan campaign and agricultural production have performed very well. At the same time, insightful people in North China have gained a deep understanding of the Greater East Asia War, and the same is true for ordinary people. This is what excites me the most. Because we are currently in a period of war, the harassment of the Eighth Route Army has a slight impact on security measures. Promoting increased production through the joint efforts of military officers and civilians can ensure the smooth progress of the work. In short, North China has achieved excellent results in increasing production, and a large amount of coal is being produced. The reason why it cannot be transported south to supply Central China is due to transportation difficulties. In the future, all parties should work together to achieve good results. While I was in China, enemy planes attacked. The enemy is well aware of the importance of North China, so they tried to disrupt it. However, because the authorities are fully prepared, if the enemy tries lightly, they will fail. While I was in North China, I was treated to joint banquets by Chinese and Japanese people, and we had candid conversations. I deeply feel that the hearts of the Chinese and Japanese people are in harmony and without gaps, and their friendly relations have made leaps and bounds.

<h3 id="e4">The Current Situation in the City of Rome Under the Thunder of Cannons <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Landing in Anzio, Trying to Invade Rome Unsuccessfully: The City of Rome Under the Thunder of Cannons. The Anglo-American forces that landed in Anzio, trying to invade Rome but failing, have launched a major offensive from the southern front since the 15th, seeking to open a road to Rome. Rome has indeed become a "capital on the front line." The correspondent of the Reader News Agency reports on the chaotic situation under Rome:</p>
<p>Food Problem and German Assistance</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Rome is the capital of Italy and the seat of the Holy See, the pilgrimage site for Catholics all over the world. This special situation gives Rome a supra-national character. In order to save this historic city from the flames of war and to respect the intentions of the Holy See to protect the holy sites, the Republican government declared it a non-defended city last September, abolishing all military facilities and withdrawing government agencies. The German army also observed the intentions of the Holy See, abolishing military facilities and passing through without hindering, respecting this non-defended city. In this regard, despite repeated appeals from the Holy See, the Anglo-American side still invaded Rome's airspace and bombed it. Recently, they have particularly focused on the city of Rome and its surroundings, day and night, with the aim of killing civilians and disrupting their nerves without any defense. However, the repeated bombing of the city's surroundings is intended to cut off the city's transportation with the outside world and block the road for food supply.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest daily difficulty for every citizen at present is the food problem. According to the national census of last December, the population of Rome is close to three million, while before the war, when the population was less than one million, food was already insufficient, so the current difficult situation is conceivable. The value of food is beyond imagination, wheat and noodles are more than a hundred times higher, and rice is forty yuan per kilogram. This may be because the front line is only thirty kilometers away and materials cannot enter, but on the one hand, the Anglo-American side does not recognize Rome as a non-defended city and carries out inhumane attacks, hindering the food supply. The trauma of the citizens of Rome being betrayed by Badoglio is also difficult to recover for a while.</p>
<p>The Holy See is deeply concerned and has sent its own trucks to the suburbs to search for food. These cars are marked with white and yellow signs, with the word "Vatican" written in red. However, these cars were also bombed by Anglo-American aircraft during the day. On April 29, thirty-five trucks returning to Rome from Florence were bombed at 1:00 PM, suffering considerable damage. Moreover, the number of monks and drivers who died or were injured due to previous attacks was also quite large. The German army is very worried about this situation and is trying to help within the possible scope. Previously, when the German army entered the city, they first solved the food problem and established a distribution organization. Today, after the German army's withdrawal, they are providing their own military trucks to make up for the shortage. Since April 31, they have allowed all food and charcoal to be transported into the city of Rome, and they endure all kinds of inconveniences, allowing the citizens to use military roads. Terror and Order</p>
<p>Speaking of bombing, there have been an average of three air raids per day recently, and the sound of cannons has never stopped. Because it was declared a non-defended city in advance, there are no complete air defense facilities, and there are many deaths and injuries, so people are very afraid of air raids. Since the gas company was bombed on March 3, charcoal has been used in kitchens. Most of the charcoal comes from cutting down street trees in the suburbs. In the former fascist era, although materials were said to be scarce, a complete rationing system was adopted. In the Badoglio era, the black market continued. After Badoglio's betrayal, it was difficult to buy materials even on the black market. This situation makes citizens unable to help but recall the golden age of fascist politics. Following the reopening of the southern front, the tendency to recall that era has become increasingly strong, and how to deal with this reality of war has become a problem. The Anglo-American side is engaged in anti-German propaganda and says that there are major riots and frequent strikes in the city of Rome, but in fact, such a situation does not exist at all. The daily newspapers only carry reports of murders and robberies. It is inconceivable that a metropolis with a population of three million, only thirty kilometers away from the front line, has no riots or organized strikes, and the lives of the citizens are stable.</p>
<p>Although Rome only has more than 13,000 African police officers, former military police, and former police officers guarding it, it is very orderly.</p>
<p>The Regeneration of Rome</p>
<p>The difficulty of food and the proximity of the front line have awakened the citizens of Rome. Therefore, the citizens of Rome have organized themselves to ensure food and maintain law and order. The German side has tried its best to avoid interfering in Rome's internal affairs, and the Italian Republican government has also given Rome special attention. On May 7, Interior Ministry Vice-Minister Bai Yulu Serbinuo was appointed as the highest commissioner of Rome. Under the guidance of [name], he began to discuss emergency measures for Rome. If Rome lives as a healthy city in complete order, Catholics all over the world will be at ease! If this is the spiritual center of a regenerated Italy, it is a very gratifying thing for the Three-Power Alliance as well.</p>
<p>In present-day Rome, the lush green leaves of early summer thickly cover the roads of the streets, and the brisk wind blows. In this bright and clear May in Rome, the people return to their true hearts and are burdened by their hometowns. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun, May 23rd.)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chongqing Admits Luoyang Has Fallen <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing authorities are still trying their best to conceal the fall of Luoyang. Later, because the fall was exposed, they said that the connection between Luoyang and its outer suburbs had been cut off, and the situation was unclear. According to a telegram from the Associated Press on the 3rd, a Chongqing military spokesman finally admitted the fall of Luoyang and explained it as follows: The Chongqing army that had been defending Luoyang broke through the Japanese army's outposts on May 25th and has now withdrawn to the area outside the city of Luoyang, but the troops are still surrounded by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Current State of Historical Sites in Luoyang and Other Places <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – After the fall of Luoyang, a special correspondent of the newspaper went to the Longmen Grottoes and the White Horse Temple and described the current state of the two places as follows: The Longmen Grottoes are located 28 kilometers south of Luoyang and have a large open-air stone Buddha. The area of the Buddha is about 30 meters and has been eroded by wind and rain for more than 1,000 years. There are countless caves of various sizes in the cliff, running through them. However, among the Buddha statues in these caves, some are standing, some are sitting, some have their noses broken off, and some have their arms broken off. There are also some caves that lack such Buddha statues. According to nearby residents, in the past, when Americans visited this place, they cut off the noses and arms of the Buddha statues and transported them to Shanghai. The White Horse Temple is a famous temple located 30 kilometers outside Luoyang. There is a pagoda standing, and large temple halls and halls are built nearby. Before the coldness and depression, there was a notice posted by a Japanese military officer, which said that the White Horse Temple is the oldest temple in Chinese Buddhism. Since ancient times, many famous Japanese have come to worship Buddha. The pagoda is the center of residents' respect, and it is hoped that all soldiers will protect it. Therefore, when the Japanese army entered the vicinity of the city, it sent soldiers to guard the temple. The monks of the temple also expressed their beliefs, saying that most Japanese people have a deep understanding of Buddhism and are truly great. Now, I realize that the Japanese army is trustworthy.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Ten Kilometers from Rome: The Battle Reaches Its Peak; American Tank Units Make Dense Attacks <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Mr. Bragner, a correspondent of the German News Agency on the Italian front: American troops dispatched a large number of powerful tank units and launched a dense attack between the Alban Mountains and the Lepini Mountains. Yesterday, the battle reached its peak. Because the enemy's mechanized units continued to pressure, the German front line had withdrawn. In the evening, the Anglo-American vanguard was completely blocked ten kilometers south of Rome. Their attempt to break into Rome has failed again due to the German army's stubborn resistance. The German army's defensive artillery fire was fierce, forcing the American troops on the front line to be replaced by reinforcements in the rear. It is not yet known whether the city of Rome, which has no defenses, has become a battlefield today.</p>
<p>Germany Does Not Station Troops in Rome to Preserve It</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – Pope Pius XII issued a statement on the 2nd, hoping that the flames of war would not spread to Rome. The German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 3rd regarding this matter, saying: The Pope's broadcast severely criticized the anti-Axis forces' combat methods, which is unprecedented. Although the Pope did not explicitly name the culprits for the unregulated combat methods, it can be understood who the culprits are by looking at the evil acts of bombing Rome, destroying the Monastery of Monte Cassino, and other cultural monuments. In addition, the Pope has issued a statement on the anti-Axis forces' refusal to allow the transportation of food by the Via Chietti convoy. Now, in order to avoid the effects of war on Rome, the German authorities have taken special measures, namely, that there are no German troops stationed in the city of Rome.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – Although the date for the Anti-Axis forces to establish a second front in Europe has been delayed, their air force's bombing of various parts of Europe has not stopped, and has even intensified recently. According to news from various places, the main air raids from the 2nd to the 3rd are summarized as follows: Anti-Axis aircraft raided various parts of Germany on the 2nd, and 27 aircraft were shot down by the German air defense forces. On the night of the 2nd, several British aircraft attacked Westphalia, Germany. The Anti-Axis air force bombed various parts of the Balkans and various cities in the two countries of Romania and Hungary. An American air force team bombed Calais and Boulogne on the northern coast of France with a formation of more than 500 heavy bombers. Another team bombed the Paris area again. It has been confirmed that the losses in the area were 93 deaths in Paris alone.</p>

<p>Ankara, 4th - Central News Agency Dispatch - Haitong News Agency: The resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister Said and the succession of Basha Shis have shed light on the internal political situation in Iraq. It is understood that Ba is a spokesperson for those in Iraq who are close to the Arab faction, and currently serves as the honorary chairman of the Baghdad Arab General Assembly. It is said that there are two reasons for Said's resignation: 1. The Iraqi government has encountered various difficulties in dealing with the Kurdish people, as the Kurdish people have the Soviet Union as their backing. 2. The Iraqi people admire the policies adopted by the Kuomintang, especially Jia Nani and his party members, while Said criticized Na Nani.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau took over the management of public utilities in the first district in February of this year, due to personnel issues and the failure of manufacturers to produce wheel licenses on schedule, citizens who went to obtain licenses were inconvenienced by overcharges or obstruction. In view of this, the authorities have specially and resolutely adjusted personnel, dismissed and punished employees who were derelict in their duties or extorted under the guise of business, and ordered officials in each office to provide convenience to citizens who register and obtain licenses in the future. In order to save citizens the trouble of applying for and obtaining licenses, a unified centralized registration of private human-powered vehicles and drivers will be implemented from June 1st. Citizens can complete the procedures for applying for licenses and changing licenses within one day, so citizens will no longer have to make fruitless trips back and forth to change licenses in the future. However, due to the large number of vehicles in this city, it is hoped that citizens will line up in an orderly manner and wait to be processed to maintain order. It is also hoped that citizens will cooperate and report any negligent employees, and they will be severely punished once verified.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health previously limited the time for all practicing and currently employed doctors to obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Health before June 15th in order to be legal, otherwise they would be ordered to suspend business. The Shanghai Special City National Medical Association and the Doctors Association, in order to facilitate members to apply for certificate renewals and pay supplementary certificate printing fees, can submit the relevant procedures to the association for transfer before the deadline.</p>

<p>The price trend in the past week fluctuated sharply, which was purely due to the sharp rise in black market rice prices. However, the reserves of various materials are still quite sufficient, and there is no shortage of future supply. However, some people in the market are using abundant floating funds to hoard and speculate, resulting in a reduction in the number of spot supplies on the market. Merchants are therefore raising prices to profit, citing "scarcity makes things valuable." Therefore, to stabilize the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai, the first step is to restore land and water transportation in various places and procure materials on a large scale.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Short Commentary - The Contribution of the Sports Community <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In the past two years, the sports community in this city has been active, especially the public's interest in ball sports, which has formed a mass movement. This is a gratifying phenomenon. Among those who have promoted this mass phenomenon, there are naturally enthusiastic sports people who have tried their best to promote it, as well as sports leaders who have worked hard to support it. In late April, to commemorate the Japanese Navy Day, the newly opened Joint Association in this city launched a sports meeting, which was open to the public for free viewing. This is also in line with the principle of mass sports. As for promoting sports and exercising the body, which can promote national health, these theories have long been understood by the general public and do not need to be explained. Ball games can attract a large number of spectators. Therefore, many social welfare events use charity matches to raise funds, and the results are very good. This is entirely because the sports community, in addition to promoting sports, also provides services to the community, which is even more admirable. This newspaper has been running the scholarship fund for six sessions, and the significance of the scholarship movement has long been understood by the public and does not need to be explained. The seventh session has already begun. In view of the sharp increase in prices, the scholarship fund used in this session will inevitably increase further. It is planned to set a target of 10 million yuan. In addition to appealing to all sectors of society for donations, we have also received assistance from Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, and the authorities of the sports association. The Donghua and Overseas Chinese United soccer teams and various basketball teams, as well as the enthusiasm of the team members, will hold charity soccer and basketball games. For the soccer games, in order to increase revenue, the price of ordinary seats will be set at 200 yuan, and honorary seat tickets will be set at 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 yuan. The net income from ticket sales will be used for the scholarship fund, and all expenses will be borne by this newspaper. At this point, some people may think that the seat prices are too high and violate the meaning of mass sports. However, we believe that since it is a charity match for the scholarship fund, then whether you buy ordinary tickets or honorary tickets to watch the game, you are expressing your obligation to contribute to the scholarship fund. The players and even this newspaper are also fulfilling their obligations to the scholarship fund. The positions are exactly the same. Since it is not for profit, it does not violate the principle of promoting mass sports. I believe that those who can truly recognize the scholarship movement and the meaning of mass sports will not have this view. Moreover, we believe that only by taking advantage of the opportunity of mass sports to incorporate the requirements of the scholarship movement and make it popular, can the scholarship movement be more widespread and make a greater contribution to helping poor students and cultivating talents for the country.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely look forward to all sectors of society fulfilling their obligations to the scholarship fund and expressing our gratitude for the assistance of the sports community.</p>
