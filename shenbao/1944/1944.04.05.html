<h3 id="c1">革新地方政制 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>革新政治，是我們一貫的主張。在平時，是國家趨於興盛的必要途徑。在戰時，是增强戰力的主要步驟。尤其在目前大東亞戰爭進入決戰階段，中國是參戰國家，所應担負的任務非常艱鉅，因此，革新政治無論在主觀土客觀上都是刻不容緩。</p>
<p>我們對於革新政治的主張，以建立專家政治，建立民意機關為前提，對此二者的重耍性及其建立步驟，我們巳經數四論列。建立專家政冶，是在用人唯才，健全人事。不過，政治制度與健全人事，同處重要地位。所以改進政制，也是革新政治中的主要項目。今天願就革新攻制一事，略申管見。</p>
<p>近來一般國人的月光，大都集注於中央政治的加强，當然，中央政治是中樞神經，加强健全，自有必要。所以，國人目光集注於中央，並非不當。然而，就整個政治的觀點，加强中央政治，還是整個中的局部，而同樣重要的還有地方政洽，地方政治是基礎，猶之造屋，基礎穩固以後，屋面可以穩間。所以，革新地方政制實應與革新中央政制等量霽觀，而不可偏忽。</p>
<p>中央政治是點，省區政治是綫，縣區政治是面，加强了點和綫，而忽略了面，那末，這個點和綫的力量，就不足以控制全部面的主宰而使之亦步亦趨。簡言之，縣區政治未能先使强化，則中央與省的政治，縱已强化，而所施行的政令，還是未能普遍推行至最好階段，收獲最好成效。所以，我們主張革新縣地方政制，應與革新省與中央政制同時並進。</p>
<p>本報今天發表讀者新民君的「地方行政制度革新芻見」一文，頗具見地。尤其關於縣制革新與設置諮詢機關，尤爲扼要。縣爲地方行政之基礎，一切政令均賴縣府直接推行，目前縣府組織，過於簡陋，而縣長待遇及地位太低，有資望能力者，有願擔任，任之者大多別有企圖，於是縣政不堪問聞。一切政務在中央僅負設計指導之責，在地方必須切實推行，倘地方無相當能員負責，則中央雖勵精圖治，亦絕難獲實際效果。這些情形，權是目前地方行政之最大缺點。所以，提高縣長地位與待遇，吸引有資望能力者擔任，則中骨政令得以貫澈推行，獲致上下呼應盡利之效果，尤為切要。</p>
<p>其次，省府與縣府均應建立民意機構，溝通人民對於政治上應興應革的意見。在未設參議會以前，應先設置諮詢委員會，以備政府諮詢及建議。這些主張，都是在革新政制中必須顧到之要點。</p>
<p>此外，我們認爲革新地方政制中最應注意的問題，還有防範共黨與重慶方面的政治破壤工作，防範的方法，不僅在政治，就實際分析，應為二分軍事，四分政治，四分經濟。因為渝共破壞工作，在地方政府區域內肆行尤力，防範方面，在軍事範圍，究限局部，在政治範圍，亦不能普遍，惟有以經濟與我洽同等力量配合防範，才能杜塞一切可乘之隙。</p>
<h3 id="c2">加羅林南方海面日軍獲顯赫戰果　來襲美有力機動部隊重創 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大木營四日下午三時發表：　三月二十九日，敵有力機動部隊出現加羅林羣島南方海面，該方面我航空部隊當即出動邀擊　自三月二十九日夜起，至四月一日止，反覆轟炸，計炸沉敵巡洋艦二艘，炸燬戰艦二艘，航空母艦一艘及大型軍艦一艘等。敵軍又自三月三十日起至四月一日止，空襲帕勞君島，雅普島及美萊庸島各島，日軍部隊當即邀擊，計擊落其八十餘架，日方稍有損失。　敵方於上述期間出動其基地之航空部隊，空襲馬紹爾羣島，東加羅林羣島，俾斯麥羣島及新幾內亞方面，各地日軍當即迎擊，擊落並擊毀其約六十架，將其擊退。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日軍三月廿九日在加羅林羣島南方海國，發現以航空母艦及戰艦主幹之敵主力機動部隊，警戒中之日航空部隊，當即猛擊敵艦，自二十九日夜迄四月一日，反覆猛攻，計於二十九日重創敵航空母艦一艘，並已起火，其餘三艦，亦中魚雷而傾斜，炸沉敵巡洋艦二艘，其他戰艦一艘，亦中魚雷起火，並重創敵大型身艦一艘而起火。又敵機動部隊會於三十日迄四月一日來襲帕勞羣島，雅普島及美萊席島該方面日軍部隊即在帕勞島東方海而攻擊敵軍，擊落敵機八十餘架，即三十。三十一兩日在帕勞方面繫落十三架，三十日貝里里馬帕勞羣島南方擊落六十架，四月一日在美萊庸島繫落八架，共計八十一架。其問敵機雖會出動其航空部隊連續空襲馬紹爾羣島，查羅特賽，塔羅阿島，東加羅林羣島，波納爾，俾斯麥羣島及拉巴爾，威瓦克，特邲克等地，然各該新蛻之日軍，對之猛烈反攻，並在咸瓦克方面擊落敵機十五架，至其他方面擊落敵機二十七架，擊毀敵機十四架以上，共計五十六架云</p>
<h3 id="c3">日印軍節節推進戰局已達最高潮　英方承認連絡綫被切斷 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>印緬國境日軍某基地四日中央社電　日印同盟軍三月二十八日夜十時，在密休將伊姆法爾至哥希馬之敵最大補給路完全遮斷後，即向馬尼布爾平原前進，先後擊潰伊姆法爾之先衛據點南下，實行總攻。又自三月二十九日以來，即在克里爾河（伊姆法爾東側）下遊二十公里之地點附近，對敵展開總攻擊之前哨戰，日印兩軍到處覆減敵據點，有突入馬尼布爾平原之勢。另一部隊日印軍，於三月二十八晟自桑加克（伊姆法爾東）北三十公里前進，刻已突破馬尼布爾公路，向南急進，完成進攻伊姆法爾之態勢，頃以伊姆法爾爲中心之總攻擊，愈形緊迫，該方面戰局實已達於最高潮。</p>
<p>緬甸國境前綫四日中央社電　緬甸方面頓扎恩北方山中，及新開爾附近之英軍，第十七師，殘部約四千人，因日軍之猛攻，薩於潰滅狀態後，即遁往新開爾北方十五公里之齊達茲。查明敵軍在新開爾附近一役中之損失，計遺屍九百七十五具，遺棄迫擊砲十六門，及其他兵器甚夥。又是役陣亡及受傷之敵運往後方者，亦為數不少，由此而觀，敵第十七師殘部於此已被完全殲滅矣。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據新德里電，傳東南亞反軸心軍司令部三日正式承認，伊姆法爾隊哥希隊間之連絡錢，已完全被切斷。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日末次大將　談南洋戰局　敵擊加羅林乃偵察戰 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　敵方焦慮南太平洋戰局之膠着狀態，乃復以有力機動部隊强襲加羅林羣島，日軍對此已予以重創，收獲偉大戰果，日大本營已於本日將之發表，日末次信正海軍大將，頃就此談稱：敵機動部前曾强襲特邲克島及馬紹爾羣島，故此次之來襲帕勞羣島等，乃當然之歸趨，該方面日軍航空部隊，早有萬全準備，是當發現敵艦隊時，立即對之攻擊，已獲得相當戰果，此足證日軍航空部隊已漸開始發揮威力，現敵方極力宣傳，自此設後，內南洋戰局已進入第二階段，然此空襲，　於戰略上之意義，吾人可指出不外二點：　以機動部隊實行空襲，僅爲一時性者，並無决定之效果。　陸上基地被炸，所受損失極輕，蓋一兩日之空襲，實不能變更被攻地點之戰略，而且所受損失，隨時即可修復，故敵方之宣傳，僅為一種謀略而已。日軍戰略態勢，並不因此動搖，總之，是役乃敵方為測察加羅林羣島日軍實力之偵察戰也，日軍航空努力與日俱增，敵方若仍不知進退，不久日軍必可獲得國民所期待之大戰果，故戰局之轉換，已為期不遠矣。</p>

<p>太原四日中央社電　日軍各部隊會於山西省內繼續討伐渝共軍，至三月中旬所獲綜合戰果如次：　日方收容敵屍三六三具，俘虜一一二人，　鹵獲品輕機槍五挺，擲彈筒一個，小槍一四五枝，手槍七枝，無綫機一座，發電機一座，其他子彈甚多。</p>
<h3 id="c7">渝軍侵犯外蒙事件　蘇渝互相責難 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社。據稱在吾人一致謀反軸心陣營相互協力之今日，新疆之渝軍與外蒙古軍之發生衝突事件實深遺憾，察蘇聊與外蒙間於一九三六年已締結軍事同盟條約，規定蘇軍保障外蒙之安全，然在該條約締結之先，重慶與蘇聯即己於一九二四年締結基本條約，規定蘇聯與重慶間之正當關係，時蘇聯亦曾承認外蒙爲中華民國之領土，然今當新蒙境界發生衝突事件之際，蘇當局竟出諸以上措置，欲藉蘇蒙軍事條約支持外蒙軍，其此種見解，重慶當局實不贊同，蘇聯如認外蒙古爲中華民國之一部，則蘇聯不應干涉新疆外蒙間之紛爭事件云。</p>

<p>防空强化要項，乃處在空襲必至之緊迫現階段，更一層整備鐵一般的防衛態勢，同時使從來之各防衛措施，移入實戰化的方向，其主要題目為工廠防空完備，空襲被害之極限，空襲時之善後措置準備，疏散促進之四點，防空總本部再將製成决定其具體案，因爲要迅速實施已於二月二十五日夜召開總本部局課長會議。自防空總本部展開步義以來四個月，以疏散問題爲中心，推近來的防空行政，擴大防空改正法之發動範圍，動員全局課，在防空的所有分野，發揮總本部的機能。而使空襲時最少限度防止生產力之打擊及國民生活的動搖。因此强調工　防空設施工廠防空組織及被害極限的準備訓練，物件遭書的恢復修理，食糧配給，救護，簡易住宅之建設等。又關於疎散間題，遷移威除去沒有影　生產之設施或防空上脆弱建築物以外，對於一般人民集團之疎散；亦在考盧新方法，以期發生效果。</p>
<p>權限委任</p>
<p>關於中央監督事務之地方委任，政府與各中央官衙協議，應委任之事項即在閣議决定，業已有一千數百件的事項由中央委任於地方，為更强化積極化起見，在原則上除萬不得已的事項以外，其餘部份即澈底委任地方當局或官吏，如有必要時，在中央僅指示大綱或由事後報吿面處理。關於各事項，由內閣與各省及早决定，而將儘迅實行。（弘譯自二月二十七日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c16">地方行政制度革新芻見 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 新民</p>
<p>（甲）現行省縣制度之缺點</p>
<p>省政府為地方行政指導監督機構，過去省區潦廣，監督難於周密，雖屬有縮小之議，迄未實行。近年設置行政督察專員。分區督導，成效雖有，而缺點尚多。</p>
<p>省政府非直接執行政務機關，組織不宜龐大。目前省與縣之組織，殊右頭重脚輕之弊，且人才集中一隅，亦不經濟。</p>
<p>省府各廳局處對縣府同時指揮，政出多門，縣府難於應付，且上司太多，動輒得咎，縣政因是不能推行。</p>
<p>縣長地位及待遇太低，有資望，有能力者，多不願擔任，任之者，大多別有企圖，於是縣政不可問矣。</p>
<p>縣為地方行政之基礎，一切政令均賴縣府直接推行。惟目前縣府組織，過於簡陋，分工亦欠細密。然一切政務在中央僅負設計指導之責，在地方必須切實推行，倘地方無專人負責，非置而不問，即敷衍　塞，如是中央雖勵精圖治，亦絕難獲實際效果也。</p>
<p>（乙）省制革新辦法</p>
<p>爲求權力集中，辦事敏捷，並節省人力物力起見，省府組織應力求簡單，原右各聽局處一律撤銷。</p>
<p>省府置左列各司：</p>
<p>第一司　掌理總務等事項，第二司　掌理財政地政等事項，第三司　掌理農工商業及合作等事項政院院畏之命，綜理全省行政事務。</p>
<p>省府設秘書長，副秘書長各一人，參事六人至八人。</p>
<p>省府各司設司長一人，帮辦一人，各司對外不得行文。</p>
<p>在未設參議會前，省府應設諮詢委員，延攬地方士紳名流，以備諸詢及建議。</p>
<p>秘書長，參事，司長及督察使，縣長等，均由省長遴選，呈請中央節任。</p>
<p>省長應兼任省保安司令，負責全省保安，淸鄉事務，並得設置保安司令部，及省保安團隊，司令下設參謀長，副參謀長各一人，以軍人任之。</p>
<p>省長爲係國民黨黨員，並應兼任省黨部主仟委員，其下設常務委員二人至四人，由中央指派之</p>
<p>（丙）行政督察專員制度革新辦法</p>
<p>行政督察專員，職銜似嫌累贅，為改稱督察使，似較簡便，且較尊崇</p>
<p>督察使所轄縣區，少則三縣，至多四縣，轄境過多，必無法管理，而等於盧設。</p>
<p>督察使所轄縣區，應於職銜上標明，如所轄為鎭江。丹陽。金壇。句容四縣，則稱為「鎭丹金句區督察使」，似較「第某區」為明晰。</p>
<p>督察使之地位及待遇，應與原有廳局長相等，原有各廳局裁撤後，即以廳局長調任督察使，尤為一舉兩得。</p>
<p>督察使署置左記各一組：</p>
<p>第一組掌理總務事項。第二組掌理教育。宣傳。新運。社會。禮俗。衛生等事項。第三組掌理財政。地政。交通。水利。林墾。經濟。合作等事項。第四組掌理警政。保甲。淸鄉等事項。</p>
<p>督察使承省長之命，督導全區行政。</p>
<p>督察使得兼任縣長，俾以本縣政績為他縣示範。</p>
<p>督察使應兼任區保安司令，負全區保安淸鄉之責。所有保安淸鄉事務，由督察使署第四組兼辦，不另置區保安司令部，但得設置區保安團隊。</p>
<p>（丁）縣制革新辦法</p>
<p>縣長官階應普遍提高為簡任，其地位與省政府各司長相等，除俸給外，應規定其公費及機密費</p>
<p>縣爲地方行政之基礎，縣府組織，應求完備，分工務須細密，且時代進化，政務繁複，過於簡　，絕難應付，故縣府應置左列各科：一，總務科，二，財政科，三，地政科，四，經濟第一科，五，經濟第二科，六，公務公用科，七，水利林墾科，八，教育科，九，宣傳新運科，十，社會　俗科，十一，衛生科，十二警政科，十三，保甲科，十四保安科。</p>
<p>縣長承省長之命，综理全縣行政事務，並愛督察使之指導監督。</p>
<p>各區區長，警察所長，稅所所長，救濟院長，學校校長等，均由縣長遴選，呈請省政府加委。</p>
<p>縣長應兼縣保安司令，負全縣保安務鄉之賣，所有保安淸鄉事務，由縣政府保安科兼辦，不另置司令部，但得設置縣保安團隊。</p>
<p>縣長如係國民黨黨員，並應兼任縣黨部主任委員，其餘委員，由省黨部指派之。</p>
<p>在未設縣參議會以前，縣府應設置諸詢委員會，延攬地方士紳名流，備以諮詢及建議。</p>

<p>木報對於建立民意機關，可說是年餘以來一貫主張。我們認為國家復興，必須革新政治；革新政治，必須建立民意機關，所以，木辭煩厭車複，肯定陳詞。最近於三月十七日社評，仍主張從速建立民意機關，為革新上海的重要課題，與健全人事，經濟一元化，等量齊觀。在最近一週中，市府任用吳頌皋氏為第一區公署署長兼市府秘書長，態劍東氏任保安處長兼淸鄉事務局長，這是健全人事的開始。現在又設立市政絡詢委員會，這是建立民意機關的開始。同時，也就是革新上海，建設新上海的開始。我們居於市民的立場，擁護這些賢明措施的開展與貫澈，除竭力協贊以外，願拭目以觀成　。</p>

<p>僻處在南市董家渡的一角，偌大的曠塲中，流浪兒童的大家庭——上海福幼院，便設在這塲的一端。它的歷史，還僅僅祗有兩年又三個月，但是內部的設施和布置，却出於想象之外。</p>
<p>這裹兒童的成份，一部份由兒童保陸科保送，一部份是在街頭隨時看到有無家可歸而尙足以造就的兒童，隨時把他們領回</p>
<p>副院長董先生，是一個熱心慈幼工作的人，他對於兒童很愛護，兒童們對他也很親暱，當我去的時候，正有一羣年齡較大的孩子緊在一塊談話，看見董先生，都很有禮貌的行着禮，他們的服裝很整潔，面貌也頗端正，據說他們本來也是這裘收養的孤兒，現在已被介紹到外面學業去了，今天是兒童節，他們特地跑回來，看看他們的弟妹們，同時來望望他們的慈祥的董先生，他們已都把這裹認做了他們的第二個家了。</p>
<p>房屋的寬大，是他們的特色，全院現有兒童二百三十名，據說如果經費有辦法的話，就是收養五百名也不成問題，寢室九大間，一律打着地舖，室內地板上攤着大幅的紅毯子，被頭折好放在一旁，年幼的兒童和保姆睡在一室，生皮膚病和生病的，又分做兩室，一間醫療室，有着簡單的醫華設備，請着一位女看護：兒童們的牙刷茶杯，放在一個編號的木架上，脫下來的衣服，和各人的袋子，掛在一室，也編號碼，毫不紊亂。室內室外，洒掃十分乾净，這些都是兒童們自已動手的。</p>
<p>生活一斑</p>
<p>每天的作息，有一定的時間，生活的方式，也採工讀制，但低年級兒童是全日上課，中高級兒童，才實施半工半護，工塲有縫紉漆工·木工·鞋工四種，都在工作着，有的請有專家指導，課堂四間，操塲一塊面積很大，敎師七人，課程完全小學編制。</p>
<p>食的方面：是兩粥一飯，粥是食米和洋山芋伴煮，小菜是靑菜豆腐之類，每天下午有一次豆腐獎作點心，身體壤的兒童，每火供給雞蛋兩枚，體絡較弱的，每天一枚。</p>
<p>該院的經費，每月支出在十五萬元左右，究全靠社會的捐助，這裏他們對於兒童們閱讀的刋物，醫療的藥品，娛樂的玩具，很感到缺乏和需要，希望社會的熱心人士們量力捐贈，不論多少都歡迎。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reforming Local Governance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reforming politics is our consistent proposition. In peacetime, it is a necessary path for the country to move towards prosperity. In wartime, it is a major step to enhance combat power. Especially now that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, China is a participating country, and the tasks it should shoulder are very arduous. Therefore, reforming politics is an urgent matter both subjectively and objectively.</p>
<p>Our proposition for reforming politics is based on establishing expert governance and establishing people's representative bodies. We have discussed the importance of these two and the steps to establish them many times. Establishing expert governance means using talent wisely and improving personnel management. However, political systems and sound personnel management are equally important. Therefore, improving the political system is also a major item in reforming politics. Today, I would like to briefly express my humble opinion on reforming the political system.</p>
<p>Recently, the attention of most Chinese people has been focused on strengthening central politics. Of course, central politics is the central nervous system, and it is necessary to strengthen and improve it. Therefore, it is not inappropriate for the people of the country to focus their attention on the central government. However, from the perspective of overall politics, strengthening central politics is only a part of the whole. Equally important is local politics. Local politics is the foundation. It is like building a house. After the foundation is solid, the roof can be stable. Therefore, reforming the local political system should be given equal importance as reforming the central political system and should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a plane. If the point and the line are strengthened, but the plane is neglected, then the power of this point and line will not be enough to control the entire plane and make it follow suit. In short, if county politics is not strengthened first, then even if the politics of the central government and the provinces have been strengthened, the policies implemented will still not be universally promoted to the best stage and achieve the best results. Therefore, we advocate that reforming the county local political system should be carried out simultaneously with reforming the provincial and central political systems.</p>
<p>Today, this newspaper published an article by a reader, Mr. Xinmin, entitled "Humble Opinions on Reforming the Local Administrative System," which is quite insightful. In particular, the reform of the county system and the establishment of advisory bodies are particularly important. The county is the foundation of local administration, and all policies rely on the county government for direct implementation. At present, the county government organization is too simple, and the county magistrate's treatment and status are too low. Those with qualifications and abilities are unwilling to take the position, and those who take the position mostly have other intentions, so the county's political situation is unbearable to hear about. All political affairs are only responsible for design and guidance in the central government, and must be effectively implemented in the local government. If the local government does not have competent personnel responsible, then even if the central government is determined to govern well, it will be difficult to achieve practical results. These situations are the biggest shortcomings of the current local administration. Therefore, it is especially important to improve the status and treatment of county magistrates and attract qualified and capable people to take office, so that the central government's policies can be thoroughly implemented and achieve the effect of responding to each other and maximizing benefits.</p>
<p>Secondly, people's representative bodies should be established in both the provincial government and the county government to communicate the people's opinions on political matters that should be developed and reformed. Before the establishment of a council, an advisory committee should be set up first for government consultation and suggestions. These proposals are essential points that must be considered in reforming the political system.</p>
<p>In addition, we believe that the most important issues to pay attention to in reforming the local political system include preventing political sabotage by the Communist Party and Chongqing. The methods of prevention, not only in politics, but from a practical analysis, should be 20% military, 40% political, and 40% economic. Because the destructive work of the Chongqing Communists is particularly strong within the areas of local governments, prevention, in the military sphere, is limited to the local area, and in the political sphere, it cannot be universal. Only by coordinating prevention with the same strength of the economy as we do with politics can we block all exploitable gaps.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Striking Results Achieved by Japanese Forces in Seas South of the Carolines; Enemy Mobile Force of Considerable Strength Attacking Suffers Heavy Damage <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 4th: On March 29th, an enemy mobile force of considerable strength appeared in the sea south of the Caroline Islands, and our air force in that area immediately went out to intercept it. From the night of March 29th to April 1st, bombing was repeated, sinking two enemy cruisers, damaging two battleships, one aircraft carrier, and one large warship. From March 30th to April 1st, the enemy also launched air raids on the islands of Palau, Yap, and Melejon. Japanese forces immediately intercepted and shot down more than 80 enemy planes, suffering slight losses on the Japanese side. During the above period, the enemy dispatched its air force from its bases and launched air raids on the Marshall Islands, the Eastern Caroline Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and New Guinea. Japanese forces in various places immediately counterattacked, shooting down and destroying about 60 enemy planes and driving them back.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): On March 29th, Japanese forces discovered an enemy main mobile force centered on aircraft carriers and battleships in the sea south of the Caroline Islands. The Japanese air force on alert immediately attacked the enemy ships, and from the night of the 29th to April 1st, repeated fierce attacks resulted in the severe damaging of one enemy aircraft carrier on the 29th, which caught fire. The other three ships were also hit by torpedoes and capsized. Two enemy cruisers were sunk, and one other battleship was also hit by torpedoes and caught fire. One large enemy warship was also severely damaged and caught fire. In addition, the enemy mobile force attacked the Palau Islands, Yap, and Melejon from the 30th to April 1st. Japanese forces in that area immediately attacked the enemy forces east of Palau Island, shooting down more than 80 enemy planes. Specifically, 13 were shot down in the Palau area on the 30th and 31st, 60 were shot down south of Peleliu Palau on the 30th, and 8 were shot down at Melejon on April 1st, totaling 81. During that time, although enemy planes dispatched their air force to continuously raid the Marshall Islands, Truk, Taroa Island, the Eastern Caroline Islands, Ponape, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Rabaul, Wewak, and Trobriand, the newly deployed Japanese forces in these areas fiercely counterattacked and shot down 15 enemy planes in the Wewak area. A total of 56 enemy planes were shot down in other areas, and more than 14 enemy planes were destroyed.</p>

<p>From a certain Japanese military base on the Indo-Burma border, 4th (Central News Agency): After the Japanese-Indian allied forces completely cut off the enemy's largest supply route from Imphal to Kohima at 10 p.m. on March 28th, they advanced towards the Manipur Plain, successively defeating the advance guard strongholds of Imphal, moving south, and launching a general offensive. Since March 29th, they have also been engaged in preliminary battles against the enemy in the vicinity of a point 20 kilometers downstream of the Khil River (east of Imphal) prior to launching a general attack. The Japanese-Indian forces have reduced enemy strongholds everywhere, threatening to break into the Manipur Plain. Another unit of Japanese-Indian forces advanced 30 kilometers north of Sangak (east of Imphal) on March 28th and has now broken through the Manipur highway, rushing south, completing the posture of attacking Imphal. The general offensive centered on Imphal is becoming increasingly urgent, and the battle situation in that area has reached its climax.</p>
<p>From the Burmese border front, 4th (Central News Agency): The remnants of the British 17th Division, about 4,000 men, in the mountains north of Tonzang in Burma and near Sinkal, were routed by the fierce Japanese attack and fled to Chindas, 15 kilometers north of Sinkal. An investigation of the enemy's losses in the battle near Sinkal showed that 975 bodies were left behind, along with 16 mortars and many other weapons. In addition, a considerable number of enemy troops were killed and wounded in the battle and transported to the rear. From this, it can be seen that the remnants of the enemy's 17th Division have been completely annihilated here.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Headquarters officially acknowledged on the 3rd that the communication line between Imphal and Kohima had been completely cut off.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese General Suematsu Discusses the Southern Pacific Battle Situation; Enemy's Attack on the Carolines Was a Reconnaissance Battle <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): The enemy, anxious about the stalemate in the South Pacific battle situation, launched a powerful attack on the Caroline Islands. The Japanese army has inflicted heavy damage on them and achieved great results. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters has announced this today. Japanese Navy General Nobumasa Suematsu recently commented on this, saying: The enemy mobile forces previously launched strong attacks on Truk Island and the Marshall Islands, so this attack on the Palau Islands, etc., is a natural consequence. The Japanese air force in that area was fully prepared and immediately attacked the enemy fleet when it was discovered, achieving considerable results. This proves that the Japanese air force has gradually begun to exert its power. The enemy is now vigorously publicizing that the South Pacific battle situation has entered the second stage since this event. However, regarding the strategic significance of this air raid, we can point out no more than two points: 1. Air raids carried out by mobile forces are only temporary and have no decisive effect. 2. The losses suffered by land bases that have been bombed are extremely minor. After all, one or two days of air raids cannot change the strategy of the attacked location, and the losses suffered can be repaired at any time. Therefore, the enemy's propaganda is only a kind of tactic. The Japanese military's strategic posture will not be shaken by this. In short, this battle was a reconnaissance battle by the enemy to assess the strength of the Japanese forces in the Caroline Islands. The Japanese air force is increasing its efforts day by day. If the enemy still does not know when to advance or retreat, the Japanese army will soon be able to achieve the great results that the nation expects. Therefore, the transformation of the battle situation is not far away.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): It is regrettable that at a time when we are all working together to oppose the Axis powers, a conflict has occurred between the Chongqing troops in Xinjiang and the Outer Mongolian troops. It is noted that the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia concluded a military alliance treaty in 1936, stipulating that the Soviet army would guarantee the security of Outer Mongolia. However, before the conclusion of that treaty, Chongqing and the Soviet Union had already concluded a basic treaty in 1924, stipulating the legitimate relationship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. At that time, the Soviet Union also recognized Outer Mongolia as the territory of the Republic of China. However, now, when a conflict has occurred on the border between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia, the Soviet authorities have taken the above measures, wanting to support the Outer Mongolian army by means of the Soviet-Mongolian military treaty. The Chongqing authorities do not agree with this view. If the Soviet Union recognizes Outer Mongolia as part of the Republic of China, then the Soviet Union should not interfere in the disputes between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): The German authorities announced on the 3rd: The main force of the German army in the lower reaches of the Bug River, from Nikolaev to Berezovka, has decided to withdraw to Odessa and the lower reaches of the Dniester River, covered by the German defensive forces on the Voznesensk, Berezovka, and Tiraspol lines, and carry out withdrawal operations. The Soviet offensive in the area between Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, and Stanisławów, and the central area of Ternopil, has weakened significantly. It is expected that the Soviet army will not be able to use its reserve forces to launch attacks on the Hungarian border and in the Carpathian Mountains. The Hungarian army is now launching counteroffensives against the Soviet army in that area amid snow. German forces in Ternopil, Brody, Kovel, and other places, although surrounded, have repelled the Soviet army after two days of brave fighting.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported: Although the Soviet army attempted to ravage the German line with a twenty-fold advantage, the German line south of Pskov remains unmoved. News from other parts of the eastern front stated that the Soviet army has no large-scale activity because the major defensive battles are still concentrated on the key points in the southern region. The Soviet army has failed to achieve any goals on the southern front, and the German line in that area has been consolidated. The German High Command is now able to control the situation.</p>

<p>Active Utilization of Held Resources</p>
<p>The active utilization of held resources, whether in government offices, companies, or households. All materials that have been collected and unused until now, are to be taken out at this time and contribute to combat power. For example, old magazines and useless books should all be recycled into paper. The implementation of this method does not adopt special legal measures, but relies solely on enlightenment and publicity campaigns. In government offices, banks, companies, etc., regulations that originally prescribed the storage period for account books and other items should shorten this period in order to promote the use of old items.</p>
<p>Strengthening Air Defense</p>
<p>The key to strengthening air defense is to be in a state of urgent circumstances where air raids are inevitable, and to further prepare an iron-like defense posture. At the same time, shift the various defensive measures from the past into a practical direction. The main topics are the completion of factory air defense, the limitation of air raid damage, preparation for post-air raid measures, and the promotion of evacuation. The Air Defense General Headquarters will then prepare and decide on its specific plan, because it has already convened a meeting of the General Headquarters Bureau Chiefs on the night of February 25 to implement it quickly. Four months since the Air Defense General Headquarters began its initiative, with the issue of evacuation as the center, promote recent air defense administration, expand the scope of the revised Air Defense Law, mobilize the entire Bureau, and give full play to the functions of the General Headquarters in all fields of air defense. And to minimize the impact on productivity and the shaking of national life during air raids. Therefore, emphasize the preparation and training for factory air defense facilities and organizations and damage limits, the recovery and repair of damaged objects, food distribution, rescue, and the construction of simple housing. Regarding the evacuation issue, in addition to relocating or removing facilities that do not affect production or vulnerable buildings in terms of air defense, a new method of evacuating general population groups is also being considered in order to achieve results.</p>
<p>Delegation of Authority</p>
<p>Regarding the delegation of central supervision affairs to local areas, the government and each central government agency have agreed on the items to be delegated, and a decision has already been made by the Cabinet. Already over a thousand matters have been delegated from the center to local areas. To further strengthen and activate this, in principle, except for matters that are absolutely necessary, the remaining parts are thoroughly delegated to local authorities or officials. If necessary, the central government only provides general guidelines or handles matters through ex post facto reports. Regarding each matter, the Cabinet and each ministry should decide as soon as possible and implement it as quickly as possible. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, February 27)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Preliminary Thoughts on Reforming the Local Administrative System <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Xinmin</p>
<p>(A) Shortcomings of the Current Provincial and County System</p>
<p>The provincial government is a guiding and supervisory body for local administration. In the past, provincial areas were vast, making thorough supervision difficult. Although there were proposals to reduce their size, they were never implemented. In recent years, administrative supervisory commissioners have been appointed to oversee specific areas. While this has been somewhat effective, there are still many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Provincial governments are not directly involved in executing administrative affairs, so their organizations should not be too large. Currently, the organizational structure of provinces and counties is disproportionately top-heavy, and the concentration of talent in one area is uneconomical.</p>
<p>Provincial departments simultaneously direct county governments, resulting in conflicting instructions from multiple sources, which makes it difficult for county governments to respond. Furthermore, having too many superiors leads to frequent errors, hindering the implementation of county-level administration.</p>
<p>The status and compensation of county magistrates are too low, deterring qualified and capable individuals from taking on the role. Those who do accept the position often have ulterior motives, rendering effective county administration impossible.</p>
<p>The county is the foundation of local administration, and all government orders rely on the direct implementation by the county government. However, the current county government organization is too rudimentary, and the division of labor is insufficient. While the central government is only responsible for design and guidance, effective implementation must occur at the local level. If there is no one specifically responsible at the local level, either matters are ignored or dealt with perfunctorily. As a result, even if the central government strives for effective governance, it is difficult to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>(B) Methods for Reforming the Provincial System</p>
<p>To concentrate power, expedite operations, and save manpower and resources, the organization of the provincial government should be as simple as possible, with all existing departments abolished.</p>
<p>The provincial government should establish the following offices:</p>
<p>First Office: Handles general affairs. Second Office: Handles finance and land administration. Third Office: Handles agriculture, industry, commerce, and cooperation. The provincial governor, acting on orders from the Executive Yuan, manages all provincial administrative affairs.</p>
<p>The provincial government should have a secretary-general and a deputy secretary-general, each, and six to eight counselors.</p>
<p>Each office of the provincial government should have a director and an assistant director. Offices should not issue official documents to external parties.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of a provincial assembly, the provincial government should establish an advisory committee, recruiting local gentry and prominent figures for consultation and advice.</p>
<p>The secretary-general, counselors, office directors, inspectors, and county magistrates should all be selected by the provincial governor and submitted to the central government for appointment.</p>
<p>The provincial governor should also serve as the provincial security commander, responsible for provincial security and anti-banditry affairs. They may also establish a security command and provincial security teams. The commander should have a chief of staff and a deputy chief of staff, both of whom should be military personnel.</p>
<p>If the provincial governor is a member of the Kuomintang, they should also serve as the chairman of the provincial party headquarters, with two to four standing committee members appointed by the central government.</p>
<p>(C) Methods for Reforming the System of Administrative Supervisory Commissioners</p>
<p>The title "Administrative Supervisory Commissioner" seems cumbersome and should be changed to "Inspector," which is simpler and more respectful.</p>
<p>Each inspector should oversee a district of three to four counties. Overseeing too many counties would make management impossible and render the position useless.</p>
<p>The counties under the jurisdiction of each inspector should be specified in their title. For example, if the district includes Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, and Jurong, the inspector should be called "Zhen-Dan-Jin-Ju District Inspector," which is clearer than "District No. X."</p>
<p>The status and compensation of inspectors should be equivalent to that of the original department directors. After the abolition of the original departments, the department directors should be transferred to the position of inspector, which would be a win-win situation.</p>
<p>The inspector's office should establish the following groups:</p>
<p>First Group: Handles general affairs. Second Group: Handles education, propaganda, the New Life Movement, social affairs, customs, and hygiene. Third Group: Handles finance, land administration, transportation, water conservancy, forestry, economic affairs, and cooperation. Fourth Group: Handles police administration, baojia, and anti-banditry.</p>
<p>Inspectors, acting on orders from the provincial governor, supervise the administration of their entire district.</p>
<p>Inspectors may also serve as county magistrates, using the performance of their county as a model for other counties.</p>
<p>Inspectors should also serve as district security commanders, responsible for security and anti-banditry in their entire district. All security and anti-banditry affairs should be handled by the fourth group of the inspector's office. A separate district security command should not be established, but district security teams may be established.</p>
<p>(D) Methods for Reforming the County System</p>
<p>The official rank of county magistrates should be universally raised to "Simplified Appointment," and their status should be equivalent to that of the provincial government office directors. In addition to their salaries, their official expenses and confidential funds should be stipulated.</p>
<p>As the county is the foundation of local administration, the county government organization should be complete, and the division of labor must be meticulous. As times evolve and administrative affairs become more complex, a rudimentary organization is insufficient. Therefore, the county government should establish the following sections: 1. General Affairs Section, 2. Finance Section, 3. Land Administration Section, 4. Economic Section One, 5. Economic Section Two, 6. Public Works Section, 7. Water Conservancy and Forestry Section, 8. Education Section, 9. Propaganda and New Life Movement Section, 10. Social Affairs and Customs Section, 11. Hygiene Section, 12. Police Administration Section, 13. Baojia Section, 14. Security Section.</p>
<p>The county magistrate, acting on orders from the provincial governor, manages all administrative affairs of the county and is subject to the guidance and supervision of the inspector.</p>
<p>The district chiefs, police station chiefs, tax office chiefs, relief home directors, and school principals should all be selected by the county magistrate and submitted to the provincial government for appointment.</p>
<p>The county magistrate should also serve as the county security commander, responsible for security and anti-banditry in the entire county. All security and anti-banditry affairs should be handled by the security section of the county government. A separate command should not be established, but county security teams may be established.</p>
<p>If the county magistrate is a member of the Kuomintang, they should also serve as the chairman of the county party headquarters, and the remaining committee members should be appointed by the provincial party headquarters.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of a county assembly, the county government should establish a consultation committee, recruiting local gentry and prominent figures for consultation and advice.</p>

<p>The Old Zhabei District of this city has previously established modified procedures for residents to register new households and report changes of address, in order to facilitate household matters. As residential certificates are now being reissued, it is feared that citizens may not be fully aware of the procedures. Therefore, Sub-Bureau Chief Hong Hanbin has reissued an announcement stating: "Since the implementation of the Baojia system in this district, household registration has been conducted to eliminate hiding places for criminals. For the past two years, banditry has been suppressed, and citizens have been able to live and work in peace. However, household registration is based on citizen certificates. In some cases, people coming to Shanghai from inland areas have not prepared the necessary movement procedures and are unable to obtain citizen certificates. Others have taken their citizen certificates with them when returning to their hometowns, creating obstacles for registration. To facilitate household matters, if the above situations occur, the head of the household, the head of the Jia, or the Bao chief can provide certification for registration purposes. This has been the practice, and as residential certificates are now being reissued, it is feared that citizens may still not be aware of the modified procedures. This announcement is hereby reissued to ensure that all residents comply."</p>

<p>Mr. Shen Enfu, also known as Shen Xinqing, passed away yesterday at the age of 81. Mr. Shen was a Xiucai during the late Qing dynasty. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as the Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council and founded the Jiangsu Education Association, dedicating his life to education and cultural endeavors. In his later years, he oversaw the Humanistic Library and the Hongying Library. He was proficient in classical studies, especially the Book of Changes, and was skilled in poetry and calligraphy. When Mr. Shi Liangcai, the late general manager of this newspaper, first took charge, he relied heavily on Mr. Shen's support. Later, he edited "Common Knowledge," which greatly enhanced its reputation. The passing of this venerable senior is deeply mourned. His eldest son, Shen Yougan, who studied in the United States and holds a doctorate in psychology, serving as a professor at various universities, was at his side.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Municipal Advisory Committee <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the Municipal Government of this city will convene a Municipal Advisory Committee in the coming days to jointly discuss the advancement of the new Shanghai. We believe that this is a sincere expression of the Municipal Authorities' desire to engage with citizens, and also a starting point for the Municipal Authorities to establish a representative body. It is a commendable and wise move.</p>
<p>This newspaper has consistently advocated for the establishment of a representative body for over a year. We believe that national rejuvenation requires political reform. Political reform requires the establishment of a representative body. Therefore, this newspaper has repeatedly emphasized this point. In our editorial on March 17, we still advocated for the speedy establishment of a representative body as an important task in reforming Shanghai, on par with streamlining personnel and unifying the economy. In the past week, the Municipal Government appointed Wu Songgao as the head of the First District Public Office and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and appointed Tai Jiandong as the Director of the Security Department and Director of the Anti-Banditry Bureau. This is the beginning of streamlining personnel. Now, with the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, this is the beginning of establishing a representative body. At the same time, it is also the beginning of reforming Shanghai and building a new Shanghai. We, standing from the perspective of citizens, support the development and implementation of these wise measures. In addition to making every effort to cooperate, we will wait and see the results.</p>

<p>Children's Day Special - Part Two</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Big Family of Orphans - A Tour of the Shanghai Fu You Home <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Tucked away in a corner of Dongjiadu in Nanshi, in a large open space, the big family for wandering children – the Shanghai Fuyou Home – is located at one end of this space. Its history is only two years and three months, but the internal facilities and layout are beyond imagination.</p>
<p>The children here are partly referred by the Children's Protection Section and partly those who are seen on the streets and are homeless but can still be developed. They are brought back at any time.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Mr. Dong is a person who is enthusiastic about childcare. He loves the children very much, and the children are also very close to him. When I went there, there was a group of older children talking closely together. When they saw Mr. Dong, they all bowed politely. Their clothes were very neat, and their faces were quite upright. It is said that they were originally orphans adopted here. Now they have been introduced to studies outside. Today is Children's Day, and they have specially come back to see their younger siblings and also to see their kind Mr. Dong. They have all recognized this place as their second home.</p>
<p>The spaciousness of the buildings is their characteristic. The entire home currently has 230 children. It is said that if funding is available, it would be no problem to adopt 500 children. There are nine large bedrooms, all with tatami mats on the floor. Large red blankets are spread on the floor of the room, and the quilts are folded neatly to one side. Young children sleep in the same room with their caregivers. Those with skin diseases and illnesses are separated into two rooms. There is a medical room with simple medical equipment and a female nurse. The children's toothbrushes and cups are placed on a numbered wooden rack. Their clothes and bags are hung in a room, also numbered and not chaotic. The indoor and outdoor areas are swept and kept very clean. These are all done by the children themselves.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Life</p>
<p>The daily routine has a fixed schedule. The lifestyle also adopts a work-study system. However, lower grade children attend classes all day. Only middle and high grade children implement half-work and half-care. There are four workshops: sewing, painting, woodworking, and shoemaking. All are working, and some have experts to guide them. There are four classrooms and a large playground. There are seven teachers and the curriculum is entirely elementary school based.</p>
<p>In terms of food, there are two porridges and one meal. The porridge is made with rice and potatoes. The side dishes are vegetables and tofu. There is a serving of tofu as a snack every afternoon. Children with poor health are given two eggs per meal, and those who are weaker are given one egg per day.</p>
<p>The home's expenses are around 150,000 yuan per month, which entirely relies on social donations. Here, they feel that reading materials for the children, medical supplies, and recreational toys are lacking and needed. They hope that enthusiastic people in the community will donate as much as they can. Any amount is welcome.</p>
