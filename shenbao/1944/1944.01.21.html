<h3>社評　國府當前的急務</h3>
<p>日本讀賣報知一月十日社論，對於國民政府當前的急務，提出「增加生產一最為迫要。而以物價不斷騰貴，使民生不能安定，足爲生產之障碍。其結論以增產決定戰爭，所以在戰爭的現階段，增產是絕對的命令，而為增產障碍的物價問題，民生間題，應特加考慮，日本爲這目的，不惜予以協助。（見今日本報第一版）</p>
<p>我們對這問題的觀點，正復相同，且曾一再論列，獻言當局。去年九月十七日社評，論國民經濟復興問題時，曾提出先決條件在於人民生活得到安定，人民以生活為第一義，如果生活未能安定，必悉其精力營營於生活安定的獲得，談不到生活以外的問題，所以，除非人民生活先得到了起碼的安定，然後責以協力經濟事業，才會有效。所以，經濟制度單獨的力量，不能全部挽救經濟上的危機，必須輔以政治上的革新，才能使經濟制度發揮充分的效用。</p>
<p>目前民生問題怎樣呢？自然談不到「安定」，物價騰貴不已，使人人悉其精力營營於生活安定的獲得。於是國家經濟事業，增加生產計劃，未能得到協力，農工事業之生產，不但不能增加，抑且减低。就去年上海工業同志會調查各業開工率如次：</p>
<p>這裏要說明兩點：一爲上述統計，乃就日方各廠開工率而編製的，華方各廠的開工率都因原料不足，較此更低。二為此表所根據的，係去年一月間的情形，目前原料恐慌比常時爲甚，故開工率當更爲低下。另一方面，政府實施戰時經濟統制制度，只注重於收購與配給，本來統制工作應包括生產收購與分配三項，而收購與分配還是治標的消極工作，唯有加緊生產，才是治本的積極工作。可是，現在統制機構祇及於收購與配給，况且收購工作又未能臻於完全合理，反足以影響减低生產。譬如收購米糧，收購官價，農民未必能實際到手，其結果頗足影警下年度的米糧產量。一方面提出增加生產的口號，而一方面却執行减低生產的方法，這是絕矛盾的現象。</p>
<p>綜上論列，我們認為問題的焦點，還是在於政治，必須從速革新，才能配合經濟問題而得到解決。增加生產固然是經濟問題，而阻礙增產的物價問題，安定民生問題，就必須同時運用政治力量，所以政治的革新與修明，自然必要了。目前中國需要的是實踐政治家，脚踏實地的執行增產計劃，同時，盟邦給予我們技術上的協力，尤其希望把握這一要點。只憑經濟制度與經濟政策本身，決不能全部挽救經濟上的危機，全部解決經濟問題，必須同時運用革新政治，修明政治的力量，才能使經濟制度經濟政策獲致充分的效用。這是我們不　重複而迫切提出的要求。</p>
<h3>各金融機關放款　須用於生產事業　周財政部長昨日發表談話</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電中國參戰已進人第二年，所負之責任愈益重大，國民政府爲厲行其任務，已定今年爲增產年，全國經濟委員會亦决定增產具體方針，復値舊歷歲末，一般金融異常安定，訊者因周副院長曾代汪主席主持第三次經濟會議，又係全國金融界最高當局，爲明瞭今後財政金融之進行，特往趨訪，當蒙延見，並發表談話如下：</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭已進入第三年，中國參戰亦步入第二年，東亞各國在完遂戰爭建設東亞之工作，已較前更應努力，中國爲大東亞戰爭後方之重鎭，爲東亞經濟之樞紐，所負之責任，應做之工作，俱極繁重。</p>
<p>主席指示今年爲增產年，全國經濟委員會第三次會議已决定各種增產方案，均將次第付諸實施，全國上下如能循此計劃勞力邁進，不僅中國之經濟建設可以完成，大東亞戰爭之勝利、更獲得確實之把握，所望社會會界人十，遵照政府政策，切實屬行，以減少建設之阻力，增進建設之功效。復次時値舊歷年關，各地金融異常安定，足微政府之財政金融政策，已有良好效果，此爲以往所少有者。惟揆諸往例，每逢舊歷年關過後，各種物價即有一度上漲，此中原因，一由於各銀行錢莊節前收到之資金，缺乏適當之支配，大　放出，致使游資充斥，羣趨於投機囤貨，一由於不正當商人，企岡非法暴利，操縱屠奇，現在年關瞬將屆臨，舊歷年過後，或不免有囤積現象，刺激物價，希望各金融機關，愼重放款，務使放出之款，用於生產事業，旣可安定物價，又可促進生產同時各界民衆，應儘量一即約，厲行貯蓄，積少成多，以充實建設資金，擴大生產範圍，一般商人更應體念政府意旨，及人民生計，勿貪圖暴利囤積居奇。倘仍有金融機關，濫放款項，不正常商人。高抬物價，政府必將予以嚴厲之制裁，蓋非此不足以安定民生，保障治安。</p>
<h3>企業公司趨向投機　影響金融巿塲　實部負責人發表談話</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電實業部因邇來各地游資與各經營地產買賣及投資企業等公司，均趨向投機交易，刺激物價上漲，影響整個金融市塲，該部負責人特發表談話如後，查各地游資多爲競投機事業，以致刺激市價，擾亂金融巿塲，而各經營地產買賣及投資企業等公司，亦多趨向於機交易，　至巿塲動　，每出常軌，此類公司之新設者，更如進，並謀導游資於正軌，以充實增產計，特定自本年一月二十二日起，凡屬經營地產買賣或一般投責，而業務範圍廣泛如企業投資等公司，除經本部查明，有特別需要及確無投機性質，特許設立者外，一律暫時停止新設，其於一月二十二日以前已經呈請登記，或經呈請騐資或經舉行創立會者，均得通融予以考慮，庶於防範投機事業之中，仍顧全商人之困難，此項辦法，頃已分電各省市經濟局遵照辦理。深望商民共體斯旨，各將資本投於增產谷業，切勿經營投機性質之公司，致遭損失云。</p>
<h3>社會福利部　組織略變更　最高國防會議昨通過</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電本（二十）日最高國防會議舉行第三八次會議，通過耍案，摘錄如左：　通過秘書處案呈准中央政治委員會秘書廳檢送奉交行政院，呈爲木院第一九三次愈議修正通過社會福利部呈送中央公務員特種保險暫行條例。　通過據中央政治委員會委員兼社會福利部部長丁默邨　呈，關於社會福利部之組織及職掌，擬依左列原則略予變更，　社會福利部今後以實施社會政策，推行福利事業爲主要職責，關於民衆政治指導其性質有近於新國民運動劃歸新國民運　促進委員會　管，俾利進行，而一事權，至社會福利部原設之民衆政治指導署，予以撤消，　社會福利部另設置人口署，將原有體力司併入，參照日本厚生省人口局之規定，職掌大略如左：（甲）人口增殖及改良事項，（乙）民族優生及營養事項，（丙）國民健康事項，（丁）國民體力事項，（戊）國民婚姻事項，（己）其他有關人口事項</p>
<h3>淮海保安司令　郝鵬舉兼任</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電國府令（一月二十日）據軍事委員會委員長呈據陸軍部部長葉逢呈，爲河南省省長田文炳，此次奉令招募新兵二千名，早期辦竣，業於本月十九日按數運送到京，且新兵素質亦均良好，似此辦事認價，擬請明令嘉獎，以昭激勵等情，該省長此次招募新兵，辦理有方，對於建軍，實多盡力，應特予嘉獎，此令。又國民政府令，一月二十日任命郝鵬舉兼淮海省保安司令此令</p>
<h3>渝西北地區　開軍政會議</h3>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電重慶消息，渝西北地區軍政會議，於十四日在第八戰區司令部舉行，會期三日，通過改善軍需接濟問題等案二十餘件，該會已於十六日閉幕。聞該會之中心議題，似爲應付中共問題，蓋渝方前曾於十一中全會發表對中共宜言後，中共方面幷未表示任何正式意見，反而積極推進反蔣工作，幷努力擴充軍備，渝方有鑑於此，欲加以壓制，幷爲指示西北各將領起見，故有此次渝軍之行動，殊堪注目。</p>
<h3>譯評　國府當前的急務</h3>
<p>自近衛聲明以來，經過了中日基本條約的締結，去年一月的對華新政策之實施，以至於去年秋中日同盟條約的簽訂，日本對中國的獨立表示滿腔的誠　與努力；中國也發奮自强，致力於增强國力，以副日本的誠意·關於日本的對華政策，最近在重慶及英美有種種論調。但我們看日本從明治以來對華觀念的變遷時，明治十年以來的民間志士，例如大井憲太郞。山本梅崖，小林橦椎等，及辛亥革命前後的宮崎，山田兄弟其他許多志士，均冀求中國的强大與獨立，又如平野國臣，木戶孝允，勝海舟，岩倉具視等，也主張中國的獨立與中日提携；大隈重信，近衛篤磨也發表同樣的主張；松方正義在致寺內伯的信裏，也論列中國獨立的重要。所以自近衛聲明以來，日本所闡明的對華政策，乃是基於維新以來的傳統方針、評論日本最近的對華政策之種種論調，不過是替英美作巧妙的宣傳而已、</p>
<p>現在中國的獨立，獲得千載一時的良機而即將實現，這是中日兩國之歷史的冀求。要達到這冀求，大中亞戰爭的勝利是絕對的條件。國民政府不顧其成立的時日尙淺，而毅然於去年一月對英美宣戰　加强對日本的協力者，也無非欲獲得這絕對條件。宣戰一年來的國府，正傾其全部力量、向此目的邁進中。</p>
<p>參戰以來中國的施政方針，注主席曾列爲確立治安，增强生產，昂揚國民戰時意識三點，然而鑒於目前戰局的迫切情勢，其主點不能不最先是增强生產以增加戰力。最必要的是飛機，軍艦，大砲。從這意義上出發，中國之爲兵站基地的責任，遂愈趨重大。華北，蒙疆的鐵，煤及其他重工業資源，華中的農產物，是中國所能貢獻的戰力資源，目前决戰局勢下最迫切的要求。就是這一方面的全部動員。</p>
<p>但我們想在這裏指出，現在華中華北物價的昂騰，實是橫在這迫切要求之前的極大障碍·華北的牧價，自去年春統制物價以後，至六月而漸趨跌落，但至十月又開始急漲，以至今日。華中方面，以去年一月與八月此較起來，漲了三·四倍其後續漲不已，入十二月以後，其騰漲率更爲可驚，而且其特質爲統制價格校自由價格漲得更高，及生活必需品騰漲的高速率。</p>
<p>增强生產决不單是數字上面的計算，和表面上的設立機構。乃是實際生產直接可變成戰力的物資。然而這實際生產祇有在複雜的關係下方才可能。尤其像中國這地方，實施統制經濟的條件不完備，因而不能不預先想到意料中的困難。</p>
<p>物價的騰貴，不僅妨害生產的設計上，資材的獲得上，生產物的運輸上之圓滑性，且因而釀成民生的不安，間接成爲對於生產的障碍。</p>
<p>在戰爭的現階段，增產是絕對命令。增產决定戰爭。日本現在正克服所有困難，向增產邁進中，其自主獨立係於大東亞戰爭的中國，當前急務，不能不以增產爲最先。如以過去一年爲參戰態勢的生長期，則未來的一年應該是以整備就緒的態勢直向增產邁進·因此，對於為其障碍的物價問題，民生問題，不能不特別加以考慮。日本爲了這目的，不惜予以協助；但同時也必須想到另一個政治的原因，即中國物價的昂騰，是戰局的推移所造成的。（翔：譯自一月十日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>議論集中建設方面</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日第八十四屆通常議會定二十一日再開，日政府與議會間將展開活潑之議論。按自大柬亞戰爭勃發以來，召開議會計達七次，每次議會均以完成戰爭，擎滅英·美爲目的，分別完成重要使命，發揮日官民一體之成果。此次議會賓即爲完成必勝體制具有歷史性之重要議會，日政府將與議會渾然一體，眞擎討論，適應現下戰局整備必勝態勢，發揮一億國民總力之施策，故日政府已有愼重準備。豫定提出之三十二法案，已於十九日對貴·衆兩院全部提出，更於二十日之提前閣議中，决定首相·外相·藏相之演說草案及追加時虛心傾聽議會具有建設性之議論，俾收獲戰時議會之成果。議會方面為建成此次議會所負之市大使命，乃與翼贊會愼重研究議事方法，决使議會之　論集中於建設方而，即於此種方針下，銓衡豫草委員及各委員會，委員以下情上達方式，貢獻於政府之施策，故此次議會中，議會方面之議論，將集中於實現决戰國　方面。對外以建設大東亞、加强日·德信賴，暴露英·美戰爭目的的無意義等為中心，內則着重增產飛機·煤·鐵·石油等基礎資材，　保食糧，加强輸送力，國民勤勞動員，展開國民運動及刷新戰時國民生活等國內態勢。强化方策方面，以確立日　億國民戰鬥配置之態勢。</p>
<h3>緬甸邊境日軍　進攻敵陣地</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　新德里來電，東南亞細亞軍司令部十七日發表阿拉坎戰綫之戰况如下：瑪由丘陵地帶西方之日軍，對反軸心軍據有之二村莊。曾以戰鬥偵察機隊加以攻繫，</p>

<h3>冒險進犯歐陸　必自食其果　郭培爾對英警吿</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　據海通社訊：一德國週報，刋載郭培爾一文、蘭解反軸　軍進犯歐陸之冒險及其影響。據稱，德軍長官對敵軍進犯之企圖，已採取一切必要措施，敵人亦知大舉進犯西歐，為最危險之行動，英美　作孤注一擲，一擲而不中，則將居下風而不免戰敗矣。迄今英美僅調遣一部軍隊作戰，倘若大舉進犯西歐，則非出其全力不可。英美旣不知德軍之實力　何，戰略爲何，冒昧進攻豈非冒險，况西歐德軍，自一九四〇年迄今，未遇强敵，實力充足，又有以逸待勞之利乎。德蘇開戰以還，德人早有戒心，時時慮及敵軍由大西洋海岸進犯之行動。郭氏透露德軍有使用新武器之可能，敵人必不免遭遇龐大之損失，可斷言也。且德空軍與陸軍必與敵惡戰火併，其猛烈或爲前此所未見焉。英人高呼「進犯歐陸必不可失敗，」足微英人瞭解此役之嚴重矣。更有一事爲英人及世人所不容忍視者，英倫三島僅有四千萬之人口生殖率，且有日減之勢，進攻歐陸之行動，損兵折將倘若過多，將何以補救之乎。作繭自縛，作孽自受，英終須淸償其孽偵也。</p>

<h3>戶口煤球　正設法增配　華北運滬煤斤日見增加</h3>
<p>中央社訊本市煤斤前因來源稀少，致被投機囤積者操縱，市價飛漲，釀成燃料恐慌。茲經有關富局嚴密取締統制，並疏通來源，實施配給後，市價即見止漲，人心亦稍安定。茲悉石炭聯合會爲努力抑平燃料恐慌，恢復煤斤供給過去之原狀起見，特由該會大橋局長，親赴華北產煤區，向常局接洽疏通，及採辦大量煤斤來滬。據中央社記者頃向大中聯煤號探悉：最近由華北陸續運滬煤斤，數量日見增加，存底極爲豐富，配給各製球廠原料，頗爲充足，煤球生產增多，第一區公署經濟處正設法增加煤球配給數量中。</p>
<p>工廠用煤準備配給</p>
<p>一月份工廠用煤七千噸，大中聯煤號已在準備配給手續。又水汀用煤大中聯與石炭聯合會取得相常煤斤，現正待一區公署許可證發下、即可照發。至於浴室用煤，當局已允許配給，惟因浴業公會造具會員名冊，手續遲緩，故無從根據立時配給，一俟該會會員名冊送齊後，即行如數配給需用，是以今後本市煤斤供給，常可無處缺乏。</p>

<h3>反軸心國間　已暴露裂痕　廣田情報部長談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊日本大使館廣田情報部長，昨（二十）日下午三時，在華懋飯店八樓，循例會見本市記者，席上就目前世界局勢，發表談話，對反軸心國英美與蘇聯政治軍事等政策之相互矛盾，闡述極爲詳盡，茲誌其談話如次：</p>
<p>第二戰綫英美消極</p>
<p>自去秋德黑蘭會談以後，即傳出「反軸心方面，英美蘇渝四國之間。已達到完全諒解，」「反軸心英美將結成第二戰綫於歐洲大陸。展開對德之　攻擊，對太平洋方面，則將加强對日之攻擎之計劃」。然觀諸實際情形，反軸心國之間，無論政治軍事經濟各方面，完全不能趨於一致。實際英美國內對此第二戰綫問題，發生劇烈反對運動，因此英美對結成第二戰綫之態度極為消極。所以蘇聯對英美之消極態度，現正極度憂慮，英美於北菲西西里南部意大得等，毫無防禦設備之地登陸，遭受重大損失，何况此次英美企圖在法國巴爾幹登陸，德方早有準備，防禦堅强，則其將蒙受極大損失，自可預測。英美自一九四四—一九四五一年內，兵員之損失、其數將在三百萬以上，實屬毫無意義，國內民衆，亦逐漸明瞭，反對自富逐漸劇烈，兩國政府實遭極大困難。</p>
<p>政治意見難期一致</p>
<p>共產主義勢力之於歐洲逐漸擴大，英美表示意見不能一致，英國尤其反對蘇共產主義之勢力南下。美國雖曾說明，共產主義並非爲威脅世界之主義，但其國民咸不能承認，故英美蘇三國間政治上意見之不能一致，巳暴露無餘。同時共產主義之勢力向歐洲大陸之逐漸伸張，已使英美感覺其威脅之危險，致促英美對蘇之關係，回復至過去對敵之時代。對此種情形，軸心同爲擊減敵方之攻擊力起見，巳確立完善準備，不論戰爭於何時結束對最後勝利確具把握。</p>

<p>中央社訊　中華醫學會上海支會，上海特別市醫師公會，及上海公私立醫院聯合會，昨（二十日）午十二時假外灘興亞大樓工商聯誼會會議廳，設宴招待本市新聞界同人，計到本市各醫院院長，及著名醫師顧南羣，顏福慶，余雲岫，注企張，湯于翰，朱仰高等，新聞界同人計到陳彬龢，楊迥浪，陳英，丘石木，任雲鵬等三十餘名。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>首由主席代表顧南羣起立致詞：略謂今日承諾君踴躍責臨，本會等深以爲幸，諸君爲輿論之權威，在社會人羣主於領導，本人及醫界同人莫不非常欽敬。最近社會上醫　界恒有與病家方面發生糾紛、此種情形，醫界方面雖不能謂無有過失，但病家之不明事理者，爲數亦多，故有誤會之發生，而我人爲醫者，當爲服務人羣厥盡天職，决不因目見病家危於眉睫而不捨救之，如今社會因糾紛案件之多，醫界同人蒙受其害，影響非淺，為糾正此項情形及防止此風助長起見，特由三會聯合組織「醫士糾紛硏究會」，以硏究糾紛情由及起因，該會組織，請由本市名醫及各科專家負責處理云云。</p>
<p>糾紛影響</p>
<p>繼由余雲岫氏就醫學方面解說綦詳，旋田顏福慶氏致詞：謂此次紀紛情形，不但影響我醫界同人，而足以影響社會非淺。惟醫界方面雖服務人羣為天職，但不免有投機假名醫士混雜其間，是以在醫界方面，須有整理之必要。此外並在一八二區及滬西等平民區域，劃定為書騐區，今已選定徐家匯鎭大西路等處、着手進行平民衛生工作，以本醫生對社會服務之旨願，以及灌輸普及醫學常識正富觀念。最後又解說病理情由頗多。</p>

<p>國民論壇西藥廠應有的改善  滸敏　　自從大東亞戰事爆發以來，西藥來源斷絕，國製西藥業，一時頗見蓬勃之象。　　但是，假使開了廠，因爲用人不當，或者「人員不能盡其才，器具不能盡其用，」以致出品不良，或者出品減少，那末，對於該廠的壽命，不是很可慮的嗎。筆者頤就見聞所及向主持藥廠諸公進一言：　　普通廠家，招募起人員來，都是以有經騐爲先决條件，但是，筆者以爲有經騐的人，假設沒有精益求精的進取毅力，那末他的工作價値，比有精益求精的毅力，而無經騐的人更低，因爲後者雖無經騐，但是，只憑了他這些進取的毅力，將來一定會比前者，更有技能，更有經騐的。　　有些廠家，以爲新進的人員，都是沒有學識的，所以給他們所做的工作是瑣碎的，無意味的，並且，因爲他們是新進，所以不給他們有任何發言權，筆者有個堂兄弟，他會在某小型藥廠裏做練習生，據他說，每天早晨替化學師做着洗瓶，拿東西，裝儀器，拆儀器等等的工作，這樣一天到晚，從不休息，從不更換的做着。有時，他覺得化學師所做的，有些不合理。可是，他是一個新進的練習生，被化學師以爲「左右也不過是個中學畢業生，有多大學識呢。」的人，當然不敢發言，且也不能發言，等到廠長以爲出品太慢，或者出品不良，而延長工作時間，其間吃虧的還不是練習生而是誰呢。　　些藥廠，時常濫用儀器，譬如一根剛才通過氯氣的管子，放在架子上的人，毫不擦洗毫不檢騐的，拿去作過瀘用了，試問這樣瀘出來的東西會良好嗎？還有些人，用了巨大的抽氣機，去供直徑不滿四厘米的瓷杯作過瀘用，其實，這樣一隻瓷杯所需的抽氣力，和一　長橡皮管作虹吸時，所產生的吸力一樣，何必拿巨大的抽氣機來「大才小用」呢。　　筆者也會參觀一家藥廠，該樂廠裏面裝着一架精細的抽氣機，其刻度，可謂至〇·二五吋的水銀桂盡力，可是，這架精細的機器，並不作精細的工作，而作不須精確抽氣度的過濾用。筆者偏見，以爲在原動力昂貴的今日，不妨把這種用電力推動的機器，易爲手搖的機器，其構造可仿照蒸汽機而約略加以改造，致於易漏氣的部份，可以用價廉的軟墊料來防止，這樣一來，假設汽缸有效容積爲五千CC效力爲六十％計，那末活塞來回一次，就有壓力爲四十五·六贅米水銀柱高，容積爲一萬CC的眞空來供給應用了，假使每秒鐘要用一百CC，那末也可以有一又三分之二分鐘可用，這些壓力，這些時間，也足够過濾所需要的了。　　還有些廠家，在蒸餾沸點較低的液體時—如酒精Alcohol醚Ether或者阿息通Aceton，因爲恐怕牠們發生爆炸、所以，特地備了一個水浴WaterBath，專由一個人管理溫度，一個人調換熱水，這樣的蒸餾，不但耗費人力，而且溫度也未必穩定，因爲調換熱水時，其問溫度相差，常在六七度—攝氏表—之間，有多至十幾度者，依筆者的偏見，不妨用水浴隔火蒸之，如恐着火，則可沿照煤礦工人所用的安全燈一樣，在火的四周用傳熱優良的安全網來遮住，在隔有整個冷凝器Condenser，那末長一段距離的承受器Receiver裏，所盛的藥品，無論共如何容易爆炸，在這樣的裝置之下，的確可以無庸操心了，如此一來，非惟人力可省，而且溫度可保穩定—因煤氣燈可調節溫度的。　　凡此種種，都希望藥廠當局，加以改善。海軍  岩田豐雄著洪羊譯立志（十）　　（决斷，是最重要的事…）　　蔭摩和江戶的海軍前輩，毅然地採取了英國式，這種决斷，在國家百　之後，有了這樣輝煌的業蹟，眞人是不勝感激的，但是回想到自己本身的現狀，實在是慚愧無地。　　（我還沒决定入陸軍士官學校，或海軍官兵學校。）　　雖然巳經决心將來要當軍人，但還沒有具體的决斷。在日本是沒有只是一個軍人的名稱·不是船錨的軍人，就是星薇的軍人。　　（好了，今天就要决定一下。）　　巳經不是可以蹉跎歲月的年齡了　在那本書上不是寫着，柬鄉也是在十七歲就出征了麼？　　他把書還給圖書館的館員，就高聳着肩膀，出了閱覽室·是穿着制服和木屐來的，所以在鞋櫃還須要換上草鞋的。　　「谷君，你也到圖畫館來了麼：」並不十分要好的，同級的朋友尾崎，在出口這樣的喊　　「哼！你在那兒做甚麼哪？」　　「下雨天、也沒帶傘來。」　　的確是，外邊下着很大的雨·　　「那麼，到我的傘下來吧！」　　一向未雨綢繆的眞人，恰巧帶着一柄洋傘。　　二人合撐着傘，日着大風雨中，從照國神社前走到天文館路去。　　「雨傎大啊！」尾崎渾身稀濕，把褲脚捲到膝蓋上·似絞手巾般，水在足脛上流着。　　眞人看也不看一眼，昂然走着。實在說，什麼風雨，都已忘記了。　　中原猶介出身薩摩……赤塚，伊東，仁禮，川村，榫山，山本，及東鄕，都川身薩摩。他一心只想着那些事。　　「谷君……往那裏去？」尾崎走到天文館路的電軍道，向還在向前走着的眞人說話了。在那裏等車，有電車直達他倆所住的地方，不用中途換車。　　傎人出其不意地被提醒了，舉目四顧，滿天狂風暴雨。薩摩地方獨有的暴雨，從灰黑的空中，像盛開的花朶般，在路上澆洒着，電綫被狂風吹得許許地直呌。一切都彷彿像薩英戰爭的第一天。　　「尾崎君，走啊……不要乘電車！」眞人一直走過電車道。那時他的心裏，恰似在開始發動什麼似的、尾崎莫明其妙，略帶一點不平，跟在眞人的傘下。　　社會服務已立立人　苦學生捐款助學　　練水潘生，家貧，卒業初中，來滬爲商店學徒，勤愼服務，暇則閱書，數年不廢，大爲店主所器車，潘生終自慊學識不足，立志入進修夜校補習國文，簿記兩科，以求深造，悉心聽講，有疑必問；準時上課，風雨無間；課卷繕寫整潔，一字不有，其求學之肫摯，迥異擠輩。頃者，潘生　於各校將於下期大加學費，頗爲不勝負擔者憂，乃出其所儲三百金，陳諸主校者請增免費學額二名，主校者嘉其志，即揭示以俟淸寒學于之申請焉。孔子云：「已欲立而立人」，若潘生者，良可風已。（從樞）麵食同業　分發食品　　上海麵製食品業同業公會鑒於難民孤兒殘廢及隱貧階級，生活困難，常茲隆冬，呼籲無門，特商得該業會員同意，自動捐送大批麵製搶餅饅頭等食品·昨日上午該會理事長王秉特派姚金標戴子泉二代表，親赴南市國貨路新普育堂，當即捐送麵製品五百斤，繼赴上海殘廢院，捐送麵製品一百斤，今日繼續赴其他救濟團體捐送，以惠貧民。　　求學良機　　第一區公署社會利處，設立工人技術專修夜校於東西二處，東校在荆州路一〇〇號市立荆州路小學內，西校在馬白路二十五號市立模範中學內，該校每星期上課三次，下學期機械及電機科一二年級及預備班之揷班生，即日起開始報名，索章可向福州路一八〇號三樓三七七號A室。　　格致理學學社，係光華大學理商兩學院同人所創辦，地址在成都路二七〇號，每學期分兩期上課，學生所修學分，均得請求光華大學承認，並發給證書，第十二期定二月一日至三日註冊，四日上課，並招收新生，及挿班生，即日起報名。　　　中靑工業講座　上海靑年會定於本星期六下午三時在八仙橋總會大禮堂，舉行第二次工業講座，由新亞酵素廠總工程師陳　聲博士主講「制糖工業」，歡迎聽講。</p>

        <h1>1944.01.21</h1>
<h3>Editorial: The National Government's Urgent Tasks</h3>
<p>Japan's Yomiuri Hochi newspaper, in its January 10th editorial, proposed that the most pressing task for the National Government is "increasing production." It argued that the continuous rise in prices destabilizes people's livelihoods, hindering production. The conclusion was that production determines the war, and therefore, in the current stage of the war, increasing production is an absolute order. The problems of prices and people's livelihoods, which hinder production, should be given special consideration, and Japan is willing to provide assistance for this purpose. (See the first page of today's newspaper.)</p>
<p>We share the same view on this issue and have repeatedly discussed and advised the authorities. In our editorial on September 17th of last year, when discussing the issue of national economic recovery, we proposed that a prerequisite is the stabilization of people's lives. People prioritize their livelihoods. If their lives are not stable, they will devote all their energy to securing their livelihoods and will not consider matters beyond that. Therefore, unless people's lives are first stabilized, it will be ineffective to expect them to cooperate with economic endeavors. Thus, the independent power of the economic system cannot fully salvage the economic crisis, and it must be supplemented by political reform to allow the economic system to exert its full effect.</p>
<p>What is the current state of people's livelihoods? Naturally, there is no "stability" to speak of. Prices are rising continuously, causing everyone to devote their energy to securing their livelihoods. As a result, national economic endeavors and plans to increase production have not received cooperation. Production in agriculture and industry has not only failed to increase but has also decreased. The Shanghai Industrial Association's survey of the operating rates of various industries last year is as follows:</p>
<p>Here, two points must be clarified: Firstly, the above statistics are based on the operating rates of Japanese factories, while the operating rates of Chinese factories are even lower due to insufficient raw materials. Secondly, the table is based on the situation in January of last year, and the current shortage of raw materials is even more severe than at that time, so the operating rates should be even lower. On the other hand, the government implements a wartime economic control system, focusing only on procurement and distribution. Originally, the control work should include production, procurement, and distribution. However, procurement and distribution are only temporary and passive measures. Only by intensifying production can we achieve a fundamental and active solution. However, the current control mechanism only extends to procurement and distribution, and even the procurement work has not been fully rationalized, which is enough to affect and reduce production. For example, the official procurement price of rice may not actually reach the farmers, which is likely to affect the rice yield in the next year. On the one hand, a slogan of increasing production is put forward, while on the other hand, methods of reducing production are implemented. This is an absolutely contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>In summary, we believe that the focus of the problem still lies in politics. Reform must be carried out as soon as possible to be able to solve the economic problems. Increasing production is certainly an economic problem, but the price problem, which hinders production, and the problem of stabilizing people's livelihoods must be addressed simultaneously with political power. Therefore, political reform and clarification are naturally necessary. What China needs now are practical politicians who implement production increase plans practically. At the same time, we hope that allied countries will provide us with technical assistance, especially grasping this key point. Relying solely on economic systems and economic policies cannot fully salvage the economic crisis or solve economic problems. We must simultaneously use the power of reforming politics and clarifying politics to enable economic systems and economic policies to achieve their full effect. This is our repeatedly and urgently put-forward request.</p>
<h3>Lending by Financial Institutions Must Be Used for Productive Enterprises: Finance Minister Zhou's Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – China's participation in the war has entered its second year, and the responsibilities it bears have become increasingly significant. In order to rigorously carry out its tasks, the National Government has designated this year as the year of increased production. The National Economic Commission has also decided on specific guidelines for increased production. Moreover, as the old lunar year draws to a close, the general financial situation is exceptionally stable. Our reporter, due to the fact that Deputy Premier Zhou once presided over the Third Economic Conference on behalf of Chairman Wang, and is also the highest authority in the national financial community, sought an interview to understand the future direction of finance and economics. He was granted an audience and released the following statement:</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and China's participation in the war has also stepped into its second year. The countries of East Asia should work even harder than before to complete the tasks of war and construction in East Asia. China, as an important stronghold in the rear of the Greater East Asia War and the hub of East Asian economy, bears extremely heavy responsibilities and tasks.</p>
<p>Chairman has instructed that this year is the year of increased production. The Third Conference of the National Economic Commission has decided on various production increase plans, which will be implemented in order. If the entire nation can follow this plan and work hard, not only can China's economic construction be completed, but also the victory of the Greater East Asia War will be more firmly secured. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will follow the government's policies and implement them diligently to reduce obstacles to construction and increase the effectiveness of construction. Furthermore, as the old lunar year is approaching, the financial situation in various places is exceptionally stable, indicating that the government's financial and economic policies have had good results, which has been rare in the past. However, according to past experience, after each old lunar year, various prices tend to rise. One reason for this is that the funds received by various banks and money houses before the festival lack proper distribution, and large amounts are released, causing floating capital to flood the market, leading to speculation and hoarding. Another reason is that unscrupulous merchants seek illegal profits by manipulating and speculating. Now that the end of the year is approaching, hoarding may occur after the old lunar year, stimulating prices. It is hoped that various financial institutions will be cautious in lending, ensuring that the released funds are used for productive enterprises, which can stabilize prices and promote production. At the same time, the general public should save as much as possible and practice thrift to accumulate construction funds and expand the scope of production. Businessmen should also consider the government's intentions and the people's livelihoods, and not be greedy for excessive profits and hoard goods. If there are still financial institutions that indiscriminately lend money and unscrupulous merchants who raise prices, the government will impose severe sanctions on them, because only in this way can people's livelihoods be stabilized and public order be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Companies Tend to Speculate, Affecting the Financial Market: Statement by Responsible Person of the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Because idle funds in various places and companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises have recently tended towards speculative transactions, stimulating price increases and affecting the entire financial market, the responsible person of the Ministry of Industry made the following statement: It has been found that a large amount of idle capital in various places is used for speculative businesses, leading to stimulation of market prices and disruption of the financial market. Moreover, various companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises also tend to engage in speculative transactions, causing market fluctuations to be abnormal. The establishment of new companies of this kind is even more rampant. In order to guide idle capital to the right track and to enrich the plan for increasing production, it is specifically decided that from January 22nd of this year, all companies engaged in real estate trading or general speculative enterprises with a wide range of businesses, such as enterprise investment companies, will be temporarily suspended from being established, unless they have been investigated by this Ministry and found to have special needs and are indeed non-speculative in nature, and are specially permitted to be established. Those who have already applied for registration, applied for capital verification, or held founding meetings before January 22nd will be given consideration to take into account the difficulties of businessmen while preventing speculative businesses. This measure has been telegraphed to the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities for compliance. It is hoped that merchants and people will understand this intention and invest their capital in the cause of increasing production, and must not engage in companies of a speculative nature, resulting in losses.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Ministry of Social Welfare: Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – The 38th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council was held on the 20th of this month, and the following proposals were approved, excerpted as follows: The proposal from the Secretariat was approved, and submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee. The proposal was sent by the Ministry of Social Welfare for amendments to the Provisional Regulations on Special Insurance for Central Civil Servants, which were passed by the 193rd meeting of the Executive Yuan. Approved, according to the proposal submitted by Ding Mocun, Member of the Central Political Committee and Minister of Social Welfare, regarding the organization and functions of the Ministry of Social Welfare, it is proposed to make slight changes according to the following principles: In the future, the main responsibilities of the Ministry of Social Welfare will be to implement social policies and promote welfare undertakings.

The Ministry of Social Welfare will set up a Population Department and incorporate the original Physical Strength Division. Referring to the regulations of the Population Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the functions are roughly as follows: (A) Matters related to population increase and improvement, (B) Matters related to ethnic eugenics and nutrition, (C) Matters related to national health, (D) Matters related to national physical strength, (E) Matters related to national marriage, (F) Other matters related to population.</p>
<h3>Hao Pengju Concurrently Appointed as Commander of the Huaihai Security</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – National Government Order (January 20th): According to the report submitted by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, based on the report submitted by Ye Feng, Minister of the Army, that Tian Wenbing, Governor of Henan Province, was ordered to recruit 2,000 new soldiers this time, and completed it early. They were transported to Beijing on the 19th of this month according to the number, and the quality of the new soldiers was also good. It is proposed to issue a commendation to encourage such diligent work. The Governor of the province has managed the recruitment of new soldiers in a proper manner this time, and has indeed done his best for the building of the army. He should be given special commendation. This order. Also, National Government Order, January 20th, appoints Hao Pengju as Commander of the Huaihai Province Security. This order.</p>
<h3>Military and Political Conference Held in Northwestern Chongqing Area</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Chongqing news: The military and political conference in the northwestern Chongqing area was held at the headquarters of the Eighth War Zone on the 14th, lasting three days. More than 20 cases, including the improvement of military supplies, were passed. The conference closed on the 16th. It is heard that the central issue of the conference seemed to be dealing with the CCP issue. After the Chongqing side had previously issued a statement on the CCP issue at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the CCP side did not express any formal opinions, but instead actively promoted anti-Chiang work and made efforts to expand its military equipment. In view of this, the Chongqing side wanted to suppress it and to give instructions to the generals in the Northwest, so there was this action by the Chongqing army, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Translated Commentary: The National Government's Urgent Tasks</h3>
<p>Since the Konoe Statement, through the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the implementation of the new policy toward China in January of last year, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the autumn of last year, Japan has expressed its full sincerity and efforts for China's independence; China has also strived for self-improvement and devoted itself to enhancing its national strength to live up to Japan's sincerity. Regarding Japan's policy toward China, there have been various arguments recently in Chongqing and the United States and Britain. But when we look at the changes in Japan's views toward China since the Meiji era, civil society figures since Meiji 10, such as Kentaro Oi, Baigai Yamamoto, and Tojū Kobayashi, and the Miyazaki and Yamada brothers and many other figures around the Xinhai Revolution, all hoped for China's strength and independence. Also, figures such as Kuniomi Hirano, Takayoshi Kido, Kaishu Katsu, and Tomomi Iwakura also advocated China's independence and Sino-Japanese cooperation; Shigenobu Okuma and Atsumaro Konoe also expressed the same views; Masayoshi Matsukata also discussed the importance of China's independence in a letter to Count Terauchi. Therefore, the policy toward China articulated by Japan since the Konoe Statement is based on the traditional policy since the Meiji Restoration. The various arguments commenting on Japan's recent policy toward China are merely making clever propaganda for Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Now China's independence has gained a golden opportunity and is about to be realized. This is the historical hope of China and Japan. To achieve this hope, the victory of the Greater East Asia War is an absolute condition. Regardless of its short establishment period, the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States last January to strengthen its cooperation with Japan, which is also nothing more than to obtain this absolute condition. For the past year since the declaration of war, the National Government has been pouring all its strength and moving toward this goal.</p>
<p>Since participating in the war, the guiding principles of China's administration have been listed by President Wang as establishing security, increasing production, and raising the national wartime consciousness. However, in view of the current urgent situation of the war, the main point must first be to increase production to increase combat power. The most necessary things are airplanes, warships, and artillery. From this point of view, China's responsibility as a logistics base has become increasingly important. The iron, coal, and other heavy industrial resources of North China and Mengjiang, and the agricultural products of Central China, are the war resources that China can contribute, which are the most urgent requirements in the current decisive war situation. The most urgent requirement is the full mobilization of this aspect.</p>
<p>But we want to point out here that the high prices in North and Central China are a major obstacle in front of this urgent requirement. The prices in North China gradually declined after the price controls implemented last spring until June, but began to rise sharply again in October and continue to this day. In Central China, compared to January and August of last year, prices have risen three or four times. The price increases continued unabated thereafter, and the rate of increase has been even more alarming since December. Moreover, the characteristic is that the controlled prices have risen even higher than the free prices, and the rate of increase of necessities is high.</p>
<p>Increasing production is definitely not just a numerical calculation and the superficial establishment of institutions. It is a material that can be directly transformed into combat power through actual production. However, this actual production is only possible in complex relationships. Especially in a place like China, the conditions for implementing a controlled economy are not complete, so it is inevitable to anticipate the difficulties that are expected.</p>
<p>The high prices not only hinder the smoothness of production design, the acquisition of materials, and the transportation of products, but also lead to social unrest, which indirectly becomes an obstacle to production.</p>
<p>In the current stage of the war, increasing production is an absolute order. Production determines the war. Japan is now overcoming all difficulties and moving towards increasing production. For China, whose autonomy and independence are dependent on the Greater East Asia War, the most urgent task cannot but be increasing production first. If the past year was the growth period for the war-fighting posture, then the coming year should be to move directly towards increasing production in a well-prepared posture. Therefore, the price problem and the livelihood problem, which are obstacles to it, cannot but be given special consideration. Japan is willing to assist for this purpose; but at the same time, another political reason must be considered, that is, the high prices in China are caused by the progress of the war.

<h3>Japanese Troops on the Burmese Border Attack Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – News from New Delhi: The Southeast Asia Command announced the battle situation on the Arakan front on the 17th as follows: Japanese troops west of the Mayu hills attacked two villages held by anti-Axis forces with combat reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – News from New Delhi: The Southeast Asia anti-Axis Command announced on the 18th that Japanese troops near Maungdaw on the western border of Burma attacked anti-Axis positions twice on the evening of the 15th.</p>
<h3>Adventurous Invasion of Europe Will Inevitably Backfire: Goebbels Warns the British</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Haitong News Agency: A German weekly published an article by Goebbels, analyzing the adventure of the anti-Axis forces invading Europe and its impact. It is reported that the German military commanders have taken all necessary measures against the enemy's attempt to invade. The enemy also knows that a large-scale invasion of Western Europe is the most dangerous action. If Britain and the United States make a desperate bet and fail, they will be at a disadvantage and will inevitably be defeated. So far, Britain and the United States have only dispatched a part of their troops to fight. If they invade Western Europe on a large scale, they will have to use all their strength. Britain and the United States do not know the strength of the German army and what its strategy is. Isn't it adventurous to invade rashly? Moreover, the German troops in Western Europe have not encountered strong enemies since 1940, and their strength is sufficient. They also have the advantage of waiting for work. Since the beginning of the German-Soviet war, the Germans have been vigilant and have always been concerned about the enemy's actions to invade from the Atlantic coast. Goebbels revealed the possibility of the German army using new weapons. The enemy will inevitably suffer huge losses, which can be asserted. Moreover, the German Air Force and Army will fight fiercely with the enemy, and its intensity may be unprecedented. The British shouted "The invasion of Europe must not fail," which shows that the British understand the seriousness of this battle. What's more, there is one thing that the British and the world cannot tolerate. The British Isles have a population of only 40 million, and the birth rate is declining. If the action to invade Europe causes too many casualties, how can it be remedied? They will end up suffering the consequences of their own actions. The British will eventually have to pay for their sins.</p>

<h3>Original Text of Essential Guidelines for the Purchase and Rationing of Materials</h3>
<p>These guidelines are intended to implement the current food and price policies. The rationing of cotton yarn, cloth, and other major materials in various regions focuses on promoting the purchase of agricultural products and aims for organic operation. These guidelines are implemented by the Commerce Control Council, with relevant Sino-Japanese agencies assisting as needed. The implementation period is from November of the Republic of China's 32nd year (1943) to March of the 33rd year (1944). However, these guidelines should be appropriately revised after the overall cotton yarn and cloth rationing plan is finalized. The materials include six types: cotton yarn, cloth, candles, matches, soap, sugar, and cigarettes. A separate plan will be created for the rationing of salt. The materials implemented under these guidelines should focus on promoting the purchase of agricultural products and ensure effective distribution. Except for appropriate restrictions on the rationing of general consumer goods, appropriate reserve quantities should be retained for use to promote the purchase of materials and implement price controls. The rationing of materials for exchange should focus on absorbing major agricultural products such as rice and cotton, as well as pastoral materials from non-peaceful areas. It should be distributed appropriately according to the type of materials to be purchased. The shipment of allocated materials from Shanghai and the overall wholesale in various regions should be handled by the Commerce Control Council's subordinate agencies. The shipment of materials allocated previously from Shanghai should adopt a mandatory system. Regarding the rationing of general consumer goods or exchange materials by local rationing agencies, the local agencies of the Commerce Control Council should operate cooperatives as a principle for rationing exchange materials. The rationing agencies for exchange materials should, in areas where lower-level agencies of the Commerce Control Council have been established, operate the various local lower-level agencies of the council as a principle. In areas where the Commerce Control Council has not established lower-level agencies, especially in areas close to non-peaceful areas, the various local purchasing agencies should be used as a principle. As for cooperatives, they should be appropriately used in any of the above areas. The Commerce Control Council should establish offices in eighteen major regions to manage exchange agencies and be responsible for handling the exchange of materials in various regions. The agencies affiliated with the Commerce Control Council, when handling the rationing of exchange materials, should follow the methods listed on the left. The specific implementation guidelines for purchasing various materials will be established separately. The agencies affiliated with the Commerce Control Council and the material purchasing agencies should negotiate to designate locations in various regions to handle the distribution of exchange materials and should, before the stipulated deadline, accurately distribute the types and quantities of each material to each distribution point. When agricultural product purchasers deliver the purchased materials to the warehouse designated by the material purchasing agency, they should issue a material exchange voucher with the name, quantity, deadline, and distribution point of the exchange items. The purchaser can exchange the voucher for exchange materials at the designated distribution point. (1) When cooperatives handle the rationing of exchange materials, if cooperative members can jointly collect and supply locally produced materials, the township or county/city cooperative can centrally collect materials from the agencies affiliated with the local Commerce Control Council. The implementation methods will be negotiated by the agencies affiliated with the local Commerce Control Council, the cooperative, and the purchasing agency. (2) When material purchasing agencies handle the rationing of exchange materials, the principle is that the purchasing agency directly receives the distributed materials from the receiving agency of the Commerce Control Council. The handling of rationing matters should still make great efforts to use the existing lower-level distribution agencies. The previous rationing method does not adopt a voucher system but instead allows the purchasing agency to directly deliver the materials it has purchased to the agricultural product purchasers. The prices of materials rationed under these guidelines are determined according to the following standards: (1) The prices of urban general rationing and exchange materials should refer to the general price levels in each region to determine fair prices and should gradually adapt to low-price policies. The prices of exchange materials in areas adjacent to non-peaceful areas should be determined with reference to local market prices. (2) The general rationing prices of cooperatives should not include adjustment fees in principle. Adjustment fees should be handled centrally by the Commerce Control Council in principle, but depending on the local situation, the Commerce Control Council may allocate a portion to local handling. The financial measures required to implement these guidelines should be planned by the local authorities themselves, but the Commerce Control Council should provide as much assistance as possible. The implementation of these guidelines should involve close liaison between the relevant agencies in each region, and widespread assistance from local agencies such as county/city/district/town. The implementation of these guidelines should be actively sought by local agencies, and the "Outline of Rewards for Material Purchases" should be given to farmers for publicity and to purchasing agencies or cooperatives, which should be submitted by the Material Control Review Committee to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Efforts Underway to Increase Coal Briquette Rationing; Daily Increase in Coal Shipments from North China to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Due to the scarcity of coal in the city recently, speculators have manipulated and hoarded it, causing prices to skyrocket and creating a fuel panic. Now, with the strict crackdown and control by relevant bureaus, as well as the smoothing of supply sources and the implementation of rationing, the market price has stopped rising, and public sentiment has stabilized somewhat. It is learned that the Coal United Association, in an effort to suppress the fuel panic and restore the coal supply to its previous state, has dispatched Bureau Chief Da Qiao to the coal-producing areas of North China to contact the Chang Bureau, smooth out supply routes, and purchase a large amount of coal to Shanghai. According to a Central News Agency reporter, it was recently learned from Da Zhong Lian Coal Company that the amount of coal shipped from North China to Shanghai has been increasing daily, with extremely rich reserves. There is a sufficient supply of raw materials for rationing to various briquette factories, and the production of coal briquettes has increased. The Economic Section of the First District Office is seeking ways to increase the rationing of coal briquettes.</p>
<p>Factory Coal Rationing Being Prepared</p>
<p>The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company is preparing the rationing procedures for 7,000 tons of coal for factories in January. In addition, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company and the Coal United Association have obtained a significant amount of coal for water kiosks and are currently awaiting the issuance of permits from the First District Office before issuing it. As for coal for bathhouses, the authorities have allowed rationing, but because the Bathhouse Association is preparing a roster of members and the procedures are slow, there is no basis for immediate rationing. Once the association's roster of members is submitted, the required amount will be rationed. Therefore, the supply of coal in the city should be sufficient in the future.</p>
<p>Affordable Coal for Hot Water Shops</p>
<p>The First District Office decided yesterday that starting today, it will begin rationing affordable coal to 619 hot water shops in the First and Eighth Districts, as well as the Nanshi and Huxi areas. Each hot water shop owner can bring their original seal and association notice from 1:00 PM today to 23:00 PM on the 23rd to the association to obtain a registration certificate. Then, they can obtain a "Coal Purchase Certificate" from the Material Rationing Section of the Economic Section of the First District Office in Room 701, 3rd Floor, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, before paying for the goods at the designated coal company. The industry previously increased the selling price to one yuan per ladle of Central Reserve Certificates due to the soaring price of coal. Now that affordable fuel can be obtained, the cost has been slightly reduced, so it has been decided to reduce the price to five cents from February 1 of this year.</p>
<h3>Cracks Have Emerged Among the Anti-Axis Powers; Talk by Information Minister Hirota</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy met with reporters in the city at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor at 3:00 PM yesterday (20th) as usual. During the meeting, he delivered a speech on the current world situation, explaining in great detail the mutual contradictions in the political, military, and other policies of the anti-Axis powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The content of his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Are Passive on the Second Front</p>
<p>Since the Tehran Conference last fall, it has been rumored that "the anti-Axis side, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, have reached a complete understanding," and "the anti-Axis Britain and the United States will form a second front on the European continent and launch an attack on Germany. In the Pacific, they will strengthen their attack on Japan." However, judging from the actual situation, the anti-Axis powers have not been able to reach consensus in political, military, or economic aspects. In reality, there is a fierce opposition movement in Britain and the United States regarding the second front issue. Therefore, Britain and the United States are extremely passive about forming a second front. As a result, the Soviet Union is now extremely worried about the passive attitude of Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States landed in North Africa, Sicily, and southern Italy, where there are no defensive facilities, and suffered significant losses. Moreover, if Britain and the United States attempt to land in France and the Balkans this time, the German side has long been prepared and has strong defenses, so it can be predicted that they will suffer great losses. It is estimated that the loss of soldiers in Britain and the United States will be more than three million in 1944-1945, which is meaningless. The domestic public is also gradually understanding this, and opposition is gradually becoming fierce, causing great difficulties for the governments of both countries.</p>
<p>Political Opinions Are Difficult to Unify</p>
<p>Britain and the United States cannot agree on the issue of the gradual expansion of communist forces in Europe. Britain especially opposes the southward expansion of Soviet communism. Although the United States has stated that communism is not a threat to the world, its citizens cannot accept this. Therefore, the inability of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to unify their political opinions has been fully exposed. At the same time, the gradual expansion of communist forces into the European continent has made Britain and the United States feel the danger of its threat, prompting Britain and the United States to restore their relations with the Soviet Union to the era when they were enemies in the past. In response to this situation, the Axis powers have established perfect preparations to reduce the enemy's attack power and are confident of ultimate victory regardless of when the war ends.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Registration for Scholarships; Deadline on the 22nd; Junior 3 and Senior 1 Students Submit Application Forms Today</h3>
<p>Due to the approaching school term and the excessive number of applications, the scholarship affairs for this session must be expedited. Students who need assistance must submit their application forms and receive their registration certificates according to the stipulated dates. Yesterday, it was announced that if there are indeed reasons why application forms could not be submitted in time, the school would compile and submit them. After much consideration, it was deemed inconvenient in terms of time. Now it has been decided that all application forms for Junior High School 3, Senior High School 1, Senior High School 2, Senior High School 3, and University/Business groups must be registered within the previously announced dates. Late submissions will not be accepted. As for Senior Elementary School 1st and 2nd graders and Junior High School 1st and 2nd graders' application forms, if they were not submitted last time, they must be registered by the 22nd of this month. Late registrations will not be accommodated. Today, application forms for Junior High School 3 and Senior High School 1 will be received. Students who need assistance are asked to personally bring their application forms, along with a "personal statement," to register.</p>
<p>All Sectors Enthusiastically Support Scholarships</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wu Shaowu sent 20,000 national currency to donate to the poor, which is commendable for his public spirit and righteousness. On Mr. Rong Zhenwang's thirtieth birthday, his relatives and friends gave him gifts. He allocated all the gift money, totaling 12,000 yuan, to scholarships. Cun Yang Tang Yao sent 9,600 yuan in cash to be used as the newspaper's scholarship fund.

<h3>60th Round of Rice Flour on Sale Today</h3>
<p>The 60th round of rice flour for household ration is on sale starting today. Residents can take their rice flour purchase tickets to the designated rice shops to purchase two and a half sheng of white rice and one catty of first-class flour, for a total price of 28 Central Reserve Certificates. If citizens discover that rice shops have mixed or other irregularities, they should immediately report them to the nearest police authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>32nd Round of Rice in the City District Advanced for Public Sale</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Food Bureau issued a notice yesterday (20th), stating that the 31st round of publicly sold brown rice, which is about to be sold, has been increased to two sheng, and the 32nd round will be further increased to two and a half sheng and will be changed to white rice. However, the bureau's public sales have been overdue for several months. Although efforts have been made to expedite the process, and the two rounds have been combined, there is still a delay of more than ten days. Therefore, the date of the 32nd round of public sales should be delayed until early February. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, citizens are in urgent need of rice. In order to suppress grain prices, the bureau has specially exchanged the 32nd and 31st rounds for sale, so that citizens can obtain more and better rice during the Spring Festival. It is now scheduled to sell the 32nd round of public sales from the 21st to the 30th of this month. Citizens in each district should purchase the allocated white rice of two and a half sheng with their certificates at the designated public sales locations within the period. Each sheng is 8 national currency, totaling 20 yuan. It will be invalidated after the deadline. The date for supplementary issuance of the 31st round will be announced separately.</p>
<h3>Medical Association and Two Other Groups Form Dispute Research Association to Handle Disputes Between Patients and Doctors</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the Shanghai Special City Medical Association, and the Shanghai Public and Private Hospital Federation held a banquet at the Conference Hall of the Industrial and Commercial Federation in the Xingya Building on the Bund yesterday (20th) at 12:00 PM to entertain members of the city's press. Presidents of the city's hospitals and famous doctors Gu Nanqun, Yan Fuqing, Yu Yunxiu, Zhu Qizhang, Tang Yuhan, Zhu Yanggao, etc., attended, as well as more than 30 journalists including Chen Binhe, Yang Jionglang, Chen Ying, Qiu Shimu, and Ren Yunpeng.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Gu Nanqun first rose to speak on behalf of the group: "I am deeply grateful to all of you for attending today. You are authorities in public opinion and lead the masses in society. I and my colleagues in the medical community deeply respect you. Recently, there have been constant disputes between the medical community and patients in society. Although the medical community cannot be said to be without fault in this situation, there are also many patients who do not understand the situation, so misunderstandings occur. As medical professionals, we should do our best to serve the public and never refuse to save a patient who is in imminent danger. Now, due to the large number of disputes, the medical community has suffered, and the impact is not small. In order to correct this situation and prevent this trend from growing, the three associations have jointly organized the 'Medical Dispute Research Association' to study the causes and reasons for the disputes. Prominent doctors and experts in various fields in the city will be responsible for handling the organization of the association."</p>
<p>Impact of Disputes</p>
<p>Yu Yunxiu then gave a detailed explanation from the medical perspective. Later, Tian Yan Fuqing gave a speech: "The current situation of disputes not only affects my colleagues in the medical community but also affects society to a great extent. However, although it is the duty of the medical community to serve the public, there are inevitably speculative and false doctors mixed in. Therefore, it is necessary for the medical community to reorganize. In addition, experimental areas have been designated in the 182 Districts and Huxi and other civilian areas. Now, Daxilu and other places in Xujiahui Town have been selected to start civilian health work, with the aim of serving the public with doctors and instilling correct concepts of popularizing medical knowledge. Finally, he also explained many pathological conditions.</p>
<p>Representative's Thank You</p>
<p>Finally, Chen Binhe, a representative of the press, thanked them, saying, "I have just learned a lot about medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, which is not insignificant. The members of the press and the medical community have the same goal of serving society. Therefore, now that the medical community is experiencing difficulties, this unfortunate dispute not only affects society but also affects the welfare of the citizens. Although today's gathering is ordinary, its significance is not insignificant."</p>

<p>Yesterday's news dispatch at 7:20 PM</p>
<h3>Economic Commentary on the National Savings Movement</h3>
<p>Wartime savings have at least two crucial significances: first, to expand production funds, and second, to promote frugality among the people. From the former perspective, savings can assist the country in digesting public bonds, thereby providing funds for production expansion. From the latter perspective, savings can put the people's floating purchasing power into a dormant state, thereby reducing unnecessary daily consumption. This is the task wartime savings undertake, and participating in the savings movement is the duty the people should bear.</p>
<p>The recent launch of the national savings movement in the capital, with various agencies, organizations, youth groups, and shops depositing funds in the Central Reserve Bank and encouraging the public to participate in frugality and savings in order to achieve the goal of saving to serve the country, is truly exciting. However, what we expect is the long-term and widespread implementation of wartime savings.</p>
<p>The basic policy for promoting savings should strive to avoid legal enforcement and instead allow the people to practice voluntary savings out of patriotism. However, whether the promotion of savings proceeds smoothly undoubtedly depends on whether those leading the wartime national savings movement can painstakingly and diligently research various countermeasures. These countermeasures must not only be novel and organized but also focus on absorbing the sources of national economic resources. Only then can satisfactory results be achieved, contributing to the country's economy and the people's livelihood during wartime. Further commentary will be provided to fully explain this.</p>
<h3>The Economic Sector is Organizing a Huaihai Survey Group to Investigate the Economic Situation in the Province</h3>
<p>The Su-Huai region has a close relationship with the exchange of materials between Central and North China. Since the National Government decided to re-establish the area as Huaihai Province, its importance has increased even further. In order to accurately understand the actual situation of the province, economic figures in this city will organize an economic survey group to conduct an on-site investigation of all economic conditions in the area. Currently, relevant parties in this city are actively carrying out organizational matters for the survey group. In addition to authoritative figures from the economic sector serving as members, selections will also be made from various public organizations. It is expected that after the establishment of the province, it will contribute to the exchange of materials between the North and South.</p>

<h3>Situation on Various Fronts in Greater East Asia: Japanese Army's Efforts in Battle: Answers by Spokesperson of Japanese Army to Questions by Reporters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The spokesperson of the Shanghai Army Press Department of the Japanese Army met with Chinese journalists at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 20th, answering questions from reporters of various newspapers. He gave a detailed account of the defense and combat efforts of the Japanese army on various battlefields and clarified the determination to win. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chinese Daily News Question) What is the progress of the situation in the Burma battlefield?</p>
<p>(Answer) The anti-Axis forces have high expectations for overcoming Burma. Our army has long anticipated the enemy's intentions, first with the operations north of Beixi, where the enemy was defeated last year. Recently, the expeditionary force of the Chongqing side in the area of A-mu has completed American-style training. The enemy side has also transferred the Gurkha forces, which have relatively strong anti-British sentiments, to the area of Ceylon Island, while mobilizing newly arrived African indigenous troops to the Zhuyi line, consistently making it their mission to sacrifice other ethnic groups. In December of last year, the Japanese army reduced the enemy forces by about one thousand north of Pukidon. On the night of the 8th of this year, they once again defeated the enemy forces that attacked the Chongte area. Recently, the enemy has shown some signs of activity on the Beixi front, but without any proactive actions. Also, recently, the Ling side has been frequently conducting reconnaissance on the area of Jitebo Island. Since the enemy has no land-based strategies to implement, they are repeatedly carrying out bombing raids on Burma and Vietnam, using the Tenth Air Force stationed in India, which has been incorporated into the Eastern Air Force. This is simply sacrificing innocent civilians. The Japanese army's air force has also launched attacks on various bases, including Tonsa, A-mu, the Arakan region, and Calcutta, suppressing the enemy's air force and making the enemy confirm that control of the airspace over the mainland is still in the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>(Shen Bao Question) What is the recent battle situation on the Yunnan-Burma front?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is reported that Chen Cheng, the commander of the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma, expressed extreme indignation at the non-rescue attitude of the British and Indian armies and resigned in mid-November, while simultaneously suggesting to Chiang Kai-shek that the Chongqing army should take independent military action. In short, the Chongqing army's dissatisfaction with the British and American military officers has been fully exposed. The Chongqing army, which was deceived and driven away west of the Nu River, is panicked about the Japanese army's attacks. How Wei Lihuang, Chen Cheng's successor, will clean up this expeditionary force is a real problem.</p>
<h3>Current Situation on the China Front</h3>
<p>(New China News Question) What is the situation on the Central China front?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Changde operation has concluded with a major victory. The Japanese army in Central China completely annihilated the Chongqing army that was stirring up trouble in the Sixth and Fifty-second War Zones during the mopping-up operations, and on December 25th of last year, it restored the original state. Conflicts often arise between the Chongqing and Communist armies, especially in the Third War Zone.</p>
<p>(New China News Question) What is the current situation on the South China front?</p>
<p>(Answer) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the railway that was damaged by the British army was repeatedly cleared by the Japanese army and, with the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, has now resumed traffic.</p>
<p>(New China News Question) What is the current situation on the North China Front?</p>
<p>(Answer) Mopping-up operations are continuously being carried out in the North China area. Last year, the number of abandoned corpses of bandits and those captured and surrendered reached as many as 300,000. Currently, the clearing operations are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Chongqing Air Force</h3>
<p>(New Daily News Question) The British and American armies recently attempted to disrupt peaceful areas using their remaining air force in Chongqing, implementing blind harassment tactics. What is the reality of the air force in Chongqing, the movement of the harassment tactics, and the preparations of the Japanese Air Force?</p>
<p>(Answer) The army air force in China shot down and destroyed 153 American air force planes in Chongqing in mid-December last winter, eliminating the enemy's ambition to disrupt the mainland. Enemy aircraft appeared over Taiwan twice, on November 25th of last year and January 11th of this year. Their intention is not difficult to discern. Although the enemy suffered a major blow, they still attempt to take advantage of our unpreparedness to attack Wuhan, Guangzhou, and the Yangtze River basin. Recently, the enemy has deployed a large number of aircraft to the southeast of China, attempting to threaten our southern supply lines. However, their repeated sorties, preempted by the Japanese army, fully expose their weakness and incompetence. The Chongqing air force is confined to the interior. In short, the Japanese army's control of the airspace over the mainland remains unshaken.</p>
<h3>Western District Youth Basketball Showdown: Hualian vs. Dongfang in Championship Final</h3>
<p>The Western District Youth Basketball Tournament features four games tonight, starting at 6:15 PM. Among them, the Group A match between Hualian Pharmacy and Dongfang is essentially the championship final. Hualian has repeatedly defeated the local Western District powerhouses, including the giants, Mononok, and the strong Chinese teams, including Hua Nan and Tongren, with six consecutive wins. Their only major concern is Dongfang. Dongfang has emerged as a force in Shanghai this year, harboring championship ambitions. Unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat in their match against Tongren. If Dongfang can win tonight, it will create a three-way tie with Hualian, the giants, and Dongfang each losing once. Therefore, a fierce and exciting battle is expected. However, according to Dongfang's official announcement: Zhang Jiakui, Gao Baozheng, and Li Zude, who are staying in Xiqing, and Wang Jinghu, who is staying in the Soviet Union, were unable to arrive in time. Bao Songyuan is unlikely to play. Zhang Shaoqing and Xu Wenkui are both suffering from bronchitis and are unable to serve. The internal decision is to field Fan Qingxian, Wu Huanian, Qian Jingyong, Gu Senkang, Gu Likang, Wu Guolin, Zhong En, etc. With such a lineup, Hualian is likely to win. The schedule for tonight is as follows: (Also, tickets for the Western District, starting today, will be sold for 13 yuan upstairs and 26 yuan downstairs.)</p>
<p>Opponent / Team (Group) / Time</p>
<p>E Team vs. Soviet (B3) 6:15 PM</p>
<p>Dongfang vs. Hualian (Group A) 7:10 PM</p>
<p>Hua Ying vs. Mononok (Group A) 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Charity Football Match - Western Union Lineup</p>
<p>The Shanghai Football Association's Spring Festival Charity Football Tournament will feature the first match between China and Portugal on the 27th. The second match, China vs. Western Union, will take place at 10:30 AM on the 30th at Yiguo Stadium. The Western Union lineup has been finalized by the selection committee members Ma Shan'er, Monuo, and Bo Tuola, including five players from the Overseas Chinese United, two from Portuguese business, one from the police, and two from the strong Group C team, Shigewen. Ma Shan'er will serve as the manager. Ticket pre-sales will begin on the 24th. The Western Union lineup is listed below: Mai Nidi (Overseas Chinese United), Luo Xulai (Overseas Chinese United), Ke Laituo (Police), W. Pantuo Xun (Shigewen), Xi Ladi (Overseas Chinese United), H. Kelasha (Portuguese Business), Di Panna (Overseas Chinese United), Bao Xiutuo (Portuguese Business), Lao Botuo Fu (Police), Bao Jie (Overseas Chinese United), Fu En (Shigewen).</p>

<h3>National Forum: The Improvements That Western Pharmaceutical Factories Should Make by Hu Min</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of Western medicines has been cut off, and the domestic Western medicine industry has seen a temporary surge.</p>
<p>However, if a factory is opened and the products are poor or reduced because of improper use of personnel, or "personnel cannot give full play to their talents and equipment cannot be fully utilized," then isn't the life of the factory very worrying? The author would like to offer a word to the heads of pharmaceutical factories based on what I have seen and heard:</p>
<p>Ordinary factories recruit personnel with experience as a prerequisite, but the author believes that experienced people, if they do not have the enterprising determination to strive for excellence, then their work value is lower than those who have the determination to strive for excellence but have no experience. Because although the latter have no experience, they will definitely have more skills and experience than the former in the future, relying only on their enterprising determination.</p>
<p>Some factories think that the newly recruited personnel are all uneducated, so the work they are given is trivial and meaningless. Moreover, because they are new, they are not given any right to speak. The author has a cousin who used to be a trainee in a small pharmaceutical factory. According to him, every morning he would help the chemist wash bottles, fetch things, install instruments, disassemble instruments, etc. He would do this all day long without rest or change. Sometimes he felt that what the chemist was doing was unreasonable. However, he was a new trainee, and the chemist thought of him as "just a high school graduate, how much knowledge could he have?" Of course, he dared not speak up, and could not speak up. When the factory director thought that the products were too slow or poor and extended the working hours, wouldn't it be the trainees who suffered?</p>
<p>Some pharmaceutical factories often misuse instruments. For example, a tube that has just passed chlorine gas is placed on the shelf, and the person does not wipe or inspect it before taking it to use for filtration. How can the things filtered out in this way be good? Some people use huge air pumps to supply porcelain cups with a diameter of less than four centimeters for filtration. In fact, the pumping force required for such a porcelain cup is the same as the suction generated when a long rubber tube is used as a siphon. Why use a huge air pump to "waste talent on a small task"?</p>
<p>The author has also visited a pharmaceutical factory. The factory was equipped with a sophisticated air pump, the scale of which can be said to exert the utmost force on the mercury column of 0.25 inches. However, this sophisticated machine is not used for sophisticated work, but for filtration that does not require precise air extraction. The author believes that in today's world where motive power is expensive, it may be possible to replace this electric-powered machine with a hand-cranked machine. Its structure can be roughly modified by imitating a steam engine. As for the parts that are prone to air leakage, cheap soft padding can be used to prevent them. In this way, assuming that the effective volume of the cylinder is 5,000 CC and the efficiency is 60%, then one round trip of the piston would have a pressure of 45.6 millimeters of mercury column height, and a vacuum with a volume of 10,000 CC would be provided for application. If 100 CC is required per second, then it can also be used for one and two-thirds minutes. These pressures and these times are enough for the filtration required.</p>
<p>Some factories, when distilling liquids with lower boiling points - such as alcohol, ether, or acetone - are afraid of explosions, so they specifically prepare a water bath and have one person manage the temperature and another person change the hot water. Such distillation not only consumes manpower, but also the temperature is not necessarily stable, because the temperature difference during the exchange of hot water is often between six and seven degrees - Celsius - and can be as high as a dozen degrees. In the author's opinion, it may be possible to steam it over a fire with a water bath. If you are afraid of fire, you can use a safety net with good heat transfer to cover the fire, just like the safety lamps used by coal miners. If the entire condenser is insulated, then the medicines in the receiver, which is a long distance away, can be safely stored without worrying about how easily they explode. In this way, not only can manpower be saved, but also the temperature can be kept stable - because the temperature of the gas lamp can be adjusted.</p>
<p>All of these things, I hope the pharmaceutical factory authorities will improve.</p>
<h3>Navy: Ambition by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang (10)</h3>
<p>(Decision is the most important thing...)</p>
<p>Yinmo and the naval seniors in Edo resolutely adopted the British style. Such a decision, after hundreds of years, has had such brilliant achievements, and I am truly grateful, but when I think back to my own current situation, I am really ashamed.</p>
<p>(I have not yet decided to enter the Army Officer School or the Naval Academy.)</p>
<p>Although I have already decided to become a soldier in the future, I have not yet made a concrete decision. In Japan, there is no such thing as just a soldier. It is either a soldier of the anchor or a soldier of the star.</p>
<p>(Okay, I will make a decision today.)</p>
<p>It is no longer an age to waste time. Isn't it written in that book that Saigo also went on an expedition at the age of seventeen?</p>
<p>He returned the book to the librarian, shrugged his shoulders, and left the reading room. He came wearing a uniform and wooden clogs, so he had to change into straw sandals in the shoe cabinet.</p>
<p>"Tani, did you come to the library too?" A friend of the same grade, Ozaki, who was not very close, shouted at the exit.</p>
<p>"Huh! What are you doing there?"</p>
<p>"It's raining, and I didn't bring an umbrella."</p>
<p>Indeed, it was raining heavily outside.</p>
<p>"Then, come under my umbrella!"</p>
<p>Zhenren, who had always been prepared for a rainy day, happened to have brought an umbrella.</p>
<p>The two of them held up the umbrella together, walking through the heavy wind and rain from the front of Terukuni Shrine to the Tenmonkan Road.</p>
<p>"The rain is heavy!" Ozaki was soaked all over, rolling his trousers up to his knees. The water was flowing down his ankles like a squeezed towel.</p>
<p>Zhenren didn't even look at him, walking proudly. In fact, he had forgotten all about the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Nakahara Yusuke was born in Satsuma... Akatsuka, Ito, Nirei, Kawamura, Tsunoyama, Yamamoto, and Togo were all born in Satsuma. He was only thinking about those things.</p>
<p>"Tani...where are you going?" Ozaki walked to the streetcar road on Tenmonkan Road and spoke to Zhenren, who was still walking forward. There was a streetcar there that went directly to where they lived, without having to change streetcars halfway.</p>
<p>Zhenren was unexpectedly reminded, looking around, he saw a sky full of wind and rain. The unique heavy rain of the Satsuma region was sprinkling on the road from the gray-black sky like blooming flowers. The electric wires were being blown by the strong wind, whistling. Everything seemed like the first day of the Satsuma-English War.</p>
<p>"Ozaki, let's go...don't take the streetcar!" Zhenren walked straight across the streetcar road. At that time, it was as if something was starting to ignite in his heart. Ozaki was confused and a little unhappy, following under Zhenren's umbrella.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Establishing Others by Establishing Oneself: Poor Student Donates Money to Help Students</h3>
<p>Lianshui Pan, from a poor family, graduated from junior high school and came to Shanghai as an apprentice in a store. He served diligently, and read books in his spare time, without failing for several years. He was greatly valued by the store owner. Pan felt that his knowledge was insufficient, and determined to enroll in night school to study Chinese and bookkeeping in order to further his studies. He listened attentively, and asked questions whenever he had doubts. He was punctual for class, rain or shine. His homework was neatly written, without any errors. His sincerity in studying was very different from his peers. Recently, Pan was worried that the schools would greatly increase tuition fees in the next semester, and he would not be able to afford it. Therefore, he took out 300 yuan of his savings and presented it to the head of the school, requesting that two more free places be added. The head of the school praised his ambition and immediately announced it to wait for applications from poor students. Confucius said: "Wishing to establish oneself, one should also establish others." Pan is indeed a role model. (From Shu)</p>
<h3>Noodle Industry Distributes Food</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Noodle Food Industry Association, in view of the difficult lives of refugees, orphans, the disabled, and the hidden poor, especially in the cold winter, and their inability to seek help, specially consulted with members of the industry and agreed to voluntarily donate a large number of noodle cakes, steamed buns, and other foods. Yesterday morning, Chairman Wang Bing of the association specially sent two representatives, Yao Jinbiao and Dai Ziquan, to the Xin Puyu Hall on Guohuo Road in Nanshi, and immediately donated 500 catties of noodle products. Then, they went to the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home and donated 100 catties of noodle products. Today, they will continue to go to other relief organizations to donate to benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Good Opportunity for Studying</h3>
<p>The Social Welfare Office of the First District Public Office has established workers' technical specialty night schools in two locations: the East School is located at No. 100 Jingzhou Road in the Municipal Jingzhou Road Primary School, and the West School is located at No. 25 Mabai Road in the Municipal Model Middle School. The school has classes three times a week. Enrollment for the mechanical and electrical engineering departments, grades one and two, and the preparatory class for the next semester will begin immediately.
