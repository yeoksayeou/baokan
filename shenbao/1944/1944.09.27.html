<h3 id="c1">現代人的責任 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>現代人的責任有三：　　第一，對於過去民族，負有發揚光大的責任。一個民族的文化學術思想等等一切，都是繩繩相續，綿延不斷的。前人所奮鬥而開闢遺留的都有獨立的，永久的精神，這個精神就是每個民族建立的基本，每個民族都有他的建立精神，一代一代的繼續擴充。現代的人已經有了過去民族的一份遺產，就當利用這一份遺產，進一步的擴充。這份遺產是先代辛勤努力的結晶，是先代的汗血，我們不但應當謹愼小心地保持，並且還要竭力去發揚光大。先民精神是國寶，國寶的永生表示國家民族的永生，國寶的光大更表示國家民族的光大，這個，對於現代的人是責無旁貸的。　　第二，對於現代同時期的民族，負有革新和創造的責任。任何事業都免不了受環境的影響，任何事業都可以創造出新環境。當舊的不能應付時，人們就不得不想法子改變，去適合新的環境，改變的結果就是革新，革新的結果就是永久的存在。所謂窮則變，變則通，通則久，是世界上一切進代的原則。革新的責任是現代人所應負的，革新的意義就在增加民族的新生命，輸送給民族一些新血液，好比花樹菓樹的接枝，使花更艷麗，葉更繁茂。所以在應當革新的時候，現代人就應當負起責任來實行，否則民族衰老，必至無法生存。其次，前人種樹，後人乘涼，我們接受了先民的遺產，我們也得創造新的資產，這樣，方才對得住民族和國家。想想在洪荒草昧的先代，處處都是天然的困難和障碍，先民不畏艱難，不避險阻，不辭勞苦，赤手空拳，開天闢地，竟造成了現代這樣的世界，他們的勇氣，他們的魄力，他們的志向　眞是山高水長，使後人欽佩得五體投地。現在我們已經進代到一個新世界，天然的險阻都消滅殆盡了，人造的工具也差不多完備了，我們還不努力去創造出一點新事業來，眞是沒有志氣。就把中國來說，數千年以前，我們的先祖用最苦幹的方法造成了萬里長城和運河，我們現在有新的人力，新的方法，我們難道不能用機械的力量造出一二件比萬里長城和運河更偉大的工程嗎？假如有能力而不做，或是沒有能力去做，那末，現在的我們是不掙氣，我們願意做不掙氣的民族嗎？　　第三，對於未來的民族，負有培養扶育的責任。國家民族的前途應該由下一代人去負責，可是使下一代人個個都成爲國家的精銳強壯份子，卻是現代人的責任。示來民族是前進的，或是落伍的，是強健的，或是衰弱的，是勇敢的，或是懦怯的，都要靠我們的培育，好比種花，我們的責任在灌溉，要開好花，我們就得用力去灌溉。所以怎樣教育小國民，怎樣充實他的身心，而最重要的，怎樣使每個小國民都有受教育的機會，這些問題，都是現代人應當負責去解決的。</p>

<h3 id="c15">文化人的任務—答重慶文化人的批判 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>現在日本和中國有共同的文化現象。那就是報章上每日滿篇累幅地刋登着千篇一律，乾燥無味的文章。無論那一家報紙，都發表着令人頭痛的宣傳文字，和平區則充斥着[大東亞八股文]和[和平八股文]，而抗戰區則平行着[抗戰八股文]和[共產主義八股文]，在形式上儘管，如不打動別人的心弦，豈不就失掉宣傳的意義麼？缺乏誠實性的宣傳，和無文化天良的宣傳，則除用作批屁股紙外，別無用途。然而現在的和這類揩屁股紙。林語堂會說過：[認爲文學是政治的奴僕，這就是把文學中的心靈的自由活動削除，而毀滅文學的意思。例如政治宣傳，每天假定總是對出錢給報紙的政治家，作肉麻的歌功頌德宣傳，則決不會達到宣傳目的的。文學主要必須打動人的心弦。人生描寫只有眞實，該文學方不至於有毒素]（Confucius　Saw　Nan　cy　ByLin　Yutang　82-83）。此處所說的打動人的心弦，就是作家對於一般人所同樣感覺而不能發表出來的現實，而與以生動表現出來的意思。文化不管在戰時或平時，主要都必須向這一方向努力·這就是文化人的任務。不久前會和和平區的著名文化人談到過這一問題，他說戰時檢查制度太嚴，而不能寫打動人民心弦的眞正文章。然而我認爲，文化人爲打動人民心弦，也總比寫一般人不要讀而隨即充作揩鼻紙的那種宣傳文字強勝多多。按一般情形來說，檢查機構是根據固定的法律行使職權，所以對於社會的進步，尤其對於目前這種驚人飛躍的政治進步，是決難追隨的。進步中的現實，往往超過了驨念形態，恰如發育強盛的兒童所穿的衣服，很快就對身體不適合了一樣，而舊的觀念形態業已與現實脫節了。民衆由於實際生活，而感覺到這樣現實的進步，所以他們迫切要求對於進步的現實，有一明確的說明。假如文化人把握住這一民衆的要求，而言其欲言而不能言者，告其欲知而不能知的理由，有時候就需要打破按未進步前的狀態所規定的檢查制度。爲打開文化要求與檢查制度間所存在的這種矛盾，則不外檢查官對時局進步把握要不斷努力，與文化人對能表現的現實要正視，要接近，檢查官如不努力認識時局的演進，而只一味認爲檢查這樣重大政治任務，如按法律解釋執行就天下大吉，則與其說他把文化看作政治的奴僕，倒勿寗說，把政治作成乞丐了。（鳴呼！此之謂政治之貧困乎！）　　假如文化人都怕檢查官，而不管目前的客觀情形如何，只小心翼翼，如履薄冰般地唯恐有違於當局所宣示的宣傳細則，完全形成這類脫離現實的宣傳文字，則人民不久即會對當局的方針發生離心力。最近的政治宣傳文字，並不感覺到有五花八門的精彩表現形式，也看不到寫這類文章的人們有文化天良上的煩悶，所以就沒有令人加以思索的事。於是文化人的海闊天空的本能，正像政治柵欄內動物園的獅子一樣，非常安心地在睡眠中。好像大人對於參觀動物園的獅子，業已不感覺興味，即稍有思想的人們，對於這種八股文業已感覺壓倦。如果文化人明知這一點而不敢越出旣定文化方針一步，這就是十足的文化怠工。假定文化人感覺到非發表當前現實不可的衝動時，因懼怕檢查制度的嚴酷，而不敢發表，那末一國的文化，還會有任何進步麼？從而檢查制度本身也還能有改善希望麼？　　文化人研究現實的魄力與認眞的態度，就是一個挽救檢查方針的固定性與停滯性之重要困素。孝經上說：[父有爭子，則身不陷於不義]，所以文化界內如有[爭子]，而國家的文化方針方能沿康莊大道前進。話雖如此說，但我也知道在這個時代發表現實，是非常困難的。這的確需要充分的勇氣，軍人在必要時，隨時都準備用刀破腹，而文化人也應當在必要時，隨時都準備用筆破腹。假如都有這種決心，縱有天大障碍，也決不會完全不能發表現實的。自從有史以來，任何時代都從未有過完全言論自由的情形。文化人每當如實表現眞理時，總是碰到某種限制的。在這樣的限制下想表現眞理，於是在輾轉反側的痛苦煩悶中，磨練出文化天良與發表技術來。當洶湧澎湃的情緒衝向表現的限制，以及在情緒中去蕪存菁時，則作品方能蘊藏着鋼鐵般的潛在力與持久不滅的光輝。　　綜觀上述，阿匹君也總該瞭解政治與文化間的一般關係了。同時我希望阿匹君，根據我上面所述，再對我的文章重新估價一下。古語說：[衆惡之必罕焉，衆好之必察焉]，那末假如我的文章爲中國人的[衆]所[好]，當然一定有其理由在的。我的文章，詞句並不美麗，理論也更不高深，這是我很知道的。旣然我的文章內有被[衆]所[好]之處，或許那就是我的文化天良，也就是在目前的限制中，總想說明中國現實的一棵赤裸裸的誠心。如把我的文章內削除這一[誠實性]，則等於從西門慶身上割去[那話]一樣。阿匹君是不瞭解我文章中的這一文化天良和這一誠實性的？不，他很懂得，他會明明白白地說：[但我對於吉田東祐也還有一點佩服的，因爲他無意之間常常會說出一些老實話]。他不明白我是絞腦榨汗，特意想說老實話的，而他只知道我是[無意之間]會說出一些眞理的。我想，讀我文章的許多讀者，一定不會提出阿匹君這樣批判是否正確的問題，正如誰都不會提到象是否有鼻子的問題一樣。這一點，我認爲還是讓[衆]來加以批評的好。　　子貢問曰：[鄉人皆好之，何如？]子曰：[未可也。][鄉人皆惡之，何如？]子曰：[未可也。不如鄉人之善者好之，其不善者惡之。]（魯譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Responsibility of Modern People <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The responsibility of modern people is threefold: First, to carry forward and enhance the glory of past generations. A nation's culture, academic thought, and everything else are continuous and unbroken strands. The struggles and legacies of our predecessors possess independent, enduring spirits. These spirits form the foundation of each nation, and each nation possesses its foundational spirit, which is expanded generation after generation. Modern people have already inherited a portion of the legacy of past generations, and should utilize this legacy to expand further. This legacy is the crystallization of the hard work of our ancestors, their sweat and blood. We should not only carefully preserve it, but also strive to carry it forward and enhance its glory. The spirit of our ancestors is a national treasure. The eternal life of a national treasure signifies the eternal life of the nation. The glory of a national treasure signifies the glory of the nation. This is an undeniable responsibility for modern people. Second, to bear the responsibility of innovation and creation for contemporary nations. No endeavor is immune to environmental influences, and every endeavor can create a new environment. When the old cannot cope, people are compelled to find ways to change and adapt to the new environment. The result of change is innovation, and the result of innovation is lasting existence. The saying, "When one is at the end of his resources, he changes; change leads to progress; progress leads to permanence," is the principle of all progress in the world. The responsibility of innovation lies with modern people. The significance of innovation lies in adding new life to the nation, infusing it with new blood, like grafting onto a flower or fruit tree to make the flowers more beautiful and the leaves more lush. Therefore, when innovation is necessary, modern people should take responsibility and implement it. Otherwise, the nation will age and inevitably fail to survive. Furthermore, as the saying goes, "The predecessors planted trees, the descendants enjoy the shade." We have received the legacy of our ancestors, and we must also create new assets. Only in this way can we be worthy of the nation and the country. Consider the ancient times when our ancestors faced natural difficulties and obstacles everywhere. They were not afraid of hardship, did not avoid danger, and did not shirk labor. With bare hands, they created a modern world. Their courage, their boldness, their ambition—truly as high as the mountains and as long as the rivers—fill later generations with admiration. Now that we have advanced to a new world, the natural dangers have been eliminated, and the tools created by humanity are almost complete. If we still do not strive to create new undertakings, we truly lack ambition. Take China as an example. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors used the most arduous methods to build the Great Wall and the Grand Canal. Now we have new manpower and new methods. Can we not use mechanical power to build one or two engineering projects that are even greater than the Great Wall and the Grand Canal? If we have the ability but do not do it, or if we do not have the ability to do it, then we are not striving. Are we willing to be a nation that does not strive? Third, to bear the responsibility of cultivating and nurturing future generations. The future of the nation should be the responsibility of the next generation, but it is the responsibility of modern people to ensure that every member of the next generation becomes a strong and elite component of the nation. Whether the future nation advances or lags behind, whether it is strong or weak, whether it is brave or cowardly, all depend on our cultivation, like planting flowers. Our responsibility is to water them. To grow good flowers, we must put effort into watering them. Therefore, how to educate young citizens, how to enrich their minds and bodies, and most importantly, how to ensure that every young citizen has the opportunity to receive education—these are all problems that modern people should take responsibility for solving.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army in New Guinea Establishes Self-Sufficient Sphere of Influence, Reinforcements Successfully Reach Peleliu Island <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - War situation on New Guinea Island and Palau Islands: ○ The Japanese army on New Guinea Island has recently formed a self-sufficient sphere of influence in the area west of Sarmi, monitoring enemy troop movements. In mid-August, they launched a surprise attack on enemy troops in the Teluk River estuary area east of Sarmi, breaking into enemy positions on the west bank of the Teluk River, killing over a thousand enemies and capturing over five hundred. The enemy troops, taken by surprise, were greatly embarrassed and abandoned the Masobe airfield, which they had painstakingly built on the west bank since late May, and retreated to the east bank of the river. In this area, the Japanese army has been fighting fiercely since the enemy troops landed near the Teluk River in late May, inflicting great damage on the enemy. Subsequently, they established a self-sufficient sphere of influence in the dense forests near Sarmi, enduring all hardships and waiting for an opportunity to move. Finally, in late August and mid-September, they suddenly launched the aforementioned surprise attack. Morale is extremely high, and they are waiting for a good opportunity. ○ Regarding the Palau Islands, there have been no major changes on the Peleliu Island front since the 24th. The Japanese garrison is currently firmly defending the northern side of the airfield and the southern line of the island. On the 24th, enemy troops in several groups broke into Japanese positions at several locations. The Japanese garrison responded with fierce attacks and unwavering struggles. In the afternoon, enemy aircraft became more active, repeatedly attacking Peleliu Island, Palau Island, and Koror Island. The number of attacking aircraft totaled approximately 209. Furthermore, the enemy fleet that previously invaded the Kossol Passage north of Palau Island had increased to over 50 ships by the afternoon of the 24th. On the 25th, enemy ships were very active between the Kossol Passage and Peleliu Island. The enemy landing forces on Peleliu Island, due to the valiant fighting of the Japanese garrison, suffered heavy casualties, so reinforcements were sent from the fleet in the Kossol Passage. On the 25th, two enemy hospital ships appeared in the waters east of Peleliu Island to collect the wounded and dead. In total, four enemy hospital ships have appeared during the daytime since the enemy began landing operations on the 25th, which also shows the extent of the enemy's losses on Peleliu Island. Furthermore, the details of the battle on Angaur Island are unclear, but judging from the situation on the night of the 24th, where flares were fired throughout the night and enemy naval guns never stopped firing, it can be seen that the morale of the Japanese garrison on the island is extremely high and they are still fighting. Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a report from the Central Pacific, the enemy troops on Peleliu Island are still heavily shelling Japanese positions, relying on defensive tactics to establish a long-term war system. The vanguard of the Japanese reinforcement troops successfully broke through enemy obstacles and infiltrated the island before dawn on the 23rd without suffering any losses. Japanese morale has been boosted. Southwest Pacific Base, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - During the day on the 23rd, a large enemy fleet, including surface ships, approached the vicinity of Morotai Island, with one detachment shelling the land.</p>

<p>Central China Front, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese naval forces in South China, in cooperation with the Japanese army, are actively clearing the minefields in the West River in order to open the waterway and attack key points on the West River. The Chongqing army in the Lingyang Gorge area east of Zhaoqing is also laying large numbers of mines and various drifting mines to defend against the Japanese advance. However, on the evening of the 12th, Japanese troops moving upstream from the vicinity of a certain location, in coordination with the army, broke through the Chongqing army's minefield in the Lingyang Gorge on the 17th and reached the Luoding River estuary 15 kilometers east of Deqing on the 23rd. Subsequently, they advanced to the west of Deqing. The Japanese army's gains in this area include clearing approximately 60 mines, capturing 104 mines, 34 floating mines, six boxes of explosives, and 90 large and small anchors. Japanese Front Line, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - After capturing Heshan and Xinxing on the south side of the West River, the Japanese army broke through dangerous areas and advanced westward. At 8:00 AM on the 24th, they completely occupied Luoding County (a key point between Yunfu and Wuzhou, 60 kilometers southwest of Yunfu). The mountainous area between Yunfu and Luoding is a well-known aluminum ore production area, especially the Dagangshan and Xiaogangshan areas, which produce up to 500 tons per year. At the same time, Yunfu is the center of other tin and gold mining areas. Furthermore, a Japanese assault unit occupied Liantan and attacked the Chongqing army south of Nanning. At noon on the 25th, they launched a surprise attack on the Chongqing army's mountain artillery unit near Daomenfu in Guangdong Province, achieving great results, including capturing two mountain guns, two machine guns, one wireless radio, and a large amount of other ammunition. The Chongqing army suffered 65 casualties, while the Japanese army suffered no losses.</p>

<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Burmese Front, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to reopen the supply line to Chongqing, the Chongqing army has recently gathered a large force on the Sino-Indian border, attacking Burma day and night.

Lieutenant General Kimura Heitaro, the highest commander of the Japanese army in Burma, issued a statement on the 25th as follows: "The recent war situation in East Asia is becoming increasingly fierce, and the decisive battle is imminent. The mission of the Japanese Burmese Expeditionary Force is also becoming increasingly important, but our great goal has not wavered. We are determined to make the new Burmese state as solid as a rock, resolutely strike the Chongqing army, which is clinging to its delusions, and further support the Indian National Army to achieve its great desire for independence and win the victory of the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, the US Office of War Information stated in a Pacific war report released on the 25th that the current situation of the war against Japan and the US Army, Navy, State Department, and economic officials acknowledge the difficulties of Pacific operations, and frankly warned the public that considerable sacrifices will still be required in the future. The main points are as follows: Judging from the current state of the US operational plan in the Pacific, once Germany is defeated, the anti-Axis forces will attack Japan with full force until Japan is destroyed. However, this will still take several years at least, because no changes can occur within Japan, so any expectations are impossible. Regarding the collapse within Japan, former Ambassador to Japan Grew has repeatedly introduced the Japanese character and spirit to the public, because Japan's long-term war can promote anti-Axis fatigue and confusion, so Japanese leaders also hope to prolong the war, causing the anti-Axis countries to consume a large amount of resources. The anti-Axis countries' war resources and fighting power are indeed superior to Japan, but this is only the United States. In addition, the morale of Japanese soldiers is extremely high. At the same time, Japan has not yet developed the resources of its occupied territories during the current war, but Japan's current production capacity is still the same as before the war. If the resources of the occupied territories are utilized, its production capacity will naturally be even stronger.</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Task of Cultural Figures—Answering the Criticism from Chongqing Cultural Figures <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tōyū</p>
<p>Currently, Japan and China share a common cultural phenomenon. That is, newspapers are filled daily with lengthy, repetitive, and dull articles. Regardless of the newspaper, they all publish headache-inducing propaganda. The "peace zone" is filled with [Great East Asia cliché] and [peace cliché], while the anti-Japanese war zone is filled with [anti-Japanese war cliché] and [communist cliché]. Though the form may be different, if it doesn't touch people's hearts, doesn't it lose the meaning of propaganda? Propaganda that lacks honesty and propaganda that lacks cultural conscience is useless except as toilet paper. But now it’s being used as toilet paper. Lin Yutang once said: [To regard literature as a slave of politics is to eliminate the free activity of the soul in literature and to destroy the meaning of literature. For example, political propaganda, which always assumes that it is praising politicians who pay for the newspaper every day, will never achieve the purpose of propaganda. Literature must primarily touch people's hearts. Life depictions should only be truthful so the literature won't be poisonous.] (Confucius Saw Nan cy By Lin Yutang 82-83). What is meant here by touching people's hearts is that writers express the reality that ordinary people feel but cannot express in a vivid way. Culture, whether in wartime or peacetime, must primarily strive in this direction. This is the task of cultural figures. Not long ago, I talked about this issue with a well-known cultural figure in the "peace zone," and he said that the wartime censorship system was too strict to write truly moving articles. However, I believe that it is far better for cultural figures to write something that moves people's hearts than to write the kind of propaganda that no one wants to read and is immediately used as toilet paper. Generally speaking, inspection agencies exercise their powers based on fixed laws, so it is difficult to keep up with social progress, especially the astonishingly rapid political progress we are seeing now. The reality of progress often exceeds conceptual forms, just as the clothes worn by a strongly developing child quickly become unsuitable for the body, and the old conceptual forms have become detached from reality. Because of their actual lives, the people feel this kind of real progress, so they urgently demand a clear explanation of the reality of progress. If cultural figures grasp this demand of the people, speak what they want to say but cannot, and tell them the reasons they want to know but cannot, sometimes it is necessary to break the inspection system prescribed according to the state before progress. To resolve this contradiction between cultural demands and the inspection system, inspection officials must constantly strive to grasp the progress of the situation, and cultural figures must face and approach the reality that can be expressed. If inspection officials do not strive to understand the evolution of the situation, but simply believe that inspection is such an important political task that it is auspicious to execute it according to legal interpretation, then rather than saying that they regard culture as a slave of politics, it would be better to say that they make politics a beggar. (Alas! Is this what is meant by the poverty of politics!) If all cultural figures are afraid of inspection officials, and no matter what the current objective situation is, they are cautious, as if walking on thin ice, fearing to violate the propaganda guidelines announced by the authorities, and completely form this kind of propaganda that is divorced from reality, then the people will soon become alienated from the authorities' policies. Recent political propaganda does not feel like it has a dazzling array of forms of expression, nor does it see that the people who write these articles have cultural and conscientious distress, so there is nothing that makes people think. Therefore, the cultural figures' inherent ability to roam freely is like a lion in a political zoo, sleeping very peacefully. Just as adults no longer feel interested in seeing lions in a zoo, people with a little thought are already tired of this kind of cliché. If cultural figures know this but dare not step beyond the established cultural policy, this is complete cultural idleness. If cultural figures feel an impulse to publish the current reality but dare not publish it for fear of the severity of the inspection system, then will there be any progress in the culture of a country? Can the inspection system itself still have hope for improvement? The cultural figures' courage and serious attitude in studying reality is an important factor in saving the fixity and stagnation of the inspection policy. The Classic of Filial Piety says: [If a father has a remonstrating son, then he will not fall into injustice], so if there are [remonstrating sons] in the cultural circles, then the country's cultural policy can advance on the road to good health. Having said that, I also know that it is very difficult to express reality in this era. This indeed requires full courage. Soldiers are prepared to disembowel themselves with a knife whenever necessary, and cultural figures should also be prepared to disembowel themselves with a pen whenever necessary. If they all have this determination, even if there are great obstacles, it will never be completely impossible to express reality. Since the beginning of history, there has never been a situation of complete freedom of speech in any era. Whenever cultural figures express the truth as it is, they always encounter certain restrictions. Trying to express the truth under such restrictions, then cultural conscience and publishing techniques are honed in the pain and frustration of tossing and turning. When surging emotions rush to the limits of expression, and when impurities are removed from the emotions, then the work can contain steel-like potential power and enduring brilliance. In summary, Apijun should also understand the general relationship between politics and culture. At the same time, I hope Apijun will re-evaluate my article based on what I have said above. An ancient saying says: [If everyone hates him, it must be rare; if everyone likes him, it must be examined], then if my article is [liked] by the Chinese [masses], there must be a reason for it. I know very well that my articles are not beautiful in their wording, and their theories are even less profound. Since there is something in my article that is [liked] by the [masses], perhaps that is my cultural conscience, that is, in the current restrictions, I always want to explain the Chinese reality with a nakedly sincere heart. Removing this [honesty] from my article is like cutting off [that thing] from Ximen Qing. Does Apijun not understand this cultural conscience and this honesty in my article? No, he understands it very well. He will clearly say: [But I still admire Yoshida Toyu a little, because he often says some honest words unintentionally]. He does not understand that I am straining my brain and squeezing out sweat, and deliberately want to tell the truth, but he only knows that I will say some truths [unintentionally]. I think that many readers of my article will definitely not raise the question of whether Apijun's criticism is correct, just as no one will mention whether an elephant has a nose. On this point, I think it is better to let the [masses] criticize it. Zigong asked: [What if everyone in the village likes him?] Confucius said: [It is not yet possible.] [What if everyone in the village hates him?] Confucius said: [It is not yet possible. It is better if the good people in the village like him and the bad people hate him.] (Lu Translation)</p>

I have already proposed three points yesterday, and today I solemnly propose another point: our colleagues in the journalism community must strictly practice self-discipline and self-examination in the future, and they must contribute the greatest strength to their work. In terms of personal morality, they must have the courage to overcome threats and inducements. Only in this way can we live up to the expectations of all parties. When we gather together again next time, we can prove the achievements of self-discipline of all colleagues. I hope everyone will work hard, and I wish everyone good health.] Then Minister Usami of the Japanese Embassy gave a speech, saying: [I am very grateful to Chairman Li of the China News Association for hosting this grand banquet today. I sincerely admire the official establishment of the China News Association with the assistance of all parties concerned. At the same time, I am also deeply grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of Minister Lin and the press relations officials in resolving all difficulties during the establishment process of the China News Association. In the current situation, guiding public opinion is extremely important. Although our newspapers have established their ideology, it is the responsibility of all of you to guide public opinion based on the established ideology. I hope that all of you in the press relations will pay special attention to this. With President Li leading your association, and with all of you being highly regarded in society, your line-up is strong and your future is unlimited. The Japanese side highly approves of the purpose of your association and is willing to do its best to assist the future development of your association. Under this major situation, your association bears a heavy responsibility. I hope that under the leadership of President Li, you will move towards this goal. I would like to take this opportunity to toast to your health.] Finally, Minister Lin gave a speech, briefly saying: [This time, the Chinese journalism community has established the China News Association in order to concentrate its strength and unite. I feel that the naming of the association is of great significance, because the "association" character has a heart on one side and three strengths on the other. This one heart and three strengths are very important. What is the one heart? What are the three strengths? Just now, President Li said that we must strictly practice self-discipline, that is, to examine our own psychology and work hard to contribute to society, the country, and the people. Everyone loves the country, the allied countries, and East Asia with one heart. The so-called three strengths are the strength of the people's struggle, the strength of government guidance, and the strength of allied assistance. We will use one heart and three strengths to seek a bright future for society. To what Minister Usami said, let us grasp the situation, work hard, and move forward, and the future is bound to be bright. I wish to take this opportunity to raise a glass to all of you to be upright, firm in your beliefs, and work hard, not only to seek the development of the association itself, but also to seek the completion of the war and the resolution of the situation.] The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until one o'clock, when they all happily dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Shanghai News Association Reception <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>In order to establish close ties with colleagues in the national journalism community and to thank Minister Lin Xuan and the press relations authorities of the Allied Powers for their assistance to the China News Association, the Shanghai News Association hosted a banquet at the Shanghai Businessmen's Club at 6:30 PM yesterday (the 26th) to entertain Minister Lin and the press relations authorities of the Allied Powers and all members of the China News Association. The association's standing board members, Jin Xiongbo and Lu Guangjie, warmly hosted the event. Guests from the Allied Powers included Intelligence Minister Kishi of the Embassy, Army Press Minister Izubuchi, Vice Consul Fukama, and Trustee Akahoshi. On the Chinese side, in addition to Director Xuan, President Li Sihao, Vice President Guo Xiufeng, Chen Binhe, Guan Yixian (represented by Chen Chongguang), and more than forty representatives of all members of the China News Association attended. First, Jin Xiongbo, the rotating standing board member of the association, delivered a welcome speech, briefly saying: [Minister Lin, Minister Kishi, distinguished officials, and gentlemen, today the Shanghai News Association is hosting a banquet with twelve minutes of sincerity to welcome all officials and all gentlemen, including President Li and all members of the China News Association. Since China has had newspapers, there has never been a national organization. Although major cities in China have made significant progress in the newspaper industry in the past twenty years, the disorganization of newspaper organizations in various places is an undeniable fact. At this time of the Greater East Asia War, which has reached the stage of decisive battle, we, as journalists standing on the fourth front for the sake of the country and for the sake of East Asia, should and closely need a strong and unified organization to fully exert the strength of our propaganda and reporting. Under the guidance of the Propaganda Department and the cooperation of the Allied authorities, the China News Association was officially established yesterday, with the highly respected Li Zanlao serving as president, and three experts who are currently engaged in the newspaper industry, Mr. Guo, Mr. Chen, and Mr. Guan, serving as vice presidents. In the future, the Chinese newspaper industry will be guided and assisted by the China News Association, and we will work together to complete our mission with unified will and unified steps. All members of our association express our sincere support for the establishment of the China News Association. Secondly, the industry leaders who attended this time are all authoritative journalists in China. Although many of them are meeting for the first time, it can be said that we have long admired them. Today, we have an opportunity to learn from them in person, so that members of our association can exchange opinions and gain many benefits. Although we will still return to our respective jobs in the future, this gathering will enable colleagues across the country to achieve the effect of sincere unity. Therefore, our association not only supports the China News Association, but also sincerely welcomes all gentlemen who attended the association. Today, our association has prepared the most simple meal in accordance with the principle of frugality. Please forgive us. Now, let us raise our glasses to wish the China News Association a bright future and all gentlemen good health,] etc. Then Mr. Chen Binhe delivered a reply speech on behalf of Mr. Li Sihao, President of the China News Association, briefly saying: [I am a director of the News Association, and at the same time, I feel it is difficult to deliver a speech on behalf of Mr. Li, President of the China News Association. In addition to representing the China News Association to express my gratitude to the Shanghai News Association for the reception, I also deeply believe that the Shanghai News Association will definitely follow the efforts of colleagues across the country in the future. I wish the China News Association a bright future, and the work spirit of the China News Association will be promoted and carried forward,] etc. During the banquet, the guests and hosts toasted and talked very happily, and the banquet did not end until after 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>A Tea Party with the Economic Community for Sincere Talks. Mr. Mitsuro, a leader in the journalism community of the Allied Powers and a managing director of Asahi Shimbun, recently came to China to investigate the actual situation of the Chinese people. He happened to be in Shanghai during the establishment of the China News Association. Mr. Mitsuro also took time out to attend the inaugural meeting of the association the other day, as the only special guest. According to Army Press Minister Izubuchi, Mr. Mitsuro usually wears Japanese kimonos. This time, he changed to Western clothes for the first time. Yesterday afternoon, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and President Chen of our newspaper hosted a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant to welcome him and invited people from the local economic community to have a round-table discussion.

<p>Mr. Mitsuro, distinguished gentlemen, today we welcome Mr. Mitsuro, and we are very honored to have you all attend. Mr. Mitsuro is the managing director of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun, has been working in the journalism industry for forty years, and is an authority in the Japanese public opinion circle. At the same time, he has a high status and is the most powerful among the people. He also once served in China twenty-seven years ago. He recently came to China to investigate and is very willing to listen to the opinions of the Chinese people. Today, we will take this opportunity to exchange opinions. I believe that only by fully communicating opinions, increasing understanding, and increasing emotions between the people of China and Japan can we fundamentally achieve the goal of goodwill. I believe Mr. Mitsuro also has the same feeling. Then, the two sides sincerely discussed the current economic problems in the Chinese peace zone and other people's livelihood issues, and frankly exchanged opinions. The discussion continued until 6:00 PM before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>A Ceremony Was Held at the Shanghai Shrine. Representatives of the three countries, Japan, Germany, and Italy, in this city will hold a commemorative ceremony at the Shanghai Shrine at 9:30 AM today (the 27th) to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Tripartite Agreement. Minister Usami will also host a banquet at the Cathay Hotel at 7:00 PM this afternoon to entertain representatives of the Axis countries in this city and express their determination to cooperate in the Axis war.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Japanese Consul General Yano Speaks <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Today is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. A prayer for the victory of the Axis countries will be held at the Shanghai Shrine at 9:30 AM. Representatives of Japanese and German military officers and civilians will participate at that time. Japanese Consul General Yano gave a speech entitled [On the Occasion of the Fourth Anniversary of the Conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance], as follows: Since the signing of the Tripartite Alliance Treaty four years ago, epoch-making events have occurred all over the world. Many countries have either declined or emerged. The future depends on the new institutions built on the basis of the Tripartite Alliance Treaty. During the four years of this treaty, many major military and political events have occurred. Now, it is about to reach a decisive point, and a very small number of arrogant countries that aim to foster their own power and adopt violence to dominate most countries still exist. On the other hand, a new order in which all countries, large and small, get what they deserve has also emerged. This is extremely clear. Around the Japan-Germany-Italy axis, there is a large gathering of the military, economic, and political forces of the three countries and their allies in both Europe and Asia. Currently, this gathering force is breaking the current situation under the control of Britain and the United States and is working hard to build a new world order based on the equality of sovereignty and the guarantee of security. In the past two years, we frankly admit that the Axis countries have suffered hardships, but since September 27, Showa 16 (1941), the memorable day of the establishment of this treaty, every year, we have been able to make great progress towards the completion of this great goal. Last year, Italy's withdrawal provided the anti-Axis camp with a good opportunity to publicize the collapse of the Axis, but to this day, the newborn Italy has restored the same major status as the Japan-Germany Axis countries, which is extremely gratifying. Just as we have been convinced in the past of the great progress of our mutual goals, we are sure that we will achieve success in the future. In my capacity as Consul General of the Japanese Empire, I confirm that the purpose of the Tripartite Alliance Treaty is to enable all countries to get what they deserve and to build a new world order based on lasting peace. I hereby express my determination to work harder and, at the same time, I am confident that we will be able to complete the mutual guarantee of security, the common happiness, and, in particular, the welfare and prosperity of mankind.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Case of Manipulating Gold Trading Was Declared Not Guilty Yesterday <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Security Office received a tip-off this spring that someone was manipulating gold trading. Therefore, they arrested more than 100 suspects one after another. After several investigations, the office believed that Tang Shiqing, Chen Zhonghan, Ni Huisheng, Wang Wenhan, Chen Zhiping, Gu Shihong, Su Changshu, Zhou Songyan, Song Yaodong, Zheng Huiquan, Yao Xingnong, Li Wenfu, Ji Ziqing, Zhou Changnian, Zhang Shichang, Jin Yibao, Bai Zongchun, Pan Qiaosheng and other 18 people were indeed suspected of committing crimes. The office transferred them to the local court to formally file a public prosecution. After several trials by the court, the sentencing date was yesterday. As a result, Judge Chuan Lanting ruled that each of the defendants had no criminal facts and were declared not guilty. However, Ni Huisheng and Wang Wenhai were convicted of gambling and were each fined 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Commemorative Ceremony for Defending East Asia Day Held Monthly at Entertainment Venues; Contributions Made <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the central government has stipulated the eighth of each month as Defending East Asia Commemoration Day. On this day, all entertainment activities nationwide are to be suspended to demonstrate the spirit of diligence, self-improvement, and cooperation in the war effort. From the capital to North China, South China, and Wuhan, this has been implemented successively. However, this city (Shanghai), due to slightly different circumstances, has not yet put it into practice. Recently, the Shanghai Branch of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee, considering that the implementation of this measure in Shanghai should be adapted to local conditions and appropriately modified, drafted the [Provisional Measures for Commemoration of Defending East Asia Day at Entertainment Venues in the Shanghai Special Municipality] and the [Measures for the Collection and Handling of Contributions]. These were submitted to the Municipal Government, which, after being submitted to the 25th Municipal Conference, resolved in principle to pass them and handed them over to the Propaganda Department, the Police Bureau, the Social Welfare Bureau, and the New Citizen Movement Branch for joint review. The two measures were appropriately revised, and a schedule of contribution ratios and the organizational charter of the Contribution Handling Committee were added. These were submitted to the Municipal Government and approved for implementation on the 22nd of this month, and reported to the central government for record-keeping. According to the provisions of the commemoration and contribution measures, various entertainment venues in the city's districts on Defending East Asia Commemoration Day (the eighth of each month), in addition to conducting various commemorative activities according to their nature, location, and equipment, should also contribute 10% to 30% of their total daily profits to the state. These contributions will be used to subsidize the promotion of the New Citizen Movement, the training of the populace, and publicity endeavors. The contribution ratios are determined based on the nature of the business, with movie theaters at 10%, drama theaters at 15%, Peking opera theaters, painting studios, and high-end Chinese and Western restaurants at 20%, other theaters, amusement parks, and cafes at 25%, and dance halls, "book apartments," escort agencies, massage parlors, jai alai courts, dog racing tracks, and horse racing tracks all at 30%. Regarding the collection and handling of these contributions, the Municipal Government has designated relevant agencies to organize a committee to handle the matter, appointing Liu Yangshan, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lu Ying, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, and Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Propaganda Department, as standing committee members; Cheng Jinxiu, Counselor of the Municipal Government, Zhou Yuying, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, and Yuan Shengkang, a member of the Baojia Committee, as committee members; and Xi Peiwen, Chief of the Secretariat of the New Citizen Movement Branch, as a member and Chief Secretary. Furthermore, the principle is that these contributions should be paid voluntarily. Each month, various entertainment venues will hand over their contributions to their respective trade associations or fraternities for collection and remittance. It is reported that the Contribution Handling Committee has already held its first meeting and decided to begin handling the matter in October. Currently, it is scheduling meetings with various entertainment venue trade associations to discuss implementation.</p>

<p>The National Commercial Control Association previously received letters and telegrams from various industries requesting assistance due to restrictions on the transport of tea, paper, bamboo, wood, oil, and other materials at the Hangzhou Station of the Central China Railway Company. The Association forwarded these requests to the Executive Yuan and sent telegrams to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, urging them to negotiate with relevant parties to stop the restrictions. The Executive Yuan instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Ministry of Industry to negotiate and report on the matter. The Ministry of Industry also dispatched personnel to liaise with the Allied Embassy. It has been decided that, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement, the control of materials subject to control should be gradually transferred to merchant self-governance control organizations for responsible handling. Regarding the restrictions on material movement by the Allied forces in Hangzhou, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is negotiating, and the Allied Embassy is contacting the General Headquarters and instructing the consulate in Hangzhou to negotiate locally.
