<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>陳友仁先生餘話吉田東祐</h3>
<p>陳友仁先生死了。所謂蓋棺論定，個人的眞價值須在身後方定。但在中國國民革命尚未成功的今日，對於他的政治行動率爾加以論列，則是輕率，况且他在國民革命中扮演了怎樣的角色，叉是人言言殊。可是，凡會接近他的人，對於他的人格，特別對他具有中國人之聞罕見的廉潔品性，持異論者頗少。至如「亞洲內幕」一書的作者約翰根室，雖曾簡單地將他批評為「職業的政治家」，然而，根室自己從未與陳氏見面，不過據拾會　焉過陳友仁訪問記的美國新聞記者希恩（參照其所著「個人的歴史」）的牙慧而已。眞知陳氏者，都知道他是十分誠意的人，距離所謂「職業的政治家」的概念甚遠。茲舉一例，足以表明陳氏人格感人之一端。</p>
<p>陳氏臨終前曾對他的夫人說：「我的墳基在國人的記憶中，我死之後，絕對不要築墓。遺體焚灰，投於黃浦江或大海中！」並堅囑葬禮務須簡單，在目前人民生活困苦的時代，難為別人化錢之事，一概避免。花圈之類，一槪謝絕。正如報章所載，曾三度出任外交部長的　氏，身後却很蕭條。但是兩位仰慕其人的格朋友，聚集十萬元為治喪費。（後來陳夫人悉數退還）治喪委員便與某殯儀館接洽葬禮細目。殯儀館答允用七萬五千元辦理。到了第二日，館方忽然聲言變更。治喪委員以為殯儀館因為陳友仁氏的喪事，所以想要更多錢。不料該館的經理却說。「原來雖議定全部費用七萬五千元，但聽說是陳友仁先生的喪事，所以二萬五千元就够了。因為中國人中，誰不知道陳友仁先生是爭回漢口英租界為中華民族吐氣的偉人，我們無論如何在他身後事上盡些心力。」治喪委員聽了這席話，十分感動。</p>
<p>到了五月廿二日，陳氏的告別式終了，翌日再到殯儀館去付給二萬五千元時，經理又說：「且慢，先前雖說定二萬五千元，我覺得不如此說，也許不需要我們永　這次喪事，所以不得不說。其實我們自始就準備不接受費用的。」治喪委員對於這樣厚而且誠的人情，不禁感動得熱淚盈眶。</p>
<p>陳發仁氏的晚年並不顯　，但他死後尙有這樣可貴的同情者——不僅如此，就是診病的醫師也不收分文醫藥費用——這是證明陳氏人格影饗於中國國民精神的良好材料。在中國，甚至有借藉父母喪事的名義，搜括金錢的政治家。道輩人死時，我想決不會有這樣的同情者吧！（吉譯）</p>
<h3>悼陳友仁先生</h3>
<p>— 張素民</p>
<p>陳友仁先生是在本月二十日淸晨三時去世的，恰巧我因公在京，當晚即接上海電話，報告這個不祥消息，我總不相信，我以為像他這樣的好人是不應該死。所以我在二十一日早　輕打電話到上海去問，那個不祥消息果然證實了。打完了電話，接到當日的南京各早報，拿來一看，陳友仁先生的去逝，果然成了新聞了。</p>
<p>我在二十一日的這一天，整個想念陳友仁先生。我想念他的理由，是:他是一個政論業和思想家，他同時是一個愛國志士和忠實的學者。我和他，雖有在朝在野之分，然而認為他是不可多得的益友。許多留學生同國之後，不是官僚化，就是市儈化。可是陳友仁先生始終是書生本色，置生命財貨於度外，而時時不忘研究世界問題與國家問題。他的意見，儘管我有不贊同的地方，然他的熱誠，他的思想，不能不令人起敬。</p>
<p>陳光生生長在外國，不通中國文字，確是他惟一的缺恨，然其愛國思想和救國計劃，遠在一般能考古塡詞做詩的文人之上。我以為他如能再活五年，他對於國家社會，必能有更多的貢獻，不講別的，他正在起草「全民政治」一書，倘天假以年，使那都著完成，豈不是一個很大的貢獻嗎？</p>
<p>我記得有一次，我供給他我以前寫的一部害，他看了之後，承他恭維對我說：「我年老了，你年紀還輕，你既學有根底，從政之餘，應不忘讀書，俾將來對社會有史大的貢獻。」我聽了，雖有點慚愧，然對於讀書從此更加努力。可惜陳先生今己作古，以後想找一個能說這種話的朋友，實不容易了！</p>
<p>總之，陳友仁之死，是我國社會的一大損失。</p>
<h3>伊姆法爾盆地內數萬英軍陷危局集存軍需物資亦消耗殆盡</h3>
<p>仰光二十七日巾央社電　印度前棧日軍，於三月二十入日將哥希馬·伊姆法爾公路密林附近進斷後，四月十三百將比先渡爾之西爾其亞公路完全遮斷，逾後伊姆法爾盆地之敵第四軍，惟有仰仗空中補殺，苟延殘喘，以約可供數月使用之集存物資，抵抗日軍之猛攻。開戰兩月餘，敵方彈藥消耗甚鉅，日印軍已獲得大量團獲品，敵方因已屆雨季，同空中補給頗欠圓滑，今彈藥然料食糧等極感不足，情勢頗為緊迫。敵方現於摩列西本及頓扎恩附近集存軍需物資，伊姆法爾之主力，更在該地西北地區堆積若干月份用之軍需品，凡此均為敵軍之雨季對策，然　列西本及頓扎恩兩前綫之物資，悉為日軍鹵獲，或被焚燬，僅伊姆法爾西北地區之物資尚在殘存。過去該方面之補給，乃利用伊姆法爾及巴列爾機塲擊，自西爾其亞，加爾各答方面實行空輸，但巴列爾之中南北三機場，已人於日重砲射攀閱內，又伊姆法爾北方堪古拉頓基之敵機塲亦被炸毀，已不能使用，古恩比北方敵機塲渭行路，因受雨浸，現僅伊姆法爾附近之西南北三機場尚能使用，然因已入雨季，故亦無甚大價值。今伊姆法爾盆地內，敵之數萬大軍已陷於重大危局，敵第四軍現正急向蒙特巴頓求援，幷命令前方節約彈藥。又食糧亦自四月底減半，食用品可延長時日，刻伊姆法爾西北地區集存之物資無多，日軍復　縮包團網，故敵軍甚感狼狽。</p>
<p>三日空戰中日機隊戰果</p>
<p>仰光二十七日中央社電緬甸方面日空軍，連日協力馬尼布爾方面陸上軍，與敵方展開决戰，二士二日進攻伊姆法爾時，在烏克魯爾北方上空，有敵戰鬥機二架前來邀擊，常為日機擊落，餘　述在某地附近，復發現敵P51型機兩架，即射擊之，使之起火遁去，旋有敵P38型機十六架，復來邀擊，再展開熾烈空戰，是役擊落敵機三架。又是以益曾有敵P51日型機四架來製日軍某基地，為日陸上防空隊擊落一架。日戰關機隊曾於二十四日攻擊伊姆法爾，幷將來襲比先波爾之敵機二架擊落，另一編隊日機曾突入伊姆法爾敵機塲，低空掃射，正欲起飛之敵B25型機曾受重創。又日戰鬥機隊會於二十五日在伊姆法爾上空與哨戒中之敵噴火式機五十架交戰，擊落其五架，是日亦有敵P51型機十餘架來襲日軍某基地，為日陸上防空部隊擊落一架，於此三日問，日方損害僅自炸一架，尚有一架未返基地。</p>
<p>仰光二十七日中央社電阿拉坎戰綫方面之古爾加兵及印兵，嬮戰情緒日趨濃厚，五月五日會在布其頓西方之役與戰友數人參加印度國民軍，同時英軍為確保守備綫，會誤人友軍陣地砲擊，此事係由旁遮普省兵員名為諾開烏者口中透露，而敵陣營內戰意喪失之情形，於此亦已充分表現。</p>
<h3>對豫作戰將兵　日皇賜勅語　大本營發表洛陽戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電日大本營發表，日大元帥陛下曾於二十七日召見參謀眸總長，對中國派遺軍總司令官賜勳語次：於河南方面作戰之我軍將兵，　戰奮國，能以寡兵擊潰衆敵，神速達成作戰目的，對作戰全局貢獻甚大，朕深為嘉尚。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電大本營二十七日下午五時發表洛陽攻略戰一役，所獲戰果，已判明者如次：收容渝車屍體四三八六具，俘盧八二三〇名，鹵獲品有各種火砲七十四門，輕重機槍二〇一挺，手槍二二○○枝，各種彈藥一七九〇〇〇發，旦方損失陣亡入〇人。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電河南日軍於洛陽之役所　戰果，迄今已判明者，計渝軍葉屍四三入六具，被俘六二三〇名，日軍由獲各種火砲七十四門及槍械·彈藥多數。爰據守洛陽之淪軍為隸屬於第十四軍之第九十六師及第十五軍之第六十四師，第六十五師等，共計三師兵力，是時日軍因渝軍不接受勸告，逐菸二十四日下午一時開始總攻擊，經激戰十九小時，卒於佔領。渝軍之損失，除日軍所發表者，尚有若千於潰逃時溺死於城外南部之洛河中，而日軍僅陣亡八十名。總計自河南作戰以來，所獲之戰果如次：渝軍棄屍三萬九千一百八十六具，被俘一萬五千六百三十人，日軍鹵獲火砲二百入十門，重輕機關槍九百二十六挺，步槍一萬三千二百枝，由此戰果觀之，足目渝軍損失之大矣。</p>
<p>洛陽秩序　逐漸恢復</p>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電洛陽自事變後即成為渝方河北戰綫之作戰根據地，設有第一戰區司令部省政府及渝各部之辦事處等。此次展開作戰後，住民紛紛逃避，自前年始，生活必需品已被統制。四月初之物價，廳一斤爲五十元，砂糖一斤二百元，麵粉一斤十八元，一人每月生活費達三千元，且黑市橫行，拉車者日入二百元，一切紊亂不堪，現已進入更生之途，該地已一變而為和平地區云。</p>
<p>日機襲長沙</p>
<p>漢口二十七日中央社電日空軍會於二十五日下午七時，以轟炸戰鬥機聯合編隊，急襲長沙，冒敵軍之激烈對空砲火，轠炸長沙東方渝車事設施，全機安然返防。</p>
<p>漢口二十七日中央社電駐渝美空軍P40型戰鬥機八架，言於二十六日上午十一時閏來襲擊北省荊門，經日方這擊後，擊落其一架，其他均被擊退。日據則已全部基地。</p>
<p>中青總團部徴歌複選竣事</p>
<p>南京二十七日中央社常中國靑少年總團部黴求大東亞靑少年進行曲，收到投稿三十六件，二十五日舉行初潠會議，錄取朱怡夫等六篇，二十七日複選第一名朱怡夫，第二名與復旦，第三名張錫魁，即日電送日本大東亞靑少年團協力會事務同，決選六月一日發表。</p>
<p>華南日軍交還敵產</p>
<p>廣州二十七日巾央社電明　邦日本為尊重我主權，將敵產先後交還我國管理，日華南軍當局前已先後將市內敵軍移交我方。至於軍管理中之粵賓各地舊渝方財產三百七十件，日前亦已進行移管事備，現一切事項已辦理完竣。於本月二十五日巳將移管月錄交與我當局，今後對此等產業之軍營與發發、當有莫大這難待。</p>
<h3>滿定期舉行　首次使館會議　謀中滿國交緊密提携</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電中滿國交自國府參戰以來，益形緊密，無論政治方面，經濟方面，皆共同攜手，向大東亞戰爭勝利之途邁進。茲滿洲國為謀中滿國交進一步之提攜起見，特訂於六月八·九·十·三日由滿我交部主持，於南京滿駐華大使館舉行第一次使領館會議。該會出席者，計外交部方面有大江政務司長，松岡，竹內兩參事長，及岸山，田中兩理事官。駐羣使能方面，有駐華呂大使，三浦公使，張參事官，上海總領事館葉總領事，河島領事及天津小濱代理總領事以下靑島·濟南·各領事館關係人員。其討論中心有如下三點：　中滿國交推進方策。　巾滿兩國政治經濟緊密化之具體方策。　使領館之配置，及使領館相亙間之調整。按滿洲國駐華大使館開設以來，其使館會議，此為初次，故對中滿國交加强提携上，賞有無限期待。</p>
<p>田尻公使赴菲履新</p>
<p>東京廿七日中央社電日新任駐菲公使田　愛義氏，今日已啟程赴任</p>
<p>哈爾賽調任新職</p>
<p>里斯本廿七日中央社電海通社訊，華盛頓社息：反軸心西南太平洋海軍總司令哈爾賓海軍少將，現已另斷新命，惟調任何職尚不得而知。據悉，哈氏近會訪問業特巴噸上將於其總部。</p>
<h3>中部太古洋　日防衛堅强　美機空襲大鳥悼受挫</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電敵美益曾於二十。二十一日兩日來襲南烏島，復於二十四日再以機動部隊攻大烏烏附近海面，自最至午反覆空襲達七次之多，來襲機數累達二百八十架。駐屯該島之日軍會奪起迎擊，當擊落其二十架，擊毀兩架，是役日方被害極輕微，僅有若干建筑物遭受損害。良以最近敵在中部太平洋之戰法，係在以機動部隊發動攻勢，以空軍作速續之反復攻擎，但日軍守備部隊之堅陣地則並未因此而稍有動搖，於此可見口軍前綫防衛堅强之一斑。</p>

<h3>慶祝日本海軍節任海部長廣播詞</h3>
<p>中央社訊　今日為盟邦日本第三十九屆海軍紀念日，同時也就是和我們東亞民族第一次保衛東亞，排斥由種人勢力東亞戰爭的三十九屆紀念日。三十九年前，正是日本在世界上崛起的時候，日本的海軍，在海相山本大將運籌之下，毅然以東鄉平八郎任艦隊司令長官。他知道日俄兩國不免要兵我相見，這樣的决定，纔是萬全的準備。明治一二十七年二月入日夜半，一個晴天霹靂，日本的艦隊，以疾風暴雨之勢，奇裂旅順。事起倉猝，帝俄的海軍驚惶失措，無法作妥善的防攀。頃刻之間，帝俄的主力艦巡洋艦多艘，巳遺擊沉，還有巨艦多艘受了重創，但是還沒有將帝俄在太平洋的勢力全部消滅。第二天二月九日拂曉，日本艦隊復第二次猛攻旅順，這一次的作戰，較第一日士爲激烈。日本艦隊作戰奮勇進展之速，眞可以</p>
<p>驚天動地</p>
<p>而泣鬼神，在戰術方面購，這實在是閃電戰術第一次的成功。東亞的制海權全歸於日本，日本陸軍方得安全輸送而登陸。至翌年明治三十八年五月二十七日，帝俄波羅的海艦隊復捲土重來，與日本聯合艦隊會戰於日本海。在聖將東鄉元帥統率之下，由其　妙錢術，指揮得宜，乃於二十七二十入兩日間，使波罷的海艦隊粉碎無遣。至此日本遂一躍而成為世界上最强的海軍國，此種偉大歷史性的戰績，創有史以來的新紀錄。為着紀念不屈不撓光以燦爛的日本海軍，因此日本乃定五月二十七日爲海軍紀念日，還是海軍紀念日的由來，自大東一亞戰爭爆發以來，日本海軍　　迭建殊勳</p>
<p>考其致勝之因，第一精神訓練的嚴格，這種精神力，就是帝國海軍的傳統精神，忠君愛國，視死如歸，只有國家，沒有自己。在兵士則洛血犧牲，在將校則大公無私，日本海軍自負謂人的魚雷，誠非誇大。第二技術訓練的嫻熟，日本海軍爲培養技術人員，設有海軍大學，海舉兵學校，機關學校，經理學校，砲術學校，軍醫學校，水雷學校，通信學校，空海學校，工機學校等種種技術專門之學校。深造研究，分門別類，使均能平衡發展，且收分工合作，事半功倍之效。第三艦船質量之充賣與改善，自日俄戰爭迄於大東亞戰爭，三十錄年，日本海軍建設，無日不在發展之中，突飛猛晉，尤其是質量的充實與改善，其程度實非世人所能夢想。惟以　　軍事秘密</p>
<p>直到現在還不能發表。實在今日日本海軍噸位之大性能之强已超越了英美，由此看來，日本海軍之成功，並非偶然，固有其四十年奮門之勝史，四十年苦練之精神，舉國一致，實視海軍、方才得有今日。我國海軍自甲午以後，五十年來營在睡眠狀態，自汪主席和運開始，還都以來，始圖積極建設，同時盟邦海軍當局，以最大努力來協助，本人沗爲新中國海軍建設之責任者，於領袖統率少下，自當壎勳奪發。我三　理一每岸固需要海軍，即東亞共同保衛之大任，亦須要中國有海軍。回憶開邦初期海軍建設之困難，吾人前途實至光明，吾人之心亦益堅決，一切建設營當借鏡於盟邦。今逢盟邦日本三十九屆海軍紀念日，謹掬滿腔敬意。祝日本海運昌陸，大東亞戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>緩和米糧統制京市民極重視　　南京廿七日中央社電關於米糧統制限度緩和後，對京滬兩市市民食來，幷制定臨時措置綱要，以期充裕兩市民食。關於該項臨時措置綱要中，南京區之實施細則，如寧設護照頒發處，確定征購米之之價格，以及配給制度之如何改善等問題，目下賞業部·市政府·市商會。米統會京辦車處等有關各方面，正在維密商討中，約於下週初即可正式公布。關於此事，現全市市民無不深切注視，藍此舉非但攸關全市民食前途，更足影鬱於國計民生者至鉅且大，故愈望當局對該項實施細則加以詳細研討，務使都市農村兩受其益。尤其對於征購對象之明確公布，征購價格合理規定，以及經辦簽發護照人員，「事實際片購工作人員之廉正公明，更為不容忽視。故對今後經辦人負之懲罰辦法，深盼亦有嚴格之規定，庶可一掃以往之烏烟癥氣，而使生產與消費兩者問，均沾實惠，以符當局此次緩和統制之最終目的及平衡價格，暢通來源，進而安定民生，增强戰力之旨趣也。</p>

<h3>盟邦日本海軍紀念節特輯之八　日俄戰爭的敎訓宮治</h3>
<p>戰術上的敎訓</p>
<p>日本海軍於日俄戰爭中獲得大勝一事，不但在國際上日本因擊敗世界有名强國而得列為六大海軍國之一，且證明向被蔑視為劣等人種的東洋人也決不亞於西洋人。在喚起了一幹就幹吧」的自覺這一點上，於日本的歷史上固無論，即在世界的歷史上，也發生了很大的變化。這從海軍的立場上想起來，也是很要緊的事故。</p>
<p>正如日本海軍將日淸戰爭作為試騐速力較快的巡洋艦價值的試騐臺，在日俄戰爭中也試騐了日淸戰爭以後所成新型軍艦的威力。</p>
<p>尤其是日本海的海戰，因為日本是用速力武裝一律的艦隊和俄國參差不齊的艦隊決戰，所以此戰實為表現艦隊各艦力量均等時有多大威力的實據。世界海軍專家雖早在以前即已提倡這個理論，但誰也想像不到會有如此鮮明的證據。</p>
<p>羅塞斯德溫斯基提醫（Admiral　Roshestvensku）於明治三十八年（一九〇五年）四月八日椗泊法蜀印度支那的喀姆朗　時，其艦隊尚屬整齋，但不知為了何故，他在該處等待尼綫卡脫夫少將　下的第三艦隊到來，足足費了一月以上的時日。而且來援的第三艦隊並不怎讓優良，不過是舊式軍艦的集合而已，在不利之時，反足為整個艦隊之累，適點早為一殺人土所悉。</p>
<p>的確，率領這支堂堂的大艦隊，航行一萬五千湮的大洋而抵此處羅提，　眞是一個可贊美的將材，但其最後希望有更多軍艦的欲望，則可說是日本海軍軍人所無的俄國海軍的氣質吧。這不是表面强硬內心怯弱的特有性情的流露嗎？東鄉司令長官也批評道：</p>
<p>「羅塞斯德溫斯基提督確是非凡的人物。統率那樣的大艦隊，跋涉一萬五千連的畏途，其手段和苦心，實不平常。</p>
<p>可惜他沒有勇往直前而早日達到目的地的心意，徒然躊躇逡巡。」</p>
<p>總而言之，這切實敎訓我們戰時躊躇最為犯禁。同時也說實艦隊決不可集合不整齊的艦種而成的理論。</p>
<p>美國馬澳提督（Admiral　Mahan）批評日本海的大勝利說：</p>
<p>一日本海軍的勝利托庇於集中戰術。」</p>
<p>東鄉司令長官以全艦隊待機於對馬水道；亦為日本海軍勝利的原因。這敎訓我們在將來的海戰中「應傾整個艦隊的全力於濯戰」。可知戰爭時決不可以分散戰力·</p>
<p>裝備上的敎訓</p>
<p>日本海海戰在戰斯上旣與我們以如此的敎調，在軍艦的建造上·武裝上也引起了大變革。</p>
<p>第一蹬明主力艦的主砲威力在決定海戰的勝負上是如何的重要。日淸戰爭時雖已明白主砲的重要，但像日本海海戰那樣的實例，可設是前所未見。「三笠」以下各戰艦的十二時主砲怒吼之處，俄國艦隊的精銳相繼沈入海底。決定日本海海戰之成敗的，便是第一日主力艦的巨砲陣。</p>
<p>第二是關逐艦的威力。從第一日夜到第二日晨，　逐和水雷艇的夜襲，擊遺了俄國艦隊抗戰力的根本。</p>
<p>由此二事證明了主力艦的主砲應艦可能多裝，又和艦隊共同行動用於大洋上的决戰中的，水雷艇是太小了，而且在偵察·通信·速絡方面，也是驅逐艦更有力一些。</p>
<p>第三是潛水艇的威脅。當俄將馬洛夫卡（Makaroy）在旅順港外與其乘艦「彼得洛巴烏洛斯克」同命時，俄國旅順艦隊的將士為了日本潛水艇之故，大起恐慌。又當日本「初瀨」號於一九〇四年五月十五日在老鐵山東南方觸雷沈沒時，即在沈毅的日本海軍兵員問，目覩此世界有數的戰艦沈沒時，也沒有不感到動搖的，且有人以為這是俄國潛水艇的技倆所致。</p>
<p>又在驚嘆日本海海戰空前大捷的人士中，也有聲稱日本艦隊的勝利在於秘密擁有潛水艇。</p>
<p>但那時潛水艇尚未達到實用之境。明治三十七年（一九〇四年），日本海軍始從美國購人霍閳特型的潛水艇五艘。因此，日俄兩國雖然皆未使用潛水艇，但此項新型武器之受當時各國專門家的注目，則屬事實。而這種小巧的軍艦所具的無形威脅，頗不爲小，結果潛水艇的研究遂非常盛行。</p>
<p>决心建設海軍</p>
<p>再則，日俄戰爭使日本海軍下了建軍以來的量大决心。</p>
<p>明治四年（一八七一年）明治天皇在集議院垂詢充實海軍軍備問題時，該院覆奏道：「軍艦應由我作，向彼收實則不可也。」其後，日本的造船術雖然非常進步，但尙不測建造巡洋艦一類的軍艦。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭開始以前，日本政府曾向央國定造一萬六千噸的戰艦一嘆島」「香取」兩艘。戰爭爆發時，兩艦均已造成，照理應即交付日本海軍，但英方為了某種理由却未照預業而行。</p>
<p>據故海軍大將齊藤實（當時任海軍次官）之言，「初瀕」號沉沒時在日本內地會大起恐慌，關於如何補充的問題，甚至召開明治天皂親臨的御前會議。會議中决定補充的軍艦必須在日本建造。可是造船的技術官却一點沒有能用己手建造的自信，惟因即在御前會議决定，自無不行之理，於是不得不硬着頭皮幹去，在吳港的海軍工廠造成了「生駒」和「筑波」。它們和當時世界　造成的戰艦一樣，是備有十二吋主砲四門，六時副砲十二門，速力二十節半的裝甲巡洋艦。而其艦首則廢去迄至那時為止的軍艦所其的衞角，改爲水切型，看起來殊為輕快，且其速力超越戰艦，武裝亦興戰艦相將，惟裝甲較薄而已，所以世界海軍專家見之頗為驚嘆。</p>
<p>在日淸戰爭發生之前，日本海軍對於松島級三景艦的獨特設計，亦嘗發驚他界，而這次則不食設計，並自己動手製造。這樣，日本海軍便成為不必依賴外國的獨立的海軍。日本海軍不但獨立起來，並且迎頭趕上，日益發展。（此後日本艦艇在外國製造者祗有戰艦「金剛」和驅遂艦「浦風」二艘而巳。）</p>
<p>綜合送些敎訓而表現出來的是什麼呢？第一便是戰艦多裝主砲，並使副砲口徑和全砲相似。例如繼「生訽」「筑波」之後，在橫須賀工廠所造的戰艦「國糜」、在吳工廠所處的「安藝」，皆裝有十二吋主砲四門，十吋副砲十二門。這種主砲和副砲口徑相差不大的軍艦，稱為二巨砲混用艦。而其副砲的配置，因在左右兩舷各置六門，所以交戰時不論在任何一邊的絃側，都可以用主砲四門副砲六門合計十門的巨砲應戰。（未完待紙）（吉：本文摘譯「軍艦史話」近代篇之一章）</p>
<h3>海軍生活的一天</h3>
<p>日本的孩子，喜歡看海，並且喜歡畫軍艦。可見從小已有了「海國日本」這一種堅强意志了。小學一年級的學生，拿到紙筆，立刻可以隨便畫出一隻軍艦，不過所賓的是明治年代的軍艦，在昭和年代看來，太奪式了。今日的軍艦，並不像小學生們所畫約那樣簡單，是科學的結晶，一切都是機械化，科學化的。且軍人精神也比昔日更高漲充沛。靑年們視死如歸的軍艦生活，的確是潑潑而當於朝氣。</p>
<p>他們的生活是紀律化的，在二十四小時的刻板生活中，養成了偉大的海軍軍人。</p>
<p>早晨的功課</p>
<p>天色未明，報告時鐘的值班兵，向輪值將校報告：</p>
<p>「當值將校—還有一刻鐘全體耍起床了。」</p>
<p>這時是五點四十五分。於是輪值將校，令傳令兵通知發電機室，全艦點起了電燈，甲板士官出來了。甲板士官是附屬於艦長及副總長的士官，管理艦內雜務的青年少尉。</p>
<p>鐘鳴六下，傳令矣徒傳聊管中大聲通知；</p>
<p>「大家結東鈞床。」「大家收好釣床。」「大冢準備體操。一</p>
<p>一會兒，甲板上排了隊，一二三四地開始海軍設操了。道大約是十分鐘。接羨，是兩舷直鼙列的號令。</p>
<p>兩舷直者，是除了值現兵，從兵及有其他職務以外的水兵之總稱。關於訓練和教育以外的艦上工作，大槪都是遣兩舷直做的。</p>
<p>兩舷直整除以後，輪值將校命令：</p>
<p>「從各分隊出來三名。」</p>
<p>這三名一個在後甲板上張天冪，二葛洗露天甲板。經過了三十分鐘，天色也已大亮了，下令洗臉。矣士們盒了約二公升的眞水，刷齒漱口洗臉。洗完臉，香噴噴的期飯拿上來了。港上，小火輪嘆噬噗噗地戰回了登陸的船員·道是昨天吃過夜飯後登陸休養的船員歸艦了。</p>
<p>經過了一番寒喧，「準備食事」的喇叭聲鄉了，開始吃早飯。從起床到吃早飯，大約須一小時。</p>
<p>吃過早飯，休息三十分鐘，掃除居住甲板。</p>
<p>軍艦上的田板有二種·一種是露天田板，俗呼上田板。在那下面，船員居室的甲板稱居住甲板。</p>
<p>掃除甲板後，就收拾爲軍艦之生命的各種武器</p>
<p>八點缺十五分，「衛兵隊準備」。</p>
<p>七點五十五分，摔軍艦旗箱的水兵與下士官在艦尾的旗笙下準備升旗。　樂隊在前，衛矣隊在後，向艦尾整列。艦長與副艦長也出來了。</p>
<p>入時正。「立正」的喇叭聲響了。全體停止活動，向艦尾鵲立。軍樂長揮起指揮棒，信號兵吹號，同時，輪值將校下令：</p>
<p>「升旗！」</p>
<p>衝兵隊舉槍，軍樂隊淾着國歌。全體舉手注目，軍艦瑛冉冉地上升，在晨風中飄蕩。</p>
<p>說到上下午的日課，各日不同，且因各艦的任務而有異。大槪上午到十一時半，下午從十三點一刻到四時爲課業時間。</p>
<p>而上午十一時四十五分爲中膳時間，到十三點中分預備上課的五分鐘前，為休息時間。</p>
<p>下午的課業告終，十六時十五分，用晚膳。如在夏季，那時候太陽還高照在西半天，到明天早上，不是要鋑出病來嗎？可是那不用担心·太陽一落山，大家都歡天喜地的登陸籍遊了。</p>
<p>課餘的遊</p>
<p>下午十六時四十五分一，三五成羣的穿了筆挺的軍服，着了擦亮的皮鞋，齊集在後甲板上。這特許登陸嬉遊的兵士們，有接送的火輪，到明天早上朝飯前，必須歸艦。他們是輪班的，下士官間日一次。兵長與上等兵四日一次，一等兵六日一次。這稱為入湯登陸，意息是上岸洗濯海上的污垢。</p>
<p>登陸員上去後，就校習各種別科，如手旗，體操，柔道，劍道，槍劍術等。太陽快下山了，下令降旗，儀式與朝晨晨升旗時一樣隆重藥重。同時，艦上開始燃點。</p>
<p>此後的時間，是一天中最閑暇的時候，大家到酒保室裹去聊天，吃酒，水藥，買些肥皂，便箋。牙粉等日用品。</p>
<p>到十九時四十五分，放下釣床，準備就寢。二〇時止，最後掃除申板，二〇時卅分，巡檢喇叭傳通了艦內的每個角落。甲板士官跟着副艦長巡視證內各部。這時候，兵士們都在雪白的毛巾被中做他們的故鄉之夢了。</p>
<p>在平時，巡檢以後，一天的日程就算告終。但全體軍艦決不完全高枕就寢。受艦長命令的當值將校，副值將校，衞兵隊，信號兵，無綫電兵，機關兵，都輪值看守自己的職位。夜中如有急變，二三分鍛之內全體可以起床整列甲板。</p>
<p>廿二時，軍港及各軍艦與陸上斷絕交通，十一時艦內熄燈，僅剩前甲板與舷門的小燈。以後便是寂靜的軍港之夜，祗聽得警戒艦內的值班兵璞蹊往來的靴聲。至午前三時左右，當值的機械兵，主計兵起來了。準備全體船員的朝餐。</p>
<p>上起艦長，下至一等兵·每天二十四小時中，都在送嚴格的軍紀下，打成一片，過着大家庭般溫醫的生活，以備明日的戰鬥。</p>

<h3>有意義的紀念</h3>
<p>昨天是盟邦日本第三十九屆海軍節，上海新聞聯合會發起運動會，以資慶祝·跑馬廳的田徑賽，逸國的足球賽，西靑會的籃球排球乒乓賽，三處參加頭衆達入萬人以上，盛况熱烈。</p>
<p>我們感覺，以運動會紀念日本海軍節，有兩種意義：第一，從運動競技提倡體育，從提倡體育鍛鍊體格，以速動會喚起大衆注意健全體格。一方面，日本海軍自官佐至士兵，每個人都有强健的體魄，就是從辜裴汪重於體育鍛鍊得來的·誠如近藤少將致詞中云：「健全之精轉，寓於健全之身體」。所以，以運動會慶祝日木海軍節·意義良深·第二，運動會有人萬人參加，可以設是大衆化了。凡是紀念的事必須大衆化，才有價值，才能印入大衆的　際。</p>
<p>這次運動會懿備時間很坦，而能頣利舉行者，賴於能靑界先進如沈嗣良潘三省為家驥諸先生之贊助指道，運動員如王正林諸先生之熱烈參加，然心體育同業如張倞奎，費籌三諸先生之奔走接恰者·實為主因，同時，南洋醫院頣院長特派獲士到塲照料。我們以新聞聯合會會員一份子之食裕，在此特別向協力諸君，表示最大的敬謝之意。</p>

<h3>由補助敎職員生活說到澈底改善上海敎育</h3>
<p>— 黃舉</p>
<p>最近有補助敎職員生活費之舉，余熱思至再，茲就管見所及，略述如次，以便當局主其事者有所參考焉。</p>
<p>為敎職員者，其生活固其苦矣，然反觀學生家長之負擔，其苦處又何嘗較敎職員為輕哉！然則目前之敎育界，何以窮困一至於斯耶？余意其最大之理由當為學校缺乏有條理之收支計　也。</p>
<p>目今滬上諸校，其財政方面，決非負責者以外之人所可得知，一切帳目，大都含糊不淸，而為學至者，但知付出學費以獲得智識；為敎師者則以統日唇焦舌疲之代價換得少許之薪金；學校主事者則日謂其收入之不足而汲汲於增加學生之學費，月稱實支出之浩大而斷斷於就扣敎員之薪金。從中疲利之機會愈大，則弄堂學店之有無。此實邇年來滬上學生敎師之水準江河日下之主因也。</p>
<p>有志向學之士則因窮困而被擯於學門之外，眞才實學之敎師則因生活而不得不改就他集，所餘者唯一般混文　之花花公子，與夫從中漁利之校長輩耳！今乃用此數百十萬之補助金，而欲一振以往敎育界積習之頒氣，僅為治標之道而已。目下之計僅在乎當局能否實行下利諸點：</p>
<p>由本市敎育局，通令全市各公私立大·中·小學（其他各種專門學校暫且除外），令其速即將該校之財政狀况，校舍面積，能容人數，學生現有數，學雜費，敎職員名單，薪水，嚴歷，校長及校　諸有關人士等等詳細報告敎育當局，以便考查。</p>
<p>再由敎育局將全市劃分適當若干學區（第一區更須詳細劃分），選定若干地點較為適中，校舍相當寬大之學校為標準學校（其本為私立者改為公立），其餘各弄堂學校或規模較小者，悉予關閉，其生員可轉入各該區之公立學校。一切敎師設備等，除校長由敎育局愼重選派外，其餘均一仍其舊。如是則滬上學校俱皆一元化，而眉目漸淸秀矣！</p>
<p>目前本市學生敎員之品質水準均甚低劣，故須先將全市敎師，予以分科考驗，及格者則發給證　而照舊任用，其薪水必須有一定之數（成績優　者可　加）。</p>
<p>重新　定各學校之課程，課本，及格分數　，如是則一般　劣學生可用漸織法而淘汰焉，而不予被等以混文憑為事之學生有可乘之機。</p>
<p>財政方面，由敎育局直接管轄，各項收支力求標準化，減省不必需之冗費，能公開帳目更佳。以余之計算觀之，小學敎師至少亦可獲四五千元一個月也。</p>
<p>以上均為至　易之敎育治本方略，設敎育當局不以等閒觀之，則上海敎育復興，大有望焉。</p>

<p>「客人先生，醒了　？」</p>
<p>老板娘手拿着　帶和撣子，在走廊上站，不知道她在說些什麼，大概一定是問起來了麼——</p>
<p>不聲不轎，爬起來一看枕頭下的手數，　已過了九點多。同時，昨夜二時妝起來無論如何都寫不成的信，在飯掉上零亂地擺着。他把信紙都集攏起來，放到皮包裹，離開客廳而去洗臉。</p>
<p>（今天就是費一天工失，我也要把那對信寫成……）</p>
<p>他在心中道樣想着，便去吃早飯。因為睡眠不足，非常疲倦，所以飯後也無精神寫信</p>
<p>今天也是美麗的風平浪靜的秋天。地由於外面風光明媚的誘惑，而就有意出外散步去了。自從昨天上午來到旅館後，出外散步，這還是第一次。</p>
<p>「象打算散步去麼？象到紀念碑那面去看看吧！還有全景畫（Panorama）呢！」老板娘借給木嚴時這樣說的。</p>
<p>「是什麼紀念碑？」</p>
<p>隆夫有點驚奇地問。在這樣平凡而沉寂的海岸上有紀念碑之類的東西，的確是件奇怪的事。</p>
<p>「我不大淸楚，據說是白　利。」</p>
<p>「白魯利？」</p>
<p>「是，白魯利坐着輪船，曾到這個海邊的呀！」</p>
<p>「呵。是那個白魯利麼？」</p>
<p>「好像是那個白魯利。那末另外是否還有二個呌白藝利的人麼？」</p>
<p>「究竟怎樣，我不敢說。」隆夫覺得稍微興奮起來。</p>
<p>眞怪，白魯利到日本來，首先登陸是此處海岸，眞是出乎意外。先到浦賀來是記得的，然血就是這個地方，却是不知道的。</p>
<p>走到沙灘，四方一看，在公共汽車的路旁，發見了有石　　着的一個紀念碑。於是他就向那</p>
<p>（河田校長曾講過，白魯利來日的目的，和　藩與英國戰爭時代的英國艦隊隊相同……）</p>
<p>突然，他想起了這樣事情。隆夫這批人，與明治時代的靑年完全不同，並不曾認為白魯利是日本的開國元勳。他們認為白魯利是想佔領流球和小笠原島的。他們知道，剝去假面具，與襲擊薩摩的英國軍艦，是毫無二致的。</p>

        <h1>1944.05.28</h1>
<h3>Further Words on Mr. Chen Youren, by Yoshida Toyosuke</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren has passed away. It is said that one's life is settled at the coffin, and a person's true value is determined only after death. However, in these times when the Chinese National Revolution has not yet succeeded, to rashly comment on his political actions would be imprudent. Moreover, the role he played in the National Revolution is interpreted differently by various people. Nevertheless, those who had close contact with him rarely disagree on his character, especially his integrity, which is rarely seen among the Chinese. As for John Gunther, the author of "Inside Asia," although he briefly criticized Chen as a "professional politician," Gunther himself never met Chen. He merely echoed the words of the American journalist Sheean (see his book "Personal History"), who had conducted an interview with Chen Youren. Those who truly knew Chen knew he was a very sincere person, far removed from the concept of a "professional politician." One example suffices to show one aspect of Chen's touching character.</p>
<p>Before his death, Chen said to his wife: "My burial place is in the memory of the people. After my death, absolutely do not build a tomb. Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the Huangpu River or the sea!" He also firmly instructed that the funeral must be simple. In these times of hardship for the people, avoid causing others to spend money on my behalf at all costs. Refuse wreaths and the like entirely. As reported in the newspapers, Chen, who had served as Foreign Minister three times, had a very simple funeral. However, two friends who admired him gathered 100,000 yuan for funeral expenses (which Mrs. Chen later returned in full). The funeral committee contacted a funeral home to discuss the details. The funeral home agreed to handle it for 75,000 yuan. The next day, the funeral home suddenly changed its tune. The funeral committee thought the funeral home wanted more money because it was Mr. Chen Youren's funeral. Unexpectedly, the manager of the funeral home said, "Originally, we agreed on a total cost of 75,000 yuan, but when we heard it was Mr. Chen Youren's funeral, 25,000 yuan is enough. Because who among the Chinese does not know that Mr. Chen Youren was a great man who fought for the return of the British Concession in Hankou and brought pride to the Chinese nation? We want to do our best in his funeral arrangements, no matter what." The funeral committee was deeply moved by these words.</p>
<p>On May 22nd, Mr. Chen's farewell ceremony ended. The next day, when they went to the funeral home to pay the 25,000 yuan, the manager said again, "Wait, although we agreed on 25,000 yuan earlier, I felt that if I didn't say that, you might not even need us to handle the funeral, so I had to say it. In fact, we were prepared from the beginning not to accept any fees." The funeral committee was so moved by this deep and sincere kindness that tears welled up in their eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren's later years were not prominent, but even after his death, he still had such valuable sympathizers—not only that, but even the doctors who treated him did not charge a penny for medical expenses—this is good material to prove that Mr. Chen's personality influenced the Chinese national spirit. In China, there are even politicians who exploit the name of their parents' funerals to extort money. I think such people will never have such sympathizers when they die! (Translated by Yoshi)</p>
<h3>Mourning Mr. Chen Youren</h3>
<p>— Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren passed away at three o'clock in the morning on the 20th of this month. It so happened that I was in Beijing on official business, and I received a phone call from Shanghai that evening reporting this unfortunate news. I simply didn't believe it. I thought such a good person as he should not die. So, early on the morning of the 21st, I hastily called Shanghai to inquire, and the unfortunate news was indeed confirmed. After I finished the phone call, I received the various morning newspapers of Nanjing for that day, and when I looked at them, Mr. Chen Youren's death had indeed become news.</p>
<p>On this day, the 21st, I spent the whole day thinking of Mr. Chen Youren. The reasons I think of him are: he was a political theorist and thinker, and at the same time, he was a patriotic idealist and a loyal scholar. Although we were on different sides, in and out of the government, I considered him an invaluable and beneficial friend. After many students returned from studying abroad, they either became bureaucrats or merchants. However, Mr. Chen Youren always maintained his scholarly nature, disregarding his life and wealth, and always remembering to study world and national problems. Although I disagreed with some of his opinions, his enthusiasm and his thoughts could not help but inspire respect.</p>
<p>Chen Youren grew up abroad and did not understand Chinese characters, which was indeed his only regret. However, his patriotic ideas and plans for saving the country were far above those of ordinary literati who could research ancient texts, fill in lyrics, and write poetry. I believe that if he could have lived another five years, he would have been able to make even greater contributions to the country and society. Not to mention anything else, he was drafting a book on "Politics for All the People." If Heaven had granted him more years to complete that book, wouldn't that have been a great contribution?</p>
<p>I remember once giving him a book I had written before, and after he read it, he complimented me and said, "I am old, but you are still young. Since you have a solid foundation in learning, you should not forget to read books in your spare time from politics, so that you can make greater contributions to society in the future." When I heard this, I felt a little ashamed, but from then on, I worked even harder to read books. It is a pity that Mr. Chen has now passed away, and it will be really difficult to find a friend who can say such things in the future!</p>
<p>In short, Chen Youren's death is a great loss to our country and society.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of British Troops Trapped in Imphal Valley; Stored Military Supplies Almost Exhausted</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—Japanese troops advancing into India cut off the Kohima-Imphal highway near the dense forests on March 28th. On April 13th, they completely blocked the Silchar highway west of Bishenpur. Since then, the enemy's Fourth Corps in the Imphal Valley has only been able to rely on aerial resupply to prolong its survival, using stored supplies that were supposedly sufficient for several months to resist the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. After more than two months of fighting, the enemy's ammunition consumption has been enormous. The Japanese-Indian army has captured a large amount of materiel. The enemy, due to the onset of the rainy season, has had great difficulty with aerial resupply. Ammunition, fuel, food, and other supplies are now extremely insufficient, and the situation is quite urgent. The enemy is currently stockpiling military supplies near Moreh, Sibong, and Tonzang. The main force in Imphal is also accumulating several months' worth of supplies in the northwestern area, all of which are the enemy's countermeasures for the rainy season. However, the supplies at the Moreh, Sibong, and Tonzang front lines have all been captured or burned by the Japanese army. Only the supplies in the northwestern area of Imphal remain. In the past, resupply in this area was carried out via air transport from Silchar and Calcutta, using the Imphal and Pallel airfields. However, the three airfields in Pallel, north, central, and south, are now within range of Japanese heavy artillery. Furthermore, the enemy airfield at Kanglatongbi north of Imphal has also been destroyed and cannot be used. The airstrip north of Koirengei is waterlogged due to rain. Only the three airfields near Imphal, west, south, and north, can still be used, but due to the onset of the rainy season, they are not of much value. Now, tens of thousands of enemy troops in the Imphal Valley are trapped in a major predicament. The enemy's Fourth Corps is urgently seeking help from Mountbatten and has ordered the front lines to conserve ammunition. Food rations have also been halved since the end of April to extend the availability of supplies. With not much supplies stockpiled in the northwestern area of Imphal, and the Japanese army further tightening the encirclement, the enemy troops are in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>Air Battle Results in Three Days</p>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch)—The Japanese Air Force in Burma has been cooperating with ground forces in the Manipur area for several days, engaging in decisive battles with the enemy. On the 22nd, during an attack on Imphal, two enemy fighters came to intercept them over the Ukhru area, north of Imphal. They were shot down by Japanese aircraft. Elsewhere, two enemy P-51s were discovered near a certain location. The Japanese aircraft fired on them, causing them to catch fire and flee. Subsequently, sixteen enemy P-38s came to intercept them again, and a fierce air battle ensued. In this battle, three enemy aircraft were shot down. Also, four enemy P-51s came to attack a certain Japanese base, and one was shot down by the Japanese ground air defense unit. On the 24th, a squadron of Japanese fighters attacked Imphal and shot down two enemy aircraft that had come to attack Bishenpur. Another squadron of Japanese aircraft infiltrated the Imphal enemy airfield and strafed at low altitude, severely damaging an enemy B-25 that was about to take off. Furthermore, on the 25th, a Japanese fighter squadron engaged fifty enemy Spitfires patrolling over Imphal, shooting down five of them. On the same day, more than ten enemy P-51s attacked a certain Japanese base and one was shot down by the Japanese ground air defense unit.

<h3>Celebration of Japanese Navy Day Speech by Navy Minister</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Today marks the 39th Navy Day of our ally, Japan, and also the 39th anniversary of our East Asian people's first defense of East Asia, repelling the eastward expansion of racial forces. Thirty-nine years ago, it was the time of Japan's rise in the world. Under the command of Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese navy resolutely appointed Togo Heihachiro as commander-in-chief of the fleet. He knew that war between Japan and Russia was inevitable, and this decision was a complete preparation. On the night of February in the 27th year of Meiji [1894], like a bolt from the blue, the Japanese fleet swiftly attacked Lushun like a storm. The attack was sudden, and the Imperial Russian navy was caught off guard and unable to make proper defenses. In a short time, several of the Imperial Russian's main battleships and cruisers had been sunk, and many other large ships had been severely damaged, but the Imperial Russian's power in the Pacific had not been completely eliminated. At dawn on February 9th, the next day, the Japanese fleet launched a second fierce attack on Lushun. This time, the battle was more intense than the first day. The speed of the Japanese fleet's brave advance in battle can truly be described as</p>
<p>Earth-shattering</p>
<p>And causing ghosts and gods to weep. In terms of tactics, this was truly the first successful blitzkrieg. The control of the sea in East Asia belonged entirely to Japan, and the Japanese army was able to safely transport and land troops. The following year, on May 27th in the 38th year of Meiji [1905], the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet returned in force and engaged the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Sea of Japan. Under the command of the sacred general Marshal Togo, with his ingenious strategy and proper command, the Baltic Fleet was completely annihilated in two days, the 27th and 28th. From then on, Japan leaped to become the strongest naval power in the world, and this great historical achievement set a new record in history. To commemorate the indomitable and glorious Japanese Navy, Japan designated May 27th as Navy Day. This is the origin of Navy Day. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has repeatedly established special merits.</p>
<p>Examining the reasons for its victories, first is the strictness of its spiritual training. This spiritual strength is the traditional spirit of the Imperial Navy: loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, regarding death as returning home, with only the country and no self. Soldiers shed blood and sacrifice, while officers are selfless. The Japanese Navy's self-confidence in its human torpedoes is not an exaggeration. Second is the proficiency of its technical training. The Japanese Navy has established naval academies, naval military schools, mechanical schools, management schools, artillery schools, military medical schools, mine schools, communications schools, air-sea schools, and engineering schools to cultivate technical personnel. In-depth research is conducted, and specialties are divided to ensure balanced development and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, with twice the result for half the effort. Third is the abundance and improvement of the quality of ships. From the Russo-Japanese War to the Greater East Asia War, for thirty-six years, the construction of the Japanese Navy has been developing every day, with rapid progress, especially in the enrichment and improvement of quality. The extent to which this happened is beyond the imagination of the world. However, due to military secrets,</p>
<p>It still cannot be disclosed to this day. In fact, the tonnage and performance of the Japanese Navy today have surpassed those of Britain and the United States. From this, it can be seen that the success of the Japanese Navy is not accidental. It has a glorious history of forty years of struggle and forty years of diligent training. The whole country is united and regards the navy as the foundation, which is why it has achieved what it has today. Our country's navy has been in a state of slumber for fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Since the beginning of Chairman Wang's peace movement and the return of the capital, we have begun to actively build it up. At the same time, the naval authorities of our allies are assisting with the greatest effort. I, as the person responsible for the construction of the new Chinese navy, will certainly make outstanding achievements under the leadership of the leader. Our three one every shore need a navy, and the great task of joint defense of East Asia also requires China to have a navy. Recalling the difficulties in the construction of the navy in the early days of the founding of the country, our future is indeed bright, and our determination is even firmer. All construction should be modeled on our allies. Today, on the 39th Navy Day of our ally Japan, I offer my full respect and wish Japan's maritime transport prosperity and victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Easing Rice Control, Citizens of the Capital City Pay Great Attention Nanjing, 27th Central News Agency: Regarding the relaxation of rice control, measures have been formulated for the food supply of citizens in Nanjing and Shanghai, and a summary of temporary measures has been formulated to ensure an ample food supply for the citizens of both cities. Regarding the implementation details of the summary of temporary measures in the Nanjing area, such as the establishment of a passport issuing office, the determination of the price of rice to be purchased, and how to improve the distribution system, the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Beijing office of the Rice Control Association are currently discussing the matter in secrecy. It is expected to be officially announced in early next week. Regarding this matter, all citizens of the city are paying close attention to it, because this move not only concerns the future of the food supply for all citizens, but also has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will conduct detailed research on the implementation details to ensure that both urban and rural areas benefit from it. In particular, the clear announcement of the targets for purchase, the reasonable regulation of purchase prices, and the integrity and fairness of the personnel handling passport issuance and the actual purchase work are even more indispensable. Therefore, it is hoped that there will also be strict regulations on the punishment methods for the personnel handling these matters in the future, so as to sweep away the smoky atmosphere of the past and enable both production and consumption to benefit, in line with the ultimate goal of this relaxation of control by the authorities, as well as the aim of balancing prices, unblocking sources, and further stabilizing the people's livelihood and enhancing combat power.</p>

<h3>Special Issue on the Allied Japanese Navy Memorial Day, No. 8 Lessons of the Russo-Japanese War by Miyaji</h3>
<p>Tactical Lessons</p>
<p>The fact that the Japanese Navy achieved a great victory in the Russo-Japanese War not only led to Japan being listed as one of the six major naval powers internationally due to defeating a world-renowned strong country, but also proved that the Orientals, who had been despised as an inferior race, were by no means inferior to the Westerners. In awakening the consciousness of "if you do it, just do it," it had a great change not only in Japanese history, but also in world history. Thinking about this from the standpoint of the Navy, it is also a very important event.</p>
<p>Just as the Japanese Navy used the Sino-Japanese War as a testing ground for the value of faster cruisers, in the Russo-Japanese War, it also tested the power of the new types of warships that had been built after the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>In particular, the Battle of the Sea of Japan, because Japan fought against Russia's mixed fleet with a fleet with uniform speed and armament, this battle was real evidence of how much power there is when the strength of each ship in the fleet is equal. World naval experts had already advocated this theory before, but no one could have imagined that there would be such clear evidence.</p>
<p>When Admiral Rozhestvensky moored his fleet in Cam Ranh, French Indochina, on April 8, 1905, his fleet was still orderly, but for some reason, he waited there for more than a month for the arrival of the Third Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Nebogatov. Moreover, the Third Fleet that came to support was not very good, but was only a collection of old-fashioned warships. At unfavorable times, it would be a burden to the entire fleet. This was already known to everyone.</p>
<p>Indeed, leading this grand fleet, sailing 15,000 miles across the ocean to this point, is truly a commendable general, but his desire for more warships as a last hope can be said to be the characteristic of the Russian Navy that the Japanese naval officers did not have. Isn't this a manifestation of a characteristic of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak? Commander-in-Chief Togo also criticized:</p>
<p>"Admiral Rozhestvensky is indeed an extraordinary person. To command such a large fleet and travel the perilous route of 15,000 miles, his methods and hard work were extraordinary.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he did not have the will to go forward bravely and reach his destination early, but hesitated and lingered in vain."</p>
<p>In short, this truly teaches us that hesitation is most forbidden in wartime. At the same time, it also expounds the theory that fleets must never be formed by assembling unorganized types of warships.</p>
<p>Admiral Mahan of the United States criticized the great victory in the Sea of Japan, saying:</p>
<p>"The victory of the Japanese Navy was sheltered by concentrated tactics."</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Togo waiting with the entire fleet in the Tsushima Strait was also the reason for the Japanese Navy's victory. This teaches us that in future naval battles, "the full power of the entire fleet should be devoted to the battle." It can be seen that it is absolutely impossible to disperse combat power in wartime.</p>
<p>Lessons on Equipment</p>
<p>The Battle of the Sea of Japan not only gave us such teachings in tactics, but also caused great changes in the construction and armament of warships.</p>
<p>First, it proved how important the power of the main guns of battleships is in determining the outcome of naval battles. Although the importance of the main guns was already clear during the Sino-Japanese War, an example like the Battle of the Sea of Japan can be said to be unprecedented. Where the twelve-inch main guns of the battleships "Mikasa" and others roared, the elite of the Russian fleet successively sank to the bottom of the sea. It was the giant gun array of the main battleships on the first day that determined the success or failure of the Battle of the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>Second is the power of destroyers. From the first night to the morning of the second day, the night attack by destroyers and torpedo boats destroyed the foundation of the Russian fleet's resistance.</p>
<p>These two things proved that the main guns of battleships should be mounted as many as possible, and that torpedo boats, which act together with the fleet in the high seas, are too small, and that destroyers are more powerful in terms of reconnaissance, communication, and fast contact.</p>
<p>Third is the threat of submarines. When Russian General Makarov and his ship "Petropavlovsk" met their fate outside Lushun Harbor, the officers and soldiers of the Russian Lushun Fleet were panicked because of the Japanese submarines. Also, when the Japanese ship "Hatsuse" sank after hitting a mine southeast of Lao Tieshan on May 15, 1904, even among the calm Japanese naval personnel, no one was not shaken when witnessing the sinking of this world-renowned warship, and some people thought that this was the work of Russian submarines.</p>
<p>Also, among those who marveled at the unprecedented great victory in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, there were also claims that the victory of the Japanese fleet was due to the secret possession of submarines.</p>
<p>But at that time, submarines had not yet reached the stage of practical use. In 1904, the Japanese Navy first purchased five Holland-type submarines from the United States. Therefore, although Japan and Russia did not use submarines, it is a fact that this new type of weapon attracted the attention of experts from various countries at that time. And the invisible threat posed by this small warship was not small, and as a result, research on submarines became very popular.</p>
<p>Determination to Build a Navy</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Russo-Japanese War led the Japanese Navy to make a major decision since its establishment.</p>
<p>In 1871, when the Meiji Emperor inquired about the issue of enriching the naval military equipment in the Assembly Hall, the Hall replied: "Warships should be made by us, and it is not possible to buy them from others." After that, although Japan's shipbuilding technology greatly improved, it was still unable to build warships of the cruiser class.</p>
<p>Before the start of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government had ordered two 16,000-ton battleships, the "Kashima" and "Katori," from England. When the war broke out, both ships had been built, and in principle they should have been delivered to the Japanese Navy immediately, but the British side did not follow the pre-agreement for some reason.</p>
<p>According to the late Admiral Saito Makoto (who was then the Vice Minister of the Navy), when the "Hatsuse" sank, there was great panic in Japan. Regarding the issue of how to replenish it, even a meeting in the presence of the Meiji Emperor was convened. During the meeting, it was decided that the warships to be replenished must be built in Japan. However, the shipbuilding technical officers had no confidence in being able to build them with their own hands. However, because the decision was made at the meeting in the presence of the Emperor, there was no reason not to do it, so they had to bite the bullet and do it. The "Ikoma" and "Tsukuba" were built at the Kure Naval Arsenal. Like the warships built in the world at that time, they were equipped with four twelve-inch main guns, twelve six-inch secondary guns, and were armored cruisers with a speed of 20.5 knots. And the bow of the ship abandoned the corner of defense that warships had until then and changed it to a water-cutting type, which looked very light. And its speed surpassed that of battleships, and its armament was comparable to that of battleships, but its armor was thinner, so world naval experts were quite amazed to see it.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy had also surprised the world with the unique design of the Matsushima-class three-view warships, and this time it not only designed them, but also made them itself. In this way, the Japanese Navy became an independent navy that did not have to rely on foreign countries. The Japanese Navy not only became independent, but also caught up and developed day by day. (After this, only two Japanese ships were manufactured abroad: the battleship "Kongo" and the destroyer "Urakaze.")</p>
<p>What is expressed by comprehensively sending some teachings? The first is that battleships are equipped with many main guns, and the caliber of the secondary guns is similar to that of the main guns. For example, after the "Ikoma" and "Tsukuba," the battleship "Kurama" built at the Yokosuka Arsenal and the "Aki" built at the Kure Arsenal were all equipped with four twelve-inch main guns and twelve ten-inch secondary guns. These warships with similar calibers of main and secondary guns are called two-giant gun mixed-use ships. And because the secondary guns were arranged with six guns on each side of the left and right sides, it was possible to fight back with a total of ten giant guns, four main guns and six secondary guns, on either side of the string during combat.

<h3>A Day in the Life of a Navy Man</h3>
<p>Japanese children love to look at the sea and love to draw warships. This shows that from a young age, they already possess a strong sense of "Japan, the Maritime Nation." A first-grade elementary school student, when given paper and pen, can immediately draw a warship at will. However, what they draw are warships from the Meiji era, which, in the Showa era, appear too old-fashioned. Today's warships are not as simple as those drawn by elementary school students; they are the epitome of science, with everything mechanized and scientific. Furthermore, the spirit of the soldiers is even higher and more vigorous than in the past. The young men's warship life, where they treat death as returning home, is indeed full of vitality and vigor.</p>
<p>Their lives are disciplined. In the rigid routine of twenty-four hours, they are molded into great naval soldiers.</p>
<p>Morning Duties</p>
<p>Before dawn, the watchman on duty at the reporting clock reports to the officer of the watch:</p>
<p>"Officer of the watch—one quarter of an hour until everyone must get up."</p>
<p>This is at 5:45 AM. The officer of the watch then orders the messenger to notify the generator room, and electric lights are turned on throughout the ship. The deck officer emerges. The deck officer is a young ensign attached to the captain and executive officer, managing miscellaneous affairs within the ship.</p>
<p>The bell rings six times, and the messenger loudly announces through the speaking tube:</p>
<p>"Everyone get out of your hammocks." "Everyone stow your hammocks." "Everyone prepare for exercise."</p>
<p>In a moment, the crew is lined up on the deck, and naval exercises begin to the count of one, two, three, four. This lasts for about ten minutes. Following that, there is the order for lining up along both sides of the ship.</p>
<p>"Lining up along both sides" refers to the general term for sailors other than those on duty, mess attendants, and those with other specific duties. Most of the ship's work, aside from training and education, is done by those "lining up along both sides."</p>
<p>After the crew has lined up, the officer of the watch orders:</p>
<p>"Three men from each division, come forward."</p>
<p>One of these three men hoists the awning on the aft deck, while the other two wash the open decks. After thirty minutes, it is already bright, and the order is given to wash faces. The sailors take about two liters of fresh water to brush their teeth, rinse their mouths, and wash their faces. After washing their faces, the fragrant breakfast is brought up. In the harbor, a small steam launch chugs back, carrying the crew members who had gone ashore for rest after dinner yesterday.</p>
<p>After some greetings, the bugle call for "Prepare for meals" sounds, and breakfast begins. It takes about an hour from waking up to eating breakfast.</p>
<p>After breakfast, there is a thirty-minute break, followed by cleaning the living decks.</p>
<p>There are two types of decks on a warship. One is the open deck, commonly called the upper deck. Below that, the deck where the crew's quarters are located is called the living deck.</p>
<p>After cleaning the decks, the crew prepares the various weapons that are the life of the warship.</p>
<p>At 7:45 AM, "Guard detail, prepare."</p>
<p>At 7:55 AM, the sailor and non-commissioned officer in charge of the warship flag box prepare to raise the flag at the flagstaff on the stern. The band is at the front, and the guard detail is at the rear, lining up towards the stern. The captain and executive officer also come out.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM precisely, the bugle call for "Attention" sounds. Everyone stops what they are doing and stands at attention, facing the stern. The bandmaster raises his baton, the signalman blows the bugle, and at the same time, the officer of the watch orders:</p>
<p>"Raise the flag!"</p>
<p>The rifle squad raises their rifles, and the band plays the national anthem. Everyone raises their hands and pays attention as the warship flag slowly rises, fluttering in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>The daily schedule for the mornings and afternoons varies each day and differs depending on the mission of each ship. Generally, class time is from morning until 11:30 AM, and in the afternoon, from 1:15 PM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>11:45 AM is lunchtime, and the five minutes before class resumes at 1:30 PM is break time.</p>
<p>After the afternoon classes end, dinner is at 4:15 PM. In the summer, the sun is still shining brightly in the western sky at that time. Won't everyone get sick from being cooped up until tomorrow morning? But there's no need to worry. Once the sun sets, everyone happily goes ashore for leisure.</p>
<p>Leisure Time</p>
<p>At 4:45 PM, groups of three or five soldiers, dressed in their neat uniforms and polished shoes, gather on the aft deck. These are the soldiers permitted to go ashore for leisure. They are transported by a launch and must return to the ship before breakfast the next morning. They rotate in shifts: non-commissioned officers every other day, petty officers and leading seamen every four days, and ordinary seamen every six days. This is called "bathing leave," meaning going ashore to wash away the grime of the sea.</p>
<p>After the crew members go ashore, those remaining practice various subjects, such as semaphore, calisthenics, judo, kendo, and bayonet drill. As the sun is about to set, the order is given to lower the flag. The ceremony is as solemn and important as the morning flag-raising. At the same time, lights are turned on throughout the ship.</p>
<p>The time after this is the most leisurely of the day. Everyone goes to the canteen to chat, drink wine, and buy daily necessities such as soap, stationery, and toothpaste.</p>
<p>At 7:45 PM, hammocks are slung, and preparations are made for bed. By 8:00 PM, the final cleaning of the decks is done. At 8:30 PM, the inspection bugle call echoes through every corner of the ship. The deck officer, accompanied by the executive officer, inspects each part of the ship. At this time, the soldiers are dreaming of their hometowns under their snow-white towel blankets.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the day's schedule is considered finished after inspection. However, the entire warship is never completely at ease. The officer of the watch, the assistant officer of the watch, the guard detail, the signalmen, the radiomen, and the engineers, all under the command of the captain, take turns guarding their posts. In the event of a sudden emergency during the night, everyone can wake up and line up on deck within two or three minutes.</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM, all communication between the naval port, warships, and the land is cut off. At 11:00 PM, the lights inside the ship are turned off, leaving only small lights on the foredeck and at the gangway. After that, it is the quiet night of the naval port, with only the sound of the boots of the watchmen patrolling the ship. Around 3:00 AM, the engineers and stewards on duty get up to prepare breakfast for the entire crew.</p>
<p>From the captain to the ordinary seaman, everyone spends twenty-four hours a day under strict military discipline, integrated into a large family-like atmosphere, preparing for tomorrow's battle.</p>

Rear Admiral Kondo delivered a speech: "The Shanghai News Association is celebrating the 39th Naval Anniversary of Japan by holding this grand sports meet, for which the Navy is deeply grateful. I am honored to be invited to attend and speak a few words at this opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine years ago, on this day of this month, at this same hour of 2:00 PM, the Japanese Combined Fleet engaged and annihilated the [Russian] fleet in the Tsushima Strait. Today, we celebrate this historical anniversary. The Shanghai News Association's decision to hold this sports meet is of profound significance.</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: 'A sound mind dwells in a sound body.' The peoples of Greater Asia, in order to build Greater East Asia, must first cultivate sound bodies, which is of utmost importance and goes without saying. At this moment when the peoples of Greater Asia are rising up and the Greater East Asia War is being waged, the holding of this event by the Association is deeply meaningful. I wholeheartedly wish it success. May all the athletes fully demonstrate the spirit of good sportsmanship." The winners and results of the various track and field exhibition matches are as follows: 100 meters: Yu Liming, 11.7 seconds; 200 meters: Yu Liming, 24.4 seconds; 400 meters: Qiu Zhenfu, 55.6 seconds; 800 meters: Tan Zhishao, 2 minutes 11.2 seconds; 1500 meters: Wang Zhenglin, 4 minutes 26.1 seconds; 10,000 meters: Pan Ziao, 33 minutes 36 seconds; Shot put: Guan Hongda, 12.77 meters; Long jump: Deng Dekuan, 6.23 meters; Discus throw: Wang Jingwu, 28.02 meters; Javelin throw: Wang Xuewu, 42.2 meters; High jump: Li Zhenzhong, 1.66 meters; 2000-meter cycling sprint: Zhang Xingqun, 4 minutes 55 seconds; 400-meter relay: Three Provinces Team, 48.9 seconds; 1600-meter relay: Yucai Team, 4 minutes 25 seconds.</p>

The First Police Bureau Band played music, and the crowd exceeded ten thousand, filling the stadium and creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>President Yuan Shu's Speech</p>
<p>The games began with an opening address by President Yuan of the Xin Zhongguo Bao (New China Daily), who stated: "Today is the 39th Naval Anniversary of the allied Japan, and the Shanghai News Association is holding a soccer exhibition match in celebration. Thirty-nine years ago today, the allied navy decisively defeated the Russian fleet, laying the foundation for the Greater East Asia naval strength. Today, the allied navy controls the Pacific and Indian Oceans, standing on the forefront of military power. We Chinese people are constantly assisting in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, striving for ultimate victory."</p>
<p>Minister Matsumoto's Opening Kick</p>
<p>Information Director Matsumoto, representing Minister Usami, performed the opening kick, and the strong athletes began their competition. Lianyi initially launched fierce attacks, but the Three Provinces team was not to be outdone, resolutely counterattacking. Luo Yao desperately tried to reclaim lost ground, and Zhou Wenkui scored again. Lianyi reclaimed a goal, tying the score at two to two. The Three Provinces team, with the help of a well-placed corner kick, scored again, making the score three to two in the first half. After the break, the teams launched another attack, and Lianyi, with a powerful kick, scored two consecutive goals within twenty minutes, making the score four to three, turning defeat into victory. The players of the Three Provinces team desperately counterattacked, but to no avail. By the thirty-fifth minute, Lianyi scored another goal, resulting in a final score of five to three, with Lianyi victorious. Although the Three Provinces team has traditionally enjoyed a friendly relationship with the Lianyi team, this defeat can be said to have turned loss into honor. Jin Xiongzhi, the chairman, delivered the closing remarks, expressing gratitude to the attendees, players, and staff. Subsequently, Wen Kaiting presented awards, with each team receiving a large silver cup from the association as a memento. The games concluded amidst music and enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Basketball, Volleyball, and Table Tennis Matches</p>
<p>Beginning at 5:00 PM, volleyball, basketball, and table tennis exhibition matches were held at the West YMCA Stadium, with attendees including Sakurazumi, Shen Juanliang, Zhao Zhengping, and other officials from both allied nations, as well as guests and crowds from various sectors, gathering together in a warm and lively atmosphere, creating an unprecedented spectacle. For a time, outside the West YMCA gate, there were still hundreds of fans, as the stadium was already packed.

During the match, the Zhongbei team performed a basketball exhibition, ending with a score of thirty-six to thirty-eight, with Zhongbei victorious.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp Actively Under Preparation, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Invite Various Circles Today</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the economic center of the country, but the number of vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and ruffians is also the highest in the country. This damages the city's appearance, obstructs public order, and especially disrupts the activities of travelers, merchants, and public welfare. The financial losses suffered by the honest citizens and merchants of this city are quite substantial. Over time, the annual financial losses are even more alarming. All sectors of the city earnestly hope that the authorities will adopt appropriate measures to alleviate the suffering of good people, improve the city's appearance, and enhance public security. It is reported that Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Mayor Chen of this city, acceding to the requests of various parties, have jointly established the "Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp" to house vagrants, beggars, hooligans, and ruffians in the city. The camp site is to be located outside the urban area, to facilitate education and reform, as well as to force them to work, mainly in agricultural labor, to assist in production. Moreover, if the vagrants and beggars in the city can be centrally housed, the city's appearance can be improved, public security can be enhanced, and public welfare can be promoted, truly achieving several benefits in one fell swoop, demonstrating great effort. A meeting has been held to discuss this matter, and personnel have been dispatched to actively prepare for a tea party to be held on the 28th, inviting leaders and celebrities from various circles in the city. The time is set for 3:00 PM, and the location is the Japan-China Club on Xianyang Road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Donate Army and Navy Aircraft, Joint Naming Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th) was Japanese Naval Memorial Day. The 20 army and navy aircraft donated by the 100,000 Japanese residents were jointly named at 10 a.m. in Hongkou Park in this city. First, the national anthem was sung together, followed by a recitation of scriptures, a congratulatory prayer, and a naming ceremony. Young girls also presented flowers to the air force personnel. Finally, guests represented by Consul Yano Ki led three cheers of "Banzai," and the ceremony ended around 11 a.m.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Schedules Election of Directors and Supervisors Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene its annual general meeting of member representatives on the 26th of next month to elect directors and supervisors. The association has 21 directors and 12 supervisors, all of whom are elected from among the member representatives by the general meeting. All directors serve in honorary positions. It is reported that relevant government agencies such as the Commerce and Trade Association and the Municipal Economic Bureau will send personnel to attend and oversee the election to ensure fairness. Although all members are eligible to serve as directors and supervisors, those with any of the following circumstances are ineligible for election: Those deprived of public rights. Those who have engaged in acts against the peace and nation-building policy and have been proven to have done so. Those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been reinstated. Those who are engaged in improper occupations. Those who are mentally ill. Those who are incompetent. Those who smoke opium or other substitutes.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Company Further Reduces Limits, New Measures Effective May 21</h3>
<p>The French Concession Tramway and Electricity Company of this city has issued a notice to all users regarding restrictions on water and electricity usage. The company will implement measures to restrict the initial usage, and the company may take disconnection measures without prior notice. All users are requested to pay attention to the following points: Until May 21, the calculation method for limiting the usage of general users is based on 65% of their respective reference usage. However, for hotels, restaurants, barbershops, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, etc., the percentage is 55%. From May 21, unless new regulations are announced, the calculation method for limiting the usage of general users will be changed to 50% of their respective reference usage. For hotels, restaurants, barbershops, theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, etc., it will be changed to 40%. The above-mentioned reference usage is based on the highest daily usage recorded in August, September, and October of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). It is hoped that all users will pay attention to conserving electricity for air-conditioning equipment, such as refrigerators and cold rooms, to avoid exceeding the limits. Users can adjust the operation of their air-conditioning equipment each month to avoid exceeding the limits.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Meaningful Commemoration</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 39th Naval Anniversary of the allied Japan. The Shanghai News Association initiated a sports meet to celebrate. The track and field competition at the Racecourse, the soccer match at the Aikoku (Patriotic) Stadium, and the basketball, volleyball, and table tennis matches at the West YMCA attracted more than ten thousand spectators, creating a grand and enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>We feel that commemorating Japanese Naval Anniversary with a sports meet has two meanings: First, it promotes sports through athletic competition, cultivates physical fitness through promoting sports, and encourages the public to pay attention to physical health through sports activities. On the one hand, every member of the Japanese Navy, from officers to soldiers, has a strong physique, which is the result of emphasizing physical training. As Rear Admiral Kondo said in his speech: "A sound spirit dwells in a sound body." Therefore, celebrating Japanese Naval Anniversary with a sports meet is of profound significance. Second, a sports meet with ten thousand participants can be said to be popularized. Any commemorative event must be popularized to have value and to be imprinted in the public's mind.</p>
<p>The time for this sports meet was very short, but it was able to be held smoothly thanks to the support and guidance of progressive figures from the sports world such as Shen Siliang, Pan Sansheng, and Jia Ji, the enthusiastic participation of athletes such as Wang Zhenglin, and the efforts of physical education colleagues such as Zhang Jingkui and Fei Chousan in coordinating the event. At the same time, President [ ] of Nanyang Hospital specially dispatched doctors to provide on-site care. As a member of the News Association, we would like to express our greatest gratitude to all those who have helped.</p>

<h3>From Subsidizing Teachers' Living Expenses to Thoroughly Improving Shanghai Education</h3>
<p>— Huang Ju</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a move to subsidize teachers' living expenses. After careful consideration, I will briefly outline my humble opinions below for the reference of those in charge.</p>
<p>The lives of teachers are indeed difficult, but looking back at the burden on students' parents, their hardships are no lighter than those of teachers. So why is the education sector so impoverished today? I believe the biggest reason is the lack of a systematic income and expenditure accounting system in schools.</p>
<p>Currently, in Shanghai schools, financial matters are only known to those in charge. All accounts are mostly vague and unclear. Students only know to pay tuition to acquire knowledge; teachers exchange their exhausting efforts for meager salaries; school administrators constantly complain about insufficient income and eagerly increase student fees, while also frequently deducting teachers' salaries due to large expenditures. The greater the opportunity for profit, the more likely there will be alleyway schools. This is the main reason for the declining standards of students and teachers in Shanghai in recent years.</p>
<p>Ambitious scholars are excluded from education due to poverty, and teachers with real talent and learning are forced to change careers due to livelihood issues. What remains are generally frivolous playboys who muddle through and school administrators who profit from it all! Now, using these several hundred thousand yuan in subsidies to revive the long-standing bad habits of the education sector is merely a superficial solution. The current plan should focus on whether the authorities can implement the following points:</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau should issue a notice to all public and private universities, middle schools, and primary schools (excluding other specialized schools for now) in the city, ordering them to promptly report detailed information to the education authorities about the school's financial situation, school building area, capacity, current number of students, tuition and fees, list of teachers, salaries, qualifications, principals, and other relevant personnel for investigation.</p>
<p>Then, the Education Bureau should divide the city into several appropriate school districts (the first district should be further divided in detail), select schools with relatively central locations and sufficiently large buildings as standard schools (private schools should be converted to public ones), and close the remaining alleyway schools or smaller-scale schools. Their students can transfer to the public schools in their respective districts. All teachers and equipment should remain the same, except for the principal, who should be carefully selected and appointed by the Education Bureau. In this way, Shanghai schools will be unified, and things will gradually become clearer!</p>
<p>Currently, the quality and standards of students and teachers in the city are very low, so all teachers must first be tested by subject. Those who pass will be issued certificates and retained in their original positions. Their salaries must be fixed (those with excellent performance can be increased).</p>
<p>Re-determine the curriculum, textbooks, and passing scores for each school. In this way, generally inferior students can be gradually eliminated, and students who only want to obtain diplomas will not have the opportunity to take advantage of the system.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the Education Bureau should directly manage it. Strive to standardize all income and expenditures, reduce unnecessary waste, and preferably make the accounts public. According to my calculations, primary school teachers can earn at least four to five thousand yuan a month.</p>
<p>The above are all easy-to-implement fundamental strategies for education management. If the education authorities do not treat them lightly, then the revival of Shanghai education is greatly promising.</p>

<h3>Request to the Health Authorities to Remove Street Garbage</h3>
<p>Garbage is visible everywhere on the streets in the first district. As the weather gets warmer, it is particularly harmful to hygiene. Recently, there have been large garbage piles accumulating in two locations on Kangding Road, Taixing Road, and the eastern section of West Jiangning Road, with a foul odor, causing suffering to residents and pedestrians. The garbage in An'nan Road and An'nan Lane has not been collected for three weeks. We urgently urge the relevant authorities to actively clear it to emphasize public health and prevent epidemics.

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Takeo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Letter to My Sister (5)</p>
<p>In the vaguely illuminated room, he should have woven (织了=woken) up. The morning sun glared angrily.</p>
<p>"Mr. Guest, are you awake?"</p>
<p>The landlady stood in the hallway with a duster and a cloth in her hand, not knowing what she was saying. Perhaps she was asking if he was up.</p>
<p>Without a sound, he climbed up and checked the time under his pillow. It was already past nine o'clock. At the same time, the letter he had been trying to write since two o'clock last night, but couldn't, was scattered on the table. He gathered the letters and put them in his leather bag, leaving the guest room to wash his face.</p>
<p>(Even if it costs me a day's work, I will finish that letter...)</p>
<p>He thought to himself and went to have breakfast. Because of lack of sleep, he was very tired, so he didn't feel like writing after breakfast.</p>
<p>Today was also a beautiful, calm autumn day. Due to the temptation of the beautiful scenery outside, he decided to go for a walk. This was his first walk since arriving at the hotel yesterday morning.</p>
<p>"Are you planning to go for a walk? Why don't you go see the monument on that side! And there's a panorama!" The landlady said to Takeo.</p>
<p>"What monument is it?"</p>
<p>Takeo asked with some surprise. It was indeed strange to have a monument of some kind on such an ordinary and quiet coast.</p>
<p>"I'm not very clear, but it is said to be that of Perry."</p>
<p>"Perry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Perry came to this coast on a ship!"</p>
<p>"Ah, is it that Perry?"</p>
<p>"It seems to be that Perry. Otherwise, is there another person called Perry?"</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly," Takeo felt a little excited.</p>
<p>It was strange that Perry came to Japan and first landed on this coast. It was really unexpected. He remembered that he first came to Uraga, but he didn't know it was this place.</p>
<p>Walking to the beach, he looked around and found a monument with stone steps next to the bus road. So he headed towards it.</p>
<p>(Principal Kawada once said that Perry's purpose in coming to Japan was the same as that of the British fleet during the Satsuma Domain's war with Britain...)</p>
<p>Suddenly, he thought of this. Takeo and his peers were completely different from the youth of the Meiji era and did not consider Perry to be a pioneer of Japan's opening to the world. They believed that Perry wanted to occupy Ryukyu and the Ogasawara Islands. They knew that, stripped of the mask, he was no different from the British warships that attacked Satsuma.</p>
