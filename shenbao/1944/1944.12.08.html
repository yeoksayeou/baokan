<h3>大東亞戰爭勝利關鍵端在後方努力生產　三週紀念日小磯首相廣播演說</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　當此決定太平洋決戰將來之雷伊泰決戰方酣之時，又適爲意義深長之大詔奉戴日三週年紀念日，日小磯首相特於是日上午六時半捧　詔書後，即發表廣播演說，說明粉碎敵人奪回菲律賓野心之戰機正在成熟，戰勝之關鍵，端繫於後方生產陣補給戰事，要求一億同胞奮起，舉體夭皇陛下之聖意，於十二分至誠，作戰勝之信念，茲誌廣播詞如决：</p>
<p>東亞建設</p>
<p>三年前之十二月八日，吾人接獲日軍大規模空襲珍珠灣之消息時，更曾戴奉對英美宣戰之詔勅，當此瞬息之間，日本一億同胞精神之挺奮，實難以言語形容。今日此種感動，又復活於吾等之胸際，使吾人更肅然把握完遂聖戰之決心。吾人回顧三年以來，日本戰體展開偉大光輝之途徑，益感太東亞戰爭意義之宏大無限。時至今日，在東亞方面新興之菲律賓·緬甸，已打破過去英美之壓制支配，高揭光榮獨立旗幟。其次，東印度各島民衆，亦更充滿光明之希望，以期於最近完成獨立，至於英美在東亞之租辦，如上海·天津等地，亦已撤清，而成爲蔑視東亞人象徵之治外法權，亦被一掃而淸，具有偉大歷史與傳統光輝之中華民國，業已步入自主獨立之坦途，泰國於恢復東亞本來面目後，即已將過云英美之濃厚色彩一掃而淸，由是，新的道義世界，今日在東亞已益進入建設之途，崇高之東洋精神與文化，亦已計日復興，善良之東洋民族，爲暗存稱覇東洋野心之英美之甘言與虛偽所乘，遂致精神財產乃至民族于獨立均被掠奪，爲時已久，大東亞戰爭即爲使此等東洋民族認淸眞正敵人之姿態，同時在喚醒東亞民族奮起精神，以克服艱困之運命，並在使今日東亞民族合作，對抗强力之侵略者。</p>
<p>敵人野望</p>
<p>吾人今日已決不爲英美之一切甘言所蓋，在過去三年間之戰爭中，英美已費去國帑數千萬萬元，犧牲數百萬人民之生命，然而彼等由於此次戰爭究有何所得，簡直彼等在其大義名分上已頗欠明瞭，惟彼等欠缺大義名分實屬當然，因彼等實無任何戰爭理由，彼等不過係藉龐大之國土及無盡藏之資源，以謀將勢力伸展於東西兩洋，使其國防上之安全藉此得以保障而已。然彼等之所以不能不戰之原因，對於此一疑問之答覆，實極其簡單，換言之，彼等除抱着制覇世界野心之外，實無任何目的，但彼等爲　蔽其醜惡之野心，亦曾作一種種虛偽之說明，彼等此種說明，甚至彼等自身國民，亦無法理解，惟彼等爲奮起國民之敵愾，必須正大事宣傳謂，日本爲侵略者或挑戰者，而大東亞戰爭之所以發生原因，顯係由於彼等此種野心所致。彼等爲達成其野心，乃肆行其經濟上，武力上之挑戰，迫使日本處於非應戰惟有滅亡之立塲，因之日本爲自存自衛，遂不得不噘起以賭存亡，至於彼等是否係一侵略國，此祇憑神與狡怪之裁斷，將可明瞭，蓋美國實爲世界第一事宣傳國，時常發揮其可驚之宣傳力，指鹿爲馬，彼等除以天文學數誇大宣傳其所予日軍之損害外，另一方面，對於自身所受損失，則不輕發表，由此，美國完遂爲戰勝之麻藥，痳痺全不認識戰敗之歸趨。同時，對自身爲羅斯福野心而犧牲，而付矛之代價，更不自覺，美國不斷强迫國民從事戰爭，最近更屢决派空軍空襲日本本土，尤其對於東京，更濫施轟炸，充分發揮其非人道行爲，謀短期內從事決戰。</p>
<p>生產補給</p>
<p>然而日本國民爲保護國體，已具有戰至最後一人，誓不屈服及必勝之信念，故認濫施轟炸，可使日人戰慄，實屬可笑，以吾人立塲而觀，敵人每一顆炸彈實不足以阻止吾人不屈不撓之努力，吾人之任務，尤其敵人之濫炸，不僅使無辜之人命遭受犧牲，抑且使神社及崇高歷史紀念物破壞，處此熊形下，日本國民必將奮起，以熟血對美國實行報復行爲，吾人每視察因被濫炸而犧牲之情形，即愈增其憤激，提高其勇鬥之精神·同時，日制空陣亦斷不容敵之跳梁，彼曾屢次來襲，亦惟有徒勞往返。其次，雙方以雷伊泰島爲中心之決戰塲，連日亦實行轟炸，迭獲可驚之戰果，吾人每回顧此種戰果，必增其必勝之信念，惟有雷伊泰之決戰，才能決定太平洋決戰之將來，吾人自應將侵入之敵人驅出海岸，今足以粉碎敵人夢想，菲律賓野心之戰機正在成熟，吾等後方國民爲呼應前綫將兵之決死敢鬥，自應不斷生產，盡量協助將兵從事作戰，蓋戰勝之關鍵，端在乎吾等後方之生　補給戰也。</p>
<p>歐洲戰局</p>
<p>反顧歐洲戰局，於本年八九兩月，敵國自不待言，即歐洲一部中立國，亦認德國即將敗北，或變更其態度，或論戰後計劃，世人之心均以爲歐洲將發生一大變化，盟邦德國處此難局，希特勒統率下國民，團結益增强，於敵人空襲之下，仍力謀增强生產，武裝國民，今於國境防禦敵大軍，已使戰綫陷於膠着狀態。一方英美佔領下之南部義大利，法蘭西，比利時諸國國民，迫於窮乏饑俄，在社會上與政治上之不安現象，已時刻增大，且波蘭，巴爾幹等國際情勢至極複雜，敵英美之苦惱焦慮；亦爲深刻，今日決難預斷德國何時崩潰，由於德國舉國一致努力，已使敵方所作之希望觀測正得其反。歐洲諸情勢，較之本年九月間可謂顯著，向軸心方而好轉，吾人藉此機會，向盟邦德國國民諸君之堅固團結與其拼鬥精神，深表敬意，並盼今後亦於希特勒總統統率之下，奮勇作戰，誓死擊滅英美，貫澈所期待之目的。</p>
<h3>十億　民族一致奮起完成保衛東亞偉業　大東亞戰三周年陳代主席談話</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　今（八日）日爲大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日，陳代主席特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭勃發至今，已經三年。回顧旣往，戰局日向有利的發展，東亞民族日趨堅强的團結，中日兩國日增緊密的協力。適於此時汪主席未克戰爭的完遂，遽棄我人而長逝，瞻望前途，益感責任之重大。</p>
<p>戰爭發生之前，盟邦日本即申明此戰目的，在爭取東亞民族之共同生存，而中日事變，亦由此一變而爲保衛東亞的戰爭。日本更屢曾聲明，在大陸作戰，幷非與中國爲敵，乃在驅逐英美，其意義至爲光明正大。以是之故，用須喚起全東亞人，同仇敵愾之精神。三年以來，義師所指，無堅不摧，蓋在於此。最近海陸兩方作戰，迭獲赫赫戰果，尤非偶然，斯實東亞民族所同深感奮而敬佩者。</p>
<p>去年一月，國民政府本於同生共死之決心，毅然參戰，自斯以來，積極從事參戰體制之確立，凡所以協力戰爭者，無不惟力是視。注主席雖已棄吾人而長逝，而其救中國保東亞之偉大精神，始終領導吾人繼續奮鬥，今後仍當一木旣定方針，策厲全國軍民，不避任何艱苦，奮力前進，以爭取最後之勝利，以慰汪主席在天之靈。</p>
<p>現在戰爭已進入決戰階段，英美爲挽救共旣往之頹勢，自必死力掙扎，未來戰爭之劇烈，固在意料之中。然以盟邦陸海空軍雄厚之賣力，與優越之形勢，益以舉國上下必勝之信念，再益以全東亞民族同生共死之決心，必能確保勝利，可以斷言。</p>
<p>中國現爲戰友之一，即應盡其同盟參戰之義務，當務之急，以鞏固後方，供應前方，粉碎敵人殘餘勢力，使之放棄其再侵　東亞之野心爲第一要着。促進和平統一，挽救重慶，使之擺脫英美的覊絆，還我本來面目爲又一要着。本人深信全國同胞，必能認識時局之嚴重，相與奮起，共歷艱鉅。同時潔信東亞十億民族，必能團結一致，做成保衛東亞的銅牆鐵壁，進而創立共存共榮的新天地。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭三週年</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭到今天已經三週年了。</p>
<p>三年以來，可以使得我們興奮的地方自然很多，不過，應該反省之處，似也不少；同時，在興奮反省之餘，我們還需多多惕勵，以期澈底完成大東亞戰爭的使命。</p>
<p>興奮的是什麼呢？首先即是軍事的勝利。在太平洋上，敵美迭受巨創，目前侵菲的敵美海空軍，在盟邦神勇的陸海空部隊迎擊之下，也已成了强弩之末。印緬國境的敵英軍，則始終受着盟軍的克制。至在中國大陸，盟軍節節進展，現在突人貴州省境，重慶的處境益竊。政治方面，於大東亞共同宣言及中日同盟條約之下，大東亞各國的團結，現日臻鞏固，而緬甸菲律賓等，則已完成獨立，馬來等地也已奠定了自治基礎，各方面都進步得很快。至於生產建設，以飛機生產爲中心的盟邦生產力增大之速，已震驚世界，其他各地，尤其南方區域的經濟建設，也莫不有飛躍的發展。大東亞旣有如此龐大的力量，擊滅英美，自具有充分把握。但前面已經指出過，我們於興奮之餘，還應反省。無可諱言的，作爲大東亞重要一員的中國，應該反省的地方，實特別較多。我們在戰爭中究竟盡過多少力量呢？前年大東亞戰爭一週年之時，本報社評曾指出，我們應該積極發揮全國人民的力量以與日本協力，第一是改善全國政治，集中人民的力量，第二是喚醒重慶依賴英美的迷夢。爲東亞民族總解放而共同與友邦協力，澈底肅淸英美的勢力。又於去年二週年之時，我們復指出協力大東亞戰爭，允須光使自己國家健全，第一，人民應有參與政治的權利，俾人民與政府打成一片，第二，人民安定，樂爲國用，第三，經濟發達，資源盡量開發利用。</p>
<p>三年間我們在人力上和資源上貢獻於大東亞戰爭者，雖也不在少數，然而仔細反省一下，實在還不曾盡足力量。人力顯然還沒有充分發揮，資源顯然還沒有充分利用。目前民生的艱困，可以說已到頂點，民生迄未安定，試問如何能够集中國民力量及喚醒重慶治下的人民呢？又如何能够使經濟資源處量開發？</p>
<p>我們覺得民生不能安定，人力未充分發揮，資源未充分利用的原因，政治之未盡合乎理想實佔極大部份。三年來我國政治不論在機構上和人事上，可以率直地說，都進步得太慢。同時，關於人事措施的不够完滿，在政府有不勝任甚至　職分子；在野則有不少有爲之士，一方面固未得當局盡量延用而埋沒。一方面也有自以爲「明哲保身」而不願獻身國家，這也是健全政治的一大障礙。</p>
<p>戰爭愈接近最後勝利的階段，也愈見艱苦，我們應該加緊動員人材資材，以與盟邦協力。希望當局從速改善政事，任用賢能，從速安定民生，庶幾人民和政府眞正打成一片，完成大東亞戰爭澈底勝利，民族獨立的偉大使命。</p>
<h3>團結十億民族　完遂戰爭勝利　谷大使昨發表談話</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　際茲大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日，日駐華谷大使特於七日發表談話如决：</p>
<p>自我國對美英兩國頒佈宜戰大詔以還，業歷三周年。對於在御稜威之下，於數千里之廣大戰域，在陸海空三方面挺身敢鬥，忠勇無比之我陸海軍將士，曁戰歿之英靈，謹表衷心之感謝。茲回顧過去三年間，爲完成大東亞戰爭之目的，實際具體加以實現之大東亞各民族，或宣言互相提携，自主獨立，或奮然而起，向敵美宜戰，與帝國一同向擊滅英美，完成大東亞戰爭，完成大東亞建設偉業之前途邁進。</p>
<p>其中如中華民國在故汪主席領導之下，內則基於和平建國之精神，猛力推進各項施策，藉期完成中國之自主獨立，同時對外則與盟邦，尤其與日本之問，撤廢不平等條約，並締結中日同盟條約等，使兩國之關係得以劃時期之進展，共向繫減共同之敵邁進。但美英兩國目前强行不逞之反攻，大東亞戰爭現已突入大東亞興亡之朮大決戰階段。尤其在中國，美英兩國爲謀完成其利已之野心，將使中國變成戰墟，且使中國民衆爲美機盲炸之犧牲品。反之，我方軍事行動之目的，曾闡明究全在於粉碎敵美英之野心，中國民衆固爲吾之友，苟若排除與美英協力者，縱使渝方之軍隊，亦非吾人之敵。如此貫澈道義之日軍將士，與後方之國民，嚴正存在，若獲得十億民族爲完成大東亞戰爭，而加以强有力之支援，則大東亞戰爭之最後勝利，確信必在於吾人云。</p>
<h3>美艦隊及空母　蒙潰滅打撃</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　台灣空戰及菲律賓海戰後，美艦隊已受重創，旋日軍更有神風特別攻擊隊之連襲，結果美艦隊及航空母艦羣已蒙潰滅打擊，煨近遝動已趨消極。關於美國航空母艦之殘存勢力，栗原報道部長對記者談稱：敵軍殘存空母之現狀，其數字雖不得判斷，此次台灣空戰前，敵於太平洋方面有制式空母十三四艘，一萬噸改裝之空母九艘，其他商船改造空母五十艘，企岡一舉進攻台灣，菲律賓，此外幷有英國航空母艦羣若干，巡迥於太平洋上，自台灣空戰以來至今，已予敵艦以相當損失，殘存兵力約尚有十艘左右，又其補助空母半數以上已被撃沉毀，不能使用，據本人判斷，美國航空母艦總數，已減至半數以下。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭　三年來狀況</h3>
<p>岸情報部長廣播詞南京六日中央社電（續昨）英美對戰爭的眞意何在，不論他們如何宣傳，其作戰目的亦無須反覆研討。我見藉此機會，略談英人的殘忍性。他們對我大東亞民族究想如何措置，實在有一談的價值。美人雖自稱爲有敎養的國民，而在世界的歷史上，嘗發現了他的殘虐行爲。美人自詡爲高尚國民，誠然是恬不知恥。美國人民以日本兵的遺骸作玩具，於日本傷兵身上開駛戰車，世界人士對此舉動，無不非常驚異。反視日本在所羅門行經美兵遺骸時候，不但沒有侮蔑的行動，而且對他們敬禮。又如緬甸旦軍部隊，在撃墜的英機傍建立紀念碑，以慰英機師的在天之靈。因爲從日本武士道的信條來看，爲祖國犧牲自己者乃爲英雄，在此塲合，並無敵我之分。可是美軍的冒凟日軍死體，　撃日蚊病院船，槍撃無辜學童，試問其動機何在，不外出於他們的優越惑。症狀國第三艦隊司令哈爾塞，曾經呼日人和東亞人爲「猿」。美人一味抱了他們應該支配有色人種的信條，他們已經忘却當我們東亞人已經居住在完備的房屋裏時，他們祖先還居住在洞穴中，或是原始的小屋之中。他們的祖先用手指抓食物的時候，中日兩男人早已恰使用竹箸了。這種事實，他們豈有不知，現在他們反把比自己爲優秀的東亞人視之爲「猿」，確是蹂躪道德的舉動。（未完）</p>
<h3>渝美機襲南滿　被撃落數架</h3>
<p>新京七日中央社電駐渝美空軍B29型機數十架，七日上午十時至十時半許，來製南滿地區，由於日空軍之邀擊，擊落其中數架，於被擊落之敵機中，有一架爲滿州國軍機一架衝撞所獲之戰果。</p>
<h3>中野衝撞戰鬥落敵機生還</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日九時發表：本月三日於東京附近邀擊B29型敵機之戰鬥中，現判明特別攻繫隊震天制空隊隊員，陸軍下士中野松美當時亦以衝撞戰鬥，擊落敵機一架而生還。</p>
<h3>首次專員會議　圓滿閉幕</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　內政所部召開之第一次各省巿行政督察專員會議，於七日上午九時仍在該部大禮堂於梅部長王持下，舉行第三次會議，討論各組審查完畢之議案。出列席四十餘人，全部提案計公民財建敎　保及其他六類，總計通過六十案，至十二時大會討論各項議案完畢，旋即舉行閉會式</p>
<h3>越南方面日軍　進入廣西省</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日大本營七日下午一時三十分發表，越南方面日軍與自南寗方面南下之日軍相策應，於十一月二十八日晨於諒山附近，突破國境綫，進入廣西省，擊潰該地渝軍，現復進擊中</p>
<p>憑祥七日中央社電　憑祥於日軍佔領後，現已急速回復治安，住民亦紛紛歸來。一部地方有力人士，並奮起組織憑祥縣救濟會，着手救濟難民。縣政府之組成，亦不日可實現。又三日正午，救濟會舉行縣民衆大會，宣誓決與日本協力云。</p>
<p>日軍佔領思樂</p>

<h3>爭取决戰勝利　後方努力增產　川本陸軍部長炎話</h3>
<p>日駐華派遣軍上海陸軍部部長川本少將於大東亞戰爭三週年紀念特發表談話如左：</p>
<p>不敗態勢</p>
<p>「於茲欣迎大東亞戰爭三週年之今日戰局正進入重大轉換之期三年前之今日，帝國忍無可忍，而且真珠灣之強襲，揭開戰號之始，特積年之鬰憤，洩之於一旦日軍所向無敵，於緒戰之初，即樹立赫赫大戰果，邇來戰况忽弛忽緊，尤以於自去歲二月日軍瓜達爾卡納爾轉進以後，截至本年七月日薩班鈁守軍之全體玉碎殉國止，此期間內乃吾人遍歷艱辛之試蠶時期也，亦即吾人對英美激起新的淬勵情緒之時期。在此期間內，幾方於緒戰之初，所確立之不敢戰略態勢，於外形上雖似曾經歷伸縮之變化，然仍屹然不動，尤以大東亞共榮圈內各友邦之強求盟工作益形鞏固，皆與我帝國以同生共死之堅決之意，互相向打開難局之途邁進，必勝之信念有益形旺盛之狀。</p>
<p>又於我國國內後方各位之熱誠與前綫將兵之勇戰呼應，一意專心於增強戰力工作之結果，至今把握神機於戰局之全面發展上，已造成一大轉捩點，至茲蟄伏一年半以上而再奮然崛起爲謀爭取最後勝利而向敵人美英挑戰之時期，業已來臨。</p>
<p>大陸作戰</p>
<p>今歲四月由河南作戰而開端之此次大陸作戰，已席捲湖南省之大半，與由華南廣東方面發動之作戰相連繋，以時攻整個廣西省，摧毀曾爲敵駐渝美空軍牙城之衡陽桂林柳州及南寗等基地羣，使敵軍謂由大陸包圍轟炸我本土之個圖與欲以此作俏侵略中國大陸據點之敵人野心，完全粉碎。同時並由打通大陸南北從貫連絡路之事實，今後將更進一步爲追繋覆滅更向內地潰退之美根據地，確立戰略的機動態勢。又今已予抗日渝軍戰力以澈底打擊，並由廣西長驅急進，敗敵深入貴州省，日軍戰勢予渝政權以未曾有之大威脅，而使其內部發生大動搖。今中國大陸與作戰之動向相呼應，是極重大之容貌。當此之時，在大陸活躍之同胞，各位應更重新具有決意，而向達成重大任務之途邁進。</p>
<p>菲島決戰</p>
<p>另一方面戰軍於臺灣海面及菲島方面邀擊尋求速戰速決之敵太平洋軍，以特別攻繋隊爲先鋒，展開戰史上未有之壯烈激戰，重創敵兵力而使其企圖完全挫折。此戰綫之我攻擊戰力即係後方各位拚命努力增強生產之結果，此結果遂表現爲如神之航空隊之成績，與殊勳。然必勝之決定，繋於今後之努力增產，自不待言，即後方之決戰增產，立即與菲島雷伊泰灣之決戰塲相連繋，敵對於我本土及大陸要地之長距離轟炸，漸次增強，故後方亦突然化爲第一綫，在戰爭第四年以後，此戰局愈趨苛烈，決定最後勝利之迫繋，生產增進，吾人必須覺悟，於敵機轟炸之下，繼續決死之努力。」</p>
<h3>堅持必勝信念　澈底撃滅敵人　出淵部長發表談話</h3>
<p>上海日陸軍部出淵報道部長昨發表談話：回顧三年前之十二月八日，實爲東亞史上完全新出發之決定時間。值茲大東亞戰爭第三週年之今日，全戰局正在實行重大轉變，到達決戰階段。瓜達爾康納爾至塞班間之一年有半，實爲我方之隱忍雖伏時期，然此試騐之艱，決非無意差加於日本國民身上，我一億國民，能忍耐苦艱，愈堅持必勝之信念。</p>
<p>徹底覆滅美軍基地</p>
<p>比試練結果鬰勃之日本，憤怒一度噴出者，即爲最近臺灣海面擊滅美艦隊之大戰果，又成爲以雷伊泰島爲中心菲島方面擊碎艦敵之一大攻勞。我特別攻擊隊在雷伊泰島之忠烈無比之勇姿，不過爲一億國民奮激之結晶，對就敵美英之正義憤怒而已。是故以雷伊泰島爲富前決戰塲之全戰局已逐漸顯著急爭度之轉變。另一面於大陸戰綫方面，本年四月日軍由河南開始發動之一大作戰，遍經湖南廣西兩省，繼之更向貴州省內之深處進攻，且由越南方面開始新攻勢之部隊，業已備受於南寗方面與大陸方面作戰之日軍相完成携手之體勢，此已如日大本營所發表。至茲中國大陸已爲此日軍縱貫南北之綫，而完全截斷償兩部，一掃當面敵美於西南地區侵略中國大陸之據點，同時更爲謀澈底覆滅退至內地而執拗策謀再起之美根據地，已確立戰略的機動態勢。</p>
<p>敵人迷夢已被粉碎</p>
<p>重慶政權事變以來，所未曾經歷過之一大威脅，而該政權之內部亦正發生重大動搖，最近蔣政權之立塲，亦於內外兩面均有微妙之動向。今大陸之情況，將隨作戰之動向，而將有重大局勢呈現。於中國大陸活躍中之各位同胞，今日更切實希望各位一新自之認識與決意，努力完成各位所肩負之重大任務。美英之當事者近來亦宣稱「對日戰事決非一朝一夕內所可了結者」，方今敵人一向誇恃以速戰速決擊敗日本之迷夢已被粉碎，而不得不決定作長期戰之準備突。</p>
<p>但敵尙恃其物資數量，在太平洋方面強行么攻，以菲島爲中心，同時並將B29　型長遠程轟炸之重戰，設於日本本土及沿本土之中國大陸方面要地，謂妨害我國增強生產，及擾亂國內，爲加以澈底打擊，使不能再起起見，吾人今後亦必須需更進一步之決意，真正之戰爭，正在今後，但決定最後之勝利者，乃繋於後方決戰生產之增強，是否得能強有力進行迄至最後之一點。</p>
<p>敵亦深知此一點，故轟炸我本土，企圖阻碍我增強生產，今後當然不可不知本土及沿本土之地域，名實上均成爲第一綫，後方之增強決戰生產，非在敵轟炸之下，以決死實行不可，一億國民真正不遺一人，必須有特別攻擊隊員之覺悟。</p>
<h3>日軍密切協力　完成作戰目的　近藤司令官發表談話</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊近藤司令官爲大東亞戰爭三周年紀念，發表談話：「今日逢大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日，回顧過去三年間，日軍奮戰戰績，並思及將來責任，誠覺感慨無量。在天皇威稜之下，擊滅英美之偉業，日有進展。大東亞諸國，亦正向建設之途邁進，確立其基礎。然英美野心，始終加強其反攻，目下以菲島方面爲中心，日美決戰日益白勢化。當茲時際，中國方面艦隊，與駐華派遣軍密切協力，體奉聖諭，爲完成作戰目的邁進。按過去一年間，戰局推移，中國方面在戰略上之地位更趨重大，敵人英美今後之企圖，與重慶之動向，亦應深切加以注意。</p>
<p>華陸海軍，在大陸方面進行先發制人之戰略，對敵人之進攻，予以痛擊，但今後情勢，決不容有一分鐘之茍安，我全體將士，受優渥勅語之感奮，誓以完成作戰。</p>
<p>另一方面，大陸方面我方新政策之進行，與中日合作建設之進展，刻正打破各種困難，秉共生共死之決意，加以革新，加以充實。孫文先生與汪先生之遺志，爲求中日兩民族之永遠福祉，必須貫澈到底。最後對中日兩國陣亡將士深致哀悼，並對盟邦各國人士，所予友情與協助表明謝意。」</p>
<h3>勗勉市民協力戰爭　吳秘書長發表談話</h3>
<p>今日爲大東亞戰爭三週紀念日，市府吳秘書長發表談話如下：「自盟邦日本發動大東亞戰爭以來，於茲已屆三年，在此三年之中，盟邦陸海空軍戰無不勝，攻無不克，粉碎英美艦踞東亞侵略勢力，最近復在台灣，菲律賓收獲偉大戰果，實已進入決勝階段。回憶戰爭初起，我中央政府即發表聲明與日本同甘共苦，並進而對英美宣戰，以共死之決心，求共榮之實現，戰爭乃有順利之推展，且因中日滿緊密提携，東亞其他各民族，亦皆體認此次戰爭爲爭取東亞全民族解放之革命鬥爭，從而一致崛起，採取同一行動，分担勞苦努力於英美殘餘勢力之肅清，及大東亞建設之完成，三年之成就，已足超於理想，因能確立東亞共榮圈踏入第四年之際，吾人除對三年來盟邦日本之偉績，致其最大敬外，更應深切體認戰爭勝利，愈加迫近，則一切困苦愈應忍受，一切艱難愈應克服，惟有謹守主席遺訓所指示，依據中日同盟條約及大東亞菜同宣主之精神，盡其最大之努力，始可迎接光明之來臨。凡我市民，其各自勉。」</p>
<h3>明日防空日演習　防空戰鬥</h3>
<p>明（九）日爲第十二次防空日是，市民防空本部循例舉行各項防空訓練，警報訓練之時間，業經規定，已於（四）日各報刋載。惟在訓練警報發令中，如遇必須發放真實警報之事態時，則以下各項措置：（一）訓練警報發令中，如遇真實警戒警報之狀態，則不再發出警報，反主之，如訓練警戒警報發令中，已逾越規定時間時，則已入真實之警報狀態中。（二）訓練警報雖已屆解除時間，如事實上防空事態尙示完畢，則亦不發解除訓練警報。（三）訓練空襲警報發令中，如遇必須發出真實之空襲警報事態時，亦不再鳴發空襲警報，反言之，如在訓練空襲警報發令中，如已逾越規定時間時，已爲真實之空襲警報，市民當注意及之。</p>
<p>假想敵機防空戰鬥</p>
<p>爲澈底實施待避訓練，明日上午幾時至九時十五分之第一次訓練空襲警報時，有假想敵機起飛上空，作劇烈之防空戰鬥，市民當急速避害難，警察官與保甲防空人員，更當指導市民，實施避難，街道里巷當無人跡，以期熟練。是時防空監視哨發覺假想敵機臨空時，更當急速通知聯絡班傳報全區，實施待避訓練。</p>
<p>市民均須參加訓練</p>
<p>同時爲使市民熟練各項必要措置，規定各地區實施各項綜合之主要訓練時，訓練地點市民當全體參加，協助保甲防空人員實施救護，消防，滅彈待避等各項防空工作，絕對不得袖手旁觀，甚且拍手呌好等情事發生。其中緊急救護工作需要人員與支術，無論家庭防空或團體防空，必須準備全副器具，挑選擇合格人員擔任。是日黃浦老閘等區將實施大規模救護訓練，總之，對各項防空訓練，以及交通管制燈火管制，市民均須認真實施，不得有所規避或疏忽。</p>
<h3>首期棉布配給　發售七十萬匹</h3>

<h3>敵軍臨潰滅之境　必勝之道暢開　溱海軍武官長談話</h3>
<p>在菲島進行大決戰時，而迎大東亞戰爭三週年紀念日，我等實有無窮之感慨，試觀過去三年之戰績，我等陸海軍進行雄渾無比之大作戰，今在絕對之必勝信念下，與盟邦諸國密切連繋，以期完遂聖戰目的。</p>
<p>敵方佔領塞班島，又突入雷伊泰島，又對我方本土再三空襲，而以戰局之全般趨勢觀之，我方則取絕對不敗之態勢，於中國大陸建立赫赫戰果，均逐漸向擊滅傲敵之途邁進。至今日止，敵方之艦船飛機及兵員已遭極大犧牲，更於最近菲島方面之作戰，受到巨大打擊，敵方今已將近達潰滅之境，而深感我軍必勝之大道，更爲暢開，而實現大東亞十億民族之理想之確信，更深刻。</p>
<p>當此決戰之秋，中國方面艦隊與陸軍部隊緊密協力之下，亦擔當太平洋決戰之一翼，勇往邁進，以期突破難開，完成重要使命，而更爲實現東亞興隆，傾注獅子奮進之努力，與盟邦德國國民，突破歷史上空前之困難情勢，敢然目指最後之勝利，努力奮鬥。</p>
<p>敵方英美常以日德之潰滅之豪語自誇，而最近又誇大宣反軸心國軍之戰果，而實際彼等以此掩避等之戰敗耳。</p>
<p>我等於大東亞戰爭第四年之際，當將驕敵英美澈底撃滅，以期實現東亞十億民族，及歐洲盟邦民族之永遠之理想。</p>

<p>在大陸前綫欣逢大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日，煊　戰果之下，得以向大東亞建設邁進，實感無上光榮。中國方面艦隊之任務，乃協助在華陸軍部隊，以陸海空三面作戰，完成大東亞戰爭目的，同時促進所要之政策。主要任務，乃封鎖中國沒岸二千八百五十海里，制壓敵人破壞通商之蠢動，確保揚子江珠江等流域動脈之交通綫，又協助陸軍殲滅渝軍根絕英美策動。此次大東亞戰爭中，若以太平洋爲表，則中國沒海宛如裏。</p>
<p>太平洋與大陸問題</p>
<p>回顧過去一年間戰况，可窺見太平洋問題與大陸問題之關聯。去年九月意大利投降後，世界情勢變化，十二月以來，德蘇戰事急轉直下，一方面美國以急進的物力爲背景，於太平洋中反攻，使中國戰綫蒙到複雜影響，因此在中國大陸之英美殲滅戰，自靜的狀態而變爲動的狀態，與太平洋爲裏表的中國戰塲，今已展開在攻戰兩路上極重大的塲面，尤其因中國現狀複雜，於政略之思想戰方面，正是此次大東亞戰爭中之白熱塲面。所以中國實爲大東亞戰爭之病根，因病源日惡，故已發炎而延至亞洲大半，及太平洋，世界一切變化，一一敏感地對中國有影響，由此可知中國戰綫之重大性。</p>
<p>日陸海軍先發制人</p>
<p>回顧過去一年，渝軍雖常呼反攻，但始終受日軍先發制人，仍站於被動地位，如桂林柳州南寗等西南要鎭，相繼攻陷，已呈最後的掙扎至於美軍行動，是由駐渝美空軍及中國沿海出沒之美潛水艇，以破壞日方交通綫爲主，漸有積極之勢。七月上旬起，開始以B29空襲日本本土，其間特別應予注意的，即美太平洋艦隊司令官尼米資等聲明，欲橫斷太平洋直抵中國大陸登岸。又三月一日，史蒂維爾亦聲稱美陸軍及渝軍出動印緬戰綫，暗以陸軍侵入大陸，嗣後美軍將校漸次揷足於渝軍中。尼米資攻勢之準備，正逐日進行中。對比項敵軍行動，中國方面艦隊與陸軍緊密連緊下，擊滅渝軍根絕敵空軍與潛艦之蠢動，復先發制人打破尼米資攻勢，先於十一月起至十二月初，發動常德作戰，四月中旬精銳陸軍沿粵漢綫沃野，海軍亦於長江洞庭湖湘江方面，打通極困難之舟路，任運輸補給之責，至八月二十五日，打開湘江航路爲止，於炎熱瘴癘及空軍蠢動之下，全力奮鬥。</p>
<p>克復困難完復任力</p>
<p>八月上旬進攻雷州半島，九月初起開始東南沿岸作戰，於溫州，福州，廈門等地，由海空兩面協助陸軍，一方面復協助溯珠江而上之陸軍部隊，華南海南島方面之海軍聞隊，迎擊敵方空軍。又對敵方敷設之水雷，亦一一撈除，以確保航路。其間敵性船或帆船之蠢動，在日海軍儼然行動之下，可稱絕跡。惟敵沅艦呼應美軍太平洋反攻作戰之進展，蠢動日見頻繁，與空軍聯絡，圖擾亂日方交通綫。奉命護衛海上之本艦隊，克服困難情况，頗能完成任務。一方面於海南島因其物殊環境，仍有匪賊蟠居，該地日軍除掃蕩敵性份子外，又擊滅來製敵機，及防子衛海上交通，六月初歐州第二戰綫實現後，七月美軍即伸展其魔手於馬里亞納方面，致中國方面戰局，更成大東亞戰爭之中心矣。</p>
<p>思想戰益激烈展開</p>
<p>尤其思想戰，日益激烈，或可稱之爲大東亞戰爭之核心，太平洋戰局或歐洲戰局之一舉一動，產刻由渝方的政略，影響到經濟上發生微妙的波瀾，目本之對華新政策，實可暴露此項敵性的影響。其中以世界縮圖的上海更甚，英美渝之宣傳陰謀，極爲深刻，不外離間中日兩國，其野心與手段之深且遠，患害東亞民族，實覺痛憤，剷除此項禍根，即大東亞戰爭之價意。</p>
<p>中國成最後決戰塲</p>
<p>又中國方面，預測將來不難成爲英美對日最後之決戰塲，不論在政略上即戰略上最近已有實現之勢。本年初尙僅三百數十架之在渝美空軍，至今已增到七百架，又B29以成都俏中繼基地，常自印度方面出現於大陸及太平洋方面。又英美軍爲謀於大陸登岸，正忙於蒐集情報及攫取根據地，一方面假進緬甸之萊特公路，加緊建設中，又如對渝軍增加供給武器，并施美國式訓練，揷入大批幹部等，此外像華雷期，納爾遜，哈萊等美重要政治人物，不絕赴渝，玩弄各種策謀，全力防止渝方脫離反軸心陣綫，或以戰後政策籠絡渝方，可知英美世界政策上，如何重視中國。</p>
<p>上海方面民衆動向</p>
<p>對於上海方面，最近敵機頻來襲，大都爲空製日本時之牽制行動，或是神經戰，並無任何損害，惟對當地民心及經濟界不無影響，今後須予以警戒，中國民衆之動向往往爲英美宣傳所左右，但今有識華人對神風特擊隊或陸軍特攻隊之義烈，因同爲東洋民族故無不感激，憂慮東亞前途之愛國青少年，亦頗值得重視，如爲感謝日方戰果，獻機運動等殊爲熱烈，不久前海軍保甲獻機達數十架之多。</p>
<p>菲島戰局對日有利</p>
<p>今戰局以菲島爲中心，正對日本有利展開，過去煊赫戰果之護花充，與今後重大使命之完成，大和民族當發揮最高度之力量，築成必勝堅壘，完成擊滅英美之夙願，以上奉聖明，下報殉國烈士</p>
<p>際此時會，中國方面艦隊將兵，恭拜十一月十二日所賜動語感奮興起，士氣日益旺盛，正向完成最後目的邁進，且確信由於盟邦各國一致協力，定能完成建設世界和平之偉業，並招致燦爛光明之有途。</p>
<h3>重慶的期待　已被辜負了</h3>
<p>— 張太湖</p>
<p>世界各國中，最最渴望而虔心祈禱日本與英美開戰的，便是重慶政權。因此，民國三十年十二月八日清晨，日美英戰爭之幕一揭開，待之已久的重慶政權，當即對日宣戰，進而參加反軸心陣營。</p>
<p>重慶爲什麼渴望着祈禱着日美英開戰呢？在今日，想必誰都知道其理由了。茲爲叙述便利起見，將理由簡潔地說明一下。原來重慶過於信仰英美，特輥是美國的軍事力量及其豐富的物資，以爲一旦日本與英美開戰，英美的強大軍事力最即可擊潰日軍，使日本無條件地屈服。由於這種錯誤的信心，重慶便一心一意渴望祈求日本與英美交戰了。</p>
<p>當日美英戰爭（大東亞戰爭）爆發稍前，重慶政權的情形，可說正瀕於崩潰的窘境。自從蘆溝橋事變勃發以來，當時已四年有餘，在精銳日軍的猛攻下，連戰連北，喪失了廣大的土地，不論在軍事上或經濟上，都陷於非常窮困的境地，而生慶要人也失去了擊退日軍完成「抗建」的自信，並目認常此以往，捨「沒落」以外，另無他途，因而焦慮着有無解救的辦法。當渝方人士正在日夜思慮打開困境，挽回頹勢的方法時，日美兩國，開始談判。由於美國方面的傲慢，日美會談的時行，難關重重，至民國三十年八月，就是局外人也感覺到日美的開戰是不可避免的事了。看到這種情形，比誰都開心的，便是重慶。及至是年十二月八日，日美英戰爭終於如重慶所望的一樣揭幕了。據當時的重慶來電稱，接到日本與英美開戰的民報時，渝方人士無不愁頓展，欣然而喜。這是當然的，因爲重慶所祈禱的事情是實現了。可是，重慶所祈求的目的，果眞達到了吧？英美沒有辜負了重慶的期待嗎？又，日本與英美開戰以後，重慶能獲得所望的收獲嗎？</p>
<p>正如大東亞戰爭這三年來的過程及現在的戰局所明示，重慶對於日美英戰爭所抱的希望，是完全事與願違了。不僅事實與期待相反，並且所負的担子也越來越重，其立塲也日益困難。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭初起時，重慶方面預料開戰後半載，至遲一年左右，英美軍將澈底潰日軍，逼令日本無條件屈服，所以重慶可坐待擊退日軍，達到「抗建」目的。不料戰爭的實際經過完全不是如此，由於日軍的勇敢善戰，渝方的預料終於化爲幻想。料想英美軍只要半年就可澈底擊破日軍而懷抱着大希望，豈知竟是大錯特錯，這點是渝方人士自已承認而又後悔不迭的。渝方對於英美的期待，是化爲泡影了。</p>
<p>英美軍在開戰以後，並不能立刻擊潰日軍，大東亞戰爭顯然成爲畏期戰，重慶於是大感失望，陷於苦悶和悲　的深淵中，因爲重慶直覺地感到必須從事比大東亞戰爭開始前更困難的對日戰爭。渝方的這種感覺，是確實的，此事現正日益實現。最好不過的證據，便是大東亞戰爭爆發後中國戰塲上的戰局推移。大東亞戰爭揭幕後，日軍雖傾全力和正面的敵英美軍展開劇戰，但中國戰塲上的戰事並未中止。而且，非獨沒有休止，並和對付英美的作戰呼應，相繼展開河南作戰，湖南作戰等，迄今且已席捲廣西的重要地區，而有力的先鋒部隊更突破貴州省境，以破竹之勢，向貴州省中必部分挺進。日軍一面以強敵英美爲對手，展開堆渾的作戰，一面又在中國戰綫實行如此大規模的作虞，這是重慶在在東亞戰爭勃發當時所夢想不到的。　　大東亞戰爭固如重慶所望一樣而開始，但渝方軍事上的負担，一點不曾減輕，全線受到日軍的高壓，抗戰的困難數倍於前，而且依然連戰北，豫湘先後不守，廣西要衡也全部失陷，無法阻止怒濤般向內地進攻的日軍。到了今日，重慶的祈求日本與英美開戰，以及得悉開戰消息而雀躍等等，反成爲可笑的事了。現在，重慶正躑躅於依賴他人者所必經的途徑，他們因所望未遂而受垤的精神上的打擊，以及由於目前局勢而生的內在苦悶，其嚴重深刻，實在局外人的想像以上。</p>
<p>重慶政權的立塲，由於大東亞戰爭爆發的結果，更爲困難。蜞　精神上物質上的負擔更爲加重的原因，與其說是日軍對於大陸作戰不稍緩手，毋寗關爲重慶得參大東亞戰爭揭幕而爲糊地對日宣戰，自動參加英美陣營的必然結果，較爲妥當。</p>
<p>英美在大東亞戰爭以前，承認重慶是近於完全的獨立政權，在某種程度之下，頗尊重其自主性，而在精神上予以聲援，在物質上供以軍需物資。總之，僅止於直接間接與以援助，並不敢怎樣嚴重壓迫，當時，他們雖有使重慶勝利的心理，但那時從美國看來，重慶畢竟是外人，對於中日事變多少懷有隔岸觀火的心情；這是無可否認的事實。換言之，當時美國固然有希望重慶勝利的心，但是如果敗了，美國也只覺得這是沒有法子的事情罷了。可是，一待大東亞戰爭開始，日本成爲英美正面的敵人，所以當重慶投入他們的陳營中去時，英美，特別是美國，便急連變更對渝的態度。這就是說，他們捨棄過去承認重慶政權的獨立性並尊重其目主性的態度，改取澈底利用重慶，以其所轄區域爲對日戰立足地的態度，以期戰勝日本。美國旣然爲了對日戰爭而利用重慶，並且以其治下區域爲立足點，對於重慶，在軍事上經濟上當然要逐步加上重壓了。現在，不論軍事上或經濟上，重慶已在要國的卵蠶之下。這是大家都已知道了的。在美國的心目中，已經完全沒有重慶的獨立性自主性了。這固然是渝方完全不曾預料到的現象，但這也是重慶所祈求的大東亞戰爭實現以後必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>重慶所虔心祈求渴望的大東亞戰爭，自從開始以來，迄已實足三年。然而重慶對於此戰的爆發及其結果所抱的種種希望，一個也未實現，事實完全出於意料之外。單只意外地不能實現所期待者，那倒還好。可是，大東亞戰爭勃發的結果，已使重慶的立塲益亂，負擔愈得，而其苦悶也更回深刻。當此大東亞戰爭三週年時，重慶人士緬懷旣往，將發生什麼惑想呢？「依賴他人者必致自亡」，這句話一語道破真理。如能切實覺悟這迠，實爲重慶之幸</p>
<h3>中國方面艦隊　一年來戰鬭槪况</h3>
<p>中國方面艦隊一年來戰鬥之一般槪况，殆因駐渝美空軍之量之增加而移向於航空戰。</p>
<p>自然，我中國方面海軍部隊對之嚴重監視其動向，準備次期作戰而積極整頓戰備。茲試考察一年來之槪况如次：</p>
<p>在揚子江方面，當本年三月之漲水期，敵流放機雷，土匪亦漸次蠢動，以爲策應。至四月，揚子江岸蠢動之敵匪，從事妨害江上交通之企圖，某出擊亦現頻繁之傾向。</p>
<p>此時敵機對江上地區之空襲，比較寗靜，其機種亦大槪爲P三八，P四〇，P五一等。</p>
<p>五月，陸軍部隊展開湖南進攻作戰。敵空軍之出擊愈執拗。彼等之攻擊目標亦集中於江岸之軍事設施，並破壞航行中之舟艇，兵站綫。</p>
<p>然由於湖南進攻作戰，我陸海軍之密切合作及果敢攻擊，使該方而敵人作極微弱之抵坑，我方着着完成預期之作戰目的。</p>
<p>但駐渝美空軍之活動，相當活潑，五月下旬以來，集中其行動之重心於我方之後方運輸，或物資集積地點，專事反覆夜間攻擊。</p>
<p>惟我方之閒動水路工作，突破此種障礙，遂行其任力，與陸軍部隊之向內地進攻，一同粉碎，殘敵對警備地區之侵入及敵機之游擊式出擊。</p>
<p>六月五日，營田陷落後，駐渝美機B二四之出現，數量突增，尤其對武漢地區之來襲更見加緊。</p>
<p>七月中旬，敵空軍以主力對湘江流域集中攻擊，企釁遮斷我方補給路，由於我方果敢應戰，其野心悉成泡影。</p>
<p>八月上旬，敵因蜞　要衝陽之失陷，急起妨害揚子江上之交通，並破壞軍事設施，甚至在飛機上目綴日丸標識，突然前來盲炸。完全蔑視國際道義，欲用期瞞策以逞其反攻。八月二十五日，我海軍部隊打開困難之湘江水路卒告成功，於湖南戰役上樹立不朽　動。</p>
<p>華南方面</p>
<p>華南方面，本年初以來，敵潛水艦略有出現，海上游匪對西南諸島及浙東方面有企圖擾亂治安之傾，被我察覺，加以駐渝美空軍之出擊企圖，依然濃厚，但由我方戒備嚴密，自三月以來，其動向漸趨消極。</p>
<p>他面，本年五月敵潛水艦之出現略見頻繁。至六七月，再見減少。六月後，敵之航空作戰漸見活潑化，此外，駐渝美空軍之空襲北九州，呼應歐洲方面反軸心之積極攻勢，或太平洋方面之戰局，而漸呈決戰狀態。然敵機之出擊，由於我方防術周密，不知所措，乃僅對日本本土佯作空襲，甚至神經戰。</p>
<p>最近並爲應付敵之執拗的機雷戰，澈底強化掃海，以確保治岸航路之安全，並當我船舶航力航駛時，各營戒隊，掃蕩隊，航空部隊等直接間接完成護衛之任備，並哨戒航駛前後之航路，臨險船舶，無慮數萬以上。</p>
<p>海南島方面</p>
<p>海南島方面之戰鬥經過，先是，四月中旬以來，敵機利用月明之夜，採勢拗之空襲戰法。其來襲狀况亦趨於南北二商學院。然其戰力頗緩和，以B二四爲主，專事企圖攻擊停泊中船舶。</p>
<p>而本島內之共匪，將殘餘勢力重行編組，漸次伸張其勢力，以擴大地盤。但六月下旬以來，我方先行發動討伐，阻止其蠢動，加以衣食困迫，愈助長敵之歸順投降。</p>
<p>華中方面</p>
<p>華中方面作戰之進展，必然減少駐渝美空軍對本島方面之來襲，然敵人並不停止其船舶，港灣設施之偵察，被我果敢攻擊，每次侵入均告擊退，七月以來，其行動不出偵察看程度，倉皇失措。</p>
<p>八月上旬以來，敵企圖從雷州半島及大陸向本島偷運兵器物資，但因被我封鎖，徹底蕩近海之私運帆船等，頗著效果。</p>
<p>又十月以來，駐渝美空軍出擊次數又見加多，以P三八·P四〇爲主，企圖偵察轟炸。因我方嚴密戒備，毫無效果，其出擊亦僅神經戰性質之戰術而已。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭　第一年記</h3>
<p>— 金星</p>
<p>一九四一年十二月八日大東亞戰爭爆發前，日本在國際上的形勢是不利的，英美一方面加緊日本的封鎖，「遠東積極」政策，別一方面，却使美駐日大合格魯；英駐日大合克來琪以親日的姿態出現着，對日進行着所謂「綏靖政策」。日本也明知共故；也展開了對英美的外交攻勢。野村和來栖的赴開卷有益固然在轉圜於眞正和平的實現，但是日本方面却有着萬全的整備。</p>
<p>德蘇戰爭當科季作戰開始之後，德國軍隊包圍了莫斯科，終因氣候嚴寒由尖銳的攻勢改爲鞏固陣地的守勢。英美於是乘此時機來加強對日本的壓迫，十二月八日對英美的宣戰大詔終於懷閃電般頒發了。</p>
<p>八日上午六時，日本大本營陸海軍發表：「帝國陸海軍在西太平洋襲英美人戰鬥狀態」。</p>
<p>夏威夷海戰</p>
<p>日本海軍猛然圖破了美國的生命綫—夏威夷。據雷時發表夏威夷　戰詳報，護方面美國海軍，已覆滅。主要戰集　：（一）　洋戰艦　五，甲　　洋艦二，　　生艦二。（二）　　戰艦四，　巡洋艦二，　　巡洋艦四，驅逐艦二。　敵陸海航空兵力損　飛機約五址架，　　上四架。又日潛艇　　戰艦一。</p>

<p>進駐泰國</p>
<p>日本進駐泰國，獲得了與越南進攻馬來的根據地，日　以隔　馬來和緬甸陸上的交通聯絡，同時又威脅滇緬絡。</p>
<p>十一日泰政府宣布日泰攻守同體。翌十一月一十五日正式對英　兩國宣戰。在大東亞戰爭中，日本百　　得了泰國友軍。</p>
<p>馬來亞海戰</p>
<p>在開戰三日內，日本海軍航空部隊，在馬來半島東海岸，　捕英國遠東艦隊主力，轟沉戰艦　泊　斯號和旗艦所謂不沉的威爾斯號。英美總參謀部大受震動，該兩國人民大起責難，於是他們在東亞的海空軍與作戰指揮系統不得不重爲編制，在歐洲進行第二戰綫因此停止。</p>
<p>在戰爭之初，日軍除大襲夏威夷之外，更撤破馬尼拉，新加坡等英美軍事據點，且將他們的主力艦隊擈滅。在一星期內美國在太平洋中央進攻日本的路綫竟被澈底破壞。</p>
<p>佔領香港</p>
<p>八日晨華南方面日本陸軍航空隊爭襲九龍機塲。九日晚陸軍已攻入九龍背面防綫。十二日向九龍推進，消滅英軍。十四日晨，總攻香港。二十五日下午港督無條件降，二十六日日軍進駐香港。</p>
<p>菲律賓戰役</p>
<p>十二月八日日曬陸海軍航空隊急襲菲律賓美方飛機塲及航空隊，給予攻命打擊。十日晨前開始於呂宋島西北岸西阿帕爭　處敵有登陸上是謂無由登陸。二十二日日本士力在馬星拉北方的林家恩灣登陸。二十四至二十七日，各地相繼登陸。元旦日日軍完全佔　馬尼拉。至五月上旬日軍領有菲律賓全部。</p>
<p>婆羅洲戰役</p>
<p>婆羅洲爲世界第二大島，英屬佔七分之二，北部岸乃石油產地。十二月十六日日軍在本洲登陸與香港馬來菲律賓呼應，控制了整個南中國海。經過一月血戰至二月四日便完全佔有英領婆羅洲。</p>
<p>新加坡戰役</p>
<p>日軍於十二月八日向馬來半島登陸，十七日佔檳榔嶼。一月三日佔克阿恩泰航空根據地。二十三日，佔有世界第一產錫地的泰依濱，復渡班拉海，攻佔怡保。一月三十一日陷落柔佛巴哈爾。計五十餘日，日軍推進一千一百公里，行軍神速，前所未有。</p>
<p>新加坡是英國侵略東亞的軍事要塞，費了遙長的時間，四萬萬元的經費，盡費經營終於成爲日軍的目標了。二月八日開始向新加坡進攻。十一日攻取布克台麥山。十四日開始新加坡巷戰，翌日完全佔領。此役戰果據計俘虜英軍九萬五千名，及其他大量軍用島。給予英國一個極大的　　邱吉爾內開竟一度發生危機。在大東亞戰史上識爲極　貴的一　。</p>
<p>荷印戰役</p>
<p>荷屬東印度是ABCD陳綫中主要的一環。當日軍在英屬波羅洲　善連行時。對荷屬東印度各地亦大施轟炸。一月十一日日軍在東海岸塔拉干登陸。二十五日佔領油田區八里巴板，一月二十七日西部婆羅洲復經戡定。</p>
<p>至三月中旬佔有荷領婆羅洲之全部。</p>
<p>另外日軍在一月二十六日進入巽他羣島中西里伯島給予澳大利亞一大威脅。二月下旬，日軍攻佔蘇門答臘的南部。經過了爪哇海戰，日軍於三月一日又在爪哇三方面登陸。三月五日荷印首都巴達維亞全部戡定，三天後荷印總督與聯軍長官乃向日軍　降。</p>
<p>緬甸戰役</p>
<p>一九四二年二月下旬，日本陸軍部隊，山深圖攻入緬甸，海軍又呼　地決定消滅孟加拉灣的英艦隊。三月初旬，英國在孟加拉灣的損害極大，日機且向錫蘭島空襲，不斷轟炸港內軍艦，巡洋空母次第炸沈。此後日特潛艇並向印度洋西山岸泊等，所護戰果頗鉅。</p>
<p>日軍在緬甸陸上之戰，則自三月三日起總攻仰光，五天後全部佔領。重慶即行　兵救畏，立營未定，英軍大批潰退。四月二十九日日軍佔臘成，五月初繼下瓦城，入草。重慶重隊便　切斷。五四日日軍進入龍陵，不五天而攻　　，　　了滇省的安全。日軍已湧到印度的　　。印度被壓迫民族　　在大東亞戰爭中搶頭起來了。</p>
<p>襲美國本土</p>
<p>美國太平洋沿岸的海上交通在大東亞虎爭中也開始被日本潛艇威脅着。十二月八日百浬美運輸隊被襲。十一日美當局報告美運油船被襲。十二月三十日本潛伊港。二月二十四日日軍開始砲轟美加利福尼亞州沿岸軍事設施獲得重大戰果。美全國震驚。</p>
<p>遠征阿留申</p>
<p>阿留申羣島人年和在冰天雪地之中。荷蘭港爲該方面最大海軍根據地。一九四一年六月四五兩日，日空母向荷蘭機塲突襲，予以得創。</p>
<p>中途島戰役</p>
<p>一九四二年六月五日，日本航空隊開始強途島航空基地。另在島之北方洋上發現美艦，加以轟炸，戰果頗多。</p>
<p>南太平洋各役</p>
<p>當東印度羣島與緬甸爭奪戰時，日軍已向南太平洋行進。</p>
<p>一九四二年一月二十四日，日軍在新幾內亞東新不列顛島與親授爾蘭島上登陸，控制了澳火利亞的咽喉。三月八日，日軍又在新幾內亞北岸沙力棉等地登陸，繼而新幾內亞的西半部，東半部如所羅門羣島大部邊續陷落。與東印度羣島構成了一條弧。英美着着失利，不得已將艦隊集中澳洲，引誘日軍北上珊瑚海，日軍乃待機而動，五月初遂有珊瑚海戰，英美損失戰艦空母及飛機不貲。</p>
<p>所羅門三海戰</p>
<p>英美爲與日本爭奪西南太平洋制海權，他們的聯合艦隊乃於八月七日向所羅門羣島中部進襲，派兵登陸，雙方空戰，英美旗艦等擊沉。八日晚更引起劇烈夜戰歷半小時，英美旗艦被告擊沈毀者十六艘。</p>
<p>第二次所羅門海戰：美新建艦艇次第出現，強力進襲瓜達爾加納爾島，八月二十四日雙方在所羅門東洋遭遇。各由飛機互炸美空母二艘起火。二次戰後，兩個月中，所羅門海面時有衝突。敵機較日損失超出四倍。</p>
<p>十月二十六日美新編大艦隊在聖大克魯茲島北洋，又與日軍　戰，美方被擊沉空母二艘，戰艦及驅逐各一，巡洋三，日方輕傷空母二，巡洋一。</p>
<p>十一月十二日引起第三次所羅門火戰：日本飛機出擊塞拉基海峽美船　。美被擊沉巡洋艦二，飛機十九架。僅送船三艘焚如。是日晚，雙方艦隊砲轟，結果美沉沒巡洋艦八艘，重傷驅逐艦六艘。十三日又繼續戰鬥。兩方各有損傷。十四日晨，日軍在瓜達爾加納爾登陸成協。夜間雙方艦隊在　報海面又起　戰。日驅逐艦單艦直入敵陣肉搏，轟沉美大巡洋艦一，沉毀驅逐艦三艘。其他日艦亦向美隊肉搏，戰果櫐櫐。</p>
<p>自八月七日首次蘇羅門海戰至十一月十四日間三次蘇羅門大戰的結果。可以想銅陵南太平洋上三次大戰的險惡情形。日本已經奪取了平洋的制海權，獲得空前勝利，確立了不敗的態勢。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭第二年記</h3>
<p>— 子晚</p>
<p>所羅門方面英美大反攻前後，日本海軍的戰果堪稱空前，打破了英美在東亞的繰大戰鬥力，確立了太平洋上的不敗基礎。在第一期，日本海軍力發揮的綜合地點是所羅門。再進一步，爲完全削斷美國澳洲間的連絡，及澳洲夏威夷間的聯繋，在南方必須建立重要的補充基地。</p>
<p>以後，必然的進入第二階段，增設海軍根據地，確保南方寶庫，佔據各據點以粉碎英美反攻。綜觀一九四三年的大東亞戰爭日軍採取了「防禦攻勢」，積極準備着軍事政治上的繼戰力，以謀將來決戰的勝利。至一九四四年，美軍反攻的重點側重於中太平洋方面，遂有馬紹爾及特羅克島方面的大戰，企謀由此前進，奪還關島和菲律賓。然而細察雙方的作戰的戰略及戰術言之，英美的反攻，殊難成就。</p>
<p>茲分述一九四三年大東亞戰爭各役於後：</p>
<p>（一）南太平洋方面</p>
<p>外圍作戰</p>
<p>美方因數次所羅門戰役慘敗之後，不得不改變了戰略，實行所謂「基地推術，」確立其點，一方面加強補給綫一方面奪取基點。日本方面當然亦竭力援助其基地，轟炸美方的運輸隊，以削弱他們的戰鬥力。因此在一九四三年初，南太平洋方面的外國作戰極爲活躍。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭必勝的面面觀</h3>
<p>— 張茜</p>
<p>（一）　現代戰爭是政治與經濟的總比賽。</p>
<p>所謂「政治」，是內政與外交；所謂「經濟」，是人力與物力。軍事勝利的基礎，便是建築在政治與經濟　兩大柱石上。因此，我們要判認戰爭的結果誰能獲得最後勝利，除須注視於軍事形勢的演進外，更須注視作戰兩方能否確保其人力資源的無慮缺乏，物力供應的不斷接濟，以及有無統一的內政。以作戰爭的後盾，和靈活的外交以作其戰爭的協助。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭自前年十二月八日揭幕之後，於今三年，其前途如何？在這三年中早已確定其命運。對於這一點，我們可以依據上述政治美經濟的情形來加以檢討。</p>
<p>（二）　我們先來檢視大東亞戰爭在經濟方面的第一類——人力的內容，是否有獲得最後勝利的把握。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發動之初，繼日本宣佈對英美作戰之後，跟着有中·滿·泰·緬·菲·印的相繼參戰，以整個東亞的民衆作爲大東亞戰爭的後盾；這在力人上佔着壓倒的優勢，，因此確立了在人力上戰勝敵英美的基礎。</p>
<p>東亞有十億民衆。這十億民衆在全世界的人口比率上，是佔着絕大的多數。以十億民衆的人力從事保衛東亞，幷從事拒抗少數而且需要兼顧東西的英美，其必能完成其使命是無待解說的。</p>
<p>孟子曾說過：「寡固不可以敵衆」。</p>
<p>以如此其「衆」的人力來排除英美侵略東亞的一部份惡勢力，其勝利是必然的。</p>
<p>——大東亞戰爭必勝，這是第一個原因。</p>
<p>（三）　大東亞戰爭在經濟方面的第二類－－物力的量，是否足以蔪致最後的勝利呢？這也有待於檢討。</p>
<p>英美本土因各種生產資源不足，而需榨取自各殖民地上，這是人盡皆知的事實。至於英美所依恃爲生產供應的生命綫－－各殖民地，大部散佈在南太平洋上的島嶼，如馬來半島，新加坡，蘇門答臘，爪哇，新幾內亞，婆羅洲，菲律賓。……然而，大東亞戰　發動之後，這些涵藏着豐富物力的東亞領土，不旋踵而由英美手中全部移到了日軍的手中。日本的軍力，從此把英美物力上的生命綫切斷了。</p>
<p>英美方面失去了恃之以作爭覇太平洋的物力資源。</p>
<p>日本方面增添了保衛東亞所需的物力資源。</p>
<p>如是，一正一負，英美和日本之間的物力差數，便益巨大。有着這巨大的物力供應資源的大東亞戰爭，其勝利是必然的。</p>
<p>－－大東亞戰爭必勝，這是第二個原因。</p>
<p>其次，我們得談到關於大東亞戰爭的政治方面的第一類－內政問題了。</p>
<p>這裏所謂「內政」問題，並不是各個單位國家的內政問題，而是指整個大東亞各民族團結一致的內在問題而言。</p>
<p>然則，大東亞各民族能否在同一戰綫上，齊一其步伐呢？</p>
<p>鐵樣的事實擺我們的眼前——</p>
<p>日本宣佈：大東亞戰爭是整個東亞民族要求共榮共存，確保東亞永遠和平的戰爭；於是，中國誓以俱誠表示「同生共死」，滿洲國表示堅決協力。相繼而夾的，從泰國，緬甸，菲律賓……以至整個東亞領域的各民族，以「大東亞宣言」表示出他們團結一致的熱誠，齊一步伐的決意。這無異是向英美擊出的巨拳，這巨拳在吿訴英美：東亞各民族在團結一致的眞誠中，　與英美作戰到底，以共求解放。</p>
<p>古語有云：「天時不如地利，地利不如人和。」</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭俱有「人和」的優越條件，則勝利還有什麽疑義？</p>
<p>－大東亞戰爭必勝，這是第三個原因。</p>
<p>那末政治方面的第二類——外交形勢如何呢？</p>
<p>整個東亞成爲一個一國家集團」之後的外交問題，便不是集團以內的國家應如何緊握其協力的手，並永遠堅持初衷的問題，而是如何在集團之外，獲取有力的與國的問題。</p>
<p>關於這，我們應着眼的地方，是東亞軸心與歐洲軸心的聯　上。</p>
<p>東亞軸心與歐洲軸心的聯繫始終是那樣的堅强，這是大東亞戰爭在外交上獲得的輝煌戰果。我們姑不諭歐洲軸心在今日的遭遇如何，但歐洲軸心形成對英美的一個絕大的壓力·這是無從粉飾的事實。這事實對於大東亞戰爭增添了無限的勝利把握。</p>
<p>英美在歐洲軸心的爆擊下，牽制了大部軍力，即使還存着用其一部份力量侵擾東亞的野望。則其在整個東亞軸心的總力之前，是如何的渺小！　「哈爾　率領之第三艦隊及史蔳蒲安斯率領之第五艦隊，……於十月十日以來，在琉球　　發動，經作戰後，第三艦隊之主力，已將其擊滅；其次，美麥克沃塞經新　內亞侵人雷伊秦灣，自十月十九日以來，自毫灣海面至菲律賓海面，經日本陸海軍航空部隊之奮勇作戰，及日本聯合艦隊之出動，將敵方精銳予以消滅。」</p>
<p>——翅騙會，　實了大　　　爭在外交的　利建中，收獲到軍事上的勝利</p>
<p>——大東亞織爭必勝，這是第四　原因。</p>
<p>（六）　大東亞戰爭必勝，已具備了全部條件，最後便是如何結集總力，以使用這全部優越的條件去爭取最後的勝利問題。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的勝敗，不只是日本一國的盛寰問題，而是整個東亞決定其爲奴　成主人的問題。明乎此，則除甘爲奴隸者外，都應該在爭取獨立，　由的大東亞戰爭的大　下，整齊其步伐，邁向光明之途前進，火家以一切貢獻給東亞永久的和平工作，大家以絕對眞誠的心地，結爲「同生共死」的東亞兄弟，不分彼此。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭必勝，衹要東亞兄弟永遠緊握其不屈服於敵人之前的拳頭，予打擊者以打擊！</p>
<h3>清算民族的血債</h3>
<p>— 吳</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭三年了！這三年中盟邦日本的陸海空軍，無時無刻不在與英美頑敵苦鬥，其奮勇殺敵，視死如歸的輝煌戰績，直可以驚天地而泣鬼神！而中·滿·泰·緬·印·菲各國，有的儘量貢獻物資，增强軍需生產，有的組機國民義勇軍，躬赴前綫，協力作戰！此種一心一德，羣策羣力的堅强陣綫，固然是由於大東亞會　共同宣言的精神實踐，而由於東亞諸民族的覺醒，　起自衛，也是不容忽視的事實。憑此一點民族的自覺心，故在大東亞戰爭初期，日本即能發揮神勇嚴力，將英美使略東亞的根據地，一一加以擊潰，更憑此一點民族的自覺心，而東亞被壓迫的各弱小民族，無不認爲大東亞戰爭是擺脫英美枷鎖的惟一機會。是以目前戰爭雖仍在膠着時期，但決戰勝利的基礎，確早已穩固，這是誰也不能否認的。</p>
<p>德富蕯峯　曾經　　：「大東亞戰爭的目的，有三個階段：第一是爲了皇國日本的自衛；第二是爲了東亞諸民族的解放，第三是爲了歡界新秩序的建設。這三個階段，並不是各不相謀的，從平面的看來，是三位一體，從立體的看來，是三階一實。」今年逝世的頭山滿　也曾說過：「過去的長時期內，以英美爲領導的世界，因物質萬能，功利主義，與自私心理的過分發展，以致墮落爲　的世界。現在英美行將沒落，爲刷新世界計，世界人類全體，當拋却自身一巴之利害得失，置身心於無我之境，爲別人而盡力，互相親切地競爭別進，使地球處處成爲萬民之樂士。」兩翁均以商年碩德，發而爲名言　論，可知此次大東亞戰爭，乃是一「名正言順」戰爭，乃是關於整個東亞民族生死存亡的戰爭，凡　　氣之倫，俱應堅定信念，誓死殺敵，這是毋待曉曉的。</p>
<p>如果再從英美侵略東亞的歷史來看，我東亞各國，除日本外，則印度於一八五八年亡於英，緬甸亦於一八八六年亡於英，菲律賓則於一八九八年美西戰爭後秘改　美國，而我中華民國亦自一八四二年因鴉片戰爭所締結之南京條約後，被英國設定租界行政權，海關行政權，領事裁判權，以至列國亦均　此非法權益，因而我國家主欋遂顯遭侵害；美國復於一八九九年，迫中國承認「門戶開放，機會均等」之原則，一九〇二年則又制定不僅限於美本土，并適用於夏威夷菲律賓等屬地之法律，永遠禁絕中國移民入國。他如伊朗，阿富汗，不丹，尼泊爾，伊拉克，阿拉伯諸國，均爲名雖獨立而寶受英國支配的國家；其餘如馬來，北婆羅洲，錫蘭，亞丁，塞浦洛斯，均爲英國的殖民地。是以在大東亞戰爭未發生前，英美在亞洲的侵略勢力，計在亞洲總面積四千二百萬方公里中，爲英國所分割去的有八百萬方公里，爲美國所分割去的有三十萬方公里，共佔亞洲總面積百分之一九·六。亞洲人口有十一萬一千三百萬，爲英國所奴役的竟佔其中百分之七七·三，爲美國所奴役的亦佔一一·五。而在英國所奴役的人口中，有五分之四是亞洲人，在美國所奴役的人口中，亞洲人竟佔五分之四以上，這是何等的恥辱！況且自英美侵略東亞以來，我東亞諸民族所受政治束縛之苦，經濟剝削之慘，簡直是　髮難數，罄竹難書！幸而在大東亞戰爭爆發後，有賴於日軍的英勇戰績，將英美在東亞根深蒂固的勢力，逐一擊破，使久處壓迫之下的東亞各弱小民族，均從茲解放，而緬，菲，印亦相繼宣吿成立獨立國家，爲我東亞民族史添一光榮燦爛之頁，這是非常值得慶幸的。</p>
<p>不過，從上述情形看起來，我東亞諸民族，在過去數百年間，　可說是英美侵略及壓榨的對象。英國在過去數世紀中，藉其巧取豪奪的狡猾政策，在全世界攫取殖民地，並離間亞洲各國，利用其相互對立，以收漁翁之利。美國則以美西戰爭爲契機，對太平洋及亞洲方面進行侵略，並於第一次世界大戰以後，與英國共　其制覇世界的野心。而英美平素所倡導的國際正義及世界和平的種種妙論，完全在助長東亞各國的分裂與抗爭，以便永遠繼續政治上的侵略，經濟上的榨取，更以敎育文化等美名使各民族喪失民族的自覺心及自信心，俾其互相衝突，互相砍殺，以達成其希望，以維持其優越地位。因此，東亞各國家各民族，雖曾個別的不斷起義反抗英美的侵略，但以缺乏團結力量，或遭英美的武力彈壓，或遭英美的離間分化，無不先後失敗。在大東亞戰爭爆發前數年，英美企岡東亞奴隸化的野心，愈形露骨，愈形毒辣，最主要的從事阻礙中日兩國國交，促成中日事變，以後更就中阻梗事變的解決，一直到現在，重慶依然不變依存英美的政策，就是深中英美的陰險詭計啊！</p>
<p>現在，大東亞戰爭已達決勝階段了，德富蘇峯翁在國民必勝　本中說：「凡吾國民，不可不知此一戰爭，絕無妥協處理之可能。路　有一條，勝，勝，勝到底而已！」此決戰必勝之意義，不僅日太國民應知之，即我東亞名民族亦應加以深切認識！因爲這一次戰爭，是我東亞諸民族向英美淸算數百年血債的機會，祗許勝，不許敗，勝則方爲東亞之主人，敗則永爲英美之奴隸！昔有一印度少女比挪達斯哈便哥爾，因暗殺省畏斯達列賈克遜，被捕處死刑時，曾激昂大呼日：「余恥爲英國之奴隸而生，冀爲獨立之印度人而死！」深信此不僅爲印度一少女之呼聲！而應爲我東亞具有獨立自主精神的全體人類的呼聲！我東亞各國家各民族之全體諸君乎！尚望一致　起，努力奮戰，今日已成有我無敵有敵無我之情勢，決不容有絲毫徘徊瞻顧之餘地矣！</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭與神風精神</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>大廈　騷　三總　的今日，盟邦日本　囊蠶萬，日夜發揮「神風精社」，予敵人以致命的打　。敵　的艦船在神風的　力下，粉葬身海底，　　的人力物力，在神風的怒吼中，消滅大部。</p>
<p>所謂神風精神，乃求　我之必死，以達勝利之必成，而報國恩於萬一。這是一種至大至剛純忠純誠的精神，日本民族魂之所寄，東方精神文明的結晶。</p>
<p>日本的神風精神，由來已久，遠目神武天　御　東征的久未，物部以及其他部族，全都不敢當着這種神風精神，而成爲着國的元動。近如元兵入寇時，日俄戰爭時，也都將這種精神發楊而光大之。但神風精神的空前發揮，要自大東亞戰爭始。大東亞戰爭是據古未有的解放戰，神風精神是戰爭史上未有的犧牲精神，以如此壯烈的精神，配合如此規模的戰爭，當然產生了輝煌的大戰果。攻撃隊，將神風精神發揮到頂點。</p>
<p>第一次是昭和十六年（民國三十年）十二月入日，即大東亞戰爭　發這天的早晨，日本特別攻撃隊，冒險突入敵美珍珠港，向敵美太平洋艦　主力，日夜進行奇襲，而　偉大的戰果。其中以魚雷撃沉美國亞利遜型戰鬥艦一舉，其壯績足垂諸百世千秋。</p>
<p>參加這次特別攻撃隊的勇士，都是日本海軍最優秀的健克，他們的犧牲是志願的，但他們却換着一去誓不復返的決意。我們試看成仁九勇士的遺言，如岩佐真治中校的記住別母親畫中說：「櫻花當落即時落，始不愧爲萬人競賞的大和花」。　山正治少校的絕　：「　　明，期必購，觔弱口　　　　　，就大快　，明月亦朗」。　　淸上士的話：「只要一息尚存，定要忠於天職，　覓面的地方將是靖國神社了」。唯其有此悲壯的決心，故能奠定了大東亞戰爭勝利的序幕。</p>
<p>第二次特別攻撃　在昭和十七年（　　三十一年）五月三十一日，日本海軍在珊瑚海底　，給與西南太平洋的敵海軍以重創後，更以特殊潛永艇，奇挨遙遠的印度洋西方馬太空加斯加鳥的第埃哥·蘇勒士港，向港內的英國戰鬥　及巡　　發射魚雷。同時，又强　澳洲的　　港，擊沈軍艦，使敵人大爲狼狽。是役有潛水　三　艘來還，但這些成仁的勇士，却永遠是人們敬崇的對象了。</p>
<p>第三次特別攻撃隊，就是神風攻擊隊，於今年十月二十五日首决奏功，其轟動世界的程度，較之　國的新武器V一號，有過之無不及。神風隊的隊員，是十九歲至二十四歲的靑年，他們拖着必死報國的誠心，決以肉彈與飛機，向敵　　　，與敵艦同歸於盡，實行其「一機換一艦」的主張。第一次神風攻擊隊的敷島隊，早發基地，　奏凱歌，計擊沈航空母艦及巡洋艦各一艘，擊傷航空母艦一艘。這種閃電式的戰果，非神風勇士無由建立。其後第二次第三次神兵的捷音，接　而來。</p>
<p>同時陸方面的特別攻擊隊也出動，其中如萬朶，富嶽，靖國，八紘諸隊，都發揮了赫赫的戰功。戰果愈大，志願投效的人愈多，大家都顧繼續承先烈遺志，予敵人英美以更大更烈的打擊</p>
<p>日本神風勇士忠勇無比先仆後繼的行動，已使敵人心寒膽顫，世界各國亦　爲觀止。但，神風的精神不僅充溢於前綫，同時也彌漫於後方。後方擔任軍需生產的人們，聞得前綫捷報頻傳，更加奮不顧身地實行飛機增產，前綫勇士發揮的是神風攻擊精神，後方勇士發揮的是神風生產精神，兩者合而爲一，就發生永久偉大的精神。</p>
<p>盟邦日本在此大東亞戰爭時代，發揮空前未　　　　　　，　　頸日　　「真生共死」　綢圈如何？我們已　具日本　繪同盟條約，已對英美寬戰，並已參加大東來宣言，凡口　上所說者，　已　還，，凡紙面上所可寫者，都已寫通，可是　　　　　　　裏呢？我們不要說是沒有神風的必死濺紳，還敢死的精神也沒有，不要說是沒有鍛死的精神，就是連滅私奉公的精神也沒有，協力大東亞戰爭的口號高唱入雲，究竟於事何補？</p>
<p>神風精精，原是東方精神文明的結晶，日本有之，中國何以無之？我想中國不是沒有，因過去外受英美的毒化，內甘自身的墮落而致埋沒消失了。我們要怎樣喚起我們自己的神風精神，俾與盟邦的神風合流，而產生推進戰爭的真正力量？我覺得我們必須從今日起，努力先做到下面的三點：</p>
<p>一·堅定必勝的意志。敵人英美現已成强弩之末，憑藉其剩餘的物力人力，作最後的掙扎，但無論在太平洋上或大陸戰綫，都慘遭敗挫，乃企圖以Ｂ二九型飛機及宣傳工具，擾亂人心，結果必歸徒勞。我們必須洞燭敵人的奸謀，而堅牢必勝的信念，使戰爭迅速推進，勝利早日實現。</p>
<p>二·努力本位工作。我們的軍隊尚未直接參加戰事，但必有參加的一日，而我們的本位工作，却能直接簡接貢獻於戰力，參戰國的軍隊未上戰塲時，參戰國的國民，應該加倍努力，以物資以人力　獻於戰事。物資唯恐不　，力量唯恐不及。</p>
<p>三發揚忠烈的精神。大東亞戰爭是道義的戰爭，日本全國，同仇敵愾，一億一心，正在奮勇作戰。我國今後亦應掃除頹風，發揮忠義節烈的精神，與盟邦並駕齊驅，尤其希望重慶政權下的人民，覺悟拖戰之非，相率來歸，共同參加道義的戰爭。</p>
<p>我們雖不能立刻做到神風勇士，但我們假使能做到上述的三點，則至少已受了神風的感召，我們應該努力進取，勿目暴自棄·孟子曰：「求則得之，捨則失之。」戰局已臨最後，若不奮力，等待何時？</p>

<h3>質對量，精神對物質</h3>
<p>— 陳伯雄</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭自爆發迄今，已屈三足年劈頭第一聲之真珠　龍聲，一舉轟沈美戰艦五艘，其他艦　二十艘，撃毀飛機五百架。戰前敵美大言不慚，用以威嚇日本之太平洋艦緻，遂吿潰滅。繼之以馬來海戰，炸毀英東洋艦隊主力誇稱不沈呀艦之「威爾斯親王」號，並撃沈其高速戰艦「力迫而嘶」號各一艘，使英艦隊消聲匿跡，不敢正視者有年。此兩戰役，　已奠定必勝之初基。嗣後隨日陸海空軍之閃電進攻，迭陷香港，菲列濱，星加坡，印，緬諸險要，席捲太平洋中其他各島嶼及根據地，在短短之一年有半期內，究成堅如鐵壁之廣泛防禦陣綫，其克敵致果之神速，打破歷來戰爭之紀錄。如香港之陷落，不及兼旬；馬來半島之攻克，不出一月；星島敵守將之無條件降服，則僅七日。日軍非超人，何進軍之速耶？曰，此非他，正如兵法所云★用兵在」鼓作氣，先發制人；又曰，兵不在多而在精，此正日軍之善於用兵，重質不重量，重精神而不偏重物質之明證。美英經此諸重創與敎訓，逐積極凖備，多方補充，以求一逞。至去年八月，由擔任太平洋對日作戰之美軍開始反攻，迭經苦戰，　險登陸，結果雖占領若千島嶼與基地，但代價奇重，得不償失。敵方初意，自恃其物資之豐富，深入盲進，犧牲大量人力與軍備，占領塞班等鳥，同時出動空軍，空戰北九州等地，妄冀以神經戰，消滅日本軍民之戰意；及見此策不售，遂又策動其機動部隊，圖襲臺菲，結果兵力喪失過半，一部份兵力雖在菲島雷伊泰灣登陸然血戰迄今，來有進展，而喪兵折將，機毀艦沈者，已不計其數。吾人檢討戰局至此，已不雖判斷勝利之誰　矣。</p>
<p>夫現代戰爭之推進，乃以全民族爲後盾，前綫將兵，後方民衆，合爲一體，在政府指導之下、各就其本位而工作。筆者意見，戰爭之勝敗，除三大要素－天時。地利·人和以及共他物質條件外，其最關重要者，　爲贊方民族性能之優劣與高下。茲姑就此點。以伸如下。</p>
<p>戰爭乃以人力及物力爲其基本工具，二者雖相並而行，缺一不可，然比較上人力尤屬主要，而物力次之。因物力須憑人力爲之操縱與運用，方能發揮其效用。人力方面。又分「質」與「量」兩部份，茲且就「質」的方面以判雙方優勝劣敗之趨勢。</p>
<p>日本人民之民族性，忠勇堅毅，克苦耐勞，每屆戰爭，允能發揮其獨特之天性，證睹日俄戰爭，已可見其端倪。在此次大東亞戰爭中，更見其精彩四濃，炳彪千秋，而日本軍人，則更獨攪勝塲，冠絕　輩，爲世人所樂道，反觀英美軍人之驕慢自滿，養尊處優，佉强欺弱，私慾橫流者，其相差誠不可以道里計。試觀自阿滋島一役起，直至塞班·迭尼安，大宮諸島血戰止，日軍守備部隊，無一不於寡兵奮戰之餘，全體將兵，僚慨赴談，以身殉國。此種忠勇壯烈之戰死，在昔雖曾有之，但殉難者多屬守土將吏，而求諸近代史中，此例更不多觀。况目塞班戰報發表後，舉世震驚，恩仇同羨，蓋以其表現於世人眼前者，決非偶發事件，而爲民族性之必然的表露·由此可以推知，此後雖寸土尺地，亦非守至最後一人不止，非若西方人士所謂戰至最後彈方休也。即此一點，已足奪敵魄，寒敵膽而有餘。先聲奪人，其影響於未來戰局之發展，實至深且鉅。不但此也，日軍於善守之外，亦復善攻，試　真珠灣一役，有所謂「九軍神」肉彈之建勛，印緬戰綫日空軍中佐加　建夫壯烈之殊職，以及最近菲島血戰中，神風特攻隊特別攻撃隊等之衝鋒陷陣，一機對一　，肉體對鐵甲之偉舉，曾見疊出，收獲莫大之戰果。</p>
<p>反觀敵方，前有香港菲星諸役所表現「怕死不經打」之精神，最近復有高空盲炸徒害無辜之美機之來襲，又證以各島登陸之戰績，遷延復遷延，，　充復補充，速決無望，反呈膠着，包圍失敗，反被包圍，形形色色，徒資笑柄。足見徒恃量豐，不足補質之短；質勝量易量制質難；勝負之判，不待智者已明矣。</p>

<h3>The Key to Victory in the Greater East Asia War Lies in the Efforts of the Home Front to Increase Production: Prime Minister Koiso's Broadcast Speech on the Third Anniversary</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - As the decisive battle of the Pacific war, the Battle of Leyte, is raging, it also coincides with the deeply significant third anniversary of the Imperial Rescript. Prime Minister Koiso reverently received the Imperial Rescript at 6:30 a.m. and then delivered a broadcast speech, explaining that the opportunity to crush the enemy's ambition to retake the Philippines is maturing. The key to victory lies in the home front's production base supplying the war effort. He called on the nation of one hundred million to rise up and embody His Majesty the Emperor's sacred will with utmost sincerity and the conviction of victory. The following is a record of the broadcast speech:</p>
<p>East Asian Construction</p>
<p>Three years ago, on December 8th, when we received the news of the Japanese military's large-scale air raid on Pearl Harbor, we also received the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States. At that moment, the spirit of Japan's one hundred million people was stirred, which is hard to describe in words. Today, this kind of emotion has been revived in our hearts, making us more solemnly grasp the determination to complete the holy war. As we look back over the past three years, the path of Japan's war effort unfolding with great glory, we deeply feel the immense and boundless significance of the Greater East Asia War. Today, the newly emerging Philippines and Burma in East Asia have broken free from the oppression and control of Britain and the United States and proudly raised the banner of independence. Furthermore, the people of the East Indian islands are also filled with bright hope for the completion of their independence in the near future. As for the British and American concessions in East Asia, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, they have also been cleared, and the extraterritorial rights that symbolized the contempt of East Asians have also been swept away. The Republic of China, with its great history and glorious traditions, has embarked on the path of autonomy and independence. After restoring its original East Asian form, Thailand has swept away the strong colors of Britain and the United States from the past. Thus, a new world of righteousness is increasingly entering the path of construction in East Asia today. The noble Eastern spirit and culture are also being revived day by day. The good Eastern peoples were deceived by the sweet words and hypocrisy of Britain and the United States, who harbored ambitions to dominate the Orient, which led to the plunder of their spiritual and material wealth and even the independence of their nations for a long time. The Greater East Asia War is to enable these Eastern peoples to recognize the true face of the enemy, while also awakening the spirit of the East Asian nations to rise up and overcome their difficult fate, and to enable the East Asian nations to cooperate today and resist the powerful aggressors.</p>
<p>Enemy Ambitions</p>
<p>We are now determined not to be deceived by all the sweet words of Britain and the United States. In the past three years of the war, Britain and the United States have spent tens of billions of dollars and sacrificed the lives of millions of people. However, what have they gained from this war? It is simply that they lack clarity in their grand cause. However, it is only natural that they lack a grand cause because they have no reason for war. They are merely trying to extend their power to the East and West Oceans with their vast territory and inexhaustible resources, so as to ensure their national defense security. However, the reason why they cannot but fight, the answer to this question, is very simple. In other words, they have no other purpose than to hold the ambition to dominate the world. But in order to cover up their ugly ambition, they have also made various false explanations. These explanations cannot even be understood by their own people. However, in order to arouse the national enemy's anger, they must make a major propaganda statement that Japan is an aggressor or a challenger, and the cause of the Greater East Asia War is clearly due to this ambition of theirs. In order to achieve their ambitions, they have carried out economic and military challenges, forcing Japan into a position where it must either fight or perish. Therefore, in order to survive and defend itself, Japan had no choice but to rise up to gamble on its survival. As for whether they are an aggressor country, this can only be clarified by the judgment of gods and demons. The United States is indeed the world's number one propaganda country, often exerting its amazing propaganda power, calling a stag a horse. In addition to exaggerating the damage it inflicted on the Japanese army by astronomical numbers, on the other hand, it does not lightly publish its own losses. As a result, the United States completed the war victory anesthetic, paralyzing the tendency to not recognize defeat. At the same time, they are even more unaware of the price they paid for being sacrificed for Roosevelt's ambition. The United States continues to force its citizens to engage in war, and recently, it has repeatedly decided to send air forces to bomb the Japanese mainland, especially Tokyo, fully exerting its inhumane behavior and seeking to engage in a decisive battle in the short term.</p>
<p>Production and Supply</p>
<p>However, the Japanese people, in order to protect the national polity, have the belief that they will fight to the last person, vow never to surrender, and will win. Therefore, it is ridiculous to think that indiscriminate bombing can make the Japanese people tremble. From our point of view, every enemy bomb is not enough to prevent our indomitable efforts. Our task, especially the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, not only causes the sacrifice of innocent lives, but also destroys shrines and lofty historical monuments. Under these circumstances, the Japanese people will surely rise up and take revenge on the United States with their blood. Every time we inspect the situation of the victims of indiscriminate bombing, we increase our anger and raise our spirit of courage. At the same time, the Japanese air defense will never allow the enemy to jump. They have repeatedly attacked, but they can only return in vain. Secondly, both sides are bombing the battlefield centered on Leyte Island day after day, achieving amazing results. Every time we look back at these results, we will increase our belief in victory. Only the decisive battle of Leyte can determine the future of the Pacific war. We should drive the intruding enemy out of the coast. The opportunity to crush the enemy's dream and Philippine ambition is maturing. In order to respond to the do-or-die courage of the soldiers on the front line, our people on the home front should continue to produce and assist the soldiers in combat as much as possible, because the key to victory lies in our home front's production and supply war.</p>
<p>European War Situation</p>
<p>Looking back at the European war situation, in August and September of this year, not to mention the enemy countries, even some neutral countries in Europe believed that Germany was about to be defeated, or changed their attitude, or discussed post-war plans. People all believed that a major change would occur in Europe. The allied country, Germany, is in this difficult situation, and the people under Hitler's leadership are becoming more united. Under the enemy's air raids, they are still striving to increase production and arm the people. Now, they are defending their country's borders against the enemy's large army, which has made the front line fall into a stalemate. On the other hand, in the southern Italian, French, and Belgian countries occupied by Britain and the United States, the people are forced into poverty and hunger. The phenomenon of social and political unrest is increasing all the time, and the international situation in Poland, the Balkans, and other countries is extremely complex. The enemy's British and American troubles and anxieties are also profound. Today, it is difficult to predict when Germany will collapse. Due to Germany's nationwide efforts, the hopeful observations made by the enemy have turned out to be the opposite. The situation in Europe can be said to have significantly improved towards the Axis powers compared to September of this year. We take this opportunity to express our deep respect to the people of our allied country, Germany, for their solid unity and fighting spirit, and we hope that they will continue to fight bravely under the leadership of President Hitler, vow to kill Britain and the United States, and carry out the expected goal.</p>
<h3>One Billion People Rise Up in Unity to Complete the Great Task of Defending East Asia: Chairman Chen's Statement on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Today (the 8th) is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Chen issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back on the past, the war situation has developed favorably day by day, the unity of the East Asian nations has become stronger day by day, and the close cooperation between China and Japan has increased day by day. At this time, Chairman Wang was unable to complete the war and passed away, leaving us forever. Looking forward to the future, we feel an even greater responsibility.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war, the allied country Japan declared that the purpose of this war was to strive for the common survival of the East Asian nations, and the Sino-Japanese Incident also changed from this to a war to defend East Asia. Japan has repeatedly stated that its operations on the mainland are not to be an enemy of China, but to drive out Britain and the United States. Its significance is extremely bright and upright. For this reason, it is necessary to awaken the spirit of all East Asians to fight against the common enemy. For three years, the righteous army has been invincible, which lies in this. Recently, the operations on both the sea and land have achieved brilliant victories, which is by no means accidental. This is indeed something that all East Asian nations deeply feel encouraged and admire.</p>
<p>In January of last year, the National Government, based on the determination to live and die together, resolutely joined the war. Since then, it has actively engaged in the establishment of a wartime system, and has done its best to cooperate with the war. Although Chairman Wang has passed away and left us, his great spirit of saving China and protecting East Asia will always lead us to continue to struggle. In the future, we should still follow the established policy, encourage the military and civilians across the country, not avoid any hardships, strive forward, and strive for the final victory to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Now the war has entered the decisive stage. In order to save their past decline, Britain and the United States will inevitably struggle to the death. The intensity of the future war is certainly to be expected. However, with the strong efforts of the allied land, sea, and air forces, and the superior situation, coupled with the belief in victory throughout the country, and the determination of all East Asian nations to live and die together, we will be able to ensure victory, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>China is now one of the allies and should fulfill its obligation to participate in the war. The urgent task is to consolidate the rear, supply the front, and crush the remaining forces of the enemy, so that they abandon their ambition to invade East Asia again. Promoting peaceful unification, saving Chongqing, making it get rid of the shackles of Britain and the United States, and returning it to its original appearance is another important task. I firmly believe that the compatriots across the country will be able to recognize the seriousness of the situation, rise up together, and go through the difficulties together. At the same time, I firmly believe that the one billion East Asian nations will be able to unite and become an impregnable wall of bronze and iron to defend East Asia, and then create a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has reached its third anniversary today.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, there are naturally many things that can make us excited. However, there seem to be quite a few places that should be reflected on. At the same time, in addition to excitement and reflection, we also need to be more vigilant in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>What are we excited about? The first is military victory. In the Pacific, the enemy America has suffered repeated heavy blows. The enemy American naval and air forces currently invading the Philippines, under the heroic counterattack of the allied forces, have also become the end of their rope. The enemy British army on the border of India and Burma has always been restrained by the allied forces. As for the Chinese mainland, the allied forces are making steady progress, and now they have broken into the territory of Guizhou Province, and Chongqing's situation is becoming more and more precarious. In the political field, under the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the unity of the Greater East Asian countries is becoming more and more consolidated. Burma, the Philippines, and other countries have completed their independence, and Malaysia and other places have also laid the foundation for autonomy. All aspects have progressed very quickly. As for production and construction, the speed at which the allied countries' productive forces, with aircraft production as the center, have increased has shocked the world. The economic construction in other places, especially the southern region, has also developed rapidly. With such a huge force in Greater East Asia, it has full confidence in defeating Britain and the United States. But as has been pointed out earlier, we should also reflect on our excitement. It is undeniable that China, as an important member of Greater East Asia, has more places to reflect on than others. How much strength have we exerted in the war? On the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War last year, the editorial of this newspaper pointed out that we should actively exert the strength of the people across the country to cooperate with Japan. The first is to improve national politics and concentrate the power of the people. The second is to awaken Chongqing's delusion of relying on Britain and the United States. To cooperate with friendly countries for the total liberation of the East Asian nations and thoroughly eliminate the forces of Britain and the United States. Also, on the second anniversary last year, we pointed out that to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, we must make our own country sound. First, the people should have the right to participate in politics so that the people and the government can work together. Second, the people should be stable and willing to be used by the country. Third, the economy should be developed and resources should be developed and utilized as much as possible.</p>
<p>Although we have contributed a lot to the Greater East Asia War in terms of manpower and resources in the past three years, after careful reflection, we have not really done our best. Manpower has obviously not been fully utilized, and resources have obviously not been fully utilized. The current hardship of people's livelihood can be said to have reached its peak. People's livelihood has not yet been stabilized. How can we concentrate the power of the people and awaken the people under the rule of Chongqing? How can we develop economic resources to the fullest extent?</p>
<p>We feel that the reason why people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, manpower has not been fully utilized, and resources have not been fully utilized is that the fact that politics is not as ideal as it should be accounts for a very large part. In the past three years, whether in terms of institutions or personnel, it can be said frankly that our country's politics has progressed too slowly. At the same time, the imperfect personnel measures have resulted in incompetent and even derelict officials in the government. In the opposition, there are many capable people who have not been fully employed by the authorities and have been buried. On the one hand, there are also those who consider themselves to be "wise and protect themselves" and are unwilling to devote themselves to the country, which is also a major obstacle to sound politics.</p>
<p>The closer the war is to the final stage of victory, the more difficult it becomes. We should step up the mobilization of talents and materials to cooperate with the allied countries. I hope that the authorities will improve political affairs as soon as possible, appoint virtuous and capable people, and stabilize people's livelihood as soon as possible, so that the people and the government can truly work together to complete the thorough victory of the Greater East Asia War and the great mission of national independence.</p>
<h3>Unite One Billion People to Complete the Victory of the War: Ambassador Tani Issued a Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, issued the following statement on the 7th:</p>
<p>Three years have passed since our country issued an imperial rescript declaring war on the United States and Britain. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers of our army and navy who, under the Imperial Majesty, have bravely fought in the vast war zone of thousands of miles on land, sea, and air, and to the heroic spirits who died in battle. Looking back over the past three years, the various nations of Greater East Asia have declared that they will support each other, be autonomous and independent, or have risen up and declared war on the enemy America, and are advancing with the Empire to defeat Britain and the United States, complete the Greater East Asia War, and complete the great cause of Greater East Asia construction.</p>
<p>Among them, the Republic of China, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, has vigorously promoted various measures based on the spirit of peace and national construction, with the aim of completing China's autonomy and independence. At the same time, it has abolished unequal treaties with allied countries, especially with Japan, and concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, etc., so that the relations between the two countries can be advanced in a landmark way and jointly advance towards the common enemy. However, the United States and Britain are currently forcibly launching reckless counterattacks. The Greater East Asia War has now entered the stage of a great decisive battle for the rise and fall of Greater East Asia. Especially in China, in order to complete its selfish ambitions, the United States and Britain will turn China into a battlefield and make the Chinese people the victims of blind bombing by American aircraft. On the contrary, the purpose of our military operations has been clarified as entirely to crush the ambitions of the enemy America and Britain. The Chinese people are our friends. If we exclude those who cooperate with America and Britain, even the troops of Chongqing are not our enemies. Such righteous Japanese soldiers and the people in the rear exist in a strict and upright manner. If we can obtain the strong support of one billion people to complete the Greater East Asia War, then the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is certainly in our hands.</p>
<h3>US Fleet and Aircraft Carriers Suffer Crushing Blows</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - After the Taiwan air battle and the Philippine naval battle, the US fleet has been severely damaged. Subsequently, the Japanese army launched successive attacks by the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, resulting in the US fleet and aircraft carrier groups suffering crushing blows, and the recent movements have become passive. Regarding the remaining strength of the American aircraft carriers, Minister Kurihara of the Press Department told reporters: The current situation of the enemy's remaining aircraft carriers cannot be judged by their numbers. Before the Taiwan air battle, the enemy had thirteen or four standard aircraft carriers, nine 10,000-ton converted aircraft carriers, and fifty other merchant ship-rebuilt aircraft carriers in the Pacific. They attempted to attack Taiwan and the Philippines in one fell swoop. In addition, there were some British aircraft carrier groups cruising in the Pacific. Since the Taiwan air battle, the enemy fleet has suffered considerable losses. The remaining forces are about ten ships. In addition, more than half of the auxiliary aircraft carriers have been sunk and destroyed and cannot be used. According to my judgment, the total number of American aircraft carriers has been reduced to less than half.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Greater East Asia War in the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>Minister of Information Kishi's Broadcast Speech Nanjing, 6th (Continued from yesterday) What is the true intention of Britain and the United States in the war? No matter how they publicize it, their war aims do not need to be repeatedly discussed. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the cruelty of the British. It is really worth talking about how they want to deal with our Greater East Asian nations. Although Americans claim to be cultured people, their cruel behavior has been found in the history of the world. It is truly shameless for Americans to boast of being noble people. American people use the remains of Japanese soldiers as toys and drive tanks over Japanese wounded soldiers. People all over the world are very surprised by this move. On the other hand, when the Japanese passed by the remains of American soldiers in the Solomon Islands, they not only did not insult them, but also saluted them. For example, the Burmese Dan military unit erected a monument next to the downed British aircraft to comfort the spirit of the British pilot in heaven. Because from the perspective of the Japanese Bushido creed, those who sacrifice themselves for their country are heroes, and in this situation, there is no distinction between the enemy and us. However, what is the motive behind the American military's desecration of Japanese soldiers' corpses, attacking Japanese hospital ships, and shooting innocent schoolchildren? It is nothing more than their superior bewilderment. Commander Halsey of the Third Fleet of the United States once called the Japanese and East Asians "apes." Americans have been holding the belief that they should dominate the colored races. They have forgotten that when we East Asians were already living in complete houses, their ancestors were still living in caves or primitive huts. When their ancestors used their fingers to grab food, Chinese and Japanese men had already been using bamboo chopsticks. How could they not know these facts? Now they regard the East Asians who are more excellent than themselves as "apes," which is indeed an act of trampling on morality. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Strive for Decisive Victory; The Home Front Works Hard to Increase Production; Eloquent Words from Army Minister Kawamoto</h3>
<p>Major General Kawamoto, Minister of the Japanese Army in Shanghai of the Japanese Dispatch Army to China, delivered a speech on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows:</p>
<p>Invincible Stance</p>
<p>"Today, we happily welcome the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The war situation is entering a period of major transformation. Three years ago today, the Empire could no longer tolerate it, and the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor marked the beginning of the war. The accumulated resentment of many years was vented in one fell swoop. The Japanese army was invincible, and established remarkable war achievements at the beginning of the war. The war situation has been fluctuating since then, especially since the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal in February of last year, until the complete sacrifice of the garrison on Saipan in July of this year. This period was a period of arduous trials for us, and also a period in which we aroused new determination against the Anglo-Americans. During this period, although the strategic stance of daring not to fight, which was established at the beginning of the war, seemed to have undergone changes in form, it remained unshaken. In particular, the alliance work of various friendly nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become increasingly consolidated, and they are advancing towards opening up difficult situations with the firm intention of sharing life and death with our Empire. The belief in victory is becoming increasingly strong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enthusiasm of everyone on the home front in our country echoes the brave fighting of the soldiers on the front lines. As a result of focusing on strengthening war capabilities, we have now grasped the divine opportunity in the overall development of the war situation, creating a major turning point. Now, the time has come to re-emerge after more than a year and a half of dormancy, and challenge the enemy America and Britain in order to strive for final victory.</p>
<p>Continental Operations</p>
<p>The continental operation that began in April of this year with the Henan operation has swept through most of Hunan Province, and is connected to the operation launched from Guangdong in South China, attacking the entire Guangxi Province at the same time, destroying the base clusters of Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, which had been the strongholds of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and completely crushing the enemy's plan to surround and bomb our mainland from the mainland, and the enemy's ambition to use this as a base to invade the Chinese mainland. At the same time, by opening up the north-south communication lines on the continent, we will further pursue and destroy the American bases that are retreating further inland, and establish a strategic mobile posture. Furthermore, we have now inflicted a thorough blow on the war capabilities of the anti-Japanese Chongqing army. With the Japanese army advancing rapidly from Guangxi and penetrating deep into Guizhou Province, the war situation has posed an unprecedentedly great threat to the Chongqing regime, causing major turmoil within it. The developments in mainland China are echoing the war operations, which is a very important aspect. At this time, all compatriots active in mainland China should have a renewed determination and move towards the path of achieving major missions.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle in the Philippines</p>
<p>On the other hand, the war forces intercepted the enemy Pacific forces seeking a quick victory in the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines. With the special attack force as the vanguard, they launched a heroic and fierce battle unprecedented in war history, severely damaging the enemy's forces and completely thwarting their attempts. The offensive war power of this battle line is the result of the desperate efforts of everyone on the home front to increase production. This result is manifested in the achievements and special merits of the aviation corps like gods. However, it goes without saying that the determination of victory is tied to future efforts to increase production. That is, the decisive production on the home front is immediately connected to the decisive battle in Leyte Gulf. The enemy's long-distance bombing of our mainland and key areas on the mainland is gradually increasing, so the home front has also suddenly turned into the front line. After the fourth year of the war, the war situation is becoming increasingly severe, and the urge to determine the final victory is closely linked to the increase in production. We must be aware that we must continue to make desperate efforts under enemy bombing."</p>
<h3>Uphold the Belief in Certain Victory; Thoroughly Annihilate the Enemy; Speech by Minister Izubuchi</h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi of the Japanese Army in Shanghai delivered a speech yesterday: Looking back on December 8th three years ago, it was a decisive time for a completely new departure in East Asian history. Today, on the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the entire war situation is undergoing a major transformation and has reached the decisive stage. The year and a half between Guadalcanal and Saipan was a period of patience and concealment for our side. However, this hardship of the trial was by no means unintentionally imposed on the Japanese people. Our 100 million people can endure hardship and persevere in their belief in certain victory.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Destroy American Military Bases</p>
<p>The outburst of anger from the vigorous Japan as a result of the trial was the great war result of annihilating the American fleet in the waters off Taiwan recently, and also became a great contribution to crushing the enemy in the Philippine area, centering on Leyte Island. The incomparably loyal and brave posture of our special attack force on Leyte Island is nothing more than the crystallization of the struggle of 100 million people, and is only the righteous anger towards the enemy America and Britain. Therefore, the entire war situation, with Leyte Island as the decisive battleground in front, has gradually shown a rapid degree of change. On the other hand, on the continental war front, the large-scale operation launched by the Japanese army from Henan in April of this year has passed through Hunan and Guangxi provinces, and has continued to advance deep into Guizhou province. Moreover, the troops that have started a new offensive from the Vietnam side have already been prepared to join forces with the Japanese army fighting in the Nanning area and on the mainland, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. So far, the Chinese mainland has been completely cut off into two parts by this line of Japanese troops running north and south, sweeping away the enemy's American points in the southwestern region that were invading the Chinese mainland, and at the same time, in order to thoroughly destroy the American bases that have retreated inland and stubbornly plan a comeback, a strategic mobile posture has been established.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Delusions Have Been Shattered</p>
<p>Since the Chongqing regime's incident, it has experienced a great threat that it has never experienced before, and major turmoil is also occurring within the regime. Recently, the Chongqing regime's stance has also undergone subtle changes on both the internal and external fronts. The situation in mainland China will have a major situation presenting along with the war's movements. To compatriots who are active in mainland China, it is hoped that today you will renew your own understanding and determination, and strive to complete the major tasks you are shouldering. Those involved in the United States and Britain have also recently declared that "the war against Japan can by no means be concluded in a day or two." The enemy's delusions of boasting of defeating Japan with a quick victory have been shattered, and they have had to decide to prepare for a long-term war.</p>
<p>However, the enemy still relies on its material quantities, and is forcibly attacking in the Pacific region, centering on the Philippines, and at the same time is placing B29 long-range bombing battles on the main island of Japan and the mainland China's areas along the mainland, saying that in order to prevent our country's increased production and disrupt the country, we must further resolve to thoroughly attack them to prevent them from rising again. The real war is in the future, but the one who decides the final victory is connected to the increase in decisive battle production on the home front, whether it can be strongly conducted until the very end.</p>
<p>The enemy also knows this point deeply, so they are bombing our main island in an attempt to prevent our increased production. From now on, it is of course impossible not to know that the territory and the areas along the territory are in fact becoming the front lines. The strengthening decisive battle production on the home front must be carried out desperately under enemy bombing. Not a single one of the 100 million people must have the awareness of a special attack team member.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Closely Cooperates to Complete Operational Objectives; Speech by Commander Kondo</h3>
<p>Commander Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China delivered a speech on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: "Today, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, looking back on the past three years of the Japanese army's heroic battles and thinking about future responsibilities, I sincerely feel a myriad of emotions. Under the Emperor's prestige, the great achievements of destroying the Anglo-Americans are progressing daily. The Greater East Asia countries are also moving towards the path of construction, establishing their foundations. However, the Anglo-American ambitions are constantly strengthening their counter-offensive. At present, with the Philippine area as the center, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States is becoming increasingly intense. At this time, the fleet in the China area is closely cooperating with the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, carrying out the Emperor's instructions, and advancing to complete the operational objectives. According to the past year's war situation, the strategic position of China in the war has become more and more important. The future attempts of the enemy Anglo-Americans and the movements of Chongqing should also be given close attention.</p>
<p>The Chinese land and sea armies are carrying out a preemptive strategy on the mainland, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy's offensive. However, in the future situation, there will be no room for even a minute of complacency. All our officers and soldiers, inspired by the gracious imperial rescript, vow to complete the operation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the implementation of our new policy in mainland China and the progress of Sino-Japanese cooperative construction are breaking through various difficulties and being innovated and enriched with the determination to live and die together. The wills of Mr. Sun Wen and Mr. Wang must be carried out to the end in order to achieve the eternal welfare of the Chinese and Japanese nations. Finally, I would like to express my deep condolences to the fallen soldiers of China and Japan, and express my gratitude to the people of the allied countries for their friendship and assistance."</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Wu Exhorts Citizens to Cooperate in the War; Secretary-General Wu Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Today is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government delivered the following speech: "It has been three years since our ally Japan launched the Greater East Asia War. In these three years, the allied land, sea, and air forces have been invincible, crushing the Anglo-American forces that occupied East Asia. Recently, great results have been harvested in Taiwan and the Philippines, and we have truly entered the decisive stage. Recalling the beginning of the war, our central government issued a statement to share the joys and sorrows with Japan, and went on to declare war on the Anglo-Americans. With the determination to die together, we seek to realize co-prosperity. The war has progressed smoothly because of the close cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. Other East Asian nations also recognize this war as a revolutionary struggle to win the liberation of the entire East Asian nation, and they have risen up together, taking the same action, sharing the hardships and working hard to eliminate the remaining forces of the Anglo-Americans and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. The achievements of the past three years have been more than ideal. Because we have been able to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as we step into the fourth year, in addition to paying our highest respect to the great achievements of our ally Japan over the past three years, we should deeply realize that the closer the victory of the war approaches, the more we should endure all hardships and overcome all difficulties. Only by adhering to the instructions of Chairman, following the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, and making the greatest effort, can we welcome the coming of light. All my citizens, please encourage each other."</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Air Defense Day Drill: Air Defense Combat</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, the 9th, is the 12th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will conduct various air defense drills as usual. The timing of the alarm drills has been set and published in the newspapers on the 4th. However, in issuing the training alarms, if there is a situation that requires issuing a real alarm, the following measures will be taken: (1) If a real alert alarm situation occurs during the training alarm issuance, no further training alarms will be issued; instead, the real alarm will take precedence. If the training alert alarm issuance exceeds the prescribed time, it will be considered that a real alarm state has been entered. (2) Even if the training alarm has reached the release time, if the air defense situation has not yet ended, the training release alarm will not be issued. (3) If a real air raid alarm situation occurs during the training air raid alarm issuance, no further training air raid alarms will be sounded. In other words, if the training air raid alarm issuance exceeds the prescribed time, it will be considered a real air raid alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Simulated Enemy Aircraft Air Defense Combat</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly implement evacuation drills, during the first training air raid alarm from a certain time to 9:15 AM tomorrow, simulated enemy aircraft will take off and fly over the area, conducting intense air defense combat. Citizens should quickly seek shelter from harm. Police officers and Baojia air defense personnel should further guide citizens to implement evacuation. Streets and lanes should be deserted in order to ensure proficiency. At this time, when the air defense observation posts detect simulated enemy aircraft approaching, they should quickly notify the liaison teams to report to the entire area and implement evacuation drills.</p>
<p>Citizens Must Participate in Training</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to ensure that citizens are proficient in various necessary measures, it is stipulated that when various comprehensive key drills are carried out in various areas, all citizens at the training locations must participate and assist Baojia air defense personnel in implementing rescue, firefighting, bomb disposal, evacuation, and other air defense work. They must absolutely not stand idly by, let alone applaud and cheer. Among them, emergency rescue work requires personnel and technology. Whether it is home air defense or group air defense, it is necessary to prepare a full set of equipment and select qualified personnel to take charge. On this day, Huangpu, Old Zha, and other districts will conduct large-scale rescue drills. In short, citizens must conscientiously implement various air defense drills, as well as traffic control and light control, and must not evade or neglect them.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Cotton Cloth Rationing: 700,000 Bolts Issued</h3>
<p>The first phase of temporary cotton cloth rationing in the Shanghai Special Municipal District ended on November 30th. According to news from the Cotton Cloth Industry Wholesale Joint Operations Office, 3.45 million ration certificates were issued for this city-wide rationing, and 700,000 bolts of cotton cloth were sold. As for the second phase of cotton cloth rationing, it is still under review by the Commercial and Trade Committee for transfer to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is on the Verge of Collapse: The Road to Certain Victory is Open: Remarks by Naval Attaché Zhenhai</h3>
<p>As the decisive battle in the Philippines unfolds, and as we welcome the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we are filled with infinite emotion. Looking back on the achievements of the past three years, our army and navy have carried out incomparably magnificent operations. Now, with absolute confidence in victory, we are closely connected with our allied nations in order to accomplish the goals of the Holy War.</p>
<p>The enemy has occupied Saipan Island, broken into Leyte Island, and repeatedly launched air raids on our homeland. However, viewed from the overall trend of the war situation, we are maintaining an absolutely invincible posture. We have established brilliant results on the Chinese mainland and are gradually moving towards the path of annihilating the arrogant enemy. To this day, the enemy's ships, aircraft, and personnel have suffered enormous sacrifices. Furthermore, in the recent operations in the Philippines, they have suffered a huge blow. The enemy is now nearing the point of collapse, and we deeply feel that the path to our army's certain victory is even more open, and the conviction to realize the ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is even more profound.</p>
<p>At this time of decisive battle, the Chinese side's fleet and army, working closely together, are also shouldering one wing of the Pacific decisive battle, bravely moving forward, in order to break through difficulties, complete important missions, and further realize the prosperity of East Asia, pouring in the efforts of a lion's advance, and with the allied German nation, breaking through unprecedentedly difficult situations in history, daringly aiming for final victory, and striving hard.</p>
<p>The enemy, Britain and the United States, often boast of the collapse of Japan and Germany, and recently exaggerated the war results of the anti-Axis forces, but in reality, they are using this to cover up their defeats.</p>
<p>As we enter the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War, we must thoroughly annihilate the arrogant enemies, Britain and the United States, in order to realize the eternal ideals of the 1 billion people of East Asia and the nations of our European allies.</p>
<h3>Reader Aid to Education News: Special Solicitations Come in an Endless Stream: Achieving the Goal Still Requires Collective Effort: The Enthusiasm of Cambridge Seniors and Tailai Team is Commendable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Cambridge Seniors Team and Tailai each agreed to form a special solicitation team, each donating 40,000 yuan, for which we are deeply grateful. We have long heard of the Cambridge Seniors. The seniors are very enthusiastic about active public welfare, especially in cultivating talent and helping talent, possessing unique insight and courage. In addition to forming their own team, they also agreed to solicit widely. Mr. Luo Hongyi, chairman of Tailai Bank, is eager to help others and is fully committed to social welfare. He has donated large sums to this newspaper's education fund in previous years, benefiting poor students, and his lofty righteousness is admirable. We firmly believe that the wealthy people of Shanghai will definitely not lag behind. We respectfully ask them to initiate a kind thought, record the name of the special education fund solicitation team under the "purpose" section of their checkbook, and subtract an extremely small fraction from their deposits. They will certainly not begrudge this small amount. However, if we obtain this one kind thought, we can accumulate little by little. More than 4,000 excellent poor primary school students will not suffer the pain of being lost. It all depends on your "one kind thought"!</p>

<p>Greater East Asia War Third Anniversary Special Edition No. 1</p>
<h3>A Review and Outlook on the Continental Front: Commander of the Chinese Fleet Reporting Department, Keizo Matsushima</h3>
<p>On the continental front, we joyfully celebrate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Under the brilliant war results, we are able to move towards the construction of Greater East Asia, and we feel unparalleled glory. The mission of the Chinese Fleet is to assist the army units in China, to complete the objectives of the Greater East Asia War with land, sea, and air operations, and at the same time to promote the necessary policies. The main tasks are to blockade the 2,850 nautical miles of the Chinese coast, suppress the enemy's sabotage of commerce, ensure the transportation lines of the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and other river basins, and assist the army in annihilating the Chongqing army and eradicating British and American instigation. In this Greater East Asia War, if the Pacific is the surface, then the Chinese coastline is like the lining.</p>
<p>The Pacific and Continental Issues</p>
<p>Looking back at the war situation of the past year, we can see the connection between the Pacific issue and the continental issue. After Italy surrendered last September, the world situation changed. Since December, the German-Soviet war has taken a sharp turn. On the one hand, the United States, with its rapidly advancing material strength as its background, launched a counteroffensive in the Pacific, which had a complex impact on the Chinese front. Therefore, the British and American annihilation war on the Chinese mainland changed from a static state to a dynamic state. The Chinese battlefield, with the Pacific as its surface and lining, is now unfolding in an extremely important scene on both offensive and defensive routes. Especially because the current situation in China is complex, in terms of political strategy and ideological warfare, it is the hottest scene in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, China is the root of the disease of the Greater East Asia War. Because the source of the disease is worsening day by day, it has become inflamed and spread to most of Asia and the Pacific. All the changes in the world have a sensitive impact on China. From this, we can know the importance of the Chinese front.</p>
<p>Japanese Army and Navy Strike First</p>
<p>Looking back at the past year, although the Chongqing army often called for a counteroffensive, it has always been preempted by the Japanese army and remained in a passive position. Important southwestern towns such as Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning have been successively captured, and the enemy is showing its last struggle. As for the American military's actions, they have gradually taken a more active stance, mainly by having the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and U.S. submarines appearing along the Chinese coast disrupt the Japanese transportation lines. Starting in early July, they began using B-29s to bomb the Japanese mainland. What should be especially noted is that the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Nimitz, and others declared that they wanted to cross the Pacific and land directly on the Chinese mainland. Also, on March 1, Stilwell also claimed that the U.S. Army and the Chongqing army would move on the India-Burma front, secretly intending to invade the mainland by land. Subsequently, U.S. military officers gradually inserted themselves into the Chongqing army. The preparations for Nimitz's offensive are progressing day by day. Compared to the actions of these enemy troops, the Chinese Fleet and the Army, working closely together, have been destroying the Chongqing army and eradicating the enemy's air force and submarine activity. Furthermore, they preemptively defeated Nimitz's offensive, launching the Changde Campaign from November to early December. In mid-April, the elite army went along the Yuehan Line, and the navy also opened up extremely difficult boat routes in the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, and Xiang River areas, taking responsibility for transportation and supply, until August 25, when the Xiang River waterway was opened, fighting with all their might under hot, malarial, and air force activity.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties and Completing the Mission</p>
<p>In early August, they attacked the Leizhou Peninsula, and starting in early September, they began operations along the southeastern coast. In Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places, they assisted the army from the sea and air. On the one hand, they also assisted the army units that went up the Pearl River. The naval units in the South China and Hainan Island areas countered the enemy's air force. Furthermore, they also removed the mines laid by the enemy one by one in order to ensure the waterway. During this time, the activity of enemy ships or sailboats was virtually non-existent under the strict action of the Japanese navy. However, the enemy's Yuan warships responded to the progress of the U.S. military's Pacific counteroffensive operation, and their activity became more frequent day by day. They coordinated with the air force to disrupt the Japanese transportation lines. This fleet, which was ordered to protect the sea, overcame difficult situations and was able to complete its mission. On the one hand, because of the special environment of Hainan Island, bandits still resided there. In addition to sweeping away enemy elements, the Japanese army in the area also shot down enemy aircraft and defended maritime transportation. After the realization of the European Second Front in early June, the U.S. military extended its reach to the Mariana Islands in July, making the war situation on the Chinese side the center of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Ideological Warfare Unfolds More Fiercely</p>
<p>Especially ideological warfare is becoming increasingly fierce and can be called the core of the Greater East Asia War. Every move in the Pacific or European war situation has a subtle impact on the economy, produced by the Chongqing side's political strategy. Japan's new policy towards China can expose this hostile influence. Among them, Shanghai, a microcosm of the world, is even more so. The propaganda conspiracies of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing are extremely profound, nothing more than alienating China and Japan. Their ambition and the depth and breadth of their methods are a disaster for the East Asian people, and we feel pain and anger. Eradicating this root of disaster is the value of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>China Becomes the Final Decisive Battleground</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not difficult to predict that China will become the final decisive battleground for Britain and the United States against Japan in the future, whether in terms of political strategy or military strategy. This trend has recently begun to materialize. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which numbered only 370 aircraft at the beginning of this year, has now increased to 700. Furthermore, the B-29s, using Chengdu as a transit base, often appear on the mainland and in the Pacific from India. Also, the British and American military are busy collecting intelligence and seizing bases in order to land on the mainland. On the one hand, they are accelerating the construction of the Ledo Road, which is supposedly advancing into Burma. On the other hand, they are increasing the supply of weapons to the Chongqing army, providing American-style training, and inserting a large number of cadres. In addition, important American political figures such as Hurley, Nelson, and Harriman have repeatedly visited Chongqing, playing various schemes and doing their best to prevent the Chongqing side from breaking away from the anti-Axis line, or using post-war policies to win over the Chongqing side. From this, we can see how much the British and American world policies value China.</p>
<p>Trends Among the People of Shanghai</p>
<p>As for Shanghai, enemy planes have recently come to attack frequently, mostly as a restraining action when attacking Japan, or as a psychological warfare tactic, without causing any damage. However, they have had some impact on the local morale and the economic world, and we must be vigilant about this in the future. The trends among the Chinese people are often swayed by British and American propaganda. However, today, informed Chinese people are grateful for the righteousness of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps or the Army Special Attack Corps, because they are of the same East Asian race. Patriotic young people who are worried about the future of East Asia are also worth paying attention to. For example, the movement to donate planes to show gratitude for the Japanese war results is very enthusiastic. Not long ago, the Navy Baojia donated dozens of planes.</p>
<p>The Battle of the Philippines is Advantageous to Japan</p>
<p>Now, with the Philippines as the center, the war situation is unfolding favorably for Japan. With the brilliant war results of the past and the completion of the important missions of the future, the Yamato race must exert its highest degree of strength, build a fortress of certain victory, and complete the long-cherished wish of annihilating Britain and the United States. The above is reported to the Holy Emperor, and to repay the souls of the martyrs who died for their country.</p>
<p>At this time, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese Fleet respectfully study the Rescript granted on November 12, are inspired and invigorated, and their morale is increasingly vigorous. They are moving towards the completion of the final goal, and they firmly believe that due to the united cooperation of all allied nations, they will definitely complete the great cause of building world peace and usher in a brilliant and bright future.</p>
<h3>The Expectations of Chongqing Have Been Betrayed</h3>
<p>— Zhang Taihu</p>
<p>Among all the countries in the world, the one that most fervently desired and devoutly prayed for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States was the Chongqing regime. Therefore, on the morning of December 8, 1941, as the curtain rose on the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain, the long-awaited Chongqing regime immediately declared war on Japan and joined the anti-Axis alliance.</p>
<p>Why did Chongqing yearn and pray for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States? Today, surely everyone knows the reason. For the sake of convenience in narration, let me briefly explain the reason. Originally, Chongqing overly believed in Britain and the United States, especially the military strength and abundant resources of the United States, thinking that once Japan went to war with Britain and the United States, the powerful military force of Britain and the United States would immediately defeat the Japanese army, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally. Due to this erroneous belief, Chongqing wholeheartedly yearned and prayed for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Shortly before the outbreak of the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain (the Greater East Asia War), the situation of the Chongqing regime could be said to have been on the verge of collapse. Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, more than four years had passed, and under the fierce attacks of the elite Japanese army, it had suffered repeated defeats, losing vast territories, and falling into a state of extreme poverty, both militarily and economically. The important figures in Chongqing had also lost confidence in repelling the Japanese army and completing the "Resistance and Nation-Building," and they recognized that if things continued in this way, there would be no other way but "decline," and thus they were anxiously seeking a solution. While people in Chongqing were thinking day and night about ways to break out of the predicament and reverse the decline, Japan and the United States began negotiations. Due to the arrogance of the American side, the US-Japan talks were fraught with difficulties, and by August 1941, even outsiders felt that war between Japan and the United States was inevitable. Seeing this situation, the happiest of all was Chongqing. When, on December 8 of that year, the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain finally opened as Chongqing had hoped, according to dispatches from Chongqing at the time, upon receiving the news of Japan going to war with Britain and the United States, everyone in Chongqing was relieved and overjoyed. This was natural, because what Chongqing had prayed for had come true. However, did Chongqing truly achieve the goal it had sought? Did Britain and the United States not betray Chongqing's expectations? Furthermore, after Japan went to war with Britain and the United States, could Chongqing obtain the desired gains?</p>
<p>As the course of the Greater East Asia War over the past three years and the current war situation clearly show, Chongqing's hopes for the war between Japan, the United States, and Britain were completely contrary to its wishes. Not only are the facts contrary to expectations, but also the burden it bears is becoming heavier and heavier, and its position is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing expected that within half a year, or at most a year, after the start of the war, the British and American forces would thoroughly defeat the Japanese army, forcing Japan to surrender unconditionally, so Chongqing could sit and wait to repel the Japanese army and achieve the goal of "Resistance and Nation-Building." Unexpectedly, the actual course of the war was not like this at all, and due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army, Chongqing's predictions finally turned into fantasy. To expect that the British and American forces could completely defeat the Japanese army in just half a year and to harbor great hope was a grave mistake, a point that people in Chongqing themselves admitted and regretted incessantly. Chongqing's expectations for Britain and the United States had turned into bubbles.</p>
<p>After the start of the war, the British and American forces could not immediately defeat the Japanese army, and the Greater East Asia War clearly became a prolonged war. Chongqing was greatly disappointed and plunged into the depths of bitterness and sorrow, because Chongqing instinctively felt that it had to engage in an even more difficult war against Japan than before the start of the Greater East Asia War. This feeling of Chongqing was accurate, and this matter is now being increasingly realized. The best evidence is the shift in the war situation on the Chinese battlefield after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. After the opening of the Greater East Asia War, although the Japanese army devoted all its strength to engaging in fierce battles with the British and American forces on the main front, the war on the Chinese battlefield did not cease. Moreover, not only did it not cease, but also in coordination with the operations against Britain and the United States, it successively launched the Henan Operation, the Hunan Operation, and so on, and to this day has swept through the important areas of Guangxi, and powerful vanguard units have even broken through the border of Guizhou Province, advancing into certain parts of Guizhou Province with the force of a bamboo splitting. While the Japanese army was facing the strong enemy of Britain and the United States and engaging in a fierce war, it was also carrying out such large-scale operations on the Chinese front, which was something Chongqing had never dreamed of at the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Although the Greater East Asia War started as Chongqing had hoped, Chongqing's military burden was not reduced at all, and it was under high pressure from the Japanese army on all fronts, and the difficulty of resisting the war was several times greater than before, and it still suffered repeated defeats. Henan and Hunan were lost one after another, and all the important balances of Guangxi fell, unable to stop the Japanese army attacking inland like a raging tide. Today, Chongqing's prayer for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States, and the joy at hearing the news of the outbreak of the war, have become laughable. Now, Chongqing is hesitating on the path that those who rely on others must take. The mental blow they have suffered due to the failure of their wishes, and the internal anguish arising from the current situation, are more serious and profound than outsiders can imagine.</p>
<p>The position of the Chongqing regime has become more difficult as a result of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The reason why the spiritual and material burden has become heavier is more appropriately attributed to the inevitable result of Chongqing's hasty declaration of war on Japan and automatic participation in the British and American camp due to the opening of the Greater East Asia War, rather than the Japanese army not relaxing its operations on the mainland.</p>
<p>Before the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States recognized Chongqing as a nearly completely independent regime, and to some extent, respected its autonomy, providing spiritual support and supplying military supplies in terms of substance. In short, they only provided direct or indirect assistance, and did not dare to impose any serious pressure. At that time, although they had the desire to make Chongqing win, from the perspective of the United States at that time, Chongqing was after all an outsider, and they had a somewhat detached attitude towards the Sino-Japanese Incident; this is an undeniable fact. In other words, at that time, the United States certainly had the desire for Chongqing to win, but if it lost, the United States would only feel that this was something that could not be helped. However, once the Greater East Asia War began, Japan became the enemy facing Britain and the United States, so when Chongqing joined their camp, Britain and the United States, especially the United States, immediately changed their attitude towards Chongqing. That is to say, they abandoned the attitude of recognizing the independence of the Chongqing regime in the past and respecting its autonomy, and instead adopted the attitude of thoroughly utilizing Chongqing and taking its jurisdiction as a base for fighting against Japan, in order to win the war against Japan. Since the United States used Chongqing for the war against Japan and took its jurisdiction as a base, it naturally gradually imposed heavy pressure on Chongqing militarily and economically. Now, whether militarily or economically, Chongqing is under the control of the major powers. This is something that everyone already knows. In the eyes of the United States, Chongqing's independence and autonomy have completely disappeared. This is of course a phenomenon that Chongqing had not anticipated at all, but it is also an inevitable trend after the realization of the Greater East Asia War that Chongqing had prayed for.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War that Chongqing had devoutly prayed and yearned for has been going on for three full years since its beginning. However, none of the various hopes that Chongqing had for the outbreak and outcome of this war has been realized, and the facts are completely beyond expectations. It would be fine if it was just unexpected that the expectations could not be realized. However, the result of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has made Chongqing's position more chaotic, its burden heavier, and its suffering more profound. At the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, what kind of thoughts will the people of Chongqing have when they look back on the past? "Those who rely on others will surely perish themselves," this sentence speaks the truth. If they can truly realize this, it will be fortunate for Chongqing.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Battles of the China Area Fleet in the Past Year</h3>
<p>The general situation of the battles of the China Area Fleet in the past year has shifted to air warfare due to the increase in the number of US Air Force personnel stationed in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Naturally, our Chinese naval forces have been closely monitoring their movements and actively preparing for the next operation by reorganizing war preparations. Here is an examination of the general situation of the past year as follows:</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River area, during the flood season in March of this year, the enemy released floating mines, and bandits also gradually stirred, in order to coordinate. By April, the enemy bandits who were stirring on the banks of the Yangtze River were engaged in attempts to obstruct traffic on the river, and certain attacks also showed a frequent tendency.</p>
<p>At this time, enemy aircraft's air raids on the Yangtze River area were relatively quiet, and the types of aircraft were mostly P-38, P-40, P-51, etc.</p>
<p>In May, the army units launched the Hunan offensive operation. The enemy's air force attacks became more stubborn. Their attack targets were also concentrated on the military facilities on the river banks, and the destruction of boats and supply lines in transit.</p>
<p>However, due to the close cooperation between our army and navy and the brave attacks in the Hunan offensive operation, the enemy on that side made very weak resistance, and our side gradually completed the expected operational goals.</p>
<p>However, the activities of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing were quite active. Since the end of May, they concentrated their actions on our rear transportation, or material accumulation points, and specialized in repeated night attacks.</p>
<p>However, our leisurely mobile waterway work broke through this obstacle and carried out its mission, and together with the army units' advance into the interior, crushed the remnants' intrusion into the garrison area and the enemy aircraft's guerrilla-style attacks.</p>
<p>On June 5, after the fall of Yingtian, the number of B-24s appearing from the US aircraft stationed in Chongqing suddenly increased, especially the attacks on the Wuhan area became more intense.</p>
<p>In mid-July, the enemy air force concentrated its main force to attack the Xiangjiang River basin, attempting to cut off our supply routes. Due to our brave response, their ambition was completely shattered.</p>
<p>In early August, due to the loss of the important point of Changyang, the enemy hastily interfered with traffic on the Yangtze River and destroyed military facilities. They even attached Hinomaru markings to aircraft and suddenly came to blindly bomb. Completely disregarding international morality, they wanted to use deception to carry out their counterattack. On August 25, our naval forces successfully opened up the difficult Xiangjiang waterway, establishing an immortal feat in the Hunan campaign.</p>
<p>South China Area</p>
<p>In the South China area, since the beginning of this year, enemy submarines have appeared slightly, and maritime bandits have attempted to disrupt security in the southwestern islands and the eastern Zhejiang area. It was detected by us, and the attack intentions of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing were still strong, but due to our strict precautions, since March, their movements have gradually become passive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, enemy submarine appearances were slightly more frequent in May of this year. By June and July, they decreased again. After June, the enemy's air operations gradually became more active. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Kitakyushu, echoing the active offensive of the anti-Axis forces in Europe, or the war situation in the Pacific, and gradually presented a decisive battle situation. However, due to our thorough defense techniques, the enemy aircraft were at a loss and only pretended to raid the Japanese mainland, even engaging in psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to cope with the enemy's stubborn mine warfare, we have thoroughly strengthened mine sweeping to ensure the safety of coastal routes, and when our ships are navigating, each battalion of guards, sweeping teams, and aviation units directly and indirectly complete the duty of escorting, and patrol the routes before and after navigation. Countless ships in danger have been assisted.</p>
<p>Hainan Island Area</p>
<p>Regarding the battle progress in the Hainan Island area, first of all, since mid-April, enemy aircraft have adopted a stubborn air raid tactics using moonlit nights. The situation of their attacks also tended towards the north and south campuses. However, their combat power was quite moderate, mainly B-24s, specializing in attempting to attack ships at anchor.</p>
<p>The communist bandits on the island reorganized their remaining forces and gradually expanded their power to expand their territory. However, since late June, our side took the initiative to launch a suppression campaign to prevent their stirring. In addition, the lack of food and clothing further promoted the enemy's surrender.</p>
<p>Central China Area</p>
<p>The progress of operations in the Central China area inevitably reduced the number of attacks on this island area by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. However, the enemy did not stop their reconnaissance of ships and port facilities. They were bravely attacked by us, and each intrusion was repelled. Since July, their actions have been limited to reconnaissance to the extent of reconnaissance, and they have been panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Since early August, the enemy has attempted to smuggle weapons and supplies to this island from the Leizhou Peninsula and the mainland, but because it was blocked by us and the smuggling sailboats in the vicinity were thoroughly eliminated, it has been quite effective.</p>
<p>In addition, since October, the number of attacks by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has increased again, mainly with P-38 and P-40, attempting to reconnoiter and bomb. Due to our strict precautions, there was no effect, and their attacks were only tactical of a psychological warfare nature.</p>
<h3>First Year Record of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Jin Xing</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8, 1941, Japan's international situation was unfavorable. On the one hand, Britain and the United States intensified their blockade of Japan and adopted the "Far East Active" policy. On the other hand, they made the American ambassador to Japan, Grew, and the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, appear in a pro-Japanese posture, carrying out the so-called "appeasement policy" towards Japan. Japan was also aware of this, and launched a diplomatic offensive against Britain and the United States. Nomura and Kurusu's visit to the United States was certainly aimed at achieving true peace, but the Japanese side had made thorough preparations.</p>
<p>After the start of the German-Soviet War's Operation Typhoon, the German army surrounded Moscow, but due to the severe cold weather, the sharp offensive was changed to a defensive posture of consolidating positions. Britain and the United States took this opportunity to strengthen their pressure on Japan, and the imperial rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States on December 8 was finally issued like lightning.</p>
<p>At 6:00 a.m. on the 8th, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters of the Army and Navy announced: "The imperial army and navy are in a combat state against Britain and the United States in the Western Pacific."</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor Naval Battle</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy suddenly broke through the United States' lifeline—Hawaii. According to the detailed report of the Pearl Harbor battle published by Reuters, the United States Navy on the defense side has been annihilated. The main war results: (1) Battleships 5, armored battleships 2, transport ships 2. (2) battleships 4, cruisers 2, light cruisers 4, destroyers 2. Enemy land and sea air force losses: approximately 5 planes, and over 4 ships. Also, Japanese submarines sank 1 battleship.</p>
<p>The victory at Pearl Harbor opened the first page of the Greater East Asia War history. At 11:00 a.m. on the 8th, Japanese army and navy units in Shanghai entered the public concessions on both sides of the Suzhou River. The weapons of the American marine teams in Beijing, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao were also disarmed on the same day. On the Guangzhou front, the Japanese army also entered the Shamian British Concession on the same day.</p>
<p>Entry into Thailand</p>
<p>Japan's entry into Thailand obtained a base for attacking Malaya from Vietnam. Japan isolated land communications between Malaya and Burma, while also threatening the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>On the 11th, the Thai government announced a defense alliance between Japan and Thailand. The following November 15, it officially declared war on Britain and the United States. In the Greater East Asia War, Japan had the Thai army as an ally.</p>
<p>Malaya Naval Battle</p>
<p>Within three days of the start of the war, the Japanese naval air force captured the main force of the British Far East Fleet off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, sinking the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse, the so-called unsinkable ships. The British and American general staff were greatly shocked, and the people of the two countries were greatly criticized. As a result, they had to reorganize the air and sea forces and combat command system in East Asia and stop the Second Front in Europe.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, in addition to the large-scale attack on Hawaii, the Japanese army also destroyed British and American military bases such as Manila and Singapore, and annihilated their main fleets. Within a week, the United States' route of attack on Japan in the central Pacific was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Occupation of Hong Kong</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army air force in South China attacked the Kowloon Airport. On the evening of the 9th, the army had entered the defense line on the back of Kowloon. On the 12th, it advanced towards Kowloon and eliminated the British army. On the morning of the 14th, it launched a general attack on Hong Kong. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Governor of Hong Kong surrendered unconditionally, and on the 26th, the Japanese army entered Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Philippines Campaign</p>
<p>On December 8, the Japanese army and navy air force suddenly attacked the American airfields and air forces in the Philippines, giving them a fatal blow. On the morning of the 10th, the enemy began to land at Xiaparan on the northwest coast of Luzon Island, but was unable to land. On the 22nd, the Japanese troops landed at Lingayen Bay, north of Manila. From the 24th to the 27th, landings occurred one after another in various places. On New Year's Day, the Japanese army completely occupied Manila. By early May, the Japanese army had taken possession of the entire Philippines.</p>
<p>Borneo Campaign</p>
<p>Borneo is the second largest island in the world. British territory accounts for two-sevenths, and the northern coast is an oil-producing area. On December 16, the Japanese army landed on this island, echoing Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Philippines, and controlled the entire South China Sea. After a month of bloody battles, it completely occupied British Borneo by February 4.</p>
<p>Singapore Campaign</p>
<p>The Japanese army landed on the Malay Peninsula on December 8 and occupied Penang on the 17th. On January 3, it occupied the Kota Bharu air base. On the 23rd, it occupied Ipoh, the world's largest tin-producing area, crossed the Panla Sea, and captured Ipoh. On January 31, Johor Bahru fell. In more than fifty days, the Japanese army advanced 1,100 kilometers with unprecedented speed.</p>
<p>Singapore was a military fortress for British aggression in East Asia. It took a long time and 400 million yuan to finally become the target of the Japanese army. On February 8, it began to attack Singapore. On the 11th, it captured Bukit Timah. On the 14th, street fighting in Singapore began, and it was completely occupied the next day. According to estimates, this battle resulted in the capture of 95,000 British troops and a large number of military supplies. This gave Britain a great shock, and Churchill's cabinet was once in crisis. This is considered to be an extremely glorious victory in the history of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Campaign</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is a major link in the ABCD line. When the Japanese army was conducting good consecutive bombing runs in British Borneo. Large-scale bombing raids were also carried out on various parts of the Dutch East Indies. On January 11, the Japanese army landed at Tarakan on the east coast. On the 25th, it occupied the Balikpapan oilfield area, and on January 27, western Borneo was also pacified.</p>
<p>By mid-March, the entire Dutch Borneo had been occupied.</p>
<p>In addition, on January 26, the Japanese army entered Celebes in the Sunda Islands, posing a major threat to Australia. In late February, the Japanese army occupied southern Sumatra. After the Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese army landed on Java from three sides on March 1. On March 5, Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, was completely pacified, and three days later, the Dutch East Indies Governor and the Allied commander surrendered to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Burma Campaign</p>
<p>In late February 1942, Japanese army units launched a deep attack into Burma, and the navy also decided to eliminate the British fleet in the Bay of Bengal. In early March, Britain suffered heavy losses in the Bay of Bengal. Japanese aircraft also raided Ceylon Island, constantly bombing warships in the port, and sinking cruisers and aircraft carriers one after another. Since then, Japanese special submarines have also been anchored on the western shore of the Indian Ocean, and have achieved considerable war results.</p>
<p>In the land battle in Burma, the Japanese army launched a general attack on Rangoon from March 3 and occupied it completely five days later. Chongqing immediately sent troops to relieve the siege, but before the camp could be established, the British army was retreating in large numbers. On April 29, the Japanese army occupied Lashio, and in early May, it captured Mandalay and entered Cao. The Chongqing heavy team was cut off. On the 4th, the Japanese army entered Longling, and in less than five days, they attacked Tengchong, threatening the safety of Yunnan Province. The Japanese army has poured into the gates of India. The oppressed nations of India are starting to stand up in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Attack on the American Mainland</p>
<p>Maritime traffic on the American Pacific coast also began to be threatened by Japanese submarines during the Greater East Asia War. On December 8, a 100-mile American transport team was attacked. On the 11th, the American authorities reported that an American oil tanker had been attacked. On December 30, the Japanese submarine I-26. On February 24, the Japanese army began shelling American military facilities along the coast of California, achieving significant war results. The entire United States was shocked.</p>
<p>Expedition to the Aleutians</p>
<p>The Aleutian Islands are cold and snowy all year round. Dutch Harbor is the largest naval base in that area. On June 4 and 5, 1942, Japanese aircraft carriers launched a sudden attack on the Dutch Harbor airfield, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Battle of Midway</p>
<p>On June 5, 1942, the Japanese air force began to attack the Midway Island air base. American ships were also discovered in the ocean north of the island, and they were bombed, achieving considerable war results.</p>
<p>Various Battles in the South Pacific</p>
<p>While the battle for the East Indies and Burma was being waged, the Japanese army was advancing into the South Pacific.</p>
<p>On January 24, 1942, the Japanese army landed on New Britain Island and New Ireland Island in eastern New Guinea, controlling the throat of Australia. On March 8, the Japanese army landed in Salamaua and other places on the north coast of New Guinea, and subsequently, the western half of New Guinea and most of the Solomon Islands were occupied. Forming an arc with the East Indies. Britain and the United States suffered repeated losses and were forced to concentrate their fleet in Australia, luring the Japanese army to the Coral Sea to the north. The Japanese army waited for an opportunity, and in early May, the Battle of the Coral Sea took place, with Britain and the United States losing battleships, aircraft carriers, and aircraft.</p>
<p>Three Naval Battles of the Solomon Islands</p>
<p>In order to compete with Japan for control of the southwestern Pacific, their joint fleet attacked the central Solomon Islands on August 7, sending troops to land. In the air battle, the British and American flagships were sunk. On the evening of the 8th, a fierce night battle lasted for half an hour, and sixteen British and American flagships were reported to have been sunk or destroyed.</p>
<p>Second Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands: New American warships appeared one after another, launching a strong attack on Guadalcanal Island. On August 24, the two sides encountered each other in the eastern Pacific of the Solomon Islands. Aircraft from each side bombed the other, and two American aircraft carriers caught fire. In the two months after the second battle, there were occasional conflicts in the Solomon Sea. The enemy aircraft lost more than four times as many as the Japanese.</p>
<p>On October 26, a new American large fleet encountered the Japanese army in the northern ocean of Santa Cruz Island. Two American aircraft carriers, one battleship, one destroyer, and three cruisers were sunk, while the Japanese side suffered minor damage to two aircraft carriers and one cruiser.</p>
<p>On November 12, the Third Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands was triggered: Japanese aircraft attacked American ships in the Sealark Channel. Two American cruisers and nineteen aircraft were sunk. Only three transport ships were burned. On the evening of the same day, the fleets of both sides bombarded each other, resulting in the sinking of eight American cruisers and the heavy damage of six destroyers. The battle continued on the 13th. Both sides suffered damage. On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army successfully landed on Guadalcanal. At night, the fleets of both sides engaged in a fierce battle again in the waters of Savo Island. A Japanese destroyer single-handedly penetrated the enemy's formation for close combat, sinking one American heavy cruiser and destroying three destroyers. Other Japanese ships also engaged in close combat with the American fleet, achieving great war results.</p>
<p>From the first Solomon Sea Battle on August 7 to the third Solomon War on November 14, the dire situation of the three major battles in the South Pacific can be imagined. Japan has already seized control of the Pacific, achieved unprecedented victory, and established an invincible position.</p>
<h3>Record of the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Zi Wan</p>
<p>Before and after the Anglo-American major counteroffensive in the Solomon Islands, the achievements of the Japanese Navy can be described as unprecedented, breaking the Anglo-American's major combat power in East Asia and establishing an invincible foundation in the Pacific. In the first phase, the comprehensive location where the Japanese naval power was brought to bear was the Solomon Islands. Furthermore, in order to completely cut off the connection between the United States and Australia, and the connection between Australia and Hawaii, it was necessary to establish an important supply base in the South.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the inevitable entry into the second phase involved increasing naval bases, securing the Southern Treasure House, and occupying various strongholds to crush the Anglo-American counteroffensive. Looking at the Greater East Asia War in 1943, the Japanese army adopted a "defensive offensive," actively preparing for the military and political forces for continued war, in order to seek victory in the future decisive battle. By 1944, the focus of the American counteroffensive was focused on the Central Pacific, resulting in major battles in the Marshall Islands and Truk Islands, attempting to advance from there and recapture Guam and the Philippines. However, upon closer examination of the strategies and tactics of both sides, the Anglo-American counteroffensive was difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The various battles of the Greater East Asia War in 1943 are described below:</p>
<p>(1) South Pacific Area</p>
<p>Outer Perimeter Operations</p>
<p>After several disastrous defeats in the Solomon Islands campaign, the American side had to change its strategy, implementing the so-called "base hopping," establishing points, strengthening supply lines, and capturing base points. The Japanese side, of course, also made every effort to assist its bases, bombing American transport convoys to weaken their combat power. Therefore, in early 1943, foreign operations in the South Pacific were extremely active.</p>
<p>(1) Battle of Guadalcanal and Buna — On August 7, 1942, the Americans landed on Guadalcanal, and the Japanese army fought alone; the Japanese army in Buna also assumed the task of containment. In early January 1943, the Japanese army achieved its goal and withdrew.</p>
<p>(2) Battle of Rennell Island — On February 30, the Japanese air force carried out a surprise attack on the American fleet off the southeastern coast of Rennell Island in the southern Solomon Islands, with considerable results.</p>
<p>(3) Battle of Isle of France — On February 1, the Japanese air force attacked American maritime forces off the southern end of the island, and engaged in aerial combat, sinking an American cruiser and a destroyer, and shooting down eighty-six aircraft.</p>
<p>(4) Battle of Florida Island — On April 7, large formations of Japanese aircraft launched a major bombing raid on Tulagi Harbor and other locations on Florida Island, sinking an American cruiser, a destroyer, and ten transport ships, and shooting down thirty-seven American aircraft.</p>
<p>(5) Air Battle of Espiritu Santo — On June 5, American aircraft attacked, and were intercepted by the Japanese naval air force, which shot down more than twenty American aircraft.</p>
<p>(6) Air Battle of Nauru Island — On May 13 and early June, Japanese aircraft attacked Nauru Island four times, shooting down a total of one hundred and forty-five American aircraft.</p>
<p>(7) Air Battle off Lunga Point — On June 16, the Japanese naval air force, in large formations, fiercely attacked American transport convoys off Lunga Point, resulting in a major battle in which approximately 53,000 tons of American ships were sunk. On the night of August 13, Japanese naval aircraft launched another strong attack on the same sea area, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>(8) Japanese Air Raids on American Bases — In addition to eliminating American forces in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army also continuously attacked American rear supply bases, especially the attacks on Canton Island, Funafuti, and Penrhyn Island.</p>
<p>Death of Commander Yamamoto</p>
<p>Marshal-Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku was honorably appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet in 1940. During this Greater East Asia War, he assisted the army in occupying various parts of the South Seas, and annihilating the main force of the Anglo-American Pacific Fleet, achieving great meritorious service. In April of this year, while personally going to the front line to command the war, he unfortunately died in action, which is extremely regrettable. His heroic spirit is deeply felt throughout Japan. His position was succeeded by General Koga Mineichi.</p>
<p>Battle for Bases</p>
<p>(1) Battle of Rendova Island — On June 30, strong American forces landed, and the Japanese naval air force bombed them repeatedly for five consecutive days. On August 1, another fierce bombing was carried out, causing significant losses to the American side.</p>
<p>(2) Battle of New Georgia Island — In early July, American forces reappeared on the island and on Roviana Island, and fierce fighting immediately broke out, among which the Battle of Kula Gulf and the American landing on Munda were the most brutal.</p>
<p>(3) Battle of Vella Lavella Island — On the evening of August 14, American warships entered and exited the area, and the Japanese army launched a head-on attack, totaling more than ten times. By the 21st, the results were confirmed to be the sinking or destruction of three American cruisers, eight destroyers, and twelve transport ships. After this, the war continued.</p>
<p>(4) Night Battle off Kolombangara Island — On the night of July 12, the Japanese naval flotilla engaged in a night battle with American cruisers north of the island, and many American ships were sunk. After that, naval and air battles continued in the area. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Aspects of the Inevitable Victory of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qian</p>
<p>(1) Modern warfare is a total competition of politics and economics.</p>
<p>The so-called "politics" refers to domestic and foreign affairs; the so-called "economics" refers to manpower and material resources. The foundation of military victory is built on the two pillars of politics and economics. Therefore, to judge who can achieve final victory in the war, we must not only pay attention to the evolution of the military situation, but also pay attention to whether both sides of the war can ensure that their human resources are not lacking, the supply of material resources is constantly replenished, and whether there is unified domestic politics to support the war, and flexible diplomacy to assist the war.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War began on December 8th three years ago, and what is its future? In these three years, its destiny has already been determined. On this point, we can review it based on the above-mentioned political and economic conditions.</p>
<p>(2) First, let us examine whether the first category of economics in the Greater East Asia War—the content of manpower—has the confidence to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, following Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and India successively joined the war, using the people of the entire East Asia as the backing for the Greater East Asia War; this occupies an overwhelming advantage in manpower, thus establishing the foundation for defeating the British and Americans in manpower.</p>
<p>East Asia has one billion people. This one billion people accounts for the vast majority of the world's population. Using the manpower of one billion people to defend East Asia and resist the few British and Americans who need to take care of both East and West, it is undoubtedly possible to complete its mission.</p>
<p>Mencius once said: "A few cannot resist the many."</p>
<p>Using such a "many" manpower to eliminate a part of the evil forces of the British and American aggression against East Asia, its victory is inevitable.</p>
<p>—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the first reason.</p>
<p>(3) Is the second category of economics in the Greater East Asia War—the quantity of material resources—sufficient to lead to final victory? This also needs to be examined.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that the British and American homelands lack various production resources and need to extract them from their colonies. As for the British and American lifelines that they rely on for production and supply—their colonies—most are scattered on islands in the South Pacific, such as the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, New Guinea, Borneo, and the Philippines... However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, these East Asian territories containing abundant material resources were all transferred from the hands of the British and Americans to the hands of the Japanese army in no time. From then on, the Japanese military cut off the British and American lifeline of material resources.</p>
<p>The British and Americans lost the material resources they relied on to contend for hegemony in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Japan has added the material resources needed to defend East Asia.</p>
<p>As such, one positive and one negative, the material resource difference between the British and Americans and Japan has become increasingly huge. The Greater East Asia War, with this huge supply of material resources, is bound to win.</p>
<p>—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the second reason.</p>
<p>Next, we need to talk about the first category of politics in the Greater East Asia War—the domestic policy issue.</p>
<p>The "domestic policy" issue here does not refer to the domestic policy issues of individual countries, but rather to the internal issue of the unity of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Then, can all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia be on the same front and align their steps?</p>
<p>Iron-like facts are before our eyes—</p>
<p>Japan declared: The Greater East Asia War is a war in which the entire East Asian nation seeks co-prosperity and co-existence, ensuring eternal peace in East Asia; therefore, China vowed to sincerely express "co-existence and co-death," and Manchuria expressed firm cooperation. Subsequently, from Thailand, Burma, the Philippines... to all ethnic groups throughout the East Asian region, the "Greater East Asia Declaration" expressed their enthusiasm for unity and their determination to align their steps. This is tantamount to a giant fist thrown at the British and Americans, this giant fist is telling the British and Americans: All ethnic groups in East Asia are united in sincerity, fighting the British and Americans to the end to seek liberation together.</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: "Heaven's timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony."</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has the superior condition of "human harmony," so what doubt is there about victory?</p>
<p>—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the third reason.</p>
<p>Then what about the second category of politics—the diplomatic situation?</p>
<p>The diplomatic issue after the entire East Asia became a "one-country group" is not a question of how countries within the group should hold their cooperative hands tightly and always adhere to their original intentions, but rather how to obtain powerful allied countries outside the group.</p>
<p>Regarding this, the place we should focus on is the connection between the East Asian Axis and the European Axis.</p>
<p>The connection between the East Asian Axis and the European Axis has always been so strong, which is a brilliant achievement of the Greater East Asia War in diplomacy. We will not discuss how the European Axis is encountering today, but the formation of the European Axis has created a huge pressure on the British and Americans. This is an undeniable fact. This fact has added infinite confidence to the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The British and Americans have been restrained by a large part of their military power under the bombing of the European Axis, even if they still have the ambition to use a part of their power to harass East Asia. Then how small is it in front of the total power of the entire East Asian Axis! "Halsey led the Third Fleet and Spruance led the Fifth Fleet... Since October 10th, operations have been launched in Okinawa... After the battle, the main force of the Third Fleet has been annihilated; next, the American MacArthur invaded Lei Qin Bay via New Guinea, and since October 19th, from the waters of Hao Bay to the waters of the Philippine Sea, through the brave battles of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Force, and the dispatch of the Japanese Combined Fleet, the enemy's elite has been eliminated."</p>
<p>——It can be seen that the Greater East Asia War has not only achieved military victories by establishing a diplomatic alliance, but also has acquired many allies overseas.</p>
<p>—The Greater East Asia War will inevitably win, this is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>(6) The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, having already been fully equipped with all the conditions, the last question is how to gather total strength to use all these superior conditions to strive for final victory.</p>
<p>The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War is not only a matter of the prosperity and decline of Japan alone, but rather a question of whether the entire East Asia decides whether it will be a slave or a master. Understanding this, then except for those who are willing to be slaves, everyone should align their steps, move forward towards the path of light, and contribute everything to the cause of eternal peace in East Asia, with an absolutely sincere heart, be united as "co-existing and co-dying" East Asian brothers, without distinguishing between each other.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is bound to win, as long as the East Asian brothers forever hold their fists that do not yield to the enemy before, and give blow for blow!</p>
<h3>Settling the Blood Debt of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the Greater East Asia War! During these three years, the army, navy, and air force of our allied country Japan have been fighting bitterly with the stubborn British and American enemies at all times. Their glorious achievements of bravely killing the enemy and regarding death as going home can truly shock the heavens and make the ghosts cry! And China, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, India, and the Philippines have either contributed materials as much as possible to enhance military production, or organized national volunteer armies to personally go to the front line to cooperate in combat! This kind of strong front of one heart and one mind, with everyone pooling their wisdom and efforts, is of course due to the spirit and practice of the Greater East Asia Conference's joint declaration, and also due to the awakening of the East Asian peoples and their uprising in self-defense, which is a fact that cannot be ignored. Relying on this point of national self-awareness, Japan was able to exert its divine courage and strength at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War to defeat the bases where the British and Americans were attempting to control East Asia one by one, and it is also relying on this point of national self-awareness that all the oppressed and small ethnic groups in East Asia believe that the Greater East Asia War is the only opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the British and Americans. Therefore, although the war is still in a stalemate, the foundation for a decisive victory has indeed been firmly established, which is something that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Tokutomi Sohō once said: "The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has three stages: first, for the self-defense of the imperial country Japan; second, for the liberation of the East Asian peoples; and third, for the construction of a new world order. These three stages are not mutually exclusive. From a flat perspective, they are three in one; from a three-dimensional perspective, they are three stages in one reality." The late Toyama Mitsuru also said: "In the past long period, the world led by Britain and the United States has degenerated into a world of materialism, utilitarianism, and excessive development of selfish psychology. Now that Britain and the United States are about to decline, in order to refresh the world, the entire human race in the world should abandon the gains and losses of their own immediate interests, place their minds and bodies in a state of selflessness, and strive for others, competing with each other in a friendly manner, so that every place on earth becomes a happy land for all people." Both elders, with their years of wisdom, spoke out as famous words and theories, from which we can know that this Greater East Asia War is a war that is "correct in name and fair in language," and is a war concerning the life and death of the entire East Asian nation. All people with blood and energy should firmly believe, vow to kill the enemy to the death, this is without needing any further explanation.</p>
<p>If we look at the history of British and American aggression against East Asia, then among the East Asian countries, except for Japan, India was lost to Britain in 1858, Burma was also lost to Britain in 1886, and the Philippines was secretly changed to the United States after the Spanish-American War in 1898, and our Republic of China has also been setting up concessions, administrative powers, customs administrative powers, and consular jurisdiction by Britain since the Treaty of Nanjing concluded in 1842 due to the Opium War, so that the powers have also sought these illegal rights, so the national sovereignty of our country has been obviously infringed; The United States again forced China to recognize the principle of "open door, equal opportunity" in 1899, and in 1902, it enacted a law that not only applied to the mainland of the United States, but also to its territories such as Hawaii and the Philippines, permanently banning Chinese immigrants from entering the country. Other countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Iraq, and Arab countries are nominally independent but are actually controlled by Britain; others such as Malaya, North Borneo, Ceylon, Aden, and Cyprus are all British colonies. Therefore, before the Greater East Asia War occurred, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in Asia accounted for 19.6% of the total area of Asia of 42 million square kilometers, of which 8 million square kilometers were divided by Britain and 3 million square kilometers were divided by the United States. The Asian population is 111.3 million, and those enslaved by Britain account for 77.3% of them, and those enslaved by the United States account for 11.5% of them. And among the population enslaved by Britain, four-fifths are Asians, and among the population enslaved by the United States, Asians account for more than four-fifths. What a disgrace this is! Moreover, since the British and Americans invaded East Asia, the suffering of political restraint and the tragedy of economic exploitation suffered by our East Asian nations are simply too numerous to count! Fortunately, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the heroic achievements of the Japanese army, the deeply rooted forces of the British and Americans in East Asia were broken one by one, so that the weak and small nations of East Asia who had been under oppression for a long time have been liberated from now on, and Burma, the Philippines, and India have also successively announced the establishment of independent countries, adding a glorious and splendid page to the history of our East Asian nation, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>However, looking at the above situation, our East Asian nations have been the object of British and American aggression and oppression for hundreds of years. In the past few centuries, Britain has seized colonies all over the world through its cunning policy of cunningly seizing and taking by force, and has alienated the Asian countries, using their mutual opposition to reap the benefits. The United States took the Spanish-American War as an opportunity to carry out aggression in the Pacific and Asia, and after World War I, it shared its ambition to dominate the world with Britain. And the various wonderful theories of international justice and world peace that Britain and the United States usually advocate are completely helping to promote the division and struggle of East Asian countries, in order to continue political aggression and economic exploitation forever, and even to use education and culture and other beautiful names to make the ethnic groups lose their national self-awareness and self-confidence, so that they can conflict with each other and kill each other, in order to achieve their hope and maintain their superior position. Therefore, although the East Asian countries and ethnic groups have individually and continuously revolted against the aggression of the British and Americans, due to the lack of unity and strength, or being suppressed by the British and American military forces, or being alienated and divided by the British and Americans, they have all failed one after another. In the years before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the ambition of the British and Americans to enslave East Asia became more and more undisguised and more and more vicious. The most important thing was to obstruct the national relations between China and Japan and promote the Sino-Japanese Incident, and then to hinder the solution of the Incident, all the way to the present, Chongqing still remains unchanged in its policy of relying on the British and Americans, which is deeply rooted in the sinister trick of the British and Americans!</p>
<p>Now, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Tokutomi Sohō said in National Inevitable Victory: "All our citizens must know that this war has absolutely no possibility of compromise. There is only one road, victory, victory, and victory to the end!" The significance of this decisive battle is not only that the Japanese citizens should know it, but also that the East Asian people should deeply understand it! Because this war is an opportunity for our East Asian nations to settle hundreds of years of blood debt with the British and Americans, only victory is allowed, and defeat is not allowed. Victory means being the master of East Asia, and defeat means being the slave of the British and Americans forever! In the past, an Indian girl, Binoda Das Habenger, was arrested and sentenced to death for assassinating Provincial Wei Stale Jackson. She shouted passionately, "I am ashamed to be born as a slave of England, and I hope to die as an independent Indian!" It is deeply believed that this is not only the call of an Indian girl! It should be the call of all human beings in East Asia who have the spirit of independence and autonomy! All of you, the various countries and ethnic groups of East Asia! I hope that you will all rise up together, strive to fight hard, and today it has become a situation of either you or me, and there is no room for hesitation!</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia War and the Kamikaze Spirit</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Like a collapsing building, a noisy disturbance, and the failures of the Three Kingdoms, today, the allied nation of Japan resembles silkworms consuming mulberry leaves, tirelessly manifesting the "Kamikaze Spirit" to inflict fatal blows upon the enemy. Enemy warships, under the power of the Kamikaze, are utterly destroyed at the bottom of the sea; the enemy's manpower and material resources are largely annihilated in the roar of the Kamikaze.</p>
<p>The so-called Kamikaze spirit is to seek the certainty of our death to achieve the certainty of victory, and to repay the nation's kindness even in the slightest. This is a spirit of utmost greatness, strength, purity, loyalty, and sincerity, the embodiment of the Japanese national soul, and the crystallization of Eastern spiritual civilization.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze spirit of Japan has a long history. Looking back to the era of Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition, the Mononobe clan and other tribes did not dare to stand against this Kamikaze spirit, and it became the driving force for establishing the nation. In more recent times, such as during the Mongol invasions and the Russo-Japanese War, this spirit was also promoted and glorified. However, the unprecedented manifestation of the Kamikaze spirit began with the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a liberation war unprecedented in ancient times, and the Kamikaze spirit is a spirit of sacrifice unprecedented in the history of warfare. With such a heroic spirit combined with such a large-scale war, brilliant results are naturally produced. The special attack squadrons have taken the Kamikaze spirit to its peak.</p>
<p>The first instance was on the morning of December 8th of the Showa 16th year (Republic of China 30th year), the very day the Greater East Asia War broke out, when the Japanese special attack squadron ventured to break into the enemy's Pearl Harbor and launched a surprise attack on the enemy's main Pacific fleet day and night, achieving great results. Among them, the sinking of the American Arizona-class battleship with a torpedo is a glorious deed worthy of remembrance for centuries to come.</p>
<p>The brave warriors who participated in this special attack squadron were all the most outstanding soldiers of the Japanese Navy. Their sacrifice was voluntary, but they were determined never to return. Let us look at the last words of the nine heroic martyrs, such as Lieutenant Commander Iwao Shinji's words written on a painting for his mother: "The cherry blossom should fall when it is time to fall, and only then will it be worthy of being a great Yamato flower admired by all." Major Okuyama Masaji's final poem: "Aim for the target, make sure to buy, weak mouth 觔 (unable to translate), then great joy, the bright moon is also bright." Sergeant Seijo Kiyoshi's words: "As long as there is still breath, I must be loyal to my duty. The place to seek meeting will be the Yasukuni Shrine." Only with such a tragic determination could they lay the foundation for the prelude to the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The second special attack was on May 31st of Showa 17th year (Republic of China 31st year), when the Japanese Navy gave a heavy blow to the enemy's navy in the southwestern Pacific in the Coral Sea, and then used special submarines to sneak into the distant Diego Suarez port in Madagascar, west of the Indian Ocean, to launch torpedoes at the British battleships and cruisers in the port. At the same time, they also attacked the port in Australia, sinking warships and greatly alarming the enemy. Three submarines returned from this mission, but those brave warriors who became martyrs will always be the object of people's respect and admiration.</p>
<p>The third special attack squadron was the Kamikaze attack squadron, which first achieved success on October 25th of this year. Its impact on the world was no less than, and perhaps even greater than, that of Germany's new V-1 weapon. The members of the Kamikaze squadron were young men aged 19 to 24. With their sincere determination to sacrifice themselves for the nation, they decided to use themselves as human bombs along with their planes to crash into enemy ships and die together, fulfilling their slogan of "one plane for one ship." The Shikishima squadron, the first Kamikaze attack squadron, set off from its base early and achieved victory, sinking one aircraft carrier and one cruiser, and damaging one aircraft carrier. Such lightning-fast results could only be achieved by Kamikaze warriors. After that, news of victories by the second and third Kamikaze units continued to arrive.</p>
<p>At the same time, special attack units from the army also went into action, including the Mandara, Fugaku, Yasukuni, and Hakko units, all of which achieved remarkable battle results. The greater the battle results, the more people volunteered to join, all determined to continue the legacy of the fallen heroes and inflict even greater and more fierce blows on the enemy, the Americans and British.</p>
<p>The infinitely loyal and brave, relentless actions of the Japanese Kamikaze warriors have made the enemy tremble with fear, and have amazed the world. However, the Kamikaze spirit not only fills the front lines, but also permeates the rear. The people in the rear who are responsible for military production, hearing the frequent reports of victories from the front lines, are even more determined to increase aircraft production at all costs. The warriors on the front lines are displaying the Kamikaze attack spirit, and the warriors in the rear are displaying the Kamikaze production spirit. The combination of the two creates a permanently great spirit.</p>
<p>During this Greater East Asia War era, the allied nation of Japan is displaying unprecedented... How about the silk circles of "True Life and Death"? We have already... with Japan's... alliance treaty, have already declared war on Britain and the United States, and have already participated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. Everything said on paper has already been done. Everything that can be written on paper has been written down. But... what about...? We shouldn't say that we don't have the Kamikaze spirit of certain death, we don't even have the spirit to dare to die. We shouldn't say that we don't have the spirit of certain death, we don't even have the spirit of selflessness. The slogan of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is sung loudly, but what good does it do?</p>
<p>The Kamikaze spirit is originally the crystallization of Eastern spiritual civilization. Japan has it, why doesn't China have it? I think it's not that China doesn't have it, but it has been buried and lost due to the poisoning by the British and Americans in the past, and due to its own degeneration within. How can we awaken our own Kamikaze spirit, so that it can merge with the Kamikaze spirit of our allies and generate a real force to advance the war? I think we must start from today and strive to achieve the following three points first:</p>
<p>1.  Firmly establish the will to win. The enemy, the British and Americans, are now at the end of their rope, making a last-ditch effort with their remaining material and human resources, but they have suffered disastrous defeats on both the Pacific and mainland battle lines, and are attempting to disrupt people's hearts with B-29 aircraft and propaganda tools. The result will be futile. We must be perceptive of the enemy's conspiracies and firmly believe in victory, so that the war can be advanced quickly and victory can be achieved soon.</p>
<p>2.  Work hard in our respective positions. Our army has not yet directly participated in the war, but there will be a day when it does participate, and our work in our respective positions can directly and indirectly contribute to combat power. When the armies of the participating countries are not on the battlefield, the citizens of the participating countries should double their efforts to contribute to the war with materials and manpower. We fear only that there are not enough materials, and that our strength is not enough.</p>
<p>3.  Promote the spirit of loyalty and martyrdom. The Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness. The entire nation of Japan, united in hatred of the enemy, with one hundred million hearts as one, is fighting bravely. Our country should also eliminate the decadent atmosphere from now on, promote the spirit of loyalty and righteousness, and keep pace with our allies. In particular, we hope that the people under the Chongqing regime will realize the wrongfulness of protracted war and return together to participate in the war of righteousness.</p>
<p>Although we cannot immediately become Kamikaze warriors, if we can achieve the above three points, then we have at least been inspired by the Kamikaze spirit. We should strive for progress, and not give up on ourselves. Mencius said, "Seek and you will find it, abandon and you will lose it." The war situation has reached its final stage. If we don't strive hard, when will we wait?</p>

<h3>Ode to the Kamikaze Warriors</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is roaring,</p>
<p>Mount Fuji is howling,</p>
<p>Our Kamikaze warriors,</p>
<p>Cannot bear the burning passion to serve the country.</p>
<p>They are healthy young men in their twenties,</p>
<p>Saying farewell to their loving mothers and wives,</p>
<p>Holding an iron-like will,</p>
<p>They proudly enter the cockpit.</p>
<p>Before leaving, they smile and say to their comrades,</p>
<p>"Watch my last appearance carefully!"</p>
<p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. Human bombs ride the Kamikaze,</p>
<p>Blowing towards the skies of Leyte,</p>
<p>In the trembling instant of the enemy's American warships,</p>
<p>Relentless sparks descend from the sky,</p>
<p>Boom, the enemy ship turns into ashes at the bottom of the sea,</p>
<p>Long live, the martyrs celebrate their success in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze warriors are our models,</p>
<p>The human bomb heroes are our vanguards,</p>
<p>We offer incense and pray for them,</p>
<p>May a billion people in Greater East Asia turn into Kamikaze!</p>
<h3>Quality versus Quantity, Spirit versus Matter</h3>
<p>— Chen Boxiong</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War, from its outbreak to this day, has passed three full years. The Pearl Harbor raid, the very first thunderous dragon's roar, single-handedly sank five American battleships and twenty other ships, and destroyed five hundred aircraft. Before the war, the boastful Americans used it to intimidate Japan, the Pacific fleet then utterly collapsed. Following this was the naval battle of Malaya, which destroyed the main force of the British Eastern Fleet, the "Prince of Wales," a warship touted as unsinkable, and sank its high-speed battleship, "Repulse," rendering the British fleet silent and invisible, afraid to look directly. These two battles have already laid the initial foundation for certain victory. Subsequently, with the lightning advances of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, they successively captured key locations such as Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, India, and Burma, sweeping across other islands and bases in the Pacific, completing a vast defensive line as solid as iron in a short year and a half. The speed of its victory and fruitfulness has broken all previous war records. For example, the fall of Hong Kong took less than two weeks; the conquest of the Malay Peninsula took less than a month; and the unconditional surrender of the enemy commander of Singapore took only seven days. If the Japanese army is not superhuman, how can its advance be so rapid? It is not anything else, but as the art of war says ★Using troops is about」striking while the iron is hot, preemptive attack; it also says that the number of soldiers is not important, but the quality is. This is clear evidence of the Japanese army's skill in using troops, emphasizing quality over quantity, and emphasizing spirit without overemphasizing material things. After these heavy blows and lessons, the Americans and British actively prepared and replenished in various ways to seek revenge. By last August, the American forces responsible for the Pacific campaign against Japan began a counterattack, fought hard battles, and managed to land, but although they occupied some islands and bases, the cost was extremely high, outweighing the gains. Initially, the enemy relied on its abundant resources, blindly advancing, sacrificing a large amount of manpower and equipment to occupy islands such as Saipan, while simultaneously deploying air force to bomb northern Kyushu and other places, vainly hoping to eliminate the Japanese military and civilians' will to fight through a war of nerves; seeing that this strategy failed, they then mobilized their mobile forces to attack Taiwan and the Philippines, resulting in the loss of more than half of their forces. Although a portion of their forces landed in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, after bloody battles to this day, there has been no progress, and the loss of soldiers and generals, and the destruction of aircraft and ships, is already countless. Examining the war situation to this point, we can already judge who will win.</p>
<p>The progress of modern warfare relies on the entire nation as its backing. Frontline soldiers and civilians in the rear are united as one, working under the guidance of the government, each in their own position. In my opinion, the victory or defeat of a war, in addition to the three major elements – timing, location, and human harmony – and other material conditions, the most important thing is the superiority and inferiority of the national character of the parties involved. Let us examine this point to elaborate as follows.</p>
<p>War relies on manpower and material resources as its basic tools. Although the two go hand in hand and are indispensable, manpower is more important in comparison, while material resources are secondary. This is because material resources must rely on manpower to control and operate them in order to exert their effectiveness. Manpower is further divided into "quality" and "quantity." Let us now judge the trend of superiority and inferiority between the two sides from the aspect of "quality."</p>
<p>The Japanese people's national character is loyal, brave, resilient, and hard-working. At every war, they are able to display their unique nature. The Russo-Japanese War has already shown its signs. In this Greater East Asia War, its brilliance is even more evident, shining through the ages. Japanese soldiers are even more outstanding on the battlefield, surpassing their peers and praised by the world. Conversely, the arrogance and complacency, pampered and privileged lives, the strong bullying the weak, and the rampant selfish desires of the British and American soldiers are differences that cannot be measured. From the Battle of the Aleutian Islands to the bloody battles of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, the Japanese garrison units all fought bravely with fewer soldiers and ultimately sacrificed themselves for their country. Although such loyal and heroic deaths have occurred in the past, those who died were mostly local officials, and such examples are even fewer in modern history. After the release of the Saipan battle report, the world was shocked, both admiring and hating. This is because what was presented to the world was definitely not an accidental event, but an inevitable manifestation of national character. From this, we can infer that even a small piece of land will be defended to the last person, not like the Westerners say, "fight to the last bullet." This one point alone is enough to frighten the enemy and chill their hearts. Seizing the initiative first has a profound and far-reaching impact on the development of future battles. Not only that, but in addition to being good at defense, the Japanese army is also good at offense. Examining the Pearl Harbor raid, there was the meritorious service of the "Nine War Gods" who served as human bombs, the heroic feat of Lieutenant Colonel Kato Tateo of the Japanese Air Force on the India-Burma front, and the recent storming and attacking of the Special Attack Units of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force in the bloody battles of the Philippines, the great feat of one plane against one ship, and the body against armor, which repeatedly produced great results.</p>
<p>Looking at the enemy, there was the "fear of death and unwillingness to fight" spirit displayed in the battles of Hong Kong and the Philippines, and recently there was the attack of the American planes that blindly bombed from high altitude, harming innocent people, and then there was the island landing campaign, which was delayed again and again, replenished again and again, with no hope of a quick victory, instead presenting a stalemate, failed encirclement, and being surrounded, all kinds of things, just making a laughingstock. This shows that relying solely on abundant quantity is not enough to make up for the lack of quality; quality can easily overcome quantity, but quantity is difficult to control quality; the judgment of victory or defeat is already clear to the wise.</p>
<h3>Naochui (Military Music) with Preface</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shaoming</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War, in the blink of an eye, will be three years old. Thunder and lightning sweep, eliminating enemies in the vast ocean. Falling... Yang. Establishing special merits in..., the barbarian children's hearts are broken. The brave soldiers' merits are high, illuminating the radiance of the rising sun. Demonstrating majestic wind throughout the universe. Clearing the world is within sight. Permanently tranquil with belts and grindstones. I respectfully offer the words of Naochui and the sounds of drums. It is a slight offering for a peaceful sea and a clear river.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning sweep the vast ocean, the merits of the sweaty horses shine on history. Millions of barbarian children are all brokenhearted, waves are bloody on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>United in hatred of the enemy, lining up in the military ranks. The ocean-crossing warships attack... Zhang. American rain and European wind blow at will, righteousness flies across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>A thunderous sound on Leyte Island, enemy ships are paid to ashes. Eagles soar across the ocean, drums compete. The Kamikaze squadrons soar through the sky.</p>
<p>Rushing waves and fierce battles for three years. Vowing to kill whales and return in triumph. Waiting to see the light of the rising sun shine brilliantly, auspicious clouds illuminate the long sky.</p>
<h3>Happily Composing This Poem on the Alliance's Continuous Victories in the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Liu Yaoqing</p>
<p>Happiness comes from the sea with countless warships, tens of thousands of miles of banners in a single glance. Countless barbarians lament the defeat in battle, many brave soldiers come from... The green mountains and red trees are old on the battlefield, the brave soldiers are spirited. What can the jumping clowns achieve? Where the victory song is played, special merits are established.</p>
<p>Pointing at the three mountains floating green, wanting to cut off the river with a whip. It is useless to transport Huacan for thousands of miles. How can... light overwhelm a boat? (Enemy American fleets are mostly destroyed by bombs) The rising sun... the sky is red like brocade, the smoke and waves reflect the eye, more emerald than oil. (Barbarians... are called blue-eyed children) Where will the decaying and rotten return? The remaining enemies will not be allowed to leave a single armor.</p>
<h3>Writing Four Poems in the Seven-Character Regular Verse for the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Wu Youren</p>
<p>The Holy One played Lu's Gong, East Asia's light is in sight. Arousing people's hearts with righteousness, the responsibility of the Great relies on the Kamikaze. Charging forward in times of difficulty with a broad mind, determined to kill the enemy with an heroic spirit. Overcoming the crisis for three years, firm determination can determine success.</p>
<p>The moment when the beams collapse and the pillars break is a difficult time. Looking back, Wang Jingwei's bones are not yet cold. Not hesitating to support the mansion alone, he also once worked hard to.... The pioneers have abandoned and left. Those who die later should think of human responsibility and difficulty. Striving for a horn on nine mountains, how dare we steal peace when survival is at stake?</p>
<p>Do not seek after delicate soldiers any longer. The good opportunity to eliminate the enemy is right now. The day when thousands of ships sink into the river, a sound of triumph is reported from Taiwan and the Philippines. Displaying power with the ambition to throw away the pen, daring enemies have the heart to jump around. A mantis trying to stop a cart is truly laughable, let alone an isolated army entering deeply.</p>
<p>Revolving on the battlefield for three years, wisdom and courage are deeply hidden.... Mutual assistance and sincerity illuminate the sun and moon. The noble righteousness of co-prosperity fills the clouds. Bravely defending against the... affects rise and fall. Hating the enemy together without regard for the future. Speaking to us, we should be vigilant. The bright moon has not yet reached its full round.</p>
