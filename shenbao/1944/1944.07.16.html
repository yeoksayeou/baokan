<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>星期評論追念張雲摶先生</p>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>張雲搏先生逝世了！這是很足以震動心弦的消息。我和張先生在公誼與私交上尤其感到莫可名狀的哀悼！</p>
<p>和平區內在野人物中，資望爲大衆所信仰，能挺身而出，爲社會服務，更進一步協助政府參加工作者，以張雲摶先生爲第一任。張先生之毅然出山，由消極而積極，實爲國家社會之幸，今張先生之死，實爲國家社會之損失。我對於張先生之挺身而出，從服務社會以至從政之經過，比較清楚，因略爲追敘如次。</p>
<p>我於民三十一年春從香港回滬以後，第一次追隨雲摶先生服務社會事業，是在上海市貧病救濟協會。他在這個會裏所給社會表現者，是公正與守法，不通融，不苟且。這是最值得從事社會事業者奉爲模範。第二次是在上海市民福利協會，這個會的宗旨爲　力求市民之福利，　宣達市民正當之意旨，　協助當局推行良好政策。都是雲搏先生親自手訂的，出發點完全爲市民謀福利。他在這個會裏所給社會表現者除公正守法之外，辦事認眞，往往爲了一件市民福利工作，不辭奔走，親自調查，猶如自己之事同樣的熱心。</p>
<p>今年一月中旬決定從政，擔任司法行政部長。當政府決定延聘張先生時，他會經過一再的相當考慮，他的挺身而出，原是希望多做有利大衆的工作。政府旣然殷殷有求賢之意，而司法行政直接與民據有利害關係，他毅然決定從政，出發點還是爲大衆服務。當時雖有種種障礙，他以勇氣排除之。所以，他的從政，絕對不是爲做官而做官。因而他的生活，仍保持書生本色。當初答應中樞當局以六個月爲期，最近以約期將屆，會一再提出辭職，他從北京視察司法囘來，會與我談及辭職一事，並非消極隱退，將以更積極的精神，繼續辦理上海市民福利協會的工作，因爲在他離去市民福利協會期內，由我承乏其事，他總是不滿意我所做的市民福利工作太少。但經過當局一再的挽留，才打消辭意。可惜他一病不起，在司法上爲民服務就此終止，面上海市民福利協會也失去領遵了。</p>
<p>我對於雲搏先生的逝世，一時感念交集，無從說起最易發生的感想有三點：</p>
<p>社會事業地方事業，一定需要素孚衆望的老前輩領導，他必須有公正的態度，廉潔的人格，深厚的資望，可惜一般雖具此條件的人物，偏於消極，潔身自好，只顧個人的利害關係。而如張先生不肯坐視社會事業的衰落，主張上海社會必須有中心力量，所以，他就排除一切障礙，挺身出而領導者，這種精神，可使一般消極保守者的深切反省。</p>
<p>張先生擔任司法行政部長雖僅半年，一切改革整理尙未完成他的志願，但是他屢次很公道的表示，前部長羅君強氏對於司法行政是有功績的。我們當初認爲政府起用張先生是賢明的，因此，我們對於今後司法行政部長的繼任人選，尤應特別注意，必須能够繼續張先生的遺志，保持司法行政的尊嚴與信譽，絕對不容許人格不全者濫芋。</p>
<p>張先生平日與盟邦日本人士接觸以後，常常引起背後的好評。這次在病中，海軍及大使館方面都非常關心，派名醫會診。爲什麽這樣令人起敬和關心呢？我認爲第一，他有書生本色的生活和態度，公正廉潔的美德。第二，他是四十年前留日學生，具有解決中日基本問題的誠意與熱情。</p>
<h3 id="c1">華北日使領會議商討各重要施策　决努力增產確保作戰資源 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>北平十五日中央社電　日本駐華大使館北平事務所管下公使館會議，十四日上午九時起，特於公使室舉行。大使館方面到有艦澤公使，土由總務部長，及各部課長。華北日軍方面到有塚本中西兩隊長，又北平·天津·濟南·靑島·石門·太原·開封·張店·唐山·徐州。等各地總領事及領事等，均出席參加。行禮如儀後，首由鑒澤公使就現階段下，對於應付華北局勢應有之決心，有所訓示。繼由塚本部隊長說明治安現狀，嗣由各部長就所管事項，有所報告後，即由全體對決戰下增產增送之具體施策，作種種協議。茲誌其重要者如次：　爲增强戰力起見，應採之特別措置，爲確保華北所出產之作戰資源，以完遂戰爭起見，決將過去之增產增送之目標，分期完成，並實施勞務管理之刷新及强化。同時爲使食糧收買工作順利進行起見，決確保中國勞工，並强行動員日僑學生及工程隊，以積極增產。　與關係各機關協力，爲努力推進以上各項工作起見，自然需要華北日軍之全面協力，同時幷與華北政務委員會共謀合作辦法，尤以勞工問題，特期待王克敏委員長之盡力相助。　華北日僑由於華北所負使命之重大，故四十萬日僑責任亦隨之加重，關於常局今後之重耍施策，決不允許他人作無謂之誹謗與批評，如有正當意見，應直接向當局陳述。總之四十萬日僑，應團結一致，與華北一億民衆相提携，以達到共同之目的。</p>
<p>北平十五日中央社電　華北勞工協會，本年之事務重點，在於向華北各地及東亞共榮圈內各重要產業部門，供給充分之勞工。然因本年華北物價騰高等關係，若按過去之招工方法辦理，頗難獲得所需要之勞力，於是乃在本部設理事室辦公制度，使圓滿辦理勞工事務。同時並指定各辦事處及分處等之責任制，及事業担當組織，亦即使各辦事處及分處，常與責任事業機構繁密連絡，究明各地之勞力需要狀况，即使各地不託辦理募工，在認爲勞工不足，極需補充時，當即供予勞工，藉期各地事業之經營，不受任何妨障。</p>
<h3 id="c2">大東亞各地　一週間戰况 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　大東亞戰域過去一週間各地戰況如次：　中國面，日軍南下部隊，對孤城衡陽，仍在包圍攻擊中，同時並繼續南下。乙。廣東方面，粵省日軍北上部隊，於十一日渡過粵漢　要衝英德南方二十公里之運江，並擊潰渝軍，繼續挺進，該方面日軍，自作戰開始，迄十一日收獲戰果，計收容渝軍屍體一千餘其，俘虜二百八十六名，函穫砲五門及其他輕重機槍並槍支等五百八十一支。（空戰）日空軍機除，於直接協力陸戰之同時，並期澈底粉碎渝美空軍，故連日進攻其芷江，贛州，新城，遂川，梁山，丹竹及桂林等別進基地，收獲光輝戰果，予渝美空軍以莫大打擊。茲誌其戰果主要者如次：計被炸毀或焚燒之渝美機，十日於桂林爲二十八架，十一日於丹竹爲十四架，十二日於芷江爲五十一架，十三日於桂林爲八十九架，合計共一百八十二架。按七月上旬渝美機之來襲，共二百二十四次，累計機數爲一千二百四十五架，但自一日迄十三日，僅日空軍機隊所收戰果，即爲二百七十七架，故渝美機損失甚重。　緬甸方面（陸戰）敵舉爲打通哥希馬通伊姆法爾之公路，故遂次於伊如法爾盆地增强兵力，同時並有企圖奪回烏克魯爾之勢。巴列爾及比先波爾方面之敵，得大砲戰車之援，益來攻擊，但被日軍擊退。茲誌各地陸戰情况如次：甲·北緬方面，日軍對由加曼英方面逐次南下之渝軍新編第一軍及于慕加溫附近進攻之渝車，已强化反攻態勢。乙。密芝那方面，當地日軍正以寡兵隨地反擊美式之渝軍第十四師及新編第三十一師及美軍，並將之擊退。六日，日軍乘渝美軍之虛，突然進擊，對其主要陣地，敢行夜襲，是役計渝美軍　屍百三十八具，被俘七十八人。按自五月十七日渝美軍反攻以來之五十日間，其戰死及負傷者達一萬一千之衆。丙。怒江方面，騰越，芒市，龍陵一帶渝軍第二十一及十一集團軍，已蒙重大損失，其反攻企圖，已被粉碎。（空戰）日軍機隊於七日及九日，冒惡劣之天氣，兩度奇襲密芝那機塲，幷擊落敵機十二架，其停留地上之大型運輪機十六架及P40型機二十三架，全部中彈起火。　中部太平洋方面，於寒班島奪戰中之日陸海軍部隊，遂次整理戰綫，十日夜，據守馬比山附近之一帶洞穴陣地，以白刃突擊敵軍陣地，而展開壯烈之肉搏戰。同時，日空軍爲呼應陸海軍作戰起見，六日夜會轟炸塞班島敵陣及該島東方海面之敵巡洋艦羣及驅逐艦羣，七日夜會轟炸阿斯利特機塲。又敵軍依然向該機塲增加空軍力，十日會發現敵大型運輸機數架及小型機五十架，相繼降陸，而港內亦停有大型船艇二十餘艘。又迭尼安島西北海面亦有敵航空母艦二艘，巡洋艦，驅逐艦三十餘艘，在蠢動中。十日敵機數十架來襲迭尼安島，又敵艦艇亦不分晝夜向該島砲擊，而塞班島之敵砲台亦實行砲擊，同時，日軍於該島之砲台亦不示弱，而予以還擊，六日會發巨彈轟擊阿斯利特機塲。又六日至十三日間，來襲大宮島之敵機，前後共達三百四十架以上（被日方擊落三十三架以上），又九日及十三日敵戰艦巡洋艦及驅逐艦等會砲擊羅特島，雅普島及特魯克島，亦屢遭敵機轟炸。　南太平洋方面，所羅門島方面，拉巴爾，加比恩之拿馬達奈之拉德布方面布加地區及波根維爾島南部之日軍陣地，時有敵機來襲。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日中國派遣軍　駁斥渝方宣傳　日軍絕未用毒瓦斯 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　日軍華中進攻作戰節節進展，渝軍迭遭慘敗，難以掩飾，乃自六月下旬，衡陽日瀕危殆之時起，散放謠言，謂日軍使用毒瓦斯。頃日中國派遣軍特於十五日發表書面談話，否認此舉，謂六月下旬以來，渝方宣傳日軍於湖南戰綫使用毒瓦斯，惟日軍素重道義，非特過去毫無此種行動，即在將來苟渝方不先行使用，則亦不採用此種非人道之戰鬥方式，此蓋渝軍對於日軍此次作戰無計可施，乃出此下策，藉謀略宣傳，掩飾其敗戰耳。與過去宣傳常德會戰時，日軍使用毒瓦斯者，若出一轍，其哀憐態度，實令人可晒。</p>
<p>湘鄕日軍獲得戰果</p>
<p>湘南日軍某基地十五日中央社電　粵漢綫爾寺後，到處掃蕩渝第四軍，其他殘敗渝軍，連日在湘鄉方面反擊，欲奪回該地之渝軍第十五師，激戰結果，除擊斃渝軍二百，俘虜三十四人外，並奪獲迫擊砲一門，輕機關槍多架，日方有戰死者及受傷者二人。又日軍南進部隊，於九日正午在黃陂（衛陽西方十公里）附近，發現渝軍第九十八師約六百人，當即對其攻擊，即將其擊潰。</p>

<p>美機盲炸新鄕車站</p>
<p>北平十五日中央社電　七月十四日下午一時五十五分左右，有美駐渝空軍B一二五型機八架，P四十型機三架，飛至粵漢綫新鄉上空，盲炸居民密集地帶，並襲擊車站，快車中日旅客及附近居民有相當死傷。一般旅客對美機之非人道盲炸，無不深爲痛恨。</p>

<p>廣州十五日中央社電　代替緬旬公路之萊多公路，乃爲渝方之一大生命綫，故重慶及援助重慶之美國技術者，皆盡其最大力量，從事建築。據十四日到達此問之消息，萊多公路之建築，仍在美人技師及渝方勞工活動下，繼續進行，但此實爲一難事，尤如六月之豪雨中，未能稍見進展，同時由於日軍之重壓，故現時該公路完全不能使用。</p>

<p>廣東十五日中央社電　甘地翁前會向回敎聯盟總裁提出回印對立之解決案，要回敎聯盟協力建立新印度政府，而向英政府開始政治攻勢，至本月十三日，並於孟買發表聲明，提倡樹立印度國民政府。余倘不以會議派之運用委員會協議，決不能作任何舉動，余此次提案，與一九四二年英國提出克利浦斯議案時運用委員會所提議案完全不同。余目下認爲關於印度民政應組織以掌握全權之國民政府，人選應由中央立法會議議員中推選組織之，即於戰時下宣言獨立，英督及英國國王立於同樣地位，以責任閣僚輔助之。甘地翁上項聲明中會謂，於戰時下挽回英國退出在印勢力之聲明，要求樹立一完全掌握印度民政之國民政府，採取折衷辦法，以期印度踏上完全獨立大道。實際上甘地此項議案若完全予以承認，則預測他日必將引起下列事態，　英國承認印度獨立，　戰時下英在印度主權只空留其名義，英國仍保留作戰用兵統帥權，其軍事地位尚不及駐渝美軍之權威。　關於動員兵站補給事項，亦須由國民政府閣僚國防部長指揮。　實習獨立之國民政府，顯然趨於反英，以上數項在以印度爲侵略東亞基地之英國必　於忍受。關於甘地之新提案，著名之印度通休斯　，十三日於英文時報中著論，提出反對意見謂，舉全國總力赴戰之國家，將政治，民政，軍事分成三部，乃不可能者，由此可見英國絕不能承認甘地之提議，甘地之價意在一時撤去英國勢力退去之招牌，以甘地之提案使和協之印象瀰漫內外，更使英國少頑固趨於表面化，以資揣大抗英遝動，此實屬對英國之兩大政治攻勢。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　據孟買電，甘地翁十四日發表聲明稱：克里浦斯之印度問題提案，無異欲使印度分裂，故余泱不能接受該案。印度之自由早應實現，克里浦斯之提案若能實施，則印度之自由又將受甚大阻碍，回敎徒聯盟總裁琴那，或不致反對余之提案，但英政府總不願解決印度之獨立問題，一方以琴那爲口實，而不予印度自由，故我等對彈壓印度自由之惡竅，實有淸除之必要。</p>

<p>東京十五日中央社電　此間軍事家頃就駐渝美空軍與渝軍之共同作戰，表明見解，並說明美軍狂呼渝美共同作戰之真相，其大意謂：此次日軍發動大陸作戰後，渝方於對內外宣傳時，力謂河南湖南作戰，對渝方雖屬重要，但有關全局大勢者，厥在空軍機械力之强化，與印緬戰綫之情勢。觀其語意，似認大陸戰綫責任乃在英美，此實即渝方要求美國武器必須絕對協力渝軍作戰之意，並希望擬藉渝美共同作戰，脫出重大危機。美國一面偽裝今後美空軍決不負渝方之期待，一面仍本自己之野望，驅使渝軍對日作戰。中國戰綫之日軍，已奪長沙，更取衡陽機塲，渝方重要空軍基地？不僅相繼爲日軍佔領或覆減，更予美空軍以重大打擊。於此此渝美兩者俱受里創，實際渝方之犧性，實極浩大，而渝軍所以遭此重大犧牲者，一言以敝之，實爲不知美空軍本質故也。駐渝美空軍現橫行於中國大陸，事實上彼等駐淪，乃爲實現美國之醱傲野心所驅使，即彼等傾其主力於空襲日本土，及對日軍後方兵站綫之游繫襲擊，亦無助於渝方。渝軍所期待者，爲對渝野戰軍之協力，其於與日軍戰門機隊之正面作戰，主使脆弱之渝空軍出擊，美空軍則專願襲盤日本本土，此種事實，於新作戰下之各地，隨處可見美軍所喊之渝美共同作戰不，過如此而已。敵美於事實上，絕非協力渝軍作戰，渝軍未能洞悉此情，勢必與美空軍同於火綫上遭日軍之痛聲云。</p>
<p>貴州苗族憤恨美軍</p>

<p>柏林十五日中央社電　海通社訊：英美官方對於於土國之談判，發言審慣。美駐土大使斯坦哈特昨日會晤羅斯福總統後，申言反軸心國行將與土國加緊合作，國務卿赫爾稱，土國屢逢對反戰心增進關係之問題，目前復遇討論該問題之機會矣。柏林負責方面尚未提及反軸心國對土國之耍求，但並非缺乏情報，英美美報紙及通訊社之消息互相矛盾，或謂土國行將參戰，或對德絕交，然後以土國飛機塲及海峽根據地讓與反軸心國。英美報紙申言談判之主動者為蘇聯，然蘇聯保持緘默。就各方觀察，英大使當係最活動者。「每日電訊報」以為蘇聯希望參加英土同盟，柏林消息靈通人士對此頗感懷疑，蓋英蘇兩國對海峽均具野心，斷難推誠相與。「每日簡報」載稱，蘇聯副外交人民委員長維主斯基將於短時期內前往土國參加談判云云，此事亦屬可能，而謠傳維辛斯基巳在土國一事，不攻自破矣。</p>

<p>東綫戰爭又自北至南，如火如茶，愈演愈烈了。因此受最大影響者，莫如巴爾幹。蘇聯紅軍今年夏季攻勢的目標之一，自然包括巴爾幹。但巴爾幹是德國抗戰力的基礎，且對於斷然應付協約國東西南三面作戰，而以「防禦的進攻」爲策略的德國看來，巴爾幹是勢在必守，也可以說，巴爾幹在則德國在，巴爾幹之則德國之。就是由於這種關係，筆者滿耳充滿着北造戰爭激化的喧器，東錢戰事又間的吶喊，而僕僕風鹿，跑向巴爾幹。目的地就是常前傳聞最緊張的屬馬尼亞。自已的旅程，固然還想到保加利亞，洪牙利，克羅地等方面去，但姑且先從羅京布加列斯特報告一下巴爾幹的形勢</p>
<p>盛夏的首都</p>
<p>橫越巴爾幹的途次，曾不止一次地受到協約國飛機的襲擊。當時曾不得不跳出火車，臥倒於田野裏，但結果，並不值得驚恐，同時也並未妨碍了火車的繼續前進，這是使我聲香祈　的。羅京業已是炎熱的盛夏，與近衛隊保守着的洪京布　佩斯相餃，真有天地懸殊的熱度。</p>
<p>自從今年四月四日以來，英美飛機對羅馬尼亞大事轟炸的慘禍，當我晚上一到羅京的瞬間，就痛切地體騐到了。從大街頭上的臨時電車終點，至中內電東塲率站這一相當遠的距離，不能不安步當車，後來就擠到市內客滿的電車上，由於手中只是一個手皮包，方不至於不能成行。因於嚴格的燈火管制，而在黑暗中摸索到的旅館，據說這是羅京最後殘留的一個旅館，但這個唯一的旅館，也曾遭受到第一次的炸毀，而兩三天前剛剛恢復舊視。</p>
<p>德羅同生共死</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞主要是反對蘇聯。所以羅京最担心者，就是蘇聯配合英美在北法海岸登陸，而在東綫幾時開始夏季攻勢這一點上。不幸，紅軍果於六月二十二日，打破長期的沈寂，而發動大攻勢了。目前的戰爭中心，固在中部戰塲，但由喀爾已阡山脈至貝薩拉比亞一帶的紅軍，却在虎視眈眈，躍躍欲試的情形裹。該處的積極大規模攻勢，固然尚未發動，但國境方面成爲驚大地泣鬼神的決戰塲所之日期，想必日益迫近，這是羅國上下人士，全體重視的重心。</p>
<p>雜誌報章，全都淸一色地發表着德國的公報，而在滿篇累讀報導着諾曼第的戰况，這一點雖然足够使羅國人士驚慌，但英美如不直接進攻巴爾幹，則羅馬尼亞仍會全部信賴德國的戰力。該國立塲上的各種意見，不能全部表現出來，而只是被動武的千篇一律入股文章。</p>
<p>德國方面的報紙，則與羅國報紙大相逕庭，並不消極悲觀，而更顯出積極的動向來。例如德文布加列斯日報的社論上一再吶喊：</p>
<p>「羅馬尼亞將來的命運，不僅決定於蘇聯紅軍的進攻，同時也決定於英法峽的決戰。假如英美在西歐登陸成功，羅馬尼亞只有　同德國，走向死亡。」</p>
<p>轟炸之政治性前此布加列斯特本身所受到的轟炸，只有十次，但人口百萬的這個都市，業已疏散出二十萬左右，同時大部主要機關，也早已分散至一百公里外的郊外。外國公使館中尚未疏散者，只有日本和德國。羅國的防空設施，比起德國來，眞是相形見細，，小巫見大巫，所以維馬尼亞人民日常的精神全部，都集中於空裂上，就因爲這一點，英美的恐怖空襲，不僅限於軍事目標；而且包含政洽性目的，從其轟炸方法上看，很可以知消這一點。我自從進入羅馬尼亞國境以來，在尚未到達羅京前的長時期，會看見過無數城鄉及車站被炸後的慘慘景象，同時在火車上　親眼看到普羅耶斯契油田區的防空設施，但該處使我感覺特別者，就是空襲的政治性</p>
<p>最恰當的例證，就是普羅耶斯契的煤油設施，在該處有德羅共同防衛的完整防空組織，當敵方飛機來襲時，就以最萬害的烟幕，佈滿全區，雖然這樣實行恐怖，但受過這樣相同的十次轟炸，而該區區精煉工塲的油庫，仍然然整齊地排列着。</p>
<p>一到了羅京，才知這油田的實際損失，非常的少，反而羅馬的美國廣播說「煉油塲完全炸毀」，這是如何大的謊言。因此，英美對於這種設施，是否能真正滿足蘇聯的要求，而加以澈底炸毀，，這誠屬疑問。</p>
<p>各國對羅態度</p>
<p>按羅京權威記者說：「單純一個布加列斯特城，也有一萬無辜市民的被炸死，在鄉村，甚至勞動中的農民，敎堂，學校等，都遭受到敵機的轟炸。這種人所不齒的行爲，當然目的在擾亂國民的禪經，使其背信脫離德國的同盟。但英美空軍，非常奇怪，對於準備抵抗蘇聯用的物品，並不加以積極的襲擊。目前向蘇聯前綫開的油　車，像長蛇陣一樣繼籟不斷地拖。固然一部份敵機會想破壞堆油車站，但這是英國飛機向多瑙河口的轟炸，以及向多瑙河投落的機雷有關，是阻撓向德國開行的運輪火車，目的似乎是在於削弱西歐和意大利戰綫上的德國戰力。」</p>
<p>此種言言論是否屬實，姑置不論，但英美在巴爾幹和蘇聯間的利害術突，也表現於這一點上，是值得注意的。同時英美問的作風不同，在此也可以充分表現出來。美國飛機主要在白畫來襲，往往毫不忌諱地以三五百架大飛機羣，公開衝向市空。但英國飛機，常常是以兩三架偷偷襲入市空。這是證明，英國在德國產無人道地發揮飛機的威力，而在巴爾幹則不願得罪大衆，企圖使美國獨擔人民的仇視，眞可以說英國用心的周到。因此，在轟炸方面英國非常狡猾，乘美國的實行恐怖轟炸，而進行收撓人心的工作。蘇聯與英美相反，並不焦燥，而非常鎮靜，轟炸只限於直接戰鬥的前綫目標。其所以沉着應戰者，是由於德國緊密地牽制住蘇聯的空軍，而無暇光顧他處。在實力方面，鐵路沿錢，飛機塲，街頸巷尾，農村田舍，都可以看到德羅軍隊的親密合作。這是不容許因戰局或謀略動搖德國本土的人民所致。</p>
<p>食糧豐富</p>
<p>在街頭尾所看到的，是食糧的豐富程度。在所有飯館中給吃的飯榮，令我驚奇，決覺不出來是在交戰國內吃飯。像在德國一星期才能吃得到的三百五十公分肉，在羅京一頓飯內就可以吃到這許多。甚至在德國根本看不到的冷飯，在羅京則應有盡有。我會到能　的下流飯館去過，竟給捧來帶骨頭的肉湯。家庭食維雖然是配給制，但毫無不方便處。因爲羅馬尼亞是農業業牧畜國，所以無論是布加列斯特，也無論是布達佩斯，食糧始終是豐富的。尤其去年，不麥豐收關係，甚至乞丐也吃白麵包。對於筆者，自麵包海然好久未曾下嚥下，此次特別感覺到好吃。但另一方面，却感覺到德國的食糧決不成問題，因爲訂仰賴於於羅國，於於是便不必替德國捏着一把冷汗了。在羅京到處可以聽到，在巴爾幹增加生產五穀，在德國技術和機械的指導之下，日益收獲成效。</p>
<p>現在對於羅馬尼亞供給德國的食糧數目，以及通商情形，官方諱莫如深，我們無法探知，但我認爲假如將來再對羅馬尼亞和洪牙利的吃飯，加以限制，則其剩餘食糧，一定很多，而足夠保障德國戰時食糧政策的。</p>
<p>參戰以來，固然生活情形惡化了，但每一個羅馬尼亞人，或每一個洪牙利人，至少仍然還吃兩份德國人的食糧</p>
<p>煤油天府</p>
<p>出差汽車，因　胎被徵，近來完全絕跡，但因煤沖天府之國，凡備有自川汽車者，自空　以來，便毫無限制地大量購買汽油。一九四〇年煤油產額降低爲四百萬噸，但後來由於改正煤油法，斥退英法比荷等外國資本，進而採用德國技術，整頓各種施策，所以自從一九三六年以來逐漸縮减的油田產額，而於去年糾正過來，竟收獲到空前的成績，以達五百五十萬噸。今後還可以希望百尺竿頭更進一布的增加生產產訂董。其可能性的限度，當然也決定於戰綫上的耍求，此外關於煉油的能力，據說可以保險一千萬噸，所以事實上，並未這受到轟炸機的威脅。</p>
<p>至於運輸機關，現在多瑙河裹業己按設油管，且其他强化策也會煞費苦心計書過，所以德國的戰時煤油消費量，是可以不必祀憂的。假如將來羅馬尼亞的煤油，完全由德國獨占的話神其採納能力還將提高，這證明德國的燃科問題決不會受影響的。（魯譯自六月三十日讀賣報報知）</p>

<p>署長致詞</p>
<p>十時正本會開始，由宮署長主席行禮如幾後，即致開會詞，略謂：　盟邦讓渡本區治安，使吾人本自力更生求現代建設以局部為起點，擴大至於全域，使同盟條約之諾言，逐一寬現實為快慰不勝感謝。　在大東亞決戰期內中日兩國應有同仇敵愾的精神，吾們應自覺地確負鞏固後方治安的責任與日本協力完遂戰爭。　本區治安雖經讓渡，但吾人應以虛心請益的態度，去發揮和衷共濟的精神，今後深望盟邦能隨時就各種地方行政的措施上不吝賜教。</p>

<p>因變相投資企業之興盛，而造成股市一蹶不振，此種影響整個工商企業之發展，實有妨礙整個社會之真正繁榮，故政府當局，對於近數月來，跌進票面股票之公司內容，極為注意，并將派員調查上市股票之公司組織內容，業務狀况，資產負債情形，如查實確有上市股票資產，以及營業不及股值者，當即取締上市交易，或勒令淸算營業，此案一旦付諸實施，當能維護一般持股者有保障。據記者探悉，最近有上市股票之公司，為維護信醫及顧及股東權利起見，除右華成實業公司官布自動淸算，照股票票面所組十足收回外，現有聯華地產公司及綸華染織廠，為减小籌碼，增高股價，保障股東利益，　　　公司本身之　　　見。分別定期召開股東會議，討論實行減資，發還增資設款，其設還辦法，大致為每三股這還二股，以現金發給，不折不扣，按公司减　錢，可場憑資　所值，而昭股票價値之信任。</p>

<p>第二，防止收買商號坐鎮於米糧集散地，與行政機關之間締結契約，專使行政機關處理賢金與實物，因此，發生對農民不付於資金等惡弊。現金與實物因絕對使商號自行處理。</p>
<p>以治安不良為理由而取上述方法的商號之存在申，是最應注視的事實。米統會所發表的，乃各商號應自行收買，而規定其利潤每石在百元以內。然而各收買商大多自身拱手而坐，由行政機關承包收買商的行為，而擾獲得一定的利潤，道實是數壞米糧統制收買大事的蠢賊。</p>
<p>且這種不良商號每乘機破壞行政機構的貪汚與不誠意。使行政機關作惡舞弊，而將一切痛苦的負擔轉嫁於農民的罪惡，實應由這種商號負責。他們實是戰爭與民生的逆賊，應從嚴處斷。</p>
<p>第三，全面的淘汰各商號的不良掮客，商號與農民之間直接用現金與實物交換，排除一切中間榨取。</p>
<p>因為市價與收買價格之問有鉅大的差額，致農民不供出米糧，這種純粹經濟上的利賣所造成的收買困難，加以修正，並不很困難的。但市價急騰時，對農民的供出不付代價，其影響如何，不難想像，不正官吏，不正商人，固應斷然肅正，但另應確立新的原則，各商號絕對不能利用這種不正分子，這當然是最困難的事。這困難的克服，不是技術問題，而是有關治安，政治，收買的根本革新的重大問題，排除萬難以打開這革新的路，非此不能避免行政收買的弊竇。（譯自六月二十四日大陸新報）</p>

<p>— 水佑楣</p>
<p>查本市財政，百孔千瘡，由來已久，牽　補屋，煞費苦心，近複交通閉塞，生産衰落，經濟運用停滯，地方稅收銳減，是以各項經費，時感不敷，環境使然，無怪乎當事者之艱於應付也，惟事有捨本逐末，措　失當，若政府當局之以地方正常捐稅，招人承包，甘飽少數人私囊，寧短市金庫收入者，則誠爲不取。</p>
<p>查本市三十三年度歲入總概算，編列爲二億六千零九十九萬零三百七十四元七角，其中以捐稅居第一位，除特賦與補助款外，佔總額百分之四一·五，捐稅之收入，以田賦爲首，佔總額百分之四○·七，經由當局設置賦稅管理處，派員徴收，有周密之組織，健全之人事，嚴明之賞罰，冊書有舞弊者懲處，田戶有滯納者追比，諸如辦理，其成績無不斐然可觀，惟如煙酒·牌照·竹木·豬隻等稅，不取法賦稅，而招人承包，是則市庫之莫大損失，亦即當事者失於攷慮。查前項各稅收入，按照概算所列僅佔總額百分之八，計二百十萬零四千五百七十二元，核與事實，不無疑義，茲僅以竹木稅一項爲證，包額已達一百八十萬元，則其他如煙酒·牌照·豬隻等稅之收入，　僅及竹木稅六分之一耶？</p>
<p>蓋包稅制度弊　重重，於公既無裨補，於民且多損害，會於民國二十五年間經財部通令嚴予禁止，由當地有關機關辦理，實徵實解在案。鄙人前隨家君宦遊福建某縣府，時地方財政紊亂不堪，所有屠宰·營業·煙酒·牌照等稅，因格於省令及歷任成案，招人承包，固定稅額，按月報解，當主官下　伊始，若輩鹹以爲有機可乘，四出活動，於是推薦介紹信件，雪片紛擊，逐鹿營鑽，戶限爲穿，甚至以財物爲賄賂者，或高擡包額爲酬報者，醜態百出，權利是　。該縣一　爾小邑，市況蕭條，稅收亦屬有限，其相互角逐尚如是者，則商務鼎盛，財源總滙，而稱爲遍地黃金之上海自無論矣。</p>
<p>矧若輩之資格，大都會在公務中被撤汰之貪墨冗員，或具有雄厚　勢力與背景之土劣地痞，對上則搖尾乞憐，盡其獻媚　　之能事，徼固屍位，對下則狐假虎威，施其橫征暴斂之慣技，　充私囊，不惜費相當之運動費用，以徼得低級之包額，壟斷包辦，一意利己。其承包方式，有大包與小包之別，大包將一包之包額，加以至厚利益，分包與若幹小包，一勞永逸，坐收漁利，裘葛一易，則面團團腹便便成爲富家翁矣？小包因切身利害關係，抱多收一分即多得一分利益之旨，以市民爲　上肉，任意膾割，月入之豐即國府大員亦不能及其萬一，因此，承包人之取得承包權者，視同珍寶，當局以爲有限之稅收，僅能充徴收經費，不若招人承包之爲得，詎知實徵數超於承包數者，曷止倍蓗，因一時之失策，而放棄無限權益，使市民受魚池之殃，而增意外痛苦，積於淫威之下，莫不敢怒而不敢言。在茲米珠　桂，民不聊生之秋，如再受藉公肥私之徒，搜吸　脂，則落井下石，斃可立待。</p>
<p>夫包稅之害，不僅在民，且涉於政，此制不廢，稅收不裕，有稅不理，開源自　徒負虛名，有害不除，財政何時可望充裕；而行政效率亦何能提高？況財政爲庶政之母，稅收是財政之本，尤其在茲大東亞戰事方酣，而後方之治安，教育建設，以及物質之增産等行政工作，均應積極興辦，本市爲全國經濟之動脈，物質之倉庫，對於上項要務，實屬急不容緩，唯茲事體大，非有充實經費不爲功，經費之所出，即捐稅之所入也，是以整理財政，爲充實經費之先聲，廢除包稅，爲整理財政之要經，若仍墨守舊制，不但作　自縛，且養虎遺患，爲害無窮，亟　當局即將百弊而無一利之包稅制度，澈底廢除，則庫裕民蘇，受惠無窮矣。</p>

<h3 id="c57">住院七日記 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 惠英</p>
<p>我最怕病，尤其是在客居外鄉的時候。但是在外四年，我卻年年病，而尤以這次病得最厲害。病的起因是飲食不加小心。既病以後，病勢卻急轉直下，由瀉肚而成爲瀉血。一天六七次，每次總是滿盆鮮血。我從來沒有過這種病，所以嚇得我不容或緩　去就醫。</p>
<p>經友人介紹，我來到南洋醫院，診治我的醫生，是全國醫學界最著名的吳朝仁先生。經他檢察的結果，當時就斷定我病不是內痔，不過要往檢便和驗血，方可說是何種痢疾。同時按照吳醫生的意思，最好是能住院。住院我卻有點怕，因爲我從來沒有住過院。同時，常聽人說，醫院裏的人是如何地勢利。醫生·護士·工人等，對待病人態度的好壞，都是以病人經濟狀況爲轉移的。而我只是一個窮學生，對於住院與否，使我不能不煞費躊　了。結果，我還是決定住院，因爲寄居在友人家裏，生病委實太不方便，何況是具有傳染性的痢疾呢？</p>
<p>進院的第一天，經檢便和驗血的結果，吳醫生發現了我病是急性阿米巴痢疾。大概每隔三小時就要吃一次藥。</p>
<p>第二天雖然便血，但次數和量數卻大爲減少。吳醫生決不因已見好轉，而就讓助手代勞，仍是笑容滿面不時跑來問病把脈。護士也常常照顧我，體貼無微不至。</p>
<p>南洋醫院的院長顧南羣先生，是一位熱心社會福利的慈善家。每天盡管東奔西走，事業繁忙八時至對於該醫院，卻每天躬親必到，視察病房，詢問病人需要。而且常常訓示護士，工友多給病人方便和照應。無怪我住院兩天，就漸漸感覺熟悉起來，好像回到了老家，受著父母兄弟姊妹的關照一樣。當我看見顧院長親來問病，就好像身體完全複原了。</p>
<p>第三天，便血已停止，我開始要求出院，但吳醫生微笑著不准。他的理由是我便血剛停止，而大便並不健全。同時，由急性痢疾往往容易轉成慢性痢疾。待到慢性痢疾，那病就　　了。</p>
<p>那天我是默默地過去了，使我心理感到不安的，不是我不相信醫生的話，而是那筆每天住院的負擔。</p>
<p>以後，我的體溫正常了，護士們一有空，總溜到我的床邊和我談天。還有一位陳醫生也有時來的。她們常常講一些令人舒暢的故事，致使我受不到思家病及新愁舊恨的襲擊。</p>
<p>第五天，我又再三要求出院。那天正是端午節，吳醫生總是從不改變他那副笑容可掬，而且令人感覺痛快的面孔，和靄地說。“你的大便依然有菌，別忙著要過節吧！”我想出院的惟一理由，並不是要過節，更不是住厭了醫院，而是我經濟的拮據。吳醫生依然是那樣微笑而誠摯地說：“我知道，住院費，院長會幫你忙的，因爲他是爲社會服務，爲公衆謀幸福的人。即是我這部份的醫治費，也可以免收的。醫生的任務和目的是在醫人。你放心吧！只要你病好，一切問題都容易解決”。他揮著手，表示他忙於要看第二個病人了。我無聲地笑著，竟不知應該說一句什麽話，感激吧！但當時竟沒有一句感激的話。</p>
<p>第六天准我出外，不過要在第七天檢便後，方准我出院。</p>
<p>護士們知道我即將出院了，就來告訴我，她們的姓名和地址，希望我到她們家裏去玩。她們的如水柔情，使我否定了過去所聽到的一般對護士不好的批評。住院七天，使人難以忘懷的，是院長，醫生以及護士們對病人的高度關心，忠實診治和親切的看護。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>櫻與錨（九）</p>
<p>隆夫心情很快活地喝醉了。真人不斷地口中稱讚“軍艦”這張畫的優點，更加增強了隆夫的醉意。</p>
<p>“我如果在海軍方面有人，能看見大演習之類的事情，我想一定能畫出會心之作來。像大砲的煙，魚雷的航跡等，真想看一次。在吳鎮沒有這樣機會麽？”</p>
<p>“那末，你需要一個資格麽？……”</p>
<p>“就是需要一個資格，我很想有一個資格……”</p>
<p>因爲醉了，隆夫就說了一部份不應當說的話，但真人卻認真地聽。</p>
<p>“總而言之，明天是星期，我也放假，那末我領你到潛水學校去參觀吧！學校也放假，但那邊有朋友，所以參觀是可以的。”</p>
<p>“潛水學校？那可好了！我對於潛水艇是非常有興味的。但真人還未坐過潛水艇麽？現在服務的軍艦，不是潛水艇麽？”</p>
<p>“不。”</p>
<p>但這次真人也沒有說真話。</p>
<p>須臾間，女僕拿飯來。二人吃完飯，　人呌算賬。</p>
<p>“今天晚上，在我旅館裏住吧！現在時間還早，不到中通大街去麽？這是吳鎮的銀座大馬路呀！”</p>
<p>倆個人站起來，向走廊走去。隆夫因爲把行李早已運往鹿兒島，所以只剩一只皮包，很方便。</p>
<p>正當從走廊向大門走的時候，廁所的門突然一開，出現了一位姿勢美觀的穿軍服的士兵。</p>

<h3 id="e1">North China Japanese Consuls Confer on Important Policies, Decide to Strive for Increased Production to Ensure War Resources <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - A conference of consulates under the Peiping Office of the Japanese Embassy in China was held in the consul's office at 9:00 AM on the 14th. From the embassy side, Minister Kamizawa, Chief of General Affairs Tsuchiya, and heads of various departments and sections attended. From the Japanese Army in North China, Commanders Tsukamoto and Nakanishi attended, along with consuls-general and consuls from Peiping, Tientsin, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Shihchiachuang, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Changtien, Tangshan, and Hsuchow. After the opening ceremony, Minister Kamizawa gave instructions on the determination that should be made in dealing with the situation in North China at this stage. Commander Tsukamoto then explained the current state of public order. Subsequently, the heads of each department reported on matters under their jurisdiction. After that, the entire group held various consultations on concrete measures to increase production and transportation in preparation for the decisive battle. The important points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In order to enhance combat power, special measures should be adopted. To ensure the production of war resources in North China in order to complete the war, it was decided to complete the past goals of increasing production and transportation in phases, and to implement the reform and strengthening of labor management. At the same time, in order to ensure the smooth progress of food procurement, it was decided to secure Chinese laborers and strongly mobilize Japanese students and engineering teams to actively increase production. Cooperation with relevant agencies is needed to vigorously promote the above tasks. Naturally, the full cooperation of the Japanese Army in North China is required. At the same time, cooperation methods will be sought with the North China Political Affairs Commission, especially on labor issues, and the utmost assistance of Chairman Wang Kemin is particularly expected.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of the mission undertaken by North China, the responsibility of the 400,000 Japanese residents in North China has also increased accordingly. Regarding the important policies of the normal bureau in the future, no one will be allowed to make unwarranted slanders or criticisms. If there are legitimate opinions, they should be directly reported to the authorities. In short, the 400,000 Japanese residents should unite and cooperate with the 100 million people of North China to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - This year, the focus of the North China Labor Association's work is to supply sufficient labor to various important industrial sectors in North China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, due to the rising prices in North China this year, it is difficult to obtain the required labor force by following past recruitment methods. Therefore, an office system for the board of directors has been established in the headquarters to smoothly handle labor affairs. At the same time, the responsibility system for various offices and branches, and the business undertaking organization, are also designed to ensure that each office and branch maintains close contact with the responsible business organization to investigate the labor needs in various regions. Even if various regions do not entrust them to handle recruitment, when it is recognized that labor is insufficient and urgently needs to be supplemented, labor will be supplied immediately, so that the operation of businesses in various regions will not be hindered in any way.</p>
<h3 id="e2">War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia in One Week <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The war situation in various parts of the Greater East Asia war zone in the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>On the China front, the Japanese army's southward units are still besieging and attacking the isolated city of Hengyang, while continuing to advance southward. B. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army's northward units in Guangdong Province crossed the Yunjiang River, 20 kilometers south of Yingde, a strategic point on the Yuehan Railway, on the 11th, and defeated the Chongqing army, continuing their advance. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army on this front has collected over 1,000 bodies of Chongqing soldiers and captured 286 prisoners, as well as 5 cannons and 581 other light and heavy machine guns and rifles by the 11th. (Air War) The Japanese air force not only directly cooperated with the land battles, but also aimed to thoroughly crush the Chongqing-US air force. Therefore, they have launched attacks on separate advance bases in Zhijiang, Ganzhou, Xincheng, Suichuan, Liangshan, Danzhu, and Guilin for days, achieving brilliant results and inflicting major blows on the Chongqing-US air force. The main battle results are recorded as follows: The number of Chongqing-US aircraft destroyed or burned was 28 in Guilin on the 10th, 14 in Danzhu on the 11th, 51 in Zhijiang on the 12th, and 89 in Guilin on the 13th, for a total of 182. According to the Chongqing-US aircraft raids in early July, there were a total of 224 sorties, with a cumulative number of 1,245 aircraft. However, from the 1st to the 13th, the Japanese air force alone achieved 277 kills, so the Chongqing-US aircraft suffered heavy losses. On the Burma front (Land War), the enemy attempted to break through the Kohima-Imphal road, so they gradually increased their troops in the Imphal basin, and also attempted to recapture Ukhrul. The enemy in the Palel and Bishenpur areas, with the support of artillery and tanks, launched attacks, but were repelled by the Japanese army. The land war situation in various places is recorded as follows: A. On the Northern Burma front, the Japanese army has strengthened its counter-offensive posture against the newly formed First Army of the Chongqing army gradually moving south from the area of Gamunying and the Chongqing army attacking near Umyogaon. B. In the Myitkyina area, the local Japanese army is repelling the American-style 14th Division and the newly formed 31st Division of the Chongqing army and the US army with a small number of troops everywhere. On the 6th, the Japanese army took advantage of the Chongqing-US army's weakness to launch a surprise attack, daring to carry out a night raid on their main positions. In this battle, a total of 138 bodies of Chongqing-US soldiers were counted, and 78 people were captured. According to the 50 days since the Chongqing-US army launched its counter-offensive on May 17, the number of those killed and wounded reached 11,000. C. On the Nujiang front, the 21st and 11th Group Armies of the Chongqing army in the Tengyue, Mangshi, and Longling areas have suffered heavy losses, and their counter-offensive attempts have been crushed. (Air War) On the 7th and 9th, the Japanese air force braved the adverse weather and launched two surprise attacks on the Myitkyina airfield, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft and setting fire to all 16 large transport aircraft and 23 P40 aircraft on the ground. In the Central Pacific, the Japanese army and navy units fighting in the Saipan Island battle gradually reorganized their battle lines. On the night of the 10th, they defended the cave positions near Mount Marpi and launched a brave bayonet charge against the enemy's positions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, in order to support the army and navy operations, the Japanese air force bombed the enemy's positions on Saipan Island and the enemy's cruiser and destroyer groups in the waters east of the island on the night of the 6th, and bombed the Aslito airfield on the night of the 7th. Moreover, the enemy army is still increasing its air force strength to the airfield, and on the 10th, several large enemy transport aircraft and 50 small aircraft were found to be landing one after another, and more than 20 large ships were anchored in the port. Also, two enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, and more than 30 destroyers were moving in the waters northwest of Tinian Island. On the 10th, dozens of enemy aircraft attacked Tinian Island, and enemy ships also shelled the island day and night. At the same time, the Japanese army's artillery on the island also fired back, and on the 6th, a large bomb was fired to bombard the Aslito airfield. From the 6th to the 13th, more than 340 enemy aircraft in total attacked Omiya Island (more than 33 shot down by the Japanese), and on the 9th and 13th, enemy battleships, cruisers, and destroyers shelled Rota Island, Yap Island, and Truk Island, and were also repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft. In the South Pacific, on the Solomon Islands front, enemy aircraft occasionally attacked the Japanese army's positions in Rabaul, Gabien, Radbury in Namatanai, Buka area, and the southern part of Bougainville Island.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese China Expeditionary Army Refutes Chongqing Propaganda: Japanese Army Never Used Poison Gas <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - As the Japanese army's offensive operations in Central China are progressing steadily and the Chongqing army has suffered repeated defeats that are difficult to conceal, rumors have been spread since the end of June, when Hengyang was on the verge of collapse, that the Japanese army used poison gas. The Japanese China Expeditionary Army issued a written statement on the 15th, denying this and stating that since the end of June, the Chongqing side has been propagating that the Japanese army used poison gas on the Hunan front. However, the Japanese army has always valued morality and ethics. Not only has it never taken such actions in the past, but it will not adopt such inhuman combat methods in the future unless the Chongqing side uses them first. This is because the Chongqing army has no way to deal with the Japanese army's current operations, so it has resorted to this inferior strategy, using propaganda to cover up its defeat. This is the same tactic as the previous propaganda during the Changde Battle, when the Japanese army was said to have used poison gas, and its pitiful attitude is truly laughable.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Achieves Victory in Xiangxiang</p>
<p>A certain Japanese army base in Southern Hunan, 15th (Central News Agency) - After the Ersi of the Yuehan Railway, the Fourth Chongqing Army and other defeated Chongqing troops were mopped up everywhere. In recent days, the 15th Division of the Chongqing army, which wanted to recapture Xiangxiang, has launched counterattacks in the Xiangxiang area. As a result of the fierce fighting, in addition to killing 200 Chongqing soldiers and capturing 34 prisoners, one mortar and many light machine guns were seized. On the Japanese side, two soldiers were killed and injured. Also, on the 9th at noon, the Japanese army's southward advancing unit discovered about 600 soldiers of the 98th Division of the Chongqing army near Huangpi (10 kilometers west of Weiyang) and immediately attacked them, defeating them.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese army front-line base in Hunan, 15th (Central News Agency) - At dawn on the 11th, the Chongqing army attempted to recapture Anren. The Japanese army immediately intercepted and launched a bayonet charge, and finally defeated them, seizing countless military supplies.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing side announced the battle situation on the evening of the 14th as follows: On the Hunan front, the Japanese army has been bombing Hengyang day and night. On the night of the 12th, they carried out artillery bombardment again. Japanese ground troops broke into the Chongqing army's defense line, but were stopped by the Chongqing army reinforcements. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army advancing north along the Yuehan Railway forcibly crossed the river at Lianjiang, 20 kilometers south of Yingde, breaking through the obstacles on the Yingde road. Regarding the above news, a United Press correspondent reported as follows: The Chongqing side claims that the Japanese army in Hunan is preparing for a new offensive, and predicts that there may be even fiercer battles within a week. Although the authorities have not confirmed the Japanese army's occupation of Laiyang, judging from the news of the 14th Air Force bombing Laiyang, it is clear that Laiyang has been occupied by the Japanese army. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army west of the Yuehan Railway is still advancing on Yingde, a strategic point 110 kilometers north of Guangdong.</p>
<p>US Aircraft Blindly Bomb Xinxiang Station</p>
<p>Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) - At around 1:55 PM on July 14, eight B-25 type aircraft and three P-40 type aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing flew over Xinxiang on the Yuehan Railway and blindly bombed densely populated residential areas, and attacked the station. A considerable number of Japanese travelers and nearby residents on the express train were killed and injured. In general, travelers deeply resent the inhuman blind bombing by US aircraft.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from New Delhi on the 14th, a strong force of the Japanese army in the Wewak area of New Guinea launched a fierce attack to the west on the 10th, attempting to break through the US army's positions. According to a spokesman for the Southwest Pacific Command, the US has reinforced artillery and aircraft from Hollandia and is planning to build a defensive position in the area.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in the Central Pacific, enemy aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked Omiya Island, becoming increasingly fierce. On the 14th, 85 aircraft attacked the island again.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Ledo Road, which replaced the Burma Road, is a major lifeline for Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing and American technicians assisting Chongqing are doing their best to build it. According to news arriving here on the 14th, the construction of the Ledo Road is still continuing under the activities of American technicians and Chongqing laborers, but this is a difficult task. Especially in the heavy rain of June, no progress was made. At the same time, due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army, the road is completely impassable at present.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Gandhi Advocates Establishing an Indian National Government, Does Not Accept Cripps Proposal <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong, 15th (Central News Agency) - Gandhi previously proposed a solution to the Indian-Muslim opposition to the head of the Muslim League, asking the Muslim League to cooperate in establishing a new Indian government and launching a political offensive against the British government. On the 13th of this month, he also issued a statement in Bombay, advocating the establishment of an Indian national government. "Unless I discuss it with the Working Committee of the Congress Party, I cannot take any action. This proposal of mine is completely different from the proposal made by the Working Committee when the British proposed the Cripps proposal in 1942. I now believe that a national government should be organized to control all powers of Indian civil administration. The personnel should be elected from the members of the Central Legislative Assembly. Even under wartime conditions, independence should be declared, and the British Governor and the British King should stand in the same position, assisted by responsible cabinet members." Gandhi said in the above statement that he would withdraw the statement of British withdrawal from India under wartime conditions, requiring the establishment of a national government that fully controls Indian civil administration, and adopting a compromise to enable India to embark on the road to full independence. In fact, if Gandhi's proposal is fully recognized, it is predicted that the following events will inevitably occur in the future: 1. Britain recognizes Indian independence. 2. Under wartime conditions, British sovereignty in India only remains in name. Britain still retains the command of military operations, and its military status is not even as authoritative as the US military stationed in Chongqing. 3. Matters related to the mobilization of military stations and supplies must also be directed by the National Government's Minister of National Defense. 4. The practice of an independent national government is obviously anti-British. The above items are inevitable for Britain, which uses India as a base for invading East Asia, and cannot be tolerated. Regarding Gandhi's new proposal, the famous Indian expert Hughes wrote an article in the English Times on the 13th, expressing his opposition, saying that it is impossible for a country that is fighting with all its national strength to divide politics, civil administration, and military affairs into three departments. From this, it can be seen that Britain will never recognize Gandhi's proposal. Gandhi's intention is to temporarily remove the sign of British influence and withdrawal, so that the impression of harmony permeates internally and externally, and to make Britain less stubborn and more superficial, in order to speculate on the great anti-British movement. This is actually a major political offensive against Britain.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Bombay, Gandhi issued a statement on the 14th, saying: Cripps' proposal on the Indian issue is tantamount to splitting India, so I cannot accept the proposal. Indian freedom should have been realized long ago. If Cripps' proposal can be implemented, Indian freedom will be greatly hindered. Jinnah, the head of the Muslim League, may not oppose my proposal, but the British government never wants to solve the issue of Indian independence, using Jinnah as an excuse and not giving India freedom. Therefore, we must eliminate the evils that suppress Indian freedom.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Poona, Kangatthal, the former Governor of Mumbai Province, was imprisoned in August 1943 for his relationship with the Congress Party's disobedience movement. He was released on the 14th. This is the first release of a Congress Party leader after Gandhi's release.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Heavy Sacrifices in European Invasion, Fierce Fighting in the Battle for Saint-Lô, 500,000 British Troops Gather in the Caen Area <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 14th that the US army had suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting with the German army in the forest northwest of Saint-Lô. The US army on the Carentan-Périers highway has continued its offensive in the past few days, and the fighting is now intensifying. The German army has made a planned retreat in the area between the Cotentin Peninsula's western wing high swamp area and the coast, and continues to prevent the enemy army from advancing in the defensive position in the Lessey-Haut Kocher swamp area. Since the US army launched its invasion operation in and northwest of Saint-Lô, it has carried out the largest artillery battle, with a battle line of about 10 kilometers, bombarded with 100 cannons, and has continued for several hours.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The US army's major offensive in the southern Cotentin Peninsula, which began on July 2, has only extended 10 kilometers south from the line of Saint-Lô-Duville-Rimou-Male-Kagers-to-Dut-Vil River as of the 14th. The US army has suffered heavy losses in the 12 days, and has only reached the line of Angoville-Lalo-Seri and Pont-Hebert, advancing an average of only 500 meters per day. This kind of snail's pace is no different from that in Italy, which shows how little the US army has accomplished. There is no major change in the war near Lalo Seri. The US army has made slight progress between the Dut Ville River. The German tank corps has launched a surprise attack deep into the US army's position. In the past 24 hours, the anti-Axis army launched a large-scale offensive on the Trebehou-Pont Hebert line and has broken through several points. The German army is now counterattacking. The US army has not yet reached the Périers-Saint-Lô highway.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The British Second Army occupies a bridgehead of 800 square kilometers between Caen and Bayeux. The British army is now gathering troops, four army corps and two tank divisions. It is estimated that the total strength in the area (including domestic army and autonomous area army) is about 500,000 people. It is expected that the front line of the bridgehead has about 3,000 tanks, but 1,500 have been destroyed since the start of the invasion (excluding those captured by the national army).</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for British and American Ships</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The British Navy Department and the US Navy Department published a list on July 13, announcing the losses of Japanese warships from June 6 to July 13. However, according to German naval personnel, the list only includes one-seventh of the actual losses of British and American ships. The actual number of British and American warships sunk from June 6 to July 13 is as follows: 2 heavy cruisers, 4 other cruisers, 26 destroyers, 1 transport ship, and 1 speedboat. The number of those heavily damaged includes several British and American capital ships, 22 cruisers, 25 destroyers, 13 speedboats, and 28 special landing craft. German naval officials said at the end that the above figures do not include enemy warships that were sunk by mines.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Empty Words of Joint US-China War Effort in Chongqing <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Military experts here have recently expressed their views on the joint operations between the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, and explained the truth behind the US's enthusiastic calls for joint US-China warfare. The gist of their remarks is as follows: Since the Japanese army launched its mainland offensive, the Chongqing side, in its internal and external propaganda, has emphasized that while the Henan and Hunan campaigns are important to Chongqing, the key to the overall situation lies in strengthening air force and mechanical power, as well as the situation on the India-Burma front. Judging from their words, it seems they believe the responsibility for the mainland front lies with the US and Britain. This is essentially Chongqing's demand that US weapons must absolutely cooperate with the Chongqing army in combat, and they hope to use joint US-China warfare to escape a major crisis. The US, on the one hand, pretends that the US Air Force will not fail Chongqing's expectations, but on the other hand, it still pursues its own ambitions, driving the Chongqing army to fight against Japan. The Japanese army on the Chinese front has captured Changsha and taken Hengyang airfield. Chongqing's important air force bases are not only being successively occupied or destroyed by the Japanese army, but the US Air Force is also suffering heavy blows. In this situation, both Chongqing and the US are suffering, but in reality, Chongqing's sacrifices are extremely great. The reason why the Chongqing army is suffering such heavy losses is, in a word, that they do not understand the nature of the US Air Force. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is now rampaging across the Chinese mainland. In fact, their stationing is driven by the realization of America's arrogant ambitions. Even their concentration of forces on air raids against Japan and on harassing attacks against the Japanese army's rear supply lines does not help Chongqing. What the Chongqing army expects is cooperation with the Chongqing field army in direct combat with the Japanese fighter squadrons. The US Air Force, however, is solely willing to attack the Japanese mainland. This kind of reality can be seen everywhere in the new war. The "joint US-China warfare" shouted by the US military is nothing more than this. In reality, the enemy and the US are by no means cooperating with the Chongqing army in combat. If the Chongqing army fails to see through this situation, they will inevitably suffer the same pain as the US Air Force on the front lines at the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Miao People of Guizhou Resent the US Military</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Recently, a young man named Liu, who escaped from Guiyang, passed through Guilin, Wuzhou, and other places, and arrived in Guangzhou a few days ago. According to reports, this young man is thirty years old this year. Last spring, he served as a transport worker for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, responsible for liaison between Kunming and Guiyang. In late March of this year, he and several friends secretly left Guiyang and returned to his hometown of Guangzhou. According to him, the Miao people of Guizhou are extremely resentful of the atrocities of the US Air Force. The following is a record of his conversation: The US Air Force is now using US dollars to manipulate the Chinese people, because those they employ are all paid in US dollars. Therefore, the monthly living expenses for a family of three (husband, wife, and child) in Guiyang now require 5,000 yuan. Being a minor official is not as lucrative as being their servant. In January and February of last year, there were about 740 British and Americans in Guiyang. In addition, there were air force marines carrying automatic rifles everywhere. They often carried bottles of whiskey and would immediately get drunk and pass out in the streets, or dance wildly in the middle of the road with women by their side. Although a US military officer was shot and killed by the Chongqing Air Force, causing a major issue, we could only swallow our anger and remain silent. In short, they squander money without restraint, which delights unscrupulous merchants, but the people suffer unspeakably. In particular, the three million Miao people out of the nine million population of Guizhou Province are extremely disgusted by this. The Miao people organized the Jingzhong Society in 1938, but after it was suppressed by the Chongqing army, it was reorganized into the Xueguang Society. In September, the Chongqing army killed hundreds of members of the Jingzhong Society. Furthermore, due to tax increases and other issues, the 68th Division was dispatched to suppress them, resulting in 3,500 casualties. Recently, the oppression of the Miao people has intensified, and the resentment of the Miao people has also become increasingly profound. They will be even more angered by the US Air Force, which is working hand in hand with the Chongqing army. At the end of March this year, the Xueguang Society's self-defense army raided the US Air Force in Guiyang, and weapons depots, heavy-duty vehicles, and so on were all destroyed.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The supply of rice in Nanjing is abundant, and prices have fallen. Superior rice is about 4,200 yuan, and ordinary rice is 2,700 to 2,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Stabilize in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the local authorities promulgated the "Temporary Measures for Civil Food" to protect rice merchants, allow them to freely transport rice to designated areas, increase supply, and strictly prohibit black market price gouging, the situation regarding civil food in this city has been improving daily. It is learned that there is a large amount of rice stored in the eastern Zhejiang area recently, and the price is around 3,000 yuan per dan. General traders are eager to take advantage of the potential profits. According to transportation circles, there are more than 1,000 people transporting rice into the city along accessible roads. If each person carries two dou per day, then more than 200 dan of rice arrive in the city daily, which is beneficial to the supply. As a result, people's minds are at ease, and the selling price is gradually softening.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Ministry of Education Promotes the Zhuyin Symbols <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Zhuyin symbols are the only tool for correcting pronunciation and unifying the national language. The Ministry of Education compiled and distributed the "Zhuyin Symbols Training Booklet" in May 1930 to promote it in various regions. In July of the same year, it also formulated 25 measures for provinces, cities, and counties to promote the Zhuyin symbols, and informed the municipal governments and ordered local education departments to comply. After the national government returned to the capital, the Ministry of Education reprinted the national language textbooks with Zhuyin symbols in 1941, and in April of the same year, it issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, instructing their subordinate schools to emphasize national pronunciation in the national language subject. In August of the same year, it reissued the "Zhuyin Symbols Training Booklet" and implementation measures, instructing their strict implementation, and appropriately reprinted the "Training Booklet" for widespread instruction, with the aim of universal application. The Ministry of Education now believes that schools in various regions are not vigorously promoting the instruction and application of the Zhuyin symbols, and that the teaching of the national language subject still often uses local dialects. Efforts should be made to correct this in order to achieve the effect of unifying national pronunciation. It has specially issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, instructing their subordinates to comply with the aforementioned measures, work hard to promote them, and hold summer training sessions, etc., and the subject should be listed as a required course to be taught effectively, with the aim of achieving practical results. On the one hand, it will also adopt relevant measures to establish national language training institutes by the ministry, etc., to transfer personnel from the educational institutions of various provinces and cities to Beijing for training, and order various provinces and cities to hold national pronunciation research meetings in order to promote this.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Mr. Ogawa Gotaro, the supreme advisor to the Burmese government, is currently staying in Tokyo and is scheduled to return to his post before the anniversary of Burmese independence on August 1. He has completed all arrangements for the Burmese government to recruit experts in various fields, and the selections have all been made. In addition, regarding the recruitment of Japanese professors to revitalize Yangon University, Kyoto Imperial University is currently the focus, but the selection of personnel will be officially announced by the Burmese government. According to the policy at the time of Burmese independence, everything was to be handled independently as much as possible. Later, with the progress of the times, it was deemed unnecessary to adhere to the initial policy, and it was decided to hire Japanese authorities from all walks of life as consultants. Therefore, Ogawa came to Tokyo to discuss in detail with Dr. Ba Tin, the head of the Burmese special inspection team visiting Japan, and actively carried out the project. Currently, the internal selections are all first-class Japanese experts, covering agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, transportation, communications, and other departments. It is expected that after the experts go to Burma, they will make great contributions to the progress of Burmese administration.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency reports, military news: On Friday, after several hours of heavy artillery bombardment by Soviet forces, a large-scale offensive, which had been anticipated, was launched between Tarnopol (southeastern old Poland) and Lutsk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - Military news: The war on the Eastern Front is intensifying, and German troops are continuing to conduct avoidance maneuvers, switching to defending shorter and stronger lines. After destroying important military installations in the city of Lutsk, German troops have withdrawn from the city. Military figures emphasize that in order to shorten the defense lines, it is necessary to withdraw from certain cities, but the German retreat is entirely in accordance with the pre-determined plan of the command. After receiving supplies from the air, the German garrison of Vilnius bravely broke through, opening a path to the main German defensive area, during which they had to cross the Viliya River twice.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch: Marshal Stalin announced on Sunday that Soviet troops had occupied Vilnius and Pinsk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - The breakthrough of the German garrison in Vilnius on the Eastern Front should be given importance in terms of military momentum. German troops are continuing to retreat between North Lutvina and Pskov. This move is to secure the Baltic states and consolidate German defenses. While German troops were conducting this avoidance maneuver, fierce fighting took place between Idritsa and Novosokholniki, as Soviet troops attempted to obstruct the German retreat. The focus of the war on the Eastern Front is now on Daugavpils. Soviet troops have repeatedly attacked German positions there, and the fighting is fierce, but all attacks have been repulsed by German troops. Another focus of the war is north and south of Grodno. German positions there are also under heavy attack by the enemy. German artillery concentrated its bombardment and ultimately defeated them. On the southern and central fronts, German troops have withdrawn from the city of Pinsk, but the enemy has not yet attacked the city. This is due to the original German plan to establish an obstacle line behind the Shchara River to the east of Brest-Litovsk. Reconnaissance patrols are active on the southern front. German and Hungarian forces encountered Soviet forces in the advance of Kolomyia in the Carpathians. Soviet reconnaissance patrols penetrated German positions but were repulsed by counterattacks. The thin German forces in Plock have withdrawn to the main defensive area.</p>

<p>Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a British dispatch from Naples: German troops in Italy are building a new fortress, the "Goth Line." The original dispatch is as follows: Staff officers of General Alexander, the Allied commander on the Italian front, predict that the German Goth Line will be even stronger than the Gustav Line at Cassino in southern Italy. The Goth Line stretches approximately 80 kilometers, lying northwest of the Trasimene Line. It is a major fortress built on mountains 1,900 meters above sea level. German troops are using all major defenses to construct positions and firing points, and are further constructing a key fortress on the 903-meter-high Futa Pass on the Trasimene-Bologna highway. The mountain road leading up to the pass is impassable. German troops have constructed many firing points there. The Apennine peaks are covered with snow and difficult to traverse after late autumn. In addition, the dense forests obscure the sky, making it impossible to reconnoiter German movements from the air.</p>
<p>Paratroopers Launch Surprise Attack to Regain High Ground Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 14th: The focus of the fighting in Italy is currently north of Lake Trasimeno and on both banks of the Tiber River. German troops are launching counterattacks in various places to close or repel Allied breakthroughs. In the Pucciarelli area, Allied forces stubbornly attacked under the cover of numerous tanks. German troops temporarily abandoned this strategically important location. After a counterattack by German paratroopers, the enemy was repelled, and important high ground south of Poggio was retaken.</p>
<p>Commander of Italian Legion Killed</p>
<p>Milan, 15th (German News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Italian military headquarters, the often-praised commander of the famous "Barbarigo" Legion was recently murdered by communists. The communists also murdered several soldiers returning from the Anzio front, including three naval officers and five sailors, all belonging to the aforementioned legion.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Overseas Chinese News Agency Dispatch) - British and American officials are cautious in their statements regarding negotiations with Turkey. US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt, after meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, declared that the Allied powers would intensify cooperation with Turkey. Secretary of State Hull stated that Turkey has repeatedly encountered opportunities to discuss issues of advancing relations with the Allied powers, and is now encountering another opportunity to discuss these issues. Responsible parties in Berlin have not mentioned the Allied powers' demands on Turkey, but they are not lacking in information. The news from British and American newspapers and news agencies is contradictory, with some saying that Turkey is about to join the war or break off relations with Germany, and then cede Turkish airfields and Straits bases to the Allied powers. British and American newspapers claim that the initiator of the negotiations is the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union remains silent. From all sides, the British ambassador seems to be the most active. "The Daily Telegraph" believes that the Soviet Union hopes to join the Anglo-Turkish alliance. Well-informed sources in Berlin are skeptical of this, because both Britain and the Soviet Union have ambitions for the Straits, and it is difficult for them to be sincere with each other. "The Daily Bulletin" reported that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will go to Turkey in a short time to participate in the negotiations. This is also possible, but the rumor that Vyshinsky is already in Turkey has been disproven.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Turkish Foreign Ministry met with reporters on the 14th and stated that it is true that the representatives of the British, American, and Soviet governments have begun to be active in Turkish diplomatic circles again, but the Turkish government has repeatedly reiterated its hope that the Turkish people will stand outside the war. To this day, the Turkish government cannot adopt any other policy. Regarding the oppression of Soviet policy, it is still doubtful whether it can win the sympathy of the United States and Britain. As for what demands the Allied camp is now making on the Turkish government, it is feared that it cannot be stated clearly. All that the Allied propaganda organs are spreading is contradictory.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to "The Times" of London: The city of London has recently evacuated its population according to plan. The evacuees are defined as: 1. Primary and secondary school students aged 5 to 10; 2. Mothers with children under the age of 5; 3. The infirm; 4. Minors; and 5. Those who do not need to stay in the city and wish to evacuate. The plan is supervised and implemented by the London City Council. Everything is the same as the evacuation during the large-scale air raids of previous years. The Security Department has also announced that underground air-raid shelters will be opened soon. There are eight of these air-raid shelters, all more than 100 feet below ground. Recently, the number of children evacuated from London has reached 50,000. Five trains depart from Marylebone Station every morning, each carrying 4,000 people, mostly primary school students aged 5 to 18, accompanied by teachers, evacuating to Yorkshire. Special trains also depart from other stations, carrying batches of children to the west of England and Wales.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (German News Agency Dispatch) - A total of 133,000 women and children have been evacuated from the London area due to the German "V-1" plane attacks.</p>

<h3 id="e27">The Balkan Embroiled in War Clouds <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The war on the Eastern Front is raging from north to south like wildfire, intensifying with each passing day. The Balkans are bearing the brunt of this. One of the goals of the Soviet Red Army's summer offensive this year naturally includes the Balkans. However, the Balkans are the foundation of Germany's resistance, and for Germany, which is decisively dealing with the Allies' three-pronged offensive from the east, west, and south with a strategy of "offensive defense," the Balkans are crucial to defend. It can be said that Germany stands if the Balkans stand, and Germany falls if the Balkans fall. Precisely because of this relationship, my ears are filled with the clamor of intensified war in the north, and the shouts of battle from the east, as I hasten like the wind towards the Balkans. My destination is Romania, which is often said to be the most tense. On my journey, I certainly plan to visit Bulgaria, Hungary, Croatia, and other places, but for now, I will report on the situation in the Balkans from Bucharest, the capital of Romania.</p>
<p>The Capital in High Summer</p>
<p>During my journey across the Balkans, I was attacked by Allied aircraft more than once. At that time, I had to jump out of the train and lie down in the fields, but in the end, it was not worth being alarmed, and it did not hinder the train from continuing its journey, which made me silently thankful. Bucharest is already in the heat of high summer, and compared to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which is guarded by the Guards, the temperature difference is truly like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Since April 4th of this year, the tragedy of the large-scale bombing of Romania by British and American aircraft has been keenly felt as soon as I arrived in Bucharest at night. From the temporary tram terminal on the main street to the central tram station, a considerable distance, one had to walk slowly. Later, I squeezed onto a crowded city tram, and only because I had just a handbag in my hand was I able to get on. The hotel, which I found in the darkness due to the strict blackout, is said to be the last remaining hotel in Bucharest, but this only hotel had also been destroyed in the first bombing and had only just been restored to its former appearance two or three days ago.</p>
<p>Germany and Romania Live or Die Together</p>
<p>Romania's primary concern is opposing the Soviet Union. Therefore, Bucharest's greatest worry is when the Soviet Union will coordinate with the British and Americans to land on the coast of northern France and when the summer offensive will begin on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, the Red Army broke the long silence and launched a major offensive on June 22nd. The current center of the war is certainly in the central theater, but the Red Army in the area from the Carpathian Mountains to Bessarabia is watching with fierce eyes and eager to try. Although an active, large-scale offensive has not yet been launched there, the date when the border region will become a battlefield of earth-shattering decisive battles is undoubtedly approaching day by day. This is the focal point of attention for all people in Romania, from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Magazines and newspapers are all publishing German communiqués in a uniform manner, and are filled with reports on the situation in Normandy. Although this is enough to alarm the Romanian people, if the British and Americans do not directly attack the Balkans, Romania will still fully trust Germany's military strength. The various opinions on the country's stance cannot be fully expressed, and are merely monotonous boilerplate articles.</p>
<p>German newspapers, however, are very different from Romanian newspapers. They are not pessimistic or passive, but rather show an active trend. For example, the editorial of the German Bucharest Daily repeatedly shouted:</p>
<p>"The future destiny of Romania is not only determined by the advance of the Soviet Red Army, but also by the decisive battle in the English Channel. If the British and Americans succeed in landing in Western Europe, Romania will only be able to die together with Germany."</p>
<p>The Political Nature of the Bombing: Bucharest itself has only been bombed ten times before, but this city of one million people has already evacuated about 200,000 people, and most of the main agencies have long been dispersed to the suburbs 100 kilometers away. Among the foreign embassies, only those of Japan and Germany have not been evacuated. Romania's air defense facilities are truly dwarfed by those of Germany, so the daily spirit of the Romanian people is entirely focused on air raids. Because of this, the British and American terrorist air raids are not only limited to military targets, but also include political objectives, as can be clearly seen from their bombing methods. Since entering Romanian territory, I have seen countless devastated scenes of bombed towns and villages and stations before arriving in Bucharest. At the same time, I personally witnessed the air defense facilities in the Ploiești oilfield area on the train. What I felt particularly about that place was the political nature of the air raids.</p>
<p>The most appropriate example is the kerosene facilities in Ploiești. There, there is a complete air defense organization jointly defended by Germany and Romania. When enemy aircraft attack, they cover the entire area with the most harmful smoke screen. Although such terror is carried out, after undergoing the same ten bombings, the oil depots of the refinery area are still neatly arranged.</p>
<p>Only upon arriving in Bucharest did I learn that the actual losses of the oil field were very small. On the contrary, the American broadcast in Rome said that "the refinery was completely destroyed," which is a huge lie. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the British and Americans can truly satisfy the demands of the Soviet Union and completely destroy these facilities.</p>
<p>The Attitude of Various Countries Toward Romania</p>
<p>According to an authoritative journalist in Bucharest: "In Bucharest alone, 10,000 innocent civilians have been bombed to death. In the countryside, even working farmers, churches, and schools have been subjected to enemy air raids. The purpose of this despicable behavior is, of course, to disrupt the national spirit and make them betray and break away from the German alliance. However, the British and American air forces, very strangely, do not actively attack items prepared for resisting the Soviet Union. Currently, oil tankers heading to the Soviet front line are continuously dragging like long snake formations. Although some enemy aircraft will try to destroy the oil storage stations, this is related to the British aircraft bombing the mouth of the Danube and dropping mines into the Danube River. The purpose seems to be to hinder the transport trains heading to Germany, to weaken Germany's military strength on the Western European and Italian fronts."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether these remarks are true or not, it is worth noting that the conflict of interests between the British and Americans in the Balkans and the Soviet Union is also manifested in this point. At the same time, the different styles of the British and Americans can also be fully demonstrated here. American aircraft mainly attack during the day, often openly charging into the city airspace with large formations of three to five hundred aircraft without any hesitation. However, British aircraft often sneak into the city airspace with two or three aircraft. This proves that Britain is inhumanely unleashing the power of aircraft in Germany, but in the Balkans, it does not want to offend the masses and attempts to make the United States solely bear the people's hatred. It can truly be said that Britain's intentions are thorough. Therefore, in terms of bombing, Britain is very cunning, taking advantage of the United States' implementation of terrorist bombings to carry out the work of winning over people's hearts. In contrast to the British and Americans, the Soviet Union is not anxious, but very calm. The bombing is limited to direct combat front targets. The reason for its calm response is that Germany tightly restrains the Soviet air force and has no time to take care of other places. In terms of strength, the close cooperation between the German and Romanian armies can be seen along the railway lines, at airfields, in streets and alleys, and in rural farmhouses. This is not allowed to be swayed by the war situation or the people of Germany's mainland due to schemes.</p>
<p>Abundant Food Supply</p>
<p>What I see in the streets and alleys is the abundance of the food supply. The food served in all the restaurants surprised me, and I couldn't tell that I was eating in a country at war. The 350 grams of meat that can only be eaten once a week in Germany can be eaten in a single meal in Bucharest. Even cold rice, which is not seen at all in Germany, is readily available in Bucharest. I went to a low-class restaurant that was packed, and was even served meat soup with bones. Although household food is rationed, there is no inconvenience. Because Romania is an agricultural and livestock country, the food supply has always been abundant, whether in Bucharest or Budapest. Especially last year, due to the bumper wheat harvest, even beggars ate white bread. I had not tasted white bread for a long time, and this time I especially felt that it was delicious. But on the other hand, I felt that Germany's food supply was definitely not a problem, because it relied on Romania, so there was no need to worry about Germany. Everywhere in Bucharest, one can hear that grain production is being increased in the Balkans, and under the guidance of German technology and machinery, the harvest is becoming more and more effective.</p>
<p>The number of foodstuffs currently supplied by Romania to Germany, as well as the situation of trade, is kept secret by the authorities, and we cannot find out. However, I believe that if the eating of Romanians and Hungarians is further restricted in the future, their surplus food will definitely be abundant and sufficient to ensure Germany's wartime food policy.</p>
<p>Although living conditions have deteriorated since the war, every Romanian or Hungarian still eats at least two portions of German food.</p>
<p>Oil-Rich Country</p>
<p>Due to the conscription of tires, chauffeur-driven cars have disappeared completely in recent times, but because of the country's richness in oil, anyone with a car has been able to purchase gasoline in large quantities without restriction since the outbreak of war. In 1940, kerosene production fell to 4 million tons, but later, due to the revision of the kerosene law, the expulsion of foreign capital from Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and the adoption of German technology to reorganize various measures, the oilfield production, which had gradually shrunk since 1936, was corrected last year, and an unprecedented achievement was harvested, reaching 5.5 million tons. In the future, it is still possible to hope for further increase in production. The limit of its possibility is of course also determined by the requirements on the front line. In addition, regarding the refining capacity, it is said to be able to ensure 10 million tons, so in fact, it has not been threatened by bombers.</p>
<p>As for transportation agencies, oil pipelines have now been installed in the Danube River, and other strengthening measures have also been meticulously planned, so Germany's wartime kerosene consumption need not be worried about. If Romania's kerosene is completely monopolized by Germany in the future, its adoption capacity will also be improved. This proves that Germany's fuel problem will definitely not be affected.

<h3 id="e28">### Minister of Justice and Administration Zhang Dies of Illness in Shanghai Yesterday, Dedicated His Life to Judicial and Social Causes <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Justice and Administration Zhang Yipeng recently suffered from typhus and was treated at Fuxing Hospital. Unfortunately, due to his advanced age and frail health, his resistance was weak, and he passed away at 4:00 PM on the 15th. The passing of an elder statesman has caused grief to all who heard of it. In particular, Zhang, at the age of over seventy, took office as the Minister of Justice and Administration, and during his half-term in office, he actively promoted and gradually reorganized judicial administration. At the same time, he spared no effort to improve prisoner food, increase funding, and improve the treatment of judicial personnel and prisoners, benefiting them greatly. All these measures were sufficient to give judicial administration a new look. Alas, Heaven did not grant him many years, and he was unable to complete the entire improvement of judicial administration. Secondly, Zhang has devoted much effort to social causes in recent years, such as serving as the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association and the Chairman of the Shanghai Savings Association. Zhang also had a close relationship with this newspaper. When the late General Manager of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai, took over this newspaper in the early years of the Republic, Zhang was one of the key intermediaries. Until recently, he still served as an advisor to this newspaper. Also, Mr. Zhang served as the Director-General of the fifth session of the scholarship fund run by this newspaper, instructing everything. He personally conducted individual examinations and oral tests for university students who needed assistance, and his enthusiasm was truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>The Progression of the Illness</p>
<p>Since returning from his inspection of North China, he was quite fatigued, but because he paid too much attention to the affairs of the Ministry of Justice, he refused to rest and continued to travel between Beijing and Shanghai for official business, which mentally exhausted him. On the 24th of last month, he inspected the Shanghai Detention Center and, out of excessive concern, personally inspected the prisoner wards. Unexpectedly, he contracted fleas there and was invaded by bacteria. After returning to Beijing, he began to develop a fever on July 5th, but he still tried his best to perform his duties, disregarding the repeated勸告 of friends and family to take a break. It was not until the 8th, when his fever became too high, that he returned to Shanghai to recuperate. On the 10th, his fever increased, and his condition became serious. He was admitted to Fuxing Hospital, where Dr. Le Wenzhao diagnosed him with typhus. On the 12th, he became delirious and entered a coma. However, what he said still revolved around the affairs of the Ministry of Justice, and he did not mention family matters at all. During this period, the Japanese Embassy Office and the Naval Attaché Office dispatched renowned doctors to provide care, but ultimately, due to the excessively high fever and the deterioration of the illness, coupled with his advanced age and weak strength, he passed away at Fuxing Hospital at 4:15 PM yesterday (the 15th).</p>
<p>The Date for the Encoffining</p>
<p>Zhang's remains were transported to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road that evening. The encoffining is scheduled for 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th). As Minister, he took office on January 16th of this year. At that time, there was an arrangement that he would serve for six months, at the end of which he would retire. Unexpectedly, he continued to serve until his death, exactly six months.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography</p>
<p>Zhang was 73 years old this year, a native of Wuxian. He was a Juren in the Gui Si year of the Guangxu reign. He graduated from Tokyo Hosei University in Japan. He successively served as the Director of the Beijing Local Procuratorate, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanxi High Procuratorate, the Director of the Jiangxi Department of Finance, the President of the Pingzheng Yuan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Acting Minister, and Special Envoy for Opium Suppression. In the tenth year of the Republic, he returned to Suzhou to practice law and served as the President of the Shanghai Bar Association. He also handled local public welfare matters.

<h3 id="e31">### District Procuratorate Thoroughly Reorganizes Bailiffs <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since Mr. Zhao Zhengkai took office as the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, he has thoroughly reorganized the judicial police. Recently, it has been heard that there are still many criticisms of the judicial police. In order to thoroughly improve the situation, Chief Prosecutor Zhao has repeatedly consulted and decided to dismiss bailiffs with poor conduct. At the same time, he has formulated various binding rules for the existing bailiffs, such as prohibiting them from wearing uniforms when going out for non-official business, to avoid flaunting their status. He has also issued a notice allowing litigants to report unscrupulous bailiffs. The original text of the notice is recorded as follows: Notice is hereby given that this Procuratorate handles cases and instructs the police to handle summonses, deliveries, detentions, bails, reports, and all internal and external exhortation duties such as searches and investigations, without charging any fees. Bailiffs are also not allowed to make any demands. Notices have been issued repeatedly to make this known. However, recently, rumors have circulated that there are still a few unscrupulous police officers who disregard the prohibition and use pretexts to make demands. Such disregard for law and discipline is extremely illegal. Since taking office, this Chief Prosecutor and all colleagues have been working together to encourage each other. We deeply hope that all litigants will understand this intention. From now on, if any police officer makes things difficult for bail or following bail, or makes demands on the grounds of summoning or detaining, please immediately report or accuse them by name, or send a letter to this Chief Prosecutor, so that they can be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the law, and no leniency will be shown. This notice is hereby issued so that litigants will pay attention and not be deceived again.</p>

<h3 id="e34">### North District Security Transfer Celebratory Meeting Held Yesterday, Mayor Chen Sent a Representative to Deliver Instructions <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The special security and police work in Beiqiao in this city was transferred from the Allied Powers to our country on June 1st of this year. To commemorate this event, the District Office held a celebratory meeting at the Minhang Town Stadium in the district at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 15th). In attendance were Zhou Huarong, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner representing Mayor Chen, Chief Xiong of the Security Department representing Han Shangying, Xu Chao, the representative of the East Asia League Shanghai Branch and the Municipal Party Headquarters, the commander of the German headquarters of the Allied Powers Japan, the commander of the Kuroki Military Police, Liaison Officer Takada, Lieutenant Kuwahata, and the head of the District Office, Gong Huanfei, as well as over 15,000 people from the Self-Defense Corps, police brigade, security team, youth corps, etc., creating an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<p>Remarks by the District Head</p>
<p>The meeting began at 10:00 AM. After District Head Gong, as chairman, performed the ceremony, he delivered an opening address, which stated: "The Allied Powers have transferred the security of this district, allowing us to seek modern construction based on self-reliance, starting from the local level and expanding to the entire area, making the promises of the Allied Treaty a reality, for which we are extremely grateful. During the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan should have the spirit of sharing the same hatred. We should consciously shoulder the responsibility of consolidating the rear area's security and cooperate with Japan to complete the war. Although the security of this district has been transferred, we should humbly seek advice and carry forward the spirit of harmonious cooperation. In the future, we deeply hope that the Allied Powers will not hesitate to give us guidance on various local administrative measures."</p>
<p>Remarks by the Mayor</p>
<p>Next, Zhou Huarong, representing Mayor Chen, delivered instructions, which stated: "The Father of the Nation said that without Japan, there would be no China. Based on this statement, we can carry forward the spirit of living and dying together. Now that the Allied Powers are fighting on the front lines, we must establish security and increase production in the rear. At the beginning of this year, the Chairman told us that the three main tasks for this year are: First, to ensure security; Second, to increase production; Third, to rectify thought. Therefore, the security transfer of this district is proof of achieving the first point. After the security transfer, the administration of the Beiqiao District is entirely our own responsibility, and we must strive for progress to demonstrate the spirit of the Chinese people, and we hope that the people will stand on the same line with Japan to achieve the goal of liberating East Asia. This moral spirit, we firmly believe, will be developed from Shanghai to the whole country, from the whole country to East Asia, and is also a sign of the bright future of East Asia."</p>
<p>Remarks by the Commander</p>
<p>Subsequently, the commander of the German headquarters delivered a speech, which stated that he was sincerely pleased that the district held a celebratory meeting for the security transfer. The security transfer of this district is due to the efforts of everyone. After the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, China and Japan have reached further cooperation. The security transfer is not a sign of separation between China and Japan. Now, the security of the district must still be jointly worked on to achieve a peaceful and prosperous environment. We also hope that the security of other districts can also be ensured for transfer, which is what we expect. Subsequently, Han Shangying, Zhu Zhongxian, Lin Qing and others delivered speeches in succession, with many words of encouragement. Then, a presentation ceremony of souvenirs was held. District Head Gong presented a banner to the commander of the German headquarters, with the words "Living and Dying Together" embroidered on it. Following this was the flag-granting ceremony for the Self-Defense Corps. Everyone paid their respects to Chairman Chen, representing the Mayor, and the Allied Powers, and finally took photos and shouted slogans before dispersing.</p>

<p>In order to prevent crime and maintain local security, the Judicial District of the First Police Bureau of this city has established a crime prevention section to handle various matters such as crime prevention propaganda. However, this type of organization is the first of its kind in our country, and the public is not very clear about the meaning of crime prevention. Therefore, Director Li Shiyu will broadcast "The Meaning of Crime Prevention and the Prospects of Crime Prevention Work" from 8:45 PM to 9:00 PM tonight (the 16th) at the Shanghai Radio Station, explaining in detail the true meaning and mission of crime prevention.</p>

<h3 id="e37">### Two Companies Implement Capital Reduction to Enhance Asset Value, Increased Capital Payments to Be Returned <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Due to the prosperity of disguised investment enterprises, the stock market has declined sharply. This influence on the development of the entire industrial and commercial enterprise actually hinders the true prosperity of the entire society. Therefore, the government authorities have paid close attention to the company's content of stocks that have fallen into face value for the past few months, and will send personnel to investigate the company's organizational content, business conditions, and asset liability conditions of listed stocks. If it is verified that there are indeed listed stock assets and the business is less than the share value, the listing transaction will be immediately banned, or the business will be ordered to liquidate. Once this case is implemented, it will be able to protect the security of general shareholders. According to reporters, recently, in order to maintain credit and consider the rights of shareholders, in addition to the Right China Cheng Industrial Company's official announcement of voluntary liquidation, all stocks are recovered at face value, and now the Lianhua Real Estate Company and Lunhua Dyeing Factory, in order to reduce籌碼, increase stock prices, and protect shareholders' interests, have each decided to hold a shareholders' meeting on a scheduled date to discuss the implementation of capital reduction and the return of increased capital funds. The method of restitution is roughly to return two shares for every three shares, paid in cash, in full, based on the company's reduction of funds. The money can be used to ensure the value of the stock and demonstrate confidence in the stock value.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Review of Rice and Grain Issues in Various Regions <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Second, prevent purchasing firms from being based in rice and grain distribution centers and entering into contracts with administrative agencies. This has led to the exclusive handling of cash and goods by administrative agencies, resulting in malpractices such as farmers not receiving funds. Cash and goods should be handled exclusively by the firms themselves.</p>
<p>The existence of firms that use poor security as a reason to adopt the aforementioned methods is a fact that deserves the utmost attention. The Rice Control Association has announced that firms should handle their own purchasing, with a profit limit of one hundred yuan per shi. However, most purchasing firms sit idly by, allowing administrative agencies to contract out the purchasing activities, thereby reaping a certain profit. This is truly a foolish and thieving act that undermines the major undertaking of rice and grain control and purchasing.</p>
<p>Moreover, such unscrupulous firms often take the opportunity to undermine the corruption and insincerity within administrative organizations. They cause administrative agencies to engage in wrongdoing and shift all the painful burdens onto the farmers. Such firms should be held responsible for this crime. They are truly traitors to the war effort and the people's livelihood and should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Third, comprehensively eliminate the unscrupulous brokers of various firms. Firms should directly exchange cash and goods with farmers, eliminating all intermediary exploitation.</p>
<p>The purchasing difficulties caused by purely economic profit-seeking, stemming from the significant difference between market prices and purchasing prices, can be rectified without much difficulty. However, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of failing to compensate farmers for their supplies when market prices soar. Corrupt officials and dishonest merchants should be resolutely purged, but new principles should also be established. Firms must absolutely not exploit such unscrupulous individuals. This is, of course, the most difficult task. Overcoming this difficulty is not a technical issue but a major problem related to security, politics, and fundamental reform of purchasing. We must overcome all difficulties to pave the way for this reform; otherwise, we cannot avoid the malpractices of administrative purchasing.

Receipts for teachers and staff who have left the school should be returned and may not be collected on their behalf. The collection period is from July 17th to July 31st. Funds due to teachers and staff who have left the school will be temporarily retained by the Association and can be collected directly from the Association from September 1st to 11th.

<p>The outdoor swimming pool in Hongkou Park in this city, which has been repaired by the authorities, held its opening ceremony yesterday (the 15th) at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Chief Secretary Wu of the Municipal Government, Director Lu of the Health Department, Director Lin of the Education Bureau, Director Zhang Si of the Public Works Bureau, Section Chief Ling Da, Municipal Government official Nagai, and over a thousand other guests from various circles. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chairman Wu delivered a brief opening speech, followed by a speech by Yuan Jing, who provided a detailed account of the construction process. Ms. Wu Xinyi, daughter of Wu Song, then performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, followed by swimming competitions. The program was精彩, garnering much applause. The event concluded at 7:00 PM after Wu Song's wife presented awards, and all participants departed in high spirits.</p>
<p>Director Yuan's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman and distinguished guests: Today is the opening day of this pool. We are deeply honored by your presence. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the facilities and management of this pool to you. In previous years, this pool opened between May and June. This year, due to the intercalary fourth month in the lunar calendar, the weather has been warmer, and improvements to the pool's bottom and equipment have taken time. Therefore, the opening has been delayed until today. Swimming pool water is different from ordinary tap water. Tap water only needs to be disinfected and cleaned. However, swimming pool water, in addition to disinfection and cleaning, must also have bactericidal properties without harming the eyes and skin of swimmers. The color of the water must also be clear, and the depth must be appropriate. Regarding this method of purifying pool water, we use a filtration and disinfection method. Water is drawn from the deep end into the machine room, filtered through the device, and then sprayed into the pool from the shallow end. In between, it also needs to be disinfected with ammonia gas and mixed with other chemicals. This pool has three large filters, with a total capacity of 5,700 gallons. The filtration rate is 60,000 gallons per hour. Based on the total capacity of this pool, all the pool water can be filtered up to five times every twenty hours. Therefore, this pool can maintain the highest standard of cleanliness without the need to change the water.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Abolish the Tax Farming System <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Youmei</p>
<p>It has long been the case that our city's finances have been riddled with holes. Patching and mending them requires painstaking effort. Recently, due to blocked transportation, declining production, stagnant economic activity, and sharp decreases in local tax revenues, various expenditures have often fallen short of demand. This situation is understandable given the circumstances, and it is not surprising that those in charge are struggling to cope. However, some measures are putting the cart before the horse, or being handled improperly. It is truly not advisable for government authorities to contract out the collection of normal local taxes, thereby enriching a few individuals while reducing the revenue of the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>According to the draft budget for the 33rd fiscal year of our city, the total revenue is estimated at 260,990,374.7 yuan, with taxes and levies accounting for the largest share. Excluding special taxes and subsidies, they account for 41.5% of the total. Among the tax revenues, land tax is the largest, accounting for 40.7% of the total. The authorities have established a tax administration office and assigned personnel to collect it, with a well-developed organization, sound personnel system, and clear rewards and punishments. Those who commit fraud in the books are punished, and those who delay in paying taxes are pursued. These measures have yielded remarkable results. However, taxes on items such as tobacco and alcohol, licenses, bamboo and wood, and pigs are contracted out instead of being collected like land tax. This is a huge loss for the municipal treasury and a failure in the consideration of those in charge. According to the budget, the revenues from the aforementioned taxes account for only 8% of the total, totaling 21,045,572 yuan. This is questionable compared to the facts. To illustrate this point, the contracted amount for bamboo and wood tax alone has reached 1.8 million yuan. Are the revenues from other taxes such as tobacco and alcohol, licenses, and pigs only one-sixth of the bamboo and wood tax?</p>
<p>The tax farming system has numerous drawbacks. It is neither beneficial to the public nor harmless to the people. The Ministry of Finance issued an order in 1936 strictly prohibiting it, requiring local relevant authorities to collect and remit taxes in accordance with the actual amount collected. I accompanied my father on his official travels to a certain county government in Fujian province. At that time, the local finances were in a chaotic state. All taxes such as slaughter, business, tobacco and alcohol, and licenses were contracted out in accordance with provincial orders and established precedents, with fixed tax amounts reported and remitted monthly. When the new chief official took office, such individuals thought they could take advantage of the situation and actively sought out opportunities. As a result, letters of recommendation and introduction were flying in like snowflakes, and the door was worn through by those vying for these opportunities. Some even offered bribes or raised the contracted amount as a reward, displaying all kinds of unsightly behavior and seeking to gain power. That county was a small and remote place, with a sluggish market and limited tax revenue. Yet, the competition was so fierce. It goes without saying that Shanghai, with its thriving business and vast financial resources, is known as the land of gold.</p>
<p>Moreover, those qualified to be tax farmers are often corrupt or redundant officials who have been dismissed from public office, or local tyrants and bullies with strong connections and influence. They are obsequious to their superiors, trying their best to ingratiate themselves in order to maintain their positions. To their inferiors, they act like foxes borrowing the authority of tigers, using their usual tricks of levying exorbitant taxes and extorting money to fill their own pockets. They are willing to spend a considerable amount of money to obtain a low contracted amount, monopolizing the business and prioritizing their own interests. Their contracting methods are divided into large and small contracts. Large contractors add a significant profit margin to the contracted amount and subcontract it to several smaller contractors, thereby reaping the benefits once and for all. With a change of clothes, they become wealthy tycoons? Small contractors, due to their vested interests, aim to collect as much as possible for their own benefit, treating the citizens as 　meat to be slaughtered at will. Their monthly income is something that even high-ranking government officials cannot match. Therefore, those who obtain contracting rights cherish them as treasures. The authorities believe that the limited tax revenue is only enough to cover the collection expenses, so they prefer to contract it out. Little do they know that the actual amount collected far exceeds the contracted amount, not just by a multiple. Due to a momentary lapse in judgment, they give up unlimited rights, causing the citizens to suffer and increasing their unexpected pain. Living under such oppressive rule, they dare not be angry but dare not speak out. In these times of soaring prices and widespread poverty, if they are subjected to exploitation by those who enrich themselves at public expense, it would be like adding insult to injury, leading to immediate death.</p>
<p>The harm of tax farming is not only to the people but also to the government. If this system is not abolished, tax revenues will not be sufficient. Having taxes but not managing them, relying on tax increases is merely an empty gesture. If harmful practices are not eliminated, when can financial resources be expected to be abundant, and when can administrative efficiency be improved? Finance is the mother of all government affairs, and tax revenue is the foundation of finance. Especially during the current Great East Asia War, the security, education, construction, and material production in the rear should be actively promoted. As the economic artery and material warehouse of the country, Shanghai should prioritize these important tasks. However, these matters are significant and cannot be accomplished without sufficient funding. The source of funding is the revenue from taxes. Therefore, reforming finances is a prerequisite for increasing funding, and abolishing tax farming is the key to reforming finances. If we continue to adhere to the old system, it would not only be self-defeating but also fostering trouble, leading to endless harm. The authorities should promptly abolish the tax farming system, which has hundreds of drawbacks and not a single benefit. This would lead to a prosperous treasury and a better life for the people, benefiting everyone immensely.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Free Addiction Treatment and Moral Reform: First Phase Begins Today, Organized by Special Agreement with the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In order to support the government's anti-drug efforts, this office has made a special agreement with the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society in Yuli, Nantong Road, to organize free addiction treatment and moral reform. Priority will be given to young people with jobs for registration and group treatment. After they are freed from their suffering, they will be given moral reform so that they do not relapse. After their economic situation improves, the program will be expanded to all levels. Preparations have been underway for a month, and the number of registered participants has reached the quota. The first phase of addiction treatment is scheduled to begin today. All those who have registered for treatment with this office and the Zhongjiao Daoyi Society are requested to go to the society for treatment.</p>
<p>During the addiction treatment period, family members of the participants will not be allowed to visit freely to prevent abuse. After completing the treatment, participants must report to the center for testing once a month. If there is no relapse after three tests, a certificate will be issued as proof. Those who fail to report for testing will be considered to have relapsed and must reimburse all medical and accommodation expenses incurred during the treatment or have their guarantor 　on their behalf. All participants should pay close attention to this. However, as this is a new program, the funds are limited, and the cost of medicine is high, resulting in heavy expenses. We rely on generous donations from philanthropists to ensure that the program does not run out of funds and is not forced to be discontinued. This will not only be a source of endless gratitude for the addicts but also a great benefit to the future of society.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Seven Days in the Hospital <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Ying</p>
<p>I fear illness the most, especially when living away from home. But in the four years I've been away, I've been sick every year, and this time was the worst. The illness began with carelessness in my diet. After becoming ill, the condition deteriorated rapidly, from diarrhea to bloody diarrhea. Six or seven times a day, each time a basin full of fresh blood. I had never had this kind of illness before, so I was so frightened that I went to the doctor without delay.</p>
<p>Introduced by a friend, I came to Nanyang Hospital. The doctor who treated me was Mr. Wu Zhaoren, the most famous figure in the medical field in the country. After his examination, he determined that my illness was not internal hemorrhoids, but that stool and blood tests were needed to determine the type of dysentery. At the same time, according to Dr. Wu's suggestion, it would be best to be hospitalized. I was a little afraid of being hospitalized, because I had never been hospitalized before. At the same time, I often heard people say how snobbish people in the hospital are. The attitude of doctors, nurses, and workers towards patients depends on the patient's economic situation. And I am just a poor student, so I couldn't help but hesitate about whether or not to be hospitalized. In the end, I decided to be hospitalized, because it was really inconvenient to be sick while living in a friend's house, let alone with contagious dysentery?</p>
<p>On the first day of hospitalization, after stool and blood tests, Dr. Wu discovered that I had acute amoebic dysentery. I had to take medicine about every three hours.</p>
<p>On the second day, although there was still blood in the stool, the number of times and the amount were greatly reduced. Dr. Wu never let his assistants do the work just because he saw that my condition had improved. He still came to ask about my illness and take my pulse with a smile on his face. The nurses also took care of me often, being considerate and meticulous.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Nanqun, the director of Nanyang Hospital, is a philanthropist who is enthusiastic about social welfare. Despite running around every day and being busy with his career, he still made sure to visit the hospital every day, inspect the wards, and ask about the needs of the patients. He also often instructed the nurses and workers to provide patients with convenience and care. No wonder I gradually felt familiar after being hospitalized for two days, as if I had returned to my hometown, receiving the care of my parents, brothers, and sisters. When I saw Director Gu coming to ask about my illness, I felt as if my body had fully recovered.</p>
<p>On the third day, the bloody stools had stopped, and I began to ask to be discharged from the hospital, but Dr. Wu smiled and refused. His reason was that my bloody stools had just stopped, and my bowel movements were not healthy. At the same time, acute dysentery is often easily converted into chronic dysentery. When it comes to chronic dysentery, the disease will be _____.</p>
<p>That day passed silently. What made me feel uneasy was not that I didn't believe the doctor's words, but the burden of the daily hospitalization fees.</p>
<p>After that, my body temperature returned to normal. Whenever the nurses had free time, they would always sneak to my bedside to chat with me. There was also a Dr. Chen who sometimes came. They often told pleasant stories, so that I was not attacked by homesickness and new and old sorrows.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, I repeatedly asked to be discharged from the hospital. That day was the Dragon Boat Festival. Dr. Wu always had that amiable and pleasant face, and said kindly, "Your stool still has bacteria, don't rush to celebrate the festival!" The only reason I wanted to be discharged from the hospital was not to celebrate the festival, nor was it because I was tired of being in the hospital, but because of my financial constraints. Dr. Wu was still smiling and sincere and said, "I know, the director will help you with the hospitalization fees, because he is serving the society and seeking happiness for the public. Even my part of the treatment fee can be waived. The doctor's task and purpose is to heal people. Don't worry! As long as you get well, all problems will be easily solved." He waved his hand, indicating that he was busy seeing the second patient. I smiled silently, not knowing what to say. Gratitude! But at that time, I didn't have a word of gratitude.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, I was allowed to go out, but I was not allowed to be discharged from the hospital until after a stool test on the seventh day.</p>
<p>The nurses knew that I was about to be discharged from the hospital, so they came to tell me their names and addresses, hoping that I would come to their homes to play. Their gentle feelings made me deny the negative criticisms of nurses that I had heard in the past. The most unforgettable thing about being hospitalized for seven days was the high degree of concern, faithful diagnosis and treatment, and kind care that the director, doctors, and nurses showed to the patients.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sakura and Anchor (9)</p>
<p>Longfu quickly got drunk happily. The fact that Zhenren constantly praised the merits of the painting "Warship" further enhanced Longfu's intoxication.</p>
<p>"If I had someone in the navy, and could see things like the grand maneuvers, I think I could definitely paint a masterpiece. Like the smoke from the cannons, the trails of the torpedoes, etc., I really want to see it once. Is there no such opportunity in Kure?"</p>
<p>"Then, you need a qualification?..."</p>
<p>"That's right, I need a qualification, I really want to have one..."</p>
<p>Because he was drunk, Longfu said some things that he shouldn't have said, but Zhenren listened seriously.</p>
<p>"Anyway, tomorrow is Sunday, and I'm also on vacation, so I'll take you to the Submarine School for a tour! The school is also on vacation, but I have friends there, so a tour is possible."</p>
<p>"Submarine School? That's great! I'm very interested in submarines. But Zhenren hasn't been on a submarine yet? The warship you're serving on, isn't it a submarine?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>But this time Zhenren didn't tell the truth either.</p>
<p>In a short while, the maid brought the meal. The two finished eating, and Zhenren asked for the bill.</p>
<p>"Stay at my hotel tonight! It's still early, why don't we go to Zhongtong Avenue? It's the Ginza main street of Kure!"</p>
<p>The two stood up and walked towards the corridor. Because Longfu had already transported his luggage to Kagoshima, he only had a leather bag left, which was very convenient.</p>
<p>Just as they were walking from the corridor to the door, the door of the toilet suddenly opened, and a handsome soldier in military uniform appeared.</p>
<p>"Oh! Old Gu, it's strange to see you at the Fukuda Hotel!"</p>
<p>This was a loud voice with a slight alcoholic tone. The person was as the voice, with big, bright eyes.</p>
<p>"I just finished eating with a friend from Tokyo and was about to go back."</p>
<p>"Go back? That won't do! Old Gu comes to the Fukuda Hotel, this is the first time since the creation of the world, so saying to go back is not that easy."</p>
<p>"No, but..."</p>
<p>"No matter what, come to my room! Xintian and the others are there too!"</p>
<p>"But I have a friend..."</p>
<p>"What does it matter? I am Yuasa Chusa. Won't you come and drink together?"</p>
<p>Longfu was very embarrassed by this sudden request and was at a loss. So Zhenren introduced from the side: "He is a naval painter who has been awarded by the Minister of the Navy."</p>
<p>"A naval painter. Then, we must be together even more."</p>
