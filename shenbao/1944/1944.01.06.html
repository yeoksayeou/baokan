<p>社評</p>
<h3>爲助學金向讀者呼籲</h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金，辦理已歷五屆，現在寒假又臨，轉瞬春季始案，第六屆助學金正在開始準備。慚愧得很，我們不過替讀者諸君彙聚一筆現款，分發給申請贊助的淸寒學生，做一個居間的溝通者而已。所以，獲得助金的學生，將來學成致用，爲社會國家服務，有所貢獻，有所建樹，就是今天讀者諸君慷慨捐助的恩惠。相信讀者諸君這樣一想，必定分外感到捐款助學是多麼高興的一樁事情。</p>
<p>再從人倫情感方面想，一般人莫不愛護子弟，又莫不期待子弟好學成人。但是往往富裕之家的子弟，有的不肯求學，而貧苦之家的子弟，很多刻苦好學。前者是有力無志，後者是有志無力，可是，不論富與貧者，共父兄之愛護子弟與期待子弟的心情，是一般無二。而其結果，限於環境，有力無志者，雖能畢其學業，終見减色。有志無力者，中途失學，委棄良村，最爲可惜。在其父兄坐視子弟失學，固萬分難過，但出於人倫情感範圍尙狹，而在社會國家，坐視可造之材委棄埋沒，影響實巨。所以，我們希望富裕之家的父兄，對於子弟的觀念，從人倫情感擴展爲爲社會國家育材，從光耀門楣進而爲振興國家，然後，以愛護與期待自己子弟的熱情，展播至一般子弟，尤其是有志無力的子弟，使天資聰穎刻苦好學的貧苦之家的子弟，不致失學，皆成良材。這是多麼有意義</p>
<p>本來，這一椿工作，是由國家整個力量舉辦的，設立免費學校，使學齡兒童都有求學機會，因爲目前我們國家的財力，無法實施，所以，希望社會人士大家義不容辭的舉辦。本報發起的讀者助學金即其　端。我們巳經屢次闡釋其意義，誠摯企</p>
<p>現在第六屆已經開始準備，因爲物價的波動，助金的需要，比較上屆估計要多，上屆助學人數四千以上，助金數額一百三十餘萬元，所以，本屆我們希望籌募三百萬元爲目標，於此，我們竭誠呼籲讀者，尤其我們上面提到的富裕之家的父兄，慷慨輸助，小數歡迎，大數更歡迎，共同完成捐款目標。同時，特別向下列兩類讀者，懇切期待：</p>
<p>請求工商企業界股東會董事會諸君函，在年終結帳盈餘項下，提出一部分，捐充助學金。</p>
<p>年節甫過，春節快臨，宴聚餽贈，禮尙往還。希望讀者在預備宴聚饋贈的費用之中，提出一部分，捐充助學金。</p>
<p>我們相信在讀者讀君一念之善，捐助若干，就可以集　成　，完成目標，使淸寒靴子繼續學業，於己於人，於社會國家，交　其惠，又何樂不爲呢？</p>

<h3>日德將把握機會　以爭取最後勝利　郭培爾對日國民新歲獻辭</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　總宣傳部長郭培爾，三日於宣傳部內延見在德日本記者團，作新年對日本國民之獻詞，歷半小時之久。茲誌要旨如次：日德兩國軍隊在此次大戰緒戰期中，已獲得廣大地域，確保戰爭中所需之前提條件，兩國於戰前皆居守於狹小之地域，然為爭取戰爭勝利，始不得不將此地域擴大，在此廣大之地域內，雖亦略有後退之舉，但此絕非滅少勝利之機會。日德兩國國民將由事實决定戰局後，始談勝利，現在軸心軍已保有種種决定戰局之最後手段，此種手段或為報復攻擊，或為强化潛艇作戰，或為迎擊反軸心軍之登陸作戰等之具體方怯，固不待明言，惟日德兩國國民逢此危機，當冷靜以處，如一經打破此危機，則必獲最後之勝利無疑。</p>
<h3>今年為决戰年侵歐必予打擊</h3>
<p>又該氏更曾要請記者自由質問，茲誌其問答內容如次：（問）希特勒元首曁德國國民各指導者何以謂今年為决戰之年，（答）今年是否能决戰，專以反軸心軍之態度而定，蓋反軸心軍若於歐洲實行大規模之登陸作戰，則必將之擊潰，德軍久已備妥足以盤破反軸心軍登陸企圖之一切設施與兵力，待機而動，反軸心軍如一度於歐洲登陸失敗，則絕難彌補損失，再反攻作戰因反軸心軍不久或將實行登陸作戰，故必將展開抉戰。（問）日本國民對德軍之報復攻擊，期待頗殷，不悉尊意如何，（答）德國國民與日本國民同樣亦對此非常關懷，並極重視其進展，惟此乃軍事上之重要問題，故不能正確作答，但德軍絕非欲延宕時日，已具有於適當時期斷然實行之决心。（問）德政府對歐洲新秩序曾有何計劃，（答）德政府欲確立與亞洲相同之歐洲共榮圈，此意絕不變更，惟默洲共榮圈之內容，將以戰爭之歸趨如何而决，十九世紀乃各國民組織之時代，但二十世紀正為大陸組織之時代，故此次戰爭之重要性，即具有劃時代之意。</p>
<h3>反軸承認　未來作戰困難　直港總督對侵歐期之暗示</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　據倫敦來電，英飛機製造部長克里浦斯，曾就反軸心軍將來作戰之困難宣稱：反軸心軍將來之作戰極為危險，預想德國必將展開猛烈反攻，一九四四年不論前綫或國內，均可謂為困難之年，為克服此種困難，軍需工業工人必須倍加努力。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據此間日報駐紐約通訊員報吿稱：反軸心國之報章及廣播消息製造空氣，使世人獲得歐洲登陸作戰即將於最近之將來實現之印象，此事殊易引起誤會。首要者即登陸作戰之計劃必須完成，各方軍隊必須集台，各高級軍官亦必須赴英，再天氣情形亦須加以考慮。蓋海峽區內於近百餘年來冬季中，天氣淸亮之時問從未有出四日以外者，果於大風大霧中作戰，危險殊大，且德方可能之利用秘密武器，或將大不利於反軸心國之作戰計畫。且也全世界之人均知德方於過去三年中，已建成歐洲海岸堡壘，並有富於作戰經騐之軍隊三百餘師團，其設備及士氣均極佳，並不如一般宣傳家所云以上種種問題，均須於冒險侵歐前加以考慮也。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　海通社訊，英直布羅陀總督馬克法藍少將徵引倫敦軍界論調宣稱：義大利境內戰事在任何情形之下，均將於侵歐戰役開始時結束，如侵歐一舉定期為五月一日，則吾人於義境從事作戰之目的必能達到，馬氏最近始由倫敦返其任所。</p>
<h3>洪牙利决心　抵禦侵略</h3>
<p>布達佩斯五日中央社電　據海通社訊：洪牙利（即匈牙利）參謀部長仲巴烈中將於最近陸軍刋物上發表論文宣稱，一九四四年戰爭將入决定階段，惟此次决定僅能以酣戰得之，戰禍蔓延或將侵入洪國邊境，吾人須準備陸空兩方之可能襲擊，義大利前車可鑒，義八類付任何代價以求和平，而迄今尙未獲得，致迫而繼續作戰，吾人如存倖得和平之望，則必蹈義人覆轍，苟為事實所必需，吾人願與一切敵人相週旋。</p>
<h3>賴伐爾準備　應付事變</h3>
<p>巴黎五日中央社電　據海通社訊，「巴黎晨報」戰某通訊員報吿稱：法政府首揆賴伐爾目前之工作，為充分準備應付非常，庶幾反軸心軍登陸之行動，不至擾害法國之治安。戰事巳使賴氏遭遇困難，賴氏認為應設法防止反軸心軍登陸後法國發生內亂之情事，因此選擇達爾囊。勒慕安·及巴莽濟愛等為親信共事之人。</p>
<h3>齊托米爾區　德展開反攻　蘇軍北翼進展較速</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：齊托米爾區內激戰方酣，該區仍為東綫蘇軍進迫之重心，德軍反攻，蘇軍傷亡甚衆。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　海通社訊：伐吐丁將軍之部隊繼續猛攻，蘇軍司令部顯欲在聶伯河中部繼續進展，德軍之頑抗在南翼尤為激烈。蘇軍在貝拉耶察爾柯夫西北加薩丁以南及貝迪契夫附近推進，已於前日趨於緩和，伐吐丁將軍之北翼進展較速，先鋒已於前日進抵諾維格勒伏林斯克奧萊夫斯克之綫，蘇軍企圖自柯洛斯頓·奧萊夫斯克之綫及齊托爾諾·維格勒之綫推進，切斷德軍精銳部隊，但因德軍之彈性防禦戰術未能獲逞。維特勃斯克方面戰局無變化，蘇軍於耶誕前發動錯形攻勢業已失敗，德軍於前日反攻鉗形之西北部愈益後退，但蘇軍或再度進攻亦未可知。維特勃斯克方面之蘇軍或將移往附近戰區，試探德軍防綫之弱點，蘇軍於則夜在尼維爾西北進攻，即係此項企圖。</p>

<h3>德潛艇隊　新戰術成功</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　德潛艇隊於過雲十日音，曾擊沉反軸心軍驅逐艦二十一艘，緣德潛艇隊最近曾對反軸心軍艦艇之攻擊，採取集中攻擊戰術，由於此次所獲之戰果證之，可知此種戰術已成功。德潛艇於雲歲十二月中擊沉之反軸心軍運輸船總噸數，已較十一月增加二倍，十一月間共擊沉反軸心軍驅逐艦十艘，故反軸心軍排除潛艇威脅之企圖已被粉碎。</p>
<h3>義境德軍左翼　採拖延戰略</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　據海通社訊：義國戰局新年並無變化，敵方於十二月二十八日佔領興爾托納後，希望英第八軍右翼直驅貝斯卡拉，但成泡影。英加軍自奧爾托納北進，於最近數日與頑抗之德軍發生劇戰，德軍時常反攻，行軍以少數殿後部隊採取拖延戰略，使敵軍之進展變成　步。行軍左翼可以在福爾洛河從容佈置新防綫。英軍先鋒於前日尙未進抵距奧托納約九公哩之福爾洛河南岸，該處戰事暫趨沉寂。英第八軍中路與左翼較為活動，在米納諾至卡西諾公路以北山區局部進攻，佔領高地一處，但進展甚微。蓋塔灣沿岸，敵軍於年底企圖登陸但未成功，迦裏格里諾平原美軍陣地一處已被德軍佔領，戰况已趨沉寂</p>

<h3>德國的生產新體制</h3>
<p>— 佐竹金次中佐</p>
<p>軍需生產擴大</p>
<p>德國的軍需生產，一九四二年為四一年的平均二倍。多者也有三倍四倍。又四三年更數倍於四二年。因此，民需當然感到相當壓迫。幸而民需尙有相當積貯，軍需的壓迫民需，似尙不至於使國民生活動搖。也有人說在東部戰綫德經較蘇聯機為少，德國的飛機在該方面祗有〇個軍，所以蘇聯方面較多。這不是蘇聯的宣傳嗎？要之，為增加第一綫兵員的密度，把戰綫縮短約五六百公里。如高射砲，各飛行隊當然都有，但德國全部陸軍中，各中隊均有配備，其數量實在想像之外。又為變更飛機的種類，並未使生產停頓，在本年秋，已聽說有新種類的飛機出現。但在某程度上不必要的飛機，則停止製造。使工廠改變製造飛機的種類，毋須費上二三個月的時間，就完成了。</p>
<p>戰爭母須金錢</p>
<p>茲試考察德國生產的歷史及生產形態的本質。自一九三五年實施戈林的四年計劃以來，機構全面已經改革。這次變換中，變換的方法非常有興味。一九二七·八年時的不景氣時代，失業者達六百萬，當時產生了技術救國團體，同時，發生了希特勒的納粹運動。這納粹運動一方面是作為政治思想運動，一方面又作為陶德所指揮的技術救國團體，立即出動至第一綫。納粹黨自一九三三年掌握政權後，陶德的計劃案，作為救國的施策之一，完全付諸實施，天才的技師陶德任為工程部長，實施建築汽車專用路，建設工業，以及煤的增產，製鐵增產，水運的整備，促進第一綫的生產者的活動，使德國的生產體系成為一種正規的經營組織。之後至三八年，入蘇合德區，三九年，入波蘭後，國力愈增。這工業組綫的變換，不能不使之澈底，造成一種從人與物二方面從事生產的工業體制，與金錢無關係。要國家興隆，祗，要確立在經濟上使用人與物的生產體制已足，金錢是第二個問題。於是不能不與金錢脫離的思想，非常地濃厚起來。在戰爭中，人不足，物也不足，但在不足的情形下，使之合理的活動，則像現在這樣受金錢拘束的生產體制不行，而不能不期之於人與物。自一九三九年起，即已實施此種生產體制，去年末會見史比亞的脅助柴伐閒談時，他竭力這樣主張。「生產如委諸於生產第一綫就行。我們就在那第一綫為國家生產。假使銀行，或別的企業，對國家生產仍用舊的經濟觀念來束縛之，則我們並擬連那部份也吸收起來。」</p>
<p>去年暮史比亞就任軍需生產部長以後，經濟部長芬克就作篇軍需生產部的顧問，全面的予以實援，史比亞樹立生產計劃，經濟部畏則依此而作種種金融措置。是以現在德國並不是先有預算，根據預算而生產，乃是先有生產，然後對生產决算收支。財政部長的任務，並不在成立預算，而在决算，貫徹戰爭毋須金錢的觀念。所以曾聽得某技術研究者說：德國在四五年前研究員還受研究費的分配。怎樣使用那分配的研究費，須費上一番心思，現在那就不必了。當研究某一問題，如要求必要的材料，就完全勝買，沒有考慮要費多少金錢的餘地，因為金錢沒有關係。這樣，研究者無所謂研究預算，祇有指定研究的問題及所必要的資材之分配。</p>
<p>研究所為企業的主體</p>
<p>這樣說來，所謂企業者，亦成為生產第一主義。企業形態以研究所為主體。研究所的有力者，即為那企業的經營者。茲試就某稱企業來說，如其沒有熟悉從學術的到生產的一切情形的人，指導那種工業的生產，則最新的技術，不能在最短的時間內，完成其生產。所以生產上所需的經費及其他並無關係，政府發出獲造這東西的命令的場合，從有關的研究起，以至於必要的材料，大量生產的工程止，從計劃起到寶行止，所須要的經費都由政府支出。至於從資本方面說，如製造那東西，能不能賺錢，那不必說，也沒有說的必要。所需要的研究費及其他一切，殆全部由政府負擔，經營者祇須大農生產，不必顧及其他。對投下的資本政府保證四五分紅利利息。對是對資本，對企業別無容納之餘地。是以生產突飛猛晋，且有着非常的彈力性，而日趨强化中（翔：譯自十二月一日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>美不承認玻新政府　廣田部長談話　事實表現東亞政策眞面目</h3>
<p>中央社訊　美國政府以阿根廷政府業已承認去年十二月二十日新成立之玻利維亞政府，爰指示美國所領導之美大陸防衛委員會，在未得美大陸諸國互相協議，即通過以該委員會名義，不承認玻利維亞新政府，波利維亞新政府鑒於美國此種態度，以美國毫無理由，且未經全體美洲諸國通過而不承認合法成立之政府，是為對於弱小國家之苛烈壓迫，提出嚴重抗議。上海日大使館事務所廣田情報部長，對此事特發表談話，斷定此為明白表現美國對於他國干涉內政之政策，並事實表示美國之對華政策，及東亞政策之眞面目。</p>
<p>注意兩點</p>
<p>廣田部長稱：吾人對於美國以美大陸防衛委員會名義，對該利維亞新政府採取之措置，應有兩點，須加注意，即：　玻利維亞新政府，係反對舊政府與美國政府問保持之經濟關係，有遠反國家利益而成立者。故美國政府對之加以壓迫，其不能表示承認之動機，是基於利害關係，此為衆所料及者。　美大陸防衛委員會，係根據泛美同盟而成立者，但該委員會在美國領導下，以多數而干涉一國之內政，此種事實，可以表示美國現在提倡之維持和平機構，與國際聯盟，有異曲同工之妙，其機能究屬如何，徴諸美國此次干涉玻利維亞，即可彰彰明甚，以上兩點，吾人不能忽略。</p>
<p>經濟壓迫</p>
<p>又最近阿根廷勒米萊斯總統，推行革新政策，解散國內各政黨，倫敦泰晤士報及紐約時報兩英美代表報紙，竟批評此為野蠻的行為，蓋勒米萊斯政府於去年推翻無力內閣，組織强力之全體政府，對此次世界戰爭，仍以民族的立場，嚴守中立政策，但美國企國將阿根廷牽入反軸心陣綫，施展種種經濟壓迫，惟均吿失敗。美國之外交壓迫，例如對於金融貿易等經濟問題之壓迫，（美國已禁止對阿輸出），以及此次利用阿國內腐敗份予，為美國之故伎，因是勒米萊斯總統大刀闊斧，肅淸國內腐敗份子，英美興論，且為野鐵行為，固宜也</p>
<p>逞其私慾</p>
<p>由於上述事實，可以看出英美之全權主義者，常希圖利用他國政治上之不安定及不健全，以逞其私慾。彼等每支持對彼等自身資本有利之政機，利用該政權對其國民榨取，故他國自不安定不健全之政治走上軌道時，即彼等即視為一種野蠻行為，一心一意，希望弱小國家內部分裂崩潰，以至隸屬於彼等之下，始稱快事。英美資本帝國主義之世界政策如何，又英美之所稱為善鄰政策之南美政策，其內容又如何，固極屬明瞭，由此亦可檢討認識彼等對華政策及東亞政策之內容，果為如何云。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>三論消費特稅</h3>
<p>我們對於戰時消費特境，已經討論過兩次了。現在不憚煩複，願再評論一下：</p>
<p>查消費稅可分為兩種：一係先由商人付納，再由其轉嫁於最後的消費者，這呌做問接消費稅，如關稅·鹽稅·及統稅等是；一係直接由最後的消費者隨購用行為，連同發票或帳單，先付與商人，再由其彙繳公家金庫，這呌做直接消費稅，如零售捐·帳單捐·及筵席捐等是。前者在物價上之作用為抬高售價，而且政府的用意亦正是如此。後者在物價上之作用，理應毫無影響，不過消費者於巿面售價以外，尙須多納消費特稅而已。</p>
<p>此次政府為籌集戰時軍政經費，已次定於本月十六日開征戰時消費特稅，非辦法實為過去一二年來本巿二厘貨物零售捐之擴大，故完全為直接消費稅，對於物價，理應毫無高抬的影響，不意商人多又乘機狂抬物價，不顧公衆生計，實堪痛恨。按財部擬案中之稅率，僅為四厘，而報章最初依據通訊社消息，竟有誤為四成者，遂使人心惶惶，羣起購物，商人則從中攫取暴利，惟恐不速；通訊社當時訪稿，容或偶有一字之差，奈何一般不顧商人道德者，以訛傳訛，藉口抬價，至於如此之甚，如此之速！新年開始以後，當局亟宜有所料正之，以安民生。</p>
<h3>紗布價額存單　轉讓或押款　財部委託中儲行審辦並指定十家銀行承受</h3>
<p>政府收買棉紗棉布之價額，一律付給中央儲備銀行上海分行之特別定期存單，而該存單之轉讓或押款，須經財政部許可始能辦理，關於辦理許可手續，財部已委託中央儲備銀行代為執行，聞中儲上海分行，為憐重審核起見，特設「收買棉紗棉布特別傳單資金融通審查委員會」，對於申請轉讓或押款者，事實上是否出於必要，須經該會詳細檢查，然後决定其可否，又以該項傳單可作貸款之擔保品，為防止隨便輾轉收受諸流弊起見，嚴藥各銀行錢莊不得輕易承做，特由中央儲備銀行指定十家銀行，（中國交通華興商業金城鹽業大陸中南浙江興業浙江實榮上海商業等銀行），按照規定頒布辦法辦理云。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>靑春（十）</p>
<p>期考也平安無事地過去了。英語和數學，眞人自信有很好的成績。日文和漢文，雖然是不得意的功課，自己也以爲取得了普通的分數。只是音樂這科目，是束手無策的。聲音雖是那樣的美麗。但是，從小學以來。朱曾得到過如意的分數。</p>
<p>考試完了那天，出了吿示。說：河田校長有談話，一年級學生都要聚集到大購堂去。帽子上罩着白帽套的學生們，陸陸續續的進了大講堂。不和校舍在一起的大　堂裏，充滿着靜寂的淸潔的空氣。正面雪白的壁上，輝煌着菊花的皇室紋章。每個學生在門口脫帽致最敬禮。河田校長的魁偉的巨軀，深深地躬着腰站在講壇上。</p>
<p>「今天講話的題目，是關於海軍前輩中原猶介。諸君想都知道，我們校庭裏堅着的那個碑文……。」</p>
<p>一年級的學生們都互相瞧着。誰都和隆央一樣，沒有注意到那碑文的存在。</p>
<p>「正在那碑文的地方，有一所公館，天保三年四月八日，在那兒誕生了的鐵心齋中原猶介。……」</p>
<p>校長的講話，大約經過了一小時，他所說的話簡括地說起來，猶介是一位科學家，敎育家，又是一位勇敢的軍人。十八歲就在長崎研究蘭學，（荷蘭學術輸入日本最早普通稱爲關團—譯者註）二十二歲經藩公齊彬的許可，担任蘇摩水軍造兵器造船造機械等職，獻身於近代海軍的創設。他眞正是一位憂國之士，深悉對於將來時代的戰爭，國家和藩府所缺少的東西是什麼，和固　的思想奮鬥着，現在目本海軍所以能在世界上誇示着旺盛的精神力和卓越的科學上的優秀性，正是中原對介所夢想的。</p>
<p>猶介留學江戶，人江川太郎左衛門和安井息軒門下，但在安井私塾時，適値薩摩的蒸汽軍艦進了品川港。朝野上下的參觀者環列如堵之中，息軒也由猶介的經導到艦內參觀了一遍·猶介對那眾艦是自己建造的事，一點也沒對老師提到。後得　那事實之後，息軒拍膝，盛讃猶介的爲道稱謙恭的性質，後來被東鄕兀帥承　着也可以銳是一種鄕土精神。</p>
<p>猶介製造了日本最初的機械水雷，以備薩英戰爭。同時是砲術的大家，所以在烏羽伏見戰爭時曾出戰被新政府任爲海軍參謀。更在應援北陸之役，與河井繼之助對陣時，右腿被敵彈擊中，因此結束了三十七年的生活。他的末日也和當人不同，像那樣信仰科學的習慣，知道這是天命，拒絕了一切的醫業和治療—眞人目不轉睛的靜聽着講話。</p>

<h3>Appealing to Readers for Scholarship Aid</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's scholarship aid for readers has been in operation for five sessions. Now that winter vacation is approaching again, and the spring semester is about to begin in a blink of an eye, preparations for the sixth scholarship session are underway. We are very ashamed, as we are merely gathering a sum of money from our readers and distributing it to impoverished students who apply for assistance, acting only as an intermediary. Therefore, the students who receive aid, when they complete their studies and apply their knowledge to serve society and the country, making contributions and achievements, will be thanks to the kindness of the generous donations of our readers today. We believe that if our readers think this way, they will surely feel extra glad that donating to support education is such a happy thing.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the perspective of human emotions, everyone loves and cares for their children, and everyone hopes that their children will study hard and become accomplished adults. However, it is often the case that children from wealthy families are unwilling to study, while children from poor families often study diligently. The former have the means but lack the will, while the latter have the will but lack the means. However, regardless of wealth or poverty, the feelings of parents towards their children, their love and expectations, are generally the same. But as a result, limited by circumstances, those with the means but lacking the will, even if they complete their studies, will ultimately be less successful. Those with the will but lacking the means, dropping out of school halfway through, abandoning promising potential, is most regrettable. It is certainly very distressing for parents to helplessly watch their children drop out of school, but this is limited to a narrow scope of human emotion. In society and the country, watching potentially valuable talent be abandoned and buried has a huge impact. Therefore, we hope that parents of wealthy families will expand their concept of children from human emotions to nurturing talent for society and the country, from glorifying the family to revitalizing the nation. Then, with the same enthusiasm for loving and expecting their own children, extend this care to all children, especially those with the will but lacking the means, so that the children of poor families who are intelligent, diligent, and eager to learn will not drop out of school and all become valuable talents. How meaningful this is.</p>
<p>Originally, this work should be carried out by the entire strength of the nation, establishing free schools so that all school-age children have the opportunity to study. However, because our country's financial resources are currently unable to implement this, we hope that people from all walks of life will undertake it as a matter of duty. The reader scholarship fund initiated by our newspaper is one example. We have repeatedly explained its significance, sincerely looking forward to</p>
<p>Now preparations for the sixth session have begun. Due to fluctuations in commodity prices, the need for scholarships is estimated to be greater than in the previous session. In the previous session, the number of students assisted was over 4,000, and the amount of aid was over 1.3 million yuan. Therefore, for this session, we hope to raise 3 million yuan as our goal. Here, we sincerely appeal to our readers, especially the parents of wealthy families mentioned above, to generously donate, whether it be a small amount or a large amount, to jointly achieve the donation goal. At the same time, we especially look forward to the following two types of readers:</p>
<p>We request that shareholders and directors of industrial and commercial enterprises contribute a portion of their year-end surplus to the scholarship fund.</p>
<p>The New Year has just passed, and the Spring Festival is approaching. There are banquets, gatherings, gifts, and reciprocal exchanges. We hope that readers can contribute a portion of the expenses prepared for banquets and gifts to the scholarship fund.</p>
<p>We believe that with a single good thought from our readers, donating a certain amount can add up and achieve the goal, allowing impoverished students to continue their studies, benefiting themselves, others, society, and the country. What could be more enjoyable?</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Bi Richen Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting Various Parts of South China: Strong Air Defense Positions and Excellent Public Security</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Army in China Dispatch Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 5th that Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China dispatched forces went to South China to inspect from December 24th of last year to the 3rd of this month, and returned to Nanjing after completing his official duties, issuing the following statement: During my inspection of South China, I witnessed the high morale of the officers and soldiers stationed in various places, overcoming all difficulties, and focusing solely on striving to complete the war. In particular, our Air Force, which previously attacked the enemy's inland areas and achieved great results, has a very high spirit. Moreover, in the frontline areas of air defense, the military and civilians are extremely thorough in their air defense countermeasures, establishing strong air defense positions to crush any attempted enemy movements. I am deeply impressed. The public security situation in various places has recently improved significantly due to the penetration of the political power of the three provincial governments. The provincial governments' industrial construction plans are also achieving effective results. In addition, due to last year's bumper harvest, the people's morale is becoming more stable. What I particularly welcome is that Chinese officials in the rear are gradually making progress in their cooperation with the Japanese side, thereby making the relationship between China and Japan more perfect, and the construction of a peaceful and happy land is deeply gratifying. Furthermore, while in Hong Kong, I had a sincere conversation with Governor Isoya. Hong Kong is no longer what it used to be, and it has an inseparable relationship with Guangzhou in terms of food supply and other economic aspects. This is truly due to the good handling of the overall situation by the local authorities, and I am deeply impressed by this. Moreover, during the inspection period, the opening ceremony of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was held. The railway was destroyed by the British army when the Greater East Asia War broke out, but it has now been repaired by the Japanese army. This will make a significant contribution to the transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, as well as the public security and economy of the areas along the railway. I am truly delighted about this from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<h3>War Results Achieved by the Japanese Army in the Taiyue Mountains Area; Japanese Army's Victory Report in Southern Hebei</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 5th (Central News Agency) — The main operations of the Japanese army against the Communist army in the Taiyue Mountains area in late December are as follows: A certain unit of the Japanese army, from December 27th to 30th, launched a fierce attack on about 1,000 defeated and remnant Communist bandits in the Taiyue area, defeating them. The war results achieved in this campaign included 118 enemy soldiers killed, 25 captured, and the seizure of one light machine gun, two grenade launchers, 39 rifles, and 21 pistols. A unit of the Japanese army and the Gaoping County Security Team discovered about 200 Communist bandits from the 2nd Regiment of the Newly Organized 1st Brigade near Zhongcun, 10 kilometers north of Gaoping, on the morning of the 30th, and bravely engaged them, inflicting heavy damage. It is estimated that 30 soldiers were killed, 15 captured, and one mortar and ten shells seized.</p>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 5th (Central News Agency) — A certain unit of the Japanese army in North China has been carrying out suppression operations against the remaining guerrillas in the central and southern parts of Hebei Province since the last ten days of December last year.

<h3>Ministry of Propaganda Examination Committee Holds Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Ministry of Propaganda's recruitment examination for five Japanese news trainees has already closed.

Vice Minister Guo attended in person to give instructions, and the Japanese Embassy also sent personnel to participate. It is reported that the recruitment examination is being conducted with extremely strict security measures, and the grading of the papers is done anonymously. The examination questions are also not pre-printed to prevent malfeasance. As for the examination location, it was originally planned to borrow the Central Cadre School, but for convenience, it has been changed to the fifth floor of the ministry.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Broadcast for Youths in the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — The Capital Youth and Student Anti-Drug Movement Headquarters began its anti-drug broadcast yesterday (the 5th). It will be broadcast simultaneously on the Central Broadcasting Station and local stations from 7:10 PM to 7:30 PM every day for eight consecutive days. It is reported that after the broadcast ends, they will prepare to stage the play "Ten Thousand Ages of Glory" to invite people from all walks of life, so that the anti-drug movement can deeply penetrate the people.</p>
<p>Bengbu, 5th (Central News Agency) — Youth and students in the capital of Anhui Province have decided to respond to the anti-drug movement in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places by forming groups to carry out vigorous propaganda and persuade citizens to eradicate bad habits. Local opium dens and smoking establishments have heard the news and are awakening, and will voluntarily close down.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department Actively Adjusts Tax Revenue; Has Been Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — In order to adjust tax revenue and replenish the national treasury, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance is actively adjusting various tax rates and increasing valuations. It has specially instructed all subordinate tax authorities to change the collection method for rectified spirits and beer from quantity-based to value-based, and to change the tax for soda water to a beverage tax, including soda, fruit juice, etc., all collected value-based. The tax rate for foreign wines and other taxes has been increased, and the valuation for domestic tobacco and smoked tobacco has been increased. This proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo's Vice Minister of Economy Discusses Resource Production Increase This Year</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 5th (Central News Agency) — Aomoki, Vice Minister of Economy of Manchukuo, stated the following on the 4th regarding the issue of increasing production of coal, copper, and light metals, which are important resources in Manchukuo this year: (Coal) Judging from the equipment capacity of coal mines across the country this year, a considerable amount of production increase is possible. In the first half of each year, labor shortages often affect the success or failure of operations. This year, in order to prevent low production in the first half, special countermeasures are being planned to ensure average production throughout the year. (Copper) As a result of the establishment of the production increase period and the implementation of the subsidy policy in the tenth year of Kangde, copper mines have increased production several times compared to the ninth year of Kangde. It is predicted that the production increase target will be approached by March of this year. (Light metals) The production increase plan related to light metals has received full assistance from the Japanese government and will also achieve satisfactory results. In addition, concrete measures have been gradually decided upon regarding the implementation methods.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilians Unite as One; Japan Actively Increases Aircraft Production; Lieutenant General Endo Expresses Ardent Beliefs</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) — Lieutenant General Endo Saburo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, recently met with reporters to express his ardent beliefs regarding the urgent increase in production and answered reporters' questions, pointing out that Japan has now reorganized the basic situation for increasing aircraft production several times. The question and answer are recorded as follows: (Question) May I ask what your opinions are on the urgent task of urgently increasing aircraft production? (Answer) The enemy's attempt to counterattack will determine the outcome in the short term, and this ambition has become increasingly blatant recently. This year is truly the year for us to repel the enemy's general counterattack and strive for final victory. Therefore, rapidly increasing aviation combat power and actively building aircraft are the first prerequisite for winning victory. The aircraft production plan for the third year of the decisive battle has been decided to increase production several times to meet the country's definite requirements. Whether this can be realized is enough to determine the country's fate. Therefore, we must overcome all difficulties and realize this production increase plan. (Question) Has the increase in aircraft production been proceeding smoothly since the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions to supervise the aircraft industry and the establishment of emergency production countermeasures for aircraft? (Answer) After the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions to supervise the aircraft industry, the cooperative momentum of military and civilians has been established, and they have now become one. Great results have been achieved since the promotion of emergency production for rapidly increasing aircraft production. (Question) What about the establishment of mass production methods, the open exchange of technology, and the unification of machinery? (Answer) The aircraft industry is the most comprehensive industry. In order to complete the mass production plan, it is necessary to establish comprehensive countermeasures, and to balance the vertical relationship between aircraft factories and cooperative factories and the horizontal relationship between light metals, steel, and other related industries, so as to prepare and establish the aircraft production increase plan. Regarding this point, we are now focusing on preparing enterprises in the second industrial sector, implementing strong measures such as adjusting the enterprise system, and gradually establishing mass production methods on this basis. Future production increase is extremely promising. At the same time, the open exchange of production technology among companies and factories has been gradually promoted due to the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. The unification of parts and machinery, the unification of aircraft models and mounted weapons are prerequisites for mass production, so we should strive to achieve them. (Question) In order to increase aircraft production several times, the two-shift and three-shift systems are currently adopted, and new workers and newly drafted workers have increased sharply. Is the importance of labor management becoming increasingly important? (Answer) Regarding manpower, our country still has a very large surplus. The government's policy is to rapidly and strongly promote the national civilian combat deployment to ensure the absolute amount of labor required to increase aircraft production several times. I believe that if we analyze the production process, improve the project, and manage new workers and female workers to fully exert their production efficiency, in short, the basic situation for urgently producing aircraft has been rapidly prepared and has been largely completed. There will still be many difficulties in the future, but whether it is from the perspective of materials or human resources, it is extremely likely</p>
<h3>Sinking of U.S. Ship "Turner" Confirmed; Seventy Crew Members Killed</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Washington news: The U.S. destroyer that exploded and sank in New York Harbor on Monday has now been confirmed as the new 1,700-ton "Turner." The ship had a crew of approximately 230, only 152 and two officers were rescued, and the captain has been killed.</p>
<h3>Polish Government-in-Exile Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, London news: The Polish government-in-exile in London, chaired by Prime Minister Mikolajczyk, held a meeting yesterday. Polish people attach great importance to this cabinet meeting in view of the development of the war situation on the Eastern Front. It is said that the government-in-exile will issue a document on Polish-Soviet relations in the short term.</p>
<p>Bern, 5th (Central News Agency) — A representative of the Polish side in London told a special correspondent of the Swedish Telegram Bureau: Although the Soviet-Polish issue was discussed at the Tehran Conference, a solution has not yet been reached. The Soviet Union insists on changing the borders stipulated in the Riga Treaty regarding the Polish issue. Regarding the attitude of the Polish government-in-exile, it is extremely willing to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union and maintain friendship, so it is willing to leave the border issue to be resolved at the peace conference. The current Polish government is in exile abroad and cannot have the right to agree to modify the borders, because it cannot consult with the Polish people.</p>

<h3>Germany and Japan Will Seize Opportunities to Strive for Final Victory; Goebbels' New Year's Message to the Japanese People</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Minister of Propaganda Goebbels met with the Japanese press corps in Germany on the 3rd and gave a New Year's message to the Japanese people, lasting half an hour. The main points are recorded as follows: The armies of Japan and Germany have gained vast territories during the initial stages of this war, ensuring the prerequisites needed for the war. Both countries lived in small areas before the war, but in order to strive for victory in the war, they had to expand these areas. Although there have been slight retreats within this vast territory, this does not diminish the chances of victory. The people of Japan and Germany will decide on victory after the facts determine the war situation. The Axis powers now possess various final means to determine the war situation. These means may be retaliatory attacks, strengthened submarine warfare, or concrete ways to repel the landing operations of the anti-Axis forces, which need not be stated explicitly. However, the people of Japan and Germany should remain calm in the face of this crisis. Once this crisis is overcome, there is no doubt that they will achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>This Year is the Year of Decisive Battle, Invasion of Europe Will Be Repelled</h3>
<p>The same person asked the reporters to ask questions freely. The contents of the questions and answers are recorded as follows: (Question) Why do Hitler and the leaders of the German people say that this year is the year of decisive battle? (Answer) Whether this year can be a decisive battle depends entirely on the attitude of the anti-Axis forces. If the anti-Axis forces carry out large-scale landing operations in Europe, they will definitely be repelled. The German army has long prepared all facilities and troops to break the anti-Axis forces' landing attempt, waiting for the opportunity to move. If the anti-Axis forces fail to land in Europe once, it will be difficult to make up for the losses. The anti-Axis forces will soon carry out landing operations, so they will inevitably launch a decisive battle. (Question) The Japanese people have high expectations for the German army's retaliatory attacks. What is your opinion? (Answer) The German people, like the Japanese people, are also very concerned about this and attach great importance to its progress. However, this is an important military issue, so it cannot be answered accurately. However, the German army does not want to delay, and has the determination to resolutely implement it at the appropriate time. (Question) What plans does the German government have for the new European order? (Answer) The German government wants to establish a European co-prosperity sphere similar to Asia. This intention will never change. However, the content of the European co-prosperity sphere will depend on the outcome of the war. The nineteenth century was the era of national organizations, but the twentieth century is the era of continental organizations. Therefore, the importance of this war is epoch-making.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Powers Acknowledge Future Operations Will Be Difficult; Governor of Gibraltar Hints at the Invasion of Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to a London dispatch, British Aircraft Production Minister Cripps stated regarding the difficulties of the anti-Axis forces' future operations: The anti-Axis forces' future operations are extremely dangerous. It is expected that Germany will launch a fierce counterattack. 1944 can be said to be a difficult year both on the front lines and at home. To overcome these difficulties, workers in the military industry must work even harder.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) — German News Agency reports that the newspaper correspondent stationed in New York reports that the newspapers and broadcast messages of the anti-Axis countries are creating an atmosphere that gives the world the impression that the landing operation in Europe will be realized in the near future, which is easily misleading. The most important thing is that the landing operation plan must be completed, the troops must be assembled, the senior officers must also go to England, and the weather conditions must also be considered. In the strait area, in the past hundred years, the clear weather in winter has never lasted more than four days. If the battle is fought in strong winds and heavy fog, the danger is great, and the German side's possible use of secret weapons may be greatly detrimental to the anti-Axis countries' operation plan. And everyone in the world knows that the German side has built a European coastal fortress in the past three years, and has more than three hundred divisions of troops with rich combat experience, whose equipment and morale are excellent, and are not as claimed by ordinary propagandists. All of the above problems must be considered before risking an invasion of Europe.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, British Gibraltar Governor Major General Macfarlane cited London military circles' arguments, claiming that the war in Italy will end under any circumstances when the invasion of Europe begins. If the invasion of Europe is scheduled for May 1, then our goal of engaging in combat in Italy must be achieved. Macfarlane recently returned to his post from London.</p>
<h3>Hungary Determined to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Budapest, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, Hungarian (i.e., Hungarian) Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Zhongbalai stated in a recent article published in the military journal that the war in 1944 will enter a decisive stage, but this decision can only be obtained by fierce fighting. The war may spread and invade the Hungarian border. We must prepare for possible attacks by land and air. Italy's past experience is a lesson to be learned. Italy paid any price to seek peace, but has not yet obtained it, forcing it to continue fighting. If we harbor hope for peace, we will follow in the footsteps of the Italians. If it is necessary in fact, we are willing to fight with all enemies.</p>
<h3>Laval Prepares to Cope with Contingencies</h3>
<p>Paris, 5th (Central News Agency) — According to Reuters, a correspondent of "Paris Morning News" reported that the current work of French government leader Laval is to fully prepare to cope with emergencies, so that the actions of the anti-Axis forces will not disturb the治安 of France. The war has caused Laval difficulties. Laval believes that measures should be taken to prevent internal disturbances in France after the anti-Axis forces land, so he chose Darnand. Le Moine and Barmansieux as trusted collaborators.</p>
<h3>Germans Launch Counterattack in Zhitomir Area; Soviet Troops Advance Faster on the Northern Flank</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Reuters: Fierce fighting is underway in the Zhitomir area, which remains the focus of the Soviet army's advance on the Eastern Front. The German counterattack has caused heavy casualties to the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) — Reuters: General Vatutin's troops continue to attack fiercely. The Soviet command obviously wants to continue to advance in the middle of the Dnieper River. German resistance is particularly fierce on the southern flank. The Soviet army's advance northwest of Belaya Tserkov, south of Kazatin, and near Berdichev has slowed down since the previous day. The northern flank of General Vatutin's advance is faster. The vanguard had advanced to the line of Novograd-Volynsky-Olevsk by the previous day. The Soviet army attempted to cut off the elite German troops by advancing from the line of Korosten-Olevsk and the line of Zhytomyr-Novograd-Volynsky, but failed due to the German army's elastic defense tactics. There is no change in the war situation in the Vitebsk area. The Soviet army's pincer offensive launched before Christmas has failed. The German army has been retreating further and further from the northwest of the pincer on the previous day, but it is also possible that the Soviet army will attack again. The Soviet army in the Vitebsk area may move to nearby war zones to test the weaknesses of the German defense line. The Soviet army's attack northwest of Nevel on the night of the previous day was this attempt.</p>

<h3>Great East Asia Museum to be Built in Japan, Initial Budget Set at 6 Million Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japan Museum Association, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Education, and other cultural and academic organizations, in commemoration of the great achievements of the construction of Greater East Asia, previously planned to build the "Great East Asia Museum." This plan has now been concretized following the Greater East Asia Conference. The motivation for building the Great East Asia Museum stems from the recognition of the necessity to thoroughly investigate, research, and understand the natural resources, politics, economy, culture, etc., of various parts of Greater East Asia. Therefore, establishing the Great East Asia Museum is a matter of utmost urgency. Now, with complete consensus among all parties, it has been decided that the initial budget will be 6 million yen. It will be built near Tokyo over a period of three years. The Minister of Education will serve as the chairman of the committee, and thirty leading figures from the academic world will be selected as committee members. An office will be established within the Ministry of Education. The museum will have the following purposes: 1. To exhibit materials; 2. To conduct specialized research; 3. To carry out enlightenment work. Upon completion, it will be the largest academic hall in Greater East Asia. Initially, academic survey teams will be dispatched to various parts of Greater East Asia to collect materials, requesting the cooperation of the relevant authorities in those areas to ensure a comprehensive collection. Before the museum is completed, the collected materials will be entrusted to the Japan Science Museum, the Institute for Research in Science Resources, and various government-run research institutions and schools for preservation, organization, and exhibition. Furthermore, to ensure that the museum becomes the world's leading research institution, upon its completion, all government and private research institutes will be placed under its jurisdiction to conduct comprehensive research. The research results will be published to the world in the form of academic reports, explanatory documents, illustrated books, postcards, etc., for the reference of those engaged in enlightenment education. After the exhibition halls are completed, film screenings and photo exhibitions will be held, and lending and traveling exhibitions will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Reshuffle of U.S. Navy Admirals</h3>
<p>Argentina's Capital City, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced today that Vice Admiral Greenslade will retire on February 1st. His successors will be Rear Admiral Bagley, who will become Commander of the Western Seaboard Defense, and Rear Admiral Wright, who will become Commander of the 12th Naval District. Brigadier General Burke of the U.S. Marine Corps will be promoted to Major General and will succeed Major General Luke as Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps.</p>
<h3>Success of New Tactics by German Submarine Force</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - In the past ten days, German submarines have sunk twenty-one anti-Axis destroyers. Recently, the German submarine force has adopted concentrated attack tactics against anti-Axis warships. The results obtained this time prove that this tactic has been successful. The total tonnage of anti-Axis transport ships sunk by German submarines in mid-December has increased twofold compared to November. In November, a total of ten anti-Axis destroyers were sunk. Therefore, the anti-Axis attempt to eliminate the submarine threat has been shattered.</p>
<h3>German Left Wing in Italy Adopts Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, the situation in the Italian theater has not changed in the new year. After occupying Ortona on December 28th, the enemy hoped that the right wing of the British Eighth Army would drive straight to Pescara, but this proved to be a pipe dream. The British and Canadian forces advanced north from Ortona and have recently engaged in fierce battles with the resisting German forces. The German forces frequently counterattack, and the advancing troops are using a small number of rear guard units to adopt delaying tactics, causing the enemy's advance to become slow. The advancing troops' left wing can calmly set up a new defensive line along the Foro River. The vanguard of the British forces had not yet reached the south bank of the Foro River, about nine kilometers from Ortona, the day before yesterday, and the fighting there has temporarily subsided. The central and left wings of the British Eighth Army are more active, launching local attacks in the mountainous area north of the Minano-Cassino highway, occupying a high ground, but making little progress. Along the Gulf of Gaeta, the enemy attempted to land at the end of the year but failed. A U.S. position on the Garigliano Plain has been occupied by German forces, and the fighting has become quiet.</p>
<p>Italian Cities Repeatedly Raided</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, although the town of Pistoia in the Apennines has no military targets, anti-Axis aircraft bombed it fiercely on Monday, and residential areas were bombed, causing many civilian casualties. Many historical buildings in the cathedral area were also repeatedly bombed, and the cathedral itself, a 12th-century building, was also severely damaged. Various parts of the Italian Riviera were also raided, and residential areas in the border town of Ventimiglia, as well as Turin and Terni, were bombed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Establish Commission to Study Post-War Problems</h3>
<p>Geneva, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, citing London reports, the Soviet Union is about to establish a special commission to advise Stalin on matters related to post-war political and economic cooperation in Europe. The chairmanship is expected to be assumed by the former Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, with the former Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, as his representative.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Appoints Envoy to Japan</h3>

<h3>Germany's New Production System</h3>
<p>— Lieutenant Colonel Kinji Satake</p>
<p>Expansion of Military Production</p>
<p>Germany's military production in 1942 was twice the average of 1941. Some were even three or four times higher. Moreover, in 1943, it was several times higher than in 1942. As a result, civilian needs were naturally under considerable pressure. Fortunately, there were considerable reserves of civilian goods, and the military's pressure on civilian needs did not seem to shake the national livelihood. Some say that the German equipment on the Eastern Front was less than that of the Soviet Union, and that German aircraft had only a few units there, so the Soviet side had more. Is this not Soviet propaganda? In short, in order to increase the density of personnel on the front line, the front line was shortened by about five or six hundred kilometers. Regarding anti-aircraft guns, each air squadron certainly had them, but in the entire German army, each company was equipped with them, and the number was truly beyond imagination. Also, in order to change the types of aircraft, production was not halted. This autumn, it was said that new types of aircraft had appeared. But to some extent, unnecessary aircraft were stopped from being manufactured. Changing the type of aircraft manufactured by a factory was completed without taking two or three months.</p>
<p>War Does Not Require Money</p>
<p>Let us now examine the history of German production and the essence of its production form. Since the implementation of Goering's Four-Year Plan in 1935, the entire structure has been reformed. The method of this transformation is very interesting. In the depression era of 1927-28, there were six million unemployed. At that time, technical salvation organizations were formed, and at the same time, Hitler's Nazi movement occurred. This Nazi movement was both a political and ideological movement and a technical salvation organization led by Todt, which immediately went to the front lines. After the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, Todt's plan was fully implemented as one of the measures to save the country. The talented engineer Todt was appointed Minister of Engineering, and he implemented the construction of automobile-only roads, industrial construction, increased coal production, increased iron production, water transport infrastructure, and promoted the activities of frontline producers, making Germany's production system a regular management organization. After that, up to 1938, after entering the Sudetenland, and in 1939, after entering Poland, the national strength increased further. This transformation of the industrial organization cannot but be thorough, creating an industrial system that engages in production from both the human and material aspects, and has no relationship with money. To make a country prosperous, it is enough to establish a production system that economically uses people and things. Money is a secondary issue. Thus, the idea of separating from money becomes very strong. In war, there are not enough people, and there are not enough things, but in the situation of insufficiency, to make them work rationally, the current production system that is constrained by money will not work, and one must rely on people and things. This kind of production system has been implemented since 1939. When I met Speer's assistant, Zufahl, at the end of last year, he strongly asserted this: "Entrust production to the front line of production. We are producing for the country on that front line. If banks or other enterprises still use the old economic concepts to bind national production, then we intend to absorb even that part."</p>
<p>After Speer became Minister of Military Production last year, Minister of Economy Funk served as an advisor to the Ministry of Military Production, providing full support. Speer established production plans, and the Ministry of Economy then made various financial measures based on this. Therefore, in Germany now, there is not a budget first, and production is based on the budget, but rather there is production first, and then the income and expenditure are settled according to the production. The task of the Minister of Finance is not to establish a budget, but to settle accounts, implementing the idea that war does not require money. So I heard a certain technical researcher say: In Germany, four or five years ago, researchers were still subject to the allocation of research funds. They had to think carefully about how to use the allocated research funds, but now that is no longer necessary. When researching a certain problem, if they request the necessary materials, they buy them completely, without considering how much money it will cost, because money is irrelevant. In this way, researchers have no so-called research budget, only the assigned research problem and the allocation of necessary materials.</p>
<p>The Research Institute as the Main Body of the Enterprise</p>
<p>In this way, the so-called entrepreneur also becomes a proponent of production first. The enterprise form is based on the research institute. The powerful figures of the research institute are the managers of that enterprise. Let us take a certain enterprise as an example. If there is no one who is familiar with everything from the academic to the production situation to guide the production of that industry, the latest technology cannot be completed in the shortest amount of time. Therefore, the expenses and other things required for production are irrelevant. When the government issues an order to manufacture something, from the relevant research to the necessary materials to the mass production process, from planning to implementation, all the expenses required are paid by the government. As for the capital aspect, whether or not making that thing will make money, it goes without saying, and there is no need to say it. The required research expenses and everything else are almost entirely borne by the government. The operator only needs to mass produce, without having to worry about other things. The government guarantees a dividend interest of four or five percent on the invested capital. This is for the capital, and there is no room for other considerations for the enterprise. Therefore, production is leaping forward, and it has extraordinary elasticity, and it is becoming stronger day by day (翔: Translated from the Western Daily News, December 1st).</p>

All staff members are doing their best to conduct research in order to establish a posture of air defense. Since its establishment, preparations for various matters have been completed. No matter when enemy aircraft fly over Shanghai to carry out large-scale air raids, we are confident that Shanghai's defense will be very complete. However, air defense matters should always be thorough in every aspect and impeccable, so that disasters can be prevented when very unusual events occur, and in case of emergency, the rescue and treatment of affected civilians can also be effectively managed. In order to achieve this goal, it is essential to awaken the delayed air defense awareness of Shanghai's five million citizens and convey it to the air defense authorities to actively cooperate and jointly plan for complete security. Therefore, the headquarters has designated the 9th of each month, the anniversary of China's entry into the war, as "Air Defense Day," and the first week of the anniversary of China's entry into the war as the first "Air Defense Day."

<h3>The United States Does Not Recognize the New Bolivian Government; Minister Hirota's Remarks; The Truthful Face of East Asian Policy is Expressed by Facts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The United States government, because the Argentine government has already recognized the newly established Bolivian government of December 20 of last year, instructed the American-led Inter-American Defense Board to pass a resolution in the name of the board without mutual agreement among the American countries, not to recognize the new Bolivian government. The new Bolivian government, in view of this attitude of the United States, argued that the United States has no reason and did not pass through all the American countries to not recognize the legally established government, which is harsh oppression of a small and weak country, and lodged a serious protest. Mr. Hirota, the Director of Information of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, issued a statement on this matter, asserting that this clearly expresses the United States' policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and truthfully shows the true face of the United States' policy towards China and East Asian policy.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Two Points</p>
<p>Minister Hirota said: We should pay attention to two points regarding the measures taken by the United States against the new government of Bolivia in the name of the Inter-American Defense Board, namely: The new government of Bolivia was established in opposition to the economic relations maintained by the old government and the United States government, and there is a government that goes against the interests of the state. Therefore, the United States government puts pressure on it, and the motivation for not expressing its recognition is based on self-interest, which is what everyone expected. The Inter-American Defense Board was established on the basis of the Pan-American Union, but under the leadership of the United States, the board interferes in the internal affairs of a country by a majority. This fact can indicate that the peace-keeping mechanism currently promoted by the United States is similar to the League of Nations in its functions. As to how its function will be, it is evident from the United States' interference in Bolivia this time. The above two points cannot be ignored by us.</p>
<p>Economic Oppression</p>
<p>Recently, Argentine President Ramirez has been implementing reform policies and disbanding various political parties in the country. The two British and American representative newspapers, the London Times and the New York Times, criticized this as a barbaric act. The Ramirez government overthrew the weak cabinet last year and organized a powerful general government. In this world war, they still adhere to a neutral policy from a national standpoint, but the United States has attempted to drag Argentina into the anti-Axis camp and exerted various economic oppressions, but all have failed. The United States' diplomatic oppression, such as the oppression of economic issues such as finance and trade (the United States has banned exports to Argentina), as well as the use of corrupt elements within Argentina this time, is an old trick of the United States. Therefore, President Ramirez has taken drastic measures to clean up corrupt elements in the country, and the British and American public opinion is indeed for the barbaric behavior, which is appropriate.</p>
<p>To Indulge Its Selfish Desires</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be seen that the totalitarians of Britain and the United States often hope to take advantage of the political instability and unsoundness of other countries to indulge their selfish desires. They always support political machines that are beneficial to their own capital, and use that regime to exploit its people. Therefore, when other countries move from unstable and unsound politics to the right track, they regard it as a barbaric act and hope that the weak and small countries will be internally divided and collapse, and that they will be subordinate to them before they are happy. How is the world policy of British and American capital imperialism, and what is the content of the South American policy of good neighborliness called by Britain and the United States, is very clear. From this, we can also examine and recognize the content of their policies towards China and East Asia, what is the result.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Community</p>
<h3>Third Discussion on Special Consumption Taxes</h3>
<p>We have already discussed special wartime consumption taxes twice. Now, without fearing repetition, we wish to comment again:</p>
<p>Consumption tax can be divided into two types: one is first paid by merchants, then passed on to the final consumer. This is called indirect consumption tax, such as tariffs, salt tax, and consolidated tax; the other is directly paid by the final consumer along with the invoice or bill when purchasing goods, first to the merchant, then remitted to the public treasury. This is called direct consumption tax, such as retail tax, bill tax, and banquet tax. The former raises prices, and that is exactly the government's intention. The latter should have no effect on prices. However, consumers must pay special consumption tax in addition to the market price.</p>
<p>The government has decided to levy a special wartime consumption tax from the 16th of this month to raise wartime military and administrative expenses. The method is actually an expansion of the two percent retail tax on goods in this city over the past one or two years. Therefore, it is entirely a direct consumption tax, which should have no effect on raising prices. Unexpectedly, many merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices wildly, disregarding public livelihood, which is truly hateful. According to the Ministry of Finance's proposed tax rate, it is only four percent, but the newspapers initially based on news agency reports, mistakenly took it to be forty percent, causing panic and a rush to buy goods. Merchants then seized the opportunity to extract exorbitant profits, fearing they would be too slow. The news agency's report at the time may have had a slight error, but how could unscrupulous merchants spread rumors and raise prices to such an extreme, so quickly! After the start of the new year, the authorities should immediately correct this to ensure people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Price Deposit Certificates: Transfer or Mortgage; Ministry of Finance Entrusts Central Trust of China to Review and Designates Ten Banks to Accept</h3>
<p>The government pays for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth with special fixed deposit certificates from the Shanghai branch of the Central Trust of China. The transfer or mortgage of the deposit certificate must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has entrusted the Central Trust of China to execute the approval procedures. It is said that the Shanghai branch of the Central Trust of China, to ensure careful review, has specially established a "Special Certificate Financing Review Committee for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth." For those applying for transfer or mortgage, the committee will thoroughly examine whether it is truly necessary before deciding whether to approve it. Furthermore, since the certificate can be used as collateral for loans, to prevent the abuse of random transfers and receipts, banks and money houses are strictly prohibited from accepting it casually. The Central Trust of China has designated ten banks (Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Xingye Bank, Commercial Bank of China, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Salt Bank, The Continental Bank, Chung Nan Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Shiyong Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank) to implement the procedures in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stocks Open Higher with More Gains than Losses; Silk Industry Stocks See New Highs Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not open due to unresolved commission issues. Later, the industry decided to implement new procedures after the Spring Festival holiday, and the market only opened at 2:30 PM. The market situation, after fluctuating, ended with more gains than before the holiday. A small segment actually experienced losses. China Silk Industry stocks saw the strongest gains, soaring by a huge 57.5 yuan. Meiya Silk Factory also rose by more than 10 yuan. Zhenfeng Cotton Mill saw buying interest, surging 5.5 yuan. China Underwear was bought up by the financial sector, skyrocketing by 13 yuan. Renfeng surged 13.5 yuan, exceeding 60 yuan. In the cultural industry, China Film rose by more than 19.5 yuan compared to before the holiday. Department store and new pharmaceutical and chemical stocks saw slight fluctuations. Real estate stocks turned flat due to significant gains during the holiday. Jiuan Industrial and Guohua Investment saw mixed gains and losses. Yesterday, five new stocks, including Tongzhuan Machinery and Jianlu Real Estate, debuted, with prices rising in a straight line. The closing prices of each stock are recorded below.</p>
<p>Stock Name	Evening Close</p>
<p>China Silk Industry	375.00</p>
<p>Meiya Silk Factory	196.00</p>
<p>Wing On Textile	194.00</p>

<p>Summary of Market Conditions</p>
<p>Government Bonds	Yesterday's opening saw very large fluctuations, with a difference of more than ten yuan between the high and low prices. Due to the rapid fluctuations, disputes arose in the market. As a result, although the market price rose slightly, the rapid fluctuations caused special problems. After the opening, Class C bonds rose twice, but then selling increased sharply, and the market price fell steadily, with very little fluctuation, reaching the lowest price. White selling was extremely high, and most buyers were in distress. Fortunately, the major threshold was not broken. The final price at noon was slightly lower than before the New Year by two or three yuan. Classes A, B, D, and E also weakened.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rate	Yesterday, the call loan rate of the Money Trade Association was 0.2, showing a slight increase of 0.02, indicating that money supply has loosened.</p>
<p>Rice Market	Several thousand bags arrived via both water and land routes. Sporadic transactions were sluggish, and retail demand was limited. The market situation remained similar to before, but miscellaneous and coarse grains were scarce, showing a bullish trend. Northern japonica rice was priced at 25, thin varieties at around 24, Dujian rice at 24, Doudou over 1,000, Shahuang approaching 1,000, and the rest had no market.</p>

<h3>First Division Football League: Tung Wah Leads, Liaison Police Closely Follows</h3>
<p>In the first round of the First Division Football League, Tung Wah won all six matches, completing an absolute advantage. The future looks optimistic. Liaison has only played four matches, with three wins and one loss. The remaining two matches are against First Police and Portuguese Merchants, so there are many obstacles. First Police follows with three wins and two losses in five matches, also with six points, and the match with Liaison will be crucial for ranking. Portuguese Merchants follow closely with two wins and two losses. Overseas Chinese recently received the support of former Italian army members, and their strength has increased significantly. Hope for the championship has been dashed. Jewish ranks sixth. Three Provinces, having fought repeatedly, is at the bottom. The recent situation is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Second Batch of Winter Clothing Being Made; Raw Materials Being Applied For</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper published "Poor Teachers Request Winter Clothing" on November 9th of last year, we have successively received donations from all walks of life totaling 3,470 yuan by November 17th. After distributing 1,970 yuan to help the designated poor teachers (as published in this newspaper on November 24th of last year), there was a surplus of 1,500 yuan. To provide widespread relief to the poor, we immediately began collecting donations for winter clothing. Kind people from all walks of life enthusiastically donated and assisted, reaching 239,903 yuan and 65 cents by December 31st. Furthermore, recognizing the difficulty in purchasing winter clothing, we provided services to charitable organizations and groups by assisting in the production of winter clothing. The organizations that assisted in production included the Chinese Education Moral Association, Mingde Jiyi Association, Red Swastika Society, Shanghai South Charity Association, Ren Ci Charity Association, Zun Sheng Xian Association, Qiyuan Dharma Assembly, and various businesses and individuals, all actively assisting in production. Initially, the limit was 1,800 sets, but due to enthusiastic requests from all walks of life, a total of 4,046 sets of winter clothing were assisted in production by December 27th, totaling 64,730 yuan. The funds were subsequently transferred to the Buddhist Congee Kitchen for clothing distribution. All of the second batch of winter clothing will be rushed into production and distributed as soon as the application is approved.</p>

It is reported that Mr. Gan Luxin, General Manager of Luxin Tobacco Co., Ltd., and his colleagues generously donated 200,000 yuan to help the society carry out various relief efforts.

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (10)</p>
<p>The term exams have passed without incident. Zhenren is confident that he did well on the English and Math exams. Though Japanese and Chinese were subjects he was less proficient in, he feels as though he managed to acquire an average score. Music was his only undoing. Though his voice was beautiful, he had never received a satisfactory score in it since primary school.</p>
<p>An announcement was made on the day after exams that principal Kawata would be holding a talk, and that all first years would be gathering in the auditorium. Students sporting white hat covers arrived at the auditorium one by one. The hall, which was located away from the schoolhouse, was filled with a quiet and clean air. On the pure white wall in the front hung a brilliant chrysanthemum, the crest of the imperial household. Each student removed their hat to deliver their most respectful greetings at the entrance. Principal Kawata, a man of immense stature, stood at the podium, bowing deeply.</p>
<p>“Today, I will be discussing the Navy senior Yuka Nakahara. I assume you are all aware of the inscription we erected in the schoolyard…”</p>
<p>The first year students glanced at each other. Just like Ryuou, none of them realized the existence of this inscription.</p>
<p>“This inscription marks the location of a mansion, where Yukai Nakahara of the Tetsushinsai school was born on April 8th of Tempo 3…”</p>
<p>The principal spoke for approximately an hour. Put simply, Yuka was a scientist, educator, and a courageous soldier. At 18 years of age, he studied Western learning in Nagasaki (The earliest ordinary way for Western learning to enter Japan was called Kandan – Translator's note). At 22, he was permitted by the lord of the domain, Yutaka, to oversee the construction of weaponry, ships, and machinery for the Soma Navy. He dedicated himself to the founding of the modern navy. He was a true patriot, understanding that the country and the domain were lacking in the forthcoming era of war, and struggling against the prevailing way of thought. The reason why the Japanese navy is able to boast around the world about its surging morale and scientific excellence is thanks to the dreams of Yuka Nakahara.</p>
<p>Yuka studied in Edo, at the school of Tarozaemon Egawa and Sekken Yasui, but while studying at Yasui's school, a Satsuma steam battleship entered Shinagawa port. The onlookers from all levels of society lined up as a wall, and Sekken, guided by Yuka, also went to look over the ship. Yuka did not mention a single word to his teacher about the fact that he built those ships himself. After finding out about the truth later, Sekken clapped his knees in praise of Yuka’s nature of practicing modesty, and that he can even sharpen the local spirit after being acknowledged by the general Tojo – this is also a certain kind of localism.</p>
<p>Yuka created the first mechanical naval mine in Japan in preparation for the Anglo-Satsuma War. He was also a master of artillery, so he fought in the Boshin War as a naval staff officer for the new government. During the Battle of Hokuetsu, while facing Kawai Tsugunosuke, he was struck in the right leg by enemy fire, thus ending his 37 years of life. The ending of his life was also unlike others. As someone who had faith in science, he knew this was fate, and refused all medical care – Zhenren listened attentively to the talk, unblinking.</p>
<h3>Gospel for Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Charitable people are extremely concerned about the education and upbringing of refugee children and orphans. This year, they made a new vow to donate a huge sum to investigate and subsidize this. Any refugee children's and orphanage homes that have already been established in this city and have achieved results but are feeling a lack of funding can create an overview and final report within this month and send it to post office box 926. After sending staff to conduct an on-site investigation, if it is determined that they are qualified, they will be given a certain subsidy.</p>
<p>Qingxin Righteous School Enrollment	Qingxin Public Free Primary School, 480 Nanjing Road, tuition is free, a security deposit is charged. Those with poor family circumstances can request books. The next semester is scheduled to begin on February 9th. There are many openings in the higher grades. Registration time is from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>Distressed Widow Seeks Tailoring Work	Widow Fei Yuan, age 65, from Ningbo, relies on making clothes for others to make a living. Recently, due to the cold weather and high prices, few people are hiring her. The old woman wants to seek a simple meal but cannot get it. Hoping that people in society will provide indirect assistance, the prices are half off from market prices. Contact at 18 Houde Lane, Julu Road (Juxu Dalu).</p>
<p>Lost and Found Residence Permit	Recently, a residence permit for Chu Ni, 59 Hanjiatan, Outer Second Bureau, Beijing, and a residence permit for Lu Tingquan, 108 Zhongshan East Road, Dongzhen, Hangzhou County, were found in the mailbox.
