<h3 id="c1">社評　利已心的否定 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>友松圓諦氏在上海大學講「中國靑年之進路」，說佛家的中心思想就在利己心的否定，又說東洋道德是出發於修身齊家而擴大到治國平天下的，不能治心中賊的人，怎樣能够滅亡心中之賊，所以公正無私的精神是決不可缺。不專顧到自己一人的利益，而獻身於鄉黨社會和國家，是非常重要的。友松圓締氏因此希望中國靑年，先要養成高尚的道德，這樣才可以挽救中國。</p>
<p>上面所引的話，可以說都是東方民族的傳統精神，都是東方民族能够綿延永久的原動力，可是，近百年來中國人民受英美思想的傳染，利己主義和唯利主義，至少已經深印在一般都市市民的腦海裏，假如任這個思想遺傳下去，中國民族國家勢必自趨滅亡，中國國民個個都要成為無國籍的猶太人了。凡是關心於國家前途的人，所以對於這個利己心理，不能不大聲疾呼，加以攻擊，攻擊的目標，雖為某個人或某團體，可是攻擊的出發點，連粹在校正利己心理，並非對某一個人或某一個團體別有惡感。友邦人士關心中國問題的，願意協助中國的復興的亦時常發出同樣的議論，現在友松圓諦氏又可說是代表。</p>
<p>上海是受英美文化侵略最重要的口岸，上海市民在這種環境之下，至少都在有意無意之間，染着些利己的氣味。特別是在租界沒有收回以前，憑着特殊的勢力，大多數人每追隨於英美敵人之後，做着唯己唯利的事。因為商業的畸形發展，幾乎使全上海市民大多數威爲唯利是圖的商人。因為金錢可以換取個人的享受，幾乎使全上海市民大多數都變成拜金主義的信徒。一般暴發戶更是唯利主義唯己主義的標準，在社會上最足動搖一般意志不定的市民，日積月累，更足以影響整個社會。試看近幾年來上海畸形的繁榮，上海社會道德的淪亡，上海社會意志的薄弱，處處部表示上海的不上正軌而走入邪道</p>
<p>要知道，在一個社會國家一裏面，國民個人主義的極度發展，就表示社會國家的極度後退，到了社會國家後退到不能存在而消滅的時候，國民個人也將根本不能存在而同歸於書的。歷史上的先例舉不勝舉，而現在的上海正走在這個減亡的路上，怎樣能夠不使人憂盧恐慌。這是社會是心理病病根已深，病象已危，此時不治，必至日後無救藥可。為了振作上海人的心理，為了拯救上海的前途，目前必須用最大的決心，把這個社會心理病態根本剷除。政府應該用政治力量去制裁，社會應該用輿論的力量去指摘，必須聚合各方面的力量向同一目標進攻。若不消滅這個心中之賊，上海沒有前途的。</p>

<p>東京二十二臼中央社電　日機爲協力陸地部隊作戰，會於二十一日夜轟炸塞班鳥南部阿基幹岬，俄比阿姆附近之敵舟庭羣，予以重創，日機則全部安返基地。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　美國自變更造船計劃，將自由型船決然改造爲勝利型船後，其船員不足情形，益見重大化，對自由型船船員雖儘量減少，然勝利型船較自由型船需用之船員爲多。又因最近正造四千噸之中型貨物船，船員之不足，將益見深刻化。美國政府曾盡全力訓練船員，本年造船計劃合計為二一六一六一艘，該新造船需普通及高級船員七千一百名以上，此外，尚須補充船員之缺額，其中以高級船員中機關士之不足為最深刻。為講求對策，戰時海運局商船訓練部，特增設該部直轄之商給學校，僅經三閱月之訓練，即速成為船員，其能力低劣，自勿廣述。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日軍沿湘江　向衡陽進攻　渝方進行疏散人口 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本廿二日中央社電　據合衆社重慶訪員訊，湖南及河南戰况如次：渝軍富局發表，日軍正沿湘江東西兩岸向衡陽南下進攻中，幷承認日軍右翼己進至湘鄉（衡陽北方八十八公里），左翼則己佔領醴陵（衡陽東北百二十公里）。又河南戰錢日軍正自平漢綫東方南進中，更向正陽前進四十八里，因此自鄭州以南之隴海綫，至信陽東方方面之日軍各陣地之述絡，僅餘四十八公里，即可完成云。</p>
<p>廣州廿二日中央社電　據重慶廣播，渝軍當局已於廿一日承認長沙陷落，並稱當局對湖南省省城衡陽方面，於數日來曾積極强制疏散人口，傳此疏散工作，現已大致完畢云。</p>
<h3 id="c4">渝軍作戰意氣銷沉 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　日內閣情報周第三部積山情報官，曾於二十一日下午會見駐日中國記者團，特就長沙作戰，及渝軍士氣萎廢事，談稱如次：日軍此次於湖南作戰，業將長沙攻陷，此次最堪注目者，為與上次情形迥然不同。常日軍攻至長沙後，渝軍即義悉數退出，致該市絲毫未受戰亂，安全歸諸日軍之手。渝軍之補備極其貪弱，敵美對渝之武器貸與，事實上能實行與否，實為疑問。即祝有些許之貸與，其亦只限於以駐淪美軍為基幹之軍隊而己。其地一電隊概未受貸與。此次湖南作戰，日軍於巧妙作戰下，專事痛擊攪亂亞洲安寗之駐渝美英軍，與作英夫走狗蹂躪中國民衆之渝軍，而於可能範圍內，不使一般無辜民衆遭受戰火之災。至於渝軍士氣，微諸河南作戰，有渝軍大批歸順國府衆之事實，既可知渝軍已無如昔日之阡盛戰意云。</p>
<h3 id="c5">渝機襲靖港日海軍 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>湖南日軍某基地二十二日中央社電　華中日陸軍各部隊，前於五月二十七日，在湖南平原展開攻勢，同時日海軍部隊，亦隊湘江長沙航路開始進攻。於六月六日晨攻陷營田（湘江沿岸要衝），邇後繼續自水路進攻長沙，卒於十七日突入靖港（長沙西北四十公里），將之完全佔領。其中於洞庭湖口靖港問，約百公里之湘江進攻作戰，歷經幾多艱苦，乃得完成。按湖南全省以湘江為主幹水路，故湘江即該省之經濟大動脈，今該水路大半已入日軍手中，故予淪方打壓甚大。因此渝空軍乃執拗襲擊日海部隊，例如於靖港附近，淪空軍常以戰鬥聯炸機聯合編隊約三四十架來襲，日海軍部隊即以防空砲火予渝軍相常損失，而將之擊退云。</p>
<h3 id="c6">渝美空軍移動趨勢 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十二日中央於電　美空軍過去以雲南省昆明為中心根據地，在談地周國，散設幾多大小澦備機塲，作為全中國戰綫之補給基地。同時更在桂林設立前進基地，以此為中心，向東北方扇形邊綠之衡陽·零陵·遂川·建甌·等地建祝多數基地羣，籍此充實西南中國之航空戰力。日空軍對此亦不斷對之加以攻擊，幷監視渝美空軍，時而粉碎美空軍之企圖。日戰在美機十六日轟炸北九州之前，曾於十日急襲零陵。衡陽。炸毀渝機十三架，繼於十一日空襲遂川，一舉炸毀渝機三十五架，（內有大型機。）十二日急襲恩施（湖北）梁山（四川），毀大小渝機十二架。更於十三日轟炸建甌，（現被視為空襲臼本土最有力之機塲，）炸毀其滑翔路，及附屬設處。使不能用。今駐淪美空軍以其在西南中國之戰力配備，遭“空軍不斷之壓迫受挫，渝美空軍為迥避日空軍之銳進，似正擬向西北地區移動。頃據日機偎察漢中（陝西省中部）等機塲，近已加張數備。又傳隴海綫上之實鶏·天水·及甘肅省關州等地，亦均爲渝方空軍之有力基地。渝美空軍由中國西南向西北移動，實即預下今後渝美空軍動向之重要關鍵，故其動靜頗値注目矣。</p>

<p>柏林二十二日中央社電德國新開社引德官方戰報稱：諾曼第戰區之敵軍，日昨對奧納河以柬之德軍包圍圈數度發動攻勢，均被挫敗。敵軍對瑟堡堡壘以大隊價察部隊重行發動攻勢，亦被擊退，德步兵第二四三師團司令官赫爾米黑少將，於六月十七日為保衛瑟堡半島而壯烈成仁。</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社特派員蔭森稱：反軸心軍以大軍集中進攻瑟堡要塞，德軍以寡敵衆，繼績破壞該港之設施，大部份之港口設施業已不堪再用，船隻之航行亦遭封鎖，防止反軸心國海軍目海上進攻之對策亦已實施，反軸心國主力艦與巡洋艦似已放棄一砲轟瑟堡四圍，恐係動於德軍大砲之威力所致。德國方面已盡其所能，徹底破壞瑟堡之一切港口設施，以免於放棄談港後，徒供敵軍之用。德國負責方面一相，在目前環境之下，瑟堡可扼守相當之時期，即德軍不能對柯坦汀半島發動救助之進攻亦然，反軸心軍欲在他處大舉登陸，必須在佔領瑟堡之後，故陸上之主力戰，亦須延至戰事之第二階段始有發展。</p>

<p>米統會的機構與具體的收買方針之確定夕實在太落後了。開始收買比普通遲一個月至二個月，因此，錯過了最重要的收買期。各地區都是在十一月下句或十二月上旬開始工作的，米統會在其初創時，不，在其初創以前，即已犯了極大的錯誤了。何况不僅開始時期失之過遲，資金的貸與也嫌太慢，且毫無準備即發表收買價格，那價格不以農民的出價價格為中心，而以採辦商向米統會交納價格爲中心，發表後的結果，乃造成市價的暴漲。四地區的人們，都指此爲主要原因，此種失敗，實堪注意。蓋這些人們決不漢視松江及崑山的米統會辦事處所指摘的諸原因，而是從惡劣環境中切身感到收買困難的人們。且這種惡劣的環境縱然存在着米統會如果不遷延時日以確立上海的機構，而令下部機精在收獲時即同時收買，至少可獲得相當的收買成續。去年米統會的收買方針發表後，記者在常熱召開收買業者的座談會，當時全體的意見，正與上面相同。所以這失敗並不是實行後方才明白，實行前其失敗即在意料之中。記者目覩常熟的人們常新米登塲時切齒痛恨而袖手旁觀的情形。這種失敗，與收買棉紗棉布後沒有下文而致其政策發生大破綻的件質不同，自始就不能說是得策，而爲國府當局所應反省的。這收買工作的遲延，如前所述，不僅使收買的受到收買困難的痛苦，並目使農民受不必要的困憊。茲舉一例，某崑山農民致函收買商，其內容如次：</p>
<p>希君收買能早日開始。收獲後我們可賣米換夠生活必需品。但米統會指定商的收買太晚，不能不出賣於別的商人。可是我們出賣了相當量的米以後，又被强迫出賣，不能不出賣二次，且那時收買價格與市價已相差極大，此在我們出賣者是極不利的。有米時不收買，無米時强賣，究竟為何呢？今後希望考慮百姓的利益，早一點開始收買，早一點結束。</p>
<h3 id="c18">速籌根本對策 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>環境縱然惡劣，政策縱然不完備，如果開始收買的時期不那麼遲，則收買的成績不致如今日這樣不佳。內地有很多人說這種話，我們不能不虛懷接受。爲了克服這落後，米統會必須再加四倍五倍的努力。例如在某一地區，從三月至四月之間，將軍創時的一切準備工作都迅速地實踐了。在此期間，米統會創辦後三個月間所得的米糧，該地在十日間收足了，這實是一件驚異的事。</p>
<p>記者曾向各地的人士詢問：「如果動手得更早，並在新歲之前卿已完完成三月至四月間的準備工作，則收買或能順利進行吧？」各地人士均以為然。新的工作辦法如最近公佈的米糧辦法中，並沒有長篇累讀十條二十條之多，祗有一條「迅速果敢」。現在早已不是計算死兒年齡的時候了。我們所要求於國府與米統會者，對於今年收穫的施策，是否已經決定？立即付諸實施的準備，是否已經完完成？假使犯了與去年一樣的錯誤，縱決定了怎樣完備的施策，那也等於是向死者頭藥。有人對記者說:「即使熱心做準備工作，也徒然弄得得很無趣。」這是決不能聽而不聞的話。內地各機關根據去年度的輕騐，即使完成了一切準備興體制，但發表的方針，使那準備會全歸無用。結果，使協力準備工作的人們，對農一民不能取信。（譯自六月廿一日火陸新報竹本特派員無錫通訊）</p>

<p>漢口二十二日中央社電　日軍自四月開始在河南作戰以來，以破竹之勢，先後佔領鄭州·洛陽，徹底粉碎渝方企圖。繼在上月問發動湖南作戰，目前湘省要衝長沙，已為日軍精銳攻陷。此於眾事經濟上，打擊淪方極大。日中國派遺軍總司令部三品報道部長，特爲此發表談話，茲誌如下：</p>
<p>前錢派遣軍先進攻河南之要衡洛陽陝縣，而打通平漢鐵路，席捲抗戰政權之第一戰區，潰滅其中力軍。又復轉鋒長江南域，進攻渝軍防禦湖南之銷錀長沙。曾於五月下旬以米，在海陸空軍緊密協力下，實行奇襲作戰，不旋踵問，在該地周圍地區，擊減第九戰區渝軍主力。六月十八日，完完全攻陷長沙，目前在該地周邊地區綱積進行擊滅掃蕩戰中。</p>
<p>溯日派遣軍之使命，乃以大東亞戰爭之正義，打倒犧牲中國，以逞其侵略柬亞野心之英美帝國主義勢力，確保防衛大陸之戰略陣綫，庶中國國家民族，早日脫離英美壓心與侵略，即趨於解放之途，進而完成統一建國之歷史的使命。是故今春以來，震動大陸之戰爭，乃日派遣軍超越敵人英美等一切之疑懼憶測恐怖惶感等等脆弱心理，基於泰然安居不動之信念，與實力主動之作戰行動也。</p>
<h3 id="c20">現實擊破幻想 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>至若一城一市之攻略，與夫抗戰勢力之攻毀，是為戰果之卜者，問非日派遣軍之所以介懷。惟於此有不能不對內外閘明並警告者，為對於英美渝之妄想與希望的觀測，即以口下日本國力，因受太平洋或亞細亞方面之紊制及南耗，已失其採取攻勢之餘力，而陷於困乏疲敝之狀態，藉今次作戰而予以嚴正的事實之證明，鐵與火之　告，以現實擊破彼等之幻想，「如不將亞細亞日軍加以殲減，則不足以打倒日本」，此語先出之於敵將尼米資之日，此後如軍事評諭家威恩塔，駐重慶美報特派員阿多開恩蘇無不異口同普，隨聲附和。惟細按其辭氣，雖不免含有多量要素，然此亦可謂為明顯面眞率之呼聲，更可證明日派遣革在大陸決戰之態勢與主動之地位。</p>
<p>試觀戰綫起自西北之關門落陽，遠扼河南之沃野以至武漢，更直搗湖南領倫之長沙，以派遣重雄大致戰力，與卓絕之機動戰略，對比綽綽陣有途。到於重慶並美國空軍，則已扼制其由西北至四川之咽候，而制其死命矣。</p>

<p>日陸軍防空司令部，鑒於以往本市當警戒警報發出，一般車輛並不停止行駛，致當時交通頗皂混亂狀態，乃於二十日以告示第二十四號予以修正，此蓋當警戒警報發出後，對於敵機之動靜端賴聽覺探知，常時若暄嗓雜沓。取所不宜，故乃有修正之舉。防空司令部當局有鑒於事體之重大，復於二十二日發表談話，就此次修正意義，詳細說明如次：</p>
<p>告示中（乙）項規定附近警報發出後五分鐘，汽車等類，得以二十里以下之速度，開始通行，一般通行人亦得恢復通行，惟應勿妨碍防空工作，並不得惹起交通事故云云，共中所謂附近警報發出後，乃因目前警報汽笛之吹嗚，全市並不一致，有待防空本部警報發出後，經過五分鍾以上，始經吹鳴者，故乃以各地附近警報發出時間為標準，因各地警報吹嗚時問之不同，故交通停止及解除之時刻，亦不一致，與防空司令部發佈警報之時刻，或不一致，務須注意，一般通行人應遵照吿示規定，於警報發出後，應即至附近遭難所或通路外側這難。</p>
<p>有時亦有不發布些戒警報，而即吹嗚空襲警報者，此時音嚮交通管制，尤為必要，凡一切車輪及一般通行者，應須照舊停止交通。又當警戒警報發出後，如附近並無適當避難所或空壕時，一般通行者，應於附近警報發出十分鐘後，從速返家。又以往經當局屢經喚起注意者，即為遮光之不完備，頗多漏光，殊為遣憾，凡未具有遮光設備者，應於警報發出後，立即滅燈，至警報解除以前，不得開燈。凡違反規定者，決停止供給電流，以示微戒。希認上海全體市民應益奮起，對於此次吿示之主旨，務須充分瞭解，服從當局指揮，嚴守音饗交通管制為要。</p>

<p>侵攻戰的發動</p>
<p>本月六日上午一時法國北就沿海基賽耶塞爾島有英美空中敢死隊降落。一時半，英國第一及第六降落傘師團在哈伐·奧納河口問，美國第八第二及第一一一降落傘師團在奧納河口瑟堡間降下，以確保上陸據點爲目的，攻　　點在於巴爾福爾·卡倫坦·伊修·吐爾維埃。</p>
<p>他方面，掩護上陸部隊的反軸心艦隊集結於英法海峽基賽耶塞爾島之間。上午五時半，在隆隆的掩護砲盤中，英美聯軍的上陸用舟艇團和降落傘部隊向各地突進。德國防軍對此迅即冷靜展開反擊，對海上艦隊，則由海岸砲和魚雷艇隊實行邀擊戰。在地面上，於同日午前，殲滅了巴爾福爾·塞納河·奧納河地帶的空中敢死隊。到黃昏時止，基賽耶塞爾島和哈伐瑟堡爾地間的反軸心軍，或被殲滅，或被迫回海上，僅在奧納河岸阿勒瑪尼附近廣二十公里深二公里的小地帶殘留一部分上陸軍。</p>
<p>據德國元首大本營公報，哈伐港及瑟堡港之間諾曼第北岸一帶敵軍的上陸作戰，自七日晨起已得海軍火力的掩護。在要塞背後降下的許多空中敢死隊，目的在支援上陸作戰，並阻止德軍增援，但於着陸之際遭遇高射砲的邀擊，損失甚大，以後經過短時的截擊即告肅清，從海上登陸的敵軍於數處獲得立足點，已告成功。但所築橋頭堡大半因受德軍反攻而破壞，海岸上過佈上陸用舟艇的殘骸。</p>
<p>奧納河口及卡倫坦北方目下正展開激戰，迄今堅守橋頭的敵軍正受德軍的壓迫。</p>
<p>又，六日晨德國魚雷艇會在塞納灣攻擊敵主力艦隊。</p>
<p>諾曼第的地勢</p>
<p>法國北部戰線的諾曼第半島，乃因遠在千年以前，諾曼第族人，越北海險浪侵入而得名。諾曼第地方面對英國海峽，自聖米西爾灣以至布萊斯爾河，約二百乃一百五十公尺高的丘陵地帶。稱植榖物的田地廣闊，村落稀少，山谷埋藏在森林之中，自一月至九月，山的斜面上，開着雪白的蘋果花，風光明媚，景色宜人。</p>
<p>海岸都是灰白的絕壁，接連如屏風，其下爲險峻的磯石，狹狹的伸展，塞納河和維爾河等的河口，都從喇叭狀的塞納灣，結集於瑟堡，一帶白砂青鬆的平坦地勢，實爲登陸的絕妙場所，敵方如在諾曼第半島一帶，確立橋頭堡，進擊歐洲內部，則由此而進擊巴黎盆地，最好不過。且此處織道幹線四通八達，可以利用，實爲德國機動部隊最好活躍地點。</p>
<p>塞納河與巴黎盆地在指頭間蜿行，自廬昂構通亞維爾，塞納河至巴黎近郊，又有小型艦艇可以通航，敵方擇此爲登陸地點不無理由。洛佛在塞納河口，居於巴黎外港的地位，爲法國有數的港口，人口十五萬八千人，開戰以前，佔法國全國貿易額的四分之一。街道廣闊，美景甚多，在古色古香的都市中，要算是現代化的。</p>
<p>瑟堡在諾曼第半島的北端，承接卡萊與狄埃浦，爲控制距離英國最近的海峽的要港，路易十世時代，即已計劃設爲軍港，至拿破崙，乃大規模築爲軍港，成爲法國著名的軍港。其附近柯坦汀海岸地氣潮濕，綠野連綿，牧畜事業甚盛。</p>
<p>加恩爲塞納河南方一帶，標高百公尺以下的悠靜的丘陵地帶，以平原爲中心，唯知從事畜産至本世紀初期，南方發現了石炭，乃一躍而爲工業的中心，人口也超過了五萬，街上石造建築物甚多，聖批愛爾寺，馬爾各答等中世紀的建築物遺跡尚存。</p>
<p>登陸軍爲德軍完全殲滅的基賽和雅塞兩島，爲海峽諸島中的大島，在地理上，靠近諾曼第半島，在今次大戰前爲英國所領。雅塞而積二十八平方哩，人口五千，剛西面積十六平方哩，人口四千餘，雖說是英國領土，但充分浴着法國文化，當地的風俗，完全法國化。雅塞島的南岸，有廣大的海灣，美妙的砂濱，冬季時候倫敦的旅客，紛紛前來避寒。</p>
<p>敵方指揮首腦</p>
<p>歐洲　攻戰反軸心最高司令官爲美國艾森霍華大將，副司令爲英國戴達大將，其下分設陸海空軍三軍司令官，茲略述各人來歷如下：</p>
<p>艾森霍華現年五十四歲，生於美國台克撒州，少年時代在坎薩斯王蜀黍田園中撫育長成。你爲農村實業家，觀其姓氏，可知其先祖實係德國人而移居美國者。　曾在坎薩斯大學，陸軍步兵戰軍學校，陸大戰軍學部，工兵學部等卒業。初無籍籍名，後爲菲島守將麥克沃塞器重，任爲參謀長，而露頭角。大東亞戰爭爆發後，召回華盛頓，任美參謀本部作戰計劃部次長，致力於北非登陸計劃之草擬，一九四一年六月，任駐歐洲美國作戰司令官，同年十一月任爲北非反軸心軍總司令官，一舉成名。其人個性剛勇，觀於此次選擇德國防禦最堅固之歐洲要塞登陸，即可知之。</p>
<p>戴達現年五十五歲，畢業於劍橋大學歷史系。由陸軍勤務而入空軍部。一九三六年任英國極東軍司令官，次年任中東空軍司令官，一九四一年以來，任地中海方面空軍司令官，亦因北非之役而聞名。去年二月，英空軍部，因戴達之建議，而在沿海空軍司令部內，新設“作戰的空軍部隊”與“戰略的空軍部隊”，對歐洲作有組織的轟炸。因此機緣而得任侵歐軍副司令之職</p>
<p>侵歐軍陸軍部隊司令官，英國蒙高茂萊大將，以“穩重”見稱。現年五十八歲，生於愛爾蘭，爲四年前鄧扣克之役敗戰，但至北非戰役結束後，又煊嚇一時。</p>
<p>海軍司令官英國拉姆賽大將，出自名門，曾任東印度艦隊司令長官，此次北法作戰中統率英美加三國艦隊及挪威·波蘭·荷蘭·法國·希臘各亡命政權艦隊作戰。</p>
<p>德國巧妙戰術</p>
<p>在西歐登陸戰發動前德軍已有萬全的準備。據說某次全歐洲德軍總監羅美爾元帥巡視法國北部沿海時，只見牧場碧綠，雜花亂生，貯立其間，不禁呌聲“妙哉”，隨從的幕僚都表驚異，羅美爾元帥乃環顯部下而言道，“妙哉，在這花業之下，埋藏著八萬枚地雷，隨時等待敵人的來臨呢”。這是德國的巧妙戰術之一。侵攻戰開始迄今，德國的新奇戰具層出不窮。反軸心軍的空中部隊，落地以後，紛紛誤觸地雷爆炸，烈燄　天，宛如火獄。敵方此次利用空中部隊，規模甚大，德方估計其有四個乃至六個師團之衆，編隊長達八十公里，該項空中部隊，多乘大型滑翔機，但被德軍擊落千架以上。（譯自六月八·九·十·十二日每日新聞）</p>

<p>華北日軍在河南平原開始進攻後，不足兼旬，即於五月九日，將大陸縱貫鐵道一環的京漢鐵道全線打通。此次作戰在規模與計劃上均更甚於徐州會戰，武漢攻略戰。事變以來，等待七年，今終得實現。先是，京漢線北段自北京至新鄉，已由日方駛車。京漢線南段漢口。信陽間，亦已恢複，此次由日方新修複者，爲新鄉。信陽間長約三百五十公里之一段，據傳該段之軌道及一切鐵道設備，均俄攜走內地。京滬鐵道沿線爲啣接華中華北之地帶，軍事上固不必說，即在政治，經濟上亦極重要。華中華北日軍在確山攜手，對呼應太平洋攻勢而在大陸反攻之渝軍，實爲致命打擊。（　根據大東亞戰爭畫報第三十一輯製）</p>

<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>上海，可說是音樂氣氛最濃厚的一個都市了；上海市民，對音樂欣賞的興趣及程度，與全國其他各地比起來，了可說是水準最高的了，但是，我們　看自歐風東漸以來，　風氣之先的上海，國人皆浸淫於西洋音樂的研習，對我國固有的音樂的精義，反多湮沒生疏，不談研究改進，更難說其發揚光大了！現時一般音樂專校，教的全是西樂，而所謂音樂家之流，亦都是手提凡亞鈴，指彈披　　，演奏的自然也都是歐西曲調了。</p>
<p>其實，中國古樂在世界音樂史的過程上說來，也算是發達得極早的，遠在週秦之世，已列爲六藝之一科，到了唐宋，更因帝王的倡導，而盛極一時。可是，傳到了現在，因爲樂譜理論和樂器構造各方面都不求改進，以致國粹精華不能保存，反有失傳之勢，益是可惜的。</p>
<p>每一國家的音樂，都有著它獨具的國民性，中國音樂，自然也有它獨特的風格，我們雖可盡量地捨短取長，採納西樂的形式　技巧，但對於足以代表民族性的國樂之精華卻是不能不予保存的！</p>
<p>國樂的特色，即在富於東方情趣，它的音色是優美的，曲調是雅俗共賞的，而傳情達意更是美妙幽雅的，藉著絲竹管絃出神入華的發奏，往往能發揮至深的感人偉力，能激動人內心的共鳴，也能換取感情的交流。若以色彩來象徵音樂的話，那麽，西樂的交響曲是雜色的，五彩繽紛的，而國樂呢，就是總粹的典雅的，富有溫柔淡泊恬靜美的天藍色了！——當然，這並不是說國樂純是幽靜的曲調，如古行軍曲中亦有不少是擊威雄壯氣象萬千的，而帝王　樂曲中所表達的富麗堂皇繁華熱鬧也可媲美西方的交響呢。他如　街僻巷，民　疾苦之呼號，亦每借絲竹曲曲傳出感人心肺，國樂又何嘗不是大衆化，通俗化的音樂呢？</p>
<p>現在報告給大家一個喜訊——國樂研究會，應各界之要求，已決定在本月廿八·廿九兩天五點半至七點半　座蘭心劇場，公開演奏了！國樂研究會，集合了十幾位會員，從事業餘研習以保存國樂視爲己任，足跡竟達海外，欲以宣揚國光。會長孫裕先生對我國古樂虛心研究探討其音樂才識與技巧尤使該會生色不少，前此　次公開演奏，極獲聽衆之贊美，此番再接再厲，演奏精彩名曲，並請葉大　先生暨　玉小姐表演　傳武當劍術，沈述　小姐歌唱助興，希望能普遍喚起國人對國樂的認識與　起研究的興趣，傳使國樂在世界樂壇上一放異彩！</p>

<p>排球聯賽已應時令而產出，即將於七月二日在入仙橋靑年會展開序寡。按排球賽事自變以後與足監平均發展，每次極其鬧緊，惜乎其水準迄未提高。我人可回憶當年曹廷贊丘廣　衛鼎　之猛擊，周達雲黎連澤之妙托扣殺。其神妙之技，目下實不能再覩。即稱雄於現在棑壇者，亦俱為一般老將如譚永湛江德元郭炳坤等，喧赫於時，後起者望　莫及。女子排球亦然，若黃杏芬已運續十餘年固未能有進者超越，李波已育子女，猶不見遜人。可見後來無人。本屆排球聯賽，各路雄師，正在擦掌摩拳，準備一顯身手。華者極願有盛况之外，最希望水準之提高焉。此點果屬千端萬結，原因　多。要之，如能注意下列二點，當不無裨益也。</p>
<h3 id="c53">塲地 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>關於排球場地，有謂室內較室外爲佳室外較室內為適合。各具理由，是否難斷。唯鄙意應以塲外者為住。最明　者，炎夏天氣，困於一室，如看客衆多，殊非衛生之道。我人再回思前弘毅盃比賽時，亦為場外操場。例於夜上舉行，裝置電燈，光綫充足，四週地位寬敞，發揮較易。惜今電流限制，恐難做到。本屆聯賽最好在室外舉行。如此則塲地廣空氣足，球員易於振起精神，　演出色。但此時此地，不知能否如願以　乎？</p>
<h3 id="c54">裁判 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>各項球賽，裁判之關係最為重要，其緊張之比賽，可由裁判之一言而操縱。排球賽何獨不然，且更甚於其他球賽。蓋如遇網觸網重接等球，可以誤　　，無法提出抗議。如最近在某排球友誼賽中，記者目覩某裁判之錯誤百出，以此而使球員作戰精神渙散，演出由高度而降低，此實因裁判之不良乃造成演出之惡劣。過去亦屢見此種現象。故深望本屆裁判會方面，特被鄭重，</p>
<p>最後記者探悉目下各隊之情形，約略記之。</p>
<p>男子甲組　有粵華，華影，中北，白隊，永安隊等，正在厲兵之中。唯其中人事問　頗多在未定之天，尙須經過一番拉攏為定。以日下所探悉者，常以粵華為最整齊，如郭炳坤馬燦希陳學祟金郇中原則儉箏好乎，均在名單上。如以後無變化，則該隊大有希望焉。而中北華影兩隊，則多人選衝突者，當須視正式報名後而定。</p>
<p>女子組　綠隊自榮　藍球圓門球兩項冠車後，排球隊亦應時成立。細察其名單，確亦具奪標之雌心。老將如黃杏芳祝士芳等聞風來歸。所見該隊有搜盡各球賽之錦標，中　之心，令人敬佩！唯本屆三省華達等隊，寶力亦屬不凡。我敢斷本屆女子演出，或有稍事提高水可能。願各隊勤加訓練，有新人才發現，則幸甚！克　勃林基却利勃脫沙可金取隆及奧柴遼七員，　流出陣。</p>

<h3 id="c56">本報助學金籃球義賽　中西靑決賽評述 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>中華靑年會及西僑靑年會藍球隊，爲籌募本報助學金，舉行籃球義賽，業於上週一三五，在入仙橋靑年會健身房舉行，採用三賽二勝制。一二兩戰，雙方各勝一局，戰情已誌上期本刋。十六日為決定勝負之最後一戰，彼此均以盛譽所繫，常然不肯數衍從事。觀衆亦以中靑第二戰（初戰二十三對十八中靑勝，二戰二十九對十一西靑勝）敗績過慘，必力雪前恥，知有一番劇關，故是晚倍形擁擠。</p>
<p>雙方陣容</p>
<p>中靑塲於第二戰調度失宜，致遭慘敗，對於此役，兵將調遺，特別審愼。經領隊張溎祥，與隊長余　子商量之下，決意選挑華聯之范　公　錫麟張　備吳成章，及仁餘之馬燦為五員號將。終此一戰，未見掉換，卒告勝利，張君等厥功甚偉。西靑仍用凱旋密洛夫浮尼克陶勃林革却利勃脫沙司金耶龍及奧柴遼七員，輪流出陣。</p>
<p>西青戰術</p>
<p>西再沿作風，仍用人釘人法（Man　to　man），賴其身高力强，動作敵活，頗佔便宜。每一投射，必俟長人浮尼克守住敵籃，然後發球，則萬一不中，浮尼克可以接住再撩。同時却利勃脫等，乘機　進，預備爭奪　球，不易被對方接去。</p>
<p>中靑攻守</p>
<p>是日中靑採用聯防法（Zone）。防守時，更用聯防法中之釘人式。上半時攻勢，微嫌呆純，獲球後，未能出敵不意，直搗黃龍。往往略一躊躇，對方即已佈防週密，不易深入敵營。後半時，頗見敏捷。防守方法，似經詳細計劃，范慶公用字形穿走式，　斷西靑形攻勢。吳成章始終　住長人浮尼克，有時將其擋在板後，有時引出圈外，致彼方持球人，不敢輕於發射，因此動作大見遲緩。惜西靑進攻時，吳成章引開浮尼兄，地位過於靠後，未能　成梅花形，否則一人可擋雙敵，范慶公與張顯崙，不致疲於奔命。</p>
<p>勝負關鍵</p>
<p>籃球原係一種智勇兼需之運動，綜觀此役，西靑勇力有餘，機智不足，故其退守進攻，除因襲釘人及形攻勢之舊法外，毫無新奇計謀。反觀中靑，頗能截長補短，儘　發揮藍球運動之特具精神，克敵致果，確非容易（比賽結果為二十五對二十）。是日西靑獲球權極少，亦為失敗要因之一。上半時，僅佔七入分鐘，下半時之獲球機會，亦僅六七分鐘。</p>
<p>觀衆態度</p>
<p>比賽時，裁判員之責任，固極重要，而處，例如：中靑獲得罰球外慣例，人多之一方，可以用數球練習，是日中靑三隊，共有十餘人之多，每人僅有一　機會），致投擲不中。觀衆每逢中靑獲得罰球機會時，乃呼喊啓促，反使投射者心寒手　，宜其十五次中，僅中四次也。　至比賽將終，更有人高喊：「慢慢敎！」「不要急！」「辰光差不多哉！」似更失去吾禮護古邦文明國人之風度矣</p>
<p>籃球精義</p>
<p>筆者對於滬人東視藍球員個人技術，認為有加以糾正之必要。原籃球之組織，重在義成彼此之間，能通力合作，互相援助，優良球員，成知行動集團化之藍球精義。馬燦希之可取，即在於此，未可以得分多寡，作爲評等標準。是以歐美藍球比賽，不日某隊與某隊比賽，而日某敎陳（Coach）與某敎綀比賽；蓋衝鋒陷陣，固由球員身任，而發號司令，帷幄中另有運籌人在也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: The Negation of Selfishness <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yuen-Di Yu-Song, speaking at Shanghai University on "The Path Forward for Chinese Youth," said that the central idea of Buddhism lies in the negation of selfishness. He also said that Eastern morality originates in cultivating oneself and managing one's family, extending to governing the country and bringing peace to the world. One who cannot conquer the thief in his heart, how can he possibly eliminate the thieves in the world? Therefore, a spirit of fairness and selflessness is absolutely essential. Dedicating oneself to one's village, community, and nation, rather than solely focusing on one's own interests, is of utmost importance. Mr. Yu-Song therefore hoped that Chinese youth would first cultivate noble morals, so that they could save China.</p>
<p>The words quoted above can be said to be the traditional spirit of Eastern nations, the driving force that has allowed Eastern nations to endure for so long. However, in the past hundred years, the Chinese people have been infected by Anglo-American ideas; egoism and utilitarianism have at least deeply imprinted themselves in the minds of urban residents. If this mindset is allowed to continue, the Chinese nation-state will inevitably move towards self-destruction, and every Chinese citizen will become a stateless Jew. All those concerned about the future of the nation cannot but loudly denounce and attack this selfish mentality. Although the target of the attack may be a certain individual or group, the starting point of the attack lies solely in correcting the selfish mentality and does not imply any ill will towards any particular individual or group. Friendly foreign figures who are concerned about China's problems and willing to assist in China's revival also frequently voice similar opinions; now, Mr. Yu-Song can be said to be representative of them.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the most important port subjected to Anglo-American cultural invasion. Shanghai citizens, under such circumstances, are at least consciously or unconsciously tainted with some degree of selfishness. Especially before the recovery of the concessions, relying on special privileges, most people followed the Anglo-American enemies, doing things solely for their own benefit. Due to the abnormal development of commerce, almost all Shanghai citizens became merchants who were only interested in profit. Because money could buy personal enjoyment, almost all Shanghai citizens became believers in money worship. Common upstarts are even more the standard of utilitarianism and egoism, and are most likely to shake the will of ordinary wavering citizens in society, which over time will affect the entire society. Just look at Shanghai's abnormal prosperity in recent years, the decline of Shanghai's social morality, and the weakness of Shanghai's social will; everywhere indicates that Shanghai is not on the right track but is instead treading a crooked path.</p>
<p>One must know that in a society or nation, the extreme development of individual nationalism indicates the extreme decline of the society or nation. When the society or nation regresses to the point where it cannot exist and is destroyed, the individual citizen will also fundamentally cease to exist and perish together. Historical precedents are countless, and Shanghai is now walking down this path to destruction. How can this not cause people to worry and panic? This social psychology is deeply rooted and its symptoms are already critical. If it is not treated now, it will inevitably be incurable in the future. In order to revitalize the psychology of Shanghai people and to save Shanghai's future, it is necessary to eradicate this social psychological malady from its roots with the greatest determination. The government should use political power to sanction it, and society should use the power of public opinion to criticize it. We must gather the strength of all sides to attack the same goal. If we do not eliminate this thief in our hearts, Shanghai has no future.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Planes Night Raid Saipan Island, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Enemy Boat Groups; U.S. Ship Crew Shortages Increasingly Serious <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft, in cooperation with land forces, bombed enemy boat groups near Cape Achigan and Obiamu in southern Saipan Island on the night of the 21st, inflicting heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the United States changed its shipbuilding plan, resolutely converting Liberty ships into Victory ships, the shortage of ship crews has become increasingly serious. Although efforts have been made to minimize the number of crew members on Liberty ships, Victory ships require more crew members than Liberty ships. Furthermore, with the recent construction of medium-sized cargo ships of 4,000 tons, the shortage of crew members will become even more acute. The U.S. government has made every effort to train crew members. The shipbuilding plan for this year totals 2,161 ships, requiring more than 7,100 ordinary and senior crew members. In addition, it is still necessary to fill the crew shortages, with the shortage of engineers among the senior crew members being the most severe. To seek countermeasures, the Maritime Transport Bureau's Merchant Marine Training Department has specially added merchant shipping schools directly under its jurisdiction. They quickly become crew members after only three months of training, and their capabilities are naturally quite poor.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops Advance Towards Hengyang Along the Xiang River; Chongqing Authorities Evacuate Population <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Hunan and Henan is as follows: The Chongqing military authorities announced that Japanese troops are advancing southward towards Hengyang along both the east and west banks of the Xiang River, and admitted that the right wing of the Japanese army has advanced to Xiangxiang (88 kilometers north of Hengyang), while the left wing has occupied Liling (120 kilometers northeast of Hengyang). Furthermore, in Henan, the Japanese troops are advancing south from the east of the Pinghan Railway, and have advanced 48 li towards Zhengyang. Therefore, the connection between the Japanese positions south of Zhengzhou on the Longhai Railway and east of Xinyang is only 48 kilometers away, which can be completed soon.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Radio, the Chongqing military authorities admitted on the 21st that Changsha had fallen, and stated that the authorities had been actively and forcibly evacuating the population from Hengyang, the provincial capital of Hunan, for several days. It is reported that this evacuation work is now largely completed.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chongqing Troops' Fighting Spirit Declines <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tsumiyama, information officer of the Third Section of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, met with the Chinese press corps stationed in Japan on the afternoon of the 21st, and spoke about the Changsha operation and the decline of the morale of the Chongqing troops, stating the following: The Japanese army has captured Changsha in this Hunan operation. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is that it is completely different from the previous situation. Usually, after the Japanese army attacked Changsha, the Chongqing troops would withdraw in full, so the city was not affected by the war at all and was safely handed over to the Japanese army. The replenishment of the Chongqing troops is extremely weak, and it is questionable whether the United States' arms lending to Chongqing can actually be implemented. Even if there is some lending, it is limited to the troops based on the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing. Other local troops have not received any lending. In this Hunan operation, the Japanese army, with skillful tactics, has specifically dealt heavy blows to the U.S. and British forces stationed in Chongqing, who are disrupting Asian stability, and to the Chongqing troops, who are running dogs of the Anglo-Americans and trampling on the Chinese people, while avoiding, as much as possible, causing the innocent people to suffer from the war. As for the morale of the Chongqing troops, as evidenced by the fact that a large number of Chongqing troops surrendered to the National Government during the Henan operation, it is clear that the Chongqing troops no longer have the same fighting spirit as before.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chongqing Planes Attack Japanese Navy at Jinggang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base in Hunan, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The various units of the Japanese Army in Central China launched an offensive in the plains of Hunan on May 27th. At the same time, the Japanese naval forces also began an offensive along the Changsha route of the Xiang River. On the morning of June 6th, they captured Yingtian (a key point along the Xiang River). Afterwards, they continued to attack Changsha by water, and finally broke into Jinggang (40 kilometers northwest of Changsha) on the 17th, completely occupying it. Among them, the Xiang River offensive operation between Jinggang at the mouth of Dongting Lake, a distance of approximately 100 kilometers, was completed after many hardships. Since the Xiang River is the main waterway of the entire Hunan province, the Xiang River is the economic lifeline of the province. Now that most of this waterway is in the hands of the Japanese army, it is a great blow to the Chongqing side. Therefore, the Chongqing air force stubbornly attacked the Japanese naval forces. For example, near Jinggang, the Chongqing air force often attacked with joint formations of fighter-bombers numbering about 30 to 40 aircraft. The Japanese naval forces used anti-aircraft artillery to inflict considerable losses on the Chongqing forces and repelled them.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Movement Trends of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force previously used Kunming, Yunnan Province, as its central base, and scattered several large and small reserve airfields around it as supply bases for the entire Chinese front. At the same time, it also established a forward base in Guilin, and built a number of base groups centered on it in a fan-shaped border area to the northeast, including Hengyang, Lingling, Suichuan, and Jian'ou, thereby strengthening the air power of southwest China. The Japanese Air Force has continuously attacked them and monitored the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, sometimes thwarting the U.S. Air Force's attempts. Before the U.S. planes bombed northern Kyushu on the 16th, it launched a surprise attack on Lingling and Hengyang on the 10th, destroying 13 Chongqing planes. Then, on the 11th, it launched an air raid on Suichuan, destroying 35 Chongqing planes in one fell swoop (including large aircraft). On the 12th, it launched a surprise attack on Enshi (Hubei) and Liangshan (Sichuan), destroying 12 Chongqing planes of various sizes. Furthermore, on the 13th, it bombed Jian'ou (now regarded as the most powerful airfield for attacking the Japanese mainland), destroying its runway and auxiliary facilities, rendering it unusable. Now, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, with its war-making capacity in southwest China suffering under the continuous pressure and frustration from the Japanese Air Force, seems to be planning to move to the northwest region in order to avoid the sharp advance of the Japanese Air Force. According to Japanese reconnaissance planes, the number of bases in Hanzhong (central Shaanxi Province) and other airfields has recently been increased. It is also reported that Shiji, Tianshui on the Longhai Railway, and Lanzhou in Gansu Province are also powerful bases for the Chongqing Air Force. The movement of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force from southwest China to the northwest is, in fact, a crucial indicator of the future movements of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, so its movements are worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Beiping, 22nd (Central News Agency) – At approximately 10:00 PM on the 22nd, a large Chongqing aircraft appeared in the Beiping area. The Japanese army took air defense measures, and the Chongqing aircraft was unable to accomplish anything and quickly left.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Havas report: U.S. troops near Carentan are apparently seeking to expand their bridgehead to the west and southwest, and are seeking to clear the German obstacle positions south of Quineville. It is believed that the U.S. troops will launch another offensive in the Prautot area, as the U.S. troops were driven back after breaking into the German positions in the area on Tuesday. There were no reports of fighting south of the Carentan bridgehead yesterday. The Canadian 3rd Division, which suffered heavy losses in the early stages of the war, has reappeared in the area east of the Orne River. The weather in the battle area was good yesterday, and it could almost be described as true early summer weather.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas: Sources report that the Allied headquarters announced on Wednesday evening that fierce fighting is taking place in the Tilly area.</p>
<p>Field Marshal Rundstedt issued a command, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Havas report: The General Headquarters of the German forces on the four fronts announced that, up to June 20th, the German forces had destroyed no less than 650 Allied tanks, a number roughly equivalent to the strength of four and a half British tank divisions. Furthermore, in the first two weeks of the invasion of Europe, approximately 5,000 British, American, and Canadian soldiers were captured. The number of enemy soldiers killed is estimated to be over 100,000, while the number of wounded and sick is countless.</p>

The German leader replied by telegram, thanking the Japanese Prime Minister and expressing his belief that final victory could certainly be secured. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also exchanged telegrams, expressing in sincere terms that they would continue to fight together to defeat the Anglo-Americans.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese airman Warrant Officer Teigen Motomura, when enemy U.S. planes raided northern Kyushu at dawn on the 16th, stepped forward to intercept the enemy planes, first shooting down an enemy B-29 aircraft that was supposedly invincible, and subsequently shooting down or destroying three more enemy planes, achieving outstanding military achievements. Chief of Staff Tojo, to commend his outstanding achievements, presented him with a military sword and a reward, which was delivered to the warrant officer by the Chief of Staff of the Western Army on the 21st.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A German news agency, citing an official German war report, stated: The enemy forces in the Normandy theater launched several offensives against the German encirclement east of the Orne River yesterday, but were all repulsed. The enemy forces launched another offensive against the Cherbourg fortress with large reconnaissance units, but were also repulsed. General Helmich, commander of the 243rd German Infantry Division, heroically fell in battle on June 17th while defending the Cherbourg Peninsula.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas correspondent Insen reported: The Allied forces launched a concentrated attack on the Cherbourg fortress. The German forces, with a smaller force, continue to destroy the facilities of the port. Most of the port facilities are already unusable, and navigation of ships has also been blocked. Countermeasures to prevent naval attacks by the Allied powers have also been implemented. Allied battleships and cruisers seem to have abandoned shelling around Cherbourg, probably due to the power of German artillery. The German side has done its best to thoroughly destroy all port facilities in Cherbourg to prevent the enemy from using the port after its abandonment. German officials believe that, under the current circumstances, Cherbourg can be held for a considerable period of time, even if the German forces cannot launch a rescue offensive on the Cotentin Peninsula. If the Allied forces want to carry out a large-scale landing elsewhere, they must do so after occupying Cherbourg. Therefore, the main ground battle will have to be developed until the second phase of the war.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to U.S. sources, the invasion forces' command announced that U.S. infantry, with the assistance of artillery and aircraft, have entered the southern outskirts of Cherbourg. Cherbourg will soon be occupied. The German defense of Cherbourg is extremely sophisticated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas reported: According to the United Press in London, U.S. forces yesterday joined the final battle for Cherbourg, the third largest port in France. With the aid of artillery fire, they attacked the city's inner defense fortifications. It is also reported that the German defenders of the city have rejected the Allied forces' request for surrender, and the German forces are currently destroying the port facilities, causing heavy smoke to obscure the sky. It is also heard that Field Marshal Rommel has ordered the Cherbourg defenders to defend the city to the death.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry remained silent on the Finnish issue yesterday. Regarding the Swedish reports that the Finnish cabinet will be reorganized and that Foreign Minister Ryesi may become Prime Minister, a spokesperson hinted and said that Marshal Mannerheim would be in a very important position in this matter. The spokesperson also mentioned that the Swedish Communist Party's newspaper stated that the Soviet offensive was carried out with the consent of the Anglo-Americans. The newspaper cited a certain U.S. broadcast as proof, saying that when the Anglo-Americans put pressure on Finland, the Soviets had already set their timetable.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, Finnish Ambassador to the U.S. Procope, who was expelled by the U.S. government, left the U.S. yesterday with two counselors from the embassy to return to his country. It is not yet known which route he will take.</p>

<p>Helsinki, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas reported: On the day of the completion of training for young officers, Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim issued a message saying: We have steadfastly fought for a long time, and the war is fierce. Our army must work harder. The capabilities and fighting spirit of the Finnish army will encounter more severe tests. Defending the coast is the key to the Finnish front. Warships and coastal batteries share the heavy responsibility of coastal defense. General Mannerheim also encouraged the new officers to be brave and calm, loyal to the country, and to be role models for future generations.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Review Work of the Rice and Grain Problem in Various Regions Has Been Lagging Behind <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the rice control committee and the determination of specific procurement policies have been too far behind schedule. Procurement began one to two months later than usual, thus missing the most important procurement period. Work in various regions began in late November or early December. The rice control committee committed a great error at its inception, or even before its inception. Moreover, not only did the start time come too late, but the loan of funds was also too slow, and procurement prices were announced without any preparation. The prices were not based on the prices offered by farmers, but on the prices at which purchasing merchants delivered to the rice control committee. The result after the announcement was a sharp rise in market prices. People in the four regions all pointed to this as the main reason. This failure is worthy of attention. These people certainly do not disparage the various reasons pointed out by the offices of the Songjiang and Kunshan rice control committees, but are people who have personally felt the difficulty of procurement in a harsh environment. Even if this harsh environment exists, if the rice control committee had not delayed in establishing an institution in Shanghai, and had ordered the lower-level institutions to carry out procurement at the same time as the harvest, at least a considerable amount of procurement could have been achieved. After the announcement of the procurement policy of the rice control committee last year, the reporter held a symposium for procurement operators in Changshu. At that time, the overall opinion was the same as above. Therefore, this failure was not only clear after implementation, but its failure was expected before implementation. The reporter personally witnessed the people of Changshu gritting their teeth and standing by when the new rice appeared on the market. This failure is different in nature from the case of no follow-up after the procurement of cotton yarn and cloth, which led to a major flaw in the policy. From the beginning, it cannot be said to have been a good strategy, and it is something that the National Government authorities should reflect upon. The delay in this procurement work, as mentioned earlier, not only caused those who were procured to suffer the pain of procurement difficulties, but also caused farmers to suffer unnecessary hardships. To cite an example, a farmer from Kunshan sent a letter to a procurement merchant, the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>We hope that you can start procurement as soon as possible. After the harvest, we can sell rice to buy enough necessities for life. But the procurement of the merchant designated by the rice control committee is too late, and we have no choice but to sell to other merchants. However, after we sold a considerable amount of rice, we were forced to sell it again, and we had no choice but to sell it a second time. Moreover, at that time, the procurement price and the market price were very different, which was extremely unfavorable for us sellers. Why is it that when there is rice, it is not procured, and when there is no rice, it is forced to be sold? In the future, I hope you will consider the interests of the people, and start procurement earlier and end it earlier.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Quickly Prepare a Fundamental Countermeasure <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Even if the environment is harsh and the policies are imperfect, if the timing of the start of procurement is not so late, the results of the procurement would not be so bad as they are today. There are many people in the mainland who say this, and we must humbly accept it. In order to overcome this lag, the rice control committee must make four or five times more effort. For example, in a certain area, all the preparatory work at the time of the founding of the army was quickly put into practice between March and April. During this period, the amount of rice and grain obtained by the rice control committee in the three months after its establishment was collected in ten days in that area. This is truly an amazing thing.</p>
<p>The reporter asked people from various regions: "If we had started earlier and completed the preparations for the three to four months before the New Year, the procurement could have proceeded smoothly, right?" People from various regions all agreed. The new working methods, as in the recently announced rice and grain methods, do not contain a long list of ten or twenty articles, but only one article: "Quick and decisive." Now is no longer the time to calculate the age of a dead child. What we ask of the National Government and the rice control committee is: has the policy for this year's harvest been decided? Has the preparation for immediate implementation been completed? If the same mistakes as last year are made, no matter how perfect the policy is decided, it will be the same as giving medicine to a dead person. Someone said to the reporter: "Even if you are enthusiastic about preparing, it is useless." These are words that we must not ignore. According to last year's experience, even if the various agencies in the mainland complete all preparations and systems, the announced policy will make those preparations all useless. As a result, the people who cooperate in the preparatory work cannot gain the trust of the farmers.

<h3 id="e19">Director of the Third Department of Propaganda Issues Important Statement Clarifying the Concept of the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army began operations in Henan in April, it has occupied Zhengzhou and Luoyang in succession with the force of a bamboo splitting, thoroughly smashing the Chongqing side's attempt. Last month, it launched operations in Hunan, and Changsha, the key point of Hunan Province, has now been captured by the elite Japanese army. This has greatly impacted the Chongqing side in terms of military affairs and economy. The Director of the Third Department of Propaganda of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army Headquarters, Mr. Mishina, gave a special statement on this matter. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>The forward-deployed Expeditionary Army first attacked Luoyang and Shanxian, the important points of Henan, and opened up the Pinghan Railway, sweeping through the First War Zone of the anti-Japanese regime, destroying its main force. It then turned its attention to the southern region of the Yangtze River, attacking Changsha, the lock of Chongqing's defense of Hunan. In late May, with close cooperation between the army, navy, and air force, it carried out a surprise attack operation, and in a short period of time, it eliminated the main force of the Chongqing army in the Ninth War Zone in the surrounding areas. On June 18th, it completely captured Changsha, and is currently conducting mopping-up operations in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Army is to use the justice of the Greater East Asia War to overthrow the Anglo-American imperialist forces that are sacrificing China to realize their ambitions of aggression in East Asia, to secure a strategic line of defense for the mainland, so that the Chinese nation can break away from Anglo-American oppression and aggression as soon as possible, move towards the path of liberation, and then complete the historical mission of unification and nation-building. Therefore, the war that has been shaking the mainland since this spring is based on the unwavering belief and active combat operations of the Japanese Expeditionary Army, which transcends the enemy's fragile psychology of all doubts, speculations, fears, and anxieties.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Reality Shatters Illusion <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>As for the capture of cities and the destruction of resistance forces, the daily triumphs of war are not what the Japanese Expeditionary Army concerns itself with. However, there is something that must be clarified and warned about, both internally and externally, and that is the delusion and hope towards England, America, and Chongqing. Namely, that Japan's national power is exhausted due to entanglements and drains in the Pacific or Asian regions, losing its offensive capacity and falling into a state of exhaustion. The current operation serves as a solemn factual demonstration of this, a stern warning of iron and fire, using reality to shatter their illusions. "If the Japanese army in Asia is not completely annihilated, Japan cannot be defeated," a statement first made by the enemy general Nimitz. Subsequently, military commentators like Wien-Ta and special correspondents from American newspapers in Chongqing, such as Ato Kai En-Su, unanimously echoed this sentiment. However, upon closer examination of their words, although containing a significant amount of elements, it can be considered a clear and genuine call, further proving the Japanese Expeditionary Army's continental decisive battle posture and proactive position.</p>
<p>Looking at the battle line starting from the Northwest's Guanimen and Luoyang, far suppressing the fertile lands of Henan to Wuhan, and directly attacking Changsha in Hunan, the Expeditionary Army's mighty general war strength, with its outstanding mobile warfare strategy, is well-matched and methodical. As for Chongqing and the American air force, they have already seized their throat from the Northwest to Sichuan, controlling their fate.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Revealing the True Essence of the Operation <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Currently, wherever the Japanese Expeditionary Army goes in Henan and Hunan, their military operations are like a swift wind sweeping away withered leaves, and their governance of the people is like a spring breeze nurturing all things. Therefore, the children of Luoyang and the elders along the Pinghan Railway line offer water and gruel to welcome them, which is truly touching. The people of Hunan must also eagerly wish to escape the suffering of war. In the future, the people in various post-war areas will be able to live in peace and enjoy happiness. The Expeditionary Army has been fighting on the continent for seven years, experiencing countless hardships, but today its military appearance is solid, its strength is growing daily, and it can continue to advance. Wherever the Expeditionary Army goes today, the discipline is strict and orderly, so the people, unknowingly, replace all the unrealistic dreams and resentments of the past with new trust. When Commander-in-Chief Yan’s conversation was published during the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance last autumn, it declared the fundamental spirit of the Expeditionary Army’s command. Therefore, the Expeditionary Army, from top to bottom, consistently upholds the fundamental concept of the continental war, and its true essence has been fully demonstrated in this operation.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Revising Air Defense Regulations: Authorities Explain Significance: Announcement by the Japanese Army Air Defense Command <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Air Defense Command, noting that in the past, when alert warnings were issued in the city, vehicles did not stop, causing considerable traffic chaos, issued Notification No. 24 on the 20th to amend this. This amendment is because, after an alert warning is issued, detecting the movement of enemy aircraft relies on auditory perception, which is hindered by constant noise. Therefore, this amendment was made. Recognizing the importance of the matter, the Air Defense Command authorities issued a statement on the 22nd, explaining the significance of the amendment in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Item (B) of the notification stipulates that five minutes after the local alert warning is issued, cars and other vehicles may begin to travel at a speed of 20 miles or less, and pedestrians may resume walking, provided they do not hinder air defense work or cause traffic accidents. The term "local alert warning" is used because the sounding of alert sirens is not consistent throughout the city. Some sirens are not sounded until five minutes or more after the Air Defense Headquarters issues the alert. Therefore, the time when the local alert is issued is used as the standard. Because the time when local alerts are sounded varies, the time when traffic stops and resumes also varies, and may not coincide with the time when the Air Defense Command issues the alert. This must be noted. Pedestrians should follow the regulations in the notification and go to nearby shelters or the outer edges of roads immediately after the alert is issued.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an air raid warning may be sounded immediately without issuing an alert warning. In this case, noise and traffic control are even more necessary. All vehicles and pedestrians must stop traffic as before. Also, after an alert warning is issued, if there is no suitable shelter or air raid shelter nearby, pedestrians should return home quickly ten minutes after the local alert is issued. Furthermore, the authorities have repeatedly called attention to the fact that blackout measures are incomplete, and there are many light leaks, which is regrettable. Those who do not have blackout equipment should turn off the lights immediately after the alert is issued and not turn them on until the alert is lifted. Violators will have their electricity supply cut off as a minor warning. It is hoped that all citizens of Shanghai will be encouraged to fully understand the purpose of this notification, obey the command of the authorities, and strictly observe noise and traffic control.</p>

During the banquet, Minister Usami gave a speech, saying: “Our embassy has always received support, for which we are deeply grateful. Shanghai is the center of China's economy and culture, and also the place where Sino-Japanese relations are closely developed. I am very willing to make efforts in this role, and I hope that the mayor and everyone will give me more guidance. Tonight, I offer this glass of wine to express my respect, and I hope everyone will enjoy themselves.” The Mayor replied, saying, "I have often received invitations, but I have not had the opportunity. I am very happy to be invited tonight. I remember when I first met the Minister, it was in Tokyo. I have long admired the Minister's reputation and his aspirations for Sino-Japanese cooperation. I extend my warmest welcome to his post in Shanghai. Shanghai is currently in a difficult period, but fortunately, the administration has been unified. I am confident that close cooperation between China and Japan will overcome the difficulties. Recently, the city will be re-divided into districts. This has been discussed for a long time, and it is thanks to the Minister's assistance that it will soon be realized. I would like to express my gratitude here, and I wish you good health."</p>

However, due to various reasons, the deadline was extended by ten days to July 10. There is no limit to the amount of donation, but no excuse for non-payment is allowed. If various industries have no iron to donate, they may automatically obtain it and then donate it. Each household will only be allowed to donate once. If they have already donated and provide evidence, they can apply for exemption. Those who deliberately refuse to donate will be reported by the Economic Bureau to the Municipal Government for an order to suspend business.</p>

<p>The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau, in order to crack down on illegal hoarding, issued a statement on the 19th of this month, with very detailed content. Its explanation of hoarding is that all industries or factories that hoard materials that are deemed to increase production during wartime will not be punished. However, those who attempt to monopolize the market for huge profits are not included in this exception. In addition, the patrol team of the office in plain clothes only investigates hoarding and does not exercise the power of detention. This refers specifically to the previous investigation of rice. Furthermore, plainclothes officers are also dispatched for other work, and they can exercise the power of detention. For fear of misunderstandings from all walks of life, a special explanation is given above.</p>

<p>Since various parties have made efforts to transport rice to Shanghai, the rice merchants have achieved considerable results in transportation, and the rice is continuously being shipped to Shanghai, and the price continues to fall. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e28">Eleven Temporary Passport Offices <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The general public’s enthusiastic rush to the Grain Control Committee to fill out application forms and obtain temporary certificates for moving more than five dou and less than ten shi of rice is overwhelming. From morning to night, the crowds are unbearable. The staff of the Third Section of the Transportation Office of the Association is extremely busy, and the procedures for issuing certificates are extremely fast, with the amount of certificates issued reaching over 120,000 shi per day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Temporary Passport Office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee has determined the location of the office at 11 locations: Hongqiao Road, Hu Min Road, Chang'an Road, Fuxing Road, Zhoujiaqiao, North Station, Jianghai Customs, Longhua Town, South Pier, Zhongshan Road, Guangxin Road, Jiangwan, etc., and appointed Tang Hongyi, Xian Xingnan, Tan Zanchen, Liu Zhisheng, Hong Sen, Takahashi Hiroshi, Tanaka Shigesaburo, Wang Zefang, Yun Shizhou, Sun Shaonong, Ojiko Sadano, Xu Yanpei, and others as directors. Each office has 6-7 staff members, and the Security Office sends security teams to various offices to maintain order. Because the crowds applying for certificates have been overwhelming in recent days, various offices will start issuing certificates within two or three days to facilitate the application of citizens and rice merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Revising the Price of Comprehensive Rationing <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The price of rice for the Rice and Grain Control Committee, which was previously stipulated, differs too much from the cost of the rice recently purchased by rice merchants. In order to take into account the cost of rice merchants, a decision was made to increase the newly revised price several times to show understanding.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee are actively planning the temporary measures for Shanghai's citizens' food management and are comprehensively formulating policies. Once everything is in place, it can be adjusted and implemented for rationing.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Strict Investigation of Extortion Reduces Market Prices <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to recent reports from rice merchants dispatched to various places to purchase rice and residents from the suburbs of the city, there are still unscrupulous elements along the way who are making things difficult and attempting to extort money, which has a great impact on the transportation market price. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this and take effective measures to suppress it. There is a clear announcement from the Standing Committee that the transportation of rice by rice merchants is exempt from donations and taxes along the way. If there are any difficulties or extortion, they can report it to the Chongfu government and the Rice Control Committee at any time for investigation.</p>
<p>Rice merchants have begun to purchase rice in various suburbs of the city. Most of this rice is distributed to various rice shops for free sale. The quantity is very large. Yesterday, the rice transported into the city was extremely popular, especially in Zhoujiaqiao and North Station, where each place had 2,000 to 3,000 shi, with the total amount reaching 20,000 shi. As a result, the market price continued to fall. It is said that a large batch of rice arrived at the port yesterday, with eight guan being the price, and even peddlers bargained for around nine guan. According to general observations, if the rice purchased can continue to arrive in Shanghai daily, the market price is likely to continue to fall.</p>

<p>The rice grain committee purchase of rice, the old order complete list sorting method, the food plan has been drafted and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation published later: 凡 All procurement vendors have an order and have not yet delivered the goods in full shall be sorted out in accordance with this method. A. Those who have an order to receive funds, but have not delivered any rice so far, shall be limited to deliver half of the rice by July 15, and deliver the full amount by August 15. B. Those who have an order, receive funds, and have already delivered half of the rice, regardless of whether they continue to borrow the second half of the funds or not, shall be limited to August 15 to deliver the full amount of their order. In order to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, all procurement merchants who have not been able to pay off their order in full may apply for a certificate to transport rice to Shanghai. They will transport the rice to Shanghai, and 40% of the rice will be used to offset the number of orders, and the remaining 60% of the rice may be sold in the Shanghai area at the market price. (The purchase price is still the original public price and the allocation of 30% of materials, and transportation costs will be subsidized when transporting to Shanghai). If the procurement merchants cannot complete the clearing according to the first clause by the due date, they shall be dealt with in accordance with the following methods. A. If the item in the first clause has not been paid in full by July 15, the order procurement merchant will be transferred to the relevant local government or court for punishment in accordance with the law, and the guarantor of the merchant will be severely punished for delivering the rice. If the rice cannot be delivered by August 15, the guarantor will be subject to joint and several punishment, and will be sent to the relevant local government or court to seize the rice, or seal and sell the property of the procurement merchant and the guarantor to compensate for the number, calculated according to the local market price of rice. B. If the item in the first clause has not been paid in full by August 15, the procurement merchant will be transferred to the local court for detention and urged the guarantor to pay the rice. If the rice cannot be delivered by September 30, the guarantor will be transferred to the court for arrest and prosecution, or the property of both the procurement merchant and the guarantor will be sealed and sold to compensate for the loss. The number shall be calculated according to the local market price of rice. After the procurement merchant signs the contract, if the procurement merchant himself is not responsible, but difficulties arise due to other reasons, and he cannot fulfill the contract, after reporting to the Association for verification and verification, the joint punishment method may be reduced and approved separately. This method is presented to the Executive Yuan</p>

<h3 id="e42">A Glimpse of the European Landing Battle <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Launch of the Invasion</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, at 1:00 AM, British and American airborne commandos landed on the coast of France north of the Kessel Island. At 1:30 AM, the British 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions landed between the Havre-Orne River estuary. The American 8th, 2nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions landed between the Orne River estuary and Cherbourg, aiming to secure landing points. The points of attack were at Barfleur, Carentan, Isigny, and Tourlaville.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the anti-Axis fleet, covering the landing troops, was assembled between the English Channel and Kessel Island. At 5:30 AM, amid thundering barrage, landing craft groups and airborne troops of the Anglo-American forces surged toward various locations. The German defense forces swiftly and calmly launched a counterattack, engaging the naval fleet with coastal artillery and torpedo boat squadrons. On the ground, on the same day before noon, the airborne commandos in the Barfleur, Seine River, and Orne River areas were annihilated. By dusk, the anti-Axis forces between Kessel Island and the Havre-Cherbourg area were either annihilated or forced back to sea, with only a portion of the landing forces remaining in a small area 20 kilometers wide and 2 kilometers deep near Alemanni on the banks of the Orne River.</p>
<p>According to a communiqué from the German Führer's headquarters, the enemy's landing operation on the northern coast of Normandy, between the ports of Havre and Cherbourg, has been covered by naval fire since the morning of the 7th. Many airborne commandos who landed behind the fortresses aimed to support the landing operation and prevent German reinforcements, but they suffered heavy losses upon landing due to anti-aircraft fire and were cleared out after a short interception. The enemy forces that landed from the sea successfully gained footholds at several locations. However, most of the bridgeheads that were built were destroyed by German counterattacks, and the coast was littered with the wreckage of landing craft.</p>
<p>Fierce fighting is currently underway at the mouth of the Orne River and north of Carentan, and the enemy forces holding the bridgeheads are being pressured by German forces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the morning of the 6th, German torpedo boats attacked the enemy's main fleet in the Bay of Seine.</p>
<p>The Terrain of Normandy</p>
<p>The Normandy peninsula in northern France is named after the Normans, who invaded across the dangerous waves of the North Sea over a thousand years ago. The Normandy region faces the English Channel, with a hilly area approximately 200 to 150 meters high from the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel to the Bresle River. The cultivated fields are vast, the villages are sparse, and the valleys are hidden in the forests. From January to September, the slopes of the mountains are covered with snow-white apple blossoms, making for a beautiful and pleasant scenery.</p>
<p>The coastline consists of gray-white cliffs, like screens, below which are steep rocky reefs, stretching narrowly. The estuaries of the Seine River and the Vire River, etc., all gather in the trumpet-shaped Bay of Seine, connecting to Cherbourg, an area of flat terrain with white sand and green pines, making it an excellent place for landing. If the enemy establishes a bridgehead in the Normandy peninsula and advances into the interior of Europe, then advancing into the Paris Basin from here would be ideal. Moreover, the road network here is well-connected, which can be utilized, making it the best place for the German mobile forces to be active.</p>
<p>The Seine River and the Paris Basin meander between the fingers. From Rouen, the Seine River communicates with Le Havre. The Seine River to the suburbs of Paris is also navigable by small vessels, so there is reason for the enemy to choose this as a landing site. Le Havre is located at the mouth of the Seine River, serving as the outer port of Paris. It is one of France's leading ports, with a population of 158,000, accounting for a quarter of France's national trade before the war. The streets are wide and there are many beautiful views, and it is considered a modern city among the antique cities.</p>
<p>Cherbourg is located at the northern end of the Normandy peninsula, connecting Calais and Dieppe, serving as a key port for controlling the strait closest to England. Louis X had already planned to establish it as a naval port during his reign, and Napoleon built it into a large-scale naval port, making it a famous naval port in France. The nearby Cotentin coast is humid, with continuous green fields and thriving livestock farming.</p>
<p>Caen is a quiet hilly area south of the Seine River, with an elevation of less than 100 meters. With a plain at its center, it was only engaged in animal husbandry until the beginning of this century. After coal was discovered in the south, it leaped to become an industrial center, and the population also exceeded 50,000. There are many stone buildings on the streets, and relics of medieval architecture such as the Abbey of Saint-Étienne and the Château de Caen still remain.</p>
<p>The islands of Jersey and Guernsey, where the landing forces were completely annihilated by the German forces, are the largest islands in the Channel Islands. Geographically, they are close to the Normandy peninsula and were under British control before this war. Jersey has an area of 28 square miles and a population of 5,000, while Guernsey has an area of 16 square miles and a population of over 4,000. Although they are British territories, they are fully immersed in French culture, and the local customs are completely Frenchified. The south coast of Jersey has a large bay and beautiful sandy beaches, and London tourists flock here to escape the cold in winter.</p>
<p>Enemy Commanders</p>
<p>The Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in the European offensive campaign is the American General Eisenhower, with the British General Tedder as the deputy commander. Below them are the commanders of the land, sea, and air forces. The background of each person is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Eisenhower is 54 years old and was born in Texas, USA. He grew up as a farmer in the Kansas cornfields during his youth. Judging from his surname, his ancestors were actually Germans who immigrated to the United States. He graduated from Kansas University, the Army Infantry Warfare School, the Army War College, and the Engineering Department. He initially had no reputation, but was later valued by General MacArthur, the commander of the Philippines, and appointed as his chief of staff, thus showing his talent. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he was recalled to Washington and appointed as the Deputy Chief of the Operations Planning Division of the US General Staff, dedicating himself to drafting the plans for the North African landing. In June 1941, he was appointed as the US Commander of Operations in Europe, and in November of the same year, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, achieving fame in one fell swoop. His personality is brave and resolute, as can be seen from his decision to choose the most heavily defended European fortress for the landing.</p>
<p>Tedder is 55 years old and graduated from the History Department of Cambridge University. He entered the Air Force Department from army service. In 1936, he was appointed as the British Far East Commander, and the following year as the Middle East Air Force Commander. Since 1941, he has served as the Air Force Commander in the Mediterranean region and is also known for his role in the North African campaign. In February last year, at Tedder's suggestion, the British Air Force Department established a new "Operational Air Force Unit" and a "Strategic Air Force Unit" within the Coastal Air Force Command to conduct organized bombing of Europe. As a result of this opportunity, he was appointed as the Deputy Commander of the European Invasion Force.</p>
<p>The Commander of the land forces of the European Invasion Force, British General Montgomery, is known for his "steadiness." He is 58 years old, born in Ireland, and suffered defeat in the Battle of Dunkirk four years ago, but he became prominent again after the end of the North African campaign.</p>
<p>The Naval Commander, British Admiral Ramsay, comes from a distinguished family and has served as the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Fleet. In the current operation in northern France, he commands the fleets of Britain, the United States, Canada, as well as the fleets of the exiled governments of Norway, Poland, the Netherlands, France, and Greece.</p>
<p>German Ingenious Tactics</p>
<p>The German army had made thorough preparations before the launch of the landing battle in Western Europe. It is said that when Field Marshal Rommel, the overall commander of the German army in Europe, once inspected the northern coast of France, he only saw green pastures and miscellaneous flowers growing, and he could not help but exclaim "Wonderful!" The accompanying staff were all surprised, and Field Marshal Rommel turned to his subordinates and said, "Wonderful, beneath these flowers, 80,000 landmines are buried, waiting for the arrival of the enemy." This is one of the ingenious tactics of the Germans. Since the start of the invasion, new and unusual German weapons have emerged one after another. After landing, the anti-Axis air forces have been detonating mines in succession, and the flames have soared into the sky, like a fiery hell. The enemy is using air forces on a large scale this time, which the German side estimates to be four to six divisions strong, with a formation extending up to eighty kilometers. Most of these air forces are transported by large gliders, but more than a thousand of them have been shot down by the German army. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun on June 8, 9, 10, and 12)</p>

In the first week of the European invasion, it is estimated that the anti-Axis forces suffered 85,000 casualties. June 17: The German side bombed London with unmanned aircraft, dropping super-heavy bombs, which greatly shocked the enemy. The British King inspected the bridgehead in northern France. German forces destroyed the Caen sluice gates. June 19: The anti-Axis forces continued to land on the Cotentin Peninsula. German forces fired meteor bombs from the French coast towards England. The American side announced that the European invasion forces had suffered 15,000 casualties. June 20: The German forces on the Cotentin Peninsula retreated towards the Cherbourg fortress area.

<h3 id="e43">The Opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army in North China began its offensive in the Henan Plain, in less than ten days, on May 9, they opened the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway line, a link in the continental longitudinal railway. This operation was even larger in scale and planning than the Battle of Xuzhou and the Battle of Wuhan. After waiting for seven years since the incident, it has finally been realized. Previously, the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou line from Beijing to Xinxiang had already been operated by the Japanese side. The southern section of the Beijing-Hankou line between Hankou and Xinyang had also been restored. The section newly repaired by the Japanese side is the approximately 350-kilometer section between Xinxiang and Xinyang. It is rumored that the tracks and all railway equipment in that section were taken away to the interior by the Russians. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway line is a zone connecting Central China and North China, which is extremely important not only militarily but also politically and economically. The Japanese army in Central China and North China joined hands in Queshan, which is a fatal blow to the Chongqing army that is responding to the Pacific offensive and counterattacking on the mainland.

<p>German Anti-Communist Battle Results: A dispatch from Croatia: The Croatian Military Bureau recently announced the results of the suppression of Communist bandits in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in May as follows: 9,148 deaths, 1,502 injuries, and 2,007 prisoners. They also seized 96 tanks and 21 cannons.</p>
<p>Report on the Lend-Lease Act: Roosevelt explained the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act to a group of journalists on the 2nd of this month as follows: From January 1 to April 1 of this year, in 99 days, the United States supplied 4,400 aircraft to the anti-Axis countries. Since the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act on March 11, 1941, to April 1 of this year, the total number of aircraft supplied has been over 33,000, of which 7,000 were paid in cash, and another 26,000 were supplied under the Lend-Lease Act. Since the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act to April 1 of this year, the total number of aircraft manufactured by the United States has been 175,000, of which three-quarters were retained for use by the US military, and the remainder was supplied to the anti-Axis countries.</p>
<p>US Shipbuilding Amount in May: The US Naval Committee announced shipbuilding results on the 3rd of this month as follows: 150 ships were launched in May, including 16 new "Victoria-type" fast ships. By region, 68 ships were built on the Pacific coast, 45 ships were built on the Atlantic coast, 32 ships were built in the Gulf of Mexico, and 10 ships were built in the Great Lakes region. The shipbuilding rate on the Pacific coast has surpassed that of the Atlantic coast. The total number of ships built from the beginning of this year to the end of May is 790, totaling 7,247,657 tons, an increase of seven ships compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>US Coal Shortage: A dispatch from New York: US Wartime Fuel Administrator Ickes recently gave a speech in Philadelphia, warning the people of the coal shortage. He stated that the current coal reserves are only 51 million tons, which is not enough for one month's demand. If it decreases further, wartime production will be significantly affected.</p>
<p>Landing Steamer: The enemy, the United States, has newly built a type of transport ship for landing, which has been applied in the Southwest Pacific. The ship weighs 5,500 tons, is 320 feet long, has a flat bottom, and can be grounded on the beach. The bottom of the ship has doors that can discharge tanks and soldiers directly onto the shore.</p>
<p>Ring High-Altitude Gun: The British "News Chronicle" recently reported that the US Army Ordnance Department has built a ring high-altitude gun with a caliber of 12 cm at Camp Davis in North Carolina.

<p>US Intensifies Pressure on Northern Europe: A dispatch from Washington: The US State Department announced on the 3rd of this month that 84 Finnish commercial firms have been added to the new blacklist. On the other hand, the US government had previously added 28 Swedish commercial firms to the blacklist, and on the 3rd, it added 53 more. The US seems to be increasingly exerting malicious economic pressure on both countries in Northern Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Preliminary Remarks Before the Public Performance of the National Music Research Association <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Yan</p>
<p>Shanghai can be said to be a city with the most intense musical atmosphere. Compared with other parts of the country, Shanghai citizens have the highest level of interest and appreciation for music. However, since the influx of European culture, Shanghai, which has always been at the forefront of trends, has seen its people immerse themselves in the study of Western music, while the essence of our country's inherent music has become increasingly obscure and unfamiliar. There is little talk of research and improvement, let alone its promotion and development! Currently, general music schools teach only Western music, and so-called musicians all carry violins and play pianos, naturally performing only Western tunes.</p>
<p>In fact, Chinese ancient music, in the course of world music history, can be considered to have developed very early. As early as the Zhou and Qin dynasties, it was listed as one of the Six Arts. By the Tang and Song dynasties, it flourished greatly due to the advocacy of emperors. However, as it has been passed down to the present, because there has been no improvement in the areas of musical notation theory and instrument construction, the essence of the national quintessence has not been preserved, and there is a tendency for it to be lost, which is all the more regrettable.</p>
<p>Every country's music has its own unique national character, and Chinese music naturally has its own unique style. Although we can try our best to abandon shortcomings and adopt strengths, and adopt the forms and techniques of Western music, we must preserve the essence of national music that is representative of our national character!</p>
<p>The characteristic of national music lies in its richness of Eastern sentiment. Its timbre is beautiful, its melodies are both elegant and popular, and its expression of emotions is even more beautiful and graceful. Through the sublime and refined performance of string and wind instruments, it can often unleash a profound power of touching people, stirring up resonance within people's hearts, and exchanging emotions. If we were to symbolize music with colors, then the symphonies of Western music are multi-colored, colorful, while national music is pure, elegant, and rich in the gentle, indifferent, tranquil beauty of sky blue! - Of course, this does not mean that national music is purely composed of quiet melodies. For example, ancient marching songs also have many that are majestic and magnificent, and the splendor, grandeur, and excitement expressed in imperial court music can also rival Western symphonies. In addition, the cries of the people from the streets and alleys, the sufferings of the people, are often conveyed through string and wind instruments in melodies that touch people's hearts. How can national music not be popular and accessible music?</p>
<p>Now, I am happy to report to everyone a piece of good news - the National Music Research Association, in response to the requests of various circles, has decided to hold a public performance at the Lyceum Theatre on the 28th and 29th of this month from 5:30 to 7:30! The National Music Research Association has gathered more than a dozen members who are committed to amateur study with the preservation of national music as their responsibility, and their footprints have even reached overseas, with the intention of promoting national glory. The chairman, Mr. Sun Yu, has humbly researched and explored the ancient music of our country. His musical talent and skills have especially enhanced the association. Its previous public performances have been highly praised by the audience. This time, they will continue their efforts and perform wonderful famous pieces. Mr. Ye Daquan and Ms. Zhao Yuyu will be invited to perform the traditional Wudang swordsmanship, and Ms. Shen Shuqin will sing to add to the fun. It is hoped that this will universally awaken the people's understanding of national music and their interest in studying it together, so that national music can shine brightly on the world's music stage!</p>

<h3 id="e52">Sports The Rise of Volleyball Matches in Season and Their Contribution to this Year's League <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, ball sports in Shanghai have shown a thriving trend, reaching a prosperous autumn. The large number of spectators at each match is proof of this. Even the recently concluded basketball and football games, which were past their season, still caused a sensation. This further proves that promoting sports is originally intended to strengthen the physique of the people and cultivate their spirit of perseverance. It should be carried out regardless of the weather. However, it is always necessary to conform to the season in order to avoid deviating from the original purpose and even harming the body, which would be ideal.</p>
<p>The volleyball league has emerged in season and will soon begin on July 2nd at the Qingnian Hui in Ruixian Bridge. Volleyball matches, after changes, have developed equally with football. Every match is extremely exciting, but unfortunately, their level has not yet improved. We can recall the fierce attacks of Cao Tingzan, Qiu Guang, and Wei Ding, as well as the wonderful sets and spikes of Zhou Dayun and Li Lianze. Such miraculous skills cannot be seen again today. Even those who are currently dominating the volleyball scene are generally veterans such as Tan Yongzhan, Jiang Deyuan, and Guo Bingkun, who are famous for a while, but later generations cannot reach their level. The same is true for women's volleyball. If Huang Xingfen has been playing for more than ten years and has not been surpassed, and Li Bo has had children but is still not inferior to others, it shows that there are no successors. In this year's volleyball league, all the heroes are sharpening their swords and preparing to show their skills. We sincerely hope that in addition to the grand occasion, the most important thing is to improve the level. This point is indeed very complex and has many reasons. In short, if we can pay attention to the following two points, it will be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Venue <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the volleyball venue, some say that indoor is better than outdoor, while others say that outdoor is more suitable than indoor. Each has its own reasons, and it is difficult to judge. However, in my opinion, it should be outdoor. The most obvious point is that in the hot summer weather, being confined to a room, especially with many spectators, is not a healthy practice. Let us recall the previous Hongyi Cup competition, which was also held on an outdoor playground. It was held at night, with electric lights installed, providing sufficient light and spacious surroundings, making it easier to perform. Unfortunately, due to current electricity restrictions, this may be difficult to achieve. It is best to hold this year's league outdoors. In this way, the venue will be wide, the air will be sufficient, and the players will be able to invigorate their spirits and perform excellently. But at this time and in this place, I wonder if this wish can be fulfilled?</p>
<h3 id="e54">Referee <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The role of the referee is the most important in all ball games. In tense matches, the outcome can be manipulated by the referee's words. Volleyball is no exception, and even more so than other ball games. This is because balls such as net touches and double hits can be misunderstood and cannot be protested. Recently, in a volleyball friendly match, the reporter witnessed a referee making numerous mistakes, which caused the players' fighting spirit to dissipate and the performance to decline from a high level. This was indeed due to the referee's incompetence, which led to the poor performance. This phenomenon has been seen repeatedly in the past. Therefore, it is hoped that the referee committee will pay special attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter learned about the current situation of the teams and recorded it briefly.</p>
<p>The men's Group A includes Yuehua, Huaying, Zhongbei, the White Team, and the Yong'an Team, who are all preparing vigorously. However, personnel issues are still uncertain and need to be resolved through negotiations. As far as we know, Yuehua is the most well-organized, with Guo Bingkun, Ma Canxi, Chen Xueshui, Jin Huanzhong, and Ze Jianzhen all on the list. If there are no changes in the future, the team will have great hope. As for the Zhongbei and Huaying teams, there are many overlapping selections, which will depend on the official registration.</p>
<p>Women's Group A The Green Team has been established in response to the trend after winning the basketball and field hockey championships. Looking closely at the list, it is indeed ambitious to win the championship. Veterans such as Huang Xingfang and Zhu Shifang have reportedly returned. It can be seen that the team has the ambition to collect all the championships in the competition, which is admirable! However, the teams from the Three Provinces and Huada are also extraordinary. I dare say that this year's women's performance may have a slight improvement. I hope that the teams will train hard and discover new talents, which would be fortunate! The seven members of Ke Bulinji, Que Libotuo, Sasha Kejin, Yelong, and Ao Chailiao have left the team.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Xiqing Tactics <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Xiqing continues to use its usual style, using man-to-man marking, relying on its height, strength, and agility, which gives them a considerable advantage. Every shot must wait for the tall Founick to guard the enemy's basket before the ball is passed. Then, in case of a miss, Founick can catch it and shoot again. At the same time, Que Libotuo and others take the opportunity to advance and prepare to fight for the rebound, making it difficult for the opponent to take it away.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Commentary on the Final Match Between Zhongqing and Xiqing in the Charity Basketball Game for This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The basketball teams of the Chinese Youth Association and the Western Overseas Chinese Youth Association held a charity basketball game to raise funds for this newspaper's scholarship fund. It was held last Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the gymnasium of the Ruixian Bridge Youth Association, using a best-of-three system. In the first two games, each side won one game, and the battle situation has been recorded in the previous issue of this publication. The 16th was the final battle to determine the winner, and both sides were unwilling to give in because of their reputation. The audience also believed that Zhongqing's defeat in the second game (Zhongqing won the first game 23-18, and Xiqing won the second game 29-11) was too miserable and that they must avenge their shame. Knowing that there would be a fierce battle, the venue was extremely crowded that night.</p>
<p>Both Squads</p>
<p>Zhongqing made improper adjustments in the second game, resulting in a disastrous defeat. For this game, the deployment of troops was particularly cautious. After discussions between team leader Zhang Huixiang and captain Yu Hongzi, it was decided to select the five main generals from Hualian: Fan Qinggong, Xi Lin, Zhang Xianlun, Wu Chengzhang, and Ma Canxi from Renyu. This lineup was maintained throughout the game, and they finally won. Zhang and others made great contributions. Xiqing still used the seven members of Kaixuan, Miluofu, Founick, Taobolin, Ge Que, Que Libotuo, Sasha Sijin, Yelong, and Ao Chailiao, taking turns to play.</p>
<p>Xiqing Tactics</p>
<p>Xiqing continues to use its usual style, using man-to-man marking, relying on its height, strength, and agility, which gives them a considerable advantage. Every shot must wait for the tall Founick to guard the enemy's basket before the ball is passed. Then, in case of a miss, Founick can catch it and shoot again. At the same time, Que Libotuo and others take the opportunity to advance and prepare to fight for the rebound, making it difficult for the opponent to take it away.</p>
<p>Zhongqing's Offense and Defense</p>
<p>Zhongqing adopted a zone defense that day. When defending, they used a man-to-man style within the zone defense. In the first half, the offensive was slightly dull. After getting the ball, they failed to launch a surprise attack and go straight to the heart of the enemy. Often, after a slight hesitation, the opponent had already deployed a tight defense, making it difficult to penetrate the enemy camp. In the second half, they were much more agile. The defensive method seemed to have been carefully planned. Fan Qinggong used a zigzag pattern to disrupt Xiqing's offensive. Wu Chengzhang always guarded the tall Founick, sometimes blocking him behind the board and sometimes pulling him out of the circle, causing the ball-holder to be afraid to shoot easily, thus slowing down the action. Unfortunately, when Xiqing attacked, Wu Chengzhang pulled Founick away, and his position was too far back, failing to form a quincunx formation. Otherwise, one person could block two enemies, and Fan Qinggong and Zhang Xianlun would not have been so exhausted.</p>
<p>Key to Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>Basketball is originally a sport that requires both intelligence and courage. Looking at this game, Xiqing had plenty of courage and strength, but lacked intelligence. Therefore, their defense and offense, in addition to following the old methods of man-to-man marking and zigzag attacks, had no new tricks. On the other hand, Zhongqing was able to learn from others' strengths and compensate for their weaknesses, and fully demonstrated the unique spirit of basketball, making it difficult to defeat the enemy (the final score was 25-20). The fact that Xiqing had very few ball possessions that day was also one of the reasons for their failure. In the first half, they only had possession for seven minutes, and in the second half, they only had six or seven minutes.</p>
<p>Audience Attitude</p>
<p>During the game, the referee's responsibility is extremely important. However, the audience's attitude is also very important. For example, according to惯例 (custom) , when Zhongqing gets a free throw, the side with more people can use several balls to practice. On this day, there were more than a dozen people in Zhongqing's three teams, and each person only had one chance, resulting in inaccurate throws. Whenever Zhongqing got a free throw, the audience shouted encouragement, which made the thrower feel uneasy and trembling. It is not surprising that only four out of fifteen were successful. Until the end of the game, some people shouted, "Teach them slowly!" "Don't rush!" "It's almost over!" It seemed to lose the demeanor of a civilized country that cherishes etiquette.</p>
<p>Essence of Basketball</p>
<p>I believe that it is necessary to correct the individual skills of basketball players in Shanghai. The organization of basketball emphasizes that individuals can work together and help each other, forming a group of excellent players, which is the essence of basketball. Ma Canxi's strength lies in this, and the score should not be used as the only criterion for evaluation. Therefore, in European and American basketball games, it is not a matter of which team is playing against which team, but of which coach is playing against which coach. While players are responsible for charging and fighting, there is someone else in the command tent who is planning the strategy.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Sports News <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Western Overseas Chinese Youth Association in this city has now been renamed the East Asia Association. Mr. Ke Jiemilov, the person in charge of the association's sports director, the giant Yenuoke, has resigned and is said to be going to work in the sports department of the University of Yue.</p>
<p>Due to water and electricity issues, most swimming pools are now rarely open. The Hongkou Park swimming pool, which usually opens in mid-May every year, is already June and there is still no news. Zhangyuan has become a calcium factory. Although Zhongqing is open, the pool is small and crowded. Other private swimming pools in schools are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Football and basketball are now out of season. In addition to swimming, summer sports include tennis and softball. Unopened tennis balls are worth 20,000 yuan a dozen. It is said that in the near future, domestically produced tennis balls will be available, which is good news for tennis players.</p>
<p>The Softball League is held annually by the Western Overseas Chinese, with students from Yue University and its affiliated high school accounting for the majority of Chinese participants. There are only two women's teams: Yizhong and Kangai. Since last year, the Philippine Yangqin team has held a Group A league at Jiaozhou Park, charging 2,000 yuan per team this summer. It is recently heard that the Shanghai Sports Association authorities want to hold a city-wide softball league in the racecourse. If this can be achieved, then the sport is expected to develop universally, as the racecourse has been the center of stickball and softball activities for many years. (Ke)</p>
<p>In addition to the basketball association, the team, and all related parties, Mr. Zhang Xiangxiang, manager of Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, and Liang Zhao'an and Chen Yilin of the Zhongqing Sports Department, have contributed greatly to the charity basketball game for this newspaper's scholarship fund.
