<h3>徘徊雷伊泰灣內敵運輸船團燃燒日新銳潛艇積極呼應海空作戰</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日空軍對菲島雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，塔克羅班及塔拉克附近之敵橋頭堡，不斷加以猛攻，屢獲莫大戰果，自二十五日夜至二十六晨間，就判明巳行擊沉擊傷或擱淺者言，即達三十五艘之多，其他並有二十九艘被炸起火，且於二十五日之戰鬥中，更有敵航空母艦一艘被擊毀，不能行駛，其艦載機約七十架，均在塔克羅班島及塔拉克橋頭堡降落，是以綜合十九日開始攻擊以來，敵機損失達一百零八架，小艦船徬徨於廣約一百公里之雷伊泰灣內者，在日空軍制壓下，巳呈瀕於潰滅之狀態，刻日機仍出動追擊，採取拼撞載術，毀滅敵艦甚多。又日陸上部隊反覆對塔克羅班及塔拉克之敵軍橋頭堡作猛烈攻擊，逐漸擴大有利之態勢，敵登陸部隊見得後方之接應艦船遭日機猛襲，呈現凄慘景象，其戰意巳喪失殆盡。　　菲律賓基地二十八日中央社電　據日空軍偵察，二十六日上午，雷伊泰灣內之八十艘敵軍運輸船，巳不能向東方逃脫，徒在灣內徘徊，其中二十七艘起火燃燒，烟火之勢，由遠處亦可望見。　　東京二十七日中央社電　此次菲律賓海面發生海戰後，日潛艇即從事活躍，積極呼應日海上部隊及航空部隊作戰，收獲莫大戰果，緣日潛艇會於二十四日指曉，在菲律賓東方海面襲擊敵運輸船團，擊沉其中大型運輸船一艘，繼於是日晚更襲擊敵大運輸船團約二十艘，擊沉十二艘。又於二十五日夜，襲敵航空母艦羣，擊沉其大型航母母艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，合計共達五艘。又當二十四日晚襲擊時，除確認敵艦二艘已被擊沉外，並認有其他敵艦若干艘被擊沉，未經證實，因之各方對日新銳潛艇今後之活躍，期待尤爲殷切。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰戰鬭激烈日軍施準確砲擊</h3>
<p>敵艦載機數十架被燒燬　　馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　雷伊泰島登陸之美軍，企圖逐次向西擴大據點，雷伊泰島附近登陸地點之敵艦上機之邀擊，因日軍確保制空權之敵，亦未能如願以償，加之空母蒙害後，小型機之出現亦漸減少，敵軍急於奪取制空權，由摩羅泰，培里琉後方出動大型之B24型轟炸機，並在塔克羅班附近令艦上機數十架登陸，企圖確保飛機塲，經日軍猛攻，其飛機完全燒燬粉碎，並將塔克羅班，塔拉克兩機塲數處焚燒，以防止敵軍施用。同時，日陸上部隊亦確保雷伊泰之西方高地，施以準確之砲擊，敵軍及艦船亦恐佈日軍夜襲，不敢點燈，雷伊泰灣內之敵艦，爲掩護增強登陸軍，又出動多數運輸船，菲律賓之攻防戰，亦益加激烈。　　馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　雷伊泰灣登陸之美軍，屢遭慘敗，士氣大爲頹喪，大有動搖之概，目下力圖挽回其危險性，仍然不斷向雷伊泰灣增援，且利用惡劣天氣，從事補給工作。他方二十三日以來，停止之艦砲射擊，二十六日復又開始在塔拉克附近登陸之美軍，企圖擴大據點，逐漸向西方侵入，二十五日抵達塔拉克西方聖巴布羅附近，不久將在該處機塲展開爭奪戰　　馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　雷伊泰島登陸之美軍，爲挽回其動員最大限度之基地空軍力，繼續攻擊，一方並企圖以空軍應邀日航空部隊之攻擊，竟冒險將艦載機數十架，移防於塔克羅班飛機塲，日軍對該空軍，乃出以先制攻擊，一舉殲滅之。二十六日下午三時十三分，日機開始進攻，對地上之美機數十架，反覆加以機槍射擊，使全機起火焚燒，因此冒最大危險着陸之美機，巳全部喪失，同時，登陸之航空員，整備員，已有被迫暫時離去之模樣。</p>
<h3>美海長廣播暗示敗戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　美國方面對菲律賓近海日美主力艦隊之海空戰，仍以一貫作風，虛僞宣傳，盡量發表日本方面之損失。然此種不能掩飾其弱戰，據華盛頓電，美海長佛列斯托爾二十七日夜廣播，謂美國艦隊於此次海戰，亦遭相當損失，日海軍雖受損失，而勢力依然強大，此點實不能忽視，由斯短短數語，已暗示美國之敗戰矣。　　里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，美海軍當局宣稱：現在美國所有海軍戰艦全部二十艘內，至少有十七隻在太平洋各域。又開戰時於珍珠灣被擊沉之戰艦加利福尼亞號，亦巳修復參加作戰，又二萬七千噸級之超級巡洋艦阿拉斯加及關島兩號，亦被徵用，該艦全長七百五十英尺，裝置十二寸口徑砲九門。</p>
<h3>日閣新顧問名單昨公布</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日政府爲適應決戰階段，除決定設置內閣顧問制外，並會進行銓衡新內閣顧問，茲巳決定以前外相有田八郎等十二人充任之。此次決定由小磯首相呈報天皇陛下批准後，日內閣顧問名單如次：有田八郎，尾野實信，末次信正，豐田貞次郎，結城豐太郎，山下龜三郎，點川養介，安藤廣太郎，小泉信三，正力德太郎，小泉又次郎及吉田後之芳等十二人。</p>
<h3>國府贈予日外交官勳章</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　國府爲褒揚日本駐華外交長官一百零一人功勳起見，特分別贈予同光勳章。</p>
<h3>日陸相激勵生產授三菱工廠獎狀</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，對遊弋台灣東方海面之美五十八機動部隊及菲律賓東方海面之機動部隊，緊握良機連續猛襲，敵美軍遭受敗戰，日軍所獲到大戰果，已如日大本營屢次所發表。按此戰果之獲得，實爲生產陣營努力工作之成績，後方應前綫之需，陸續將精銳轟炸機送往前綫，戰勝之功，當歸於此，於此可證明日本優越無比之科學陣營，已駕凌全世界。擔任生產精銳轟炸機之三菱重工業及其他多數協力工塲，貢獻作戰全局實大，日陸軍省方面，爲表彰該工塲等，特於二十七日上午九時，假陸軍省內第一會議室舉行授獎式，由陸相衫山元帥對三菱重工業代表常務經理原耕三氏授與獎狀，復激勵集中全力生產等語，代表答詞，暫舉全力，以副所期之決意。</p>
<h3>各地籌備慶祝兩大紀念日</h3>
<p>應與盟邦協力作戰　　南京二十八日中央社電　明日（三十日）爲中日盟約簽訂一週紀念，首都將有盛大慶祝典禮。上午九時，日本駐華谷大使率隨員拜訪中國外交部長及高級官員，申祝賀之意。十時於國民大會堂舉行中日盟約簽訂週年紀念，首都民衆慶祝大會，由各機關公務員學生軍警及民衆等數千人參加，儀式極爲隆重。下午六時，外交部於國際俱樂部招待日本駐華外交使節，舉行宴會，宴後由外宣兩部招待外賓及國府高級官吏，文化界，新聞界人士，舉行春江遺恨影片之試映會，表示慶祝云。　　南京二十八日中央社電　完遂戰爭，建設東亞之中日國交史上劉時代之同盟條約，明（三十）日爲簽訂週年紀念日，下月六日，又爲大東亞共同宣言發表週年紀念。際此盟邦陸海軍捷報頻傳之時，吾人對此兩大紀念日，實益感振奮，倍增自信。吾國各地上下，爲擴大紀念此具有偉大意義之兩大紀念日，積極進行壽備。吾入深知中日同盟條約之簽訂，完全遵照國父遺教所昭示之亞洲各國，應與先進國日本同心協力，根據東方道義精神，以戰勝西方之功利思想。過去百餘年中，英美侵略東亞，無孔不入，東亞各國家各民族，爲自衛自存，起而驅逐英美侵略勢力，乃屬當然之舉。中日同盟條約之簽定，蓋欲以中日兩國之全面協力，作爲安定東亞之中心，從而團結大東亞各國家各民族，一致協力，以打擊英美，肅清其在東亞之侵略勢力。惟保衛東亞完成東亞之建設，必須以全東亞人之總力，互助合作，於同一信念之下，努力挺進，始能圓滿完成。是故建設東亞之最高憲章（在東亞宣言）之發表，實爲大東亞十億民族團結一致，建設東亞，貢獻世界和平之最有力表示。此與中日同盟條約之精神，始終一貫，更爲國父遺忘大亞洲主義之全體表現。溯自中日簽訂盟約一年以來兩國關係即已根據條約精神，益形緊密，協力體制，愈見增強。深信以中日兩國之協力爲中心，必能團結東亞，共同努力於東亞共榮之建設。在過去一年中，吾國上下，正竭盡所能，以期貢獻於國家，貢獻於東亞。如在物質上，節約一切非必要之消耗，停止一切不必要之享受，以充裕戰力協力戰爭在精神上，則對大東亞戰爭之眞諦，認識益深，信念益增。惟吾人有不能巳於言者，即爲渝方之執迷不悟，尚欲拖延戰爭，甘爲英美利用，坐招東亞叛徒之惡名。吾人當此東亞史上兩大紀念日之來臨，甚願渝方有識人士深自反省，早日停止抗戰，驅逐英美勢力，俾多保留國家民族之一份元氣以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。總之，在此中國興廢，與東亞存亡之最後關頭，吾全國人民，及全東亞十億民族，必須以同仇敵愾之心，齊一步驟，爲維護本國之生存，爲爭取東亞之解放而奮鬥，亦惟如此，新世界之建設，方能開始，全人類之幸福，始可祈致。</p>
<h3>對日軍燦爛戰果德深表敬意</h3>
<p>郭培爾昨晚廣播演講　　柏林二十八日中央社電　德宣傳部長郭培爾於星期五晚廣播，申述其對盟邦日本及武裝兵士所獲之燦爛戰果，深表敬意。日軍於台灣菲律賓海面之海空戰中，予美國艦隊以痛烈致命之打擊，使敵感受深刻之不安，日本國民更於此役，復將美國主義霸佔太平洋之野心掃除淨盡，又將日本固有之歷史傳統性全部表揚。德國國民值茲決定日德兩國生死存亡及將來幸福之秋，唯有與日本國民相互提携，駢肩作戰，始可獲完全之勝利。日本之捷報傳入德國後，德國舉國歡騰，吾人能與果敢無比之日本國民立於同一戰綫，不勝光榮。　　戰局對德利害參半郭工繼稱，在過去三個月中，會發生對戰局作根本變更之重要事件，其中對德利害參半，敵人所抱之希望仍未達到，德人並不因敵之總攻勢及政治煽動者之活動而告崩潰。進入德國之路仍行封閉，東西南三線雖仍處於非常緊張之情勢下，但有理由相信其即將趨於穩定。　　爭取生存決不屈膝戰爭雖時或陷於艱苦之境，但德國民族如不獲得獨立及生存權利之保障，決不中止作戰。敵人基於戰事之發展，以求迫使德人屈膝，但除敵方人力及物力之損失外，且其因內部政治之原因，亦不能使戰事延至無定之期限也，故敵人亦已發覺需要儘可能迅速結束戰事，且損失將日趨重大也，在於時間之競賽中，德人實有勝利之機會，倘德人降敵，則此世界將成德人之地獄矣。　　東西國境防禦堅強旋郭氏論及軍事局勢稱，德人已放棄自一九四○年以來所佔領土地之大部份，此乃爲德人焦慮之原因，但德人已在一九三九年之戰綫上，建立鞏固之防綫矣。自安亨一役後，敵人巳不復提及開進柏林之語。東綫蘇軍在各段發動攻勢，欲求於冬季前獲得決定，但蘇軍之人力資源，決非用之無竭者也，故吾人可信終能克服自東來之危險。巴爾幹之整批背叛，遂迫使德人撤退，但幸洪牙利於最後一分鐘，竟能回返於德方。　　不恤犧牲求達勝利德人現在所最當注意者，乃爲恐怖空襲，但德國新型飛機將予敵人以有效之抵抗，德國於不斷空襲之下，仍能增加軍火生產，且能製造新型武器，加以技術之改進，此可視爲預期根本改變戰局之有力因素之加強也。德人決不使其祖國成爲地獄，亦決不令其婦孺滅絕而其工人被流逐至西伯里亞也。而摩根韜之徒所規定德人生活之規則，絕無實現之日，其所予敵人瘋狂計劃之唯一答覆者，乃不惜任何代價，以獲得最後勝利是也。</p>
<h3>威爾遜中將抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　德國社訊：反軸心軍地中海區總司令威爾遜中將，頃偕愛多華特少將曁艦長一人抵莫斯科，渠等此行，聞與談判保加利亞停戰條件有關。</p>
<h3>桂南日軍佔領江口墟</h3>
<p>日機轟炸成都郊外　　華南前綫日軍基地二十八日中央社電　桂南日軍自擊潰渝第九十五師，佔領宣村後，繼續進攻，於二十五日黎明，突轉向西南，踏破泥濘道路，迫近渝第百三十五師，廣西軍第四十六軍所屬根據地江口墟，排除渝軍頑強抵抗，予以猛攻，於二十六日傍晚將該地完全佔領。按江口墟位於桂平東北方約四十公里，乃平南平原西方之關口，爲通達南寗柳州之渝軍一大要衝。　　里斯本二十八日中央社電　據重慶來電，日航空部隊廿六日夜間，前後三次轟炸成都郊外，重慶發出警報達五小時之久</p>
<h3>爭奪安特衛普激戰進行中</h3>
<p>貝維蘭半島加軍登陸　　里斯本二十八日中央社電　西綫戰事仍以荷蘭地區爲中心，安特衛普一帶之攻防戰刻正展開據德方公報，德軍刻正對安特衛普後方哥地維爾塞稜島南岸登陸之反軸心軍猛攻中，並將些耳德方面敵軍之進攻企圖，完全阻止。赫陀根波什（Hertogenbosch）附近昨日再度展開悲壯之巷戰。　　柏林二十八日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍事發言人指陳，加拿大軍隊，在華爾契倫（Walchercn）及貝維蘭三處登陸，但兩處咸被擊退，祇有一處成立橋頭堡。敵軍初次使用水陸兩用之坦克車，被德軍擊毀多輛。</p>
<h3>蘇軍進駐土保邊境</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：土保國境之保加利亞守軍，須全部與蘇軍交替。　　柏林二十八日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍事發言人稱，巴爾幹德軍作戰之目標，爲保守由南而北大路之開放，在斯柯爾普傑（Skolpje）及克拉爾傑伏(Kraljevo），德軍已擊退途中之障礙，預料蘇軍將盡其所能，再將各主要路綫封鎖，但德軍已採取反措施。　　芬挪兩港德軍撤退　　柏林二十八日中央社電　德元首行營二十七日發表：德軍已自芬蘭北部之貝阿莫及挪威北部之基爾開納斯撤退。星期評論</p>

<p>近來嚴重的物價問題，實際上乃是供需失調問題，因爲物價不過是供需關係的表現。　　近來當局抑平物價的方法有二：一是規定限價；但事實上限價等於具文，且在不時提高，有時新限價甚至高於市價者！二是收縮通貨；惟首受其影響者僅爲證劵的貶值，物價即暫平，但往往不久又復騰漲，結果倒是通貨跟着物價膨脹，於是轉復引起物價的續騰。　　這種事實，表示物價問題不能僅從物價本身或通貨關係上謀解決。在經濟學上有一基本原理，即供過於求則價跌，求過於供則價漲。所以，物價問題須從供求關係上謀解決。　　在戰時，因軍需增加，物資短少，加以奸商囤積，供需關係巳無法自然調節，因此有實行統制的必要，其目的蓋在：一加強勞役與重點生產：即增加工作的時間和強度，停止非必需品的製造，強調急需物資的增產。二調節運輸：因軍運頻繁，交通工具不敷，故限制不必要的轉運，而集中於急需品的輸送。三節約消費：例如限制娛樂，禁止造酒等，以使需求減少。四平均分配：例如實行配給，以戢囤積，以平享受，藉謀安定社會。凡此均非資本主義的方法所能辦到，因此須採計劃性的，強制性的統制經濟政策。　　至於我國，爲了產業落後，必須迎頭趕上，所以不但在戰時，即在平時也需要統制。因爲：一在資本主義下生產與分配之無政府狀態的弊害，早巳暴露，我國的民族資本主義尚未發達，不必蹈此覆轍。二在放任主義下，中國決不能與先進的資本主義國家自由競爭，因此不能不實行整個的經濟計劃，以謀發展產業。　　不過，我國自實行統制政策以來，經濟景況反有每況愈下之勢，則其原因很多，如：人事不健全，職權不統一，收買限價太低，採辦方式不當，配給脫期且不足量等是。此外，還有一個根本的原因，即統制的不澈底。這可從四方面說：一不周密：只重消費過程的採辦與配給而忽視了增產的實踐。二不普遍：一部份物品因未受統制而價格日漲，終至影響於統制品生產的減少與黑市的漲價。三買辦性：採辦與配給都委託商人，而商人於採辦時復與貪污土劣勾結以盤剝生產者，於配給時將配貨售諸黑市而致有無貨配給之事。四無力量：對治安不能確保，對資金不能調用，對交通不能指揮，且政令不能行諸全國，計劃不能澈底實現。　　欲改善今後的統制，則統制機構必須具有政治道德，政治才幹和政治力量，方能爲國家民衆謀福利，制定整個的計劃，而作強制的執行。這不是商人自治團體所能勝任的，最好是在政府中設一賢明有力的綜合的統制機構。這一機構須能直接指揮財政、金融、生產、收買、轉運和分配，並得直接管理一切私人的企業，才能澈底實行整個的經濟計劃。　　例如以米糧問題而論，欲抑平米價，同時必抑平其他物價，方不致使農民因受損失而棄農；故須作綜合的統制。其次，爲充裕成本和改良耕法。以使農民力能增產，則須予以物質上的補助（如低利貨款，施借種籽，租予耕具，發給獎金等），並授以科學化的指導：這便需要金融、實業及農藝專家等各方面的合作。第三，米榖收穫後應直接收買以節省中間剝削，大規模的轉運以節省運輸成本，這便需要能夠動用大量資金和指揮交通工具。第四，收買量有了相當正確的估計，配給量也便能有相當正確的規定，倘有不足，盡可搭配雜糧，使民生得獲安定，黑市無從猖獗；因此，對於收買、轉運和配給，須作統一的管理。　　對於其他物資問題的解決辦法也是同樣的。所以，綜合計劃和執行的強有力的統制經濟機構有成立的必要。　　這一機構，姑假定名稱爲[全國經濟委員會]（現在的[全經會]形同虛設，不足負此重任），設專任的常務委員，並任財政、實業、建設三部長爲兼任委員。在各省市設經濟局，在各縣區設經濟科，在各鄉鎭設合作社。該會須能直接指揮財政，實業、建設三部、及經濟局、科與合作社。私人的工廠、公司和交通機關等的營業方針亦須受該會的指揮，但仍容計其取得合理的利潤。　　該會內部除設常務委員外，其下設：總務處，辦理會內事務與對外交涉等；企劃處，辦理調查，研完與設計全國經濟計劃等；調節處，辦理增產指導，企業的調整，生產資金與工具的調劑等；採辦處，辦理收買和轉運等；貯配處，辦理貯藏與配給等；督察處，辦理經濟保安，取締黑市，懲辦囤積等。經濟局，科和合作社，各視其需要而辦理綜合的工作。至於其他一切經濟機關，則可全部裁撤。茲將系統列如後表：國民政府行政院全國經濟委員會常務委員會——財政部實業部建設部總務處企劃處調節處採辦處貯配處督察處省市經濟局縣區經濟科鄉鎭合作社　　該會中除財政，實業與建設三部仍得分署辦公外，常務委員會與所屬各處，均須合署辦公，俾便經常聯絡，以收綜合統制之效。至於會址，則以設於全國經濟中心之上海爲最宜。　　中國經濟的痼疾已深，頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚固不能奏效，襲用資本主義的方法更不足補救。如欲改善，則務須對全國的經濟，作有計劃，強有力的統制，使生產確能增加，採辦確屬有效，配給眞正合理，再加以限制消費，根絕囤積，從而強制調劑供需的關係。但這種工作，決非僅善鑽營或吃豆腐的人所能辦得好的；這種工作須有一賢明有力的綜合統制機關，而負責者且須有公共道德，專門才知，和強大的職權才行。　　爲謀戰時經濟的強化和戰後經濟的復興，僅作建議如上，尚請全國人士，爲改善國計民生，羣起討論而推進之！</p>

<p>慶祝菲島海戰勝利特刊</p>
<h3>完成保衛大東亞使命日海軍樹立偉大戰果敵美兩年來的反攻企圖歸於粉碎</h3>
<p>— （志新）</p>
<p>自從十月十二日以來，台灣洋面，菲島東方海面及菲島雷伊泰灣內海空戰的戰果，據日本大本營的正確發表，在這十五日間巳擊沉擊毀美國艦艇一百五十四艘以上，長二百公尺以上，可載飛機近百架的大型航空母艦，以及乘人一千五百名以上，備有巨砲十門的戰艦，亦有多艘沈沒。日本對於敵美二年來的反攻，屢次聲稱，如果迫近來一定予以決定的一擊，這句話並非空頭支票，果眞是如此做到了。敵美也知道迫近日本的話，準會受到損害，不過爲了早日結束戰爭的焦慮，以及羅斯福指望四選當選的野心，遂使他們強行這種無理性的作戰。日本艦隊抓住了良機，奮然蹶起，敵美艦隊於是吃不消了。日本的砲手，在[一發必中之砲勝於百發一中之砲百門]的精神下，猛烈訓練，所以不中的砲彈簡直是沒有的，而且所用的炸藥其威力又爲世界第一，因此美艦一和日艦會，不久即相繼沈沒。</p>
<h3>敵美士兵損失浩大</h3>
<p>美國的物資的確是多的，然而質地並不高出品敵對。由於艦艇被擊沈擊毀及起火的有一百五十二艘之多，其士兵的死傷當達十萬名。海軍人員的工作，非常困難，要養成一個合格的人員，至少須三年以上。而今日呢，他們三年以上的熟練者是一下子沈在海底了。　　美國人口據說有一億三千萬，其中有五千二百萬並非盎格魯撒克遜系的，換言之，即其父母是外國人，所以眞的美國人不過七千八百萬。這次人的損失之大，從美國人來說，一定比軍艦的喪失更爲可痛。而且，美國的短期決戰也沒望了。日本海軍已光榮地完成了保衛東亞的使命。重慶的人士和我們同樣是東亞民族，聽到了日軍的這種戰果，正如　國父孫先生所說日本海海戰戰勝時東亞的人士也爲之大喜一樣，表面上已經美國化的重慶人士，胸內一定也會感到興奮的。</p>
<h3>日軍發揮忍耐戰力</h3>
<p>建立勝利的階梯　　歷史是循環的，一八九八年大破西班牙艦隊於馬尼刺灣而佔領菲島奠下基礎的美國海軍，在四十六年後的今日，於雷伊泰灣內外的決戰中，却從日本艦隊蒙受瀕於潰滅的打擊，再逢到被逐出菲律賓而敗竄的厄運。然而若視這個所謂匪島洋面海本戰身爲一獨立的戰鬥，未免有些危險，其實我們應該記住，這不過是去年十一月下旬在吉爾伯特羣島一戰開始的約經一年的太平洋戰爭的一環，即在這一年間，吉爾伯特，馬紹爾，馬里亞納，亞特密拉爾，新幾內亞各地的歷次戰鬥，是互相有關互相影響的，其間有着種種因果關係，所以這次在菲島洋面海戰中的勝利，決不是和以前的其他戰鬥沒有關係的。爲了造成菲島洋面的勝利，日本在吉爾伯特的將士是全部殉國了，以後塞班，大宮島，迭尼安的守軍也相繼玉碎。成爲這次決定性勝利的基石的尊貴犧牲，其偉大或許有人不甚明瞭。不過，這一切的犧牲，終於成爲獲得勝利的階梯，今日已歷歷顯於我們的眼前了。</p>
<h3>聯合艦隊臥薪嘗胆</h3>
<p>自從吉爾伯特羣島大戰以來，迄今約及一年，想起來眞是長期的戰鬥。在這長長的一年中，日本聯合艦隊臥薪嘗胆地忍耐着。尤其是塞班島一戰，想到當時的危急，我們至今猶覺心悸。那時，許多有識者也高喊日本本土已　危殆，力主聯合艦隊出而討伐美國海軍。但是，聯合艦隊就是在這危機急迫之時。也堅忍着。日本聯合艦隊在這一年中何以堅忍不出呢？個中事理，極爲明白。就是日本聯合艦隊要在洋心大破敵美艦隊而使之體無完膚，在力量上尚稍有不逮。這個事實，聯合艦隊本身比誰都明白。因此，力誘敵美艦隊進入有利日方的戰塲，即誘其駛入日方基地航空兵力的勢力圈，使敵軍補給綫延到最長，另一方面則將自己的補給綫縮到最短，於是兩軍的綜合戰力得到充分的均衡，便可一舉而起，與敵決戰了。這個決心，在這一年中是穩固不動的。敵軍當亦了解日軍的這種基本戰略，所以他們在展開於太平洋上的戰鬥中，以極爲愼重的態度，防備日本聯合艦隊的出擊。但在這次菲島洋面海戰中終於出現的日本聯合艦隊，却仍使他們吃到決定的敗北，其原因便是在眞正的艦隊對艦隊的近接戰鬥中，美國海軍到底不是精強的日本海軍的敵手。　　總之，於茲一年的太平洋戰爭，現已越過了決戰的最高峯。自珍珠灣一役以至菲島海戰，以足足一年有餘的時間而好容易在渺茫的太平洋上推進的敵美，却在一陣狂風下瞬即傾覆了。其狀之慘。實不亞於拿破侖的遠征莫斯科。在這決戰中，最可感的就是日本是耐力很好地戰勝的。即在這一年間，如果缺乏依照基本戰略而行的耐力，那末勝利的榮冠今日決不會戴在日本頭上的。[耐力之戰]的重要性，現在已由事實來說明了。有了這一次的絕對勝利以後，我們決不稍懈，更要本着[戰爭從今日始]的決心，強韌地向前邁進，直到取得最後勝利之日爲止。</p>
<h3>菲島海戰致勝因素三種優秀力量</h3>
<p>日本在滬海軍專家分析　　這次台灣及菲島東方海戰，敵美艦隊業已擊潰，盟邦日本海軍獲致空前大捷。頃承在滬日本海軍事家發表談話如次：　　[台灣與菲律賓海面的戰爭，至二十六日止大致巳告一段落了，今後不過掃蕩殘餘而已。這次戰役中敵美艦隊已經大部潰滅，今後敵美如果再圖蠢動，倒是一個很有趣的問題。我們雖勝不驕，仍需要充分準備。我們這次大捷的因素有三點：　　第一，戰術的優秀，也就是艦隊運用法的優秀，司令長官及作戰參謀的優秀。菲律賓有大小島嶼八十餘個，我們就利用這些島嶼，一方面引誘敵美艦隊深進雷伊泰灣，以便聚殲，所以這次敵艦隊進入雷伊泰灣，隔了七天以後，我們才加以一鼓而聚殲。敵方完全不知利用地形，我們的艦隊一經出動，不過三十六小時內，已將敵艦隊大部殲滅，所以，日本這種優秀戰術，決非羅斯福及佛列斯托爾所能領悟。其次，我們的艦隊能在極狹的海峽中自由行駛，敵美呆笨的參謀，絕對不會發揮此種戰法的。　　第二，科學的優秀，美國向以精巧機械誇耀於世，可是，在這次戰役中，日本艦隊射發第一砲時，不過兩分鐘敵方的最大巡洋艦就擊沉了，這就表示日本大砲機械的優秀，炸藥的優秀，從此更可見日本砲隊隨時可以擊沉美艦，爲敵方砲隊或水雷等所不及。敵美軍艦的防禦力量向稱世界上最優秀的，可是，在一霎那間即被擊沉了。　　第三，軍士技術的優秀。日本軍士在素田方面非常優秀的，因爲都經過多年的猛訓練，自與訓練僅數月的美軍，無論在素質方面，戰鬥技術方面，絕對不問的。　　總之，日本與敵美艦隊海戰，猶之勇士與流氓相搏。我軍闖入，敵即四散潰逃。這次戰役中敵旗艦會發電求援，求援電報絕對應用密碼，但敵軍因措手不及，倉皇慌張，遂用明碼拍發，發至美國時，同時亦通至日本及全世界，這種狼狽情形，無異明白告訴世人：[美國艦隊是瀕於危殆了]。</p>
<h3>擊滅驕敵戰力努力飛機增產</h3>
<p>— 李鈞</p>
<p>建立戰果，須加緊增產，傳來噩耗；更矢誓增產。舉國家總力從事的飛機生產，是經何路而成爲擊滅驕敵英美之戰力的呢？茲略述其體系，藉以闡明必需大量物資的緣由。　　敵美於剛開戰後，即揭出[莫忘珍珠灣]的摽語，確立飛機增產態勢，最近好容易達到月產一萬架的程序，但這並不能立即飛到我們頭上來。不論任務國家，單有了飛機還不能成立大空軍，必須養成相當於機數的大量航空人員才行。所謂航空人員，不單是飛行員，還需要通信員及偵員。這些航空人員，若不實際乘在飛機上，是無法養成的。　　這就是說，養成一批航空人員，是要從早到晚在天空飛行不息的。聽熟了航空教育隊實況的諸君，一定可以想到那樣在激烈的循環速度下如何消耗飛機本身，以及如何需要多量的燃料。　　輸送部隊　　其次，是所謂輸送部隊，這是空軍的兵站綫。這在以爲空軍尚爲從屬性的人，對於空中輜重的規模等，或許是無從想像的的，然在可說單由空軍來決定勝敗歸趨的今日，在第一綫活動的飛機背後，如何需要多量的後方連絡機，不言自明。在將地球縮小了的航空戰中，其後方依然要賴海陸兩路的運輸，不然的話，飛機便不能當飛機用，正如魚失水鳥飛翼一樣。我們絕對不得忘記航空作戰的距離和速度，而且須在腦中畫出地球的模樣，正視此綫。拿地上部隊來說，爲便第一綫的戰鬥力發揮無遺起見，其兵站綫便需與第一綫同等的兵力。航空作戰中，情形也是如此。就外國的實例而觀，從其擁有與第一綫兵力同樣的空輸師團和後方連絡機等等龐大的航空輜重，也可察知。　　如果戰區廣大，其必要量尤其飛躍增大，敵美在地球外周四萬分里的路綫上從事補給輸送等，決不是輕而易舉的。其野心固然可憎，但是他們的努力，却非予以相當敬意不可，雖然是敵人。隨着戰事的益形激烈，此種部隊的運用也更急切，我們非省悟到彷拂火燒塲一樣喧嘩的嘈雜的混亂狀態。在某種塲合下，第一綫部隊的兵力一度推進，後方補給的任務即更增重。各國對於運輸機的關心，其理由即在於此。蓋這種在後方活躍的部隊，乃是發揮航空戰力的前提條件。　　可是，關於戰斗機，偵察機，轟炸機奮戰的帙事，雖然描繪得有聲有色，而對於輸送部隊的辛勤勞苦，知道的人却很少，結果，世人對於航空的觀感，未免是皮相的，這就是對其微妙的有機的一體性缺乏正確認識的證據。　　研究機關　　其次是研究機關。這也是不容輕視的。從飛機部分的比率而言，或許並不大亦未可知，但各國所必要的研究機關，在這各國技術方面壁櫐森嚴的時代，實在是很龐大的設施，是和其擁有的空軍無關係的絕對量。因此，空軍勢力不大的國家，要分出一部分兵力來作研究，雖然是苦惱的事情，然而在航空技術日新月異的時代中，祇想今日的航空而不見明日的航空，便會立即遭逢慘敗的厄運。敵美的NACA，擁有若干萬的人員，德國的VDM也動員了若干萬名的技術者。尊重技術的呼聲，決不止於增加人員與器材設備。第一先須汲取技術的精神。　　補給部隊　　最後是補給部隊，飛機是由此而運往國內外直接與敵相對的戰鬥部隊（不是指戰鬥機而言）的。而在補給途上有相當大的消耗，也須省悟。敵美從太平洋岸出發，經夏威夷，康頓島，菲濟島而至西南太平洋，綿延八千公里，其補給想須消耗百分之三十，如果環繞地球經非洲，印度而到重慶，那是更不容易了。而且，此種消耗率全受海上各種航空調備的左右，所以一航空氣象，二無綫電連絡，三飛行塲設備等，其重要決不下於第一綫。　　如此而好容易到達前綫部隊的飛機，一面作戰，一面訓練。在不斷的出動中，加上實際戰鬥以外的猛烈訓練，飛機是漸漸耗損了。正如一塊冰，雖然放着不用，也會慢慢溶化的。縱然沒有劇烈的戰鬥，飛機也會耗損的。　　盡可能減低其耗損率的，便是修理部隊及其本隊的修理能力。受到重大損壞的，則委諸前者之手，簡單的破損則由本隊自行修整。可是，由於所在地方的便利與否，以及修理工具，零件，材料等關係，有時祇好將稍有損壞的貴重飛機棄置一旁。　　因此，各部隊所有的飛機，是不能夠全體同時飛出的，左右不過可以出動其若干成而巳，而且這是需要將空中勤務者的人數巧妙安排好之後才能出動的，有的時候，飛機是排好了，可是却飛乘員，或者人巳分配好了而飛機尚在整備中，所以實際出動的飛機並不多。敵美的航空人員是分三班交替的，可以充分休養，與此相抗的辦法，便是改良　裝關係的設計以減輕乘員的負擔，以及認眞講求關於其疲勞的航空醫學上的對策。　　如此看來，實際　在第一綫活躍的飛機，可知不過是從工廠出來的總數中的百分之幾而巳。我們應該用十倍於今的努力，將飛機一架架送上前綫去，同時更應研究如何使這金字塔型的部分有效。因此，迄今尚未加以討論的許多問題，以及許多世人未會注意的勞苦辛勤，不久將可提出來當作眞的問題。當我們將航空界的矛盾和不自然除去時，深信航空戰力的定會突飛猛晉的。</p>
<h3>各地祝捷</h3>
<p>蒙疆各地慶祝大捷　　北平二十九日中央社電　自日軍在台灣東方海面，將敵機動部隊殲滅打擊，蒙疆興亞協會，爲表示慶祝，並昂揚官民之決戰意旨起見，特令飭各地興亞協會分支部，於二十四日一致展開慶祝大會。　　青島二十八日中央社電　青島中日各團體，爲響應日軍於台灣及菲島海面所獲之大戰果，頃定於本月三十日至十一月六日，爲感奮滅敵突擊週，大東亞共同宣言發表紀念會，亦於此時舉行。　　新民會通過感謝案　　北平二十八日中央社電　華北新民會本年度全聯會，業於二十六日舉行，二十七日全塲一致通過感謝日軍英勇作戰案，由王副議長陳新民會宣傳局長等十餘人，代表全聯會，訪日華北軍及北平海軍武官府，贈呈感謝狀。同時並表明全聯會出席代表決完成華北所負重任。</p>
<h3>菲總統闡明恊力決意</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　日軍此次獲大戰果，使菲律賓人民之戰意愈趨昂揚。二十七日晨洛勒爾大總統特闡明菲人滅敵之決意如次：日軍之大戰果愈增進，則我菲國人民對共和國得以保全之信念愈堅，吾人必須深切認識惟有日本方爲我國領土之保護者，故對日軍之敢門，衷心表示感謝。同時更當以此大勝利爲機，增強協力，以期能早日完成大東亞戰爭之勝利。蓋日本之勝利，即菲律賓之勝利，當確信日本與菲國有不可分離之共同關係。吾人誓於決戰之今日，向我等正義之前途猛進，爲最後之勝利奮鬥。　　美國方面情形嚴重　　蘇黎世二十八日中央社電　美軍於雷伊泰島登陸後，遭猛烈反攻，於菲律賓羣島東方展開海空戰，瑞士國民關於日大本營所發表，及東亞戰局，極爲關懷。據同盟社訊，日航空部隊除於雷伊泰灣攻擊美艦船外，并於其他水域大事活躍，美國方面亦廣播菲律賓海空戰，有決戰性格，調此次戰爭乃決定太平洋作戰歸趨之役，美國民均極重視戰局。此次日軍於台灣海面首將其機動部隊殲滅大半，故今後美艦隊恐難掩護麥克活塞之作戰。</p>
<h3>台菲海面日軍大捷奠定戰爭必勝基礎</h3>
<p>谷大使周代院長發表談話　　谷大使　　南京二十八日中央社電　盟邦陸海空軍前於台灣東方海面，及菲律賓雷伊泰灣，予敵機動部隊重創，收獲莫大戰果。日駐華大使谷正之氏，特就此發表談話稱，日陸海空軍精銳部隊，對進攻台灣東方海面之敵美機動部隊，予以殲滅打擊後，未出甸日，又邀擊進攻菲島東方海面，及雷伊泰灣方面之敵機動部隊，將其重創，收獲戰爭罕有之偉大戰果。我一億同胞，對於作戰前途必勝之信念益堅定。回顧日軍將士，自去年以來，即負起今日之必勝信念與重任，本人衷心表示謝意，同時對於前綫殉國將士，就裘同胞，其已完成奠定建設大東亞之基石，本人對此深致敬意。尤對吾後方一億國民，尤其在華居留民諸君，深能體會政府之方針，埋頭苦幹，各傾全力，努力本位工和，以確立決戰體制下之諸般態勢，亦深表欣慰。余確信日本臣民，其盡忠報國之誠，實爲產生日本必勝信念之根源，故此次大勝，更應慶祝。同時日本國民之眞誠恊力戰爭，今後將更能發揮偉大力量。然敵英美爲掩飾此次敗績，今後將企圖以種種謀略，　虛構宣傳，惑亂人心。同時必仍放棄其制霸東亞野心，但吾民已具有必勝不敗信念，可摧毀彼等之企圖，已不待言。余希望居留民諸君，絕對信任日本必勝之國防態勢，遵從當局之方針，忍受一切困苦，增強生產，努力奉公，以貫徹日本固有之傳統精神。並深望諸君，居留中國領土內之盟邦國民，時時不忘身爲實踐對華新政策之地位，體會中日同盟條約之精義，及大東亞共同宣言之本旨，必以誠待人，以道義處事，與中國官民更緊密協力，以努力完遂大東亞戰爭，及建設大東亞偉業。　　周院長　　南京二十八日中央社電二此次盟邦海軍在菲島東方海面擊潰敵美海軍，獲得赫赫戰果，即大東亞戰爭奠定必勝之基礎，我大東亞十億民族共同協力之解放戰爭之前途，愈趨明朗。是故我全國上下對此次盟邦海軍之勝利，莫不熱烈慶賀，國府行政院周代院長，亦特於昨（二十八）日爲此發表談話如次：　　此次盟邦海軍在菲島東方海面猛擊敵軍，獲得偉大戰果，不僅使敵軍之反攻企圖遭遇一大頓挫，且亦顯示日軍實力之堅強，及在菲島方面防衛之鞏固。溯自敵美企圖反攻以來，基聲勢雖似已逐向西伸展，惟究其實際，則僅在太平洋上獲得一二孤島，於整個戰局之推移，絕無決定之影響。再就美軍之空襲台灣，及在雷伊泰島登陸而言，其爲孤軍深入，亦顯而易見。反之，日軍則以逸待軍，可隨時出擊，圍殲敵軍，是故敵美軍之連遭重創，乃屬當然。惟吾入於此應一掃盲目崇拜英美，相信物質萬能之錯誤思想，對盟邦作戰實力，重加體認，堅持必勝信念。見勝不驕，雖敗不跌，蓋今日之世界整個戰局，其勝敗之決定，決不在於一時之得失，必須以堅強之決意，不屈之精神，集中總力，則最後勝利，必屬於我。吾人以盟邦地位，除對此次日軍在菲東海面之大捷，深感快慰，並對前綫將士表示敬意外，益當傾舉全力，擔負積極增強戰力之責任也。</p>
<h3>菲海面及雷伊泰島灣三日海戰詳情</h3>
<p>栗原報道部長對外記者說明　　東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營海軍報道部長栗原悅藏大佐，二十七日會見外國記者團時，就二十四，五，六三日間菲律賓海面及雷伊泰灣海戰詳情說明如次：日海軍巳於台灣海面擊毀尼米　之右腕，今復於菲律賓海面將其左腕之金格德艦隊予以澈底痛擊。此次海戰之特點，第一即二十五日晨之藏馬島東方海上決戰空母四艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一艘之大戰果，而日方毫無損害。其次爲敵二十五日指曉之攻擊雷伊泰灣，此實爲大胆之冒險戰法，此除予敵以極大打擊外，已如大本營所發表，日方亦有若干損失。栗原大佐復就藏馬島東方海戰事，指出敵方拍發援救電報之事實稱，敵方所拍電報之內容，第一　[七時二十分，日軍來擊，有力之日軍二隊，刻仍攻擊中]，第二爲[日艦隊對我攻擊中，請火速救援，速以高速空母攻擊]，如此重要作戰電報，而以明碼拍出，其狼狽情形，實較珍珠灣時尤甚。大佐並言，予敵方之損失，爲擊沉二十一萬噸（雷伊泰灣之戰果亦在此內），擊毀三十七萬噸（雷伊泰灣之戰果不在此內），擊沉擊毀共爲六十八萬噸，計算其人之損害，則爲一萬四千三百名左右。繼之記者團會質問謂[此似乎過少]，大佐則答稱，日海軍目的非僅在殺滅敵軍，此計算僅爲過少之估計而已，爲事實者，並未算入雷伊泰灣內及運輸船之數字。此外，擊落敵機之航空員等。當然不在此內，故實際上敵軍損失恐達四萬名左右。栗原部長並言及艦載航空部隊與基地航空部隊之關係，指出美海軍主張之[航空母艦優勢之原則]，已爲事實所毀壞，大佐謂，軍艦與要塞之戰爭，要塞常勝者，已有歷史所證明，現代戰無論由海上陸上，雖以飛機代替砲彈，然其時陸上基地飛出之飛機，若較之艦載機則極爲有力航程，行動及破壞力，轟炸力亦大，又作爲基地之陸地基地，與航空母艦，此亦以陸地基地爲有力，是以敵軍由海上以航空艦等攻擊擁有完備之大要塞，大航空基地之日本本土台灣，菲律賓等地者，實爲魯莽之策，此次敵方喪失多數航空母艦，乃屬當然，敵方今後必更大量建造航空母艦，然日軍必可使之全部葬於海底。後栗原大佐更指出以下極堪注目之事實，即日陸軍機無論於台灣及於印度洋方面，皆隨處實行海上攻擊。</p>

<p>中國方面艦隊報道部長松島大佐對美廣播，題爲[菲島東方海面的日美決戰]。菲島海面大戰果發表的二十七日，恰值敵美的海軍紀念日，松島大佐備致揶揄，其廣播詞大要如次：　　全世界注目的一瞬間　　本日是美國的海軍紀念日。當這光榮的日子，我能夠遠隔重洋，向美國海軍長官佛列斯托爾並海軍將士致詞，眞是無上光榮。第一，我謹先報告現在尚在進行中的菲島東方的日美海上決戰，美大平洋艦隊遭逢了幾大半被擊滅的悲運。以美國的偉大的海軍建設者齊奧陀。羅斯福氏的誕生日定爲海軍紀念的今天，由於雷伊泰灣的慘敗，近代美國海軍到了它的末日，那是很不幸的。浪費了貴重的物量，有着光榮的建設的歷史，而保持着誇耀於全世界的地位的美海軍，竟然會有這樣慘淡結束的一天，那是出於任何人的意料之外，我們可以想像，全世界的耳目，正注視着這歷史的一瞬間。然而美國宣傳的魔術，廣播極荒謬的宣傳。據二十七日的華盛頓路透社電：[美國太平洋艦隊，在過去三天的菲島海空戰中，擊滅日本艦隊，擊沉軍艦二十六艘以上，主要的是空母與戰艦。]另外又說：[報道尚不甚完全，戰鬭似尚在繼續中，這是明白的。]而其所發表的美國的損失則極少。這證明他們的報道極不正確。我們應該注意，美國所發表的戰果中，數字大不相同。本海戰中美海軍的空母，戰艦等被我艦隊迫擊，發出明碼電報向友軍求助，美國所有的通信機關，大概都很清楚地收到的吧！當此光榮的海軍紀念日，在美國所稱的勝仗中自然不會有此悲號。關於絞盡心血而建設起來的本國艦隊的戰鬬結果，美國民衆竟完全不知其眞相，誠屬可慶可賀。　　歷史的海戰在菲島東方海面告一段落，敵的敗殘部隊似乎向東南方海面逃避的模樣。於是雷伊泰島登陸的敵陸上部隊約三師團，完全與其後方隔斷，且我精銳航空部隊，毫不假借地對雷伊泰灣逃遁落後的艦艇及運輸艦團，繼續加以猛攻。據二十七日十五時的大本營發表，斷定敵人受到幾乎殲滅的打擊。又漸向菲島一角前進的美軍三師團，與塞班島的情形完全相反，頭上有我空軍猛烈的轟炸掃射，隔於支離滅裂的狀態，誠是敵美軍慘淡的末日。　　本次海戰經過　　現在我想根據所能得到的資料，關於本海戰的經過，作一概略的回憶，蓋此次美軍作戰上的企圖，以麥克沃塞部隊作攻略菲島的基本，而屁米資太平洋艦隊則往海上加以全面的支援。　　敵的兵力部署分南北兩軍，北軍在哈爾塞長官指揮下，以第三艦隊爲主力，南軍在斯布爾安斯指揮下，有第三艦隊的一部，加上第五艦隊，第七艦隊，及澳洲其他的艦艇羣，護衛着幾十艘運輸船團。　　經幾次會談後，據透露的消息，先以北軍對我琉球及台灣的航空基地給與極大的打擊，如其可能，誘出我聯合艦隊，給與致命的打擊，然後從容以南軍迫近菲島，實施登陸戰，這期間，並擬以第二十轟炸隊往大陸在適當時候與以協力。然而這北軍的作戰，在前次台灣空戰中。我艦隊不費多大艦艇的力量，就已受到絕大的損失，而狼狽敗退。而南軍爲了要援救北軍取得合作，正在千方百計企圖妄動中，不期被我航空部隊在菲島東方捉住，而漸趨消滅。但敵的登陸部隊的先鋒，則乘隙侵入雷伊泰灣，十月二十日，終於占得了陸地的一角。可是注視敵人在太平洋的一角蠢動的我聯合艦隊，突然如閃電般出動，這裹，切齒扼腕，翹盼已入的我艦隊將士，以更甚於日本海海戰中前輩所經騐的感動與緊張，踴躍殺敵。這艦隊在廿四日突然現其雄姿，先在菲島東方海面對有力的敵機動部隊自黎明起開始猛烈攻擊，在附近進出的潛水艦與航空部隊協力展開驚天動地的立體海空戰，就在這時候擊沈敵空母四艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦一艘，跟着時間的進行，各地同時發生戰鬥。二十五日晨，在菲島東方海面殲滅敵機動部隊的我艦隊，更以一部從雷伊泰灣南入口突入敵艦艇及運輸船團密集的雷伊泰灣，[斷而行之，鬼神避之]東鄉元帥的遺訓，毫無遺憾地被顯彰着，演出舷舷相摩的海上白刃戰，更對駐於泰可洛班方面的陸上部隊，猛烈砲擊，發揮衝擊戰術的威力，誠爲驚天地，泣鬼神的壯烈奮鬬，而與敵以致命的打擊。二十六日，我航空部隊更對灣內逃遁落後的敵運輸船團及艦艇羣加以猛烈強襲。在麥克沃塞部隊被殲之前，戰鬬將暫繼續下去，如本日所發表的戰果中，敵飛機已大爲減少，現在所剩下的，祇是殲滅陸上的三個師團。以此爲圈套，吸收敵的艦艇於此，發揮各個擊破的妙諦，全擊於今後的作戰。羅斯福總統在海軍紀念日會從白富　海軍軍人播送下面的演詞，但並無一語具體述及此次的海戰。羅斯福說：[海上勢力在決定世界歷史命運途上所占重要的地位，從沒有像今天這樣重要，我海軍受最困難的海戰中砲火的洗禮，但仍表示龐大的力量。太平洋海戰史上重大的一章，尚有待於我人來完成。無疑的，我海軍必能成就。]　　羅斯福總統啊，閣下何故蹯躇不作菲島海戰的數字聲明呢？可聽閣下聲明的美艦隊將士，已大半趟在菲島附近海中飾着珊瑚的光榮的死床上，成爲閣下制霸世界的野心，新政所齊來的殘虐性以及大總統四選的犧牲了，他們將在海底迎接今年的聖誕節，這該如何感激呀！關於這點，在冷靜的感情與人格的責任上，應該三省熟慮。不要吃驚，十二日台灣洋面空戰以來，擊沉擊毀的美國艦艇巳達一百九十三艘之多，其中包含航空母艦三十九艘，戰艦十艘，巡洋艦十九艘，無論怎樣粉飾，美國海軍的這種損失，不久終會眞相暴露的。這中間，人員的損失，如以沉沒作五成擊毀作二成計，亦達五萬八千六百名，塞班島戰役以來的累計，戰死者最少十五萬，死傷合計當不下五十萬之衆。　　一頁悲壯的歷史　　菲島海面海戰，菲島海面海戰！雌伏二年的我聯合艦隊，一度裂眥而起，立即屠戮敵美艨艟百餘艘。噫，何等姜烈，何等悲壯！然而回顧太平洋戰局的往事，又是多長久多痛心的我們隱忍的歷史呵！過去，我守備庫埃茲林，魯奧托的戰士，聲嘶淚涸，在[飛機不夠！飛機，飛機啊！]的喊叫中全體戰死了。過去，我塞班島的同胞，連雲髪高梳的婦女也在孤立無擾的絕島，飲恨萬斛，相抱葬身大海。遠遠聽到這些悲報的我國勇士和同胞，誰不怒髪沖冠？可是，雖然援手亦不可得，我們的悲憤激怒又是如何呢？寒天吃冷水，點點在心頭，他日必報此仇之念，深銘我一億同胞的心版腦海。對於依仗物量而橫行太平洋的敵美艦隊，我聯合艦隊却負起國民如焚的全體意志，決予以透骨的打擊，只待時辰一至，便一刀兩斷，斫斷其傲骨。全軍引頸期待神機到來，而神機終於來臨。櫛風沐雨，積二年的鑽研，強韌達於頂點的我聯合艦隊，一現即迅如疾風，在菲島沿海的一角捉住敵艦隊，一發即如快刀斬亂蔴，斫掉頑固不逞的腦袋，任其噴出攪亂世界的糜爛毒汁。而大本營發表此世界史上永遠不朽的菲島海面面戰的決定性戰果的二十七日，恰爲敵美的海軍紀念日，這眞是天緣巧合！噫嘻，驕者不久！爲解放大東亞民族的神聖戰爭而含苦茹辛奮鬬至今的我們日本民族，雖然物量較少於敵，神明却有慧眼，賜給今日的勝利。這次的勝利，正是軍官民一體的隱忍和努力的血汗換來的勝利。誰醉於此勝利？誰迷於此勝利？我們從此日起，將再臥薪嚐胆，斷然奮鬬，奮鬬到敵美最後屈膝之日！這樣，大東亞民族的宣言行將實現。中國·滿洲國·菲島以至泰國緬甸及印度尼西亞各民族，在這夜色已淡的昧爽之風中，手挽手，不顧血污，在菲島洋面血祭中奮身而起。那個可哀的東洋叛徒重慶，今日也應拋棄一切黑市交易，復歸東亞本位。錯過今日，那就時不再來了。我們一億國民，決不以此決戰戰果自傲，我們要在決定性的勝利下，更向建設大東亞之途踏出新的一步，同時切求東亞十億的同胞，予以更熱烈更積極的協力與合作。雷伊泰灣方面菲島台灣海面日軍綜合戰果</p>

<h3>市經濟局力謀抑平物價檢舉囤積決心戢止人爲漲風</h3>
<p>市經濟局爲報告該局管理物價進行情形，特於昨（二十八）日舉行茶會，招待本市中外各報社記者，並到陳市長代表吳頌臬，經濟保安處處長五島，市宣傳處秘書潘比德，伊地知顧問，首由經濟局長徐天深報告力申當局抑平物價，安定民生之決心。　　徐局長致辭　　[兩星期前，本人對本市物價高漲的總結，會作數次談話，關於治本辦法，本人與中央正在統盤籌劃積極進行中，今天所要報告的，就是現在進行着的抑平物價的緊急措置。本市物價至今，可以說已高至極點，原因固然很多，但其中暴利主義者之囤積操縱，以及任意挹價，實也佔着重要的成分。如倉庫裹的存貨堆積，却不願充分出售，而只想待價而沽。如豬肉牛肉雞鴨蔬菜地貨等等，來源並不缺乏，恐怕比以前還要多，爲什麼貴到這樣呢？顯然是操縱居奇，任意挹價所致。在此大東亞戰爭達到決戰階段的今日，後方民衆惟有節約消費，增加生產，穩定後方物價，鞏固後方經濟，乃是人人所應盡的責任。若任其狂漲不已，不用說影響前方士氣，就是整個國民生計，也要保持不了，所以我們這次經過長期準備與考慮，決定從今天起，發動經濟警察，實行全面大檢查，這次檢查分兩方面進行，一方面調查倉庫堆棧，一方面調查各種生活必需品的非法抬價。關於倉庫堆棧的調查辦法，以及生活必需品的公定價格表，都已在報紙發表，我們調查的對象，不論公私存貨，一律調查，不論中西商號，同時檢舉，務必使物價的漲風，完全戢止，以安民生，　鞏固後方的經濟，這是本局下最大決民的]。　　吳秘書長詞　　[物價問題不能解決，許多的問題都不能解決，物價之高漲，使一般市民生活困難，尤其是薪水階段，因之而不能維持其個人生活。對物價問題之嚴重，市府與經濟局，經濟保安處，曁有關各方，會數度商討解決辦法，經各方研究結果，認爲有二大原因，第一是自然的原因，第二是人爲的原因，前者由於戰時交通困難，運輸不便，以及物資來源之減少，等等所致。後者乃爲奸商暴利主義者，囤積居奇，操縱使然。自然的原因當局自然用種種方法使之消弭，人爲的原因，是上海特殊的原因。若人爲之原因不能去除，則物價問題無法解決，因此經各主管機關，及有關各方數度商討之結果，決定於本月二十七日起，舉行普遍檢查，使企圖非法牟利之奸商，有所制裁，希望將人爲的原因去掉。這雖不是如何見效的辦法，但在當局不得不做。此次經濟檢查開始，希望主管機關能努力辦理，同時深盼輿論界，能多多協助，使上海之物價問題，能順利開始解決。]</p>

<p>太平洋上　　遊弋浩瀚的太平洋上以防敵軍從海空侵擊的特設監祀　，是活躍於防衛日本本土第一線上的觸角。它們都不過是重僅百噸的小艇，在那無邊無際的大洋上，眞是所謂滄海一栗，而它們的武裝也很單薄，每有遇到強敵而奮戰到力竭聲嘶的，艇員的辛苦，實非筆墨口舌所能形容。某日，一隻特設監視艇在距日本東方數百浬的洋上與美國新式大型潛艇相遭遇，血戰三小時以後，終使它受到重傷而遁走。下面便是該監視艇艇長某兵營長所述的洋上血鬥記錄。　　八月的某日，風平浪靜，視界很廣，祇是從早上起便炎熱不堪。八點十分的時候，在左舷四千米的海面，突然浮上一艘大型潛水艇。那是美國最新式的大型潛艇，總在二千噸以上吧。它似乎渺視我們，反而立刻向我們採取攻擊勢態。　　敵艇浮上　　[敵潛水艦浮上，擬加突擊。]打給基地的電報拍出時，同時也下令開足馬力，向潛艇沖鋒。彼我之間的距離，瞬即縮爲三千米。我們抱着先下手爲強的宗旨，馬上將大砲機槍一齊開火。他們大吃一驚，慌忙潛入水底。逃了嗎？我們當然不肯輕易讓它逃走，立即　速駛抵它潛沒的水面附近，施行深水炸彈的攻擊。大約它已沒入海面甚深，我們在水上轟了一陣，不見動靜，於是繼續航行，找尋友艇，以便對付必定還要浮上來的敵方潛艇。　　單調的輪機聲悶悶地響着，時間已是十點十分了，友艇尚未碰到。這時，在右舷一百二十度，距離三千米的地方，美國潛艇又浮起來了，它用全速逃開去。我們當即追踪趕上去，可是速力不及他，距離反而漸來漸遠，相距已在四千米左右。這當兒，敵方突動員十二吋二聯裝砲，八吋砲，二十　二聯裝機砲及七，七糎機槍，猛烈攻擊。於是我們周圍的海面，湧起了一股一股的水柱，泡沫與水花齊飛，宛若陣雨。落在近處的砲彈漸漸增多，我們冒着彈雨，全速疾進，距離減爲三千米，我艇遂一面展張烟幕，一面猛射，繼續突進。距離越縮越短，由二千米減爲一千米。我們準備連人帶艇一齊撞上去，用出最後的力量猛然疾進。這時候，敵艇一看情勢不對，馬上停止攻擊，轉身就逃。他的速力每小時可達二十五浬，比我們快了許多，不久便相距四千米。他們脫出我們的射擊距離以後，立即轉取攻勢。　　這當兒，我艇的砲手和機關槍手等，死傷續出，甲板上塗滿鮮血。突然，一顆敵彈命中了桅桿，一個右腕負了重傷而倒的士兵，看見軍艦旗快要落下來，掙扎着爬起來，在機關槍彈亂飛之下，跑到艦橋上，隻手扶起了軍艦旗。我艇的戰鬥力在惡戰中逐漸衰弱，但是我們的鬥志却反比例地上昇。隔不多久，當我們發出處理機密文件的電報以後，電報機也被破壞，於是我們與基地失去了連絡的工具。因爲速力不夠。要想撞上去同歸於盡，事實上有點不可能，所以祇好咬緊牙齒，盡力予敵艇以打擊。不幸得很，我艇的槍砲又相繼被損。狂妄的他們竟將我們當玩物一般作弄起來，我們雖然氣憤，可也奈何他們不得。　　命中敵艇　　趁着敵人的大意，我　竭力接近，終於迫近到一千米以內，美國潛艇因而大爲狼狽，倉皇用尾部魚雷管放出兩枚魚雷，急圖逃走。我們繼續猛進，衝近到三百米，射出必中彈，兩顆砲彈先後命中潛水艇的司令塔，看到敵兵在濛濛的硝烟中逃命的樣子，總算出了剛才所受的鳥氣。等到彈烟消散時，潛艇上面的八吋砲已灣曲如飴糖一般了。這時，我艇所發的砲彈又打中了潛艇砲塔與司令塔中間的甲板，開了一個大洞，敵兵亂成一團糟，狼狽不堪。這樣，潛艇是不能再潛水了，可是我方損失也不小，砲彈已弓用完，救生用小船也中彈破損，尚且可能使用的武器祇剩四桿來復槍了。我們拔出刀，全體準備在監視艇沈沒後實行自裁。這時候，敵方的砲彈似乎也已用盡，十二吋砲和機關砲等，都默不作聲。敵兵一面大搖機關槍，一面急急修理甲板。　　[捕住它！]我們大聲喊道，整一整頭上包着的布，預備肉搏。他們於是慌忙丟下敷設用的水雷，開足馬力逃竄。　　可惜得很，因爲我艇跑不快，終於讓那艘潛艇逃走了。（譯自九月二十四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>科學的決戰</h3>
<p>——各國的技術動員——　　大戰的形勢，具有物量戰與科學戰的性格，日益明顯，故科學家技術家的動員，成爲戰勝的決定要素。交戰各國，現正拚命凝結科學家們的頭腦，以求其如何發揮效果，而成爲戰力化。日本方面，動員科學家的各種措置，逐漸走上軌道，官廳方面，公布關於技能者動員的敕令，以求航空機的增產，還是最近的事。學術研究會議則就研究與作戰，生產結合一層，向各方提出建議。現將各主要交戰國的科學技術動員態勢，約略介紹於後：　　德國　　在四年計劃局長官戈林元帥絕對的指揮下，統轄企劃動員的一切，科學動員也在一九四二年依據元首命令公布的航空研究管理法實行，航空科學成爲動員的重點，科學院即當其衝。其後史庇亞氏出膺軍需部長，研究所的指揮權及爲戰時生產而動員科學家的權限，移讓史氏。以史氏爲委員長，羅致陸海空軍代表者及軍需工塲的指導者的委員會，最近重新組織，使戰綫與研究所唇齒相依，合作無間，所以陸續產生無人飛機VI號等新兵器。　　蘇聯　　蘇聯的研究機關，直屬於學士院及各人民委員會，其主要任務，學士院爲從事於基礎的研究，委員會的機關則致力於應用的研究，而另有有一個綜合的組織，使之戰力化，爲研究·採用·決定及生產的媒介，統轄甚爲強固。　　美國　　一九四○年六月德英開戰後不久，美國着手技術的戰時動員，組織國防研究委員會，（Ｎ·Ｄ·Ｒ·Ａ），政府由各部長官爲委員，直屬於國防會議。此爲以官方及民間科學家爲中心的組織，委員長爲哈佛大學學長康奈特，就任以後從事於科學家的戰時編成。其後歐洲戰事日益進展，此項組織已緩不濟急，不久大總統最高諮詢機關的緊急管理局（○·Ｅ·Ｍ），即吸收國防研究委員會，委員由陸海軍代表充任，陸軍大將李却特·摩亞，海軍少將巴埃爾亦參加是會，實行作戰的緊密連携，內容成爲實質化，同時，美國的戰時科學技術動員的最高司令部，亦由此成立。　　翌年，爲強化研究的統轄，握有執行權的研究行政官廳緊急管理局，其下設科學研究振興局（○·Ｓ·Ｒ·Ｄ），至前年復設生產研究振興局（Ｃ·P·Ｒ·Ｄ)，於此自研究以至生產一連串的指導行政，都完成強化實施的態勢。（德忠）</p>
<h3>培里琉島勇士的鬥志</h3>
<p>帛琉羣島的培里琉島上，日軍依然確保着飛行塲，白晝躱在陣地裹忍氣吞聲，到了晚上則派遺肉薄攻擊班，潛入敵陣，給予損害，如此地繼續健門着。在那樹木繁茂，開滿紅色佛桑花的島上，美兵的屍體行將築成景觀。日本陸海軍的將士，將奮勇作戰，直到最後。　　今年春夏之間，我會在帛琉羣島的可洛爾島勾留了若干時日。從那時起，帛琉君島便是敵軍注目的所在。自從三月末美國機動部隊強襲以來，在六月馬里亞納海空戰中，帛琉早已是重要的前綫基地，非常活躍。那時以還，敵方對帛琉羣島視同眼中釘，每日都來侵擾。他們所以向必阿克島及其他西北幾內亞的基地前進，旣在準備菲島作戰，又爲造成攻擊帛琉羣島的立足點。至於他們於帛琉羣島中選擇培里琉島爲上陸這處，則因該島有飛行塲，如能奪得該地，即可作爲進攻菲島的航空基地。　　帛琉羣島是一串美麗的珊瑚島，與塞班島的情形不同，是一羣多小島和港灣的島嶼。其間，可洛爾島即其中心，北隔水道，有帛琉島，南有培里琉島，自可洛爾島至該處，如乘大發動艇，約三小時可到。培里琉島是珊瑚礁特有的低島，島上幾無產物，不過是內南洋的重要航空根據地　　馬里亞納海戰以後，敵軍的意圖在於菲島，甚爲明顯，所以從位置而言，恰在菲律賓羣島民大諾島旁邊的帛琉君島，必定首當其衝，這是早巳料到的。因此，守備該君島的陸海軍將士，都是氣意沖天，熱血沸騰的。　　意氣吞敵　　[就是一個人，也得多拼掉幾個敵兵。這是我唯一的念頭。]當我離島之時，海軍某士官在分袂時會如此對我說。　　[他們一定會來進攻培里琉的。塞班島的血債，一定在我們手裹算它清來！]一個和我很熟識的培里琉島守兵慷慨激昂地說。　　[塞班島上的人做得那樣好，我們也得不輸於他們才好！]一個留在島上協助軍隊的日僑毅然地向我保證道。　　島上軍民滅敵的意氣如何旁礴，這是我非常明白的。而且，雖在如此緊張的空氣中，將士們仍舊泰然自若。在我留於島上的期間內，從沒有聽到他們說過一聲玉碎或戰死之類的話。他們祇想擊滅敵兵，每人都要多殺幾個。可是，他們雖然殺氣騰騰，一有閒暇，便悠然打着口哨，唱着歌曲，從事種植山薯和南瓜。我想到那批早已預期今日這種事情而悠悠然在田裹工作的將士們，很明白他們爲何準備迎擊上陸的敵軍，充分吐出深藏腹底的務必撲滅敵軍的殺氣。他們一定會像鬼神一般凶猛作戰的！（川野報道班員）（譯自九月二十四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>菲列賓羣島附近形勢圖</h3>
<p>菲島東方海面蠢動之敵美艦隊，經連日來日海空軍猛攻，擊滅殆盡。雷伊泰灣內敵船艇及登陸軍，亦陷於殲滅之境，日軍把握制海空權，繼續追擊中。白茅</p>
<h3>月下</h3>
<p>— 桑神</p>
<p>今夜月團圓，徘徊不忍看；人情悟冷淡，世事味辛酸；家破他鄉客，竊愁無米餐；河山空極目，淚落橫闌干。　　今夜月光如水，浸透我整個的小屋，以及屋子裹的書櫃，桌·椅·牀……那股沁人骨髓的寒意觸在我的臉上；口·眼·鼻……驅散了我的夢和倦態，頓時從牀上躍起，推開窗柵子，踏着洋台上的月光，我就這末漫不經意的倚在欄干上眺望着，眺望着；領略着當前的夜色，悠悠然地我忘記了時間也忘記了空間存在的一個[我]。　　這末樣地沈默着不知有多少時候，我又突然被一股憂鬰氣所襲擊，那裹面滲雜了日間的人世的煩惱，生活的煎迫：等，更不知有苦辣酸甜等滋味，只覺得那股氣從心底升起，升起—實在我沒有抑止它的力量，於是祇想發洩，隨手就寫了如上面的一首詩，但在復吟詩，覺得詩極，粗淺，想撕掉它；但同時又想想，還可透露我此刻時的些許心緒，但珍惜地藏在常隨身畔的一冊日記薄裹了。　　該是夜沈深的時候，懸在中天的月亮似一個擦亮的小銀餅，溶溶水銀液傾潑着幽冷的悽涼味，月光下黑影憧憧，幻出虎豹熊獅，魔鬼：等形形狀狀，織成一個陰森森可怖的世界，籠罩着黑暗和寂寞。這是在白天所沒有的，正與白天的煩囂，喧雜，熱悶，緊張，對比的成爲了另一個世界。但是厭煩了日間的繁雜囂張的，則毌寗接受了夜的平靜，寂寞。雖然夜是黑暗而可怖的。　　[飛觴醉月]巳沿江有這種慷慨的豪興，即使[舉杯邀明月，對影成三人]那樣的獨酌也覺不感興趣。是年歲已葬送了熱情嗎？不是。是暫時心緒感染到落莫嗎？不是。：是什麼？我實在也不知道我自己啊！皎柔的月亮光是誰都愛好的，尤其鍾情的男女們，對她特有好感，甚而因之薄漾，誘惑。但我從月亮光的感發，却激起一股憂鬰味，或者是激忿—那是由於在動亂的時代，對人世的酸辛，預感如何打發一串串[明日]的恐慌而起的。　　行年未滿三十，但實在已在三十邊上了，古人說[三十而立]，可是對[立]我素無好感，而且有些憎恨。[立的什麼呢？]我時時這樣感喟着，或者說是奚落着。在這年頭兒，提起生活，不是在[生]在[活]，是在受難，磨折，速死；即如以我爲例：一點點死薪水，怎麼擋得住瘋狂式日漲夜大的物價呢？[薪][水]兩字眞是太附杯[水]車[薪]的意義了，使人無法想到它能有濟於事的。於是如我一個人的工作所入連一已糊口巳覺困難，何況還要瞻養一家四口呢？眼前唯一的辦法，只有典物和借貸兩條路。但典物有盡時，借貸有遭拒絕的危險，這不過暫時的補救，不可期之永久。眞的到了羅掘俱空，或者門可羅雀那樣沒有朋友的時候，那只有挺死來結束生活。這並不是我故意說得這末樣的沈痛，除此之外實在再沒有辦法了。於是我常在担憂着這個明日的日子呵！　　現在月光浸透的這個屋子，以前每夜有着許多賓客的，雖不敢說：[座上客常滿，樽中酒不空]。但幾個熟朋友至少每都要來聚聚的，——他（她）們的臉自然被月。亮照得熟透熟透。但年來朋友們來的次數隨着物價指數的上漲面反比例的減少，到現在爲止，除了我的妻兒外，實在我不出另外一個人了。於是我離羣而素居着。這到底是什麼原故呢？或者有人要這樣問我，或者照熟他（她）們臉的月亮驚訝他（她）們的不來而問我，我的回答是很簡單的：還不是爲了貧迫？年來因生活困頓，祇得老着臉向朋友們借錢，一個，二個……一次，二次……於是朋友們對我討厭了，足趾向別人家走。偶然在路上相值，遠遠已見他（她）們廻避了。或者有時撞着了，談不到二三句，即半逃半跑了。我自己明白他（她）們怕我又要提起錢了。錢，錢，錢，生活，生活，生活，於是我被侮辱着，廻避着，給遺棄在社會的一角，整個的世界忘記我，整個的人羣忘記我。眞是沒有辦法，還有什麼說的啊！　　因之又懷疑了我自己處世的能力，想想自已不及人家的地方是什麼？還不是父母遺留下來的一個硬直的性子，孤高月傲，處處不肯向人低頭；不會鑽營，奉迎，不屑投機撈橫蕩等更不願[昏夜乞憐，白晝驕人]的做二重人格者，乃至一貧如洗至此。爲現社會所恥笑，成爲現社會中一個大大的獃子呢！現在社會是錢的世界，虛榮的社會誰的錢多則誰的本領大，地位高，受人的尊敬和得榮譽。但我沒有這種賺錢的能耐，怎麼辦？　　從月亮光下回顧妻兒們酣熟的睡容，是平靜的，酣蜜的，我不忍想，我也這麼樣地想，他（她）們都是無辜的，但遭遇到亂世貧迫不幸的生活，這責職當然歸之於我這爲丈夫的爲父親的肩上，然而茫茫夜，茫茫的世界，多從那裹去找尋出路？爲自己爲妻兒們開闢一條生活—幸福安樂之門呵？　　月亮西移了，投上一抹白光在窗幕上，夜氛更深沈可怖了。該是我回室的時候，但還有一些留戀；突然一隻手在欄干一碰，却感到冷冰冰的一堆濕潤，該是雨滴露珠吧，但天上萬里無雲，繁星點點，於是我驚奇到那是我的淚，從我眼眶裹流出來的。我垂首捧着臉悄悄地回室，讓月亮掛在西天，沈默地，沈默地……</p>
<h3>處世</h3>
<p>— 蓓蕾</p>
<p>將別人的經騐，作爲自己的經騐，不要重蹈人覆轍。　　好事情應從好處着想，壞事情必須自壞處着眼　　在自己心目中準備着一個將來，不時將現在的自己，和將來的自己相比較，如此，尚可以看出其間的不同來，如果能免除了這不同地方，就是理想成爲事實的明徽。　　設法造成有秩序的生活，因爲要謀發展，非先有嚴肅的生活不可。　　寗可從堅苦中積一文錢，不可做投機而獲得百萬金，因爲堅苦中得來的錢不致濫用，投機的錢，終歸難於久留。　　不要將你心裹所想的完全告訴人家，說話的聲音應當低沉動聽，往往你怎樣說，比你所說的東西，更重要一點。　　對於別人的要求，不輕易許諾，可是一旦答應，就必須忠實地守約，無論多大的犧牲，亦在不計之例。　　先勿論這是誰做的工作，對於優良的成績，當不吝讚美，要是需要批評的話，當着意地批評，使人得到眞正的益處，切不可露出輕視的神氣。　　常常愉快，把你的痛苦收拾起來，把你的憂慮和失望，都藏在微笑下面</p>
<h3>喜鵲與烏鴉</h3>
<p>— 楊石年</p>
<p>…在我家的東南角上，有一棵很高很大的銀杏樹，單就它的四五個人還抱不住的本身看來，可以知道這一定是好幾百年以前的老古物了。年數一久，枝木一繁，望去就有些陰森森的氣象，不要說胆小的朋友，會對它生着[疑神疑鬼]的心理，就是一般人們，也因爲它的魁梧龐大，總有些不敢靠近它。　　…本來像這樣一處綠樹陰濃的下面，眞可以大大的利用一下。假如在它的四周，圍上一圈椅子，老的，少的，男的，女的，不妨都來小坐片刻，一面談談[山海經]，一面讓陣陣微風，帶去一天的辛勞，在一個沒有近代都市享受的鄉間，這也可以算是一處休憇的好地方。可是由於歷年來村人們對於它的遠避，於是它的四周，竟成爲人跡不到的荒野，而那枝幹繁茂的樹陰間，也就作爲烏鵲們出沒之所了。　　…每日黎明，天還沒有十分亮，我就被一陣陣烏鴉的長鳴所驚醒，但我往往不肯就起來，利用那晨間最清醒的頭腦，開始思想起一切來，我想着學校裹老師們一只只板着的臉，我想着將來甜蜜的希望。這樣的胡思亂想，直等到一羣喜鵲們在我屋頂上亂噪一陣以後，這才是我想身的時候，然後盥洗，早膳，到學校，我從來不會遲到，也從來不會早得連校門都沒有開。祇要天下下雨，烏鴉與喜鵲，却無形的成了我的兩個時計。這在我追憶起我童年時代的故鄉生活之際，總不能忘情他們對於我的多年忠實的服務。的確，我是應當感謝他們給我這樣多的好處的。　　…是不是人們自私的心理，或是一種不合理的偏見，總是說烏鴉不好，喜鵲才是幸福的象徵，這種傳說，不知起源於那時，也不知這裹面藏着會麼神奧的玄理，說人們的幸福和禽烏有關。我雖然也會請教過比我知道得多的老輩們，但他們也不過是拿它漫不經心人云亦云般的傳說，也說不出所以然來。假如拿他們的形態來講，一般的漆黑的身子，假如拿他們的聲音來講，那末烏鴉的憂然長鳴起來，總也未必輸於喜鵲的[雀，雀]亂噪罷。不過，奇怪的是這種毫無根據的假說，居然能夠牢固在每個國人的心裹，經久不變。記得那一年，正在我父親病重的時候，這也是在事後方始由家人們告訴我，說那天有許多烏鴉，齊集在我家屋頂上[呀，呀]的呌個不休，接着我父親就在這天去世了。即使烏鴉確能預知我父親的死，那末，那些喜鵲們，每天在我家門前，不斷的飛來飛去，又不知給了些怎樣的幸福與我的？我並不爲聽到了烏鴉的嘹聲而感到不快，也不會爲了聽到了一二聲喜鵲的低喧，而覺得過份的喜悅，我祇是把他們當然我自然間的朋友，的確，它們能使我在冷僻的鄉間，劃破了靜寂。　　…但是年歲一大，就不會再有幼年時代的童穉的心，有人說[人過中年，憂患獨多]，雖然我也不致有着怎麼[了不起]的愁苦，或是怎樣大的刺激，不過要像從前那樣的閒情逸致，現在是再也提不起來了，我不能再在聽到了鳥鴉和喜鵲們的不整齊的呌，而覺得這是自然間的呼聲，心裹激起一種會意的共鳴。我的腦中，再也沒有靈感的思潮，却充滿了生活鞭策的創痕，我開始爲了他們吵醒了我　間的好夢而咀咒着,他們竟放不過我這一些僅有的喘息的機會，讓生活的擔子，一天天不斷的重壓在我的肩上。　　…離開故鄉，不覺將近十個年頭，在這個都市中，是瞧不見那樣高大的樹，聽不到烏鵲們的呌聲，使覊旅異地的游子，又不能不憧憬着過去了。不知那棵枝幹繁盛的銀杏樹，是不是比從前更爲陰濃，還有那羣烏鴉和喜鵲，和我分別了十年，是否仍在寂靜的清晨，呌破了每個人的夢。</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聊賽評兩塲甲組精彩戰</h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>申報盃籃球上一週間展開空前盛況，尤以週五油隊中北之役，吸引力出乎意料之外，非但門票早於六時以前售罄，而迷總之球迷鵠立門外，直至終塲，徘徊不散，當局對於塲地之未能容納大量觀衆，深致歉意也。茲錄上週間之甲組全部戰績，及評論二塲最值得一論之戰：　　上週甲組戰績　　廿三日（星期一）明星勝Ｖ隊三十—廿三中北勝華南四一—三一　　廿五日（星期三）華聯勝同仁六四—二五華南勝大華四六—四○　　廿七日（星期五）明星勝仁餘廿四—廿一汕隊勝中北四五—卅三　　以上各戰中，當以華南勝大華，及汕隊勝中北之二塲，使球壇有轉變氣氛。後起有人，老弱者遂在淘汰之列，此固良好現象。且使我人明瞭籃球階段，徒灅技術，而乏適當平均之氣力，難有作爲也。光論大華慘敗於華南之役：　　大華氣力不如調度失策　　大華將士，頗多球壇知名之士，如陸鍾恩許文奎陳祥龍。然人老珠黃，不免有美人遲暮之感。而該隊所採戰術係人釘人。夫要運用人釘人非有充沛之氣力不爲功。以上列如陸陳二人，至多僅能維持上半時之局面，故下半時一見有破綻之時，即應用車輪戰調人，俾可阻敵。至低限度，自覺力有不逮，應設法改用聯防術，稍事省力。雖非得策，亦不可不爲也。華南之勝大華；在氣，在精神。有進步，固值得敬佩。唯戰術方面，尚嫌不足。觀乎對方一用人釘人後，乃僅賴無把握之遠射，尤以何金貴之被張邦綸釘煞，此固爲邦綸之成功，然亦華南尚未成功之點。緣破人釘人法，應用速度調換擋人，不應使何金貴徒謀空跑中覓隙路，烏足取耶？望該隊指導張樂深加研究，盡力指導，則華南之前途，實有無限之光榮。</p>
<h3>汕隊攻有速度射籃奇準</h3>
<p>汕隊之勝中北，由於全賽過程而言，絕無倖致。汕隊鑒於中北之生疎，一上塲即取速戰速攻。中北不及準備，一瞬間接連獲分，乃爲奠定勝局之基礎。茍或汕隊力主穩紥穩打，則萬無初上塲有如此之收穫，而能終獲勝利。中北技術當屬不差，長力亦尚可。最顯著之失敗點乃在生疎而已。觀乎其所賴以爲獲分綸之沈聿恭，僅獲一球而巳。實鮮於練習之故。否則以聿恭百步穿楊，十能中其七八，則勝負之分，尚難斷言也。汕隊在苦幹中訓練出來，有此收穫，足以告慰。筆者極　其勝不驕，繼續努力，再求深造則幸矣。</p>
<h3>明晚華聯華南兩雄相遇</h3>
<p>本週甲組秩序中，以明晚華聯華南之戰，爲最使球迷矚目。預測勝利，當屬諸華聯。唯後者旣挾打敗大華之餘威，今戰必有發展。所望者，華南應知如何利用何金貴，決不能以其爲人看煞，而置之於不顧，則成功必多。</p>
<h3>爲聯誼談戰葡商之關鍵</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>聯誼本屆重整旗鼓，刷新陣容，並有羅壽福小將之加入，故球迷已刮目相看。今日在聯賽中相逢葡商會，筆者冀望於聯誼者深，故略作獻詞。　　緣在第二次福利賽中，兩隊會相逢，聯誼以四對二勝，但不能以此作定論。蓋葡商前戰係本季第一砲，不免有[季初病]之象，現巳經數次比賽，巳現純熟，聯誼應知攻守最重要關鍵。　　切斷蘇若考司坦之連繫　　時常可以看到Ｖ蘇若正在埋頭盤球之時，考司坦即竭力覓取空隙，當Ｖ蘇君在盤球的時候，除一個人去阻止時，極應當再有一個人釘牢考司坦。否則被他覓得空隙，是極危險的。這一條連繫綫，聯誼要想法切切的切實實斷他。其次福恩右路的活躍，應以瞿永福與之死　，萬萬不可放鬆。此人一有機會，極能收效，阿福應愼之。　　小羅麒麟應作密切傳遞　　葡商中衛綫，除奧列維拉確智勇俱全外，Ａ柯拉沙之右前衛，全係一匹夫之勇。所以小羅麒麟應作密切傳遞，應逃過此子，乃有深入腹地而奏效之希望。又悉，高保正已返滬，充右翼之職，極爲理想。蓋保正能有速度，讓他飛奔一番，維克泰格林堡輩，必將走頭無路。則正是怪脚許文奎尋空檔頭之機，我相信阿奎今日應有較好之鏡頭矣。</p>
<h3>前途無量之華南球隊</h3>
<p>華南籃球隊組織之初，隊員均爲愚園路一帶少年，以劉家弟兄爲主體。後改稱爲華南體育會。最近隸屬於廣東旅滬同鄉會體育部。有　雪松之主持，並得體育家前輩張樂之熱心指導。故球藝突飛猛晉，巳成爲堅強之球隊。球員劉福善李賢政在復旦大學肄業，劉福強在南通大學，劉福基鄧國墇關綠昌在約翰大學，福基且善話劇。何金貴李瑞鴻係留日學生，現在公用局服務。鄧英眞亦在求學。少年英俊，前途未可限量也。</p>
<h3>球壇拾零</h3>
<p>中北領隊戴昌齡，心廣體胖。前晚與汕隊戰，六時前即到塲。在樓下進餐後，購票數十張，在收票員旁，分派與隊員同來之人，俾一律憑劵入塲。此公旣熱心提倡體育，又樂於慷慨解囊。　　家融家萬家標，對於運動，與趣濃厚。申報杯籃球甲組比賽，每塲必到。語人云，來觀球賽，可以增加助學經費，故更感興趣。　　汕隊勝中北後，林作詩云：當繼續努力，決不敢以此自滿。蓋事實上，中北實疎於練習，故能取勝。　　張邦綸之籃球技術，有謂較足球爲佳，實有見地。　　培成電業廠主辦之鳳凰盃籃球，定今日舉行閉幕典禮，有三塲精彩籃球，並有名人影星給獎，當局並印有特刋，預料屆時必有盛況，地點在華山路華影球塲。　　周文　，明星隊隊員中均呼[大姊]。　　緣隊嚴雯乃球塲上[甜姐兒]，以其滿臉笑容也。（球大王）</p>

<p>籃球在其初始期，巳孕育其偉大成功的因素，創始在一個訓練青年會幹事的學校。幹事畢業後，散佈在全美國各處青年會服務，担任健身房事工，籃球運動因之極迅速普遍於全美。熱心體育的哥力克博士，見到籃球發達的可能性，將那氏所定的極簡單規則，獻議加以擴充，首先爲美國業餘運動會採用。跟着第二年，各大學就紛紛開始籃球訓練。一八九三年，耶魯大學組織籃球隊，爲各大學有籃球隊之最早者。一九○○年艾博特Senda　Abbott，在史密夫女子大學Smith-College，首創女子籃球。一九○二年，首屆大學校際籃球聯賽，應運而生。一九○五年，美國西部開籃球會議。此後各中學，民衆教育館，體育團體，專門職業，及工業機關，專門職業，及工業機關，均習籃球運動，不久籃球運動就普遍發達，以至普及於全世界各國各地　　籃球傳到東方，也極其迅速。在其創始的第二年，即一八九二年，就傳到中國。美國巴林司頓大學，籃球中鋒蓋利BooGailey，首先將籃球帶到天津。同年柏頓氏Duncan　Patton，到印度去，亦將籃球傳入印度。一九○○年，石川Lshakawa又將籃球傳入日本。拳匪亂時，美國聯軍入京以後，籃球也跟着美軍，伸張到我國北平。一九一六年美甘省大學Kanses　“U“畢業生施那Charles　Siler，在我國天津振興籃球運動，並加以發展。因得風氣之先，無怪天津後來，成爲我國產生籃球好手的策源地。一九○五年，甘省美軍第二十團，派赴菲律賓，在分士頓Fred　Funston領導之下，籃球也在菲島擴張起來。至歐洲方面，因美國派出傳教士及青年會幹事，到歐洲各地服務，不出幾年之間，籃球遍及歐洲各大都市。籃球之能在短期內，傳遍全球，爲各種運動所不及，其給與各國人士健康與娛樂上之價值，實堪爲吾人所讚揚也。　　最初籃球規則，祇十三條，係那氏在一八九二年所訂定。這種規則當時名爲青年會規則，後來由哥力克博士獻議，業餘運動會將其擴充至二十二條。但經擴充後之規則，因各方解譯不同，會引起紛亂與衝突。同時學校聯合會，職業球隊，各訂本身通用規則，形成各立門戶的現象。這種情形，直至一九一五年，在籃球規則聯合會組織成功以後，方始消滅。聯合委員會之組織，係加拿大體育會，學校聯合會，曁業餘運動會等，派出代表組織而成。一九三三年道聯委會同意解散。另產生一繼任團體，即現在之美國及加拿大全國籃球委員會，TheNauonal　Bassketball　Committee　of　The　United　State　and　Canada。我國會一度將美國規則的主要點修改，成爲現在所採用之國際籃球協會規則。上海西僑青年會，一向所採用的爲美國規則，而中國青年會所用的爲國際規則，球隊有不明瞭此點者，故常發生誤會，殊屬遺憾。籃球規則委員會在每年九月，籃球季節開始之先，開會討論規則存廢增減等問題。自遠東運動會停辦，國際規則於民國二十七年起，至今未會修改　　一九四○年，筆者在春田大學完成學業，行將回國之際，籃球發明者那氏，被邀返母校，向舊同學演講，得與他再會一面。據他當時對我說，他一生最感愉快者，莫過於一九三六年，他被邀到柏林世運會，看見二十一國參加籃球比賽的代表隊，各排列在其本國國旗飄揚之下，聽他說幾句恭祝與道賀的話。第一塲比賽，爲中國對日本。決賽冠軍的一塲，爲美國對加拿大，而由中國之舒鴻君擔任裁判。後來他被請到一個歡宴會，出席者有十九個春田大學舊生，皆是各國籃球代表隊的指導。那時他內心的愉快，不可以言喻。他想不到四十五年前他的發明，會有這樣偉大的成就。他更想不到，籃球會成爲今日國際間建立聯誼的運動。那氏不幸於一九四○年，在美國病逝世。然而他的精神，他的貢獻，是永遠值得爲全世界各國人士所崇仰的。</p>

<h3>Enemy Transport Fleet Burning in Leyte Gulf, Japanese New Submarines Actively Respond to Air and Sea Operations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Japanese air forces are continuously and fiercely attacking enemy ships within the Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, as well as enemy bridgeheads near Tacloban and Tarac, achieving significant results repeatedly. From the night of the 25th to the morning of the 26th, it was determined that 35 enemy ships had been sunk, damaged, or run aground. Additionally, 29 others were bombed and caught fire. Furthermore, in the battle on the 25th, an enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed and rendered inoperable. Approximately 70 of its carrier-based aircraft landed on Tacloban Island and the Tarac bridgehead. Consequently, since the attacks began on the 19th, the enemy's aircraft losses have reached 108. Small enemy ships wandering in the Leyte Gulf, spanning approximately 100 kilometers, are on the verge of collapse under the control of the Japanese air forces. Currently, Japanese aircraft are still sortieing to pursue and employ crash tactics, destroying numerous enemy ships. Additionally, Japanese land forces are repeatedly launching fierce attacks on enemy bridgeheads at Tacloban and Tarac, gradually expanding their advantageous position. Enemy landing forces, witnessing the tragic sight of their support ships being fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft, have lost almost all will to fight. Philippines Base, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese air force reconnaissance, on the morning of the 26th, 80 enemy transport ships within Leyte Gulf were unable to escape eastward, merely wandering within the bay, with 27 of them on fire, their smoke visible from afar. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Following the recent naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, Japanese submarines have been actively engaged, responding proactively to the operations of the Japanese naval and air forces, achieving significant results. On the 24th, Japanese submarines attacked an enemy transport fleet in the eastern waters of the Philippines, sinking one large transport ship. Subsequently, on the same evening, they attacked another large enemy transport fleet of approximately 20 ships, sinking 12. Furthermore, on the night of the 25th, they attacked enemy aircraft carrier groups, sinking one large aircraft carrier and one destroyer, totaling five ships. In addition to the confirmed sinking of two enemy ships during the attack on the night of the 24th, it is believed that several other enemy ships were sunk, although unconfirmed. Therefore, there is high anticipation for the future activities of Japan's new submarines from all sides.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Leyte Battle, Japanese Forces Employ Accurate Bombardment</h3>
<p>Dozens of Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Burned Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – American forces landing on Leyte Island are attempting to gradually expand their bases westward. The interception of enemy carrier-based aircraft near the landing sites on Leyte Island has not been successful as the Japanese forces have secured air superiority. Furthermore, with damage to the aircraft carriers, the appearance of smaller aircraft has gradually decreased. The enemy forces are eager to seize air superiority, dispatching large B-24 bombers from the rear areas of Morotai and Peleliu, and ordering dozens of carrier-based aircraft to land near Tacloban in an attempt to secure airfields. However, after fierce attacks by Japanese forces, the aircraft were completely burned and destroyed, and several locations at the Tacloban and Tarac airfields were set ablaze to prevent their use by the enemy. At the same time, Japanese land forces have also secured the western highlands of Leyte, employing accurate bombardment. The enemy forces and ships fear Japanese night attacks and dare not turn on lights. Enemy ships within Leyte Gulf are deploying numerous transport ships to cover the reinforcement of landing forces. The defense and offense battle in the Philippines is becoming increasingly fierce. Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American forces landing in Leyte Gulf have suffered repeated defeats, and their morale has greatly declined, showing signs of wavering. They are currently trying to reverse their perilous situation and are continuously reinforcing Leyte Gulf, while also taking advantage of bad weather to carry out supply operations. On the other hand, naval gun bombardments, which had been suspended since the 23rd, resumed on the 26th. American forces landing near Tarac are attempting to expand their bases, gradually invading westward. On the 25th, they reached the vicinity of San Pablo, west of Tarac, and a battle for the airfield there is expected soon. Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American forces landing on Leyte Island, in an attempt to recover their mobilized maximum base air power, are continuing attacks. Meanwhile, in an attempt to respond to the attacks of the Japanese air force with their own air force, they recklessly transferred dozens of carrier-based aircraft to the Tacloban airfield. The Japanese forces launched a preemptive strike against this air force, wiping it out in one fell swoop. At 3:13 PM on the 26th, Japanese aircraft began their attack, repeatedly strafing the dozens of American aircraft on the ground, causing all of them to catch fire and burn. As a result, the American aircraft that landed at great risk have been completely lost. At the same time, the landing airmen and maintenance personnel appear to have been forced to temporarily evacuate.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Chief's Broadcast Hints at Defeat</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American side is still engaging in its usual style of false propaganda regarding the naval and air battle between the Japanese and American main fleet in the Philippine Sea, exaggerating the losses on the Japanese side as much as possible. However, such propaganda cannot conceal their weak fighting ability. According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Navy Secretary Forrestal broadcast on the night of the 27th, stating that the American fleet also suffered considerable losses in this naval battle and that the Japanese navy, although suffering losses, still possesses formidable power, a point that cannot be ignored. These few words alone hint at the American defeat. Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. naval authorities have announced that at least 17 of the U.S. Navy's entire fleet of 20 battleships are currently in various areas of the Pacific. Furthermore, the battleship California, which was sunk at Pearl Harbor at the start of the war, has been repaired and is participating in combat. Additionally, the two 27,000-ton super cruisers, Alaska and Guam, have also been requisitioned. These ships are 750 feet in length and are equipped with nine 12-inch guns.</p>
<h3>New List of Japanese Cabinet Advisors Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to the decisive battle phase, the Japanese government has decided to establish a cabinet advisory system. Furthermore, it will proceed with the selection of new cabinet advisors. It has now been decided that 12 individuals, including former Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, will be appointed. The list of cabinet advisors, approved by His Majesty the Emperor after being reported by Prime Minister Koiso, is as follows: Hachiro Arita, Minobu Ono, Nobumasa Suetsugu, Teijiro Toyoda, Yuzuru Yuki, Kamezaburo Yamashita, Yosuke Yatsukawa, Hirotaro Ando, Shinzo Koizumi, Rikitaro Shoriki, Matajiro Koizumi, and Kiyonobu Yoshida.</p>
<h3>National Government Presents Medals to Japanese Diplomats</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The National Government, in order to commend the meritorious service of 101 Japanese diplomatic officials stationed in China, has awarded them the Tongguang Medal respectively.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Army Encourages Production and Awards Mitsubishi Factory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force has seized favorable opportunities to continuously and fiercely attack the U.S. Task Force 58 cruising in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the mobile fleet in the eastern waters of the Philippines. The enemy American forces have suffered defeat, and the Japanese forces have achieved great results, as repeatedly announced by the Imperial Headquarters. The achievement of these results is due to the diligent work of the production front. The rear has continuously sent elite bombers to the front lines to meet their needs. The credit for victory should be attributed to this. This proves that Japan's incomparably superior scientific front has surpassed the world. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is responsible for producing elite bombers, and many other cooperating factories have made significant contributions to the overall war effort. In order to commend these factories, the Japanese Ministry of the Army held an award ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 27th in the First Conference Room of the Ministry of the Army. Minister of the Army Field Marshal Sugiyama awarded a certificate of commendation to Kozo Hara, the managing director representing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and encouraged them to concentrate all their efforts on production. The representative replied, pledging to exert all their efforts to meet the expectations.</p>
<h3>Various Locations Prepare to Celebrate Two Major Anniversaries</h3>
<p>Cooperate with Allied Nations in War Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Tomorrow (the 30th) marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the capital will hold a grand celebration ceremony. At 9:00 AM, Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, will lead his staff to visit the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs and senior officials to express congratulations. At 10:00 AM, a celebration rally for the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and a capital residents' celebration assembly will be held at the National Assembly Hall, attended by several thousand people, including civil servants, students, military police, and civilians from various government agencies. The ceremony will be extremely grand. At 6:00 PM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will host a banquet at the International Club for Japanese diplomatic envoys in China. After the banquet, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda will host a preview of the film "Spring River Flows East" for foreign guests, senior officials of the National Government, and figures from the cultural and media circles to express their congratulations. Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Tomorrow (the 30th) marks the anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty, which perfects the war effort and establishes a new era in Sino-Japanese relations, and the 6th of next month marks the anniversary of the declaration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. At a time when the allied forces are reporting frequent victories on land and sea, we feel even more inspired and confident in these two major anniversaries. All levels of our country are actively preparing to commemorate these two major anniversaries, which have great significance. We deeply know that the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty fully adheres to the teachings of the Founding Father, which showed that all countries in Asia should cooperate with the advanced country of Japan with one heart and one mind, and based on the spirit of Eastern morality, to defeat the utilitarianism of the West. For more than a hundred years, the Anglo-Americans have invaded East Asia without any gaps. It is a matter of course that the countries and nations of East Asia rise up to drive out the Anglo-American invading forces for self-defense and self-preservation. The signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty aims to make the comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan the center of stability in East Asia, thereby uniting the countries and nations of Greater East Asia to work together to strike at the Anglo-Americans and eliminate their invading forces in East Asia. However, to defend East Asia and complete the construction of East Asia, it is necessary to use the total strength of all East Asians, help and cooperate with each other, and strive forward under the same belief to complete it successfully. Therefore, the publication of the highest charter for the construction of East Asia (the Greater East Asia Declaration) is the most powerful expression of the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to build East Asia and contribute to world peace. This is consistent with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and is the full expression of the Founding Father's forgotten Pan-Asianism. Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty one year ago, the relationship between the two countries has become closer and the cooperation system has been strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the treaty. It is firmly believed that with the cooperation between China and Japan as the center, we will be able to unite East Asia and work together for the construction of East Asia's co-prosperity. In the past year, our country, from top to bottom, has been doing its best to contribute to the country and to East Asia. In terms of material things, we have saved all unnecessary consumption and stopped all unnecessary enjoyment in order to enrich the war effort and cooperate in the war. In terms of spirit, we have a deeper understanding and increased belief in the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War. However, what we cannot but say is that the stubbornness of the Chongqing side still wants to delay the war, willingly being used by the Anglo-Americans, and inviting the bad name of a traitor to East Asia. As these two major anniversaries in East Asian history are approaching, we sincerely hope that the insightful people in Chongqing will reflect deeply, stop resisting the war as soon as possible, drive out the Anglo-American forces, and preserve a part of the vitality of the country and the nation to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. In short, at this final juncture of China's rise and fall and East Asia's survival, all of our people and the 1 billion people of East Asia must fight with the same hatred and the same steps to defend the survival of our country and to fight for the liberation of East Asia. Only in this way can the construction of a new world begin and the happiness of all mankind can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Germany Deeply Respects the Splendid Results of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Goebbels' Broadcast Speech Last Night Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated in a broadcast on Friday evening that he deeply respects the splendid battle results achieved by our ally, Japan, and its armed soldiers. The Japanese army inflicted a fierce and fatal blow on the American fleet in the naval and air battle off the coasts of Taiwan and the Philippines, causing deep unease among the enemy. Furthermore, in this battle, the Japanese people once again completely eliminated the ambition of Americanism to dominate the Pacific and praised all of Japan's inherent historical traditions. At a time when the determination of life and death and future happiness of both Germany and Japan is near, the German people can only achieve complete victory by working together and fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese people. After the news of Japan's victory reached Germany, the entire country rejoiced. We are honored to stand on the same front with the incredibly brave Japanese people. The War Situation Is Half Good, Half Bad for Germany Goebbels went on to say that in the past three months, important events that have fundamentally changed the war situation have occurred. Among them, some are half good and half bad for Germany. The hopes held by the enemy have not yet been achieved, and the German people have not collapsed due to the enemy's general offensive and the activities of political agitators. The road into Germany is still closed. Although the eastern, western, and southern fronts are still in a very tense situation, there is reason to believe that they will soon stabilize. Fighting for Survival, Never Kneeling Although the war is sometimes difficult, the German nation will never cease fighting unless it obtains guarantees of independence and the right to survive. The enemy is trying to force the German people to kneel based on the development of the war, but in addition to the loss of the enemy's manpower and material resources, the enemy also cannot extend the war indefinitely due to internal political reasons. Therefore, the enemy has also realized the need to end the war as quickly as possible, and the losses will continue to increase significantly. In the race against time, the German people have a real chance of victory. If the German people surrender to the enemy, this world will become a hell for the German people. The Eastern Border Defense Is Strong Then, Goebbels discussed the military situation, saying that the German people have given up most of the land they have occupied since 1940, which is a cause for concern for the German people, but the German people have established a solid defense line on the 1939 line of defense. After the Battle of Arnhem, the enemy no longer mentioned advancing into Berlin. The Soviet army launched offensives on all sections of the eastern front in an attempt to gain a decision before winter, but the Soviet army's manpower resources are by no means inexhaustible, so we can be confident that we will eventually overcome the danger from the east. The wholesale betrayal of the Balkans forced the German people to retreat, but fortunately, Hungary was able to return to the German side at the last minute. Not Afraid to Sacrifice to Achieve Victory What the German people should pay the most attention to now is the terrifying air raids, but Germany's new type of aircraft will provide effective resistance to the enemy. Under constant air raids, Germany is still able to increase the production of munitions and can manufacture new types of weapons and make technical improvements. This can be regarded as the strengthening of a powerful factor that is expected to fundamentally change the war situation. The German people will never let their homeland become a hell, nor will they let their women and children be exterminated and their workers exiled to Siberia. The rules for the life of the German people prescribed by the followers of Morgenthau will never be realized. The only answer to the enemy's crazy plan is to achieve final victory at any cost.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Wilson Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: Lieutenant General Wilson, Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Mediterranean region, recently arrived in Moscow with Major General Edward and a ship captain. It is reported that their trip is related to negotiations on the terms of Bulgaria's armistice.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Jiangkou Market in Southern Guangxi</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Suburbs of Chengdu Southern China Front Japanese Army Base, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army in southern Guangxi, after defeating the Chongqing 95th Division and occupying Xuancun, continued to advance. At dawn on the 25th, they suddenly turned southwest, crossed muddy roads, and approached Jiangkou Market, the base of the Chongqing 135th Division and the 46th Army of the Guangxi Army. After breaking through the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army, they launched a fierce attack and completely occupied the area by dusk on the 26th. Jiangkou Market is located approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Guiping and is the western gateway to the Pingnan Plain, a major stronghold for the Chongqing army to reach Nanning and Liuzhou. Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the Japanese air force bombed the suburbs of Chengdu three times on the night of the 26th, and Chongqing issued warnings for up to five hours.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Underway for Antwerp</h3>
<p>Canadian Forces Land on Beveland Peninsula Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Western Front war remains centered in the Netherlands. The defense and offense battle in the Antwerp area is currently underway. According to German bulletins, German forces are currently fiercely attacking the anti-Axis forces landing on the southern coast of South Beveland Island, behind Antwerp, and have completely thwarted the enemy's attempted advance in the Scheldt area. Bitter street fighting broke out again yesterday near Hertogenbosch. Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Havas News Agency reported that a German military spokesman pointed out that Canadian troops landed in Walcheren and three locations in South Beveland, but were repulsed in two places and only managed to establish a bridgehead in one location. The enemy used amphibious tanks for the first time, and many were destroyed by German forces.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Enter Turkish-Bulgarian Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to German authorities, all Bulgarian troops guarding the Turkish-Bulgarian border must be replaced by Soviet forces. Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Havas News Agency reported: A German military spokesman said that the objective of the German forces in the Balkans is to keep the road from south to north open. In Skopje and Kraljevo, German forces have repelled obstacles along the way. It is expected that the Soviet forces will do their best to block the main routes again, but German forces have taken countermeasures. German Forces Retreat from Finnmark and Northern Norway Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The German leader's headquarters announced on the 27th that German forces have retreated from Beiarmo in northern Finland and Kirkenes in northern Norway. Weekly Review</p>
<h3>Economic Control Plan</h3>
<p>— Guang Zhen</p>
<p>The recent serious problem of commodity prices is actually a problem of imbalance between supply and demand, because commodity prices are merely a manifestation of the relationship between supply and demand.  Recently, the authorities have adopted two methods to suppress commodity prices: one is to set price limits; but in reality, price limits are mere formalities, and they are constantly being raised, with some new price limits even being higher than market prices! The second is to contract the currency; however, the first to be affected is only the devaluation of securities. Commodity prices may temporarily stabilize, but they often rise again soon after. As a result, the currency inflates along with commodity prices, which in turn causes commodity prices to continue to rise.  This situation indicates that the problem of commodity prices cannot be solved solely from the perspective of commodity prices themselves or the relationship with currency. In economics, there is a basic principle: if supply exceeds demand, prices fall; if demand exceeds supply, prices rise. Therefore, the problem of commodity prices must be solved from the perspective of the relationship between supply and demand.  In wartime, due to increased military demand, shortages of materials, and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, the relationship between supply and demand cannot be adjusted naturally. Therefore, it is necessary to implement control, the purpose of which is: 1. To strengthen labor and focus on key production: that is, to increase working hours and intensity, stop the production of non-essential goods, and emphasize the increased production of urgently needed materials. 2. To regulate transportation: due to frequent military transportation and insufficient means of transport, restrict unnecessary transshipment and concentrate on the transport of urgently needed goods. 3. To conserve consumption: for example, restrict entertainment and prohibit brewing, so as to reduce demand. 4. To distribute equally: for example, implement rationing, to suppress hoarding, to equalize enjoyment, and thereby to seek social stability. All of these cannot be achieved by capitalist methods, so it is necessary to adopt a planned and compulsory economic control policy.  As for our country, in order to catch up with industrial backwardness, it is necessary to control not only in wartime but also in peacetime. Because: 1. The evils of the anarchic state of production and distribution under capitalism have long been exposed. Our national capitalism has not yet developed, so there is no need to repeat this mistake. 2. Under laissez-faireism, China can never freely compete with advanced capitalist countries, so it is necessary to implement a comprehensive economic plan in order to develop industry.  However, since our country implemented the control policy, the economic situation has been deteriorating. There are many reasons for this, such as unsound personnel, non-unified powers, too low purchase price limits, improper procurement methods, and delayed and insufficient rationing. In addition, there is a fundamental reason, which is the incompleteness of the control. This can be said from four aspects: 1. Not comprehensive: focusing only on procurement and rationing in the consumption process while neglecting the practice of increasing production. 2. Not universal: the prices of some items that are not subject to control rise daily, eventually affecting the reduction of controlled product production and the rise in black market prices. 3. Comprador nature: procurement and rationing are entrusted to merchants, and merchants collude with corrupt local bullies to exploit producers during procurement, and sell the allocated goods on the black market during rationing, resulting in the allocation of goods that are not available. 4. Lack of power: unable to ensure public security, unable to mobilize funds, unable to command transportation, and government orders cannot be implemented throughout the country, and plans cannot be thoroughly implemented.  If we want to improve the control in the future, the control organization must have political morality, political talent, and political power in order to seek welfare for the country and the people, formulate a comprehensive plan, and enforce it forcefully. This is not something that merchant self-governing bodies can handle. It is best to set up a wise and powerful comprehensive control organization in the government. This organization must be able to directly command finance, finance, production, procurement, transshipment, and distribution, and must be able to directly manage all private enterprises in order to thoroughly implement the entire economic plan.  For example, taking the problem of rice and grain as an example, if we want to suppress the price of rice, we must also suppress the prices of other commodities at the same time, so as not to cause farmers to abandon farming due to losses; therefore, a comprehensive control must be carried out. Secondly, in order to enrich costs and improve cultivation methods, so that farmers can increase production, they must be given material assistance (such as low-interest loans, lending seeds, renting farming tools, and issuing bonuses), and they must be given scientific guidance: this requires the cooperation of finance, industry, agronomy experts, and other aspects. Thirdly, rice should be purchased directly after harvest to save intermediate exploitation, and large-scale transshipment should be carried out to save transportation costs, which requires the ability to mobilize large amounts of funds and command transportation tools. Fourthly, with a fairly accurate estimate of the purchase volume, the rationing volume can also be fairly accurately stipulated. If there is a shortage, mixed grains can be used to stabilize people's livelihood and prevent the black market from running rampant; therefore, procurement, transshipment, and rationing must be managed in a unified manner.  The solutions to other material problems are the same. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive planning and strong economic control organization.  This organization, let us tentatively name it the [National Economic Commission] (the current [National Economic Commission] is like a mere formality and cannot bear this important task), and set up full-time standing committee members, and appoint the three ministers of finance, industry, and construction as concurrent committee members. Economic bureaus are set up in provinces and cities, economic sections are set up in counties and districts, and cooperatives are set up in townships. The association must be able to directly command the three departments of finance, industry, and construction, as well as economic bureaus, sections, and cooperatives. The business policies of private factories, companies, and transportation agencies must also be subject to the association's command, but they are still allowed to obtain reasonable profits.  In addition to the standing committee members, the association has the following departments: General Affairs Office, which handles internal affairs of the association and external negotiations; Planning Office, which handles investigation, research, and design of national economic plans; Adjustment Office, which handles production increase guidance, enterprise adjustment, production fund and tool regulation; Procurement Office, which handles procurement and transshipment; Storage and Distribution Office, which handles storage and rationing; Supervision Office, which handles economic security, suppresses the black market, and punishes hoarding. Economic bureaus, sections, and cooperatives handle comprehensive work according to their needs. As for all other economic institutions, they can all be abolished. The system is listed in the following table: National Government Executive Yuan National Economic Commission Standing Committee - Ministry of Finance Ministry of Industry Ministry of Construction General Affairs Office Planning Office Adjustment Office Procurement Office Storage and Distribution Office Supervision Office Provincial and Municipal Economic Bureau County and District Economic Section Township Cooperative  In addition to the three departments of finance, industry, and construction, which can still work in separate offices, the standing committee and its subordinate departments must work in the same office so as to facilitate regular contact and achieve the effect of comprehensive control. As for the location of the association, it is best to set it up in Shanghai, the national economic center.  The chronic diseases of the Chinese economy are deep-rooted. Curing the head when the head aches and curing the feet when the feet ache will not work. Using capitalist methods is even more insufficient to remedy the situation. If we want to improve, we must carry out planned and strong control of the national economy, so that production can be increased, procurement can be effective, and rationing can be truly rational, and then limit consumption and eradicate hoarding, thereby forcing the adjustment of the relationship between supply and demand. However, this kind of work is definitely not something that people who are only good at speculation or taking advantage of others can do well; this kind of work requires a wise and powerful comprehensive control agency, and those in charge must have public morality, professional knowledge, and strong powers.  In order to strengthen the wartime economy and revive the post-war economy, I only make the above suggestions, and I hope that people from all over the country will discuss and promote them in order to improve the national economy and people's livelihood!</p>

<p>Special Issue Celebrating the Victory of the Philippine Sea Battle</p>
<h3>The Japanese Navy Fulfils Its Mission to Defend Greater East Asia and Establishes Great Achievements, Crushing the Enemy's Two-Year Counter-Offensive Attempt</h3>
<p>— (Zhi Xin)</p>
<p>According to the accurate announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, from October 12th, in the naval and air battles on the sea off Taiwan, the eastern sea off the Philippines, and the inner sea of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, more than 154 American ships have been sunk or destroyed in these 15 days. Large aircraft carriers over 200 meters long, capable of carrying nearly 100 aircraft, as well as battleships with over 1,500 people and equipped with ten heavy artillery pieces, have also sunk in large numbers. Japan has repeatedly stated that if the enemy's two-year counter-offensive approaches, it will definitely give them a decisive blow. This statement was not an empty promise, and it was indeed achieved. The enemy America also knew that approaching Japan would cause damage, but the anxiety to end the war as soon as possible and Roosevelt's ambition to be elected for a fourth term forced them to carry out this irrational operation. The Japanese fleet seized the opportunity and rose up courageously, and the enemy American fleet could not stand it. The Japanese gunners, under the spirit of [one hit is better than a hundred shots, and a hundred artillery pieces are better than one], trained vigorously, so there were simply no missed shells, and the explosives used were the most powerful in the world, so the American ships sank one after another as soon as they met the Japanese ships.</p>
<h3>Enemy American Soldiers Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>America's resources are indeed abundant, but the quality is not high compared to the enemy. Due to the sinking and destruction of as many as 152 ships and fires, the casualties of soldiers must have reached 100,000. The work of naval personnel is very difficult, and it takes at least three years to train a qualified person. And today, their skilled personnel of more than three years have sunk to the bottom of the sea all at once.  It is said that the United States has a population of 130 million, of which 52 million are not of Anglo-Saxon descent, in other words, their parents are foreigners, so there are only 78 million true Americans. This great loss of people must be more painful for the Americans than the loss of warships. Moreover, America's short-term decisive battle is also hopeless. The Japanese Navy has gloriously completed its mission to defend East Asia. The people of Chongqing are the same East Asian people as we are. When they heard the results of the Japanese army, just as Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, said that the people of East Asia were overjoyed when Japan won the naval battle in the Sea of Japan, the people of Chongqing, who have been Americanized on the surface, must also feel excited in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Displays Endurance and Fighting Power</h3>
<p>Building the Ladder of Victory  History is cyclical. The American Navy, which broke the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay in 1898 and laid the foundation for the occupation of the Philippines, suffered a near-total defeat from the Japanese fleet in the decisive battle inside and outside Leyte Gulf 46 years later, and was forced to flee from the Philippines in defeat. However, it would be somewhat dangerous to regard this so-called sea battle on the sea off the Thief Island as an independent battle. In fact, we should remember that this is just a link in the approximately one-year-long Pacific War that began with the battle in the Gilbert Islands in late November last year. That is, during this year, the battles in the Gilbert, Marshall, Mariana, Admiral, and New Guinea Islands were interrelated and mutually influential, with various causal relationships. Therefore, the victory in this sea battle on the sea off the Philippine Islands is definitely not unrelated to other previous battles. In order to create the victory on the sea off the Philippine Islands, the Japanese soldiers in the Gilbert Islands all died for their country, and the defenders of Saipan, Omiya Island, and Tinian also died one after another. The noble sacrifice that became the cornerstone of this decisive victory, its greatness may not be fully understood by some people. However, all these sacrifices have finally become the ladder to victory, which is now clearly visible before our eyes.</p>
<h3>The Combined Fleet Bides Its Time</h3>
<p>It has been about a year since the great battle in the Gilbert Islands, and it really feels like a long battle. During this long year, the Japanese Combined Fleet endured with determination. Especially the Battle of Saipan, when we think of the crisis at that time, we still feel palpitations. At that time, many insightful people also shouted that the Japanese mainland was in danger and advocated that the Combined Fleet come out to attack the American Navy. However, the Combined Fleet persevered even at this time of crisis. Why did the Japanese Combined Fleet persevere and not come out during this year? The reason is very clear. That is, the Japanese Combined Fleet wanted to crush the enemy American fleet on the ocean and make it completely defeated, but its strength was still slightly insufficient. The Combined Fleet itself understood this fact better than anyone else. Therefore, it lured the enemy American fleet into a battlefield that was favorable to the Japanese side, that is, lured it into the sphere of influence of the Japanese base air force, extended the enemy's supply line to the longest, and on the other hand, shortened its own supply line to the shortest, so that the comprehensive strength of the two armies was fully balanced, and they could rise up at once and fight a decisive battle with the enemy. This determination was firm and unwavering during this year. The enemy also understood the basic strategy of the Japanese army, so they took an extremely cautious attitude in the battles unfolding in the Pacific, guarding against the attack of the Japanese Combined Fleet. However, the Japanese Combined Fleet, which finally appeared in this sea battle on the sea off the Philippine Islands, still caused them to suffer a decisive defeat. The reason is that in a true close-range battle between fleets, the American Navy is not a match for the elite Japanese Navy after all.  In short, the Pacific War, which has lasted for a year, has now crossed the highest peak of the decisive battle. The enemy America, which had advanced with great difficulty in the vast Pacific Ocean for more than a year from the Pearl Harbor attack to the Philippine Sea Battle, was instantly overturned by a storm. Its tragic state is not less than Napoleon's expedition to Moscow. What is most impressive in this decisive battle is that Japan won by enduring well. That is, during this year, if there was a lack of endurance in accordance with the basic strategy, then the crown of victory would definitely not be worn on Japan's head today. The importance of the [war of endurance] has now been explained by facts. After this absolute victory, we will never slacken, and we must move forward strongly with the determination that [the war starts today] until the day of final victory.</p>
<h3>Three Outstanding Strengths Are the Decisive Factors in the Victory of the Philippine Sea Battle</h3>
<p>Japanese Naval Experts in Shanghai Analyze  The enemy American fleet has been defeated in the recent naval battles off Taiwan and the eastern sea off the Philippines, and the Allied Japanese Navy has achieved an unprecedented victory. I recently had the pleasure of hearing the following remarks from Japanese naval experts in Shanghai:  [The war on the sea off Taiwan and the Philippines has basically come to an end as of the 26th. In the future, it will only be a matter of mopping up the remnants. In this battle, the enemy American fleet has been largely destroyed. If the enemy America dares to make any further moves in the future, it will be a very interesting question. Although we are not arrogant in victory, we still need to be fully prepared. There are three factors in our victory this time:  First, the excellence of tactics, that is, the excellence of fleet operation methods, the excellence of the commander and the operation staff. The Philippines has more than eighty islands of various sizes. We used these islands to lure the enemy American fleet deep into Leyte Gulf in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, in this battle, the enemy fleet entered Leyte Gulf, and we only annihilated them in one fell swoop seven days later. The enemy did not know how to use the terrain at all. Our fleet, once dispatched, had annihilated most of the enemy fleet within thirty-six hours. Therefore, this excellent Japanese tactic can never be understood by Roosevelt and Forrestal. Secondly, our fleet can sail freely in extremely narrow straits. The enemy's dull staff will never be able to develop such a tactic.  Second, the excellence of science. The United States has always boasted of its sophisticated machinery in the world. However, in this battle, when the Japanese fleet fired the first shot, the enemy's largest cruiser was sunk in just two minutes. This shows the excellence of Japanese artillery machinery and the excellence of explosives. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese artillery can sink American ships at any time, which is beyond the reach of the enemy's artillery and mines. The defensive power of the enemy American warships has always been said to be the best in the world, but they were sunk in an instant.  Third, the excellence of the skills of the soldiers. Japanese soldiers are very excellent in all aspects because they have undergone years of intensive training. Compared with the American army, which has only been trained for a few months, there is absolutely no question about the quality and combat skills.  In short, the naval battle between Japan and the enemy American fleet is like a brave man fighting a hooligan. As soon as our army rushed in, the enemy scattered and fled. In this battle, the enemy flagship sent a telegram for help. The telegram for help should definitely use a code, but the enemy was caught off guard and panicked, so they sent it in plain text. When it was sent to the United States, it also reached Japan and the whole world at the same time. This embarrassing situation is tantamount to telling the world: [The American fleet is on the verge of danger].</p>
<h3>Destroy the Arrogant Enemy's Fighting Power and Strive to Increase Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>— Li Jun</p>
<p>To build on the victory, we must step up production and transmit the bad news; we must vow to increase production even more. How does the aircraft production that the entire nation is engaged in become the fighting power to destroy the arrogant enemies of Britain and the United States? I will briefly describe its system to clarify the reasons why a large amount of materials is needed.  Immediately after the start of the war, the enemy America put up the slogan [Don't Forget Pearl Harbor] and established an aircraft production posture. Recently, it has finally reached a procedure of producing 10,000 aircraft per month, but this cannot immediately fly to our heads. Regardless of the mission country, having aircraft alone cannot establish a large air force. A large number of aviation personnel equivalent to the number of aircraft must be trained. The so-called aviation personnel are not only pilots, but also communication personnel and reconnaissance personnel. These aviation personnel cannot be trained unless they actually ride in the aircraft.  That is to say, to train a batch of aviation personnel, they must fly in the sky from morning to night. Those of you who are familiar with the actual situation of the aviation education team can definitely imagine how the aircraft itself is consumed and how much fuel is needed under such a rapid cycle.  Transport Unit  Secondly, there is the so-called transport unit, which is the logistics line of the air force. Those who think that the air force is still subordinate may have no idea of the scale of the air transport, but in today's world, where the outcome can be said to be determined solely by the air force, it is self-evident how many rear liaison aircraft are needed behind the aircraft operating on the front line. In the aerial war that has shrunk the earth, its rear still has to rely on sea and land transportation; otherwise, the aircraft cannot be used as an aircraft, just like fish without water and birds without wings. We must never forget the distance and speed of aerial warfare, and we must draw a picture of the earth in our minds and face this line squarely. As for the ground forces, in order to ensure that the fighting power of the front line is brought into full play, its logistics line needs to have the same strength as the front line. The situation is the same in aerial warfare. Judging from foreign examples, it can also be seen from the huge air transport of the same air transport divisions and rear liaison aircraft as the front-line forces.  If the war zone is vast, the necessary amount will increase even more rapidly. It is by no means easy for the enemy America to engage in supply and transport on a 40,000-mile route around the earth. Their ambition is of course hateful, but their efforts must be given considerable respect, even if they are enemies. As the war intensifies, the use of this kind of unit is even more urgent, and we must realize the noisy and chaotic state of affairs like a fire scene. Under certain circumstances, once the strength of the front-line units is advanced, the task of rear supply will be even heavier. The reason for the concern of various countries about transport aircraft lies in this. After all, this unit that is active in the rear is a prerequisite for bringing out the fighting power of the air force.  However, although the records of the combat aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft, and bomber's brave battles are depicted vividly, few people know about the hard work of the transport unit. As a result, the world's perception of aviation is inevitably superficial, which is evidence of a lack of correct understanding of its subtle and organic unity.  Research Institute  The next thing is the research institute. This cannot be underestimated either. From the perspective of the ratio of the aircraft part, it may not be large or unknown, but the necessary research institutes of various countries are, in this era when the technical aspects of various countries are heavily guarded, really huge facilities, and are the absolute amount unrelated to the air force it possesses. Therefore, it is a painful thing for countries with small air force strength to separate a part of their forces for research, but in an era when aviation technology is changing with each passing day, if you only think about today's aviation and not tomorrow's aviation, you will immediately encounter a tragic fate. The enemy America's NACA has hundreds of thousands of personnel, and Germany's VDM has also mobilized hundreds of thousands of technicians. The call to respect technology is definitely not limited to increasing personnel and equipment. The first thing is to absorb the spirit of technology.  Supply Unit  Finally, there is the supply unit, from which the aircraft is transported to domestic and foreign combat units directly facing the enemy (not referring to fighter aircraft). In the process of supply, there is a considerable amount of consumption, which must also be realized. The enemy America departs from the Pacific coast, via Hawaii, Canton Island, and Fiji Island, to the Southwest Pacific, stretching 8,000 kilometers, and its supply is estimated to consume 30%. If it goes around the earth via Africa and India to Chongqing, it is even more difficult. Moreover, this consumption rate is entirely subject to various maritime aviation preparations, so aviation weather, radio communication, and airfield equipment are no less important than the front line.  The aircraft that finally reaches the front-line units in this way are fighting and training at the same time. In the constant dispatch, coupled with intense training other than actual combat, the aircraft is gradually consumed. Just like a piece of ice, even if it is left unused, it will slowly melt. Even without fierce battles, aircraft will be consumed.  What can reduce its consumption rate as much as possible is the repair unit and the repair ability of its own team. Major damage is entrusted to the former, and simple damage is repaired by the team itself. However, due to the convenience of the location and the relationship between repair tools, parts, and materials, sometimes valuable aircraft that are slightly damaged have to be abandoned.  Therefore, all the aircraft of each unit cannot be dispatched at the same time. Only a few percent of them can be dispatched, and this requires careful arrangement of the number of air personnel before they can be dispatched. Sometimes, the aircraft are lined up, but there are no crew members to fly, or the people have been assigned but the aircraft is still being prepared, so not many aircraft are actually dispatched. The enemy American aviation personnel are divided into three shifts for alternate rest. The way to counter this is to improve the design of the equipment and reduce the burden on the crew, and to seriously study aviation medical countermeasures regarding their fatigue.  In this way, it can be seen that the aircraft that are actually active on the front line are only a few percent of the total number coming out of the factory. We should make ten times the effort we are making now to send aircraft to the front line one by one, and at the same time, we should study how to make this pyramid-shaped part effective. Therefore, many problems that have not yet been discussed and many hardships that the world has not paid attention to will soon be brought up as real problems. When we remove the contradictions and unnaturalness in the aviation world, we firmly believe that the fighting power of the aviation will definitely leap forward.</p>
<h3>Congratulations from Various Locations</h3>
<p>Mongolian Border Regions Celebrate Great Victory - Central News Agency, Peiping, 29th: Since the Japanese army annihilated the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Taiwan, the Mengjiang Asia Development Association, in order to express its celebration and promote the determination of officials and people in the decisive battle, specially ordered its branches in various places to uniformly launch celebration rallies on the 24th. - Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th: Various Chinese and Japanese groups in Qingdao, in response to the great victory won by the Japanese army in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, have recently decided to hold a "Week of Arousing Spirit and Destroying the Enemy" from the 30th of this month to the 6th of November. The Commemorative Meeting for the Declaration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration will also be held at this time. - Xinmin Association Passes Resolution of Gratitude - Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th: The annual General Assembly of the North China Xinmin Association was held on the 26th. On the 27th, the entire assembly unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese army for their heroic combat. More than ten people, including Vice Chairman Wang and Chen, Director of the Propaganda Bureau of the Xinmin Association, visited the North China Army and the Peiping Naval Attache Office of Japan on behalf of the General Assembly to present a letter of gratitude. At the same time, they also stated that the representatives attending the General Assembly were determined to complete the heavy responsibilities entrusted to them in North China.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Clarifies Determination to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Manila, 28th - Central News Agency: The great victory won by the Japanese army this time has made the Philippine people's fighting spirit even more vigorous. On the morning of the 27th, President Laurel specially clarified the Filipinos' determination to destroy the enemy as follows: The greater the victory of the Japanese army, the firmer the belief of our Philippine people that the Republic can be preserved. We must deeply recognize that only Japan is the protector of our country's territory, so we express our heartfelt gratitude to the daring of the Japanese army. At the same time, we should take this great victory as an opportunity to strengthen cooperation so that we can complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. The victory of Japan is the victory of the Philippines. We must firmly believe that Japan and the Philippines have an inseparable common relationship. We vow to advance bravely toward our righteous future in this decisive battle and fight for the final victory. - Serious Situation on the American Side - Zurich, 28th - Central News Agency: After the American army landed on Leyte Island, it encountered a fierce counterattack, and a naval and air battle unfolded in the eastern Philippines. The Swiss people are extremely concerned about the announcements made by the Japanese General Headquarters and the war situation in East Asia. According to Domei News Agency, in addition to attacking American warships in Leyte Gulf, the Japanese air force is also very active in other waters. The United States is also broadcasting that the naval and air battle in the Philippines has a decisive nature, calling this war the battle that determines the course of the Pacific operations, and the American people attach great importance to the war situation. The Japanese army first annihilated most of its mobile forces in the sea off Taiwan, so it is feared that the American fleet will have difficulty covering MacArthur's operations in the future.</p>
<h3>The Great Victory of the Japanese Army in the Seas off Taiwan and the Philippines Lays the Foundation for the Inevitable Victory of the War</h3>
<p>Ambassador Tani and President Chou Issue Statements - Ambassador Tani - Nanking, 28th - Central News Agency: The Allied forces severely damaged the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Taiwan and Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, reaping great victories. Mr. Tani Masayuki, the Japanese Ambassador to China, issued a statement on this, saying that after the elite troops of the Japanese army, navy, and air force annihilated and struck the enemy's American mobile forces attacking the sea east of Taiwan, they again engaged and severely damaged the enemy mobile forces attacking the sea east of the Philippines and Leyte Gulf within days, reaping a great victory unprecedented in war. The belief of our 100 million compatriots in the inevitable victory of the war is even more firm. Looking back on the Japanese soldiers, since last year, they have shouldered the belief and heavy responsibility of today's inevitable victory. I express my heartfelt thanks, and at the same time, I pay deep respect to the soldiers who died in the front lines and to my compatriots who have completed the laying of the cornerstone for the construction of Greater East Asia. I am especially pleased that our 100 million people in the rear, especially the residents in China, can deeply understand the government's policies, bury themselves in hard work, and devote all their efforts to their respective posts in order to establish various postures under the decisive battle system. I am convinced that the sincerity of the Japanese people in serving the country is the root of the inevitable victory of Japan, so this great victory should be celebrated even more. At the same time, the sincere cooperation of the Japanese people in the war will be able to exert great power in the future. However, in order to cover up this defeat, the enemy Britain and the United States will attempt to use various schemes to fabricate propaganda and confuse people. At the same time, they will still abandon their ambition to dominate East Asia, but our people already have the belief in inevitable victory and invincibility, which can destroy their attempts, needless to say. I hope that all residents will absolutely trust Japan's inevitable victory in national defense, follow the policies of the authorities, endure all hardships, increase production, and strive to serve the public in order to carry out Japan's inherent traditional spirit. And I deeply hope that all allied nationals residing in Chinese territory will always remember their position as practitioners of the new policy toward China, understand the essence of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, treat people with sincerity, deal with things with morality, and cooperate more closely with Chinese officials and people to strive to complete the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia enterprise. - President Chou - Nanking, 28th - Central News Agency: The Allied navy's defeat of the enemy American navy in the sea east of the Philippines and the achievement of a glorious victory is the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the future of the liberation war jointly undertaken by the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is becoming clearer and clearer. Therefore, the entire nation is enthusiastically celebrating the victory of the Allied navy. President Chou, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, also issued a statement on this yesterday (28th) as follows: The great victory achieved by the Allied navy in fiercely attacking the enemy in the sea east of the Philippines not only caused a major setback to the enemy's counterattack attempt, but also showed the strength of the Japanese army and the consolidation of the defense in the Philippines. Since the enemy America attempted to counterattack, its momentum seemed to have gradually extended westward, but in reality, it only gained one or two isolated islands in the Pacific Ocean, which had absolutely no decisive impact on the overall war situation. Furthermore, judging from the American army's air raid on Taiwan and landing on Leyte Island, it is obvious that they are isolated forces penetrating deep into the enemy's territory. On the contrary, the Japanese army is waiting at leisure and can attack at any time to encircle and annihilate the enemy army, so it is natural that the enemy American army has suffered heavy blows. However, we should sweep away the erroneous idea of blindly worshiping Britain and the United States and believing in the omnipotence of material things, re-recognize the combat strength of the Allied forces, and adhere to the belief in inevitable victory. Do not be arrogant when winning, and do not fall when defeated. The determination of the victory or defeat of the entire world war today does not lie in temporary gains or losses. We must concentrate our total strength with strong determination and indomitable spirit, and then the final victory will surely belong to us. As an Allied nation, in addition to feeling deeply gratified by the great victory of the Japanese army in the sea east of the Philippines and expressing our respect to the soldiers on the front lines, we should also do our best to take on the responsibility of actively strengthening our combat power.</p>
<h3>Details of the Three-Day Naval Battle in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf</h3>
<p>Director of Press Department Kurihara Explains to Foreign Reporters - Tokyo, 28th - Central News Agency: Director of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, Colonel Kurihara Etsuzo, met with a group of foreign reporters on the 27th and explained the details of the naval battle in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf over the three days of the 24th, 25th, and 26th as follows: The Japanese Navy has destroyed Nimitz's right arm in the sea off Taiwan, and now it has thoroughly and severely struck Kingcade's fleet, his left arm, in the sea off the Philippines. The characteristics of this naval battle are, first, the great victory of sinking four aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one destroyer in the decisive battle in the sea east of Tsushima Island on the morning of the 25th, while the Japanese side suffered no damage. The second is the enemy's attack on Leyte Gulf on the 25th. This is indeed a bold and adventurous tactic. In addition to giving the enemy a great blow, as announced by the General Headquarters, the Japanese side also suffered some losses. Colonel Kurihara further pointed out the fact that the enemy sent out rescue telegrams in the sea battle east of Tsushima Island, saying that the content of the telegrams sent by the enemy was: first, [7:20, the Japanese army is attacking, two powerful Japanese units are still attacking], and second, [The Japanese fleet is attacking me, please rescue immediately, attack with high-speed aircraft carriers quickly]. Such important operational telegrams were sent in clear code, and their embarrassment was even worse than at Pearl Harbor. The colonel also said that the losses to the enemy were the sinking of 210,000 tons (the results of the battle in Leyte Gulf are also included in this), and the destruction of 370,000 tons (the results of the battle in Leyte Gulf are not included in this), with a total of 680,000 tons sunk and destroyed. The casualties are estimated to be around 14,300. Then, a reporter asked, [This seems too few], and the colonel replied that the purpose of the Japanese Navy is not only to kill the enemy, this calculation is only a conservative estimate, and the figures in Leyte Gulf and transport ships are not included. In addition, the airmen who shot down enemy planes are naturally not included in this, so in reality, the enemy's losses may be around 40,000. Director Kurihara also spoke about the relationship between carrier-based air units and base-based air units, pointing out that the [principle of aircraft carrier superiority] advocated by the US Navy has been destroyed by the facts. The colonel said that history has proven that the fortress is always the winner in the war between warships and fortresses. In modern warfare, whether from the sea or land, even if airplanes replace artillery shells, the airplanes flying out from the land base are more powerful than carrier-based aircraft in terms of range, mobility, and destructive power and bombing power. Moreover, the land base as a base is more powerful than aircraft carriers. Therefore, it is a reckless strategy for the enemy to attack the Japanese mainland, Taiwan, the Philippines, etc., which have complete large fortresses and large air bases, from the sea with aircraft carriers. It is natural that the enemy has lost a large number of aircraft carriers this time. The enemy will definitely build more aircraft carriers in the future, but the Japanese army will definitely be able to bury them all on the seabed. Later, Colonel Kurihara further pointed out an extremely noteworthy fact, that is, Japanese army aircraft are carrying out sea attacks everywhere, whether in Taiwan or in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval Anniversary Address from Minister Matsushima Amidst Utter Defeat - Broadcast to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Commander Matsushima, China Fleet Press Officer, Broadcasts to the U.S. - Titled "The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the U.S. Off the Eastern Philippines" - On the 27th, the day of the U.S. Navy's anniversary, Minister Matsushima broadcast a mocking address in which he said:</p>
<p>The World Gazes in This Moment</p>
<p>"Today is the anniversary of the U.S. Navy. On this glorious day, I am truly honored to be able to address Admiral Forrestal and the officers and men of the U.S. Navy from across the ocean. First, I would like to report that the U.S. Pacific Fleet has suffered the tragic fate of being nearly annihilated in the ongoing decisive naval battle between Japan and the U.S. off the eastern Philippines. On this day, the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt, the great naval constructor of the United States, the modern U.S. Navy has reached its end due to the disastrous defeat in Leyte Gulf. That is very unfortunate. It is beyond anyone's expectation that the U.S. Navy, which has wasted precious material resources, has a glorious construction history, and maintains a position of boasting to the world, would have such a dismal ending. We can imagine that the eyes and ears of the world are watching this historic moment. However, the magic of American propaganda broadcasts extremely absurd propaganda. According to a Reuters report from Washington on the 27th: [The U.S. Pacific Fleet has destroyed the Japanese fleet in the naval and air battle off the Philippines in the past three days, sinking more than 26 warships, mainly aircraft carriers and battleships.] It also said: [The report is not very complete, and the fighting seems to be continuing, which is clear.] But the losses announced by the United States are extremely small. This proves that their reports are extremely inaccurate. We should note that the figures in the battle results announced by the United States are very different. In this naval battle, the aircraft carriers, battleships, etc. of the U.S. Navy were attacked by our fleet and sent out coded telegrams to friendly forces for help. All U.S. communication agencies probably received them clearly! On this glorious Navy anniversary, there will naturally be no such tragic cries in the victory claimed by the United States. It is gratifying and commendable that the American public is completely unaware of the truth about the battle results of their own fleet, which was built with great effort.</p>
<p>The historic naval battle off the eastern Philippines has come to an end, and the enemy's defeated remnants seem to be fleeing toward the southeast sea. As a result, the enemy's ground forces of about three divisions landing on Leyte Island are completely cut off from their rear, and our elite air units continue to fiercely attack the fleeing and lagging warships and transport convoys in Leyte Gulf without hesitation. According to the announcement of the General Headquarters at 15:00 on the 27th, it is determined that the enemy has suffered an almost annihilating blow. Furthermore, the three divisions of the U.S. Army that are gradually advancing toward a corner of the Philippines are completely different from the situation on Saipan Island. They are being fiercely bombarded and strafed by our air force overhead, and are in a fragmented state. It is truly the dismal end of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Account of the Recent Naval Battle</p>
<p>"Now, I would like to give a brief account of the course of this naval battle based on the information I have obtained. The U.S. military's operational plan was to use MacArthur's forces as the basis for capturing the Philippines, while Nimitz's Pacific Fleet provided overall support at sea.</p>
<p>The enemy's forces were deployed in the north and south. The northern force was commanded by Admiral Halsey and was mainly composed of the Third Fleet. The southern force was commanded by Spruance and had a part of the Third Fleet, plus the Fifth Fleet, the Seventh Fleet, and other Australian naval groups, escorting dozens of transport convoys.</p>
<p>After several meetings, it was revealed that the northern force would first inflict great damage on our air bases in Okinawa and Taiwan, and if possible, lure out our Combined Fleet to inflict a fatal blow, and then the southern force would calmly approach the Philippines and carry out a landing operation. During this period, it was also planned to have the 20th Bomber Group cooperate with the mainland at the appropriate time. However, the northern force's operation suffered a great loss in the previous air battle off Taiwan without much strength from our fleet, and it retreated in a panic. In order to rescue the northern force and achieve cooperation, the southern force was desperately trying to act rashly, but it was caught by our air units east of the Philippines and gradually disappeared. However, the vanguard of the enemy's landing forces took the opportunity to invade Leyte Gulf, and on October 20, they finally occupied a corner of the land. However, our Combined Fleet, which was watching the enemy's movements in a corner of the Pacific, suddenly moved out like lightning. Here, the officers and men of our fleet, who had been waiting eagerly, killed the enemy with even greater emotion and tension than experienced by their predecessors in the Battle of Tsushima. This fleet suddenly appeared in its heroic posture on the 24th. First, it launched a fierce attack on the powerful enemy mobile forces in the sea east of the Philippines from dawn. The submarines and air units that were advancing and retreating nearby cooperated to launch a earth-shattering three-dimensional naval and air battle. At this time, it sank four enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one destroyer. As time went on, battles occurred simultaneously in various places. On the morning of the 25th, the fleet that annihilated the enemy mobile forces in the sea east of the Philippines further突入了 (broke into) Leyte Gulf, where enemy warships and transport convoys were concentrated, from the southern entrance of Leyte Gulf. The [断而行之，鬼神避之] (Decide and act, and even demons will avoid it) legacy of Marshal Togo was glorified without regret, and a sea-to-sea white-blade battle was staged. It also fiercely bombarded the land forces stationed in the Tacloban area, exerting the power of shock tactics. It was truly a magnificent struggle that shocked the heavens and made the ghosts cry, and it inflicted a fatal blow on the enemy. On the 26th, our air units launched fierce raids on the enemy transport convoys and warship groups that were fleeing and lagging behind in the bay. The battle will continue until MacArthur's forces are annihilated. As for the battle results announced today, the number of enemy planes has been greatly reduced. What remains now is to annihilate the three divisions on land. Using this as a trap, we will absorb the enemy's warships here and exert the magic of defeating them one by one, and we will defeat them all in future operations. President Roosevelt will broadcast the following speech from the White House to the Navy on Navy Day, but there is not a single word that specifically mentions this naval battle. Roosevelt said: [Sea power has never been as important as it is today in determining the fate of world history. My navy has been baptized by fire in the most difficult naval battles, but it still shows enormous power. A major chapter in the history of the Pacific naval war remains for us to complete. Undoubtedly, my navy will be able to achieve it.]</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, why hesitate to make a numerical statement on the Philippine naval battle? Most of the officers and men of the U.S. fleet who can hear your statement are lying on glorious beds decorated with coral in the sea near the Philippines, and have become sacrifices for your ambition to dominate the world, the tyranny brought about by the New Deal, and the four-time election of the president. How grateful they should be to spend this year's Christmas at the bottom of the sea! Regarding this point, you should reflect carefully on your cold emotions and the responsibility of your personality. Don't be surprised, since the air battle in the Taiwan waters on the 12th, the U.S. warships sunk and destroyed have reached as many as 193, including 39 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, and 19 cruisers. No matter how much you try to embellish it, the truth about this loss of the U.S. Navy will soon be exposed. In the meantime, the personnel losses, calculated as 50% for sinking and 20% for destruction, have reached 58,600. The cumulative total since the Battle of Saipan is at least 150,000 dead, and the total number of casualties is no less than 500,000.</p>
<p>A Page of Tragic History</p>
<p>"Philippine naval battle, Philippine naval battle! Our Combined Fleet, which had been lying dormant for two years, suddenly rose up and slaughtered more than 100 enemy American warships. Alas, how fierce, how tragic! But looking back on the past of the Pacific war, what a long and painful history of our forbearance! In the past, our soldiers defending Kwajalein and Roi-Namur died in battle, their voices hoarse and their tears dry, shouting [Not enough planes! Planes, planes!]. In the past, our compatriots on Saipan, even women with high hair, also drank their hatred in an isolated and undisturbed island and embraced each other and died in the sea. Who of our warriors and compatriots in our country who heard these sad reports did not have their hair stand on end in anger? But, even though help was not available, how was our grief and anger? Eating cold water in cold weather, every bit is in my heart. The thought of avenging this hatred someday is deeply engraved on the hearts and minds of our 100 million compatriots. For the enemy American fleet that rampages in the Pacific by relying on material resources, our Combined Fleet has shouldered the national will of our people, and is determined to give it a thorough blow. As soon as the time comes, we will cut it in two with one knife and cut off its arrogant bones. The whole army eagerly awaited the arrival of the divine opportunity, and the divine opportunity finally came. Enduring wind and rain, after two years of research, our Combined Fleet, which has become strong to the extreme, appeared as quickly as a hurricane, caught the enemy fleet in a corner of the coast of the Philippines, and chopped off the heads of the stubborn and unruly with a quick knife, letting it spew out the rotten poisonous juice that disturbs the world. And the 27th, when the General Headquarters announced this decisive battle result of the Philippine naval battle, which will forever be immortal in the history of the world, happened to be the U.S. Navy anniversary, which is truly a coincidence! Alas, the proud will not last long! Our Japanese nation, which has been enduring hardship and struggling until now for the sacred war of liberating the nations of Greater East Asia, although it has fewer material resources than the enemy, has a wise eye and has given us today's victory. This victory is precisely the victory that has been exchanged for the blood and sweat of the unity and effort of the military and civilians. Who is drunk with this victory? Who is lost in this victory? From this day on, we will lie on firewood and taste gall again, and fight resolutely until the day when the enemy America finally kneels down! In this way, the declaration of the nations of Greater East Asia will be realized. China, Manchuria, the Philippines, and even the nations of Thailand, Burma, and Indonesia, in this breeze where the night is fading, hand in hand, regardless of blood, will rise up in the blood sacrifice of the Philippine waters. That pitiful Eastern traitor, Chongqing, should also abandon all black market transactions today and return to the Greater East Asia standard. If you miss today, there will be no second chance. Our 100 million people will never be proud of the results of this decisive battle. Under this decisive victory, we will take a new step toward building Greater East Asia, and at the same time, we will seek more enthusiastic and active cooperation from the 1 billion compatriots of East Asia.

<h3>City Economic Bureau Strives to Suppress and Stabilize Prices, Determined to Investigate Hoarding and Curb Artificial Price Increases</h3>
<p>The City Economic Bureau held a tea party yesterday (28th) to report on the bureau's price control efforts, inviting reporters from local Chinese and foreign newspapers. Also present were Wu Songnie, representative of Mayor Chen, Wudao, Director of the Economic Security Office, Pan Bide, Secretary of the City Propaganda Department, and Advisor Ijichi. Director of the Economic Bureau Xu Tianshen first reported and strongly declared the authorities' determination to suppress and stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Xu Bureau Chief's Address:</p>
<p>[Two weeks ago, I summarized the high prices in the city and spoke about it several times. Regarding the fundamental solutions, I am working with the central government on overall planning and active implementation. Today, I want to report on the emergency measures being taken to suppress and stabilize prices. The price of goods in this city has now reached its peak. There are many reasons for this, but the hoarding and manipulation by profiteers and arbitrary price increases are important factors. For example, warehouses are full of goods, but they are unwilling to sell them adequately, only wanting to wait for a higher price. The sources of pork, beef, chicken, duck, vegetables, and local goods are not lacking, and may even be more abundant than before. Why are they so expensive? Obviously, it is due to manipulation and arbitrary price increases. Today, as the Greater East Asia War reaches its decisive stage, the people in the rear must save on consumption, increase production, stabilize prices in the rear, and consolidate the rear economy, which is the responsibility of everyone. If prices are allowed to rise uncontrollably, it will affect the morale of the front lines, not to mention the livelihood of the entire nation. Therefore, after long preparation and consideration, we have decided to launch economic police forces from today to conduct a comprehensive inspection. This inspection will be carried out in two aspects: one is to investigate warehouses and storage facilities, and the other is to investigate illegal price increases of various daily necessities. The investigation methods for warehouses and storage facilities, as well as the official price list for daily necessities, have been published in the newspapers. Our investigation targets all public and private inventories, and we will simultaneously investigate both Chinese and Western businesses, ensuring that the price increase trend is completely curbed to ensure people's livelihood and consolidate the rear economy. This is the greatest determination of our bureau.]</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Speech:</p>
<p>[If the price problem cannot be solved, many problems cannot be solved. The high prices make life difficult for the general public, especially those on salaries, who cannot maintain their personal lives. The city government, the Economic Bureau, the Economic Security Office, and all parties concerned have discussed solutions to the serious price problem several times. After research by all parties, two main reasons were identified: first, natural causes, and second, artificial causes. The former is due to wartime transportation difficulties, inconvenience of transportation, and reduced supply of materials, etc. The latter is caused by unscrupulous merchants and profiteers hoarding and manipulating prices. The authorities will naturally use various methods to eliminate the natural causes. The artificial causes are a special problem in Shanghai. If the artificial causes cannot be removed, the price problem cannot be solved. Therefore, after repeated discussions by the competent authorities and all parties concerned, it was decided to conduct a general inspection from the 27th of this month to sanction unscrupulous merchants who attempt to make illegal profits, hoping to remove the artificial causes. Although this may not be a very effective method, it is something the authorities must do. It is hoped that the competent authorities will work hard in carrying out this economic inspection, and it is also hoped that the media will provide more assistance so that the price problem in Shanghai can be successfully started to be resolved.]</p>

<h3>Major Victory of Japanese Forces in Taiwan and the Philippines, Secretary-General Wu's Remarks on the Complete Crushing of Enemy's American Counteroffensive Attempt</h3>
<p>Following the naval air battle off the coast of Taiwan, the Japanese forces have achieved unprecedented victories in air battles off the coast of Leyte Island in the Philippines and in the sea east of the island. The good news has been received with great excitement by the Chinese and Japanese people here. In this regard, City Government Secretary-General Wu Songbie made the following remarks: We are deeply grateful for the great victories achieved by our ally Japan. All Chinese people share this feeling, which goes without saying. The enemy America, relying on its large material resources, attempted a general counteroffensive and made boastful and arrogant propaganda. This time, it will suffer a heavy blow, and its counteroffensive attempt has been crushed by the Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Mobile Residence Certificates Application Strictly Prohibits Extortion and Obstruction, Residents are Encouraged to Report Any Abuses</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that residents deeply understand the procedures for issuing mobile residence certificate application forms in various districts, the head of the Police Bureau Baojia Office, Gu Jiwu, gave a statement to reporters yesterday. Regarding the mobile residence certificate application forms, they have always been distributed by this office to the Baojia shares of the police sub-bureaus in various districts for residents to obtain as needed. However, recently, a small number of residents in some districts have expressed great distress and annoyance about this. This office must make the following statement: There is no charge for obtaining mobile residence certificate application forms. When residents submit the completed forms for processing, the handling fees are also regulated. The handling fee for mobile residence, birth, death, and other matters is five yuan. The handling fee for reissuing a lost residence certificate is ten yuan. Receipts are issued for all of these fees. All income from the Baojia administration is submitted by the sub-bureaus to the bureau and then to the city government each month. This office is in a supervisory and guiding position. In short, the handling fees for residence certificates and mobile certificates have long been established, and since the beginning of implementation, extortion and abuses have been strictly prohibited. However, recently, due to budget constraints, there have been some delays in the printing of the forms needed by this office. In order to meet the urgent needs of residents, this office is making every effort to seek quick remedies and has been distributing the forms needed by the police sub-bureaus in general from September. The General Affairs Office of this bureau is still being urged to print additional forms as soon as possible for the sub-bureaus to collect. However, the Xujiawan district has not yet reported the consumption of paper, and it is assumed that there is still some paper left. All other districts have collected the forms in succession since September, and this office will continue to issue them according to their needs. Therefore, it should not be difficult for residents in various districts to obtain application forms from the bureaus. If any obstruction or extortion is discovered, residents are urged not to be swayed by sentiment and to bravely report it to this office. If there are any concerns, reports can be made anonymously in writing. Do not be easily deceived. If the facts are verified, this office will strictly investigate.</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign Focuses on Automobile Driving</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Traffic Safety Week organized by the City Police Bureau.

<h3>Record of a Bloody Battle of Japanese Patrol Boat</h3>
<p>On the vast Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>The specially equipped patrol boats, cruising the vast Pacific Ocean to prevent enemy attacks from the sea and air, are the tentacles active on the front line of defending the Japanese homeland. They are just small boats weighing only a hundred tons. In that boundless ocean, they are really a grain of sand in the sea. Their armament is also very weak. Whenever they encounter a strong enemy and fight until they are exhausted, the hardship of the crew is beyond description. One day, a specially equipped patrol boat encountered a new American large submarine hundreds of miles east of Japan. After three hours of bloody battle, it was severely injured and escaped. The following is a record of the sea battle described by a certain captain of the patrol boat.</p>
<p>On a certain day in August, the wind was calm and the sea was clear. It was very hot from the morning. At 8:10, a large submarine suddenly surfaced on the sea four thousand meters to the left. It was the latest American large submarine, probably over two thousand tons. It seemed to despise us and immediately took an offensive stance against us.</p>
<p>Enemy Boat Surfaces</p>
<p>"Enemy submarine surfaced, intends to attack." While sending the telegram to the base, we also ordered full speed ahead to charge towards the submarine. The distance between us instantly narrowed to three thousand meters. We, with the principle of striking first, immediately opened fire with cannons and machine guns. They were shocked and hurriedly submerged. Did they escape? Of course, we would not let them escape easily. We immediately sped to the surface of the water where it sank and launched a depth charge attack. It probably went deep into the sea. We bombarded the water for a while and saw no movement, so we continued sailing, looking for friendly boats to deal with the enemy submarine that was sure to surface again.</p>
<p>The monotonous sound of the engine rumbled on. It was already 10:10. We had not yet met any friendly boats. At this time, at one hundred and twenty degrees to the right, three thousand meters away, the American submarine surfaced again. It was escaping at full speed. We immediately chased after it, but we were not as fast as it, and the distance gradually increased, about four thousand meters apart. At this moment, the enemy suddenly mobilized twelve-inch twin-mounted guns, eight-inch guns, twin-mounted twenty-millimeter machine guns, and seven-point-seven-centimeter machine guns and launched a fierce attack. As a result, pillars of water surged around us, and foam and splashes of water flew together, like a rainstorm. More and more shells fell nearby. We braved the rain of bullets and advanced at full speed. The distance was reduced to three thousand meters. Our boat then spread a smokescreen while firing and continued to advance. The distance became shorter and shorter, from two thousand meters to one thousand meters. We were prepared to ram it with the boat and exert our last strength to advance rapidly. At this time, the enemy boat, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately stopped the attack and turned to escape. Its speed could reach twenty-five knots per hour, much faster than us. Soon, it was four thousand meters away. After they got out of our firing range, they immediately took the offensive.</p>
<p>At this moment, our boat's gunners and machine gunners were killed and wounded one after another, and the deck was covered in blood. Suddenly, an enemy shell hit the mast. A soldier with a severe injury to his right wrist saw that the flag was about to fall, struggled to get up, and ran to the bridge under a hail of machine-gun bullets and raised the flag with one hand. Our boat's combat power gradually weakened in the fierce battle, but our morale rose in inverse proportion. Not long after, after we sent a telegram to dispose of classified documents, the telegraph machine was also destroyed, so we lost the means of contact with the base. Because we did not have enough speed, it was practically impossible to ram it and perish together, so we had to grit our teeth and do our best to inflict damage on the enemy boat. Unfortunately, our guns were also damaged one after another. They arrogantly treated us like a toy. We were angry, but we could not do anything to them.</p>
<p>Hit Enemy Boat</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the enemy's carelessness, we tried our best to get closer and finally approached within a thousand meters. The American submarine was thus greatly embarrassed and hurriedly launched two torpedoes from the stern torpedo tubes and tried to escape. We continued to advance and approached within three hundred meters. We fired a sure-hit shell. Two shells hit the submarine's command tower one after another. Seeing the enemy soldiers fleeing in the hazy smoke, we finally got rid of the bad air we had suffered just now. When the smoke cleared, the eight-inch gun on top of the submarine was bent like toffee. At this time, the shells fired by our boat hit the deck between the submarine turret and the command tower, opening a large hole. The enemy soldiers were in chaos and in a mess. In this way, the submarine could no longer dive, but our losses were also not small. The shells had been used up, and the lifeboats were also damaged by the shells. The only weapons that could still be used were four rifles. We drew our knives and were all prepared to commit suicide after the patrol boat sank. At this time, the enemy's shells also seemed to have been used up. The twelve-inch guns and machine guns were all silent. The enemy soldiers were waving machine guns while hurriedly repairing the deck.</p>
<p>"Catch it!" We shouted loudly, straightened the cloth wrapped around our heads, and prepared for hand-to-hand combat. They hurriedly dropped the mines they were laying and fled at full speed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because our boat was not fast, we finally let that submarine escape. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 24)</p>
<h3>The Decisive Battle of Science</h3>
<p>——Mobilization of Technology in Various Countries—— The situation of the war, characterized by a battle of quantity and a battle of science, is becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, the mobilization of scientists and technicians has become a decisive factor for victory. The warring countries are now desperately concentrating the minds of scientists to explore how to maximize their effectiveness and turn them into combat power. In Japan, various measures to mobilize scientists are gradually getting on track. Recently, the government announced an imperial ordinance on the mobilization of skilled workers to increase aircraft production. The Academic Research Council has also made suggestions to various parties on how to better integrate research with combat and production. The following is a brief overview of the scientific and technological mobilization efforts of the major warring countries:</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Under the absolute command of Marshal Göring, Director of the Four-Year Plan Bureau, he is responsible for all planning and mobilization. Scientific mobilization was also implemented in 1942 based on the Führer's order on the Aviation Research Management Law. Aviation science became the focus of mobilization, with the Academy of Sciences taking the lead. Later, when Speer became Minister of Armaments, the command of the research institute and the authority to mobilize scientists for wartime production were transferred to Speer. A committee chaired by Speer, with representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as leaders of munitions factories, has recently been reorganized to ensure close cooperation between the front lines and the research institutes. This has led to the successive production of new weapons such as the V1 unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Soviet research institutions are directly subordinate to the Academy of Sciences and various People's Committees. The main tasks are: the Academy of Sciences engages in basic research, while the committees' institutions focus on applied research. There is also a comprehensive organization to turn these efforts into combat power, serving as a medium for research, adoption, decision-making, and production, with very strong control.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Shortly after the outbreak of war between Germany and Britain in June 1940, the United States began wartime mobilization of technology, organizing the National Defense Research Committee (NDRA). The government appointed various ministers as members, directly under the National Defense Council. This was an organization centered on official and civilian scientists, with Harvard University President Conant as chairman, who engaged in the wartime organization of scientists after taking office. Subsequently, as the war in Europe progressed, this organization was no longer sufficient. Soon, the Emergency Management Office (OEM), the highest advisory body to the President, absorbed the National Defense Research Committee. Members were appointed by representatives of the Army and Navy. Army General Richard Moore and Navy Rear Admiral Pyle also participated in the meeting, implementing close operational coordination and substantively enriching the content. At the same time, the highest command of wartime scientific and technological mobilization in the United States was established.</p>
<p>The following year, to strengthen the control of research, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was established under the Emergency Management Office, the research administrative agency with executive power. The Production Research and Development Board (CPRD) was re-established the year before last. This completed and strengthened the comprehensive implementation of guidance administration from research to production. (Dezhong)</p>
<h3>Fighting Spirit of the Warriors of Peleliu Island</h3>
<p>On Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, the Japanese army still secures the airfield. During the day, they hide in their positions and endure, and at night, they send out close-quarters assault squads to infiltrate the enemy's positions and inflict damage, continuing their tenacious defense. On that lush island, full of red hibiscus flowers, the corpses of American soldiers will soon form a landscape. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese Army and Navy will fight bravely until the very end.</p>
<p>I spent some time on Koror Island in the Palau Islands between the spring and summer of this year. From that time on, the Palau Islands were the focus of enemy attention. Since the U.S. task force launched a strong attack at the end of March, Palau has been an important frontline base and has been very active during the Mariana Islands naval and air battle in June. Since then, the enemy has regarded the Palau Islands as a thorn in their side and has harassed them every day. Their advance to Biak Island and other bases in northwestern New Guinea was both in preparation for the Philippines operation and to create a foothold for attacking the Palau Islands. As for their choice of Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands as a landing site, it was because the island had an airfield. If they could seize the island, it could be used as an air base for attacking the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Palau Islands are a string of beautiful coral islands, different from Saipan. They are a group of islands with many small islands and harbors. Koror Island is the center, with Palau Island across the waterway to the north and Peleliu Island to the south. It takes about three hours to reach Peleliu Island from Koror Island by large motorboat. Peleliu Island is a low island typical of coral reefs. The island produces almost nothing, but it is an important aviation base in the South Seas.</p>
<p>After the Battle of the Mariana Islands, the enemy's intention to attack the Philippines became very clear. Therefore, Palau, located next to Mindanao Island in the Philippines, was bound to bear the brunt. This was expected early on. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the Army and Navy defending the island were full of spirit and boiling with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm to overwhelm the enemy</p>
<p>"Even if it's just one person, we'll have to take down several enemy soldiers. That's my only thought." When I left the island, a naval officer told me this at parting.</p>
<p>"They will definitely come to attack Peleliu. The blood debt from Saipan will definitely be settled by us!" A soldier stationed on Peleliu Island, whom I knew well, said passionately.</p>
<p>"The people on Saipan did so well, we have to do as well as them!" A Japanese expatriate who remained on the island to assist the military assured me resolutely.</p>
<p>I understood very well how strong the spirit of the soldiers and civilians on the island was to destroy the enemy. Moreover, even in such a tense atmosphere, the soldiers remained calm. During my stay on the island, I never heard them say a word about honorable death or dying in battle. They only wanted to destroy the enemy soldiers, and each person wanted to kill several. However, although they were full of killing intent, they still whistled and sang songs leisurely in their spare time, and engaged in planting yams and pumpkins. I thought of those soldiers who had long anticipated this situation and were working leisurely in the fields, and I understood very well why they were preparing to repel the landing enemy forces, fully expressing the killing intent to wipe out the enemy forces deep in their hearts. They will definitely fight as fiercely as demons! (Kawano Reporting Team Member) (Translated from the September 24th issue of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Map of the Situation Near the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>The enemy U.S. fleet lurking in the sea east of the Philippines has been almost completely destroyed by relentless attacks by the Japanese Navy and Air Force in recent days. Enemy ships and landing forces in Leyte Gulf have also been reduced to the point of annihilation. The Japanese army is seizing control of the sea and air and continuing the pursuit. Shirakaba</p>
<h3>Under the Moon</h3>
<p>— Sang Shen</p>
<p>Tonight, the moon is full, I linger, unable to bear to look; Human feelings are understood as cold, worldly affairs taste bitter and sour; My family is ruined, I am a guest in a foreign land, secretly worried about having no rice to eat; The rivers and mountains are vast and empty, tears fall across the railing. Tonight, the moonlight is like water, permeating my entire small house, as well as the bookshelves, tables, chairs, and bed inside the house... That bone-chilling coldness touched my face; mouth, eyes, nose... dispelling my dreams and fatigue, I suddenly jumped out of bed, pushed open the window lattice, and stepped on the moonlight on the balcony. I leaned on the railing nonchalantly, gazing, gazing; savoring the current night scene, I forgot about time and space, and even the existence of "I."</p>
<p>Silently, I don't know how long I was like this, when I was suddenly attacked by a wave of melancholy, which was mixed with the troubles of the world during the day, and the oppression of life: etc. I didn't even know the tastes of bitterness, spiciness, sourness, and sweetness. I only felt that the wave of emotion rose from the bottom of my heart, rising—I really had no power to suppress it, so I just wanted to vent it. I wrote a poem like the one above, but after reciting it again, I felt that the poem was extremely rough and shallow, and I wanted to tear it up; but at the same time, I thought, it could still reveal some of my current state of mind, so I treasured it and hid it in a diary that I always carried with me.</p>
<p>It must have been late at night, the moon hanging in the mid-sky like a polished little silver coin, pouring out a dim and desolate taste. Under the moonlight, dark shadows flickered, conjuring up tigers, leopards, bears, lions, demons: etc., weaving a gloomy and terrifying world, shrouded in darkness and loneliness. This was something that didn't exist during the day, and in contrast to the daytime's hustle and bustle, noise, heat, and tension, it became another world. But those who were tired of the daytime's complexity and arrogance would rather accept the night's tranquility and loneliness, even though the night was dark and terrifying.</p>
<p>Even those who have the generous and heroic spirit of [Flying Cups to the Moon] by the river, or even the solitude of [Raising a cup to invite the bright moon, facing my shadow, we become three people], would not feel interested. Is it that age has buried my passion? No. Is it that my temporary mood is infected with loneliness? No. What is it? I really don't even know myself! The gentle moonlight is loved by everyone, especially by lovers, who have a special fondness for it, even to the point of becoming thin and tempting. But the moonlight's inspiration aroused in me a wave of melancholy, or even indignation—that was due to the turmoil of the times, and the anxiety about how to spend a series of "tomorrows" in the face of the world's hardships.</p>
<p>I'm not yet thirty, but I'm really on the verge of thirty. The ancients said, [At thirty, one should stand firm], but I have never had a good impression of [standing firm], and I even hate it. [Stand firm on what?] I often sigh like this, or even mock it. In this day and age, talking about life is not about [living], but about suffering, torment, and dying quickly; taking me as an example: how can a little bit of dead salary withstand the crazy, daily-increasing prices? The two words [salary] and [water] really have the meaning of [a cup of water] and [a cartload of firewood], making it impossible for people to think that they can be of any help. Therefore, even my income from working alone is difficult to make ends meet, let alone supporting a family of four? The only solutions at the moment are pawning and borrowing. But pawning has its limits, and borrowing has the risk of being rejected. These are only temporary remedies, and cannot be expected to last forever. When I'm really broke, or when there are so few visitors that "birds can be caught in the net," then I can only die to end my life. I'm not deliberately saying this in such a painful way. There's really no other way. So I'm always worried about this tomorrow!</p>
<p>Now, this house, which is permeated by moonlight, used to have many guests every night, although I dare not say: [The seats are always full of guests, and the wine in the jug is never empty]. But at least a few close friends would come to gather every time—their faces would naturally be illuminated by the moon until they were very familiar. But in recent years, the number of times my friends come has decreased in inverse proportion to the rise in the price index. As of now, apart from my wife and children, I really don't see another person. So I live alone, separated from the group. What is the reason for this? Perhaps someone will ask me this, or perhaps the moon that knows their faces so well will be surprised by their absence and ask me. My answer is very simple: isn't it because of poverty? In recent years, due to the hardships of life, I have had to brazenly borrow money from my friends, one, two... once, twice... so my friends have become disgusted with me, and their feet walk towards other people's homes. Occasionally, when we meet on the road, I can see them avoiding me from afar. Or sometimes, when we bump into each other, we can't talk for more than a few words before they half-escape and half-run away. I understand that they're afraid I'll bring up money again. Money, money, money, life, life, life, so I am humiliated, avoided, and abandoned in a corner of society. The whole world has forgotten me, the whole crowd has forgotten me. There's really no way, what else is there to say!</p>
<p>Therefore, I also doubt my own ability to deal with the world. What is it about myself that is inferior to others? Isn't it the stubbornness left behind by my parents, aloof and arrogant, unwilling to bow my head to others in everything; unwilling to scheme, flatter, and disdaining speculation and windfall gains, and even less willing to be a two-faced person who [begs for pity at night and is arrogant during the day], to the point of being penniless now. I am ridiculed by the current society and have become a big fool in the current society! The current society is a world of money, a society of vanity. Whoever has more money has more ability, a higher status, and receives more respect and honor. But I don't have this ability to make money, what can I do?</p>
<p>Looking back at my wife and children's sound sleep under the moonlight, it is peaceful and sweet. I can't bear to think, and I think so, too, that they are all innocent, but they have encountered an unfortunate life of turmoil and poverty. This responsibility, of course, falls on the shoulders of me, the husband and the father. But in the vast night, in the vast world, where can I find a way out? To open a door to a happy and peaceful life for myself and my wife and children?</p>
<p>The moon has moved westward, casting a white light on the window curtain. The atmosphere of the night is even deeper and more terrifying. It's time for me to go back to my room, but I'm still a little reluctant; suddenly, a hand touched the railing, but felt a cold and wet sensation. It must be raindrops or dew, but there are no clouds in the sky, and the stars are twinkling. So I was surprised to realize that it was my tears, flowing out of my eyes. I lowered my head, cupped my face, and quietly returned to my room, leaving the moon hanging in the western sky, silent, silent...</p>
<h3>Dealing with the World</h3>
<p>— Bud</p>
<p>Take other people's experiences as your own, and don't repeat their mistakes. Good things should be thought of in a good way, and bad things must be looked at from a bad perspective.</p>
<p>Prepare for a future in your own mind, and constantly compare your current self with your future self. In this way, you can see the difference between them. If you can eliminate this difference, it will be a clear sign that your ideals have become a reality.</p>
<p>Try to create an orderly life, because if you want to develop, you must first have a serious life. It is better to accumulate a penny from hardship than to obtain millions of gold through speculation, because money earned from hardship will not be misused, and money from speculation will ultimately be difficult to keep for long.</p>
<p>Don't tell people everything you think in your heart. The tone of your voice should be low and pleasant to the ear. Often, how you say something is more important than what you say.</p>
<p>Don't easily promise other people's requests, but once you agree, you must faithfully keep your promise, regardless of how much sacrifice it entails.</p>
<p>Regardless of who did the work, praise good results unreservedly. If criticism is needed, criticize deliberately to give people real benefits, and never show a contemptuous attitude.</p>
<p>Always be happy, put away your pain, and hide your worries and disappointments under a smile.</p>
<h3>Magpie and Crow</h3>
<p>— Yang Shinian</p>
<p>...In the southeast corner of my house, there is a very tall and large ginkgo tree. Judging by its trunk, which is so large that four or five people cannot embrace it, it can be known that it must be an old antique from several hundred years ago. As the years go by, the branches and trees become more and more lush, giving it a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. Not to mention timid friends who will have a [suspicious] mentality towards it, even ordinary people are somewhat afraid to approach it because of its imposing size.</p>
<p>...Originally, such a place under lush green trees could be greatly utilized. If a circle of chairs were placed around it, old, young, male, and female could all sit and chat for a while, talking about [Classic of Mountains and Seas], while letting the gusts of breeze carry away the day's hard work. In a rural area without the enjoyment of a modern city, this could be considered a good place to rest. However, due to the villagers' avoidance of it over the years, its surroundings have become a wilderness that no one visits, and the lush branches and leaves have become the habitat of crows and magpies.</p>
<p>...Every day at dawn, before it is fully light, I am awakened by the long cries of crows, but I often refuse to get up. I use the clearest mind in the morning to start thinking about everything. I think about the teachers' stern faces in school, and I think about the sweet hopes for the future. Such wild thoughts continue until a flock of magpies make a noisy sound on my roof, and then I think it's time to get up. Then I wash, have breakfast, and go to school. I am never late, and I am never so early that the school gate is not even open. As long as it rains, the crows and magpies invisibly become my two clocks. When I recall my childhood life in my hometown, I can never forget their loyal service to me for many years. Indeed, I should thank them for giving me so many benefits.</p>
<p>...Is it people's selfish mentality, or an unreasonable prejudice, that always says that crows are bad and magpies are a symbol of happiness? I don't know when this legend originated, and I don't know what mysterious principles are hidden in it, saying that people's happiness is related to birds. Although I have asked older generations who know more than I do, they are just taking it lightly and repeating the rumors like everyone else, and can't explain why. If we talk about their appearance, the general black body, and if we talk about their voices, then the crows' melancholy long cries are certainly not inferior to the magpies' [chirp, chirp] noisy sounds. However, the strange thing is that this unfounded hypothesis can be firmly rooted in the hearts of every countryman and remain unchanged for a long time. I remember that one year, when my father was seriously ill, and this was also told to me by my family afterwards, they said that on that day, many crows gathered on the roof of my house and cried [caw, caw] incessantly. Then my father passed away on that day. Even if the crows could indeed foresee my father's death, then what kind of happiness did those magpies, who constantly flew back and forth in front of my house every day, give me? I don't feel unhappy when I hear the crows' loud cries, and I don't feel overly happy when I hear one or two magpies' low chirps. I just treat them as my natural friends. Indeed, they can break the silence in the remote countryside.</p>
<p>...But as I get older, I no longer have the childlike heart of my childhood. Someone said, [When people reach middle age, they have more worries]. Although I don't have any [amazing] sorrows or any big stimuli, I can't have the same leisure and interest as before. I can no longer hear the crows' and magpies' uneven cries and feel that this is a call from nature, arousing a knowing resonance in my heart. My mind no longer has a stream of inspiration, but is full of the scars of life's urging. I began to curse them for waking me up from my good dreams. They would not let go of these few opportunities for me to catch my breath, and let the burden of life continue to weigh heavily on my shoulders day by day.</p>
<p>...Leaving my hometown, I have unknowingly been away for nearly ten years. In this city, I can't see such tall trees or hear the cries of crows and magpies, which makes the traveler in a foreign land can't help but long for the past. I don't know if the ginkgo tree with its lush branches and leaves is more shady than before, and whether the crows and magpies, who have been separated from me for ten years, are still breaking everyone's dreams in the quiet morning.</p>

<h3>Commentary on Two Exciting Group A Matches in the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>The Shenbao Cup basketball tournament has unfolded in unprecedented grandeur over the past week, especially the match between the Petroleum Team and Zhongbei on Friday, which attracted more attention than expected. Not only were tickets sold out before 6:00 PM, but fans of all kinds stood outside the gate until the end of the match, lingering and unwilling to leave. The authorities deeply apologized for the venue's failure to accommodate a large number of spectators. The following is a record of all the Group A matches of the past week, and comments on the two most noteworthy matches:</p>
<p>Group A Match Results for the Past Week</p>
<p>23rd (Monday) Mingxing won against V Team 30-23 Zhongbei won against Huanan 41-31</p>
<p>25th (Wednesday) Hualian won against Tongren 64-25 Huanan won against Dahua 46-40</p>
<p>27th (Friday) Mingxing won against Renyu 24-21 Petroleum Team won against Zhongbei 45-33</p>
<p>Among the above matches, the most significant ones were Huanan's victory over Dahua and Petroleum Team's victory over Zhongbei, which brought a change in atmosphere to the basketball world. There are rising stars, and the old and weak are being eliminated, which is a good phenomenon. It also makes people understand that in the basketball stage, purely relying on skills without sufficient average stamina is difficult to achieve anything. Let's discuss the disastrous defeat of Dahua against Huanan:</p>
<p>Dahua's Stamina is Inferior and Their Tactics are Flawed</p>
<p>The players of Dahua are mostly well-known figures in the basketball world, such as Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, and Chen Xianglong. However, as they get older, they inevitably have a sense of waning beauty. The team's tactics are man-to-man marking. To use man-to-man marking effectively, sufficient stamina is essential. Players like Lu and Chen can only maintain the situation in the first half at most. Therefore, when a flaw is seen in the second half, a rotation should be used to replace players, so as to block the opponent. At the very least, realizing that their strength is insufficient, they should find a way to switch to zone defense to save energy. Although not the best strategy, it is necessary. Huanan's victory over Dahua was due to their stamina and spirit. Their progress is commendable. However, their tactics are still lacking. After the opponent used man-to-man marking, they only relied on uncertain long shots, especially He Jingui being marked tightly by Zhang Banglun. This is Banglun's success, but also a point where Huanan has not yet succeeded. To break man-to-man marking, speed should be used to change the blocking. He Jingui should not be allowed to simply run around looking for openings. Is this sufficient? It is hoped that the team's coach, Zhang Le, will study further and guide them to the best of their ability, so that Huanan's future will have unlimited glory.</p>
<h3>Petroleum Team's Attacks are Fast and Their Shooting is Remarkably Accurate</h3>
<p>Petroleum Team's victory over Zhongbei was by no means a fluke, based on the entire game. Seeing Zhongbei's unfamiliarity, Petroleum Team adopted a fast-paced attack from the start. Zhongbei was unprepared and quickly conceded points, which laid the foundation for the victory. If Petroleum Team had focused on a steady and solid approach, they would not have had such gains at the start, and would not have been able to ultimately win. Zhongbei's skills are not bad, and their endurance is also acceptable. The most significant reason for their failure was their unfamiliarity. Shen Yugong, on whom they relied to score, only scored one goal. This was due to a lack of practice. Otherwise, if Yugong could shoot with great accuracy, hitting seven or eight out of ten shots, then the outcome would have been difficult to predict. Petroleum Team has been trained through hard work, and this harvest is enough to comfort them. The author hopes that they will not be arrogant in victory, continue to work hard, and seek further improvement.</p>
<h3>The Clash of Titans: Wah Luen vs. Wah Nam Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>Among this week's Division A schedule, the Wah Luen vs. Wah Nam match tomorrow night is the most anticipated by fans. The prediction favors Wah Luen for victory. However, the latter, fresh from their victory over Ta Hua, will undoubtedly make improvements for this match. It is hoped that Wah Nam understands how to utilize Ho Kam-kwai, and does not underestimate him or neglect him, for that will lead to greater success.</p>
<h3>The Key to League Friendship: A Discussion of the Battle with the Portuguese Merchants</h3>
<p>— Mei Kit</p>
<p>Friendship Athletic Association has reorganized and refreshed its lineup this season, with the addition of the young player Lo Sau-fuk, earning them newfound respect from fans. Today, as they meet the Portuguese Merchants Club in the league, I have high hopes for Friendship Athletic Association, so I offer this brief commentary. The two teams met in the second Welfare Competition, where Friendship Athletic Association won four to two, but this cannot be taken as a definitive result. The previous match for the Portuguese Merchants was their first of the season, and inevitably showed signs of an "early-season slump." Now, after several matches, they are more refined, and Friendship Athletic Association should understand the most important keys to offense and defense. Break the Connection Between So Yok-kao and Sze Tan Often, you can see V. So engrossed in dribbling, while Sze Tan strives to find an opening. When V. So is dribbling, in addition to one person trying to stop him, another should tightly mark Sze Tan. Otherwise, it is extremely dangerous if he finds an opening. Friendship Athletic Association must find a way to thoroughly sever this connection. Secondly, Ku Wing-fuk must tightly mark the active Fuk Wan on the right wing, and must not relax. This person is very effective if given the opportunity, and Afuk should be careful. Lo and Ki-lun Should Pass Closely The Portuguese Merchants' defense, apart from Oliveira, who is indeed intelligent and courageous, has A. Kola Sha as a right midfielder, who relies solely on brute force. Therefore, Lo and Ki-lun should pass closely, and escape this player, in order to have hope of penetrating deep into enemy territory and succeeding. Also, I understand that Ko Bo-cheng has returned to Shanghai and will fill the right wing position, which is ideal. Bo-cheng has speed, so let him sprint, and Victor Taylor and Greenberg will be helpless. This will create opportunities for the unpredictable Hui Man-kwai to find openings, and I believe Ah-kwai will have better shots today.</p>
<h3>The Wah Nam Team with Limitless Potential</h3>
<p>The Wah Nam basketball team was initially formed by young people from the Yu Garden Road area, mainly the Lau brothers. It was later renamed the Wah Nam Athletic Association. Recently, it became affiliated with the sports department of the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai. With the leadership of Suet Chung and the enthusiastic guidance of senior sportsman Cheung Lok-chi, their skills have improved rapidly and they have become a strong team. Players Lau Fuk-sin and Li Yin-ching are studying at Fudan University, Lau Fuk-keung is at Nantong University, and Lau Fuk-ki, Tang Kwok-cheung, and Kwan Luk-cheung are at St. John's University. Fuk-ki is also good at drama. Ho Kam-kwai and Li Sui-hung are students who have returned from Japan and are now working for the Public Works Department. Tang Ying-zhen is also studying. They are handsome and promising young men with unlimited potential.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the World of Sports</h3>
<p>Tai Cheung-ling, the leader of Chung Pak, is broad-minded and stout. He arrived at the venue before 6 PM the night before the match with the Swatow team. After having dinner downstairs, he bought dozens of tickets and, standing next to the ticket collector, distributed them to those who came with the team, so that everyone could enter with a ticket. This man is not only enthusiastic about promoting sports but also happy to contribute generously. Ka-yung, Ka-man and Ka-piu have a strong interest in sports. They attend every match of the Shen Bao Cup Division A basketball tournament. They told people that coming to watch the games can increase funding for student aid, which makes them even more interested. After the Swatow team beat Chung Pak, Lin wrote a poem saying: "We must continue to work hard, and dare not be complacent." In fact, Chung Pak neglected practice, so we were able to win. It is said that Cheung Bong-lun's basketball skills are better than his football skills, which is insightful. The Phoenix Cup Basketball Tournament, organized by the Pei Cheng Electrical Factory, is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony today, with three exciting basketball games and awards presented by celebrities. The organizers have also printed a special issue, and a grand occasion is expected. The location is the China Film Studio court on Hua Shan Road. Chow Man, is called "Big Sister" by the members of the All-Star team. Yuen team’s Yim Man is a "sweet girl" on the court, because of her smiling face. (Basketball King)</p>
<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (II)</h3>
<p>— Leung Siu-on</p>
<p>Basketball, in its initial period, already contained the factors of its great success. It was founded in a school for training YMCA secretaries. After graduating, the secretaries were dispersed to YMCA branches throughout the United States, serving in the gymnasium affairs, and basketball thus became extremely popular throughout the United States. Dr. Gulick, who was enthusiastic about sports, saw the potential of basketball development and proposed to expand the extremely simple rules set by Naismith, which were first adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States. The following year, universities began basketball training one after another. In 1893, Yale University organized a basketball team, making it the earliest university with a basketball team. In 1900, Senda Abbott at Smith College, pioneered women's basketball. In 1902, the first intercollegiate basketball league came into being. In 1905, the Western United States held a basketball conference. Since then, all middle schools, public education centers, sports organizations, specialized professions, and industrial institutions have practiced basketball. Before long, basketball became widespread, even popular in all countries around the world. Basketball also spread to the East extremely quickly. In the second year of its creation, that is, in 1892, it was introduced to China. Boo Gailey, the basketball center of Princeton University in the United States, first brought basketball to Tianjin. In the same year, Duncan Patton went to India and also introduced basketball to India. In 1900, Lshakawa introduced basketball to Japan. During the Boxer Rebellion, after the Allied forces of the United States entered Beijing, basketball followed the American army and spread to Beiping in our country. In 1916, Charles Siler, a graduate of Kanses "U" University in the United States, revitalized basketball in Tianjin, China, and developed it. Because of gaining the advantage of being ahead of the trend, it is no wonder that Tianjin later became the source of basketball talents in our country. In 1905, the 20th Regiment of the US Army from Kansas was sent to the Philippines, and under the leadership of Fred Funston, basketball also expanded in the Philippines. As for Europe, because the United States sent missionaries and YMCA secretaries to serve in various parts of Europe, within a few years, basketball spread to major cities in Europe. Basketball's ability to spread around the world in a short period of time is unmatched by any other sport, and its value in providing health and entertainment to people in all countries is truly worthy of our praise. The initial basketball rules consisted of only thirteen articles, which were formulated by Naismith in 1892. These rules were then called YMCA rules. Later, at the suggestion of Dr. Gulick, the Amateur Athletic Union expanded them to twenty-two articles. However, the expanded rules, due to different interpretations by various parties, caused confusion and conflict. At the same time, school federations and professional teams each formulated their own common rules, forming a phenomenon of establishing separate factions. This situation did not disappear until the Basketball Rules Joint Committee was successfully organized in 1915. The joint committee was organized by representatives from the Canadian Athletic Association, school federations, and amateur athletic unions. In 1933, the Road Joint Committee agreed to disband. Another successor organization was created, namely the current National Basketball Committee of the United States and Canada. Our country once modified the main points of the American rules and made them the current rules of the International Basketball Association that are being adopted. The Shanghai Western YMCA has always used the American rules, while the Chinese YMCA uses the international rules. It is a pity that teams are often unaware of this point, which often leads to misunderstandings. The Basketball Rules Committee meets every year in September, before the start of the basketball season, to discuss issues such as the retention, abolition, addition and subtraction of rules. Since the Far Eastern Games were discontinued, the international rules have not been modified since 1938 to the present. In 1940, when I completed my studies at Springfield College and was about to return to China, Naismith, the inventor of basketball, was invited to return to his alma mater to give a speech to his old classmates, and I had the opportunity to meet him again. According to what he told me at the time, what he felt most happy about in his life was in 1936, when he was invited to the Berlin Olympics and saw the representative teams from 21 countries participating in the basketball competition, each arranged under the flags of their respective countries, listening to him say a few words of congratulations and congratulations. The first game was China against Japan. The final championship game was the United States against Canada, and Shu Hong from China served as the referee. Later, he was invited to a banquet, attended by 19 old Springfield College students, all of whom were instructors of the basketball teams of various countries. At that time, his inner joy was beyond words. He never imagined that his invention 45 years ago would have such great achievements. He never imagined that basketball would become a movement for establishing friendship between countries today. Naismith unfortunately died of illness in the United States in 1940. However, his spirit and his contributions are forever worthy of admiration by people all over the world.</p>

<p>Thirty-six: Stationary Running Running or other exercises that require deeper and longer breathing than walking should be practiced daily. In large cities, on the streets, vehicles and pedestrians come and go endlessly, so it is very inconvenient to practice running. The purpose of running is for health and entertainment, but the result may be the opposite. Moreover, running fast in crowds inevitably makes people suspicious, which is also an obstacle to this exercise. However, there is a way to avoid this difficulty, which is what is called stationary running. Lean your body forward, adopting the posture of a sprinter at the starting line. Clench your fists and place them on your chest, swinging your arms, and your hands will swing with them. Close your mouth and breathe through your nose. Run, but do not move out of your upright position. At first, it should be slow, then run faster and faster, then gradually reduce your speed until you stop. It is best to stand outdoors in a ventilated place, or you can stand by the window. Running; stopping; (fifty steps). Note: When your foot lands, silently count a step in your mind. Practice especially about running two hundred steps to five hundred steps. Thirty-seven: Fatigue in the Waist and Back Do scholars also feel fatigue in the waist and back?
