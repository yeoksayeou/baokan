<h3 id="c1">日大本營昨發表台灣東海面大捷敵美太平洋主力艦隊全部擊滅 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午三時發表：日軍部隊繼續追擊潰走之機動部隊，截止現在，判明之戰果（包括已發表者）如左：擊沉轟沉航空母艦十艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘。擊毀航空母艦三艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦四艘，艦型不明者十一艘。　　東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十五日下午發表之台灣東方海面戰果，僅十二十三兩日戰果內所確實判明者，其後十四十五兩日，復有驚異之戰報，十六日下午陸續發表。又此次壓倒之戰果，實可與日俄戰役相匹也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日海軍在太平洋有必勝絕對把握松島部長談大捷之因素 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>日本駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，昨（十六日）就台灣勝利事，發表談話如次：　　今天發表帝國在台灣方面偉大的戰果，覺得很爲欣幸。自從本月十日開始，在台灣，琉球，菲律賓東方海面，先後搜覔敵美的艦隊，連續幾天，施以極猛烈的攻擊，迄至今天爲止，日本大本營發表的戰果如下；　　艦　　類　　　擊沉　　擊毀　　合　計　　航空母艦　　　十艘　　三艘　　十三艘　　戰艦　　　　　二艘　　一艘　　　三艘　　巡洋艦　　　　三艘　　四艘　　　七艘　　驅逐艦　　　　一艘　　　　　　　一艘　　艦型不明者　　　　　十一艘　　十一艘</p>
<h3 id="c3">兩種企圖變成幻影 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>敵美艦隊係哈爾賓統率之太平洋第三艦隊在台灣東方海面出現者，爲敵方最精銳之機動部隊，由米契爾中將指揮。經此次慘敗後，米契爾爲收拾殘局，在殘餘之航空母艦敗走時，企圖掩護安全撤退，因有十五日轟炸馬尼刺。但日軍航空部隊絕不輕易放鬆，猛烈邀擊，在馬尼刺東方海面續獲如下戰果：擊沉航空母艦一艘，擊破三艘，擊破戰艦（或巡洋艦）一艘，擊落飛機三十架以上。　　這次戰役中，敵美太平洋方面艦隊的主力，已經消滅殆盡。當敵方攻佔塞班島之後，氣燄萬丈，傲視一切，以爲日軍力量單獨不堪。而日軍將士經塞班一役之後，給予深切教訓，同分敵愾之心益爲昂揚，果然在這次戰役中，陸海軍緊密協力作戰，帝獲得偉大戰果。　　敵方此次發動台灣戰役，它的企圖不外兩種。第一，先從此方面攻勢得手以後，俾可在中國沿岸登陸。第二，截斷日本本土與南方諸地域的聯絡。但其結果，在攻勢未成熟前，即被日軍擊潰，使企圖變成幻影而已。同時，本月十一日美國華盛頓某軍事家沿聲稱，美在亞洲勝利後，則中國沿岸登陸，不久即可實現，乃時僅數日，日軍戰果的事實，已將敵美所謂軍事專家的夢讛揭穿。</p>
<h3 id="c4">敵兵五萬葬身魚腹 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>其次敵美於攻佔塞班島後，想繼續推進作戰計劃，所以，對於此次台灣戰役，挑選最精銳之航空母艦等，出動主力，以圖一逞，可是，敵美用力愈大，此次所受的打擊也愈重，即謂敵美艦隊主力整個消滅，亦不爲過，就此次擊沉之航空母艦，以及十月三日日潛艇所獲戰果，合併擊沉擊毀航空母艦共有十六艘之多。擊沉擊毀之各種艦類統計，共有四十二艘。我們所擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦，同時一定有敵機毀滅，平均與每一艘航空母艦連帶擊毀的飛機約爲五十架，則至少有八百架敵機同歸於盡，其餘空戰中擊毀者尚不計有內。其次，毀損敵艦四十二艘中，至少有五萬海軍士兵葬身魚腹，這是至低數目的估計。而敵方於倉皇狼狽之餘，想掩蔽敗績，乃於廣播中，對於台灣，菲律賓海面的艦隊損失，毫未提及，而更可笑的，則謂空襲台灣僅損失飛機七架，可見狼狽與欺騙其國民的醜態畢露了。</p>
<h3 id="c5">此次海戰意義重大 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>我們更分析這次敵美對台灣琉球先由侵略而作戰，由侵略作戰轉變爲決戰局面，日本對此偉大的海戰，雖形式與昔年日本海海戰不同，但實際上的戰果意義，與日本海海戰，夏威夷海戰同爲著名的海戰。羅斯福在其競選四屆總統之前，欲以冒險的戰果，爲競選成功的工具，但如今的結果，遭受慘敗，適得其反。羅斯福爲其個人地位的欲望，竟驅使美海軍作此冒險行動，試問羅斯福何以對此役陣亡將士及其遺族的爲個人名位而犧牲，更何以對美國人民之欺騙而自圓其說。至於日本這次的戰功，雖屬空前大捷，但動員軍力，並非全部聯合艦隊，最大的功績，則爲航空部隊。自從前年八月所羅門加達爾卡納爾大會戰以後，直至最近止，日本在太平洋上屢取防守態勢，但因這一次的戰役，得到極大的轉變。從此可以斷言，帝國海軍在太平洋上的必勝前途，絕對有把握。敵美向來誇稱擁有世界最強大的海軍，但實際上十分之八的海軍力量已經喪亡，僅僅殘留的十分之二，今後以之對付日本，試問焉能不敗。所以帝國海軍已有必勝信念，敵方任何企圖，均有隨時消滅的把握與自信。</p>
<h3 id="c6">加緊生產貢獻物資 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>最後日軍這次偉大戰果，成功的困素，首先是托庇天皇陛下的蔭福，以及將士的用命。另一因素，則爲中日兩國的密切協力，加緊生產，貢獻物資。今後中國方面充分協力再加緊生產，貢獻物力，日軍由守勢變爲攻勢，則更大的戰果，必將續至。我更期望於上海的中國人士，不爲敵人的流言蜚語所動搖信念，絕對信賴日本在軍事方面的力量，則大東亞戰爭的完遂爲期不遠了。</p>
<h3 id="c7">東亞戰局轉機開始 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　近兩月來，敵美太平洋攻勢之漸趨熾烈，固無法否認，惟有識人士僉認，戰局之戰重情勢，並未眞如一般想像者之甚，因在長期戰之情形下，戰局上局部之得失，實不能影響全局，太平洋戰局因戰塲乃爲廣闊浩瀚之水面，勝負之決定，自未可以某一島嶼之得失爲轉移，現敵美東進愈深，離其本土愈遠，從而接濟之困難亦愈甚，反之，日本方面不僅保有開戰以來之優越地位，且其戰爭指導當局之隱忍自重，決心靜待時機，於敵軍又深入至絕對威力圈內，再以向未出動之精銳艦隊猛擊敵軍，有力之軍事家過去即如此觀察，茲觀日大本營前日之發表謂，此次之日軍部隊中，包括海軍艦隊云云，乃益信而有徵。再觀日大本營十六日之發表，則敵軍機動部隊於潰敗之中，因日軍之追擊，復遭致命打擊，被轟沉擊沉之敵艦艇，僅航空母艦計達十艘之多，於此所可指出者，即不僅日軍之威力堅強，一如昔日並未稍減弱，且以所獲戰果而言，可推知日是軍勢力，實有愈戰愈強之勢，同時，敵美方面其企圖或欲由此侵攻菲島，台灣乃至在中國大陸沿岸登陸，但經此次日軍在台灣東方海面之痛擊，不但敵軍巳潰不成軍，且徵諸日當局最近以來之數次正式與非正式表明，可見日軍之作戰，更將於最近期內，由守勢而轉取攻勢，預料大東亞戰局之一大轉機，亦即將於此開始，而此次攻敵美之大蠢動，日方固可顯示尼米資之燥急不安。同時亦因美總統改選期近，羅斯福爲取得其國民穩固地位，故竟不計成敗，冒險深入，突犯台灣，集中海空軍全力進襲，企圖施行突破戰，日海空軍爲確保大東亞戰爭之必勝態勢，以無敵艦隊加以邀擊，乃在意料之中。今敵機動部隊已將完全擊潰，日軍且正績行追擊擴大戰果中，預料敵美太平洋艦隊遭此猛烈之痛擊，雖其攻勢未必從此中止，然經此失敗，敵美軍戰意定然喪失，日軍以必勝態勢之確立，今後敵美如再不自量力，企圖東侵，必然自遭損失與犧牲，是以此次台灣海面之追擊戰，於戰局成敗影響至大，故衆信日軍在不久將來定有更偉大戰果，而大東亞民族解放戰之勝利，亦可於此獲得保證。日首相</p>
<h3 id="c8">參拜神宮默告戰捷陸海兩相報告戰況 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日小磯首相，杉山陸相，米內海相，十六日下午三時半，同赴明治神宮，靖國神社參拜，默告台灣海面戰捷。　　東京十六日中央社電　日定例閣議，十六日上午九時於首相官邸舉行，小磯首相及全體閣僚均出席，由杉山陸相及米內海相詳細報告於台灣東方海面擊潰敵機動部隊之戰況。閣議後，小磯首相更發表談話如次：預料中之決戰終於開始，陸海軍於御稜威下，於台灣東方海面之最初戰鬥中，已獲得大戰果，此次給予敵機動部隊之大打擊，實爲今後獲勝這預兆，本人願與諸君同申慶祝。此次戰鬥中，陸軍雷擊隊亦行參加，尤以陸海軍協力一致，勇戰結果，獲得如次大戰果，值得慶幸。本人於此對增產飛機及其他軍需生產者表示感激，更望今後努力邁進增產，更鑒於時局前途，官民一體，應再加努力，以期從速完遂戰爭。</p>
<h3 id="c9">台灣東方海上兩次殲滅戰日海軍獲綜合大戰果 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　日海軍部隊自十四日晨以來，即急追滿身創痍開始遁走之敵機動部隊，並在台灣東方海上分晝夜兩次，展開大規範殲滅戰，使戰果更趨擴大，日大本營十六日將截至現在止，經判明之日軍綜合戰果及繼續猛擊敵敗退艦隊之情形，詳予發表，一俟日機歸還原防後，日軍之戰果，將更可望有詳盡之報告，惟由於日軍十二·十三兩日對敵繼續攻擊，敵軍戰鬥能力，已喪失泰半，日軍於十四日所發動之攻擊，亦會使敵高射砲失其效能，綜計在此數日間，日軍所獲之戰果非常偉大，計轟沉敵艦八艘，其中有航空母艦三艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，擊破敵艦四艘，其中有航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦三艦。蓋自十二日以來三日間之綜合戰果，計擊沉航空母艦十艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊破其航空母艦三艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦四艘，艦種不詳者之敵艦十一艘，綜計擊沉擊毀共三十五艘，茲將攻擊情形分誌如次：十四日下午三時十五分左右，日空軍編隊，雖因天氣亞劣，視綫糢糊，然仍出動搜索敵蹤，移時，即發現在遁走中掩敵艦隊，日機於是立即折散編隊，由各機單獨實行攻擊，其時，敵巡洋艦隊一艘在艦橋附近中彈，黑烟沖天，敵巡洋艦二艘亦起火焚燒。此等敵艦被炸起火焚燒，已進退維谷，日轟炸機隊確認敵此種狼狽情形後，即行飛返，在歸途中亦會睹見敵航空母艦一艘發火焚燒之情形，此爲第一次轟炸之經過。第二次轟炸之經過情形，日轟炸機隊於下午七時左右開抵戰塲後，即與敵戰鬥機羣發生遭遇戰，於擊落其一架後，即衝入敵艦羣之所在地，反覆加以熾烈攻擊，於是敵大型航空母艦一艘，小型母艦一艘，甲型巡洋艦一艘，當即起火焚燒，其中一艘並發生大火，在海中沉沒，他如敵小型航空母艦一艘，戰艦一艘，乙級巡洋艦二艘，亦多處引起火炎，其中戰艦一艘瞬間即被轟沉，日轟炸機隊確認此種情形歸還基地時，亦會聞悉敵艦於戰塲附近之爆炸音響。</p>

<p>問：敵美這次發動台灣海面攻勢，傾其太平洋艦隊主力，亟圖得逞，但被盟邦日本海陸軍聯合擊滅，前途非常悲慘吧！　　答：敵美這次輕舉妄動，致受致命打擊。就整個大東亞戰局而言，固然愈益接近我們的勝利，可是，敵美鼓其殘餘力量，再圖蠢動，自亦在意中。所以，我們爲確保完遂勝利，在這次大捷以後，更要把握攻勢機先，再度予敵人以打擊，對於這一點，盟邦軍事當局已經聲明由守勢轉爲攻勢了。　　問：不過，我們推測敵人未來的企圖，切實有利。高見以爲何如？　　答：不錯。所以，我們要分析敵人發動這次戰役的目的。簡單言之，內在的目的，是羅斯福企圖以戰勝消息爲競選四屆總統的工具，亦即爲爭取個人名位而不惜冒險。外在的目的，因爲中國大陸戰爭，自洛陽長沙衡陽相繼失陷，桂林危急，渝美戰爭企圖完全失敗，於是力圖在太平洋上打開出路，挽救頹勢的情勢愈益焦急。同時，在攻佔數小島後，野心愈甚，思對菲律賓染指，但爲解除後顧之憂，於是先發動台灣攻勢。這是敵美過去的企圖，現在顯已失敗。至於未來的企圖，主要者仍在對菲及對中國大陸，不過經此次敗北後，在聲勢上巳不免強弩之末了。　　問：形勢雖然如此，可是，敵美尚有殘餘的兵力，我們也不可忽視輕敵吧！　　答：這次台灣海面的大捷，主要因素當然是盟邦陸海軍協同發揮實力所致，絕非僥倖的成功。當然，盟邦當局也決不會忽視敵人的殘餘力量而輕敵的。不過，我們中國是參戰國家，對於大東亞戰爭，旣然有共同爭取勝利的絕對責任。同時，我們更須認識，敵人最大目的之一就是接近中國大陸，萬一僥倖成功，則對中國人民將有不可避免的損害與痛苦。所以，我們更應貢獻所有力量，直接有利於戰爭勝利，間接就是防免自己的損害。　　問：我們旣然有此責任，究應怎樣的貢獻力量呢？　　答：就我們的能力及環境而言，我們沒有軍隊參加作戰，惟有從充實戰爭資源方面貢獻與協力，以期增強戰爭的總力。例如努力於增加生產，供給軍用物資等等。　　答：近來一般人對於大東亞戰局似乎不能樂觀，其原因一部分受了敵人的虛僞宣傳所朦蔽。一部分則爲太平洋上若干小島的失陷。可是，由於這次台灣海而一役的大捷，證明敵我雙方戰鬥力量的不同。所以，對於一般人的悲觀，可以得到轉變的機會，不安的情緒可以從此掃除，從此消滅。同時，一年來敵方虛僞的宣傳，也由於這次大捷而揭穿了。</p>

<p>南京十六日中央社電　此次日軍於台灣東方，擊沉擊毀敵艦三十五艘之大戰果發表後，各方對之莫不欣奮異常。此予美海軍之打擊，至爲重大，記者當即向我海軍部長任援道氏，叩詢對此次海戰之感想，當承延見，談稱：[本人於日前晤及日本駐華艦隊松島部長，討論太平洋海戰時，余即深信日本海戰，必能擊敗美國海軍，蓋不論海陸空戰，欲獲取勝利，必須具有利於戰爭之條件，所謂條件，即戰理戰力及士氣是也。依戰理言，美國補給路綫旣具，又勞師遠征，適爲兵家所忌。反之，日軍補給路綫旣短，且以逸待勞，此敵必敗者一。以戰力言，美機動部隊力量雖以龐大，但其出動之某一地，決不致超過某一地之日聯合艦隊力量，其作戰力亦決不如日艦雄厚，此敵必敗者二。依士氣言，美海軍於塞班島·大宮島等戰役後，士氣不免驕傲，而日海軍因塞班島等海戰之教訓與指示，莫不同仇敵愾，因是士氣益爲振奮，此敵必敗者三。有此三點，美海軍安得不敗乎。本人於日前即斷言美海軍必將大敗，今消息傳來，美海軍果有此次台灣東方海面之慘敗，惟我人經此次海戰勝利後，更應堅定信念，努力奮鬥，不至最後勝利完成時不止。同時吾人在長江沿岸，直達台灣，當更加強防務，協力日本，使日海軍力量，得全力置於戰爭。</p>

<p>南京十六日中央社電　邇來京滬等地黑市米價狂漲，以致刺激一般物價亦告升騰，其影響及於民生問題，關係至大。中央社記者昨特爲此，分訪實業部米統會京辦事處等有關機關，探詢當局對此問題之對策如何，茲分誌如下：　　實業部姜次長談稱：一問，邇來各地黑市米價及一般物價無不狂漲，其影響民生至鉅，實部對此是否正籌謀有效對策？答，本部對物價問題無時不在嚴密注視中，上月底在京召集經濟聯絡座談會席上，亦會詳細討論及之。陳部長更再三以管理物價方策，諄諄指示與會各員。至近來黑市米價狂漲，因之刺激一般物價，威脅民生，本部以職責所在，刻正與有關各方面，研求有效對策中，日內即可正式決定，付之實施，務使戢止漲風，安定民生。惟是物價之管理，應爲全部的，而非局部的，須中央與地方間，以及各地方與地方間，均應緊密聯繫，相互呼應，通盤籌劃，始克奏效。二問，關於米價之上漲，一般意見均歸咎於配給量之不敷，及不能按期發售，再者邇來京滬兩市米統會，均嚴厲禁止八公斤以上之自由携帶，此與當局收　工作，或有裨益，但因限制過嚴，小販來衡，亦爲刺激黑市米價上漲主因之一，敢問當局對此作何考慮？答，對米統會之市民戶口米配給，本部會層促該會按期配發，而該會終不能如期配出，實引爲憾事。因一方面不能按期配發戶口米，而一方面又嚴厲限制人民自由携帶數量，以致促成黑市米價之上漲，固亦爲其一部份之理由，如戶口米能按期配出後，則確信目前之黑市漲風，即可消弭，故此點尚盼米統會當局加以注意。　　米統會京辦事處賈副主任談：一問，邇來黑市米價已迫進萬元大關，一般意見均歸咎於配給之一再脫期，貴會職責所在，關於此點其將何以自圓其說？答，過去米統會因得於運輸之困難，及新舊人事之交替關係，對於配給食米時有脫期，但經本辦事處努力強化，採購運京，已將兩萬石新米運來入倉，足夠此次配米之用。另有五萬石亦將於最近源源運米，故此次對於市民之配給，決定在三五日內即可將第一次新配米發出，而第二次配米亦可在一個月之內繼續配發。二問，當局一方面遲遲配給戶口米，而一方又嚴禁携一斗以上米入境，此種辦法於貴會收買工作或有裨益，但因小販來源過稀，市內則愈感供不應求，致米價狂漲，此種情形，似有愼重考慮之必要。答，限制携米入境問題，行政院有令公佈，上海總會方面亦會嚴重考慮此項問題，但須待呈請行政院核准後，方可決定。</p>

<p>本報資料室　　一地理　　台灣全島約三分之二爲山岳地帶，三千米以上的高峯達六十二座之多。東部多斷崖，西部則盡爲平原，有濁水溪與大甲溪等貫流其間，故物產豐富，風景美麗。北回歸綫橫斷中央，把該島分爲南北二部，當[風季][雨季]期中，天氣十分陰　，濃霧罩着山坡和村落，風景顯出萬分的蒼綠而秀麗。台灣山綿亙全島，山中有深寬的溪潤，和廣大的榕樹林。山峯峻峭，都是斷崖千仞，棧道就架在兩峯之間，彷彿是天然的搖籃。海濱一帶，山脈更爲奇險，有高聳直懸七千呎的山壁，由上面俯視，只見怒濤奔湧，白浪滔天，蔚爲奇觀。這裹有[世界第一絕壁]之稱，其險狀自可想見。地屬亞勢帶，雖在冬季，除高山外不見降雪。氣溫之降至冰點以下者極少，故草木繁盛，適於農業。　　二碉積與人口（一九四○年）州廳名　　面積（平方公里）　　　人口台北州　　　四·五九四　　　一·二三三·八八二新竹州　　　四·五七○　　　　　八三八·○一一台中州　　　七·三八三　　　一·三八○·一八七台南州　　　五·四二一　　　一·五五○·六九五高雄州　　　五·七二三　　　　　九三○·三八三台東廳　　　三·五一五　　　　　　九三·一三八花蓮港廳　　四·六二九　　　　　一五三·七八五澎湖廳　　　　　一二七　　　　　　六九·三八七　　台灣之面積合計爲三五·九六一平方公里，總人口爲六·二四九·四六八人。其中計日本人三六五·六八二人，朝鮮人二·五三九人，本島人五·八三二·六八二人，對國人四八·五六五人。　　三政治與軍事　　日本的統治台灣，與朝鮮同，亦設總督府。另設評議會，爲總督之諮詢機關，對於重要施政，有建議於總督之權能。全島分五州三廳，即台北，新竹，台中，台南，高雄五州，台東，花蓮港，澎湖三廳。下復分爲十一市，四十五郡，分別由州知事，廳長，市長，郡守等統治之。　　台灣之國防，在基隆，高隆，及澎湖島東西灣均有要塞，台北及台南各置有守備隊司令部，台北市則有軍司令部。一九四二年以後，實施志願兵制度，並將實行徵兵。　　四經濟　　台灣之主要產物爲為與糖，其他產業較爲落後。惟自時局緊張以來，該島產業界已顯見趨向於戰時體制，新興產業殊形活躍。然農業仍爲該島之主要產業。全島人口約有百分之五十三從事於此。一九三八年九月設置台灣重要農產業調整委員會，並決定自一九三九年起樹立十年間重要農產物之增產計劃。一九四○年起，實施統制島內米的消費。　　台灣氣候最適於米作，每年二熟，其主要產地爲台中，台北，新竹，台南及高雄各地，其米產之半數移入日本。甘蔗爲次於米之主要產物，栽培面積遍於全島，年產總額爲八千萬圓。甘薯爲台灣三大農產物之一，以台南州爲主要產地，年產額三千萬圓。此外，茶爲該島之主要輸出品，其主要產地爲台北與新竹三州。其他有黃麻，苧蔴，蓖麻，棉花等。果實方面，以香蕉與風梨爲大宗。　　台灣之主要鑛產物爲砂金，金，銅，煤，石油等。煤爲該島鑛產物之大宗，至於石油，則更努力開發，最近新竹州之錦水與竹東，台南卅之新營與竹頭崎等鑛山，均已鑿井成功。　　台灣工業以製糖製茶等農產加工業爲中心，近年來近代工業亦漸次發展。如紡織工業，化學工業，及金屬電氣工業等成績，均斐然可觀。　　五都市　　基隆　基隆爲台灣的大商港，位於台灣之北端，距日本門司約七百五十五哩，扼中國南海，東海之中央，地位極爲重要。水陸交通均甚便利。可停泊萬餘噸的郵船，其重要有如日本的橫濱。日本重要交通機關，金融組織在這裹都有運行。主要產物爲魚類，麵粉，肥料，煤等。　　台北　台北爲台島的首都，台灣總督駐節於此，爲該島政治，經濟，文化，產業的中心地。市內街市縱橫，風景向稱美麗，有[東洋的小巴黎]之稱，商業極爲繁盛。而台灣大學，台灣銀行總行，皆設於此。台北市西鄰淡水河，北面大屯山，七星山，東鄰肥田，沃野，一望無際。台北市可分爲城內，大稻堤，萬華三區。城內爲日人居位之所，政治，經濟，文化上各種設備已應有盡有。大稻堤爲本島人居位之所，爲本市之商業區域，米茶之交易，多以此處爲中心。萬華爲本市最古之街市，現祗爲一熱鬧區域而已。　　新竹　新竹昔稱竹塹，乃蕃族棲息的荒博地。一七三四年我國已有商船至竹塹港，爲西部台灣的文化中心。現仍爲台北的主要都市，爲台灣產糖區域。　　台中　台中相當於日本的京都，爲台灣正中的都會，亦台灣米與香蕉等的主要出產地。街市頗爲整潔，有健康都市之稱。　　嘉義　嘉義爲台灣的產業中心地，鐵路四通八達，實爲物產的集散地。市街整麗，工業發達，製糖工廠大多在此地。台灣總督府所經營的營林所的製材工塲，其規模的偉大，稱[遠東第一]。　　台南　台南爲台灣最古的都會，就是所謂鄭氏三代的蕃都。自清朝領有台灣以來，三百餘年間，俱以台南爲首府，迨日本統治後，始將首府移於台北，現此地區成爲全島第二殷盛的文化都市。　　高雄　高雄市爲台灣南部唯一的良港，壽山與旗後半島扼其港口，使航洋汽船不能自由出入，由此至福州僅三四哩，厦門一五六哩，汕頭二五○哩，香港三二五哩，廣州四○五哩，至於南洋諸港，當然極便利。所以佔產業罪濟上很重要的地位，而在軍事上尤被重視。　　屏南　位於台灣南端的屏東市，不但爲產業都市，而且亦爲日本南方第一綫的國防都市。日本在此地設有航空隊。此地農產物也頗豐富。如甘蔗，香蕉，木瓜等出產頗多。</p>

<p>武內文彬申述感想　　日大本營發表，在台灣東方海面擊滅敵美艦隊之消息，此間中日外各方面咸表驚愕，上海日僑商工會議所常務理事武內文彬氏，特發表談話，申述戰勝之感激，與將來之覺悟。該氏稱：[此次台灣東方海面海戰，可謂媲美日俄戰爭，當時日本海海戰之決定性戰果，余接獲此捷報後，即考慮到二點，第一驕者不久，第二東亞十萬萬民族，現在已充分發揮東亞實力。</p>
<h3 id="c26">驕者不久 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>舉一實例，即如日前攻擊琉球時敵方機動部隊一面吸烟，一面加砲彈，如此完全顯露專恃物量，輕視日本之美國本來面目。所謂驕者不久，此次企圖登陸台灣之哈爾塞，實爲代表的美國人。今番美國太平洋艦隊攻擊台灣，是爲盲目猛進之代表作品。此次捷報，使日本一億國民，更加強必勝之觀念，實行生產第一，經濟第一主義的總動員，國內體制愈益鞏固，舉國團結向最後突擊戰前進。又盟邦中國諸君，亦益將認識東亞實力加強，已屆眞正實踐中日兩國一體向結成新東亞邁進之秋的決意，東亞十億民族應團結一致，奮起擊滅英美。在三十餘年前岡倉天心所倡之亞細亞，所謂[集結一致]之事實，已到眞正確立之前夕，無論重慶或延安，得此戰報後，諒亦想到彼等在今日應脫却東亞叛逆之邪道，改取東亞大道之態度。此次決定性的戰勝及於歐洲之影響亦極重大，史太林，希特勒，蔣介石，各人所表示之神情，亦可以想見，由於此次決勝，可感到戰事巳解決到百分之八十，但今後應關心者，乃爲百分之八十以外所殘餘之任務，應以謙讓的態度，前綫後方</p>
<h3 id="c27">一體努力 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>其中最必要厥爲生產戰，飛機，船，以及武器，相應後方的生產戰，是擴大戰果，制敵人於死地之唯一途徑。台灣海戰及目前正在開展中的菲島海戰中，將日本兼備生產戰[質]與[量]之事實，表示於世人之前，吾人應覺悟要堅持經濟戰生產戰至最後五分鍾。更有同標重要的思想戰，中日兩國國民已認識東亞實力，對英美一無可懼，上海在世界大戰中爲最重要的思想戰決戰塲，在今日必須確立思想戰體制，確立東亞必勝英美必滅之思想態勢，日本因於日本海海戰地位，已提高至世界的日本，東亞由於此次新日本海海戰成爲世界的東亞，東亞唯有一個東亞，決不能淪爲英美奴隸，現在已屆十億一心一德，向解放東亞奮鬥之秋。]</p>

<p>松平部長談歸國感想　　盟邦日本大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，此次因公回國，歷時四星期，始於最近返滬，昨（十六）日下午二時半，大使館循例主持之報道常會，松平部辰欣然偕同福間副領事出席，會見本市中國新聞記者，即席出松平部長發表歸國後之感想，目見國內決戰體制之完成，全國朝野一致協力，滅私奉公精神蓬勃，特發表談話闡述綦詳。茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<h3 id="c47">國民一致滅私奉公 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>松平部長謂：首[本人此次因公回國，有所聯絡任務，在國內逗留四星期，最近方始返滬，目見國內決戰體制完成，殊爲欣快，尤其在思想方面，必勝信念之堅定，充滿各階層之每個國民的胸懷中，舉凡青少年壯年，以及老弱婦女，均爲決戰精神熱烈鼓舞，尤對滅私奉公的精神，非常蓬勃，深爲感動，向推進增加戰力之途邁進。同時全國民的心境，明郎純潔，充滿當前內閣所昭示大和魂的氣魄，更堪欣慰。此外在國民的各階段。各方均有建設言論之抬頭展開，而官廳公司中之女職員們，技術熟練，與一般民衆和藹可親，并在上下國民階段中，均具有心的革新精神，如軍需物資之獻納，均自動赤誠奉獻，成績至爲良好。惟因國民獻納踴躍，物資豐富，辦事人員工作準備，忙碌異常，不能分身，深感困難，是實爲良好現象。在此國家艱難之際，國民均自然深切發動我大和民族精神，同時本人深感全國民的自覺，對此解放戰爭，在地理歷史與血統上，有聯合大東亞之全民族，并求各民族之發展，期達到新生之目的，駢肩與大東亞各國共同奮鬥。</p>
<h3 id="c48">國民勤勞精神可佩 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>滬本日民國來對大東亞各地民衆之親愛情緒，繼續猛增，而對各民族的關懷，尤爲深切，莫不如兄弟親睦之態度無異，是在大東亞戰事前之情形所未有，數年來完全轉變親愛熱誠。其次，本人深感最愉快者，即全國各方均具有[國民勤勞]澈底之精神，發揮總力，凝結一體，完成大時代偉大的奇蹟。在去秋時，某地爲建造木船，派遣勤勞團三百五十名，至目的地後，一無設備，僅見葦章業生，意料不到勤勞團員之百折不撓，在指導員下，全體打成一片，不眠不休，以同苦的精神，首先建築船塢，直至本年九月，已建竣木船不下八十餘艘，目前已完成廣大的造船塢，工人已有五千餘名，於此所見事實，殊爲我人所意料不及者。其首批勤勞團，均爲監獄中之辦犯服役，本人在國親自目見各種情形，至返回上海，尚有頗多應盡未盡之事，堆積不少。]最後部長又謂：[中日雙方鑒此情形，應爲建設確立必勝體制起見，雙方在充分認識及瞭解下，全力推行具體之方針，斯乃極深切需要之事。]</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday That in a Great Victory in the Eastern Sea Off Taiwan, the Enemy American Pacific Main Fleet Was Completely Annihilated <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 16th: Japanese forces continue to pursue the routed mobile units. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle (including those already announced) are as follows: Ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk or bombed. Three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven vessels of unknown type were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The results of the battle in the eastern sea off Taiwan, announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the afternoon of the 15th, only included those definitively confirmed from the 12th and 13th. In the subsequent 14th and 15th, there were even more astonishing battle reports, which were successively announced on the afternoon of the 16th. Furthermore, the overwhelming results of this battle can indeed be compared to the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Navy Has Absolute Confidence in Victory in the Pacific: Minister Matsushima Discusses Factors of the Great Victory <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China made the following statement yesterday (16th) regarding the victory in Taiwan:</p>
<p>I am very pleased to announce the great victory of the Empire in the Taiwan area today. Since the 10th of this month, we have been searching for the enemy American fleet in the eastern seas of Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines, and have launched extremely fierce attacks for several consecutive days. As of today, the battle results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters are as follows:</p>
<p>Vessel Type Sunk Destroyed Total</p>
<p>Aircraft Carriers 10 3 13</p>
<p>Battleships 2 1 3</p>
<p>Cruisers 3 4 7</p>
<p>Destroyers 1 1</p>
<p>Unknown Type 11 11</p>
<h3 id="e3">Two Attempts Turned into Illusions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The enemy American fleet, led by Halsey, was the Third Pacific Fleet appearing in the eastern sea off Taiwan, and it was the enemy's most elite mobile unit, commanded by Vice Admiral Mitscher. After this disastrous defeat, Mitscher, in an attempt to salvage the situation, tried to cover the safe retreat of the remaining aircraft carriers, resulting in the bombing of Manila on the 15th. However, the Japanese air force did not easily let them go, and fiercely intercepted them, achieving the following results in the eastern sea off Manila: One aircraft carrier sunk, three damaged, one battleship (or cruiser) damaged, and over thirty aircraft shot down.</p>
<p>In this battle, the main force of the enemy American Pacific Fleet has been almost completely wiped out. After the enemy occupied Saipan Island, they were extremely arrogant and looked down on everything, thinking that the Japanese forces were weak and incapable. However, after the Battle of Saipan, the Japanese soldiers were deeply taught, and their determination to fight the enemy was even more elevated. Sure enough, in this battle, the army and navy closely cooperated in the battle, and the Empire achieved a great victory.</p>
<p>The enemy's launch of the Taiwan campaign this time was motivated by no more than two intentions. First, after gaining a successful offensive in this area, they would be able to land on the Chinese coast. Second, to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern regions. However, as a result, before the offensive matured, it was crushed by the Japanese army, turning its intentions into illusions. At the same time, on the 11th of this month, an American military expert in Washington claimed that after the American victory in Asia, landing on the Chinese coast would soon be realized. However, only a few days later, the facts of the Japanese battle results have exposed the delusional dreams of the enemy American so-called military experts.</p>
<h3 id="e4">50,000 Enemy Soldiers Buried in the Bellies of Fish <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, after the enemy Americans occupied Saipan Island, they wanted to continue advancing their operational plans. Therefore, for this Taiwan campaign, they selected the most elite aircraft carriers and other vessels, and dispatched their main force in an attempt to achieve their goals. However, the more the enemy Americans exerted themselves, the heavier the blow they suffered this time. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire main force of the enemy American fleet was wiped out. Including the aircraft carriers sunk this time and the results achieved by Japanese submarines on October 3, the total number of aircraft carriers sunk and destroyed is as high as sixteen. The total number of various types of vessels sunk and destroyed is forty-two. When we sunk and destroyed enemy aircraft carriers, enemy aircraft were certainly destroyed at the same time. On average, about fifty aircraft were destroyed along with each aircraft carrier, meaning that at least eight hundred enemy aircraft were destroyed. The number of aircraft destroyed in other air battles is not included. Secondly, at least 50,000 navy soldiers were buried in the bellies of fish among the 42 enemy vessels damaged. This is the lowest estimated number. The enemy, in their panic and embarrassment, wanted to conceal their defeat. Therefore, in their broadcasts, they did not mention the losses of the fleet in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines at all. Even more ridiculous, they claimed that only seven aircraft were lost in the air raids on Taiwan, revealing their ugly state of panic and deception of their citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e5">This Naval Battle Is of Great Significance <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>We further analyze that this time the enemy Americans first invaded and then fought against Taiwan and Okinawa, turning the war from an invasion operation into a decisive battle situation. Although the form of this great naval battle for Japan is different from the naval battle of the Sea of Japan in the past, the actual battle results and significance are the same as the naval battle of the Sea of Japan and the naval battle of Hawaii, making it a famous naval battle. Before Roosevelt ran for his fourth term as president, he wanted to use risky war results as a tool for successful election, but now the result is a disastrous defeat, which is counterproductive. Roosevelt drove the American navy to take this risky action for the sake of his personal position desires. How can Roosevelt explain the sacrifices of the fallen soldiers and their families in this battle for his personal fame and position, and how can he justify his deception of the American people? As for Japan's war achievements this time, although it is an unprecedented great victory, the military power mobilized was not the entire combined fleet. The greatest achievement was the air force. Since the great battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in August of the year before last until recently, Japan has repeatedly taken a defensive posture in the Pacific. However, this war has brought about a great change. From this, it can be asserted that the Imperial Navy has absolute confidence in the future of victory in the Pacific. The enemy Americans have always boasted of having the world's most powerful navy, but in fact, eighty percent of their naval power has been lost, leaving only the remaining twenty percent. How can they not be defeated when they use this to deal with Japan in the future? Therefore, the Imperial Navy has a firm belief in victory, and has the confidence and confidence to eliminate any attempts by the enemy at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Step Up Production and Contribute Materials <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the successful factors of this great victory of the Japanese army are, first of all, thanks to the blessing of His Majesty the Emperor and the dedication of the soldiers. Another factor is the close cooperation between China and Japan, stepping up production and contributing materials. In the future, if the Chinese side fully cooperates and steps up production and contributes material resources, the Japanese army will change from a defensive to an offensive posture, and greater war results will surely follow. I also hope that the Chinese people in Shanghai will not be shaken in their beliefs by the enemy's rumors, and will absolutely trust Japan's military power, so that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is not far away.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Turning Point of the East Asian War Situation Begins <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – It cannot be denied that the enemy American Pacific offensive has gradually intensified in the past two months. However, informed sources agree that the serious situation of the war situation is not as serious as generally imagined, because in the long-term war situation, the local gains and losses on the battlefield cannot affect the overall situation. The Pacific war situation is determined not by the gains and losses of a certain island, because the battlefield is a vast and boundless expanse of water. Now, the enemy Americans are advancing deeper and deeper, farther and farther away from their homeland, and the difficulty of resupply is becoming more and more serious. On the contrary, the Japanese side not only maintains the superior position since the beginning of the war, but also the war guidance authorities are patient and self-respecting, determined to wait quietly for the opportunity. When the enemy army goes deep into the absolute power circle, they will use the elite fleet that has not yet been dispatched to fiercely attack the enemy army. Capable military experts have observed this in the past. Now, the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters the day before yesterday said that the Japanese forces this time included the naval fleet, which is even more credible and evident. Furthermore, according to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 16th, the enemy's mobile units, in the midst of defeat, suffered a fatal blow due to the pursuit of the Japanese army. The number of enemy ships bombed and sunk, including aircraft carriers alone, reached as many as ten. What can be pointed out here is not only that the power of the Japanese army is strong, as it was in the past and has not weakened slightly, but also that, in terms of the battle results obtained, it can be inferred that the Japanese military strength is actually becoming stronger as it fights. At the same time, the enemy American side may have intended to invade the Philippines, Taiwan, and even land on the Chinese mainland from this point. However, after this painful blow by the Japanese army in the eastern sea off Taiwan, not only has the enemy army been溃不成军, but also, judging from the recent formal and informal statements by the Japanese authorities, it can be seen that the Japanese army's operations will be transformed from a defensive to an offensive posture in the near future. It is expected that a major turning point in the Greater East Asia War will begin from this point. This great movement of attacking the enemy Americans, the Japanese side can indeed show Nimitz's impatience and anxiety. At the same time, because the American presidential election is approaching, Roosevelt, in order to obtain a stable position for his people, did not care about success or failure, and recklessly went deep into the area and suddenly attacked Taiwan, concentrating all the naval and air forces to launch an offensive. It was expected that the Japanese naval and air forces would ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the invincible fleet would intercept them. Now, the enemy mobile units have been completely defeated, and the Japanese army is continuing to pursue and expand the battle results. It is expected that the enemy American Pacific Fleet will suffer such a severe blow. Although its offensive may not end from this point, after this failure, the enemy American military's will to fight will surely be lost. With the establishment of the Japanese army's victorious posture, if the enemy Americans are not self-aware and attempt to invade the east again, they will inevitably suffer losses and sacrifices. Therefore, this pursuit battle in the waters off Taiwan has a great impact on the success or failure of the war situation. Therefore, many believe that the Japanese army will have even greater war results in the near future, and the victory of the Greater East Asian National Liberation War can also be guaranteed from this point.

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai visited the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine together at 3:30 PM on the 16th to silently report the victory in the seas off Taiwan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai reported in detail on the battle situation of defeating the enemy mobile units in the eastern sea off Taiwan.

This great blow to the enemy mobile units is a foreshadowing of future victories. I would like to celebrate this with you all. In this battle, the army's lightning strike team also participated. It is especially gratifying that the army and navy cooperated and fought bravely, resulting in such great war results. I would like to express my gratitude to those who increase the production of aircraft and other military supplies here, and I hope that they will continue to work hard to increase production in the future. In view of the future of the situation, the government and the people should work together to make greater efforts to complete the war as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e9">In Two Annihilation Battles in the Eastern Sea off Taiwan, the Japanese Navy Achieved Comprehensive and Great War Results <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the 14th, the Japanese naval forces have been rapidly pursuing the enemy mobile units that were fleeing with their bodies covered in wounds. They launched large-scale annihilation battles twice, day and night, in the eastern sea off Taiwan, making the battle results even greater. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 16th the confirmed comprehensive battle results of the Japanese army to date and the situation of continuing to fiercely attack the defeated enemy fleet in detail. Once the Japanese aircraft return to their original defenses, a more detailed report of the Japanese army's battle results can be expected. However, due to the Japanese army's continuous attacks on the enemy on the 12th and 13th, the enemy's combat capabilities have been mostly lost. The attack launched by the Japanese army on the 14th also made the enemy's anti-aircraft guns ineffective. In summary, the battle results obtained by the Japanese army in these days are very great. A total of eight enemy ships were sunk, including three aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers. Four enemy ships were destroyed, including one aircraft carrier and three cruisers. The comprehensive battle results for the three days since the 12th are: Ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk, and three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven enemy ships of unknown type destroyed, for a total of thirty-five ships sunk and destroyed. The attack situation is recorded as follows: Around 3:15 PM on the 14th, the Japanese air force formations, although the weather was poor and the visibility was blurry, still dispatched to search for traces of the enemy. After a while, they discovered the enemy fleet covering their retreat. The Japanese aircraft immediately dispersed the formations and carried out attacks individually. At that time, one enemy cruiser was hit near the bridge, and black smoke filled the sky. Two enemy cruisers also caught fire. These enemy ships were bombed and caught fire, making it difficult to advance or retreat. After the Japanese bomber formations confirmed this embarrassing situation of the enemy, they flew back. On the way back, they also witnessed one enemy aircraft carrier on fire. This was the process of the first bombing. The process of the second bombing was as follows: After the Japanese bomber formations arrived at the battlefield around 7:00 PM, they encountered enemy fighter groups and engaged in combat. After shooting down one of them, they rushed into the location of the enemy fleet and launched repeated and fierce attacks. As a result, one enemy large aircraft carrier, one small carrier, and one Type A cruiser immediately caught fire. One of them also caught fire and sank into the sea. One enemy small aircraft carrier, one battleship, and two Class B cruisers also caught fire in many places. One battleship was bombed and sunk in an instant. When the Japanese bomber formations confirmed this situation and returned to base, they also heard the sound of an enemy ship exploding near the battlefield.</p>

<h3 id="e13">A Discussion on the Great Victory in the Seas off Taiwan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Q: The enemy Americans launched this offensive in the seas off Taiwan, pouring in the main force of their Pacific Fleet in an attempt to succeed, but were jointly annihilated by the allied Japanese army and navy. Their future is very tragic, right?</p>
<p>A: The enemy Americans acted rashly this time, resulting in a fatal blow. In terms of the entire Greater East Asia War situation, it is indeed getting closer and closer to our victory. However, it is also expected that the enemy Americans will drum up their remaining forces and attempt to act recklessly again. Therefore, in order to ensure complete victory, after this great victory, we must seize the initiative of the offensive and strike the enemy again. The allied military authorities have already declared a shift from a defensive to an offensive posture on this point.</p>
<p>Q: However, we speculate that the enemy's future intentions are certainly beneficial. What do you think?</p>
<p>A: That's right. Therefore, we must analyze the enemy's purpose in launching this campaign. In simple terms, the internal purpose was Roosevelt's attempt to use news of victory as a tool for running for his fourth term as president, that is, he was willing to take risks in order to fight for personal fame and position. The external purpose was that the war on the Chinese mainland, since the successive fall of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, and the critical situation in Guilin, the Chongqing American war attempt completely failed, and they tried to open a way out in the Pacific to save the increasingly anxious situation of decline. At the same time, after occupying a few small islands, their ambitions became even greater, and they thought of getting their hands on the Philippines. However, in order to remove their worries, they first launched an offensive against Taiwan. This was the enemy American's past attempt, which has now obviously failed. As for their future intentions, the main ones are still targeting the Philippines and the Chinese mainland. However, after this defeat, they are inevitably at the end of their rope in terms of momentum.</p>
<p>Q: Although the situation is like this, the enemy Americans still have remaining forces. We must not neglect the enemy, right?</p>
<p>A: The main factor in this great victory in the seas off Taiwan was of course the result of the allied army and navy working together to exert their strength. It was by no means a lucky success. Of course, the allied authorities will certainly not neglect the enemy's remaining forces and take the enemy lightly. However, our China is a participating country, and we have an absolute responsibility to jointly strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we must further recognize that one of the enemy's biggest goals is to approach the Chinese mainland. If they were to succeed by chance, it would cause unavoidable damage and pain to the Chinese people. Therefore, we should contribute all our strength, which is directly beneficial to the victory of the war, and indirectly prevent our own damage.</p>
<p>Q: Since we have this responsibility, how should we contribute our strength?</p>
<p>A: In terms of our capabilities and environment, we do not have troops to participate in combat, but we can contribute and cooperate by enriching war resources, in order to enhance the overall strength of the war. For example, working hard to increase production and supply military materials, etc.</p>
<p>A: Recently, the general public seems unable to be optimistic about the Greater East Asia War situation. One reason is that they have been blinded by the enemy's false propaganda. Part of the reason is the loss of several small islands in the Pacific. However, due to this great victory in the Battle of Taiwan, it proves the difference in combat power between the enemy and us. Therefore, there is an opportunity to change the general public's pessimism, and the uneasy emotions can be eliminated from now on. At the same time, the enemy's false propaganda for the past year has also been exposed due to this great victory.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Japanese Army has Necessary Conditions for Victory in the Great Battle in the Eastern Seas off Taiwan; Naval Minister Ren Yuandao Expressed his Impressions Yesterday <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – After the announcement of the great war results of the Japanese army sinking and destroying 35 enemy ships in the eastern seas off Taiwan, everyone was extremely excited. The blow to the American Navy was extremely heavy. The reporter immediately asked our Naval Minister Ren Yuandao for his impressions of this naval battle. He granted an audience and said, "When I met with Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet in China a few days ago to discuss the Pacific naval war, I deeply believed that the Japanese naval war would surely defeat the American Navy, because in order to achieve victory, whether in naval, land, or air warfare, it is necessary to have conditions that are conducive to war. The so-called conditions are war principles, combat power, and morale. According to war principles, the American supply line is long and the expedition is far away, which is what military strategists fear. On the contrary, the Japanese army's supply line is short and they are waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner. This is one reason why the enemy will be defeated. In terms of combat power, although the strength of the American mobile units is large, the strength of the Japanese combined fleet in a certain area where they operate will definitely not exceed the power of that location. Their combat power is definitely not as strong as the Japanese fleet. This is the second reason why the enemy will be defeated. In terms of morale, after the battles of Saipan Island and Miyakojima Island, the morale of the American Navy is inevitably arrogant, while the Japanese Navy, due to the lessons and guidance of the naval battles of Saipan Island and other islands, is united in their hatred of the enemy. As a result, their morale is even more elevated. This is the third reason why the enemy will be defeated. With these three points, how can the American Navy not be defeated? I predicted a few days ago that the American Navy would be greatly defeated. Now that the news has come, the American Navy has indeed suffered a disastrous defeat in the seas off eastern Taiwan this time. However, after this naval victory, we people should strengthen our beliefs, work hard, and not stop until the final victory is completed. At the same time, we along the Yangtze River, all the way to Taiwan, should strengthen our defenses and cooperate with Japan, so that the Japanese naval forces can devote all their strength to the war."</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Authorities Urgently Seek Countermeasures to Suppress Rampant Price Hikes, Paying Closer Attention to the Grain Issue <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Recently, black market rice prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have soared, stimulating a general rise in prices, which has greatly affected people's livelihood. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited relevant authorities such as the Beijing Office of the Ministry of Industry's Rice Control Association to inquire about the authorities' countermeasures to this problem. The details are as follows: Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Industry stated: Question 1: Recently, black market rice prices and general prices in various places have all soared, greatly affecting people's livelihood. Is the Ministry of Industry currently devising effective countermeasures? Answer: The Ministry has been closely monitoring the price issue at all times. At the economic liaison symposium convened in Beijing at the end of last month, it was discussed in detail. Minister Chen repeatedly and earnestly instructed the attendees on price control strategies. As for the recent soaring black market rice prices, which have stimulated general prices and threatened people's livelihood, the Ministry, as its duty lies, is currently working with all relevant parties to research effective countermeasures, which will be formally decided and implemented within days to curb the rising trend and stabilize people's livelihood. However, price management should be comprehensive, not partial. Close connections and mutual responses should be established between the central and local governments, as well as between different local governments, for overall planning to be effective. Question 2: Regarding the rise in rice prices, general opinion attributes it to the insufficient rationing volume and the failure to distribute it on time. Furthermore, recently, the Rice Control Associations in both Beijing and Shanghai have strictly prohibited the free carrying of more than eight kilograms, which may benefit the authorities' purchase work. However, due to excessive restrictions, the arrival of vendors is limited, which is also one of the main reasons for stimulating the rise in black market rice prices. May I ask what the authorities are considering in this regard? Answer: The Ministry has repeatedly urged the Rice Control Association to distribute rice rations to citizens' household accounts on time, but it is regrettable that the association has ultimately failed to distribute them as scheduled. Because on the one hand, it cannot distribute household rice on time, and on the other hand, it strictly restricts the amount of rice that people can freely carry, resulting in the rise of black market rice prices, which is indeed part of the reason. If household rice can be distributed on time, it is believed that the current black market price surge can be eliminated. Therefore, we hope that the authorities of the Rice Control Association will pay attention to this point. Deputy Director Jia of the Beijing Office of the Rice Control Association said: Question 1: Recently, black market rice prices have approached the ten thousand yuan mark. General opinion attributes it to the repeated delays in rationing. How will your association, whose duty lies in this area, justify this? Answer: In the past, the Rice Control Association experienced delays in distributing rice due to transportation difficulties and the transition of new and old personnel. However, through the efforts of this office to strengthen procurement and transport to Beijing, 20,000 shi of new rice have been transported and stored in warehouses, which is sufficient for this rice distribution. Another 50,000 shi will also be transported in the near future. Therefore, for this distribution to citizens, it has been decided that the first new distribution of rice can be issued within three to five days, and the second distribution can also be continued within a month. Question 2: The authorities are delaying the distribution of household rice on the one hand, and strictly prohibiting the entry of more than one dou of rice on the other. This method may benefit your association's purchasing work, but because the source of vendors is too scarce, the city feels more and more that the supply cannot meet the demand, leading to a sharp rise in rice prices. It seems necessary to carefully consider this situation. Answer: Regarding the issue of restricting the entry of rice, the Executive Yuan has issued an order for promulgation, and the Shanghai General Association has also seriously considered this issue, but it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before a decision can be made.</p>

<p>1.  Geography</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the entire island of Taiwan is mountainous, with as many as 62 peaks over 3,000 meters. The east is mostly cliffs, while the west is entirely plains, with rivers such as the Zhuoshui River and the Dajia River flowing through them, resulting in abundant products and beautiful scenery. The Tropic of Cancer crosses the center, dividing the island into northern and southern parts. During the [typhoon season] [rainy season], the weather is very overcast, and thick fog covers the hillsides and villages, making the scenery appear extremely lush and beautiful. The mountains of Taiwan stretch across the entire island, with deep, wide streams and vast banyan forests in the mountains. The peaks are steep and consist of sheer cliffs. Plank roads are built between the peaks, resembling natural cradles. Along the coast, the mountains are even more precipitous, with towering cliffs rising 7,000 feet. Looking down from above, one can only see the raging waves, a spectacular sight. This place is known as the [World's First Cliff], and its dangerous nature can be imagined. The region is subtropical, and snowfall is rare even in winter, except in the high mountains. The temperature rarely drops below freezing, so vegetation is abundant, suitable for agriculture.</p>
<p>2.  Area and Population (1940)</p>
<p>Prefecture/Office Name Area (Square Kilometers) Population</p>
<p>Taihoku Prefecture 4,594 1,233,882</p>
<p>Shinchiku Prefecture 4,570 838,011</p>

<p>Karenko Office 4,629 153,785</p>
<p>Hoko Office 127 69,387</p>
<p>The total area of Taiwan is 35,961 square kilometers, and the total population is 6,249,468 people. Among them, there are 365,682 Japanese, 2,539 Koreans, 5,832,682 native Taiwanese, and 48,565 mainland Chinese.</p>
<p>3.  Politics and Military</p>
<p>Japan's rule over Taiwan is similar to that over Korea, with a Governor-General's Office established. There is also a Council, which serves as the Governor-General's advisory body, with the power to make suggestions to the Governor-General on important policies. The entire island is divided into five prefectures and three offices, namely Taihoku, Shinchiku, Taichu, Tainan, and Takao prefectures, and Taito, Karenko, and Hoko offices. These are further divided into eleven cities and forty-five counties, ruled by the prefectural governors, office directors, mayors, and county chiefs, respectively.</p>
<p>Taiwan's national defense includes fortresses in Keelung, Kaohsiung, and the east and west bays of Penghu Island. Garrison command headquarters are located in Taipei and Tainan, and an army command headquarters is located in Taipei City. Since 1942, a voluntary military system has been implemented, and conscription will also be implemented.</p>
<p>4.  Economy</p>
<p>Taiwan's main products are rice and sugar, while other industries are relatively underdeveloped. However, since the situation has become tense, the island's industries have shown a trend towards a wartime system, and emerging industries are particularly active. However, agriculture is still the island's main industry. About 53 percent of the island's population is engaged in it. The Taiwan Important Agricultural Industry Adjustment Committee was established in September 1938 and decided to establish a ten-year production increase plan for important agricultural products starting in 1939. In 1940, the consumption of rice within the island was controlled.</p>
<p>Taiwan's climate is ideal for rice cultivation, with two crops per year. The main production areas are Taichung, Taipei, Hsinchu, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. Half of its rice production is shipped to Japan. Sugarcane is the main product after rice, with cultivation areas throughout the island, and the total annual output is 80 million yuan. Sweet potatoes are one of Taiwan's three major agricultural products, with Tainan Prefecture as the main production area, and the annual output is 30 million yuan. In addition, tea is the island's main export product, with Taipei and Hsinchu prefectures as the main production areas. Others include jute, ramie, castor, and cotton. In terms of fruits, bananas and pineapples are the main ones.</p>
<p>Taiwan's main mineral products are placer gold, gold, copper, coal, and petroleum. Coal is the island's largest mineral product. As for petroleum, efforts are being made to develop it. Recently, wells have been successfully drilled in Jinshui and Zhudong in Hsinchu Prefecture, and in Xinying and Zhutouqi in Tainan Prefecture.</p>
<p>Taiwan's industry is centered on agricultural processing industries such as sugar and tea production. In recent years, modern industries have gradually developed. Achievements in the textile industry, chemical industry, and metal electrical industry are remarkable.</p>
<p>5.  Cities</p>
<p>Keelung Keelung is a major commercial port in Taiwan, located at the northern end of Taiwan, about 755 miles from Moji, Japan, and controls the center of the South China Sea and the East China Sea, making its position extremely important. Land and water transportation are very convenient. It can accommodate postal ships of more than 10,000 tons, and its importance is like that of Yokohama in Japan. Important Japanese transportation agencies and financial organizations operate here. The main products are fish, flour, fertilizer, coal, etc.</p>
<p>Taipei Taipei is the capital of Taiwan, where the Governor-General of Taiwan resides, and is the political, economic, cultural, and industrial center of the island. The streets in the city are crisscrossed, and the scenery is known for its beauty, earning it the nickname "[Little Paris of the Orient]". Commerce is extremely prosperous. National Taiwan University and the headquarters of the Bank of Taiwan are located here. Taipei City is adjacent to the Tamsui River to the west, the Datun Mountains and Qixing Mountain to the north, and fertile fields and vast plains to the east. Taipei City can be divided into three districts: Chengnei, Dadaocheng, and Wanhua. Chengnei is the residence of the Japanese, and various political, economic, and cultural facilities are readily available. Dadaocheng is the residence of the native Taiwanese and is the commercial area of the city. The transaction of rice and tea is mostly centered here. Wanhua is the oldest street in the city and is now just a bustling area.</p>
<p>Hsinchu Hsinchu, formerly known as Zhqian, was a desolate land inhabited by indigenous people. In 1734, Chinese merchant ships had already arrived at Zhqian Port, making it the cultural center of western Taiwan. It is still a major city in Taipei and is Taiwan's sugar-producing region.</p>
<p>Taichung Taichung is equivalent to Kyoto in Japan and is the central metropolis of Taiwan. It is also a major production area for Taiwan rice and bananas. The streets are quite clean and tidy, earning it the nickname "Healthy City".</p>
<p>Chiayi Chiayi is the industrial center of Taiwan, with railways extending in all directions, making it a distribution center for goods. The city streets are beautiful, and industry is developed. Most of the sugar factories are located here. The lumber mill operated by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is so large that it is called "[The First in the Far East]".</p>
<p>Tainan Tainan is the oldest metropolis in Taiwan, which is the capital of the Zheng dynasty for three generations. Since the Qing dynasty took possession of Taiwan, Tainan has been the capital for more than 300 years. After the Japanese took over, the capital was moved to Taipei, and this area has become the second most prosperous cultural city on the island.</p>
<p>Kaohsiung Kaohsiung City is the only good harbor in southern Taiwan. Mount Shoushan and the Qihou Peninsula control its port, preventing ocean-going steamships from entering and exiting freely. From here to Fuzhou is only 34 miles, Xiamen 156 miles, Shantou 250 miles, Hong Kong 325 miles, and Guangzhou 405 miles. Access to the ports of Southeast Asia is, of course, extremely convenient. Therefore, it occupies a very important position in terms of industrial economy, and is particularly valued militarily.</p>
<p>Pingtung Pingtung City, located at the southern end of Taiwan, is not only an industrial city but also the first line of national defense in the south for Japan. Japan has an air unit stationed here. The agricultural products here are also quite abundant, with abundant production of sugarcane, bananas, papayas, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Intensify Traffic Control During Air Raid Alarms <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Police Bureau Orders Strict Enforcement in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>The city's police bureau, in view of the traffic control regulations issued during air raid alarms, previously promulgated by the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command in Special Order No. 4, has recently found that traffic control is extremely lax when alarms are issued. Especially when an air raid alarm is first issued, all kinds of vehicles, whether cars, pedicabs, rickshaws, bicycles, or other vehicles, rush ahead, or pull and drag. This tense and chaotic situation greatly hinders the entire air defense activity. In order to ensure complete traffic control, the police bureau has instructed all sub-bureaus to instruct their subordinates to strictly enforce the regulations. Whenever an air raid alarm is issued, all kinds of vehicles, except those with a traffic permit, should be ordered to stop immediately, and should be dispersed and reorganized, so that they can be parked on the roadside for shelter, and must be separated from road corners, water hydrants, and bridges by a considerable distance, so as to strengthen traffic control and maintain safety.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Great Victory in Taiwan Sea Battle Comparable to Russo-Japanese War <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Takeuchi Fuminobu Expresses His Thoughts</p>
<p>The announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters of the destruction of the enemy's U.S. fleet in the sea off eastern Taiwan has shocked all parties, Chinese, Japanese, and foreign, in Shanghai. Mr. Takeuchi Fuminobu, managing director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, issued a statement expressing his gratitude for the victory and his determination for the future. He said: "This naval battle off the eastern coast of Taiwan can be said to be comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. The decisive results of the Battle of Tsushima at that time... After receiving this victory, I immediately considered two points. First, the arrogant will not last long. Second, the 1 billion people of East Asia have now fully demonstrated their East Asian strength.</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Arrogant Will Not Last Long <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>To give one example, when attacking Okinawa a few days ago, the enemy's mobile unit was smoking and adding shells, completely revealing the original face of the United States, which relies solely on material quantity and despises Japan. The so-called 'the arrogant will not last long,' Halsey, who attempted to land in Taiwan this time, is a representative American. This time, the U.S. Pacific Fleet's attack on Taiwan is a representative work of blind advance. This victory strengthens the belief in victory among the 100 million Japanese people, implements the general mobilization of production first and economy first, and the domestic system becomes more and more consolidated, and the whole country unites and moves forward to the final assault battle. Also, the allied Chinese friends will increasingly recognize the strengthening of East Asian strength, and the determination to truly practice the unity of China and Japan and move towards the formation of a new East Asia is imminent. The 1 billion people of East Asia should unite as one and rise up to defeat Britain and the United States. The fact that Okakura Tenshin advocated more than 30 years ago in Asia, the so-called '[gathering together] is approaching the eve of true establishment.' Whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an, after receiving this war report, they will also think that they should get rid of the evil path of East Asian rebels today and take the attitude of the East Asian Avenue. This decisive victory also has a great impact on Europe. The expressions of Stalin, Hitler, and Chiang Kai-shek can be imagined. Thanks to this decisive battle, it can be felt that the war has been 80% resolved, but what should be concerned about in the future is the remaining task beyond 80%, which should be carried out with a humble attitude, front and rear.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Unified Effort <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Among them, the most necessary is the production war. Aircraft, ships, and weapons, corresponding to the rear's production war, are the only way to expand the results of the war and defeat the enemy. In the Taiwan Sea Battle and the currently unfolding Philippine Sea Battle, the fact that Japan combines the [quality] and [quantity] of the production war is shown to the world. We should be aware that we must adhere to the economic war and the production war until the last five minutes. Even more important is the ideological war. The people of China and Japan have recognized the strength of East Asia and have nothing to fear from Britain and the United States. Shanghai is the most important ideological war decisive battleground in the world war. Today, we must establish an ideological war system and establish the ideological state of East Asia's victory and Britain and the United States' destruction. Because of its position in the Battle of Tsushima, Japan has been elevated to the world's Japan. East Asia has become the world's East Asia due to this new Battle of Tsushima. East Asia has only one East Asia, and it must not become a British and American slave. It is now the autumn of 1 billion people uniting as one and striving to liberate East Asia."</p>
<h3 id="e28">China Communications and Other Banks Lend a Total of 500 Million Yuan for Autumn Cocoon Purchases <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>This year in the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, autumn cocoons have been put on the market, and silk reeling factories have been purchasing them in the producing areas. The Silk Industry Association of the Silk Industry Association believes that silk factories urgently need funds when purchasing autumn cocoons, so it borrowed 500 million yuan from the China Communications and other banking groups to lend to silk factories for the purchase of autumn cocoons. After several discussions between the Silk Industry Association and representatives of the banking group and the China Communications Bank authorities, it was determined that the two parties would sign the autumn cocoon loan contract today (17th). It is now known that the loan includes 250 million yuan borrowed by the China Silk Industry Company, 50 million yuan provided by the Dali Silk Industry Company, and the remaining loans are managed and lent by the Silk Industry Association to members of silk factories in various regions. The banks participating in the loan include China, Communications, Huaxing, Continental, Jincheng, Guohua, Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Zhejiang Shi and more than 20 other large banks.</p>

<p>Minister Matsudaira Discusses Impressions of Returning Home: Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy recently returned to Shanghai after a four-week business trip to Japan. Yesterday (the 16th) at 2:30 PM, the embassy held its regular press conference. Minister Matsudaira gladly attended with Vice-Consul Fukuma and met with Chinese reporters from this city. Minister Matsudaira immediately gave his impressions of returning home, noting the completion of the national decisive battle system, the unified cooperation of the entire nation, and the flourishing spirit of selflessness and public service. He gave a detailed speech elaborating on this. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e47">The People Are United in Selflessness and Public Service <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Minister Matsudaira stated: First, [I returned home on business this time, with a liaison mission. I stayed in the country for four weeks and only recently returned to Shanghai. I was very pleased to see the completion of the national decisive battle system. In particular, the firm belief in victory has filled the hearts of every citizen at all levels. Whether young, middle-aged, or elderly women, all are enthusiastically inspired by the spirit of decisive battle. I am deeply moved by the vigorous spirit of selflessness and public service, and by the progress being made towards increasing war power. At the same time, the mood of the entire nation is bright and pure, full of the spirit of Yamato that the current cabinet has proclaimed, which is even more gratifying. In addition, in the various stages and aspects of the nation, there is a surge of constructive comments, and the female employees in government offices and companies are skilled and approachable to the general public. Furthermore, there is a spirit of reform in the hearts of all levels of the people, such as the donation of military supplies, which are offered voluntarily and sincerely, with excellent results. However, because the people are actively donating, and there are abundant supplies, the staff in charge of handling them are extremely busy and unable to divide themselves, which is truly a good phenomenon. At this difficult time for the country, the people have naturally and deeply activated the spirit of our great Yamato nation. At the same time, I deeply feel that the entire nation is aware of this war of liberation, which, in terms of geography, history, and bloodline, unites all the peoples of Greater East Asia and seeks the development of all ethnic groups, aiming to achieve a new life, standing shoulder to shoulder with the countries of Greater East Asia in a common struggle.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The People's Diligence Is Admirable <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The feelings of affection among the Japanese people in Shanghai and across East Asia towards the people of Greater East Asia continue to increase sharply, and the concern for all ethnic groups is particularly profound, no different from the attitude of fraternal brotherhood. This was not the case before the Greater East Asia War. In recent years, there has been a complete transformation to loving kindness and enthusiasm. Secondly, what I feel most happy about is that all parts of the country possess a thorough spirit of [national diligence], exerting all their strength, uniting as one, and completing the great miracle of the era. Last autumn, a certain place dispatched a labor corps of 350 people to build wooden ships. Upon arrival at the destination, there were no facilities, only a few reed huts. Unexpectedly, the labor corps members were indomitable. Under the guidance of the supervisors, the whole group worked together as one, tirelessly, with a spirit of shared hardship, first building a shipyard. By September of this year, no less than eighty wooden ships had been built. Currently, a large shipyard has been completed, and there are more than 5,000 workers. What I saw there was unexpected. The first batch of labor corps members were all criminals serving sentences in prison. I personally witnessed various situations in the country. Upon returning to Shanghai, there were still many unfinished matters piled up.] Finally, the minister added: [Given this situation, in order to build and establish a system for certain victory, both China and Japan should fully recognize and understand each other and fully promote specific policies, which is a very urgent need.]</p>

<h3 id="e49">Mr. Xu Chengyu's Memorial Gifts Transferred to Charity <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengyu of Dantu, a merchant in Shanghai, started from humble beginnings through diligence and thrift. He possessed a kind and compassionate nature and enjoyed doing good deeds. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly this autumn at the age of forty-four. The news of his death was met with regret by all who heard it. On the sixth of this month, his family held a memorial service and sutra chanting at Huguo Temple, inviting Grand Historian Qian Cinian to be the chief mourner. Mr. Chengyu had extensive social connections during his lifetime, and on that day, many groups and friends attended, with simple carriages and white horses, showing the utmost respect. Now, his family has taken the memorial gifts from relatives and friends, combined them into a total of 115,000 yuan, and donated them to charity and Buddhist organizations to comfort Mr. Chengyu's spirit. They have entrusted Hu Songnian and Yang Xinlian, two lay Buddhists from the Buddhist Benevolent Society, to deliver the donations separately. The list of donations to various organizations is as follows: Shanghai Shenbao Primary School Teachers Medical Aid Fund, Xinwenbao Orphan Fund, Shanghai Buddhist Pure Land Society, Pure Land Orphanage, Buddhist Infant Protection Home, Pure Land Society Charity Department, Buddhist Benevolent Society, Buddhist Benevolent Society Clinic, Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Buddhist Winter Relief Association, Cilian Relief Association, Anyang Nianfo Hall, Buddhist Quarterly, Shanghai Western Temple, Pudong Jiangjing Nunnery, Northern Jiangsu Elderly Home, Hangzhou Jieyi Nunnery, Lingyin Fahua Retreat, Women and Children's Relief Association, Lingtai Mountain Congee Kitchen, Wutai Mountain Gunan Terrace, National Medical People's Hospital, Shanghai Chinese Education Moral Association. Each of the above twenty-three places will receive 5,000 yuan, totaling 115,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Donating Small Capital Loans Has Profound Significance <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of our office's small capital loan program is to help the poor by providing them with opportunities to make a living. Anyone who wants to run a small business but lacks capital can apply to our office for registration, repaying the principal once a month in ten installments without interest. Therefore, donating to small capital loans is both charitable and helps alleviate unemployment, which is of profound significance. Yesterday, we received donations from the Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Exhibition, Ruifeng Company, Qin Jinrong, Yang Chuanliang, Cai Tongfu, and anonymous donors, either through commission from charity sales or from their earnings. We are deeply grateful and would like to express our sincere gratitude to the poor who will benefit on their behalf.</p>

<p>The Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Association, located at No. 6, Lane 102, South end of Weihaiwei Road, Zhengyang Road (ie Tongfu Road) in this city, has been operating a National Medicine Clinic and providing medical care and medicine for more than a year since it was established last summer, and the results have been very good. The clinic's consultation time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. Regardless of whether they are fellow villagers or not, as long as they bring their citizen ID card, they can go for medical treatment, and the extremely poor are given medicine for free.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Pay Attention When Buying Small Light Bulbs <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities have repeatedly implemented power saving measures, general electricity users have switched to small wattage light bulbs to save on electricity bills. However, recently, the market has discovered small wattage light bulbs with altered appearances and inaccurate manufacturing. According to investigations, initially, 15-watt filaments were used for manufacturing. However, because 15-watt filaments have gradually become scarce, 25-watt filaments have been used instead. General users only know that the light bulb head number matches, but they do not know that the filament content has increased several times, so the power consumption is several times higher than before. Therefore, when purchasing light bulbs, users must choose carefully and not be penny-wise and pound-foolish, or they will regret it. At the same time, it is hoped that the electrical authorities in this city will severely crack down on these substandard small wattage light bulbs. Electrical manufacturers must have their bulbs inspected before they are allowed to be sold, so that users are not deceived and the power consumption is not subjected to unexpected losses. (A User) ○ Save Envelopes and Stationery: Dafeng Art Paper Shop on Henan Road has recently released a type of [Bao's Envelope Stationery]. The method of making it is that one side is stationery, and after folding, it becomes an envelope, which is both economical and convenient. It combines envelopes and stationery in one, which is truly a saving method. ○ Fang Shen's Painting Exhibition: Fang Shen, a painter from Hefei and a master of gold needle acupuncture, has saved countless lives. In addition to his medical duties, he has devoted himself to painting and is deeply appreciated by art circles. Recently, he exhibited more than a hundred of his masterpieces at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association. The exhibition is full of beautiful works and orders are enthusiastically placed. ○ Shanghai Bibliography Consignment Society: The Shanghai Bibliography Consignment Society, founded by book expert Lin Side and others, aims to preserve and circulate wartime classics. Since its establishment, many people from all walks of life have gone to entrust the matching and transfer of books. If anyone is unclear about the consignment procedures, they can directly go to the Society at No. 4, Lane 613, Pushi Road (near Dumei Road) to read the brochure and fill out the consignment form to facilitate the processing. ○ Lost and Found: Someone picked up a bunch of keys on the street across from Hu Qingyu Hall Pharmacy on Beijing Road and sent them to our office to be claimed.</p>

<p>[That beast!] Longfu unconsciously blurted out this sentence. The reason why Longfu was angry was that Zhi knew of Shinato's death and [was not particularly saddened]. (Then, Shinato was not her intended husband? Even if Shinato himself did not know about such a marriage, the parents had already agreed to it!) Shinato had already died, but Zhi did not shed a single tear. What a heartless woman! Zhi must have returned to her old ways of acting rashly. Although Longfu knew she was his sister, he despised her behavior and stopped writing to her. Zhi did the same and stopped writing to Longfu. Before, the two of them liked to write to each other, writing at least two or three letters a month. But after Shinato's death, neither of them wrote. One day, a colleague asked him about this matter. This colleague was planning to write biographies of nine martyrs. [Hey, will Major Gu be engaged?] [Uh, I haven't heard of it.] [Is there such news, that after being engaged, the engagement was terminated due to the major's death?] [There is no such thing!] [Then, could there be a woman secretly thinking about the major without him knowing? Among the childhood friends in the hometown, is there such a person?] [No, not a single one!] Longfu raised his voice loudly, startling the colleague who wanted to write a detailed biography. But when Longfu calmed down a little and thought about it, he realized that his hope of becoming Shinato's sworn brother had finally become a pipe dream. Terminating an engagement after being engaged was undoubtedly nonsense, but thinking of Shinato's personality and spirit, he felt that he had such a style. (It's good that Zhi's thoughts were not made known to Shinato.) Shinato has already become a martyr. He will forever be a twenty-three-year-old naval major. And he will forever be a virgin hero. In every way, he is worthy of praise. Everything about Shinato is beautiful. When Longfu thought of this, he felt relieved. (151)</p>

<p>Cries for Food, Please Donate Generously</p>
<p>Goal: 5,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Period: October 10th to November 10th</p>
<p>Collection Location: This newspaper's Social Service Department</p>
<p>Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday</p>
<p>Before the incident, the Shanghai Elderly Home had never had such difficulty in receiving donations or such large expenses. Therefore, the elderly in the home were given two meals and one porridge a day, all made with white rice. However, as the environment changed and it became difficult to provide for them, they gradually changed to two porridges and one meal. Recently, the economic situation has become even worse, and even this cannot be sustained, so they have switched to mixing mountain potatoes, beans, wheat, and other grains into the food. Although it is not very suitable for the elderly, they have to force themselves to eat it. The sight of them crying for food is truly pitiful. Therefore, what we seek from society is broad sympathy and strong support. We hope that charitable people will be eager to donate, so that the elderly can live out their lives in dignity. What good fortune that would be!</p>
