<h3 id="c1">通貨．物價．統制問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本內閣顧問兼大東亞省，大藏省暨日本銀行顧問結城　太郎氏，爲考察中國經濟，專程來華，本報會於二十一日發表了一封致結城顧問的公開信，現在想再就具體的經濟問題，向結城顧問提供一些意見，或可作考察中國經濟事情的參考。結城顧問是日本財政經濟界有數的代表人物，服務於日本金融界達數十年，在日本財政金融界具重要地位。他現在雖已辭去日本銀行總裁，但是以內閣顧問及大東亞省大藏省顧問等資格參與決戰金融經濟的策劃工作。這樣重要的人物來華考察，我們自當致十二分的歡迎。況且目前正值我們經濟，財政，金融各方面困難重要之際，對結城顧問的期待，也非常殷切。見於結城顧問的幾次談話，雖詞意簡短，但其關心中國經濟，　見十分誠摯。因此想在這裏簡要地再向結城顧問提出下列三點意見：　　首先因爲結城顧問對於處理金融問題中最重要的通貨問題，經驗特　。日本通貨之始終得以相當穩定，得力於結城顧問調度者殊多；對於不無膨脹趨勢而不易收縮的中國通貨問題，是大東亞戰爭的勝利所　的問題的一環，所以希望結城顧問能籌畫出一個適當得對策。中國通貨是否膨脹問題，會引起過各方的討論，但是由於戰時特殊用途所需，不無膨脹之感。同時又由於政局的不穩定，重物輕幣的心理，成爲普遍現象。從而物價愈高，影響國家財政及民間生活以及一切經濟事情的正常行進，實非淺　。如果任其發張下去，危險實大，所以如何安定中國通貨，要請結城顧問予以協助。是七日結城顧問在滬答覆新聞記者問話時，曾說：［所謂通貨膨脹，由於通貨之需要而言。］但我們覺得不正常德需要，實非　加緊縮合限制不可。否則，倘使物價漲，籌碼需要大，通貨無限制地隨此需要而增發，以致物價更漲，如次循環下去，則終有不可設想的一天。　　第二，物價問題現已成爲各種經濟問題的核心，甚至是政治問題的一部。結城顧問於十七日談話中夜說：［現下上海第一個問題是物價問題］。結城顧問認爲［戰時物價若干程度的上漲是勢所難免，果能抑止投機囤積等攪亂經濟行爲，其上漲或不致使民生甚感痛苦之程度］。我們不想忽視投機囤積的爲害，然而所講投機囤積乃是寄生的，如果不是物資太少通貨太多，以及政治機構太不健全，我們相信，投機囤積是無法立足的。所以於從事取締投機囤積之際，基本上更須設法增進生產以充裕物資；收縮通貨以相對的抑低物價；健全政治機構，以利經濟設施的推行。這些，需要日本協助的地方很多。其中增進生產尤爲要著，而確保資材，培養勞力，舒暢運輸以及改善治安等，乃是增進生產或維護生產的基礎條件。　　第三，關於經濟統制問題，戰時需要統制是母庸多言的。不過統制的施行，必須合理而適度。這雖是老生常談、但目前在中國的經濟統制，需要改進的地方實在很多。不僅國與國之間實際環境有所不同，有時即地與地之間的實際環境也各異。如行之於甲的強行於乙，或難免有畫虎不成的惡劣結果，十七日結城顧問的談話中也有說：［統制乃有限界，非任何均可實行，必按照國情時代環境而定］。所以，不適合國情，時代，環境，以及影響人民生活過甚的統制辦法，非予以徹底改善不可。又現行中國經濟統制也像政治差不多，傾向分治主義，也是重大的缺憾。多頭統制結果，往往會造成互相牽制甚至相互傾軋的弊端，影響健全統制施策的遂行很大。所以如何使統制辦法合理而適度，如何使統制機構單純化，應請結城顧問特別致力相助。　　我們就目前中國經濟中最　重的通貨問題，物價問題，統制問題申論如上。希望結城顧問於回國之後，把前述幾點轉達於日本有關當局及朝野人士，予以重視。　　○東京二是二日中央社電　日本大營十月二十一日下午四時發表：日航空部隊於十九日及二十日對企圖侵入雷伊泰灣之敵船團及獲術部隊加以攻擊，收穫戰果如次：擊沉敵大型運輸船一艘，驅逐艦一艘，擊破敵運輸船一艘，航空母艦兩艘，及戰艦兩艘。　　○東京二是二日中央社電　據西南太平洋基地電，白晝有敵Ｂ２４型機二十架，來　民答那峨島撈卯市，當經該方面日軍邀擊，計共擊落其六架。　　○里斯本二十二日中央社電　據美聯社消息：擔當雷伊泰島登陸之</p>
<p>美軍登陸用船四艘及小型舟　數艘，已爲日軍沿岸砲及迫擊擊砲沉。又傳克爾加麾下登陸軍，遭日軍強烈抵抗，同時日軍之抵抗力已形強大。印度洋英艦動仰光三度遭空襲</p>
<p>○理斯本二是二日中央社電　據　訊，東南亞洲軍司令部二十二日發表戰報，內稱：東亞艦隊（包括戰艦航空母艦十數艘）已本於週在尼科巴城展開作戰，對該　島嶼進攻。　　○緬甸前綫日軍基地廿二日中央社電　仰光地區二十日又有敵Ｐ４７Ｐ５１Ｐ３８型戰鬥機六十八架三度來襲，日戰鬥機隊及陸上部隊對之迎擊，展開激烈空戰，擊落Ｐ３８型機四架（內二架未證實）擊毀Ｐ５１型Ｐ４７型機四架，並予其他機多架以相當損害而將其擊退。是役日機一架自炸，又陸上所害極輕微。</p>

<p>○中央社京訊　敵美軍在菲律賓雷伊泰島登陸消息傳出後，此間各界一致表示深切關心。對於今後該方面戰局之推移，尤爲重視。敵軍圍奪回菲島作戰既於此展開，其將孤注一擲拼力作戰，乃在意料之中，為確信菲島日軍已早有堅強之防衛態勢，必能打擊敵軍予以重創。但綜觀太平洋上之戰局，其情勢重大，實亦不能否認。是故就中國而言，當此戰局殿重之狀，凡圍國人，尤應加強奮起，增強協力戰爭之體制，良以中國之獨立自由，必須以東亞完成解放爲前提，茍東亞仍爲英美所制嚂，則不僅東亞永無解放之日，即一國之復與繁榮，亦將完全絕望。故吾人於此實可謂已臨與廢存亡關頭。吾人爲求中國之生存與獨立，爲求東亞之自由與解放，必須立即傾舉全國總力，與東亞各國家各民族緊密協力，以必勝之決心，奮起擊滅英美。今日雷伊泰島之戰事，決非僅爲日本及菲律賓兩國之事，實乃爲東亞十億人民之生死激戰，故除痛擊敵軍，粉碎其反攻企圖外，實無他危之時，凡屬真正愛護吾中華祖國之人士，必能以同仇敵愾之義氣，堅強不属之決心，加緊奮發，貢獻全力於國家民族，以擊滅敵人，確保吾國之永久的獨立與自由，從而貢獻於東亞之繁榮，中國之將來，即將於此決定。吾中國人民自當以加倍的努力，保持五千年來之歷史的光榮，使能永久於世界。芳澤大使發表感想</p>
<p>○西貢二十二日中央社電　松平外務次官繼任日駐越南特派大使後，前任芳澤大使二十一日晚在官邸招待記者，暢述駐越南三年來之回憶，其大意謂：在河內設立大使館已三年，本人到任之時，適值大東亞戰爭勃發該地當時乃成爲作戰基地及兵站基地，在軍事上佔重要地位。本人雖薄材徽力，然相信尚無大過，大使館之事務已上軌道，本人得安心離去，在河內及西貢曾與德古總督作各種議論，一切均甚圓滿。日國民運動應注意三點</p>
<p>褚方總裁之見解　　○東京二是二誒中央社電　日情報局總裁兼冀贊會總裁褚方氏，二十一日在冀贊會全國支部事務局長會議席上致辭，就日政府冀贊會　政會三方面此次行將實施之［全國奮起寂滅英美運動］開陳所見，力言一本運動應將其基調置於國體精神之實現。二推進運動時，應盡其誘導國民之力，使全體國民根據其自發之意志，積極且自然參加寂滅英美運動。三運動實施時，應盡其一切方法與努力，避免表面上之形式，而後精神上努力發展國家業務。並力盼冀贊會與各所屬例體，充分發揮其機動力，向達成站下使命之途邁進。印臨時政府成立一週年</p>
<p>○昭南二是二日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府自於昭南鑄建以來，迄今已滿一年，二十一日恰爲意義深長之週年紀念日，是日昭南至印度國民軍齊集兵營，上午十時半舉行閱兵式，嗣後以機械部隊當先，遊行市內，贑示威　。四時半昭南之印度寺院舉行祈禱獨立，六時半更在大東亞　塲，舉行盛大民眾大會。京日總領事館開警署長會議</p>

<p>○日軍前綫某基地二十二日中央社　電桂林飛行塲，因渝軍不堪日軍陸上部隊之重壓，現已自動將飛機塲設施破壞，滿地洞穴，一如荒野，顯示出其愭伏於日軍猛功之末路。據日機從事偵察桂林防空要塞時所見現狀談稱，桂林第一飛機塲（在桂林</p>
<p>市外西南十三公里）之補助滑走路，長約一百五十米，幅寬約百米之滑走路，但目下則每隔百米惻有巨穴，殆爲炸毀者，自塞中觀察之，大穴不下七處。又滑走路誘導路或連絡道路，亦每隔百米乃至二百米，惻有巨穴，又向日倂行之重要滑走路，（長）目下似尚未破壞，現美空軍似以其爲戰鬥機之機動飛機塲，此處或不久亦將遭破壞也。主要滑走路兩側之建築物，則幾盡行破壞。第二飛機塲已完全</p>
<p>遭破壞，主要滑走路（長約二千米寬約二百米）之間隔間現炸成四大洞，深度頗深，情狀極爲淒涼，聯絡路誘導路之末端，亦均有無敷洞空。桂林第三飛機塲（第二飛機塲兩側）主要滑走路，（長約廿米寬約九米，）亦有二十五六處巨穴，桂林航空要塞現已化爲荒野廢墟矣。華北軍事考察團北返</p>

<p>○柏林二是二日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在巴爾幹續閰自東面打通至西面以與蒂托遊擊隊聯絡，并切斷巴爾幹南部之德軍，戰事重心之貝爾格勒區現仍在惡戰中。蘇軍似極重視巴爾幹前綫之本冀在該處集中軍隊甚多，蘇軍對摩拉瓦河下游壓力加強，對尼斯與貝爾格勒區間爲尤甚。保軍自尼斯區向西南推進，戰事在普洛　浦伊及克拉爾伏．傑克拉格傑伐克一帶進行中。洪境戰局僅有寫微變化，蘇軍向泰斯河迤西之多瑙河推進，德軍則像索爾諾克東南突進。德軍自在洪牙利東部進行避離運動後，自華沙迤南至斯洛伐克東疆現亦開始避離，故華沙與貝爾格勒戰線可獲引直。　　○柏林二是二日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍事發言人稱，東普魯士希斯之北，被蘇軍突破，此乃局勢唯一值改變，德軍反攻，使蘇軍無法擴大其突破點。那萊夫區之大進攻尚未開始，星期五蘇軍損失坦克車八十九輛，可見戰事之猛烈。邱吉爾重視英美蘇友誼</p>
<p>○百倫二十二日中央社電　德國社訊：局交換電訊報由莫斯科報告稱，英首相邱吉爾於未離莫斯科之前，曾於英大使館閱書室接見英美蘇三國記者，邱氏稱，反軸心國對對德作戰之戰略，意見已全趨一致，非但軍事計劃，即重要政治問題亦已傾釋明白。至於波瀾，渠與任何反軸心國之政治家，殊不顧使之成爲反軸心國政策中痛心之事。邱氏於結論中暗示，於另以祥細之會議中，羅斯福總統有參加之必要。據交換電訊報云，邱氏顯欲於該報道會議中，特別重視英美蘇增進友誼，實爲世界繁榮之關鍵之事實。英外相艾登亦曾出席該報道會。荷境加軍增援發動新攻勢</p>
<p>○柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社訊：荷境加拿大軍於安特衛普－羅遜特爾公路與透恩霍特－布萊達公路之間猛攻，遍該處戰事進入新階段。大致而論，加軍攻勢已被阻，缺口正堵截中。加軍此一攻勢，目的在包抄沿海德軍陣地，並擴大尼美根橋頭堡，同時並呼應切斷貝雜蘭半島之行動，敵人更望佔領杜特萊許南之荷蘭許迪普（ＨｏｌｌａｎｄｓｃｈＤｉｅｐ）以控制萊茵．普士爾河河口。及河口之半島。蘇島，斷絕該處德軍之陸上供應。</p>

<p>黑人的增加</p>
<p>黑人最密集的州爲面臨東南大西洋與摩西哥灣的南加路列那，喬其亞，佛羅烈達，阿拉巴瑪，密西西比，路易西那，阿貫索，及德克薩斯八州，均爲比較溫暖的土地。這八州居有　　一八二○年　　一八四○年　　一八六○年　　一八八○年　　一九○○年　　一九二○年　　一九三○年　　黑人人口的增加，實爲美國人最大的威脅。但現在居住於美國的黑人，約五分之一之七分之一，可說與白種人混血。又達蒲斯博士以美國最古德黑人殖民地喬其亞州的黑人爲中心，另加他州的調查資料而加以檢討，據報告稱：全部黑人人口至少約三分之一爲與白人的混全美黑人的約半數以上，約六百萬人。南加路列那及密西西比二州，黑人人口竟超過白人。路易西那州黑白人口各半，他們的生產率非常高，美國人口之迅速增加者，實爲黑人。　　過去百年間黑人人口的增加狀態如左：一，七七一，六五六二，八七三，六四八四，四四一，八三○六，五八○，七九三八，八三三，九九四一○，四六三，一三一一一，八九一，一四三血兒。總之，因氣候，風土，食物的關係，與混血的結果，黑人的膚色已漸漸改變過來了，這是事實。　　我在美國時，曾在加州奈柏有名的瘋癲醫院視察日本病人的收容狀態，彼時，由於勃拉特萊醫師的說明，見到一個黑人的狂人，那黑人與黑人街上所常見的黑人不同，索然同樣是黑的臉色，但非常鮮豔，黑光閃閃，鼻大而發光，鼻腔廣而寬，頭髮鬒曲，唇紅，齒大而白。名字呌皮比，爲純粹的非洲人，據醫師的說明，與從前作爲奴隸而聯入南部地方黑人種同種，現在這種黑人極少　　皮比爲哈利華有名的電影監督威廉泰勒的汽車駕駛員，泰勒殺死了某人，事件的真相不明，以皮比最知道當時，擎而發狂，我們會與談話，他似乎尚有餘悸，應答時聲音發抖。黑人的職業</p>
<p>黑人大多深於情愛，順從而臨命，除非被酒與色慾　激，不傲十分殘酷的事，且亦不固執。智力雖差，但頗有小聰明。且有些像原始人，小孩子，缺乏自制心。善感動，喜音樂。南部的黑人，多數從事棉花，烟草，米，砂糖　　從事農業者　　從事山林及漁業者，　　礦上勞動者　　工業方面勞動者　職工　　　　　　　　　　技術者　　交通方面運檢者　　從事商業者　　公共事業勞働者　　自由職業者　　宗教家　　合計　　　又十大工業中心地　　　紐約　　　支架哥　　　費拉特爾費亞　　　第德洛　　　克利扶蘭　　　聖路易　　　舉茲派克　　　新西西蒂　　　印第安那波里斯　　　康薩斯西蒂待遇的差別</p>
<p>在南部褚州，定下了種種對黑人的差別的州法。例如，統稱爲舊姆，克勞的法律，將黑人與白人列車來區別，等的產生。新的統計無從獲得，據較舊的統計，黑人的職業分野如左：　一，九八七，八三九　　　　三一，七三二　　　　七四，九七三　一，○二四，六五六　　　三九七，六四五　　　一八三，八○三　　　　五○，二○三　一，五七六，二○五　　　　四○，五四九　五，五○三，五三五黑人人口的分布狀態如左：二二七，七○六二三三，九○三二二九，五九九一二○，○六六　七一，八九九　九三，五八○　五四，九八三　四三，九六七　三八，五七四黑人乘客無論怎樣混雜，雖白人列車空空如也，黑人也決不能乘白人的列車。又電車上也將黑人席與白人席分開。理髮店，酒館，也劃然區別，旅館不許黑人投宿。白人與黑人結婚，當然在嚴禁之列。對這不平等的法律，據美國人所稱：白人即欲與黑人結婚，又黑人即欲與白人結婚，雙方都不可，這樣始稱公平。然實際上欲與白人結婚的黑人或許有，欲與黑人結婚的白人，則除了白癡狂漢以外，絕無僅有，結果，這當然是對黑人的差別待遇。本來，不管黑人也好，白人也好，現在同是美國的市民，且賦與同等的選舉權與被選舉權，所以禁止同樣是市民的結婚，用然達反應法。但白人自種種手段，使這不合法行爲合法化。如本文最初所引證的黑人對白人的鬥爭，以前不一而足。一九一七年，發生於聖路易城的人種戰，殺死了三十九個黑人與八個白人。又在一九一九年，黑白人的爭鬥事件達二十六件。其中最激烈者，爲發生于美國肖都華盛頓與芝加哥的人種戰。其原因因爲參加第一次歐洲大戰而歸來的黑人部隊，白人依然加以差別待遇，乃表示憤慨而突然發生反對運動。（未完）</p>

<p>姜校长暨臨田大尉演講</p>
<p>上海新聞聯合會暨工商聯議會市民福利協會所召開之［掃蕩美英艦隊預祝會］，作爲第二日，計劃到主席國船津長一郞。許力求。陳彬酥金雄白．黃敬齋．魯風．日高清磨瑳甖總幹事任雲鵬等，首由新聯會值月主席理事黃敬齋致開會辭，　請中央海軍學校校長姜西園及盟邦駐華艦隊報導部　田大尉演講，詞意警惕，聽者動容。最後放映海戰新聞片及華影新片［重逢］，直至下午七時半始散。今爲最後一天，仍在大光明舉行，由出淵陸軍報導部長及新聯會值月主席理事黃敬齋爾氏主講，並有上海交　樂團演奏，中日名歌星演唱會。姜校長演詞</p>
<p>略講吾等之敵人－美國－正想藉其海軍之勢力以遂其侵略之野心，而傲慢無態的想向日本本土接近的時候，盟邦日本之海軍必能具有殲敵之決心，而將其進攻之企圖粉碎。日本之海軍必能戰勝，約有下列諸端：必勝因素一日本海軍具有足以壓制敵人之戰略及戰術。二指揮日本海軍之統帥有堅苦卓絕及不動搖之精神。三日本海對內綫作戰有充分之準備，戰力十分強靸，敵美欲將此強靸壁壘突破，實不可能。四日本海軍之主力艦隊完整無傷，現乃伺窺敵之弱點，以圖一擊而殲滅之。五爲應乎日本海軍之無敵精神，必將激起其後方一億生產力之發揮。此次出擊之敵美太平洋艦隊，即敵美所誇稱之太平洋美國名譽機動部隊之精銳，已於十月十二日彼盟邦海軍殲滅其大半，實堪稱爲大東亞戰爭開始以來最大之戰果，吾人對此戰果不免生若幹感想。尤其是我們現在更應該重視的事實，以日本海軍此次之戰果，而對此後之戰勢，已使造成所謂更較稱極的大轉換之契機之點。於此點實在是值得我們所同慶的。（中略）然大東亞戰爭之勝利，決非飽食暖衣無爲而可獲得，前綫將兵之奮鬥，實有賴於後方之激動，今後應如何　始能加強前後兩方之緊密協力，吾人必須以不屈不撓的勇氣，與至上的熱情，來換取這最後的勝利不可。吾人必須針對大東亞解放之理想，從今以後，誓與盟邦之戰果相乎應而猛往邁進。</p>
<h3 id="c6">臨田大尉詞 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>臨田大尉即席演講述［如何獲得大戰果］，原詞如下：　　餘乘此次機會將台灣東方之大勝利略作論述，實爲光榮之至。餘先述大勝利之如何獲得以及戰鬥之經過，並講述其數大要點如下：一敵之作戰目的，乃野望將亞細亞作爲彼等之殖民地，此實爲第一次世界大戰以來，猶太財閥之最大野望也。大東亞戰爆發以來，已約有三年，而敵方依然未放棄此種野望，並強制彼國國民犧牲生命，消耗財物，而企圖達成此種野望。敵方戰略</p>
<p>二敵方企圖達成第一目的之戰略如下：敵方在太平洋進攻，乃計劃奪回菲律賓，並在中國侵入陸海軍，以給日本經濟之封鎖，乃進而利用菲島及中國爲基地，並徵用其人力物力，以降服日本。並以此項任務，命敵太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米茲及麥克沃塞大將史蒂維爾大將。尼米茲乃以麥克沃塞之軍力進攻新幾內亞及菲律賓，並企圖佔領台灣，侵入中國東南沿海地帶，乃與麥沃塞軍隊共入中國大陸，而利用中國爲戰塲，與日本作大決戰。史蒂維爾大將在尼米茲之作戰中，自中國大陸援助，先以空軍侵入中國大陸，而建築中國殖民地化之基璴，爲進行以上之目的起見，實有組織有偉大攻擊力之特殊部隊之必要。故此處集中美海軍之最優秀部隊，編成第五十八機動部隊，敵美以此機動部隊，託以最大之自信，自本年十一月起總反攻開始時，即行參加奪取吉爾貝特韋島者，即此部隊也。進攻新幾內亞者，亦此部隊也。而最近佔領塞班島，迭尼安島，及天宮島者，亦此部隊也。一年之後之今日，此第五十八機動部隊，遂參加進攻台灣琉球及菲島，此部隊備有巨大之大砲，一千架飛機，及準備金富之燃料彈藥而能保持遠距離攻擊之需要，故名之曰艦隊列車，實爲世界上最強之艦隊也。激戰經過</p>
<p>此艦隊乃敢於大東亞戰以來，對台灣作大攻擊，井以麥克沃塞進攻菲島，而史蒂維爾則在渝方美空軍基地待機，而羅斯福即以此大規模作戰，企圖解決大東亞戰爭。此大規模作戰開始於十月十日夜，我方航空部隊於十月十一日早晨即發見之，乃開始反攻擊，十二日敵方以飛機一千一百架空襲台灣，我方地上砲火開始高射，而擊落其飛機一百十架，而我方航空部隊即於夜間以全部攻擊力集中攻擊其艦隊，而擊沉其航空母艦，而此敵方自稱世界最強之艦隊，於十三日之數小時內，經三千架飛機之參加攻擊，我方給與敵艦隊致命之打擊。至十四日敵方乃求駐渝美空軍之援助，而有駐美渝空軍Ｂ２９型機一百架參加對吾方之空襲，而經十二日及十三日二日之我方空襲，敵所誇豪於世界之第五十八機動部隊已告潰滅，而司令官米茲基愛爾中將所乘之超大型航空母艦亦告擊沉，而敵方之第三艦隊及第五十八機動部隊於受滿身創瘐後，捨已擊沉之兵體而向東方敗走。我方航空部隊及我方聯合艦隊之一部，乃將敵方存體隊繼續攻擊，使彼完全潰滅，而敵方一千架飛機及二萬八千將士已在太平洋上毀滅，此實對一年來敵方所謂［倘日本海軍有戰意請來與美海軍決戰］之挑戰詞，而至今我海軍已與其回答矣。　　此次慘敗使羅斯福總統喪失選舉之最大宣傳材料，遂有命令斯勃爾恩斯率領之第五艦隊及麥克沃塞軍隊拼死攻擊之命令，希望即使有一兵一卒能在菲島上陸，亦可向彼國內宣傳。蓋當初原定以五十八機動部隊消滅日本海軍一舉而在非島登陸，不意五十八機動部隊竟遭全滅，且使將兵士氣焰於混亂局面中。然美國尚欲虘張趨勢，示其軍力之偉大，勃爾恩斯之第三艦隊與麥克沃塞遂迅速編成艦艇在菲島上陸，此實無何等恐慌在。蓋我航空部隊早已發現該機動部隊，而擊沉擊沒其大部份，雖得在雷伊泰灣上陸，必將爲我各方面集結之部隊所寂滅。宣傳要求英國艦隊及在華美空軍出動，此不過證明美國艦隊已陷於全滅狀態耳。努力增產</p>
<p>我國在此一年中，再貯蓄航空兵力於各地，粉碎敵方出動，使大東亞戰爭之戰局全部一變，而獲得我艦隊在太平洋戰爭勝利之鍵，此次海戰我方除喪失飛機三百二十架外，並無其他損害。此次海空戰實爲第二次之日本海海戰，本人因此次以飛機出擊而獲此偉大戰果，特於各位申述如上。此種大戰果，全因增強生產與我科學優秀所致，故今後之大戰果，亦因生產急速度之上昇而加大，則戰勝之光輝，將蒞臨我亞細亞民族頭上。雖然古語云：［爲山九伋功　一簣]。此語大足警戒，故我人非與各位昂揚戰意怒力完成寂滅英美之目標不可。同時本人與各位開此大戰果，欣慰之餘，已準備次第申述明日獲得之大戰果云云。</p>

<p>由北京到天津</p>
<p>記者坐著早上八時十分由北京開出的京津特快車來津。在北京乘火車，那便和上海完全不同：不僅車票隨到可以隨買，買了票也可以隨便上車。譬如我這次坐的一班車原是要到八時十分開車。可是七點鐘就開始軋票了，所以在上海所看到的種種擁擠和排隊情形可說完全沒有，眞使我想不到爲什麽在一個國內竟有如此不同的局面！覓旅館難如登天</p>
<p>這個年頭出門第一苦事莫如正式旅客的覓取旅館，爲了這個問題會使我在北京受著很多的苦痛。因此，我這一回到天津來就不得不在事先作妥善的佈置。在我離開北京之前一天，就請情報局管局長替我打一電話到天津華北新報去定一個房間，滿以爲萬無一失了。不料我雖然在午前十一時趕到須磨街華北新報，經過了他們善意的設法，還是僅能由他們同事之一在大闊飯店所開的一個小房間讓給我住，我因爲不慣於住他人的屋自，於是在下午便去看我自上海北來時的一位同伴，才靠著他和他的友人們設法，終於找到了一處華區的軍管理旅社——新天津飯店。這批朋友們，都是從上海到天津來經商的，竟然能爲我解決了一這件萬難的事，我實在太感謝他們了。到第二天我再去拜訪華北新報的時候，當他們聽到了我昨天找尋旅社的事故，連這班老天津都自歎不如！他鄉逢到了故知</p>
<p>天津在大體上和上海相同，不過近年來以受舞場停閉的影響，夜市已十分蕭條，電燈也不像北京一般可以隨意開著。我在天津新認識的這批摩登商人，手面着實闊綽得很，雖然和他們是初交，却因爲他鄉逢故客的關係，却十分感到熱情。我們先在［第第］吃夜飯，啤酒簡直使我的肚子幾乎裝滿，又到俄國總會廳音樂。在寂寞的旅居，竟逢到這樣熱情的友人招待，使我愈感到他們的偉大！在北國的上海藝人</p>
<p>上海人在天津的很多，當我第二天早上在新天津飯店的食堂用早膳的時候，在座頭上忽然發現顧蘭君和李英夫婦，後來在報上才知道他們乃是來津演劇的。近來上海電影明星組織劇團到華被來演話劇的很多，在北京有　化與賀寶等人所組的一個劇團。於此可知北國的人們，乃是如何地崇拜著上海的藝人。就是在北京出版的映書旬刊，其內容也大都取材於上海的藝人消息。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Currency, Prices, and Control Issues <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Taro Yuki, advisor to the Japanese Cabinet, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Bank of Japan, has come to China specifically to investigate the Chinese economy. Our newspaper published an open letter to Advisor Yuki on the 21st. Now, we would like to offer some specific opinions on economic issues to Advisor Yuki, which may serve as a reference for his investigation of the Chinese economy. Advisor Yuki is a leading figure in the Japanese financial and economic circles, with decades of service in the Japanese financial sector, holding an important position. Although he has resigned as the Governor of the Bank of Japan, he participates in the planning of decisive financial and economic strategies in his capacity as an advisor to the Cabinet and the Greater East Asia Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. We naturally extend a warm welcome to such an important figure coming to China for investigation. Moreover, at a time when we are facing significant difficulties in our economy, finance, and financial affairs, our expectations for Advisor Yuki are very high. From Advisor Yuki's several remarks, although brief, we can see his sincere concern for the Chinese economy. Therefore, we would like to briefly present the following three points to Advisor Yuki: Firstly, because Advisor Yuki has special experience in handling the most important currency issues in financial matters. Advisor Yuki's management has greatly contributed to maintaining the relative stability of the Japanese currency. The issue of the Chinese currency, which has an expansionary trend and is not easy to contract, is a part of the problem of winning the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we hope that Advisor Yuki can plan an appropriate countermeasure. Whether the Chinese currency is inflated has been a subject of discussion among various parties, but due to the special needs during the war, there is a sense of expansion. At the same time, due to the instability of the political situation, the psychology of valuing goods over money has become a widespread phenomenon. As a result, prices are rising, affecting the normal progress of national finance, people's lives, and all economic matters. The impact is not insignificant. If it is allowed to continue, the danger is significant. Therefore, we ask Advisor Yuki to assist in stabilizing the Chinese currency. On the 7th, when Advisor Yuki answered questions from reporters in Shanghai, he said: "The so-called currency inflation is due to the need for currency." However, we feel that abnormal needs must be tightened and restricted. Otherwise, if prices rise, the need for chips is great, and currency is issued indefinitely to meet this need, leading to further price increases, and if this cycle continues, there will eventually be an unimaginable day. Secondly, the issue of prices has now become the core of various economic problems, and even a part of political problems. Advisor Yuki said in a speech on the 17th: "The first problem in Shanghai now is the price issue." Advisor Yuki believes that "a certain degree of price increase during wartime is inevitable. If speculation and hoarding, and other behaviors that disrupt the economy can be suppressed, the increase may not cause the people to feel great pain." We do not want to ignore the harm of speculation and hoarding. However, speculation and hoarding are parasitic. If there are not too few goods and too much currency, and if the political institutions are not sound enough, we believe that speculation and hoarding cannot stand. Therefore, while cracking down on speculation and hoarding, we must fundamentally find ways to increase production to enrich goods, contract currency to relatively suppress prices, and improve political institutions to facilitate the implementation of economic facilities. There are many areas where Japan needs to assist in these matters. Among them, increasing production is particularly important, and ensuring resources, cultivating labor, facilitating transportation, and improving public security are the basic conditions for increasing or maintaining production. Thirdly, regarding the issue of economic control, it goes without saying that control is necessary during wartime. However, the implementation of control must be reasonable and appropriate. This is an old saying, but there are many areas in China's current economic control that need to be improved. Not only do the actual environments between countries differ, but sometimes the actual environments between regions also vary. If what is done in A is forcibly applied to B, it may be difficult to avoid the bad result of failing to imitate a tiger. Advisor Yuki also said in a speech on the 17th: "Control has its limits and cannot be implemented in any situation. It must be determined according to national conditions and the times." Therefore, control measures that are not suitable for national conditions, the times, and the environment, and that excessively affect people's lives, must be thoroughly improved. Also, the current Chinese economic control, like politics, tends to be divided, which is a major shortcoming. Multi-headed control often results in mutual restraint and even mutual strife, which greatly affects the implementation of sound control policies. Therefore, we ask Advisor Yuki to make special efforts to help make control measures reasonable and appropriate, and to simplify the control mechanism. We have discussed the most important issues in China's current economy, currency issues, price issues, and control issues as above. We hope that after Advisor Yuki returns to his country, he will convey the aforementioned points to the relevant Japanese authorities and people from all walks of life and pay attention to them. ○Tokyo 22nd Central News Agency report: The Japanese Military Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on October 21st: On the 19th and 20th, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy convoys and landing troops attempting to invade Leyte Gulf, achieving the following results: sinking one large enemy transport ship and one destroyer, and damaging one enemy transport ship, two aircraft carriers, and two battleships. ○Tokyo 22nd Central News Agency report: According to a report from the Southwest Pacific base, twenty enemy B-24 aircraft came to Davao City, Mindanao, during the day. They were intercepted by the Japanese army in the area, and a total of six aircraft were shot down. ○Lisbon, 22nd Central News Agency report: According to the Associated Press: Four American landing craft and several small boats used for the Leyte Island landing have been sunk by Japanese coastal artillery and mortar fire. It is also reported that the landing force under Krueger encountered strong resistance from the Japanese army, and the Japanese army's resistance has become stronger. British ships in the Indian Ocean suffered three air raids in Yangon. ○Lisbon 22nd Central News Agency report: According to a report, the Southeast Asia Military Command announced on the 22nd that the East Asia Fleet (including a dozen battleships and aircraft carriers) had launched operations in Nicobar City this week, attacking the islands. ○Japanese military base on the Myanmar front, 22nd Central News Agency report: On the 20th, 68 enemy P47, P51, and P38 fighter planes attacked the Yangon area for the third time. The Japanese fighter squadron and ground forces intercepted them, launching a fierce air battle, shooting down four P38 aircraft (two of which were unconfirmed) and destroying four P51 and P47 aircraft, and inflicting considerable damage on many other aircraft, driving them back. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft self-destructed, and the ground suffered very little damage.</p>

<p>○Central News Agency, Beijing: After the news of the enemy American forces landing on Leyte Island in the Philippines was released, all circles here expressed deep concern. They paid particular attention to the future development of the war situation in that area. Since the enemy's operation to recapture the Philippines has begun here, it is expected that they will make a desperate effort to fight. It is believed that the Japanese army in the Philippines has already made strong defenses and will be able to strike the enemy and inflict heavy damage. However, looking at the overall war situation in the Pacific, its significance and situation cannot be denied. Therefore, as far as China is concerned, at this critical moment in the war situation, all Chinese people should strengthen their efforts and enhance the system of cooperation in the war. The independence and freedom of China must be premised on the completion of the liberation of East Asia. If East Asia is still controlled by Britain and the United States, then not only will East Asia never be liberated, but even the restoration and prosperity of a country will be completely hopeless. Therefore, we can truly say that we have reached a critical juncture of survival and destruction. In order to seek the survival and independence of China, and to seek the freedom and liberation of East Asia, we must immediately devote all our national strength to closely cooperate with the countries and nationalities of East Asia, and with the determination to win, rise up and destroy Britain and the United States. Today, the battle of Leyte Island is by no means just a matter for Japan and the Philippines. It is a life-and-death battle for the one billion people of East Asia. Therefore, in addition to inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and crushing their counter-attack attempts, there is no other time to danger. All those who truly love our Chinese motherland will be able to strengthen their efforts with the righteousness of shared hatred and unwavering determination, and contribute all their strength to the country and the nation, to destroy the enemy and ensure the permanent independence and freedom of our country, thereby contributing to the prosperity of East Asia. The future of China will be determined here. We, the Chinese people, should make redoubled efforts to maintain the glory of 5,000 years of history, so that we can be permanently in the world. Ambassador Aizawa expressed his thoughts ○Saigon, 22nd Central News Agency report: After Foreign Vice Minister Matsudaira succeeded him as the Japanese ambassador to Vietnam, former Ambassador Aizawa hosted reporters at his official residence on the evening of the 21st, recalling his three years in Vietnam. He said that the embassy in Hanoi has been established for three years. When he took office, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the area became an important base for operations and a supply base, occupying an important position militarily. Although he is not very talented, he believes that he has not made any major mistakes. The embassy's affairs are on track, and he can leave with peace of mind. He has had various discussions with Governor-General Decoux in Hanoi and Saigon, and everything is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>○Japanese Front Line, 22nd Central News Agency report: The Guilin Airfield has been automatically destroyed by the Chongqing army due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army's ground forces. The ground is full of holes, like a wilderness, showing the end of being subdued by the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. According to the current situation seen by Japanese aircraft when they were conducting reconnaissance of the Guilin air defense fortress, the auxiliary taxiway of the Guilin No. 1 Airfield (13 kilometers southwest of Guilin City) is about 150 meters long and the width of the taxiway is about 100 meters, but at present, there are huge holes every 100 meters, which were probably blown up. From the observation in the fortress, there are no less than seven large holes. Also, the taxiway guide road or connecting road has huge holes every 100 meters to 200 meters. Also, the important taxiway that runs parallel to the sun (length) seems to have not been destroyed yet. The US Air Force seems to be using it as a mobile airfield for fighters, and this place may also be destroyed soon. The buildings on both sides of the main taxiway have been almost completely destroyed. The second airfield has been completely destroyed. There are now four large holes in the main taxiway (approximately 2,000 meters long and 200 meters wide), which are quite deep and the situation is extremely desolate. There are also holes at the end of the connecting road and taxiway. The main taxiway of Guilin's third airfield (on both sides of the second airfield) (approximately 20 meters long and 9 meters wide) also has 25 or 6 large holes.

<p>○Berlin, 22nd Central News Agency report: Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army in the Balkans continued to break through from the east to the west to connect with Tito's guerrillas, and cut off the German army in the southern Balkans. The Belgrade area, the center of the war, is still in fierce fighting. The Soviet army seems to attach great importance to the Balkan front, and many troops are concentrated there. The Soviet army has increased pressure on the lower reaches of the Morava River, especially between Nis and the Belgrade area. The Bulgarian army is advancing southwest from the Nis area, and the fighting is taking place in the Plovdiv and Kraljevo-Kragujevac areas. There are only minor changes in the Hungarian border war. The Soviet army is advancing to the Danube River west of the Tisza River, and the German army is突进southeast of Szolnok.

<h3 id="e4">The Negro Problem in the United States <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Increase of Negroes</p>
<p>The states with the highest concentrations of Negroes are South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, which face the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. These eight states are all relatively warm lands. These eight states have</p>
<p>1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1930 The increase in the Negro population is the biggest threat to Americans. However, about 7/15 of the Negroes currently living in the United States can be said to be mixed with white people. In addition, Dr. Dubs took the Negroes in Georgia, the oldest Negro colony in the United States, as the center, added investigation data from other states and reviewed them. According to the report, at least about one-third of the entire Negro population is mixed with whites. More than half of the Negroes in the United States, about 6 million people. In the two states of South Carolina and Mississippi, the Negro population actually exceeds the white population. The Negro and white populations in Louisiana are half each, and their productivity is very high. The rapid increase in the US population is actually due to Negroes. The increase in the Negro population in the past 100 years is as follows: 1,771,656 2,873,648 4,441,830 6,580,793 8,833,994 10,463,131 11,891,143 blood. In short, due to climate, soil, food, and the result of miscegenation, the skin color of Negroes has gradually changed. This is a fact. When I was in the United States, I inspected the accommodation status of Japanese patients at the famous insane asylum in Nai Po, California. At that time, due to the explanation of Dr. Bratley, I saw a Negro madman. That Negro was different from the Negroes commonly seen on Negro streets. Although he had the same black face, he was very bright, with a shiny black color, a large and shiny nose, a wide and broad nasal cavity, curly hair, red lips, and large and white teeth. His name was Pebe, and he was a pure African. According to the doctor, he was of the same species as the Negroes who were previously enslaved and brought to the southern regions. Now there are very few such Negroes. Pebe was the driver for William Taylor, the famous movie director in Hollywood. Taylor killed someone, and the truth of the incident is unknown. Pebe knew the most at the time, so he went crazy. We talked to him, and he seemed to still have lingering fears, and his voice trembled when he answered.</p>
<p>Negro Occupations</p>
<p>Negroes are mostly deep in love, obedient and resigned to fate. Unless aroused by wine and lust, they do not do very cruel things, and they are not stubborn. Although they are not very intelligent, they are quite clever. And some are like primitive people, children, lacking self-control. They are easily moved and like music. Most of the Negroes in the South are engaged in cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar.</p>
<p>Engaged in agriculture 1,987,839</p>
<p>Engaged in forestry and fisheries 31,732</p>
<p>Mine workers 74,973</p>
<p>Industrial workers 1,024,656</p>
<p>Workers 397,645</p>
<p>Technicians 183,803</p>
<p>Transportation inspectors 50,203</p>
<p>Engaged in commerce 1,576,205</p>
<p>Public Utilities Workers 40,549</p>
<p>Freelancers</p>
<p>Religious people</p>
<p>Total 5,503,535</p>
<p>The distribution of the Negro population is as follows:</p>
<p>New York 227,706</p>
<p>Chicago 233,903</p>
<p>Philadelphia 229,599</p>
<p>Detroit 120,066</p>
<p>Cleveland 71,899</p>
<p>St. Louis 93,580</p>
<p>Gyzepike 54,983</p>
<p>New Sistiti 43,967</p>
<p>Indianapolis 38,574</p>
<p>Discrimination in Treatment</p>
<p>In the states of the South, various state laws have been established that discriminate against Negroes. For example, the laws commonly known as Jim Crow laws were created to distinguish Negroes from white people on trains. New statistics are not available. According to older statistics, the occupational divisions of Negroes are as follows:</p>
<p>Also, the ten major industrial centers of the</p>
<p>Negro passengers, no matter how crowded, cannot ride on the white people's train, even if the white people's train is empty. Also, on streetcars, Negro seats and white people's seats are separated. Barbershops and taverns are also clearly distinguished, and Negroes are not allowed to stay in hotels. Marriage between white people and Negroes is, of course, strictly prohibited. Regarding this unequal law, according to what Americans say: White people want to marry Negroes, and Negroes want to marry white people, but both are not allowed, which is considered fair. However, in reality, there may be Negroes who want to marry white people, but there are absolutely no white people who want to marry Negroes, except for idiots and madmen. As a result, this is, of course, discrimination against Negroes. Originally, regardless of whether they are Negroes or white people, they are now citizens of the United States and are granted equal voting rights and the right to be elected. Therefore, prohibiting marriage between citizens is a reaction law. However, white people use various means to legalize this illegal act. As the Negroes' struggle against white people quoted at the beginning of this article, there have been many such incidents in the past. In 1917, the race war that occurred in St. Louis killed 39 Negroes and 8 white people. Also, in 1919, there were 26 incidents of conflict between Negroes and white people. The most intense of these were the race wars that occurred in Washington and Chicago in the United States. The reason for this was that the Negro troops who had returned from participating in the First European War were still being discriminated against by white people, so they expressed their indignation and suddenly launched an opposition movement.

<h3 id="e5">The Second Day of the Rally to Celebrate the Annihilation of the American and British Fleets <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Speeches by President Chiang and Lieutenant Ota</p>
<p>The [Rally to Celebrate the Annihilation of the American and British Fleets], organized by the Shanghai Press Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Citizens' Welfare Association, continued for its second day. The planned chairpersons were Mr. Funatsu Ichiro, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin, Su Jinxiong, Bai Huangjing, Lu Feng, and the Director-General of the Japan News Agency, Mr. Im Yun-peng. First, Huang Jingzhai, the rotating chairman of the Press Association, delivered the opening remarks. Then, President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy and Lieutenant Ota of the Allied Nations' Fleet Reporting Department in China gave speeches, their words full of warning, moving the audience. Finally, naval battle newsreels and the new Huaying film [Reunion] were shown. The event ended at 7:30 PM. Today is the last day, still held at the Grand Theater, with speeches by Mr. Idechi, the Army Reporting Director, and Mr. Huang Jingzhai, the rotating chairman of the Press Association. There will also be a performance by the Shanghai Jiaotong Orchestra and a concert by famous Chinese and Japanese singers. President Jiang's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly, our enemy – America – is trying to use its naval power to fulfill its ambitions of aggression, and is arrogantly trying to approach the Japanese mainland. The Allied Japanese Navy will surely have the determination to annihilate the enemy and shatter its offensive intentions. The Japanese Navy will surely win for the following reasons: First, the Japanese Navy possesses the strategy and tactics to suppress the enemy. Second, the commanders of the Japanese Navy have steadfast and unyielding spirits. Third, the Japanese Navy is fully prepared for inland operations, and its combat power is very strong and solid. It is impossible for the enemy America to break through this solid barrier. Fourth, the main fleet of the Japanese Navy is intact and undamaged, and it is now watching for the enemy's weaknesses in order to annihilate it in one blow. Fifth, in response to the invincible spirit of the Japanese Navy, it will surely stimulate the full development of the production power of 100 million people in the rear. The American Pacific Fleet that launched this attack, the elite of the American mobile task force that America boasts about, was mostly annihilated by the Allied Navy on October 12th. It can be said to be the greatest victory since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and we cannot help but have some feelings about this victory. In particular, the fact that we should pay more attention to now is that with the Japanese Navy's victory this time, it has created an opportunity for a so-called greater and more extreme transformation of the war situation. This point is really worth celebrating together. (Omission) However, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely not be achieved by eating well and doing nothing. The struggle of the soldiers at the front depends on the inspiration of the rear. How should we strengthen the close cooperation between the front and the rear? We must use unwavering courage and supreme passion to exchange for this final victory. We must aim at the ideal of the liberation of Greater East Asia and, from now on, vow to advance fiercely in response to the victories of the Allied Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Lieutenant Ota's Speech <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lieutenant Ota gave an impromptu speech on [How to Achieve Great Victories]. The original speech is as follows: I take this opportunity to briefly discuss the great victory east of Taiwan, which is a great honor. I will first describe how the great victory was achieved and the course of the battle, and then describe several major points as follows: First, the enemy's operational purpose is to have the ambition to make Asia their colony. This is the greatest ambition of the Jewish financial groups since the First World War. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been about three years, and the enemy has not yet given up this ambition, and has forced its people to sacrifice their lives and consume their wealth in an attempt to achieve this ambition. Enemy Strategy</p>
<p>Second, the enemy's strategy to achieve the first goal is as follows: The enemy's offensive in the Pacific is planned to recapture the Philippines, and to invade China with the army and navy, in order to blockade the Japanese economy, and then to use the Philippines and China as bases, and to requisition their manpower and resources, in order to subdue Japan. And this task was ordered to Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the American Pacific Fleet, and Generals MacArthur and Stilwell. Nimitz planned to use MacArthur's forces to attack New Guinea and the Philippines, and to occupy Taiwan, invading the southeastern coastal area of China, and then to enter the Chinese mainland together with MacArthur's troops, and to use China as a battlefield for a major decisive battle with Japan. General Stilwell, in Nimitz's operations, provided assistance from the Chinese mainland, first invading the Chinese mainland by air force, and building the foundation for the colonization of China. In order to carry out the above purposes, it was necessary to have a special unit with organized and great attacking power. Therefore, the most outstanding units of the American Navy were concentrated here to form the 58th Mobile Task Force. With this mobile unit, the enemy America entrusted the greatest confidence, and it participated in the capture of Gilbert Island starting from the general counter-offensive in November of this year. The unit that attacked New Guinea was also this unit. And recently, the unit that occupied Saipan, Tinian, and Tianning Island was also this unit. Today, one year later, this 58th Mobile Task Force participated in the attack on Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. This unit is equipped with huge cannons, 1,000 aircraft, and sufficient fuel and ammunition to maintain long-range attacks, so it is called the Fleet Train, which is the strongest fleet in the world. Course of Fierce Battle</p>
<p>This fleet dared to launch a major attack on Taiwan since the Greater East Asia War, while MacArthur attacked the Philippines, and Stilwell waited in the American Air Force base in Chongqing. Roosevelt attempted to resolve the Greater East Asia War with this large-scale operation. This large-scale operation began on the night of October 10th. Our aviation unit discovered it on the morning of October 11th, and began to counterattack. On October 12th, the enemy attacked Taiwan with 1,100 aircraft. Our ground artillery began anti-aircraft fire and shot down 110 of its aircraft. Our aviation unit then concentrated its full attack power on the fleet at night, sinking its aircraft carriers. This fleet, which the enemy claimed to be the strongest in the world, suffered a fatal blow from our side during the attack by 3,000 aircraft on the 13th within a few hours. By the 14th, the enemy sought assistance from the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and 100 B29 aircraft from the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing participated in the air raid on our side. After our air raids on the 12th and 13th, the 58th Mobile Task Force, which the enemy boasted about in the world, had been annihilated, and the super-large aircraft carrier on which Commander Mitscher was riding was also sunk. The enemy's Third Fleet and 58th Mobile Task Force, after suffering injuries all over, abandoned the sunken warships and fled eastward. Our aviation unit and a part of our combined fleet continued to attack the enemy's surviving units, completely annihilating them. The enemy's 1,000 aircraft and 28,000 soldiers have been destroyed in the Pacific Ocean. This is indeed an answer to the enemy's challenge over the past year: [If the Japanese Navy has the will to fight, please come and have a decisive battle with the American Navy]. Our navy has now given its answer. This disastrous defeat caused President Roosevelt to lose the biggest propaganda material for the election, so he ordered the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance and MacArthur's troops to attack desperately, hoping that even if one soldier could land on the Philippines, it could be propagandized to his country. Originally, it was planned to eliminate the Japanese Navy with the 58th Mobile Task Force in one fell swoop and land on the Philippines, but unexpectedly, the 58th Mobile Task Force was completely annihilated, and the morale of the soldiers was in a chaotic situation. However, the United States still wants to show its strength and demonstrate the greatness of its military power. Spruance's Third Fleet and MacArthur quickly formed warships and landed in the Philippines, but there is nothing to panic about. Our aviation unit had already discovered the mobile unit and sunk and destroyed most of it. Even if they landed in Leyte Gulf, they would be annihilated by the units gathered from all sides by us. The propaganda demanded that the British fleet and the American Air Force in China be dispatched, which only proves that the American fleet has been completely destroyed. Efforts to Increase Production</p>
<p>During this year, our country has re-stored aviation forces in various places, crushing the enemy's dispatch, causing the entire war situation in the Greater East Asia War to change completely, and obtaining the key to our fleet's victory in the Pacific War. In this naval battle, we suffered no other damage except for the loss of 320 aircraft. This naval and air battle was the second Battle of the Sea of Japan. Because I participated in this attack with aircraft and achieved this great victory, I am specially reporting to you as above. This kind of great victory is entirely due to the strengthening of production and the excellence of our science. Therefore, the great victory in the future will also be increased due to the rapid increase in production, and the glory of victory will come to the heads of our Asian people. Although the ancient saying goes: [Building a mountain requires nine trips, but failing at the last basket]. This saying is very cautionary, so we must not fail to arouse our fighting spirit and strive to complete the goal of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. At the same time, while I am happy to share this great victory with you, I am prepared to gradually report the great victories to be achieved tomorrow, and so on.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (the 24th) is the first anniversary of the declaration of war against Britain and the United States by the Provisional Government of Free India. The Indian Volunteer Army of this city will hold a parade at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM that afternoon.

<h3 id="e9">Weekly Market Conditions <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Market conditions in Shanghai's financial and industrial sectors hovered uncertainly last week.</p>
<p>Hedgehogs were searching in many ways, trending upward step by step. Silver dollar and silver ingots rose significantly, and the silver supply remained tight. However, stocks rose and then fell again. The chaotic financial situation was due to the promulgation of the "Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in the Shanghai Special City" by the Ministry of Finance on Friday. Small banks were severely hit, leaving them with no room to operate. Without unscrupulous disturbances, the financial situation stabilized. On Saturday morning, most speculative commodities fell. The production rate of various factories showed no signs of improvement, but because inventories could still meet market needs, no changes were seen amidst calls for supply-demand balance. Although rice and miscellaneous grains did not see a sharp rise last week, there was no hope of a fall. People are quietly waiting for the government's measures to suppress prices to take effect.</p>

<p>The Shanghai League Football Tournament at Zhaozhou Park had three Jia group matches. At 10:00 AM, the Jewish team played the Russian Sports Association. The Jewish team was ultimately better, defeating the Russian Sports Association three to one. At 2:00 PM, the Wen Du team played the German Merchants. In the first half, the Wen Du team scored two goals. During the second half, the battle was still fierce, and the German Merchants ultimately lost one to two. At 4:00 PM, Donghua played Three Provinces. Both sides played brilliantly. Although Three Provinces lost by a score of one to three, Donghua was very alarmed. Huang Zhendong of Three Provinces provided comprehensive defense and made great contributions. Goalkeeper Huang Zhendong repeatedly saved difficult shots, showing McNeitty's style. In addition, in the Jia group football league, Huatong played Jilin at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Unfortunately, Huatong narrowly lost to Jilin by a score of one to two. Both sides in this match lacked finesse, and there was no strategy to speak of. The goals scored were very forced.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Tianjin Travelogue <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>From Beijing to Tianjin</p>
<p>The reporter took the Beijing-Tianjin express train, which departed from Beijing at 8:10 AM, to Tianjin. Taking the train in Beijing is completely different from Shanghai. Not only can you buy tickets as soon as you arrive, but you can also get on the train as you please after buying the ticket. For example, the train I took this time was originally scheduled to depart at 8:10 AM, but ticket checks began at 7:00 AM. Therefore, all kinds of crowding and queuing that I saw in Shanghai were completely absent. It really made me wonder why there are such different situations in the same country! Finding a Hotel is as Difficult as Ascending to Heaven</p>
<p>In this day and age, the first hardship of traveling is finding a hotel for regular travelers. This problem caused me a lot of suffering in Beijing. Therefore, I had to make proper arrangements in advance before returning to Tianjin this time. The day before I left Beijing, I asked Director Guan of the Information Bureau to call the Tianjin Huabei Xinbao to book a room for me. I thought it was foolproof. Unexpectedly, although I rushed to the Huabei Xinbao on Suma Street at 11:00 AM, after their kind efforts, they were only able to let me stay in a small room in the Dakuo Hotel, which was opened by one of their colleagues. Because I was not used to living in someone else's house, I went to see a companion who had come north from Shanghai that afternoon. With his help and the help of his friends, I finally found a military-managed hotel in the Chinese district - the New Tianjin Hotel. These friends, who all came to Tianjin from Shanghai to do business, were able to solve this difficult problem for me, and I am really grateful to them. The next day, when I went to visit the Huabei Xinbao, when they heard about my accident in finding a hotel yesterday, even these old Tianjin residents sighed in admiration! Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land</p>
<p>Tianjin is generally the same as Shanghai, but in recent years, due to the impact of the closure of dance halls, the night market has been very depressed, and the lights are not as easily turned on as in Beijing. These modern merchants I newly met in Tianjin are very generous. Although I just met them, I felt very warmly welcomed because of the old friend. We first ate dinner at [Didi], and the beer almost filled my stomach. Then we went to the Russian General Assembly Hall for music. In the lonely journey, I encountered such warm hospitality from friends, which made me feel their greatness even more! Shanghai Artists in the Northern Country</p>
<p>There are many Shanghainese in Tianjin. When I was having breakfast in the cafeteria of the New Tianjin Hotel the next morning, I suddenly saw Gu Lanjun and Li Ying and his wife at the head of the table. Later, I learned from the newspaper that they were here to perform plays. Recently, many Shanghai movie stars have organized troupes to come to North China to perform dramas. There is a troupe in Beijing organized by Wei Wenhua and He Bao and others. From this, it can be seen how much the people in the northern country admire the artists of Shanghai. Even the content of the Ying Shu Xun Kan, which is published in Beijing, is mostly based on news about Shanghai artists.</p>
