<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>胸中的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>拙著日文版言論集，由於申報社與中日文化研究所的協助，而出了版了。對於該書，某日本報紙認爲是「代表中國人言未敢言，說未敢說的與論」的，但同時又附加一句說：「按理中國人內心的呼聲，中國人本身知道得更清楚。爲了更加改善東亞，中國及和平區的情形，最重要者，是他們自發的吶喊。本國民的呼聲，首先讓本國民去吶喊吧！我們的呼聲就是這一點」。在原則上，當然我也完全同意這個意見。假如日本人能吶喊出日本人的內心呼聲，中國人能吶喊出中國人的呼聲，自然就用不著越俎代皰。姑且不談日本問題，然而現在中國人，是否究竟能够吶喊出中國人內心的呼聲呢？這誠屬疑問。例如貪官污吏，無論怎樣橫打跋扈，假定稍加指責，則就被視爲違犯「勝利第一」的「邪說異端」，而論者即被誣爲「敵人第五縱隊」。同流合污，和隨波逐流，就是在這樣米珠薪桂的今天，保持飯盌的最好適者。現在在申報這樣的大報，甚至有人說是「邪說異端」的製造所。在這樣一個時代裏，那末向一般中國老百姓要求，須吶喊中國人內心的呼聲，這簡直等於讓套著貞操帶的女人生兒育女一樣的不合道理。當然誰也不能否認，最周密地瞭解中國人內心者，就是中國人本身。像我這樣異國人，無論怎樣孜孜不息，努力用功，也不能如實地洞察中國人的苦悶。然而中國人間，尙有不能不借重像我這樣異國人的筆，來發表己見的地方，這就是不可抑止的苦悶使然。我對於這個問題不願再事浪費筆墨。如把最近我所收到的一對讀者信介紹出來，就會知道我所　曉辯解者，絕非子虛。如原文如下：</p>
<p>先生是日本人，我是中國人，我和先生素不相識，現在冒昧地寫上這封信，我想您乍見一定很驚異，但您讀完了我這封信，至少可以更明暸一些中國和平區人民的苦痛心理，以後先生再有高論，也可以多一些材料作爲依據。同時，我能將胸中的苦悶——也是一部份中國人的苦悶——說給一位能代中國人說幾句話的日本朋友聽了，我自己也似覺鬆一口氣。</p>
<p>現在在上海日本高喊「大東亞共榮圈云云」，在中國要討日本人歡喜的，因而給日本人聽到也是一片的「大東亞共榮圈云云」可是中國民間的裏層呢？</p>
<p>離開上海若干里以外的鄉下。鄉下人說：「我們現在眞是共和國了。你瞧！「共」「和」「國」，可不是嗎？」這三個字裏的「國」字，是否國體的「國」，還是別有所指姑且不談。我們先來看「共」「和」。</p>
<p>共產主義的新四軍，現在如油入麵，如蝨入毛。他們除自稱「核心」的部份以外，還有當地組織的「民兵」，作爲「觸　」。農民們當民兵有什麼好處？一半因爲被迫不能不當，一半，當了民兵可以胡作胡爲。例如一個民兵的大隊長就可作主將人「正法」，假如攻下一個市鎭，民兵便可以隨意拆毀房屋揀好的拿。當然，民兵如是佃農，那個倒霉的田主，早給一折八扣別想收田租了。（轉入第四版）</p>

<h3>日陸軍紀念節　三品部長演詞</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　（續昨）又其後　時之山本海相，就明治三十七年二月四日御前會議之情形申，述如下：其時之御前會議，爲森嚴且激烈之會議，但各列席人員之激論，漸次鎭靜，當時內閣總理大臣伊藤公，對天皇陛下曾上奏稱，目前陛下所知不能確信如是，但事實所至，仰祈陛下御裁，以博文所知，非開戰不可，不能坐視俄國蹂躪，蓋呈斷一下，萬事解決。因此日政府　無對俄戰勝萬　之確信，仍企圖一戰者，蓋對俄國之暴戾，實不能容忍也。緣基於大義所在，同時亦依據澎湃之國民總意之結集與昂揚。前此日淸戰爭後，因三國干涉受有交還遼東屈辱之國民，上爲奉聖上之意，下爲對父兄戰友之英靈，不知所恐，不知怨憤，上下齊一，衷心實深愉快。</p>
<p>吾人再回憶俄國於戰後，陸軍總帥庫洛巴那勒所誌之回想錄中，有云：「我全俄國民不能理解戰爭目的，因而對戰爭抱不滿態度，以致前方將士不克得到後方國民之援助。軍隊之中雖有若干義勇兵，此輩皆屬一般平民而已。而貴族商人學者等，所謂上流子弟之流，則極力躲避軍役。我數萬學生，除醫科學生從事義勇兵者外，其他不過數名而已。加之革命黨已喪失軍隊威信，於是驅車歷三十日之行程，舉行盛大宣傳。其間，曾經滿洲邊野士兵中多數不識此爲何國領土，亦不知本身此行目的爲何，及與何國開戰。以如此情景，自無戰勝日本之理由。又謂日本方面，舉國一致，發揮愛國熱忱，靑年子弟，無不振作從軍。反觀我國靑年身體，偶有贏弱者，其母則爲之請求免服兵役，且尙有多數婦女前來，爲其子弟或丈夫請求免任戰鬥任務，而翼准予改服運輸隊及病院等勤務，企圖戰後安全返國云。</p>
<p>實則俄國敗戰原因甚多，大戰以後，美國公使曾謂日本之戰勝，乃恃於戰事發生後之實力，故日本之戰勝，由於統帥之卓越，將士之忠誠，已不待言。余並確信一半由於國民精神團結，士氣昂揚，堅具必勝信念，實爲最大要素，亦即天皇陛下親率之下，國民上下一致團結，其中名臣傾其良弼智謀，及名將勇敢善戰，卒使海陸打成一片，政戰兩略，協關善用，毫無遺憾，故得發揮帝國無上之威力。吾等今逢此重大戰局，自當痛感戰事嚴重，而努力爭取最後勝利。此次大東亞戰爭，係結集大東亞十億民族之總意，與盟邦德義兩國相互提携，對世界兩大强國美英匹敵，展開世界空前大戰，而如我祖先與强國俄國爭取同樣之勝利。美英自信具有豐富資源，及强大之生產力，故盎格魯撒克遜傲慢自負。殊不知戰爭之結局，其勝敗實胥視精神力，及戰爭意識之强弱，始可斷定。今之世界可謂每一國國家民族，均傾舉全力，以遂行戰爭。不惜捲入全面持久戰漩渦。大東亞戰爭亦已進入空前未有之深刻激烈狀態，戰局前途如何，吾人自不可輕予論斷。蓋近代總力戰，即全國國民，無一不爲戰鬥員，絕無前綫與後方之區別，今後國內後方，應預期敵方有形無形之所有攻擊，男女老幼，全國國民總武勝之日，已漸逼近戰爭以武力戰爲主體，直接戰力之質量及其運用爲決定之要素，已不待言。但戰爭中有近代持久戰爭，總力戰爭，最重要者爲國民之意志，即精神力，唯此始爲第一要義。關於此點，吾等在日俄戰爭已深得敎訓，亦爲此次戰爭所實地體騐者，必勝之信念與遭遇任何難局，皆毅然不屈之戰意，爲最重要之點。由全球上之戰爭狀態觀之，戰綫之渡瀾，一勝一負爲必然趨勢，一面戰爭一面準備戰爭之方策，尤爲吾人必備之主要條件。進言之，大陸方面現亦漸呈決戰塲地之情勢。據尼米茲聲稱，唯中國大陸始爲大東亞戰爭及世界戰爭之決戰塲，吾等在大陸當地，具有日本國民總前衛之任務，吾等之一舉一動俱有極重大之影響，軍官民各人皆須有此自覺，明瞭中國問題，可以爲戰勝最大關　，蓋如不能把握中國四萬萬民衆之心理獲得其信任，決不能完遂此偉大戰爭。就此意義而言，吾人實應以身表現帝國國民之眞姿態，吾人須知中國四萬萬民衆決無抗日排日亦化等情形，實爲純潔之羣衆，而此靜如湖面之中國社會，誠足爲反映吾等自身之明鏡也。　（完）</p>

<p>南京十一日中央社電　財政部次長陳之碩，於昨十一日下午二時，在該部接見中外記者，闡述該部最近施政概况，茲分誌如后：　緊縮銀行放款。現發現有多數銀行錢莊，作種種不規則營業，如囤積居奇等情事，經本部調查屬實，乃令中央儲備銀行，切實緊縮放款，務使趨於合理化，不再利用放款，從事操縱，刺激物價，自經實施，物價平均下跌百分之三十左右，今後本部對各行莊放款，仍極為重視，以取締不法行為。　淮海省中儲券流通問題。中儲券在該省區行使後，信用甚著，本月起又將中國聯合準備銀行券停止其新發行，故業務益為重要。刻中儲行除已在該地區設立徐州支行，及四個辦事處外，仍擬多設辦事處，促使運用圖滑。至外界邇來對中備券在該地區行使後，認為有刺激淮海與華北物價上漲之影響，此查屬過　。物價高漲决非幣制間題，對華北物價更無刺激之關運，因在此戰時下，物價上漲，由於來源困乏，及囤積操縱所致，倘囤積操縱者少，物價當然不致過昂。　水利建設經費，因目前開拓太湖，需款甚多，約一萬三千萬元，此外如治理運河，亦需款約一萬五六千萬元，財政部方面刻正在籌備中。籌措之法，决定發行建設公債。　農村貸款。關於農村貸款事宜，現交通銀行仍在積極辦理中，最近一二月來，約貸出一萬萬以上。　中日合辦公司之調整，對中日合辦公司之調整問題，財部籌款甚多，例如去年中華　業公司之改組成立，及最近華中水產公司重行調整等是，以後當有很多公司，尚待陸續調整，故將來所需費用，當然甚鉅，現亦在準備中。　消費特稅問題。國府為適應戰時財政需要，使國家財政收支相抵，特舉辦消費特稅，以裕國庫收入。現已在各大都市中開始實現，將來尚須逐步調整，使成中央稅收，以增稅　。際茲推行伊始，尚望各方援助協力云云。</p>

<h3>本市腦膜炎流行應採預防方法衛生局長袁昌談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊查邇來本市腦膜炎，流行猖　，本市衛生局局長兼第一區衛生處處長袁濬昌氏，以該症流行甚速，若不設法防範，勢將蔓延成疫，除呈請市政府撥款實施預防注射，並督飭衛生局暨衛生處全體人員，密切注意其發展外，並發表談話，盼市民合作採取預防方法云，茲錄如下：</p>
<p>滅傳染一大障礙</p>
<p>查本年之腦膜炎發現於杭州等處，近己侵入本市。勢甚猖獗。本局對該症之撲減，已動員全體工作人員，完成各項有效措置，惟對於下列各點，盼全市民衆予以合作。本症之起因。全由腦膜炎雙球菌之使入人體，此項病菌，在病人之鼻咽及腦　液內，均有發現，離開人體之後，即不能生存長久，故此症之傳染，必須與病人或帶菌者對面接觸，即有傳染之可能，（所謂帶菌者乃病菌巳傳入人身而表面尚無病狀者），故人均不知趨避，而不易控制與預防　　　撲減傳染病過程中之一大障礙</p>
<p>防禦方法縝密隔離</p>
<p>本癥之首要防禁法，乃立將患者縝密隔離，其最完善之辦法，莫如立即將病人送至隔離醫，若隣居有患者，而不明有不明之處，可用電話一二四一〇（防疫股）通知衛生處，該處即能予以協助。其次即為防範被帶菌者之傳染，其方法如下：　於可能範圍內，　力遭免至人口擁擠，空氣污濁，通氣設備不週之塲所。　隨時備帶口罩。　至指定之衛生分處，注射預防度苗。</p>
<p>學校當局友應注意</p>
<p>本癥因兒童及靑年感染較易，故患有常較成人為多，學校當局尤應深切注意，凡遇　生感染此癥時，應即勸告其家長立即予以隔離，一面迅即報告衛生處，如係在南市者，即報告南市衛生事務所，以便執行消毒，及其他必要措置，玆將隔離醫院詳細地址分別於下：　北海路（廣西路口）一六二號隔離醫院。　長安路（舊稱大西略）二十三號隔離醫院。　藍田路（舊稱馬斯南路）一九〇號隔離醫院。　華山路（舊海格路）四七六號（武康路口）上海地方醫院。　南市方斜路南市隔敵醫院。　閘北柳營路滬北傳染病院。全國商業統制總會，於日前召開全體理監事會議，各理監事鑒於成立以來，至本月十五日為一週年，因任期巳滿，决定辭職，聞辭呈業巳送是行政院請求照准。全體理監事之進退，自原定任期一年之點觀之，原屬不足稱異，惟理監事表明總辭職後，對於商統會今後之遝營上頗堪注目，物資統制審議會對該問題極其重視，將定期會議，預定日期為十三日午後三時在京舉行，對於商統會最高人事問題，將亟加處理。</p>
<h3>燈光管制時冒充警察向居戶檢查市民證盼市民謹慎防備</h3>
<p>近來燈火管制下，常有歹徒，手持電筒，冒充警察局派來向居戶檢查市民證，市民以為警察局派來，且昏暗莫辨，不疑有他，迨至啓門後，即遭搜刦，連日巳有數起，損失不資，其實警察局方面，决無在昏夜向居戶檢查市民證之事，灤望市民對於上項情事，先經嚴密盤詰，幸勿率自啓門，以遂歹徒　計，而免損失。</p>
<h3>燈火管制時燈火不得外防空本部促市民注意</h3>
<p>自本市實施永久燈光管制以來，市民對燈火管制，尚有若千須注意之點，市民防空本部當局，昨特發表談話如下：</p>
<p>由三月三日以來，施行戰時燈火管制及昨日（九日）第三次防空日燈火管制之成績而觀，遮蔽不究分之房屋，為數頗多，尤其為高大建築物上，燈光四射，諒係公寓旅館等之走廊天窗等處，光綫外洩，各該項建築物之管理人，務須特別注意，今後防空本部，當令保甲及其他人員出動，從嚴取締，對於違反者决予處罰，深望市民能了解燈火管制之意義，協力從事，是所至禱。</p>
<p>三月九日為第三次「防空日」，觀察各區所舉行創練之成績，有若干點尚須改良，應請市民更加切實注意，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>防火訓練</p>
<p>防火訓練於應付空中投下炸彈時之初期防火·影響極鉅，鑒於此種事實之為數甚多，故須舉行防火訓練，而實施是項訓練時，最重要之處，在於互相協助。本市市民負防衛大上海之實任，故應以防衛大上海之精神，培養其團結力，此節深望本市市民均能充分將認，同時謀技術上之進步，以有條不紊之團體行動為基礎，而加强精神之訓練。</p>
<p>訓練程度之高低，隨地點之不同彼而此互異。團體訓練之有人以一片熱心奮不願身為之指導者，雖技術方面尚多應予研究之餘地，而所見能出之以誠心誠意；堪以令人銘感者，亦復不少。</p>
<p>在一處有燒夷彈投下之地點，消防隊隊員之配置，仍感過多，如何能以最低限度之隊員達成此項任務，尚有研究之餘地。</p>
<p>水槽貯水</p>
<p>關於水槽貯水之補給，並未充分注意，一個水槽並無不必充足貯水之理由。</p>
<p>一面用水桶由水槽取水以灌救發生火災地點，另一方面由水源取水以補給水槽，此種方法，尤有加以研究之必要。各處所見之水槽，所貯之水，大都污濁，本街路之道路聯合會或本保內水槽所貯之水，均為濁水，此節殊堪令人赧顏。蓋該地幸未發生火災，水槽所貯之水不用以防火，倘或水管破裂，飲料無由取給之時，則必至於使用水槽之水為飲料，亦未可知，此點尤宜注意。</p>
<p>救護事宜</p>
<p>其次關於救護班之活動，亦為市民防空重要任務之一，亦有務須更加研究之必要，蓋救護事宜，在於爭一剎那以救人生命，若措置失宜，將使尚有生機之人，終至致命。</p>
<p>止血方法，尚須充分研究，防空木部當廣續切實指導各保甲內醫師，務希率先協助。至於担架一項，並無使用正式擔架之必要，門　或行軍床等，皆可改換應用，務須隨時研究，庶能臨機應變。</p>
<p>防空服裝</p>
<p>此次防空日，力勸華人民衆製備防空服裝，而民衆方面，大都漠不關心，殊為遺撼。防空本部所以大聲疾呼。說明防空服裝之必要者，無非為民衆着想，欲將未來災害，減至最低限度而巳。</p>
<p>民衆在訴說新材料購辦困難以前，務希利用原有材料，就預防災害，外觀悅目與節省費用三點考慮，裁製投己所好之防空服裝，此舉純為自身利益，幸勿忽視。</p>
<p>天窗洩光</p>
<p>最後所欲申言燈火管制，均漫不經心，華人住屋天留之漏洩燈光者，尤歷歷可數。須知一家不慎，足使萬家遭殃，而致無量贊財，葬於灰　。務希民衆立即設法，遮蔽天會燈光，倘他人有玩忽違章情事，並希　量告發，俾知遵守。</p>
<p>防空訓練成續，確有進步，誠堪欣慰，然現時階段，尚難滿意，切望於下次四月間防空日·能臻更為涵意之程度。</p>
<h3>棉布臨時配給四月初可實行配給手續己將準備就緒</h3>
<p>中央社訊商統會奉令收買棉紗棉布工作完畢後，對於各棉製品廠商及棉布商號配給事宜，巳由棉業管鉀處統籌計劃謂行，惟為應市民棉布需要起見，除整個棉紗棉布配給辦法，積極準備外，特辦理棉布臨時配給，將各棉布商申請保留一部份棉布，為臨時配給之用，並指定棉布零售商為零配處，每一市民配給棉布一丈五尺。玆悉該項棉布臨時配給手續，已將準備就緒，最遲四月初即可實行配給，其配給辦法，商統會已印就棉布購買證，按照配給米粉糖煤等辦法，將購買證發由當局按戶口配發。</p>
<p>歌詠比賽聘定評判委員</p>
<p>國府還都四週年紀念日，市宜傳處及市敎育局，為表示慶祝，並推行新國民運動歌曲起見，特會同舉辦本市中小學歌詠比賽。茲悉主辦當局，為求評判上之慎重，特聘請國立音樂學院李惟寗院長為評判長，另騁本市普樂專家陳洪梁樂音朱英徐威麟楊嘉仁史鳳珠沈雅琴諸先生為評判委員。</p>
<p>留日新聞實習員延期來滬</p>
<p>留日新聞實習員一行，原定於今日由京來滬，茲聞該員等因事滯京，故改期於廿日來滬。</p>
<p>上海公墓遷葬完畢</p>

<h3>星期評論（自第一版轉來）</h3>
<p>新四軍既是遣樣，那麼就要看××軍了。就我所知道的，××軍駐防的地方，假如沒有日本軍隊，他們便像失去奶媽的孩子，很容易給別人抱去。事實上××軍一部份長官不論師旅團，他們的看家本事是向地方要錢。客氣些的是每月要多少，責令當地行政人員代為攤派，不客氣的就將有資格的派兵請去，等拿出一筆驚人的數目，然後恢復他的自由。無如長官一塲麻將可以輸幾十萬，同時他們還有「太太」，從長官到伙夫，往往每人不止一個，太太要有一超百姓」的享受，例如　襪帶的扣子也許要用金的，於是老百姓的負担就可觀了。一個農民要出新四軍的「救國公糧」，要給××軍長官養他的「私房」部下，還要使長官在任意揮霍之下另有一些相當的積蓄。</p>
<p>聽說某處日本駐軍當局對於道一層略有所聞，很代抱不平，老百姓誰願意給搜刮，不得不出，反而表面還要掩飾着，裝做沒出，也眞够苦的了。正因為××軍「要錢不要命」新四軍「要命不要錢」，所以××軍捉到新四軍，有些便得錢放走，而老百姓更沒有誰敢得罪新四軍了，久而久之「新四軍」便成了一頂帽子，農民一被戴上只有花錢了事。</p>
<p>所以鄉下人的結論是：「××軍搶得吃，新四軍騙得吃，老百姓沒得吃。」「搶」和「騙」，分明前者是「豪奪」，後者是「巧取」。老百姓沒得吃的結果是怎樣呢？一部份讀書明理尚氣節的，便關起門來，東緊肚皮，高蹈田園，一部份便去「共」人家的，另一部份便去利用日本人做了「第二敵親日派」——先生所謂「漢奸」——共產和漢奸越多，老百姓越沒得吃，於是不得不再被二度吸收，道頗有些爭取民衆的意味，不過「共產」部是眞促成了，而中日的仇恨，是否能給那些「第二種親日派」解除了，還是一個問題。</p>
<p>以上所說，好像太着重軍事，不過一談到政治，便不得不牽涉經濟。現在誰都知道，做官單靠官俸，不管特簡薦委，一律養不活自己。但官眞不能做嗎，大官不能做，小官却不壞。一個縣長進帳已很可觀，就是小小區長也容易弄錢。鄉下尤其那班一面通「共」，一面聯「和」的兩棲類，一個個都發了財。他們代新四軍征收公糧，在裹面作弊，又代××軍經手派捐，憑一己喜怒，上下其手。</p>
<p>兩方面向老百姓收錢的人，往往相遇，但是互不侵犯，有時候道一方先收，還代那一方代表催促，或是帶一口信，敎鄉下人預備起來。最有趣的，有時兩方收捐的是同一個人，那個人左邊口袋裏放的是新四軍的公糧收據，右邊口袋裏，放的是××軍方面的捐款收條。先生許以為「聞所未聞」吧？這　是坐在大飯店大菜糧子上所能想到的！</p>
<p>中國是一隻桌水缸，必須太平到相當時日，這缸裏的水，因為汚物沉澱下去，才能飮用。日本在八一三左右無意用棒一搗，現在這隻缸裏，已經渾得一團糟了，日本還要拉上中國當做一個盟友，我恐怕如不是日本說等自騙自的，中國也就太平配日本的垂靑了。</p>
<p>本來「家醜不可外揚」，我現在對一個異國人說自己家裹的醜事，很覺心痛，可是，我在這時候對誰說呢？</p>
<p>苦命的中國人上</p>
<p>當然，我們也不能認為這　讀者的信，是百分之百的眞實，因為他願慮到我是日本人，而寫的。此外，此處不能寫出來的「胸中苦悶」，處在中國人的生活當中充斥着。</p>
<p>從這種「現實」的觀點來看，「勝利第一」和「革新第一」，究竟何是何非，是用不着再加　論而就該明白了吧！（魯譯）</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>（自殺？）</p>
<p>忽然想到這裹的眞人，慌忙地又自己打消了這種思想。是不會有遣種事情的。也决不可以有這種事情——</p>
<p>以後不但從隆夫自己，連他父親那裹，也沒有信息。從他父觀那裏甚麼通知也沒有，可以證明還沒得到隆夫的正確的消息。想到這裏，他那暗澹的心境，便要使他想到最惡的境况。</p>
<p>十八。九歲的靑年——在一生之中最容易保持純潔地友誼的時代。除去雙親以外，還要願到友誼的年齡。况且眞人是生在尊尚朋友之誼的鄉士。對隆失的運命，好像是自己身受似的一種沉重暗澹的心情。</p>
<p>近來對於星期六倒槓子，也不能樹立當初那樣的勳功了。星期日也不參加俱樂部的團聚，而自己在出中散步消遺着。</p>
<p>「谷學生，近來身體不大好吧？」有時候被S少佐這樣詢問着，而慌忙地裝出有精神的樣子。</p>
<p>「要使勁的，整齊脚步走！」有時候被週現的學生深重重地申斥着。</p>
<p>（追不可以的！）眞人自己也注意到自己那文弱態度，沒有缺乏氣力的地方麽—對這五省之一慚愧地自責着。</p>
<p>（九）自此又過了一年。</p>
<p>秋神又來訪江田島的時侯，眞人已經不是去年當時的樣子了。在那年的夏天，他回到故鄉去，聽到隆夫的行踪仍然不明確，但是他並不因此而感到過分的悲傷。並非忘却了同隆夫之間的友誼，是因為他己經不能只拘泥這一點瑣事了。</p>
<p>這不但是因為眞人的軍人意識較從前堅固起來了，並且世局不容許任何人變繼於私情的嚴重起來了，就現在那年的兵學校的署假，也比從前短縮了，在那短短的休假期聞裹，眞人已經從母親和四吉哥那裹，聽到二哥眞上郎在任地合灣已經應召出征去了的。</p>
<p>七月七日，　溝橋事件爆發時，並沒惑到如何地緊張，但是不久通州慘劇同大山大尉虐殺的事件勃起時，世間的情勢，完全改變了。連呼出氣息的工夫都沒有，繼續地上海陸戰隊的奮鬥，和渡洋轟炸，日軍百萬杭州　登陸的輕氣球在空中高高地浮着—八·九月之間，國民的血沸騰到沸點以上。臨時議會，即時通過二十萬萬四千萬元的事變追加預算，也是一個明證。</p>
<p>眞人已經不是「門外漢」了，所以對戰爭的關心也和一般人不同。那便是在胸中已經有了堅固地决心的態度。以為從自與奮，反倒是一種可恥的。不但是眞人，全體的兵學校的學生，都有這種敎養的。他們只有從分隊監事那裹聰到戰况的報告，和在大講堂裹看到的時事電影以外，對於現在進行着的戰爭，並沒有特別的知識。他們唯有沈默地用功，和努力自己的作業。</p>
<p>但是詳細的解剖起來，要和所謂「俗扯」一般的人，是不可同日而語的。雖然不能大聲塊發表出來，在心中都在祈禱着這戰爭繼續到自己畢業後的——都是這樣地祈禱着。</p>

<p>— 泰穆</p>
<p>腦膜炎微生驗為種鏟球菌，侵入血液立即散出毒素，進人腦膜即成腦膜炎·腦膜炎因性狀及細菌之稱有不同，種類頗多，普通略分為二：甲念性—患者於數小時內即可暴亡。乙慢性—病菌潛伏期及發病期可達二星期至一二月之久。其一般症狀，為頭部暈痛·　語·嘔吐·抽　·頸項强直·皮膚惑覺過敏，亦有皮膚上現出搬點者。</p>
<p>傳染途徑可分為二插：甲與病人接觸，乙健康人身上帶有本病細菌，然本人抵抗力强，未會染得，而將細菌暗中散播開去病菌大多由鼻腔，口腔侵入鼻粘膜，並達於扁桃腺，穿入淋巴管，血管，再進入腦膜。</p>
<p>預防方法：第一將患者隔離，其居室，衣服，用具均須嚴行消毒。健康人為預防計應注意下列各點：甲用百分之三過氧化氣液時時含最口腔咽顯。乙出外時戴口翠。內注射預防疫苗。但本病之疫苗其效力並不如霍亂，傷寒苗疫可靠。</p>

        <h1>1944.03.12</h1>
<h3>Anguish Within the Heart</h3>
<p>— Yoshiwara Tosuke</p>
<p>My humble compilation of Japanese language essays has been published with the assistance of Shen Bao and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute. A certain Japanese newspaper considered the book as "representing the opinions that the Chinese dare not speak, and the words they dare not say." But it also added, "Logically, the Chinese themselves know their inner voices better. To further improve the situation in East Asia, China, and the peace zone, the most important thing is their spontaneous outcry. Let the people of this nation cry out first! That's our call." In principle, I completely agree with this view. If the Japanese can cry out their inner voices, and the Chinese can cry out their voices, there would naturally be no need for me to act as a substitute. Leaving aside the Japanese issue for now, is it really possible for the Chinese to cry out their inner voices now? This is indeed questionable. For example, no matter how rampant corrupt officials are, if you slightly criticize them, you are considered to be violating the "victory first" "heresy," and the critic is falsely accused of being the "enemy's fifth column." Conforming and following the crowd is the best way to keep one's rice bowl intact in these difficult times. Now, even in a major newspaper like Shen Bao, some people say it is a breeding ground for "heresy." In such an era, asking the general Chinese population to cry out their inner voices is simply as illogical as asking a woman wearing a chastity belt to give birth. Of course, no one can deny that the Chinese themselves understand the inner thoughts of the Chinese people most thoroughly. No matter how diligently I, as a foreigner, work hard, I cannot truly understand the suffering of the Chinese people. However, there are still times when the Chinese have to rely on the pen of a foreigner like me to express their views, and this is due to an irresistible sense of anguish. I don't want to waste any more ink on this issue. If I introduce a pair of reader letters I recently received, you will know that what I'm trying to argue is not fabricated. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Sir, you are Japanese, and I am Chinese. I don't know you at all. I am writing this letter presumptuously. I think you will be surprised at first, but after reading this letter, you can at least understand the painful psychology of the people in the Chinese peace zone more clearly. In the future, when you have more insightful opinions, you can also have more material as a basis. At the same time, I can tell you the anguish in my heart - also the anguish of some Chinese people - to a Japanese friend who can say a few words for the Chinese, and I feel relieved."</p>
<p>Now in Shanghai, the Japanese are shouting loudly about the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and those in China who want to please the Japanese also let the Japanese hear the same "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." But what about the inner layers of the Chinese people?</p>
<p>In the countryside some distance from Shanghai. The villagers say: "We are really a republic now. Look! 'Co' 'Pro' 'Sphere', isn't it?" Whether the "Sphere" in these three words refers to the "sphere" of the national system, or something else, is beside the point. Let's first look at "Co" and "Pro".</p>
<p>The communist New Fourth Army is now like oil in flour, like lice in hair. In addition to the "core" part that they claim to be, there are also locally organized "militia" as "tentacles." What good is it for farmers to be militiamen? Half of them are forced to become militiamen, and half of them can do whatever they want when they become militiamen. For example, a militia battalion commander can decide to "execute" people at will. If they capture a city or town, the militia can arbitrarily demolish houses and take the good stuff. Of course, if the militiamen are tenant farmers, the unlucky landlord will have long been ripped off, and he can forget about collecting rent. (Continued on page 4)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Memorial Day. Speech by Minister Sanpin</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 10th, Central News Agency Telegraph – (Continued from yesterday) In addition, Minister of the Navy Yamamoto at the time described the situation of the Imperial Council meeting on February 4, Meiji 37 (1904) as follows: The Imperial Council meeting at that time was a solemn and fierce meeting, but the fierce debates of the members gradually calmed down. At that time, Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi reported to the Emperor that what His Majesty knew could not be firmly believed at present, but in fact, according to Ito Hirobumi, war was inevitable, and he could not sit idly by and watch Russia ravage him. Once the order was issued, everything was resolved. Therefore, the Japanese government, without any firm conviction of winning against Russia, still attempted to fight because it could not tolerate Russia's violence. It was based on the righteousness and also based on the collection and uplift of the surging national will. After the Sino-Japanese War, the people who suffered the humiliation of returning Liaodong due to the intervention of the three countries, above for the Emperor, below for the spirits of their fathers, brothers, and comrades, did not know fear, did not know resentment, united from top to bottom, and were deeply pleased in their hearts.</p>
<p>We further recall that in his memoirs written by General Kuropatkin, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army, after the war, he said: "The entire Russian people could not understand the purpose of the war, and therefore had a dissatisfied attitude towards the war, so that the generals in front could not get the assistance of the people in the rear. Although there were some volunteers in the army, these were all ordinary people. The so-called upper-class children, such as aristocrats, merchants, and scholars, tried their best to avoid military service. Among my tens of thousands of students, only medical students were volunteers, and others were only a few. In addition, the revolutionary party had lost the prestige of the army, so they drove for 30 days to conduct grand propaganda. During this period, most of the soldiers in the Manchurian border wilderness did not know which country this territory belonged to, nor did they know what the purpose of their trip was, or which country they were at war with. In such a situation, there was no reason to defeat Japan. He also said that on the Japanese side, the whole country was united and displayed patriotic enthusiasm, and all young people were invigorated to join the army. On the contrary, in our country, if a young man was weak, his mother would ask him to be exempted from military service, and there were many women who came to ask for their sons or husbands to be exempted from combat missions, and to be allowed to serve in transportation teams and hospitals, etc., in an attempt to return home safely after the war."</p>
<p>In fact, there were many reasons for Russia's defeat. After the war, the American minister once said that Japan's victory depended on its strength after the outbreak of the war. Therefore, Japan's victory, due to the excellence of the commander, and the loyalty of the generals, goes without saying. I am also convinced that half of the victory was due to the national spirit of unity, the uplifting of morale, and the firm belief in victory. That is, under the leadership of the Emperor, the people united from top to bottom, and among them, famous ministers devoted their wisdom and strategy, and famous generals were brave and good at fighting, so that the sea and land became one, and the political and military strategies were well-coordinated, without any regrets, so that the empire's supreme power could be brought into play. We are now facing this major war, and we should deeply feel the seriousness of the war, and strive for the final victory. This Greater East Asia War is the collection of the will of one billion people in Greater East Asia, and the mutual cooperation with the allied countries of Germany and Italy, competing with the two major powers of the world, the United States and Britain, and launching an unprecedented world war, just like our ancestors fought with the powerful country of Russia for the same victory. The United States and Britain are confident that they have abundant resources and strong productivity, so the Anglo-Saxons are arrogant and conceited. They do not know that the outcome of the war, its victory or defeat, depends on the strength of the spiritual power and the strength of the war consciousness before it can be determined. Today's world can be said that every country and nation is exerting all its strength to carry out the war. Regardless of being involved in the whirlpool of a full-scale and protracted war. The Greater East Asia War has also entered an unprecedentedly deep and fierce state, and we should not lightly judge the future of the war. The modern total war, that is, all the people of the country are combatants, and there is no distinction between the front and the rear. In the future, the domestic rear should anticipate all tangible and intangible attacks from the enemy, and the day when the national people will be victorious, regardless of gender or age, is gradually approaching. War is mainly based on armed warfare, and the quality and application of direct combat power are the determining factors, which goes without saying. However, in modern protracted warfare and total warfare, the most important thing is the will of the people, that is, spiritual power, and only this is the most important thing. Regarding this point, we have learned a deep lesson in the Russo-Japanese War, and it is also the practical experience of this war. The belief in victory and the will to fight indomitably in the face of any difficulties are the most important points. Judging from the global state of war, the turbulence of the battle lines, one victory and one defeat, is an inevitable trend. The strategy of preparing for war while waging war is the main condition that we must possess. To put it further, the mainland is now gradually showing the situation of a decisive battlefield. According to Nimitz, only the Chinese mainland is the decisive battlefield for the Greater East Asia War and the World War. We have the task of being the general vanguard of the Japanese people in the local mainland. Our every move has a great impact. Government officials and civilians must have this awareness and understand that the China issue can be the greatest concern for winning the war. If we cannot grasp the psychology of the 400 million people in China and gain their trust, we will never be able to accomplish this great war. In this sense, we should show the true attitude of the imperial people with our own bodies. We must know that the 400 million people in China have no anti-Japanese or anti-Japanese sentiments, they are pure people, and this quiet Chinese society is enough to be a mirror reflecting ourselves.

<h3>The Central Reserve Bank Tightens Lending, and Prices Have Fallen. The Ministry of Finance Decides to Crack Down on Illegal Business Operations of Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency Telegraph – Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Ministry at 2:00 PM yesterday, the 11th, to elaborate on the Ministry's recent administrative overview. The following is a summary: * Tightening bank lending. It has been found that a large number of banks and money shops are engaged in various irregular business operations, such as hoarding and speculation. After investigation by the Ministry, it was found to be true, and the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to effectively tighten lending, so as to make it more rational and no longer use lending to manipulate and stimulate prices. Since the implementation, prices have fallen by an average of about 30%. In the future, the Ministry will continue to attach great importance to the lending of various banks and money shops in order to crack down on illegal activities. * The issue of the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in the Huaihai Province. After the Central Reserve Bank notes were circulated in the province, the credit was very high. From this month, the issuance of China United Reserve Bank notes will be stopped, so the business is more important. In addition to establishing a Xuzhou branch and four offices in the area, the Central Reserve Bank plans to set up more offices to promote the smooth operation of the funds. As for the outside world's recent view that the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in the area has stimulated the rise in prices in Huaihai and North China, this is an overstatement. The rise in prices is not a currency issue. It has no impact on the price stimulation in North China. Because under this wartime situation, the rise in prices is due to the lack of sources and the hoarding and manipulation. If there are fewer hoarders and manipulators, the prices will not be too high. * Water conservancy construction funds. Because the current development of Taihu Lake requires a lot of funds, about 130 million yuan. In addition, the treatment of the Grand Canal also requires about 150 million to 160 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance is currently preparing for it. The method of raising funds is to decide to issue construction bonds. * Rural loans. Regarding the rural loan matter, the Bank of Communications is still actively handling it. In the last one or two months, about 100 million or more has been loaned. * The adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures. The Ministry of Finance has raised a lot of funds for the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures. For example, the reorganization and establishment of the China Industry Company last year, and the recent readjustment of the Central China Aquatic Products Company, etc. In the future, there will be many companies that need to be adjusted one after another, so the future expenses will certainly be huge, and preparations are also underway. * Consumption tax issues. In order to meet the financial needs of the country during the war, and to balance the national financial revenue and expenditure, the National Government has specially organized a special consumption tax to enrich the national treasury. It has now begun to be realized in major cities, and will gradually need to be adjusted in the future to become a central tax revenue to increase tax revenue. At the beginning of the implementation, we hope that all parties will help and cooperate.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in the Chin Hills Region of Burma Crosses the Steep Mountains, British and West African Forces Have Been Completely Suppressed</h3>

The enemy forces in the Tissim area were in the process of rotating with reinforcements at this time, so they were attacked by the Japanese army taking advantage of the situation. The enemy felt very embarrassed and became chaotic.</p>
<p>Yangon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Indian-Burmese front, because the main force of the British West African 81st Division invaded the Kaladan River estuary, intending to attack the Japanese army's flank, launched a counter-attack operation against it on the 1st, continuing to pursue the retreating enemy along the Pyuchaung River valley. The Japanese army, after occupying Saidaung, crossed the Kaladan River at a certain place, then turned sharply to the right to the northwest at a certain place, attacking north along the Kaladan River, and entered the key Kaladan at 8:30 PM on the 5th. They immediately occupied it and echoed the friendly forces of the enemy army fiercely fighting in the area on the left bank of the Pyuchaung River, completely suppressing the enemy army. At this point, the main force of the enemy army trapped in the area between the Kaladan and Pyuchaung has now lost its leading position, facing the same fate as the British 7th Division. Another Japanese army wants to occupy a certain key point upstream of the Kaladan from the Haka direction, and has already crossed the treacherous Arakan Mountains and is advancing forward.</p>

<h3>Ireland Responds to the United States, Still Adhering to Neutrality and Refusing to Close the German Consulate</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report citing news from the United States: The US government has requested Ireland to send the diplomatic personnel of Germany and Japan out of the country, saying that they "can easily facilitate espionage to detect Axis military actions."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: London broadcast news: Ireland has just refused to accept the US request and asked the Axis diplomatic representatives and consuls stationed in Ireland to leave. According to the same source, the US Minister to Ireland submitted the same letter to Irish Prime Minister Valera on February 21st, but Prime Minister Fan immediately verbally rejected the request in the US note. The US note stated that Ireland's neutrality is beneficial to the Axis powers and harmful to the United Nations, and expressed the hope that Ireland's request for the German and Japanese representatives to leave would have the same meaning as severing diplomatic relations. The Irish government replied that if it complied with the request, Ireland would be taking the first step in declaring war, so unless Ireland is disloyal to democratic principles, it cannot accept the US proposal. The Irish reply further stated that Ireland's neutrality represents the unified will of the Irish Parliament and is the reasonable result of Ireland's history and division of territory for the establishment of the country. According to the reply, Britain has notified the Irish government that it agrees with the US opinion.</p>

<h3>Enemy Bank Custody of Securities and Gold Bars The Japanese Side Begins to Return Them Japanese Embassy Authorities Issue a Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the foreign currency securities and gold bars held by various enemy banks were carefully reviewed by the Japanese authorities to determine whether there was an enemy relationship. Now that the review has been completed, it has been decided to start the procedure of returning the securities and gold bars of non-enemy Chinese and neutral countries from the 12th through the various clearing banks. This measure shows that the Japanese side respects and protects the legitimate rights and interests of non-enemies everywhere, which will also have a good response in terms of prices. The list of the clearing banks that act as agents for the various enemy banks is as follows: Enemy Banks Agent Clearing Banks Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Yokohama Specie Bank Mercantile Bank Imperial Bank Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China Bank of Korea Citibank Mitsubishi Bank Chase Bank Sumitomo Bank</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office authorities issued a statement yesterday saying: After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, when liquidating the banks of enemy countries, the foreign currency securities and gold bars held by those banks were temporarily withheld to review their enemy relationship. However, the authorities will respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of non-enemies and will return them as soon as the opportunity arises. This time, the work of reviewing the enemy relationship has been completed. After consultation with the relevant agencies, it has been decided to release the foreign currency securities and gold bars (including gold coins) held by non-enemy Chinese and nationals of neutral countries. However, among the foreign currency securities, those that can be returned are all public bonds, corporate bonds (including military-managed enterprise companies), and stocks of non-enemy enterprises, but stocks of enemy enterprises and military-managed enterprises are not included.</p>
<h3>Solemn Ceremony Held to Commemorate the Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death Municipal Government Plants Trees Today</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News Today is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. All agencies, groups, schools, and shops in the city are flying flags and holding memorial ceremonies. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has decided to hold a memorial meeting in the auditorium at 10:00 a.m. this morning. After the meeting, trees will be planted in the open space inside the government. The heads of all bureaus and offices under the municipal government will attend and participate.</p>
<p>In addition, the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality has also decided to hold a memorial ceremony in the auditorium of the association this morning. In addition to ordering the district party headquarters to send representatives to participate, all members and colleagues of the association, as well as the East Shanghai Branch of the Fourth Joint Team of the China Youth Model Corps, etc., will participate, presided over by Director Liu Yangshan. The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters will also issue a public letter to the people and will send personnel to various public places today to distribute it.</p>
<h3>Meningitis is Prevalent in the City Preventive Measures Should Be Taken, Says Health Bureau Director Yuan Chang</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News Recently, meningitis has been prevalent in the city. Mr. Yuan Junchang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and Director of the First District Health Office, believes that the disease is spreading rapidly. If preventive measures are not taken, it will spread into an epidemic. In addition to requesting the municipal government to allocate funds to implement preventive injections and supervising all personnel of the Health Bureau and Health Office to pay close attention to its development, he also issued a statement hoping that citizens will cooperate in taking preventive measures. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Eliminating Transmission is a Major Obstacle</p>
<p>Meningitis was found in Hangzhou and other places this year and has recently invaded the city. The situation is very rampant. The bureau has mobilized all its staff to complete various effective measures to suppress the disease. However, for the following points, I hope that all citizens will cooperate. The cause of the disease is entirely due to the entry of meningococcal bacteria into the human body. This bacterium is found in the nasopharynx and cerebrospinal fluid of patients. After leaving the human body, it cannot survive for a long time. Therefore, the transmission of this disease must be in face-to-face contact with patients or carriers, that is, there is a possibility of transmission (the so-called carrier is a person who has been infected with bacteria but has no symptoms on the surface), so people do not know to avoid it and it is not easy to control and prevent a major obstacle in the process of suppressing infectious diseases</p>
<p>Thorough Isolation is the Primary Defense Method</p>
<p>The primary preventive method for this disease is to immediately and thoroughly isolate the patient. The most perfect method is to immediately send the patient to an isolation hospital. If there is a patient in the neighborhood and there is something unclear, you can call 12410 (Epidemic Prevention Section) to notify the Health Office, which can provide assistance. The second is to prevent the transmission of carriers. The methods are as follows: Within the possible range, try to avoid going to places with crowded populations, polluted air, and poor ventilation. Always carry a mask. Go to the designated health branch to inject the preventive vaccine.</p>
<p>School Authorities Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Because children and young people are more susceptible to this disease, the incidence is higher than in adults, so school authorities should pay close attention. Whenever a student is infected with this disease, they should immediately advise their parents to isolate them and immediately report to the Health Office. If it is in Nanshi, report to the Nanshi Health Office so that they can carry out disinfection and other necessary measures. The detailed addresses of the isolation hospitals are listed below: 162 Beihai Road (intersection of Guangxi Road) Isolation Hospital. 23 Changan Road (formerly Da Xilue) Isolation Hospital. 190 Lantian Road (formerly Masnan Road) Isolation Hospital. 476 Huashan Road (formerly Haige Road) (intersection of Wukang Road) Shanghai Local Hospital. Nanshi Isolation Hospital on Fangxie Road, Nanshi. Hubbei Infectious Disease Hospital on Liuying Road, Zhabei. The National Commercial Control Association held a full board of directors meeting a few days ago. All directors and supervisors, considering that the anniversary since its establishment is the 15th of this month and their term of office has expired, decided to resign. It is said that the resignation report has been sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. The advance and retreat of all directors and supervisors is not surprising from the point of view of the original one-year term of office. However, after the directors and supervisors stated that they would resign en masse, the future operation of the Commercial Control Association is worthy of attention. The Materials Control Review Committee attaches great importance to this issue and will hold a regular meeting, scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the 13th in Beijing, to address the issue of the highest personnel of the Commercial Control Association.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Police Officers During Blackouts to Check Citizens' Certificates The Municipal Government Hopes That Citizens Will Be Cautious and Take Precautions</h3>
<p>Recently, during blackouts, there have often been villains holding flashlights and impersonating police officers sent to check citizens' certificates. Citizens thought they were sent by the police station, and because it was dark and difficult to distinguish, they did not suspect anything else. When they opened the door, they were searched and robbed. There have been several cases in recent days, and the losses are not small. In fact, the police station has never checked citizens' certificates in the dark. It is hoped that citizens will carefully question the above situation before opening the door, so as not to let the villains succeed and avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Urges Citizens to Pay Attention to Lighting Restrictions During Blackouts</h3>
<p>Since the city implemented permanent lighting restrictions, citizens still need to pay attention to several points regarding these restrictions. Yesterday, the authorities of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Judging from the results of the wartime lighting restrictions implemented since March 3rd and the third air defense blackout exercise yesterday (the 9th), a considerable number of houses are still failing to properly shield their lights. In particular, tall buildings are emitting light in all directions, likely due to light leaking from corridors and skylights in apartments, hotels, and similar establishments. The managers of these buildings must pay special attention. From now on, the Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch neighborhood chiefs and other personnel to strictly enforce the regulations, and violators will be punished. It is earnestly hoped that citizens will understand the meaning of lighting restrictions and cooperate fully.</p>
<p>On March 9th, the third "Air Defense Day," observations of the exercises held in various districts revealed several areas that need improvement, and citizens should pay closer attention. These are detailed below:</p>
<p>Fire Prevention Training</p>
<p>Fire prevention training is extremely important in the initial stages of dealing with bombs dropped from the air. Given the frequency of such incidents, fire prevention training must be conducted. The most important aspect of this training is mutual assistance. The citizens of this city bear the responsibility of defending Greater Shanghai. Therefore, they should cultivate their unity with the spirit of defending Greater Shanghai. It is earnestly hoped that the citizens of this city will fully recognize this point and simultaneously seek technical improvements, strengthening their mental training on the basis of organized group action.</p>
<p>The level of training varies from place to place. Some individuals are wholeheartedly dedicated to guiding group training, and although there is still much room for research in technical aspects, their sincerity is admirable and deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>At locations where incendiary bombs have been dropped, the deployment of firefighters still seems excessive. How to accomplish this task with the minimum number of firefighters still needs to be studied.</p>
<p>Water Tank Storage</p>
<p>Insufficient attention has been paid to replenishing water tank storage. There is no reason why a water tank should not be fully filled.</p>
<p>The practice of drawing water from water tanks with buckets to extinguish fires while simultaneously drawing water from water sources to replenish the tanks needs further study. The water stored in most of the tanks seen is dirty. The water stored in the tanks of the road associations or neighborhood within this street is all turbid, which is truly shameful. Fortunately, no fire has occurred there, so the water stored in the tanks has not been used for firefighting. However, if water pipes were to burst and drinking water could not be obtained, it is not impossible that the water in the tanks would be used for drinking, a point that deserves special attention.</p>
<p>First Aid Matters</p>
<p>Secondly, the activities of first aid teams are also an important task in citizens' air defense, and further research is necessary. First aid is about saving lives in a split second, and improper handling can lead to the death of someone who still has a chance to survive.</p>
<p>Bleeding control methods still need thorough study. The Air Defense Headquarters should broadly and effectively guide doctors within each neighborhood, urging them to take the lead in assisting. Regarding stretchers, there is no need to use formal stretchers; doors or cots can be adapted and used. Constant research is necessary to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>Air Defense Clothing</p>
<p>During this Air Defense Day, the Chinese populace was strongly urged to prepare air defense clothing, but most people remained indifferent, which is regrettable. The reason the Air Defense Headquarters is loudly advocating the necessity of air defense clothing is solely for the sake of the people, wanting to reduce future disasters to the minimum extent possible.</p>
<p>Before complaining about the difficulty of purchasing new materials, it is hoped that people will utilize existing materials, considering the three points of disaster prevention, pleasing appearance, and cost savings, to tailor air defense clothing to their liking. This is purely for their own benefit and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Light Leaks from Skylights</p>
<p>Finally, it must be reiterated that many people are careless about lighting restrictions, and the leaking lights from skylights in Chinese houses are clearly visible. It must be understood that one family's negligence can cause disaster for ten thousand families, resulting in the loss of countless property in ashes. It is earnestly hoped that people will immediately find ways to shield skylight lights. If others are found to be negligent or in violation of regulations, it is hoped that they will be reported so that they can be compelled to comply.</p>
<p>The results of air defense training have indeed improved, which is gratifying. However, the current stage is still not satisfactory, and it is earnestly hoped that the next Air Defense Day in April will reach an even more meaningful level.</p>
<h3>Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth Can Be Implemented in Early April: Rationing Procedures Are Ready</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that after the Commercial Control Commission completed its task of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, the Cotton Industry Management Office is planning the allocation of these materials to various cotton product manufacturers and cloth merchants. However, to meet the needs of citizens for cotton cloth, in addition to actively preparing for the overall allocation of cotton yarn and cloth, a temporary allocation of cotton cloth is being implemented. Cotton cloth merchants have applied to retain a portion of their cotton cloth for temporary allocation, and cotton cloth retailers have been designated as distribution points, with each citizen allocated one and a half yards of cotton cloth. It is learned that the procedures for this temporary allocation of cotton cloth are ready, and the allocation can be implemented by early April at the latest. Regarding the allocation method, the Commercial Control Commission has printed cotton cloth purchase certificates, which will be distributed to households by the authorities according to population, following the same method as the allocation of rice flour, sugar, and coal.</p>
<p>Song Competition Engages Judges</p>
<p>To celebrate the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and to promote new national movement songs, the Municipal Propaganda Department and the Municipal Education Bureau jointly held a song competition for primary and secondary schools in the city. It is learned that the organizers, to ensure the impartiality of the judging, have specially engaged Li Weining, President of the National Conservatory of Music, as the head judge, and have also engaged Chen Hongliang, Zhu Ying, Xu Weilin, Yang Jiaren, Shi Fengzhu, and Shen Yaqin, all local experts in music, as judges.</p>
<p>News Interns from Japan Postponed Their Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The group of news interns from Japan, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing today, has been delayed in Nanjing due to some matters. Their arrival has been rescheduled to the 20th.</p>
<p>Relocation of Shanghai Public Cemetery Completed</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony Held Yesterday The relocation project of the Shanghai Public Cemetery has recently been completed. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, a memorial ceremony for the relocation was held by a unit of the Japanese Navy, with the attendance of Mayor Chen, Director of the Health Bureau Yuan, and other related officials, as well as the commander of a certain unit of the Japanese side, the director of naval facilities, and representatives from the naval attaché office. The cemetery, with the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, was relocated to the Miaoxing Cemetery, and the project has been completed.</p>
<p>Recent News on the Compilation and Printing of the Huayan Commentary</p>
<p>The Huayan Commentary Compilation and Printing Association has been working on the project for over three years. It was originally planned to complete the entire book last winter, but due to a resolution by the association to add the Universal Worthy's Separate Practice Commentary to the end of the volume, and due to power restrictions at the printing house which shortened night work, the completion was postponed. Now, out of the 40 volumes of the complete book, 32 volumes have already been published, and the remaining eight volumes can be completed in about two months. The actual cost is 800 yuan per set. Those who previously donated 500 yuan and were entitled to one set must now pay an additional 300 yuan to receive the books. For postage to other locations, an additional 100 yuan per set is required. Donations have already been closed. Furthermore, the pooling of small donations to invite sutra chanters for meritorious deeds is no longer permitted.</p>
<h3>Second Class of Model Police Officers Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday: A Friendship Gathering Was Held in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Fifty police cadets from the second class of the Model Police Training School of the First Police Bureau of this city, having completed their training, held a graduation ceremony at the Police Club yesterday (the 11th) at 10:00 AM. Present were Mayor Chen (represented by Secretary Zhao), the concurrent Bureau Chief (represented by Director Du Zheng), Chief Su Chengde of the training school, Chief Secretary Zhao, as well as the heads of various sections, chiefs of various divisions, and all police cadets, totaling over 200 people. The First Police Bureau's orchestra played music. First, the attending officials were invited to view the exhibition of the police cadets' achievements. After the meeting began on time and the ceremony was conducted, Chief Su of the training school reported on the progress.

<h3>President Takashima of the National Policy Company Discusses the Adjustment of National Policy Companies and Expects Active Cooperation from Private Financial Circles</h3>
<p>President Takashima of the Central China Development Company went to Nanjing on the 6th to conduct various negotiations with the relevant authorities of the National Government regarding the final discussion on the adjustment of Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies. As a result, a general agreement has been reached, so Mr. Takashima returned to Shanghai on the 9th and issued a statement on the adjustment issue on the 10th. The gist of the statement is as follows: The adjustment of the Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies in Central China has been delayed until now due to various reasons and has not yet been realized. Now, a consensus has been reached between China and Japan on the specific adjustment details, and it is expected that it can be realized soon. However, since each company has its own special circumstances, the form of adjustment will also be different. Changes in personnel and capital are being fully considered in order to adapt to the new relationship between the two countries after the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. During the first adjustment, the enemy's Central China Silk Company was regulated to be independently operated by the Chinese side, which proceeded extremely smoothly. The adjustment of the National Policy Companies is of great significance in the economic cooperation between China and Japan. It is hoped that the Chinese financial circles will actively cooperate with these important national policy enterprises. In the future, the Central China Development Company will implement investments in important production sectors that also greatly contribute to increased war power, and implement various plans to increase production, according to the adjustment of the companies it manages. Regarding the funding required for this, the Central China Development Company Law has been amended in the Japanese Diet, and the limit for issuing corporate bonds has been raised, so there is a considerable surplus. Mr. Takashima intends to compensate as much as possible with local funds. He recently negotiated with the Chinese production country to facilitate funding, and if necessary in the future, he intends to have a Chinese bank underwrite the entire process.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Variable Method for Company Capital Increase Registration</p>
<p>Regarding the company capital increase registration, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established restrictive measures and has announced their implementation. It is learned that these measures have been approved by the Ministry to be variably implemented to adapt to the commercial situation. According to petitions from merchants in various regions, companies that have already convened shareholder meetings before the announcement and implementation of these measures, and have even collected share capital, may find it difficult to fully comply with the restrictions stipulated in these measures. If these measures are strictly applied, the previously processed capital increase procedures will inevitably become invalid, and the collected share capital must be returned, not only incurring losses but also affecting their reputation. They earnestly request variable handling. After detailed review by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it was determined that the statements were true. Therefore, in order to balance convenience and benefit, it is specially stipulated that if the minutes of the shareholder meeting and public notices are submitted to prove that the resolution to increase capital was indeed made before the announcement and implementation of these measures, and that all capital increase procedures were indeed in progress, the Ministry may variably handle the matter to adapt to the commercial situation.</p>
<p>Public Corporation Dynamics</p>
<p>Since the dissolution of the Central China Silk Company, there has been no unified organization for the centralized control of silk procurement, which has greatly affected market prices. Before the official establishment of the China Silk Company, twelve silk merchants will jointly organize a Silk Trade Association, and all organizations are in the process of being established. It is expected to be established by the end of this month. In this way, there can be a temporary measure for centralized procurement.</p>
<p>The preparatory work for the Paper Trade Association of this city has been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road to discuss the association's charter and elect the first board of directors and supervisors.

<h3>Need for Educational Assistance Increases Daily: This Newspaper Expands Educational Assistance Services and Publicly Elects Mr. Shen Yougan to Preside Over All Matters</h3>
<p>In the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), two students from the Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center, Bao Jia Zeng and Wu Geng Sheng, appealed to this newspaper for financial assistance because they were eager to learn but burdened by economic difficulties. They were met with the utmost compassion from the readers of this newspaper, who generously donated funds for educational assistance. At that time, this newspaper, recognizing the widespread enthusiasm of readers for supporting out-of-school children and the inevitable and urgent need for assistance from impoverished students, wondered why this newspaper should not take on the responsibility of communication and expand its appeal. After discussion among colleagues, the Educational Assistance Movement was launched. The success of this movement should be attributed to the readers, but the genesis of the matter was due to the two young people, Bao and Wu. Since its inception, it has been six terms, and over 14,000 students have received assistance. Observing the social situation, the need for educational assistance is increasing daily, and the number of students seeking assistance is increasing. In the near future, this newspaper's service for educational assistance will inevitably expand. We have specially consulted with Mr. Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Yang Nielingyu, Zhao Zongyu, Chen Qingshi, and Shen Yougan of the Educational Assistance Fund Committee. The committee publicly elected member Mr. Shen Yougan to be stationed at the newspaper office to preside over all affairs of the Educational Assistance Fund. Mr. Shen is a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Stanford University in the United States and has served as a professor at Guanghua University and Zhejiang University, a lecturer at Harvard University in the United States, and the Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. He is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. From now on, he will pay close attention to the selection of assisted students, their studies while in school, and their career choices after graduation. The assisted students should know the enthusiasm of the readers who donate funds and the purpose of this newspaper's service, which is solely to cultivate talents for the future of China. Therefore, they should strive to make progress in order to live up to the high expectations of society. As for the guidance on studies and career choices, the methods will be published in the newspaper one after another after they are determined. We also hope that readers will give us their valuable opinions from time to time so that we can follow them. This newspaper is fortunate. The country is fortunate.</p>

<h3>Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>If the New Fourth Army is like that, then we have to look at the ×× Army. As far as I know, in places where the ×× Army is stationed, if there are no Japanese troops, they are like children who have lost their nanny and are easily taken away by others. In fact, the specialty of some officers of the ×× Army, whether they are division, brigade, or regimental commanders, is to ask for money from the locals. The polite ones ask for a certain amount each month, ordering the local administrative personnel to apportion it on their behalf. The impolite ones will send soldiers to "invite" qualified people, and only restore their freedom after taking a staggering sum of money. However, the officers can lose hundreds of thousands in a single mahjong game, and they also have "wives." From officers to cooks, often each person has more than one. The wives must have the enjoyment of "surpassing the common people." For example, the buckles of their garters might have to be made of gold, so the burden on the common people is considerable. A farmer has to provide the New Fourth Army's "patriotic public grain," support the ×× Army officers' "private" subordinates, and also enable the officers to have some considerable savings under arbitrary spending.</p>
<p>I heard that the Japanese garrison authorities in a certain place have heard a little about this level and feel sorry for the people. No one wants to be plundered, but they have to pay up, and even have to pretend on the surface that they didn't, which is really hard enough. Precisely because the ×× Army "wants money, not life," and the New Fourth Army "wants life, not money," when the ×× Army catches members of the New Fourth Army, some let them go after getting money, and no one among the common people dares to offend the New Fourth Army anymore. Over time, "New Fourth Army" has become a label, and a farmer only has to spend money to settle the matter once he is labeled.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion of the villagers is: "The ×× Army grabs to eat, the New Fourth Army deceives to eat, and the common people have nothing to eat." "Grabbing" and "deceiving" clearly mean that the former is "violent robbery" and the latter is "clever extortion." What is the result of the common people having nothing to eat? Some who are educated, reasonable, and have integrity will close their doors, tighten their belts, and live a secluded life. Some will go to "communize" other people's property, and others will use the Japanese to become "second-class pro-Japanese elements"—what the gentleman calls "traitors." The more communists and traitors there are, the less the common people have to eat, so they have to be absorbed a second time, which is quite meaningful in terms of winning over the masses. However, "communization" has been truly promoted, and whether the hatred between China and Japan can be resolved by those "second-class pro-Japanese elements" is still a question.</p>
<p>What I have said above seems to focus too much on military affairs, but once we talk about politics, we have to involve economics. Now everyone knows that officials cannot support themselves solely on their official salaries, regardless of whether they are specially appointed or recommended. But is it true that one cannot be an official? One cannot be a high-ranking official, but being a minor official is not bad. A county magistrate can already make a considerable income, and even a small district chief can easily make money. In the countryside, especially those amphibians who are both connected with the "Communists" and allied with the "Japanese," are all making a fortune. They collect public grain on behalf of the New Fourth Army, cheating in the process, and they also handle the apportionment of donations on behalf of the ×× Army, manipulating it according to their own likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>The people who collect money from the common people on both sides often meet, but they do not infringe upon each other. Sometimes one side collects first and even urges on behalf of the other side's representative, or sends a message, teaching the villagers to prepare. The most interesting thing is that sometimes the same person collects donations from both sides. That person has the New Fourth Army's public grain receipt in his left pocket and the ×× Army's donation receipt in his right pocket. The gentleman probably thinks it is "unheard of," right? This is something that can only be imagined while sitting in a grand hotel eating a sumptuous meal!</p>
<p>China is like a vat of water. It must be peaceful for a considerable period of time before the water in the vat can be drunk because the dirt has settled down. The Japanese unintentionally stirred it with a stick around August 13th [1937], and now the vat is a complete mess. The Japanese still want to pull China in as an ally. I'm afraid that if Japan isn't just deceiving itself, China wouldn't be worthy of Japan's favor.</p>
<p>Originally, "one should not wash one's dirty linen in public." I feel very heartbroken now that I am telling an alien about the ugly things in my own home. But, who can I tell at this time?</p>
<p>A miserable Chinese person</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot think that this reader's letter is 100% true, because he is apprehensive about my being Japanese and writing it. In addition, the "anguish in the chest" that cannot be written here permeates the lives of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>From this "realistic" point of view, which is right and wrong, "victory first" or "innovation first," should be understood without further discussion, right? (Translated by Lu)</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>(Suicide?)</p>
<p>Suddenly thinking of this, he hurriedly dismissed this thought again. There won't be such a thing. And there can't be such a thing—</p>
<p>After that, there was no information from Longfu himself, nor from his father. The fact that there was no notification from his father proved that he had not yet received accurate news about Longfu. Thinking of this, his dim mood made him think of the worst situation.</p>
<p>Eighteen or nineteen years old—the age at which it is easiest to maintain pure friendship in life. In addition to parents, there is also the age of friendship to miss. Moreover, Zhenren was born in a homeland that values friendship. He felt a heavy and dim mood, as if he himself had suffered Longfu's fate.</p>
<p>Recently, he has not been able to establish the same merits as he did at the beginning when doing gymnastics on Saturdays. On Sundays, he does not participate in club gatherings, but takes walks outside to relax.</p>
<p>"Student Gu, you haven't been feeling well lately, have you?" Sometimes he was asked this by Major S, and he hurriedly pretended to be energetic.</p>
<p>"You have to work hard and walk in formation!" Sometimes he was severely reprimanded by the students.</p>
<p>(This is not allowed!) Zhenren himself also noticed his weak attitude. Was there a place where he lacked strength? He felt ashamed and blamed himself for one of these five shortcomings.</p>
<p>(9) Another year has passed since then.</p>
<p>When Akigami visited Etajima again, Zhenren was no longer the same as he was last year. In the summer of that year, he returned to his hometown and heard that Longfu's whereabouts were still unclear, but he did not feel excessively sad because of this. It was not that he had forgotten the friendship between him and Longfu, but because he could no longer be bound by this trivial matter.</p>
<p>This was not only because Zhenren's military consciousness had become stronger than before, but also because the world situation did not allow anyone to continue to indulge in personal matters. Even the summer vacation of the military school that year was shortened compared to before. During that short vacation, Zhenren had already heard from his mother and his brother Sukeji that his second brother, Zhenshanglang, had been called up and had gone to his post in Taiwan.</p>
<p>On July 7th, when the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, he didn't feel particularly nervous, but soon when the Tongzhou Massacre and the murder of Captain Oyama broke out, the situation in the world completely changed. There was no time to even exhale. Continuing, the struggle of the Shanghai Marines and the transoceanic bombing, the light balloons of the million-strong Japanese army landing in Hangzhou floating high in the sky—between August and September, the blood of the people boiled above the boiling point. The provisional parliament immediately passed a supplementary budget of 200,400 million yuan for the incident, which is also clear evidence.</p>
<p>Zhenren was no longer an "outsider," so his concern for the war was different from that of ordinary people. That was the attitude of having a firm determination in his heart. Thinking that being behind in participation was a shameful thing. Not only Zhenren, but all the students of the military school had this kind of education. They only heard reports of the war situation from the squad supervisor and saw current affairs movies in the lecture hall. They did not have any special knowledge of the war that was currently going on. They could only silently study and work hard on their assignments.</p>
<p>However, when dissected in detail, they were not to be compared with those who were so-called "vulgar." Although they could not loudly express it, they were all praying in their hearts that the war would continue until after their graduation—they were all praying in this way.</p>

<h3>Understanding Meningitis</h3>
<p>— Tai Mu</p>
<p>The meningitis microbe is a kind of streptococcus. Once it invades the blood, it immediately spreads toxins. When it enters the meninges, it becomes meningitis. Meningitis varies in nature and bacterial name, and there are many types. It is generally divided into two categories: A. Acute—the patient can die suddenly within a few hours. B. Chronic—the incubation period and onset period of the bacteria can last for two weeks to one or two months. The general symptoms are dizziness and headache, stuttering, vomiting, convulsions, stiff neck, and sensitive skin. Some also have spots on the skin.</p>
<p>The routes of transmission can be divided into two types: A. Contact with a patient. B. Healthy people carry the bacteria of this disease, but their own resistance is strong, and they have not been infected, but they secretly spread the bacteria. Most of the bacteria enter the nasal mucosa through the nasal cavity and oral cavity, and reach the tonsils, penetrating into the lymphatic vessels, blood vessels, and then into the meninges.</p>
<p>Preventive measures: First, isolate the patient, and strictly disinfect the patient's room, clothes, and utensils. For the sake of prevention, healthy people should pay attention to the following points: A. Use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to gargle the mouth and throat frequently. B. Wear a mask when going out. C. Inject preventive vaccines. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine for this disease is not as reliable as the cholera and typhoid vaccines.</p>
