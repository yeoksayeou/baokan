<h3>星期評論從巴爾幹談到遠東</h3>
<p>— 趙繼聖</p>
<p>問：自從羅馬尼亞．保加利亞相繼與蘇聯講和，英國軍隊在希臘登陸以來，蘇聯與英美之間的磨擦日益深刻，試問英美蘇三國的未來國際關係，將如何發展？　　答：英美和蘇聯之間，根本有最大的矛盾存在；而現在巴爾幹半島的磨擦，祗不過是基本矛盾的一種表現而已。即就戰爭目的一點而言，英美的作戰目的和蘇聯的作戰目的，已經有根本不同的地方。英德之戰在前，而蘇聯之戰在後，這是時間上的不同。英德戰爭爆發前，蘇聯已經和德國締結了互不侵犯條約，英德戰爭爆發後，蘇聯與德國更締結經濟及其他各種條約，這可證明蘇聯在戰爭初起時，根本還沒有與英美共同合夥的企圖；及至徳蘇戰爭爆發，英美在旁鼓掌，希望德蘇兩國同歸於盡，這又是表明英美並不希望蘇聯在歐洲抬頭的絕大明證，且更足證明英美蘇在政策上、心理上的根本矛盾。既然各方面都暴露着矛盾，則英美蘇的［聯合陣綫］當然是偶然的結合；偶然結合的結果，當然可以隨時分離，且戰事愈是進展，雙方的矛盾亦愈益明顯，而分離的可能性亦愈益增多。所以巴爾幹半島英美蘇的利害磨擦，不過是將來英美蘇三國拆夥的一個端緒而已。要解決英美蘇在歐洲的根本矛盾，我認爲是絕對不可能的事。　　問：不過，根據最近英美對蘇的政策看來，無論在政治上，經濟上，不是儘量對蘇聯讓步嗎？　　答：不錯，英美現在與德國作戰期中，無論在任何方面，都不得不表示對蘇好感，所以爲避免暫時的磨擦起見，必須對蘇讓步。譬如波蘭問題，就是最好的一個例子。但是，英美的此種讓步，決不是沒有限度的，其所以繼續對蘇讓步的原因，還是因爲沒有達到最高的飽和點。英美還要利用蘇聯的力量來和德國作戰，同時更欲利用蘇聯的力量來消耗蘇聯自己的元氣，這是英美在歐洲的陰謀。可是，事實並不像英美所想像的那樣簡單。蘇聯在歐洲的勢力範圍一天擴展一天，同時與英美的磨擦也一天增多一天。我們單以巴爾幹一地來看，即可證明。蘇聯欲劃巴爾幹半島爲其勢力範圍的企圖，決非自今日始。蘇聯在過去數十年中所最期望的事，乃是尋找海口的出路。蘇聯在歐洲的海口出路並不多，祗有北冰洋，波羅的海，和黑海。北冰洋終年冰結，波羅的海氣候不良，黑海須經過土耳其的兩海峽，這三個海口都不是理想中的出路。所以蘇聯垂唌巴爾幹的最大原因，亦即在此，此次在東部戰綫緊張之際，不惜亦重兵進攻羅馬尼亞；結果羅馬尼亞降服，保加利亞不久也對蘇講和，蘇聯多年來的慾望，也達到一部分。可是，問題就在這裏。蘇聯一旦控制了巴爾幹以後，對於英美，尤其是英國，將發生絕大的衝突。地中海是被英國一向視爲囊中物，近東諸國是英國的物資寶庫，土耳其更是被英國視爲近東的屏障；但是蘇聯一旦藉巴爾幹而涉足地中海的時候，無論對地中海，對土耳其，對近東諸國，在英國看來，都是一種嚴重的威脅，並且此種威脅是英國致命威脅，非加以限制不可。這裏就展開了英蘇間的暗鬥。日前英國軍隊在希臘登陸，就是英蘇暗鬥的啟端。所以我說，英美雖然還在對蘇讓步，但是英美越是對蘇讓步，越是足以證明英美蘇關係之日趨惡化。　　問：英美蘇的關係在歐洲是如此，在遠東又是怎樣？　　答：蘇聯在歐洲所採取的政策，不能毫不變更地實施到遠東。蘇聯的國策重心是在歐洲，而不在亞洲；歐洲是處於戰爭狀態中，亞洲則反之。這一點須予以注意的。所以蘇聯在歐洲雖然在名義上是與英美站在同一戰綫上，但在遠東就不能那樣簡單。譬如英美在過去雖竭力使蘇聯參加他們的［四強會議］，但是史太林祗參加過德黑蘭會議，而未曾到過開羅；祗看見蘇聯和英美三國會談，而未曾見到［四強會議］實現；美國雖然屢次向蘇聯要求提供遠東航空根據地，但事實上毫無反響。凡此種種，都足以證明蘇聯在遠東所採取的政策，正與英美背道而馳。其最大原因，還是因爲蘇聯與日本之間，還保持著中立條約的關係。　　問：日本雖然與蘇聯保持中立關係，但是現在正是日本與英美的作戰期間，而英美蘇三國又在歐洲與德國作戰中，同時德國又是日本的同盟國，試問在這種複雜微妙的國際關係之下，日本與蘇聯的外交關係又是怎樣？　　答：我認為日本與蘇聯之間，不但已經締結了中立條約，並且在事實上雙方更將繼續維持中立條約；這不是條約自身的關係，乃是日蘇兩國的利害完全一致的緣故。蘇聯在歐洲是在作戰期中，所以不但沒有東顧的必要，並且更無暇東顧；日本在亞洲亦在與英美作戰中，而作戰的地域又在南洋方面，所以更需要北境的安全。爲了這種緣故，日蘇兩國在利害上既完全一致，中立條約的繼續維持，乃是極合理的事。蘇聯政策既定，無論英美怎樣要求蘇聯提供航空根據地，要求蘇聯參加［四強會談］。甚至不惜對蘇加以［停止供給武器］的種種威脅，蘇聯依舊維持現在的中立條約而毫不爲之動。這不單是因爲蘇聯和英美之間有根本的矛盾；事實上，史太林深深感覺到：蘇聯在遠東倘若有所仿傚英美的舉動，這不僅非蘇聯之利，並且更將遭受到嚴重的後果。</p>

<h3>物價評議會通過抑平物價方案當局將採斷然手段強制現價</h3>
<p>本市物價評議委員會，爲商討抑平物價之有效措置，於本月十八日下午三時，在經濟局會議室舉行第十一此委員會議，出席委員計有徐主任委員天深，市政府參事潘達，警察局副局長虞英（張玉齋代）物品配給處處長馮攸（孫郭武代），衛生局局長袁溶昌，水產管理局局長劉偉俊，市商會理事長袁腹登，銀行公會秘書長林康候，與論界代表陳彬龢，中央儲備銀行經理戴　庫，商統會理事長聞蘭亭（李社虞代），米糧統制會主任委員陳國權（潘孟翹代），粉麥統制會主任委員孫仲立（單哲代），油糧統制會主任委員陳子彝，日用品統制會主任委員羅訥齋等二十餘人。首由主席徐天深報告物價近況，及緊急措置方針後，開始討論：一關於抑平物價治本方面，（甲）呈請中央疏通物資來源，（乙）獎勵增加生產。治標方面，請經濟局會同經濟保安處嚴厲取締囤積操縱及超越限價，決議通過。二建議市府設法增加米煤食油配給，議決通過。三評定本市公定商品品目價格九十六種，議決通過，分呈市府及實業部備案。強制限價</p>
<p>記者昨向有關當局探悉，當局對抑平物價，已抱最大決心，將採取斷然手段，強制限價，各物價格經物價評議會評定，呈准當局核准後，各業商店均須確切遵照，盡量出售，並須將物品限價格表掛於顯明處，使市民對照限價購物，如有不法奸商，膽敢超越限價，或有貨拒售，或將貨黑市賣買，以及業外人囤積等情事，一經查實，當予最嚴厲處置。澈查囤米</p>
<p>日前本市米價忽然上漲，旋又暴跌，顯見有人從中操縱，市民莫不痛恨，聞市經濟局已接獲情報，有某某奸商米藏，肆意作囤積食米，高抬米價等不法行爲，特會同經濟保安處密查，從嚴緝究，行見此輩敗類，難逃法紀，而本市之米價將更趨低落。</p>
<h3>徐經濟局長談食米物價關係及當局最近決定措置</h3>
<p>日來當局對米價物價問題，正積極研討，力謀應付，市民對此甚爲關切，各報會提出若干有關商業統制之問題。聞商統會即將派員出席記者例會，加以說明，中央社記者以物價與食米有密切關係，復走謁本市經濟局長徐天深氏，叩訊市府最近對本問題之措置，承徐氏逐項答復如下：政治強力戢止漲風</p>
<p>一問：徐局長前所作物價報告，對於物價病征診斷，至爲正確，藥方亦甚好，到底有無有效措置之藥料？　　答：我前報告係出褚君之迫問，僅以我一年之經歷，作坦白之敘述，人之不肯言者，我亦言之，非向壁虛搆，危害聳聽，以圖賽責。我意此事體大，蓋欲促各方面之注意，共同研究，共同圖究，而勿作諱疾忌醫，使病情日臨危重，至於我的責任方面，我仍不斷努力，且積極進行，決意用政治強力，戢止漲風，凡有意綫可通之路，我都必尋求進行，我的職權所能至者，必極力運用至無餘地，望褚君多多指教及巨助。以事實請褚君指教</p>
<p>二：問：徐局長所謂有效緊急措置，可得聞其祥否？　　答：我是一個實踐者，非一理論家，我任職一年來，在我賢明長官領導之下，切切實實去幹，絕不多發談話，最好坐言起行，我以爲最好行而不言，作一個淵默宏毅的人。對於此事，關於整個的，我講盡我之經驗，竭誠貢獻，關於局部的，待至緊急措置時，以事實請褚君指教。人民道德心責任心</p>
<p>三問：本市奸商特別聰明，常利用政府法規之漏洞，社會之弱點，而塞口與取巧，徐局長所謂有效措置，應十分祥密，否則他們將有所藉口而逃避，徐局長以爲然否？　　答：誠然，本市爲全國精華所在，商人亦特別聰明，有許多流幣事情，固然係制度缺陷而生，亦社會道德薄弱所致。但凡政府所定之法規條文，都是一個原則，人民能否遵守，視人民之愛國心責任感而決定。我一生至反對人言聰明，至好以實心辦實事，我次次對於物價問題，除同時指出病原與施行強力整治，雙管齊下外，仍欲在喚起人民道德心責任心，此點亦是褚君之職責也。肅清米蠢抑平米價</p>
<p>四問：米貴一切商品都很高貴，徐局長對於目前米糧黑市貴至極峯，有否辦法？　　答：米糧有米糧統制機關，本非我所管，我相信米糧當局必有良策，褚君必要我言，我以爲米食目前黑市上漲，並非來源缺少，亦非本然之貴，據報各地產米區秋收豐登，米當局亦正在努力改善採運方法，其貴之焦點，完全係意中人爲的操縱。我以爲一切物價上漲，即米價黑市上漲之傳染所致。此傳染病的微菌，就是米蠢。全國人在希望米平，並在努力米平工作，獨米蠢在製造米貴至續言，操縱米價，以圖暴利。自市面傳出政府將改善米之採運方法，及市長令飭配給當局依期配給二種消息後，本市米之黑市第一次由二萬三四千元落至一萬八九千元，第二次由一萬八九千元落至一萬五六千元，以此更足以明證米貴，並非本然，而是人爲的。又各地米價以本市漲落爲漲落，我相信各方拿出良心來，多方努力，共同作穩定工作，本市米黑市必落一萬元以內，各地更必低。我以爲要抑平物價，必先抑平米價爲不刊之論，我將出力協助米當局而作穩定米價之工作。我亦有一屑欲言，米糧爲軍食民命所托，現在前方軍事節節勝利，在大東亞戰爭決勝階段，我全國政府人資之責任更應積極，不應去容米蠢之從縱，更不應作米蠢之行爲，使軍需民食都感困難，我認爲凡利用米價而發財，與只顧一家溫飽，多存過量之米，而不顧全國人民之啼饑與軍食者，均是米蠢行爲。一個民族國家有此喪掉良心的米　，實民族國家之最劣種，（不獨無道德心，且亦犯罪值最大者。）民族國家有此劣種，何足以言獨立自主，何配言同盟資格，所以我主張要供應軍食，必肅清米蠢，爲使人民食平米，必肅清米蠢，爲恢復國民道德心，必肅清米蠢，爲要求獨立自由，必肅清米蠢，爲完遂大東亞戰爭，亦必先肅清米蠢。我認爲政府經濟一切施政，自肅清米蠢始，我目前只抑平物價，我認米蠢爲我們第一個惡敵，欲除此傳染病，應行全面的清除米蠢工作，我望全國起來撲滅此傳染病之微菌（米蠢），再進而用政治強力，抑平一切物價，一定有成績，望褚君協助政府，去作陳琳討米蠢得檄文。配給米的加價問題</p>
<p>五問：聞配給米將行加價，有勁物評會統一否？如然，米價恐難配給品價格，在現在物價管理制度之下，各自規定，不俟得物評會同意，米之價格亦然。我前報告書中已略爲言之，我認爲凡公定一物一品價格，必須兼顧一般物價水準，並須根據該物該品之成本會計，此在我的立塲不願加價，況加價則一切商品成本關係，與勤勞階級工薪，都有所影響，但此是事實問題，米當局必有所斟酌，不必過濾也。</p>
<h3>戶口米今日發售二升售一百元</h3>
<p>本期戶口配給處連日趕辦簽發派貨車，及出貨手續就緒，定自廿二日至卅一日，舊一區市民得憑第廿三號碼相同志食米零賣處，領購秈米或糯米或糙米二市升，共價國幣一百元正。所有舊糧食局配給區域，因正在調整發證手續，不及發售，稍緩數日，另行公佈發售。又該區域內所有配給市民之煤球黃豆肥皂等，亦將於日內人別補行發售</p>
<h3>掃蕩美英艦隊預祝會第一日今日下午五時繼續舉行</h3>
<p>上海欣慰聯合會，工商聯誼會，市民福利協會，爲喚起國人，集中總力，以徹底剷除英美起見，爰於昨（二十一）日起假靜安寺路大光明電影院繼續舉行掃蕩美英艦隊預祝會三日，。昨爲大會之第一日，請松島艦隊報道部長，及市政諮詢委員會常務委員陳彬龢二氏演講（詞見今日週刊第一版），歷時一小時，聽講民眾莫不振奮靜聽，演講畢，乃放映華影新片［重逢］。今日爲大會之第二日，下午五時仍在大光明舉行，請中日兩國海軍代表中央海軍學校校長姜西園中將，及艦隊報道部監田大尉兩氏演講。　　理事長陳曉崑，呈控，卅一年十二月七日，市商會呈請市府取消該組合佣金，卅二年一月十九日，上海社運分會呈市府制止該組合強征捐稅，一月廿一日財政部函請市府查辦非法勒捐柴樹在案，本年五月十五日水上保甲第五區，及樹柴業同類公會理事長張文學等，連名呈市府及行政院查究，均正辦理中。該會以柴炭爲本市市民必需品，近來以煤球質量不足，市民多以柴炭爲炊事之基本燃料，如此非法剝削，影響市民生活至鉅，除一面繼續調查該組合黑幕外，已函請市府徹底查究取締，以儆奸商，而疏民困。</p>
<h3>本市各界後日追悼頭山滿</h3>
<p>本市各界爲追念日本國士頭上滿翁功績，表示哀思起見，特由市府秘書處，市黨部，市宣傳處，東亞聯盟上海分會等發起，定於本月二十三日上午九時，在江寧路玉佛寺舉行追悼儀式，屆時各界代表均將參加，儀式隆重。</p>
<h3>諮詢會請澈查樹柴漲價黑幕柴炭組合設卡勒索</h3>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，對本市市民日用必需品價格只飛漲，極爲焦慮，並分別逐一研究平抑辦法，近以本市樹柴雜柴等燃料，售價暴漲不止，該會據市民密告，查係由於中央市塲所屬之樹柴雜柴炭業集配出資組合，違背定章，變相設卡，勒索手續費，增加成本，影響售價之結果。據查中央市塲集配出資組合設立要綱，凡委託市塲出售之貨物，概由各集配出資組合，依照市塲所評定之價格收買之。所有收買貨物應征收定額之手續費，配給與市塲所指定另售商，並經該市塲規定，柴炭應收手續費爲百分之二．五。近查該柴炭組合，並不按照評定價格收買，祗在本市市區四周，成立辦事處，凡有柴炭運至市區，即行勒索手續費，並且溢額收取百分之三．五，已成變相稅收機關，收入極豐，致引起同業之不滿。曾於卅一年春，由雜柴同業業公會</p>
<h3>短評燃料爲何暴漲</h3>
<p>據今日所載消息，市政諮詢委員會接到市民告密，中央市塲所屬之樹柴雜柴炭業集配出資組合，對於柴炭運入，違背定章，變相設卡，勒索手續費。因此，柴炭增加成本，暴漲不已。請求諮詢會設法。該會一面調查黑幕，一面函　市府徹底查究取締。　　燃料爲市民生活必需品之一，與食米同樣重要，近來煤斤固因來源缺乏，供求失調，價格飛漲。但是，柴料的來源幷不如煤斤這樣缺乏，而價格也是出乎意料的飛漲，我們正疑有人操縱囤積，不料以中央市塲的附屬機構，竟敢違背定章，公然勒索，致使燃料價格高漲，影響市民生活，尤其是一般平民爲甚。　　食米與燃料的價格，是一般物價的中心，有領道一般物價漲落的作用。際此物價暴漲之時，對於刺激與掀動物價上漲的因素，絕不容存在，尤其對於投機囤積，違章勒索等事，市府更應從速取締，并依戰時擾亂經濟罪從嚴懲治，以儆效尤，而平物價。</p>
<h3>印政府週年紀念印僑昨慶祝</h3>
<p>昨（二十一）日爲自由印度臨時政府成立週年紀念，本市全體印僑二千餘人，於上午九時集合於靜安寺路跑馬廳內，舉行盛大慶祝儀式，本市各界計到有陳市長代表宣傳處長梁秀予，盟邦日本駐滬陸軍部長川本少將代表出淵陸軍報道部長，松島海軍報道部長，松平情報部長，廣田中尉，中川中尉，義大利駐滬總辦代表拉比斯等，於高唱印度國歌聲中，印獨立同盟上海支部長却特親自升旗行禮如儀後，全體靜默一分鐘，祝禱爲參加大東亞戰爭及爲印度獨立自由而犧牲將士，旋由該支部長却特致詞，後由川本少將祝詞。（詞見今日週刊第一版）</p>

<h3>日海軍必勝信心準備寂滅敵美松島部長在預祝會演詞</h3>
<p>日阱華艦隊報道部松島部長在昨日［掃蕩美英艦隊預祝會］中，發表演詞如下：［今日新聞聯合會主辦舉行掃蕩美英艦隊預祝會，本人能參與盛會，有申述所懷之機會，實感欣快。今番台灣及菲島海面海空大戰，獲致偉大戰果，敵第三艦隊之機動部隊遭受殲滅，爲戰爭前途不勝慶賀。第三艦隊大部寂滅</p>
<p>綜合大本營發表戰果，共炸沉轟毀航空母艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，又擊破航空母艦八艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦四艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，艦型不詳者是一艘，其他起火焚燒者不下十二艘，在海上擊落敵機一百十二架以上，共計艦艇五十七艘以上，因航空母艦沉沒而喪失之敵機，恐不下一千架，三萬名以上之美國精銳部隊，葬身魚腹，此次襲台灣及菲島之哈爾賽第三艦隊，大部份已遭寂滅。如次重大損失，對於敵人之打擊，如何嚴重，由於敵人宣傳工作謊亂，以及關於受到損失緘口不言，即可窺見一斑．羅斯福在十六日會見記者時，對於北法登陸作戰，出示各種資料與模型，加以說明，記者所提出之質問，竭力避免答覆．又是七日尼米茲司令部發表稱：在台灣方面雖受日機日夜攻擊，但我戰艦及航空母艦，並不受到甚大損害云．又據是日新德里廣播，宣傳美國艦船不受任何損害，此與夏威夷及玻根維爾海戰後，美海軍首腦部取緘默態度，似出一轍，誠令人齒冷。惟我大本營公佈戰果，自己所受損失，亦堂堂公開發表，即大宮島，迭尼安島，吉爾勃脫島，日軍全體陣亡赤予事實發表，美國國內民眾對於日本大本營所公佈戰況，亦漸表信賴，以日方廣播，轉播各地，由此亦可知美國宣傳，有極多矛盾。敵人遭受嚴重影響</p>
<p>此次敵人作戰可說已進入太平洋最後決戰塲面，其主要攻擊方面，當然在於自菲島直通中國大陸之中央突破綫。以前敵人在帛琉及摩羅泰方面之企圖，可視爲序幕，然敵人迄未能達到帛琉本島，僅在其外圍培里琉島等小島上，已蒙基重損失，艦艇喪失十艘，陸上部隊二萬名以上。羅斯福爲了焦急戰局之進展，又要防重慶動搖，更爲十一月七日總統選舉之政治上問題，乃不得不出以急進突破太平洋之一策。敵方計劃以哈爾賽第三艦隊猛衝琉球及台灣，企圖切斷日本本土至台灣間之接濟路綫，並誘出日本聯合艦隊與之決戰，一俟戰果擴大，將再以第五艦隊直衝菲島方面，粉碎日軍陸上基地，並出動運輸航團，然後輕取菲島。右翼在台灣東方已遭受打擊，其右翼當然可謂爲敵太平洋上之主力，是世界代表的艦隊，彼等抱有必能勝於日本聯合艦隊之自信力，今敵人喪失此精華，今後作戰上將有嚴重影響，固可想像者。日本海軍必勝信心</p>
<p>現敵人以左翼拼死企圖突然菲島一角，但其左翼比較以前對付塞班島時，更爲薄弱，一時突入地形複維之菲島，投入日精銳陸海守備隊羅網，於我方言，誠屬殲敵之絕好機會。今次台灣東方海面作戰，一瞬轉變爲菲島方面之殲滅戰，我日本海軍以必勝之自信力，與滅敵之意氣態度自若，準備邀擊。同時中國大陸作戰亦勝利，今後戰局必能擊滅敵人。今日參加盛會有一點衷心表示感謝，即是中國朝野之不惜協力，尤其努力物資之流通，生產之加產，運輸之增進，即於一般民生方面忍耐電熱燃料交通貪　等一切不自由，一億貢獻一切於作戰。此次戰果，當然是中日通力合作之戰果，敵方英美將盡各種手段，挽回頹勢，因此今後中日兩國將來之命運，本人切望褚君熱烈協力。帝國海軍之大戰果，將可阻止美軍在中國大陸登陸，使褚君脫出戰爭火坑，使中國回復本來面目，日本人並望重慶亦作如是觀，轉變政策，實現全面和平，以奠定大東亞之建設基礎］。</p>
<h3>堅定必勝信念迎台灣大捷陳彬龢演講詞</h3>
<p>這次台灣海戰的詳情，剛才松島部長已經說得很明白。我們對於這次台灣海面的勝利，與大東亞戰爭的關係，應有深切的認識。　　近兩月來，敵美在太平洋的攻勢，漸趨熾烈，固然是事實。未有識者咸認戰局之嚴重情勢，並不如一般人想像者之甚。在長期戰中，戰局上局部之得失，實不能影響全局。太平洋戰局，因爲戰塲是廣闊浩瀚的海面，勝負的決定，自未可以某一島嶼的得失爲轉移。現在敵美西進愈深，離其本土愈遠，補給綫愈長，接濟就愈困難。反之，日本方面不僅保有開戰以來的優越形勢，且其戰爭指導當局之隱忍自重，決心靜待時機，於敵軍一再深入至絕對威力圈內，然後以向未出動的精銳猛擊敵軍。多數權威軍事家，過去即作如此的觀察這次台灣海面大捷，更足證明這種觀察的正確。　　我們觀察敵美此次大舉空襲台灣的目的，不外有四點：第一，羅斯福企圖在太平洋冒險作戰，僥幸取勝，作爲競選四屆總統的手段。第二，探求向中國大陸登陸的近道，以圖挽救中國大陸美渝軍之敗勢。第三，偵察日軍本土防衛綫之虛實，及企圖破壞台灣之航空基地設施。第四，敵美海軍戰略之最要者，乃爲誘導日海軍主力會戰。　　現在日軍旣獲空前勝利，敵美之目的顯無實現可能。同時此次日軍在台灣確保偉大戰力，則今後中國大陸就得以保衛。所以，我們在中國人民的立塲，更應重視。　　再則二十日小磯首相在東京國民大會席上演說中說：［目下日軍在中國雖仍在作戰，然而作戰非以中國民眾爲敵，亦非以中國軍隊爲對象，甚至不依賴英美勢力，雖重慶軍隊，亦不以之爲敵。渝方不特未能認識中國本身之真正敵人，反而爲真正敵人所驅使，妄自對日本發動無益之抗戰，致使真正敵人愈益跋扈，關於此點，深抱遺憾。］日本當局對於戰爭對象，已經分判得極爲明顯。我們爲加緊協力大東亞戰爭，我們應該做到兩點。　　第一，堅定勝利信念，不爲任何謠言所動搖。我們勝利的把握，絕非偶然的。最近蘇聯軍事專家相爾瑪西夫，會論美攻菲的困難，說的很爲客觀，即美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資於十月十六日對美國週報主辦的時事議論大會中也承認對日作戰勝利之途徑尚遠，而且艱難尚多。第二，我們凡對於大東亞戰爭中又不利者，絕對不做，凡對於大東亞戰爭有利者，必須努力去做，共同努力爭取大東亞戰爭的全局勝利。</p>

<p>上海日陸軍部長川本少將，在印度臨時政府成立周年紀念慶祝會，致詞謂：［自由印度臨時政府，於昭南成立以來，業經一載，今日欣逢一周紀念，本人略致蕪辭，以伸祝意。回顧自由印度臨時政府成立以來之一年中，戰事已進入決戰階段，東亞之天地，亦在多事之秋。拉鮑斯領袖指導下，克服各種困難，健全發展，不但爲四萬萬印度國民，並爲東亞褚民族慶賀。自由印度臨時政府之地位日臻強化，爲解放祖國而鬥爭，此均爲江特拉鮑斯領袖等指導者指導有方，東亞各地印度人愛國熱忱，以及各盟邦援助，有以致之。然更應提出者，爲自由印度臨時政府立主以武力對抗英國，蓋英帝國欲以印度作其心臓，藉恣意榨取，所以茍欲驅逐英國必須恃武力，過去的失敗主因，在於輕視武力，今自由印度臨時政府採取武力，一改以往方針，本年仁巴爾之役，印度國民軍協助日軍之戰績，以及予敵人之打擊，是可證明臨時政府之方針絕對正確。目下距［進擊德里］尚遠，但本人深信臨時政府如堅之一日。英國目視新生印度蓬勃氣象，刺激印度國內國民民心，故釋放甘地翁，以安人心。但英國正圖支配印度的野心，更加明顯。當茲英國在印勢力日趨沒落之時，美國起而代英國，亟謀霸制世界，握住印度之政治經濟支配權，吾人相信美國懷有與英國相同之野心，應以正義力量粉碎之。自由印度臨時政府成立以來，日本政府不惜予以全面協力支援，今日自由印度臨時政府進入第二年的階段，對其過去之光輝與未來的前途，表示慶祝，並望攜手共進，寂滅英美，完成大東亞戰爭］。</p>

<h3>經濟學士</h3>
<p>— 朱麟</p>
<p>前年秋天，在參加堂兄的婚禮時，姑夫給我介紹一位我自己也不明白底細的遠親。　　［說起來英傑是你的表哥］　　姑夫的話還沒有說完，表哥的臉上已堆滿了笑容，立刻週給我一張精印的打名片。</p>
<p>ＸＸ大學經濟學士　　　　　　潘英傑　　［那我沒有名片，很抱歉！］　　［那裏話，都是自己人。］</p>
<p>幾天之後，表哥來訪，說［旣是親戚，不該太疏遠了。］　　其實，他真真的目的是在跟爸爸說：［表伯是金融界的前輩，還請提拔機會］　　爸爸問他：［你以前曾在什麽地方服務？］　　［還沒有呢！但在學校裏也曾和同學一起做過公債和股票。］　　爸爸優點不高興的問他：［你是那一年畢業的？］　　［今年剛畢業，］但他略略躊躇了一下：［可還差一篇論文。］　　［那你的論文做好了嗎？］　　［是的，已經動手啦！］　　［做的是什麽題目？］　　［經濟概論。］　　［你是怎麼論經濟的呢？］　　［經濟．．．］他偏過頭向理想才說：［經濟的範圍太廣了，政府有政府經濟，學校有學校經濟，商店有商店經濟，戰爭有戰爭經濟，．．．概括地說終不外乎是管錢　錢那一會事。］　　持重的爸爸破例地笑了笑，經濟學士也似乎發現了杜撰的理論出了毛病，就趕緊接着聲明，［論文實在是請一個朋友在起稿，暑假裏忙着找工作，沒有安定的時間來做論文了。］　　爸爸有點不耐煩的站起來，随着和他說：［我要到行裏去辦公了，有了機會就通知你。］又回頭叮嚀我：［好好和表哥談談。］</p>
<p>那年冬天，爸爸才接手兼理行裏附屬的一個企業公司，表哥又來訪問了，那張［ＸＸ大學經濟學士］的卡片似乎更大了，也許是論文已經交卷了吧！　　爸爸正在吃飯，看了那張卡片搖搖頭說：［麟兒，去回說我不在家。］　　［二表弟好啊！表伯在家嗎？］還是他先迎了起來。　　我當然回說不在家，於是他掏出一封信要我轉交給爸爸後就匆匆辭去了　　信是姑夫寫的，希望爸爸在企業公司爲英傑安插一個相當的職位。　　也許爲了姑夫關係吧！爸想了一回和我說：［打個電話告訴姑夫，英傑如果願意到地產部去做事的話，明天到行裏來見我</p>
<p>英傑進公司的時候，正是股票慘跌而地產活躍的日子，於是，經濟學士的表哥得以施展他的手腕，在短時期內疚獲得了主任的信任，處理着地產進出中比較重要的事務，但，不到幾個月，公司裏却暗中盛傳着他曾在公司的交易裏帶帽子，沾油水，撈進了好幾筆不算少的外快　　接着，他又挪用公司裏的公款做股票，經濟學士的看法是地產旣是那麼活躍，股票決沒有永久停滯的可能，因此，他是大量的補進，可是，事實却正相反，低潮之後的低潮，使他祗能死抱住那些不值錢的花紙苦等，但公司裏不能等他了，就在主任的偶然發現下，宣告了他命運的第一個終結。</p>
<p>去年暑假，我因爲探望在鄉間養病的姐姐到嘉與去，在車站上買了票正因爲擠不進月台而焦急時，人羣裏忽然有人照呼我，回頭一看，却是經濟學士的表哥。　　他知道了我的困難之後，就很容易的把我在另一個門口引進了車廂，而且在他的二等車廂裏佔到了一個靠窗口的好位置。　　他這才告訴我，他正聯絡着一種勢力在販運西藥和顏料到ＸＸ去，一個多月來回一次，可以淨賺四五萬，他說：［如果賺不到錢，我在學校裏念什麼經濟學？我又何必做什麼經濟學士。］　　就是對於［挪用公款］那件事，他也是以同樣的論點來體諒自己的，他很感慨的說：［我作了一個堂堂的經濟學士，難道祗能在寫字問做一個小職員，每天僅低聲下氣的去抄寫那無窮的帳冊嗎？我旣是學經濟的，我就不能不在經濟上轉念頭，找出路呀！］　　看來，那時候，他在經濟上的出路是挺好的，從服飾，氣概，手面上都可以嗅出一種正在爆發的氣息，何況，就是那一次從ＸＸ回來，他還特意送過我們二只上好的蔣腿。</p>
<p>不久，命運對經濟學士却宣告了第二個終結。　　英傑的大批西藥在ＸＸ被海關抄到了，一百多萬貨物全充了公，ＸＸ方面還派人來找過他，因爲他犯了走私的罪。　　姑夫傳來消息時慨歎地說：［心太狠了，手裏有了五六十萬也可以了，又何必那麼貪呢？］　　不過，表哥並沒有因此忘記他是學經濟的，憑着他的神通，很快的就在ＸＸ局弄上了一個肥缺，僕僕於京滬道上，很忙碌了一陣子。　　據說，他在半年裏就弄到了那麼四五百萬的鉅款，在ＸＸ公園附近頂了一幢挺闊氣的洋房，迷上了一個什麽咖啡館的歌女，結了豪華的婚。　　這都是我在奉爸爸之命去道喜時聽到的話，我正想告訴表哥：［經濟學到底沒有辜負你。］但那天嘉賓如雲，事實上他沒有和我說上三二句話。　　距他說話不滿一個月吧，就發生了舉國轟動的ＸＸ舞弊巨案，沒幾天，經濟學士也不能不撇下他的金屋嬌妻去　　鐵窗風味了。　　接着，是嬌妻捲逃，金屋查封，存款凍結的消息。　　最後又來了［串同舞弊徒刑十年］的判決。　　這是命運對於經濟學士宣告第三次的終結。</p>
<p>在暗黑的牢獄裏，經濟學士現在正度着他悠悠的歲月，今天，他也許會懊悔了。</p>
<h3>［飆］創刊號評介</h3>
<p>— 海雀</p>
<p>○新型綜合性刊物［飆］是最近創刊中頗予人良好印象的一本雜誌。封面的形式設計首先給人以不平凡的感覺，單字的刊名也在說明主辦者和編者是不拘於陳規而富於革新的勇氣和魄力的。扉盡［希望］是力合熱的結晶，在圖裏面蘊藏着無比的青春的剛毅和力量，給人們帶來了信心和希望。［末路］作者唐敏之，他的作品在別的地方發表過很多，並且都很成功，而在這篇裏却得到了更高的表現。唐萱的苦悶的對白，寫情感的變幻旣複雜又曲折的，價可說是無微不至。燕居草作者袁鷹的作品，我們在本刊上矣讀了很不少，這次在該文中更給我們帶來了新穎的氣氛。　　○［飆］在大體上說是一本頗值一看的雜誌，編選的謹嚴固如上述，就是在編排的設計上也是破費心機而化變繁多的，但絕少庸俗氣，印刷的清晰和行款的疏朗也給讀者以輕鬆地快感，這些都是值得向讀者鄭重推薦的。</p>
<h3>晨思一章</h3>
<p>— 曉尼</p>
<p>○．．．．清晨的散步時輕鬆地，我慢慢地閒布在僻靜的柏油街路上。幽靜的四周沒有一些煩囂喧鬧，在這大城市難有的實貴的清淨中，我可以抬頭凝望一片蔚藍的天空，我可以腳踏着沉寂的地面上的簏沙，我可以拾起一塊石子用勁的擲了去，．．．．在這境地中我可以自由自在地活動。是的，我確是真正享受了這可愛的清晨，我瞧着兩旁那些緊閉着的窗門和瘋狂一晚疲乏了的［隔夜人］，我不禁投以鄙視的眼光，．．．．而我深深地吸了一口氣，湧現起勝利的自傲的內心的微笑。　　○．．．．我愛清晨，我也愛夜晚，我覺得自然所賦與人類的一切安排都是可愛的，祗要你能適宜地藝術地把握運用它，譬如說夜晚吧，的確有許多人厭嫌它暗黑沒有生氣，但夜晚的可愛處就是在幽靜，整天忙碌，疲倦了的身子在這時可以靜靜地休息，緊張忙昏了的頭腦漸漸地清淨下來，你很可悠閒地跌入了深思，想想自己也想想別人，想想過去現在或將來，．．．．毫無束縛地把你的思念帶到遼源遼源得地方去，旣而你可撇下了一切的雜念舒暢地享受一個甜蜜的愉快的夢，翌日你又精神突奕地參進了活動的隊伍。我經驗過失眠的苦痛，因此更愛夜晚，極力地使它有節奏的度過，人生的每一時刻都應有高尚的目的，（高爾基語），難道能縱放這佔有人生一半時間的夜晚嗎？因之對於那些在夜晚荒淫無恥瘋狂姿樂的人們，燃起強烈的憎恨，對自己也就格外的愛護起來，我自信在這人生的旅程中我會時時刻刻的把握導引着自己，不使走錯了一步而後悔一輩子的．．．．．。　　○．．．．我無意的又走進了家門，突然一陣急促的按鈴聲靠近了我，送報人回身把報授與了我，笑嘻嘻地塌車疾馳了去。　　○．．．．這是一份當日的報紙，明晰的鉛字告知了新聞消息和其他，啊，多沉重的報紙！我沒有拿起來閱讀，在眼前立即浮現了許許多多的活動爲着完成一張報紙的報館內的活動，外勤新聞記者在往來匆忙地採訪新聞，職內勤的在那暗黃的燈光下趕寫着，擠着腦汁，排字工人揉着捏忪的睡眼在揀着铅字，校對員對着螞蟻似的小字堆睜大着眼睛尋找着錯誤，一次，二次．．．時鐘［滴滴搭搭］在緊催着，最後隆隆地轉動着機器印出了一份份的報紙，如今這報紙是在我的手裏，但它是已絞盡耗費了多少人的心血勞力，就在每天可愛的夜晚，有着這麼許多人犧牲着爲人類服務．．．．。　　○．．．．我一向自信着我會好好地過完這一生，至少不會對不起別人和自己，但在對照相較下我又顯得多麼自私渺小，自以爲了不得的，郤祗是單純的發展個人自己，我會歌頌享受夜晚，我會憎恨淫佚浪用夜晚的人，但我郤未曾想到犧牲着夜晚的享受來爲人羣服務，我感到深深的慚愧了！</p>

<h3>體育申報盃籃球聯賽評述上週甲組各戰</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球上一星期中，甲組各塲，極見精彩，而每賽球迷紛筙當局感到無限與奮，茲評述上週間之組各戰。中北仁餘告捷同北Ｖ隊敗北</p>
<p>週一兩塲，中北戰同仁。前者一以球員有事，二以以爲穩操勝利，故僅到五員將士，宣家班則除原之全班人馬外，復得陸大振助陣，於是精神方面，相形之下，乃有盛衰之別，宣家班臨大敵不亂，發揮［黑馬］精神，中北心虛之下，幾爲所算。幸賴球運尚通，乃得以四十六對四十小勝同仁。次塲仁餘逢Ｖ隊，前者以馬林之走，實力大損。Ｖ隊新與後起，實力相將，演出遂成緊張，仁餘終賴經驗勝人，獲得勝利，比數爲二十八對二十一。華聯發揮威力明星光芒四射</p>
<p>週三之夕，有冠軍希望之華聯藥廠迎華影隊。員工作類多在夜間也。此戰中又有譚永湛包松圓王學武等缺席，零落不堪，振作無由。反之，華聯藥廠全軍在張溎祥集中訓練之下，各方面俱有長足之進步。對於戰術之研究，更有顯著之成功。職斯之故，華聯藥廠在此戰中發揮威力，華影軍精神雖佳，力不如人，徒喚奈何。比賽結果，華聯藥廠竟以六十一對九之比數大敗華影，亦爲華影有史以來最慘之一幕，可見華聯之實力。另幕明星同仁會仗，後者在　元燦宣艾候爾氏訓導之中，無懈可擊。明星有周文璣之領導，球員精神，殊見與奮，兩軍交餒，宣家班賴射手宣通之順利，分數始終扶搖直上，唯在上半時將終了時，健將陸大振四次犯規罰出，乃致不可收拾。明星隊乘機崛起，頓見光芒四射，沈達史久全八面威風，後來居上，以六十九對五十九敗宣家班，可謂得意之作，無怪周文璣之笑顏遂開。汕隊擊退大華仁餘再接再厲</p>
<p>週五夜，汕隊與大華之戰，嚴重言之，有關冠軍之得失。最低限度，季軍之爭，可毫無疑問也。且以兩軍之助威對特多，以故是夜籃球房中，熱鬧情形，爲申報杯創最盛之一幕。　　論兩隊戰術，大華爲脫胎於百樂門之作風，採人釘人戰略，如有充沛之長力，以其隊員之資格而論，揚威申報盃，稱霸籃球壇，極爲可能。惜乎如陸鐘恩許文奎陳祥龍俱等有力不勝任之狀。汕隊係後起之秀，其長處正與大華相反，球藝顧未臻爐火純青，而氣力之足，以年事之正青，堪稱雄厚。是役也，上午時中大華恃氣力之尚能應付，人釘人應付裕如，汕隊之智力不逮，於是大華以十三對七告捷，非爲過望抑有贏分尚不足之感。蓋下半時以氣力之關係，記者早料汕隊必有所焉。果爾，下半時開始後，大華漸見長力不如，汕隊小將，愈戰而愈勇，大華力不從心，中間更以調人失策，頻頻換人，尤以調下張邦倫，而用許文奎，最爲失策。蓋阿奎之現狀不佳，用之於人釘人籃球戰況中，決難討好。於是汕隊將士，漸入歷境。以阿奎之漏洞頻漏，爲陳清江周斌連袂利用獲分累累，得以三十七對二十四克服大華焉。大華之敗在於力，非智之不足。智仁餘華影會師，後者還是吃虧在人馬不齊。前者挾勝Ｖ隊之餘威，不僥不折，奮勇到底。電影明星，雖圖掙扎，無如替換乏人，勉力應戰，不得不以二十九對三十四敗下陣內，使仁餘隊再得升上一格。本週精彩之賽中北二遇勁旅</p>
<p>本週內秩序明　中北逢華南，可望有劇鬥。後者正向榮之時，老氣橫秋之中北，須謹慎從事。週五，中北更將遇雄心勃勃之汕隊，又是一塲格鬥。不職汪隊長戴指導，將以何連拔此二城。週三大華遇華南，亦必有劇烈搏鬥。故本週內申報盃籃球之表演，將更趨昇化，爲滬壇籃球界創一頁值得紀念之球史。記者執筆至此，遙望本週之比煤有水準之提高，引領以待，亦球迷之所冀望者。</p>
<h3>女排球健將黃杏芬婚禮花絮</h3>
<p>在女子排球壇上，享名十餘載盛名，迄未稍衰者，恐祗此一人黃杏芬小姐而已。本屆綠隊之獲得排球錦標，與有大功。黃小姐於昨日下午三時，在國際禮拜堂與楊逸澄君結婚，記者有請柬，乃欣然往賀。茲略記花絮：　　到男女來賓百餘人，體育界到者除綠隊全體外，（少張敏知一人）有俞斌祺李震中夫婦程洪生及唐祖藝等，紅男綠女，喜氣盈盈，熱鬧一時。蔚雯無意逗引新娘難忍而笑</p>
<p>在鋼琴走曲聲中，新郎先由牧師陪立，新娘由乃叔陪同在進行曲中，按着韻調，緩步而來。一位是年老的長者，一位勢球塲上稱雄的健將。一旦要這樣文　　，走一步停二步，於是在眾目集中下，大家多笑了。在中途新娘的兜紗牽住了途傍的花草，嚴蔚雯小姐是好意，斜彎了腰，秋波是看備新娘，兩手幫助，將兜紗拉起，然而新娘還以爲逗引她，於是滿腹喜事的新娘笑了，全堂更哄然！康祖藝大忙尤鴻英默然</p>
<p>攝影記者康君昨亦大忙，拍了不少照片，最後到花園裏與服裝整齊之綠隊全體合影。唯劉珍寶嚴蔚雯二位嶄然衣服，儼然參加盛典，別有風韻。隊員分立左右，新娘獨居中央，大家滿臉笑容。唯尤鴻英小姐優點默然，蓋尤小姐與新娘朝夕相處，形影不離，此後當減少機會，能無動於中乎？一片謝別聲中新娘猶約練球</p>
<p>茶點旣畢，相互謝別聲中，新娘猶頻向綠隊全體，相約星期日練習，不可遲到。謝益欽語記者，此恐爲新娘搪塞之詞而已。新婚期中，難望杏芬再來練習矣。</p>

<h3>Weekly Commentary: From the Balkans to the Far East</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jisheng</p>
<p>Q: Since Romania and Bulgaria successively made peace with the Soviet Union, and British troops have landed in Greece, the friction between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers has become increasingly profound. How will the future international relations between the Anglo-American-Soviet trio develop?</p>
<p>A: There are fundamental contradictions between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union. The current friction in the Balkan Peninsula is merely a manifestation of these basic contradictions. Even in terms of war aims, the operational objectives of the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union are fundamentally different. The Anglo-German war came before, and the Soviet war came after; this is a difference in timing. Before the Anglo-German war broke out, the Soviet Union had already concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany. After the Anglo-German war broke out, the Soviet Union concluded economic and other treaties with Germany. This proves that the Soviet Union had no intention of joining forces with the Anglo-American powers at the beginning of the war. When the German-Soviet war broke out, the Anglo-American powers applauded from the sidelines, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would destroy each other. This is a clear indication that the Anglo-American powers did not want the Soviet Union to rise in Europe, and it further proves the fundamental contradictions in policies and psychology between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union. Given that contradictions are exposed in all aspects, the Anglo-American-Soviet [United Front] is naturally an accidental combination. The result of an accidental combination can, of course, be separated at any time. The more the war progresses, the more obvious the contradictions between the two sides become, and the greater the possibility of separation. Therefore, the conflicting interests of the Anglo-American-Soviet powers in the Balkan Peninsula are merely the beginning of a future split between the three countries. I believe that it is absolutely impossible to resolve the fundamental contradictions between the Anglo-American powers and the Soviet Union in Europe.</p>
<p>Q: However, judging from the recent Anglo-American policy towards the Soviet Union, isn't it making concessions to the Soviet Union as much as possible, whether in politics or economics?</p>
<p>A: Indeed, the Anglo-American powers are currently at war with Germany, and they have to express goodwill towards the Soviet Union in all aspects. Therefore, in order to avoid temporary friction, they must make concessions to the Soviet Union. The Polish issue is the best example. However, these concessions from the Anglo-American powers are by no means unlimited. The reason why they continue to make concessions to the Soviet Union is because they have not reached the highest saturation point. The Anglo-American powers still want to use the strength of the Soviet Union to fight Germany, and at the same time, they want to use the strength of the Soviet Union to deplete its own vitality. This is the Anglo-American conspiracy in Europe. However, the reality is not as simple as the Anglo-American powers imagine. The Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Europe is expanding day by day, and at the same time, its friction with the Anglo-American powers is increasing day by day. We can prove this by looking at the Balkans alone. The Soviet Union's attempt to delineate the Balkan Peninsula as its sphere of influence did not begin today. The Soviet Union's greatest hope in the past few decades has been to find a way out to the sea. The Soviet Union does not have many outlets to the sea in Europe, only the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. The Arctic Ocean is frozen all year round, the Baltic Sea has a poor climate, and the Black Sea must pass through the Turkish Straits. None of these three outlets are ideal. Therefore, the biggest reason why the Soviet Union coveted the Balkans is precisely this. During the tense situation on the Eastern Front, it did not hesitate to send heavy troops to attack Romania. As a result, Romania surrendered, and Bulgaria soon made peace with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's long-standing desires have also been partially fulfilled. However, the problem lies here. Once the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, it will cause a great conflict with the Anglo-American powers, especially Britain. The Mediterranean has always been regarded as a possession of Britain, the countries of the Near East are Britain's treasure trove of resources, and Turkey is regarded by Britain as a barrier to the Near East. However, once the Soviet Union enters the Mediterranean through the Balkans, it will be seen by Britain as a serious threat to the Mediterranean, Turkey, and the countries of the Near East. Moreover, this threat is a fatal threat to Britain and must be restricted. This is where the Anglo-Soviet rivalry begins. The recent landing of British troops in Greece is the beginning of the Anglo-Soviet rivalry. Therefore, I say that although the Anglo-American powers are still making concessions to the Soviet Union, the more the Anglo-American powers make concessions to the Soviet Union, the more it proves that the relationship between the Anglo-American-Soviet powers is deteriorating day by day.</p>
<p>Q: If the relationship between the Anglo-American-Soviet powers is like this in Europe, what about in the Far East?</p>
<p>A: The policies adopted by the Soviet Union in Europe cannot be implemented in the Far East without change. The center of gravity of Soviet national policy is in Europe, not in Asia. Europe is in a state of war, while Asia is the opposite. This should be noted. Therefore, although the Soviet Union is nominally on the same front as the Anglo-American powers in Europe, it cannot be that simple in the Far East. For example, although the Anglo-American powers have tried their best to get the Soviet Union to participate in their [Four Powers Conference], Stalin only participated in the Tehran Conference and never went to Cairo. We only saw the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers holding trilateral talks, but we never saw the [Four Powers Conference] realized. Although the United States has repeatedly asked the Soviet Union to provide air bases in the Far East, there has been no response in reality. All of this proves that the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in the Far East are running counter to those of the Anglo-American powers. The biggest reason is that the Soviet Union and Japan still maintain a treaty of neutrality.</p>
<p>Q: Although Japan maintains a neutral relationship with the Soviet Union, it is now at war with the Anglo-American powers, and the Anglo-American-Soviet trio are at war with Germany in Europe. At the same time, Germany is Japan's ally. In this complex and delicate international relationship, what is the diplomatic relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>A: I believe that Japan and the Soviet Union have not only concluded a treaty of neutrality, but also, in fact, the two sides will continue to maintain the treaty of neutrality. This is not a relationship of the treaty itself, but because the interests of Japan and the Soviet Union are completely consistent. The Soviet Union is at war in Europe, so not only does it not need to look to the east, but it also has no time to look to the east. Japan is also at war with the Anglo-American powers in Asia, and the area of ​​operation is in the South Seas, so it needs the security of the northern border even more. For this reason, since the interests of Japan and the Soviet Union are completely consistent, it is extremely reasonable to continue to maintain the treaty of neutrality. With the Soviet Union's established policy, no matter how the Anglo-American powers ask the Soviet Union to provide air bases, ask the Soviet Union to participate in the [Four Powers Conference], or even threaten the Soviet Union with [stopping the supply of weapons], the Soviet Union still maintains the current treaty of neutrality without being moved by it. This is not only because there are fundamental contradictions between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-American powers; in fact, Stalin deeply feels that if the Soviet Union imitates the actions of the Anglo-American powers in the Far East, this will not only not benefit the Soviet Union, but will also suffer serious consequences.</p>

<h3>Acting Chairman Chen's Speech Encourages Filipinos to Rise Up; Our Country Resolves to Provide Support</h3>
<p>○Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) After learning that the enemy American forces had landed on Leyte Island in the Philippines, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government issued a speech to encourage the Filipinos to rise up, and stated that our country is determined to actively support them with all its strength. The original text of the speech is recorded as follows: It is heard that enemy forces landed on Leyte Island, near Tacloban in the Philippines, on the 20th. We firmly believe that this move is a risky operation by the enemy, and the Japanese allied forces and the people of the Philippines in that area will intercept and annihilate them. The enemy has entered the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, further arousing the common anger of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, and further arousing the hatred of the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere that were once colonies of the enemy. Today, it will not be difficult for the nations of Greater East Asia to wipe them out. In short, although the enemy has achieved a landing attempt in one or two places, it has no impact on the overall war situation. On the contrary, it will be more beneficial to the war efforts of the people of Greater East Asia. Today, we place unlimited expectations on our Filipino compatriots, and at the same time, we are prepared to provide active and effective support.</p>

<p>○Yangon, 21st (Central News Agency telegram) General Kimura, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Burma: issued a statement on the 21st as follows: I am sincerely pleased to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Looking back on the past year, Bose has steadfastly consolidated the position of the government internally, and at the same time, united 3 million Indian people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere outside his motherland, leading the Indian National Army to cooperate with the Japanese army in combat. In the Burmese border area, they shattered the British army's military prestige. Now, the British and American forces are attempting to decide the war in a short period of time, and although they have launched reckless battles everywhere, they have ultimately been plagued by our army's clever bleeding operations. The Free Indian government's desire to make the motherland independent as soon as possible is certainly not easy, but under the efforts of Chairman Bose, it is believed that all difficulties can be overcome and its long-cherished wish can be achieved. We, the Japanese army dispatched to Burma, will continue to fully support it as before. On this memorable day, I wish the Indian people and the Indian army increasingly prosperous, and once again express the determination of the Japanese and Indian armies to jointly destroy the enemy.</p>

<h3>Price Stabilization Council Approves Price Control Plan, Authorities to Adopt Decisive Measures to Enforce Current Prices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Price Stabilization Council, to discuss effective measures for controlling and stabilizing prices, held its eleventh council meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month in the conference room of the Economic Bureau. The committee members in attendance included Director Xu Tianshen, Municipal Government Councilor Pan Da, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Yu Ying (represented by Zhang Yuqi), Director of the Goods Distribution Office Feng You (represented by Sun Guowu), Director of the Health Bureau Yuan Rongchang, Director of the Aquatic Products Management Bureau Liu Weijun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yuan Fudeng, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association Lin Kanghou, representative from the press Chen Binhe, Manager of the Central Reserve Bank Dai Ku, Chairman of the Commercial Control Association Wen Lanting (represented by Li Sheyu), Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Council Chen Guoquan (represented by Pan Mengqiao), Chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Council Sun Zhongli (represented by Shan Zhe), Chairman of the Oil and Grain Control Council Chen Ziyi, Chairman of the Daily Necessities Control Council Luo Nezhai, and over twenty others. First, Chairman Xu Tianshen reported on the recent price situation and emergency measures, then the discussion began: 1. Regarding fundamental solutions to stabilize prices: (A) Request the Central Government to dredge material sources; (B) Encourage increased production. Regarding temporary solutions, request the Economic Bureau to collaborate with the Economic Security Office to strictly crack down on hoarding, manipulation, and exceeding price limits. The resolution was passed. 2. Suggest the Municipal Government find ways to increase the distribution of rice, coal, and cooking oil. The resolution was passed. 3. Assess the prices of ninety-six categories of publicly designated commodities in the city. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry for record. Enforce Price Limits</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter learned from relevant authorities that the authorities are fully determined to stabilize prices and will adopt decisive measures to enforce price limits. The prices of all goods have been assessed by the Price Stabilization Council and submitted to the authorities for approval. All businesses must strictly comply and sell as much as possible. Price lists must be posted in prominent places so that citizens can compare prices when shopping. If any unscrupulous merchants dare to exceed price limits, refuse to sell goods, sell goods on the black market, or if outsiders hoard goods, once verified, they will be severely punished. Thorough Investigation of Rice Hoarding</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices in the city suddenly rose, then plummeted, clearly indicating manipulation by someone. Citizens are outraged. It is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau has received information that certain unscrupulous merchants are hoarding rice and deliberately raising rice prices, and other illegal activities. They are collaborating with the Economic Security Office for a secret investigation, strictly pursuing the matter. These degenerate elements will not escape the law, and rice prices in the city will likely fall further.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Director Xu Discusses the Relationship between Rice and Commodity Prices and the Recent Measures Decided by the Authorities</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities have been actively studying and seeking solutions to the rice and commodity price issues. Citizens are very concerned about this, and newspapers have raised several questions related to commercial control. It is reported that the Commercial Control Association will send representatives to the press conference to explain further. This Central News Agency reporter, believing that commodity prices and rice prices are closely related, also visited the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Mr. Xu Tianshen, and asked about the Municipal Government's recent measures on this issue. Mr. Xu responded to each item as follows: Political Power to Curb Rising Winds</p>
<p>1. Question: Director Xu's previous report on commodity prices provided a very accurate diagnosis of the ailment and a very good prescription. Does he have the necessary ingredients for an effective remedy? Answer: My previous report was in response to Mr. Chu's urgent questioning. I merely used my one year of experience to give a candid account. What people are unwilling to say, I also said. It was not fabricated out of thin air or alarmist talk to shirk responsibility. My intention is that this matter is of great importance. I want to promote the attention of all parties, to jointly study and research together, and not to conceal the illness for fear of treatment, allowing the condition to worsen to a critical state. Regarding my responsibilities, I will continue to work hard and actively proceed, determined to use political power to curb the rising winds. I will seek and proceed along any path that can be taken. I will make every effort to use what my authority can reach without leaving any room for error. I hope Mr. Chu will provide more guidance and assistance. Please Advise Me with Facts</p>
<p>2. Question: Could Director Xu elaborate on the effective emergency measures he mentioned? Answer: I am a practitioner, not a theorist. Since taking office a year ago, under the leadership of my wise superiors, I have been doing things practically and realistically, never giving many speeches. It is best to put words into action. I think it is best to act without speaking and be a man of deep silence and broad determination. Regarding this matter, regarding the whole, I have exhausted my experience and sincerely contributed. Regarding the partial, I will ask Mr. Chu for advice with facts when emergency measures are taken. People's Morality and Responsibility</p>
<p>3. Question: The unscrupulous merchants in this city are particularly clever, often exploiting loopholes in government regulations and weaknesses in society to deceive and evade. Director Xu's so-called effective measures should be very detailed; otherwise, they will have excuses to escape. Does Director Xu think so? Answer: Indeed, this city is the essence of the country, and the merchants are particularly clever. Many malpractices are caused by defects in the system and the weakness of social morality. But all the laws and regulations set by the government are a principle. Whether people can abide by them depends on the people's patriotism and sense of responsibility. Throughout my life, I have always opposed people's so-called cleverness and preferred to do practical things with a sincere heart. Every time I discuss the issue of commodity prices, in addition to pointing out the cause of the disease and implementing strong rectification, I also want to awaken people's morality and sense of responsibility. This point is also Mr. Chu's responsibility. Eliminate Rice Weevils and Stabilize Rice Prices</p>
<p>4. Question: Rice is expensive, and all commodities are very expensive. Does Director Xu have any solutions for the current extremely high black market price of rice? Answer: Rice and grain have rice and grain control agencies, which are not under my jurisdiction. I believe the rice and grain authorities must have good policies. Since Mr. Chu insists that I speak, I believe that the current rise in the black market price of rice is not due to a shortage of supply or its inherent cost. According to reports, the autumn harvest in various rice-producing areas is abundant, and the rice authorities are also working hard to improve harvesting and transportation methods. The focus of the high price is entirely due to intentional manipulation. I believe that the rise in all commodity prices is caused by the spread of the black market price of rice. The germs of this infectious disease are the rice weevils. The people of the whole country are hoping for stable rice prices and are working hard to stabilize rice prices, but the rice weevils are creating high rice prices to seek exorbitant profits. Since the news spread on the market that the government will improve rice harvesting and transportation methods and that the mayor has ordered the distribution authorities to distribute on schedule, the black market price of rice in the city first fell from 23,000-24,000 yuan to 18,000-19,000 yuan, and then fell from 18,000-19,000 yuan to 15,000-16,000 yuan. This further proves that the high price of rice is not inherent but man-made. Moreover, rice prices in various places rise and fall with the rise and fall of prices in this city. I believe that if all parties show conscience, make many efforts, and work together to stabilize prices, the black market price of rice in this city will definitely fall below 10,000 yuan, and prices in various places will be even lower. I believe that to stabilize commodity prices, we must first stabilize rice prices. I will make efforts to assist the rice authorities in stabilizing rice prices. I also have a word to say: Rice and grain are entrusted with military rations and people's lives. Now that the military is winning victories on the front lines, in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the responsibility of our national government personnel and resources should be more active. We should not condone the rice weevils' indulgence, nor should we act as rice weevils, causing difficulties for military needs and people's food. I believe that anyone who uses rice prices to get rich, or who only cares about the warmth and fullness of their own family, storing excessive amounts of rice, regardless of the hunger of the people and the military rations, is a rice weevil. A nation-state with such rice weevils who have lost their conscience is the worst species in the nation-state (not only lacking morality but also committing the greatest crime). A nation-state with this inferior species is not worthy of speaking of independence and autonomy, or of being qualified for alliance. Therefore, I advocate that to supply military rations, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To enable the people to eat cheap rice, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To restore the people's morality, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To demand independence and freedom, we must eliminate the rice weevils. To complete the Greater East Asia War, we must first eliminate the rice weevils. I believe that all government economic policies should begin with the elimination of the rice weevils. I am currently only stabilizing commodity prices. I consider the rice weevils our first evil enemy. To eliminate this infectious disease, we should carry out a comprehensive campaign to eliminate the rice weevils. I hope the whole country will rise up to extinguish the germs of this infectious disease (rice weevils), and then use political power to stabilize all commodity prices. We will definitely achieve results. I hope Mr. Chu will assist the government in writing a proclamation to punish the rice weevils like Chen Lin. The Issue of Increasing the Price of Rationed Rice</p>
<p>5. Question: It is said that the price of rationed rice will be increased. Has it been unified by the Materials Evaluation Council? If so, it is feared that rice prices will be difficult to... The prices of rationed goods are determined separately under the current commodity price management system without the consent of the Materials Evaluation Council. The price of rice is also the same. I have briefly mentioned it in my previous report. I believe that the price of a publicly designated commodity must take into account the general commodity price level and must be based on the cost accounting of the commodity. From my standpoint, I am unwilling to increase prices. Moreover, price increases will affect the cost relationship of all commodities and the wages of the working class. But this is a factual issue. The rice authorities must have considered it carefully, and there is no need to filter it further.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Will Be Sold Today at Two Sheng for 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Household Ration Office has been rushing to process the issuance of distribution trucks and outbound procedures in recent days. It has been determined that from the 22nd to the 31st, citizens in the old first district can purchase two shi sheng of Xian rice, glutinous rice, or brown rice at designated retail rice stores with the 23rd serial number, for a total price of 100 yuan in national currency. All distribution areas of the former Grain Bureau are currently adjusting the certificate issuance procedures and will not be distributed in time, so it will be postponed for a few days, and distribution will be announced separately. In addition, coal balls, soybeans, soap, and other items for rationed citizens in the area will also be issued separately in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Anti-American and British Fleet Rally to Pray for Victory Day 1 Continues This Afternoon at 5 PM</h3>

For an hour, the listening public listened intently and were inspired. After the speech, the new China Film film [Reunion] was shown. Today is the second day of the conference. It will still be held at Da Guangming at 5 PM, inviting naval representatives from China and Japan, Central Naval Academy Principal Jiang Xiyuan (Lieutenant General), and Fleet Reporting Department Supervisor Ota (Captain) to give speeches. Chairman Chen Xiaokun filed a complaint stating that on December 7, 1942, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requested the Municipal Government to cancel the commission of the association. On January 19, 1943, the Shanghai Social Movement Branch requested the Municipal Government to stop the association from forcibly collecting taxes. On January 21, the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting an investigation into the illegal levy of firewood taxes. On May 15 of this year, the fifth district of the Water Police Association and Zhang Wenxue, the chairman of the firewood industry association, jointly submitted a report to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan for investigation, which is currently being processed. The association believes that firewood and charcoal are necessities for the citizens of the city. Recently, due to the insufficient quality of coal balls, citizens mostly use firewood and charcoal as the basic fuel for cooking. Such illegal exploitation has a great impact on the lives of citizens. In addition to continuing to investigate the inside story of the association, it has also sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown to warn unscrupulous merchants and relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life in This City Will Commemorate Mitsuru Toyama the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Secretariat, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Propaganda Department, the East Asia League Shanghai Branch, and others have jointly initiated a memorial service on the morning of the 23rd of this month at 9:00 AM at the Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road to commemorate the merits of Japanese patriot Mitsuru Toyama and express condolences. Representatives from all walks of life will attend the ceremony, which will be solemn.</p>
<h3>Advisory Council Asks for Thorough Investigation into the Inside Story of the Firewood Price Hike, the Firewood and Charcoal Association Sets Up Card Checkpoints to Extort Fees</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Advisory Council is extremely anxious about the soaring prices of daily necessities for the citizens of the city and is conducting a separate study on ways to stabilize prices. Recently, the prices of firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and other fuels in the city have been rising sharply. The council, based on confidential reports from citizens, found that the collective distribution investment association of the firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and charcoal industry affiliated to the Central Market violated the regulations and set up card checkpoints in disguise to extort handling fees, which increased costs and affected sales prices. According to the investigation, the establishment guidelines of the collective distribution investment association of the Central Market stipulate that all goods entrusted to the market for sale should be purchased by the collective distribution investment association at the prices assessed by the market. All purchased goods should be subject to a fixed handling fee and distributed to the retail merchants designated by the market. The market stipulates that the handling fee for firewood and charcoal should be 2.5%. Recently, it was found that the firewood and charcoal association does not purchase according to the assessed prices. Instead, it has established offices around the urban area of the city. Whenever firewood and charcoal are transported to the urban area, it extorts handling fees and overcharges 3.5%, which has become a tax collection agency in disguise, with extremely high income, causing dissatisfaction among the industry. In the spring of 1942, the Miscellaneous Firewood Industry Association filed a complaint.</p>
<h3>Short Comment: Why are Fuel Prices Soaring?</h3>
<p>According to the news published today, the Municipal Government Advisory Council received a confidential report from a citizen stating that the collective distribution investment association of the firewood, miscellaneous firewood, and charcoal industry affiliated to the Central Market violated the regulations and set up card checkpoints in disguise to extort handling fees for firewood and charcoal entering the city. Therefore, the cost of firewood and charcoal has increased, and prices have soared. The citizens asked the advisory council to find a way. The council is investigating the inside story and has sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown. Fuel is one of the daily necessities of the people, as important as rice. Recently, the price of coal has soared due to a lack of supply and demand imbalance. However, the source of firewood is not as scarce as coal, but the price is soaring unexpectedly. We suspect that someone is manipulating and hoarding it. Unexpectedly, an affiliated institution of the Central Market dares to violate the regulations and openly extort fees, causing fuel prices to rise and affecting the lives of citizens, especially the general public. The prices of rice and fuel are the center of general commodity prices and play a leading role in the rise and fall of general commodity prices. At a time when commodity prices are soaring, the factors that stimulate and trigger the rise in commodity prices must not be allowed to exist. Especially for speculation and hoarding, illegal extortion, and other matters, the Municipal Government should quickly crack down and severely punish them in accordance with wartime economic disruption crimes, in order to warn others and stabilize commodity prices.</p>

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Divides the City into Air Defense Zones, Using Police Precinct Areas as Units</h3>
<p>In order to divide the city into air defense zones and seek closer contact with citizens to strengthen the air defense posture, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in accordance with the opinions of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command, conducted research and organized an ideal air defense system. After continuous and detailed review, it was decided to use the areas under the jurisdiction of the police precincts as the unit for local air defense affairs operations, directly under the Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters. The organization of the air defense zone and the policy for dividing the air defense zone are recorded as follows: 1. Under each police precinct, establish a council with the total Lianbao or Lianbao area as a unit, and divide the air defense zone. Residents in the area, including Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners, should unite and cultivate strength to protect their own lives and property. 2. Set up air defense control zones in each area under the jurisdiction of the police precincts. The lower-level organizations and groups related to air defense in the area should jointly organize the air defense control zone staff council, and attach an air defense control zone staff council when necessary. 3. The unit of the air defense zone shall be based on the area of the Baojia Lianbao (one air defense control zone staff council will have several Lianbao). This staff council shall be jointly organized by the Municipal Baojia Lianbao, Naval Baojia District Branch, Japanese Baojia, and Foreign Baojia. Each group shall elect one to several staff members. Also, depending on the size of the area, establish one air defense sub-district per Bao. Sub-districts will be established below it. If there are any conflicts between the Japanese neighborhood association, the Naval Baojia District, and the Municipal Baojia District when dividing the areas as above, suitable adjustments should be made first. 4. The offices of the Air Defense Control Zone Staff Council shall be jointly organized by the Japanese Residents' Association, the Naval Baojia, and the Municipal Baojia, who shall dispatch the same number of staff, and the staff of the police precinct. The chief of the police precinct shall also serve as the head of the office. 5. Under the air defense zone, roads and rivers should be considered to delineate the most suitable streets for the air defense terrain. Within this area, the above-mentioned groups shall establish air defense sub-districts. 6. The air defense group is the basic unit of air defense activities. The basic members are approximately 120, divided into six classes. The tasks they undertake are: (A) General Affairs Class (approximately 40 members), responsible for general affairs, relief to victims, management of liaison reservists; (B) Monitoring Class (approximately 20 members), responsible for air monitoring, monitoring of lighting control; (C) Fire Prevention Class (approximately 50 members), responsible for fire fighting; (D) Security Traffic Class (approximately 10 members), responsible for security and traffic control; (E) Rescue Class (approximately 20 members), responsible for rescue, poison prevention, guidance to shelters; (F) Work Class (approximately 10 members), responsible for other work. 7. The originally established special protection groups (air defense groups) shall still be retained. The main ones shall be ordered to participate in the air defense zone staff council in the area and incorporated into the district or group according to their organization size. 8. Air defense groups selected by various regions to organize outstanding air defense groups, such as model air defense groups, may be changed to ○○ Branch ○○ Special Air Defense Group, if facts make it possible, to develop their excellence.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Navy's Unshakable Confidence and Preparations to Obliterate the Enemy, With Minister Matsushima's Address at the Pre-Victory Celebration</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Naval Press Department, at yesterday's [Pre-Victory Celebration for Sweeping Away the American and British Fleets], delivered the following address: "I am truly delighted to be able to participate in this grand event hosted by the United Press Association and have the opportunity to express my thoughts. In the recent major naval and air battles off Taiwan and the Philippines, we achieved great victories, annihilating the enemy's Third Fleet's mobile force, a cause for immense celebration for the future of the war. The majority of the Third Fleet has been obliterated.</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Imperial General Headquarters, we have sunk or heavily damaged two aircraft carriers, one cruiser or destroyer, and damaged eight aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, one cruiser or destroyer, and one ship of unknown type. In addition, no fewer than twelve vessels are on fire. We have shot down over 112 enemy aircraft at sea, totaling over 57 enemy ships. Due to the sinking of aircraft carriers, the enemy has likely lost no fewer than 1,000 aircraft, and over 30,000 elite American troops have been sent to a watery grave. The Halsey Third Fleet that attacked Taiwan and the Philippines has been largely annihilated. The severity of such significant losses to the enemy can be seen from their chaotic propaganda and their silence regarding their losses. When Roosevelt met with reporters on the 16th, he presented various materials and models to explain the landing operations in Northern France, strenuously avoiding answering questions raised by reporters. Furthermore, on the 7th, Nimitz Headquarters announced that despite the constant attacks by Japanese aircraft day and night in Taiwan, our warships and aircraft carriers did not suffer significant damage. Also, according to a broadcast from New Delhi on the same day, it was propagated that American ships suffered no damage whatsoever. This is reminiscent of the silence adopted by the US naval command after the naval battles of Hawaii and Bougainville, which is truly chilling. However, our Imperial General Headquarters not only announces our victories but also openly publishes the losses we have sustained. For example, the entire Japanese forces on Omiya Island, Tinian Island, and Gilbert Islands were killed in action, and this fact was announced. The American public is gradually placing more trust in the battle situation announced by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, which is being relayed to various locations through Japanese broadcasts. From this, it can be seen that there are many contradictions in American propaganda. The enemy has suffered serious impacts.</p>
<p>The enemy's operations this time can be said to have entered the final decisive phase in the Pacific. Their main focus of attack is, of course, the central breakthrough line directly connecting the Philippines to the Chinese mainland. The enemy's previous attempts in Palau and Morotai can be seen as a prelude. However, the enemy has not yet reached Palau Island itself, having suffered heavy losses on small islands such as Peleliu on its periphery, losing ten ships and over 20,000 land troops. Roosevelt, anxious about the progress of the war, wanting to prevent Chongqing from wavering, and also due to the political issues surrounding the presidential election on November 7th, had no choice but to adopt a policy of rapid breakthrough in the Pacific. The enemy planned to have the Halsey Third Fleet attack Okinawa and Taiwan with great force, attempting to cut off the supply route between the Japanese mainland and Taiwan, and to lure out the Japanese Combined Fleet for a decisive battle. Once the results of the battle expanded, they would then have the Fifth Fleet directly attack the Philippines, crush Japanese land bases, and dispatch transport squadrons to easily capture the Philippines. The right wing, to the east of Taiwan, has already been attacked. That right wing can certainly be said to be the enemy's main force in the Pacific, representing the world's fleet. They were confident that they could defeat the Japanese Combined Fleet. Now that the enemy has lost this elite force, it can be imagined that it will have a serious impact on future operations. The Japanese Navy has unwavering confidence.</p>
<p>Currently, the enemy is desperately attempting to suddenly attack a corner of the Philippines with their left wing. However, their left wing is weaker than it was when dealing with Saipan. A sudden intrusion into the complex terrain of the Philippines, throwing themselves into the net of the elite Japanese land and sea garrison forces, is truly an excellent opportunity for us to annihilate the enemy. This time, the battle to the east of Taiwan has instantly transformed into an annihilation battle in the Philippines. Our Japanese Navy, with unwavering confidence and a resolute attitude to destroy the enemy, is prepared to intercept and strike. At the same time, the battle on the Chinese mainland is also victorious. In the future, the war situation will certainly lead to the destruction of the enemy. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the unwavering cooperation of the Chinese government and people, especially their efforts to facilitate the flow of resources, increase production, and improve transportation, even enduring inconveniences in daily life such as electricity, heating fuel, and transportation, and contributing everything to the war effort. This victory is, of course, the result of the combined efforts of China and Japan. The enemy, Britain and America, will do everything possible to reverse their decline. Therefore, regarding the future destiny of China and Japan, I earnestly hope for your enthusiastic cooperation. The great victories of the Imperial Navy will prevent the American forces from landing on the Chinese mainland, allowing you to escape the fires of war, restore China to its original state, and the Japanese also hope that Chongqing will take the same view, change its policies, and achieve comprehensive peace, laying the foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia."</p>
<h3>Firmly Believing in Inevitable Victory, Welcoming the Great Victory in Taiwan: An Address by Chen Binhe</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima has just explained the details of the naval battle of Taiwan very clearly. We should have a deep understanding of the relationship between this victory in the Taiwan sea and the Greater East Asia War. It is true that the enemy America's offensive in the Pacific has gradually become more intense in the past two months. Those without knowledge believe that the serious situation of the war is not as great as generally imagined. In a long-term war, the gains and losses of a local battle cannot affect the overall situation. In the Pacific war, because the battlefield is a vast ocean, the determination of victory or defeat cannot be shifted by the gains and losses of a certain island. Now that the enemy America is moving deeper westward, they are farther away from their homeland, their supply lines are longer, and their supplies are more difficult. On the contrary, Japan not only maintains the superior situation since the start of the war, but also the war guidance authorities' forbearance and self-respect, determined to wait quietly for the opportunity, and then launch a fierce attack on the enemy forces with elite forces who have not yet been dispatched when the enemy forces repeatedly penetrate into the absolute power circle. Most authoritative military experts have made such observations in the past, and this great victory in the Taiwan sea further proves the correctness of this observation. We observe that the purpose of the enemy America's large-scale air raid on Taiwan this time is nothing more than four points: First, Roosevelt attempted to take risks in the Pacific war and win by luck as a means of running for a fourth term as president. Second, to explore the near road to landing on the Chinese mainland in order to save the defeat of the US-Yu army on the Chinese mainland. Third, to detect the truth and falsehood of the Japanese army's homeland defense line, and to attempt to destroy Taiwan's aviation base facilities. Fourth, the most important thing in the enemy America's naval strategy is to lure the Japanese naval main force into a decisive battle. Now that the Japanese army has won an unprecedented victory, it is obvious that the enemy America's purpose cannot be realized. At the same time, this time the Japanese army has secured great combat power in Taiwan, then the Chinese mainland can be defended in the future. Therefore, from the position of the Chinese people, we should pay more attention to it. Furthermore, Prime Minister Koiso said in his speech at the Tokyo National Assembly on the 20th: [Although the Japanese army is still fighting in China, the war is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army, and even does not rely on British and American forces. Even the Chongqing army is not regarded as an enemy. The Yu side not only failed to recognize the real enemy of China itself, but was driven by the real enemy and launched a useless war of resistance against Japan, which made the real enemy more and more rampant. Regarding this point, I deeply regret it. The Japanese authorities have clearly distinguished the targets of the war. In order to step up cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, we should do two things. First, firmly believe in victory and not be shaken by any rumors. Our grasp of victory is by no means accidental. Recently, Soviet military expert Xiang Ermarsiv discussed the difficulty of the US attacking the Philippines and said it very objectively, that is, US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz also admitted at a current affairs discussion conference hosted by the American Weekly on October 16 that the path to victory in the war against Japan is still far away and there are still many difficulties. Second, we must never do anything that is detrimental to the Greater East Asia War, and we must strive to do anything that is beneficial to the Greater East Asia War, and work together to strive for the overall victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>The Provisional Government Persists in its Policy, and the Day of Fulfilling its Long-Cherished Wish Will Eventually Come: An Address by Chief Kawamoto at the Anniversary of the Indian Government</h3>
<p>Major General Kawamoto, the Chief of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, stated at the anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Provisional Government of India: "It has been a year since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India in Syonan. Today, I am pleased to celebrate its first anniversary, and I would like to extend my best wishes. Looking back on the past year since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the war has entered a decisive stage, and the world of East Asia is also in a time of turmoil. Under the leadership of Leader Bose, various difficulties have been overcome and healthy development has been achieved, which is a cause for celebration not only for the 400 million Indian people but also for the various ethnic groups in East Asia. The status of the Provisional Government of Free India is becoming increasingly strengthened, and it is fighting for the liberation of its homeland. This is all due to the effective guidance of leaders such as Jiang Tela Bose, the patriotic enthusiasm of Indians in various parts of East Asia, and the assistance of various allied nations. However, what should be further emphasized is that the Provisional Government of Free India is determined to use force to resist Britain, because the British Empire wants to use India as its heart, exploiting it at will. Therefore, if we want to drive out Britain, we must rely on force. The main reason for past failures was the underestimation of force. Now, the Provisional Government of Free India has adopted force and changed its previous policy. The achievements of the Indian National Army in assisting the Japanese army in the Battle of Imphal this year, as well as the damage inflicted on the enemy, prove that the Provisional Government's policy is absolutely correct. Although the distance to [Advance on Delhi] is still far, I firmly believe that the Provisional Government will persevere. Britain, seeing the vigorous atmosphere of the new India, stimulated the hearts of the people in India, so it released Gandhi and others to appease the people. However, Britain's ambition to dominate India is even more obvious. At a time when Britain's power in India is declining, the United States has risen to replace Britain and is eagerly seeking to dominate the world and seize control of India's political and economic power. We believe that the United States harbors the same ambitions as Britain and should crush it with the forces of justice. Since the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, the Japanese government has spared no effort to provide comprehensive cooperation and support. Today, as the Provisional Government of Free India enters its second year, I express my congratulations on its past glory and future prospects, and hope to work together to obliterate Britain and America and complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<h3>Bachelor of Economics</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lin</p>
<p>The autumn before last, while attending my cousin's wedding, my uncle introduced me to a distant relative whose background I didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>"In terms of relationship, Yingjie is your cousin."</p>
<p>Before my uncle could finish speaking, my cousin's face was already full of smiles, and he immediately handed me a finely printed business card.</p>
<p>Bachelor of Economics, XX University Pan Yingjie</p>
<p>"I don't have a business card, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, we're all family."</p>
<p>A few days later, my cousin came to visit, saying, "Since we're relatives, we shouldn't be too distant."</p>
<p>In reality, his true purpose was to say to my father, "Uncle, you're a senior in the financial world, I hope you can provide me with an opportunity."</p>
<p>My father asked him, "Where have you worked before?"</p>
<p>"Not yet! But at school, I did government bonds and stocks with my classmates."</p>
<p>My father asked him, slightly displeased, "What year did you graduate?"</p>
<p>"I just graduated this year," but he hesitated slightly, "but I'm still missing a thesis."</p>
<p>"Then is your thesis ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've already started working on it!"</p>
<p>"What's the topic?"</p>
<p>"Introduction to Economics."</p>
<p>"How do you discuss economics?"</p>
<p>"Economics..." He turned his head to think for a moment, "The scope of economics is too broad. The government has government economics, schools have school economics, shops have shop economics, war has war economics... In general, it's all about managing money."</p>
<p>My cautious father smiled for once. The Bachelor of Economics seemed to realize that his fabricated theory had a flaw, so he quickly followed up with a statement, "The thesis is actually being drafted by a friend. I've been busy looking for a job during the summer vacation and haven't had a stable time to work on the thesis."</p>
<p>My father stood up a little impatiently and said to him, "I have to go to the bank to work. I'll let you know if there's an opportunity." He turned back and told me, "Have a good talk with your cousin."</p>
<p>That winter, my father took over the management of a corporate company affiliated with the bank. My cousin came to visit again. The business card that read "Bachelor of Economics, XX University" seemed even bigger, perhaps because the thesis had already been submitted!</p>
<p>My father was eating. He looked at the business card, shook his head, and said, "Lin'er, go tell him I'm not home."</p>
<p>"Second cousin, how are you! Is Uncle home?" He greeted me first.</p>
<p>Of course, I replied that he wasn't home, so he took out a letter and asked me to hand it over to my father before hurriedly leaving.</p>
<p>The letter was from my uncle, hoping that my father could arrange a suitable position for Yingjie in the corporate company.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of my uncle's relationship, my father thought for a while and said to me, "Call your uncle and tell him that if Yingjie is willing to work in the real estate department, he can come to the bank to see me tomorrow."</p>
<p>Yingjie joined the company during a time when stocks were plummeting and real estate was booming. Therefore, my cousin, the Bachelor of Economics, was able to display his skills. Within a short period of time, he gained the trust of the director and handled relatively important matters in real estate transactions. However, in less than a few months, rumors secretly spread within the company that he was "wearing a hat" in the company's transactions, skimming off the top, and making several substantial side profits.</p>
<p>Next, he misappropriated the company's public funds to invest in stocks. The Bachelor of Economics' view was that since real estate was so active, stocks could not remain stagnant forever. Therefore, he heavily supplemented his positions. However, the reality was quite the opposite. A low tide followed by a lower tide forced him to cling to those worthless pieces of paper and wait bitterly. But the company couldn't wait for him. Under the director's accidental discovery, his fate was declared to its first end.</p>
<p>Last summer vacation, I went to Jiaxing to visit my sister who was recovering from illness in the countryside. While buying a ticket at the train station, I was anxious because I couldn't squeeze onto the platform. Suddenly, someone in the crowd called out to me. I turned around and saw that it was my cousin, the Bachelor of Economics.</p>
<p>After he learned of my difficulty, he easily led me into the carriage through another entrance and secured a good window seat for me in his second-class carriage.</p>
<p>He then told me that he was contacting a force to smuggle Western medicine and dyes to XX. He could make a net profit of forty to fifty thousand yuan per trip once a month. He said, "If I can't make money, why would I study economics at school? Why would I even be a Bachelor of Economics?"</p>
<p>Regarding the "misappropriation of public funds" incident, he also used the same argument to justify himself. He said with great emotion, "I'm a dignified Bachelor of Economics, can I only be a small clerk in an office, copying endless ledgers every day while being subservient? Since I studied economics, I can't help but turn my mind to economics and find a way out!"</p>
<p>It seemed that at that time, his economic prospects were quite good. From his attire, demeanor, and hands, one could sense a kind of bursting energy. Moreover, even that time when he returned from XX, he specifically sent us two high-quality Jinhua hams.</p>
<p>Soon, fate declared the second end for the Bachelor of Economics.</p>
<p>Yingjie's large batch of Western medicine was seized by customs in XX, and over one million yuan worth of goods were confiscated. XX also sent people to look for him because he had committed the crime of smuggling.</p>
<p>When my uncle sent the news, he sighed and said, "He was too greedy. Having five or six hundred thousand yuan would have been enough, why did he have to be so greedy?"</p>
<p>However, my cousin did not forget that he was a student of economics because of this. Relying on his connections, he quickly landed a lucrative position in the XX Bureau, traveling busily on the Beijing-Shanghai route for a while.</p>
<p>It is said that he earned such a huge sum of four or five million yuan in half a year, topped off a spacious Western-style house near XX Park, became infatuated with a cafe singer, and got married in a luxurious wedding.</p>
<p>These were all the things I heard when I went to congratulate him on my father's orders. I was about to tell my cousin, "Economics didn't let you down after all." But that day was crowded with guests, and in fact, he didn't say more than two or three sentences to me.</p>
<p>Less than a month after he said that, the XX embezzlement scandal that shocked the country broke out. Within a few days, the Bachelor of Economics had to leave his golden house and lovely wife to experience the taste of iron bars.</p>
<p>Next came the news that his lovely wife had run away, the golden house had been sealed up, and his deposits had been frozen.</p>
<p>Finally came the verdict of "ten years imprisonment for colluding in embezzlement."</p>
<p>This was the third declaration of the end of fate for the Bachelor of Economics.</p>
<p>In the dark prison, the Bachelor of Economics is now spending his long years. Today, he may regret it.</p>
<h3>Review of the Inaugural Issue of ［Biao］ (Gale)</h3>
<p>— Hai Que</p>
<p>○ The new-style comprehensive publication [Biao] is a magazine that has recently been launched and has made a good impression. The form design of the cover first gives people an extraordinary feeling, and the single-word title also explains that the organizers and editors are not bound by conventions but are full of innovative courage and strength. The dedication [Hope] is a crystallization of the joint effort, and the picture contains incomparable youthful fortitude and strength, bringing people confidence and hope. [End of the Road] is written by Tang Minzhi, whose works have been published in many other places and have been very successful. In this article, however, he has achieved even higher expression. Tang Xuan's anguished dialogues, writing about the changes in emotions that are both complex and tortuous, can be said to be meticulous. We have already read quite a few of Yuan Ying's works in this journal, and this time, the article brings us a fresh atmosphere. ○ Generally speaking, [Biao] is a magazine that is quite worth reading. The careful selection of editors is as mentioned above, and the design of the layout is also painstakingly done and varied, but there is very little vulgarity. The clarity of the printing and the sparseness of the lines also give readers a relaxed pleasure. These are all worth recommending to readers.</p>
<h3>A Chapter of Morning Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ni</p>
<p>○... The morning walk is relaxing. I stroll slowly along the quiet asphalt road. There is no hustle and bustle in the quiet surroundings. In this precious tranquility that is rare in this big city, I can raise my head and gaze at a piece of blue sky, I can step on the silent sand on the ground, I can pick up a stone and throw it hard.... In this situation, I can move freely. Yes, I truly enjoyed this lovely morning. I looked at the closed windows on both sides and the [overnight people] who were exhausted from a crazy night. I couldn't help but cast a contemptuous look at them.... And I took a deep breath, and a victorious, proud inner smile welled up. ○... I love the morning, and I also love the night. I feel that all the arrangements that nature has given to mankind are lovely, as long as you can appropriately and artistically grasp and use them. For example, night, indeed many people dislike its darkness and lifelessness, but the loveliness of the night lies in its tranquility. After a whole day of busyness and fatigue, the body can rest quietly at this time, and the tense and dizzy mind gradually calms down. You can leisurely fall into deep thought, think about yourself and think about others, think about the past, present or future.... Unleash your thoughts without restraint and take them to a vast place. Then you can put aside all the miscellaneous thoughts and comfortably enjoy a sweet and happy dream. The next day, you will be energetic and participate in the active team again. I have experienced the pain of insomnia, so I love the night even more, and I try my best to spend it rhythmically. Every moment in life should have a noble purpose (Gorky's words), how can we let go of this night that occupies half of our lives? Therefore, for those who are promiscuous, shameless and crazy at night, I feel a strong hatred, and I am particularly protective of myself. I am confident that in this journey of life, I will always grasp and guide myself, so as not to make a wrong step and regret it for the rest of my life.... ○... I unintentionally walked into the house again. Suddenly, a burst of urgent ringing approached me. The newspaper delivery man turned around and handed the newspaper to me, and drove away with a smile on his face. ○... This is a newspaper of the day. The clear lead characters inform the news and other information. Ah, what a heavy newspaper! I did not pick it up to read it. Immediately, many activities appeared in front of me in order to complete a newspaper in the newspaper office. Off-site reporters are busy going back and forth to interview news, and the on-site staff are rushing to write under the dim yellow light, squeezing their brains. The typesetters are rubbing their sleepy eyes and picking out the lead characters. The proofreaders are opening their eyes wide against the ant-like small characters to find errors, once, twice.... The clock is ticking and urging, and finally the machine is rumbling and printing out copies of the newspaper. Now this newspaper is in my hands, but it has exhausted how many people's efforts and labor. On every lovely night, there are so many people sacrificing themselves to serve mankind.... ○... I have always been confident that I will live my life well, at least I will not let down others and myself, but in contrast, I am so selfish and insignificant. I thought I was great, but I was just simply developing myself. I can sing praises and enjoy the night, and I can hate those who are licentious and waste the night, but I never thought of sacrificing the enjoyment of the night to serve the people. I feel deeply ashamed!</p>

<h3>Sports Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Commentary on Last Week's Group A Matches</h3>
<p>Last week's Shen Bao Cup basketball games, especially the Group A matches, were extremely exciting. The enthusiastic crowds at each game deeply moved the organizers. The following is a commentary on the Group A matches of the past week. Zhongbei and Renyu Triumph, Beiti V Team Defeated</p>
<p>In the two matches on Monday, Zhongbei faced Tongren. The former, firstly, had players with issues, and secondly, assumed a guaranteed victory, thus only sending five players. The Xuan family team, in addition to the original full squad, also had the support of Lu Dazhen. Thus, in terms of morale, there was a clear difference. The Xuan family team remained composed in the face of a strong enemy, displaying the "dark horse" spirit. Zhongbei, feeling insecure, was almost outsmarted. Fortunately, luck was on their side, and they narrowly defeated Tongren 46 to 40. In the next match, Renyu faced the V team. The former suffered a great loss of strength due to the departure of Ma Lin. The V team, newly emerging, had comparable strength, making the performance tense. Renyu ultimately relied on experience to win, with a score of 28 to 21. Hualian Demonstrates Power, Star Shines Radiantly</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, with championship hopes, welcomed the Huaying team. Most of the players were at work during the day. In this battle, Tan Yongzhan, Bao Songyuan, Wang Xuewu, and others were absent, leaving the team in a fragmented and demoralized state. Conversely, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, under the intensive training of Zhang Weixiang, made significant progress in all aspects. Their study of tactics was particularly successful. Because of this, Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory demonstrated power in this battle. Although the Huaying team had good spirit, their strength was inferior, leaving them helpless. The result was that Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory overwhelmingly defeated Huaying 61 to 9, which was also one of the most crushing defeats in Huaying's history, demonstrating Hualian's strength. In another match, the Star team faced the Tongren Association. The latter, under the guidance of Yuan Can, Xuan Ai, and Hou Ershi, was impeccable. The Star team, under the leadership of Zhou Wenji, showed great enthusiasm. The two teams clashed fiercely. The Xuan family team relied on the smooth shooting of Xuan Tong, and the score steadily rose. However, near the end of the first half, the star player Lu Dazhen was ejected for his fourth foul, leading to an irreversible situation. The Star team seized the opportunity to rise, shining brightly. Shen Da and Shi Jiuquan were magnificent, coming from behind to defeat the Xuan family team 69 to 59, which can be called a successful feat. No wonder Zhou Wenji's smile blossomed. Shantou Team Defeats Dahua, Renyu Continues Efforts</p>
<p>On Friday night, the battle between the Shantou team and Dahua was, to put it seriously, related to the championship. At the very least, the fight for third place was beyond doubt. Moreover, the cheering crowds for both teams were particularly large. Therefore, the scene in the basketball hall that night was the most grand in the Shen Bao Cup. Regarding the tactics of the two teams, Dahua's style was derived from the Paramount, adopting a man-to-man strategy. If they had sufficient stamina, with the qualifications of their players, it would be highly possible for them to triumph in the Shen Bao Cup and dominate the basketball scene. It was a pity that Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, Chen Xianglong, and others were all unable to perform to their full potential. The Shantou team was a rising star, whose strengths were the opposite of Dahua's. Their basketball skills were not yet perfect, but their strength and youth made them formidable. In this match, in the first half, Dahua relied on their remaining strength, and their man-to-man defense was sufficient. The Shantou team's intelligence was insufficient. Thus, Dahua won 13 to 7, which was not beyond expectations, and they even felt that the winning margin was not enough. Because of the stamina factor in the second half, the reporter had long predicted that the Shantou team would make a comeback. Indeed, after the start of the second half, Dahua gradually showed that their stamina was insufficient. The young players of the Shantou team became braver and braver. Dahua's strength failed them, and they made a tactical error in substituting players frequently, especially replacing Zhang Banglun with Xu Wenkui, which was the most unwise move. Because A-Kui's current state was not good, it was difficult to succeed by using him in a man-to-man basketball game. Thus, the Shantou team gradually entered the winning streak. Chen Qingjiang and Zhou Bin took advantage of A-Kui's frequent loopholes to score repeatedly, and they overcame Dahua 37 to 24. Dahua's defeat was due to a lack of stamina, not a lack of intelligence. Wisdom, Renyu and Huaying Meet, the latter still suffers from incomplete team. The former, riding the momentum of their victory over the V team, advanced bravely without complacency. Although the movie stars tried to struggle, they had no substitutes, forcing them to fight hard. They had no choice but to lose 29 to 34, allowing the Renyu team to rise another rank. This Week's Exciting Matches Zhongbei Faces Strong Opponents Twice</p>
<p>The schedule for this week is clear. Zhongbei faces Huanan, which is expected to be a dramatic battle. The latter is on the rise, and the experienced Zhongbei must proceed with caution. On Friday, Zhongbei will face the ambitious Shantou team, which will be another fierce battle. I wonder how Captain Wang and Director Dai will conquer these two cities. On Wednesday, Dahua will meet Huanan, which will also be a fierce battle. Therefore, the Shen Bao Cup basketball performances this week will be further elevated, creating a memorable chapter in the history of Shanghai basketball. The reporter, writing to this point, looks forward to the improvement in the level of matches this week, which is also what the fans hope for.</p>
<h3>Wedding Highlights of Female Volleyball Star Huang Xingfen</h3>
<p>In the world of women's volleyball, there is probably only one Miss Huang Xingfen who has enjoyed a reputation for more than a decade without diminishing. She played a major role in the Green Team's victory in the volleyball championship this year. Miss Huang married Mr. Yang Yicheng at the International Church at 3 pm yesterday. The reporter received an invitation and gladly went to congratulate them. Here are some highlights: Over a hundred male and female guests attended. In addition to the entire Green Team (except for Zhang Minzhi), those from the sports world included Yu Binqi, Li Zhenzhong and his wife, Cheng Hongsheng, and Tang Zuyi, etc. The atmosphere was filled with joy and excitement. Wei Wen unintentionally teased the bride, who couldn't help but smile</p>
<p>Amidst the piano music, the groom was first accompanied by the pastor, and the bride was accompanied by her uncle. They walked slowly to the melody of the wedding march. One was an elderly elder, and the other was a strong player dominating the volleyball court. Once they had to be so refined, taking one step and stopping for two steps, everyone laughed under the focused gaze of the audience. Midway, the bride's veil caught on the flowers along the way. Miss Yan Weiwen, with good intentions, leaned down and looked at the bride with affectionate eyes, and helped to pull up the veil. However, the bride thought she was teasing her, so the bride, full of joy, smiled, and the whole church burst into laughter! Kang Zuyi Was Very Busy, You Hongying Remained Silent</p>
<p>The photographer Mr. Kang was also very busy yesterday, taking many photos. Finally, he went to the garden to take a group photo with the Green Team in full uniform. Only Liu Zhenbao and Yan Weiwen were dressed in brand new clothes, as if they were attending a grand ceremony, with a unique charm. The team members stood on the left and right, with the bride standing in the center, everyone with a smile on their face. Only Miss You Hongying remained silent. After all, Miss You and the bride lived together day and night, inseparable. From now on, they would have fewer opportunities to do so, so how could she not be moved? Amidst a Chorus of Farewells, the Bride Still Made an Appointment to Practice</p>
<p>After the refreshments, amidst a chorus of farewells, the bride still frequently told the entire Green Team not to be late for Sunday's practice. Xie Yiqin told the reporter that this was probably just an excuse from the bride. During the honeymoon period, it is difficult to expect Xingfen to come to practice again.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Scenes</h3>
<p>○ Yan Youling, a member of the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor. In this tournament, he did not advocate playing on the field, but assisted Zhang Weixiang in planning on the sidelines. His deployment of troops was as brilliant as his medical skills, with the ability to bring the dying back to life. The Hualian team benefited greatly from it. ○ All the members of the Green Team's women's team are young ladies. Now, number one, Huang Xingfen, got married yesterday. Some say that number two, Zhang Minzhi, number three, Huang Mingyuan, and then number ten, Yang Wenjuan, will follow suit in order, but the latter will have to wait for a while. ○ Chen Weiyuan of the Renyu team values spirit the most. This gentleman is active in the basketball world and never argues with others. He is a model player. ○ Qu Yaokang, the initiator of the Chenyou Cup basketball tournament, has also been active in the football world recently. The arrival of Tianjin's famous goalkeeper Saidika in Shanghai was all thanks to Mr. Qu. ○ Han Longhai, a star player of Donghua, is a graduate of Jiaotong University. He was originally employed by Guanghua Silk Factory. Starting this month, he left Guanghua and joined the sales department of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, a giant in the local pharmaceutical industry. (King of Balls)</p>
<h3>Shantou Team Spirit</h3>
<p>The Shantou basketball team was established less than three years ago. From a Group B team, it was promoted to Group A, and is now one of the strongest basketball teams in Shanghai. The guidance of Lin Zuoshi is indispensable. According to sources, in addition to the Group A team, there are also the Shantou Group B, Black, and White teams. They are all fellow villagers from Shantou, aiming to connect the feelings of fellow villagers and exercise their bodies. It is merely a proper amateur pastime. Mr. Lin is also a lace merchant, setting up the Housheng Company on Tiantai Road. In addition to running his business, he only cares about the basketball team. His spirit is excellent and is highly supported by the Shantou community. Therefore, there are hundreds of fellow villagers supporting each game, so the Shantou people in Shanghai are becoming increasingly interested in sports. The future of the Shantou team is therefore extremely bright.</p>
