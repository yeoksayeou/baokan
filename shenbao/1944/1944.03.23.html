<p>社評</p>
<h3>贊助警察消費合作社</h3>
<p>本報三月一日社評，論「提高警察待遇」。因為警察的責任非常重大，而目前的待遇則非常菲薄。任受難於維持生活的待遇，而克　必須維護治安的責任，實際上確是困難的事。我們說過：警察的責任，是維護治安，警奸察宄，維持社會風氣，兼作人民師保。更進而言之，維護治安與警奸察宄，就須有不惜生命的胆量，有隨時應變的機智。維持社命風氣，兼作人民師保，就須有以身作則的高尚品格，有指導判斷的豐富知識。所以，從警察的責任以觀，對於警察的能力與素質，客觀要求應該是非常高而嚴的。我們姑以這種警察應有的責任爲依據，同時，是否相稱？是否合理？據十六日本市第一警察局為組織消費合作社事，蘇副局長在招待各界席上報告：「警察現在的薪俸，為每人每月一千二百元，與目前生活指數相比，實可令人　舌。在如此之情形下，員警之生活自屬清苦，而一方面因政府經費有限，無從前實際生活費用，即維持個人膳食，已感不敷。但誰無家屬，如以警察一萬人，家屬六萬人計算，則每一警察須負擔家屬六人之生活。以不足維持個人生活的月俸所入，同時須負担家屬穴人之生活，當然是極不可能的事。可是，束手待斃者究無其事。總之，所入不敷所出時，企圖增加收入以資挹注，乃為一致要求，所不同者僅在企圖挹注的方法而巳。其方法，固然有正當與不正當的區別，然而影響服務效率，不能克盡維護治安的任責，則並無一致。</p>
<p>根據上面的論述了我們認為警察的責任與目前的待遇，是極不相稱的。更可以說，如果警察的待遇不加調整，生活不加改善，則談不到爲市民服務，談不到擔負維護治安的責任。所以，我們在「提高警察待遇」社評中，主張當局應從速確定警政經費，提高警察待遇，使每名警察及其眷屬都能獲得最低的生活，而無後顧之憂，忠勤服務。</p>
<p>現在本市第一警察局組織消費合作社，購備日用生活品，平價配給與警察，使减少日常的消費負擔。平價配給日用品，當然是改善警察生舌主要之一種。直接改善警察生活，間接即所以加强維護治安的力量。從這一觀點，我們認為警察消費合作社的設立，全體市民都有協助促成的義務。據本日報載確息，該社正在積極籌備，先籌借資本四千萬元，分請本市銀錢業公會，市商會，市民福利協會二團體擔任分別籌墊，同時中儲行及華興銀行當局允予墊借鉅款，以示提倡贊助。深信熱心市政公益而具有資力人士中，抱其維護治安即所以維護事業的遠見者，必大有人在，我們竭誠期望踴躍墊借資金，使該社及早組成，使警察生活及早改善，使維護治安力量及早增强</p>
<p>最後，我們應更認清，大東亞戰爭已臨決戰階段，上海是後方重要基地，是戰時重要都市，維護治安，克盡後方基地的參戰任最多，所以改善警察生活，尤感刻不容緩。</p>
<h3>國民軍奪回土地即交印政府管理　日東條首相闡明援印決意</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　此次日印兩電先發制人，展開緬印國境作戰，兩軍即在緊密協刀下，到處擊潰英軍，現該方面作戰已突入進攻印度之第二階段，日東條首相頃發表談話，闡明印度國民軍奪回之印度國內各地域，即應置於印度臨時政府行政管理下之意、其大意如次；江特勒鮑斯主席指揮之印度國民軍，刻已在帝國軍隊協力下，開始印人熱望之祖國進軍。自由印度臨時政府成立後，僅半載即能實行果敢之進攻，洵堪同慶，印度四億民眾，在英國多年之暴政下呻吟，一經得悉捷報，彼等之歡喜情緒，吾人當不難想像。緣帝國之目的仍在擊碎敵人勢力，將印度完全委諸印人之手，凡國民軍奪回印度之土地、應即完全置於自由印度臨時政府行政管理之下。國民軍進擊聲中，已使印度民眾充滿愛祖國之熱情，五人甚為期待，其被解放地域急速擴大若是，則印度之獨立必能完成，獨立乃亞洲之總意，亦為世界正義之所歸，茍有明知印度之窘狀，而欲妨碍印度之解放者，即為正義之公敵。印度解放之前途，固尚有幾多障碍，余甚望與印度軍民相協力。突破一切困難，俾期國民軍繼續進攻，一路進至勝利之彼岸，爲支援國民軍，决不惜任何努力，於此特對世界闡明帝國之堅固決意。</p>
<h3>日印軍渡過兩河向印度境內挺進</h3>
<p>里斯本二十二日中央社電　日印同盟軍於渡過更的宛（Chindwin），馬尼布爾（Manipur）兩河後，即突破緬印國境，而向印度境內挺進。據新德里電:東南亞反軸心軍司令部二十二日曾發表戰况公報，承認上項事實，據稱:沿更的宛河展開攻勢之日印同盟軍，刻在山嶼地帶不斷進攻，現已突破國境一處至二處,而進入馬尼布爾國內.</p>
<h3>頓扎恩敵崩潰情形</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　據細甸前綫電，緬甸國境頓扎恩之敵軍，終告全綫崩潰，其實情如次：梯迭姆附近之英軍第十七師主力企圖逃脫，會於頓扎恩東二十五公里之巴義茲要塞及其西側阿爾蓋高地等地，布置十八口徑大砲十數門，頑强抵抗。自十四日以來，因不堪上午十時自巴義茲要塞撤退，該要塞即歸日軍掌握，十九日以來，敵見勢不佳，乃其如自馬尼布爾河扎恩西北卡匹河右岸之敵，以頓扎恩之自軍已陷於總崩潰，後部頓形空虛，故亦向西逃脫，然盡被日軍　滅，日軍於卡匹以右在擴大戰果中，　迭如·頓扎恩之敵軍，於馬尼布爾河畔，亦遭日軍之重大打擊，而演成琴丘陵之悲劇。</p>
<h3>要衝陷落企圖受挫</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　據緬甸前綫日軍某基地電：琴丘陵地帶英印軍，反攻緬甸之據點頓札恩，由於日印軍之猛攻，二十日終於陷落，該地距離琴丘陵印緬國境約四十公里，為一軍事要衝，今為日印軍佔領，敵軍已無立足之地。反攻企圖大受挫折，而緬甸之防衛熊勢　愈形强化，該地之陷落不僅為殲滅敵第十七師，予敵軍事上，政治上以大打擊，且對於印度及淪方亦有深刻影響。蓋該地為琴丘陵地帶之兵站基地，有大規模物資倉庫，負有接濟梯迭姆，岷卑爾方面等前綫軍需之重責，而為琴丘陵一帶活動之根源。一旦喪失，即再不能由琴丘陵地帶對緬甸作總反攻，故渝方一聞該地失陷，極為沮喪，對英·美更行不滿，該地戰前僅有三百戶，住有琴人約八百名，自英印軍駐防以來，人口驟增至萬人，其酋長賞札發現年四十八歲，有才有識，聲名車著，以受英政府壓迫，權限日減，年由英政府支俸二千盧比，久懷義　為該地唯一之反英家。</p>
<p>鮑斯發表聲明提五項要求促印人奮起爭取獨立</p>
<p>仰光二十二日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府廿一日發表聲明，促為爭取祖國獨立而奮鬥之印度民眾，把握千載一時之機會，并向其祖國同胞及其指導者，提出五項要求：　印度民眾爾直接間接予日印同盟軍以全幅之援助。　印度全體民眾，應努力推進印度獨立戰爭。　國內印度民眾應作有組織之意工，籍以阻止英美完成戰爭之進程，使吾人為爭取自由而推進之戰爭，得早日完成。　印度軍隊應　絕加人為英國而發動之戰爭，進而參加日印同盟軍之陣營。　供職於英政府之印人，應協力自由印度政府，完成比次之神聖作戰。該宣言最後勸告其同胞避開英·美軍之飛機塲，兵營，軍需工塲，港灣及軍事設備等地點。</p>
<p>仰光二十一日中央社電、自由印度臨時政府，頃用該政府主席及印度國民軍</p>
<h3>最高指揮</h3>
<p>官之名義，發表自由印度臨時政府聲明如次：口由印度臨時政府所統率之印度國民軍，賴日陸軍之密切協力，已開始從事神聖之使命。自西歷一八五七年印度軍與英侵人軍戰鬥失敗後，印度民眾終於在精神方面向英國投降，印度民眾雖受英國之非人道壓迫，並剝奪印人之武器”但印民眾仍繼續反抗英國之支配勞力，使用宜傳煽動或武力行動，罷工手段，或用武力革命。最近則由甘地氏展開不服從運動，而從事獨立鬥爭，且自</p>
<h3>此次戰爭</h3>
<p>勃發以來，英國爲進行其帝國主義之戰爭，致印度民眾不勝其生地已陷於空前大飢饉狀態，於是甘地氏為挽救戰火中之印度起見，　請英政府承認印度之獨立，將軍隊撤離印境，但英國竟將甘地及印度數萬憂國志士　獄，此種非人道行為，益昭然若揭。住居東亞三百萬印人，現為解放祖國，在政治方面業已成立印　獨立聯盟，在</p>
<h3>軍事方面</h3>
<p>則組織印度國民軍，自由印度臨時政府於一九四三年十月二十一日誕生後，印國民軍即積極整頓完畢，乃期於一九四四年二月四日，開始在緬甸阿拉坎地區自先舉起解放祖國神坐戰爭之烽火，日政府會迭向中外聲明謂：日本非僅為防衛日本而戰，乃期打倒在東亞之英帝國主義，同時日本並表明無條件援助印度獨立，其後日政府基於此方針之援助。當自由印度</p>
<h3>臨時政府</h3>
<p>成立之時，日本即立刻予以承認，同時並决定將安達曼及安科巴兩羣島讓與印度，故今日所求於印度愛國同胞者　努力作戰爭取印度之獨立。　為全體同胞於祖國內積極作有組織之怠工，以阻止英·美完成戰爭之途徑，此即促進吾人作戰之完成也。　印兵應拒絕為英國而戰，進而積極參加吾等之陣營。　受制於英國政府之印人，尤應協力吾等所推進之神聖戰爭。令日實為</p>

<h3>緬印邊境日軍完成大滅戰</h3>
<p>長驅突破敵陣，直衝其退路，並阻止企圖大舉索下的敵大部隊，由於久保挺身隊的活躍，苦戰一月，而完成了新塞華大殲滅戰，充分發揮日軍的真精神，而為各地各部隊同聲讚美。該部隊於五日突破充滿殘敵的敵軍陣地，全身浴血歸還友軍第一綫。印度國民軍數百名亦參加這一次突擊，與日軍精銳駢肩作戰，奠定了國民軍的光輝傳統。以下為久保挺身隊的戰鬥記：</p>
<h3>遮斷敵退路的命令</h3>
<p>二月四日，在頓古巴札强渡馬酋河的久保挺身隊及印度國民軍挺身〇〇隊，接到這樣一個命令：「我挺身像速於四白突進奈其安其耶，遮斷孟多附近的敵退路，並阻止巴里巴柴敵人南下。印度國民軍速即向奈其安其耶突進，担任破壤街市附近的橋極。並隨着主力部隊的進出，牽制南下之敵。」該部隊於暮色蒼茫中出發，向馬酋山脈的彼方，浩浩蕩藩突進，途中並未遇到抵抗，五日午後七時二十分，到達〇〇高地。</p>
<p>準備夜間估動的兵隊，立即休養、部隊長以下幹部，集合於俯瞰敵人的高地，研究夜襲計劃·下面充滿着敵人，是自動直集合區城，張有大幕七八所，人車出入頻緊，引擎　似即在鄰近，淸晰可聞。廣塲的石方有五六所營房港的汽軍路，烟塵滾滾，顯有自動車在來往着。自標就在遮斷那條這路。部隊長指着下面的一個個地點，詳細指示夜襲的計劃。午後九時，各部隊整列完畢，在星光微稀中，莫那瓦河猶如一條白帶。國民軍順利地破壞了橋樑，全體向敵陣突擊，在日軍勇士白刃的追迫下，東竄西奔，狼狽而逃。</p>
<p>自動車五六十輛頓時起火，火光照耀如白盡。此次攻擊，敵人完全不防，故陷於大亂，集中砲火更向這起火地點發射，計燒　自動車百輛，遣業屍體三十，俘虜三士。</p>
<h3>敵方反攻</h3>
<p>六日起，因日軍急襲的結果，敵人開始南北均以奈其安其耶為中心調動。七日，日軍更急襲奈其安其耶，以期徹底遍斷。即國民軍能爲急襲該部落北方六公里的二〇一高地，本隊則乘際再度炸毀其橋樑。入日夜，為確實遮斷敵退路起見，更完全炸毀該部落南方的橋樑。九日午後，數百敵軍以重戰車四輛為前導，得戰車砲射擊的掩護，突然前來反攻。此自在日軍意料中，大砲齊向敵自動車一齊射擊使之起火，降即擊退。</p>
<p>十日、陣地前面有敵人三百，持有砲四門，戰車二輛，前來襲擊，每次均被擊退。十日夜，强襲敵陣，獲致遺棄屍體十，擱置車輛十數輛的戰果。在奈其安其耶部落北方敷設地雷·至十一日，敵逐漸向日軍正面增加兵力。日軍部隊於該夜再度炸毀橋樑。十二日起，敵反攻愈烈。用砲五六門，迫擊砲四門，向日軍陣地肉搏前來。但仍被日軍擊退，遣棄屍體百五十。繼於十四日正午，敵人約千名，有砲十門，從三面前來攻擊，日軍不後退一步，毅然加以擊退。</p>
<h3>迴避敵方壓力</h3>
<p>十六日，在南北西三面十字砲火的交射下，日軍損失漸多，乃迂回側面，向　　轉變陣地，迥避從西方來的壓尚不知日軍部隊業已轉變陣地，向　　集中猛烈砲火。該部降在一切均感困苦缺乏的情形下，苦戰一月，總得確保此要點，完遂其任務。於二十五日長從奈其安其耶東方出發，踏上歸途。途中困難重重，二十九日夕、到達該地，</p>
<p>一日晨，從該地出發，五日晨，歸還口軍第一綫。</p>
<p>在此期間、因不明地形，加以慶次與敵遭遇交戰的結果，軍馬均疲弊不堪，如大砲等均不得已用人力運輸，一日僅能前進五百米，但終於順利克服重重難關，突破敵陣，歸還基地。新塞華方面的鐵滅戰，因有這一支挺身隊的奮鬥，始能成功。（　：譯自三月十。東京朝日薪聞）</p>
<h3>敵方承認作戰困難</h3>
<p>以英少將加斯普里奇爲委員長的應·美·加海空軍將校所組成的軍事視察團，前曾視察綫”最近到達印度，目敗績，並視察北部國境富康區城的渝軍，現已返回倫敦，向反軸心軍參謀長會議作最後報告。該團於三日會見記者國時，承認緬甸戰綫的深刻兩難：</p>
<p>「從阿拉干至萊多的緬甸戰綫，在某幾點上，比太平洋更為困難。例如在南太平洋，反軸心軍的海空勢力得威脅日軍長大的交通棧，但在緬甸，日軍到處有良好的交通綫，各地有米，各河川有魚。反之，反軸心軍的交通綫都比日軍困難。視察此戰綫的結果，確信日本軍人殆為超人。」</p>
<p>加斯普里奇又稱：</p>
<p>「緬甸决不是平易的作戰區域，比太平洋更為困難。」</p>
<p>可見敵方也已自認大東亞要塞的堅不可拔的形勢（翔：譯自三月七日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界評言</p>
<h3>再論經濟警察</h3>
<p>「工欲善其事，必先利其器·」無疑地，經濟警察，在理論上，自為　淸積極抑平物價的利器，因為囤積物資與抬高物價同為戰時所景忌的經濟事　，以其影響所及，市塲受其擾亂，民生蒙其危害，殊是招致最惡劣而且戰車的後果，所以，　時日本對於一切經濟犯罪者，執法如山，不稱寬貸，故能建榭其統制經濟的偉績，而最近國府對於貪污國積之　　，亦足證明『重　」之下，始可一挽頹風，執法以　，始能制止一切暴利思想的澎湃與投機行為的猖獗·</p>
<p>經濟警察的惟一任務，就是對於不正當業者從事投　囤積，而觸犯經濟法規者，隨時加以徹底之調查與肅淸，可是，這種任務之能否執行，須　經濟警察機構的本身是否健全。假定一個經濟警察是「己不正而　人以正」的話，那是不如沒有經濟警察之為愈了！我們以前也曾論過經濟警察，認為廣泛的知識與　潔的操守為其最主要的條件：假定知識既極淺陋。行為復極卑鄙，那末，經濟警察之設立，非但不足以保民，抑且足以殃民了！</p>
<p>因為最近當局鑒於物價問題愈　戲重，正在研究協　新經濟警察幾構之成立，把歷來分散存在之各重機構，加以撤裁，所以我們再輸經濟警察，並寄予我們最大的期待。</p>

<h3>股票實業志回顧及前瞻</h3>
<p>— 杜干孺</p>
<p>當去年股票事業發展之初，正是各種投機市塲日薄　　之際，所以未幾何時，即呈蓬勃繁榮之象。昔日之說券交易所，亦應運而生，東山再起，於是一般狡黠的資本家，利用時機，增資的增資，招股的招股，風起震湧，彼效此尤，而一時利慾薰心之輩，弄得目迷心眩，　　解囊，唯恐落後。</p>
<p>筆者當時目擊現狀，一回憶二十年前之各交易所本所股風潮，怒焉憂之，就把增資招股的內幕，分析考慮，就覺得疑擴發生。固然公司廠商的財產價値，較戰前漲起許多倍，自有升値增資的必要，但是最須明暸的一點，就是公司廠商的全部財產，本是股東的財產，增也好，不增也好，其本身早已隨物價而升値，增資贈戰，於股東之利益，實無增滅。所以我以為公司當局的增資，猶如狙公的手腕，朝三暮四，故弄女虛，至於增資尙須股東續繳血太者，更為其手腕之高妙，面股票之價格，亦因此刺激而上升，引得一般盲目投機者，不顧利害，紛紛參加增　認股之一途，有朝投資暮發財之氣劣。</p>
<p>譬如去年底新創之基公司，招股一萬萬元，不旋踴間，認繳一空，未牟月，股票價格，即已漲此票面一倍許，試問公司尙未營業，盈餘從何獲得，此倍許之價格，依據何點而上漲？如此一想，就覺虛空危險，無與倫比。果然一入新年，初則銀根　縮，繼而取締新股票上市，遂使從事股票買賣者，恍如冷水澆頂，迷夢初，爭相脫手，市價慘跌，甚至有跌進票面之內者，影響社會，為審補匪淺，瞻望前途，心所為危·</p>
<p>然則股票事業，就此　蹶不振乎？此則又未盡市，尤須嚴格審查，不稍寬容，是則股票事業，即能永垂不壓焉。海軍岩田雙織著洪　洋譯十一月八日（火　）晴·</p>

        <h1>1944.03.23</h1>
<h3>Supporting the Police Cooperative</h3>
<p>Our editorial on March 1st, "Improving Police Treatment," discussed that the responsibilities of the police are extremely significant, while their current treatment is quite meager. Assigning the responsibility of maintaining public order while struggling with a sustenance-level income is indeed a difficult matter. We have stated that the police's responsibility is to maintain public order, investigate and eliminate corrupt elements within the police force, uphold social ethics, and serve as both teachers and protectors of the people. Furthermore, maintaining public order and investigating corrupt police require not only the courage to risk one's life but also the adaptability to respond to changing situations. Upholding social ethics and serving as teachers and protectors of the people require not only a high moral character of leading by example but also a wealth of knowledge for guidance and judgment. Therefore, from the perspective of the police's responsibilities, the objective requirements for their ability and quality should be very high and strict. Let us use these expected responsibilities of the police as a basis to examine whether the current treatment matches the responsibilities and whether it is reasonable. According to the report by Deputy Bureau Chief Su at the reception for all sectors held by the First Police Bureau of this city on the 16th regarding the establishment of a consumer cooperative, "The current salary of the police is 1,200 yuan per person per month, which, compared to the current cost of living, is truly appalling. Under such circumstances, the lives of the police officers are naturally austere. On the one hand, the government's funds are limited, making it impossible to meet actual living expenses. Even maintaining personal meals is challenging. However, everyone has family members. If we estimate that for 10,000 police officers, there are 60,000 family members, then each police officer must support the lives of six family members. It is naturally impossible to support the lives of six family members with a monthly salary that is insufficient to maintain personal life. However, no one is simply waiting for death. In short, when income is less than expenditure, attempting to increase income to supplement it is a universal demand. The only difference lies in the methods of attempting to supplement it. While there are distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate methods, there is no difference in how it affects service efficiency and the ability to fulfill the responsibility of maintaining public order."</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, we believe that the responsibilities of the police are extremely disproportionate to their current treatment. Furthermore, it can be said that if the treatment of the police is not adjusted and their living conditions are not improved, there is no point in talking about serving the citizens or shouldering the responsibility of maintaining public order. Therefore, in our editorial "Improving Police Treatment," we advocate that the authorities should promptly determine police funding and improve the treatment of the police so that every police officer and their families can obtain a minimum standard of living, have no worries about the future, and serve with loyalty and diligence.</p>
<p>Now, the First Police Bureau of this city is organizing a consumer cooperative to purchase daily necessities and distribute them to the police at affordable prices, thereby reducing the burden of daily consumption. Providing daily necessities at affordable prices is certainly one of the main ways to improve the lives of the police. Directly improving the lives of the police indirectly strengthens the power to maintain public order. From this perspective, we believe that all citizens have an obligation to assist in the establishment of the police consumer cooperative. According to the news reported in today's newspaper, the cooperative is actively preparing, first raising a capital of 40 million yuan. The city's Banking Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the Citizens Welfare Association are invited to separately raise funds. At the same time, the Central Trust of China and the China Development Bank have agreed to provide large loans to show their support. It is deeply believed that among those who are enthusiastic about municipal public welfare and have the financial resources, there must be many who hold the foresight that maintaining public order is maintaining their own businesses. We sincerely hope that they will enthusiastically provide loans so that the cooperative can be established as soon as possible, the lives of the police can be improved as soon as possible, and the power to maintain public order can be strengthened as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we should further recognize that the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. Shanghai is an important rear base and a vital wartime city. Maintaining public order and fulfilling the wartime participation duty of the rear base is of utmost importance. Therefore, improving the lives of the police is even more urgent.</p>
<h3>The National Army Returns Land to the Indian Government for Management. Prime Minister Tojo Clarifies His Determination to Assist India.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The coordinated preemptive strikes by the Japanese and Indian armies have commenced operations on the Burma-India border. The two armies are closely coordinating, routing British forces everywhere. These operations have now entered the second phase of advancing into India. Prime Minister Tojo recently issued a statement clarifying that all regions within India retaken by the Indian National Army should be placed under the administrative control of the Provisional Government of India. The gist of his statement is as follows: The Indian National Army, under the command of Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose, has, with the cooperation of the Imperial Army, begun the long-awaited advance into their homeland. Only half a year after the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, it has been able to carry out a bold offensive, which is truly cause for celebration. The 400 million people of India, groaning under years of British tyranny, will undoubtedly be overjoyed upon hearing this news. The Empire's purpose remains to crush the enemy's forces and completely hand over India to the Indian people. All land retaken by the National Army in India should be placed completely under the administrative control of the Provisional Government of Free India. The advance of the National Army has filled the Indian people with a passion for their homeland. We expect that the rapid expansion of the liberated areas will lead to the completion of Indian independence. Independence is the consensus of Asia and the demand of world justice. Anyone who is aware of India's plight and seeks to obstruct its liberation is a public enemy of justice. While there are still many obstacles to the liberation of India, I sincerely hope to cooperate with the Indian military and civilians to overcome all difficulties, so that the National Army can continue its advance all the way to the shores of victory. We will spare no effort to support the National Army. Hereby, I specifically declare the Empire's firm determination to the world.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Indian Armies Cross Two Rivers and Advance into India</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After crossing the Chindwin and Manipur rivers, the Japanese-Indian allied forces broke through the Burma-India border and advanced into India. According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters issued a war bulletin on the 22nd acknowledging the above facts, stating that the Japanese-Indian allied forces, which launched an offensive along the Chindwin River, are continuously attacking in the mountainous areas and have broken through the border at one or two points, entering Manipur.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Enemy at Tiddim-Tongzang</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the front lines of Burma, the enemy forces at Tiddim-Tongzang on the Burmese border have finally collapsed completely. The details are as follows: The main force of the British 17th Division near Tiddim attempted to escape but encountered strong resistance at the Paiz strategic point, 25 kilometers east of Tongzang, and the Algae heights to its west, where they deployed dozens of 18-caliber artillery pieces. Since the 14th, they were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated from the Paiz strategic point at 10:00 AM. The strategic point was then taken over by the Japanese army. Since the 19th, seeing the situation was unfavorable, they retreated westward from the enemy on the right bank of the Kaphi River northwest of Tongzang on the Manipur River, as the Tongzang self-defense forces had collapsed and the rear was empty. However, they were wiped out by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is expanding its gains on the right of the Kaphi River. The enemy forces at Tiddim-Tongzang were also severely struck by the Japanese army on the banks of the Manipur River, resulting in the tragedy of the Chin Hills.</p>
<h3>Capture of a Strategic Point, Attempt Frustrated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front lines, Tongzang, the British-Indian army's base for a counterattack on Burma in the Chin Hills area, finally fell on the 20th due to the fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian army. The area is about 40 kilometers from the Chin Hills-Burma border and is a military stronghold. Now that it is occupied by the Japanese-Indian army, the enemy army has no foothold. The counterattack attempt was greatly frustrated, and Burma's defense situation has become stronger. The fall of the area not only annihilated the enemy's 17th Division, inflicting a major blow on the enemy militarily and politically, but also had a profound impact on India and the occupied territories. The area is a supply base in the Chin Hills area, with large-scale material warehouses, responsible for supplying the front lines in Tiddim, Minbya, and other areas, and is the source of activity in the Chin Hills area. Once lost, a general counterattack on Burma cannot be launched from the Chin Hills area. Therefore, when the Chongqing side heard of the fall of the area, they were extremely frustrated and even more dissatisfied with Britain and the United States. Before the war, there were only 300 households in the area, with about 800 Chin people. Since the British-Indian army was stationed there, the population has soared to 10,000. Its chief, Shawza, discovered that he was 48 years old, talented and knowledgeable, and famous. Due to being oppressed by the British government and having his authority reduced daily, he received a salary of 2,000 rupees from the British government and had long been a righteous man and the only anti-British figure in the area.</p>
<p>Bose Issues Statement Making Five Demands, Urging Indians to Rise Up and Fight for Independence</p>
<p>Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India issued a statement on the 21st urging the Indian people fighting for the independence of their homeland to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and put forward five demands to their compatriots and their leaders: 　Indian people should provide full assistance, directly or indirectly, to the Japanese-Indian allied forces. 　All Indian people should strive to promote the Indian war of independence. 　The Indian people in the country should carry out organized sabotage in order to prevent the British and Americans from completing the war process, so that the war we are promoting for freedom can be completed as soon as possible. 　The Indian army should refuse to join the war launched for Britain, and instead join the ranks of the Japanese-Indian allied forces. 　Indians working for the British government should assist the Free India government in completing this sacred operation. The declaration finally advised their compatriots to avoid airfields, barracks, munitions factories, harbors, and military facilities of the British and American forces.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India, in the name of the Chairman of the Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian National Army</p>
<h3>Supreme Command</h3>
<p>issued the following statement from the Provisional Government of Free India: The Indian National Army, led by the Provisional Government of Free India, with the close cooperation of the Japanese Army, has begun a sacred mission. Since the failure of the Indian army in its battle with the British invaders in 1857, the Indian people have finally surrendered to Britain in spirit. Although the Indian people have suffered inhuman oppression from Britain and have been deprived of weapons, the Indian people have continued to resist British rule by using propaganda, agitation, or military action, strikes, or armed revolution. Recently, Gandhi launched a non-violent disobedience movement to engage in the struggle for independence, and since</p>
<h3>This War</h3>
<p>broke out, Britain, in order to carry out its imperialist war, has caused the Indian people to be unable to bear their lives and have fallen into an unprecedented famine. Therefore, in order to save India from the flames of war, Gandhi requested the British government to recognize India's independence and withdraw its troops from India, but Britain has imprisoned Gandhi and tens of thousands of patriotic Indian people. This inhuman behavior is even more obvious. Three million Indians residing in East Asia have now established the Indian Independence League in the political sphere in order to liberate their homeland, and in the</p>
<h3>Military Sphere</h3>
<p>they have organized the Indian National Army. After the Provisional Government of Free India was born on October 21, 1943, the Indian National Army was actively reorganized and completed, and on February 4, 1944, it began to raise the torch of the liberation of the homeland in the Arakan region of Burma. The Japanese government has repeatedly declared at home and abroad that Japan is not only fighting to defend Japan, but also to defeat British imperialism in East Asia. At the same time, Japan has also stated that it will unconditionally assist India's independence. Later, the Japanese government based its assistance on this policy. When the Provisional</p>
<h3>Provisional Government</h3>
<p>of India was established, Japan immediately recognized it, and also decided to cede the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to India. Therefore, what is requested of patriotic Indian compatriots today is to strive to fight for India's independence. For all compatriots to actively carry out organized sabotage in the homeland to prevent Britain and the United States from completing the path of war, this is to promote the completion of our operation. Indian soldiers should refuse to fight for Britain and instead actively join our ranks. Indians subject to the British government should especially assist us in the sacred war we are promoting. Today is indeed</p>
<h3>Realizing Freedom</h3>
<p>the best opportunity, and if you can perform your due tasks at this time, then the time for India to gain freedom will not be far away.</p>

After the meeting, the Indian people held a heated parade in excitement.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Confirmed as Deputy Commander</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi states: The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters has acknowledged that General Stilwell, commander of the British India-Burma-China Expeditionary Force, assumed the position of Deputy Commander of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Mount Vesuvius Erupts, Rocks Reach 1,200 Feet High</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, the director of the Vesuvius Observatory, Mr. Cippo, told Reuters defender Mr. Sprigge that Vesuvius is now ejecting one million cubic meters of rock every hour. This situation does not seem sustainable for more than a few days. There is a risk that the city of Seccola will be attacked by ejected rocks tonight, and Sangiovo and Portici may also be attacked in succession. The Anti-Axis commanders listened to Mr. Cippo's advice and evacuated the people of Seccola and other places. Mr. Smith pointed out that at 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM yesterday evening, the amount of ejected rocks and lava was very large. The ejected rocks reached a height of 1,200 feet, and the ejected lava reached a height of one mile, which is truly alarming. However, Mr. Cippo insisted that this eruption phenomenon is different from the phenomenon when the mountain was buried by the volcano.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces Complete Major Annihilation Battle on the Burma-India Border</h3>
<p>By breaking through enemy lines in a swift advance, striking directly at their retreat route, and preventing large enemy units attempting a major southward retreat, the Kubo Assault Force played a decisive role. After a month of arduous fighting, they completed the annihilation battle of Sinzweya, fully demonstrating the true spirit of the Japanese army and earning the praise of units everywhere. On the 5th, this unit broke through enemy positions teeming with remaining enemy soldiers, returning to the front lines of the friendly forces covered in blood. Several hundred soldiers from the Indian National Army also participated in this attack, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the elite Japanese troops, establishing the glorious tradition of the National Army. The following is the battle record of the Kubo Assault Force:</p>
<h3>Order to Cut Off Enemy Retreat Route</h3>
<p>On February 4th, the Kubo Assault Force and the Indian National Army Assault 〇〇 Force, which had crossed the Mayu River at Tong Bazar, received the following order: "Our Assault Force will rapidly advance to Nakyangan, cutting off the enemy's retreat route near Maungdaw and preventing the enemy from moving south to Palibazar. The Indian National Army will immediately advance to Nakyangan, taking responsibility for destroying bridges near the streets, and, along with the advance and retreat of the main force, will contain the enemy moving south." The unit departed in the fading twilight, advancing mightily towards the Mayu Mountains. They encountered no resistance along the way, and at 7:20 PM on the 5th, they reached 〇〇 Heights.</p>
<p>The troops, preparing for a nighttime operation, immediately rested. Officers, including the unit commander, gathered on the high ground overlooking the enemy to study the night assault plan. Below them, the area was teeming with enemy activity. It was an automatic collection zone, with seven or eight large tents set up. People and vehicles were frequently entering and leaving. The sound of engines seemed to be nearby and was clearly audible. In the square, there were five or six barrack-like gasoline roads, and smoke and dust billowed, indicating that automobiles were moving about. The target was to cut off that road. The unit commander pointed to each location below, giving detailed instructions for the night assault plan. At 9:00 PM, all units completed their alignment. Under the faint starlight, the Monawa River resembled a white ribbon. The National Army successfully destroyed the bridges, and the entire force launched an attack on the enemy positions. Under the relentless pursuit of the Japanese warriors, they fled in disarray, scattering in all directions.</p>
<p>Fifty or sixty automobiles were instantly set ablaze, their fires illuminating the area like daylight. The enemy was completely unprepared for this attack and fell into utter chaos. Concentrated artillery fire was directed at the burning area, destroying an estimated one hundred automobiles, thirty abandoned corpses, and capturing three soldiers.</p>
<h3>Enemy Counterattack</h3>
<p>From the 6th, as a result of the Japanese army's surprise attack, the enemy began to mobilize both north and south, centering on Nakyangan. On the 7th, the Japanese army launched another surprise attack on Nakyangan, hoping to completely cut it off. That is, the National Army was able to launch a surprise attack on the 201 Heights, six kilometers north of the village, while the main force once again destroyed its bridges. Day and night, in order to reliably cut off the enemy's retreat route, the bridges south of the village were completely destroyed. On the afternoon of the 9th, several hundred enemy soldiers, led by four heavy tanks and covered by tank fire, suddenly launched a counterattack. This was expected by the Japanese army. The artillery fired simultaneously at the enemy automobiles, setting them on fire and immediately repelling the attack.</p>
<p>On the 10th, three hundred enemy soldiers, with four artillery pieces and two tanks, attacked in front of the position, but each time they were repelled. On the night of the 10th, a strong assault on the enemy positions resulted in ten abandoned corpses and the capture of a dozen vehicles. Mines were laid north of the Nakyangan village. By the 11th, the enemy had gradually increased its strength on the Japanese army's front. The Japanese army unit destroyed the bridges again that night. From the 12th, the enemy counterattack became more intense, using five or six artillery pieces and four mortars to attack the Japanese army's positions with bayonets. However, they were still repelled by the Japanese army, leaving behind one hundred and fifty corpses. Subsequently, at noon on the 14th, approximately one thousand enemy soldiers, with ten artillery pieces, attacked from three directions. The Japanese army did not retreat a single step, resolutely repelling the attack.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Enemy Pressure</h3>
<p>On the 16th, under the crossfire of artillery from the north, south, and west, the Japanese army suffered increasing losses. They bypassed the flank and shifted their position toward the 　　, avoiding the pressure from the west. The enemy, unaware that the Japanese army unit had already shifted its position, concentrated intense artillery fire on the 　　. Under conditions of hardship and scarcity, the unit fought arduously for a month, finally securing this key point and completing its mission. On the 25th, they departed east of Nakyangan and embarked on their return journey. The journey was fraught with difficulties. On the evening of the 29th, they arrived at that location.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 1st, they departed from that location, and on the morning of the 5th, they returned to the front lines of the 〇 army.</p>
<p>During this period, due to unfamiliar terrain and frequent encounters with the enemy, the military horses were exhausted. Artillery and other supplies had to be transported by manpower, advancing only 500 meters per day, but they finally overcame numerous difficulties, broke through enemy lines, and returned to base. The annihilation battle of Sinzweya was successful because of the efforts of this assault force. (　: Translated from the March 10th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Enemy Admits Operational Difficulties</h3>
<p>A military inspection group composed of naval and air force officers from Britain, the United States, and Canada, headed by British Major General Gascoigne, had previously inspected the "Line." They recently arrived in India, having witnessed the defeat and inspected the Chinese army in the Hukawng Valley region of the northern border. They have now returned to London to present their final report to the Anti-Axis Chiefs of Staff. The group met with reporters on the 3rd, admitting the deep dilemma of the Burma front:</p>
<p>"The Burma front, from Arakan to Ledo, is more difficult in some respects than the Pacific. For example, in the South Pacific, the sea and air power of the Anti-Axis forces can threaten the Japanese army's long lines of communication, but in Burma, the Japanese army has good lines of communication everywhere. There is rice everywhere, and fish in every river. In contrast, the Anti-Axis forces have more difficult lines of communication than the Japanese army. As a result of inspecting this front, we are convinced that Japanese soldiers are almost superhuman."</p>
<p>Gascoigne added:</p>
<p>"Burma is by no means an easy area of operations, and is more difficult than the Pacific."</p>
<p>It can be seen that the enemy has also acknowledged the impregnable nature of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (翔: Translated from the March 7th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Re-discussing Economic Police</h3>
<p>"If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Undoubtedly, economic police are theoretically a sharp tool for actively suppressing price gouging. Because hoarding materials and raising prices are both economic evils to be avoided during wartime. Because of their impact, the market is disrupted, and the people's livelihood is harmed, which is bound to lead to the worst and most disastrous consequences. Therefore, wartime Japan enforced the law strictly on all economic criminals without leniency. Thus, it was able to build its great achievements in controlled economy. Recently, the National Government's treatment of corrupt officials is enough to prove that only under "heavy punishment" can the declining trend be reversed, and only with strict law enforcement can the surge of all profiteering ideas and the rampant speculation be curbed.</p>
<p>The only task of the economic police is to thoroughly investigate and crack down on unscrupulous businesses engaging in speculation and hoarding and violating economic regulations at any time. However, whether this task can be executed depends on whether the economic police organization itself is sound. If an economic policeman is "impure himself but wants to correct others," it is better not to have economic police at all! We have also discussed economic police before, believing that broad knowledge and integrity are their most important conditions. If their knowledge is very shallow and their behavior is very despicable, then the establishment of economic police will not only be insufficient to protect the people but will also be sufficient to harm them!</p>
<p>Because the authorities have recently realized that the price issue is becoming more and more serious, they are studying the coordination and establishment of a new economic police organization, abolishing the various dispersed organizations that have existed in the past. Therefore, we are re-discussing economic police and placing our greatest expectations on them.</p>

<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the exchange rate of the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank of China should be handled at 18 yuan per 100 yuan, which has already been stipulated and circulated by the ministry. It has recently been found that the market price of the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank of China reported in various newspapers in Shanghai sometimes exceeds the stipulated rate, which is very inconsistent. The ministry has ordered the office to quickly strengthen the crackdown in order to stabilize the financial situation and comply with the regulations. It is heard that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office is currently investigating and strengthening the crackdown in order to comply with the laws and stabilize the financial situation.</p>

<h3>A Review and Outlook on the Stock Industry</h3>
<p>— Du Ganru</p>
<p>When the stock market began to develop last year, it was precisely at a time when various speculative markets were declining. Therefore, before long, it showed a vigorous and prosperous appearance. The former securities exchanges also emerged in response to the times and made a comeback. As a result, some cunning capitalists seized the opportunity to increase capital and solicit shares. They rose like a storm, and they followed suit. For a time, those who were blinded by greed were dizzy and eagerly opened their wallets, fearing falling behind.</p>
<p>At that time, the author witnessed the current situation, recalled the stock craze of various exchanges twenty years ago, and was angry and worried about it. After analyzing and considering the inside story of capital increase and share solicitation, I felt that doubts arose. It is true that the property value of companies and manufacturers has risen many times compared with before the war, and it is necessary to increase value and capital. However, the most important point to clarify is that the entire property of companies and manufacturers is the property of shareholders. Whether it is increased or not, it has already appreciated with prices. Increasing capital does not increase or decrease the interests of shareholders. Therefore, I believe that the capital increase by the company authorities is like the trick of a monkey trainer, changing in the morning and evening, deliberately making a mystery. As for the fact that shareholders still have to pay blood money for the capital increase, it is even more ingenious. The price of the stock also rises due to this stimulation, attracting ordinary blind speculators to participate in the way of increasing the stock and subscribing for shares, with the inferior atmosphere of investing in the morning and getting rich in the evening.</p>
<p>For example, at the end of last year, a newly created base company raised 100 million yuan of shares, and in no time, the subscription was empty. Within a month, the stock price had already risen by more than double the face value. I would like to ask where the company has not yet operated and where the profit comes from. On what basis does this double the price rise? Thinking about it this way, I feel that it is empty, dangerous, and unparalleled. As expected, once entering the new year, first the funds were tightened, and then new stocks were banned from being listed. This made those who were engaged in stock trading feel like cold water was poured on their heads, and their dreams were shattered. They scrambled to sell their stocks, and the market price plummeted, even falling within the face value, affecting society. The review is not insignificant, and the prospects are worrying.</p>
<p>So, will the stock industry collapse from this? This is not entirely true. Strict inspection is still necessary, and no leniency is allowed. Then the stock industry can last forever. Written by Haijun Iwata, translated by Hong Yang, November 8 (Tuesday), sunny.</p>
<h3>Diary of a Real Person (5)</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hoped that the parents of the young people would come to the school. I was moved by their rigorous maturity. I invited them to visit the inverted son and the chief short boat.</p>
<p>After sending the Xiao and others away, there was a speech by General Takeshita. Lieutenant Colonel Guangzhong, who has become a war god, was also a figure who was forged during his student days, which is very touching.</p>
<p>November 12 (Saturday) Afternoon, sunny.</p>
<p>It is indeed a rare phenomenon for snow to fall in November. It is really cold to practice short rafting and aquatics. Buying snow can penetrate the skin like a knife, but when I think of our future life on the ship, I know that this is a normal state.</p>
<p>The general short boat started late and fell to eleventh place, which is a pity.</p>
<p>November 27 (Sunday) Sunny.</p>
<p>There is a classmate meeting. Due to the announcement of the instructor, I heard that Colonel Okashita and Captain Okashita were wounded in battle, and we could not be idle and self-advancing. We, who must step on the front line within a year, must work hard so as not to leave a bad name after death.</p>
<p>December 9 (Friday) Sunny.</p>
<p>Training in martial arts. Rouwei must also work harder. However, I must obtain the second dan before graduation. I want to be twice as powerful as others. This is something that Ping has realized.</p>
<p>December 19 (Sunday) Sunny.</p>
<p>During morning education, there was a lecture on the Japanese sword. I deeply feel that there is a soldier's heart on the Japanese sword.</p>
<p>The No. 4 rifle was rusted and was severely reprimanded. This kind of thing must never happen again in the future.</p>
<p>December 23 (Friday) Rain.</p>
<p>Because of yesterday's vaccination, my left wrist has been aching since morning. Thinking of the warriors on the front line who are still advancing despite their injuries, I can't hurt anymore. A military parade exercise will be held in two days. Although it has not rained on my skin, the wrist is painful with the cold rain. I must practice harder. No matter what, if I do it with responsibility, I will not feel difficult.</p>
<p>Sky and Sea (1)</p>
<p>After the end of this diary, another half year has passed. The real people are waiting for the pressure of the times, which makes them graduate early. Not only has the Chinese Incident passed three years, but the sound of cannons is also alarming in the sky above Nomonhan, and in Washington, a statement has also been issued on the termination of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. For students graduating from school at that time, it can be said to be a recent graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Gu Changren's twenty-first summer—that small body, full skin, and twinkling eyes, and his attitude has also calmed down. Compared with when he entered school, it seems like two people. He is a light-trained saber, and he only needs to be wasted from now on.</p>
<p>(To step on the wide sea, boundless, the surging sea...)</p>
<p>This morning, when I put on that last student military uniform, I suddenly felt a sense of generosity and tragedy. Bidding farewell to the student festival that I was used to living in, and the excitement of stepping on the ocean, the emotions of joy and sorrow intertwined, and a tear floated on the edge of the limit.</p>
<h3>Economical Methods for Water Use in Student Equipment</h3>
<p>Since this city restricted the consumption of water mines, it has not only become a serious problem for factories, but also makes it quite difficult to live at home. It is heard that some people have been fined for exceeding the water limit. If it is impossible to develop new sources, then we can only think about reducing expenses. If there are flush toilets at home, it is better not to flush the water in the tank, but to use used water instead of the water in the tank for flushing the toilet. The method is to simply collect the used water in a lead bucket or a wooden bucket in each household. When you want to flush the toilet, just pour the water into the toilet at once, but you must pour a bucket of water at a time, otherwise the pressure is not enough to take effect. This move is simple and easy to implement, and the waste water can also be used for fire fighting. Frugal people may want to try it. (Xi Huancheng)</p>
<h3>Rickshaws Should Be Painted White to Prevent Hitting Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Recently, due to air defense at night, rickshaws cannot turn on their lights, resulting in pedestrians being hit by cars. To ensure safety, it is best to paint the car handles and backs white so that pedestrians can easily recognize them and avoid being hit. (Pedestrian)</p>
<h3>Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory Donates Meningitis Preventative</h3>
<p>The Xinxing Chemical Preventive Special Agent "Brand Meningitis Preventive Special Agent" "Baifuman" (Pasulfamtde) industry to help prevent it. According to the "Baifuman" is one of the sulfur amine preparations derivative, its way to take one tablet after breakfast every day or every other day (children half, infants one-third to one-quarter) taking a week, will be able to prevent the work, but after taking this medicine, avoid eating eggs, alcohol and green onions, taking laxatives and those suffering from malignant anemia should not take it. As for those who have already contracted meningitis, they should be immediately sent to an isolation hospital. The special chemical treatment agent is "Sulfanyridine," one of the factory's products. Anyone with meningitis who is diagnosed by a doctor but cannot afford the "Sulfanyridine" drug fee must provide a letter of introduction and a prescription from the attending physician for free supply, but only five people are temporarily limited.</p>
