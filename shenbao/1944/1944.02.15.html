<p>社評</p>
<h3>助學和國民義務敎育</h3>
<p>我們辦理本屆助學金，發現與以往不同的一件事，就是小學生申請人數的衆多。現在核准的舊生七百餘人，新生八百餘人，已見報載。舊生因成績不好而落選的有一百餘人，新生因成績不好而落選的有近千人，總計來館申請補助的小學生在二千人以上·我們更聯想到小學生們往其他國體機關申請的，更有已經失學的小學生們根本沒有請求補助的。約略計算，全上海至少有一萬個以上的失學兒童，這眞是一件大事！</p>
<p>我們受讀者付託之重，辦理助學事務，始終認定：「捐款是讀者的血汗，我們要拿血汗的工作來報答讀者」。我們規定了「淸寒優秀」四個字的標準，切實遵照，絕不通融。外界或許認爲過於嚴格，可是我們覺得，惟有這樣，方才對得住讀者·臘底年初，正是人們狂歡的時候，也正是同人等和贊助我們的許多先生們埋首於申請書，登記表，成績單，家况調查報吿，分級名單，分組考試等等表冊之中，夜以繼日的工作着·在這裏，我們得到比看戲，比吃飯更有趣的興味，在精神上更得到無上的安慰，我們替申報讀者做了這些微的工作，申報讀者却替中華民國又拖上了幾步·</p>
<p>對於小學部份，自始就規定以高小爲限。本意有二點，　初小學費比較輕，　四年初小敎育，無論如何，應該是兒童的家長親友們的責任·可是現在情形不同了，初小學費的增加己經到了並非任何人都能負擔的地步·這一屆申請登記的時候，就有許多初小學生由他們的老年家長伴着來館，等到我們婉詞說明以後，放聲大哭·全社同人，驚駭不己。同情心是任何人都有的，規章是我們所不願意破壞的。在這種情况之下，同人等就湊合些款子，在經過詳細考查以後，設法給這些小朋友們一點安慰，使他們能够上進。</p>
<p>就　高小部份來說，申請的有二千餘人。核准的一千餘人，我們敢担保，是請寒，是優秀。可是落選的小朋友們也並非不淸寒，不優秀，他們的落選實在都因爲款額限制。在此，有三種說法：　依敎育原理說，救濟兒童失學比救濟成人失學爲重要，成人失學尙可在家溫習，兒童失學則是「實足」的失學。　依國家社會的需要說，使將要成才的學生不致功虧一　，是最要的袖助。　就讀者助學的動機說，助學的意義在救急，不在救窮，雖帶慈善意義，而根本不是慈善事業，所以爲社會國家造就人才是最大的目的，因此對於立即可以替國家社會服務的在學生更爲注意。我們以往經過不少的商量，承蒙助學金委員會諸位先生的指示，定了一個數額的比例，適合各方面的意見。因爲多取了小學生，勢必减少了大中學生的名額，反之亦然·但是現在社會經濟的情况擺在眼前，小學生申請補助的人數是增加了，使我們對於今後的方針躊躇若，我們已經請求委員會諸位先生的意見，我們更願意接受讀者們的意見。</p>
<p>學費的增加，社會經濟的衰落，已經使六年小學敎育對於大多數的兒童成爲一件極困難的事情，這眞是嚴重問題！解决這樣一個大問題，非得政府的大力不可。我們因此重行提出我們所主張的國民義務敎育問題。現在事實上的需要更迫切了，上海的情形如此，共他各地的情形一定更不如上海，失學兒童的人數一定更數倍於上海·我們希望當局從速決定方針，至少先增加補助國民敎育的經費，嚴令小學的學費以後不許增加，進而謀全國兒意普過地有受敎育的機會，我們誠懇地仰望着！</p>

<h3>北京通訊　更歲聲中　生活緊張——財神捉弄囤虎——</h3>
<p>— 志仁</p>
<p>和歲月同時來的是經濟生活的緊張。年前年後是國虎們大活動的時期。這裏有成功，也有失敗·藍布是一直漲價漲到每疋一千六百元，現在却忽然落到五百元左右。金子是漲到二千四百元左右，現在却落到一千五百元。膠皮是漲到每付五百元左右，現在却落到三百元。曾經撫摸布疋，接吻金子，珍藏膠皮而暗地裏獨自狂笑的人們現在却噔着眼睛咒詛財神爺的搗鬼了。然而在另一方面，物價的飛漲仍在進行着，香油年前是每斤由八元漲到九元，現在却一躍而到達了十六元的關頭，而皮鞋商也在拒絕售賣存貨，使其漲價。街頭上很威風凜凜的是洋車夫·從東安市塲到西單可以昻着頭索價四元·不坐嗎？隨你的便。電車擠得不亦樂乎。前些時候，因爲車裏擠，常常遇到因爲無意中互相撞碰而起的爭鬥，現在是看不見爭鬥了，只是常常看到怒目相視，破口大駡的情形，擠得連轉動手足來打架的空問都沒有了，只容得眼珠和嘴唇有轉動的餘地。至於糧食，則小米麵也漲到每斤三元二角的程度，街頭倒斃的人也漸漸的多了起來。這是北京新春的姿態。（二月一日寄）</p>

<h3>盟邦佔領新加坡　今二週年紀念日　我國府當局發表重要感想</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　十五日為盟邦佔領新加坡二週年紀念，中央社記者特訪問國府當局，叩詢惑想，常承發表意見如左：溯自大東亞戰爭爆發，盟邦軍綠以其迅速行動，擊滅英國艦隊，使敵軍望風披廉。旋更佔領新加坡，摧毀英國侵略東亞之重要軍事政治經濟根據地，茲屆二週年紀念，吾人對盟邦將士之奮戰精神，誠不勝驚佩，回憶二年來，東亞局勢，就軍事言，盟邦佔領新加坡後，席捲荷印，直達所羅門羣島，西出緬甸，進迫印度邊境，東西陣綫，均建立世界戰事所未有之光榮戰績。就政治言，東亞民族獨立解放，接踵而起，緬甸菲律賓相繼獨立，印度自由政府成立，均展開東亞歷史所未有之光明一　。去年東亞各國舉行大東亞會護，發表宜言，披　信念·更證明東亞民族精誠團結，發揮十億民族總力之决意，以經濟言，則南方建設已有絕大把握，後方民需，亦有充分準備，以之應付戰爭，充分有餘。在敵人方面，則因南洋之喪失，資源陷於缺乏，一得一失，勝利誰屬，不言可喻。要之，不論軍事，政治，經濟，三方面，已步入絕對勝利之前程，最近敵侈言反攻，於南太平洋方面；作暴處憑河之舉，亦不過徒見其心勞日拙而已。惟敵人在未屈服以前，伺機蠢動，在所雖免，所望全體民衆，及東亞民族，並加努力奮戰，傾舉總方，向最後總决戰之途邁進，則敵人總崩潰之日，當在不遠也。</p>
<p>政府頒佈禁烟淸毒法案</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　今（十五日）爲盟邦佔領新加坡（現各昭南）之二周年紀念日。在此紀念日中，凡屬東亞人，凡屬中國人，皆在回溯英帝國主義者二三百年來，侵凌東亞，侵凌中國橫暴之罪惡。皆在追念大東亞戰爭以來，盟邦將士，衝鋒陷陣，不數日而破毀英美基本實力，不數月而傾麗英美最後根據地，英勇之戰績，皆在淬萬奮發，增進總力，以求完逐戰爭。頃據本社探悉，正在今日，我國政府禁烟淸毒法案，將由行政院　重審議，頒佈實施　事非偶然，實具有重大之時代意義。蓋鴉片之流　，為英帝國主義侵略之始，亦即應與英帝國主義在東亞之命運同其沒落。今於此日將有此决議，他禁烟淸毒，與攀滅英美雙重之意義，更爲明瞭。查當民國二十四年，注主席任行政院長任內，曾頒佈禁烟五年計劃，推行年餘，著有成效。此次法案即　續前議，更為嚴密，以求澈底實現者。記者曾　訪靑少年淸毒運動幹部，獲知靑少年對於此項消息，興常興奮，對於擁護政府，協力盟邦，對於禁烟淸毒，擊滅英美，益增其决心與勇氣。均在等待禁烟法案之公布，進而齊一步伐，强化組織，期以民衆與政府緊密配合之力量，貫澈淸毒運動，而毋負最高領袖倡導新運，救國救民之本旨·新國民運動促進委員會，為此事特應首都靑少年之請，定於本日下午五時，召集靑少年代表會議，函請內政部部畏，及中國靑少年團總監，兼中國靑年模範國書記長親蒞指示。聞屆時將由梅部長宣布禁烟實施辦法，由林總鹽指示今後淸毒運動方針云。</p>
<p>葉鮑兩長官特發表感想</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　我陸軍部葉部長，飽總參謀長，於十五日盟邦佔領新加坡二週年紀念日，均特發表惑言。　棄部長：英帝國號稱不拔的要塞新加坡，在我友　日本陸海空軍擊下了，　得異常脆弱無用。於大東亞戰爭揭幕後，為時僅爾月餘，即被攻佔。自然友軍將士之袖武，實值得敬佩無旣，但其眞實關鍵，却由於侵略者無道義為其基礎，任何堅强　築之廠大企圖，終究不值一擊。我東方王道精神，領導十億萬衆，將歷萬劫而不敗，豈僅大東亞戰爭之勝利而　哉。對於佔領新嘉坡二週年紀念日，除向友軍將士表示無限敬意外，並益堅定王者無敵之信念。　飽總參謀長，盟邦日本於三十年十二月八日，發動大東亞解放戰爭，不四日，便攻陷關島，將半月使佔領威克島及香港，兩個月零七日，便佔領新加坡，乃敵人百年來東亞海軍惟一堅固根據地，何以如此短短期日，便吿崩潰，便被佔領，至少有下列四種原因：　政冶方面，盟邦為解放東亞而戰，不僅造成本國人之總奮起，更其漲成東亞人之總團結。所以敵人敗　，盟邦勝利之出於意外的迅速。　戰略方面，敵人是驕暴成性，盟邦謹愼將事，寶在更得勝於妙算的戰略，　戰術方面，敵人戰術極形弛鈍，盟邦所以一舉登陸，使敵敗伏。　精神方面，敵人精神自始至終，頹廢不振，盟邦則精神異常旺盛。今天欣逢新加坡佔領二週年紀念之辰，實在講大東亞戰爭，我方終必獲完全勝利。</p>
<h3>日南方軍報道部　中島部長談話</h3>
<p>昭南十四日中央社電　日南方軍報道部長中島氏，以十五日為佔領新加坡二週年紀念日，特於十四日接見記者，發表談話，大意謂：新生馬來白誕生以來，迄今已二週年，回　過去，展望未來，惑概實深，前為英帝國侵略東亞基點之新加坡，今已成為防衛東亞之策源地補給地，同時各地原住民亦自英美荷之壓迫下。獲得解放而更生。南方軍政之</p>
<p>作戰第一</p>

<p>協力日軍</p>
<p>作戰，直至决勝而後已，甚至有參加義勇軍，為防衛鄉土而挺身者。日南方建設於日軍官民與當地住民共同努方下，已有顯著之進展，一般建築物及其他物品等，於敵人退却時，多被破壞。然於短期問內即行修復完畢，且各種工業亦在迅速復與，現在送往日本內地之資源及輸至第一綫之物資，亦均與日俱增。同時為完成現代戰爭上不可或缺之重要資源之開發，業已達到預期以上之優良成績，過去為英美殖民地之甫方，其產業上之特殊原料之生產及輸出，均受限制，然現在於各地已形成適地主義之工業化，故過去於英美統制下之舊制度，已完全破壞無遺。南方工業五年計劃，已日益强化。而能克服一切之困難條件，進行各方建設，戰時</p>

<h3>到德里去的路</h3>
<p>— 江特拉·鮑斯</p>
<p>完成了進攻德里的準備，進軍緬甸的印度臨時政府領袖飽斯氏，在印度獨立紀念的前一天——二十五日，親撰「到德里去的路」一文寄日本續　新聞社，聲明其突破一切障碍進攻德里的决意，茲迷譯其全文於后：</p>
<p>自古以來，德里成為所有往國外前來進攻印度的軍隊之决勝點。又為所有以印度為目的的印度軍隊之目標。事實上，在德里四周的印度大平原的石上，刻印着印度的歷史。實在說，芷如　又配德里者支配印度」一言所示，這裏實現在也深深地滲透在印度國民的胸中。以前，詩人們甚至　歌說：「德里的王者就是現世界的王者。一德里和道路四通八達的羅馬不同，西方常比西北方更為接近，道是歷史的教訓。一八五七年英國完全征服印度時，最充分利用了這教訓。最初英國為欲保他們在印度的帝國，　占領阿宮汗。但所有征服阿富汗的企圖，均歸失敗時，英國乃欲在阿笞汗與印度之間，第起一道防壁。</p>
<p>英國的策略</p>
<p>英國是常在本能上相信宣傳的價值之國家。即在最近，英國也以新加坡是百攻不克的要塞之印象，給與全世界。與此同樣，更宣傳說印度西北國境的要塞的堅不可拔的。可是印度，阿富汗國境雖較為要塞化，但從波斯方面通貝爾其斯坦的路，很容易受到攻擊。然而波斯在軍上是很弱的，所以英國並無什麽危險，所　者，綠聯隨時或許從阿　汗攻擊印度。因此，英國所有的防塞，其主力均守護印度，阿富汗國境，以對付從西北來的侵人軍。其結果，一九一九年以後許多印度革命家，逃至加勃爾，向莫斯科求助。阿　努拉王知道西北印度的防衛絕對不落的話不過是傳說·因此，英印政府及阿富汗之間引起糾紛時，王即毫不　　的突入戰爭狀態，一九一九年，阿富汗軍侵入印度，英國大起恐慌，由於阿富汗王所提的條件，而與王　和。</p>
<p>帝俄張盛時，在印度的英國人，不斷的恐　俄國從阿富汗侵入。沙皇敵權　潰後，他們方才放心。但一九一七年在莫斯科樹立的共產政權，對亞洲全體的奴隸民族表示同情；而對印度獨立表示同情的阿瑪努拉王，一九一九年就阿富汗王位；此等事情，使印度革命家發生了阿富汗或許從共產主義的俄國獲得援助的希望，而增加了不少力量。然而十年後，英國用計從該國放逐阿瑪努拉王。這樣，一九二九年在英國等於是蘇生的一年。十年之後，情勢又一變，同年八月的德蘇不侵犯條約，同年九月德英戰爭的勃發，又　使英國陷於對蘇恐怖的夢覺中。在阻止蘇聯軍侵入的企圖下，再着手强化印度西北國境的防衛。</p>
<p>昭和十六年（一九四一）六月突然勃發的德蘇戰，挽救了極狼狽的英國人民。德軍的閃電進出於高加索方面，雖暫時擔心或將到伊朗方面，但結果，他們感到了德蘇戰的勃發，挽救了印度內的英帝國。然而大東亞戰一旦勃發後，一切情形均告急變，印度西北國境一時失却，其楞史的意義，而緬印國境代之為注目之的。中緬印國境險阻的山脈，　荒未闢的　林，卒變成可能通過的地方，駐緬英國總督及其手下狼狽的英軍，越過羣山，沿着新開拓的道路，逃至孟加拉州，更逃至德里。前駐緬英國總督現卜居於新德里，與其從緬甸逃亡的部下共圖蠢動。但他們從緬甸逃亡到印度時，留下了道路供我們的同志使用。他門從仰光到德里去以後，他們所通過的道路，又被我們同志開拓了，這道路現在等待着我印度國民軍進　。這樣，從西北部到印度的進路，完全一變，從緬甸的進攻印度路，成爲新的問題了。</p>
<p>進攻德里的路綫</p>
<p>今日　開在我們眼前的到德里的路，不計其數，且這些路爲我們的最捷徑而有效的打進攻路。在歐洲有這句話：「一切路都通羅馬」，在這里東亞，陸上一切的路都通印度的首都，通那靜眼中的古老而赤色的城塞。德里是我們所指望的目的地。我們將經過這路而進攻德里。在我們前進的路上，雖說有許多從山密林，但沒有　設在西北國境一樣的阻止我們進攻的要塞，那是新聞拓的路，大自然成爲我們的友人。我們現在獲得了毫無困難，越過這天惠的障礙之力塲。從緬甸到德里，到總督官邸，到君臨全印的赤色城塞。我們前進的路是漫長的，困頓的，但機會已經成熟了。不要失掉一刻的時機。迅速進擊。「到德里去的路」！「到解放的路」！（翔：譯自一月二十七日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>緬印敵空軍　已遭遇危機　渝方言論益表不滿</h3>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　渝方言論界，　於緬印戰錢反軸心空軍已遭危機，故對英國益表不滿態度，十一日各報之社論，均對曼特巴　之無力，表示加刻之失望，並率直承認日軍已　　戰局之主導性。對於反軸心軍所演之阿拉坎悲劇第二幕，顯示暗澹憂盧之色。渝方軍事委員會之機關報「掃蕩報」，已放棄從來之樂觀論調，而作悲觀之論評。謂曼特巴顛麾下之英印軍，為奪回緬甸而取積極攻勢。但過去數月之賣情，已證明此種攻勢完全與預料相反，尤以近數日來阿拉坎戰綫之情勢，已證實日軍掌握戰局之主導性。不久于乾季過後，曼特巴顚將無所期望，恐將給與日軍決定攻防兩樣作戰時間之餘裕。又大公報力言日本之强大戰力，以警告英美方面，並謂失敗原因屬於英美方面云。日軍現已獲得對印度展開大攻勢之絕好機會，且駐印英軍似完全不適宜於實戰。觀日本航空機生產力之急激增强，即可知日軍現已可自由防衛作戰基地。且日本此後可繼續十年或二十年之戰鬥，此非僅爲日軍之誇大宣傳，如是問題即在英美兩國方面，英美兩國　可轉換其外交政策，而繼續十年戰爭否？英美雨國內孤立主義或妥協派很勢時而使戰爭中途遭受挫折否？美國及渝方以最近之馬紹爾羣島作戰，此種軍事行動；巳抱打倒日本之决心否？又英國之行動如何’如是我等對於曼特已顛，自受任東南亞軍司令官以來，究從事何事，不得不抱懷疑。此極新聞論調發表後，駐重慶英美新聞記者團至感驚　，是日於軍事委員會會見記者時，有質問此項言論，是否即代表渝當局之意見，使渝軍事發言人極難置答云。</p>

<h3>淮海省通貨　趨於一元化</h3>
<p>中儲徐支行將開幕</p>
<p>徐州十四日中央社電　中儲券自去年十二月一日起，於本地區與聯銀倂用後，民間使用極爲便利。淮海省當局爲促進儲券在淮海省內普遍流通，幷將前所規定值兩劵兌換在千元以上時，須具明兌換理由辦法，以及匯兌上之限制，自六日起均予廢除。同時中儲徐州支行，預定於本月二十日開幕。由於通貨一元化之實現期近，　聯物價低落與民生安定甚鉅，故一般對之異常注視與期待。記者爲此昨特走訪各關係機關，據表示淮海省政府既已成立，地方通貨之調整，實爲必要。況目前物價上漲，民衆生活，均感不安，儲幣行使之進一步擴展，尤地方上行使，因銀行尙未設置，故流通數額較少，不　應用。現既將與聯銀兌換限制辦法　　，支行亦開幕有期，儲幣前途，自然可期。隨之當局經濟施策，一般　望之物價低減，亦均可順利　成。今後關於物價，當使各商店必須一律表明儲幣價格　與聯幣　　。惟商店方面將來難免有取巧之處，負寶當局隨時嚴予以取締。</p>

<h3>提議敎员薪水　半年一次付给</h3>
<p>— 唐敬果</p>
<p>現在生活程　日益高漲，最受嚴重影響的是教員。因為學校底學費於開學時一次收足，而敎員底薪水，則是依開畢時生活指數規定，而於半年中遂月支付的，這半年之中，生活程假定是增加一倍，那教員底薪水等於打了一個對折，一百只當五十元用了；生活程度假定增加兩倍，三倍，四倍，教員底薪水實質上更依次　折。到那時教員怎能拿薪水來維持生活呢？</p>
<p>所以我主張學校當局和教員之間，應該開誠布公，商討一個兩不吃　的辦法來。最好於這開學時期，即將教員半年中應得的薪水，一次付給教員，由教員自行及早安排半年中底生活需要。如果學校當局不能信任教員，惟恐教員拿到了窈水之後，不肯用心教授，那不妨用一個連環保的辦法，在支付薪水時，呌教員們互相連環保證。或者先付一半薪水，其餘一半薪水則購買實物，由學校黨別局保存，於三個月後逐月付給。這</p>
<h3>如何解決書荒</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自報紙令價猛漲後，各種書籍報張定價亦隨着上漲不巳，而蒙受影嚮最大的耍算各種教科書了，每逢開學時，必自　漲上數憤，往往買了一本書，翻開首頁或末頁尚印着上學期時的價目，可見决不是新書，而是存貨無疑。薄薄的一本中小學的國定教科書須十數元，數十元一本，而大學課本的書價更令人昨舌，去年一百元一冊的，今年非四五百元不買，更有跑遍書肆買不到書之苦，往舊書攤去買舊的，更是難了，恐怕比新書價更貴，外行的人一定上當，並且熟門的書十有入九藏着不買，因此一個問題，不但是學校當局和教員問底切身問題，並且是整個社會關於子女教　的嚴重問題。為什麼呢？是因為日後生活程度高漲，至於教員不能拿規定的薪水維持生活時，教員不能楊腹任教。那子弟們不是耍陷於失學的困境麼？</p>
<p>所以這個問題，不但學校常局和教員本身要開誠地加以公平妥善的解决；便是整個社會人士，也必须为子女底敎育著想，督促他們兩方底實行才是學期的學費再加上不小的書籍費，學生的家長實不堪負擔。</p>
<p>查究其書價猛漲的原因，報紙存量日少的影響固其一因，但直接的原因，就是近來一輩書賈，利懇熏心，把教科　也當一般商品囤積起來，居奇不買，欲待善價而沽。而最可恨，最可怕的現象，就是發現有幾個號稱最高知識陌級的大學教授，也在利用着這便利熟饑的機會，私藏着大批大學用書，幹起市儈的勾當來，這淸形，對於上海的教育前一，眞是不堪設想了。如今開學在即，消極的解决書荒問題，乃是當今急務，現僅就大學方而述之：</p>
<p>理化方面，可由學生抄筆記，而不必限定購何書，即無書也不妨學生自然會向各方面去找參考的。</p>
<p>英文往往厚厚的一冊書，一學期僅講授了寥寥數頁，即棄而不讀，又需另買他書，實不合節約與「物盡其利」的原則，更不必硬令學生須購買最新版的英文書，徒使書店賺錢而已。因為英文不此現化等科學書新舊版內容或有大不同，紙多增減一些材料篇輻，今建議請英文教授於書本內撰出幾篇精華來印就講義，發給學生像活葉文選然，豈不又替學生省了一筆錢。</p>
<p>歷史也可抄筆記，什麼迪史一類的書，其價錢　不是學生所能買得起。</p>
<p>學校圖書館應多購各科參考書，並且每種更應多備幾部，以使流通，而圖書　主任更應嚴格營理，往往某一部書借出後，第二人往往不復再能借到，學生固不能視公共書籍為私有，而敎授亦不能擅佔，以妨　流通。</p>

<p>償人是有生以來第一次驚中於「唱歇」的，所以進步也很快。就是沒有軍樂緻以後，從著上級學生的指導開始總習校歌的時候，也沒忘却正確的唱法。只有一處，不知是甚麼緣故，總要將詞句弄錯了的。就是將「我等再不榭勵一唱作」我等再不奮起」的。</p>
<p>（我等再不奮起！）　人到入方園去的時候，戚在降落取艦旗的嚴肅的瞬間，在他的　海中，也要想起這個句子的。</p>
<p>（不是奮起，是奮勵啊！）剛這樣地想起來，間時又就要忘掉了。</p>
<p>在快活的就寢十五分間的談天後，就寢的喇叭　了，學生們都閉上了嘴，開始睡覺的時候，俱人也瑩將手放在胸上，好　信者似的默禱着。（我等再不奮起！）</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>不得意的軍歌，好容易克服了。但是游泳鑪一門却不會進步得那麼快，所以眞人被剔出級外的紅帽子班裹去了。</p>
<p>暑期的日課，是早最的體育時間和游泳時間。角力在着期也很盛行，但是這也和游泳一樣，不只是一種運動，而是訓練，算分數的。</p>
<p>眞人對游泳，最少限度，也希望作一個有等級的。有時候從三號學生聽到跳水是進級的標準，從那以後，就每天專門的練習跳水。早晨日課時間不必說，在午後有志者們的練習時間，也一定要到跳板上去。白的胸膛，被水衡擊着，好像撒上葡萄酒似的發紅。但是他依　皮復地往水裹跳着。在行為上間小野道風的靑蛙雖然相反，而精神上却頗可以伯仲。</p>
<p>「粗書地，而有毅力的小子！」游泳的教官，看到　人練習的這種淸形—對在身旁的一號學「　而姿勢太壞。好像海　掉到池十裏時的樣子，像那樣是要培染胸膛的。」「告訴他注意吧？」「不用管，隨他使好了，像那樣的有毅力，自然自己就會好的。」</p>
<p>從那時起，　人的特微，逐漸被周圍的人注意起來了。小的身裁，白的面孔，時常要嬉嬉地笑着，將來要做海軍士官，實在是有點不可靠，並且　酒店也不去，好像是軍人愛財似的態度，都以輕　的目光看待他，但是對他這種異常的榭鬥精神，不得不變更他們的這種錯誤的認識。</p>
<p>為甚麼呢？因為沒有比道個學校再重視「奮鬥精神」的。廣瀨中佐在學的期間，登過古鷹山三百多次，切尊敬都集於身，直到現在，在學生中間，仍傳為佳話的。</p>
<p>然而俱人的這種奮鬥精神，並不是天生的性格。並且他自己也知道這是從少年時代以來的，不服輸的心理，易熱而也易凉的薩糜人的生性，在自己的血管中也流着。在校內的縣人會，也時常的義論着，他不過是因為自己沒有毅力，所以要繼續地努力着。所以他道種奮鬥，是極不自然的。有時候過火的地方也很多</p>
<p>他對柔術和角力，有相當的自信，而槍術和劍術，是極其軟弱的。所以　骨地發揮着他那奮鬥的精神。就使被狙擊着了，他也不懦怯，拼侖不斷地狙擊著對方。「谷……你有點太也不知趣了。」他的對方終於要這樣地憤慨着。</p>

<h3>Assisting Education and National Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>In handling this year's student aid fund, we discovered something different from previous years, namely the large number of elementary school students applying. It has already been reported that over 700 former students and over 800 new students have been approved. Over 100 former students were rejected due to poor grades, and nearly 1,000 new students were rejected due to poor grades. In total, over 2,000 elementary school students applied for assistance. We further considered that even more elementary school students applied to other national institutions, and some out-of-school elementary school students did not even request assistance. By rough estimate, there are at least over 10,000 out-of-school children in Shanghai alone. This is truly a major issue!</p>
<p>Entrusted with a great responsibility by our readers, we handle student aid affairs with the firm belief that "donations are the readers' hard-earned money, and we must repay them with our hard-earned work." We have established the standard of "poor but outstanding," strictly adhering to it without any compromise. Outsiders may think it is too strict, but we feel that only in this way can we be worthy of our readers. Around the end of the year and beginning of the new year, when people are celebrating, our colleagues and many of the gentlemen who sponsor us are buried in application forms, registration forms, transcripts, family situation investigation reports, graded lists, grouped exams, and other forms, working day and night. Here, we find more interesting pleasure than watching a play or eating a meal, and we gain unparalleled comfort in spirit. We have done these small tasks for the readers of the *Shen Bao*, but the readers of the *Shen Bao* have pulled the Republic of China forward a few more steps.</p>
<p>Regarding the elementary school portion, from the beginning, we stipulated that it would be limited to higher elementary school students. There were two intentions: first, the tuition for lower elementary school is relatively lighter; second, four years of lower elementary education should, in any case, be the responsibility of the children's parents and relatives. However, the current situation is different. The increase in tuition for lower elementary school has reached a point where not everyone can afford it. When registering applications this year, many lower elementary school students came to the office accompanied by their elderly parents, and burst into tears after we explained the situation tactfully. All of our colleagues were shocked. Everyone has compassion, and we are unwilling to break the rules. In this situation, our colleagues pooled some money and, after careful investigation, tried to give these children some comfort so that they could make progress.</p>
<p>As for the higher elementary school portion, over 2,000 people applied. We guarantee that the over 1,000 people approved are poor and outstanding. However, the children who were rejected are not necessarily not poor or not outstanding. Their rejection was truly due to the limitation of funds. Here, there are three viewpoints: according to educational principles, it is more important to help children who are out of school than to help adults who are out of school. Adults who are out of school can still review at home, while children who are out of school are truly "completely" out of school. According to the needs of the nation and society, it is most important to help students who are about to become talented so that they do not give up halfway. According to the motive of readers providing student aid, the meaning of student aid lies in helping in times of urgent need, not in helping the poor. Although it has charitable implications, it is not fundamentally a charitable undertaking. Therefore, the greatest purpose is to cultivate talent for society and the nation, and thus more attention is paid to students who can immediately serve the nation and society. We have had many discussions in the past, and with the guidance of the gentlemen on the Student Aid Fund Committee, we have set a proportion that suits all aspects of the opinions. Because more elementary school students are taken, the number of middle school and university students will inevitably be reduced, and vice versa. However, the current social and economic situation is before us, and the number of elementary school students applying for assistance has increased, which makes us hesitant about the future direction. We have already sought the opinions of the gentlemen on the committee, and we are even more willing to accept the opinions of our readers.</p>
<p>The increase in tuition and the decline of the social economy have made six years of elementary school education extremely difficult for the majority of children. This is truly a serious problem! To solve such a big problem, the government's great effort is indispensable. Therefore, we reiterate our proposed national compulsory education issue. The actual need is even more urgent now. The situation in Shanghai is like this, and the situation in other places must be even worse than Shanghai. The number of out-of-school children must be several times greater than in Shanghai. We hope that the authorities will quickly decide on a direction, at least first increasing the funding for national education, strictly ordering that elementary school tuition not be increased in the future, and further striving to ensure that children throughout the country have the opportunity to receive education. We earnestly look forward to it!</p>

<h3>Beijing Correspondence: Tensions Amidst the New Year's Greetings - The God of Wealth Teases the Hoarders -</h3>
<p>— Zhiren</p>
<p>Along with the passage of time comes the tension of economic life. The period around the New Year is a time of great activity for the hoarders. There are successes and failures. Blue cloth had been rising in price all along to 1,600 yuan per bolt, but now it has suddenly dropped to around 500 yuan. Gold had risen to around 2,400 yuan, but now it has dropped to 1,500 yuan. Rubber tires had risen to around 500 yuan per pair, but now they have dropped to 300 yuan. The people who once stroked the cloth, kissed the gold, treasured the rubber tires, and secretly laughed to themselves are now glaring and cursing the God of Wealth for playing tricks. However, on the other hand, the soaring of prices continues. Sesame oil rose from 8 yuan to 9 yuan per catty before the New Year, but now it has jumped to the 16 yuan mark, and shoe merchants are also refusing to sell their stock in order to raise prices. The rickshaw pullers are very imposing on the streets. It costs 4 yuan to go from Dong'an Market to Xidan. Don't want to ride? Suit yourself. The trams are packed to the gills. Some time ago, because the trams were crowded, there were often quarrels caused by accidental bumps, but now there are no more quarrels, only glares and curses, as there is no space to even move one's limbs to fight, only the eyeballs and lips have room to move. As for food, millet flour has also risen to 3.20 yuan per catty, and the number of people collapsing on the streets is gradually increasing. This is the appearance of Beijing in the New Year.

<h3>Allied Occupation of Singapore, Second Anniversary Today, Our Government Authorities Issue Important Reflections</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) The 15th marks the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore. A Central News Agency reporter visited government authorities to inquire about their thoughts. They agreed to publish the following opinions: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Allied forces have used their rapid action to defeat the British fleet, causing the enemy forces to lose courage. They then occupied Singapore, destroying an important military, political, and economic base of British aggression in East Asia. On the occasion of the second anniversary, we cannot help but admire the fighting spirit of the Allied soldiers. Recalling the past two years, in terms of military affairs, after the Allied occupation of Singapore, they swept through the Dutch East Indies, reaching the Solomon Islands, went west to Burma, and approached the Indian border. Both the eastern and western fronts established glorious war achievements unprecedented in world war history. In terms of politics, the independence and liberation of East Asian nations have risen one after another. Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and the Free India Government has been established, all unfolding a bright new page in East Asian history. Last year, East Asian countries held the Greater East Asia Conference, issued a declaration, and expressed their beliefs. This further proved the determination of East Asian nations to unite sincerely and exert the total strength of one billion people. In terms of economics, the Southern Development has been largely grasped, and there is ample preparation for the needs of the rear, which is more than sufficient to cope with the war. On the enemy's side, due to the loss of Southeast Asia, resources are scarce. One gain and one loss, the winner is self-evident. In short, in terms of military, political, and economic aspects, we have entered the path of absolute victory. Recently, the enemy has extravagantly mentioned a counteroffensive in the South Pacific; their reckless actions are merely seeing their efforts exhausted. However, before the enemy surrenders, they will seize the opportunity to move in a foolish manner, which is inevitable. It is hoped that all the people and East Asian nations will work hard and strive to push towards the final general battle, and the day of the enemy's total collapse will not be far away.</p>
<h3>The Government Promulgates the Anti-Smoking and Detoxification Law</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Today (the 15th) is the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore (now known as Shonan). On this anniversary, all East Asians and all Chinese people are recalling the crimes of the British imperialists who have invaded and oppressed East Asia and China for two or three hundred years. All are recalling the brave battles of the Allied soldiers since the Greater East Asia War, who charged into battle and destroyed the basic strength of Britain and America in a few days, and demolished the final base of Britain and America in a few months. Their heroic achievements are all urging us to strive forward, increase our total strength, and seek to complete the war. It is learned from this agency that the government's anti-smoking and detoxification bill will be reviewed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan today, which is no accident and has great significance for the times. The spread of opium was the beginning of British imperialist aggression, and it should share the same fate as British imperialism in East Asia. Today's resolution on anti-smoking and detoxification has the dual meaning of destroying both opium and Britain and America, which is even clearer. It is found that in the 24th year of the Republic, while Chairman Wang served as the President of the Executive Yuan, he promulgated a five-year anti-smoking plan, which was implemented for more than a year and achieved results. This bill will continue the previous plan and be more stringent in order to achieve thorough implementation. This reporter interviewed cadres of the youth detoxification movement and learned that the youth were very excited about this news and were more determined and courageous to support the government, cooperate with the Allies, and eliminate smoking and detoxify, destroying Britain and America. All are awaiting the promulgation of the anti-smoking law and are moving forward in unison, strengthening their organization, and hoping to use the combined power of the people and the government to implement the detoxification movement, and not to let down the original intention of the supreme leader to promote the new movement and save the country and the people. At the request of the youth of the capital, the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee has scheduled a meeting of youth representatives at 5:00 PM today and has sent letters to the Minister of the Interior and the Director of the Chinese Youth League and Secretary-General of the Chinese Youth Model Regiment to personally provide guidance. It is said that Minister Mei will announce the implementation measures for anti-smoking, and General Lin will instruct on the future direction of the detoxification movement.</p>
<h3>Chiefs Ye and Bao Specially Express Thoughts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Minister Ye of the Army and Chief of Staff Bao specially expressed their thoughts on the second anniversary of the Allied occupation of Singapore on the 15th. Minister Ye said: "The supposedly impregnable fortress of Singapore was taken down by our friendly Japanese army, navy, and air force, showing it to be unusually fragile and useless. It was occupied only two months after the opening of the Greater East Asia War. Naturally, the bravery of the friendly soldiers deserves admiration, but the real key is that the aggressors had no righteousness as their foundation, and any strong construction of a great endeavor is ultimately not worth a blow. Our Eastern spirit of kingship leads a billion people and will never be defeated even after ten thousand tribulations. This is not only the victory of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, in addition to expressing infinite respect to the friendly soldiers, we are more determined in our belief that the king is invincible." Chief of Staff Bao said that on December 8th of the 30th year, our ally Japan launched the Greater East Asia Liberation War. In just four days, it captured Guam; in half a month, it occupied Wake Island and Hong Kong; and in two months and seven days, it occupied Singapore, the enemy's only solid naval base in East Asia for a hundred years. Why did it collapse and be occupied in such a short period? There are at least the following four reasons: In terms of politics, the Allied forces fought to liberate East Asia, not only causing the total rise of the people of our country but also the total unity of the East Asians. Therefore, the enemy's defeat and the Allied victory came unexpectedly quickly. In terms of strategy, the enemy was arrogant by nature, while the Allies were cautious and were victorious due to their brilliant strategy. In terms of tactics, the enemy's tactics were extremely slow, while the Allies were able to land in one fell swoop, causing the enemy to be defeated. In terms of spirit, the enemy's spirit was decadent and depressed from beginning to end, while the Allied spirit was unusually vigorous. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, it is certain that our side will achieve complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Mr. Nakajima, Director of the Southern Army Press Department, Speaks</h3>
<p>Shonan, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Mr. Nakajima, Director of the Southern Army Press Department, gave an interview to reporters on the 14th, with the 15th being the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, and made a speech, the general idea of which was: "Two years have passed since the birth of the new Malaya. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, the thoughts are indeed deep. Singapore, formerly the base point for British imperialism to invade East Asia, has now become the source of defense and supply for East Asia. At the same time, the natives of various places have also been liberated from the oppression of Britain, America, and the Netherlands and have been reborn. The Southern Army's political First</p>
<p>Operational</p>
<p>Principle is also steadily advancing, aiming to exhaust the total strength within the Southern Sphere to defeat Britain and America, and moving towards the path of completing the war. To adapt to local conditions, drastic and appropriate measures are being implemented. The natives of various places have also actively cooperated, which has achieved practical results. The various places in the South have become a part of Greater East Asia, eliminating British and American forces, breaking the old order, and working hand in hand with Asian countries towards the goal of building a grand new Greater East Asia order. Furthermore, Southern construction has a great connection to completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the development of the Southern military and government shoulders an extremely important mission. Due to the progress of various measures, the residents of various places are increasingly aware of their mission. The residents of Malaya, Java, Sumatra, and other Southern regions are all able to understand the true meaning of this war, and with a determination to win,</p>
<p>Cooperate with the Japanese Army</p>
<p>in combat until victory is achieved. There are even those who have joined the volunteer army to defend their homeland. With the joint efforts of Japanese military and civilians and local residents, the Southern construction of Japan has made remarkable progress. Most buildings and other items were destroyed when the enemy retreated. However, they were repaired completely within a short period of time, and various industries are also rapidly recovering. The resources currently sent to the Japanese mainland and the supplies transported to the front lines are also increasing daily. At the same time, the development of important resources that are indispensable for modern warfare has achieved excellent results beyond expectations. In the past, as British and American colonies, the production and export of special raw materials in their industries were restricted. However, now, industries that are suitable for local conditions have been formed in various places. Therefore, the old system under British and American control has been completely destroyed. The Southern Industrial Five-Year Plan is being strengthened daily and can overcome all difficult conditions. Promoting construction in all aspects during wartime</p>
<p>Construction Promotion</p>
<p>will make the Southern regions self-sufficient industrial supply bases. Shipbuilding industry has made great progress in various parts of the South. Therefore, the transportation of important materials from the South to the mainland and the promotion of material exchanges have made Southern resources a fighting force, which has made a great contribution to completing the operation. Regarding the food self-sufficiency system, past malpractices have been eliminated. The increase in food production is currently being promoted. In Malaya, rice imports have been reduced to a fraction of what they were before the war, and overseas Chinese have taken the lead in participating in food production increases. From this, after the occupation of Singapore, the construction under the Southern Sphere's First Operational Principle has made considerable progress. Its construction will be further strengthened in the future, and its contribution to the strengthening of combat power will be enormous. Today, the Southern construction battle is a military battle, and it is a part of the military battle. At the same time, it is also</p>
<p>Striving for Victory</p>
<p>a military factory. In order to win the war, there is no difference between the front and the rear. Every citizen must exert all their abilities, contributing money if they have money, and contributing strength if they have strength. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the occupation of Singapore, this phenomenon has been clearly manifested, which is the current situation on the front line of the South.</p>
<h3>The Road to Delhi</h3>
<p>— Chandra Bose</p>
<p>Having completed preparations for attacking Delhi, Mr. Bose, leader of the Indian Provisional Government advancing into Burma, personally wrote "The Road to Delhi" and sent it to the Japanese Shimbun Rengosha the day before India's Independence Day—the 25th—declaring his determination to break through all obstacles and attack Delhi. The full text is translated below:</p>
<p>Since ancient times, Delhi has been the decisive point for all armies coming from abroad to attack India, and the target of all Indian armies aiming for India. In fact, the history of India is engraved on the stones of the great Indian plains around Delhi. Indeed, as the saying "He who controls Delhi controls India" shows, this is deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Indian people. In the past, poets even sang, "The ruler of Delhi is the ruler of the present world." Unlike Rome, where all roads lead, the West is often closer than the Northwest, a lesson of history. In 1857, when Britain completely conquered India, it made full use of this lesson. Initially, Britain wanted to protect its empire in India by occupying Afghanistan. But when all attempts to conquer Afghanistan failed, Britain wanted to build a barrier between Afghanistan and India.</p>
<p>British Strategy</p>
<p>Britain is a country that has always instinctively believed in the value of propaganda. Even recently, Britain gave the world the impression that Singapore was an impregnable fortress. Similarly, it was also propagated that the fortresses on the northwestern border of India were indestructible. However, although the border between India and Afghanistan is more fortified, the road through Balochistan from Persia is easily attacked. However, Persia is militarily weak, so Britain is not in much danger. What [they] fear is that the Soviet Union might attack India from Afghanistan at any time. Therefore, the main force of all British defenses guarded the border between India and Afghanistan to deal with invaders from the Northwest. As a result, after 1919, many Indian revolutionaries fled to Kabul to seek help from Moscow. King Amanullah knew that the defense of northwestern India was just a myth. Therefore, when a dispute arose between the British Indian government and Afghanistan, the King immediately and unexpectedly launched a state of war. In 1919, the Afghan army invaded India, causing great panic in Britain. Because of the conditions proposed by the Afghan King, [Britain] made peace with him.</p>
<p>When Tsarist Russia was at its peak, the British in India constantly feared that Russia would invade from Afghanistan. They were only relieved after the collapse of the Tsarist regime. However, the communist regime established in Moscow in 1917 expressed sympathy for all enslaved peoples in Asia; and King Amanullah, who expressed sympathy for Indian independence, ascended the throne of Afghanistan in 1919. These events gave Indian revolutionaries hope that Afghanistan might receive assistance from communist Russia, and increased their strength considerably. However, ten years later, Britain used a trick to exile King Amanullah from the country. In this way, 1929 was like a year of resurrection for Britain. Ten years later, the situation changed again. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August of the same year, and the outbreak of the German-British war in September of the same year, plunged Britain back into a nightmare of fear of the Soviet Union. In an attempt to prevent the invasion of the Soviet army, [Britain] began to strengthen the defenses of the northwestern border of India again.</p>
<p>The sudden outbreak of the German-Soviet war in June 1941 saved the extremely embarrassed British people. Although the rapid advance of the German army into the Caucasus region temporarily worried [them] about reaching the Iranian region, in the end, they felt that the outbreak of the German-Soviet war saved the British Empire in India. However, once the Greater East Asia War broke out, all situations changed drastically. The northwestern border of India temporarily lost its historical significance, and the border between Burma and India became the focus of attention. The treacherous mountain range on the border between China, Burma, and India, the undeveloped jungle, eventually became a passable place. The British Governor-General of Burma and his embarrassed British army crossed the mountains, along newly opened roads, and fled to Bengal, and then to Delhi. The former British Governor-General of Burma is now living in New Delhi, plotting mischief with his subordinates who fled from Burma. But when they fled from Burma to India, they left roads for our comrades to use. After they went from Rangoon to Delhi, the roads they passed through were also opened up by our comrades. These roads are now awaiting the advance of our Indian National Army. In this way, the route to India from the Northwest has completely changed, and the road to attack India from Burma has become a new problem.</p>
<p>The Route to Attack Delhi</p>
<p>Today, countless roads to Delhi are open before our eyes, and these roads are the shortest and most effective routes for us to attack. In Europe, there is a saying: "All roads lead to Rome." Here in East Asia, all roads on land lead to the capital of India, to that ancient and red fortress in [our] steady gaze. Delhi is our desired destination. We will attack Delhi by this road. Although there are many mountains and dense forests on our way forward, there are no fortresses like those set up on the northwestern border to prevent our attack. That is a newly opened road, and nature has become our friend. We have now gained the power to overcome this heaven-sent obstacle effortlessly. From Burma to Delhi, to the Governor-General's residence, to the Red Fort that reigns over all of India. Our road ahead is long and difficult, but the opportunity has ripened. Do not miss a moment. Strike quickly. "The Road to Delhi"! "The Road to Liberation"! (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, January 27th, by Xiang)</p>
<h3>The Enemy Air Force in Burma and India is Facing a Crisis. The Chongqing Commentary Shows Increased Dissatisfaction.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The Chongqing commentary circles believe that the anti-Axis air force on the Burmese-Indian front is facing a crisis. Therefore, they are increasingly dissatisfied with Britain. The editorials of various newspapers on the 11th expressed increased disappointment with the powerlessness of Imphal, and frankly admitted that the Japanese army has already taken the lead in the war. The second act of the Arakan tragedy, staged by the anti-Axis forces, shows a dim and worrisome color. The organ newspaper "Sao Dang Bao" of the Chongqing Military Commission has abandoned its usual optimistic tone and made a pessimistic commentary. It said that the British and Indian armies under Imphal are taking an active offensive to recapture Burma. However, the sale of love over the past few months has proved that this offensive is completely contrary to expectations. In particular, the situation on the Arakan front in recent days has confirmed that the Japanese army has grasped the leading role in the war. Soon after the dry season, Imphal will have nothing to expect, and it is feared that it will give the Japanese army the opportunity to decide on both offensive and defensive operations. Ta Kung Pao also strongly stated the powerful combat power of Japan to warn the British and American sides, and said that the reason for the failure belongs to the British and American sides. The Japanese army has now obtained an excellent opportunity to launch a major offensive against India, and the British army stationed in India seems completely unsuitable for actual combat. Looking at the rapid increase in the productivity of Japanese aircraft, it can be seen that the Japanese army can now freely defend its operational bases. Moreover, Japan can continue to fight for ten or twenty years. This is not just exaggerated propaganda by the Japanese army. The question is whether the United Kingdom and the United States can change their foreign policies and continue the ten-year war? Will isolationism or appeasement factions in the United Kingdom and the United States repeatedly cause setbacks in the war? The United States and Chongqing have recently taken military action in the Marshall Islands; Has it embraced the determination to defeat Japan? Also, what is the action of the United Kingdom? If so, we cannot help but be suspicious of what Imphal has been doing since he was appointed commander of the Southeast Asian Army. After this extremely news-worthy comment was published, the British and American journalist corps stationed in Chongqing was greatly surprised. On the same day, when meeting reporters at the Military Commission, someone questioned whether this comment represented the opinion of the Chongqing authorities, making it extremely difficult for the Chongqing military spokesperson to answer.</p>

It is hereby ordered that you follow the instructions and comply. In the future, if any cases of indiscriminate detention are discovered, they will be immediately transferred for disciplinary action. Officials who are negligent in supervision will also be held accountable. You must all comply.</p>

<h3>Minister Zhang Orders Subordinates to Practice Thrift and Integrity</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Dispatch) In order to adapt to the wartime system and promote thrift, and to promote judicial dignity and practice integrity, Zhang Yipeng, Minister of Judicial Administration, specifically ordered all judicial officials at all levels to eliminate entertainment, prohibit accepting gifts, and be as thrifty as possible in daily life, and to be vigilant in order to complete the wartime judicial spirit. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Investigating judicial officials, the place is dignified, and the pursuit of wandering is prohibited. At this time of rising prices, the cost of a meal is often thousands. How can the law be cheap and clean? It must be known that more one point of expenses is one less point of integrity. Although the cause is small, the matter is huge. In the future, in addition to the necessary entertainment, the heads of the various prisons should comply with the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Civil Servant Banquets and Gift Restrictions promulgated by the National Government on December 15, 32nd year of the Republic [1943], and all other subordinates should absolutely prohibit entertainment and prohibit gifts. If there are weddings or funerals among colleagues, the court's prison shall determine the minimum limit, send cash together, and tear them apart separately, and must not send them privately individually. The income of the officials is only enough to make a living. In this difficult time, daily life should be as thrifty as possible. If they still go to the wine poverty exchange, the entertainment powder, not only waste time, but also fear that the cost will increase. Although they guarantee not to drink until they are exhausted, they will eventually step into the criminal law, and there is no regret in chasing. Thinking of this, how can they not be awe-inspiring. All my colleagues should each understand the situation and be vigilant, and if they still resist, they will be punished. All officials should set an example and conduct a thorough investigation without slight favoritism. It is ordered to comply and to inform all subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3>Huaihai Province Currency Trending Towards Unification</h3>
<p>Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch to Open</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Since the Central Reserve Bank notes were used in conjunction with the United Reserve Bank notes in this area since December 1st of last year, it has been extremely convenient for the people to use them. In order to promote the widespread circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes within Huaihai Province, the Huaihai Provincial authorities have abolished the previous regulations that required a clear explanation for exchanges of value notes exceeding one thousand yuan, as well as restrictions on remittances, from the 6th. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. As the realization of currency unification is near, it is of great importance to the drop in prices and the stability of people's lives. Therefore, there is extraordinary attention and expectation from the general public. For this reason, the reporter made a special visit to various related agencies yesterday. According to the statement, since the Huaihai Provincial Government has been established, the adjustment of local currency is necessary. Moreover, the current rise in prices and the people's livelihood are all insecure. The further expansion of the exercise of reserve coins, especially local exercise, is due to the fact that the bank has not yet been established, so the amount of circulation is small, so it is not enough to apply. Now that the exchange restrictions with the United Reserve Bank have been lifted, and the branch is also scheduled to open, the future of reserve coins is naturally expected. Subsequently, the economic policy of the authorities, the general expectation of price reductions, can also be smoothly achieved. In the future, regarding prices, all stores must uniformly indicate the prices of reserve coins and the prices of United Reserve coins. However, the stores will inevitably have tricks in the future, and the authorities responsible for the treasure will strictly crack down on them at any time.</p>

<h3>Loose Cloth Transferred to Temporary Rationing. The Business and Trade Committee Reports to the Executive Yuan for Approval.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Cloth Shop Trade Association has separately submitted a report to the Business and Trade Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Shanghai Office of the Materials Review Committee, stating that the business of its members' cloth shops has stagnated and their lives have become increasingly difficult. They have also asked their members to sell loose cloth and give prices at rationing prices, with a one-time cash payment for relief, with three attached measures, requesting to handle according to the regulations. According to reporters' inquiries, the Business and Trade Committee believes that the various sections requested by the association are in requesting that all loose cloth be exempted from purchase, and specially prepared for rationing to citizens of this city. The meaning is that the rationing money obtained should be fully collected by the original applicant for sale, which is not in line with the originally promulgated purchase regulations. However, the cloth merchants in this city have suffered hardships due to the purchase of yarn and cloth this time, and sympathy should be given in the commercial collective position. For this reason, it is planned to approve the full collection of loose cloth from the cloth merchants by the association on behalf of the association for this temporary rationing. If there is any surplus, the association will be responsible for safekeeping and will be transferred to other rationing. The association has now submitted a report to the Executive Yuan for instructions, and a decision can be made after the instructions arrive. It is also heard that the Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee has also expressed its approval in principle based on the request of the association.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Donations for Student Aid from Those with Means; Hoping Readers Will Report Abuses; Receiving Many Accusations Daily, Awaiting Thorough Investigation</h3>

This newspaper has previously advised students of this type that those with means should not only avoid taking away the opportunity of education from those without means but should also donate as much as they can. If they insist on taking advantage through trickery, the truth will inevitably be revealed. This newspaper is now investigating based on the letters received. Once verified, in addition to demanding the return of the received aid from the guarantors, their names and facts will be publicly announced in the newspaper as a warning to those who attempt to deceive. At the same time, we hope that readers will provide timely and detailed reports. This newspaper will definitely investigate thoroughly and report back to reassure the enthusiastic donors.</p>
<p>Commemorating Deceased Son by Withdrawing Funds for Student Aid</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Yu Zhongnan saying: "My eldest son, Runfu, had an extraordinary intellect. In the 29th year of the Republic, he applied to St. John's University. He excelled in his studies and, after entering the school, immersed himself in diligent study, but his physical strength could not keep up, and he developed a heart condition. Despite my advice to temporarily withdraw from school, he did not heed it and eventually succumbed to his illness. My deceased son had unfulfilled ambitions and endless regrets. Considering that there must be many who are eager to learn but are hindered by financial constraints, I have decided to use the funds saved by my deceased son as a fund for nurturing talents for generations to come. I am hereby withdrawing 15,000 national currency units to contribute to your newspaper's primary and secondary school student aid program. I hope you will accept and handle it accordingly."

<h3>The Central Book and Newspaper Distribution Office Establishes Measures for Allocating Cultural Paper</h3>

If the self-report paper is used for other purposes, it may be converted at market prices.</p>
<p>Once the publications printed with allocated white paper are completed, they should be submitted to the Central Propaganda Department's Reporting and Distribution Office for verification. The following points should be noted:</p>
<p>A. The number of publications printed should match the quantity listed in the quantity budget form.</p>
<p>B.

<p>D. The remaining allocation paper from the previous time must not be used for other purposes and can only be combined with the paper for the next printing.</p>
<p>Publications printed with allocated paper, except for direct subscriptions and stored copies, must be entirely handed over to the Central Propaganda Department's Newspaper and Book Distribution Office for allocation to various retail stores for sale.</p>

<p>These measures are submitted to the Ministry of Propaganda for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Multiple Cases of Children Murdered for Clothing Discovered; Parents Should Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Municipal Government has reported, based on information from the First Police Station, that unlawful criminals in the city have been enticing young children wearing woolen clothing in the evenings to secluded locations, stripping them of their clothes, taking the items, and then strangling the children to death before discarding their bodies in rivers. For example, Shi Ronggen, a six-year-old boy who was victimized on November 24th of last year, went missing at around 6 PM while playing near his home at 112 Dashan Road.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Employment Issues</h3>
<p>The First District Public Office has been considering ways to train unemployed workers in the city and turn them into specialized commercial knowledge or special technical talent. The Social Welfare Employment Referral Section has also decided to take effective measures in the near future to strengthen its relationship with various industrial and commercial organizations to cooperate in solving the city's unemployment problem. This is an important task that meets the current social needs and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>In our previous discussions of industrial economic policy, the economy of the entire society, and employment referral agencies, we have always believed that increasing production involves the simultaneous concentration of human and material resources. We also believe that the achievements of the Allied Powers in handling employment referral services can be used as a reference for China today. This is because the severity of the unemployment problem is closely related to the economic issues of the entire society.</p>
<p>Solving the unemployment problem is not an easy task. The fundamental problem lies in the economic prosperity or recession of the country and society. However, the ways to solve the unemployment problem are nothing more than: training the unemployed to become talented individuals with special industrial and technical expertise and commercial knowledge; and introducing the unemployed to various production sectors, especially the family handicraft industry sector. Therefore, the widespread establishment of two types of institutions must be actively promoted: one is an institution for training unemployed personnel, and the other is an institution for introducing unemployed personnel. These two institutions must be actively promoted and strengthened under the joint efforts of the government and the people to initially solve the domestic employment problem in China. Assuming that the unemployment problem is solved by "treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts," it will be of no avail.</p>

<h3>Industry Evaluation Committee Begins Secret Investigation, Strictly Prohibiting Illegal Transactions by Similar Businesses</h3>
<p>The city's major commodity trade associations have established "Goods Evaluation Committees" with reference to actual conditions to carry out evaluation work. The agreed-upon standard limit prices for the goods operated by each industry have been submitted to the authorities for approval. Recently, the evaluation committees of various industry associations found that the member businesses of the industry association were not selling goods at the limit prices and were arbitrarily exceeding the limit prices in the hope of obtaining illegal profits. This not only violates the current charter of the industry association's evaluation, but also violates the evaluation purpose of the association. Now, the association is happy to accept honest reports from all walks of life, and on the one hand, it has sent personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If it is found that there are illegal transactions, the license number and address will be copied and sent to the association for punishment. Minor offenses will be warned, followed by fines as a warning, and serious offenses will be reported to the authorities to prosecute in court.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Illegal Transactions</p>
<p>The reporter has also learned that the industry associations are aware that the rising prices of all goods have not yet been eliminated. If this continues for a long time, people's livelihood will be at stake. Therefore, in addition to actively carrying out and requesting the authorities to fully allocate materials to increase the spot goods in the market, and assisting industry members to purchase from various production areas for continuous supply and sales, and processing and production, on the one hand, they absolutely prohibit member industries from engaging in illegal transactions. Regardless of buying or selling, only spot goods are allowed, and empty sales are not allowed. If such incidents occur, they will be severely punished. As for the sale of goods in stores, in addition to complying with the limit price, it is strictly prohibited to refuse to sell goods, reduce quantities, or use substandard weights and measures.</p>
<h3>Qian Industry Public Resolution on Checks, Requesting Payment Guarantee Method</h3>
<p>The Qian Industry Association, after serious discussion on the acceptance and guarantee of checks, has decided on a method. After the check has been added with the words "Payment is correct" by the holder to the bank, according to the provisions of Article 49 of the industry rules, the scope is limited to verifying whether the promissory note is forged, whether it has been reported lost, and other disputes. It is set up separately from the meaning of the check guarantee. In the future, if there are checks requesting guarantee, the guarantee words should be clearly stated to avoid disputes due to future resolution of differences.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Pay Teachers' Salaries Once Every Six Months</h3>
<p>— Tang Jingguo</p>
<p>The cost of living is now rising, and teachers are the most severely affected. Because the school's tuition fees are collected in full at the beginning of the semester, while the teacher's salary is determined according to the cost of living index at the end of the semester and paid monthly during the six months. During these six months, if the cost of living is assumed to double, then the teacher's salary is equivalent to a 50% discount, and one hundred yuan is only used as fifty yuan. If the cost of living is assumed to increase two, three, or four times, the teacher's salary will effectively be discounted in sequence. At that time, how can teachers use their salaries to maintain their lives?</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate that the school authorities and teachers should be open and honest and discuss a win-win solution. It is best to pay the teacher's salary for the six months in one lump sum at the beginning of the semester so that the teacher can arrange for their living needs for the six months as early as possible. If the school authorities cannot trust the teachers and are afraid that the teachers will not teach attentively after receiving the salary, they may use a joint guarantee method, asking the teachers to provide mutual joint guarantees when paying the salary. Or, pay half of the salary first, and use the remaining half of the salary to purchase physical goods, which will be kept by the school and paid monthly after three months. This</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Book Famine</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Since the price of newspapers has soared, the prices of various books and newspapers have also risen accordingly, and the most affected are various textbooks. Every time school starts, they must rise several times. Often, when you buy a book, you open the first page or the last page and it still has the price from the previous semester printed on it, so it is definitely not a new book, but inventory. A thin elementary and middle school textbook costs dozens of yuan, and the price of university textbooks is even more astonishing. A book that cost 100 yuan last year cannot be bought for less than 400 or 500 yuan this year. It is even more painful to run all over the bookstores and not be able to find a book. Going to the used bookstore to buy old ones is even more difficult, I am afraid it is more expensive than a new book. Outsiders will definitely be fooled, and even those who are familiar with the situation will hide the books and not buy them. Therefore, this problem is not only a matter of concern for school authorities and teachers, but also a serious problem for the entire society regarding children's education. Why? It is because when the cost of living rises to the point where teachers cannot maintain their lives with their prescribed salaries, teachers cannot teach to their full potential. Wouldn't that cause the children to be trapped in a difficult situation of dropping out of school?</p>
<p>Therefore, this problem not only needs to be resolved fairly and properly by the school administration and the teachers themselves in an open manner, but also all members of society must think about their children's education and urge them to implement it. The school's tuition plus a not small book fee is really unbearable for students' parents.</p>
<p>Investigating the reason for the soaring book prices, the impact of the decreasing amount of newspapers in stock is one reason, but the direct reason is that the current generation of booksellers, who are greedy for profit, have hoarded textbooks as ordinary commodities, waiting for a good price to sell them. And the most hateful and terrifying phenomenon is that it has been discovered that several university professors, who are known as the highest level of knowledge, are also taking advantage of this convenient opportunity to hoard a large number of university textbooks and engage in the business of petty merchants. This situation is really unimaginable for the educational future of Shanghai. Now that school is about to start, the passive solution to the book famine problem is the most urgent task today. Now I will only talk about the university aspect:</p>
<p>In terms of physics and chemistry, students can take notes without having to limit the purchase of any books. Even if there are no books, it doesn't matter, students will naturally look for references in various ways.</p>
<p>English often has a thick book, but only a few pages are taught in a semester, and then it is discarded and not read, and another book needs to be purchased, which is not in line with the principles of economy and "making the most of everything." Moreover, there is no need to force students to buy the latest edition of English books, which only makes the bookstores make money. Because English is not like modern scientific books, the content of old and new editions may be very different, but only some materials and chapters are added or subtracted. Now it is suggested that the English professors write a few essences in the book and print them into lectures, and distribute them to the students like a loose-leaf anthology, wouldn't that save the students a sum of money?</p>
<p>History can also be copied into notes. Books such as "Di Shi" are not something that students can afford.</p>
<p>The school library should purchase more reference books for various subjects, and more copies of each type should be prepared for circulation, and the library director should manage them strictly. Often, after a certain book is borrowed, the second person is often unable to borrow it again. Students should not regard public books as private, and professors should not occupy them without authorization, so as to prevent circulation.</p>

<h3>Sea Turtle (2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Navy Officer Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Section five of that song was what Bei Ren liked the most. When singing that part, he would unconsciously exert more force. It is said that the lyrics were written by a student of the 50th class during the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Naval Academy in the eighth year of the Taisho era. But looking at the lyrics of the fifth section, even twenty years ago in Etajima, there was such an understanding and awareness. This is something that we must deeply examine. Those few lines of lyrics are as follows:</p>
<p>Not seeing Western civilization,</p>
<p>Luxury mixes with anxiety and impurity,</p>
<p>Looking back at the Pacific Ocean,</p>
<p>Dark clouds densely cover the sky.</p>
<p>We, no longer</p>
<p>Fail the great task of this nation.</p>
<p>Chang Ren was shocked by "singing rest" for the first time in his life, so he progressed quickly. Even without the military band present, he did not forget the correct way of singing when he began to practice the school song under the guidance of upperclassmen. There was only one place where, for some reason, he always made mistakes in the lyrics. That is, he would change "We no longer exhort to sing" to "We no longer rise up."</p>
<p>(We no longer rise up!) When Ren goes to the garden, even in the solemn moment of lowering the warship flag, he will think of this sentence in his mind.</p>
<p>(It's not rise up, it's exhort!) Just as he thought of this, he would forget it again.</p>
<p>After a happy fifteen minutes of conversation before going to bed, the bugle for bedtime sounded. The students closed their mouths and began to sleep. Ju Ren also placed his hand on his chest, praying silently like a devout believer. (We no longer rise up!)</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>He barely overcame his weak singing of military songs. However, his swimming skills did not improve so quickly, so Zhen Ren was expelled to the red-hat class outside the ranks.</p>
<p>The summer schedule included early morning physical education and swimming time. Wrestling was also very popular during this period, but like swimming, it was not just a sport but a training exercise, and it was graded.</p>
<p>Zhen Ren hoped to achieve a certain level in swimming, at the very least. Sometimes he heard from student number three that diving was the standard for advancement. From then on, he practiced diving every day. Not only during the morning schedule but also during the afternoon practice time for those who were interested, he made sure to go to the diving board. His white chest was struck by the water, turning red as if sprinkled with wine. But he still jumped into the water repeatedly. Although he was the opposite of the frog of Ono no Tofu in behavior, he was quite comparable in spirit.</p>
<p>"A clumsy but persistent kid!" The swimming instructor, seeing Zhen Ren's practice situation, said to student number one next to him, "But his posture is too bad. It looks like a sea turtle falling into a pond. That will ruin his chest." "Should we tell him to pay attention?" "Don't bother. Let him do what he wants. With that kind of perseverance, he will naturally improve."</p>
<p>From that time on, Zhen Ren's characteristics gradually attracted the attention of those around him. His small stature, white face, and constant smiling made him seem unreliable to become a naval officer. Furthermore, he didn't go to the liquor store, and his seemingly money-loving attitude was viewed with contempt. However, they had to change their misconception about his extraordinary fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Why? Because nothing was more valued in this school than "fighting spirit." When Hirose Chuza was a student, he climbed Mount Koryu more than three hundred times, earning the respect of everyone. Even now, it is still a legend among the students.</p>
<p>However, Ju Ren's fighting spirit was not an innate character trait. And he himself knew that this was from his childhood, a stubborn mentality. The easily excitable and easily cooled nature of the Satsuma people flowed in his veins. In the school's prefectural association, it was often discussed that he was simply working hard because he lacked perseverance. Therefore, his fighting spirit was extremely unnatural. Sometimes it went too far.</p>
<p>He had considerable confidence in judo and wrestling, but he was extremely weak in marksmanship and swordsmanship. So he stubbornly exerted his fighting spirit. Even if he was being targeted, he would not be cowardly, constantly targeting the opponent. "Gu... you're a bit too tactless." His opponent would finally say with indignation.</p>
